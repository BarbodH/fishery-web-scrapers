I took to the ice roads in search of lakers for the last time this season today.    The portages and approaches are going down hill in a hurry and I doubt they will be drive-able next weekend.        As usual I was the first to arrive at the jump off point to my jump off point to my destination. I would find that I had quite a bit of company when I returned at the end of the day. There were another 8-10 trucks with trailers attached parked in the parking area.    Lat week I picked up another power auger off the local trader site here in town. It is an 8"" Strikemaster Mora bit with a Tanaka TIA-305 power head. I had heard nothing but good things about these power heads. They are comparable to the Husquvarna power heads. I will say I'm not disappointed at all. This thing is light, runs mint, idles like a dream and has gobs of power!!!!  Lots of snow still so the ice was only 4 1/2 feet thick.    Fishing was tough today. Well, not really that tough. I just sucked at landing fish.    Had fish under the hut all day but they were very neutral and would look but not chase or commit. Ended up with a total of 7 hits with 3 fish on and only one landed.        Even had a critter sighting on the lake today. Not really sure but I think it was a lynx. This hot is heavily cropped as the critter was close to 400 yards away.    Another gratuitous scenery pic.    A last look at the ice road on the way home.    And tomorrow nights dinner.    The season's not done quite yet though. I have a spot that I should be able to drive onto for another 2 or 3 weeks yet."
