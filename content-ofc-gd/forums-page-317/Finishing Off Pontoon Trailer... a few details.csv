My question is that I have stripped down a tandem boat trailer and ready to place support bars (4) across to hold the bunks.  The pontoon boat is a small 16' and was wondering:  1) Should the bunk lengths 2X6 be 16'?  Planned on 16' but saw some pictures of pontoon boats hanging a foot or so behind the bunk? The trailer is a 20' tandem trailer but I guess any extra space at the front is nice. The boat is a relative light one and its a tandem trailer (probably overkill) so weight balance isn't a huge factor.  The inner guide bunks will be installed soon also. "
