777524,Headhunter,2013-04-04 15:53:00,5703,"  Guys, I understand everyone's frustration, but bashing Crosshairs or any other First Nations member, will not do anything, but make the situation worse. They have the legal right to do as they do and until that changes, may I boldly suggest that we as anglers try to work together with First Nations for the betterment of all. If that really bothers you, take some time to read up on First Nations agreements... again, I don't necessarily personally agree with what's in place, but LEGALLY, rights are rights. The more I read and learn, the more I am beginning to think that the MNR are one of the biggest problems, the lake has. Is it a funding problem, a management problem, a political problem; sorry I can't answer that... but let's not alienate each other and allow the powers that be, to divide and conquer. HH"
777547,crosshairs,2013-04-04 18:14:00,55,"From what I have been told, the Cormorant population has boomed and has now stabilized to what the food source could sustain. If they were that much of a problem we would see perch numbers also dwindling, but instead they are also booming. The perch are starting to fill the void that is left from the walleye, supposedly once that void is filled it is hard to swing back the other way. It all has to do with so much energy in the food web and bunch of mumbo jumbo to me. I am sure it has been discussed, I just haven't heard anything of it.  I believe there is another Lake Nipissing summit being planned as we speak, and new this year OMNR is planning to participate so when it is announced I recommend all who can attend do so, personally I felt last years helped us all to see it from others perspectives and in the long run we are all fighting for the same outcome. A healthy lake for all to enjoy now and in the future."

For those that would rather exploit than preserve???  Expliot or preserve??? HMMM. Canada may well be on the list to??? I just wont admitt it.  As for NIPPISING . Yall better pull you heads up soon.
778083,JimC,2013-04-07 14:14:00,86,"I have taken the time to read each and every post on this thread and have learned some stuff, had some laughs,  and respect everyone's right to say what's on their mind.   As a North Bay born person,  my Dad took me fishing at an early age,  and though I now reside in S.Ont.  I have returned to a lodge on Lake Nipissing for over 30 yrs,  bringing my wife and kids since they were 1 yr old.     My daughter and husband now have a 3yr old son, and they join us annually for our family vacation.  This preamble is meant to indicate my deep concern for the future of the Walleye fishery,  and therefore the viability of the lodge we consider our 2nd home, and other similar, well managed businesses around the Lake.    I also make an early spring trip for 15yrs with friends to same place, but have noticed business is slipping big time in recent years. The latest move by MNR to cut daily catch (and by extension, total possesion) limits to TWO is just another nail in the coffin for some folks who have sunk possibly their life savings into what is their dream to operate a family vacation destination on Lake Nipissing.    What about them?     and what about my kids, and now, my Grandson, who may miss the chance to enjoy a beautiful week fishing on Lake Nipissinhg, in the years ahead?  My main point here, and subject of this thread,  is that I cannot understand why MNR has refused to allow knowledgeable volunteers to initiate and manage a restocking program,  with so much evidence of success stories, per links on this very thread,  plus the methods to do it,  ie.  gather eggs and sperm from native Walleye,    thus allowing the fry to grow some before being released,  and increase survival rate.   For sure  It is only part of a needed solution to a very complex problem;   however, I think it is totally irresponsible of the MNR to veto the offer made by Stewardship council and others.    Not sure where NFN stands on this,  maybe its in this thread, and I missed it?   Perhaps Crosshairs can shed some light (btw, I really enjoy reading your perpective).      If there is any sanity left in MNR brain trust,  I urge them to reconsider ... especially with knowledge that Yellow Walleye are a stocked species to Lake Nipissing in the first place."
778094,glen,2013-04-07 15:55:00,2641,Yep fishing is better when there is a chance at catching something. I remember how fishing used to be and that makes it hard to accept the way it is now.  We need better fishing right now.  What are they doing to improve fishing?  That is the sad part.
778399,Sinker,2013-04-09 02:44:00,8692,"Glen, your either fishing the wrong water, or your not a great fisherman. No offence intended, but I don't see anyone else complaining about not catching fish, just not being able to keep them.  That said, I know nothing about nip. Never fished it, or even laid eyes on it for that matter.  Its not hard to catch a feed of fish around here though.  S."

778422,fishindevil,2013-04-09 09:52:00,6254,Your right gerrit but we as a group of anglers are not allowed to speak the truth cause we might offend someone !!!!! Hey you live near Brighton just drive into shannonville at hwy 2 as see the natives spearing the spawning walleyes and filling pickup trucks for personal use !!!!! The opp are there as you are only allowed to watch from the bridge !!!!!! And they do it all night long with generators and big lights all setup !!!!!! Check it out its not far from your place at all
778424,Roy,2013-04-09 10:33:00,13728, Yet you only complain about one side.    You well know that these threads always degenerate into racial garbage. The topic at hand is not spearing in Shannonville but stocking on Nipissing.

778448,Fish Farmer,2013-04-09 13:10:00,2234,"With all the crap happening with uped gas prices, taxes, toll roads, launch fee gouging, etc. No money left when I get to Nipissing, and to just catch and release with no fish fry, I'll stay home. Sorry Tourism, like said before, the big bang is coming. X2 Gerritt, you said it, very true. Time for the Sheep to come out of the closet."
778450,Nipfisher,2013-04-09 13:17:00,2449," Gerritt, I have had this conversation about spearing with NFN fisheries, and several years ago when they implemented the moratorium on netting during the spawn they continued to allow spearing. My concern was taking ripe females out of the spawn but the NFN ""try"" to target male fish when spearing.  This year the NFN Fiseries is considering revisions to the 2013 fishing regulations. Here is the planned dates for this year, as stated in the www.nfn.ca newsletter for March 2013 This is a reminder that the gill net moratorium will be in effect from April 1, 2013 up to and including May 10, 2013. Our annual gill net moratorium is in place to allow as many walleye to spawn as possible and we are seeing the positive results from our management efforts.  The ice out is predicted to be late this year (exerpt fFrom North Bay Nugget April 9, 2013 - The North Bay-Mattawa Conservation Authority stated last week the spring thaw is about two weeks behind. The majority of Lake Nipissing remains covered in snow and ice, however there are spots of open water at the mouth of Chippewa and Parks Creek and along some of the shoreline. And it doesn't look like Mother Nature is going to be too quick to help.)  I have concern that if the ice is out late and water temps are too cold for spawning then the the spawn will be late. If the moratorium dates are not ammended then the spawning walleye will end up in the nets."
778455,Rod Caster,2013-04-09 13:24:00,5784,"Don't they milk the fish and replace the fertilize eggs when they spear? Other FN (Shawagina) do this and their fisheries are seen as healthy by the MNR. This would seem like simple, good management practice, no?"
778462,Nipfisher,2013-04-09 13:45:00,2449, Not to my knowledge but I am not NFN.
778465,Rod Caster,2013-04-09 13:59:00,5784,"From what I understand, this was the traditional practice during the spring spearing. I hope they haven't lost this practice."
778480,crosshairs,2013-04-09 15:11:00,55,"NipFisher, in regards to your concerns over late ice off since 2003 there have never been spawning walleye left on the spawning beds may 10th. Normally the whole last week there is minimal walleye on the shoals. Might count 20 all night on prime areas and they are just bombing around feeding. Usually males hoping for some strangler females. lol. Remember the nugget states when the lake is totally ice free. Last year it was april 11, but we were out in the boat patroling march 30. This year is to be back on track with normal years, I will be on the boat the last week of april sometime. The spawn will begin in certain areas first, wasi, west arm, then areas with open shores and the last is the shoal spawners in the big water.  The females don't go up to the areas until they are ready to go, the males will sit there for a month waiting, the female will go up one night and she is done. It is really interesting to sit and watch. A trick my dad showed me when I was a kid was to sit there in the dark and just tap my foot on the water (imitating a female splashing) and the males will come over to my foot and sure enough they did.  The walleye will spawn when the time is right, i have watched them in prime spawn with the ice 10 feet off shore.  JimC i beleive NFN is struggling with the whole hatchery issue. Their is alot of science against it but there is also science for it. To be honest I do not know where they really stand. Remember at NFN the politicians are the grassroots workers bosses, sometimes decisions are made on how it effects voters not what staff recommend or endorse. Personally i worry that if all these fingerlings and eggs are put in it will give this false idea that we all can keep taking out this amount of walleye or even more. Sustainability is only taking what the resource can reproduce, if the lake can only sustain so many #'s of walleye per year then that is it. This might be a stupid analyagy but when moose numbers are down less tags are given to allow a recovery, we do not breed them to try and help make more so we can keep taking. That is just my personal opinion, again I have nothing against the people wanting to do this. At least they are at the same table as NFN and wanting to do something.  RodCaster, some of the people out are doing this, they will spawn them out. The majority of people spearing are families with their kids, it isn't to make money or slaughter them, it is to teach the kids and keep traditions alive. With the commercial regs and spearing regs alot of people just don't bother to go out anymore. Wether it is the regs or just concern for the fishery or both alot have made that choice.  Also the same ripe female that might get taken is the same female that could have been caught all winter, a spawning age female is a spawning age female. Again i have nothing to gain from this except the opportunity to share information with you all and hopefully create a healthy fishery for my kids to enjoy. I have fished twice in the past 3 years and not once this year. I am not doing this so I can catch more fish. I have 4 boys and they are all taught to take only what you need, and to respect all fish and animals we harvest. I take 1 moose and 1 deer a year and this feeds my whole family of 8 people. I usually just run out of meat the week prior to school starting. Soon we will go for smelts then for catfish, sometimes my mom will ask for suckers to can so the boys will come and help get some for grandma. (BTW she just adds ketchup and it looks like salmon). We eat rabbits in the winter and occationally we will get a beaver from a trapper. We try not to purchase as much as possible, you don't know what is in any of our food anymore. This is a choice we make, others have to do this just to get by.  Anyhow if anyone feels I am speaking with deception, to somehow gain something out of this mess I am sorry. Again I am just sharing information that alot of people donot know, when I was in CO training the whole class was so upset with what they learned there in regards to their FN neighbors. What made them most angry was that they never learned any of this stuff through school. I had 1 elderly gentleman in our class come up to me and appologize for hating us his whole life only to find out why FNs are angry, he said told me to share my information, knowlegde with anyone who wants to learn because they don't know.  Anyhow I appologize to the admins, again i am not talking about stocking on lake nipissing but I feel people need an understanding of the whole situation on both sides. Thanks all and have a great day."
778489,Nipfisher,2013-04-09 15:46:00,2449,"Crosshairs, Your input is greatly appreciated, you are a valuable resource to this board and I always look forward to your comments. My comments are not intended to be anti-NFN. I apologize if they come across that way. I was happy to see that NFN is always reviewing and revising their regulations.  I may go try and see the walleye at Wasi or South river this year.  Don't get me started on the smelts...lol. We are not allowed to target Nipissing creeks, streams, or rivers until they cross Hwy. 17 (North side)  . No smelts run that far. Same with suckers however I know of a few places to get them legaly. I have tried the suckers and they are pretty good. The guy who introduced me to them eats it cold with salt and pepper after it has been cooked in margerine. In the spring (after opener) there are tons of smaller catfish to be found in the weedbeds around our trailer.  Nice picture in the newsletter by the way.  Blair"

777381,glen,2013-04-03 18:15:00,2641,Example.   Pickerel within 2hrs of barrie. Most lakes are not worth fishing. Years ago you could catch a feed.

777388,glen,2013-04-03 18:34:00,2641,Take a poll and ask if people would like better catching.

777391,glen,2013-04-03 18:39:00,2641,A better catch rate on all fish.

777400,glen,2013-04-03 19:12:00,2641,I know the other ways.  Having terrible fishing on a lake for 20 years that used to be good is unacceptable.

777408,ecmilley,2013-04-03 19:32:00,2163,"theres no point in stocking a lake if certain other conditions don't get met, be them harvest or enviromental or baitfish, stocking is a good idea if can kickstart a self sustaining system but yeah so many factors out there to consider"

777428,SylvanOwner,2013-04-03 21:23:00,266, There was also a spawning bed rehabilitation component to this issue.  Sound like anything we've read further up the thread?  It's not a single component that's going to fix the problem.
777430,Steve,2013-04-03 21:39:00,2075,"glen, your not going to find a lake 2 hours from barrie if all your looking for is a feed.  that's the problem.  folks only care to feed. hence no fish.  if you stock, then they get eaten.  where's the logic in that?  i don't see the difference in buying fish from a store and catching stocked fish from a lake..... you get your feed either way."

Also you talk about "" your government "", it's your government as well, no matter how much you wish it wasn't. It was my government that threw my grandfather in an internment camp in Pettawawa  which is a nice word for POW camp in 1939 and held him there until 1945 actually 3 months after VE day, it didn't matter he took a piece of shrapnel in the skull fighting in WW1 for the Brits as a Canadian.

777452,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 00:01:00,8243,???????? Translation please. I know plenty of walleye guys on Balsam whom don't kill everything they catch. In fact I'm one of them.
777457,beagle dad,2013-04-04 00:36:00,224,i'm talking of the masses amount of walleye fishermen on the kawarthas other than balsam is crazy i'm a witness to the movement of fishermen through these lakes not talking here about those that just want a feed    talking about those that move lakes cause slot fish easier to catch there and easier to limit out time after time... tell me how easy it is to catch a legal walleye on balsam compared to rice. sturgeon.pigeon then tell me how easy it is to just catch walleye on these lakes legal or not point is fill a lake with fish is fine  but realize that it would not take long to empty it  without limits..  we need to quit messing with mother nature.. slow the slaughter of our resources....let the stocks build back up

P.S I have NO problem catching a limit of eyes on any of the kawartha lakes mentiones in this thread, any time I want. The lakes are cyclical, and if you know which one to be on, and when, walleye are easy to catch! Overall, the population is rising if anything. The decline in fish had nothing at all to do with fisherman, or fishing either.  S."
777475,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 01:38:00,8243,"Beagledad,  Ok, I hear you. There are always going to be the guys that fish to eat, nothing will change that, in generations to come as catch, possession limits drop, slot sizes get tighter the next generation will accept it as normal. Just as we started to catch and release in the late 70's my father in law and uncles wanted to throttle us for letting a very good fish go. These guys grew up during the great depression. I've seen them fillet largemouth the size of your hand, and yes yanks seem to be the worse offenders. I've seen it first hand, half of my relatives are American, I'm going to catch holy hell for that statement. If you had food in hand you didn't throw it away, simple as that. And you never let a big pike go, you opened the pike up and froze as many walleye fillets in that would fit. That was the mentality, and if any of those old timers still fish they could care less about a slot limit. So you can thank them for the rules on transporting fish with skin on it. Do you know how many fights we have had when they want to bring back as many walleye that would fit in a cooler in my new truck. What da ya mean they can take your truck for a few pickerel?  We go to a 300 acre lake in upstate NY every year for Pike opener, more of a family reunion.  Big fish of the weekend was 15 pounds 25 years ago, now it's lucky if you get a 3 pounder. And guess what they fillet hammer handles and say the fishing isn't what it used to be!!!!!!! No limit on crappie, so they tell me, and fillet every minnow that ends up in the boat.  I hope they all live forever, but I bet the fishing gets better when the WW2 vets are gone."
777480,Sinker,2013-04-04 01:49:00,8692,"There's not a thing wrong with keeping a limit of any fish for the table! Fisherman have the least amount of impact on a fishery. Get that out of your heads, and look at the BIG picture.  There's a lot more going on than guys keeping fish.  S."
777522,crosshairs,2013-04-04 15:32:00,55,"Old Ironmaker, I am not harping about past injustices I have a government I vote for and you have one also. Simply because that is my belief doesn't make it harping. Looks more like your harping about what happened to your grandfather. People need to speak up against injustices and fight for what they beleive in, and not worry about being told ""get over it"" or quit ""harping"" lol. If people don't stand up and fight they deserve what they get.  The 80 000 mentioned is just based on 10 weekends, 2000 huts and 1 angler in each thus this could be the very minumum number. The point is the NFN government has first right to the resource (the higharchy works like this 1]conservation is very top 2] first nation subsistence 3] first nation commercial 4]sport fishing) so before first nation commercial can be stopped anglers will have been stopped prior to this. This is taught at CO training, and the first right is based on the 3 court cases. They could just tell OMNR this is what our community needs and you manage what is left, but they are chosing to work with everyone to still only have the finger pointing at them. I have a feeling their tolerance for this is soon going to end, because they will always get blamed no matter what.  I have been looking at alot of info and asking myself Why is the lake in this situation??  NFN has been fishing this way for centuries (noted in jesuit records)  (NOTE: blue walleye were fished out for food for the war not by FN's) elders mention they remember there were no walleye for along time. And tourism has always been big, ice fishing has grown. So I started to look at the data and this is what I have come up with.  The OMNR decide what the safe harvest level is based on population. I think 5 years ago it was at 66000kg, OMNR estimates for angler harvest for the whole year on some instances were as low as 10 000 and 7000 kg. Now NFN takes that data and establishes their quotas and was set around 46000kg 5 years ago and quota was reached only once. 66000 is the safe harvest level remember.  Now this past winter OMNR is estimating anglers harvested about 14000kg of walleye(just winter) and the estimate for the lakes safe harvest level for all users is now 30000kg. So almost half is gone already now NFN has their qouta (they haven't decided what changes they are making to it yet) plus soft water anglers. So what is the first nation suppose to do?? In the past NFN have been reactionary to the angler harvest and adjustments to quota can be made quickly compared to government (omnr)red tape but OMNR have no control on how much anglers will take out. Past estimates for entire years were 10000kg and now with a lower limit 14000kg are caught in just 3 months. Crap data in puts crap out. I now see why over harvest has been occuring. I don't beleive the safe harvest level of 66000kg was accurate and neither are the harvest numbers OMNR has been using.  The lake needs a quota. Once this number is hit it is shut down just like NFN does when they hit their quota. How does the quota get divided up ?? I have no clue. The over harvesting has been occuring due to the fact OMNr has taken a back seat in lake Nipissing management, inaccurate data screwed everyone. Anyhow if we could get the numbers back up and keep accurate catch data the lake and all users would be fine. i think these strong year classes are our last chance at saving this thing.  Just my thoughts, take care all."
777120,Headhunter,2013-04-02 16:01:00,5703," If native involvement is increasing, let's hope that they are more willing to tackle the cormorant problem, then the MNR seem to be. Yes, we caught more Pickereyes this winter than we have in the last five. That said, out of the 20 or so our group caught, only two were in the slot. All others were below or well below the slot.

I realize that First Nations have their rights (agree or not it doesn't matter, nothing will change) so we as anglers should be concentrating on things we can change. -stocking the lake - somebody do it! Frankly as an angler, I don't care who does it, as long as it gets done. -removal of cormorant nests and a cull of all those flying rats  ALl other issues as far as I can tell, might as well be cast in stone. Nothing is going to change that, even if there was/is a will to do so. HH"
777139,Headhunter,2013-04-02 16:58:00,5703,"Oh... and by the way... my family DID NOT GET A FEED of Nip Pickereye's this year... did I catch enough for a feed for four... yup! Did I release all but two, under the slot... Yup! Could I have kept a slot fish, yah, I could have, but that is not what people who respect the law do... so no Pickereye dinner at my house! HH"
777147,crosshairs,2013-04-02 17:14:00,55,"I didn't say that at all, i said everyone taking fish is to blame. The first nations 40 000 walleye is nothing to the 80 000 plus angler harvest coming out. Please don't walk on egg shells on my behalf, and you are right by the time your government shuts the angler walleye fishery down and the NFN shut down their walleye fishery it will be to late. Hence the political grandstanding."
777150,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-02 17:21:00,8243,"Great discussion all. I posted earlier here that I believed the reason the ministry denied the group permission to stock was the concern over introducing VHS disease into the fishery. Maybe maybe not. What I do read here is a repeating opinion that the lack of enforcement by the MNR as a problem.  Going to the root cause it wouldn't be a lack of enforcement it would in fact be those individuals keeping more than 2 walleye a day. We always think of poachers as someone netting, spearing, trapping and using explosives to get dozens or hundreds of fish at a single time. If a sports fisherman keeps only 1 more fish than allowed per day, for any reason, that person is simply a poacher. Be it when limits were 6 and no slot size or now."
777151,crosshairs,2013-04-02 17:23:00,55," My family either, don't have time kids hockey keeps me running all winter long. Kind of embarrassed to say this but tilapia isn't that bad. lol"
777152,jedimaster,2013-04-02 17:26:00,3472,Part of the concern of when and how the NFN takes fish is that they are taken in the spawning grounds. Let them breed in peace at least. jmho
777159,crosshairs,2013-04-02 17:42:00,55," I agree totally.They have regulated the spawn, there is no netting anymore a minimal spearing for personal use. The 4 strong year classes coincide with NFN's spring moratorium, it is working.  NFN has the same problem OMNR have, they have to be careful because these are constitutionally protected rights. It is working now because it is community driven, community had a vote and hence the laws came into play."
777160,beagle dad,2013-04-02 17:44:00,224,stocking not the answer imo look at the whole picture...the oceans for example...tell me its not overfishing that's the problem the more u put in the more they will take in Ontario lakes
777171,jedimaster,2013-04-02 18:11:00,3472,"The whole point of self sustaining is to have the natural breeders replace the ones taken out. I don't think anyone thinks that is happening. Need to reduce the take on all fronts, clean up and protect spawning grounds, and let the current breeders spawn. A few years of ""No Take"" on ALL fronts with a vastly reduced take would go a long way.  There are some risks involved with farming and what not, by inadvertently introducing disease and poor genetics. Look at what is happening out west with the Salmon. All good intentions but look at the result."

777192,Rod Caster,2013-04-02 19:06:00,5784,"People have probably harvested more walleye in Nipissing this year than in other years, simply out of spite.

776884,Headhunter,2013-04-01 17:34:00,5703,"Yellow Pickeral were introduced into Nip in the 50's, if my memory is correct. Native Pickereyes were what we call Blue Pickereal... netting and over harvest destroyed the stocks. The MNR introduced Yellow Pickeral to replentish the lake. In a nut shell, Yellows are not native. If folks were really intenet on helping the fishery, they would be patrolling the lake, this spring, looking for and disabling nets strung across spawing rivers and creeks. Something needs to be done about the cormorant population as well. It's quite evident from many of the other threads here that nothing can or will be done with the commercial fishery and it's take from the lake. And yes, this was our best ice fishing season on Nip with many under 14inch fish caught. HH"

776964,Nipfisher,2013-04-01 22:34:00,2449, HUGE fines for manipulating or removing nets. Enforced by MNR. My friend got one caught in his prop (damaged his skag) and he dragged it to shore. It was unmarked and had no tags on it. Guess what? When he reported it he was charged by MNR and investigated by OPP and native police.

777025,dhickey,2013-04-02 01:48:00,1038,Wallies live to be anywhere from 12 to 20 yrs old depending on presure. (fishing and water conditions) They start to spawn at 3- 4yrs old They do not need rivers to spawn.  You guys may be in for a 6-7 yr lull in pickeral fishing. Go after the muskie that is their biggest problem.  Be prepared to see the slot size increase. MNR posted a study saying that the fish being cought havent had the chance to spawn therfore the fish are younger than 4yrs old but fit into a slot size that is not alowing the fish to reproduce?? The same study also pionted out the fact that they grow into the slot size at a younger age2-3yrs not being mature enough to spawn. This would sudjest that the fry have a good food chain in front of them and very little competion? Thus they grow at an excelled rate?  My take on it. Not only that but given climate change over the past few years its easy to see how warmer temps could cause fish to grow at a faster rate  along with other problems such as alge blooms.  Granted I am not a scientist but an avid outdoors man and I see changes on a regular bassis. It becomes our responsibility to adjust and preserve..

777054,solopaddler,2013-04-02 09:48:00,8605,"For those of you stating that walleye stocking is a band aid solution and isn't the answer I beg to differ if done properly.  Just south of Nip lies Memesagamesing lake. A large deep, clear shield lake that's part of the Pickeral River system.  When we first fished this lake 27 odd years ago catching a walleye was a rarity. There was a remnant population but certainly not fishable numbers.  Can't remember the exact year but round about 15 years ago the outfitters and cottagers association on the lake started their own walleye hatchery run by volunteers all with the MNR's blessing. They net wild native fish from the lone spawning creek each spring, strip them of eggs and milt, then hatch and raise the fingerlings in tanks adjacent to the spawning creek. When they're the right size they're released back into the lake.  About 10 years ago the walleye population in that lake exploded and it's now an incredibly vibrant and healthy fishery with not only numbers of fish, but trophy sized fish.  I've seen the results first hand and have been amazed, it's a true success story.  The same thing could easily be done on Nip. But on Nip it would only ever be a band aid solution if native netting is allowed to continue.  "
777077,Rod Caster,2013-04-02 13:18:00,5784,"That is at Matthews Camp (at least they were one of the groups doing it)...they have now stopped that program, I believe due to the fact that it was successful.  I believe the First Nations will be managing lake Nipissing very soon...the MNR will work in tandem with them, with their blessings. Just a guess, but I don't see how things are going any other way right now."
777079,solopaddler,2013-04-02 13:32:00,8605," Johhny Mathews played a part for sure, but the two driving forces behind the program are Dave Weber of Camp Sagamesing and Tom Beck of Parolin's Camp. Both have devoted countless hours to the program and continue to do so.  It hasn't been stopped either, it's still going strong. I toured the hatchery facilty with Tom Beck when I was up there in Feb."
777093,crosshairs,2013-04-02 14:43:00,55,"I know Commercial netting is always mentioned, and the misconceptions all start coming out so here is some information on the NFN harvest.  Nipissing first nation commercial fishers for the past 2 years have been harvesting under 20 000kg, add in nets lost, due to weather or tampering, corrections for catch forms etc the harvest is bumped up to 26000 kg. Rather than talk weight lets talk fish, this equals roughly 40 000 fish. 30% of these are biosampled by the biologist. Enforcement is auditing 4 random days a week, observing catch while lifting, checking all gear is legal etc. There is about 10 commercial boats out per night. So the enforcement ratio is pretty high and all biologist reports are peer reveiwed.  They are doing this voluntarily, and are being held to the highest standards. Documentation is very important to them, and personally I think they are preparing for a court case, either defending themselves or challengeing the government for mismangement.  Sure it is natives policing themselves, but who is policing the anglers??  There is no sound data for the angler harvest, creel is voluntary and enforcement well outta my 30 plus years on the lake I have seen them twice, and that includes me setting nets for personal use, spearing and angling. This is nothing against the Co's their orders come from peterborough.How ever it is spelt.  Now NFN commercial takes out 40000 fish lets add 10000 for personal use for a total of 50000 fish for the community. Anglers have 10 weekends from Jan to March closing. Lets use the 2000 huts with 1 angler in shack all weekend. Day 1 he/she catches 2 walleye for dinner so he/she can fish on day 2 to catch 2 more to take home. That is 8000 fish a weekend or 80 000 fish over the winter (weekends) not including during the week or soft water. And we all know there is only 1 per shack.  We`are all to blame for the situation. NFN has a set quota, it has been at 37000kg for the past few years and this years regs are being reviewed according to our their newletter. Anglers do not have a quota, only an individual limit so there might be 10 anglers or 100 000 anglers.  Like I said earlier, we are all to blame and if we don't take alittle pain now there will be a whole lotta pain later on. The political grandstanding on both sides needs to stop and the right thing needs to be done. The NFN moratorium people laugh at just happens to coincide with the 4 record year classess that anglers are now catching.  The walleye are growing faster, so they are being caught before they get a chance to spawn. The trick now is to get these strong year classess to spawning age, and having enough fish for all users. Not sure how that is going to be done, I beleive the Total allowable harvest for the lake is estimated at around 30 000 kg for this year and estimates are winter anglers caught 14 000 kg, almost half is gone with no summer angling and no NFN or Dokis or Metis harvest. These are numbers heard through the grapevine.  Personally lake needs to shut down to all (walleye fishing) for a couple years and re evaluate, other wise we will be looking at a perch fishery.  Hope this makes some sense, I tend to jump around with my thoughts. I appologize.  Have a great day all."
777095,crosshairs,2013-04-02 14:48:00,55,"NFN has also asked the OMNR if they would train NFN enforcement to be full fledge CO's, and NFN would still cover the wages sinse they are on the lake alot and have several issues hunting. 2 extra people on the lake and in the bush at minimal cost seems like a win win, but OMNR have not responded since late November. So do they really want to work together with any group to help better things, I think their actions speak volumes."
777101,Nipfisher,2013-04-02 15:11:00,2449,"Clayton, I am so glad you have taken your time to comment here. The theme of this thread is in response to the MNR dismissing the private stocking program presented by the LNSA. I certainly do not blame Native netting for the downfall of the walleye population however, it plays a part as you mention. This was the best walleye year in many on the Lake but these caught fish were generally 12-20"" and premature for spawning. I would LOVE to see more enforcement on this lake. I feel many anglers realize there are few MNR in this area and are rarely seen on the big lake. Therefor the take advantage of good catch days and may keep slot sized fish as well.  The concern I have for the netting is only that ""anglers must release slot sized fish but they can be harvested in the nets. I know the net ""squares"" were adjusted to allow smaller fish to swim through and I believe many bigger fish can hit the nets and swim away without getting caught however those prime spanwers get caught for harvest. Agreed that slot sized fish were kept in huts and bungalows this winter."
777103,Rod Caster,2013-04-02 15:19:00,5784,"Beautiful! I hope this gets realized. Again, my thoughts are that NFN will get more and more control of the management of the lake."
777104,Nipfisher,2013-04-02 15:20:00,2449,"Clayton, and others who may have missed this post by Rod Caster. I like the thinking Chad. Hope you don't mind that I re-posted it in this thread.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=67033&page=4  Posted 28 March 2013 - 07:02 PM The MNR didn't reduce the catch limit because of the decline in walleye, they did it as an olive branch to the First Nations... imo.  If my opinion is at all correct, then here is my supposition: they are not allowing the private stakeholders to stock the lake because, there isn't a need for it (fish pop's are not that bad) and the MNR is trying to reduce their own and private industry involvement. What they may be aiming for is a larger contribution from FIrst Nations on Lake Nipissing (and other lakes), which may mean that they are leaning towards the FN doing more in terms of lake management and/or stocking. The FN already wants more control of these things and some bands already do significant stocking/management programs. If the MNR is starting to pass-on the torch, then they won't be making any significant management decisions...as we are seeing right now.   The way I see it, the FN may actually do a better job at managing the lake than the MNR ever has.... if they have full control and the proper resources. How many of you are actually happy with the way the MNR manages things up north, or anywhere else for that matter? They keep getting cut back and seem to have less and less ability/talent to actually make proper decisions. If the FN have it their way, I think they'll do a great job because they won't hold a grudge anymore and they'll be working with a lot of pride...with a lot of prove.  All my opinion.... The MNR just seems to be at a stalemate on this topic, to me, this is a valid hypothesis."

776608,Nipfisher,2013-03-31 14:17:00,2449, I wish you would read the article before making uneducated comments like this. The stocking program proposed is privately funded. The MNR is saying no to something that will not cost them anything. There is no harm to be done by the stocking and more fish in the lake is good for anglers and netters.
776609,moxie,2013-03-31 14:18:00,1566,Sounds about right. No matter what the article says there will eventually be cost associations lest anyone believe only in the story the ink tells. Shell games are just that.

776685,glen,2013-03-31 19:10:00,2641,"The problem with natural reproduction is the spawning sites have been ruined by people. Most of the quality fishing is from stocking. Stocking works very well and we need more.   In the wild, out of the million eggs, you might have 1,200 fall fingerlings survive, he said. If we take 100,000 eggs and are able to raise 5,000 of them to fall fingerlings."" The Ministry again turned down their proposal citing that the risk was too high, although Nelson questions how that could be when the report states zero pollution."

""its not about greed""  Personaly I think that Nippising is far to exploited and its about time to let it bounce back. The MNR has made public all studies.  Personaly I believe in the cycle system that pretty much all lakes go through it then becomes the responsability of anglers to do the right thing no matter how much it hurts. Weather it be Nippising or any ather lake big or small...  It may be time for those that make their living off the fishery of Nippising to adjust in order to protect a natural resource..  My piont is that if im only alowd to keep a fish no bigger than a perch on Simcoe then why spend the monney to make the trip?????  As for the MNR we can all find fault.

Are these people holding out on the golden ""answer"" and just want to tell everyone what a waste of time and effort they are partaking in, all while they know exactly what should be done?  please tell, to avoid the shell game.  If people choose to raise money and donate time in the effort of an improvement of a fishery, what is the problem people have with that? Is there many people that they know of that are pocketing money from these programs, becoming rich from these situations or something i am unaware of ? I don't know of any of these hatcherys that are claiming to be the all out answer, and if you don't help or support, your a bad person. Its simply concerned and interested people trying to help or improve. What is the problem with that? Please tell.   Then tell what should be going on instead.

776754,timmeh,2013-04-01 02:25:00,609,"Problem is that no matter where the funding comes from stocking is not a cure for declining fisheries. It's a bandaid that attempts to cover up the symptons but does nothing to address the underlying cause.  And that cause is plain and simple overharvest. Anglers, as a group, have an absolutely terrible history with responsible management of our resources. It's a take your limit cause I can attitude and then complain when the fishery isn't what it was or could be. And then ""fix"" it by stocking more fish so we don't have to change our attitude."

That brings on a whole new sort of circumstances into the mix and blows hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of resurch out the window. Intoduce a different genetic pool is a last resort. Bottle neckiking is prety much a foregone conclusion. Protecting the native stock is the key.  IMO Increasing the slot size will probably be the next step?? Reserch backs it up..
776761,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-01 02:48:00,8243,"One of the most successful stocking programs for Walleye is in the state of Minnesota according to the article below. Over 3 million dollars annually is earmarked for the program by the state.  Follow this link for what one would consider a successful program. They stock hundreds of lakes that won't support natural reproduction solely for the purpose of sport fishing.  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/volunteer/mayjun11/walleye.html  If we are going to have a debate lets do it with some facts not rhetoric. Now I'll look for a site that says walleye stocking doesn't work.  Within 15 minutes I came across this article from Michigan. A good simple read as well clearly explaining why they have suspended stocking efforts for walleye in neighboring Michigan. The introduction of VHS from lab invitro fertilization. The 2013 Ontario Fishing Regs talk a out VHS diseased fish, basically the fish bleeds to death internally. I'm sure the MNR faces the same risks associated with disease introduction into the wild. I don't want them stocking walleye either if it can effect an entire species of fish across the province. Thank you to Michigan for being cautious as we share large aquatic borders that fish cross with regularity.   http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_46403_63473-234576--,00.html  The Nipissing article states, quote  Their proposal to the MNR was to harvest 200 million eggs. Nelson says they were told it was too large a take in the event of a catastrophic failure that could have a negative impact on the natural spawn.  Catastrophic failure is not defined, I'm sure that definition from the ministry would explain much as to why not, and I'm sure it was described in detail to the proposed stocking group that wasn't passed on to the reporter."

While people are discussing, certain fish stocks are declining and we need to do something to staunch that until all parties can come up with a workable answer that makes everyone happy (or relatively at least).  I may be wrong but I thought roe were taken from Nipissing stock in this case ?"

776771,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-04-01 03:10:00,0,"natural genetics is always key.  stocking is a bandaid solution IMO whereby the problem is in overfishing/habitat destruction.  if you don't address the problems then the fishery is doomed in the long run.  nipissing isn't so far gone that a natural population can't be maintained.  what needs to be addressed is the loss of habitat, overfishing (commercial AND recreational), invasive species, and the funding that goes to agencies tasked to protect the resource."
776774,glen,2013-04-01 03:24:00,2641,Stocking will give me fish to catch. I like stocking.
776775,Nipfisher,2013-04-01 03:25:00,2449,Great discussion guys.
776777,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-01 03:47:00,8243,"I have to add, it is best to leave the science to the scientists and the fishing to the fisherman.  Notwithstanding however much needed input from us is most important, look at the success seen over the years with salmon and trout programs that only became successful after guys like Daryl Chronzie,(sic) and others became involved. But after reading further about the importance of laboratory conditions I don't believe a few well intentioned individuals should be doing any lab work, without at least under the MNR's stringent supervision."
776780,mcdougy,2013-04-01 05:51:00,274,All hatcheries are under MNR supervision.  You can not just start doing this stuff for the fun of it.
776833,Pickeral eater,2013-04-01 14:25:00,155,Now I'm aware that many people depend on nip for their living and many if us enjoy it for recreation. What about a ban on Pickerel altogether? Catch and release for a determined amount of time.  I'm not too sure how long it takes for a species to regenerate but after spending a good amount of time on simcoe this winter it sure seems to have worked for the Cisco. It will be a bitter pill to swallow for many of us but it allows a natural strain to regenerate and helps the fishery survive for many years to come. I believe it took almost a decade for Cisco numbers to return. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Bill

776849,Nipfisher,2013-04-01 15:41:00,2449," I would be fine with them banning cisco on Nipissing. It is a nuisance (garbage) fish for most ice anglers on Nipissing. Walleye is the the ""bread and buttter"" species for almost ALL anglers on Nip. I never objected to the 2 fish reduction on the walleye limit and it was my best ice season in a couple years."
776853,ecmilley,2013-04-01 15:52:00,2163,"what genetic strain needs protecting? walleye is not natural to nip and is a stock fish to begin with stock away I say, rehabilite some stocking grounds to get natural recruitment numbers up, responsible harvest ,actual enforcment and polluting laws will all help bring nip back to it's former glory"
776854,jedimaster,2013-04-01 15:52:00,3472,Ther eis no one thing that will regenerate a lake. To think its this or that or this is just silly. Its purely mathematics. You take out more fish than what are reproduced and the levels will go down. The questions are. How many fish are born and survive each year. How many fish are being taken out by recreational anglers. How many fish are being taken out by aboriginals. How many are taken out by commercial fishing. How many are taken out by poachers.  Trying to just add osme fish without knowing or having a good idea of the rest of the numbers is just a stopgap that in the end could actually do more harm than good as it could lead to covering up the real problems.
