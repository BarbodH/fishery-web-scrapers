778640,RJackson,2013-04-09 23:42:00,113,One of our funnest trips of the winter and we didn't even catch a fish!Joined our friends Darren and Sherry to a piece of heaven they've stumbled onto....we knew we were in for a treat when this guy greeted us on the way up.Like I said the fishing was tough for us....this could be why... Darren and Sherry each got a nice fish each just to coax us into coming back 100%!Likely the highlight of my ice fishing season was having a visitor on the ice....yes two Moose sightings in one day.I was getting desperate!  HELLO?!?!?!?!Wrapping up my ice season with this trip was great.  Laid back and relaxed was the plan and it worked out great.Time to wet the Lund!RJ
