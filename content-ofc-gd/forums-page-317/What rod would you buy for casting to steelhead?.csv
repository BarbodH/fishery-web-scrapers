779020,Rich,2013-04-11 17:25:00,3927,Lol np man same to you.. for real. We are on the same page here right? This was worthless except for entertainment value? Lol
779021,BillM,2013-04-11 17:28:00,17367,"It's all fun and games man, seriously it's all good"
779052,Rich,2013-04-11 19:49:00,3927,"Haha, right on. Thanks for the education on spey casting, really. i actually thought it was a type of fly. Lol"
779092,Rod Caster,2013-04-11 23:05:00,5784,"hahahaha, you guys lost me after spoon chucking....   Seriously though, thanks to everyone who helped out on this one, I know exactly what I'm looking for now... now, it's time to find the right sale/deal and I'll have my steelhead/river rod."
779118,ketchenany,2013-04-12 00:14:00,3229,CTS is the way to go. Problem solved.

778743,BillM,2013-04-10 12:28:00,17367, I'd love to see someone try and spey fish with an ugly stick...   That would be hilarious!
778820,bare foot wader,2013-04-10 18:15:00,1354,"LOL spey and ugly stick don't belong in the same sentence, you'll get the purists all riled up....ugly sticks are only good for swinging dee's ha"
778821,BillM,2013-04-10 18:19:00,17367, I'm not sure how spey got brought into this thread to be honest.  It's on a completely different level then your typical spinning setup.   It's not like you toss your Sahara on a Uglystick and start swinging flies with April Vokey
778822,Rich,2013-04-10 18:20:00,3927,A 9' xtra lite action ugly stik lite? Im sorry but the only unbelievable thing about swinging speys on that is that it's too long.
778825,torco,2013-04-10 18:48:00,656,"I can second the convergence, I bought it a couple years ago on sale and it has been good to me. Nice rod for the price."
778833,solopaddler,2013-04-10 19:04:00,8605," Sorry dude, but whaaat?"
778836,Spiel,2013-04-10 19:10:00,9065, I'll second that.
778840,BillM,2013-04-10 19:16:00,17367, I think you should figure out what spey fishing is before you attempt it with an Ugly Stick...    What you're saying makes zero sense.
778876,Canuck2fan,2013-04-10 23:10:00,1444," NEED? heck no want heck YES... I spent the first 2yrs fishing for steel with the Catera I mentioned before and it did it all well. Then I got a deal on a couple of Swan Company noodle rods and they ARE still a blast to use. Athough they don't chuck spoons worth a crap they do the float and bottom bouncing thing quite well. Then I got gifted an old school Berkeley 10.5ft piece that has been run over, dropped, left behind twice but it still will do the trick.... I then decided to get a small river float rod 8.5 for crawling through the bush.... Then there are the ""mistakes"" I bought along the way, with too much handle or not enough sensitivity. Anyhow I learnt a long time back to always TAKE 2 rods on any trip, after seeing friends have to stand there for a few hours till I was ready to drive them home when something broke or got pulled in by fish who were quicker than they were... So having a few to choose from helps in that regard although it definitely does not help catch more fish though LOL."
778878,bare foot wader,2013-04-10 23:14:00,1354, you'd never see April fishing that setup....Mariko maybe lol
778899,Burtess,2013-04-11 01:10:00,901," Has such a rod ever been produced?  Anything ""Ugly"" I have ever seen has been heavier when over 7 foot....  Burt"
778937,Rich,2013-04-11 10:12:00,3927," Well I do it with a 6'6 baitcast setup and that works fine.  My bad. This technique only works in relatively small creeks. If your river is huge, for sure you need fly gear cuz nothing else will get the fly out there.  Flip, drift, strip. You do not need a fly rod."
778938,Rich,2013-04-11 10:18:00,3927,"The Ugly stik ""lite"" edition is much lighter. Yes still heavier than a lot of the rods out there but definitely light enough to float with all day if need be."
778961,BillM,2013-04-11 12:37:00,17367,"  Ok, so what you are doing isn't spey fishing...  I've toss a fly and split shot on my UL setup more then a few times.  Great way to catch residents."
778968,Rich,2013-04-11 13:50:00,3927,Never got any residents doing it. Maybe cuz I dont use a split shot.
778969,Rich,2013-04-11 13:52:00,3927,"Dude I know you steelhead 100x more in a year than me, but that doesnt mean there are black and white rules on how to do things. A spey on any line is still a spey, and if presented the same with a fly rod , or a stick and string, doesnt matter, it is still spey fishing."
778974,BillM,2013-04-11 14:03:00,17367, What you described would be refered to as  'swinging flies'.....    The 'spey' in spey fishing refers to a specifc type of cast.  Try using the correct terminology and you'll get less    replies.
778989,troutologist,2013-04-11 15:12:00,951,"At least you guys get to debate steelhead rods with a chance to fish for them....damn you prairies.  The St Croix Wild River 8-10'6 have been my gear, bouncing, plug fishing rods of choice, they will work in a pinch for float fishing too.  On another note I would watch the heck out of a video of anyone spey casting with a baitcaster."
778991,porkpie,2013-04-11 15:19:00,2521,"You really only need 2 rods max, and really if you just want to fish a few times a year, you could find a medium action 6-10 rated 10.5 foot rod, and do everything with it, including float fish, bottom bounce and plug or spoon chucking!   With the use of fluorocarbon leader material, gone are the days when we used the 3lb leads.  My minimum is 6lb now, and I will use 8lb depending on conditions.  There is no need for a boatload of equipment, unless of course you are into speys.........lol.  Like anything though, the more involved you are in the sport, the more likely you are to spend a boatload of money.  As far as chasing fish?  It would have to be a mighty big fish to move me more than 20 feet from where I was standing!"
779006,Rich,2013-04-11 16:39:00,3927,"Oh jesus, i am SO sorry. Wow. What a huge messup I made here. Worst mistake of my life. I'll just slit my wrists now. Guess that old timer that taught me how to do it on the banks of the big just didnt have his terminology correct. Dont worry tho, next time I see him I'll knock his haggered patootie out for teaching me disturbingly incorrect terminology."
779007,BillM,2013-04-11 16:41:00,17367," You're such a drama queen....   You're like the little kid that can never admit he's wrong and will just go on and on arguing the point.  It's ok man, you're right... You feel better now?"
779009,Rich,2013-04-11 16:45:00,3927, Grow up.
779011,BillM,2013-04-11 16:51:00,17367,Take a bit of your own advice
779013,Rich,2013-04-11 16:54:00,3927,"Glad I could make your day, troll."
778330,Rod Caster,2013-04-08 22:36:00,5784,"Looking to spend around $100. I was thinking 8-10 feet long and used with a spinning reel.  I don't get to fish to often for steelhead, so I also want to use it on big rivers for walleye, catfish, maybe carp etc.  I prefer a stiff and very sensitive rod... casting no more than 1/2 oz lures.   I'm assuming ""steelhead"" rods are used for float fishing more than casting??  I'll price out/research any suggestions on this thread. Thanks in advance."
778333,solopaddler,2013-04-08 23:05:00,8605,"I fish with hardware almost as much as my float rod and I'm pretty picky about my rods. In general you want a rod with a little more oomph than you might normally choose. I prefer a rod with a soft sensitive tip and a rigid lower 2/3 with tons of power, preferably between 10 and 11'.  Off the rack a great value (but more than your budget allows) is the 101/2' St. Croix Avid rated 8-12lb. The same rod rated 6-10 is ""okay"" but not quite as ballsy enough for my liking.  A cheaper second choice off the rack is an 111/2' Raven IM6 rated 6-12lb.  For me I can't find ""precisely"" what I'm looking for off the rack so have no option other than to have one built. I'm currently fishing a fast action 11' CTS rated 6-10lb and it's fulfilling my needs quite nicely.  One final note, when throwing hardware for steelhead you don't have to finesse them, it's totally a reaction strike. For all the same reasons I run braid for other species I also do for steelhead. Recently I've been running 15lb power pro super slick with a 2' fluoro tippet of either 10 or 12lb test.  Real gorilla stuff compared to my floatfishing set ups, but it's a completely different style of fishing."
778337,Rod Caster,2013-04-08 23:24:00,5784,"Thanks for your input Mike.  I guess an 8 foot rod isnt really that much longer than my 7"" st croix. I'll look for longer models as you suggested.  Your line setup is pretty much exactly what I use for casting rainbows. Can't beat braid for casting long distances with fairly heavy spoons/spinners.  What is the descriptor for the type of rod you are referring to? Float rod? Steelhead rod?"
778339,solopaddler,2013-04-08 23:29:00,8605,Steelhead rod would be the most fitting descriptor.
778340,Canuck2fan,2013-04-08 23:33:00,1444,"If all you want to do is float fish or chuck metal, you are ignoring one of the best methods for catching chrome. Bottom Bouncing!!!! I haven't yet found a rod that does all three types of fishing perfectly and the only rod that I have come across that does all three very well is a Shakespeare Catera IM-8 11.5 ft with a michigan handle. Sadly they don't make them anymore. Definitely the best 69.99 I ever spent on a rod though. What makes it better than the other 5 or 6 rods I have as an all around rod is the fact that the last 4 eyes before the tip are single foot and all the others are double foot giving it incredible backbone and strength to drill spoons incredible distances. The tip is extremely sensitive so by changing the way you load up the rod to cast you can get great casts with a float and keep the worm on the hook. For bottom bouncing you can cast it far with a light setup of split shot and then feel the difference between a rock and bite as it bounces along.  I personally would look for any 11.5ft plus rod in my price range. The 10.5 or less I find don't have the casting power I want, without having to use way too much weight. (which can snap a tip off even the most expensive rod) Also the more weight and effort you have to use will tire you out that much faster if you are going to be out fishing for 6 or 7 hr trips.  However, if you can find Quantam 10.5 ft Michigan handle steelhead rod they are a good compromise, the (Scam)ano convergence 10.5ft with the michigan handle is a good rod too.  The regular handle convergence or clarius is way too long for chucking spoons you will find it wrapped up in your coat almost every cast... or least everyone I know who has one does."
778341,Rod Caster,2013-04-08 23:34:00,5784,Cool. One of the local shops is a St-Croix distributor.... I'll go take one for a test drive.
778342,BillM,2013-04-08 23:36:00,17367,Check out the Shimano Convergence line.. Cheap and they do the job.   I've landed all kinds of steelhead/chinooks with mine.. It's nothing fancy but the fish don't seem to care very much    Right around the $70 range.
778343,Rod Caster,2013-04-08 23:41:00,5784,I'm definitely a metal chucker.... usually only do one or two steelhead trips/year and it's a 50/50 split between river mouths and piers.  Great advice Canuck... and I'm googling your suggestions as we speak.
778346,ketchenany,2013-04-08 23:47:00,3229,"Mike fishes a CTS (Canadian Tire Special) Sorry Mike, with my connections I better give CT a plug even if they don't carry them!"

778358,Burtess,2013-04-09 00:37:00,901,"I guess I buck the trend here and go a little shorter.  I use a Quantum Energy QES8642FAC 8.5ft medium action 6-12lb.  It casts pretty far spooled with 8lb mono.  I chose this rod because it is so light, the longer you go the more tip heavy these set ups get. I use the 10.5ft Convergence for fall pier salmon but I cut a few inches off the butt to solve the handle caught in the coat issue.  Burt"
778363,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-09 00:53:00,8243," Would a long steelhead rod be referred to as a "" noodle rod? ""  I don't rainbow or steelhead fish but I remember the crew talking about noodle rods, if it's not a noodle rod exactly what is a noodle rod?"
778372,kickingfrog,2013-04-09 01:21:00,8333,"Often yes, a long rod used for steelheading would be called a noodle rod but that would not be acurate. Noodle rods are not really good for casting spoons, spinners and plugs. They have a fairly uniform arc (or parabolic curve if you want to sound mathematical)."
778374,BillM,2013-04-09 01:26:00,17367," Noodle rods were all the rage back in the day.. They've pretty much have zero back bone and bend well into the handle.  Even with a parabolic curve a rod can have some balls (Take an IMX for example)..   Noodle rods probably killed more fish then anyone ever imagined, lol!    I can't imagine trying to cast with one of those things.   It would be like casting a spoon with one of my custom Fenwick fibreglass rigger rods."
778375,Nipfisher,2013-04-09 01:32:00,2449,"Chad, I know nothing about steelhead fishing but I think I may have a rod that will work for you. When my neighbor's husband passed away a few years ago she gave me his fishing stuff. They were from Southern Ontario and he was a river fisher. She gave me 2 Daiwa VIPGX 66 rods. They are 2 piece 8.5 foot rods Medium Heavy Action 12-20 line rating.I really have no use for them and they just sit in my basement. Come take a look and see if that rod suits your needs.  Anyone know anything about these rods? NOTHING on the net about this exact model."
778377,Rod Caster,2013-04-09 01:38:00,5784,"Awesome, Blair! I'd love to take a look at those Daiwa's."
778425,Rich,2013-04-09 11:04:00,3927,"Do you want it for float fishing, bottom bouncing, hardware, drifting, or speys?  Cuz ya pretty much need a seperate rod for each application."
778431,BillM,2013-04-09 12:11:00,17367," There's no reason why you can't bottom bounce, chuck hardware and drift floats with the same rod...  That shouldn't be very difficult..    No need for 8 different rods to catch steelhead, lol."
778435,Fish Farmer,2013-04-09 12:35:00,2234,"Bill, I can't see anyone wanting to fish for Rainbows ( sorry, Steelhead) in a ditch with a 13' piece of Spaghetti with a cloth's line pulley while in spawning. I'd sooner fish with a ice fishing rod for Sheephead. Like you say, a good 7' rod and spinning reel chucking a spoon and a Rainbow, Bass, Muskie hit, now your talkin fun. Sorry guys, just pulling your chain   each to their own. Now I got to cook up Perch and Eggs for breakfast, see ya."
778440,BillM,2013-04-09 12:43:00,17367," Me either...  Ditches aren't on the top of my list of places to fish  :)    Either is trying to entice fish while they are on the beds, lol!  This is why when opener arrives, the steelhead gear goes in the closet until fall.  I like chasing residents with the 4/6wt or chucking tiny spinners on UL gear."
778446,Rod Caster,2013-04-09 13:01:00,5784,"mostly for hardware, a bit of bottom bouncing... I'd use it for walleye on big rivers as well.  We do a yearly manitoulin trip, my 6'6"" med-light isn't enough, my 7' med-heavy is too noodeley and both are too short."
778575,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-09 20:47:00,8243,"Maybe that's why I never got into rainbow and steelhead fishing, I would never be able to afford all those rods. And I never knew the difference between rainbow and steelhead, very confusing for a simple walleye and bass guy. Besides I don't want to walk 10 miles chasing a fish down a river, hard to do with a cast on your leg!"
778710,Rich,2013-04-10 09:57:00,3927,Anything light enough to properly float fish will bust if you try chucking spoons on it... Trust me
778713,Rich,2013-04-10 10:01:00,3927,"Ahh, okay. When I broke into steelheading a few years ago with a similar attitude to the old ironworker, I wanted the same thing. and honestly, I've had a bunch, but I'd reccomend the ugly stik lite steelhead/salmon rods. Near indestructible, competitively light, and can pretty well handle it all. I've had mine for 6 yrs. The only thing its not great for is speys, or float fishing. But will do those things."
778738,Rod Caster,2013-04-10 12:17:00,5784,"Ok, thanks Rich I'll take a look at it. Indestructible is good in my possession  Had someone PM me that the Rapala Northcoast 10"" MF was a good unit...in my price range too."
