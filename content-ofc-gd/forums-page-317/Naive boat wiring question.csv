778908,kickingfrog,2013-04-11 02:09:00,8333,"I'm comparing a few used boats and was wondering how easy is it to change a 12volt trolling motor plug/wiring to 24 volt?  Ballpark, what would a dealer charge for this?  "
778921,landry,2013-04-11 02:51:00,1005,"U can do it yourself in an hour. I did and I am not handy. Change to 6 gauge wire, marine. It necessary, add in a minn kota breaker if one is not there and u may need a new plug outlet. Total cost around 140 for connectors and everything. A dealer will charge u 200. That's my guess"
778922,BillM,2013-04-11 02:52:00,17367," Depends on what amperage the plug is rated for...  The Minn Kota plugs (MKR-18) will do 12, 24 or 36V..  Rob, if you need help re-wiring anything, just drop me a line."
778923,irishfield,2013-04-11 02:54:00,26272,Gonna say.. depending on what the oem install is on the boat it will work no matter what.  If it was wired for 12volt originally...  24 volt draws half the amperage for the same thrust motor so nothing needs to be changed wire wise.
778955,ecmilley,2013-04-11 12:15:00,2163,fairly straight foward so long as you have room for second battery. some installs i run 4 wires up to plug and it's crossed there others i jump the two batterys together and run two wires to the plug. with required breakers ect.
