779095,Rod Caster,2013-04-11 23:15:00,5784,"who can affort $5 in this economy?? hahaha  Not a fan of giving a company money, to allow me to spend money .... MEC of all things, isn't about getting great prices, so I suppose its a moot point anyway.Oh well, i didn't REALLY need that rain jacket anyway. I think I strongly inherited the Garage-Sale-Gene from my Dad."
779125,BillM,2013-04-12 00:28:00,17367,I really like MEC.  They have all that hard to find stuff you just can't get at Canadian Tire or BPS..    I buy all my cold weather undergarment wear from that place.   Just picked up some Salomon 4D GTX hiking boots as well!
