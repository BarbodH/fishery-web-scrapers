779322,captpierre,2013-04-12 21:05:00,2521,And they are 4 stroke I'm sure!
779323,kickingfrog,2013-04-12 21:07:00,8333,"Don't know about that, but the fuel they use was described as one step up from asphalt and needs to be heated to enable it to flow."
779325,Rod Caster,2013-04-12 21:17:00,5784,Crazy...fueled with pitch. I'm guessing no fuel filter?
779358,Fisherman,2013-04-12 23:08:00,7201,Far as I know they are actually 2 stoke diesels.
779368,Roy,2013-04-12 23:40:00,13728,"It doesn't appear to be that big a ship. According the GM, fuel mileage may vary...  Its current destination is MOSSELBAAI."
779377,danc,2013-04-13 00:39:00,4677,A co worker fired up a boiler at a pulp mill last week. I'm pretty sure he told that it burns 6 litres of fuel (some type of oil) per minute.
779384,kickingfrog,2013-04-13 00:53:00,8333,"Six, or 600 litres, it's still zero mpg if it's not movin'."
779385,danc,2013-04-13 01:03:00,4677,My point exactly.
