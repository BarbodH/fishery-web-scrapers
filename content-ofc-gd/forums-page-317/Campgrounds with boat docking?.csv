779073,jedimaster,2013-04-11 21:55:00,3472,No but you can at balsam as well. However they told me its not a good idea as people steal stuff from the boats. Better to find one with room to park the boat in the campsite.
779123,bow slayer,2013-04-12 00:26:00,1074,"I have been and docked at both sharbot and emily. Both have good docking but they are located rather far away from the actual campground, Sharbot docking area is fair distance from the camping area.Both places i just launched and put it back on trailer when done for the day and parked it on the site.I would be pretty hesitant to leave anything of value in the boat there. Six mile has good docking which is right tight with the campground,but you have to pay for your docking there. There are some great parks that have sites in which you can beach your boat right at your site in view at all times, restoule,bonnechere are 2 but not sure how far that is for you."
779130,bow slayer,2013-04-12 00:44:00,1074,maybe also check out silver lake....just a couple minutes away from sharbot lake...it has some great waterfront sites where you can beach your boat at.
779174,porkpie,2013-04-12 03:27:00,2521,"I have camped at Emily many times, and at balsam and finlayson as well.  I never felt comfortable leaving my lund at the dock overnight, so yanked it every day.  Now that I have just a 14 foot tinner with a 15hp, I will occasionally leave it at thr dock overnight, but completely stripped and chained to the dock.  The camp staff will warn you straight out of the potential for theft! Just an FYI"
779177,sofabed,2013-04-12 03:55:00,119,You can also try Lower Buckhorn as well. I am in one of the campgrounds on Balsam lake and never had an issue or heard of any issues there but it is not the provincial park.
779278,Sinker,2013-04-12 17:42:00,8692,I think you'd be better off staying at a trailer park myself. Lots of them have docking.
779354,Beans,2013-04-12 23:04:00,3339, I understand Sandercock's Camp on Rice Lake near Roseneath is back in business under the name Dunette's Landing Campgrounds...they rent out spaces for tenting and cottages and they used to have docks and a launch...
779369,Sinker,2013-04-12 23:42:00,8692,"I think if you ask around, most trailer parks have camp sites, and docking. I'm not a big fan of provincial parks. Too many rules to break!  S."

779564,sofabed,2013-04-14 00:14:00,119,Sandy Beach Resort on Balsam lake has trailer sites and your boat is docked behind the site. It also has a boat launch.
