772353,ah_long,2013-03-07 13:41:00,354,some of these deals might interest you  Markham tackle store sale  I think the Revo SX is a great performer at that price
778699,redpearl99,2013-04-10 03:14:00,259,"I just wanted to post an update and once again thank Angler Management and Danbob for giving me their old rod and reel.  I now have a nice Abu Garcia Blackmax and BPS extreme casting rod for this year.  I think it is a great first time baitcaster combo.  Thanks again guys, much appreciated"
778704,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-10 05:07:00,8243,"To answer your question angler I think folks starting out are wary sinking $$$ into something they might not use, as well as, and with todays economy is very important is budget. The poster might be a high school kid without the means, I said might. Yes I'd rather someone get into a good baitcaster now rather than get frustrated trying to toss a small jig on it and quit.  And you offering your Abu Garcia is absolutely fantastic. Way to go man. Very generous of you, in fact I'm going to start a new thread on donations of equipment to kids.  EDIT/ I posted after the first page by mistake and see Danbob has contributed as well. Fantastic you two."
778716,moxie,2013-04-10 10:16:00,1566,Own 3 Citicas and 2 of them are E's. Awesome reel for the money. Own a BPS Clunn I've had for years with no issues as well.
772057,redpearl99,2013-03-06 04:39:00,259,I'm looking to get an inexpensive baitcaster.  Does anyone have any comments on the above noted sets? thanks
772060,chris.brock,2013-03-06 07:53:00,4053,"buying a cheap bait caster is trouble, even if you're experienced, it will be a nightmare to cast  I'd say the Curado is the reel to buy, about $150, it's a great reel too, I've had one for almost 20 years of abuse, I still prefer it over my more expensive bait casters"
772063,Rich,2013-03-06 10:43:00,3927,"If you're gonna go with entry level gear, go with shimano.  I had a Crestfire ($80) for 7 years. Worth every cent. I'd still be using it I:m sure but my own mistake broke the seat off the reel."
772082,Fang,2013-03-06 14:27:00,1330,"BPS has some decent deals on now for your first bait caster. The Extreme reel is a good buy. Assuming from your post that it's your first baitcaster that it will be a general learning reel and used for all round casting which is just fine for this reel. I own 6 of the Extremes now and have found them to be durable, easy to cast and a great value when they go on sale. For spinnerbaits, topwater,.... these are fine reels  Will they flip a 1/4 oz jig like a Curado or Chronarch - NO! but I have been using these as a flipping reel on a bit larger baits and they perfom wonderfully. I have more expensive baitcasters but they will come to you all in good time.  You can buy 2 Extremes at that price for what a Curado will set you back. Pair it up with a Bionic Blade or Tourney Special at BPS and you're set for your first outfit."
772087,redpearl99,2013-03-06 15:09:00,259,thanks for the info.  How often do the Extremes go on sale?  What i'm looking for is an intro baitcaster that I can use for my crank baits and some of my heavier lures.  I liked those rapalas because they are on sale and the rod ratings were for 3/8 -1 oz.
772094,redpearl99,2013-03-06 15:28:00,259,where do you see these amazing deals?
772095,BillM,2013-03-06 15:31:00,17367," The BPS flyer.  As for a beginner reel, Shimano Citica without question."
772119,redpearl99,2013-03-06 16:24:00,259,"I saw the flyer, I just didn't see any amazing deals.  Their sale prices seem to be on par with Lebaron's regular prices"
772123,Dan668,2013-03-06 16:39:00,1120,"The daiwa lexa is a good reel for the price. If your starting out, i would recommend the shimano citica or curado. Easy to cast with. The extreme is also a decent reel, my brother started with it."

772197,Angler management,2013-03-06 23:08:00,280,"I dont get why ppl buy starter reels... What a waste of $$$. Buy a proper reel the first time, and u dont go and buy a better reel a couple months later. The curado is an amazing deal at $160 dollars when u take into consideration that a high end core is $400 plus tax. And is not really significantly better... Just lighter and smoother. Save the $$$ u have till spring to make the purchase."
772201,captpierre,2013-03-06 23:15:00,2521,I love Rapala lures.  I hear their rods and reels are less than great.  Is this the conscenses or am I wrong?
772226,bare foot wader,2013-03-07 00:21:00,1354,"no opinion on rapala reels, haven't used them and not inclined to anytime soon  have put some rapala rods thorugh their paces and mixed opinion  when they first started making rods they were excellent value for money, I have a tournament long cast that is about 7-8 yrs old i guess and love it..rebuilt the handle, new cork and fuji reel seat, i really like the blank  newer rods, not so good...have been though about 5 or 6 north coast rods and 2 finesse rods...the rods are value for the dollar and well designed...but poorly built, warranty is no good to deal with  the reel seats in particularly are attached to the blank with cardboard and glue....they will spin around the blank.,...with that said, for the price, i fixed a few myself and still use them, if they break I won't be too choked about it  warranty is crap to deal with...the store sends the rod back, wait 6 months, to find out if rapala decided to warranty or not"
772240,redpearl99,2013-03-07 01:02:00,259,unfortunately I dont have $160 to spend on a Curado.

772284,Angler management,2013-03-07 02:39:00,280,Do you use left or right hand?
772288,redpearl99,2013-03-07 02:45:00,259,i like the Nitro z tournament reel that will be on sale at Basspro next week for $50.  But it only comes in right hand while i need left hand retrieve.  http://reviews.basspro.com/2010/1201111008121/bass-pro-shops-bass-pro-shops-nitro-tournament-z-low-profile-baitcast-reels-reviews/reviews.htm
