Up until last year I would fish once maybe twice a year...mid summer of 2012 I bought a 9' inflatable with a 7.5hp and found myself fishing A LOT   Now here we are in 2013 and I upgrade my boat to a 11.6' Boston Whaler and plan on finding myself on various lakes within 1-2 hours drive from Whitby.  I have many questions about fishing and boating and look forward to everyones feedback / guidance.  Cheers, Matt "

778848,Can_38,2013-04-10 20:23:00,152,Thanks...just like everyone else I'm waiting for that damn ice to go away.  Yup Whitbytonian: last year I could leave my driveway and be fishing Lake Scugog in under an hour.  I assume if I search this forum hard enough I'll find boat lauch recomendations for all of the various local lakes eh?
