779156,Tony68,2013-04-12 02:34:00,31,"Hi everyone new to the board. Every year I try to pick a different place to spend a one week summer vacation in  Aug. with my 2 boys fishing. Some of the areas I've fished so far are Simcoe, Bala, Picton and Bancroft. I was just wondering if anyone has any recommendations on any other places to try. I live in Toronto don't mind driving 2-3.5 hrs. to location. Not asking for any hot spots but the fishing aspect of it would have to be first, (keep the boys interested) second accommodations(don't mind roughing it a bit). Any input would be appreciated. Thanks."

779178,Tony68,2013-04-12 03:56:00,31,"Cottage, my own boat."
779251,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 15:19:00,6899,I'd be looking at French River or the Kawarthas. I've lived in both areas and love them both.
779254,Tony68,2013-04-12 15:28:00,31,How is the fishing at the Frech River in Aug.
779264,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-12 16:29:00,10439,"I used to spend the 1st week of August fishing Wolsley Bay on the West Arm of Nipissing. Stayed here: http://www.fishtale.ca/ Got my biggest musky @ 53 1/2"" and my biggest large mouth bass @ just under 7#'s here at that time of the year."
779332,Tony68,2013-04-12 21:32:00,31,Is there a lot of pressure and boat traffic on the French River ?
779394,Tony68,2013-04-13 01:44:00,31,"Wow I see there are a lot of rental places and cottages for rent on the French, so I guess there would be some pressure and traffic. What area is the fishing better upper or lower French?"
779395,Big Cliff,2013-04-13 01:54:00,6899,"I prefer the lower but that is because I lived in that area and knew the river well. Wolsley Bay would be a good place to start for someone new to the area. It would be a good idea to get a guide for a day if you want to make the most out of your trip and get to learn a bit about the river. It isn't a good idea to just take off in a boat without someone who knows the area, there are some rocks that hide just inches under the surface right out in the middle of nowhere."
