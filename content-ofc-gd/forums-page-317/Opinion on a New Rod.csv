779010,bman32,2013-04-11 16:48:00,27,"I'm looking at investing in a new rod for musky fishing up in the Kawarthas. From what i gathered a 8'6 Extra Heavy, Moderate Fast to Fast rod is somthing i should be looking for? I primarily want to throw spinnerbaits, like Mepps Musky Killers, and some hardbaits. I'm a pretty tall guy, 6ft+ so rod length isnt really a concern. I'm not really into trolling around, mostly throwing lures. Any prefered brand?"
779022,Luke V.,2013-04-11 17:30:00,286,Most guys on here will vote for st. Croix I would second that vote!
779027,ecmilley,2013-04-11 17:58:00,2163,first off welcome to the board x2 on the st.croix as the rod of choice
779034,kickingfrog,2013-04-11 18:38:00,8333,"No prefered brand, I'll just rip on someone else's choice.  If you are jumping in with both feet, have at it St. Croix make some nice rods. Shimano also has musky specific rods that won't break the bank as do some other brands. Lots of choices."
779037,esoxansteel,2013-04-11 18:54:00,1307," Throwing lighter size musky baits like you would be throwing, i would scale to a hvy action rod, with some slight tip flex, your rod length based on your height would be fine, in fact for those baits like musky killers, and also bomber long a mags etc, i use a flippin stick with a low profile bass reel spooled with 65lb pp, casts a mile and works great for those baits, and smaller creatures etc. if you want a musky rod the Tackle Industry ones are nice, without the hefty over rated price of a St. Croix lengent tournament, the cork on the TI is thicker then other brands which might benefit you if you have big mitts and you can buy 2 TI's for the price of a legend, and still have enough money left to spool both outfits, and TI's are very light as well"
779051,landry,2013-04-11 19:47:00,1005,Tackle industries xh would be a good choice but good luck getting one shipped to Canada.
779053,Roy,2013-04-11 19:50:00,13728, E Tackle has them I believe.
779054,lew,2013-04-11 19:59:00,12766,"I'd make it a Compre and get a Med Heavy, that'll be perfect for spinnerbaits."
779064,landry,2013-04-11 20:47:00,1005,I don't think they do any longer. They r not on site. I sent him an email a while back asking but did not get a reply.
779115,bman32,2013-04-11 23:50:00,27,"Thanks for all the replies and the welcome. St. Croix seems very popular and I will definitely look into the tackle industries,I have a 7'6 mh xf crucial flipping stick, I wasn't too sure if that would be the wrong rod for a musky, considering its more of a bass rod, and if a good sized musky would over power it"
779163,moemoe,2013-04-12 02:59:00,352,"Just got a ti xh rod, they do ship to canada, but it is crazyyy expensive, almost as much as the rod, I got it shipped to cbi shipping in the falls for 5 bucks, they are on special now for 135$, I haven't used The TI rod yet, but I have fish with buddys st croix legend and the st croi is a defintely nicer, but definetly more cash....other rod I use is the new shimano compre im9 xh, the TI rod seems to have a nicer feel, but like i said, not water tested yet!"
779217,bigbuck,2013-04-12 13:14:00,2449,"If you will be using it as a general purpose rod, go with a heavy action. MH wouldnt cut it for for jerk baits and the like.  Okuma is another option for some semi affordable rods."
779221,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-12 13:34:00,455," i would also agree that a med/heavy would be fine for a smaller baits that you have mentioned. if you do decide to troll, this rod would also be ok for smaller baits at slower speeds.  now throw a 2-3 ounce spinnerbait and troll it at 4-5 mph and your arms may get tired pretty quickly.  if your plan is to stick within the kawartha's and cast mostly i would suggest an 8'6 med/heavy or heavy. the compre's are a bit heavy and i dont like the 2 piece rods the way the new ones are.  i would suggest a st croix mojo musky or premier if your on a budget. if cost isnt an issue go with a st croix legend! the trigger grip alone is worth the price.  good luck"
779247,Harrison,2013-04-12 14:59:00,2202, Sorry if we missed it Landry. I'll look into that now.  Okuma EVx is a good quality rod for the money. The New Daiwa DMX Musky rods are sharp too in that price point.
779260,landry,2013-04-12 16:17:00,1005,I know u r busy Harrison and I was not offended by not hearing from you. We did talk earlier last year. Your customer service is excellent. I could see that u dropped this product and I ordered from tackle industries instead.
779338,trapshooter,2013-04-12 22:03:00,1234,"The St. Croix Lenend Tournament ""Sling Blade"" is  8'6 Heavy Fast.  I use this rod for almost everything.  It would be a great choice for a one rod solution."
