Since packing both a fly rod and spinning combo would take up a lot of room I was looking at this setup. It's a convertible rod, so it can be a spinning rod and then you can unscrew the butt to make it into a fly rod. Originally I had planned to build one but I don't think I'll have time for that anymore so I'm considering buying it. Has anyone used this combo? I know white river usually isn't too great but the reviews seem decent. Thanks!  http://www.basspro.com/White-River-Fly-Shop-Fly/Spin-Rod-and-Reel-Combo/product/44266/  Edit: I know some have had bad experiences with the reels, I can always switch out the reels, just really want to know about the rod"

779347,BillM,2013-04-12 22:39:00,17367,I'd bring an ice auger
779372,Christopheraaron,2013-04-12 23:56:00,3525,"LOL Bill I hope not. Brian, although it would work I'd prefer it be plan b, if the rod is decent it would be useful for a lot of other trips."
779373,BillM,2013-04-12 23:58:00,17367,"Just make sure you're prepared with worms... If it's cold, you'll have to force feed them."
779374,Christopheraaron,2013-04-13 00:20:00,3525,yup I'll definitely have my fair share of worms  Are you allowed leeches in the park?
779399,Nipfisher,2013-04-13 02:45:00,2449,Crystal River makes a cheaper version of the link you posted. It comes in a foam pack with both reels. I think it is $30 at Walmart or Can. Tire.
779406,Christopheraaron,2013-04-13 03:41:00,3525,Thanks Blair! Have you tried it?
779411,dhickey,2013-04-13 05:26:00,1038,If it converts into an ice fishing rod as well I want one.  Years ago I used a spinning reel on my fly rod and had a blast .  As long as your not throwing any thing heavy I think the rod will hold up Ok.
