777373,Angler management,2013-04-03 17:49:00,280,I was wondering the same thing...lol just didnt wonna sound like a noob.  :s
777383,MJL,2013-04-03 18:25:00,2427,Unfortunately it doesn't look I can make this year  It's a great event to help lift steelhead over the dam.  It's your chance to unleash the inner Loogan           
777386,Angler management,2013-04-03 18:31:00,280,"Thats cool, cant imagine it being hard to find volunteers..."
