779341,irishfield,2013-04-12 22:17:00,26272,Yah... and they're cheaper to maintain too Rob !!
779344,Steve,2013-04-12 22:29:00,2075,"hirk, you know, as well as I do, why merc sells that many more motors than yammy.  and it has nothing to do with quality."
779349,irishfield,2013-04-12 22:42:00,26272,"It's called product placement Steve (Brunswick corporate buy out  and positioning to say the least).. If Yamaha could build a better boat then the G3.. they'd get there!  Both great motors... the GMC./ Ford / Chrysler debate never serves any good...  I had a 4 HP Merc when I was a kid of 6 years old.. it still runs (hate to say 45 years later)! 9.8 Merc in the boat house... beaten as a rental, came with the camp and still runs. My 275 Verado hasn't skipped a beat nor has the 9.9 pro kicker in 6 years. Same deal with my Honda 25... probably the same deal with your Yamaha. They all have horror stories, most caused by the owner.. not the brand."

779352,kickingfrog,2013-04-12 22:47:00,8333,Valid points. Suggesting that quality is based on sales is not.
779353,irishfield,2013-04-12 23:01:00,26272,Exactly Rob... there's lemons in every batch.  Rizz... you made a great choice.. run with it.  Someone once said.. once you go black..... but that might have been a female... LOL
779405,bigbuck,2013-04-13 03:27:00,2449,Hurry up and order it already. Get it rigged in time for musky opener and we want pics of the nice beautiful slime making a mess of your shiny new boat. You will not regret going with the bigger motor. Alumacraft makes a nice hull with nice layouts. Good luck with it.
779408,moxie,2013-04-13 04:05:00,1566,Congratulations!!!! Enjoy.  I hear ya Dave but I just hold Merc to the same level as I do GM and it ain't one of esteem. Its' personal.  X2.  Agreed there are good and bad in every batch but I have always admired the Japanese for making it that much better.  I'm jealous. Hope it sees a lot of slime.
779438,hirk,2013-04-13 13:04:00,571,"Guys I wasnt trying to imply that mercs are better than yammies therefore they sell more only that they make a good product. The perception that yammies are more reliable and ""better"" would not likely be proved out if you could compare defects per 1000 units to compare apples to apples. Yes you hear of fewer problems with the yammies but thats to be expected given there are far more mercs in service. I would guess they all would rate close for defect rates and that there is little if any difference between various brands in reliability. They all make a good product and they all  blow up."

778711,moxie,2013-04-10 09:57:00,1566,lmao!!! decision ain't gettin any easier is it?
778723,Radnine,2013-04-10 11:08:00,1538,"What about inside storage or layout? Can you see the instruments, or is the steering wheel in the way? Which one uses space better? Which one can you see yourself sitting in for the next 15 years or so? Which one matches your car better?  You are talking about two riveted boats with brand new motors. Both will serve well and both motors will likely start when you turn the key for years to come. In other words, if I were to put this in terms of bicycles, you are looking at a Trek and a Giant. Both just frames with different names, with Shimano gears and Rock shock forks. You will enjoy riding both, and the actual difference is minuscule.  Make a pro and con list and buy the boat that ticks off more of your ""pro"" boxes. Then quit looking, and quit asking. Jim"
778736,Fish Farmer,2013-04-10 12:17:00,2234,"Myself Rizzo, I liked the Navigator because of the big livewell and with a Yamaha. Problem now there making boats with this stupid rod locker down the middle of the boat and making these small livewells you can only put a couple small fish in. Myself, a big livewell is great for fish recovery, Tournaments, and a fish cooler. Like, how many rod storage places do you need. I even see there putting bigger livewells in the stern, there is enough weight in the back of the boat now with motor, batteries, fuel, etc. The amount of money you pay for a boat, they should have livewell options. I'd like to see them put a big muskie, pike, Salmon in those dink livewells."
778748,lew,2013-04-10 12:39:00,12766," I usually just do a shore lunch with the big muskies Dave, then there's no need for a live well"
778751,ecmilley,2013-04-10 12:48:00,2163,"well i still think the smoker's are better built boats, now if you could get the yammy 70.. so i can post a link to each to compare. http://www.alumacraft.com/competitor-165-sport.php http://www.smokercraft.com/showroom/fishing-boats/pro-angler/162-xl"
778758,Sinker,2013-04-10 13:14:00,8692,"If it were me, I'd be looking at the tiller models. Look at all that space!! Way nicer to fish from! Probably cheaper too.  Another thing to check out is where things will be mounted, and how hard will it be to install. Things like rod holders, graphs, GPS etc. My buddies boat was a gong show to install tracks/rod holders, but others were a breeze.  Bottom line is they're both good boats.  S."
778759,ecmilley,2013-04-10 13:20:00,2163,"oh no tiller debate! yeah for sure the tiller offers way more fishability and space, downfall is no protection from elements , my choice would be a tiller boat if available"
778774,Sinker,2013-04-10 14:18:00,8692,"I have enough quality outer wear to protect me from the elements anyways! I'm sure even the console guys have good outer wear.  A buddy of mine has a much bigger console boat than me, but we always fish from my tiller. Soooo much more room. I feel cramped in a console.  S."
778776,JoshS,2013-04-10 14:45:00,729,"I'm no expert but I've looked at both and I don't think you can go wrong with either. I know how it is.. making the final call can be tough! Personally, I like the Alumacraft better and the extra 7in might be nice considering the big full windshield!  On that note, I think my next boat will be a tiller. I have a wide single console now, however sat in a few tillers and I gotta say the fishability and room is awesome."
778785,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-10 15:02:00,455,alumacraft/yamaha vote for me. sounds like an awesome rig
778789,Loonietoon,2013-04-10 15:09:00,1450,"If Clarence is not selling them anymore, there is a place in Sutton  that is selling them, seen them at the show.. Powersport Depot PM me if you want phone #"
778834,SlowPoke,2013-04-10 19:09:00,2984,"Alumacraft now eh? That boat sounds familer!  Food for thought.... The Aluma is a new/old stock unit and the $500 difference may be negotiable especially if they're getting away from the brand.  You're unlike to incur warranty issues on a boat of that quality and Bay City can still be your shop for motor service and repair.  Pay close attention to items included in the deal(s) especially where number of seats, tops/covers are concerned. Post sale or custom work can cost a fortune. My Starcraft came with a bimini, side windows, full clear camper back, clear rear drop curtain and zip in clear windshield extension. The zip in windshield extension is awesome. It converts the bimini into a full top. Most boats come with a full top and you need a seperate bimini. The Smokercraft might have this as well.  As mentioned previously, layout should make your mind up. Is the 3 seat configuration in the Smoker okay or do you prefer the 4 seater Aluma?  Does one have a better dash layout to accommodate a suitable sonar/gps combo?  My boat has a huge glove box and I never gave it much thought when buying but its great for lots of dry storage for clothing, gear, lunches etc.  Are either boats pre-wired for bow mount trolling motor and batteries? You can run up a big bill to properly equip afterwards.  Rod holder mounting options?  Motor rebates or warranty promotions?  Spare tire, swing tongue, LED lights, transom tie-downs, trailer brakes included on either?  There's a bunch of things for you to consider to sway you one way or another."
778863,mikeh,2013-04-10 21:43:00,824,can you convert the 70 hp to a 90 with a change done on the computer of the motor. I think some 75 hp were could be changed to 90 for $300 after upgrades to the computer chip.anybody know if this is true.
778866,landry,2013-04-10 22:01:00,1005,This is good advice on both cost and alumacraft weight IMO.
778870,BillM,2013-04-10 22:29:00,17367, So buy a new motor and void your warranty right off the bat?   That doesn't seem very smart.
778882,hirk,2013-04-10 23:40:00,571,"Allumacraft all the way if i was choosing between them as long as they both had the layout i wanted. Lund and Allumacraft are the top tin boats made as far as quality, i wouldnt worry about being under powered due to its higher rating because these boats will perform about the same with a 70 due to the weights being the same. Like mentioned its the motor you want to worry about for warranty/service, the boat could be fixed under warranty at a manufacturers approved repair center like Grumpy's no need to return it to the selling dealer. Its hard enough finding a dealer to service a yammy never mind a suzuki and then there is the parts issue so for that reason alone I would pass."
778883,Slimeball,2013-04-10 23:40:00,30,"A couple things you should also be considering.  1. Resale value. If and when it comes time to sell you're boat, you'll be glad you went with Alumacraft. I'm not saying Smoker is not a quality aluminum boat, but their reputation is not up to par with Alumacraft.  2, No doubt the Suzuki is a nice outboard but their dealer network is small. Meaning if you plan to take you're rig to Northern Ontario,Quebec,Manitoba, or the States and something goes wrong there's a better chance that there will be a Yamaha dealer close by. With a Suzie you'll most likely be SOL.  Good luck with whatever you choose!"
778894,Fish Farmer,2013-04-11 00:33:00,2234,I'll stick to Perch Lew. Have you ever eaten a Muskie Lew? I know you've caught 100's. Just the smell of them would turn me off eatin one.
778901,Rizzo,2013-04-11 01:13:00,4754,"thanks so much everyone. Looks like I will go with the aluma as it seems to be the choice of the majority. Looks like I'll even splurge and do the 90 (even though I said I wouldn't). I just hated the idea of possibly being underpowered. Scraped up a few more $ and lets do it right, without regrets"
778905,Slimeball,2013-04-11 01:41:00,30,You'll be very happy you went with the 90...
778920,ctered,2013-04-11 02:50:00,40,The Alumacraft will be a much better boat. As far as width goes it is only 4 inches narrower at the max but is 3 inches wider at the transom. In other words the smokercraft flares out at the console and then tapers at the transom. The longer hull will ride better in rough water and I agree that the Yamaha is a much better motor and there are more dealers for service.
778948,ecmilley,2013-04-11 11:50:00,2163,"well you been talked into upgrading this far, may as well go get a lund pro-v or  predator and keep it forever"
778956,RickOnt,2013-04-11 12:22:00,669,Leatherdale Maine in Orillia is an Alumacraft dealer.  Then you could get an E-Tech

778562,Rizzo,2013-04-09 20:12:00,4754,"Thanks to all who have given advice on my other questions, helped me decide on Smoker Craft instead of Lowe, and Suzuki instead of Merc. Was just about to buy the Smoker...and then went to Bay Cty Marine and saw an Alumacraft Competitor 165 Sport with a 70 hp Yamaha. Now just some background - want it to fit in garage which both of these will. Both have full windshield that I also want. The smoker is a bit wider (4 inches) but the Alumacraft a bit longer (8 inches I think) The Smoker is a real sweet looking boat on a sharp looking trailer that will be close to max hp (a 70 suzuki on a max 75 boat).  The alumacraft is new as well but from 2012, less flashy in appearance, but  looks to be built like a tank (did not see the trailer). It has a 70 Yamaha (also new but 2012) on it but the boat maxes out at 90. Upgrading to the 90 is not an option for financial reasons so I'd be around 80% of max. The 2012 alumacraft/yami is $500 dollars more than the 2013 Smoker/Suzuki. For the most part the boat will be used for fishing on St Clair, me and one other guy. Possibly a little bit of ""gentle"" tubing - my kids are young and not very courageous. Thanks in advance to anyone who gives advice or opinions, after this I'm buying one of them!"
778563,ecmilley,2013-04-09 20:19:00,2163,"go with the suke/smoker combo getting better bang for your buck the alumacraft while decent boat are built extra heavy look at the double flooring ect so unless you can equip it to max hp it will be a performance ""letdown"" compared to other 70-75hp class boats"
778573,trevy727,2013-04-09 20:39:00,351,I vote alumacraft and yammie.
778574,Cosmos,2013-04-09 20:43:00,588,Second for alumacraft and Yamaha.
778589,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-09 21:37:00,4399,I owned a Alumacraft Navigator with a 90 Yamaha and was happy with both and wish I never sold the rig!  I don`t think you will regret the Alumacraft/Yamaha combo.
778595,Sinker,2013-04-09 22:05:00,8692,"I'm kinda liking the alumacrafts, although I've never ran one, or fished from one.  You'd be happy with either rig I'm sure. Layout would be the deal maker for me.  S."
778604,lew,2013-04-09 22:32:00,12766,Alumacraft over Smokercraft & Yamaha over Suzuki  
778609,moxie,2013-04-09 22:36:00,1566,Aluma/Yami. If I wouldn't have found gotten the deal I did on my used Crestie I would have gone with the Alumacraft.
778628,Rizzo,2013-04-09 23:21:00,4754,you guys are killing me! Of course its the more expensive one. Nobody concerned about the 70 hp on a max 90 boat? This is one thing that was concerning me about the alumacraft
778632,irishfield,2013-04-09 23:29:00,26272,Don't worry Roger.. they're all so confident that if you're not happy with it they'll buy it from you at full MSRP!! LOL Decisions decisions... always a tough call no matter the choices in front of you! Good luck with which ever direction you go...
778639,Rizzo,2013-04-09 23:41:00,4754,"well said Wayne! At the price point I'm looking at there will always be something left to desire...hence my difficulty making a decision. The good news is, I like both boats so hopefully happy either way. With the aluma I worry that the 70 might be inadequate, with the Smoker I worry the aluma is the better quality boat!"
778643,Rizzo,2013-04-09 23:58:00,4754,oops and forgot one thing. Can't seem to really find anyone that services alumacraft boats should there be a problem with it. Bay City in Hamilton is no longer carrying them and I can't seem to find anyone else. Anyone know a place that would provide warranteed service on the boat should the need arise?
778644,Terry,2013-04-10 00:08:00,14456,I'm glad I just flipped a coin and bought a boat.......now I have to wait till june till it arrives hello lund
778646,woodenboater,2013-04-10 00:19:00,2277,"Was also at the Cottage show and was liking the Alumacraft side console they had on the floor as well. Anyways, picked up a brochure and the dealer was in Kinmount. A bit of a drive from K-Dub though. Walsten Marine (walstenmarine.com)"
778647,irishfield,2013-04-10 00:24:00,26272,"Issue with all these boat manufacturers...... they are scaring off dealers by continually raising the number of boats / year that you have to ""floor plan"" to be a dealer. Why when the owner of Naden asked me how many boats that I thought a ""dealer"" should have to buy per year to have the ""honour"" of selling the brand I told him ONE ... and it works!"
778655,dhickey,2013-04-10 00:58:00,1038,If it were me in your position I would concentrate on the engine rather than looks or speed? I say that because without a good engine pushing your boat then its all pretty much worthless?  Its a long way from that old cannoe.. Good luck  Don.
778656,kickingfrog,2013-04-10 01:05:00,8333,"""Last debate"" eh? Are you new around here?"
778658,Rizzo,2013-04-10 01:07:00,4754,Salty...and I think thats one thing both boats have going. What I seem to be hearing is that Yamahas are #1 and Suzuki's are a close 2nd
778659,Rizzo,2013-04-10 01:09:00,4754,hahaha Kfrog...I mean last debate for me before I buy. End of the day you can drive yourself nuts looking at choices. Glad I have lots of knowledgeable people here to weigh in
778661,Dan668,2013-04-10 01:22:00,1120,Which boat from Lund?  Id go for the Alumacraft op. That was one of my few choices a few years ago when i was purchasing. Solid boats.
778665,mikeh,2013-04-10 01:31:00,824,are both motors 4 strokes?
778670,Rizzo,2013-04-10 01:35:00,4754,"yup, both are 4's and both are 70 hp"
778690,moxie,2013-04-10 02:07:00,1566,Of course!! You want it to last. if the classic runs 30mph with a 50 E-tec i'm guessing the 70 should run at least mid 30's when loaded. Good luck.
778693,BillM,2013-04-10 02:30:00,17367,Max out the motor if possible.  You don't regret it.
778707,bow slayer,2013-04-10 06:07:00,1074,"i would go with the smoker,for 2 reasons,being closer to max hp the performance and gas mileage should be better....and for me i would take the wider hull over the longer one everytime."
