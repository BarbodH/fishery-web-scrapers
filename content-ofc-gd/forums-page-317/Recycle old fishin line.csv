779228,Scott S,2013-04-12 13:52:00,203,I have a bunch of old fishing line that I would like to get rid of. Does anyone know of any spots that I can take it too. I use to take it to Lou at Simcoe Bait. Thanks Scooter
779241,irishfield,2013-04-12 14:34:00,26272,Stuff in a 2 litre pop bottle and put it out with the blue bin !
779256,Scott S,2013-04-12 15:47:00,203,Really !! It's okay to do that?
779259,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-12 16:11:00,4399,Dont see why not its plastic.
779261,Ralph Field,2013-04-12 16:22:00,1018,No tackle shops in Barrie ?
779269,moxie,2013-04-12 16:54:00,1566,"Awesome wealth of knowledge.    Edit: Forgot the ""E"" in Aw""E""some."
779276,Roy,2013-04-12 17:40:00,13728,"I'll take the ""E"" for 5$, Bob."
779290,irishfield,2013-04-12 18:37:00,26272,It heads it in the right direction at least.. and trust me the crap they're making from reground pop bottles isn't going to be effected by a few ounces of what ever molecular structure of fishing line you're using. Not that I know anything about plastics.....
779294,davey buoy,2013-04-12 18:43:00,5505,"That's a great idea Wayne,I bring mine home and right in the garbage. As you said,it's at least heading in the right direction!"
779295,moxie,2013-04-12 18:49:00,1566,hehehe.  I never even considered it Wayne. A great idea indeed.
779298,SirCranksalot,2013-04-12 18:54:00,3291, It rare that someone is trying to be helpful when they tell you to stuff it!
779299,irishfield,2013-04-12 18:56:00,26272,28 years in the plastics business and definitely not the first time I told someone to stuff it !
