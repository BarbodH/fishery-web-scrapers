778598,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-04-09 22:20:00,0,"I spent the winter working at Mt. Milligan in British Colombia and didn't get out fishing until last weekend.  Sunday morning I packed up my gear and spring fishing clothes and headed north for some fishing.  Apparently spring hasn't quite hit northern Ontario as I'd expected and ended up snowshoeing for 2 hours threw endless powder instead of the spring crust I had hoped to be walking on.  Then when I got to the lake my clothes were soaked and I was frozen for a better part of the day.  The saving point of the day was that we got into some decent specks.  Numbers weren't great but all the fish we caught were decent sized, with an average around 2lbs.  Minus some rookie moves regarding clothing I guess I haven't lost my touch.  Looking forward to open water!"
