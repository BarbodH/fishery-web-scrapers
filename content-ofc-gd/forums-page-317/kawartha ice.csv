778367,Kawartha Kev,2013-04-09 00:56:00,281,Check out the webcam from this resort on Lower Buckhorn where I have a cottage you can see lots of open water in the main channel but still ice in the bays and along the shore. Here's the link  http://www.reachharbour.com/  Kawartha Kev

778419,Big Cliff,2013-04-09 09:24:00,6899,Figure it will be two more weeks before I can put my docks in on Sturgeon Lake.
778437,Christopheraaron,2013-04-09 12:41:00,3525,"went passed scugog 2 days ago, most of it's still locked up but the rivers and most of the south lake are open."
778509,manjo39,2013-04-09 16:47:00,354, I'm crossing my fingers for the April 20th weekend.  Might be wishful thinking considering the forecast includes snow on Thursday and Friday this week.
778511,jimmer,2013-04-09 17:11:00,2730,Where are you located? Different conditions for different lakes. Water level is already starting to come up slightly.
778512,ecmilley,2013-04-09 17:17:00,2163,still solid 8+ inches around my place could walk out and fish if i felt like it
778673,beertech,2013-04-10 01:40:00,118,Thanks for the replys everyone.  Im on pigeon on the backside of big island
778677,beagle dad,2013-04-10 01:48:00,224,could still walk to island this morning   not that I would
778771,jimmer,2013-04-10 13:57:00,2730,"The main lake is still covered, some break up in the lower end, but ice moving around. Gannons Narrows is wide open."
779031,Harrison,2013-04-11 18:19:00,2202, Sawheat!  Shot in the dark here.. but anyone know how Crappie the ice is on Upper Buck towards the locks?
779059,jimmer,2013-04-11 20:21:00,2730,I heard last weekend that is was opening up just south of the narrows. Any areas that have a current should be open soon if not already.
779062,lew,2013-04-11 20:28:00,12766,All of Katchawanooka has been wide open for weeks and when I drove past there a couple hours ago a boat was running across it. Sure was nice to hear the sound of an outboard finally !!
779091,fishindevil,2013-04-11 23:03:00,6254,Gannon's narrows is open a fair ways into buckhorn and yes it's open near the town of buckhorn as well and pigeon is starting to open in the north end near nogies and a good ways out from the river towards big island sturgeon is still mostly frozen but open where the rivers dump in Emily creek is ice free !!!!!!! Can still walk out on sturgeon where I live.   Grrrrrrr it's never gonna leave !!!!!!
