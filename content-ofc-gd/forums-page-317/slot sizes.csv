777812,Sinker,2013-04-05 23:54:00,8692,"I'm still skeptical about the carp thing.  If that were the case, all the lakes would have declined and recovered at the same time, no?  I also don't agree with the wild rice on sturg. I find there is less now than there ever has been. A lot of the small bullrush islands have also disappeared.  Of course anglers catching fish has an impact, its just so small when compared to other environmental impacts. The amount of fish caught and kept is only a drop in the barrel when a whole year class (or 3) go missing. Look at the big picture, there is way more going on than fisherman. I also don't see any more fisherman now than I did 20 years ago....in fact, I'd say less.  Radnine......really? Grow up!  S."

In the last couple of years Sturgeon Lake has started to develop quite a colony of them. 5 years ago you might not even see one all summer, now there are hundreds of them.  I find it really strange that MNR will tell you that if you catch a round gobi to kill it but you can't shoot a cormorant."
777901,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-06 11:18:00,2582,Good point about the Cormorants Cliff. I don't know there impact either but they sure are ruining a few islands on Sturgeon.
777903,Garnet,2013-04-06 11:54:00,2056,I believe this be to the best conversatiom in months on this board.  The walleye didn't bounce back on shear luck on any of these lakes.  Maintaining water levels is huge but just like the carp connection only 1 part. I think it might have been that little bit the walleyes needed.  Bass clubs in this area started in 1996 and I fished a club crappie tournament on Rice Lake were most of the crappie were released on Lake Scugog about 300 (not by me I ate mine) and won the tournament. This was wrong but that's how they the crappie moved around so quickly.
777906,ecmilley,2013-04-06 12:39:00,2163,"I also believe walleye populations exploded in the 50-70's because they were invasive (being stocked) and no real predators untill they were completly acclimated to the kawartha's IMO. otherthings to consider, the lakes has we know them have been around since 1850's or so when dams locks started going in current model of trenst severen is what 1913? with the damning gull, missiasuga, north river and crowe systems. Anyone been noticing the a mount of silt build up in the lakes over the last several years? laydowns i would fish on in goose are buried some of the shoal areas nice fine layer of crud on them, weeds growing in new places different weeds altogether in other, these lakes are changing and evolving at all times."

If you drain approx 8 ft out of the kawarthas that would be as close to as what it was as we can get."
778278,jedimaster,2013-04-08 15:30:00,3472,"IMO, the MnR has the single biggest impact on the fisheries in Ontario. Especially the Kawartha lakes. There research, decisions on stocking/limits/regs and enforcement are what keeps or kills a lake."
778306,jimmer,2013-04-08 19:08:00,2730,Muskie are natural to our lakes. I also believe smallmouth bass to be natural.
777601,Sinker,2013-04-04 23:05:00,8692,"The lakes can sustain a recreational fishery no problem. Its the bigger environmental issues that hurt the populations. A guy catching a limit bears no weight against trent severn wiping out a whole year class of fingerlings....I don't think your understanding my point(s). The sudden invasion of crappies in the lakes feeding on young of the year walleye eat a hell of a lot more than any fisherman will eat in a season. The clearing water and deeper light penetration. Caused by zebra mussels, has changed habitat that will never be the same again. In the long term, the lakes will recover, whether the limit is reduced or not.  I get the point that a fish that has to be released because of the slot is a good thing. Of course it is, but there are much bigger players that have a much more significant impact on the populations besides anglers.  S."
777613,beagle dad,2013-04-04 23:29:00,224,understand what your saying  seems to me that the same attitude surprised the heck out of the people on the east coast of Canada no way can we catch all the cod on the ocean.....got so bad  they put a no fishing law in  tell me if you can overharvest a ocean whats the chances of a lake surviving and yes other factors where involved there as well
777626,Sinker,2013-04-05 00:23:00,8692,"Your comparing apples to oranges with that argument. I grew up on the east coast, and come from a family of inshore fisherman. I know all about the cod fishery. I wouldn't be in ON if there were still fish there. Blame the canadian govt for that one. Even the fisherman were telling them to shut it down long before anything was done. Its hard to blame the fisherman, when their livelihood depends on catching fish, and the govt gave them a ""sustainable"" quota to harvest.  Anyways, its a good discussion, and I do understand your point of view, I just think there are much bigger impacts on the fishery than recreational angling.  S."
777627,Sinker,2013-04-05 00:25:00,8692,"I meant to add that the east coast fishery was sstricly due to over harvest. There were no invasive species, dropped water levels on spawning grounds, or new species introduced.  S."

777636,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-05 00:42:00,2582,I agree with you 100% Shayne. To me overharvest is a none issue for the Kawartha Walleyes.  We caught tons of them for years and years. BUT...just a few short years after crappie started showing up...the walleye numbers take a real big nose dive. I'm not a biologist but it seems pretty obvious to me. Also the Trent Severn has really dropped the ball on maintaining proper water levels for the eggs after the spawn. I am told that they have lost more then a few year classes because of this.  We have a cottage up in Bobcaygeon. I am truly amazed every single year just how few people I actually see the ENTIRE season targeting eyes on Pidgeon or Sturgeon. Most weekends when I am out there I have all kinds of good water ALL to myself. And like I said this is on weekends. If I'm up there for a weeks holidays there is virtually no fishermen on the water through the week.
777674,lickmyarmpit,2013-04-05 03:57:00,359,"Slot sizes are a great idea and should be posted at every major ramp so that everyone is aware of the rules.  As for the kawarthas crappie population I'm hoping them to be cooperative In the next few weeks, and I'll do my part to thin their ranks......"
777681,Big Cliff,2013-04-05 10:11:00,6899,"Well if the crappie are such a big problem then why is there a limit on them? I know how we could do some real damage to the crappie population, just post it no limit on them and we'd have droves of people from Toronto coming up here and hauling buckets full of them home."
777690,Garnet,2013-04-05 11:14:00,2056,All the lakes that have crash came at the very peak of the crappie on that lake and with a no catch Limit. This is a natural thing they quickly drop down in size but the #'s stay very high.  I also don't believe zebra mussels are factor. They peak in the late 90's and every walleye in the system have lived their whole life with Zebra mussels.  So the Question why have the walleye came back.  In the late 90's I was involved in the Kawartha Angler walleye spawning survey on Scugog. It' very important to know trhat walleyes are prodcasters they don't make nest like bass. The female swims slowly around with 2-3 males dropping their eggs over a wide area.  Carp were also following every female walleye that I seen just vacuming up those eggs.  Now you all remember about 10 years ago the great Carp die off. This is what I believe allowed the walleye to come back huge.  Except the Tri Lakes I'm worried and Balsam is just a ticking bomb.
777698,fishindevil,2013-04-05 12:34:00,6254,
777701,Sinker,2013-04-05 12:58:00,8692,"I'm with fishindevil, that doesn't make much sense.  Carp are pretty inactive when the water is only a couple degrees celcius. The walleyes are spawning while the ice is still on the lakes.  Scugog hasn't had zebras since the late 90's either. Maybe the last 6-7 years tops. It was the last lake to get them, the same as crappies. The tri lakes is another story. You have to look at the system lake by lake, they are all different, but they are all being affected the same ways, just at different times. Rice is a prime example. Its already been thru the problems scugog is in now, and has recovered really well.....before the carp die off. The carp theory doesn't add up.  Trent severn has a huge impact on the spawn. Water levels mean everything. If the fish get in and spawn when the water is very high, then the water drops before the eggs hatch, there goes another year class. We've been luck the last few years with steady water levels at spawning time. This could be one of those years where the water is high at spawning, then drops. I hope they hold back as much water as possible, for as long as possible. I'm pretty sure they have made some changes to thier mandate to allow the fish to spawn before playing with water levels. I'd rather have fish in the lakes, than run my boat thru the locks!  The bottom line is that there has been a lot of serious environmental impacts in the last 10 yrs, that have much bigger impacts than angling pressure.  S."
777702,Garnet,2013-04-05 12:59:00,2056,"I have 40 years on the Kawrathas. I know Sturgeon, Balsam, Tri Lakes, Scugog and Rice. I know both walleye and bass on these lake better than almost anybody from angling point of view.  Then I've spend 100's hrs working with MNR on everthing from Lake Ontario cold water creeks to Walleye spawning.  Yes I'm qualified and I use my real name."
777706,Garnet,2013-04-05 13:15:00,2056,Sinker you correct zebra mussel are not a factor on Scugog.  What you need to do is get off the chesterfield and go look at Shoal/shore spawning walleyes. The carp are all over them.  The reason why Scugog took so long to crash is water color.  It was my hope that the walleye fry would be protected from those crappie looking up for easy meal by water color.  Here's something else to think about. My bass club had Jason Burnuz out and talking about all the wild rice on lower Pidgeon. Jason is the Fed. Bio. for Ocean and fishery's. He thinks the rice came back because of the carp die off. Apparently carp love rice. And he was living on the Tri lakes.  Also on Scugog fast water spawning areas are not a factor it's all shoal/shore spawning.
777716,outllaw,2013-04-05 13:59:00,1232,slot size never worked on l.st clair. reality is enviroment change and invasive species.. when zebra mussels changed the lake shifts on species and how to fish them became very prevalent.
777717,Sinker,2013-04-05 14:27:00,8692,"The reason scugog took so long is because its at the end of the chain (or the start, however you want to look at it). The crappies got in there last of all the kawartha lakes, so its the last to crash. Give it a few years, it will come back. The crappie population is already starting to stabilize, and numbers are coming down. If I remember right, the walleye in scugog seemed to disappear at the same time as the carp die off, so I'm still skeptical about the whole carp/walleye relationship.  I know JayB personally, but I'm not sure what the wild rice/carp relationship has to do with slot sizes. I know it produces some great duck hunting  I have never really thought about carp raiding walleye eggs, but it is an interesting theory, and one I am going to research more thoroughly.  This is a great topic, and one I'm passionate about. I enjoy reading the replies. I'm not saying I'm right, and what I say is all fact, but I've spent a lot of times on the kawartha's, lived in the area for the last 25 years. I've even met you personally, Garnet  I've done plenty of work with MNR and local  CA's, and have a pretty good idea whats going on. That said, I'm no fishery biologist. I speak from experience, not training.  S."

I had to look real close most times to see the male just behind  the female, the carp were all over them.  I also believe Rice come back perfectly times the carp die off. I will check some stuff later. Think 1999 was the carp die off. I'm sue somebody will no. Rice has been crasy for 6 years now.

I didn't see carp following the walleye shore spawners on Pigeon when I checked them back in the 90's through KA. I believe that there are many factors that have had a negative impact on walleye numbers, all of them mentioned here, but to say that angling pressure has nothing to do with it, is a huge mistake. I'm hoping that the walleye continue to be elusive due to clearer water and their numbers grow. I just saw too many people keeping their limits of six when there was no slot. It's pretty sad to see stringers over the side of the boat that are full of 4-5 pounders during the few weeks after opening. However, it was legal at the time and people did it. Has anyone caught a walleye out of Chemong lately?"

777759,Garnet,2013-04-05 20:38:00,2056,"So to tie the wild rice into the walleyes #'s.  With the huge re birth of the rice beds on Pidgeon, Goose Bay and even Balsam is a huge return of Carp population just around the corner.  Hope I'm wrong.  Scugog are all shore/shoal spawners. Sturgeon likely has the best fast water spawning. Pidgeon the same 2 good fast water areas. Upper Buckhorn and Chemong are Shoal/shore spawn. UB does have a fast water area most don't no were it is. Rice has 3 that most people know about plus about 50 little creeks that run in the south shore. Most so small you can't even find them. And a real active Shoal/shore spawn.  So it's true all are a little different. Except for Tri Lakes all have recovered to be better than ever. All had major carp die off."
777463,beagle dad,2013-04-04 01:00:00,224,i'm curious on peoples opinions of what they consider the best slot sizes and limits myself i'm a fan of the current slot and limit that is in place on balsam lake
777469,captpierre,2013-04-04 01:25:00,2521,"It puzzles me why Balsam Lake walleyes can't be kept between 37-55cm, and in the rest of the Kawarthas they must be between 35-50cm.  What is the explanation?  Anybody know?  peter"

777474,Sinker,2013-04-04 01:37:00,8692,"I think the plan is to compare noted between the two slots and see which one produces the best natural reproduction.  The only way to do it right is have a different slot on every lake. They are all different.  Trent severn waterways, crappies, and zebra mussles have a much bigger impact than any slots or reduced limits IMO.  S."
777477,Nipfisher,2013-04-04 01:47:00,2449,"I think it would be easier for anglers to have a ""Keep"" slot size. Rather then ""release"" slot size. Lake Nipissing is release all walleye between 40cm and 60cm. So you can keep walleye smaller then 40cm or bigger then 60cm. Why not just keep fish under 50cm and release all walleye bigger then 50cm? Captpierre, Lake Nipissing is 40cm - 60 cm slot size and the rest of Zone 11 is 42cm - 60cm."
777478,Radnine,2013-04-04 01:48:00,1538,I think that the slot size at Rice has done wonders for the walleye population there. Jim
777489,Sinker,2013-04-04 02:11:00,8692,"Its not the slots or reduced limits that brought the eyes bback on rice.....or any of the kawarthas.  Look at the big picture.  Rice was missing 3 or 4 year classes due to trent severn dropping water levels before eggs hatched. At the same time, crappies were fluorishing, and zebra mussels were introduced. The same scenario will play out on all the kawarthas. The tri-lakes will be the next big walleye boom. Scugog is going thru the same decline now that rice did about 8 years ago.....it just took that long to get to that end of the system.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the slot, but don't think for a second it has anything to do with fish populations after only 2 yrs in place. There are much bigger impacts at play here, not fisherman, slots, or limits. The lakes are going through changes, and take time to bounce back from the effects of those changes.    S."

Radnine, I'm not sure if that was a double post or not, but I don't think it was. Explain how a slot that has been in place for two seasons has made any significant impact on the fishery in rice lake? It takes a lot longer than that to see any changes.  Like I said, I'm all for the slot and reduced limits, but it seems to me that you guys are missing the big picture on these lakes.  S."
777504,glen,2013-04-04 06:50:00,2641,The best limit would let a person keep enough fish for a fish fry for his family. Many of my friends will only fish lakes where they can get a feed. The lakes need to be managed to make this happen.
777505,Big Cliff,2013-04-04 09:41:00,6899,I think that the slot on Sturgeon Lake is perfect! All I ever want to keep is a few small ones for the table. I always released anything 3 lbs or over before the slot was put in place anyway.
777514,BillM,2013-04-04 13:10:00,17367, I hope none of your 'friends' fish the same water I do.

777520,mike rousseau,2013-04-04 14:53:00,4661,"I just find it strange how many different slots there are...  Like here... In NY state you can only keep walleye over 18""  Ontario zone 20 ...4 fish no more then 1 over 24""... But st Lawrence is an exception with no size limit....  Quebec is like 15-21"" you can keep....  And that's for the same body of water... I would think the 3 different guidelines six cancel each other out...."

777553,jimmer,2013-04-04 19:08:00,2730,"I think the top end of the slot in the kawarthas, other than Balsam, should be reduced slightly, maybe down to 19""."
777555,Harrison,2013-04-04 19:21:00,2202,"I agree with sinker.... to add.. I believe the Crappie have a say in it as well.  Trilakes will boom again and soon Shayne, possibly this year!"
777556,Sinker,2013-04-04 19:24:00,8692,"All the kawartha's will boom again. It takes time to adjust to these changes, but the lakes are very productive, and will overcome the changes. Its already happening if you watch closely.  S."
777559,Garnet,2013-04-04 20:00:00,2056,Balsam Lake is in grave danger because of the slot. In the 1st place Balsam never needed a slot.  Before the slot you could catch every size walleye from 10 inchs to 9 lbs and lot's  The danger  is all the gaint walleye are gone. They hit that over slot and they are harvsted and the gaints have got smaller and smaller.  Now a gaint is 6 lb they will be gone in a few years. And then the clock starts ticking 3-4 bad spawns and it will be un recoverable.  Even today if Balsam was changed to the Kawratha Lakes slot the lake would be hammered until it crashed.
777578,Radnine,2013-04-04 21:38:00,1538," It was a double post, but it was on purpose. I think that the minute a slot size is brought in that makes someone throw back a fish that they might have otherwise kept, it is helping the lake. In other words the minute I land a 20"" fish that I might not have landed before the slot because someone kept it, the slot size has helped me. You are clearly educated in the way of fish, but that point somehow eluded you. Jim"
777580,Radnine,2013-04-04 21:49:00,1538," There is a guy on Big Doe Lake near Burke's Falls that is on the lake every day (the guy in the small pontoon boat). He is always out there as he lives right across the road from the lake. I don't know if he eats his four walleye a day or not, or if he has a freezer full (which would be a no-no) but he is out there catching fish every freaking day, and keeping fish every freaking day. How many fish has he (or someone that has fished Nipissing everyday for 20 years) taken out of that lake? Jim"
