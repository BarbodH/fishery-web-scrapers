778884,FishAbout,2013-04-10 23:43:00,106,How many people are going? I would look at mobynick charters. He is also out of port credit. He is one of the best on lake ontario. I fish against him in salmon tournaments. Last year he won the overall king of the lake salmon series.
778896,dave524,2013-04-11 00:41:00,4508,Mid May .... I'd be going out of one of the south shore ports still.
778906,bluesky1713,2013-04-11 01:41:00,107,"Probably about 4 or 5 of us.   You have any recommendations for a charter out of the south shore, Dave?"

778919,BillM,2013-04-11 02:48:00,17367,Talk to Ryan over at We Pound 'Em.. Board member and over all great guy..  I'm fairly certain they fish the southern Lake O shore in the spring.. That's where you'll want to be in May!
778927,FishAbout,2013-04-11 03:17:00,106,"Mobynick charters is also on the south shore in spring.  Wepoundem with ryan is good also.  I would go with either one of them.  If you go with 5 people you need to look for a bigger charter boat, which ryan and nick have."
