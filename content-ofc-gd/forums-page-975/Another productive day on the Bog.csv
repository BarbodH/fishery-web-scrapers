And my first fish on my new rod/reel. Shimano Spirex reel and Schimitar rod. $95...pretty good setup for the price.    We managed to get into a lot of large perch. Took several home for the frying pan.      We managed to catch bass in all types of cover. Flats, pads, heavy slop. Lures of choice were small spinner baits and Texas rigged plastics. Here is Curt with his PB largie that hit 3lbs on the scale.            Alot of fish were slamming the baits but couldn't get them to commit on the hookset.  Near the end of the day, we hit a spot that always seems to hold bass/pickeral/muskie....and sure enough....    Overall not a bad day..gonna be having a fish fry today.  Cheers."
