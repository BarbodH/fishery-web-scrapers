242103,Woodsman,2008-08-21 22:59:00,1286,I'm looking for recommendations for a campground reasonably close to the southern part of Mississauga. Looking for a site for a tent for 5-6 Sep. 08 while attending a course at St. John Ambulance in Mississauga. Reasonably quiet with toilets & shower will meet my needs.  Thanks: Rick
