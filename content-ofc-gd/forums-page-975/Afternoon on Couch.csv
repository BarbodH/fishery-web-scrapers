242506,Cudz,2008-08-23 01:11:00,2652,"After a rather average morning on Simcoe I decided to go through the narrows and fish Lake Couchiching.  I did not get over there until about 1 pm so it was rather warm (beautiful day).  I was going to fish the pads and reeds for buckets but decided to try and hit up some smallies instead.  I started drop shotting and as soon as my bait got near the bottom I would get a bite.  I could not keep the perch off the lure so I just went with it.  Honestly I have never had so many hits in such a little bit of time.  I probably caught 50 perch in 2 hours and had about 150 hits (albeit some very small bites).  Crazy.  Great place to take kids.  Caught 3 perch of 12""  and one 12.5"".  I kept a total of nine fish.  Only 2 had parasites.  Not bad. What a great day to be on the water.  Catching some decent perch was a bonus. Here is a pic. "
242507,Clampet,2008-08-23 01:12:00,1947,No small feat considering from a'couch'!
242508,Cudz,2008-08-23 01:14:00,2652, Yep.  I got skills.  didn't leave my den. lol
242510,bigugli,2008-08-23 01:27:00,6138,"How'd you manage to get any real fishing done with all the BASS guys zipping all over the place pre-fishing for the OBF tourny? I was telling the son and his club mates to try the humps on Couch. as a back up plan.  BTW, Nice perch."
242511,mattyk,2008-08-23 01:29:00,2110,some nice looking jumbos!
242512,medmart,2008-08-23 01:29:00,587,Nice perch they will make a good dinner  Rob
242518,Cudz,2008-08-23 02:10:00,2652,Yeah they were out in force.  They have some nice boats.  Although I am not a pro Bass fisherman I am sure many of them envied my boat/motor combo. 1960 12' aluminum (very tippy and very leaky) 6hp (max speed 10 mph)
242520,jwl,2008-08-23 02:34:00,1056," hey don't knock that..my ""semi retired"" old 12 footer that the kids now use for a row boat has seen more fish than you can shake a stick at over the years...well don't shake the stick too hard it's also leaky and very tippy  ...ya don't need a $60,000 Ranger to cathc fish that's for sure."
242523,Wild,2008-08-23 02:52:00,704,Well then ever think of unbolting the couch from the boat and get another 5 mph? So Cudz how tasty were the perch?
242558,Leecher,2008-08-23 12:28:00,7832,Good looking perch Cudz  When the bite is on....it's loads of fun catching pan fish!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
242566,Greencoachdog,2008-08-23 12:59:00,8163,Those are 2 very nice Perch!!!
242652,Zubris21,2008-08-23 22:00:00,563,"Beauties, there's not much that can compete with a good perch fry!"
242782,Smokey,2008-08-24 12:02:00,1278,"Congrats on the fish, hope you enjoyed the meal. Thanks"
