242424,bigugli,2008-08-22 19:03:00,6138,"Some of you already have the misfortune of knowing me  I am a self confessed fishing junkie. I love to fish, awake or asleep.  I eat fish, read fish, wear fish, and , as the wife likes to remind me constantly, smell like fish. In spare time my son and I make tackle.  I'm not one of them species specific types but I do like fishing ultralight and pannies.  Don't much care for the bickering and bull that goes on,   just interested in my 100 days a year on the  water.  Hope to share some fun"
