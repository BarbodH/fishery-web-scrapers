242540,jwl,2008-08-23 04:38:00,1056,question is...what kind of fresh water fish that looks like that would actually have teeth like that???
242549,bigugli,2008-08-23 11:14:00,6138," Goldeye, mooneye, smelts...  Odd balls happen in nature all the time.  Whether we like it, or not, genetic mutation is part of the evolutionary process. Pollution may just be speeding up the process. I have caught 2  ""freaks"". One with an extra adipose fin, the other with 2 tails.  Both were suckers."
242574,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-23 13:38:00,25,"This looks like the 'Siamese Pike' I saw on here, (the fact that everyone thinks it's real). I think I'm going to have to agree with 'Mepps', it looks like the fishes mouth is just riped.  Could be fake.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=22005"

241816,ohhenrygsr,2008-08-21 01:23:00,947,"yea it's gross i hope i never see one in our waters or ever again  Mutated fish alarms delegates at northern Alberta water gathering  Days before a conference on water quality began in Fort Chipewyan, Alta., last week, residents say a strange fish with two mouths was found at the nearby lake.  The deformed fish, which residents say children had caught off the dock at Lake Athabasca, has since been turned over to park wardens at Wood Buffalo National Park. Some residents, including officials from the Mikisew Cree First Nation, took photographs of the fish over the weekend.  It was found just days before the Keepers of the Water conference began Friday in Fort Chipewyan. The conference wrapped up on Sunday.  The event brought together western and northern Canadian aboriginal leaders and environmental activists, all of whom expressed concern with the quality of water in the Athabasca River, downstream from oilsands development in Fort McMurray.  ""It's already mutating the animals, the pollution that they're causing. We need to do something quickly,"" Shaylene Wiley, a 16-year-old Mikisew Cree delegate, told CBC News during the weekend gathering.  ""It's scary when you think about it,"" delegate Lionel Lepine added.  ""For me, personally, it does piss me off, you know, knowing that it's not under my control right now. It's the Government of Canada that has the control over it; they have monopoly over our land. But industry â€¦ somehow they got the licence to pollute.""  "
241817,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 01:26:00,8163,It looks decomposed... another hoax?
241818,ccmtcanada,2008-08-21 01:26:00,7971,Wow...that's one UGLY fish.  Another source says it's a goldeye......  http://canadianpress.google.com/article/AL...OA7RvfSXK1_mfzA
241819,BillM,2008-08-21 01:27:00,17367,That doesn't even look like a fresh water fish.
241822,ccmtcanada,2008-08-21 01:31:00,7971, Not a hoax....the news story he quoted is from the CBC....  http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/08/18/chip-fish.html  Here's what a healthy one looks like....  
241823,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 01:38:00,8163,"Yeah, the Bigfoot story was on the national news too..."
241830,highdrifter,2008-08-21 01:50:00,2534,You're right CCMT.  Poor thing.. Image the conditions that fish had to live in.  Strange it lived to be that size.  Guess it's less work with two yappers!  HD

241838,highdrifter,2008-08-21 01:59:00,2534," Not a deformity, but an advantage... so that they may thrive and multiply!!"
241840,ccmtcanada,2008-08-21 02:06:00,7971, LOL...true enough Glen.
241841,mbac31,2008-08-21 02:07:00,904,This kind of thing happens in nature all the time. Same as humans. Extra toe or missing a limb. It just happens. People get to worked up over stuff like this. There is no real proof that it was caused by pollution yet but they are quick to pass judgement on the Government etc before any conclusive evidence.
241842,Burtess,2008-08-21 02:08:00,901,"Doesn't look too abnormal to me, just like a rotten fish with part of its lower jaw torn up and hanging down, could be its tongue with the teeth on it.  Sound like Bull to me...  Burt"
241856,Nemo,2008-08-21 02:59:00,727,"Can't really see the mouth(es) but it looks to me like it is something that was eaten tail first and patially digested then regurgitated....hmm pass the batter.  Only way to confirm the mutation would be to analyze the DNA.  The Oil Sands is a major polluter, even more so than regular oil operations.  Interesting article here Oil Sands Article"
241857,Greencoachdog,2008-08-21 03:02:00,8163,  Oh man!... this is just too weird!!!    ... Burtess and GCD on the same side of the fence???
241862,hammercarp,2008-08-21 03:19:00,964,I think it's a hoax. It does look like a half digested fish and the tongue has dropped down through the thin membranes at the base of the gills . Even if it's not a hoax these freaks of nature are rare but we see them from time to time.
241865,Beats,2008-08-21 03:28:00,543,"I always find it weird when these kinds of things come up and there is only a single picture to look at...  If you came across a mutant fish or a bigfoot, or whatever that is obviously going to get people talking, wouldn't you take a few more pictures???  Different angles, or something.  Give people a little more to go on.  Happens all the time it seems.  One pic."
241866,holdfast,2008-08-21 03:33:00,1813,By any chance would this have anything to do with Mr Dress ups Green platform.  The CBC is Pro Liberal if you didnt know
241868,solopaddler,2008-08-21 03:38:00,8605,"Seems like too much of a coincidence that it was found on the eve of the conference...  Still, if it is a hoax it was likely done to draw attention to the problem and their motives were probably good."
241870,limeyangler,2008-08-21 03:42:00,5204,more chance of catching it with 2 mouths...no need for a stinger hook...lol....but seriously..if thats not a hoax its pretty disturbing.
241871,BabyHerc,2008-08-21 03:43:00,285, That was my first thought too.  Almost all fish have a set of teeth of some sort on their tongue in the middle pf the mouth.  This pic looks as if the softer skin in the middle of the lower jaw has separated or torn from the rest of the jaw.
241876,mepps,2008-08-21 03:58:00,1301,I call Bull on this one. Its just like that trout from last year that they said had two mouths but it really just had a torn mouth (most likely from being ona a stringer)  
241885,snag,2008-08-21 05:29:00,1932,LIKE I NEED ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED!
241897,modny,2008-08-21 10:53:00,502,put it this way..  if there is one   there are more.   lets get a stringer of em and have a shore lunch  BOO YAAA

241934,DANIMAL,2008-08-21 13:54:00,215,Looks to me like someone took the jaw off another fish and stuck it through the gills of this one.
