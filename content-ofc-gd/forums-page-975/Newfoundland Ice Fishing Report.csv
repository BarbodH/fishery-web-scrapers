242365,Cookslav,2008-08-22 16:26:00,1457,better late then never!  Wow they are dark colored eh?
242369,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-22 16:37:00,0,Building a fire on ice. Never seen that one before.   Is that how you make the hole to fish?   Cuz I cant see any fishing hole!
242374,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 16:49:00,7971,"If the ice is thick enough then what happens is the fire will melt off a layer of ice at the top, but then once you get down a few inches, it'll actually re-freeze.  Heat rises so it's not trapped and melt all the way to water."
242375,nancur373,2008-08-22 16:51:00,1211,Always make fire on ice if only going to be there for a few hours. It was cold that day too. we had 4 holes going. Only one beside us. You can see the wood stick to the bottom right side of the first pic and you can see one by the ski-doo in the third. In the 6th pic you can see the hole right between the fire and the track of the ski-doo
242376,nancur373,2008-08-22 16:53:00,1211,"The look like smelts but they're actually capelin. Salted, dried, and just heat up on the fire."
242477,FinS,2008-08-22 22:18:00,463,those smelt sure look tasty
242482,ch312,2008-08-22 22:37:00,1590,ive been to the rock twice. fished for pretty much everything in the ocean but the land locked brookies were fun to catch. ill never forget going after the sea run brookies in the one pond. there was a small stream coming into it and there was a pool about 12ft x 5ft that was literally black there were so many trout in there. the sea run trout are much more silver looking than the ones in the pics but taste just as great
242487,pokerdemon4,2008-08-22 22:54:00,135,Why did you have to post this?  Just joking.  Im so home sick now.  Looks like a great time.  Great post and pics.  No place like the rock.  Too bad we can't live there.
