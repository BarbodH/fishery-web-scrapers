Of the four of them, one father/son pair had fished 1 time, and it was in the ocean.  So for a four hour charter, I was kind of nervous.  Everyone picked up the casting pretty quick, which was a welcome surprise.  I gave everyone simple baits to use ... ie. spinnerbaits, senkos, wacky worm.  One dad caught 4 bass and 1 pike, his son caught 2 bass, the other dad skunked, but he spent most of his time helping his 8 year old son who managed 3 bass.  For a four hour trip, with no experience, I was happy with the results, but I was itching to get into some fish.  I went back to fish some of the same areas with jigs and other ""not so simple"" baits.  In 3 hours I landed 9 bass, one was a 4+ ... cant go wrong, I was happy with the day!        And some of my fish after the charter ended.... I had to put my camera on a timer on top of my motor .... kinda nervous about it hahaha    "
