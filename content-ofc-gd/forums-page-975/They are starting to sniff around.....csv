242500,Burtess,2008-08-23 00:16:00,901," I used a stale, full sized marshmallow on each point of the treble of the spoon   Lets hope it happens again and again....   I do the same thing, zoom in on the cement to see if it looks familiar lol..   It looks quite dark in the pic but that may be the flash playing tricks at night.  It was not really that dark as in the pic...  Burt"
