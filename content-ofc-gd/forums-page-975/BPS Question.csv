242315,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-22 14:44:00,0,Can you get a fishing license at BPS or Canadian Tire??
242317,Roy,2008-08-22 14:46:00,13728,You can get them at both Johnny.  Edit: 'Bout time you got one too eh Johnny?
242318,Canuck2fan,2008-08-22 14:58:00,1444,I don't know about BPS but NO CANADIAN TIRE near where I am sells them anymore. They stopped about 5yrs ago or more for some undefined reason.
242320,jwl,2008-08-22 15:07:00,1056,I get mine at Crappy Tire every year since you needed one
242321,Reef Runner,2008-08-22 15:10:00,980,Select Candian Tire Stores have them JohnnyBass. I usually pick mine up from them and got one with a friend there this year.  Call ahead and ask.
242326,limeyangler,2008-08-22 15:17:00,5204,i need a licence??!!!!
242339,ricoboxing,2008-08-22 15:34:00,398,u can get one online too
242366,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-22 16:30:00,0,Thanks guys. Mine is renewed annually by phone. This is for some one else. Will give CT a call since it is a little closer.
242422,GBW,2008-08-22 19:02:00,8460,make sure that they give you the corret one!  My brother-in-law was given the wrong one in Barrie... oh yeah and the online way sucks!  you have to keep the printout with you and the card too at all times.  so have your buddy print 10 or so (if you do the online way) as paper and water don't play well wit eachother.
242455,Carp,2008-08-22 20:16:00,1488," Just fold up the paper and keep it in a small zip lock bag. Put it in the boat, tackle box, etc. I did this after printing the online temporary renewal. My card came super quick. I think it was about a week."
242459,GBW,2008-08-22 20:34:00,8460,but you must have needed a new card.  if you do not need a new card and just a new sticker then all you have is the paper as they will not mail anything to you.
