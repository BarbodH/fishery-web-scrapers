I am going fishing/camping for 6 days in a tent to Restoule and will not have any electricity to re-charge the battery. Just want to see how long the battery will last . thanks."
242419,cpguy29,2008-08-22 18:56:00,148,"Well it certainly wont last 6 days, I would say 3 tops if your fishing hardcore."
242421,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 19:00:00,7971,"Depends on what speed you will be using it on.  I just spent 4 days fishing----probably used the trolling motor 3 to 4 hours a day on the lowest and second to lower setting and it lasted the entire time.  When I got home to recharge it, it still had 1/3 the charge in it.  Bring a fully charged spare battery if you can to be safe."
