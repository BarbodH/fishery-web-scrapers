243066,mistaredone,2008-08-25 02:06:00,913,Heading out to balsam with some buddys for two days of muskie hunting.   Thinking of Balsam Lake Trailer Park & Marina or renting from rosedale and camping else where.  Any suggestions on camping/boat rentals?  Never fished this lake befor but from looking at the map I figured weed spend the two days getting to know the north east side.  Am I better off in a different GENERAL area?  Any sugestions would be appeciated.  Thanks
