242909,Greencoachdog,2008-08-24 18:33:00,8163,I personally like the 30 lb. test 6 lb. diameter Spiderwire... but that's just me.
242918,Leecher,2008-08-24 18:38:00,7832,I'm using Power Pro 20Lbs test on my spinning reels and love it.  It's real smooth casting and tough.  Havent used the other two and cannot comment on them but satisfied with it.  I used to use mono and will never go back.  Hope this helps in your choice of braid.  Leechman
242941,mepps,2008-08-24 19:27:00,1301,"I'd say Power pro first, then Spiderwire, then Fireline.  I'ave had nothing but good experiences with Powerpro, I cant say the same for Fireline although I'm sure many people love it."
242943,salmon,2008-08-24 19:31:00,334,Hi A lot of power pro users on this board. I still use one reel that has Power pro on it.  But I find that Sufix Perf. Braid to be a performing line.  Jose
242950,danbo,2008-08-24 20:38:00,2646,I prefer mono for streams. Braids for spinnerbaits & jigs in weeds/wood. Mono for topwaters.
242954,Mr. Follow,2008-08-24 20:57:00,34,In My opinion they are all good it's just personal preference to which line you like. I personally use Power pro for all my reels from 20 lb to 100lb. I like the feel of the line and how the line wears over time in comparison with other lines.
242966,Rich,2008-08-24 21:33:00,3927,Spiderwire Stealth is my fav braid. I find it just stays tougher longer than Power Pro. To each his own though.
242968,mattyk,2008-08-24 21:37:00,2110,i like power pro myself. I have it both on my spinning and baitcasting reels.
242990,bassjnkie,2008-08-24 23:04:00,1101,"I love Power Pro. BUT, depends for what? Rivers & topwater I second mono. For all else I use power pro."
243070,Cudz,2008-08-25 02:09:00,2652,I like 30 lb power pro or fireline.  I have the 20lb fireline crystal on one rod and it works well.  I fish simcoe alot so I rarely fish braid there.  Mono there.
243090,Mike the Pike,2008-08-25 02:33:00,3421,I use power pro on some rods if you want superior quality buy some Stren Super Braid it does not get that many mentions on this board but it is high quality line and keeps its colour compaired to powerpro.Lasts a long time.  MTP
