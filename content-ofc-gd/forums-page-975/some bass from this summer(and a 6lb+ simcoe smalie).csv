242098,snagmaster,2008-08-21 22:47:00,250,Hey guys havent posted that much this summer because ive been busy with work.....Thought I would put up a post of a few of the bass in the boat this summer. My gorgeous GF sabrina rented a cottage for us for my bday this summer at buckhorn. We had a blast. Fishing was tough but my GF managed to kick my butt. The first night we fished some lillys and instead of tanning snagmastersab decided to cast around....she smoked 3 largies in a row on a gambler shad...I was impressed and a little turned on.lol....catch of my life close to 3 lbs  fish#2  fish#3  The next two days the fishing was tough with high winds....was working a shoreline with a flippin jig and saw something in the water from far...when i got gloser I saw it was a sunken boat...tossed my jig at it and got this nice 3lber  the sunken boat  got some other fish and one walleye but nothing with real size...   the next few pics are from the bancroft area....went up for a weekend with my buds...got into some fish but lost two hogs...my bud managed to get the biggest fish...a largie just over 5lbs on a jig and pig...heres a few fish...cold front and rain made thing tough. tubes were the ticket     decided to hit simcoe last night but had no one to go with so went solo....lol....fished for 3 hours....saw lots of fish but also saw about a million cray fish...so they were very well fed and hard to get a taker...managed to land one and lost one...but it was a good one just over 6lbs....caught it in 14fow....had to set up my camera phone cause i forgot my camera....was just under 22 inches...needless to say it made up for the slow bite.   sorry for the crappy quality...thats my new PB smallie...beats my 6lb smallie from last year.....Plan on fishing like crazy this week...got to get out the as much as I can before school starts...thanks for reading and goodluck on the water.
