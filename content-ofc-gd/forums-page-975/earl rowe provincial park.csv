I grew up near by but never fished there.  can any one tell me what species there are to target and how to target them?   Are you willing to share any special hot spots?  Thanks,   James"

242600,Wild,2008-08-23 15:24:00,704,Are they stocking the pond well? Haven't been there in ages myself and never caught a bow but it was fun just the same.
