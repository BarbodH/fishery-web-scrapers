242319,Leecher,2008-08-22 15:01:00,7832,WOW....Great looking monster buck.....The rack on this beast is unbelievable  Cant wait for the score results from Boone and Crockett....That rack should score big in the non typical catagorie.  Thanks for sharing Leechman
242357,Jen,2008-08-22 16:11:00,833,It seems the deer coming out of Ohio are top notch when it comes to racks.  A buddy sent me this picture which he said was taken on the side of the highway in Southern Ohio...  Now wouldn't he be nice on the wall???    Cheers Jen
242392,oxcowboy,2008-08-22 17:55:00,544,"jen, your buddy is wrong, that buck was killed opening day of bow season 2 years ago by an amish man that lives about 10 miles from my house.  its been named the ""amish buck""  i think its the # 2 biggest bowkilled deer in ohio.  the poor guy cant get anything from it due to his religion, all money goes to the church.    a buck like that would make me change my religion. lol  jason"
