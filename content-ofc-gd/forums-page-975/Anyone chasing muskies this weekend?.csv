242423,MuskieWannabe,2008-08-22 19:03:00,79,I think I'm doing yet another early morning fish for them tomorrow.  Have found a few spots that have been holding muskeis the past few weeks so I'm hoping to see what else is around there.  I've been trolling bucktails with modest success but may start off with a few jakes to see if there are any big girls lurking around.  Good luck to all and hopefully we can swap lies on Monday!  Cheers
