241937,Headhunter,2008-08-21 14:03:00,5703,"Hi folks! Well, after numerous attemps yesterday to get all the pics working, my frustration got the better part of me and I gave up! I had every intention of doing a proper fix today, since I seem to have calmed down, but alas, the best made plans went down the tube! My 6 year old is sick and I'm home with him today... and my report and pics are at work!!! My appologies to all looking forward to the pics... hopefully I'll be back at work Friday and will get the pics up for you! HH"

242143,modny,2008-08-22 01:03:00,502,no pics no read
242260,Bernie,2008-08-22 11:57:00,3190,You didn't mention weather Joe. Seems anytime you come to visit here you bring a rainstorm in the winter or freezing temps in summer. Must have been those other guys. Glad to see you caught some fish too. Honk the horn as you go by?   You could have made it a pit stop here.
242271,Headhunter,2008-08-22 12:44:00,5703,"Hey Bernie! The weather up there for us was great! It rained virtually all day the Saturday we travelled up, pretty much stopped within 1/2 an hour of us arriving and did not rain again until the Thursday afternoon and only for about an hour. Early mornings were a little nippy at 8 and 9 degrees, but the fire box worked great, with a couple of logs to take the morning chill out of the cottage. On the way home, we caught some rain in the Sundridge to Bracebridge run, but other than that, we were looking at ""Simpson's skies"" the whole week. Bernie, I would have stopped by for a quick visit, but with the kids with me, I really had to keep them locked down in the truck. As you know, it's a pretty long drive at 8 1/2 hours for a 4 and 6 year old... I promise next time, we will stop. HH"
242379,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 17:17:00,7971,"Great report!!!  Great write up too!  I found a way to view the pics, so I'll try to post them for you.....looked like you had a ton of fun up there (maybe too much)....LOL.                "
242380,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 17:18:00,7971,"Ok...when I first looked today, the pics in your original post didn't show up....  After I reposted them (Hope you dont mind, I stole them from your filesharing site and uploaded them on my own photobucket account), and came back....all the pics in your original post showed up...  Strange."
242390,Headhunter,2008-08-22 17:46:00,5703,"Thanks Cliff! I have been again struggling with this pic posting thing, but decided to check in again on the board a voila there they are! You sir are a true gentleman (no matter what FnS says! LMAO)! I hope you like the pics... I just noticed that I wear socks too much in the summer... that shot on the beach make me feel like ""Billy white shoes Johnson""! Thanks again Cliff! HH"
242393,ccmtcanada,2008-08-22 17:56:00,7971,"No problem!  I was waiting to comment on the thread until the pics were up....when I saw they still weren't showing up I thought I'd mess around a bit.  Looked like a great time....oh yeah...if it's not a sock tan, then it's a sandal/croc tan instead.....6 of one half dozen of the other I suppose....hehe."

242398,modny,2008-08-22 18:15:00,502,"wow vacationing with jacques cousto thats wicked  looks like a fun time  now that i think of it, i've never caught a smallie in my whole life"
242406,Leecher,2008-08-22 18:35:00,7832,Great report and pics HH  Looks like you guys had a fun time out there and good size walleye!!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
242433,Terry,2008-08-22 19:30:00,14456,yes the pictures add to the post...nice stuff but according to one picture  you can catch walleye.......
242439,Bernie,2008-08-22 19:52:00,3190,"Sorry....I just stopped laughing at your white shoes. The pictures tell the tale Joe. It looks like you and your family had a great time.  Terry, I seen him catch a pickerel before. "
242463,fishnsled,2008-08-22 20:45:00,3520,"The pics are great Joe, looks like a fantastic time."
242516,Wendel,2008-08-23 01:57:00,213,"Glad you had a great time Joe. We didn't get as many fish as we had in years past, but I knew it must have been a fluke.  It was tough fishing in Mid July. That slide is awesome for the kids.  Were the bugs bad(the horseflys were relentless some days at the slide!)"
242586,Headhunter,2008-08-23 14:39:00,5703,"Thanks for the ""nice"" coments guys! Terry, I offered the guy in the cottage next door a beer if he would let me hold his fish! Wendel, the horse flies and deer flies at the slide were only bad on and off most days... I taught the kids how to kill 'em. When they're flying around your head, driving you nuts, just put your hand on your the top of your head, palm down, and they just can't resist landing on your hand. Smack'em with your other hand, stomp on 'em until they are burried inches into the ground, soak the area with gas, light it on fire and put a boulder over it. That usually get's 'em!   (Seriously, the hand thing does work!) Bugs were really not a factor, except at dusk, I wouldn't know about them at dawn. I did make a little friend out of the chipmunk at the fire pit. He'd run up and down you once he found out you had some peanuts! Little bugger would take'em right out of my mouth! Funny when I'd be sitting, talking to someone and he'd run up and practically put his head in my mouth lookin for a peanut! First time viewers were quite surprised! Glad I could offer you some humour B! Micropterus hole - I had a good chat with one of the divers about their work... they have been hired by OPG to dive many of their power dams, to ensure that the gates were clear of lumber and to power wash the facings of the dam, obviously under water. Apparently the sound of the power washer attracts smallies because he told me that when they look around while working, it's not unusual for them to be surrounded by smallies, having a look to see what the commotion is about. And big one's too!!!!  HH"
242590,jwl,2008-08-23 14:47:00,1056,"That's a great family report all around, thanks for taking the time to post about that big adventure. If you thought the people around really got off on the fact that the chipmunks would come right up to you and even take peanuts out of your mouth....next time try this one , we been getting the kids to do this for years,idea of course inspired by a few wobbly pops at the camp fire, here is a pic of my oldest daughter doign what we call..""chirpy fishing"""
