Now when I click on it, the sound is there and no video  Seems like its streaming or something while the music is playing fine.  Under the topic, what are you listening to. If theres link and I click it the same happens. If the picture of the vid is there then its fine, until I get rerouted to you tube I have restored my puter to an earlier date, and scanned it. No issues at all from what I can tell. Im no puter guru by any means, a little help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all V"
