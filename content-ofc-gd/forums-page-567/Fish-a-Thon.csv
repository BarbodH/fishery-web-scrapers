558836,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-06 16:59:00,1107,LOL GBW i was just on fb and saw what your talking about
558838,GBW,2011-03-06 17:03:00,8460," If I cannot make it, help it."
558841,Marko,2011-03-06 17:05:00,854,I am always up for a carp session with bunch of great fisherman.
558855,Leecher,2011-03-06 17:24:00,7832," Thanks Dan!!!  I won't say what the next package will have in it but I'm 150% sure who ever wins it, will be very happy Just like the fisherman below: "
558861,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 17:33:00,8333,How kid friendly would this be? Seven and Five year olds.
558868,danbouck,2011-03-06 17:40:00,4380," very kid friendly, last year there was a big blow up slide for the kids and the bigger kids later on.  "
558872,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 17:46:00,8333,"The fishing part? Hate to tell a 7 year old one thing, and then not be able to deliver, especially someone else's kids."
558877,danbouck,2011-03-06 17:49:00,4380, There are a ton of panfish in there so it should keep them busy. But it is a long time to be out there. There is also a small beach for swimming there to keep them occupied.
558881,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 17:57:00,8333,Maybe we'll encourage our wives to come as well.
558888,danbouck,2011-03-06 18:48:00,4380," Bring her along, it's a family event."
558946,Leecher,2011-03-06 21:56:00,7832,"A little sneak peek for the up coming event  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2F2011%2FSneakPeekFishoThonPrize2011.mp4"">   Leechman"
558951,danbouck,2011-03-06 22:16:00,4380," Awesome, can't wait to see them!"
558985,Handlebarz,2011-03-07 00:24:00,3790,Heck I never thought that the wives and kids were not involved. I guess I am just so used to having the family with me I never think to ask if they are welcome LOL. I wonder how many places we have gone to and were not supposed to be there I guess the people got over it LOL.
558986,danbouck,2011-03-07 00:29:00,4380, lol
557547,HTHM,2011-03-03 17:54:00,4082,How long does it take for something to be added to the calendar? Or did I do it incorrectly?
557773,danbouck,2011-03-04 02:41:00,4380,"   I will have my buddy Matt in my boat, my wife and my Dad. My tinnie might be full as well. Hopefully someone can drive back to the cottage"
557813,HTHM,2011-03-04 03:20:00,4082,"I will have room for two, but they have to have strong arms to paddle back when the batteries die"
557825,tb4me,2011-03-04 03:49:00,3295,im in!! Will be bringin my boat this time.. last year we borrowed a leaky boat with an antique trolling motor..Geez guys if this event gets any bigger were going to need a new venue. I highly recomend getting there early as the launch was busy last year..I couldnt imagine any more guys out there then we had last year. Cant wait. Like the date change but it may just be a hott day out.. Come on summer!!!
557883,danbouck,2011-03-04 13:23:00,4380," haha been there (1st fish-a-thon)    We may need to figure something out if we have a ton of boats. But don't worry, everything we be figured out and it will run very smooth, I hope   We wanted a date set early this year and we will worry about the details in the next couple months."
558124,Handlebarz,2011-03-04 22:36:00,3790,how is the shore fishing? and how is the camping for tents? I really hope to get there with the family for camping. Are dogs allowed?  The wife just asked if she could win a prize as I was asking my questions I replied YES you could win some Handlebarz she was not impressed but I let her know the there would be FOF stuff she went crazy LOL I guess Dave does more for her then me
558181,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-05 00:52:00,1107,Mike the shore fishing is great and there is tent camping but it's limited I would book early dogs are allowed and hopefully everyone will get a parting gift again this year
558445,d_paluch,2011-03-05 18:19:00,343,"Hmm  good call on the camping, might just have to book a site for that weekend! Should be a great time! I hear the fishing's quite good, any insight on that?"
558452,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-05 18:34:00,1107,          All Deer Creek fish you be the judge
558458,danbouck,2011-03-05 18:54:00,4380,
558460,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-05 18:59:00,2050,"Like any body of water it can have it's tough days but there are some big bass, giant panfish and a good number of trout as well!                      "
558461,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-05 19:00:00,2050,You beat me to that one dan
558465,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-05 19:08:00,2690,"Going to have to get out for one or two of those big carp this year, bud!!"
558471,d_paluch,2011-03-05 19:19:00,343,"Needless to say, I am pumped! The bass biting cranks or plastics? Sooo excited!"
558485,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-05 19:51:00,2050, Frank for sure bud!  I want to try to target them at night one day this year we should try that out!    Depends on the day dude!  My 2 best bass were on:  1) Jerk Bait  2) Powerbait Sinkworm  3) Spinnerbait  4) Flippin' Jig
558487,d_paluch,2011-03-05 19:53:00,343,"Thanks man!  Going to have to get out there beginning of season n find some good spots, thanks to this site I now have a decent spot to check out that's not too far from home! Love this forum more and more each day"
558511,danbouck,2011-03-05 21:08:00,4380," That's on my list for this year, will probably chum a spot the morning of the fish-a-thon and fish it later on."
558522,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-05 21:29:00,2690," Maybe a bunch of us can get out for an evening of carp. Ryan and I are definitely up for it.  They are a fish that I've never specifically targetted before, but, with the OFC tourney including them + the fact that when I have caught them incidentally, they fight really well, I'm ready to give them a go!  Lots of the beggars in our local reservoir, here in Woodstock too."
558570,danbouck,2011-03-06 00:09:00,4380," I'm in, last year I targeted carp a lot and I love it"
558594,Loonietoon,2011-03-06 01:01:00,1450,If everything continues going well with the wife.. We are on Holidays that week and only in Scotland at the trailer.. will work for me and will bring the boat... Have to trim up both motors and use the bow mount
558748,Leecher,2011-03-06 14:14:00,7832,I will have a little package ready for this when the time comes
558800,GBW,2011-03-06 15:52:00,8460,the fish a thon facebook link has been plastered over the pro's pages somehow...
558801,danbouck,2011-03-06 15:54:00,4380," I saw that, you might find that a lot of pros are already fans of the page  Thanks for the support   Leechman - Thanks, your package last year was awesome!"
558802,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-06 15:54:00,1107, I don't know what your talking about
558804,vinnimon,2011-03-06 16:00:00,2593, What package?
556943,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-02 02:02:00,1107,"Ok folks Ryan,Dan and I have been talking and we have set a date for the Fish-a-thon the date is saturday july 23, 2011 this will hopefully give us some really good deer creek fishing we haven't got all the plans together and Ryan is Busy for awhile so we will fill you all in when a set plan is in place but I think we will be trying to have the entire event at Deer creek I plan on having the in-laws motor home and we can book the pavillion at DC for the after fish-a-thonis over and we can all get a bite to eat and what not .Anyways for now please let us know if you are planning on coming and Dan B can update the list on the website that Dan has done a great job on at www.fish-a-thon.com please check out the website whenever you can traffic on the site will give more oppurtunity to raise more money for casting for a cure"
556949,BiggFish,2011-03-02 02:11:00,40,"I am in. Please add me to the list SRT8 and Dan.  Thanks, Chad"
556987,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-02 03:05:00,2690,"Going to be even bigger and better this year!!  Let's shatter the number of $$$'s raised for cancer research that we put up last year. For those that haven't made it to either one of the first two, it's a fun event...on a great little spot. The cause is terrific and the support from various sponsors, last year, was amazing!"
556991,splashhopper,2011-03-02 03:15:00,2931,sign me up please.... i like the idea of keeping it onsite too.... might just camp there too
556992,danbouck,2011-03-02 03:19:00,4380,"We already have more participants than the first year!  For anyone that would like to join but doesn't have a boat, canoe or anything let us know. We can most likely arrange something."
557009,Bassaholic,2011-03-02 03:50:00,74,"Sign me up too! Was at the first event but unfortunately couldn't make last years. July definately works better for me and its a great idea to have it all at DC, now people have the opition of camping and we can have a few more ""pops"" after without having to drive anywhere. Ryan's a great host and its for a great cause that impacts almost everyones life in some way."
557013,kickingfrog,2011-03-02 03:54:00,8333,"I'm working on it. I have a canoe, but if I can get a buddy to go we would need something more fish friendly for the two of us."
557087,drewbrew,2011-03-02 14:29:00,31,"Hey me and tb4me are def in again! Last year was great,and this year will be another great one!"
557109,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-02 15:50:00,2050,"I suppose I'll be there!    haha I'm currently in the hospital with Ginny and my new born but thanks for getting the ball rolling guys!  The event will be in the parks planner this year as well so that should strum up some participants!!! Anyways I'll touch base when were back from the hospital and well get all the details sorted out!  Cheers, Ryan"
557110,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-02 15:51:00,2050, Don't worry well make sure you're all set up!
557111,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-02 15:51:00,2050,Ps. I've already got permission for larger boats again
557150,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-02 17:09:00,2690," Nice work, Ryan!!  The funniest thing last year was all our boats ""blasting off"" with the electrics It's great that the conservation authority will allow our boats in without having to strip off the motors, and, you definitely don't need more than an electric motor at DC."
557174,Governator,2011-03-02 18:22:00,879,"Never been to the area, so no gas powered motors allowed?  Do you pay for a fee to enter or is it pledges only?"
557176,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-02 18:28:00,1107,It is electric only but for this event only they let us leave gas motors on they have to be trimmed up and you can't use them for any reason. There is a entry fee to the park I think its $10. Its a reaLly fun day and a great cause hope to see ya out this year.
557278,d_paluch,2011-03-02 21:50:00,343,I'll try to make it! In my dinghy...
557311,ColdH20guy,2011-03-02 22:59:00,312,sorry guys..where is deer creek? thanks
557321,Handlebarz,2011-03-02 23:31:00,3790,Well I hope that we can make it this year it is a better time for us but it depends on how the weeks before make out as I am trying to head to Ottawa the week before if I do then it might be tight for getting out to this event.  Either way I will get some of my baits there for the prize table.
557322,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-02 23:41:00,1107,  It is in Langton Ont. check out the website there's a map on it www.fish-a-thon.com
557325,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-02 23:49:00,1107, Hope ya can make it Mike your baits will be greatly appreciated
557327,danbouck,2011-03-02 23:49:00,4380," Hope you can make it, It would be great to meet you.  BTW your baits looked amazing last year"
557340,Handlebarz,2011-03-03 00:14:00,3790,I thought this place was alot further away for us but its not that bad even if we can not get out for the weekend maybe I can get out for the day with my daughter.   Thanks for the kind words on the baits Dan I will get some of the 10's out for the event this year also.
557367,HTHM,2011-03-03 01:34:00,4082,Added to the calendar Count me in.
