I hear the river lings are not as tasty as great lakes version though?  Me and a pal went out last night to check the shack, we were thinking of moving it. And we found a hyyyuge crack about a 1000 feet long running right through our spots though, so I'm a little skeptical.  Going to play pool with the girl tonight though, other than that, I'll probably kill time making some lindy rigs etc. Maybe paint some homemade cranks I got in the works"

Thanks for that offer though, very much appreciated...  Very sad about that 87yr old lady in the Accident, and I sure hope that Dangerous goods load doesn't cause the area any trouble...
