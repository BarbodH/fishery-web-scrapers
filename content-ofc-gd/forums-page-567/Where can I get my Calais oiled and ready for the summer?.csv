557749,BillM,2011-03-04 02:07:00,17367,"I'm usually a do it yourselfer, but the idea of taking this not so cheap reel apart and doing this myself doesn't sit very well with me.  Anyone know someone or some place local to the Barrie area that I could take it in and get it cleaned/oiled?  I was thinking the only place I know of is Trombleys, but I'm not to up on their track record."
557760,irishfield,2011-03-04 02:17:00,26272,Did you say you wanted to get your Cialis Cleaned and Oiled? Place on Hwy 90.. No?
557764,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 02:31:00,8333,"Resisting the temptation that Wayne was unable to. There is a guy in Orillia that does rods and reels (biting tongue). Rocky or Rockys, I haven't used him yet but I'm taking too oldish Abus up there and see if he can put some life in them."

557781,uglyfish,2011-03-04 02:46:00,981,rockys tackle repair in orillia. they are a warrenty and service center for many brands. and they are excellant to deal with in my experience!
557783,BillM,2011-03-04 02:49:00,17367," Excellent, thanks bud!  Exactly what I wanted to hear."
557788,uglyfish,2011-03-04 02:53:00,981,anytime bud!
557995,JohnF,2011-03-04 17:32:00,3494, You're wise. When I got the new Calcutta last summer I asked Garry 2rs for some help with setting it up. He showed me stuff I'd never have figured out for myself. I'd have busted something for sure if I'd tried doing that myself. It's just not intuitive at all.  JF
558051,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 20:17:00,8333,Just dropped my two reels off this afternoon. When they are ready I'll also make a stop at Mariposa bakery.
558062,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-04 20:33:00,10439,"Gettin' your Calais Oiled, is that what the kids are calling it these days Bill?"
558077,spinnerdoc,2011-03-04 21:06:00,556,I don't like the guy but aikman's in missisauga. He's a warranty repair shop for certain manufacturers.
558298,tknohpy,2011-03-05 13:01:00,162,I oiled and greased my own.  Just search for shimano reel maintenance and you will find a step by step to do it.  It was really simple.
558304,ChrisK,2011-03-05 13:15:00,2772,"Bill, Just in case you decide to do this yourself and you need the schematics..... http://www.reelschematic.com/schematics/shimano.php"
558566,blue pickeral,2011-03-05 23:55:00,267,Remember seeing on Shimano site some platinum plan you are entitled to upon registration....discount maintenance and 48 hour return time ? etc. Might be worth a call to customer service to find out.
558599,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-06 01:06:00,3761, I know it's not answering your question but I just self serviced my Curado last week and it went great and feels awesome now. Here is the first link to a 3 or 4 video segment done by somebody at Shimano in the reel service department. Although he is working on a Citica it's a great reference for you guys.
