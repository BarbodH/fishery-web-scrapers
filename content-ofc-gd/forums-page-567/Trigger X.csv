I have heard it is better then gulp but who knows !!! I like the look of the trigger x walleye minnow , could be good for lakers this soft water season. Thanks"
558744,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 14:01:00,8333,I picked up the leach and something else for walleye last year. I use gulp and other plastics in the place of bait. Last year though I ended up on a troll bite and never broke out the trigger x or the gulp.

558885,ADB,2011-03-06 18:39:00,444,I hated the texture.  They literally slide off the hooks in some applications.
559011,bassmaster4,2011-03-07 02:59:00,801,gulp has worked a lot better for me. i bought 3 packages of trigger x last season and had very little luck with it.
559015,Cudz,2011-03-07 03:17:00,2652,Their senko style worm is too skinny to fit on my o rings.  They slide right though.  I just remembered I have a bunch of them and i meant to use them for ice fishing.  Thnaks for reminding me.
