558786,John,2011-03-06 15:22:00,2956," You're delusional, nothing better than an old school salt water fish fry, with skin..."
558827,Billy Bob,2011-03-06 16:43:00,5865," I'll eat it either way.....doesn't matter to me......at one time ""Yellow Pike"" (walleye) and ""Blue Pike"" dinners out sold haddock 10 - 1. But now every tavern here only sells haddock dinners because ""yellow pike"" is to darn expensive compared to haddock....but haddock is now selling for a average of $9.99 per dinner....it wasn't too long ago a fish fry was only $4.99 to $5.99 per dinner.  The Friday fish fry tradition at your local tavern is alive and well in the Buffalo area....one of the few traditions that has survived...."
