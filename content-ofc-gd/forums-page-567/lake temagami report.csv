I did not get much time to fish with wayne but the whole operation out there was for us to meet. Wayne put us on some spots that we should try and of corse he catches we dont and in 15 feet of water. i started out in 30 and moved out into about 48 and still no action, i did mark a few but that was it. we then moved down the lake to a spot i fish in the summer months and sometimes in the winter months. we did not do well there even though we only spent about half hour or so there..all in all it was nice to finally meet wayne and for all of you who have not met him, i can tell you he is a real nice guy. will spend more time with him in temagami for sure in years to come.  here are some fish from one mornings catch, we gave the fish some beer too its only fair    nice laker    picture of wayne taking pictures of me and my gang    we fished some back lakes for specs but had no luck.. lots of snow on back lakes    picture of wayne making some soup, had close the hut do to strong winds..    here we are night time fishing for walleye, we got a few all small  but tasty    a shot of the sun behind the trees and the walleye fishing begins    all in all it was a great trip once again with the gang and it was nice to meet new friends out on my favorite lake . will be back first week of june this time it will be soft water that dont stop the fishing for me. hope you enjoyed the report.."
