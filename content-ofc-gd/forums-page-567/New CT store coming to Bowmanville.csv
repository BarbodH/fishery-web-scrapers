The fishing dept is a total waste of time, they could do so much better there. I drive out of my way to go to lindsay CT, its got everything!! Its not just the fishing dept that sucks either, the whole place is out of stock.  S."

558118,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-04 22:25:00,2582, I hear you on both counts Shayne. The Bowanville CT is the closest one for me to go too and I'm never in it for the same reasons you stated.  And the Lindsay store is the best CT I have ever been in.
558129,Joey,2011-03-04 22:46:00,9122,Nothing to get excited about.  Just another store to advertise stuff on sale that they don't actually have
558253,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-05 04:01:00,2582,"Unfortunately I have to agree with you Joey. CT has become a real disappointment in the last 5-6 years with regards to actually having the flyer stuff available when you go into the store. In the fall they had something I was looking for in there flyer. The 3 closest stores in Durham region had a grand total of 1 item between them in inventory....BEFORE the sale even started. Nobody, no how can ever convince me that this is an acceptable business practice"
558258,ketchenany,2011-03-05 04:49:00,3229,"  LOL Wayne, I have to deal with him every Sunday at our family dinner. I will pass it on.( I GET NO FAVOURS)  But remember this about stocking ( I was in St Marten at this time last year  and found no winter coats) I have a Scottish friend who many,  many years ago went to a Dominion store in a mainly Hebrew neighborhood and asked where they had the pork chops! The manager told him we could order some for  Being in the marketing/advertising ( And  NOT promoting CT in any way) unless CCMT wants to step in. If it doesn't sell it only takes up space, Stock what you sell.  I love Robertson's in Dorset, Ontario, This place is amazing, better than CT and Wolly!"
558271,Garnet,2011-03-05 09:27:00,2056,You boys need to go to CT Kingston take Sharbot rd south.  Both the Lindsay and Kingston have 1 thing in common. They are Independently owned and can put any product they can sell in there store.  Bowmanville and most other CT are corp. stores and just take what some geek sends them.
558448,ccmtcanada,2011-03-05 18:27:00,7971,All Canadian Tire stores are owned independently from Canadian Tire Corp.  Some dealers are better than others at stocking their shelves and catering to their local areas than others.  Some try to keep too tight a reign on their inventory costs and unfortunately they are out of stock too often.  That's not to say that corp messes up at times as well with stock availability.  All Canadian Tire stores are franchises...and how well it runs depends on the dealers that own them.

558789,Garnet,2011-03-06 15:33:00,2056,Another store that has the people to go out and get product independently is Bellville CT great fishing selection.
558815,perchslayer666,2011-03-06 16:19:00,280,"You guys want a real Canadian Tire store to check out???  Go to the one in Belleville, it will blow your mind."
