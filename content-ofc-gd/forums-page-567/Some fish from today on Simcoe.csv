558660,Cudz,2011-03-06 03:32:00,2652,"I have not been out as much as I would like to but I got out today despite the rain.  Ice thickness was great but I would have been better off with skates on.  I am very thankful for the recently purchased waterproof boots. No snow on the lake so it is like a rink out there. I only fished in the morning and only managed to land 2 fish.  Both were big lakers.  I marked tons of fish out there and they were very active.  I lost 4 other fish and one was big.  I also had about 3 more bites on top of that.  All lakers.  Fish were chasing like crazy today but they weren't commiting totally.  I bet I had over 25 chasers today.  The first pic of the laker is actually the big one of the day and it weighed in a hair under 10.5 pounds.  The second fish was smaller and thinner and I actually used the rod as a reference.  Nice fish and the rod is 28"" long about the same as the fish.  You will have to forgive pic quality as I was by myself and the lens kept fogging up and I was in a hurry as I released both fish.  Pic quality is also crap because my camera takes bad pics (can't stand it. Olympus Stylus tough).  Whitey pics are from last week or the weekend before.  Can't remember.  Anyway my buddy and I got out and managed a couple of nice whiteys. Bigger Laker. A real football   Smaller laker   Whitey  "

With all this snow we are getting right now, it will be glare ice covered by snow.  If you are coming up this way tomorrow (Sunday) take care and be cautious."
