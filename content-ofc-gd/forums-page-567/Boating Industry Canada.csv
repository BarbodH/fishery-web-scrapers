558363,mercman,2011-03-05 15:30:00,7054,"Excellent article,  thanks for sharing it Henry !! I especially like the idea for boating courses for the women.I will be patiently showing mine how to operate my new boat when it arrives.One never knows what may happen out on the water, and i for one would feel safer knowing she could get us safely back to shore if something happened to me on the water.   PAUL"

558391,cwpowell,2011-03-05 16:09:00,265,Beauty congrats man.  My girlfriend loves to drive our boat. She loves to be on the water fishing or just cruising. She was formally trained to sail at Kingston Yacht Club for about 10 years and I'm sure has more boat control in her left finger then I do in my whole body.

558490,craigdritchie,2011-03-05 20:04:00,1586,"I'm happy for you Henry, but I'm also disappointed that Boating Industry Canada appears to have ripped off an article I wrote in December 2009 (my story on the Canadian boat industry reaching out to ethnic minority groups was published in the January 2010 issue of Boating Business magazine). You can read a web link of it here.     I like how they even copied my idea to illustrate the story by using a boat advertisement with Chinese text. Coincidence?  I know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but I sure wish these guys would come up with their own ideas instead of ripping off mine."
