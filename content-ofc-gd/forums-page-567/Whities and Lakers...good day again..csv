558829,limeyangler,2011-03-06 16:50:00,5204,"Hi All,  Went out for some more whitefish action, got some nice trout too.  When the whitefish bite is on it cant be beat for fun IMO, especially when all the fish are between 22""and 25"". A couple of times we thought we had trout on when in fact it was a whitefish, when they want to fight they are no slouches!  Fish were all from 38'FOW, live bait was not popular with the feeeeshes yesterday, with white tube jigs from 4"" to 1"" taking all the fish, occasionally these were tipped with a minnow chunk for some FLAVA.  It was a morning bite with a real quiet spell of about an hour when the smelt all but dissappeared from screen. The fish were still there but not one would bite, apart from 2 'bumps' from what appeared to be Lakers higher up the water column. Then....like magic the switch was flicked back to 'ON' and for the last hour from 12-1pm we got a few more whitefish and a trout.

(released to breed and fight again )      ANOTHER NICE LAKER      I thought i'd put together a recipe video of my whitefish stew that we had last night....fresh fish...anyway you do it is good but I kinda came by it by accident a year ago when i decided i wanted to eat fish other than fried.  I had recently returned from France at the time and had had the opportunity to have some excellent fish soup while there. I thought i'd try to recreate the soup with a 'clam' twist as I make spaghetti vongole (clam sauce) often and always have the ingredients for it at home.  I also added some shrimp to the mix cuz there were some in the freezer and my wife loves them.  Basically throw it all into the tomato soup and cook......really good served with fresh garlic bread.

558928,Joeytier,2011-03-06 20:44:00,3990,I'm definitely going to try some variant of that recipe.  I'd imagine any light-fleshed fish would be fine.  Thanks for the report!

Sucks to be me eh?  I'll try and do better for ya Captain    It aint bad....i'm still at the experimental stages with it....but i'm getting there.    Thanks Jacques, lol...dunno who or what cooking with Yan is...oh well.     I imagine it would be.....the think i like about whitefish for a stew type recipe is that it is a firm meaty flesh that does not disintegrate when cooked in liquid, i'd imagine walleye would just fall apart.    OK....that is one of the most generous replies i've had, Thanks man"

I'll have to watch the vids when I'm at home, really interested in the recipe. I'm looking for a healthier way to eat them, as I only know how to cook fish one way, fried in breading!"
