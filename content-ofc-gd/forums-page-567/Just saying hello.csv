558427,DundasSteelheader,2011-03-05 17:26:00,166,"Hello everyone, My name is Sean and I am a 14 year old steelheader. I just started out this year and I really enjoy it. I started with a spinning reel but switched over to a centrepin and I love it. I usually go to rivers near me like the Bronte, the Grand and the Credit and sometimes on weekends I go up north to the Saugeen or Beaver. In the summer I do some bass and walleye fishing in my families 14' boat and I also do some fly fishing, usually the upper grand or whitemans creek.  I have been on this site a ton and finally joined. I really enjoy all the stories and pictures that people post, and the classifieds. Hopefully an Islander will pop up soon  Sean  If I can figure this out, here are some pics of some steelhead I caught this winter (Sorry about the quality)   "
