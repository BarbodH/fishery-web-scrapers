557925,flyfisherkirk,2011-03-04 15:12:00,23,"Hello All I wonder if anyone can recommend  a local fly shop here in the GTA. A shop with  products, accessories and maybe a bit of fishing feedback. And, you can exclude Le Baron and Wilson's. It seems Le Baron has no fly fishers working there, and Wilson's, is a bit pushy and expensive. thanks and tight Lines all. Fred"
557963,adempsey,2011-03-04 16:46:00,1498," I am no fly fishermen, but I do go to a lot of angling shops.   Angling Specialties on Highway 7 carries a lot of fly fishing materials - not sure about rods/reels/waders etc..  He even has a tying station set up in the back so I assume he uses it.  From the few times I was there it looks to me like a lot of float fishers buy bait there.  Store is in need of a serious clean up though.  BPS also seems to have a fairly big fly section with a dedicated staff member in the ""mini store"".  I have also ordered online from Reelflies.ca.   Not sure if they sell materials or only pre-tied flies.  Not sure if that was helpful, but that's all I got!!  Cheers!"

559087,dannyboy,2011-03-07 14:14:00,367,The First Cast in Guelph is probably the best stocked shop around for fly tying materials. John's Fly Materials is a good local on-line store.  Dan
559164,FishTracker,2011-03-07 18:02:00,47,"If you go a little further West, try Grindstone Angling in Waterdown (24 Mill Street North).  The website is a little out of date (www.grindstoneangling.com) but the staff are very knowledgeable and they carry a lot of really good quality gear at a good price.  It's worth the drive even to go in and talk to the staff!"
