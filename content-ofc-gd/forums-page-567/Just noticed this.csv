558747,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 14:12:00,8333,"This year the fourth Friday in April is Good Friday...  Logic would follow that the fourth Saturday in April is the next day.  With extended seasons this may not be much of an issue for many, but it is a bit of a hiccup for some plans.  I know there will be a bunch of people fishing the river mouths with me on Friday."
558749,Roy,2011-03-06 14:15:00,13728,"Not too swift today, Rob. Trying to figure this out... hmmmm"
558752,skeeter,2011-03-06 14:21:00,1907,
558760,Spiel,2011-03-06 14:29:00,9065,"  Because there's 5 Saturdays in April this year Roy, trout season, which opens the 4th Sat. in April is a week early this year."
558761,Roy,2011-03-06 14:38:00,13728,OK and this matters how?
558765,mbac31,2011-03-06 14:42:00,904,I was hoping I would be fishing by myself this year but looks like I wont now. Most didnt figure this out.
558767,Spiel,2011-03-06 14:44:00,9065," For you and me, it's moot."
558774,aplumma,2011-03-06 14:53:00,6896,   since we all at some time are YOU and a ME does that mean we are all moot???   Art
558777,John,2011-03-06 15:13:00,2956, I is moot for sure not certain about me.........
558780,Fisherman,2011-03-06 15:14:00,7201,"Okay, I know I'm slightly wacked by some pills this morning, but yes, after every friday comes a saturday, been doing that for a loooooong time and don't see any change soon.  So what the heck is the difference between the 4th and 5th saturday, other the other 6 days between them.  I'm sure the trout don't know, just sneak up on them and fish.  Jeez, you should be so lucky it's early this year."
558785,solopaddler,2011-03-06 15:21:00,8605,The best steelhead fishing is over by the opener anyhow.  Opener is for resident fish.
558787,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 15:26:00,8333,"I was not my intention to be so cryptic.  The traditional trout opener in most parts of southern Ontario, as well as Algonquin Park, is the 4th Saturday,  This year Easter is the same weekend.  That just throws a wrench at some of my options."
558791,irishfield,2011-03-06 15:35:00,26272,Can't you have an easter egg hunt down near the river??
558792,Fisherman,2011-03-06 15:36:00,7201,"Okay, so feed the Easter Bunny some Ex-lax to advance the egg laying or Immodium to plug him up and he can lay the eggs the week after. Personally, I would go for the Immodium so the eggs won't be runny."
558793,irishfield,2011-03-06 15:37:00,26272,
558796,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 15:42:00,8333, However not every fourth Saturday is preceded by the fourth Friday.
558798,kickingfrog,2011-03-06 15:45:00,8333," No argument here, but brookies and Algonquin are often part of the opener for me."
558810,Pigeontroller,2011-03-06 16:12:00,2793,The omly relevance of that date is that its then only 43 days till Muskie Opener!
558812,4x4bassin,2011-03-06 16:14:00,1025,There could be one problem with the opener happening a bit earlier and that the lakes in the north part of algonquin could be still iced over especially this year with the weather we have had !
558830,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-06 16:52:00,0,  I couldn't agree more. The season ends for me and I'll be setting up for the first of the following month that weekend anyway.
558851,Crazy Ivan,2011-03-06 17:16:00,184, Thanks for pointing this out! I always thought opener was the last Sat. in April regardless of how many Saturdays in the month. I would prefer a non-holiday weekend.
558873,camillj,2011-03-06 17:46:00,1988,It always used to be the last Saturday in April ... in fact I had my calendar all booked for the 29th ... guess I better crack out the regs
558882,Crazy Ivan,2011-03-06 18:02:00,184, Regs. for zone 16. http://www.mnr.gov.o...mnr_e001335.pdf  My interest is for southern Georgian Bay.
