558858,TDunn,2011-03-06 17:29:00,680,"  I had a 6""6 triumph! From what I remember it was a fairly stiff rod and I did like it for jerkbaits. Only used it twice tho. Someone has a new St.Croix and Daiwa baitcasting combo that they found on highway 17...  TDunn"
558860,uglyfish,2011-03-06 17:30:00,981,"i know a guy on the BPS prostaff and uses their rods and reels. he says te rods are amazing for the prices, and the reels are good too. he said they dont last as long as other brands might, but overall the performance or the reels is quite good. and this guy is no slouch when it comes to winning big money on big water.  but overall, im not really ovrly impressed with the sale, nuthin overly wowed me in the flyer.  10 bucks off a $200+ doesnt impress me all that much. some decent tackle sales. would like to see more high end gear on sale. not them clearing out their old crap. the pro qualifier rainsuits onsale for 169 is a nice deal, and that will likely be the only reason i make the trip out."
558862,BFSC Kevin,2011-03-06 17:34:00,1351,"  Yup.. I'm looking at my Lebaron catalog and lebaron's reg prices are at 199.94 and 148.63 for the patriarch and supreme xt. With club discount or no tax sale, its about the same as bass pro with the reel trade in deal. Meh..."
558870,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 17:42:00,4399,"  You might get more response with a new thread, this is/was a BPS spring classic thread!!!"
558880,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 17:55:00,4399,"  Yes 10 bucks off a 200 reel wouldn`t get my lazy   off the sofa but 5 Terminator spinner baits for 10 bucks,JMS reel for 89.99, 660 yard of trilene for 4.97 would."
558917,beertech,2011-03-06 20:10:00,118,Im sure there are a couple good deals.  To be fair please list the items you feel are a great deal  
558919,beertech,2011-03-06 20:13:00,118,yeah and compare radio world prices on electronics.  most fishfinder are 150 or more cheaper than basspro sale prices.  
558943,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 21:52:00,4399,  I really don`t feel like going back and forth with you on this just can`t be bothered!!!  I think anybody with half a brain would compare prices before laying done their cash yes!!!
558952,misfish,2011-03-06 22:24:00,29133,"Lebarons in Mississaga would be worth my drive,as Brant meats,  is just down around the corner.Now that would be worth the drive,and they dont have sales."

558223,2jack2,2011-03-05 01:49:00,92, where are you from?
558229,misfish,2011-03-05 01:59:00,29133,"Anyone catch thier Stateside commercial on Speedtv? Their sale is the week before ours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BUT,,,,,,,,,,They show the same flyer as the one here with the same pricing?"
558243,adempsey,2011-03-05 02:49:00,1498," Actually, if you compare the flyers, some prices are the same, some are lower and some are even higher in the US."
558245,MSBruno,2011-03-05 03:06:00,369,Anyone get the barcode to scan at the bottom of page 2?  It sends me to some youtube page?!??!??
558286,spincast,2011-03-05 12:21:00,3279,  I'll be there on the Sunday GBW and I have no problem picking one up for you if  no one is getting there sooner. PM me if you want me to. We can figure out how to get it across TO pretty easy I would think.
558366,GBW,2011-03-05 15:36:00,8460,I'm in Brooklin (North end of Whitby) but I work downtown TO.
558423,2jack2,2011-03-05 17:07:00,92,"you got me PM, if you are from Whitby, you can pick it up in pickering also."
558424,adempsey,2011-03-05 17:11:00,1498,I think that reel is a daily special??  So Friday March 25th only.  Most likely you would have to be there right when the store opens as well.
558457,Snidley,2011-03-05 18:54:00,620,"AVOID at all costs BassPro reels. They are awful. Their rods on the other hand are very good as are their lures. For some reason they really produce terrible reels. There are many better, cheaper reels to purchase."
558472,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-05 19:20:00,4399,I have a BPS pro qualifier and it is a fine reel and by all accounts JMS signature reels are very good aswell.  Now if your talking about the 30 and 40 dollar BPS reels you maybe right!!!
558475,misfish,2011-03-05 19:25:00,29133,  I have 2 bait casters and one with the flipping feature.No issues as of yet.4 yrs. Im thinking you got a bad reel and expressing your OP.
558479,GBW,2011-03-05 19:41:00,8460,"I had a BPS reel that I didn't like and sold it and the new user loves it, go figure. The JMS series is the companies pride and joy so it should be better then the other BPS branded ones. just saying..."
558659,2jack2,2011-03-06 03:31:00,92,"I own a Johnny Morris Elite (blue color) B/C reel for last 4 years, never let me down, I am getting the new 2011 model this year."
558666,Cudz,2011-03-06 03:46:00,2652,Have you had the reel for 4 years or have you fished with it for 4 years? In your case there is a big difference. lol  GBW buy a $3 ice reel from walmart for the trade in and you get and extra like $20 or $30 bucks back depending on the original price.
558705,misfish,2011-03-06 10:07:00,29133, They got well used for 4 years smart  They are now 6 years old.LOL
558778,GBW,2011-03-06 15:13:00,8460,"So, what new rod to buy to go with the new baitcaster? the St. Croix Triumph, Wright & McGill Skeet Reese Signature Series or Gary Loomis TFO Signature one?  For the rod I have $100 to spend and it's going to be a backup to sit in the boat when needed (well, that's the plan).  It will be a jerkbait rod for casting and trolling.  Thoughts?"
558813,perchslayer666,2011-03-06 16:17:00,280,  This guy's in the dark. Buy a $200 BPS reel and tell me its junk....
558822,Live2fish85,2011-03-06 16:38:00,1633,I know I'm going to be spending alot lol lost alot of my tackle this year when it was stolen. But I have a quick question I'm buying a St. Croix rod for flipping and I am wondering if the Pro Qualifier or the Nitro would be best I may use it for crankbaiting the odd time but likely will use my other St. Croix.
558825,Bernie66,2011-03-06 16:41:00,123,"If I had $200 to spend, there are a lot of reels I would look at before touching a BPS model.  I am with Snidley."
558826,beertech,2011-03-06 16:42:00,118,I don;t see much for deals to be honest.  My local tackle stores everyday prices are cheaper. 3 quarters of the flyer isn;t even sale prices. eg pfeuger supreme xt 149 at basspro.  129 every day of the week at local tackle store  pfeuger patriarch 199 on sale 20 off.  local tackle store 189 all year.  electronics and trolling motors are marked up crazy to begin with.  check your prices people email your local tackle stores or check your online stores before you buy into their sale prices.   
558828,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 16:45:00,4399,  I have a PQ and like it but I would buy the JMS at the BPS sale for 89.99!
558834,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 16:56:00,4399,"  Thats a fair statement but Mr Snidley statement that BPS reels are awful is not necessarily accurate, he must be talking about the 30 dollar reels!  The BPS branded equipment that I have is pretty good!"
558837,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-06 17:02:00,4399,  I must have a different flyer than you because is see some pretty good deals!!!  To each his own!
558854,GBW,2011-03-06 17:18:00,8460,any thoughts here or should I start a new post?
557608,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-03 20:20:00,4399,"Just browsed the flyer and there is some great deals to be had,going to have to plan a trip or two to BPS.  Just a heads up to American Express this could get ugly!!!"
557610,misfish,2011-03-03 20:36:00,29133,"Ya were going to make a trip down to Highland farms,need supplies.    So figured why not slip into BPS.   I still have a few gift certificates I havent burnt up yet."
557672,GBW,2011-03-04 00:11:00,8460,"anyone know if the JM sig reel that is on sale on the 25th comes in a lefty?  if it does, can someone pick one up for me in a 6:4:1 ratio?"
557674,Roy,2011-03-04 00:24:00,13728,"Yes Geoff, it comes in a left. $159.99... JMX10HLD 6.4:1. Just checked with Vaughan.  But sorry, I can't help you from here."
557679,GBW,2011-03-04 00:35:00,8460,"How did you get through Roy?  I spent the last 30 min trying to get a hold of some one on the phone.  When I did, they have NO clue if they are going to get even one of the # JMX10HLD in stock.  ""We get what we get for these clear out deals"" I was told...      But thanks."
557700,d_paluch,2011-03-04 00:59:00,343,"any insight on the front page offer of the baitcasting combo for $79.99. I have always used spincast and want to try baitcast, but don't want to spend much $$.  Can't seem to find the product in their catalog either."
557709,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-04 01:28:00,4399,  Even better Roy they have a daily special on March 25th JM signiture series 89.95 limit of 2 and terminator spinner baits 5 for 10 buck limit of 10.  Lets go shopping!!!
557714,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-04 01:33:00,4399,  I would take a serious look at the JM sig. reel I mentioned in the previous post far better reel.  If your just getting started I think more dollars in the reel would be better than a cheap combo.
557731,HTHM,2011-03-04 01:52:00,4082,What he said X5
557732,GBW,2011-03-04 01:55:00,8460,"100%  you get what you pay for. For me this is a back up reel incase one blows up.  My spinning is my go to stuff but my other baitcaster is a Curado 301 series for bigger fish.  So I just want to have another combo that I don't spend a lot on and can do the job.  the better BPS-JM series I'm told are good but that deal on the Curado for $170 (or so) looks like a back-up,back-up plan.  I have been told any of the BPS-JM-Sig. series in the last 2 years (starting at the 'gold' one) are good.  Don't spend $100 or less on a combo as you will either never learn how to use it well, never like it, or it will just die on you.  I had the BPS Extreme combo and sold it as good as new for 1/2 the price in 1-year time.  Just MHO."
557733,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 01:57:00,8333,"I'll second the theory of spending a bit more on the reel in a baitcast set-up than the rod. A good reel can be had for around a $100 and can last long enough for you to upgrade the rod later. If the reel is not ""good"" (I don't know if the one in question is or not) you might not ever like using it."
557734,d_paluch,2011-03-04 01:57:00,343,"hmm, still realllly can't afford much. But as with life I am sure I can make some exceptions  Just gotta think about not needing to upgrade in the future and I should be good.  By the way, where do you see the daily specials?"
557735,Nipfisher,2011-03-04 01:58:00,2449, Yep. I went into BPS about 3 years ago and asked some guy at the counter for a medium priced baitcaster. Not the cheapest and not the most expensive. I came away with a cheepo Diawa Procaster. It is simple and works but the drag adjustments suck and it would never land a big fish. You get what you pay for and starting cheap won't sell you on baitcasting.
557741,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 02:02:00,8333," I don't think they are on the website yet, but the flyer that some of us have received in the mail does have them."
557745,GBW,2011-03-04 02:03:00,8460,"You have to look at the flyer mailed out or online. You are WAY better off to save and spend/buy a good one when you can rather then spend less and tinker.  I can tell you that because I did that and REGRET IT!  I would have more $ now in my pocket then going the cost saving way. Like I said, for me, this is a reel/rod/combo that is going to sit in my boat all year unless I need it."
557748,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 02:07:00,8333,The daily specials are on line now (they weren't last night) make sure you're looking at the Canadian deals.
557828,MSBruno,2011-03-04 03:58:00,369,I have a feelig that there will be a lot of terminator spinner baits in the water this year.
557904,GBW,2011-03-04 14:33:00,8460,Can anyone help me out here?
558047,Banger68,2011-03-04 20:00:00,157,Any ideas why the JM Signature Reel in the daily specials is a different pic then the regular section of the site? Are there two different signature reels?
558048,GBW,2011-03-04 20:01:00,8460,the one selling for $89 for the one day only is the 2010 one and the other is the 2011 version.
558065,d_paluch,2011-03-04 20:36:00,343,"Weird, still can't find the daily specials.  I click on the spring break thing, then change the city to Toronto, and when I click on daily specials it says 'Daily Speicals! Coming Soon' What am I doing wrong lol"
558066,kickingfrog,2011-03-04 20:37:00,8333,Let's see if this works.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CFPageC?storeId=10151&catalogId=10001&langId=-1&appID=163&option=3&template=circular.cfm&catalog=sfc_tor_11_tab&storeID=11&om_rid=CIBQLd&om_mid=_BNcTbNB8ZdQQ4u  Edit It worked.
558068,d_paluch,2011-03-04 20:42:00,343," Thanks a ton! I was trying to find it through the banner for the spring fishing event! Stupid me  Thanks kickingfrog!   aww, too bad no good daily's on the 27th when Mercer's going to be there"
558092,irishfield,2011-03-04 21:37:00,26272,"Just remember guys... it's not a ""sale"" if you don't really need it! lol  {that and you can probably find it cheaper on ebay)"
