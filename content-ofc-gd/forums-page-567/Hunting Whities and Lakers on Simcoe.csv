559351,skeeter,2011-03-08 01:29:00,1907,"Well we finally got out today to hunt down some fish with Bill and Andy. We met up at a secret location(thanks for the timmies, andy) Then headed out to our first location. Marking lots on the finder but, No one was hungry. Second location, no one hungry Third location, same crap. Forth location, same thing, lots on the finder but no whities willing to come out to play. Then finally Bill yells, I GOT ONE !!! Up comes a real nice 5LB 4OZ laker.      That was the only fish willing to play today, but we had a great time ."

559462,Rod Caster,2011-03-08 12:40:00,5784,Nice trout! I'd be more than happy catching one of them. Looks like a bright day out there...did yu get a tan?
559468,Aaron Shirley,2011-03-08 12:50:00,655,"Wow, how things change in a week. Good to see the ice is still good enough to drive out after all that rain. Tough going, but we did have strange unstable weather recently. Tony and I wanted to hit Simcoe on the weekend, but the weather messed up our plans. We are hoping to get out this weekend. Hope it picks up by then, it's coming to an end.  Good fishing!"
559470,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-08 13:05:00,2690," That makes three of us, actually four...one week left!!!  Starting to get the ""steelie"" itch now  Nice fish, skeeter!"
559474,skeeter,2011-03-08 13:17:00,1907,"did yu get a tan? LOL--Yup  Good to see the ice is still good enough to drive out after all that rain.  Funny you should say that Aaron. Here's part of the report Bill posted on our fishing board.  Skeeter jumps in the club cab and Andy in the front passenger side, off we go on the Ice all is well at the crack but it is open 6 inches and wet, we get well past the crack then boom truck drops atleast 6 inches Ice and water just flying everywhere, Andy is out the door Skeeter is heading for the broken Window hole I am watching them and almost laughing, put the truck in 4x4 back and forth a few times and were out and on or way again a short ways later and talking about what just happens down it goe's again lol."
559476,skeeter,2011-03-08 13:30:00,1907,"Hint:  If you do plan on driving out, stay on the ruff ice, NOT the smooth stuff that looks like a pond.LOL under the 2"" of ice is 6-8"" of water, then the 16"" of good ice."
559479,Leecher,2011-03-08 13:43:00,7832,Nicely done Skeet
