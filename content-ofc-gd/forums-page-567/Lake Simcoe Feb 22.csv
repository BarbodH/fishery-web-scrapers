I think the days total was 4 lakers and 6 or 7 whitefish.  http://www.youtube.com/user/TheVirtualAngler?feature=mhum  Lakers came on a #12 treble with a 1/8oz split shot up 6"" from a lively shiner. Most of the whitefish came on spreader tip-up rig.  Hope the ice holds up for some fishing next week.  Cheers, Andrew"
