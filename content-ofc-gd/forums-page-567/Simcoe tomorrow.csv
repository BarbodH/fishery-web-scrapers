558603,alphaalpha,2011-03-06 01:18:00,475,"Planning on heading out tomorrow morning. Do you think it will be good to go.  I am just walking on so I'm sure there will still be lots of ice for that but will the edges to get on be screwed after all this rain?  Just don't want to waste a couple hours driving up there if we cant even get on the ice.  Thanks,  AA"

558620,alphaalpha,2011-03-06 01:40:00,475,Thanks for the replies. I haven't decided yet where we are going out of. Maybe IBP. On my phone at the moment as I'm out for the night.  Will post where we are heading out of if you want to stop by and say hi.

558626,EC1,2011-03-06 02:04:00,930,"Be ready for some slushy conditions. Left Simcoe at about 6 today, and by then it was snowing and there's no way in hell that it will freeze 3 inches of water overnight."
558640,dhickey,2011-03-06 02:34:00,1038,IBP is no problem for me ! would like to meet new people that share the passion. my profile allows you to email me?  it will be messy out there but well worth it i think!  still looking for whytie this year.
558643,NAW,2011-03-06 02:37:00,4022,"I'm heading out near IBP tomorrow.  What do you guys think..  leave the snowmobile at home and walk out??  Or bring the sled out for one last rip.??  I haven't been out on Simcoe for 3 weeks now, so I have no idea of the conditions.  Can only assume they're garbage..  Edit...  It's 9:30 and snowing like a bugger in Barrie as we speak."
558644,Fisherman,2011-03-06 02:39:00,7201,"Just looked out the window, there's a raging snow storm right now, probably got 5cm in the last hour."
558645,BUSTER,2011-03-06 02:52:00,1336,"I', hitting Hales hut in the morn..."
558657,alphaalpha,2011-03-06 03:26:00,475,My brother-in-law jus told me now he doesn't want to go for the day. As its a bit of a hike I want to go for pretty much the whole day. Salty if you want to partner up let me know.  I don't really want to drag the hut and all my gear out just for me.
558662,Cudz,2011-03-06 03:36:00,2652,"True I got off the ice at noon today and there was 3"" of standing water everywhere.  It is going to be messy but there is a good amount of ice out there.  I think I measured about 13"" tight lines"
558679,alphaalpha,2011-03-06 04:24:00,475,Heading home now.  Salty hasn't messaged me.  Anyone else up for going message me here or pm otherwise I will probably just go into work tomorrow....

558694,alphaalpha,2011-03-06 04:41:00,475, just sent you a private message.  i drag a fair amount of gear but nothing i can't really handle myself.  I just don't find it worth the hassle if i am solo.  I take out a hut and heater and propane tank but its pretty mobile on the ski rig that i have.
