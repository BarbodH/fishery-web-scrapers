I understand there are a lot of steel headers around here and I would like to try my luck at catching one or two. I don't get out a lot because of school and work but if anyone would take the opportunity to take me out and give me a lesson or just hang out and fish that would be really cool.  I have lots of gear, and it wouldnt be a problem to pick up a few new things.  Thanks again guys.  Also travel is not a problem really I have a car and don't mind a short drive."

Steelhead aren't exactly very smart, lol.  The biggest thing is to make sure you're not running to short of a lead and change things up until you figure out a pattern.  I've found that 99% of the guys on the river are more then willing to help out a newb and give you a few pointers.  Watch what other people are doing and if it's working for them, then it should work for you.  I always look at what type of leads people are running if I'm on a new piece of water..  In the spring you can run all kinds of baits and still get bit.  Worms (live and Berkley trout worms), dead minnows, roe, whatever.."
