This will be my first year targeting both on the fly rod.  Does anyone recognize what kind of rod/reel this guy is using? Bass on the fly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpVVKvrnu0   Watch how these Northerns stalk these long topwater flies, the jaws theme is always playing in my head Pike on the fly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NXj7tyJtto&feature=related  Hopefully I'll be able to post some of my own vids this year!!"

I don't really fly fish, but I do fish for pike with flies.   Tied a bunch recently and really looking forward to trying them out.  Cheers!"
