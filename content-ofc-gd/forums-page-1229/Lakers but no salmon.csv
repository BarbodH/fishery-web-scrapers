63628,bucktail,2007-04-23 12:26:00,1857,"Launched out of Port Dalhousie and fished form the shipping canal down to the river mouth and back. Fishing was VERY slow. Water was its warmest at the shipping canal, a balmy 43 degrees and coolest near the river a chilly 38. I noticed at the leaderboard at the ramp that there have been no salmon weighed in, too early still with this late spring. Should be hopping in another 2 weeks. Managed to go 2/3 with two lakers in the 13lb mark. We also lost a 4-5 brown near the shipping canal.  All fish came on purple tail dancers and reef runners behind the boards.  A couple grey ghosts.  Johnny first laker ever!   Bretts fish     Saturday morning out of Bronte was a bust. VERY clear and cold water leads to no fish in the spring. Here is a picture i took in 20 feet of 38 degree water. Until we get an onshore wind and some temperature and water colour I recommend avoiding Bronte for a few days   Clear Water  "
