63244,JFR,2007-04-22 11:37:00,498,"Sweet looking ribs. What type of smoker did you use?  I assembled and cured a new Char Griller Smokin' Pro yesterday, and today I plan on doing a spatchcocked chicken and a rack of beef back ribs.  Must be the warm weather, yesterday at Cdn Tire, there was a steady stream of people with new  gass grills.  John"
63246,JFR,2007-04-22 11:58:00,498,"Sweet looking ribs there Silveradosheriff. Kinda early in the AM, ribs for breakfast, that would be a first. What kind of smoker did you use? Your time of cooking, 4.5 hours, did you by chance foil the ribs at any time?"
63322,silveradosheriff,2007-04-22 17:38:00,1025,The Smoker/Cooker used was the big green egg (www.biggreenegg.com) with a BBQ Guru air control system (http://www.thebbqguru.com). Ribs are cooked using indirect heat with the aid of a plate setter.  Grill temp is set just under 200 with soaked maple chips applied to the lump charcoal.  Low and Slow Baby!
