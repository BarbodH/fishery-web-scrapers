63401,misfish,2007-04-22 21:59:00,29133,"Thank you for this bud................................................................   To know me! I am a fisherman for life. I will always be a fisherman. It's not something I do; it's who I am. Fishing is not an escape. It is where I belong, where I am supposed to be. It is not a place, but a life long journey. It is a passage my grandfather showed me, and I will show others. When you understand all of this, You will know me, and we will fish together."
