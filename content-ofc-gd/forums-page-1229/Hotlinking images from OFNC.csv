We don't mind so much if you hotlink to items in the Gallery, since it carries our copyright and URL on the watermark. But when you use the upload feature here to directly post an image and then hotlink to it on another site, it uses up quite a bit of bandwidth and we're starting to get closer to our upper limit. So, please be kind and use the gallery if you are going to use the images elsewhere. IF the problem continues we may have to look at ways to either block hotlinking of uploaded files or (worse case scenario) disable uploading and force the use of the gallery."
