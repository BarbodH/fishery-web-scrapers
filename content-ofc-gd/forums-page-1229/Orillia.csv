63350,Fisherman,2007-04-22 20:09:00,7201,"Nice pile of boats ut there today, by 7:30am there were over 50, after that, lost count. Tried to take pictures of the fish, camera was too small, I would have had to take 2 pictures and glue them together to show the true size.  It was a very good day to say the least."
63422,tbayboy,2007-04-22 23:03:00,1497,"Was out there as well helping Lexxington test drive his new boat (basically I was there to take the blame if it caught fire, exploded and sank to the bottom of the lake).  Certainly was a parking lot but the fishing wasn't bad - non stop lunkers like this guy  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/469054295_900f3fcb32.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""The big one"" /></a>  And then of course the worlds greatest sport fish made an appearance  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/469041962_fcad65cd43.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""Thats not a perch"" /></a>  In between we managed to do a pretty good job filling the new live well with some real keepers (and a few jumbos even).  In fact I just finished eating mine mmmmm good perch.  Oh and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the first mate.  Man does this dog like fishing  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/469054631_d1a77f4888_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""This dog loves to fish"" /></a>  No tagded perch though, guess I'm gonna have to pay for my gear after all"
63428,Rizzo,2007-04-22 23:18:00,4754,nice pic's.  With the great weather I'd imagine it was a zoo out there
63547,gellers,2007-04-23 02:44:00,7,We were also out there today.  What a fabulous day.  Certainly better weather this year for the opening weekend of the Perch derby than it has been for a number of years.
63618,fishboy,2007-04-23 12:02:00,550,Looks like a great day to be out.
63649,lilkynan,2007-04-23 13:18:00,173,"Got the boat out of wraps at 9 am - started - tested out and loaded on the road for 11 am.  Had the wife (Trying just to tan), and the two kids. Launched at noon, and back at 2. Got 24 over 12"" to 14"" - nice feed.  Kids did all the catching -  So much nicer living in Barrie and only having to drive from 5 minutes to Kemp Bay and 1/2 hour to Orillia.  We were the white IO bayliner - seemed to be the only one out there with a VHF radio - what up with that?  And Turkey starts in 2 days!!!!"
63655,misfish,2007-04-23 13:36:00,29133,I believe I seen you guys roll in to the launch. The wife and I were down for a walk.  Sounds like you got a great catch.  Yes it is nice to have the launch only minutes away from the drive.
