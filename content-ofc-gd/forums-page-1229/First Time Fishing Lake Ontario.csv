63413,Dondorfish,2007-04-22 22:37:00,1000,"Well - I finally made it out onto Lake Ontario fishing. We went out of St. Catharines Marina. I saw Fishmasters charter boat - nice outfit!  We headed out to about the 35 - 40 foot mark and headed towards the mighty Niagara. Fishing was really slow but we marked quite a few fish. After throwing pretty much everything we had at them - I managed to pick up this one as we made our turn to head back up towards St. Catharines. It weighed an even 13 lbs.       That was pretty much it and as we got back to St. Catharines, we were starting to pack up   when this guy hit. It weighed in at 9.4 lbs.        Before you jump all over me about the way we were holding the fish - we knew that we were going release the fish as fast as possible so we combined weigh in time with photo time - thus getting them back in the water as fast as possible.  Hope you enjoyed my afternoon out - I know I did!   Don"
63415,Carp,2007-04-22 22:51:00,1488,Beauty trout tracker. Congrats on your return to the best fishing in Ontario.  L. Ontario is my favourite spot to fish. All species possible and they grow to massive sizes.
63417,Smokey,2007-04-22 22:52:00,1278,"Nice fish, congrats on a great outing."
63429,irishfield,2007-04-22 23:19:00,26272,GREAT stuff Don!  And don't worry about the hold...you can't do worse than the charter boat and TV pro's I saw today...throwing them on the floor and torpedoing them back to nature.

63605,ccmtcanada,2007-04-23 11:35:00,7971,Nice job!  Must have felt good being back out in the big water and hauling some nice ones in.
63611,bpsbassman,2007-04-23 11:48:00,941,"Way to go Don.  You did better than us.  ""SKUNKO""  Funny that Carp didn't mention that We counted 42 boats around Jordan Harbour and never saw a fish.  Saw Steve from Hamilton and even he got skunked.  Not one fish entered for our Toonie Tourney. Was great to be out though and had a great day enjoying Carp's company."
63620,Mike the Pike,2007-04-23 12:09:00,3421,WTG Don good to see you catching them after 20yrs.No skunk for you.Nice lakers I hope to catch my first one next weekend.  I can supply the Timmies for Muskie fishing  MTP
