Unfortunatley, at the launch was after the boat was in the water and we were loaded to drive away.  Better late then never I guess.  Couple questions.  How do you clean the carpet and will my boat batter charger dry out?"
63552,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-23 03:22:00,212,That would be my battery inverter
63577,Greencoachdog,2007-04-23 08:44:00,8163,Been there done that!  Open all of your storage compartments and everything will dry out better. I like to use the spray foam automotive carpet and upholstery cleaner for my boat carpet.
63616,fishboy,2007-04-23 12:01:00,550,So how much water did you take on?  I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone here who hasn't done that or left the lights plugged in or forgot the net or....
63650,lilkynan,2007-04-23 13:21:00,173,Yup - done it once during my first year with the boat - sitting at fishermans pier under the skyway - star the boat up and my daughter says   Daddy - why is there water coming out of the motor???   Gotta do it once to remember always
63663,Uncle Buck,2007-04-23 13:54:00,1000, Ditto except i was swearing like a madman...
63743,SlowPoke,2007-04-23 16:44:00,2984,No plug problems for me on the maiden voyage... 1 in the hole and 2 in the toolbox. I did however forget the paddles at home!
