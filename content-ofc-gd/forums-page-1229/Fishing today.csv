63214,xrap,2007-04-22 03:57:00,683,Went out fishing today in search of cats and crappies but didn't have much luck. We had a few hits here and thier but we decided to pack up and try another spot. After getting skunded on crappies We decided to try the last resort. After bassmaster4 landing some small cats and my brother in law as well. I hooked into a bit bigger fish. It fought pretty good and when it came close to shore I was quite surprised to find out it was a bowfin. It was a beatiful day for fishing but they weren't bitting to well. Later we packed up and went to bassproshops and picked up a bunch of stuff. Here's a few shots from today.   Bassmaster4 with a small kitty on   Me trying to land the bowfin after the fight   Landed bowfin
