63198,terzaghi,2007-04-22 03:07:00,12,I purchased three seats for my boat over a year ago. the seats all have the standard swivel base on them and the swivel is removable. I want to mount a seat on the front. Below the front there is a waterproof compartment that I would like to keep water proof. The only way I can see to get this seat mounted is to use self tapping screws. I don't think this method would hold up to years of wear and tear. Anyone have any advice?

They are screwed to the aluminum seat and haven't had a problem yet. Been there since the boat was new in 2005, not that many years true, but they hold my weight so that says something!  Link website picture of sure mount seat bracket  You can buy these brackets at most marine dealers, some tackle shops and I think BPS has them too."

The integrity of your waterproof compartment will depend on installation procedures, use lotsa high grade marine grade silicone caulk in any drilled holes and on your fasteners too!  If thats aluminum, I'd recommend stainless steel machine screws with loc-nuts and a reinforcing plate or plates on the underside. If it's plywood I'd use Stainless star nuts... and then there's always good ol' Construction Adhesive!"
