The sticker on the motor says - some boats do not have adequate wiring for trolling motors, this powerful.  The wiring from the batteries to the motor should be 6 gauge or larger, and must be must be fused with a 50 amp maual reset circuit breaker.  Since I am wiring illiterate, can someone explain that in ""Wiring For Dummies"" language please.??    Pam"
63337,outdoorguy61,2007-04-22 18:50:00,220,Hello Pam In very short form....bigger stranded wires hold current and heat better. This becomes more important the longer the distance. Having a fuse helps a lot.....bigger is better as a general rule.  outdoorguy61
63360,sonny,2007-04-22 20:20:00,511,"Bigger is better as a general rule for the wire NOT FOR THE FUSE!!!,,,,Please use recommended fuses for the size gauge wire being used,,,a circuit breaker is the same as a fuse but is reusable where a fuse is not!"
63362,taper,2007-04-22 20:25:00,611,It is always best to have the fuse or circuit breaker as close to the battery as possible.
63371,GbayGiant,2007-04-22 20:34:00,1780,"I just simply have a in-line 50amp manual circuit breaker hooked on the positive lead and than the breaker is hooked directly onto the battery, works great it has saved my motor twice already and you just hit the little button on the breaker to rest it if it blows."
63406,pameladallaire,2007-04-22 22:06:00,470,Thank you guys.  I'll see if I can do it.  Your comments help a lot.   Pam
