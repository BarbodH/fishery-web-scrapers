Lanched the boat and headed towards Jordan. We fished a lot of water, moving around and trying to find some action. We covered water from Jordan to the Welland Canal.  It was a fantastic day on the water. With a combination of wind burn and the sun we were a little red. With the tips of the ears on fire, thankfully I wore a hat that at one time flew off and we had to turn around and go get it.  Trying a bit deeper water we were lucky to land one small fish. For a Friday with the sun out and being able to get out on the water, I could not have asked for a better day. (fish aside).  Thanks for the day Sonny, Looking forward to the next trip.  Easton"
