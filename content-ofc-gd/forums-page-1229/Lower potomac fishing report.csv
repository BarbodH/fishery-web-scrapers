63485,Daplumma,2007-04-23 01:02:00,1961,"Art and I went down to the boat to repair the exhaust line on the port motor.The repair went well and was done in time to take a run out to the river for a little catfishing.The lower Potomac is famed for its huge cats.Art had his buddy at the seafood market save all of the shad guts and heads for bait and I brought a few tubs of chicken liver.Got this little blue cat on some chicken liver,never caught a blue cat on the upper Potomac where we usually fish.  We set up off of this point in a creek bed for cats or Stripers with shad cut bait and a line out with a liver.  No stripers,they seem to have vacated the Potomac and are well on their way to the Bay by now but the season just opened this weekend.This Channell cat did co-operate and got us a few catfish inches..Go team 6!  Lots of little cats around 16 to 20 inches but no real monsters.Tons of floating wood and trees in the water from high tides and rain last week.There will be many more inches of cats as soon as we learn the ways of the lower Potomac but it wasn't all bad 75+ degrees and I got a sunburn!!All fish were returned,I cant quite bring myself to eat catfish from water that has flowed past the city! Joe"

All in all a great day in the boat and a few places checked out and 1000's more to go to on the river. Sorry Joey I'll try to get more than an arm in the picture after we get rid of the winter whiteness ...a Cajun without a tan just ain't right.  Art
