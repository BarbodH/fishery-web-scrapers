It was a great experience for me and im sure ill be heading down there some time soon. I had a limited amount of money to spend and i didnt end up getting all that much but i was very satisfied. I purchased some laser sharp circle hooks, Mustad treble hooks, an X-Rap lure in perch color , a Mepps Spinner in Red with Yellow spots, Mustad baithooks in red, and Gamakatsu hooks. I was in awe of the aquarium they have in Bass Pro Shops in Vaughn. They have some real lunkers in there!   These waders i recieved today are brand new never been used before.   They are chest waders, the company that makes them is called Waders Edge. It is my first pair of waders and they look real good. I am very anxious to use them.  Well here are the pics. Enjoy  Big Mama Bass     Nice Rainbow Trout up close (sure is good to have zoom)     Here is a better view of THE BIG BASS    Rainbow Trout and some Crappie    Channel Cat    Some more Trout (dont know if u can see them)    Now for the waders dont mind the picture on the left dont know if anyone noticed it LOL thats from like 4 years ago when i was 10  but anyway here they are    and heres the logo   Thanks for viewing!"
