This is my first time taking in an engine for repair, any ideas what the ballpark $ would be? Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions."
63802,Zib,2007-04-23 18:43:00,369,Generally your looking at around $75/hr for labor plus parts. They usually bump the price of the parts up at least 35% of their cost.
63830,Ned Devine,2007-04-23 20:24:00,13,I took my 30 Hp Evinrude to Uxbridge Small Engines and the service and costs were very good.  I would recommend them.  (905) 852-5884.  Good Luck.
