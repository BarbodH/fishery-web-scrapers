63562,Tacklebuster,2007-04-23 03:48:00,303,"just curious, how long it takes you guys to clean you limit of perch?"
63571,GbayGiant,2007-04-23 04:15:00,1780,To long.  Let's just say it's easier to catch them than it is to prep and cook a nice meal.   I don't keep them anymore unless they are serious jumbos.
63573,Sinker,2007-04-23 04:46:00,8692,"I don't usually keep a limit. I like to have around 20-30, and I""m good to go. Takes me about an hour  from the time I start, until they are either in the pan, or prepared for the freezer. That includes clean up....everything.  Sinker"
63574,Jen,2007-04-23 04:46:00,833,"It really depends on :  If you have one of those descaler buckets that I saw in a post somewhere, Skin on or off - see above, as if you leave it on that little toy would be mighty nice and if your three children are all HELPING- if that is the case, plan on an entire day.  It is all worth it in the end!  Cheers,  Jen"
63575,ch312,2007-04-23 05:09:00,1590,electric fillet knives make it ALOT faster and you waste less meat...
63580,Clampet,2007-04-23 09:59:00,1947,"35 Perch took me about 2hrs, that is deboned (cutting around the rib cage) and skinned, washed and packaged. This was done with a 4"" blade. "
63585,Terry,2007-04-23 10:28:00,14456,well for me it takes more then a year to clean 50 perch...cause it take more then a year for me to bring that many home...lol
63615,fishboy,2007-04-23 11:57:00,550,I'm guessing about 2 minutes a fish.
63617,Mike the Pike,2007-04-23 12:02:00,3421,It takes me 1 hour to clean 15 perch .I have never caught my limit.I am still slow when cleaning fish but I am getting better.  MTP
63623,Roy,2007-04-23 12:19:00,13728,What Terry said...
63625,Fishmaster,2007-04-23 12:20:00,920,50 perch 1 1/2 hrs scaled bonesless butterflys ...i use a elec scaler and elec knife ...
63627,MJL,2007-04-23 12:24:00,2427,"It used to take me an hour to clean 20 perch till I figured out it was easier to get somebody else to do it - ie the wife (or girlfriend) but may also include neighbours, parents, really really good friends, etc  It's enough ""punishment"" getting sunburned, dealing with adverse weather conditions, driving to and from the lake, waking up at 4am Saturday morning so you don't have to wait for people to launch their boat when you get there.  One of the greatest discoveries of my fishing career  I enjoy my naps between the time I come back from the water and dinner/lunch  EDIT  Ladies who fish, perhaps you might be able to get your husband/boyfriend/life partner to do it - unlikely - But worth a try"
63631,Guest mistyriver1,2007-04-23 12:30:00,0,2 minutes per fish.
63637,just2manylures,2007-04-23 12:50:00,144,5 hours 47 mins 21 sec
63638,Steelcat,2007-04-23 12:52:00,191,"With my brother's help, 30 perch took us 1 hour to filet (skinned).  We were still trying to figure out how to make this process faster."
63643,Beans,2007-04-23 13:10:00,3339,"My own personal, preffered limit is a dozen perch or crappie and it takes me at least a half to three quarters of an hour to fillet them...  I'm not good at it but Crappieperchhunter does a marvelous job of cleaning them..."
