61801,eyefish,2007-04-18 21:38:00,135,"This is what was missing in my article.    """"without feeling any resistance while at the same time allowing you to feel the strike.  In almost all cases when bottom fishing, floating bait is used. The most effective presentation is a roe bag with a couple of pieces of styrofoam tied in it to keep the bait off the bottom.  Hooks  Now this is where you can run into some problems. There are many types and sizes of hooks used to catch fish. With trout you want to use a smaller hook. Anywhere from a number 10 to a number 16 octopus hook depending on water clarity. The cleaner the water the smaller the hook you should use.  Leaders  A leader is a section of line smaller in diameter than the main line. Leaders are used when the water is clean. These can be attached anywhere on your setup with a small swivel. When float fishing, the leader is tied just under the float. Leaders serve 2 purposes. The first would be allowing you to break off on a snag below your float saving you money. The second allows you to change your line diameter in clear water conditions. The most effective leader material would be fluorocarbon. Fluorocarbon and steelhead fishing go hand in hand and is perfect for clear water situations due to its low light reflectivity and strength at small line diameters.  Baits  There are many types of bait that can be used to catch steelhead. Some of which are roe, worms, small crank baits, small marabou jigs, flies and even micro tubes. While I have caught steelies on all these baits, I would have to say that my winter bait of choice would have to be roe.  The most important part of steelhead fishing hands down is matching bait to water conditions. When waters are high and dirty, a very large, very bright presentation is the only way to go. On the other hand"""
