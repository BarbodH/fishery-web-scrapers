Having observed the cuts to MNR and having a mixed reaction to them, I am taking this recent development as Martha Stewart would put it....as....a ""good thing"". Goodbye Leah.  It is my hope that this change will begin to bridge a management- staff gap that in my opinion has done nothing to serve the taxpayer and everything to ensure poor service and questionable policys, management. It never makes the paper and always seems to be a quiet conversation, less one risk a strike or more typical a work disruption, which can come in many forms. Hopefully, this will see a new beginning that will see some dollars invested and in turn get a more responsive employee bang for the proverbial tax dollar.  I would like MNR to be a proactive, dynamic organization and be a leader in Canada when it comes to fish, wildlife and resource management. I wish the new gentleman well and hope he is progressive in worker- managment relations. The former leader was archaic, with too much of a destructive tendency to be viewed as workable....in my opinion based upon what was observed across the province.  Just a note from someone that is actually still interested in the outdoors be it work or as a volunteer....despite the sillyness. OPSEU has made a good move and will hopefully benifit with better relations to help us all.  outdoorguy61"
