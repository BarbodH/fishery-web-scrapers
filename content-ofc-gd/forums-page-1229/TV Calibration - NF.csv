63777,boatman,2007-04-23 18:00:00,350,Sorry - not fishing related.  I know there are some audio/videophiles here. Anyone ever have their rear projection CRT TV calibrated? I have a 4 year old Toshiba 50H82 that I’m considering having serviced. I understand that these TV’s should be serviced after 100 hours and that the re-calibration can make a big improvement. Anyone have any experience or comments about it? Also any recommendations for a good service tech in Hamilton would be appreciated.

I know there are a few different calibration discs that help you optomize on your own. Here's a link that might help you. http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread....13037&& . Here's another to one of the calibration discs that some of the hardcore guys use http://www.calibrate.tv/patterns/patterns.html . Here's a link to a review on IMHO a ""more user friendly"" calibration disc http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_6_2/aviadvd.html . Hope that helped."

63845,Gerritt,2007-04-23 20:54:00,6129,I have had my old ProJo recalibrated more then once it is not that expensive to be honest... the bill was about 150.00 bux not to shabby! But I didnt have to pay for it... I took the extended warranty through FutureShop and it was paid for by them.  Here is the outfit that paid me a visit and they were courteous and professional   http://www.coltech.ca/   PS. a good calibration job makes the TV like new!  Gerritt.
