Although I'm pretty sure that I won't be able to see anything when close to 100FOW, I don't mind since I won't be doing that very often anyways. On the very first trip I took it out, it seemed to work flawlessly, and I could see my jig going down 20ft easily. Only problem was that I lost track of the swivel after about 7' of going down. I still haven't been able to play around with everything as the fish were already on at the time and there was no time to fool around  So when I come home to actually play around with it, it starts to act all wonky, but I'm not sure if this is right. I can place the transducer into a 5 gallon bucket filled with water, which is about 1.5FOW only, but it returns back something along the lines of 5' to 10'. The depths seem to constantly jump around. And when I put down a jig into it to play around (right under the transducer), it is not visible on the fishfinder. Only when I place my hand under the transducer will something be picked up, and even then the display looks like it's weeds.  Is it that I am putting the transducer in a small space that it's getting the wrong readings, or has something gone wrong with the fishfinder?  Thanks guys, I know this might be just a case of not having enough time to play with the finder while out on the ice."

438663,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-01 19:11:00,0,get any hits in that bucket?
438665,EC1,2010-03-01 19:39:00,930," Wish I did! Kinda sad that I only went out on the ice once when I had an entire week off school! So it comes down to fishing down a bucket!  And thanks cram, I think I'm just gonna put it away and wait for the ice this coming weekend."
