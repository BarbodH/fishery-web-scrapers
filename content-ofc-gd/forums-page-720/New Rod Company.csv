437590,mbac31,2010-02-27 00:01:00,904,"Boyd Duckett Introduces New Rod Company Classic winner ""re-assembles"" award-winning design team; Introduces rods that will utilize microguide technology  DEMOPOLIS, Alabama -- Boyd Duckett, the 2007 Bassmaster Classic champion and one of the top professional anglers on the ESPN BASS Elite Series tour, announced today that he has established an Alabama-based company that will produce innovative, high-end fishing rods that introduce microguide technology. The new company, Duckett Fishing LLC, will manufacture rods that were created and tested by industry-leading designers and professional anglers. The ultra-lightweight rods -- called ""MicroMagic"" -- offer unmatched sensitivity and, because of the rods' microguides, will allow anglers to significantly increase their casting distance and accuracy, Duckett said. Duckett will use MicroMagic rods competitively beginning in February at the 2010 Bassmaster Classic. He added that other pro anglers will soon join Duckett Fishing's professional staff. ""I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about this venture. What we're doing at Duckett Fishing is making rods that take existing technology to a whole new level. What we've done with microguides is extremely special and ahead of the curve. We developed these rods by getting a lot of input from custom rod builders who know what they're doing. Then we combined that with the best kind of research and development -- on the water testing by pro anglers,"" Duckett said. ""Our company slogan is, ""Driven by pros, not by profits.' What that means is that our rods were developed literally by and for pros, so people who buy this rod will be getting a rod that professionals built and like. I'll be fishing with them in the Classic. But the second part of this is that our decisions won't be ""corporate-style"" decisions. We don't intend to cut corners and offer an inferior product. We're committed to producing rods that truly help anglers."" Duckett Fishing was incorporated earlier this month and is based in Demopolis, Alabama. Duckett is the only BASS Elite Series angler to ever start and manage a major fishing products company. Duckett said the rods will be available online through the company Web site, www.duckettfishing.com. Next year the rods will be available in retails stores. As he established the new company, Duckett re-assembled the development team that created the award-winning prototype for Carrot Stix fishing rods, popular, light-weight orange rods. Duckett and designer Ken Whiting were instrumental in the initial development and branding success attributed to Carrot Stix. Earlier this year, however, Duckett severed ties with the manufacturer and distributor of Carrot Stix: Toronto, Canada-based E-21. Duckett split with E-21 primarily because of what he described in a July 2009 news release as concerns ""about the general quality of the rods being made and how warranties are being honored."" In splitting with E-21, Duckett stated that the rods weren't being produced as they were initially designed. The split with E-21 prompted Duckett's decision to create his own company. Whiting and E-21 executive Sean Schuyler have joined Duckett at Duckett Fishing. ""This is the right thing to do. We have assembled a terrific team, and we're hitting the ground running. We'll have some exciting announcements over the next few months,"" Duckett said. ""But what is so significant is we finally have full control of quality and production and can offer the public innovation that's not purely profit driven."" The 2010 Bassmaster Classic will be held in February on Lay Lake, near Birmingham, Alabama. Duckett won the 2007 Classic, which was also held on Lay Lake. ""It will be pretty special to be using these new rods at Lay Lake during the greatest fishing tournament in the world,"" Duckett said. ""I can't over-emphasize how terrific it is to be working with the folks who are coming to Duckett Fishing, and I promise that we will work as hard as we can work to produce and deliver exceptional rods. Our goal is to offer anglers state-of-the-art technology that gives them an advantage on the water."" Although he had spent more than 20 years fishing competitively, Duckett burst onto the national stage in 2007 when he won the Bassmaster Classic and the Bassmaster Legends, a ""major"" tournament. That year, Duckett set a single-season BASS earnings record. He also won the title at the 2007 Ultimate Match Fishing competition, a made-for-television event featured on the Outdoor Channel. In addition to Duckett Fishing, Duckett also owns a successful product-transport business: Southern Tank Leasing, an Alabama-based enterprise that delivers products in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest."
437596,Syn,2010-02-27 00:14:00,519,"I was wondering how microguides would work on spinning rods and the answer is here http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmas...ea_micro-guides  ""Micro guide technology is also applicable to spinning rods, although only from about the mid-point to the tip. Longer casts aren't necessarily a benefit here, but increased smoothness, sensitivity, balance and weight reduction are."""
437619,solopaddler,2010-02-27 00:40:00,8605,I don't see the advantage in micro guides. If you actually put these guides on a scale the weight difference is negligible compared to more standard titanium frame guides. I just don't buy the claim that casting distance won't be affected either even if you're only talking micros from mid point to tip.  Besides they look gay.
437627,mbac31,2010-02-27 00:49:00,904, just anther fad. Go with the flow kinda thing.
437649,archie_james_c,2010-02-27 01:10:00,618,Wouldn't mind checkin them out...not for the stupid micro guides but just because they're a nice lookin fishin pole!
437684,jace,2010-02-27 02:03:00,472,"  I built a micro spinning rod for a friend last year and he didn't let go of it for the last month of vacation.  I wasn't so sure it would be a good idea with a spinning reel and sic guides going from 25 down to 3 micros and a fuji titanium concept tip, guides were set up as new concept.   I've got casting rods and i thought they were great.  I was skeptical at first also. Without the bigger/heavier guides on the light ends, you can feel the responsiveness of the blank alone.  It's almost like the difference between casting a high graphite rod and a fiberglass composite rod like an ugly stick.  At the end of the cast, the rod tip will continue whipping down on the heavy composite rod.  you don't get so much on a decent blank, and you get even less with micros on the same blank.  the only real drawback are for people who cast knots.  I don't think it's a gimmick.  this one is here to stay just as concept did, which was a similar departure from the rods before them with high legged spinning and casting guides all the way to the tip.   Any spinning or casting rod today that starts with double foot and goes down to single foot fly guides to the tip can thank fuji concept for that."
437686,BillM,2010-02-27 02:06:00,17367,"Soon we won't even have guides, it will just be one solid carbon fiber tapered cylinder from the cork to the tip.  You'll also be able to cast 2.45 miles with 1/4oz tube jigs."
437693,solopaddler,2010-02-27 02:31:00,8605," That's been done before, Daiwa came out with rods like that years ago."
437702,Syn,2010-02-27 02:57:00,519, oh yeah I remember that. I wondered how did they thread the line all the way down the blank. Seemed really hard to do.
437718,jace,2010-02-27 03:59:00,472,"  Daiwa Interline rods.   They still make them.   There are 2 other manufacturers of that design that i've seen.  One makes super heavy saltwater rods that resemble a compound bow with a solid back half and a flexible limb tube on the front half. I forget the other brand, it's not one of the well known companies.   Syn...they come with a looped cable."
437726,mbac31,2010-02-27 04:25:00,904,Daiwa Interline rods I still have 4 of them. Silver color and very nice rods. The came with a threader(looper) for threading the line in them.
437744,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-27 08:05:00,158,"All about product and not profit... Right... Sounds like a good business plan...  I wonder how long it will be before a little MADE IN CHINA sticker will be on them.   Yes it is definately a fad, but it may be one that sticks around.  I say its a fad, because it is only available of expensive stuff high end stuff."
437746,Ben_Daniels,2010-02-27 08:59:00,435,LOL  Thats tooo funny
437754,singingdog,2010-02-27 12:24:00,1047,"I have a spinning rod with micro guides and it absolutly rocks. I don't notice much difference in casting distance, but the difference in feel is dramatic. I would say that putting micro guides on a blank is almost as good as buying the next better blank with traditional guides on it."
437764,solopaddler,2010-02-27 13:15:00,8605,  Really?  Micro guides are the ones pictured on the right:  
437767,Spiel,2010-02-27 13:17:00,9065,You want me to order some in for you Mike?  Personally I'll put them right up there with split rear grips.
437770,solopaddler,2010-02-27 13:28:00,8605,"  Split grip with micro guides, my dream rod."
438047,singingdog,2010-02-28 12:40:00,1047, Yep. It's a custom build. Several builders in the Southeast states have been using them on spinning rods with very good luck. Mine is built on a St Croix SCIII blank. The difference in feel is dramatic.
438096,pike slayer,2010-02-28 15:33:00,1177,"http://duckettfishing.com/home.php  they are some ugggly rods! white and red? really? looks like those 70s canadian tire rods you find in someones basement covered in dust. but it sounds like a good idea with the smaller guides, i'd like to try one out to see for sure and get some actual reviews on them. and the prices are outrageous for a "" high end"" ""professional"" rod"
438272,archie_james_c,2010-02-28 21:43:00,618,"  149$ is ""outrageous""? Outragously cheap or???"
438277,pike slayer,2010-02-28 21:47:00,1177,my bad! they arent outrageous for something high end.
