438269,joonmoon,2010-02-28 21:35:00,528,Bench Heatly. He's not on his game and he's gonna cost more bad than good.
438270,joonmoon,2010-02-28 21:37:00,528,Pronger's gotta be more aggressive and use his size.
438273,Rich Clemens,2010-02-28 21:44:00,3131,2 - 1 end of 2.   I sure hope this one goal will pick up the USA team.   Sure looks like a fast paced game.
438278,steverowbotham,2010-02-28 21:48:00,1800,Canada's misplaying the puck a lot this game.  Going to be a nerve racking 3rd period
438279,Grimace,2010-02-28 21:49:00,2020,"The first time they played,  Canada had a bad game and the States made them pay.  This time Canada is playing good and the States are right there with them.  This game is living up to the hype as far as I am concerned and the rugged battles that are being fought and won by both teams is to me the epitome of hockey.  2-1 Canada after 2.  I hope the 3rd gets even better.  Both goalies playing well and both teams playing well.  It does not get better than this.   Nothing worse than a championship game that ends up in a blow out because 1 team folds.  Go Canada!!!!"
