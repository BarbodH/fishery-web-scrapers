385549,Tay690,2009-09-21 18:35:00,8,"Hi there, I am new to this website...and what a gold mine!  I am an avid fisherman and have been since I was about 6 years old (Grandpa taught me everything he knew)  I mainly fish for bass specifically (At least that's what I know in and out) but will fish for anything that will put up an awesome fight  I live in the GTA and am looking for someone who is as obsessed if not more obsessed with fishing than I am to go fishing with.  Any time...any place  Work - Monday to Thursday (Friday saturday sunday off every week)  I know it's late in the season to be asking but I'm hoping to make some solid connections for next year possibly...or even some fall Walleye fishing  Thanks in advance, Sincerely Taylor"

I have fished and or met with a few OFC members and each time out it's been fun and or a learning exp. I'm out in Durham if you are ever out this way feel free to msg me, cheers."
392567,Tay690,2009-10-13 18:06:00,8,Definiately will I usually just shore fish by myself...I have a few people with boats that don't mind provided we go up to their lake etc  I enjoy river fishing and plugging away for bass with topwater mostly (my personal favourite lol)
