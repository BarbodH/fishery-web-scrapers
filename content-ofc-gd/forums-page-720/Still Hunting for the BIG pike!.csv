Well known for his gar pike abilities. but thats just another story!  we start the day at 7:30 ish.  while setting up my first tip-up.  i feel something pulling........ set the hook on a 4 + smallie!    I knew we were set up in the right erea.  around a big point. stnading on variouse weed beds.    as we are playing around with the smallies.  robs line start to scream.  sets the hook and a sweet 2 minute fight gets him his first pike of the day.    this one tops 10.4 lbs then its my turn.    we release the 10 and keep this 3 lbs pike for super.  after this the pike bite slowed down but the smallies were everywere.  punch a hole and there they were 2-3 of them stacked.    this pig hit a jig head tipped with a minnow.    thanks to rj i was able to play with his spare vex!  Yes his 'spare'' vex.  finaly rob had the horse shoe up his  landing this sweet pike... but we had trouble landing him..... quick strike doubled hook this northern.    not deep and still fully energetic we snap a quick pic and release the beauty!    was nice meeting you rob!  oh yeah btw MOOSEBUNK pphone  while we were fishing. asking how the day was going!  next time moose just tag along with us.  you ARE the pike master!
