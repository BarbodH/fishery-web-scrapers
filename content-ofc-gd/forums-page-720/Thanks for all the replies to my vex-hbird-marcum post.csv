438572,trapshooter,2010-03-01 13:19:00,1234,Watch out with the 2 cables going to the transducer..... sometimes the wrong one takes the weight of the 'ducer and causes it to sit unlevel (and you won't mark properly).  I ended up removing the support cable altogether.
438584,Jds63,2010-03-01 13:48:00,1365,  yeah ...listen to Ben it really does make a difference ... i have the ice 45 and its great
