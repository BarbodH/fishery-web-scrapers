438642,bigfish1965,2010-03-01 17:43:00,3382,Whirlpool is shore fishing only. If i were you I would either go with a guide the first time or take someone with lots of experience. That river is nothing to mess with and has areas that are EXTREMELY dangerous. But it holds more fish per square inch  than most anywhere else in this area.
