437915,trevy727,2010-02-27 23:28:00,351,"Just sitting around this afternoon and thought I would draw. Ended up with the picture bellow and thought to myself that this might be nice on the back of a t-shirt with maybe my name on the front. Then I got thinking of maybe doing a whole series of Canadian ""FISH"" Fishereman...eg, walleye, trout, pike, musky etc.....I was just wondering, would anyone else be interested in my idea? Any suggestions or orders? I have no idea what it would cost to print onto a t-shirt but I do have a friend in the printing industry. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks for looking.  "
