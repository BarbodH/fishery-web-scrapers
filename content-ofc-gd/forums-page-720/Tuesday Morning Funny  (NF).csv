Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.   She tried to take the step, only to discover that she couldn't  . So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step.  Once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg.  With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to take the step Finally, a large man standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.  She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and yelled,   'How dare you touch my body!   I don't even know who you are!' The man smiled and drawled, 'Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you,   but after you   unzipped my fly three times, I figured   we were friends.'"
