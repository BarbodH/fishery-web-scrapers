438556,solopaddler,2010-03-01 12:39:00,8605,"I'm looking to refurbish my SSV 16 this spring. The boat needs new decals, pin striping and paint. I've done a quick search and it doesn't seem readily available direct from Lund. Will I be forced to get decals and paint made to match? Has anyone done this before? If so I could use some help pointing me in the right direction.  Thanks!"
438557,Muskieman,2010-03-01 12:44:00,2472,I'm not sure about the paint ........ but for the decals you can go to almost any vinyl decal shop and they can make some for you... we have a guy here in Sturgeon Falls that does it...Thunder Signs and Graphics.  RFS

438585,aniceguy,2010-03-01 13:49:00,1094,"Mike send me an electronic form of the lund decal or the rough dimensions I have a friend who can do this,  As for paint , call Lund to get the paint code www.colorite.com you can order the cans directly and should either be OEM or so close no one will know."
438592,solopaddler,2010-03-01 14:15:00,8605,"Thanks guys. Lou, I'm not sure how I can possibly send you the exact dimensions of the logo?"
438619,irishfield,2010-03-01 16:17:00,26272,The paint is PPG... the decals are available thru a Lund dealer if you really need them back on! I have a full left side for a 2007 Baron...  The paint code chart is here somewhere Mike.. I posted it a couple years ago.  here..  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...int+codes\
438622,sirfish,2010-03-01 16:26:00,175,Most vinyl graphics places can do them for you....at a fraction of what Lund is going to charge you for the exact same thing. Cost me $40 for both sides -starcraft SS 16 Just measure total lenght and hieght of graphic and bring a pic of them...piece of cake.

438798,solopaddler,2010-03-02 01:58:00,8605,"Thanks for the input everyone, I've got what I need sourced out now."
