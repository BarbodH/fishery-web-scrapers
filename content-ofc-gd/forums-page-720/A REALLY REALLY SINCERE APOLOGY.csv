438738,greyhawk,2010-03-01 23:22:00,33,No doubt about it. BEST in the WORLD.
438742,johnnyb,2010-03-01 23:28:00,3413,"Hilarious post!! Just seeing it in it's entirety now.....  OH and of course, YAHOOOO CANADA!!!!"
438832,Cudz,2010-03-02 04:17:00,2652,Yeah!  Check under GWG category.  There is a 2 beside Crosby's name and 2 beside Jarome's name.  Hmm. Both guys are legit. Cream rises to the top.
438415,JohnAB,2010-03-01 00:17:00,178,"Anyone who doubts the Kid think again. Stanley Cup and Gold in the Olympics. Oh where has Ovechkin been lately!  And to all those who doubted our team and bad mouthed the players on the team like Toews, Perry et al, hope you are ashamed of yourselves!  And do not forget a good ole Saskatchewan boy who was coaching! Has a World Junior Gold, Stanley Cup and now an Olympic Gold. Way to go Mike! Plus he is a good outdoorsmen to boot. Brother in law is Rob from Noslers Magnum TV!"
438423,Twocoda,2010-03-01 00:28:00,4130, found him ....he was singing  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhHj5pXFBU&NR=1
438425,rob v,2010-03-01 00:29:00,535,Couldn't have written a better script.  Fantastic.
438429,Cudz,2010-03-01 00:42:00,2652,"By the way, Nice heads up pass by Iginla I heard Crosby call for the puck.  Jerome solid throughout.  I would have that guy on my team anyday."
438432,Handlebarz,2010-03-01 00:58:00,3790,I also think this might be just cause for a replay of this great moment in Summer games  
438444,Marty,2010-03-01 01:15:00,873,"Figures it took a kid who now lives in Pittsburgh to bring home the gold.  You Crosby haters crack me up. Two game winners (including the Gold winner) and you're still haters.   He may not have scored a ton of goals but he put others on the doorstep throughout these games. He took alot of big hits too.  He played very well.  Congrats to the Team Canada.  They deserved to win and I'm very happy for them.   I'm very proud of the Americans.  They weren't even supposed to medal.  Now, when does football season start."
438445,TJQ,2010-03-01 01:17:00,7806, Hey.. I may not have gotten a medal... but I was there!!!!!!
438449,Twocoda,2010-03-01 01:20:00,4130,   sorry dude ...my team aint in any hurry to give him up....just yet...
438472,Daplumma,2010-03-01 01:55:00,1961,"Congrats to Canada,they had the better team.TJ,you are a seriuos dummass,I can't believe how you temp fate.I will never be anywhere near you in a thunderstorm.Dumbass! Joe"
438489,smitter,2010-03-01 02:17:00,106,That was a game for the ages!  Our game forever!
438491,backbay,2010-03-01 02:25:00,773,"It might be our game, but it looks like we've done a pretty good job of sharing it! Congrats to our, and all, Olympians. Brilliant job!"
438536,tb4me,2010-03-01 04:47:00,3295,Who hooo!!! Go Canada!!
438542,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-01 06:31:00,0,what a game.  miller is incredible. aren't you crosby haters sick of being wrong all the time?

438653,Syn,2010-03-01 18:49:00,519,
438664,aplumma,2010-03-01 19:14:00,6896,Great Job to the Canadian Team and supporters. It was an awesome game and could not have been any closer. I guess we will use the next 4 years to bring even a bigger game stick to the Olympics next time we play Canada for the gold and silver.   Art
438669,TJQ,2010-03-01 19:50:00,7806,   NIIIIICCEE!!!
438677,capt bruce,2010-03-01 20:17:00,820,"It was a great game well played by both teams , We Canadians must not forget U.S. was youngest team at the games they will be back in 4 years , untill then we need to grow our Taylor Halls , John Tavares ,Stamkos  , etc if we want to repeat , was a great game played by two great teams ."
438679,kickingfrog,2010-03-01 20:21:00,8333, Seriously you did this again? What a Puckhead!
438680,TJQ,2010-03-01 20:38:00,7806, LOL.. I know I know.. im still hearing about this today...
438683,kickingfrog,2010-03-01 20:42:00,8333, Today? I plan on kicking your tail in June at Lakair!
438730,Flatbackdreamer,2010-03-01 22:56:00,17,Here's some stats from Team Canada for you guys.  Considering we didn't hear Crosby's name (which is why there's alot of doubter's out there) his stats look pretty good.   
438317,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-28 22:39:00,4399,  I don`t think T.J. will survive the trade dead line!!!!  No watching the OT for you go stand in the corner!!!
438319,Cudz,2010-02-28 22:39:00,2652,Is it sudden death?  Is it 4 on 4 or regular 5 on 5?
438320,vinnimon,2010-02-28 22:39:00,2593,I Think T J packed up and left
438321,vinnimon,2010-02-28 22:40:00,2593,I heard them say 4 on 4
438322,mbac31,2010-02-28 22:41:00,904,TJ has left the building.
438326,Twocoda,2010-02-28 22:42:00,4130,  good now we stand a chance...lmao
438327,TJQ,2010-02-28 22:45:00,7806,"LOL.. If you thing dealing with you guys is bad, lol.. ive been informed that neither mu wife nor kids is talking to me any more and I should find new ""accommodations...  ok gotta go and see if I get to stay in my own house!!"
438328,uglyfish,2010-02-28 22:48:00,981,"lol lets be honest TJ, thats prolly deserved... haha.  4 on 4 for 20 minutes of sudden death. then a 3 round shootout, if its still tied they can send anyone they want to shoot till its over...  they should just play overtime till someone scores though."
438332,TJQ,2010-02-28 22:53:00,7806,YA BABY!!!!!!   WHEW!!!!!!!

438347,uglyfish,2010-02-28 23:03:00,981,at least crosby finally did somethin useful!
438369,Stoty,2010-02-28 23:28:00,2910,"Crosby just pulled a Sundin.....invisible for most of the time, then scores the winning goal, and is now a hero! LOL  Gotta feel bad for Miller though, by far the tourny's MVP."
438370,brifishrgy,2010-02-28 23:28:00,559, didn't he win a cup with Pittsburgh last season??? and make it to the cup finals the season before??  I might be wrong
