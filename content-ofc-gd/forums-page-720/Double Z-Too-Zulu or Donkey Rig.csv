438129,Paully,2010-02-28 17:05:00,712,Thats a cool set up... I may try that with senkos. Perhaps 2 different colors and see which is more effective.
438164,msp,2010-02-28 18:07:00,1336,I have been farting around with this set up for a while now and I have found that when you hook 2 fish at the same time they seem to work against each other. Usually one fish gets off. I feel that its probably better to use a single setup and target the hungry fish individually.....1 at a time. the set up does look great in the water though.
