438625,bushart,2010-03-01 16:46:00,2628,I try not to be critical of those that have achieved a level I could not even in my prime.  I used to do my fair share of armchair qb'n but these guys have the talent that brought them to the top and I do not so it's hard to criticize  Now if Crosby goes fishin....it's on.  Alas nowadays the only way I'll own the podium is after last nights fire wagon chilli.  Bushart
438628,canadadude,2010-03-01 16:50:00,769,"Like I said in another thread it's time for me to eat crow, I was very unsure about this team from the begining but I'm more then happy I was sooooo wrong. The team really gelled together nicely and played great, except for the little brain farts in the last 60 seconds of semi and final games, perhaps they figured we needed a touch more drama lol.  As for Crosby. he's a Canadian hockey hero know matter what anyone says, he scored  one of the biggest goals in Canadian Hockey history and it couldn't of happened to a better person.At such a young age he has been a great ambasador of the sport and is a fine role model for so many young Canadian hockey fans. Things couldn't have worked out any better it truely was one of the most memorable hockey games in Canadian History."
438629,canadadude,2010-03-01 16:52:00,769,hahahahahah........I said that alot in my younger years
438333,joonmoon,2010-02-28 22:54:00,528,WOW
438338,bigfish1965,2010-02-28 22:54:00,3382,SYDNEY  for PM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
438349,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 23:06:00,8333,"Despite the outcome, I'm not a fan of the 4 on 4 for play-off type games."
438350,Terry,2010-02-28 23:07:00,14456,I didn't know I could hold my breath that long
438356,uglyfish,2010-02-28 23:16:00,981,  u and me both!! im now having a drink... so i can calm back down! lol
438357,uglyfish,2010-02-28 23:19:00,981,"the only bad part about that... was crosby getting the winning goal... now he'll be ;labelled as a hero and all that crap forever,... even though he was prolly the worst player on the ice all tourney long for canada.  and ryan miller... that guy put on a goaltending performance like nuthing i have ever seen before!"
438363,Joey,2010-02-28 23:25:00,9122,"Awesome game, start to finish.  On pins and needles the whole time.  Woohooooo"
438364,Grimace,2010-02-28 23:26:00,2020,Best Olympics ever.  Best hockey game ever.
438365,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 23:26:00,8333,"Now I remember why I stay away from the hockey stuff most of the time. Armchair experts.  Posted else where:  Clueless, if you're measuring a hockey player by goals and assists. Thank goodness you all didn't have a say in picking the team. Stick to fishin'."
438366,JohnAB,2010-02-28 23:26:00,178,Yeah baby! Canada gold medallists!
438372,Billy Bob,2010-02-28 23:29:00,5865,CONGRATULATIONS.....can't say we didn't make Canada work for it...and a NICE CEREMONY after the game.  Bob  now bring on SPRING....
438381,Rich Clemens,2010-02-28 23:38:00,3131,That was indeed a great game and what better way to play for the GOLD.    Congratulations to all of CANADA.
438382,uglyfish,2010-02-28 23:38:00,981,"  ill assume thats directed at me. which is fine.  i never claimed to be an expert. but i do know the game of hockey. i never said crosby wasnt a good player, or didnt deserve to be on the team. im simply pointing out that that goal will over shadow the game played by other players, because of who scored that goal. crosby is a great player, but he was not great in this tourney.  toews and nash were outstanding in that game."
438384,danbouck,2010-02-28 23:40:00,4380, take that crap elsewhere. He was fantastic the entire time as well as all the Canadian and American players!
438385,bushart,2010-02-28 23:43:00,2628,CAN I GET A WHOOOO! HOOOO!
438386,camillj,2010-02-28 23:43:00,1988,Story book ending ... and was just a little tooooo close for my liking .... but WOW ... its been a LONG time since I remember being that excited about a hockey game (maybe since '72) ... or an Olympics (none come close) .... perhaps the best ever for me ... and my daughter is right there in Vancouver working at the Aquarium ... how cool is that !!!!.... talk about living vicariously through your kids
438387,uglyfish,2010-02-28 23:44:00,981,"what were u watching?? im sorry, he wasnt that good in this tourney. if u think he was, good on ya. we each are entitled to our own opinions."
438407,hammercarp,2010-03-01 00:09:00,964,WOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOO! and a YEEEEE HAAAA to boot!
438454,fish_fishburn,2010-03-01 01:32:00,1311,"Please uglyfish, Its time to celebrate. You sound like a grumpy old bugger. Way to go boys."
438468,Daplumma,2010-03-01 01:50:00,1961,"That was an epic batlle for sure,good game and thanx to the refs for letting the boyz play.Much closer than I thought it would be.Congrats HOSERS. Joe"
438471,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-01 01:53:00,709,im with you guys on this one.  about the crosby thingy.  winning goal but  the other deserve more aplause.  they worked good as a team. and deserved it!
438520,uglyfish,2010-03-01 03:38:00,981,"  im neither. i can assure u no one is more happy to see us win the gold over the americans. i live for international hockey. i prefer the junior tourney but anytime there is an international tourney im front and center with my canada jersey, worn proudly, cheering on our team. i am, and have been celebrating all afternoon.  all i was doing was pointing out some facts and voicing my opinion about what i seen. apparently there are some people who dont believe we should have an opinion about how we view  the games. (not referring to u)  im not here to start fights or argue online. as i said, i dont consider myself an expert, but i know the game of hockey.  after i said what i did... the rest of my posts were simply defending myself against what others were saying.  this will be my last post on the subject... as i am apparently wrong about my observations about the games, and the others were totally rite and clearly know far more then i must about the sport."
438524,hammercarp,2010-03-01 03:53:00,964,Uglyfish The point is no one really gives a rats behind for a concise analysis of the game. I don't anyway. I just want to enjoy it. Man that was a buzzkiller of a post.
438530,tb4me,2010-03-01 04:19:00,3295,"wowzers waht a game! IMHO Crosby did his job on team Canada,,He was there when it counted..lets not forget its a team sport!  Congrats go out to the entire Team Canada!!"
438620,douG,2010-03-01 16:18:00,2693,Don't harsh the buzz.
