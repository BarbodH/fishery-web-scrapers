438078,TJQ,2010-02-28 14:31:00,7806,Ya... umm today.. I think im gonna keep my mouth shut... its gonna be a tough one....
438080,Handlebarz,2010-02-28 14:36:00,3790,All I can say is take out Miller in the first shift and we will walk away with it. My daughters 10th family B-day party is today at 3pm she has already been warned there will be no party until Canada takes the gold.  This is the best ending to what has been a great Canadian Olympics what a game it will be.  Cheers
438086,danbouck,2010-02-28 14:53:00,4380,I think Miller is going to play the best game of his life today. I just hope Luongo will as well.
