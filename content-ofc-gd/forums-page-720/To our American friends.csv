I know silver is never enough for the players in this situation, but they truly made it very exciting for millions to watch.  That game could have gone either way and none of the players have anything to be ashamed of.  Someone commented earlier in a thread about the Olympics being only for the amateur atheletes.  Again, I know where he is coming from, but I can't think of anything as powerful in this neighborhood or town that has brought pe9ple together than watching the best hockey in the world on a Sunday afternoon.  I have lived in this neighborhhod for 11 years, and I met people today for the first time that have lived here for the same period of time.  We shared a nice day and a patriotic laugh as I was in the driveway playing hockey with my daughter wearing a Canada jersey.   Thank you to both teams for a wonderful final  Cheers  Craig"
438428,uglyfish,2010-03-01 00:42:00,981,"well said! and yes, hats off to the american team... they were a powerhouse all tourney long! miller was lights out. not too bad for a team that was ranked as the 6th best team in the tourney."
438435,Cudz,2010-03-01 01:02:00,2652,Canada wins 1st period and part of second period.  USA wins a good part of 2nd period and pretty much all of the third. Canada wins overtime. USA is a solid team indeed and they were not there by accident or fluke.  They were legit
438437,bigfish1965,2010-03-01 01:09:00,3382,"I was not at all surprised to see the US in the finals. But I think any athlete, no matter where from, deserves a medal just for making it here. After watching these guys and gals do things at 140KM/h that you couldn't get me to do at any speed, I was immensely amazed and humbled. The woman that won bronze after breaking 4 ribs and collapsing a lung...my hat is off to you...."
438442,TJQ,2010-03-01 01:13:00,7806,I agree...  its funny that it takes a game against the United States to bring out the best in Canadians....  Thanks for a wonderful afternoon!!
438475,Daplumma,2010-03-01 01:58:00,1961,The problem with winning silver is you have to lose to get it.At least you have to win a bronze.Great hockey game though and if we have to lose you guys aren't so bad to lose to.Bet you'll buy us a beer. Joe
438482,OhioFisherman,2010-03-01 02:04:00,6623,"It`s not if you win or lose, it`s how you play the game, sportsmanship, not enough of it these days."
438527,holdfast,2010-03-01 04:06:00,1813,"Did anyone notice that there were no Habs players playing,  if it wasn't for Komisarek getting hurt Toronto might of had a rep.  Was there any Ottawa players??? Yea Im slagging the Habs, I dont think they had a player play for Team Canada in a decade."
438548,Jer,2010-03-01 12:16:00,1426,"  Kessel was playing for the US, not to mention the coach and GM."
438581,dave524,2010-03-01 13:40:00,4508, Kaberle was playing for the Czech's too
438597,dobee,2010-03-01 14:28:00,301,"what i loved about the games, was the fact that even with the loss the canadian fans cheered for the american team.. mens and woman!  also, the NHL should adapt the salute before game, where the teams line up on the blue line and raise their sticks in respect to the other team. i really liked that..."
438646,Rich Clemens,2010-03-01 18:01:00,3131,"I saw that too - all the Canadian Fans showing their respect for the American team during the medal ceremony.  That showed true class and I was really glad to see that.  I'll bet the players themselves appreciated that as well.   This is what the Olympics should be all about - win or lose.  Just being there is a monumental accomplishment in itself and should not go unrecognized, no matter which country you are from.   Canada did a magnificant job and all Canadians should be proud."
