438759,pike slayer,2010-03-02 00:12:00,1177,ya im pretty sure he was just a screwed up lake trout! i did feel bad for him and took him care of him
438770,redneck666,2010-03-02 00:54:00,563,square tailed lake trout...... new species
438774,solopaddler,2010-03-02 01:12:00,8605, I guess so eh?
438781,Dara,2010-03-02 01:21:00,3052,  Maybe you're allowed 5 of em
438819,redneck666,2010-03-02 02:57:00,563, yumm..... lake trout. i wonder how many people have kept over ther limit without bein caught this year?
438438,pike slayer,2010-03-01 01:10:00,1177,"My buddy sent me the pics of this lake trout he caught when we went out 2weeks ago. this tail is screwed up! it doesnt look like its been bitten or tore off. theres the traditional white at the tip of the tail. he was caught in about 8feet of water. impressive that he could swim and survive. he was a stubby 18"" haha!!    "
438441,Spiel,2010-03-01 01:13:00,9065,"Best guess, recently released brood stock splake. Possibly accidental or intentional."
438446,pike slayer,2010-03-01 01:18:00,1177,the lake isnt stocked...
438448,highdrifter,2010-03-01 01:20:00,2534,Clearly... it's the stubby gene!!
438452,Twocoda,2010-03-01 01:23:00,4130, what are you using for the stubby reference?....neva mind....i dont really want to know ...
438463,waterwolf,2010-03-01 01:39:00,556,"the dorsal fin is of a laker ,  the anal fins and tail are color and shape of a brookie.  a lot of snow on the fish in the pic but that's what i see from here."
438465,trevy727,2010-03-01 01:40:00,351,is it not a brookie? look at the size of it's head.
438466,troutologist,2010-03-01 01:43:00,951,I would tend to agree with Spiel.  That worn look on trout tails often comes from keeping them in captivity.

438481,Raf,2010-03-01 02:03:00,3495,yah that's definately phil.
438498,irishfield,2010-03-01 02:44:00,26272,Is there a slot... looks like someone let one slip back in after trimming with the Rapala sissors...
438503,pike slayer,2010-03-01 02:53:00,1177,shhhhh!! had to keep him under slot!!
438507,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-01 03:04:00,0,  Nobody woud do that...........
438509,redneck666,2010-03-01 03:10:00,563,LOL!!!!
438512,xeon,2010-03-01 03:16:00,350,"I've been catching allot of those deformed lakers directly downstream of the St. Mary's Paper outflow within the past few months.  But my guess for this one is either its a birth defect, or something may have bit its tail off when it was younger and it was regrowing."
438523,danc,2010-03-01 03:51:00,4677,I agree that it seems like there is some Brook Trout genes in that fish. It has more orange on it than the other fish. Is there any Brook Trout in the area? Brook/Lake Trout cross happen occasionally in nature. It doesn't have to be a stocked fish for it to be a Brook/Laker cross.
438526,pike slayer,2010-03-01 04:01:00,1177,"there is specks in the lake but very rare. i only know of one speck being caught in the lake by my uncle 2weeks ago, first speck he seen in there and hes beening fishing it for 20+ years and well first one ive even heard of. if its a cross then its definitely a rare fish for this lake."
438528,xeon,2010-03-01 04:11:00,350,Its not a splake. Its not a speck. Its a laker with a deformed tail.
438547,solopaddler,2010-03-01 12:08:00,8605,It looks like a splake to me. They have been known to occur naturally.

Jazz Guy: You've enherited a form of stubbiness.  It's usually past down from the father's side.""  Homer, whilst trying desperately to clutch a beer:  ""Stupid fingers!!!""  "
438662,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-01 19:10:00,0,poor deformed namaycush.
438684,solopaddler,2010-03-01 20:45:00,8605,"The fact that there's a chunk out of the tail is interesting but moot. I've never seen a pure lake trout with a mostly square tail before, that's what's significant about the fish."
438685,pike slayer,2010-03-01 20:49:00,1177,"tail looks ""natural"" colour and all there does not look like it was bitten off or anything."
438726,Beats,2010-03-01 22:45:00,543,It's definitely an interesting fish.  I would also lean towards the splake direction.. but I'm no expert.  Made me find this old pic on my computer.  
438746,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-01 23:33:00,158,"its a laker with a deformed tail.  Solopladdler  hit the nail on the head though, the square tail is the most interesting thing.  Other people are also right in saying that captivity wears down tails, epecially if they are kept in concrete tanks/raceways.  Glass, fiberglass, plastic or net enclosures also wear fins but not that severe.  Teh worst cases are always in older fish, which this guy isn't.  I have seen some wierd deformities in caught in sampling nets before, stumpy rainbows, zigzag tail perch, potbelly walleye, mouth deformed muskie.  With the snow and ice on the fish my best guess its just a laker with a birth defect."
