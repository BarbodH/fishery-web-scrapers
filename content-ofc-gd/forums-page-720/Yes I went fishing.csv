438459,Mike the Pike,2010-03-01 01:37:00,3421,Well its been along time after having my Dad in the Hospital for 2 1/2 months it felt great to be fishing again on the ice.  I fished a tournament in Alexandria Ontario.Nice prizes checkout the website.I would have liked to have gone to the Montreal outdoors show to meet up with Mercer but sometimes fishing has its priorities. Sorry no pics I left the camera in GlennK's truck and when your are trying to win a tournament well the camera was forgotten.  Alex Fishing Derby  Prizes started at 51st place and up.51st place pike was 2.447lbs and mine was 2.440lbs no prize for me there is always next year.  It just felt great to be fishing again.  MTP
