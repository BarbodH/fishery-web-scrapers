861629,daysoff,2014-07-04 19:32:00,5,recently after over fourty years of playing crib I was dealt a 29 hand but could not count it because I counted last and the other team pegged out before me.do I still have bragging rights of saying I had a 29 hand? 
861631,Roy,2014-07-04 19:42:00,13728,You still have bragging rights but you lost.
861633,DOS,2014-07-04 19:46:00,119,"never happened, didn't count.   man that sucks.  Thats worse than a lone hand in red and your partner makes it black in euchre..."
861641,bushart,2014-07-04 20:23:00,2628,40 years at that game and I never had a 29
861644,Garnet,2014-07-04 20:36:00,2056,Well you were dealt a 29 now you just need to play a 29.
861645,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-04 20:36:00,10439,I've been lucky enough to play out two or three 29 hands over the years. And you may have had a 29 hand but you didn't get to play it so..................................................
861647,Fisherman,2014-07-04 20:37:00,7201,"That's like catching a record fish 1 minute after midnight on closing day, nah, don't count."
861655,bushart,2014-07-04 20:46:00,2628,Ya still have your health
861667,Big Cliff,2014-07-04 22:23:00,6899,Dream on.....
861671,cheaptackle,2014-07-04 22:53:00,849,"And now to REALLY confuse the issue: You're question contained the answer - you were DEALT a 29 but could not PLAY it as the opponent pegged out.  You HAD a 29 hand but it was not SCORED as the game was over. Sorta like the song says - kinda like winning the lottery & dying the next day... But at the very least you proved that you know HOW to count a 29 hand, if only I had a nickel for every self professed crib expert who tried to peg 19...  Michael"
