She's a LOTW girl that knows how to jig, thats it. Down here we have to work for our fish. Anyways, drifting around my spot on X lake, she nailed 2 3lb+ smallies to my one and assorted smaller bass, perch and some decent worlds greatest sportfish. For those who know me, bass is bait but fishing for anything beats not fishing at all. It was nice to get out with her and have some fun, especially the back and forth banter. She can bust them with the best of the boys."
