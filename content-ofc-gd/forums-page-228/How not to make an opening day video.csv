Hmmm, gotta be careful how you say that... Anyway, I decided to make a video at one of them. It didn't go well.  Step one, set up tripod and camera  Step two, short intro on lure selection  Step three, proceed to make six casts and catch three bass, each one about a pound, pound and a half  Step four, beam proudly and tell the viewers how the Xzone Swammer on a weighted hook is an absolute bass magnet  Step five, notice that the video camera hadn't been turned on.  RESTART!  Step one redux, start casting again, completely forgetting the intro  Step two, catch small pike that destroys the last Swammer  Step three, switch to a Slammer and get nothing, not surprising since they're better for drop-shotting  RESTART AGAIN!  Step one (again), Switch to a spinner bait  Step two, utterly fail to notice that the rod has been assembled with the guides totally out of alignment  Step three, proceed to catch smaller bass because you've given the larger ones sore mouths  Step four, post embarrassing video anyway, because FISHING!  Enjoy. Or not, I wouldn't want to be arbitrary. Watch at 1080p for maximum embarrassment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDs30GLRfI"

861117,Pikeslayer,2014-07-01 14:14:00,1443,Enjoyed it Dave. Is that a Pflueger reel?
861121,Dave Bailey,2014-07-01 14:35:00,1641,"Enjoyed it Dave. Is that a Pflueger reel?  It is, a President. Was on a matching rod until I broke it, Tightlines in Pickering (I miss that place) replaced it no charge with a Shakespeare when Pflueger took ages sending a replacement. Apparently they come off the same production line and are virtually identical. Doesn't really matter to me, as far as I'm concerned the most important thing in fishing is to get something in front of their nose, they don't care what it's attached to."
