Slower start each morning, but once the fish turned on it was pretty much non-stop all day.   Perfect weather, great company lots and lots of big fat smallies!   These fish were crushing spinnerbaits, once hooked it was time to get airborn!   Extremely hard fighting fish, they just didn't want to give up.

861138,kickingfrog,2014-07-01 15:23:00,8333,Good on ya. I've been hibernating for 4 days. My perfect weather is 10 degrees cooler and way less humid.
861140,BillM,2014-07-01 15:25:00,17367,Good on ya. I've been hibernating for 4 days. My perfect weather is 10 degrees cooler and way less humid.  We fished from maybe 7am-12pm then that was it.  No way I was staying out there in that hot and humid weather.
861141,Steve,2014-07-01 15:29:00,2075,bone crushing smallies.  if I was to only pick one presentation (after top water) to hit smallies it would be a burned spinnerbait....  i like the nichols pulsator double willow leaf 3/4 ounce .... they burn and never turn.  great stuff!!
861169,kickingfrog,2014-07-01 17:34:00,8333,"Always want them on top but rarely is a spinnerbait the second option for me. It has nothing to do with effectiveness, just preference and habit. Growing up fishing bass in open, rocky lakes if the topwaters weren't working crankbaits or jigs would. Just have to have one tied on to start the day off and go to it when the bass won't come up."
861174,misfish,2014-07-01 17:48:00,29133,"Thats some sweet fish there fellas. Now that the Simcoe smallies have down their late spawn,it will be time to attack them."
