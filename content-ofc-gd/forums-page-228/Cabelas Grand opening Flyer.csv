861194,davey buoy,2014-07-01 19:12:00,5505,"So far BPS looks better,give it some time,they'll figure the sale thing out."
861199,hirk,2014-07-01 20:32:00,571,"You can get zipper pants or bibs with the qualifier but not the 100mph (handy when its leak time no need to strip down).I like the pants better than bibs,have a pair of suspenders so thsy stay up and i never get sore shoulders they way you do with bibs plus the 100mph is way to warm in the summer."
861202,Whopper,2014-07-01 20:47:00,2174,Ah the honeymoon is over and they aren't even open yet   BPS Pro Qualifier suits usually get discounted after the first of the year on their first big sale
861012,farsider,2014-06-30 22:56:00,456,"This was sent today.  http://digitaledition.qwinc.com/publication/?i=214494  Start making your lists...  Cheers, mark"
861020,BillM,2014-06-30 23:17:00,17367,"Ugh, I was hoping the Guidewear was a wee bit cheaper."
861024,kickingfrog,2014-06-30 23:29:00,8333,No early invite and now no email flyer.  I'm a little hurt.
861026,kickingfrog,2014-06-30 23:54:00,8333,"Ugh, I was hoping the Guidewear was a wee bit cheaper. Likely don't need big sales to get people in the doors at first."
861029,BillM,2014-07-01 00:06:00,17367,"Likely don't need big sales to get people in the doors at first.  Yeah, I'll wait until it gets down to $199 before pulling the trigger, that or the BPS brand, whatever works it's all the same."
861033,Steve,2014-07-01 00:12:00,2075,"if you go with the bps brand, take a long hard comparison look between the 100mph suit and the pro qualifier suit.  there are big differences in quality, and yet, the 100mph suit is more money."
861034,Gerritt,2014-07-01 00:20:00,6129,"After looking at the ad, I am a bit perplexed....  I see was prices....  And now prices....  There never has been a was in Barrie for Cabelas... Only a now....  So what are they basing this deceptive pricing method upon?  Other markets? The US?  Seems senseless to me, and deceptive for the consumer in my eyes.  I get it is new... But is little more then a rebrand to what already exists here.  I am not compelled.  G"
861038,can u fish,2014-07-01 00:42:00,326,Will be there July 8th vip pass 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm might end up being an expensive night.  Cheers Mitch....
861041,BillM,2014-07-01 00:56:00,17367,"if you go with the bps brand, take a long hard comparison look between the 100mph suit and the pro qualifier suit.  there are big differences in quality, and yet, the 100mph suit is more money.  Steve, you like the Pro Qualifier better then the 100mph suit?  I haven't looked at both closely yet, but it's time for some decent rain gear."
861042,Bernie66,2014-07-01 00:57:00,123,"That is their Grand Opening sales flyer???   How disappointing.  And all that anticipation.  With Le Baron's occasional no tax events and Sail's 15% off sales that occurs thru out the year, I think I'll be spending my money closer to home."
861044,Steve,2014-07-01 00:59:00,2075,"yes, I sure do.  put one in each hand, and go over each detail by detail. number of stiches. types of flaps. look beyond the decals and at the quality.  the pro qualifer is actually quite a bit better than the 100mph gear.  the 100mph gear is lighter however."
861046,Burtess,2014-07-01 01:00:00,901,Nothing in there that gets me going......  Burt 
861048,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-01 01:08:00,4399,I will be there July 7th but I don't see anything in the flyer that has me jumping out of my socks!!!
861052,solopaddler,2014-07-01 01:47:00,8605," Steve, you like the Pro Qualifier better then the 100mph suit?  I haven't looked at both closely yet, but it's time for some decent rain gear.  I like the Pro Qualifier suit way better too. Also bear in mind I can get you a deal on the suit I was wearing on the White River fly in."
861057,big guy,2014-07-01 02:32:00,414,I think I will go to Sail instead
861065,BillM,2014-07-01 03:08:00,17367, I like the Pro Qualifier suit way better too. Also bear in mind I can get you a deal on the suit I was wearing on the White River fly in.  I forgot to try on that suit... I completely forgot about that.
861084,Lucky Linda,2014-07-01 12:19:00,93,Great! I just bought the Guide Suit at Cabella's. What is the Pro Qualifier. Tags are still on...talk to me lol
861105,BillM,2014-07-01 13:47:00,17367,Great! I just bought the Guide Suit at Cabella's. What is the Pro Qualifier. Tags are still on...talk to me lol  Pro Qualifier is from BPS.  The Guidewear stuff from Cabelas is good stuff.  I wouldn't go returning it to be honest.
861115,kickingfrog,2014-07-01 14:09:00,8333,I bought the Cabelas rain suit a few years ago when they had a great deal. Zero complaints about the quality.  Just watch out if you are ordering online because at Cabelas midnight black is blue/black. So if you're ever out on the water and see a guy with a red rain jacket and blue/black rain bib on it's likely this guy.
861118,Steve,2014-07-01 14:20:00,2075,"no need to return Linda.  the guidewear will be good, i'm very sure.  just pointing out that at bps, the ""cheaper"" outfit (only by like $30 bucks, but is cheaper) seems to be of better quality.  not often is the cheaper version a better version. not as flashy, not as popular. but better quality.  have a great trip Linda!"
861119,bigugli,2014-07-01 14:21:00,6138,I won't be stopping in. Nothing to entice me either.
861133,Beans,2014-07-01 15:09:00,3339,I'll stick to Mark's Bait and Tackle here in town...long drive to BPS or Cabella's...the saving on gas will make it worth while...
861134,tizfun,2014-07-01 15:14:00,292,Not impressed by the flyer at all... Had planned on taking time off from work to head up on the opening day.  Not !! Will wait for the weekend or there after just to see the store..
861189,misfish,2014-07-01 18:31:00,29133,"Oh my,,,,,,,,REALLY,,,,,Thats it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Hope they have my favorite yum tube. Thats about the only good deal I see. Oh well. It will be a place to hang on non fishing days."
861191,Steve,2014-07-01 18:36:00,2075,i wonder who will be the first to fail there.  bps? sail? cabelas?  there isn't any hope in heck that all three will survive in that location.
