860647,porkpie,2014-06-27 22:20:00,2521,"Some laws protect us from those who cannot self regulate.  For example, I can go out for dinner and have one beer, and then realize if I have any more I may start to become intoxicated and be a danger on the roads because I am not a drinker and have a low tolerance for alcohol.  I then self regulate, and drink soda for the rest of the evening, or if I feel the occasional need to get smashed I may ask my wife to drive home and she is a smart girl and will limit herself to one drink.  Enter the person who cannot self regulate, and they drink 7 or 8, realize they have no plan to get home, and say screw it I'm fine I'm a good driver.  That person then kills a family on the way home from their grandparents house.  Same situation on a boat, same people can't help themselves but to push the limit."

It only took me about 5 minutes to start my buddies boat, when he forgot the keys to his bow rider. Unplug the ignition switch connector from under the dash. Jumper-ed the battery feed to the ignition system with a 6"" steel leader (Know your tackle box LOL) and then a pair of needle nose pliers to momentarily jumper the terminals of the ignition switch connector to crank the engine. I'm not as fast as the movies; but Gone In 300 Seconds. LOL  Dan."
861381,aplumma,2014-07-03 01:11:00,6896,Yup I had to jump a few boat switches in my time. The big boat the security is not in the keys but where they are hidden. The switches to start the motors are toggle switches on the panel but the search for the keyed switches will take some time. I also wired the battery switches backwards so off is on for an added measure. locks are for honest people for the most part anyone with the basic skills can pick the locks but more importantly anyone who wants to bypass a lock doesn't care if they damage it in the process. Not that any of this is right all that a lock does is prove intent of trespassing or burglary in a court of law.    Art

Cheers Peter  Don't get me wrong, what happen to this boat is a crime and those who did this should have to pay.  As for compliance, there is a grey area for some but if your mandate is to generate revenue then there is no grey area, they label it ""Zero Tolerance"".  So for the people that I know who have been fined for having a floating flashlight with dead batteries or a life jacket with a slight tear in a seam or being 15' from their dock in a paddleboat in 3' of water and not having a safety kit I would say that it's for the sheer objective of raising revenue and in no way the public safety.  And you're right they are out there to do their job only, it's not like they're telling us who we should or should not vote for."
860445,landry,2014-06-26 14:01:00,1005,"Go to Honey Harbour or Detroit R on a Saturday. That explains why OPP patrols are absolutely needed and purposeful. Boaters drive full throttle thru narrow cuts and many have absolutely no understanding of regulations, courtesy and safety. They can barely dock their boat without incident in many cases. I grew up in Honey Harbour and have seen some seriously messed up behaviour and accidents. If you don't speed and have your safety stuff then it's all good. Landry"

860502,aplumma,2014-06-26 19:20:00,6896,I have no issues with complying with the rules of the road/water and if I decide to break them then I am big enough to pay the fine. For someone to destroy a vehicle be it a boat or a car should be an outrage to the community that paid for it in the first place. I live with the rule if it is not yours don't touch it without permission even if it is left idling at the wharf. Few things boil my blood as people doing stunts like this.   Art

It doesn't mean that you would not be spot checked by DNR. They usually will see the sticker and then ask to see 1 or 2 items from the list like a life vest and your extinguisher. They will then ask you to hold up your fishing license or we also have a whole boat license we can purchase for extra money that covers everyone on board. I have a personal license as well as the whole boat license to cover my friends that do not fish but once or twice a year. After a check or two DNR knows the boats they have checked and they will usually give you a wave and ask how the fishing is.   Art
