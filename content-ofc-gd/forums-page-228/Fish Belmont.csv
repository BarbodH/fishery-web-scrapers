861087,Paudash,2014-07-01 12:51:00,273,I am planing to fish for the first time on Belmont lake near Havelock this weekend.  Can anyone help me with a map of the lake.  I will be looking for Bass

861263,Ainsley,2014-07-02 03:44:00,142,"I fish there once a year for the last few so I know a few spots.  PM me if you're interested. I caught plenty of decent sized largies on 4"" keitech swimbaits last year, no pike though."
861335,Joeytier,2014-07-02 20:00:00,3990,Fished it a couple times...both times we hit a good schools of big smallmouth and I caught a nice walleye there once too.  Focus of the mid lake area around the big island and the river mouth for a good starting point
