Yup, the only thing I find is that the reflective finish is easily chipped off the head itself.   I'm going to start putting a few coats of clear nail polish on them to see if that helps."
861006,Rustic-Fisher,2014-06-30 22:29:00,826,Agreed  keep it simple . Remember those pigs we hooked 8' from shore while we fished from the shore at that back lake we hit.  Doesn't get much simpler LOL
861013,aplumma,2014-06-30 23:01:00,6896,Senko wacky rigged with no weight or if it is a faster presentation it is a cotton cordell  big O white med dive.    Art
861027,d_paluch,2014-06-30 23:58:00,343,Saturday on Simcoe most fish were caught within 4-6feet. Caught a few in a foot or 2 deeper but most action was shallow as we were mainly sight fishing.  Fishing the deeper water has always been something I've struggled with. I love when threads like this pop up on here because the wealth of experience and knowledge makes for a good read.  The presentation of choice for this weekend was baby bass coloured wacky rigged senkos and baby bass coloured caffeine shads.  Next weekend the spinner baits and crankbaits are coming out in full force lol
861028,BillM,2014-07-01 00:05:00,17367,"I started fishing crank baits quit a bit last year for both smallies and largies off deeper weed/rock edges.   I'm trying to get out of the rut of always throwing the same patterns (ie topwater because it's so addictive, lol)"
861031,manitoubass2,2014-07-01 00:09:00,11391,"Spinnerbaits are deadly, i use black with silver Colorado and willow leaf blades. Strike king pit belly spinners are deady(i too fish current). Another tactic I've learned is like crappie fishing when there suspended. Small or large plastic, dropped to where you mark them, then lift and drop. Not really a jig but slower, they bite on the fall   Jerk baits work too and i also love rapala dt 10's in golden shiner or crawfish patterns"
861035,OhioFisherman,2014-07-01 00:35:00,6623,"Tubes aren't just a deep water lure, lighten the weight and they work fine in water 5 to 12 feet deep.  Small hair jig, 1/8 - 1/4 ounce and pork or plastic for a trailer.    Small crankbaits, my favorite was the Storm Wee Steelie wart, but there are others that work.  Roadrunner style baits  http://www.basstacklemaster.com/Sworming-Hornet-Fish-Head-Spin-p/shfhs.htm  A better hook than the standard roadrunner, you can also by a ponyhead mold and make your own.  A Heddon sonar or other style blade bait, they vibrate like crazy and trigger strikes, you have to adjust your retrieve speed to the water depth, not just a jigging lure.  Ball head or Mushroom head style jigs, throw on a 4 inch worm, lizard, or 3 inch grub.  Carolina rigged soft plastics.  Float n Fly, they work for smallies too.   "

861074,misfish,2014-07-01 08:42:00,29133,Agreed keep it simple . Remember those pigs we hooked 8' from shore while we fished from the shore at that back lake we hit. Doesn't get much simpler LOL  That was crazy. Now if I could only remember how to get back there.
861075,mike rousseau,2014-07-01 10:57:00,4661,Thanks for all the replies everyone...  Looks like I have a few things to try...
861106,BillM,2014-07-01 13:48:00,17367," That was crazy. Now if I could only remember how to get back there.  Back lakes, you could toss marshmellows at those fish and they'd bite.     :)"
861392,Ainsley,2014-07-03 01:43:00,142,"Was crushing them on Saturday and Sunday on a luckycraft pointer 100 in ghost minnow and aurora black. Was trying my fav baits and nothing: keitech swimbaits, terminator t1 spinnerbaits, bomber crankbaits, and tube jigs."
861425,singingdog,2014-07-03 10:49:00,1047,"Your original question covers lots of behaviour/presentation territory, and should bring up lots of questions that will lead you to understand smallies better. Before I threw something at them, I would ask myself a few questions: 1. Where in that depth range are the fish? 2. What ""mood"" are they in? 3. What kind of water (clarity, productivity) are you fishing?  Aggressive smallies, no matter what depth they are holding, will rise a long way to hit. BIG spinnerbaits, burned super fast, is a great way to find them and catch them if they are aggressive. In that case, you don't really need to worry about the depth of the fish.  Finicky smallies, holding tight to the bottom, or stubbornly holding at 8' in 12 FOW are a whole different story, especially in current. If they are on the bottom, that is easier then if they are suspended. Maintaining bottom contact gives you constant feedback. Trying to present at 8' in 12' of water is much, much tougher.  I am surprised that no one has mentioned lipless cranks. They are one of the most versatile, and most effective smallie lures in my box. You can burn them for aggressive fish, count them down to pretty much any depth, or fish them right off the bottom like a jig. I catch lots of big smallies in 25 FOW with lipless cranks."
861439,Garnet,2014-07-03 13:02:00,2056,"This is a good point Aggressive vs Finicky.  They aren't  necessarily finicky when you go to dropshot our tude.  Yesterday they just weren't looking up burned spinner baits, snapping jerks , buzzing cranks nothing. Pull out the dropshot and they had it most times before it hit the bottom. Put they didn't seem to want exacter movement on drop shot just hold in 1 place.  That article we all read about finicky hard to catch smallies is mostly crap. ""Smallies are killers and the bigger they are the more aggressive they are""."
861445,Shloim,2014-07-03 13:35:00,515,"I use a lot  of 4"" gulp minnows on darter jig heads and jerk baits are usually good too... I try to keep it simple"
861455,mike rousseau,2014-07-03 15:20:00,4661, Same here yesterday  Shallow bite was crap... Tried 20-30 feet deep with tube and drop shot... Drop shot produced so my partner switched over but brown instead of the smoke I had on... He was gettin bites 2-3 to my 1... I switched to brown and it was game on...  Tons of light bites and dropped fish tho...  They can be fussy little buggers...
860947,mike rousseau,2014-06-30 18:38:00,4661,Hello all  So I've been bitten by the bass bug... So now I have a new species to learn about... More specifically smallmouth bass...  I've got onto a few shallow (under 5 feet deep) patterns...  And I've done well deeper (12-30 feet deep)...  But I don't have much game in the mid depth water... 5-12 feet deep...  I was gunna turn to swimbaits on a hefty jig or some cranks maybe... But I was wondering what you guys like to use in these med depth situations...  FYI... I fish clear water and in current most of the time...  Thanks  Mike
860950,mattp33,2014-06-30 18:55:00,290,"I am not a smallie expert but I aswell got that bug.  I would opt for a jerk bait most likely, and try to get them to come up for it.  I just got a few from 12 fow burning a spinner bait (not the best option I dont think tho)  You could also try a drop shot, seen a lot of guys throwing them on simcoe this weekend"
860951,Joeytier,2014-06-30 18:55:00,3990,Rapala DT Thugs or x-raps/livetarget smelts are great active presentations
860953,Sinker,2014-06-30 18:59:00,8692,Smallies=Topwaters....but I don't fish bass hardly at all. When I do its topwater smallies or nothin!  S.
860961,misfish,2014-06-30 19:25:00,29133," OH MY.  One of my favorite ways to nail smallies and largies is with a spinner bait, along with dragging tubes and drop shot. Jerk baits work well.   I nailed some largies this morning burning (or as I call it.bubbling spinner baits) Just below the surface. Two of them hit five ft from the tube. What a blast."
860962,BillM,2014-06-30 19:27:00,17367,"5-12ft, spinnerbaits, jerkbaits or topwaters."
860964,mike rousseau,2014-06-30 19:33:00,4661,I've been using spinnerbaits... Jerk baits... Wacky rigs... In shallow water... But my results in mid depth with the same baits aren't great
860966,BillM,2014-06-30 19:39:00,17367,"You sure the fish are actually there?   I am not a fan of super slow fishing (tubes, dropshot, etc) unless I've located big schools of fish (usually this is in the fall)..  Burning spinnerbaits is a killer smallie technique as is topwater over the edges of deep drops."
860967,pidge,2014-06-30 19:41:00,438,"Caught some in mid depth this pay weekend on a 6"" plastic worm rigged weedless. Didn't take long after the bait hit the water before the fight was on. Caught a beaut last summer on a different lake using same technique.  Pidge."
860968,misfish,2014-06-30 19:42:00,29133," What blades are you using? Colors? Body color?Trailer? Here it,s an easy match for me.  Willow blades,brass and nickle. White or yellow body.Weight is another factor."
860969,mike rousseau,2014-06-30 19:42:00,4661,I haven't fished  much in mid depth honestly... Maybe it was an off day... We have had some show interest by following.... But few actually hit... Or hit well enough to get hooks in I should say

860971,mike rousseau,2014-06-30 19:44:00,4661,3/8-1/2 oz  Usually a small silver Colorado on the bull with a gold willow on the end...  Usually a white/green combo bait
860972,BillM,2014-06-30 19:45:00,17367,"I had a killer opening weekend this year.   Probably some of the best smallie action I've ever had.  Mostly all came on white/chartreuse spinnerbaits, colours of the blades really didn't make a difference.  Gold/silver/white, etc.    Most fish were off the edges or in the deep stuff between the rock shelves.   Stupid numbers."
860975,misfish,2014-06-30 19:53:00,29133,"3/8-1/2 oz  Usually a small silver Colorado on the bull with a gold willow on the end...  Usually a white/green combo bait  If your going to burn,1/2 is best. I did throw 3/8,s but it was a bit of a work out to get it to get up just below the surface. Fishing from the tube,I have noticed that it,s a whole lot different then in a boat.  Keep at it,you,ll get them."
860977,davey buoy,2014-06-30 19:56:00,5505,"We did well again with Big O's(White),Smokin Joe's(White/grey) and sexy shad(blue/yellow /white).All in the larger size.They run from 4' to 12' in that order.Good luck Mike in what you choose,sure lots of options."

Dont get me wrong, I am a power fisher and always have a white KVD scortcher tied up I just dont know if thats the best option for smallies in 10-15 fow.  I know they will come up mighty fast from depths to chase stuff so maybe it is the BEST option"
860982,mattp33,2014-06-30 20:30:00,290,I also like these for that kinda depth  
860990,misfish,2014-06-30 20:56:00,29133," There was no offence being made your way.  I can tell you about a day I spent on the lake and only took two rods. Both with spinnerbaits. One of my best days. Fished from 8 -15 fow. Zigzaged.in and out.Sometimes we make it so complicated. The past two days I had a top water,worm and spinner bait on three rods. That was it. No box to retry different baits. All worked for me.  As for spinner baits,I was a Stanley man,but have since gone with BOOYA. Thats why I always say,BOOYA,when they hit."
860993,mike rousseau,2014-06-30 21:08:00,4661,I agree misfish.... MOST days it's not complicated... Spinnerbaits shallow and drop shot deep for this guy... But some days it's not that easy to boat fish... Yesterday it was the 4th or 5th pattern we tried that proved to be best... And it was like night and day... Instant results and consistently caught the rest of the day...  But the bigger fish seamed to be hanging in 5-12 feet... And those are the ones I was hoping to catch
860995,misfish,2014-06-30 21:14:00,29133,  HMMMMM Think I replied to your question Mike.  Heres another tip.  MICRO TUBES. Dont laugh. Slow dropping bait. Try it and let me know how you do.

861001,Garnet,2014-06-30 21:42:00,2056,One of the first things to find out. Are they feeding up or are they feeding on the bottom.  Take a 1/2 and add a 3/8 rubber core. Take about half the skirt out. You will know the amount when suddenly have speed control with excess pull.
