860369,corvette1,2014-06-26 00:17:00,1765,"  Kevin and I flew in to Eddie North's Camp at Windsor Lake.  On Saturday we unpacked and got the camp ready.  We only fished for four hours and got three pike in the low 40's.  Didn't get another big pike until Friday....we got two more in low 40's.  Monday night it rained for 27 hours.  Sunday through Thursday we caught hundreds of average size pike and walleye.   Overall we had a great trip.  Thanks Mike and Eddie.   Pike 42""  Small Pike were sure hungry  100's of Pikes caught like this  another big Pike  Kevin with a nice Walleye  That;s what 27""s of rain looks like!"
