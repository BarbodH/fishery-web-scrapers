861368,bass_man,2014-07-02 23:43:00,43,As some of you know I am fairly new to the Brantford area and I was hoping that someone could point me to someone around here that does reel service and repairs.  I have a couple of late 60s Mitchel 300s and 2 late 60s zebco cardenals that need looking at and a few bait casters as well.  Does anyone know anyone localy that they trust for this kind of thing.
