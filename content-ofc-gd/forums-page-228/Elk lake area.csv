860885,occcanuck,2014-06-30 12:08:00,2,Has anyone fished this area recently?  We are heading up to long point lodge on Saturday for a week of fishing and was wondering how the fishing has been up there.  It hasn't been easy to find much info online in this area.  Thanks
860923,Oggie,2014-06-30 17:02:00,588,I hunted that area for grouse a few years back just for something different.  I know they fish the Montreal river for walleye and I think they do well.  I found information hard to get and I was right in town.

I'm rather disappointed as I would have liked a couple 2lbers.  I know this is not Elk Lake but is close by.  Grassy lake near Shining Tree was pretty much the same.  Nothing over 12""."
