All can be fixed once you rip off all the emissions stuff though for the most part.  I did a lot of research before I bought.  What you mention is not actually an issue with the Engine, but with the Emission Systems.  Most of those were brought in/mandated starting in 2007 - > http://www.dieselpowermag.com/tech/1107dp_dpf_the_time_bomb_under_your_diesel/.  Article made a good point however - it is very similiar to Gas Engines, when Catalytic Converters were added.  Huge problems, until Engineering/Technology got it right.  Most DPF systems now run quite well - or at least better than they did.  Time will tell - but the truth is you put the same emission systems on a Cummins - you will have the same problems.  I am hoping I don't have any issues - but when the warranty runs out, I am pretty sure there will be a shop that can ""delete"" the items causing the issues, and allow me to run the truck without problems."

So I'm ripping out the entire system and installing an 'offroad' race pipe.  No more DPF, a tune and a solid 30+whp and 50MPG when we're done.

I find it work prevalent after coming off the highway.  I think it has to do with the active grill shutters but not sure.  Thanks in advance  cheers  What is the smell like?  There was something when I first picked it up, but it was probably just stuff ""burning"" off the pipes, etc.  That is pretty normal for new vehicles, and will last for a bit.  I am at about 700KM now, and notice any smells diminishing.  Remember getting a brand new Rental car - had 1KM on the Odometer.  After about 5 minutes it smelt like it was on fire - but just a new vehicle."

Generally after I've been on the highway and then exit and slow down, it does dissipate after about 2mins. Its hard to describe the smell. I know what burning oil smells like and its definitely not that. It does seem like a burning off smell, but like I mentioned earlier, it still seems to be there. However It does seem to be dissipating somewhat. I'll give it another 500km and see if it disappears.  If it does completely disappear for you please let me know.  Thanks"

It has the 121L tank right? whats that costing to fill up.We are considering trading in our 4 Dr wrangler sahara, but not sure what to get. my current travel situation it costs me $100 during the week and extra on the weekend to drive the jeep."
860303,hutch4113,2014-06-25 16:45:00,374,"Right now I am getting 18 mpg with 90% city driving.  That is only one fill up, and with 800 KM on the odometer.  Some guys are reporting high 20's (27 - to 29 MPG) with more highway driving. Last fill up cost me $100 (about 77 liters).  I believe you are correct on the tank size.  My Fuelly ->  There are a few other Rams on fuelly now (with Diesel).  So you can search there to do some comparisons.  They have more fuel ups than I do, etc.  Diesel right now is about 10 cents cheaper than Gas - but in the winter will be about 10 cents more, so that is a wash probably.  Should also advise that 18.6 includes towing my boat twice - it was short distances, but I did not see an impact - either to speed/power, or fuel economy. "
860305,dracokaos,2014-06-25 17:27:00,116,"I believe the 121l tank was an option on the outdoorsman trim package. I've been down pretty low on the fuel gauge and only can squeeze in about 77l so I believe the tank on the Big Horn is 80L. Having said that I'm getting close to 1000km per tank combined city/hwy. On the highway I sit about 6.5l/100km or about 35mpg. Right now my mileage is at 9.5L/100km, 25mpg but that has been mostly city and pulling the boat.  I live in Whitby and for the past 3 weeks have been working straight days in downtown Toronto. its costing me approx. 12$/day in gas return trip.  IMO the Dodge is the way to go, especially if your looking at saving some gas but still want the power to yank around the toys.  Cheers"
860314,BillM,2014-06-25 17:46:00,17367,Are you hand calc'ing that mileage over an entire tank?   35MPG US on the highway seems extremely optimistic.
860316,hutch4113,2014-06-25 17:48:00,374,"You are correct - I had the tank number wrong.  It is 26 Gallons, or roughly 98 Liters.  A bigger tank could be ordered, but as mentioned is restricted to certain trims (also some complain about in on the Gas Vehicles - it apparently clunks when not full - and you come to a stop).

The EGR issue can be common with CCV systems.  I understand these diesels produce more blowby than gassers which doesn't help matters when it comes to caking EGRs, intercoolers etc unless you vent these to the atmosphere."
859314,BillM,2014-06-18 21:44:00,17367,"Raf they are having issues with the O2 sensors on the one mounted by the turbo chargers. They keep sending conflicting info causing sooting that cakes on the turbo and clogging down the line. Another contractor is running 3 of these engines and has replaced 4 O2 sensors and 1 turbo before 100 thousand miles. The EGR recycling valve also sticks and will soot up and put the vans into limp mode. The solutions so far is to run BnG diesel additive in the fuel. Before running this additive the back of his trucks would be sooted in 2 days and now it is just slightly discolored in 2 weeks.   Art  You really need to drive these engines, lugging them around will lead to all sorts of problems (especially the ones you mentioned)...  RAF, I vent my TDI to the atmosphere to rule out CCV vapours making their way back into the intake via the TIP, I also deleted the EGR..    Most guys that have issues with gunked up VNT/VGT mechanisms drive their cars like 90 year old ladies.  Put the boots to it a few times a day and I doubt you'll have any issues."

Even Porsche used a VGT (First one in a gasser since the old Turbo Dodges from the 80's)....

I don't get any sort of smell in my cabin either (Gotta remember there isn't much coming out of that tube at all... Most of it is stuck to the inside of the tube anyhow).   As for freezing, unless you're using an extremely small tube, that's not something you should worry about.

I have almost 2k on it now. Gas milage continues to get better.  I got the BigHorn package. What did you get??  I ordered end of March (24th) but it did not actually go in until April 7th, when the allotements opened.  Build was May 5th/6th, but then it sat in QA for about 3 weeks (that was long..lol).  I was looking at a loaded Big Horn - but wife saw/sat in a Laramie and liked it better.  Ended up with a full load Laramie, including Air Suspension."

I ended up getting the Laramie for about 15K off MSRP  - I think I had the Big Horn at about 44K when all was said and done.  The Laramie ended up being about 6K more so was ok."
859458,aplumma,2014-06-19 20:41:00,6896,"My first wetting in the world of turbos was to take a 280z and mod a 280zx turbo and controls on to it. The turbo controlled by the mass airflow sensor reboxed and then run thru a volvo intercooler has a separate pressure switch that closed off the return to the tank and raised the fuel rail up to 65lbs. Talk about lighting the candle when you floored it. lol. It would eat corvettes on the straights as well as keeping the balance correct in the corners. Best car I ever built out as far as performance. The current ride is the eco boost that is stock and with the sequential twin turbos and the 3.72 gear set it has all of the grunt I need to tow as well as getting surprisingly good gas mileage but not as good as they advertised. I have gone to 2 wheels now for my speed fix with a SR500 track bike that is street legal and my latest build is a RZ350 with a custom programmable CDI,exhaust,porting, carb.,punched out twice over. So far we have gone from 42 HP to 67 at the rear wheel. The clutch had to be reworked from a R1 as well as beefing up the suspension to keep it controllable. I love two strokes. lol.  Sorry for the distraction from the original post.  Art"

859568,BillM,2014-06-20 11:52:00,17367,Diesel vehicles also get better mileage when it's hot and muggy outside.  Winter diesel has less BTU's per litre because of the anti gelling treatment it receives at the refinery..  So don't worry once it's -30 out and you're getting not so stellar mileage
859592,Raf,2014-06-20 13:20:00,3495,Do you guys plugs yours in once the temps reach -15 to -30??
859594,BillM,2014-06-20 13:28:00,17367,"Do you guys plugs yours in once the temps reach -15 to -30??  You shouldn't have to but anything that helps with wear and tear during cold starts is a good thing in my books.   If you can without too much of a hassle, absolutely yes.  Also, don't let it idle, start it up, let it even it self out then drive it.  You won't gain any sort of engine temp in the winter by letting it idle for 10-15mins."

I find it work prevalent after coming off the highway.  I think it has to do with the active grill shutters but not sure.  Thanks in advance  cheers"
859019,hutch4113,2014-06-17 20:21:00,374,"Was towing my boat with a smaller CUV, but never really liked how it handled it.  Decided to get rid of my Car and jump into the Truck world.  Since i have love Diesel - and Ram came out with one in the 1500, I was sold.    Now I just have to do some towing.....and of course fishing....."

859064,Rod Caster,2014-06-17 21:45:00,5784,If this model was released last year there is a good chance I would have bought it over the Cherokee Trailhawk

859083,hutch4113,2014-06-17 22:16:00,374,"Response to Leaf4 - for some reason the quote option did not work for me.  Have not done any towing on it as of yet, other than a short trip to pick up my boat out of storage - only drove it about 5 minutes.  But in terms of driving it - love it.  Won't be as fast as the Hemi, but still pushes you back in your seat enough to make you grin.  Super quiet - actually I would like to hear a bit more Diesel noise.  I am averaging at the moment 11.6 l/KM (I think that is around 20 MPG) in mostly City driving.  Guys who do more highway are reporting 28 to 30 MPG (not towing).  Backup camera is right in the tailgate - centered over the hitch, so makes that part nice backing into the trailer."
859089,Joeytier,2014-06-17 22:23:00,3990,"They are very nice trucks, and you are getting some real excellent mileage so far, especially considering that it doesn't even sound like it's fully broken in yet"
859102,BillM,2014-06-17 22:45:00,17367,"Awesome! I was wondering when someone here would pick one of these up.   If this truck gets the mileage it should, you'll be extremely happy!"
859129,Bernie,2014-06-18 00:21:00,3190,"I see the diesel in this truck isn't a Cummins. Makes sense in a 150, they would be too heavy. The engine was developed in Italy and is now co-owned by General Motors, Fiat and Chrysler.Hope they are as reliable as the Cummins."

The engine was developed in Italy and is now co-owned by General Motors, Fiat and Chrysler. Hope they are as reliable as the Cummins.  VM Motori makes the engine, as they did with the one in the Liberty.  The GC in '07-'08 was Mercedes sourced if anyone is wondering."
859199,aplumma,2014-06-18 11:16:00,6896,The Mercedes connection was dissolved when they sold Dymilar-Chrysler over the diesel engine design. The Mercedes motor found in the Sprinter vans has issues and was then evolved exclusively to the blu tech engine for the only Sprinter now produced for/by Mercedes. Sadly the added technology did not make the engine as good as the inline 5 they used up till 2005. Fiat entered in as Mercedes left and then the final evolution of the Dodge motor was created. Either way you got a very nice truck and it should give you years of carefree service.   Art

Actually Fiat bought out GM - GM no longer has an ownership in VM Motori, who make the engine.  This particular motor is 5th or 6th generation (been used in Europe for quite a while now).  So far it looks to be good."

I only have 600KM's on it now.  Figure I won't start seeing the real mileage until 2K or so.  But even with it not broken in, it is right about where I calculated.  I did the numbers comparing it to the Hemi, as I needed to verify when my break even would be (diesel is 2850 more than the Hemi - or something like that).  I figured I would probably fill up every 1.5 weeks, and I am pretty much on target for that right now."
859212,BillM,2014-06-18 12:25:00,17367,"You won't be seeing the best mileage until it's broken in, more like 10-15k    This is a diesel after all...  The break in period is a lot longer then your typical gasser engine.  Right now I'd worry more about proper break-in then mileage.   No cruise or constant rpm driving if you can help it and drive it like you stole it."

859261,jedimaster,2014-06-18 18:37:00,3472,You are getting about the same mileage as my 2013 v6 ram 1500 gets. Does yours have the 8speed?

859283,aplumma,2014-06-18 19:53:00,6896,Raf they are having issues with the O2 sensors on the one mounted by the turbo chargers. They keep sending conflicting info causing sooting that cakes on the turbo and clogging down the line. Another contractor is running 3 of these engines and has replaced 4 O2 sensors and 1 turbo before 100 thousand miles. The EGR recycling valve also sticks and will soot up and put the vans into limp mode. The solutions so far is to run BnG diesel additive in the fuel. Before running this additive the back of his trucks would be sooted in 2 days and now it is just slightly discolored in 2 weeks.   Art
