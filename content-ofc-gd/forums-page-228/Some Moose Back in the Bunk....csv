860816,spincast,2014-06-29 20:31:00,3279,"Condolences on Bren and your loss. Love the golden sunsets up there - I think I took the same shot from the same place when we visited back in 2010.  That train trip is just a great experience - but man, the skitters up there must take steroids - they is some kinda big. Good luck  and enjoy the change in life directions - as I'm sure you will"
860828,Moosebunk,2014-06-29 22:02:00,3970,"Thanks Rick.  The skitters were in full force on the island during the trip, as blood thirsty as ever.  Years on that train I could do with out it, but having the Eco Lodge nearly to ourselves on the last night and family there with us through the other nights made for a great stay.  Although it's not a happy reason for a trip north, the chance for Bren to have all her family together from far and wide was nice.  It doesn't happen enough."
860837,Joey,2014-06-29 23:15:00,9122,Superb pics as usual Drew.  Sorry to hear about Bren's uncle.  It's been a weird year for sure!!!!
860841,Gregoire,2014-06-30 00:31:00,1397,As usual a grant post with incredible visuals. Sorry about the loss.
860855,smitty55,2014-06-30 02:35:00,928,"Losses bring families together, so some good is still done. Sorry for your loss.  Great pictorial Drew. Still tells a story. I especially like the last one.  Cheers"
860882,Terry,2014-06-30 12:03:00,14456,Damn
860897,Moosebunk,2014-06-30 13:51:00,3970,"Losses bring families together, so some good is still done. Sorry for your loss.   And that's just it Smitts!  Those times truly do.  And in recent years although people shed tears and mourn the loss of loved ones, as is the way, a number of more recent funerals attended have been considered ""celebrations of life.""  These sadder times can now include a more calm and even happier reflection of one's time with us, allowing some good memories and times to come from the experience.  Maybe should not have put this into a ""fishing report"" here as not at all looking for sympathies but, the time was a part of our family's spring and it was more to pay some short homage to a great man, as well as include the Moose to this seasons report.  Each time I travel North, especially James Bay, I am reminded how incredible the scenery and big skies are up there... and also how amazing Bren's family is.   Damn   A man of many words Ter."

861067,Dave Bailey,2014-07-01 03:19:00,1641,"Condolences. It never gets easier, but it isn't supposed to. Your pictures are beautiful, and I hope we see many more in future. Haven't spent a lot of time at Moose Factory, but they were memorable times. It's a lovely area."
861076,limeyangler,2014-07-01 11:12:00,5204,sorry for your loss Drew. Great post as per usual. i would never get bored of panfish like those......i would still be out there fishing....lol.
861258,Moosebunk,2014-07-02 03:06:00,3970,"Thanks Mike, Doug, Dave and Simon.  Yes Mike... at a crossroads of sorts with work... but been there before and things have always turned out fine.  Always some stress making the necessary changes though.  Simon... don't get me wrong pannies are fun... for awhile.  Yet if given the choice during spring, I'd take fishing other things like lakers, gar, walleye or bows if I know they're biting."
861319,fishnsled,2014-07-02 17:33:00,3520,"Deepest condolences to Bren and your family, sounds like he was quite the man.  Some great pics as always and an enjoyable read, thanks Bunk.  Good luck with the decision process."

861389,Moosebunk,2014-07-03 01:38:00,3970,"Thanks gents.   I love this kind of stuff Drew. History       Middleville Ontario Brian.  Pretty well middle of the road along a country route called the Wolf Grove between Hopetown and Almonte, but turning off to head north on the Galbraith Rd.  This farmer's fence line is made up of derelict farming equipment.  In the field behind graze Highland Cattle.  First time turning down that road it was a scenic drive from there over to Clayton."
