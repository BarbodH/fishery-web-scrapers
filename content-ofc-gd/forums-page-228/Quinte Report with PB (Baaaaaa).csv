The bass were tight in cover. Nothing to brag about (the bass that is), however I did get a PB freshwater drum, what a mutant.               One last fish after a beautiful day on Quinte          Cheers...."

861417,Joeytier,2014-07-03 08:09:00,3990,What a monster.  My pb sheepy came from very close to there as well.  I bet it fought a little harder than those little green thingys
861457,Joey,2014-07-03 15:46:00,9122,That's a big sheepy.  That sign on the bridge is kinda cool.  Thanks for the report!
