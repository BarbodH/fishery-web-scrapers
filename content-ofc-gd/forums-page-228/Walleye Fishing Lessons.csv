861513,ninjia3x,2014-07-04 00:21:00,1,"HI all,  I was wondering if there are any fishing charter that takes more of a teaching focus rather than just purely landing fishes. Look for someone willing to teach in the Kawartha Lake or under 3 hours from Toronto.  Thanks for any recommendations, "
861516,Joeytier,2014-07-04 00:24:00,3990,Taro Murata and Greg Klatt are both right up your alley
861517,BillM,2014-07-04 00:26:00,17367,"Yup, hire a guide you'll learn a lot."
861520,captpierre,2014-07-04 00:44:00,2521,some good stuff on YouTube
861556,mark demmery,2014-07-04 12:07:00,68,"I've been out with Taro.  Well worth the money if you want to learn.  I booked him for Musky, but decided to fish walleye first.  I'm not even a big fan of walleye, but we hit 25 or so in an hour. Cant complain about that!"
861587,mike rousseau,2014-07-04 15:16:00,4661,Just tell the guide your goal for the day  Most will teach you HOW to fish... So you can apply the techniques to other spots...  Or they can take you to COMMUNITY spots to show you a few spots to get you started...
