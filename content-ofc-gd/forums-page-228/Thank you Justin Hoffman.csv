I just got the new issue On Canada Day what a great way to celebrate Canada's Birthday buy a present for myself LOL. Their are a lot of great bait makers in the article. Anglers Choice and Bondy bait Company are also in  the SW corner of Ontario Water Wolf/Bass Magnet lures are closer to the east side of Ontario I am glad to call them all friends and share this with them  Cheers Mike
