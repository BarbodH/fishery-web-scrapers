Every half hour or so, I have to run the bilge for 20-30 seconds, then repeat the process. Last night, I beached it. We've ruled out the obvious problems......livewell intake, and transducer mount. I had it up here month ago with no issues.  Any ideas??"
861212,cheaptackle,2014-07-01 21:38:00,849,"If it isn't a leaking bilge plug the only think I can suggest is put in on the trailer, use a garden hose to slowly fill the bilge and see if there's any visible sign of water leaking back out from a rivet, seam or previously undiscovered damage.  Leaks work both ways usually, it's a down and dirty way to find them.  Just watch your springs & tires, water is heavy too!  Michael"
861213,kickingfrog,2014-07-01 21:43:00,8333,How well does the plug fit?
861226,bigcreekdad,2014-07-02 00:28:00,546,"Plug seemed to fit good, and even tried another.....not the plug.  Rats!!!"
861236,BillM,2014-07-02 01:30:00,17367,"Yup, drop it on the trailer and get out the hose.  You'll find the leak soon enough."
