860744,Garnet,2014-06-29 12:06:00,2056,"Launched at 7am. First spot noticed some casing likely May Flys really no way to tell in 20 ft of water. Pretty slow in the beginning.  Then noticed a big hatch of blue dragon fly's. There are a couple variety's and again it really doesn't matter because the seem to be in 15 ft of water.  Things picked up we landed 9 walleye, 4 smallies ,2 largies, 2 muskies and 1 pike.  No consistency in presentation this day just kept grinding it out.  Around mid day seen some may fly's the tan coloured ones you can look them up on Wiki.  Think the boat traffic was main reason for low numbers.  "

860895,esoxansteel,2014-06-30 13:38:00,1307,"Scrougin Walleyes was definately the norm, i was out early to avoid most of the heat, fish in the dark for almost 2 hours, throwing #8 Shad Raps which accounted for 5 fish before dawn, and then slowed to bucktails pitcin the weed clumps for another 2 hours which resulted in 3 more eyes, had one strike and 2 follows fishing flies for muskies as well, but the follows were lazy, and interest was low. Much slower then last week or the previous weeks, also fish contour lines with Bouncers and Gulp leeches before it breaks into the basin figuring the eyes have moved closer to summer haunts, but that did not produce at all. Water temps was 73 degrees at 3:30am, and 74.9 when i left at 11:00am, up 4 degrees from last weekend"
