860922,BillM,2014-06-30 17:02:00,17367,Seems a bit gimicky.
860933,blaque,2014-06-30 17:38:00,2419,"I remember someone on here, in a post about a week ago that said they get this. Cant remember who or what thread it was in.  Hows that for not being able to help at all"
860934,blaque,2014-06-30 17:41:00,2419,"found it, page 18 of the linked thread has a mention of it  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=43490&page=18"
860935,d_paluch,2014-06-30 17:41:00,343,"I get them, got it as a gift for a year from my girlfriend. To be honest I love it. The soft plastics they give are a trial pack, usually of 3-4 baiots, and they always include 2 4/0 or similar size worm hook.  If you are curious as to the baits they send out, check their facebook page and look through the pictures. You always get a 'main' bait/lure, which generally has a store value of 10.99 or more.  Personally, I love getting a gift every month that is fishing related!"

860937,bare foot wader,2014-06-30 17:45:00,1354,"I'd say you get your money's worth but it's not an amazing deal, usually get a main lure and then some small stuff...I received it as a gift, but for 180$ annually, I'd rather spend that on my own"
860940,d_paluch,2014-06-30 17:58:00,343,"I say try it out and use the promo code they have for the first box @ $4.99. If you dont like it, cancel your subscription.  Then at the very least you get a bunch of tackle for real cheap."
860943,hutch4113,2014-06-30 18:23:00,374,I signed up for the 3 month - figured why not.  I mean you can never have too much fishing tackle....right Skud?
861266,tbaltovski,2014-07-02 04:19:00,38,I got the $5 for one month for them and lucky tackle box.  I'll post what I get.
861272,solopaddler,2014-07-02 11:19:00,8605,Next time send me your money instead Adam. I'll dip into my excess and put a couple of mystery bags together for you.
861276,Brettiop,2014-07-02 12:23:00,279,"Got the 3 month trial, forgot to cancel for the next 3 months,  They are pretty neat, got some nice live target lures and can never have enough spinner baits.  But yes, you will end up with a bunch of soft plactics. I decided to cancel because i rarely use soft plastics anyways.  Bass anglers may like this a bit more...."

861408,AdamS,2014-07-03 03:17:00,161,"My buddy signed up for that a while ago.  I think last month he got a crank bait and 2 trial bags of soft plastics (I could be wrong) but I say trial bags because you only get 3-4 per bag. I agree with Brettiop. It's a cool concept, and if your looking to try something new then its not a bad deal."
861555,Skud,2014-07-04 11:39:00,739,"You are right Adam, one can never have enough tackle. You can only have one ""go to"" lure though. The problem is figuring out which one it is."
861559,BillM,2014-07-04 12:24:00,17367,"You are right Adam, one can never have enough tackle. You can only have one ""go to"" lure though. The problem is figuring out which one it is.  Bondy bait."
861648,Lunatic,2014-07-04 20:37:00,536,"i signed up for the 6 month one,so far its been hit and miss for me.but i guess it all depends on what lures you already have or have too much of.so far my boxes have been one hard bait 2 or 3 packs of sample plastics and 2 hooks and weedless jigs.ive had other things but thats what i usually get."
861656,grizzlybri,2014-07-04 20:48:00,565,I got the 3 month one as a Christmas present last year. Got a live target lure the one month in it
