860900,Moosebunk,2014-06-30 14:07:00,3970,"Hero2 or 3?  If 2, what setting?  Oddly, I could be in the clearest water filming with the GoProH2 and find that it is often poor quality.  Good to see ya enjoying your season Mike."
860906,Handlebarz,2014-06-30 14:49:00,3790,Hero 3 for the hero 2 you need a flat lens for underwater shots
