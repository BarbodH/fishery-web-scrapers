Managed to nail a few and sometimes I need to remember to set the hook. The heat from the sun was enough for us  by 11 am.         A feathered fishing bird joining us along the banks.      Day two  On the water by 5am. Apparently they were calling for high winds,but for some reason,it was a beauty of a morning to be out on the tube. The weather man is a dick.LOL My plan was to try  fly fishing for some bass and pike. These flys sure are heavy once they get the water in them. I brought the wrong rod for the job. But still gave it a go with no luck.      So I packed the fly rod away, and started to top water and throw a worm for the morning.  It worked well.  Mixed bag. Pics from the morning.            There was a threat of a storm moving in so was off the water by 11.  DAY THREE  Another stellar morning to be out.                DAY FOUR  With the bad weather they been calling for all weekend for Canada Day,,  ,we werent sure if we would get out. There was a window of opportunity . No storm til noon. So on the water at first light again. I had a feeling the fish would be on as this storm was coming and fish always seem to be very active before a good storm.  I was right. First cast and BOOYA BABY. Boiling spinner baits was the ticket all morning,with the odd one on a worm.  Boiling a spinner bait, is one of my favorite ways to fish buckets. It was awesome to watch them hit only 5-6 ft from the tube.                  Lost count how many snot rockets we got.They will hIt anything.    With the one sound we didnt want to hear,it happened. THUNDER. Head back to shore just in the neck of time. The skies opened up.    The look during the drive home.        And the end is near.     So no real big fish,but a whole bunch of fun.  Speaking of big.  I have no pics as I was more worried about getting away from them. This lake has HUGE snapping turtles."

861254,Tim Mills,2014-07-02 02:45:00,476,"enjoyed the fishing report and the storm chasing pics, Thx fir posting, nice streamer fly as well."
861259,Moosebunk,2014-07-02 03:11:00,3970,"Chucked a white spinnerbait a good number of times from the tube too.  Can't go wrong with it, the lure covers water and catches bass.  Solid four days of fun Brian... and Terry.   Won't hear complaining about the cold come winter either so will say now, the heat is a bit much eh?!?! lol."
861277,woodenboater,2014-07-02 12:30:00,2277,"Nice days there Brian. I hear you about flinging large flies for pike. Maybe try some wooly buggers next time, I found bass and pike like them and they're much easier to cast. I found short quick strips usually gets their attention"
861279,misfish,2014-07-02 12:43:00,29133,Thanks guys. Im going to fabricate something so I can take water level vids. I missed a great chance at a pike smashing a top water and leaping in the air 3-4 ft doing a twist.  Bass hitting 4-5 ft right in front of me on the surface.
861302,fishnsled,2014-07-02 15:30:00,3520,Looks like a great 4 days to me!!  Thanks for the report and looking forward to seeing the fabricated rig.  The footage should be quite incredible.
861304,misfish,2014-07-02 15:42:00,29133,"WB,thanks. I have a few cases full of them. I,ll have to give that a try next time.  Thanks Wil. I cant wait til it,s set up as well.   Not sure about that Drew. I have been told my hub is like a sauna at times."
