860793,bow slayer,2014-06-29 18:10:00,1074,"trying to start this 5 hp 2 stroke johnson for my dad and thing will not start. I believe it is a 99. The plug is good,the gas is fresh,clip on kill switch is good,and there is no secondary gas shut off valve like on my 5 hp nissan. Only thing i can think it is the small black spark control thingy. The thing ran perfect last season.  any suggestions,thing is so simple cant think of anything else it could be."
860796,Sinker,2014-06-29 18:28:00,8692,Is there spark?  Could be the coils (small black spark control thingy)  S.
860799,bow slayer,2014-06-29 18:56:00,1074,"yea thats what I am thinking,there is no  spark"
860800,Garnet,2014-06-29 19:02:00,2056,check to make sure the coils are plugged It. Usually 4 wires on a plug going to coil.  Your spark plug wire goes to the coil.
860840,bow slayer,2014-06-30 00:05:00,1074,"yea all wires were hooked up, coil unit must  be pooched"
860887,Ralph Field,2014-06-30 12:38:00,1018,"If he forgot to run it dry, then the gas left in the carburetor may have gummed up the nozzle."
860888,sauce,2014-06-30 12:57:00,219,May be stator. Get someone to look at it before buying any parts.
860910,Freshtrax,2014-06-30 15:11:00,2215,"Bypass the kill/tether switch see if you have spark, start with the simplest things first."
860917,Roe Bag,2014-06-30 15:54:00,246,Remove the spark plugs. Wipe dry and remove any oily residue. Replace plugs. Re attach plug wires. Squirt a small amount of fuel mixture directly down the throat of the carburetor.  Do not choke. If after a few pulls you can't get it to fire then you know it's an ignition problem. If it fires and runs briefly then you have an issue with the carburetor.
861064,ecmilley,2014-07-01 03:07:00,2163,Do you have spark? Nice blue or blue/purple spark. If not you have a charge coil ignition module or coil to diagnose.  Can be the kill circuit I believe if you have no spatk disconnect the black wire with yellow stripe from ignition module if you have spark problen in kill circuit. If not gotta check for voltage outta charge coil . Coil resistance module output ect
