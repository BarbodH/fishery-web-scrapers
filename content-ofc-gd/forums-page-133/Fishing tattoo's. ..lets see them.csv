Although at one time back in the 80s I was that close to getting the Rolling Stones logo on my left chest but chickened out in the waiting room at the shop. It was only going to be 40 bucks."

Close call! For $40 you may have been walking around today with the ""Roolin Scones""?? on ya!  BTW, do you pay by the hour of seat time or a quoted completed price?"
962774,bow slayer,2016-03-16 16:57:00,1074,"that was back in about 1988,40 bucks was the average price for one that was about 3 inches in diameter and at the time was best shop in London.same thing now would be over 200."

963216,pike slayer,2016-03-20 14:56:00,1177,Haha nope. I never seen the show. I did a quick Google search I couldn't really find any good pictures of his tatt but he's a definite copier lol

963318,pike slayer,2016-03-21 00:44:00,1177,I couldn't get a close up picture of bam bams tattoo but it looks very close to the same thing. About 4-5 years ago I was watching a bear grylis show that was kind of like survivor(can't remember the name) and one of the contestants has this tattoo. https://www.google.ca/search?q=tree+sleeve&client=tablet-android-samsung&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjYvsKCxdDLAhUBWxQKHbSHDcAQ_AUIBygB&biw=800&bih=1280#imgrc=EWr522QzhLAJMM%3A  That's where I got the idea for mine. I've had the tattoo for about 2 years now.
