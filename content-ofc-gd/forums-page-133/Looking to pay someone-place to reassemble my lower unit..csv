962831,Smokercrafty,2016-03-17 00:57:00,227,"Hey guys, before the softwater season gets rolling, I'm looking for someone or someplace to reassemble the lower unit of my 30HP Johnson. I have all the parts, seals, gears ready to go. The housing and all parts are cleaned and ready to reinstall. If there's anyone on here competent enough, or can refer me to a place that rebuilds these puppies, I really wanna get my spare motor back together this season.  Thanks for any input...."
962855,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-17 02:59:00,8243,"The marinas are probably all booked right now for at least through May. Too far for you to come this way I'm sure. I know the East Lake, or is it west, Hospital is just under 3 hours from us one way. You would have to leave it for a few days as we are swamped here too getting our boats ready. In January, Feb. no problem, spring is the worse time to get marine work done, sorry."
962901,Smokercrafty,2016-03-17 17:14:00,227,Thanks for the insight Ironmaker...... Hopefully someone within range replies now... Lol Guess I should have posted this month's ago....

Thank god the current motor hanging on the back of the boat is OK. Damnit..... I may just have to learn this reassembly gig via you tube......"
962970,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 04:26:00,8243,It's not Rocket Science Smokey. A socket wrench and the right parts and 3M 5200 sealant and you are good to go. If I can do it anyone can. You Tube is actually a good resource. While you have the bottom end apart change the impellor. A great resource also is iboats.com. Ask the question there and you will get answers on a DIY for your specific engine. I am Old Ironmaker there too.
962973,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 07:14:00,8243,"If you can wait a few months we can do it. My sis-in-law lives in New Market and I'm sure she is coming down to the lake for a visit soon. You would need to pick it up and go for some monster Walleye or Smallies here with me while your at it, by the time we limit out the boys should have it all done. I don't know how that's going to play out since it's only our hobby here. I don't know how that's going to play out!"
963057,Smokercrafty,2016-03-18 18:26:00,227,I appreciate the offer Ironmaker.... Looks like you're a few hours away from me. I'll definitely keep it in mind.
963062,jimmer,2016-03-18 19:26:00,2730,Do it yourself. That's the best way to learn and someone said it isn't rocket science. It's very rewarding when you finally get it all together.

963066,mikeh,2016-03-18 20:31:00,824,"I've used Top Gun Marine in the past and very happy with there service, not sure if they work on that kind of motor?I think they are just a little north of Newmarket"
963068,davey buoy,2016-03-18 21:34:00,5505,"11 south of 89. Honest guy,think he works on everything. Helped me out with a great price and great work.Again the price seemed always fair.Used him 2 times now ."
963101,Smokercrafty,2016-03-19 02:27:00,227,"Those are both reputable marinas that I've heard of. I've dealt with Kim, down at Central Outboard. I felt he was honest and I didn't get hosed. I'll shoot them both a call for pricing. Or I just may set all this stuff up in my basement, and go at it. The only thing I'm concerned with is that I've heard gear backlash needs to be checked. And is it specs I need to know, or just make sure their mating properly...... Sigh...."
963175,tizfun,2016-03-20 00:41:00,292,There's a guy who posted an add on Kijiji and is in the Oshawa area who works on Johnson's and Evinrude's.. look up his add. I called him regarding some info on my 30hp Johnson and he texted me back all the info I needed... Unfortunately I sold it and bought a 30 Yamaha...  He seems like a nice guy...  Paul at Top Gun Marine in Bradford is awesome if he as the time... I've sent a few friends his way and they were pleased with his work and prices..
963176,Smokercrafty,2016-03-20 01:12:00,227,"Thanks tizfun..... Off to Kijjiji I go, t have a look."
963186,Triton Guy,2016-03-20 02:31:00,8,Try this guy he was really reasonable for the work he did to my  motor. He is in Sutton on Baseline Road next to the york regional police station.   Alec  http://www.dcmarineservices.com/
