963041,Broker,2016-03-18 16:21:00,482,"Hi guys,  Going on a camping trip into Algonquin in late April early May. We are going from Rock-Penn-Welcome and staying three nights on Welcome Lake. The main objective of the trip is obviously fishing, so I was just wondering what your opinions are about bringing both a spinning and fly fishing outfit. I don't have sinking fly line either. The reason why I ask is because I obviously want to pack light, so if the fly rod is unnecessary I will leave it at home.  Thanks!"
963043,BillM,2016-03-18 16:37:00,17367,"Get some long sink tips, that should be able to get your down deep enough in the spring (Which doesn't have to be very deep).   Troll that along and hold on."
963044,Jds63,2016-03-18 17:05:00,1365,"Ahhh ....Algonquin , how I miss thee....  Welcome is a nice lake ... with a nice beach campsite. I never used a flyrod in there but I imagine you could depending on weather and hatch times. UL spinning gear with small spinners tipped with worms is fun too."
963048,highdrifter,2016-03-18 17:35:00,2534,Yep you'll definitely want a sink tip or a full sink line..  Muddlers and leech patterns are a staple in my box.  I like to troll a full sink line and switch to a sink tip when I want to cast to some likely shoreline.  Good luck!
963126,Tim Mills,2016-03-19 15:24:00,476,Bring both fly and spin.  Post question on algonquin adventures website too. Might get some specific lake and site advice.
963133,Oggie,2016-03-19 16:48:00,588,"I surveyed that lake for the MNR and the rest in the chain (Harry, Welcome and Rence).  Not sure if they're still special regulations but they were at one time.  Welcome certainly is a beautiful lake and I do remember that beach even though I haven;t been in there since 1971. I'd thnnk the brookies will be on top at that time of year but they're hard to pattern in a lake so trolling the fly makes sense."
963158,Joeytier,2016-03-19 22:15:00,3990,"I troll flies quite frequently in the spring and fall here (many fly-fishing only lakes).  I use full sinking line and troll likely shorelines with leech flies and conehead muddlers, black is always best for me.  Very effective technique, but if you don't have sinking line, at least get some sink tips."
963184,captpierre,2016-03-20 02:01:00,2521,"Only fished Algonquin once at trout opener. Lots of guys out. We fished shallow. Tried everything Nothing. End of day at the launch, nobody caught except 2 guys. They jigged salted minnows in 60 ft with sonar in canoe. Couldn't believe it."
963263,Garfisher,2016-03-20 19:37:00,229,"Welcome-Harry-Rence still have the special regs of artificial lures only (no worms/inverts or other bait allowed) and a minimum size of 36cm (14""). Welcome is definitely the lake to target for brookies based on personal experience, fish shallow in the mornings and evenings and deeper water during the day. You can definitely get fish on topwaters in the evenings especially if the water is still cool."
963336,jjcanoe,2016-03-21 03:08:00,744,"There is a small creek behind the beach site on Welcome and depending on water levels, you may get a small trout or two back there. Been a long while since I've been there but Welcome or Louisa will be your best bets for trout"
963340,Chuck Enwinde,2016-03-21 05:08:00,247,"The flyrod is almost definitely unnecessary but,  if you love using it - then bring it.  The portage to Welcome isn't bad at all really.  I'd plan to double it and bring some luxury items including the flyrod."
963385,jayess,2016-03-21 19:16:00,187,"+1 on Louisa. There's a great island site with a ""natural"" rock table... real nice. Try trolling around the northeast side of the island (I know this is poor reference as there's more than one island... just troll anywhere and you're bound to hit a laker!)."
