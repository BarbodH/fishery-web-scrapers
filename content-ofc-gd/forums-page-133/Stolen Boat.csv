963586,Skipper D,2016-03-23 02:27:00,1970,"The owner of this boat says the boat was picked up by Skyway Transport and not Skyline Transport and doesn't want to make the mistake of blaming a legit company . Skyline Transport is working with him to try and locate Skyway Transport as they have also been getting many calls about Skyway . This info just came to me tonight , Thanks to every one for reading ."

I can see setting up a fake transport company in a city and making off with a few high end vehicles then closing shop. All you need today is a cell phone and a website and you can make it look like a big outfit. I have seen some very elaborate lengths some people will go to con good, even very smart people to relieve them of their money to make a few big scores. I lost a good chunk of change years ago. I wonder how the boat owner came to hire Skyway Transport?"
963739,Reel Man,2016-03-24 09:27:00,80,Not sure if this is any help but it's what I turned up. Hate thieves and scammers too!!!   You work hard and scrimp and save for a little bit of the good life and some creep wants to steal it away from you so they don't have to work for it.
