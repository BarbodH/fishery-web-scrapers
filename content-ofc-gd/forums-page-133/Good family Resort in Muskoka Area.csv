856346,Pikeslayer,2014-06-02 19:17:00,1443,"Sorry guys, just to clarify my offer was to Bowslayer. Unless you rent a cottage @ Silver Lakes or own a cottage there (then you would know the lake  ), you can't launch a boat. Both launches are private and secured. No day fishing opportunities on Silver Lake."
856370,BowSlayer101,2014-06-02 20:51:00,296,"Ok, thanks for the generous offer pikeslayer! Will check them out, pet friendly also wouldn't hurt as I'm not sure if we will be bringing the dog along."
856421,skdds,2014-06-03 01:35:00,195,"We've gone to Severn lodge (full resort-pool, programing etc) as well as rented a cottage from logpointe. Not inexpensive, however. Both on Gloucester pool-near T.O and short access to all kinds of fishing structure for multispecies. I've posted a report or two from there. Good Luck! Skdds"
856465,Shloim,2014-06-03 16:46:00,515,The Shamrock Lodge on Lake Rosseau. Tons for the kids to do and meals are included. Not cheap but lovely. I was just there last weekend with the boys and they exceeded every expectation we had!
856494,BowSlayer101,2014-06-03 20:12:00,296,"thanks for the input guys, was considering shamrock but its pricy and the max number of people is 6, we need space for 7. More suggestions are welcome, were considering wolsey lodge and tall pines cottages, anyone been to either one?"

It's right on Gloucester pool, great pike fishing near there,(I've caught multiple 5 lb+ in a weekend) tons of lilies and assorted structures for multi species!! good luck -junky"
