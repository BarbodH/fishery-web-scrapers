963675,netminder,2016-03-23 17:46:00,514,Doing my best to leave politics out of this... all I can say is that his heart always seemed to be in the right place. Whether or not his actions helped matters is another issue.  He will definitely be missed. Regardless of what you think of him he was too young to go.
963680,Dusky,2016-03-23 18:18:00,310,R.I.P Mr. Rob Ford. Sad to see him go so young. Surely he will be missed in political circus.
963681,Big Cliff,2016-03-23 19:24:00,6899,"Any time a man stands up for ""the people"" I will stand and salute that man! I truly feel that like many good people before him he was taken far too soon!"
963717,manitoubass2,2016-03-23 23:49:00,11391,"???  Never knew him, never lived in toronto either.  But he has a wife and kids, and hes a human.  RIP"

I will always wonder what he could have contributed after he dealt with his health problems.  His passion for his constituents was unquestionable.
963757,wkrp,2016-03-24 14:07:00,656,Rex Murphy on  CBC ' s National did a great commentary on Rob last night. RIP  and sincere condolences to all that knew and loved him.
963762,Acountdeleted,2016-03-24 14:30:00,2562,I was not a fan of Rob Ford the politician but he leaves a wife and children behind and I would never wish cancer on my worst enemy.  May he rest in peace.
963491,NAW,2016-03-22 15:17:00,4022,Looks like he lost the fight.  Not sure what to say. Sure was an entertaining guy.  Not going to be forgotten in our generation I don't think.

I'm not going to bash a dead guy in his RIP thread, but that comment is hilarious and couldn't be more inaccurate.  his politics may or may not have been good for Toronto ( I have no idea I don't live there), but good or bad, absent of nonsense he was not."

Well said, Rob was for the working class, and the people in lower class as well, visiting personally tenants in Toronto Housing, and getting those mold issues and leaking taps, to no hot water , to roaches to Bedbugs fixed, when the ones responsible turned their heads. Rob was one of the guys who you felt you could call him up and talk to him one on one and he listened, instead of brushing you off. Plus he was one tough fighter, both in politics, and in his battle with cancer  RIP   Great Mayor"

963563,pics,2016-03-22 23:33:00,1268,He certainly made politics interesting .. he was a great representative for his constituents.. too bad his personal demons got the best of him..
