963598,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-23 06:27:00,8243," I subscribe to MNR watch. Several poachers have been charged and convicted for various offences in the Nippising district in the last while which is good to hear.  This guy that was charged and convicted actually beached his boat in North Bay and a foot pursuit took place with his booty in hand and a C.O. in quick pursuit. If you haven't signed up to get news via email from MNR Watch an independent source and you are an avid, or not, fisherman or hunter there is good information there. It was recommended to join this site by Mr. T.J. Quesnal sometime ago.  Here is the link.  http://mnrwatch.com/2400-fine-for-taking-lake-nipissing-walleye-of-prohibited-size/"
963607,Rod Caster,2016-03-23 11:57:00,5784,"2,400 in total. 6 undersized. Risky business trying to keep a few stinking fish because you feel entitled."
963612,Rizzo,2016-03-23 12:57:00,4754,Morons. Running away with evidence in hand? Even guys with drugs and guns are smart enough to chuck them once the chase starts....and those things are reasonable easy to find again. A stringer of walleye released back into lake would be pretty tough to locate. I guess he didn't want to lose his $2.99 stringer
963614,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-23 13:01:00,8243,They must have been really hungry.
963619,lookinforwalleye,2016-03-23 13:30:00,4399,Y`all are forgetting humans are essentially a race of idiots....Ontario Fishing Community members excluded of course...(most)...
963622,curlrap,2016-03-23 13:51:00,58,The law system is a little funny. You could get away with a much less drinking and driving or even trafficking drugs but don't get caught with six fish!! I think he also lost his fishing licence for two years. You only lose your drivers licence for 90 days for drinking and driving.

If he shot a bear with a cub it would be 10 times that plus a year in jail...not that I condone poaching but seriously....

963633,curlrap,2016-03-23 15:07:00,58,His name get's plastered in the newspaper and social media...pedophiles are more protected from social media than a guy who gets caught with six dink walleye.
963635,Rizzo,2016-03-23 15:08:00,4754,"stealin property, stealin fish...what's next"

963638,Rod Caster,2016-03-23 15:21:00,5784,Ha! Troublemakers. In that case I'm glad they got fined heavily for the fish. Dummies.
963640,curlrap,2016-03-23 15:23:00,58, Ya it kinda sucks that we can't trash the pedophiles on OFC doesn't it? Just trying to make a point on how screwed up are law system is.
963642,manitoubass2,2016-03-23 15:29:00,11391,"I get your point but thats not what happens with most DUIs.  Ask fishinautographs(police officer on OFC)  I think its 2 years auto and about $7500 in fines, classes and a breathelizer installed in your vehicle that you pay for.  Approx cost of a dui is 15 grand and there is still the possibility of jail time"
963644,Rizzo,2016-03-23 15:33:00,4754,"...they might want to check into whose boat they ""borrowed"" and so easily abandoned on the shore as they ran away."
963645,manitoubass2,2016-03-23 15:35:00,11391,Hahaha no doubt!
