963433,Freshtrax,2016-03-22 02:10:00,2215,Well went looking for Browns and we found 10's of thousands of these guys and a bunch of oos fish.  Was a fun day to be out never fished here before. We actually had to chase this guy down as we were fishing 4 lb leaders.
963438,captpierre,2016-03-22 02:22:00,2521,Looks like a healthy carp to me. Did you only fish the western outflow?
963441,Freshtrax,2016-03-22 02:28:00,2215,Yea winds were sketchy out of the SE wasn't comfortable in the 16 ft tinner going round the pt. was more referring to the location with the mutant part.
963443,OhioFisherman,2016-03-22 02:48:00,6623,"LOL, it looks brown to me! They are a powerful fish."
963451,ehg,2016-03-22 05:03:00,2666,"A carp on 4 lb.leader with the big lake to run, nice. You did the work needed to get out there, The early mornings are still and fish filled. Took me a couple of times to figure that you had to go east side...insane fishing there.  Nice going at least you know how to do it, next east."
963506,captpierre,2016-03-22 16:32:00,2521,You are wise. Lake O will take you out and laugh at you as you drown  ?
963543,boombap,2016-03-22 21:22:00,310,"Been meaning to fish Lake O for a while...  But hows a deep V 80"" beam gonna handle it?"
963553,captpierre,2016-03-22 22:50:00,2521,Pick your days. A north wind is ok Anything out of the south or east is troublesome. Anything over 10-15 km wind is a deal breaker in a smaller boat.
963555,Freshtrax,2016-03-22 23:01:00,2215,"North wind is best on the north shore.  Check a few different sites for forecast.  As they are often wrong,  i say an east wind is the worst."
963576,Freshtrax,2016-03-23 01:34:00,2215,Yup I fish it 40 days a summer in a 22 ft glass boat  and there's days I've wished I stayed in bed.
963686,ehg,2016-03-23 19:52:00,2666,With 16 ft. boat you should have no problem getting to east outflow. We used to drag 12 ft. across ice from west side Frenchman's when frozen.  Good video of guys doing same thing getting to east outflow non-stop hammering fish. Met them out there before.  Prevailing winds north or northwest  most winter. It is winter fishery.  
963729,manitoubass2,2016-03-24 01:31:00,11391,Thought this was gonna be about that monster carp over in europe

Ya gotta get over east side Freshtrax.  Can't stop watching this video. This is exactly how we used to do it. 12 fter launched off lake shore when Frenchmans Bay frozen. Good view of east outflow mid winter. Didn't know the one guy was Aaron Shirley.  The other people with larger boats i chatted with launched from Bluffers Park and did run over. The fishing was that good. Fish every cast;  huge brown, walleye, rainbow, white bass, etc....every cast of lipless crank."
