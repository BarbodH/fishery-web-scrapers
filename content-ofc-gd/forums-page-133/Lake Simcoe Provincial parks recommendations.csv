964129,huzzsaba,2016-03-27 20:54:00,884,"Looking for info on Mcrae Provincial Park as well as Mara Provincial Park.  We are looking to book campsites in one of these parks for 3 nights since we are going on a very busy weekend (2nd weekend of July) and these 2 campgrounds have good amount of vacancy currently.  Both are rated at 3.5 stars on tripdvisor, not the best but beggers can't be choosers lol. They seem to be family oriented according to the reviews and that is what we are looking for. Also would like to know which park would be better for some shore fishing where I can just throw a pickeral rig with some minnows and leave it there. Any fishing is fine to be honest as long as the kids have fun.  Any reason we should avoid these parks or any one in particular?  Thanks in advance!"
