962933,Sterling,2016-03-17 23:09:00,477,"Welp, since nipissing is closed I'm thinking of hitting up watabeag Lake this weekend. Anyone know if watabeag road is open?"
963077,Joeytier,2016-03-18 22:01:00,3990,The one up by Kirkland?  Not sure there's any members living up that way.  Plenty of good easy access trout fishing close to north bay available right now.  Olrig (forest access) is plowed right to the power lines so all those splake lakes are an easy walk this year.
963078,hoby5,2016-03-18 22:08:00,42,There's many cottages on that lake the road in is very well maintained the access is in Matheson. No live bait to be had in that small town so bring some up with you. Hope that helps good luck! 
963091,Sterling,2016-03-18 23:52:00,477,"Thanks guys. I took the dive and went in blind, I'll know tonight or tomorrow if the road is passable."
963166,Sterling,2016-03-19 23:45:00,477,"If anyone's wondering, road is open all the way through.  The ""non-maintained"" southern section is dry and bare. The maintained section (north of Watabeag lake) is messy and bumpy."

963171,Joeytier,2016-03-19 23:50:00,3990,I'll PM you.
963407,adolson,2016-03-21 23:49:00,783,"Huh. Weird to see the name of a road I've fished down on here. Too bad I am a few days late. It was definitely open a few weeks ago, before any snow melted. Even the roads that intersect it were plowed. Lots of trout waters up that way, though I've only fished a couple of them so far.  ;)"

Worked on Watabeag for the ministry for years. Says he probably planted half of the trees we saw on the way through ."

Says he probably planted half of the trees we saw on the way through .  I'm in the Tri-Towns, but I like to explore for trouts. There are some aurora lakes west of Watabeag, which is what actually brought me to that area initially. Also caught a couple brookies that way. I went to Wynn Lake near KL a few years ago - don't bother. It's got a huge pike in there, maybe more than one.  Mostly I go into Latchford, Temagami, Matachewan, and Beauty Lake areas."
963587,Musky or Specks,2016-03-23 02:30:00,2710,Can confirm road is clear but bumpy from 66 to Matheson. Forty inches of ice on the lake we fished the past two days and lows of -22 both nights.
