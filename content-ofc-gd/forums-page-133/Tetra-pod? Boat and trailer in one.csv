964015,pics,2016-03-26 17:14:00,1268,There was one at the sportsman show. They are made in stoney creek.. it seems like a solid unit but it's a bit expensive ..
964026,dave524,2016-03-26 19:19:00,4508,Doesn't look like it would be road legal but load it up with decoys and it would be a dandy back country duck boat for beaver ponds and such if you got an ATV.
964028,Terry,2016-03-26 19:30:00,14456,you can buy it with road axle and tires or off road way cool but way too much money
964029,kickingfrog,2016-03-26 19:37:00,8333,"""Can't help paint Honey, I just have to take a load with the atv and I might not be back until late."""
964125,FishFinder17,2016-03-27 20:31:00,139,you can buy it with road axle and tires or off road way cool but way too much money   Do you know how much exactly?  Cool idea but wouldn't make a lot of sense if it is significantly more expensive than a 14ft aluminum/jon boat
964126,Terry,2016-03-27 20:32:00,14456,over 4000 bucks
964127,FishFinder17,2016-03-27 20:35:00,139,"over 4000 bucks   Yup, thats aggressive. Thanks Terry"
964128,misfish,2016-03-27 20:38:00,29133,I could build for less Im sure.
