962718,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 05:06:00,8243,"We call them "" Farm Animals"" here. Last year we had a flat line out 300 feet and guess who's turn it was? It feels like a Walleye even gives a flash of Walleye color 100 feet back. Nope farmfish's still a fish caught in my books regardlessof the guffaws from my mates."

962722,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 07:19:00,8243,"I'll take a nice 1 to 2 lb. Silver Bass or White Perch whatever you call them fresh any day for a nice feed, as good as perch fresh. A 2 day old fillet tastes like Cat food gone bad though. Never good out of the freezer too. When the Hydro Plant at Nanticoke was running you could catch them on a bare jig when they were running in April and fill a boat with them. 200 was our best day in 83', I thought we were going to sink the 15 footer. Those days are gonzo. Miss Wynne shut the plant and 400 jobs down because of the C02 emmisions waffting pollutants going to Ontario, Michigan, NY, PA and Ohio and maybe Kentucky too. You are more than welcomed. Really it was bad, we could see the brown crap going across the lake everyday heading for western NY. a good decision really.  It was announced this week a solar farm is going in on the site, a few hundred acres I read today. Better then nada but no warm water run off. If they take down the stacks I won't be able to know where the Walleye are. The standing joke out here is when you ask someone where they are hitting we say strait off the stacks. You can see the stacks from Erie PA. That's a lot off water."
962725,singingdog,2016-03-16 10:03:00,1047,"Don't overthink dropshot: it's just a different configuration of weight/hook (there are only 3) that allows for a suspended presentation. If a bait works on a splitshot, Trig, or on a jig, it will work on a dropshot. It doesn't have to be a downsized presentation. I sometimes dropshot full-sized flukes above a 1/2 to 3/4 oz weight as an alternative to pitching/flipping jigs."
962731,Acountdeleted,2016-03-16 12:17:00,2562,"Personally, though the VMC spinshot hooks can eliminate some line twist, I prefer tying hooks direct. The less knots the better IMO.  Dropshotting is versatile no doubt. Ever tried flipping docks with a dropshot? Use a 1/2 to 3/4 weigh and have your creature about 12"" up. You can flip it in and LEAVE it there for as long as you like without the bait burying itself in the weeds/mud. Stays up in the strike zone like a neutral buoyancy bait.   This is probably my favourite way to fish dropshot. Off of my buddies dock or in the current that flows from the river into my parents lake, its always been deadly."

If anyone does fish Erie for Smallies with live bait a live leech will out fish live minnows on any day other than fall, then it's the largest minnow you can get. Even a black twister tail grub Carolina, California, Jig and stinger rig or actually any style weight and to get the presentation down will do the trick with an artificial leech. I have used even a Pickerel rig with 2 leaches and hammered them drifting. They don't call me the Bassassin for nothin'. Go ahead laff out load. Thanks! I might take you up on that someday. Not sure my vessel is really seaworthy though, or at least something I should be taking out on Erie, unless it's within shouting distance of the boat launch though!"

First of all I fish Georgian Bay, which means that 5-10lb pike run ins are an ever day occurance so I run a much beefier set up. If there are pike in the lake you are fishing, I would stay the heck away from bothering with the finesse test. The water is also Gin clear and its absolutely normal to be able to see 30 feet down like looking through a window. I have no issues using heavier gear in water like this so the whole finesse deal is Bull to me...these are bass we are talking about, not browns.  This past year I would argue that i fished a drop shot nearly 80% of the time while hunting for smallies. In the fall I also used a drop shot 95% of the time while fishing for walleye. The only exception was morning top water, spring spinner baits and fall swimbaits on deep suspended fish chasing bait.  My go to rig is 20lb power pro, uni knotted to a 3 foot long 20lb fluro leader.  I have been using TTI stand out hooks https://www.ttiblakemore.com/product-category/standout-hooks/typically half way up the leader (can adjust all of this depending on where you are marking fish) I like the TTI stand up hooks because the hook keeps the bait on a perfect profile but also provides some meat to your hookset, typically the fish hit it and dont come off  to pencil or regular drop shot weights as long as they have a swivel. Whatever you do, i suggest you use as little weight as possible while still allowing you to get down and stay still. If its windy like it is on GB nearly every single day or you are fishing current, you have to go a little heavier with the weight to stay put.  My favourite technique is to literally deadstick the bait...then wiggle it ever so slightly, then put it right back to dead stick. Keep your weight sitting on bottom but put tension on the rod...your line needs to be tight, but your weight still needs to be on bottom. When a bass hits your rod will set the fish itself and typically wont come off.   Baits...pretty much your preference, i had luck this year with live bait, berkley hollow bodies and jackall cross tail shads (personal fave)  Also looking forward to trying out some Gulp alive on the drop as well."

The stacker rigs included. Seems like they would do ok through the ice as well (cleaner presentation than conventional pickerel/perch rig). Going to see if I can locate these in Canada.  Edit: OK I can't find these anywhere in Canada. Someone needs to supply me a source before I cave and buy in USD."
962748,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 14:09:00,8243," We can no longer get soft shell crabs here but they are deadly almost to the point of being not fair for Smallies. And at the price they were charging hooking a Sheepshead drove me insane, more insane. I did have the kids down the laneway catch me them and even they were starting to charge outrageous prices.  Good point not over thinking the dropshot method, a weight on the bottom and a hook tied onto a line. Can't get much simpler than that. I really had to laugh when I saw specific ""Dropshot"" weights being sold and not cheap either. The cheapest ""dropshot"" weight is when I Gorilla glue a Robertson on the bottom of my line or tie it on well just as you would tie on a snelled hook on a harness. Hard to get a snag and when it does I just break it off. I like the green deck screws myself."

I'll gladly catch more bass in exchange for a maybe getting bit off.  I lived up there and fished GB 3 times a week for 16 years. In gin clear water it absolutely 100% makes a difference if you use thinner fluorocarbon.

963389,Hedfish,2016-03-21 20:15:00,76,"Youtube is your friend, there are lots of videos on how to drop shot, here is one of them:    I just tie a hook using Palomar knot. With Palomar, it's easy to control the length of the line that goes down to the sinker. And if the hook ends up upside down, just run the sinker end of the line through the eye of the hook again.  Another variation is to attach a hook to a leader, tie a loop on the leader, like double surgeon, and then tie that leader to the main line, similar to the way you tie the hook when drop shotting. This gives the hook a bit more lively presentation. Or instead of attaching the leader by the loop, to eliminate line twist, you can use a T thingy, forgot what they called, lol."
962544,Spanky80,2016-03-14 21:14:00,152,"This year after reading for years about the effectiveness of drop shotting, I've decided to rig up and give it a try.  I fish a very clear lake in my area, and I know there are big smallies there, I've had limited success with the standard crankbait/tube jig approach.  Any pointers?  Line, hook size/make, technique you've used with success?  Thanks!"
962551,manitoubass2,2016-03-14 21:43:00,11391,"I normally use 8-12 lb braid, then a 6-8lb flouro leader. I like those vmc swivel hooks.  Various weights for different depths. Ill ise ball sinkers in current, pencil sinkers on calm days on the lake.  Use your electonics to mark fish and play around abit with techniques or leader length.  But typically I like mine about 14-18"", with the hooke about 8"" up, but that depends where in the water column the fish are.  Great technique for bass, walleye and lakers, heck even crappie lol"

962608,OhioFisherman,2016-03-15 03:36:00,6623,"It's been a long time since I could fish, I used 8# test Berkley Vanish if the water was real clear.

The straight drop shot weight will probably get snagged less on a rocky bottom, or you can use the same style in a slip sinker and peg it with a rubber worm sinker peg, the line will slip out with constant pressure.  How deep of water are you trying to fish? I have caught smallies in a foot or two of water, but usually in the early spring or at night."
962623,Lape0019,2016-03-15 12:23:00,647,I use 20lb braid and tie on a rather long leader. Why 20lb? because I don't have a dedicated rod for it and it doesn't seem to affect anything. Many people are starting to drop shot with baitcast equipment but I cannot stand it. I prefer using spinning gear for this technique because of how I hold the reel. I find it much more comfortable to hold a spinning reel for long period of time than to palm a baitcaster over the same period.
962625,manitoubass2,2016-03-15 12:47:00,11391,Thats a good addition! I too prefer spinning gear unless im dropshotting deep for lakers then in baitcaster all the way

They are pricey but I currently use the Gamakatsu Swivel shot G-finesse hooks. With the line clip design going to the sinker and using the same line clip design drop shot weights, you only need to tie 1 knot on the hook.  As stated before, these hooks are not cheap but the stand up well. I managed to land a 4 foot sturgeon on one this year. a total incidental catch while dropshotting for smallies but it goes to show you that these hooks will handle anything a bass will throw at them."
962636,netminder,2016-03-15 14:16:00,514,I'm feeling the same way as the OP. Something I've wanted to try and never got around to. From a distance it's a technique that seems foolproof as long as you can get the depth right.  I've seen specific drop shot rods for sale too. What's special about them that wouldn't be true for a typical spincast rod?  Any recommendations on bait?
962641,Dave Bailey,2016-03-15 14:49:00,1641,"Personally, though the VMC spinshot hooks can eliminate some line twist, I prefer tying hooks direct. The less knots the better IMO.  Yeah, same here, I call my set-up 'quick and dirty'. Just put a hook a couple of feet up the line with a palomar knot, and weights on the bottom. You can use split shot, but I've gone to proper drop shot weights because if they get hung up they will just pull off without wrecking the whole rig, ditto for rubber core."

962654,Lape0019,2016-03-15 16:22:00,647,"Netminder,  The big difference would more than likely be sensitivity and an extra-fast tip to feel the subtle takes. As for baits, the ones Ohio fisherman listed are the general shape of what is used up here too but really, anything can be used. Last year, I used a lot of Jackal Cross tail shads and some set the hook baits that I cannot remember the name of. Quite similar to the cross tail though."
962656,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-15 16:44:00,8243,I did go out and buy some drop shot hooks last year for Perch. Since each hook takes 2 ties I got tired of tying hooks and went back to a simple Pickerel rig set up. Besides that I got out fished by my buddies on the boat when I was using the drop shot hooks. I was getting plenty of bumps but not as many hook ups. I need to snorkel next time and see what goes on. I think if a fish takes the bait on the opposite side of where the hook is facing they hit the line and scamper off. I like the hook to be free 360 degrees. Plus a live bait on a tight line won't swim around as freely. I know that's what the swivel is for but if ain't broke why spend money to fix it. Just my opinion.

962668,SuperDave,2016-03-15 19:54:00,204,started dropshotting for smallies a few years back. Deadly method when you need to slow down. Don't think that you have to only use vertically. In the Niagara river I cast it up current and let it bounce and drag along bottom. Caught some nice fish that way. Also caught fish in 3 ft. of water when I saw them right under the boat. Just dropped it down and WHAM! fish on! My buddy was thinking I was crazy drop shotting in 3ft but next thing I new he was doing it to and we were giggling as we caught one after another. A spinning outfit is perfect for it. I also bought a St.Croix drop shot rod which has a super sensitive tip so you feel even the slightest bite.Try it and have fun.
