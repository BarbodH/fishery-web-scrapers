I took a picture of it today, and it,s still standing tall. Im always keeping one eye on the float and one on the tree.  It,s amazing the strength of the roots .  "

On the rez I removed about 300 trees on the pow wow site to make room for a new parking lot/camping.  I was kinda shocked and really had to watch what I was doing. Sometimes Id go to remove a tree and another tree 10ft away would start tipping with it"
