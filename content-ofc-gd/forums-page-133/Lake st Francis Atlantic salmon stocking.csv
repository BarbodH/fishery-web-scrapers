963662,mike rousseau,2016-03-23 16:52:00,4661,Now I think this is rediculous but I just saw a local news video showing the local First Nations tribe stocking Atlantic salmon into several tribs leading into the lake st Francis portion of the st lawrence river...  Hope the musky don't develope an appetite for em... Lol
963666,BillM,2016-03-23 17:05:00,17367,"Browns like to eat them, I'd guess the muskie will as well"
963667,grimsbylander,2016-03-23 17:15:00,3016,Those St. Lawrence musky can get huge...just imagine adding a daily dose of omega-3 to their diet. LOL

963865,CBB,2016-03-25 01:33:00,10,Hope they stock them on the res so maybe it will keep them there instead of spearing walleye on our Hoople Creek spawning beds that we put in.
963905,mike rousseau,2016-03-25 14:15:00,4661,We stopped the spearing on the raisin river...  We got land owners to put up no trespassing signs and press charges for trespassing.... MNR and OPP helped support this for the 2 week spawning period...
963965,CBB,2016-03-25 23:41:00,10,MNR owns the land and they guard the Indians as they spear and net almost every night and then cross back over the Border and sell the fish. It is just plain stupid and if they want to do what their ancestors did then do it the way they did it and not with modern convinces of Lights and Trucks.
