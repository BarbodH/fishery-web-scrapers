Thanks for the link. l was concerned about the resistance in the wire, looks like that is not an issue, at least not with Airmar. Basically it is a splash proof secure connection, I can make a better connection by soldering crimp sleeves and covering it with double wall heat shrink tubing."
963362,wkrp,2016-03-21 14:07:00,656,Who carries the airmar transducers in the GTA. It may be worth looking into when a replacement is necessary.
963365,G.mech,2016-03-21 14:32:00,830,Who carries the airmar transducers in the GTA. It may be worth looking into when a replacement is necessary.  Radioworld sells them but they are listed under your unit manufacturers name (not 'Airmar') on their site.  Here is the P-66 for example that works with Lowrance:  http://radioworld.ca/p66-bl-p-1385.html

963409,Terry,2016-03-22 00:00:00,14456,i have a P-66  and i find it no better then the lowrance ducer and if you google reviews of the airmar transducers you will find many find them a waste of money for freshwater uses
963420,NANUK,2016-03-22 01:11:00,797,"I have the opposite experience with P66, Specially when down rigging the difference is like night & day, a crisper sonar image with lot more detail, not to mention it has already lasted twice as long as lowrance and still going strong."
963426,G.mech,2016-03-22 01:30:00,830,"The Airmar P66 is a transom mounted dual frequency transducer that operates at either 50 or 200 kHz.  It is intended to replace the stock Lowrance transducers sold with Elite & HDS units. The Lowrance transducers sold for shallower fresh water applications are dual frequency  83/200 kHz (such as the HST-WSBL).  They will both work on your Lowrance HDS units and both have the same cone angles at 200Hz (about 20 degrees) but when used at the at the lower frequencies (50 for the Airmar and 83kHz for the Lowrance) they perform much differently (the 50kHz gives you a wider cone angle but much less detail).  I personally feel the 83 is more suitable for most fresh water applications but Airmar does not make an 83/200 so you kind of have to make a choice.  That said, the stock Lowrance 'ducers do seem to have a limited lifespan and supposedly the Airmars are much more stable over the long haul.  Likely, both new out of the box would perform similarly but from what I gather, the Lowrance 'ducers fade over time much more than the Airmars do.  Ballpark costs are 200 bones for the Airmar and about 85 bucks for the WSBL.  Not sure if that helps at all, but that's what I have learned with a bit of research.....I have two WSBL's mounted on my stern and one is dead so I think I'll replace it with an Airmar and do a side by side comparison.  In between playing with the toys, maybe I'll find a spare moment to actually catch a fish or two..."
963430,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-22 01:50:00,8243,Good to know we can cut and splice on a new transducer. I have come to learn accuracy is the accuracy of depth and not sensitivity.

962972,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 06:59:00,8243,"I don't know if I read it here or another forum but someone passed on some info that may help boaters. While trailering the boat transducers should be protected from scratches incurred by road debris that will effect the signal to your unit. Simply cover the transducer with a sock to prevent scratches. Sounds logical to me. An easy and cheap way to keep them clean. A right hand sock for starboard and a left sock for the other side. Apparently Humminbirds are more prone to scratching of which I have one.  edit: It was Steve here on the thread about Humminbird vs, Lorance. Thanks Steve."

963030,Steve,2016-03-18 15:12:00,2075,"you will find that the debris on the road will never destroy your transducer....just slightly weaken the power of the transducer over time...  so after a few years, you think everything is working properly....but one day you think to yourself ""gee, I don't see my rigger balls like I used to on this finder..."" and attribute it to blow back or something else....  than one day you have a friend who has the same, or similar unit to you, but brand new. You say hey, can I throw my head unit on your boat and all of a sudden your unit is marking tons more than what it marked on your boat.....  transducer is the culprit...its only operating at 60% of its strength.....  not easy to notice unless you fish in a way that marks a constant...like rigger balls."
963036,Terry,2016-03-18 15:39:00,14456,Yet I believe You would have to see marks on the ducer for it to do damage Years ago the high power units would heat up and the ceramics would come Off the glue.  Then driving down the road would make it  rattle around and do more damage.  But the newer units don't heat up like they use to

963049,Steve,2016-03-18 17:39:00,2075,"Sinker, transducers absolutely have a lifetime...i'd wager anything older than four/five years (or much less with heavy towing) would be a transducers max.  And definitely lowrance transducers seem to lose their power quicker than hbird transducers.  A good friend of mine just had to replace his transducer on this hds7. He bought it the first year they came out....what was that, about four/five years ago?"
963059,Sinker,2016-03-18 18:37:00,8692,"Yup, I have replaced many of them, both lowrance and birds. I guess it depends how much you use them. I use mine year round, and I think icefishing is when they take the most beating. Bouncing in the sleigh doing 40km/h down the lake wrecks gear!  S."

963142,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 18:53:00,8243,"I was always told never to cut a transducer wire. I am now told it is done all the time on digital units not analogue and can be rewired if you have good solder skills. I don't know if they exist but it would be nice to be able to have a transducer that plugs in just like on the main unit. I know I don't want to fish in a new line, what a pain it was on my Star Craft with the live wells to bypass. I was ready to drill holes in them.  Off topic because this is my thread so there. I had the lakeside windows and doors open and put a spring jacket on and headed out. I went down the road 300 meters to a pals. When I got out of the truck it felt like I fell through the ice. North wind blowing like mad and it was -10C. What a difference wind can make, especially in the spring. The boys headed out on Lake O without me a few days ago and only lasted an hour on the lake because of the cold wind and not dressed for it, you can always take clothes off but can't put them on if you don't bring it. Serves then right for not taking me."
963143,BassMan11,2016-03-19 19:00:00,583,So hold on a minute...... if I buy a $300 Helix 5 with down imaging I am going to have to purchase a $175 transducer every 5 years to make sure it working to its best ability? Yikes... glad I don't have the $300 structure scan unit.
