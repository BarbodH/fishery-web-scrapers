963329,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 02:39:00,8243,Why are they going there now? Great Briton never had a trade embargo with Cuba as Canada didn't either. I have been to Cuba many times since 1975. Many items on the shelves in Habana with Our Compliments and Presidents Choice on the label. Why now?
963338,darsky,2016-03-21 03:40:00,586,either way it has to be a free event as very few Cuban could afford their tickets even at a lower price. Maybe free future healthcare?
963339,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 04:32:00,8243,"Afford a ticket? Those poor folks can't afford a CD. I go every 4 or5 years and bring a suitcase full of stuff for the folks at the hotel. I always bring as much tackle as I can fit in my bags. You would flip if you saw the hooks these people use to fish with. Rusted, worn down, it's sad. I bring cheap mono and old tackle for them and you would think I gave them a new car. I brought 2 old baseball gloves there a few years ago and gave them to a bartender I met to give to his sons, he cried like a baby. If you ever go down what ever you bring for them is like winning a lottery for the working folks.  The only ones going to that concert are the elites from the Government or the 1% that have 99% of the wealth. Not an average working Cuban, no way, no how. That notion is ridiculous.  As far as health care I can tell you they are in good care at least. I broke my hand years ago and had better care than I would have had here. Cost? nada.  edit: Oh don't get me going about Cuba, do you know that if a Cuban citizen gets caught with a Caribbean Rock lobster in their position they can be imprisoned for 5 years? Lobsters are for us tourists. It's like being beamed down on another planet if you get off the resort and spend some time there. I have a pal that has lived there for 35 years and spent time with him off the reservation. He pays 400 bucks a month for a 2 bedroom apt. and that includes maid service. He makes his money exporting cigars to the US. The embargo was a joke."

963383,darsky,2016-03-21 18:27:00,586,those 7 and 8 hundred dollar vacays are soon to be a thing of the past.
963384,leaf4,2016-03-21 19:03:00,2466, Won't be for at least 10 years they say
