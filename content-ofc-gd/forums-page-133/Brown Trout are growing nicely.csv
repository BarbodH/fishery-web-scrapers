I read on another site they are doing some brown stocking in the quinte region of 40,000 total Browns and some pens for imprinting the chinooks !!!! And some of the Browns are of different sizes and will make an even better area down there awesome for the brown fishery !!!!?"

963950,spinnerbaitking,2016-03-25 22:06:00,1622,"Just curious, is there any evidence of them having a successful spawn outside of a hatchery there? I know they are returning to the area they were released in, as I've seen a few different sizes from about 14"" to high 20""s in the one area & as many as 12 or 15 a few years that I checked."
963951,misfish,2016-03-25 22:09:00,29133,Awesome Richard.  Cant wait for the video of the kids releasing them .

You do have an advantage with cooler water temps up there, and from the few rivers I have seen that emptied into the Georgian Bay, there doesn't seem to be the problem with silt from farming activity in the spring. Our rivers have a tendency to turn brown after a rain, and it's worse in the spring once the farms have been plowed."
