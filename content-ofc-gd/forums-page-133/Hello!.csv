963881,FishFinder17,2016-03-25 04:06:00,139,"Hi All,  I just joined the forums and wanted to say hello. I've been following for the past year or so and finally decided to join. I've picked up a lot of useful information from some of your posts so I must say thanks - I'll contribute whatever I can in return.  I do the majority of my fishing at my family cottage near Gravenhurst but often venture to the Kawarthas. I'm always looking to catch new fish but mainly target pike, bass and the odd musky. My boat is and older one but it's a 16ft Tracker with upgraded electronics/trolling motor so it gets the job done. I just picked up a GoPro this offseason so I plan to share some videos this summer.  I've added a pic of one of my better pike from last season. I'm looking forward to a great 2016 fishing season!  FF17 "
