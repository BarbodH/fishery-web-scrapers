963122,Garcia96,2016-03-19 12:51:00,45,Was wondering if these 2 are the exact same creek or branch differently. I see in the regulation book they have the same opener date but always thought they were 2 different creeks???
963136,pike slayer,2016-03-19 17:39:00,1177,Are you speaking of the creeks along the ranger lake rd?
963139,Musky or Specks,2016-03-19 18:08:00,2710,"SAME CREEK, iTS KNOWN AS HORNER ABOVE PRINCETON. OPENER WOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL STREAMS IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL."
963140,Garcia96,2016-03-19 18:10:00,45,No I'm trying to locate Horner creek but whitemans creek pops up and was told it was in Drumbo? But can't seem to find it in maps
963195,niagara jeep,2016-03-20 08:02:00,20,"You mean fourth Saturday, not last."

963219,tender52,2016-03-20 15:13:00,270,Horner flows into whitemans a little northwest of drumbo. I wouldnt get to excited about it Ontario out of doors did a write up about it some 8 years ago and its been fished to crap. It was a good spot before everybody and their brother goes there now
