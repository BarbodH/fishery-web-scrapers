963922,bigcreekdad,2016-03-25 16:28:00,546,Grimsby...must be the show Ron James is in....can't watch him.
963926,Oggie,2016-03-25 16:44:00,588,They'll join the hunting show fate unless something changes.  I don't watch them anymore.  They make 6 shows and then try to cover the timeslot for the year with the same 6 shows.
963937,Grimace,2016-03-25 18:16:00,2020,"Don't be so negative.  At least it wasn't some guy trying as hard as he could to generate a marketable fake laugh while shilling Rapalas, wait no, live targets."
963944,Fishwilly,2016-03-25 19:59:00,206,  Not just me….google BFSC fishing….very good videos….very good! Yeah I'm a fan of Kevin (member here) and his BFSC channel....the triple header salmon gets me primed for sure.

At least it wasn't some guy trying as hard as he could to generate a marketable fake laugh while shilling Rapalas, wait no, live targets.      For the most part I prefer shows that showcase bass and walleye fishing in Ontario. This is where I live and fish and any little tid-bit I can pick up on is a bonus for me.  yea......I get that the host is hawking his sponsors and really try to look past that as best as I can.  I don't care if the host is using a 3/4oz. Strike King Greg Hackney Platinum Signature Series Super Penetrateor Slop Master flipping jig, I do care about the 3/4oz. jig part. It's a starting point for me. Same with rods and reels. Length, action and gear ratio please.  All measuring sticks to compare what I'm using with what they are using."
964052,cola050,2016-03-27 03:05:00,4,If we're talking shows Fishn Canada is still a must watch for me. It's been one of my favs for years. Fishful Thinking is another I watch most Saturdays. If you like muskies Keyes Outdoors on youtube is definitely worth checking out.

964162,bigcreekdad,2016-03-28 00:46:00,546,Watching installment #2 of Uncut Angling now (after #1)...awesome!! Thanks for the tip folks. Any other gems out there? 
963472,azen,2016-03-22 13:24:00,7,"Severely bored. Any fishing shows on Rogers cable? If so, what channel, day and time are they on.  Thanks"
963474,Shloim,2016-03-22 13:32:00,515,Global Saturday mornings there is a few hours worth back to back
963475,Gallie,2016-03-22 13:39:00,1215,"I have a hard time watching most of the fishing shows on now, too much mishandling of the fish setting a bad example for everyone else. I have musky hunter set to pvr other than that i might check whats on but i rarely watch wfn anymore."
963476,MJL,2016-03-22 13:39:00,2427,"Youtube is your friend...Many TV shows have uploaded full length shows on youtube (eg. FishTV, The Real Fishing Show, Canadian Sportfishing, etc)"
963488,lookinforwalleye,2016-03-22 14:58:00,4399,well watching a few boring fishing shows is sure to help your boredom.....
963495,manitoubass2,2016-03-22 15:26:00,11391,Uncut angling is the only show I watch these days and its all on youtube
963498,acplumber,2016-03-22 15:46:00,28,X2 for uncut angling I watched 39hrs in 2 sittings Even my wife got into it. And she could care less for fishing shows
963514,BassMan11,2016-03-22 17:27:00,583,Uncut is by far the best fishing show out there but when it comes to T.V. I do watch a couple.  - Linders Angling edge (minus the last 5 minutes) - Facts of fishing - Musky Hunter - Timmy Horton Outdoors - The next bite  All of these shows have the their product placement parts but I at least find these ones somewhat informal on techniques and somewhat interesting at times. Unfortunately almost all of them are only on WFN.
963536,netminder,2016-03-22 20:35:00,514,"Has Uncut Angling made an episode since 39 hours? I check back every so often but there isn't ever anything on there.  As for TV shows, the Saturday morning Global TV lineup might as well be listed as paid programming. The only show on there that comes close to being educational is Fishin' Canada. But after watching it I get this odd urge to buy a Ram with Cooper Tires and drive to Sail. But Facts of Fishing is on Saturday morning on Sportsnet360 which makes it nice because I don't even need to pay attention to see the start of it as I'm watching sports highlights lol."
963547,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-22 21:36:00,8243,99% of the shows out there are 30 minute infomercials. I cancelled WFN years ago.   Very well said. If you are that bored go fishing or ask an elderly neighbour if you can do a few chores for them.
963551,huzzsaba,2016-03-22 22:32:00,884,Uncut angling is the only show I watch these days and its all on youtube  I will start watching this one from tonight!
963552,pics,2016-03-22 22:46:00,1268,I enjoy the odd fishing show but it depends on species... I just can't watch bass fishing...
963600,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-23 07:00:00,8243,"I watched the final 39 hours, episode 6 of Uncut Angling 39 hrs just today. I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. At the end of episode 6 the date of the next show is on. April 5th."
963637,Rizzo,2016-03-23 15:11:00,4754,"youtube is pretty much all I ever do. Have watched every single musky clip ever recorded by mankind, as well as the 39 hours episodes. Even my kids got into that one."
963670,bigugli,2016-03-23 17:26:00,6138,Gotta love them fishing infomercials. It's what's helping to keep cable TV alive
963674,mike rousseau,2016-03-23 17:42:00,4661,I've developed a good list of subscriptions on YouTube that give me my fishing show fix when I need it...
963690,grimsbylander,2016-03-23 20:13:00,3016,Nothing more exciting than watching two guys fishing a northern lake catching 2lb walleye that look like they came out of a photo copy machine. Oh! good one!!! It's identical to the other 50 you caught!!!!!! Zzzzzzz
963694,limeyangler,2016-03-23 20:39:00,5204,some people on this forum also have youtube channels

Quite true, except you forgot the Muskol... I pvr so I can fast forward through the commercials. I get through a bunch of shows pretty quick for my fix."
