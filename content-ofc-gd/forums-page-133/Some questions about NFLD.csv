963245,Musky or Specks,2016-03-20 17:45:00,2710,The trans Labrador Highway is now great. Just make sure it's after all the frost heaves. The rough road is from Manicougan5 to Fermont .
963256,Big Cliff,2016-03-20 18:10:00,6899,"My wife and I honeymooned in Newfoundland. Ten days, landed in St John, rented a car and drive the bonavista peninsula up to twilingate area, up to gros morne, and back.  We're very active, lots of hiking and talking to locals about the local hidden spots. Here's some of my thoughts based on what you've said:  - camping? The provincial parks are the cheapest at around $12./night and great accommodations (washrooms and showers) as most people are RVing. Private campgrounds are hit/miss in quality. The national park is expensive in comparison.  - in grand falls Windsor there's a great bed and breakfast called the carriage house. It's an excellent stop between at Johns and gros morne. - I hope you will consider some hiking. Nothing epic or crazy in elevation changes, but bare minimum I recommend getting out and walking the tablelands and the brief walk to the Western Brook pond. Take the boat tour as you'll Anjou some of the Marine history and fishing studies in the pond.  -consider the skerwink trail on the bonavista peninsula. It's not grueling and gives some great coastal views without any crowds.  I can't comment on fishing or other types as we did things in the You may be surprised how little advertising there is once there despite all of the tourism ads here. Aside from St John's, people generally aren't trying to sell you things... And it's great. I have to run for now, but one last thing -- book your Gros morne and St John's stays in advance.  Edit: apologies for tense and grammar errors. Typing on phone with baby in one hand! Wow, thanks for the info. No apologies necessary and congrats on the baby! As for the hiking, that isn't going to happen unfortunatly, I'm 70, Sue is 69 and neither of us can do a lot of walking anymore. I am surprised that the camp grounds are so reasonable I wonder if driving there and then renting a small trailer would be a cost effective way of doing the trip? Anyone tried it?"
963311,jayess,2016-03-20 23:33:00,187,"And thanks for the congrats! OK, based on what you've said, maybe write off the Skerwink trail...  I'll try to iron out some recommendations below based on areas that we visited.  Gros Morne National Park  Seeing the tabl lands in Gros Morne Natl Park is worth doing. They do provide guided tours as well. The terrain is as rough as you want it to be in that there are some really smooth trails that you can walk, or you can also go off the beaten path. The attraction here is the geology of the area. The rocks are unique to this region  (""the Earth's mantle turned inside out"" is one way they describe it). Up to you if that's your cup of tea.  Western Brook Pond involves a flat-ground walk of a few km to the boat tours. It's a must-do for a guy who's curious about fishing. You buy your tickets at the actual pond (at the end of the walk).  If you do find yourself up Gros Morne way (which you should!), check whether the Gros Morne Theatre Festival is under way. We went to a play in Cow Head in this small, 100-seat theatre that was absolutely fantastic... Very, very well done.  Further north is L'Anse aux meadows. We didn't go there because it sound like a stale attraction (we wanted hiking and that sort of activity), but that's a way up the coast from Gros Morne proper. Take a peek at the map and plan accordingly because that's the only thing up there, really.  Another area we visited was Trout Creek in Gros Morne. There was a restaurant recommendation out that way and I'm a sucker for chowder. The restaurant was meh but the added history to that trek is its the site of some whale beachings a few years back. I believe the ROM paid for one of these carcasses to be shipped back to Ontario and it's currently buried underground in southern Ontario to get all of the gunk off and get down to the bones for proper display.  In Rocky Harbour, there's this little restaurant/store that advertises ""the best fish cakes"" on the island. From our tastebuds, they were. There's also a large fresh water lake with public access just outside the town (ask a local). There are specks in the lake but I think you'd need a boat to have much proper luck. We went for the swim which was nice.   Grand Falls-Windsor  As stated, consider the Carriage House. Gordon Pinsent stays (or stayed?) there frequently. The owner is lovely and the rooms are nice and at a decent rate.  St John's - Johnson Geo Center in Saint John's: A must-do if you're at all interested in science. LOTS of geology stuff with great tours. They also have a big exhibit about off-shore refinery, tar sands, and so on. I can't remember what else is there but our only regret is that we didn't think it'd take so long and were under-packed for lunch. - The Rooms: Google search it for the best description, but it's kind of like a museum on NFLD people and culture that's largely being stitched together by the public's own contribution of memoirs, ancestry, and artifacts. Pretty cool if you're into some short stories, but not terrible if you miss it either. - Restaurant recommendations in Saint John's: Raymond's if you're looking to treat yourself (friends gave us a gift certificate, we other couldn't afford such eating), Get Stuffed if you're looking for a solid restaurant with great prices and good on the palette - Check out George St... Even if you're not the bar type, there's something for everyone. My wife and I hit a blues bar and it had some solid talent. Ask to get yourself screeched in -- it's a tradition out there that's kinda funny, depending on your tolerance of silliness.  Bonavista Peninsula  If you drive through this peninsula, here are my thoughts: - Trinity is a nice little town with a great chocolate shop (Aunt Sarah's) and a nice little cafe restaurant. You can walk right into the old village buildings (the church, in particular).  They also have the Rising Tide Theatre, but there were no shows playing on the day we were there. There's also a mussel farm clearly visible as you drive into town. - Lockston Path PP was our favourite park to stay at. Up the road is some private resort called Paradise something or other... stay away. - In Bonavista proper (on the tip) there's an old-fashioned movie theatre that's a lovely little experience. If you continue driving outside of town, the Dungeon is really worth checking out again from a geology perspective. It's a cool spectacle!  Twillingate  You can see icebergs year round, no matter what people say. The bergs get stuck in the harbours around this area of the island. As you're approaching Twillingate, stop at the tourist information centre and ask them for recent spottings. Driving down some dead-end roads, we were able to get great shots.  If you go to the Twillingate, you have to see Melvin's Museum in Durrell. Me telling you more about this guy will really take away from the experience, but he's a great guy who can tell you all about the cod fishery in the early days. Bring a small memento for his museum and if there's an iceberg in the area, he'll gladly take you out in his boat. Many famous folk have visited his museum and they all have left photos, mementos, etc. Do it!  There's a small clubhouse kind of like our Rotary clubs in Twillingate proper that does old fashioned shows (dancing, singing, silly comedy). Not a bad little date night to soak in some local culture.  Misc. Tips "
963317,Sinker,2016-03-21 00:43:00,8692,"Thats great info from a tourists point of view. Good stuff.  All i want to do when i get there is go home. The whole tourist thing doesnt appeal to me at all. The last time i was there, i stayed 3 weeks, and never left my dads property except to make a beer run or go out in the boat. I grew up 5 miles from lanse aux meadows and have never been there. I hear its pretty great though.....  S."
963320,chris.brock,2016-03-21 01:15:00,4053,"You're gonna love it Cliff.  I've been twice. My favorite attraction was taking the road from Port Aux Basques towards Borgeo along Red Indian Lake. Pull over and camp wherever you want, have as big a campfire as you want, and pluck Atlantic Salmon from the rivers you cross."
963331,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 02:54:00,8243,"I guess flights to Newfieland are dear. A flight from Hamilton to Halifax is cheap. The last time I went 2 years ago was 350 return each from Hamilton on West Jet. Less than the price of gas let alone rooms and wear and tear on the car. I wouldn't take my 4X4 that was under warranty because of the fuel cost and the car is getting up there in K's and I worry about a breakdown. Heck a tranny now is 4 grand or more. So now I always fly and rent where ever I go. Years ago I flew to California and did the US 1 coastal highway for a 4 week break. Bought a nice classic for $1000.00 bucks in Sacramento and registered it and then insured it from here, on the way to the airport I sold it at a lot for 600 bucks cash. Think outside the box."
963335,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 03:06:00,8243,"Fly to Halifax and buy an older van, vehicles are cheaper out there. Sell it when you are done or drive it back and sell it for a profit. Fed Ex your stuff to Halifax and Fed X it back home. Like I said think outside the box."
963341,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 05:11:00,8243,What a great post from Jayess. He should be working for the Newfoundland and Labrador dept. of Tourism. That's enough info for me to spend a year there.

963393,Big Cliff,2016-03-21 20:43:00,6899," That's why we are doing Nova Scotia and PEI this year and Nfld next.. I'll get Sue to dig out our notes on NS & PEI, we had such a wonderful time it was actually hard for us not to just go back. While we loved everywhere we went I have to say PEI was probably the best for us, we got there and didn't want to leave at all. Fishing for cod and mackerel (and I caught plenty $45.00 for a half day and they cleaned them and everything. The clam digging excursion was a little expensive, $75.00/person but they took us out and we spent a few hours digging clams, then went back to their house and had a wonderful dinner, fresh steamed clams, clam chowder, (there was other food too but I can't even remember all of it, I ate so many clams I could hardly walk LOL). We found a really nice little motel right in Charlottetown was about $75.00 a night, clean quiet, beautiful gardens, 5 minutes to Walmart........ 1 minute walk to Tims."
963396,floater,2016-03-21 21:12:00,220,"We did the Labrador drive three years ago in July. Still some 0 degree nights but no issues. The gravel road was in better condition than most roads in Toronto. The only bad part was for  about 50 km just outside of Happy Valley  as they were still in the process of blasting and digging. Took 4 hours to go the 50 km but they just kept pulling all the equipment out of the way as we went along. Free camping along it's entire length in any of the gravel pits. Best road side fishing ever. Pike and Lake trout in every single culvert/lake we stopped at. A whole bunch of brook trout as well. It was 13 hours from Toronto to the ferry at Matane, QC. Only had one night where we got eaten alive by mosquitos. The tent trailer had 7 blown tires over this trip as the gravel road really heated the tires. Luckily we found 5 tires and rims for sale in Happy Valley but they all burst too but still made it back. NFL camping was about 40 bucks a night with full amenities."
963603,blue pickeral,2016-03-23 11:18:00,267,"  If you start sight-seeing in the Maritimes(Cabot Trail etc) you'll never make it to Nfld. Agree generally, however as the ferry crossing costs you two days - assuming day crossing - night before motel - cross all day - night in motel on landing. A drive around Cabot Trail uses the time spent waiting for your pre-crossing motel (in this case in North Sydney)  Drive the Cabot Trail clockwise - best scenary this way and what a drive it will be, with a stop for lunch at this place:  http://www.rustyanchor.co/    which is about half way around. Make sure you have good brakes for the trip - many steep hills as road hugs the coast line.  (they advertise the lobster rolls at the Rusty Anchor - while very good, are not using the authentic bun bread as they do in Maine)"
963987,ch312,2016-03-26 04:31:00,1590,"I've spent 4 weeks total in NFLD and it's a great place. I really enjoyed picking mussels and snails, jigging for cod and mackerel, casting into pools with so many brookies the water was black, seeing moose every other day, viewing whales a few different times, getting within spitting distance of a 15 ft basking shark, and hanging out with very nice people. Lobster straight from the traps into the boiling water on the beach is heavenly.  The best way to see the rock is to make friends with a newfie around your home town and get them to set you up with people back home in NFLD. They'll likely let you stay for free, feed you until you're ready to burst, and force you to have a good time..."

962989,Big Cliff,2016-03-18 10:44:00,6899,"So Sue and I have decided that this summer we are finally going to get to NFLD. We had thought about doing the trip in a motor home but want to explore other options as well.  Both of us are enamored by the beauty of the pictures we have seen of some of the coastal villages, the colors, the settings and that is something we’d like to see.  We aren’t into museums, art galleries, fancy restraints, neither of us can walk any distance so hiking trails and walking tours are out of the question.  Here is what we would like in no particular order:  Digging clams (we’d need some help in knowing where, what, how, when……) Catching crabs (again, lots of help needed LOL) Fishing for cod, mackerel, (anything) but I’m not after trophies, just want to spend some time on the water and catch some fish. Party boat style fishing is fine with me too. Oh, and lobster, lots of lobster LOL.  Smaller communities where we could rent an apartment or efficiency motel unit, visit the pier and/or the pub; just hang out and absorb the atmosphere.  Thoughts, ideas, suggestions would be very welcome!"

You know the commercial where it says call ""Irene"" or somebody that is still on once and a while, I called the number and sent the package tout suite. We only got as far as Cape Breton where we could spend a year there in Nova Scotia. Her sister lived there then. We rented an SUV in Halifax and did that coast 360 degrees. I brought a few rods and reels and assorted tackle and caught plenty of fish from docks, streams and bridges etc. I did have a few opportunities to go on the local Cod boats and hand line them but never got to as we were so busy for 2 1/2 weeks. I can fish everyday here at home so I compromised with my wife which was good. I still want to hit Newfie Land. Only changed flights in Gander once.  I don't want to get personal but what kind of ""fancy restraints"" are you talking about? I think that's for a different website."
962994,BITEME,2016-03-18 11:08:00,1968,Morning Cliff I have been to a lot of places in the world due to the nature of the job I was in. Nova Scotian in my heart but I'm still astounded by Newfoundland it is rugged rocky and beautiful and blows me away I think a motorhome would be the cats butt stay costal and do what you want everyday clams I think now you need a license to dig them mackeral can be caught almost everywhere when running it will be different all over there is big runs always as for cod look for locals that might want to make a few bucks or try on line and set it up to your traveling the locals are always accommodating and very friendly WATCH OUT FOR MOOSE IF DRIVING. your a lucky man enjoy your trip it is well worth the time and you may not want to come back  cheers peter

LOL, Sue and I did head out three years ago, got as far as PEI then a storm destroyed our boat house and we had to come home early. We did have a wonderful time, we visited countless light houses, just wandered the coast, stopped in little villages, went on one clam digging excursion, I even got to go fishing for 1/2 a day and caught cod and mackerel, It was our best vacation ever.  I looked at the tourisum website but I know that there are several members on here from NFLD that can help us narrow down our search and give us insight into places to stay, eat, hang out, and avoid the tourist traps.  Fancy restraunts to us: Anything I can't walk into wearing sandles and shorts and feel right at home."
963006,Sinker,2016-03-18 12:38:00,8692,"I will be there from last week of july til 2nd week of august. We will be up at the very Northern tip of the island at my dads place.....you met him at the marina once or twice.....come on by!  The cod fishery usually only runs those 3 weeks, so if thats what you want to do, be there then.  Honestly, if you want the real newfie experience stick to the small fishing villages and get to know a local. They will take good care of you, and knowing you, they would take you right in.  We have a pretty busy trip planned while we are there, but if you intended to go up the northern peninsula, call me on my cell and im sure we could get you out to jig a few cod, have a few drinks afterwards, and hang out for a good ole time.  I cant wait to go!  We are driving down. Leave july 19. I will be in a bit of a rush to get there though. Seen all the sights on the way enough times now that i just want to get ""home"".  If you have any questions just call or text me directly bud.  Just a warning. You may not want to leave once you get there! Lol  S."

963042,captpierre,2016-03-18 16:32:00,2521,Did the trip with the van and family 10 yrs ago. Took ferry to Port aux Basque. Gross  Morne (spelling) and  took the  Transcanada to St Johns Wanted to catch an Atlantic salmon in the rivers. Had to buy fly rod gear and hire a licensed guide. No luck. Lots of great scenery. Moose. Puffins. Icebergs. Gotta kiss the cod and get screeched in. Ferry was expensive. $700 there and back. Weather can suck even in summer. Gotta see it once Not sure I'd go back. Fairly depressed economy now with low oil.
963045,Sinker,2016-03-18 17:18:00,8692,My dad lives in a small town Called Griquet. Close to Lanse Aux Meadows. Also a very cool place to see.  He is about 20 mins drive from St. Anthony.  S.
963117,Big Cliff,2016-03-19 11:54:00,6899,"WOW, I can't beleive the prices of accomodations even in some of the ""out of the way"" places, motels and B&B's all seem to start at about $100.00 a night and go up from there. Even tried looking at some for the month of July and anything decent was around $3000.00 for the month.  Figured the cost just in gas for a motor home at about $1000.00 each way (more if towing a car) plus the cost of the ferry, camp grounds....... There has to be a better way!  We don't need much, clean, quiet, safe, effeciency suite would be nice.  We are thinking we'd like to move around a bit and get to see different places , maybe spend a week or two in different areas and I was thinking July and Aug. Who else has done this and what did you find!"
963123,John,2016-03-19 13:26:00,2956,Cliff accommodation will probably run $100 to $150 a night depending on what you choose... not sure 100% on Newfoundland prices but Barbara and I are paying average $140 a night for B&B in Nova Scotia and PEI in early Sept. Off season rates don't really start till October. We are still deciding whether to drive or fly. Flights and rental car are about the same as gas and additional nights accommodation to drive. I understand ferry cost is expensive so may be another reason to fly?
963128,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 15:46:00,8243,"Yes Cliff vacationing ain't cheap today. With just the cost of fuel it gets expensive fast. Years ago we would rent a motor home and the boys and I would go down to Myrtle beach for golf for 2 weeks. Some of the parks outside of town the hookup prices they wanted were ridiculous during peak times. And with 4 grown men in the RV it was getting too tight, real tight. A flight, rental and a huge condo and golf package was actually less per person and we kyboshed the RV thing. For me just lugging a towel and toiletries to the common shower was getting old fast and I was much younger and fit. RV traveling isn't any less money today than a traditional trip i.e. fly, rent a car and stay at B&B's that are well over 100 bucks per night comes out about even driving a RV or car to any tourist destination there and back. A friends Dad and Mom who are exactly your age bought a massive RV 10years back and would drive to Texas to winter every year towing a small car. 3 years ago he sold it as they found it too tough making the long drive. A return flight ( with some stops) is less expensive than the cost for them to drive down and back. That's what they do now. They bought a car and keep it at their trailer there."
963137,Sinker,2016-03-19 17:54:00,8692,Tourism is just about the only business left on the island and its not cheap. Its rediculous actually.  S.
963145,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 19:09:00,8243,"On that trip to the Rock were we didn't make it that far the places we stayed that were 100 bucks was cheap. They wanted close to $200.00 a night near Lunenburg. Heck we went to a wedding last fall in Hamilton and paid 120 bucks for a budget room on Centennial Parkway with tax. I had to find someone in the middle of the night to get more blankets as it was freezing in there. No luck thank goodness my wifes winter survival box in the car had a sleeping bag in it. 120 bucks and you need to bring your own blankets. Some budget, at least it came with a door and a lock.  I remember a lot of displaced Nova Scotian's and Newfs from work would take the ferry from Bar Harbor Maine to get there. Is it still done? I know it cuts off plenty of driving hours. The ferry can't be too cheap now though. I don't think, no I know I will never drive down east again. Pushing it for me would be a minimum of 3 nights each way now as my wife freaks driving on the highway for a long jaunt for some reason. That would get expensive getting a room for 6 nights plus fuel."
963146,manitoubass2,2016-03-19 19:17:00,11391,Never been there but sure would love too.  All the newfies I know come west for work.  Everyone of them is hilarious and fun to work with lol.  Some mighty fine scenery over there!  OI give me a call when your not servicing ticha?
963147,Big Cliff,2016-03-19 19:24:00,6899,"I guess I'm just surprised at the cost. Heck I hear fishermen are getting $5.00 a lb or less for lobster but it costs $3000.00 a month for a motel room. Oh well, it is what it is LOL. I'm going anyway!"
963149,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 19:42:00,8243,"Good for you Cliff, go. I haven't met anyone that came back to life yet once they left this Earth, not even Jesus as promised.  They don't live in motel rooms. They can hardly afford where they do live. Sad state the folks out east live in. Not fair at all. When a few guys that worked at Sydney Steel moved west to Hamilton they doubled their wages and benefits. Many worker here for 30 years sold their homes here and moved back the day after they retired. For what they got for a home here they could buy a mansion there and their pensions gave them a very good life. I actually thought hard when a had an opportunity to buy a place on Mahon Bay. Near where they film that show about the pirate treasure hunt on Oak Island. 10 acres. 400 feet of oceanfront, nice 3 bedroom house and huge barn/shop. $60000.00 in 2000. My brother in law said way too much money!!! We didn't because I realized they get 4 months of good weather, maybe. A 4 foot snow fall is nothing there. That same property 16 years latter is going for the same money. If it was around here with that much lakefront it would be well over 600K but it isn't."
963150,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 19:46:00,8243,"I'm servicing my wife 24 hours a day. What you are thinking of doesn't take but a few minutes, maybe."

Oh well, it is what it is LOL. I'm going anyway!   Like everywhere else, you need to do you homework and look around to find the  better bargains. for e.g. we stayed in a place with a kitchen and a separate bathroom in Twillingate for quite a good price a few years back."

963156,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-19 20:33:00,8243,"What are you talking about ""US old guys"" you have 9 years on me. The way things are going with my body this past winter I don't think I will nor will I want to see 70. No I want to see 90 like my Dad who will be 89 in a few weeks. He can out work me today I bet. It's not age but quality of life. My brother takes after Dad and I take after my 85 year old mother. Not fair. I got her Diabetes and 5 types of Arthritis and degenerative bone desease and he got her head of hair, thick as concrete and black as the Ace of Spades, not fair I say, not fair whatsoever."
963198,floater,2016-03-20 10:46:00,220,We drove through Labrador and took the ferry to the Northern tip of NF three years ago. We drove a truck with a pop up. NF was great. Stayed in some great camp grounds with full amenities that were empty. Fished for Sea Trout and did very well. The picturesque sea side towns were mostly gone! After that reno rebate they offered a few years ago we found lots of 'newly' sided homes near the water but they were all beige or white! Drove from L'anse Au Medow down to the southern tip. The best towns we found were east of Channel Port Aux-Basques on Hwy 470.

963210,Sinker,2016-03-20 13:55:00,8692,"I have always wanted to go that way, but heard the roads aren't great going through Labrador. It would cut a lot of the ferry cost for us, but I'm sure add a lot more driving?? My dad's place is about 10km from the ferry landing in Lanse Aux meadows.  For me, my gf and two kids it will cost almost $400 for the ferry. I count it as one night accomodation too.  We leave home and drive to Grand falls NB on the first day, about 10 hours, then next morning straight to the ferry....about 8 or so hours. Take the night ferry across and get a few Z's, and hit the island at first light for the trip up the coast to ""home"". Another 8 hour run. Its not really all that bad. Take a look at flights.....the prices are NUTS! To fly four of us down is over $3  Grand! The drive is part of the adventure IMO. I kinda like it. Its about 2500km one way. My vehicle gets about 11l/100km so I figure 300l of fuel at average a buck a litre. One night accommodations on the way down, plus food and etc.....lets say $1000 each way.....saves me a few bucks and my gf and kids get to see the east side of this country that they haven't seen before.....not too bad IMO.  Once we're there we just have the price of booze and gas for the boat LOL.....    S."
963240,jayess,2016-03-20 17:17:00,187,"My wife and I honeymooned in Newfoundland. Ten days, landed in St John, rented a car and drive the bonavista peninsula up to twilingate area, up to gros morne, and back.  We're very active, lots of hiking and talking to locals about the local hidden spots. Here's some of my thoughts based on what you've said:  - camping? The provincial parks are the cheapest at around $12./night and great accommodations (washrooms and showers) as most people are RVing. Private campgrounds are hit/miss in quality. The national park is expensive in comparison.  - in grand falls Windsor there's a great bed and breakfast called the carriage house. It's an excellent stop between at Johns and gros morne. - I hope you will consider some hiking. Nothing epic or crazy in elevation changes, but bare minimum I recommend getting out and walking the tablelands and the  brief walk to the Western Brook pond. Take the boat tour as you'll Anjou some of the Marine history and fishing studies in the pond.  -consider the skerwink trail on the bonavista peninsula. It's not grueling and gives some great coastal views without any crowds.  I can't comment on fishing or other types as we did things in the  You may be surprised how little advertising there is once there despite all of the tourism ads here. Aside from St John's, people generally aren't trying to sell you things... And it's great. I have to run for now, but one last thing -- book your Gros morne and St John's stays in advance.  Edit: apologies for tense and grammar errors. Typing on phone with baby in one hand!"
