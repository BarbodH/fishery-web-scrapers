I like to pull the secondary ribs or y bones o n walleye by slicing either side of the centre line st the tail end then pull the filet apart, belly side first then pull the centre line out. This will leave it in two halves and boneless and the nasty tasting centre line perfectly removed."

You know, I had been looking at sharpening methods for a while and it was suggested by most to get the best I could. I can't argue with what the experts say but I just could not see myself paying 3-4-$500 or more to sharpen knives for home use. I did some digging and found a video clip that caught my eye and watched it 2-3 times. Went ahead and ordered a stone from a reputable company in Japan and started ""practicing"" on a drawer of knives. Well it didn't take long, I'm impressed by how it all worked out and should have done this years ago. Check out the video. It's a little long winded but has good info. That little test he does at the end is impressive. Just remember, not all steel is equal in quality. Art knows about steel. Good luck. "

962658,aplumma,2016-03-15 16:53:00,6896,Just a note on steels they are not a sharpening tool. They are used to  take the burr off and stand the blade edge back up. The hardest part of sharpening a knife is keeping a consistent angle the finer the stone the longer it takes to remove metal so a coarse stone can do more damage to an angle than a finer stone in a short amount of time. If you want to see if you are holding an angle and sharpening to the edge of the blade (otherwise you are not sharpening you are just removing metal from the shoulder and changing the angle) you can scribe a mark with a sharpie and check to see how many passes it takes to remove it from the edge. I use an electron microscope when I am sharpening a blade for competitions on blade sharpening ( yes there are contests for something that stupid) and the final sharpening run at .05 micros leaves no tool marks and will cut you with no resistance it makes a razor blade seem dull when done. The edge on an average knife does not need this since it is such a fine edge it would roll cutting something as soft as cardboard. If you become prolific using conventional stones and want to take it to the next level then a set of water stones are a fine addition to blade care. They are very soft and make a sharpening slurry that will give you a great edge. I personally didn't like that style of sharpening and prefer to use diamond paste and balsa wood to cut my final edge however you need to have the knife stationary and move the balsa wood over it to keep from cutting into the wood.

963434,adolson,2016-03-22 02:11:00,783,"Good info in this thread.  I have a pair of the wooden-handled Rapalas, one is really short and new, which is my main blade for trout nowadays. I don't fillet them, though, I just slice the belly, cut the heads off, pull the guts out, and clean the mudvein or whatever you call it. The longer one is a lot older, but same basic knife, and I'll use that for any filleting I do.  I already picked out my next one, which will be a folding Uncle Henry / Schrade / Taylor.  However, I'd like to get try my hand at making my own knives as yet another hobby. I don't see myself doing a fillet knife right off the bat, though. I think I'd enjoy the process, but we'll see.

Also when the blade is opened it locks in place for extra safety.

962324,aplumma,2016-03-13 18:32:00,6896,The knife has a tip that is used to slice with. The backside of the edge is for scaling fish or can be sharpened to be used to slice the belly. You has less chance of poking your hand on a pass thru fillet. I personally prefer the wider fillet knife it is a little more ridged and is easier to hold flat while cutting the skin off.   Art

So looking for recommandations willing to pay much more for quality
962187,Consigliere,2016-03-12 20:36:00,121,Depends how much you filet. I like electric for taking the filets of the fish and taking out y bones or ribs and taking the skin off. Do that on the boat so can get rid of the carcass in the water. Take them home and clean up the filets with a cutco knife to remove the brownish fat layer and any blood lines etc. I also keep all back bones for making stock and sometimes the heads as well. The electric is perfect for that. Recommend a glove with the electric. It can go through flesh pretty quick. That's my system. Me and a buddy go through a lot of pike and walleye that way. Using a rapala 12v for last 3 years without an issue  As for quality filet knives one thing is to use a hone. Often blades don't need sharpening just the blade needs to be straightened back a bit.

962202,aplumma,2016-03-12 21:38:00,6896,I have been making knife for years and the 440c is the main stay of the fillet knifes. The hardness can be between 54 and 59 depending on the annealing process. The cyro process yields the hardest measurements. A properly sharpened knife at 20 degrees will hold an edge that have lasted a few guides 2 or 3 months with proper touch ups. As you get into harder SS metals your flexibility suffers and while the blades are harder this is a two edged sword. The knife will hold an edge slightly longer but is more difficult to resharpen. The curse of knifes is the sharper the edge the easier it is to roll the edge which feels dull. Most knifes need a few swipes with a ceramic rod to straighten out the edge which can be done 3 or 5 times before a regrind is needed. I grind all of my knifes up to 1000 grit then polish the edge using diamond paste finishing off with .05 microns which is a mirror finish on the edge. The knifes at this level cut amazingly but a few contact cuts with the cutting board will roll the edge and need to be ceramic rod.  Before I paid for a high end knifeThe best thing to do is to practice sharpening knifes until you can make a consistent sharp edge otherwise you will have an expensive dull knife that you will be disappointed with.

I suggest you just educate yourself on the various types of materials used and the measurements for quality - such as hardness, toughness and corrosion resistance.   That will help out a lot in deciding whether a knife is of good quality or not.   This site has some really good info and tables showing the qualities of various types of steel.   Cutco is very popular, but if you do some research you'll find that a lot of people consider them inferior for the price they charge.  Dexter makes some less expensive knives that also seem popular.   I think the Dexters are popular because they are cheap and highly functional knives (sharp and easy to sharpen).    So, they are widely used commercially.   Mora (Sandvik 12C27 or 14C28N steel) is an inexpensive alternative.  Grohmann looks good too as does Knives of Alaska and North Arm.    The North Arm knife actually looks like a great choice (it's made with CPM S35VN steel, which is primo stuff).  Found another decent knife made with CPM S35SVN steel, the Bark River Kalahari Sportsman.  You can also get a model made with Bohler N661 steel, which they claim is better but I can't get much information about it.  Cabela's also makes two really nice fillets knives.   The Cabela's Alaskan Guide (CPM S30V steel) and the Cabela's Silver Stag D-2 Fillet Elk Stick Knife (D-2 steel).  Those are both good quality knives.  There are a lot of great custom solutions as well.    You can find some excellent knife makers all over Canada and the USA.  Beebe Knives Custom Cutlery Dozier Knives"

962206,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-12 21:52:00,8243,"n my experience as Art stated basically is that a grinding wheel or sharpening stone in the wrong hands will ruin the most expensive knives in the world. The harder the steel the less flexible the knife, the softer the steel the blade dulls faster. I use a stiffer boning knife to get the fillets off the bone or cut through bone to make Salmon steaks for example. Then a longer flexible knife to fillet the meat from the skin or rib cage. For perch I pay the owner of where my boat is moored to do them in the 100 year old potato peeler and she then debones them. 3 bucks a pound net weight. A 2 man limit of perch would take us hours I would bet.  I would never order a knife if I couldn't see how it feels in my hand. For a knife one size don't fit all just like shoes."

962237,FloatnFly,2016-03-13 01:08:00,1640,"like aplumma said, learning how to properly sharpen and hone your knife is key.  once you learn that, your knife will be golden.  I would suggest practicing on an old knife first, as misgrinding or honing will either roll your edge, of put a nice big burr on it, you'll be able to feel it just running your thumb nail down the side of the blade  out of everyone on this board, i would guess that I put my knives through the worst punishment.  regrinding a new edge every 3-5 weeks is common with our knives.  average life span of about 8months to a year for a knife at the shop"
