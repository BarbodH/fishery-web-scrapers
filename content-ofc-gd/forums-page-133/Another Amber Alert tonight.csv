963328,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-21 02:34:00,8243,At 9:36 PM. Bell TV took you to channel 1911 automatically. From TO Police services. I hope it all worked out as there was no further alert after the 1st one. Turned on the TV in the bedroom a few hrs latter and it was on ch. 1911.  Did you get it too?

963337,FloatnFly,2016-03-21 03:14:00,1640,"on rogers, we got an alert covering the bottom 3rd of the screen"

963348,Terry,2016-03-21 12:38:00,14456,Bell takes you to another channel if you are on an American channel and does a banner if you are on a Canadian channel The main problem is it takes over your unit ignores your parental locks and switches your unit to all channels guide  so now children can see and access all channels I like the banners but don't like anyone screwing with my dish settings
