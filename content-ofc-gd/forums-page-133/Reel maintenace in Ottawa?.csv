963190,chong,2016-03-20 02:54:00,102,Is there a place that cleans shimano reels in Ottawa?
963202,Lape0019,2016-03-20 12:49:00,647,I used to bring my Shimano reels to Paddletales tackle and he would send them out to Shimano. It started costing me too much because of the amount if reels I had so I send one in here and there and just clean them myself now.
963231,wallyboss,2016-03-20 16:58:00,1095,"Google it,  Shimano reels are one of the easiest to clean. Tons of video online that show you every steps. Here is an example made of one by a Shimano tech.  "
963322,chong,2016-03-21 01:28:00,102,"thanks for the video, it just that I don't want to take a chance with the stella."
963351,Lape0019,2016-03-21 12:51:00,647,"LOL,  I wouldn't either. Bring it to paddletales or call Shimano in Peterborough and see what their instructions for sending it in would be. Turn around time should not be very long since it is in their top tier of reels."
963355,wallyboss,2016-03-21 13:14:00,1095,I see that your location says Montreal ??  have you tried here? 
963361,Lape0019,2016-03-21 13:58:00,647,"That is where Paddletales used to send all of the reels that came in for servicing. Now, He sends Shimano back to them for servicing. Any other product, I am not certain of. It is either a guy in Orillia or still Shiman Au Peche."
963371,musky_hunter,2016-03-21 15:03:00,328,"With a Stella please send it back direct to Shimano, they are the only ones with the proper jig to do it properlly and they replace the seals and any parts if needed. Also, the platinum service the reel gets back to you in 2-3 days.  I send all my spinning reels back to Chris even if i service my own baitcasters."
963372,Lape0019,2016-03-21 15:05:00,647,"Thanks CNDBasshunter,  I couldn't remember what the platinum service was called.  And like you, I will open a baitcaster without even thinking of it. I won't touch a spinning reel. I'm sure I could figure it out, I just choose not to."
963380,NANUK,2016-03-21 17:09:00,797,"A Stella is absolutely worth sending to Shimano in Peterborough, they do an amazing job of servicing and have access to all the parts needed."
963429,chong,2016-03-22 01:48:00,102,"I know shiman au peche, brought my reels there before didn't like the service. Do you have the number for Shimano Peterborough ?"
