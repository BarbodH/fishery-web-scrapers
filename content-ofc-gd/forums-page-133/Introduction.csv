963798,dr_zayas,2016-03-24 17:47:00,10,"Hello,  Just found this forum and have really been enjoying some of the threads so I just wanted to introduce myself now that I have joined.  I really enjoy fishing for Smallmouth, Walleye and Pike in Ontario. My favourite fishing may be for Lake Trout though as I have been fortunate enough to land some monsters up on Great Bear Lake. I have recently gained access to a family cottage on Lake of Bays and hope to fish the north end of the lake for years to come. I have already had a lot of success with some 2-3lb Smallies off the dock and some 3-5lb Lakers through the ice!  Looking to explore the surrounding areas and maybe find some Brookies if possible!

Been here for (well I can't even remember but 16+ years) and you won't find a better bunch of guys and gals (don't mess with the gals, I got dibs on the hugs). So tell us a little more about you; where do you call home, what sort of work do you do, do you like to cook LOL?"
963805,dr_zayas,2016-03-24 18:30:00,10,"Thanks for the warm welcome Big Cliff!  I am 32 and I live in Toronto on the east side of High Park, although I hope to spend a lot of time on Lake of Bays! I invest pension money for the Canada Pension Plan and I really enjoy frying Bass and Lake Trout! When I'm not fishing I also enjoy golf and hockey. I hope to contribute to the fishing and condition reports around here frequently.  Maybe some pics would tell a more interesting story.... https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4088FC4D6E65BB92!1827&authkey=!AJPkqmQMqbOIB8Y&ithint=folder%2c"
