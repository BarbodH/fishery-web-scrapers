963913,FloatnFly,2016-03-25 15:27:00,1640,"its pretty simple to use, basically just sliders to play with the different elements. and a ton of different filters you can layer on top of each other."
963916,muddler,2016-03-25 15:51:00,623,Thanks for the heads up. I always wanted to use it.  muddler
963919,SirCranksalot,2016-03-25 16:15:00,3291,"This software will take some time to learn as its listed as a professional grade editor.  On a scale of 1-10 where Photoshop is a 10, how would you rate it re difficulty for learning?"
963923,FloatnFly,2016-03-25 16:35:00,1640,"well, considering i've never used photoshop and i've only been using this program for a couple of hours now.  using the program is fairly simple, learning the details of getting professional grade editing is hard.  just play with the filters and sliders until you find something you like.  theres no cut and pasting photos together, you have a picture you play with the colours and light balances to get something you like"
963941,SirCranksalot,2016-03-25 18:49:00,3291,Sorry---I always assume that others are far ahead of me on a lot of the photo editing and other computer stuff! But thx for that. I shall give it a whirl.
963946,kickingfrog,2016-03-25 20:41:00,8333,Thanks. I've never used anything but the standard photo editing tools. Time to play around.
963963,FloatnFly,2016-03-25 23:24:00,1640,"Thanks. I've never used anything but the standard photo editing tools. Time to play around.  I was the same way, saw this and gave it a try.  big difference especially if you use the HDR efex program"
963972,Raf,2016-03-26 01:04:00,3495,i played around with it a bit today.  the detail extractor and tonal contrast tools are pretty neat.  i could see a lot of these effects way over used though kinda like HDR when it first hit.
963982,Dave Bailey,2016-03-26 03:18:00,1641,"Is it an HDR program, or does it use one photo at a time?"
963999,FloatnFly,2016-03-26 11:30:00,1640,"one photo at a time, you have to do all the adjustments, its 7 programs in one, each one has a different set of filters to play with.  if you click on the link it will give you an overview of the different programs in the package"
