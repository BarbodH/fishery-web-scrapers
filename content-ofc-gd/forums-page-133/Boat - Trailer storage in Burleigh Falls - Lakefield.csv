963752,Another Canadian,2016-03-24 13:40:00,41,"Hi Everyone,  We recently purchased a cottage on a Stony Lake island, and our parking rights do not allow storage of boat trailers as they would rather use the avaialble space for vehicles. ( I do agree with this.)  I am looking to find storage for a boat trailer in the spring/summer/fall and winter storage come the fall when we close up the cottage in the Burleigh Falls and Lakefield areas.  I have searched the usual subjects on line and have sent some inquiring emails but have not heard back yet  (Trailer parks, marinas, storage units).  Was hoping someone here might be able to recommend a farmer or land owner that has space inside or outside for storage.  Thanks, Bill"
