512310,smally21,2010-10-16 17:12:00,993,pretty cool. even on a computer screen makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. i was in northern england climbing what they call mountains and 2 harrier jets ripped thru the valley a couple of hundred feet below us. almost blew us off the rock when they passed us!

512416,shane,2010-10-17 01:10:00,652,I wish that commercial passenger jets would fly that low.  It would sure make the flight a lot more fun.

512440,kickingfrog,2010-10-17 02:43:00,8333,Your camera better be ready the first time.  I'd love a chance to do that... my camera bag does have room for a spare pair of shorts.
512726,blaque,2010-10-18 12:55:00,2419,"NUTS.  I was fishing a small inland lake in western new york about 7 years ago (chautaqua lake) and was out on the water one morning when a Military jet (F-14/15 no idea lol) came down just above the lake and banked hard. At first i was like WOW that was awesome.........and after thinking about if for a bit it kinda ticked me off lol.  Not only did he probably shut the fishing off for the entire day, but his look at me stunt could have gone really wrong.  I just found it really peculiar"
