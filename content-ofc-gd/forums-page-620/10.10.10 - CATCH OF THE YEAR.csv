Baby Leah is the newest generation for both sides of our families.     BTW, Granpa Steve & I were fishing that weekend and he landed this beauty. Guess what?? 7 lb. 13 oz on the digital scale.    As soon as Baby Leah fits into a life jacket, she will be on the water with her proud parents/grandparents. Cheers, Symon"
