512694,TDunn,2010-10-18 04:10:00,680,"I had the opportunity to put in some hours on the riverbanks north and in the rapids on the St. Marys. We were hammered with over a 100mm of rain about 2 weeks ago and I was glued to the flow chart combined with a few trips north just scouting.  Once the day came for my first actual fishing trip the water was still very high with some colour. Decided against the float and pulled out the St Croix to bounce some spots that have been known to produce when the water levels are up. In about 45 mins, I had landed 1 coho and had another fish take me down river out of sight (bow). I also realized I forgot my camera battery at home in the charger....Brutal....  I figured I would stick with bouncing roe but with no success in 30-40 mins, I decided to try a fresh worm. First bounce, fish on. During the next 2 hours I landed 1 nice bow and 2 decent cohos with another 3 fish taking me downriver all on worms. I actually fought one for 10 minutes and honestly thought I had won the battle before it decided to use the high and fast water to run completely out of sight. I returned to Superior’s tribs two days later and was greeted with prime conditions for floating. Bouncing gear out, float gear in. Experienced some exciting action both days catching coho’s for the most part with a hot steelhead mixed in every once in awhile.  Typical coho      A bunch of these guys were munching out        A friend/co-worker tagged along one morning. He landed and released his first fall steelhead. Even the power in this smaller fish freaked him right out.    I landed a nice chromer myself.....too bad the pic was taken on night mode...      A bear snuck up on me one evening and gave me half a heart attack when I turned around. He didn't even know I was there and was basically just fooling around/playing with sticks. I shot a quick video of him from my spot in the river but its right at dark so its tough to make out... Bear  Once the levels dropped, I moved shop downtown to the rapids. This place is freaking loaded with fish this time of year. Fly, float, bounce, or casting hardware will all take fish. I have been mainly casting hardware with some bouncing here and there.  The pinks have calmed down. I only caught 1 pink in my last  3 outings.  The kings are not far behind. Although a bunch of the fish I caught still had not spawned, most have. With this weather coming this week, I would expect the majority of Chinooks to be done spawning anytime.  Most Kings are looking like this....Not very appealing but still put up a serious fight.    The coho are still in good shape with silver bullets still around.           I took a buddy down one morning for a couple hours. He quickly landed his first cohos ever. Also his first St Marys rapids fish.    He also landed this... Pinook?    I Purchased some gear this weekend at bass pro and natural sports(kitchener).  Didn't buy much but I picked up some steelhead gear that I needed. After a few days off its back on the water in the am. Finishing my beer, adding the new steelhead gear into the arsenal and then to bed.  Thanks for reading and more to come in the next few weeks...  TDunn"
512695,BillM,2010-10-18 04:49:00,17367,Nice report man!  Live worms work wonders when the water is still on the warm side
512704,solopaddler,2010-10-18 10:55:00,8605,"Nice job Tyler. Gonna have to fish the rapids sometime this fall, great stuff."
512724,Rod Caster,2010-10-18 12:50:00,5784,Good report. Sounds like your river is producing very well this year!
512777,perchslayer666,2010-10-18 16:56:00,280,"Awesome, I guess the Atlantics are done? Love the big river 'pinning reports"
512782,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 17:06:00,2690,"Beauty Tyler!!!  You guys are really ""nudging"" me towards my steelhead gear!!"
512790,Kinger,2010-10-18 17:40:00,351,"Thanks for the report man. Some beauty cohos and steel.  Thats a pretty nice Pinook. I need to get a coho to complete my grand slam this season (king,pink,coho,atlantic). Gotta love the St Marys."
512813,johnnyb,2010-10-18 18:56:00,3413,Great report....seems like the St. Mary's is the kind of place even *I* could catch some river steel
512819,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-18 19:11:00,3761,"Great collection of catches and photos TDunn. Is it me or has the ""river fishing"" type reports been on a diet this fall. Haven't seen as many as last year...O well  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
512913,TDunn,2010-10-19 00:25:00,680, Shoot me a PM when you do
512914,laszlo,2010-10-19 00:29:00,487,Well done Tyler. Wish I could have made it up there this fall.
513140,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-19 21:42:00,0,sweet buddy... that rain we had was an early tease for steelies!  managed a few real nice fish in the days after the rain.  unfortunately since then fish have been few and far between with A LOT of anglers...lots of coho to be had but they aren't really my passion.  looking forward to the colder weather for more fish/less anglers.  anytime you need a partner on the tribs let me know.
513186,TDunn,2010-10-19 23:52:00,680, Ya I guess its about time we hook up. Shoot me a PM this fall and we'll get out.
513366,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-20 16:36:00,655,"Sweet fish. Always wanted to fish that river. So many tribs, too little time lol."
513368,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-20 16:53:00,1107,Nice report man !!! Wish it wasn't so far away I love catching steel on the pin in big water.
