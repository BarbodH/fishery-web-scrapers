513416,Kwan,2010-10-20 19:47:00,132,"Hahaha now I know-  To land a big fishwith light line, keep the motor on and drive in circles."
513467,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-20 23:09:00,0,Sounds like good times among OFC'ers and a bonus Ski!
513511,vinnimon,2010-10-21 00:20:00,2593," His musky tactics are wrong cause hes sucking on the Bong Smile, point, laugh as you will Hes just a poor pontoon muskie dude  Its a fifty, its a fifty, his darlins so proud to us he was  load and so rude   Continue on if you like guys and gals Ill see if another ofner can shine some tunes on this one"
513525,Dave Jones,2010-10-21 01:41:00,50,   Pontoon dude was in a pretty heated argument with the M.N.R guy.It looked like he was going to take his rods away for a minute
512867,vinnimon,2010-10-18 22:42:00,2593,"First off a very special thanks to Slowpoke! Thank you kindly Brian! I took slowpokes offer and after a few pms, it was on!I met up with Frank, then off to Brians place!After a little intro and chat we were off to LSC! We arrived at LSC just after sun up!What a view! We began trolling for about an hour or so, seen a few skis rise in the meantime! Finally we had one on,then lost after a few seconds!We continued on and after a while finally another one on! This one is going to be landed! And she sure was landed! A 39 incher! The funniest moments of the day was the pontoon dude and the wheel! But thats for another day!"
512871,splashhopper,2010-10-18 22:52:00,2931,where is   the fish ?
512872,vinnimon,2010-10-18 22:53:00,2593,"A few more pics for yas! Thanks again guys, I had a blast!"
512875,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 23:00:00,2690,"I sent the other pics to Vince via e-mail, but, he didn't include them, so....for your viewing pleasure  Brian AKA Slowpoke biting one of our lures of choice    The battle begins    In the net!!    Vinnie's 39"" early birthday present    Me, chilling...    Vince biting ""dog balls""  the actual name of the colour pattern/lure, LOL!!     Thanks, again, to Slowpoke for a great day out on the water!!  Can't wait to do it again!"
512878,Roy,2010-10-18 23:10:00,13728,"Good stuff, guys...glad you had a good time but with Brian it's a done deal."
512879,spincast,2010-10-18 23:11:00,3279,Nice going guys   -- maybe next time
512883,Handlebarz,2010-10-18 23:19:00,3790,nice pics guys glad ya had some fun them woodies catch a lot of fish and Dogs Balls is a hot fall color here I thought you guys were sticking around for dinner maybe next time.
512894,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 23:38:00,2690,"To elaborate on Vince's comment about pontoon dude---  He actually had the first fish landed for the day.  Picture a guy, by himself, trolling in a pontoon boat for musky.  He hooks one, and, proceeds to play it for at least ten (probably closer to fifteen) minutes...all the while, circling the river with his engine running!!!  Finally, Slowpoke had to speak up and say, ""why don't you turn your engine off?""  Pontoon man's response...""I know what I am doing!""  He then shot that statement right out of the water by saying ""I use light line, that's why I catch them!""    DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!   First of all who uses light line for musky...second of all...HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE COLOUR OF THE WATER...was my thought!  We were using baits bigger than a small walleye, and, you could only see them for about a foot under the surface!!! Hopefully his ""fifty incher"" survived to fight another day!"
512900,Terry,2010-10-18 23:47:00,14456,looks like a good day on the water....
512982,Whopper,2010-10-19 11:29:00,2174,Pontoon guy brought help on Sunday  I was nice to meet you guys
513002,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-19 13:25:00,2690," Nice meeting you, as well!!  Pontoon guy/man/dude, they could write a country song about him,"
513051,SlowPoke,2010-10-19 16:38:00,2984," Someone to direct traffic while he drags 'ole nessie around the river before netting it? LOL I'll be sure to have my 8 lb main line and 4 lb fluoro leaders ready to go for next time. Those creatures are so fussy. Good times, we'll do it again."
513077,Whopper,2010-10-19 18:05:00,2174,
513088,Joey,2010-10-19 19:12:00,9122,Great report guys.  They always seem to hit when you just light up a smoke don't they  Joey
513143,SlowPoke,2010-10-19 21:56:00,2984,I tested that theory about 20 times
513147,landry,2010-10-19 22:04:00,1005,"I was there - pontoon man is there often and he is quite the character. Often runs 2 lines per person in areas where only one is allowed. I saw someone doing repeated circles around a fish too - it was  hilarious. My buddy yelled ""doesn't your boat have that optional 'neutral feature' on it??? He just looked at us. We howled!"
513169,splashhopper,2010-10-19 23:10:00,2931,looks like a fun day ... wtg
513185,vinnimon,2010-10-19 23:51:00,2593,"Nice to see you out there as well Whopper!

Frank, thanks for coming along! Brian, thanks for inviting us! It was an OFC day to a tee for me, with the gtg in the hammer afterwards I couldnt ask for anything more! Next time Im bringing my daughters Barbie Doll rod, I'll show off that pontoon boat dude!"

513318,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-20 12:17:00,2690," Yupper!!!!  Pontoon Man, Pontoon Man...he'll catch muskies when nobody can His line is light, his fights are long His musky tactics are all wrong.  Working on that country song"

513388,SlowPoke,2010-10-20 18:11:00,2984,What are you complaining about? That still leaves you with 116 hours to fish!!!
513389,SlowPoke,2010-10-20 18:15:00,2984," Woodies, Jakes and HandleBarz is all I ever run anymore. I should sell the rest and take an early retirement!"
