512456,OhioFisherman,2010-10-17 03:26:00,6623,"When fishing them under a bobber or slip bobber, perch rig, spreader always hooked under the dorsal fin.  Casting, trolling, on a jig head? through the lips."
512461,Fishnwire,2010-10-17 06:36:00,983,  Bang on.
512478,fish_fishburn,2010-10-17 12:50:00,1311,"If I'm using live minnows on a jig for walleye, I put the hook point throuhg the mouth and out the gill slit. Slide the minnow up the shaft of the hook and put the point through the back at the dorsal fin. This helps keep your bait on better for them light biters that are just grabbing your bait by the tail."

512535,Muskieman,2010-10-17 18:48:00,2472,  Yep.  Also helps to prevent line twist and minnow theft.

512577,OhioFisherman,2010-10-17 22:02:00,6623,"Aberdeen hooks are for panfish, even the bigger ones 4/0 or so, try to hook a minnow under the dorsal fin so it grabs meat but doesn`t contact their back bone, they will live a lot longer on the hook."

512688,Kwan,2010-10-18 03:26:00,132," I bet the blind perch does work better LOL.  That is so mean to the baitfish, though."
512689,Kwan,2010-10-18 03:27:00,132,sorry i meant blind minnow haha! no i'm not using my perch for bait LOL
512773,wallyboss,2010-10-18 16:44:00,1095,"on a jig thru the eyes.  For under a tipup or tipdown. I put it on the side, ahead of the Dorsal fin just under the skin with the hookpoint coming out just behind the gills, on a circle hook and they hook themselves."
