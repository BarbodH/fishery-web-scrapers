Attached is a typical smallie; sorry about the quality but it's the old phone while by yourself trick."
512846,I'mHooked,2010-10-18 20:36:00,525,Nice Smallie.  Any leaves on the trees our are they close to bare yet?

512964,chris.brock,2010-10-19 08:36:00,4053,"was up there on the weekend too, the leaves are pretty well gone"
512968,singingdog,2010-10-19 09:49:00,1047,Leaves are mostly gone up here....just the oaks hanging on now. Water temps are generaly mid 50s.
