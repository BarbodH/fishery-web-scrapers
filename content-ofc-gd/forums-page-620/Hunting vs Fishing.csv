513287,John Bacon,2010-10-20 03:44:00,3277,"Or, for us those of still on the low side of 65... why is fishing not like hunting where seniors pay there share as well?  Is the glass half empty or half full?"
513307,Billy Bob,2010-10-20 11:01:00,5865, Congratulation on your healthy 65 years and enjoy your free fishing seasons ahead of you....you could transfer over to NYS at 70 and get a hunting/fishing license here for free or it may be $5 now....my father always talked about getting his free license at 65 and then the year of they raised the age limit to 70...

513356,misfish,2010-10-20 15:44:00,29133,"  Good call.  My first reply,I misread your question."
513387,Billy Bob,2010-10-20 18:05:00,5865," You don't need tags for small game hunting  And the Canadian Government could charge you a loonie for your tags....here in NYS my son get a FREE hunting/fishing/bow hunting, etc....because he's in the Air Force."
