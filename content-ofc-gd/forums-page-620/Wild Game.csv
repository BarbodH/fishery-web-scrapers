513084,Gregoire,2010-10-19 18:40:00,1397,"If You're close to downtown Toronto the St. Lawrence market has a few butcher shops that have a variety of wild game. White House meats in particular carries all the types of meat that you mentioned. However, it is not a cost effective choice, so prepared to spend considerably more than you might find in other locations."
513292,Stern Rules,2010-10-20 05:50:00,342,"Definately Black Angus. I've been there and Lake Land Meats too. From Black Angus I've gotten elk, bison, boar, kangaroo, ostrich, rattlesnake, alligator and camel. Haven't gotten to the rattler yet but the rest were good. The 'roo burgers are great and camel aren't bad either. I paid $46.99 for that rattler and the gator was around $16 /lb. Definately worth a try. There's a Black Angus in Thornbury and Mississauga."
513299,misfish,2010-10-20 10:10:00,29133," Thanks for the heads up.  Ostrich I have had in a chille.Awesome.   Did you say CAMEL Whats that like?. I,ll try anything once,or twice."
