This is Earl letting out the Gill net to catch some bait ... the local mudshad proved to be elusive and after 3 net drops and 4 baitfish we decided to see if it was enough to fish with.    This is a view down river from bouy 55 where the blues hang out usually    A short wait and rod # 4 goes down   The results 14 lb Blue Catfish   Ready set fish   next fish coming on board   A 14 lber on deck   A 22lb shotgun is up in arms   The final fish on board before we ran out of bait 34 lb   All in all a great day on the water and with the boat repair proven to be correct a happy crew headed in to clean off the slime and put the boat to bed till the next trip.
