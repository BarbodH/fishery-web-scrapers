512965,pikehunter,2010-10-19 08:43:00,1659,"Had trouble with mine from the beginning (2005) took it back to the dealer for repair at his cost, didn't cure the problem. Then came across a set of LED's on sale dirt cheap at a Walmart clearance sale, hooked them up and have never had an issue yet. Go for it."
513109,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-19 19:48:00,2690, Strong statement...perhaps an alternative? I sense a bad experience with PA.
513111,irishfield,2010-10-19 19:49:00,26272,Don't worry Frank.. they sell the best tape on the market (sold as TARP tape)to fix any junk they may sell.
513125,Fisherman,2010-10-19 20:44:00,7201,"The one forgiving thing about P/A is their return policy, you're not satisfied, bring it back, you break it during resonable use,  bring it back.  At least there you don't have to argue with them like those turnips at China Tire."
513198,vinnimon,2010-10-20 00:08:00,2593,"P/a does have a good return policy! Their grote lights are fine! Look for the marine lights, if its a knock off, dont bother! The Led lights I pointed out on Brians trailer are the ones to get as a marker light.But your paying a little more!  "
513223,Whopper,2010-10-20 00:56:00,2174,"I bought a set four years ago (not PA's), I was a little reluctant because they had just come out, well I haven't had one bit of trouble since. Last weekend some guy freak out at the ramp and started yelling at me "" Your lights are on"" I said so, it ain't going to hurt those LED lights and he just looked at me funny Now I don't make a habit out of keeping them plugged in while backing in the water, but if they were still incandescent I would have blown a bulb or two"
513225,irishfield,2010-10-20 00:58:00,26272,"I never unplug my, LED, trailer lights Phil ! If I did.. .my reverse lock out solenoid wouldn't work and my trailer brakes would come on!"
513235,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-20 01:15:00,2690,"Well I messed around a bit more tonight, and, still no luck getting the darn things working.  Keep running out of daylight too...guess I should buy a decent worklamp while I'm at it The entire right side of the trailer is messed now...no lights at all.  The left lights up, but, no signal.  ARRRGHHHHHHHH!!! The re-wire is looking more attractive all the time!"
513241,Whopper,2010-10-20 01:20:00,2174," Good point Wayne but..... I don't have trailer brakes I kind of wish I did though, my 17.5 footer is a heavy boat for it's size"
513260,Rattletrap2,2010-10-20 02:08:00,1652,"Good point about the slush build-up Roy. I don't tow much in the winter, so never had that problem, but something else to think about! I have the PA LED lights on my utility trailer an am very pleased with both their performance and their brightness. They do sell some junk, but they also have some decent stuff and these lights seem to fit into the latter group.  As far as trailers over 80"" wide goes, the only thing that is required is the three identification lights mounted in the centre of the trailer at the rear. I bought these separately (also LED versions) when they go on sale. Both my boat trailer and utility trailer are over 80"".  I bought a set of LED lights for the boat trailer as well, but have not got around to changing them out yet. These are from the US equivalent of PA called Harbor Freight. There is a store in the same plaza as Gander Mountain in Port Huron, Michigan.  I have side marker LED lights from PA to install as well. Good stuff!"
513305,Billy Bob,2010-10-20 10:54:00,5865," My 1985 trailer came with the three identification lights mounted in the center of the trailer but I kept breaking them because they hung so far down......I removed them about 20 years ago even though my trailer is more then 80"" wide.....never been stopped over that...as a matter of fact I stopped having the trailer inspected over 20 years ago....waste of money as I can inspect it myself....  Both (left/right) your directionals run can be checked real quick by putting on the 4 way hazards or just lock/unlock the tow vehicle with the remote as you stand back at the end of the trailer. If the lights blink on the tow vehicle they should also at the trailer.  For those who have trouble with their lights, they need to get a test light, something similar to this but they should cost under $5 US...  http://www.ipdusa.com/Volvo-140/Tools/12-Volt-Test-Light/p-78-725-2408/  This way you can figure out where power is good, up to that point and then keep working back towards the trailer lights.....doesn't do any good to put on new lights and wiring if the problem is at the tow vehicle. This quick check only takes minutes to diagnose where the short is.  Happy Wiring......  Bob"
513308,Roy,2010-10-20 11:13:00,13728,"Thanks, good info Billy Bob. I still have the original three markers at the back...still working well but I'll be going to LED when I get the chance."
512753,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 15:11:00,2690,"My trailer lights have been driving me nuts this year.  Always seems to be a problem with one or the other...left acts as a hazard...then doesn't work.  Right is fine, then it pooches.  Darn thing is less than two years old, and, yes I ALWAYS unplug before launching. Anyways, I'm pretty darn close to re-wiring the whole thing with some new LED's, and, Princess Auto has a kit on sale for $50.  Anybody out there purchased it?  Thanks"
512754,BFSC Kevin,2010-10-18 15:15:00,1351,"""For boat, snowmobile, camper or utility trailers under 80"" wide"" How wide is your trailer?"
512760,Roy,2010-10-18 15:46:00,13728,I'm going to be changing mine over to LED also but a word of caution. They're not very safe for winter driving as they don't heat up and the slush and snow covers them up and no one can see you.
512761,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 15:47:00,2690,"Don't have the exact width, here with me, but, I'm pretty sure she is less.  My boat is a 14 ft Legend Prosport."
512765,misfish,2010-10-18 15:54:00,29133, Very good point Roy.Was going to mention that aswell.
512767,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 16:03:00,2690,"  Thanks, guys!  Not too worried about this fact since I put the boat away before the winter crap hits. But, definitely, a great point Roy!!!!!"
512768,Tom McCutcheon,2010-10-18 16:07:00,627,Now that is something that never entered my thought process. Very good information Roy Thanks.
512771,wallyboss,2010-10-18 16:37:00,1095,It sounds like your trailer lights issue is a bad ground. When they act up and it doesn't make any sense.
512772,walleyemen,2010-10-18 16:39:00,316,"i had problems with my boats lights as well, removed them and replaced with the l.e.ds from princess, have been trouble free ever since, great for boat trailers, brighter, less voltage to run them, and most guys are not towing boats threwout the winter, but a very good point by Roy none the less.Lso the l.e.ds are water tight, in 3 years i have never had to unplug them when launching!"
512774,ADB,2010-10-18 16:49:00,444, I'm having the same problems.  What does the kit normally cost?
512779,Raf,2010-10-18 17:00:00,3495,i put these led lights from PA on my trailer this year.  too early to tell long term durability but so far so good.
512780,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 17:02:00,2690, Think regular price is about $75.
512783,Roy,2010-10-18 17:13:00,13728,In my area it'd be more like $100. I guess it depends on whether you're getting the plate light and how many marker lights you have.
512848,scugpg,2010-10-18 20:40:00,1373,I have the LED lights from PA and so far so good. Really bright!
512854,Billy Bob,2010-10-18 21:17:00,5865,"If you're in no hurry, check Ebay for this kind of stuff.  Bob"
512865,wkrp,2010-10-18 22:29:00,656,"If you are going through the trouble of rewiring your trailer with the LED lights throw away the wire that is included in the kit and buy some good quality wire for the job . Usually its wire quality that causes issues with trailer wiring. As far as led lights go, they are great."
512877,spincast,2010-10-18 23:09:00,3279,You know my vote Frank - yank the incadscents. The LED's put my  fuse blowing issue to rest once and for all - Got to say though - good thing I'm a fair weather boater too - never thougth about the slush melt. Oh - and the set up will fit yours  - mine was for 80 in wide limit too.
512882,IndySKS,2010-10-18 23:16:00,134,"I bought my LED's earlier this year at Gander Mountain in MI. they were about $54 regular price, i hit it on a day when it was 80% off...sweet deal. Too early to tell long term but so far they have been great. I was also having issues with the old bulb ones when they go wet. I put them on my utility trailer and the work great when they aren't getting drowned weekly."
512891,Carp,2010-10-18 23:33:00,1488,"Always had trailer light issues in the past. I've been using magnetic tow lights for quite a few years now, trouble free. Only takes a minute to remove them when launching and just a bit longer to put them on. Reason for the extra time to re-install is because I put plastic cable ties in a criss cross patters around the magnetic base and secure to trailer frame. If you go over bumpy roads, railway tracks, etc, they could be shaken loose and fall off. The cable ties get snipped off at the launch and thrown out. I install new ones before leaving the launch. Only cost a few dollars for a pack of 100.  Problem solved and the removable lights can be used for multiple trailers."
512895,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 23:41:00,2690,"  Yupper, we talked about this yesterday.  Which is why I searched Princess Auto, and, happened to see the kit on sale.  I messed around for a few minutes tonight...stripped the ground wire down and re-connected it.  Didn't make one bit of difference!  Ticks me off that this trailer is that new and has problems with the wiring already!"
512905,irishfield,2010-10-19 00:05:00,26272,I've found most of the easy loader trailers out of North Bay.. they take a ground wire with a wire ring on the end and slip it over the light housing mounting bolt and then install the light. They don't even bother scrapping the paint off the frame to get a good ground. Remove.. scrap.. reinstall and Bob's your uncle.
512907,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-19 00:08:00,2690," Nice!!  That will be tomorrow night's experiment!!!  I still want to convert to LED's eventually, but, it would be nice to get these working for the short time left this year."
512908,cranks bait,2010-10-19 00:12:00,721,I have led lights on my trailer.  I do tow in the snow and have never had a problem with build up.  Just a reference not argueing as I can see it happening.  I have a bad habbit of forgetting to unplug my lights when I put the trailer in the drink.  I do not miss having to carry spare bulbs and fuses because guaranteed I would be blowing something every trip.  Haven't had to rplace anything since I switched.  Another plus is having lights on the trailer to make it easier to load when there is total darkness at the ramp.  It's like going up a runway for boats.
512910,Roy,2010-10-19 00:14:00,13728,"Also, lots of these trailers are shipped on floats piled several high. The ground wire out the front is often squashed by the weight of the trailers above it. They don't look at that stuff. Trust me, it happens."
512954,Whitespinnerbait,2010-10-19 03:12:00,2038,Junk .....  Just like the rest of the stuff they sell
