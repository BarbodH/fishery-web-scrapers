511824,singingdog,2010-10-14 17:16:00,1047,"I'm looking for shops, preferably Eastern GTA/Oakville area, that carry the Spro Little John crankbaits. If anybody has a lead, I would appreciate it. No, BassPro doesn't have them (unless the person I talked to on the phone was wrong). Thanks all!!"
511829,ADB,2010-10-14 17:37:00,444," Nope, you're right, BPS doesn't carry them.  Last time I checked, Le Baron does.  Give their Mississauga location a call."

511867,muskeybugged,2010-10-14 20:26:00,282,Spro made a wicked-awesome Spook like topwater but discontinued it for some reason.  Any leads where I could get some of those would be appreciated.  Sorry about the High Jack
512020,singingdog,2010-10-15 10:52:00,1047," Do you mean the Dawg?. I know a shop that has them on 3 for the price of 2 right now. If you want some, let me know.  Thanks to everyone for the leads."

512725,superdad,2010-10-18 12:53:00,353,We had some great brown fishing in the spring on a Spro lure. It was discontinued BUT a phone call to the factory and they were able to take my CC and mail them to me. They had some still on hand.  Perhaps that's the way to go for discontinued favourites.
