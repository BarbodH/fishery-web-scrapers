512541,GBW,2010-10-17 19:47:00,8460,"that last pic is funny, nice."
512543,Roy,2010-10-17 19:57:00,13728,"Good stuff, Rob. I can hear the canon dude yelling to his captain. "" Sir, we's gunna need bigger balls!"""
512712,corvette1,2010-10-18 11:51:00,1765,get ready fire nice pictures
512756,Fish Farmer,2010-10-18 15:20:00,2234,Saving that picture   Good picture of Quinte and Picton bay. I wonder if they know it's wrong pointing a firearm.
512769,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-18 16:19:00,2582,Thx for sharing. The canon pointing at the ship
512862,kickingfrog,2010-10-18 22:09:00,8333," Maybe not Roy, there are about 40 cannons all pointing at the harbour. I guess someone figured that is where an attack would come from.  Heading home tonight, I'll post a few photos soon."
512876,Roy,2010-10-18 23:04:00,13728," Well it doesn't quite work that way if you know the history of Fort Henry.  Have a safe trip back, Rob."
