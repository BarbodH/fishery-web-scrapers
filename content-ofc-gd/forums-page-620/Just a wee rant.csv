512423,misfish,2010-10-17 01:54:00,29133,"Ok,I bought my new hunting blind and it is awesome.Lots of room.BUT, I MEAN BUT,why do they have to use velcro for everything? Why not magnets? This is a hunting blind,so that means, QUIET.When you go to pull down the mesh window,it aint QUIET.NEENEE. Every creature in the bush is running saying NEE NEE,you aint getting me today.  You would think a hunting company would know this eh.  Wee rant done."
512424,Muskieman,2010-10-17 02:00:00,2472,I have a rainsuit that's like that...LOUD VELCRO!!!  Makes me think that if I wear it..It'll scare the fish away..  I was thinking some kind of HEAVY DUTY ...Ziploc sorta thing.. I think that that would work.  Randy

512466,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-17 11:40:00,0, Call the company and complain. Tell them about your magnet idea! Maybe they will throw you something free!
512467,bushart,2010-10-17 11:45:00,2628,Probably like most products---the designer never hunted a day in his life and the offshore company that made it just copied a design from someone else.
