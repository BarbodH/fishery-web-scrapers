513478,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-20 23:19:00,947,be best to have a truck or something for St John or you can go pass the train tracks and make your first right into the trailer park there is a paved launch but is very steep and you might have to pay
513490,cheaptackle,2010-10-20 23:35:00,849,Trailer park is already closed for the season.  I also heard of another launch over by the airport but haven't been down that way yet.  Michael
513516,Kerry,2010-10-21 00:37:00,383,their is.its the same spot you go out from ice fishing.Its pretty shallow once the water is dropped but you dont need to go far from their for fish either.If you go out of stepan stay to the outside right of the big rock but as you back in guide your trailer so it angles in slightly to your left backing in.Their is a drop off kind of behind the rock and your trailer will be a bit more square to it.
