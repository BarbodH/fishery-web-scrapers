Bass haven would have been great but they have a two night minimum.  The cheaper the better.  Id even consider camping if they have boat slips.  Ill be fishing Thames river or mitchele bay areas.  Thanks  Steve"
513093,bow slayer,2010-10-19 19:24:00,1074,Your best bet would be either Chatham or Wallaceburg they both have motels and are only 15-20 minutes away.
513103,kickingfrog,2010-10-19 19:37:00,8333,Hotwire might be an option to look at.

513127,Handlebarz,2010-10-19 20:51:00,3790,super 8 in chatham is $75 a night and your 25 min from the boat launch on the river and about 30 min from MB. A couple guys were down last weekend parked there boat's right outside there rooms no problems at all.

513484,Handlebarz,2010-10-20 23:26:00,3790,The reason I suggested the one in Chatham is he wants to fish BH or out from the Thames but for sure there are always great nights spent at the dragon.
513521,mistaredone,2010-10-21 01:19:00,913,Is Chattam rough?  I had a motor stolen last fall and really don't want to go to sleep worrying about my boat.
