513121,ctranter,2010-10-19 20:09:00,543,"Both of my parents were principals.  Almost all of my family friends were somehow related to education.  Now that I am a certified teacher, I think it's hilarious how parents attack teachers for their child's inability to perform at grade level.  I'm certain in 95% of those cases, the parent's spend 0-10 minutes or less with their kids daily on improving/catching up.  My mom was a teacher in my middle school down the hall from me before she became a VP.  You wouldn't believe the ridiculous standards I was held to at school.  Any, and all, of my indiscretions were brought to her attention, and boy did I hear about it.  After hearing a story of juvenile misbehaviour like this, I see it as a failed opportunity to teach the kid about the seriousness of his actions, and the impact it can have on the entire community.  The fathers reaction is what makes me sick to my stomach.  Every good parent feels a sense of obligation not just to his own family, but the community as a whole.  Unfortunately, some tight-knit ""small town""-like communities are becoming unhinged by a new generation of abstract parents who raise their kids without consequences."

We can't make anyone pay for anything....and the only real way we can even remotely do that is if they had agreed to fix your window in a certain time period or they'd be charged as per the ""it never works"" alternative measures...."

To me these guys should be in jail and my family should be allowed to sleep at nights ,as it is now I sleep on the couch with a bat , when things(bricks , rocks , metel bars , thank god so far nothing on fire) come flying thru one of my windows I run out ,but so far have not been able to catch anyone.I know the police have a tough job BUT !!!!! what did I do to deserve this ,work in same job for 37 years , payed all my taxes never even had a speeding ticket , now my family cant sleep for the fear they will be burned in their beds ,because they would not give away there phones ???????????"

I was never much of a trouble maker, but after that day.......it was engrained in me to never become one.  Bottom line......i dont believe it's the posters job to pamper or cradle or walk on eggshells in regards to the kid who made the mistake. It is the posters job to do everything in his power to protect HIS kids sitting in their own living room. Hes responsible for teaching HIS kids, and from past threads i can remember.............he knows exactly what hes doing and doesnt need any help in that department.  I wouldnt lose a wink of sleep knowing that i did everything i could to remove any fear my kids had of sitting in their own living room to watch cartoons."
513007,SBCregal,2010-10-19 13:43:00,688,"i was that kid at one point.  in gr 7 or 8 i was hanging out with kids i shouldnt have and what not.  one had a bb gun that he brought to school one day. after school we were shooting cans and whatnot and i ended up shooting a window in the school.  the principal found out it was me, and called the police (i was also suspended from school for 5 days) the police ended up charging me with careless use and discharging a firearm within town limits.  i ended up going through the court process, hiring a lawyer etc. in the end the fine/penalty wasnt that much, but the lesson learned was IMMENSE.  it straightened me out a TON, well...that and the ""talking to"" i got from my old mans belt when i got home.  had the police not been called i probably would've ended up hanging out with that same group of kids for a much longer time...who knows what troubles i would've gotten into later down the road.  splashhopper, you definitely did the right thing.... it may steer him away from getting into further trouble...maybe.   ryan  edit... i'm not saying ive been an angel since, believe me.  but it did change the path i was heading in."
513011,fisher,2010-10-19 13:50:00,451,"I look at it this way...  What if you had not called the cops and then a couple of days later you hear that the kid shot someone in the eye with that same pellet gun (maybe even your own kid)....you would feel terrible, wouldn't you.  This way, you know the gun is gone and you did all you could do to ensure the matter is dealt with."
513028,troutologist,2010-10-19 15:14:00,951,"Regardless of the other factors at play with your neighbour, police, kids attitude.  I would not tolerate for 1 second someone pointing a gun, pellet, BB or whatever at me or those in my house.  This is the apitomy of unacceptable to me, and is not the way to breed respect for firearms."
513031,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-19 15:25:00,0,"A gun, even a bb gun has no place being taken out of the house around homes.  Leaving this kids discipline in the hands of a father who allowed this to happen wouldn't work.  Knowing the police were going to take the gun away is a good thing, and it's not like the kid has a record because of this."
513041,Kwan,2010-10-19 15:55:00,132," The kids need a good role model to look up to.  The right person to give them the right advice and speak right into their heart.  Setting them up with an uncle is a possibility if the uncle has those kinds of attributes.  For me personally, it definately wasn't, because it alienated the relationship I had with my dad further-  mind you, my conflict was a family one.  Smalliefisher is dead on, though more often than not, the parent takes a secondary role or maybe is the last person a kid wants to role model from once they get to an age where friends and school what what-not dominate their lives.  A thug-inspired 14 year old can really change a 12 year old's life in a major, major negative way.  It is difficult to know where the kid is getting his stuff from, but somebody with a large age gap (like 10 years, or a parent), its increasingly important to know what the kid is up to day in and day out, who is influencing them, and then it might be a little possible to change their heart.  It's even better if they can see God in their life...  God is with each one of those struggling kids- as soon as they recognize that, its almost guaranteed to lead to a change for the better."
513045,Headhunter,2010-10-19 16:07:00,5703,"Well Kwan, I can tell you in no un-certain terms, that when I was a kid and had screwed up bad, I was hoping that God would rescue me from my Dad and his slightly worn out fan belt he yielded with never before seen accuracy! HH"
513048,misfish,2010-10-19 16:24:00,29133,"Alot of talk about bad parents.Yea there are some,but I can tell you my parents were not bad parents.I have 2 younger brothers and a sister.They were no where near as bad as me.I think it,s cause the whoop,ns I got,scared the crap out of them. Both parents worked,pop 2 jobs at times.Lots of time for this little brat to find some trouble.  So it,s not always about the parents."

513052,blarg,2010-10-19 16:38:00,289,"I wonder how much we've given up, and how much society has changed since women have gained power (which they should) because of the  ""But hey, I do want to sleep in the same bed as my wife so I call the police."" factor.  When I see how feminized and soft our society has become I tend to think we willingly give in to much and too often because we like sex so much.  Maybe more kids would be more disciplined if we weren't always trying to be nice in order to not raise the ire of our wives while disciplining their ""babies""..There is no doubt it happens."
513053,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-19 16:41:00,10439,  And there's your reason kids today think they can get away with anything. The parents have been handcuffed and are unable to discipline their kids. Taking their XBOX away does squat!!!

513056,misfish,2010-10-19 16:57:00,29133,  Sad story here in Barrie a couple years ago.Parents doing just that.
513057,fishing n autograph,2010-10-19 17:07:00,2540,"The problem is with both parents and the children. Somewhere along the line helicopter parents start to instill the ""my kid can do no wrong"" mentality and the kid believes that. So when I arrest a young person, and even if it is cut and dry and caught your child red handed the parents still say ""my kid didn't do it"". My parents god love them, didn't do the greatest job with me but by god if I screwed up and was arrested, I think I'd be sitting in the cell as punishment.  On the flip side, if a shop lifter gets caught, he goes to his first appearance and gets his free lawyer, you can guarantee he's not getting anything that would change his behavior other than community service or a donation to charity. So what is the deterrent?  But, when you look at it, parents today, with the lifestyle everyone leads parents are too busy to notice what their kids are doing until they get a phone call.  But, there are still great parents out there and when you look at the big picture, the troubled kids are few and far between.  I just hope my kids don't take the attitude that ""my dad's a cop so can do what I want"" or else they'll be taught a good lesson lol"
513066,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-19 17:42:00,2582,"I used to believe bad parents where 100% to blame for how a kid turns out.  Years ago I had this very chat with a fellow soccer dad who was also a High School principal. He told me stories of great kids who came from terrible homes and terrible kids who had the best parents you could imagine. His opinion was you are who you are. Over the years I have come to the conclusion that his take on ""problem kids"" is more accurate then mine.  You are who you are and the only one who can figure that out is you.  Hopefully the kid next door shooting out windows figures it out."
513070,GBW,2010-10-19 17:46:00,8460,"My dad was a cop until I was 6.  I was one of those kids' growing up that figured I could get away with anything because of it.  BOOOY was I WRONG!  What's worse was everyone on the street knew he was a cop.  So when the fire dept. pull up and haul me out of the truck after nearly burning down a small forest, it didn't go over well...  All the kids' in the area disappeared as they knew what was going to happen.  As Russell Peters said Somebody gonna get a-hurt real bad"".  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn5jlrxcpkI&feature=related  Did I mention I too had a bbgun?  Because my dad was a cop I was taught about the dangers and use of guns at a very young age.  Alas, he did quit being a cop when he found me playing with the revolver..."
513076,jimmer,2010-10-19 18:03:00,2730,"I second that.  Some kids just have to go through it all and learn from experiences and parents don't necessarily have anything to do with it. I can't believe that some on here actually believe that hitting a child/youth with an object is acceptable. Who do you think that those kids are going to take it out on? Other kids maybe? Learning a behaviour like that just spells trouble to me. Yes, children need discipline or incarceration, not violent acts against them. Adding role models into a child/youth's life is the way to go!  That could be the police officer that deals with the youth properly or the uncle or even the person who started this thread (that would actually be more influential than a beating in my books). Yes I live in a less violent area than many, but I grew up for 20 years in the Jane/Finch area and have seen it all. I actually got closer to being shot up here than ever in the corridor. LOL Thanks for listening, I just can't ever imagine beating a child/youth with anything."
513086,Headhunter,2010-10-19 19:06:00,5703,"Well Jimmer, I'd say that times have certainly changed, a lot, since I was a kid. Back in my day (crap I sound old) if a teacher told my parents that I was bad, for what ever reason, my parents immediately BELIEVED THE TEACHER!!! I can tell you that today, should a student mess up and the parents get called, the parents immediately take the position that their child could not have done that or it's the school/teachers' fault. All sense of accountability for actions are gone... which brings me to your other point about beating a child... well I, as mentioned earlier in this thread, had parents who believed in corporal punishment. To my mind, it was a highly effective tool. I second guessed all my moves, based on the extent of the beating I would get, should I get caught. It taught me two main things: -think twice before you do something wrong and to follow that gut reaction I would get just thinking about messing up! -DON""T GET CAUGHT!!!!!!!!!!! Probably the lesson I learned best... my brother, well he never really got that message! LOL HH"

513097,jimmer,2010-10-19 19:29:00,2730,"I hear your point HH.  I grew up with minimal corporal punishment and learned fast to listen to my parents. However, not all kids have the ability to reason in the way you and I did, therefore, hitting can bring out a worse behaviour in certain children.  They learn to hit others to get their message across. It is sad that the parents do not take a united front with teachers (I always did), but I also know that there are some teachers that should not be teaching any children. They are burned out and have no patience for the differences in children. It is definitely a different society today."
513101,Headhunter,2010-10-19 19:36:00,5703,"Absolutely Jimmer! I agree 100%... I feel that the world has gone from being mostly black and white, to a world where grey is the expected norm. There is no one answer to all problems, life would be way to simple if it were. One can find exceptions to every rule. HH"
513113,misfish,2010-10-19 19:52:00,29133," I could never master the first part,was more custom to the second.   It,s a whole new world from when we were kids."
513117,Rod Caster,2010-10-19 20:01:00,5784," Just like you HH, my parents always took the side of authorities, teachers, other parents when I pulled dumb stunts. It sure pissed me off then and I always thought they were against me. Reminiscing about those times, my parents now see it my way!!! GRRR hahaha. ""WHAT!! you actually thought the teacher was WRONG?? "" They provided me with unconditional love and a sense of civility that I am now grateful for. Parents should be parents not friends and enablers. Kids will grow and appreciate good parenting.  EDIT: Splashopper, I think what you did was ok. You're not the parent or the kid so your not to blame for anything. If the dad hates you after this, then nuts to him."

I think the issue is that Splash went to the neighbor's yard had his fit...had the adult chat then went to the cops!  I don't feel bad for the kid...he needs a kick in the butt or a scare...but I'm sure ""dad"" doesn't deserve the headache according to how Splash told US himself how ""dad"" handled the confrontation!!??

512960,camillj,2010-10-19 04:32:00,1988,"I gotta agree with Roy on this one ... it's amazing how much good a little honest heart to heart can have (if your goal is to improve the situation for the long term) ... on the other hand ... if the dad's first reaction was 'now you've cost us even more money' instead of ... 'thank GOD nobody was hurt - what were you THINKING son !"" ... then maybe dad needs a little wake up call too ... sometimes sorry just isn't good enough."
512961,danc,2010-10-19 04:40:00,4677,"If I did such a thing when I was a kid I would have had bruises on my backside for the next two weeks at least. Having known that, I never would have done such a thing."

512969,solopaddler,2010-10-19 09:55:00,8605," Yeah well if the dad had come over after the fact, apologized to you and offered to make things right would you have told the man what your intentions were?  I'm guessing you would've told him ""the police are going to be called""  Which would have been the right hing to do.  In this case the police were called after pressure from the OP's wife.  After the neighbour came over to apologize.   Considering the circumstances I would never have called the police in the first place. But everyone's entitled to their opinion."
512971,splashhopper,2010-10-19 10:18:00,2931,"  I think you may have missed a very important point here solo...  The kid was not told to apologize... I didn't see that either until my wife pointed it out to me. His father accepted responsibility for the kids actions. In some circles, that would be considered ENABLING.  It is very easy to be a ""backyard"" quarterback after the fact.  Our family ( my wife and I) took the actions that we deemed appropriate for our family last night.  I can play the "" backyard "" quarterback all day too.... and I did for a few brief moments after I called the police. And then I stuck with my wife's wishes and haven't reconsidered since.  btw..Our particular townhouse is separated from this kids home on the street behind us by a pathway and green area that a lot of children use everyday to play in everyday.  Thank GOD, none of the kids were out there when this happened and didn't get one of the bb's in the eye.  And maybe, just maybe, the kid did get the crap scared out of him by his dad and the police last night and he will have learned more respect for the bb gun and its power.  The glass window is a very small price to pay for a lesson that needs to be learned if the kid is going to have access to guns."
512972,Tarzan's Jane,2010-10-19 10:39:00,1183,"Half a dozen of this, half a dozen of that.  I fostered children years ago.  Very sad to say but some children do not respond to adult sit downs and talking.  Some children are troubled.  Some children need help.  I know this from experience.  Fostered a 7 year old, most mixed up little boy I have ever met.  He was violent....so violent.  I lasted one week short of a year - just couldnt do it anymore - I was worn out, completely.  His story is a very sad one, after leaving my home, he went to two others - no other home could handle him more than 2 weeks.  Both homes shut down and refused to do anymore fostering.  I am not exaggerating -this was one very ill boy - at 7 years of age!!! I was told by CAS that the last home he was in, the police had to be called.  Even the police had a difficult time calming this child down.  The only thing that worked was placing the little guy in the back of the cruiser and turning the lights and sirens on at the little boys request. The system ended up placing this 7 year old into a group home and heavily medicated him.  He would be 16 today.  I keep watching for his name in the paper....as much as I hate to admit it....I believe he will seriously hurt someone someday and possibly take a life. Who do I blame....his mother.  If she would have backed off, I had a chance with him and he had a chance with me....and I blame CAS for allowing that woman to hurt him time and time again.  When an organization such as the Children<s Aid Society fails a child....I have no words that would ever come close to expressing how I truly feel about that.  I just get too angry sometimes when I think of that little boy and how we all failed him.  You did nothing wrong - hopefully the father will be given some resources on how to deal with his son."
512973,cranks bait,2010-10-19 10:42:00,721,"While i see this as kids being kids.  I think it's too late to have a heart to heart with this kid.  Should have been done a long time ago to teach him respect and values.  It's a tough call because it is your neighbors.  BUT the fact of the matter is he shot a firearm into your house.  This is 100% a police call, I don't care who it is.  Yes it was only a bb, but it can still do some major damage.  What if the kid figures he can get away with this gun and how easy it is, then he finds a more powerful gun?  I hope the police scared the crap out of him to straighten him out."

You talked to the father and called the cops   .Will it work,Im sure you will find out.  Not saying it wont work for the kid, but sometimes it takes a few years to learn. Hell took me awhile. I was very rebelous in my boyhood days.   Twi,I totally understand your post.

512984,fish_fishburn,2010-10-19 11:34:00,1311,A similar situation happened to me as a kid. By age 11 my buddies and I all had pellet guns and sling shots. We would hunt in the bush behind my house for rabbits birds and whatever else moved. When that got boring we started hunting each other. Then one day Larry got shot in the nose and had to go to the hospital. All our dads were soldiers at the time and was my oldman ever pissed at me. Our dads sat the five of us down on the back step and made us watch as our weapons were destroyed with a hacksaw. Some of the boys were crying but I think I was crapping my pants because I was pretty sure I was dead meat when I got home. By 14 we all had our hunters safety courses and hunting licence's and never had an issue with weapons again. I was suprised my oldman didn't take me to the woodshed when we got home but we had a serious man to boy talk. Now throwing firecrackers at my sister and her friends won me a free ticket to the woodshed. I still remember that one. Wasn't pretty.
512985,mbac31,2010-10-19 11:36:00,904,"I would like to chime in on this one. I'm not taking anyones side here either. I would like to mention that ""I was that kid"" Twilight, that kid you speak of was nothing compared to me. Just for example, I had burned down 2 houses before the age of 10. BB guns were peoples least worry when it came to me. Cops never did scare me when I was little, neither did a good beating with a switch or anything else to be honest. I was just a little bugger with no other intention other than how much crap can I stir up today. Numerous instances I could mention dont matter. I was thrown in Juvie and medicated like some had mentioned here, great idea, lets shove him in the corner and forget about him. This is an awesome way to deal with kids. I do thank my Parents for having the patience to not have given me up. My Dads theory was that he will eventually break me no matter what. Parents give up to dam easy now adays. There are more important things in life like racing home to get that frozen dinner in the microwave and making sure they get to see greys anatomy's season premier. Oh, are you finished that frozen boxed crap, well off to bed, love you. What a freekin joke. Most parents are to blame for their kids being influenced by Gangs, etc. Gangs have been around since Christ.  The system sucks, and no kid deserves to be in it at all. To many people with diplomas on their walls that have not a clue why they got it in the first place.  There were a few instances that I have never forgotten in my life as a kid. There were 3 people that along the way that helped m in ways to which I still cant thank them enough. Somewhere along the lines of what Roy speaks of. 2 teachers and one outsider. These people didnt se me as a little bugger needing a pill or a switch beating. They saw me as a kid that needed to be challenged. They would appeal to me in ways that others with these so called diplomas never thought of because I was seen as a number to them and thats it. They got through to me and explained to my parents how to do so as well. Mind you, the time I did spend in school I never got a B in my life. I have always gotten A's. I had skipped three grades in school and never had to open a book to learn something. Just one of those kids that figured most was just common sense kinda thinking and went with that, funny thing is. I never swore at someone older than me and always said hello and helped everyone in my community with either shovelling snow or whatever. So I wasnt an easy little bugger to figure out if ya know what I mean.  I know its a funny thing to say but I never really got it until others starting getting me and having respect for me. These 3 people in my childhood are to this day still very good friends of mine. I go home every year and they are my first stops. One has sadly passed away. The other 2 are 2 teachers that I had who took the time unlike teachers of today.  A few years ago I had the chance to confront one of those so called individuals whom I would like to add was charged after I got out of Juvie. This person was as mixed up as I was and is often the case with most of them. I did not know how I would react to him at all. Instead, much to my surprise I was very friendly to him and had a beer with him. Sat and talked with him for over an hour at a local bar. When I got up to leave he and his other friend asked me my name. When I stated who I was the man went white. I preceeded to tell him that there was no hard feelings and that I dont blame him. After all, look how I turned out. I have wnt on to college and university and various other schools, a sucessfull business and a lovely home, a wife who I adore and a Little girl who is my world. I read to her every night even if I'm in Quebec fishing the Berkly B1. I take her everywhere. Dicipline has been introduced to her as well, does she like it, no but has learned lessons even at 19 months.  I still beleive that there is good in every kid. They are still just kids mind you and to many people forget that. To many kids have to grow up to fast. Never being able to be a kid. I live in Toronto and se my other friends giving their kids to long of a leash. I still beleive that Kids hav to spanked no matter what. Society as a whole has come along way in the advancement of what a kid can learn in 2010. I look at it this way. I never sit in front of a TV and let it watch me watch it. Kids cant smell a flower from the inside of the house. They need excerise, outdoors, indoors and a multitude of things. We are their teachers and if we teach them to do the wrong things they in turn do the same never really changing just evolving into better forgetters.   There are some people reading this and saying whatever, its not that easy. Well no its not but nothing ever is. I see to many kids in 2010 living their lives indoors. To may parents whining about the cell phones, cameras, computers. Etc. They can all be used outdoors. They us that as an excuse. I have a DVD player for my boat that keeps my daughter happy while Daddy is Pre Fishing. I dont gte to spend that much time out there but she is still outdoors, gets to tough every fish and see what Im doing rather than leave her at the Daycare until I get back. Alot of Parents are Lazy in 2010. There lives are far to busy and they leave it up to the over crowded classrooms etc to teach them as its their job.   You wonder why kids get into trouble with Gangs. These gangs show them the respect they deserve. Funny isnt it."
512986,jbailey,2010-10-19 12:07:00,866,"smalliefisher - your story sounds all too familiar. Kids/Teens need something to occupy their time, and parents need to be aware of who they are hanging around and what they are choosing to do with their spare time. Until I found fishing I was ""considered"" a lost cause. Some charges, some therapy and an attitude change worked collectively to change my thought process which would reflect in my behaviour. Occupying my time with fishing basically saved my life."
512987,solopaddler,2010-10-19 12:11:00,8605,Marvin I think your daughter's lucky to have you as her dad.
512988,smally21,2010-10-19 12:12:00,993,"it seems like the actions of the father demonstrated remorse, frustration, etc. so that's good.  unless i missed it has anyone asked where the pellet gun came from? the kid didn't walk into canadian tire and buy it did he???  so 'dad' here, knows his kid is a hellraiser and a trouble maker.  dad also knows there is no room for pellet guns unless you live on the farm or something a little more rural.  but superdad goes out and buys the kid a pellet gun, probably doesn't teach him squat about safety or what have you, then lets him out in the backyard with another kid to shoot the gun 'unsupervised'.  so in spite of his positive reaction to your complaint he has alot of responsibilities here....."
512990,misfish,2010-10-19 12:20:00,29133,  Thanks for taking the time to type that up.  You have to have lived it to understand it.  Did we ever hook up at 311?
512991,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-19 12:32:00,4399," The parents couldn`t handle the little PR anymore because they have let this angel get away with poop a little too long, they and everybody else this   comes in contact with is now paying the price for there lousy parenting."
512992,Harrison,2010-10-19 12:36:00,2202,"I'd bet the kid would of been happy to sit in the cruiser, would give him more street cred and something to post on facebook.  Depending on the Dads attitude, I probably would of let him handle it.  Then again, maybe not, as the kid is a product of his environment.  He needs someone to respect.  Smalliefisher - If I remember right you asked about being a big brother a while ago.  After reading your story I beleive you really could influence a youngsters life who is need."
512993,tb4me,2010-10-19 12:52:00,3295,"Well written Smalliefisher..Good on you for that.I myself can kinda relate to the father. My son threw a rock that oddly bounced of a gazebo and smashed the neighbours window.The neighbour came over to our house and accused our son of ""shooting out the window with a gun"" As it turned out im a local contractor and was able to fix it. The neighbour was convinced he shot out her window and we didnt even have a gun. After a long conversation with me and my son present she finally undersottd it was a freak accident. Well in an atempt to keep a long story short no Police were called. The funny thing was after I threatened to put my foot you know where (on the boy) it turned out the lady worked for childrens aid..Yikes! She then proceeded to tell me I had a good bright young boy. She could have made it much worse than it was thats for sure. In your situation I would have done the same.with the fact that it was a gun and add the fact that Dad had enough (and clearly couldnt control his boy) the Police clearly needed to be involved..Now im thinking your house wasnt the first shot.I wonder how many other houses have chipped glass and dented siding. Good luck to you and your family going forward."
512994,mattybculp,2010-10-19 12:55:00,388,"Its amazing these days the lack of respect some kids have. Im not a young guy but, gone are the days of that fear for authority figures ( ie parents,police,or teachers). My parents never beat me but there was always a calming respect and fear of what the consequences of my actions would be.I live in a decent neighbourhood now and live beside this family (obviously disfunctional) whos kids are 6 and 11. The things these kids are saying are things that i wasnt saying till my first year of midget hockey. It doesnt matter what time of day, sunday morning, you can hear explenatives 8 houses away. they will sit there on the side of the road where the speed limit is like 15 and throw pebbles at peoples cars as they drive by, standing right on the curb 5 feet from you ! The balls on these kids are incredible. Not need to hide or run away. You get out of the car and and they basically say to go screw yourself. An 11 year old ! my jaw just dropped.I go right to the parents and within 3 seconds i understand where the kids are getting it from. I call the cops but trust me that fear just isnt there anymore,the kid puts the face on for 10 mins and then pooof the cop leaves and hes right back to normal. I think its sad to say but i think the days of heart to hearts are dwindelling there maybe a few left that will genuinely listen and absorb the advice you give them, but sadly i think for the most part that number is getting smaller. Damn Media!"
512997,fishing n autograph,2010-10-19 12:59:00,2540,"Here's my take on it... I've worked with ""troubled"" kids for most of my life, but now that I'm on the ""other"" side and I'm not counselling kids anymore I'm kind of stuck between what I've learn prior to LE and what I've learned since. If I run into a kid and it's his first time w/ the police and he just stole a candy bar you can tell if he's gonna be a repeat customer. I tend to scare the absolute crap out of them by giving a great lecture and often times the walk out of the store in cuffs and having mom and dad pick them up from the back of my car is a good way to correct the behaviour. Unfortunately they're are a lot of kids that have had it tough and the parents have failed. These are the ones that call 911 because their 8 year old won't eat their peanut butter sandwich or their 9 year old won't listen. I tend to lay it out for the parents and tell them its not my job to raise their kids. I have 2 of my own that I'm responsible for."
512868,splashhopper,2010-10-18 22:47:00,2931,"Was sitting in the living room watching the TV with my wife and daughter and here a loud PING right behind my head on the living room window.  Upon closer inspection,,,, a little bullet hole !  I look out and there is two kids playing with a pellet gun... I get a real quick look at the clothes and then run out the door to confront them.  I went through the neighbors back yard and there they are.  Playing ball hockey all innocent like in the driveway in front of the garage.  I yell at the kid and ask what the hell he is doing shooting up my window with his pellet gun not knowing his dad was in the garage!  Dad comes flying out of the garage and start giving his kid crap and telling him that he has just cost their family MORE Money.  Then the dad immediately turns to me and asks if anyone was hurt.  No thank goodness.  He grabs the pellet gun and takes it in to the house.  While the dad is in the house for about 45 seconds the kid looks at me with a REAL SMIRK on his face as if to say : what the hell are u gonna do about it, I am just a kid!  The dad immediately accepts responsibility  and comes with me to look at the window.  I get his number and address and then we get the property manager on the phone with him as well.  He tells her that he is accepting responsibility as well. ( we'll see)  I then tell the father about the kids attitude with me and he tells me that is the same problem the teachers are complaining about at his school.  I go back in the house and my wife is PISSED when i tell her about the kids attitude. She tells me to call the police. At first I didn't want to because the dad is taking responsibility.  But hey, I do want to sleep in the same bed as my wife so I call the police.  .  They tell me that it is a by law infraction and will be over at 9:30 to look at the window and take a report. They will then be confiscating the gun.  Now my wife is happy... sort of.  She then says, what if the kid is a real S>O>B and decides to throw a rock through the window...  to pay us back for the grief that is coming to their house later tonite....   I just hope the parents don;t get charged with this... or maybe I do hope they get charged,,, i don't know how I feel about that yet... I mean the guy accepted responsibility for kids actions and all.  For now, I am just keeping our family away from that window and have informed the neighbors on both sides about the situation.  I am headed out for an ""A""titude ""A""djustment and will be back to deal with the police.  Stay tuned.  I will keep u updated as this plays out."

512881,bassmaster4,2010-10-18 23:12:00,801,"man, i dont know about calling the police the guy took responsibility thats probably what he was trying to avoid."
512884,solopaddler,2010-10-18 23:20:00,8605, That was my thought as well.  If I was going to call the cops I would have been upfront with the dad about it.
512885,pikehunter,2010-10-18 23:23:00,1659, Agreed.

Ian"
512889,mercman,2010-10-18 23:32:00,7054,i woulda called the cops....as long as the pellet gun is in the house the kid will find it and use it again.what if it had of been a .22 or a shotgun.Authorities must be involved and the seriousness of this must be stressed upon the parent as well as the child.Sad fact is that these punks are just as dangerous if not more dangerous than an adult.They know they wont be prosecuted.
512890,Tom McCutcheon,2010-10-18 23:33:00,627,"  I understand the dilema you feel, however it could be that the parents have been ""buying"" the little brat out of trouble for quite some time and he will never learn his lesson. This is a firearm so to speak and it is better that the kid learns about being responsible for his actions now rather than later when he may cause serious injury to someone.    Good luck.  Tom."
512892,HTHM,2010-10-18 23:36:00,4082,I don't think I could have been as restrained as you were. The kid would of had some memory of my hands....
512893,solopaddler,2010-10-18 23:37:00,8605, I like the concept of people taking responsibility for their own actions. Or in this case for those who they're guardians of.  I would have at least given the father the opportunity to set his kid straight.  After all it's up to us as parents to raise them properly. Nobody else is going to do it.
512899,ctdd2006,2010-10-18 23:45:00,531," I agree.  By the way the conversation with ""dad"" apppeared to go, it sounds like he would have taken care of things and that gun was history!  It's an unfortunate situation, but at the end of the day they are your neighbors and you're going to have to live next door!  I hope it all plays out well for you though....  Dad may not be as quick to to help in the replacement though!?  I'd also be calling my insurance."
512929,splashhopper,2010-10-19 01:35:00,2931,"To all those that say I shouldn't have called the police I ask you this:  There is one piece in my original post that said: "" I then tell the father about the kids attitude with me and he tells me that is the same problem the teachers are complaining about at his school.""  The dad also told me that if i didn't see the kid around for a few days it would be because he was being sent off to his uncle because he( the dad) couldn't handle him anymore.  My wife hit it on the head, if the kid was respectful he wouldn't have the arrogant attitude about him.  We have a saying in the recovery world: bring the bottom UP and maybe save a life or two.  It would be very interesting to have the police officers that frequent this board to offer up there experience with the young offenders.  Bottom line, I am not interested in having ANY parent charged that takes responsibility for their kids.  The law will decide that, not me and my FEELINGS.  Stay tuned, the police are due here anytime now( 9:30pm Oct 18)  Splashhopper"

The best thing I can think of when something like that happens is to grab the kid and have a heart to heart. Sit on the sidewalk with the kid....tell him how you feel about stuff. It'll usually turn out that the kid will become a best friend. But hey, that's just my opinion."

If you intended to call the police you should have told the man when he came over to talk with you.  People need to handle stuff like this themselves rather than call the police, complain to the OFC mod's or whatever.  I think Roy expressed my sentiments a little more eloquently."

( pretty smart wife I have eh !   )  They gave me a report # in case the dad isn't a stand up guy and doesn't pay for the window.  They also confirmed that there is a bylaw that forbids the discharge of firearms in the city, so this gun will be removed from the home tonight.  I also told them I was not interested in having the parents charged for anything but did want the kid to feel the consequences of HIS OWN actions.  And as I re-iterated in my previous post, the dad admitted that he couldn't handle his own kid anymore and would likely send him off to an uncle. Maybe that wasn't too clear to some of the responders in this thread.  Thanks for all the input.  Splashhopper"

512949,mercman,2010-10-19 02:51:00,7054,"its truly unfortunate but there are lots of parents who havent a clue how to handle there children.It shouldn't necessarilly reflect on the parent. Children are faced with unimaginable pressures from the school mates.They have become acclimatized to violence and are constantly pressured to join gangs or groups for acceptance and protection.Its alot tougher today than when i was a kid. However, sending the kid to live somewhere else is not solving the problem and will probably result in more resentments and feelings of abandonment. I don't know how old this kid was, but maybe the father and son should have been required to take a gun safety course together as a result of this, so that both of them will have more rerspect for each other and the gun that caused this. Hehould also be made to appologize to you Ron, in person."
512950,BillM,2010-10-19 02:55:00,17367,Cops should have sat the kid in the back of the car for a little while.  Nothing like pissing your pants in the back of a cop car to straighten you out.
