512791,GBW,2010-10-18 17:50:00,8460,Hey all. I want to paint up some jig's this winter and I was wondering if anyone here has used this product before.  Where can I get it locally too?  Thanks.
512794,OhioFisherman,2010-10-18 18:03:00,6623,"I have used it and like it, if done right it is a lot more durable than regular paint. No idea where to get it in your area though."
512795,Roy,2010-10-18 18:04:00,13728,"I use it. You can order it from luremaking.com, Geoff."
512796,GBW,2010-10-18 18:04:00,8460,"Any idea what they charge for shipping Roy?  *edit* the shipping cost more then the product, HAHAHA"

513230,GBW,2010-10-20 01:02:00,8460,Ya sure?  Randy emailed me today saying he cannot get it.  I'm just going to get off of luremaking.com (if they ever get back to me)...  But thanks all.
