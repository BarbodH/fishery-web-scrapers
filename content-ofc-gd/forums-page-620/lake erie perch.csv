512718,Billy Bob,2010-10-18 12:14:00,5865," Good Morning,  Ricky is the owner and operator of the bait shop when you turn off Rt 20 at the red light to head down to one of the three launches on the Catt... his bait shop is right there on the left only a few hundred feet from Rt 20...he took over the business from his dad Rhome Miller YEARS ago.  So I am guessing you used salted minnows ? ? ? if so were they emeralds.  Thanks, Bob"
512792,corvette1,2010-10-18 17:55:00,1765,hi bob they were from rons  bait shop in the town of niagara he said they were not emeralds but they were alive not salted i would say about 2 inch
512830,Billy Bob,2010-10-18 19:48:00,5865,"Next time you go, you can get your bait right near the Catt.....Try Googling 12711 Alleghany Road, Silver Creek, NY......or maybe this link will work....  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=12711+Alleghany+Rd,+Silver+Creek,++NY&sll=42.558907,-79.131249&sspn=0.001047,0.001725&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=12711+Alleghany+Rd,+Irving,+Chautauqua,+New+York+14081&t=h&z=16  Bob"
