510912,alexmedic,2010-10-10 23:12:00,186,"Well I decided to go the Skeg Guard route and it arrived in the mail today.  Installation was very simple and all together it took et 15 minutes to do so.  Here is a picture..    The only additional thing I did was drill an additional hole right in the middle.  The last hole (Closest to the prop) was running through the existing break.  It was only about a 1/4 of the hole, but I did not want to risk it.  On the water it was great.  I did not notice any difference at all.  So for $120.00, I am a happy man!    I just pulled a bone head after a sweet day of perch'n and broke my skeg in/on the driveway!!  It's a clean break and the bottom half is still in great shape.  [  Can anyone recommend a place to have this fixed in the Barrie area?  I have been also looking at the  skegshields/skeggards.  Does any one know if they are any good and would it work with my break?"
510914,HTHM,2010-10-10 23:16:00,4082,Any good alum welding shop should be able to help you.
510916,bassjnkie,2010-10-10 23:21:00,1101,"Really clean break. Should be fixable. I had a guy fix my prop a couple time, but he got out of it. I pretty certain Leisure Marine might help you out or recommend someone."
510929,IndySKS,2010-10-11 00:10:00,134,I know a guy in Powassan (just south of North Bay) if thats of any help
510942,cheaptackle,2010-10-11 00:55:00,849,Pretty sure the prop shop on James St. in Orillia does both prop & skeg repairs.  Michael

511121,alexmedic,2010-10-11 23:59:00,186,"Thanks for all the replies.  I ended up ordering a SkegShield from BPS.  If it works, I'll post some pics...."
511211,solopaddler,2010-10-12 09:40:00,8605,If it was me I'd fix it.  Not exactly in your area but City Wide Welding in Mississauga are the absolute best at this.  I'm guessing it would cost about $250 to have your motor like brand new again. They'll finish it as well with colour matched paint.
511229,Carp,2010-10-12 12:58:00,1488,I've had City Wide Welding in Mississauga fix props for me in the past and didn't have any complaints about their work. Never repaired a skeg though.

511261,doubleheader,2010-10-12 15:16:00,497,I pulled that smooth move one time. I put on a Skeggard and was very happy with it.
511262,tb4me,2010-10-12 15:21:00,3295,Isint that skeg casted aluminum? How does that get welded? I always that cast aluminum wasnt tigable? Am I missing somthing?
511268,cityfisher,2010-10-12 16:05:00,959,fixer up and put a skeg guard.. Worth the Cash !
511285,solopaddler,2010-10-12 17:08:00,8605, It can be welded that's all I can tell you LOL!  Maybe a welder could chime in with the science behind the craft.
511293,vinnimon,2010-10-12 17:40:00,2593,Mine almost ended up that way!A little elbow grease and know how! Solid as a rock for now!
511294,aplumma,2010-10-12 17:43:00,6896,Cast aluminum will TIG nicely it is Pot metal that does not weld.  I would go for getting it welded back together the shoes that I have seen all require you to drill holes into the remaining skeg to fasten it in place causing a weak spot and the shoe is thicker so more cavitation is possible. Check with auto repair shops in the area to see if they can repair it. They are slow now and will give you a better price on the work than any Marine shop will.   Art
