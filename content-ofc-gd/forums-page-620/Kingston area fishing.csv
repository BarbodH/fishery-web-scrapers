513530,splashhopper,2010-10-21 02:05:00,2931,I might be in Kingston the weekend of Nov 20th for a two day Taekwondo tournament with my daughter and wife.  They both said I could go fishing if i want to!  I have no clue of what to even fish for out that way.  Any suggestions ?  Thanks  Splashhopper

I still have familly on my dads side there, and apparently the fishing is still good.Would like to hear about it if you do go."
