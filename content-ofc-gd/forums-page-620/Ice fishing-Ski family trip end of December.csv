Considering the ""ski element"" it'll probably need to be in QC direction Is it possible to reserve something for few days, say.....between Dec. 24 and January 2? From what I've read on the bonjourquebec web site QC's:  ""An ice fishing trip in Qu√©bec will net you mainly walleye, yellow perch and pike. Redfish, cod and turbot are common in the Saguenay, and you're likely to catch rainbow and speckled trout up in the Laurentians.""  Not been familiar with QC geography hope someone can help with spots where the ice fishing and ski mix in relatively close proximity. And walleye ice fishing is just what the doctors prescribed me for this ice season  Any how....hope for some constructive ideas/suggestions as the clock is ticking on me and it is time to book something soon...figured there must be some Quebec ice fishermen here that also enjoy skiing that are willing to help  Cheers, Ice FIsherman"

512455,icefisherman,2010-10-17 03:23:00,952," Well Wayne,  I was waiting for several weeks for few people to reply to my PM's but decided while still waiting for them to post in the general forum as well. Appreciate the idea....checking into Tremblant right now. Will figure out something about the room I am sure, optimist by nature  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

In Vermont, you can ice fish Lake Champlain which is phenomenal for many species, or hit some of the smaller ""inland"" lakes for lakers, rainbows, big northerns, perch & crappie, walleye and bass (yes, bass is open and they are catchable through the ice).  And you can't drive 20 minutes in any direction in Vermont without running into a ski resort on one of the many peaks of the Green Mountains.  There's Killington, Pico, Sugarbush, Bolton Valley, Jay Peak, Stowe, Mad River Glen ... just to name a few.  But the chances are there being good ice isn't that great in December. There will definitely be ice on some of the smaller lakes, but it could be questionable exact where and how much."
512498,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-17 14:55:00,0,We have a ski mountain in the north but it's only 700 feet vertical... It is however nestled into some fine ice fishing country... Probably too far for you but it could be what you're looking http://www.searchmont.com/
