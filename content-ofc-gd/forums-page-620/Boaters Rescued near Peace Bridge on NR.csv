512781,Billy Bob,2010-10-18 17:02:00,5865,"http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article222742.ece  I bet I know exactly where they hit a submerged wreck that lies along the Bird Island Pier, a area called the fish market by fishermen. On calm days you can see it SOMETIMES just sticking above the water line.  Bob"
512789,mercman,2010-10-18 17:37:00,7054,one would think that they would put a marker on the wreck to avoid this kind of problem.That musta scared the caca out of them.

Problem is, not everyone is local and sometimes dont do thier homework. If im thinking the same as Billy Bob, you can tell just where you should not venture just by the characteristics of the flow above water. Im surprised there arent more issues there with the amount of pleasure boaters passing thru that area. Ive been doing it for 25 years and i still go thru there with white knuckles.  Just glad everyone made it off ok"
