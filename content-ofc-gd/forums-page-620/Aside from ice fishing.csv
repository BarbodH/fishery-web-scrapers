512644,The JAY,2010-10-18 01:04:00,239,"I love seeing what folks do, other than fishing, in their spare time; and there are some excellent examples shown!  I've got a few hobbies that I've picked up over the years: wine and beer making (that snowballed into me building my own still... 192 proof rum is scary stuff.) guitar and bass playing with my band, airbrushing, custom knife making... This winter I've got a couple of airbrush jobs lined up, and a few knives that I'm wanting to build. Add to that, cleaning up the boat I bought this year, and a few jobs around the house, and I think I'm going to have a busy winter. Here's some examples of some of the things I've done:   Custom computer case for a hard core Star Wars fan.   Airbrushed goalie mask for the Toronto Rock Lacrosse team.   Harley horn cover.   Viking Seax re-creation with a Dragon blade etching. Approx 24"" long and razor sharp.   A little utility knife with African Blackwood scales and a little file work under the thumb for grip.   A delicate little Bird and Trout knife.   A neck knife for a fly fisherman. Had a one hand, rare earth magnet sheath.   A big Camp knife with a bear etching. Bloodwood scales.   My first filet knife with Cedar and Maple scales.  Thanks for looking, and let's see some more passtimes!"

Will do a little ice fishing and probably watch a lot of hockey, maybe play a little indoor soccer.  Hoping to go on Paternity leave in February so I guess my main thing will be watching my daughter all day."

512415,aplumma,2010-10-17 01:02:00,6896,I am not sure what the winter project is this year. It will most likely be mechanical in nature and something to do with metal but as to what type I haven't decided if it will be a motorcycle or a boat? Their will also be a few new lures built and other small projects around the house.   Art
