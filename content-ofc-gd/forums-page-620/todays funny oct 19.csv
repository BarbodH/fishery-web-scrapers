512979,skeeter,2010-10-19 11:24:00,1907,"Cletus is passing by Billy Bob's hay barn one day when, through a gap in the door, he sees Billy Bob doing a slow and sensual striptease in front of an old green John Deere.  Buttocks clenched, Billy Bob performs a slow pirouette and gently slides off first the right strap of his overalls, followed by the left.  He then hunches his shoulders forward and in a classic striptease move, he lets his overalls fall down to his hips revealing a torn and frayed plaid shirt.  Grabbing both sides of his shirt he rips it apart to reveal his stained tee shirt underneath.  With a final flourish he tears the tee shirt from his body and hurls his baseball cap onto a pile of hay.  Having seen enough Cletus rushes in and says, ""What the heck are you doing, Billy Bob?""  ""Jeez, Cletus, ya scared the snot out of me!"" exclaims Billy Bob.  Then, obviously embarrassed, he says, ""Me and the old lady been having trouble lately in the bedroom department, and the therapist suggested I do something sexy to a tractor."""
