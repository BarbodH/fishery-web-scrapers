Earlier this wk (Mon) the DR was filled with ice that was flushed out of the St.Clair River by ice breakers. The warm temps have also brought S winds which helps clean the Ont side for those who don't have a Michigan license you will have fishable waters this wknd. Look for the boats and there is a good chance you will find out shortly if the walleyes are biting. Keep your line vertical and slow as water temps are only 40-43 degrees. A good selection of 1/2oz to 3/4 oz jigs in a various colours will keep you armed. Chartruese blends seem to be the preferred colour of many anglers. Live bait is not necessary but won't hurt, many run a number of plastic worm and minnow imitations with great success.  Happy Easter and have a great long wknd,"
450863,Handlebarz,2010-04-02 00:08:00,3790,A buddy was out earlier this week and did ok for the first two trips of the year but he was on the MI side of the river I wanted to get out this weekend but it looks like we might do some perch jerkin instead they were getting them at both ends of the river but did better at the Erie end of the DR. Good luck this weekend if ya get out Bob
451659,Bob Devine,2010-04-04 17:11:00,251,"Happy Easter, What a great wknd of fishing this has been. The Ont side of the D-R cleaned up very nicely and the fish were smacking. Good catches all down the Ont side from Peche Island to Fighting Island. Lots of big fish too. We boated several over 8lbs that were quickly released. Despite being a bit windy on Sat the fishing continued to be hot. A small cold front has now hit the area but winds have slowed and the fishing will continue to be good as the water warms. We are expected to have rain the next few says but that will not slow the bite. Although it is going to rain the weather will be stable and temps remain the same for the coming week. I am looking forward to fishing with 2 good friends from Arkansas on Tues Jimmy and Troy Cox, they are the owners of Mizmo plastics. "
