Its a medium sized lake and theres other small lakes nearby i might try. I know all lakes are differnt but im just looking for a general idea of what to expect because i ve never really been up there before may. Seems like a warm spring tho. Anyway i appreciate any info, even if its not really close to bancroft. So to sum it up my what i d like to know about any lake in cottage country u ve been to is wats the ice like and can i fish it? Thanks for ur time. I ll update u guys on the fishing (lakers, bows and brookies) when i get back."
