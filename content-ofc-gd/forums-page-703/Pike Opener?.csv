With the warm weather are jerkbaits going to be the main baits to throw or should I bother giving small sucker's under float's a try. I got out 4 times for the Pike (3 in pickering 1 in oshawa) and only managed 1 fish so it was definitely a hard thing to do catching them in that cold cold water.  Anyway just thought I would ask and see what people are doing. PM me if somebody wants to give me a tour of the Pike fishing in the Toronto Islands area.  Tightlines, MTBF"
