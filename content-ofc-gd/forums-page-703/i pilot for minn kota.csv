440079,JPD,2010-03-05 04:14:00,296,"A good friend of mine has been using one this winter on the Niagara and loves it. It has some great capabilities like co-pilot, auto plilot and most importantly spot lock and a route memory. you can record 2 trails up to 2 miles long and it will follow the GPS trail at whatever speed you want. The spot lock feature will hold you stationary (on a waypoint or rock pile per say) within 5 feet and you never have to touch your motor. Even if the wind increases, the motor will compensate.  The only thing is that if you put the iPilot on, there is no pedal for the unit after that, everything is controlled by the remote.. course, speed, on and off etc.  JP"
440080,workwear,2010-03-05 04:17:00,592,thxs JPD  im leaning towards buyin it.........should be fun setting a course and not worrying bout it while retying lures and such.....  was told its pretty easy to install
440169,skeeter,2010-03-05 13:55:00,1907,wow some one has finally come out with it. now when you set your course you can put a bell on the tip of your rod to wake you up if you get a hit!! 
440189,Fishn Technishn,2010-03-05 14:37:00,198,"I asked a similar question a few weeks ago.  See these links for some very helpful info  http://www.jasonhalfenoutdoors.com/2010seminars.html click on I Pilot Index  http://www.crappie.com/crappie/fishing-ele...rolling-motors/  Ipilot sticky LOTS of Opinions  Sounds like putting one on a PD2(Power drive2) is a bit of a job, but a Terrova is a snap. Gotta get me one!! There are some deals out there but make sure you get correct one for your Minn Kota!    FT"
440343,workwear,2010-03-05 23:12:00,592,thanks for the input guys.....greatly appreciated  cheers
443733,scugpg,2010-03-14 17:11:00,1373,Does anyone know if you can use the co-pilot remotes if you have an ipilot?  Having the co-pilot remote on the fishing rod is really handy; I could see the ipilot remote cumbersome in some situations but it definitely looks to be a great feature.
452505,scugpg,2010-04-06 12:09:00,1373, Turns out its one or the other according to Minn Kota.  Has anyone else tried the ipilot on the water?
