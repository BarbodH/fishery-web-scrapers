Thanks to Fishmaster, Sherry and Steve  for a great time and awesome catch out on the Lower Grand ... We fished from 6:00pm  till 9:30 pm landing 15 fish all on cut bait. The biggest fish was just under 16lbs!  The pictures will speak for themselves.              Again from all of us, thanks Steve... "
