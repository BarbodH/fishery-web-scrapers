451945,waterwolf,2010-04-05 03:47:00,556,"nice markings on your pike. shame you didn't hit more of 'em. very wide canoe, who makes it? glass or kevlar?"
451946,TDunn,2010-04-05 03:49:00,680,"Nice WD, spring pike'n is one of my favs. I also have the esox itch, but i think i'm gonna give it another 2 weeks or so... Hope you run into some better luck next time!   TDunn"
452020,WeedLine,2010-04-05 13:45:00,322,Right on. At least you got into some fish. Nice looking lake
452164,pike n' whities,2010-04-05 19:08:00,131,i was lookin for this one!
452204,pike slayer,2010-04-05 20:57:00,1177,"it says on the inside of the canoe that its a scotts... and its fiberglass, its been through hell and back, lots of portage bush miles on it. and ya in 2 weeks they should be hitting alot better, they just arent ready to spawn yet, they are on the normal time schedule and this lake is normally amazing in the summer with 50+ pike in one day and decent sizes to. nice time will be better i was a little to horny to get out"
