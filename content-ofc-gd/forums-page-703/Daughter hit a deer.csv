452646,maybo,2010-04-06 17:35:00,86,what are they going to do with that deer?

452664,capt bruce,2010-04-06 18:03:00,820,"Glad to hear she's all right , hit one myself this winter , been deer hunting for over 30 years and never got a ten point untill now , to bad it had to be with my car . I was not so lucky as he came feet first thu the window , still got large wound where his antler went thu my calf and came out the back (another scar to show grandkids), nothing like shareing the front seet with a mortally wounded deer kicking and head butting ,after i got the car stopped and rolled out the door,he still kicked and butted for another 10 minutes inside untill he finally died was no way I was getting back in the car with him to finish it, thank god another guy came by and stopped as I left my cell phone on the seat. Car a right off between the damage in the front and the mess he made (his blood and mine )on the inside ,seats console dash dystroyed by his hooves . But at least I got the last shot in as he tasted real good, what the butcher could save .I am looking into those whistles  for the new car.It all happened so fast ac/dc cranked on the radio came up over a hill and bang he was headed straight for me on the hood ."
452666,lew,2010-04-06 18:05:00,12766," Don't know what happened to it kvd, last my daughter saw was the OPP pulling it off to the side of the road. I spose anybody could have it if they wanted it.  As to the deer whistles on cars, I remember reading an article on them where studies were done and evidentely they didn't really make that much of a difference overall as many folks with them were still hitting deer on the roads.  Who knows though, perhaps they do indeed scare some critters off the road and it would be nice to think they've actually prevented some accidents."
452669,lew,2010-04-06 18:10:00,12766,"capt bruce, thanks for sharing that and it shows how bad these critter collisions can really be. Good to hear you got out alive but it sure sounds like the deer made a mess of both you and your car.  Scary stuff fer sure."
452688,Garry2Rs,2010-04-06 18:55:00,1425,"Glad to hear Sheri is okay. My next door neighbour is the visiting Nurse up here.  She drives thousands of km. on back roads every month.  Usually she hits one deer a year. Last year she had a ""Bush Bar"" installed hoping to reduce the damage her truck sustains. Garry"
452693,Bly,2010-04-06 19:11:00,1556,"Lew, So glad to hear that Sheri is ok and the bonus that the insurance company is going to take care of things."
452027,lew,2010-04-05 13:55:00,12766,"My daughter spent the weekend up here with us and then left this morning about 6:00 AM to head to the city. She'd only been gone 20 minutes and was approaching Bridgenorth when a deer came outta nowhere and she nailed it head on.  Sheri wasn't hurt at all but sadly the deer was killed instantly and her car received some serious damage.  The OPP came and took the info and moved the deer to the side of the road, then Sheri came back up here to relax a bit before heading out again and I took a couple pics of the car.  The hood & fender are totalled, the headlite smashed and the windshield cracked right across, plus the wipers are also bent and whatever else I can't see.  She called the insurance and their gonna pay for everything with no penalty to her, 'cept for her deductible.    "
452029,Sinker,2010-04-05 14:00:00,8692,Glad to hear she's Ok Lew. The car can be fixed.  S.
452030,SlowPoke,2010-04-05 14:01:00,2984,She ran over one of your neighbours??? Glad she's okay!
452033,Paully,2010-04-05 14:03:00,712,So when is dinner?
452034,Beans,2010-04-05 14:03:00,3339,Sorry to hear this Lew...Good that she was not injured...we have had close calls with deer ourselves...just one of those things living the good life in the country...seen any bears yet ???
452035,bassdreamer,2010-04-05 14:06:00,128,I'm glad your daughter is ok Lew !!
452042,Toronto_Angler,2010-04-05 14:25:00,698,Good to see everyone is ok as that could be very dangerous.  Did you get to keep the deer? would be ashame to waste that meat.
452047,TJQ,2010-04-05 14:39:00,7806,I'm glad shes fine.. whew.....
452050,lew,2010-04-05 14:44:00,12766,"Thanks guys, as you say the most important thing is Sheri wasn't injured cause it can always be worse that it is.  Nope she didn't keep the meat and I doubt it would be much good after being hit at 80K although I believe it's legal to do so.  Brian, that was the 1st thing I thought of after receiving the phone call, was it one of ""my own"" criiters that had wandered down there ??  And Norm, nope, haven't seen any bear yet myself here, but there's been reports of them all over the area the last couple years."
452054,Joey,2010-04-05 14:48:00,9122,So glad to hear she is okay Lew.  Not much you can do when a big furry animal jumps out in front of your car.  Joey
452073,shane,2010-04-05 15:54:00,652,Oh dear!
452075,Carp,2010-04-05 15:59:00,1488,Glad Sheri is alright. Good thing it wasn't a moose.
452077,Squid,2010-04-05 16:02:00,1656,Gees Sheri has the luck eh Lew?? Glad she is ok and not injured. I noticed that all the snow is gone from your area.
452081,skeeter,2010-04-05 16:06:00,1907,"she is ok and that is the only thing that matters. theres millions of cars out there but only 1 of her.  and i give her 2 thumbs up for not swerving to try and miss the dear. being a truck driver for over 27 years the first thing you learn is NOT to swerve to miss any animal, you can lock up the brakes but DONT swerve. many people swerve as an instinct reaction but that is how you end up in a ditch, flip your car or hit something else like a tree.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
452198,mattyk,2010-04-05 20:30:00,2110,Glad to hear she is ok. Same thing happen to me on Highway 9 just outside of Newmarket several years ago. Did some nice damage to the car.
452222,irishfield,2010-04-05 21:49:00,26272,I would have kept the deer to cover the deductible Lew... nothing wrong with tenderized venison!  Glad she's okay!!!
452231,pike n' whities,2010-04-05 22:04:00,131,"i wouldnt say that is ""serious"" damage but thats a pretty lucky situation at that. good thing them hooves didnt come through the window and that shes okay.......... so did the deer go over or under?"
452337,huntingtexastrophies,2010-04-06 01:09:00,2,Thanks God that your daughter is okay.  We must all be careful in driving.
452412,Nanook,2010-04-06 02:28:00,565,"Glad your daughter's OK Lew. The buggers do come from nowhere sometimes. Jackie hit one a couple of years ago, it got up and took off, she she was a nevous wreck for days after"
452416,douG,2010-04-06 02:37:00,2693,"Don't veer for deer.  Thanks for sharing the adrenaline once again, Lew."
452499,Spiel,2010-04-06 11:43:00,9065,I'm pleased that Sheri made out far better than her car Lew.
452503,Roy,2010-04-06 11:52:00,13728,Driving anywhere there's wildlife is dangerous. Really thankful that Sheri is ok.
452575,fish-miester,2010-04-06 14:37:00,864,its weird.. I saw two dead deer on the road side today on my way from port perry to lindsay this morning and a few turkeys.. that were asking to get smucked
452581,Blue Lk,2010-04-06 15:01:00,337,"Very pleased that your daughter is OK.I put ""Deer Whistles"" on my pick-up & GF's car about 5 yrs ago.I got to say,I'm a believer in these inexpensive devises. We live in NWO,lots of deer & moose.My GF drives about 130 kms 1 way to Sioux Lookout 4 work & that Hwy has lots of deer & moose as well as bear. Since I put on the whistles we have had very few close calls.B4 we had lots. You still see the animals but they seem to know you are coming."
452582,bigbuck,2010-04-06 15:02:00,2449,"Lew, good to hear your daughter is ok. Who cares about the car, your daughter is fine, you can fix or replace a car, your child....... Take care my friend."
