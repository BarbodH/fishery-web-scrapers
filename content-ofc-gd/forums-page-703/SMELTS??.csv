451410,brifishrgy,2010-04-03 19:01:00,559,caught 4 bags full last night .. not another sole around
451434,johnnyb,2010-04-03 20:44:00,3413,I've heard they're running to the north...
451487,BucktownAngler,2010-04-04 01:51:00,582, where at?
451495,Dara,2010-04-04 02:02:00,3052,Its raining here now. if it keeps up they will be going crazy next weekend
451504,ohhenrygsr,2010-04-04 02:36:00,947, LOL That will get people perked up
452460,Jonny,2010-04-06 03:59:00,1380,The smelts have started to run at Nipissing.
452504,Muskieman,2010-04-06 11:54:00,2472,  They sure are!!!  Ya can just look at them though.. unless you have a magic card. The whole of lake Nipissing is closed 'til opening day even Smelts and Coarse fish. That's too bad... we used to have a blast catching them and would have an even bigger blast cooking and eating them with a cold beer in hand.  RFS 
452547,Jonny,2010-04-06 13:44:00,1380," But if they're up in the rivers and creeks, maybe that's not Nipissing per se? I don't know the technicality of that, and judging by the people out for them, they don't know either."
452573,brifishrgy,2010-04-06 14:33:00,559,"Lake Nipissing – including the waters of the French River from the Chaudière and the Little Chaudière dams to Lake Nipissing; the west bay of Lake Nipissing in Haddo Twp.; the northwest bay of Lake Nipissing to the falls of MacPherson Creek; the Sturgeon River from Lake Nipissing to the dam at Sturgeon Falls; the Veuve River from Lake Nipissing to the chutes located in Lot 5 in Conc. l in Caldwell Twp.; the South River from Lake Nipissing to Hwy. 654; and the entire West Arm of Lake Nipissing including Cross Lake.

Yellow perch S - 25 in one day, possession limit of 50."
452591,Jonny,2010-04-06 15:14:00,1380,"Well, yes, but Bear Creek, Laronde, Little Sturgeon, Duchesnay, as well as almost countless small creeks and inflows? In normal years the smelts have been coming up inflows so small that you can step across them and that hardly give you enough room to get a dip net into!"
452628,brifishrgy,2010-04-06 16:42:00,559,  if it isn't listed it isn't a sanctuary
452655,Dara,2010-04-06 17:47:00,3052,Latest report in the Sault. They were running solid at 10 am this morning north of town. get em while they last...tonight may be too late
452691,Muskieman,2010-04-06 19:06:00,2472,"  I just got back from speaking with my local C/O's Even if it's not listed it may be a sanctuary.  They quickly pointed out page 1 of the 2010 regs. top right hand corner ""Important Notice"" "" This is a summary of information dealing with fishing licenses and fishing laws.This summary is neither a legal document nor a complete collection of the current regulations. It is meant to be a convenient reference only"".  I asked them about Laronde Creek and the Little Sturgeon River. They told me that all tributaries on the North shore of Nipissing are a sanctuary up to Hwy 17 or the nearest elevation ie Rapid or Dam or unless otherwise posted in the Exceptions.  Randy "
452698,brifishrgy,2010-04-06 19:20:00,559, I would hope they have it clearly posted
452712,BucktownAngler,2010-04-06 19:45:00,582,anywhere in southern ontario? simcoe? lake ontario?
452721,Dara,2010-04-06 20:23:00,3052,  so you can't even fish for invasive species....they get you coming and going
452727,Jonny,2010-04-06 20:53:00,1380," Thanks for the information. But during the smelt run, nobody, and I mean nobody, seems to either know this or pay attention to it. And I've never heard of a CO interfering with smelt fishing.    I haven't seen a sign like that posted anywhere (of the places I go). It seems to me that for this whole issue they're expecting people to know things that aren't properly publicized. That may also be why there doesn't seem to be any enforcement, for smelt fishing anyway.  The whole thing about how they handle the Nipissing fishery in the spring ticks me off anyhow. They're too lazy to enforce season closures for the major species (pickerel, pike, bass) so they close the whole lake for EVERYTHING. You can't even fish white bass and other non-game species before the Victoria Day weekend. Apparently that includes smelts in the creeks? What a crock!"
452740,pike slayer,2010-04-06 21:20:00,1177,"the smelts are starting to heat up here around the sault area, gonna be hot later in the week and into the weekend!!"
452741,camillj,2010-04-06 21:26:00,1988,Laker bait ?
452820,Dara,2010-04-06 23:47:00,3052,   Like on Top Gun...the weekend?  this things gonna be over by wednesday.  The weekend may be too late by the way they were running this morning
452837,BillM,2010-04-07 00:23:00,17367,"I just want 2-3 dozen for early season pike fishing, lol."
452839,Dara,2010-04-07 00:25:00,3052,I want them for whitefish
452842,brifishrgy,2010-04-07 00:27:00,559,I feed them to my piranha
452891,Jonny,2010-04-07 02:21:00,1380,"   Yeah, and down in Florida they use shrimps for bait. Poor misguided souls."
