452634,Uncle Buck,2010-04-06 17:01:00,1000,Picked up an 87 Suzuki DT20 outboard a while back  having issues with the carb... it's a mikuni carb  anyone have any ideas? getting too much fuel and it's flooding the plugs and it won't idle  motor has good compression
452640,fishhawk7,2010-04-06 17:10:00,7,"With the Mikuni carb it sounds like you have some varnish build up from fuel that has sat in the bowl, the best thing to do is remove the carb and strip it down and find out if the needle has stuck open in the seat or if the float has stuck or is no longer boyant. soak the carb in carb cleaner, blow it out with compressed air and re-assemble, pay attention to the small ports and make sure they are free of blockages. If it floods only when  under power you may have a reed valve issue or check the engines compression. I hope this helps."

452894,HTHM,2010-04-07 02:23:00,4082,"I agree, perhaps pulling the carb and soaking it overnight or a day or two in carb cleaner will help."
452922,Sinker,2010-04-07 03:27:00,8692,"Like I said on the other site, SEAFOAM it!! I'm tellin ya, the stuff will clean the whole fuel system. Put a full can in a tank of gas and let 'er smoke!! Get it at NAPA dealers!!  If that doesn't work, hit it with a hammer  S."
