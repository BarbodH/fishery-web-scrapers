451898,scuro2,2010-04-05 02:37:00,904,I have a lot of silver and brass plated spoons. Some are older and tarnished. Anyway to get that new look back again? I'm afraid too much polishing may take off the silver plate.
451899,irishfield,2010-04-05 02:38:00,26272,Can of Braso or Silvo should clean them up with a bit of rubbing.
451908,The JAY,2010-04-05 02:49:00,239,"Yup, use a toothbrush, or if they're really bad some 0000 steel wool. Autosol or Mother's chrome polish will work too."
451913,scuro2,2010-04-05 02:53:00,904,I'm just thinking about the silver plating. Could you not be potentially taking off the plating or thinning it? How many times can you do this before the silver plating is ruined?
451993,BITEME,2010-04-05 11:31:00,1968,  That would mean extra work

452007,splashhopper,2010-04-05 12:56:00,2931," I used to manage a bar that had brass rails all around the windows.  Every day for the three years that I was there, those rails were rubbed down with Brasso.  They always looked GREAT in the morning. Just like the day they were installed.  I am pretty sure you won;t be rubbing your lures down daily for three years...  give it a try.."
452009,Roy,2010-04-05 13:09:00,13728,"Yes you will wear through the thin plating of silver, gold or whatever eventually. If you still want to keep those baits, I'd suggest properly applied, good quality powder paints in the colour(s) of your choice. At least that's what I'd do with them."
452026,scuro2,2010-04-05 13:54:00,904,Is there an easy way to reapply a silver finish?
452133,SBCregal,2010-04-05 18:06:00,688,you COULD get it replated.  dont know how that would compare to the cost of a new spoon though.
452154,JEREMY,2010-04-05 18:49:00,300,I just had the same problem.I took a dremel to them took all the paint off took out the model paint and gave them to the kids to play with.
