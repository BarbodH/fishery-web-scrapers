I loaded up the yak, tied on a pink Xrap, and started paddling toward a couple of islands. About 40' out, I figure out that my bail is open and the Xrap is still on shore. I reel in, pleasantly surprised that I don't snag on shore and start to paddle....bent rod. ""Crap"" I think, I'm snagged on the bottom. Nope, I'm snagged on a feisty, 16"" smallie that hit in 4' of water. I bring it in, release it quickly and think ""That is very strange, what are the odds?"" Pretty high, apparently. Over the next 1.5 hrs I caught 6 smallies, all in less than 10' of water, all fighting and quite active.  Local ""wisdom"" says that the smallies will still be lurking in deep holes, waiting for the water to warm up. Has this happened to anyone else?"

452303,Rizzo,2010-04-06 00:40:00,4754,I see the smallies regularly cruising the shallows after ice out at our cottage
452376,Jigger,2010-04-06 01:50:00,1237,Ive had plenty of smallies hit lures in shallow water after iceout.
452379,ciceri,2010-04-06 01:54:00,535,Makes sense to me. Maybe if it was July/August it'd be weird. I think it'd be stranger to catch Lake Trout in 4-10 feet of water.
452456,uglyfish,2010-04-06 03:54:00,981,common misconception that bass hide in deep water in the winter. some bass with stay shallow all through the year even under ice. seen lots of bass on the camera this winter fishing a bay with 4-5' of water. and there is water 20' deep only 100 yards away and much deeper water then that not much farther.
