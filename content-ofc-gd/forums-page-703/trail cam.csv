452316,Jewelbee,2010-04-06 00:49:00,422,"Ever been walking through the woods at night and had the sensation that something was following.......  It appears the deer does not even know it's behind him.  This picture is from   the Peterborough area, where   someone set out a   motion sensor camera to see if any big bucks were passing in the area. It's a one in a million shot!    WOW!!!  scary to see such a big    cat .   PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WE DO HAVE COUGARS   IN ONTARIO  "
452318,cwpowell,2010-04-06 00:52:00,265,"Wow, thats insane. How do you know where the picture was taken?"
452319,irishfield,2010-04-06 00:53:00,26272,Wait 'till Rick comes home and sees that !! lol
452320,Jewelbee,2010-04-06 00:54:00,422,Just word of mouth so......
452324,cwpowell,2010-04-06 00:57:00,265,"Wow, well wherever it is, pretty amazing shot! Good find."
452332,Daplumma,2010-04-06 01:03:00,1961,Cougars in Ontario??I know for a fact there are some in the GTA.Great pic though. Joe
452333,Jewelbee,2010-04-06 01:06:00,422,LOL!!!! No Doubt in my mind
452334,Daplumma,2010-04-06 01:07:00,1961,"That same pic is also claimed to be in Georgia and Oregon,kinda like that really big pike pic or two headed pike.Its still and awesome pic. Joe"
452528,Court R,2010-04-06 13:19:00,213,"That pic has been around for years..and that is a mule deer and they aren't in Ontario..also look at the srub, that looks like out west, plus it has been photoshopped, look at the date where it is over lapped."
452529,Bigworm,2010-04-06 13:19:00,119,"That picture is a fake and it is certainly not from Ontario. First,that deer isn't a Whitetail and that is all we have here. Second, a cougar would never get that close to a deer without it sensing it.  Mark"
452549,skeeter,2010-04-06 13:47:00,1907,"well fake or not. ontario or not.  i dont want to be the poor bugger that finds out first hand that you guys are WRONG. the only good part about that is, that i can out run TRACKER~~~~~"
452551,MooseMerch,2010-04-06 13:55:00,68,Yup I had that emailed to me and said it was up barrie way
452567,fishing n autograph,2010-04-06 14:20:00,2540,That is an amazing capture!!  I know they are in the GTA. I saw one a year and a half ago at Keele Street and King Road in King City at about 2 AM.....

452768,Jewelbee,2010-04-06 22:24:00,422,"Your right about the deer..it is a muley. Can't believe I didn't notice. This was sent to me and I just thought it would be fun to post and see what you guys had to say. The best comment by far is the ""Cougars in Toronto"" comment. Love you guys...made me LOL!!!!!!! Jewelbee"
452770,bassman87,2010-04-06 22:27:00,586,I'm pretty sure it's an atlantic
452798,Mattones,2010-04-06 23:18:00,587,Not from Canada. Been around for years hehe.
452814,BillM,2010-04-06 23:39:00,17367,I heard this was shot in downtown Toronto  :)  
452833,troutboy,2010-04-07 00:20:00,125,"This was not taken in ontario because if you look at the tail of the deer...its a MULE DEER,we dont have mule deer in ontario.But I know for a fact theres cougars in NWO,they are attacking dogs intown,Ive seen 3 down a bush road coming back from fishin'.
