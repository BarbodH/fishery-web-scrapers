452767,darsky,2010-04-06 22:17:00,586,was fishing a local canal today and was face to face with hundreds of panfish. Dropped minnows-no takers. Then I dangled juicy worms millimeters from their mouths-no dice either.Never seen this before. Weird.

452806,jat,2010-04-06 23:28:00,138,"in that case you need to down size your line, bait and keep switching it up until they hit....try using tiny jigs with a small profile white/pink/chartreuse plastic grub or if that doesn't work usually tiny flies work well....and if that still doesn't cut it then move up in size and use small crankbaits,spinners......"
