Apparently the north end of the river stretching from Scugog to Sturgeon(North of the Locks in Lindsay) is classified as the Sturgeon river and is open for fishing(not a sanctuary until May like the Scugog). I see the exception about the scugog river so am I in the clear to fish above the locks towards Sturgeon Lake?  Would like to do some panfishing and possibly carp from shore.  Thanks MTBF"
452592,GBW,2010-04-06 15:14:00,8460,"Watch out Mike. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001336.pdf Look on pg 3. No fishing there right now... page 3 of the pdf says ""Scugog River (Lindsay) - Ops Twp., from Trent-Severn Dam to Ops-Fenelon boundary"" but you can call the MNR too. Your best bet is to call the MNR Info Line at 1-800-667-1940 the MNR say that ""The OPS/Fenelon boundary is in a line with Pickeral Point road, across the water to Ken Reid rd."""
452605,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-06 15:50:00,3761,Member who gave me the info is not going to be mentioned...i never saw the others but boats were there fishing apparently
452607,fish-miester,2010-04-06 15:58:00,864, Hey Mike the ops boundary aka Pickeral Point Rd / Ken Reid Rd is located at the bottom of sturgeon Lake. as well I have talked to Kawartha B&T and they said that the locks and towards sturgeon is closed till walleye opener. and that from the locks towards Scugog its open to fish. I have also seen quite a few people fishing the scugog side already
452732,ciceri,2010-04-06 21:08:00,535,"Sturgeon is below the locks as well.. And the actual fish sanctuary is below the locks.. go there now and you'll see hundreds/thousands of walleye, suckers, perch, odd musky, carp."
452737,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-06 21:18:00,3761,So...is it legal to fish up current to the locks?
452752,GBW,2010-04-06 21:50:00,8460,"The way I read the reg's Mike, NO."
452939,MJIG,2010-04-07 05:15:00,227," Hi Mike, Just so nobody gets confused from your statement ""above the locks towards Sturgeon Lake""... The high-water side of the Lindsay dam/locks leads to Scugog Lake, and the low-water side of the locks leads to Sturgeon Lake. The water flow is from Scugog downstream, over the dam, and into Sturgeon. You cannot fish between the dam and Sturgeon Lake until Walleye opens."
452941,Sinker,2010-04-07 05:24:00,8692," This is correct.  The water flows from scugog to sturgeon. The downstream side of the lock is the sanctuary......towards sturgeon lake. The upstream side is open for fishing.  The OPS boundary is kinda tricky, be careful with that one. I've called the MNR, and even they couldn't tell me exactly where it was on the water. Fish-meister is correct in saying its the line from Ken ried rd, to pickeral point rd.....but theres quite the span of water between there. They should post signs in there so people know where they're at. A lot of the locals use the pillars as the boundary, but I""m sure thats still technically inside the sanctuary. The boats are stacked in there on walleye opener.  S."
452975,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-07 12:15:00,3761,Thanks for clearing that up for me guys. Really appreciate it. Looks like I'm going fishing today
