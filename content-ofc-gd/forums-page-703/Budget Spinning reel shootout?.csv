452315,jedimaster,2010-04-06 00:49:00,3472,"Ok, so whats your pick for a front drag 2500ish front drag spinning reel? Need another reel and would like to try something new.

452321,cwpowell,2010-04-06 00:55:00,265,"Hey dude, I picked up the Shimano Sonora at the Sportsman show for $45 bucks and I couldn't be happier, smooth baby smooth!  Here are the specs  5:2:1 Ratio 8/140 $45"
452327,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-06 00:58:00,4399," I have four Sedona`s so I guess you know how I voted, I belive there is a 20 dollar mail in rebate now."
452352,Radnine,2010-04-06 01:24:00,1538,I have four Daiwa Excelers. Two of the 2500's and two 1500's. They have performed flawlessly so far and I would buy another in a heart beat. I have not tried any others so I can't offer a comparison. I got lucky with my first choice and didn't go anywhere else. Jim
452357,jedimaster,2010-04-06 01:30:00,3472,"I also have a sonora I think its a great reel as well. I have various sonora, stradic, symetre, sahara, curados, abu's etc... just looking for a new reel to match up with an all purpose rod, skipping docks, etc... So I thought I would try something else."
452358,fishindude,2010-04-06 01:30:00,220,"Sedona 2500FD here, no problems with it, very smooth drag and casts really well. For the extra $20 or so, I would spend the money on the Sahara as it has more metal parts although the Daiwa would be a good choice too."
452363,Syn,2010-04-06 01:33:00,519,Didn't we have this exact same thread a week or two ago and then started taking about which comes with a free spare spool or am I high? Some of those responses look eerily familiar.
452374,scugpg,2010-04-06 01:48:00,1373,"I've used a Sedona, Exceler and a President and the Pfluger tops them all."
452404,hawk-eye,2010-04-06 02:21:00,141,Ive had a Sedona 4000 for a few years and it works great. I mainly use it drifting for steelhead in Niagara
452405,backbay,2010-04-06 02:23:00,773,"I have a President and a Trion, both good value."
452408,jedimaster,2010-04-06 02:25:00,3472,"I think all but the sedona come with a spare spool, I missed the last thread."
452411,bigugli,2010-04-06 02:28:00,6138,I've got a President that has survived 4 years of my abuse. It's a great reel for the price.
452424,Syn,2010-04-06 02:52:00,519,   I think I found the thread in case you want more opinions shimano sedona vs daiwa regal XiA   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41225&st=20&p=440217&hl=spinning%20reel&fromsearch=1entry440217
452443,solopaddler,2010-04-06 03:25:00,8605,Pfleuger hands down. In that price range it's by far the best reel out there. It's actually a better reel than many that are much more expensive.
452446,PERCHER,2010-04-06 03:27:00,787,I have to Sedona rear Drags .Great reels.You can pick them up for 59.00.
452448,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-06 03:32:00,0,i like the abu's best but i have no complaints about pfluegers minus that i had a nice smallie pull it out of the boat.
452451,uglyfish,2010-04-06 03:44:00,981,the quantum incyte is a nice reel. very smooth and looks far better then the rest of the reels u mentioned.
452645,jedimaster,2010-04-06 17:34:00,3472,"The quantum looks cool, I was gonna try it out for the looks. I guess I'll have to go down and check em out first hand.  I think the spinning reels in the 50 - 70 dollar range have really improved in quality. I can feel the difference between my stradics and the other cheaper ones but its not like it used to be."
452649,backbay,2010-04-06 17:40:00,773,"BTW, Jedi, I haven't bought one yet, but am going to check out the Pflueger Arbor. Same price range, about $75-$80, and braid-specific. Might be a good alternative for you. Arbor"
452656,Uncle Buck,2010-04-06 17:49:00,1000,"don't own any of the above reels, but i have 4 quantum icon 20 spinning reels, great reels, great drags, great price plus magnetic bail... i've been using them for almost 7 years and no issues, never serviced any of them either...  i use them year round, in the winter i put them on all my ice rods... just buy spare spools....  if i was looking at a new reel, it would be a quantum hands down!"
