452239,ciceri,2010-04-05 22:25:00,535,"Well, being the facebook creeper I am, I came across this picture that someone took of a fish. I look at it, and the head screams Pike, and it also looks like there are very distinctive circles on its side, but I am not 100% and it's hard to tell as I was not there. Now, I beleive these pictures were taken at Ken Reid park, meaning the water is Sturgeon Lake waters, very close to the Scugog River. "
452246,pike slayer,2010-04-05 22:34:00,1177,looks like a pike to me
452249,Syn,2010-04-05 22:36:00,519,platypus.  For some reason I'd bet on pike but its so hard to tell.  Saw this the other day http://muskie.outdoo...tch.asp?id=2282
452253,4thgen,2010-04-05 22:45:00,157,"Really hard to say for sure but there isn't really anything that would make me think it's a pike moreso than a musky. On the other hand, both the body of water and the forked, pointed tail side with musky.  I'm going with musky.  Edit: Also, I've seen numerous musky sitting like that in flowing water, especially during the spring."
452256,ciceri,2010-04-05 22:58:00,535,"It looks kinda beat up, making it harder to tell.. Just found out it was in Ken Reid for sure."
452258,bare foot wader,2010-04-05 23:01:00,1354,"I'm going with musky....sides look pretty light, looks like dark pattern on lighter body....I've seen quite a few muskies sunning themselves like that, not so much with pike"
452304,ciceri,2010-04-06 00:40:00,535, Ya I've seen many Musky sunning in the river like that.
452314,Rizzo,2010-04-06 00:49:00,4754,"not enough contrast on the sides. I think the light spots on the dark sides of a pike would be more visible if that was a pike. I have caught muskies that have very little markings so here's a vote for musky. To me, pike always look pretty much the same (except those blue or albino freaks)but muskies can have a broad range of appearance from striped to spotted to green to silver..."
452329,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-06 01:00:00,3761,"Cool video of the fish in the current, my vote is Muskie for the photo Ryan."

452370,ciceri,2010-04-06 01:44:00,535,"I still see a Pike head when I look at it.. And ya, that video is siiiick, huge fish. I see now that what I though were marking is the sun shining on its side, lol.   Looks like a young fish"

452394,gone_fishin,2010-04-06 02:07:00,481,"tail looks forked to me... although it's hard to tell, my money is still on musky."
452399,hawk-eye,2010-04-06 02:09:00,141,"Hard to tell but the colour of the body seems to be to dark to be a muskie, Im goin with pike"
452457,Jonny,2010-04-06 03:55:00,1380,Come on guys - admit it - the pic isn't good enough to be able to tell.
452536,phatfish,2010-04-06 13:25:00,7,there has been a few pike caught out of scoug the last couple years and the ministry has then for research.  good chance it is a pike as they could work there way through the trent sevren....

452861,Sinker,2010-04-07 00:47:00,8692,"I'd say its a musky.  Judging by where it was taken, I sure as hell hope it is a musky, and not a pike. I've spent a lot of years on sturgeon, and never seen or heard of one out of there YET. You never know I guess....  S."
