450779,justin elia,2010-04-01 17:16:00,151,I think yesterday was the 4th time we've tried to hook up and I havent been able to join on any occasion.  And everytime you hit the nail on the head......Fantastic work!
450781,Roy,2010-04-01 17:19:00,13728,Wow!! I hadn't read that properly. So that was in Ontario? Did they make you buy a non-resident license Mike? I know I have to....  Good job guys.
450783,solopaddler,2010-04-01 17:19:00,8605,"  I'm familiar with the term as is Dave. In Ontario you're constantly get low holed. As well as high holed, sidesway holed and corn holed.  You learn to live with it on our busy trib's or you look elsewhere for more peace.  Regardless, Dave is a friend and he's welcome to fish out of my back pocket anytime he wants to."
450784,anders,2010-04-01 17:26:00,1168,Solid fish...thank for posting
450785,solopaddler,2010-04-01 17:34:00,8605," Next time for sure buddy!    Shocking isn't it Roy?   I never really responded properly in the other thread, but this is a good opportunity.  I currently have 5 licenses in my pouch for steelhead fishing: Ontario, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  I fish for them everywhere....wherever I think my best odds are. Variety is the spice of life and personally I feel privelaged to be able to fish all the waters that the great lakes has to offer.  I feel sorry for those of you, who for whatever reason, look down on stateside fishing.  First and foremost Ontario doesn't have exclusive rights to so called ""superior"" wild fish. If you don't believe me travel to Michigan, you'll be blown away. As well while some of the other states support what's basically an artificial fishery...in many cases the experience to be had is second to none. There's not many places in southern Ontario where you can walk miles of river and not see another soul all day in an absolutely pristine wild setting. The many fish that are put on the bank are nothing more than a huge bonus.  I could go on and on..."
450788,Harv,2010-04-01 18:00:00,19,"Well said Mike!!  Kudos on another stellar day on the river.  And I am with you 100% regarding the Riverkeeper - quality reels, quality guy!!!  I am not so sure about letting that Wallace dude fish out of your back pocket though...   cheers  Harv"
450790,mattyk,2010-04-01 18:28:00,2110,"great report, thanks for sharing!"
450794,solopaddler,2010-04-01 18:38:00,8605, Ironically enough I think Dave fits into my back pocket. Literally.  
450809,wallacio,2010-04-01 19:27:00,475," Geeze, I go away for a few hours and my name is getting dragged through the mud!  For the record I was fishing well upstream from Mike!"
450814,solopaddler,2010-04-01 20:01:00,8605,  Exactly! You were high holing me you little grease monkey!     
450817,lew,2010-04-01 20:15:00,12766,I'm not into river fishing at all Mike but I've always enjoyed reading your tales and your pictures are excellent too !!  Really good stuff.
450827,BillM,2010-04-01 21:20:00,17367,"Friggin Dave, greasing people out!!!!!  Tomorrow morning is going to come awful early."
450830,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-01 21:31:00,2690,"Nice fish, haven't had time to read all the replies...definitely not the states  has anyone given you crap for revealing the location via photo yet???? I prefer to fish there in the late fall, early winter, but, some good fishing to be had still at this time of year. Wish I could swing the days off!"
450843,BrownTown,2010-04-01 22:14:00,103,"Nice work, Robb is a class act for sure. Atleast you guys were drinking the good stuff. I love creemore springs!"
450860,highdrifter,2010-04-02 00:04:00,2534,Shwweeeeet!!  Am I having a little deja-vu here?!
450867,trevy727,2010-04-02 00:18:00,351,i love that river. One of my favourites
450899,NAC,2010-04-02 02:04:00,369,"  wasn't directing that at you folks more just a general statement with it being that time of year, and already having had the pleasurable experience."
451858,Paulus,2010-04-05 01:39:00,522,"Sweet! Nothing like those northern chromers! It's nice to see that you got into some of them with flies, too. Bonus!  p.-"
451859,Paulus,2010-04-05 01:40:00,522, Corn holed LOL!  p.-
452039,ehg,2010-04-05 14:14:00,2666,LMAO at that statement!  Another great report Mike  Attawapiskat shoulde be epic
452057,Paulus,2010-04-05 14:55:00,522,"Oh, hey Mike.  Was that highly animated, super friendly, incredibly magnanimous guy from ""Team Nissan"" there? What a conversation we had with him, last fall! Or did he move? I think he might be permanently residing in Aruba or someplace.  Anyway, maybe he was visiting and you saw him... just wondering...  I feel a cold coming. Not sure if I can make it to work...  p.-"
452168,MJL,2010-04-05 19:31:00,2427,"Big water, chrome fish, nice weather, sharing some drifts with  friends...Can't think of a better way to spend a day.  Simply beautiful Mike.  Thanks for sharing your adventure with us.  Now if only the Frogwaters came in 4.5 inches and in jet black..."
452186,sconceptor,2010-04-05 20:11:00,146,"Good job, Good post!"
450713,solopaddler,2010-04-01 14:44:00,8605,"Rumours of a fresh run of fish on a north Huron tributary had me scrambling to get my shift covered on Wednesday. I worked 2pm Tuesday 'till 5am Wed morning and with gear already packed in the car I left straight from work bleary eyed with coffee in hand.  I had asked a couple of friends to join, but getting a day off midweek is difficult for most. As it turned out I ran into several friends up there anyway. When there's a hot bite word spreads.  Arriving in the parking lot around 8 there were already a lot of cars there. Undaunted I rigged up and made my way to the river. Immediately I ran into my friend Dave (Wallacio on the board). He had just blown a hot fish and seemed pumped. I slipped downstream to find some room and ran into Robb Marquette and a friend of his. Robb makes the Riverkeeper/Frogwater float reels which I'm currently fishing. As it turned out Robb's presence was a very happy coincidence for me as you'll see later..  Rumours were bang on and after slipping downstream into a favoured zone I hit a number of bright acrobatic steelhead.           Robb took this shot for me, he was a little wobbly with the camera.     Robb and his buddy both hooked into a couple of fish just downstream from me as well:     Seeing the action, Dave, wiley dog that he is, slipped downstream and was soon into one as well:        While we were fishing a massive hatch of stoneflies started. They were fluttering everywhere, landing on our necks and arms and generally being a pita.  Dave quickly saw an opportunity and switched from roe to a black stone. Success was immediate:      Dave hit a couple more fish before he had to leave for a work related meeting. Before going he kindly handed me one of his magic flies     Thanks buddy!              I had mentioned to Robb that my reel wasn't quite as smooth as it should be. Worn out from overuse was my excuse   .  At the end of the day in the parking lot he asked if he could have a look at it. In short order he disassembled it, cleaned it, removed my old bearings and replaced them with two new ones.    Sweet!  Robb is a great guy to deal with folks. The fact that he makes his reels right here in Ontario in small batches 100% by hand makes them a good choice for anyone who's in the market.  Obviously it was a day to remember. Perfect weather, chrome bright fish and good friends. It just doesn't get any better.  Cheers,  Mike"
450714,bassman87,2010-04-01 14:49:00,586,AWESOMEEEE NICE
450715,The Urban Fisherman,2010-04-01 14:54:00,2050," You forgot to mention the tailgate beers Mike! haha  great report! Thanks!  cheers, Ryan"

450717,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-01 14:57:00,0,sweet report!  better make sure i've got some stonefly nymphs tucked away in my box! lol let's hope the troutologist and i can get a few this weekend!
450718,vinnimon,2010-04-01 14:57:00,2593,nice mike
450719,solopaddler,2010-04-01 14:58:00,8605, You can work up a mighty thirst fishing in the blazing hot sun all day.  Looking forward to getting out with you later this month bud.
450720,solopaddler,2010-04-01 15:00:00,8605,"  Yeah for sure, I never fish in Ontario.  (Well actually truth be told I avoid the eastern ditches like the plague. I prefer to fish actual rivers.)"
450723,fishnsled,2010-04-01 15:07:00,3520,"A great day on the water with some good friends, very tough to beat."
450724,bassman87,2010-04-01 15:07:00,586,cool stuff good job
450728,msp,2010-04-01 15:17:00,1336,"now now, settle down. no need to be-little the eastern tribs......... a steelhead is a steelhead"
450729,discophish,2010-04-01 15:20:00,392,"Awesome report!  That coffee you drank must have been as thick as syrup to keep you up on the drive.  Does Robb work on brains too?  Mine hasn't been running as smooth as it should.  I think it's just a cobweb problem, and not the bearings.  Good job on the river!"
450733,fish_finder,2010-04-01 15:26:00,370,Nice man!  Any way you might be able to post a clearer shot of that fly.....looks like a dandy!
450738,solopaddler,2010-04-01 15:39:00,8605," Maybe, but if someone takes an unwarranted shot at me I tend to respond."
450739,wallacio,2010-04-01 15:40:00,475,"It was good to see you again Mike - yesterday was definitely the highlight of my Spring Steelhead season.   It really, really tough to tear myself away for that meeting!  Something tells me that tackle/fly shops in the province are soon going to be sold out of Stonefly numphs  As for the pattern, I was using a couple different ones.   The one with the copper wire rib is a small Montana Stone pattern.   The larger one is a standard pattern that's available at most shops (known as Kaufmann's Stonefly nymph - just Google it.).   Bead head, rubber legs, turkey quill wingcases)."

450760,solopaddler,2010-04-01 16:32:00,8605, By 4:30 I was getting loopy from lack of sleep. No co-ordination...stumbling around tripping over everything from exhaustion LOL!  Totally worth it though.
450762,Spiel,2010-04-01 16:33:00,9065, I'm sure you had a good nap while driving home. 
450763,rock34,2010-04-01 16:34:00,215,"Mike, Do you ever miss a fresh run?  As usual I more then impressed with your report."
450764,TC1OZ,2010-04-01 16:35:00,987,Nice fishing! Looks like an amazing day! Is that creemore springs?
450765,solopaddler,2010-04-01 16:38:00,8605,"  You have a keen eye, indeed it is.  One of my favourites. "

I'll leave the beers for you."
