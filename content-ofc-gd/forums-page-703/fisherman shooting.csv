Why should anyone have to put up a $2.00 sign to keep your creepy asses out of private property, it's not yours, keep the hell out. Maybe he should come into your house when you're not around and help himself to everything in the fridge and bedroom.  You'd be the first to Pizz and Moan that someone trespassed and used your stuff, maybe you should have to put up a $2.00 sign too."

And if this landowner had previous issues (none of which have been mentioned) one would think he would have been PROACTIVE in letting the general public know where his property line was.

203047,Carp,2008-05-18 16:43:00,1488,"If this property has been trespassed on before (by the sounds of it, numerous times by various anglers), I find it hard to believe the owner didn't have the property posted. There's only so many times a person can stand hearing the same excuses. ""Didn't see any signs."" ""Thought it was public land."" Oooops! Sorry.  If the property was posted, which I would tend to believe it was, the signs were probably torn down by poachers/trespassers to support their feeble excuses.  Although I don't agree with shooting the trespassers, the owner doesn't know how mentally stable these people are. It would be unwise to confront someone without a viable means of defense. Seems like laws here in Canada protect criminals more than victims.  This case should serve as a warning those who trespass & steal.  The owner should have stayed out of sight any called police immediately. The pair could have been charged with theft/poaching and trespassing. That alone would probably be enough to keep them from visiting the pond again."
203054,wacky tambaqui,2008-05-18 17:51:00,33,"So...  Here we have something about somebody going into someone else's private pond which isn't right to begin with but OTOH was the property clealy fenced and signed as being private land?  Was the place all wide open and looking like a free-for-all or were there blatant visual indications such as fences and signs? If it was visually obvious that the property is private-owned, then in this case I side with the property owner. That being said, I too would pack some rock salt loads.  In another incident some years ago I was looking for a way into a rapids on the Wanapitei River and found what looked like an access point. There was a widening in the road and tire marks that suggested other anglers and berry pickers were parking there. There were no signs, fences, or any visual indication the land was off-limits to the public. Otherwise I would have not ventured there.  As I took my tackle out of the trunk, I was startled with loud growling noises. I turned and there were Cujo and Chopper backing me up against the car, baring their fangs. I've been face to face with every four-legged Northern Ontario critter you could name except the cougar and never felt afraid or saw any need to pack pepper spray until that encounter with those two vicious dogs.  Then the land owner came around with an attitude to match that of his psycho mutts. To make a long story short I cut the argument short by retorting: ""Sir, I did not mean to intrude on you like this. I didn't know this was your place.""  On those words, the land owner just blanched as white as a bed sheet from head to toe and completely changed his tune from a condescending one to a convivial one and even extended a handshake. To this day I regret having accepted such a truce with Mr. Psycho Mutts. But then too, I was all startled, surprised, shaken, and not thinking clearly anyway.  In Ontario, any open countryside is a free-for-all unless clearly marked and signed as being private-owned. I speak from my many years of experience working in legal land surveys."
203090,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-18 20:57:00,835,"I'm sorry I lumped all the cops together. Cops HERE will NOT come to a trespass complaint unless you have the bad guys  or plate #'s and I don't blame them because they can't do anything after their long gone anyway.  How  do you pull someone over if you don't chase them? no wonder you got so many speeders up there. The cops here will chase you and pull you over for speeding, seat belts, and all kinds of stuff. Maybe your definition of ""chase"" is a little different than mine.  In any case stop beating your head on the wall, it aint worth it."
203232,fishing n autograph,2008-05-19 11:01:00,2540, our idea of chase is a little different. Chase for me means High Speed Pursuit. Of course you have to speed up from a parked position to stop someone who goes speeding past you.

203307,Baldy,2008-05-19 17:01:00,44,"Funny, I understood that if you want to access private property either to hunt or fish you must get permission from the landowner.  This is excerpts from the MNR website regarding access to private property:   ""When it comes to crossing private lands to access fishing opportunities the property occupier has the first and last word about who can enter the property. It is up to the occupier to allow or restrict entry onto their property or to allow or restrict the activities that occur on that property.  In general terms anyone may enter onto private property to do anything which is lawful without occupier permission unless the entrant has been given notice that entry is prohibited. So, a privately owned bush lot is available to the general public until the occupier notifies people otherwise. The occupier has a number of options when it comes to letting people know that entry is prohibited or that activities are restricted.  Another common method of notice is coloured markings. You will often see red or yellow dots painted on trees or fence posts on a property boundary. A red coloured marker indicates that the occupier is restricting all access; entry is prohibited.  There is a long list of other things which are forms of notice and must be considered the occupiers intention to restrict entry on property. This list includes:  * Maintained fences and gates; * Land under cultivation; * Orchards; * Planted trees under 2 metres in height; and * Established lawns and gardens  When it comes to signs, coloured markings and fences (gates) the occupier is only required to place them at the normal access point to the property. Generally that will be a laneway, private roadway or trail. There might only be one sign prohibiting entry on a very large, undeveloped woodlot for example. It is the responsibility of the entrant to determine whether or not the occupier intends to restrict access to the property and where the property boundaries are; the occupier is not responsible for marking the entire property boundary.""  Seems pretty clear that these 'fisherman' knew what they were doing.  They didn't deserve to be shot at but it could have been worse, could be on the missing persons list.  Why take the chance, doing something illegal, when you are unsure of the consequences.  Gives us all a bad name!"
203579,Stern Rules,2008-05-20 05:19:00,342,Tough call on this one. Fishing in someone's pond is inconsiderate. There are millions of other spots to catch fish but to shoot at someone for that is a bit extreme. If it was salt that's a bit different but still harsh. But if they were there many times before they deserved something. It definately does give fishermen a bad rap. Not all of us are rude and inconsiderate. Maybe he should hook up a good electrified fence.
203581,Musky or Specks,2008-05-20 06:01:00,2710,The no trespassing sign Ive always wanted is a Human Target silouette with a big red circle with a slash through it. Pinned to a tree and peppered with buckshot. If you didnt get the meaning to that youd be pretty thick.

I saw the wounds suffered by the two guys fishing... sure looked like puncture wounds to me! I saw no scratches whatso ever... which is what you would expect running through the bush, not obvious ""pellet wounds"" that penetrated their waders, On the BACK of the waders I might add... meaning they were running away and were no threat.  I think the landowner is wrong here, and should receive what ever justice the judge seems him to be deserving of.   I should add he is now claiming he shot into the air... to scare them.

The Ontario Provincial Police, County of Brant Detachment are investigating a shooting of two men who were fishing in a land owner’s pond on the 13th of May 2008 at 6:50 P.M. The two victims were fishing at Whitemans Creek when they ventured to a private pond. The two victims were fishing in the pond when the landowner confronted them with a shotgun. The two victims turned and started to run away when the land owner shot them. One of the victims continued to run into a bush area but the second victim fell to the ground. The landowner reloaded the gun and kept it pointed at the victim lying on the ground. The second victim returned and was physically assaulted by the landowner. The two victims then fled the scene and contacted the police.   The two victims were checked by County of Brant Paramedics and neither needed to attend the hospital.

Then said that we were dumb for picking the cherries from the perimeter trees as they were sour anyhow and were for baking pies.  Kids will eat anything though and I loved sour stuff like lemons and green unripe grapes and apples.  When my brother was a kid he got a shotgun full of rock salt in the butt for stealing corn, he like myself, never trespassed onto a farmers field again. Lesson learned.  All that said, yes he the ""owner"" should give in and post it as private property. A warning shot over the head would be a better idea than filling the guys with shot. Crap!
