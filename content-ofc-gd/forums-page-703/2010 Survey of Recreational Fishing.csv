452586,diggyj,2010-04-06 15:07:00,548,I am wondering if anyone participated in the 2005 Survey of Recreational Fishing as there is one taking place this year in 2010 with the results starting to be tabulated in 2011. How does one get picked for this program or is it just a random pick done by the ministry?  I am curious about the 2005 results as they have species on there which are not found in Rice Lake. Only started fishing Rice at the end of 2008. Were they around in 2005? Or are they only being misidentified by the anglers involved in this program. I think education should be a top priority if someone cannot distiguised the difference between a trout and a musky.  Dirk 
452595,torco,2010-04-06 15:24:00,656,Hard to believe that trout would exist in Rice lake? Perhaps some small feeder creeks that are cold water were included?

452617,craigdritchie,2010-04-06 16:16:00,1586,"The survey is broken down on a watershed basis, so in the case of Rice Lake it would include tributary streams that flow into it. Many of them do have populations of brook trout and brown trout.  In answer to your original question, in order to be statistically valid the survey has to be totally random (i.e. you can't sign up to participate). The reason for this is to ensure the results are not skewed or influenced by any one group."
