452188,Abraxus,2010-04-05 20:15:00,104,"Ya...I live in Ajax now.  Remarkably close to Duffins Creek.  I walk my dog in there almost everyday now.  It is really messed up!  I walk around with a poop bag because I clean up after my dog, yet there is trash all over the place in there.  90% of the garbage comes from the guys fishing the pools!  It's pathetic!  Coffee cups, fishing line, hook packages and beer cans are perhaps the most abundant items to be found!  I wouldnt even doubt that some of the same guys that do this stuff, lurk on here once in awhile!  That area is a very cool place within the city to get a taste nature, yet morons ruin it all the time!  The worst part is, there are garbage cans in the parking lot where they park their cars! Yet they just cannot seem to carry a coke can the 5 minutes it takes to walk back to their car in order to dispose of it properly.  The thing that pisses me off most, is the fact that I am not permitted by law to have my dog off leash back there, yet these idiots can litter at will.  Just lame!  Ab"
452196,Woodsman,2010-04-05 20:27:00,1286,This is incorrect at least as far as Ontario is concerned.
452197,tb4me,2010-04-05 20:29:00,3295,"were here in Brantford. The same story all over whitemans and the grand.I have a small solution that all on here may want to try out. Take a grocery bag in with you every time you go? Make a point to fill it every time your in there.This is all we do.it doesnt stop the jerks from littering but it helps none the less.Like you say there are garbage cans 90% of the time where we park. We also have waterfront on the trent north of campbellford.. Dont even get me started on those jerks. I have to clean up the shore line every time we go out there. Im almost 100% positive most of the trash there comes from the boaters.Guys how hard is it to keep a trash bag in those boats? If your worm box blows out, use those motors and go get em. We all have to get smarter when it comes to this. Everyone should be doing thier part to keep these waterways clean."
452301,vinnimon,2010-04-06 00:37:00,2593,"Im sure there is a garbage can at the lot on clever rd.I dont know how many worm containers, beer cans, line and what ever else I find and toss in the can.But I always bring a bag.Whitemans is a beauty to fish, as well as ryerse creek in vittoria.And the carp I find there is enough to drive me nuts.Esp fishing line on the shore line and pathways."
452309,StoneFly,2010-04-06 00:45:00,574," Its got nothing to do with color, perhaps you dont fish the rivers to see what others do?"
452409,vinnimon,2010-04-06 02:25:00,2593,We do see what others do!Keep that in mind!Just my rant
452431,StoneFly,2010-04-06 03:02:00,574, Vinni...my comment was directed back at Radnine as he made his original comment about 'ignorance and colour' in reply to my original rant.  Not sure who you are speaking for when you say 'WE'...
452445,vinnimon,2010-04-06 03:26:00,2593,Ignore my reply
452447,cram,2010-04-06 03:30:00,1733,"Short term fix - call the OPP.  They won't know or care about all of the fish and game laws the way a CO does (# of hooks on a lure, etc),  when its something like what you described i'm pretty sure you'll get a response.  Long term fix  - if the fines were larger (and they should be), then there'd be a business case for putting more COs out there (collecting more revenue).   There's a reason cities employ LOTS of parking police...brings in REVENUE."
452467,Jackie,2010-04-06 04:32:00,124,"  That's right....increase the FINES, increase the penalties!!! So they can put more people on the field to catch those RATS...and have general deterrence on every ignorant... Police should also be required to respond to reports...I mean, people are actually breaking laws. It is something serious, because they are harming the environment, causing conflicts between anglers. There were already many cases where anglers been assaulted, push into the lake, or even killed! So this matter should definitely be taken seriously!!  Fish limits should also be LOWER!!!! I mean....30 crappies...6 bass...6 pike...50 perch!!!50 sunfish!!!....WTH????..are you kidding me???? Is it really necessary to keep that many fish per day??? I know they are trying to control the fish population....but I think the MNRs miscounted the population of people in Toronto.....2,503,281!!!...I am not sure how many people fish in Toronto...but if every individual really catch their limits of fish every time....(which is not really hard to do for sunfish, perch, crappie, or even bass)then i don't think there will be any fish left in the lake...Actually, it is happening already as many of you guys notice... Sunfish, crappies, or perch nowadays aren't as easy to catch compare to couple years ago. The size is also smaller compare to what it used to be. I have been on many forums and seen many people showing off their BUCKETS OF FISH. They even try to show off their COOKING SKILLS...5-6 plates of fish on the table..steam, deep fried, bake, boil, soup, etc...sure it looks really tasty. But are you really that poor that you have to fish to eat fish??? It's just ridiculous how people are taking advantage of the fish limits and ignoring the harm caused to the environment... this really makes me sad"
452697,Flappn,2010-04-06 19:20:00,245,I agree with your comments. We need lower limits and higher fines. We are demolishing our great Fishery and Land.
452709,jimmer,2010-04-06 19:36:00,2730,"I just don't get it!  There is more education on these subjects than ever and it just keeps getting worse. I was all for ""no closed season on panfish"", but the MNR is going to have to step up to the plate if this crap is happening, families or no families.  That can be said for any profession, they just have to coordinate their holidays. If the garbage along the access points here bothers you, you should check them out in Florida.  I felt like I was fishing in a landfill site along the Kissimee River a couple years back. I still can't believe that the MNR and police have not come up with a system that works for individuals to call in when they are witnessing poaching.  It will never stop until there is instant response to tips."
451782,Big Cliff,2010-04-04 23:21:00,6899,"So, I was talking to a couple of people over at Long Beach today. Seems there were a bunch of fisher people over there last night fishing on private property which wasn't too big a deal until:  The people fishing were filling up blue coolers; nice to see that the fishing was good. Problem is that every once in a while a car would pull up, drop off some empty coolers, and haul the full ones away.  MNR was suppose to show up but apparently did not. The owner of the property was telling me he has had enough of having to pick up garbage, and toilet paper in the mornings after people have been fishing there so they are finally going to post it as private and just call the cops from now on.  Saddly, there goes another place that people use to be able to shore fish and I really don't blame him."
451793,Joey,2010-04-04 23:45:00,9122,"Your right Cliff, that is a shame and not right.  Why do people have to abuse the system.  I just don't understand what is wrong with some people these days.  I was disgusted this weekend aswell seeing how littered the shoreline was.  I mean if you can carry in the stuff, it has got to be even lighter carrying it out as you drank or used the empty containers you left behind.  My mother taught me to never litter, so who raised these litterbugs?  Okay, end of rant.  Joey"
451797,cram,2010-04-04 23:55:00,1733,And people crap all over landowners who don't want people fishing on their property....its idiots like these who ruin it for everyone.
451803,The JAY,2010-04-05 00:13:00,239,"As a little tip I learned years ago, even with No Trespassing/Fishing/Hunting signs up, if you have personal permission from the landowner, you can still legally use the land.... The signs are more a tool for the police to use to charge someone if they are called out. Just FYI..."
451804,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-05 00:14:00,4399,"I agree it`s digusting, shore fishing area`s usually look like landfills but shorefishermen don`t have the market cornered ever see a wind swept shoreline full of bait containers,beer cans,lure packages etc.alot of boat annglers are just as bad, kinda looks like a neighbourhood that is near a high school!!!"
451806,StoneFly,2010-04-05 00:18:00,574,"Being a river fisherman and sometimes fishing east I see this disgusting speactacle all the time...it really makes me mad,....i think the question is not 'who raised these people'...but moreso 'WHO DID NOT? '  Pigs like that ruin it for all the decent anglers.  I for one cant even stomach leaving anything behind...our cities and towns get polluted enough...why spoil nature?  Its our  place to get away...I have seen some of my favorite spots get closed up over the past few years due to pigs...I hate to play this card...but many countries in the world treat everything as their garbage can...Canada is built on imigrants and our population grows exclusively because of immigration....I personally live in a neighbourhood that 'back home' they throw garbage in the streets..its kinda hard to keep up with as when wind blows it ends up at my place...couple this with how many immigrants fish...there it is.  In a ddition to the 30 seconds and $30 it takes to get a fishing license...Ok...Im ranting..dont get me wrong..I have many Immigrant friends from many cultures...and on the flipside alot of Non-immigrants litter also...You pigs...You should be ashamed,..charged and flogged!!!!"

451834,Sinker,2010-04-05 01:14:00,8692,"Good luck getting a CO to show up anywhere Cliff. I called the tips line on friday too.......no results. There was a small tinny with 3 guys in it, one of them was fishing two lines, and I'm positive they had over thier limit of crappies. I told the one guy it was illegal to fish with two lines, and the new limit on crappies was 30 fish......he just looked at me like I was from outer space. If I didn't have the kids with me, I would have got myself in trouble for sure. I can't stand ignorance like that. I hope to see them again, because I'll make a point of getting nice and close  S."

Southern Ontario is highly populated, and it'll just continue to grow and grow.  There are ignorant asses in every race/religion/creed/whatever, but, the fact is that it will continue to happen.  Some people open their mouths and do something about it, some dont, but either way, nothing positive happens in the end.  Its always the same.  The pigs will always be out there as they've always been."
451907,Stern Rules,2010-04-05 02:49:00,342,"I was just gonna suggest that same thing. Remember those 2 idiots out West I think that got charged for shooting those ducks and posting the video on Youtube. If the authorities can't be everywhere, time for the public to get the evidence. I don't see why they can't be charged with the PROPER evidence."
451925,Beans,2010-04-05 03:09:00,3339,I wonder how much a cooler full of crappies sells for...My bro-in-law and I stopped giving away the ones we caught at Sandercock's Camp when we found out they were selling them a few years ago...  I guess having someone pick-up the coolers and dropping off empty ones is a way of trying to get around the 30 crappie limit...  Damn the MNR for inconveniencing them like that...

Yes the MNR has limited resources---one would imagine that they start to prioritize-----I'm sure people wishin to target trout on the beds in areas out of season or sanctuaries may be higher profile than crappie hunters or litterers.  Wish to fix it all----you bet----But--your only going to spread one or two guys so far. (maybe they should pursue clone technology)"
452002,bigugli,2010-04-05 12:17:00,6138,The CO's were on minimum staffing for the holiday weekend. Something to do with collective agreements and holiday payouts that were too costly. We couldn't get them for the Niagara Outdoor Show as a result.
452003,Meegs,2010-04-05 12:20:00,249," be careful with that one Jay.    your still allowed on the property if the landowner gives you permission to be on it when there is a no tresspassing sign up!    If the owner of the property puts up a no hunting or no fishing sign up then no one, including the owner is allowed to hunt or fish!    Its a stupid law, but I know of a landowner that got charged for just that!    If he puts up a no tresspassing sign and gives you the go ahead the its all good."
