You've got to pick and choose your spots now, but I've been off the big lakes since last Tuesday.  Thought I'd share some pics from the latter half of my ice season.  LOTW Pike on a tip-up/quick strike rig with a big live sucker.    We had a blast with these whitefish on a lake about 30 mins from home.    Good numbers of whitefish and always a welcomed treat when one of these guys would show up.    Seems every lake I fished this year I managed to find one of these guys.    I finished my season on Lake Minnitaki, which is all of 5 mins from town.  It's a massive system in itself and has excellent walleye fishing as well and nice pike and lake trout.  We were intercepting the big walleye on their way to a spawning river.  It was actually difficult to catch fish under 18"" to keep for the pan.        Some buddies with nice walleye.        Although we were targeting walleye it's always nice when a couple surprises show up.      Real early spring up here, that's for sure.  A couple spots open now for launching a boat.  Walleye doesn't close till April 14th so the next outing will be in the boat."
