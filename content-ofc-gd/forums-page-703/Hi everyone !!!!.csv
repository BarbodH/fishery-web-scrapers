451989,Big Cliff,2010-04-05 11:09:00,6899," It was nice seeing you again yesterday Shawn, too bad you had to leave so early but if it makes you feel any better, I fished until about 6:30 and the fishing didn't improve much. Too many boats running through I think.  take care, glad to see you posting again.  Cliff"
