452103,johnnyb,2010-04-05 16:41:00,3413,I was casting to the edge of the ice sheet a couple weeks ago...no such thing as too early   Good luck!!!!!
452118,ciscokid,2010-04-05 17:30:00,52,Im also going up this weekend to the bancroft area. As long as there's open water ur good.
452130,torco,2010-04-05 18:02:00,656, Be sure to check your regulations book depending on the lake. The number of exception to the general rules in zone 15 is quite extensive.
452132,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-05 18:04:00,0,why not!?!?!?! they should be cruising the shorelines looking for easy meals like winterkilled baitfish etc... just make sure you post pics if you get any!
