452455,e-z-out,2010-04-06 03:51:00,1052,   official website.
452463,Jonny,2010-04-06 04:06:00,1380,Thanks. That's about as much as there is anywhere.  The show's organizers and sponsors don't seem to have discovered the importance of the internet yet.
452466,bigugli,2010-04-06 04:24:00,6138,"Pathetic web page. No vendor list, particulars, contact link.  It just does not give you that ""We want your business"" feeling.  Place could be full of jobbers and C-list bazaar vendors for all I know."
452490,gdelongchamp,2010-04-06 10:54:00,199,"I go to this show every year. Believe me, it's nothing worth traveling to from out of town. And the upstairs hall they refer to is a room the size of a badminton court. For locals it's ok I guess but it wouldn't surprise me if visitor satisfaction is very low. Approx. 6.00 entry fee and free parking. There were no fishing rods or reels on display last year that I recall. Legend boats puts up a nice display but they are also at the Shopping centre this week. So they may not be at the show?  Last year the organizers handed out a nice fishing jig to the first 100. Ramako's (the local fishermaen's hotspot) is putting on a thing this Wed at the Howard Johnson. I beleive Big CLiff is a speaker that night. This one is worth the price of entry. Ramako's was not at the show last year or the year before."
452491,gdelongchamp,2010-04-06 10:56:00,199,I recall only about four or five fishing outfitters here as well. But I support the show and go every year.
452597,LipDip,2010-04-06 15:31:00,39,Anybody remember when that tornado wiped out all of Garson a few years back? Entire town was leveled. Damages were estimated at over twevle hundred bucks.
452599,Jonny,2010-04-06 15:34:00,1380," Good to know, thanks. I was considering a drive from North Bay but I wanted to scare up some info first. Looks like I'll pass."
