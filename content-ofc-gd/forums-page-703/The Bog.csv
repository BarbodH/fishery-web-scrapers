451730,highdrifter,2010-04-04 21:05:00,2534," OK OK..  My bad.  I thought the bog was a sheltered area off the main lake with tons of cabbage and very little depth.  I'd fished the area from a boat with some good friends from the board and didn't know that the bog we were fishing included the whole lake.  Guess it's all pretty much the same when you think about it.  I apologize for my custy, punky remarks.  Someone musta crapped in my wheaties.  Good post fishingfool."

452023,Beans,2010-04-05 13:47:00,3339," I do believe those""spots by the highway"" (causeway) are part of a fish sanctuary until the second Saturday of May...  Nice way to get a guy suckered into a ticket..."
452055,fluffmaster,2010-04-05 14:51:00,5,The dock at the public boat launch and the area behind the library on the BOG were on fire for crappies. try here if you don't have a boat.  But remember as already stated the 7a causeway is a sanctuary
452058,Hud,2010-04-05 14:55:00,140,Nice to meet you too Stan.  btw... that da** fillet of fish song is still stuck in my head.
452079,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-05 16:06:00,4399,  That was not my intent!!
452395,discophish,2010-04-06 02:07:00,392,"Hey Fishnfool.  Thanks for the report and update on this ""bog"" place.  Is that somewhere in Thunder Bay?  If I can round the squareness of my car wheels and find my steering wheel, maybe I will drive there and check it out.  Do I follow the route that says ""bog"" on the map?  It sounds really interesting.  What's a ""bog""?  Are we expected to know?  Come to think of it, I know.  But wait, apparently I am not welcome to fish there.  Good thing you left your camera at home, because I'm sure it would have revealed your location.  Hmmm.  So it really doesn't make a difference then.  Anyway, Great job on the Crappie and thanks for the update.  I hope to get out to open water myself in a week.  Some would be relieved that I'm going straight north rather than east I'm sure."
452421,Nanook,2010-04-06 02:50:00,565,"Dont know 'bout revealing location, but the post got 1,125 hits"
452574,fish-miester,2010-04-06 14:35:00,864,wow I love this site..
452588,tightline,2010-04-06 15:11:00,322,"Do you have any clue as to how many fishing sites there are in Ontario alone? Google it, for you to say that ""your"" spot has been overrun because of fishinfools post is absurd.  It's funny I think when everyone on here hopes there children, there childrens children and so on learn to fish, just as long as it's not in there hole.  We had a beautiful weekend, hmmmmmmm maybe that brought a few out.  And for the record I've never heard of Scugog being called the Bog, thanks Kemper, now I know  Great report fishinfool, glad you did so well out there.  Btw next time be sure to take your camera, you never know who you can piss off on here with a great photo or two.  Between this and Dr. Sals post on ""lurkers"" this whole argument is getting way too old.  Anybody with a set of eyes and basic fishing knowledge can find good spots, so when I see the trout elitists standing in the middle of a rapid, or casting to that tiny pool right behind a rock, or drifting any bend with a hole on one side, do you think were surprised??  All you photo nazi's, with your new forums and members only crap, OLD OLD OLD, quit bashing peoples posts for your own agenda!"
451566,fishinfool,2010-04-04 13:02:00,366,"Got together with Hud and Newfieman yesterday on the Bog. We absolutely slayed the Crappie, a fish with almost every cast. The average size was 8 to 10 inches and the odd bonus big one thrown in for good measure. I caught one about 15 inches. Didn't take my camera, so no pics. Sorry guys. Nice finally meeting you Hud, gotta get out again soon."
451570,cityfisher,2010-04-04 13:10:00,959,"I was ask on the bog for the afternoon  , good crappy forsure"
451572,Jer,2010-04-04 13:14:00,1426,We've been having a blast with the early season crappie as well. I always knew we were missing the best bite having to wait for the end of April.
451573,kemper,2010-04-04 13:16:00,2232,"good fishin but...  I gotta say I wish people would ease up on the location posting. I was out two nights ago and where I have been fishing in relative peace for several years there were 50-60 glow floats bobbing around. I realize Lake Scugog is no secret, but a lot of people read/lurk this board and I guarantee tonight there will be an extra ten down there searching for crappies.  end rant.  This is why I stopped posting, back to hibernation."
451576,Jer,2010-04-04 13:28:00,1426,"  How is he giving up his location? Seems to me all he mentioned was the lake, it's a pretty darn big lake. So far at our best spot on Buckhorn, we haven't seen another boat."
451582,kemper,2010-04-04 13:48:00,2232," The lake is big, but its the shore spots that are limited. I probably wouldn't notice the effect if I had a boat, but since I'm grounded..."
451586,4thgen,2010-04-04 13:52:00,157," It doesn't matter to me if people want to post reports and spots etc. etc. With that said, I can see where he's coming from. Scugog is not only the closest crappie lake to Toronto, but it only has so many shore access spots as well (having a boat like yourself severely limits competition but we all can't be so lucky). Combine these factors with a post saying the crappie are on fire and I'm sure there will be a few extra fishermen making the trip from Toronto and thereabouts.  Anyway, looks like a good trip -- a 15"" crappie is huge! I'm still looking at ice up here. Hopefully it breaks earlier than last year (last week in April)."
451602,fishinfool,2010-04-04 14:56:00,366,"Well if it makes a difference, the spot that I was in was not do-able from the shore and there was only three other boats in there with us. There are dozens of spots all over the lake that produce. I figure if anyone has a boat and fishes, they will be heading that way in any case. The ones without boats, well they are limited in where they can go. I really don't think telling people ""the crappie are on fire"" is going to make people drop what they are doing and run out all nilly willy to fish. Maybe I'm wrong."
451603,irishfield,2010-04-04 15:01:00,26272,....anybody seen my drain plug.. I've got the truck running and the boat hooked on but I can't find my drain plug!!!!  Thanks for the report fishinfool..
451631,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-04 15:51:00,4399,"Some people have got lighten up on the location thing, now you can`t mention a lake?? What`s next you can`t mention the province??  The more crappie removed from Scugog the better the Walleye appreciate it!!!"
451640,splashhopper,2010-04-04 16:15:00,2931, yep.. you are wrong....  Try to see it from the perspective of a NON-BOATER's point of view... then you will understand the shoes that kemper and I walk in .. thanks you for consideration.  Splashhopper
451643,Lostchild,2010-04-04 16:27:00,153,i guess if everybody is going to Scugog then the other 100 000 lakes and rivers should be pretty quiet....the river guys should love this
451658,highdrifter,2010-04-04 17:08:00,2534," It might be a large(ish) body of water, but the bog itself is a particular location and it's quite small compared to the main lake.  I personally know some guys who fish the area, and seeing this post would make them cringe and grind their teeth.  There's a rule on posting specific locations for obvious reasons.  Why not just say the fishing was hot on Scugog??!!  D'UUHHH!!"
451663,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-04 17:15:00,4399, Yep you`re wrong too!!  Don`t post locations because of the non boaters geez you guys are getting silly.
451664,fishinfool,2010-04-04 17:16:00,366," Lake Scugog to me is called the Bog, not any specific area or spot. If I have a good day fishing and wish to let my friends know about it on OFC then guess what... Some of you guys are dumb as stumps! The lake is big, i'm sure that the people looking for info online will come across the fact that the Crappie are on all over the place with the early warm spell. Go fishing guys and don't bother continuing with your dumb comments. I for one am not going to get drawn into your childish rants and opinions. For the members on here who are looking for more specific locations, pm me. Stan"
451666,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-04 17:22:00,4399," The Bog is a location? The whole god darned Port Perry side of the lake is pretty much a swamp/bog. You and your pals with the cringing teeth should relax and get your rods take up your spot by the highway and do your part to rid Scugog of the invasive specie,the Walleye will thank you and I thank you."
451682,Sinker,2010-04-04 18:05:00,8692,"There are enough crappies to go around. With a long weekend, and beautiful weather, there would be people out regardless of any postings of good fishing. Word travels fast, even without the net.  Glad to hear ya had a good day Stan. We've been having a blast with them too!  S."

451695,highdrifter,2010-04-04 18:57:00,2534, BAAHAAH!!  You couldn't pay me to fish that sludge fest..
451706,EC1,2010-04-04 19:38:00,930,"Kemper is right about it somewhat...I think I know the spot he is talking about, and last year's opener yielded maybe 10 people total, and I got to slam the crappie practically all to myself...This year, there's probably 30 people there every night.  But hey, it's not like the bog is that much of a secret anyways. Sharing is great, and it wasn't like gps coords were given. And when you gentlemen find yourself a spot you'd like to keep secret, hide them like they're the stuff you usually keep under your bed!"
451708,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-04 19:52:00,2582," Myself and everyone I fish with have always referred to Scugog as the ""bog"" or ""Scubog"" and it was a given that it was referring to the whole lake.  So in my eyes he did in fact say fishing was hot on Scugog and was not being location specific.  And for the record. I fished the bog Thursday and Saturday. And did good. I even got a nice 3.5-4LB largie yesterday. I was considering posting a picture JUST to give a few people who have there panties on too tight and nothing better to do, something to whizz and moan about"
451711,fishinfool,2010-04-04 20:07:00,366," Hey crappieperchhunter, it really does suck that we have so many bozos on this site. Glad to hear you did well on the ""bog"". I might get back out in the next couple of days, I hope they are still hot. Stan"
451712,skeeter,2010-04-04 20:18:00,1907,"irishfield, i found my spare plug. what time you picking me up?  nice to here you slammed the crappy!!!!!  i was out icefishing  awhile back. 578 feet straight out from the 3rd dock at goreski's in 8.3' of water i had a tip up set with 3 minnows and i slammed the largest crappy i have ever seen. but the guy i was fishing with said they were out of season so i released it. i think its probably still there so im going out with irishfield as soon as he picks me up. watch out ol'gus im coming back......."
451722,irishfield,2010-04-04 20:36:00,26272,Sorry Dan.. couldn't wait.. found the end of a broom stick and jammed it in there. Fish for supper..is all I can say!
