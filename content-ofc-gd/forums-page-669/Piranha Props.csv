I need a new prop and checking out their website they sound pretty good and are fairly inexpensive. Do they break easy? Are they trouble free? Any performance issues?  Any info is greatly appreciated. thanks, brufan"

Next time we hit bottom on simcoe we took of our prop and looked at it and realized when you hit the whole prop needs to be replaced if you want top performance. I don't know what the performace is but that's why we did not buy it.
