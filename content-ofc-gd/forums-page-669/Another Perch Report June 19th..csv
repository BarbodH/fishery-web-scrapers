So we moved to shallower waters and we started catching. The place we launched was Mohawk Marine, east of Maitland nice place and very friendly, bought our minnows there and head out to the left about 1 mile to 28 to 30 FTW. started drifting till we found them, then anchored. Was slow at first, then non stop catching. We had to leave early for other comitments. Ended the day with 60 nice keepers. I think were heading back in a couple days. ""Oh"" and the Walleye are in close around 50 FTW. for the flat line trollers   Take a few heavy split shot and a big Erie worm harness with a big juicy night Crawler back a couple hundred feet or so. Place... it's a big lake, some place around Maitland. Go getem."
