476717,Jer,2010-06-17 10:22:00,1426,"I have the same motor, bought new in 2000. It's been a good motor, no issues with it at all.  Like any used motor, it's condition really comes down to how it was maintained over the years.  Fuel consumption is in line with most two strokes of that size."
476743,bow slayer,2010-06-17 12:46:00,1074,Is it a 2 stroke   or 4 stroke?  I just last week bought a 04 Johnson 70 4 stroke  which is really a Suzuki and from everything I have heard is a awesome motor.  If it is a 4 stoke then it will be a Suzuki and a great motor.
476748,Billy Bob,2010-06-17 13:00:00,5865,I don't think Johnson had 4 stroke engines in 2000.
476795,archer379,2010-06-17 16:18:00,277,I have a 1999 70 2 stroke it pushes my 17.5 crestliner at about 35 mph I haven't had any proplems with it
476862,RudeBuoy,2010-06-17 23:07:00,28,Just have it checked out first. Compression and a leak down tests. Check the lower unit for water in the gear oil etc.  The motor is usually the largest investment on a used boat. Spend the scratch to have it checked properly.  Johnnyrudes are good in my books.
