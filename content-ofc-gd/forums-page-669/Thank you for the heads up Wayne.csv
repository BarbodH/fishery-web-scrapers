477411,Bernie,2010-06-19 23:15:00,3190,I made the trek to New Liskeard this morning to the estate sale that Wayne had brought up here a couple weeks back. Among the many outboards and thousands of other items I came home with the nicest engine at the sale. A 1958 Johnson 18 HP in very good condition. Even the applique on the front of the hood is clear and not cracked. And a bonus I wasn't expecting until I seen it. It's an electric start. I'm as happy as a pig in ****. I'll check out the coils and replace the water pump this week and maybe change it over to a single line fuel tank. I can't wait to give it a try. Thank you again Wayne!

Walter was a GREAT guy... he'd be really happy to know that it's you Bernie, part of the Giesler family, that has it now !  We've gotta thank Leah for the original information as well.. lol  What else did you buy Bernie.. I'm kinda glad I couldn't attend.. lol"

There were a couple of other outboards I was interested in but a lightning storm complete with hail came over just as I finished the buy on the 18. Quickly loaded up my prize into the truck and headed home, satisfied. My dad will be happy more space won't be needed in the shed too."
