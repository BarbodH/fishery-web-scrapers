476712,Lunatic,2010-06-17 08:53:00,536,"thats not much money to play with, id be looking on kijiji for a nice yamaha. since martin and taylor are out of the question go with a yamaha. i have a yamaha APX 500 and love it. its an electric/acoustic and it has a very nice tone. someone suggested to walk into long & mcquiad and try them all out. thats exactly what i did and the sound of that apx sounded just as good as some guitars in the 1000.00 range. i also have a dean ML,just wish i had a better amp for it!"
476737,Cookslav,2010-06-17 12:26:00,1457,"Start with a 6, if you learn it well then get a 12. They both have their place, but if you're learning a 6 is the way to go.  Forget about name brands... Go into the store, and try a few on for size. If its comfy, and you like the sound...check the price tag. If its out of you're range move along, and keep trying.  I'd almost bet the farm that for $400 you'll be getting a yammy, and nothing wrong with that. They make decent middle of the road guitars, I've played a few yammys that were nicer then the BC rich I'm used to playing LOL...  Don't be name snob dude....Find a sound and feel you like."

476936,pigless,2010-06-18 04:10:00,22,"Garrison makes a pretty good sounding guitar. The ones I've tried have all had a very deep & warm tone to them. I believe it's also Canadian. Not entirely sure what stores carries them, but I've seen them at Steve's on Queen St."
476943,Angler16,2010-06-18 04:44:00,188,Thanks for all the great replies. I was looking at the Seagull guitars how much are they usually?

477333,Rice Laker,2010-06-19 15:04:00,24,"I am musically challenged, can't even play a tambourine, but if I were buying a guitar, I would buy a Taylor. I learned about them after seeing the following video on YouTube:  Great true story about Dave Carroll's problem with United Airlines. Dave (from Halifax NS)has become famous worldwide because of this video. Google him as well for more info."

I'm not sure if Taylor makes an entry level unit but it seems to me my bro spent something over 2 grand for each of his. I kinda remember numbers like 3,000 being bandied about. One of his looks a bunch like that cutaway model the guy was playing in the vid.  JF"

I was looking for some advice on acoustic guitars. Im thinking of getting one after exams are over and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.Im not quite sure weather I want 6 or 12 string yet so some input on both would be great. I like a warm sounding guitar, lately ive been playing stuff from Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams but I also like to take other songs from bands and make them into an acoustic song like Iron maiden and stuff. Im willing to spend up to $400.  Any help would be appreciated,  Again, Happy to be back!  Thanks  L.A"

476277,danbouck,2010-06-16 10:42:00,4380,For a base acoustic the yamaha's are a great guitar. I am sticking to my 20 year old Samick right now but would love another yamaha. Go with a 6 string until you can grow your collection.
476307,Calender Don,2010-06-16 12:55:00,39,"My Son is into the music business, when he went to California to tape a TV show we bought him a cheap Yamaha guitar $200 from Long and Macquade to take on the road and of all the guitars he has the Yamaha acoustic is the one that he has record the most it has a good sound."
476316,Chris,2010-06-16 13:21:00,405,"We used a Yamaha acoustic to record the acoustic tracks on our CD and were very happy with the sound, however it belonged to the studio and I have no idea what it was worth. You may want to check out Godin Guitars. Very good quality in the price range you are looking at and Canadian made. They also sell guitars under several other names (Norman, Art & Luthrie, Simon & Patrick, Lapatrie, etc.). I have had a Norman guitar for almost 30 yrs and it still has excellent sound quality.  http://www.godinguitars.com/"
476331,craigdritchie,2010-06-16 13:40:00,1586,"Six-string is more versatile than a 12, so if you have one guitar, go that route and add a 12-string later.  Best thing to do is visit a couple of different music stores and play a bunch of guitars, then buy the one that feels right in your hands. Forget what it says on the nameplate. You buy guitars with your eyes closed and your ears open. I'd only suggest you forgo the real cheapies. For $400, you can buy a very nice guitar.  All the makes mentioned previously are good bets. I'll add Washburn to the list, since I have a 25-year old Washburn six-string that is still my favourite guitar. There are excellent guitars coming from Japan and Korea these days too, including the previously-mentioned Yamahas (I love mine) as well as Fender's current top-of-the-line electrics."
476336,jimmer,2010-06-16 13:48:00,2730,"I have had a Yamaha since the early 70's and I love it.  Can't go wrong, but definitely try a couple different ones before buying. Everyone has different hands and likes a different feel to a guitar."
476338,NAW,2010-06-16 13:55:00,4022,"No complaints with my Norman.  Picked it up for $325, cut away with a pick up.  It was a scratch and dent deal, but I still haven't been able to find the scratches??  If I where to buy another guitar, I'd be looking at Seagull, I've always liked them, just couldn't afford one.  And I have to agree with all the Yamaha posts.  They're work horses.  I don't own one, but know lots of people that do, and love them."
476344,The JAY,2010-06-16 14:04:00,239,"Yamahas? I've had good and bad, Norman's are nice, Seagulls are very nice, and Godin make some great guitars. My advice is to go into Long & McQuade, try every guitar that catches your eye, even if there are 2 of the same model they may play very differently, especially with less expensive models. Low price doesn't always mean poor quality, just less consistant quality in the line. I've played some beautiful $250 Yamahas...  What it all boils down to is until it's in your hands, you just never know... Good luck with the purchase!"
476348,JohnF,2010-06-16 14:10:00,3494,"I gave up on buying guitars when I realized my son was just gonna confiscate them anyway. As he says ""I'm good, you really suck."" Not a very nice way of justifying theft but painfully honest.  I really liked my yamaha acoustics when I played. My bro is a pretty darned good guitar player and despite using only Taylors on stage and in the studio he has a lot of cheap(ish) Yammies and others that he really likes in private. He says the trick is mostly in setting them up right. The first thing he does is tear the guitar apart and tweak the neck, reshape the nut(?) and make sure the screws (machines) are working properly. Then he fiddles with the height of the frets (unless it's fretless of course) and finally uses decent strings. If you're really serious about smooth action & a sweet sound for not much money you might ask around the music world wherever you live and see if there are any player/mechanics like my bro who can suggest a good sleeper brand that for a few more bucks can be made sweet.  I picked up a no-name 12 string about 25 years ago (Sigma) that was of course confiscated. Now my bro and my son fight over who gets to use it. Rick (bro) set it up and likes the tone for the studio and Matt (son) really likes it on stage for his occasional breaks from the bass. Rick says it's the best feeling/sounding 12 string he's played since his Ovation (black round body) which he still kicks himself for selling in a poverty stricken moment.  From listening to my bro I've come to the conclusion that there's always the chance of finding a silk purse masquerading as a sow's ear (in guitars that is) that with a little work can be a pretty nice guitar.  Sorry if none of this is helpful but I was sitting here sipping coffe and it just seemed the right time to expound on something about which I know next to nothing.  JF"
476363,Sherriff,2010-06-16 14:44:00,252,I have Godin solid body electric and a Seagull acoustic.  Both Canadian made as said above and both great sounding and looking guitars.  Sherriff
476407,Fang,2010-06-16 16:44:00,1330,"Look around for some shops that have some used stuff. Down in Oakville there's 2 nice shops to poke around in. On Kerr street down towards Lakeshore, there's GEAR Music. They sell Yamaha, Martin and have some used every now and then. I bought a Martin DX from them a few years ago and can't say enough about how nice it plays and sounds. It's warmed up really nice and sounds great out around the firepit. I did take it right down to 12th fret in TO and have them do a set up.  When it gets right down to it take a trip to Long & McQuade and just pick each one off the shelf and strum away. If price, sound and playability is all good then mark it on your list."
476441,Headhunter,2010-06-16 18:03:00,5703,"I will 2nd the buy used folks. You will get twice the guitar for 1/2 the money by doing a little work on Craig's List. If you have some playing skill, you will know the right guitar as soon as you pick it up. HH"
476459,douG,2010-06-16 18:42:00,2693,"I still feel a little wave of joy every time after picking up and tuning my Seagull.  When you are trying out potential new guitars, don't be surprised if the one you must have is a little outside your price range.  You won't regret putting a deposit on it and delaying your purchase a little while longer."

Also have a 12 Takamine, love the full sound of the 12.  Will admit I prefer playing my friends Yamaha 12 though!  Go with the 6 before a 12 for sure."
476488,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-16 19:43:00,0,"for the style of sound and budget you have, i'd look to spend that full budget on a yamaha.  also, the moment you buy it, take off the factory strings and put on something of quality.  i myself use elixirs but any quality string  will help you find your tone.  rock on!"
