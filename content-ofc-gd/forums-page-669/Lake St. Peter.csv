476680,Braz,2010-06-17 02:19:00,9, It was just a question not sure why all the flak and my response to nothing was just to get it back on top of the thread to see if anyone had any advice I get it could have been missed.  I am a catch and release guy and it is really for the kids to experience fishing.  So thanks for the help if you have any if not I get the hint

I have never heard of any amazing catches, but maybe it's one of those best kept secrets!  Sometimes the smallies will be in deeper water on those lakes, look for them on the bottom of 25'."
476838,jimmer,2010-06-17 20:47:00,2730,"I forgot to mention that there are a lot of other lakes in the area that might be worth trying if you are trailering a boat.  Baptiste and Elephant Lake are good, Salmon Trout Lake is good at times, Hay Lake is also fun."
