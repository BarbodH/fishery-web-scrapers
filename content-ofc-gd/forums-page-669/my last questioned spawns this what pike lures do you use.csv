476245,danc,2010-06-16 03:40:00,4677,"I don't target Pike very often, but tossing out a dead bait and letting it sit on bottom has always worked well for me. We've been getting a bunch in our back yard in downtown Red Lake recently. Frozen ciscoes are the trick here, but I've also had equal success with smelts and raw bacon elsewhere.  Back yard Pike.  "
476399,Garry2Rs,2010-06-16 16:35:00,1425,I have good luck with the gold and the silver/blue Rapala Husky Jerks. Also the gold Live Target Smelt. The main forage in my Pike lake is Rock Bass so I guess that explains the gold. I have sometimes done well on spinnerbaits too. A Musky lure called a Grandma works good in the smaller size. Garry2rs
476633,pikeguy,2010-06-17 01:08:00,195,"red and white spinner bait with a gulp 4"" minnow or smelt is my favorite"
476659,Rizzo,2010-06-17 01:41:00,4754,five of diamonds...leave everything else at home
476699,alexcba,2010-06-17 04:28:00,634,"favorite lure for pike was and just again recently became the banjo minnow. albeit bass will attack it aswell but i try to use the 9"" banjo.. keeps most of them at bay and lets the pike get a good run at it."
476753,wankerjohn123,2010-06-17 13:29:00,117, Raw bacon.. never tried that. Just let it sit on bottom? Would it not fall off?
476912,skinny,2010-06-18 02:06:00,442,thanks guys for the input I'm going to try to get out tomorrow
