Im looking into fishing mainly Atlantics, maybe Pinks if I wait long enough for the run. Would also love to get into resident fish.  Does anyone have any info on the area?  Ive looked around buy cant find much, I am looking to get into good runs of fish, or good streams with resident fish. Only considering the drive if the fishing will be significantly better than what I can get into down here.  Also heard Lake Superior Provincial Park can be good, would be willing to fish this area also.  Any info is greatly appreciated, PM if necessary.  Thanks in advance  Mike"
