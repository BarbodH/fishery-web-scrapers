476835,Terry,2010-06-17 20:40:00,14456,here is a lund with a 250vtiller
476843,bdox,2010-06-17 21:01:00,329,"Yeah, Mercury's new ""Big Tiller"" system. You can pretty much put a tiller handle on any of their new motors, add hydrualics, and you're good to go."
476852,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-17 22:24:00,2585,you can slap that pic in your friends lap and see what they say haha  Here is Oakville there is a guy with a 175 tiller.
476928,craigdritchie,2010-06-18 03:16:00,1586,"Mercury will put their Big Tiller handle on just about anything they make. I saw a 250 Pro XS with tiller steering last year, on the back of a Lund 2075. Didn't have an opportunity to drive it, but would have enjoyed taking it for a spin."
