475725,SylvanOwner,2010-06-14 20:30:00,266,Do you wipe off the bird poop as well?....great pic!!
475889,Joey,2010-06-15 03:45:00,9122,"LOL, that's hilarious.  Joey"
475983,Tom McCutcheon,2010-06-15 15:38:00,627,What happens when the water levels rise? Who is responsible for the garbage now floating/drifting/sunk in the river for some unsuspecting boater to encounter?  not that funny.
475990,alexcba,2010-06-15 16:04:00,634,i doubt he put that lazy boy there.. someone may have but im sure he just took the pic cause its not something you see everyday. well not unless you fish the humber lol.
476010,bigbuck,2010-06-15 16:41:00,2449,"Jeez, a little levity folks!! Lungelarry is having some fun here. I really don't think he put that chair on the rock. However I'd like to catch up with the doorknob who put the chair there and strap him to it when the water level is rising.  Good one larry!!!"
476351,fishing_noob,2010-06-16 14:17:00,12,lmao that chair has histoplasmosis written all over it
476515,Toronto_Angler,2010-06-16 20:24:00,698,  Wow you must be a hoot at parties

476701,bigfish1965,2010-06-17 04:36:00,3382, I thought it said 'Lazy Boy'...really need to get my eyes checked again.
476707,PikeMolester,2010-06-17 05:45:00,428,That's hilarious! We went 2 weeks ago and died laughing at this chair. Proof!   
476714,Handlebarz,2010-06-17 09:18:00,3790,I know Tom very well and he is one of the best cooks(if you had his prime rib you would know why I said best cook first) and a hell of a great guy and you want funny get ready to piss your self if you meet him. Tom must have had a off night or did not catch the funny part of the pic as he is very passionate about people leaving junk. As for the pic it is a funny thing to see and a great topic starter when your having a slow day on the water. So when does the guiding start to the spot and do you supply the minnows?
476774,fishing_noob,2010-06-17 14:47:00,12, oh its the lung disease you get from bat guano and bird droppings lol.
476818,Lungelarry,2010-06-17 18:36:00,294,"Hey Canucker, I thought about doing something like that ,but when I saw all that bird crap I decided not too. Hope you washed your feet  :clapping:"
476945,PikeMolester,2010-06-18 04:55:00,428,I turned over the cushion so it was fine. All the poop was on the back of the chair.
476975,fishing_noob,2010-06-18 13:05:00,12,someone should go out there and put a garden gnome on the chair
