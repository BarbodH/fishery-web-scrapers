477251,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-19 05:04:00,10439,  My buddies dad used to drag race big block powered ski boats with vee drives. He's got 130 stiches in his right leg from a blowover during one race. His parachute pulled him free during the blowover but he carved up his leg on the gunnel as he was pulled free. He was still racing into his mid sixties.
