477103,discophish,2010-06-18 19:47:00,392,That looks a little too perfect.  Are you sure those aren't implants?  Can I decide for myself if you let me touch it?

477203,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-19 01:13:00,10439,I like a nice rack!!!
477225,vinnimon,2010-06-19 02:29:00,2593,  A tender rack would be good for a snack before bed time
477227,fish_fishburn,2010-06-19 02:49:00,1311,"That s a nice rack BillyBob, but I have to break the news to ya. Canadian Pork racks rock"
477286,Billy Bob,2010-06-19 11:55:00,5865," Yes, but here's the thing.....I live less then 15 miles from our boarder and have been to the Great White North hundreds of times. So who's to say that this rack has some Canadian or not in them...  Only the consumer will know or will they....."
477305,Fish Farmer,2010-06-19 12:35:00,2234,"Nice looking rack, your makin me hungry."
