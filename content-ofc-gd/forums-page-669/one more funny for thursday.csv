Only this year I'm gonna do it a little different. The last few years, I took your advice about where to go. Three years ago you said to go to Hawaii .. I went to Hawaii and Molly got pregnant.  Then two years ago, you told me to go to the Bahamas and Molly got pregnant again.  Last year you suggested Tahiti and darn me, if Molly didn't get pregnant again.""  Murphy asks Paddy, ""So, what you gonna do this year that's different?"" Paddy says, ""This year I'm taking Molly with me."""
