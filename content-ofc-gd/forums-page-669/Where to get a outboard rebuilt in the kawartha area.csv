476789,muskylund1,2010-06-17 15:32:00,18,"You could try Sanders Mechanical. 657-2090. RR 1 Lakefield, Buckhorn Peterborough. I blew a cylinder while I was staying on Lower Buckhorn lake several years ago. They installed a new powerhead for me fairly quickly. I don't know if they would do rebuilds this time of year or not, but they seem honest and do good work. The owners of the resort that we always stay at trust them.  Tom"
