477089,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 19:06:00,117, Beans...  Give me his name and number. HA! Sure I can make room for him on my trip somewhere!!
477110,alexcba,2010-06-18 19:55:00,634," anytime john, i fish thru out the week, and every weekend were out on a lake somewhere."
477111,davew3,2010-06-18 19:57:00,430,I guess I would as soon as I could.  Flat lake no noise is the best time.
477119,Black_Blade,2010-06-18 20:10:00,258,"After reading all the replies, I seem to gather that the main thing about the going out early is more so for the peacefulness etc.  I love this also, but is the fishing any better really early?  Is the angling a tad easier before the sun rises and the fish head for deeper hiding holes?  I've sort of been curious about this as well over the years..."
477126,fish_fishburn,2010-06-18 20:28:00,1311,"I'm a thermos guy myself. Grind some good beans and make a real coffee. I drink mine black. Thats why I don't drink Tims, there coffee is crap. I know all you timmies guys are mostly double double. Two tablespoons of sugar and about 4oz of cream, guess that makes it drinkable. I think I'm in trouble now, haha. Just my opinion."
477127,cpguy29,2010-06-18 20:31:00,148,Early bird catches the worms...er...uh..fish.
477189,Billy Bob,2010-06-19 00:15:00,5865, Actually I drink mine HOT with just a little bit of cream...when I go anywhere and order coffee I ask for cream on the side because I only use about half of what one of those little creamers are.  Stopped using a thermos years ago....maybe I should go back to one.....I have a Stanley around here somewhere.  Bob
477226,OhioFisherman,2010-06-19 02:42:00,6623,"My favorite time was anytime I could get out! Actually most of my bigger bass have come between 10am and 2 or 3pm, though anytime of day for numbers. Pike? after dark I don`t bother, but most of the biggest ones were between 4pm and dark. Walleye? any time of day. Same with cats. Skis? I have had problems landing, but anytime for a hookup.  I have been on the water at 6am and still out at dark, and gone out just before dark and still on the water a noon."
477282,wormdunker,2010-06-19 11:07:00,1711,I'm for Timmies @ the launch!!  My favourite launch is 96 km to the nearest gas staion.  Do ya think a drive thru would be profitable? my name is Brian   I'm a fish a holic
477289,Billy Bob,2010-06-19 12:03:00,5865," Brian, you're my kind of man. I like the way you think. YES drive through Timmy's designed for those of us who tow fishing boats (other boaters not welcome)...LOL.....we'll maybe hunting boats but that's it...   :good:"
477303,kitch,2010-06-19 12:34:00,42,"Early in the morning is best, on water before sun comes up.  Even if the fish are not biting, the solitude of the lake is wonderful.  Cup of coffee from the thermos, and just watch the world wake up.  I am not sure that I catch anything more getting up early, but it sure makes for a great way to start the day."
476952,Billy Bob,2010-06-18 09:50:00,5865,How early do you like to get out on the water.....I have friends (I know hard to believe) that don't like going real early...I like to travel on the road before any traffic and be on the water just before light as I think it's the BEST time of any day even if the damn fish aren't biting again.  Now if I could just talk Tim Horton's into building right next to all the boat launches so I would have that second cup of coffee on the water as God intended.... Bob
476954,Jason B,2010-06-18 10:43:00,15,"I Like to be at my spot EARLY.  None of my friends can get up, so that's why i mainly fish solo."
476956,Fisherman,2010-06-18 11:18:00,7201,"Early, beat the boat launch cluster fuddle."
476957,splashhopper,2010-06-18 11:18:00,2931,i like being on the water at daybreak too. 
476958,dave524,2010-06-18 11:29:00,4508,"Depends, stream and river trout fishing... early no question, big water like Ontario or Erie going out to the blue zone 10+ miles out, been burned once too often by a predawn calm run out only to have a white knuckle run in shortly after the sun comes up and the winds pick up, I now wait a bit there before making the run out. Bass fishing, had good luck at all hours, but my favourite time was when my parents had a cottage in Haliburton and I'd get up very early and slide the canoe in the water with a flyrod amd work the shoreline, not so much for the fishing but enjoyed the quiet and the sounds of the world waking up. Walleye, Erie they bite good all day no hurry, the same Haliburtion Lake, eat supper early and go walleye fishing till midnite was the rule, never figured out a good daytime pattern there in 20+ years in that clear water.  Never fished much Musky but my limited experience on Pike says that they really don't feed much in the dark, figuring I wouldn't get up early for them."
476959,lew,2010-06-18 11:32:00,12766,"I've been a very early riser my whole life and always get up between 2 & 4 AM. I used to do alot of serious biking and would leave my home about 3:00 AM, 12 months a year, and ride 20-40 miles before sunrise. I love driving in the early morning darkness and when I'm heading out on a long distance fishing trip I sometimes leave home at 2:00AM  There's not many things nicer than being the only boat on the lake when the sun breaks over the horizon either.  "
476962,fish_fishburn,2010-06-18 12:02:00,1311,"I love to be out very early in the morning. I know I am right on schedule when I'm hooking my boat up and the robins are flying around and its still dark out. I usually have to take the dog cause my buddies want to go at 7 or 8 am. Man I have been on the water 2 or 3 hrs by then. Its the most beautiful time of the day, the air has a fresh smell and the only sound is the birds and hopefully the drag on my reel making music for my ears."
477006,alexcba,2010-06-18 14:36:00,634,"definitely an early riser. when it comes to river fishing for trout i'll normally be in the water knee deep by 530am @ the latest. on lakes theres nothing like watching the sun break thru.. even if the fishing is bad, as long as my best friend is with me then the bite doesn't matter. we've been fishing together since we've been kids and the entertainment value of it alone is awesome.. even after all these years we always have something new to talk about."
477010,fishnsled,2010-06-18 14:48:00,3520,I do like the early morning for many of the same reasons as above. Love watching that sun come up and the call of a loon is the only other sound. The sound of a fishing splashing about is always great at that time of day or anytime really.
477011,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 14:50:00,117,Maybe all us early riser's should go together... And all our buddies who are late riser's go together...  I usually put in 4 hrs before they even get up.
477015,Headhunter,2010-06-18 14:55:00,5703,Up at the crack of noon! HH
477016,alexcba,2010-06-18 14:56:00,634,"lol if your ever lookin for 2 fishing buddies, vince and i are always down.. were good for gas, coffee, and laughs."
477017,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 15:00:00,117, Same here.....
477018,Billy Bob,2010-06-18 15:00:00,5865,"So then, can't all you Canadians get together and pass a law that Timmy's must sell coffee at all the boat launches..."
477019,alexcba,2010-06-18 15:06:00,634,i can only normally do one tims a day on the way to fishing.. i then turn over to the thermos thats full of espresso!!  but thats the euro in me lol.
477020,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 15:12:00,117,I don't do Tim's unless I have too.... I'm a BYOC... Thanks to my wife owning a cafe and pastry shop.
477023,alexcba,2010-06-18 15:13:00,634,woooo that means she must have the hard core pump espresso maker.. BB lets go fishing! LOL
477031,Billy Bob,2010-06-18 16:00:00,5865, I grind my own Starbucks for the ride to the lake but I would pay $10 for a second cup at the launch so it's PIPING HOT while I boat to my hot spot. I even have Timmy's microwave my coffee (in my mug) for 30 seconds...BTW did you know it cheaper at Timmy's if you do bring your own mug.  Bob
477034,Terry,2010-06-18 16:10:00,14456, ditto
477035,Fisherman,2010-06-18 16:10:00,7201,"You need to do some lobbying, I have at least 4 Timmies, 1 Country Style and another No name within 5 minutes of the boat launch. They're open 7/24 except for Xmas and NYR. As for Starpuk*, yech, horrible coffee for a crazy price."
477036,alexcba,2010-06-18 16:13:00,634,"yeah but starbucks are everywhere in the states.. just like our tims.. i personally dont like it either, but i know a few american lads who dont like tims either. lol i knoww... blasphemy!"
477045,Billy Bob,2010-06-18 16:41:00,5865,I like both but I can get Starbuck beans at Sams club...can't buy Timmy beans here......Starabucks is a bit stronger and that's OK with me...  I have a Timmy's one block from my boat garage but none near any of my launches.....
477047,wankerjohn123,2010-06-18 16:55:00,117," Alex, we have to hook up sometime. I'm in Toronto.  Cheers, John"
477074,NAW,2010-06-18 18:40:00,4022,  Never in Barrie!!  I live 5 minutes from the boat launch and i pass by two tims on the way..  Never stop in though..  I'm a thermos man  myself.
477082,Beans,2010-06-18 18:57:00,3339,"My niece's husband used to tell us...""show me a fish I can't catch at noon and I'll get up early with you boys""  We never could...  He is one of a couple of fishermen I have met in my life that seem to have a sixth sense of where the fish are and what they want...When nobody is catching any...they never got skunked..."
