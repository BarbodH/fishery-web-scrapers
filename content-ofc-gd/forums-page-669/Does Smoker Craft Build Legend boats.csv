The plate says that the Manufacturer is Smoker Craft out of New Paris, IN. I am a little confused, is it a Legend or a Smoker...     Anybody?? "
475063,John Bacon,2010-06-12 17:27:00,3277,Legend does not make their own hulls.  They purchase them from other manufactures and add their own trim.  Smokercraft has supplied many of the hulls for Legend boats and continues to do so.
475064,fishinfool,2010-06-12 17:28:00,366," Well then, I guess that solves that mystery! Thanks for the info JohnBacon.  SS"
475066,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-12 17:32:00,10439,I also bought my boat through Legend back in 1991. My hull is made by Fisher. Model SV18-GT and it's a darn fine built hull.
475069,Uncle Buck,2010-06-12 17:44:00,1000,my legend is a smokercraft hull and i had to get the whole bow area re-riveted..  check the HIN #... that'll enable you to cross reference the manufacturer
475070,craigdritchie,2010-06-12 17:48:00,1586,I believe Crestliner has also manufactured hulls for Legend.
475085,fishinfool,2010-06-12 18:13:00,366,Thanks guys for all the replys. This place is a veritable library of knowledge. Gotta like it!!  Stan
475087,danbouck,2010-06-12 18:16:00,4380,I just checked my 08 Legend and the hull was made by Starcraft    Funny how I have never read it and I love starcraft boats.
475096,fishinfool,2010-06-12 18:41:00,366," Hey Dan Yeah, I like Starcraft as well and I also think highly of Smoker Craft. Our neighbor at the cottage had a small aluminum Smoker Craft for as long as I can remember and it was a great little boat. Maybe I should ask for more money. lol"
475109,craigdritchie,2010-06-12 19:35:00,1586,"Starcraft, Sylvan and Smoker Craft are all the same boat .... built in the same plant by the same staff."
475214,NANUK,2010-06-13 03:48:00,797," As far as I knowm, Crestliner never made hulls for Legend boats, however they do make hulls for Triton's aluminum boats."
475217,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-06-13 03:59:00,1107,I wouldn't say they are the same boat they may be built in the same plant but so is a corolla and a lexus RX 350. Starcraft are much nicer fit and finish than the other 2 from what I have seen but all 3 are nice boats for the money.
477061,ohhenrygsr,2010-06-18 17:59:00,947,"Hey Guys just to clear things up.  When Legend first started in the boating industry back in 84.  They started with Fiberglass Hulls.  Then in 1990 they had Crestliner built there hulls for them but it was a bad idea.  Then in 1992 Legend had their hulls built in the Star craft Facility which was about 20 miles away from the Smoker Craft building which Smoker craft bought out Star Craft.  Now you will find SmokerCraft builds Starcraft, Smoker Craft and Sylvan products out of there plant in Indiana.  Legend Boats hulls are built in the same plant as SmokerCraft but we design our boats, our layouts and our specs.  What's great is the warranty of our boats.  Since our head office is in Sudbury, Whitefish (Duhamel & Dewar) if there was ever a hull issue or any issue with a Legend it's taken care at either the Corporate Store in Barrie or our head office."
