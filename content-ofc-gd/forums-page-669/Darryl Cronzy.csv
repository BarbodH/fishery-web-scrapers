476601,Fishnwire,2010-06-16 23:50:00,983,"If I was a man a Darryl's carriage, I don't think I'd draw attention to the fact that I make a pig out of myself every time I go fishing.  I don't watch his show partly because it turns me off to see him fill his live well, and then his face, every single episode.  I hate to think about the fish he keeps when the camera is not rolling.  Given the choice between harvesting an important breeder or doing without his mandatory shore lunch, I’m fairly certain I know what the big guy would do. - He’s just not the kind of fisherman I’d invite in my boat, so why would I watch his show?"
476607,Terry,2010-06-17 00:09:00,14456,"well he only keeps his legal limit  the MNR has those limits in place based on people taking their limit  he follows the rules, and by law he eats what he keeps, who am I to try to impose my morals on someone else who is fishing within the law..  also if no one ate fish I know they would make fishing illegal  C&R is important but so is eating them"
476611,irishfield,2010-06-17 00:11:00,26272,Edazakery Terry! Darryl'd be welcome in my boat any time he wanted to get out ! I have a thing for crusty old buggers... why I hang out here...
476632,Cookslav,2010-06-17 01:08:00,1457, Give that Man cigar! 
476639,TSM,2010-06-17 01:21:00,5,"I think Cronzy's great! I had the pleasure of attending one of his shows here in Ottawa several years ago. He made an important point which I think makes a lot of sense. You can raise a rainbow trout in a sewer, but would you want to eat it? If people eat fish, they'll be more concious of where it comes from. I have to admit that for our shore lunches, we use lard instead of the ""healthier"" oils out there. It does make a difference, IMO! We certainly don't do this year round, but for a few shore lunches each summer, why not!"
476700,bigugli,2010-06-17 04:33:00,6138,"Lrts face facts. Chronzy is no different than at least half the members on the board. Some of us are more than a little crusty, rotund or opinionated.     He's just got it all in the one package. I'd be happy to spare a plate for him any day."
476720,pikehunter,2010-06-17 10:31:00,1659, Welcome aboard anytime.
476760,charlesn,2010-06-17 13:44:00,551," If only he, as a tv personality, could live up to this as well.  Telling people to throw rocks at bass boats and bass fishermen is about the most idiotic thing I've ever heard from a tv personality.  Far worse, in my opinion, than rehooking a whitefish or whatever for the camera.  I don't care how you feel about tournament fishermen or bass fishermen, if you advocate throwing rocks at them (or otherwise endangering them or their passengers) - then you are a complete and utter idiot.  PERIOD.  Charles"
476762,Headhunter,2010-06-17 13:57:00,5703,People in glass boats should not throw rocks! HH
476798,Terry,2010-06-17 16:31:00,14456, LOL
476802,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-17 17:11:00,0,  He sure does. We used one of them and cooked an Atlantic up last week. Good stuff for sure. Lookin forward to the next one.  Thanks Darryl
475437,addymark,2010-06-13 23:47:00,69,"I always enjoy watching Chronzy's show, and I can't help to think that if Don Cherry got into fishing rather than hockey, he would be Darryl Cronzy.  One thing that kills me every show is when he does his recipe bit.  This morning I saw him pour a cup of melted butter on fish, potatoes, and onions.  ""He took a bite and said no calories, no cholestorol.  Don't worry about clogging those arteries and all that.""  didn't he have a heart attack??  and even if he didn't, his nutritional advice, although hilarious is not accurate"

475442,denisk,2010-06-13 23:59:00,163,Shore lunch is the best part of his show.
475444,irishfield,2010-06-14 00:04:00,26272, It sure is Denis and what fishing was intended to be all about!
475474,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-14 01:12:00,932,I think the rants are clearly the best part of his show.  I don't think the Cronz would last too long on these boards without a banning mind you . . .
475476,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-14 01:14:00,2690,"The shows we are watching now were all done, prior to his heart attack.  Love him or hate him, he has never been afraid to speak his mind and push some buttons with our ministry."
475479,Paully,2010-06-14 01:15:00,712,...yum yum
475496,Toronto_Angler,2010-06-14 02:14:00,698, Totally agree!
475501,Swan_Dive,2010-06-14 02:29:00,46,The guy is awsome but he put two cups of salt in his last recipe!!  I always thought chefs on the food network put a lot of salt on their food but TWO CUPS!  Guys has a great show and I love listening to his rants but don't think I'll be taking any of his recipes down any time soon
475583,canadadude,2010-06-14 14:40:00,769,"I don't think Darryl is on his same old diet,he had his big scare last fall,hopfully he's eating alittle healthier,it would be a huge loss the fishing world ever lost the cronz"
475686,Cookslav,2010-06-14 18:50:00,1457," I'm assuming it was a Gravlax recipe? Gravlax fish is cured in salt/sugar usually in a 50/50 ratio...very tasty Not great for the heart but after you remove the salt/sugar, and slice....dude its awesome  I sometimes gravlax salmon, or Steelhead fillets for 4-5 days until firm, rinse then marinate in pure Maple Syrup for 3 days, pat dry and hit the cold smoker for 6 hours. Its to die for brother, and well worth the Heart attack LOL!"
475694,Roy,2010-06-14 19:19:00,13728," I hear ya Cookslav. I usually make it a couple of times a year. I always make lots for large gatherings but there's never any leftover. 4-5 days you say then 3 more days in maple syrup??? I only marinate mine for 48 hours or so in sugar, salt, cracked pepper (lots) and bunches of fresh dill some lemon slices and very little cognac."
475770,Cookslav,2010-06-14 23:04:00,1457,"Oh ya... I like it when its firm and dry. I'll flip it an re-apply the gravlax once a day just to ensure its FULLY cured. Then a quick pat dry to remove the granulars, and 3 days in Maple to sweeten it up.  You could shave the time if your fillets are thinner I suppose? I try to use a good 1.5' or 2"" fillet when ever I can I should mention that useing this method, and time frame you can expect your fillet to shrink Litterally to half it's size.  I love it! I just find the 4 day Salt/sugar cure makes a full penetration, and seasons the center of the meat perfectly. The 3 days in Maple pulls a lot of the ""salty"" out, but leaves the texture intact, and just seems to balance the flavor of salt, and smoke perfectly when done. I prefer an Alderwood smoke as well, but Apple is nice when Alder is not available.  I slice it up and serve it with Corn shoots, pea tedrils, cilantro sprouts, and drizzel it with lemon/chili infused olive oil and finish it with orange balsamic reduction, and lumpfish caviar As an appetizer in my restaurant....its killer!  But I agree with your method.... A strait up Gravlax with dill, onions, and standard pickling spice Sliced with fresh lemon...Oh my that is good stuff as well!  Cheers,"

475813,bigugli,2010-06-15 00:32:00,6138,Whatsa matter Wayne. No numnums? I just finished a plate of perch fillets and fresh asparagarus tips fried with fresf pulled garlic and butter. Life is good
475815,addymark,2010-06-15 00:37:00,69,    this sounded dee-lish!
475818,highdrifter,2010-06-15 00:42:00,2534,Haah!  I thought he only used shortening..  He does seem to be coming around though.  I've actually caught myself sitting through a whole episode..  Maybe he hired a PR consultant..
475821,Spiel,2010-06-15 00:46:00,9065,"Seems Daryl is doing okay, I saw this in the comment section of the TO Sun this morning.   Young teachers’ dilemma  Re “Union still hysterical over Harris” (Christina Blizzard, June 11): Elementary Teachers’ Federation President Sam Hammond should look in the mirror and see the real enemy of our school kids today. It’s time to get off Mike Harris’ back and address the real problem. Young people graduate with a teaching degree and have no jobs because the Teachers’ Federation guaranteed retirees a cushy pension — and allows them to fill in as supply teachers while new teachers are left out in the cold with their dreams shattered. Too bad Harris didn’t rein in the teachers’ unions.  Darryl Choronzey  Owen Sound   "
475906,Stern Rules,2010-06-15 06:55:00,342,I agree. It would be a huge loss.
