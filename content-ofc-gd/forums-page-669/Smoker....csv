476786,ehg,2010-06-17 15:22:00,2666,That smoker is what we use for catering. You could easily feed 100 people at a time with meats from all that space. Your family and neighbours are lucky folks

476523,Roy,2010-06-16 20:47:00,13728,for more smoke I wet my wood...as it were.....

Pipe in a stripe of cream cheese (mix some seasonings in there too)....   Add a Lil' Smokey (cocktail sausage - I cut them in half)...   Wrap in bacon....   Put them on the smoker (for about an hour)...   Done.... and enjoy!!!   And be careful.... they are very adictive!!  Burt"

476606,GBW,2010-06-17 00:07:00,8460,"Roy is as sharp as a hook I tell ya...  Burt, those look great!  Gerritt, I will post when I have time for my first smoke.  shan&jay, you may want to get *can't think of the name of the product right now* to seal the door better.  I know I am on my gas one.  Too much smoke is getting out and I have to switch to Apple chuncks rather then chips."
476614,GBW,2010-06-17 00:19:00,8460,"Oh, it's a ""fireplace door seal"" type of product you want to get more heat and less lost smoke."
476616,Burtess,2010-06-17 00:30:00,901,"I don't know what it is like with the electric or gas smokers, but with the Weber... less smoke is sometimes more...  I use maybe 2 small fist sized chunks of wood (usually cherry or oak/fruit wood) for the entire process.  Once the Weber is up and running stable, you really don't see any smoke coming out the top, just a thin, bluish vapour.  You don't generally want to be adding smoke wood all the time as you can easily overpower some meats (especially fowl).  This is ""hot smoking"" or BBQ'ing though.... 220-250F.  Although I routinely do pork shoulder and ribs above this temperature with fantastic results.  Burt"

474339,Hooked,2010-06-10 04:39:00,891,"  Sure you would be able to use Cherry, Pecan.....they have several different flavoured pellets.  $20-22/bag at the Home Hardware in Stoney Creek.  Apparently good for 20 hours of cooking for each bag.  They also sell the Traeger.  The guy with the goatee there, I think he owns it, is very knowledgeable about it too.  I would of bought it if I didn't have so many other things to work on around the house here, stupid house."

The BGE gets hotter for steak, it can sustain lower temps for longer periods of time (with the use of the BBQ Guru) and uses much less charcoal than the WSMC.

I have seen a lot of the bbq/smokers but I prefer to have 2 seperate pieces.  It comes down to a preference thing.  I found that what I liked in a smoker and what I liked in a bbq were pretty different so I split the difference.  I ended up making a smoker for less than $100.  PM me if you want some details on how to make.  Either way you go, nothing is better than slow smoked pork of beef brisket.   mmmmm now I'm hungry and it's not even 8:30"
