I would appreciate a recommendation, by some one that has been treated by the dealer before...  Motor runs good, but I would like to get a tune-up done on it  Thanks guys"
477275,Fisherman,2010-06-19 10:56:00,7201,How old is the motor? Approximately how many hours?
477313,spoon,2010-06-19 13:20:00,74,"Its a 1998, and I would have to say below 300 working hours.."
477323,Fisherman,2010-06-19 14:24:00,7201,"I can only say beware of the one dealer n/w of Barrie. I'm sure there'll be a couple of others that can point you in the right direction.  Oil change, lower unit, plugs, fuel filter valve lash, water pump impeller and thats about it."
477329,scugpg,2010-06-19 14:56:00,1373,Change the oil filter if it has one as well. Some of them are hidden.
