470412,Rice Laker,2010-05-28 03:11:00,24,"This Pet Fish question reminded me of the following true story:  A  man was stopped by a Conservation Officer in Northern Algonquin Park recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing The C.O. asked the man, ""Do you have a license to catch those fish?"" The man replied to the C.O., ""No, sir. These are my pet fish.""  ""Pet fish?!"" the C.O. replied. ""Yes, sir, every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home.""  ""That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!""  The man looked at the C.O. for a moment, and then said, ""Here, I'll show you. It really works.""  ""O.K. I've GOT to see this!"" The C.O. was curious.  The man poured the fish in to the river and stood and waited. After several minutes, the C.O. turned to the man and said, ""Well?""  ""Well, what?"" the man responded.  ""When are you going to call them back?"" the C.O. prompted.  ""Call who back?"" the man asked.  ""The FISH""  ""What fish?"" the man asked..........."
470419,GoneFishin,2010-05-28 03:47:00,349," I can second that! I remember fishing a stubborn brown. After spooking her I found a cray fish and it was gone before it made it 4inches from the top of the water!  I love coming back to stubborn fish, good luck hope yeah get him."
470509,fish_finder,2010-05-28 15:01:00,370," Thats typical of the big buggers.  But, hanging out at that hole during dawn or dusk hours you may actually see him in the middle of the stream feeding on bugs and such.  When the opportunity arises and he sees a bigger meal aka mouse, frog, minnow...he'll obviously slam them as they are worth much more energy for the amount of energy that he needs to exert.  Nymphs and surface flies probably get eaten quite a bit as well, but big fish need big meals...thats how they got that way to begin with!  With your mouse and frog lures, look for some deer hair flies/lures.  Mouse and frog flies are big and probably heavy enough to cast with your spinning gear.  Especially once they are a little wet.  With the mouse, try to cast it downstream and across from you, then try to guide it across the stream and slightly towards you.  A mouse would have trouble swimming upstream if there is any current, so pulling it across the stream makes is look like it is struggling with the current.  Cast the frog onto the beaver lodge and twitch it off into the water just beside it."
470517,Toronto_Angler,2010-05-28 15:41:00,698, HAHAHA! Good one!
470622,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-29 00:11:00,932,"A few updates:  1)  I was there again today and saw the same old bugger brown chase my ugly duckling chub-coloured sinking crankbait.  I've learned a few things about him - he's not really feeding in these hours, but he's definitely territorial all day long.  He's simply chasing other fish away from his house.  2) I traveled upstream after I bid adieux for another day to my buddy in the beaver lodge and found another old pesky brown.  I was fishing a small panther martin silver spinner.  It was sunny, but shaded, and this was a beaver lodge near a rock pile.  I cast for 10 minutes at the beaver lodge, caught a chub.  I kept casting and then clouds took over the sky.  On the first cast during overcast conditions, the brown hit the spinner and I landed it.  Not as big as my pet, but around 20 inches and built like a Wilson Football.  I was mid-river with rod in hand and couldn't get a photo, so he went back to be caught by me another day.  You could tell by its appearance that it was an older fish.  These guys will clearly hit spinners.  Seems to me it was an annoyance strike."
470623,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-29 00:16:00,932," Yeah, that seems like a good way to fish the terrestrials.  The (weedless) frog on the lodge is a good approach.  I snapped a few pictures of frogs today on the water and I'll try to match to the best of my ability.  I'm still waiting for the right hours to fish the mouse.  I'm more willing to fish the frog at any time.  I'm really looking forward to fishing this guy during feeding hours.  Re:  Crayfish.  I'll try the crayfish as well with this guy.  He's going to hit something . . . he already hit a spinner.  I agree that fish this size are looking for a meal, and a crayfish is definitely a meal.  Thanks for the posts."
470862,BillM,2010-05-30 00:58:00,17367,Have you put an unweighted nightcrawler past his nose?
471296,torco,2010-05-31 15:08:00,656,Sounds like you have had some success in getting him to bite. I'd say make sure your hooks are razor sharp.  Also if you get the flyrod out a nice sized streamer could produce a strike.

471319,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-31 16:26:00,932," I fly fish (extremely poorly granted, as I just started), but the two spots I've found in this location that are holding BIG browns (22"" and beyond) are next to impossible to properly present a fly at if the fish are holding to their cover.  Regardless, my friend Timmeh, was with me when I got the 20-22"" and he said even before I got it that you couldn't really present a fly properly in this fishes home.  The 22"" fish I caught on Friday night was back on the prowl though last night and he was just rising and eating flies the entire time I was there.  I actually saw the bugger swim up to the exact lure I caught him with on Friday and laugh at it.  I don't think I'll get him on that little panther martin again.  I'd say fly-fishing is the best way to fish for browns only when conditions permit."
473541,Nipfisher,2010-06-08 02:46:00,2449,Update??????
473574,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-08 04:28:00,932," I've fished his hole 3 more times since posting.  I saw him once (chased a chub minnow imitation out of his area), once was abandoned due to a mosquito convention and no bug spray, and once he was a no show.  I haven't got the opportunity to properly fish him in awhile and will be going after him again this week."
476703,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-17 04:57:00,932,"UPDATE:  Torco and I met up tonight and went to fish @ the same spot where this fish lives.  He was rising and as always there were no other fish in his area.  I got fed up with running a lure by his face and decided it was perfect time for the mouse that many of you suggested.  It was windy, overcast, and it had just briefly rained  I tied it on, put it into the current, let it drift over top of the general area the fish was rising in, and then skittered it across the top of the water.  It looked extremely lifelike (from the surface - the hook underneath probably doesn't look that lifelike).  4-5 casts and nothing.  Next cast, the surface explodes under my mouse, water is splashing, and due to over-excitement I pull the mouse away too soon  After a profanity or two and two in-vain casts, we moved upstream.  Nice to see the beast is still around after having not targeted him in a few weeks."
476705,alexcba,2010-06-17 05:27:00,634,"1"" tube jig bro, earthy tone.. he'll be on the hook in a second."
476725,fish_finder,2010-06-17 11:14:00,370," Yeah Buddy!!  I bet you'll get him next time man!  Most times when a brown grabs something like that, he'll do the work in hooking himself as he'll smash the lure and turn away from you with it in its mouth."
476726,wallacio,2010-06-17 11:19:00,475,"Ah - so close!   Have you tried a large streamer yet?  When I say large, I'm talking about at least 5-6""...giant Browns can't resist them.   Anything that moves naturally in the water like a Zonker pattern in olive, brown, black and even white should do the trick."
476740,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-17 12:39:00,932," Yeah, it was pretty intense (although brief).  He approached it from the side and I could see him in a ""U"" shape.  I've heard that this doesn't necessarily mean they are about to hit your presentation, and that sometimes it means they have checked it out and are swimming away.  Regardless, in this situation, judging by the direction he approached from, and the amount of commotion it caused, it was most certainly a strike.  Also Fish Finder - sidenote - I checked out that site in your signature.  It looks really good so I signed up!  Cheers, Ryan"

469930,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 18:09:00,932,"Hello All,  I've been playing cat & mouse with a huge (river) brown trout for the past month or so now.  Here's a bit of background on my pet brown:  - He is 24-28 Inches. - He is very fat. - He lives in (or around) a beaver lodge. - He lives in the depths close to fast water. - His general area often has so many minnows that they are piled 5-6 baitfish deep in the water column. - He is not very popular with other fish, as his area seems devoid of smaller fish (Haha, I wonder why)  My three semi-successful experiences with this fish to this point (on 3/6 trips he made appearances): Please Note - All three sightings happened in DAYLIGHT hours (between 10:00am and 6:00pm)  - My first experience was towards the end of april when he attacked a vibrax 1 spinner - silver, dressed.  Line - 6lb test, leader 2lb fluorocarbon.  I had him on for roughly 30 seconds when he shook the hook.  He was taking line.  Here I saw him bent in half fighting the lure.  - My second experience was a few weeks ago.  He attacked a silver EGB spoon with french swivel but just knocked it and returned home.  Here I saw him head first.  Same line setup.  - My third experience was today when I enticed him to follow a F5 Silver Rapala.  I was using 6 Lb green mono.  I have no doubt he tracked the lure for some time because he was sighted relatively far from home.  He decided to not take the Floating Rap in the 30 degree weather.  Today is when I really truly understood how big this fish actually is.  I saw his entire length and girth.  A true trophy.  Unsuccessful presentations to this point:  1) Float-Fishing Nymphs 2) Fishing with worms 3) Fishing with a jigged Gulp Alive minnow 4) Fishing a small Mepps Syclops 5) Fishing a ""Little Wolf"" Spoon  I fully intend on catching this fellow in the near future.  He will be returned to fight another day after I successfully manage to land him..  So I ask you folks:  how would you go about landing this great brown?  I look forward to your input!"

469944,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 18:32:00,932, Hey Dan!  I've been thinking this may be a good strategy as well.  I think I would target anytime of day either during a heavy rain or shortly after a rainfall.  Would you cast onto the opposite shore and twitch it into the water and let it proceed right through the trout's house?
469946,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 18:36:00,932," There are definitely lots of chubs present, but I fear the float would make the fish even more skittish.  Would you run it on a small hook with a fluoro leader?  With this presentation again I think that it would be best presented during a rainfall or shortly after."
469947,MJL,2010-05-26 18:46:00,2427,"Awesome thread…I too am also on a quest for redemption.  I’ve also tried just about everything you tried except for the Mepps Syclops. So far the only things I’ve been getting resident browns on are spinners and worms with the odd one coming to roe (accidental catch when I’m fishing for steelhead).  I’ve tried my collection of Kwikfish & Flatfish, smaller Rapalas and various streamer flies.  Some things I’m planning to try (mind you there are no rules against live bait or the use of treble hooks where I fish):  - Top water bass lures (to simulate mice and frogs)…I have a few Rapala skitter pops so I may try those.  - Drifting medium sized shiners below a float or bottom bouncing them  - I’ve read that big browns drop their guard when there’s a hatch of giant mayflies – Hexagenia Limbata (I’m not sure if the river I fish has them or not)…Or wait for a hatch of grasshoppers later in summer and break out the fly gear…After Sunday night, I’m sure my 8wt isn’t too heavy for some of the fish lurking in the river  In any case, I’ll be returning at night…My big browns (almost all migratories off the pier or estuary) as well as some of the bigger resident fish I’ve hooked into came at night.  Hopefully before this weekend, I can pick up a bigger net.LOL  I'll also be tying up some hair mice on the vice sometime this week if I have time to spin them"
469948,wallacio,2010-05-26 18:52:00,475,"Definitely good suggestions so far (a mouse pattern, live minnow under a float).  You will likely have the most success (regardless of bait/lure) by changing the time of day that you try to fool this wise old fish as large Browns primarily feed at night.   I'm personally not a big fan of fumbling around in the dark (especially with a fly rod) but in many cases they'll start to become active just before dark.   I've taken all of my largest Browns an hour or two before dusk so give it a try.  One last thing, keep an eye on water temperatures as we get into July and August especially if we keep getting this type of weather.   I personally stop fishing for Trout when the water is beyond 65C or so and when it is that high it's best to fight fish quickly and don't take pictures so the fish isn't out of the water for long (which is pretty hard to resist when you get a big one).  Good luck!"
469949,blaque,2010-05-26 18:56:00,2419,"I would try something live on a naturally bouyant rig.....bare bones...meaning NO split shot or any kind of weight.  Just let the weight of a worm for example take itself down naturally and slowly.  I dont know how far you have to cast your presentation but with light enough line a worms weight will get you a good distance.  If hes in faster water, cast WAY ahead of him so that your bait is in the strike zone by the time it reaches the fish.  This is pretty stealth and natural and sometimes thats all you need to entice.  Try this with all sorts of baits........worms, slugs, caterpillars etc.  The downfall of this all is he may take it deep as you wont be able to keep a tightline on the weightless natural presentation"
469957,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 20:02:00,932," Thanks for the post Wallacio.  I've tried for this fish at dusk and had ZERO success.  He could have been off on those three occasions, but I've had him on twice during high daylight hours and I ALMOST had him on today.  I realize it is rare, but perhaps he doesn't mind gorging during the day.  My best days so far fishing browns this year have been at 8am or so with overcast skies.  Unfortunately, I have to hit this particular spot at that hour.  When Bass come into season, I slow-down or completely stop fishing for Browns.  That's my general rule of thumb."
469960,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 20:17:00,932," Hey MJL!  I figured you'd reply to this thread - you always have great trout reports of your own and I guessed the title would entice you hahaha.  Glad you liked it.  I might keep it alive as long as he keeps showing himself (or in the event of me actually landing him).  This guy will most certainly be well worth the effort and the planning - that's half the fun.  I'm going to try him rotationally as far as daylight goes.  Today was bright morning and he showed himself.  Next efforts will be at dusk and after dark.  ASAP I am going to try him in the morning - ideally overcast.  I also have a fly rod but am nowhere near adept enough to land this guy on a fly.  I'm going to bring a wide menu for him next time.  Chub, Shiner, Mouse (fake for starters), and the items that have interested him previously.  I've read reports of browns that are caught with 8+ moles in their stomachs after a rainfall - gives some more credence to the rodent route.  I agree with the previous bare bones approach as well - no split shots, nothing that can interfere for the time being.  We'll see (but keep the ideas coming folks - not a bad reference for this fellow or other big old browns)."
469963,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-26 20:23:00,932," He's in a deep pool near or in a beaver lodge at the end of fast water (but the pool maintains some current).  It is almost unapproachable from the near side, so you have to be across stream.  It's a tricky spot but not the trickiest spot.  When I am feeling ninja-like, I will approach him from the near side and sit for 20-30 minutes and then I'll start working him."

Seriously though, the mouse pattern at dusk is a great idea, as would be a frog pattern too.  I've found with bigger fish, if they chase your fly/lure, they'll usually only do it once an outting as they know somethings up when it suddenly disappears from the water.  If you know exactly where he usually hangs out, spend an hour just watching the water to see what he's actually feeding on.  Its a tough thing to just sit and watch, but it just might pay off in the end for ya!  It has for me."

I'm guessing natural?...switch it up and toss a bright pink or orange xrap...twitch a jointed rap on the surface  failing the reaction strike I would either dead drift, with no weight, any of the baits mentioned above....red wiggler and then a dace or chub would be my top 2 picks....or try still fishing on bottom using a slip sinker rig....  failing all of that, I'd fish for her early am (4-8am) or night fishing  be careful of your profile and where your shadow falls too, when you're fishing during daylight....don't be blowing a puff of smoke over the water, stand a few extra feet back from the water....crouch or rest on your knees, use the natural foliage to blend in your profile as much as possible   I had a very similar story with a musky in college, went on for 4 yrs...had her on a few times, never landed, stole at least half a dozen smallies/eyes on me when I was fighting them in....I always saw her in a specific area, deepest water in that section of river...so that's where I fished for her and had many sightings but only occasional action from her....I eventually began to realize that this area was probably her resting area....resting in the shallow, warm edges of the pool to increase her metabolism, but able to sneak away into deep water at any sign of danger...I devised a new game plan and started looking for feeding areas that were close by....I never landed her as I graduated school and moved away...but following summer(5th season since I first saw her) my buddy landed her....plowing a 13"" smallmouth patterned believer through the rocks in 2-3' of water 100 yards away from my spot....56.5"" but no girth measurement    I know exactly how you feel....good luck and post some pics when you land her..."

470082,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 03:24:00,932," On the three times I have seen this fish  1) When I had him on the spinner it was the only time I saw him. 2) When I had him knock the EGB it was the only time I saw him 3) Today, when he chased my rap, it was the only time I saw him.  You only get one chance with this guy, and not even one sighting per trip.  I don't suspect he leaves home for everything, all the time.  I bought 4 mouse lures tonight of varying sizes and colours.  I'll fish them when the conditions permit.  I think it is something good to have in the tackle box.  I almost stepped on two frogs when I was approaching him today - I'll need a gentle presentation without a whole lot of metal.  I'm going to watch him.  I've considered doing it before, but took the ""Ill just fish for him approach.""  I'll probably fish for him a few more times first"

I just am not sure how many spinners this fish is going to hit.  Re:  Bait floating on cedar.
