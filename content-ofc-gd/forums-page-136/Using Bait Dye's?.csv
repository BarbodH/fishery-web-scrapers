959685,manitoubass2,2016-02-25 22:12:00,11391,What in the???
959691,John Bacon,2016-02-25 23:01:00,3277,"How many dyed minnows would it have to eat to look like that?Is that your photo?  Or, something that you pulled off the internet?"

959721,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 00:57:00,11391,Im ignorant on this.   People really dye minnows??
959724,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-26 01:07:00,10439,Yup!!!  http://pro-cure.com/store/bait-scent-products/bait-dyes.html  http://www.viciousbaitdye.com/  
959725,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 01:10:00,11391,"Im baffled, i stop at frozen shiners"
959727,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 01:13:00,11391,Would food colouring suffice?  Anyhow this imo is just silly
959728,Grimace,2016-02-26 01:21:00,2020,"I think it is just food colouring in those bait dyes.  If it is it's harmless.   My kid's tongue goes green after having a lollipop.  No big deal.  If I could hazard a guess someone had the dyed water in a bucket of bait, dumped er down the hole.  Some pike came a long and had a buffet of dead dyed minnows and got caught the next day or shortly after.  I could be totally wrong but that is my guess first off.  If that pike was caught a few days later it could be normal again."
959731,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 01:26:00,11391,Well if it consumed dyed bait it sure ate alot lol.  But yeah food colouring is relatively harmless.  Next up bait dipped in mountain dew
959732,Grimace,2016-02-26 01:28:00,2020,I just read a little bit in the bait dye how it works section.  Says it lasts for days.  Seems they went a little over the top with this.  I bet food colouring in the bucket would suffice.  only last a bit but i bet it would outlast the minnow
959735,Fish Farmer,2016-02-26 01:45:00,2234,My pee is that color on St. Patty's Day I knew there was a reason I don't eat Pike Drifter that just doesn't look like good eats
959769,John Bacon,2016-02-26 04:43:00,3277, Pulled off an ice fishing FB group I belong to.  I wonder if someone dumped dye down the pikes throat.  I can't imagine it getting that much colour from eating a few dyed minnows.
959773,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 06:35:00,11391,Looks like the old guy on the trailer park boys when he filled up a swimming pool with liquor
959805,mike rousseau,2016-02-26 13:40:00,4661,"I've used the ""markers"" to color your minnows  It basically only colors the slime on the minnow so after a short time in the river the color is gone"
959829,G.mech,2016-02-26 16:13:00,830,Something's a little fishy with that picture & I don't mean the pike....
959838,NANUK,2016-02-26 17:05:00,797,If that picture is real I would say that fish ate something other than just dyed bait.
959845,netminder,2016-02-26 17:29:00,514,Looks like it was caught just in time. In a couple years it would have grown into a teenage mutant ninja pike.
