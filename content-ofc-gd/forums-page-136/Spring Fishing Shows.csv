Nope they insist there is a show starting next Thursday. I can't find one. Any idea if there is an upcoming fishing show? Maybe they started the weekend a few hours early, in fact I know they did."
959886,John Bacon,2016-02-26 21:56:00,3277,"The Hamilton show starts next Friday.  http://www.ontarioboatshows.com/   Plus there is still the Toronto Sportsman Show starting on March 16th.  I am looking forward to seeing the show in its new location.  There are also a few other smaller shows in St Catherines, Bowmanville, Trenton, Belleville, and one in Toronto on various dates.  Most of these are tackle swaps so I wouldn't expect to see any boats.  The St Catherines Show is tomorrow; I think the location has changed though.  "
959890,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-26 22:16:00,8243,That's the show they are talking about. Hamilton is even better than schlepping all the way to T.O. and back. We are only 40 minutes from the Airport. Fantastic. Thanks so muchJohn. I might need to wear my OFC name tag. Hope to see a few members there.

But the Toronto Sportsman Show has moved to that location for this year.  It will be there in about three weeks.

We did print off a handful just so we'd have something for sales and to show people but don't have any for the general public. All we have right now is a digital version of the premier issue which you can get here:  http://www.canadafishingguide.net/magazine/  I'm pretty sure we'll be printing the mag this year and we're all excited about that!"
