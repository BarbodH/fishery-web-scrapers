959977,Canuck,2016-02-27 13:57:00,491,"The Lords and Ladies of the Liberal Party are operating like they are governing in the feudal system of the 1700's.  Such a sense of entitlement.  Hey Liberal voters, pay attention to my words -- next election, you need to ensure you understand the ENTIRE Liberal platform, fundamentals and history, not just the trinkets and bobbles they trot out in front of you and how cute the leader is.   Its all well and good that we laugh a bit and make jokes about what they are doing like they are someone else's problem. They are spending your money, not their money.  Mark my words, Justin Turtle is going to go down in history as one of the weakest and worst Prime Ministers of all time.   He is already letting the rest of the Liberal MP's have their way with this 20% boost in their budgets.  Its only the beginning. And keep in mind this is only what we have visibility on.  What other schemes are going on in the back rooms that we don't know about?"
