959103,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-23 19:19:00,937,My first time fishing Port Dalhousie and first time bottom bouncing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRKargi6-MQ&feature=youtu.be
959106,BillM,2016-02-23 19:27:00,17367,Locals didn't toss you off the pier?  lol.  What a gong show that place can be.  Nice fish!
959129,huzzsaba,2016-02-23 21:00:00,884,Nice!  Curious what type of weight were you using and how heavy?
959134,AKRISONER,2016-02-23 21:07:00,5558,every time you had something on i half expected you to have the 15 guys that stand on the last 5 feet of the piers fishing gear on the end of your line...at least you had much better weather than i did when i fished it over the christmas holidays this year. Nice fish.
959138,misfish,2016-02-23 21:23:00,29133,"Nice fish.  Early 80,s, I use to fish over at that factory. If you got there at 5 am, you were late, no spot. LOL"
959141,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-23 21:38:00,8243,"Good going Pump. We used to fish there every spring and fall until yes it became a Gong Show. We stopped after cars from NY, Ohio and Michigan were double parked in the lots and streets. Hopefully they cleaned up the bottom somehow because snags bouncing bottom were steady, one after another. That gets tiring real fast. The only way to fish was casting F-10's and lighter spoons. At least there were 2 Ballets that way then to lick your wounds after a day of snags and dealing with idiots.  Nice fish."
959146,davey buoy,2016-02-23 22:04:00,5505,Nicely done ! beauty fish !!
959149,Steve,2016-02-23 22:25:00,2075,good stuff.  dragging that ditch always produces through the winter.
959219,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-24 02:02:00,937,"I thought the crowds was gonna be a lot worse but it was manageable.  I guess it was a slow day for people.  I believe I was using a 1oz bell sinker with a carp quick change link like this... This way if I snagged, I would only loose my sinker and I can quickly add another one.  "
959556,niagara jeep,2016-02-25 13:22:00,20,Try float fishing it......guys that fish it everyday says it doesn't work tho haha
959559,AKRISONER,2016-02-25 13:55:00,5558,"crankbaits?,,,,just saying"
959571,Steve,2016-02-25 14:32:00,2075,"it all works...  your fishing a ditch that literally is coated with zombie fish on the bottom....  if I fish the lake and can't catch a fish, I'll simply troll my way up dalhousie from the lake to the ramp. I've NEVER not caught a fish doing that....a simple little crank and away I go....  your fishing a man made trough that is literally full of fish year around.....  3 way, spoons, cranks, floating, etc, etc, etc....it all works.  dalhousie is not hard fishing...."

Where did you pick those quick links up at? Never seen that style around here, with the raised end."

I am confused as to how this allows you to only lose your weight?  how does the weight slip off of that clip?"
959659,BillM,2016-02-25 18:55:00,17367,"It doesn't slip off, it breaks.  But he simply attaches a new weight without having to redo his entire rig.  No real difference between that at a 3-way swivel."
959662,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-25 19:20:00,937,"They can be found where you can find carp rigs but I bought mine at Sail.  I use them with the 3 way swivel, I never had to re-tie when I snagged, just added a new weight to that clip.  When the sinker snags on the bottom, I just pull my line and the bottom of  the clip will straighten out and the sinker slides off the clip"

959674,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-25 20:56:00,937,The clip is plastic so it will bend easy and will bend back to its shape
959744,OhioFisherman,2016-02-26 02:52:00,6623,Thanks for that link Pump!
