It's absolutely awesome reading the same folks, 10 years later, stating ""although I don't smoke it, I don't see what is wrong with it""....  Amazing.  And it occurred simply by discussing it.

959240,Canuck,2016-02-24 03:15:00,491,"That was not my point. Mainstream Muslims are not bombing us. ISIL and el Qaeda are.  And they are doing it, not to avenge the crusades (which by the way Christianity left behind centuries ago). They are very clearly working to cleanse the world of infidels, starting in the Caliphate and then you think they will stop? It's not about oil it's about religion. There ARE many in the Middle East that oppose the west for meddling in their affairs for the sake of oil. And I don't disagree that there is a lot of truth to that. But that is not what ISIl is fighting for. Or el Qaeda or the Taliban."
959257,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 03:58:00,11391, Hillary clinton even admitted it(as secretary of state nonetheless) but hey...   Isis/isil has nothing to do with western powers/influence and funding  https://youtu.be/PJLR1LhxiN0
959258,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 04:06:00,11391,"Your correct. They have ideoligies they wish to pursue.  But they can only pursue that with the protection, funding, politics of the west.  This is your new boogie man"
959260,Dutch01,2016-02-24 04:12:00,1431,"Maybe some of you don't know any Muslims. I live in a multicultural city. I know a number of great people who are Muslims. They don't hate me or want to chop my head off. They bring homemade Samosas to the office and we break bread in the lunch room and talk about fishing, the Leafs, or whatever. These people represent mainstream Muslims, NOT ISIS.  ISIS is a rag tag group of 50,000 fighters at best. The generous estimate of 250,000 I gave in my previous comment above in this thread includes farmers, women, maybe some children and even goats. They are geographically contained. They have a limited capability to strike out via terror attacks, but beyond that they pose little to no threat to the world.  The countries around them that are considered our allies have more than 4 million troops available.  ISIS could be wiped out in a matter of weeks or months if there was political will among those countries. That there isn't political will is not due to religion, as Rick pointed out earlier. It is about money and the politics of power. It is about oil sold to Turkey, or arms sold by the USA and Russia to continue these wars.  It is about reconstruction contracts.  It is about so much more.  Because surely if the USA and Russia and Turkey and Egypt (just to name a few) really wanted ISIS gone, they would be gone already.  Now for the religion part of it.  ISIS are extreme, there is no question. I am horrified by all that they do, and all that they stand for.  Make no mistake about that.  But they are a small minority. The vast majority of Muslims want nothing to do with head chopping, and want the same thing every human wants (a la Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs).  They want equality, opportunity, love, peace and prosperity like anyone else.  When we bomb civilian cities in Syria, we are saying by our actions that those lives don't matter. ISIS is telling them the West hates you, they bomb you, they want to kill you. And then we do it and prove them right.  We literally ARE the infidel from their point of view, because we are trying to kill them in their land.  We give ISIS credence by our actions. No one who pulled their dead child out of the rubble of their apartment is ever going to be on our side again. And I don't blame them for it.  Then on the other side, ISIS kills civilians in a terror attack, and we clamor for more bombing.  All we are doing is creating cycles of hatred and revenge. This is how Israel and Palestine treat each other, and they are no closer to a solution.  I am not saying do nothing. I am saying that bombing is doing the wrong thing."
959263,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-24 04:31:00,8243,"Killing innocents is only collateral damage after all.

959274,Canuck,2016-02-24 11:41:00,491,"That is a great analogy and I agree completely.  And I suspect that some on this board would say those Quebecers were right to terrorize because of what English Canada did to them in the 1800s.  Bottom line is that the the simple problems in the world were all solved long ago.  The more complicated the issue, the less likely it can be solved.  We cannot undo the past, only prevent further damage.  As always, you are all an interesting bunch.  Great insight from other perspectives, left right middle, libertarian leaning.  I respect them all, even when I don't agree. We are all better for knowing the the other perspectives.  And the freedom to openly debate and disagree IS worth fighting for.   The few middle eastern countries that share that philosophy are the ones under attack by radicalism, and despite the oil and other political aspects, that is a major reason for us to do something."

That's a good way to think about it.  I think what a lot of people who demand more fighting over there forget is that the vast majority of the fighting has been going on over there. There hasn't been a major conflict in North America for 150 years. Hell, there are still many living Europeans that are old enough remember having their homes and hometowns obliterated for someone else's war. Who the ""terrorist"" is all a matter of perception.  The sad fact is if there wasn't this black stuff bubbling up under the sand over there, no one here would care. There have been just as many atrocities occurring in Africa but no one cares because the western countries have pretty much cut ties with Africa since we figured out how to synthesize rubber. Hell, there are many that say WWIII has already taken place in Africa. http://www.ibtimes.com/congo-world-war-nobody-knows-about-213207  I have no idea where I'm going with this tangent but I think the point is all you do by bombing cities when you're not actually fighting a government or an actual organized military (or even when you are) is spreading hatred amongst the inhabitants of that city. When you're fighting ISIS you're not fighting people, you're fighting an idea. I'm not sure we've developed a bomb yet that can destroy ideas."

Makes you think what has been gained by losing trillions of $$ and so many lives of our soldiers.  The real question is would we be better off today or worse off today if we did nothing in the past?  If anyone thinks they actually know that answer, they are wrong.  If the US and Canada decided to do nothing and avoid bombing and potentially killing innocent people when Hitler's ideological army started to march, would we be better off or worse off?   What if Canada or the US decided we could help best by providing logistics and training to the British and French forces, but stay out of it other than that.  WW2 cost the world a lot of money?  Did we gain anything from it?  A key difference from how Hitler wanted to spread his ideology was that he did not slowly build a worldwide following of his ideology.  Technology did not allow it as easily then, and his egomania got in the way too.    These global terrorist groups are, in some ways much more advanced.  Stopping the new ISIL/Al Qaeda/Taliban Nazis from marching their ideology is not going to be as ""easy"" as WW2.  Its a different world and a smarter enemy."
959312,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 15:39:00,11391,"No doubt, and all this is just crazy.  The west along with other countries fund militant coupes,train them and ""aid"" with arms, then just leave them as they are and they cause conflicts and overthrow governments etc and eventually they become armies with their own agendas and ideologies. See my post about hillary clinton talking about al queda.  On top of that the arms supplies make alot of people very rich.  The west utilizes this tactic often to destabalize and overthrow countries the take resources and provide huge unpayable loans theough the IMF, and when they cant pay, badda bing badda BOOM, you know own the resources and have the political pressure to ensure whomever rises to power fits the agendas of the west.  Multinational corperations are so rich and powerfull they even have governments doing there bidding for them.  Many of these people are the vile of the earth. Goerge soros, the rockefellers, bilderburgers, fords etc.  And while radical islam does what its doing, muslims all get the blame.  And whos this protect? Look at all these scumbags  They are almost all jewish. Ashkenazi jews and they are waaay worse than radical islam. Look at their ideals  Throughout history they have been removed from many countries forceably because anywhere they go they have tried to conquer lands(mostly through monetary means)"

I just don't see these two situations as comparable. I mostly agree, but the Nazis came from something too. They didn't just spring up out of the ground overnight. And if you want to be real technical about it, it can easily be argued the Nazi party was born out of oppression and a thirst for revenge against Germany after WWI. ISIS wants to become the Nazi party. They call themselves the Islamic STATE for a reason. It's not really that far fetched, IMO. But the key difference is the Nazis didn't start with behedings before they had significant support. And even then, without Googling statistics I'm pretty sure the Nazis never had more than a third of support among voters in Germany at their height. Still millions of people, but not a majority by any stretch."

959147,woodenboater,2016-02-23 22:08:00,2277,"I haven't read the entire piece but what I will say is that when Bush used the word 'Crusade' after 9-11, I thought that was a huge risk. That word is absolutely frought with history and context and it was either used specifically to invoke fear and to shore his Christian base or because it sounded tough. Imo, it was reckless to use that word and he/they should have seen that it might foment hysteria among the extremists. Why poke the bear ? and here we are today..."
959153,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-23 22:34:00,8243,"I thought Bush said Jihad, he may have said Crusade as well. The toughest job in the world had to be the White House Press Secretary when marble mouth douleya was Prez.  Man this thread is getting deep. I have to say is that Arabic is one of the most difficult languages in the world to directly translate a word in one single English word. I have a pal who's father was a chemical engineer and he lived in the middle east growing up and learned Farsi and Liturgical Arabic. Many Arabic's can't understand each other when they speak. There is a Sicilian dialect that has as much Arabic as Italian. No way some people in Italy can understand a word they are saying to each other and they are both speaking Italian. When I speak Calabrese to my Father he has no clue sometimes as to what I'm saying. Be careful trying to translate a language literally when you have no clue how to speak that language. Japanese is another language that can't be directly translated into English for many words. The same word with a different inflection means something completely different. Say good morning in Japanese to someone in the afternoon or night and it means you or something is late.  Going back to the Crusades? Man this is going to be good.  y the way Woodenboater that link is a good read and from a fairly good source with ties to Sydney University I believe. Sometimes these Internet News sources are a complete joke."

958692,Big Cliff,2016-02-21 09:17:00,6899,"Maybe to get this thread back on track I went back and re read the CTV report and watched the video and did a bit of Googling this story. When I think of a homeless shelter of which I have never been in one. I picture and old dank warehouse that has 50 single beds in the middle of a cold draughty room with that many alcoholics and addicts in those beds. The shelter Ms. Flan was sent to is not that. It is almost new, clean, has marble pillars in the foyer. Would I want to live there, of course not, should Fran Flam have to recover there after surgery, of course not. But it isn't the place I pictured in my mind. I have no idea why there are not rehab places such as the one Mom stayed in for 3 months after breaking her arm, St. Peters in Hamilton. There is a charge to the patient if unless their income will not cover the $1800.00 a month fee. Ms. Flan would not pay in her case. This is on the B.C. health system and the landlord. Her apartment was being sprayed for bed bugs, how long does that take? A day, a week, months? If I am a renter and work has to be done on my rental I can't see how the landlord can say ""you are out on the street"". I was a landlord but not for long, not for me unless I had a partner to share the workload.For any renters here maybe you can tell us how this works. I have rented before and the place had to be sprayed for earwigs, I didn't have to move out.  It is sad that some of the most vulnerable in our society are our most precious, children and the elderly. But I have never heard of one person ever saying ""please raise my taxes so we can better take care of those most in need"".  This isn't on Justin Big Cliff. He may increase funding to the provinces in the future, but where will this increase in funding come from? Maybe grounding 6 fighter Jets? Sending a few hundred troupes over seas shouldn't increase the military budget, soldiers are paid whether here or there anyway. Thanks, I should look into it, the maximum is still only $1092.00 a month, not much of a pension after paying into it for 50+ years and yes, I still pay into it even now.  I am not blaiming Justin for anything (yet), but he is the golden boy who is going to ""fix things"". I think gettin our own house in order first should be his priority. There are plenty of things that could be improved on and lots of questions that I'd like to see answered like:  Why do we need food banks in Canada?  Why three winters ago when propane went through the roof did we have seniors having to decide between staying warm and eating? Does Justin or Wynne have to wait for 4-6 hours in an emergency room to see a DR if they have something in their eye?  Do they have to lay on a stretcher in a hallway because there are no rooms available in the hospital?  If their 84 year old mother was in the hospital because she had a stroke would the hospital be able to send her home in a cab to an empty apartment because they needed the bed? (that's what they tried to do to my mother).  Like I said, I'm not blaiming Justin but there is plenty of things that need to be taken care of here before we go off trying to save the world."

958698,Canuck2fan,2016-02-21 12:58:00,1444,"For all the ruckus this post has caused, one thing is clear. PEOPLE on here CARE!!!! There is a very healthy difference of what we propose as solutions, which is great IMHO. The trouble we have as Canadians is getting from the caring part to the acting part in numbers large enough to effect change!!!  When something like this sickening situation comes out in the media it makes people's blood boil who care, but blaming anyone or anything for her plight is pointless, if we don't ACT to change it once and for all.  Only because the money controlling folks WANT us to be divided rather than to wise up and see we have MORE than enough resources, to look after vets, seniors, the mentally ill, the disabled and any other group who can't or won't for WHATEVER reason provide for themselves in this country. Sadly though the psychopaths who run the money/power system in this country won't allow it because it will mean just a little less for them....  It is as if the money changers know they can rely on the fact that little tiny divides between who we think deserves financial dignity, means they can deny it to all, while feathering their nests a little deeper.  There is a poster going around the internet....  A banker, a worker and an immigrant are sitting in a Timmies. There is a plate with 20 cookies on it. The banker being a banker with an MBA grabs 19 cookies and pockets them. Then wags her finger at the worker, you better watch it!!!! The immigrant here is going to steal your cookie if you don't stop them.  Sadly, as a nation though we keep taking the bait and never stand up and yell at the banker. YOU are the real problem we could have all had 6.333 cookies... (leaving you one for interest you whine) To add insult to injury the banker then STILL charges us .10 cookie to hold it for us, while we use the rest room, because we ARE afraid the immigrant will get it. LOL  Now all we really need to do is to decide does the banker keep getting 19 cookies while we beat each others brains out for the remaining cookie. Or, is it time the banker just gets 10 or maybe 6 so the rest of us can have some whole cookies too...."

958714,Dutch01,2016-02-21 15:12:00,1431,"1) Not once have I read anywhere that it is his ""top priority"". If you can find a source for that claim I'd like to see it.  2) This is a serious issue that had been dodged by PM after PM since the Le Dain Commission recommended legalization in 1972.  Consider:  -Canada has the highest rate of use among youth in the entire world. Clearly prohibition isn't working. Canada is also recognized as a leader around the world in reducing youth tobacco use. This would suggest that we already know how to curb youth pot use.  -It is a matter of freedom. I do not accept the government telling me I cannot use a benign plant for my own personal reasons (be they medical or recreational).  I would no more allow them to tell me I cannot eat tomatoes than to tell me I cannot have my herbs.  You clearly don't use marijuana, but I'd like know why you think you have the moral authority to tell me I can't.  -Canada arrested and prosecuted 25,542 people for marijuana possession last year (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/canadians-facing-pot-charges-in-limbo-while-liberals-work-on-legalization/article27935465/?service=mobile). That's a lot of money for courts and judges and lawyers. Is it well spent? I think not. Perhaps they could have spent some of that money on the 82 year old that was the genesis for the start of this thread.  I am glad to see a PM actually attempting to address the issue with knowledge rather than ideology (are you listening Stephen Harper?)."

958722,Dutch01,2016-02-21 16:08:00,1431,"As stated, it is an opinion. You are correct there. But it is a fact that a government funded commission recommended legalization in 1972. It is a fact that no PM since then has moved to legalize. And finally, I would argue it is a fact that Trudeau's predecessor ""doubled down"" on prohibition. He passed legislation that increased some penalties, and arrests peaked nationally under his watch (27,997 arrests in 2011)."
958732,fish_fishburn,2016-02-21 17:13:00,1311,Mainstream media is a big problem. With all their fear mongering. They tell us only what they want us to hear to fit their own agenda. If you really want to know what is going on in our world you have to do your own research. Our dumbed down society believes all this garbage we see on the news every day because the majority is to lazy to educate themselves.  Mainstream media has never told us about terrorism in the 50's 60's and up to the late 70's was more prevalent then it is now. Don't believe me look it up yourself. Our biggest fear is not terrorism it's fear itself. Without fear we would never allow our gov't to militarize our police forces all for the sake of our safety. Erosion of our civil rights and privacy all for the sake of our safety.  As far as the stuff that went down on parliament hill on Oct 23 2014 maybe that was all done to ratchet up the fear factor so Harper could get his C51 bill passed. Call me a nut if you want but that's my 2 cents

ISIS doesn't care for freedom. -our federal budget comes out next month, with a projected DEFICIT of $90 Billion and likely growing. How can we afford to leverage our own children's future by continually spending, while our economy falters, badly? I think that's what the OP in this thread was getting at and with that in mind, I have to agree with Big Cliff. HH It's nice that we can help Syrian (and other) refugees but we really need to watch we don't kill the golden goose.  Where will the world be if Canada hits hard times and can't help others?  I think it's time to circle the wagons financially and wait for better times before we commit to helping others."

958482,Big Cliff,2016-02-19 20:10:00,6899,"Well, to clarify a few things:  First of all, I do have a chip on my shoulder but if you took the time to get to know me instead of trying to find fault with me you would know that it isn't about people that want to be Canadians, it's with people that want to turn Canada into something that it isn't.  Second: Government has taken away far more than it has given us. case in point; I have been paying into CPP since it's inception in 1965. Today my pension is worth less than $600.00 a month. Wow, I have been paying for over 50 years (both as an employee and as an employer) and my return is less than $600.00 a month?  Pay into a GM or OPG pension plan for 50 years and see what you get! (you want to know what happened to your money? No, you probably don't)  My OP wasn't about Canadians, refugees, men, women...... it was about a person in Canada that takes two busses and a sea bus to a part time job at 82 years old just to make ends meet and has to go to a homless shelter to recover from surgery. I think that is just about the meanest thing you can do to a senior Canadian or not!!!!!!  Justin Trudeau seems to think that running around commiting billions to other countries is the right thing to do! I say; lets fix Canada first then when we can afford to lets help others! Anyone that knows me knows that I have given away things that I could easily have sold because I believed I was helping others. The big thing here to consider is that I have given away what I and my family can afford to give away!  If you think Justin isn't a member of OFC, think again, I earlier did a post on OFC, an open letter to Justin and ended up getting a nice email from the office of the Prime Minister. Believe me, big brother is watching!  You want to be a Canadian? Welcome! You want to force me to be something other than a Canadian? Well you and I are going to have to agree to disagree!  Ya, I have a chip on my sholder but at 70 I still have to work because my family can't live on the $1300.00 a month that our government thinks I should be able to live on. Sorry if I ruffled some feathers but that's your problem!"

I respect you Cliff, but I have no idea where you think these foreigners are trying to change Canada. Where as the United States is a melting pot of cultures Canada has always been a mosaic. Have you ever been to Quebec? These people are not foreigners, they are fellow Canucks, talk about cultural differences. This is an argument that can not be won.

In 1939 he was arrested for being an enemy of the Crown and spent WW2 in the Prisoner of War camp at Camp Pettawawa.   This here is a really disgraceful act by our country. Same as the Japanese. Same as the Chinese after the steel road was built. We weren't perfect then but we've improved a helluva lot since then. We still have some ways to go but I'd sooner be here than anywhere else on this giant marble.  Learning from our past shouldn't be that difficult...

958363,woodenboater,2016-02-19 00:03:00,2277,"6 jets is just a dog and pony show and won't make much difference if any when they're grounded. We'll be sending in troops to train the Kurds I believe and they have serious beef and won't back down and are probably one of the best hopes of fighting ISIS. So while other countries do the air war, Canada will be on the ground iirc.  From all I've read from people on the ground and with knowledge of the fight, pounding them with heavy metal is doing jack squat. They're like mice and rats, they just scatter and regroup. This is not traditional warfare and military leaders and governments need to think creatively and differently, but sadly they're stuck in the sand and spinning their wheels. The MC is, imo, having influence in this fight as they're the only ones with anything to gain.  Sadly this will be Afghanistan and Iraq v2.0 etc"
958367,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-19 00:13:00,8243,"Grounding a half dozen fighter planes and ending the dropping of 500 lb. bombs on them I agree with. The co lateral damage caused by dropping ordinance on them is counter productive. Winning the hearts and minds isn't accomplish with that, it just creates more terrorists. You killed my Mother, Father and baby brothers and sisters and you don't think I'm coming after you? Come on man, I'm first in line.  We aren't pulling out. We are actually upping the ante by sending in more than 150 Special Forces, I can't remember the exact number of boots that will on the ground. They will be training the Kurds and Iraqis which is military speak for picking out some Isis goofs and blowing the head off them with a 50 cal. Then turn to the trainee and say, that's how it's done, now you try. A 500 pound bomb isn't as accurate. I agree fight them there or at places like Nathan Philips Square or the Rogers's Centre. I pick there.  Rick if Isis killed your family you would be on the next plane to Syria, that I know for certain. And you aren't a draft dodger, there isn't mandatory conscription in the USA since the 70's. So it's safe to visit your old home. If they throw you in the Brig I'll break you out."

He hasn't been PM long enough to find all the bathrooms in Sussex Place. Let's maybe give him a bit of a chance, he's all we have for 5 years unless he's given a non confidence boot.  Many of our homeless here have nothing to do with the lack of helping them. For many reasons some refuse help, many because of mental illness. Some Canadians out on the street are there because of addiction. Some because they have had a bad break and are desperately trying to back on track. Some Canadians because they are lazy and won't work. They would rather rob from you and I to get their next fix or beg on the corner to buy their next bottle of Aqua Velva or spray paint to get high.  Helping others in dire need, like these refugees fleeing a war of genocide, is what Canada is and has always been all about, and I'm proud of it personally. If Canada didn't let my Grand Father immigrate here before WW1 I wouldn't be here. He went on to fight for the King in WW1 and came back with a plate in his head. In 1939 he was arrested for being an enemy of the Crown and spent WW2 in the Prisoner of War camp at Camp Pettawawa. Canada isn't perfect, wasn't then and isn't now but no matter what it is the only country to be a citizen of. For reasons like saving refugees.  I'm behind our PM on this one, 110%. Don't forget 49% didn't vote for him so 1/2 the voters will never agree with him."
