959633,Tjames09,2016-02-25 17:24:00,664,"Hey everyone,  new member here thought i'd get the ball rolling. I mainly shore fish the Sturgeon river (where my in-laws have a place on the waterfront). We sometimes go out in the boat, but the boat they have isnt meant for fishing and the times we have gone out the water is usually pretty rough, and the boat they have is definitely not meant for rough water, it can get pretty scary out there in this tiny boat from the 70s.  Anyways Im always looking for new good shore spots aside from their dock. I have gone to the old railroad bridge north of Ken Reid park to fish but havent really had any luck in that section. Ive also driven up to Long Beach to fish off the dock, but it felt like we werent supposed to be there, and we caught nothing.  ive looked into getting my own boat, but the Mrs isnt a fan of that investment"
