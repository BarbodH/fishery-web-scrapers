959946,bigcreekdad,2016-02-27 02:29:00,546,"I've had a pretty reliable Alumacraft 165 Magnum tiller for 16 years. It's been a damn good boat. I'm on my second Yamaha...60hp. I fish with it at least 4 weeks a year in Ontario, as well as outings to several lakes near our cabin in northern Michigan.  I've been toying with a new boat. Still a tiller, but maybe moving up a foot in length...reason being, I'm fishing a bit more with my two sons and casting with 3 would be easier. And, newer boats seem to have way better rod storage. Finally, starting to have some rot in the floors.  None of the above are big issues. That being said, I'm closer to 70 than 65, and likely may not outlive (at least as an independent boater) a new boat. However, a new boat would be ""fun"" and, as I wind down from semi retirement, I'll likely use it more in the short run (0-10 years).  So...if you were in my shoes, would you make the leap, and, if so, what brand/model would you consider? I'm partial to Alumacraft, and, obviously, would include Lund in the search, but give me your thoughts.  This is a great,diverse group...I'm hoping for lots of ""chat"".  "
959947,landry,2016-02-27 02:33:00,1005,I love the Tuffy 1760 tillers. That is my retirement boat - I hope. Fiberglass.
959948,scugpg,2016-02-27 02:34:00,1373,I've been mulling a what if scenario if I went to a bigger tiller. Alumacraft or the G3 17f tiller with a 60-70hp would likely be my choice. Lund pro guide or Crestliner pro tillers is a bit too big and quite expensive for my needs.  Classic or competitor for alumacraft Angler v170t for G3
959960,Bondar,2016-02-27 07:37:00,817,"The new alumacraft tillers are amazing boats, the 18' has so much room and storage. They ride nice. The 20' er is unreal haha I'd love one of those. I love how you can walk around the whole perimeter of the boat like the whole thing is a casting deck and how the deck extends over the splash well. Super nice boats.. and I have a lund lol my Dad has the 18' alumacraft with a 90 etec. Handles big water no problem"
959965,scugpg,2016-02-27 11:23:00,1373, Thanks
960001,Bondar,2016-02-27 16:18:00,817,You can check them out at Marshs marine I believe  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CBKkt-BQR24
960004,Rizzo,2016-02-27 16:28:00,4754,Think there is one out by Orillia...I bought the last one Clarence had at Bay City!
960008,Grimace,2016-02-27 16:51:00,2020,I have always liked those Lund Alaskans.
960016,mike rousseau,2016-02-27 17:59:00,4661,"I've run my cousins 18 Lund pro guide 90 merc 4 stroke a bunch of times  AWESOME boat... Especially with the power steering on the tiller... My old 9.9 was harder to handle then this 90  I was also recently looking at the Roplene boats from triumph... But these boats don't have any frills... Very basic...  If I could get a new tiller boat tomorrow and money wasn't a factor for the purchase I'd likely get a  Lund pro guide 1775 (17' 9"") with a 90 hp 4 stroke (max hp) with power steering  This also has 9' rod storage wich is a big deal for is musky guys"
960052,Steve,2016-02-27 21:01:00,2075,"I would agree with you. If money wasn't an object, I would also choose the Pro Guide 1775 with the 90hp Yammy.  It isn't much different than my Pro Guide 1700 (17'4""), but it is much wider!"
960122,Sinker,2016-02-28 01:04:00,8692,"Id get an 18 alaskan or a starcraft freedom. I need dual purpose to fish and duck hunt though, so the pro guide and the likes i would destroy in the marsh.  S."
960127,pike slayer,2016-02-28 01:37:00,1177,If money is no concern then I'd buy a whole new setup. You only live once and you aren't getting any younger so get something you'll be comfortable in. It will probably out last you and itll get past on and they can enjoy the good memories in that boat!
960143,porkpie,2016-02-28 04:19:00,2521,"If you've been happy with your alumacraft, then stick with the brand.  I've never been in one, but I've never heard anyone say a bad thing about them!  They have some pretty good looking boats from what I've seen.  I do love lund Alaskans though, that would be the other boat I'd look at."
960163,grt1,2016-02-28 16:43:00,638,the double hull on the alumacraft  was a big selling point for me when I bought my boat in 2001 I got the 185 trophy alumacraft  with a 150 and it is a very stable boat in big water.  I don't know if lund has the double hull.
960291,2 tone z71,2016-02-29 12:06:00,1311,"Lunds  had the double hull since 89-90 I believe,you can't go wrong with either ,I'm a Lund owner but a big fan of alumacraft,if you decide to sell your ole girl ,give me first dibs I'd love to restore it"
960292,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-29 12:17:00,8243,"Which ever boat you choose just do it. As they say ""we ain't getting any younger"". I can't say I have any experience with an Alumicraft but have only heard good things about them. Almost as good as StarCraft."
960294,fishindevil,2016-02-29 12:32:00,6254,"I am a long time lund owner as well with a 50hp tiller,and it does everything I need or want to do....go with a minimum of 16.5ft and then you have a decent big water boat....like the guys said above a 1775 tiller is awesome !!!!!"
