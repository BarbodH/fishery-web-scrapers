Personally, I've never been there, but am thinking about checking it out on Saturday.  Anyone here ever been?   http://www.outdooradventureshow.ca/toronto/index.html"

960356,arob,2016-02-29 20:04:00,2,"Images from the 2016 Toronto Outdoor Adventure Show,  This is the canoe / display inside the main entrance to the show, It was just past the ticket booth - i paid $14 so I dont know why everyone says $10, unless they are seniors? r maybe the show used to be $10 and now it costs fourteen.. That's probably it  The Grey Owl Adventures contest ? who won?; you know so many of the contests and 'challenges' at the show are Bull. totally fraud . Did anyone hear who won this one ? I entered.   Here are the guys from Xcitelife fun things to do website - sharing economy meets weekend plans..   Peter from Outpost Magazine was helpful - good energy and a cool guy.   Here's Scott MacGregor from Rapid Media (the guy with hair) - he gave me a link to the free Kayak Buyers Guide online   \There were a couple different spin the wheel games - there were kids everywhere   Kids rock climbing and zip lining between platforms overhead too  I asked the native Canadian Iroquois if he ever smiled and he said 'no' in this case it would not be an accurate representation of his people or the Voyage of the Iroquois attraction.,    and finally, my favourite booth was D&D Meats out of Alliston Ontario which makes delicious salami   those are my pictures... What did you guys you guy see ?"
