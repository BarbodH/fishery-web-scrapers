959828,Headhunter,2016-02-26 16:07:00,5703,"Carbon cap and trade is a MAJOR tax grab.  Sure, (for those of you that think that companies are ""the bad guys"") the nasty carbon emitters will be the ones paying, but where do you think that money will come from?  The oil companies and other companies will have to pass the carbon taxes on to customers (that's all of us) or go out of business.  Liberal taxes in the form of carbon credits will be $1.9 BILLION next year and that INCREASES as the limits get reduced.    And what are they going to spend it on?  More ""green"" initiatives that are pushing Ontario electricity rates up vastly higher than they need to be.  And the profits from those green initiatives are going to the foreign companies that own those wind and solar farms.  So they are going to increase our taxes to help pay for increasing our cost of electricity yet again.  Gas prices will increase (estimate of 4.3 cents/litre next year alone).  Some other industries will simply vanish.  We won't be making steel in Ontario anymore (maybe that has happened already). You can argue that is good or bad, but the jobs will go with them.  What is the ""cost"" of lost jobs.  OMG, I cannot wait to see what they have in store for us next.  I guess next year Kathleen will be encouraging us all to ""Chill man. Go down to the LCBO and score a blunt and it will all be irie.""  So the naive will get their soft warm buzz and vote Liberal again next time.   Quote on the cap and trade;  Sousa defended increased costs from cap and trade. ""We can all of us have a choice,"" he said. ""We can turn our back and let the low-carbon economy go by, it will cost us even more, or we can embrace it and find innovations in the system to enable us to succeed and compete."" The carbon-pricing scheme is now projected to generate $1.9 billion in revenue next year, up from $1.3 billion estimated a few months ago, based on a price of about $18 per tonne. The cap is expected to decline 4.17 per cent each year to 2020, putting increasing pressure on industry to meet emissions targets, and, critics say, increasing costs to consumers. Revenue from cap and trade will be dedicated to green initiatives, the government says, but the Opposition believes it will be used to fund the Liberals' political whims. Couldn't have said it better myself! Funny, months ago when it was released that we are going to get cap and trade, I was told by my MPP's office that the consumer will not see an increase as a result of the program, then we find out this! I still can't figure out how my paying more for fuel, is going to save the planet. HH"

As much as everyone dislikes Southern Ontario, that's where all your tax revenue comes from.  Actually south of North Bay the province is really divided, The map looks quite blue , you have to go to the urban inserts of the postage stamp size ridings in the GTA and other urban centres to find Lieberal red, there is a very real urban vs rural division in politics in Canada today.

If anyone has ever driven on thruways in places like NY that will knock the headlights out of your vehicle you wouldn't complain as much. And they have to pay a toll too!
