959841,icefisherman,2016-02-26 17:19:00,952,"Gave another try to the whities today. Glad I did as it was best day so far this season.  From 7:30 till 10am final score was 12/15....Meegs knocked them down again. Maybe at the very end of the not so great ice season we'll get few hot bite days.  Several shots for your viewing pleasure. Was so cold. The two that made it on the ice froze within 2 min. Had to release them inside the hole very quickly to help them get back to the deep.                   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
