957760,Fisherpete,2016-02-14 15:26:00,1814,"Hello everyone, the event may be cancelled due to poor ice conditions, but I would still like to carry on the OFC tradition and raise a few dollars for Tyler and send it to his mom. As in previous years I am offering up two guided trips, one for spring (typically mid-late April) catfishing on the Grand River in Dunnville for big catfish, and a Kawartha muskie hunt (June-Dec). Full details listed below. Bidding for either trip starts at $100, and bids must increase in $10 increments. Bidding starts today, and will end at 9pm on February 21st. If transportation is an issue, I'm sure we can figure something out.  Trip 1 - Spring Cats on the Grand River in Dunnville (April-May). Best guided day last year with OFC members was 39 cats, biggest two that day were over 20 pounds. Can accommodate up to three guests for this trip. All gear, cutbait and beverages (water and Powerade or pop) provided. Full day fishing (start as early and stay as late as you want to fish that day)   Trip 2 - Kawarthas Muskie Hunt (June-Nov or Dec depending on ice conditions) Casting trip will be for for one guest - trolling we can do two guests. I specialize on Balsam, Scugog, Sturgeon or Pigeon but am always open to exploring new Kawartha lakes. I have all right handed retrieve reels, so if you are a lefty you will need to bring your own reels please. Best guided days last year with OFC members were 6 and 5 muskies, longest three fish were 45.75"", 45.75"" and 45"". All gear (except lefty reels), tackle and beverages (water and Powerade or pop) provided. Full day fishing (start as early and stay as late as you want to fish that day).  Here's a few pics of some of last years catches.                              "

Everyone I have brought just loved it, Pete knows his stuff 100% and reeling in a nice big 10+ pound channel cat is a great workout on the arms.  Money goes to a good cause as well. Don't pass this one up!"

Please specify in your bid what species you are interested in. Sorry about the confusion.  I should also mention that my guided trips come with a fish guarantee - if we don't catch the target species of the day, we go out again on me."
