Didnt take long to get them top side. Off the ice by 9am. Got to love having the lake at your front door.  Those are 2+ lb herring. MONSTERS, They hammered that spoon, and gave a nice thumping fight. All came on the half & half again.      "
960166,Meegs,2016-02-28 17:11:00,249,Nice buddy... was going to stop by but went to different spot ended up putting a beating on them myself

960168,davey buoy,2016-02-28 17:14:00,5505,"Great job,thinking may have to secretly follow you next Sat lol !!!!!"
960170,misfish,2016-02-28 17:20:00,29133,"Ice is 9""-10"".  James I figured that since I got no text. I had two smash the meegs, but I cant for the life of me, get them top side. Thats why I went back to the lazy flip/flop spoon. I cant put that thing down ever since Andy showed me the correct way to fish it. Those herring were zinging mid depth chasing shinners just at first light.  Davey,if you can find me, you can join me. Newfie gps is only $9.99 plus coffee."
