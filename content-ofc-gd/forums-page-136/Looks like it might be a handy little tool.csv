959564,Dara,2016-02-25 14:11:00,3052,Neat
959588,Fish Farmer,2016-02-25 15:39:00,2234,"Have a dozen of them, not worth thinking about Cliff. You can tie a Palomar knot quicker. Buddy picked up a bunch at Icast and give me them, showed them to my other buds, they had a laugh. Sometimes Old School is better Clif"
959619,mike rousseau,2016-02-25 16:55:00,4661,What I do like is putting your hook inside it when traveling.... Nice and safe... Especially with kids around
959750,Dara,2016-02-26 03:02:00,3052,Kids shouldn't be around fish hooks anyway...theyr'e dangerous.  
959782,cheaptackle,2016-02-26 11:56:00,849,At first I thought it kinda cool too... Then I thought - treble hooks?  Doesn't look like it would work with them - which we use a lot!  Michael
959792,muddler,2016-02-26 12:23:00,623,I wonder. How well would that work with smaller steelhead hooks?

959819,Joey,2016-02-26 14:48:00,9122,"We have a few.  I don't use them for tying knots, I use them for travel.  I like them!"
959820,cheaptackle,2016-02-26 14:50:00,849,Joey - what about on treble hooks like I said?  They still work?  I'm guessing at best they'd only cover 1 of the 3.  Michael
959824,wormdunker,2016-02-26 15:39:00,1711,Neat gadget!  I'd at least give it a try.  Old school is good Fish Farmer but how old do you have to be!!  LOL!
959905,livinisfishin,2016-02-26 23:22:00,661,  That reply couldn't have been better!

959917,manitoubass2,2016-02-27 00:46:00,11391,Looks handy!  I just use a snap lock swivel however till im out on the water.
959923,wallyboss,2016-02-27 00:58:00,1095,I tried one and it was all right until I dropped it the drink. Will I get another one?  Probably not it is a gadget!!!!
