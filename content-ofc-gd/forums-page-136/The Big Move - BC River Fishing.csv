959582,AKRISONER,2016-02-25 15:31:00,5558,"Well guys,  It is with much excitement, but also much sorrow that the fiance and I have made the decision to make the big move to the Burnaby Coquitlam area of British Columbia.  It has been a dream of Becky and I to live in the mountains some day for many years and a job opportunity has presented itself, Becky and I are recently engaged, have no kids, and are making good money for our age. The window to do crazy stuff without disrupting a family etc is quickly closing so we are taking the dive.  I dont believe the move will be permanent because at the end of the day when it comes time to start up a family of my own, I believe that having our brothers, sisters and parents around will be critical to our hypothetical kids and those positives will far exceed any love that I will have for living in the mountains.  In no particular order the things I will miss the most are;  My few close friends that I have here My family and 100% most of all my cottage and boat in Pointe Au Baril   The things I wont miss;  Congestion in Toronto and the complete lack of a proper transit system the people of the GTA (this excludes the majority of people here, but i think you know what im talking about) The utter desolate corn field that is Southern Ontario The heat The Toronto Weather (yesterday was a perfect example...it doesnt get much worse than snow...and then 1 degree and pouring rain all day at least when it rains in Vancouver its 10 degrees with no wind)  The things I am most looking forward to: My home snowboarding hill being Whistler and Mount Baker (i like snowboarding probably as much as fishing, so thats saying something) The ability to drive 15 minutes and be in the mountains without a city or sound in sight Hiking Learning to River fish in my local neighborhood (not pier fish like the majority of SO opportunities lol A proper transit system  That being said, this past fall I took it upon myself to learn to river fish, im getting a little better with time, however fishing 6 times doesn't make a pro.  Everyone out west just seems to fly fish, but a lot of reading I am doing is also saying that plenty of guys cast spoons for the wild salmon runs and even for steel.  I know that in Ontario, plenty of people love to centrepin a float or simply cast using the long noodle rods. Does anyone around here have any experience fishing the river systems in BC? I am completely in the dark aside from what info i can read on the internet. I have been sleuthing, but the hardest part thus far has been finding any information about what the hell kind of gear people are using out there. Any info you guys can provide is greatly appreciated.  If anyone is willing to point me in a direction in regards to what rivers in the lower main land to try out that be extra awesome. I am even willing to trade spots!"
959587,jedimaster,2016-02-25 15:38:00,3472,"I moved to BC two years ago and just moved back. Its a huge difference in fishing out there compared to hear. To be honest I didn't really get into fishing too much. I mean I did go river fishing but unless you really get into it your going to the common sand bars for a couple weekends per year, getting a big boat for the ocean or sturgeon fishing. Yes there is bass fishing but its very underground and not very popular. There is some awesome fishing out there its just not my cup of tea. The seasons open and close daily for some species and you have to be ready to go at a moments notice as they send out text messages to update people on when the season opens and when it closes. Its very weird. The trick is to find the sand bars and hit it hard the second it opens if you are into salmon. The come in on mass and are gone just as quick. Very few resident fish in the fraiser outside of sturgeon.  I should note that the hunting is FREAKING AMAZING!!!! The regulations for both are very complex but oddly much more leanent than in ontario... eg no hunter orange"
959592,Sinker,2016-02-25 15:46:00,8692,"I found BC just as busy as ON, so don't look forward to that. The traffic sucks and the bridges are crazy. Otherwise it is beautiful country. My brother moved out there about ten years ago, then moved back here for two years, and last summer I drove him and all his belongings back to Vancouver to stay again. He loves it there. Its not really my style, but I can see how he would like it. Good luck out there.  S."
959608,solopaddler,2016-02-25 16:24:00,8605,"Fantastic! Most people never have the stones to follow their dream, good luck with the move and a big thumbs up!"
959609,landry,2016-02-25 16:28:00,1005,"Sinker is right. Traffic is a nightmare. It's expensive too. But it's still one of Canada's best spots to live IF u can Afford it. I lived there for 4 years. Loved it. I have also steelheaded some there. PM me and I will Give u a great tip/spot. Float reels, with heavier float rods, line and bigger foats are the way to go. Take a guided trip when u get there to familiarize yourself. That's what I did. And btw, the current and fish are typically waaaay stronger. Be careful as you learn."
959615,bare foot wader,2016-02-25 16:42:00,1354,"You won't miss this, because you'll be living it daily in the lower wasteland  Congestion in Toronto and the complete lack of a proper transit system the people of the GTA"
959623,AKRISONER,2016-02-25 17:05:00,5558,"You won't miss this, because you'll be living it daily in the lower wasteland  Congestion in Toronto and the complete lack of a proper transit system the people of the GTA  the sky train is a total breeze compared to the joke that is the streetcar/subway It currently takes me 45-55 minutes to travel 5 kilometers to work every day...brutal...hence i started riding a bike to work to avoid the gongshow.  those that are in the know are getting a PM big time!  and thanks Mike, I know you have some experience in the whole follow your dream deal! good on ya!"
959624,bare foot wader,2016-02-25 17:11:00,1354,"I moved to BC for the Olympics, and knew it would be a lifetime move before I left, upon arrival I knew I made the right decision for me  Certainly fly fishing/spey fishing is very popular out here, but basically every form of fishing is popular....you'll see guys swinging flies, chucking hardware and floating roe all in the same day....the rivers are much stronger, wade with extreme caution, wear an inflatable and most times you'll never be over knee deep water....relatively same principles as ON, just upsized gear, heavier rods, line and reels...no noodle rods, no 3lb leaders for steelhead, think 20lb mainlines, 15lb leaders, 30gr floats...if you're not comfortable with a centrepin, you'll do just fine with a baitcaster  The BC fishing mapbook is worth buying, will help with the common spots for bar fishing and access points on a lot of rivers...but the vedder, stave, capilano, squamish/cheakamus/mamquam are all popular with easy access and provide good fishing when the timing is right, and always resident trout/cutties/whitefish around  Definitely need to give sturgeon a try while you're here, it's an amazing fishery with some strong fish  Whis and Baker are awesome, but also lots of smaller ski towns with wicked terrain and 99% less crowds and commercialism  If you're interested in hunting, I could go on about that too  I live north in PG, but still make the rounds around all the rivers in the lower mainland, feel free to PM anytime"
959657,AKRISONER,2016-02-25 18:47:00,5558,"bare, you will be getting a lengthy PM shortly lol"
959672,suds,2016-02-25 20:41:00,70,"Exciting times! I grew up out on the Island and am counting the days until I can move back. The trouble is my wife loves her job and its 5 minutes from home, so patiently waiting lol.  Not much to add on the river fishing; the others have covered a lot of it. Almost all rivers that lead to the ocean have steelhead potential, so you don't have to stick to the ones in the lower mainland. You can be the only person on a river having a great day if you do a little hunting  Don't overlook Hemlock or Cypress..right after work for a few rides. Nighttime at Grouse can be spectacular when its clear and cold!  I would advise you to spend the 200 bucks on a float tube and fins. I assume you have waders lol. Every lake has rainbows, cutties, or bass potential. Some have all of them! A short drive to the Cariboo and you are into BIG trout. You don't need to fly fish if you don't want to, spinning gear will work. The other bonus on trout fishing is it never closes. Lots of little lakes that are short hikes away where you can be alone too.  Fishing licenses are a big difference; you need one for fresh, one for salt water. You need stamps for certain species. You need a certain  stamp to fish for salmon in rivers, you need a special steelhead stamp. I think you get the idea lol. Buying all of them ( which I always did- nothing worse that getting the call and being unprepared was 100 bucks ten years ago) now you can get them online at least.  But the thing I miss most is Dungeness crabbing, picking oysters and mussels, and digging for clams. All you need is a basic saltwater licence for that.  Oh ya, and traffic really sucks in the lower mainland and the price of the ferries will shock you.  Best of luck,  suds"

One big surprise you will get is that even though you move there, don't expect to get a resident license right away! Can take six months. So what that means is a non resident license, steelhead tag, restricted rivers license at a cost of $20/DAY! plus anything else they can hook you for. I have fished many rivers in the Terrace/Smithers area, for steelhead. I can't wait to go back again this fall. Oh, and the other thing is that B.C. is the abbreviation for Bring Cash!"
959681,jedimaster,2016-02-25 21:59:00,3472,Minimum of 6 months wait to get your resident card. As in 6 months from when you get your health card or switch your drivers licens over so do those asap. I missed a hunting draw date by two days from my 6 months. Also another thing to keep in mind is if you move out there I would do it as late in the year as possible and if moving back do it as early in the year as possible. The Taxes are less in BC so the later in the year you do it the bigger your tax refund will be. if you move back to ontario at the end of the year you will get screwed as I did. Keep all your reciepts for moving purposes for your tax. Also go to the Ontario ministry of transportation before you leave and get a certified drivers license history. NOT an abstract. Drivers license history. You need that to prove how long you have driven for so you don't have to go through graduated licensing. Also prepare a document from your insurance company. For each year of no claims you get a 5% discount on insurance. Everyone pays the exact same base rate for car insurance. and the only way to get lower is by years of driving with no claims. Make sure you letter states each year you have had continuous coverage with no claims. You can use your OHIP card for a few months but if you want to get your resident fishing card switch it over to BC services asap.   An about the 6 months thing. a Lease or house purchase or proof from employer is not proof of residency for fishing and hunting. The 6 month clock starts the day your application gets recieved and put into the system. I think its a 2 month wait to get your health card switched over from what I recall.  So basically get it done asap
959684,jedimaster,2016-02-25 22:11:00,3472,"When you move if you get confused drop me a line I went through the whole thing recently. Basically OHIP is called MSP and everyone pays for it. Its not free. So make sure your new employer will pay for MSP because its a bit costly. it will take time to get enrolled. Try and get them to waive the probationary period for the MSP coverage or that will extend your 6 months wait time to get a fishing license. Of course you can just get a non resident fishing license but you can only get a small game non resident hunting license if you hunt. Well you can get a non resident but you need a guide or something that has hunted big game for the last 2 years to sponsor you but you will still need to prove your 6 months residency. The health card and drivers license are combined into a BC Services card. You can get it and do both your MSP and your drivers license at the same office. Go to any ICBC location. Your car gets done privately through a broker but the prices are provincially regulated so there are no deals from one place to another. You also get your ownership and license plate at the insurance brokers. They are everywhere grocery stores malls etc...  You will need to get an out of province inspection to transfer your cars. They check everything, basicaly a safety permit but there is no Emissions testing in BC so thats a plus. You can get the inspection done at any canadian tire. If I think of other things I will add it here. But I think thats the gist of it."
959696,Bill Shearer,2016-02-25 23:25:00,456,"Jedimaster obviously has a handle on the whole thing! Well done! I just mentioned the 6 month wait because a friend went through it. He lives right on a fantastic Steelhead stream, and had to pay $20 every day to fish it! Besides the non resident fees, Steelhead tag etc. Oh the pain!"
959702,jedimaster,2016-02-25 23:54:00,3472,"Also fishing is more expensive but hunting is a lot cheaper and way more plentiful. On one mountain on the right week you can hunt moose, elk, mule deer, white tail, black bear, grizzley, cougar, mountain goat, grouse, ptarmagan, turkey and maybe even mountain sheep. The hunting restrictions are very confusing but as I mentioned it's so much more plentiful, diverse and lest restricted than in Ontario. Hunting dream out there. One weekend, I had grouse and eggs for breakfast, rabbit for lunch and deer heart for dinner."
959720,manitoubass2,2016-02-26 00:55:00,11391,Awesome!!!  I absolutely love BC!  Thats really cool to hear your chasing your dreams and I hope Im welcome to visit as my uncle runs a charter there! Well plus hip hop!  Enjoy!!!

I will still be around a little longer, this whole non residency thing is irking me hard! It basically seems like no matter what I wont be able to fish in BC for six months...ouch. Ill drop you a PM to get your digits so that i can give you a shout if I have any questions.  Im not a hunter so no worries there!"
959827,bigugli,2016-02-26 16:04:00,6138,Enjoy every minute of your adventure. Congrats on taking that leap to live your dreams.
959852,jedimaster,2016-02-26 18:11:00,3472,"Shoot me a line anytime. You don't need to be a resident to fish, you can fish anything as a non resident its just more expensive. I would highly recommend using a guide for each species once. Its not like fishing here. Very specific tactics and gear. If you fish the fraser (and you will) The sheer power of the water with even a bass could spool you and you won't be fishing for bass. Wait til you hook up with a fresh and horny ready to spawn 100 pound chinook. You will need every ounce of of a 12 foot shimano technium and 80 pound braid lashed to a Abu 7000 just to stand a chance. Musky have nothing on these fish in the river. I saw guys running down the bank for half a mile trying to keep the fish from spooling them only to come back with a reel still smoking from the heat with no line and shrugged shoulders.  My first sturgeon was a small one at 8 feet  and we chased it in the boat with a Penn 320 on max drag for 200 yards before I could turn its head.  Do your research, dig in and hold on.  You basically get yourself a non resident fishing license. As well as the conservation tags for each species you want to target. Salmon, Sturgeon, Steelhead, char, some types of rainbows all need species specific tags/licenses in addition to the annual license. You can basically get by with one big rod for salmon and one big rod for sturgeon. Sturgeon fishing is AWESOME!!! there is no feeling in the fishing world like having a 15 foot long 900 pound freshwater fish tear 300 yards of line out tailwaking 10 feet in the air.  The ministry basically sends out a mass text message to everyone that has salmon licence and tells them the second it opens and the second it closes. There is no set time. The reason is they monitor closely when the fish move out of the ocean up the rivers to spawn and allow a few waves to pass through to spawn before opening the season. They get an idea of the total number of staging fish weigh that against the number of licensed anglers and allow enough through that people can catch there limits and not kill the fishery. Sockeye basically have a massive run every 4 years and is something you don't want to miss. I think the next one is slated for next year.  Its easy to get frustrated and turned off to fishing if you don't know what to do, that's why I recommend hitting up a guide. You will have an awesome time. Just make sure you get all your paper works in order, get on top of the licenses and gather as much info. There are also lots of good forums out there for info."
959853,jedimaster,2016-02-26 18:25:00,3472,I would get an 11'6 technium or similar lamiglass for salmon and an 8 foot technium sturgeon rod for sturgeon. get two big reels. You will be lobbing 2-4 ounce lead weights into the river so you need that big backbone. The techniums are near indestructible and very highly regarded among the hard core guys out there. Fenwick HMX also has a decent following. an Abu 7000 or Penn 320 for reels. However I would recommend hitting up a guide first before buying anything. See what they use and ask to fish the way you will fish. EG shore or boat. They are good guys and will accommodate for cash. Did I mention get a guide? Its really worth it. Especially if you haven't fished in BC for river fish before.
959857,AKRISONER,2016-02-26 19:01:00,5558,"ahhh im so busy at work i dont have time at the moment to reply to this stuff, but the info you are tossing out is friggin gold.   Jedi whats your take on float reels? This is just the kind of info ive been looking for. Its hard to find exactly what models guys are using in order to be able to handle these fish.  I personally see myself mostly casting rivers for steel and salmon from shore and wading.  Definitely am going to save up some pennies and do a sturgeon guide, its pretty much a must.  Any reco's on a steel/salmon guide? the closer to burnaby i can fish the better!"
959893,jedimaster,2016-02-26 22:25:00,3472,I was was mostly on the Fraser itself between chilliwack and maple ridge. On the main river pretty much everyone tosses the big stuff with like a 10-20 ounce weight and a spin n glow. The float fishing is mostly on the Tribs with a 12 foot float rod and a center pin. I was mostly bar fishing so tossing the big stuff. And yes I did say ten to twenty ounce weight. The power in the water in the Fraser is unreal. There is a really good guide in chilliwack They focus mainly on sturgeon but are great for salmon as well on the river. I can't really think of a guide specifically for salmon or steelhead though.
