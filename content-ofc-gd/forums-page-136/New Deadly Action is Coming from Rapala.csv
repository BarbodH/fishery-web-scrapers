957946,Steve,2016-02-15 16:34:00,2075,"Rapala make fantastic lures.  The Taildancer series, J series (especially J11 and J13), as well as the X Rap series, are all best in class!!!  Once you upgrade the hardware you have fish catching machines.  (I also just started into the Rapala R Type planer board rods as well....quality build from what I can see so far)."
957947,manitoubass2,2016-02-15 16:42:00,11391,"The dt series cranks are top notch  Love clackin raps too(and its hard to find lipless cranks that run true in current)  I use 2 xraps, both white. 3"" and 4""  I also use the clown patter subwalk which is deadly for pike  Oh the xrap topwater with the blades on it, thats a hoot for tapwater bass"
957995,Garfisher,2016-02-16 00:11:00,229,"So while I was at the Spring Fishing Show yesterday I got to talk to Mike Iaconelli very quickly (2 minutes or so). I asked him if he would give a hint as to the new bait. He instead spilled the beans on the bait to my surprise. Now out of respect to him for being nice and just immediately saying what it was and what it does, as well as Rapala keeping silent about it, I'm not going to spill the beans on the bait yet (I'll spill them in a week or so). What I will confirm right now is that it is a new member of the Shadow Rap family."
958007,manitoubass2,2016-02-16 02:08:00,11391,So dt style scatter rap
958014,Garfisher,2016-02-16 03:30:00,229,Basically
958015,BITEME,2016-02-16 03:38:00,1968,#1 and 2 go2s for me if I lose 1 replace it right away have the in varying sizes
958428,Garfisher,2016-02-19 13:31:00,229,"Well, two weeks until the Bassmaster Classic, last year if you knew where to look the Shadow Rap was leaked about 3 weeks before it's official release at the 2015 Classic. So here's the new lure as to what I was told: The new lure is called the Shadow Rap Shad, it's slightly smaller than the Shadow Rap, but with a taller profile since it mimics a shad rather than a large minnow. The big difference with what it does is that it slowly rises with a nose up attitude, compared to what the Shadow Rap does which is slowly sink with a nose down attitude. If the Shadow Rap fades into the shadows, the Shadow Rap Shad rises into the spotlight. That is what I've been told, this next bit is just educated guesses. I'm guessing the lure would be a size 10 (4"" long) based on it being slightly smaller than a Shadow Rap. Depending on what plastic is used the bait could be up to 3/8oz which would be light enough for it to float. And I'm guessing the Shadow Rap Shad would have the same action as a Shadow Rap in terms of how it reacts when being jerked, it is in the Shadow family afterall haha."
958438,wormdunker,2016-02-19 14:29:00,1711,"Don't get me wrong guys.  I love the Rapala lures. I just have so many of them in my arsenal, I've decided to cut back on purchasing lures.  I will continue using what I have until such time I change my mind!  LOL!"
958440,Garfisher,2016-02-19 14:34:00,229,"I'm in the same boat lol, lots of lures in my arsenal but there's always something that catches my eye everytime I go to BPS. I really need to ban myself from there"
959590,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-25 15:40:00,937,Thanks for the heads up  I wish they made a bigger version of the shadow rap in sz 14 for pike
959637,adempsey,2016-02-25 17:35:00,1498,Looks like Bass Pro jumped the gun.  Assuming they posted the correct images.     Deep Version  
959642,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-25 17:54:00,937,^^^ Thanks for sharing  
959643,manitoubass2,2016-02-25 18:00:00,11391,Hmmm looks like a better walleye lure than bass lure
959664,sauce,2016-02-25 19:27:00,219,Looks like another winner for the rapala lineup. Got to hand it to them. Smart marketing. I have this feeling they will be great multi species baits.
959666,netminder,2016-02-25 20:16:00,514,"And wait till 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and more sure fire tackle to come that will make 16 stuff obsolete. Keep buying you dopes. Once my hooks from my 1973 F10 Black and Silver Rapps rust off and the lips are broken and won't take anymore Guerilla Glue I'll buy new used ones at the swap meet in Hamilton. Or I will put the gleep on a few of my fishing buddies because they never use them an they have a JY Yamamatsu 4D 719 Jerk Hammer Dive Slash Power Scented Nuclear Bait that they paid 17 bucks for and they saw Izumi hammer them on TV Saturday morning.  Believe it or not I don't have a Whacky Rig, yet. If the fish hit I'll stay with the 3 green garbage bags of plastic I have never used. Give me a Silver and Black F5 in Spring and a F10 Rappala in Summer and Fall and I'll show you a fish. F10. What's that supposed to be, old man? lol  I'll agree though, the original in a long line of anything is usually the best or near the best for a reason. Too many bells and whistles usually do nothing but raise the price. But they need to come out with something new every year to please the shareholders (note: I have no idea if Rapala is a publicly traded company)"
959667,Acountdeleted,2016-02-25 20:25:00,2562,"I had the pleasure of meeting an older fella at a lake west of Sudbury 2 years ago.  The old gent had fished this lake for 50 years!  He was 82 at the time.  I went to have a look at his boat.  He had 3 older fibreglass rods, paired with 3 Mitchell 300 reels.  He also had the original floating rapala in black/gold & silver/black rigged up to each rod.  You know what!  He came in with 3 or 4 nice walleye every evening.  I also used the original rapalas for many years as a teen ager.  Today they are in my tackle bag when on the soft water.  I'll remind you of my original post.  ""Lures are designed to catch fishermen""!!  My grandfather on my dads side used the Beno until the day he died. Refused to use anything else. And he did well.  It must run in the family because majority of the time, all I use is a crayfish colour crank bait or a chartruse jig. The other lures I buy because they look pretty so they sit in my tackle box. Don't think I tossed a single cast with the Live Target Black Crappie.  Oh oh! And a frog coloured hula popper. But thats all I use pretty much."
959668,manitoubass2,2016-02-25 20:25:00,11391,Yeah I mentioned something similar aways back. Not gonna be a successful corperation just producing 4 or 5 old lures  I wont be adding this one to my arsenal I know that much

If that's legit that is unacceptable from a company with the rep of rapala. I have a few that haven't been used yet. I wonder if I should just take them back."

960411,Steve,2016-02-29 23:14:00,2075,"In order for a company to remain profitable, it seems short cuts are taken. These short cuts have resulted in lips breaking off, baits cracking, and lesser quality hardware...starting back when the original tail dancers came out and the paint flaked off.....  Too bad....good Finnish company....."
957178,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-11 14:28:00,937,Anyone know what it is?  I'm a big fan of the Shadow Rap they released last year.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nnyVQbDMRg

957185,manitoubass2,2016-02-11 15:09:00,11391,"Its a stick bait that is designed to sink, then fowl, so it has retarded action on the retrieve???"

957434,Steve,2016-02-12 20:43:00,2075,"I can guarantee you one thing.  The bait will cost well over 10 dollars, likely closer to 20 dollars, will have fancy foil or other ""real life"" paint jobs.....  then will be built with the cheapest split rings and cheapest hooks China will make...."
957437,manitoubass2,2016-02-12 20:56:00,11391,???  Funny cause its true.  I use a few rapala lures and immediatly change those out

957599,scuro2,2016-02-13 15:55:00,904,I also wasted minute of my life and now I have negative interest in the product. On the integer line that would be a -10.
957642,Garfisher,2016-02-13 20:50:00,229,"My best guess is it's a new member to the ""shadow"" family, the Tackle Warehouse video with Ott Defoe has him say the bait name, but it's censored. However the 1st time he says it you can hear a ""s"" or ""sh"" pronounced before the beep comes in. It is a guess though haha"
957905,fishindevil,2016-02-15 09:36:00,6254,If it's anything like the shadow rap it's awesome !!!! I did very well with the deep shadow rap last summer for bass and walleyes !!!! Bring it on rapala !!!????
