960193,dave524,2016-02-28 20:37:00,4508,"62 F here right now , been really windy for the last day or so. Shore casting for browns very soon."
960195,G.mech,2016-02-28 20:46:00,830,"Apparently it was over near the Canal on the Keswick side.  People got out, car didn't....sounds like they were trying to pull it out though."
960202,misfish,2016-02-28 21:34:00,29133,"Some never learn. Then again, maybe they seen other idiots out there  and followed. This year of all, is not the best for car travel."
960203,Tjames09,2016-02-28 21:38:00,664,its 12*c outside? I didnt think Simcoe even got cold enough in the depth of winter to drive on it
960204,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-28 21:44:00,8243,"Thankfully no one was injured. Scary thought going down into a ice cold lake. I wonder if his insurance co. will cover the cost of damage? This question was raised in the past and I am covered under my policy under ""all perils"", my buddy called his provider and he is not under his bargain basement priced policy. He is covered for basically driving where vehicles were meant to be driven. Be careful all. I also wonder what the guy was thinking, or not thinking driving out there in spring like conditions today?"

960249,Canuck2fan,2016-02-29 01:28:00,1444,Glad all are safe.... Now fast forward to the fun of watching kijiji in the area for a deal on that make and model in a few days. Before it warms up and the car starts drying out and begins to reek.  Tell all your friends that deal on a used car might not be all that much of a deal LOL.
960269,Gallie,2016-02-29 02:21:00,1215,"I went down had a look, from what i understand he was sitting at the launch a while and people told him not to go out but he did anyway, he didnt make it far. The canal is only a couple feet deep so his car didnt sink over the roof thankfully, it was some fancy 130,000 audi so i guess lesson learned. Tow truck driver snapped both cables trying to get it out and smashed out his rear window. The car in the ice was destroyed after, total writeoff id say. He got lucky in my opinion."

960311,SirCranksalot,2016-02-29 14:29:00,3291,I'm glad nobody drowned but I guess it proves you don't have to be too smart to have $$$!!  Audi?? I wouldn't drive my 10 yr old Corolla on that!
960316,jimmer,2016-02-29 15:01:00,2730,He drove the car on the river????
960318,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-29 15:31:00,8243,"Idioto. I'm happy he wasn't injured or worse but he sounds like an idioto. Stupid people are the result of poor DNA handed down, it's not their fault really. Ignorance on the other hand is someone with a semblance of intelligence that does stupid things."
960319,G.mech,2016-02-29 15:36:00,830,"He drove the car on the river???? Well technically no, he kind of drove the car into or under the river"
960325,SirCranksalot,2016-02-29 16:17:00,3291,"Well technically no, he kind of drove the car into or under the river Glad you cleared that up!!"
