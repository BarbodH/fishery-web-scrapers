959123,bucktail,2016-02-23 20:41:00,1857,Hey everyone.. Just booked a week at Edgar Lake throught Air Cochrane for the first week in June this year. I was wondering if anyone has been there qand how they made out. It is right beside Kesegami Lake and is supposed to have good large pike and walleyes in it. Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks   \\Darren
