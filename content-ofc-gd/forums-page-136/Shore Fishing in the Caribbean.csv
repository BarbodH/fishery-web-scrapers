I always bring some fishing gear to be prepared if I have the opportunity for some shore fishing in the south. Unfortunately I haven't found an opportunity on the last two trips I made. On the last one to St. Martins I didn't see one person fishing from shore anywhere. What I did see was huge Tarpon swimming around, yet everyone I asked said I couldn't fish, that they were nature reserves. Wondering if people would share best destinations for shore fishing in the Caribbean. Maybe I can plan better for next time. Thanks"
959277,Shloim,2016-02-24 12:18:00,515,I go whenever we can afford it. My experience has always been. Shore fishing is tough. I've tried with a 12' rod a bunch of times and got nothing. Might be me however I've also been lucky enough to go out inexpensively with local fishermen and had a couple of incredible days. Good luck
959297,Locnar,2016-02-24 14:46:00,645,"I spent a month on Utila island and tried fishing numerous times. Lure colour that seemed to work best was shiny blue and silver. I found that shrimp on bottom was a great way to catch stuff, and you never knew what you were going to get. I liked to have my swim shorts on and some sort of footwear to protect you from Black Sea urchins... And then I'd wade as far out as I could and try to cast to the drop off which worked very well."
959317,davew3,2016-02-24 16:05:00,430,In St. Martin try of the docks where the boats go to Pinel Island or off the rocks In Marigot.  Check with Budget Marine in Cole Bay for fishing info.  I bought a saltwater pole there and they were helpful with fishing info.  Regards
959565,jimmer,2016-02-25 14:12:00,2730,"Like I said I should have asked before I went to St. Martins. I didn't see anyone fishing in Marigot, so I assumed it was a nature reserve area."
959872,scuro2,2016-02-26 21:07:00,904,Do your homework ahead of time. Check this forum out http://www.worldseafishing.com/forums/forums/rest-of-the-world.314/But mostly for the Caribbean it is experience...very different from lake fishing. Belize is a great place to go for DIY
959939,Duckie,2016-02-27 02:16:00,305,I have had success casting rat l traps using a 3 piece travel rod (I invested in a Loomis Escape rod) with a 4000 size shimano spinning reel in the surf using 12 pound mono. mostly have just caught barracuda and small jacks (this was in Antigua). nothing big ever. but have seen huge tarpon as you did.  while I was in the Bahamas (Nassau) I caught bonefish off the beach using bucktail jigs bouncing along the bottom: bonefish are my favorite fish. fight amazing and so pretty.
