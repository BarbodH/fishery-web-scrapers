960104,Acountdeleted,2016-02-27 23:57:00,2562,I think I gotta ask some whitefish and herring filleting tips. I got it done but it was no perch or walleye. Those fillets look perfect.

She loves store bought, but refuses to eat fresh fish that ive cleaned and cooked. !   Strong willed one she is...  I just fried my fish up and am heading over to the hospital to give my girlfriend a good fresh fish fry dinner.  She brought her fishing attire to work, and is getting geared up after her night shift at 6am.  Meeting me at the launch and going to fish for a few hours..  Officially addicted!!"
960113,misfish,2016-02-28 00:36:00,29133,"Looks great Nick   That looks like english style. One of my favs. Just I need to stay away from the saturated stuff. I my just have to try it if I get some in the morning. One dinner of that wont hurt. LOL  I could tell the dif between the herring and whitefish. It was funny, as lilly did too. Dosent like the herring, but the white fish she scarfed up."

960131,chris.brock,2016-02-28 02:08:00,4053,"If I was on Temagami I'd be in the hut, not on the computer"

960133,Terry,2016-02-28 02:11:00,14456,On a phone eating dinner. Got to get off the ice at some point each day

960173,JoshS,2016-02-28 17:44:00,729,Nice work out there. Looks tasty!
960023,misfish,2016-02-27 18:42:00,29133,"Ever since the first couple of weekends of this season ( when I was catching fish) all my buds have wanted to fish deep for lakers and whitefish. Hey to me it dosent matter, a day of fishing with buds is always a good day. With too many skunks for me, it was time to go back to what I wanted to do. FISH SHALLOW. I was the pie piper. Follow me, or not,Im going shallow.  There were 5 of us hooking up this morning at 6:30 . I was already to walk out, so headed out with my NEWFIE GPS. Dont laugh, it works, as you will see.I get on the spot and get the holes prepped for all the guys. Man that electric made short work of 15 holes through 10"" of ice. ( ya, still bragging about my set up)  Once set up, the fish where coming and going and coming and going, Finaly  they started to stay. I marked all morning. It was insane. They were there like at the start of the season. Man, I was kicking myself for all those deep water skunk days.  Got the first whitie on the small half an half hammered pretty quick. Followed by another. It was way to early to close up shop, so I released it. Kept fishing and managed to hook into 11 of them. Released all til the last one, that gave me my 2 limit for dinner tonight. Wanted a couple of herring to go with the whities, so jigged the mid colum of the water and managed to get me one.  Jer managed to get himself a small whitie and a couple of herring for his efforts and some small perch to boot. Nick got the same. Rob and Ron, managed to get some action, but didnt see anything for thier great effort. Theres always Sunday byes.    As always, great to get out with friends and fish for a half day. Ya half days like this I will take anytime.  Some pictures from this morning.  We set up a nice four corner system .    My buddy Ron ( known as Ryder Ron )    Rob ( Wall eyed ) and his cool smitty for his flip over hut. Rob, thats a great design bud. Aluminum frame will be wicked.      Nick ( NAW)    Jeramy and his have smitty will travel. I can only amagine what other travelers on the hwy were thinking .       What I was watching all morning    My rewards. NEWFIE GPS, spot on.    Get to do it all again sunday morning.  Play safe out there all.  B"
960026,NAW,2016-02-27 18:48:00,4022,"Great morning on the ice for sure.  Back at her tomorrow!  This time, I'm setting up on Brian's door step!!! Thanks for chopping the holes for us Brian, and for the extra help this morning!!"
960029,Rob,2016-02-27 18:56:00,467,"Yup I was playing ""roll up the whitie"" this mornin! Them little buggers are gonna get caught one day by me. Nice seeing you guys out there today. And thanks again for punching those holes Brian, that thing is so quite even the fish can't hear it.  Rob C"

960065,misfish,2016-02-27 22:12:00,29133,"This didnt take long. Original fish crisp, the fish and taters,  It,s how I fry for a whitefish guy. Malt vin and sea salt is all that it gets topped with when done.        Heres the kicker,,,,,,,,,,,,  My young lilly loves fishing , but gets grossed out when cleaning. Would never eat the fish. Well, she had a taste tonight.   Im lucky to get me a feed, as she was chomping it down quick. I was told, POPPY, get me some more.    And to think, she turned down nannies lassanga to boot."
960069,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-27 22:29:00,8243,"Absolutely fantastic Brian. It's so nice to read a good fish report from you ice guys. I have been sharpening hooks and sorting weapons of mass destruction all day.  You didn't have to rub it in with pics of a fresh from the water into the pan dinner, now did you? I guess I'll just have to wait, it's killing me."
