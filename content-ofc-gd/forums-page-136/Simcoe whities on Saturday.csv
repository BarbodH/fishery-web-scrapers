Love this thing...long gone are the days of me walking 3 km one way and that many back in foot or more of snow to get to where I wanted to fish. Did more than my fare share crisscrossing Simcoe on foot often in very tough conditions. All those guys buzzing by me with their snowmobiles or ATV's while I was all sweaty and tired on my way back dragging sled behind and caring bucket of whities. Couple times was lucky and kind fellow fishermen gave me a ride but 99% was hard walk....Anyhow...enough of that....this thing runs like a champ...looks so sexy with the new wheels and tires. Managed to equip it the way I wanted for ice fishing. Easy to convert to hunting machine for the deer season. Only thing is this ice season is a mess, but at least managed to test it couple times. Kids love it as well for more reasons than one ha ha  Best part - Even with the bigger tires it still fits in the back of my F150...nothing short of a miracle to all my more experienced ATV buddies....they  still can believe it. Very very happy....should have bought it earlier  Anyhow, back to fishing....started where I ended yesterday...got few and missed few but bite was less aggressive. Expected with the heavy fishermen traffic everywhere. Had to move...got some more and the final was 6/10. All on Meegs in various depths. Played around a bit with the ATV chat with some great fishing buddies great day despite the strong wind in the afternoon. Smoker will be going overtime tomorrow...                  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

960147,wormdunker,2016-02-28 07:07:00,1711,Nice whities!  The Grizz looks awesome!  You may want to consider a pair of chains for the rear wheels.  On glare ice the chains will give you lottsa traction.
