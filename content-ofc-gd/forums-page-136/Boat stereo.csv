960479,Dara,2016-03-01 16:13:00,3052,"Good to know that my reggae won't make the fish too chill to bite! I have found that Joe Walsh, rocky mountain way and some AC DC tunes turn walleye wild...I figure reggae will stop them dead and send them at a fast swim to the next shoal"
960480,Dara,2016-03-01 16:14:00,3052,How do I get the coffee out of my iPhone now? You need the waterproof case silly
960486,JoshS,2016-03-01 16:43:00,729,"Bluetooth speaker for me and a small am/fm radio for ballgames. I stream sirius radio or other services, it does eat up battery and data. I was considering rigging up a stereo but whimped out. Marley gets solid airtime in my boat too and the ""positive vibrations"" do help catch more fish."
960211,jjcanoe,2016-02-28 22:31:00,744,"Been looking at putting a stereo in the new boat, read a LOT of reviews online about different brands/models and have pretty much decided  on the Jensen MS3ARTL (it's the 3.5"" round one) Don't need a CD player in it and have somewhat limited dash space. Does anyone have this model in their boat and if so how are you liking it? Give me some pros and cons if you have any thanks! jjcanoe"
960222,HTHM,2016-02-28 22:59:00,4082,Just go to a pawn shop and use a car stereo if it last three seasons replace it again for $50.00.
960223,Fisherpete,2016-02-28 23:05:00,1814,"I'm intetested in this post too... Wife will come out fishing more often if tunes are available (yes, I want that lol!)  Pete"

960228,Raf,2016-02-28 23:09:00,3495,bluetooth speaker and a phone with your tunes on them or stream them.
960231,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-28 23:33:00,10439,I've been using a Pioneer car stereo in my boat for many years with no issues at all. I have installed it in the left side of my side console boat in a marine mount. Like this one.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/BKMCK2000B-Water-Resistant-Marine-Boat-Car-Radio-Shield-Waterproof-Cover-Black-/141502236938  
960234,jjcanoe,2016-02-29 00:01:00,744,"Have a high dollar Pioneer sitting in the closet, it won't fit with out some ugly dash modifications. Not happening on a new boat. No music on my phone (just on the kids phone....)  Also not happening! This will be mainly for hooking up MY satellite radio and local cottage country weather reports while I'm out on the water fishing"
960238,Tom McCutcheon,2016-02-29 00:31:00,627,I can't help with the size of the unit you wish to use. What I can offer is this...We use a clarion marine stereo with XM satellite. The stereo has been in the boat for about 6 years with no issues. One thing I would recommend is to get the best marine speakers you can. Works great for the ball games and hockey games even when we are in poor reception areas such as the French and Pickerel Rivers. Also good for tunes as well.
960242,jjcanoe,2016-02-29 00:49:00,744,"Agreed, quality marine speakers will be added, wiring is already there. My Pioneer is not a marine radio otherwise I would have thought longer about doing hidden modifications and just used the remote, but I want to do things correctly from the start. Know a few people with clarion aboard, nothing bad to say about them other than my budget lol. I've got a portable SXM radio, which I intend to bring along for tunes, cheaper than a second subscription that will hardly get used! I've seen these Jensens as OEM in many new boats including the Crestliner that I have, so I know it will look decent in there."
960248,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-29 01:20:00,8243,"I have found that there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a car stereo for a boat, cars take bumps and humps on the road too. If however you do moor the boat on the water moisture does tend to kill non marine specific electronics. For a boat being trailered I have changed my opinion on this and depending on your degree of audio fidelity taste a 50 buck stereo from a wrecker, Pawn shop or garage sale will do just fine."
960256,206,2016-02-29 01:57:00,563,I'm afraid to play music....it might scare the fish?
960264,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-29 02:15:00,10439,I'm afraid to play music....it might scare the fish?  You're probably right. Fish hate Justin Bieber!!!!!
960290,2 tone z71,2016-02-29 12:02:00,1311,"Jj I've been using the Sony marine package in my last 2 boats ,usually get it at west marine they come on now and then for 160 reg 199.00 hard to beat ,bass pro has the same last time I was there ,it's nice to have music in the boat"
960385,Dutch01,2016-02-29 21:47:00,1431,Do any of you guys with stereos in your boat think it negatively affects the fishing? Do you only use it while motoring from spot to spot or also while fishing?
960390,Tom McCutcheon,2016-02-29 22:21:00,627,"I've often thought about that very same thing Dutch, but I don't think the stereo/noise really affects my type of fishing....MUSKIE....If the stupid fish isn't afraid of the electric trolling motor and wants to take a bite out of the housing, I don't think the music will bother it. Then again, we don't have the volume cranked on it neither. Just loud enough to catch the scores and listen to the play by play. Sometimes, when we are up north and sitting on the dock, we will turn the volume up a bit, but not enough to disturb others."
960416,Fisherman,2016-02-29 23:47:00,7201,"I don't have that particular model, mines a Jensen JHD1910.  it's a marine unit and I put radio and speakers in a mid size ammo can, no dash on my boat it's a tiller.  If I'm alone I have some tunes and also tune in the weather channels on it. http://radioworld.ca/jhd910-heavy-duty-p-8979.html"
960417,Steve,2016-02-29 23:50:00,2075,"music does not effect fishing.  well, maybe mentally it does...but not physically.  I run the SUPER shallows for trout and while I cut my outboard and troll on my electric, I always play music.....it doesn't matter.  When I rebuilt my tiller lund I had a custom mount built for my marine stereo and speakers...."

960420,Mister G,2016-02-29 23:58:00,1429,"Just go to a pawn shop and use a car stereo if it last three seasons replace it again for $50.00. Funny you mentioned this because I took my old Saturn radio they gave me in 1995 when we asked for a radio with a CD player..........so I took this am/fm Saturn radio and mounted it under the dash so the face of it was sticking out just a little more out then even with the dash and ran silicone calking where the top of the radio met the dash.......that radio never have me any problems for the next 20+ years and got better reception then my new ""marine am/fm/CD radio from the factory. And the speaker were just cheap car speakers that I hung facing down under neath the gunnels.....nothing special and both the radio and speakers seen PLENTY of rain over the years.  The most important thing on a boat radio is the ANTENNA believe it or not......if you like to listen to sports shows or ball games while fishing get a good CAR antenna for the boat."
960421,Steve,2016-02-29 23:59:00,2075,Marley is a staple on my boat....  So far the fish just seem to bite more when Ja Rasta is blasting...maybe they get the munchies?  :)

If you really want the sound from a cell phone to greatly improve just place the cell phone in a ceramic coffee mug and hear the HUGE difference."
