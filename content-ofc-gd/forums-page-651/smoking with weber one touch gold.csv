489276,Billy Bob,2010-07-28 17:41:00,5865, Four hours should of cooked the ribs enough.....cut the rack in half and see if the meat is pink all the way through...pinkish meat shows how far the meat was smoked through...so if only the outer half is pinkish then it's only about half cooked (smoked). Another way I judge by is on a rack of ribs are the bones sticking out about a half inch or so....if so there done. Also under smoked ribs will be on the tough side while eating.  Hope this helps.

That will have a huge impact on your timing---the old saying ""looking's not cooking"" is one to remeber.  I agree--the bone ends should be showing.  Sounds to me like you have another 1/2 hour or so to go.  Keep it indirect and you're good to go."
