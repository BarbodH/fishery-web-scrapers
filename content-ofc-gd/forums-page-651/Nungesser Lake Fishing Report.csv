489819,kgeary,2010-07-30 06:36:00,82,"Hi David I'm not suggesting anything about you. I am sure you take no pleasure in trashing me and have no reason to lie. Yes I will take extra good care of OFNers.  One person (twilight) says I'm not making it clear who I am and that is not right. I say I'm not hiding my name because I dont' want to mislead anyone. Someone else says that is self promotion. Both must be right.   Nipfisher Yes I will take good care of you. If you want to find a problem, you probably will. If you want to have a great trip you definitely will. But let me know what your expectations are and I'll do my best Obviously I can't guarantee you fish You expect 801 fish for a group of how many? Seriously let me know  tcioz Thanks I think your right except I have been around for a lot longer that 6 years My family has been in the industry since 1949   Luc G thanks for your kind words I'm glad you enjoy my reports. Chugger and the rest thanks , glad you enjoy them.  FisH The Hodne group reported to me that they caught at least 800 walleye. that is a FACT and I don't doubt them at all . In fact I bet they caught more than that. I can't find where I said 30 walleye were attacked by pike I did mention 12 that I could recall.  FisH Nobody can control what others choose to say about them. Many people reading this thread are surprised by the forcefullness with which non- stakeholders express their opinions. I just keep reporting things as they happen. Some believe that I shouldn't. Some belive that I should and thank me for doing it. Does it help my busines or hurt it??? Apparently it makes you not want to visit my camp at any price. Others think it is a great offer. Some camp owners say I should never offer a discount are they right or wrong? It is a lot easier to sit in the weeds and take pot shots. That is why Pike are so successful.  I'm not going to get all Zen or anything but- There is a reason for everything. There is a reason my family has been successful in this indutry for over 50 years. When things don't make sense- there is a reason.  People will make up their own minds. If you choose to visit AK great - you will have a great time, if not then my family a lot of fish will miss you.  Just a quick note on staff I have developed a great staff It took a few years unfortunately a great employee and dear friend passed away a few years ago and left a gaping hole. His performance has not been easy to replace.  Have you ever heard of anyone working at a factory, as store or ________ who complains about their boss, the company, their job, how much they get paid,how hard they work, how much they want to quit etc etc. Consider this!! Why would it be any different at a fishing camp, especially where workers are seasonal???? I don't know anyone in business with employees that aren't complaining about their lot. Am I surprised that I'm a target here, of course not. Heck it makes me a target in my hometown.  I'm just a guy who took a huge risk and made a huge investment in a business that I love trying to make it work during the worst economy in our lifetime. Am I enjoying it? Mostly Yesterday one of my friends and guest asked my son what he was gonna do when he grew up Hayden said ""I'm going to run a camp and play hockey"". Am I glad I started it? you bet. Am I going to get bullied off this board? Not as long as there are people out there who enjoy what i take the time to write about  Hey gotta go I have guests and friends to fish with tommorrow. Oh and I will still try to get those pics on here tommrorrow."
489820,adempsey,2010-07-30 08:30:00,1498,"Personally, I do enjoy seeing all those pictures of big fish and smiling anglers.  I also believe I am educated enough to be able to draw my own conclusions when an outfitter or guide makes a post or recommendation that may benefit them.  I really don't appreciate self promotion and spamming resort links.  However, the rules for posting on this board are obviously set.  If the moderators don't see a problem with the posts then I don't think there is much else to discuss on that topic.  I do appreciate the feedback provided by the previous customers.  This is one of the most valuable resources available on this site.  I have probably saved a lot time and money because of it.  Hopefully Mr. Geary works out his problems and makes his lodge as good as it should be."
489860,Grimace,2010-07-30 12:44:00,2020,"When my mother asked him for drinking water he said the lake water is fine. Drink it.  In a miserable voice. I have been drinking it all my life and I am just fine.  One of his employees snuck my mom a jug of drinking water.  As far as making the best of it. We did. My father, mother and I did just that. We had a wonderful vacation full of fish, not because of Mr Geary but in spite of him. The things promised to us, drinking water, hydro, functioning boat and motor, friendly service were not offered. In fact the first thing he said about one of his long time employees when we landed was ""yeah, that guys not too bright"". After seeing what this guy just went through for this smug irritating man that just turned my stomach.  We were lucky, we won the boat lottery and ours was only down for half a day the first day.  Others were not so lucky.  Anyways like I said, I do not relish the thought of coming on here and doing this, it has clearly made me look bad.  I am not the guy Ron was talking about, nor Terry nor Gbfisher.  I do not know them.  So it sounds like it wasn't an Isolated incident.  The guests up there talked to each other and I did not meet one bunch that was returning.  Again the fishing was superb.  Just like at any outfitter in that area.  I will be heading back to NW Ontario, just not ""The Kingdom""."
489865,NAW,2010-07-30 13:42:00,4022," Not at all man.  On the contrary.  Geary, I'm not doubting the fact that your clients caught 800 eyes in one day.  What arks me, is there's people who have expressed serious concern about how you run your camp.  What I would like to know if what you are doing to make your camp better.  Not just another report showing big walleye and pike.  If you run your camp the way to respond to the negative posts in this thread (ignore them), then how is your camp going to get better?"
489869,kgeary,2010-07-30 13:57:00,82,This is getting ridiculous Yes I also have horns on my head and eat small children for breakfast HOWEVER I am still certain that readers are able to see what is really happening.
489875,Terry,2010-07-30 14:08:00,14456,"yes we do see that you could care less about dissatisfied customers are are only interested in the next client with a fist full of dollars  my only interest was the fact that I considered these post spam and your an Ontario business that only shows US price list, but now we are see much more to dislike about your business  and I think there is another camp on the lake OFNers might want to look into and still catch nice fish"
489886,Blue Lk,2010-07-30 14:38:00,337,"Regarding the 40% discount,I am sure there are lots of camps that will be in the same ""ball park"" during that time period(mid Aug/mid Sept).They are not that busy at that time & like to fill their empty cabins.Phone around if you are interested in coming up this way. Lac Seul is another great fishery and there are lots of resorts at both ends of the lake,Sioux Lookout & Ear Fall.This a beautifull area,often overlooked by fisherman from southern Ont. I would also like to add that I think the most reliable reveiws come from clients,not self serving resort owners.You can check out most resorts on the many fishing forums to be found on the web.The really good ones don't blow their own horns(so to speak)but let satisfied customers speak for them. IMHO"

489513,kgeary,2010-07-29 12:45:00,82,Hi twilight I'm not sure about you but Lew - you know very well there is no point in my addressing those comments. I've been thru this type of thing before.    fish 4 eyes - In January and February I've posted non fishing related items on here that were extremely unique and of great interest to ourdoor lovers and had nothing whatsoever to do with my business and I still received negative comments. I must add that I also received a lot of positive comments and emails.   Hi Darsky I'll give all OFNers a 40% discount on trips between august 14 and sept 15  I've had a bunch of OFNers visit and they had glowing reports.
489517,Sketty55,2010-07-29 13:01:00,52,"I've never been to a fly in or any type of fishing destination whatsoever. I keep saying i'll plan at least once in my lifetime....I would hate to read a report like this one, book the trip, and then find out it was not what I wanted. I'm not familiar with the lake, the accomodation, or the poster but I just think that although this qualifies as a report, the owner of a resort is somewhat biased. Glad to see that fellow OFNers have pointed out the relationship of the poster to the resort."
489527,WeedLine,2010-07-29 13:22:00,322,Keep those reports coming. Disregard all of these negative comments. I love seeing those big pike and walleyes. I'm gonna make it up there one of these days. This world is full of complainers. Shut up and FISH!
489532,darsky,2010-07-29 13:31:00,586,40% is quite appealing. Can we apply that to 2011 since 2010 is a bit rushed? I am sure said negative issues were resolved since...  I for one like the reports and pics. Save some for off seasons.
489558,kgeary,2010-07-29 14:31:00,82,Thanks sketty55 and weedline I try to make it very clear who I am with my name and my signature.  I used to be a minnow now I'm a NET ATTENDANT  Darsky yes we can do it in 2011 I can't do it in June of course. but the same time frame Yes of course all negative issues are resolved quickly.

I would think a sub section in the business section might be an answer. that way people know it's a promotional post....... and what about people promoting their business inguise of a fishing report and they don't have a banner and really only come here to make money"
489606,kgeary,2010-07-29 16:15:00,82, Hi Headhunter Thanks for the advice however I do need to point out.  I HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING WITH TJ for 6 years.  I have banner ads on this site and 5 or 6 others of TJ's I receive a lot of traffic from TJs sites to mine and I appreciate that.  I've spoken and emailed with TJ many times.

489633,Terry,2010-07-29 17:13:00,14456,"can you show me one..even one time that Lloyd made a post about catching fish.....his clients post all the time but not Lloyd not ever   as for steve rowbowtham, if you look at his posts, I think you will find that I never reply to any of his threads that are about his guide service, however he is a good member of this board and posts about many other things and replies in many , many threads..so because of that I overlook his self promotion  other guys spamming, I react on a individual case by case,..I use my own rules and they may or may not be better or worst then someone else, but I stick to them.......   as for taking it personally nothing could be farther from the truth if you reread you will see that I somewhat defended him as showed that he does have a banner, so should have some(undefined) leeway  do I take part in discussions ..you bet isn't that what these forums are for"
489641,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-29 17:30:00,2690,"Good points, Terry...as for Lloyd, as I'm sure he's told you as well...he never will post, believes that is entirely up to his clients. Took the family out for 1/2 day with Steve R...also a class guy, who made sure, as best he could that the kids had fun and learned something. I've noticed that a few other guide services that used to put up clients results, have stopped doing so.  Good for them!!  It truly should be up to the customer to post results, what better advertising is there than satisfied happy customers showing their success!!"
489645,johnnyb,2010-07-29 17:43:00,3413,"This thread may very well be proving that controversy is great advertsing...I'm definitely thinking about planning a trip up there.  'Course, the 40% doesn't hurt either"

I'll be honest I was sorta looking into taking a trip up there or one mush like it and reading the mixed review its a tough call though the 40% is a beauty deal and the fact of getting away is always nice."
489756,kgeary,2010-07-30 01:23:00,82,"I agree somewhat However I don't expect my guests to print brochures and attend sportshows for me.  This is a new type of advertising. But even in the old types of advertising negative talk about competitors never worked in the long run. You don't have to wonder who I am and what I'm doing (also I'm a dad and just can't help myself when it comes to my kids big fish or big adventure)  I try to make every post informative. Today was dead calm , the lake was flat. It was an absolutley gorgeous day but mile high skies ( you know) I knew some of my guests would have a difficult time So I went out and spent a bit of time with a few that were not doing as well. Others were just fine, Like the Hodnes who were well over 1000 by lunch.  I had Hayden and Dennis with me Dennis doesn't need much help but still appreciated it. I also had our cleaning lady Belinda, she loves to fish.  The biggest change I mentioned to people was to cover a little bit more area. I mostly simply anchor up and cast the areas even if it is 14-20 feet. Use 1/4 oz or lighter and let it fall on a tight line. The lack of wind makes it much easier. I spent a lot less time vertical jigging under the boat. Can move the boat a bit but not a lot and keep it slow. The nice thing about that is that the pike get spread out and you have more active walleye. If the walleye are laying flat to the bottom then there is likely a pike active right there. a good time to anchor up and work it for 30 minutes or so.  Most people would give up when the lake is like glass all day. I'm not sure how many we boated in 4 hours but I caught 70 and their were 4 of us, so?  Belinda had this nice walleye Hayden had several nice ones I managed this Giant walleye before we headed in for supper. Which was unfortunate because we were just on top of a bunch of big active walleye. oh well.  Sorry i will have to post photos later have some things to take care of kg"
489785,NAW,2010-07-30 03:08:00,4022,"This post is really frustrating me.  Someone totally slams the guy.  Actual reports of unsatisfied customers who have had their well being risked while fishing at this resort.. Potentially life threatening situations.   What does the resort owner do??  Posts again talking about his clients catching 800 walleye in a few hours, and attaches a bunch of pictures to boot....  And to top it off, says that 30 the walleye where attacked by massive pike!  Maybe I'm alone on this one, but Kgeary, You're deterring me from even considering your resort for future fishing trips.  Give me a 40% Discount..  I'm still not coming to your resort."
489796,Nipfisher,2010-07-30 03:40:00,2449,I'd like to go in 2011 at 40% off. Mr. Geary will take real good care of us OFC'ers or we'll post negative comments about him. I expect at least 801 walleye!

It would have been better if it was better.  Kgeary has mentioned as few times that he has not hidden his name.  Well that is because he is onto self promotion.  He has suggested that I am hiding behind a name.  My name is Dave Turple.  I booked a trip with Angler's Kingdom a few years back.  We got screwed but at the same time we were lucky.  Some guys did not have a boat for days.  Imagine driving 40 hours to not fish for a few of your 7 days.  The things I said earlier was true.  I have no reason to lie.  Weedline  You say to shut up and fish.  We are complainers.  I was raised by two wonderful people who have never been overly excited about luxury.  My parents just got back from a month and a half of tenting in Alaska and across the country.  My younger years of outdoors were spent in Algonquin.  My family does not need luxury.  I am going to work 10 hours tomorrow drive for seven sleep for 3 and fish for 12.  Without luxury.  Would you like me to pick you up?   I am one of the lowly construction workers they speak.  I used all of my excess income to go to this place.  Have not since.  Weedline.  My name is David George Turple.   Kevin Geary screwed me.  What is yours?

488491,kgeary,2010-07-26 14:35:00,82,"July 17-24 7/17 Overcast throughout the day with mild winds from the north east. Clear skies by the afternoon. Water temperature at 64 F.  7/18 Scattered clouds throughout the day, with occasional sunshine. Clearer skies in the late afternoon and evening. Soft winds from the south east with water temperature at 67 F. We fished a 14-18 foot flat coming out of 35 feet of water. We caught a bunch of nice eaters. Seanna had a 40 inch pike right up to the boat but it got off the hook. that slowed the walleye for about a half hour then had a 30 minute frenzy with several 20-4, three 26 inch walleye, a 27 and 28 1/2 All in all a pretty good couple of hours. Last Wednesday Seanna had a 35 inch pike come out of the water 3 times chasing her walleye. while it was doing that the other walleye started biting like crazy. A few minutes later another pike over 40 inches grabbed a different walleye, it let go beside the boat. 5 minutes later a third pike about 33 inches grabbed her walleye. None held on long enough to land but Seanna was thrilled. Every time the pike were busy the walleye fed voraciously.  In the past week I counted 12 different pike attacks on walleye. The Wolosak group had one they figure went over 50 inches grab a walleye and get right close to the boat. ( last year they had a big pike go after a 27 inch walleye they were netting and ended up in the net) I was releasing Belindas twenty eight (28) inch walleye and had a big pike come up and grab it.  7/19 Showers in the am with scattered clouds in afternoon. Showers resumed by 5pm. Mild winds from the north east.  7/20 scattered clouds throughout the day with light showers by the evening. Wind blowing from the north east. water temperature at 64 F.  Tim and Jim had a good day fising out of the sand flats and bringing in about 130 the largest at 25 using jig heads and minnow gulps.  Ron and his family had about 67 the larges at 22"" using minnows and crawlers. Also had a few pike. fished out of jacks hump.  7/21 Clear skies in the am with some scattered clouds in the afternoon with a little humidity. Mild winds from the north. Water temperature at 66F.  Ron and his family went out with Kevin today and had some good numbers. Plenty of eaters and the occasional size.  Tim and Jim had a great day hauling in about 137 walleye, the largest at 24"" and a few pike, using spinners, minnows, and worms.  7/22 Scattered clouds in the am and throughout the day. Mild winds from the north. Water temperature at 67 F. Ron and his family went out to sand flats and brought in about 40 then moved on to the wall with another 54 the largest a 24"".  Jim and Tim went out to pike alley and had several pike and about 67 walleye. Used gold spoons and jig heads with crawlers for the walleye.  7/23  I wanted to do a little exploring around the sand flats. ( The Hoekstra group caught literally hundreds of big eyes around the flats this week) however the kids wanted immediate results. So after dodging a small thunderstorm I went a proven mid lake hump. I spotted a bunch of big fish off the southwest corner and anchored up. Within minutes Seanna had a Huge walleye.  I had to return to camp to take care of some things for my guests. I continued to see a bunch of big active walleye and baitfish on the sonar unit. I rcognized the kind of thing you don't see everyday and didn't want to miss what was going to happen. I left my anchor in place and tied a small noodle on it. Dennis and Seanna jumped in with Hayden who tied his boat to my anchor rope so they would be in exactly the same spot I was gone about 25 minutes and in that time Seanna had caught 2 more monster walleye. Hayden had put them in the livewell so I could photograph them when I returned. So here is an unusual photo of Seanna with two Giant Walleye. Because we release all walleye over 18 inches this is a rare event. Hayden got in on the act and Dennis also caught two or three nice big walleye They also caught about two dozen nice eaters. All within about an hour. They were on the edge of the drop on the south west end of the hump all in an area the size of one boat. In 20- 26 feet of water. All on orange jigs and frozen shiners. When I returned and tied my boat to Haydens it altered the swing and moved them slightly off the spot maybe about 30 feet. No big walleye. As soon as I untied my boat and Haydens boat swung back into optium position Dennis caught two more Giant Walleye. This was a prime example of being in EXACTLY in the right place. When going over the map with my guests I've often said to people that when I say right here I mean RIGHT here. THE spot on the spot is often a very small area. Even on spots that I've fished often I will criss cross looking for fish with my sonar unit then try to place the anchor to put the boat in EXACTLY the place I want. Sometimes I need to reset the anchor 20 or 30 feet one way or the other to get the boat exactly where it needs to be. Big walleye action on these small areas is often for only a short period of time. So timing is critical and it is imperative that you ""stay on em"" Typically what is happening is that the walleye have a school of perch or ciscoes pushed up against the edge of a structure. They will feed voraciously on them and then the school is either eaten or scattered and the fish catching subsides as the big walleye move on. When you find them spread out over a large feeding shelf it can last all day while you catch one here and another 20, 50 or even 150 yards away.  7/24 Clear skies in the am and afternoon until about 4pm. Strong winds came in with out warning from the north east. Winds died down after about 20 minutes. Scattered showers for a moment, then clear and beautiful evening. Water temperature was at about 66 F.   "

It's onw thing if your clients put up a report, it's another when the owner of the resort puts up advertising er I mean a report of all the BIG fish caught!  Kevin, do you pay for advertising on this site by chance?  By the looks of the pictures, it must be pretty slow up at your shacks. Only a few groups coming up here and there..... BRUTAL!  One must ask themselves.... ""What am I doing wrong???""    Cheers, Ron..."

488727,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-27 02:49:00,2585,wow great report!  some really pigs there!  Cheers!
488731,Nipfisher,2010-07-27 03:00:00,2449,Call it what you want. It is still a report about fishing no matter who posts it.  What I want to know is there a discount for OFNers....like 50% off?
488758,kgeary,2010-07-27 04:21:00,82,"Yes I was only half full last week (This is not a big fancy resort with all the fast paced activities of such a place) But when I talk with dozens of other outfitters that are less fortunate than I then I ask myself ""what am I doing right"" and then I just continue to do the best I can and be thankful for what I do have.  Oh I just can't help myself. Sorry this isn't from my guests but here goes.  I went out with 2 of my guests for about 3 hours yesterday showed them 5 spots and then stopped to fish for about an hour. It did my heart good to see Alex - a nice young man catch this beauty on about his 4th cast.    http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/'>http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/  I went out with the family today. fished from 2.30 to 4.30 caught about 200 walleye in a few hours biggest about 25 inches. Hayden caught this nice little pike here is the pic    for all the details  http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/"
488782,Chugger,2010-07-27 12:12:00,109,"Nice gators!  On the ad front, there are many people that post on this board about taking their clients out and they all seem to post without getting flak.  What's the difference here?"
488867,Terry,2010-07-27 17:11:00,14456,"well if you are asking anyone that question  I complain about many using the board just as a way to promote their business ....this guy at lest(I think) has an ad here in the website so that is in his favor  but you don't see him trying to be part of the community like posting on other threads, he only self promotes  others don't have an ad and only post promotional stuff showing how well their customers are doing  then most of the guides at lest post personal fishing and reply to other posts and are part of the community   then there are a couple who never post about their charter service, except to offer open seats on the boat at shared cost only and only his clients post about the fish caught on their boats..the way it should be  lets face it as far as I am concerned, it's a load of crap, I mean spam unless it happy clients doing the bragging and not the owner of the company  but that is only my opinion ...  and right or wrong this is a discussion board and that's what I do"
488869,Chugger,2010-07-27 17:13:00,109,"Nice, thanks for the reply Terry.  Explains things for me a bit."
488884,Kinger,2010-07-27 17:59:00,351,"Thanks, nice advertisement."
489082,kgeary,2010-07-28 04:12:00,82,"I just read it again I think it has some very good fishing information. Most people enjoy other peoples success especially childrens success. ???? oh well It sounds like several people enjoyed it.   If you don't like it or don't want to read it that's fine why the need for a personal attack on me. ""shacks, brutal"" why so rude.  regardless I like sharing little bits of fishing info that might help others catch a few more fish.  Have you noticed that the weather stays the way it is during a full moon????? Maybe it's not such a mystery after all? stable weather of whatever kind has always been good to me.  The reality is whatever the weather whatever the fishing success, it is always a good time to be fishing. As years go by I enjoy teaching and sharing what I've learned over a lifetime in the outdoors especially with kids and even more so with my own children. Seeing them learn and enjoy all aspects of the outdoors makes the best of memories. I have no problem admitting that I'm proud of all of their successes.  Seanna can finesse a jig with the best of em. Hayden can drive a boat 16 miles down the lake and back without a problem. I try to share just a few bits of info each time on the water. It is amazing how much they have learned."
489236,Ron,2010-07-28 16:17:00,1683,"  The very reason why I commented on your post is because 2 very good friends of mine went to your ""shacks"" for a week's fishing and showed me pictures of their ""central heat"", missing fuse panel covers, boats not set up ready to go, being late on picking them up, staff up and quitting because of lack of guidance, no running water, did you want me to carry on with the list?  I thought we went through this last year or was it the year before?  A person or a group pay good money to go to your place and they end up with one of the worst fishing trip experiences ever. Not even as much as an apology or perhaps a gesture of a discount for the amount of screw ups for their holiday."
489249,Tarzan's Jane,2010-07-28 16:37:00,1183,  A few life lessons here .....  A while back you had posted and I clicked on what I thought was going to be more about your fishing experience (I really do not recall exactly what your report was about) except that I was somewhat offended when I saw that I was brought to your business site.  I thought it was rather sneaky of you.  Re-read what Terry and Ron have pointed out....and give a little more here to others before trying to fill your own pockets.  It certainly may not be what you intend but it does come across that way.
489258,Guest gbfisher,2010-07-28 16:59:00,0,"Frankly, I don't see the attraction. I don't see anything worth while booking a trip up there for myself. I do as well or better closer to home. With more fish species as well. I was out with a guy the other day who booked with you and he said he had the worst trip ever. A nightmare to be exact. I didn't get the whole story but I respect the person for his honest opinion. I'm sure ya can't please everyone but it's not like this person would be put off very easily."
489294,Grimace,2010-07-28 18:17:00,2020,I was up there a few years back. Met Dano there.  Solid dude.   First off they guy that brought us to camp got to the landing the same time we did.  He was to work at the camp. He did not know the river in nor the lake nor where the camp was on the lake. The wind was blowing high after a snow storm the night before. You did not send the big Jon boat for all the gear because it wasn't running.  So all the gear got jammed into the boats.  The gunwale was about 4 inches above the water. The waves were crashing over the side. The kid driving the boat was scared to death and told us as much.  When we did get to camp half the cottages weren't ready because you fired the crew.  The people that worked at the camp became the cottage building crew and none of the boats were ready.  Some people could not even go out fishing.  You went to town for 3 days and were unavailable.  I could go on and on.  It was a nightmare.  The lake is fantastic.  Blanket conditions walleye and the pike were big and mean but that isn't your doing.  Your end is the camp.  It stunk.    I was there the same week as Dano.  The staff were openly talking about walking out on you.  When you were there you were beligerent.   Ugh.  I hate to be so negative but it is what it is.
489297,Harrison,2010-07-28 18:40:00,2202, Whoa.... there's the deal breaker for me.  How far was the run?  Thats insane.
489316,Grimace,2010-07-28 19:26:00,2020,The river was ok because it was shielded from the wind.  He had to stay behind the other guy.  It was I guess about 20 minutes.  Can't really remember.  Than we put all our stuff into other boats and went on the lake.    At one point we were told to be the lead boat.  We were in 6 feet of water with 4 foot waves and rocks everywhere.  The guy said you guys go ahead we are going to put a marker here.  Our guy said are you kidding I don't even know where I am going.   It was insane.  It was a long time on the lake in those conditions.  My guess was an hour.  Prolly about 15-20 minutes in good conditions.  I just have to say the staff was great giving what they had to deal with.  The fishing was good though.  The fishing is good in alot of places though.
489440,danc,2010-07-29 01:50:00,4677,"We, the mods have been wrestling with this problem of self promotion for months and months. Certaintly there's good bang for your buck if you can promote your business for free on OFC. After all, it's one of, if not the busiest fishing message boards on the planet. But there are some perils that come with this free self promotion. We call them customers. They have the last word. Who better to judge your hard earned vacation dollars than real folks that have actually been there? I've never been to the ""Kingdom"". But I have lived in downtown Red Lake for the past 5 months. Nobody fishes in downtown Red Lake except us lowely construction workers. Workin 10 hours per day, each and every day doesn't give us a whole lot of time to fish. But besides the numbers of fish in Mr. Gearys reports, we're catching fish as big, or bigger without a boat every night. From our back yard. Downtown Red Lake. Anyways, you can catch a fish in a mud puddle up here. Weather or not you want to stay at a ""Kingdom"" is up to you."
489467,kgeary,2010-07-29 04:12:00,82,"Well 'm grateful that I'm doing some things right. It has been very rewarding developing the business and the many friendships that come as part of it. I've grown the business thru this recession. I have a good base of guests who have become friends and repeat customers Many come twice a year. Most of the groups in camp right now are here for the second visit of 2010 One group comes for 10 weeks. One is planning their third trip of 2010 for early September.   I was out with the kids for a few hours again today. Caught about 40 walleye in 90 minutes We fished in 11-14 feet. using jigs with minnows and worms worms seemed to have the edge. Seanna caught this nice walleye   Dennis caught a Monster Walleye in 26 feet of water on an orange jig tipped with a minnow.       Right after he released that monster I set the hook on a small Walleye and within a few seconds a huge pike grabbed it. I played with it for about 30 minutes but it wouldn't come off the bottom and finally spit the walleye out.  Al and Alex caught a ""bunch of walleye several 23-24 a 25 , 26, 27 and had about a dozen big pike grab their walleye. One grabbed a 31 inch pike.  they were fishing near the wall on a hump in about 14 feet of water. ""We're starting the get the hang of this lake - awesome""   The Hodne group has been coming twice a year since our second season. One young man they call Snowball caught his first 40 inch pike today, the rest of the kids caught about 800 walleye including a few 27's and several 25-26 worms on jigs were the rule in north bay today. ""It's just crawling with em as usual""  Domonic and his sons are up for their third visit. they caught so many walleye yesterday they needed a break and went strictly pike fishing. Haven't got their report but will do so tommorrow.  Roger hagan and his son and friends have been doing extremely well on their third visit. 27 inch walleye the biggest so far. they were fishing big hump most of the day varying from 14 -22 feet. I will get photos from everybody when I do the weekly report.  Here is Hayden with a happy look on his face. Can't see how anyone would not want to see that. ""priceless""  "
489468,kgeary,2010-07-29 04:22:00,82,Hi Dan Good to hear your enjoying Red Lake and Catching lot of nice fish. It really is a great place to spend the summer.
