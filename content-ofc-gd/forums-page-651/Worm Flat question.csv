489472,Hooked,2010-07-29 05:03:00,891,I'll be heading to Rice Lake mid August.  I was wondering if anyone here would know where I can pickup a flat of worms in the area?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks
489475,Spiel,2010-07-29 08:30:00,9065,Come to my house and I'll give you one or I can put you in touch with a guy out your way.
489478,Roy,2010-07-29 10:20:00,13728,You got to respect a dude who keeps an emergency flat of worms in his fridge.
489496,mbac31,2010-07-29 12:00:00,904,"Thats a whole lotta worms.   did not know you could buy them by the flat. Try Mc Donalds, they might have some extra."
489569,Roe Bag,2010-07-29 14:45:00,246,Bill's Bait 958 Upper James in Hamilton (905 388-lure). They recently moved to a new location just south of Mohawk road on the west side of Upper James. I get a flat from them every time we go to Quinte. Fishing World would be closer for you. Give them a call first. If not you can get them at Bill's for sure.
489574,Hooked,2010-07-29 14:58:00,891," Ok Chris, I'll let you know, thanks man.    Got that right Roy.   I'll be up there for 2 weeks and we'll probably go through 2 flats of worms, haha.  Mind you, there'll be 3 of us fishing.    I'll be bringing a flat up with me, but got no room for a second, which is why I wanted to purchase a flat up there.  Thanks"
489694,TC1OZ,2010-07-29 21:03:00,987,What does a flat of worms run a person? Anywhere in the niagara region?
489717,Ron,2010-07-29 22:32:00,1683,"BJ Tackle in Bewdley, West end of Rice Lake has them as well."
489726,bigugli,2010-07-29 23:01:00,6138,"Peter's sells worms by the 100, 200, and flat. A flat runs $50+ depending on availability."
489743,Radnine,2010-07-30 00:29:00,1538," Yeah, it kind of depends on where you are going on Rice (it is a long lake). If you take the 401 then turn off on hwy 45 for instance, there is a live bait place about two miles from the hiway on the left. I am sure he would have flats. And if you don't mind buying them by the dozen, there are loads of marinas/stores that sell them. Try PM'ing DiggyJ, he has a cottage on Rice. Jim"
489768,Hooked,2010-07-30 02:15:00,891,"  Perfect Ron, thanks.  I'll be at Tower Manor, so that's only a 10 minute drive.  And Jim, if BJ's doesn't turn out, I'll definitely check out that place you mentioned.  Thanks everyone else for you input."
489774,cwpowell,2010-07-30 02:28:00,265,"How many worms are in a ""flat"" of worms?"
489777,Hooked,2010-07-30 02:39:00,891,  500
489779,bow slayer,2010-07-30 02:43:00,1074," should be around  400,(thats what the local guy has)but I have seen them have as many as 500"
