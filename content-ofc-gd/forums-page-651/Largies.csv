489897,msp,2010-07-30 15:24:00,1336,Had a great day on the water chasing buckets this week. We boated plenty of fish on jigs. Heres the picture worthy fish and a picture for the tackle junkies out there.    
489899,TC1OZ,2010-07-30 15:26:00,987,"And my wife thinks I have too many rods.... I only have three. Boy does she have lots to learn.  Awesome pics dude, thanks for the report!  Looks like the dark soft plastics were producing, what did you catch that first hog on?"
489909,Spiel,2010-07-30 15:59:00,9065,  ....and I thought I had a lot of rods.   Those are some solid large largemouths.
489912,alexcba,2010-07-30 16:04:00,634,nice fish dude! those are some beasty largies.
489914,Harrison,2010-07-30 16:12:00,2202,"Giants, nice work!  Tell by the rods and mixutre of baits/colours your dialed in!  Only think screwy is throwing a jerk on a baitcast   You look familiar, do you go to the Downtown bass club?"
489915,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-30 16:12:00,0,Very impressive tackle and quality fish! Thanks for the fish porn!
489920,msp,2010-07-30 16:26:00,1336,"Thanks for the kind words. I tried throwing jerks on spinning gear and dont like it. I find I have the opposite effect. My wrist hurts more from spinning gear.....Baitcaster all the way. No, Im not part of any club, but I do fish out your way plenty in the spring. Only half those rods are mine. I thought that it would make a nice pic if we grouped mine and my buddys rods together."
489921,capt bruce,2010-07-30 16:27:00,820,"Some real nice ones there . Had to show wife picture of gear , she thinks Im the only one who needs that much tackle , hate retieing ,just reach down grab rod with bait allready on and keep fishing lol ... have one closet in house just for fishing rods .. But ask her why ????? 50 pairs of shoes , only got two feet lol thats when I duck and cover and grab sleeping bag and head for couch in basement lol ... Great fish you have them biggens dialed in for sure ..."
489979,SylvanOwner,2010-07-30 18:53:00,266,I could catch fish like that if I also had a rod and reel combo for every bait in my box.  Nice job boyz.....when's my turn?
490001,livinisfishin,2010-07-30 19:31:00,661,Awesome fish. What is the length of them?
490005,torco,2010-07-30 20:06:00,656,Nice bag of fish there. I also need to keep that picture handy when the wife starts nagging about how many rods I have. I typically only use about 3 different rods but they just don't get it.
490006,WeedLine,2010-07-30 20:18:00,322,"That's keeping the rods down to a minimum. You should see all of the musky, trout, and ice gear we have. I haven't bought a new pair of shoes or eaten a decent meal in years."
490035,steverowbotham,2010-07-30 22:04:00,1800,nice lookin buckets!  That water looks mint too!
490041,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-30 22:26:00,0, LOL. Thats when you know you have a fishing addiction!  Here's an idea. Why dont you start eating some of the fish you catch!lol
