489043,Minnow,2010-07-28 01:49:00,177,"Hey guys,  I have a question I really need some help with, I am planning to rent a uhaul 6 x 12 ft trailer to pick up 2 sleds from the states and was wondering if a 2004 Yamaha RX1 Warrior and a 2005 Yamaha RX1 Warrior would fit into this trailer? The trailer also does not have a ramp and was wondering what method to use to get them in there if they fit? Any help or advice is really appreciated    Thanks!"
489048,F7Firecat,2010-07-28 01:56:00,347,might be tight????  they may fit one forward one back but its gonna be tight.
489051,ctdd2006,2010-07-28 01:57:00,531,I doubt it!  Low decks...you should be able to lift them in...no different than picking up the back end up out of deep snow...maybe one in front ways and the other back end in first...but will be tight.
489081,Sinker,2010-07-28 04:08:00,8692,"I can't fit two on my trailer like that.  If you do put one on there backwards, watch the windshield. Take it off, or it will be gone.  S."

489411,danbouck,2010-07-29 00:16:00,4380,I don't think they will fit. I managed to lift my Mach 1 into my pickup without ramps or snow so they will get in there no prob.
489415,Terry,2010-07-29 00:43:00,14456,if you drive the first one in and keep it to the right back the second one in on the left  you might need to take the skis off the second one but they should just fit...if my math is right
489417,Pigeontroller,2010-07-29 00:44:00,2793,More options with an open style trailer...
489448,MillerPhoto,2010-07-29 02:10:00,147,"I would attempt nose to nose, and offset them each little so skis pass each other, and kinda tuck in under each sled, will allow more room if length is a issue.  Try looking up the specs from the manufacturer, they should list them online with the total lenght."
489453,ch312,2010-07-29 02:38:00,1590,"i say rent a bigger trailer to save the headaches as its going to be a pain loading them and getting them strapped down. they may be so close together that they could be damaged by bouncing/rubbing off each other.  i believe it was $130 or so when a buddy rented the same trailer which is a ripoff if you ask me. carter rentals is a lot cheaper and may have a trailer better suited for the job.  a small cube van from another rental company (uhaul is the most expensive) would make your life easier. but, im not sure how much it would cost..."
489459,Terry,2010-07-29 02:51:00,14456,"are snowmobiles not 8 to 10 ft long nose to nose in a 12 ft trailer would be 16 to 29 ft, might stick out the back a bit and almost 4ft wide at the skis  that's why back to back they will go side by side along the seats and an extra 1.5 ft by removing one set of skis"
489471,pike n' whities,2010-07-29 04:59:00,131,I dont think it will fit but ask for whoever to take measurements of the widest point of each sled and add em up. or look in the manual for how wide they are... if I was you i'd go for a 8'..... If memory serves me right that's how wide i'll have to go when I build my sled trailer this year.
