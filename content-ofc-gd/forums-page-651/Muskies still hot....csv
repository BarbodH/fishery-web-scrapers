488754,Fisherpete,2010-07-27 04:10:00,1814,"The 43"" gave a great fight, almost snapped my rod when she powerdove at boatside! No pics of the 34"", she was hooked badly and never left the water during the release process. The 40"" is on video only, I will post the video once I get it off Al's camera. Did a bit of bassing the docks too, got 5 largies, but all were only around a pound or so.   "
488756,steverowbotham,2010-07-27 04:15:00,1800,what an amazing fishery!  I always tell myself to spend more time there.  Maybe I'll go later this week haha

488831,Aaron Shirley,2010-07-27 14:33:00,655,Nice healthy fish with great markings WTG
488842,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-27 15:37:00,2690,"Spectacular 'ski, Pete!  Nicely done, as usual!"
488866,muskymatt,2010-07-27 17:07:00,2608,nice!!
488948,Pigeontroller,2010-07-27 20:49:00,2793,Thats a beauty!

489270,ehg,2010-07-28 17:26:00,2666,"Wow, that is a great muskie! Looks like a Niagara type 'ski. Nice job on the accurate measurement."
489271,jbailey,2010-07-28 17:32:00,866,verry nice
489391,Fisherpete,2010-07-28 23:02:00,1814,"Accurate measurement as in not exaggerated? I can honestly say that I have never, ever posted a fishes size with an inflated measurement. What's the point? They are what they are. It is usually pretty obvious in pictures when someone plays that game... If I ever get a 49.9"" though, I will either kill myself or pull on his tail until he gets that extra 1/10th of an inch LOL!!! I want to be on one of Terry's $50 bills!!!"
489443,corvette1,2010-07-29 01:56:00,1765,nice skis congrats
489462,ehg,2010-07-29 03:12:00,2666,"Just commenting that surely that musky is 43 in., often people will claim larger sizes for smaller muskies. A couple of nicer muskies i caught last few years were 43 inches as well and look a little different. Pigeon Lake open water ski's   43 inch is a good number"
489724,Leecher,2010-07-29 22:49:00,7832,Nicely done Pete You're having a great season so far and by the looks of it.... them ski's cannot escape your lucky lure Keep up the great work and thanks for sharing!!! Leechman
489744,Marko,2010-07-30 00:36:00,854,Pete you are on fire man!! Way to go dude...beautiful fish indeed!
489751,Radnine,2010-07-30 00:50:00,1538,"I can't imagine catching a fish like that. I had that muskie grab a bass that I was landing last year, and didn't know whether to crap or wind my watch! Well done! Jim"
