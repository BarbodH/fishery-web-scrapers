489057,xkempx,2010-07-28 02:08:00,84,"My report of a full moon fishing trip, Day of fishing with the 3 of us.  As I get the Boat ready to rock and roll heading for the lake at 3:45am.  The guys I'm picking up sleep in 1 1/2hr. I was alittle pissed,  Boat was running good, fishing was a little slow at 1st. FISH ON,   Bam a nice walleye maybe 22"" long, Bam spits the hook...oh well, As the day ends i load the boat and head home back to Kitchener.  Good times good tunes are rolling in the van, What next,  The Tire on the trailer blow, I'm' mean BLOWS....tire every were.  In the middle of Mennonite country.....And no spear for the trailer. 3 lug nuts come off like it was butter, But the 4th cant move at all.  3 guys later tried.     ""NOTHING"". . I have an idea.....?   I'll use this bar that comes with the stock jack....As I'm lifting up on this bar it folds and my hand is going for the FENDER above the tire.....Slice.....   4 stitches later.. on the middle finger..Of course i also hit the bone too.  As one of the guys hoops into the Van to drive to the hospital the Dodge grand Caravan whats to take a break at this time....No electric sing of life...NO indicator, break lights, speedometer...nothing on the van works, only the gas and breaks.....  Hospital is full to stitch me up...two many hours to wait with a boat sitting on the side of a road unatended....  After a few long hours sitting there wounding were I'm getting a spare tire with everything closed i had no choice to go and get my boat from the side of the road...you all would have done so too...   Shaking my head and looking at this whole mess....What now....   In the van i go, with a flat tire open cut finger and non working van...I drove 27 kms at a speed of 5 km-hr if that, A half a pack of smoke's later,. i come to this Horse staple with a few guy partying it up on there deck..."" Hay there you have a flat""  No Shiit, Pull in here and leave it here... "" wow thanks so much you guys save me from another 34kms..""  After a 6 hour wait ready to get stitch, the Dr says to me  "" when did you do this to your hand..."" i replayed with a SMILE 14 hours a go....."" What he said"" ...    I HAD TO GO AND GET MY BOAT i said to the Dr.  "

489101,lew,2010-07-28 10:38:00,12766," Sounds like you had a tough trip and good to hear you finally got everything fixed up, but I never could understand why folks tow trailers without a spare tire  10 minutes to change a tire and your on your way again."
