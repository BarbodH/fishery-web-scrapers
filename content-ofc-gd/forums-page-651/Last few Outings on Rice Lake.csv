489268,diggyj,2010-07-28 17:17:00,548,"I would like to share some pics of the fish that I have caught over the past few weeks. Most of the fish have come dropshotting either a SLAMMER Smoke Shiner or a Gulp Minnow 4 or 5"" in Smelt colour. Enjoy      Some fungus or disease on this one.         Unfortunate hookset on this one, small amount of blood.                          Dirk"

489380,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 22:34:00,0,Very nice mixed assortment of fish. Those slammers seem to work well! Gotta do more drop shoting. Only caught a handful of fish so far on drop shoting. Thanks for sharing.
489386,Fisherpete,2010-07-28 22:44:00,1814,"Nice collection of bass! I have been so busy chasing muskies that I have given my home lake (Rice) very little fishing time this year... after seeing your post, it may be time for a visit!"
489388,ozaibak1,2010-07-28 22:52:00,401,"Nice reports and fish thanks for sharing. It's weird, I've caught so many fish on pink senko kut-tails, but still have yet to catch one on a pink stickbait senko... just gotta keep trying I guess! I've noticed lots of biggies in posts caught on the pink stuff."

489660,diggyj,2010-07-29 18:34:00,548,"Have caught a bunch but they are in the 12-14 inch range. Havn't caught one slot sizer yet, although I haven't targeted them. Im a bass guy.  Dirk"
