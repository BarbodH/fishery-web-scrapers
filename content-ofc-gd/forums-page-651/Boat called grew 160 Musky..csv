489214,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 15:04:00,0, Woah!$500 is a little steep. Maybe if I planned on keeping it for a long time I would consider it. But its good to know for future considerations. Thanks.
489219,John,2010-07-28 15:26:00,2956, Not sure where you got the $500 from. KeelShield should be less than $50.00.
489244,MuskieWannabe,2010-07-28 16:30:00,79,"Just to clarify, the boat is 1495 lbs...even if you take away the motor you are still looking at aroun 1200lbs, if not a bit more.  I think your 600lb is way off, just check those specs again....  As a sidebar though, it does look pretty good.  Sometimes those basic boats are the best."
489247,Terry,2010-07-28 16:35:00,14456,I believe the boat itself does weigh 660 but the 1495 lbs is based on the boat/motor/half a tank of gas/all accessories/ fishing tackle/ and two men and their supply of beer
489254,lew,2010-07-28 16:53:00,12766," I forget exactly John, but the KeelShield for my Skeeter was around $200 and I had to install it myself.  Their certainly not cheap but should protect the glass if I decide to beach it for whatever reason.....hopefully."
489255,Flappn,2010-07-28 16:55:00,245,I have a 1989 Doral 16FT Fiber glass boat and it's dry...does not leak at all. I would say you can only make a decision knowing the application your going to use it for. An aluminum boat being dragged on shore over stone's and rocks in time will cause issues as well. With Fiberglass unless you gouge it or put a hole in it....I don't see how it would ever leak. The Hull Guard is a great idea.  I have had both Fiberglass and Aluminum and I have to say that the fiberglass in the similar comparison is heavier and the one piece solid construction allows it to handle the waves/rough water better (I would say this applies to 15-17ft boats). I don't however beach my unit to swim....I just jump out in the middle of the lake and climb back in when I'm done. I would hate to even drag a new Aluminum unit on land...but I am very Anal when it comes to things like that. I have had Rivets pop and that's not fun.
489378,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 22:24:00,0, The link he supplied says $449  http://www.bridgeyac...?product=KS12WH  I'm pretty sure the boat specs said the boat is exactly 660lbs.  http://boatlandcanada.ca/index.php?option=com_boatcom&Itemid=277&task=specs  Some girls I bring fishing can't swim so we have to beach the boat.
489413,GBW,2010-07-29 00:42:00,8460,"Yeah Johnny, but others sell it or something like it.  I gave you the link to them because you said there are no dealers in Canada and they have a web site."
489451,John Bacon,2010-07-29 02:24:00,3277,"If you are only planning to keep a boat for two years, you may want to consider buying second hand.  Otherwise your going to take a big hit on depreciation.  A two year old boat will sell for a lot less than new... a seven year old boat may not be much cheaper than a five year old boat."
489589,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-29 15:30:00,0," Yes but your already getting a deal and a half.I can still sell it for a good price) I've been looking for a few months now and even used? People want too much for their rigs. The ones that are great deals are priced around 20G's.(give or take). My bro wanted to spend around 10G's give or take.  Anyways, I'm not sure if my bro is going to buy it now. Plus I dont think I will be doing much fishing this season. I'm due for surgery to the thumb in 2 weeks and it will take 8 weeks to heal."
488881,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-27 17:55:00,0,Anyone ever heard of these boats? They are really cheap. Sounds like something has to be wrong with it.What are your thoughts? Its fiberglass but it only weighs about 660lbs??? Nice front and back deck and the livewell looks decent.  http://boatlandcanada.ca/index.php?option=com_boatcom&Itemid=277&task=desc
488883,danbouck,2010-07-27 17:58:00,4380," Grew made some good boats, i didn't think they were around anymore"
488886,ctdd2006,2010-07-27 18:07:00,531,I too thought they'd gone belly up!  Their older bowriders were great boats.
488887,Terry,2010-07-27 18:12:00,14456,I can't even find this boat on grews website  you can see it is a very simple boat not fancy at all
488896,Bigfisherman,2010-07-27 18:42:00,100,"I think its made by the same manufacture that makes cutter boats, pretty reasonably priced for what it is. I'd have to see one in person, and test drive it too."
488897,johnnyb,2010-07-27 18:44:00,3413,"Grews are still around...lots and lots of them on Gull Lake in Minden....Canada's highest volume Grew dealership is down the road outside of Kinmount.  Good boats...never seen a fishing model tho. Try WALSTEN MARINE, JohnnyBass...they might be able to hook you up."
488899,GBW,2010-07-27 18:47:00,8460,http://grew.ca/CutterBoats/2010Boats/160Muskey/index.html Grew does make a good boat.  I have a Northstar and if I were to buy that very same boat today it would be called a Grew. *edit* I may be wrong but I think Northstar became Grew...
488903,fishnsled,2010-07-27 19:06:00,3520,A bit more info here.  Cutter - 160  On the Grew site it is listed under the Cutter boats.
488905,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-27 19:11:00,10439,"Seems like a pretty good price but I would go for at least a 60hp motor (it's rated up to 75hp) and a 55# trolling motor on it. Grew has made some good boats over the years. I also thought they were gone, but I guess I was mistooken."
488911,g_clot,2010-07-27 19:32:00,104,Nice looking boat for the price.  (dreaming of richer days)
488945,Michael_Brown,2010-07-27 20:48:00,411,"A good looking boat, with some decent options, made in Canada for a fair price....what a concept.   I had a good look at one of these last spring and it seemed a good deal, plus they are made right here in Ontario. Strong selling feature for me."
489004,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-27 23:52:00,0,"Thanks for all the replies. Seems like a great deal.  But 660lbs and made out of fiberglass?  Apparently it handles waves better than an aluminum but that is the word of a salesman.lol  Comes with a 40 h.p 4 stroke. The only thing is I only want the boat for a year or two, then I want to get an 18+ footer with at least a 75h.p. but not over 90h.p.(burns too much gas).  I'm not sure I can get anything for this boat after a few years."
489016,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 00:47:00,0,One more thing. A fiberglass boat(as opposed to an aluminum) is less likely to leak after 10 years. true or false?>
489024,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-28 01:06:00,947,Both types of boats have there pro's and cons.  Fiber Glass is great but if scuffs or gouges aren't repaired Osmosis can occur.  Riveted or welded boats could crack or could have leaky rivets.  All depends on type of warranty is given on both
489033,buckster,2010-07-28 01:20:00,530,johnny if in the future you are looking to get an 18'+ boat.  A 75 isn't gonna cut it.  You should be thinking 115 ish. fuel will probably run you more with and under powered 75  
489137,g_clot,2010-07-28 13:00:00,104,In a few year I might consider buying it used off ya....
489150,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 13:16:00,0,"  I like to ground my boats on shore to go for a swim or what not. Then a riveted aluminum would be better, if I hit small rocks and stuff and the boat gets scrapes?"
489195,GBW,2010-07-28 14:26:00,8460,you can get a hull guard.
489198,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 14:34:00,0,Whats a hull guard. How much does it cost and where would you buy one?
489202,GBW,2010-07-28 14:41:00,8460,
489204,GBW,2010-07-28 14:43:00,8460,There are 8 dealers in Ontario too I just found.
489207,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 14:47:00,0,Thanks. No price and nothing in Ontario. I guess I would have to order it. Not sure I want to add too many accessories to the boat. I'm already adding a lowrance fishfinder/GPS if I grab it. Don't know how much the maps(the chips) are going to cost me though.
