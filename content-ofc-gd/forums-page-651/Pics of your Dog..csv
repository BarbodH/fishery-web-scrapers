Of course there is the odd time he gets a little too excited and launches off the bow LOL. He can't resist water.......even if its just a puddle in the driveway!!  Catch of the day!

Gus is my first dog and I already think about how hard it will be when he passes on.    It's always tough to let them go but the way that I look at it is the years we have together with them more than makes up for the heartache.......

Despite being abused she is the most loyal and lovable dog I have known. 15 years old and just starting to slow down. She has been surrogate mommy to every puppy and kitten to enter our doors. Even when she really did not want to. Harlem kept trying to suckle the old girl for about 6 weeks and she just put up with it.  They know when to line up for brekkie  I have to thank Hammercarp for the nickname. Quite an appropriate title for little Peanut as a ""Scandinavian Fish Retreiver""   Last, but not least, we have Ruffins. A loveable rascal in our home for 3 short years, but I was forced to put him down. Found out later he was the product of a puppy mill. My kids still have not forgiven me.
