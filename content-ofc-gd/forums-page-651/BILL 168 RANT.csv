Read up.  http://www.iapa.ca/Main/Articles/2009_workplace_violence.aspx  They start of talking about a disgruntal husband, coming to the plant and shooting his wife.So now  all the doors have to locked. If you know me,I stand up and say to the main man,so what does a locked door have to do with it? If Im going to enter a locked door and Im in a deraged mind,Im going to blow the lock off with a few shot from my shotgun,enter,reload and have my way.He has no  sense of humor   .Whatever.It,s a fact this could happen.  Cant talk about a girl/guy that works with you ,as this is offencive to them if they hear you.Cant even say,he/she needs BO powder.JOKE.  Now comes the pics on your tool box.

489765,AzuluSpookd,2010-07-30 02:03:00,348,"Brian...government policies and procedures have little weight in my world....however...it has long been known that one of the most powerful acts is the Health and Safety Act....MOL decisions have major impacts across the province and have alot of weight, particularly in government run buildings....this is why Bill 168 was created and placed strategically into the HSA under two components WDHP and WVP...It really is a good thing, but like many good things can be abused...but if they can filter out the abuse, it will be a good thing for employers and employees....threats, intimidation, bullying from Manager v Manager, Manager v Employee, Employee v Employee, coworker to coworker, although there were some policies that covered this, by placing this into the H & S Act will certainly carry alot of weight allowing employers able to deal with these occurences efficiently and effectively, resulting in strict discipline to possibly being terminated. We all know that stuff (discipline)rarely happens in a unionized environment, but Bill 168 under the H & S Act will make all employees accountable for their actions.  I've seen it already, an incident that occured 3 weeks ago, probably would have been swept under the rug pre Bill 168...however..thanks to Bill 168 and the obligation to notify the JOHSC....7 day suspension....  I think we should all look at it as a positive thing, for everyone."

No different than kids dealing with the tattletale after school.  Beyond that, we have sex, porn and smut all over our daily lives in print, images and telemedia, yet we will try to bowdlerize people in the workplace. Talk about asinine."
489836,bushart,2010-07-30 11:26:00,2628,Brian---History has taught me one thing on this.  Give anyone a right to do something (in this place make you take down your sunshine girl)  And they will excercise it!!  It's a power trip---that tiny bit of authority they'll ever get.
489852,crappieperchhunter,2010-07-30 12:27:00,2582,As I get older things at work just roll off me like  water off a ducks back. I treat people with respect and do my best to ignore those who are just looking to aggravate me. I am always the first person to change the topic or walk away if someone at work is trash talking something about work. Someone says this is our new policy I give it a listen and after a bit of thought voice my concerns if I have any and then just accept it going forward. It's really that simple.  Out of work things are a bit different. But at work I'm getting paid to be productive and do my job. So that's what I do. All the rest is just clutter.
489856,JohnF,2010-07-30 12:37:00,3494,Never forget that no government will ever get credit for addressing a problem unless they give us a concrete solution to see. It really doesn't matter about the viability or practicality of the solution. The important thing is for them to have restrictive measures in place.  The fact is that many of our laws really matter only to the law abiding. Those who aren't law abiding could care less about the laws and penalties. It's just one more thing to work around for them. In fact there's some thought out there that tighter regulations simply give the lawless a bigger sandbox in which to play.  JF

490016,mbac31,2010-07-30 21:07:00,904,"I agree with ya B. This is getting silly now. We have meetings with our guys monthly about all this stuff. Oooohh my feelings are being hurt or I dont like that comment or whatever, lighten up Francis. Its no longer a mans world IMO. Its only going to get worse"
490024,misfish,2010-07-30 21:38:00,29133," Kind of what came to my mind Bruce. Not that it,s the right thing to do,but it will come down to it.You rat someone out that dosent give a rats ass,he/she is going to get even.To me,it,s making it worse.       Like Bruce mentioned Marty,thats  what could result from this. It,s a double edged blade.  As for doing this in a union shop?Rats are dealt with swiftly."
