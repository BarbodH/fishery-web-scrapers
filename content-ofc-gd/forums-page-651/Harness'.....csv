Just had a general question (which I can't remember if I've ever posted before; tried doing a search but wasn't very helpful).  Anyway, a couple months back my uncle and I went fishing @ Centre Island. While we were there, we saw these guys playing Frisbee Golf (Frolf as its called). and while watching them play (while walking the shoreline)... we've noticed them carry a ""Frolf Harness"". Which gave us the idea of using those to carry our lures around in (instead of those single straps) while walking from spot to spot. It would help A LOT on our shoulders to carry as a BACKPACK as opposed to a ""over the shoulder"" style type of deal... anyway....  My question to you guys is...  1) Has anyone tried using one of these before? (to carry your lures in) 2) Are there hareness' out there that'll be strong enough to carry a bag weight up to 15lbs?   Here are a few links to some sites I've found...  http://www.everythingdiscgolf.com/Backpack-Dual-Harness-Strap-p-4867.html  http://gottagogottathrow.com/discgolf/fade-gear-weather-guard-harness-system-p-2082.html  http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/53738-REG/Tenba_632_108_5001_BPH_L_Backpack_Harness.html   I'm particular to the 3rd link - it looks to be more ""sturdy"" and ""secure"" in carrying more weight. I understand its supposedly designed for ""Photography"" use... but thought I'd replace the clips with Carabeaners or something.  Anyway, if anyone can shed some light on this - It would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!! Rob (A2F)"
