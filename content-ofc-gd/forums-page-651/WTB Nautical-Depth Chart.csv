Anyone know the best place for me to get one of these from? I wouldn't mind the digital download as I can use it on my friends ipod...but I'm sure a map would be better. I don't mind paying for it, just don't want to over pay for a map or get one with information I don't need.  I currently don't have a nice GPS on my boat (hoping to get a fish finder soon...) but I wanted a map of the area so I don't have to waste too much time just learning the depths by trial and error. Hopefully I don't sound like too much of an idiot, but finding good spots to start would be easier I think what a depth chart.... (or at least I think it would be)  Thanks in advance.  Terrance"
