When I connect the the charger connections to the corresponding coloured mount, I get a red LED saying ""SHORT/REVERSE"" instead of ""CHARGED"", or ""CHARGING"".  I tried reversing the connection and  the same result.  Any ideas???  Do I have to completely drain the battery before I recharge it?  Thanks for any help,  Paul  The battery is a 12volt 7Ah."
488880,alexcba,2010-07-27 17:52:00,634,"if its the same as my portable 160 (wall plug with led) i once drained the battery on it completely. the red also means your very low on juice. i know when i plugged mine it, it was red after that, i left it for a few hours and it turned from orange/yellow, to green on the charger.  ""just set it and forget it"""
489131,ironstone74,2010-07-28 12:50:00,201,"Cool, thanks I'll give that a try!  I emailed Humminbird also to see what they say.  Paul"
489133,livinisfishin,2010-07-28 12:54:00,661,"I have the 160, absolutely love it! Same deal with the battery, just left it and it was fine"
489189,Fisherman,2010-07-28 14:17:00,7201," Take your handy voltmeter and see what the actual resting voltage is, maybe the battery is borderline toast, and make sure the battery is correctly connected."
489438,ironstone74,2010-07-29 01:47:00,201,"Thanks guys, it's been charging for 6 hours now and is still red    I'll see how the charge holds up 2morrow!!!  Paul"
489455,livinisfishin,2010-07-29 02:43:00,661,Sounds done :s ! Any idea on the cost of a replacement?
489490,Fisherman,2010-07-29 11:41:00,7201,"Ah, about $25-30, your local battery shop will carry them."
489494,Roy,2010-07-29 11:54:00,13728,"I've told this story a dozen times here but....a long time ago, I had an Eagle Ultra or whatever it was. I had converted it to being portable. I was mostly running it when I was in places where I could not bring my own boat in. The security system in the house used a 12V, 7.5A battery backup plugged into a transformer that would keep it charged. I had 2 batteries and whenever I went north to those lakes, I'd simply swap out the fully charged security battery for the other. It would last me 3-4 days on the water and when it was time to go north again, I'd simply swap them out of the security system again. The batteries were always fully charged."
489497,ironstone74,2010-07-29 12:00:00,201,"All good!  It took 7.5 hours to get a green.  Instructions should be more clear.  Let's see if it can lead me to some beauties in the canoe AKA ""bassboat"" today. Haha.  Paul"
