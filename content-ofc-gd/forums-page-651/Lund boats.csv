488805,Lunker777,2010-07-27 13:41:00,866,Hey everyone...  Just curious if anyone is familiar with the Rebel series or the Alaskan  series of Lund boats ??  Also... Tiller or Console ????
488830,troutologist,2010-07-27 14:31:00,951,"2 different styles of boats to fit differing niches in the market.  The rebels are finished fairly well and come with alot of options for their price point.  I would say they are narrower than most of the Lund line.  Alaskans are a different animal altgether.  They are a utilitarin boat, the all vinyl interior cleans up easy and the open layout is meant to haul loads.  Again a narrower boat, but still great with most of the option available on the more expensive Lunds.  Tiller or console...the great debate...how do you fish? Where do you fish?  If you are mostly fishing walleye and backtrolling tillers are nice, they give you great control and piles of room, especially if you are looking into a smaller boat.  The downside is weather protection in fringe seasons, though Dufort Industries can make a complete sport dodger top for your Lund tiller that snaps into the sport/protracks.  Ski goggles or a sled helmet make cold weather runs comfortable.  The same control can be gained backtrolling with a kicker or vantage on a console boat, however in high winds the windshield/consoles will catch more wind, and make things difficult.  If you troll for muskie in december, a windshield, full top and heater make things nice.  Spouses, youngsters tend to appreciate getting out of the weather.  I run a tiller, because I feel windshields (and rod holders) are for wimps. Can't say enough about my Lund and their service."
488879,wkrp,2010-07-27 17:48:00,656,I`ve  owned a Rebel since 2002 and have been extremely happy with it . Told the wife she could bury me in it
488908,doubleheader,2010-07-27 19:20:00,497,I owned an 18' Alaskan wheel boat. As was mentioned it's a no frill boat but mine never leaked and was a great boat. The only thing I didn't like was it lacked a casting platform.

489302,ottawaguy,2010-07-28 18:46:00,11,"I have a 2008 Lund Rebel 1625 XL SS, side console, it is a very stable boat and is wide enough at 84 inches.  The non XL version of the Rebel is narrower.  You can also get the boat now in a tiller version. Great boat for fishing as well as bringing the family and friends out.  If you would like to know more about the boat PM me.  Below is some info on the 1625 XL  http://www.lundboats.ca/boats/2010-lineup/rebel-boats/1625-rebel-xl-boat  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=21036  http://www.boattest.com/Partners/Partner-Main.aspx?lp_id=3211169&t=BOAT-TEST&Videoid=2250&p=0&s=  http://www.boattest.com/Partners/Partner-Main.aspx?lp_id=3211169&t=VLIBRARY&Videoid=2150&p=0&s=  http://www.boattest.ca/test/229/2009-lund-1625-rebel-xl-ss.html"
489488,Chris,2010-07-29 11:16:00,405,My Lund Sendero 1650 is very similar in size (but with full windsheild) and I love it. Very stable and economical.
489504,buckhorn250,2010-07-29 12:15:00,85,"I've had a Rebel XL for 3 years and for an entry level fishing boat I've been extremely impressed. Feels solid and stable, but its size lets you get into areas that you may not be able to access in a bigger boat. As mentioned the finishing isn't bad, so it works as a family hauler too. Gerat bang for your buck."
489529,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-29 13:28:00,2050,"you didn't seriously just bring up the tiller versus console debate did you? haha just kidding dude. I have no input on these boats, but good luck!"
489535,danbouck,2010-07-29 13:34:00,4380,"IMO You can't go wrong with any Lund. For the great debate, If you have a wife and kids go console if not go tiller"
489540,Lunker777,2010-07-29 13:46:00,866, ahahah I thought the board could use a little debate !!!!!  Thanks for all the input fellas !!!!
489889,Calender Don,2010-07-30 14:53:00,39,"I bought a new 1625 Rebel XL SS this year, I got the back seats added when it is folded down bigger deck at the back of the boat and I have a 60hp 4 stroke great boat and easy to tow."
