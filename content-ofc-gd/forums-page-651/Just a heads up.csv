488765,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-07-27 09:08:00,1107,I had a spool of the firewire crystal that was horrible 65lb and a big husky jerk broke it off mid cast with no back lash also lost a bulldog and a big spinnerbait from breakage by far the most expensive spool of line I have ever used after losing all 3 lures. pretty sure it was just a bad spool but that was the only chance I was giving it .I have been using the cajun braid I have 2 rods spooled with 65 lb and 2 with 20lb and have no complaints so far and it was $23 for 2 spools of 200yrds I believe.
488767,steverowbotham,2010-07-27 09:50:00,1800,"IMO Power Pro is far and away the best braid out there, but I have heard nothing but good things about Spider Thread ... not to be confused with Spider Wire.  I had nothing but issues with both SpiderWire and Fireline.  I'll stick with what works and use Power Pro til death do us part."
488780,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-27 12:00:00,932," Yep, that's what I'm doing and I have NO reason to change.  I have two friends that claimed the same thing a few years ago and they're still on the Power Pro as well.  And just a heads up - Power Pro is on sale at Canadian Tires as well - $19.99 a spool.  This isn't an outrageously great sale, but it's still cheaper than MSRP.  A tackle shop I frequent always has PP @ 19.99."
488795,Headhunter,2010-07-27 13:15:00,5703,"May I suggest that you use Floro on your spinning reels... I have had nothing but great luck/success witht he stuff. Used in the right application, I think it's great! HH"
488809,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-27 13:44:00,947, LOL.  Sorry this is funny
489749,Radnine,2010-07-30 00:45:00,1538," I tried to jump on the Flouro bandwagon, and spooled up all of my spares with it. I use it when it helps to have a line sink and be invisible, but I have a heck of a time with it coming un-spooled and tangling. I have tried taking a wack of it off the spool (in case I put too much on) and still. Also I found that I missed the sensitivity of braid (flouro felt like mono to me). I'd love to love it having spent loads to spool up, but am having trouble warming to it. Help!! Jim"
489762,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-30 01:42:00,0,"Just grabbed my Tracer FireLine, second time buying it too. There was one time i got fire line original from the sporstman show and it was brutal. I could bust it with my hands, it was like it was brital. My conclusion was it was a bad batch, maybe thats what some of you guys could be getting?? . Soon I will try Powerpro red, Im sure all are good......"
489803,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-30 04:16:00,932,"I should clarify something as well - as I'm fishing braid with a fluoro leader 100% of the time, it makes no difference whether it bleeds or not.  And the local store to me sells Power Pro for 15,99, not 19.99."
489808,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-30 04:43:00,0,  What local store is this? Close to NOTL?
487804,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-23 17:01:00,4399,Although I am a die hard fan of plain ole mono CTC has the above mentioned line on sale for 40% off or 14.99 a box I am going too try this braid thing again!!
487806,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-23 17:04:00,2690,"I was an old school monofilament guy as well, until this year...have really been impressed with Power Pro on my Arbor spinning combo, and, Cajun Red on my musky combo.  Haven't tried Fireline."
487808,Fang,2010-07-23 17:04:00,1330,and at last check they might even have some stock in store!!
487811,xkempx,2010-07-23 17:16:00,84,"  Power Pro line is good, i have it on my reel now...BUT i love the fire line. Its a nice light line...."
487814,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-23 17:26:00,0,  What store??
487816,BillM,2010-07-23 17:31:00,17367,"Sweet, I'll take a run over to CTC tonight and see if the Barrie store also has the sale."
487817,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-23 17:35:00,2690,"All stores, guys...it is in the flyer."
487827,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-23 17:58:00,4399,"  This will be my last go at this braid thing a lot of my buddies think I`am a little thick in the head for not liking braid, I won`t argue the thick part.  I think the last problem I had with braid may have been more of a spooling and or set-up problem, we`ll see!"
487830,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-23 18:02:00,2690,"The only complaint I had with braid so far is, when Spincast, Vinnimon and I went out on Lake O...I spooled up my Shimano Corsair with 30 lb braid, the stuff was like a spiny flea magnet!!"
487832,BillM,2010-07-23 18:07:00,17367,  Make sure you put tape on the spool before the braid goes on or else you might encounter slipping issues.
487834,BucktownAngler,2010-07-23 18:13:00,582," i just use a couple feet of mono as a backing so it doesnt slip. No problems for me.  One of my buddies had braid spooled on his reel by BPS and they didnt use a backing, and he had problems with slipping"
487839,BillM,2010-07-23 18:26:00,17367,I use mono on my baitcaster as backing and tape on my spinning reels..  No problems with either.
487863,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-23 20:09:00,0,I have been using dental floss......minty fresh
487957,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-24 02:09:00,947,spend the extra 5 and get a spool of powerpro or spider wire.  you will regret buying fireline it breaks randomly.  I use to be a true believer in Fireline
487964,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-24 02:30:00,0,  Im gonna try spider wire next round. I still like FireLine but change is sometimes good............
487975,GBW,2010-07-24 03:14:00,8460,x2!!!! Spider wire is 100x better then fireline.
487982,BillM,2010-07-24 04:05:00,17367,"The only thing I don't use Fireline on is my muskie gear.  If I'm running braid on a spinning reel it's Fireline Crystal..  Never has an issue with it randomly breaking..  I even spooled my Frogwater centerpin with Fireline!!  Gotta love those 200yrd instant hooksets!!!  All we used down in Florida for shorefishing was 6lb Fireline as well, only thing that ever broke it off was a mackerels teeth    I don't plan on changing anytime soon."
488531,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-26 16:15:00,4399,"Okay I spooled a couple of baitcasters and spinning reels with the braid and I still find the braid does not come off the baitcasters nice and smooth like mono does seems to be more prone to the odd bird`s nest. On the spinning reels I used one for a surface lure and tried a walk the dog and jerk and pause retrieve and the line would not spool on the spool it would spool on the bottom of the spool and not where the line was supposed to go, when I used a steady retrieve this would not happen. The positives were the feel It felt like I could feel every blade of grass my spinnerbait touched and when the pike were hitting the spinnerbaits you could feel really feel the strike,the little snot rockets I was catching felt like ten pounders!LOL  So the jury is still out on this braid thing!"
488534,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 16:21:00,932,"I've fished all three lines that are being mentioned here. Here's how they should be ranked:  (1) Power Pro - The best, period. (2) Spiderwire - A decent choice if for some reason you can't find PP. (3) Fireline - Just not as good as either of the aforementioned.  Buy some power pro, but thanks for letting us know about the sale - braid fisherman pay a lot more for their line (depending how often you re-spool) and any sale is appreciated.  Cheers, Ryan"
488541,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 16:30:00,0," Is power pro braid or mono, never bought it before............PEACE!"
488631,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 20:07:00,932," Power Pro is Braid.  I fish the green stuff, but apparently the red stuff is less visible - I'm not sure I buy it as Power Pro loses its dye in next to no time - don't be alarmed by this if you ever buy it - it's just dye."
488634,TC1OZ,2010-07-26 20:15:00,987, I spooled my bait caster for the first time with 10# power pro and I still haven't gotten all the green stuff off my finger yet.  I also traded a rod for a couple spools of spider wire. 10# & 25# Not sure if this stuff bleeds as much? Haven't touched it yet.
488691,solopaddler,2010-07-27 00:55:00,8605,"Bump up to a heavier braid on your baitcaster. If you're new to braid thicker line will be easier for you to cast. Yes, it may be overrated for your rod, but you shouldn't have any problems if you know how to handle your equipment.  I use 60lb power pro on a med/hvy baitcaster rated for 12-25lb's and have had zero issues.  (Side note, but I like power pro the best as well)"
488721,Radnine,2010-07-27 02:32:00,1538,"  I have never had Fireline break on me, randomly or otherwise and I have four reels spooled up with it. You might be confusing Fireline with Legend boats. (okay, that was strictly for comedic value so don't panic) I just bought two spools from CT on sale. I am just pissed that I missed out on the Eagle colour C350 FF that they had on for less than 1/2 price (each store had one or so). Jim"
488745,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-27 03:36:00,932,I'm not sure if spiderwire bleeds as much either as I always fish the white stuff . . . so I guess it doesn't bleed as much if you fish the white stuff . . .
