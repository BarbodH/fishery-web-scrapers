489218,g_clot,2010-07-28 15:26:00,104,A friend forwarded this to me the other day and thought it was a good way to save bucks on your AA battery consumption.  Less $ on batteries = more $ on fishing       And thanks to Sudzy... it's a hoax.  I'll hang my head in shame now.  Hoax link   Cheers
489232,Sudzy,2010-07-28 16:16:00,88,"haha I wish, Fake though  http://www.snopes.com/photos/humor/batteryhack.asp"
489241,g_clot,2010-07-28 16:23:00,104,    Good find - I never would have checked the validity further.  Thanks for the heads up......  Time to send that new link to everyone I sent the original too.
489251,Syn,2010-07-28 16:39:00,519,Usually I buy these when on sale (free shipping) from Dell. Eneloop rechargeable http://accessories.d...s1&sku=A0958680  Also I heard Duracell white tops from Super store are the same battery or just as good.  I saw these battery coupons at save.ca for the Energizer Lithiums http://save.ca/coupons
489305,Sudzy,2010-07-28 18:57:00,88,"  No problem, myth has been around for a few years, I know a few people who have checked for themselves as well, lol."
489312,Terry,2010-07-28 19:20:00,14456,"I have seen this floating around for a couple of years and always someone would post it's a fake but you know if I ever find an old/dead 6 volt battery, you can bet that I will take it apart, just to see for myself"
489313,Sudzy,2010-07-28 19:25:00,88,"I will save you the trouble, lol  This is what is really on the inside: http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/Stories/006.2/index.html"
489314,GBW,2010-07-28 19:25:00,8460,I will be doing so tomorrow Terry
489326,Terry,2010-07-28 19:52:00,14456,"LOL, let me know whats inside"
489335,GBW,2010-07-28 20:16:00,8460,Will do.  That is if I find time to do between fishing and the kids party...
489346,DanD,2010-07-28 20:36:00,2223,"Hey guys when did 1.5 volts of a AA battery, times 32 batteries add up to 6 volts. The math alone tells you it’s not true; doesn’t it?  Dan."
489381,anonymous,2010-07-28 22:34:00,58,"If you take 4 cells at 1.5v and put them in series for 6v and then take the other 7 groups and put em all in parallel you have 6v and 8x the amps. Your math doesn't work, but real electrical math does.  As a quick follow up, AA cells are generally 1.2 volts as well."
489412,Jer,2010-07-29 00:35:00,1426,"  My math tells me that if 6V lantern battery was that complicated, it would cost alot more than $5."
489418,Fisherman,2010-07-29 00:47:00,7201,"Well, there's two sides to every story and in actual fact, there were larger batteries made that were a mix of AA and C cells.  Anyone that ever did any time in the Service(Army) will remember that when your AM/FM radio or electric shaver died, you would crack open a PRC77 or 524 Radio set battery, there are about 12 C cells and 12 AA cells in it, just wired together, one side for the receiver, the other for the transmitter."
489481,DanD,2010-07-29 10:30:00,2223, Yea you’re right; this poor old bum mechanic was just thinking a strait series circuit; me bad. LOL   Dan.
489709,anonymous,2010-07-29 22:06:00,58," It's all good, interestingly enough I buy 2 of the cheapie 6v batteries from Giant Tiger, duct tape them together, solder a wire between the + & - of the two and then use it for powering the fishfinder when we go away and rent boats, 1-2 pounds sure beats any regular car battery for hauling around."
489872,GBW,2010-07-30 14:02:00,8460,"Terry, the one I opened up here had C size in it BUT each one was 1.5x the normal length.  I could see if you needed 3 C's for a flashlight you could prob. use 2 of these."
489877,Terry,2010-07-30 14:11:00,14456,inquiring minds want to know  thanks for checking... then some makes could use 32 AA sized batteries too
489879,GBW,2010-07-30 14:14:00,8460,some could
489942,Sudzy,2010-07-30 17:20:00,88,lol you guys cant be serious....
