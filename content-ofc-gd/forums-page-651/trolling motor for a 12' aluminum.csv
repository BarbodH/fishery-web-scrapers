489003,codered,2010-07-27 23:50:00,123,Hey  guys I'm looking  to  buy  a  new trolling motor  for some small back lake fishing  in  a  12' aluminum boat. I was thinking something  in the 45# range. I have heard that mincota traxxxis  is the best bang for my  buck. Butt I am a little confused  as  to  a  5  speed  or a varriable speed The way it was discribed to me was a 5 speed is a constant flow of energy . Variable is a pulse  so  it  conserves energy I was told it would save me 40% of my battery. I am  a little confused    the  differance  is  $259 for the 5 speed   or $375 for the Variable... Is it worth  spending the extra  money  on  the higher end modle? or should I  go  a tottaly different  root  and buy a  55 pound enduro??? any  help  would be  great. Im  going to buy one  this weekend  for  a  trip  the  following  week...
489009,scugpg,2010-07-28 00:12:00,1373,Go with the Traxxis. Variable speed also means up to 5x longer on a charge! The Traxxis are much easier to stow/deploy.  On a 12ft I'd go with a 45 or 50lb Traxxis.
489011,codered,2010-07-28 00:21:00,123,what does 5x longer on a charge mean? A battery charging on a charger doesent have anything to do with a  motor? am I missunderstanding something  ... mabey     i am stearing in the wrong direction...
489050,livinisfishin,2010-07-28 01:57:00,661,The motor will last 5 x longer with the variable speed as opposed to the 5 speed. You can stay out a lot longer before you have to charge the battery again.
489052,Fisherman,2010-07-28 01:58:00,7201,"It simply means you will have a much longer period of use of the motor from the battery.  Pulse technology turns the motor ""on and off"" at a very high rate, not perceivable to us, but uses a lot less battery power.  Don't forget to recharge the battery after each day of use, regardless of how little or how long you used it."

489259,KawarthaGuy,2010-07-28 17:00:00,46,I have the Traxxis on my 12 ft and it does the job nicely.  The Minn Kota battery box is also good with its quick connect terminals and easy carry handles.  Kawartha Guy  
489370,Greg14,2010-07-28 21:59:00,12,I have a Minkota...33lb thrust the variable modle only used about 3 times..used  on a 12 ft tinny worked great..dont need it any more as I have a larger boat now..id like $175 for it if your interested..I paid near 300$ when I bought it...im near Brantford...St George area 519-448-3094
489487,Chris,2010-07-29 11:14:00,405,"I wouldn't worry too much about the charge lasting 5 times longer. I used to have a 14 foot/20hp tiller with a 28lb. thrust MinnKota. I could use the trolling motor all day long on a single charge. Seeing as you should charge the battery after each use anyway, having a charge left over from the first day of fishing becomes a useless point. Also many may suggest going as big as you can. The argument is that sometimes you may get caught in 4 foot waves and it's nice to have extra power, however, if you get caught in 4 foot waves with a 12' foot boat, you have bigger issues than how much thrust your trolling motor may have. There's no substitue for paying attention to the weather reports before heading out on the water.  I'd be taking up that offer on the 33lb. thrust offered by Greg14."
