489245,Chris 362,2010-07-28 16:32:00,14,"Hey Guys,  Looking to try my hand at night fishing in this area, not targeting anything in general just looking to have fun. Tried with worms once and not even a nibble.......Any advice on baits or techniques?. Was thinking of trying with minnows.....  Thanks."
489260,bdox,2010-07-28 17:01:00,329, Another couple weeks and chucking spoons off the pier will probably start producing
489300,Mike Pike,2010-07-28 18:44:00,1332,"Yup, as bdox says; in another few weeks, salmon will begin staging in the area.  Followed by Rainbows and Browns after that.  Spoons are the weapons of choice.  If you're interested in night fishing, that's the most productive time to be out casting.  Goodluck!"
489304,Sudzy,2010-07-28 18:53:00,88,I have heard of people all ready getting fish with spoons off the pier.
489332,uglyfish,2010-07-28 20:00:00,981,i think its gonna be more then a few weeks before we start to see any salmon there. water temps are gonna have to come down quite a bit first before they start to stage and run
489394,Chris 362,2010-07-28 23:05:00,14,Yea I've been tossing cleos lately but still nothing...... Guess I'm gonna have to wait
489425,bucktail,2010-07-29 01:03:00,1857,"Try deep diving cranks along the walls for sheephead right now, hey they fight good abd are usually there at this time."
489441,bigjimmcbob,2010-07-29 01:51:00,17," Coming in a few weeks back someone pulled a brown trout (or what looked to be) at the end of the launch.  As a teenager I caught browns starting in mid Aug am and late pm from the ship canal pier. As well as breakwalls along the hamilton/stoney creek shore.  That pier use to be pretty busy in the spring and fall for salmon/bows, wonder what its like now.  I use to fish it up until Dec.  I use to hang row bags straight down off the end of the pier for Lakers in Nov/Dec.  Not sure how much as changed in 15-20 years but it should be the same."
489491,Gerritt,2010-07-29 11:47:00,6129,The pier is closed due to construction.  G
