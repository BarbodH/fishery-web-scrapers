91360,nautifish,2007-07-06 18:17:00,1416,Well myself and mr sinns decided to head out for a few hrs and fish yesterday evening at a local spot here in town & a beautiful one it was. The bite was on in total i caught 14 scrappie and mr sinns landed 4 SM AND 2 LM PLUS a pumpkinseed and also eight scrappies. Shame there was not too much size to most we catched . This is the biggest scrappie caught of the evening.    Here is just one of the smallies that mr sinns landed.    Here is one of the two LM he landed around a pound and a half.   It was a beautiful eveing as the sunset        Also took this shot of two guys out fishing in a canoe on the lake with the mist sitting over top of the water. Would have loved for this picture to be a bit clearer i really got to invest in an extra zoom attachment for my cam.   So in all a fun evening of fishing just wish the d**n mozzys came out in the winter and not through the summer. They were so thick last night they could have carried you away.....lol

91371,Jen,2007-07-06 18:57:00,833,Glad to see you got out Tracy!  What a beautiful Sunset and fish too...  Is it not wonderful living in paradise??  Great Report  Cheers  Jen
91380,nautifish,2007-07-06 19:10:00,1416,  Is it not wonderful living in paradise??  Ya know jen i do not think there is anywhere else i would want to live. Having travelled most of Europe nothing seems to compare to port dover. Don't get me wrong some very beautiful and breath taking places in Europe. But to have a fresh water lake with such vantastic fishing a great beach good bars and resturaunts spectacular sunsets and all right on my very own door step its hard not to love this little town.

91383,nautifish,2007-07-06 19:19:00,1416,  Could not agree with you more.  .....& i like the last pic also just a little niffed it is not a very clear image.  Would have made a great photo framed and put up on the wall in my den.
91389,nautifish,2007-07-06 19:29:00,1416,Okay hopefully these ones are a little clearer.
