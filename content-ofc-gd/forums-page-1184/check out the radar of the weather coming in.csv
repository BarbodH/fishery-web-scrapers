91765,nautifish,2007-07-08 15:13:00,1416,Yeah i know LBH.  We have the annual pissup pottahawk going on today. At 7.00am this morning i headed down to a local favorite spot to catch some minnows......was beautiful blue sky sun shining  lots of boats crossing the lake heading to the island.........Actually i say catch minnows i ended up also spending about an hr catching snakes...LOL....Felt like the crocodile hunter....lol...Mr sinns was too scared to grab em so of course i had to!.....lol....I just wish i had taken my camera with me this morning i could have got some hillarious video footage of mr sinns scared of the snakes.....LOL........I got nailed by one but diden't hurt.....  Anyway back on topic...SORRY ABOUT THAT lol  My plan was to head out on  the boat this morning but the wind has picked up it is now raining and the lake was white capping pretty good. I would bet a hundred bucks the life guard here in dover are going to be maxed out today because of idiots going across to the island in way to small a boats. Happens every yr. On my way back into dover this morning saw one boat going out probably a 18 ftr had to be 12 people or more on that boat!......Crazy just crazy!
