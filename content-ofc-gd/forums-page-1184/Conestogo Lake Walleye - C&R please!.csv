I wasn't sure I should bring attention to this, but in light that they have discontinued stocking, I felt it was important to let it be known that it is very important to release any walleye being caught here so the fishery has a chance to grow.  http://www.grandriver.ca/parks/conestogo_tab_2007.pdf   "" Due to the spread of the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) disease in the Great Lakes, this stocking program has been cancelled. The MNR is trying to contain the disease to only the Great Lakes regions by stopping the export of bait fish from this region. So now more than ever, Catch and Release is imperative to the continued success of the walleye fishery in Conestogo Lake.""  ""Special Note If you are fortunate to catch a walleye please release your catch and report this to a staff member. Your cooperation in this is greatly appreciated and may well assist the walleye in increasing their numbers. Just think a walleye lake in your backyard."""
