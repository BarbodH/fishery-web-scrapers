91620,Terry,2007-07-07 23:16:00,14456,"I didn't know it was on tonight so I predict, I am going to watch it...thanks"
91621,addict,2007-07-07 23:21:00,475,i hope tito gets his big mouth broke
91630,Crazyhook,2007-07-07 23:43:00,1154,Tito Silva Sherk! Nog
91632,Corey,2007-07-07 23:47:00,355,"What crazyhook predicted, exactly."
91636,danc,2007-07-07 23:52:00,4677,I predict that I'll be watching the NASCAR Pepsi 400 at Daytona under the lights. YEE HAW!!!
91647,Crazyhook,2007-07-08 00:30:00,1154,LOL @ doubting the muscle shark 
91649,Crazyhook,2007-07-08 00:41:00,1154,anyone wants results click here for the play by play'  http://www.thefightnetwork.com/news_detail.php?nid=4248
91651,derekadam,2007-07-08 00:42:00,22,"The shark is an animal!! I'll go Evans, Silva, Sherk, Herring...with a card like the one tonite I don't mind paying $39.99"
91652,charlesn,2007-07-08 00:44:00,551,I predict 2 upsets just because this is the year of the upset: Evans and Nate And 2 favorites: Sherk and Big Nog.  I hope I'm wrong though as I'd love to see Rampage and Tito fight and a Silva Franklin rematch...  Charles
91653,Crazyhook,2007-07-08 00:46:00,1154,I just hope the Silva vs Nate fight is good. Nate has been in some real snoozers
91656,charlesn,2007-07-08 01:01:00,551,I don't think Silva knows how to be in a boring fight.  He didn't let Lutter lay and pray and he knows he's in against a better fighter...  I just keep remembering him getting caught by a Ryo Chonan flying heel hook and I wonder when his next lapse will be.  Silva has all the tools to be dominant for a while though.  Charles
91658,glirw,2007-07-08 01:06:00,200,Tito's experience in the cage is gonna do it for him tonight . Tito by 3rd round TKO .  I see Silva losing his title tonight to a better wrestler via leg lock or decision .  Sean Sherk by Decision against an always game Franca .  Noguiera by anything he wants !
91814,xrap,2007-07-08 19:30:00,683,"I didn't get to watch it, anyone know what the results were?"
91824,Corey,2007-07-08 20:18:00,355,Tito & Nate was a draw Sherk won Silva won Nog won
91837,xrap,2007-07-08 21:10:00,683,Thanks corey
