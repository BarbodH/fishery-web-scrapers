91057,Shaun Rickard,2007-07-05 17:04:00,144,"My mate Mike and I got out over the weekend and finally found some fish. The fishing is still a little sketchy out this way right now but if you stick at it and cover water you'll very likely hook up.  Saturday we hooked 6 fish and boated 5, Sunday we hooked 10 and boated 6 and Monday we hooked 6 and boated 4. The largest fish all weekend weighed in at just over 20lbs (Pictures of a couple of our fish below).  I have just started playing around with the mooching rods and reels. What a blast it is fighting fish on these set ups, I am actually convinced that with the longer rods and 1 to 1 ratio on the reels that you lose less fish, which is good for me  The fish seem to be scattered right now, we found water temps of between 41F to 42F were most productive. These we found down 50ft over 200ft to 250ft of water. A temp sensor can really help this time of year to help locate those cooler pockets of water.  Baits of choice this weekend were cut bait fished behind the new Smart Fish Flashers and silver flies fish behind Smart Fish. Smart Fish have an amazing roll action, and by far the best feature is that unlike the Spin Doctors they have an adjustable fin (Picture below). The adjustable fin allows you to tighten or widen the roll of the flasher to suit your fishing conditions  We found the ideal trolling speeds this weekend were between 2.3 to 2.7 mph on the GPS. Don't be surprised if you pick up a few Rainbows when fishing these depths, we even managed a couple of nice Coho over the course of the weekend  The Kings should start moving in thicker soon, the winds have stabalized somewhat along with the air temps. I'm looking forward to a great summer on the big pond and hope to see some of you out there.  Good luck to everyone this weekend for the start of the Salmon Derby  Cheers, Shaun            "
91058,Joey,2007-07-05 17:09:00,9122,Great report Shaun.  Thanks for the tips and the info on the smart fish.  I might have to get me a few of those.  Joey
91059,Stoty,2007-07-05 17:10:00,2910,"Nice fish!  If your ever looking for someone to go out with in Pickering, PM me and I will give you my number!"
91060,ccmtcanada,2007-07-05 17:17:00,7971,Nice catch and SWEEET pictures!  Lots of great info in your post too.  The only issue for me is that finding 200 to 250 feet of water is hard fishing from shore....LOL.  Great job and report!
91082,SlowPoke,2007-07-05 18:09:00,2984,"Great report Shaun and I especially like that first picture! Cliff, you leave those offshore fish alone... you can't have 'em all! -Brian"
91092,ccmtcanada,2007-07-05 18:25:00,7971, Brian...I saw this radio controlled Boat that someone is marketing on the internet...designed to take your lure out a ridiculous distance.  You push a button on the remote and it drops your lure.  Only problem is that I need to find a reel that can hold 3 miles of line and I need 5 sets of arms to reel the sucker in once I had a fish on....haha.
