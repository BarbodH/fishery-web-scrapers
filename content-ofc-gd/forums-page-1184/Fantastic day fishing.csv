91548,knightfisher,2007-07-07 17:48:00,237,"Hi all. I don't post here much, but this one's a must. Enjoy    Valerie and I hooked up with Bowen Friday morning and experienced fishing on Lake O.  The Captain   We had no expectations at all. Just wanted to be out on the lake and perhaps catch a few. Bowen ensured we got into a few, and a few we did.  Here's Valerie reeling in the line. She found out quick, there's a little more line out on the lake compared to shore fishing and the rod and fish just a touch heavier.   This is the first salmon she has ever caught.   Bowen put us on to some fish, and it continued.   This ugly thing was a first for us to see.   Here is another fish caught that was one of the victims of the lamprey   We caught a few shakers (small salmons)   This lamprey was just scarey, even Captain Bowen was backing away at first    You never know what your going to catch when fishing... a sheephead   there's more"
91550,knightfisher,2007-07-07 17:50:00,237,"Here's another one I believe Valerie brought in.   This fish was not willing to come in, so Bowen and I chatted for a while until the fish stopped taking line out. What a blast.   The wait is over, also time seems to vanish while fishing, I don't know how long it took to get this one in, but it's a nice one.   With two cameras we took about 60 pics and to be honest I don't recall the order the fish were caught. Here's Valerie with another one.   Valerie had two really long runs today. One was at least or seemed like fifteen minutes. She was getting tired to say the least but wouldn't pass over the rod. She lost one that Bowen figures was at least 25 or more pounds.   Bowen had no desire to bring in any fish. He wanted us to enjoy the thrill. He did however bring in a few shakers quickly, to get the line back out. But he was willing to have his picture taken with one.  I was totally impressed by Bowen's skill, and professionalism. Once he decide the spot we were to fish, he had the lines in the water, and was just a blurr of activity to watch. Once he got us into some fish, he said who wants it, and many times unless it was some of the larger fish we had no idea any fish were on. He netted  most of the fish, and and the same time would be directing me or Valerie which way to steer the boat, or speed, whatever. When there were lulls in the fishing, he would be adjusting the depth of the lines, and putting on different lures.... Words cannot describe how well this young man knows his business and gets his products. He has mentioned to me a few times he wants to be a charter fishing Captain. Well at age 16 in my books he's there. And in a few years when he decides to make it a reality, he will do great. Words cannot describe how impressed I am with Bowen.     We figure we caught over 15, but under 20 fish. And we weighed one that was about 18lb. Many were close to that size with some smaller and also, a few shakers as mentioned.   This next and last fish caught as we were heading was caught by Valerie and again was her first and personal best. A nice bow.   A few fish were brought home and Bowen continued to show his skill and cleaned three fish in not time flat. We have never had lake salmon before so this will be a treat.   Two final pictures were taken, one is shown below.  I won't show the last one, as Bowen mouth dropped in shock and he turned many shades of red. Valerie decided to give Bowen a peck on the cheek in apreciation for the wonderful time out. Bowen must of been in shock because not only did he take us out fishing, he bought us lunch afterwards. Bowen words can't describe the pleasure and thrill you bestowed on us, especially Valerie. Thank you is not enough, but is all we can offer.  Thankyou Bowen Valerie and Daniel"
