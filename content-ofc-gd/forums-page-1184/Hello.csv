Being from the US, I'm able to spend a few weeks each year up North and just love it.    When you get some time, post some pics of where you are.  I'm sure we'd all love to see some adventures from the other side of the 'big pond'.   Again ... welcome aboard my friend."

91822,waterboy,2007-07-08 20:15:00,17,Welcome to the board English.  England is a great place.  I spent two years there back in the mid-90's and my first child was born in Reading.  What and where do you fish mostly?
91828,English,2007-07-08 20:24:00,90,"Thanks guys, I am from Manchester by birth, and now live in Licolnshire thats the East coast of England half way up.  I fish only occasionally now, got 2 lovely children aged 4 and 8, and a wife which keep me very busy add to that I am a plumber / heating engineer usually a good living to be had but we relocated from Surrey near London 4 years ago and it has taken me nearly all this time to get enough customers so that I can start to live again. Must remember to do a bit more research if I do that again  I have fished for all sorts but my favourite is carp, I am not one of the mad english anglers any more, I used to think nothing of sitting behind my rods for a week without a run but not any more I like to try and make things happen and go and look for the fish.  I have fished a fair bit in France and Spain for carp and catfish, I have caught hundreds of carp in the low to mid 20lb mark but never broke 25lb quite surprising considering the guys that I used to fish with had all had many 40lb and one guy two at 54 and 55 lb, just seemed like it was never to be for me, however when we last went to Spain to fish on the Ebro I caught a 66lb cat   and no one else caught much at all the river was in flood and the mountain snow was making it very cold, guess we picked the wrong time of year.  If I get a chance I will post up a few pics of our catch, there is usually a good bit of larking about and a fair bit of beer involved but thats what us limeys are supposed to be famous for  Cheers all tight lines"
