Tons of bites and fish, here are a couple of the larger ones, did not get into any real monster bass but we were also only out for a couple of hours.  Looking forward to giving them a longer test.  However the reason I only went out for a couple of hours was that I wanted to take my girls fishing from shore. I had an even better time watching the 2 and 4 year old catching sunfish.  Who would have thought a small hook and some corn would generate so much fun.  The little one actually hooked a fish, snagged some weeds. gave it a hard yank and the fish landed right in her lap.  I was waiting for the tears but instead she just started laughing and yelling ""fishy on my leg""  priceless.  Hope everyone had a great weekend fishing.    couple of bass after using senko lure for the first time     The girls fishing     "

When I take my 5 year old, I spend the whole time with her...she manages to catch fish every time I put my line in the water.  LOL.  The fish in the lap thing was hilarious....I know what you mean....the tense first few seconds...what will she do?  Is the day over??? haha.  The kids looked like they had a great time and that alone makes it worth it.  At least you got into some bass!"
