91479,Weeds,2007-07-07 02:45:00,782,"Definately my favourite spinnerbait and possibly my favourite lure. They cast incredibly well, resist snagging really well also, the single blade model throws off some huge vibrations even at a slow speed and compared to some other lures they aren't even that pricey. I love spinnerbaits, must be one of the easiest lures to unhook from a fish too which is a big plus in my books."

91494,mepps,2007-07-07 03:31:00,1301,"I like them, they look good, they cast great, they move through the water nicely - but the ones I ahve baught have not been the best quality. I cant remember if I ahve ever caugth a fish on one, but I have seen Bill catch plenty of muskies with them!"
91503,motv8tr,2007-07-07 07:05:00,2587,Never tried them....might have to pick one up now  Maureen
91512,Rich Clemens,2007-07-07 10:08:00,3131,"I started using them last year and really like them.  Most of the pike that I caught at Lakair this year, while casting, was on the slopmaster.  Tuesday of that week, I pulled 4 pike from the weedbed just off the dock in about an hour.  I have 3 of the char/char, but may look at picking up a few other color combos for next year."
91513,thecraftyprince,2007-07-07 10:55:00,37,"It's hard to argue with success, besides, it's Squid's goto bait ! lol  I threw one for the first time this year and it produced 4 ofah quality bass (3-4lbs) and a 44"" ski, I'm sold. While there have been quality issues in the past they're relatively cheap, $11-12 at Lebaron's, single colorado blade. If you can Dawg get a hold of a tandem blade model in either firetiger or bullfrog."
91515,Roy,2007-07-07 11:39:00,13728,I should have a look at them but the best quality ones I've seen so far are the Ospreys and Jef's baits.....beautiful work on both baits.
91517,Crazyhook,2007-07-07 12:11:00,1154,"still have one I have to give to Muskystudd for free  you guys enjoy em, not my favorite bait at all..."
91521,Rich Clemens,2007-07-07 12:41:00,3131,If they ever make a red one Glen ... you're screwed.

91557,jediangler,2007-07-07 18:16:00,1923,"Just bought a black and orange one from Fishing Fanatics in Waterloo for $14.99. Last one I bought was $19.99 from Natural Sports in Kitchener. Haven't used them much yet, but I will."

91571,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-07 19:36:00,1351,"i heard great things about them.. finally got one this year.. threw it out a couple times, got nothing.. same colour as glen's but single colorado blade.. i want to pick up a tandem one also..."
91586,fishinfool,2007-07-07 20:27:00,366, $14.99 for one!!! You gotta be kiddin right!! Are they titanium with gold leaf inlay?
91627,addict,2007-07-07 23:36:00,475,looks like a nice spinner never tried them personally.spinners are my favorite lure nothing beats the feel of a strike on one.simple and effective also one of the most weedless lures going.15 bucks for one is pretty tight i wince when i pay 10 for a strike king elite but i love those elite spinners.i was at a small tackle shop in lindsay ontario where they were selling homemade spinners similar to the strike king elite very nice bait picked up three for 10 bucks.
91644,ChrisK,2007-07-08 00:13:00,2772,"Glen, They are one sweet looking bait !!!!!"
91847,Muskieman,2007-07-08 22:29:00,2472,"The bait seems to run true a little longer , now i don't want to bash the company but Black Bly make a great spinnerbait too, and it's half the price with a just as wide selection of colors . never had a problem with either, and to me are a comparable product . I buy both regularly, but I especially like the tornado firetiger in the fall for muskie. if only it would come in a 1 1/2 oz."
