I have been told it is under $200 PER YEAR for motorbike with 49cc or under.  How about 125cc engine? insurance cost, anyone have any experience?  Is this true?  How much are you paying for yours?  Which manufacturer / model do you have ?   I was thinking of one of those Yamaha scooters."

You're best bet is to call an insurance company...the cost will vary depending on your experience, frequency of use, location etc....won't cost you anything to call an insurance company.  Oh, and what Danbo said  Maureen"
