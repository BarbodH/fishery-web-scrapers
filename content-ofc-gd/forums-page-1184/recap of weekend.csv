We wanted to try some new spots so Friday we tried Christie Conservation area with very little luck. The 9 trout ponds were pretty thick with growth so we tried the lake. We only managed to catch 4 small catfish. This was one of the four. Come Sunday we got up at 5 as I wanted to check Bronte out. We arrived at around six and he fished the harbour and off the pier for a bit as I watched all the boats go out and could only dream. Someday I will get out on a boat. H e again had no luck so I decided to let him cheat and took him to a trout farm. Well, thirty odd dollars later he caught 3 nice sice bows and had a huge smile.well worth it. He wanted to eat his catch for supper so we did and I was surprised that they did not taste too bad for farm fish. He was surprised at the fight and I told him to wait for the steelhead in the fall. All in all not a bad weekend and just getting him out was great. Oh yeah, as far as dad goes I managed to somehow only catch a sucker at the trout farm. Oh, well"

If it was closer to me I'd be trying it out for sure!  Trout farms aren't cheating...I've been wanting to try one out with my little one, but haven't done so yet.  Sounded like a nice fishing weekend!!"
92025,TJQ,2007-07-09 14:25:00,7806,WOW!!!  4 bugle-nosed trout in the same day... id call that s success!!   hey any day fishing is a good day fishing!!
92097,fatherof3,2007-07-09 17:09:00,1769,"lol ,bugle nosed trout sounds so much better! And yes any day fishing is a good day not to mention seeing his smile after schooling me at the trout farm makes it worthwile."
92101,ricoboxing,2007-07-09 17:18:00,398,trout ponds are great for kids. one of my first fishing experiences was at a trout pond and i still remember it to this day. when i little guy gets bigger I'll probably take him there too.
