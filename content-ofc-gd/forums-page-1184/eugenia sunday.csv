Glad to hear the bearing was ok, I have had too many bad memories with bearings going on me. Now I change them every 3 or 4 years no matter what. Those weeds are very strong and just wrap around your motor, I have had to cut them off with a knife had about 20lbs wrapped around the prop."
91990,robinwood,2007-07-09 12:48:00,28,"pulled out from boat launch and generally headed toward the island - lots of weed beds everywhere, I noticed a lot of boats and people hanging around the dam - but it looked crowded, we did seea lot of tiny perch following lures etc - and  acouple of people pulled out what must have been 1-2 lb LM a little further out from the island we circled around and found the area with the stumps etc - and basically tried some sureface , lures and senko type worms etc in among the weeds -  people were leaving as we arrived - some had caught 4-5 fish (claimed) - but we did start late- despite a bit of rain - the day was nice and the boss will try again!!  oh by the way, how did you do in Simcoe?"
92001,Jay T,2007-07-09 13:22:00,282,"I didn't make it to Simcoe, the guy I was going with eneded up taking the bottom of his motor off in Wasaga so it will take 2-3 days to get the parts needed to put it back together. I ended up hitting the rivers near by Eugenia and got into 6""-14"" speckles. Lost a good 16"" speckle as I was just bending down to get it. I had a blast I haven't fished small rivers in a long time. I ended catching 8 trout in all in about an hour and lost 8, all were put back to fight another day. Love the colors on those little speckles."
