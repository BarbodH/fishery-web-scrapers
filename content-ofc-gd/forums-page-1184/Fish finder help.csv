Must be portible, must be able to mount with no screws, must have a its own power source and most important must be tard proof. Peace Ken (l still beleave that rebooting is kicking it again)"
92063,Stoty,2007-07-09 15:27:00,2910,"Pretty much all of the portable fish finders on the market have everything that your looking for. I have had a portable eagle fish finder for years now, and it has worked great. I would recommend Eagle for just a standard fish finder.  If you want to get something a little on the higher end, I just picked up a Lowrance 522 iGPS unit. These are also fantastic! Has the fishfinder as well as a GPS system in it. I am sure they have a portable GPS/sonar unit as well.  Hope this helps!"

92069,bbog,2007-07-09 15:43:00,665,"Hi bowshep,  I also fish/troll from a canoe and use the Eagle Fishmark 320P (around $300 in portable version). Self contained portable that works great for me. I guess if you are intending on adding a trolling motor you could select from a larger variety of FF running off the trolling battery.  Personally I have enough to transport without adding a trolling motor and battery.  Enjoy your new rig."
