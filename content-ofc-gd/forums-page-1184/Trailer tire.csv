91887,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-09 01:04:00,1351,"smart thing to always check.. i never really looked at the tires that much.. i just check the air in them everytime, i guess i'll spot it while i check the air though. however i do check the lights every single time, before and returning fromt he trip."
91906,DanTheMan,2007-07-09 02:09:00,257,"Wow, Thats wild!!  Why does that happen?"
91952,Rich Clemens,2007-07-09 10:17:00,3131,Very good reminder for all of us.  I too check over the tires and make sure the tire pressures are corret before heading out.  That includes the boat trailer and the towing vehicle.

92087,Whopper,2007-07-09 16:41:00,2174, Broken belt Dan  I've had way to many Carlisle's look like that on my boat trailers to ever use another.  Whopper
