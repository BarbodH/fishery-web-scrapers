91531,mikec,2007-07-07 14:54:00,26,"hey guys,   Im planning on going camping with my family in the next couple weeks, but I want to find a spot not too far that has good fishing but is also good for little kids (4-12 years old). I was thinking somewhere on Cook's Bay or Lake Simcoe, but I dont know how the fishing is there. Any other reccomendations? I am looking for a place good for kids within 2 hours of me (I am located an hour directly north of Toronto), with good pike or bass (or walleye and muskie too!) fishing. Please let me know your thoughts.   Thanks,   Mike   PS - spots with trout would be better, but i know lakes with brookies or bows are too far north, but maybe someone knows a spot   Message was edited by:  impossible"
91532,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-07 15:00:00,2585,if your an hour north of toronto then your in the heart of camping and fishing country.  Try killbear park on georgian bay.  great fishing and good camp sites.  Or try massasagua pp on the moon river.  another great area with great fishing.  Cheers!

91564,CLofchik,2007-07-07 19:01:00,854,"Serpent's Point PP on Rice Lake.  Great bass fishing during the day, good pickeral fishing after dark."
91572,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-07 19:41:00,1351,i second emily pp.. but quite a bit of weeds... just right at the bridge at emily you can catch some decent bass there.
91689,kennyman,2007-07-08 03:52:00,737,It's a little farther but Murphy's Point Provincial Park. Great fishing no matter what you're looking for. My kids caught about fourty panfish each in a couple days there.
91774,Spiel,2007-07-08 15:40:00,9065,....Layzee Acres has everything you're looking for. I've been taking my kids there for years. The lake has bass and pike as well as some walleye and possibly still a few remnant musky. There's a playground for the kids as well as a sandy beach. Fishing off the docks usually provides hours of entertainment for the kids with plenty of panfish.
