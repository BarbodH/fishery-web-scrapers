91841,danbouck,2007-07-08 21:36:00,4380,Didn't see the trailer but Transformers was amazing!
91845,Dutch,2007-07-08 21:56:00,831,"Saw the preview - piqued my interest, that's for sure.  Loved Transformers - great effects, best I have ever seen!  I suspect a remake of Godzilla....but who knows for sure."
91861,Baptiste,2007-07-08 23:55:00,37,"I took the fellas to Transformers at the drive-in last night. I apparently missed an integral plot twist while in the popcorn line up. My boys think it would be a waste of time for anybody else to apply for Oscar consideration since Transformers ""TOTALLY ROCKS"". There were some special effects which are not in the original Fellini version...Two thumbs up from Nathan and Evan."

91923,Hooked,2007-07-09 03:15:00,891,"A good friend of mine was lucky enough to see it a week before it was released in Manhatten with a bunch of Hasbro guys.  Heard it was AWESOME.  I'll have to ask him about that trailer you mentioned though, he's up to speed on all that stuff."
