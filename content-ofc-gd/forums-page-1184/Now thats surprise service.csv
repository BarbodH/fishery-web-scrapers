To my surprise it,s our very own Cisco on the other end.Seems he decided to take the long way to Burliegh falls from TO.LOL  He had brought up my newly aquired gps Garmin 76 S and I must say,what a sweet piece of machinery it is (the gps,not Cisco LOL).It,s got every lake that Im going to need and beyond. Even has some PC hotspots,not that I will need them,but ya just never know.  We had a nice visit and it sure was nice to see ya again Chris.  Thanks again."
