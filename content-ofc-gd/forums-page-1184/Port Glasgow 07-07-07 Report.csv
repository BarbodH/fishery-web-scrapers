Weird day... no bait to be found, ran into lots of floating weeds, down temps fluctuating constently and every fish came off a different lure. We don't need no stinking patterns! Started off with Harold shaking a bow off the hook. I brought in a wally and had it sitting in the motor well when it spit the hook. When I reached for it, it winked at me and jumped back in the water. Got a bow on the leadcore, small but acrobatic with 5 colours out. It's reasting peacfully in my neighbours frezzer right now. Harold lost a wally, landed a nice one and then another little fella. Met a guy on shore who's wife caught a muskie on a spoon. One of these days I'll have an outting that lives up to the ""got my limit in two hours"" rumor. We were on the water for about 4 1/2 hours. Harold with a nice wally...  -Brian"
91703,Greencoachdog,2007-07-08 11:34:00,8163,That's a real nice Wall-ice Brian! On days like that I like to change lures every time I catch a fish.  Great report and pic!!!
91718,ccmtcanada,2007-07-08 12:21:00,7971,"Wow..that sure is a NIIIIICE walleye!  Glad to see you got out on the water...I kept reading and waiting for the ""and then this huge rock came out of the sky and put a hole in my boat""....LOL."
91767,Bly,2007-07-08 15:24:00,1556," I knew it could be done...red devil by any chance??  That is a very nice walleye! Hoping that the only trouble you had on this trip was not being able to get more pictures  ""Got my limit in 2 hours""..I did that once....of course the limit was 2  Thanks for sharing!!!"
91772,SlowPoke,2007-07-08 15:33:00,2984,Sorry bly... they were on the water when she caught it and it was a it wasn't a red devil. -Brian
91778,Bly,2007-07-08 15:53:00,1556,  Awww shucks!  Thanks anyway
91810,icefisherman,2007-07-08 18:58:00,952,"Hmmm Brian...nice report, good pictures and yes, seems similar strange temperature fluctuations as Lake O. today resulting in fishin being all over the map. Will be intersting to read some more reports tonight from both Lake O. and Erie and see what some of the Pro's have observed today on the water. It was just one of those days....right time and right place = full limit Or miss the above two and go home skunked or nearly skunked.... And it is July, mind you....surface temperatures should have been wayyyyy higher in Lake O. then 47.... They were in that range I remember in late March on the south side. Not much progress since then I'd say... Maybe they'll get into 60-70 by January next year  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
