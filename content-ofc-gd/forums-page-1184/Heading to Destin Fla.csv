92128,oxcowboy,2007-07-09 17:51:00,544,"never fished in destin, but have had a lot of luck night fishing off of beaches using calamari and 1ounce weights fishing the bottom.  usually catch some sharks and such.  its also a great way to meet people when you reel that shark in where they have been swimming all day.  hope ya have a good time.  jason"
