91895,kemper,2007-07-09 01:25:00,2232,"Headed out at 4 AM this morning to a buddys cottage for a day of fishing. Location was stony lake, where I had never fished before. We were half awake and on the water at 5 to 6 in the AM  The action started with largemouth and never stopped, we were on the fish all day with most around 14"" and 5 or 6 coming in over the 16"" mark. In total we boated around 40 bass, mostly largemouth with the exception of two smallies and the surprise of my life. I was shooting for the grand slam but lost a walleye at the boat.  Fishin largies in shallow water with a green/white spinner bait i nearly had my arms pulled out of the socket on the second turn of the crank by a nice stony lake musky. I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be a musky fisherman so this was quite the experiance for me. After a great battle (short and sweet, even though im a bass fisherman i use 65 pound PP) we had this 36 inch musky in the boat. Fish was very chunky for its size, and really healthy.  Kinda cool for a bass guy like me, heres some picture from the day, most didnt turn out because all i had was my camera phone.     "

91921,007,2007-07-09 03:03:00,537,Sounds like a fantastic day - congrats on the musky!
91953,motv8tr,2007-07-09 10:22:00,2587,Very nice!!! I know a couple of Bass men that complain about those pesky Musky taking their lures  Maureen
91955,misfish,2007-07-09 10:25:00,29133,That must of been a real nice bonus for the day.
91993,ccmtcanada,2007-07-09 13:02:00,7971,Great surprise Kemper!  Bly and I were out with Fishnsled on that same lake on Saturday.  Funny thing though...we were targetting muskie and only got bass....LOL.  Great pic...the smile says it all.
92080,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-07-09 16:01:00,34,Great report. Congrats on the success.  Who needs sleep when your reel is keeping you up by going zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......zzzzzzzzzzzz....
92081,Hookset,2007-07-09 16:06:00,367,"Congrats Kemper,  That's what fishin' is all about   Hookset."
92083,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-09 16:16:00,0,Congrats on the first Musky. Sounds like you had a blast.
92104,Randy,2007-07-09 17:27:00,115,"Hey Brady, lots of them in Buckhorn.  Better keep your 65 lb PP handy."
92112,addict,2007-07-09 17:35:00,475,"nice toothy critter,wtg on the fish man."
92133,k-max,2007-07-09 17:54:00,20,"you didn't have a leader on did you?  I always wondered how braids stand up to muskie/pike teeth...  perhaps since it was 65lb it's a bit harder to cut through? opinions?  I use 14lb fireline for bass bass fishing and whenever I get to co-incidental pike, more than half of them cut me off..."
92148,mattyk,2007-07-09 18:26:00,2110,"very nice, thanks for sharing. Always nice to get a surprise."
92175,kemper,2007-07-09 20:14:00,2232,"  I was actually worried about that because all that was stickin out of the fish's mouth was one blade on my spinnerbait. Line was fine, but like I said it was a quick fight because i wanted to get him in and then back in the water as quick as I could."
92181,bigbuck,2007-07-09 20:27:00,2449,"If you're targeting toothy critters, USE A LEADER. They can saw their way through mono like butter and can hack their way through braid although it's a lot tougher. Mind you, for bass, 65lb PP is plenty and should take a heck of a lot of abuse before having to retie. Congrats on the surprise."
92182,setomonkey,2007-07-09 20:33:00,872,"Congrats on the fun day of fishing, and the surprise catch.  Mike"
92248,tbayboy,2007-07-10 00:49:00,1497,"Congrats on the great day.  Stoney sure seems like a fun lake, always something different."
