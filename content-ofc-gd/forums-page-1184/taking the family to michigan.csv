Other than that, anyone know anywhere else I could go? We'll probably spend a night in Saginaw, and another closer to Dundee (possibly Ann Arbor). Is there anywhere else you guys can recommend?"

You can also stop at Bronner's (The world's largest Christmas Store). Just outside of Frankenmuth is Birchrun (Off of I-75) they have an outlet mall there but not much savings like there used to be. While in Birchrun you can have lunch or breakfast at Toni's. One order can feed several people. There is a place in Frankenmuth that has an indoor water slide/park but can't remember the name.  I personally think the BPS in Alburn Hills, MI sux. But still nice to visit. Cabela's is much better but located in the middle of nowhere."
