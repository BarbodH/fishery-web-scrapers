91661,brandon,2007-07-08 01:20:00,857,"I moved to Orillia at the end of april to work for a wildlife and pest control company.  I found out when I got here that the job was only seasonal and I would be layed off from November until April.  I was also told full time and I've worked 40 hours one week in this time.  Thursday morning I sent off a resume to a wildlife and pest control company in Vancouver, BC and I found out today that I got the job!! I fly out next monday and start work on tuesday.  This job is giving me year round work, full time hours, benefits, company truck and gas card, option for O/T work, bonuses, commission, and better pay.....how can I say no?  Anyways I just felt like sharing that with everyone lol.  Once I get settled and all my fishing gear and other belongings shipped out there I'll be sure to post some reports of the west coast fishing.  Brandon"
