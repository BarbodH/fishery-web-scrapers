92038,fishergirl72,2007-07-09 14:42:00,455,"Well after not being on here all weekend, I decided to catch up on all the threads. Fishindevil and I are up north for about a week, fishing the Ottawa River. He is out right now doing some fishing. I don't fish too much in the early morning as I find that I do better evening fishing. I have not been out yet as I am doing so catch up and spending time with family especially with my sister and brother-in-law, I have not really seen him alot or spent time with them since he has been back from Afganhistan, and he is headed back to Afganhistan next August again for another tour!   so I am hoping to get out on the water real soon!   The weather has been not that great, since we have been here it has been raining on and off and really damp, but not bad at all for fishing, so hopefully it will start getting nice real soon, before we go home.LOL Shawn has been catching some nice eyes. He will be making his reports when we get back home. I am on my parents computer right now, but we cannot do our pics on here, so we will wait until we get home to post pics and reports.    Have a good week everyone and we will post when we get back. I will be on here from time to time checking in, but I am going to be out on the water as much as I can and do some great fishing"
92039,ccmtcanada,2007-07-09 14:45:00,7971,Nice to hear from you Julie!  Cant wait to see the full report with pics.  Hope you guys are having a great time up there and that your little one keeps busy!
92044,fishergirl72,2007-07-09 14:51:00,455," Hi Cliff! Angelina loves it up here, we will be taking her fishing at times, taking her to the beach, going for ice cream, taking her to the park, etc. We are just waiting for weather to start clearing up a bit.   There is not too much to do here for a 5 year old when the weather is not ideal.LOL. It is actaully starting to clear up as I am typing this.LOL. Yay!   Take care Cliff."
92047,fishnsled,2007-07-09 14:57:00,3520,What the heck are you doing on here if your on vacation????    Great to hear from you and looking forward to the report when you get back.  Now get out there and get some fish!  Have a great time and be safe.

92057,Joey,2007-07-09 15:17:00,9122,"Enjoy your family time Julie, and hopefully the fishing will be good for your this afternoon.  I think the morning bite is highly overrated myself  I hope you are feeling better since the last time we communicated.  Joey"
92131,fishergirl72,2007-07-09 17:53:00,455," Thanks Joey! I am feeling better since then, especially after doing some great changes to my lifestyle. Some of my tests from the cardiologist has come back with good news, but I am still waiting for other tests to come back. I go to see him on the 23rd of August to get the update on everything. When I find out, I will pm you and let you know hun! Thanks for ""lending my your ear"" LOL. I will chat to you soon! I am hoping to get out on the water tonight, if it does not pour. It is sooooo humid here right now you cannot breathe."
