92078,rickster,2007-07-09 15:58:00,495,they can't stop you from fishing in the lake.
92079,Hookset,2007-07-09 16:00:00,367,"I would think that as long as you didn't cross private property to get to the Lake, then you have the same right as anyone to fish it. Outfitters will probably have a land lease or outright ownership of the property their cabins and campsites are on, so I would stay away from them. Otherwise, if it's crown land, you have every right to be there. I've fought this battle several times and it's amazing what people will tell you about access to THEIR lake.   Hookset."
