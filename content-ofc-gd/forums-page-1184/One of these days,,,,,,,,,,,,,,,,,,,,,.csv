The arms alittle sore from flipp,n and pitch,n but man is it fun. My boy and I hit a small lake just west of Barrie and it was just big enough to get the boat in.LOL  Lots of fish but really no size,but man they were fun just the same. Fish were caught on Crawtubes and wizzle worms again,in a varity of colours and the top water stuff worked great as well. Boy to watch the explode on a swamp frog.YOOOOOOO SSSSOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNN.LOL  Pics from the day.              "
91960,Spiel,2007-07-09 11:36:00,9065,....Top water is certainly a heart stopping riot Brian but man those Simcoe smallies is huge! Best get out there and locate those hawgs for me.
