91427,dsn,2007-07-06 22:28:00,1018,Went to my usual honey today after urbanangler and I fished it yesterday and the day was slow. I noticed a funny smell. Like rotten meat. I didn't find this yesterday til I looked in the water closer to shore today. In the first pic you can see 2 sets of feet. Thats means two ducks were killed. But there was more. There were least 5-6  sets of feet scattered leaving a trail in to deeper water. I tried to take a pic of the enitre mess but it didn't turn out. Even with these pics you can barely make them out.     Wonder  could it be a masive hungry pike that went on duck rampage to fill his hunger strikes?  Or was it humans trying to sample everything that moves?   dsn
91437,Joey,2007-07-06 23:48:00,9122,Wouldn't the pike just eat the feet too?  Joey
91439,misfish,2007-07-06 23:56:00,29133,"Ok you got me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It looks more like an ultra sound from mrs,s Shrek.LOL"
91454,fliptheslop,2007-07-07 00:33:00,112,They dont really even look like duck feet more like chicken
91456,camillj,2007-07-07 00:41:00,1988,Looks more like chicken feet to me ... not pike leftovers ...
91457,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-07 00:47:00,2585,yeah i didnt think pike would leave anything left?  interesting find for sure!
91458,Lostchild,2007-07-07 00:48:00,153,"""Looks more like chicken feet to me ... not pike leftovers ""  I was thinking the same thing,won't ducks feet be webbed?"
91460,Terry,2007-07-07 01:01:00,14456,someone put a voodoo curse on your fishing hole
91461,crappiesteve,2007-07-07 01:09:00,220,When is the chicken ready?Chicken legs all the way.  Steve
91463,dsn,2007-07-07 01:21:00,1018,Hmm everyone made a good point. I surely thought it was duck. But since like you folks mentioned its not webbed. Still why would someone toos chicken feet in the water. Voo doo?  aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!   dsn
91466,urbanangler1990,2007-07-07 01:37:00,933,"vodoooo!! nooooo, it will be good luck thats all, think about where else can u find chicken feet in a lake or pond,   maybe KFC cover up, hmmm"
91472,Stoty,2007-07-07 02:13:00,2910,"This brings to mind the age-old question.........  ""Why DID the chicken cross the road?"""
91481,oxcowboy,2007-07-07 02:51:00,544,"i cant tell the size of the legs in the pic, but they kind of look like frog legs to me, maybe somebody catfishing?  not sure if there are any cats there.  im sure a pike would have taken the entire duckling.  jason"
91482,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-07 02:53:00,1351,maybe some guys were eating chicken feet but then threw them over board... people do eat chicken feet!
91485,Mike the Pike,2007-07-07 03:01:00,3421,  Misfish  Where are the webbed feet??????  Looks like someone had a shore lunch picnic with live chickens .
91490,highdrifter,2007-07-07 03:22:00,2534, Was it Micheal Jackson?  At least the title was good.  Certainly got my attention quick!!  HD
91505,Greencoachdog,2007-07-07 07:19:00,8163,"Looks like the work of Cajuns to me... they'll eat anything yanno.  Joe, Art!... y'all got some 'splainin' to do..."
91520,aplumma,2007-07-07 12:24:00,6896,Chicken feet actually thats even to naste for us Cajuns to eat sorry dawg you got to keep lookin for another culprit.  Hey Roy I know that Frenchmen eat frog legs would you all like to claim chicken feet too???    Art
91561,Mike the Pike,2007-07-07 18:36:00,3421,Joe once again the feet are not webbed so that rules out frogs legs.Red neck Rooster perhaps  Oh and that happened in Ontario not Quebec.
91912,[emailÂ protected],2007-07-09 02:38:00,25,"I saw the same thing in my favourite fishing hole; a set of  bird/duck legs just standing there in shallow water among the tree stumps....creepy.  We have seen pike leap from the water for birds but I wouldn't imagine that they would leave the feet, just swallow it all head first.  It could have been a big snapping turtle. I know there is a huge one that frequents the spot where I saw my set of feet."
91979,blaque,2007-07-09 12:26:00,2419,"I thought frog legs too, but why would anything leave behind frog legs,  thats supposed to be the best part"
