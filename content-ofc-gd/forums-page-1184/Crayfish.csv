91539,Canuck2fan,2007-07-07 16:31:00,1444,You can no longer buy Crayfish in Ontario. You can however catch them. Get some boots a small minnow net and go to any local stream with a rocky bottom place the minnow net in front of you about 2 feet away and kick rocks from side to side. Lift the net put the crayfish in a container and away you go...

Can I say that on here?? hope so not really a swear word in UK"
