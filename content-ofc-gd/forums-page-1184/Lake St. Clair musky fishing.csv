Despite a slow 2006 musky fishing is starting to pick up. For those that did not hear LSC and many other waters were hit with VHS virus that killed LOTS of muskies on LSC. In 2005 I was fortunate to boat over 200 muskies and last yr word spread that things were slow, I also got the bug to fish more steelhead out of Wheatley. Well anyways musky fishing is going decent again, not sure if or when  we will see the double digits days of muskies again but hey many don't catch a musky in days of fishing other bodies. Now on with the report, I was fishing the Pike Creek to Puce River area in 10-14 FOW trolling Woodies and Talonz Slashers(www.fishall-lure.com) in Olive Frog and Perch patterns. Today we went 3-5 with the largest being a nice 47"". For those looking to head this way during vacation time water temps are about 72 and the traffic on the water is light.  Musky fishing should continue to be good with the stable weather upon us. And for those that enjoy silver bullet steelhead fishing, things around Wheatley to Erieau are starting to go good as well. And for those that enjoy a tasty meal of walleyes, the walleye fishing is still hot from Colchester to Leamington.   "

Limits of walleyes on Lake Erie from Colchester to Leamington so I have not post anything new. I will be fishing a mixed bag for the next 2 months as I will be chasing, bass, musky, steelhead and walleye on Lake Erie and LSC. "
