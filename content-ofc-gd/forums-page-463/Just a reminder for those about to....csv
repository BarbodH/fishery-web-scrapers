646357,Joey,2011-12-08 02:31:00,9122,I've seen that before and it impacted me the same way watching it again.  Very brutal and sends a message for sure!!!!
646358,ccmtcanada,2011-12-08 02:33:00,7971,"I remember an Ontario commercial on drinking and driving.  A little girl's mom was in an accident...drunk driver hit her.  She got to the hospital just as they pulled the sheet over her head.  The next thing you hear is the little girl wanting to see her mommy.  Some mumbling as they tell her.  The scream through tears of ""I want my mommy"" still sends chills through me at the thought of it.  If I'm driving, I don't even have one drink anymore because of that.  Thanks for posting that, as hard as it was to watch...it's a reminder to be smart."
646359,Grimace,2011-12-08 02:33:00,2020,That is heartbreaking.  Thanks for posting it.  Maybe someone who watches it will think of it at the last minute before they drive and change their mind.
