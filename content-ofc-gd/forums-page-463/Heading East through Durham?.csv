645810,Roy,2011-12-06 12:06:00,13728,Here's what I have:  A fiery tractor-trailer collision is creating traffic chaos for people who use Canada's busiest highway.  Ontario Provincial Police have closed a stretch of Highway 401's eastbound lanes in Oshawa after a tractor-trailer crashed and caught fire early Tuesday morning.  Police said the lanes are expected to be closed between Stevenson and Ritson roads until 11:30 a.m. to allow engineers to inspect a bridge and the road to assess the damage and determine if any repairs are required.  OPP said the fiery crash occurred under the Simcoe Street overpass at about 1:40 a.m.  No injuries were reported.  Police said the tractor-trailer wasn't carrying any hazardous goods.
