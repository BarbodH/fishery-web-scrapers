644844,Roe Bag,2011-12-02 14:19:00,246,   Exactly!!!!!!! Two strokes are load sensitive and will begin to bog down on the higher end of the power band much sooner than a four stroke.
644911,Tybo,2011-12-02 18:57:00,1373,"Cavitation is do to physics,Not the prop.Prop design 3 blade or 9 is to help eleminate Cavitation. When the boat is moving it is no longer in the water.This is do to fiction causing heat,Which in turn make the boat and engine run on air. Now prop design is to decrease the amount of air that runs around the prop giving more said bite. This is were the inconsistent torque of a 2 stroke is it's own down fall.It can't keep the said air pocket at a consistent size.Creating more prop cavition.decreasing lift.  In long runs you will get a more constance forward motion from a 4.which in turn gives more speed. Now in ruff water their is more air in the water then calm.   IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MATH!!!!"

This engine will be going on a 1850 Crestliner Raptor TE from Proctor Mairne and they can get either engine put on the boat. Right now we have a Sylvan 17 ft with a 115 Johnson 4-Stroke( a great boat and motor but getting old). Thankyou for all the info! Quinte Report. We got 6 walleye (10-2 lbs) all on pink or purple baits and 220-250 ft behind the boards. Most were caught at the ferry crossing area."
645475,dave524,2011-12-05 10:58:00,4508," If at any time you want to put a kicker on it for trolling, I think you will appreciate the almost 100 pound weight advantage of the E-tec. Over 500lbs. for the Verado plus a kicker think you will find a 18 1/2 foot tinner too heavy at the stern. I'd go the E-tec and put the weight and I assume cost advantage into a 4 stroke kicker, electric start, alternator and something like a trollmaster of control king for speed adjustment. Just my 2 cents as a predominately Great Lakes troller who has got a stern maxxed out weight wise"
645658,RickOnt,2011-12-05 21:30:00,669,"E TEc info  the E-TEC engine has what is called a total loss oiling system. The oil is recirculated throughout the motor and some is caught in the airstream and travels to the combustion chamber.  The oil is consumed completely during the combustion process. The E-TEC design is so efficient that it is still one of the cleanest internal combustion engines on record, yet it includes the oil that is used. It's emissions remain the same over time.  On a 4-stroke motor, as the hours add up, the pistons, rings and valve guides begin to wear and oil starts to leak into the combustion chambers through those parts and that INCREASES the emission output by a large amount. A 4-stroke gets dirtier and gives off more air pollution as it grows older. 4-stroke engine oil is not made to be burned in the motor so when it gets into the cylinder and is combusted, it gives off a large amount of emissions, deposits, and metallic byproducts.  Two-stroke oil such as XD-50 and XD-100 is formulated to be consumed and burned efficiently with minimal emissions or deposits."
645795,Tybo,2011-12-06 07:11:00,1373,"So the rings never wear on a 2 stroke,Letting fuel into the crank case. Then combusting ,Blowing up the engine.Or,When the engine sits for a time.The oil decides too run out of components,Like Wrist pins and rod bearings."
645998,Bernie,2011-12-07 00:07:00,3190,"On a two stroke anything that happens to go past the piston will be blown back on to the top of the piston. Air is pushed into the combustion chamber by the downward motion of the piston up through a port that goes up along the side of the cylinder. In non fuel injected two strokes the fuel/oil mix lubricated the crankshaft, cylinder walls and piston wrist pin.  But with direct injection the oil only needs to have the odd drop added to lubricate these parts as it is only air below the piston to be pushed up through the port in the cylinder. Fuel isn't there to wash it off."
646208,doubleheader,2011-12-07 18:18:00,497," I've been running a Verado since 2006, and I've never had a problem. My current 200HP Verado costs me $125.00/year to maintain. This includes engine oil/filter/gear lube/grease, etc. I buy a kit on the Verado club website and I do the work myself. It takes me about 4 hours to do annual engine maintenance, I'm sure others can do it much more quickly, I prefer to take my time. There are a number of useful u-tube videos to help the 1st timer.  All that said, if I were to buy another welded hull like the Raptor (I once owned a Fishhawk), weight would be a serious consideration in my decision. I'm not a big Liner fan. If you buy one make absolutely sure you test drive your boat before you purchase as they are known to have problems with excessive boathook which can be a nightmare to solve and seriously affects the boats performance."
646227,Tybo,2011-12-07 19:04:00,1373,"OK Bernie I think I got this right. With the E-tec.Since there is no fuel in the crank case,Even if fuel was to get by the rings on the compression stroke there would not be enough fuel in the crank case to cause crank case detination.You would just have a foul run engine do to the lack of compression.."
646304,Bernie,2011-12-07 23:14:00,3190,Yes Paul. If the rings ever got that bad the engine would have no compression and wouldn't start anyway.
644622,Tybo,2011-12-01 18:55:00,1373," I'm not sure what this means.I can't see how a super charged engine will not preform as good or better then a two stroke. I have a 200,4 cylinder verado on a 19' lund pro V.With 15 gallons of fuel and myself.It will almost launch the boat out of the water. It is so good on fuel,That I had to keep tapping on the gauge to make sure it was working. If I went back to a 2 stroke,I stay with a merc. In the world of outboard drag racing.Merc is still number one."
644628,Roe Bag,2011-12-01 19:10:00,246,"  I've run two strokes for forty years and my maintenace shedule has been the occasional set of plugs. The occasional impeller. Change the gear oil and check for water at the end of every season and motor on. Oh yeah, one fuel pump diaphram in my '73 Johnson. What part of ""hear say"" don't you understand? There's a fellow up on our lake that runs a 250 Verado on a 21' foot bass boat. It was he that told me that frequently (based on engine hours) he had to take it into the dealer for inspection and adjustments. He said if he didn't do so his warranty would be voided. All I did was suggest that the original poster look into it. A 200 Verado is a four cylinder and it out weighs the 6 cylinder etech by almost 100 lbs. I would imagine too that they are squeezing the guts out of a four cylinder to make 200 horsepower. Bombardier Recreational Poducts (BRP) states that their e tech engines need not be touched in the first three years. See what Mercury has to say about theirs. That's all I was suggesting. There is less maintenance in a two stroke simply because there are fewer moving parts. Less wear. Less breakage. As far as ""cow paddy"" ? Whatever!!   Obviously your budget can be stretched a whole lot further than mine. I cringe everytime I pull up to the gas pumps."
644632,hirk,2011-12-01 19:25:00,571,If he is putting on a performance hull like a glass bass boat the etec will out holeshot out midrange and out topend the verado. If its going on a tin or v pad glass hull than it doesnt matter neither are designed for performance per say
644670,Fisherman,2011-12-01 21:48:00,7201,I suspect most people here really couldn't give a rats gluteuous maximus how high the boat will launch or torpedo going down the lake.  There's always someone that will try and make more noise.
644672,Fisherman,2011-12-01 21:51:00,7201,"I look at it this way, if 2 strokes of any description(etec, no tech, whatever) were that good, they'd be putting 2 strokes in cars and trucks.  Hmmm, anyone heard any rumours lately.."

Personally I like the Etec for its light weight, low maintainence, fuel economy and great power. But I do have an honest affinity for the 2 strokes being raised on OMC stuff.  I'm being pushed to put a new Verado on my boat for next year.  Undecided myself.  PS.The Etec has less emissions than the 4 strokes."
644761,John Bacon,2011-12-02 02:15:00,3277, Not a chance. Two strokes put out more torque than four strokes. That is one of the main selling points of a two stroke engine.

644781,BillM,2011-12-02 03:26:00,17367,'Out torquing' is the wrong word to use..  There's a reason why a direct injected 2 stroke will usually out accelerate a typical 4 stroke engine....  It's the fact that the direct injected 2-stroke has almost instantaneous on demand power due to the design of the fuel system that makes them get up and go so quickly.
644782,HTHM,2011-12-02 03:31:00,4082,"Well Duke, ya gonna chime in?"
644787,fishdawg,2011-12-02 03:48:00,912, the voice of reason
644797,Tybo,2011-12-02 10:53:00,1373,"On deep V's is where the 4 strokes out perform 2's,With more consistent torque at high rpm's and all threw the power band.Making the 4 more efficient in ruff water. Running in waters where the the prop is leaving the water on a consistent bases and have to get off the throttle to keep a high rate of speed and the boat going in the right derection  . with the consistent torque of the 4.The prop will grab the next wave harder give more thrust.With a 2 you have to keep a higher rate of rpm's to adcheve the same rate of speed.Making it more difficult in keeping the same rate of consistency as a 4.When the prop re-enter the water.The more snappy torque from a 2 tends to give more prop slip when getting back on the throttle. Which in turn decreases lift.Dropping the boat farther into the water causing more drag.  Now, If I was going too propelle myself down the lake on calmer water.I would go 2 stroke.  No I wouldn't.I would start burning alchol and see what happens.  200hp at the prop,is 200hp at the prop."
644820,hirk,2011-12-02 13:31:00,571,"Tybo take a stop watch & gps and 2 boats identical to yours one with the etec the other verado and run em. The etec with out perform the verado in time to plan, 0-30mph and topend. The slip you mentioned has to do with the prop (some slip more than others) engine height,trim and hull design. A 4 blade extra cupped stainless will slip much less than say a 3 blade alum..They may both be rated at 200hp at the prop but the 2 stroke can under load run through the rpm range much quicker."

644526,Roe Bag,2011-12-01 13:33:00,246,Go see Clarence at Bay City Marine in Hamilton. (not far from Cayuga) They sell all of the big names. There are advantages and disadvantages no matter which way you go. Two strokes have fewer moving parts so there is less maintenance. Four Strokes are more efficient but come with a rigid and expensive maintenance schedule. Four strokes offer more torque but also add weight to the back end of the boat. My biggest concern would be the maintenance cost of the Verado. It's only hear say but I was told that in order to protect your warranty you must adhere to their (Mercury) maintenace program and it is said to be quite costly. BRP claims that their e tech doesn't need to be touched for the first three years.
644527,Billy Bob,2011-12-01 13:35:00,5865,If I had to choose between the 2 it would be the E-Tech hands down.
644538,Fisherman,2011-12-01 14:12:00,7201,Where is there less maintenance in a 2 stroke? How much more is the rigid and costly maintenance schedule for a 4 stroke? How much heavier are 4 strokes compared to 2 strokes? I think it's about time you read up on the answers instead of the 2 stroke vs 4 stroke cow paddy.
644541,lew,2011-12-01 14:25:00,12766," We spend tens of thousands of dollars for our boats and a truck to pull them, huge amounts of money for the electronics to navigate the boat and find the fish, 100's of dollars a year for the gas, much more for the yearly insurance, then boat ramp fees every week and a small fortune for our tackle and who knows what other expenses.  The amount of money to maintain a 4 stroke motor over the course of a year, compared to all the other expenses we have, is so small  it's hardly even worth talking about."

644544,Harrison,2011-12-01 14:34:00,2202,I agree with Gman.  Look at warranty and service locations as a big factor in your decision.
644546,Fisherman,2011-12-01 14:35:00,7201,"Well if you never get out of the driveway, then it doesn't cost anything."
644548,craigdritchie,2011-12-01 14:41:00,1586,Duke - what kind of motor do you have on the boat now? It will usually (but not always) be less expensive to re-rig with a new engine of the same brand as you had before.
644549,tonyb,2011-12-01 14:48:00,1637,"I would recommend a 4-stroke engine whatever brand you decide.  Cleaner, Quieter, no smoke fumes, no oil reservoir concerns...  I own a 225 Verado for a few years now and can't say enough good things about it, would buy another one again tomorrow.  That being said, they are not the only good engine in town, Yamaha as mentioned is another reliable and reputable brand.  For me the decision came down to the fact that it was several thousand dollars cheaper to power my Lund with a Mercury Verado than any other 4-stroke brand like Yamaha or Honda.  The reason it seems is because Mercury and many boat manufacturers (e.g. princecraft, lund, crestliner) are under the same parent company umbrella (Brunswick Marine) so they offer savings when you bundle boat and motor together.  Yamaha, Evinrude, Honda, etc are not part of Brunswick Marine...so you pay more to have a competing engine brand.  I purchased my rig and deal with Bay City Marine in Hamilton and overall they've been a good shop to deal with."
