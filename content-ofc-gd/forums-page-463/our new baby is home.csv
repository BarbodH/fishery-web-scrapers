645496,lew,2011-12-05 13:49:00,12766,"Cute Pup Simon and Jacks gonna love him, all kids should grow up with a dog. I think the cat may have a different opinion though"
645500,motion,2011-12-05 14:03:00,403,"Congrats on the new pup. He looks beautiful!! Boy does it bring back memories from not so long ago when my Toby was that small. He is now an almost full grown Lab but looked a lot like yours does just a year ago. I'll keep saying it, they grow up way to fast. Enjoy, they are great dogs."
645501,mercman,2011-12-05 14:05:00,7054,What a babe catcher !!!! He will give you years of comical pleasure my friend. Congrats  
645503,Ralph Field,2011-12-05 14:12:00,1018,That is one cute dog.
645505,Harrison,2011-12-05 14:32:00,2202," Cute pup, it is like having another infant in the home and as you can see above, poor Jack is already experiencing the effects of Second child syndrome!"
645510,johnnyb,2011-12-05 15:25:00,3413,"Awesome!!!!  Puppy pics...the next best thing to an ""ice man cometh"" report"
645739,Leecher,2011-12-06 02:17:00,7832,Cute pup Simon!!!  I better not show this to my daughter and wife
645750,limeyangler,2011-12-06 02:54:00,5204," Thanks Rick, well...when you come up next week you can tell him    Lol...she tore a strip off him within the first 15 minutes he was in the house...he does not go near her now and she is surprisingly at ease with him now...as long as he is mor than 12"" away.     I'm sure you are right...lol.    Thanks Maureen...he is pretty hard not to love. I see you have a new addition too.    Thanks Chris...everyone tells me they love to swim...he's in the right place if its true. Jack named him and constantly tells us he loves him.    Thanks C4C!    Thats really why we got him...Jack has been asking for a puppy ever since he was able to say so.    Yeah...that would suck! I will watch for that...thanks for the reminder Blair    Lol...i cant wait to see those floppy ears flying on the casting deck!"
645751,limeyangler,2011-12-06 02:54:00,5204," Lol...yeah...the cats were not amused...our other cat Bert has not really ventured from behind the washer dryer for the last 2 days!    Thanks Motion....i've always loved labs since i was a kid, my wife had one all through her childhood...so it was inevitable really.    Thanks Paul...babe catcher...why didn't i think of that...oh yeah...i'm married...lol.    Thanks Staffman...yup..melts your heart.    LOL...actually Jack has really taken a shine to Roloff and does not seem phazed at all by the attention not all being on him....i am very proud of the way he has been toward the dog...he's a good boy is our Jack.    LOL...with all the kids and puppies this year it was more like an ""iceman hath Arriveth"" report, lol...i never got round to even worrying about not being in the boat and waiting for ice...    Do it Jacques...i am surprised you do not have a dog."
645763,manitoubass2,2011-12-06 03:16:00,11391,"lol, i'll tell him Simon, if he hasn't figured it out by then  maybe I should bring my mutt pup down too, shes husky/rottweiler mix, and looks like your pup somehow?"
645772,GBW,2011-12-06 03:27:00,8460,"he's a great looking pup, enjoy your new addition Simon!"
645773,Joey,2011-12-06 03:29:00,9122,"That's awesome Simon, be prepared for alot less sleep.  Ralphie is finally sleeping through the night now, but gets up real early"
