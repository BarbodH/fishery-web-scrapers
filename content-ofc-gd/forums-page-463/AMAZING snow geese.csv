645922,ch312,2011-12-06 18:29:00,1590," exactly. if you think the cormorant problem is bad, you haven't done much reading about snow geese. the current regs on them are a daily bag limit of 20 birds and a possession limit of 60 per person. there aren't enough hunters targeting these birds as they often require tons of decoys for success and it's a lot of work.  it would be a good thing for other waterfowl, and snow geese themselves, if that entire flock was wiped out.  cool vid"
