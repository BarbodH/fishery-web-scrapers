With Xmas right around the corner, everyone could use a few more ducats in their wallet... so may I suggest that everyone take a moment today or in the next few, to click on an ad/banner! HH"

646160,Roy,2011-12-07 15:36:00,13728,Thank you for the kind thought Joe but may I suggest we only click on a banner if the product or service is of use to us. Banner clicks don't really help anyone and serves to falsely inflate advertising stats.  Thanks though....was a good thought.
646164,Headhunter,2011-12-07 15:59:00,5703,Good to know Roy... HH
