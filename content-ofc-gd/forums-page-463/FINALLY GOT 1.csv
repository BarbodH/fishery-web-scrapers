645333,Beans,2011-12-04 16:34:00,3339,Congrats on becoming a boat owner...  My nieces husband owns a Stratos (maybe a bit longer than yours) and was glad he had insurance on it when he ran up onto the old railway causeway which runs north of Harwood on Rice Lake (fog)...Blew the entire lower end...He replaced the 200 hp Mercury with a 250 hp Mercury...  Can now hit 80 Mph or thereabouts...the only time I wished I was wearing a seat belt on the passenger side...
645349,Ralph Field,2011-12-04 19:13:00,1018,"I would have called my 14 ft. aluminium boat a starter, your boat shouldn't be classed as a starter because it looks perfect to me. Congratulations and may you catch many fish out of it."
645358,mistaredone,2011-12-04 20:10:00,913,Sweet boat!! and one crazy first boat at that!  Congrats.  You can insure your boat under your home insurence.  Mine cost $10 a month and it paid out $6500 on a new motor when it was stolen.

645216,Dan668,2011-12-04 01:30:00,1120,"Mines a 17'9. I needed life jackets, 2 oars, fire extinguisher, whistle, waterproof flashlight, anchor, certain amount of rope, small bucket to get rid of water (forget the exact term), that's what was given to me when I bought mine. You don't need insurance but I got it. It wasn't too expensive"
645217,Dan668,2011-12-04 01:31:00,1120,"Btw, congrats on the purchase"
645218,cheaptackle,2011-12-04 01:32:00,849,"The mandatory safety equipment list is a part of the material you'll study to get the mandatory boater's card you're gonna need. I don't think insurance is absolutely mandatory but you better check with your agent to be sure, you really need a professional opinion there.  Boat that size must have cost a few bucks so I'm sure you'd want to protect it agains loss, and with all the (other) questionable operator's you may need the security.  Keep the wet side down and congratulations!  Michael"
645219,smally21,2011-12-04 01:34:00,993,go to the office of boating safety online for a list of req'd equipment. insurance not legal requirement.  stratos excursion style or bass boat?

645241,mercman,2011-12-04 02:28:00,7054,"Sweet Ride !!!! I know the feeling.I bought my new boat last January, and had to wait till April. I left mine at the dealer though, so i didnt have to look at it all winter That would have killed me. Congrats, and drive safely.Cant see if it has gps or sonar.If not, get one for the console and one for the bow."
645253,young_one,2011-12-04 03:48:00,620,"Great ride buddy! People have posted about safety equipments on board, I like to remind you about engine care and trailer servicing. Make sure you always have engine oil in the reservoir, if you hear the warning beep due to insufficient engine oil, you need to pop the hood and loosen this plastic cap to allow the oil to fill to the top. As for trailers, make sure you grease the hubs every 2-3 yrs. Always check your lights, straps and locks!"
645255,kickingfrog,2011-12-04 04:02:00,8333,"Man, I hope you don't have to look at it everyday until spring."

645264,HTHM,2011-12-04 05:45:00,4082,Very nice ride! You'll love the Opti I ran mine close to 100 hours this year and used only a gallon and half of oil. You should be good for at least 55MPH with that rig.
645267,Roy,2011-12-04 10:10:00,13728,"Good morning Scott. Congrats on the great boat. You're going to have a heck of a good time with that bomb for sure! As for your safety requirements, everything is quite straightforward. Just print off the link here and go shopping for what you don't have. This is all explained in the booklet called ""Safe Boating Guide"" (TP 511E).  Here's the link to the safety items page that concerns you. http://www.tc.gc.ca/...less6m-1791.htm  Have a great time.  ps. The booklet is available at Transport Canada offices or even at any OPP detachment."

645274,lew,2011-12-04 11:16:00,12766,"Very nice Scott and congrats on your 1st boat, she's a beaut !!  Your gonna enjoy the extra freedom now that your not stuck on shore all the time.  If you haven't had too much experience driving a boat with a larger engine, maybe get a bud to go out with you at the start, just till you get the hang of trimming it and anything else your not familiar with."
645275,Garnet,2011-12-04 11:34:00,2056,All tournaments require insurance.
645283,hirk,2011-12-04 13:07:00,571,Scott I have all the safety gear you need leftover from the store just call me price will be right.
