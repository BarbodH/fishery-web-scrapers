645969,jedimaster,2011-12-06 22:30:00,3472,"Well, here is my thought, I like it... Pretty deep eh..

645978,SirCranksalot,2011-12-06 22:56:00,3291,1 minor mod---just delete the Leafs.  Maybe the league an replace them with a real team in Hamilton!?
645979,kickingfrog,2011-12-06 22:56:00,8333,Still no word on how the semi finalists are seeded. Amateur hour.
645981,jedimaster,2011-12-06 22:59:00,3472,Gee man... no love at all...
645987,kickingfrog,2011-12-06 23:06:00,8333," Rarely has the count even done anything for the fans. His only priority is the owners, despite the fact that without fans the league is no difference then the 11pm beer league,.. except the beer leaguers care more."
645999,workwear,2011-12-07 00:13:00,592,heard on the fan that the semi's will be seeded by points from the regular season.....1 playing 4...and 2 playing 3....so its possible that 2 west coast teams could be playing each other...or 2 east coast teams.....could be intresting
646002,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 00:21:00,8333,"I've heard the same, but there is no confirmation."
646010,jedimaster,2011-12-07 01:43:00,3472,Sounds like the PA is not to pleased about this. They haven't signed off on it.
646039,tb4me,2011-12-07 02:50:00,3295,"I heard the same thing. The PA has the final say so it should be interesting...I also heard that if it does go thru, it leaves room for 2 more teams in the league..One in Toronto's conference...May be looking too far into it but im just sayin....."
646044,jedimaster,2011-12-07 02:56:00,3472,I would bet that florida and tampe move to markham and hamilton. Seems funny to have those two teams in a division with the rest being the furthest north east.
646136,torco,2011-12-07 14:05:00,656,I think it favours conference b the best (the new yorks)they have virtually no travel compared to the other conferences.
646148,jedimaster,2011-12-07 14:56:00,3472,"Yah well that is Gary's baby, he loves the greater new york area. I am sure Tampa and florida would have loved to be in the that conference versus having to fly over them to get to their's"
646157,grimsbylander,2011-12-07 15:23:00,3016,"Before any re-alignment occurs, how about this...if you can send in a picture of snow in the parking lot of your home arena, you get a spot. If not, relocate. Travel problem solved.   Let's not talk revenues!"
646166,lhousesoccer,2011-12-07 16:01:00,442,"My apologies if this is a stupid question.  I haven't had alot of time to read or digest what's out there on this new realignment proposal, but why would the Leafs be ranked lower than Florida and Ottawa within the same conference?  I thought part of the objectives of the new alignment was to eliminate the possibility of teams with less points getting a playoff spot over teams with higher points?"
646168,torco,2011-12-07 16:07:00,656, Yeah I figured of the 4 teams that voted against probably 2 were from florida.
646171,jedimaster,2011-12-07 16:16:00,3472, I just didn't really order them properly as I was only really conerned with the ones that made the playoffs. I'll fix it though for yah.   Another interesting thing in the current system last year the leafs missed the playoffs by 8 points. With the new system they would have missed by 11 points.
646177,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 16:43:00,8333,That old Patrick division has always had the sweetheart travel sched.  I think the floridas will be happy having snowbird butts in the seats even if they outnumber thier own fans.
