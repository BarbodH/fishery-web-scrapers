645835,bobkayla,2011-12-06 14:11:00,148,"i""ve got a helly hanson full peice floater suit that is getting pretty disgusting,,the wife won""t even go near it.i wan""t to clean it but don""t want to ruin it either,,if i put in the washing machine on cold will this harm it?"
645839,BillM,2011-12-06 14:18:00,17367,What does the tag on the inside say?
645842,Jer,2011-12-06 14:21:00,1426,"I would scrub it manually with soap and water, rinse with the hose or in the shower, hang to dry. Mechanical action in the washer won't do the seams any good."
645844,johnnyb,2011-12-06 14:27:00,3413, Yeah.  What does THAT say?
645849,Roy,2011-12-06 14:38:00,13728," Leave it alone. It'll float better if you don't touch it. In the meantime, it appears you've found the ideal place to hide your spending money."

645858,johnnyb,2011-12-06 14:48:00,3413,Roy is a genius!
645861,bobkayla,2011-12-06 14:54:00,148,"looked at that first,,dosn""t say anything about washing"
645870,Lunker Larry,2011-12-06 15:12:00,122,Contact them through their website. I'm sure they will provide you with the necessary info.
645872,Woodsman,2011-12-06 15:14:00,1286,From my Helly Hanson  -hand wash -hang dry -no bleach -no ironing -no dry cleaning
645875,Roy,2011-12-06 15:18:00,13728,"If you don't need a hiding place for your cash, this is the proper way to look after your suit....not only your brand, all brands.  Wash the suit with a mild detergent and hang to dry. Do NOT have dry cleaned, do NOT use bleach and NEVER put it in a drier. Only put the suit away once it has dried completely else you will find mildew stains on it.  That's it, that's all."
645876,Roy,2011-12-06 15:19:00,13728,Woodsman beat me to it.
645877,cram,2011-12-06 15:22:00,1733,"If you machine wash it use a front loader, not a top loader."
645878,mukluk,2011-12-06 15:23:00,196,"Hand washed my Mustang one-piece floater suit with warm water and mild soap. Rinsed well and hung to dry.  Now when I put it on I have biceps like ""popeye"". Chest and leg areas are ok; just the insulation material in the arms that balled-up."
645886,bobkayla,2011-12-06 15:53:00,148,"thanks for the info,,,as for the money i think she can find that no matter where i hide it"
645905,cram,2011-12-06 17:18:00,1733,"Safest is hand-wash, but for the record my helly hansen alpha washed up just fine.  Just use a front loader (no agitator to get wrapped up on) and use gentle cycle."
645914,SirCranksalot,2011-12-06 17:53:00,3291,"Be wary of using any detergents. I have a fairly expensive sleeping bag. It's not down but the manuf.(via e-mail from website) recommended a ertain type of ""technical wash"" (I think they called it) made by Nikiwax. They also recc a front end loaded washer."
646016,Sinker,2011-12-07 01:53:00,8692,"If you wash it, all the luck will be gone! I've never washed mine, I'm afraid too!  S."
646043,beginner,2011-12-07 02:55:00,542,"I have mustang integrity one piece suit and I wash it 3week ago by hands.. haha man it feels like freeking ton once you soak it water and try to squeeze haha.. you'll know what I mean..

646052,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 03:10:00,8333,"A bar of soap, and a long walk off a short dock?"
646069,dhickey,2011-12-07 03:57:00,1038,Dish soap. rince.compleetly. hang dry outsidide with 4 dryer sheets. longer the better.
