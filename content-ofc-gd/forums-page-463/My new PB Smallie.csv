645112,bucktail,2011-12-03 15:37:00,1857,"super contrast man that's a beauty fish. haven't seen you on here in a while,  been hunting banjo this fall. keep it up!"
645117,d_paluch,2011-12-03 15:54:00,343,what a football!  congrats on the PB. My best was this year as well...but it was a largie and maybe a pound or 2 less than that beast
645119,darsky,2011-12-03 16:04:00,586,I am confused about the setup. Those drop shot weights are designed to not get snagged. I am thinking the opposite for a fb head jig?????
645130,Stoty,2011-12-03 17:34:00,2910,"That is true in most cases, however the location I was fishing was a very flat bottom with minimal snags. 90% of the time I use dropshot weights. Whenever it is possible, the double rig is a wicked option!"
645134,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-03 17:44:00,26,awesome fish Jamie!
645285,Moosebunk,2011-12-04 13:26:00,3970,TANK!  Nice PB.

644252,Stoty,2011-11-30 12:21:00,2910,"I finally got out on the water for the ""fall bite"" on Simcoe with a good friend of mine, and one of the top Bass anglers around, Mark Kulik last Thursday, and boy what a great day it turned out to be!  Overall, it was a ""slow"" day, but we managed to boat quite a few nice fish, topped off with this TANK, and my new PB Smallie weighing in at 6.2lbs!!  Thanks again Mark!  "
644253,mercman,2011-11-30 12:25:00,7054,Man !! What a football Congrats on that big bugger   Paul
644254,fishindevil,2011-11-30 12:38:00,6254,"congrats man sweet fall bronze !!!! what a tank...and fishing with mark,thats cool,i hope you got that fish on his strike zone dropshot baits !!!!"
644255,SGP,2011-11-30 12:45:00,23,Very nice!
644256,Roy,2011-11-30 12:52:00,13728,A very nice one indeed.
644264,Rod Caster,2011-11-30 13:39:00,5784,Double trouble dropshot! What a great fish
644266,LucG,2011-11-30 13:46:00,779,Nice fish! How do like those new Spin Shot Drop Shot Hooks?
644267,cl_fishin,2011-11-30 13:47:00,138,"Very nice WTG, Simcoe sure produces some giants!!"
644268,Bob Devine,2011-11-30 14:05:00,251, Did you miss the drop shot with the football jig? A good way to cover two water depths and lotsa fun when you double UP!! Congrats on the pb.
644269,Rizzo,2011-11-30 14:05:00,4754,sweet grandmother's spatula that's a big bass  (a little more Ron Burgundy for you)
644279,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-30 14:33:00,0,"That's one for Ahab bro!! Guess you had your hands full with that one--what did Richard Dreyfuss say ""I think we need a bigger boat..."""
644286,cityfisher,2011-11-30 14:48:00,959,WoW Huge! too bad the season about done!
644292,jimmer,2011-11-30 15:11:00,2730,Congratulations on your PB!
644303,johnnyb,2011-11-30 16:20:00,3413,Way to squeak that pig in under the wire....nothin' like ending the season with a PB...well done sir!
644374,Rizzo,2011-11-30 22:14:00,4754,memories of that one should keep you going until late June!
644390,fishindude,2011-11-30 23:13:00,220,"Nice fish there! 6.2lbs is a MOOSE  That's an interesting rig there, gonna give that a try for sure next season. It's gonna be a long winter..."
644391,Whitespinnerbait,2011-11-30 23:19:00,2038,Pure Bronze right there  :worthy:

644439,limeyangler,2011-12-01 01:45:00,5204,"Congrats!  I,m guessing from the brand name on your hat we can expect a few good ice reports too!"
644456,Fishnwire,2011-12-01 02:44:00,983,"Absolutely beautiful fish right there.  How come you don't look happy in the pic?  I tried drop-shotting for walleye with a leadheaded jig and twister tail as a sinker once, but didn't have any luck and after getting snagged for the second or third time put a drop-shot weight on in place of the jig.  I think I'll try it again under more snag-free conditions, and for smallies too...you've inspired me."
644457,SGP,2011-12-01 02:49:00,23,That is an interesting rig...tell us more!
644476,Stoty,2011-12-01 04:07:00,2910,"Haha, thanks for the replies everyone! It was an amazing fish for sure!  I love the new hooks! Def recommend them to anyone!  Yes, I'm a big ice fisherman as well, but with any luck I'll be holding a new PB Walleye instead of a bass!"
644478,Stoty,2011-12-01 04:11:00,2910,"As mentioned, the rig was a double rig consisting of an xZone ""Slammer"" on the dropshot hook and in place of the dropshot weight we used a football head jig with an xZone ""Swammer"". Slowly dragged along bottom. It was my first time using that and...just might have to use it again! LOL   Edit - typo"
644496,Jer,2011-12-01 11:44:00,1426,"We've been using a similar, but much lighter rig for winter panfish on the Kawarthas. Light jig on the bottom with a drop-shot hook with minnow 12"" to 18"" up the line. Even get the occasional double header on one rod.  Nice bass, BTW."
644641,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-12-01 20:04:00,1107,"yeah thats a great rig I have been using it for a few years now but with a shakey head jig and with gulp, but have found the way of the slammer/swammer this year and love them just wish I could have connected with 1 that size rather than the uncountable 3-3.5lbers all summer   but I guess that's not all that bad either LOL AWESOME fish man"
