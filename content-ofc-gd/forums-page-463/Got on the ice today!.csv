645248,limeyangler,2011-12-04 03:06:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies folks...hopefully i'll be getting out at least once a week from now till ice out!    Before ya know it you'll be out there Dawg...its coming!     It did feel good to get out...have not wet a line for weeks now...it was killing me!      Will do amigo...i'm gonna go out to a different lake tomorrow...its about ten minutes up the road from the one in this post...its much deeper so maybe no ice and a return to where i went today.      Thanks tb4me.     Yeah...-40 celcius sucks...but it has it's advantages too.     I winterized my boat a good 2 weeks before i needed to....but i dont regret it...its a pain trying to do in the snow with a frozen hose pipe!       Seriously man...do it! Rick, if we dont get out before Xmas, give it another 5 weeks and we'll do Vickers for Lakers if ya like.      Awesome IF.....i have a feeling i would be the one taking pictures of your fish though!      Thanks man.....its been over a month since i ate fish...looking forward to lunch.   You like me really"
