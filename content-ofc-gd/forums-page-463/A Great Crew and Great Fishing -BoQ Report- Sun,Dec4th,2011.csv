645540,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-05 16:53:00,26,"I thought I'd post a quick modified report from Gene's report of this Sunday. I headed out this Sunday in the Grand Slam (Al's Big Boat) with Chuck, Gene, Jason and Al! Couldn't ask for a better crew! We fished from 8am-2pm. We had a great time along with some great hawg hunting. we went 13 for 15. 3 were over 11 lbs and the rest over 9 to 10 lbs with 3 smaller fish from the 4-6 pound range! Here are a bunch of pics we took.  So here's the Lineup, Grumpy Grizzly aka Chuck   Me,    The Wizard aka Jason,   Al.    And Gene,    The Grizz    Grizz   The Wizard  This fish was almost as long as the Wizard is high,    Another respectable Fish    Me,      Al with some goods one's,      And last but not least Gene,       Here's some miscellaneous picks from a fantastic day!            All of us definately ended the season with a nice BANG!  Aadil  "
