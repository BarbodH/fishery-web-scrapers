644989,msp,2011-12-02 23:46:00,1336,What the heck happened to your thumb ? You could play hockey with that thing !
644991,misfish,2011-12-02 23:54:00,29133,  LMAO
645007,kemper,2011-12-03 01:11:00,2232," Forget the thumb, look at the size of that tail!  My thumbs both do that, never noticed that it was weird..."
645039,msp,2011-12-03 02:16:00,1336,Im just bustin your balls Kemper. That is a rather large caudal peduncle. You know its big when you cant get your hands around it
645051,kemper,2011-12-03 03:04:00,2232," Don't worry, I'm saving that report until everything freezes over and winternet has set in. Then we can all sit around and debate whether it was 16.2535 or 16.2531 pounds, whether or not it was ethical that I caught it on roe, and whether or not it is in fact an atlantic salmon.  Cheers Thumbmaster"
645080,BillM,2011-12-03 10:19:00,17367,"I can tell, it's an Atlantic caught with egg sacks."
645087,Garnet,2011-12-03 12:48:00,2056,"The steelheaders that think they are more ethical because they don't use roe are just ""losers"". Sum how they think it's great to make Steelheading difficult.  What's more important is the people that show up every year with there tackle boxes and 7ft rods. These are the people that drive steelheading they go out and buy new rods, new reels, buy all the products necessary for success.  All us guy/girls that have spend our $1000 are just a drag on future product development, nothing new will ever happen because our money is spent."
645102,solopaddler,2011-12-03 14:41:00,8605,  Speak for yourself LOL!
645109,esoxansteel,2011-12-03 15:21:00,1307,"  Come on Garnet you have lots of money, are you not related to the couple in the Shwa that won the 50 million on the Lotto Max, everyone else is"
645122,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-03 16:50:00,0,Wow--still losing sight of the irony. My eight year old gets it--others here obviously don't LOL  
645128,solopaddler,2011-12-03 17:28:00,8605,"  You're a bit too high brow, might to dumb it down a bit.  I have no idea myself what you're referring to."
645136,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-03 18:05:00,0, No worries Solo Post pending bro
645169,kemper,2011-12-03 22:08:00,2232, I was talking about Atlantics...did I miss something?
645171,Harrison,2011-12-03 22:12:00,2202,"I'd like to publicly thank Mother Nature, she was very kind the last couple days.  Hope everyone else had some fun on the banks."
645192,Garnet,2011-12-03 23:51:00,2056,Just ordinary Phil same old.
645344,kemper,2011-12-04 18:16:00,2232,"  Egg saaaaaaacks. The bait of choice for Atlantics.  On a more serious note, mother nature was indeed kind to us this week."
645390,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-04 22:23:00,0,"Best fish of the day today (fat with eggs)--on a tiny little nymph...  I am out of ""egg saaaaacks"" so I thought to ""chunk her up for the smoker"" and butcher her for the eggs... Naaahhh...I set her back for the ""sportsmen""   No eggs so will need to tie some more flies and though the smoker is empty I did manage to ""catch"" a beautiful meal of bruschetta pizza at Terroni's  NO IRONY HERE (period)  "
645434,OhioFisherman,2011-12-05 01:30:00,6623,"They were incidental catches for me while fishing for bass in Lake Erie and it`s tribs. Usually started catching them around mid October here around the river mouths.  It has been the wettest year on record here, I can`t picture the rivers that I fished being clear."
644500,Harrison,2011-12-01 11:58:00,2202,on the Lake O tribs jonesing with anticipation about the next couple days? Talk about ideal timing and perfect weather.
644502,aplumma,2011-12-01 12:04:00,6896,Yea yea rub it in you all got salmon to catch and all of mine live in the fishmarket.   Go get um and have a good dinner in my honor.   Art
644506,Roy,2011-12-01 12:20:00,13728,"What are you talking about, Art? You suddeners have the ever delectable blue catfish! Not a catfish fan but the blues are beauties."
644510,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-01 12:38:00,0,Steelhead???? In Lake O tribs????? Never heard tell...wierd.
644519,Garnet,2011-12-01 13:16:00,2056,Nothing special same old for last 2 month. Little bit cold maybe you stay home!
644523,Harrison,2011-12-01 13:29:00,2202, Personally love the cold and fresh runs of late fall steelhead.  Just excited to get out is all.
644525,BillM,2011-12-01 13:30:00,17367,Lots of chrome will be banked!
644552,tonyb,2011-12-01 14:53:00,1637,Hmm what will they be hitting?...oh yeah pretty much anything and everything!
644560,MJL,2011-12-01 15:19:00,2427, I chummed every lake O river this morning with my secret amino acid and pheromone enriched roe...Iâ€™ve programmed the fish not to hit anything else
644565,bassman87,2011-12-01 15:29:00,586, if youre producing roe you should go get check out by a doctor
644573,Harrison,2011-12-01 15:56:00,2202," You got it.  Went for a drive yesterday, nice to see fresh silvers clearing a dam with a couple feet to spare.   I have my Omega3 brown roe ready incase."
644640,kemper,2011-12-01 19:59:00,2232," You missed one! Don't worry though, he was only a minnow  "
644643,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-12-01 20:09:00,1107,I wish the  Erie tribs would clear that fast    gonna be a week at least with no rain darn clay . I am gonna give it a shot on sunday but not expecting much
644644,BillM,2011-12-01 20:18:00,17367," I'm guessing you're talking north shore, because alot of the southern shore Lake E tribs clear super fast."
644647,kemper,2011-12-01 20:26:00,2232," You might be surprised - its December so a lot of the water that would normally leech into the systems is going to lock up in the ground.  The creeks I fished today actually got dirtier as the sun came up and melted the ice, but I expect them to be prime again in the morning"
644659,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-01 21:17:00,0," Catt will be blown until the weekend--should be fishable then. Larger tribs still a little high and coming down however the Bufallo area is expecting rain on Friday which should put you in good stead for Sunday. I may be there also.  There are a couple of tribs that stay relatively clear or clear VERY quickly and, though on the small side, hold large numbers of fish that run an average of 8-12lbs.  Best of luck"
644919,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-12-02 19:25:00,1107,"Yeah I'm talking about North shore I live 2 mins from the river and it's still barely in it's banks and chocolate milk colored. I do know some smaller tribs that will be fishable, just gonna have to drive a hole 15-20 mins instead of 5 to get to the open section I only have a few hours sunday morning so we will see what happens."
644931,Remastered,2011-12-02 19:54:00,143,Guys there's no such thing as steelhead. Leave the tribs alone for us fish surveyists
644941,BillM,2011-12-02 20:27:00,17367," Catt's at 846, I don't think it's going to fish until early next week (as long as they don't get anymore rain)"
644942,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-02 20:29:00,0, Certainly not REAL anadromous fish in any event
644955,solopaddler,2011-12-02 21:07:00,8605, They are most certainly not. Potamadromous they are however.
644963,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-02 21:50:00,0, Yup--indeed
644969,SirCranksalot,2011-12-02 21:59:00,3291, The last big 1 I hooked felt more like hippopotamadromous!!
644976,solopaddler,2011-12-02 22:36:00,8605,  Good one.  Every time I use fancy words like that I feel like Niles Crane.
644986,SirCranksalot,2011-12-02 23:40:00,3291,"  If you hit any fitting that description and lose them, PM me with the GPS co-ords!"
