645695,tb4me,2011-12-05 23:22:00,3295,"The producers of this beer  commercial borrowed a small150 seat cinema playing a popular film, and filled 148 of its seats with rough-looking, tatooed bikers, leaving only two free seats in the middle of the theater. They then allowed theater management to sell tickets for the last pair of tickets to several young couples.  What would you do?  Watch till the end .....  http://www.theinspiration.com/2011/09/carlsberg-stunt-in-cinema/"
645699,Rizzo,2011-12-05 23:35:00,4754,"I would definitely take the seat. When I go into a theatre I never pay attention to the other people there, who's sitting where etc...so much so that I often regret taking a certain seat (ie beside the people with the baby, beside the guy with the runny nose, partially on top of the guy who's flubber is on my seat etc).; In other words I need to wake up and be more selective!"
645716,Joey,2011-12-06 00:45:00,9122,Definately would have taken a seat
645722,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-06 01:21:00,627,I'll be honest here. That is definately a cool commercial but I know I would have taken my bride and popcorn and got my money back. Or scalped the tickets to the next two guys on Harleys
645724,Roy,2011-12-06 01:24:00,13728,You pay for the ticket and you go take your place in the theater. No need to be worried. Those dudes are all hired actors whose day jobs include hairdressing and designing floral arrangements (not that there's anything wrong with that). They're not going to beat you up. The worst that can happen is that you leave there with spiffy new hairdo and a gardenia in your boutonniere. Enjoy the picture.
645726,dhickey,2011-12-06 01:38:00,1038,Show off my new ink. Enjoy the beer. Check out the bikes. Make a few new friends. The girl is well whatever.
