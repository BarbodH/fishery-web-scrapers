645266,BFSC Kevin,2011-12-04 07:49:00,1351,"My fall fishing report. Post downrigging for salmon.   Sept After throwing myself into downrigging for salmon in the big lake, I threw myself into float fishing. I purchased a Kingpin as my first centerpin. I matched it with a 10ft convergence that I had laying around and used that for a bit until I got a streamside and borrowed a raven im8.   On my first trip with the pin, I was able to land myself a brown.   I was also quite happy to find out that my roe was able to catch fish! Albeit they are not large, atleast something was attracted to them.    a little jack at night    Sept 19 First real lake run rainbow in the river with a pin.   Female coho that threw some dirt at me.   Sept 26 First decent sized rainbow! Caught shortly after first light. I did try to get it on video with my iPhone but it was difficult to get good footage.   Also caught a small little brown around noon that day.    Sept 29 The guys decided to try something different. We headed out towards the lake and what great fun it was! I was able to land 4 that day.    This fishing was just awesome. We were all standing out in the lake, drifting out.   With the sun in our face, the glare on the water and the waves. At one point, the winds picked and the waves got larger. It was difficult to know where your float was. However, it was still fun - I still caught fish. The way I described it to the guys was like this, ""I don't see my float..I don't see my float..I don't see my float..!!!!!!!!"" *set the hook* ""HAHHAHAHAHAHHAH fish on""   One of the guys with a tank.   Oct 9. After spending more than a month on the rivers. My boat was crying for me. I have never really targetted for fall bronze, Me and Kelfun thought we should give it a try. We headed to Simcoe in hopes of some smallies and jumbos, if the smallies didn't cooperate.  We did see some 5lb+ smallies swimming around, but they didn't want to come play. However we did manage some other kinds of fish....  first fish of the day     a big aggresive rockbass    we did manage some decent perch      Oct 23 Back to the rivers to see if I can manage some of those steelies.     We did manage a nice fish but I'm too lazy to edit the picture to show publicly.  November Not much fishing done,nothing really to show for it.  Nov 23-24 Day 1 with youngone and LincolnG In search of eyes. I had two days off from work and I had previously talked to will about fishing for walleyes. He booked us a motel and got a buddy to come along. Although there was a storm watch, he wasn't going to allow for any backing out. In the morning as we head towards our destination, we saw 5-6 cars that fell into the ditch of the 401 because of icey/snowy conditions. Luckily we arrived unharmed.   Although outside was cold, the action was hot! Between the 3 of us, we landed over 25 fish, with 3 over 10 lbs on the first day. I got the first walleye of the day   release shot   double headerrrrr     Release video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieaBGU4aYUo  Shimano and Loomis new pro staffer????          my final fish of the day      final fish of the day, Lincoln's new PB, I think it was 12 lb 7oz *edit, it was 12lb7, not 11lb7*    After a long day of hard work, we headed in for some grub    Day 2 It wasn't as good as Day 1, but it was still a great day. We landed over half a dozen.           It was great fun.  Hopefully I'll have some of the success I had during this trip, next time.    Dec 1 Hoping to repeat the success we had. youngone and I headed back in search of more walleyes. I had invited Linc a bit too late. He got my msg after we arrived there already. youngone was still in search of breaking the 10lb mark. It didn't happen today... maybe next time.  On first cast, before the net was ready, before I had my lure on and before the cameras were ready, youngone hooks into one.   but not too long after, I get into one myself.     another one   a couple by youngone   releasing them after a photoshoot    a video by me... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQVJvKbyPGU&feature=channel_video_title     That is all for now, I may head out one or two more times before I need to winterize the boat. Hope you guys enjoyed the pics and videos. Some photo credits do goto Linc, Will and Par."
