645386,scugpg,2011-12-04 22:12:00,1373,Make sure the connections are tight on the battery and on the quick-connect.

645415,Roy,2011-12-04 23:53:00,13728,Google searches say that a green light that's constantly on with the amber/orange light flashing is a bad connection. This is how they put it.  Explanation 1: Bad connection. Test: Move the clamps and make sure there is no loose connection in the quick connector.  Explanation 2: The charger is working in the desulphation phase. Test: Leave the charger to charge for 24h (with some supervision). If the charger does not start charging (one of the LEDâ€™s are lit) within 24h the battery is in a very poor condition.
645516,tonyb,2011-12-05 15:47:00,1637,Explanation 3:  CTEK Chargers can only recognize batteries less than 25 years old.  Stop being so cheap and just go buy a new one
