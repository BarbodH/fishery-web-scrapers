646186,Billy Bob,2011-12-07 16:57:00,5865,"Ya, very old....was posted in yesterday's paper...and you WILL be getting him back...."
646187,Pikeslayer,2011-12-07 17:01:00,1443, First time I heard about it  just sayin......
646188,fish_fishburn,2011-12-07 17:05:00,1311,Wasn't hi nick name the Village Idiot when he played?.... Or was thats Ties handle.
646191,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 17:21:00,8333,It was news on Sunday. ESPN fired him Monday.
646195,jedimaster,2011-12-07 17:36:00,3472,"Nice driving a cayene with a missing tire? I didn't like him when he played hockey, I didn't like him when he was on TV, and I don't like him now. Send him to Ottawa if you have to. Thats where us real canadian hockey fans send our useless washed up hasbeen's."
646197,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 17:38:00,8333,"Ya, how loud do you have to have the radio to not hear that?"
646201,Whitespinnerbait,2011-12-07 17:50:00,2038,   After 16 beers you tend not to hear very well
646214,Harrison,2011-12-07 18:27:00,2202,He's definitely got a few lug nuts loose.
646215,jimmer,2011-12-07 18:31:00,2730,He was a loser on the ice and now proving that he is one off the ice. I never understand how someone can throw away such amazing opportunities in life by making stupid decisions.
646216,GBW,2011-12-07 18:32:00,8460,I met him and had a few beers with him back in 2008 at the Wayne Gretzky Classic golf event.  He was a rather nice guy but you could tell it was all a show.  It's sad to say but will he be next?
