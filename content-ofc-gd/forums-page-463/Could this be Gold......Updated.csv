645200,Whitespinnerbait,2011-12-04 00:37:00,2038,Was out driving around with my wife this morning and seen these two Eagles feeding on a deer carcass.One of them looks like its a GOLDEN Eagle ?? The other a Juvenile Bald Eagle.  Any thoughts?       
645228,Dave Bailey,2011-12-04 01:51:00,1641,"I believe the upper one is a golden. If I recall correctly the bill of the bald eagle is yellow in the first year, can't remember for certain though. There are quite a few in Ontario, mostly in the far north. Can't remember how many were seen on the local fall hawk watches this year."
645240,Joey,2011-12-04 02:25:00,9122,Hard to tell.  This is the Golden I photographed this summer but he was pretty high up and I was at my fullest zoom.  
645258,Leecher,2011-12-04 04:14:00,7832,"Paul, I'm no bird expert and can't help you on this but that's some pretty good shots by Cathy"
645282,Dave Bailey,2011-12-04 12:55:00,1641,"Just checked the local figures. For this season the Cranberry Marsh Raptor Watch in Whitby had 2 golden eagles, the High Park watch in Toronto had 11, and the Iroquois Shoreline watch near Brooklin had 32. The Holiday Beach Migration Observatory in extreme southwestern Ontario, the area many raptors would funnel into before crossing the border, had a season total of 119."
645288,Gregoire,2011-12-04 13:38:00,1397,The top one could be a juvenile bald as they have a heavy black bill. Apparently golden eagles are quite rare in Eastern North America.
