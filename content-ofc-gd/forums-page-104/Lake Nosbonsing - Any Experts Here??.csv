991423,Woodsman,2017-01-17 00:06:00,1286,It's been a few years now but I fished it regularly each summer.
991428,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-17 01:14:00,8243,"Nothing in many years. My former Father in Law had a Walleye honey hole there he had been going to since he was a kid. We would go from Nip to there for at least 1 day during the summer. Same exact presentations as Calendar Bay, troll worm harnesses and white or yellow stand up jig with worms and trailer hooks, pretty simple."
