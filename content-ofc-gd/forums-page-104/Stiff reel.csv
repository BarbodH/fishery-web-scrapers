992640,skdds,2017-01-25 15:31:00,195,"Hi guys  Seems that one of my reels is stiffening out on the ice, better at room temp at home. I was thinking there is moisture that is freezing up inside the reel but it should be dry as was indoors since last winter. Reel is an aluminum Pfllueger. Any suggestions?  Thanks Skdds"
992641,Sinker,2017-01-25 15:33:00,8692,It needs a good cleaning and new oil inside. I had trouble with those same reels on the ice.   S.
992645,John Bacon,2017-01-25 16:06:00,3277,Perhaps a lighter grease/oil would help.  The lubricant would become thicker in the cold.
992646,Tom S,2017-01-25 16:08:00,362,"Some grease and oil formulas can absorb water, causing what you're seeing at colder temperatures. A good clean out with WD-40 (water displacer formula #40) and a re-grease with a water-resistant grease would fix you right up.  Surprised that Pfluger would use a non-moisture resistant grease. Unless the water has just worked into and emulsion with the oil or grease due to the action of the gearing."
992648,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-25 16:29:00,10439,"Yup, grease is thickening due to the cold. Happens with all reels up here unless you remove the factory grease and use something lighter. I clean out the factory grease and relube with hot sauce for flawless cold weather use."
992649,BillM,2017-01-25 16:30:00,17367,Sewing machine oil will work in a jiffy.
992658,wallyboss,2017-01-25 17:16:00,1095,"Every winter I used to put my winter reels in the freezer for a day, just to make sure they wouldn't do that. The one's that did got a major cleaning."
992663,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-25 17:29:00,10439,"Every winter I used to put my winter reels in the freezer for a day, just to make sure they wouldn't do that. The one's that did got a major cleaning.  I stick em out on the porch. It's way colder there than in my freezer!!!!!"
992665,OhioFisherman,2017-01-25 17:46:00,6623,"It's probably not the case with your reel as it is newer and only happening in the cold, but I collected old reels, the grease in some hardened with age.  Sounds like it needs a good cleaning and fresh lube."
992667,skdds,2017-01-25 18:28:00,195,"ok, thanks for all the great responses! If this is an easy fix myself I'll do it or perhaps I am better to send in to a local shop to clean it out and specify cold weather use for the correct grease. Not sure I want to take apart the whole reel. Next year I'll be more prepared.  tx skdds"
992670,wallyboss,2017-01-25 19:21:00,1095,"It's not a hard thing to do skdds,  Just take off the side plate spray in a degreaser (WD-40 works)  Q-tips to remove the old grease and put in some new. Grease on gears , drop of oil on bearings.  Youtube has plenty of videos to show you how!!!"
992694,FloatnFly,2017-01-26 00:04:00,1640,"its simple, basic reel maintenance, its like putting air in your tires.  very very simple.  remove the handle, take out the 3 screws, clean out with q-tip, put new lube in. done  only tools needed is a small precision phillips screw driver, a q-tip, new grease, and maybe wd-40."
992716,skdds,2017-01-26 02:03:00,195,"Thanks for the tips, saw a few utube vids and will give it a go.-skdds"
992733,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-26 10:12:00,8243,What type of grease would you guys recommend?
992739,Tom S,2017-01-26 12:37:00,362,Quantum Hot Sauce
992745,wallyboss,2017-01-26 13:16:00,1095,Quantum Hot sauce oil and Quantum Hot Sauce grease.  That's all I use.
992786,NANUK,2017-01-26 19:26:00,797,"Full synthetic reel grease with PTFE I use Super Lube grease and oil on all my reels, very smooth and never have freezing problems, https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.1000735868.html?eid=PS_GOOGLE_HD+%7C+PLAs_Shopping+%7C+All+Products_All+Products&gclid=CIGc0eLD4NECFRC1wAodAa0MUA  I have used Cal's reel grease in the past and it is excellent too. I believe Shimano's reel grease is good as well but no personal experience."
992885,pics,2017-01-27 15:56:00,1268,I have the same problem with mine..  Same brand but taking it apart is a lot tougher than a Shimano.  I gave up trying and only use it on my ultralight in warmer weather.
