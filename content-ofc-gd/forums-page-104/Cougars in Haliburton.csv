I don't think cougers would be very effective at controlling coyotes.  The stories about the MNR using them to control deer at least much a little bit sense... not a lot of sense, but some."
992892,bare foot wader,2017-01-27 16:21:00,1354,"I do believe there are likely a few wild cougars that have reclaimed some of their historical range in ON, but would agree with the one poster that track looks pure dog to me  it's longer than it is wide, 4 distinct claw marks which typically only see on a running cat, can form a straight line X between the pads, toe position on the outside toes are too far back to be a cat...without something for scale I'd guess domestic dog  also quite common to see tail drags from a cougar"

I don't think that any of the original eastern cougars remain.  There may be a few escaped/released pets as well.  But if would be difficult to re-establish a wild population with domesticated animals."
992952,chris.brock,2017-01-28 01:56:00,4053,"Yeah, I'm familiar with those criteria Barefoot.  I think canine claws would make a sharper, deep imprint in the snow. I think that's toe drag, no claws. I think it's elongated because it's moving forward, it still looks wider than long to me.  Whatever it is, the scat has lots hair (probably rabbit) so it's probably not domesticated.  In this picture the print in the top left would have a claw mark breaking that clean piece of snow if it was canine.  "

He lives for the outdoors and travels across Ontario and the country and US hunting and fishing , if they are out there he may have seen one in his many hours in the bush. He reminded me of what happened in our neighbourhood in the early 60's. Mom said around 61 or 62 just before some kids burned it to the ground. I would have been 8 he 6 or so. We lived a few blocks below the Niagara Escarpment in east Hamilton. There was a lumber yard on Lawrence Rd. and Rosedale. There was a big commotion one night with Police and Fire at the lumber yard. Our Mom let us go see what was going on less than 100 yards from our home. There was a Mountain Lion treed in one of the huge Scandinavian pines on the property. The night watchman heard it went to look and found it up a huge tree. The Police told everyone to go home. They shot it dead we were told the next morning. We heard the shot. I forgot all about that, it was a long time ago. I'm prey good at stories but not good enough to make that up.  Heading to Nipissing in a few hours, no sleep tonight too excited!! I won't be driving I guess, good excuse. I'll keep my eyes open for some wildcats up north."
993010,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-01-29 18:26:00,535,One thing to remember when looking at tracks is a cougar's tracks aren't actually that big for that size of cat. Wolves and even a lynx would have bigger tracks.

I have my own story that I don't talk about too much because I don't want people to think I'm crazy but I know what I saw . About 8 years ago I was driving in the area just NW of Orangeville when I seen something walking on the side of the road . It was approx. 100 yards in front of me and I first thought it was a big dog which didn't really alarm me but as I got a bit closer I realized it wasn't a dog but couldn't really tell what it was . I quickly sped up to see if I could identify the animal and of course it disappeared down into the ditch in the blink of an eye . There were two things that really stuck out with this encounter and one of them was the animal had a long thick tail that I immediately noticed as I got closer and realized it was not a dog and the second thing was where I seen the animal it was fairly open farm land and a fence row with scrub and trees . I was not that far away from the animal when it jumped into the ditch (dogs don't evade) and I fully expected to see it in the field or in the tree line but do you think I seen it again , no chance ! What ever it was, it made off at lightning speed or was good at hide and seek . Now , I know what I saw that day and the details are etched strong into my head. I still can't imagine it would be a cougar but that is the only thing it could of been. I Believe !!!!"

The one I saw by janetville jumped clear across a 2 lane road in one leap. The one at Lingham lake walked across an opening along the shore of the lake in a very secluded bay. Thought it was a deer at first, but there is no mistaking a big cat like that. We were only about 70yds from it.  There is no mistaking the tail on these cats. And the size of them is scary!  I hope you get some info back, Chris. Would love to hear it.   S."

Me and other people have seen tracks around the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park of what we think are big cats.  The best I have seen were in sand at a dump.
