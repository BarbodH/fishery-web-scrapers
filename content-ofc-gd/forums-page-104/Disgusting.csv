992875,SirCranksalot,2017-01-27 14:22:00,3291,"Ok, thx---never caught a sturgeon or saw one up really close."
992877,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 14:28:00,11391,"Yeah, you dont wanna be the guy caugjt poaching sturgeon. Its WAAAAAY stiffer laws than other gamefish. These are a protected species.  Ive caught them walleye fishing but you cant target them thats for sure.  The MNR are cool about a quick pic and release but your actually not supposed to even remove them from the water as youde be in possession.  My area is where they spawn in huge numbers. So I see alot of people get busted targeting them"
992878,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 14:33:00,11391,Anyways back on topic  I see nets set here and they are all identified (on rainy river)  I see a few nets here and there on LOTWs unidentified and call them in.  Ive only been asked by COs to call them in but im not sure of the legalities of it???  I think they are interested mainly in unattended nets but im not positive on that.  A net should only be out for 8 to 12 hours. Otherwise its gonna risk spoiling gamefish
992888,Fisherman,2017-01-27 16:12:00,7201,Keep up the good work.
992913,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 20:43:00,11391,15 years in prison?
992949,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-28 01:47:00,8243,"So a net has to be identified or it isn't? It would have to be one dumb poacher to ID his nets.  Akri, you were speeding. You got caught. All Cops should also act as Conservation Officers and trained to do so. That won't be happening I'm afraid.  Are Police allowed to fine violators as would a C.O.?  Those pics of dead Sturgeon make my stomach sour. What kind of animal would do that? I'm all in for capital punishment for crimes to natures innocent animals by sub human animals. I was told by some unsavoury men when I was a kid if you are going to commit a crime do it in Ontario.  Not to be taken as a political comment."
992950,manitoubass2,2017-01-28 01:49:00,11391," The only kicker is a police officer cannot confiscate your vehicle/gear, or enter your home without a search warrant.  A CO can."
992953,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-28 02:07:00,8243,"As far as I.D. on a minnow trap if I remember right if it is a commercial trapper it needs to be ID'd  or it is a fish cage for game fish those need an ID. I don't need a to ID my trap on my property. I need to find it. I grabbed 1/2 dozen copies of the regs last year as they are so rare, think I kept one?  I'm wrong, again. It says bait traps need ID and only a license holder can trap bait. I take that to be a person with a Fishing license. Nothing about ID for a dip net. You would be the ID as you need to throw it. Better have your fishing license on you."
992997,G.mech,2017-01-29 01:24:00,830,"Yes, police can act on conservation laws 100%  The only kicker is a police officer cannot confiscate your vehicle/gear, or enter your home without a search warrant.  A CO can.  Not to split hairs as it's kind of off topic but as you say, a CO can enter a building without a warrant but NOT your dwelling.  This is a common misconception that they would like you to believe but it's simply not true.  It is covered in Section 90 of the Fish and Wildlife Act which states: "

992750,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 13:43:00,5558,"FFS  seriously, if they find out who did this, I dont Give a turd if its the pope, wayne gretzky, the entire town of wawa or whoever is friggin responsible for this garbage...They better get jail time, and more than a month like they love to give to these murderers.  enough with the fines, enough with the Bull jail sentences...this is literally as poor as if I were to go out and murder 1000 people's family pets and then throw all of their rotting carcasses in queens park.  I think its time we rethink minimum sentences for this kind of garbage."
992752,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-26 13:54:00,8243,When was the last time you read of jail time for these goof poachers? Unless someone has loose lips or caught red handed it will be next to impossible to find the guilty parties. I don't think the MNR has the resources to investigate.
992754,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 14:04:00,5558,The province definitely has enough resources to nail me driving 122 on 400 north 10 kilometers south of parry sound at 9pm on a thursday though.  I literally take this as mass murder and animal cruelty.
992760,Fisherman,2017-01-26 15:15:00,7201,"At minimum, all nets should be identifiable with a metal tag at both ends.  If not, they get removed and forfeited to the Crown for destruction."
992761,manitoubass2,2017-01-26 15:22:00,11391, A licensed tag identifying would no doubt help eliminate issues of such neglect and abuse of laws AND treaty rights(if this is involved)
992763,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 15:27:00,5558,AND treaty rights(if this is involved)  i tried to stay away from this...but the odds are definitely stacked against it. As always one bad apple spoils the bunch. I couldnt imagine the fury that those who work within their rights must feel when this ish happens.
992769,Korber,2017-01-26 16:15:00,79,Such Bull. Hope the get jail time and a proper sentence
992773,miami,2017-01-26 17:34:00,29,Tags - with your name/address etc are required if your trapping Bait Fish with a Bait trap. I was hassled once and threaten with a ticket. Didn't take me long to mark it.  Someone knows something. There should be a sizable reward for Tips to motivate people to report these Sub Humans.  I truly hope the law catches whoever is responsible and the perps are jailed big time.

992779,manitoubass2,2017-01-26 17:55:00,11391,"Not happy id imagine.  I mentiomed before, on our rez, youde be charged to the full extent of the law and banned from the rez via BCR(band council resolution)"
992794,Toronto_Angler,2017-01-26 21:37:00,698,The province definitely has enough resources to nail me driving 122 on 400 north 10 kilometers south of parry sound at 9pm on a thursday though.  I literally take this as mass murder and animal cruelty.  I have no issue with putting resources towards catching dangerous drivers. Those resources that caught you may be used to catch someone driving drunk and I am all for that!

992798,SirCranksalot,2017-01-26 21:51:00,3291, It seems weird to require your name and address on a minnow trap but not a gill net?  It's a fool's errand to try to make sense of some laws!!
992800,Big Cliff,2017-01-26 21:54:00,6899, It's a fool's errand to try to make sense of some laws!! And you can't drag a dead horse down Young Street on a Sunday (any other day of the week is fine). Yup last I heard it was still on the books!
992808,aplumma,2017-01-26 23:26:00,6896,"Down South here a gill net has length and hole size limits. The netter has to have a license and the start and end buoy has to have your Social Security number burned into the float as well as a name.address if you are going to be over 150 yards away from it. The net must be checked within 24 hours of each set. They are pretty strict and I get checked once or twice a year while netting gizzard shad for bait,  Art"
992823,Fisherman,2017-01-27 01:15:00,7201,Maybe it's time to rattle the MNR to get it implemented.
992837,adempsey,2017-01-27 03:32:00,1498,They should at least show the nets?
992840,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 03:42:00,11391,"You all know Im an advocate of treaty rights.  But im a bigger advocate for nature.  Ive called the MNR a few times for unattended/unmarked nets.  Give me a second and ill find pics of netted sturgeon left to die in +30 temps in 10"" of water.  Unexceptable NO MATTER WHAT  These fish, by my judgement, were there at least two days. Alive, but no way the survived revival"
992841,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 03:47:00,11391,  
992857,AKRISONER,2017-01-27 13:31:00,5558,     did you report this to the MNR? I think by your post above you did. We all have a duty to stop this garbage.  I was fishing in Severn for crappies last year and drove past the locks and sure enough theres a guy standing fishing right in the fish sanctuary. drive a bit further and his truck is literally parked in front of the sign posted at the trail head saying fish sanctuary no fishing. We took a photo of his license plate and called the MNR   MY concern is that nothing was done due to lack of resources. Oh and yes...100% the guy wasnt status he had the standard polish eagle on the back of his SUV.
992862,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 14:00:00,11391,Yes AKRI I called the MNR immediately  The guy was busted a few weeks later and got hammered in court  Turns out he had all sorts of fish and game violations and illegal weapons charges etc
992866,BillM,2017-01-27 14:06:00,17367,^--- Awesome.
992867,Oggie,2017-01-27 14:06:00,588,"I set nets for the MNR back in the 1970s and we had to mark them with a tag.  We often didn't put buoys on them because we were working in small remote lakes with no cottagers, in an effort to reduce theft of the nets. they were set at dark and pulled at 8 am.  If you're setting nets without identifying yourself then you're not subject to the laws of Ontario ie. status or a non-FN poacher. I would think most status Fn would identify their nets."
992870,SirCranksalot,2017-01-27 14:15:00,3291,Yes AKRI I called the MNR immediately  The guy was busted a few weeks later and got hammered in court  Turns out he had all sorts of fish and game violations and illegal weapons charges etc Really? The look like dogfish(small sharks). Where was the pic taken?
