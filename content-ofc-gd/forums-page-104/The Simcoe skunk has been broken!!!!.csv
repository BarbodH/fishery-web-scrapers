993107,NAW,2017-01-31 17:24:00,4022,"I am trying to remember the last time I caught a whitefish on Lake Simcoe.   It's been a long time!  I think it was the year that ice shelf broken off and floated out from shanty bay and all of the Fisherman had to be rescued.  That's a LONG time ago!!  Either way, I finally broke the skunk!  And man did it feel/taste good!  And to make it even better, I caught a laker about 45 minute later!  I only marked 8 fish all morning.  But I hoisted 2 of them. So that's a pretty good day in my books!  5lb 4 Oz each.  Both the exact same length!  Pretty neat..   My lucky Asian spot!  http://i.imgur.com/r1M47m5.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/14WnKPw.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/brriHCT.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/oQTKDDd.jpg  I can't get the direct photo link to work on my phone..."

Switched to a meegs on Sunday and that did the trick! Ok, I know, this is a really stupid question coming from me but I honestly have CRS (hey, at 71 it's not only allowed, it's expected). Where can I get some of these meegs jigs?  My son would love to get out for some white fish and lake trout and as strange as this might seem, I've only fished them once and that was with Sly (bless him) and Joey and Paul. Beans and I managed to get the opportunity and while we didn't catch any fish we couldn't have had better company or been better taken care of.  There is a couple of factors; I can't walk very far anymore (well I can but by the time I get there you'll probably be on your way home LOL). I sold or gave away most of my stuff, portable ice hut, ATV, sled.....  Now my son is no slouch, hunts, fishes, spent most of his life in the bush, he can fend for himself but experience is the key and when it comes to white fish and lake trout, neither of us have a lot of experience.  So, I am willing to rent a hut from Tim, and pay for three people if someone that Knows what they are doing will kind of act as our guide for a day and help me put my son on some fish!  Any takers?"
993126,Raf,2017-01-31 21:09:00,3495,"cliff, to be successful on simcoe for lakers and whitefish you need to be mobile.  sitting in a hut all day will net you limited success.  consider heading out with a guide who will work to put you on fish and keep you moving either on snowmobile or atv and in a portable hut.  PM me if you need a recommendation.  OFC User Meegs makes meegs jigs and I'd contact him first.  s"
993127,GBW,2017-01-31 21:16:00,8460,Meegs' ice jig's is a local to Simcoe and makes these Cliff.  Some dress the hook with a micro tube

993145,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-01 00:21:00,937,How much do meegs retail for?
993158,NAW,2017-02-01 02:03:00,4022,I got mine at the bait bucket in barrie for about $5.
993160,Gallie,2017-02-01 02:17:00,1215,5 buck each

993173,ketchenany,2017-02-01 12:30:00,3229,Do they still use the pearl setup for whitefish and trout? That was a given back in the 80s
993249,Acountdeleted,2017-02-02 12:57:00,2562,Way to go bud! Glad you were finally able to ice one of those tricky whitefish. Looks like a good meal coming up.
