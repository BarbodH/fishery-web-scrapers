891497,Sinker,2015-01-10 21:07:00,8692,"22lb laker. Scared the crap out of me. It was OOS though, by about 7 hours. Caught it fishing walleyes on new years eve at dusk, and laker season didnt open until midnight! Caught on a tip up with 10lb mono and handlined the whole way! I was only 15 when I caught it! Havent come close to topping it since!! A few high teens, but nothing over 20 since! It was my lucky day. I didnt even get a photo....  S."
891539,Musky or Specks,2015-01-10 23:50:00,2710,Came for the fish porn. Not disappointed
891542,Gallie,2015-01-11 00:13:00,1215,"Thats is a sweet ice gator! And some other beauty fish to boot. Good work fellas. My biggest through the ice was a 39"" pike on simcoe many many moons ago haha."
891566,chris.brock,2015-01-11 01:16:00,4053,"I remember the thread- ""yup, that's an 8"" hole"", looks like a Great Bear Lake laker but bigger  Curryale, that's a beauty, more of the story would be cool, bait? depth?"
891576,curryale,2015-01-11 02:30:00,26,"That guy was caught on my all time favorite splake bait - a jig and a minnow.  When things get slow for me on a I just yo-yo my bait 6 inches off the bottom.  The lake that we were fishing that day is shaped like a ""pot"". It drops off very quickly from shore around the entire circumference of the lake. That fish was taken in about 30 feet of water (which is unusually deep for me).  I thought for sure I had foul hooked a fish when I first got him on .... The teeth on him were pretty gnarly and when I asked my buddy to help me get him through the hold the answer was ""I am not sticking my hand in there""."
891585,Sinker,2015-01-11 03:41:00,8692,Haha....you need to tell your buddy to put down his purse!!!  I'd draw blood for anyone for a splake like that!!   S.
891587,Nipfisher,2015-01-11 04:12:00,2449,"Fishabout, it will look something like this.  http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r113/blairmandyalex/CIMG1634.jpg  http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r113/blairmandyalex/CIMG1636.jpg  http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r113/blairmandyalex/CIMG1637.jpg"
891589,FishAbout,2015-01-11 04:40:00,106,Is that a skin mount nipfisher? Nice looking mount. Mine is going to be a skin mount. Not the longest pike I have caught but largest through the ice.  I'm sure it had a lake trout in its gut.  I will take a picture of the mount post it on here once I get it back.
891603,bigugli,2015-01-11 13:28:00,6138," That is one beautiful pike. Don't see them that big down in Niagara. Best I've managed was 38"" northern."
891648,Steve,2015-01-11 19:35:00,2075,"bigugli, do you know 'Jaci'?  She is a native lady who fishes Jordan Harbour/Hamilton Harbour etc.  She has taken 2 pike over 40"" in the last couple years...photo's of both are floating around. one from each of the spots above.  She is the pike queen, lol."
891720,bigugli,2015-01-12 00:19:00,6138,"  Heard  of her, but never met. We hear of 40""+ pike every year coming out of L Ontario or L Erie"
891779,hookerdown,2015-01-12 12:10:00,110,"I caught what would have been the Ontario record Burbot, approximately 12 lbs, 39"" x 21"" caught on 4 lb test while fishing for perch on Lake Simcoe.  It was quickly released  "
891881,c10,2015-01-13 00:15:00,131,"I caught a 12.8 pound Walleye on BOQ when i was in grade 11, then less than ten minutes later my dad caught a 14.6 pound eye... Kind of stole my thunder! lol"

891221,manitoubass2,2015-01-09 02:11:00,11391,"Looking at the ""ice gators"" thread and it brings alot of excitement to me about my next pike outing on LOTW.  Pike are wicked fun through the ice, especially 35"" plus.  I didn't want to derail that thread so I thought I'd ask OFC what the biggest fish they caught through the ice were?  Bonus points for pics?  Here is a decent sturgeon incidentally caught at my Family Day walleye derby last year.  These were gnarly fights on walleye gear!!!  No measurement but definitely over 60""    I got a photo of a young fellow with a 55"" sturgeon somewhere as well. Boy was he happy? I'll have to see if I can locate it.  So, where are your pics/stories?"
891241,moxie,2015-01-09 03:22:00,1566,Quinte Walleye a few winters back weighed in at a hair shy of 11 Lbs.
891246,Locnar,2015-01-09 03:39:00,645,"A few rainbows. That's a 30"" rod. I'm still pretty new to the ice fishing game, and have spent most of my time getting crappies and jumbos. "
891248,reelinrolly,2015-01-09 03:50:00,281,"20lb plus carp about 10 years ago.  Didn't fight until it saw the hole, 45 minutes later, squeezed her through the hole!!!!   hahahaha"
891250,grizzlybri,2015-01-09 03:58:00,565,"wow a sturgeon through the ice, i think i would soil myself if i pulled that out of the whole. I'll hopefully post some pictures back in this thread sometime in the season"
891252,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 04:03:00,2562,"  This is only about my 4th year of ice fishing and I usually consider myself lucky if I catch anything. This 3 pound Burbot was my first fish on a tip up and it gave me a new appreciation for hand bombing fish. To date, its my biggest through the ice."
891254,ONbuckhunter,2015-01-09 04:06:00,39,14.4 lb walleye.  Quinte last year.  I've caught some lakers prob a bit heavier but never weighed them.  That's my most memorable ice fish.
891259,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-09 04:37:00,8243,"A 55 pound Bat Ray in the Keys. Ooops through the ice not ice in my drink. We didn't weigh it but I pulled a 38"" Northern through the hole on Nip many years ago. Last fish on a Sunday afternoon of 3 days, got me the 40 bucks for big fish. Never give up, might get you 40 bucks.  BTW, nice Burbot Jeremy84, keep it up. I've never caught one after 35 years fishing."
891275,BillM,2015-01-09 12:45:00,17367,This brute from last year.  Going to be tough to top!

891298,BillM,2015-01-09 14:44:00,17367,"We took a measurement with a fishing rod, right around 38 inches.  No girth measurements taken.  It also made the rounds at the local MNR office from what I've heard."
891301,manitoubass2,2015-01-09 15:02:00,11391,Wha??? Howah thats alot of grease!!!  Great fish
891305,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 15:15:00,2562,Bill....... That fish is a dream. I have a spot saved on my wall for a cast made of a fish like that (could never bring myself to keep a beauty like that) if I ever land one.  Thanks ironmaker. That's the only one I ever landed but I'm hoping to target a few more this winter.
891306,manitoubass2,2015-01-09 15:21:00,11391,"here is that youth angler with a thin and long sturgeon. Around the 50-55"" mark.  Sorry for the horrible pic, but this kid was stoked! He had never seen anything like it before  "
891307,curryale,2015-01-09 15:22:00,26,Not my biggest through the ice ever but this Splake in the 30 inch range came from a lake that is only about a quarter mile long.
