The number of people, mostly Black or Hispanic that are serving lengthy Federal sentences for possession with the purpose of trafficking in US Federal and State prisons is an utter disgrace. Some are serving life sentences in back water States.  Under the Ontario Health and Safety Act for Mines and Mining Plants employees that are taking any prescription drugs are responsible to report those drugs to management. A little know section of the Act that was hardly enforced during my days as both a Supervisor in a Mining Plant as well as my experience with the MOL. I'm sure it is still in the little green book."

992441,GbayGiant,2017-01-22 23:43:00,1780,"Good read for the Layman.   Yesterday, the largest ever coordinated attack on business owners was carried out by the Toronto Police Service. In an action reminiscent of Operation Soap – the violent invasion and shutdown of several LGBTQ businesses in 1981 – Project Claudia involved police laying siege to dozens of cannabis dispensaries in the GTA and stealing millions of dollars’ worth of inventory, crippling their ability to serve patients. Why did this happen? Who is to blame? I, and others, have covered the ‘why’ in articles on this site but, in this post, I’d like to focus on ‘whom.’ Ever since 2012, when the new MMPR was proposed, our industry has been in a fight for its very existence against a criminal organization that has managed to convince our government that they, despite having zero experience, know what’s best for patients, and the businesses that have been safely and successfully serving them for decades. In a post appearing in the Globe & Mail, a day after the assaults and robberies, Ms. Kostovic called the actions “long-awaited” and “welcome news for patients everywhere.” She claimed that risking liberty and property to faithfully serve patients with cannabis of far higher quality than LPs is “giving compassion a bad name” and that she, as a supposed patient herself, can’t possibly risk buying product from a dispensary. The real story here though is that Ms. Kostovic is the Director of Communications of GrowWise Health, a clinic designed to shovel patients in to the money-starved maw of LPs. These clinics will typically accept kickbacks from the ones they write medical documents for, or charge patients for one. A practice that physicians like Dr. Rob Kamermans are hypocritically being sued for. Mr. Levy is more prolific than Ms. Kostovic, but no different. He’s the co-founder of Canadian Cannabis Clinics, another medical document mill for the LPs. In an absolutely off-the-rails opinion piece in the Toronto Star, Levy cooks up as much fear pornography as he possibly can in order to cast doubt on dispensaries. Equating dispensary owners to drug pushers, he lauds LP’s for being “cleaner (tested for mould, viruses and pesticides), safer and cheaper than anything you can buy at a dispensary.” This is a common theme in LP-speak; their product is clean and tested, while you may as well be playing Russian roulette going to a dispensary. You’d think he’d be able to cite some actual evidence to prove his case. After all, Ronan is a lawyer and he ostensibly understands what the burden of proof is. He expects us to forget that LPs Tilray, Peace Naturals, and Whistler have all faced product recalls due to contamination and unsafe growing practices. Another early LP, Greenleaf Medicinals, shut down because growing a plant was too much for them to handle safely. LP product is also incapable of meeting the requirements for organic product certification due to the allowable pesticides under the MMPR, while most of what is sold in dispensaries does. These shills rely on lies and misinformation in order to disparage businesses that have been operating safely for over a decade. But it’s no accident that “BC Bud” is known all over the world. Dispensaries sell amazing, safe, high quality cannabis that LPs can’t match. Get over it. A popular software application across North America for finding local cannabis strains. The Canadian experience has been somewhat different though than our US counterparts. Leafly’s Canadian customers have repeatedly complained about the rates they charge, as well as the poor results they get in terms of their brand exposure. Dispensaries are consistently buried under a mountain of illegal LP advertising. Owned by Privateer Holdings, Leafly is but one of a portfolio of companies that chiefly includes the LP Tilray, and Tilray has been no friend to the dispensaries. If you’re using Leafly, then not only are you handing your data over to companies seeking to destroy and monopolize our industry, you’re also helping fund your own oppression. Don’t be a pawn in their game. This is the primary trade association and lobby group employed by the LPs. In a January 2016 press release, the group encouraged violence against dispensary owners and parroted the fear porn that so many of the LP shills are known for. Executive director Colette Rivet, spent her career up to this point working for organizations like the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse. These same organizations have spent decades marginalizing the medical utility of cannabis, contributing to the hysteria fueling violence, and stonewalling efforts to improve patient access to this important medicine. Their unscientific approach to cannabis, and repeated inflammatory and unsupported assertions about it, have only caused confusion and prevented evidence-based legislation from emerging. Cam Battley, chair of their advocacy committee said the assaults on Toronto dispensary owners were “a long time coming,” and that “we warned the municipal government last fall that things were getting out of hand.” With all the bad press surrounding LPs and their front groups it’s no surprise to see that new or rebranded front groups are constantly emerging. Launched in early 2016, this new group is proposing bringing back all the worst elements of the MMAR in order to satisfy Justice Phelan’s order from the Allard trial. In a document published on their website they recommend bringing back the PUPL and DPPL licenses (albeit under different names) under substantially the same rules. Caregivers would be able to produce for only four patients at a time and only 12 plants per patient. It’s no surprise that they would recommend a heavily restrictive, doomed-to-fail set of regulations in response to the ruling. For decades, patients have been suing the government for repeatedly violating their Charter rights, and with every success the government (deliberately?) botches their revisions. Why would they break tradition when it comes to the Allard ruling? In the Sfetkopoulous trial of 2008, the court ruled that the one-to-one producer/patient ratio imposed by the MMAR was unjustifiable. In response, the government raised it to two-to-one… gee, thanks. Now we’re supposed to accept a limit of four caregivers? Do these people really expect to be taken seriously? Apparently so because in early May, CTAC sent lobbyist Kate Dalgleish, who is also lobbying for CTAC federally, to the City of Toronto to lobby on their behalf on the issue of dispensaries. The CTAC website reveals very little about who they are and where they come from but the lobbyist registry identifies their head office as being in the HSBC building in downtown Vancouver. Take from that what you may. CTAC’s Executive Director, Rosy Mondin, is another lawyer and also the owner of Soma Labs, which performs extractions on organic compounds and provides R&D services for vitamins and nutritional supplements. What began as one of Canada’s first LPs (thanks primarily to their deep connections to the Liberal Party) has since grown in to a multi-headed hydra of industrial destruction and consumer disappointment. After renaming themselves to Canopy Growth Corporation, they acquired another LP by the name of Bedrocan who proudly produces gamma-irradiated product. Tweed’s CEO, Bruce Linton, has a long history of anti-dispensary statements and one doesn’t have to do much digging to find them. More interestingly though is the financial story behind this firm. As one of the first publicly-traded LPs, they have to consistently make their financial statements available to the public. To an educated eye, the company is an unmitigated disaster. The company’s cash flow statement is completely upside down with investor money coming in, then going out on operations. Somewhere along the line I think Canopy’s executives forgot that the whole point of a company was to have the money moving in the other direction. At their current cash burn rate, they only have enough funds in the bank to last another year or so, two at most. Canopy is definitely feeling the heat, and their failure will be a spectacular one if they can’t find a way to a positive operational cash flow. How much more dilution will their owners be willing to take before the stock completely crashes? Over $137 million has been sunk in to the company thus far and still no signs of positive returns. Another of the first LPs to receive a license, Tilray has long attracted the ire of the cannabis community due to their deeply troubling actions and statements against dispensaries. Even Kirk Tousaw has remarked that their marketing strategy hinges on liberally insulting home-growers and casting aspersions upon dispensaries. They retained Ginny Movat, of Crestview Strategy, to lobby the City of Toronto on their behalf. A seasoned political operative, who has worked for both the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as well as the Ontario PC Party, Ginny has had extensive communications with Toronto council members, staff and City employees beginning Feb. 24 of this year. Most notably with councillor Joe Cressy, advocating for a “strong, well-regulated medical cannabis system.” For LPs, a well-regulated system is one that ensures their cartel can operate unchallenged and continue to extract monopoly profits from distressed patients. As mentioned before, they’re also using their cannabis app Leafly so that the industry hands them not only the rope, but the money to hang dispensary owners with. When animals are backed in to a corner, they become violent and unpredictable. We’re witnessing the same behaviour from the licensed producers, their front organizations and shills. As the failure of LPs becomes more and more evident, expect these cries of frustration to only get louder. We aren’t dealing with respectable businesspeople who face their competition honourably, and with deference to their ultimate authority, consumers. We’re dealing with a criminal organization that has co-opted our government because it’s easier (and legal) to have police be your hired thugs. They think that it’s not only possible, but preferable, for governments to strip away the rights of their citizens in order to guarantee their profit margins. They think that spreading fear, hate and violence is the way to win market share. Don’t let them. If you care about this industry, and the patients who depend on it, then you must take action. Medical or recreational, we all have something at stake and it’s no longer acceptable to be sitting on the sidelines. When those four bath houses were raided in 1981, thousands took to the streets and it was not pretty. There were riots, hunger strikes, and repeated action until the affected people got what they wanted. It’s time for us to do the same and, when we’re done, politicians should be quaking in their boots at the prospect of the cannabis vote coming down on their heads like a guillotine. Boycott all LPs, their associates and front organizations. Encourage people to do the same. Join the Cannabis Growers of Canada, the only national group representing the true interests of the cannabis industry. As the great US statesman Frederik Douglass once said; “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” It’s time our demands were heard."
992447,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-23 03:15:00,8243,"Maybe you didn't get the memo GBayGiant.  Before it does get locked I have to tell you something I saw last week. I was in the east end of Hamilton the other day. On my way to get to my appointment I walked past one of the dispensaries. I back tracked and walked in. It is nothing but a head shop, dirty, grungy, music blaring and the people that were in there would not be the folks on my Christmas card list. They were each and everyone stoned out of their gourds. Not 1 was over 30 and I don't have X-Ray vision so I couldn't tell what chronic pain they had. I know they weren't feeling much pain at all. I bet they thought I was a Cop. They all froze when I walked in.  If these dispensaries are all the same they are a joke. More than one doper I know that grows their own and sells it drove several miles to get their script. Makes it easier doing business.  De criminalize, yes, legalize, not yet."
992459,GbayGiant,2017-01-23 12:07:00,1780,Well Sir. .its that or you can buy poison off of the new Government set up Large producers who ALL spray their medications? with poison. Because they are allowed because they think it is safe..In order for them to produce a crop. Sick people can grow their own for themselves and they certainly do not need anything  sprayed on their meds. This is the point of the post. Recreational is different? That's where these Large Produces are going. They plan on poisoning people for profit. Soon ANYONE will be able to grow their own with our new laws coming.  LP's knowingly poison people.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  in spite of what you may have seen in a shop that probably caters to 1000's of different of people a day because they feel actually safer buying like they have for the last ...60 years? Rather than buying from government appointed poison producer (  ) like they TRIED to force the sick people into doing but they won in court  thankfully and can do for themselves. now Soon Recreational will be able to grow as well in their back yard.  Sorry for the smell but some people don't like the small of fish...but hey...  try and not let it bother you any . As much as you think and feel that it is about getting high..its about staying alive for some. Your attitude won't let you see that no matter how much it really helps others.
992467,lookinforwalleye,2017-01-23 13:31:00,4399,I think GB nailed it.....My son uses a dispensary for products he uses Cannabis as a way to help with anxiety and also to combat the  side effects of the drugs he takes for his very serious illness...I don`t consider my son a stoner I consider him a brave young man for battling something that struck him in the prime of his life....stoner no sir!!!

It may not be much easier to grow your own after legalization than it is now."

978986,Steve,2016-08-09 22:32:00,2075,"considering the UN is declassifying Cannabis as a drug, that shouldn't be an issue.  legalizing pot does not remove Canada's classification as a drug free country.  eat it. grow it. smoke it. buy it.  and here's a crazy idea....enjoy it.  it doesn't have to be medicine."
979035,jedimaster,2016-08-10 13:47:00,3472,"You know Steve, That view point is probably the first time I have hear anyone outright say something useful. If you want it and support it for recreationally use than go ahead and say so. Makes no difference to me if people get high. Having dealt with situations where people in my life needed it for medical use I find it very offensive when people put up an argument saying it should be legalized recreationally because its good for you or is needed for medical use or helps my third cousins brothers wife with her cancer. It already is and has been for a long time available and legal for medical use. Really who cares if someone smokes a joint after work or whatever. Just don't wrap the two arguments in one because recreational pot use has nothing to do with the medical benefits for pain killing and easing someone going through physical trauma.  It just doesn't jive to me when someone that has no medical need for it use medical use as a reason for them to be allowed to smoke pot.     If I had to guess what the legislation would be I would think along these lines.  1) Further ease up the access to grow for people with medical need. Perhaps a growing license of sorts. 2) Allow the sale of prepared pot treats (Brownies and such) for recreational use to be sold at XYZ retails/licensed places. Perhaps something similar to LCBO licensing. 3) Decriminalize the use of pot for recreation use 4) Stiffer fines for supplying Minors  I don't think that they will legalize the sale of marijuana in its raw form because as they have said a number of times they want to control and be able to tell people THC levels and that is very hard to do and would be cost prohibitive as individual leaves let alone plant to plant or crop to crop can vary greatly in THC levels. This is one of the battles and issues they had in the US when legalizing.  I mean I would liken it to going to buy alcohol without having percentages on the bottles. Its going to be controlled to some degree and likely they will take along brush strokes and try and span this out over several campaigns. With the economy going to sh1t under this gov they know it will be a dog fight to get in next time, stretching out a plan to legalize over the course of several terms is something that sounds like what they would do.  I doubt very much they will just black and white say pots legal its a free for all."
979076,Dutch01,2016-08-10 20:09:00,1431,"Jedi, you make a number of good points here. I'm a recreational user, I make no claim to have a medical need. I do agree some people use medical marijuana as an excuse for recreational use.  Initially, when there really was no medical access, it was a legitimate cause. The legalization lobby saw this as a foot in the door and jumped on board. This worked for them, and medical access softened a lot of people's opinion on the issue. I never got a license because I believe that would  be conceding a choice to the government that I believe is mine alone to make. I don't accept that anyone else has the right to tell me I can't use weed, just as I don't have the right to tell them what to eat or drink (or smoke). So in the end I agree with you that people who want to smoke recreationally should just say so.  I think there is no question flowers (dried marijuana) will be legalized. It's the easiest to prepare and most commonly used form of cannabis.  I don't think THC content labeling will be required, but it will be easily accomplished if so.  Mass Spectrometer testing would be feasible imo, and will only get cheaper as demand increases. Consider that the first time a human DNA genome was sequenced for a private individual it cost him $3 billion. Now it can be done for $3 thousand. The idea of spending $50 to test the thc content in a pound of weed that will sell for perhaps $3,000 or more retail would not be an undue hardship.  I think they will actually be tougher on edibles.  I have some first hand experience with them and find dosage much more difficult to manage. I think they should focus on dosage control by limiting the maximum size of one serving to an industry agreed upon single dose size. For example, one cookie, candy or chocolate can only have up to 50mg of THC (I picked a random number, I'm not sure what it should actually be). If the user wants a higher dose, they can't buy a stronger or bigger cookie, they just have to eat two. This way a consumer can have some confidence that if they only eat one dose of any edible, they're not going to get royally messed up.  As for growing, they will likely be forced by the Supreme Court to allow growing for medical users.  Since recreational legalization is voluntary by the liberals and not likely to be seen as a right to access issue by the Supreme Court, I do not see them allowing me to grow my own. I could easily grow a year's supply of top notch stuff for a couple bucks (after the initial equipment outlay). They'll never make tax revenue off that, so I don't see it happening.  You're probably right, it's not going to be a free-for-all, no matter what it looks like."

In the legal states, i believe every single one has this same regulation implemented. To be honest its a total relief as past experience with homemade edibles 1. tasted terrible, and two were insanely potent to the point that half of a cookie had me on the verge of being uncomfortable.  I am certainly a very occaisional recreational user but am also a firm believer that too many people abuse substances including the herb, and thus like anything people will use its inherited positive aspects as a method of promoting its use. I think this is beyond stupid.  I would never ever promote the usage of weed to anyone unless in a medicinal sense. If you are a cancer patient, epileptic etc. The whole legalization movement though just seems like a bunch of chronic abusers looking for an excuse to get high. Its not much different than people going around saying everyone should eat mcdonalds all the time cause it tastes good.  Call a spade a spade. Let the people have their medicine that need it...my 90 year old grandmother was prescribed THC while undegoing chemo, Wake up folks the medical industry is already able to supply the stuff to the majority of people that need it. Dont give us a s0b (why is s0b being autocorrected...dude is a word lol i dont mean s-o) story because you are a pot head that needs to abuse weed to feel better about yourself.  regulate it so that children cant buy it, allow businesses to have success properly growing and managing it, dont hand it over to a lobby and government regulated monopoly, take the power out of the hands of organized crime, allow our police officers to spend more time and resources catching real criminals, and tax it so that we can build some schools and hospitals like they are doing in colorado and washington.

To the guy that grows a single plant in his window, No. To the person that decides to grow 10 or 20 plants in his basement under high humidity and Metal Halides? Yes. Just google ""Pot Grow op Fire"". Houses, apartments, condos etc... burn down every year because of these grow ops. Why would there need to be legislation? To limit the effects of things getting out of control. Personal one person one plant use type things... Yah not sure a big deal. To have a blanket statement like growing cannabis is not dangerous is just smoking out the side of your mouth.  I'm neither for not against the legalization, however I am very much for sensible legislation and control not unlike sensible legislation and control of firearms, tobacco and alcohol. Laws aren't generally put in place to protect the public from responsible people. Its to help protect the unsensible people from themselves and everyone around them.  On on hand you can view this as a reason to not legalize it and on another you can see this as a reason to legalize it. I'm not saying either one is better than the other just that I think your statement is a bit one sided, agenda driven and doesn't see the full picture. I mean if legislation gets put in place and allows people to grow safely maybe it cuts down on the illegal pot grow ops and actually has some benefit in that regard. Wouldn't that be great.   you are very wrong with your thinking. You should read the Judges MMJ decision on growing. Not the people who lied about how dangerous it is due to ulterior motives. but again. You do not know. Most have no clue and listen to things that just aren't true. Only because it doesn't matter to them which is understandable.  here...you can read all about it and   find that what you have said is completely wrong.  http://cas-cdc-www02.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/T-2030-13%20reasons%2024-02-2016%20(ENG).pdf  Ill make it easier   To all leadership and members of the Cannabis Rights Coalition In the wake of Allard the Coalition has been working diligently in the back ground to prepare for what may arise from Allard. Moreover, the Coalition has strong reasons to believe the federal government of Canada will “heavily restrict plant counts” as with how and where one can cultivate marihuana. We all need recognize that in Allard we only proved no “public safety” existed with respect to home cultivation the judge did not address what was reasonable with respect to growing only that we can continue as no public safety was established by Canada during the Allard trial. The fundamental Right to autonomy is an international Right that in essence allows any free civilian to put into their bodies whatever they wish provided that they are not hurting themselves or others “the public” in the process of exercising their Right to autonomy. The federal government of Canada in concert with the heads of various departments of government RCMP, Fire Chiefs, and Health Canada all stood on the national stage in 2012 and sold to Canadian civilians that organized crime, fire, and mold were problems that plague the then federal marihuana program known as the Medical Marihuana Access Division (MMAD) and governing Medical Marihuana Access Regulations (MMAR). You see to remove the right to grow marihuana for personal use is very much an issue of autonomy when we look at the safety, non addictive nature of marihuana as with the fact there is no lethal death dose in relation to any form of marihuana use it becomes more clear why those said officials stood and lied to the public of Canada sighting organized crime, fire, and mold as “public safety” concerns thus opening the door to “strip our Right to autonomy” sighting us marihuana growers were a threat to the general public and ourselves. The judge in Allard agreed that Canada the defendant failed to substantiate claims of organized crime as with claims of fire with respect to the 34,000 growers and their gardens. In fact, before trial the Coalition secured a $70,000 federal Injunction that was appealed by Canada. They failed under appeal to show any public safety concerns to home gardens. So when we look at justice Manson who first approved the Injunction on March 21st 2014 coupled with the three federal judges on the appeals bench who unanimously agreed with justice Manson that no public safety excised. So this leaves us with four federal judges who agreed with our position of no public safety. The Coalition took Canada to trial using only $300,000 raised to fight while Canada spent 1.2-million-dollar’s in defence of their beloved (MMPR). Justice Phelan who presided over the Allard trial came back with a blistering and damaging blow to the defendant Canada and their MMPR scheme. First off the judge found that Canada’s experts in organized crime did not prove a single conviction of a medical marihuana grower let alone organized medical patients to support “organized crime”. In addition, justice Phelan noted the expert fire Chief for Canada could not demonstrate a single fire attributed to a medical marihuana legal garden. The government of Canada waged war on the medical growers of Canada via bad unconstitutional policy known as the MMPR failed to support their claim so horribly that justice Phelan decided compensation for some costs be granted for the plaintiffs. This compassionate judge’s stance in his decision is as historic as the Allard trial itself. Who has ever put Canada on trial, with a “restraining order” in place known as an Injunction then won in trial to the extent that, first the trial went “uncontested” and second the plaintiffs were “awarded costs”. This sets me to the next point of contention out there that suggests that Allard is fully funded or that anyone is getting any funds. The reality is as the client in the Allard matter I can assure all accounting and costs. Our challenge is over $750,000+ billed however we only raised $300,000 leaving our legal team with allot of unpaid bills. We also need take into account that a hearing must be held with the attorneys to see if compensation will in fact be awarded to the plaintiffs and if so how much? So as we move forward and rumours of Allard being funded and all is well is farthest from the truth. Were in fact paying off Allard while preparing for any legislation arising from Allard that we may wish challenge. If Health Canada was hypothetically to cap our plant counts at some unreasonable number say between 6-25 X number of plants only allowed to grow a certain height with a square foot space restriction. We have many in the culture acting finally to address the MMPR many helped usher in. The focus must remain on frontline service for the end user as with personal home cultivation. The Cannabis Rights Coalition will be touring nationally to celebrate the win in Allard that protected growing in Canada. In addition, the Allard uncontested win has set precedence for legalization with the option to personally grow. Thanks to the brave patients who fought with disability checks and supporters who collectively took out that threat of a model to legalization without plants as Justin and the Liberals had planned. Now Canada will always be able to grow for Allard was a Constitutional challenge that was won uncontested thus the right to grow marihuana in Canada can never be taken or attempt to be taken again. They will try and restrict this Right, this said we have a lot of time to address how legalization will look in Canada. In closing come join the Cannabis Rights Coalitionhttp://cannabisrightscoalition.ca and get involved with the organization who has and will continue to protect the rights of those persons who choose to use cannabis as a treatment or therapy. Together we can continue to make history, and remember time tells all truths. In the past five years of the MMPR this Coalition has been fighting for your rights via Injunction, Allard trail, and Privacy lawsuits filed while others ushered un the MMPR and chanted vote liberals the Coalition remained reserved with respect to their agenda. Expect to hear allot more from the Coalition as the feds close in on legislating Allard."
976674,BucktownAngler,2016-07-15 20:24:00,582," A few basic propositions for the legalization task force to consider. 1. Consuming cannabis is not deviant behaviour. It is normal and people that do so are not criminals, addicts, ""pot-heads"" or otherwise different from people that don't. 2. Growing cannabis is not dangerous. It's a plant, not nuclear material. 3. Cannabis has a huge and growing culture that is much like wine culture - we love the different smells, tastes and effects. We like to talk about it, share it, have fun with it. These things should be celebrated, not marginalized. 4. Cannabis is dramatically safer than alcohol and tobacco and there are simply no logical reasons why access to it should be restricted any more than those substances. In fact, to the extent that cannabis use replaces or decreases alcohol and tobacco use, it should be encouraged as a public health good. There is a public health argument that cannabis should be easier to access because it is safer.   they wont consider your post on OFC  take the time to fill out the survey online  http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/health-system-systeme-sante/consultations/legalization-marijuana-legalisation/index-eng.php"

Personally I don't care. if they do allow it would be prudent to come up with sensible legislation on indoor grow ops. What is sensible legislation? I dunno. Perhaps a max of 1000 watts of lighting allowed, perhaps restricting the number of plants, perhaps don't allow it to grow indoors at all and setup public grow houses like they already have for public gardens and charge people a few or something like. that where the location can be secured from kids, crooks and where its all wired up properly. I really don't know. All I said is sensible legislation is not entirely a bad thing.

976684,GbayGiant,2016-07-15 22:42:00,1780,"A few more propositions for the legalization task force: 1. People that grow cannabis now, lawfully and unlawfully, are not deviants, anti-social, criminogenic, immoral or otherwise worth of any derision simply because they grow cannabis. Many are passionate lovers of the plant and their love and hard work is worthy of praise much as we'd praise any artisan devoted to their craft. 2. People that sell cannabis now, lawfully and unlawfully, are exactly the same. The act of growing or selling cannabis is not morally blameworthy in and of itself and should not be the basis for any current or future discrimination. That a bad law has persisted for decades despite the widespread harm it causes is not the fault of those who persevered in spite of that bad law - the fault lies elsewhere. 3. People that grow, sell, process and work with cannabis now, lawfully and unlawfully, are developing expertise in those endeavours. Legacy producers and distributors (whom of necessity will have mostly been unlawful) are experts in those tasks - they are a valuable resource. They are a necessary component of any successful future. 4. Seen properly, the culture of cannabis is a social good, a positive thing, a way for free people to interact, express themselves creatively, to be entrepreneurs and innovators, to bring pleasure to themselves and to others. Condemning, implicitly or explicitly, cannabis culture by, for example, banning places of social consumption, overly restricting branding and marketing or discouraging cannabis tourism is wrong. It would be akin to a government campaign designed to demonize or diminish Canada's vibrant vineyard and wine industry, or its burgeoning craft beer culture, or even it's fantastic outdoor sports and recreation opportunities."

Honestly to those that need it for legitimate reasons its a bit of a disgrace to hear potheads use that as an excuse for smoking it and casts a bad light on those that do need it. Sure if you have a use for it all the power to you and it's unfortunate that your affliction is there and you need it but yes it should be and currently IS available to you if you go through the right channels.  If you actually read some of my posts I am all for medical use. Not to mention I have said a number of times I don't really care one way or another if someone uses it recreationally. However just like any other mind altering substance that is legalized(well alcohol being the only other one) there should be some controls on it to ensure the publics safety from those that abuse and are stupid about it. The people that want a buzz and eat a pot brownie while being responsible, who cares. Those that make a nuisance of themselves are the ones that will be determining how heavy restrictions are that are put in place for others.  For example the smell of someone's backyard crop invading there neighbors is an issue. There is a licensed grow house in markham by the food bank where my kids volunteer. Some days the smell is brutal strong. To the point where volunteers go home. Yes, yes, I know, I know, some people like the smell of pot, good for them. But for many many others it is a nuisance. So some sort of legislation to prevent some people from annoying others isn't a bad thing. Just like I'm sure you wouldn't want your neighbor playing Britney Spears all night long and I'm sure you would complain about that. Smell violations might be one of those things included perhaps by limiting ones crop size, where or how it may or may not be grown. Who knows. It will be interesting to see what this group comes up with as far as legislation."

A Harvard study from 2007 which remains the most comprehensive ever released on THC’s potential to combat tumors found that in just three weeks doses of THC were able to cut lung cancer tumor growth in half in mice subjects, and were able to reduce cancer lesions by even more. For the study, Harvard researchers tested THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is found naturally in cannabis) on cancer cells in labs, and followed that up by studying mice subjects. The lab demonstration found that doses of THC inhibited growth and spread in the cancer cells; “When the cells are pretreated with THC, they have less EGFR stimulated invasion as measured by various in-vitro assays,” states Anju Preet, PhD, who was one of the researchers for the study. Following the lab test, researchers dosed mice – which were implanted with human lung cancer cells – with THC, and found that in just three weeks, tumors were reduced in both size and weight by roughly 50% compared to a control group. According to Preet, cancer lesions on the lungs were also reduced – by nearly 60% – and there was as a significant reduction in “protein markers” associated with cancer progression. Researchers predict that THC had such a positive effect on combating tumors because it activates molecules that arrest the cell cycle, and may also interfere with the processes of angiogenesis and vascularization, which lead to cancer growth. Over 6 years since its original release, this study remains one of the most important cannabis-related studies ever released.

Cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemicals, including many of the same carcinogens as tobacco smoke.[34] A 2012 special report by the British Lung Foundation concluded that cannabis smoking was linked to many adverse effects, including bronchitis and lung cancer.[35] They identified cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also said awareness of the danger was low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users. They said there was an increased risk from each cannabis cigarette due to drawing in large puffs of smoke and holding them.[35] Marijuana smoke has been listed on the California Proposition 65 warning list as a carcinogen since 2009, but leaves and pure THC are not.[36]   love the comments from people who know very little."
978974,jedimaster,2016-08-09 20:54:00,3472,Its going to be very interesting to see what the legislation comes down to. Will they only legalize the sale of edibles produced by licensed companies? Will the take the reins completely off? Will pot be sold in smokeable form? Will people be allowed to grow there own? How are they intending on dealing with pot in schools? What about prior criminal records? What about people currently in jail? What about people previously fined? I mean there are a lot details to be worked out. Not to mention the UN treaties that were signed in good faith by canada to be a drug free country.

They've got this stuff figured out perfectly. Shop location in a perfectly nice neighborhood, totally unassuming, Windows were postered over with graphics as to not advertise the product to children and the like...  walk in, get ID'd immediately by a nice gentleman. Get to the counter, the selection of products is incredible and the enterpreneur behind the counter is about as nice of a retail sales associate as youd ever meet (good luck with this at the LCBO) Guy explains all of his products, provides us with information about the THC levels in all of the products. Ensures that we are getting product that wont render us useless/anxious/tired we select a few packaged edible selections which were absolutely delicious and once again totally unnasuming. By packaged, i mean the cookies looked like Mrs. fields with a logo and everything. I was notified that the local ""famous bakery"" is actually the supplier! He says ""not many people know this lol"" Complete the transaction and consume.  Everything neat, proper, legal and better than any LCBO experience I have ever had. The product was exactly as he described, we relaxed, rode a ferris wheel, ate some street eats, had a ginger beer, shared a lot of laughs and went to bed. Woke up the next day feeling 100% normal.  Tell me why this needs to be so strictly regulated again and controlled?

I'm neither for not against the legalization, however I am very much for sensible legislation and control not unlike sensible legislation and control of firearms, tobacco and alcohol. Laws aren't generally put in place to protect the public from responsible people. Its to help protect the unsensible people from themselves and everyone around them.  On on hand you can view this as a reason to not legalize it and on another you can see this as a reason to legalize it. I'm not saying either one is better than the other just that I think your statement is a bit one sided, agenda driven and doesn't see the full picture.

Contrary to popular belief, your taxes only pay for 50% of the costs associated with your Blue Box recycling, industry brand owners i.e. coca cola and walmart pay for the other half (soon to be 100%)  I can tell you right now, that unless your liquor bottle gets picked up by a garbage picker, it is ending up in a big pile of glass and that deposit is lost forever.  whats more of a joke is that the beer store (a government protected monopoly) does not have to pay any of the recycling costs associated with the glass that they put into the market.  This means that companys that produce glass packaging are picking up the beer stores bill on their behalf simply because a lobby got them exempt from the waste diversion acts product stewardship section.  Also contrary to popular belief, glass is not very recyclable at all. In fact its one of the crappiest recycling commodities of all. It is really rough on sorting machinery and destroys concrete floors inside of the recycling facilities.  Put it this way, you might think that everyone takes their empties back, but i can assure you that 90% of people that live in the city without a car (a huge portion of ontario's population) does not return their empties. On last check return rates are somewhere in the 70% range. 30% is ending up in the trash or going in the blue bin or simply being broken."

Example We do a lot of shipping and the shipping bills come with a fuel surcharge. I do not just charge for shipping and eat the fuel surcharge. I bill for it and also put a markup on it.  If there is an environmental charge, it gets marked up and charged for. The customer pays it, not the company. And we make a profit on it.  If these charges get too high, people will stop buying the product, (if at all possible, can't do that with electricity).

Buy the fancy package and pay to recycle it, or go to the company that uses a paper bag and pay a bunch less in recycling charges. Don't hide all the charges in legislation forcing the company to pay and we don't see it to make our own choices When a company starts losing sales because of excessive packaging, then they will change, not when the government makes them pay a fee and they just pass it on and nobody knows why prices went up"

972011,AKRISONER,2016-06-01 15:52:00,5558,"No, it shouldn't fall to taxpayers. Example We all pay for curbside recycling no matter how much we put in.  If you buy a case of bottled water and its $05 a bottle on top of the listed price, you have a choice to drink tap water or pay to recycle the bottle.  Darn...then we need another law to recycle the bottle instead of just chucking it since you already paid extra   The whole purpose here is to develop a ""circular economy""  Extended Producer responsibility is the name of the game. if you are coke, you make packaging and pay an associated fee for said packaging. You need to understand that in capitalism, the customer always pays...  The point here is that if there is a levy on packaging, companies always compete to have the lowest pricing. So if packaging becomes excessive and expensive, then the product subsequently becomes expensive and you end up not being competitive.  In the same point, the materials that are being recycled are now owned by the producers. there is incentive for them to have their HDPE or LDPE bottles recycled, so that they can buy the bails send them back to their plastic factory and make them into bottles all over again. The Producer now has control of the entire stream and it is more cost effective than using virgin materials.  There is still the limitation of what the end user decides to do with a product, especially when it comes to things like hazardous waste. Its your choice to return something like oil to a designated drop off zone funded 100% by industry (Hazardous waste is 100% extended producer responsibility) or to simply dump your used motor oil down the drain.  Thank god that majority of people are starting to realize that the environment is something that we need to keep an eye out for so that our future generations will have something left to enjoy."

I personally have to say that I am not a huge fan of these unregulated dispensaries that are shady at best.  I am 100% pro legalization, but it needs to be taxed properly and so do the organizations that are profiting from it. As it currently stands you have a whole pile of dispensaries that are attaining product from criminal organizations, and subsequently are not paying a dime of tax on the product they are selling.  And please dont come to me with the argument that these companies are ""paying taxes"" Considering I was in a dispensary last week with a friend who purchased the product ""cash only"" these businesses are not clean what so ever."

971905,GbayGiant,2016-05-31 14:56:00,1780,"Beverly Fox, who suffers from severe arthritis and an eye condition similar to glaucoma, puffs on a pipe filled with marijuana. (AP/Elaine Thompson) As the U.S. becomes more comfortable with the end of cannabis prohibition, many of the arguments sustaining the drug war will come to be acknowledged as being the ridiculouspropaganda that they were. For example, the lie about marijuana being the gateway drug that sends a person spiraling down the path of hard drug use and criminal activity is being completely overthrown as even recreational legalization is simply not causing these problems. Now we see another interesting phenomenon in regards to the legalization of medical marijuana. In California, where many opponents of legalization have insisted that lawful cannabis would cause the greatest spike in herb use among the state’s young people, quite the opposite is proving true, as citizens over the age of 55 are now the fastest growing demographic of pot users. The 55-and-older crowd is now the fastest-growing demographic of pot users in the country. Between 2013 and 2014, the number increased from 2.8 million to 4.3 million. [Source] Although they account for only 14% of the US population, seniors age 55 and up account for some 30% of the nation’s prescription drug use. Many of the medicines being consumed by seniors are highly addictive painkillers with seriously detrimental  side effects well known to the government and the pharmaceutical industry. As truthful knowledge of the plant’s genuine medical benefits spread, more and more seniors are turning to cannabis for assistance with the many medical complications associated with aging. As CBS New reports, Steve DeAngelo, owner of Harborside Medical Dispensary in Oakland, has been actively promoting cannabis to seniors, with great effect, as many of his customers now are in this demographic. His intentions for promoting to this age group are actually two-fold, however; firstly to help them find healthy alternatives to dangerous to pharmaceutical drugs, and secondly because those in this age group are typically the most outspoken advocates of prohibition. There’s [an] ironic, almost tragic phenomenon, which is that seniors, who are one of the groups who can most benefit from use of cannabis, are the single group which remains most opposed to reforming cannabis laws. – Steven DeAngelo As with any medicine, cannabis is not without its drawbacks or risks, but legalization makes it possible for people to draw their own conclusions and make their own decisions regarding which medicines they use to care for themselves."

Do you have any evidence to support your claim that there has been a five fold increase in pot use amongst youth in the last 25 years?  It certainly was not uncommon for youth to smoke pot in the '80s.  From what I understand it was even more common in the '70s.  I doubt that pot use is significantly higher now than it has been over the last forty or so years.  I wouldn't be surprised if it has dropped a little.

Anyone who will do that is already doing it now.  Secondly, you are wrong about tobacco being equally as damaging as pot.  Dr. Donald Tashkin, professor of medicine at UCLA oversaw the largest and longest longitudinal study of its kind.  That study concluded that rates of lung cancer did not increase, even with moderate use over long periods of time. You can read more about Tashkin's work here if you're into facts:  http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/annalsats.201212-127fr#.Vs8l80XEjCQ  Excerpt (I had to use OCR text recognition, please forgive any typos):  Regular smoking of marijuana by itself causes visible and microscopic injury to the large airways that is consistently associated with an increased likelihood of symptoms of chronic bronchitis that subside after cessation of use. On the other hand, habitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function when assessed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, except for possible increases in lung volumes and modest increases in airway resistance of unclear clinical significance. Therefore, no clear link to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been established. Although marijuana smoke contains a number of carcinogens and cocarcinogens, findings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk for the development of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use, although evidence is mixed concerning possible carcinogenic risks of heavy, long-term use. Although regular marijuana smoking leads to bronchial epithelial ciliary loss and impairs the microbicidal function of alveolar macrophages, evidence is inconclusive regarding possible associated risks for lower respiratory tract infection. Several case reports have implicated marijuana smoking as an etiologic factor in pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum and bullous lung disease, although evidence of a possible causal link from epidemiologic studies is lacking. In summary, the accumulated weight of evidence implies far lower risks for pulmonary complications of even regular heavy use of marijuana compared with the grave pulmonary consequences of tobacco.  Can you provide a link to any of the studies you have read? I would like to review them further.  Thanks.  Dutch"

Smoking a joint isn't in any way a controlled amount. It depends on a gazzilion variables.  How do you know how much THC to take to control the symptoms?  Lets face it we're legalizing marijuana for the same reasons we legalized gambling, alcohol, prostitution etc.  The masses want it legalized and criminal enforcement hasn't worked. So lets tax the crap out of it and move on! LOL"
959636,manitoubass2,2016-02-25 17:35:00,11391,"Marijuana smoke, suggested by studies, the cannabinoids somehow negate negative effects on lung tissue and cancer cell growth.  Although on paper, it contains roùghly 50% more tar than tobbacco, in comparison, marijuana smokers smoke far less than tobacco users.  Marijuana use shows no signs of increasing cancer nor does it effect the pulmonary system.  It can cause temporary bronchitus that regulates itelf upon quitting, or temporary COPD."
959638,Dutch01,2016-02-25 17:43:00,1431,"Any smoke has carcinogenic properties, so I understand where you are coming from.  In studies done with rats, when their endocannabinoid system was blocked they developed massive tumors.  The study authors inferred that the interaction of cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system protects against the formation of tumors.  While there is a dearth of research on the subject due to class 1 scheduling in the US, there is certainly evidence that marijuana may play a role in treating cancer (beyond the already noted value of increasing appetite/relieving nausea on chemotherapy patients).  If any other substance was discovered to have these properties it would be hailed as a huge breakthrough.  However, because governments are invested in prohibition and incarceration, and marijuana cannot be patented, there has been a long history of resistance to even exploring its medical value."
959641,manitoubass2,2016-02-25 17:53:00,11391,"Absolutely.  Also of note, blocking the endocannabinoid system doesnt just cause tumours, it caused cancerous tumours in the liver"

Not young people but upper-middle class housewives and retirees gathering together in groups chatting about their fancy dogs and getting buzzed on weed. It stinks and is somewhat offensive to my 13 yr. old. Sometimes see her teachers back there with dogs puffing.  Tinctures and digestible cannabis oils  (not smoked) have saved lives of some people i know with cancer. Even effective for my post surgery back pain and ravages of my severe multiple sclerosis. Hopefully Shoppers Drug Mart and government can get it right. Smoking weed isn't beneficial but tinctures, oils if medically supervised are better than all these Oxy-opiates."

However, if you get a lawyer, and fill out your forms correctly, they won't deny your waiver application.  The person you are referring to either used a ""non laywer' (ie, Canadian Pardon Services), or tried on their own.  My waiver cost me about $1,200 from the lawyer and another $800 for the waiver.

959180,Steve,2016-02-24 00:03:00,2075,"depends on if your running a hydroponic setup, using cubes (so one small single bud plant) or if your running big pots.  someone I know went from growing 80 plants to 5 plants - same yield.  lights determine yield, not plants.  but just to answer your question, you can get as much as 1/2lbs off a single plant if grown properly under the right conditions."
959181,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 00:13:00,11391,"Oh absolutely, I know there is many variables.  But if a plant yeilds 1/2 lb, how often is that?  Ive studied chemistry but im def not a horticulturist lol"

959195,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 00:34:00,11391,"Thats alot of weed! Howah  My research on this is limited but is it legit to use that much, of cousre depending on the ailment/disease?  And dumb question, after its dried how do you prevent mold growth?  Freeze it?  Or is it being used to make a highly refined cannabis oil?"

However the reason they allow for up to 2 oz is for the folks that need concentrates as edible medicines. Suddenly 2oz a month is-int near enough.

Last week and we had a great talk about medical marijuana.  Shes an awesome dr(which can be rare with general practitioners).  Anyhow she was talking about my use. See they offer so much its kinda silly. I can legally obtain 2 oz per month.  There is no way I can smoke that.  She asked how it was going and I said good. She asked how much I was using and I said about a gram every 2-3 weeks. She says yeah I can see that from your orders.  She asked why? I said thats all I need to see the benefits. Im not smoking to get high, im smoking to relieve my symptoms.  Anyhow that led to her telling me although shes pro marijuana use, shes held off on prescription use quite abit.  I asked why? She says there is a huge influx in the 18-23 year old range trying to get prescriptions. Told her i wasnt surprised.  I said thats too bad people are trying to abuse the system, and she agreed.  I asked her about how she knows when someone could benefit from use, or when shes being taken for?  Well she says some are obvious, terminally ill or people in debilitating pain which is obvious. Then others I started suggesting counselling and workshops before I would even consider it.  I asked how that worked? She said amazing laughing.

958045,ehg,2016-02-16 17:59:00,2666,"  ‘Big Marijuana’ is like the boogeyman in the marijuana world right now. Marijuana opponents warn of the imminent demise of American society due to the threat of big marijuana. Those claims are nothing more than scare mongering. Many people in the marijuana movement and industry fear a corporate takeover of marijuana, and those fears are well founded in my opinion. Travel guru Rick Steves has some stellar advice to combat the corporate takeover of marijuana – grow your own. Rick Steves offered up that advice in an interview he did with KUOW a few weeks back. The comments came as Rick Steves was discussing the need for Washington State to add a home cultivation provision to its marijuana legalization law. As it stands right now, Washington is the only state to legalize marijuana but yet not allow home cultivation. Per KUOW: I personally have no plans to purchase corporate marijuana. That’s not to say that I outright oppose corporate marijuana, I just think that marijuana grown by smaller growers tends to be better because the plants get more attention, and I always root for and support the ‘little guy.’ I don’t grow right now, but I intend to do so this next grow season either at my house or at a family members. The right to grow marijuana at home is something that every state needs to include in its legalization reforms. Washington’s initiative should serve as a lesson to all other states that follow. Rick Steves doesn’t think Big Marijuana should control your pot. That’s one reason people in Washington state should be able to grow their own weed, Steves told KUOW’s Jeannie Yandel. “I don’t want marijuana to go the route of tobacco and have Joe Camel and Big Tobacco and Big Marijuana” dominate the industry, Steves said. “If there’s money to be made, it’s going to attract big corporate interests and they’re going to have the clout. I like the idea of having home grow because it gives people an option to having to buy something from a giant organization. They can just have a few plants on the window sill, and it’s not a big deal.” The host of Travels With Rick Steves was a big supporter of the state’s original marijuana initiative, I-502, which passed in 2012 and took effect last year. Now he supports a proposal to allow people to grow six of their own marijuana plants. It could be considered next year in the state Legislature.  Have a friend with Stage 4 cancer. She was gifted some Tim Simpson oil but refused(unfortunately) and gave it to me a year or so ago. Digested the rice size recommended and it provided relief. Not a cure for my SPMS and severe back pain(surgery didn't relieve)). It really helped way more than the 2 Percoset a day my doctor prescribed. Talked to the doctors i have and they agreed that it is effective but called it a ""grey area"" and wouldn't know how to prescribe. Would be good if medical community could get it to those who really need. All these oxycocet, oxycodone pills are abused by kids big time anyways."

As for the conversation I think the first step is to decriminalize it then take the step to legalize it. To get busted for a roach and then not to be able to cross the border is medieval.  I wonder what can happen for all those that were busted for a small amount in the past if it is legalized. I would like to see anything but trafficking be expunged from the record. I have a pal that was busted for a joint over 30 years ago and after paying the $1500.00 to the US to review his record he was denied and he can't visit his own sister in the US.

We should be ending cannabis prohibition in Canada because the war on cannabis and cannabis users has always been unjustified, immoral and harmful to individuals and society.

There was never any valid scientific, health, or social reason to ban cannabis and punish cannabis users in the first place. As a society, we need to acknowledge these truths before we can start talking about tax rates and points of sale.  The first step must be to immediately end all arrests for possession and personal cultivation, nationwide. That must be at the top of the agenda for any cannabis reform in Canada.  These days, Canada's cannabis community is feeling like the Little Red Hen from the classic fairy tale.  We remember what happened when we asked, ""Who will help us fight against cannabis prohibition?""  ""Not us,"" said the unions. ""There are a lot of jobs for us in arresting and jailing cannabis users.""  ""Not us,"" said the corporations. ""Legal cannabis would hurt our investments in pharmaceuticals.""  ""Not us,"" said the politicians. ""Instead, we're going to pass stricter laws than ever, because that gets us more votes!""  So we did it by ourselves.  Canada's cannabis community opened bong shops and seed shops, we created cannabis magazines and websites, we held cannabis rallies and opened medical dispensaries, all in peaceful civil disobedience and in defiance of these unfair laws.  When some of us were raided by police and ended up in front of a judge, we asked ""Who will help us fund these important court cases, to defend our rights and change these unjust laws?""  ""Not us,"" said the unions. ""All these new prisons mean jobs, jobs, jobs!""  ""Not us,"" said the corporations. ""We can't patent cannabis medicines, so we don't care.""  ""Not us,"" said the politicians. ""In fact, we will fight you in court every step of the way!""  So the cannabis community raised the funds ourselves. We used the money from our openly illegal bong shops, seed banks and dispensaries to pay lawyers and cover court costs, chipping away at prohibition one case at a time.  It was through the courts that we forced the government to first create a medical cannabis program, and every single improvement and expansion of the program has come as a result of lengthy and expensive court battles funded by grassroots activists.  Now that we have mostly beaten the laws in court and on the street, with cannabis gardens and dispensaries spreading into every city and town across the country, we ask, ""Who will help us sell cannabis and profit from legalization?""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the unions. ""We know how to sell liquor, and it's all the same thing, right?""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the corporations. ""We will sell it to you for $15 a gram, as long as the police shut down all the illegal dispensaries first.""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the politicians. ""We will keep the taxes high, so we can pay for all the harm that you cannabis users are causing society.""  To which we say, ""Get lost! We will keep growing it and selling it ourselves. We already have hundreds of dispensaries across the country that are providing great quality cannabis. We already have dozens of court precedents which have forced your police to stop arresting our people. We already have a thriving culture and a vigorous, successful and diversified cannabis industry. We don't need your help, but thanks anyways.""  The moral of the story? Those who show no willingness to contribute to a product do not deserve to share it.  Canada's cannabis community doesn't need the liquor unions, or the corporations, or the politicians to take over our industry. We know what we're doing when it comes to growing, distributing and enjoying cannabis.  The groups that have oppressed our culture and fought against legalization should not be the groups that get to regulate and profit from our sacred plant.  Just get rid of your ridiculous prohibition laws, stop arresting and hassling peaceful people for pot, and leave the rest to us"

Yes, we should be legalizing cannabis in Canada, but not because of the tax revenue it will generate, and not because legalization a better way to keep cannabis from kids, and not even because polls show that most Canadians now support changing the law.

951596,GbayGiant,2016-01-02 22:43:00,1780," ‘Big Marijuana’ is like the boogeyman in the marijuana world right now. Marijuana opponents warn of the imminent demise of American society due to the threat of big marijuana. Those claims are nothing more than scare mongering. Many people in the marijuana movement and industry fear a corporate takeover of marijuana, and those fears are well founded in my opinion. Travel guru Rick Steves has some stellar advice to combat the corporate takeover of marijuana – grow your own. Rick Steves offered up that advice in an interview he did with KUOW a few weeks back. The comments came as Rick Steves was discussing the need for Washington State to add a home cultivation provision to its marijuana legalization law. As it stands right now, Washington is the only state to legalize marijuana but yet not allow home cultivation. Per KUOW:     I personally have no plans to purchase corporate marijuana. That’s not to say that I outright oppose corporate marijuana, I just think that marijuana grown by smaller growers tends to be better because the plants get more attention, and I always root for and support the ‘little guy.’ I don’t grow right now, but I intend to do so this next grow season either at my house or at a family members. The right to grow marijuana at home is something that every state needs to include in its legalization reforms. Washington’s initiative should serve as a lesson to all other states that follow."
952547,GbayGiant,2016-01-10 16:36:00,1780,"The McKnight family is the West Carleton Review’s Newsmaker of the Year for 2015. The Constance Bay family – which includes Mandy and her husband Dave, their son Liam and daughters Maya and Ava – scored a big win in July when Health Canada reversed its medical marijuana position, allowing users to ingest the drug in ways other than smoking. The overturned legislation launched the West Carleton family back into the spotlight as a face of the cause. Mandy fought for years for the right for her now seven-year-old son Liam, who has been diagnosed with a rare condition called Dravet syndrome, to have the legal right to take cannabis in oil form. “It was huge news for us only because now it means Liam can get a reliable, standardized product,” she said. “That’s what we always wanted.” It’s been a big year of firsts for Liam: a family vacation by plane without landing in hospital; the first time he attended the first day of school in September; participating in his school’s Christmas concert; the first time he went 11 days straight without a seizure; and those are just highlights. In April, he earned the Celebrating Excellence Award of Merit for his outstanding contribution to his school community at St. Michael's in Fitzroy Harbour. “He’s just doing so much better overall, health-wise, then what he’s ever done. He’s really doing amazing,” said Mandy. “It really does change everything when he’s able to get out and participate because it means us as a whole family can participate in life.” Mandy and her family were at her parents’ home in Newfoundland when they received the news of Health Canada’s reversal. That trip was the first family outing by plane in more than three years. In the past when they would travel by plane Liam would end up in the hospital for “90 per cent of the trip,” Mandy said, so they stopped visiting her family on the east coast. This time was different. “It was the best two-week family vacation we ever had. He did absolutely amazing. It’s the first time we went home and he wasn’t hospitalized at all.” Other firsts for Liam this year included his first Reconciliation with the help of the staff from his school and Father Michael Ruddick, an Ottawa Senators NHL game, a family hike in the Gatineau hills and a visit to the Diefenbunker without having to use a stroller, a day at the Carp Fair, leisure time on the Constance Bay beach, and the ability to eat food as simple as a banana and cob of corn. All because his seizures are being better controlled. Before July, by-products of marijuana – such as oils – were prohibited. According to the law, Liam was expected to smoke or vaporize the drug, something Mandy said she never would have allowed. “I felt like what was being done to our family, to Liam in particular and to lots of other children, I felt it was a huge injustice. I felt like the government authorized him to use cannabis as a medicine, but then they put up so many roadblocks,” she said. “It creates criminals out of law-abiding citizens.” She began raising awareness about the benefits of cannabis oil through social media – Facebook, Twitter and Instagram; she petitioned federal MPs and created a letter campaign that saw people from across Canada write to their federal politicians about amending the medical marijuana law to allow for extracts; and the West Carleton family’s struggle became news across the world. Liam had his first seizure at nine months old and in April 2010 was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that causes frequent and severe seizures. Liam would often have dozens of seizures in a 24-hour period, lasting as long as four minutes and with a recovery time of hours, said Mandy. After introducing him to cannabis oil, however, Liam’s condition improved dramatically. He still has seizures, but nowhere near the frequency or intensity of before. “Now they last maybe 10 seconds and he can carry on doing whatever he was doing right away,” she said. “The impact of the seizure is not anywhere near what the impact was before. He’s doing so amazing that way.” The McKnight family has helped dozens of other families from around the world – across Canada, the United States, Netherlands and the United Kingdom – consider the benefits of cannabis oil when other conventional medication efforts fail. “I get at least one email a day, some days multiple emails, from parents all over the world who really want to try cannabis for their children. They want to know the steps we took, how we arrived at a decision. We’re always more than willing to share our experiences,” said Mandy. “When we started cannabis, we saw incredible results immediately; we did not have these on traditional medications. I was very active in the Dravet community talking about cannabis, just everything and anything we could to try and get it out there that it’s not this big bad drug it’s made out to be. When I think of all the other (conventional) drugs Liam was on in his short little life, they were 10 times more detrimental.” In February, Liam was weaned from the last of the pharmaceutical medications and now only uses cannabis to control his seizures. The McKnights have been instrumental in raising awareness about Dravet syndrome and epilepsy in the community and beyond. Mandy travelled to Toronto twice to talk about their journey with Liam, first as a keynote speaker at a women in the cannabis industry event and in second as a member of a women’s panel on the impact of cannabis on their lives. She was awarded the Canadian Cannabis Crusader Award, handed out to an individual who has made significant contributions to the progression of cannabis knowledge, access, research or acceptance. It was awarded in recognition of the work she has done campaigning for greater access to cannabis oils and other derivatives for children suffering from seizures. The McKnights have hosted the annual Dravet Walk for the Kids for the past four summers, raising more than $180,000 for Dravet and epilepsy research. “I felt like I was compelled to do something and help in some way. People in this community feel the same way too because they’re amazing and very supportive,” said Mandy. The event has grown considerably; this year saw 18 affected families take part either in person or virtually, up from the original four the first year. The event was supplemented by a Dravet walk at Liam’s school that raised over $1,100. Looking ahead to 2016, Mandy said she’s waiting to hear that licensed producers can begin distributing cannabis oil. Tweed, a medical marijuana corporation based out of Smiths Falls, where Mandy plans to get Liam’s oil, is just waiting on its Health Canada inspection, she said. Being able to purchase a standardized, licenced product will help cut down considerably on the number of steps – and hopefully the cost – of producing her own cannabis oil. Currently, Mandy purchases 150 grams of dry marijuana a month. She uses a recipe for the oil then ships a test sample to B.C. for every batch. The cost per month is more than $1,300 out of pocket, including tax on the cannabis. “It’s crazy. Who can afford that? A lot of people using cannabis are on fixed income, or disability. I hope when legalization comes down all these things are taken into account,” said Mandy. “Once the New Year rolls in and we start getting an idea too about what the plan is for legalization, I plan to definitely reach out to our MP, Karen (McCrimmon), and just highlight some concerns.” Mandy said she would like to see insurance coverage for medical marijuana patients, as well as removal of the tax on a prescription. She said she also wants to ensure medical marijuana users aren’t forgotten if and when the government legalizes pot. “When legalization occurs, I’m worried that there won’t be that urgency anymore for research or insurance coverage for medical patients,” she said. “For us, we really need insurance coverage. We’re managing, barely, but it’s only because of the amazing people especially in this community. If we didn’t have that support I don’t know what we would do.” A number of fundraisers have been held for the family to help cover medical costs and all proceeds go to Liam’s prescription – which the McKnights are very grateful for. “I’m shocked every time somebody does a fundraiser or calls me or would like to do something for Liam,” said Mandy. “I just think this is such an amazing community. There’s just something about him that makes us want to help; it makes us want to do something.” Sammy’s Bay Burgers, the Greystone Grill, the West Carleton Legion, BuzzOn Vapour Lounge are among the many hosting fundraisers for Liam. For continuing to raise awareness – locally and internationally – about Dravet syndrome, epilepsy, and the benefits of marijuana derivatives, the McKnights are our newsmaker of 2015. HONOURABLE MENTIONS Liberal MP Karen McCrimmon was elected in the new riding of Kanata-Carleton as the nation voted overwhelmingly red on Oct. 19. McCrimmon received 51 per cent of the vote in an area that has been a traditional Tory stronghold. The Constance Bay resident was recently appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of Veterans Affairs and the associate minister of National Defence. We are expecting big things of our MP in the New Year, as she has consistently said her constituents are her top priority. Two years after the concept was created, many hundreds of thousands of dollars has been raised, allowing the Sandhills Project to be celebrated with an opening ribbon-cutting earlier this year. Traffic in the new addition to the Constance and Buckham’s Bay Community Centre has been steadily increasing with the new fitness centre and classes, a larger library, and health care services."

This is the guy that brought RCMP officers from BC for the 1 hr. job of guarding luggage from the airport to the hotel during the g20.  Instead of copying the ridiculous way we sell booze he should be looking at the way we sell garlic. Strike all pot laws off the books and start over with regulation  if and only if there is a need for it. Many will use this as medication so there should be no taxes. Legal is as legal as the grass on your lawn and that aint going to happen especially when everyone smells money.

949978,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-20 19:49:00,8243,"Rick, I'm not sure where the weed in Europe is from. I know my Noni from southern Italy told me that they harvested ""Canaba"" from the foothills to make cordage. Occasionally they would smoke the flowers to ""relax"". She emigrated to NYC in 1910. The only reason I know about the Heroin use was there could be found used needles in the AM and small squares of paper around the public areas in towns and cities. Plus all that sudden bursts of energy that I saw in my young cousins wasn't from the carbs in the pasta. I never smelt anything in the air. That in itself is a very poor litmus test as to preferred drugs anywhere. Kinda like saying I have never seen an Bald Eagle in Canada so that must mean there are none.  To get back to the original post I think we are a long way from selling weed to the public any time soon in ON. I won't be vertical when that happens here in Ontario. A province where our legislators treat the public like small children that can't make a decision without their approval. The selling of spirits anywhere but Gov. controlled retail outlets has been in the works for decades. Other than small country variety stores, like the one we have in the village of Selkirk, we now can get a 6 pac of beer only in grocery stores and the closest store to me is 40 miles away in Hamilton. 1 store for more than 1/2 million citizens. And I believe I heard 1/2 of that product must be local micro brewery product. Is there a limit of 1 per customer? I know a 6 pac cost per bottle is more than a 24, so to get 24 that customer that is inconvenienced  is going to pay a hefty premium for that inconvenience the way I understand it. Is the cost of a 6 pac per bottle more than a 24 at Fortino's or wherever? So to go from just getting beer availablr outside of the Beer Store and selling weed to the public is a long stretch. No matter how much I think Wynne and Trudeau Lite drool at the possibility."

951158,Dutch01,2015-12-30 17:28:00,1431,"Counterpoint to Wynne wanting LCBO sales:    Don't Let Those Who Opposed Legal Cannabis Profit From It Now  By Dana Larsen (Director, Sensible BC Campaign For Marijuana Reform, Vancouver's Medicinal Cannabis Dispensary)  Before premiers, liquor unions and corporations start falling all over each other in an effort to cash in on legal cannabis sales, let's remember the real reasons we should be ending cannabis prohibition in Canada.  Yes, we should be legalizing cannabis in Canada, but not because of the tax revenue it will generate, and not because legalization a better way to keep cannabis from kids, and not even because polls show that most Canadians now support changing the law.  We should be ending cannabis prohibition in Canada because the war on cannabis and cannabis users has always been unjustified, immoral and harmful to individuals and society. Let us remember that cannabis prohibition was founded solely on racism and ignorance. There was never any valid scientific, health, or social reason to ban cannabis and punish cannabis users in the first place. As a society, we need to acknowledge these truths before we can start talking about tax rates and points of sale.  The first step must be to immediately end all arrests for possession and personal cultivation, nationwide. That must be at the top of the agenda for any cannabis reform in Canada.  These days, Canada's cannabis community is feeling like the Little Red Hen from the classic fairy tale.  We remember what happened when we asked, ""Who will help us fight against cannabis prohibition?""  ""Not us,"" said the unions. ""There are a lot of jobs for us in arresting and jailing cannabis users.""  ""Not us,"" said the corporations. ""Legal cannabis would hurt our investments in pharmaceuticals.""  ""Not us,"" said the politicians. ""Instead, we're going to pass stricter laws than ever, because that gets us more votes!""  So we did it by ourselves.  Canada's cannabis community opened bong shops and seed shops, we created cannabis magazines and websites, we held cannabis rallies and opened medical dispensaries, all in peaceful civil disobedience and in defiance of these unfair laws.  When some of us were raided by police and ended up in front of a judge, we asked ""Who will help us fund these important court cases, to defend our rights and change these unjust laws?""  ""Not us,"" said the unions. ""All these new prisons mean jobs, jobs, jobs!""  ""Not us,"" said the corporations. ""We can't patent cannabis medicines, so we don't care.""  ""Not us,"" said the politicians. ""In fact, we will fight you in court every step of the way!""  So the cannabis community raised the funds ourselves. We used the money from our openly illegal bong shops, seed banks and dispensaries to pay lawyers and cover court costs, chipping away at prohibition one case at a time.  It was through the courts that we forced the government to first create a medical cannabis program, and every single improvement and expansion of the program has come as a result of lengthy and expensive court battles funded by grassroots activists.  Now that we have mostly beaten the laws in court and on the street, with cannabis gardens and dispensaries spreading into every city and town across the country, we ask, ""Who will help us sell cannabis and profit from legalization?""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the unions. ""We know how to sell liquor, and it's all the same thing, right?""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the corporations. ""We will sell it to you for $15 a gram, as long as the police shut down all the illegal dispensaries first.""  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the politicians. ""We will keep the taxes high, so we can pay for all the harm that you cannabis users are causing society.""  To which we say, ""Get lost! We will keep growing it and selling it ourselves. We already have hundreds of dispensaries across the country that are providing great quality cannabis. We already have dozens of court precedents which have forced your police to stop arresting our people. We already have a thriving culture and a vigorous, successful and diversified cannabis industry. We don't need your help, but thanks anyways.""  The moral of the story? Those who show no willingness to contribute to a product do not deserve to share it.  Canada's cannabis community doesn't need the liquor unions, or the corporations, or the politicians to take over our industry. We know what we're doing when it comes to growing, distributing and enjoying cannabis.  The groups that have oppressed our culture and fought against legalization should not be the groups that get to regulate and profit from our sacred plant.  Just get rid of your ridiculous prohibition laws, stop arresting and hassling peaceful people for pot, and leave the rest to us.  Source: http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/8887122"

""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the corporations. ""We will sell it to you for $15 a gram, as long as the police shut down all the illegal dispensaries first."" The corporations are are obviously in it for a profit just as every other business owner. I don't recall any LP claiming they wouldn't sell unless dispensaries are shut down. That statement made NO sense.  ""We will sell it to you for profit!"" say the politicians. ""We will keep the taxes high, so we can pay for all the harm that you cannabis users are causing society."" Which politician uttered those words? JT actually said the exact opposite in that video from 2013 and there has been very little talk on taxation since.

But Ontario's share still would be about $550 million from pot sales.  Plus you would be employing farmers who would be paying taxes on their businesses and taxes would be applied to every step of way in producing pot.  As for the biker gangs who are deeply entrenched in this business, they are not the sentimentalized fluffy type stuff toys you see on TV. In reality these gangs have absolutely no redeeming qualities and do much harm to society. I'd legalized pot just to choke off this significant revenue stream for these gangs."

The last was a few weekends ago due to peer pressure and I was interested in seeing how it effected my rather significant pain I was experiencing after overdoing it installing a new NG residential furnace here at the cottage and a handful of times in those 23 years. So I am no expert but from my limited experience I drove stoned once and was pulled over for doing 25 KPH in a 50. That was in 90 and the rookie Cop let me go because I believe he had no clue as to what to do. The point being I definitely was impaired and it effected my driving. It was all Cheech and Chong low speed chase. I simply do not enjoy the feeling one gets, I just do not like being hungry and too sleepy to cook.  If this goes nationally and this is legalization as opposed to de criminalizing the predicted revenue stream is far too low at 1.6 billion Samolians. A stream of convicted criminals will be driven from every prison in Canada. These former cons will need to find work and start paying taxes. And buying the stupid stick. Simple.  As far as organized as well as less organized crime all will still their hand in the hat to get their piece. Nothing will change there.  An additional point I would like to make is that Premier Wynne works at warp speed when her caucus sees an opportunity to create a tax stream. Especially when she has the ear of our new young PM. I heard about selling Beer in grocery stores 25 years ago. The PM is in for 15 minutes and you can buy a 6 pac at Fortinos. Although not Federal I believe the PMO had a hand in the move."

They can't make money off of this green plant and is why they don't care about using it!  Rona can find the time to twist reports made by our medical society when money gets involved but she can't seem to read the reports about The Children s lives being saved   The annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society took place in early December, where the largest study presented there confirmed the astounding benefits of medical cannabis to treat seizures. Epilepsy affects one in 26 Americans during their lifetime, “with one-third having a form of the condition that resists treatment or effective management.” Children and young adults are particularly affected by this debilitating condition. The findings of this study add to the growing body of evidence that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive extract of cannabis, can provide the best option for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Of 261 patients given CBD treatment, 45% experienced a significant reduction in seizure frequency, and 9% were seizure-free at 3 months. Some children continued to experience benefits after the trial ended, even one year after. “In the subsequent periods, which are very encouraging, 9 percent of all patients and 13 percent of those with Dravet Syndrome epilepsy were seizure-free. Many have never been seizure-free before,” said lead author Dr. Orrin Devinsky. The Free Thought Project has covered many stories of CBD providing miraculous benefits to children suffering from treatment-resistant epileptic seizures. With scientific evidence piling up, it is no longer deniable that cannabis provides a host of medical treatments. As such, the federal classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug—with no medical benefits—is completely absurd and is a moral affront to millions of people searching for alternatives to Big Pharma products. Research began in the mid-20th century on medical cannabis was quashed with the government’s War on Drugs, but is being rekindled as states continue to legalize medicinal and recreational use. However, clinical trials take a long time, and they are just beginning. The call for ending all government roadblocks to medical cannabis research is growing louder and more furious, from doctors and patients alike. Researchers want to explore all options in the quest to cure human ailments. “As a practitioner, I have had families move to Colorado, and many tried multiple different products,” said Devinsky. “As a doctor, I often don’t feel like I know which of many factors is contributing to a patient doing better or worse. We absolutely need rigorous, scientific data on this.”"

949781,jedimaster,2015-12-18 18:43:00,3472,"headhunter. My own personal opinion on pot legalization? I think it should be legally allowed to be used with minimal bull crap for those that actually need it. Having been with someone that had MS. The actual process of using and obtaining a license for it is much more of a process than you would think should be for someone that really could have used it. It was actually just easier and less effort to stand on the corner and ask someone for a joint than go through the process. The thing that really pisses me off is the average joe pothead who uses medicinal qualities as a guise for them just wanting to get high legally. Its such a lame excuse imo as I have no doubt 90percent of the people that complain about pot and mention medicinal qualities have no such need for it. Any of the people at MS support groups I went to do there very best to hide anything to do with pot. I don't have MS nor do I smoke pot. Have I? Sure in highschool like most people though I grew out of it and enjoy a fine scotch over a bag of weed any day of the week. Do I think its a nanny state to have pot illegal? No I thin its common sense. Its a drug. It has negative side effects. It effects other people in your life whether you care to admit it or even look at it. It stinks. It sets a terrible example for children who don't yet have the capacity to reason that recreational drug use is ok under circumstance A but not ok in circumstance B. I have my reasons for thinking it should remain illegal for recreational use. I think there are some good reasons for it to be legalized. However IMO the scales are tipped in favour of keeping it illegal for recreational use. Now having said that, a lot of people I know smoke pot and I don't care. I frequently get asked if I want a drag or a toke, I just say, nah not my thing, I enjoy my cigs, cigars and scotch just fine.  Smitty, in the states they pick a fairly arbitrary parts per million in the blood stream. They will likely do the same here. The problem with Pot is its really difficult, almost impossible to grow pot at an X parts per million THC level. Even within one strand of bud. How old is it, how long was it dried for, was it cured properly, stored properly etc... Its not like beer where you know you are getting 4.9% alchohol in a bottle. Imagine if beer cold range from 2% to 40 percent alcohol with no taste, visual or scent difference. Molson would be out of business with law suits. Afaik most companies that mass produce for legalized areas stick to edibles where they can more accurately measure levels and put a sticker on them.  There are a lot of intricate things that would need to be done and the Colorado governor had an article published with warnings to other areas looking to legalize about inflated budgets to legalize, how to police etc... it is a big difficult winding road and for what gain? What is the possible loss? To say its only a win win is very naïve imo."

One can rant all they want about it's effects, but it is everywhere and used by a great many people.

This is an unrealistic view and expectation that we will never see. Truth is I don't have the correct answer nor so far on the thread have I see a way out of this mess. Maybe keeping it illegal and closing our eyes as we have in the past is the answer for pot. Allowing another mind altering substance does not seem the answer either. So far alcohol. tobacco and firearms have been allowed out of the box and look at the detrimental effects it has had on society. We have a whole division of the government allocated to controlling the abuses of these products.   Art

You can smoke you stinky cigars and drink your foul tasting scotch. I don't care what you ingest into your own body as long as it doesn't affect me.(second hand smoke and drunk driving). People that smoke weed and get behind the wheel should lose their licence if caught, its irresponsible and endangers others. Legalization isn't going to fill the roads with stoned drivers, the ones that will do it are already doing it. I also don't think that consumption will increase as much as most people are saying it will once it becomes legal. Let me ask you this. If heroin became legal tomorrow would you go and buy some? Probably not, unless you already do heroin. Getting a bit off topic I think cell phone use is a much bigger problem then stoned or drunk drivers. When caught they should have their vehicle towed to a compound and their licence automatically suspended for 30 days for first offence."

Maybe some of them just want a more convenient way to obtain it but don't need it more than any other pothead. Still can't for the life of me understand why it is illegal. Buy it in the store in Colorado but get arrested in the next state over? The lunatics are running the asylum. As far as opening Pandora's box just look at the states that have legalized it. I don't see any horror stories on the news? It's not like everyone is going to start smoking it because it is legal.I don't care if it's free all it does is give me anxiety so I won't be running to the store to buy it but I really don't care if anybody else does.

Their tackle boxes were filled with a wide array of highly illegal substances, there were very few lures. First 10 minutes on the water they made me stop the boat in the middle of some pretty rough seas. I had no clue what was going on. Adam says ""Duuuude our guide last year on Great Bear was killer! We taught him how to roll us the best dubes in some really gnarly water. Now it's your turn!!!""

When these guys found out that Dad was cool with them smoking their pot; they were a pretty happy group. LOL ""Just don't burn my barn down and be ready for work tomorrow"" is all Dad would have to say about it. For the next several years, every spring the guys would send Dad a care package with seeds. Dad planted the seeds in the greenhouse with his tobacco seeds and then transplanted the seedlings to the fields, in between the tobacco plants; throughout the field. Buy the time harvest came, the guys would have their beds, meals and their ""stuff"" (as Dad would call it) ready for them.

For recreational use why not just allow everything to everyone without a prescription. Like Steroids, Viagra, Tylenol 3, Codeine, Oxy etc... A drug is a drug regardless of the use, benefits or side affects. I think it should be regulated. Taking away things that are already legal is a different story like say caffeine."

949248,KraTToR,2015-12-14 23:14:00,506,"LCBO, MCBO.. the key is the letter C for CONTROL.  In other words, glean enormous taxes from the sale of anytime of mood altering substance..lol  Lets face it, the more government we have, the more we'll need it.. I believe they know that!"
949263,GbayGiant,2015-12-15 00:35:00,1780,They don't belong in the same breath let alone a DRUNK STORE.  One kills and destroys lives and  families.  The other... CANNOT and actually save quite a few.     What would you expect from a water retainer?  Dimwit!
949268,manitoubass2,2015-12-15 01:08:00,11391,Yes.  And alcohol plus weed is a very intoxicating combo.  Selling them together is silly.  Although if ya want it your gonna get it anyhow
949273,GbayGiant,2015-12-15 02:00:00,1780,They sell tobacco in corner stores..right beside schools        it doesn't kill anyone though.
949274,GBW,2015-12-15 02:16:00,8460,"I don't care how it's sold but I would like to know if it's pre-rolled (weed) or just a bag? I wonder if it will come in smoke pack format over time too? I don't care either way, just wondering is all as that ""tax"" shouldn't just be a cash grab (we all know it will be) put part as the service to deliver said products."
949275,craigdritchie,2015-12-15 02:17:00,1586,"OP has it right - if the Ontario Liberals are involved, it will be a colossal failure. LCBO will be the only dope dealer in the world to not make a profit."
949283,Dara,2015-12-15 03:17:00,3052,Trudeau said he was going to legalize pot...why can't the government leave it at that.  There is a distribution and sales network operating right now and it is tax free.  What is the government going to do for pot smokers other than grab a bunch of money.  Kathleen just has dollar signs in her eyes...who said she should be able to tax something that has been illegal for years...it just doesn't make sense
949286,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-15 03:38:00,10439,I'm hoping they let private enterprise sell the stuff. I'll be the first to open a dispensary in Yellowknife. Would be a great way to pad the retirement nest egg in a hurry!!!!
949287,Dara,2015-12-15 03:48:00,3052,Making it legal is basically free.  Regulating and taxing will cost millions and who will pay for that.  Just the cost of rewriting all the new regulations into law books will cost lawyers to update.  We can't even smoke a cigarette on a outdoor patio at a bar right now ..I just don't get it

My old man had a 3 pack a day habit. Spent lots of time sitting in a small boat with him or having a BBQ in the back yard with him puffing away right beside everybody. Any law that gives the public a break from second hand smoke I support 100%...and I'm pretty sure the majority of the population feels the same way.
949306,Garnet,2015-12-15 11:54:00,2056,The key is how to make some money now.  Did ok on the election bought and sold for 120% profit.  Now I'm buying on future licences with the ability's expand there medical weed operation's to grow legal weed.

Tax revenue all the way baby!!
949311,dave524,2015-12-15 13:13:00,4508,"Beer is available starting today in select grocery stores in Toronto, if grocery stores can sell beer and do the required age checks etc. there is no reason marijuana needs to be sold at only the LCBO or dedicated licensed dispensaries, even convenience marts selling cigarettes should be able to sell, anyone that can legally buy smokes could legally buy marijuana , I just don't get all the extra security measures over theses already existing products."
949316,Rod Caster,2015-12-15 13:35:00,5784,"LCBO can go ahead and sell it, as long as they don't have exclusive rights to it...which they never will when they are selling something that can be grown beside your tomatoes.  I like the LCBO, it's clean, supports craft breweries and has good selection (other than 24's). To be honest, I trust the LCBO way more than any convenience store. In Quebec, the selection sucks. Molson and Labatts is all you can get at most corner stores."

This one burns me...about 6 years ago Ontario outlawed smoking in bars so all the bar owners built patios so the smoking patrons could go outside for a smoke.  Then, they outlawed smoking on the smoking patios, so all the smokers stand outside the front door and smoke...makes a lot of sense.."
