992271,Tom S,2017-01-21 14:30:00,362,"Spotted a huge stash on Kijiji this morning, looks like an estate situation.  \\http://www.kijiji.ca/v-fishing-camping-outdoor/norfolk-county/fly-fishing/1232390657?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true  Haven't tied a fly in a while now, and it's way more than I could use in a decade. Thought I would pass it on."
992336,aplumma,2017-01-21 20:32:00,6896,Thanks I know we have a few tiers on board hope they get a shot at it if they need it.   Art
992337,dave524,2017-01-21 20:59:00,4508,"Thanks I forwarded it to an old friend via email. When I lived in Norfolk in the 70's , there was a flytying shop in either Delhi or Tilsonburg, ( old timer memory lapse  ) selling materials both instore and  mail order by the name "" Vance's or Vance Bros.""  wonder if this may be related."
992338,muskymatt,2017-01-21 21:04:00,2608,Impressive collection. I tie but that is a little above my commitment level. Probably won't go cheap.
992349,FloatnFly,2017-01-22 00:34:00,1640,"wowsa.......thats a huge collection, that will go for an easy 1000"
992351,Ron,2017-01-22 00:57:00,1683,The contents in the desk alone is worth more than a grand.
992417,Tom S,2017-01-22 18:48:00,362,"The contents in the desk alone is worth more than a grand.  Most definitely, especially if there's some polar bear and harder to find feather capes from before they became rare/restricted. But, it's a sealed bid auction, so it may go for a good price depending on interest. It's only worth that much to the right person, to everyone else it's a pile of dead animal parts."

992483,AKRISONER,2017-01-23 17:11:00,5558,my buddy picked up a huge collection...it seems that the collection had passed through the hands of a few people who had taken what they wanted and then passed it on.  This is nuts though.
992484,porkpie,2017-01-23 18:28:00,2521,"That's some pretty serious dedication to fly tying.  I have a Tupperware full of fluff for when I'm short wooly buggers for steelhead, but that guy took it to a whole new level!"
992639,Tom S,2017-01-25 15:20:00,362,Pretty good deal here if someone wants to take up the hobby.  http://www.kijiji.ca/v-fishing-camping-outdoor/hamilton/fly-tying-kit/1234052192?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true
