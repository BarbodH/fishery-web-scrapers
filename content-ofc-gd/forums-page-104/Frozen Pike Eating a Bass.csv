993026,aplumma,2017-01-29 22:22:00,6896,Pike eats bass and choked on it. Both floated up and as ice thickened bass then pike frozen?   Art
993027,Rizzo,2017-01-29 22:24:00,4754,"I would think the pike died trying to eat that bass, floated upwards and ice formed around them"
993028,Rizzo,2017-01-29 22:25:00,4754,reasonably common to see pike or musky choke on a bass or sheephead

993047,OhioFisherman,2017-01-30 02:09:00,6623,"What Art and Rizzo said, I have see pike choking on Bluegill that went down the wrong way, that bass looks too big for that pike, but once they commit the problems happen?"
993050,chris.brock,2017-01-30 02:24:00,4053," Yep,it's the prey with spiny dorsal fins like bass that can choke a pike. I've seen a few dead pike with a walleye more than half their size sticking out of their mouth."
993078,livinisfishin,2017-01-31 02:13:00,661,That would look cool on the wall!
