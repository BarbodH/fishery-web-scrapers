992767,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 15:55:00,5558, 18.1in+ is a keeper.  These fish account for less than 2% of the walleye population.  i guess i got confused because the zone 11 restrictions say that you must keep between 16 and 23...so nip has its own reg entirely.
992771,Ron,2017-01-26 16:22:00,1683,Nice to see the new guys to ice fishing get a taste of like they did.  Congrats on your new PB.
992785,ckewley,2017-01-26 19:03:00,699,"Awesome stuff man, great photo's"
992846,Freshtrax,2017-01-27 06:15:00,2215,Yep 2 over 18.1 with a sport.   This was 28.5
992848,wormdunker,2017-01-27 07:32:00,1711,Awesome report!  Now you got me thinking to planning a trip.  I know Terrace Suites is an outstanding facility.  Good to know Tama Kwa will put you on some fish.  I guess Tama Kwa doesn't rent their cottages in the winter ( probably not winterized?)
992854,AKRISONER,2017-01-27 13:18:00,5558,"Yep 2 over 18.1 with a sport. This was 28.5  did you weigh it? Im so off when it comes to walleye weights, plus what lake you are fishing makes all of the difference."
992900,Freshtrax,2017-01-27 18:15:00,2215,They have preferd  rates as well.      I won't post on here but it's a deal.     Yea there cottages are electric heat he is working on having one set up for next year he said.    Lol all in original post 9.75 lbs
993042,LeXXington,2017-01-30 01:29:00,1928,Very nice!!!
992607,Freshtrax,2017-01-25 07:18:00,2215,"at Christmas a few of my family members asked me if I wanted to go on an ice fishing trip with them.  I was excited as a few of them had never been.  The tough part was planning a trip with short notice and not much safe ice around.  Gave a call short notice to  Tama-qwa  on south shore of nip. was recommended by a member here and they were more than accommodating.  Great small operator to fish with,, and has a sweet arrangement with Terrace Suites in Calander.  day 1  Picked up a the hotel bright and early by Nikko a quick drive to his place and he ran us out to the huts .  We had fish within minutes.  The day was steady with a walleye every half hour, With some pike and perch mixed in.  3 pm rolled  around and it was nonstop action till 6 . Lost count of how many walleye many double and triple headers.  Fish were suicidal.   Nothing huge smallest was 14  biggest was  17.5  it was almost a joke by the end we just wanted to unhook and get back down to the bottom for another fish.   It was so much fun so share with a few rookie fisherman. I've never whitnesed  anything like it .   We lost a few keepers but none were iced on day 1. By our best guess we landed 40-50 walleye. And lost many more.  Headed back to the hotel for a nice steak dinner in the attached restaurant.     Day 2  Hot breakfast , pickup by Nikko  we all had high hopes from the day earlier but we had to leave at noon so we knew we would miss the evening bite.  The fishing was a little slower we had to work the fish harder to get bites but ended up with a few and my new PB walleye 10 minutes before we had to leave. 28.5 inches and  9.75 lbs.   Fish were caught on lures but the hot item was simple jig and shiner.  Fish were light biting and didn't really strike just felt like dead weight.  They were so tight to bottom we rarely marked the fish we were catching .  Just the occasional bump on bottom.   Anyways here's the fish porn.   We just wanted one to eat    First ever walleye   A cool shot   Nice pike    And my new PB To put in perspective me and my cousin are 6'3"" and 6''4""       Needless  to say I think we were spoiled a bit !"
992609,DanD,2017-01-25 10:41:00,2223,Great report!!!!  Dan.
992610,Terry,2017-01-25 10:52:00,14456,Real nice
992611,crappieperchhunter,2017-01-25 10:55:00,2582,What a trip for a few rookies who have never been before. I hope you told them that wasn't a typical day. And congrats on the PB.
992615,Sterling,2017-01-25 12:44:00,477,Awesome fish. Nipissing really is producing like crazy now.
992624,G.mech,2017-01-25 13:20:00,830,A lot of people have fished for a lot of years on Nipissing and never tied into a fish that size!  I (actually my 10 year old son) had one close about 10 years ago but it pales beside yours.  Great fishing!
992625,Joeytier,2017-01-25 13:27:00,3990,"Amazing walleye for your first time to the big Nip.  I've been able to watch a few that size get iced, but still waiting for my own.  I'm glad you guys got into the kind of action that Nipissing is known for."
992628,porkpie,2017-01-25 14:26:00,2521,Real nice fish!  That action is why we go to nip with the kids each summer now!
992629,Jds63,2017-01-25 14:33:00,1365,"Great report freshtrax .... That's incredible action for sure , congrats on the PB"
992631,Sinker,2017-01-25 14:40:00,8692,Sawwwweeeet! Congrats on the PB. Looks like an awesome time! That pike in the hole shot is awesome. I'd put that on my wall of fame for sure.  S.
992636,AKRISONER,2017-01-25 15:06:00,5558,"glad to see theres still some eyes in that lake. My good buddy is ditching me to fish nipp this weekend, i wonder if he will fair anywhere near as well.  Thanks for the write up and beauty eye"
992643,TJQ,2017-01-25 16:01:00,7806,Nice report!!
992651,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-25 16:33:00,10439,
992653,blaque,2017-01-25 16:42:00,2419,Nice EYE.........even nicer to see an Ice report as all our ice got killed with the warm up down here
992674,Sterling,2017-01-25 20:14:00,477,Nice EYE.........even nicer to see an Ice report as all our ice got killed with the warm up down here  Getting dicey even here in Nipissing. The holes under my shack are 14 inches now...
992679,huzzsaba,2017-01-25 21:01:00,884,Always love your fishing reports Andrew!  What bait did you guys get the pike on?  I would love to catch a pike one day ice fishing.  I too caught my first ever walleye a couple of weeks ago on Nosbonsing.
992684,AKRISONER,2017-01-25 22:13:00,5558,Always love your fishing reports Andrew!  What bait did you guys get the pike on?  I would love to catch a pike one day ice fishing.  I too caught my first ever walleye a couple of weeks ago on Nosbonsing.  Ive been hammering pike on buckshots tipped iwth minnow heads this year. 20lb flurocarbon lead.  Cant go wrong with a tip up either!
992704,spincast,2017-01-26 01:07:00,3279,cool report - that pike shot through the hole is    congrats on the PB
992711,GBW,2017-01-26 01:26:00,8460,Sawwwweeeet! Congrats on the PB. Looks like an awesome time! That pike in the hole shot is awesome. I'd put that on my wall of fame for sure.  S. Same! Thanks for the great read and congrats on the PB!
992714,captpierre,2017-01-26 01:49:00,2521,Look at the belly on that eye. Lots to eat on Nip it seems.
992720,Freshtrax,2017-01-26 02:55:00,2215,"Thanks for all the kind words guys ,  I'm going to mount this one it will be my second attempt at taxidermy will pst pics when it's done.   These ones were jig and 3 inch shiner  if I were targeting pike I'd use a bigger minnow hooked through the back on a tip up about half way to the bottom.     I did see a monster pike swiming under the hole on day one was cool to sight fish him but could not get it to commit."
992729,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-26 07:29:00,8243,That is one beauty of a Nip Walleye. Came close to that size there a few times but many moons ago. It is good to see a lunker come out of that lake. For Nipissing that is big.
992757,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 14:19:00,5558,am i reading this correct? On nip an eye has to exceed 23.6 inches just to be able to keep one? holy crap...  how long was that one man?

992764,grimsbylander,2017-01-26 15:29:00,3016,Very nice report and nice walleye! It's great to hear Nipissing to producing good quantities of fish. The quality will look after itself.
