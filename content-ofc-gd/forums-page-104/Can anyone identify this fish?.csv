992311,Locnar,2017-01-21 18:06:00,645,"  My friend sent me this picture, apparently his friend caught a bunch of these while ice fishing in Northern Quebec... Amos, Quebec to be precise. As far as I'm aware, all the water is freshwater around there. And this looks like an ocean fish, similar to a ""rockfish"". I've been trying to research the the hell I'm looking at here, but to no avail so far. Any thoughts?"
992312,porkpie,2017-01-21 18:07:00,2521,"Don't know, buts its hella ugly!"
992314,Locnar,2017-01-21 18:12:00,645,"Maybe the guy wasn't fishing in amos. Looks like an acadian redfish, likely from Saguenay Fjord?"
992325,GBW,2017-01-21 18:34:00,8460,never seen anything like it in fresh water before but guessing based on the eyes popping out of it's head it was from some deep waters.

992328,Locnar,2017-01-21 19:00:00,645,"Just got a response on where it was actually caught. It was on the Saguenay Fjord, it's an Acadian Redfish. My buddy threw me right off, saying it was caught in Amos, Quebec... but it is a marine fish."
992342,Fisherman,2017-01-21 22:50:00,7201,Apparently quite tasty.
992400,akaShag,2017-01-22 14:15:00,2073,"aka ""sebaste"" au Quebec  And if I recall correctly, this was called a redfish in English, not an ocean perch.  But those may both be (English) names for the same fish.  Yes they are tasty, and back to Fisherman, surely you have had some back up in the Saguenay region?Doug"
