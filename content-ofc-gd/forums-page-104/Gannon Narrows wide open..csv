992339,captpierre,2017-01-21 21:19:00,2521,Took a run up to the cottage Surprised to see the Narrows wide open from shore to shore as far as the eye can see in both directions. North end of Pigeon is still locked up but covered with water.
992340,lew,2017-01-21 21:24:00,12766,Sure has been a crazy winter so far.
992341,ecmilley,2017-01-21 22:47:00,2163,Was out on sturgeon today lots of water on ice. About 3 inch of soft white ice and 14 of hard clear. Jiffy was making eady work of it
992343,porkpie,2017-01-21 22:55:00,2521,"I love steelhead fishing, but since the ice started I haven't had quite enough icefishing yet. I wouldn't mind some more cold weather"
992571,Sinker,2017-01-24 21:33:00,8692,I hope to be icefishing until mid april LOL  S.
992572,Big Cliff,2017-01-24 21:35:00,6899,I hope to be icefishing until mid april LOL  S. Or June LOL
992578,esoxansteel,2017-01-24 22:26:00,1307,"Im suprised that there is as much ice as reported, we really havnt had much cold weather at all"
992594,chris.brock,2017-01-25 01:30:00,4053,"Me too.  This past weekend, I didn't know if it would be safe for us to get out. I went and checked and there was 8"". It's like the immaculate conception of ice. Weird."
992605,scuro2,2017-01-25 05:40:00,904,Ice conditions at the north and south poles are way beyond normal conditions in our era. Me thinks that these two incidents are not pure chance unrelated coincidences. Where I live in southern ontario we will have had what looks to be 4 cold days in Jan. Most daily averages are above zero and the ground is not hard while the grass is green. Unheard of...  
992680,Raf,2017-01-25 21:13:00,3495,"unless you're right in toronto or further south, the nights are still cold, sub zero.  this time of year nights are longer than days therefore ice."
993021,buckhorn250,2017-01-29 21:20:00,85,Was up at the cottage yesterday. Gagnon narrows is still completely open. Only ice is that piles up in the inside corner of Pigeon. Buckhorn is completely ope right up to the two islands.
