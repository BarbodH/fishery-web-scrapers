Far too many for us because I don't like keeping anything frozen for more than 4 months, even that is too long for me. We can easily tell the difference between a frozen perch over 1 that is fresh. We have bought frozen perch and Walleye in the middle of the winter in Pt. Dover for a big scarf and there is a huge difference in taste. Like night and day. Both were frozen in water too."

992515,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-24 03:24:00,8243,"The Knecktel (sic) family own a number of restaurants in Dover, 4 at least. I have only had yellow perch there. The off tasting perch still had the skin on them and I would venture a guess that they were yellows, big yellows. They may have been white perch though, the scales are very similar. Good point, perch are perch for marketing purposes I imagine. Cheap too at 10 bucks a pound so who knows.  Regardless there were no left overs.  So to answer my question Simcoe and Erie are the only exceptions for possession limits to exceed daily limits I take it."
992518,Woodsman,2017-01-24 10:25:00,1286,One thing to note is you can have 100 perch in possession in Ontario no matter where they came from as long as you don't have any more than a daily limit from on individual zone. (Lake Simcoe & Lake Erie are exemptions) It's quite legal for example to have 50 from Lake Huron & 50 from Zone 17 in possession.
992545,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-24 17:26:00,8243,"I would love to know how a CO could tell what zone a fish came out of. They can't unless they do a DNA test, maybe. All someone needs to say is they are all from Erie, or Simcoe."
992556,Sinker,2017-01-24 20:38:00,8692,"Well, let me tell you from personal experience, if you are travelling from one zone to another where posession/slot limits are different, you best have a receipt or something to prove you were at least in the zone you say you were in.  I was coming home from up north(near north bay) one early spring from an icefishing trip. On the way home, we swung by lake simcoe (2 whitefish limit, closed march 15th)  to see if we could launch a boat yet for perch, as the ice was coming off. We had 5 whitefish each in the back of the truck that we had caught that morning from the  lake up north (limit was 25 each back then, open all year). A CO stopped us and asked to check our gear. No problem....until he saw the whities and instantly assumed they were from simcoe. He went nuts, and didn't believe a word we said about being up north. I had no proof of where we had been. I ended up calling my bank and let the CO talk to them about my last bank withdraws before he would believe us. He thought he had us red handed LOL  S."
