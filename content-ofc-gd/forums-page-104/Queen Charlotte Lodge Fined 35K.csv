992517,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-24 03:34:00,8243,"Wow, I am surprised. Isn't that the very well known lodge that had a reality TV series on FNL some years back? They were supposed to be top notch. I bet someone got the boot."
992519,icedude,2017-01-24 11:10:00,459,i bet you're right OI   Paul  www.perchinforms.com
992521,leaf4,2017-01-24 11:46:00,2466,Seems pretty light... $500 each offense? The 32k is ok but still seems like more should have been charged being that it's a lodge and blatantly disregarded the limits
992522,dave524,2017-01-24 12:06:00,4508,I'd like to know the whole story. What happens if a guest catches a limit of salmon and halibut and has it frozen for transport home and then leaves with out it ??? The guest taking his spot has a limit of ZERO ???

992527,AKRISONER,2017-01-24 13:41:00,5558,"that makes a lot more sense. The processing of the fish was being mishandled and therefore they were in violation.  My guess is that they had left the fish processing to newer employees and the situation was being totally mismanaged.  I fished Massett this summer and Its pretty pathetic to be honest the way fish processing and handling is managed up there. I had my catches processed by a company called haida wild and they had mis-identified some of our catches as well.  I will say that 35,000 is a joke fine for a place like that when considering the fact that a trip to one of those lodges costs upwards of 6 grand for a week.  Its also sad to hear that there is that much abuse of the system going on when the fishing has definitely been in decline over the past 20 years."
992531,jimmer,2017-01-24 15:32:00,2730,disgusting to say the least.
992583,bare foot wader,2017-01-24 23:44:00,1354,"lots of this stuff goes on at the lodges unfortunately  these violations were catches from their unguided boats, and the lodge intentionally failed to report their clients, hence the mislabeled and mishandled packages....kinda interesting how the DFO showed up for a surprise inspection..."
992599,dave524,2017-01-25 02:20:00,4508,"Sounds like the DFO went on a fishing trip of their own with the rule book  wide open, wonder how many freezers of members here would pass the acid test as far as fish packaged to make counting possible, patch of skin for ID and even would the length be able to be determined in the case of slot sizes, don't be too quick to cast the first stone."
992630,BillM,2017-01-25 14:35:00,17367,"I'd be nailed for sure, we never keep a patch of skin on our fillets, lol."
992780,bare foot wader,2017-01-26 18:00:00,1354,"I see what you're saying, but it wasn't at all like that....they need to do more ""fishing trips"" imo, these are not just a few accidental mistakes...  DFO transport regs apply until an angler reaches their permanent residence or delivered to processing facility, pretty easy for any honest angler to comply with....sport retention of hali is a very hot issue, no problem with lodges receiving fines when they deliberately abuse the resource"
993051,LeXXington,2017-01-30 02:28:00,1928,"Cost of doing business,..  They got sloppy, probably cut corners. no checks and balances. I am sure new policies and procedure are now in place.  All lodges will shape up.  All that being said, they should not have that much fish in the freezer.. Really sloppy they should have donated fish not taken by clients."
