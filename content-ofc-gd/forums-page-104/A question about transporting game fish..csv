992415,Canuck2fan,2017-01-22 18:22:00,1444,"The following are cut and pasted from the 'Ask a CO' on Outdoorontario.net:  http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html   Question 38:  Does a person need a fishing licence if they have fish (ie. salmon) in their possession (freezer) even if the fish was given to them? Can i legally give a fish i caught to someone who doesn't have a licence or might they be in violation of the act?   Answer from the MNR:  There is absolutely no problem with you giving fish to a friend or anyone else and they do not need a fishing licence. The same goes for game and is widely used by hunters who have participated in the OFAH food for the need y project. That being said, there are a couple of points to remember. a) Those fish still are part of your daily limit. In other words you cannot take your girlfriend out fishing with you even though she does not fish, but ‘give’ her a limit, so that you can catch a second limit on the same day. The actual wording is “catch and retain in one day or possess”. You could, however, catch a limit of walleyes today, take them home and give them to your mother-in-law (hey, this is hypothetical!) then go out the next day and catch a limit for yourself. Remember that fish in your freezer are part of your limit, so you cannot have six, ten, or twenty limits of walleye in your freezer at home, even though you only took them six per day. Possession limits apply to the receiving individual as well.  Question 164:  This has already been answered, but I have been told a CO has given a different response, so I'm just checking again. Sorry to be repetitive: An angler catches his limit of, say, 2 lakers and gives them to his neighbor who does not fish and has no fishing licence. The next day, same angler catches another two lakers and again gives them to the same neighbor. This goes on until the neighbor has 18 lakers in his freezer. The response in Question 38 says this is illegal. I.e., an angler may give away his daily limit (although be may not continue fishing that day), but the recipient is then bound by the possession limit and hence cannot have in his freezer more than that. I assume that if there are other members in the household, each of them could also have their limit, so that unless there are 9 people in the house, having 18 lakers in the freezer is illegal. But a reliable source just told me a CO told him this is perfectly OK. Comments?   Answer from the MNR  This is correct as is the response to Question 38. One person can have his/her possession limit and no more, regardless if they possess a fishing licence or not.  Question 164a:  Related to this, is the possession limit for the recipient the same as what the angler has? I.e., if the angler has a conservation licence, is the recipient of the fish bound by conservation limits?  Answer from the MNR  The possession limit for the recipient is that of a regular (non-conservation) licence.  Question 164b:  I got the feeling talking to the person that the confusion arises due to the neighbor not being licenced, as though the regulations apply only to licenced anglers physically out there fishing. I.e, if somebody gives you a fish, you are not bound by the regs. To add to the confusion, Question 66, which asks if it is illegal to possess a fish if you don't have a licence is still ""with MNR for clarification"". Perhaps that question and lack of reply has spawned the above  Answer from the MNR It is legal to possess fish without an angling licence.  Answer from the MNR is total Bull as a blanket statement....  Doesn't address the fact that under 16 or over 65 you can fish without a licence much less be in possession of fish... Used to give fish to my grandmother who NEVER had a licence in her life, but as a senior she was OBVIOUSLY fully entitled to have a sportman's possession limit of EVERY type of fish at any time, because she could have legally fished for them and gotten them herself without a licence!!!!  So whoever posted that from the MNR needs to go back retake their training course (do they even had one? LOL)"

The same goes for anyone else that lives there. They can have more fish possession than I can and I'm the one paying for an Outdoors card and license. C'mon Man!   2 things:  1)  The labeling of the fish isn't really covered in black and white anywhere that I can find but based on my interactions with the OMNR&F I don't think it would be  necessary in this scenario (i.e a recipient transporting no more than their limit of fish).  Where it comes in from my experience is this.  The MNR  has suggested that if you are transporting your limit of fish as well as another fisherman's who isn't with you that it would be a very good idea if they were all be labelled since you are in fact in possession of more than your limit.  Even labelled, you are still not 100% in the clear and could still be in trouble if you can't convince a CO that the other person(s) was in fact fishing with you and is travelling separately.  It's kind of like the fact that you need to make sure you can prove that you did in fact fish for two days in areas where you are allowed a double possession limit (100 perch possession limit on Lake Simcoe for example).   Sadly, this would be a discretionary thing that most of us here don't really like since we all prefer black/white, yes/no sort of rules.  2)  You are correct that an unlicensed angler currently can posses more than you can with your Conservation license.  May not seem right or fair but that's just the way she goes.  The upside is that you can go fishing and they cannot!"

The next day I can do the same because she has no license. Now the freezer has 4 walleyes. Then next day I go out again and keep another 2 walleyes, so the freezer now has a total of 6 walleyes because she doesn't have ANY fishing license and we are 100% legal at this point. However, if she also had a conservation license we would be over the limit by two walleyes.......DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE when you think about it.  the CO would laugh and say nice try, then hand you a fine for being over limit.  think about it rationally, you live in the SAME house.  so you have a freezer with 2 limits in it, you're the only one with a license.  the CO will reasonably come up with the conclusion that you caught the fish.  a judge would decide the same thing.  i think the only way this would work is if there a kid that does not require a license, kids 17 or younger are exempt from having a license. or if you are over the age of 64."

Theoretically, 1) if fish given to a non-licence holder remain as ""possession"" to the licence holder, and, 2) if the same fish cannot be counted toward two separate possession limits, 3) there is an open agreement to where the fish came from.  So Angler A catches his limit and Angler B catches his limit. No issues. Then they both give their fish to Norman No Licence. At what point do two limits of legally caught fish become illegal? Can Norman keep these fish as long as Angler A and B acknowledge the fishes origin if required, AND, neither Angler A or B have enough fish in their personal possession that would put them over their limit INCLUDING Norman's fish??  Well, this would be hard to nail down but that's not the discussion. And since it would be very difficult for law enforcement to enforce, they generally make it easy on themselves and simply state, nobody can have more than a possession limit. And to me, this makes sense. Being a non licence holder is not really an excuse for not knowing the law. We don't forgive poachers with no licence, newly landed immigrants, people from Ottawa, lol kidding.

If the fish are clearly id'd. The crazy thing I have learned is that a non licensed person can possess more fish than I can with my conservation licence. So my non licensed, non fisherman room mate/wife/son/daughter/renter/mother in law/ stranger on the couch can possess a full sportsman limit on their side of the fridge and I can only possess for my conservation limit on my side of the fridge. The same goes for anyone else that lives there. They can have more fish possession than I can and I'm the one paying for an Outdoors card and license. C'mon Man!"

991921,G.mech,2017-01-19 20:12:00,830,"The following are cut and pasted from the 'Ask a CO' on Outdoorontario.net:  http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html   Question 38:  Does a person need a fishing licence if they have fish (ie. salmon) in their possession (freezer) even if the fish was given to them? Can i legally give a fish i caught to someone who doesn't have a licence or might they be in violation of the act?   Answer from the MNR:  There is absolutely no problem with you giving fish to a friend or anyone else and they do not need a fishing licence. The same goes for game and is widely used by hunters who have participated in the OFAH food for the need y project. That being said, there are a couple of points to remember. a) Those fish still are part of your daily limit. In other words you cannot take your girlfriend out fishing with you even though she does not fish, but ‘give’ her a limit, so that you can catch a second limit on the same day. The actual wording is “catch and retain in one day or possess”. You could, however, catch a limit of walleyes today, take them home and give them to your mother-in-law (hey, this is hypothetical!) then go out the next day and catch a limit for yourself. Remember that fish in your freezer are part of your limit, so you cannot have six, ten, or twenty limits of walleye in your freezer at home, even though you only took them six per day. Possession limits apply to the receiving individual as well.  Question 164:  This has already been answered, but I have been told a CO has given a different response, so I'm just checking again. Sorry to be repetitive: An angler catches his limit of, say, 2 lakers and gives them to his neighbor who does not fish and has no fishing licence. The next day, same angler catches another two lakers and again gives them to the same neighbor. This goes on until the neighbor has 18 lakers in his freezer. The response in Question 38 says this is illegal. I.e., an angler may give away his daily limit (although be may not continue fishing that day), but the recipient is then bound by the possession limit and hence cannot have in his freezer more than that. I assume that if there are other members in the household, each of them could also have their limit, so that unless there are 9 people in the house, having 18 lakers in the freezer is illegal. But a reliable source just told me a CO told him this is perfectly OK. Comments?   Answer from the MNR  This is correct as is the response to Question 38. One person can have his/her possession limit and no more, regardless if they possess a fishing licence or not.  Question 164a:  Related to this, is the possession limit for the recipient the same as what the angler has? I.e., if the angler has a conservation licence, is the recipient of the fish bound by conservation limits?  Answer from the MNR  The possession limit for the recipient is that of a regular (non-conservation) licence.  Question 164b:  I got the feeling talking to the person that the confusion arises due to the neighbor not being licenced, as though the regulations apply only to licenced anglers physically out there fishing. I.e, if somebody gives you a fish, you are not bound by the regs. To add to the confusion, Question 66, which asks if it is illegal to possess a fish if you don't have a licence is still ""with MNR for clarification"". Perhaps that question and lack of reply has spawned the above  Answer from the MNR It is legal to possess fish without an angling licence."

It was about a non license holder ""transporting"" fish. I am under the impression that ""possession"" would include transporting them.  A different situation as far as possession goes.
