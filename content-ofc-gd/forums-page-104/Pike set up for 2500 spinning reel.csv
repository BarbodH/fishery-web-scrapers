The truth is, and ive stated it here many times, im often fishing pike with 10-15 lb PP or suffix 832, no leader, in current, shallow rocks  I very rarely get bit off.  I guess im just lucky with that.  I also use much shorter rods than most, a 6'7"" medium heavy and spinning reel  I personally find, and yes its sounds rediculous, the heavier I go on line the more pike bite me off"

And lots of good replies and advice thanks a lot guys!  Happened only once last season. As far as the spoons/spinners are concerned I would say you would be fine using the leader. Yes you put the mono before the braid as a backer, so the line doesn't slip. If you goto a tackle shop and have them put the line on they should do it all for you. Or you could do as mentioned before and use a piece of electrical tape if you don't want to use the backer."
993080,msp,2017-01-31 02:40:00,1336,"You really only want to fill about 1/3 of your spool with mono. I always keep a cheap spool of 8 pound test red wolf from canadian tire for all my backing needs. You will still be able to get 150 yards of braid on your reel. That should last you a while. After a couple seasons if you start to see your backing after a long cast, replace your braid with fresh new braid"
993081,manitoubass2,2017-01-31 02:41:00,11391,"^^^ dont remember where I got the tip?(likely on here)  Instead of backing, wrap the braid 6 or 7 times around the spool before your knot.  Then tape but its really not needed if you tie it nice"

There is a definite drop off in bites as soon as you use anything but fluoro leaders. To date have only had one clear cut bite off over 100 pound fluoro. I've had the braided cut above the fluoro...like the pike attacks at  a foot above the lure...been making longer fluoro leaders too

Usually I use 8 pound mono ( year round line ) and when fishing pike just add a steel leader.  But when summer time comes there is also a lot of bass and don't want to risk my lures to the pike. I got a tip to use flourocarbon 30 pound test as a leader ?????? And to use 20-30pound power braid as a main line "" cause it's same thickness as the 8 pound mono? Was wondering if you guys can help me out and what you guys think"
993008,porkpie,2017-01-29 17:39:00,2521,I use 15 or 20lb power pro on a lot of my spinning reels.  It's cheap by the yard at my local shop and lasts a long time.  For pike I've been using thin wire black steel leaders for ages.  I bought a pack of about 40 maybe ten years ago and haven't managed to work my way through them.  I use fluoro quite a bit for steelhead and pickerel but I see no reason for using it with pike or bass.  But by all means give it a go.  Power pro is pretty good stuff though!
993011,kickingfrog,2017-01-29 18:30:00,8333,"A search on here should turn up a few threads on this topic. There are of course varying opinions. Mine is that while braided line it strong it is not as abrasion resistant as the same pound test fluorocarbon. The flouro is thicker and that helps a bit when a pike roles in the line too. I will use mostly 20 to 40lb flouro for pike. The thicker stuff does dampen the action on the suspending husky jerks that I like to use early in the season but with spoons, spinners and such the action really isn't affected so I'll use the heavier stuff then.  There are a few different knots that you can use to join the two depending on if the lines are, or are not, similar thickness. Winter is a great time to practice those knots."
993016,Andy,2017-01-29 20:07:00,330,"I know what ya mean re; lures and pike when fishing for bass. I have used a braided line on my pike spinning rod set up, but the brand I tried was too noisy for my liking so I went back to mono. I may try Spiderwire Stealth braid on my spinning outfit as I use it on my heavy baitcasters and it's one of the quietest braids I've used. What I've started using on bass lures in pike waters is micro leaders. For example, Cabelas.ca has Danielson thin wire leaders. They come as light as 12 lb test and only 5 inches long.  I think that these leaders have less impact on a bass lure than a piece of heavy mono or flouro. You may need to replace them more often than heavier wire leaders, and a big pike can pop open the smaller snaps if you horse it in, but's it an option that I like. Or make you own thin wire leaders out of something like that Knot2Kinky stuff in a light test with whatever size snaps and swivels you want, although I find it a bit awkward  to work with."
993018,Garcia96,2017-01-29 20:48:00,45,Thanks for the reply guys. As for thicker stuff. Is 30 pound flourocarbon think? Will it effect my jerkbaits? Pike won't chew through the 30pound test? Or even 20? And if I did tried flouro for a leader should I stick with mono as a main line or switch to power pro braid?

993045,kickingfrog,2017-01-30 01:55:00,8333,"For bass? Not necessarily. For lightish topwaters I won't use flouro leaders, I'll tie the superline direct or use a mono leader if I'm not near cover. For slop topwaters I'll usually have a flouro leader because I think it doesn't cut into the lily pads as much but if it gets nicked up I'll just tie direct to the braid."
993046,msp,2017-01-30 01:58:00,1336,I would recommend 20 pound power pro. Don't forget to add some mono backing on your spool before your braid so it doesn't slip on the reel. Minimum 50 pound flouro leader of pike. You can take the leader off in the summer when bass fishing. Or you can use a 12 pound flouro leader in the summer for bass if fishing clear water
993048,GBW,2017-01-30 02:15:00,8460,A leader is only used here (for me) rarely and I direct tie to either super slick8 or spiderwire stealth on spinning reels.  Most lures used are a reaction lure and not fished slow hence the lack of a leader for me.  If not using a backing on the spool then a single wrap of electrical tape works well to avoid any line slippage.
993049,OhioFisherman,2017-01-30 02:24:00,6623,"If you're fishing for bass or pike? 20 - 30 pound braid sounds a lot better to me than 8 pound mono!

993053,manitoubass2,2017-01-30 03:03:00,11391,Thats what I do. No backing. Just a piece of Electrical tape

But that's what my bro uses, he says he likes it better. We both use what works best for us. As far as affecting the action of a jerkbait, I haven't noticed any but I could be wrong. And yes both work great, me and my brother both have 2500 size shimano spinning reels."

When i start actually chasing big pike then i basically just use my musky set ups.  ive played with the sizing for a while continuously going thinner and thinner until i start getting cut off and then i back off. Ive caught countless pike on this set up and ive only been cut off once by a 25+lb fish, the swivel has broken a couple of times but thats about it."
993057,grimsbylander,2017-01-30 13:24:00,3016,"For using a jerkbait on heavier fluoro, tie a loop knot so the jerbait is less obstructed by the line. It's not 100% but it's much better than tying direct."
993058,msp,2017-01-30 13:26:00,1336,"I use 80 - 100 pound flouro leader for pike and sometimes 30 titanium wire. This leader does not seem to affect the action on the jerkbaits much. One spool of the 80-100 pound will last you a long time. Trust me. We have had this argument in the past. I have had big pike slice right through 50, 80 pound flouro. Better to be safe than sorry"
