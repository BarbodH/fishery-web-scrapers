992404,Mister G,2017-01-22 15:23:00,1429,"A sub category would still be something that needs to monitored. people would post stuff in general discussion no matter how many times we chop up the site. Worse yet I will still get the same number of P.M.s about he said she said in nature. We keep them in the same section so we can see them at a glance. We also do not wish to encourage inflammatory threads.  i have been very liberal on letting things run there course but it seems people want to make this a political site and it isn't. We are working on what the new cut off point is for them. The owners are tired of getting hollered at for running a thread to long and running a thread to short if we get hollered at no matter what we do we will choose the easiest path. You all as members have the responsibility to treat the other members with utmost respect at all times the rules are a good guideline. We are not babysitters we are here to organize a place for everyone to feel comfortable and talk about your outdoors life. We could be hardasses and use the ban button but in 4 years I have yet to use it. I as well as the other owners are happy that this site is here it is a memorial to how we met as well as a place where we can talk to our old and new friends. The cure in my opinion is to state your facts in a thread and then listen to the replies. It is not a place to argue, insult or belittle someone into seeing your point. All of the political threads have one thing in common and that is people can't accept someone else's views and that is the reason they are an endangered species. You will find a dozen sites that will let you tear into each other on any subject you want so if that is what you are looking for to get thru the winter then feel free to join one and then once it is out of your system then come here and share a story with your friends here. This site is run in the old fashion way we are about respect, helpfulness and friendship it is what we started with and what we see as our future.  Thanks for reading this  Art Any MAN to post to you or other mods that he doesn't like what someone else posted doesn't belong on a fishing site AND that is the person I would ban."

The owners of the board have accepted the possibilities of either direction and are fine with it. I look forward to talking to all of the people who stay and I hope to welcome the new members who have lurked because they didn't like the ugly undertones of the political threads.

992332,aplumma,2017-01-21 19:41:00,6896,Here is an excerpt that I sent to a member who wants to be here but feels we have lost a good part of the board.  When all 4 of the owners decided no more non fishing political threads we are not going to go back on it. You do still have the option of getting a group together and using chat for your political debates. It is not moderated but we expect it to be used with respect towards each other.. This is not because of the recent complaints though this is a long time coming. I have tried to head it off a few times before and every one ignored my warning. I have tried to moderate them but I got no help from the boards members. People kept going past the rules. if this is the thing that crashes the board then so it will be. I spend 70% of my time on issues generated by the political issues and only 30% for everything else. We are known for having a broad range of topics that we discuss and we are proud of this but how many times can we have people pissing on each other before it makes a mockery of what we want? There are lots of political site that you can rip into each other out there they are concerned about the click rate so they let people do what they want. This site is not about how many members we have or how many times our ads pop up.This board has always been about family and community we all got busy and let it turn into something that lost its direction. If we lose people who are here only for the political debates then it is not really a loss. Think back to what this board was when it started a group of us would meet in chat for hours and shoot the bull now it is no more. We would all plan trips to each others lake and go fishing with our friends. We had so much love for each other that we had G2Gs with fishing tournaments and a crazy trophy that meant everything to win.We have lost all of this now I am constantly putting out fires and the fun of coming here is lost. I have a shimmering light though and instead of just saying uncle and shutting down the board we decided to try to get back to a place where it is a joy to visit and be a part of. Look at the content of the board and really read the posts about family and how happy we are for a birth and a high point of peoples lives. Now read a political thread it is nothing but arguments and name calling how is that a high point of the board?  â€‹The NF place has been decided a long time ago and the simple reason is we do not want a separate place for people to argue/disrespect each other that is easily accessible to members and non members. The chat feature is for members only. and you have to log in so no more I accidently arrived in a thread that offends me.  Hopefully if you really think about it you will find that the political threads are just not fitting in here.  i will miss you if you leave but it is a choice you have to make and one that will have no penalties because your account will be waiting for you if or when you come back.

992350,Ron,2017-01-22 00:48:00,1683,"Here is my .02 worth.  I come on this site, I click on ""View new content"".  I ignore the threads i have no interest in. I don't post on the political threads because i don't read the political threads. it's kind of cool concept, if you don't read the posts you have no interest in, you don't have to complain about them.  Easy peasy!  Big Cliff, I am guilty of reading your fishing thread and not replying to it. I will attempt to make replies to the posts that interest me in the future. I understand where the frustration comes in play here.  Winternet..... Aargh... it's in the air.....  Cheers, Ron..."

Art Political threads never fit in, they separated members and drove people away. Worse it wasn't even good political discussion, a good chunk of it was ""all politicians are corrupt and all government was bad"". In short anarchists were in charge and at one point I just had enough and decided anything related to global warming would be my line in the sand. I had to wade through schools of climate DENIERS. Something was wrong here, no where on earth could you find so many climate DENIERS congregated in one place.  I love fishing but enough was enough because some things matter, and so for the most part my posts became political.  I'm really happy this decision was made. It will draw people back. In celebration I am posting a recent catch pick and am working up a report on a decade of fishing in Cuba. "
992365,SirCranksalot,2017-01-22 03:19:00,3291,"Good decision!!  This forum has been used too often to spread hatred and bigotry. I have managed to get at least 1 thread locked to prevent the spread, risking being restricted or even banned in the process. I'm glad I won't feel obliged to do that again. If you want to listed to guys talk thru the hole in their head about politics, just head on over to the OFAH site. Lots of that garbage over there."
992367,Toronto_Angler,2017-01-22 03:21:00,698,It's a great decision. I stopped posting here because of the nonsense that was posted in the political threads. Seriously cliff you used to be a great poster here and over the last few years your constant political complaining has been ridiculous.
992370,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-22 03:28:00,8243,"I think that political threads and some of the urination contests that went on were like slowing down and gawking when there is a traffic accident. It is only human nature to want to see some of the carnage. Actually not much to see here.  I will miss them here as I am always in for a good intelligent conversation and since I am outside the work force now those daily political meetings on the smokers porch or around the proverbial water cooler I am no longer privy to. There is plenty of political discussion at the coffee shop in town as long as it is about Wind Turbines and First Nations people. Red necks each and every one of them, not everyone but most, it's like a time warp going back to the 60's I swear.  There have been some good, educational discussions because of the political threads from Global warning to legislation tabled I would have never known about if not for some threads here on OFC. I would have never learned about some important issues because of where I live and socialize. This site and the political threads has helped keep me in the loop. For those few or many that complained to management, I just don't get why they just didn't open the threads and move on.  If anyone wants to watch car wrecks and urinary contests go to CBC or MSN news and read the racist, biased and derogatory comments from fellow Canadians, it is embarrassing to know these people exist. It makes the worse offenders here look like Saints. Plenty of political threads out there as Art pointed out to join, but none with my friends here on OFC.  Owners of OFC, please reconsider your decision. Some of the best decisions I made in my life were those that I changed."
992374,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-22 03:36:00,8243,"C'mon Sir Cranks, spreading hatred and bigotry. Please show me where? Plenty of forums and posts to quote to back up that statement.

I haven't read Arts post yet, or beyond, and I don't consider myself qualified to comment on this site's history and policies. That's fine. One thing for sure is that politics can be very divisive, even among friends and family at times, let alone on an outdoor online forum. How does that line go again?  I do regularly visit OOD forums, and they have an Off Topic, and a Political sub forum. For the most part the political one works ok, but it does lean to the right for sure, as it should be IMO for hunters and fishermen. But there are posters from all over the forums so it can work.  It might be too late now, but I can add this... Make in my Big Chief smokers     It's midnight. I think now I'll catch up with this thread tomorrow. I figure common sense will prevail.  Cheers"

I post about ""Kevin O'Leary declares"", 82 replies.  Then I get slammed for posting ""political"" threads and the funny thing is that the people that are complaining about the ""political threads"" aren't the ones commenting on the fishing related threads.  I don't post to just ""Stir the pot"" as has been implied, when I post on here it's to either help someone or to learn something. Discussing things that are important to me fishing related or not is how I learn. I read all the replies, I learn from listening to other peoples point of views, I don't always agree with them but I learn from them.  I've gone to other ""fishing"" sites in the past but post a question and wait a week and you might get one or two answers. Post a question on here on almost any topic and you'll often have a response within minutes, that's why I've been around here and that's why this site has been around for longer than any other fishing related site.  Fishing is important to me but there is much more in life than just fishing so I'd like to suggest that if fishing is the only thing in your life that is important, go visit the ""fishing only"" sites. If you want to see more fishing related posts on this site then try posting or contributing to posts about fishing instead of whining about NF posts.  And that folks is my $0.02 worth.  "

992102,manitoubass2,2017-01-20 15:14:00,11391,Thats fine. But it actually can be done still on this forum. Just click on it and it takes you to a subsection on the same page.  Many forums have this to keep it streamlined to one page
992105,grimsbylander,2017-01-20 15:18:00,3016,"I post a fishing report ""A perfect day"", 11 replies. I post a fishing related topic ""A trip of a life time"", 28 replies.  I post about ""Kevin O'Leary declares"", 82 replies.  Then I get slammed for posting ""political"" threads and the funny thing is that the people that are complaining about the ""political threads"" aren't the ones commenting on the fishing related threads.  I don't post to just ""Stir the pot"" as has been implied, when I post on here it's to either help someone or to learn something. Discussing things that are important to me fishing related or not is how I learn. I read all the replies, I learn from listening to other peoples point of views, I don't always agree with them but I learn from them.  I've gone to other ""fishing"" sites in the past but post a question and wait a week and you might get one or two answers. Post a question on here on almost any topic and you'll often have a response within minutes, that's why I've been around here and that's why this site has been around for longer than any other fishing related site.  Fishing is important to me but there is much more in life than just fishing so I'd like to suggest that if fishing is the only thing in your life that is important, go visit the ""fishing only"" sites. If you want to see more fishing related posts on this site then try posting or contributing to posts about fishing instead of whining about NF posts.  And that folks is my $0.02 worth.    First of all, I don't believe that using number of replies a thread gets is a way of determining the quality or validity of thread. Especially when comparing two topics of complete difference. While fishing has a finite set of rules and techniques, politics has as many opinions as there are citizens...even more if you consider how many opinions there was by Canadians during the US election. Secondly, we are not generally directly affected by fishing related material whereas politics affects us all, like it or not. Ultimately, I couldn't care less how Joe Blow puts the minnow on his hook. Try upside down   .  Starting a thread about politics is like asking a question with more than one right answer and then being shocked there's 82 replies. As you mentioned, it's usually always the same people posting reports and commenting and political issues....BUT it's usually the same people starting the merry-go-round political threads. Personally, I think you like the attention your threads get. You're a smart enough guy and you've seen enough times how these threads turn out, yet you can't resist firing them up. Hey, until the day comes that politics are off limits, knock yourself out. I don't make the rules so as long as you put NF behind it, you can cause as much controversy as you like."
992108,Dara,2017-01-20 15:23:00,3052,"This is called General Discussion Kinda covers all topics doesn't it? Hunting, fishing, the great outdoors, whatever you like, just keep it clean.  Its pretty easy to see a topic is political and not bother to read it."
992110,grimsbylander,2017-01-20 15:28:00,3016,"Thats fine. But it actually can be done still on this forum. Just click on it and it takes you to a subsection on the same page.  Many forums have this to keep it streamlined to one page  Regardless of whether this forum would benefit from separating fishing from non-fishing, I can tell you from 30 years experience dealing with people and processes...CHANGE is EVIL...good change, bad change, change for the sake of change, whatever...people hate change. It scares them."
992111,manitoubass2,2017-01-20 15:30:00,11391,I agree. It would rock my world to see one extra button on the top off the page???
992112,scugpg,2017-01-20 15:36:00,1373,"Agreed. This keeps coming up and the hot button topics seem to be increasing. What is the harm in creating a separate section for those threads? In addition, if something goes sideways on the general section just move it over there too."
992113,Salmonidstalker,2017-01-20 15:40:00,265,"But if they make a forum for general discussion, there would be very little content in the fishing related section. Lol"
992114,Dara,2017-01-20 15:44:00,3052,"If there is an off topic I think everybody is going to look there anyway just to see if somebody needs trailer or tire help. They may not click on political threads but otherwise no difference. To have a strictly political area..meh, can't see that working real well. Right now there are only a few political threads, people do keep them to a minimum. To have its own area I think we are inviting trouble...either it wouldn't get used or many members would only hang out there and miss a lot of good fishing which is what this forum is all about anyway. We just get a bit distracted waiting for good ice."
992116,grimsbylander,2017-01-20 16:00:00,3016,"Here's my two cents...it has nothing to do with managing extra topic folders and everything to do with the business of the forum. Why is having two folders, fishing and non-fishing, such an issue, when in fact there is already: ODC Team Discussions OFC Team Entries Boats, Motors Fishing Tackle, Miscellaneous, Fishing News, Announcements, Photography, Computer Help, In Memorium, Product Reviews  There isn't ONE folder now!...and a separate folder for product reviews?? LOL The last entry was July 2015!  Personally, I don't care. I suggested it a long time ago and all hell broke loose. But to have 10 topic folders that get relatively little use in comparison to the main Discussion forum and to say we don't like having separate folders is silly. Is having NF topics separate a good idea? Maybe not...maybe having close to half the daily activity based on nothing to do with fishing is bad for business."
992117,AKRISONER,2017-01-20 16:02:00,5558,"cant say i disagree with splitting the NF from the fishing threads. I would like it if the reports that i spent 7 hours making didnt dissapear to the second page within an evening because of a multitude of daily joke and poltiical threads bump it.  Im not hating on these threads because they are appropriately placed in the general discussion tab, but maybe our reports and fishing related questions can be placed somewhere more appropriately? That way people actually see that youve posted a report without having to flip back pages?"
992125,aplumma,2017-01-20 16:37:00,6896,"A sub category would still be something that needs to monitored. people would post stuff in general discussion no matter how many times we chop up the site. Worse yet I will still get the same number of P.M.s about he said she said in nature. We keep them in the same section so we can see them at a glance. We also do not wish to encourage inflammatory threads.  i have been very liberal on letting things run there course but it seems people want to make this a political site and it isn't. We are working on what the new cut off point is for them. The owners are tired of getting hollered at for running a thread to long and running a thread to short if we get hollered at no matter what we do we will choose the easiest path. You all as members have the responsibility to treat the other members with utmost respect at all times the rules are a good guideline. We are not babysitters we are here to organize a place for everyone to feel comfortable and talk about your outdoors life. We could be hardasses and use the ban button but in 4 years I have yet to use it. I as well as the other owners are happy that this site is here it is a memorial to how we met as well as a place where we can talk to our old and new friends. The cure in my opinion is to state your facts in a thread and then listen to the replies. It is not a place to argue, insult or belittle someone into seeing your point. All of the political threads have one thing in common and that is people can't accept someone else's views and that is the reason they are an endangered species. You will find a dozen sites that will let you tear into each other on any subject you want so if that is what you are looking for to get thru the winter then feel free to join one and then once it is out of your system then come here and share a story with your friends here. This site is run in the old fashion way we are about respect, helpfulness and friendship it is what we started with and what we see as our future.  Thanks for reading this  Art"
992126,woodenboater,2017-01-20 16:43:00,2277,haven't checked in lately to see what's up...I wish I was still in Tamarindo  and I shoulda brought some gear but don't have salt water reels for tuna lol
992127,Tjames09,2017-01-20 16:43:00,664,NF forum would be a great idea
992131,woodenboater,2017-01-20 16:48:00,2277,and please don't splinter this site into more sub fora...
