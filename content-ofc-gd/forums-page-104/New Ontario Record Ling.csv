992741,Jds63,2017-01-26 12:53:00,1365,That's amazing !!! But the link isn't working...
992751,ecmilley,2017-01-26 13:51:00,2163,Good job. I think with the recent.intrest in targeting these fish we.may.just see this record fall again
992753,AKRISONER,2017-01-26 13:58:00,5558,"well done man...thats sweet! reminds me of the burbot derbys back in flin flon on athapap. The world record was caught right in front of my cabin, that was subsequently beat by the fishing geeks! who i believe have now lost the world record as well now.  my fishing partner is obsessed with burbots...hes asking for GPS cords lmao"
992756,Terry,2017-01-26 14:19:00,14456,He will not give location. He sent everyone to Johnson Beach so no one would be at his spot.  Lol.
992774,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-26 17:35:00,10439,Nice burbie!!!! There was a giant caught up here earlier this winter too.  
992784,Headhunter,2017-01-26 18:53:00,5703,What a great fish!!!! You could easily tell that buddy was pumped!!!! I can't say on this board what I would do if I had that monster on my line... HH
992818,Joeytier,2017-01-27 00:40:00,3990,Obscenely huge!  Hopefully the certification process goes smooth and your buddy officially becomes the record holder.

993237,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-02 03:33:00,937,What will happen to the fish after everything's done?
993252,AKRISONER,2017-02-02 13:38:00,5558,What will happen to the fish after everything's done?  my guess is taxidermy is the typical way these things go...ive never fully understood the whole requirement to kill the fish when its a record...but whatever i guess their needs to be full 100% certified proof.  It would be cool to have a literal Ontario or WR fish hung up in your cottage.
993265,Terry,2017-02-02 16:18:00,14456,There are catch and release records too. But the catch and keep records are the important ones
993267,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-02 16:37:00,8243,That is one mighty beast. Kudo's to you.  I was told years ago if you buy scallops in a restaurant in North Bay you are probably being served Burbot loin.
