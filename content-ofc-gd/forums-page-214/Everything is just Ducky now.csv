We befriended it withcorn and tried to catch it. No luck the first day. Second day with the net set up and corn as baitJoe caught it. I opened the bill and noticed the jig was in it's tongue. I got my snips and cut off the barbed end of the hook and then back out the jig. Released the duck who stuck around a while and went on it way.We were rewarded with a few carp."

872940,AKRISONER,2014-09-17 16:03:00,5558,And fishermen get a bad name for not caring about nature!  This proves that maybe we are more in tune with nature afterall.
