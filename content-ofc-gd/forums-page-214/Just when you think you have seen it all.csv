872038,chris.brock,2014-09-11 22:28:00,4053,"if he had a Thunder Cat 1000 on the trailer, it would have made more sense, small peanut"

872062,gino,2014-09-12 02:12:00,400,who in right mind would even install a hitch to a Corvette?
872063,SirCranksalot,2014-09-12 02:18:00,3291,"I remember Roger Cannon, the Normark guy, had a hitch on his Mercedes."
872081,Big Cliff,2014-09-12 08:57:00,6899,"I saw that guy coming back out of Snug Harbour Rd. about 5:30 last night but he had a sled on the trailer! Looks funny without it, looked even funnier with a sled sitting on the trailer!"

872086,Reel Man,2014-09-12 10:27:00,80,"And here I thought my Sable was too small to tow a trailer! Silly me, guess I can tow just about anthing...lol"
872106,Terry,2014-09-12 13:23:00,14456,Well.     If I had one vehicle. And wanted to tow something. I too would slap a ball on it and tow.   Why not.  Oh well
873013,nancur373,2014-09-18 00:44:00,1211,Saw a guy on the bog pulling out an 18 footer with a 94 Tercel.
873028,Canuck2fan,2014-09-18 02:17:00,1444,Maybe after the divorce all he/she had left was the vett and sled. How else were they supposed to deliver the sled once they sold it...?  Ultimate towing training vehicle... OF WHAT NOT to do.  
873033,fishindevil,2014-09-18 07:13:00,6254,That's a Darwin Award contestant for sure !!!! That's funny ......
873038,corvette1,2014-09-18 09:30:00,1765,corvette's are all around suv's
873041,nancur373,2014-09-18 12:33:00,1211,How about this...  
873043,Dara,2014-09-18 12:56:00,3052,"Well. If I had one vehicle. And wanted to tow something. I too would slap a ball on it and tow. Why not.  Oh well   Thats what I say too.  Towing cacity is just whatever manufacturer wants to write on there.  There are no real rules or laws on how to determine towing capacity so have at it.  We once had a hitch break off of a 66 chevy impala out in the woods, haywired it back on and it lasted 3 years like that"
