I see there's still lots of good read here and the place looks great like always . I hope every one here who bought new fishing gear and boats this season had a great summer using them and went home with some pb's.  As for me I've slipped back into the 60 & 80 hour a week work thing, kind'a giving it one good last kick and the cat before retirement get's here .  Well like I said , I just popped in and thought I'd say hi . Take care every one and happy fishing ."
