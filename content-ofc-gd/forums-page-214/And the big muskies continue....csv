873076,Fisherpete,2014-09-18 21:18:00,1814,"My last four trips have produced:  Kawarthas - 45"" Kawarthas - 44"" PB tiger muskie Lake of the Woods - 48.5"" followed by a 51"" PB - my first fifty incher St. Lawrence - new PB with a 53.5""  Hit a Kawartha lake last Sunday, was going with John (cowanjo) but a last minute family issue made this a solo mission. Had a follow mid morning, and then caught this pretty girl trolling in the early afternoon... 48"". First time using the new net - Frabill Big Kahuna - absolutely LOVE IT.    Had one other follow and a few other incidental species catches. Haven't had a crazy numbers day yet this year, but I will take quality over quantity any day! I'm going to try hard this fall to put that first Kawartha 50 in my boat... stay tuned!  Pete"
873077,leaf4,2014-09-18 21:27:00,2466,beauty fish thanks for sharing! looks like you've had quite the year
873078,davey buoy,2014-09-18 21:33:00,5505,"Your having quite a year Pete,Another beauty as well.I'm sure you'll get that 50's Kawartha ski real soon!!!WTG!!"
873081,BillM,2014-09-18 21:48:00,17367,"Dude, you're on fire!"
873092,Tom McCutcheon,2014-09-18 22:37:00,627,"I had heard reports, from reliable sources, of a 50 plus fish caught this past weekend on North Pigeon. When I saw the topic Pete, I thought it could be you. Still that is a beauty for the Kawarthas. The 50's are there, just not the numbers like you would find in trophy type waters. As others have said, you and Andrew are on a roll this year."
873094,cowanjo,2014-09-18 22:49:00,249,Pete I would have loved to fish with you I got all the way to end of 407 and had to turn back - my father in law is pretty sick and I appreciate everyone who understands the pressures when this happens.  To Tom - not me recently but if one of my friends told you about the 50plus in north Pigeon last month that is confirmed but maybe there are more I hope!  John
873099,Fisherpete,2014-09-18 23:29:00,1814,"No worries John - family always comes first! I'm sure we will get out again soon enough.  Tom - they are in there for sure, I have seen pics of more 50+ Kawartha skis in the past two years than in the ten before. I certainly think the 44"" minimum size limit they imposed a few years back has helped, as well as improved awareness by anglers. The MCI ""know the difference"" campaign certainly helps.  I'm hoping that when I finally do get my K-50 it will be a nice looking fish - not one that is on it's way out the door... Some of the big ones I have seen were not exactly the sexiest of specimens haha..."

873248,F_ast,2014-09-19 21:35:00,154,Been a hot year for muskies in general.  I have close to 30 in the boat so far this year.  Close to a 3 fish a day average for me this year.  And 3 over 50 this year alone on Kawartha lakes.
