It's like a spin-n-glow but has a flat face so it wiggles like a crankbait...  I'm gunna be trying them for walleye this weekend...  Just wondering if anyone here uses them? What species do you catch on them? How do YOU rig them? Bait or no bait?  I was gunna rig em exactly like a regular worm harness but swap the blade for the wiggle-glo...

873065,Joeytier,2014-09-18 16:45:00,3990,Looks like a kwikfish with a line of beads instead of a body.  Looks like a lake trout and speck killer

873128,Steelheadphycho,2014-09-19 02:45:00,470,That is a real neat pattern. I'm interested in the results. Good luck and keep us posted.
873133,mike rousseau,2014-09-19 04:20:00,4661,"Well in glad you all think they'd be good for trout... Lol..,  Hopefully the walleye feel the same...  Now as far as rigging... Is my set up correct? In your opinions?"
873140,glenner,2014-09-19 10:50:00,56,My buddy has several of those rigeed almost exactly as per your picture and trolls them with a minnow for walleye with good success. Been meaning to try them myself.
