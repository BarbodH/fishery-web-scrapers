872785,TJQ,2014-09-16 18:56:00,7806,"Well with most of the work done, it was time for a little vacation, that we had promised our friends Joe and Jamie, last year.  It was supposed to happen in early June.. but we were . well a bit delayed by the destruction of the camp.  So after a long summer of rebuilding we finally got a bit of R&R time and got to treat them to the full Jiggy.  lol  We started off with a day long ATV ride to some of my favorite spots, especially a lookout that nobody goes into... a bit of a hike but well worth the quick climb..    That night we had a most wonderful moon    Next day it was time for a bit of fishing.  We caught quite a few and then had something Ive seen before happened...   but is pretty rare.        We were in some deeper water.... something I usually troll over just to get to the next good spot, when WHAM Monique (of course)  gets a nice one on.. well she wheels it in and its a medium sized pike with a HAWG hanging off the side of it in its mouth!!!   I've seen this before but never with a big one.. lol...        Back into the river it went... but the smaller one had a good chunk outta it so .. that was gonna be our appetizer that night!    We don't go 200 feet and WHAM!!  She gets another one!!!    And back from whence she/he came!!    Jamie had never cleaned a fish before... so I figured the best first on would be a nice slimy bony pike hahahahaha!!!!    The next day it was time to finally put the woodstove in... the last of the jobs before I could proclaim the rebuilding complete for this year.  Im no carpenter so I oversaw Joes work..  When asked if i wanted to do the honours and cut the hole in the roof.. I quickly used the standard ""I gotta go to the bathroom"" break excuse... lol      TADA!!!    Now we can get ready for... gulp... hunting???"
