The bite has been hot the last couple of weeks.  Slip bobber has been deadly as has the jig.  Here are some videos from the last 2 weeks of 'walking the dog'         "

Really cool seeing the pike taking your walleye and not just once either!   Instead of a flyin trip Joe, maybe we should just camp on Simon's front lawn."
