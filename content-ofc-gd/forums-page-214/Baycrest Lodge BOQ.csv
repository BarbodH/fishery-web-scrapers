872998,bobowski,2014-09-17 23:06:00,360,Does anyone now if they are open for ice fishing this year? I've been trying to get a hold of them for a couple of days with no success. Do they have an email address or phone # only. I have heard good things about this place and am looking to plan a trip up there this winter. Thanks
