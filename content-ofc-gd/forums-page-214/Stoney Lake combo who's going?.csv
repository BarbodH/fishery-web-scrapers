872007,e-z-out,2014-09-11 19:45:00,1052,Next weekend is the annual Stoney lake combo and wanted to know who's going.  All the best to all the teams see you guys there.
872008,jimmer,2014-09-11 19:57:00,2730,Do you still see walleye being weighed in during that tournament?
872009,e-z-out,2014-09-11 20:05:00,1052,Yes but no big numbers
872186,Jer,2014-09-12 21:58:00,1426,How would you weigh in with walleye? Anything worth weighing would be well over the keep slot.
872197,e-z-out,2014-09-12 23:08:00,1052,Take a look at last year's results http://www.stoneylakecombo.com/results.html
872198,Steve,2014-09-12 23:12:00,2075,"Jer, it's only in the title.  no one really weighs in any walleye.  edit: i see the previous years are posted. You can see what I mean."
872203,Garnet,2014-09-12 23:55:00,2056,I weight a max length walleye in a tournament on Rice at 2.65 and max length walleye on Sturgeon are 3-3.10  so yes walleye are still good at the Stony Combo.
872204,misfish,2014-09-12 23:58:00,29133,Good luck Bro. J
872208,e-z-out,2014-09-13 00:21:00,1052,Going to give it a go and see what I come up with. It's 3 days of fishing so I'm happy
872209,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-13 00:24:00,8243,"Not being a tourney guy what is a combo, 2 fish Bass and Pics or ? What do the numbers represent? Pounds, grams. length? The chart isn't clear on my laptop. I like to learn something about fishing whenever I can. I fish a few charity Walleye tournaments here on Erie every summer, lately the trend seems to have the largest Perch as a bonus prize. Lets the guys that can't get out 10 miles or more on big water participate.  Thanks. JD."
872212,e-z-out,2014-09-13 00:44:00,1052,This might help J.D  http://www.stoneylakecombo.com/rules.html
873088,e-z-out,2014-09-18 22:07:00,1052,Well good luck to all that are going to this tournament. Will see you guys on the water.
873418,lew,2014-09-21 13:48:00,12766,"Been lots of boats running around this morning, but I just saw a big bolt of lightning over Stoney/Clear lakes so hopefully all the tourney guys are paying attention."
873455,e-z-out,2014-09-21 22:17:00,1052,It was a hard day with the rain. Called it quits by 11am. From what I hear David Chong was in first place.
873516,jimmer,2014-09-22 13:38:00,2730,What a crazy weekend to be fishing in a tournament. Hope everyone was safe.
873517,e-z-out,2014-09-22 13:41:00,1052,We all played it safe but some stayed out till the end. Other's came in with what they had by 11am
873519,e-z-out,2014-09-22 13:44:00,1052,By the way it was nice seeing you again Lew always a pleasure talking to you. Thanks for the invite for coffee but we ended up hitting the water.
873520,lew,2014-09-22 13:44:00,12766,Good yakking with you on Friday too Jose  Coffee pots always on next time your up this way.
873521,mike rousseau,2014-09-22 13:47:00,4661,Our local combo tourney you are REQUIRED to weigh in 1 bass and 1 walleye or you can't weigh... 2 fish total...  So even if you get a giant walleye... If you don't weigh a bass you can't weigh... And vise versa...  That being said our area would actually be pretty even between the bass guys and walleye guys cause we have no slot...
873528,e-z-out,2014-09-22 14:11:00,1052, I like the sounds of that Mike. When is that tournament?   Lew next time I will definitely stop bye and have that coffee with you.
873534,mike rousseau,2014-09-22 14:47:00,4661,It's held in late July every year... Me and my buddy took 1st this year... 10lbs 2oz.... 1 bass 1 walleye...
873536,SmokestackLightnin,2014-09-22 14:51:00,390,It was a hard day with the rain. Called it quits by 11am. From what I hear David Chong was in first place. Dave and his partner came in third
