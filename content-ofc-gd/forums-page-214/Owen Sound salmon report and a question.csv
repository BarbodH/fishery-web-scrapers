We've been getting on average 2-3 salmon in the last couple hours before sun down.  All fish have been shallow (50-80ft of water, down 20-40 ft).  It's just starting to slow down now.  Last night was the first night in a couple weeks that I didn't get a salmon in the boat (just two small bows).  Attached is a pic of my little guy with his first two salmon.  That was exciting.  Also a question for the forum:  I have a small kicker on my boat, but in a decent chop, it steers like crap.  The last couple times out I've ended up trolling with my 115 Yamaha 4 stroke.  I don't plan on doing it often, but are there any major concerns with trolling with the big motor?  Obviously it's not geared to run at 2mph for hours on end, but do I risk any permanent damage?  Thanks! "

873172,AKRISONER,2014-09-19 15:26:00,5558,wow i am encouraged by seeing that there are salmon that are alive in GB still. I thought they were all dead by now.

873193,CRUD150,2014-09-19 18:18:00,87,Really? Acutually you were right. Those two in his pic. were the last two.
