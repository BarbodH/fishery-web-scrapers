I'm above the dam at Rolphton and I've fished at the mouth of the Demoine river and Duexs Rivers.  I've had a little more success below the dam at the Swisha and points between Swisha and Deep River.  Caught several small walleye, sauger, and smallmouth. A couple of pike were in the mix as well.   I figure an un-pressured fishery should be much better than it is....  TIA.  Patrick."

Unfortunately, I didn't have any luck, besides losing a few lures.  I saw a few people fishing as well, but didn't see them bring anything to their boat. It was really weirdâ€¦rocky shoals, tea stained waters, and lots of drop offs (according to Navionics), but I didn't come across any fish at all. Not even any sunfish, perch, minnows, rock bass, anything, except two carp.  Hope you'll have better luck than I did for those two days. This was back in July and the mosquitoes were out in full force too."
