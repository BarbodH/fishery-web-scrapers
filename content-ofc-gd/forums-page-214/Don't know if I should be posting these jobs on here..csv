872770,Big Cliff,2014-09-16 17:41:00,6899,It just seems to me that a lot of our members have backgrounds in wildlife management and related fields and when I see opportunities like these I feel that they might get missed so I post them. Unfortunatly I have never heard of any of our members landing one of them.  http://www.kawarthaconservation.com/resources/opportunities.html  I realize that these are contract positions but I have several friends that started out on contract and ended up with full time jobs.  Hope this helps someone on here!
