873443,Rod Caster,2014-09-21 20:38:00,5784,"Joey Tier and I and two other pals went into ZEC Restigo for a three day, two night, lightly-packed trip. We purchased our non-resident papers, got some of that deliciously well-priced Quebec beer and drove into the first of three lakes we'd hit that weekend. The weather was great the first day, horrible the next and good again the third. On the third morning I was chipping ice off of my gear when I started breakfast. Trucks got scratched, we got wet, tents had ice and we all caught fish.  Day one, we tried for lake trout and got about 20 between the group. We had a great fish dinner that night.     Day two we went a lake for bigger lakers and specs. We only lasted a few hours before we had enough of the cold, wind and rain. I got one small spec and that was it. We decided to travel to lake #3 in the dreary weather. By the evening it cleared up a bit and we nailed a good dozen pickeral, all small, but all blue!   That night the weather relaxed and it was cold, super calm, super clear and bright with moonlight. It all made for great photos in the morning.     That day we got into some decent walleye numbers and fat pike; in particular, Joey got the nicest fish of the weekend with a 35+ inch pike     Weather played a big role in the numbers of fish that were caught, but it was still a worthwhile expedition.  Speaking of weather, frost killed my garden so I'm sitting on 30+ pounds of green tomotoes. We are making salsa verde and chow chow right now. We got tons of beans, peas, spinnach, parsley and 6 large pumpkins, as well as a ridiculous amount of tomotoes. Not bad for our first gardening season. Here is a pic from the garden I took one nice morning.    Also got some geese for dinner. Marinating now and getting cooked tonight.    and....the little is cuuuute   "
