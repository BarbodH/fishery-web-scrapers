872563,gino,2014-09-15 01:53:00,400,sweet! nice stretch of the creek you got there...enjoy!
872568,Joeytier,2014-09-15 02:37:00,3990,Nice job!  What do you mean by hybrid?
872573,davey buoy,2014-09-15 07:58:00,5505,"Agreed,what I nice spot you have there!!! Some nice fish!"
872577,BillM,2014-09-15 11:48:00,17367,Some nice coho there.   Although it would be a good idea to try and not let those fish flop around in the mud    Keep that spot under your hat!
872623,BowSlayer101,2014-09-15 15:14:00,296,"thanks guys, ya ill keep them in the water next time, the cohos are just so jumpy, hard to control."
872657,beenfishing,2014-09-15 21:48:00,21,Nice fish! What kind of bait/lures were you using? I've just started fishing for trout.
872659,moxie,2014-09-15 22:27:00,1566,Good goin'. Only downside of them hitting the rivers is knowing winter is around the corner but thanks for sharing.
872801,BowSlayer101,2014-09-16 20:52:00,296,"thanks for the kind words and yep winter is coming! haha, laker time soon! Also i used mostly spinners but roe, spoons and flies all worked too."
