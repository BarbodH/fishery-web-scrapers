873079,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-18 21:37:00,8243,"I have a Wesbar tail light and the bulb needs to be changed. I found what looks to be a sealed unit inside where the bulbs are housed. No way can I get that apart.  Question, do I need to change the entire unit that Wesbar does sell. Of course I need it done asap as we are heading north in a week.  Thanks in advance,  Johnny D"
873082,BillM,2014-09-18 21:50:00,17367,"If they fit, get the submersible LED units from Princess Auto.  I've converted both our boat trailer and our utility trailer to them.  Absolutely great units for the price (When they go on sale).  Even the mounting holes were the same as what came on both trailers."
873084,lew,2014-09-18 21:54:00,12766,I had the same lights on another trailer and when one burnt out I did the same as Bill & changed everything over to LED
873085,misfish,2014-09-18 21:59:00,29133,YUP ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Did it for all my trailers.
873089,Wagoneer,2014-09-18 22:19:00,118,LED units are almost the same as normal ones now so it's a no brainer. Plus they last forever.  I've done both my dads boat trailer and my own.  They're also a lot safer as they're at least twice as bright. Make sure your grounds are all in good order as LED's are sensitive to need a good ground or they'll flicker or won't turn on at all.
