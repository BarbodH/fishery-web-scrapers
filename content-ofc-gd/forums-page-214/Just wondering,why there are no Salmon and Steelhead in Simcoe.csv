873320,Steve,2014-09-20 16:07:00,2075,"correct me if I'm wrong but the Atlantics we have aren't native either, because the Atlantics we are stocking are not from native brood stock?  I believe the Atlantics are from a non native strain?"
873345,fishnguy,2014-09-20 18:18:00,96," If they weren't stocked they won't be in there.  What lakes other then the great lakes are salmon and steelhead in? Trout Lake in North Bay area has landlocked salmon or ""Ouananiches"".  Not sure the history of how they got there.  EDIT:  I see from reading page 2 that I am late to the conversation.  Oops."
873362,Freshtrax,2014-09-20 19:55:00,2215,I wouldn't be the least bit upset if a buch of chinines ended up in simcoe.
873369,davey buoy,2014-09-20 21:13:00,5505,"Imagine the lake full of Salmon,Steelhead,and of course Lakers and Whitefish??. Doesn't hurt to dream lol."

873191,davey buoy,2014-09-19 18:08:00,5505,"Question I have thought about lately. I think the lake is big enough to support that?. Maybe something to do with descent size rivers for them to spawn?. Surely deep enough,lots of bait fish.What are your thoughts on this?,would be interested to know why."
873194,Joeytier,2014-09-19 18:20:00,3990,Native species take precedent over introduced species for recreational purpose in most cases.
873195,davey buoy,2014-09-19 18:23:00,5505,"Native species take precedent over introduced species for recreational purpose in most cases. Ok,but why can't they live there,say hundreds of years ago before stocking ?"
873200,Terry,2014-09-19 18:35:00,14456,"there use to be steelhead in simcoe, till 1800s  I think they built a gristmill that blocked a river and they had nowhere to spawn you still hear the odd one caught and the odd brown, but icefishing   steelhead would be a blast on simcoe"
873203,misfish,2014-09-19 18:40:00,29133,There are rainbows in the lake still. Just no one targets them as their numbers are not that great. I caught a spawned out one years back on a small trib.

Maybe a good river is the problem as you mentioned."
873208,BillM,2014-09-19 19:07:00,17367,Definitely no spawning grounds off Simcoe that would sustain a steelhead population.  Any of the rainbows or brookies you get in there are residents for sure.

873210,BillM,2014-09-19 19:13:00,17367,"Residents as in, they most likely came from one of the many streams that flow into Simcoe.  It would be cool to think they spawn in those tiny creeks but spend their time out in Simcoe chowing down on smelt, lol."
873213,davey buoy,2014-09-19 19:20:00,5505,"Interesting,do you think the lack of Salmon is similar to the few steelies in the lake?. Or is that a complete different thing?."

Thanks Bill - you just answered a question G asked me last week  I didn't have an answer for "":Dad - How come the lakers don't run the rivers?""

873286,Gallie,2014-09-20 11:25:00,1215,When i was i kid i hooked an 11 lb rainbow in the river that runs through washago to the old grist mill. Nobody could believe what it was but it was a pretty cool experiance for me. Up till i started fishing lake ontario it remained my pb too.
873287,FloatnFly,2014-09-20 11:44:00,1640,"there are cases of landlocked salmon, but they are different than the monster chinnies, chinnooks would overrun simcoe pretty easily, they swim laps around lake ontario until spawn time.  but simcoe could definitely support a resident trout population, would be pretty cool to have a still water trout fishery there, i know there are other still water trout lakes in ontario"

873303,MJL,2014-09-20 13:47:00,2427,"Keep in mind that the only salmon and trout/char native to Ontario are landlocked Atlantics, lakers and brookies. Steelhead and pacific salmon (chinooks, coho, pinks) are only native to the rivers west of the rockies and wouldn't have naturally occurred in lakes/rivers here prior to the 1800s.  Could a naturally self-sustaining population of steelhead or salmon exist in Lake Simcoe today? TBH I'm not sure but a whole lot of habitat restoration would likely need to occur to improve water quality, temperature and remove dams so that fish could access the coldwater stretches of the tributaries to spawn. Then there's the MNR's stance on introducing non-native fish to new bodies of water...  trout lake in northbay, landlocked atlantics that are actually self sustaining  According to this article, the landlocked salmon were first introduced to the lake in 1935 through stocking. Unfortunately a chemical spill in 1967 in their primary spawning creek pretty much wiped out that population until further re-stocking in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1994 and 1995. It is pretty cool that we have a self-sustaining population of Ouananiche here in Ontario.  http://www.afs-oc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Fitchko1996.pdf"
873313,Rod Caster,2014-09-20 15:26:00,5784,"You got it MJL. It's the only inland, non-great lake in Ontario with a self-sustaining Atlantic Salmon population. The main spawing creek (Four Mile Creek) is a fish sanctuary year-round (and actually enforced during the smelt run now) and the fishing season is only one week per year. Even the lake trout are closed except for one week per year to ensure that the Salmon are not by-caught. There are tons of healthy lakers in that lake.  To me it's actually a shame that they don't continue stocking the lake with Atlantics to actually create a fishery, or just give up on the program, because the bi-product has been the waste of a fantastic lake trout fishery.  Anyway, back on topic, not sure if anyone has actually mentioned it here, but other than Atlantics, lakers and specks, all the other char/trout/salmon species are non-native to Ontario. So, if there are no connecting waterways to the great lakes, and Simcoe is no longer stocked, that is your reason why it has no Rainbows/Salmon."
