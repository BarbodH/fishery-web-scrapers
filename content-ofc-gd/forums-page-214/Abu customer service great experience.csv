873239,JoshS,2014-09-19 21:17:00,729,I wanted to give a shout out to Abu Garcia's customer service. I sent in a burnt out C3 6500 to their service center in Iowa and wrote on the reel repair form asking them to please contact me prior to fixing anything with the repair costs because I wanted to make sure it was worth it to fix the thing.  I got home from fishing last night to a package from Iowa with a brand new reel in it. They just sent me a replacement no questions asked!! They even put on a new power handle because I had one on the reel I sent in.  First time dealing with Abu for me. That's some great service!
