873302,mistaredone,2014-09-20 13:24:00,913,Great info. It's tempting me to grab my fly rod and head out on a weekday.  Do the crowed die down after the samlon spawn?

Spawning Chinook don't generally eat much, but do strike at reaction type lures like a flatfish/kwikfish/etc running in the current near them.  Doug"

And HANG ON for the strike!  Doug  Now your talking Doug.  It was a rush when that strike came. I dont recall ever missing a hit. When they grabbed it,it was a fight til the end. Straighten hook or break off was the only way I lost one. Back then,there was respect for all anglers to pull up.  I always have a kwik in my sack. Salmon or bows. I find a deep moving pool,I throw it on for a go."
