873218,creditmaster,2014-09-19 19:35:00,190,Hey guys someone please hep me i need to know when to start fishing for steelhead. i live on the credit river near mississauga and also what to use (i can float jig and fly) fish
873219,Brettiop,2014-09-19 19:44:00,279,"Start now!  And use roe under a float, obviously many other options, but roe is hard to beat....its why they are there"
873221,creditmaster,2014-09-19 20:01:00,190,they also spawn in fall? i thought they only spawned in spring?
873224,Brettiop,2014-09-19 20:18:00,279,"They do spawn in the spring, some will spawn in the fall also but not many.  The eggs from the salmon which are spawning now are what the trout are gorging on."
873228,creditmaster,2014-09-19 20:35:00,190,ok waht about jigs?
873232,BillM,2014-09-19 20:43:00,17367,"Sure jigs work, beads, everything it's still early...  Go fish."
