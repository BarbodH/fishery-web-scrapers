872155,creditmaster,2014-09-12 19:37:00,190,Hey guys I am wondering if seatrout and steelhead are the same? if not please tell me the diffrence
872156,BillM,2014-09-12 19:39:00,17367,"No, completely different.   Sea trout is a salt water fish, also in a completely different family.   To make things even more confusing they called sea trout 'speckled trout' as well.   Always gets a laugh out of me when I'm fishing down in Florida."
872157,creditmaster,2014-09-12 19:40:00,190,oh?  cuz some people call browns speckeld trout also
872159,BillM,2014-09-12 19:41:00,17367,"oh?  cuz some people call browns speckeld trout also  They shouldn't be... Brown trout are brown trout, speckled trout are speckled trout (or otherwise known as brook trout)"
872160,creditmaster,2014-09-12 19:42:00,190,ok so brook trout are the same as these sea trout?
872161,BillM,2014-09-12 19:45:00,17367,ok so brook trout are the same as these sea trout?  No..  Sea trout is a sea trout.  It's a warm water salt water species..  It shares it's name with the fresh water speckled trout (or brook trout) but is in a completely different family and not related at all.  Only thing similar is the name.
872162,Sinker,2014-09-12 19:49:00,8692,"On the east coast we catch sea run brook and brown trout that the locals call sea trout, but they are still browns and speckle trout.....if that makes any sense lol. They live in the salt water, and come to fresh water to spawn.    S."
872163,BillM,2014-09-12 19:52:00,17367,"On the east coast we catch sea run brook and brown trout that the locals call sea trout, but they are still browns and speckle trout.....if that makes any sense lol. They live in the salt water, and come to fresh water to spawn.    S.  We haven't even mentioned yet that brook trout is actually a char and not a trout at all, lol   I've heard of some of those monster sea run browns they get on the east coast (Mostly caught in the middle of the night if I'm not mistaken)..   That sounds like a fun little fishery."
872164,blaque,2014-09-12 19:56:00,2419,Whos on first? Whats on second? and I dunno's on third?
872166,jimmer,2014-09-12 20:05:00,2730,"Aren't sea run rainbows and specks the same as the fresh water ones, just adapted to salt water? Have you seen the salmon they catch in Australia? They don't look like salmon."
872168,creditmaster,2014-09-12 20:08:00,190,"On the east coast we catch sea run brook and brown trout that the locals call sea trout, but they are still browns and speckle trout.....if that makes any sense lol.

872169,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-12 20:14:00,8243,"You wouldn't want to lip a saltwater trout. I have caught and eaten them in Fla. out of brackish water. The taste and texture is similar to Rainbow Trout. Very easy to catch, casting float, line with split shot, 4 feet or so, and a live shrimp hooked behind the brain."
872170,BillM,2014-09-12 20:16:00,17367,Those two 'fangs' they have would leave you with a few holes in your fingers that's for sure.   When I'm down there I use Docs Goofy jigs and half a shrimp.  Bomb it out there and rip it back as fast as I can.  Lots and lots of fun.
872172,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-12 20:28:00,8243,"Thanks Bill will need to try that in November, sounds fun."
872174,BillM,2014-09-12 20:33:00,17367,"Thanks Bill will need to try that in November, sounds fun.  It is!  Here's their website.  I run both types (feather and without) and they both work great.  All kinds of other stuff on them as well as you can imagine.  http://www.docsgoofyjigs.com/Pages/default.aspx"
872179,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-12 21:08:00,8243,"Bill they look neat. I can't see why they wouldn't work here tipped with a worm or minnow for anything that would hit a jig, thanks. I'll try Fishin Franks in Port Charlotte If he hasn't have them no one does.  Sorry about the hi jack Creditmaster."
872180,creditmaster,2014-09-12 21:15:00,190,no prop u guys anserewd my question
872223,Spiel,2014-09-13 03:02:00,9065,"Sea Trout, a name often used for anadromous Brown Trout.  http://www.wildtrout.org/content/sea-trout  They do get big.....  http://www.wherewisemenfish.com/_Argentina_Rio_Grande_Villa_Maria  Not to be confused with Spotted Seatrout."
872236,FloatnFly,2014-09-13 11:32:00,1640,"the spotted sea trout which is also called a speckled trout, looks like a vampire check this out  browns are browns  and to make things really confusing, brook trout aren't actually trout, they're char....  and you obviously know what steelhead are, which are also called rainbow trout, but some will say rainbow trout are purely resident fish and aren't a steelhead.......so much confusion!"
872247,BillM,2014-09-13 14:29:00,17367,This thread really makes me want to get back down to Clearwater for some salt water action.
872665,Canuck,2014-09-15 22:55:00,491,"Total thread highjack now, but i did a Spanish Mackerel and Sea Trout charter in Tampa Bay .  Non stop action  every cast  it was crazy"
