872123,Beans,2014-09-12 15:44:00,3339,"WOW...What a trip !!!  I got dizzy watching the video...  Glad to hear you got the ""all clear"" on your tests...  I hope I get the same results on Thursday..."
872446,cram,2014-09-14 15:41:00,1733,Wow.  Looks like an amazing trip..  Good for you and your dad.
872503,Spiel,2014-09-14 20:12:00,9065,Way cool my young friend. I'm so very pleased you and your Father were able to pull off such a magnificent and grossly huge trip.  I hope you will share more pictures with us when you've had time to sort through them all.
872620,MJL,2014-09-15 14:55:00,2427,"Thanks again guys  Stunning pics, great video and a kick ass trip! Those coastal roads look WAAAAY too fun to drive on! Tons of twisty bits and awesome views Thanks for sharing, and congrats on your anniversary!  The sturgeon fishing was my #1 highlight of the trip but my #2 highlight was driving the roads from Kamloops to Whistler. The drive was incredible and one I would love to do again (maybe with a smaller sports car ). It was full of curves through the mountains and along rivers.  Glad your feeling well. Looks like you had a great trip Is that Fraser Cr with your Dad? The video is excellent I hope you don't mind if I share it.  Hey Brad, feel free to share the vid if you want.  We hired STS Guiding for the guide and it was super fun. Already planning another trip to hopefully catch one bigger than me.LOL  Great trip Mike! I did the same thing in June, minus the fishing part!! I'm jealous! Great road trip though, eh? Amazing country we have here, and so much more to see!! Photos are awesome, as always! Thanks for sharing!The best part of this whole thread is your clean bill of health! Congrats on that battle man!!!!!S.  Amazing indeed. At the moment we're thinking of doing another one except to the east coast. I'd like to try my hand at fishing for stripers, sea run brookies, mackerel and cod.  If I had to drive across the prairies, I won't make the mistake of bringing only 1 CD though.LOL  Great news on your health and what a photo-journey  Ya did it up right  People miss so much when flying ---and I know it's mostly about time  But the most important thing you will always be able to reflect upon-----You took that time  PS---I liked the prairies---especially at night-----Lights shine like Islands in seas of wheat and canola fields  We only drove during the day throughout our whole trip. We ended up driving between 6-10hrs per day. We weren't too fond of hitting deer, moose, elk, pronghorn (which truckers told us about in the US).LOL  Unfortunately on the drive between Whistler and Vancouver, a rock cracked our windshield. The crack is bigger than a loonie and the glass repair place recommended we replace the whole thing.  Way cool my young friend. I'm so very pleased you and your Father were able to pull off such a magnificent and grossly huge trip.  I hope you will share more pictures with us when you've had time to sort through them all.  I've got a ton more pictures to sort through. Only a few time lapses though - In California and a few other states, it's illegal to have windshield mounted devices (like GPS)...Plus the bugs crashing into our windshield were insanely bad.LOL  After Vancouver we drove through Washington, Oregon, California (Redwood forests and Yosemite National Park), Las Vegas, Grand Canyon (north rim), utah Colorado (along the Colorado river), Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and then home.  In Oregon, it's illegal to pump your own gas"

872050,MJL,2014-09-12 00:32:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you enjoyed the vid and pics  On this trip I took a total of approximately 487,000 pictures (mostly time lapse) using 2 GoPro Hero 3+ and a few DSLR cameras (Between my dad and I we had 4). We were definitely geared up to document the trip.LOL  What an eye you have MJ. Beautiful. What an experience with your Dad. If I remember you were ill. How are you feeling? better I hope?  It's a trip my dad always wanted to do. I bought other provincial licenses to fish along the way so I was up for the drive and the fishing.LOL  Back at the beginning of July, I got news that my CT scans, X-rays, bone scans and blood tests were clear (aside from a few fractured ribs - not sure how that happened) and I celebrated my 1-year cancer free anniversary by buying a new camera & lens  Feeling great and I hope to be out a lot more.  Cheers  Mike"
