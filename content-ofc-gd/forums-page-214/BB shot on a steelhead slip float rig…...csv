I'm planning on some fall river action in the weeks ahead and I will be trying roe sacks, Berkeley Power grub, and trout jigs.  I want to make sure I'm getting down far enough but I also don't want to overdo it.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated."
873226,Brettiop,2014-09-19 20:23:00,279,"It all depends on the size of your float/river current/river depth...  You want enough so your float is properly cocked, but not so much that it starts to drag it under water.  make sure you get split shot all the wey down to about 1-2' from your bait, a lot of new steelhead fisherman don't get there bait down deep enough....heavy current and ill sometimes put 3-4 aplit shots about 6"" from my bait. Get it down and keep it down."

873231,BillM,2014-09-19 20:42:00,17367,Depends on the float size.  I don't bulk shot unless I'm fishing fast water..
