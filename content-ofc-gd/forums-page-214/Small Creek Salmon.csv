872757,MJL,2014-09-16 16:41:00,2427,Very nice Jon...Looking forward to getting out this week to take some photos like that. Hopefully the fish won't spook when they see a big bright orange camera swimming towards them.LOL

872775,Jon,2014-09-16 18:00:00,209,Mike:  Some fish are not too spooky and don't move but the majority are pretty jittery when I put the GoPro in front of them. I tried covering up the lights on the front and that may have helped but I really think that they easily see the camera and move away or there is some sort of an electric field generated by the camera that they sense and move away. Best thing to do (if you can) is put the camera somewhere and let it sit. I also put the camera on a pole rather than trying to hand-hold the camera.  Here are the pics I took that day. The underwater ones are from the GoPro taken on a 0.5s time delay. Not up to your standards but tough to get clear pics when there are a pile of large chinnys stirring up the bottom!  https://www.flickr.com/photos/91080279@N05/sets/72157647622313212/  Jon

873012,tbaltovski,2014-09-18 00:41:00,38,very cool.  You get to appreciate how strong they are - barely even moving to stay in that fast moving water. Unlike that little rainbow. Great video!
