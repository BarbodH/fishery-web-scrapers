I will be living in my parents' apartment so I won't be renting a lodge (I can't even afford one ). I have been there a few other times for some fishing action and was able to land four smallmouth bass but other than that nada!  Since I am fairly new to the area I was hoping to get a few pointers on places I could try fishing. The most important thing is that I will be fishing with my parents and so a place that is easily accessible by road would be best. I realize that there are alot of small lakes there but it would be hard to get to, lets say, Young Lake with my parents because they won't be able to walk such long distances. I have tried Gull Lake, Larder Lake marina, and Culver park so if there are any other suggestions then that would be awesome.  Please don't think I am asking for any honey holes or anything like that because that is not my purpose. Just the name of a easy access lake would be nice so I can spend an afternoon fishing with family!"
