872769,bassinator,2014-09-16 17:40:00,32,What is the walleye/steelhead fishing like in the Erieau area this time of year. I know you can get great numbers on Lake Erie during the late summer but was wondering if it is still good now and through the fall for steelhead? Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Jeff
