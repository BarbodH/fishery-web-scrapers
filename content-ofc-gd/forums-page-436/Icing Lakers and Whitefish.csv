669048,trapshooter,2012-02-23 02:30:00,1234,"Been putting some time into chasing lakers and whitefish.  My buddy Mike from Kenora came over for a trip.  Overall we did pretty well, not huge numbers but quality fish.   I'm just going to let the pictures roll.....                This next fish was the highlight of my trip, maybe my season.  It's not massive big, but a real nice fish... great fight and I really like how the pics turned out... so I'm posting 3 pics of the same fish.        It hit a lindy darter about 5 mins after I tied it on and dropped it down.     I think Mike was most impressed with this Ling.          Overall it has been a great season on the ice.  March is usually the best month, so lots of ice fishing to look forward to yet!"
669058,danc,2012-02-23 03:07:00,4677,Sweet report as usual Ben. All I know for sure is that the fish aren't biting at the OPP construction site in Dryden
669060,trapshooter,2012-02-23 03:09:00,1234,"Well Dan, the good news is that you wouldn't have to travel very far!!"
669068,Jet,2012-02-23 03:59:00,364,Beauty Lakers all around! I totally get what you're saying about the Laker that wasn't the biggest but most impressive. I felt the same way after landing a larger sized laker outside of Simcoe. I've caught bigger in Simcoe but that one was much more memorable.
669075,spincast,2012-02-23 10:31:00,3279,Great report - those lakers are beauties
669077,fishindevil,2012-02-23 11:07:00,6254,"WOW !!!!! some real nice quality fish as usual ben !!! some real fat white fish,man they look so healthy as do the lakers !!!"
669090,Roy,2012-02-23 12:10:00,13728,"Fantastic report! Great pictures too! You're making me sick, Ben."
669092,solopaddler,2012-02-23 12:24:00,8605,"Ben, no kidding, those photos are stunning! What a gorgeous bunch of fish.  One day I'm coming up there in the winter!"
669096,limeyangler,2012-02-23 12:51:00,5204,"Nice Ben.....real nice. I hope we can half way emulate that on Monday. If you were at Bull did you try any of those new depth contours? I dont have a GPS so its a bit hit and miss for me...just wondering,"
669102,johnnyb,2012-02-23 13:14:00,3413,I always have to take a deep breath and brace myself before clicking on your posts....WOW...you never disappoint.  Stunning fish man...thanks for sharing!
669104,BillM,2012-02-23 13:35:00,17367,"Ben, awesome as usual!"

669115,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-23 14:53:00,2690,"Breathtakingly beautiful!!!  Absolutely love the shot of your ""fave"" laker about to go nose first down the hole"
669116,Harrison,2012-02-23 14:56:00,2202,"Awesome, great shots Ben.  You live in paradise."
669156,troutologist,2012-02-23 16:29:00,951,Those whiteys are cannons!!  As always nice fish!  Man we need to trade a couple of trips soon.
669238,Joeytier,2012-02-23 20:25:00,3990,"I can't get over just how many truly huge fish you are pulling in up there.  Fish of a lifetime for many, each one of them.  You must just be lucky."

669464,trapshooter,2012-02-24 13:46:00,1234,Thanks everyone.   Hey Simon - yeah a few of those trout are from there.  The only other spot I tried is along that shoreline where I talked to you back in early January.  Went there twice and caught 4 lakers and a couple wf.  35 fow.  I need to get in there this spring/summer with a boat/graph and handheld GPS!!
669754,MJL,2012-02-25 02:58:00,2427,Awesome stuff Ben  The ling looks so nifty...Like a sausage.LOL
669848,TDunn,2012-02-25 17:39:00,680,Now those are lakers! Nice fish Ben!  TDunn
669852,limeyangler,2012-02-25 17:58:00,5204, I've trying to convince people i know with smaller boats to sail down the creek in there for years...so far no takers...lol.  Do you know if the camp would let you use their launch?
670035,trapshooter,2012-02-26 14:22:00,1234," I have heard that he doesn't.  So you need a boat small enough to hand-bomb into the creek.  Apparently our friend, Mr. Greenpants, has permission for the camp launch though!"
670554,LeXXington,2012-02-28 01:10:00,1928,"Wow, very nice pics  Thanks for sharing"
