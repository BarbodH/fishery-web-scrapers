669918,Bluegill,2012-02-26 00:22:00,197,Do you have any recommendations? Anything I have to be aware off?
669919,captpierre,2012-02-26 00:36:00,2521,"I bought a small entry level electric unit.  Only smokes for less than 30 min -then have to reload sawdust. A joke.  if you are serious, get a good one that self loads."
669927,Fisherman,2012-02-26 01:06:00,7201,"All depends what you plan on using it for.  I have the basic electric front door model, 2 grills with the pan underneath for wood chips.  That smoker has probably done a 1000 pounds of fish over the years, mostly salmon.  On an average load, I have only needed to put in 3 pans of chips, sometimes only 2 if it was a smaller amount of meat.  One thing I changed out over the years were the grills, got replacement porcelain coated ones for a BBQ.  Easier to clean and almost sticky free."

669981,Twocoda,2012-02-26 04:27:00,4130,the downfall to the lighter units is keeping a consistent temp during the winter....last fall i retired my true north unit that served me well for 8 or 9 years but winter time it sucked....you can smoke on your BBQ ya know....  its my intention on building a large unit as soon as i find the material i require...but ill never go back to electric....food for thought ...
669986,dave524,2012-02-26 05:13:00,4508,"With my old Luhr Jensen L'IL Chief in the winter,  I slide the original box with the top and bottom cut off down over the unit, the insulation of the cardboard helps with the temperature."
670012,archer379,2012-02-26 10:51:00,277,i have a masterbiult 30 inch electric that i make jerky in mostly but have done a couple of chickens but i only got it for christmas so haven't used it that much. makes great jerky. 2 weeks ago sunday made 5 pounds of jerky gone by wednesday. works great
670040,Bluegill,2012-02-26 14:35:00,197, Looks good for me. How does it work in the winter?
670076,Billy Bob,2012-02-26 17:17:00,5865,"You could take a old electric heating element of some kind and make your own ""small"" smoker....you could even use a large cardboard box to do it....it's really up to your imagination if you only want a small smoker.  Small is limiting you too much......but I guess you need a small one for space restrictions or something....but if you can get a combo smoker/grill you are so much better off....here's just one of three of my grills on my deck and this one is also my smoker.

670087,Spouph,2012-02-26 18:25:00,115,big chief good but crappy winter and summer.  15 deg 8 hours Centrino good but need to open door too cool so burner comes on to produce smoke in summer. also hold moisure in so I drain the tray. 145 for 8 hours I run them both if I had to pick one it would be the centrino.  I have only ever smoked fish.  Done it for years.  
670159,Bluegill,2012-02-26 23:17:00,197,"Thanks a lot guys, very good helpfully infos!!"
670304,Hud,2012-02-27 13:04:00,140,make one....  I made mine for really cheap.  Works great.  PM me and I'll share
670338,Fang,2012-02-27 16:16:00,1330,"Half the fun in getting into smokers is checking out all the crazy contraptions other people come up with. I had a blast checking out the you tube videos and peoples web sites. You'll absorb a ton of information and stumble onto some good recipes.  I put mine together on the cheap side. A $20 electric hotplate from CTC, A 12x12 ceramic tile goes underneath it. Three $5 grills from CTC and about $40 in cedar from home depot. Probably cost me more in beer sitting in the garage having a cold one while drawing up plans and putting it together. If you do build one try and make it as air tight as possible with a smaller air exchange hole and be extra cautious with any material that can give off fumes when heating. OBS plywood is not recommended!!!  Mine works fine for what I do which is mainly trout. With the hot plate on medium I add a small extra cup to the chip tray with 2 lit charcoal bricks. Takes my smoker up to 170-190F mark. A $10 BBQ temp gauge sits on the door.    In action   Visit your local BBQ stores as their selection of chips and smoker accessories is growing. I have a BBQ Galore right behind me so easy to pick up my favourite Black Cherry wood chips"
670341,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 16:24:00,6899,"All I can say is WOW, that looks fantastic! Nice job Fang!"
670344,Fang,2012-02-27 16:29:00,1330,Forgot to add one thing. In this version the trays are too spread out. The bottom tray gets a fair bit more heat and smoke and about every hour I switch top and bottom racks. A better design for this system would be to move the racks closer together at the top. Gonna try and get it going this weekend if I can get out Saturday
