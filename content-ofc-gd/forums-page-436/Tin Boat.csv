670416,NAW,2012-02-27 20:09:00,4022,"Have you tried to tighten the rivets yet?  I only use sealant on rivets that have been pounded flat, and can not be tightened anymore.  At that point, it's either replace the rivet, or seal it.  If your only option is to seal, then I would try 3M 4200 or 5200 marine adhesive.  You can get it at Canadian tire in the marine section.  The stuff that I used takes a good 3 days to cure.  But once it's set up, it stays flexable, and doesn't leak a drop.  As for the foam..  That's preference.  I would like to have it for safety purposes.  But my boat doesn't currently have any foam in it at all."

I personaly have hardly looked into them other then i marked the ones that have been leaking. and well its an older boat that was handed down to me from my old fishing partner (my grandfather) so I just wanted to keep it up and running.  Thanks again guys!"

But have you put enough thought into not having this foam and then happen to become swamped? The foam is there originally to stop the boat from sinking any further then the gunnels. Without it she’ll be heading for the bottom; taking away whatever protection you still had from the storm that just swamped you. Storage is great in a small boat; but floating is way better, in my opinion?  Dan."
670842,fish-miester,2012-02-28 17:10:00,864,"   Very good point dan. i was actually thinking of buying some of the closed cell expansion foam, and adding it into the boat. where i could.  thanks again"
670851,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-28 17:21:00,10439, Make sure you don't buy the 1/2# foam as it will absorb water. Get 2# foam and it will last for ever.
