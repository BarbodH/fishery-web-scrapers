670711,BillM,2012-02-28 13:42:00,17367, I was about to mention this    Jacks fight like crazy though!!
670714,highdrifter,2012-02-28 13:52:00,2534," All jacks fight hard...  Actually, all ocean fishes fight hard.  Warm water=higher metabolism!!  Permits fight harder though.."
670725,johnnyb,2012-02-28 14:22:00,3413,So the secret to fishing is a smart phone....nice!
670844,lickmyarmpit,2012-02-28 17:12:00,359,"I wasn't sure never caught one of either before, what's the  difference the bony tail? They look almost identical."
670865,BillM,2012-02-28 17:36:00,17367, Jacks are more elongated then Permits are..  They are extremely easy to confuse though..  Also the jacks are a bit flatter on the bottom compared to the permit.  Permits also have a smaller mouth.
670894,highdrifter,2012-02-28 18:34:00,2534," A permit is a jack, essentialy.  But they're a distinct sub species..  The give-away is that small purty mouth.    cheers HD"
