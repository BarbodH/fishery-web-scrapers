Galvanic corrosion is the most common cause of    aluminum corrosion due to its inherent resistance to    more natural forms of corrosion and a lack of   preventative measures taken.

Galvanic corrosion is the most common cause of aluminum corrosion due to its inherent resistance to more natural forms of corrosion and a lack of  You are correct however the part of the formula missing is a median for the metals electrons to migrate is for the most part missing. You need a fluid to allow the electrolysis to occur. The boat in question likely lives on a trailer and since aluminum oxidizes rapidly it has the desired ability to seal itself. The use of Zinc and or Magnesium are used extensively to stop electrolysis in boats that are left in the water. I have a 28ft aluminum boat with stainless steel and brass shafts and screws that lives in brackish water and with the use of a galvanic isolator and zinc's it has survived since 1985 till today with no damage.

Galvanic corrosion is the most common cause of aluminum corrosion due to its inherent resistance to more natural forms of corrosion and a lack of  That’s why you should use marine grade adhesive with your ss hardware. Almost every aluminum boat I have seen with a transom mounted transducer has some sort of metal (mostly stainless) fasteners. There are over a dozen stainless screws and bolts in the transom of my boat including four 1/2"" mounting bolts for the outboard, I see no sign of corrosion what so ever. Not to mention everything else inside the boat, downriggers, electronics, trolling motor and various accessories are all mounted with ss fasteners. Corrosion is more of a concern in salt water OR if there is  a “voltage leak” to the metal hull. An aluminum hull is usually grounded through the motor but it is not used as a ground back to the battery. A boat hull should never be used to run ground to the battery, doing so is a recipe for corrosion regardless of salt or fresh water. Another important thing is to always make sure the sacrificial anodes on your engine are in good clean condition. Clean or replace as necessary."

670276,RSF,2012-02-27 08:21:00,47,"Why not play it safe. If you decide to use ss bolts and washers, you might consider insulating the contact points with rubber, rubber tubing or perhaps first marine--epoxy insulate around the holes, both sides and inside, then drill through the eg epoxy as not to make contact with the alluminum. Run  two ss bolts, washers and rubber washer so the rubber-only, is making contact with the hole area of hull. (Bolt side thread top: SS Washer--Rubber.   Nut side: Rubber--SS Washer--SS Lock Nut.) Then it's a tough, water tight and no mis-matched metals would be making contact."
