While the original plan was to stay at Kasha Lodge in one of the cottages, upon our arrival we were greeted by a most unwelcoming owner who portraid he was put out by our presece. Needless to say my buddy who had made all of the arrangements three weeks prior was miffed as to the downright rudeness and ignorant attitude of the owner. It was decided at this point that our money could be spent better elsewhere, by someone who actually gave a hoot. We ended up coming across a place called the Clansman Motel and Cottages. The owner Paul and his wife were most welcoming and a breath of fresh air considering what we had just been subject to at the other location. They are located directly on the shore of Lake Boshkung. Paul got us set up immediately in a roomy cottage, and got us out to the ice pronto. We even had the choice of propane or wood heat in the huts. Managed to get some fishing in till dark on the Tuesday, then did a full days fishing on the Wednesday, thus returning home the Thursday morning. Paul was out to check up on us as well as other guests every two to three hours and ensure that everything was okee dokie!! My two other pals, only managed a 1lb. laker that went back, but Wednesday afternoon I managed a nice 3 1/2lb. and 4 1/2lb. Laker within twenty minutes of each other.  All in all it turned into a great three day getaway considering the rough start. To those who have wives or girlfriends who are unsure about staying at cottage/hotel, I can attest that this location was absolutely spick and span!! I will defenately be back again to explore more of Boshkung. Also a special thanks to Chimpboy for the PM on Boshkung prior to our departure!! I have attached a pic of me with the catch od the day, hopefully it shows up!! Dan "
