Would really prefer a site that offers some excellent fishing as I would like to experience that true feeling of being ""in the middle of nowhere"". Don't know whether I should target brookies in Algonquin or some smallies/pike on the French. What would you guys do?, any help would be greatly appreciated!   Thanks a lot!  S&C"

That will give you the middle of nowhere feel, and likely put you into some good fish numbers. Anything other than an opening weekend weeked plus 2 or 3 though and you'll be smack into bug season and they are veracious in the park."
