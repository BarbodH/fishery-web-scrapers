Nor would the crowd  Wifey also had a good time, and she did not follow the family habit of going through the ice (it's a genetic thing   ) It sure was frosty out there, with near to no visibility at times. Judy was afraid we'd get lost. So she never moved more than 2 feet from the hut  to stretch her legs. I was nice and toasty, but Judy was a bit chilled, not enough layers  It was nice to see some favourite faces, and Judy now has her own fishing rod. Oh Yeah. It was a tough bite for many. We only managed 20 perch in 4 hours. Jose and the munchkin did worse, but they were having fun watching movies and eating pizza."

670299,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 12:33:00,6899," I've been watching for a report and pictures, so far all I have found is one article in a the Barrie Examiner Fishing for Tyler  I know there were at least two news papers there and saw quite a few people taking pictures, hopfully we'll get a report and some pictures posted today. I expect numbers will be down this year but it would still be nice to know how we did."
