It's named for her 15-year old son Tyler, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and raises funds to help offset the cost of therapy for the Innisfil family.  With thin ice offshore at Innisfil Beach Park for the Winterfest weekend, cancellation seemed likely.  ""The weather isn't co-operating. The ice isn't co-operating,"" Elisa said - but the support from the Ontario Fishing Community was still there, and the family was urged to hold the annual event. ""I thought we'd have to cancel it, but the people wanted it. They were willing just to come out and pull up lawn chairs, and talk about fishing! It's all for Tyler.""  Fishing for Tyler went ahead as planned on Saturday, but instead of fishing off Innisfil Beach Park, anglers signed in, then headed south to safe ice, in the Lefroy-Gilford area - coming back for the weigh-in and prizes.  Numbers were down, however.  ""Last year was the most we've had - 180,"" said Elisa. This year, about 70 anglers signed up, but ""whatever we make is fine. We don't have a goal. We appreciate the help.""?And with that help, she said, ""Tyler improves every year.  ""He's doing amazing. He's talking in sentences."" Now in High School, Tyler is showing great progress, especially in computers and math, Elisa said.  Tyler was on hand to congratulate the winner of the fishing derby - Erin Szabo, who brought in an 11 3/4"" perch, the largest fish of the day.  ""It is what it is,"" said a beaming Elisa French, joined by her family. ""We're happy, whether it's 25 or 100 people"" - it was all for Tyler.
