We watched them set up their portable and I was impressed that they even got it up with the wind blowing the way it was. I was talking to Beans giving him an update on how our day had gone when Sue let go with an ""OH NO"".  I guess the wind had caught their portable and within seconds it had come across the lake (about 1/2 a mile) and somewhere up on our shore line (we couldn't see it from the house). All I can say is I hope there wasn't too much damage to it.  I was going to get dressed and head out on my ATV to see if I could help them but by the time I got dressed they were already back off the ice and since I had no idea where to start looking for them at that point I didn't go out.  If you guys read this post, I hope everything worked out ok for you!"
