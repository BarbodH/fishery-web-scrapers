670009,Big Cliff,2012-02-26 10:31:00,6899,"There was a good crowd again this year but it was down from previous years, I do think the weather and lack of ice was a big factor but none the less, for those that went it was fun as usual! It was really nice to see many of the old faces and have a chance to catch up. I did miss some of the regulars that couldn't make it this year but hopefully next year."
