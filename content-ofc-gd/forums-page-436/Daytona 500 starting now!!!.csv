670626,danc,2012-02-28 03:01:00,4677,"Didn't mean to lol about this. Just not a Montoya fan. It turned out a little more serious than I first thought, but the good new is that everyone is OK."
670629,irishfield,2012-02-28 03:03:00,26272,"Job for Rod Caster there!!! 200 gallons of Kerosene and soil to remediate!! In Ontario.. the event would be over even without the fire.  Did anything break.. or did Juan just do his usual and screw up. Accelerate, caught apron grove and spun out.. UNDER CAUTION!"

670722,Mike Pike,2012-02-28 14:16:00,1332,"Discussing about watching things in real-time and not recording them in a thread yesterday, I decided not to DVR the race and just stay up and watch it.

670517,misfish,2012-02-28 00:15:00,29133,"HOLLY! SO SOON.    GO DALE,GO DALE"
670518,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-28 00:18:00,10439, It wasn't Danica's fault. And she almost made it through that without hitting anything.
670520,misfish,2012-02-28 00:22:00,29133,Yer home Dave?

670538,Muskieman,2012-02-28 00:51:00,2472,I expect a lot o wrecks ...
670545,misfish,2012-02-28 00:57:00,29133, Calming down now. Time for a snoozefest til 3 to go.
670572,danc,2012-02-28 01:39:00,4677, The 88 is blowing up next.
670576,BillM,2012-02-28 01:44:00,17367,"Guys, can someone tell me what hits the pavement that causes all the sparks when they get turned sideways? (On the banked corners)  I'm guess front/rear sway bars end links perhaps?  I don't know if I've ever seen them spark like that before!"
670583,danc,2012-02-28 01:57:00,4677,"Pretty sure that only happens when they are on the edge of the apron Bill. It's like climbing up a step there. Thus, pretty much anything can bottom out there when you're going sideways."
670587,BillM,2012-02-28 02:03:00,17367,"Yeah, I've only ever seen it if they crash in the corners..  I guess it could be as simple as body work hitting the ground as well, or even exhaust."
670589,misfish,2012-02-28 02:03:00,29133," yes he may or may not,but he,s ahead of you know who.  Sway bars,axel, it could be anything under the there."
670609,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-28 02:40:00,10439,JR's on the move.   :good:
670610,mikeseb,2012-02-28 02:40:00,201,GOOOOOOO DALLLLLEEE!!!!!
