669185,Drock6687,2012-02-23 18:31:00,90,I have done a fair amonut of fishing the last two season on the notty in wasaga for steelhead in the spring and fall.  I have only gone 2 times in the summer and didnt catch anything...are there fish in the notty in wasaga (by the provincial park) durring the summer months?
669227,chuckymcd,2012-02-23 20:09:00,144,"There is just hard to catch them lol , resident rainbows, browns, pike and the odd bass in there. im sure theres other stuff in there as well"
669262,Drock6687,2012-02-23 21:55:00,90,where I wish for steel head there is a sign saying no sturgen fishign... are there many of them swimmin around in there?
669267,davey buoy,2012-02-23 22:11:00,5505,I have heard yes.
669274,Rod Caster,2012-02-23 22:27:00,5784,I used to catch some tasty little yellow catfish a bit further up stream. 20FOW.
669277,NAW,2012-02-23 22:31:00,4022,I was thinking about fishing there this summer a little.  Know that I live just down the road.  I've heard there are a few good spots for pike in the area.
669345,BillM,2012-02-24 01:29:00,17367,"Not a summer fishery, unless you like catching smolts.  I've heard of catfish and stuff like that in the bottom end however."
669370,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 02:07:00,132,"used to go 2 a couple of spots upstream years ago, caught the odd pike or Bass, of coarse I was targeting trout...best chance I think is to drop in upstream and drift down and have someone pick you up, you can then access many good spots that you can't get to from shore...if you look at the satelite there is a little pond like area, east of blueberry trails I think it was called, between an auto wrecker and the snowmobile route, very hard to access back then, but you may even be able to do some ice fishing there if you can reach it"
669450,12footspringbok,2012-02-24 13:00:00,459,"Pretty much every species of fresh water fish you can find in Canada can be found in the Notty at certain times of the year.  I've seen or caught quite a few different species but, its pretty hit and miss. Sometimes if i feel like doing something different I'll fish it in June or July just for a change. You never know what you might pull out of there. Trust me..."
669491,craigdritchie,2012-02-24 14:26:00,1586,"There's a few smallish walleye down by the mouth, but not enough to be worth the drive if you live more than 15 minutes away."
669517,chuckymcd,2012-02-24 15:42:00,144, Sturgen are only in once every three or four years i believe.
669533,BillM,2012-02-24 16:43:00,17367,  Always sturgeon in there.   They all don't spawn the same year
669628,chuckymcd,2012-02-24 20:31:00,144," Good to Know, i live about 2 min from the river. might try it at some point"
669632,J-M,2012-02-24 20:46:00,65,"The notty is one of only a handful of rivers in Lake Huron which receives a run of lake sturgeon in the spring. There's a small population but they've been deemed threatened recently. This means that there is no legal fishing for sturgeon right now. This change just happened a few years back. Its too bad, would be quite the adventure to try to target sturgeon..the mnr is currently funding research/rehabilitation projects on the notty...."
669633,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-24 20:50:00,2690,    Did I miss something here
669644,davey buoy,2012-02-24 21:15:00,5505," Maybe he meant fishing for catfish,then who knows what you may get by accident:whistling:"
669646,bramptonjerry,2012-02-24 21:16:00,132,illegal closed in all of Ontario
669829,BillM,2012-02-25 15:47:00,17367, You can't target sturgeon in the river...  They are a protected species.
669873,SirCranksalot,2012-02-25 20:19:00,3291," I don't mean to nitpick, but there are areas in Ont where it's legal to catch sturgeon.   Also, I've been told there are lots of bass near the mouth in early July."
669887,wallacio,2012-02-25 21:06:00,475, Correct.   Here's some information on the status of Lake Sturgeon in Ontario:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/289879.pdf
670148,Drock6687,2012-02-26 22:41:00,90, Is the only way to get to the mouth to pay to get into the park?
670158,davey buoy,2012-02-26 23:16:00,5505,You have to still pay this time of year?
670176,SirCranksalot,2012-02-27 00:09:00,3291,"Getting in there is a bit tricky this time of year because the road isn't ploughed. There's nobody around to check on park passes, but come summer when the OP was interested in going, there will be someone on the gate most of the time."
670525,Drock6687,2012-02-28 00:28:00,90,In the summer do you have to enter thru the park or can you just walk down the beach till you end up at the mouth?
670931,SirCranksalot,2012-02-28 20:12:00,3291,I think the $ is more of a parking fee. Lots of people walk into the park in the summer w/o paying. When you pay you get a ticket to put on your dash.  I just wouldn't walk right next to the booth with my rod in hand. Just walk along the beach or the grass and you'll be OK.
