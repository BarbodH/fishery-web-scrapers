670090,bucktail,2012-02-26 18:46:00,1857,I am watching the Bassmaster Classic War room coverage and Dave is doing some interviews. He looks like he has lost a ton of weight. Good for him! Just hope its a good weight loss! Good for him!
670096,Gregoire,2012-02-26 19:14:00,1397,He has started working out. On his twitter account he tweets about his runs. An excellent lifestyle choice. I wonder if he was prompted by a health scare like diabetes. Either way it is not an easy thing to do.
670101,Fishnwire,2012-02-26 19:29:00,983,"Good one.  Seriously though...that's awesome for Dave. He used to be a bit more rotund than the average ""professional athlete""."
670103,Roy,2012-02-26 19:36:00,13728,Sorry guys. I modified a post. I think that Dave needs and deserves a little more respect than that.
670117,danbouck,2012-02-26 20:33:00,4380,As a big guy I know how hard it is to lose weight. With his schedule all I can say is  BTW Here is the link to the war room http://www.bassmaster.com/video/2012-bassmaster-classic-press-conferences  and for the weigh in http://www.bassmaster.com/video/2012-bassmaster-classic-weigh-ins
