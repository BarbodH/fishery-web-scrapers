670093,mercman,2012-02-26 18:52:00,7054,Awesome  
670113,adempsey,2012-02-26 20:02:00,1498,"Ugh, that sucks.  I rarely park on the ice and if I do it's usually < 1 FOW.  Maybe it's just me, but I found those two news anchors incredibly annoying.  I'd go nuts if I had to watch them on a regular basis."
670114,smally21,2012-02-26 20:06:00,993,"maybe its got something to do with the weather, you know, its above freezing almost all the time these days.  i hear ya on the news anchors. i couldn't even watch the whole clip."
670125,Fish Farmer,2012-02-26 20:59:00,2234,"I've been waiting to see how long it's going to be before it happens at Virginia Beach. It's beyond me why everyone parks so close together  , It's like they want to sink"
670147,hammercarp,2012-02-26 22:39:00,964,Them's that parks together sinks together.
670161,Spouph,2012-02-26 23:29:00,115,"  Hey mike I was on simcoe a few years back and I watched a whack of cars go through.  It was one big crack and then just slow motion, same thing 10 to 12 inches, people dont think, if they were driving a big rig they may worry but nobody adds up the weight of the combined vehicles.  I have a hard time parking on the ice because I am ususally one of the first on and last off, it is the dumb my mom hates me that park around me when gone that scares me.  The best part was I was with a group of three and I had my limit, and my buddies had just a few to go so headed back early to get the vehicle warmed up (we parked on land) but I took the other 2 guys fish with me.  At the time the cars went through A CO was just asking me about my day and licence.  What great timing, or I could have been in a tight spot with some explaining to do.  He said have a nice day and made a call.  Hey to all try to park a little out of the way from the weekend citidiots,to avoid this.  the tow truck was getting 800 cash.  he had a great day."
670188,Rizzo,2012-02-27 00:55:00,4754, good thing I carry 900 when I go fishing. I guess if you weren't carrying that much $ you could always drive to the bank machine...
670263,Joeytier,2012-02-27 03:31:00,3990,30 cars parked tight together on 12 inches of ice...what a gong show.
670317,oldphart,2012-02-27 13:59:00,665,"~~~I remember when Gord Booth ran Kingfishers out of Virgina Beach, he had Frank an old friend there directing people where to park, then a convoy of our southern cousins arrived and igorned Frank and parked tight together, and sure enough the ice gave, and it cost up to $400. just to be hooked up and tow out."
