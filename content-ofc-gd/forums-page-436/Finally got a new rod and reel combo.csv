669861,Dave Bailey,2012-02-25 19:23:00,1641,"After overworking my poor old Shimano combo for years I finally broke down and hauled out the credit card. Dropped in to Tightline around the corner and they had some show specials left over from last weekend, grabbed the Pflueger President package for $100, regular $130. Worth it? Don't know, but it can't make me a worse fisherman than I am now!"
669865,davey buoy,2012-02-25 19:34:00,5505,"From what I've been reading that is the ""go to"" reel. Good luck Dave!"
669867,Dave Bailey,2012-02-25 19:38:00,1641," I think I've used up all my luck, time to try working on skill, never used it before."
669869,mercman,2012-02-25 19:55:00,7054,"That combo is bullet proof Dave.Practice with a bell sinker.It has very high ratings on the sites i looked at. Now just practice your cast, and loosen up the joints in your release finger"

669882,SirCranksalot,2012-02-25 20:45:00,3291, Did it come with an 'anti-birnesting' guarantee?
669889,Dave Bailey,2012-02-25 21:13:00,1641, If it does I'm confident I can overcome it.
669929,SirCranksalot,2012-02-26 01:17:00,3291,"Maybe a reel company can design a market a ""Nestbuster"" model!"
