Nothing was done to the motor, you have to prime it 15 times, and it fires right up no problems first or second pull! sounds stupid but thats from the dealer. works great now, no regrets buying it anymore!"
669856,GYPSY400,2012-02-25 18:41:00,191," Where do you get this Information??  I've been a mechanic for 15 years, and I've never read something so ludicrous!!"
669862,Fisherman,2012-02-25 19:24:00,7201,"Remember ""just because 15 years"" doesn't always make something right or something else wrong.  I've heard that too, higher octane burns cooler and helps eliminate pre detonation.  As part of that event, carbon can be deposited in the combustion chamber and actually cause the volume of the cc to decrease, increasing the compression.  Exactly what Tybo said."
670187,spud7378,2012-02-27 00:53:00,68,with the new augars it says right in the manual not to run high octane could cause engine damage and will void the warrenty?
670269,Freshtrax,2012-02-27 03:59:00,2215,Also says no ethanol on a few right on  the fuel tank
670273,Sinker,2012-02-27 05:32:00,8692,I was going to ask how many times you pushed the primer......  S.
670302,spud7378,2012-02-27 12:37:00,68,"i was told to push it 15 times, by the dealer and since then it has started up perfect every time, no fighting with it."
670329,irishfield,2012-02-27 15:10:00,26272,15 times?
670330,BillM,2012-02-27 15:22:00,17367,Shouldn't have to push the primer 15 times.  Sounds like you've got an issue with the carb.
670336,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 16:09:00,6899," I agree you shouldn't have to push the primer 15 times, most of those units the primer actually suck the gas up from the tank, through the carb, through the primer bulb then back to the tank. Once the primer bulb is full and any air that was in the carb is out, you should be good to go, anything more than that isn't going to make any difference. Simon had his auger here last weekend, 4-5 pumps on the primer, turn on the choke, started first or second pull every time."
670362,Fisherman,2012-02-27 17:24:00,7201," Ah, don't know what model you have, all the Jiffy ones I've ever seen have an ""open"" primer that activates the diaphram, causes fuel to enter the carb and into the bottom of the crank case where it enters the combustion phase.  No fuel/oil is ever returned to the gas tank.  Matter of fact, I've never ever seen a retuern fuel line from any of those carbs back to the tank."
670366,ch312,2012-02-27 17:33:00,1590,"had her out again on friday. it's still not starting as quickly as i'd like (2-3 pulls) but it seems to be getting better. maybe it just needs to be run some more?  anyways, i had quite the little mishap after my bulky mitten got caught on the throttle while i was walking with the auger. ended up with a bruise on my shin and a 2"" slice in the top of one of my $180 baffin boots before i got it under control. the blade sliced through most of the pack in the boot and was about 1/8"" from gettin me toes   :wallbash:"
670410,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 19:50:00,6899," No, there isn't a return line from the carb to the tank. Fuel line goes to the carb from the tank. Then there is a line from the carb to the primer bulb inlet and a line from the primer bulb outlet back to the tank. When you push the primer bulb down it pushes gas/air that is in the primer bulb to the tank, when you release the primer bulb it sucks air/gas from the carb which creates a vacuum and draws gas from the tank into the carb.  This is taken right from the Jiffy operators manual: 1. Press primer bulb until gas (return) line is free of bubbles.  So if the only ones you have ever seen don't have a return line you might want to contact Jiffy, you are missing a part!"
670428,Headhunter,2012-02-27 20:20:00,5703,"Mines just over a year old and I find the same thing... just pump that primer ball until nothing but gas, give'er a pull and start cuttin... I don't think it have to pump it 15 times, but it's likely to be close to 10. HH"
670465,Fisherman,2012-02-27 21:55:00,7201," Well on my Model 30 Jiffy, there is no return line via the primer and yes the auger has been making noise(motor running) and drilling a hockey sack of holes for the last 20 years.  The primer is located on the left side of the engine cowl below the on/off switch.  There is one(1) black tube from the rear of the primer that runs to the bottom of the diaphram cover.  No gas ever enters this tube.  When you press and release this primer, it pushes up on the needle valve to allow a squirt of gas into the carb.  I'm quite sure Feldman Engineering didn't build just one special Jiffy model 30 for me alone."
670469,fishermccann,2012-02-27 22:02:00,655,"After that, I would like to sugest, on behalf of your toes , that you put that machine down, and never talk of it again."
670481,Big Cliff,2012-02-27 22:33:00,6899," You know what, good for you! All I have ever done is try to help people on this board but you always seem to know better than anyone else so from now on, I'll just keep my mouth shut and let you help everyone!  Have fun!"

666027,ecmilley,2012-02-13 12:49:00,2163,"what i have done in the past is pull it over 2-3 times with the choke on and ignition off, then flip the switch and pull usually fires right up. sounds like you may have a stuck needle and seat though not enough fuel flow to get it going"
666240,spud7378,2012-02-14 01:22:00,68,should i take this thing back to jiffy before the warrenty runs out? it only a few months old
666287,GYPSY400,2012-02-14 04:02:00,191," Sorry for having to correct you, but I just had to in the nicest way I could think of.. I know your a knowledgable guy and other members seem to value your opinion so i'd hate to see someone get some bad information from you.   I've been a mechanic for 15 years, I have the odd brain fart too!"
666288,GYPSY400,2012-02-14 04:04:00,191,"  I would, that's what the warranty is for.. If you try fiddling with it, they may deny your warranty on future issues."
666295,wormdunker,2012-02-14 08:14:00,1711,"I also have a jiffy (2hp) which is 5 years old with starting/running problems.  What my mechanic discovered was - gas was leaking out of the vent screw on the gas tank as I was drilling holes.  As the gas dripped down it was being sucked into the carburetor, soaking the foam air filter which in turned was causing it to run as though it had full choke.  He put in a new O ring where the carb is mounted to the machine, a new fuel line (old line was soft).  He suggested I only pour in 1/2 a tank of gas to avoid spillage.  He also turned up the idle just a bit.  My new starting procedure is to put on full choke, 1 or 2 pulls (till it coughs),set choke to 1/2 choke, pull cord 1 maybe 2 times.  My auger starts right away.  Let it warm up at 1/2 choke, as it warms up be ready to turn the choke off.  I also close the vent screw on the gas tank to avoid gas dripping down to the carb/air intake.  I must open the vent screw after I auger 2 holes while it is idling.  Then close the screw, auger a couple of holes, then open the screw once again.  I know the operator's manual says to turn the choke off after the inital cough with the choke on full.  Their procedure does not work on my machine.  Hope this info helps U get more fishing in rather than fight with an auger."
666308,Big Cliff,2012-02-14 11:39:00,6899," No, I'm glad you did correct me and you did it very professionally!   I'd hate to give anyone bad information too, in the future I'll read what I've typed before I hit that send button LOL. Hope to meet up with you one day and buy you a cold one (or hot one as the case may be)."
666793,ch312,2012-02-15 20:47:00,1590,"it seems much easier to start after i poured half the gas out of the tank? but, this is also at room temperature so i'll have to put it out in the cold for a while to see if it still starts good under normal conditions.  hopefully she gets better with age"
666823,Freshtrax,2012-02-15 22:13:00,2215,Premium has zero ethanol in it.  You don't need it for the octane rating just the no ethanol factor 2strokes and ethanol don't play nice
666858,skeeter,2012-02-16 00:27:00,1907,"Gypsy400, I apologize for jumping on you so fast. Big Ciff was wrong  and you corrected him."
666863,Tybo,2012-02-16 00:38:00,1373,So whats the reasoning behind having no ethanol and running a higher octane?
666866,Fisherman,2012-02-16 00:41:00,7201,Oh boy...   Can't wait.
666867,Freshtrax,2012-02-16 00:42:00,2215,"The fuel with ethanol I find dosent have the same ""shelf life"". 30days or so is all I trust it .. So in a chainsaw that gets used once or twice a year can gum up carbs.  Or in a boat that dosent get used everyweekend.   I have found with experiance running ethanol free fuel in all my 2strokes cuts down on carb matinence considerably.  The higer octane rating is in most cases not needed but premium fuel is the only ethanol free fuel I can find"
666871,Tybo,2012-02-16 00:53:00,1373,"So a gasoline that is filled with detergents that break down the lubricant properties of gas is going to last longer, then a gas with a natural ingredient."
666927,Freshtrax,2012-02-16 02:21:00,2215,Hey man sounds like you've already have an opinion on this subject. You asked. I don't know why but I do know you put ethanol fuel in your boat I'll but no corn in mine... Let them sit for a month or so. Mine will run better.  I think the lubricating properties of the fuel are outweighed by the oil you mix it with.
666943,Freshtrax,2012-02-16 02:35:00,2215,Well I figuerd I should find out why. A little digging this is what I found.. I know kinda off topic.. http://www.fuel-testers.com/expiration_of_ethanol_gas.html Ethanol is hydroscopic
666970,Tybo,2012-02-16 03:42:00,1373,Just crunch some numbers using the text you added. Ethanol based E-10 by it's self can only absorb 0.0130 of a gallon of water.That's at 7000 parts per 1.000.000 This is a far cry from 0.5% you need for separation.
666982,Sinker,2012-02-16 03:57:00,8692,"Well I'll run my ethanol free fuel thru everything I have, and you run your corn gas thru your stuff, and we'll all be happy.  I'd rather not have to worry about it, thanks.  Most premium fuel still has ethanol folks. The only fuel I can find with NO ethanol is Shell V-power. I run it in everything.  S."
667000,wormdunker,2012-02-16 11:00:00,1711,X2  Only Shell for my outdoor toyz
667001,Tybo,2012-02-16 11:14:00,1373,It's the condensation build up in the fuel tank. Since most fuel tanks are built of metal you are going to get condensation. With E-10 absorbing water you will get a little more condensation in the tank. All fuels that have been stored for more then 3 months should be changed.  Now running a higher octane fuel in a engine that's not designed for it is bad.The higher the octane the more compression.Which is really hard on the rings.which can cause premature wearing or crack the rings. Engines designed for high octane have stronger rings and valves.
667016,Garnet,2012-02-16 12:46:00,2056,Quit fussing with it. Bay Sports is in North Bay distributor of Jiffy.
667158,Freshtrax,2012-02-16 19:27:00,2215,"Tybo. That's wrong.  Higer octane fuel is made for higher compression engine's, it does not and can not affect the compression of an engine that would require an alteration in the dimensions of the the bore, stroke or cylinderhead. An octane rating is  a numerical figure that relates to how much squish can applied to the fuel before it detonates due to compression.  If this happens (running regular in a hi-comp. Motor). The fuel detonates while the piston is still moving upwards... The damage is like a head on collision and results in cracked pistons, bent conecting rods and cylinder head damage.   Not trying to be a dick tybo but the statement you made is wrong.  No damage can occur from running a higer octane rating than nessacary except to wallet."
667161,Freshtrax,2012-02-16 19:28:00,2215,Ps. Original poster.  Take it to a dealer if its under warenty.  That's what its for
667253,Tybo,2012-02-16 23:22:00,1373,Higher octane level makes the combustion chamber run cooler.The cooler the chamber the denser the air and or fuel if carburated. increasing combustion at TDC. In turn creates a higher combustion ratio.This only happens in engine that are made to run 87 octane not high compression engines. in a car engine it will automatically idiot you timing for this problem.Engines with out self timing it could be detrimental.
667256,Sinker,2012-02-16 23:33:00,8692,"Ok, I have an 18 year old outboard that has only seen premium fuel. NEVER an issue.  We have a jiffy auger that is over 20 yrs old, nothing but premium. Never an issue.  Have multiple chainsaws, nothing but premium, NEVER an issue.  Weed whacker, generators, ATV's, Snowmobiles.....you get the point.  I've never in my life had a fuel related issue.

665356,mike rousseau,2012-02-10 18:08:00,4661,Maybe the gas sat too long...  Half tank over 1.5 winters...  Did you put any stabilizer in it?

665360,troutologist,2012-02-10 18:21:00,951,"Even with stabilizer in my Jiffy I find I need to put new gas in it at the start of each year to get it to run right.  New gas, a little Sea Foam and it should run a lot better."
665383,Lip-ripper,2012-02-10 19:21:00,228,"I've seen this alot with newer Jiffy's... they aren't like the old ones. Drain it and try premium fuel, that may help."
665384,Nipfisher,2012-02-10 19:30:00,2449,"I had problems (with an older one) a few years ago and took it in for a service. It started and ran fine for the guy in the shop. He said it was likely the significant temp. change from my warm garage to the fishing spot. He says condensation gets into the gas with all the temp changes. I would try new gas and stabilizer, also letting the auger adjust to the cold temps before using it."
665403,Big Cliff,2012-02-10 20:53:00,6899,"Yup, even stabilizer is only good for about 6 months (even though they claim UP TO TWO YEARS)the key word being up to  Drain your fuel out of it, put fresh fuel in it, it might still be a little hard to start the first time but should be ok after that."
665474,Bluegill,2012-02-11 01:19:00,197, I also use the gas from last season never a problem with that. But maybe it can help to read about how I handle my Jiffy starting problems.

665656,Big Cliff,2012-02-11 22:46:00,6899,"Just be careful when adjusting the carbs on any two stroke, too lean and the engine will run better than it ever has but not for long, the engine gets it's lubrication from the unspent fuel getting past the rings and into the crank case. If you lean it out too much then you don't get enough lubrication and you can take the piston, rings and cylinder out of an engine very quickly.  To do it properly it should be done with a tachometer to Manufacturers specifications. If you are going to do it by ear (not the best way) once you get the high speed adjusted, open it up a little more (counter clockwise)just until you hear it start to hesitate a little. You will hear the RPMs start to drop as you open the high speed jet, keep going (won't take much) and you'll hear it change from the wine. That is where you want it if you want that engine to last. I have done it this way in the past and know lots of mechanics that do but I really prefer to use the tachometer to get the best performance out of an engine."
665718,spud7378,2012-02-12 02:37:00,68,"my jiffy is only new since xmas, ive had problems with it as well, i found it to be the gas cap, the new ones dont have the needle valve."
665755,FishAbout,2012-02-12 04:03:00,106,I run mine out of gas everyfall. Doing this the carb will not gum up.  Put stabilizer in the gas also. No problems yet with mine.  Use only high test gas and a good high quality 2 stroke oil also.
665782,Big Cliff,2012-02-12 11:39:00,6899," No, the carb won't gum up but the diaphram can dry out and it will shorten the life of it. Old school was run em dry. Now it is recommended to use a good quality stabilizer and store them with the tank full."

665889,Fisherman,2012-02-12 21:58:00,7201,Stiff diaphram won't allow the little metal tip on the diaphram to activate the needle valve and allow enough gas to flow.

It seems like that both myself and ch312 are having the same problem  Also to the guys that are stating use premium fuel, the book says dont, so who is right is it better or will it damage the unit?  thanks"
665932,FishAbout,2012-02-13 00:18:00,106,"I will still run them out of fuel. I drain the carbs on the sled also and 2 stroke outboard motors.  Have never had a problem and been doing this for years.  The material used in diaphrams now is better then what it used it be. When you buy a auger it has no gas in it and it could of sat on the shelf for 2 years or in a warehouse and they are still fine. Its up to the person but with the gas now days why would you want a few litres of gas sitting in the tank.  They say that gas now days only holds it octane rating for 3 weeks now, this is coming from the mercury course I just took.  Stablizer helps it to stay longer. The sta-bil brand stabilizer is not the best there is out there. Its made up of alcohol which does not help with ethonal separtion. Mercury stabilizer is not made up from achohol."
665985,Fisherman,2012-02-13 03:00:00,7201,"Check around and see where your local Jiffy repair shop is.  A lot of small engine shops can do it.  If you wish to do it yourself, you'll find a number or letter/number identifier on the side of carb mount. (Mine has an ""F"") Take that to the shop along with the engine serial/model number, they will give you the diaphram.  Ask specifically which way the diaphram goes. One side has a larger diameter disk than the other, it's important. I have a 1991 Jiffy 3HP, I've changed the diaphram 3 times, in 20 years, they get brittle.   Secondly, I just use regular gas with Amsoil synthetic, I mix at 50:1.  I only mix a litre at a time, I have never ever used more than 2 litres in a whole winter.  No point in letting gas get stale, I find it's easier to make small fresh batches.  Good luck."
665989,GYPSY400,2012-02-13 03:13:00,191," This statement is unfortunately totally untrue.. What you are describing is "" blow-by"" which happens on worn out four stroke engines.. If this was the case on a 2-stroke, it would not run.  2 stroke engines get their lubrication from the gas/oil mix entering the crank-case (crankshaft) first, then travelling up to the cylinder via the piston ports to be burned.. A good way to view this is to look at a 2-stroke outboard and note where the Carburator, crankshaft (flywheel) and spark plugs are located.    Sooo, in regards to running a 2-stroke dry for the season... Yes, some guys do, and some guys don't .. It's good in regards to getting the carburator dry, ( which doesn't totally get dry) but it also runs the crank bearings dry.. So IMO , park it for the season with a full tank of premium fuel, with added stabilizer .. Remember to run the engine for about 10 minutes to get the stabilizer throughout the whole fuel system before storing it.."
