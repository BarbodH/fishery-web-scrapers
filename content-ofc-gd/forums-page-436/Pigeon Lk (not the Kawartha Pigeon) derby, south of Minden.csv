Me and my Dad were 1st to the spot and spread out tip-ups and gear etc to mark out territory. The guys from last year showed up and crowded in on us from the one side. The guy was complaining his buddies didn't get up early enough so they could get the spot. They had about 16 people fishing.  I marked only 4 fish all day, 3 didn't even stop to look at the minnow, the 1st one, around 9am tapped the minnow twice, moved off and hit the tip-up 50 feet down the shore. I felt it, set the hook, but the fish must have had the minnow by the tail, no hook -up, that was it for the day for us  the guys beside us again won with a 2.8lbs and a 2.3lbs laker, 1st and second place  136 guys, 12 fish entered  we got gift certificate prizes of $40 and $60, so that's not bad but a pretty disappointing day"

670310,johnnyb,2012-02-27 13:39:00,3413,"Ouch...at least you didn't come away empty handed.  Is it set up so that people have to fish in a pre-determined area, or do they have free roam?  Electronics allowed?"
670348,jimmer,2012-02-27 16:46:00,2730,"They need to stock that lake again! I think it's a free for all johnnyb, but hopefully I'll be corrected if I'm wrong. I think they want it more of a fun day than have it too competetive."
670355,johnnyb,2012-02-27 17:02:00,3413,One of these days we'll get a winter weekend in Minden...kills me that the cottage gets boarded up and untouched until Spring  
670669,chris.brock,2012-02-28 06:48:00,4053,"it's a smaller, stocked lake, they put in about 500 fish every 2nd year, it's easy access for people to walk out and fish you can fish where ever you like, ATV's and sleds are allowed, 2 lines per guy if you do catch even a tiny laker, you know you will be in the prizes it supports the Minden Volunteer Fire Dept., always a fun day, I just get competitive  johnnyb- it's great up there in the winter, way quieter than the summer season"
