669811,Rod Caster,2012-02-25 14:09:00,5784,"A nice price for a 2 or 3 man, but not much info on the site, or anywhere else online. 179 for the 3-man vs. 140 reg price.  http://ca.wholesales.../prod10965.html  Has anybody used a Crystal or Woods ice tent? Are they under 30lbs? Some of the other smaller shelters weight over 50lbs...that sounds horrible for a backlake trip especially after you add the weight from the other gear. Edit to say: 50lbs must include a sleigh.  Here is a comparable 3-man Rapala Ice Tent. Higher price. 250 https://www.thefishi...07&ALL=ALL&d=07   The Eskimo 6-man quickfish looks like a good deal as well... 38lbs isn't bad for this much space. http://www.cabelas.c...n=1188&ID=14999  Any thoughts? Comparative products? Could I just buy a cheap portable tent and basically get the same advantage a shelter offers?"

669871,Rod Caster,2012-02-25 20:07:00,5784,Lebarons has the Rapala tents on-Sale. 185 for the 3-man is a good price vs. 250 at the fishinhole  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_spec/rapala_rapshack_web.pdf
669878,Ice_ice,2012-02-25 20:35:00,18,Lol seriously? Talking about huts... I'd be checking for tents this time of year.
669879,bdox,2012-02-25 20:35:00,329,Here's the manufacturer's website. I couldn't find any weight specifications though...
669933,Rod Caster,2012-02-26 01:25:00,5784, I already own a tent... But my gf won't let me cut holes in the floor.
