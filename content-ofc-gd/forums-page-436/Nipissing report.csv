Not knowing which area to target I just stopped the Atv near 2 other huts.  I augered 3 holes, got set up & almost instantly the bite was on.  I didn't move all afternoon, at times I could only manage 1 rod, cause the other rod was basically feeding the fish!  I fished from 1:00 - 5:30.  I was fortunate enough to land a limit of wallys, 30 perch, of which 4 were 12"".  The other perch were 8-10"".  Also landed a Cisco (lake herring) approximately  2 1/2 lbs.  I was advised by a fellow fisher that Ciscoes on Nipissing are full of worms so I released it.  I recently purchased the new Humminbird Ice 55.  Amazing how the flasher showed the Cisco coming up from the bottom to chase down my bait.  Twice during the day I caught 2 walleye that were shown to be suspended at 24 fow.  I was in 40 fow.  I raised my bait to 24 fow WHAM, fish on!  I have never used electronics during the hard water season until recently.  Without the flasher I would not have seen those fish up in the water column.  Really exciting."

670284,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-27 11:34:00,2690,Sounds like a great time. Electronics are worth their weight in gold on the ice.
670290,Rod Caster,2012-02-27 11:57:00,5784,"Right on Brian. Sounds like a carbon copy of my last few outings on Nip...  I guess you have a ""go-to"" spot now?"
670300,spud7378,2012-02-27 12:34:00,68,"awesome brian, you will have to come back more offten!"
670670,wormdunker,2012-02-28 07:27:00,1711,"Heading to the hot spot Sat AM.  No need to go too early, too damn cold.  My luck the fish will have moved!!  I noticed alot of the locals don't even go out till later in the day.  The evening bite is good!!"
670699,limeyangler,2012-02-28 13:18:00,5204,Sounds like fun to me!  Great report....electronics ROCK!
670743,Joeytier,2012-02-28 14:57:00,3990,Good goin.  I've yet to eat a herring out of Nip that I didn't like...
670797,johnnyb,2012-02-28 16:29:00,3413,Having the sonar  out there changes everything!  Wait until your battery dies and you have to fish without it  I got my first herring out of Nip this year....was all excited to eat it...only thing healthy about it were the worms squirming around inside it
