He is a pretty quick learner and has put some quality fish on the ice, already.  Today was a very slow day out there, we didnt mark a whole lot of fish, but the ones we did were big ones.  I had Kyle ripping a lipless crankbait up high and this fish hit around 930am.  I've added some other photos since my last report.  Most fish taken on X-Zone Swammers in pearl and Cisco.

669477,johnnyb,2012-02-24 14:07:00,3413,"Dang!  Beautiful stuff there    I was trying out your technique of cranking up 30 feet after jigging on bottom for a bit.  Couldn't believe it when I was ready to give up and drop back down again, two fish streaked off bottom to have a look.  They didn't hit, mind you, but, certainly opened my eyes a little to how these Simcoe lakers work.  When they charge up....do you move the bait at all?"
669479,BillM,2012-02-24 14:09:00,17367,"Johnny, if you see those fish streaking off the bottom, keep reeling!   I've had lakers smash 20ft below the hole in 100ft of water."
669481,Rod Caster,2012-02-24 14:10:00,5784,"Minimum 10"" hole I'm guessing. Wow, what a tank."
669483,Leecher,2012-02-24 14:13:00,7832,Beauty    Congrats to Kyle
669492,steverowbotham,2012-02-24 14:26:00,1800,"Take it away from them, the whities though, deadsticking is often best.  I could listen to Kyle's laugh in the video all day hahaha"

669752,MJL,2012-02-25 02:55:00,2427,"Incredible fish  Definitely a fish of a lifetime. Great pics and vid   Yup! Eyes on the sonar, take a deep breath, crank the reel and wait for that spongy feeling at the end of the line  With that said, it's like a slap in the face when you see them chasing your lure from 120ft to 20ft only to reject it in the end."
