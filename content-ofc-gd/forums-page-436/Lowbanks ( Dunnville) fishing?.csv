669928,RSF,2012-02-26 01:15:00,47,"I'm about to fish the area this year. Not opened my new Lake Erie maps yet, but I'm pretty-sure the Mohawk area is included. Things can get rough out there fast, so my primary concern was where all the breakwall mooring areas are located.  Jjust bought a SeaMax Inflatable Oceon 380 (my first inflatable) so first time-out and knowing it's limits is nothing I would chance without knowing where the closest breakwalls are. My last boat was a forteen foot w/40 Merc, never a problem with lake water conditions, except once in Lake Ontario about a mile and half out -- weather change. Good thing I read a book on how to manage 6' waves in a possible swamping condition to get back to slack water."
