Then got the venison prepped with olive oil, soya sauce, worcestershire (spell check here lol) salt & pepper    Dropped the veggies and venison in the pan      Second course Ummm!    Ate like a king    Even had left over for breakfast tomorrow    Tomorrow my daughter is competing for YBC National... if they finish first... their going out east to Newfoundland  Tight lines Leechman"
