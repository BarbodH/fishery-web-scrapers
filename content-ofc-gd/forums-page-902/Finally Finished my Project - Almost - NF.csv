The easiest part of it being cutting the design in the wood, which was done last fall but the next step was the longest.... painting.... 15 sets of them.   Got the first coat of white on, the day before yesterday and applied the color coat yesterday.  Still have to add the eye guides and the reels and a coat of varnish to protect the paint job.  Really small details and really proud of the outcome.   Thought I'd share this with you guys....  took a couple of pics, here they are      Leechman"
