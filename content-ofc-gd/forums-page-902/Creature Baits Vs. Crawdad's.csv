302262,rbaquial,2009-02-06 06:27:00,968,"Hey Guys/Gals,  Just wanted to ask a few questions regarding  CREATURE BAITS  VS.  CRAWS?  * What's your opinion on them? * Do you find one produces more over the other? * Which one do you prefer? * What type of fishing line is best to use with the CREATURE BAIT? (IE: Flouro, Mono, Braid) * What lb.# test is good to use? * Can you rig these with BASS JIGS? ( FOUND HERE ) Or... are they better left ""as is"" on a WIDE GAP HOOK? FINALLY... * What is recommended to rig these CREATURE BAITS?  PS: I would assume best places to throw this bait would be around rocks & cover? (basically anywhere, where you'd find a small insect hiding?) Can anyone elaborate on this if I am wrong?  Thanks Guys! Rob"

I put all those plastics - hula grubs, craws, creatures, beavers, otters - in the same category. Fish them either on a bass jig, or T-rigged on a wide gap hook. I would use them to target fish holding to cover or structure."
302280,OhioFisherman,2009-02-06 12:07:00,6623,"plastic crawfish are usually seen rigged as a trailer on a bass jig, I have also fished them on a plain jig head in rocky area for smallies when I am looking for a smaller profile bait.  Creature baits are more or less a flipping and pitching lure, rigged Texas style. Them and the craw have their uses, but most of the time it`s a worm or lizard for me, usually if you throw a worm or lizard in front of a bass it will take it, same with a tube.  No particular line test for me, although I do try to fish heavier line in junk, usually 17-20 pound Stren mono. Unusual for me to use less than 10# test anyway expect in open water.Hardly ever used braid or floro. 3/0 - 5/0 widegap hook, mustad ewg works for me. Texas style and usually pegged with a rubber peg.  Although cover can be a feeding spot I believe it is more often used as an ambush point, safety zone.  Opinion? Doesn`t hurt to carry some if a different look is needed to provoke a strike, not something to get carried away on.  alot of different ways to rig most soft plastics and at times it doesn`t hurt to experiment."
