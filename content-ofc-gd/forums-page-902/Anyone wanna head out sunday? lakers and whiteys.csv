301009,silvio,2009-02-03 18:28:00,433,Donâ€™t want to scramble at the last minute to hook up with someone so I am posting in advance. I got Sunday off work and want to head to simcoe for some whitey and laker action just wondering if anyone wants to hook up.  It would be much appreciated to have someone come out with me for company and maybe even a few fish. Let me know.

301114,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-04 00:54:00,260,"I am up for heading to Simcoe.  Plans for renting a hut or do you have a portable set up?  I have done the hut thing before but only for perch.  This operator comes recommended, reasonable rates:  http://www.fishinontario.com/icefishing/la...nhalesfishhuts/"
301127,Cudz,2009-02-04 01:22:00,2652,Bring your rubber boots boys.  Looks like it might be a slucshy wet one.
301132,jdmls,2009-02-04 01:28:00,575," LOL, its funny cause its true.... It only takes a couple outings of walking in a foot of snow and getting skunked to turn you off of the hard water . I might get out a couple more times before the steel rolls in."
301137,silvio,2009-02-04 01:35:00,433,"Me and Dave are a bad combo when it comes to whitey's lol, 5 min out there and we give up and start the walk to 20 fow lol."

301139,Streamerguy,2009-02-04 01:39:00,121,"Just got back with this outfitter recommended by Sinker and I was very pleased with the service this guy showed us,more minnows than we needed,he drilled us 5 more holes outside the hut,excellent time out.We ended up coming home with over 80 perch and tossed back just as many...check him out, he will put you on fish!!  http://www.timhalesfishhuts.com/rates.html   gl to ya  Streamerguy"
301144,rhare,2009-02-04 01:44:00,387,"I should be out on the weekend, not sure what the plan is but Im sure you could tag along"
301309,12footspringbok,2009-02-04 15:11:00,459,I'll most likely be heading out depends on the weather mostly if its going to be nice then i can take the little sleigh and i don't mind a far walk but if its going to be really cold i don't like fishing in the open.
301700,DMASSE,2009-02-05 11:58:00,420,"Silvio  give me a call,  was thinking of renting a hut for  the deep water,   or getting a taxi with the portable.."
301709,River Rat,2009-02-05 12:23:00,161,Looks like I'm heading out.....should be a big mess of slush so I'll be guy in waders.  RR
