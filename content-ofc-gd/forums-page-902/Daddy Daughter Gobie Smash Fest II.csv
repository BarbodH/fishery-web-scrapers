301546,Hubbard,2009-02-05 01:58:00,22,"Great report, that second vid made me laugh.  I have an 11 month old son now and I cant wait to do that with him. Thanks for sharing"
300765,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-03 01:53:00,2050,"I spent most of my weekend working in the office, and watching the beautiful weather from my window, so I decided tonight I was going to take Averie out before dark for some more of that non-stop gobie action.... it was our first time hitting the ice without ""mommy supervision""     we ended up going to the store for chocolate on the way home...  Believe it or not we didn't get into any fish until our third hole - like 2 feet away from the 2nd hole...even gobies won't move far for food through the ice.  Here's some pix of our short trip...     One of many fish...   Headin' home...   Gotta love livin' in the country....   and here's a pro in action... pretty good for a 2 year old!   And another...lol   Anyways, I'm dying for the softwater season to kick off...enough panfish and gobies for me.... but as always, as long as the kid is catching fish she's happy, and so am I!  Cheers, UF - & daughter"
300792,super dave,2009-02-03 02:33:00,323,That's fantastic.  I have a 10 1/2 month old daughter and I can't wait to take her fishing.  Thanks for sharing.
300798,tbayboy,2009-02-03 02:38:00,1497,"Brilliant, those sun glasses are a riot.  The second video was priceless: ""I get him!"".  Thanks for sharing, great smile material for a monday."
300800,smokin joe,2009-02-03 02:54:00,226,"Great post!!  There's nothing better than getting the little ones out.  And I really like the second video, thanks for sharing"
300832,douG,2009-02-03 04:04:00,2693,What a champ you have there!  She is one lucky chile for sure.  Great videos.
300842,steverowbotham,2009-02-03 04:21:00,1800,that videos hilarious. so adorable
300843,irishfield,2009-02-03 04:22:00,26272,So what does she do when you stomp on their heads...
300848,snag,2009-02-03 04:28:00,1932,"That's pretty cute Ryan.  However,  Gobies are a ""gateway"" fish.   Actually, I did teach my neice and nephew how to catch them.  Let's just say there are some fat seagulls out there!  Congrats!!"
300851,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-03 04:37:00,2050,"Thanks guys - hard to beat time out with your kid!  Irish...she takes them home in a white bucket of all things and I '""take care"" of them after she goes to bed..."
300852,irishfield,2009-02-03 04:38:00,26272,LOL Ryan... you can't hide reality for ever bud!
300855,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-03 04:43:00,2050,she's only TWO man!  lol most kids her age that I know are still wearing diapers and barely talkin' - I think we can let the gobie stomping slip for a little longer...
300859,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-03 04:48:00,2050,"the other day I told my wife I was going to buy an ice hut and she said she'd kill me if I came home with one, and Averei started crying and said '""don't kill my daddy'"" man it was hard to keep a strait face while calming her down....so yeah...i'm laying off the slaying of gobies for a little bit... I think she watches to many action movies with me as it is.. haha"
300869,snag,2009-02-03 05:23:00,1932,  (he throws them from his plane onto p3ta rallies!)
300873,rbaquial,2009-02-03 05:38:00,968," LOL!!! Sounds like she's ""Daddy's Girl"" eh?! Your kid is freakin' adorable!!  I remember when my 6yr old cousin came fishing with me and some buddies... his 2nd time out...he knows the story of ""Gobies"".. and what we're supposed to do to them. Anyway, he caught a GOBY... not realizing it was a GOBY (probably cause he's only seen a GOBY 5x times the 1st time around fishing)....anyway, as I was taking the GOBY off the hook - he goes and talks to his brother telling him how ""I GOT 'EM!!""...as soon as I removed the hook from the GOBY... my 6yr old cousin turns around....literally, last thing he saw... was my foot bringing ""DA THUNDA"" on the fish! OH MAN.... the reaction I saw on his face?! ....""YOU KILLED HIM!!""....immediatly bursts into tears...... then his brother goes...""Dude!...That was a GOBY"".... he immediately goes into ""BIG MAN MODE"" .... wipes his tears... and goes ""I KNEW THAT! I KNEW THAT!!!""....  OH MAN!! IT WAS CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSIC!! (I'm laughing now just thinking about it!!)  PS: Thanks for sharing your story!! (reminds us of what GOOD MEMORIES really are)"

300920,ccmtcanada,2009-02-03 13:37:00,7971,"How cute is that???  Jeez...she looks like a natural with that rod and reel!!  We took our little one goby fishing last summer.  Put them all in a bucket...told her right away that they wouldn't be going back in the water...and that we were going to throw them in the bushes.  Things went great right up until it was time for disposal.  She picked her favourite one, named it, and wanted pictures of it so she cuold remember it.  She then cried all the way home....until she got some ice cream anyways...LOL."
