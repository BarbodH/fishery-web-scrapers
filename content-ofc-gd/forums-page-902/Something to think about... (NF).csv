301520,Gerritt,2009-02-05 01:27:00,6129,"  Given my line of work Glen, I will not be out of work for long... infact I quit my job a little over a month ago.. and had the luxury of taking a week off (my choosing)... as I have alot of contacts in the industry.. needless to say I was hired the same day I started to make a few calls... Union wage, without the union is nice....  I am not a proud person when it comes to earning my living.. if they want to pay 45.00 an hour to build a custom home or shovel crap.... there is no difference to me.. an hour is an hour... perhaps more people need to view their job as I do..

If you are handy you can advertize for odd jobs on Kijiji (I'm surprising the wife with a 5th anniversary trip back to the same resort we went to on our honeymoon by doing odd jobs this way. It let me pay for the trip without her knowing about it!). I also sell flies that I tie and other baits I make at home.

301720,OhioFisherman,2009-02-05 12:42:00,6623,"Phil, ya buddy! Your company loses billions, you come whining to the tax payers for help and deserve millions in pay and perks for it?  A bonus for being extra STUPID? The worlds biggest self promoters."
301734,Gerritt,2009-02-05 13:24:00,6129,"This will upset you..... CitiBank is a recipient of federal bailout funds.... that the taxpayers LOANED them.... why is it them that CitiBank can afford $400 million dollars for the naming rights for the New York Mets new stadium?   I think the new stadium should be called ""Screw the taxpayer field""  G"
301751,OhioFisherman,2009-02-05 14:02:00,6623,Just one set of millionaires helping another set of millionaires get richer! At the peoples expense.  They should be forced to build their own stadiums and not use tax dollars for them.
