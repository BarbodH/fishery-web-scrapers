Here are my steps to buying and importing that I posted in a previous thread. Hopefully this will help you.  Here's how it works if you are buying NEW.  1.You are going to have to have a US address or find someone to buy it for you. Dealers won't sell to Canadians and even if they will they need somewhere for the DMV to send the title.  2.Then, you have to wait for the title to come to your address or to the person that bought it.  3.When the title comes (approx 2 weeks), you will then have to fill out a bill of sale from the person that bought it (buying it from them) and fill out the purchase info on the back of the title. If you have a US address you won't have to do this step obviously.  4.You contact U.S. customs and they have a form that they will fax you that you fill out with the title information. You fax it to them 72 hours before you intend to bring it across the border.  5.U.S.Customs will notify you when the title search is done.  6.Bring the machine to the border.  7.Stop on the U.S. side to have the title stamped.  8.Take it to the Canadian side to pay G.S.T. on North American made units. G.S.T.& Duty on Japanese units.  9.You get an import document that you pay $200 for that is sent to Ottawa and you are in.  10.Wait for 2 weeks to get the paperwork on the import document back from Ottawa that you can register your unit.  11.Go to Canadian tire for the out of province inspection (covered in the $200 import fee).  12.Register the unit!  12 easy steps and you save thousands.  If you have time and a way to buy in the U.S. you are home free.  Buying used eliminates several steps obviously."
