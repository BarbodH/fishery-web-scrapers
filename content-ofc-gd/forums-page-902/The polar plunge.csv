300255,Ron,2009-02-01 23:23:00,1683,"Well, what can one say. Doh! Man was it cold. I was tough enough to brave the elements though. We got there around 12:30 and the open hole on the ice was gleaming back at us. I didn't let it bother me, I figured it be best to acclimatize to the surroundings. So, I decided to just hang around with my swim shorts, boots and hat on. Only wimps wear coats in the winter!  Cupcake and myself along with everyones generous contributions, raised $1500.00  on the nose. A great start to our Chapter raising funds for the KTD signs! I wish to thank everyone for contributing. Just remember, (Tom, are you listening?) WE WON""T BE DOING THIS AGAIN!  Cheers, Ron...  "
