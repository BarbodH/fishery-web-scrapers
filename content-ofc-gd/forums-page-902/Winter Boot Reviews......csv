301656,Sinker,2009-02-05 04:20:00,8692, Yes......forgot to mention the extra felt insole on the bottoms.........VERY important part of warm feet.  Sinker
301695,wallyboss,2009-02-05 11:27:00,1095,"I've worked outside for 23 years and icefish all the time and I was looking for a good pair of boots this year. A fishing buddy told me to look at the Baffin Impact. I bought a pair they are the most comfortable boots I ever wore. They are very warm , but the best part is that they are the lightest boots i have ever worn. They are almost lighter than my running shoes.  The secret though is one pair of wool socks in them and that's it. But those boots are the cat's meowww."
301701,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-05 12:01:00,3761,I have thses Columbia winter/hiking boots that are great except for the salt...it makes the laces go hard
301705,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-05 12:19:00,1362,"I own Kamik boots as well....I just replaced the liners last weekend and after 7hrs of fishing in the frigid cold and 5"" of top water my feet were toasty.....I also ONLY wear pure wool socks!"
301706,tinbanger,2009-02-05 12:19:00,1028,Insulated rubber boots (ctc) for me with good socks. Great in the slush. Great when launching the boat early and late season.  so good I bought two pair !  TB
301711,tknohpy,2009-02-05 12:28:00,162,"I just bought the same boots solo, haven't tried them yet"
301716,solopaddler,2009-02-05 12:37:00,8605," They're incredible, hopefully you got the right size though. I normally wear size 11 in boots but had to go to a 13 in these ones. If you're sitting still all day try putting the toe warmer in the small pocket integrated into the boot liners. You won't believe how warm your feet will be."
301719,e-z-out,2009-02-05 12:42:00,1052,"The Baffin Impact boot is a hefty boot for extreme winter weather. When you've got to be out in deep snow and frigid temps, the Impact keeps your feet cush and cozy with GelFlex shock absorbing, insulating soles and removable multi-layer inner boot technology. The double buckle closure provides customizable fit, and won't seize up in the coldest temps north of the 49th. The Impact's insulated upper has a locking snow collar so the white stuff stays outside where it belongs  The cat's meowww  "
301788,spooner_jr,2009-02-05 15:19:00,193,"I bought a pair of these 15 years ago from Barkleys.  Waterproof and warm.  You probably won't want to run a marathon in them, but you can't beat them for ice fishing.  http://www.lacrossefootwear.com/product/co...oots+-+10%22.do"
301856,brkygetr,2009-02-05 18:29:00,425," I have had a pair of Titans for 2 years now and they ROCK! Absolutely the warmest footwear ever. I have put well over 300 hrs (250 last year and close to 100 this year)  just on the ice. In every condition from -40 to standing in 6-8"" slush all day these boots have NEVER failed me. The only part I do not like about them is that they are a little clumsy as they are oversized due to the lining system. Find I kick things or mis-step the odd time. And they are  a wee large to fit under my Mustang suit, can't quite zip the suit right down...though...I just picked up a Helly suit and have no issues as the leg cuffs are bigger. The rating of -100 degrees C. is no joke.  Next to my sled they are the best  ice investment I have made...even more so than the trusty Vexilar. I would be ok with forgeting the Vex but the boots would cause me to turn around!"
301867,danc,2009-02-05 19:03:00,4677,Another vote for Baffins here. I've suffered with cold feet my entire life until I bought my Baffins.
301871,Uncle Buck,2009-02-05 19:12:00,1000,"i bought a pair of boots from Marks work warehouse rated to -70 they have the first 3"" or so rubber, then material with liners(water proof first 3 or 4"")  other pair from bass pro... 1200g thinsulate in only the bottom 3"" or so...the rest are unlined rubber (waterproof all the way up)  I like both but wear the bass pro ones cause it fits easier in my float suit and they're waterproof all the way up  (big feet, size 15...) Bass Pro ones are 14, the Mark's ones are 17  and the bass pro ones are much easier to get in and out of... i can't drive in the marks ones, they're too big, gas and brake go down...  i pair either with the bass pro lifetime warranty socks, and i'm happy..."
302270,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-06 11:27:00,2038,"Speaking of Winter boots.........  Bought a new pair last friday night , tried them out saturday morning very comfortable and kept me toes nice and dry in the 4 inches of water . When i got home i somehow put one boot a little to close to the elctric heater , an hour i could smell rubber        Back to CTC for another pair     Goods boots for the price , just don't put them on the electric heater"
301601,Burtess,2009-02-05 02:47:00,901," Only just over a year late, but what the heck.....  I recently picked up a pair of Baffin Titan's.  I didn't even know they made insulated rubber boots like this!!  Baffin Titan I found them on sale at TSC for $82.49 plus tax (regular $110).  Get a pair before they sell out!  I have not put them through an ice fishing excursion yet but the liner system is NICE!  It consists of a thick layer of ""Polymech"" open cell foam, a layer of felt, and a couple layers of ""vaporized aluminum membrane"".  The inner lining is velvety smooth and very comfortable.  The liner literally wraps around and envelopes your feet.  Rated to - 100°C/-148°F.  The hight of the boot is 14"".  These should be unbeatable with there is a load of slush and water on the ice.  Walking in these boots is not what you would expect.  The heel and toe are angled somewhat to allow for a natural, smooth, rolling movement of the foot, very unlike the clunkiness of cheaper rubber felt packs.  There is no comparing the Titans to the felt pack rubber boots available everywhere for ~$40, these are the real deal.  Below is a pic of the boots, one of the liners pulled out, and the waffle foot bed that is positioned between the liner and the sole of the boot.    Burt"

301611,Moosebunk,2009-02-05 02:59:00,3970,"Best boots ever had were my Mukluks.  White woman came to Rez 5 moons ago.  Made trade.  Boots for 1 hour booty.  Now feet cold and wife locked me out of teepee... Good trade then, no good now.  Lost two toe already.  "
301612,Burtess,2009-02-05 03:01:00,901,She can have my Baffins as well!!  What the hell do you need toes for anyway lol...
301614,ccmtcanada,2009-02-05 03:06:00,7971,"For me, the most important thing is a good first layer sock that wicks away moisture.  Then bulk up after that!"
301615,Bly,2009-02-05 03:08:00,1556,Moose....you are too funny!  Thanks for the chuckle
301617,Sinker,2009-02-05 03:11:00,8692,"For me the most important thing is double knit pure wool socks. ONE pair, inside my crappy tire green rubbers and I'm good to go all day, in temps most people would not go out in.  Just make sure to dry out your liners always. If my feet arent in my boots, the liners are out drying.  Too many socks are NOT good. Most times people will stuff thier boots with too many socks. Its the air space that keeps your feet warm, not all those socks. No airspace=cold feet.  Your better to have cool feet, than hot feet.  IMO, its all in your socks. I wear cheap boots, and have my whole life.  Sinker"
301621,Burtess,2009-02-05 03:18:00,901,"I agree, socks are very important.  The best combo I have found are Wigwam Polypro Liner (http://www.wigwam.com/Products/Gobi-Liner_...b3-001d091bb843) socks under Wigwam ""The Ice Sock"" (http://www.wigwam.com/Products/The-Ice-Soc...b3-001d091bb843).  Burt"
301624,Sinker,2009-02-05 03:20:00,8692,"Find someone who can knit socks. Buy the pure merino wool, and get them to knit you a nice pair. They last forever, and I've never seen any synthetic that can compare. Can't beat pure wool, its tried, tested and true.  Sinker"
