301301,Roy,2009-02-04 14:57:00,13728,Do they want payment in Nigerian funds sent to a barber shop in the UK?
301304,Maverick,2009-02-04 14:59:00,371,"Yeah sounds like one of those scams where the location is *******, ****** . We have the same ad on the North Bay kijiji."
301306,diggyj,2009-02-04 15:01:00,548,"Here's the link.  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-b...QAdIdZ104425474  Could be stolen and just trying to unload it.  Find it amusing that when you click on the map, it puts you right into the middle of a lake......"
301308,MuskieWannabe,2009-02-04 15:11:00,79,"Probably stolen.  A boat like that, that year is worth close to $15,000 if not a bit more...."
301310,Joey,2009-02-04 15:15:00,9122,"Hmmm, if you had a good puter you could zoom in on the vehicle licence place, do some investigating  Joey"
301313,BillM,2009-02-04 15:27:00,17367,US boat for sure.
301318,OhioFisherman,2009-02-04 15:37:00,6623,"If your looking for a bigger boat Florida may be the place to go, repo`s are at a record rate. A story on the news about it Monday? Repo man said they went from 20-25 a month to 150 35-45 footers a month? need the home, need the car, lose the boat!"
301319,PatrickGG,2009-02-04 15:38:00,562,"I think this was the same boats Cudz was talking about a couple weeks back, It's a scam.."
301321,hirk,2009-02-04 15:57:00,571,"Scam,happens in the US on Craigs list/E bay constantly,send me the money and I will ship you the boat lol,ya whatever"
301328,LeXXington,2009-02-04 16:15:00,1928,what you mean they are not sending me the boat!!!!
301363,Cudz,2009-02-04 18:21:00,2652,Yeah.  It is a joke.  I emailed him and he gave me a story of the boat being in Florida but was sold to a dude in Alaska who didn't have the funds but if I send him my name address etc the boat will be mine in 3 days.  Sounds legit.
301367,rob v,2009-02-04 18:31:00,535,"And there's no doubt in my mind there will be more and more of these kinds of scams as people start to look for ""bargins"".   Fools and their money are soon parted."

301478,misfish,2009-02-05 00:01:00,29133," Theres a boat in this state,I have been wanting to buy?"
301635,tdotfisherman,2009-02-05 03:51:00,317,"I sent the seller an email from two different email addresses, and both came back exactly the same, in very automated fashion.. the whole thing smells fishy, and I'm not going to persue it any further.."
301641,Hooked,2009-02-05 03:58:00,891,"Its a scam!  I had interaction with a person via email months ago, and I even posted on here about what to do......about a similar deal.  This case it was a 2007 Sylvan Explorer 1700 DC for under 5K.  However, the person said they now live in Edmonton and would ship to me, but once I started asking about ownership....they stopped emailing me."
301724,sully,2009-02-05 12:49:00,40,"Ads been pulled. I've seen some really good deals on Craigs and Kijiji lately. I'm in the market for a sub 5 grand boat, but most of the good deals are scams  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
301735,Cudz,2009-02-05 13:30:00,2652,"Is it by chance a nice big 20.5' fiberglass walleye boat with a 4 stroke Yammy on it?  I have been looking at it as well.  Sent a pic to my dad but he lives in Alberta.  If it the same one I am looking, buy it. It is a sweet deal.  Repo as well."
