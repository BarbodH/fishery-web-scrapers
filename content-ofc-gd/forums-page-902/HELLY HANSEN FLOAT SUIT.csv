301731,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-05 13:19:00,1362,"I've had my HH Alpha suit for a couple of years now and it's the best bang for your buck!!...I'm 5'11"" 210lbs and have an XL.....the L was tight around the armpits...  If you're going to buy one from Le Barons ($279), I would recommend buying a Le Baron membership card for $25 when you get up to the cash!!  ....this card will get you 10% off on all of your items that you buy there for a full year....right off the bat, the HH suit with the discount will be reduced to $251  And another thing, you really don't have to put layers of clothes on underneath the suit....I normally only wear a long sleeve t-shirt and sweat pants....the suit will keep you extremely warm!!  "
301784,scugpg,2009-02-05 15:11:00,1373," Nice suit! If I put my arms right up over my head it is tight, as with the groin inseam when i do that, but it would still be easy to swim in. The XL just seemed way too big in the chest & shoulders"

276289,BUSTER,2008-12-06 17:06:00,1336,ya iam thinking new is better than hockey bag smell
276291,Bondar,2008-12-06 17:10:00,817,i just bought the HH alpha yesturday at Lebaron with my discount card its a really good deal and its super warm i used it yesturday and today out trouting in the boat and was pretty toasty 
276399,e-z-out,2008-12-06 20:14:00,1052,Thats the same one i have Wiser super warm. Just picked up my new Snow boots Baffin Impact so warm. Now point me in the right direction to get some use out of the gear
276400,Streamerguy,2008-12-06 20:20:00,121,"I just picked up the same one myself last week at LeBaron's for $269 + tax  I also picked up a pair of  irish setter boots thinsulate ultra 800 gram,100% gore-tek for $145. They seem to be pretty warm and no leaks.  Streamerguy"
276405,Mike the Pike,2008-12-06 20:27:00,3421," Buster you would need an XL I am 5 9"" and 195lbs I found a mustang suit too tight in large remember you need to leave some room so you can dress with a couple of layers underneath. Just like others I find the legs too long my arms fit in just fine somehow I ended up with short legs I just titen the velcro around the legs and it stays put.  Don't buy a yellow suit the bird jokes will be flying for the rest of your life"
276409,Streamerguy,2008-12-06 20:30:00,121," Actually the new orange suits you see wiser wearing in the photo comes with a yellow hoodie tucked inside,and a bright yellow it is  Streamerguy"
300748,scugpg,2009-02-03 01:33:00,1373,Hi all - I'm thinking of getting the HH Alpha suit as well. Does anyone have any complaints about it? Sure looks like a nice suit.
300836,douG,2009-02-03 04:08:00,2693,"I think that is the same suit marketed as Nautilus 1000.  It has neoprene cuffs at the sleeve, hand warmer pockets right where they should be, and SUSPENDERS.  If so, that is a great piece of gear.  We like the suspenders."
300841,GBW,2009-02-03 04:16:00,8460,For the price I paid I like my Mustang MS-185.  I have worn it 5 times so far and it's been great (mind you 2 times were test runs with the kids in the snow but hey that still counts )...
300896,walleyemen,2009-02-03 10:42:00,316,"The HH suits are great ,i've had mine for 3 seasons still looks like new, and super warm, my  only problem now is my feet LOL!"
301065,scugpg,2009-02-03 22:55:00,1373,I was really impressed with the Alpha suit when I tried it on. Thanks for the replies
301722,scugpg,2009-02-05 12:47:00,1373,I picked mine up yesterday at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock!  I'm 6'2 205 and a L seemed to fit me a lot better than the XL. From their site at bottom of page in the suit chart http://www.helly.ca/EN/products/sizingChart.cfm
301728,e-z-out,2009-02-05 13:05:00,1052,well now that you have it lets get out on the ice on scugog
