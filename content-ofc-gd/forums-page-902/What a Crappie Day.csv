301179,Drew_10,2009-02-04 02:19:00,111,"Hit up one of my favorite lakes today in search of some Crappie.  The morning was slow, as expected, but we paid attention to any hints the fish would give us so that we would be ready for the evening bite.  We drilled some holes, tried a few different depths, and found a pattern that was working.  Enjoy the pics.  And sorry...the pics are a little big...I'll make em' smaller next time.  We first had to get rid of a couple dink perch    The ultralite set-up was key    The weather was awesome, not much wind.   After doing some searching and learning as much as possible in the morning, the afternoon bite kicked in     My buddy Tadd with a slab   Concentrating on the light bites while watching my other line        The evening bite was great, but it took some searching to find a couple key spots   Fishing stool - a must have   Action Shot       Dinner and Beer "
