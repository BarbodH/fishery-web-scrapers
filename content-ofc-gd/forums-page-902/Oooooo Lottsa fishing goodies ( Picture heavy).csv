301230,nautifish,2009-02-04 04:01:00,1416,"Well i am in the process of re-decorateing my den and turning it into my fishing roon....So this morning i left the house around 11.00am  and set off to Cambridge. The sun was out was a beautiful morning here in dover.  Once i got just the other side of Paris the snow was starting to come down...       Not too bad but i hate driving in snow.....  Arrived at my uncle place around 12.45pm........Sat and yakked for a few hrs... 3.30 came real quick so we packed up my van with all my new goodies... ;D.... I was not looking forward to the drive home lemme tell ya the snow was coming down real good and had been all the time i was at my uncles......So once the van was packed full i headed home.....It never ceases to amaze me how many stupid bloody idiots they're are out there.  The roads were crap....I was driving like Miss Daisey  lol and i don't give a Monkeys..I was not ending up  in no ditch...........This is a hill off of Myers.....As you can see none of the cars could get up this hill....   This poor sod ended up in the playing feild..   Then as i was leaving out of Cambridge this woman lost control of her Vehicle and ended up in the ditch.   I stopped to make sure she was okay and she said someone was on they're way....So i slowly proceeded Home.....Once i got to this side of waterford it was beautiful........Sun was peeking through and no bloody awe full snow....Man am i ever glad i don't live in the snow belt erea.....lol  So once home i opened up my van....   Starting unloading everything....I don't think i will ever have to buy another fishing rod in my life ......lol  These are just a few things my uncle gave me i would be here all night if i photographed everything......lol       I larfed when i found this in one of the tackle boxes...   I was also given this beautiful book on antique fishing lures.....and it is a beauty book...     I luv this book...  I also got a load of fishing nets, tackle boxes, rod holders, fishy stuff to hang in my new fishing room, more lures and hooks and well you name it i probably got it.....lol.....So as much as i really hate driving in winter weather it was worth it....... ;D   Now i have one question....Can someone please tell me what u use a 16' shoreline stalker pole for?  It is an extended telescope rod light action - 5 sec. Never seen one before....It has no eyes or reel this is why i am asking...... :        I am puzzled why it has no eyes on the pole anywhere."
301233,kickingfrog,2009-02-04 04:13:00,8333,I'll take a guess. It looks a bit like a match fishing poll like you would see in Europe. You just tie the line to the end. Not sure though.   Neet stuff!
301235,Cudz,2009-02-04 04:19:00,2652,"The pole is probably a crappie rod.  You can reach over lilly pads and drop bait anywhere in between them.  Are you British?  Some of the language you use suggest that you are.  By the way, nice fishing stuff for the room!  I too laughed at the lube."
301236,kemper,2009-02-04 04:35:00,2232,"I have a very similar Dame, Stoddard and Kendall box at home, with some antique lures in it. No idea where it came from though"
301239,nautifish,2009-02-04 04:41:00,1416,  Nope not British.....Canadian born.  ...I just sound like a limey!....Well actually i get told more i sound like a auzzy.....SO who knows.  .....lol
301240,nautifish,2009-02-04 04:43:00,1416,  Its a nice Box kEMPER I REALLY LIKE IT.....Going to fill it with fishing mags......lol...   I'll ask my uncle where he got his....
301247,rbaquial,2009-02-04 05:43:00,968,"HOLY SMOKES BATMAN!! And I thought I HAD a LOT OF RODS/REELS!!  hahaha ...My ""Addiction"" pales in comparison to you....haha"
301250,bassjnkie,2009-02-04 05:54:00,1101,"  Americans call it a crappie pole, the British call it a whip. I have a hole bunch of them I use for carp. There are no eyes, but you attach an eye on the top section, then your line is tied directly to the eye."
301255,danc,2009-02-04 06:44:00,4677,"  That's to keep stalkers away. If you use it correctly, they won't get within 16' of you.  Quite the haul there Nauti. Can't wait to see the finished project."
301265,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-04 08:34:00,1183,Oh Naughty....that is naughty...I just love it when I woman has more.  I am so with you in regards to winter driving....those are the kinda days that make me cuss.  Glad you made it home with your loot.
301270,mepps,2009-02-04 12:06:00,1301,"Wow, thats a serious collection!"
301273,solopaddler,2009-02-04 12:34:00,8605,"What a haul, lucky you!"
301283,Greencoachdog,2009-02-04 13:30:00,8163,"Lotsa great  stuff there Nauti!!!  I'll give you $5 US for that lure book right now!  The 16' pole should have a wire loop at the end to tie your line to. Some folks use them down here for Crappie fishin', you can fish around the branches of a tree that has fallen into the water with minimal hang ups... drop your line straight down, no bites in a minute, lift your line straight up! The 16' length give you enough distance from the fish as to not spook them."
301296,Mike Pike,2009-02-04 14:46:00,1332,"Of course you realize you'll have to show us pics of that fishing room when it's all done too, eh!  Good luck, Nauti.  A really cool collection of fishing stuff to be sure!"
301300,diggyj,2009-02-04 14:51:00,548,Great pics of your fishing loot. Looks like you will be busy. Keep us posted.
301305,joonmoon,2009-02-04 14:59:00,528,"Hey Nauti, looks like you're gonna have yur mitts full for a while organizing and setting up yur fishin den. AWESOME, can't wait to see the finished result. Winter wasn't meant to drive a car in, just ice fishing...lol."
301312,Joey,2009-02-04 15:19:00,9122,"Wow, that's awesome Tracy, what a haul  Joey"
301334,LeXXington,2009-02-04 16:47:00,1928,Very nice haul.  bite your tongue never have to buy another rod.  HA you always need to by another rod regardless how many you have.
301337,rbaquial,2009-02-04 16:55:00,968," HAHA!! No kidding, no matter HOW MUCH you REALLY DON'T NEED IT... you always seem to come up with a VALID REASON WHY you need it...well, at least I do!"
301342,nautifish,2009-02-04 17:07:00,1416,lol.....Actually that is not all my rods & reels....Those are just what was given to me by my uncle yesterday.

301349,shane,2009-02-04 17:38:00,652,"  Haha!  You're going to have to get up early to get there before me!  Actually, you're in a much better area than me for that kind of stuff so you could do very well.  Good hunting."
