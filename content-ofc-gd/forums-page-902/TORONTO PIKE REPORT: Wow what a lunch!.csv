301555,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-05 02:06:00,2585,nice good on you for getting out there!  cheers!
301575,Moosebunk,2009-02-05 02:25:00,3970,"That kind of fishing seems such a long way off.  Great efforts SNAG, some quality fun and fish."
301623,Bly,2009-02-05 03:19:00,1556, That might explain a few things  LOL  Great report Snag and beauty Pike      Thanks also for the reminder of what open water looks like
301654,snag,2009-02-05 04:18:00,1932," Gracias Bunk, I actually had to wait for an hour for ice to drift out of the bay so that I could cast!   Thanks Carole,  Aluminum brings out my eyes  An adventure with you and CCMT is due. "
301762,Bly,2009-02-05 14:41:00,1556,  Definitely!  I missed out last season and do not intend to let that happen again.
301774,ehg,2009-02-05 15:00:00,2666,"Nice report Grant, those are some real EARLY in the season T.O pike. Looks like lunchtime on milder days with Rapala husky jerks might bring some pike for those willing to try. Great stuff as usual from you."
301803,mepps,2009-02-05 15:56:00,1301,Awesome stuff! I'll be in Toronto for opener in May - be there or be square(er)!
301927,snag,2009-02-05 20:54:00,1932, It will be done. Please be gentle.   Thanks Erik. I was suprised where they came from. Let me know if you want the location.   You're going down Meeps

301944,snag,2009-02-05 21:24:00,1932,Day after superbowl face.
302195,limeyangler,2009-02-06 04:20:00,5204,"Thats just not natural SNAG...open water in February   Just Kiddin'   that looks like good fun, always a bonus when the action is hot when you kinda aint expecting it be....nice snotrockets for sure!"
302207,Jigger,2009-02-06 04:36:00,1237,"I think before you put your foil liner on, you wrap the pike up and then put it on. Its the only way you can be so...ON with the pikies. Whatever it is, you're on pace for another banner year. Thanks for sharing and congrats on the top 5er!"
301369,snag,2009-02-04 18:40:00,1932,"Had the best Lunch hour of fishing that I’ve had for a loooong time!! If only I was at this spot all day! Could’ve been historical! It was spring hungry pike in February!  Oddly, Both large pike Inhaled the lures and I was fishing them unusually fast for this time of year   Made a nice hike in,    I’ve run into this older Eastern European angler a couple times. I thought I had the place to myself, but he appeared after my first 3 pike of the day. He knows all the spots and shared some great stories. Sadly, after some conversation, he’s seen a decline in pike numbers in the last 10 years. In addition, we both noticed a strange disappearance of perch too? Hopefully, it’s just natures cycle……….  We walked across the ice to another spot where he caught a few that morning. (He didn’t want his pic taken and made me promise that I would not share, or post his spots)       The previous Friday I hit this spot and caught a nice one. Here is the one and only shot. I lost her, thank my goodness  Well, fortunately/unfortunately I didn’t have her hooked well and after a few shakes she was off.  You see, as I was fighting her, I looked around at the shoreline and realized I couldn’t get close enough without slipping on the icey rocks!   I promised I'd be back, better prepared......   3 days later,  The day was such a nice day and if my calculations were correct, The pike should be on!   Headed out to find the hospitable shoreline Looks O.k. but don't be fooled. The rocks that are visible either have clear ice on them or are under 6"" of water. I still got 2 soaker's trying not to fall right in.    First cast produced a plastic replica of discouragement. (even with nice scenery, Toronto fishing reminds you exactly where you are!)   Second cast was a shocker!   This first one hit around 12pm. A nice fatty with a great fight.   (It was so bright that the photos got pretty washed out at certain angles.)   Then I tried a new spot on a point 10min. later This next one was the biggest. Definitely in my top Toronto 5. (crap photo, sorry) My line starts peeling and I can feel the weight. As she gets closer I can see she’ inhaled the lure. So now I have a big fish that will need surgery.      With the tools ready, surgery was a bloodless success and she was back in pronto! I was impressed with myself because all 3 trebles were stuck deep in her mouth.  Then another 10-15min. later I get another hit!! This was a bit smaller but a great fighter too. Again, this one inhaled the lure.      Surgery went well, there was a bit of blood but all gill rakes were intact. She swam off strong.  It’s important to have your tools accessible!   I had to get back to work so my friend and I went back to his spot where he caught a few that morning. We had a couple nice follows but they had stopped feeding at that point. My friend said he was coming back again for the evening feed to get some more.  I wished him luck, thanked him, shook hands and departed.   What an Hour! (Well it was actually 40min.)     This guys day, Not so good......        Caught this guy walking with a box covered in tinfoil on his head. Lundboy?    See you later, Alligators.  "
301374,capt bruce,2009-02-04 18:59:00,820,"Great job Snag , had some luck last week on a lunch hour cast and eat. (cast and eat = One 12 inch sub and a walk along the waTER FRONT THROWING MY X-RAP TO ANY OPEN SPOTS Along the way , people in my office think im nuts takeing a fishing rod out to lunch) didnt reconize you when I walked past with my tin foil box .I would have stopped to chat but the aliens moniter that area alot and I was afriad of getting captured even with my ray stopping head gear ,maybe another time ."
301377,snag,2009-02-04 19:12:00,1932,I've downsized to wrapping my baseball hat in foil. Some signals get through but they're managable.
301379,solopaddler,2009-02-04 19:17:00,8605,"Great job bud, dems some nice esox!"
301381,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-04 19:25:00,2050,"man you totally rock the TO pike... thanks for the pics snag...bring on ice-out baby...this hard stuff is totally crampin' my style... you just gave me the softwater bug...  cheers, UF"
301384,BillM,2009-02-04 19:34:00,17367,Good job man!!! I always look forward to your early softwater reports!
301386,douG,2009-02-04 19:35:00,2693,"Very nice, Snag.  Bruce, remember to wear it with the shiny side out.  Otherwise, you just look silly."
301387,diggyj,2009-02-04 19:35:00,548,Sweet report and some great looking pike. Nice. Care to share a liitle moe info about that spot?  Roughly what area of the waterfront?  Is that someones sailboat that sank?
301394,snag,2009-02-04 19:54:00,1932,"Thanks Guys,  It was good to have the beasts so willing to visit the shore.  Albeit briefly.  Hope that's a sign of this years fishing!"
301395,bigugli,2009-02-04 19:56:00,6138,WTG Snag. Some nice pike there.  It's amazing what you can find along the Toronto waterfront. Just have to do a little backpacking.
301396,snag,2009-02-04 19:56:00,1932, Yes
301398,nautifish,2009-02-04 20:03:00,1416,Great Report Snag.....I have yet to get into my 1st pike for 09........
301400,johnnyb,2009-02-04 20:18:00,3413,Nicely done!!  Nothin' like a little lunch time quickie
301403,Leecher,2009-02-04 20:22:00,7832,"Congratulations Snag     Beautiful gators  Fun times, active fish and beauty day.... doesn't get any better than that!!  Again good job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
301414,tbayboy,2009-02-04 20:59:00,1497,"MY BOAT!  AHHHHH!.  Nah, I wish I had a boat nice enough to sink on the waterfront .  Nice fish there Snag - glad to hear you didn't slide all the way in, those rocks looked slippery."
301416,Joey,2009-02-04 21:14:00,9122,"Awesome report Snag.  Those pike are gorgeous  Poor sap's boat, that sucks.  ]  Joey"
301422,tdotfisherman,2009-02-04 21:23:00,317,"Those two Northerns are HUGE! Great report.. but please tell me those weren't caught today? In -13 weather? If thats the case you have magical powers or something. I'm going to finally get out next Tuesday because I have the day off, and this report for sure will keep me motivated to keep casting, thanks Snag!"
301423,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-04 21:24:00,3761,"Cool report, im going pike fishing in the start of march and would using HJ's like you were using work well in a river mouth situation?  Thanks for sharing!!"
301464,Greencoachdog,2009-02-04 23:18:00,8163,YFS!!!
301480,rockfish,2009-02-05 00:02:00,91,"Great report Snag, I've tried the TO waterfront a few times at ice out and before the Apr 1 close but haven't had much luck, just not walkin enough I guess.  Winter and early Spring piking see the biggest brutes."
301483,kickingfrog,2009-02-05 00:08:00,8333,"Carefull, that boat is for sale on kiijji or whatever."
301487,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-05 00:19:00,1183,"That was a fun read...nice fish...nice pics too....but, what's wrong with yer face???"
301543,snag,2009-02-05 01:57:00,1932," It's coming, I was a little suprised myself.   Even had a smoke afterwords!   It was the perfect day brother, amen!   If there were bottles of SKREECH floating around I might believe it was your boat!   No, you're gorgeous!!   No, that was on Monday. 2 or -2, 10km wind, sunny. Tuesdays long range is looking good! Good luck!!   Hey Mike,  Definately, try back bays where they will be searching for spawning grounds. Rivers will be moving pretty fast and water can be murky. Good luck.   I'm waiting with my Dixie cup? what's up??   If this is any indication, this year may be fantastic. These pike were hungry and aggressive."
301551,msp,2009-02-05 02:02:00,1336,Nice clean lookin pikers. Thanks for the report . Plus temps expected this weekend !!! Spring is just around the corner.
301552,snag,2009-02-05 02:03:00,1932," Craigslist too.   My face?  Well, I find that my rugged good looks distract the viewing audience from the esox. I was going to scar my face with a scaler, but blurring is easier!  Actually, I've been recognized a few times while fishing and I'm not thrilled with it."
