301639,tdotfisherman,2009-02-05 03:56:00,317,"Yeah, it was a great show.. I've probably seen every episode from the first two seasons of the program.. i've learned a lot about urban fishing, and fishing close to Toronto from the program.. the last I heard the show was renamed to ""Shaun Rickard's Outdoor Adventures"".. anyway, I could have sworn that the host of the show has posted on this site a few times.. Anyway, if a new season airs, I will look forward to it.."
