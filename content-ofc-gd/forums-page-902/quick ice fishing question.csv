301527,purekgw,2009-02-05 01:38:00,585,Ok well friday morning we are heading to simcoe we have rented a hut out there but if fridays going to be nice i wouldnt mind fishing out side but i got no auger. So if i bring a hatchet what are the chances of finding some ones old hole that i can get through?
301530,bigugli,2009-02-05 01:50:00,6138,"You'd be better off with a long crowbar with a straight edge, better yet a spud. Cold nights make thick ice in new holes. A lot of hut operators are usually willing to cut extra holes"
301534,purekgw,2009-02-05 01:54:00,585,do they drill the holes in the huts when they drop you off or are they pre-drilled?
301592,Sinker,2009-02-05 02:40:00,8692,"They're pre drilled. Usually, they're just a big square hole in the ice.......you can use a landing net to get your fish....   Who are you going out with? Most operators will drill you a few holes if you ask.  Sinker"
301597,purekgw,2009-02-05 02:43:00,585,Its randys fish huts that we are going with
301626,Sinker,2009-02-05 03:25:00,8692,"Just ask him before  you head out. Most times its not a problem......just make sure he knows before you head out, he might not bring an auger if you don't ask.  Sinker"
