301561,Skud,2009-02-05 02:13:00,739,The curse is broken. I have been ice fishing on Simcoe since I was 5 and I just caught my first Laker today.  I probably only put in about 4 to 5 days a season into fishing for Simcoe trout and Whities but after 30 years that adds up. It has even been about 5 years since my last Whitey. But venturing out today from BBP in the cold paid off. A tube jig in about 90 fow was the ticket. Now I can go back to fishing for perch. 
301563,Terry,2009-02-05 02:15:00,14456,nice going
301565,rbaquial,2009-02-05 02:15:00,968,"Awesome!!  Congrats!!  Although, I've been noticing a pattern with ICE-FISHERMAN... Do the fish bleed-out THAT MUCH during ice-fishing?!"
301567,misfish,2009-02-05 02:18:00,29133,"Ah thats nutt,n. I still remember that pike in 60fow ya caught..Now that was a story to be told.  Congrats Doug."

301578,Leecher,2009-02-05 02:29:00,7832,Congratulations Skud Real nice looking laker Leechman
301582,douG,2009-02-05 02:35:00,2693,"Attaboy, Doug.  Your Simcoe record is one better than mine.  That is a purdy laker.  I think sometimes the fish get beat up being pulled from the hole, and whitefish have fragile mouths, so that might explain the colour on the ice when they are landed."
301620,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-05 03:17:00,3761,Congrads on your first lake trout. I hope I will be able to catch one before i hit 30 years of fishing lol.  Thanks for sharing

302135,Skud,2009-02-06 03:03:00,739,Thanks Ladies and Gents. I am going to give it another go tomorrow afternoon and maybe even Sat afternoon. Let's see if the warmer temps put the fish in a biting mood.
302136,purekgw,2009-02-06 03:05:00,585,you can use bass tubes for lakers? nice fish by the way maybe i get 1 tomorrow!
302229,Cudz,2009-02-06 05:19:00,2652,Nice job Skud If I read your report correctly that puts you at 35 years oldish.  Are you originally from Barrie?  Just wondering if you are a Barrie boy from back in the day.  I am just a couple years older so we may know each other.  Congrats on the laker. I just moved my hut to BBP area.  Glad to see you had a result there.
302236,MuskyBill,2009-02-06 05:29:00,311,"I sense a 'ScudsnCudz' report soon!  Great looking Laker, Scud, a real beauty...."
