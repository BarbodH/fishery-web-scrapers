Double click on an area, then use the scroll bars to move elsewhere in the image, or if you have a scroll wheel on your mouse, use that. Or use the zoom controls on the top left hand side. The detail is amazing. You can find some of the places where the images were stitched together.  http://gigapan.org/viewGigapanFullscreen.p...6648c2b4b06233c"

302118,Mattones,2009-02-06 02:31:00,587,I saw a couple people with their heads chopped into another persons head. Must be when they editted the pictures.  Crazy stuff. I saw something like that with another major event.
