Nothing like going through your Moms stuff and finding out she had filled her pension Papers a year before her 65th Birthday.  The Poor old lady was looking forward to it.  Never had time to grieve as their affairs, well weren't in order.  Both were also seperated so I had to do everything.  My Dad twice because they wouldnt bury him in Quebec till spring as he died in Feb.  Pure Hell for me.  Last week me and my wife were almost set to go back East for a second time within a year as her Mom came close."
