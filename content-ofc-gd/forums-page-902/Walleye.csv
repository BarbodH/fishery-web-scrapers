Mornings have been best for us and jigging is outproducing set lines 3:1.      My buddy Graham with one from his set line.           Pretty good numbers of fish but we didn't see one over 22"" the last 2 days.  I know I keep saying this but it's getting close to trout time.  Hopefully by the weekend we'll get out after them.  Tight lines all,  Ben"

301683,ctdd2006,2009-02-05 05:53:00,531,Being from a walleye starved area yet  a trout  infested area I often laugh how I crave the eyes yet you (not you personally)at times hunt what we call grease ballls!  lol   I refuse to fish lakers and only target the square tails and get them in abundance and pay money to fish perch and walleye!  Funny!
