1086172,glen,2023-07-28 13:48:00,2641,Slow speed (1.5mph) lake trout lure.   	j plug vs flatfish ? Any other body baits ?
1086173,CrowMan,2023-07-28 14:11:00,413,"One of my favourite Laker set ups is running a ""peanut lure"" (like a mini KwikFish) 30"" behind a 6"" Williams Whitefish (as opposed to a full-size dodger or cow bells). It trolls nicely at 1.5 mph. Also a Rapala J-11 or J-13 trolls effectively at slow speeds.  "

1086179,glen,2023-07-28 22:24:00,2641,Ok I have a list of ideas. Thanks.
1086183,dave524,2023-07-29 16:25:00,4508,Luhr Jensen Fireplugs were a favourite of mine behind a smaller Cow Bell when we didn't have real meat behind.
1086190,BillM,2023-07-30 01:49:00,17367,Flutter spoon like a Sutton would be my first choice.   Also pump the rod as well..
1086192,misfish,2023-07-30 18:23:00,29133,I was trying to remember the name. Sutton are great as well. 
1086193,Fang,2023-07-30 21:27:00,1330,Just back from a week on Temagami. Trolling speeds varied from 1.1 up to 2.0 but 1.8 was sweet spot. Small gang trolls from lucky strike in front of Michigan stinger spoons with 5 ft leads. UV’s chartreuse and glow greens took majority of fish. Also ran clean Sutton spoons and small meat rigs side by side and gang troll/spoon still won. Nothing big but good numbers up to 5 lbs. That lake has huge numbers still and ran into very few other boats trolling. Most were jigging and that worked too for a few.
