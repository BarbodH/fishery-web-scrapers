1086152,siwash,2023-07-25 01:03:00,683,"Hey gang,  Angler's Atlas says there are 3 launches (all in the south east corner neat FF)  -  which to chose from the three?   Hoping the launches put me on to some decent fishing (multi species)  Thoughts?  "
1086153,BillM,2023-07-25 04:19:00,17367,What's Google Maps say?
1086154,siwash,2023-07-25 11:32:00,683,"I found a ""cameron lake boat ramp"" but when  I searched it further, a recent review came up said there's a really strong current at this launch making it very challenging to put in or take out a boat. I've come across some other info about a launch at the end of West St. North but that's not on google maps."
1086155,BillM,2023-07-25 13:11:00,17367,The public dock in Fenlon Falls is probably what I'd be using after a quick search.
1086171,big guy,2023-07-28 13:47:00,414,"Its only strong when they have the dam open and thats not the case right now. They rebuilt the concrete ramp a few years back, its a bit of a weird place for a ramp but its a good one and there are a few places to park."
1086181,siwash,2023-07-29 12:31:00,683," From there, where would you search for fish?  We aren't targeting anything specific..  walleye, bass, etc... I hear there are pike there too now.."
1086182,CrowMan,2023-07-29 13:17:00,413,Do you have Navionics or a hydrographic chart ? Lots of sunken humps and reefs surrounded by deeper water on Cameron. That's where I'd start.
1086194,siwash,2023-07-30 21:34:00,683,Will do... need to order a map.
1086195,CrowMan,2023-07-30 23:12:00,413,"Just download Navionics, if you don't have it on your sonar...   "
1086196,siwash,2023-07-31 11:10:00,683,Thanks Crowman!  I have a very basic unit so can't download it.  Much appreciated
1086197,CrowMan,2023-07-31 11:27:00,413,Just to clarify...you can download the Navionics app to your phone....you don't even need a sonar unit.
1086198,siwash,2023-07-31 11:32:00,683,"Didn't know that! Thanks, man!"
1086199,siwash,2023-07-31 12:22:00,683,"I loaded the app... looks great.  gives you an option to download a map to use while offline.  I tried to download an area, but where does it download to?  I checked my phone's downloads and it wasn't there.. Also search inside the app."
1086216,siwash,2023-08-03 02:53:00,683,"App worked great but launch didn't! Ended up at Balsam via the rosedale launch. The launch at Cameron has virtually no parking! Three spots and they were taken. I got there early afternoon but still, I expected a bigger parking area. That lake is basically inaccessible. Is there any other way in? I tried a launch just to the south west but it is private. No public access"
1086218,big guy,2023-08-03 15:54:00,414,"people park on streets near the launch area when busy. Fenelon marina has a pay launch for 10 bucks, but you also have to park along the street a bit farther away."
1086224,siwash,2023-08-04 02:23:00,683,Interesting... I didn't see much room for more trailer parking.. I'll keep it in mind for next time.  I really wanted to fish this lake.  Heard good things.  Balsam was a bust. One fish on - not a bad one - lost after 10 sec fight.  Then one perch!
