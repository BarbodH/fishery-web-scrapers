1086037,AKRISONER,2023-07-10 12:26:00,5558,It’s nice you think BPS and Cabela’s still have quality tackle 😂
1086038,CrowMan,2023-07-10 13:00:00,413,"The big box retailers have become so out of touch with current enthusiast trends...that it's to the point that the Crappy Tire in the west end of Kingston has a better selection of (in store) baits than BPS. Whoever the purchasing manager is at this particular CT store, they really know their stuff. This store is no regular CT...3 full aisles of soft plastics alone...including brands like MegaBass, Keiteck and JackAll...also LuckyCraft, Duo and EverGreen hard baits...even an aquarium with game fish in the middle of the store. This is one location that ain't that crappy.. "
1086039,AKRISONER,2023-07-10 14:11:00,5558,"Like to me its apparent, CT and BP, they cater to the guy that wants to go fishing a couple of times while hes at the cottage. However I truly believe that its a failing business structure and it wont be long before they go out of business. If you go to BP, its noticeable, the place is far too empty for such a gigantic floor space and the quality of set up/inventory has greatly suffered. There is only so many lead weights and bobbers and $80 fishing combos you can sell to people IMO. Literally every single person thats been to a lake has an old tackle box loaded with junk fishing gear. You might sell the crap one time to somebody but theres no need for them to ever replenish their supply. Meanwhile the guys that are actually getting at it every week need high quality tackle and are constantly spending money on high ticket merchandise, the kind of stuff that would actually keep a store open.  Heck whats the profit margin on the $140 swimbait I just bought from Peterborough Pro Tackle? Surely thats a more profitable venture than selling BPS branded junk crank baits to the guy going to the cottage for the long weekend?  Either way, the only complaint that I have is that for whatever reason, Gagnon's, Peterborough Pro Tackle and Pro J are all bloody east of the GTA. Like am I crazy or is there a massive opportunity for someone to open something West/North of the city? Or do we simply not like bassin enough once you are too far from the kawarthas. Would rather shop from a local independently owned retailer than the walmart of fishing anyways. Finally, No hate to Jasper at PRO J or the boys at Gagnons, but after my most recent visit to PPT...man, they might be running one of the best tackle shops in north America at the moment. Ive had the pleasure of visiting a few of the big shops down in the states, and they arent even on PPT's level. Their selection and brands they are carrying now...geeez mind blown."
1086040,CrowMan,2023-07-10 14:44:00,413,"Yeah, not sure why there's no retailer worth going out of the way to north of the GTA....I guess the rich folks with their McMansions in Muskoka just dont fish much.. However, west of the GTA, Fishing World in Hamilton and Natural Sports in Kitchener are always worth a stop. With a home in Oakville and a cottage in Frontenac, I'm  pretty fortunate as Pro J, Gagnons and PPT can all be en route. JB's is also not bad. And that CT store in Kingston gets a lot of my money too.. As for shops south of the border, If you ever make it out to Phoenix, visit Hook Up Tackle...between the inventory and the knowledge of the sales staff...all I can say is WOW !"
1086041,siwash,2023-07-10 15:14:00,683,where do you buy your tackle? I'm looking for better sources.  Online?
1086042,AKRISONER,2023-07-10 16:14:00,5558,Peterborough Pro Tackle. Their online store is really good too.   RE: The hookup tackle...apparently they are number one in the world and are a bass boat central sponsor. I just never shop with them because its american. They truly have almost everything you can image. I fairly often get extremely annoyed at how hard it can sometimes be to get stuff here in canada. I recently was simply trying to find 8 strand braid in colours other than moss green and it was nearly impossible. Drives me insane.
1086045,misfish,2023-07-10 21:03:00,29133,They have owner hooks and all the senkos he will need.
1086046,misfish,2023-07-10 21:05:00,29133,"SIWASH, Another option is to hit all the bass club spring tackle swaps that happen. Lots of deals to be had. "
1086055,misfish,2023-07-10 23:40:00,29133,"Fishing in Canada vs fishing in the USA is a whole different thing. I do not know if it is mind set or the amount of fishing or the amount of people that love fishing. I am on many fly fishing sites on FB. Guess which has more? USA. Those guys down there are right into it. Up here,I have found a handful and they are not that great. Yes, there are the east coast and west coast ones,but in the USA,they are everywhere throughout the states.  This is why BPS and Cabelas and small stores thrive down there and not up here. I was peed off when Sails closed in Vaughan. They had a much better selection then BPS.  And YES, ONLINE shopping is killing small shops here. I have finally got on the online shoppping. Lots of my supplies come from BC and some from up in northern ont. I have even ordered from Montana now,as I cannot get a better price for my leg material for my bugs."
1086056,siwash,2023-07-11 01:17:00,683,Online shopping isn t killing them - they just need to adapt. Maybe the traditional walk up store will be gone but the retailer will have to adapt.
1086057,AKRISONER,2023-07-11 02:35:00,5558,Peterborough pro tackle has an unbelievable online store. The problem is that you lose the experience of browsing all of their incredibly rare imported tackle from Japan. They had stuff I’d never even dream of looking up. I could spend hours In there.
1086060,Dan668,2023-07-11 12:52:00,1120,"Echo the above. I ordered for the first time from PPT. Normally I have to run around or place multiple orders everywhere, but they literally had everything under one roof. Including all the tackle that is currently hot and hard to find."
1085809,CrowMan,2023-06-20 17:41:00,413,"I like  at least a 6 to 7 ft FC leader in clear water....actually even longer...I like the knot to be on the reel when landing the fish. I use the FG most of the time. It's the slimmest and strongest connection by far. A little tricky to learn...but I now use a ""FG Knot Assist Tool""...I posted about it on here a while back. Other knots that a lot of folks use are ""Back to Back Uni"" knots or the ""Alberto""."
1085810,siwash,2023-06-20 18:26:00,683,One thing that stresses me out is if I have to re-tie these connection knots while in the water.  Always a lot harder  I find. Thanks
1085818,AKRISONER,2023-06-20 22:29:00,5558,"I’m going to counter what crow says because I have issues with my hands and therefore don’t bother even attempting to tie the fg knot. because I’m stuck tying a double uni I typically tie a leader as long as I am willing to cast without the knot going through the top eyelet. I guess 24 inches is long enough. the double uni is so bloody easy to tie, that even I can tie it with cold raynauds syndrome hands.  they literally never fail. Your line will break long before a uni knot fails."
1085820,siwash,2023-06-20 22:40:00,683,I'll give the uni a try then!! I like simplicity!
1085821,siwash,2023-06-21 00:27:00,683, So are you keeping the leaders short because the double uni doesn't go through the top eyelet?  Or can the leader length be longer?
1085825,OhioFisherman,2023-06-21 02:45:00,6623,"The guys on tactical bass are using what they call a modified blood knot, just 10 or 12 per side wraps compared to 5 or 6 on a normal blood knot."
1085826,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 04:50:00,5558,"You can tie it longer for sure, it just doesn’t go through the eyelets like an fg  my logic, is that for bass? They aren’t line shy at all from experience. A few feet of fluro 2-3 feet is enough to be invisible at the bait. The braided line doesn’t seem to bother them in the water, heck largemouth live amongst weeds they can’t tell braid from the weeds surrounding them. The only thing I will tie longer is a drop shot rig, that’s less of a rig I’m hoping to absolutely bomb casts with though so it works. my other complaint about the fg is that it’s a knot that needs to be masterfully tied or it will fail. You can ask my tournament partner about that one. We have a very innapropriate name for the knot now after it lost some giants for us. I see it fail so often that I just can’t trust it. Although the same can be said with most knots, there’s usually some feel to get them just right."
1085828,siwash,2023-06-21 10:31:00,683,May also experiment with the Alberto knot...  And I will be trying out a drop shot rig too...  Thanks!
1085832,CrowMan,2023-06-21 12:50:00,413,"For me the Alberto is easier than the double uni...once you pinch the looped leader in one hand, you're just wrapping the braid around it...no switching hands. The Alberto slides pretty easily through your guides...if you ever fish Spybaits, you'll appreciate having a very long (20 to 30ft) FC leader. For the record, I can honestly say I've never had an FG knot fail, but I'm pretty meticulous about tying my knots...must be my experience as a Queen Scout some 50 years ago...lol"
1085834,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 13:12:00,5558,"I actually might start playing with the Alberto…how do you find it for actually holding? also I’m just going to throw this in here because I spent years playing with knots looking for simplicity due to my hands, but when it comes to tying fluro or mono to your hook, I swear there is not better knot than the Eugene knot. I find it so simple to tie because once you pinch the lead, you just wrap and can grab ahold of the loop at all times. getting the tension perfect of the tag end does take some refinement, but that knot is one where if you didn’t tie it right, it’s obviously visible and you don’t literally feel it lock. When done right you always get the same result and it’s literally bulletproof and never failed me once.  also, this is how you tie a drop shot, I saw this video and never looked back  https://fb.watch/liItm9kDyk/?startTimeMs=2000&mibextid=v7YzmG"
1085836,CrowMan,2023-06-21 13:40:00,413,"Again, never had an Alberto fail. Most tests I've seen rank the breaking of the Alberto much stronger than a Double Uni. I find the Double Uni can be problematic if the braid and leader are of very different diameters...like making a Pike leader of 15lb braid to 60lb FC...or if you're using a slick fused braid like NanoFil (oh I miss you). Can't say I've had any experience with the Eugene...90% of the time I'm tying a Palomar...it's just so quick, easy and fool-proof. It's what I use for the drop shot tòo...I find that the double loops of line through the hook eye help support the hook in an upright position...and yes, I always run the tag end down through the eye again If you can tie the Eugene, the Alberto should be a piece of cake..basically the same thing..pinch and wrap"
1085837,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 14:00:00,5558,"so heres the catch with the palomar...it burns light fluro and is prone to breaking. I went through it for a few years thinking I was getting bit off, and once again ive then watched my tournament partner be adamant that he is getting it off...but then spending too much time with him fishing on the tri-lakes no one hooks into musky that often. The thing is that the line always breaks clean to so it can be mistaken for a bite off, however speaking from experience, when you actually get bit off, typically the break is very very unclean and your line looks more shreaded than purely cut. Yes hes always extremely careful to not twist the line and ensure that it has clean grab ahold of everything, the knot gets so tight on a hard hookset it literally cuts itself."
1085838,CrowMan,2023-06-21 14:42:00,413,"Can't say I've personally experienced that with the Palomar. Usuallly if the knot fails, the remaining tag end will be slightely deformed or there'll be a little curly-cue.  Pike and Musky teeth can be like razors...a very clean slice. Even a hammer-handle can leave you ""piked"". Any knot can fail, but If you don't cross the line and you lubricate the knot, the Palomar is as bulletproof as it gets. Your partner may be crossing the line, that's really the only way it can cut itself: https://www.wired2fish.com/fishing-knots/2-tips-to-avoid-palomar-knot-failure-with-fluorocarbon/ I can't  imagine between the give of the rod and the drag on the reel of breaking a properly tied knot on the hook set...although with chemically sharpened hooks these days my hook sets are more of a flick of the wrist, than an over the head reef. Anyway, there's 100's of knots out there, all with proponents as the best...for me at my age it comes down to muscle memory...my fingers just go into automatic mode, so I just stick with the old fav's."
1085843,siwash,2023-06-21 18:46:00,683,So are these knots best for similar diameter lines or can they work well with varying widths?
1085847,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 22:33:00,5558,"Palomar knots truthfully are so bloody easy to tie and basically work with all diameters of line. to a point, when using heavier gauge fluro for pike leaders etc I will tie it to connect to my lure. I like the eugene knot for fluro under 20lbs. the number one reasonwhy I use these knots are they are what I’m able to tie when I lose dexterity in my fingers essentially any time the air temperature is below 10 degrees C (raynauds syndrome is a PITA) once again I simply complain about breakage. With the palomar knot, but to each his own. Learn the knot though, there are many times you will be fishing with straight braid, frogging, flipping, throwing a jig at cover, heck even whack rigging if you are fishing pads…in that case just run a palomar knot with straight braid and give err"
1085856,siwash,2023-06-22 10:08:00,683,What do you guys think of these kits? Seems like a good deal... 
1085857,AKRISONER,2023-06-22 11:42:00,5558,Basically everything in that kit except the weights looks useless  i don’t know why you’d wanna drop shot with a giant ewg looking hook. No idea why they have some weird looking nail weights then there’s no need for swivels or snaps to drop shot. go to Canadian tire and get some gamakatsu drop shot hooks in size 2 and some drop shot weights in 1/4 and call it a day. Should cost you about $15
1085895,akaShag,2023-06-25 12:46:00,2073,Interesting.  I have had a LOT more success with an unweighted hook.

1085902,siwash,2023-06-26 01:35:00,683,Tried a wacky this weekend on the French. To be honest I didn't give it enough time and the presentation wasn't perfect. I did catch a fish with it! A rock bass 🤣  What are your favourite senko style colours?
1085903,AKRISONER,2023-06-26 01:56:00,5558,"Like anything, I keep it very simple when it comes to colours. Senkos, brownish, green tones. Green pumpkin and whatever flake fits your fancy."
1086021,msp,2023-07-09 02:31:00,1336,True. It can be a very frustrating knot but once you get you get it and it’s tied on for a while. Typically I’m tying at the kitchen table with reading glasses the night before a trip. On the boat it’s a double uni or alberto knot
1086022,msp,2023-07-09 02:35:00,1336,I have moved to the three tag end knot for fluorocarbon. Not sure the actual name but it’s a great knot. Havnt had it break yet

1082762,Weeds,2022-11-05 19:35:00,782,"I would’ve given up fishing years ago if not for senkos and wacky rigging. Started catching fish in places I had fished countless times prior with little to no luck.  Got to be one of the easiest techniques to learn/use. An o ring gets you a lot more mileage out of your worm, worth the 3 seconds it takes to put one on."
1082768,Rizzo,2022-11-06 13:12:00,4754,"I used to fish our cottage lake with texas rigged (weightless) rubber worm and I caught a ton that way. Then 2 years ago I took some kid out on the lake and he fished a senko wacky. Even though I caught a good amount he outfished me significantly. Apparently an old dog can learn a new trick. I switched the next day and have never gone back. Originally I did use an o ring, but personally I don't find that they help. Without them, you lose baits as they get torn up. With them, you sometimes set a hook and just get your ring back (if the fish has only part of the bait in its mouth you can pull the ring right off the bait and its gone). I have caught pike on them as well as bass (and the occasional bite off unfortunately)"

1082801,CrowMan,2022-11-09 16:06:00,413,"For Bass, I like a 1/0 wide gap finesse hook...that's with a standard 5"" stick worm like a Senko. I like Gamakatsu hooks but all the major manufacturers have versions. Also, every plastics manufacturer has a version of the stick worm. Lately, I'm partial to MaxScent Generals. O ring or skin hooked, I haven't noticed a big difference in hooking percentage...although the O ring method tends to save on baits. I also like to fish wacky style worms on the drop shot...not only for Bass but Walleye inhale them too. Since Gary Yamamoto invented/developed the Senko in the early 90's, soft plastic stick worms fished wacky style have probably hooked more Bass than all other presentations combined. Even beginners can easily catch fish...it's what I started my kids with, and now my grandkids. And...a bubble gum pink worm hooked wacky under a float will trigger Steelhead, especially after they've seen roe (or imitations) float by all day... "

The absolute most feely type of fishing you can do is trying to get a finnesse worm through thick thick weeds like you get in the kawarthas. Its a balance of pulling, but not pulling hard enough that the weeds break off. All while trying to sense bites. Even fishing suspended crappy, or drop shotting walleye doesnt require that level of feel. Takes practice, my tournament partner is one of the most impressive people I know at this type of fishing. Its so friggin boring too but he makes it happen in deep thick weed beds like no one else that I have met."
1082814,CrowMan,2022-11-10 15:16:00,413,"Yes, I'm aware of the weed guard options. You can also "" Chicken Rig"" the Neko to make it  somewhat weedless...1st image My question was more about hook point direction. Mike Iconelli is a proponent of rigging it like the 2nd image.

1082817,CrowMan,2022-11-10 15:36:00,413,"Most definitely agree...Good equipment will put more fish in the boat. My favourite finesse rod is a MegaBass Addermine.  I've tried NRX's, St. Croix LE's, Daiwa Steez...but nothing ""communicates"" like the Addermine. There are more expensive rods, but there's just something about this blank that makes it special. I can tell if a Bluegill even breathes on my bait...nevermind bottom composition or weed type. Just an incredible stick for bottom contact finesse applications but still has plenty of backbone to haul them out. Also the handle/grip is perfect for the way I hold a rod...with most fingers in front of the reel. I'm sure others have other opinions, but I've asked my wife to bury me with this stick...lol. I take care of it with kid gloves, because unfortunately MegaBass stopped making this model. "

1082819,AKRISONER,2022-11-10 16:28:00,5558,"I rig it number 3, but I also dont throw a senko, ive thrown a trick worm on them, but truthfully my fave is the jackall neko flick. that little curve in the tail is just so nasty. I still havent found a hook I think I am totally satisfied with. Unfortunately the Gammy finesse wide gap with weed guards have really disappointed. The wire just doesnt hold up, the glue fails and the wire spins. The wire also tends to bend constantly and is maybe too light to really pull through weeds and stay shut. I think I picked up some wild JDM ones at PBPT last summer, they were a lot better but still left something to be desired. Whats funny is that I am actually in the market for a new jig and worm rod. The addermire looks super nice, to me though it might be a bit too gummy for my liking, reason being is that I kind of double the usage of my jig N worm rod to also fish 1/2 vibratos for laketrout. My specific technique for them is to cast and then rip and tickle bottom as I rip the jig, you have to feel that bottom contact in 80 fow, but not leave it too long, while also being able to smash hooksets on big lakers when they chew. Ive honestly always preffered my rods to be on the heavier action side. Even my drop shot rods, ive played with the Aaron Martens special, the NRX + DSR  the conquest DSR and I find although, ya the tips are stupid light and sensitive, they are too soft for me. Its also probably because I just sort of learned to drop shot a particular way i.e. drop swim and therefore I am accustomed to it. I baby hand my OG brown LOOMIS DSR because I doubt id ever find another rod like it. My old man has an Loomis IMX Jig N worm specifically for that ripping jigs type of fishing and its gained my attention for sure. Softish tip, but not soft like a drop shot rod, ridiculously sensitive but tons of power and backbone. it might be the direction im headed, my old GL2 Jig n worm has pardon my french, seen some schitt it was the first ""expensive"" rod I ever owned. I bought it used off of a guy with an old stradic on it for like $200. I thought Id never own a rod nicer than it at the time lol. While were on the subject of rods...Anyone anywhere should be looking at the shimano Expride line of rods, they punch soooo far above their weight its stupid. My favourite rod is actually a medium expride, I paired one up with a bantam and If I had to fish one rod for the rest of my life it would be that one, and ive got destroyers and MB reels etc and its still not even close. I love talking about the nuances of stuff, thats the part of fishing that really gets me going. I could sit for hours and talk about these little details.  "
1082820,CrowMan,2022-11-10 16:58:00,413,"""I love talking about the nuances of stuff, thats the part of fishing that really gets me going. I could sit for hours and talk about these little details."" Same here. Obviously ""the tug is the drug"", but it's the details and strategies of fishing that keep it fresh and interesting for me all these years. The Addermine is not necessarily a drop shot rod...although I do sometimes use it for that. It doesn't have that wimpy ""hinge tip"" of a NRX or GLX DSR or St Croix LE or LT. It has a surprising amount of power through the middle of the blank, but the tip just ""talks"" to me. However, it's versatile enough to fish everything from Ned Rigs to small Swimbaits. It's just too bad they stopped making it...hard to find now. It's the one rod I would never give up. Completely agree....the Expride 7ft Medium is the best bang for your buck on the market today in a finesse spinning rod. Unfortunately, I never liked the the foregrip on the first generation...I like most of my fingers in front of the reel and there just wasn't any cork. However, with the new generation, Shimano changed that...it now has the grip just the way I like it. I tried to get the new one back in the spring, but I was asleep at the switch and they sold out everywhere before I knew it. I'm on the waiting list for the next shipment, so you may see my old ones for sale.   "

1082851,Rizzo,2022-11-16 13:24:00,4754,"in those photos is that a weight stuck on the end? I generally fish them weightless, although in the past if I did fish bass later in the year I would throw a split shot 2 feet above the bait. Wasn't crazy about that set up but it got the bait a bit deeper without the wait. This weight stuck on the end (looks like a jig head with the curved part of the hook snapped off) would be a better idea."
1082854,CrowMan,2022-11-16 14:51:00,413,"Those photos are of a NEKO RIG...a variation of the Wacky.  If you read all the posts, you will see that the conversation on this thread turned in that direction."
1082876,msp,2022-11-19 03:17:00,1336,Maybe the megabass whip snake is your next rod. I heard good things about it.  	anyways ……… my complete Wacky rig set up almost exclusively these days is a 7’4 med heavy casting rod. ( GLX 893 ) I mostly throw 6 inch senkos with VMC wacky ring. 40 pound braid with 15-20 pound floro leader. I have tried every hook out there and nothing beats a 3/0 Owner Jungle wacky hook. Expensive but has the strength to hold up to a casting rod with braid. I can skip that bait so for and have way better control than with a spinning rod. 5 inch senkos I use a standard 6’6” med heavy Diawa  rod with 2500 series reel 15 pound braid. Sometime straight braid or 12 pound leader.  	one good tip is to have one rod rigged Texas and one for wacky. You can recycle you beat up Texas rigged baits as wacky baits on the other rod. Will sometimes convert the wacky rod into a Neko rod. Hook facing up

Senkos work, as does the wacky rig, just a different presentation of a plastic worm? I think the salt content of some of those soft plastics makes them prone to rearing up easily, and sticking a hook in the middle without an O ring or strap just makes it worse? Search ebay for VIENNA NASAL SPECULUM  and you can find a strap tool (Stainless steel medical grade) 3 of them for less than the plastic strap tool. "
1085808,siwash,2023-06-20 17:33:00,683,"Hey guys, back with some wacky questions!  I am going to Grundy this weekend and I want to ""deploy"" the wacky rig technique.. two questions:  1. How long should your flouro leader be that connects to your main line? (I am using braided main - I thing 30lbs?) 2. What knot are you connecting the two line with? FG knot keeps coming up in searches.  I've never used it before  Thoughts?  Thanks!"
