1086269,glen,2023-08-11 16:49:00,2641,You ever cut them open and see what they have been eating. I know not much but there could be a small fish in there.
1086270,misfish,2023-08-11 17:01:00,29133,"Never looked. I slice ,see nice red meat and say,SMOKER TIME. "
1086271,BillM,2023-08-11 17:11:00,17367,Nice man!!!  I need to get out there soon.
1086272,misfish,2023-08-11 17:31:00,29133,"Great morning went bad for my fishing buddy.  Got rammed. He is fine,but SUV and trailer and craft not.  "
1086273,Terry,2023-08-11 19:52:00,14456,Nice catch
1086276,glen,2023-08-11 23:47:00,2641,What a sad sight.  People seem to tailgate when you’re towing.
1086277,HTHM,2023-08-12 02:35:00,4082,At least its' last trip resulted in some nice fish. Sorry to see that happen.
1086278,Fisherman,2023-08-12 13:54:00,7201,"Well as long as your bud is ok, that's # 1.  Far too many idiots on the road nowadays.  Everyone needs a dashcam and one for the back."

1086287,misfish,2023-08-12 18:07:00,29133,The first of the season is da best bye. Drizzled some maple syrup on them. Sweet and salty.
1086288,CrowMan,2023-08-12 18:26:00,413,"Looks awesome...I do a half maple syrup, half whiskey drizzle as they smoke.. I thought the season has been going strong since April...lol. Good year on G Bay this summer...nice to see the numbers bounce back. The tourney had over 1500 fish entered this year."
1086290,misfish,2023-08-12 19:22:00,29133,"Well,I am a river rat guy,so wait time is different. Good early numbers swimming up already here. Giving it another go in the AM."
1086295,CrowMan,2023-08-12 20:38:00,413,They've started on Lake O too....already over 700 have passed through Corbett's. They always start early up your way. I remember back in 2012 we were getting chrome Chinnies at Montgomery's in July...that was a weird year. Best of luck tomorrow..Get 'em while they're fresh !
