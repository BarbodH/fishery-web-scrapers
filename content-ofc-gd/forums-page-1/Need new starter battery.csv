Rated fairly well."
1086268,CrowMan,2023-08-11 16:23:00,413,I'd go with an AGM type battery for the starter. Lots of advantages over a traditional lead-acid. You can buy them at CT.
1086291,captpierre,2023-08-12 19:35:00,2521,Reading about dual purpose lead acid batteries  	Marine  cranking amps 675.  Better for electronics  drain. Half the price of AGMs.
1086292,misfish,2023-08-12 20:06:00,29133,Grab the Nautilus. Never had an issue with them when I had my boats. Enjoy the rest of the season. 
1086293,CrowMan,2023-08-12 20:20:00,413,"The Nautilus AGM's are on sale at CT right now . Will last longer than lead-acid, lower self discharge rate, faster charging, more cycles, no maintenance and longer warranty.  Like a lot of things, you get what you pay for..  "
