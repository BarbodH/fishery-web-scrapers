Looking for Pickerel, Bass, Pike or Muskie. Thank you."
1085991,Britton Grant,2023-07-05 02:11:00,14,I have fished on Lake Nipissing but not at  Restoule. If you google best lakes to fish near Restoule  there are quite a few lakes that will come up. Also it doesn't look like Lake Nipissing is very far from where you will be. All seem to have what you are hoping to catch. Good luck and  have a grand and safe  time.
1085999,16 Footer,2023-07-06 10:42:00,191,There is a portage trail from Stormy lake to Bass lake that you can try. I have not been there for many years so can't say how good the fishing is today.
