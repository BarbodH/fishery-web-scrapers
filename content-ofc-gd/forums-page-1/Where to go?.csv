I can't take him north to my rustic camp because of his limited mobility. We are in Kincardine and I ask for suggestions for a 3 maybe 4 day trip where we could rent a cottage and boat that is not too far, maybe 3 or 4 hours away, species of fish are not that important just somewhere where we can get a few fish for a good fish fry, pm me if you could help me out"
