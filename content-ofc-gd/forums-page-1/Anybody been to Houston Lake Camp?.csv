One time we were coming back from a splake lake and stopped in there to check it out although we never stayed there. The camp looked quite nice. Our group preferred a more rustic camp so we never went beyond just visiting. Most of our trips were in the spring but we did take some fall trips when grouse hunters were around. We didn't hunt but the hunters seemed pleased with their success. If you decide to go and want some info on fishing in the area let me know. We targeted walleye, specks, lakers, rainbow, aurora and splake. Lots of smallmouth and pike in the area too. The picture in my avatar is the aurora I caught in that area."
