Tried looking online and could not find anything here in canada to able to source one, plus some new copper washers. Anyone here know a good place that would have a selection of them? Its really hard to take a banjo bolt in and say ""i need a new one of these, in this size and thread pattern"" because then brake fluid pours out all over my garage. What do you guys think I should do? Im all ears."

1086211,RandyLinden,2023-08-02 12:00:00,40,Sometimes the bolt is ok and new crush washers is all you need...
1086212,aplumma,2023-08-02 12:20:00,6896,remove the bolt and wrap the fitting in plastic tightly and tape it closed. this prevents the line from draining down and you can match the bolt at a local parts store. Art

Seems like theres a trailer shop in brampton that services a lot of the pro's trailers. Going to give that a stab. Might even be able to tow right there and have them pick one out for me."
