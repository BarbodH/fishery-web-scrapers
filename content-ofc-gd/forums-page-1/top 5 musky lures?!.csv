1086299,siwash,2023-08-13 02:41:00,683,"Thanks guys. I figured spinner baits would be in there. Suicks wen ti be classics. Always come up as a great lure. I am not a musky fisherman but want to give it a more serious try.  I'm one hour from Waubaushene/Severn sound and 90 min from Kawartha musky so I figure those would be great places to start!  when I was about 13 my late dad and I rented a boat at port Severn. It was bloody hot and we weren't catching much. I was losing interest pretty hard that day when all of a sudden my dad hooks into a massive musky on a cheap crappy tire plastic spinner type bait. Honestly the lure probably cost .50 and was about 3"" long at the most.  The water was very clear and not deep at all - maybe 8'. I remember I could see the bottom without a problem. Anyhow when it hit his lure it went straight to the boat and then went under the boat! Must have been at least 4 feet long. Our cheap gear had no chance. I don't even think he had the drag set properly. The line snapped quick once it went under the boat. I will never forget that experience over 35 years ago.... etched in my memory since. I'm pretty sure I had to change my underpants when I got home! 😂 I've only had one other musky follow since. That was on the burnt river a couple of years ago. thanka for the suggestions!"
1086300,siwash,2023-08-13 02:47:00,683,"Forgot to ask, what would be your favourite colour in the Suick or other lures ? Black seems to be a popular choice if I'm not mistaken?"
1086301,glen,2023-08-13 03:18:00,2641,black Go to a lake with a good population of Muskie and cast a bucktail until you catch one.
1086303,siwash,2023-08-13 14:57:00,683,Got any lake suggestions?! 😁
1086304,CrowMan,2023-08-13 15:07:00,413,Lake St. Clair for numbers.. 
1086305,Barry Willis,2023-08-13 20:39:00,180,"I know you asked for five but Ill give you one, the only one my Dad would use on Manitoulin Island and Georgian Bay over seventy years ago. K-B, It had to have been a foot long or more, thick and heavy. At one time the top of the small end was painted red but was scraped off from big Muskie and Pike teeth. I remember as a kid sneaking it out and admiring it still in the original cardboard box it came in from the factory.  It was covered with tooth marks. If you are curious as to what it looks like I found a picture of a nice shiny one without the red on Ebay. Due to my lack of computer abilities I couldn't figure out how to post it on the forum. I clicked on the not so shinny ones on Ebay at the top left of the page and it came up."

1086314,siwash,2023-08-14 14:19:00,683,"I fished it once, years ago.. recall that the big island on the north side of the lake is supposed to hold musky... we only caught smallies and panfish but it was pretty decent as I recall.   I think the we caught fish in the narrow stretch between the big island and the east shoreline. Is there a public launch in Bobcaygeon?  thanks!"
