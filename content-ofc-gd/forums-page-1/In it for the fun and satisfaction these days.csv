Always fun and gratifying when it comes together. I was up way to early to head out,so finished up a egg pattern order,then headed down to the lake for a wander and fly fish. Lots of small fish were hitting the surface all along the shore line. Put on my new foam bug and gave it a go. MAN,they eat that up like nothing. I even had to move on from a gill spot,as they were just gulping them down.  I have no idea how they  get that fly down so deep for such a small fish.   "

1085983,misfish,2023-07-03 13:42:00,29133,This morning was a blast. Lost count on how many hit and lands. Fun forsure. Then it got hot and that was it for me. Tied this little gem this morning. Was the ticket for all the fish this morning.
