1086032,Cast-Away,2023-07-09 23:19:00,790,"Hi Glen, I have used the anti slip mats from the dollar store that are used a drawer liners. The water goes through them so they are not a bouyant as carpet or a life jacket. Now I anchor off shore with an Anchor Buddy https://www.amazon.ca/Greenfield-Anchor-Buddy-Royal-AB4000-RB/dp/B0000TX8SM/ref=asc_df_B0000TX8SM/?tag=googlemobshop-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=341612205093&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2316446483614800301&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001117&hvtargid=pla-569825172371&psc=1. It is a bungee rope so anchor about 75' out form shore and back in. Then I tie my boat to shore and once I unload I let go and the boat gets pulled out into deeper water. It works really well. Here is picture of it in action. "
