327304,Jonaton,2009-04-07 01:29:00,72,I am looking at renting a cottage this sumer and one of the lakes we are looking at is Crowe. I first read that there are muskies in the lake then read that there are not since pike moved into the lake. Does anyone have any clue one way or another?  Thanks for any input Cheers Jonaton
327318,Sinker,2009-04-07 01:44:00,8692,"There used to be lots of musky in there, then pike moved in, so now if you get a musky, its a big one, and they're hard to catch. I cut my teeth fishing that lake for musky and used to get lots!  Tons of pike in there now though, they'll keep ya busy.  Sinker"
327331,Garry2Rs,2009-04-07 02:12:00,1425,I was told that there are still musky in the Crowe River above the lake.
327583,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-04-07 19:03:00,0,"Yes theres still musky in crowe but with the abundance of pike, in the shallow weedy bays you should look for different structure, also excellent chance at a hybrid, caugth one there 18 years ago that was 35inches so theve had time to grow since then, its on my list of lakes to revisit this year"
1030816,Joan,2018-07-07 18:06:00,2,I have been on the Crowe river north of the lake for 10 years and have never seen a muskie. In fact there are very few fish at all. The river has been over fished by amateurs who rent the cottages.
1030818,grimsbylander,2018-07-07 19:58:00,3016,Better late than never. The fish Jonaton released are probably trophies now.
1030821,lew,2018-07-07 20:57:00,12766,Are we to assume then that all those who actually own cottages on the lake are Pro's ?
1030822,Joan,2018-07-07 22:23:00,2,Who is Jonatan ad what did he release?
1030823,John Bacon,2018-07-08 00:54:00,3277,Not if it was the renters who caught all of the fish...
1030830,grimsbylander,2018-07-08 02:59:00,3016,No idea. Your first post was in reply to a 9 year old thread. I'm assuming he's one of those cottage renters/amateur fisherman who fished out Crowe River??  Maybe he turned pro and bought a cottage??
1030831,buick14,2018-07-08 13:38:00,741,^lol
1030850,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-08 22:53:00,2585,Funny I know people who fish it every year at there cottage and say fishing is great.  they get the odd muskie and yes pike have taking over.
1082217,Muskiemoe,2022-09-23 10:25:00,4,Yes there are still musky in the crow lake and a few in the river but you will be hard pressed to get into one unless you find a way around the pike.  	story is the ministry ( accidentally) dropped 20thousand pike into the river instead of musky. Truth is the closing of the musky hatchery just west at what was deer lake but is now cordova made a huge impact on how musky were managed and the ministry may have been responsible for the severe decline in musky populations all over Ontario by replacing with a more invasive pike population anglers have unfortunately become accustomed to this new smaller slimmy stinky version . A new musky hatchery was opened at codrington but never lasted long. Bottom line ministry is responsible for Ontarios declined musky population. Photo baby musky caught this year crow river released quickly unharmed  
1082221,Rizzo,2022-09-23 12:50:00,4754,that actually looks like a baby pike to me
1082222,BillM,2022-09-23 17:56:00,17367,That's a Tiger if I was a betting man.
1082226,John,2022-09-23 21:39:00,2956,Pretty sure it's a Tiger
1082227,Muskiemoe,2022-09-23 21:44:00,4,It’s a tiger for sure pike in these waters look very different these were the same week and much different rent
1086259,Muskiemoe,2023-08-09 11:08:00,4,There are definitely large Muskie in the crow Sorry for the bad pic it was caught off shore and was still thrashing after she was lifted to take pic she went back safely and revived quickly unharmed.
