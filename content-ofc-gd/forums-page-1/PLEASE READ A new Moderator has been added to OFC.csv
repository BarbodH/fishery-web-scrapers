We have asked a long time friend and active member of the board to help out. Misfish or Brian has stepped up to the plate and has accepted the position of Administrator to help us deal with the management and problem solving issues that pop up occasionally. We want everyone to give a warm welcome to Brian and to know he is here to help with any issues that you might have. OFC
