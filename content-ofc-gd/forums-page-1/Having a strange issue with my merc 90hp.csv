1086094,tb4me,2023-07-15 20:52:00,3295,Hello there folks long time no chat. I hope all is well. So I just chanced the shifter and throttle cables on my 90 hp merc. It's running fantastic till suddenly I lose all throttle abilities. I thought I snapped a new cable. To my surprise it's now this small bracket that the linkage rod keeps popping out of. Does anyone know what it is called and if there is something missing that I maybe accidentally broke off at some point? I tried the zip tie to keep it in position but it just auto ejects when I throttle down. Any advice? Thanks in advance!
