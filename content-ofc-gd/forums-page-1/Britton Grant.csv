1086067,Britton Grant,2023-07-12 04:17:00,14,Until covid I used to fish Sturgeon Lake every May  near Lindsay. Ontario.  The last year we were basically skunked. Tried everywhere and everything with no luck. Anyone heard how the fishing is there these days? We would like to go back if it is worth our while. Also walleye fishing on Lake Scugog was banned. Is it open now. Thanks for any help.
1086068,Big Cliff,2023-07-12 10:52:00,6899,Scugog is still closed for walleye. Sturgeon Lake is getting a lot more pressure since they closed the walleye fishing on Scugog. You can still find them but the numbers are way down from what they use to be.
