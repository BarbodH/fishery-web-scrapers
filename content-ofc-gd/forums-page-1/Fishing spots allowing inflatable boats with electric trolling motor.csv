1085869,Jon,2023-06-23 21:23:00,209,"I can recommend Island Lake and Fairy Lake. Fairy Lake is free to launch but the fish generally aren't as large. Island Lake has an entrance fee but the fishing is better and there are some pretty large fish in there. Both lakes have Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Common Carp. Island Lake also has Bluegill and most recently, Smallmouth Bass. Island Lake can get pretty weedy and rough on windy days (relatively speaking).  	Good luck! Jon"

1085871,Spiel,2023-06-23 22:10:00,9065,"I'd be checking out Lake Belwood myself. 	Launches are available at both ends of the lake. 	Walleye, Pike, Bass and Perch are in the lake."
1085878,v007,2023-06-24 12:12:00,14,"thanks Jon, i will try fairy lake as well."
1085879,v007,2023-06-24 12:14:00,14,i am very happy that you guys help a lot now i know a few free lake to launch to try my boat.
1085880,manfish,2023-06-24 13:48:00,24,"Last two years at Fairy Lake it had lots of blue algae, be careful"
1085881,CrowMan,2023-06-24 13:49:00,413,I got to agree...Fairy Lake is a sewer
1085882,CrowMan,2023-06-24 14:02:00,413,"Yes...Bass, Pike and Crappie. Clean water. Don't know how easy your boat is to carry but you can launch for free at the dam if you don't want to pay at the Conservation Area. Guelph Lake is good too. 3 ramps, only electrics allowed"
1085941,lazybum,2023-06-28 01:12:00,142,Do keep in mind that your inflatable boat with a motor will require you to have a Pleasure Craft Operators Card.  And also to have on board the necessary safety gear.
1085957,v007,2023-06-29 20:25:00,14,"I have Intex Mariner 4 inflatable boat, I will be bringing pfd for everyone on board, PCO card. any other required stuff I need to bring? when I took the exam it seem a lof to bring but I am not sure if that necessary for small inflatable boat. please advise me what usually you are required to bring other than what I missed above"

1085959,v007,2023-06-29 21:25:00,14,"thanks a lot, very usefull as it has images as well. thanks"
1085960,v007,2023-06-29 22:17:00,14,i finished my shopping for the safety kit.   
1085961,v007,2023-06-29 22:29:00,14,How do you guys bring this inflatable boat to the boat launch? any tips
1085962,v007,2023-06-30 01:24:00,14,"Hi Experience Boaters I checked the weather this weekend, Risk of a thunderstorm. meaning we should not go boating and fishing right?"
1085970,lazybum,2023-07-01 20:36:00,142,"I transport my boat fully deflated in my SUV along with motor, battery or gas tank depending on which motor I use for that trip. At the launch site, I inflate the boat with a Milwaukee M18 Blower and then top up the pressure with the supplied hand pump making the whole experience significantly less tiring at the very start.  I have installed launching wheels on my boat to allow two people to roll the boat into the water from my setup area.  Note that bolted on launching wheels will not work on your Intex boat which has no transom.  Even with wheels I can assure you that hauling 200 lbs back up a ramp at the end of the day is quite an ordeal.  To deflate I use the Blower to suck the air out making it easier to pack and transport."
1085976,v007,2023-07-02 16:23:00,14,"Thanks a lot for this steps, I also have ryobi blower which help a lot. I guess the hardest part is rolling the boat into the water without wheels on the slopy, could be slippery/ramp? I am buying the wheels now to be installed in my motor mount kit, hope this helps me. so do you place the battery inside the boat when rolling it down into the ramp? if not how do you place it on the boat when the boat already on the water? and how and when you get into the boat, is the a dock near the ramp? so we can jump into the boat and place everything we need it. sorry for detail questions since I never been launching i am worry and confused."
1085988,v007,2023-07-04 13:27:00,14,"I went to Belwood lake last weekend, it turned out there is a shallow area where i can place all my things into the boat. my first boat ride and fishing were better than expected, even though I didn't catch any fish. I didn't bring an anchor so I got drifted so many times lesson learn for myself, I need to buy an anchor."
1080020,videopete,2022-05-04 16:38:00,4,"Hi there, I just bought myself an inflatable with an electric trolling motor and am looking for quiet fishing spots within about an hours drive of Georgetown, Halton Hills. Many places I look up do not allow boats with even small trolling motors, etc. a pond or a calm lake would be ideal (not looking for Lake Ontario, etc.) If anyone has any good locations, please let me know. Thank you."

1080025,CrowMan,2022-05-04 19:22:00,413,Mountsberg fits the bill....decent fishing too https://www.conservationhalton.ca/park-details?park=mountsberg
1080037,AKRISONER,2022-05-05 03:08:00,5558,Hello to a fellow Georgetowntonian I’d personally go to island lake in orangeville  good pike bass and perch fishing
1080045,scuro2,2022-05-05 13:33:00,904,Is that a big ass inflatable or kayak? Cause where does the battery go? Basically you can fish any non private lake if you don't have a gas motor.
1080046,videopete,2022-05-05 13:46:00,4,Have you been there yourself ?   Where exactly would you launch the boat from ?  is there a location at Island Lake ?
1080047,videopete,2022-05-05 13:50:00,4,I did see Mountsberg - by the pictures it looks very shallow and weedy - have you been ?
1080048,AKRISONER,2022-05-05 13:55:00,5558,"i have been to all of the aforementioned lakes either ice fishing or in a raft to fish. Mountsberg is weedy and can get muddy but theres fish in there. Island lake is also weedy but loaded with fish. You cant not catch snot rockets there. There's even some over 30 fish in there too, i know because I have caught them. My tournament partner caught a 5+ largie there a couple of years ago as well. Island lake has a boat launch, mountsberg I do not recall there being one."
1080049,videopete,2022-05-05 14:25:00,4,"This is great information!  Thank you.   I will definitely try Island Lake first.  We are pretty new to fishing - any advice as to best bait to use/bobber no bobber ? etc.  We really don't care what type of fish we catch, we go more just for fun.  We usually bring pieces of shrimp, corn and hotdog (and live worms)"
1080050,AKRISONER,2022-05-05 15:07:00,5558,"pike opens the second saturday in May on island lake. (before venturing into any new water, always read the regs!) You will catch a bunch of perch and small panfish probably fishing with bobbers and worms. For something more exciting learn how to cast spoons to catch pike. The fish this time of year will be moving towards the warmest water closest to the deeper parts of the lake. If you are into getting serious about fishing, Id suggest just doing a load of googling about how to target whatever species you are looking to catch. Its a life long learning process that gets more and more detailed the more serious you take it. You can decide to be a worm and bobber fisherman and that suits some people just fine to go out in a boat toss out a worm and wait for a bite while relaxing, or you step your game up a bit and make things more involved, but also some would argue have more fun doing it. Or you can be stupid like me and spend all of your expendable income to stare at panoptix for 8 hours straight chasing laketrout around. I was also once a kid throwing spoons for pike from a tinner too. We all start somewhere. Let us know how you fare!"
1080051,CrowMan,2022-05-05 15:11:00,413,"Not be overlooked are the estuaries of the Lake O tributaries. The Credit, 16 Mile and Bronte all have boat launches. Depending on the time of year you can catch Silver Bass, Smallmouth, Carp, Catfish and the occasional Pike. Steelhead and Salmon in the spring and fall."
1080061,dave524,2022-05-05 17:48:00,4508,"Watch, looking some say no gasoline motors and some say no motors, electric motors maybe questionable "
1080062,misfish,2022-05-05 18:26:00,29133,"LOL, Back in the late 70,s and early 80,s,I pull over off 10 and throw small spinners and catch nice browns. That was way before your time. LMAO. BTW,Does fairy lake in Acton still hold big largies?"
1080066,CrowMan,2022-05-05 19:32:00,413,"Largemouth, Crappies and some surprisingly big Pike in Fairy Lake."
1080069,AKRISONER,2022-05-05 19:56:00,5558,"i wouldnt eat anything out of there though...I worked for the town of halton hills once upon a time, that lake is gross lol.  Also can confirm island lake allows electric only motors"
1080070,CrowMan,2022-05-05 19:59:00,413,Yeah...the septic beds of the trailer park are practically at water's edge on Fairy.
1080072,Hack_Fisherman,2022-05-06 00:28:00,720,+1 for island lake. launch in park. Guelph lake can also be good. Electrics allowed. 2 launch areas in the park. Access fee at gate.
1085841,v007,2023-06-21 18:29:00,14,do we need to pay to enter all the lakes near GTA? I saw that guelph and island lake have admission fees
1085849,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 22:39:00,5558,"Because they are all conservation areas at minimum you will typically have to pay parking during the open season There are not going to be many free public launches on small lakes trust me our bass club struggles to schedule our clubbies on lakes with free ramps, they are few and far between."
1085850,v007,2023-06-21 23:05:00,14,"That's what worries me, I just bought an inflatable boat with an electric motor, and hard to find a lake that accepts it. I don't want to go to Ontario Lake for my first try too dangerous."
1085851,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 23:10:00,5558,"I wouldn’t worry so much about free launching, go somewhere closed, save yourself the gas money and go catch some fish.  There is a free launch in Hamilton harbour. No danger in a small boat in there"
1085852,v007,2023-06-21 23:37:00,14,"I hear you but when I go I will go with the family and i am family of 5 (5 x$7=$30 ) with car $14 total is $44 per visit, if I go every weekend starting this weekend until summer end, it's really a lot of money. What is hamilton harbour? that is for lake ontario I am afraid to go to lake ontario, big lake. if I have to go to lake ontario I was thinking to go to from the beaches in missisauga there is a beach i know is friendly for swimming i can push my boat there."
1085853,v007,2023-06-21 23:49:00,14,"what do you think about lake Simcoe? only 1 hr from Brampton, can do boating, swimming, and fishing. and entry is free only parking is paid so not bad at all"
1085858,AKRISONER,2023-06-22 11:44:00,5558,"Bay front park in Hamilton is free  also I very very strongly suggest you review the capacity limit of your vessel. What you are describing, taking 5 people onto an inflatable dingy sounds extremely dangerous"
1085860,v007,2023-06-22 13:02:00,14,"Wow Amazing Akrisoner for the info that Bay Front park look good to try my motor boat, thank you so much. Regarding the capacity of the boat you are right maximum is 4 people, since this is our first try we thinking of taking a turn to enjoy the boat, then eventually only a few of us will go fishing with this boat.
