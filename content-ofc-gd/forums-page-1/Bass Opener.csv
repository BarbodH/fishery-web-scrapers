1085726,CrowMan,2023-06-15 16:20:00,413,"Bass season opens this weekend for most of southern Ontario. Curious...when you take that first cast on Saturday morning, what's going to be hanging on the end of your line ? And what are you targeting...green fish or brown fish ? Although because of a (stupid) nephew's wedding, I won't be able to get out until Monday...for me it's Smallies on a jerkbait...probably Shadow Rap Shad in Black/Silver."
1085728,Weeds,2023-06-15 18:02:00,782,Senkos. Largemouth. Not fancy but it works.
1085729,Terry,2023-06-15 18:32:00,14456,I thought most of southern Ontario is the 4th Saturday
1085731,CrowMan,2023-06-15 18:50:00,413,I'm a liitle self centered...Kawarthas and eastern Ontario open 3rd Saturday
1085733,Weeds,2023-06-15 19:01:00,782,"Zone 20 too, largemouth 3rd Saturday and smallmouth July 1st."
1085752,akaShag,2023-06-15 23:42:00,2073,"For many years (like 20 or so) I would be up before dawn to hurtle down the lake to my opening morning glory hole.Â  A Texas rigged 7 inch Berkley Power worm with a VERY light worm weight would go into a small pocket inside a shoal.Â  14 FOW on the outside, maybe 2 FOW on top.Â  Almost always, one of the biggest largemouth of the season would come topside soon thereafter.Â  On a good morning we would take five or six largemouth from an area the size of a living room.Â  For a couple magical years, it was a 10 inch Power Worm that would call in the big fish. BUT!Â  Whether it's zebra mussels, or educated bass, a Texas rigged worm has not been all that effective the last few years.Â  So I am thinking it will be a wacky worm, on the small side, on a non-weighted hook, in a natural colour.Â  About 21 hours from now, but who's counting.Â  ðŸ˜‰ Doug "
1085754,BillM,2023-06-15 23:54:00,17367,FMZ11 muskie opener.Â  I'll have a glide or (heaven forbid) a bucktail on.
1085755,Beans,2023-06-16 00:18:00,3339,A 2 1/2 ounce smoke colored salted tube under a slip float has served me well for many years for both large and small mouth bass and of course The Worlds Greatest Sportfish (Rock Bass) likes them too...
1085771,OhioFisherman,2023-06-17 19:08:00,6623,"Our season opens a lot earlier here in Ohio, and it's been almost 20 years since I could seriously fish, but a plastic lizard or worm, on a jighead or Texas rigged."
1085772,akaShag,2023-06-17 20:52:00,2073,"So we were up at 4 and in position 10 minutes before first light.Â  And............we waited........and waited.....and finally a crappie, then a largemouth came in on a ned rig.Â  Much later another largemouth on the wacky worm. It wasn't a banner day but I probably landed 15 or so. Lots of boats out, as usual....."
1085785,BillM,2023-06-19 16:20:00,17367,"What grind on Sunday on Nip.Â  Let's hope that's the only time this season I don't see a fish (Landed a 43in pike however, but it ain't no muskie lol)"
1085790,AKRISONER,2023-06-19 20:38:00,5558,"Iâ€™m late to the party that is this thread but luckily Ontario has two openers saturday morning I pulled up to our first stop with a ghost coloured vision 110 and caught a pickerel lol suddenly noticed some suspended smallies off the shoal and quickly one fell victim. Then I noticed a school of gills getting chased by something surfacing, threw the 110 and proceeded to put 4 of our 5 fish mixed bag in the boat. headed off to flip in the afternoon and culled once, missle d bomb with a pegged 3/4 tungsten. Love me some slop.  this Saturday itâ€™s most certainly going to be smallmouth. Iâ€™ll be throwing an evergreen shower blow and a Ned rig for a follow up for any missed blow ups. Once the sun gets high Iâ€™ll be grinding an evergreen cr-8 all over that shield rock.  I have a week off of work next week so later in the week Iâ€™ll go on a mission to get a tinner into a local back lake thatâ€™s loaded with giant largemouth. Our smallest bag ever out of it was 22lbs. this year Iâ€™m going to try pop my swim bait virginity throwing a deps bull shooter and see if I can crack a 6 out of the pond. Mix that with a big gabot in the pads. Swinging for the fences!"
1085901,akaShag,2023-06-26 00:08:00,2073,"It was a pretty good week on Loughborough.Â  Some days the bite was pretty tough, other days it was magical.Â  We caught good numbers, and generally good size, largemouths.Â  The smallies were smaller and not that plentiful, where we were fishing in the east end north of the marina. By far, the most productive presentation was a wacky worm, on a weightless hook, in neutral colours.Â  We had three LMB in the four pound class, but (without a scale) I do not believe we broke the magical five pound record. Doug "
1085904,AKRISONER,2023-06-26 01:58:00,5558,"We also had a what I would consider to be solid opener. most certainly could have gone better, the morning cloud cover seemed to have the smallies pretty negative. We broke down and had to finesse fish to entice bites until the sun came out, then a flurry of fish hit the boat. Â Our bag was 18+lbs, couldnâ€™t complain about that.  "
1085981,msp,2023-07-03 02:57:00,1336,A couple days after opener with Chuckenwind. Big one came off a black spook next good one was off a jig and Brads was on a black buzz bait   
1085987,AKRISONER,2023-07-04 03:10:00,5558,"Rounded out my week off well a 23+lb bag of smallies on Wednesday, a 20lb+ bag of green ones on the back pond thursday and some big by catch girls for a little seasoning      "
