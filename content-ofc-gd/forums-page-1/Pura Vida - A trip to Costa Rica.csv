We did do some excursions, wet a line and I think I now want to buy an ATV lol This was my second time to CR and I loved it - the wildlife, topography and people are second to non IMO Here is a full write up and below a few of my favorite pictures https://www.northernjacks.com/post/pura-vida Andrew    "

Pura Vida"
1079107,gordy28,2022-03-12 12:34:00,638,For sure. Â I have started using Duolingo to learn some Spanish. Â In my dreams I see myself wintering there in retirement! Â  Just need this lotto max ticket to come through! cheers Andrew

Your enthusiasm for the place shines through your words! Thanks for sharing your experience, and I can't wait to read your full write-up and see those fantastic pictures. It might just convince me to plan my own Costa Rica adventure soon! By the way, you can check out Costa Rica Focus for more inspiration and tips.

1086161,Rizzo,2023-07-26 01:32:00,4754,Great report. We have considered CR a couple of times but it has always come up runner up to a different spot. This past Feb we went to Cuba and our snorkelling tour allowed me to troll with a rod they had hooked up as well. I was less fortunate...had one rip but it didn't hook up
