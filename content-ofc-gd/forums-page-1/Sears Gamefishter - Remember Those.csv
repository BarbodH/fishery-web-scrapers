However I did have a Sears Gamefisher Electric motor, 25 speed (rheostat type dial) that served me well for many, many years before giving it away."
1085967,Weeds,2023-06-30 16:33:00,782,"I too had one of these, a 1.2hp that never worked particularly reliably. Preferred the driveway to any waterbody. Â A shame cause it was so light. They were also sold as Tanaka . I remember parts being difficult to source and that was 10 plus years ago. I think I just sold mine last year."
