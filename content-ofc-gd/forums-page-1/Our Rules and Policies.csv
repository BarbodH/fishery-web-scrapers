He is in charge of getting the site to talk to all of our members and fixing what is broken. If you feel that it is something he can help with please send him a note using the contact us at the bottom of the page near the center. He will get back to you as quick as he can but remember he has a full time job first and is donating his time and efforts to make the site better.  If you use this service your reply will come to the email account you have on file.  Thanks   Art

If you are found to have more than one account than all accounts associated will be flag as a spammer and banned from the board. This is a big NO NO Art
