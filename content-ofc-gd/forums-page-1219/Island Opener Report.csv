69236,theRJ,2007-05-08 22:02:00,55,"Well I finally did it! I caught me some Islands Pike. I went out early on the opener and began over on Ward's. I didn't see a single fish until I reached the Yacht Club. There were several fish lounging in the shallow water, they were prolly 25-35 inches (smallest and biggest with a couple in between) but they weren't interested. I spent a good half hour and marinated a half dozen lures on the big one but it wasn't playing.  I moved down the shore and set up again. I was using a big perch coloured Xrap and was just slowly bringing it along when I saw a big flash. I casted again and used a much more aggresive retrieve the fish followed but short struck it again. After this happened again I tried something different, I brought it in hard and stopped it. The pike hit again but missed so I pulled up the lure to cast again, not knowing the pike was coming back for another go. It followed the lure out of the water and nearly made me fall in. Luckily the 5th strike was the charm. I set the hook and she dove for the bottom a few seconds later, nothing. Either the fish or a friendly zebra mussel had sheared off my 45lb flouro leader! Frustrated, I moved on down the shore.  Now on Centre Island I was casting out and felt the pull, I set the hook and it was game on! Moments later I brought to shore my first TO Islands pike. I estimate her at about 28 inches and nice and healthy. After a quick struggle to unhook it I whipped out my camera and prepared for the photo...but alas I was foiled by my own early rising. I had left my battery plugged into the wall!!!! Then I remembered my cellhone has a built in camera!!!! I lined up the shot and...got a not enough space warning. I decided then that it was more important to release my fish then to get proof. I torpedoed the pike and she swam away strong ( gave me a shower from 5 feet away)  Then I moved down shore and ran into Shuan and Patrick (Tbay and PatrickG) before the unfortunate hooking accident. We moved back down shore and I managed to get into another. It took the bait right near the end of the cast and the pike absolutly inhaled my bait. Unfortunately it wasn't hooked and had just grabbed on to my leader. It opened its mouth and took off. Another big fish gone, but at least I got my lure back!  I decided then to work my way back to Ward's and took a stab at the big one that still had my lure. A few casts in, fish on. I prepared for my call of victory but it was not my lure thief, only a little scrapper of about 24 inches. So if anyone catches a pike with a perch xrap and the remainder of a leader in its mouth lemme know please! I went back to the lazy Beach Bum fish but they were still not ready to play so I headed back to the Ferry and home.  Sorry about the lack of pictures but believe me I hate it too.  RJ  PS Yes I am back from a long, hard year of school! and I look forward to a much more fish filled summer this year!  And for those who dont know me my name is Rob Johnson (hence theRJ) and I am a 3rd year civil Engineering student at Ryerson University. I am currently working for the summer at Best Buy and a large consulting firm in the Transportation department. I may end up working there for a 16 month internship if things pan out like I hope. I love fishing amd some other stuff but its not important. I dont own a boat, I own a float tube and I enjoy fishing for Bass, Pike, Panfish, Walleye/Pickeral (is that still an issue?) and anything else that'll bite my line. Oh and next time I'll remember my battery so i can put my new camera to good use, instead of lugging it around pointlessly all day!"

69379,theRJ,2007-05-09 02:07:00,55,Thanks GCD glad to have the time to be back! How is the finger doin Tbay? Hope it gets better quick.
69408,mikeymikey,2007-05-09 04:07:00,376,"I noticed that everyone said, work the lure slowly. Why is that? Water too cold? Not warm enough? What will make pike feed more aggressively ?  Will they bite top water bait?   ----------------- Where can I buy a quality floruo leader cheap?  (maybe i should buy from FHR? if I happen to run into him?)"
69409,mikeymikey,2007-05-09 04:10:00,376,and how come i don't hear anyone talk about fish toward the hanlan side of water?
