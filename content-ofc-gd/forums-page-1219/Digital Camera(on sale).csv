69820,Mike the Pike,2007-05-10 02:17:00,3421,"  Kevin I agree its not a Canon which I also have but for some people on this board students,folks on a tight budget or maybe just a spare compact camera its a good bang for the buck.My daughters M425HP is no harder on batteries than my Canon A-530.We need as many members as possible with Digital cameras so they can send us pics which we truly love on the OFC."
