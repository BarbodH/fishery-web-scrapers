69602,ccmtcanada,2007-05-09 17:47:00,7971,"LOL Urbanangler....I know the feeling.  Most nights when bly and I head out for walleye, we are skunked.  It's quite frustrating!!!  After we each got on in mid October last year, we went out probably 4 to 5 nights a week...and went 5 weeks without so much as a nibble.  Then it took off...catching one after the other....Dont worry, your time is coming...and my prediction is some monster pike is in your future!"
69618,Bitsmith2k,2007-05-09 18:30:00,396,"lol.. i thought the same thing... then my buddy crushes them last weekend, i would have been skeptical if i hadn't witnessed it first hand.. if i dont break my T.O pike cherry this saturday, i might give up. ."
69665,theRJ,2007-05-09 20:37:00,55,Took me at least 20 trips before I caught any. If you put in the time you will be rewarded. It costs me 6 bucks for the ferry and another 6-10 for parking!  RJ

69851,Rizzo,2007-05-10 03:03:00,4754,"Northern Pike...the new fish of 10,000 casts  If something isn't working, try something else.  Don't just keep that xrap on there.  Try slow, try fast, try shallow, try deep, go with something that looks ridiculous like a red devil spoon that casts a mile and can be fished at any depth and virtually any speed, bounce a jig off bottom...eventually you'll find the meal ticket"
69856,urbanangler1990,2007-05-10 03:15:00,933,"ok thnx guys for boost, im eager to get back at it now, sooon"
69862,007,2007-05-10 03:23:00,537,"Don't worry Urbanangler, you'll get them soon.  Same thing happened to me last night down there - no pike caught, though I did hook one but lost it.  Better luck next time."
