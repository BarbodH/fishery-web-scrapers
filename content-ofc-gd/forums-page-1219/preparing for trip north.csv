I was wondering if any of you have fished either of these lakes before and have any recommendations. Also how are the black flies this year, we will be arriving the Sunday of the long weekend and staying until Friday. I know this lake has a good population of pike and walleye, any thing I should make sure I have in the tackle box."

69563,irishfield,2007-05-09 15:27:00,26272,Black flies always come out at Noon on the friday of the May 24 weekend. They know fresh meat is coming to town.
69564,FinS,2007-05-09 15:29:00,463,dont know much on the lake but good luck my parents live up that way and the mosquitoes are starting up bring a bug coat or hat it helps alot
69570,Fishnfiend,2007-05-09 15:58:00,357,"Bring winterwear.  I was up that way last year on the long weekend and it snowed - LOTS! ON the upside, there weren't many bugs.  I am making the trip a week later this year in hopes of no snow and less people. Any good lake trout lakes between sudbury and timmins that one can launch a boat at?  Are you staying indoors or camping? Be mindful of the bears and where you store your food.  Bug hat/jacket is a must as well as repellent with a high deet content."
69577,irishfield,2007-05-09 16:06:00,26272,Yep...3 inches of snow on our roof when we got up on the Sunday morning....that better not happen again!...but go prepared.
