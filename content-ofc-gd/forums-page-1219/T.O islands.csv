69208,bassmaster4,2007-05-08 20:08:00,801,My dad and I want to go to Centre island for pike in a couple of weeks. How do you get to the ferry from Hamilton? Is it right in front of the CN Tower? How long of a ride on the ferry is it? When does the first ferry leave saturday the 19th to Centre island in the morning? Lastly what is the hot bait or lure the pike go for there?  Thanks

69214,bassmaster4,2007-05-08 20:22:00,801,how about x-raps or mepps?

69235,bassmaster4,2007-05-08 22:01:00,801,one more question do i need to buy tickets or do i pay as im about to get on the boat?
69241,dsn,2007-05-08 22:12:00,1018,  Theres a ticket booth just before you enter the ferry. You must purchase the ticket beforehand. Adults $6.00 for round trip
69271,silveradosheriff,2007-05-08 23:22:00,1025,Stupid Question - does anyone launch nearby and fish from their boat?
69274,JEREMY,2007-05-08 23:28:00,300,I think you need a special lisence if you fish the islands from a boat.
69312,silveradosheriff,2007-05-09 00:29:00,1025,OK - I'm searching for those details....
69350,lazybum,2007-05-09 01:27:00,142,The special license they are referring to must be the Harbour License that is required for boats.
69368,silveradosheriff,2007-05-09 01:55:00,1025,Thanks!
69378,mepps,2007-05-09 02:06:00,1301,You can launch at Humber bay - I have had better luck shore fishing then boat fishing though!  The islands are a shore fishermans dream!  The ferry costs  $6
69451,silveradosheriff,2007-05-09 10:47:00,1025,"Thanks Mepps - so if you launch at Humber Bay, is the special license still required?"
69459,ricoboxing,2007-05-09 11:23:00,398,"with the weather heating up though, in a couple of weeks it may be choked with weeds, and the pike may have moved to deeper waters. So bring some corn and worms too so if there are no pike, then you can fish for some carp."
69460,mepps,2007-05-09 11:27:00,1301,"Yup, any vessel entering Toronto harbour will need the harbour lisence, even if you launch 100miles away."
