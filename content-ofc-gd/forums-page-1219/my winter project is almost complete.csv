70117,easton13th,2007-05-10 18:05:00,371,That looks like a lot of entertainment for the value.  Easton
70118,ccmtcanada,2007-05-10 18:07:00,7971,"Very cool...gonna put some heavy duty tires on it and use it to tow all your ice fishin gear next winter?  Great thing about it is at the end of the day, you could just put in the trunk of a car...haha.  Nice work!!!!!"
70119,Zib,2007-05-10 18:08:00,369,With the high gas prices that toy will make a nice daily comuter.
70128,Terry,2007-05-10 18:25:00,14456,I had one of them..years ago  they are very unstable..I would be real careful letting anyone under 16 ride it.. without training wheels and a governor on the gas  but they are fun
70139,irishfield,2007-05-10 18:49:00,26272,Have fun...and like Terry says.....at least they're close to the ground so it's not as far to fall.
