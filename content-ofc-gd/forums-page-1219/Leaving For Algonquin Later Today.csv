69440,solopaddler,2007-05-09 09:08:00,8605,"Mondays and Tuesdays are always tough for me. My shifts at the weather office run from 2pm Monday, 'till 6am Tuesday, then 2pm Tuesday 'till 6am Wednesday with basically no sleep from Sun night to Wed night.(my choice btw) Anyhow, as I sit here in my office with my last shift winding down trying to clear my head and pry my eyes open with nuclear strength java  , I'm filled with nervous anticipation. We leave later today at 1pm for our first film shoot in Algonquin Park. Hope things go well, there's a lot of people counting on me.  Report to follow next week  cheers,  Mike"

69468,Basskicker,2007-05-09 11:51:00,421,Hey Mike....good luck with the filming....I'm sure you'll do fine!! Just go up there and do what you normally do....remember....just because your filming it....doesn't mean that you have to change things...be yourself and keep it natural and raw.  Pretend that the camera's are not even there.  Cheers  Jason

69588,Bernie,2007-05-09 16:54:00,3190,Hi Solopaddler. You may want to see if the fire restrictions are on for Algonquin. Just in case you may catch a fish and want to cook them up.
