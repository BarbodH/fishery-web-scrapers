I only managed to land a really young one (maybe 3-4'') but did see a few big ones. Unfortunately, they were too easily spooked with the crystal clear water conditions. Maybe another day.  I'm thinking of going back out on Friday but I was wondering if anyone from the area has had any success recently. Any tips on a river or location that still has fish in it would really be appreciated. Feel free to PM me.  Thanks and good luck to anyone else who's still chasing late season bows."
