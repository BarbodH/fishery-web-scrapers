68269,Doop,2007-05-06 13:08:00,22,"Hello guys, I am trying to find the name of a lake for a northern pike ice fishing trip.  I know the lake is near Atikokan, Ontario.  I also know the lake is deep and clear, with big shallow bays connected to the main lake basin.  I know there are lake trout and northern pike but not sure of other species.  Can anyone help?"

68274,danc,2007-05-06 13:17:00,4677,Could it be Clearwater Lake?
68276,Doop,2007-05-06 13:18:00,22,I really wish I had more info....I think it's primarily known as a lake trout lake. From looking at a map I was thinking it was Marmion Lake....would that be right?  I'm basically looking for a lake that I can do some tip up fishing for trophy northerns.....is there a better choice that anyone may know of?

68282,Doop,2007-05-06 13:37:00,22,I don't even have that.....sorry.  I just looked on mapquest and the only big lake I see near Atikokan is Marmion Lake.  I apologize for being so vague....I wish I had more information.
68369,tjsa,2007-05-06 19:02:00,1578,Could it be White Otter Lake??
68971,Doop,2007-05-08 01:37:00,22,I think it might be Clearwater West.  Has anyone fished this lake?  I think it's about 30 minutes or so to the northwest of Antikokan.
69088,dustink,2007-05-08 13:30:00,526,"There's a lodge on Clearwater (http://www.brownsclearwaterlodge.com/)  I know it's deep & clear and has lakers.  White Otter Lake also has lakers....White Otter is a beautiful lake.  We vacationed up there last summer on Turtle Lake, and spent a day with a tour guide visiting WOL, the castle, and looking at pictographs.  Just some amazing country up there....  Best of luck... dk"
