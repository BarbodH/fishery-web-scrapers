69821,tjsa,2007-05-10 02:18:00,1578,"As stated above, she passed away last night at our hospital, went in there because of stomach problems. She had multiple sclerosis, and was in a wheelchair for quite some time. Talked to my cousin tonight(her son) and for some reason, they have ordered an autopsy to be done, so the funeral will not be until saturday at best. So, I will be distracted waiting for more info.  I might show up here, I might not.  Don't make too big of a deal about this please, its life, it happens. You do not have to respond to this post with condolences. I am just letting everyone know that I might not be frequenting this board for a couple of days.  Take care everyone.  Tom"
