Both places offer fantastic fishing, great scenery and great camping.  This year we want to go again but want to try a new place.  Driving 10 hours north of barrie is ok for us.  looking for great fishing, pike walleye, etc.  Can anyone suggest a prov park with a lake and why you suggest that place?  we know we have to book soon  thanks"

69656,irishfield,2007-05-09 20:18:00,26272,"Fushimi PPark in Hearst. Middle of BFNwhere. Sand beach for the kids if you have them. Launch, easy to navigate lake with weedy bays hidden in back corners to fish for pike. Lots of structure to fish for pics. If lucky moose and the odd bear to view. Be sure you have a tight fitting boat cover though. 7 miles of the dustiest road you've ever seen to get in off #11.    "
