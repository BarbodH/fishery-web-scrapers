Luckily no nerves hit or anything like that, have to watch the wound for infection so i figured I'd skip fishing today - pretty sure slimy pike and toronto harbour water isn't exactly what I need covering it .  Thanks for the kind words everyone and be careful out there (I actually have a glove and it was in my bag but my bag wasn't near the fish and hey - I never needed the glove before right?)"
68449,fishindevil,2007-05-07 00:15:00,6254,"Well that sucks man..  ..been there done that....i needed plastic surgery,well at least you are ok,andtoo bad your day of fishing was ruined,better luck next time...cheers"
68520,BillyBarilko,2007-05-07 02:18:00,28,"I remember 20 years ago attempting to net a nice rainbow for a gentleman at the Burlington lift bridge pier in the spring, and the hook pop'ing out of the fish's mouth, flying by my face (no glasses) and landing in the upper lip of the gentleman.  Things I learned from this: Never land a fish like that unprotected, and 2nd, wear eye gear at all times.  You can't cover 100% of yourself, as this case points out, but if one thing is taken from it, protect the most important parts"
68608,dustink,2007-05-07 12:45:00,526,Ouch......  dk
68660,Joey,2007-05-07 14:52:00,9122,"Been there, done that. OUCH!!!  Glad you got it tended to and the tetanis shot.  When I got the hook in my hand at Lakair last year, I figured I had my tetanis shot within the 10 year time frame.  When I got back I went to the doc's for something else and asked him when the last time I had a tetanis shot, and it was Over 10 years, so I had to get one.  Good thing nothing happened while camping, although I'm sure Paul would have been somewhat happy if I got lockjaw  Joey"
68663,ccmtcanada,2007-05-07 14:58:00,7971,"OUCH!!! Your topic title mentions Lesson Learned.  I guess we all know what the lesson is...  NEVER FISH WITH PATRICKG!!!!  Of course I'm only joking...I'd like to meet up with both of you one day.  Hope it heals up fast!!  Always enjoy your reports...hopefully next time if wont end with ""On the way to the hospital...."""
68684,tbayboy,2007-05-07 15:31:00,1497,"Haha Cliff thats classic but I think its the opposite: I've been out with Patrick 3 times - 1st time I got my PB pike and he got skunked (on the islands just before end of season back in march), then 2 weeks ago we headed down the Niagara way and we wasted an hour because I locked my keys in the car (with the gear inside) then this week I go and cut our day short by impaling myself - I'm beginning to think I'm cursed  Actually I picked up some new trebles and replacement x-rap for Patrick (if you read Patrick this don't buy one!)  - least I could do for his help.  Next week it'll be revenge time!"
68693,Raf,2007-05-07 15:44:00,3495,"small pike are the ones that get ya for sure.  grab them behind the head and tehy usually freeze up on you.  Never a bad idea to carry hook cutters with you.  i dont think gloves are a good idea.  first, you lose a lot of ""feel"" for what you are doing when working away.  2nd, what happens when the hook goes through the glove with fish attached?  you're now attached to the fish via a glove.  some of these gloves are ""cut-proof"" yet the hooks will still go through them.  What then?"
68781,Dutch,2007-05-07 19:54:00,831,"Ouch, glad to hear you're okay now."
69507,JerseyDog,2007-05-09 13:15:00,190,Go barbless and you can flip the hooks out in seconds. Once you relealize you can still land fish w/o barbs and you can release them lightening quick no matter how badly they are hooked and you'll never want to go back.  I did it and I LOVE it.
69531,Hooked,2007-05-09 14:13:00,891,OUCH!  I know how ya feel.
69636,Ron,2007-05-09 19:25:00,1683,"Well isn't that the strangest thing! I know exactly where you were. Do you recall seeing a Green Lund with a couple of guys in it by the grand stand? I was wondering what the guy was doing in the water! LOL  I thought he was concerned about a fish he just released because I recall seeing the guy with a fish on then shortly after he was in the water. We did great that day by boat. This was my first time on that body of water, not exactly my coice of waters but never the less still had a great time. Between the 2 of us we boated 30 + for the day. I can garauntee we lost just as many! Sure is a bit of a haul to get there though. With The DVP being closed and avoiding traffic, it was just over an 8 mile run."
69651,tbayboy,2007-05-09 20:09:00,1497,"Yeah I remember you guys Ron - there were a few boating anglers out last weekend and it sure sounds like it paid off (not that I'm jealous - bastages - nope, not at all   ) but I can just imagine the pain it was getting the boat down there with no DVP (was enough trouble just getting my car down there and back up)."
69800,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-10 01:53:00,0,great report. Though that sucks about the hooks. I had the exact same thing happen to me and it was also a puny pike.  You may want to consider getting a tetnis(sp?) shot.  Oh and they say bad luck comes in threes. So the worst is over. Get out there and catch some fish!!!
68225,Greencoachdog,2007-05-06 02:04:00,8163,"  First you beat it to a bloody pulp with a baseball bat (or hockey stick), then gingerly remove the hook!"
68229,tbayboy,2007-05-06 02:13:00,1497,"Haha, yeah that would work (and growing up thats the way the little snot rockets were treated).  The larger ones like in my profile pic are fine (under the gills) or for a bit smaller you can squeeze down behind the eyes (on the gills kinda - look at the last pick in patricks signature) assuming you can put your hand around its neck; I wouldn't suggest lipping them thought .  This one was just a couple pounds and made us 'lazy' when handling it and frankly we were both trying to get the hooks out at the same time (it was hooked under the mouth in a weird and ugly way) so 4 hands, extra hooks and a small fish coupled with their slime factor and the the back treble hanging loose  is what got me - had nothing to do with how to hold them in this case, just my own stupidity.  Just one of those things but does make me wonder if there's a market for an easy to use 'wrapper' you could drop on the exposed trebles to cover them while you worked on the embeded one.  Ah well, live and learn - maybe I should try crappies next - anyone got any ideas on shore sports for 'em?"
68231,motv8tr,2007-05-06 02:20:00,2587,"Dang, that's one heck of a day you had there...gotta say I'm impressed with your typing ability though with a bumb finger and all.  Hope it heals up ok.  Maureen"
68234,huntervasili,2007-05-06 02:25:00,1604,"Well nice fish and glad to hear you got your finger all fixed up... could of course have been much worse so you've gotta be thankful for that... maybe the hook in your face, or even two of the points stuck in yea... heal up fast and get some more of them buggers..."
68307,snag,2007-05-06 15:07:00,1932,"Yowza!  Had the same thing happen to me. Unfortunately it's been over 6 months and my finger has not healed (the hook went into my knucle) I think you'll be good real soon.  I've breifly met Patrick, very nice man. Good that he was there to help.  Get well soon!"
68311,Jigger,2007-05-06 15:14:00,1237,"The small ones always seem to be a lot feistier than the big ones. Hard to hang on to if the fish isn't much bigger than the lure. That looks like a sketchy spot to get hooked, OUCH! Hope you recover and get out there soon!"
68339,majorlifts,2007-05-06 16:42:00,171,"I had an experience with a muskie that left me with a feeling of great respect for this fish and pike. I caught a muskie, and forever have used a glove till one fine day I thought, hey im too good at this game to wear protective gear. Tisk tisk tisk, the grave mistake killed my afternoon of amazing muskie action in the hospital getting 4 stitches in my thumb.  Great care and respect is required when handling fish this size. No doubt about er."
68352,bassmaster4,2007-05-06 17:30:00,801,just by seeing that i think im gonna get some gloves for handilng fish
