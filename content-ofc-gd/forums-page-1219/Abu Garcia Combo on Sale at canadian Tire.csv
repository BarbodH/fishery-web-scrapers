70039,Hooked,2007-05-10 15:24:00,891,"They seem to have this sale on for the last 3 years.  I picked one up last year, decent little combo.  My reel unfortunately has some issues though, have to keep checking my drag cuz it losens on its own.  Other than that, its a great deal for $30."
70108,Dutch,2007-05-10 17:29:00,831,For $30 bucks great deal.  I bought one LY and one this year.  The only issue I see after using this year's model so far is the reel seat doesn't hold the reel 100% tight.  Kind of moves back-an-forth a bit if you pull on it.  The only reason I probably notice it is becuase I felt it move slightly once.  Not a big deal though.
