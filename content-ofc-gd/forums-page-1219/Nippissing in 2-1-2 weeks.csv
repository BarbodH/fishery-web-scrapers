Tire/ w-mart etc. Lefebvres used to have tackle, but I was there last summer and it looked like they had gone more towards outdoor gear and clothing.  As for Calender and the smaller places around the south east area of the lake you can find the typical gas/bait/groceries stores. Not the best selection but it dosn't make business sense to carry walls and walls of stock.  I try to cover all isuses before leaving and either make due or head into North Bay if I can't.   Rob"

Well, everyone did well, me, SKUNK.  Jig and a worm, that's it!!  Sherriff"
