69514,fatherof3,2007-05-09 13:37:00,1769,"just wanted to say hi and introduce myself. I have been checking out this site for awhile and decided to register. I am engaged and have three children age 14,13 and 6. I fished a lot and then for years I didn't have time to. I have started up again when time allows. I wish I could get out more considering all the places close to Paris for fishing. The fishing I like to do is for salmon and trout, lake or river. I am trying to get my kids into it as well. So far I have taken them pier fishing for salmon and river fishing. I have not posted or joined till now as I really have not had anything to post. From reading others posts I realize there are a lot of great people on this site and hopefully I can get out and post some of my own trips this year. I will be getting the kids out as much as possible for anything so should have some reports. If I can help anyone out I will. I fish catch and release only as keeping fish for me would be a waste. anyway, just wanted to say hi and hope my intro was good. I look forward to becoming a part of this community."

I have a 5 and 15 year old, and we love to get out there....even if it's just for panfish.  It's all about the experiences and memories.  Looking foward to your reports...I'm sure you'll fit right in!"

We'd love to see a great family outing.  That can be some great quality time with the kids.  My neighbor likes to fish and had his two young grand-daughters out at a local pond yesterday and came back with some HUGE perch.  The kids had a blast.  Welcome aboard and glad you registered."
