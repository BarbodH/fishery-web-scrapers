69195,misfish,2007-05-08 19:24:00,29133,What else ya got to do during the cold winter months.LOL  Look at those G3 boats.
69243,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-08 22:15:00,1183,Enjoy your holidays...I will miss reading your comical replies to others.  Building planes - very impressive - I prefer the big ones myself
69247,irishfield,2007-05-08 22:28:00,26272,"Thanks CHen,   Na...the little ones are safer! The force of the impact goes up by the square of the velocity!"
69275,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-08 23:28:00,1183,"  Uh huh...I failed grade 10 physics, but I can sure weld - truly I can."
69333,Landlocked,2007-05-09 01:05:00,171,Yur killin' me here Wayne
69335,irishfield,2007-05-09 01:09:00,26272,LOL Andy....
69356,Dano,2007-05-09 01:38:00,719," Yea man, I like the sound of that Wayne!"
69474,Smokey,2007-05-09 12:01:00,1278,Good Luck Wayne and enjoy the new boat and the time off.
68935,irishfield,2007-05-08 00:28:00,26272,...since I was such a good little boy    I can have until October off if I take her with me! WOHOOOOOOO It's    time!!!      Couple of customers float planes to get flown out of here thru the week and then off to the lake on Monday!  Can't wait to blast around the lake in my new toy.
68936,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-08 00:30:00,2585,right on!  have a great spring and summer up north!  cheers!
68939,Terry,2007-05-08 00:39:00,14456,have you ever counted how many rivets in one of those
68940,irishfield,2007-05-08 00:39:00,26272,Now we just have to get it to Seattle Washington somehow Paul...anyone going that way? I don't wanna build a crate.
68942,Dondorfish,2007-05-08 00:40:00,1000,Love the pictures of the planes Wayne! Do you test fly them yourself or do you do the shells only and them ship them out? How many hours do you put into each one?  Don
68943,irishfield,2007-05-08 00:40:00,26272," Complete airplane of this type...18,500. This fuselage hull I think there's about 700 rivets left in the box that was 10,000  A set of floats like I did last winter 13,200 give or take a hundred or two."
68949,Joey,2007-05-08 00:44:00,9122,What a good boy  Although I did see you on here earlier    but I'll never tell  Joey
68951,irishfield,2007-05-08 00:46:00,26272," All depends what the customer wants Don. This guy just wanted a jump start to get him done. He has his wings and tail feathers built and I did the bare fuselage hull. He can now finish the interior floor, install the controls and engine and go flying.  Others I have completely finished (about 1000 hours of work) and in that case yes I do the test flights. I will only test fly stuff I've installed the engine in.  Many others come in as wrecks and I rip them apart and make them better than new again."
68952,irishfield,2007-05-08 00:46:00,26272, Musta been my lunch break.....
68958,Jacques,2007-05-08 01:14:00,97,"Man, that is a cool job you got there"

68964,irishfield,2007-05-08 01:27:00,26272, A few of the ones I've rebuilt were used that way Jack!
68968,motv8tr,2007-05-08 01:35:00,2587,"And here I was all set to break the news that it wasn't finished yet, and ask what fumes you've been inhailing  Have a great time Wayne, see ya at Lakair.  Maureen"
68979,John,2007-05-08 02:05:00,2956,"Hey Wayne,  Have a great summer. Do you have internet access up there?  John"
68980,irishfield,2007-05-08 02:08:00,26272, Nope..if I did I'd never get the place renovated!!  I'll be back on the 25th till about June 8th. Then gone for the summer/fall with the odd trip home to post my adventures!
68982,John,2007-05-08 02:12:00,2956," OK then, see you at Lakair.  John"
68986,irishfield,2007-05-08 02:15:00,26272,Sure will... June 18th to 25th .. me and the Boss !
69021,GbayGiant,2007-05-08 03:32:00,1780,"That's amazing work Wayne, have fun fishing, hope you nail some pigs. (Not that kind)"

69073,Dano,2007-05-08 12:28:00,719,"Man Wayne, time flies huh? Glad to see you got her done, enjoy your time at the cottage and I look forward to seeing you again at Lakair, then Temagami in July/August. I'm counting on you to let me know where I can nail some of those elusive Temagami walleye.......so actually, your work hasnt even started yet!"
69103,OhioFisherman,2007-05-08 14:19:00,6623,That`s a lot of beer cans! Looks pretty for a plane!
69145,dustink,2007-05-08 16:35:00,526,"Congrats, Wayne!  Enjoy your summer!!  dk"
69162,irishfield,2007-05-08 17:48:00,26272," Definitely Lakair Dan and you know where the first stop is that you're making, in that houseboat, in July! You could also call in your position reports and I'll come find you during the week as well !   It's pretty close Paul...most of the skins are only .020"" and bulkheads are only .025"". Amazing what you can do for strength with the right shape.  ..and Thanks Dustin...you heading for Fushimi again?"
69163,misfish,2007-05-08 17:56:00,29133,"I still think you got to try and build me a boat. Something that will withstand the power of a 250 yammy and slick as a bass boat.  What ya think bud,can we do it  Don t need to answer right away,enjoy your vacation and take sometime to think about it.  Safe summer to you and the family Wayne."
69183,kennyman,2007-05-08 18:55:00,737,Wow Wayne!! You are an artist sir.
