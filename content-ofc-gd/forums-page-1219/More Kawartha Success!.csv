Went out for two hours and pulled in about 150 fish, kept about 35-40.  One stretch I pulled in 12 fish on 12 casts and 7 of those were keepers!  The one I am holding in this pic is 12.5 inches, the biggest of the night!  Quite the slab.  The bucket holds the rest of our catch,    Here is about 1/4 of our haul after a lot of cleaning!  Dinner is going to be great tomorrow night!  We are also going over to Dale's place on Saturday for a Crappie fry followed by a few friendly games of poker.  Can't wait - crappie, then poker - what can be better?  "
