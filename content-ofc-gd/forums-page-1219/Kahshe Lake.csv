69790,leighfns,2007-05-10 01:36:00,103,This weekend I am camping at 6 mile lake pp and on sunday I wanted to make a trip to Kahshe lake.  I was wondering if there is a public boat launch? and if anyone has a map of this lake as I here rocks etc.. are not marked very well.  If anyone has info on this lake that would be great...

If you head straight out from the launch in a few hundred metres you'll be running into trouble.  If you hang a left heading away from the launch the boating is safer.  Last time I fished there was Sept 11, 2001 so what I've told you here are general, not specific memories."
