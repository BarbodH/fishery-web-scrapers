69497,Smitty1,2007-05-09 12:53:00,29,Hi Guys  My computer has recently crashed - I lost everything - so I purchased a new computer - I had map create 6.3 on my old computer - so I was wondering if I can load this on too my new computer or is it only able to load once? Also regarding the card registration - what happens with that? I was at 4 cards registered.  Any help you can give me with this would be appreciated.  Thanks Smitty
