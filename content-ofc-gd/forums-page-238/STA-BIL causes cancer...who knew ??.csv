I was reading the label and came across a message that states  ""WARNING....this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer""  I've got a couple other bottles of STA-BIL in the garage that don't have that warning.  Just thought others may find it interesting."

853020,irishfield,2014-05-10 17:54:00,26272,Everything sold to California causes defects..... have you ever seen what happens to women when they move to rodeo drive...
853026,lew,2014-05-10 18:26:00,12766,"That's a crazy long list Paul, perhaps I'll remove California from those places I may like to visit someday LOL"
853031,BowSlayer101,2014-05-10 18:40:00,296,almost all my sinker packs and a lot of my lure packages say that lol.
853033,kickingfrog,2014-05-10 18:45:00,8333,Lots of fishing rods to now have that same warning. Just one more thing to shake your head at from Cali.
853067,Canuck2fan,2014-05-10 21:20:00,1444,Does the sillycon need to have warnings on it when it gets installed on Rodeo drive? LOL
853068,SirCranksalot,2014-05-10 22:06:00,3291,"Doctors have just discovered that saliva causes cancer, but only if swallowed in small quantities over a long period."

853076,lew,2014-05-10 22:38:00,12766,That's interesting Paul how the western half of the States seems to have a much lesser incidence of cancers.
853079,npt1,2014-05-10 23:00:00,220,"Well,  apparently everything has side effects,  I have heard that wedding cake can ruin your sex life. just my 2 cents worth."

853107,Sinker,2014-05-11 02:26:00,8692,The list of non cancer causing agents is much shorter.....wait a minute....there isnt one!  S.
