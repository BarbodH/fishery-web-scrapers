Throw in the odd 3lbs bass and game on you got yourself a great outing lol"
852588,registerfly,2014-05-08 02:41:00,198,drop shot has become my go to technique for many species in last 2 seasons.

852880,wkimwes,2014-05-09 17:11:00,76,Yes do this all the time.  Great technique for all types of species.  I even caught an OOS Pike last Sunday.

853507,The Urban Fisherman,2014-05-13 16:36:00,2050,forget the dropshot - I like going after my crappie with a micro crankbait! )  Dropshots work great though... nice haul!
