851784,irishfield,2014-05-03 19:49:00,26272,Yes... that's Temagami Marine's boat launch in Inlet Bay.. Generally the first area for the ice to let go with Lowell Lake pouring into it and were Darren from Lakeland Airways first stages his Beaver at his Mother's dock waiting for Portage Bay to open up. And speaking of the Portage Bay.. which is just North of Inlet Bay with the PPark separating them. My neighbour rode his sled over and checked how my docks survived the winter yesterday!

851842,Dan668,2014-05-04 02:50:00,1120,Crappy weather tomorrow. Anyone going to be out on gbay?
851859,Big Cliff,2014-05-04 09:40:00,6899,I was hoping to get out today but with NW winds of 35k gusting to 54 for the Lindsay area I might just delay my first trip out this year until Monday.
852232,irishfield,2014-05-06 02:51:00,26272,"Inlet Bay today on Lake Temagami.. again, one of the first places to let go on the lake. This looks like about 3 days to go.. .the rest of the lake will be a week plus behind that I suspect."
852299,Parnelly,2014-05-06 18:23:00,108,Man its gonna be a close one this year. Hope the weather this week and next can take care of that ice.
852314,irishfield,2014-05-06 20:54:00,26272,-C temps at night aren't helping!
852315,Parnelly,2014-05-06 21:00:00,108,"-C temps at night aren't helping! Indeed.  From what I have seen documented over at Ottertooth, this year might make the record for the latest ice out since 1986. Of course thats other than the 2 years they dont have documented."

852439,irishfield,2014-05-07 13:53:00,26272,A slow process when it refreezes every night! They now think the Bay might open by Friday and the rest of the lake generally a week later!
852628,Joeytier,2014-05-08 14:09:00,3990,Laker lake opened up around here on Monday/Tuesday...spent yesterday trolling the ice line with no luck...good to finally be back on the softwater though!

853217,irishfield,2014-05-11 22:57:00,26272,"As of 3 pm this afternoon,  Portage Bay is almost ice free from Town out to the O'Connor Island flasher. My neighbour checked my docks for damage this afternoon.. this time in a boat. NE Arm is still locked up... but should go in a few days."
853219,Parnelly,2014-05-11 22:59:00,108,I heard a lot of it broke up today. Many from bear Island are putting boats in today as well. Looks like I'll be good to go come friday for the drive down to cross.

I went for a scoot down some logging roads behind my place and the snow is about 80% gone and the pot lakes are wide open.

Trouble is the ice is only a couple feet outside the boat house and he can't get the boat out.  Gonna be a tense few more days until hopefully the water level drops a bit.
