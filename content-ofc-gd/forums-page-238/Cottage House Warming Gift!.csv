After a while I figure this belonged back where I found it. I designed a wooden sign, (something you see ona golf course) with the family's last name, had it carved out  and mounted the shed. They now use it has a hat rack as you walk in the door. Everyone is happy.  me for the creative and they for the thought and use!  Something rustic is always welcome.  Cliff, no French for you lol"
852764,chris.brock,2014-05-08 23:57:00,4053,"personalized guest register book is cool.  lots of pages and lots of memories of those you shared memorable times with at your place.  I'll 2nd this idea,  we have one, the guests and my wife like writing in it, each page has a date, the weather, who was there, what we did, what we saw, favorite moments  when I skim though it, it helps keep track of the smaller details  when we got it, I thought it was cheesy, now I think it's great"

852675,jimmer,2014-05-08 17:25:00,2730,They all sound great. This is the place to ask when you need some answers. Something historical for the area is always cool. A good map of the area/lake on the wall is always nice for visitors. Hard to pass up on the French maid though.
852738,vance,2014-05-08 22:18:00,719,"This is what I did for my buddy and his wife for their cottage. Step 1-,got a large old circular saw blade(30in),Step 2- got a buddy to clean it up,Step 3- I took lots of pics of the cottage from the water,step 4 - had an artist friend paint on the saw blade  a picture of the cottage.Everybody LOVED  it...Ok it did take about a year to put this all together but it worked out great.  vance"

852749,Big Cliff,2014-05-08 22:59:00,6899,"Tried the French maid idea once, wife told me that by the time the divorce was over I wouldn't even have the cottage never mind the French maid. I think I'd scrap that idea if I were you.  The map is a really good idea, I have seen many of them in friends cottages, you never get tired of looking at them!  I nice sign would also work, many others have nice signs but their's would be unique!  Good on you for taking the time to try to find the ""perfect"" gift, says a lot about your character!"
