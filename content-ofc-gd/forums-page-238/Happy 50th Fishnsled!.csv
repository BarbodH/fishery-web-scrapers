852578,ccmtcanada,2014-05-08 01:58:00,7971,Happy Birthday Will!! Had a great day out on the water as usual!
852589,fishnsled,2014-05-08 02:44:00,3520,Shhhhhhhh.....  trying to keep the 50 thing a secret.....LOL!  Thanks everyone!  A fun day on the water is what the doctor ordered.  It was to be Lake O but with the winds in the forecast we headed to the Kawarthas for some pike.  Found some sweet water with warmer temps and a couple of fish made their way to the boat along with a few swing and misses.  Not a bad way to spend the day at all.  Didn't even see another boat! Don't think I've ever had a day like that in the Kawarthas.  Great having you along for the maiden voyage Cliff!
