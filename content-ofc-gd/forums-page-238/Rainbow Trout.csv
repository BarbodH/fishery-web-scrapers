In the meantime, I found other species to fill in the gaps. Here is my first ever rainbow trout. Wishing everyone a fun and safe opening weekend.    "

853339,misfish,2014-05-12 20:11:00,29133,Nice fish. Looks like you cooked it PERFECT.
853349,chris.brock,2014-05-12 20:53:00,4053,"that's a good sized stocked bow, it's your first but I bet it won't be your last"
853362,Joeytier,2014-05-12 22:36:00,3990,Nice bow!  Lots of places to find them around here and you can get them much bigger than that even...how did you cook it?  I'm drooling over here
853465,LucG,2014-05-13 12:39:00,779,"Definitely won't be my last. He did crash the surface, even more so than a bass.  I marinated it in soy sauce and brown sugar, then slapped it on the BBQ. Cooked both sides, charred the skin real good, flesh flaked off perfectly leaving the bitter darker flesh behind. Was surprised to see how orange the meat was."
