They don't do much fishing and are used to the fish at the cottage off the dock, the dink sunfish and perch that bite plain hooks every cast. I will need a spot with constant action for the little ones to keep them occupied. Don't really care about what species, preferably little panfish as that is what there used to catching. Any spots on the grand within half an hour of Caledonia? I would want to go to Binbrook, but they don't want to go in my canoe. If you have any suggestions let me know! Maybe I could direct you onto some of my special Grand spots for Wally's and big bass come summer   Thanks fellas"
