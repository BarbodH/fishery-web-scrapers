Im mostly a 99.9% catch and release guy as my love for the sport greatly out weighs a need for fish in my freezer. Now to the point, should we not be putting it all back for the next month or so, in an attempt to help out our fish friends? Just sort of seems logical, this forum alone has enough members to hopefully make a difference in our Province....Thoughts?"

852722,Sinker,2014-05-08 20:32:00,8692,"They spawned a long time ago. Sometimes under the ice, but usually when the lakes are covered, but current areas are open. They might still be in current areas......  The big threat now is lowering water levels, when the fish spawned in VERY high water. The eggs could be left high and dry.  S."
