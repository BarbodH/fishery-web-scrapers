Ya,couldnt sleep. I have to admit,it feels like we just finished the closer on the ice, and we were back at it again. This time with warmer conditions. No dragging huts,augers and rods behind us.  Greeted with a great sun rise and a nice boat ride out to our grounds.        Knowing this year was going to be a lot different opener then past years due to the late ice out and water temps colder then norm (40 degrees on the surface),the plan was, going to be  slow troll with flutter spoons.  Get the rods loaded and we are trolling for opening day lakers.  We had a few hits and miss,s to start our morning. Bait fish is stupid crazy out there. With the amount of bait we marked,we were thinking why would they hit a shiny hard lure,when they can have some nice soft meat to chow down on.   Then it happened.  Rod goes off . Grab and give a few good hauls to make sure the hook is set. Thats when I say holy crap,it,s a good one. Line is slowly leaving the reel . Yup,this is a good one. With just a steady thumping from depths below,I just play the game and retrieve one turn at a time. Thinking Im making ground,it want to make another dive. Down,down it went again.  After about a 10 minute battle,I start to make ground. Reel, lower the rod,reel, lower the rod and begin to make ground. We can finally see it. Nice fish. I say there,s one following it. Start laughing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I,ll let the vid  tell the rest of the  story. A first for me.     I kept the smaller of the two for a friend, and released the larger one.       Thanks again for a memorable day of fishing buddy.      "

Didnt see you out there Dave    Will,it would of still been there when you got home."
853058,fishnsled,2014-05-10 20:14:00,3520,"    Will,it would of still been there when you got home.  True enough Brian but the parts place would have been closed."

853061,spincast,2014-05-10 20:34:00,3279,"nice ! had that with a pair of bass once on a single jerk bait, but that is pretty cool.  I had a similar experience with the bait fish this morning - found one cloud over 20 foot tall and filled the split screen on my elite 5. But nothing around. Hopefully tomorrow will be more productive."
853064,Spiel,2014-05-10 20:45:00,9065,"I've lost count of how many times that's happened to me on Lake O, but it's cool every time it happens."
