852792,Fisherpete,2014-05-09 02:23:00,1814,"What is the structure like where you will be trolling?  If it's weedy, troll a big spinnerbait. If it's more open water/rocks etc. I would troll a 9"" Grandma or a 10"" Jake."
852804,cowanjo,2014-05-09 03:10:00,249,"Ten baits - you wish, you never started fishing musky.  My list in order  1. Golden Bomber Barramundi lure - Roaring Dan will attest 2. Handlebarz black 3. Red October Sharpie 4. Red October Black 5. Shadzilla cisco 6. H210 black 7. Handlebarz Durado 8. Believer Walleye 10 inch 9. Rubber Chicken Perch 10. Handlebarz  Orange Black  Finally get the best net man in the world who will just keep your head up and fishing as it can become a grind. Also fish with someone on the board, I thank Mike parker for my passion - I fished with him with brownie and I can work out that's where my obsession began  John"
852952,SuperDave,2014-05-10 00:28:00,204,"Top ten is difficult ... to start you need a topwater lure of some kind Topraider easiest to use and it produces... A bucktail or 2 ... you didn't say what type of reel you had so stick with Mepps musky killers they catch fish ... A body bait or crankbait .. an 8"" Jake is perfect to cast or troll a depthraider will get down deep cast or trolled... Soft plastics ... a bulldawg but remember you need a rod that can throw them... Not ten but who needs ten baits? That's why most of us muskie nuts have hundreds of 'em LOL"
853069,landry,2014-05-10 22:16:00,1005,"I would start with three: 1. A double 8 or 10 bucktail in black and nickel 2. A white tube around 9-10"" ( fish it like a jerkbait) 3. A couple mag dawgs (black n orange and Cisco) 4. Swim jig:) I like to start with some speed and then move to a jerk and pause type lure if they don't seem active. Developing confidence in a few lures and learning one lake is usually better than throwing every lure in the box and following the latest hotspot tip IMO. STart on the kawarthas so u have some eat success and action and then move where the big girls live."
853189,Maverick,2014-05-11 19:22:00,371,"Thanks for all the replies. I found a guy on kijiji selling musky lures so I went over to see what he had. The guy had a hundreds of baits, they were all labelled and he gave me great a price. Here is what I picked up, some of the colour schemes might not work but that can be changed.    Starting from the left going down the rows there's  9"" Grandma 10"" Slammer Big Fork Lures Jointed 8"" River Rat Jointed 8"" Believer 9"" Suick 9"" Sledge 7"" Sledge Stidham Z180 ? Not sure what the one top right is....anyone? Gries Tackle Topkick Super Spin Windels Musky Chugger Hellraiser Tackle Rattlin' Woodtick  Along with the 2 spinnerbaits and one bucktail. He wasn't selling many of his bucktails so I will have to pick up a couple. I had wanted to get some of Handlebarz anyways. I think this assortment of different types should get me started and I didn't break the bank. I tried to pick what people suggested, then I thought some looked cool as well. It'll be fun to see if that pink Woodtick works, I am doubting it but it looks cool. He didn't have any Jakes but the Grandma and Slammer looked similar and he didn't have a Topraider to sell be the Topkick looked along the same lines. He had a jailbird Believer but he wouldn't part with it.  Does anyone know the name of the top right corner lure and what it's action is? Any comments on that assortment?  Thanks for all the info so far, would be totally lost without it."
853197,Raf,2014-05-11 20:45:00,3495,the one on the top right looks to be a hawg wabbler.  it's a slow moving surface lure that makes a good racket up top.  i'd spray bomb it black.
853198,lew,2014-05-11 20:56:00,12766,"You got some decent baits there Maverick and it's a good start.  Those Sledges are excellent baits, and hopefully  you got the weighted ones as their much easier to work, but even un-weighted will put some fish in your boat.  The Suick is also a great bait and like the Sledge they take a bit to figure out the best way to work them but once you get onto them, their one of the best baits around."
853206,Gregoire,2014-05-11 21:46:00,1397,"I initially thought Hawg Wabbler as well, and would not be in a huge rush to spray it (although I love black lures).Try it during light changes or dusk and dawn early in the season and work it slow. On a slow day try trolling with the sledges."
853223,Fisherpete,2014-05-12 00:19:00,1814,"If you are still looking for more cranks for your collection, I posted a set of 8 really good ones for sale in the classifieds tonight.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=74594&st=0&p=853221"
852365,Maverick,2014-05-07 00:59:00,371,"I am new to musky fishing and I am looking to put together a musky box. I only have an orange buck tail and a black and orange bull dawg. I will be mostly fishing Cache Bay and the west side of Nipissing, might venture to Trout Lake or Nosbonsing.  My question is, if you could only take 10 lures, what would they be and in what colour?"
852371,Nipfisher,2014-05-07 01:15:00,2449,Handelbarz double 9s or 10s in any combination of  black / silver / orange / copper. You an cast or troll with them.  You can get them from member/owner MikeP here or at North Bay Outfitters.   P.S. even if you have 100 lures you will mostly use10 or less confidence baits.

852403,ckrb2007,2014-05-07 03:14:00,449,Check out Water Wolf Lures. They have some awesome stuff there.
852405,lew,2014-05-07 09:57:00,12766,"These 5 have been my best producers for years and the large black/orange spinnerbait at the top gets most of my muskies in your area.  These baits are all in the 8""-10"" range.  Throw in a mix of different colored large bucktails and your all set.  "
852406,ccmtcanada,2014-05-07 10:50:00,7971,Suicks are my go to lure....but I hooked by biggest musky ever on a Jake on Lake Nipissing!
852409,muskymatt,2014-05-07 11:26:00,2608,"That's so funny Lew, I have 2, yes 2, not one, but 2 Jointed jailbird Believers in my box I have used over the last 15 years and I think I have had one fish on it. Must just be me cause others talk about it as a hot bait and you have it in your top five.  Bulldogs are also a great bait"
852410,lew,2014-05-07 11:37:00,12766,"The Jailbird has worked very well for me over the years Matt but I remove the rattles from them, infact I remove the rattles from most of my Believers and that seems to make a big difference, specially in clear water. For dark or murky water, or trolling after dark I use baits with the rattles still in place.  That Double ""D"" was originally a different color that didn't do much, but after I painted it Jailbird it became one of my best producers."
852412,jbailey,2014-05-07 11:50:00,866,"a believer, a jake, a sledge, a bulldawg, a spinner, and after watching that episode of uncut angling I want one of those umbrella rigs haha"
852427,outllaw,2014-05-07 12:49:00,1232,cast or troll.?
852449,Maverick,2014-05-07 14:38:00,371,"Thanks for all the replies guys. So I'm guessing you don't match the hatch with musky because I don't think I've seen anything local that looks like the jailbird colour.  cast or troll.?  I usually fish for bass so I like casting but whatever works best. I've only fished for them 3 times and haven't caught one yet so I'm not ruling out any method.  Couple more questions, what pound test line should I be spooling on my reel? What type, strength, length of leaders should I be looking at?"
852451,Fang,2014-05-07 14:50:00,1330,Early in season I prefer #5/6 bucktails like the Mepps Muskykiller and Blue Fox and then go bigger through the summer and fall  Big spinnerbaits too like Lew posted  Gotta have a couple jerk baits like suicks and sledge  One of my better go to casting baits that has works in a number of different lakes is the Rapala Super Shad - Perch and Crawfish color  and tried and true top raider (also pack a change of shorts for the first few times you throw that)
852452,mike rousseau,2014-05-07 14:53:00,4661,"For trolling  Stalkers 10"" Jakes 10""... Also great for casting Jake 8""... Also great for casting Depth raider  Casting  Double 10s... Handlebarz are nice Bulldogs Top raider Sledge Red October tubes Storm kicking minnow... Don't laugh... They work... Get the purple one..."
852454,lew,2014-05-07 14:58:00,12766,"  Couple more questions, what pound test line should I be spooling on my reel? What type, strength, length of leaders should I be looking at?  All a personal choice, but myself I use 80# Power Pro for casting and 100# for trolling.  I make my own leaders using 130# Seaguar fluoro and crimps and use around 18"" for casting and roughly 48"" for trolling."
852477,porkpie,2014-05-07 18:36:00,2521,"I don't specifically target muskies much anymore, but when I did, my most prolific baits where a large black spinnerbait and a large black and yellow spinnerbait.  I also took many on larger buzzbaits.  I never trolled a great deal for Muskie, so I'm not much help there!"
852480,Sinker,2014-05-07 18:50:00,8692,"That top spinnerbait Lew posted is one of my all time favourites too. Any bucktail or spinnerbait will work, as long as its black and orange  S."

852504,misfish,2014-05-07 20:30:00,29133,No one mentioned a worm harness
852505,Raycaster,2014-05-07 20:32:00,528,I know Lew would know best but has anyone fished Cache Bay lately? Last time I was there it was 100% cabbage with zero chance of retrieving any musky lure more than 5 feet without super polarized xray glasses on for guidance. Medium spinner baits seemed the least likely to tow back a 100 sq ft block of weeds.  Very successful with pike on Cache bay due to the weeds but can't imagine double tens...
852561,Rich Clemens,2014-05-08 00:40:00,3131,I am throwing the Double Cowgirls probably 90% of the time and have been doing quite well with em.  Mine are black in color with either silver or copper blades.
852573,Gregoire,2014-05-08 01:39:00,1397,"I've never really used the jailbird pattern, but have a few jailbird lures, always thought it was cool looking. I'll run them a bit more this year, maybe even remove the rattles from a jailbird believer I have. I tossed spinnerbaits last year a bit more and landed a pb....walleye. I doubt anyone had ever been more pissed to hook a 32"" walter. I'll have to keep throwing them this year...the black and orange has been an effective lure for me. Instead of suiks I throw hose jerks now...I can get the action I want from them without having to go through the pain of tuning them like you do a suik. Some days the fish just want rubber, a black and orange dawg is a good bait, but I prefer tubes. A more versatile bait that can be fished different ways depending on how it is rigged. I have a legend perchbait in natural perch that has gotten me a few fish in the past. A bit on the expensive side, until you get into custom baits, and it will seem cheap. I also like the chrome shallow raiders and flash jakes or grandma's in perch. One other bait that I have had luck with is the dadson vortex double ten in the hideout walleye pattern with the marabou, not flashabou. Some people like to fish side to side gliders, and have luck with them, but I have never gotten a fish on one. I think Jim Saric had some luck two years ago with a black head gold flash body phantom a few years ago. That would be a good option as well. Restricting yourself to 10 baits is really a practice in futility if you catch the Musky Bug. I have been cleaning out my garage lately, and have counted around 200 baits so far, and am still finding lures in nooks and crannies. The funny thing is that all the baits I use are in cowajo's garage at his cottage. I think this year I will do a full inventory and sell off the ones that I do not use."
852586,mike rousseau,2014-05-08 02:25:00,4661,My PB was on a worm harness... Lol  Seriously
852593,Maverick,2014-05-08 03:50:00,371,"Man, thanks to everyone who has replied. There's so much to learn and only 5 weeks to learn it, haha.  I think this year I will do a full inventory and sell off the ones that I do not use.  Let me know what you plan on selling, I will probably be interested   Funny how you catch the unexpected sometimes. Caught my PB pike, 33lbs, fishing for walleye with a jig and grub tipped with a minnow."
852736,Fisherpete,2014-05-08 21:36:00,1814,"If I was to only have 10 lures with me... hmmm...  Three twin 10's (natural/dark/bright) Three minnow baits, 8-10"" (natural/dark/bright) One spinnerbait One glide bait One surface bait One big plastic  Early season some smaller lures should also be in your box... 5-6"" minnow baits... size 5/6 blades...  I could probably put together a 10 lure package for you if you were interested.  Pete"
852781,Freshtrax,2014-05-09 01:25:00,2215,"Kind of a side note,   But if you only had two lures to troll for muskies what would they be?   I'm thinking of taking the long slow route to our campsite on the French this year ... It's about 20 km west of hwy 69"
