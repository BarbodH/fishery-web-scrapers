(I'm only 17 and going to school next year!)I've read that in the Georgian Bay/Beaver River area there may be some pike fishing opportunities, anyone able to confirm this? I believe bass are still out of season unfortunately so I won't be worried about those.I don't believe I have access to a boat so shore fishing opportunities are mainly what I'm after. If anyone has any spots to check out or even tips on the right kind of bait this time of year (I've got a host of spinners, spoons and minnow lures) I would really appreciate it.PMs are always welcome.Thanks a ton everyone!Warren"

Don't know about pike, theres good smallie fishing in the area when it opens though, depending on when you're coming from, you could try the notty at wasaga beach, i usually get a few pike down there but not too big (4-5 pounders). You could also try somewhere along the pretty river, tons of resident rainbows in there and will hit pretty much anything you offer."
