I cast over to the spot and nailed the largie. Reeled it in and the dragon fly was in full form alive in the bass' mouth. Released the bass and the dragon fly managed to still fly, although a bit tattered.  Top water bass style for browns on lake O when they shy away from other baits was pretty cool."

I don't know what the regs are for using live or dead mammals for bait. There sure are plenty of them and after all they are vermin. We've heard the urban legend about using live kittens and Gerbils ( different vermin) for Musky. (wow the girls just tied the game up). OK, we used the old tried and true pieces of salami, hot dogs, cheese etc. for panfish as kids and still use shrimp for big cats on the Grand. I think the craziest bait I've used is perch eyes for perch icefishing, I don't hear about using them as bait here. Tried a Birch leaf once with a hook and split shot, never got one but my buddy got a bluegill with some type of tree leaf.  What is the craziest bait you've used and actually caught a fish with it?"

Suddenly mayflies started hatching everywhere and the lake came alive with surface feeding whitefish.  My uncle loved whitefish and he went berserk as did I trying to catch them with small spinners and such.  Finally we switched to a red and white bobber, single small hook and a live mayfly. We'd lob them out into the melee then slowly twitch and drag the live mayflies back towards us. We ended up catching a bunch and it was honestly more memorable for me than the actual fly in trip."

As kids/teenagers, we would be sent to clean out the boatshed every once in a while. Rodents loved the coils of rope and assorted materials for brightwork and coirwork (both the grandfather and great uncle were well seasoned sailors). One of us would gingerly move the piles, the second would chase rodents with the broom, the third of us scooped the mice with the net. Live mouse, hooked lightly through the skin, tossed out to swim top water. There was no better live presentation for big bass and pike. We caught hundreds with the mice."

Before you judge these examples were when I was in my teens.  Bacon slice on 5 of diamonds for bull trout.  Bull trout also had a fondness for fighting 30cm grayling.  Once caught a large carp on a ruby-eye spoon - unexpected.  Heard a crazy story once about guys rigging up a squirrel and repeatedly pulling the poor thing off a surfboard in muskie infested waters.
