This spring has come late with ice out just occurring recently---so of course the water has not warmed up much.  Many may think that a PFD makes you bulletproof----it does'nt----that cold water can affect your body rapidly ---hypothermia---shock--etc.  Everyone wants to get out and play after a long winter-----includes maybe taking chances in small craft---canoes/kayaks---or even high water wading---due to late run off  Learn or ask--- and take precautions on what you need to do to stay safe.--Cold water acts quickly  Now none of us are born with this information----someone told us to help out---now we're passing it along  Have fun though
