I was sooooo tempted to make a quick run to the lake before picking up the kids. Maybe Wednesday afternoon.  Winter was too long.  "

852358,kickingfrog,2014-05-07 00:42:00,8333,Someone else is almost water ready.    Came home with the kids and had to spend 5 minutes explaining that just because the pool was in front of our house doesn't mean it's ours.
