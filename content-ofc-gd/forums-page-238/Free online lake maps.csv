853120,bayofquintecharters,2014-05-11 11:59:00,9,I can't remember is someone on here mentioned or not that the Navionics maps can now be accessed online for free by anyone.  Just go to www.navionics.com    Click on the webapp at the top and choose marine and lakes.    Zoom in to an area and dont forget to click the little sonar charts icon. Look at the detail difference.  This is the same as the Navionics + upgrade on your phone or ipad.  All for FREE!!!! its awesome.  Without Sonar Charts on    After Sonar Charts is on    Scott

853133,limeyangler,2014-05-11 13:09:00,5204,"That is pretty cool. Just wondering though, are the paid for maps more detailed? I'm looking at a section of Lac Seul that i fish, none of the structure i know is there is marked, the map gives very basic and general depths for the area. Tried zooming right inâ€¦.NADA! The area has some relatively large and defined reefs and drop offs."

853142,didoban,2014-05-11 14:26:00,65,I have the updated maps on my tablet and smartphone. Works great. The upgrade maps shows shallower depts. For the basic lake maps is $14.99 and updated map is another $5.
