He stated that while he was scuba diving in these ponds he was able to extend the full length of his arm into fish feces.  And people consume these fish?  UGGG!  Also another story about the fish raised in China.  They hang wire cages full of live chickens over top of the fish farm ponds.  The chicken droppings end  in the ponds which the fish consume!  You want those fish on your dinner plate??  I rarely buy store bought fish unless it states ""wild pacific salmon"" or some other statement meaning it's not farm raised for these 2 reasons."
