I could support the licensing only for the reporting aspect, but flip those numbers, give them an 80% discount, or make it a one time payable for a ""lifer license""...or just requirement to keep their info up to date for survey collections  if the argument is presented that many rely on fishing to put food on the table, I see benefit in asking for those harvest stats, especially on some lakes  if an organization, say OFAH, started a fund for licenses for seniors/anybody on restricted income, I'd donate to that every year"

MNR is proposing that those aged 65 and over pay 80 per cent of the cost of a regular fishing licence.  Potential introduction of senior citizens fishing licences. At present, Ontario and Canadian residents aged 65 and older fish for free in Ontario. This practice is inconsistent with other public licensing systems in the province such as driver's licences, pilot's licences, camping fees and hunting licences. Without licence requirements there are inequities, gaps in the ministry's information regarding harvest, and the number of seniors that fish. Ontario is also the only Great Lake province or state in which resident senior citizens can fish for free. The Harris/Decima survey demonstrated very strong support for introducing a discounted licence for seniors. MNR is therefore proposing (Table 2) a discounted Seniors Conservation Fishing Licence and a discounted Seniors Sport Fishing Licence at 80 per cent of the standard fee.No changes are proposed to the requirement for non-Canadian residents aged 65 and older who currently must purchase an Outdoors Card and a regular-priced fishing licence. Taken from an MNR document entitled Sustainability Strategy for the Fish and Wildlife Special Purpose Account. Page 30"

Over the past couple of decades we have seen more and more anglers purchasing licenses. Increase in costs of licenses. Then came the implementation of the Outdoors Card. More funds for the Government.  Many hatcheries have been closed. Those that aren't are being run by volunteers. Stream rehabilitation has been left to volunteers. Enforcement is cut to the bone. So much so that the CO's are limited as to how much gas they can use on a monthly basis.   As with all things Government run, poorer service, more excuses and greater costs."

How much money do they think this is going to generate, fire one politician and you'd probably double what they will collect from us seniors that can still fish. Oh, and BTW I still have to work because there is no way I could live in this country based on a pension plan that I have paid into for all these years and watched our goverment squander to fill their own pockets.  If they do impliment this you can watch for this old man to get charged for fishing without a license because I WILL NOT BUY another one! When I don't pay the fine, they can put me in jail: 3 meals a day, medical, dental, TV (bet I can get lots of fishing shows).  I am so ready to join any revolution that opposes the way people are treated in this country. Oh, and one last question: Why is it we keep hearing that CPP is going to run out of money but welfare isn't? Seems to me that I have paid into CPP, who has paid into welfare?
