Thanks in advance! "
852886,jimmer,2014-05-09 17:59:00,2730,401 to 115 to County Road 10 (Millbrook) go north past Hwy 7 and Emily Park is on the left. If you make your first left past the park it will take you to a bridge that people fish from. You can also continue on County Rd 10 which turns into Yankee line and that will take you to the Causeway on Chemong Lake which gives you more space to fish. Watch the regulations on the causeway if you're planning on fishing there this weekend.

852921,SBCregal,2014-05-09 22:42:00,688,"the walk down to the water goes down a pretty steep hill near emily park.  probably not the best bet for anyone with mobility problems.  ryan   edit.... you could probably fish from the docks in the park itself, I don't imagine the weeds would be too bad this time of year."
853265,Paudash,2014-05-12 03:33:00,273,"or you can fish from the docks/boat launch in Omemee, for anyone with mobility issues this would be your best bet"
