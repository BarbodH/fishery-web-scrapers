Went down to the lake this evening (Thursday 1st May) to check the conditions. There was 2'4"" of ice off my skidoo tracks. Some areas were one foot of water with one foot of clear ice. Its gonna be close this year….i'm not too sure it will all be gone in 2 weeks. Here is the video and pics i took out front this evening.   "

851669,pike slayer,2014-05-03 11:21:00,1177,im on a small inland lake in the sault and my lake looks kinda like that. lots of water on the ice the shore lines are breaking up and the springs out on the lake are opened up. i think you could get a boat in 2 weeks with ice bergs floating around

I'm flying out of White River on June 6 now, not worried about that. But I'm now slated to fish a small brook trout lake NW of Wawa on May 21. That could be dicey I think....."
