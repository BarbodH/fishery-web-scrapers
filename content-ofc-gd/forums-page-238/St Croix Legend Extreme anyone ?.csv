853386,Pigeontroller,2014-05-13 00:27:00,2793,"St Croix. Pure crap in my opinion. Unless you buy their top of the line. Okuma or anything else will do just fine for the price.  Hogwash, St.Croix has the most extensive line up of rods out there, backed by an excellent warranty and customer service record.  Nobody says YOU have to use them, but calling St.Croix pure crap is just...well pure crap!"
853387,GbayGiant,2014-05-13 00:33:00,1780,Okuma makes a far superior rod for the price with comparable St crap rod. Okuma do not fall apart or break.   
853397,Gregoire,2014-05-13 00:55:00,1397,"I'll give a vote to St Croix. Their Legend Tournament Rods are the best musky rods I have used, I have an Okuma EVX and it is a horrible rod compared to the LT Big Nasty. Cowanjo and I just got two new Sling Blades due to warranty issues. There may be better musky rods out there, but not at that price point or with the same warranty."
853419,Steve,2014-05-13 02:14:00,2075,i like to save these threads.  its not often you hear folks speaking higher of okuma than st croix.  each to their own
853420,irishfield,2014-05-13 02:32:00,26272,Not sure what model.. but fishing on Pike opener with Andy last year (on his birthday) and he was none too happy that two brand new St. Croixs snapped in half on casts with nothing but a crank bait on. He called Brian right from the boat to complain and it appeared it was a common problem with last years stock!
853428,porkpie,2014-05-13 03:00:00,2521,"LOL, this very true!!!  I am a big St. Croix fan myself, having 8 of their rods at last count but far be it from me to stop someone from loving on Okuma!"
853486,bare foot wader,2014-05-13 15:06:00,1354,"Not sure what model.. but fishing on Pike opener with Andy last year (on his birthday) and he was none too happy that two brand new St. Croixs snapped in half on casts with nothing but a crank bait on. He called Brian right from the boat to complain and it appeared it was a common problem with last years stock!  interesting, sounds like a known issue and they still make the customer pay....perhaps I have different standards for ""excellent"" customer service  I've snapped 2 avid's, won't be buying more....the guy seemed offended that I asked why I should pay shipping both ways...""IF we find it to be a manufacturing issue we will ship new, or if not we will call for your credit card""  the legend extreme seems over priced, at the same price point or cheaper shimano/gloomis, dobyn's offer a lot of competition and IMO better than st Croix...if the OP likes the handle on the new legend extremes, try looking at the airrus nano rods, very good rods...I just ordered an iRod that I haven't fished yet, another option to consider if you don't mind ordering online, again cheaper"
853489,2 tone z71,2014-05-13 15:16:00,1311,Thank guys..I am a big St Croix fan ..tried most of the rest..only thing I was not  sure on is the new handle design ..i am kinda fond to the cork
853512,BillM,2014-05-13 17:55:00,17367,"I like cork as well, call me old fashioned, but split grips just don't do anything for me..   So is there a manufacturer out there (High end) that will do over the counter exchanges for the life of the rod?"
853536,Lunatic,2014-05-13 19:37:00,536,"i like cork as well.my shimano crucial has that new rubber grip and i was stand offish about it at first but im really diggin it now. i have a st croix mojo bass rod as well. i like it,but i have to re-tighten the reel seat every 5 - 10 casts it seems."
853147,2 tone z71,2014-05-11 15:10:00,1311,looking for some feed back before I pull the trigger on one please
853149,Fisherpete,2014-05-11 15:17:00,1814,Muskie ones are incredible.
853152,Dan668,2014-05-11 15:31:00,1120,Which model?
853153,Steve,2014-05-11 15:35:00,2075,"they are a good, higher end rod ...  i own a spinning version and a bc version.  they are not as high end as a NRX, but compared to rods I've owned, they are the next closest."
853154,2 tone z71,2014-05-11 15:41:00,1311,Ive got a few of the Legend Tournaments  that I absolutely Love ..even got a soft spot for my Eyecon  ..I'm looking  at something in the 7 ft - range spinning  for Walleye
853159,lew,2014-05-11 15:59:00,12766,I use a Tournament musky series and although I've never tried the walleye models I'd assume their equally great.
853160,mike rousseau,2014-05-11 16:05:00,4661,I've got one and love it...  The new ones have a zero cork handle now tho... Not sure how those are
853171,NANUK,2014-05-11 16:51:00,797,Very nice rods and a great company to deal with.  They are not as high end as NRX because they don't have all those problems like NRX have.
853172,2 tone z71,2014-05-11 16:58:00,1311,I use a Tournament musky series and although I've never tried the walleye models I'd assume their equally great. Lew I agree I can feel every turn of the blade at 30 ft out or when it snags a weed top water ..its amazing well worth it
853173,2 tone z71,2014-05-11 16:59:00,1311,I've got one and love it...  The new ones have a zero cork handle now tho... Not sure how those are that's more less what i was wondering how those new grips are
853235,Pigeontroller,2014-05-12 01:31:00,2793,Muskie ones are incredible.  No such animal...
853295,bare foot wader,2014-05-12 14:37:00,1354,"after snapping 2 avids last year, I'm not a fan of their warranty policy, they make the customer pay shipping both ways which is unusual in my experience...I guess if you live close enough to a retailer maybe it's over the counter still...if you had a 2 piece rod you could order a new tip section for 50....which is quick enough turnaround but still more expensive than paying shipping one way, as it should be IMO"
853307,mike rousseau,2014-05-12 16:02:00,4661,Considering almost every rod I've ever seen break in my life was user error... I think it's fair you pay the shipping to have your $150-400+ dollar rod replaced at no cost....  I bought my legend extreme (worth over $400) knowing if it break I get a brand new one for about $50 in shipping for the rest of my life.... That sounds like a good deal for me...  But then again not everyone can admit they break rods because of user error so they feel it's the companies fault and bash em for the MED LIGHT spinning rod spooled with 50lb braid breaking when they were snagged on a log and trying to rip it out.... Lol... Not saying your one of those guys tho...  I'm just surprised theses companies replace rods no matter why they broke...  Eventually all rod makers will be producing ugly sticks to avoid replacing under warranty... Lol
853313,bare foot wader,2014-05-12 16:14:00,1354,"full of assumptions there LOL...you get a pro staff/guide discount?  the avids snapped within first 3 days of use, the first rod I snapped was on the very first cast, 3 hours out of the store...9'6"" heavy action steelhead series at $260 each...I even sent a picture of the lure on an electronic scale to show I was casting well under the rod specs...it wasn't my fault  so IMO, it's not fair they make me pay shipping both ways, or pay 50 for a new tip (which isn't really warranty)...I should pay shipping one way and get a brand new rod IMO....original receipt and the rod serial number indicates the rods were newly built, not sitting in a store for 5 years  I've broke one shimano that was my fault, I told them so (flipping a bass into the boat), I paid shipping one way....never broke a loomis yet"
853314,bare foot wader,2014-05-12 16:16:00,1354,"somebody else on this board commented a while back about snapping the avids easily...just saying, their policy for customer to pay shipping both ways has turned me away....but I also prefer rods that don't break when they're brand new"
853315,musky_hunter,2014-05-12 16:24:00,328,not bad but a little tip heavy and don't like the handle. for the $ why not look at Dobyns DX?
853316,mike rousseau,2014-05-12 16:29:00,4661,"Like I said... I wasn't trying to describe you...  But some people are that way so I can't blame the rod makers for not paying the shipping...  Also I just like st croix rods... Just a regular consumer (talk about assumptions... Lol)... And my dad and brother have used their warranty because they flipped walleye in the boat that were too big without enough line out... Being idiots... Lol  I also took advantage of the ""buy a new tip"" deal for $30.. I dropped my rod being an idiot.... But when I got my package there was a complete brand new $200 rod in there...  So for the 3 of us we have had about $1000 dollars of rods replaced for the cost to ship 3 rods... And a $30 replacement fee for a tip...  And I will admit we were completely at fault and st croix wasn't responsible.... But they still replaced the rods..."
853317,BillM,2014-05-12 16:37:00,17367,"I really can't complain about the service I've gotten from St.Croix when it comes to warranty replacement.  Cheap shipping to Fedex in Canada (Who then forwards that to FedexUS), $20 return shipping for a 7ft rod in a tube in probably 2 weeks for $20 US?   Is there any company out there that does a life time warranty over the counter exchange with no questions asked for the life of the rod?"
853329,NANUK,2014-05-12 18:22:00,797,I broke 3 Fenwicks in the past ( my fault ) All 3 times I had to pay shipping to Manitoba and send a $20 check for return shipping. Still a good deal IMO
853330,bare foot wader,2014-05-12 18:27:00,1354,"there are companies that do better for brand new rod failures...for the money, I think there are rods with better warranties too, just don't agree with paying return shipping...or maybe I just spoke to a person lacking customer service skills, he didn't make me a happy camper lol  what does the OP want to do with the rod? species? techniques?"
853331,GbayGiant,2014-05-12 18:46:00,1780,St Croix. Pure crap in my opinion. Unless you buy their top of the line. Okuma or anything else will do just fine for the price.
853352,lew,2014-05-12 21:27:00,12766,"St Croix. Pure crap in my opinion.  I've had St. Croix musky rods for years , both Avids & Premiers, and never had a single issue with any of them other than one that had the reel seat come loose 8 or 9 years ago and Spiel fixed that one for me."
853354,Steve,2014-05-12 22:00:00,2075,st croix are ok rods...on par with top end shimano or other similar rods.  nothing wrong with them....
853380,Fisherpete,2014-05-13 00:07:00,1814," No such animal...  Sorry, meant the Legend Tournament as Lew mentioned."
