Why not.. you can possess guns.. shoot with them, but just can't buy anymore guns (than the 10 or 20 you already possess).

852077,craigdritchie,2014-05-05 12:03:00,1586,"Huge amount of work indeed! Nicely done though Pete, the pictures show the overall condition well. They also show that the guns were stored correctly to begin with, and that can only help enhance their value.  The Hungarian double shotgun was made by FEGARMY ARMS, which was established in 1891. FEG started out building rifles and pistols for the military, and at one point expanded to build large field guns for the Hungarian army.    While 15 cm field guns will definitely bring down ducks, they're just a little large for the average waterfowler  Following the second world war, with lucrative military contracts drying up, FEG branched into building sporting arms, including the boxlock shotgun you own. They're widely known as good quality field grade guns, very well built but lacking the delicate scroll engraving and fine-cut checkering you would find on a Browning Citori, for example (checkering on your gun is most likely stamped, rather than cut). Finish details aside, structurally and mechanically, are not much different than the much more expensive Brownings.  Unfortunately, a small domestic market and newer, stricter rules governing export put FEGARMY into bankruptcy in 2004.  So that's the story with your shotgun. Check the chokes and chamber depth. While there is a possibility it may be chambered for three inch shells, it is most likely chambered for two-and-three-quarter inch shells. A late model shotgun chambered for three-inch shells will have a higher value, mainly because it will be more useful for waterfowl hunting with steel shot (particularly if it is full choked). If it's set up as a pheasant gun (modified or improved cylinder chokes) then chamber length won't matter one bit.  Otherwise, everything looks nicely kept. There are a few love bites here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary for guns that were actually used and loved. You should have no problem getting the high end of those Blue Book values."
852093,Sinker,2014-05-05 14:27:00,8692,"Nice collection for sure. I would have a real hard time selling those if they were my grandfathers, but you won't have any trouble selling them. I assume you don't hunt at all?  S."

He passed in 1985 when I was only 10 so never had the chance to show me hunting.  I will most likely be selling the collection once I figure out exactly what they are worth, and educate myself on the legalities of selling them. I would assume that I couldn't just sell them to anyone? Anyone know all the requirements?  Craig - thanks again, great info. Much appreciated!  Pete"

852523,Sinker,2014-05-07 21:46:00,8692,"Since its a lightt model, its safe to assume its 2 3/4 only.  S."
852524,misfish,2014-05-07 21:57:00,29133," Pete,Im surprised theres not a stamped shell size on the barrels of the O/U.  Im thinking it,s 2 3/4.  The one I had  was Modified. No screw in chokes."
852527,craigdritchie,2014-05-07 22:00:00,1586,"Chamber depth information is normally stamped right on the barrel near the receiver. It usually looks like this:      If you're unable to locate this marking, then the safest route is to take the gun to a gunshop and have them check with a chamber gauge. This is a cylindrical (or sometimes flat) brass instrument made for this specific purpose. It takes two seconds, and they'll most likely do it for free.  Simply sliding a shell into the chamber is NOT an accurate way to check chamber depth, as a three inch shell will fit very comfortably into a 2-3/4 inch chamber. The chamber has to be deeper than the shell it is intended to fire, in order to accommodate the crimp at the end of the shell. When you fire the gun, the crimp unfolds and has to have someplace to go. So the chamber is always longer than the shell to allow for this.  Of course, actually firing a three inch shell in a gun with a 2-3/4 inch chamber would be catastrophic, since there is no space to accommodate the crimp. With the chamber effectivey blocked, the most common result is the shooter's head being vaporized in the resulting explosion.  If you can't find any marks on the barrel, take them to a gunsmith to be sure. They're both most likely to be 2-3/4 inch, but best to be certain. Don't screw around with a measuring tape or a fired shell ... that is just not reliable.  Cheers"
852553,Fisherpete,2014-05-08 00:18:00,1814,"Thanks again guys - I will take a look to see if it is stamped. If not, I will take it to the experts.  On another note, I had the collection appraised today at Gagnon's and there were a few pleasant surprises. The Browning 30-06 turns out to be the crown jewel of the collection, as it is classed as a grade 2 - hard to find with the engravings and a few other details/features. It was appraised at $800-900 without the scope.  The Parker Hale .243 and the Mossberg .22 were also sought after items that had some distinguishing features. The A5 and FEG shotguns were valued pretty much as expected.  Several of the scopes also have some value, including the Leopold (not in pics), and the German made ones on the Browning 30-06 and on the Marlin. We ran out of time today, so I am going to bring them back so we can find out exactly what they are worth, but he strongly suggested selling them on their own as scopes tend to lose value when bundled. That being said, I will most likely keep them paired up just as my grandfather had them, unless someone does not really want them.  Here's the numbers (not including scope values):  1)      Parker Hale .243 Win. Cal. Bolt action rifle with sling, swivels, bipod, case - $500-600 2)      Browning BAR 30-06 Semi-Automatic with sling, swivels, case - $800-900 3)      Parker-Hale (Midland) 30-06 Bolt action with sling, swivels, bipod, case - $400-600 4)      FEG Hungarian single trigger OU 12G shotgun with sling, recoil pad, case - $550-650 5)      Browning BAR A5 12G Semi-Automatic shotgun with sling, recoil pad, case - $550-650 6)      Winchester-Cooey Model 750 .22 - $125 7)      Marlin Model 89C Micro Groove .22 - $200 8)      Mossberg 42M-B .22 - $250 I appreciate the mods leaving this post here for the ‘discovery’ phase lol… but if need be please feel free to move it to the classifieds section.  I will be considering all reasonable offers. All previous PM’s have been responded to. I would LOVE for somebody to just say they will take the whole collection… and a serious discount would be applied.  Thanks again for all the help with figuring these out – the wealth of knowledge by the members of this site is incredible.  All purchases will require a PAL, and shipping is an option.  Pete"
852568,Sinker,2014-05-08 01:13:00,8692,"You should take up hunting and pass those on to your kids. That is pretty much the perfect collection of quality firearms, and having been your grandfathers, they are essentially priceless. I just couldnt sell them.

851193,Fisherpete,2014-04-30 20:47:00,1814,"My grandfather was as much a hunter as a fisherman, and my family has 7 or 8 rifles/shotguns in storage from him. I have a list of what they are, and their serial numbers. My mom had them appraised back in the early 90's, and was told that a few of them were quite valuable - two Belgian made Brownings in particular, but she has since misplaced the list of their appraised values.  Here's a list and some details:  1) Parker Hale .243 Win, Cal. Bolt action rifle equipped with a Leopold 2.5x/7 Scope, Sling and swivels 2) Browning 30-06 Semi-Automatic Rifle complete with scope, sling and swivel. Belgian made - Collectors class? 3) Parker Hale (Midland) Bolt action 30-06 rifle with scope and sling 4) Hungarian 12G single trigger over and under shotgun with sling and recoil pad 5) Browning 12G Semi-Automatic shotgun, MADE IN BELGIUM with sling and recoil pad. Collectors class? 6) Marlin .22 cal semi-automatic rifle with Safari 4x32mm scope and sling 7) Mossberg .22 cal Mag Bolt action rifle with Weaver 2.5x7 scope mounted  Does anyone know if it is possible to look up the details of these guns using their serial numbers?

851219,Ralph Field,2014-04-30 21:49:00,1018,I would look for similar guns at www.gunnutz.com to get a rough idea of their value.
851224,craigdritchie,2014-04-30 22:01:00,1586,"Nice collection of artillery, but I'm afraid none of those guns are currently worth a whole lot of money. The biggest problem is that they're all popular, well made, decent quality guns. They last forever and, as a result, there is already a ton of them out there on the used market. That depresses prices faster than anything else.  Condition obviously counts too. If they've been in storage for a long time, you'll want to hope they were put away properly in the first place, and there's no pitting inside the barrels. Too much/too little humidity is a problem for guns of any make.  The Blue Book (see http://bluebookofgunvalues.com/ ) is a decent reference for used gun values. In outstanding condition, it puts the Parker-Hales in the $200 - $400 range, the Brownings in the $350 - $600 range, and the .22s at about $75 apiece. Bear in mind these are retail selling prices. A dealer will give you much less (more like half these amounts).  Need more info on the 12 gauge O/U. There were all kinds of shotguns imported into Canada from Europe in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Depending on make, model and specs (i.e. barrel length, chokes, boxlock or sidelock action, etc) prices are all over the map, but most seem to fall into the $300 to $700 range. Could be more or less than that, depending again on specifics and condition.  Vague answers, I realize, but what they're worth on a given day really comes down to what someone is willing to pay for them."
851227,Fisherpete,2014-04-30 22:07:00,1814,"Wow Craig, thanks for all the info! Vague? Hardly!  From what I know, my grandfather's hunting buddies gave the guns all a good cleaning and oiling before they went into storage, so hopefully they should still be in good condition. I will find out tomorrow - I am going to check them out and take piles of pics.  Pete"

851242,aplumma,2014-04-30 22:55:00,6896,The checking and metal working details do make for added value so close ups would help. If you get them appraised pay to have this done by an appraiser.
