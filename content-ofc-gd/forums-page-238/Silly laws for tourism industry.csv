Man i miss working for that company. When they said safety first they actually meant it. I did catch some flack though when the CEO visited and i wrote him up on a lockout violation haha   I work in the mining industry in a surface plant.  My superintendant has made some serious safety errors in front of contractors.  As a result, it is heresay.  I would LOVE to catch him doing something like that.  He is not good a managing people."
852814,pics,2014-05-09 05:16:00,1268,"Here at a certain steel mill in the hammer it's all about limiting company liability.. break one of their cardinal rules and you are fired.. problem with that is you need power to most machines in order for trouble shoot. That's breaking a cardinal rule... we have a procedure for everything including how to remove your safety glasses, making coffee, getting into a vehicle .never the companies fault if you get hurt.. some instances result in guys being sent for drug and alcohol testing .. yet when I send them a list of deficiencies they don't get attention.. companies based out of the state's tend to be afraid of lawsuits from their employees..."
851561,manitoubass2,2014-05-02 20:13:00,11391,"Guess if you work in tourism, if your working alone near any source of water, you'll need to wear a lifejacket. Gonna look funny out on the golf course this year:) wow. New rules brought in by the ministry of labor. Learned about it today from my cousin that owns a fishing camp."
851567,bare foot wader,2014-05-02 21:23:00,1354,"Silly, perhaps, but is comparable to other industries  mine site cannot work alone near the pond or river, and both guys need to be wearing a pfd within a certain distance of water, radio contact with dispatch every 30 mins  once a couple years ago enviro samplers failed to make contact while eating lunch and whole operation shutdown for a mayday, they were a bit embarrassed at camp dinner that night...silly as they sound, SOP's are often initiated because of past incidents...I can see your point on the golf course ponds, but risk mitigation is usually a good thing, common sense does not always prevail"
851576,manitoubass2,2014-05-02 22:19:00,11391,"Well some safety measures make sense. I worked in mining and the measures we took were just commo sense, but very effective at keeping everyone safe. Same in the oilfield, but those were hard to implement because half the workforce is stoned outta their minds. When i worked in the lumber industry our safety measures were awesome, you felt 100% safe in a world class sawmill. But these seem silly and illogical. In theory, my cousin now has to wear a pfd to walk on his dock, because hes ""working""? Lol. He said hes buying floatations suits specifically for anyone that comes to check his camp hahaha, camp policy sir, now enjoy your visit in the 30 degree summer heat lol"
851595,bare foot wader,2014-05-02 22:41:00,1354,"agreed, just saying there's a Darwin award winner out there that might be saved lol...but I wonder how that will be enforced too? hopefully about as much as j-walking"
851596,irishfield,2014-05-02 22:43:00,26272,Maybe get him to bring a blow up doll to work and he'll have the not alone and pfd covered in one shot!

851608,misfish,2014-05-02 23:35:00,29133,"Heres my take on this. Yes,Im a member of the JHST..  Every month there,s a walk through both plants. We have a worker from each plant walk with two leaders.Many eyes to see around. Talk to the floor workers . Yes,even talk to those that are for a day or two or maybe even longer. Concerns are brought up. We listen and come meeting time,we need to decided if they are real concerns or just what one is thinking is a safety hazard.  If the vote is,it is,then we put in the proper PPE or guard.  Now heres where it gets all funky.  One worker is happy.,3-5 others say it makes their job harder.uncomfortable to do.  Where to draw the line.  I always tell my fellow employees. Think about what you say to the JHST. Is it really an issue?"

851617,bushart,2014-05-02 23:54:00,2628,Yes Bri---common sense left us at some time---just don't know when it was?   Manitou   where did you work for Weyerhaeuser?....I once worked for them in Dryden

851621,misfish,2014-05-02 23:58:00,29133,"And before anyone brings up the stupid thing I did , I will say I made a bad judgment. Some machines we have,you  to by pass safetys to see whats happening. Instead of stopping and adjusting,I made the error of trying to adjust while the machine was active. Quick lesson learned. I was the only one at harm at this point. All operators are kept away. Hazards of the job."
851622,bushart,2014-05-03 00:05:00,2628,Yes Manitou---I hear there are no walleyes over that way  Did ya ever fish those big whitefish in the english river?
851623,bushart,2014-05-03 00:08:00,2628,Not sure what the issue you had was Bri---I had an interview in Kamloops BC with Weyerhaeuser---that issue of troubleshooting live eqpt come up---tricky scenario
851624,Muskieman,2014-05-03 00:10:00,2472,"I can see the logic , as a guide / dock attendant at Chaudiere Lodge for some years (early 90's) , I've had my share of unintentional plunges.  One in particular comes to mind , I was moving Cedar Strips around all morning (20) getting things ready for guests arriving at 2pm , a guest from the previous week had hit a rock and cracked the casing on a 20 Yamaha, I brought the boat to dock and took off the motor , stood up and swung the motor onto the dock , I had forgot to tie up the Cedar The Cedar went out from under me and I stepped into 4' of water , soon to find a 20Hp Yamaha hitting me in the head and knocking me out , falling on my legs and pinning me underwater against a dock pillar , luckily a staff member was there to drag me out ... had I had a PFD maybe things would've been different... either way, I'm glad Dave was there."
