70705,mason05,2007-05-12 01:34:00,258,"I had the pleasure of heading into the northern interior of Algonquin with the KWP for our annual spring trip.  Temperatures were perfect.  Between 13 - 16 degrees during the day with clear skies followed by cool nights, 1 -2 degrees with star infested views.  Water temps were frigid so safety was a priority at all times.  Here's a typical morning around 7am on our host lake.  Dead calm...   Our meat boats anxiously awaiting their return to water...   Friday morning I went out for an early morning troll with my bud Satan.  We were looping back after running our typical troll route and Satan offered to paddle giving me a chance to cast around.  Second cast to a nice pocket off shore resulted in my first laker.  20"" x 38""  estimated weight 19lbs.  This big fella instantly earned me the trophy for this year...   Back at camp times were good and looking up I pondered how the mighty pine manages to climb so high considering it's growing out of a rock island.  I must mention that winter was rather harsh on the park this year as we witnessed countless monster trees ripped from the ground, root ball and all by gusty winds.  Some of the area has changed drastically since last year...   As I mentioned nights were cool which was a bonus for keeping a small amount of perishable food fresh all week.  Sleeping was made easy by simply driving some of this into your boiler...   A typical KWP lodge meeting around the fire...   We ventured to a new lake this year and upon arrival found dozens of helgamites swimming around shore.  Cleary we needed to catch some as there was no doubt those specks were feeding on these little critters.  Once we launched I quickly noticed tons of oxygen bubbles rising to the surface.  This lake was gin clear and so rich in oxygen I knew this was too good to be true.  A couple of laps trolling the perimeter produced this...    Regretfully our time was up and another spring opener is in the bag.  I had a blast this year and can't wait to return next spring or hopefully this fall if we can get the KWP together for another journey.  Before our departure I snapped one last photo of our view for a week.  Makes me realize how small we are here as there are truly bigger things at work...    Corn Nug"

70749,Golfisher,2007-05-12 04:18:00,586,"Is that a typo or is your friend's name really Satan, you know, the prince of darkness?  What is it like to have Lucifer paddle around your canoe?     A great report regardless!"
70762,wolfville,2007-05-12 05:16:00,396,Nice report....
70766,Badger Shark,2007-05-12 06:50:00,291,"Man I love these Algonquin reports, it really makes me want to get out and do this.  Someday I have to give it a try.  Thanks for the report."

70937,Pgidley,2007-05-13 00:38:00,14,"Nice Report, pity to see that big laker hanging from a tree and not back in the lake for someone else to catch. Algonquin doesn't produce big fish readily and fish like that are mighty rare."
