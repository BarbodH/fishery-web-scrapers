71095,mason05,2007-05-13 16:13:00,258,Got out this morning with a couple of friends to a local pike hole.  Nice cool crisp day with clear skies and lots of sun.  Trees are now in full bloom and the scenery was excellent.   I started using a small trout pattern rap but wasn't having any luck.  My bud showed up with some sucker minnows and I switched my rig.  Minutes later this little guy hit.   My buddy lost one too and we packed it in.  Gotta head to the folks place and do something nice for mom today.  One last shot before we left.     Corn Nug
