We were on the water by 8am last sat >Ice guy and I were both pumped cause it was our first time fishong Quinte.we travelled to the reach and started trolling planners and dipsys.two hours of nothing and then Iceguys planner goes off in about 70 feet of water down about 40. And we knew it was a biggen right away. Ive never seen a walleye that big before wow.congrats Iceguy.we fished until dusk with only one pike caught by iceguy in 100 FOT.
