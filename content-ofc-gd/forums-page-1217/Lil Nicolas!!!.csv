The doctors say he is beyond their expectations he now has a less invasive respiratory unit as you can see on his face which is better than CPAP and they said that most premies have a dysfunction with syncronizing their brain with their lungs and they will stop breathing daily. He has not done this yet!!   Everyone is well and expectations are great geez wonder what happened... OFC!
