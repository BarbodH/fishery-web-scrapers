First went to a place locals calls Puff Ball, we caught some fish...rock bass, perch, and I got one small Bass, (threw that back real quick). There was 6 other people fishing at this small bridge so we left and went to a lock14.  Set up there and within an hour and a half we had landed 5 nice walleye. The big one was about 2.5lbs and the smallest about a pound. We were using white Cotton Cordell 's and orange crawdad fat raps... Thanxs to the people knew left me some nice tips.   I dont normally eat fish but its been a long winter and I really needed to try some walleye so I deep fried them up and were very very good. My buddy took some pics but he was to drunk last night to have sent them to me to post on here but I will have them. Again Thanxs for all of your help, and please be safe out there and Have FUN"
