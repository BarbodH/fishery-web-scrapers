70592,michaelkovacs,2007-05-11 19:36:00,48,"Hey all.  Just introducing myself (apparently I better do that before posting!  :0)  Anyway, been fishign for a few years, mostly bass, pike and some panfishing when my freezer has some room!  I'm in the Niagara area, so most of my fishing is done at the Grand R., Niagara R., Fifty Point (rainbows...mmm), and some local conservation areas.  Thinking of joining a local bassmasters chapter...either Niagara, St. Catharines or Dunnville.  We'll see.  Anyway, happy fishing all!  Mike"

Hey, anyone in the market for a used car?  hahaha...  Forgot to mention Port Dalhousie too...not too bad for the trout, but not much luck this winter."
