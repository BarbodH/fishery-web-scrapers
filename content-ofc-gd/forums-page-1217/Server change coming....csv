70974,Joey,2007-05-13 03:08:00,9122,"Thank you Rick  I'll take the slow down, to get rid of the slow down  Its very frustrating to try to reply to a thread only to retry over 10 times and still not be able to, and the same goes for posting a new thread.  After 10 or so times, I'm not going to waste any more time and then I just don't bother reading or posting, which is bad for business if you know what I mean, because I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Hope it works *fingers crossed*  Joey"
70977,bigfish1965,2007-05-13 03:12:00,3382,"It appears to be a routing problem Joey. We know by the polls that a disproportionate number of those affected were on Rogers cable and Bell Hi-Speed. I think they have a common hub. IF we go to a new server and the issue remains, it will be up to members to call their ISP and complain."
71009,Big Cliff,2007-05-13 10:38:00,6899,"I'm on Bell Dial up and have never had a problem with the board being slow (other than dial up speed), in fact the site loads quicker than many other sites I go to. I guess this is a case of slower is faster."
71011,Shelley Cooper,2007-05-13 11:00:00,394,We're on cable here and haven't had any issues with getting on the site either....
71022,OhioFisherman,2007-05-13 12:08:00,6623,If the server is slow I don`t tip as well.
