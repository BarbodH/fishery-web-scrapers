Emerging green weeds are very late this year, practically no green weeds at all. In some spots we've found some brown, last year leftovers. Water very stained, visibility 18-24"", surface temperature 60Â°F. It does not look good . Anyway we've had about four hrs to try. After couple of hrs, not even a sniff ( deep, shallow, rocks, old weeds, all kinds of different lures ) nothing. Why I call this lake my favored lake? Well I was never scunked there, but it looked that today it is going to happen. Desperate situation require desperate measure  . I have one spot on this lake (last resource spot   ) where with conjunction with one specific lure produced for me every time. And I'm glad to say it did not change today   Nothing big (22-24"") but still a fish        We've lost two more about the same size. ""The skunk""  was delayed, then cancelled alltogether again"
