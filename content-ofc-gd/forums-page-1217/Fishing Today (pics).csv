Went to same spot as last week when i went 3 for 6 but didn't have a camera. this time i had a new camera and wouldn't you have guessed, i went 0 for 5   . Although i did see all fish and 3 were browns and 2 bows. had to use the new camera so here are a few pics of the scenery. I love the pic of the swan in flight. Hope you enjoy.          bbnotty"
