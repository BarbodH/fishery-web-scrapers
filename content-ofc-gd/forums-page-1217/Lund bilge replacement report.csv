71068,Guest lundboy,2007-05-13 14:38:00,0,"Just thought I give you Lund owners a heads up on replacing a Bilge pump in a 2000 era Lund.  You might want to check the state of your bilge pumps.  I started out thinking that I would replace the factory bilge pump in my 2000 Mr. Pike with an automatic 750GPH after seeing the new Tundra that sank.  The hose connector is 3/4"" btw.  So I unscrew the 8"" access cover in the splashwell and locate the pump, grab hold of the top of it and it falls off!  I didn't even twist it!  Come on Lund!   I would expect better than this!  Hmmm...  then I look closer.  The (supposed to be detachable) base is pop riveted to a bent aluminum plate scrap that is attached to a stringer by 2 more rivets.  The whole plate kind of ""hovers"" off the hull plate by about 1/8"" and is acting like a spring.... YUK.  Obviously this plate (and the pump) has been bouncing off of the hull plate all these years and did a number on the original pump, cracking the case and the plastic tabs that held it to it's base.  -First thing I had to do is get a drill into that 8"" access hole and drill out the rivets on the stringer. Easier said than done in the dark with one hand. -Removed the plate.  Drilled out rivets holding old pump base to plate. -Checked placement for new pump (Rule-Mate 750) and marked it's base mounting holes. -Drilled new holes in plate -Drove to CTC (on a Saturday, it was like a mad house) for a pop rivet tool (which I already had one at home 30Km away, I was at a friends house) and some 3/16""x1/4"" rivets and a new 3/4"" hose clamp -Riveted the base down to the plate -Glued a 1/4"" thick 5""x5"" piece of rubber tire under the plate (for a little more support)  -Here's the tricky part... riveting the plate back on the stringer.  I couldn't squeeze the rivet tool handles with one hand through the hole! Solution...  Use short a 2x4 placed on the inside bottom of the hull, and rest the lower handle of the rivet tool on the 2x4 and push down on the upper handle. -Cut wires to length on the new pump and crimp new spade lugs on the brown and black wires -Hook up hose using new clamp -Snap pump onto base -Hook up to existing wires -Put some water in the bilge to test -Turn on power -Done  Later on I will attempt fish a 2 conductor wire up to the console fuse panel (there's a wiring conduit right by the pump) so that I can hookup the third wire from the pump for a manual override.   I ordered a new SPDT (3 position) lighted Contura switch from Westmarine to replace the existing SPST.  All in all it took 2.5 hrs. (not count trip to CTC)  I thought it might be about 1 hr."
71086,bucktail,2007-05-13 15:34:00,1857,Thanks for the heads up. Good to know what I will get into when the time comes!
71146,Billy Bob,2007-05-13 19:34:00,5865,Sounds like you did a nice job. Every spring I expect I'll have to replace my bilge or live well pump on my 1985 Grumman. But knock on wood it just keeps on tick-en. Last year I did replace the on/off switch on the live well with a timer switch. Should of done that YEARS ago.  Bob
