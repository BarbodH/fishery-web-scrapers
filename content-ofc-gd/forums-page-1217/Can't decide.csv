We were going to go tot he Goulias river but I have found out from alot of the board memebers that most of the land on the Goulias river is private and is a no camp zone. We have heard there is some good shore pike fishing in Timmins so maybe we'll head up there instead. It's going to be along trip coming from the Hammer so I want to make the drive worth the while. Just deciding on where to go now Sault ste Marie or Timmins, any suggestions?"
