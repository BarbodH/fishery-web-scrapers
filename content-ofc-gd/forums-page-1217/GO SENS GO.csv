70998,Badger Shark,2007-05-13 07:56:00,291,"Hey Matt, it really does look like they FINALLY have become a team with confidence.  When Buffalo scored that tying goal with 5 sec. left, I thought there was no way they would win and would fold like a cheap tent but after watching the highlights they really seemed composed and not worried.  And on another note, have you been out yet?  I havent been able to get out because of vehicle issues but I am heading up to Crotch lake for the May long weekend and finally will be out.  We should get out some time again and this time I will be ready when that rod goes off with a ski on."

71216,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-14 00:04:00,0,The scary part is that they seem to be getting better every single game out.  The sad thing about this is we may only have 6 hockey games  left.  No way Detroit or even Anaheim can even come close to putting up a fight.  Go Sens Go
