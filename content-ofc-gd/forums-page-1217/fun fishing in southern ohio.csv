71280,oxcowboy,2007-05-14 02:35:00,544,"hey folks just thought i would share a few pics from the last 2 times i have had a chance to do a little fishing.  the best thing is i have had a chance to do it with my stepson ethan.  he is becoming quite the little angler at 5 years old.  the first pic is of a small mouth we got out of one of our farm ponds, there are only a couple of them in there, but seem to be doing pretty good, i guess it around 2.5 lbs   the next picture is of a blue cat.  this is the best one i have caught this year, but i hope to improve some as i get to do more fishing once school is out.  it weighed about 15 lbs.  ethan went wild when he saw it, he said ""  Thats the biggest fish i NEVER SAW.  Ethan managed to catch several bluegills and a nice little largemouth that evening.  The next time i got out was to a little creek that feeds into the ohio river.  all together i landed 13 fish 8 flat head catfish , 2 drum a smallmouth, a sucker  , and a nice little sauger  ( closest thing to a walleye i can get without heading north).  no real size yet, but im hoping to do a little better down the road, sure was alot of fun catching them all though.  hope i havent bored ya'll to death.  good luck out on the water.  jason"
