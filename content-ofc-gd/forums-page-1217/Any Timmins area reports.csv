Does any one have a link to the Ontario fire report web sites that will give up to date info? Also how has the weather been lately? Are the bugs out heavy yet? Thanks in advance.

May 9, 2007  PROVINCE EXPANDS RESTRICTED FIRE ZONE TO NORTHEASTERN ONTARIO News Release SUDBURY â€• The Ministry of Natural Resources is expanding the Restricted Fire Zone already in place for Northwestern Ontario to include Northeastern Ontario.  Implementation of a Restricted Fire Zone is aimed at reducing the number of human-caused wildfires, especially brush and grass fires that are threatening people and property.  The fire hazard is extreme because of prolonged dry conditions and strong winds.  Effective at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, May 10, 2007 until further notice, all open burning is banned outdoors.  The restrictions apply to the Ministry of Natural Resources districts of Hearst, Kapuskasing, Cochrane, Timmins, Wawa, Chapleau, Kirkland Lake, Sudbury, North Bay, Sault Ste Marie and Manitoulin Island.  The exception is the far north and south of the French River  A Restricted Fire Zone remains in place in Northwestern Ontario in the districts of Red Lake, Kenora, Fort Frances, Dryden, Sioux Lookout, Thunder Bay and Nipigon. The exception is the far north and the northern part of Nipigon District.  Please contact your local ministry office to see if your area is affected.  Under the Restricted Fire Zone regulations, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited.  Campfires may be allowed at some organized campgrounds or parks that use approved fire pits and meet certain other criteria.  Campers should check with the owners or operators first.  Within the Restricted Fire Zone area, people can still use portable gas stoves for cooking and warmth but the public is asked to use extreme caution.  Ministry fire staff and conservation officers will strictly enforce the ban on open burning.  Note: Please see attached map for Restricted Fire Zone areas.  Covers everything from the south side of Nipissing all the way North to Kesagami Lake."
