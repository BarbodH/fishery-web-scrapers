Went home changed, grabbed the gear, had a bite to eat and by 5:30 i was at my spot to try for those colourful little guys. We are blessed here in Ontario to be able to catch these decent native fish a half hour drive from the downtown of the largest city in Canada. Half of my casts ended up stuck on a branch or twig which made things a tough go at times.  But there was some nice brook trout to be found in this snarled area where few go.  Sometimes you would stumble upon a nice clear patch of creek which provided relief from tripping and hacking through the fallen trees and streamside foliage.  Caught a half dozen of these before the sun started to disappear.   All in all a fine end to the day.  ehg"
