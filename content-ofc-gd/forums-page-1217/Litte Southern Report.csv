71123,mattyk,2007-05-13 18:35:00,2110,"Had a chance to go out today and fish the falls of the Ohio river in here in Louisville. The river was finally low enough to fish. You can catch pretty much anything in this river including: walleye, sauger, white bass, stripers, hybrid bass, smallmouth, largemouth, paddle fish, carp, gar, etc.  Today i fished for a two hours using Jigs and small crank baits. I was able to catch a few small saugers, a few white bass, two drums, a few shad and a new species i have never caught before a small flat head catfish. Now im just looking forward to coming up to ontario to fish for some muskies soon.  Falls of the Ohio River  Falls of the Ohio River  Small Flat Head  Small sauger  White bass "
