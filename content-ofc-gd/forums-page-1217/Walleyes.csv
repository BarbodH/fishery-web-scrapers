70720,Coach B,2007-05-12 02:00:00,18,Gang- Hitting the Manion Lake system in two weeks (just north of Mine Centre.) Any word on what's working or if they're running yet?  This is an hour north of International Falls for another location reference. We've worked a lot of spinner rigs in the past but is always a crap shoot on the color.

70828,rickster,2007-05-12 15:18:00,495,Welcome Coach B I fish the area quite a bit.  Not manion so much but I do fish the waters around Mine Centre alot as my wifes parents live there.  Late ice out this year but jigs tipped with minnows or spinners work well all season. Good luck and have fun.  Watch out the woodticks are terrible right now.  I went for a walk into a small lake up there last week.  half mile in and half mile out and I picked of forty two woodticks. onefishing:

I'm hoping that will spark the eye's up when we hit the water on Sunday. Dying to try some new rigs I used in Arkansas last year (38 pound striper on it) and they have caught a bunch of eye's on it this year. Should work well on the Northerns as well.  Bass Assasin 5' shad on a custom weighted weedless hook. I guess we'll see. Probably spend the most time trolling."
