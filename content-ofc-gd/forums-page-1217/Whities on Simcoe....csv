Big Waves and highwinds made it interesting... We finnally got to the spot and took all of 2 mins to get my first whitie of the softwater season.  The rest of the day was like clockwork. Double headers left and right and fish and fish for most of the day until we left around 1ish. Felt like I fishing for 5 lb perch..lol  I took a couple long breaks in between after my elbow felt like it was gonna dislodge from my arm  great feeling !!  We had one of our whities for dinner that night.. Fantastic !! Now i have to find the lakers on simcoe !!   "
71094,iceguy,2007-05-13 15:55:00,341,"Nice cityfisher, Looks like you and your bro are having quite the spring. Any Lakers? Now that the salmon are biting don't think I'll get a chance to get into the whitey's this year.You and Al are invited to saturday in Late may/june in Bomanville for some chrome. Have fun in Jamaica."
71099,Carp,2007-05-13 16:42:00,1488,Nice work on the whities.  It's always a good day when you can get out fishing. The catching part is just a bonus. You ended up with one heck of a bonus on this trip.

71200,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-13 23:13:00,0, Thanks for replying.  40 minutes with a 135hp? It would have took me a few hours with my 40 h.p then!!! Lucky I didn't attemp it!!!
