70872,tomkat,2007-05-12 20:23:00,246,What are your thoughts on the ultimate kawartha muskie rod for all day casting of smaller bucktails crank baits and spinner baits? I want to find the lightest rod possible maybe its not a muskie rod at all but a heavy bass rod? Just looking for some input. My st croix premier musky rods feel like hockey sticks by the end of the day.

A more affordable option would be the MUR965C I think, it's a 6""5"" medium action bucktail rod that you can cast all day long with."
