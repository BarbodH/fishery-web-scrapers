71481,Landlocked,2007-05-14 18:50:00,171,Can anyone tell me how the fishing is in this area?  Thanks!
71514,kuhaman,2007-05-14 19:33:00,503,"Ive fished the area for a long time and the fishing can be from okay to outstanding depending on where you fish. Ive had pretty good luck on Red Cedar for smallies and wallys but my fave lake in the area is Wicksteed. The whole lake is surrounded by crown land and theres only one boat launch and it can be tricky at times. The wally,bass and pike fishing on Wicksteed is just awesome. 2 summers ago I got a 9.5lb wally."
