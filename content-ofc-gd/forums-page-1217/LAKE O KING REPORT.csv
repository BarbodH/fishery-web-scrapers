First off I would like to thank Rob ( iceguy) for putting me on my very first open water king salmon. What a fight....You truely are a king of kings Rob. Alarm went off at 3:30 am and was on the water fishing by 6am. We picked up our first fish a little after 7am. It was good to get the skunk out of the boat early my first open water king . What a treat. A Beautiful 20lb king  About 20 min later Rob hit this nice scrappy 4lb bow  It was nice to bump into a bow right away but Rob diserved a nice king. And he got what he diserved a half hour later A gorgeous 24lb Chinook   We were content after landing those two, well atleast I was  but we were in for a treat. As soon as the lines were back in the water we hit another king. Me with a 23lb king  I was spoiled my very first time out for salmon and i think i will put riggers on my boat soon.lol. But the action wasnt over yet . We couldnt even get all the lines back down and another fish was on. It was a 16lb king and It liked to jump....lol. Rob landed it after a very acrobatic fight. But we were unable to take pics due to my warpo camera. It was a great day on the water and a lot of fun... Thanks rob for gettingme addicted to a new type of fishing . Im sure i will spend a couple Gs on salmon gear this season.....lol . It would be cheaper to have a drug addiction...lol Goodluck on the water"
