335116,Funkeh,2009-04-26 22:30:00,7,"Hey guys, I'm relatively new to fishing but I've been following these boards recently and wanted to get in on the hype around trout opener. I've only ever fished for crappie/sunfish at Simcoe, I've never tried trout before and don't know anyone else who could help me out. Since I had not the slightest clue where the trout hotspots were, I took the advice from others on this board and just started stopping by random rivers/creeks east of Toronto. Spent about 4 hours this morning riverhopping (walking 10 mins up/downstream of wherever I could find parking) starting from 4am (couldn't sleep...meh...). Despite people saying that pretty much any tributary that feeds off Lake Ontario would have trout, I didn't come across a single fishermen, nor did I see any trout.  Just when I was about to give up and call it a day, I remembered a little creek a past co-worker had said sometimes had baby trout. Figured what the hell, give it one last shot, and lo and behold, as soon as I get there water is crystal-clear and there are a bunch of 12-18 inch fish. I was tripping over myself in my excitement to get a worm on the hook and tossed it in. I was using 6lb mono on a 6ft light spinning combo I got for $40 from Wal-Mart (i'm a student, times are tough lol). First cast into the school, bang my reel is screeching. Played that fish real cautious for about 5-6 mins cuz I was scared the line would snap. Finally when I'm about to bring it in, it gives a final head toss 2 feet from me and snaps the line, but not before I had a chance to see the puckered mouth. My (almost) trophy trout turned out to be a sucker!  It made me feel less bad about losing the fish since I woulda tossed it back anyways having heard that suckers/carp/catfish are garbage and not to be eaten. Kept playing that little school for a bit more confirmation, didn't hook any but when a few started running upstream through the shallows they were flipping on their sides and I could see the whole school was just suckers.  I moved further downstream and was actually able to locate about 4 trout between 20-30 inches (one of them was a monster at least 3 feet) hanging out in a logjam just downstream of some rapids. I could clearly see the difference now (there were a few suckers hanging out as well), so I tossed in my worm. Snagged on a branch almost instantly. Kept repeating the same for the next 2 hours, tossing in half of a nightcrawler on a #8 baitholder hook with a single large splitshot 12 inches up, or a 1/16th lead jig tipped with 1 inch yellowtail grubs/pink tubes. Snagged up a good 15-20 times (I swear I spent more time retying hooks than I did fishing...), and the few casts I managed to not snag just flew right by the trout with not the slightest interest shown.  Finally I had to give up when I ran outta hooks/jigheads (goddamned snags). It was pretty frustrating, but on the way back to the car I stopped by the first pool and still saw at least 30-40 good sized suckers just chilling. When I got home I took a quick shower and hopped on the net to do a little more research. Anyways, after lurking for so long I decided to make this post to ask two questions.  First of all, can anyone vouch for the taste and texture/lack thereof of suckers? I'm finding conflicting arguments, majority saying it's a trash fish, but a few say that it is actually quite tasty aside from the annoying bones (faced with a choice between a fish with bones or no fish at all, I'll take the bones...). I'm normally not a fussy eater but the last time I ignored warnings was when I tried cooking a bullhead catfish and the mushiness/taste was horrid, so I'm kinda scared to try another bottom feeder.  Second question: could anyone please PM me and help me find some trout and/or give me tips on how to land the ones I do find? I'm not asking for any personal honey holes, just wanting to know if there are any ""common knowledge"" hotspots near Toronto. I understand that everyone needs to pound the banks and put in their dues to discover some of these places, and honestly I do try, but it gets somewhat discouraging especially with the little free time I have (work and university) to blindly trek for hours without finding anything. I'd really appreciate any tips as well on baits/setups to use, so far I've been relying on worms. I've read through some of the standard setups with shots at certain depths, but things go differently in a real river where the depth varies constantly from 3 feet to 6 inches . i.e. I tried adding shot to keep my worm down but when I'm tryin to cast to the opposite bank (10-15 feet), either my bait will lie flat on the bottom or the current will carry it swiftly back to within 5 feet of my bank. I tried adding a small Thill Balsa float (the round ones not the stick ones) but the current just grabbed it even faster.  Sorry for the long post, but any replies and advice would go miles towards boosting my mood. I would honestly appreciate any help whatsoever, whether it be some tips for trout or good words for suckers. Here's hoping I can have a nice fish dinner before the month is out.  Cheers."
335118,purekgw,2009-04-26 22:42:00,585,you can eat em i have never tried but i hear carp is ok smoked
335129,grt1,2009-04-26 23:27:00,638,"suckers are pretty boney, but up here a lot of people catch them in the spring when they are spawning and can or pickle them. Evidently the pickling processhelps break down the bones and they add red food colouring to it so when it comes out it looks like salmon. the bones end up the way the salmon bones do when you take them out of the can.  I had one lady give me a jar of pickled sucker and the wife made a meat loaf out of it. the first slice was ok but after that it was kindof tough to get down.  maybe it would be good if used as a sandwich meat."
335157,nancur373,2009-04-27 00:15:00,1211,Welcome to the board. My best advice would be to look at google earth for creeks and tribs. Then drive out to the roads that dross them and find the places where people are parked. Then go from there.  Curt
335182,Daplumma,2009-04-27 00:55:00,1961,I hear Pike love them.
335189,Rattletrap2,2009-04-27 01:06:00,1652,"Welcome to the board! I can't really help you with locations East of the city, but the suggestions to look at Google Satellite are probably a good place to start. Sounds like you already found one good spot with some real decent fish in it.  As for techniques, maybe try this. Downsize your line to 4 or 6 lb. and try the Drennan clear plastic floats that attach to your line with small pieces of surgical tubing. Next add several BB2 sized split shot spaced out below the float. Downsize your hook as well to maybe a #10 or #12. I found using the small pink Berkley trout worms work very well. You can easily adjust the float to suit the section of water you are drifting.  There are many good trout fishermen on this board that will most likely be able to teach us both a few things. I'm certainly no expert!  Good luck!"
335294,Funkeh,2009-04-27 03:11:00,7,"Thanks everyone for your responses. I always use Google Maps satellite view to scope out fishing spots and road access, but I'm beginning to wonder if I'm scoping places too far downstream. So far all the tribs I've checked have been east of Toronto and south of the 401, but I've not come across a single angler. Yet I've been reading reports of people fishing around (north?) of the CNR railroad, maybe that's why I'm not finding anyone, are the majority of trout further upstream at this point?  Also thanks Rattletrap2 for your tips on setup, I'll try to get a Drennan float tomorrow from a local bait shop since I don't think I've seen them at Wal-Mart or Canadian Tire. I'm assuming the Drennan Piker is the float to use for rivers? Just not sure of size, I think I'll go for the number 2 to be safe. In light of the fact I've been using live 4-6 inch nightcrawlers (I pinch em in half and hook em 3 times through a baitholder hook), would you still suggest Berkeley Trout worms? I'm generally biased towards using live baits whenever I'm fishing but if Berkeley's outperforms live I'll make the switch. I've also come across suggestions for roe bags with red octopus hooks, is anyone finding them to be more productive?  Right now I'm using South Bend brand (Wal-Mart) 6lb mono. Should I pony up the cash for a better fluorocarbon line? Also should I bother using swivels/leaders or is just a straight rig with float, 2-3 spaced out split shot, and hook ok?  Lastly, I just wondering what time of day/weather conditions are optimal for trout right now.  ie Pre-dawn vs dusk, sunny vs overcast, warmer vs cooler temps, to go or not to go during/after rains. Since I have very limited opportunities to head out I want to make sure I optimize my chances by not going when all the signs point to a sluggish day.  Sorry for the plethora of questions, I've just gotten caught up in the whole trout fever and the more reports and pics I see from others the more anxious I am to learn everything I need to land my first one! Thanks in advance for any and all advice.  Cheers."
335303,xeon,2009-04-27 03:35:00,350,"If your 6lb line broke on a 10'' sucker, you sir, bought garbage line. I've taken 30'' pike this winter on 4lb, no leader. Buy some Trilene smooth casting or extra tuff, both good lines. Also, go to a local tackle/bait shop and just ask them what rivers have fish in them around the area. Also, try checking the regs for your area and look at the creeks and rivers that have fishing sancutaries on them in the spring(your first clue theres fish in it) then look at creeks around the area. Also, not just any trib will have trout in them, and the ones that do and are well known are packed to the brim with people. Thats why that creek you were at where you saw those big guys would probably be the place to go (but check the regs it might be a sanctuary).  Things youll need for a basic setup: Roe bags or Yarn balls Leader Line (4-6lb depending how you have your drag set) Small swivels to connect your main line to your leader small split shot or pencil weights this is helpful  http://www.raventackle.com/Shotting%20Patterns.pdf floats (scroll down to the bottom of the page to get an idea of what kind you need) http://www.centerpinangling.com/floats.html waiders/rubber boots camera a buddy who knows what theyre doing  Good luck and keep reading the posts. Question for you: Do you like any of the fish (except the salmon) in the blue Highliner boxes at the grocery store? All bottom feeders, enjoy. Id be concerned about higher Mercury levels and such in the fish. And personally, you couldnt pay me enough to eat a big trout out of Lk Ontario."
335311,Musky or Specks,2009-04-27 04:03:00,2710,"Yup a buddy of mine nets em by the hundreds and pickles them in the spring(white sucker) Ive had it, it pretty much taste like canned salmon or tuna."
335318,Rattletrap2,2009-04-27 04:34:00,1652,"Funkeh, Sorry, I should have been more specific. I was talking about the small Drennan ""Loafer"" style float. The little Berkley trout worms ( in PINK) should be threaded once through the nose about a 1/4 inch into the worm and then leave your hook point exposed. Small tiny swivels are good if you want to attach a fluorocarbon leader to your main line. 6 lb main line should be okay if you drop to a 4lb leader. Perhaps your line is of poor quality or has been stored wrong? It should not break that easily. I tie my hooks on with a ""Trilene knot"". I think the baitholder style hook you are using may be too big. i would never have believed these artificial worms could be as good or better than live worms, but they are. Even the little chub go for them."
335338,wolfmachine,2009-04-27 10:48:00,89,LOL @ POOR MANS TROUT AHAHAH
335368,dks,2009-04-27 12:16:00,36,"Although I've fished for years, there been several species of fish that I have never eaten. I rarely keep any steelhead or bass for example. This year I decided to try suckers. Felt like eating some fish, so first I checked with the Guide for eating Ontario Sportfish and looked up where suckers were safe to eat. Lake Simcoe here I come.  I caught 3 suckers and tried some pan fried and smoked the rest. First off, the flesh is firm and flaky and very mild. I would say it's the least ""fishy"" taste fish I've every had compared to whitefish and perch etc.  I was impressed with the taste, but, it is one boney fish. I've read you can score the flesh and deep fry it, but, I didn't try it that way.  My smoked fish from a taste perspective was the best I've done comparing it to salmon and lake trout that I've done. But, again very boney!  So as far as I've concerned, good eating if you can handle the bones!"
335389,cambo,2009-04-27 13:27:00,62,"I've tried sucker once when I was a kid, wasn't bad or anything but it was very boney. My dad wanted nothing to do with it because he practically lived off canned sucker when times were tight while growing up. They are fun to catch spent many days with my brother fishing them out off our creek that ran through the property."
335510,fishing,2009-04-27 19:21:00,167,Very Nice try!
335695,Funkeh,2009-04-28 02:07:00,7,"Thanks guys for all the great tips guys. I think I'll keep trying for the trout for now, but if I get skunked at least I'll have a chance to try and bring home some suckers and see for myself just how bony they are"
335706,fishboy,2009-04-28 02:38:00,550,hmmmm...sucker sandwiches-I'll pass thanks
