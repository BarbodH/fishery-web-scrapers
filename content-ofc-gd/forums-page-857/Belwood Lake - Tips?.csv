334133,Cookslav,2009-04-23 23:43:00,1457,"Have fun...Its a Zoo  Lotta weekend warriors out there zipping up and down the lake with no concern for their wake. Last year there were a few threads about canoes, and small boats almost being swamped.... I almost got into a bit of a situation with some goons... I was Drifting along the inside of the island in a very obvious path when this  litteraly Flys by me with in 10-12' and stops maybe 30' in front of us and procceeds to drop anchor, and start casting...he didnt like it much when I adjusted my drift to go ""between"" him and his ""magic"" casting spot. Nothing a few hand gestures could't work out....  I used to enter years ago, then stopped because it litteraly is a Zoo out there, then I gave it a whirl last year...never again. Nothing against the tourney, but that shoulder to shoulder competetive stuff is not for me.  Just be carefull out there because there are MANY who are not."
334309,davew3,2009-04-24 13:03:00,430,BIG crankbaits or Big spinners trolled in front of the dam. 20 t0 40 ft depth  Or further up the lake in front of the bays on the right side. Good luck.
