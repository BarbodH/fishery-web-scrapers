Are you able to get out at all?  Jacques

It snowed yesterday...and keeps etting below zerto at night despite being an average 9 degrees C during the days.....might get out next week...might have to go and find a puddle somewhere tomorrow and cast out....i'm beginning to shake violently from fishing withdrawals....lol
