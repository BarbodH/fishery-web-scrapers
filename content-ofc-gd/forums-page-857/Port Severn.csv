335608,tizfun,2009-04-27 22:50:00,292,"Thinking of heading into Port Severn this weekend for some Pike..  2 Cousins will be in town, one from Arizona and the other from Michigan.. We will launch from Muskies Bay Resort (just off highway 69) and head out from there..  Now, my question is. Should we look for shallow weedy back bays or do you think they will be out into some deeper water ??  Thinking of using some dead baits or live sucker minnows, not sure ??  Casting will be the norm, but I was thinking (bait) as I want to get these guys on at least one fish..  Has anyone fished this area on opening weekend or there abouts ??  I've been here before, but not until late summer..  Any tips would be of great help and very appreciated..  Tiz"
