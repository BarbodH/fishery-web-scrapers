333055,Dozer,2009-04-21 15:35:00,896,"Heading up highway 400 around Parry Sound this weekend and wanna know what the conditions of the water is, I hope there isn't any ice up there.  Anyone have any information for me as to what to fish for at this time of year?  I'm no good with Canadian Sheild lakes...  Thanks for the tips"
333061,fishforfun,2009-04-21 15:43:00,105,I was talking to a friend who lives in Humphrey last night theres still some ice but the lakes are opening. Check your regs lakers may be the only fish open til the first weekend of May.
333079,Rizzo,2009-04-21 16:33:00,4754,"Our lake is about 1 km from Horseshoe and it is still ice covered. Having said that, we are always one of the last (if not the last) to open up"
333099,Dozer,2009-04-21 17:34:00,896,"Well, I'll still bring my gear.  We do have access to a canoe, I'm sure some water will be open somewhere... makes for an adventure  Thanks for the input guys"
333100,Dozer,2009-04-21 17:36:00,896,"Oh yas, and if I'm targeting lakers, what should I be doing and what depths should I be fishing?  Never fished for 'em before."
333115,Cast-Away,2009-04-21 18:19:00,790,"Rizzo, what lake are you on? Is it BWF, LWF or Clear?"
333147,Rizzo,2009-04-21 21:08:00,4754,"none of the above,although I do know those lakes. We are on ""Windfall"""
333294,Baptiste,2009-04-22 01:42:00,37,"Hi Guys, I don't want to hijack this thread but I'm curious about the fishing on Horseshoe. I have property that I've never used and I'm thinking of keeping a small boat there this summer. Just curious because nobody knows much about the lake. Thanks in advance for any info."
334363,Remo,2009-04-24 14:58:00,33,"Horseshoe does have Lakers but they are far and few between, there may also be special regs regarding Lake Trout, not sure though. Like most lakes in that area its a good pike and smallie lake...they have stocked catchable rainbows in Horseshoe but I dont think they faired to well, may explain why the pike are so healthy though."
334586,Rizzo,2009-04-25 02:39:00,4754,agree with remo...pretty much pike and smallies in the summer. Some of the pike are a good size
335909,Baptiste,2009-04-28 16:51:00,37,"Thanks for the info guys, it's only an hour away from home so I'd like to get up there with my young boys. I'm not much of a fisherman so we'll putter around and drown some worms and maybe get lucky."
336085,Dozer,2009-04-28 22:17:00,896,"Got back, the ice was out ( thankfully )... tried jigging deep spots of the lake ( deepest being 65 feet or so )... only really got to fish for an hour and nothing produced.  Summer time pike is next"
