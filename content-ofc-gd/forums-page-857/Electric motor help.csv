335997,Handlebarz,2009-04-28 19:06:00,3790,Well I am going to get a new bow mount I ldont like cable steer and do like the price on this unit from Cabelas at $709 USD Minn Kota PowerDriveâ„¢ 80PD V2 Motor   If you know of a store in Canada that is in the ball park I would look there also.   What I need it to do for me  Boat 17.5' starcraft superfisherman I need it to be able to handle the detroit river would this unit be big enough for the river?  What is the best way to hook up the two batteries I have head both sides one in series and the other in paralle which is better?  What about a on board charger I see BPS has a 2 bank on sale for $99 USD that is a 6amp charge.  thanks for the help.
