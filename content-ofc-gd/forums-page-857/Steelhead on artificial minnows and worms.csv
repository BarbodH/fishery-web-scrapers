But please feel free to mention each size you use (bait/hook).  Cheers, from someone that was skunked on opener."

When my buddy fishes with pink trout worms he will go up to size 6 hooks in extreme cases, but generally has 10s and 8s.  Don't know how that compares with others.  Maybe he is wrong but he catches more fish in the river than I do."
