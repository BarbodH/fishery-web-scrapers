I know there is a leak in the front and I have a feeling probably more since we stripped the paint and some bondo off the hull. I ran across this product from Fasco Epoxies (www.fascoepoxies.com) called ..""STEEL FLEX"" Ive read a couple posts on other sites about this stuff and it seems to be the best stuff going.... next to ""Gluvit"". Ive also read lots of guys having better experiences with it as opposed to ""Gluvit"" they have been using it on airboats since 1961 ? haha must be good stuff ! Its 2 parts and you mix together and then roll on bare/clean aluminum, and let it sit. It makes about a 1/8 thick rock hard layer on the bottom of your boat ? I guess the thicker you put it on though, the faster it dries.  I'm 95% sure Im going to get some and give it a go, there is no price on the site but another guy said it was about $100 a gallon...   :wallbash:  Has anyone else heard of this stuff ?? Good or Bad ?!"
