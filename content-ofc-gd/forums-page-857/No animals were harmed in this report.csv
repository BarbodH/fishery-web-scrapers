335579,Big Cliff,2009-04-27 21:50:00,6899,"Got into my blind at 4:45, all was quiet until about 7:00 then I had a hen come out, I saw another bird behind her at the edge of the bush but it went back in. Couldn't tell what it was. the hen stuck around for about 20 minutes or so and got to within about 15 yards of me. She started to wander away so I tried calling, next thing I know there is a shot about 100 yards away from me, one of the other guys shot a nice jake, it was heading in my direction but happened to go past him. That was the end of my morning and excitement, I had to be to work by 8:00.Oh well, there will be more days to hunt."
