335282,Dara,2009-04-27 02:58:00,3052,"What time of year you looking at having this. I say 2 weeks before the wedding. Gives the stories a chance to die off so thats not all that is discussed at the wedding. But if its golf, I guess a week is enough.  Jeez its hard to type wif ur hands in ur pockets...you gotta spend an hour or 2 and the ballet"
335296,xeon,2009-04-27 03:14:00,350,"Well, the studio sucks so rippers being out is a good thing. Well, for you guys anyways, not necesarily your friends fiancee. A Lk Huron or Superior salmon charter would be cool though."
335319,archie_james_c,2009-04-27 04:48:00,618,I agree with the getting drunk in the bush thing...lets do that...wait am I invited?
335371,Headhunter,2009-04-27 12:37:00,5703,"My best man surprised me by arriving at my office, putting a bag over my head (no, not the first time that's happened) and walked me down Bay street to a waiting van. I had no idea what was going on. After a few hours of sitting in a van with a bag over my head, we arrived at Stoney Lake, where he had arranged to have a number of my friends and enemy's waiting in three rented cottages. I recall arriving and leaving... not much else... although, many of my friends harken back to that weekend with a smile... I couldn't even tell you the name of the place! I was a blast! I think! I'm with Daplumma on the ballet thing... I don't wanna see a menu I can't order from! HH"
335425,pike slayer,2009-04-27 14:49:00,1177,"im gonna give a charter place a call and hopefully head out in the morning on superior with just the groomsmen and the 2 fathers. then after arrange a little golf tourny with a bunch of guys then finish off the night with a big bbq bash and get hammered drunk haha. and arch i'll definitly invite you to the bbq bash, the more the merrier! i gotta get together an invite list and start getting a hold of ppl and start getting things together!"
335460,Uncle Buck,2009-04-27 16:42:00,1000,"Go to the strip joint...  We did that for my brother, and for the 10 of us that went that was the best trip there ever...  as for her being pissed off... if he's that scared of her now, what's gonna happen after the wedding? LOL  Seriously though he should lay down the law now, or he's gonna be a ""papuca"" in my language... means slipper=Wife wears the pants... and going and not telling her doesn't count... he's gotta fess up to it before, that shows her who's boss  this is how it should go...  Her: where are you going for bachelor party? Him: to the strip joint Her: No you're not!! Him: I'm not asking for permission, i'm Telling you... Her: I forbid you! Him: Yeah Yeah, file that under ""W"" for whatever Her: If you loved me you wouldn't go... (crying) Him: If you trust me, you shouldn't worry, and if you don't trust me, then why are we getting married? Her: No you're not going, Her: If you go don't come back! Him: Again, I'm not asking for permission, i'm notifying you of what is going to happen  If he folds now, he's just neutered himself for the rest of his life...  he's not even married and he's scared of her already... man how times have changed... Ask yourself this... Would your dad ask your mom if he's ""allowed"" to go...  I only hope that my trip to the ""Jiggly room"" is half as good as my bro's and i'll be a happy man..."
335461,irishfield,2009-04-27 16:44:00,26272,DANG.. now I know what's taking Goran so long to get married!! ! LMAO !!!  ..but ya..what he said ! lol
335464,addy79,2009-04-27 16:52:00,573,"gold fish races...ALL THE WAY  a few feeder fish, a few troughs (like the ones for soaking wallpaper) and your good to go!  good moneymaker too!!"
335490,bigugli,2009-04-27 18:05:00,6138,We have done some terrible things to future husbands at stags. One gag involved a round trip to Sudbury overnight
335501,Viscount,2009-04-27 18:40:00,52, Fish races are great! Eaves trough works too. Whoever finishes dead-last has to eat their goldfish. Or you can buy fish-insurance at the door for $10 to avoid having to man-up if you lose.
335517,Landlocked,2009-04-27 19:39:00,171,"Whatever you do make sure the groom has several changes of clothes you purchase from the Goodwill......the louder and tackier the better, it's all about embarassing the poor fella."
335547,irishfield,2009-04-27 20:30:00,26272, LOL Bigugli... we got all pissed up at the Lee Hotel in Smiths Falls on the Friday night and put the groom on the train (handy.. right across the street) to Thunder Bay with no money in his pocket. Thunder Bay was picked because that was as far as we could get him with all the money we could scratch together and told the conductor to take good care of him. Was hillarious at the time... but wasn't overly funny standin at the front of the church without him the next afternoon.....
335554,huey graphite,2009-04-27 20:43:00,362,"  Have to agree. Couldn't have said it better myself.  First banned from the strippers. Next thing you know.....""I don't want you to go fishing"".  Gotta have the upper-hand in the relationship."
335575,Moosebunk,2009-04-27 21:32:00,3970," Best reply.  No strippers... Geez, I thought you were his best man, not best woman.    Seriously, it always makes for the most fun for the guys for the night.  Beer. Golf.  Beer. BBQ.  Hard Alcohol. Strippers.  Poutine, Tylenol, Chocolate Milk, Gatorade. Crash."
335624,bigugli,2009-04-27 23:41:00,6138,Thursday night doing the Yonge st. strip til last call and dragging the poor fella to the Bay st terminal for the overnight to Sudbury. A return ticket and chump change pinned to his jacket. He got back late the next morning. He got even 2 years later though
335655,Mattones,2009-04-28 00:56:00,587,go to the rippers! Its a guys day/night. Make sure to tell them he is getting married and OHHH MAN he will get attention on stage
335721,fishdawg,2009-04-28 02:55:00,912,my boyz suprised me with a weekend Kawartha houeboat party...  top shelf for sure...
335734,Marty,2009-04-28 03:22:00,873,"Just go with your gut.    My brother got married a couple years ago. I considered every option.   Rather than the traditional bachelor party, I picked up the tab for a 3 day guided muskie trip with Marc Thorpe.    It was unbeliveable.   My dad nailed a 55 and the last day we landed 7 muskies in 6 hours.    I'll never forget it.   The report from that bachelor party is somewhere on this board."
335753,Greencoachdog,2009-04-28 04:05:00,8163,  Wimpy!     Wimpy as well!!!  ... if it aint got boobs... it aint squat!!!!
335761,xeon,2009-04-28 04:23:00,350,You guys have NEVER seen the Sault strippers. They all kinda look like GDC in that one picture where he's holding a striped bass without a shirt on.
335099,pike slayer,2009-04-26 21:45:00,1177,so my buddy is getting married later this summer and im suppose to be the best man. and so that means i gotta put on a bachelor party for him. now i already asked his gf about strippers and me and him would both get killed haha. so that leaves me pretty well out of ideas! i was kinda thinking of putting on a big BBQ at my place with some intense physical drinking and maybe some different games and prizes and such. anyone have any bright ideas for a bachelor party or themes or past experiences. also how close to the wedding should i have it? anything i shouldnt forgot to make it a great party?
335100,GBW,2009-04-26 21:48:00,8460,"Don't do it the weekend of the wedding, you can do it the weekend before. No ""entertainment"" means anything else.  gocarting, shoot pool, poker (the card game ) or even fishing a creek in walking distance at dusk.  Have fun and good luck!"
335104,Dutch,2009-04-26 22:10:00,831,"Golfing has always been a good idea.  Depending on the time of year, maybe a pool party type of thing.  Guitar Hero is always a good idea after a few drinks.  Stay far, far away from the peelers.  Don't even try it."
335122,bassman,2009-04-26 23:03:00,384,Don't ask his girlfriend any more questions.

335148,pike slayer,2009-04-27 00:02:00,1177,"ya golf is a really good idea, a fishing tournament would be amazing but i dont think we could get enough ppl to make it turn out very well, not enough friends that fish or atleast not enough with boats. definitly not going all the way down to lake O. maybe somewhere with a charter closer to the sault"
335149,Marko,2009-04-27 00:02:00,854,"get the strippers anyways, just don't tell your women that you did lol"

335190,cram,2009-04-27 01:07:00,1733,Day out on the water WITH a stripper  serving beers in the boat.  My buddy did it on the golf course (got her to be the caddy).......good times.
335191,Cast-Away,2009-04-27 01:08:00,790,"I was in the wedding party for an old friend back in 1992 who lived in Barrie, and being a bunch of cottage buddies who all boated together as friends, we rented the Saren Dippity paddle boat for an evening booze cruise with some gambling. We had an absolute ball! The only problem was that the cruise ended after 2 hours and we did not know this at the time, so we ended up at the Ripper joint for a few hours. I would have rather had the evening end with a party someone, but it did not pan out that way."
335203,Cudz,2009-04-27 01:23:00,2652,LOL.  Really?  I have never been to one.  How did you shoot?

Golf, fish, go cart, casino, play hockey, football, eat food, drink beer, hang out with friends...ahhhhhhh what else am I missing.  Oh and lets respect the fiances wishes "" no peelers""  you can go shoot some pool too.  Or go sky diving ya that's it.  Ok good luck."
335245,pigeonfisher,2009-04-27 02:24:00,696," I agree.  The last one I ran was out in the french river.  It was 12 folks having a blast with beer, water, rocks and fishing.  Raf joined us that weekend.  It was great.  Certainly better than the rippers.  The stories last on"
