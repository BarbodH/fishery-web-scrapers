I googled the lake for info like spieces, maps, structure, ect and all hits come up for Eagle Lake NW Ontario.  I thought I hit the jackpot when all the big musky pics came up from my search. LOL!  Any general help would be great.  Thanks  Steve."
334934,Paully,2009-04-26 13:14:00,712,Never been there but there's prolly smallies in it.......
335328,singingdog,2009-04-27 09:49:00,1047,Eagle is primarily a lake trout and smallie lake. I don't think you are going to find musky in it. Several lakes downstream of there have good sized musky.
335411,quickme,2009-04-27 14:27:00,261,good lake..  LOTS of smallies there.  I went in august and used lots of cranks and jigs.  Did pretty good.   Mostly rocks and drop offs so you'll have lots of fun!
335505,cityfisher,2009-04-27 19:04:00,959,been there a couple times... decent lake for smallies... early season you might catch lakers cruising up high... later on they will be down deep..
