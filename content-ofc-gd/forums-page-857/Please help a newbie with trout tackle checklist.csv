335694,Funkeh,2009-04-28 02:05:00,7,"Hey guys, I'm a newbie hoping to get in on some of the trout action this year. In my earlier post I'd asked for some tips on on locating/catching trout and whether suckers were edible (lol desperation i know). I've decided however to forego the suckers for now and try to land one of the trout I found in a little remote creek. Thanks to those kind people who replied to my first post and after poring through countless threads and articles, I think I've gotten a pretty good idea of what I need to get started catching trout. I wish I had the chance to observe some pro trout fishermen in action and get a look at their rig, but as I've yet to stumble across a single angler in my treks along the banks of the tribs east of Toronto (got a niggling feeling I'm searching too far downstream).  Anyways, I'm gonna head back to that creek every chance I can get after work this week, and I was hoping you guys could let me know if the tackle I'm aiming for is on the right track (on a bit of a tight budget being a student and all, so unfortunately not much dough to experiment with). Almost forgot to add, the creek I'll be fishing is crystal clear with depths ranging from 3-4 feet (deep pool beneath a log jam where I spotted the trout) to 6 inch shallow rapids. Most of the creek is the in the 1-2 feet range however. So far what I've come up with is:  -Trilene XL Smooth Cast 6lb -Drennan Loafer float (what size?) -Berkley Trout worms (should I get BERKLEY 3‚Äù TROUT WORM or BERKLEY POWER BAIT 4 INCH ""FLOATING"" STEELHEAD WORM? both from http://www.centerpinangling.com/power-bait.html Also does it matter whether it's pink or bubblegum? local tackle shop only has bubblegum but I can travel further if necessary to get the right pink ones) -Size 10-12 baitholder hooks  Should I bother getting some roe and egg hooks as well? The artificial Berkeley Gulp ones I found at Canadian Tire were 6 bucks (only color I could find was orange). Local bait shop had real roe sacks for 5 bucks.  Also do I need to use a fluorocarbon leader with swivel or can I get away with just my main line?  What would be the ideal way to rig this setup to fish the aforementioned pool? It's about 2-4 feet deep underneath a beaver dam/log jam with an overhanging tree. The head of it pool is pretty fast moving water coming off some 1 foot rapids. What I was thinking is 2 feet of line from hook to float with a few BB split shot spaced every 3-4 inches, and worm hooked reverse through the head like this  Lastly, what would be the ideal time of day/weather conditions to try for trout? Pre-dawn/early morning, or late afternoon/evening?  Sorry for the numerous questions, like I said I'm on a budget having to maximize every penny but still hoping to get a chance to enjoy some trout this year. Any and all suggestions or criticisms are welcomed. Thanks in advance.  Cheers."

If I am fishing worms, I never use a float.  Small #10 hook and a small shot, just drop that sucker into the wood!  I also pinch all my barbs, I hope you consider doing the same."
335703,Fudd,2009-04-28 02:33:00,94,"I never go bow fishing without a good selection of spoons and flatfish.. never ever. In my decades of fishing for bows in the stream and rivers across Canada the majority of my fish if not taken on Steel (spoons) have been on a piece of orange sponge and a few drops of oil of Anise. I don't go in for all the power baits etc, although i know they work fine. Wriggles spearmint gum with a drop of anise also works a treat in clearer water. Just cut a circular piece of sponge ( dime- nickel size) apply a drop or 2 of the oil and give it a shot mate. I switch to gum on clear waterways. Never put the gum in your mouth and chew it... just rip off a piece from the stick, roll it into the size of an egg and put it on a single egg hook.  "

335710,splashhopper,2009-04-28 02:42:00,2931,hmmm... interesting pic of the sponge..  I specialize in Epoxy grouting and have been looking at those orange sponges and thinking all along they might work for trout too.  bad news for me...  now i am gonna be dreaming about fishing while I am grouting !  Where would I buy that Anise oil ?  thanks Splashhopper
335712,Fudd,2009-04-28 02:43:00,94, Yes it is old school... but incredibly effective. All the wishy washy stuff around now makes me giggle. People need to learn the fundamentals of what and how makes a fish strike.  Anise can be purchased at grocery stores mate.. and health food stores.
335714,BillM,2009-04-28 02:45:00,17367,Best trout bait out there..........heh    
335717,Fudd,2009-04-28 02:48:00,94,"Yer i used to use marshmallows as well until i found out how it effects trout when they swallow it. Same with corn, i never use the stuff anymore."
335720,splashhopper,2009-04-28 02:55:00,2931," I have tried the ear plugs too.. never get anything on them... must be the old ear wax turning em off  As for the marshmellows... when i have tried them, they seem to melt after a drift or two ?"
335729,Fudd,2009-04-28 03:15:00,94,"What you need to know...  1. Rainbow will continue to feed up to 4-5 days before spawning and resume feeding immediately after 2. Prime spawning temp is 45-50 far 3. If you find bows still on there spawning beds you will be lucky to trigger a strike with bait. Your chances will be greatly increased with spoons and will generate defensive (protecting the bed) strikes. 4. Rainbows enter the river and follow other fish to there spawn grounds, ie.. bow fishing in the fall with sponge or roe can be very effective as they will follow the salmon and browns up for a free feed. 5. Rainbows do not only run the rivers in the spring, know where you fish. Several summer/fall runs also occur. They are smaller runs of fish but are not pressured by anglers. In late fall and early summer a sustained low pressure system or a cold snap can prompt such a mini runs. 6. Don't limit yourself to fishing the river only. If you find a fast flowing river/creek, try the mouth, it has been my experience that you will have large masses of bows and other species here looking for a free feed of eggs."
335766,splashhopper,2009-04-28 04:38:00,2931,"Hey Fudd: Any suggestions on getting the hardware down to the bottom of the river when the water is running fast?  I am tempted to put some lead on the line, but think it will mess with the action of the spoons/ spinners .  Thanks for any input you may have."
335773,xeon,2009-04-28 04:54:00,350,"  3way swivel with a 1-6ft leader attached to a 1-4oz weight, then attach your spoon to a 3-8ft leader and let the current spin it, if its fast enough."
335779,splashhopper,2009-04-28 05:03:00,2931, Thanks Xeon.... will give it a try  hope i don;t create a mess tossing it out there... lol
335780,xeon,2009-04-28 05:14:00,350," Usually you wont, you just have to pick a spoon that is light that will be drifted in the current, which will mean shortening/lengthing the leader lengths to conditions. Then if lure leader is twisted around the weight leader it will all untwist and should run ok. The rigs pretty much a bottom bouncer."
335781,Fudd,2009-04-28 05:17:00,94,"  When the water is fast and i am fishing deep water, ie a bend in the river, i generally switch to flatfish and let the current do most of the work. If i want to use a spoon in fast water i generally look for the eddys on the bends. The spoons i use in the river, i remove the standard trebles and put on siwash hooks to avoid snags. depending on the current you have to read the river, cast above the eddy and let the current take your spoon to the bottom, slowly retrieve through the fast water until you hit the desired area( you will know when your spoon is out of the current). The back draft of the eddy will make your spoon flutter in the current, lift your rod tip up high and then put it down, keep repeating this while your spoon is in the eddy. let the current do most of the work for you. Bows in a fast current are generally just passing threw, they will find shelter to rest and this is the area of the rapids that you want to fish.  Example- If you are fishing a C bend on the river, the outside (fat part) of the river is where it is deepest. This is where most of the current flows and being a deep pocket this is where you would think most of the fish are? Not likely, most of the fish will on the small side of the C out of the main current. The fish on the ""fat side"" of the bend will be just passing threw. Even if it is half the depth it will most likely hold twice the fish in the back water. A bow has a long journey up the streams( especially fast flowing ones) and will make every attempt to conserve energy.  Hope this helps"
335782,splashhopper,2009-04-28 05:27:00,2931,"thanks Fudd... i have been trying to let the current take the spoons down too. Interesting note about the bend in the river,,, i have alsways been fishin gthe depper side of the ""C""... i have the perfect two holes to reverse that ""C"" this weekend( if the rain holds off)..  thanks  again"
335784,Fudd,2009-04-28 05:36:00,94,"Nps mate, also remember to bring other lures besides spoons. The weight of spoons is nice in fast water but you can never go past a flatfish to get your hooks in that exact spot. They are easy to control and the bows love them. Go U20 size and blue silver finish.  I have never come across a better spring bow lure. http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0024185113590a.shtml"
335859,BillM,2009-04-28 14:13:00,17367,Let's leave the fish on the beds alone.  Let them do their thing....
