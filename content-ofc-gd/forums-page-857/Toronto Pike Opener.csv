Any closer launches than the public launch in the beaches?  Im pumped!  Never done much pike fishing on lake O but a buddy of mine has.  Ill be throwing zara spooks, raps, Mepps 3 longs and some swim baits  We will be heading out after work on Sat for a few hours.  Hope the weather co operates."
336172,SBCregal,2009-04-29 01:45:00,688,im pretty sure theres plenty of boating restrictions/regs in the toronto islands area.  i believe you need a harbour license to run any boat around there.  from what i've heard anyways  (also heard if you're out there you'll probably be stopped)
336174,fishingteg,2009-04-29 01:50:00,6,Ive also heard you need a special harbour pass/license to be fishing out in that area.  I believe its like $20 for the day
336236,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-29 04:06:00,270,yea and they have like 2 boats patrolling the waters!
336240,mistaredone,2009-04-29 04:16:00,913,Why the extra resource?
336243,SBCregal,2009-04-29 04:21:00,688,its a pretty busy commercial port. alot of large ships moving around in there.  check here for port authority info
