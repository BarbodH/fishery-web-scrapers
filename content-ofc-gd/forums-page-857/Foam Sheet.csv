335397,ADB,2009-04-27 13:36:00,444,"Good morning everyone -  I'm in the process of putting together a room for all my gear, and one of the last touches I'm still after is a foam/sponge mat or sheet.  Not styrofoam, but that softer stuff that is usually black/grey.  For one of the shelves I've got, I want to nail down a piece of thick foam to place my reels on.  I checked the Michael's website, but the only stuff I found was far too thin.  Does anybody have a beat on where I can locate a nice, thick piece of foam/sponge?  Thanks a lot for any ideas."
335398,RoyL,2009-04-27 13:40:00,26,"Do a Google search for ""foam mattress Toronto"". You can buy regular foam from these places, not just the expensive ""memory foam"".  RoyL"
335912,ADB,2009-04-28 16:54:00,444,"Thanks for the tip.  I was hoping to find some in a smaller quantities, though.  I don't need a bed-sized sheet."
335913,RoyL,2009-04-28 17:02:00,26,Try an upholstery shop. I remember one in downtown Oshawa that would surely have what you need.  RoyL
335916,tinbanger,2009-04-28 17:04:00,1028,"you can buy foam 'squares' for the floor.Look like big jig saw pieces (2'x2')They are apx 1/2"" thick found at Rona ,Home depot etc .  TB"
335921,spooner_jr,2009-04-28 17:13:00,193,"You can buy 3' or 4' sheets of 1/2"" black foam at Home Depot.  I used some for a backboard for darts.  I think I found it in the flooring area, and it wasn't expensive."
335924,smokin joe,2009-04-28 17:17:00,226,How big are your shelves?  I may have some for you.
335949,ketchenany,2009-04-28 17:50:00,3229,"For a project that I did a while back (using a camera case) There was foam inside that was partially cut into small ""squares"" . . . and depending on the shape i needed I would pull out the amount of squares and then rest my object inside the hollowed out portion.  A good camera store will have blocks of this stuff.  If you pm me your home/office e-mail I'll send pictures; a bit big to post and I always have problems anyway."
335959,Fang,2009-04-28 18:03:00,1330,Look in the carpet section in Home Depot or Rona. The sell some decent underpadding that might fit you're needs. It's also a neutral black or brown colour so it won't stand out.
335973,ADB,2009-04-28 18:40:00,444," I'd estimate 3.5 feet long, and 10 inches deep.  Sorry it's not exact, but I'm not at home.    Lol, I've actually got that for the flooring, since the floor is concrete."
335977,smokin joe,2009-04-28 18:49:00,226,"I'll check with our supply person and get back to you on thursday as I'll be in school tommorrow.  We always get supplies packed in foam granted it's not that thick, maybe 1/4 inch but I'll check."
