335939,ld17,2009-04-28 17:35:00,319,Hey guys I'm looking into buying some cleats for my 14' boat.  I'm going to be using the cleats to anchor at times.  Has anyone used the nylon cleats?  How bout the aluminum ones.  I wanted to buy stainless steel but cannot find a narrow enough base to fit on my gunwale.  I would like to know who's used different ones and did they last it terms of strenght or did they break while anchored under a load?  Thanks
335944,Nemo,2009-04-28 17:43:00,727,Depends on the gauge of the rope you will be using and the ability to get a strong connection to fasten to the gunwales. Nylon has worked fine for me. But hey if you have the cash the aluminum is probably stronger.
