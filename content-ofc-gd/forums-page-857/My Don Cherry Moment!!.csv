335571,muskeybugged,2009-04-27 21:24:00,282," http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=26502  A while back Brandon, who takes some wonderful pictures and post them in the photography section. On this occasion he was at a few Windsor Spitfires game of the Ontario Hockey league, and took some great action shots of the team and their new arena.  So I did my little post, and gave a heads up........... ""See you in the playoffs....""  Well sure enough my Brampton Battalion took out Belleville in a hard fought 6 game series to take the Eastern Crown.  Windsor handled London in 5 games to take the Western Conference.  So they will meet for all the marbles!  http://www.ontariohockeyleague.com/spitfir...-series-p128240  My second favorite OHL team ""Whoever is playing London""!  Thanks Windsor, honored to cheer against ya!  OK that's me tooting my horn!!!!!!  Go Troops Go!  Oh and I took in the Crappie opener on Pigeon Lake Saturday......the days best.... No measurement or anything but it sure was yummy!  "

335628,brandon,2009-04-27 23:54:00,857,gonna be a good series.....bummer im not still in windsor to see the games.....regardless it should make for some good OHL hockey
335663,kickingfrog,2009-04-28 01:14:00,8333,Should be a good series. Both teams have some young stars and some strong leaders.  To be a true Cherry moment you'll have to bring it up ever month for the next 30 years because you don't have anything original to say.
