They GRCA just released some of the water from Belwood into the river so it's a pretty rough go. I did however have a nice chat with a CO/GRCA CO, anyway, he was telling me he hit the fergus/elora/belwood area 5 times in the last three days and laid many many tags.....he actually caught someone yesterday at belwood with a stringer of 7 30+ inch pike and a smallie....needless to say all of his stuff was taken and he got a nasty ticket. Anyway, remember guys, when you're at the upper grand, make sure your hooks are barbless and your licence is up to date!  Have a good one!  Dave"
