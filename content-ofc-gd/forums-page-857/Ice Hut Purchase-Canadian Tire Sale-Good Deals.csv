140757,kayak fisher,2007-12-08 21:04:00,66,"Hey everyone,  Just to let you know, Canadian Tire has two and four man Eastman portable ice huts on sale this week. I just picked up a four man for $255, regularly $320.  I was looking around online, and these huts got pretty good reviews compared to others in their price-range, and they are way cheaper than the Clams or Traps.  Now I just have to wait for some ice on Simcoe, or Jan 01 for Scugog!  Also may be of interest to some, I just picked up a creeper for working under the car, regularly $50, and I got it for $10! I think this is only on sale Sat and Sun though.  Cheers,  Alex"
140762,jat,2007-12-08 21:31:00,138,which CT? I did a search on their site and it doesn't say anything about these huts.......
140765,Grimace,2007-12-08 21:35:00,2020,"The Creeper sale ended Friday, I just missed it."
140769,kayak fisher,2007-12-08 21:55:00,66,"It is in a flyer that I received, maybe this is only applicable to the Toronto area.  The creeper is on sale today and tomorrow, and the ice hut is on sale all week.  I purchased both of these at the Leslie/Lakeshore store.  I know that they will ship to a local store, so it might be worth looking into.  Here is the link to the flyer online  http://canadiantire.shoplocal.com/canadian...amp;StartRow=28"
140786,irishfield,2007-12-08 23:36:00,26272,Well I guess that's where all the creepers are... cause the days of christmas coupon was only good for the 5th/6th and 7th.. and they didn't have any at store opening on the 5th in Midland.
140806,Fang,2007-12-09 01:22:00,1330,Keep yer bill and set it up in the back yard a t least 10 times before going fishin. Moose and I bought these last year and poles broke on both of ours first 1-2 trips  Nice hut otherwise and hope Moose and I got the lemons
140830,daisy_girl58,2007-12-09 02:26:00,116,We just bought a Sub Zero 2 person ice hut for 215 yesterday (Friday).....It is really roomy....and extremely dark inside....Could buy for the buck!  Lorissa
140888,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-09 05:21:00,2582,There is a reason they are way cheaper then the clams or traps ! Enjoy your new toy. I wouldn't trade my Fish trap pro for any other 1 man hut.  But the most important thing is getting out. Good luck on the hardwater!!!
140889,Guest skeeter99,2007-12-09 05:36:00,0,junk!!  hope it aint windy out LOL!!!!   you will see!!!
140937,knotaclue,2007-12-09 15:07:00,136,"I’ve owned one for two years, never had a problem! and i use it every weekend .But I guess it’s how you treat your stuff"
140945,kayak fisher,2007-12-09 15:24:00,66," Thanks for the input.  Instead of me waiting to see, how about telling me what the problem with them is in the wind? I would prefer to know that before it is too late to return it. This hut got pretty favourable reviews in general, and I am looking for a hut that will last me several seasons at least.  There is a warning in the instructions about cinching the interior tension straps too tight, as this may damage the poles, and if this is done, Eastman is willing to replace the broken pieces.  This hut also has several external tension straps, which are supposed to hold the hut firmly on the ice in very windy conditions. Is the problem with setup in the wind, or after it has been setup, and fishing in the wind?  Thank you everyone for your responses, it is greatly appreciated.  It is good to get some background information before deciding on a specific product that I will use many, many times!"
140957,kayak fisher,2007-12-09 16:03:00,66,"For anyone else that is interested in this hut, I found some pretty decent reviews on another website.  http://www.outdoorsmenforum.ca/archive/index.php/t-2014.html  It might help if you are thinking about purchasing one....  I am going to set mine up and take it down (10 times) today in the backyard, and I will let you know how it goes!  Cheers"
142298,kayak fisher,2007-12-13 14:48:00,66,"Just thought I would update everyone on my purchase......  The first Ice Cube that I purchased was CRAP.  It setup and down very easily, just as promised, but the stitching was ridiculous and the zipper for the door would not close properly.  Canadian tire exchanged the hut without any problems, and the new hut is PERFECT!  This thing is awesome, it sets up easily and packs away small.  All the stitching is great, and the zipper is perfect.  I cannot believe the quality difference between the first and second. I think that this hut will last me a long, long time."
142310,Rich,2007-12-13 15:34:00,3927,They had them on for less than $200 last year at Wal-Mart. I almost bought one but was advised against it by many people. Looks like I should have just gone with my gut and bought it.
336247,jasica,2009-04-29 06:03:00,1,The Eastman 4 person ice Hut is sold out everywhere according to the fishing hole....I heard Canadian tire had some for more money then everyone else charges......They are the best....love the open floor......
336345,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-29 16:06:00,10439,"  Should have picked it up at the end of season icefishing sale in March, they were even cheaper then. I won't tell you how much because I don't want to dissapoint you.   As for being in the wind. Just anchor one tether before setting it up and then anchor the other three.  It can be difficult to set up the first time or two out. Take time to look and see how it sets up and collapses and you will be fine. It wil take three or four trials before you see exactly how it collapses back down. The poles get broken by trying to force the shelter closed. When you get the hang of it, it will close just like one of those folding camp chairs.  When you put it away leave the windows detached, and place them in the carry bag last. In cold weather they get stiff and if left attached and folded they can break."
