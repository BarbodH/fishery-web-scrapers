373761,Jonny,2009-08-18 14:15:00,1380," I'm gonna have to borrow that one some time.  Nice evening catch, and the one ""parking lot"" picture only shows that you didn't have the time and inclination for pictures when they were biting, which is the ""old-style"" pre-internet way to do it!  I'm sure somebody will figure out soon how to send real-time ""tweets"" (with pictures) from their boat!"

373889,Leecher,2009-08-18 21:33:00,7832,Sweet bunch of eyes Dr. S. That's going to taste great in the frying pan!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
374127,snag,2009-08-19 13:35:00,1932,32 minutes!  Pathetic.  30-31min. is respectable.   Come back and post when you've improved.  Did you use an electric knife to clean or manual?  sweet
374216,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 18:32:00,0,i watched my boss (who used to be a guide) clean all the fish in 15 minutes.  VERY impressive!
374372,Shelley Cooper,2009-08-20 01:41:00,394, I passed one today in that area... just strolling along... lol
374378,Jonny,2009-08-20 01:59:00,1380," I remember seeing a video once of workers in a NFLD fish packing plant filleting cod. They were so fast I could hardly believe my eyes!  Now, I guess, they only fillet seals."
374379,Greencoachdog,2009-08-20 02:00:00,8163,"  Oh hell yeah!!!  ... I'll take those if you don't want to clean them Bubba!!!... that's why we didn't have any ""in the boat"" pics, because we didn't really catch them!!!   ... one or two here, two or three there... next thing yanno, you have a Canadian boat launch mess of fish... unless you post pics of the actual catching!"
374421,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-20 04:28:00,0,"33/12=2.75  so, we caught a fish not even every 3 minutes... and they weren't trophies, just eaters... hardly seems worth photos just to impress some hillbilly...."
372847,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-15 04:23:00,0,"I have the privilege of working in Nipigon for the next week.  At 4, when I'm off the clock, I will try to fish everyday.  Last night, I fished a lower stretch of the Nip. River.  It was fairly slow, one steelie and one small 10"" brookie.  This evening we went to a walleye lake.  After about 20 minutes of fishing we caught our first 'eye.  32 minutes later, all three of us had our limits of small eater 'eyes, with some larger/smaller fish being released in the process.  Can't wait to get out for some big brookies...  Good times.  Here is our feast...   "
372863,BillM,2009-08-15 12:09:00,17367,Nice!   The oldman and I will be making the 15hr trek up to Nipigon tonight

372870,troutologist,2009-08-15 13:28:00,951,Nice haul Luc. I wish I could get out fishing here. I've got the neccessary info yet the presence of polar bears and lack of time prevent it.   You guys in the same area of the river as the last time?
372872,Terry,2009-08-15 13:31:00,14456,nice

372928,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-15 20:03:00,0, Haven't gone to the honey hole on the river as of yet actually.  Just fished some stretches below Alexander and the eyes came from a lake nearby.
372945,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-15 21:40:00,0,"on a semi-related topic, my coworker just took a black bear by bow after only 30 minutes in the tree stand...pics and measurements to follow for those interested!"
372947,Jet,2009-08-15 22:01:00,364,"Dr. Salvelinus,  Where in Nipigon are you staying? I used to live there, haven't been back in over 15 years. I used to fish under the Nipigon bridge all the time as a child.  Thanks for bringing back old memories with your report!"
372949,BillM,2009-08-15 22:04:00,17367, We are roughing it on the lake itself
372950,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-15 22:24:00,0,  I WISH THAT'S WHERE I WAS STAYING!  good luck! Hopefully we'll both have trophy brookies in a few days.
372975,Greencoachdog,2009-08-16 00:17:00,8163,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!!!... all that action and only one pic???  I think y'all found those fish washed up on shore ... or someone else gave them to you because they didn't want to clean them."

Too lazy to take pics during the trip??? = slacktard!!!  The ""one pic wonder"" reports don't impress me... it's a sign of chronic laziness yanno?!!!"
373356,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-17 04:27:00,0,"caught 15 tonight and just for you, i took no pictures. do you ever actually fish or do you just do the whole ""keyboard commando"" thing full time? hehe"
