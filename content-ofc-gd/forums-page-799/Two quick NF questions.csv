373963,Leecher,2009-08-19 00:52:00,7832," Jim for your multi quote question.... here is the answer: When viewing a post, at the bottom right of every reply box there is a MultiQ+ button that is located next to the Quote"" one.... click on it and it will change to MultiQ-  Keep scrolling through the post and for every reply box that you want to select click that button..... then when finished your selection, go to the end of the thread and click reply.... the next screen will have all of the selected quotes that you have selected just like the ones in post  Now for your second question..... I have no idea LOL Hope this helps! Jacques"
