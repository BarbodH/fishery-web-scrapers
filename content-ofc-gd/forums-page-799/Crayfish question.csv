Like, Churchill Park has a stream that runs into the Grand River near Cambridge that is full of crayfish.  Is that considered the same or different water?  Thanks"
374976,purekgw,2009-08-21 19:34:00,585,i would think that would be ok as long as ur not taken them up north and stuff
375006,JohnF,2009-08-21 20:49:00,3494, A CO told me recently that it means you cannot transport crayfish over dry land. I suppose if you trapped 'em in the creek and waded to the Grand you'd legal.  I forgot to ask him how it would be possible to shorefish with live crayfish as bait.  JF
375015,timmeh,2009-08-21 21:00:00,609,I don't have the official answer but the common sense answer would be that if you trap them in one place only use them within that watersystem and only in areas they could have moved to on their own (ie. don't take them above or below dams or other barriers).
375046,aplumma,2009-08-21 22:29:00,6896,Why fish with them when you can eat them?   Art
375074,Garry2Rs,2009-08-21 23:26:00,1425,I would discourage anyone from moving crayfish even a few yards. Native crayfish are being push out by larger more aggressive invasive species. These invaders are better able to fight off feeding fish. That makes them less desirable in the water shed in my book! Why would you want to help the intruders?
