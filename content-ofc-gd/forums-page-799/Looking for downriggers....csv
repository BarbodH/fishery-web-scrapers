I know Scotty is a top brand and Big Jon seems to make quality equipment.  Does anyone have any advice on where to look for a good price (Canadian)?  Also, what brand/model would be a good buy (price & quality)?  Would a used electric Big Jon Sportsman be a smart purchase (wary about the motor)?  Thanks!"
374150,Billy Bob,2009-08-19 14:46:00,5865,I have used several brands and IMHO Cannon are the best in manual and electric.
374157,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-19 15:14:00,10439,  I do like my canon Easy Troll Manuals.  Canon Easy Troll Downriggers     But to tell you the truth I like the Big Jon Captains Paks for electrics with Canon's second.  Big Jon Captains Pak  
374161,Fisherman,2009-08-19 15:36:00,7201,"Scotty made in Canada, good for our business, excellent warranty, my electrics are over 10 years old, never had a problem.  Check CTC and I think W-mart might still carry them at a better price."
374166,Fang,2009-08-19 15:44:00,1330,I own 2 Cannon Marlin electrics and have been soooooo happy with their perfomance. Easy access to parts at Fish307.com. They're over 10 years old and I've only had to replace 1 end roller in all that time. Motors still perfom well after years of abuse with hauling 10 and 12 lb cannonballs. I don't think I've ever owned an 8lber  I've fished regularly over the years on friends boats who have Walkers and Big Jons. Like the Walker but I found a few of the parts a bit plasticy but their motors are really fast and dependable. The only complaint I have on Big Jon's is they discontinued the spring up rod holders and on the 4 ft arms I find them a bit too bouncy in rougher water (just my opinion).  The only one I haven't used at all is the Scotty. Go electric right off the bat. Trust me you'll never want to wind in a 10 lb ball from 100 FOW  Check out the used sites on spoonpullers and check if anybody still has some stuff they're trying to sell. look at page 2 and 3 and contact the seller.  If I was buying again I'd buy cannon's again. They've been very good to me
374167,The Birdfish,2009-08-19 15:45:00,73,"Walker all the way, quality product!! around $500.00 each at Bass Pro.  I have used my Tournament series for years and love them!!!!"
374204,dedaliss,2009-08-19 17:36:00,3,Another vote for Walkers.  Never had a problem in 5 years of hard fishing.  Blew a fuse once which was my own fault.  Bass Pro has new electrics for 300.00 which is great.  Try this forum and others for used.  You can get some pretty good deals if you look for them.  D
374206,Uncle Buck,2009-08-19 17:44:00,1000,"I've got walker electrics and they are great, if i had to do it over again though, it would be scotty electrics...  much more user friendly and a few more features..."
374208,bassassin,2009-08-19 17:52:00,152,Go with Walker they're Canadian!
374209,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-19 17:53:00,0,What ever you do...DO NOT BUY WALKER!!!!......  Vector is a good one as is Scotty which I have. I've had Cannon and had no complaints with them either.
374211,Randy,2009-08-19 17:59:00,115,There's a guy on spoonpullers.com with a pair of Scotty manuals for sale. He's located in Goderich though.
374282,camillj,2009-08-19 22:13:00,1988, Yup Walker for me too ... at least thats what I had on my boat for years without any issues ...
