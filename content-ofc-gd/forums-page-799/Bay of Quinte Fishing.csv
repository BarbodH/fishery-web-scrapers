374629,John,2009-08-20 20:23:00,2956, Just tried it again now and it works fine. Wonder if the site was down off and on for updates?
374635,Roy,2009-08-20 20:34:00,13728," Could be, John. New sites sometimes have tiny glitches to work out. Why even established sites have problems eh? (wink wink, nudge nudge)"
