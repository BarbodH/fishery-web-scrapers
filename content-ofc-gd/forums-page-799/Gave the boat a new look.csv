374846,aplumma,2009-08-21 13:19:00,6896,Rename it bud the renaming myth is from all of the paperwork you have to do if you are a documented vessel....however just to be safe you might want to do the hokkie pookie dance and throw salt over your shoulder 3 times before putting it back in the water.

374938,Leecher,2009-08-21 17:33:00,7832,"Hey Brian.... the rig looks mighty fine How about "" THE MISS FISH "" for a new name??"
374985,Jonny,2009-08-21 19:55:00,1380,"The Royal Navy has a long history. In the Days of Fighting Sail, they renamed a few of their own ships. They captured many enemy vessels - French, Dutch, Spanish. For many they kept the original name (sometimes simply anglicized), for others they changed the name. Browsing the list, which also gives the eventual fate of each ship, I didn't see any pattern of particularly bad luck if the name was changed.  It's an interesting list...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships..._the_Royal_Navy  ""BU"" means ""Broken Up"".  Give 'er a proper christening when you change the name and you should be fine."
375109,Radnine,2009-08-22 00:14:00,1538,"Judging by the drinks and snacks in the picture, I'd say the christening was a given. Not that it's any of our business Jim"
375121,Greencoachdog,2009-08-22 00:44:00,8163,  Yeah!... you'll need a couple rolls of paper towels and 5 gallons of Spic'N Span for a proper cleanup after that!!!... don't ask me how I know that!!!
