374861,Ultyma,2009-08-21 13:40:00,6, Change the subject?  I'm just using the same argument back at you guys.  Are your lives really that dreary that you have to jump on new members backs?
374862,Roy,2009-08-21 13:40:00,13728,"Y'know, it's illegal in several states to have a second person help you breathe."
374872,Cudz,2009-08-21 14:04:00,2652,"Now here is what I would have written. ""I am sorry, I didn't not realize you were only allowed one rod per person.  I am glad you guys told me this.  I won't do that again. Thanks for the insight, I am learning things here already.  I am going to read the Ontario rules and regs and if I don't comletely understand them I will post questions here on OFC.""  If you wrote that, everyone would have been off your back.  Instead you tried to make up some transparent story about other people being with you. Come on, seriously, There are lots of people on this board who were born at night... but not last night."
374873,Ultyma,2009-08-21 14:07:00,6, Transparent story? Lol.  Whatever.  Why don't you go find the people that were down there instead of trying to insult me.

374877,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-21 14:13:00,947,"QUOTE (jmarion @ Aug 20 2009, 10:21 PM) So anyways I waited out the rain until around 7:00pm, and went to Wilkes myself. It was completely empty of people (normally theres 5-10 people on the ledge beside the dam).  I fished for about 20 minutes with a Wally Diver crankbait, and decided to throw my 2nd line in the water with chewed gum on a hook.  I casted it out and set the rod down to continue casting with a rapala minnow shallow diving crankbait.   "
374878,Terry,2009-08-21 14:14:00,14456,"buddy, no one is insulting you no one is giving crap to a new member if it was someone who has been here from the beginning of time, I can assure you they would be even harder on them you made a mistake the second mistake was posting about it now trying to defend yourself makes you look foolish.....  move on and I am sure everyone else will"
374894,TC1OZ,2009-08-21 15:14:00,987,  Maybe you should edit your post to the correct story and apologize.
374902,bigfish1965,2009-08-21 15:41:00,3382,"jmarion-  Let me welcome you to the site. You have to admit that your post made it look like you were fishing two lines. Now, the guys did take it easy on you, trust me. Like another member said, had you been a regular that should have known better, this likely would have been worse...much worse. But because you are new, you got a heavy razzing. I read the post and really tried to see how I could give you the benefit of the doubt..but it was not possible. Now let's say I posted in May about catching in huge bass. And let's say I left out the part that I was using jigs and worms chasing walleye and moved 10 times to get away from the bass...one would easily assume I was targetting the out of season fish....details are important. The MNR reads this site every single day..I promise you that. Not to nail people but to get an idea of whats going on out there. It is a valuable tool for them...like have a few extra field reporters letting them know whats going on. We have been contacted by not only the MNR but by the Coast Guard about some posts that were indicating OBVIOUS AND SERIOUS violations. That certainly is not going to happen in this case..but I am trying to illustrate a point. We cannot make you follow the law, but we can point you in that direction. I do not want to see you not return, but I do hope you learn that what you post will be read. Don't use hyperbolic replies or sarcasm... you either violated the law or you posted poorly...either way learn your lesson and move on. None of us will here are without sin and we will not hold it over your head...unless you come to one of our trips then you will likely get teased about it. All that aside, I will lock this thread down and it will disappear and we will have forgotten about it in a day. for those of us over 40 we will have forgotten about it much sooner than that...lol."
374758,Ultyma,2009-08-21 03:21:00,6,*read in quotes if you want to read Bull of members jumping on new peoples backs*
374766,Lunatic,2009-08-21 03:37:00,536,"must be something about the fishing this year. ive had lots of bad luck,more then usual.  but i use 30lb power pro braid for everything. only lost one lure due to a pike biting through it. was fishing for bass so i wasnt using a leader."
374767,Cudz,2009-08-21 03:38:00,2652,"Hey welcome. Just a heads up.  Pretty sure on the grand you are nly able to fish with one rod at a time. Other than that, I would say go with 10 pound test.  Good for csting and stil strong enough."
374771,Radnine,2009-08-21 03:58:00,1538,It sounds like you can't fish and chew gum at the same time. Have you considered the uncoordinated gits forum? Jim
374773,brifishrgy,2009-08-21 04:02:00,559,8lb test is plenty for the river and on a side note you cant fish with 2 lines at the same time
374804,Greencoachdog,2009-08-21 11:57:00,8163,I suggest you read the Ontario fishing regulations from front to back before you do anymore fishing of any kind!
374815,TC1OZ,2009-08-21 12:15:00,987,He gets a thrill from posting illegal activities on the internet!
374827,pikehunter,2009-08-21 12:39:00,1659," Here we go! Hang onto your seat and enjoy the ride folks, remember no standing, keep your hands and arms in and lets go"
374828,Beans,2009-08-21 12:46:00,3339,Too bad you didn't lose the rod with the gum...would've kept you legal...
374829,bigugli,2009-08-21 12:48:00,6138,"""Sniff"" ""Sniff"".  Gather up the posse boys!  Ah smells a lynchin in the works for this one"
374830,BITEME,2009-08-21 12:49:00,1968, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!! thanks I needed that
374831,Headhunter,2009-08-21 12:52:00,5703,"I'm gonna need to buy some more smokes, sit back and watch this one unfold! HH"
374832,Spiel,2009-08-21 12:52:00,9065,"Trolling on a fishing (mostly fishing) forum, hmmmmm, go figure."
374836,Cudz,2009-08-21 13:02:00,2652,"The first time I read this I could not help but think that this might actually be McGyver.  He could build a bomb with a piece of wood, cigarette butt and a piece of gum.  This could be him."
374839,Roy,2009-08-21 13:05:00,13728,Welcome aboard Jason. Count yourself lucky that this thread wasn't started in February. The suggestion that you read/re-read  the Ontario fishing regulations is a good one.  Bookmark THIS and keep it handy.     What kind of gum were you using?
374844,TC1OZ,2009-08-21 13:18:00,987,DOUBLE-mint gum!  Catch the reference?
374849,Ultyma,2009-08-21 13:21:00,6,"It's not illegal if there are 2 people there with valid licenses, which there was.  Thanks for jumping on my back right away though, I don't think I will be posting here again.  You sure know how to make someone feel welcome."
374852,Headhunter,2009-08-21 13:28:00,5703,"Ok... I got my smokes... what did I miss? Dude, I re-read your original post and no where does it state anything other than ""I"" was fishing... so exactly what should we have assumed... now I have to run out and get a Kreskin hat on to try and figure out what you meant, rather than what you wrote! HH"
374853,Ultyma,2009-08-21 13:31:00,6,"  So when You said  ""I'm' going to get smokes.  Was there noone at the store? on the road? in your city?"
374854,Terry,2009-08-21 13:31:00,14456,"then you would have said the second person with me almost lost the second rod...... if there are 20 people and 20 rods and you are grabbing them all each time a fish hits, then you are fishing with 20 rods and it is illegal  now that you understand the law, I am sure you will obey it and you are more then welcome to stay and post here  people learn a lot here"
374855,Headhunter,2009-08-21 13:33:00,5703, HH
374857,Spiel,2009-08-21 13:34:00,9065,"  My apologies, obviously I missed something?"
374858,Ultyma,2009-08-21 13:36:00,6, Ever hear of a cell phone? How about calling someone to come with you?   Wait a second....  I didn't tell you when I inhaled and exhaled...... HOW AM I STILL ALIVE... WHAT IS GOING ON....
374859,Headhunter,2009-08-21 13:38:00,5703,"I'm so glad we've had this time together.... Just have a laugh and catch some fish Seems they just got hooked up, then they got away... Was I alone or with someone else... I can't recall! HH"
374860,TC1OZ,2009-08-21 13:38:00,987,"  He quoted your post...which said ""myself"" thus indicating you are by YOURSELF!  Nothing in your post states you are fishing with someone else...  Either way, if MNR saw you cast a rod, then pick up another rod and cast...its 100% ILLEGAL!  Know your facts before you try to change the subject and sound really ignorant....."
