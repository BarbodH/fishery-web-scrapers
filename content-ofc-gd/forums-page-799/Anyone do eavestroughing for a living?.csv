We did a quick fix and chipped away at it to save our attic, and alot of them just broke right off, so now that the weather is nice, we'd like to get it fixed properly.  Does anyone do that for a living.  I think we'll need the soffit's done aswell.  If you do this kind of work or know of someone who does, please let me know.  You can PM if you'd prefer.  Thanks alot.  Joey"

374366,tjsa,2009-08-20 01:22:00,1578,"Its not the eavestrough, although it suffers the brunt of it. Its the roof insulation. I am in the same boat with a story and a half. Major icing on the north side, not so much on the south side in winter(the sunny side). Other than completely re-insulating the roof, these work great. I figure my roof is 0.1 R value,   :lol:  :lol:  http://www.canadiantire.ca/search/search_r...408474396672077"
374391,Joey,2009-08-20 02:36:00,9122,"Oh I know the drill Tom.  The problem is we damaged the eaves breaking the ice off of it and now we have very little eaves left and some of the soffit got damaged too.  So we need to replace all the eaves and some soffit. We were just reminded of this fact with all the rain we got lately.  We already tackled the insulation and attic problem and believe me, it was a disaster."
374395,Twocoda,2009-08-20 02:46:00,4130,probably under vented @ the soffit... the insulation isnt supposed to touch the underside of your roof ...this will cause daming on the roof from the heat transfer through the insulation ....check and ensure your moor vents are not collapsed ( or even present depending on the age of your home) if your structure is stick framed (16 inchs between rafters you should have an 8 inch moor vent between every rafter...if your rafters are trusses ( 24 inch centers ) you should have 16 inch moor vents between every truss....if you have an interior cathedral ceiling ..you should have open ventilation through out the entire perimeter of the soffit  Your ceiling should have R 40 Minimum insulation in it ....if you have cellulose.... that translates to 11.5 inches deep or if you have bat insulation 2x R20 bats criss crossed  Assess your R factor for the insulation that is in there .....ensure it is vented properly otherwise new eaves trough is only going to be damaged the way yours is now ...you need to solve the problem of the ice build up before you repair or you will be wasting your money on the new materials   Good Luck

You can go with the cables, make sure you keep the snow away from the downspouts so that they don't freeze up and will drain , but your heating the great outdoors.  If the guy that insulated your house was paid a case of beer chances are the top plate of the wall is exposed, its a common mistake, the best way to fix would be to get a foam insulation contractor in there, those guys know how to fix screw ups.  If you want to get the soffits done they might get at the top plate through the soffit"
374403,POLLIWOGG,2009-08-20 03:20:00,835,"OK insulation is done.  Ask around and get some estimates and references and I guess thats what your doing. Go with 5"" trough.  I did trough for years but now I like to stay on the ground."
