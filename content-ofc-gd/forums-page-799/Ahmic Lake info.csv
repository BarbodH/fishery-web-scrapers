It's a weekend with my wife, but I have been granted fishing priviledges in the mornings (before she wakes up).  Can anyone offer some advice for fishing?  I have a boat, but due to the ""limited"" amount of time fishing, I would prefer to stay relatively close to the resort.  Would love to catch a few walleye....tips, locations, anything would be appreciated.  Thanks."

374176,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-19 16:04:00,2585,im heading there this weekend.  If you want walleye you really have a much better chance of catching them closer to Magnetawan.  They are in the west end of the lake but they spawn in the river and slowly work they way to the west end but majority are caught in the lower basin on the east side of the lake.  Your best bet is to hit the pike and bass hard.  Beaver and Crawford lakes are fun lakes for bass.  Its about a 10 minute boat ride from ahmic lake resort.  40-50 minute boat ride to magnetawan depending on the boat your in.
374267,sneak_e_pete,2009-08-19 21:12:00,540,Thanks for the info.  I'll try drifting some shoals for walleye and the other spots for bass.  Will post how I do.  Thanks!
