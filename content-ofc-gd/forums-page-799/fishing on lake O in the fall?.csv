374777,cram,2009-08-21 04:12:00,1733,Looking at booking a charter with some buddies....how late can you go and still (reasonably) count on getting some fish?  I assume they start to bunch around rivermouths in september??
374787,rhare,2009-08-21 09:11:00,387,Cram  The fishing never really slows down its just changes. When the mature chinooks slow down most of us head out for steelhead and coho's.  so to answer your question you can catch fish in good numbers until the weather gets too bad to fish.  get out there and enjoy it!
