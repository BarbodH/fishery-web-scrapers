374807,Cudz,2009-08-21 12:00:00,2652,I am looking for specific tackle taht is not sold at BPS.  I seem to recall someone saying there is another shop near BPS.  I know about the one on the highway called Fish-Onatio but I think there is another.  If you know the name and location that would be very helpful.  Thanks
