Once very hot, add mushrooms and season with salt. After mushrooms begin to sweat and soften, about 2 minutes, lower heat and add shallots and a couple small knobs of butter. Once mushrooms are tender and shallots are cooked through, transfer to a plate and allow to cool.  Heat vegetable oil on high in a separate, heavy-bottomed pan. Wipe fish with paper towel and season well with salt. Lightly dredge in flour, shaking off excess. When pan is hot, place fillet skin-side (where the skin used to be) down and cook until golden, 2 minutes. Lower heat if necessary to avoid scorching the flour. Flip fish over and add butter. Continue cooking for 3 minute minutes more, basting fish with foaming butter.  When the fish appears tender and flaky, remove it. Continue cooking butter on heat until milk solids begin to brown and it gives off a nutty aroma. Add capers and a squeeze of lemon juice, then remove butter from heat. Taste beurre noisette and adjust seasoning with lemon if necessary.  Place 5 or 6 leaves of lettuce at the base of the plate. Spoon mushrooms around and on the lettuce. Place warm fish on top and drizzle beurre noisette on fish and lettuce. Serve immediately."
