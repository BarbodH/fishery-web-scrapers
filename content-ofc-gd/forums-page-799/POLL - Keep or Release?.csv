374455,Calender Don,2009-08-20 12:41:00,39,"Any Pickeral over 2lbs I release unless slot size like 1 1/4 lbs in Nipissing even on the top end of the slot release big and old girl there the future. Now when it comes to bass ALL bass are release warm or cold water, Pike one 3 lb every 3 yrs I keep if it comes through the ice, the rest go back."
374456,Jonny,2009-08-20 12:43:00,1380," I like a laugh as much as the next guy, but not when there's a barb in it."

374509,Jonny,2009-08-20 15:09:00,1380,"Thanks, HF.  Now here's something really funny... I think they call it seafood way down South... "
374247,Jonny,2009-08-19 19:43:00,1380," Around here it's a pickerel.  But yeah, up around Timmins/Cochrane/Chapleau a six-pounder wouldn't really raise any eyebrows. You'd just say yeah, nice fish, and keep on fishin'."
374248,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-19 19:50:00,10439,  Same goes for Lake Erie.
374253,Dean Ellison,2009-08-19 20:17:00,39,"A trip to Nippising can be a G-note for a week easily. I can see, for that price, wanting to have a shore lunch if that's the only fish you caught. I would let it go, and catch a hundred 6"" perch  ."
374254,Uncle Buck,2009-08-19 20:21:00,1000,break out the oil... she's getting fried!!  Those that have the opportunity to fish frequently would probably let it go... others not so much...
374256,highdrifter,2009-08-19 20:27:00,2534,  JHC you're confrontational.  Are you sitting on a dong or something??!!

374269,johnnyb,2009-08-19 21:29:00,3413,"I voted no, back in the water it goes....the only way I'd keep it was if I really wanted a fish fry and simply could not catch a fish below the slot...even then....I don't know that I would keep it...just don't think it would be worth eating at that size"
374273,Jonny,2009-08-19 21:41:00,1380," Frame of mind, I guess, and each of us is welcome to our own. (I don't mean this disparagingly, please don't take it that way).  I've eaten fillets from a number of 6 to 8 pounders over the years (not all ones that I caught myself) and I tasted nothing but great pickerel. I've never heard complaints from anyone else around the dinner table either.  I wonder what people have to say about 10-20 lb salmon? I've eaten those fresh too, from Superior, (though I canned a couple 30-35 lb) and didn't bat an eye.  I wonder, is part of the prejudice against keeping and eating large pickerel because they are ""natural"" whereas the salmon are considered ""stocked""?"
374276,HTHM,2009-08-19 21:51:00,4082,However one must bear in mind the the square root of 69 is .....8 somthing Fiqured I take this thread even farther south....
374299,camillj,2009-08-19 23:12:00,1988,"  Well, and I speak from experience .. a six pound (legal) Pickeral is EXCELLENT eating .... and I am not ashamed to admit it.  Now ... the second and third one would probably be sent back with all due dispatch to be shared with the next fortunate angler ...."
374302,Twocoda,2009-08-19 23:20:00,4130,i dont give a rats arse if its against the grain of this thread....6 pounds of pickeral would be a treat to my palate since i havent had any in years...so i would eat it ALL and not invite anyone over to join me ...recently during the past derby a guy picked one up trolling back into port and i offered him three salmon for his 5ish pounder...he declined ....
374328,kickingfrog,2009-08-20 00:14:00,8333,"I have and will continue to release all walleye that size and bigger. That does not however, make me better than someone who keeps one. That's my choice, and their's."
374337,danbouck,2009-08-20 00:32:00,4380, My thoughts exactly
374357,Daplumma,2009-08-20 01:08:00,1961,"Been there,caught that and it swam away. Thats just gross"
374369,Greencoachdog,2009-08-20 01:32:00,8163,"I dunno?... a 6 lb. Red Fin or Grass Pickerel would be world records for sure!!!... but I feel sure that I would release them after timely pics were taken to document the moment!  A 6 lb. Chain Pickerel is a trophy fish for anywhere!!!... it would swim free after a pic or 2 as well!!!  Now if you're talking aboot the less educated Canadian term for Walleye as Pickeral, the 6 lber. would swim... I'd rather take my chances on keeping and eating 3 or 4 ""slotties"" than to kill such a magnificent creature!!!   ... but that's just a Retneks POV!!!   btw... I'd just like to add that I love to rape the Canadian resources whenever I get the chance!!!"
374371,Greencoachdog,2009-08-20 01:36:00,8163, a dozen dozen is the grossest of the gross!!!
374377,Jonny,2009-08-20 01:53:00,1380," Pickerel it is, here in the North. You'll just have to learn to live with your frustration.   So you'd rather take illegal fish. Nice.   Taking a fish that you are allowed by the regulations to take doesn't equal ""raping the resource"". You'll have to get used to that idea too.  Your post is quite a 3 in 1 troll."

374394,Jonny,2009-08-20 02:44:00,1380," If I thought you had ""stupid"" names for your local fish down there in Alabama, I wouldn't make a big deal out of it and tell you because:  a )   I wouldn't care enough  b )   It's not polite  So who's ignorant?  We call 'em pickerel. Like I suggested, get over it  "
374401,GBW,2009-08-20 03:14:00,8460,"if I had no others for food, then bonk it, clean it and cook it. IF I had others in the 16"" to 17.5"" range then off it would go. But food is food and it is within my right to keep the ONE. I had one a few weeks ago that was on the 5LB range and I kept it, cooked it and it was great.  I tried to catch others smaller so I could set it free but no such luck and my family wanted to try it (I would have eaten it all if they didn't) so in the pan it went.  Do I regret it, NO.  The MNR had the ntes in the lake 3 times this year on my lake so I don't think I did any damage, did they?"
374442,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-20 11:37:00,1022,  Good on ya
374155,Jonny,2009-08-19 15:02:00,1380,Let's make this very specific...     What do you do?  Your vote is anonymous if you only place a vote and you don't reply with a message.
374156,Fisherman,2009-08-19 15:14:00,7201,"That size fish would be at the very upper limit for me to keep, and only when from clean cold water.  I've caught and kept a couple that were slightly bigger and the quality of meat and taste suffers."

374172,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-19 15:53:00,2585,"yeah i would let a 6 go.  another over 4 goes back in my world.  Although if someone keeps a 6, to me it doesnt matter its just the way i am"
374177,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-19 16:07:00,0,A poll that has nothing to do with all lakes being alike. 1/2 pound....4 pound....10 pound. It'd be Dinner time for sure....
374178,capt bruce,2009-08-19 16:13:00,820,"I agree with Terry , this is going NOWHERE"
374179,Dara,2009-08-19 16:15:00,3052,"It would really depend on if I felt like having fish for dinner. I don't bother freezing fish anymore. PS, most of my fishing is in a no slot size area so I would keep smaller ones"
374189,splashhopper,2009-08-19 16:47:00,2931,  Thanks for sharing.
374198,Headhunter,2009-08-19 17:28:00,5703,"A L. Erie fish hits the pan! Others, it would depend on the body of water. HH"
374205,jediangler,2009-08-19 17:36:00,1923,Back in she goes.  I remember fishing BOQ years ago and seeing the difference in colour of the meat after the fish were bigger than 4lbs.
374212,Jonny,2009-08-19 18:14:00,1380," I'm not sure why you would say that... it's a poll with a plain and simple choice. It's your call to think of it however you like, but it might be interesting to see how the results stack up on a discussion board where there is a large number of pretty dedicated - and informed - fishermen.  This is part of the background (in case you missed it in another thread)...   I've been straightforward in what I think. And I'm not looking for approval (I don't need it), I'm just looking for a sense of what is prevalent, and I thought others might find it of interest too.  So far - 23 release, 16 keep - shows a more even split than I would have thought."
374221,smally21,2009-08-19 18:41:00,993,with my luck - if i caught a 6lb walleye i would probably have a heart attack.
374224,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 18:46:00,0,gross.
374227,Jonny,2009-08-19 18:51:00,1380, As in 144?
374230,keram,2009-08-19 19:00:00,585,I'm just surprised that 6 lb Walleye ( not pickerel) can get so much attention
374232,backbay,2009-08-19 19:08:00,773,"If had already released several legal fish, that probably means I could catch more if I wamted to. I'd release a six pounder every time, but make sure photos were taken first!"

374240,doubleheader,2009-08-19 19:24:00,497,"I vote release just because that's me. On my last trip to the west arm I released 3 fish of around 5 lbs (25"") and one beautifully built heavy 28+"" fish around 8 lbs. I know they may be past their breeding prime, but my hope is some kid gets a chance to catch one of those and it makes his or her vacation. Purely personal choice and I certainly wouldn't criticize another person's decision to keep their catch."
374241,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 19:26:00,0,you don't win friends with salad or math jokes! 
374243,Jonny,2009-08-19 19:36:00,1380," I couldn't figure out what you were saying either.  I was fishing for a definition of GROSS.    12x12 = 144 = a gross.  Boy, I hope I got that right. This is a place where 4x4 seems to = 8."
