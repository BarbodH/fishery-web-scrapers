374463,NAC,2009-08-20 12:52:00,369,"It appears to me that this guy fishing ""solo"" didn't get hung up either, but rather hooked up."
374478,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-20 13:39:00,10439,  Solo you say. How did he get the action shot of himself then?? ?? ??
374488,Fish Farmer,2009-08-20 14:11:00,2234,"Was out yesterday by myself, launched at 50PT 10 miles out 290 FTW. 25 FT. down. lost count on the Rainbows 15 for sure.I think more, had 1 double. Man was I busy. Hard taking pictures by yourself. Biggest was 30"" All fish released     "
374569,CLofchik,2009-08-20 17:14:00,854,Pat is talking about trolling I thinks.  There's been plenty of 2-3yr-old fish stuffing themselves along the south shore all summer.  Small but plentiful.
374593,NAC,2009-08-20 18:14:00,369,"  Some fine looking specimens you caught there Fish Farmer.  That 30"" is a total hog, how'd she fight?"
374881,Fish Farmer,2009-08-21 14:18:00,2234,"I think it was out of the water more than in. Was great. You don't get many days like that. I finally hit one of those days, you should have been here yesterday"
374895,LeXXington,2009-08-21 15:15:00,1928,Great going.. WOW I keep trying to get there yesterday but I always end up tommorow
