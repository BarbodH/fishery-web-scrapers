374825,Cudz,2009-08-21 12:32:00,2652,I didn't realize how serious the storm was yesterday for you guys.  I have to go to the airport this aft and I had planned to take my kids to wonderland today or possibly Chuck e cheese/vaughan mills if it was raining.  My question is:  Is everything open or are there streets closed for cleanup etc?
