I look forward to catching some more of these come September when I hit up Parry Sound again!    Mini-report : I fished a local pond this morning...zero bites/zero fish! I was only out for about 2 hours and I was fishing from shore. I can't wait to get back up north and hopefully get my boat! I got my boaters card today, but I still wont have to register or license my boat!   I can barely contain myself!"
