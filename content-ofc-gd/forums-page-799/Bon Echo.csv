373983,fish-miester,2009-08-19 01:13:00,864,"was wondering the same thing , im heading up there the 24th to the 27th  i know there is largies and smallies, as well as pike, walleye, lake trout, stourgeon and I think whitefish  as for near by lakes.. there are plenty skootamata , sheldrake , the list goes on..  as for techniques.. i have no idea! as i havnt been there in a few years.. so your guess is as good as mine !  hopefully some one on here can point us in the right direction !?"
