Out of curiosity what blog system are you using (Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress?), I like your site's layout. One recommendation I would have is your header ""W3 Fishing Report"" is hard to see, maybe darken the colors or use a different font to make it more apparent. It should be the thing that stands out first, right now its the menu right below it.  Looking forward to see your reports on there."
