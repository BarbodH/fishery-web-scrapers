277,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-16 13:55:00,0,I just printed some of my bookmarked threads from the old site which had some good information on them.  Just a reminder to everyone unless there is a way to save them electronically.

Just remember to make a back up disk incase your computer dies  Maureen"
