37,Terry,2006-11-15 10:50:00,14456,"ok it's early im the morring, but I can't find any buttons in the gallery to make an album or upload any images.. using firefox....... but once I wake up a bit more I might find them"
40,tjsa,2006-11-15 13:06:00,1578,"its in the ""my controls"" area Terry, part way down on the left under Invision Gallery."
41,Terry,2006-11-15 13:17:00,14456,you are correct sir thanks now if I can get it to upload a picture  . . ok got it working..all is well with the world
97,Joey,2006-11-15 21:16:00,9122,"Rick, will all the pics we just loaded to the ""middle"" OFC board be brought here now or do we have to move them before tonight?  Joey"
188,setomonkey,2006-11-16 02:10:00,872,"I'm wondering too if we will be able to ""copy"" the pictures from the 2nd generation OFC photo gallery, or do we need to start uploading again?  Mike"
189,irishfield,2006-11-16 02:15:00,26272,"Mike Joey's talking another board. This is the second rendition of the ""new"" board we've be beta testing. We're one switch ahead of you and Joey loaded some pics on that board.  TJ said he was going to try and get the old gallery open long enough for people to retrieve some pics while he gets the fishing tourney pics."
190,setomonkey,2006-11-16 02:22:00,872," Ah. I'm behind the times... Would be nice to be able to retrieve some of my old photos, though I could probably find them again on my 'puter.  Mike"
