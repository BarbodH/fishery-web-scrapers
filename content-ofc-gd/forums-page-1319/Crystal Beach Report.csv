Smallmouths starting to concentrate and we found fish in the 30-35' depth most co-operative.  Green and brown tubes w 1/2 oz weight and 1 0z jigging spoons(gotta luv the vex) were the ticket. Most fish between 3 and 4.5 lbs, no dukers yesterday tho ( 5 biggest fish for 21.5 lbs bag, great on Rice L, but not for here at this time of year). However, 1 bonus fish was a 15lb MUSKY    on 8 lb line. That was a blast.  Unfortunately i forgot to put the digi in the Skeeter, but when my buddy develops the film on his disposable camera...   Tightlines,  Pokeherman"
