Either way, it appears unlikely he will be coming to any more of our GTG. He told me many times how he enjoyed his visits to Lakair and how he especially liked Leslie's cooking. I think we will likely see a silver lining to this cloud. My hopes are that Heinrich is in a better place....and that his back doesn't act up on him again. You'll likely see some news after I meet with shareholders next week."
