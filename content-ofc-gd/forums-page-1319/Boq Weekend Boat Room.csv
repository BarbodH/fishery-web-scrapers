299,Joey,2006-11-16 14:28:00,9122,Who going this weekend might have an extra seat in their boat for Ladywalleye?  She would love to show up and fish with us and needs to know if there is any extra seats available.  Anyone?  Thanks  Joey

Also, even if you don't get to fish, you'll get to socialize and have a break...well worth it in my mind...better than sitting at home wishing you went...  Maureen"
