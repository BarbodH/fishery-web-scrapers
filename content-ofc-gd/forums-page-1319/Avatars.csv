47,Terry,2006-11-15 15:33:00,14456,"in controls you can link it where it states ""Enter a URL to an online avatar image"" to wherever it is hosted at this time and it should work"
48,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-15 15:40:00,0,I've tried the link thing a few times and it seems to capture it but the display seems to be cutting it off. I think Rick's is doing the same thing.

77,lew,2006-11-15 20:24:00,12767,"I'm having the same problem as Jim with my avatar.  It says they will be automatically resized, but it wouldn't work, so I resized it myself to 121x 90.  My avatar seemed to get posted, but it's only 121 X 1 pixels now, same as Jims."
