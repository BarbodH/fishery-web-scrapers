289,Jacques,2006-11-16 14:20:00,97,Can I have my 59 posts moved over?  That may not sound like a lot but they're important to me
293,misfish,2006-11-16 14:23:00,29133,"Ok Im asking for my post count back,not that big of a deal.LOL"
298,dustink,2006-11-16 14:27:00,526,PM sent Rick....thanks!!  dk
310,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 14:41:00,3382,Can you guys also give us your count that you had on the other site? We'll do the math for ya! Trying to switch back and forth and edit is kinda...well..time consuming. Will try to get to them ASAP.
313,Raf,2006-11-16 14:45:00,3495,Is there no access to SQL on this and the old forum?  Be pretty easy to transfer provided user names are the same.
316,Kawartha Kev,2006-11-16 14:49:00,281,Please transfer my post count from the old board as small as it was at 59 I believe. Thanks Kawartha Kev
319,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 14:52:00,3382,"No access to SQL on old site, Raf. That's one of the big reasons we had to make the switch. We had no db control over there and they had no way of giving us access."
332,Bob,2006-11-16 15:04:00,370,I'd appreciate it if you could transfer my post count (909) Thanks Rick  Bob

403,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 16:59:00,3382, I dunno..prolly the same thing that happened to following a simple request........
415,ehg,2006-11-16 17:11:00,2666,"Finding the new board a little confusing right now.  So instead of PM i'll request my count from old board here.  777 i think it was at.  Thanks,  ehg"
