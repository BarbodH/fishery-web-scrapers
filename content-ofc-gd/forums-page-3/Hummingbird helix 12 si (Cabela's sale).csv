1010455,BassMan11,2017-08-02 13:24:00,583,Have not heard anything from Cabela's since Thursday about the purchase. Technically if I didn't call as far as I know the Unit is still coming. I did some reading about this and found this on their website:  PRICING & SPECIFICATIONS This instance pretty much falls under that blanket category and gets them off the hook for any screw ups on the website. I would say there is 0% anyone gets the Unit for the price it was listed at. I do wonder if there will be any sort of compensation for this screw up. I won't hold my breath though.
1010459,BillM,2017-08-02 14:28:00,17367,"I hope you get it, but the odds are stacked against you (And everyone)"
1010460,Court R,2017-08-02 14:31:00,213,"This was my response from them   Hello    We unfortunately cannot offer this price on this product, we would be able to provide the item at the regular sales price of $2199.99 and include a $50 gift card due to the inconvenience.    We do apologize for the miscommunication"
1010479,grimsbylander,2017-08-02 19:22:00,3016,"This was my response from them   Hello    We unfortunately cannot offer this price on this product, we would be able to provide the item at the regular sales price of $2199.99 and include a $50 gift card due to the inconvenience.    We do apologize for the miscommunication  I'd email them back and tell them you can't afford the unit at that price but you deserve the $50 gift card. You were inconvenienced due to their error regardless of whether you buy the unit or not. They are the reason you don't have the units now, not you."
1010610,BassMan11,2017-08-04 13:39:00,583,So I finally got a call from Cabelas and they apologized profusely for the mix up and are sending me a $50 gift card for their error. Over 70 people ordered the unit and supposedly a handful got the unit at the listed price. Hey i'll take $50 for free any day. Good on Cabelas for at least doing a little something for their customers.
1085081,stratmaster,2023-05-03 12:07:00,3,Hi I'm new here. Anyone ordered a hummingbird combo lately? I am having issues with getting the rebate online. Link has not worked for several weeks. Sent a few emails to them and chatted online but still not working.
1085088,BillM,2023-05-03 17:13:00,17367,What rebate are you referring to?   I'd called Johnson Outdoors directly if I where you.
1085089,stratmaster,2023-05-03 17:34:00,3,Ok I will call. It's the rebate if u buy hummingbird with 360 live so 500 bucks
1085092,BillM,2023-05-03 22:36:00,17367,Yup saw it on the site and the link is definitely dead.  Goodluck!   They should take care of you.
1085093,stratmaster,2023-05-03 22:45:00,3,"Thanks, so I called and got an email address to send it to, all good now"
1009982,Dan668,2017-07-27 10:51:00,1120,"Cabela's.ca has this gen 1 model along with other first generation 12's with steep discounts.  http://www.cabelas.ca/product/84746/humminbird-helix-12-si-gps  Not familiar with the units though, am a Lowrance user. I know that gen 2 with mega imaging is out so alot of places have already cleared out these models. Just passing a potential deal along, could be a price error."
1009983,BassMan11,2017-07-27 11:50:00,583,Ridiculous deal. Looks like a typo when looking at the prices of the other Humminbird Units on sale.
1009990,grimsbylander,2017-07-27 12:57:00,3016,Wow...I'm a Lowrance guy and still might buy one!
1009991,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 13:12:00,937,"I just saw this online and was about to post.  I'm not familiar with the units but looks to be a good price.

1009992,Dan668,2017-07-27 13:16:00,1120,"I considered as well, but I already have two 10's, no space for more lol. Judging by the fact that the SI is the cheapest, it seems like an error."
1009994,Gregoire,2017-07-27 13:20:00,1397,"I tried to buy one, wouldn't go through"
1009995,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 13:24:00,937,The resource you were looking for could not be found or is not available.
1009996,Gregoire,2017-07-27 13:24:00,1397,I'm guessing it was am error. On the phone with customer service now. Website is down
1009997,Gregoire,2017-07-27 13:29:00,1397,Looks like it is sold out
1009998,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 13:32:00,937,I was told the same  
1009999,Gregoire,2017-07-27 13:33:00,1397,"I was told at the call center that I may still be able to get it, they will call or email me if possible. Ridiculous deal. I was looking at getting the 5 G2 SI, and it is $70 less. If I can get this it is like like 3X bigger!!!!"
1010001,AKRISONER,2017-07-27 13:37:00,5558,websites are toast...  those prices make absolutely no sense...the SI is always more than the DI but not here? what the heck?  if they put a Gen 1 12 up with DI for 600 id buy it right now without question. Ive got a 7G2 and it cost me almost that much.
1010002,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 13:38:00,937,Looks like it was pulled from the site
1010003,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 13:40:00,937,I don't even have a boat and was gonna order the SI
1010004,Dan668,2017-07-27 13:45:00,1120,"Damn, hopefully someone is able to get one. Someone could of ordered a mass qty to resell,  could of flagged the item."
1010006,BassMan11,2017-07-27 14:33:00,583,I was able to order 2 this morning (1 for me and 1 for a friend) right after I saw the OP. I don't even need one (Lowrance Gen 2 Touch 12 & 7 on my boat currently). But that price was wrong and I will definitely be able to flip it.
1010009,Gregoire,2017-07-27 14:52:00,1397,I got an email saying they are officially sold out. I wish I had seen that earlier. I'm looking at getting the Helix 5 G2 SI. It costs $680.
1010010,AKRISONER,2017-07-27 14:52:00,5558,"I was able to order 2 this morning (1 for me and 1 for a friend) right after I saw the OP.

But that price was wrong and I will definitely be able to flip it.  i really hope you actually get it and that they dont get placed on back order to never be actually delivered...id make the argument that they should provide a Gen 2 then...  Lucky duck...I woulda bought two myself, one to keep one to sell. Good on ya!"
1010019,BassMan11,2017-07-27 16:00:00,583,So I called the customer service number to make sure my order went through. The gentlemen on the phone informed me that due to an error on the website they will not be filling the order and Cabela's is working on a solution. Um....... can they do that legally? Do they not have to honor their mistake? This should get interesting.
1010023,Dan668,2017-07-27 16:49:00,1120,"Technically no they don't have to honour if I'm not mistaken, unless you reside in Quebec, they have stricter rules."
1010028,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-27 17:27:00,937,Keep us posted
1010029,Bass Tard,2017-07-27 17:52:00,128,"Wow, all this happened while I was sleeping!  There's always someone deal hunting!!"
1010409,PUMP KNOWS,2017-08-01 19:35:00,937,So I called the customer service number to make sure my order went through. The gentlemen on the phone informed me that due to an error on the website they will not be filling the order and Cabela's is working on a solution. Um....... can they do that legally?

1010440,BillM,2017-08-02 02:56:00,17367,"They screwed the price up, no way they're going to honour those crazy prices."
1010450,AKRISONER,2017-08-02 12:43:00,5558,im pretty sure they have to honour their posted price...legally they dont have any option regardless of how bad the screw up is.
