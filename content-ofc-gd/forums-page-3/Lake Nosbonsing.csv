1084956,BillM,2023-04-26 02:16:00,17367,"Hartley Bay is loaded with fish, walleye, pike, bass, crappie etc.   If you're going to spend the time and money, you're fishing blind without knowing what's on the bottom.    Spend the $250 on a Helix 5.    A few years ago we destroyed walleyes on jigging spoons tipped with a bit of worm."
1084957,AKRISONER,2023-04-26 11:03:00,5558,At minimum you should be able to catch a whack load of bass and like on effectively any lake in Ontario that has em.  may just need to adjust your approach dependant on the time of year.
1084969,Rizzo,2023-04-27 13:06:00,4754,"Ouch. Keep at it, try some new things. Sounds like Hartley Bay is a decent spot so maybe you were just there at a bad time or maybe you were using the wrong techniques. There are plenty of good spots within a few hours of Toronto...spots where you can ""limit out"" within an hour or two. Spend some more time on the water and you will find them. Sorry I have not been to Nosbonsing so can't comment on that fishery, but right next door is Nipissing and I have not had problems catching fish when I go there."
1084972,Headhunter,2023-04-27 14:17:00,5703,It's been my experience that fishing lakes that are surrounded by year round cottages/homes are lakes that get hit pretty hard. HH
1084988,CrowMan,2023-04-28 15:50:00,413,"Although just a liitle further afield, two places that have always been good to me are Lac Kipawa (in Quebec, 90 minutes east of North Bay), and the WhalesBack Channel on the north shore of Lake Huron (mouth of the Spanish River, about an hour west of Sudbury). As Headhunter stated, Nosbonsing is basically a suburb of North Bay...gets a lot of pressure."
1084992,Skidoo22,2023-04-28 18:14:00,6,Actually I did have a fishfinder with me.  I wasn't seeing much overall except for in one spot but I guess they weren't biting.
1084993,Skidoo22,2023-04-28 18:16:00,6,Thank you so much for the tips.  I was actually just checking out WhalesBack Channel area the other day on Google Maps
1084994,CrowMan,2023-04-28 18:48:00,413,"We stay at Brennan Harbour (good people), but there's  a couple of other places right at the mouth of the Spanish too. Loads of Smallmouth (and some Largemouth), consistent Walleye and plenty of Pike. There's Musky too, and in September we've even incidentally caught Chinook right in front of the cabins."
1085014,porkpie,2023-04-30 02:35:00,2521,"Nosbonsing is 1/10th the fishery as Nippissing.  Rent a place on Nip, I dare you to get skunked!"
