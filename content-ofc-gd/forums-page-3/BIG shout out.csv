If the world had more gentle giants like this guy, it would be such a better world . BIG CLIFF dropped off a package to my door this past weekend while I was at work. It was more then I thought and very much appreciative for his generosity.Â  I have not tied many buck tails, but these will be getting me on another new path of tieing. Thank you so much SIR. Yer a hell of a great man. Very sorry I could not be there in person to receive them .  "
