1084887,Terry,2023-04-22 01:13:00,14456,"Buy a lithium battery, less then half the weight"
1084888,Fisherman,2023-04-22 01:14:00,7201,"Depends how heavy the battery is, small 2 wheel dolly with larger diameter wheels or the old style military 64 pattern rucksack with the metal shelf to carry gerry cans."

I've done this for a few years now on a 2 portage route. fishing rods in one hand and the trolling motor in the other to a cached boat.. backpack will hold the battery, tackle and a few other light items. Has been way better than carrying any other way."
