1084792,SirCranksalot,2023-04-18 02:25:00,3291,Sorry---I didn't realize you were fishing an area where bass season is open tear round. My apologies 
1084793,CrowMan,2023-04-18 02:45:00,413,"Actually I was fishing in FMZ 20...catch & release for Bass from Jan 1 to May 10. If it wasn't C&R only, I'd post some photos of some absolutely monster Smallies. 5 for 25 isÂ  a regular occurrence in the spring. This past weekend was off the charts.. The east end of FMZ 20 has a combination of probably one of the top 5 Smallmouth fisheries on the planet, along with the best Lake Trout fishing south of Nipigon. Oh...and I forgot, also one of the best trophy Walleye fisheries in the world...and while I'm thinking about it, one of the primo Steelhead rivers in the Great Lakes, just across the border.."
1084797,siwash,2023-04-18 10:08:00,683,I was intending to target lakers in year round Haliburton lakes... many of the lakes there are stocked and open all year!
1084798,BillM,2023-04-18 13:51:00,17367,I've heard stories about those far east end lakers.Â  Â Not many folks out there pressuring them either.
1084907,SirCranksalot,2023-04-22 22:56:00,3291,anybody use these? 
1084908,SirCranksalot,2023-04-22 22:57:00,3291,Or these? 
1084909,CrowMan,2023-04-22 23:21:00,413,*
1084910,CrowMan,2023-04-22 23:22:00,413,"Yeah, mooching cut herring for Salmon in BC."
1084911,CrowMan,2023-04-22 23:27:00,413,"For Salmon trolling, I prefer Dipsy Divers...mainly because they're directional so I can use multiple rods in the spread. Wire line Dipsys with a tinsel fly behind a Spin Doctor...luv those rips ! The Jet Diver, as pictured, seems to have a following on Erie amongst the Walleye guys...often they're dragging a worm harnesses behind it. But to answer your question...neither of those for Lake Trout...I like to keep a minimum of terminal tackle between me and that kind of fish."
1084912,smitty55,2023-04-23 02:21:00,928,"I've used those a lot over the years, I even have an 8oz one. Mostly the 1 and 2oz size. For those not familiar with them your line hooks underneath those clips on the far side and then up under those loops so it can slide along your line. So you had let out as much line as you want then attach the sinker and then lighty pinch your line in that ring loop to hold it in place. When you have a fish on once the sinker hits your rod tip the line pops out of the pinch and slides down to your lure, or you or preferably a buddy could remove it manually but for that period of time your rod isn't in play to fight the fish so that can be touchy. Just have to make sure your line is heavy enough that it doesn't get damaged by the pinch. They work quite well for their intended use."
1084913,smitty55,2023-04-23 02:47:00,928,"I'm talking inland lakes in Ontario and Quebec for Greys, I've used those slip weight sinkers for Lakers to get a spoon down earlier in the season and also the 1oz later in the summer with small gang trolls for Rainbows and Specks in back lakes. The best thing to do is actually remove them but after losing a nice Speck while buddy fiddled with it I said never again. So I'm curious as to how they were used when you were Salmon fishing in BC. Did they just let them slide?"
1084918,CrowMan,2023-04-23 13:36:00,413,"With a mooching presentation, once the fish hit we just let them slide. Considering these were Chinooks that were 25lb + it really didn't interfere with the fight. The ones we used at lodges on the west coast were 4 to 6 oz...although they did have 16oz versions for bottom fishing Halibut and Lingcod. The problem with the Gibbs sliders (as pictured) is they are little fiddly to unclip...you certainly can't do it single-handed. That's why I prefer the snap weights for Trout and Walleyes...the clothespin style release is as quick and easy as can be to release. Also the rubber pads protect the line better....those Gibbs weights not so much, but out west we're using 20lb mono mainline so doesn't matter as much. Bottom line is...with "" middleweight"" fighters like Trout and Walleye, I want the weight off the line asap, so I can enjoy the battle to its full potential. For that reason, I'll stick with snap weights for freshwater fishing...I don't see any advantage to the Gibbs slider."
1084936,SirCranksalot,2023-04-24 20:51:00,3291,I'm not sure if I am reading this right. I have only tried mine once or twice and did not get a hit. My understanding of the 'proper' way of using them(if there is such a thing as 'proper') was to attach them a short dist from the bait---maybe 5-10 ft?----and that when you did a vigorous hook set they would slide down the line. I may well be wrong on that
1084939,smitty55,2023-04-25 03:29:00,928,"You can put the sinker as far away from the lure/bait as you want. So lets say you let out 50ft of line and then attach it making sure the pinch loop is facing the rod. That way when it reaches the rod tip you can give it a quick tug with your hand to release the line from the pinch and it will free slide down. In a way it's kind of similar to how they use lead core spliced in between your main line and a leader for depth control or as CM mentioned using snap weights. As you said there may be no proper way, you could reverse the weight and then hope the fish strike is hard enough to release the line but then that loop would slide into your line tie. Speaking of which, a bead would be a good idea to protect the knot too. I saw one site that used them for bottom fishing, while another site called them a poor mans downrigger. Go figure. I saw one site that only used a 2-4' length of heavy line just ahead of the flasher. Perhaps CrowMan can elaborate as to exactly how they used them for mooching when he was out. From what I thought they use a long rod and line counter reel and mono to a bead chain keel sinker and a 5' to 8' leader with a 2 hook system to hook an angled cut bait so that it spins rapidly. I also saw one setup that used a similar bead chain and bead with a keel type sinker but it was a slider with a teflon tube attached. Cheers"
1084563,siwash,2023-04-07 11:49:00,683,"Hey folks,  It's getting close to ice out time! Â I am planning to hit up a stocked lake for lakers once waters open up. Â It's a year round open lake. Â What depths/locations/strategies do you find successful? In past years, I've used flutter spoons like Williams or Blue Fox and either flatlined with a bit of weight or used lead core... but moved away from lead.. don't care for the heavy gear.. Â I did recently buy a clamp on downrigger so I might try that... maybe set it higher up in the column. Â What depths/locations work for you in late April/early May?  Thanks and Happy Easter!!"
1084565,BITEME,2023-04-07 12:08:00,1968,Best advice I can give you   from what I read you must have a boat put in at fifty point get out about 300 or 400 feet off shore drop your lines and troll towards Niagara Falls stay in 30 or 40 feet of water or go out a little deeper look for hooks on the bottom stop and drop big white rubber jigs on them  just saying cheers peter
1084567,siwash,2023-04-07 12:18:00,683,"Thanks! I am targeting smaller inland lakes, though.. Â Lake O is great, I know, but not a body of water I plan to fish. Â Plus, I don't have the biggest boat.. Â 16' tiller, with medium depth hull."
1084568,BITEME,2023-04-07 14:18:00,1968,Pick your days and what you are comfortable with never had issues with lake o SMART BOATING HUGE PAY OFFS you would be shocked to know what is within your grasp in and around the Gta on lake o lots of trophy class fish #1. pay attention to the weather although beautiful and bountiful lake o can be very cruel very fast canâ€™t be anymore clear on this point! but you have to be comfortable â€¦as for the tiller whatâ€™s your point get out there and see for yourself hit the harbours and shore lines I promise you wonâ€™t be disappointed not sure what else to say itâ€™s all there go get â€˜em!  cheers Peter 
1084569,BITEME,2023-04-07 14:21:00,1968,You donâ€™t need to go deep the shorelines are a treasure trove forgot to mentionðŸ¤˜
1084572,CrowMan,2023-04-07 16:57:00,413,"Ice out Lakers on smaller lakes can be found all over the place...since they're not restricted by water temp at that time of year. Much easier to locate them in summer once the thermocline sets up. Fishing for them in early spring really depends on finding bait. Assuming surface temps are in the low 50's F or lower...if the main forage in the lake is Ciscos (fall spawners), Lakers tend to stay deeper...25 to 40 fow. If Shiners (spring spawners) are the primary food source, then the Trout will be shallower (15 to 30 fow). Keep in mind, that Lakers never really like to go too shallow...they feel most comfortable with some water on top of them. I usually like to start with trollingÂ  diving cranks like Tail Dancers, DD Husky Jerks, Bandits...since most Trout lakes have clear water, I like natural colours like silver/blue/green/purple. It's search mode fishing...covering as much water as possible, making S turns from shallow to deep...floating cranks (as opposed to spoons) have that nice rise and fall that covers more of the water column and triggers bites. Keep the speed around the 2mph mark. Once I find fish, I mark them and often cast or vertically fish soft plastic swimbaits or tubes...same colours as above, but pearl is also often a go to. However, a bait that really works well once you're on top of them is a jigging Rapala or an Acme Hyper Rattle (killer lure). Like you, I find them a lot more fun on light tackle, however I usually have one rod rigged up with just 2 or 3 colours of leadcore and then a 50ft FluoroCarbon leader...I usually fish this with a J-11 Rapala silver/ blue...a personal favorite. Save the downriggers for June and beyond. The other bonus of fishing inland lakes is that the Trout from them are great on the smoker...greasers from Lake O, not so much. Best of luck !    "
1084580,siwash,2023-04-08 01:42:00,683,"Great tips, Crowman! I've never really used body baits for lakers.. nor have I jigged for them.. And I'll have to check out the ACME lure. Â So is the ACME lure a jigging setup?  SO with the crank baits, you're not adding any weight, correct?"
1084581,CrowMan,2023-04-08 02:14:00,413,"Here's a video on fishing the Hyper Rattle...yes, it's a great Walleye bait too.. "
1084582,CrowMan,2023-04-08 03:29:00,413,"Yes, with deep divers no additional weight. I prefer running braid mainline with a 15 to 20 ft long 10lb FC leader. With shallow running body-baits like the J-11, I'll have maybe 150 ft of braid out, which is tiedÂ  to 2 to 3 colours of leadcore, then 50 ft of FC leader to the lure. You can also use snap weights 50 ft or so in front of the lure instead of the leadcore. It's all about getting that rise/fall action...I don't like any weight too close to the front of the lure. I like my lures to be somewhere in that 15 to 35 ft zone in early spring... it's just a program I have confidence in.."
1084583,siwash,2023-04-08 11:29:00,683,"Great info, again.... thanks.. I've use weights in the past with success that looked like a torpedo... eyelets on each end, so you tie you leader to one end, the other side, your main line. Â I forget what they are called but I bought them on a trip to the US. Harder to find here.. I'm sure Amazon sells every weight imaginable... I'd use 1, 1.5, 2 oz sizes with good results at a Halliburton Lake but that was over a decade ago and it's been a long time since I've done serious laker fishing! What is your favourite Flouro leader brand? I'm gonna try that ACEM bait.. holy cow, is it expensive... you like the natural colours, eh?"
1084588,CrowMan,2023-04-08 14:30:00,413,"The issues with tying on in-line weights like you describe are two-fold...a. since you're limited to tying them on no more than 6 to 7 ft in front of the lure, it impedes the rise/fall action...b. it's not very stealthy. Get some snap weight clips/releases for those torpedo weights . You let out your lure with about 50 ft of line, then clip on the weight and let out another 100 to 200 ft. When you reel in, simply remove the weight once it's within arms reach, and continue reeling in (or fighting the fish). https://www.sail.ca/en/off-shore-snap-weight-clip-429894-2837000001 I like Seaguar or Sunline fluorocarbon....10 to 12lb for this application. ""Purple Rain"" is usually the first colour I tie on with the Hyper Rattle.Â  Use a very small snap (but no swivel) for maximum action. ""holy cow, is it expensive"" Hmm...$12.99...I see you haven't purchased many Musky baits...Lol"
1084589,CrowMan,2023-04-08 15:01:00,413,"BTW, if you really want to take your trolling presentation to the next level...run your deep diver cranks or leadcore (or snap weights) off in-line planer boards."
1084590,siwash,2023-04-08 15:15:00,683,I'm cheap! LOL!
1084591,BillM,2023-04-08 21:05:00,17367,Flutter spoons and big hunks of lead for this guy.Â  Â Put a beating on them in GBay every spring.Â  Â Hopefully be out next weekend wetting some lines.
1084594,siwash,2023-04-08 23:13:00,683,"Anyone fish simcoe here, either early season or summer? I am barely 25 min from Innisfil (9 & 400 area) and I have never fished it for Lakers."

1084709,SirCranksalot,2023-04-16 00:53:00,3291,My bud and I have not had much luck the 2-3 times we went for 'ice out' lakers. Is it best to wait a little while------ maybe 2-3 weeks------or go right after ice out? As a kid I fished a lot for specks. They didn't seem to bite at all when the ice first went out. Two or three weeks later the fishing was generally quite good. Do lakers follow the same pattern? thx
1084710,siwash,2023-04-16 02:31:00,683,good question... my best laker fishing was always June.. water still coolish at the surface (60s) but they'd be down around 30'
1084774,BillM,2023-04-17 21:30:00,17367,"You need to figure out what they're eating.Â  Â Was out on Gbay on Sat and the magical depth was 65-75.Â  Â We jigged up some nice fish in over 100ft of water as well.Â  Â All fish were on steep transitions.Â  Â  We got them on everything.Â  Flutter spoons, body baits, vibrados, etc.Â  Â  Mark a pack, toss on the spot lock and we'd have 3-4 in the boat in no time.Â  Â Rinse and repeat.Â  Â Back out this weekend."
1084776,siwash,2023-04-17 21:42:00,683,What were they eating?
1084777,siwash,2023-04-17 21:43:00,683,I mean to say bait wise  smelt?

1084784,CrowMan,2023-04-17 23:40:00,413,"Yep...find bait, and you'll find Trout. Early season Lakers can be all over the place in the water column. Last spring, on a particularly warm early May day, my buddy and I were targeting pre-spawn Bass. We marked and were catching some big Smallies that were corraling baitfish along rock ledges in 15 fow. I had on a Spybait that resembled the minnows the Bass were coughing up. I'm doing that slow and steady Spybait retrieve...when wham...something much bigger hits it.Â  I felt a little under-gunned with a med-lite spinning rod and 6lb FC, but we got this Laker in the net. You just never know. As the old adage says...""find forage, find fish"" "
