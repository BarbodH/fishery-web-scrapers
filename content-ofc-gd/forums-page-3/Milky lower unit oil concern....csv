1084761,siwash,2023-04-17 18:34:00,683,"yes, 4 or 5 times. On one of the occasions it was a camping trip along the magnetewan. Â 3 days of running it hard, too. 4 guys loaded with gear. It ran well very last trip in October, it seems to big down or not reach full throttle. Â But I think it was because I switched to a bad tank that day. Â They other tank was empty so instead of refilling it I grabbed a smaller tank that was filled (with good fresh gas too)"
1084772,BITEME,2023-04-17 20:41:00,1968,Do all the stuff mentioned. I donâ€™t think you have a pooched motor get it back in the water couple hours running or what ever bring it in. Loosen the bottom plug let some fluid out honey is good creamed honey is bad while your at it change the plug(s) I think you'll be fine  peter
1084786,porkpie,2023-04-18 00:40:00,2521,What he said
1084807,siwash,2023-04-18 16:38:00,683,"So here is the oil after sitting in a mason jar for a few days... the water separation is clear but it's hard to tel how much water there is compared to pure oil. The motor ran for maybe a total of 20 hours or so, not that long..   "
1084834,DanD,2023-04-19 15:27:00,2223,"Read through all the support you have received here and it's all good advise!!! A couple of things that haven't been mentioned though. You should flush out the gear case. The milkshake looking oil, will still be in there covering the inside of the case walls and the gearing. I would suggest filling the case with either automatic trans fluid, kerosene or even diesel fuel. Then with the case in neutral, spin the prop shaft with some form of rotating tool. Drill, impact driver whatever you have that you can attach a socket to it and the prop shaft nut. I'm not talking about spinning the shaft at 10 thousand RPM; but just fast enough to splash that solvent around. Afterwards drain the case, if it still looks milky repeat again until it looks clear. The three fluids I mentioned are are oil and will not hurt anything; just allow it to drain completely and then add the new gear oil. As for pressure testing the gear case, you can make up your own tester; I've made a few when I was playing with outboard motor repairs. Find yourself a cheep automotive cooling system pressure tester.  Remove the rad attachment end of the tester's hose. Now find hollow fittings that will thread into the case's fill hole and that will fit the male threads of the tester's hose. Sometimes to coble this up can be difficult to find all the fittings. In that case, I'd find a longer bolt or screw for the fill hole. Cut the head off and then drill a small hold through the bolt/screw. Now thread the screw into the motor's case, leaving enough sticking out that you can hose clamp the tester's hose to the screw. Once ready do not pump anymore then about 8 or 10 pounds of pressure into the case. Have a spray bottle of soapy water ready and go nuts looking for where the leak MIGHT be? Sorry for the long post but how else could I have explained my thoughts? Thoughts of an old retired mechanic that sometimes comes out making perfect sense to me; but gibberish to others. LOL Dan..."
1084836,siwash,2023-04-19 16:43:00,683,"Excellent advice, DanD.Â  Very detailed and thorough... Thank you!"
1084902,siwash,2023-04-22 18:30:00,683,"Hey guys, what's the best grease to grease the prop shaft with? How about this? Â https://www.amazon.ca/Permatex-31832-Multi-Purpose-Synthetic-Grease/dp/B07YLLPN51/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1 Thanks"
1084906,Fisherman,2023-04-22 20:00:00,7201,That works or any other synthetic grease used for snowmobile bearings or boat trailer axles.
1084932,BassMan11,2023-04-24 18:26:00,583,This is the type of thread that makes this forum great. Hopefully you get it sorted out... I have a similar issue with my Etec 75... looks milky at the end of the season... most likely a prop seal according to this thread!  Good luck.  BM
1084702,Fisherman,2023-04-15 16:12:00,7201,"And if you can't remember how it all came apart, take pictures and lay items out left to right so they go back together in backwards order."
1084711,siwash,2023-04-16 03:05:00,683,Has anyone else noticed this -Â  a member here PM me and circled this spot.Â  I also noted in when I inspected the area and thought it could be trouble.. could this be my problem if it's not the seals? 
1084717,BITEME,2023-04-16 12:22:00,1968,I did notice that I though it was just crappy weld
1084724,AKRISONER,2023-04-16 14:11:00,5558,That might be your cracked lower end from freezingâ€¦ðŸ˜•Â hopefully not
1084725,Fisherman,2023-04-16 15:00:00,7201,That would be a disaster.
1084727,RickOnt,2023-04-16 15:20:00,669,"If the lower end is cracked from freezing, would oil not seep through crack?"
1084729,Fisherman,2023-04-16 15:38:00,7201,"If there's no pressure, maybe not.Â  Might be a really good idea to do a pressure test on it to lay that idea to rest."

1084734,dave524,2023-04-16 20:49:00,4508,Could hopefully just be some mould flash
1084735,Barry Willis,2023-04-16 21:13:00,180,I believe you are absolutely right Ohiofisherman. It is one piece and to me that is obviously a crack.
1084736,siwash,2023-04-16 21:32:00,683,"So if that's a crack, she's kaput?! You know that doesn't look like it just happened to me. Â I bought it in august of 2022. Worked well the couple of times I went out."
1084737,Barry Willis,2023-04-16 22:18:00,180,"It does appear to be a crack, and if so yes it is kaput, at least that part of it is. Sometimes they will run and seem fine for a while. But after time all that water in there is going to take its toll."
1084738,Terry,2023-04-16 22:20:00,14456,I would fill it out and take it out for a spin then check if there is more water in the oil there is also no pressure in that area so it is possible to jb Wield it
1084739,siwash,2023-04-17 01:17:00,683,"I was thinking of adding JB WELD... used it to seal an old tin boat years ago and was very effective. Can't hurt to try, eh? So maybe some hope of salvaging it?  Some honest opinions - if the motor is unsalvageable what is it worth (parts wise)?Â  I may have to sell it and want to be honest with a potential buyer (unlike the the last guy who sold it to me..) Caveat emptor... bloody Romans!"
1084740,siwash,2023-04-17 01:22:00,683, So I've performed PSI tests on my motors in the past.. pretty easy.. IS this the same kind of test or are we talking about a completely different kind of test?  Thanks guys...
1084741,Fisherman,2023-04-17 01:30:00,7201,"I don't know how much psi is needed otherwise you might blow out the remaining seal that's still ok.Â  Just a guess but no more than 10 psi, like Terry mentioned there's no real pressure buildup on the inside."
1084742,strik,2023-04-17 02:12:00,175,"Just saying the guy who sold it to u might have not know, we can assume all we want.  Either way always sucks when you purchase something used and find issues.  Best of luck with the fix"
1084743,porkpie,2023-04-17 05:42:00,2521,"I JB welded a crack in the oil pan on theÂ  bottom of our 1992 kawasaki bayou 220 10 years ago.Â  The kids are still tearing that old bike up today.Â  If that is a split, I'd JB it, sand it as smooth as you can and hit it with some paint.Â  My bet is it'll work just fine!"
1084744,siwash,2023-04-17 10:25:00,683,I hope you're right...!
1084745,siwash,2023-04-17 12:10:00,683,"Agreed... but I finding hard to imagine that this water issue just appeared for me this winter. Â And nor the crack. Â He said he had it for some time.. anyhow too late - buyer beware.. my fault. And when you buy old, used stuff, you can't expect not to have some issues. If I could afford new or newer, I wouldn't be buying an old motor!"
1084747,BITEME,2023-04-17 12:28:00,1968,Do beat yourself up poop happens and this didnâ€™t happen this winter this is a previous owner thing not your fault at all live and learn if you go the jb route after doing seals scarf up the area good where you are laying it down wipe it with acetone let it dry and go to it youâ€™ll be fine!! peter
1084750,siwash,2023-04-17 14:25:00,683,"Speaking of those seals, just received email from parts supplier (marine dealer up near Mactier) and they have them. I think I'll order a water pump/impeller kit too and change that sooner than later. should I change out anything else while I'm at it? I might as well put the parts on that order. thanks all!!"
1084751,Terry,2023-04-17 14:35:00,14456,I would put jb wield on it and fill up the oil and test it first if the small crack is what let the water in and jb wield works you are good to go and there will be no more water id the crack canâ€™t be fixed donâ€™t throw away money on a piece of crap
1084758,BITEME,2023-04-17 17:41:00,1968,Have you ever had this motor running??
1084760,siwash,2023-04-17 18:32:00,683,Yes I have. 4 times last year. see my next message. Tried to edit here.
1084640,siwash,2023-04-13 01:25:00,683,I didn't get around to draining the lower unit oil on my outboard in the fall.. this is the first winter I had the boat (purchased in late spring 2022). Â I stored it in my unheated garage. I drained it today... What can I make of this? Â How bad is this? Â thanks...   
1084645,BillM,2023-04-13 02:27:00,17367,I'd guess you've got water getting in somewhere.
1084647,Barry Willis,2023-04-13 03:02:00,180,"Howdy Siwash, More often than not the water gets in through the prop shaft seal. Personally I would take it to a reputable marina or some one that has the knowledge etc. to do the job and they will or should also inspect the gears and bearings and put it through a pressure test in order to determine if you need any other seals replaced. I have seen it happen just from the screw. Good luck Bud."
1084649,Barry Willis,2023-04-13 03:48:00,180,"Further to - Not to come across as a smart a$& know it all but if you chose to do this yourself a pressure test will tell you where the water is getting in, this should be done carefully or you will wlnd up blowing seals that do not need replaced. I am sure I do not have to tell you obviously a fair bit of water has entered the leg to be that milky. I never thought of it before but there are likely some videos on Yutube but ya have to be careful there to."
1084650,glen,2023-04-13 06:13:00,2641,Put the oil in a bottle and let it sit overnight. Then you can how much water is in the oil.
1084653,siwash,2023-04-13 10:20:00,683,"And what will that tell me? I guess the more you have the worse... can this motor be run? Does this indicate a serious, costly problem? Â This is the first time I've had water in a lower unit outboard I've owned.  Also, can someone recommend a reputable marine mechanic in the north-west corner of York Region? Â I am between Schomberg and the 400 just south of #9... so Anything from Newmarket, Bradford, Aurora (all 20 min) or even places like Bolton, King City, Tottenham or even Vaughan... all of those locations are within 30 min of me.  Thanks!!"
1084673,Rizzo,2023-04-14 00:49:00,4754,"if the water just came in thru a seal, and your garage didnt get too ridiculously cold (ie it is attached to the house) it might not be too big a deal. Just my thoughts."
1084674,siwash,2023-04-14 00:53:00,683,Yeah it's attached to the house... and we had a mild winter...  I didn't use the boat/motor too much. Â It ran fine. It must have been damaged before I bought it.
1084676,Fisherman,2023-04-14 02:07:00,7201,"Not to sound evil but here's the proof that maintenance has to be done before putting things away. At worst, I hope for your sake the water in the mix didn't get to freeze, expand and cause cracks/splits in the lower housing.Â  The same goes for pulling wheel bearings in the fall, sitting with hubs full of water isn't good either.Â  Lesson learned."
1084678,siwash,2023-04-14 10:03:00,683,"Agreed... if i had at least drained it, I could at least sleep well know that the above wouldn't happen.. but it was already leaking.Â  The guy I bought it off did not reveal this... Caveat Emptor!"
1084680,Terry,2023-04-14 11:28:00,14456,"Top gun marine is the guy most of the tournament guys take their boat to for repair, he is on highway 11 between Bradford and Innisfil"
1084682,BITEME,2023-04-14 13:17:00,1968,Here is my take on this I have had lots of experience in this you had water during the boating season for sure it didnâ€™t happen over the winter if it did stay emulsified over the winter you should be okay you said used itâ€™s likely time I try to do the seal every two years religiously unless I see what your seeing going forward if you want to drain in the fall fine but replace the oil you drain donâ€™t let them sit dry this is a quick fix without getting soaked by a dealer the prop seal is very easy to do in your driveway do this first and run the motor on the water for a week if itâ€™s milky again you could have other issues and it could be higher up the drive if not your a champ you didnâ€™t say how big your motor was not that it matters pretty much all the same on the drive end its easy you can do it cheers peter
1084683,BITEME,2023-04-14 13:22:00,1968,If you want to pay me to fly out from Nova Scotia Iâ€™ll come do it but in reality I will say again itâ€™s easy to do and doesnâ€™t take long I only did pressure tests on the rescue boat drives as of roof of repair( needs to be reliable)
1084686,siwash,2023-04-14 15:50:00,683,"Thanks so much, Biteme... I will try your steps first before I take it to a mechanic.  "
1084687,siwash,2023-04-14 15:52:00,683,So we are talking about the seal at the prop?Â  I'm also going to check the drain screws as well... I didn't notice the washers on them when I unscrewed them. Either they are crushed onto the metal or they are missing altogether.
1084689,BITEME,2023-04-14 17:51:00,1968,Yes we are talking about the seal at the prop and both fill screws upper and lower should have either o rings or crush washers
1084690,lew,2023-04-14 18:04:00,12766,
1084691,AKRISONER,2023-04-14 18:43:00,5558,"As mentioned above, this most certainly looks like a failed prop shaft seal. Just out of curiousity, what would be the problem with leaving the lower end without oil over the winter. Not that Iâ€™ve personally done it, I think one time my bottle pump broke so I was stuck for a day with no oil, but just curious as to why a sitting motor lower end that obviously still got a film of oil all over it would be damaged by sitting for a couple of months with no oil.  either way siwash, lesson learned, at minimum undo that screw at the end of the year, no matter what get the years gear oil the hell out of there even if itâ€™s nowhere near as watery as this. Being fair this is some of the worst looking oil I have ever seen, that crank case was completely full of water as far as I can tell. You may get really lucky and have no other damage. My buddies merc used to leak water too not anywhere close to this extent but if youâ€™re lucky the water didnâ€™t expand and crack your Lower end. if youâ€™re like my buddy you might get away with it for a year. this kinda stuff haunts me when I think about the fact my boat is used, who knows what kind of maintenance or lack thereof people do at the end of the year. Iâ€™m not as much of a nutcase to be changing my prop shaft seal every 2 years as referenced above, but I sure as hell change the lower end oil, fog the motor, change fuel filters every 100 hours, stabilize my ethanol free fuel etc etc hopefully worth it in the long run, high performance engines ainâ€™t cheap in 2023!"
1084693,porkpie,2023-04-15 00:36:00,2521,"Iâ€™ve seen worse. Â I had an old Johnson 25hp that ran flooded like this on many occasions when I was a teenager. Â It never crapped out on me. Â Yes if it froze it would be bad news, and certainly at some point with oil like that you could have a catastrophic failure. Â But I expect youâ€™ll probably be ok as it was in a garage. Â Get the seals changed. As for leaving an outboard empty of gear oil. Â I did it once or twice when pressed for time in the fall on my old boat. Â No harm no foul. Â But you do need to put a few wraps of orange flagging tape around the lower as a visual reminder that you need to fill it up in the spring!"
1084694,siwash,2023-04-15 11:19:00,683,So I took the prop off... no fishing line wrapped around it... the screws have their washers in place.Â  I'll replace those. See pics below the video.. I see from the video that the seals are imbedded into the shaft and require to be pulled out using some of the methods in this video... I found this video - how does this method look?     
1084695,BITEME,2023-04-15 11:53:00,1968,Video looks good just take time you can do it!!!  cheers Peter
1084696,siwash,2023-04-15 12:07:00,683,I'm wondering if I should try to get at the seal by unscrewing these screws and pull off that lower piece (keel)?   
1084698,BITEME,2023-04-15 13:02:00,1968,The video method is good I have taken seals out like that not going to lie taking it off is my preferred method I would suggest you go one set of screws higher and get access to the water pump and change that rubber impeller worse thing is to be out in the middle of your favourite lake and not pumping cooling water once you undo it it will drop a bit and hang on the shift linkage usually a coupler with 2 set screws loosen Â the lower and the lower unit will come away put it up on a bench and go to town you will see the housing for the impeller you canâ€™t miss it troll some forums specific to your mortor first time is always painful and bloody take your time be patient use your cell for disassembly and reassembly the money you save buy a new toy for the boat and take pride in your new skill YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!! cheers peter  
1084699,BITEME,2023-04-15 13:11:00,1968,One more thing and this may not be kosher for everyone and may not even be necessary when I put it all back together again I usually sneer a thin layer of gasket maker on the flat matting surfaces peace out peter
1084701,AKRISONER,2023-04-15 14:29:00,5558,"Also, donâ€™t forget to throw some grease on the gear shaft when reinserting it up into the top end, it will make your life a hell of a lot easier!"
