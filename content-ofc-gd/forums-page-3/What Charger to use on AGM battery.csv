1085456,RickOnt,2023-05-25 12:42:00,669,Can I use my Eliminater charger?  It is a in the garage charger not on board It has 2a 10a 20a and 40a settings Also has a CCA setting No start setting
1085459,KraTToR,2023-05-25 13:20:00,506,"Yes, it will work fine but you'll benefit in the long run by having a dedicated charger. As a rule of thumb your battery charger should be 10% - 20% of the Ah rating of the battery. E.g A 100Ah battery would require a 10 Amp charger as a minimum. To prevent overcharging, you should keep the charger size to within 30% of the total capacity.  "
1085470,RickOnt,2023-05-25 20:00:00,669,the batttery I am looking at has 105ah rating So I should use the 10a setting on the charger correct??
1085476,KraTToR,2023-05-26 13:09:00,506,Based on what I wrote above you could use up to 30 amps so I would use 10 or 20 (on board chargers typically max out at 15A). Most important thing is not to partially charge or leave it discharged for long periods.
1085478,RickOnt,2023-05-26 13:53:00,669,Will do Thanks for info  KraTTor Much appreciated
