And since we lack saltwater here... lol Now I've used this fish online app to help locate fishing areas but i haven't had any luck finding a lake with the listed crappie, mostly pike and walleye (is it out of date?) I've driven to a few lakes in the parry sound area but being disabled and getting skunked is discouging and rough on my body. Could anyone help me pin point a lake or group of lakes to try closer to the sudbury area for crappie? Either through PM or here? I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
1085185,CrowMan,2023-05-10 16:03:00,413,"There's definitely Crappie in the French River Delta on Georgian Bay...that's probably the closest place to Sudbury that I know about. I'm guessing they're in Lake Nipissing too...not sure if in fishable numbers. I've personally never caught one there, but I've heard reports of their existence."
1085190,Terry,2023-05-10 16:24:00,14456,North channel and Spanish river has crappie
1085191,Reef Runner,2023-05-10 16:28:00,980,"Itâ€™s purported that Ramsey Lake right in Sudbury have Crappies. Otherwise, the French R and bodies south. We spend a week on the Key R every summer and get lots (boat access only) but imagine they can be had from shore off the highway. Reef"
1085199,RollinStoned,2023-05-11 03:26:00,2,Thank you. Any other small lakes off the highway I could cast from shore? I dont mind the drive if it's fishable and in and out of the boat gets hard week to week so a chair or standing is sometimes better for me and I don't mind a hike through a trail. Thanks again.
