713986,fishnsled,2012-07-12 15:24:00,3520,Great report and pics!! Welcome aboard!!      I was thinking Lake Herring myself.	It seems the tail is more pointed in the photo and a fallfish tail is more rounded if I'm remembering correctly and the scales seem smaller then a fallfish. Difficult to tell from the head by the way it is being held. I'm no expert but would like to know what it is.
714008,johnnyb,2012-07-12 16:55:00,3413,"  Okay, bad enough that you're mentioning that spot at all.,......but TWICE?!?!?!?!"
714092,peter23,2012-07-12 21:25:00,95," i am the one holding the whitefish, it was not a lake herring because it had a nose going downward just like the whitefish do, while the herring have a pointed nose"
1085305,dave1965,2023-05-16 18:57:00,41,I know this post is from 2012. But we're heading up to Net Lake in a couple of weeks. We've been there several times but the last time was about 10 years ago. We've always had a wonderful time up there as the scenery is spectacular. I' hoping the fishing will be good and I'll send a report when I get back. We're staying at Andorra Lodge. Wish us luck!  Dave
713103,shimano19,2012-07-09 21:46:00,196,"hey everyone, new to the forum but ive been fishing my whole life, my names mike and im 19. heres a little report of some fishing in temagami on net lake.  we arrived early monday morning and immediatly hit the lake, the sun was already up and beating down on us. we figured the smallmouth would be sitting deeper because of the heat so we decided to find some nice rock shoals and humps in the 15-20 FOW range. keep in mind we did not have a fish finder. we were fishing tubes and crankbaits. we managed to get a few nice bass but with only catching a couple smallmouth in 3 hours we decided to head to the cottage and wait for the sun to start setting.    later that night when the sun was almost set we headed out in the lake in seach of rocky bottoms with weeds and logs. we found the perfect bay and was actually our honey hole for the week. the bait of choice for the smallies were poppers, didnt matter if it the heddon pop'n image, rapala skitter pop or the strike king spit n king in any pattern they were just smoking them. seeing these bass hit these baits on the top of the water kept the excitment going, not to mention the jumps these acrobats did. the action on the popers was all week for about an hour in the morning and an hour at night. after the poper bite died down it was difficult to locate the bass, we searched everywhere and fished all depths using many baits, we managed to get some on rapala husky jerks and a couple on tubes with the odd one on a spinner bait. so we went in search for some pike, we found a calm back bay that looked like prime pike teritory, about 8 FOW with scattered weeds and cattails with lots of baitfish. being in that bay for 5 minutes and we already lost a nice one on a #5 mepps tipped with a gulp alive and had a monster pike follow a chartruse spinner bait to the boat, by the end of that night we landed many pike but nothing to huge, we returned back other mornings and nighs but not a single pike was hooked or seen.        so now it was time to find some eyes. we were fishing drop offs and rock humps using deep cranks and jigging minnows and worms but we had no luck in finding any walleye but we had a nice surprise from this little guy fishing in 20 FOW.   in the end it was a great week and some off the best smallmouth fishing ive done. all fish were released. hope you guys enjoy!"

713129,Terry,2012-07-09 22:24:00,14456,nice bass
713131,Rod Caster,2012-07-09 22:29:00,5784,great average size for those top water smallies  nice suprise indeed on that whitefish. I havn't caught one in years.  I tried Net lake a couple winters ago but never properly explored the lake...now you've got me intrigued
713152,Muskieman,2012-07-09 23:09:00,2472,"Welcome aboard ... Nice Catch !!! Net Lake is an awesome # , I know it well I used to live right on it , BIG Pike , Walleye , Lakers and Smallies of course  , which end were you in ? East or West of the 11 bridge ?"
713158,spincast,2012-07-09 23:19:00,3279,welcome aboard - nice intro report
713167,Joeytier,2012-07-09 23:49:00,3990,"Good stuff.  I was close to the area this weekend.  Smallie fishing is excellent just about everywhere up there, but also completely blanked on the walleye.  Water is already warm as hell, and the walters seem to be well into their summer doldrums.  Just being up there is the best part though!"
713176,NAW,2012-07-10 00:14:00,4022,Welcome aboard man!  Looks like you'll fit right in here
713177,RickOnt,2012-07-10 00:15:00,669,Hi Mike  Great post and some nice Smallies!  Thanks Rick
713180,bucktail,2012-07-10 00:23:00,1857,Nice fish man!  Welcome aboard!
713234,Moosebunk,2012-07-10 03:30:00,3970,Good show dood!  Float tubed there a couple times before right off the highway after a buddy from Cobalt told me to try it out for smallies.  You and your dad did better than me.  Some good smallies.
713238,Dan668,2012-07-10 03:34:00,1120,I always do well on net for smallies. Some big ones in there too. Caught my pb off red squirrel road in a small lake
713239,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 03:37:00,2710,Some very nice fish and an excellent report. Welcome to the board
713244,adolson,2012-07-10 04:43:00,783,"Good job, man!  I fished Net Lake twice, once this past Saturday and caught NOTHING and once last year, when I caught this hawg:    Edit: I actually just remembered I fished it once in the winter. I had one bite, I guessed to be a laker, took my minnow off my tube jig right as it hit bottom. Other than that, nothing but the son of a perch in the pic."
713491,shimano19,2012-07-10 21:35:00,196, i think we were on the east end.
713492,shimano19,2012-07-10 21:36:00,196, ive tried shore fishing on net lake before and had no luck on anything decent
713494,shimano19,2012-07-10 21:37:00,196,thanks for all the comments
713525,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-10 23:02:00,2690,"Welcome aboard, great report."
713594,Dave Bailey,2012-07-11 02:01:00,1641,"That's one heck of a good report, looks like you had a ton o' fun! I have good memories of Net Creek from about 40 years ago. We were visiting friends in Latchford, and went to the dam area for the afternoon to do some swimming and fishing. We started out with the snorkels, and while I was under I noticed some nice size bass. Then an old piece of mono with a spoon on the end caught my eye, and I held my breath long enough to unhook it from the sunken log it was snagged on. I went back to shore, attached the line to a piece of wood, and went back under to dangle it in front of whatever I could find. Then the others grabbed their fishing gear and snorkels and did the same thing. We caught some nice ones that day, and all while we were underwater!"
713616,Toad Hunter,2012-07-11 04:10:00,261,"great pix !!! curious as to how you go about finding the rocky bottoms, and drop offs with out a finder ?  maybe its a trick I can learn rather than spending money on a battery charger when mine inevitably dies ?? just messing with you, welcome to the forums, and looking forward to more of such fish porn"
713619,Roy,2012-07-11 04:35:00,13728,"BTW, I think your whitefish is actually a fallfish and a nice one at that."
713966,adolson,2012-07-12 14:13:00,783,"I only tried from shore once, and that's the only time I caught anything. I am sure I'll try the lake again, but there are hundreds around here for me to choose from. Are you from this area?"
713980,Muskieman,2012-07-12 15:04:00,2472,"Tons of walk to lakes to choose from , Kanichee Mine Rd is another very good spot... Shhh."
