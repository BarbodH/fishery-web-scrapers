1084623,Spiel,2023-04-12 14:10:00,9065,"I walk my pup several times a day and lately the Coniferous trees about the neighbourhood have been shedding lot's of seed cones and I had the idea to try and make reels seats out of them. Well the first, possibly a first anywhere is now done. There's definitely room for improvement but as the first prototype out of the shop I'm very pleased with the end results. I envisioned something once completed that would resemble fish scales and by golly I believe they do.   	So, here it is from start to finish........        "
1084624,HTHM,2023-04-12 14:25:00,4082,"Looks good, I believe cones will accept a stain very well, so possible colourization in the future? If you gather in the early fall, while the cones are still tight, the scale effect might be enhanced."
