1084847,Barry Willis,2023-04-19 20:48:00,180,Found a small wolf track and a good size cougar track near my camera this morning. But not near enough to get them on film. Hope fully next time. I should have placed something on the ground next to them to give them some scale as in size. To late smart as usual.  
1084851,CrowMan,2023-04-19 22:37:00,413,Very nice...what part of the Province is your camera located ?
1084853,Barry Willis,2023-04-19 23:44:00,180,I'm sorry I never answered you question The camera is located about an hours drive north west of the house here in Calgary. LOL. That's one bonus living here we can be right in the mountains within an hours drive from the house. It's something we never tire of.

Pretty sure it's too big for a coyote and no big dogs around here at the time so I'm guessing a wolf....any thoughts?  
1084858,Barry Willis,2023-04-20 15:23:00,180,"Good morning Lew. Haha, It's funny you ask, when I was just a wee lad thanks to my dear old Dad I took such an interest in all aspects of nature (still do) and especially tracks for a couple years and published a few videos and a book that I simply called wild animal tracks of Canada.  That is  without a doubt a wolf track from a pretty much full grown wolf. you're right it is too big for a coyote, a coyote track is seldom if ever longer than 3in. A dog track is more roundish as a wolf track is long with the four distinct toes. Normal length for a wolf track is 5in. long and 3-4in. wide. I've only ever seen one bigger. The longest wolf track ever documented (I don't remember when)  was in the NWT 7.5 in. long. I would have loved to have seen the wolf that left that track. I'm glad you shared it thank you."
