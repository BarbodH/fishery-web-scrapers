1085208,Glenn,2023-05-11 18:04:00,3,"Hey Gang, I was just wondering if anyone can suggest some good pike lakes within an hour or so from Toronto for a day trip of fishing? Looking forward to getting out in my fishing kayak to get some action! I know Simcoe is a popular lake, but looking for a body of water that isn't so big. I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thank you, Glenn"
1085209,CrowMan,2023-05-11 18:24:00,413,You don't even have to leave TO...inside of the Leslie St spit has plenty of Pike with a shot at a 40 Other than that...within an hour of downtown ? A lot of the Conservation Areas have lakes with decent populations of hammer-handles.
1085214,BillM,2023-05-11 19:51:00,17367,Definitely no need to leave Toronto to catch some nice gators.
1085225,Glenn,2023-05-11 22:13:00,3,Thanks guys! I am hoping to find a smaller lake up north. I salmon fish through July/August so I see plenty of Lake Ontario! Glenn
1085246,BillM,2023-05-12 17:26:00,17367,Cooks Bay would be a good choice (Lake Simcoe)  Not a smaller lake though.
1085247,HTHM,2023-05-12 17:29:00,4082,Long point bay Lake Erie
1085251,Reef Runner,2023-05-12 20:06:00,980,"For conservation areas within an hour Mountsburg close to Guelph or Island Lake in Orangeville. These places get hammered pretty hard so expect a pressured fishery and plenty of hammer handles. If you’re willing to stretch the drive to 1.5-2 hours to the Kawartha’s, namely, Canal, Mitchell and Balsam Lakes hold some good pike. Reef"
