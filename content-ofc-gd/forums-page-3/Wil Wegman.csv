1085378,Britton Grant,2023-05-22 13:07:00,14,I met Will a long time ago at Erieau just outside Chatham on Lake Erie.  He was there to fish with Bob Izumi and his brother Wayne. They were born in Blenheim. He was a nice guy/ Very friendly!

1085457,Britton Grant,2023-05-25 12:49:00,14,I looked up his obituary and it looks like he is to be buried in Bradford. Ont. Donations are to Cancer Society so that must be what happened.
