1084476,Terry,2023-04-01 17:18:00,14456,I see you didnâ€™t follow the link to see which states it said APRIL FOOLS
1084477,limeyangler,2023-04-01 17:33:00,5204,Lolâ€¦ they played me good.
1084480,AKRISONER,2023-04-01 21:44:00,5558,Randy blauket write this? ðŸ˜‚
1084492,captpierre,2023-04-02 22:39:00,2521,April fools but isnâ€™t there some truth to it? Â  Where is the line?
1084495,CrowMan,2023-04-02 23:06:00,413,"I have no problem with the gov't managing the resource through seasons, limits, slot sizes, sanctuary zones, number of rods/hooks, barbless, artificials only, etc...but restricting the way in which I can ""find"" fish...well, that's over the line for me. Regardless, trying to prohibit technology never works."
1084496,AKRISONER,2023-04-03 01:05:00,5558,"Letâ€™s ban outboards and trolling motors, they do far more to put fishermen on fish than livescope ever has."
1084497,porkpie,2023-04-03 01:52:00,2521,"Funny that you mention that, there are a some US states that have banned trail cameras, or cellular trail cameras for hunting.Â  Not that far of a stretch to ban some technology for fishing.Â  I'd be some pissed if they banned ipilot lol."
1084500,David Chong,2023-04-03 12:45:00,836,APRIL FOOLS!!!
1084513,dave524,2023-04-03 17:48:00,4508,Canada has banned a very long list of guns for hunting
1084515,BillM,2023-04-03 20:40:00,17367,PMTT has banned it (Professional Muskie Tournament Trail)
1085404,Terry,2023-05-23 15:26:00,14456,"Well it isnâ€™t banned , but I for one wouldnâ€™t be happy they are just another tool and it is amazing if one takes the time to learn how to use it"
1085406,misfish,2023-05-23 16:09:00,29133,"Learn to fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, LMAO "
1085417,Dara,2023-05-23 22:24:00,3052,"If they actually managed the resource. I think they do a crap job of it as it is all reaction rather than actual planning and management. I had a co make a crappy comment to me this winter about keeping a small lake trout and I told him I just wanted one little guy for breakfast. Then his partner goes on to say that a laker doesn't mature till about 22 inches for reproduction. So whats the point. Do you know what you are talking about or not. Not you crow, him"
