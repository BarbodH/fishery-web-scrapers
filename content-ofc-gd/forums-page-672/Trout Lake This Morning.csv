The wind was pretty stiff, so I drifted across in front of Average Joe's back to the loading dock area for quite some time dragging a worm harness.  Got several little perch (so not skunked I guess...lol) but nothing else.  Sonar was marking quite a few fish hanging around where the water dropped off from 15 to 30+ feet, but guess they didn't care for a worm breakfast.  Riding into the waves to make another pass, eventually battered loose a rib in the Sportspal (need to remember to put some weight up front).  I'll keep plugging away at that lake, since its in my backyard, until I get something photo-worthy"
