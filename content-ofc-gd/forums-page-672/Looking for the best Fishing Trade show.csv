I am aware of the shows in central Ontario but the bordering states have some great events that I wish to learn more about. If you attend fishing/tourism events in the Northern United States, which are the most popular and well attended?  Thanks for any help.  Mike"

Details at icastfishing.org or asafishing.org.  It's pretty much the one show everyone in the recreational fishing industry attends. Canadian shows, and the regional US shows, are all pretty Mickey Mouse by comparison."
474664,Michael_Brown,2010-06-11 02:09:00,411,Thanks Craig.  I'm looking for general public events that are well run and attended.  I have heard ICAST is pretty awesome.
