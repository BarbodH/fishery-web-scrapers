Both fish hooked on an inline bolt rig with a combo of 1 kernel floating gulp corn, and two kernels regular canned corn on the hair. So this was my first carp actually landed using anything other than corn on a hook under a float.  Starting to gain some confidence in using more refined rigs. Fish was 28"", not huge by any means but it's a start. Swam away strong after a quick picture. Lots of massive fish active in the area, but I guess they are waiting for me to go back and get them another day.   Take care!"

475133,mbosh1980,2010-06-12 20:51:00,349,Question for the more experienced carp anglers out there. Anyone know of a reasonably accurate formulae for figuring out the weight of carp using the weight and girth measurements? I've found some online but they vary pretty wildly in their guesstimates. Thanks

475135,Victor,2010-06-12 21:37:00,1609,"Nicely done.  IMO it would be quite hard to get a ""reasonably-accurate"" estimation by just inputing weight and girth measurements for carp. Their shape just varies way too much."
475140,mbosh1980,2010-06-12 21:59:00,349, Makes sense.  Thanks.
