474191,Harrison,2010-06-09 22:01:00,2202,"Thanks Johnny, but don't fish for a living anymore so I don't consider myself a pro, just a friend who could maybe offer something different to try.  Wil, this could work as I am still on the hunt for a boat.  Maybe we could all set something up!  ""Cliff Walleye Challenge"" The CWC event winner(Cliff by default)buys the beer!  Win win all around."
474196,JohnF,2010-06-09 22:31:00,3494, Somebody tell him he can't be talkin' about sacrificing virgins in front of his own very daughter. No wonder she calls him a goat. At least I assume she meant him when she said she'd bring the goat.  JF
474200,Big Cliff,2010-06-09 22:42:00,6899,"Well, I sure appreciate all the offers of advice, I haven't stored my rods anywhere near gas, bug repellant, or anything else that I can think of that wouuld impart a scent. I usually use any one of 4 different rods when I am out, two with mono, two with braid. The one mono rod is rigged with 6 lb, the other with 8 lb..  Roy, if I knew what I was doing wrong I wouldn't be doing it LOL. The only consolation I have right now is that my next door neighbour who has also fished this lake for about 20 years isn't doing any better than I am.  As far as someone hiding a banana on the boat, well, all I can say is they must have done a darn good job of hiding it because I can't find it LOL.  Harrison that is a very kind offer and I'd love to get out with you but I am already comitted this Sunday and if the weather man is right, we'd be dodging thunder storms anyway. Any other time that works for you?  My darling Daughter Teressa, you know that nice pickerel dinner I told you I would bring up; get the goat ready, I have a good recipe for curried goat because as it stands right now you are just going to have to do without the fresh pickerel.  Sinker that is just plain adding insult to injury LOL. Right in front of my place eh? Guess I'll just have to start fishing for muskie, oh wait, I haven't been catching them either LOL.  I haven't tried night fishing yet but I might just have to!  Ron, if I haven't figured them out by mid July I might just have to take you up on that!  John, I'd be embarrased to have you come up fishing with the way my luck has been going!"
474243,Teressa,2010-06-10 00:36:00,55,"Aw Dad, I don't mind going without pickerel...I would be satisfied with a nice meal of pike or bass when you come up, at this point even a barbutt supper is making my mouth water, those trout we caught last Sunday were good, but I miss the variety. I know why you haven't been catching anything Dad, the fish are taking a break with you until we get down there. Or you could always try Grandpa's trick...he used to tell me you need to sing to them to get them to bite...always worked with him, he just wasnt sure if they bit so they wouldnt have to hear him anymore or if they enjoyed his singing"
474244,JohnF,2010-06-10 00:41:00,3494," Oh, that's just great. Now all over Ontario yer gonna be hearing the painful sound of fishermen doing their best Bing Crosby for the fish. I can't even begin to imagine what our lakes are gonna sound like, and the fish may all just migrate to OHIO or something.  Sheesh!  JF"
474297,fish-miester,2010-06-10 02:40:00,864,Hey Cliff I caught another one out there  ... only one tho !
474300,limeyangler,2010-06-10 02:51:00,5204,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....curried goat....that is good stuff!
474400,jimmer,2010-06-10 15:00:00,2730,"Hey Cliff The slump has started for me again after those two amazing days.  All great athletes go through a slump, so hang in there, it should be over soon.  Seriously, try the suggestion of fishing off the dock at night, I know another guy that does that and has success on Sturgeon."
474413,fisher,2010-06-10 15:41:00,451,check pm.
474447,fish-miester,2010-06-10 17:00:00,864,"Cliff im not sure where you live on the lake, but me and my buddy were fishin it yesterday.. wind sucked so we ended up trolling and well we caught 1 each, (16'' and 17'') slowly trolling a beetle spin / white grub. also hooked into probably one of the biggest largies I have ever seen..(trolling) didnt plan it nor did I land it.  also caught some HUGE rock bass and sunfish ! and well a ton of perch that wouldnt leave our lures alone"
474470,fish-miester,2010-06-10 17:40:00,864,  ya there are some BIG fish in the Kawartha's my buddy hooked into a good 6lb smallie the last time i was on Scugog..  but if you find scattered weed beds in about 4-6' of water let your beetle spin or hair jig fall into the pockets then rip it out. as well cast and reel along the top and edges of it. seem to work for me. I find the more contact you have with the bottom the better. alot of my fish I have been catching are right along bottom. expecially on sunny days. though on over cast days they arnt as tight to the structure.. hope that helps
474482,Big Cliff,2010-06-10 18:06:00,6899,"One of my go to lures over the years for walley has been a #2 or #3 silver mepps (very similar to the beetle spin and we tip it with two (not one, not three) 1"" white twister tails and they always produce for me(except this year). In fact the only hit I did have the other evening that I thought might have been a walleye was on one of those mepps.  I just stopped in to Queensway Bait this afternoon and picked up another 6 bucktails with different head colours and tail configurations. I also picked up a spool of 10lb fluro leader material which I am going to use on my braided lines. One thing I am thinking is that I have been using a snap swivel on my lines this year to facilitate changing up more quickly. I can't remember that ever being a problem before but I am starting to wonder if the extreemly clear water and the snap swivel could be making any difference. If I remember correctly in years gone by I have always tied directly to my line and I only started using braid this year too. The more I think about it when I fished and guided in the French I would never use anything but 6 lb mono Crystal Clear Line with no leader, no snap swivel and a smaller hook than you would normally consider using for walleye. I WILL figure this out!!!!!"
474484,Raf,2010-06-10 18:14:00,3495,"Tie direct, no hardware.  In the case of braid + fluoro either join the two lines with a uni to uni or use the tiniest swivel you have.  Tie the leader directly to the jig with some type of cinch knot & push the knot towards the hook so the jig sits horizontal in the water.  a snap will just cause the jig to flop around and sit vertically.  you probably know all this stuff so forgive me!!  here's a tease.   also remember the spring bite was over a looooooooooong time ago this year.  i don't know what type of water you are fishing but i don't think you'll get them on typical late may early june spots."
474486,fish-miester,2010-06-10 18:17:00,864,haha Cliff I know how ya feel! tho I have been using 15lb braid when Im fishing weeds. and I try and have a 8-10 lb Fluro Leader when fishing open/clear water.. as for the snap swivel.. who knows.. I guess it just depends how picky the walleye are.  ps#1 try trolling through red bouy's #cp12-cp13  ps#2 where is Queensway Bait? never heard of it..
474495,Sinker,2010-06-10 18:34:00,8692,"Ok, I catch quite a few walleye. I consider myself pretty good at catching them, BUT, I've NEVER caught one on a bucktail. I won't even waste my time with those damn things!!! 3"" white grub on a pink 1/4oz head is all ya need to catch walleye out of sturgeon. Either that, or a big ass black and orange musky spinner bait  No need to go far, I'm getting them about 500m from your doorstep. Straight west. Find the deep weed edge, and have atter.  15lb power pro, to an 8lb fluoro leader, tied with a uni-uni. No swivel, no snaps. Just drag it along bottom, nice and slow.  They're in there Cliff, go get 'em!!!   s."
474508,Big Cliff,2010-06-10 19:08:00,6899," Sorry, my bad, it is Kawartha Lakes Bait And Tackle on Queen St. Lindsay."
474512,fish-miester,2010-06-10 19:18:00,864, haha I was going to say. I check out as many fish'n stores as I can and learn which 1s have the best prices for each items
474536,Big Cliff,2010-06-10 20:01:00,6899," I really like dealing there, the owner is a very quiet guy, never pushy, but the more I get to know him, the more I like him. I find his prices for most things to be quite good, I got a really nice ultralite outfit in there a couple of weeks ago for $35.00 and he has a very good selection of baits and tackle. I buy my worms from him now, $12.00/100. Sure beats paying $2.50 a dozen. Besides that, I'd rather support the little guy."
474539,fish-miester,2010-06-10 20:15:00,864,"  agreed, hes quiet but at the same time he will tell ya pretty much anything you would like to know. and on top of all that if you want somthing that he doesnt have in the shop he can order and get it for you! and well ya his prices arnt all that bad at all"
474775,Harrison,2010-06-11 12:46:00,2202," No worries, I am pretty busy from now on bud.  With bass opener coming up and fishing a few tournaments this year, getting back into the game, time is gone.  Raf and Sinker both hit the nail on the head with their guidance on the uni uni.  Sinker even gave you the area we'd be fish'n Cliff.  Good luck."
474944,Sinker,2010-06-12 03:45:00,8692,"  I've been shopping there for years now cliff. Gerry is a great guy. He also makes some nice musky baits. He'll custom make a lot of different lures in any colour you want. Just ask. He's a great guy to deal with for warranty stuff too. I take all my broken stuff to him, and he always makes me happy. I've even had him bring bait to his house for me to pick up after hours.........good guy for sure. Don't forget he sells all hunting/fishing licenses too! The other guy up the road wouldn't get my business if he was the last guy on the planet.......what a knob!!  S."
474983,Big Cliff,2010-06-12 11:30:00,6899,"Well, I did get out last night, fished from about 7 until about 9:30, tried both bucktails and pink jig/white grub. No hits on the bucktails but I have been using 3/8 oz, perhaps I need to drop down in weight a bit, guess I'll have to stop in and see Gerry later today.  I did get quite a few hits on the grub, 3 solid hits two of which actually bit the grub right off just short of the hook  so that is encouraging and a lot of what I think might have been perch or rock bass hits, tap tap tap but no hook set. Might have to come down a little in hook size too.  Most of the action seemed to be in about 10-12 FOW just off the edges of the weeds, boy are the weeds ever getting thick out there now.  Anyway it was a beautiful evening out on the water."
475014,jat,2010-06-12 13:59:00,138,keep at er Cliff............next time I'm up there I'll see if I can sneak around with the canoe and catch a walleye.....haven't caught one yet this year.
475034,Harrison,2010-06-12 14:50:00,2202, Maybe try the below Cliff.  Heading into the weedline a couple feet...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=42144&hl=harrison&st=0
475036,The Urban Fisherman,2010-06-12 14:55:00,2050,"Cliff I have nothin' for ya!  If I knew the lake I'd be all over it but I don't know it from a whole in the ground.  Some good ppl on here helpin' you out.  Best wishes in the future. Can't wait to read a successful report from you!  cheers, Ryan"
473972,Big Cliff,2010-06-09 10:05:00,6899,"Well, last Saturday, armed with some secret techniques and a honey hole or two that some of you so kindly provided by PM, I headed out to try to catch a walleye. 4 hours of fishing not a single fish landed, in fact not even one on and lost.  Sunday morning it was raining and blowing like crazy but by noon the rain had stopped so away I went again. When we got out onto lake there were waves 4+' high, the boat is safe enough but that is just plain uncomfortable so I decided to head up the river toward Lindsay. Tried trolling, bouncing twister tails rip jigging, 3 more hours, not one fish.  Last night, I got home from work, had an early supper, grabbed a can of Ice tea and headed out, I was on the water by 5:30. Conditions couldn't have been better, a light breeze, a slight chop on the water, a wisp of cloud to the West, just enough to shade the sun. I headed out to a secret honey hole that someone had kindly shared with me. I did everything but empty my tackle box into the lake. Everything from 3' to 14' of water, weed beds to weed edges, 3 hours, 1 rock bass.  I finally decided to finish off the evening back over here in Goose Bay, I think I might have had one hit that felt like it could have been a walleye but that was it, I finally packed it in at 9:30 and came home empty handed AGAIN!  Now I have to tell you I have a lot of tackle and I recently purchased a whole lot more based on some of the reports I had gotten. I now own so many bucktails that I actually had to add a whole new tray to my tackle box, and if I don't have $750.00 worth of plastics and just about every colour of jig head they make I'll be surprised. That doesn't even come close to the number or trolling lures, worm harneses, and other odds and ends. Believe me, I have been trying them all!  To top it all off I'm still getting reports from other members of 20 fish catches in 2 hours. Kids limiting out, secret spots where you can almost walk on the fish they are so thick. Anyone got any CIL wobblers they would like to part with?  So, I need a goat, a cow, a pig, a chicken, and a virgin to sacrifice to the fishing gods (Ok maybe not the virgin, I'll just take her fishing with me  ). I don't know what I've done to anger the fishing gods but it sure must have been a doozie."
473977,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-09 10:47:00,1183, Today is your lucky day - that would be me!
473979,Big Cliff,2010-06-09 11:00:00,6899," Now you do realize I did say ""I would take a virgin fishing"" I didn't say anything about bringing a virgin home home again!!!"
473980,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-09 11:05:00,1183,  Not quite.....you said you would sacrifice a virgin     I just saw the word virgin and had to come forward....sorry about that.
473982,Big Cliff,2010-06-09 11:18:00,6899," That's OK sweetheart, story of my life LOL."
473985,mr blizzard,2010-06-09 11:42:00,1589,"Big Cliff, I have tried the virgin thing too, and   and even that didn't work  . Last year I finally broke down and bought one from the store! (pickerel). As my son called it it was the walk of shame. Buying it instead of catching it.  The sad part was he fried it up and ate the whole thing before I got a chance at even the cheeks. Some day we should fish together and break the streak."
473987,John,2010-06-09 11:53:00,2956," Let me know when you have a free day or two Cliff. We will bring the cow, pig, chicken and holy water. My supply of virgins has dwindled over the years though. PM me or e-mail me and let me know. We can exhaust my many tackle boxes, they don't work too well either. Be well my friend!"
473988,Teressa,2010-06-09 11:59:00,55,"Well Dad, we could always do a community ""potluck"" sacrifice, I've got the goat!"
473990,solopaddler,2010-06-09 12:03:00,8605, You must be one of them thar born again virgins!  Hey wait a minute...come to think of it I'm a virgin too.   (Cliff one day it'll all come together for you I'm sure of it)
473992,Roy,2010-06-09 12:11:00,13728,See dad? Teressa's got the goat. Now all we need is a broom handle and a dwarf!
473995,bigugli,2010-06-09 12:17:00,6138,"I think this man needs an intervention, quick.  Out of the depths of your despair, the fishing gods will hear your cries and you will be redeemed.  Failing that, you may need to ""medicate"" yourself to ease the pain."
474002,Harrison,2010-06-09 12:44:00,2202,"Ok, enough of this Cliff.  What are you doing Sunday afternoon?  I'll see what I can swing."
474003,Raf,2010-06-09 12:49:00,3495,there's gotta be a banana stuffed somewhere in the boat.
474011,davew3,2010-06-09 13:17:00,430,"Cliff,  is Gannons Narrows within reach for you?   If you can get there drift it with mr twisters tipped with leaches or minnows.  Good luck."
474014,Beans,2010-06-09 13:26:00,3339, Cliff would have to go through the locks at Bobcaygeon...Pick Nanook (Jack) and me up on the north shore of Pigeon Lake then head down the back channel to the narrows...  Sounds good to me...
474046,Garnet,2010-06-09 14:18:00,2056,"I have very few super superstitions. Did you store your rod and reel near your gas tank....................... that's bad real bad. Remove all line wash rod and reel and re line.  One time I bought cheap sunscreen and got skunk 2 weekends in a row. Berkly later came out with some chemical ""starts with T@^%$**&^"" that's bad real bad.  Get cleaning up your equipment it will change your frame on mind."
474047,fish-miester,2010-06-09 14:21:00,864,good idea. I think im gunna hit up your body of water again today and try my luck I will let you know if i find them (walleye)
474131,aplumma,2010-06-09 19:17:00,6896,Cliff  If you need some help on your fishin I will gladly give you lessons Sat. on how to fish Southern Style up at Lak Air.   Art  O BTW pick up about a half a pound of alligator tail for bait please.
474134,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-09 19:32:00,0,"If I didn't have a job Interview I would come fish with you Cliff! But it looks like you got professional help with Harrison. Maybe you are using too thick of a line? Try 6 pound mono!! A bright jig head with a white or smoked twister. Cast it out and drag bottom stop, drag bottom, stop. Sometime I pick them up when I am hopping the lure across the bottom. Look for deep weed edges and cast away!"
474136,fishnsled,2010-06-09 19:37:00,3520,"Cliff - you are really on a pattern. The consistency is amazing (amazingly mind boggling) I wish I had some idea's for you but by the sounds of what you are doing, I'd be doing the same. Sounds like you have some good offers here. I may hit you lake on Sunday with my old man. I'll pm you if we are going and maybe jump in with us for the day. Change of venue might be all you need to get things going."
474154,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-09 20:12:00,0,"I forgot. The easiest thing to use for pickerel are Rapala shad raps(jointed preferably)in a natural pattern like a minnow or even better perch since that is what they feed on in Sturgeon. Just fan cast all along the weed edges early morning, late evening when they are most active."
474178,Roy,2010-06-09 21:38:00,13728,"Oh Cliff my good friend....what are you cooking up now? For those of you who don't know, Cliff guided in the French River area for years...he knows his stuff no matter what water he's on. So this is the question... what are you up to Cliff?"
474182,Sinker,2010-06-09 21:45:00,8692,"Cliff, I was out there today musky fishing. Got two musky, 41"" and 37"". Also got 4 walleye casting musky spinnerbaits. My buddy that was  with me caught a couple more eyes on a hammered silver wormharness, tipped with a berkely powerbait leech.  We were almost within shouting distance of your house. Definitly within eyesight of your front window!!!! I don't know what your doing wrong my friend.  I think it might be your new boat that's cursed??  S."
474184,Beans,2010-06-09 21:52:00,3339,  There you go Cliff...time to fish off your dock in the evenings with a lighted bobber and minnow...secret weapon from past years not working?
474189,Ron,2010-06-09 22:00:00,1683,I wish I had time to take you out as well Cliff but unfortunately I won't be able to until mid July.
