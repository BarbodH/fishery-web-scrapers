As you can see in the pic i have had enough of the weather getting the best of me while on the water, problem is casting while bass fishing. My neighbor has an old diving board and the van door still works so i was thinking of mounting it on the side of the boat and use it as a casting deck...do you think it will work or be too tipsy.  Going to be a sweet rig for trolling though. "
474247,livinisfishin,2010-06-10 00:42:00,661,Lol that is sweet! How wide is the diving board and how long?
474251,Twocoda,2010-06-10 00:49:00,4130,Heres your sign!!!!!!!!!!!!LMAO....funny ...thanks ...just made my day..  Do the brakelights still work???
474255,Nipfisher,2010-06-10 01:04:00,2449,Casting deck...just cut a hatch in the roof. lol.
474261,Black_Blade,2010-06-10 01:14:00,258,Too funny...does the signal lights still work?
474265,Fisherman,2010-06-10 01:17:00,7201,"First I have to ask,  is this an optical illusion, an old van body on the boat?  If so, has it ever been on the water and how tippy is the rig when things get a bit rough?  That's a whole lot of weight above the waterline."
474346,OhioFisherman,2010-06-10 08:06:00,6623,"LMAO, windshield wipers work? Always hated wearing a motorcycle helmet at 70mph in the rain. Not very streamlined though, don`t think you could get enough motors on that ride to hit 70 mph.  What part of west virginia are you from?"
474868,IndySKS,2010-06-11 21:15:00,134,West Virginia ? man you are harsh...lol
