474777,Gman,2010-06-11 12:50:00,126,"For the complete package of service, even after sales, pricing and pure knowledge I would give Jocelyn a call at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock @ 519-539-5494 and tell him Gavin told you to call.  He knows me well  better than I would like my wife to know  Cheers, G."

474779,Syn,2010-06-11 12:54:00,519,"radioworld.ca check prices, call BPS to compare. If its only a few bucks difference then Radioworld.ca all the way. Great service from them. Pretty sure you could price match with RadioWorld anyhow."

GPS's , fishfinders, VHF radio, service and pricing keeps me going back. As well as the location. Heard some good things about Angling Outfitters but just not as close for me to get there."
