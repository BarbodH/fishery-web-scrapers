474263,Twocoda,2010-06-10 01:15:00,4130,its not very common ...but im going to guess its a doe button
474264,camillj,2010-06-10 01:17:00,1988,Sombrero ???
474268,vinnimon,2010-06-10 01:21:00,2593,  It was once worn by Speedy Gonzales
474273,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-10 01:28:00,0,  I was gonna say it's looks like it might be from one of those queer deer.
474363,dave524,2010-06-10 12:23:00,4508,"its from a male fawn, google  ""button buck""."
474581,misfish,2010-06-10 22:34:00,29133,Good call Dave.  How the heck did you stumble onto that?
474587,Handlebarz,2010-06-10 22:39:00,3790,As for score I was going to say tree 1 deer 0 but when I saw the pics I had no clue so I will not say Tree 1 deer 0 and just agree with Dave and our resident game trail camera guy miss I mean Brian.

474647,farsider,2010-06-11 01:27:00,456,"  Actually, when I was first walking up to it, I thought I had found a replacement for one of my Dad's old ceramic toy cowboy hats that had broken (sorry Dad.)  I just came across it when I was out walking on Sunday.  I have never seen one like this before.  It is incredibly smooth at the base with none of the usual bubbled crowning.  Cheers,  Mark"
474649,richyb,2010-06-11 01:31:00,774,is it hollow ?
474749,ChrisK,2010-06-11 09:35:00,2772,"Yup,button buck with a little deformity. Pretty common amongst deer..Ive got a couple good oddballs around here that I can snap a few pics of and post later after work if I can remember..."
