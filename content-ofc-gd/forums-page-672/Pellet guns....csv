Although the CCC states a minimum velocity/sec, the municipalities create their own and include specific definitions such as Longbow, Xbow, etc...Pellet guns..etc.  Take a look at Section # 2, subsection # 5 under definitions...  Unless your part of the exemptions in Section # 5, I think you outta luck. "
