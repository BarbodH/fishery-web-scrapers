474398,Harrison,2010-06-10 14:57:00,2202,We have the title!  Longest drought without the CUP!  Special kudos to the Leaf management staff for selling out every game and still being one of the highest revenue earners while chasing this prestigious title!
474409,anders,2010-06-10 15:34:00,1168,"Thats awesome...i just hope they continue to produce crap on the ice for another 50 years, while still contributing to my wife's retirement!"
474410,solopaddler,2010-06-10 15:35:00,8605,  Actually Phil you're incorrect. The Leafs are tied with both the Kings and Blues now for the longest cup drought. 42 years and counting.  They've got a ways to go to best the record. I believe the Rangers went 54 years before winning in '94.
474415,Harrison,2010-06-10 15:45:00,2202, Thanks Mike.  Without researching I wonder if the leafs revenue is the same or more then the other 2 teams combined.
474429,Harrison,2010-06-10 16:15:00,2202," Thanks Sinclair,  Leafs - $168 Million - 29th place Kings - $92 Million - 9th place Blues - $80 Million - 15th place  Capitals - $83 Million - 1st place  Rebuild, rebuild, rebuild.... why would they?"
474431,canadadude,2010-06-10 16:19:00,769,Oh boy!!! that takes some of the sting out of it for Leaf fans hahahahahaha
474435,alexcba,2010-06-10 16:27:00,634,arrgggg this is exactly why i wanted philly to win lol. aww well go phanuefs go! lol
474471,uglyfish,2010-06-10 17:41:00,981," actually, the kings and blues have never won a cup... so its not really a drought. AND if u wanna get really technical, the kings and blues began play in the NHL in the fall of 1967, the leafs won the cup in the spring of 1967... so they still have a few months on top of the kings and blues. lol"
474485,otter649,2010-06-10 18:16:00,118,   At least The Kings & The Blues have made the Cup Finals since 1967 - The Leafs not.......
474496,solopaddler,2010-06-10 18:41:00,8605,  Semantics
474659,John Bacon,2010-06-11 02:02:00,3277,Look on the bright side; the last Chicago cup win was followed by three consecutive Leaf cups... they say that history repeats itself.
474689,Oktravis,2010-06-11 02:44:00,62,go leafs!!
474723,Gerritt,2010-06-11 04:05:00,6129,.....
474736,bigugli,2010-06-11 05:00:00,6138, Dreamer. Nothin but a dreamer.......
474750,crappieperchhunter,2010-06-11 09:37:00,2582,  Whatever meds you are on....I want some
474769,bow slayer,2010-06-11 12:28:00,1074,we will all see god before the leafs see the cup!!!!!!  The Kings will also be the next Chicago......cup coming soon.
474783,wankerjohn123,2010-06-11 13:07:00,117,Toronto....... Naaaaaaa.
474805,Flappn,2010-06-11 15:41:00,245,Leafs - $168 Million and no cup = the reason I never and won't buy leaf ticket's or Leaf's crap.
474934,Dave Bailey,2010-06-12 02:52:00,1641,I understand that the Leafs are soon going to unveil new uniforms. Here's a different idea - keep the old uniforms and fill them with hockey players. Just a thought.  Actually I think that four things are more likely to happen in the world of sport before Toronto wins another Stanley Cup:  1) Soccer fans will collectively be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  2) Cleveland will erect a statue honouring Art Modell  3) The Washington Generals will be crowned NBA champions  4) Brooklyn will declare a Walter O'Malley appreciation day  Thank you and good night.
