474930,pike n' whities,2010-06-12 02:38:00,131,"my second report!   fishin was alright towards the evening.... which is when my luck usually hits me. started off with a 9lbs pike that we lost boat-side. carried on with 2 walleye. once again, nothin special. biggest 17"" smallest 16"" which is usually the average for the lake. 40+ inch pike in that lake though! but the action wasnt too hot in the north end. I dont have a fish finder yet so we just trolled with some worm harnesses for a spot to jig. changed colours a few times, the orange with black dot 2 blade 3 hook harness seemed to be the ticket cause I was the only one catchin the buggers. were there from about 10:00 - 7:00 (late start cause of weather). talked to a couple fellas who were fishin the south end and they werent there for longer than 4 hours and got their combined limit of 8 by jigging with minnows and worms by a weed line. but of course it helped that they had a fish finder. in all a fun day though. Enjoy the pics. like I said nothin special lol.  north end of the lake (some of it)   trolling grounds (some of it lol)   the fish.... x2 oh and the pic was taken just after gutting them and gettin them ready for transport.   Just gettin into town. "
