474170,Pangle,2010-06-09 21:06:00,64,"Hello all I want to introduce myself being new to this forum.  I have visited this site in the past and find it well managed and very informative.  I enjoy fishing for all species with a focus on bass and steelhead.  I have read some amazing postings and hope to share my experiences (including pics) with you.  The past few years fishing has been very limited due to my young children, however my boy will be 3 this summer and I can't want to take him out! Good fishing everyone."
