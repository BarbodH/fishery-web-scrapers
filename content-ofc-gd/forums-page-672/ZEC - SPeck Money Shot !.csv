474220,Fish Farmer,2010-06-09 23:44:00,2234,"Looks like a very nice trip, beauty pictures and nice speckle. Thanks for posting. My guess 21 1/2"""
474224,camillj,2010-06-09 23:49:00,1988,OK ... I admit to the long-arm technique ... but it came out fabulously .. dont ya think...  And no .. that was not me in the video ... I was the voice behind the video... Wayne has it right ... Scotch all the way for me ... that was most certainly a Beer aided episode (of course the driver was 100% sober)  ... although I believe a bottle of Belvanie was involved as a prelude ... and so far the weight of 2lbs is actually the closest ...
474235,camillj,2010-06-10 00:20:00,1988,By the way .. we have two spots open for our August trip ....
474638,trevy727,2010-06-11 00:55:00,351, 2.2 lbs?

474895,glen,2010-06-12 00:50:00,2641,Great report.  If only i had longer arms.
473827,camillj,2010-06-08 23:24:00,1988,So instead of a long drawn out report ... I thought I'd post a couple of shots that would speak for themselves .. and then .. of course the money shot ... prize to the first guy who guesses the actual size and length of the fish - no trick photography .. at least no tricks we dont all use  Pretty views of the Mountain lake at our little camp ...       A little Barbeque with the Boys ...    A little Vino ...    Long Long night .. and the morning after ...     All the boys (at least the boys would could be there this weekend ...       And of course the money shot ....
