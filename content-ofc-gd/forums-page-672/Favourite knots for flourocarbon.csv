475267,siwash,2010-06-13 12:50:00,683,"Hey folks,  I am tinkering with knots this morning and I am wondering what your favourite knot is for tying floro leader line to terminal tackle (swivels, etc) or when tying directly to a lure like a spoon or crankbait?  I have used polamar knots and even uni knots..  Thoughts?"
475269,Jer,2010-06-13 13:23:00,1426,"Whenever it's practical, I like to use a palomar knot. It's virtually impossible to slip and it's easy to tie. It's a bulky knot, especially with large dia line. If that's an issue, the uni or improved cinch (but not with braid) are good options."
475276,siwash,2010-06-13 14:10:00,683," Ya, nothing beats a palomar for ease and strength. I was curious if there were other good ones out there that might be even stronger..."
475287,Syn,2010-06-13 15:17:00,519,"Depends on your lure: for crankbait or lures that have a wobble action, a loop type knot gives the lure the freedom to dance.  A good tip I saw on a fishing show: while searching for fish eg bass using crankbaits/ spinnerbaits and switching frequently use a snap then after you learn what they are biting on, get rid of the snap and tie directly. I'm waiting for my decoy egg snap #2  Tying directly to say a punch skirt with a 1/2oz-1oz weight flipping and pitching, snell knot seems popular http://www.tackletou...punchskirt.html because when pulling, it causes the hook to pivot into the fish improving hookups.  for tying to a swivel I'm not totally decided yet, I want a small knot that does use up too much line while tying it and minimizes friction when tightening up. doubled line through the eye seems to be on the strongest knots though.   If you're really interested check out knot wars videos 2009-2010 http://www.fishingcl.../knot-wars-2010  but cross reference the results with their pdf http://www.fishingcl...202009_2010.pdf   Also depends on how thick the flouro. For pike muskie leaders80 lb+, some of those knots are incredibly hard.  I'm going to experiment with the triple loop http://www.fishingcl...-wars-episode-4 for direct tying flouro with no loop for worming and tying to swivel and see how that goes. I've used this knot all of last year, and never broke at the knot with flouro http://www.youtube.c...h?v=OGZ8SBI8sGI  I tie a similar knot to above for braid and its crazy strong."

475321,Garry2Rs,2010-06-13 17:28:00,1425,"IMO the Palomar is great for hooks, jigs, and flies but a royal pain when you have to maneuver the loop over a lure.  For lures I like the Uni tied by going through the line-tie or eye twice.  This version is AKA the Fishing Fool.  It is a very strong knot which even beat the Palomar on TV...  I don't like terminal tackle so seldom use swivels or snaps.  However, when I do I use these items I use the same two knots.  On heavy leaders, like 50 or 100 pound test, these knots are too bulky.  I use the Homer Rhodes Knot.  It's only 50% to 70% line strength, but I'm using that line for it's diameter, as bite-off insurance.  As far as knot strength goes, even a 50 pound fish can pull anywhere near 50 pounds... Garry2R's"
475322,Snidley,2010-06-13 17:41:00,620,"I know that the host of the TV program Fishfull Thinking, Charlie Wray(who is sponsored by Seagar)calls for a uni knot for connecting fluro to a split ring. The Palomar is ok for snap, snap swivels and other single strand connectors but the uni is best for o rings. Personally i have gotten into the habit of using the uni knot on all connectors and I'm very pleased with the obvious(to me) strength and ease of tying a perfect knot every time when using the uni."
475326,houski,2010-06-13 17:59:00,61,"Here are the knots that I use in different situations. I know there are many knots out there, and many that will do the job. The following are just my preferences.  For tying lighter flouro (less than 50lb), I like to use the back to back uni, just make sure to make a few more wraps in your smaller diameter braid.  For tying larger diameter flouro (60+ lb) I like to tye the triple surgeon's loop. I find that it is easier to get tight. I used to tie the back to back uni, but I find that it's hard to get the 100+ lb flouro tight enough not to slip.  For tying flouro to snaps, I use the palomar on smaller diameter flouro, and the uni on large diameter flouro.   I only tie swivels to my bucktail muskie rod, and I use the San Diego Jam knot to tie the braid, and the uni on the flouro side."
