Almost every time I'm out I've had a big pike either steal or take a bite out of a walleye that I'm reeling in. A couple of times I've had the pike with a foot of shore still hanging on to my eye. Im wanting to target the pike more now so im looking for suggestions... There are some bigger pike in the water because the one day I got a good look at him when he tried to take a bite out of my 23"" eye.  Any help is welcome."

I've caught a ton of Musky on them and you already know your Pike likes Walleye...If you're more into live/dead bait, google ""Quick Strike Rig"" and cast a big sucker or other large minnow.  I have seen big minnows rigged this way fished under large bobbers too. Garry2R's"
