474973,Teressa,2010-06-12 11:00:00,55,"Dad, you're right, I'm going to like this board LOL ...fellow conspirators, this is going to be fun. I don't know if I will get down to the get together with Dad, and every child knows not to outfish their parents otherwise, they will be tossed overboard. Dad tried it last year even without me outfishing him, he pushed me right off his dock, of course he went into the water as well and I made sure he hit the water first. So I think I get a freebie."

474615,Teressa,2010-06-10 23:51:00,55,"Hello everyone, Just thought I would jump in and introduce myself as well. I am ""Big Cliff's"" daughter. I grew up in the French River area hunting and fishing. I have raised my daughter to be a fisher-woman as well and we go every chance we get.  My boyfriend, daughter and I have a farm in Wahnapitae with a variety of animals including goats, wild turkeys, rabbits and muskovey ducks. I am looking forward to getting to know everyone here. Thanks Dad for refering me to this site, and thanks Roy for helping me to get activated."

I met your dad a few years back while fishin just off his dock .. and replied (via my blackberry) to an ad he posted about a 9.9hp  for sale ... you shoulda seen the look on the owner's face when I returned his boat rental later that day and took an outboard from the boat into my car ... I can just bet what he musta thought  Anyhow ... you'll enjoy this place .. lots of fine folk and plenty of hard/soft water trash-talk  Jon.
474886,Teressa,2010-06-11 23:30:00,55,"Thank you all for the warm welcome. If I ever say anything anyone takes offense to, feel free to steal some of Dad's spots, I'd say you can slap him for it, but well, that wouldn't be very nice of me . Seriously though I look forward to getting to know you and read your posts and contribute where I can. At the very least, I'll be able to pick up some good info for blackmailing Dad."
