474803,alexcba,2010-06-11 15:36:00,634,anyone know a place around the GTA that still sells these? i used to have a set and they were incredible in the nottawasaga and heavy vegged lakes for pike and bass. was wondering if anyone knew where i could get some without having to order in from the states.
474806,lookinforwalleye,2010-06-11 15:44:00,4399, There is one for sale on Kijji.
474808,alexcba,2010-06-11 15:47:00,634, got the add number by chance?  EDIT: never mind i found it  thanks for the heads up.
474812,wask,2010-06-11 16:07:00,174,Saw them at Bass Pro last week.  I have a friend who still swears by them.  He has fished them since we were teenagers and he catches lots of fish on them so you can't argue with the results.   
474815,JMahon,2010-06-11 16:15:00,48,I actually saw a few Banjo Minnow kits at Wal-Mart the other day....maybe you should see if your store has them as well!
474817,alexcba,2010-06-11 16:17:00,634," lol i clearly am not getting out enough.. i keep going to tackle shops rather than big stores, thanks for the heads up guys, i'll check it all out. hope they have that new 006 minnow.. looks pretty good."
