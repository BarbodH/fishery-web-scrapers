475002,siwash,2010-06-12 13:21:00,683,"I use AMS OIL for my 2 stroke outboards, but it's expensive! What do you folks use?"
475005,fish_fishburn,2010-06-12 13:24:00,1311,Amsoil. you know the old saying.....Pay now or pay later.
475006,Terry,2010-06-12 13:26:00,14456,K-Y
475016,Burtess,2010-06-12 14:04:00,901, I didn't know that was synthetic... I thought it was water-based?  Burt
475018,Terry,2010-06-12 14:09:00,14456,Oh Oh  I thought it was SIN-thetic   SIN-thetic   I got a million of them
475019,siwash,2010-06-12 14:11:00,683, You're a disgusting pig!  
475021,siwash,2010-06-12 14:12:00,683,  Do you really think there's tht much difference? I wonder what makes it so good?
475023,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-12 14:17:00,10439,Opti 2 for me.
475027,siwash,2010-06-12 14:29:00,683,  Is that a synthetic oil? where can u get it?
475028,Terry,2010-06-12 14:30:00,14456,"I don't know what makes Amsoil so good  but after you put it in and you find you need to turn the idle down because it runs faster on the same gas setting and you find the running temperature drops, you know it's good for the motor"
475029,siwash,2010-06-12 14:33:00,683,"  Hmm, interesting..  The specific one I buy (black container) says it's made for snowmobiles and PWC. Not specifically for outboards."
475038,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-06-12 15:04:00,0,amsoil.  my sled likes it's powervalve formula as well.
475041,Dara,2010-06-12 15:08:00,3052,  And 2 strokes it it eh
475042,fish_fishburn,2010-06-12 15:09:00,1311,"I don't know what makes Amsoil so good. But I have been running it in my V6 Merc for 10 yrs and my motor has never seen a mechanic, except for general maintenance. Water pump impellars, and head gaskets every 5 yrs. And the motor is still very strong."
475046,scugpg,2010-06-12 15:50:00,1373,"I ran Amsoil HPI Injector oil in my 2 stroke and now run Synthetic in my 4 Stroke.  Also use the Amsoil Synthetic Marine Gear Lube for the bottom ends, as well as the Marine grease.  http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/hpi.aspx - 2 Stroke Injector http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/wcf.aspx - 4 Stroke 10W40 http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/agm.aspx - Gear Lube http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/gwr.aspx - Marine Grease"
475047,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-12 15:54:00,10439,"  Yep, it's a full synthetic that comes in 2 stroke mix, 2 stroke injector and 4 stroke versions.  Opti 2 & Opti 4 Oils  I purchase mine at a local store, Ron's automotive but you can shoot off an email or call the manufacturer for a list of local dealers.  The stuff isn't cheap but it works great. It costs me $55 gal for injector oil here in Yellowknife."
475049,irishfield,2010-06-12 15:59:00,26272,My favourite FULL synthetic... is the one that stays sitting on a store shelf ! (but of course you already knew that.... )
475055,Sinker,2010-06-12 16:52:00,8692,My two stroke has been burning cheap ass oil for the last 17 years with no problems. I'm not sold on synthetic. I also run dyno oil in my turbo car engine. I can't justify paying more for the same results.  S.
475059,scugpg,2010-06-12 17:19:00,1373,  I noticed a significant reduction in smoke when I switched to Amsoil.  I totally understand trying to justify the extra $
475103,Sinker,2010-06-12 19:09:00,8692,"I burn the manufacturers reccomended oil in my mariner. Its smokes at first start up, but its not bad once she's running. I use the Merc oil.  S."
475128,splashhopper,2010-06-12 20:43:00,2931, I thought that was a jelly
475170,fish_fishburn,2010-06-13 00:20:00,1311,"Sinker, for the price of the Merc oil you might as well switch to Amsoil its cheaper and a better product."
475185,Muskieman,2010-06-13 00:55:00,2472,As much as the smoke reduced and the price tripled when I went from the Shell Nautilus.. to Amsoil my plugs last longer..... and when I went from Amsoil to Royal Purple  the smoke is even less and the plugs stay the same....  RFS 
475187,pikeguy,2010-06-13 01:03:00,195, Well thanks for the info randy was contemplating the change i use the Shell Nautilus and now i got some info from others as well  thanks
