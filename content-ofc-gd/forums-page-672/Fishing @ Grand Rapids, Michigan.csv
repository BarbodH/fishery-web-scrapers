474936,okumasheffield,2010-06-12 03:09:00,318,happened to be @ Grand Rapids this week due to work at the last minute. I was completely shocked when noticing some tackle shops while driving by.  I am going back again next week and am wondering fishing related information such as tackle shops and river fishing access points  Thanks
