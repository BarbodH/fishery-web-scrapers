555944,atvaholic,2011-02-27 15:41:00,271," Doubt i'll be able to get out ice fishing, but I am definatly going to get me a large bow to see how it does."
555955,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-27 15:55:00,1107,"Nice reel I was considering it but I think I will put in a few more bucks and get a sahara and a citica I was playing with both at the london show and these ""lower end"" reels have improved by leeps and bounds over a few years ago the citica feels as good as my 3 year old curado's and the sahara is a better reel than my white and gold stratic ever was IMO"
556317,JohnF,2011-02-28 15:22:00,3494,Got one of those last summer. Only got to use it a few times before the docs strapped me to a bed but I liked everything about it except the price of spare reels. Looking forward to trying it on other rods this summer for different applications. Only had it on the Cumara that I bought but I suspect it will feel pretty darned good on some other rods too.  JF
556319,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-28 15:26:00,3761,Nice reel....I have handled both Stradics 10 times now and just can't decide what one I want to buy in a week or two
556478,Live2fish85,2011-02-28 23:44:00,1633,I used the Stradic CI4 last year and it was awesome I am going to be getting one soon as well. Best reel I have used for a spinning rod yet.
556494,solopaddler,2011-03-01 00:18:00,8605,Nice reel bud. I'm guessing it'll get a good workout May 4-8?  What rod will you put it on?
556549,atvaholic,2011-03-01 02:37:00,271,"Hey solopadler, you got that right! Im dying to try it on my Fenwick HMXS 105XL-2R HMX Steelhead Spin Rod 10'6"".  Problem is lugging that through the trails...but I love that rod. Maybe i'll try it on my lightning rod and see how it feels!"
556554,solopaddler,2011-03-01 02:53:00,8605,"  Right on, have fun with it!"
