555825,bucktail,2011-02-27 01:25:00,1857,"Purchased a barely used Stella of the net for a great price, the reel is in IMACULATE shape, now I am wondering what i should match it up with. It's a 2500ar , does anyone have any experience with the new Loomis NRX's? I want it to be my light jigging-plastics rod running 4-8 pound line on it. Any suggestions?   Darren"

555868,John Bacon,2011-02-27 03:59:00,3277, You could always match it up with me.
555873,danc,2011-02-27 04:32:00,4677,Put it in a glass case with an alarm.
555876,Bondar,2011-02-27 04:40:00,817,buy the GLX 4-8 in the classifieds from Spiel if i didnt already have that rod i would have that one with me i love that rod
555881,BillM,2011-02-27 04:56:00,17367, LOL!!!

555886,Cudz,2011-02-27 06:17:00,2652,7' ugly stik.  that rod makes every good combo a great combo
555887,thebigcatch,2011-02-27 06:37:00,138,NRX rods are very nice and with a stella it with be a WOW I love this lol
555900,bubbles,2011-02-27 12:24:00,591,I was confused why you didn't want to drink your stella....
555913,danbouck,2011-02-27 13:45:00,4380,"The only rod good enough for that is a Spiel rod, otherwise I agree with DanC"
555916,GregF2,2011-02-27 14:00:00,46,I have that same Stella and have it paired with a Loomis GLX medium.  Great combo!
555960,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-27 16:10:00,3761,"Use it for a lithger setup like your thinking. 8lb fluoro or light braid would be sick with that reel.  Nice reel, share a pic of the setup when you choose a rod, can't beat a high end St Croix"
