556128,Billy Bob,2011-02-27 23:48:00,5865,Many of us work tough and or dangerous jobs.....be thankful you went home to your family when the work day was over.......  Maybe it's time to put this thread to bed.....
556133,vinnimon,2011-02-28 00:13:00,2593,  Probably the same rookie that was disciplined after my little go threw an amber light episode. He made a 6yr old cry and peed off his elders in the force on the same morning
556157,brifishrgy,2011-02-28 01:55:00,559,  yup
556170,solopaddler,2011-02-28 02:27:00,8605,So....how 'bout them Leafs?
556171,fishing n autograph,2011-02-28 02:29:00,2540,They blew it again!
556180,Dozer,2011-02-28 02:54:00,896," Pfffft, their job is easy and safe!"
556203,cwpowell,2011-02-28 03:31:00,265,"Well, I got my girlfriend to her job safely, and after all, if that copper stopped me a minute later or earlier I could have been in a horrible crash. Im thanking him for giving me the lowest of my 3 possible fines. And I deserve it. I'm the one who messed up.  Thanks for all the responses y'all.  By the way, I am trying to become a cop, rather police officer."
555990,Billy Bob,2011-02-27 17:37:00,5865,Along with the fishing rods I'll have to leave some guns in the truck in case the officer is just a hunter....
556001,Grimace,2011-02-27 17:57:00,2020,"Cops let each other off with everything.  Drunk driving included.  All I ever hear about is how dangerous it is to be a cop.  A construction worker is 8 times more likely to be killed at work than a cop.  I thought that was an interesting stat. It was given at a yearly job site safety meeting done by the Construction Safety Association of Ontario.  The only people the Ministry of Labour ""let off"" is the companies that endanger the worker.  I should have become a cop.  Clean drivers abstract for life. Safe working environment (well, 8 times safer than mine is).   Less travel.  Job security, and a public sympathy card that can be played anytime.  Aloha"
556012,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 18:31:00,2540,Yeah... I recently learned that people are joining MMA clubs to train to hurt and kill construction workers.....  And cops get done up all the time. Just because you don't know about doesn't mean it doesn't happen
556014,Grimace,2011-02-27 18:47:00,2020,"This mma club thing is more of the propaganda machine.  It is a bargaining chip so you guys can get paid overtime to work out after the shift ends.  Cops only get ""done up"" if the screw up is so bad that it can't be hidden."
556015,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 18:51:00,2540,Wow...propaganda machine...
556017,Grimace,2011-02-27 18:58:00,2020,"Yes.  According to cops there are legions and hordes of dope dealing gangsters joining mma clubs with drug money in order to hurt cops.  Hahahaha.  As you hinted with tour sarcastic comment about them joining clubs to hurt construction workers.  Anyways,  last time I was on the 407 I saw a yorky and an opp racing each other and laughing, and weaving in and out of traffic.  They were like 25 years old. If your a civilian that is called street racing.  There is no chance in hell that those two punks would ever get ""done up""."
556018,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 19:10:00,2540,"Really, because that yorkie is now riding the pine at the crc for that...big brother watches us"
556019,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 19:11:00,2540,Discipline is not made public contrary to popular demand
556020,Grimace,2011-02-27 19:14:00,2020,Good to hear.  Big brother needs to watch cops. I bet he is still getting paid.  That's what riding the pine means right? Suspended with pay?  A little different than the rest of us.
556021,Grimace,2011-02-27 19:17:00,2020, It should be.  But I guess there is not enough paper to print it all.  And we couldn't have the citizenry losing even more respect for their city's finest.
556022,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 19:21:00,2540,Same reason why not every person that is arrested and charged has their name made public
556023,Grimace,2011-02-27 19:34:00,2020,"So I take it he is getting paid?  It takes big brother to nab cops because they cover up each others crime. So the fact that cops are getting ""done up"" provides me with no solace as my point on the good old boys club remains as valid as ever."
556032,Mattitude,2011-02-27 19:46:00,155, Amen brother!
556037,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 20:00:00,2540,"Yes, but what he got is worse than the speeding ticket the average citizen would have got. He lost a part of his paycheque and a charge that will stay on his permanent record and something that will e brought up every time he goes to court"
556038,fishermccann,2011-02-27 20:02:00,655,Yes I  will go call a contruction worker when I am in trouble .Get real.
556041,Grimace,2011-02-27 20:05:00,2020,"A citizen would have lost their car, got a brutal fine and a mark on their record for every time they went to court and would have to lose parts of many paychecks fighting the ticket and years of insurance turmoil."
556044,Grimace,2011-02-27 20:11:00,2020," Not the point.  The point I was making with that line of discourse is this.  Cops talk as if they are in the midst if a great and dangerous war every day when the fact of the matter is this, they are in a lot less danger than let's say for example (my example) a construction worker. Whe a construction worker gets killed some rich guy gets a small fine and when something happens to a cop the city gets a fevered bloodlust for revenge.  And if you want to have a heart attack anywhere,  try having one near a jobsite because most construction workers will CPR you back to life before the ambulance gets there."
556055,fishermccann,2011-02-27 20:33:00,655,"Cops deal with scum , construction workers deal with inanimate objects that don't fight back. You can refuse to work  an unsafe jobsite."
556056,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 20:34:00,2540,"Funny...I didn't know on construction sites you get punched, spat on, attacked, driven at by cars, hit by cars, called every name in the book for doing your job and then having people tell you you're no good and corrupt...if you don't believe me head to east beaver creek or luxys on a friday/saturday night. I'm sure the people that walk by construction sites don't try to test their man hood by taking a swing at you.... this sounds like the guy last week on am640 saying that being a taxi driver was more dangerous than being a cop..."
556062,Dozer,2011-02-27 20:45:00,896,"Whatever! Perch have it the worst!  Police have easy jobs, in Toronto they stand around construction sites and get paid good money for it!"
556063,Mattitude,2011-02-27 20:46:00,155, You are quickly becoming my hero
556065,lew,2011-02-27 20:47:00,12766,"A lot of people work in dangerous jobs, but arguing who has the MOST  dangerous job is like a couple little kids arguing over who has the toughest dad.  And for what it's worth and for anybody that doesn't already know, my son was an iron worker for 20 years and worked the high steel all over the world and was killed when he fell from a building he was putting up.  One of the most dangerous jobs around, but he NEVER talked about the dangers of his job with anybody except  his co-workers & me.  Give it up guys."
556067,Rick2,2011-02-27 20:51:00,15,Being able to stop safely at an amber light is a judgement call the driver has to make.......not the cop.
556068,Mattitude,2011-02-27 20:53:00,155,"I get called names at my job too but I can't give them warnings and then ultimately throw them down and arrest them for doing it, if I did I would be fired.  When most people sign up for a job they know the risks."
556070,Grimace,2011-02-27 20:56:00,2020,Probably is.  How many times a week does a cop get robbed at knife point?  He may have had a point.  I bet if he was caught street racing he wouldn't be put on paid suspension by the good old boys club either.  I am done with this.  The fact of the matter is that cops do not have to adhere to the law like normal citizens. Simple as that.  They are also the ones busting citizens to the letter of the laws that they themselves do not follow.  How can a cop keep a straight face issuing a speeding ticket when minutes earlier and later and on there own time they drive around like idiots. How do they issue a ticket for running a red light with a straight face when they throw the cherries on to get through them to get to Tim Horton's faster. Where they get free coffee for being the finest people on earth.  The rest of us can not talk out of both sides of our mouths or we are taken to task for it.  When there is any discourse about the state of the police the cops do just as they always do.  Puke out the same old propaganda and cover each others behinds.  I love how they scold citizens for not coming forward as witnesses. Then when 20 or so cops witnessed the unlawful beating of a citizen By a another cop there was nothing but crickets.  Sorry but these are the types of things that make cops lose credibility.
555731,cwpowell,2011-02-26 21:30:00,265,"So I was driving down Queenston road in Hamilton thsi morning dropping my girlfriend off at work. All of the sudden the light turns yellow, nd I make no attempt to stop as it was still wet out and I was on the side where there was still a little snow left over. As I'm going through the light I notice a cop in the other side. crap I say to myself, my girlfriend says is he coming after you? Yep I say. So he comes up to my car, license, ownership, insurance. I start digging through my glove box looking for my little wallet with the slips in it. No where to be found. So I say sir I appologize I can't seem to find my ownership and insurance. He goes back to his car, and comes back with a ticket in hand. Charles do you realize a redlight ticket is $450 dollars and 5 points as it went up last January, not having your ownership is 100 dollars, and not having your insurance slip is 65 dollars. I apologize to him telling where I think my information might be and he says no worries. I noticed you like to fish he says ( I had5 5 or 6 ice fishing rods in the back of my car as well as a couple tip ups) He made some small talk about fishing. and said well I've given you the lowest ticket which is not being able to produce your insurance slip and its 65$ dollars. He sends me on my way and says good luck fishing!    I'm taking that as one fisherman to another. He let me off big time!  My girlfriend said thank god you had those rods in the back!"
555737,mercman,2011-02-26 21:52:00,7054,catch and release at its finest
555746,splashhopper,2011-02-26 22:25:00,2931,"Might want to remind your girl of this ever once in a while >>>  ""My girlfriend said thank god you had those rods in the back! ""  "
555748,Leecher,2011-02-26 22:32:00,7832,You can thank your little fishes he let you off that easy Man that's some serious $$$ if he would of gone and give it to you
555749,Canuck2fan,2011-02-26 22:40:00,1444,"Glad you got off so lightly.... Sometimes officers are like that, somtimes they aren't. One time I got pulled over in my 67 Galaxie 500 convertible. The officer talked for about 20 minutes how similar the car was to his son's 67 ford fairlane.... Then he still gave me the ticket for 15KM over the speed limit not reduced mind you I was doing exactly 15KM over the limit.  Maybe some of the officers on here can answer this question I have a friend who was an OPP SGT and he claims there is NO violation under the highway traffic for going through a YELLOW light? Is he right or just trying to get me more tickets by listening to him LOL."
555751,fishing n autograph,2011-02-26 22:44:00,2540,There is.... Its called amber light fail to stop and is 4 pts and a $180 fine
555775,lew,2011-02-26 23:53:00,12766," Personally I think it's totally disgusting that you got any ticket at all for not having your papers with you.  There's not a person alive who hasn't forgotten their papers at one time or another and it sure as heck doesn't make you a criminal and most definetely doesn't deserve a fine.  There was a time not so long ago where if you were stopped and couldn't produce your license the copper simply wrote it up and gave you 24 hours to stop in any police station and produce it, and then the ticket was cancelled.  Simply forget your wallet at home these days and you can be out a couple hundred dollars....that's pretty damned sad if you ask me."
555809,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 00:59:00,2540,"Lew, he was given the fail to have insurance card as a break. He was stopped for failing to stop at the red light which carries a much higher penalty.  It's pretty low to give a tag for failing to have an insurance card if that was why you were pulled over. Usually getting that ticket is a break for something much more higher. Same with fail to surrender drivers licence and fail to surrender permit, both are given instead of a more serious offence (usually points)...that being said, there are a few people out there would triple tap him with all three offences...  I understand what you're saying, but $65 and no effect on your insurance is much better than $325 and 4 points, having to take a day off of work to fight it and possibly spend money on a paralegal...."
555835,lew,2011-02-27 01:39:00,12766,"Dave, the man said he went thru a yellow light, not a red one, but whether he did or not isn't really the point as far as I'm concerned.  Either give him a ticket for running the light, or don't give him a ticket, it doesn't really matter, but the fact he got nailed for no papers is still a crock.  Like I said before, a man isn't a criminal because he forgets his wallet and he sure as heck doesn't deserve a ticket for being forgetful.  I've done it, you've done it and no doubt every copper in town has done it."
555839,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 01:43:00,2540," the real crock would be if he got nailed with failing to sign his ownership in ink!  don't worry lew, i still love ya!"
555845,Canuck2fan,2011-02-27 01:53:00,1444, So now you now you have to stop for amber lights? Come to my hometown after 1AM when all the lights start flashing amber to let traffic flow and you could write tickets till your fingers bleed. LOL
555846,pikehunter,2011-02-27 01:57:00,1659,You got off easy considering what could have happened. Sometimes common interests pay off  Betcha youre glad he wasn't a card carrying P3TA member   I remember those days Lew. It was a much more decent and civil way for the law to handle a miniscle incident. These days you have to make sure you dot yours I's and cross all your T's so to speak.
555847,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 01:58:00,2540," it's not new....  I've layed that charge once...but it was after a collision and both drivers were charged...  I know it's on the books in the HTA, but it's one of the charges that is rarely layed - I could probably come up with a dozen offences that everyone does on a daily basis that they didn't know was illegal..."
555851,Canuck2fan,2011-02-27 02:23:00,1444, That seems about right.....
555853,beginner,2011-02-27 02:25:00,542,i gotta start putting a rods in the backseat just incase.. lol  fisherman helps fisherman...
555878,HTHM,2011-02-27 04:44:00,4082,"Just to play devil's advocate here, not intended to stir the pot, if when you were a firefighter would you have the same attitude if a landlord forgot to change the batteries in the smoke alarm? Once again a simple oversight, but with, granted much higher consequences, if something goes wrong. I was once pulled over for doing 49 over the limit, the limit changed on a country road and I did not notice, and was written up for the exact same offence. I was not upset because I recognized the break the officer was giving me. Another time I was pulled over in my brothers driveway, and was given the same charge, I took it to court because the officer did not give me enough time to find the paperwork in my vehicle. After he has written the ticket I found the paperwork and presented it to him and he told me to pound salt and take it to court. So I did, he did not show up which was a dissapointment to me as I had some pointed questions that I wished to ask him."
555880,HTHM,2011-02-27 04:45:00,4082,The HTA is a wonderful confusing thing isn't it!?
555892,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 10:58:00,2540,"Confusing yes, but I find that there is a general lack of knowledge when it comes to the basic rules of the road. I'm not sure if its a lack of education or no driver training or what but I'm finding more and more people not knowing that you have to stop at a stop sign or red light to turn right or if there is nothing coming.   That being said, I spoke with my staff sgt regarding the ability to produce your documents within 24 hours. He told me that the courts and the powers that sent out a message a long time ago that it had to stop. The HTA and CAIA (compulsary automobile insurance act) says that all documents have to be surrendered forthwith (right away) on demand..not within 24 hours. Why? Don't ask me, I didn't write the laws lol  Now on the flip side, ya it sucks to get a ticket, I've received a few, but laws are laws and there are far too many people picking and choosing which ones to follow. For example....I don't think anyone would feel bad for anyone fishing out of season, or with too many lines or without a licence when all those rules are common knowledge for those that fish. They're rules that all of us fisherpeople follow and have no problems with. Why is the HTA any different? Both fall under the provincial offences act..."
555895,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-27 11:44:00,1622,"not having your ownership is 100 dollars, and not having your insurance slip is 65 dollars. I'm not sure about you but my ownership & insurance slip is always in the glove box, I think he got off easy, just saying SBK"
555896,lew,2011-02-27 11:44:00,12766," I guess this can be spun any way a person wants, but there's a BIG difference between intentionally breaking laws and simply forgetting to put your drivers license & insurance papers in your pocket when you run down to the corner store for a loaf of bread.  Not blaming the coppers at all Dave cause your just following orders, but an expensive ticket for forgetfullness is nothing more than a HUGE $$$$ grab.  Run a red light, gimme a ticket....  Forget my wallet, gimme a break....  Anyways, that's how I feel about it."
555897,fishing n autograph,2011-02-27 11:48:00,2540,All good lew...but everything in this country/province seems to be a money grab nowadays
555898,lew,2011-02-27 11:53:00,12766,"Absolutely Dave.  I'm heading into town shortly, guess I better go look for my license"
555934,buckster,2011-02-27 15:19:00,530,A law is a law as far as i'm concerned.   They are not there to be broken they are there to be followed.  Forgetfullness imo is no excuse.   I have had friends that forgot their fishig license at home and got tickets.  Sure if this happend to me i would like to be sent on my way without a ticket but not everyone is that lucky
555938,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-27 15:34:00,835,"Make sure you throw out the old insurance slip, someone here gave the cop an outdated slip,and then found the new one, the cop refused it and wrote her up for failure to produce her insurance slip.   Now if a couple of cops park in a no parking zone for the purpose of sleeping together and along comes a good Samaritan who spots the car and feels something is not right and possibly foul play. Samaritan investigates and finds two possibly injured or dead police officers but to his relief they were just sleeping. After taking pictures of sleeping cops Samaritan is charged for illegally parking.  As the officers were not working at the time, should they also get a parking ticket?  Now when we were younger when we found a sleeping cop we would put the back wheels by his open window and do a brake stand totally smoke him out. If you try this make sure your pointed in the opposite direction for a fast get away."
