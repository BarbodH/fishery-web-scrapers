555687,mercman,2011-02-26 18:43:00,7054,"Well, there was a ton of people there.Lots of charters and guiding services.The usual Boat brands, and outboard motor brands, but i was disappointed in the representation of some of the major lure and bait companies.Live Target were not even there Rapala was well represented and i picked up a few clackin cranks and clackin jerks.Shimano was there, as well as Abu, and BTW Solo, i spoke to a rep about the trouble you had with your reel.He was truly saddened by your treatment, and assured me that it was not the standard for the company, and yours was not the only complaint.He assured me that new policy has been put into place and that customer service reps were being retrained  I also met Loic and his crew from Fishinstuff. I finally got a chance to examine their rods and new reels closely. Amazing quality products to say the least.The rods are well balanced and sensitive, and the new line of reels are smooth and solid.The reels are spincasters, with a new line of baitcasting coming out next year.Here they are. Loic is the one on the left. Nice Guy too !!   All in all,a nice outting.               Come on soft water !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Paul"

We only had about 5 booths that actually sold fishing stuff.The others were the major manufactuer booths with their new products.I sure wasn't looking at some guys rods  ,this is how I roll....... "
555858,mercman,2011-02-27 02:57:00,7054,"I'm sure i saw you there, i KNOW i saw her I even think i bumped into you at one point.Had a Pentax around my neck, and a WFN hat on."

555922,Roy,2011-02-27 14:40:00,13728,"Monsieur Lafleur, you party animal you! Looks like you had a good time."
555931,mercman,2011-02-27 15:11:00,7054,  You were right Roy .....There was a booth selling bed sheets at the show Still shaking my head about that.
555950,Billy Bob,2011-02-27 15:47:00,5865, I know just enough Spanish and also a lot of sign language to get me in lots of trouble....
556122,mercman,2011-02-27 23:18:00,7054,"Oh, and i bought one of these on saturday too. More for the novelty, but its well made and i am gonna use it this season at least once    sposed to be good for fish up to 5lbs too."
556165,skeeter,2011-02-28 02:15:00,1907,Why does Lebaron's go to that show and not the one here????? I want to file a complaint!!!!!!!!!  those pen rods and reels were on sale at princess auto here awhile back.
556186,mercman,2011-02-28 03:00:00,7054,  We dont have a BPS Skeets. Sail didnt even show their faces to our show. Talk about independant
556262,skeeter,2011-02-28 13:42:00,1907,"BPS wasnt at the show either.  Lebarons use to be at the show every year. I loved it cause i would go to there booth first, grab there catalog, then go to the rest of the booths. It was funny to go to a booth where they had a sign ""Show Special"" then look it up in the catalog and lebarons REGULAR price was cheaper."
556290,FISHINGSTUFFF,2011-02-28 14:28:00,11,Hy guys  thank you very much Mercman.   But sorry the shirts are for staff only ...  we had great feedbacks on our new Fishingstuff ''Fighter'' reel and record crowd this year... to resume : great success for us on this show !  maybe next year in Toronto....  Loïc
556363,mercman,2011-02-28 17:20:00,7054," I was really happy to see that Le barons is cheaper for almost everything i compared with BPS. They had a huge booth at the montreal show.I bought a few lures and paid 3 bucks less each, than i paid for the same thing at BPS."
556368,carll2,2011-02-28 17:33:00,443,"awesome pics!!!! it was a decent show, especially saturday and sunday with lots of people...i was @ laventurier du gouin fishing lodge booth..  did you guys see the girl at the fishing dominican republic booth???? hahaha i wont say anymore, off to gatineau this week for the fishing show!"
