556563,cwpowell,2011-03-01 03:14:00,265,Does anyone have any experience with these rods? Looking to pick one up soon.
556570,ckrb2007,2011-03-01 03:40:00,449,Not sure about the vendettas....but I just picked up a Verdict a few weeks ago and love the feel and balance with my Revo STX on it. Can't wait to catch a bucketmouth on it!
556573,Gregoire,2011-03-01 04:00:00,1397,"I have a 6'6"" two piece medium casting rod. It is really light but I find it a bit stiff. I've only used it a few times. These are nice rods for the money. If I had to do it over again I would have gotten a compre or a rapala r-type."

556581,backbay,2011-03-01 04:24:00,773,"I have a 7' MH, and although I haven't had it out on the water yet, I can echo what's already been said here, in that these things are stiff for their ratings. Hope that helps, happy shopping"
556649,umKthxbye,2011-03-01 14:03:00,247,I have a 6'6 MH 2 piece baitcaster with a shimano caenan reel. The rod is very conferrable in my hands. I got in in December so haven't been able to use it yet. It's light and looks nice. Feels solidly built. Feel stiff enough to be good with pitching and flipping. I wish i had got the 7 footer though but it wasn't available in the 2 piece. It wasnt expensive either.
556778,fishindude,2011-03-01 20:00:00,220,"7'3 MH 1 piece here, I use it as my frog rod and for pitching jigs and plastics. Great rod, very light with a sensitive tip and good backbone for horsing the fish out. I have it paired with a Shimano Citica and the low profile seat matched with the low profile reel makes it real comfortable to palm in my hand.  Cheers"
