555598,flyfisherkirk,2011-02-26 11:52:00,23,Hey all! The Ontario Fishing Regs state in Durham region all streams from the CN bridge to the lake are no closed season. It does not say anything about the Wilmot being closed after the 31st of Dec. I thought it was closed. Can anyone shed a light on this.  Fred
