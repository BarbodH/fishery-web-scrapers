555556,mercman,2011-02-26 01:24:00,7054,4HP Hemi    That mouse startled the heck out of that horse too  
555582,Nipfisher,2011-02-26 04:07:00,2449,That's a mole not a mouse. Seen lots in the snow up north.

556034,Canuck2fan,2011-02-27 19:55:00,1444,Yeah I have seen similar pull outs around here.... One friend of mine refused to be pulled out by horses because he had teased someone about having been saved by horses. So he sat there for 5hrs in the cold waiting for a tow truck LOL.
