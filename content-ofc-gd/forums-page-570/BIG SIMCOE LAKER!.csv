555832,BIG FISH,2011-02-27 01:34:00,54,"got out today to test the dune buggy on the ice started out at gilford and worked our way up the lake catching lots of little perch we finally ended up near a group of huts near fox island. dropped the fish finder in and marked 80 fow, and fish on screen we thought here we go, hopefully catch a whitie or two for dinner. drop the spoons down and bam more perch    we were pissed cause we had been catching perch all day and wanted something bigger. so we sat there for a bout half an hour catching dink perch and finally we said ok lets get out of here so i reel up my line and pack it up, then my dad reels in his line pretty fast, and a mark on the finder comes screaming in after it. his spoon is now about 15 feet below the ice and the fish is charging it from the depths i said to him stop reeling for a sec and let it sit there. BAM! the fish slammed right in to it , my dads little perch rod with 4 lb line bends right over and the drag starts going. after about 5 mins his rod breaks right in half   got the fish we were looking for !!! and the dune buggy ran great !!!!   fish measured 33"" long  18"" girth and was released, he was puking up 6"" smelts when we brought him up    heres a better pic of the dunebuggy if anyone is interested    and a couple from on the ice today    "
