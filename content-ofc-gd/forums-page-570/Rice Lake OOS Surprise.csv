555815,Michael_Brown,2011-02-27 01:09:00,411,While fishing for panfish today on Rice Lake. Chris hooked up to a chunk of a largemouth. Close to a 5lb bucket. Quick photo and back down the hole. Good fight for a sluggish winter fish.

555841,beginner,2011-02-27 01:46:00,542,nice fish
555842,EC1,2011-02-27 01:46:00,930,Nice. It seems that they are more yellow brown in the winter. Possibly to match the colour of the dead weeds?

555979,Michael_Brown,2011-02-27 17:10:00,411,We tried a new spot and it worked out. We caught a bluegill for Ben's Panfish Derby which won second place for Steve Hatton. Chris caught this bucket and I straightened the hook out on something large as well. Those little panfish baits get beat up by big fish in the winter.  A nice little surprise.

556268,Michael_Brown,2011-02-28 13:51:00,411,"  Now that he knows where it lives, you will probably see him holding that fish on a stage this summer.  That's all he needs is another big bass spot on Rice Lake. "
