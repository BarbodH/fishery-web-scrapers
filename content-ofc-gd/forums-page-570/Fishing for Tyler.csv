555953,12footspringbok,2011-02-27 15:53:00,459,Third year in a row i made it out this year didn't fish with dad but dragged a friend along with me. Blasted up to BBP first thing marked a few fish here and there but nothing to serious. Met Terry out there chatted with him for a few minutes he wasn't into much action yet either. Decided to move then move again and repeated the process 4 or 5 more times. One more move a few miles into the middle lake produced the same thing initially one or two fish on the screen then nothing. Ten am and no fish yet.     So we made on last move even farther out. Bingo! Right off the bat steady marked doubles and triples moving through.  Jimmy was the first to hook up.   A nice lil whitey.   He dropped several more fish and i was getting discouraged but then I went on a tear.   Nice whitey   and another    After missing and dropping several fish and watching me get 6 through the hole and losing a couple more half way up and at the hole Jimmy was itching for a second fish and he got one more.    Quarter to 11 things started to slow down i told Jimmy it was make or break time with a half hour ride back to the park.  One more hookup for me and it felt like something a bit more decent. Ended up being a plump little laker 25.5 inches    Packed up for the long tour back in. Not really that long of a ride 11 miles to be exact but long when you've got two on a one up antique machine plus an auger LOL. Made it back in with time to spare. We both made off with a nice prize and were happy  We still had the itch though so headed out to try for some perch. Only ended up catching dinks though.      Thanks to Tyler and everyone that makes this thing happen.
