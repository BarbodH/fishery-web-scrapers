555649,Bunker,2011-02-26 16:31:00,29,Hi: all  I got this 3phase motor that is on my table saw I have not been able to use  the table saw  scince I bought it from this industrial sale but it dose run it ran before they sold it. so I know the motor is good. My Question is can it be made to run from my 220v outlet.  If it can how? or what is the best way to go about this..  Thanks Dave

555655,Bunker,2011-02-26 16:50:00,29,"Sorry I forgot to add the volt its 575v,   I was hoping to avoid a converter. but if that's the only way I gues I got not choice..   Dave"
555658,Gerritt,2011-02-26 16:58:00,6129,"very few homes have 3 phase power... looks like you have to get a converter (if available), a transformer or replace the motor with a 220v single phase.   decent resource here http://www.finewoodworking.com/pages/w00126.asp"
555669,Bunker,2011-02-26 17:34:00,29,I guess I could always buy a 3 hp 220v 1 phase motor and mount that as another option...  Dave

555764,Fishnwire,2011-02-26 23:21:00,983,  That's the best way to go but the only problem you might have is getting the single phase motor to fit where the three-phase motor was if the space it tight.  Three phase motors are only about 2/3 to 3/4 the physical size of an equivalent output single phase motor.
