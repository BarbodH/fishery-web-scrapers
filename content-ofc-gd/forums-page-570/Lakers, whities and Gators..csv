Saturday we went for whitefish.  unlike simco, in Qc they are hard to locat and catch in numbers.  We start the day with a nice laker. O.O.S and released A.S.A.P.  quick pic tho!    Then we headed off to a 15 FOW flat.  Coregone ON!    Caught more sun than fish but it was a nice family outting none-the-less  sunday.   Gator Hunt.   10 Am Prime time.  drop 4 rods and the second and fourth drop one after the next.    made for a sweet double header.  My turn comes.        Finding these in 15 to 30 FOW was key.    nothing like C&R BABY!     This has beed another 24/7 update from QC   IM OUT!"
