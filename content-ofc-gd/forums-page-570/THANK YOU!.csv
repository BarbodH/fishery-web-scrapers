556355,limeyangler,2011-02-28 17:01:00,5204,"Hi all,  Ok...i've seen this done before on here and voted for a few too. So i was wondering if this community could help our community build a no kill animal shelter here in Dryden.  We are in 1st place at present and voting ends tonight at midnight.  In the last two attempts this year we came 2nd narrowly missing out out the substantial funds on offer.  Second chance pet stores owned by a good neighbour of ours does so much for animal welfare in Dryden and surrounding areas and presently rent a property next to the pet store which is the No-Kill shelter. They have re-housed over 300 animals in the last 2 years but have outgrown the space.  click on the link and vote if you can...would be much appreciated.  HELP BUILD A NO-Kill Shelter"
