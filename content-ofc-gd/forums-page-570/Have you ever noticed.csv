556513,mercman,2011-03-01 00:53:00,7054,"   Then my efforts have not been in vain!!! and I bet you anything, you are gonna try it on your dog if you have one, or on someone elses. It doesnt work on cats though. It just gets them pissed"
556514,mercman,2011-03-01 00:56:00,7054,  Cripes NO..i should have mention that !!! Same reaction as cats. Dang....sorry man

556523,dhickey,2011-03-01 01:41:00,1038,you realy shouldnt do that.  infections suck for the dog and your wallet .and yes they have a instinctive desire to keep themselves clean as well as other companions of theirs.   has your dog ever licked a cut or infection on you hand?    (ya im a dog guy)  ps. dogs will use their paws to scratch thier ears and lick thier paws (ticks or infection)   i could go on but it would bour every body.
556538,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-01 02:05:00,0,i think you might have something here merc.  perhaps you should alert the media!

556561,solopaddler,2011-03-01 03:09:00,8605,"The expression ""digging your own grave"" pops to mind."
556564,mercman,2011-03-01 03:15:00,7054,"   Ya gotta admit though, its britened up the place a bit.And its not caused any ear infections either. And now....back to your regularly scheduled programing. I will let this fade into the archives.Thanks to all for tolerating this silly little thread"

556619,mercman,2011-03-01 12:47:00,7054,I Know !!!! I've been noticing some more strange an intrigueing canine behaviour. I just have to corellate my findings before presentation
556620,mercman,2011-03-01 12:48:00,7054,  Wait for it..............................
556634,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 13:24:00,1107,LOL I love how some guys actually think the dudes serious Merc's obviously a smart   and just trying to joke around .Fuuny post Merc a little weird even for OFC but funny none the less.BTW you need to go
556639,Grimace,2011-03-01 13:35:00,2020,"I am pretty sure he was waiting for someone to say. ""Hey it works!!"".  Then the joke would be on them, but no one bit.  It is either that or, well, I don't know. Lol."
556654,skeeter,2011-03-01 14:18:00,1907,  
556687,solopaddler,2011-03-01 15:49:00,8605, Hmmmm...I wouldn't be so sure. Anyone want to place a wager that he was serious?
556690,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-01 15:55:00,1107,I try to give the benifit of doubt even when its a guy from Quebec LOL
556691,Spiel,2011-03-01 15:55:00,9065,No doubt in my mind he was serious. Also dumbest post I've ever seen and hopefully will ever see!
556236,mercman,2011-02-28 12:49:00,7054,"Sitting here the other day, drinking a coffee, and petting my Lab. I scratched her ear,inside, and when i took out my finger she sniffed and licked it. Did it again.....same thing. I then tried it on my Pom....Same thing. Next i went next door and tried it on my neighbors bichon maltais....same thing My neighbors looks at me weird now. Oh well....  Whats up with that !!! Could it be, that because they have no fingers, this is the only way they can know whats going on in there Its just about the only part of their body they cant reach....  Any Ideas why  I know some of you will try this,at least i hope so. Try it, they always do the same thing...every time too."
556239,Rod Caster,2011-02-28 12:55:00,5784,"odd topic.  At least you didn't call it ""where I stick my fingers""  "
556240,skeeter,2011-02-28 12:55:00,1907,"I knew there was something strange about you, and you just put your finger on it."
