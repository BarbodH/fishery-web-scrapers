556366,Terry,2011-02-28 17:29:00,14456,as long as it doesn't scare them off......
556481,camillj,2011-02-28 23:53:00,1988,Yep .. always thought it attracted em ... caught lots of fish just as people not too far away were drillin new holes.
554111,Terry,2011-02-21 21:14:00,14456,"the video speaks for itself      and whitefish swimming around   feel free to comment on the video on youtube if you like it   oh one other thing..has this ever happened to you  have you ever drilled some extra holes just over from you hut just in case you want to fish outside your hut  then you fish in the dark hut later you need to take a pee so you go out in the bright sun light squinting your eyes form the sun reflecting off the snow, barely able to see anything  you start to relieve yourself as your eyesight starts to come back only to see a man and woman fishing in your holes 4 ft away from where you are pe....ahhh....never mind...."
554115,mercman,2011-02-21 21:19:00,7054,I bet they will make a bit more noise the next time they fish beside a hut.They musta been pissed off !!!
554116,Joey,2011-02-21 21:20:00,9122,"Well that video tells the tale.  But I already thought the sound attracted more than repelled them.  They look pretty calm to me, as I noted on your Youtube site  Sorry we didn't join ya today, slept in.  Oh well, Tyler next weekend then off for a week of fishing after that.  Can't wait Terry"
554124,irishfield,2011-02-21 21:26:00,26272,As long as she said >WOW< Terry.. you're golden !
554126,Terry,2011-02-21 21:27:00,14456,or I will let my eyes adjust before wander out..   it was cold and nasty windy there was snow from last night on the ice on the way there but the high wind blew it all away for the trip back to IBP..  see you next weekend
554127,ChrisK,2011-02-21 21:28:00,2772,The way I saw it is the fish spooked when he fired up the auger and then as the auger noise subsided the fish returned ???? So this tells me the gas auger spooked the fish ???
554128,Terry,2011-02-21 21:28:00,14456, someone was golden..LOL
554132,Terry,2011-02-21 21:34:00,14456," I guess I should have shown the full 5 mins before I started the auger, there were no fish, then 4 or 5 fish went swimming by while I cut the hole and more the second I shut it off I am pretty sure they weren't off camera sitting still waiting for the noise to stop I believe they were just swimming along undisturbed by the noise and continued pass  and many people say,""well there goes the fishing for the nest half hour because someone has started up a gas auger...clearly fish were not scared out of the area for any length of time"
554133,splashhopper,2011-02-21 21:36:00,2931,"Terry:  The jury is out on whether they were attracted to the auger... or scared away...  But on another note for your ice hut..  If you put a mirror on the outside that says:  ""Objects in mirror are smaller than they appear"" maybe the hole stealers will get the message"
554135,splashhopper,2011-02-21 21:37:00,2931,"soooo,.... did u catch any fish right after u took that footage ?"
554137,irishfield,2011-02-21 21:39:00,26272,Happened last year as well.. Terry and I were set up fishing and Terry was in his closed hut and I had mine open and fishing about 30 feet way.. I yelled over to Terry that he had company as some guys where chipping away to open an old hole less than 3 feet in front of Terry's door !
554141,Leecher,2011-02-21 21:45:00,7832,"Before looking at the video, I would of said that the noise of drilling with a gas auger attracts fish.... I've seen it many a times where I would drop the bait down in a newly drilled hole and right away get a fish to hit   sometimes it would be the one a few feet away  After viewing it.... well I still say it attracts them no question ask  Cool video Terry and thanks for sharing Leechman"
554145,Terry,2011-02-21 21:53:00,14456," well....that is a good question  after I drilled the hole I pulled the camera up put it down the other hole went inside the hut and seen I had left the camera running/recording, reset it found my lure on the camera and recorded a hit on my lure but missed the fish  but that took 7 or 8 minutes after I drilled the hole but within a few seconds of me jigging my lure after setting back up....had I know I recorded the auger drilling and noise I would have stated jigging right away to see what happens"
554147,irishfield,2011-02-21 21:55:00,26272,It definitely attacts them.. whether it's the noise or the sudden light. Don't know how many times I've drilled holes and that Keith guy has shoved a spoon thru the slush and pulled up a fish. Don't take the time to scoop fellas!
554148,Terry,2011-02-21 21:56:00,14456," I remember that day..I was sitting sitting in my hut thinking MAN does noise ever travel far here, it almost sounds like they are right outside my door..who'da thunk it..they were,,,LOL"
554150,fishnsled,2011-02-21 21:59:00,3520,"I've always believed it didn't matter. Even in shallow water I've found if things get slow, pop a couple more holes and the fish seem to move back in. They maybe spooked initially when fishing shallow but by the time you get set up they are back to see what the noise is all about. Great video Terry."
554151,Governator,2011-02-21 22:00:00,879,"Cool video, thanks!  Do you think it could be different in 15-20' of water with perch below?"
554153,Terry,2011-02-21 22:06:00,14456,you bet. could be different results........I will find an open hole and do the same in shallow water and see what perch do when I fish perch again  but I have had many tell me it scares them in 60/80ft too and that is why they always use a manual auger and wished everyone else would be considerate and do the same
554156,fishnsled,2011-02-21 22:13:00,3520, I'm looking forward to seeing the results of the shallow water results. I've over heard (sound travels well out on the lake) guys complain about me and my power auger. They got very quite when I iced my whitie a couple of jigs later...
554208,fishhunter,2011-02-22 00:45:00,604,Was good to see you out today. we fished till 2 and then packed it in. fishing never really shut off for long. we finished 7 for 15. hardest thing was leaving with lots of fish still coming up on the screen. Oh well I hope they will be waiting sat for me. It was nice to be on the same holes that I was on yesterday for me. It was funny to see so little people out today. Thats a kool video Terry. only thing that scares fish away if when they know Terry is hunting them   lol
554211,Terry,2011-02-22 00:51:00,14456,you might be right  that's why I have been wearing a wig and dark sunglasses.....just don't tell them it's me and I will keep catching them...LOL
554212,Rizzo,2011-02-22 00:53:00,4754, ...tell them to come over and drill some holes for you then!
554214,fishhunter,2011-02-22 00:55:00,604,lmao
554215,Fisherman,2011-02-22 00:55:00,7201,"Yer auger sounds like it has a bad case of chicken farts, tweak the high speed a bit."
554439,ah_long,2011-02-23 00:35:00,354,"I think while it 'attracts' the fish, it doesn't necessarily mean that the fish would bite, it could just mean the fish are on high alert"
