555495,Terry,2011-02-25 22:52:00,14456,it doesn't seem to hurt it  but I have seen it too frozen together to use
555506,skeeter,2011-02-25 23:50:00,1907,"Make Damn sure that the container doesnt leak , which it WILL. It will stink up every thing that is near it. You would be smart to put it into another container right now, if its in the crappy one with the green lid."
555530,Eazy,2011-02-26 00:36:00,260,"Yah, I just got the ones in the resealable pouch, not the GULP ALIVE!"
555572,Terry,2011-02-26 02:39:00,14456,when they dry out the go rubbery then hard
555589,chefboi17,2011-02-26 08:04:00,128,"Double bag the pouch, I had a bag of gulp leak in my vest last spring, that's some stinky stuff when it marinates into your clothes"
555722,mike rousseau,2011-02-26 21:06:00,4661,I heard that the juice is devastating on boat carpit...  I always  keep it in my splashwell ... I also rig it on there too...  I've had some freeze... No bigy ../ just thaw it out and your good to go!
555728,manitoubass2,2011-02-26 21:19:00,11391,"It's not great to use them frozen. I'm not sure about the scent, but it impairs the action on the bait"
