556471,douG,2011-02-28 23:30:00,2693,"If you need a handheld GPS, you won't go wrong with this one.  It has an expandable memory, a very sensitive receiver (MIL grade), and the ability to load whatever map you want - topo, marine or city.  On the other hand, the screen is small, and it doesn't float.  But other than that, this is a steal.  I paid triple this price for my 76 series, same engine."
556480,Rod Caster,2011-02-28 23:53:00,5784,any other opinions on this? Good availability/price of maps?  Good price for this model. Thanks for posting.
556697,johnnyb,2011-03-01 16:09:00,3413,Great little unit....not a horrible deal at all.  I've got the 76csx and it's fantastic.  
556707,atvaholic,2011-03-01 16:38:00,271,I Have the GPS 60 (the same unit but no upgradeable memory).  I have it loaded with the topo maps of areas that I frequent. I love it and wont leave home without it.
