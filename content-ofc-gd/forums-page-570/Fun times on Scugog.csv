556294,GBW,2011-02-28 14:38:00,8460,"Yesterday we had a 10 person or so G2G onthebog and good times and good food was had by all. derby went from 3PM to 7PM and it was $10 per person for the biggest walleye of the day and another $10 for the biggest crappie. first fish of the day goes to Hud and it was in the mid 30's.   a few small fish were caught after that.  then it's my turn around 5:30PM.  16.5"" on a tear-drop jig tipped with a minnow.  that's young_one behind me.   as 7:00PM nears closer everyone is jigging like crazy to get a walleye bigger then mine, no such luck though.  at the end, there is a new ""walter-weight champ"", me...   it was a great time, and the on ice fish fry followed by some crazy good wings was the iceing on the cake.  Thanks for the fun times to all that were there!  Geoff"
