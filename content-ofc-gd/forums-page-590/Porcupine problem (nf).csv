539064,Rod Caster,2011-01-13 23:41:00,5784,"I'd say trap him or scare him out of the area. I'm sure a few brush fires (controlled fire) near his den would send him on his way.  ..or odors, or noises.  Try a battery powered radio set on the CBC....worked for raccoons at my old work.  When they walk, you can really tell they are part of the bear family..neat little animals, but a nuissance sometimes.  "
539099,Gerritt,2011-01-14 01:04:00,6129, Bear family? please tell me you are joking? Porcupines are rodents.  G
539103,walleyejigger,2011-01-14 01:11:00,876,"porcupines are actually quite nocturnal, though daytime sittings obviously occur, just easier to see them in the day is all"
539151,Sinker,2011-01-14 02:47:00,8692,"I see them all the time in the day, during the winter. I think they get up in the trees around 11am, and hang out until around 3pm, when the sun is at its highest. Once it starts getting cooler, they get down. Keep the .22 loaded and ready, you never know when he'll poke his head out!  S."
539153,Rod Caster,2011-01-14 02:54:00,5784,  Yes I am joking  ...hmmm I don't know why I thought that.... it's obvious with a little thought. Win some lose some.
539155,fishcrisp,2011-01-14 02:55:00,17,Try pine and spruce bark with salt on it...
539161,canadadude,2011-01-14 03:03:00,769,"Be carefull wondering through the bush with loaded crossbow or gun at night, thats illegal. You can hunt Porcupines but it must be done during lawfull hours, they are for the most part nocturnal but do venture high up in trees to spend the day. There most active at night and usually den up during the day, trapping the critter would probably be your best bet to get rid of it."
539267,GBW,2011-01-14 13:58:00,8460,got a paintball gun?  a few shots to the backside would make it think twice to coming back to the area.  I chased away a racoon or 4 that way then switched to the fly-bait trick.
539271,Twocoda,2011-01-14 14:09:00,4130, i doubt that would work GBW...they are very Hardy and durable animals...if you dont hit then in the head with a .22 they still walk away ...might want to look into see if there is a bounty on the snout...ive seen them fall 40 feet from a tree hitting branches all the way down and still walk away...
539277,GBW,2011-01-14 14:20:00,8460,it worked on the racoons to make them run away.  the paintball gun can't kill them but the sting makes them think what the hell is hitting me.
539298,irishfield,2011-01-14 15:11:00,26272, ..with a bullet in them !
539300,DanD,2011-01-14 15:12:00,2223,"You could try making up a smudge pot and smoke him out of the den. Worked on the skunks I had living under my front cement stoop. Get a small steel pail, cut up a sponge into small chunks and put into the pail; then soak the sponge in motor oil and set a match to it. Itll barely flame but itll smolder for hours; putting out some eye stinging smoke.  If by chance you do live trap this guy and plan on relocating it; be careful where. Legally youre not supposed to relocate a trapped animal any farther then one kilometer from where it was captured. Dont know what the fine is; but only moving him 1klm away and it wont be long before hes back. I know what I would likely do with it; but even a shallow grave would be hard to dig this time of year. You could call a licensed trapper to deal with the animal after youve trapped it $$. They have the legal right to euthanize it, if they feel that relocating it would cause harm to the animal. Thats what I did, one other time with a ground hog I trapped for my neighbor here in town. It was either that or measure out 1klm; knock on that persons door and ask if they wanted it released in their front or back yard. LOL  Dan."
538673,krawler,2011-01-13 02:32:00,167,"We have a porcupine living on our property, its eating all the bark on our pine and spruce trees, these trees will die in the spring.  we planted them 20+ years ago, sad to see them go.  I know where he lives, huge pile of rocks that has too many ways of getting in and out.  he only comes out at night but have not seen him yet.  i have a Have-a-Heart trap and ive tried every type of fruit to entice him in but no luck.  each week i go up more trees are damagaed.  Any suggestions to get rid of him or deter him from climbing/eating the bark.  we have over 500 trees, cant put up barriers on each tree.  we cant plug the holes in the rocks.  Anyone have a solution??  I posted a message about beavers last year, best solution was to scare the crap out of it, and spray obnoxious odours everywhere.  thanks"
538679,HTHM,2011-01-13 02:39:00,4082,Use a 22
538684,irishfield,2011-01-13 02:49:00,26272,Just look him in those pretty little monkey like eyes.. and pop him in the head with Lead!  The trees won't die.. they'll rebark and come back. I've been dealing with these tree eating buggers for two decades.
538686,Burtess,2011-01-13 02:58:00,901,"Throw a chunk of salt in the trap, they love to lick salt.  Burt"
538695,Skud,2011-01-13 03:09:00,739,They love carrots too
538698,GBW,2011-01-13 03:18:00,8460,fly-bait (it is a fishing forum) and a pepsi like I told you before...
538700,Gerritt,2011-01-13 03:18:00,6129,Apple chunks dipped in salt... Lots of salt... Make a trail leading to the trap.. Place more inside of the trap..
538705,Bernie,2011-01-13 03:38:00,3190,I agree with Gerritts suggestion. Salt is something they crave. I seen a couple of outhouses that were completely destroyed by them.
538708,chilli,2011-01-13 03:52:00,199,"Save the quills if you get him. They're becoming a fashion statement as a hair pin thingy for women  Just make sure you trade em because selling parts of wildlife is illegal  3 things most wildlife crave because it is not readily available in nature. Sweet, fat and salt. I heard the porkies are good eating. Any truth to that?"

538711,irishfield,2011-01-13 03:56:00,26272,You'd probably have to ask a Fisher    Chilli.. or someone from 'bama...

538830,aplumma,2011-01-13 15:23:00,6896,Till you catch him wrap chicken wire around the base of the tree and roll the top over and out from the trees.   Art
538832,ctranter,2011-01-13 15:31:00,543, Crossbows work too
538882,chilli,2011-01-13 17:25:00,199,Funny thing I was thinking about this post today while hanging duck boxes in a Carolinian forest and I spotted some trees that something was eating the bark off of. Then I spotted on tree that had been chewed right to the tips of the branches. There's no way this was a porcupine but there was so much damage what could it be?  That's when I found these guys sleeping nearby  Seems it would have to be pretty dam small to reach the tips of the branches yet a few whole trees had been stripped also.
538883,mercman,2011-01-13 17:29:00,7054,cute little sucker aint he. To bad ya have to blast him !!!
538884,skeeter,2011-01-13 17:33:00,1907,watch out while trying to catch him. those guys tend to be real pricks.

539055,irishfield,2011-01-13 23:22:00,26272,They're generally out during the day Kris.. they just sit quietly on a tree branch and eat !! They are definitely not nocturnal.
