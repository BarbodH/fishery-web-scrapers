The selection isn't the best, but they still have the crayfish cranks and traps, the pumpkinseed, and some smelts.  Take a look:  http://redrockstore.com/Catalog/index.php?crn=251  Can't go wrong for a lure that usually costs 12 or 13 bucks plus tax up here."

538952,PainInTheBass,2011-01-13 19:53:00,102,"I am curious about their lipless crankbaits as well.  I have never had much success with liplless crankbaits, so I have been hesitant to buy these ones at their regular price.  And I think my wife is on high alert with respect to my fishing purchases... so even at this price, it would be iffy..."
