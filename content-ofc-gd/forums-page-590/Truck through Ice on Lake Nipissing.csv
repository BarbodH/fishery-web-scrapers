538808,addy79,2011-01-13 14:54:00,573,wouldn't something like this have SERIOUS impact on the lake from an environmental POV??? I read once that a quart of oil in the water can produce oil slicks over a square kilometer area..  the owners should be on the hook for some fort of environmental cleanup or something along those lines...
538814,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-13 15:03:00,390," Years ago some of the 2 strokes that burned a 40:1 ratio used to leave a trail of oil when you left the dock.  Some still do it to this day.  Yes the fluids in the truck are toxic (battery acid, coolant, hydraulic fluid (tranny and power steering), brake fluid, oil, etc.) but with the lake the size of Nipissing the impact would be minimal.  Consider the fact that where the truck went through is where the sewage treatment outflow is.  Who knows what comes out of there during periods of heavy rains or thaw."
538816,Landlocked,2011-01-13 15:04:00,171,"If he has comprehensive coverage the insurance will respond, if not he is outta luck.  Where you have to be careful is with snowmobile/ATV coverage, some companies add an ""amphibious use excluded"" endorsement.  (but as we say in the industry, there is no exclusion for stupidity)"
538820,irishfield,2011-01-13 15:09:00,26272,"  Thanks for the confimation, from the insurance desk, Andy. What I've always thought and stated.. but every year we get a large lot that say you're out of luck on the ice, which isn't the case... unless you have an old beater with PLPD only on it. (or you're silly enough not to have comprehensive on a new(er) vehicle!!)"
538829,Pikeslayer,2011-01-13 15:22:00,1443,"Irish is absolutely correct  I checked with Mrs. Pikeslayer (Desjardin Insurance) and she confirmed that if his policy was current/valid with the appropriate coverage then this guy's claim will be accepted and processed. So I mention ""great news, now I'll be able to drive out to Skeeters hut"". Mrs. Pikeslayer tells me that there is no such insurance that will cover the beating she will lay on me if I even think about it"
538849,Nipfisher,2011-01-13 16:05:00,2449," I drive my 2004 Explorer Sporttrac on the ice when I determine it is safe enough for me. I absolutely have comprehensive on my truck for the sole reason that I drive it on the ice. Costs me a few extra bucks but well worth it if I ever make a mistake with my judgement. I have friends driving brand new trucks out on the ice when they determine it is safe for them. If it is your every day driver and you use it for ice-fishing then it is worth it.  F.Y.I. I talked with Band staff at Bear Island today in Temagami and they opend the ice road yesterday morning with 8"" of ice. I'll plan my trip for later in the month."
538863,LucG,2011-01-13 16:28:00,779,"I was out there earlier in the day and though to myself: ""I'm surprised no one has gone through yet!""  I ended up leaving shortly before 4, seems as if I just missed the action."
538871,cityfisher,2011-01-13 16:47:00,959,"I asked my broker last year, "" Just incase"" , she said i was covered.  I bought a sled and wont test it"
538872,skeeter,2011-01-13 16:48:00,1907," I am so glad i just finished my coffee before i read that, other wise i would have to see if my insurance would cover the computer from a drowning in coffee!!!!    tell the wife you will get chauffeured out and back in.  "
538885,mercman,2011-01-13 17:35:00,7054,"skeets !!!! ur alive !!!! when i saw the truck, i was worried it was you. I thought the chili must have disagreed with you, and caused an anal infarction"
539169,skeeter,2011-01-14 03:15:00,1907,its been 5 days now so im good to go. just a little burning sensation left.
538553,Arty,2011-01-12 22:42:00,12,Be careful out there. I walk out near this spot. Might be time to find a new one. Ha ha  I saw the towing crew out there today.   Here is the article in the North Bay Nugget.   http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2926575
538554,irishfield,2011-01-12 22:44:00,26272,Same spot.. different year.. they never learn.
538556,Bernie,2011-01-12 22:48:00,3190,Right near the septic plant. Idiots. There are places on any lake to avoid. You can't just go anywhere you please without knowing what you are doing when driving on frozen lakes.
538557,Rod Caster,2011-01-12 22:52:00,5784,Bartlett's got his first recovery job of the year.    
538558,irishfield,2011-01-12 22:52:00,26272,"..at least it's an easy one.. trailer hitch and ass above the ice!  ""600 man hours"".. a couple jack boards and a winch..."
538562,Nemo,2011-01-12 23:03:00,727,600 man hours.... What was that worth?  Wow!!!
538563,mercman,2011-01-12 23:04:00,7054,
538571,TJQ,2011-01-12 23:24:00,7806,Geezz... ya know ya think that maybe the City would put a warning sign out there.. its their discharge that causes the problem.. not everyone automatically knows where that spot is. 
538588,bubbles,2011-01-12 23:55:00,591," Great point, I am heading up in a few weeks and have no idea where you are talking about."
538591,Bernie,2011-01-13 00:03:00,3190,As soon as they put up a sign it could make them liable.
538592,TJQ,2011-01-13 00:05:00,7806,"Well, since its thier discharge thats changing the natural environment, perhaps they should be liable... no different than hydro not posting signs by dams."
538594,Bernie,2011-01-13 00:10:00,3190,"Perhaps TJ. I'm just a wrench wielder, not a lawyer  What about folks that install bubblers around their boathouses in the Muskokas? Are they Liable?"
538650,rob v,2011-01-13 02:04:00,535,in my opinion - you drive a vehicle out there at your own risk/peril.  That's a given - it's a lake - frozen or not frozen - no place for a vehicle esp if you don't know what you're doing.
538655,Bernie,2011-01-13 02:10:00,3190,Any volunteers?  http://northbay.kijiji.ca/c-community-volunteers-TRUCK-STUCK-IN-ICE-ON-LAKE-NIPISSING-VOLUNTEERS-NEEDED-TO-HELP-W0QQAdIdZ253432954
538657,GBW,2011-01-13 02:13:00,8460,"HAHAHAHAHAHA.  Sorry, but the person knew where they went in and should have known better about the ice there."
538658,irishfield,2011-01-13 02:13:00,26272,LOL.. two dead stops thru the ice about 10 feet apart..  two chain falls and a few 16'- 2 x 12 planks and that sucker should come back out..
538671,Arty,2011-01-13 02:31:00,12,Ha ha. I can't believe the Kijiji ad. Priceless. Beware of any Blazer for sale ad on Kijiji for awhile.
538680,walleyejack,2011-01-13 02:43:00,358,How much do they pay volunteers these dayd
538689,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-13 03:01:00,4399,"  I would guess this doorknob`s insurance company is saying no habla senoir you   assuming he has insurance,if he has coverage why would he be begging for help. By the looks of the truck it`s probably not worth the deductible!!!"
538692,irishfield,2011-01-13 03:03:00,26272,"Son in a panic... insurance will cover it.. no different than driving in a mall parking lot that isn't ""assumed by the municpality or crown"" as a legal road."
538797,Headhunter,2011-01-13 14:27:00,5703,They better get it out of there... it could really mess up the nets! HH
538802,Billy Bob,2011-01-13 14:42:00,5865," Interesting......didn't know how the insurance industry would handle this...but I'm guessing his rates will spike.  Now, wouldn't GM be liable because there was no sticker on the dash warning about driving the Blazer on thin ice..."
538803,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-13 14:45:00,390, They probably put the signs out but the recovery companies keep taking them down.  I'm just saying.
538806,canadadude,2011-01-13 14:50:00,769,"They may be liable if they don't, no investigation is going to happen with this accident but if a death occurs in this spot , an investigation could show the city is completly liable. With the amount of traffic using the lake during ice season a warning or sign of this area could prevent a worse tragedy in the future"
538807,daryl0815,2011-01-13 14:52:00,225,"  as far as I know, if you drive onto the lake with anthing other than a boat, be it a car, an ATV or even a snowmobile, your insurance stops at the shoreline, I could be wrong though"
