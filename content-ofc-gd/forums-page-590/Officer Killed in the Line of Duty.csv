I have a friend who was on the gun squad, here in T.O. and if memory serves me well, this Officer was a friend of his. I did not recognize the name, it was a number of years ago, but when I saw his picture on the news, I knew right away that this Officer was one of my friends, friend, who I golfed with. My sympathies go out to his family and all the members of Law enforcement... HH"

And, like usual when I take these trips, I prayed that it wouldn't be the last time I would see my family. I heard this senseless tragedy unfold over the radio during my drive, and last night when I returned home safely it hit me pretty hard. The thought that there's a little boy who's dad wasn't going to be coming home anymore is so terribly saddening. Condolences, thoughts and prayers to the family, and to those who choose to protect and serve."
