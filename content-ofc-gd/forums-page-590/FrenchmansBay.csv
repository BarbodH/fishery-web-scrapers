537516,fishermccann,2011-01-10 19:48:00,655,"I was out on Frenchmans Bay in Pickering on the weekend.( Jan. 8-9.)  The ice is 8 to 10 inches over most of the bay,(except the usual hot spots). With the snow it was a lot easier to walk out compaired to the glare ice we had last week. 12 to 15 fisherpeople on the ice each day, with lots of perch and small pike caught. Minnows 2 feet of bottom in 8 feet of water is what was working, Good Luck!!!"
538183,fishermccann,2011-01-11 23:52:00,655,"Was out again today, what a nice day to be on the ice. some more perch and a couple pike caught.  Not many people  out there ,lots of room to roam!"
538190,bassman87,2011-01-12 00:15:00,586,thanks for the info
538195,GBW,2011-01-12 00:33:00,8460,was that you out there between 4:30 and 5PM?
538261,highdrifter,2011-01-12 02:11:00,2534, Was there too.  Was that you I spoke to?!
538262,highdrifter,2011-01-12 02:12:00,2534, did he have a nautilus floater jacket on??
538264,GBW,2011-01-12 02:15:00,8460,"hard to tell from the GO train     all I was thinking of was the ice close to the tracks is wet, how safe is it out there?"
538270,highdrifter,2011-01-12 02:32:00,2534, Ice was plenty safe where we were.  I'd say about 10in.  Entrance to the bay has some open water though.  Not much doing for us unfortunately.  Had one take in 4 hours of hucking it!!
538273,GBW,2011-01-12 02:35:00,8460,"my only day's I can fish are Sunday's so I go where I know the fish are, and it aint there..."
538279,highdrifter,2011-01-12 02:43:00,2534,Had to see for myself..
538280,daryl0815,2011-01-12 02:47:00,225,"I was there a few times last winter with nothing to show for it, I saw a couple people pull some small pike out about 50 feet from me, but that was the extent of the action, I may try it out soon though, it is pretty close to home."
538306,toca,2011-01-12 04:10:00,274,ice fishing close to home is awesome. too bad i cant do that on grenadier pond
