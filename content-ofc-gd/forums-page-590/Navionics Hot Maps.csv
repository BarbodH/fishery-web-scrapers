537507,addy79,2011-01-10 19:25:00,573,nice!  thanks Roy...
537662,HTHM,2011-01-10 23:48:00,4082,WHERE?!!!!!!
537700,Old Man,2011-01-11 00:50:00,822,Looks like a good price. Cheapest I've seen is $184.
537704,skeeter,2011-01-11 00:58:00,1907,it is a good price & a good map. i have one in my H2Oc.  Roy i believe you missed 1 lake!
537711,Roy,2011-01-11 01:10:00,13728," It's ok Dann, I have it covered...I got Gull, Indian, Black Sturgeon and Perch Lakes twice each in case I missed one of the others."
537714,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-11 01:16:00,4399,"  Yes my home lake, Dalrymple!"
537872,blue pickeral,2011-01-11 11:07:00,267,I looked up this list on the web site hoping to find a few rivers...specifically the Ottawa River. Don't see any on the list. Is this because the Ottawa is made up of a few lakes?  (Noticed this on navigation maps but don't know the lake names well enough.)
537878,devy,2011-01-11 11:41:00,13,I just purchased this chip in the fall but I do recall that is shows contours on the Ottawa River around Ottawa/Kettle Island- downtown Ottawa/Gatineau. Unfortunately My power cord for my Lowrance is in my boat ( put away) so I cant check for you for other parts of the Ottawa. ( I fish the Lakes in Eastern Ontario- even though I live in the  National Capital Region.)  
537986,blue pickeral,2011-01-11 16:24:00,267,"Thanks for giving it a thought...I have the navigational maps from Mattawa past Petawawa/Pembroke to Arnprior but not at hand. It would seem strange that this body of water would not be on the map chip as information is so readily available, yet I don't see anything on the list."
538256,HTHM,2011-01-12 02:03:00,4082,once again with feeling this time WHERE IS THIS BEING SOLD??????????
538416,addy79,2011-01-12 15:43:00,573,sorry bout that...  its being sold on amazon.com; had the chip shipped to my hotel in D.C. for free!
538477,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-12 18:54:00,655,"I think the Ottawa River is on my Great Lakes card if memory serves me correctly. I have a Hotmaps Premium Canada from a few years ago, and it is awesome to have. Navionics has added thousands of lakes since my card, and add more every year, so I'll upgrade maybe next year.  * One word of caution: Hotmaps Premium Canada is not as accurate as the Great Lakes card.  You need to be careful on new waters on the Hotmaps, as it can offer a false sense of security for boating hazards.  I have some shallow shoals marked on my gps now that were not on the card. I got lucky before I realized this.  I believe that I read somewhere that if you map out something like a shoal that isn't on the card, you can send Navionics the info to update their database. I'm not sure what kind of a process is required to do this, as I haven't for selfish reasons"
538489,addy79,2011-01-12 19:35:00,573,"so, you cant simply add an updated file to the existing card? is there an updated map card coming out next year with more lakes that I should've waited for??"
