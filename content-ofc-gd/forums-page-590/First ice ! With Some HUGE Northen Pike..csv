537745,Fishing 24/7,2011-01-11 02:10:00,709,"  Snowed for 2 days none stop up in the wakefield hillz!    Met the Boyz at TIMz! and off we went.   monster pike hunt.  I was the lucky one....    The plan was in the back of my head since late fall.  i found the mother load of a pike hot spot. There territory.  Every pike lake has one spot where they school up .  Find it and you will be in HEAVEN!  I brake the ice With a 8.8 lbs pike.  DOHS.. (dead on hook set) but i didnt cry for long... SUPPER!        The day went out like this.  Every 15 minutes a pike would hit a line.  Back and forth it was . Me then ROB then rob... then me ,rob then ROB!  It Was Insanity!  This is how you set a hook.... King Kong style!     CMON MAN!  Check this out SON!    Isnt this the most amazing shot youv ever seen?  Then ROB takes the stand...... FISH ON!  This guy was a HAPPY man beating his PB thrice!    BACK IT UP MAN! too tight!      After landing his first .. ROB gets the brilliant idea to put a sucker minnow on a buck shot........... i was like WHAT THE  :shock:  Fish on!    He pulled this fatty out....... :shock:  Today was my first day ice fishing and it was a HECK of a day.  Here are a couple of extras!    Love the loomis on this shot!..  never play with your food ?     DA MOUTH!    And none the less..... LE BRRRACKET!    Nothing like safe ice sunny day and a HELL of a day pike fishing!  Today i was lucky enough to have my good friend Rob with me.  This guy has a SWEET blog all anglers should check out!  For tip and techniques  , what to look for when pike fishing.  anything and everything. just pure knowledge!  http://rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.blogspot.com/2011/01/pike-storm-in-quebec.html   PLAY SAFE!"
