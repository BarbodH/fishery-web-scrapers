536799,livinisfishin,2011-01-09 00:52:00,661,I am going to ottawa next weekend and I am looking for some information on some possible locations to take my friend. I remember a couple years ago we were walking up the rideau but I don't know if there would be enough ice on there yet. Thanks guys
536808,mercman,2011-01-09 01:05:00,7054,"if you are looking to rent, Oziles in the east end Orleans is great i hear. If you want to be outside on the ice, try Shirleys Bay in the west end,out in Kanata."
536814,Leecher,2011-01-09 01:13:00,7832,I live on the other side of the Ottawa and both Ottawa R & Gatineau R are open water in the middle..... I can't speak for the Rideau R but would imagine some parts being open.... Sorry can't help you there  Only thing frozen is the back bays and lakes but I'd be extra careful. Leechman
536817,mercman,2011-01-09 01:20:00,7054,wow !! that must be a first Jacques.Guess the mild weather must be really messing things up for ice fishing.
536818,livinisfishin,2011-01-09 01:21:00,661,I kinda figured we will have to leave the city..ill have to look online for some bait shops in ottawa and give them a call
536827,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-09 01:31:00,2038,Shirley's Bay is Producing some walleye and Crappie of late..and there are a couple of huts out on 8 to 10 inches of ice   When you get to Ottawa .......pm me and i'll give you more details on some other spots
536830,livinisfishin,2011-01-09 01:35:00,661,"Thanks a lot I'm happy with those conditions.. Wish I knew what part of ottawa I'm going to, is shirleys bay a far drive from around carelton university?"
536833,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-09 01:41:00,2038,  15 to 20 minutes
536834,livinisfishin,2011-01-09 01:43:00,661,Perfect .. I will definitely pm u later on. Thanks a lot!
536837,livinisfishin,2011-01-09 01:47:00,661,I guess my last question is what is the name for a bait shop in that area?
536838,Leecher,2011-01-09 01:47:00,7832," Yeah Paul before New Year, it was frozen but the mild temp put a damper on it for sure     but I'm not targeting the river"
536840,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-09 01:50:00,2038,     But i'll look in to it
536923,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-09 04:19:00,140,"Not to infringe on this board,but you could check out fish-hawk.net which is an Ottawa area fishing board. There is some info on there."
536927,irishfield,2011-01-09 04:21:00,26272,You could also cast open water right at Carleton Jason.. under the Bronson St Bridge.. there's eyes in there..
539243,livinisfishin,2011-01-14 12:55:00,661,Well leaving tonight and fishing tomorrow. Any last minute ideas or things I should know?  Thanks
