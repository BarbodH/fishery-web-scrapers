539143,Gregoire,2011-01-14 02:40:00,1397,"I went out on the weekend on the ice for the first time. I wish I could post a report but I got skunked. Anyway, I was just wondering if either of these things have ever happened to you: My skimmer broke as I was using it. Just shattered. I'll be purchasing a metal one for the next trip. My reel froze up. I thought it was broken, but when I got her warmed up she was working fine. Just wondering what I can do to stop this from happening again."
539145,irishfield,2011-01-14 02:41:00,26272,Pull the cover off and clean out all the cheap grease they use. Give it a light spray or a dab of oil. The grease froze on you is all..
539148,Sinker,2011-01-14 02:43:00,8692,"I have had reels freeze lots of times. It happens. Those cheap plastic skimmers suck too, get a metal one and your good to go.  Keep your reel out of the slush/snow around your hole.  S."
539150,Gerritt,2011-01-14 02:45:00,6129,"Mind if I ask... what reel?.. and yeah the plastic skimmers will break.. that is why redwolf sells em for 1.99  Wayne offers good advice. Be sure not to leave a warm reel in the snow, as it will freeze, an d try  not to get it wet  G"
539189,Gregoire,2011-01-14 04:04:00,1397,the reel was a shimano sedona
539193,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-14 04:09:00,10439,"Yep, I've had em freeze up. As said, remove side cover, remove grease and replace with Quantum Hot Sauce, go fish."
539195,toca,2011-01-14 04:11:00,274,had quantum hot sauce sort of stick on me a couple of times in late november.
539197,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-14 04:14:00,10439, I run my Quantum PTI's in -40 with no issues.
539198,BillM,2011-01-14 04:18:00,17367,"If the reel freezes up just stick it inside your floater suit for 5mins or so, it will thaw out.  Try to also not lay it in the snow or on the ice."
539266,Sinker,2011-01-14 13:57:00,8692,"Sometimes there will be a bit of moisture inside the reel that will freeze the guts on you. If I get mine wet, I put them by the fire all night so they're nice and dry the next time I use them.  Taking the cover off and checking things out is the best way to know for sure what's going on.  S."
539272,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-14 14:10:00,3761,"Never had problems with my Symetre yet. As for the skimmer I like those plastic things, they work good for me. I think I'm the only person that can get a full fishing season out of one"
539280,hammercarp,2011-01-14 14:22:00,964,I used snow mobile low temp grease on ice fishing reels. Works great. So if you know a sledder go get a teaspoon of it off them.
539289,limeyangler,2011-01-14 14:46:00,5204,  LOL...yeah...what Gerrit said....and dont drop it in your minnow bucket either...lol...dunno who'd do that
539335,fishermccann,2011-01-14 16:23:00,655,"I just buy a strainer from the dollar store, cheap, last all year and in diff. sizes for your holes"
539360,Beans,2011-01-14 17:19:00,3339,I use an aquarium net from the pet store for removing ice chips from the hole and keep it in my minnow pail to keep from freezing up and for scooping out a minnow...they are much stronger than the nets they sell in tackle stores and do a much cleaner job than the plastic scoops...  Keep your reel off of snow...
