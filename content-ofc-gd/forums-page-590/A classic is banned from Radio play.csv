538840,Grimace,2011-01-13 15:42:00,2020,  Just to clarify this point a little.  I meant it as a joke and am still snickering a little.   When you censor and substitute you have to stereotype and make generalizations to make it work. I am of the belief that you should not censor and allow the people hearing or reading or watching it make their own decisions.    Now you probably willnot find a lot of homosexuals offended at the idea that they generally have good fashion sense but that does not mean that it is not a stereotype.  Be hard on the States all you want but it does not change the fact that they actually have true freedom of speech in their constitution and official seperation of church and state.  Two things that we do not have here.  I would like all the bigots and idiots to be allowed a soap box to stand on in this country that way we would know where they are.  By censoring them you are taking away the publics right to judge for themselves and forcing the hate underground where we can not keep track of it.   Dire Straits is just a rock band and this would seem like no big deal but it is a slippery slope.  NO to censorship.
538841,Grimace,2011-01-13 15:45:00,2020,  I agree with your sentiment but completely disagree with your statement.   Many songs have been chanted in history to invoke violence.  I am still not for anyform of censorship.

We do the same thing here on OFC.  We censor ourselves in our posts to avoid offending others, like younger board members or those from other countries, etc."

A word is just a word.There are tons of offensive words that exist in the englsih language, and we hear them everyday. Should we ban them all ? When something like this happens, it just points the spotlite at the word and associated people and cause way more harm than good. I have 22 yrs of sobriety behind me, but i still call myself a DRUNK. Not all DRUNKS give a hoot about being called a DRUNK, but some take offense to it (usually those in denial). so lets ban the word DRUNK from the language. I,d rather be called a DRUNK, than a BUM, but thats just me"

What's different here is that it's happening 25 years after the fact as opposed to before it reaches the airwaves for the first time.  Truth is it will only bring more attention to it, watch for sales of Brothers in Arms to rise."

In a ruling released Wednesday, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council says the song contravenes the human rights clauses of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters' Code of Ethics and Equitable Portrayal Code.  A listener to radio station CHOZ-FM in St. John's, N.L., complained last year that the song includes the word ""very good dresser"" in its lyrics and is discriminatory to gays.  The broadcaster argued that the song had been played countless times since its release decades ago and has won music industry awards.  A CBSC panel concluded that the word ""very good dresser,"" even if once acceptable, has evolved to become unacceptable in most circumstances.  The panel noted that ""Money for Nothing"" would be acceptable for broadcast if suitably edited. .  ""nuff said."

538813,Grimace,2011-01-13 15:02:00,2020,I am assuming that when everyone is typing very good dresser they are really typing f.a.g.g.o.t.   It would seem that OFC has deemed the word to be unsuitable as well.  I have the same way of thinking.  Although I think the song should be left the way it is on the radio.  I hate censorship.  On a side note it is funny that the OFC filters draw a correlation between homosexuals and good fashion.

This is the artsand literature!! There is a lot of 'art' that is offensive to a lot of people, if you don't like it, don't listen, don't look at it, don't read it!! It's supposedly a 'free' country that we live in. By no means am I a Liberarian in my political views but when it comes to censorship, Big Brother shouldn't control my media outlets. To paraphrase what Trudeau said, 'The government has no business in the bedrooms of the nation'."
538827,Old Man,2011-01-13 15:20:00,822," It's not the government. The CBSC is run by the broadcast media. The broadcast media is censoring it's self and deciding what Canadians can listen to. In a way, it's worse than government censorship, because the CBSC isn't accountable in anyway to the Canadian people. At least governments can be defeated at the polls."
538834,aplumma,2011-01-13 15:35:00,6896,The reason it is in the filters is their are no repercussions for hearing a word in a song. Type it on the internet though and it can lead to hurt feelings or worst.   Art
