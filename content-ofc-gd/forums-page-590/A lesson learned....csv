538164,irishfield,2011-01-11 23:19:00,26272,That'll buff right out...
538165,fishing n autograph,2011-01-11 23:19:00,2540,Wow..... That's why I cut my own hair lol
538166,Pikeslayer,2011-01-11 23:23:00,1443,Mrs Pikeslayer cut Pikeslayer Jrs hair when he was about 7 years old. Poor boy was traumatized for weeks
538167,Terry,2011-01-11 23:26:00,14456,don't let any kids see it  they will all want their hair like that.....
538168,bigugli,2011-01-11 23:27:00,6138,I get the son to clip the back of my head. No way I'm trusting the Mrs. Too much temptation there   You got off light.

538241,kickingfrog,2011-01-12 01:35:00,8333,I think maybe someone fell asleep on the couch one too many times after a long fishing trip.

538340,Tarzan's Jane,2011-01-12 11:51:00,1183,I like that the strip is inches longer than it needed to be     Bald is much better!
538341,cranks bait,2011-01-12 12:09:00,721,"LOL, I know exactly how you feel.  I have had this done to me by my ex.  Mine was straight up the middle of the back. I left it as a conversation piece.  Getting out of the shower rubbing my hair dry reminded me of having a toothbrush and tongue scrubber....."
538355,Headhunter,2011-01-12 13:27:00,5703,Right down to the wood! Watch out for splinters! HH
538357,Spiel,2011-01-12 13:32:00,9065,"LOL....Beauty!  Been there, done that and the person at the controls was ......... me. Somehow the #2 attachment fell off and I had a nice bare strip up the back of my head, no choice but to go bare melon."
538379,Harrison,2011-01-12 14:39:00,2202,"Had the same thing done to me for hockey initiation.  Except I had hair to my shoulders and they made 3 lines like that in the front, back, and one side.  Couldn't get a hair cut for a month.  Needless to say, that was the easy part of the initiation.  Get out the BIC bud."
538585,Motorhead,2011-01-12 23:53:00,163,"Girlfriend did the same thing to me.... I usually do my own hair a couple of times a year, everything but the back of the neck to straighten it out... Get her to do it and all I hear is a couple of giggles... I ask her ""what did you do"" and get a ""Nothing"" and a few more giggles... look in the mirror and I now have a nice diagonal slash about 2 1/2 inches up the back of my neck...  Oh Well... LOL  I was told long ago... the only difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is 3 days...  I`d leave it as is....  Doug"
