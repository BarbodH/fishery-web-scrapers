538533,DoubleDigits,2011-01-12 21:59:00,140,This is one of the best posts I've seen on any fishing site. You are a good fisherman and a GREAT POET!! I can't decide which poem is the best... they are all awesome.  One of my faves:  Salmon The King Chinook may give us a fight But the Coho is a beautiful sight We have the Pink and the Atlantic But Lets not get in a frantic They're all in the Lakes for us to see except for the Sockeye which lives in the sea

I'm stunned     Those are some great memories as far as keeping a log  This one is hung up in my office too, real close to where I sit    And keep telling anyone coming in that I'm contagious and to not provoke me Thanks for sharing Jacques"
538713,msp,2011-01-13 04:00:00,1336,"I thought that was cool to look at. You had some great days out on the water. We should all do something like that. It seems that all the days on the water seem to blend together and I cant remember which day was which. My favorite poem that made me laugh..... Perch ""Get the skillet and the butter Ill go call my Dad and Mother Hi I got the butter in the hot skillet So come on over and have some Perch fillets"""
538731,misfish,2011-01-13 11:04:00,29133,"Thanks guys.  Thought I would share.   Mike I pretty much lived and breathed it back then.Browns mostly.After the last year of that book,I was probly gone every weekend. Loved the niagara area. We would leave at 3 am just so we could stand at the Dam in deluise (sp?) The walk up and down from the whirlpool was always an adventure. Believe it or not,I used the same rod and reel for all those years. 12 hellbender and a black cardnial 3.Still have it,except a few inches shorter.  Thanks again.  Im trying to find a few boxes that contain pics,of the niagara area."
