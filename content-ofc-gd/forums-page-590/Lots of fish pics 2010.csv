538821,mepps,2011-01-13 15:10:00,1301,Awesome season brother! Love to see those TO pike!
538914,majorlifts,2011-01-13 18:40:00,171," Hey thanks for the info on the Harbor license, this has always been a big debate and now the record is set strait."
538372,WeedLine,2011-01-12 14:22:00,322,Some better fish of 2010. All fish were released except 1 female brown. All fish were caught within 300km of Toronto.  I love ice fishing but can't wait for open water again. Good luck to everyone in 2011. Fish hard or stay home                      [i MG]http://i365.photobucket.com/albums/oo96/fishfinder1977/010.jpg[/img]      Put my buddy onto his first pike. It's gonna be a hard one for him to beat. 15 mins into the day!      Fatso      Self timer shots during a solo mission                 Got this one casting a jerk bait in 9 fow fishing for pike and largies.    
538397,majorlifts,2011-01-12 15:20:00,171,"FANTASTIC!!!!! I love it, I have fished that pike location for a long time and had the same success, seeing those pics gets me wild with Pike fever, but in recent years had trouble getting out in the boat, mostly due to the fact that my buddy insists that you must have a harbor permit to fish there, or even cross to this location. (the one with Toronto skyline). Those Pike are still there!! and so many to be caught! This is truly a great post! and the pics are flawless.  Although my buddy would argue that keeping a log of conditions, time n date would be a waste, I differ, because for the life of both of us, neither can remember exactly those things, (which I'm sure he would argue to the death) this has made a couple of our previous attempts unsuccessful. Maybe 2011 will be our year. Thanks again."
538399,highdrifter,2011-01-12 15:21:00,2534,"Holly buckets!!  Mike sure can take some sweet pics..  I'm gonna have to kill you though.  What a great year.  Hope your 2011 is even better!!  BAH, who am I kidding, I hope your 2011 sucks donkeys."
538406,majorlifts,2011-01-12 15:28:00,171,"Don`t worry, Erik and I have posted many pics of the like, and it hasn't changed the traffic in decades. Its all for posterity."
538407,mercman,2011-01-12 15:28:00,7054,"wow !!!!!!!!!!!! great fish, but the bass and the pike are HUGE !!!!!!!!!!!!! both my favorite fish.  Thanks for sharing them  !  Paul"

538423,Harrison,2011-01-12 16:32:00,2202,"Bud, you really have to try and get out more.  Obviously single, and if not, soon to be.  Epic report.  Well done, really like the ""Flippin Jig Smallmouths"" (name of my bar btw) And who puts flappin shads on jigs....sheesh!  One of dudes in the pics named Sean?"

538482,solopaddler,2011-01-12 19:13:00,8605,"I can appreciate someone who takes the initiative to master multi species, well done.  Nice array of fish!"
538507,PikeMolester,2011-01-12 20:50:00,428,absolutely amazing. I'm from Montreal and wanna take trips to some Ontario lakes. What lake are those bass pics from? (can send in a PM)
538552,WeedLine,2011-01-12 22:37:00,322,"Hey guys/gals, thanks for the replys. I really don't know what I'm doing and still have lots to learn. I just put in time and try to fish with confidence when i am fishing. You wont know if you don't go. Dude, the operater of the boat must have a valid harbour license while in the harbour, canals and spit. Myself and MSP have one. It is a day course with practicle test in a small boat with the examiner. There are many NO BOAT ZONES around the islands because of the island airport. We have been stoped and checked a few times. Hey Harrison, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years this fall but not because of fishing. I have never had so much action in my life as now. I feel like Jack Tripper when he has 3 dates on the same night. I mainly fish on Saturdays because i'm busy with work. You gotta see how those flappin shads work for ice lakers. I always experiment with baits and customize them. I cut off the weed guard when icefishing with flipping jigs. Sean is my cousin Nick's buddy. He joined us on an annual trip to Pointe au Baril. He was so drunk when he caught that pike. He hadn't caught a fish since he was 13 years old. He Hopped in the boat with me and within 20 mins he caught that momma. He didn't even know he had it on. I told him to set the hook and start reeling."
538561,Harrison,2011-01-12 23:02:00,2202,Well. If you are talking Loumankis we are family in a weird way. We have have to get out together.  We smoke lakers on the bar with flappin shads.  We were with Gambler for a few years. Love their baits.
538575,Rich Clemens,2011-01-12 23:34:00,3131,Sweet.   I'll best teams will be after you when the OFC tournament fires up this year.   Great season ya had.
