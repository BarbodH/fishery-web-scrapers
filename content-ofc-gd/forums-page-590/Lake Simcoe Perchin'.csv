I've been getting lots of good fish in the 35-44 foot range.  Fishing this past week has been especially good and my belly is full!  Beer battered perch is never a bad choice I must say.  All fish coming on artificials... jigging raps, bloodworm and scud patterns as well. Hope to venture for some lakers/whiteys soon.  Good fishin everyone! Stay Dry!   "
