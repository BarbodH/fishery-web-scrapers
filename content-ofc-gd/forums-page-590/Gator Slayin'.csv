537366,bottombouncer,2011-01-10 10:30:00,21,congrats on some nice looking gators!
537373,solopaddler,2011-01-10 11:58:00,8605,"Holy cow, are you finally getting dialed in up there? That's awesome bud!  Keep that up and you'll be bailing on the Attawapiskat trip.  Gerritt was right though. A pic of the fish all battered up and frying in oil is the OFC money shot!"
537384,corvette1,2011-01-10 12:54:00,1765,awesome pike thats a lake to try in the spring
537410,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-10 14:15:00,3761,"Now those are some Pike! Got to get my self somewhere where I'll catch big pike like that consistently.  Awesome job and thanks for sharing, MTBF"
537436,Rich,2011-01-10 15:25:00,3927,Nice gators for sure! Thanks for the report!
537456,Terry,2011-01-10 16:31:00,14456,some mighty fine fish there
537459,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 16:42:00,10439,  Already have plans for that. It's an easy 100 yard portage off the big lake. I want to head in there with my inflatable and see what happens.
537460,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 16:46:00,10439," Starting to. Just been trying different lakes. So many lakes so little time. So far this winter I have fished a total of 5 new lakes. I think I will be heading back there next weekend.  Nah, no bailing for me. I already gots my plane ticket.  Poike's are fer catchin', troots are fer eatin'."
538331,Moosebunk,2011-01-12 06:37:00,3970,"Some great pike Dave.  Sleek.  Betcha that lake will get another visit, and they should fatten up too in the coming while.  Just cause I got a bud out there, I gotta ask a couple... what do you use for bait, or what's best up there?  Do you use a flasher at all too?  I'll keep an eye out for the annual winter laker tour you do."
538429,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-12 16:50:00,10439,  Bunk Dead sticked cisocoes worked best but I also caught fish on airplane jigs and spoons tipped with shiners/smaller ciscoes.  As for the flaseh......................you bet!!! Wouldn't go anywhere with out my Marcum LX-5.  Still waiting on the mining ice roads to open for Trout Tour 2011 to start.
538462,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-12 17:48:00,655,"Wow, great pike. Must have been a riot through a hole"
538486,Moosebunk,2011-01-12 19:22:00,3970,  Pretty much same set-ups I used too.  Just didn't need the sonar.  My buddy up there needs to adapt his fishing to how we know it.  He often goes home fishless.  12-13 years I figure the north will be calling me back.  You're in a good place Dave and you know it.
538517,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-12 21:32:00,10439,"  Without the flasher how would I know where to drill in the first place? I  clear a patch of snow off the ice, put my transducer on the ice and pour a little water out of a water bottle I bring along over the transducer. The water couples the transducer to the ice alowing me to tell what the water depth is before I drill.  It also makes a big difference when jigging too. We saw a lot of fish that would come in and look but not bite until you teased them a bit. Without the flasher we would not even have known they were there. This probably accounted for 6 or 8 fish over the day. 25% to 33% of our catch was made possible because of the flasher.  I have been out close to a dozen times this winter and only got skunked once and that was the first time out this winter and only because I could not get to the water I wanted to fish due to dangerously thin ice."
537249,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 01:13:00,10439,"Got out to another new lake today and had some great action. I've been driving over this lake for several years on my way to other lakes and have never fished it..........until today. Todays target would be pike, and I had been told that this lake was a goodun'. Well I was not disapointed. We pulled onto the lake and picked out a fishy looking spot and drilled 1/2 dozen holes covering water from 6 to 15 FOW and dropped baits. It didn't take long before I got my first fish of 2011, a decent 30 incher.    Shortly after this on I got another an inch or so shorter and then a few little guys. But the big ones were lurking as I had one attack one of the small ones I landed. My buddy managed this nice 36 incher as well as several in the 24 to 30 inch range and a bunch of smaller fish.    I got a bunch in the 24 to 30 inch range as well as a couple of 40 inch class brutes. This big girl came on a tipup in the first hour of the day.    And this leviathon came later in the day on a dead sticked ciscoe on a quick strike rig. She taped out at about 44 inches.    Got plans to hit this spot again real soon."
537251,Grimace,2011-01-10 01:15:00,2020,Nice.  How many feet of ice did you have to drill through?
537256,alphaalpha,2011-01-10 01:26:00,475,"beauty fish, nice work!"
537258,Dutchy,2011-01-10 01:29:00,416,Nice looking pike. Great job!
537259,spincast,2011-01-10 01:31:00,3279,"Ok, I could fish for that on hard water - nice gators. But just out of curiosity, the temp was?"
537260,ctdd2006,2011-01-10 01:32:00,531,Nice stuff!  Warm day??? No jackets???  :dunno:
537261,mercman,2011-01-10 01:32:00,7054,nice Gators.You Better fish that spot again !!! Looks like it produces monsters.   Paul
537264,Dondorfish,2011-01-10 01:39:00,1000,Nicely done!     - Thanks for the post.   Tracker (Don)
537265,irishfield,2011-01-10 01:44:00,26272,Nice way to put in them short days Dave !
537266,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 01:45:00,10439," -16 and about -22 with the wind.     2 1/2 to 3 feet    Jackets are for wusses!!!! Actually I just ran out of the Frabill to get one of the set lines. It's quite comfortable in the hut with the 14,000 BTU sunflower heater blasting."

537274,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 02:05:00,10439,  Bet you don't. My favorite lake is 400 miles North of here.
537278,Rod Caster,2011-01-10 02:14:00,5784,Well done Drifter..those are some impressive Northerns!  
537280,Gerritt,2011-01-10 02:24:00,6129,And where are the pictures of them fried up crispy with a side of chips?
537282,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 02:29:00,10439, All were released to fight another day.
537304,WeedLine,2011-01-10 03:00:00,322,"That looks like such a good time. I can't wait to get big northerns like those through the ice. You have a good spot there. Just think of how well you will do there after a few more trips and more exploring. Make sure to go there for late/last ice. Keep the reports coming, I want to see more giants."
537310,LefroyFisherman,2011-01-10 03:06:00,602,"Very nice Gators, so jealous"

537319,BUSTER,2011-01-10 03:15:00,1336,Some day I'll make it up there  ...Nice catch
537340,Gregoire,2011-01-10 04:05:00,1397,Great report. I'm jealous that you get to fish for monsters durng the hardwater season. Your post makes me even more depressed about getting skunked today.

537349,Smarty Pantz,2011-01-10 04:28:00,203,"  Got skunked today too   Great fish drifter, I'm in WoW   44 incher is a beauty   "
537354,Roy,2011-01-10 04:48:00,13728,Luscious looking lucius there Dave! Thanks for sharing your outing and the great pics. Ummm is it just me or is the scenery getting bigger or are you getting smaller? Seems you might have lost a few kilos eh? Pounds also?
537357,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 05:04:00,10439, Scenery isn't getting any bigger I'm just not blocking so much of it any more. I've dropped over 60#'s so far.
