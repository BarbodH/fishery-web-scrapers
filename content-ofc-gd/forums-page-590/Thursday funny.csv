Thinking quickly, the other boy takes his stick, wedges it down the dog's collar and twists, breaking the  dog's neck.  A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident, and rushes over to interview the boy. ""Young Leafs Fan Saves Friend From Vicious Animal,"" he starts writing in his notebook.  ""But I'm not a Leafs fan,"" the little hero replied. ""Sorry, since we are in Toronto, I just assumed you were,"" said the reporter and starts again.  ""Little Jays Fan Rescues Friend From Horrific Attack"" he continued writing in his notebook.  ""I'm not a Jays fan either,"" the boy said ""I  assumed everyone in Toronto was either a Leafs or Jays fan. ""What  team, do you root for?"" the reporter asked.  ""I'm a Montreal Canadiens fan."" the child said. The reporter starts  a new sheet in his notebook and writes,  ""Little French bugger from Montreal Kills Beloved Family Pet.""     ryan"
