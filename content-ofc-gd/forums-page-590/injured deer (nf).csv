538170,fishcrisp,2011-01-11 23:28:00,17,Took a hike in the rouge today and came across a deer that was lying down on some reeds across the river and was bleeding from its mouth or chest. The river is not frozen over so i could not get any closer to the deer to see exactly what was wrong with him.The deer was alert but for the hour i was watchin him he never got up once..

538294,gone_fishin,2011-01-12 03:25:00,481, I'm sure the coyotes have already taken care of it....
538342,fishcrisp,2011-01-12 12:19:00,17,Gonna try to get to the otherside of the river today... I have heard of illegal hunting in the rouge and i wanna see if its got a bow in its chest.
