537883,fishhunter,2011-01-11 11:54:00,604,DANO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF BED ITS ICE FISHING SEASON!!   IT WAS ONE THING TO LOOSE YOU ON OUR FALL TRIP BUT NOT WINTER TOO.   I MAY JUST HAVE TO COME UP AND KICK YOUR ASS A FEW TIMES.   TELL YOUR BETTER HALF TO LOOK AFTER YOU BETTER
537891,lew,2011-01-11 12:42:00,12766,"Best of luck & hope you recover soon Dano, sounds like you've been having a tough time for awhile now."
537912,RandyLinden,2011-01-11 13:55:00,40,"Hi Dano Thought I'd share my experiance... I'm not sure what happened to you to cause the infection but I just went thru a similar situation. My knee did not look quite as bad as yours but Over 2YEARS ago I had a very routine orthoscopic surgery done on my left knee (walk in walk out) within a couple of days I was back at the hospital with a severley swollen knee (could not bend the knee at all) After more than 3 weeks in the hospital and another operation (to find out what went wrong) they finally diagnosed the cause of the infection (VRE positive, some kind of hospital based infection) I then had pic lines and IV's along with IV pump connected for over 2 months requiring nursing attention to change IV's and maintaining the pic lines at least twice a day. The infection eventually subsided and even with physio therapy twice a week my knee is still not back to normal but I am thankfull that I am not undergoing treatment for the infection any more and that I am now able to walk without crutches. I have a good idea of what you are going thru. I missed fishing most of all. Dano You will get over the hump and it will improve, hang in there, one day at a time... it will be a long battle just keep fighting and tuff it out... Once they get the meds sorted out you will experiance improvement.. Best wishes and hang in there."
537916,bigbuck,2011-01-11 14:02:00,2449,Hopefully they lick this thing and you'll be back out there washing lures in the summer. Hang in there!!
537922,Headhunter,2011-01-11 14:14:00,5703,"Holy crap Dano... I knew you were having some challenges, but my God, that's friggin brutal! Sounds like the Doc's are starting to find the right track for your recovery... it will take time, heck, it took this much time for you to get where you are now, so stay patient and get better... we have some Perch to put a hurtin on! I'll add you to the list of nightly thoughts and look forward to hearing that you are on the mend! BTW - it's way past time!!! HH"
537947,Dano,2011-01-11 14:57:00,719,"Thank you all so very much, you dont know how much this means to me. It has been a frustrating road and reading this has certainly lifted my spirits. I am at Ferns place now and she is doing a fine job of being a nurse but I find it difficult as I am quite an independent individual who hates being a burden for anyone though she insists she doesnt mind, I am a very fortunate man that way. I feel lucky to have my friends here too, and thank you all again for the prayers and thoughts."
537948,irishfield,2011-01-11 14:59:00,26272,Did ya want me to have a nurses outfit delivered bud??? (or does she already have one..)  
537967,fishing n autograph,2011-01-11 15:31:00,2540,those are brutal. a friend of mine got a staph infection and was off work and quaranteened for several months....best of luck Dano! get better
538009,TennesseeGuy,2011-01-11 17:44:00,957,"Dano, best to you in fighting this one.  Be nice to your knee.  Give it a chance to heal."
538038,aplumma,2011-01-11 18:59:00,6896,Keep the faith Dan their are a lot of fish calling your name. I pray that the Doctors have the knowledge and the tools to heal you as soon as possible.   Art
538058,Dano,2011-01-11 19:38:00,719,"Thanks again everyone. I have to share this with you. I just woke up from one of my fever induced ""naps"" and the only dream I can recall is that a bunch of us were ice fishing up north (the usual cast of characters + a bunch more) off of Waynes dock and we tied into a school of walleye, one after another, everyone was catching them. I can guaratee I wouldnt have had that sweet dream had it not been for this thread. Thanks to Wayne & all who replied once again.  Wayne, hold off on that nurse uni untill I am better please as I have no energy for even that these days..."
538065,corvette1,2011-01-11 20:07:00,1765,get well soon
538230,RandyLinden,2011-01-12 01:18:00,40,Hey Dano Don't Feel Bad for leaning on your friends.... That's what real friends are for and what real friends do and it's your turn to do the leaning... Hang in there... It will get better... like most things time is the key... keep your head up... You will start to feel better... even though it looks like it is taking forever... I bet showers are a real struggle and a pain with the pic line....I remember it was so good to have a shower but keeping the knee waterproof and the pic line waterproof was a major problem and often it was even better just getting back to bed... Hope you start to feel better soon...!!!!  Randy
538251,Cookslav,2011-01-12 01:56:00,1457,"Take care Dano, thats a hell of a thing to deal with for that long. Prayer sent.  Get well soon"

538699,icefisherman,2011-01-13 03:18:00,952,"Sorry to read it Wayne...Dano is sure a great guy....still remember the BOQ cottage we shared with him and you... Wish him good luck fighting the bacterium and would love to see him fishing soon...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
537752,irishfield,2011-01-11 02:18:00,26272,"I hinted at it the other day, but those of us that know have all kept quiet. Dano's been fighting an infection in his leg since late last winter. He wasn't able to come to the lake over the summer and hasn't been able to basically work since spring.  He's had an IV pic in him since spring and was on one anitibiotic drip that he was going in once or twice a day to have administered. Everytime his leg seemed to be clearing up they'd take him off the drip and next day he'd be right back in emerg swollen and red again and the best they could tell him is that it was an MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans).  They did a biopsy.. pics attached.. and then determined he was on the wrong drug. So since November he's been on something else.. three times a day he had to go in and have a bag hooked up. We'll FORTUNATELY for Dan he also has an annual colonospy and when having it done last week the Dr that was doing so realized that he was allergic to what they were giving him for the infection and Dan was within a few days of dying from it!  Dan is currently lying in the hospital texting me back and forth.. he's even had a priest in today to lay his hands on him (and I checked with him to make sure it wasn't a catholic priest..) The drug they had him on... turns out he was allergic to that as well. They have tried a few other things the last two days and he's now too sensitive, so they have to let his system flush before they try anything else.  Dano is the best fishing partner a guy could ever ask for... he cooks and does dishes.... so please folks, like I asked in another thread recently, a few prayers, thoughts or howling at the moon as we want the lad healthy so he can get back to running his business and out for a long deserved bit of fishing!
