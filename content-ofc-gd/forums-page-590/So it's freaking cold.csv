538859,skeeter,2011-01-13 16:22:00,1907,I didnt know igloo's had heat.  why are homes built without a drain valve for just this reason?
538860,Beans,2011-01-13 16:26:00,3339,Brrrrrrr...that's not good !  I use my wood stove for just such emergencies and the odd recreational fire...   
538867,aplumma,2011-01-13 16:33:00,6896,If you are still home and don't have heat allow the faucets to run at a fast drip/tiny thin stream to keep them from freezing.   Art

So, at the end of the day, there is a lot to be said for consistancey! On the up side, ice for your drink will not be a problem! See, there's a silver lining behind every cloud! HH"
538962,aplumma,2011-01-13 20:14:00,6896,  Well that puts a kink in my approach...If it starts to get to cold you can turn off the pump if it is a jet pump and open the cap on top to drain back the house. Make sure you open all of the faucets hot and cold to allow it to drain.   Art
538968,mercman,2011-01-13 20:22:00,7054,Man thats serious....really.I sure hope you dont have to be a long time without power. Once the shrink factor gets a hold of you.......
