538323,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-12 05:20:00,835,A careless duck hunter introduced the stuff and now its choking the bay to the point where you can't get a boat out. Any ideas?

538349,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-12 13:02:00,4399,I don`t know the rules and regs regarding water ways but I would imagine you would have to talk the Ministry about anything to do with the water and whats in it!
538352,Jer,2011-01-12 13:16:00,1426,"It's definetely on the spread in the Tri-Lakes. In the 15 years I've been here, I've seen huge expanses of water get all choked up. The worst is probably around Flood's Landing on Pigeon."
538376,irishfield,2011-01-12 14:28:00,26272,It's on the spread everywhere.. even Temagami. Wade and pull by the roots when nobody's looking....

538409,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-12 15:33:00,835,The hunter admitted to it. His neighbors aren't very happy with him.
538410,DanD,2011-01-12 15:34:00,2223,"Just did a google search and found this thing “The V’eed Cutter”. It looks like it could work pretty good and there seems to be quite a few outlets around Ontario that sells it. As someone else suggested; check with the Ministry, if it’s ok to cut the stuff down?

538498,Michael_Brown,2011-01-12 20:18:00,411,"Soya sauce.  Good luck getting rid of it. If you find a legal way, you could get rich.  Makes good duck hunting."
538506,Jer,2011-01-12 20:48:00,1426,"  I borrowed one of these from my neighbour (who borrowed it from a friend of his) last summer. Does a pretty good job, cleared most of my shoreline in a couple hours. Expensive though, he told me it cost over $200 at Home Hardware."
538508,chilli,2011-01-12 20:51:00,199,Why not just use herbicide?  Call the MNR and ensure they know there's a problem. And ya harvest the stuff. Wish I had close access to some and don't tell the freakin P3tah folks. Let em buy it from China and other morally superior places like they already do  I can understand why a hunter put it there but he never forecasted the big picture as in most cases of introduced species and he probably feels like an   .  This might even be a case for the invading species hotline http://www.invadingspecies.com/Report.cfm . Just because a plant is indigenous doesn't mean it belongs everywhere in Ontario.
538629,camillj,2011-01-13 01:33:00,1988,Toss a can of corn and watch the natural foragers clean it all up for ya .. gets little muddy at first ... but they do a great job of uprooting pretty much everything in that area

538643,Big Cliff,2011-01-13 01:51:00,6899,"Harvest and send to Big Cliff, mixed with brown rice it makes a super stuffing for foul. It is worth about $8.00 a pound."
538644,basketclam,2011-01-13 01:52:00,115,"Sounds like this stuff is a big pain for boaters.  Anybody know of information available on how this stuff enhances/detracts from the quality of fish habitat (especially as a brood location, a hangout for forage fish or as shelter for young)?"
