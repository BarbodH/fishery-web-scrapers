I figure if I can find where the scuds are, then I can find some hungry white fish.  I did a little research, and it looks like scuds prefer the cover of rocks, or weeds in shallow water.  Up to a depth of 35'.  That doesn't sound much like the white fish grounds on Simcoe.  Does anyone have any insight on Simcoe scuds, and what type of habitat they would prefer specifically on lake Simcoe?  Scud = Fresh Water Shrimp..."
538405,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-12 15:25:00,0,Scuds are everywhere. Just like the fish.  Everythig eats them. I'd go with structure first and work from there. Don't forget the middle of the lake now.  It's a long friggin walk though.

However, how many of us can say they've caught whities in the weeds? I'm thinking it might be worth targetting the transition zones between weeds and harder bottom substrate and you may find whities on the prowl for bottom insects, just a guess. The other questions is what's the percentage of their diet? Is it 20% insects versus 80% minnows? I'm not sure, but if thats the case, it may be worth targeting areas with larger schools of baitfish instead of insects. Or it could be the other way around, 80% insects vs. 20% minnows, if thats the case, you may be on to something..."

Anywhere in 50-70 feet of water, of course you have to keep your perch as there bladders are blown out but oin the other hand the perch that cruise those deep flats seem to be larger then average. All the scuds I have found have been in shallower water on weeds I have pulled up. Like J-M says , try the transition depths in 30-50."

539039,Fisherman,2011-01-13 22:52:00,7201,"Grandpas and Grandmas only last so long, your day of ice fishing can wait."
539045,NAW,2011-01-13 23:03:00,4022," This is true.  The old guy is doing good.  My wife I are going to head up at noon for a visit, so I might as well hit the ice for the morning."
