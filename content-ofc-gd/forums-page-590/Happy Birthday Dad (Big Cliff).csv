Strange combination you're selling, the coffee I understand, but washroom supplies? You're not trying to cut my grass are you."

539002,Big Cliff,2011-01-13 21:25:00,6899,"Thank you all so much for the kind words, PMs, and text messages! Princess, thank you so much for the beautiful poem, I really enjoyed it!  I have been looking forward to this day for a long time, I feel like I am entering my second child hood, don't need a fishing license, the government sends me money every month just for being here, Sue keeps telling me to grow up and that I already have enough toys LOL.  Anyway, thanks again one and all, it really made my day!"

Love you Teressa  My Fishing Hole  I'm going down to my fishing hole, Got my tackle box, and fishing pole. Gonna catch a mess of fish for lunch, Fry em up in my pan, I love that crunch.  With a bitsy minnow on my line, I'll catch enough, so all can dine. Hoping for blue gills and sunfish too, I love fishing that's what I do.  I got a sandwich and a couple of beers, I do love fishing, I hold it dear. Look at this fishing hole, what a beautiful sight, Hold on, hold on now, I got a bite.  by Juan Olivarez"
