539069,tb4me,2011-01-13 23:56:00,3295,Nice Ride Wayne! Looking good..the truck that is Hey gotta love KD!! I too bought prepaid maintainance for my new dodge. Not a bad deal.
539080,GBW,2011-01-14 00:12:00,8460,"the CB was my next comment too!  HAHAHA  I was going to say ""if you had gone with a new Ram the CB that comes with it has a bracket under if to add your own 8-track player"""
539086,irishfield,2011-01-14 00:18:00,26272,I'm just glad there was enough camera flash that nobody can read the name of the artist on the 8 track in the player!! lol
539090,GBW,2011-01-14 00:47:00,8460,"my LCD and photoshop work well enough to see it was ""the bee gees"" - ""Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive""  "
539104,Muskieman,2011-01-14 01:13:00,2472,"  I had the opportunity to try a few from the lot last week...5.0 has TONS of power for such small C.I's ... as for the dipstick..being vertically challenged myself, I know what you mean.. just get a wheel step.. comes in very handy for checking my oil and putting stuff on the roof of my Expedition.   Randy "
539108,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-14 01:18:00,3761,Nice truck!
539109,walleyejigger,2011-01-14 01:22:00,876,"sweet ride, heard great things of these engines,  every time i go by the dealership lately it takes everything i got not to pull in with the deal they're having right now.  my truck is only 5 years old, and i expect another 3-5 years before i look again"
539135,Whopper,2011-01-14 02:21:00,2174,"Nice truck Wayne even though it's a Ford  I felt the same way when I bought a newer Silverado last October, my 02 has over 203,000 miles on it and the only thing besides regular maintenance was I had to replace a fuel pump at 180k and I still have it also.  Enjoy the new ride"
539192,fishnsled,2011-01-14 04:09:00,3520,SWEET RIDE!!  You'd think they could have hid the wires a bit better on the CB and 8-track though.
539196,GBW,2011-01-14 04:11:00,8460,
539231,Carp,2011-01-14 11:37:00,1488,"Very nice truck Wayne. If I was in the market for another pick up truck, Ford would definitely be at the top of the list."
539255,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 13:31:00,2690,"Nice ride, Wayne.  Would love to got that route, but, the fuel costs for my commute everyday would cut into my fishing tackle money!!!"
539274,Twocoda,2011-01-14 14:13:00,4130,nice ride...enjoy!...i think i still have some K-tel sound explosion 8 tracks around here somewhere...yours if ya want them ..

538942,irishfield,2011-01-13 19:38:00,26272,"YEP.. it's a Ford!! Save the ribbing as I bought it without hesitation. 8 years I got out of the last one with no major issues and I'm not easy on a truck, pulling the boat.. enclosed car trailer.. or a 34' triaxle float regularily. Nothing but basic maintenance and one cracked exhaust manifold were my total issues with that one. Once again I bought prepaid maintenance.. 5 years/100k for $1800 (and they added that into the price at 0% finance as well!). Paying up front for maintenance last time probably saved me about $3000 in maintenance bills during the first 4 years... as prepaid covers brake jobs to wiper blades. It also makes you take your truck in for service.. because you've already paid for it.. otherwise I'd probably drive it 'till it died without any service. "
538943,Spiel,2011-01-13 19:42:00,9065,"Looking good Wayne, congratualtions.  Must be a lift kit in her, eh......"
538944,Headhunter,2011-01-13 19:42:00,5703,There's some funny lookin guy standing in front of your new truck Wayne... kinda make it hard to see the thing! Enjoy your new ride... BTW - Metro had KD on sale by the case last week! HH
538945,irishfield,2011-01-13 19:43:00,26272,Na.. I'm just getting fatter again from sitting around in hospitals and eating junk food! lol
538946,Terry,2011-01-13 19:45:00,14456,very nice  0% finance saves a stack of money too   I wish my wife would stop spending all my money so I could afford a new one
538947,Spiel,2011-01-13 19:48:00,9065,"  For me it's from laying about doing nothing.....  Aside from that I'm happy for you Wayne, very nice truck and a great colour!"
538948,Rich Clemens,2011-01-13 19:50:00,3131,Good looking ride.   Picked up an F150 for myself last Spring.  Lew's got one.   Heck - we'll all have one soon.
538949,mercman,2011-01-13 19:53:00,7054, I picked up a 2010 Ranger last summer and love it. Ford makes great trucks.  Congrats Wayne.  'There somthin women like about a pick up man '
538953,GBW,2011-01-13 20:00:00,8460,did you get the upgarde and get the 8-track too?
538955,Spiel,2011-01-13 20:04:00,9065,  Hahahahahahahaha......
538956,Spiel,2011-01-13 20:05:00,9065,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.....
538958,Spiel,2011-01-13 20:06:00,9065,"But seriously, why would he spend the money, his ""Rumours"" tape has been ruined."
538960,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-13 20:12:00,4399,"Nice lookin truck Wayne and you gotta love the incentives right now too,my son bought a real nice F150 FX6 with a custom 6"" lift and 35"" Mickey Thompson`s this past summer. He loves it and calls it his Toyota cruncher!!!  Enjoy the new truck!"
538972,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-13 20:28:00,10439,That's nice but since yer savin' all that $$$$ you should have got one of these.  Just sayin'
538974,Muskieman,2011-01-13 20:32:00,2472,5.0 Wayne?
538999,bigbuck,2011-01-13 21:18:00,2449,You have 5 liter fever Wayne??? They are a nice truck!! Drive it in good health! I was up in Midland visiting friends in the area on New Year's Eve and took an F250Lariat with the new diesel at Bourgeois. What a truck!!! None of the Ford dealers around Oakville have any in stock. I took out the new Sierra HD with the new Duramax and didn't like the way it drove. The Ford was waaay nicer. I know what I'd buy for a truck. I'm kicking around the idea but we shall see how things go over the next year or so.
539001,lew,2011-01-13 21:24:00,12766,"Same truck as mine Wayne, including the XTR package, and your gonna be very happy with the way she rides and handles."
539004,BUSTER,2011-01-13 21:30:00,1336,"Congratulations on the new truck, great choice"
539010,Beans,2011-01-13 21:42:00,3339," Even I drive an Ford F150 (Enforcer) 1995...over 400,000 Kliks...LOL  She's a bugger on gas though...6.5 kilometers per litre (18 miles per impl. gallon)   "
539012,Rod Caster,2011-01-13 21:46:00,5784,Nice work horse... Those things are also like couches now days. I would have picked the same truck but the Mazda B4000 is all I need for now and Mazda was giving them away. 6000 off the top or 0%.
539016,irishfield,2011-01-13 21:58:00,26272, I'll do you one better... I got them to put a CB Radio in as well !!!! 
539017,irishfield,2011-01-13 22:01:00,26272,  Yes Randy.. the Coyote.. 302.. detuned for the trucks but still 360 HP !  Only thing that annoys me.. you have to get a stool to stand on to pull the dip stick to check the oil. They left it as is for the Mustang!
539027,Cudz,2011-01-13 22:34:00,2652,Rollin in my 5.0 with the ragtop down so my hair can blow.  The girlies on standby waiting just to say hi.  nice ride
539043,bushart,2011-01-13 23:00:00,2628,Here's the painter's new ride
