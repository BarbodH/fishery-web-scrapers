539336,Governator,2011-01-14 16:24:00,879,"I'm from the south end and Park Place is going to completely wreck havoc on Mapleview.  Also, it doesn't make sense to have future shop & best buy in the same lot.  Aren't they owned by the same company?"
539345,misfish,2011-01-14 16:47:00,29133," BPS being in a heavy traffic area has seen alot of quiet/dead days. Barrie has the traffic to support.Just think,drivers coming north bound will say,never mind BPS,Cabela,s is just up the hwy.LOL   Alot of northerns travel south to BP.Im thinking,a half the distance stop would get them in. Cripes,fisherman travels to Barrie to go to Princess Auto."
539350,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 16:58:00,5865,"Unlike BPS, I heard Cabela's requires about 40 acres before they will build. If you want to see a HUGE Cabela's take a trip to Hamburg, PA as that store is 265,000 sq feet....two restaurants in it...arrived there on a Sunday (last Feb) about 30 minutes after it opened and there was already about 300 cars in the parking lot. Very impressive store.  OH, best part...no tax on clothing....  Bob"
539395,Fisherman,2011-01-14 19:11:00,7201," Ha, and you didn't think I'd see that eh?    I'd love to see a Cabelas here too."
539399,misfish,2011-01-14 19:18:00,29133,"  We have that with ease. Guess you dont know BB. Barrie HAD great industry,but seem to have opted to be the top city of retail,,,,,,,,,,  Next to Napolian,were the next biggest,along with Flags unlimited. There UPS and Purolator,I dont count that as industry.   Ah, I see yer good eye is still work,n."
539403,dsn,2011-01-14 19:24:00,1018,Time to CASH In those HBC Rewards Points !! Or they'll be wasted..  DSN
539074,ColdH20guy,2011-01-14 00:01:00,312,"So I guess everyone has heard the news that Target has bought up Zellers in Canada for 1.8 billion or so but they wont be changing anything up for quite awhile. I have been to Target but cant remember what their sports/fishing dept is like..Zellers has pretty much dried up in that regard, People are wondering if the product will be the same as the US stores...time will tell I guess.. Target, WalMart, Home Depot, Lowes...alll we need now are Olive Garden Restaurant's back!!"
539075,irishfield,2011-01-14 00:04:00,26272,... and Frank Veters super steins and deep dish pizza!
539076,danbouck,2011-01-14 00:05:00,4380,"CNBC has a show on about target tonight, maybe I'll watch. I didn't know they bought zellers"
539078,Dondorfish,2011-01-14 00:10:00,1000,LOL - we had Frank Veters Pizza here in St. Catharines about 25 - 30 years ago  - didn't last to long and closed up  And isen't there a Olive Garden in Hamilton ( maybe closed up now to )    Tracker (Don)
539082,vinnimon,2011-01-14 00:13:00,2593, There was an olive garden at the university plaza in dundas. if its still there.
539085,irishfield,2011-01-14 00:16:00,26272,Yah... it would be about 30 years Don.. maybe 31. My class advisor use to take our entire 4th year class (was only 7 of us left!) there every Friday afternoon for Super Steins and pizza. His generosity went a long way to gain our respect and to attend his classes faithfully. I still have two of those fishbowls around here somewhere... my sister carried a BIG purse in those days. lol
539087,Old Man,2011-01-14 00:21:00,822,"There are still Olive Gardens out west in Manitoba, Alberta and BC. They are part of the Darden Franchise chain which also operate Eastside Mario's, Red Lobster and Longhorn Steakhouse to name just a few of their brands.  Hopefully Target can revive Zellers."
539094,GBW,2011-01-14 00:54:00,8460,"The Zeller's name of the 220+ stores is going to turn to Target on the 200 stores they want.  HBC is selling the prime stores to Target.  I hope they bring in the sports (fishing) section to take on Wally-world.  Oh and it's pronounced ""Tar-Jay"" for all you folks not in the know..."
539095,fishing n autograph,2011-01-14 00:56:00,2540,awesome...i love target!
539101,Gerritt,2011-01-14 01:09:00,6129,Best known for their womens fashions.... good luck fellas.  G
539137,Whopper,2011-01-14 02:27:00,2174,Most of us already have more tackle than Target carries
539175,Mattones,2011-01-14 03:26:00,587,My brother works for Zellers. Ima raz him over blackberry BBM now about it
539183,irishfield,2011-01-14 03:34:00,26272,I wouldn't raz him too hard.. as he may just be out of a job soon.
539187,SlowPoke,2011-01-14 04:01:00,2984,"This is a good thing, for consumers and employees. I left the company in November after 18 years; the writing had been on the wall for a while. It used to be a great place to work but in the last 5-6 years, its gone downhill. Budget cuts, downsizing, layoffs and outsourcing have left virtually every department handcuffed. There will be some management/transportation attrition but I'm betting there will be more jobs in the long run when everything shakes out. For consumers; better selection at low prices, better supply chain management, customer service/experience priorities. These guys know what they're doing. As for fishing; if they only stock red/white bobbers it will be an improvement over Zellers!"
539188,Cudz,2011-01-14 04:02:00,2652,Target's fishing dept in Buffalo was craptacular.  Hopefully that one store was not a representation of all others.
539216,misfish,2011-01-14 10:56:00,29133,"  Chris have faith.Cabelas is coming to Barrie,,,,,,"
539219,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 11:10:00,5865," Nope, all Target fishing depts are a waste of floor space.  Now if it's true about Cabela's coming to Barrie I may just have to apply for my Canadian citizenship..."
539223,spinnerbaitking,2011-01-14 11:20:00,1622," I traveled for work between 79 & 84 we ate at Mothers & Frank Veters quite a bit & I have 2 of them steins in my back room Book shelf, always hoped they would come back great tasting pizza at both Chains SBK"
539225,OhioFisherman,2011-01-14 11:30:00,6623,"Same deal here, if you are looking for fishing tackle Target isn`t the place to go. Although Kmart and Walmart here have a decent selection of lures for a beginner neither carries rods or reels I would be comfortable buying."
539226,misfish,2011-01-14 11:32:00,29133," I figured,if I keep wish,n,it may come true."
539247,I'mHooked,2011-01-14 13:13:00,525, If you're jigging for women it's a good thing!

539256,Fisherman,2011-01-14 13:33:00,7201,And where will your hard earned dollar go now..
539311,Cudz,2011-01-14 15:30:00,2652,"I hear you Brian.  How about turning the Old Barrie fairgrounds into a 2 store business.  Cabela's at one end and Ikea at the other.  One store for the wife and one store for me.  Great location.  Lots of parking.  I would even take a Gander Mountain there instead of Cabela's. I am not picky.  If that doesn't work, Park place has lots of land.  I think if we keep writing this it will happen.  Maybe??"
539330,bigbuck,2011-01-14 16:03:00,2449,"Not enough people in Barrie to justify a Cabela's. Down here in Oakville, we have plenty of space on the north side of Dundas....... As for Target, Zellers is losing business and has not had a steady focus in years. their stores look just like they did in the 80's and they just can't compete with Wal Mart, Wally world has too much buying power. I remember Frank Vetere's, there used to be one down on Bloor by the Museum, we went there in the early 80's for deep dish pizza and it was good! Now mind you, I was 10-11 years old at the time and not too fussy. I hope the Olive Garden doesn't come back, they sucked. There used to be one up by York U that I took one or two dates to back in the day and it wasn't great (I grew up with a bunch of Italians and I knew all about what Italian food really is)."
