538870,Spiel,2011-01-13 16:45:00,9065,  Exactly! Or you could view as I must be doing something wrong.
537834,limeyangler,2011-01-11 04:38:00,5204,"Hi all,  Went out for a couple of hours at 3pm. Was not expecting to catch anything....as i'd skunked for walleye the last 2 times i'bve been to this lake in the last 2 weeks. I was however under orders to get supper......pressure was on!  The pressure increased because i managed to get a decent eater (16"") on the ice almost immediately...then NADA for about half an hour until the BEAST hit, holy man was she a big girl....28"" long and probably the same around...belly on it was huge....MY NEW ICEFISHING WALLEYE PB!!!! well pleased with that. The reason the pressure had increased though is i could not bring myself to keep her...back she went and i still needed another fish(at least ) for supper purposes.  Well i got another about 16"" and supper was delicious tonight, great little session again...and got the walleye skunk off my back in style.  I always seem to do sooooo much better when i fish alone....weird...but true.   Here's some pretty crappy video and a couple of pics.  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlQC8QTy50?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlQC8QTy50?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlQC8QTy50?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>      "
