We are planning a trip to Shannonville on Friday and I am wondering about any reports for the Big Bay area ?  Most reports on the BOQ are for the reach.  With this cold this week I am wondering how the ice is building.  We are going out of Snookies to target perch but a few walleye would be nice as well.  Any information and tips would be appreciated.  be safe out there.  Regards"

537779,Stoty,2011-01-11 02:41:00,2910,"There's plenty of ice in Big Bay. We were on a solid 6"" of black ice. We (along with a bunch of others) all had bikes/sleds out there without issues.  The fishing......well, lol... it's been slower the past 4 days or so, but should pick-up soon! (hopefully!)  Be safe no matter how much ice is out there."

538063,cityfisher,2011-01-11 19:57:00,959," Big Bay yes, other areas are sketchy.  We also didn't do well over the weekend, spoke to a bunch of other guys and it was the same for everyone."
538879,legacey,2011-01-13 17:18:00,127,The bait shop is Pro Tackle...   http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/  Cheers
538895,Sinker,2011-01-13 17:59:00,8692,"I fished big bay yesterday. I put 3 on the ice between 12pm-dark. Lots of perch too. The little buggers stole my bait and we ran out of minnows. Get lots of bait,you`ll need it.  Plenty of ice. About 8inches where we were.  There are two bait shops north of the 401. One is quinte outdoor sports, on 62 North, the other is protackle on 37 north. Protackle is open 5am-5pm, quinte outdoors is no good if you want bait early, they open later, not sure what time.  S."
