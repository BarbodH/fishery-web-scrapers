97571,TennesseeGuy,2007-07-24 16:51:00,957,"..........by not lighting up the 73 candles on a birthday cake for me.  If I'd had a cake and if the cake had candles.  Due to my age and some medication I'm taking, my urologist gave me a year's supply of viagra last week.   I'm going to use half of them and see if Roy wants the other two pills.  Actually being 73 is much better than that."
