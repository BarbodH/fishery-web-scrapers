98714,tinbanger,2007-07-28 17:08:00,1028,no sleepimg in for me worked 5:30 till 9 am and thought why not a few hours fishing untill the storm (not) rolls thru. Don't fish KBAY much except in the winter so we spent a few hours moving around looking for fish. We did find quality but not much quantity. TB
