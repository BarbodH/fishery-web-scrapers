New boat is running  well and as you can see from the pictures there is no shortage of smiling faces or happy fishermen         Running my Lake Ontario boat with a ticket for the Toronto Sun Derby available to all clients. The Derby goes till the August 25th and the fish are just getting bigger.  If you want to get out there give me a call!    She handles great out on Erie.  http//:www.mountaincable.net/~fishmaster"
