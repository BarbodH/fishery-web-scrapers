Anyone know what its like or where to fish in the lake?  I believe its called Lake Mazinaw... I am hoping to catch some lakers but theyll be down really deep I guess.  Is there any way to fish lakers without downrigging?  How could I get a spoon down to like 40-50 feet by just casting?  Interested in the other species too, specially the walleye and bass and pike.  If anyone has any info please post back or PM me.  Thanks!  Mike"
