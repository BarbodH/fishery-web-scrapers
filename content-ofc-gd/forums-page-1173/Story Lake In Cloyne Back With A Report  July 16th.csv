98196,valerie,2007-07-26 17:38:00,83,"Man Its been a long time since i've been able to post i dont have the net at home so i use my works computer and they had this site blocked so now i can post my report of our trip to O.K here we go, left toronto 7:30 monday morning arrived in Northbrook just before 11:00 after we stopped for about an hour picking up some groceries we were off to the cottage . Got to the cottage by 12:00 and started to unpack. Me and my brother in law were on the lake by 4:00. The lake was small but just wright about 2.5km by 1 km maximun depth was about 12 ft that i could tell after about an hour my brother in-law hook onto his first fish after a decent fight he realed in his first ever pike which weighed about 2.5 lbs then he went on fire catching his second,third,and forth the biggest weighing 4.5lbs by this point i was very excited and jealous at the same time waiting for my first pike which wouldnt happen this day. He was using a green and orange chatter bait and i was using a #4 mepps spinner. Tuesday 5:30 in the morning we were back out the water was very calm with a light mist so i decided to try a large jointed perch jitterbug for some bass and then bang a big splash and tug and my bug was pulled under my heart was pounding and the only thing i could remember was to keep the line tight and keep realing and after a good fight it was my first pike i thought it was a bass for sure but i wasnt complaining it weighed in at 4.5 lbs then i switched back to the mepps and i landed 3 more from 2 to 4 lbs what a great feeling it sure got my heart going by thursday the weather started to change for the worse but that didnt deture us by the end of the week we both landed 8 pike each from 1.5 to my largest weighing 5 lbs and lost about a dozen more near the boat but we couldt land a bass they must have been hidding from all the pike my brother in law got a big one to the boat that must have been over 5lbs but when i tried to grab it with the net the mesh hooked onto the hook and popped it out of its mouth and like a flash it was out of the net and back into the lake and on friday i had a hard bite but it must have spit it out . But man i had a great week of fishing and had alot of fun with my wife and daughter and her familly but maybe you can tell me why do i only book a week at the cottage im still daydreaming about story lake . Well this is my report i hope you like it if i had the net at home i would have posted some pics have a great day everyone"

98263,Lostchild,2007-07-26 21:30:00,153,"Good to hear you had a great time and caught some fish!  I have never fished Story Lake but I have fished almost every other lake in the Land of Lakes area. It seems those smaller pike are everywhere and sometimes can become a nuisance, but something biting is better than nothing.  Oh ya where are the pictures! lol"
98277,Clampet,2007-07-26 22:30:00,1947,"Ah yes, the wily Essox Grassarius!  Sounds like you had a wonderful time, and made some memories to be retold time and again, especially a few years from now!  Story Lake had a good story after all! "

98505,valerie,2007-07-27 18:27:00,83,Snog or Snag is the pike master in the gta that gave me some very helpful advice . 8 pike landed and a handful lost at the boat was a great week of fishing for me. Last year 2 weeks up on haliburton lake all i caught were 2 nice sm and 2 small lake trout and a bunch of rockies with my wife and brothers.
98522,ccmtcanada,2007-07-27 18:52:00,7971,Good job man!  Sounded like a great time out there.  Snog/Snag has been having identity crisis after idendity crisis...we just smile and nod a lot.....LOL
