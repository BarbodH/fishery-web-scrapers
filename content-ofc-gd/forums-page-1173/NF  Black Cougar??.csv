98590,Deano,2007-07-27 22:13:00,767,"6 0'clock MCTV news just had another story, a big black cat was spotted in North Bay. Seems to be more and more sightings. Big black cat, bigger than a dog with a curved tale."
98602,Carpe Diem,2007-07-27 23:28:00,61,"There was something on a news broadcast in London (On.) a couple weeks back. A guy had submitted a camera phone video he shot of a supposed brown cougar, in his neighbor's driveway, across the street in town.  The news story only caught my attention because much to my surprise (and disbelief), i had seen what looked like a cougar, lying on the side of the road, on the 403, on my way from Hamilton to London. Thought at the time when i spotted it, nah, it couldn't be. There aren't any cougars in Ontario. Honest. Not telling a fish story.!!!!"
98637,ehg,2007-07-28 02:08:00,2666,"Always was skeptical about these eastern cougar/mountain lion sightings but not now. If Alberta has 8,000 cougars confirmed it seems possible there are a few hundred in Ontario.  There is lots of space outside of Toronto.   ehg"
98665,ch312,2007-07-28 08:27:00,1590,"the so called ""experts"" say the black ones are escaped pets eh. i guess they arent intelligent enough to figure out that theres something called melanism which causes fur/feathers to go all black instead of the normal color. although its rare, i dont see why people should automatically assume that the black cougars are pets that were released...."
98666,ch312,2007-07-28 08:30:00,1590, the MNR alway denies a population of cougars in ontario. i have no clue why they do this but it really doesnt make sense. there have been too many sightings to deny the fact that there is a population. nobody has any clue how many there are because these critters are so elusive and its likely extremely difficult to get an estimate of how many there are in ontario.
98699,singingdog,2007-07-28 16:38:00,1047,"There are no documented cases of a black cougar in North America....yes, colour variations occur in many animals, but not all colour variations occur in all animals. More than likely, the black ones being sited are escaped leopards or jaguars (both different species than a cougar). The wide range of the sightings could be the same animal: Jaguars in the wild can easily cover 80 miles/day when they are roaming."
98779,Northhunter,2007-07-28 23:41:00,214,"There was a similar sighting in the Gogama area (Westree) a couple weeks ago by my buddies dad. From a distance he first thought it was a bear, then saw the tail and other features. Camera was stashed away because of rain."
98781,Northhunter,2007-07-28 23:47:00,214," One theory is that if they acknowledge these things exists, then they would be forced to allocate money/resources to protect the population. Given the current state of the MNR and the issues it would effect (logging, hunting, etc.) it would be a big can of worms."
98789,niagara jeep,2007-07-29 00:37:00,20,Living in the Falls I have heard of something like a couger roaming the Fort Erie area.  Talked to guys who have even spooted what they though was a lynx in the Glen area.
98222,wallyboss,2007-07-26 19:07:00,1095,"I was fishing in Northern Ontario this week and one night coming back from Lake X (I don't name the lake just because I don't know the name) we saw something in the middle of the road that was black, solid black, being far from it we first tought it was a small bear, but getting closer to it we saw that it didn't walk like a bear does, all of a sudden the animal turned sideways and my buddy just jumped on the brakes, it had the round face of a cougar and the long tail of a cougar but it was all black. One leap and it had jumped over the creek on the side of the road. I lived in Northenr Ontario for 22 years and I have been hunting and fishing Northern Ontario for as long as I can remember and my fishing buddy is 77 years old and he spends his life in the bush. He gets rid of his 4wheeler every 3 years because of high mileage, He has never seen anything like this ever. But this was not finished about 2 miles further down the road we saw another one and this one was almost twice the size of the first one. The first one we saw we tought that it might've been a black wolf but as soon as it went sideways we saw that it was definetly not a wolf because of the round face. After seeing the second one I asked my buddy to pull over to get my camera out of the Argo just in case. the only other thing that we saw after that was a lynx that stood at least 3 feet high, it was a gorgeous animal , but it was a bit too quick for the camera. One thing about my camera is that I have to hold the button halfway down until a small light comes on then take the picture, wish I had one that was aim and shoot, cause by the time the light came on it was too late. It would've been a good picture because it had a hare in it's mouth.  Has anybody ever heard of a black cougar?? I have looked on the Net for pictures and the only thing that I can find that is exactly like the animal I saw was a panther , but I have never heard of any in Ontario,  The area was about 110 miles north of Timmins.  Around Fraserdale (Abitibi Canyon)"
98225,Deano,2007-07-26 19:17:00,767,"I saw something on the news the other night about a black panther (cougar). Someone reported seeing one, I think they figured it was a pet that someone let loose or something. I'll try to find the story, just caught part of it on the news and didn't get any details."
98226,rickster,2007-07-26 19:18:00,495,There has been a few reports over the past ten years or so of one being sighted in our area here in northwestern ontario
98227,bowshep,2007-07-26 19:20:00,378,l wonder if it can handle the winters and if it can we better get it a mate the winters are long. Peace Ken
98229,Bernie,2007-07-26 19:22:00,3190,There have been numerous reports recently around here of a large black cat. Panther supposedly. Didnt think they were a native animal of Canada.
98230,douG,2007-07-26 19:27:00,2693,"A panther is like a leopard, except it hasn't been peppered. Should you behold a panther crouch, prepare to say ouch.  Better yet, if called by a panther, Don't anther."

98233,mizzmo,2007-07-26 19:31:00,30,"I have seen a video (online) about two people that video taped a large black cat in there backyard in the winter. google it and you should find it.  i think it was spotted north of peterborough, if i'm not mistaken.  my dad was driving on a logging road near biscotasing last week and a brown cougar jumpedd out in front of his vehicle.  he thought it may have been a lynx but i don't think so by the size he said it was."

98243,ADC,2007-07-26 20:15:00,82,Maybe it was a Jaguar who decided to take a trip because he heard how great the fish were down here?  hahahaha  http://www.galleryone.com/images/frace/fra...ck%20jaguar.jpg
98249,Gerritt,2007-07-26 20:52:00,6129,  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!! that was friggen hilarious... Thanks!   Gerritt.
98250,2kj,2007-07-26 20:53:00,77,"Puma, cougar, panther and mountain lion are all one and the same, migrated from South America.  There have been black cougar sightings in the Niagra region as well as Northern Ontario for years.  Experts believe its a pet escaped, I think some mountain lions of traditional color give birth to the odd black one but just like Bigfoot nobody will believe they exist until someone shoots one and straps it to a pick up."
98254,wallyboss,2007-07-26 21:00:00,1095,I agree with Jbird about shooting one to believe but the cougars are on the Endangered list so If I ever shoot one you can be sure that somebody will find it on the side of the road and not tied to my pickup .
98288,Deano,2007-07-26 23:22:00,767,"I found out a bit of what I was talking about. It was in Powassan and ""Ingwersen said if the reports are accurate, the black panthers would most likely have been pets released into the wild."" Black Panther sightings"
98290,Tacklebuster,2007-07-26 23:38:00,303,I have heard of cougars in the Thunder Bay area.
98292,Greencoachdog,2007-07-26 23:43:00,8163,  ogden nash i believe...
98296,danc,2007-07-27 00:03:00,4677, There's lots of them at Scuttlebutts bar. All kidding aside I did see one some 30 years ago while Grouse hunting. Something I'll never forget.
98316,Daplumma,2007-07-27 01:22:00,1961,Wasn't sure where this post was gonna go when I read the title.I would have liked to have seen that cat. Joe
98318,danc,2007-07-27 01:29:00,4677,"Hey Joe??? You still in the OFC nascar pool? The way you've been dropping like a rock lately, I kinda figured that you folded for the year. Oh well. There's always next year."
98342,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-27 03:07:00,2585,yeah i saw the video a couple had of a panther in the lindsay area.  it was a few minutes long.  Cool stuff!  Cheers!
98365,snackpack5150,2007-07-27 10:14:00,79,"If it was a long bodied animal,it could actually have been a fisher. In most cases they are black from the shoulder down and have a long body. They are many found in the area where you were,I have a cottage near the Soo and have seen manyof them in the early morning.  Just a hunch  Ken"
98431,wallyboss,2007-07-27 14:12:00,1095,"Snack pack I've seen many fishers and this wasn't one. This was a definetly a cougar the only thing is that, it was black, that's what I found very strange."
98439,joonmoon,2007-07-27 14:39:00,528,"A full grown cougar will stand somewhere around 4' tall, Fishers are much smaller. The fact that its' black is just a genetics, look at wild wolf packs a lot of them are mixed colours and black is very common. These big cats are an awesome creature and should be photographed only. They are usually very shy but unpredictable. No need to shoot and strap it to the hood of yur pickup truck...unless they are eating yur chickens...lol."
98452,Wes Bender,2007-07-27 15:33:00,105,LOL @ Scuttlebutts cougars.  So true!
98459,Canoe2fish,2007-07-27 16:08:00,42,"As Nemo posted:  www.ontariopuma.ca  I don't know if Eastern Cougars can have the odd black offspring or not...wolves do, so why not.  Is it me or is there a lot of people who refuse to believe that Cougars could be on the comeback? Everytime I google the subject, it seems the MNR say they believe they are extinct or have inconclusive evidence...  Escaped pet? Yeah, like every city or town near a reported sighting could have that many escaped (and illegal) pets..."
