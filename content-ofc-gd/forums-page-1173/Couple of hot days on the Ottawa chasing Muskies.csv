Had a alot of fun even though it was ridiculously hot on the water. We managed to boat 3 fish and MuskyMatt came up with his buddy for Thursday aft for a fish as well and was nice to meet him.   First fish to kick of the morning on wed after about an hour of fishing.   The release   Then I caught the next couple both the same size, small but still fun to boat.   Matt coming out to join us with his buddy Dave.   Dave landed his first ever muskie.   His fish and his guide   Mike"

Last year Muskymatt invited me out with him and he taught me alot in a day.  We didnt get any but the next week I used what he taught me and got my first one.  Thanks again Matt."
