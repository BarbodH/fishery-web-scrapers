98633,fatherof3,2007-07-28 01:55:00,1769,Was just wondering if anyone else saw the story in the London free press that a possible metre long asian carp was caught off of Sarnia. They are attempting to confirm it. Not good.Not sure how to post links yet but just did a search for London Free Press and found it.
