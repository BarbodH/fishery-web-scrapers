98079,highdrifter,2007-07-26 05:59:00,2534,"Hello fellow OFNers (ettes)..  Took some time to get back on the ball..  An investment in some new tech toys has been a long time coming...  A new camera acquired from work, and a recent purchase in a brand spanking new IBM laptop should enable me to keep those urbain reports coming, to give something back, so to speak..  I've moved from uptown to an area close to the lake.  I live now right at the entrance of High Park, literaly foot steps aways from some prime new fishing haunts!!  The pike fishing may not be as good, but the largies have been treating me well.  I've even caught some decent smallies on a regular basis, something of a rarity in these parts of lake O.  Managed a couple hours out on the pond this Sunday.  Most were caught on plastics (I have since a new found faith in yamas), but a lot were also caught on cranks, anything with bright colors and a tight eratic wobble..  Here's some pics!    fishing from a tube sometimes calls for stretched muscles...       Some are prettier than others...   Just a smidgeon of things to come!!  tight loops  HD"

98108,seanb27,2007-07-26 12:58:00,11,WOW!  I must have spent close to ten hours on that pond this week and not even a bite. Just proves to me that i have alot to learn.  Sean.
98139,tbayboy,2007-07-26 14:47:00,1497,"Nice stuff HD, I bet having the tube really makes things easier.  Well all but the picture taking part"
98157,Golfisher,2007-07-26 15:30:00,586,Great pix!
98175,snag,2007-07-26 16:42:00,1932,How'd they taste?    Nice one dude
98199,ADC,2007-07-26 17:49:00,82,"  Nice,  I lived at the enterance of High Park since I was born 32 years ago. I dont live there any more but my dad does.  Great area!  Were those pics/fish from Grenadier Pond?"
98206,Snypa,2007-07-26 18:08:00,25,"Excellent report Fidel !!  Lots of fish to be had right now, the weather was soo nice yesterday, I might even go bassin again this afternoon (went yesterday mid-day & then also at dusk, caught about 6-8 fish) lots of fun.  One or two on a topwater skitter pop (brown frog), and the rest on this flo. yellow mini-spinnerbait that I use. I might have to post a few more pics tonight ! Keep'em coming"
98208,mepps,2007-07-26 18:22:00,1301,"Nice job!  You should meet up with Jon to fish, he lives right at Bloor and Dundas."
98259,highdrifter,2007-07-26 21:09:00,2534,  You getting warm!  I thought Grenadier was nothing more than a sess pool to clean the water before it joined Lake O...  I've seen the pond get pillaged for its panfish right at the peak of spawning season..  I usually give it a wide berth..
98260,highdrifter,2007-07-26 21:10:00,2534," Much obliged Clive!  I'll send him a PM.  regards,  Mcfinklestein"
98293,PatrickGG,2007-07-26 23:47:00,562,Nicely done Highdrifter i pass by the pond every day and i just mite make a quick stop and a few casts.
98344,007,2007-07-27 03:13:00,537,"Nice one Highdrifter!  I don't suppose you're gonna PM me with that GTA Smallie location that you referred to now are you???? Pweeesssse.  I think I asked you the same question last year, and you were tight lipped then!  Maybe one day we can hook up and catch some smallies in the GTA from Lake Ontario- that would sure be cool!  Tightlines. 007"
98356,highdrifter,2007-07-27 04:17:00,2534," hahah.  I've been sworn to secrecy..  If you've got a tube or kayak, I will lead you, blind folded of course, to a little spot I call heaven..  cheers  HD"
98370,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-27 11:26:00,0,Great report. Those are some pretty decent local bass. You guys put in alot of footwork and it seems to pay off.
98377,Douger,2007-07-27 11:42:00,116,"nice work.  i just moved near high park this past winter.  i haven't  fished around here, since i only really have time for the fall & spring steelhead runs.  good work on putting in the time to figure out where those fish are!"
98381,ccmtcanada,2007-07-27 12:04:00,7971,Wow...great report and those urban hot spots need to be protected!!!  Some great pictures out there...it's hard to believe the areas that hold fish in Toronto....thanks for the report!
98384,Guest mistyriver1,2007-07-27 12:07:00,0,"Congrats Highdrifter, nice report."
98421,fishboy,2007-07-27 13:49:00,550,those are some great fish for an urban setting-how more urban can you get than TO?
98467,ehg,2007-07-27 16:40:00,2666,"Good to see the T.O harbourfront reports again! Nice bunch of largemouth. I've mostly caught smallies in the rivers, must be some bruisers in the big lake areas.  Thanks for posting,  ehg"
