98512,Guest mistyriver1,2007-07-27 18:38:00,0,That's a shame
98518,valerie,2007-07-27 18:48:00,83,From 200 to 1000's of dead fish they were off by a bit . But the drinking water is ok
98519,ccmtcanada,2007-07-27 18:50:00,7971,Oh man...that's terrible!!!
98521,Roy,2007-07-27 18:52:00,13728,"Thousands of fish die from run off of rat poison but it doesn't affect the drinking water....yeah, I believe that...."
98526,Dutch,2007-07-27 19:05:00,831,"All drinking water is treated and goes through rigorus screening and filtering for various types of contaminants.  The drinking water that is untreated (wells, natural springs) usually comes from underground aquafirs that are not impacted by surface run-off.  Now anyone drinking directly from that stream - that is a different story."
98529,LesCulpJr,2007-07-27 19:12:00,75,"Oh boy, what a mess!"
98538,Squid,2007-07-27 19:37:00,1656,"""We can't say for sure what caused their death. We'll have to wait for the results."""

98557,fishboy,2007-07-27 20:38:00,550,It is a shame because Spencer is a reasonably healthy creek for an urban setting.
