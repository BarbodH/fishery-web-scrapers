It's actually cutting our feet when we walk barefoot in the house....  Thanks for the help guys,  Dave"

It is actually a giant pain in the azz and not worth the trouble of having it. A cut loop will last longer (berbers unravel badly if the dog catches a loop in his nail ...unraveled loops should be trimmed with scizzors immediately).  One of the trouble with a berber is that they will hold stains and dirt very heavily. You are probably walking on some type of spill that has matted the fibres. If a good steam cleaning and vaccuming doesn't soften up the fibres, toss it and get new stuff. 100% wool berbers are actually not bad, but very rare. The newer no-stain nylon carpets (cut pile) are far more durable and long lasting. Just make sure it is all nylon and not a mix nylon/olefin. The more money you spend on padding, the longer your carpet will last."
