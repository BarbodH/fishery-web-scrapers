98457,supernaut,2007-07-27 16:04:00,46,I'm looking to buy a trolling motor for my 14' aluminum. I have a 9.5Hp now..What pound thrust would I need and accessories? Any deals out there? Mostly for Bass and Pickeral..
98462,Roy,2007-07-27 16:22:00,13728,Do you want a bowmount or a tiller?
98463,supernaut,2007-07-27 16:24:00,46,Tiller most likely!
98552,boatman,2007-07-27 20:16:00,350,"I've used both a 30 and a 36 lbs motor on my heavy 14' tin boat (needs minimum 20 hp just to plane two +200lbs guys). I found the 30lbs a little underpowered, whereas the 36 lbs is just right. You could get away with the 30 lbs, but I suspect the 36 lbs would be better."
98558,fishboy,2007-07-27 20:41:00,550,  ..and I'd suspect you'd get more efficient battery use out of the more powerful one since it won't struggle as much to push the boat.
98559,Mike the Pike,2007-07-27 20:46:00,3421,Go with 46lbs of thrust or more it pushes my 18 foot aluminium bare bones.Make sure you purchase a model with a maximiser.The battery will last much longer with this feature.  MTP
98565,setomonkey,2007-07-27 20:54:00,872,"I agree with MTP, go with higher thrust, for windy conditions. I bought a 50 lb transom mount for the cottage boat (14' tinny) and it works great, even with a lot of wind and waves.  Mike"
98591,boatman,2007-07-27 22:23:00,350,"How about slow trolling with the high thrust models? How slow can they go? My 36lbs on the slowest setting is slow enough for most situations, but I wonder if it might be too fast for dead trolling a worm on bottom. Its certainly strong enough for windy days."
98599,Cookslav,2007-07-27 23:14:00,1457,"I'd say the higher thrust the better. MORE POWER!!! LOL... You can always use the lower gears, and back troll if your speed is still to fast But if you have a high thrust motor you have the option of kicking it up in high wind, or thick weed. Just don't forget..the higher the thrust, the more power consumption you will burn.  Ps. I a lttile birdie told me BPS has a variety of trolling motors on some 50% off for a limited time...."
