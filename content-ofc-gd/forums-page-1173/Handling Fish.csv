I fish mainly for bass, but often catch pike and muskie in the same lake and was wondering the correct way to get them out of the water... or the easiest. thanks"

(if you don't have a net) it's best to lift them up using two hands, one under the head and the other one under the tail part ... do not hold them vertically ... and try to keep them out of the water as little time as possible... o also, watch out for those sharp teeth!"
