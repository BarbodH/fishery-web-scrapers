Thinking of going there for bassin' this weekend, but if I get bounced around by big boats crusing down the river, I might as well go straight to Rice Lake.  Cheers,"
98454,Rich,2007-07-27 15:53:00,3927,I'd just head to Rice. It's prime yacht season on that stretch.
98464,Zamboni,2007-07-27 16:30:00,235,"Yep, next few weeks are busy-plus good weather will add to traffic. Guy I know with a cruiser is thinking by next year the current gas prices will seem like a bargain so getting in as much boating as possible."
98468,ehg,2007-07-27 16:45:00,2666,"Here is a picture from last long weekend near Bensfort bridge.  If you stay near the shore no problem, the middle of the river could be busy in the afternoon.  ehg"

98480,Golfisher,2007-07-27 17:34:00,586,Thanks guys for the heads-up; I guess I should rethink my plan.
