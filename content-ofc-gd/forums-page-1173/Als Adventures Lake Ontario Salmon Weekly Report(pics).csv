The week started off great with Derek and me managing to get out for few hours early in the mornings. We set our lines and starting trolling in pursue of the Great Ontario Salmon Derby winner. The water has warmed up tremendously here on the North Shore so the fishing has seemed to turn on big time.  Here are a couple of pictures of Derek with some big Chinook salmon   Derek with a nice 23lb salmon   Derek with a 25lb+ salmon (congratulations bud)   I was very lucky to be able to spend two quality afternoons with my father. Dad always seems to luck out with great timing for his fishing trips. The weather was perfect and the fishing was even better. Our first evening out we ended up 5-8 with some nice fish around twenty pounds.  Here are some pictures of Dad Dad warming up “FISH ON”   Nice high teenager     Dad has been to BC for salmon fishing twice and says the fishing is much better in Lake Ontario. We boated him two fish in less than one hour, that were bigger than he caught in an entire week up on the BC coastline.  Here are a couple more pictures of Dad with his Salmon    Every fish we boated this week was put back for another day “release shot”   Come on out and try your luck at catching some of the best salmon fishing in Canada, right here in Lake Ontario Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
