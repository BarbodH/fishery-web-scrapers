433456,maybo,2010-02-15 16:40:00,86,"what ever that boy was eating, it must be very good!"
433458,TJQ,2010-02-15 16:41:00,7806,LOL....   yup he was hungry and not spooked by our camera!!
433460,tibbs,2010-02-15 17:13:00,650,"He should go on the show ""Dragons Den"" to pitch his idea."
433481,aplumma,2010-02-15 18:29:00,6896,""" We have 100 Canadians and 200 Americans drowned each year"". I bet a lock on the cooler would cut those numbers in half.  He might consider getting a few to the guides of the lodges and letting them road test it for a season. Our hero Dave might be able to evaluate it also.....    Art"
433800,aplumma,2010-02-16 12:46:00,6896,bump just in case the answer to his prayers is on line this mornin.   Art
433808,mbac31,2010-02-16 12:57:00,904,Great product TJ. I was talking to him myself. Funny guy as well.
433837,Stoty,2010-02-16 14:14:00,2910," Good idea, but it's just too bad that there is like a 5 yr wait to get on that show."
433918,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-16 18:11:00,4399,"I really can`t see this contraption going anywhere, if the support piece is on the inside the boat I think it would block access to the rod lockers on the side. I don`t know about you guys but I sure don`t need another trip hazard in my boat plus you have store it."
433920,TJQ,2010-02-16 18:27:00,7806,What I thought was cool about it is it could be used to hold the net ouitside the boat.. make unhooking fish much easier when with no one else and or kids...
433935,Paully,2010-02-16 19:06:00,712,"  It would be more fitting if he went to the other show .. ""shark tank"" "
433938,bare foot wader,2010-02-16 19:11:00,1354,"definitely a unique and creative idea, props to that....but I really see no functionality for it on the water, looks clumsy with the foot operation..if he lost the foot lever part and just had the the net holder to clamp the net to the gunnel when you  work on a fish in the net - that would be useful to me....if the net is stored in the water I'd think it would just collect debris  as for keeping things safe, PFD's can fix that problem"

434047,Fisherman,2010-02-17 00:17:00,7201,"Well I don't think that would be much good on anything under an 18 foot boat, takes up a pile of room, might make the boat tilt a bit, you would always have to get the fish to the same side of the boat, have to take it down to put the boat cover on...hmmm..add a garbage can and lid, oh wait, they already have foot operated garbage cans."
434049,Muskieman,2010-02-17 00:19:00,2472,"Is he a member?  I like the Idea   ... Seeing that I fish alone 90% of the time ... Seems that it would be an extra hand or ""Foot"" in the boat. Sometimes fighting and netting a large fish by yourself can be a problem... might help one of US to not be one of those 100 Canadians or 200 Americans.  RFS "
434538,icedude,2010-02-18 19:35:00,459,"  I wish the guy luck  Bump!  it is not 5 years to pitch to the Dragons Den CBC folks on air  if they like what you have for reality TV entertainment puposes, they fast track you-of this i know  ID1  www.TheZingy.com  sorry Mods--just a shameless plug--lol  Thanks"
