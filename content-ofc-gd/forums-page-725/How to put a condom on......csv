434697,mossyoak_ontario,2010-02-19 04:47:00,12,"now that i got your attention,  a friends joke led me to some thinkin and i learned a new way to tie realistic feeling and looking grub bodies and bubble gum worms from using colored latex condoms.  yes, it works real well and looks amazing finished, Ive spent the last few days cutting slippery, lubed comdoms into strips, and whippin up some wicked looking flies,  cant wait to try these guys  out.   Of course i wasnt the first person to think of using condoms as a skin wrap on a fly, but it took a dirty joke for me to realize its potential..  check out this link, just thought id share.  http://www.condomdepot.com/learn/detail.cfm/cid/243"
434703,GoneFishin,2010-02-19 05:16:00,349," First time I heard of it I thought it was a joke lol. But it actually worked quite well for tying scud flies. The bubble worm sounds like a good idea, I might try tying up a couple. I wonder if fish like tropical flavoring??"

434729,skeeter,2010-02-19 12:41:00,1907,"hey honey, im going fishing this weekend. can you stop by the drug store and pick me up a box of condoms ?          try and explain that to your wifes lawyer !!!!!!!  "
434733,skeeter,2010-02-19 12:47:00,1907,hey--- if you take a used condom and cut stips on the end of it it would look like a squid  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but please dont tell us who gets to put the tube jig hook into it.........      LOL---just figured i would get my 3 cents worth in before everyone else...LOL
434796,JohnF,2010-02-19 17:31:00,3494," Okay. The day anybody I'm fishing with offers to share their used condoms with me, I'm outa the boat.  JF"

434811,Great Lake Steel,2010-02-19 17:57:00,41, That's why they're pre-lubricated.
434830,MJL,2010-02-19 19:04:00,2427,Nifty idea.  Sure beats paying paying fly shop prices for shell-back and scud materials  Condoms aren't only useful for fly tying...They also make a great alternative for the steelheaders with weak clickers on their centrepins  http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/hairband.asp
