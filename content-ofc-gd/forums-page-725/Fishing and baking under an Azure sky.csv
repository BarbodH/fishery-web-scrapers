I had already hooked up the boat and loaded Buck into the truck when my neighbour strolled over with his fishing rods... ""Good Timing""  he observed.  ""Excellent timing!"" I agreed.  The back half of our reservoir has been closed for the last three months, as a bird sanctuary. We were anxious to give this area a try now that it has reopened.  A local guy I know from Yuma Bass Masters, told me that dark red is a hot colour in the spring because it resembles the local Crayfish.  I have been doing well on my Spro Little John,  Last week I added a semi-transparent Red one to my collection. I caught a fish on it my last time out, so I started with it again this morning.  The water temperature was 60 degrees and the air was 65 at ten o'clock.  Around eleven, it was up to 70 degrees, and there was a solid bump on the line. We were in a canal about fifty feet wide with palm, bamboo, cattails and reeds along both edges. The boat was near the middle so that we could each work a bank. The sky was cloudless and the sun was very bright...the water had a heavy stain, but it wasn't deep. We suspected the bass would be under the heavy overhanging.  I though this guy would weigh more, but the scale said he was only three pounds.  He must have liked that red bait, because it was completely inside his mouth!  At lunch time it was 75...We had switched baits, and I caught one more little one on the Chartreuse Little John.   As two o'clock approached the sun was beating down and the slight breeze we had in the morning was gone.  It was now 77 degrees and still rising. We were starting to feel a little roasted, so we called it a day. Garry2R's-- Fishing is my favorite form of loafing."
