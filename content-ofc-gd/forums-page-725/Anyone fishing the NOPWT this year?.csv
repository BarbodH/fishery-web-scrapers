433662,TDunn,2010-02-16 00:52:00,680,"Yup, pretty sure I'll be at Dubreuville this year. Thinking about Mattagami or Timmins also   TDunn"
433665,archie_james_c,2010-02-16 01:00:00,618," Very cool maybe I'll see you there.  How is the tourney itself? Do you share pretty tight quarters with other boats? How are the attitudes of the anglers in general? Lots of courtious, professional people or more of the 'WEEEEEEEEEEEEW LETS DRINK SOME BUDS AND CATCH SOME WALLEYES!!!!"" kinda crew?"
433674,TDunn,2010-02-16 01:25:00,680,Ive yet to fish a tourny in the NOPWT. My understanding is that it is a serious tournament series. Contact one of the people on the board of directors. I contacted Jamie Robinson and asked him a few questions. He replied quickly with some good info.  TDunn
434671,archie_james_c,2010-02-19 03:34:00,618,Thats what I understand too...but so was the Sault Salmon Derby and I still remember all the dickheads out on the river on those days  Anyone else fishin it?
434786,anders,2010-02-19 16:33:00,1168,"I have fished it for a few years now...and was supposed to go to Geraldton last year but couldnt but my partner went, and said it was run great as well....however...be sure to register early for more of those northern tourneys as they fill up fast.  This is a serious derby and the attitiude is great, with lots of enforcement from the OPP and the MNR.  It is a great derby, run with a great goup of people from  the big city of Dubreuilville.  The fishing can be tough...best to pre fish the crap out of the resevoir so you know where they are...lots of big fish to be had.  Pre-fishing this derby helps alot...there is a reason why the top walleye anglers do well there year after year.  When you do fish it...look for the crowds...seriously!!"
