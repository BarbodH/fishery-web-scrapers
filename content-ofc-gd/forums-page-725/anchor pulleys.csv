434607,tomO,2010-02-19 00:45:00,363,Thinking about putting an anchor pulley on the boat. I've read some bad reviews on the electric ones . Just curious.
434609,HTHM,2010-02-19 00:50:00,4082,I have a trailer winch that I use on my boat. I find that it works quite well. I put it into freewheel to deploy the anchor and crank it up when it is time to move.
434616,tomO,2010-02-19 01:07:00,363,Does the winch hang over the boat so the anchor doesnt hit the bow?

434637,tomO,2010-02-19 02:29:00,363,Thats why I was thinkin about a pulley up front I can sit in the back and let go. I not gettin any younger and the anchor seems to be heavier than it used too.
