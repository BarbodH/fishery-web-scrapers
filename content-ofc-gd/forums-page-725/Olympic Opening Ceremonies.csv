432899,Andy,2010-02-13 15:10:00,330,"Except for the one pillar not going up, I enjoyed the technical stuff. I don't know what the circumstances were (who was late and why) but  the empty seats in the executive area when the GG was introduced was completely unacceptable, there was no excuse for it, people taking coats off, racing around, setting up chairs.  I give credit to the young woman singing the anthem, awesome voice, it just should have been something we could all sing. I was thoroughly disgusted when the kinda different version of the anthem was being sang. There were people in the executive box still missing, and others still talking and moving about,(the woman behind the Prime Minister in the red sweatshirt and dreads should be deeply ashamed for being an embarassment to the nation) and hardly anyone standing at attention. I'm still pissed. The troups in Afghanistan showed how it's done, all at attention during the entire song. I couldn't figure out why the flags weren't waving more than they were, they didn't look right either. Overall, I thought it was good, it just looked like someone tried a little too hard at times, and tried to accomodate too many sensitive people, without getting the small stuff right. But what do I know. Andy"
432900,canadadude,2010-02-13 15:27:00,769,"I thought the opening ceremonies were a solid A-. The National Anthem was butchered to death, it is our national anthem not some R&B soul song, I wish singers would have alittle more respect and play the song in a traditional manner, it was unrecognizable in parts and to me an embarisment. The performers sang great, not sure exactly what K.D Lang's deal is but she does have an awsome voice and performed well. The olympic hym was alittle much, but all in all a good show."
432903,Cookslav,2010-02-13 15:32:00,1457,"Personally these kind of shows are not my bag...I gues I'm not ""cultured"" enough to enjoy the Interprative dance LOL But as far as comparisions go vs. other shows in the past? Truth be told i think it rocked....  Sorry but I didn't get the Beijing show either, and certainly don't think it was any better? The Light show alone was enough for me to think it was awesome.  Was the dance, or song part better or worse then the others? No I don't think so.  But that light show was killer."
432907,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-13 15:44:00,10439,"  Sad to say that if you live in Ontario  that is the case, but out West and in the North it is a totally different scenario."
432908,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-13 15:46:00,3761,Amazing to say the least. The construction of it the amount of organization and well wow. Feels good to be Canadian knowing what these fine people have created.  Go Canada!
432915,Governator,2010-02-13 16:01:00,879,"It was well done, but I thought there was way too much emphasis on the Natives.  People around the world are simply going to have the wrong impression.  Not to mention their legs must've been dead tired after an hour of non stop dancing while the athletes came in.  The show itself was great, although it simply wasn't as good as what the Chinese did in my opinion.  Not to mention a 25% failure at the end didn't help, Steve Nash was looking around like what the hell is going on?  I thought the girl who did the commercial for the olympics who sang the national anthem is an absolute gem of a singer but I absolutely hated the version she sang.  It lacked the power that our song has with it's normal tempo.  I also wish Celin Dion sang... let's be honest, she represents.  Regardless of the technical flaws, Go Canada Go - Win it on home soil!"
432916,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-13 16:02:00,10439,"  The style in which the Anthem was sung was dictated by the producers not theperformer. They had her on this morning and the commentator commented about the R&B twist and she said she performed it the way she was asked and said she is just a performer doing what the director and producer wanted for the show. I agree that I would have rather heard a more traditional version but her version wasn't bad, just different. She does have a heck of a voice. I also agree about the operatic singing of the olympic hym. Not a fan of opera at all."
432919,Twocoda,2010-02-13 16:13:00,4130,Actually i liked the spin that little girl put on our national anthem...i thought it was refreshing although while it was happening i found it uncomfortable ....but after it was absorbed into my brain ....i loved it  Shame about the glitches ...Must have been a microsoft program to lift 4 BC Bud joints  Aboriginal aspect was a bit too long ....but very much appreciated for the representation  special effects was simply amazing and entertaining .....  Sad for the dark shadow of the Georgian team...hopefully something GREAT comes from their tragedy
432930,JohnF,2010-02-13 16:45:00,3494,"My thoughts:  1. I was embarrassed by the rockification of the national anthem. Not only was it a poor setting for it, she even had to come up with one of the worst abominations ever committed. It gets treated with more respect at HNIC games broadcast from American arenas.  2. The show for the most part did a decent job of showing our cultural diversity. The fact that Canada also has a bunch of just plain old folks who say thanks and sorry too much was kind of lost in the shuffle. BTW, the poet's piece was spot on, wasn't it? After I pondered on the areas of our diverse culture that were emphasized it occurred to me that us boring uncultured types (the majority of Canucks) would be admirably represented by our team of athletes. I was impressed that our team was exceeded in number by the Americans alone and then by only a handful. That's quite an accomplishment given our relative populations.  3. The snowboarder at the opening was great.  4. I kinda liked KD singing Cohen, a three Canadian birds with one stone thing.  5. The finale was pretty weak. Not bad up till the mechanical failure, but then it bogged down instead of building in intensity , and having to follow Wayne riding in the rain to do a lackluster outdoor lighting didn't exactly revitalize it. Lousy choreography at best. The flame lighting needs to be explosive and dramatic, not pedestrian and routine. Perhaps that was some choreographer's commentary on our Canadian persona.  6. I thought Furtado looked funny in the fancy duds.  7. The show effects weren't bad. I liked the killer whales. The Peter Pan thing was a tad obscure. The piratical fiddlers were a bunch over the top. I'd have preferred Natalie McMaster to MacIsaac if they wanted to get in the maritime celtic thang.  I'm not a big fan of these productions so I won't even try to grade it. Now I'm looking forward to watching the events coverage and hopefully seeing some Canadian golds medals.  JF"
432931,canadadude,2010-02-13 16:51:00,769,"I apologise to the very tallented singer she does have great voice, so my disgust goes out to the producers. Get it together, perform our National anthem in a traditional respectfull manner, your not producing a new song to make the Bill-board charts have some National pride and respect for the anthem."
432932,TerryC,2010-02-13 16:59:00,196,"KD LANG ??????   I thought it was Mario Lemieux trying to one up Gretzky!   I actually really enjoyed the show. Sometimes you gotta look at this stuff through kids eyes. I recorded it last night and played it for my Twin 5 year olds today, and they were amazed by it.  Clarence"
432937,rob v,2010-02-13 17:15:00,535,   Now that is funny !!
432939,douG,2010-02-13 17:40:00,2693,I was proud.
432954,anders,2010-02-13 19:33:00,1168,"Overall i thought it was great...the national anthem however, was awful, emabarressed at that, however there rest of the show was cool!  Proud to be Canadian thats for sure!"
433092,hammercarp,2010-02-14 02:33:00,964,I really enjoyed most of it. Nellie Furtado looked great. I could do without seeing another Peter Pan act. KD Lang did a great job on one of Cohens songs. As for the disfunctional pillar...well does anyone see a Viagra skit coming outa that. The visual effects were awesome.
433151,fish_fishburn,2010-02-14 11:34:00,1311,"In general I thought it was good. I didn't like the rendition of our national anthem, The whales was really cool. And all the salmon swimming around. Thought for sure they would of shown a fisherperson trying to catch one. All the first nation stuff was nice but a bit much. They should of thrown a moose in there somewhere along with a few beaver shots, but all in all a good job. I'm proud to be CANADIAN. Go Canada go."
433166,capt_hooked,2010-02-14 13:11:00,212,"I think they should have hired the people who produced the commercials for Newfoundland and Labrador..!  They are first rate.  Overall, I found the show boring...  The most memorable moment was when the kids from Georgia marched in...!"
433173,John Bacon,2010-02-14 14:07:00,3277," That would make for an interesting show; but I think they needed to keep it ""G"" rated."
433175,bigugli,2010-02-14 14:22:00,6138,"  Have to bow to pop trends sometimes, not.  Truth be, pirates and privateers were a way of life in Nova Scotia for 100 years. The early wealth and history of Liverpool is steeped in it."

A true Canadian symbol .....albeit minus the beaver."
433302,danbouck,2010-02-14 22:23:00,4380,They should have had Rush do the national anthem
433417,fish_fishburn,2010-02-15 13:51:00,1311,Canoeing north. KD did an awesome job. I havent seen her for years but man she still has an incredible voice.
434442,canoeing north,2010-02-18 05:47:00,12,"I actually haven't seen or heard about her for over a decade . Her performance was awesome , even for a guy like me who grew up listening to Aerosmith and Zepplin ."

It was absolutely world class and the lighting and visual effects were among the best in the world, absolutely stunning. The performances were flawless and have shown the world what being Canadian is all about.  Here's to the next 16 days.  GO CANADA!!!!!!!!   "
432851,xeon,2010-02-13 05:20:00,350,I thought it sucked.
432853,rob v,2010-02-13 05:23:00,535,I thought they were great also.   The Olympic song was a bit much - but what they hey - gotta have olympic tradition also.   Great production.
432855,danc,2010-02-13 05:30:00,4677,I agree drifter. Awesome show. We should be proud.
432856,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-13 05:30:00,0,the glitz and glamour should have been at the beginning but it was interesting!
432857,maybo,2010-02-13 05:32:00,86,"i think it's good, but the Beijing one was better"
432859,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-13 05:43:00,0, that's what happens when you have a communist country at your disposal.  lol!
432860,Cookslav,2010-02-13 05:56:00,1457,"I Guess it was good LOL...  I'm not one for interpretive dance, tap dancing, puppet shows, flying peter pan wanna be's or lip syncing performers BUT... The light show, especially the killer whale part was pretty dam Kewl."
432861,Cudz,2010-02-13 06:03:00,2652,I thought it was weak. THere were some good things but way too artsy for me.  Are you telling me we can't do better than KD Lang???  I don't even know who that duet was. Could we have anymore bearded guys in the show? Native chiefs late for the ceremony was funny. Whale on ground was good. Snowboarder jump was good.  Hydraulic pillar not funtioning was not acceptable in my opinion.  A bit Mickey Mouse in my opinion
432865,Dozer,2010-02-13 06:39:00,896,"The coloured goatee's of some of those violinists (sp?) and tap dancers was a bit dirty, they kinda reminded me of the skids I see downtown."
432866,Jigger,2010-02-13 07:11:00,1237,"The national anthem had my wife and I both shaking our heads. If you want to make your own version of O Canada, do it at the Grey Cup, not when the whole country is trying to have a singalong. Other than that, I felt real proud tonight. Sure some of the show were a little campy. But I'm real happy that they granted the 4 Nations Head of State status. Nice tribute to the Luger that died as well. Hope they bring home alot of Gold this year!"
432868,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-13 11:21:00,1362,"My wife and I thought the ceremonies were alright.....they started off slow and one thing we both commented on was the fact that the introduction announcement for the ceremonies started in French, was then translated in English and this continued thoughout the entire show   ......We could understand if the games were being held in Quebec, but c'mon, Vancouver???????????????????????!!!!"
432870,Woodsman,2010-02-13 12:34:00,1286,We have a different approach. When China thought a young girl was too ugly to perform they recorded her & put a better looking girl on stage to lip sync the song. We let K.D. Lang perform.
432871,Cudz,2010-02-13 12:40:00,2652,"Yeah, but KD lang is a dude. Guys (especially musicians) don't have to be good looking to be successful.  Steven Tyler, Mick Jager for example."
432873,Terry,2010-02-13 12:54:00,14456,she only thinks she's a dude
432879,bullybass,2010-02-13 13:23:00,144,  The cost for the opening ceremony in Beijing was more than $300 Million The cost in Canada was @ $38 million.  Was Beijing's 10 times better?
432881,bushart,2010-02-13 13:33:00,2628,Maybe I lean to the artsy side but I thought it was world class  good mix of heritage---landscape--celebs  Technical stuff was 110%  But that's just me  Bushart
432883,yakpiker,2010-02-13 13:38:00,160,"In addition to being a disappointed viewer, I felt disconnected from and embarrassed by how we were presenting ourselves to the rest of the world.  Hopefully, the lasting memories from these Olympics will be something other than the luge tragedy and the opening ceremonies."
432885,Cudz,2010-02-13 13:44:00,2652,"Exactly.  Aparently we are a bunch of beard-wearing, poorly dressed, dyed haired, tattooed, tap dancing, trannies.  Well actually it might have been a good representation but we should try our best to not let the rest of the world know this.  Beijing spent $300 million and  we spent $38 million.  You could tell. At $38 million, we got ripped off.  I figure that was worth $8 million.  Someone just stole $30 million and is going to get away with it."
432887,grt1,2010-02-13 14:02:00,638,"I agree that it was well done, but having said that, I agree that we all aren't a group of fiddlers, tap dancers or acrobatic flyers.  I have put the question to the americans on another board to see what their opinion was of the ceremonies since they would be getting the American ""spin"" from NBC.  The only screw up was the hydrolic issue they had at the end and that sure shouldn't have happened."
432889,Musky or Specks,2010-02-13 14:14:00,2710,My problem with the show was if you were say from Italy you would think we revere native canadians their culture and way of life and thats just not the case. I found the whole native spin incredibly hypocritical.
432890,BITEME,2010-02-13 14:17:00,1968,I thought it was really good ..The whales.... that was spectacular As far as the mechanical glitch at least whoever programmed that ascent didnt have it locked so the torches would'nt light if only 3 legs were up. and in my opinion David Suzuki should have lit the torch.  Im proud to be CANADIAN
432891,John,2010-02-13 14:18:00,2956,"It was an amazing production that did this wonderful country proud. A great representation of who we are, our history, culture and natural beauty. Comparing it to Beijing is not what we should be doing.  It was CANADA'S world class production that did us proud."
432894,bullybass,2010-02-13 14:46:00,144,I agree that the show was fantastic. It has to be very difficult to represent everything Canadian as we are a melting pot. My kids thought the whales were real!!!! I thought it was world class!!!!
432896,rob v,2010-02-13 14:58:00,535,"I think we showed the world that Canada is a nation with a history, a heritage, a geography and culture that is like no other - one that includes aboriginal peoples and a broad range of personalities.  And yes, using both of our country's official languages was a bit trying at times but I think it also helped to illustrate who we are, and that we embrace it.  It was a productin for all Canadians.  And yes the performances were lip synched - but they were the voices & performances of some of Canada's most recognized performers.  Too bad they couldn't have used more.   the mechanical problem at the end -  well crap happens."
