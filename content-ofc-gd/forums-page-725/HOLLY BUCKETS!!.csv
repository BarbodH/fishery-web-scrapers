434666,smitter,2010-02-19 03:30:00,106,At least they kept it interesting.
434673,Paully,2010-02-19 03:36:00,712,Gota give it to Jonas Hiller .. he played a good game.
434681,fish_fishburn,2010-02-19 04:08:00,1311,"good thing Brodeur was between the pipes, cause we sure needed him tonight."
434712,Stoty,2010-02-19 10:13:00,2910,"It's great that they won, but that cost us a valuable point! (We got 2 pts instead of 3) We won't get the #1 seed now, which will be a big loss."
434722,dave524,2010-02-19 12:16:00,4508," Just got up and see the Russians went down to Slovakia in a shootout, getting very interesting.."
434939,Stoty,2010-02-20 04:19:00,2910," WOW, I didn't know that! That's a huge bonus!"
434965,dave524,2010-02-20 11:47:00,4508,"Yes, Canada beats the US and Russia takes the Czechs, we have #1 seed.  Unless I'm missing something"
434972,trevy727,2010-02-20 12:40:00,351,who cares about #1 seed. top 4 teams get a bye to the quarter finals
434977,Daplumma,2010-02-20 13:16:00,1961,Tomorrow afternoon will be interesting. Joe
