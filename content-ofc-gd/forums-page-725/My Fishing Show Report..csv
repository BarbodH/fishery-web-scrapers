Pete and Corvette1      Esther Maina      Steve and the Maina's www.petemaina.com      HTHM, Phill Harrison, and Maureen at their booth.  www.offthedock.net      Uncle Buck and his girl      Our Newest Client, Steve from Chaudiere Lodge      Greg and Gavin from DT Powersports (thanks for the tickets!!)    This is one booth that really got my attention, just because it was set up well, and looked really pretty, I don't fly fish, but wow.. if i did...  looks like they have a nice website as well..  reelflies.ca     I thought this product was a great concept for cutting line,  I was gonna come back and get a couple but of course forgot..   I think the guy said it was patented and made here as well.  http://www.zipcutpro.com/        My wife holding JP up.....  its a good thing we live far far away.....    Big Buck and Squid    Roy and da boys!    Paul Powis otherwise known as ""House""  LOL ( http://www.jpfish.com ) and ""Bull Dog""..  Paul kept me busy (distracting me I think..) whilst my wife was entertained with stories of Wales...  Bull Dog wanted to drive the Ridgline so badly I ""let"" him drive it back to the motel after dinner... lol.  your welcome... hahaha..  Paul by the way did the Filleting Fish Freshwater Edition DVD by Rapala    Pete and Esther     My wifey and two hacks...     At least I always wind up with the girl...  lol      Anyway, it was a GREAT day...  got to meet Big Jim finally and countless others, got some Gloomis shirts and had JP show me about this new indestructible line of Shimano rods, which are quit reasonable in price..  right up my alley!  Dinner and drinks were great, as always everyone there board members, including Dave and JP were generous beyond the call of duty.  Now I gotta get to work!!  Thanks to all for the $9 tallboys!!  If I missed anyone, accept my apology.. lol.. its too much in one day for a hick like me to remember.  "

I have my old age pension coming before the year is out but I don't think I'll retire yet.  Too much fun.  Hey TJ, I thought you were going to get into fly fishing.  Thought that's why I sent you those instruction videos some years back. Did you watch them?"
433650,bigbuck,2010-02-16 00:31:00,2449,"TJ, great pics!!! It was good to meet a few members in person but I had to get going, my little ones had enough sitting around so it was time to head home. The show was great and very informative. Now, to find some bullet head jigs to try out swim baits for some 'eyes. It was great to talk to Pete and Esther, Gord Pyzer, Dave Mercer, Doug Brownridge and countless others. Now I can't wait for softwater season."
