After a few skiers had some difficulty for the most part the rest of the field looked like they were scared to death to go down the hill and tried to get down the hill slow and safe, not exactly world class performances. One girl Canadian did not even start.  Props to the winner she put one hell of a gutsy run in, takes guts to win gold."

434440,POLLIWOGG,2010-02-18 05:23:00,835,I didn't see all of the races but I think that was good coaching to advise his skier not to start when the results of most of the others was in front of them with such a spread at the top scorers and the # of crashes.  Can't move on to the next event if your injured. She didn't not start because she was scared but because they were applying some strategy and didn't want too but an aggressive kid in a position to get hurt for little or no return.  There was a turn about half way where if they got too low it looked like they had to turn hard up hill to catch the gate and that really took the speed off them.
