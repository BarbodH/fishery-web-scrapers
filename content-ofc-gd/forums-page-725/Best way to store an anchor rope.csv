433948,Oggie,2010-02-16 19:42:00,588,Just wondering if anyone has a magical way to store 200' of anchor rope? I'm thinking about a wooden flat spool with the deep V cuts on each end. The rope is always under foot and I need to anchor both ends of the boat so I have twice the rope kicking around.  Ideas/solutions.  Dan O.
433956,wallyboss,2010-02-16 20:08:00,1095,This is the best way that I found.   Just make sure it is not a stiff nylon rope. a good anchor rope is needed. On my longer ones I usually fold them twice then I start the knotting of it. 
433971,Fang,2010-02-16 20:33:00,1330,"I have 100ft right now on a 12lb anchor and store both the anchor and rope (coiled and tied) in a blue recycling bag. Any of the heavier recycling shopping bags would work too. I got tired of tripping over rope or having it loose in the storage compartments. I looked at different ways of storing the rope but they all took up too much space. Tried seeing if an air hose spool or extension cord holder would work but never found anything rugged enough to last  and yellow nylon rope is the worst, get some good anchor rope like wb said"
433977,SlowPoke,2010-02-16 20:50:00,2984,"Tie the end to a bucket, feed the rope into the bucket any way you want and you're done. When you deploy the anchor, tie off the rope to the boat and leave the rest in the bucket. Just be sure to drain the bucket at the end of the day so your ropes don't rot."
434019,tomO,2010-02-16 23:04:00,363,I got a hose reel and attached it too the side of the boat and wrapped the rope around that. You cant retrieve the anchor with it but once you pull it in you can spool thr rope.
434023,bigugli,2010-02-16 23:13:00,6138,"Best way to store it is to keep it coiled and dry. A cheap tin electrical spool, or a hose reel,works great for coiling.  How you store it dry depends on the boat."
434036,HTHM,2010-02-16 23:36:00,4082,Consider using stainless steel cable on a hitch winch instead. Fasten the winch to the boat and you can deploy and wind up with the winch.
434065,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-17 00:54:00,10439,  Milk crates work great too!!!! No need to worry about draining either.
434110,Dara,2010-02-17 02:42:00,3052,I have a 2' long piece of 1x6 with a v notch in each end. I wrap 150' on it. Keep the anchor tied on. I need to put a hand hole in it so its easier to hang on to for wrapping and unspooling. Another trick is to put a knot in the rope a few feet from the end so you know when to watch it pulling it up so as not to bang the anchor into the boat and scratch it.
434167,Sinker,2010-02-17 06:40:00,8692,"I use a bucket too, works mint.  S."
434173,SlowPoke,2010-02-17 09:24:00,2984,You're right but I like to use the bucket as a bailer as well. Milk crates suck for bailing!
434215,smally21,2010-02-17 14:18:00,993,"ropes deploy well from a rope bag as long as they are stuffed randomly into the bag.  using a mesh bag will allow for some chance for the rope to dry, as we all know ropes suffer from mildew and rot.  synthetic double braids are pretty resistant.  i wash and hang my ropes regularly and they last forever.  just for interest wash your ropes with mild detergent in the washing machine.  ""daisy chain"" the rope to avoid tangling.  if you find a mesh bag you like you can just hang the bag up every now and then.  good luck."
434224,dave524,2010-02-17 14:33:00,4508,"I always preferred a nylon rope, being softer and more flexible. The stuff you don't want is the floating , stiff, often yellow in colour polypropylene ropes."
434243,wallyboss,2010-02-17 15:21:00,1095,The yellow rope is what I meant when I said Nylon rope.
434488,tomO,2010-02-18 15:02:00,363,Not to steal the thread but does any one use an achor pulley. thinkin about riggin one up on my boats.
