So my fishing days are going to be limited real soon  Anyways I thought since I am out that way I may as well get some fishing in. Does anyone know if there is enough open water on the east creeks to fish? or should I just pack the ice fishing gear and find some hardwater fishing instead.  Thanks in advance for any info"
