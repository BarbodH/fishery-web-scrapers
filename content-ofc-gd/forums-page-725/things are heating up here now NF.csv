434683,Handlebarz,2010-02-19 04:17:00,3790,I want to once again thank everyone for the offers of help to me and the family over the last 2 1/2 weeks I must say we were very lucky with the weather as the temps were nice so going that long with no furnace was not so bad the little heaters kept up great.  Today the part came in for the unit and the guys were over here to fix it before I got home from work I had a talk with them earlier in the week and made sure that they knew I was not happy about the first service call they understood and too kit off the bill and only charged me for the service call to find the broken heat exchanger and the 2.25 hours to install the new one. I am very happy with that I did not get to see the old one as I was at work I will try and see it tomorrow if I am not out of town before they open if not maybe next week if they are open if not Oh well. I dont feel they did me wrong so all is well here.  Once agai nthanks all Cheers Mike
