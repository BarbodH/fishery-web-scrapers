434791,Roy,2010-02-19 17:01:00,13728," Jon, go easy on the bondy baits thing. Four posts to our community and they're all thinly veiled attempts at steering folks to your site or baits. It would sound much better to everyone if you introduced yourself."
434795,Spiel,2010-02-19 17:29:00,9065,"Great link Dan, thanks!  I spent most of my ice fishing youth using nothing more than a hand line. To date my biggest lakers have come on that set-up and I still carry one with me on Simcoe. But to be honest I think a reel is a big plus when hitting up hard water steelies and kings, can't imagine the damage they might do to one's digits if hand lines were employed.   Good advice."
434797,Lanebros,2010-02-19 17:32:00,8,Ouch! I'm caught!!!!
434881,jaydub,2010-02-19 23:08:00,145,That fish was awesome and the ice was freakin incredible...almost would feel a bit like you're walkin on the water!

434155,kickingfrog,2010-02-17 04:22:00,8333,That clear ice is freaky. Kind of like the glass floor at the top of the CN Tower.
434157,highdrifter,2010-02-17 04:25:00,2534,Yah that's a classic!  How do you get a nose bleed from just sheer exitement??  I want one too!
434159,BillM,2010-02-17 04:27:00,17367,Holy crap!!   Glad to see the guy let it go...
434161,redneck666,2010-02-17 04:42:00,563,"i cant move em! i cant move him! you see that? i cant move em!  haha, classic vid."
434163,solopaddler,2010-02-17 05:38:00,8605,"Holy buckets?  Dooood   (That was a super cool video, thanks for posting)."
434165,Sinker,2010-02-17 06:08:00,8692,Awesome video!
434175,Roy,2010-02-17 09:34:00,13728,Just an amazing clip Dan. Thanks for posting it. That one's got to be everyone's ice fishing fantasy.
434192,Musky or Specks,2010-02-17 12:39:00,2710,Infreakingcredible thank 4 the vid
434194,MJL,2010-02-17 12:50:00,2427,HOLY BUCKETS!!!  That was perhaps the vid that inspired me to try ice fishing for lakers with my friends this year.  Been watching that vid 2-3 times a week the last month and a half to keep me pumped after weeks of blanking.  Gotta love this vid of his too. 
434201,Joey,2010-02-17 13:22:00,9122,"Wow, unbelievable video Dan, thanks!  Head Rush  Joey"
434214,solopaddler,2010-02-17 14:16:00,8605,Some interesting info unearthed in the replies. He was asked why not use a rod and reel? He said they do when fishing shallower. They were fishing in 200 FEET OF WATER. (WOW) He said steel handlines and heavy 3-4oz jigs allow them to get a better feel for the hits.  That's just unbelievable and absolutely fascinating imo. Adds more to an already incredible thing.  Boy oh boy there must be a lot of monsters lurking in the extreme depths of Superior.
434325,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-17 21:34:00,158,"I love when he says, ""this thing needs to go on weight watchers.""  That was a fatty."
434331,MooseMerch,2010-02-17 21:52:00,68,nice laker bud
434335,BillM,2010-02-17 22:00:00,17367,My video would have been rated PG13 for language if I hooked that behemoth.
434336,solopaddler,2010-02-17 22:04:00,8605," Yeah I highly doubt ""holy buckets!! would be part of your vocabulary."
434415,waterwolf,2010-02-18 02:43:00,556,insane battle on a hand line .just a great story on video .  thanks for sharin' that wild ride .  congrats on a true trophy!!
434517,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-18 17:02:00,1362,Holy Crap Dan.......thanks for the link to that video!!....amazing Laker through the ice!!....Now that just got the blood pumping and now I'm as stoked as ever for my 5 day Temagami journey next week!!!!!!!!!
434531,adempsey,2010-02-18 18:05:00,1498,That guy deserved that fish.  You know he really enjoyed catching (and releasing) it.   Laker of a lifetime.
434627,brkygetr,2010-02-19 01:57:00,425,"Wow un-freaking WOW!!!!! It will come out of Superior, that being the largest laker ever. May the gods of Gitchagumi (probably spelled wrong) give a man who hand lines a laker like that credit...he deserves it!  oh yeah and the ice with the hand augered hole is surreal."
434636,smitter,2010-02-19 02:27:00,106,holy buckets thats a big laker!
434664,danc,2010-02-19 03:28:00,4677,"Glad you all liked the video. It was sent to me from a friend.  I guess that I'm getting to be one of those ""old"" guys on the board that keep saying, ""when I was younger"", but this is a classic example. What is the purpose of an 18"" or 24"" long ice fishing rod? What's wrong with hand lining a fish through the ice? I've caught my share of decent fish through the ice including 20 lb. Pike and Lake Trout. All have been hand lined. Man, that's the fun of it. Just like the guy in the video. I'd much rather have hand lined that fish than reeled it in with a foot and a half fishing rod. We'd bring a couple of spools of mono, some hooks and some bait. We'd gather some nice slender willow branches form shore to set our lines on. You can't beat a willow branch for sensitivity. Sometimes the minnow alone would keep you running to your line all day.  Bottom line here? Don't be afraid to start with, or go back to the basics. Learning the habits of your fish of choice will pay much bigger dividends than having a 13"" float rod or using fluorocarbon leaders ever will. I've never taken a cast with braid in my life. Probably never will. Why? Because mono works just fine for me. By the way, mono has come a long long way in the past 20 years.  If you want to catch a behemoth Lake Trout through the ice, try hand lining. That's what I would do."
434720,solopaddler,2010-02-19 12:01:00,8605,  That's the way I grew up doing it as well Dan. The difference here is the guy said they normally use rods and reels. They were using steel handlines because they were fishing in 200' of water. That's just amazing to me.
