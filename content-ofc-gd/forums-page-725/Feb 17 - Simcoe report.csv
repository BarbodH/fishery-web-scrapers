Drove over 25km all over the lake in search of those elusive lakers...nada....it looks like this maybe my first ever ice season without Simcoe laker...not sure where they are but didn't see a single one caught by the many many fisherman I've stopped and talk to.... Oh well....got the routine limit of white fish...lost several on thw way up...marked a lot but many of them window shoppers... Then went and got 33 perch....  Now who is going to do all the cleaning Meegs did all the damage today...in 80-ish fow... Perch were suicidal...my MarCUM was lit like a Christmas three all the time non stop...anything I gave them they wanted it  Really tired...but here is a shot from the day (too damn cod to do it on the ice).... Both whities were stocked this time.    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

434554,dheitzner,2010-02-18 20:41:00,314,"I had tons of window shoppers yesterday as well, in fact, I ended up going home with another skunk! Unlike the last couple, I definitely don't have the lakers or whities dialed in this year. Mind if I ask what colour Meegs, and if it was tipped with anything? Darcy"
