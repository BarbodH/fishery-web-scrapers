433533,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 21:20:00,618,"Anyone else buy one of these? It's the SAME damned colour as their Gold Xraps   . Which by the way I have never had luck on.  The site shows that RC is much darker than Gold...not so in person.  Here's a pic of a Gold 10 size, and the 08 Rusty Craw...  This isn't really a rant so much as just letting folks know about this...  "
433543,timmeh,2010-02-15 21:42:00,609,"Well that's marketing for you. All those new colours are designed to catch the fisherman not the fish. I should know, I have half of them in my tackle box, many which have never caught anything.    And now I rarely use any rapalas and when I do it's only 2 or 3 key colours.  And oddly enough I've done okay with the gold colour."
433547,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 21:47:00,618,"I think I just haven't gave the gold enough of a chance.  My go-to colours/rapalas for Walleye, Pike, and Bass are as follows:  1) XRap in CLOWN 2) XRap in White Ghost 3) Anything Fire Tiger  My big prospects for landing Eye's this year are the following...  XRap Shad in Clown Clackin' Rap in Yellow Perch  I am also going to give the Purple Ghost XRap more of a chance this year..."
433564,redneck666,2010-02-15 22:16:00,563,shadrap rs in perch is what's gunna occupy my eye this year... im determined to finally catch a pike or walleye on the damned thing... maybe even a bass...
433569,EC1,2010-02-15 22:24:00,930," I had very high hopes with a 08? sized Purple Ghost xrap last year, and all it ever hooked me was a muskie and nothing else ever again! The white does seem promising, I think I will be getting that sometime this year  BTW, that orange colour does look like a good fish catching colour anyways."
433578,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 22:38:00,618,"  I've done well on bass with the White Ghost but never really gave it a chance for Walleye as I was too busy catching them on perch/clown crawler harnesses and Clown Xraps, but I wanna start throwing more crankbaits for eye's this season."
433581,timmeh,2010-02-15 22:40:00,609,I've had good luck for pike with the white ghost xrap just before and after the sun goes down. Don't fish for eyes much so can't really say.  The one colour that I can't seem to hit with is the clown. Everyone else seems to do well but can't seem to get it to work for me.
433583,pike slayer,2010-02-15 22:43:00,1177,ive done well on all colours but perch!! fish cant get enough of them!
433585,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 22:46:00,618,  Don't feel bad Clown has done nothing for Bass or Pike for me really. But Walleye seem to take a liking to them .   Agreed!! I bought a Perch Xrap thinking I'd clean up with it in Rock Lake...but nothing...meanwhile Perch bladed crawlers are the ticket in that lake...go figure??
433586,purekgw,2010-02-15 22:47:00,585,"i have caught dozens of fish on the gold xraps in the river and in the kawarthas and never got anything on fire tiger, i actually bought 2 gold color ones cause the gold color produced tons of walleye and musky until a musky finally got away with it"
433591,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-15 22:56:00,3761,I got a 10 size in that gold and in purple ghost...had a gold in the 08 and it worked fine for early season bass...but i lost it and the 10 don't work for me...bought a clown colored and another colored 08 sized xraps...we shall see
433592,jace,2010-02-15 22:57:00,472,They look completely different to me.  One has an orange feather with orange krystal flash.  the other has a fuscia feather with pearl krystal flash.
433595,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 23:00:00,618,  Know how I know you're gay? You know what the colour fuscia looks like.  :D
433596,Twocoda,2010-02-15 23:05:00,4130,  do you think he could actually spell it though ???   oops just re read ...he did know ...but ...so do you now...lmao
433620,solopaddler,2010-02-15 23:48:00,8605,Looks like two different colours to me.
433649,steverowbotham,2010-02-16 00:30:00,1800, Me too
433652,archie_james_c,2010-02-16 00:32:00,618,Quite the subtle differences dont ya think...
433661,redneck666,2010-02-16 00:46:00,563,"actually both of them pretty well look the same as my hot steel xrap... kinda.... i think its called hot steel, haha."
434170,adempsey,2010-02-17 07:17:00,1498,"I'd say they are different enough.  However, I wouldn't buy both colors in the same lure/size.."
434232,CLofchik,2010-02-17 15:01:00,854," Ha the Hot Steel has an aquamarine back with a subtle transition to the gold with an eggshell undersides........ Uh....(manly voice), blue back, light belly.   Heh that's the one colour usable Xrap I still have left.  No love in Steeltown for Hot Steel, forget pike even the drum wouldn't touch it."
434256,solopaddler,2010-02-17 16:44:00,8605,"    Interesting how Rapalas Hot Steel colour differs from lure to lure.  Here's the one you guys are talking about. I had never seen this colour before:    All of Rapalas other lures in the Hot Steel colour look like this:    I've used the hot steel Shad Rap and Minnow Rap, both have worked fantastically for me."
434439,CLofchik,2010-02-18 05:15:00,854," Lol I wonder if there's some Rapala/Spro exclusive success correlation?  Like GM or Ford at a NASCAR race, you're either one or the other?  This deserves further study."
