434367,ped,2010-02-18 00:13:00,16,How do you jig it? My sister was jigging it in an up and down motion and lost two at the pressure crack near IBP.
434368,Syn,2010-02-18 00:19:00,519,Were the hooks sticky sharp?
434372,ped,2010-02-18 00:24:00,16,"ya, that was no problem. It's just that my sister never sets the hooklol"

434380,BillM,2010-02-18 00:49:00,17367,"You rarely 'set the hook', it's usually on the upswing of the jig that you hook into the buggers.  Gotta make sure your hooks are super sticky and keep the pressure on them."
434570,Eazy,2010-02-18 21:42:00,260,"I won't say that they don't work, but these lures are notorious for hog-tieing.."
434595,xeon,2010-02-18 23:36:00,350,"I haven't had much problem with them tangling up personally, and I use one hard for pike and walleye and also something for flash.  My jig for pike or walleye consists of letting it hit the bottom, then ripping it hard up and down a few times, holding it a few inches above bottom and letting it untwist itself for a few seconds while bumping it up and down a few times followed by one sharper pull up, then repeating the hard rips every few minutes. I usually tip with a minnow tail.  Would help if you said what you were fishing for."
434618,cram,2010-02-19 01:13:00,1733," If you're not fishing for whitefish, take the hooks out of the side.  As far as i can tell those hooks are for whitefish picking it up off the bottom."
