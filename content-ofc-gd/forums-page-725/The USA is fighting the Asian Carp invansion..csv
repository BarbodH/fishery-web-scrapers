434506,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-18 15:45:00,0,"""Michigan has asked the U. S. Supreme Court to order Chicago- area shipping locks closed to keep carp out, a request supported by Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Illinois opposes the closure""  I wish Obamarama would stop sheltering his home town and start protecting the the other states and the international waters.  He's just as useless as Bush for environmental issues."
434508,canadadude,2010-02-18 15:59:00,769,"He's as useless as Bush on every issue, he's a great talker but falls short as an actuall doer."
434511,bigfish1965,2010-02-18 16:28:00,3382,"Uhh...can you guys keep this on issue and not about the leader of another country, please. It has had nothing to do with the the office of the President until this point. Not to belittle the issue, but both Bush and Obama had bigger things to worry about."
434513,bigugli,2010-02-18 16:34:00,6138,So I gather that the plan is to make spot trapping a daily ritual until it is too late?
434514,Mike Pike,2010-02-18 16:37:00,1332,"Ya, spot trapping sounds like something you do just so you can say you're doing something.  Can't imagine it being very effective."
434560,aplumma,2010-02-18 20:54:00,6896,Yup lets set fire to this thread I am officially telling Every last PERSON that I Art Melancon Have decided to allow the Asian Carp get into OUR (Canada and USA) Great lakes so the fishing industry crashes. I want to do irreversible harm to both Great nations and OBAMA is in agreement with ME and is doing Everything that I tell HIM to DO just so the OFC American bashing Nitwit squad can show all of the Rest of the Board that they are small minded idiots.... Now does this make it clear that if you can't leave bashing politics tactics aside and talk with facts and expertise then don't comment and prove that you are an American Bashing  Art

434565,Roy,2010-02-18 21:15:00,13728,This thread was doomed from the very start. I'm sure that most people knew that.
