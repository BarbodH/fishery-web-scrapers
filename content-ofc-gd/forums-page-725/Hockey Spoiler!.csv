434494,JohnF,2010-02-18 15:24:00,3494," No argument about the Russians. But a lot of observers were a little surprised at how ineffectual they looked in Game 1. Any team that went up against them not expecting a tough game would be stupid. Canada appeared to be using that first game to get a feel for lines, figuring out who paired up best. Gonna be some fun hockey to watch over the next couple of weeks.  And I checked out Getzlaf. He's an old creaky 24 with 4 years pro experience. I'm sure they've already fitted him up with a special pylon orange sweater since there are all of 4 Russians younger than him and one of them's a goalie.  JF"
434495,Raf,2010-02-18 15:25:00,3495,it'll be usa vs canada in the final  team with the hottest goalie wins.
434497,JohnF,2010-02-18 15:29:00,3494, And now that the officials have demoralized all the US goalies by making them cover up stuff on their nifty new helmets we'll have the edge.  JF
434502,canadadude,2010-02-18 15:37:00,769,"I choked on the forwards due to one man,Federov who is 40yrs old this brings the Russian average way up, I think he's just there as a token to his years of outstanding play for the Russian Federation.  In the defence end of the average, Drew Doughty at 20 brings Canada's average way down and to have him on the roster and leave Mike Green off is the most ridiculous move I've seen in olympice hockey, except for leaving Crosby off the poor excuse team we sent to the last Olympics.Mike Green is the highest point defenceman in the league year in year out by a long shot and after the lack of offence and goals in the last Olympics I think there would be a place on the roster for the best offensive defencmen in the NHL.  The other thing that peaved me off with Canada's roster is leaving Steve Stamkos off the team, come on the dude's got 35 goals so far this season well on his way to a 50+ goal year. He more then proved himself in international competition in his short hockey career. He is a pure goal scorer, something I would think Canada needs in this tournament, this guy has great hands , a great shot, excellent skater, yet he watches the tournament on T.V give me a break.  Canada should maybe get a General Manager to pick the roster instead of ex hockey heros"
434504,canadadude,2010-02-18 15:40:00,769,By the way I hope Canada wins gold  .........and if they do I will gladly eat crow and take all the I told you so's you guys fire in my general direction
434522,Cookslav,2010-02-18 17:32:00,1457," Thats a popular stance, and I'd tend to agree... I think the Canadian team is deeper in talent though one thing for contemplation is most people forget the ability to play as a team will more often then not overcome individual talent.  The question at hand is the American team going to gel. I guess the Same could be said for the russians, and the Canadians though LOL...  Its anyones guess but I'd agree its going to be  USA vs Canada Final, but the russians are a dark horse favorite"
434586,canadadude,2010-02-18 22:49:00,769,"USA vs CANADA final..........gotta be a long shot hahahahha....... Russia republic vs Sweden, would be my pick.... Canada a forth at best heheheh"
434587,JohnF,2010-02-18 22:52:00,3494," Never say die, eh?  JF"
434591,canadadude,2010-02-18 23:04:00,769,"are you kidding me.....Russia is by far the deepest team in talent.....after that said it's pretty close for 5 of the top teams.   Findland, russia, usa, check's, sweed's, slovakia,canada are all about equal in tallent, I think Russia has the best, but all that  being said it's the team who runs on all cylinders is going to win this competition.The gold medal is up for grabs and from what I've seen so far it's still up for grabs! Anyone of the teams I mentioned have the talent to win this thing, Canada is just one team in the mix, anyone of the for mentioned teams has the tallent to go all the way."
434601,ADB,2010-02-19 00:09:00,444," I'm getting sick and tired of everyone jumping on the Russia bandwagon.  Yes, they have a lot of very talented players, and one of the best in the world in Ovechkin.  But honestly, please be rational, are their players really better than the Canadians?  It seems like everyone is blinded by the flashy play of the Russians and is ignoring the facts.  I'm going to make this post a long one, because I want to put this issue to bed, once and for all.  The Russian Roster:  Forwards: Ovechkin - One of the best in the world, I won't argue that. Malkin - Another one of the best in the world. 1 Stanley Cup. Semin - Great player, but have never scored more than 38 goals or 79 points in a season Kovalchuk - Awesome player, has scored many many goals, but has never scored more than 100 points. Datsyuk - Awesome player, but again, has never scored more than 100 points. 2 Stanley Cups. Radulov - Hasn't played in the NHL since 2007/2008, and had a total of 58 points in 81 games Afinogenov - One of the streakiest players in the league, so much so that Atlanta only signed him because he was willing to play for less than $1 000 000 Federov - Was a great player, but in his last season registered only 11 goals and 33 points in 52 games.  3 Stanley Cups. Kozlov - No longer players in the NHL, and when he did, was an average NHLer. Morozov - See Kozlov. Zinovjev - Washed up prospect that has 1 career NHL point. Zaripov - Hars never played an NHL game.  Defense Markov - One of the best in the game, no questions asked Gonchar - Can certainly score, but is a defensive liability. 1 Stanley Cup. Volchenkov - Good defenseman. Kalinin - Average defenseman. Grebeshkov - Young, but average defenseman. Tyutin - Average defenseman. Korneyev - Never played an NHL game Nikulin - Never played an NHL game.  Goalies Nabokov - Great career, but has never won when it's mattered. Varlamov - Great goalie, but young and unproven. Bryzgalov - Great goalie who is having a great year, but has never been a winner in the league.  The Canadian Roster:  Forwards Crosby - One of the best in the world. 1 Stanley Cup. Thornton - Multiple 100 point seasons. Heatley - Multiple 100 point seasons. Iginla - Great player, many 90 point seasons, but has never scored 100. Getzlaf - One of the best young players in the game.  1 Stanley Cup. Nash - Great player, has won the Rocket Richard, but has never scored more than 79 points in a year. Staal - Great player, has scored 100 points in a season in his career. 1 Stanley Cup. Marleau - Great player, has never scored 100 points in a season, has great chemistry with Heatley and Thornton. Perry - One of the best young players in the game.  1 Stanley Cup. Richards - Great leader, and one of the best young players in the NHL. Morrow - Great power forward, but not really a numbers guy. Toews -  See Perry. Bergeron - Great talents, but has not proved much in the NHL.  Defense Neidermayer - One of the best defenseman of all time, although he is ageing. 3 Stanley Cups. Pronger - See Neidermayer. 1 Stanley Cup. Weber - One of the best defensemen in the game, 53 points last yeat. Keith - Can point up points, and is part of the best shutdown pairing in the NHL with Seabrook on Chicago. Seabrook - Is part of the best shutdown pairing in the NHL with Keith on Chicago. Doughty - The best young defesemen in the game, on pace for 50 points this year. Boyle - One of the best scoring defensemen in the game with four 50+ point seasons, though can be a defensive liability.  1 Stanley Cup.  Goalies Brodeur - One of the best goalies of all time.  3 Stanley Cups. Luongo - One of the best goalies in the game, although he has not proved much in the playoffs. Fleury - Great goalie.  1 Stanley Cups.  The point??? Russian players have won 7 cups, while Canadians have won 13.  Canadians have more points, even though they are, as JohnF pointed out, younger on average.  Even Russian's ""best"" players are comparable with the Canadians when you actually look at the stats and don't let their flashiness fool you.  Anyone who wants to argue further, go ahead, just bring some substance to the table."
434623,redneck666,2010-02-19 01:47:00,563,thanks ADB!  if your not cheering for canada your a communist!  :P

434625,redneck666,2010-02-19 01:53:00,563,"  me too! guess who just scored...???? sui....... dang! hahaha. well, periods over im gunna go for a short sled ride."
434643,redneck666,2010-02-19 03:04:00,563,look who WON!...... canada?? i thought they would have LOST!...  lol their goin for gold people. if your canadian you should be cheering for your country you communists!  just razzin' haha.  GO CANADA!
434699,Cookslav,2010-02-19 04:48:00,1457," Actually...I think the Russians have a killer offence, and thats about it. Not a doubt in my Mind Canada has the more depth?  The offensive talent of the Russian team is impressive, and I'd say any team who plays them better stay outta of the box... But Canada has this neat little thing they do some times....its called BACK CHECKING, and its the Russian Nemisis.  If the Canadians play ""their"" game, Back check, stay out of the box, and hit hard the Russians will crumble. The only way you'll see Russia beat them is if the Canadians take dumb penaties, and they loose the neutral zone coverage.  The Russian have a whole lotta fire powerf for sure, But not much in the way of team or Character players to motivate and their Checking line is sadly lacking... Actually I don't even think they have a checking line LOL..."
434113,redneck666,2010-02-17 02:50:00,563,"so, there is canada's first game so far! 8-0! took norway by storm! hahaha."

434189,Blake,2010-02-17 12:19:00,418,Great game last night.  Firts period was nerve racking being 0-0 but the second and third period Canada's team was out to win and caught fire.  great game and the plays and passing were awesome.  Canada for GOLD!!!!!
434231,knightfisher,2010-02-17 14:59:00,237,"Canada should win gold. The players are all multi millionaire professionals. The rest of the countries apart from the US, not so.  We have the best team money can buy"
434237,Rich Clemens,2010-02-17 15:03:00,3131,Probably the first hockey game I watched in my life ... what a great game it was for our Canadian friends.
434239,snoil,2010-02-17 15:04:00,139,Ovechkin and the rest of Team Russia could buy the place.Kovalchuk just turned down $110 million!!
434244,JohnF,2010-02-17 15:28:00,3494," I don't know this for certain but I suspect that many of the players you'll be watching are being paid to play hockey somewhere. Europe has pro teams galore. The Russian hockey league is paying big bux.  It's not just hockey that's been bought out either. I've read or heard snowboarders describe themselves as professionals. The American kid with the long red hair flies by helicopter to his private fullsized halfpipe in the mountains somewhere. There are curling teams who are paid to do nothing but curl for their country. The day of the true amateur is dying fast if not already dead. It's understandable though as there's no way modern athletes can fund their own training and equipment costs and hope to be competitive. One need only look at the NCAA to know there's big money in ""amateur"" sports.  JF"
434251,canadadude,2010-02-17 16:23:00,769,"Oh boy we beat Norway hahahahahaha. Russia will make the Canadians look like pylons out on the ice. I still get frustrated when our young tallented players sit and watch on T.V while the old guard plays on there 3rd olympic team. The old guys looked ok last night, but this is Norway there playing against."
434254,blaque,2010-02-17 16:32:00,2419,"Yeah, youd have to include russia in that circle as well. I mean.........I watched the boys in red last night and C'mon........  Ovechkin Malkyn Kovalchuk Semin Datsyuk (spellcheck lol) Federov..........as a side note, they quoted him as saying ""he doesnt miss the NHL......only the friends he made while playing there"". I dunno what that means, but its a strange comment for sure.  I have to say that I get more of an olympic feel watching the Womens Hockey games as thats what i think the olympics should be more about. You can sense the excitement and can feel that this is a dream situation to them...........you know what im saying.  Oh and here is Shaun Whites personal mountain halfpipe built for him by Red Bull He is to snowboarding what Tony Hawk was and is to skateboarding. Im on the fence with all this. I mean on one hand........its ludicrous but on the same token, hes a good guy and good for him i guess.  "
434306,JohnF,2010-02-17 20:49:00,3494, The Russians had better get with the program before they meet Canada then. By all accounts they didn't look brilliant in their first game.  JF
434307,JohnF,2010-02-17 20:50:00,3494, Old guys? What planet are you watching hockey on?  JF
434308,anders,2010-02-17 20:56:00,1168,"Your absolutly right JohnF...there are many athletes at the olympics that are paid millions to do there sport, but endorsments also.  I read a week ago an article about the highest paid olympians other than hockey and Lindsey Vonn makes near 8 million a year, Shawn White was up there as well.  The olympics are really not becoming the event that amatuers thrived to attend."

434330,brifishrgy,2010-02-17 21:49:00,559,  so did I .. if you cant watch the game live DONT COME HERE FIRST.. there was nothing offensive in the tittle .. mods tryin to justify their position I suppose
434350,canadadude,2010-02-17 23:26:00,769,"over 35 is old in the hockey world these days.  Pronger, Neidamier, Ignalia. Wheres Green, Phanuf and Stamkos the young Canadian Talent deserves a shot.  Canada won't advance far enough in this tournament to meet Russia, the same as Gretzky's 2006 team this bunch ain't going anywhere"

434360,canadadude,2010-02-17 23:44:00,769,Wisdom don't win hockey games and I lost my youth 30yrs ago
434482,JohnF,2010-02-18 14:41:00,3494," I like to deal in facts (sometimes) and here are a few facts I discovered by looking up the rosters for Team Canada and Team Russia.  Our goaltenders have an average age of 32, the Russians 29. They win the youth award there but is 29 really that young in modern professional hockey?  Our D-men average 30 while the Russians average about 9 months more. Point to the Canucks there. Frankly I'd rather have big smart old D-men though.  Canuck forwards average 3 months over 27 while the Russians are 3 months short of 30. Looks like you really choked on that one. Youth and good wheels up front are great. I'd say our boys have just the right blend of youth and experience to do fine so hopefully they won't let their old age impede their success.  BTW The youngest players are Doughty (Cdn), a Russian goalie & Toews are a year older than Drew, then Crosby.  The oldest players are a Russian forward born in '69, Brodeur '72, Niedemeyer '73, then a Russian D and Pronger '74, sounds pretty even with perhaps a slight edge to Canada. Personally I think Pronger's a jackass but he is still a helluva D-man.  I just noticed that Getzlaf isn't on my list. Perhaps he's older than he looks and will raise the average up high enuf to work for you. The rosters I used are from the internet and there may have been changes but the Canuck names all sound familiar so my ""facts"" should be pretty good still.  JF"
434487,Cookslav,2010-02-18 14:58:00,1457," ZING!!!!!   Sorry...couldn't help my self LOL... I think the Canadian Team Is solid, Its about as good as its gonna get IMO But the Russian team does scare me a bit....we'll see"
