433784,CED8ED,2010-02-16 11:48:00,3,Planning a trip up and need to stay in touch. How is cell service on South Bay? Any dead spots?
433797,John,2010-02-16 12:44:00,2956,"Good morning and welcome, hope you like it here. Tell us a little about yourself, you will find everyone warmer and a little more receptive that way.  I can't comment too much about South Bay, but the only service that works for me on the West Arm is Rogers, which still comes and goes. I had Bell and my wife has Telus and neither worked at all."
433829,Headhunter,2010-02-16 14:04:00,5703,Never had a problem with my Rogers phone on south bay... full bars and no dead spots. HH
434033,Gerritt,2010-02-16 23:30:00,6129,Yup Rogers seems to work.... Telus on the other hand
434045,Muskieman,2010-02-17 00:12:00,2472,Hello !!! and WELCOME ABOARD!!!  'Hope you stick around ... No dead spots.
434053,Bernie,2010-02-17 00:28:00,3190,"I almost live at the South Bay area. 4 miles west of Powassan cells are dead. Bell and Rogers anyway. Fish Bay is a dead zone (even for my recent Rogers cell) and sections of Hunters Bay can be bad too. Once out on the main body of the lake it is OK, I suspect the line of sight to North Bay allows it."
434193,sandybay,2010-02-17 12:39:00,64,Rogers is putting a new tower up at hwy 534 and Wolfe lake rd. this year. They started it last year and put it on hold. They have told people in Pt Loring to expect service.
434264,Bernie,2010-02-17 17:46:00,3190,Thanks Jeff. I heard that it was supposed to go last year too but nothing came of it so far. Don't know if it will work in Loring or not. Still a few miles from Wolfe Lake.
434316,bubbles,2010-02-17 21:05:00,591,No issues with Telus when I was up there a few weeks ago
434460,sandybay,2010-02-18 12:48:00,64,"They cleared the lot and put the road in last year then stopped, Nipissing Fire dept. and road Dept. are supposed to get repeaters installed on the tower for better radio comm."
