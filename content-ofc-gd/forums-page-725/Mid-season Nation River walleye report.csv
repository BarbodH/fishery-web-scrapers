However this week the fish have really turned on. Been moving around to a number of spots, with most outings producing one or two table-sized fish. From my experience the sturgeon seem to be increasing in numbers, some traditional walleye/sauger spots have been inundated with sturgeon and ling. Two of the larger sturgeon have been mid 20 pound fish (released back as quickly as possible), ling at 5 and 5.5 pounds. I have since moved off of these spots after a couple of outings due to the number of out of season sturgeon present there. A few nice walleye have been landed with two just over the 7 pound mark(both released). One outing even produced a catfish at almost 40 feet of water on the Ottawa, caught on a water bug that surfaced in one the holes drilled in the ice. Here are a few pictures from this winters so far.  Stick Bug catching catfish   Nation 7 pound   Sauger   5 pound Ling   3.5 pound   monster walleye "
