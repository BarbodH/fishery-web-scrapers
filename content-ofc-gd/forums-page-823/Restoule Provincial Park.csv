358435,Pike_Nut71,2009-07-04 12:03:00,18,Hey all! I am heading to Restoule PP this Tuesday with the family for our annual camping trip and would like any info on the fishing up there. We have a 14 foot tinny and would really like to find some walleye or bass to enhance the kids camping experiance.
358455,ChrisK,2009-07-04 13:46:00,2772,I was at Restoule lake years ago for the first time and what we did is explore around....I'm not sure if this is were you will be fishing because there is a small stream connecting Restoule Lake to a body of water beside it but what I can tell you is Restoule Lake isn't that big and can be traversed in a day even in a small 14 footer with a smaller motor....We just went to weeds and rock and worked it out from there...  Good Luck !!
358465,ch312,2009-07-04 14:39:00,1590,dont forget your pike and musky gear  just hit the weeds or rocky points and you shouldnt have a problem finding fish. hit the government dock with the kids for an endless supply of rockbass.

Will update on return.  Tony"
358525,bow slayer,2009-07-04 19:16:00,1074,Hey Pike I will be there from Monday JULY 06 to July 19th. I have been going there for about 20 years. Stop by my site  in the Kettle Point area site # 426 and I can help you out.

There are lots of smallies in the lake and decent walleye although it can be a tough lake to fish.  It seems that sometimes the fish dont bite on restoule more then other lakes.  Its been a while since i fished the lake but if you want smallies i would cruise up to patterson lake for a better chance at good numbers of smallies.  Look forward to your report!  The restoule area is one of the nicest places in ontario!!  Cheers!"
