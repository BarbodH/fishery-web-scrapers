It needs to be properly reinforced but it is a great system.  It is called Bert's tracking system.  I rigged up my downriggers, a couple of rod holders, net holder and tool holder."

They have a ton of accessories available.  They're ratcheting rod holders are incredible and are now available in plastic at half the price. I can't vouch for the plastic ones as I haven't tried them yet.  The planer mast is nice and it was a toss up for me between Bert's and Riviera. I opted for the Riviera 7"" telescoping mast but if it wasn't on sale, I would have went Bert's.  There are a few manufacturers in this format; Bert's, Traxstech and now Cannon"
