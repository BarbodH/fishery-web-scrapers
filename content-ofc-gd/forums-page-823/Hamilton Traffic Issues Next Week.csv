358516,JohnF,2009-07-04 18:21:00,3494,I'll be commuting from Stratford to Hamilton (York Blvd) every day for the next two weeks and don't want to be late. I'm doing a real estate license course there and it's awkward if the teacher is late. Any traffic problems (construction etc) I should know about coming in 403 from Brantford and down the hill to just past the golf course?  Thanks in advance for any help.  JF
358517,CLofchik,2009-07-04 18:34:00,854,"If you're commuting in regular rush hours leave a little extra, that hill gets packed with suburban numbnuts and there's no alternatives.  Keep the speed down, that stretch on top of the Escarpment is heavily patrolled from Brantford-Hamilton.  It might be quicker to come in on the 401 and down Hwy. 6, traffic flow on 6 would be going in the opposite directions."
358520,JohnF,2009-07-04 18:44:00,3494, I should be hitting the hill just before 8am. Other times I seem to just squeak in ahead of the worst traffic then.  I'll check out the #6 route though. Thanks.  JF
358579,jjcanoe,2009-07-04 23:35:00,744,Hwy #6 going up and down the hill is under big time construction.  Give yourself about 15-20 mins extra and you sjhould be fine.  make sure you avoid the traffic in K-W as well!  jjcanoe
358588,JohnF,2009-07-05 00:26:00,3494, Maybe I'd be better taking my chances with the 403 then. I'll go via the 403 tomorrow and go home by #6 and see what's what then.  Jeez. You guys are confusing me.  JF
358610,fishing n autograph,2009-07-05 01:55:00,2540,403 would be a better option because even the commute from Stratford through Kitchener was a pain when I worked there.....
358621,JohnF,2009-07-05 02:22:00,3494, I pick up 403 at Woodstock so I miss Kitchener traffic.  JF
358623,HTHM,2009-07-05 02:25:00,4082,"Forget it, you can't here from there....403 all the way. Wanna do lunch? You're buyin"
358671,JohnF,2009-07-05 12:57:00,3494, The students seem to like me to hang around at lunch so they can ask questions. I don't mind. It keeps things running better in class and let's me get away quicker at the end of the day.  JF
