Kyle needs to take a page from older brother.Starting to like the older brother.  As for junior.Wrong place at the wrong time.Never had the car anyways."
358637,danc,2009-07-05 03:37:00,4677,I agree..
358640,misfish,2009-07-05 03:42:00,29133,"  On what? JR or Kyle.LOL  I know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BOTH."
358648,danc,2009-07-05 04:28:00,4677,LOL... I agree that Smoke did nothing wrong.
358658,Chris,2009-07-05 10:31:00,405,I hate the blocking in racing and KB got what he deserved. They should change Smoke's name to Fire as he is on fire lately.
358700,steelhead hunter,2009-07-05 15:44:00,152,It's about time kyle got what he deserves he will wreck anyone to win and then say thats racing now he wrecks himself so tony wins  . Tony did nothing wrong except for being in 2nd when kyle wrecked good for tony
358757,Lowe Rider,2009-07-05 19:57:00,79,"Just watched it this morning. It was his own fault, Tony had a fender on him and he drove right across  and spin himself out. I am amazed at the strength of those damn cars. Bush was hit hard three separate times, nose, rear and drivers door. He got out and was all mad, didn't even look like it fazed him. Had that oh well just another day at the office look about him."
358818,Daplumma,2009-07-06 01:13:00,1961,"Smoke is on fire for sure.He is lovin life and for good reason.I would like to see an owner driver win this year.Kyle is such a little punk,I hope the rest of the year ends like that race for him.Smashing that guitar showed the ultimate disrespect for the history of the series.He could learn from the history,like blocking on the last lap at a plate race.We lost one of the finest that way. Joe"
358847,Rattletrap2,2009-07-06 02:28:00,1652,and...on the plus side of things......Tony is a serious Bass fishing fanatic and a real gentleman!
358848,Joey,2009-07-06 02:29:00,9122,  Damn straight
