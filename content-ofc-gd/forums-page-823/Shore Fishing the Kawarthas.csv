358032,Dan668,2009-07-03 01:15:00,1120,Mosquitoes hate them. WHen the come out its horrible. But an hour after isnt too bad. Last year i had better luck on chemong. But i rarely went. Guess ill have to check it out haha
358033,Dan668,2009-07-03 01:16:00,1120,bug spray never works
358712,Dan668,2009-07-05 17:13:00,1120,Ended up trying numerous areas. Not much action. Windy all day. Was really calm at night but still ended up with a few bass and crappie. Nothing big. Ah well a day out is always is good.
