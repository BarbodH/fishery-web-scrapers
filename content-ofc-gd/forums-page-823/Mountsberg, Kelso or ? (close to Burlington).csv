Doesn't need to be a secret spot, but a place where we're at least going to catch some pan fish / rock bass etc.  It'd be nice to show him a nice little Pike.  I've heard the conservation areas might be worth checking out (Close to Burlington). Any feedback on which may produce something without being shoulder to shoulder with others?  Ideas welcome!  Thanks, I'm Hooked."
358321,bigugli,2009-07-03 23:39:00,6138,Valens
358367,SBCregal,2009-07-04 02:36:00,688,valens or mountsberg
358376,jediangler,2009-07-04 02:58:00,1923,You'll see less people at Kelso for sure. There are some nice largemouth in there that nobody targets. There are also perch and other panfish that can be caught with worm and bobber for the kiddies.
358454,I'mHooked,2009-07-04 13:43:00,525,Thanks for the input guys. I hadn't thought of Valens.
358458,jediangler,2009-07-04 13:59:00,1923,"If you are shore fishing at Valens, try right near the dam for pike."
358528,I'mHooked,2009-07-04 19:22:00,525," Awesome JA, thanks for the pointer! Much appreciated.  I'm Hooked"
358548,jediangler,2009-07-04 20:30:00,1923,"There is a derby at Valens next weekend that you and the kid may enjoy. Great draw prizes as well as prizes for biggest bass, pike and panfish in the kids division."
358559,Dara,2009-07-04 21:40:00,3052,Kelso still exists eh.  I remember my dad taking us there to fish speckled trout 45 years ago. I really have no idea where it is either.
358561,jediangler,2009-07-04 22:12:00,1923,At the base of the ski hill west of Milton.You can see it from the 401.
358596,Dara,2009-07-05 00:41:00,3052,I remember we used to park just off the highway and climb down a rock bank and cast out from there. There was a park on the far side that we went to once. I seem to remember a waterwheel mill and stuff. I was only around 7 years old then.
358714,lovetofish,2009-07-05 17:21:00,500,had some very good days at mountsberg by the dam as well.
358723,super dave,2009-07-05 17:42:00,323,Just came back from Mountsberg.  One of the slowest days yet.  Only got into one myself.  The weeds are super thick in there right now.  Hard to get a cast in without coming back with salad.
