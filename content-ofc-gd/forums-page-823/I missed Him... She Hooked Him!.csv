One day during the week-end i sacrifice a day her .  and she decides What we do! :shock:  But i dont argu most of the time we go fishing!  This time she decided to go to our new lake we found last year.  Lest just call it..... Large Mouth Frenzy Every Cast Beast Bucket lake!  We start the day @ 12:00 O clock. :shock:  We brake the ice with many 1 -2 lbs bass .  They were hitting hard.      cast the spinner bait in..... reel two or three times. BANG!    Heres a 3lbs On the dot.  We got LOTS on the weed edges.  The wind was brutal at first then died down @ 5 pm.  You guy suggested a New frog that i had never tried and I LOVE IT!      I Lost a Full houre trying in 3 FOW with lilly pads in sand bottom.  NOTHING!  they were more in 5-6 FOW . Cabage mix with triangle head type weeds.  Still with the frogs.  When the wind died down the frenzy was on.  1-2 pounder were hitting Everywhere.  The technique was you casted IN the cabage.  And as soon as you would get OVER the weed edge where the cabage meets the deep.  BANG! it was INEVITABLE!      MAN this lake is Like my dream come true.  Bass so healthy Just look at them.  Sing of pure health. 8)  Then it Happend.  Steph's turn to shine.......... AND she dosent mess around.  She seriously beat me 2 to 1 on the frogs.  And she pulled the lunker of the day.  A seriouse 4.2 lbs LMB!!!! :shock:      She played this bass like a pro.  Cast in the frog...... wait ...... twitch...twich.... wait....GULP!!!!  1......2......3....... SET THE HOOK!  When it jumped i was screaming like a girl. AHHHHHHHHHHH dont lose this one .  straight in the net and GLORY!!!  The day was ending..... (for me just starting)  Stephanie wanted to leave.......  I tell her i just want to explore one last erea then we leave....  BAD IDEA.  I FOUND ABSOLUTE PARADICE!!!!! :shock:  :shock:  MIles of lillypads MIXED with cabage! :wink:  I put on the black Buzzbait and without a dought.......  Seriously every cast a 2 + bass EVERYTIME!      Now im in MY GLORY!.  Stephanie is giving me '' THE LOOK ''  Rain is starting to kick in..... I KNOW she wants OUT!  i tell her 10 more casts..... THEN TAHTS IT I SWEAR!

356663,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:43:00,2652,Nice fish indeed.  Sorry about the loss of a big fish. Hope your girl's face is ok after taking one near the eye. You did well with the frogs.  I usually go about 1 fish for every 4 blowups.  They can be hard to set on sometimes.

356965,Bassaholic,2009-06-29 23:39:00,74,  I looked all over for this lake and cant find it on any map?!?!?   Great report! Those are some really nice bass. Can't beat big bass busting a frog or a buzzbait. Sucks that you lost that big one but at least you know where it lives now. Keep us posted on return visits.
