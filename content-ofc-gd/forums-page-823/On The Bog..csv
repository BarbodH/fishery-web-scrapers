No money in the budget for a new one right now. It worked pretty good I think, the speed is higher than it was last year. I took out my buddy Scott.  Not the one we know here, Canadian Copper although he should have come, he was texting me all day  . This Scott is One Hundred and Eighty degrees from CC in the fishing department. He is happy to just put a bobber on a line with a worm and kick back. Where as CC is so serious it gets pretty scary at times  .  This is how the day started, Super Ham getting warmed up.    I got the ball rolling back in the proper direction with this one. The next one wasn't to bad either.      The next thing I know there is celebrating from the back of the boat only to see this!    Unfortunately my luck was heading towards the small side 8O , the guy in the back was rubbing off!    The day couldn't get boring with Scott around getting this worked up over bait.      All and all it was a good day out with a good friend. I can't help but think of all the laughing that would be going on if I got both Scott's in the boat at the same time. One would die laughing at the bobber and worm approach and the other would piss himself at the tantrum from a missed hook set."
