He didn't win a prize since they took the 3 largest fish (bass, carp and catfish categories)  but he ended up with a crowd of kids around him trying to figure out his secret technique!  (3 or 4 kids shoulder to shoulder on either side was pretty funny) He had a great time out there and we only got lines tangled with others twice.  I helped out a lot of kids around me with casting and removing a hook or 2 from the few fish that they did manage (the ones that my son haden't gotten to yet!)  If anyone is interested there is a kids derby at Falls Reserve conservation area in Benmiller and at Lake Lisgar in Tillsonburg next weekend.  We won't be able to attend either next weekend.  He's pretty dissapointed since he won the Benmiller derby last year.  Maybe another jr OFC member can take it this year!  jjcanoe"
