At this point the only school that has responded to me with a positive e-mail was Pittsburgh University.  My player is only going into grade 8 but it is never to early to get his name out there. I was wondering if anyone on this Board has contacts down there or if anyone went down there on a scholarship. If so could you please help.  AL"

If HTown is Hog Town which area? Ill direct you to a good program. As far as scholarships univercities in the US are not allowe to talk to students who are not registered with the NCAA clearinghouse. My son is being pursued by a couple differnet schools for a sports scholarship and if you want one you have to send video go visit coaches campuses etc.

358985,Billy Bob,2009-07-06 15:56:00,5865,My son played college football and then coached college football for two years. He would recruit high school players in the off season but was only allowed to talk to seniors because of NCAA recruiting rules so that may be your biggest reason you are not hearing much from US Universities.....
