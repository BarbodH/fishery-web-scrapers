I hope to post more of my summer fishing experiences with this form of fishing...  (maybe even catch something bigger than this from yesterday too...... it hit the top water frog I was using   >>>    Thanks again.  Splashhopper and botbot  PS.. I checked our team entries and we don't have a bass on there yet... so hey, for now at least,  I have finally contributed to adding some inches to the team."
358678,Radnine,2009-07-05 13:38:00,1538,Isn't it funny how territorial frogs are? I have had lots of them attack scum frogs. Cool pictures and congrats on that smallie! Jim
358679,Greencoachdog,2009-07-05 13:40:00,8163,You did good!!!  What did you catch the bass on?... the frog lure as well?
358682,splashhopper,2009-07-05 13:54:00,2931,"Those frogs are very territorial.... two of them came at my top water frog at the same time a few minutes later.... I started tossing the frog about a yard shorter, in the hopes that all their ""natural commotion"" might bring attention to another bass or two..  no such luck  splashhopper"
