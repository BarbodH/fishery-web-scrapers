358768,Rich,2009-07-05 20:30:00,3927,I've tried it a handful of times.. there just aren't a lot of largies there. But there are some.. even decent ones. Don't be fooled by the reeds.. the cuts and boat canals are the best bet.
358805,rbaquial,2009-07-06 00:16:00,968,"I've caught a few Largies in the area before... mostly by the dam.... not many large ones... but when you DO find one, they're of decent size.  "

358822,ld17,2009-07-06 01:35:00,319,"I was just down there fishing the same  stretch of river you talking about and same as you, I tried the reeds and a few docks with no success.  Like rich says I don't think there is a very big population for largies down there."
358823,CLofchik,2009-07-06 01:35:00,854,"From Caledonia down to Cayuga there's decent numbers of smallmouth to be caught from shore or wading, but below Dunnville I've never got more than a handful.  Never seen a largemouth come out of the area.  Too many bigger fish for poor sunfish to compete I think."
358886,rbaquial,2009-07-06 04:52:00,968, LoL! Funny... I JUST realized that!! Hahaha... leave me alone!
358924,smally21,2009-07-06 12:50:00,993,"thanks for the advice.  its interesting how much of the best looking fishing spots dont hold fish.  i dont suppose much of the grand from caledonia to cayuga supports boat traffic.  guess ill stick with lonpoint for the bass - were going today from turkey point for an evening smallmouth/largemouth effort. rumours are the evening topwater bite can be better than the morning, and of course the smallmouth seem to be active almost all day...."
