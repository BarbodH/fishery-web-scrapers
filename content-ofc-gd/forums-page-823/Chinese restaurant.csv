Sure enough there were three Largemouth Bass in the tank with all the other white and putrid looking fish. I think this topic has been on here before but can't seem to find it. Is it not illegal to have Sportfish in a tank like this? Does someone in the city sell them these fish and do they have special licenses to do so? Just curious as to whether this practice is legal or not. "

358800,frozen-fire,2009-07-05 23:53:00,542,yup...just farm raised green bass and tilapia you see in all the tanks at restaurants.
