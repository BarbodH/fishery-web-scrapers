358745,ld17,2009-07-05 19:17:00,319,"Hamilton bay has tons of spots to fish from shore.  You have the channel along bay front both sides.  You have the desjardins cannal.  You have the wall behind the discovery center, all along wiliams coffee pub and cop shop area.  Any place along hidden valley.  Also LaSalle park off water down road.  Any of the boat docks or points and cuts along the bay.  They all produce fish of various species.  You just have to know what you want to catch and use the right bait.   Good luck."
