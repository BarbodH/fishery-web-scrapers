357894,Rich Clemens,2009-07-02 19:40:00,3131,"Hey Pete ... where abouts were ya when you smacked the rock ?  I hit a shoal out in South Muskrat.  I knew it was in the area, but thought it was closer to shore than I was.  Fortunately, I was going fairly slow  and bang, bang, bang ... OH DAMN.    I checked the lower unit and only a few little dings and no real damage done.   (WHEW !!!).  Next time, maybe I'll have the darn thing turned on so I can see where I marked the shoals.  Oh yeah .. great seeing ya again this year."
