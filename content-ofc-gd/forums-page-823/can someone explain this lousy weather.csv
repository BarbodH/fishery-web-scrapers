358794,bow slayer,2009-07-05 23:15:00,1074,"just checked the long range for most of ontario and it is more of the same,lots of wetness next to no sun and heat. Can someone enlighten me as to why? This is July is it not? I thought I heard a weather guy just a few days ago say things should start turning back to normal by Monday,well the forecast says different."
358797,misfish,2009-07-05 23:52:00,29133,"Today was a great day for a nice shore picnic with the mrs,s and a nice sun burn to boot.  Yes it has sucked so far  ,but got to make the best of the best days."
358799,bigugli,2009-07-05 23:52:00,6138,"Just part of the cycle of things.  Wet years balance out the dry ones. Plays as much havoc with crops as a drought does. Makes for some interesting fishing, too."
358801,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-05 23:55:00,947,Well to be honest i kinda like the weather we been having lately in my area.  Only rains for a bit then just over cast perfect for fishing
358808,pikehunter,2009-07-06 00:39:00,1659,"Lousy weather? Be thankful for what we have. Very few days with horrendous humidity, a few days of sun followed by a few days of rain. Sure it's not beach weather but it's been easy on the A/C and the lawn sprinkler too. And how about today? It was beautiful!  Don't forget we had quite a few bad years of drought or near drought conditions and it's about time we started to get some precipitation, otherwise were would the fish swim?  But let's see what this week brings, so far thunderstorms are in Monday's and Tuesday's forecast. So I will wait and see how it pans out before I bring the boat out of the garage."

358813,blarg,2009-07-06 01:06:00,289,Why do you think it's refered to as climate change now.  This is the third summer in a row like this.
358814,Musky or Specks,2009-07-06 01:07:00,2710,Its because you keep having days off. Whenever your working the weather is great. Solution ---keep working let the rest of us enjoy some nice weather.
358816,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-06 01:08:00,2038,The weather soon better change ......  The bass seem to be sluggish so far .
358884,Sawyer,2009-07-06 04:45:00,48,"I think Mother Nature is just doing her weather thing.  Seriously though, rain or shine you should be out there!  -Sawyer"
358895,Billy Bob,2009-07-06 10:49:00,5865," Maybe you're not old enough or don't remember but the same nitwits that are claiming Global warming also predicted Global cooling back in the 70's............everything has it's cycle except to the tree hugging liberals, they are against everything."
358902,Andy,2009-07-06 11:34:00,330,I think it's the Russians. (At least that was what some sorta suggested during the Cold War.) Andy
358907,Beans,2009-07-06 11:51:00,3339, oh ya...I remember that....They were playing their radios too loud !!!
