358945,taper,2009-07-06 14:03:00,611,"I would like to know what the price of Cannon down rigger swivel bases is normally. Any body know off hand, I took a quick look on BP and Cabelas web sites and did not see the style I have. Mine are about a 4 inch square block  single handle on side to allow swivel with four detente positions (I think). Thanks for the help."
358953,Fang,2009-07-06 14:26:00,1330,"I have the older high swivel bases for my Mag 10's and was told they are no longer available. Not totally sure that's the case but the new low profiles have the same hole patterns to accept the older Cannon big body mounting plates. I think they even have the same 4 hole mounting pattern to gon on your boat as the old ones.  LeBarons has the new ones for $99 which is about as cheap as it gets  Fish307.com is where I usually get all my parts, has a bunch of alternate Cannon mounts including some stainless steel which are pricey but cool looking. $87 USD for the swivel at Fish 307"
