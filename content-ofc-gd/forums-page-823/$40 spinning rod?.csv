358227,pikehunter,2009-07-03 16:25:00,1659,"  Well, I want one! Not an old broom handle but an honest to god custom made rod for 40 bucks!   Probably cost 40 bills for the grip alone eh Spiel  I've priced out components before and I understand the cost of parts."
358248,largefish,2009-07-03 17:23:00,35,"Shimano has good rods for a low price. I got 2 Shimano Stimula 7' fast action, medium power rods at Walmart for $20 each. They're pretty versatile, I've even used them for float fishing. So yes, you can get yourself a good rod for under $40. Of course it is not something spectacular, but it does its job well without costing you a fortune and that's all I care about. Why do people here hate Canadian Tire? lol I see many jokes about the name like Cambodian Tire, and others. Canadian Tire has good deals sometimes on different items, so I do go there from time to time after checking the flyer. The store does not look great inside, but hey, who cares, it is not supposed to look like a shopping mall boutique."
358257,Cudz,2009-07-03 17:47:00,2652,Just back from Canadian Tire Barrie.  The North store has some new berkley rods. I think they are called amp or something like that.  Well under $40 and they look really good.
358266,jace,2009-07-03 18:56:00,472,"   I remember those too, along with the famous ads of the rods bent to touch tip to butt.   the magic of fiberglass and very little graphite.  I don't know if the rods still bend like that.  I haven't touched one in 20 years.   It would burn my skin.  haha.    I also remember their lifetime unconditional warranty but somebody mentioned a few years of warranty on them, that's probably one reason they can sell at a lower price now."
358278,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-03 19:50:00,0,"i wouldn't recommend an ugly stick if you have ANY preference towards ""feel"" or ""sensitivity"" because they are neither. if you purely want a rod that won't break then they are the best. for that price i've always purchased berkley rods.  they perform well for a rod in that price range."
358280,danbo,2009-07-03 20:05:00,2646,Shakespeare rods in IM7 are OK.
358590,smally21,2009-07-05 00:28:00,993,"well my rod locker is full of 100$ and up rods but no more!  for spinning rods the shimano stimula and the berkely cherrywood are great rods for the money.  both mimic much more expensive rods like the compre and cumaras that are some of shimano;s best.  both rods are on a clearout at lebaron for around 20$.  im still stuck on the expemsive rods for baitcasting but i see no need for blowing money on spinning rods.  im not  a big fan of the ugly sticks, they have no feel or sensitivity. the stimula and cherrywood both  have sensitive tips but some backbone... just my 2 cents."
358758,Rich,2009-07-05 20:01:00,3927,"Ugly Stik Lite! I can afford the premium rods, but have pretty much switched over to all Ugly Stik Lite. Durable and sensitive!"
358785,JohnF,2009-07-05 21:49:00,3494," Yeah. I got one of 'em a while back and have been trying to figger out what's so awful about it, other than being kinda heavy. Mebbe I'm just not a sensitive kinda guy but I can feel as much with it as I can with any of my supposed-to-be-better rods. I've set it up for my wife to get started in fishing (hadda use it fer sumthin).  JF"
358830,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-06 01:46:00,3761,"I bought bass pros Mega Tournament series spinning rod and reel. Did fine last year and she's still doing good this year. I got the 7'MH rod and it's been out through its paces, drag runs great and the rod handles fine all for the cheep price of $39.99.  MTBF"
358841,GBW,2009-07-06 02:14:00,8460,"I too have 2 of these and for what I do, they are great.  Rod alone, $20, as a combo $50.  I also have 2 Ugly Sticks and they are now sitting in the basement since I got the Shimano Stimula rod's.  Just my 2 cents..."
358956,I'mHooked,2009-07-06 14:37:00,525,"For what it's worth, there is a Zebco combo from CT regular $40 on for $10.  Here's the link: http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...D=1246890835482  I'm sure it's got to be at least worth the $10 bucks."
358965,Jet,2009-07-06 15:14:00,364,For about that price the Daiwa Megaforce rod is a lot of quality for the dollar. Gagnon carries it as do several local shops but I did not see it as BPS.  http://www.daiwafreshwaterfishingrods.com/megaforce%AE.htm
357902,aws,2009-07-02 20:03:00,53,
357907,K_F,2009-07-02 20:13:00,107,i was able to get a heavy action rapala magnum at the spring fishing show for 40$ cash....seems like a decent rod......I know that line is prices fairly reasonably
357908,tinbanger,2009-07-02 20:16:00,1028,"I have an older Michell 2 pc combo that has caught alot of fish ( perch to pike)been bounced around,dropped ,etc Think I MIGHT have paid $40 but that was 10 year ago. watch for sales . TB"
357910,timmeh,2009-07-02 20:22:00,609,If you're worried about durability the ugly stick lite at canadian tire is around that price. I used one when i started getting into fishing and they're good for the $. Don't think you could break the thing without trying.
357918,NAW,2009-07-02 20:41:00,4022,I second the Ugly Stick.  Never used a Ugly Stick Lite.  I have one of the heavier ones.  Great rod for the $30 I paid for it (on sale and BPS).
357919,tinbanger,2009-07-02 20:43:00,1028,"If you want durable Ugly stik is the way to go , find them real whippy though .  tb"
357928,jace,2009-07-02 21:06:00,472,"  whippy because theres a lot of fiberglass in them.   the glass is also what makes them tough like big trolling rods, and so heavy.   They're not the most sensitive sticks due to the weight and materials but they're perfect for the casual fisherman or anybody who doens't want to spend a lot on a rod that'll last a while."
357931,MillerPhoto,2009-07-02 21:11:00,147,  They also have like a 3 or 5 year warranty on them also! I was lookin at one last week.
357932,camillj,2009-07-02 21:13:00,1988,I have a half a dozen various length/style Ugly sticks ... love them all ... I even have a little 3' ice fishing ugly stick ... and have broken /replaced many more (much more) expensive rods ... but the old faithful is definitely the ugly stick ... and at around $40 for a 7' rod its great value  They used to be about double that price range ...
357944,Burning Babies,2009-07-02 21:59:00,150,"I find Ugly Sticks have the sensitivity of a wet noodle.  I avoid them like the plague.  I'm not that familiar with the market in Canada, but $50 seems like the price point for a decent IM6 or IM7 rod around here, with $40 very dooable during a sale.  The Bass Pro Shops Tourney Specials start there, and are a major step up from their graphite series."
357947,pike slayer,2009-07-02 22:06:00,1177,"ya i cant stand the feel of the ugly sticks, i say if you want a decent all around rod get the shimano sojourn at crappy for $39.99. the tip is sensitive but it still has back bone to take on a big fish. thats what i use for an all around rod."
357956,EC1,2009-07-02 22:22:00,930,"I'd say go for the lower end berkley or rapala rods. (Berkley Lightning Rods / Rapala Magnum / Berkley Tactix)  Those have much better sensitivity and are lighter. You won't be sad if one of these break, and they don't break too easily."
357965,archie_james_c,2009-07-02 22:31:00,618,"The Shimano Sojourn gets my vote. It's 39.99$ at Cambodian Tire. The rods a cork handled, 6'6"" Medium power Fast action. It has a great bend to it, balances well and has alot of backbone for stiff hook sets   ."
357997,Cudz,2009-07-03 00:09:00,2652,"I am going to have to give the old 2 thumbs down to the ugly stick.  But if you want an unsensitive heavy basic rod that probably won't break, go for it.  If you want something that is more sensitive and lighter, and made with better components, DO NOT BUY I got two $20 rods that are head and shoulders better thatn an ugly stick in almost any situation.  They are IM6 graphite 7' m action with fast tip with 9 good quality fuji guides and split rear handle cork grip.  You just have to find the sales.  I know there wre a few recent 7' combo sales (rod and reel) half price.  Total cost $40 and one was an IM7 graphite rod with titanium guides.  If all else fails buy a 6'6"" or 7' lightning rod.  I have one. It is not bad, I rarely use it but it works."
358016,jace,2009-07-03 00:41:00,472,"  Probably fuji alconite or hardloy with stainless frames.   There's absolutely no chance fuji titanium's would be used on a $40 (full price) rod.   Just one fuji titanium spinning guide size 30 (typical first large guide) alone is $40.   Still, any rod that uses fuji alconite or hardloy's is a good deal for $20."
358070,archie_james_c,2009-07-03 02:44:00,618,  Agreed!!!
358080,Canuck2fan,2009-07-03 03:06:00,1444,Find a store that sells Pflueger Trion Rods and you can get a good High Modulus Graphite rod for under 40 bucks. I just bought a lite action 6.5ft for perch fishing for 30 bucks and it is GREAT. I also caught 31 sheephead in a row last Tuesday night on it a few of which were well over 10 lbs. It handled it all with ease.
358093,Cudz,2009-07-03 04:02:00,2652,Maybe my post is not clear.  My rod with 9 eyes on it has fuji alconite.  My friend recently got a rod with titanium eyes for $40 and that rod came with a reel.  Those titanium eyes WERE NOT Fuji.  My lightning rod has titanium coated alloy guides.
358139,Spiel,2009-07-03 11:43:00,9065,"First off the thing to do would be to talk to someone at BPS, they're usually pretty good about waranties on their product lines.  After that, well I could build you a rod for $40.00, indestuctable but like the ""Ugly Stick"" you would enjoy using it."
358142,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-03 11:51:00,1022,"If your a rod breaker, like me   , save the extra money and buy a rod that has lifetime warranty. Its the best money you will spend. I have got my moneys worth thats for sure, as I broke a shimano compre and a st croix avid. My recommendation: compre! Sooner or later you will catch the disease and desire expensive gear."
358147,pikehunter,2009-07-03 12:04:00,1659," Tough to beat Spiel's offer. Other than that I can vouch for the Ugly Stick ""Lite"" I have this in a 6'6"" and not a problem with it, notice the quotes on lite. I haven't tried a regular Ugly, only the lite, good Walleye and perch rod. It is a couple bucks more than the  regular one.  Does anyone else remember the early Ugly Sticks? Back in the 70's when they sold for around 90 - a hundred bucks! Big money in 1970's dollars.  Drop Spiel a PM."
358154,Spiel,2009-07-03 12:30:00,9065, My offer was totally tongue in cheek. For $40.00 I'd be building it on a old broom handle.
358156,johnnyb,2009-07-03 12:33:00,3413,"Canadian tire just had a great little Abu Garcia Combo for $29.99 last week...leaves you $$ to spool it with quality line, too!  Tons of options for $40 out there...just go to LeBaron, or CTC, or BPS, grab a few rods and shake 'em around 'till you find one you like.  And just bring your $40...no plastic....easy way to stay in budget"
358175,backbay,2009-07-03 13:32:00,773,"Another vote for the Plueger Trion. IM8 blank for $40 is a pretty good deal. I have a 6 1/2' one, and use it a fair amount. It's senstive, has decent backbone, and is fun to fish with."
358178,FLEX ROD,2009-07-03 13:42:00,394,"The Ugly Stick is okay and they do last, I have one also from the 70's then it was a good buy, I would look at Cabela's own brand rods, in my oppion the best bang for your buck and great warranty you can not beat them, and I do not think that Bass Pro can not come close.
