358569,bigugli,2009-07-04 22:43:00,6138,"Not on it . Don't want to be bothered with so -called school friends who could not otherwise bother with keeping ties.  As for the employment issues, companies take several different approaches. To date I know of two individuals stupid enough to incriminate themselves on facebook and get fired. It's as simple as calling in sick but plastering party pics that night.  To quote another policy: ""At no time are the affairs of _____  and it's affiliates, its employees , agents, etc..., to be made a subject of public scrutiny. All violations will be subject to immediate dismissal""."

358722,Rich,2009-07-05 17:42:00,3927,"The majority of my pictures are posted on there.. no PG 13 restrictions and no worries about lurkers, lol."
358771,sticky,2009-07-05 20:39:00,33,I'm on there.  Apparently if you google Chris Stickle it shows up right there.
358404,bigfish1965,2009-07-04 06:33:00,3382,Do you have an FB profile?

358421,Bernie,2009-07-04 11:22:00,3190,"Not so much through the summer months but the long winter nights it's interesting. We have a local group where we post pictures and stories of my home town. There are close to a thousand  pictures there now. Great way to keep in touch with old school mates. Looked at Twitter for a bit, found it boring."
358426,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-07-04 11:42:00,115,"I'm on there, but rarely check it out. once in awhile when i'm bored. you can find me under my board name.."

358449,Lowe Rider,2009-07-04 13:10:00,79,"Yep, it's a cheap way to keep in touch with relatives all over North America. Friends here in T O  as well."
358471,charlied,2009-07-04 15:06:00,584,i am there to....good to keep in touch with friends from years ago.  Just watch what you put on there.  Employers are searching the site to nail there employees or future employees.
358475,johnnyb,2009-07-04 15:14:00,3413,"Yup -- I'm on it...was cool to catch up with people from the past...now I pretty much post photos, videos and exchange smart remarks with a few friends and family.  And of COURSE I'm on the OFC page"
358477,Lowe Rider,2009-07-04 15:17:00,79,"  Just lock down your privacy settings for friends only, but I'm sure there are ways around that. I have my mom on there  plus I'm too boring to have anything incriminating to worry about.  :D"
358481,bigfish1965,2009-07-04 15:33:00,3382, Their coding is pretty tight. The only real loophole in the permissions is through the photo albums. If you disallow comments on photos you are as secure as can be. Most of the people I work with are on it and only one person got into any trouble..he doctored images of the corporate president and posted them in a not very flattering way...but our big bosses ignore it. I have had meetings with them about all the social networking stuff and it became policy they would leave it so that employees could vent or not feel watched over.  There is a reason I am asking which will become apparent as time goes by.
358487,ciceri,2009-07-04 15:47:00,535,"Yeah, I'm on there"
358491,Twocoda,2009-07-04 16:08:00,4130,yep ive been on it since the beginning....family is all over the continent so it keeps us in touch on a day to day basis....
358498,kickingfrog,2009-07-04 16:35:00,8333,"I am on there. Don't use it as much as in the beginning, but still handy to keep distant friends and family in the loop."
358505,Mattones,2009-07-04 17:18:00,587,Im am on there I just joined the OFC group!
358514,l2p,2009-07-04 18:05:00,346,^^ same here! alot of fishyporn off the OFC group page
358523,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-04 19:02:00,0,"crackbook is good.  i've actually gotten to know some of my more distant family with it, keep in touch with peeps, and it gives me an easy place to dump fish pics for the boys to see."
358535,Bob,2009-07-04 19:47:00,370,I'm on it but don't use it a whole lot.  Listed as Karaoke Bob on there.  myfamily.com is where the family stays in touch.
358541,Rich Clemens,2009-07-04 20:09:00,3131,"  Having never been on Facebook, I signed up to check it out. So, how do you get to this ""group"" ?  EDIT:  DUH.   I think I found it."
358545,richyb,2009-07-04 20:23:00,774,"im on facebook , that fish wrangler game is addictive ."
358553,Lowe Rider,2009-07-04 21:04:00,79, That's good to know.  Now why would someone doctor a picture of their boss and put it on Facebook. Sounds like a pretty dumb move to me.
