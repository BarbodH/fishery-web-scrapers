I looked at the Cannon rail mount but a bit skeptical if the railing will hold the 15lb weight with two lines. Anyone you guys know with metal fabrication skills who's done this before? I know I can google metal fabricators, but would like to contact someone who's done this before. Appreciate the guidance or contacts. Thanks"
