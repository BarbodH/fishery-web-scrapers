1073365,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-18 23:01:00,826,"Awesome !! Thanks for the tips guys really appreciate it, Hope to have it in the Driveway this week !"
1073390,tomkat,2021-05-19 16:01:00,246,You will love it. I have Yamaha 50 tiller. With the friction adjustment and the throttle lock I find it much easier and more comfortable than my 2 previous boats with steering wheels. The large tiller arm gives great leverage. 
1073470,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-20 20:56:00,826,She’s home !!!! Lots of studying to do with regards to the electronics and Trolling motor loL gotta fab up a duck blind over the summer and it’s good to go ! again thanks for the tiller tips !   
1073471,aplumma,2021-05-20 21:24:00,6896,Very cool lots of people are getting new toys. Art
1073472,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-20 21:30:00,826,That’s a pretty sweet rig !!!!
1073474,misfish,2021-05-20 21:39:00,29133,Sweet rig buddy. Lots of floor space for the kids to run around .
1073482,tomkat,2021-05-21 00:45:00,246,G3 makes a nice boat. Looks like great storage and lots of floor space!
1073490,lew,2021-05-21 06:39:00,12766,Real nice set-up & you'll love that Yamaha. Fun times ahead !!
1073711,saltydog,2021-05-31 16:13:00,3,I have a 90 hp tiller and I love it.  Just keep the motor adjusted to your comfort level for steering and as was said earlier don't keep it too loose.  For some reason I like the tiller steering plus more space for all my friends that want to go fishing.
1073268,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-15 18:03:00,826,"Hey guys , Pulled the trigger and purchased a 177 G3 Outfitter , 70hp Yamaha tiller . Any tips for a operating a Larger tiller ?   	Thanks"
1073269,misfish,2021-05-15 18:19:00,29133,Not here buddy. I am happy with a 30lb tiller now.LOL  Sounds like a sweet ride. Pic ?
1073273,OhioFisherman,2021-05-15 19:02:00,6623,https://www.g3boats.com/outfitter-v177-t-2/
1073274,dave524,2021-05-15 19:17:00,4508,LOL 
1073276,bushart,2021-05-15 20:17:00,2628,Just watch your trim to keep the nose down---sitting in the back sometimes can be a challenge for obstructions or kayakers 🙂 passengers a lot of times don't get that you need to see also- I run a 50 tiller
1073277,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-15 20:42:00,826,"LOL pick her up this week , got some rigging to do then ill snap a pic ,  gotta fab a duck blind for it over the summer though."
1073278,Rustic-Fisher,2021-05-15 20:44:00,826,"Great tip , thanks ! "
1073279,misfish,2021-05-15 20:58:00,29133,Howdy Terrance. Nice to see ya around.
1073280,bushart,2021-05-15 21:20:00,2628,Hey Bri---keepin them lines tight?
1073286,Beans,2021-05-16 01:52:00,3339,Where's Roy when we need him ?...He was a tiller man if'n I remember right !
1073288,John,2021-05-16 11:55:00,2956,"PM Spiel, he has a large tiller on his Lund."
1073294,Fisherman,2021-05-16 14:39:00,7201,"Make sure the friction device is not too loose, all of a sudden if you let go you will go for a loop."
1073295,misfish,2021-05-16 15:34:00,29133,"Yup,done that myself. And it was only a 25 hp going warp speed.LOL"
1073296,Sinker,2021-05-16 15:37:00,8692,No steering assist on the 70? You won't notice any difference from any other tiller really. That's a sweet boat too. You will love that rig. So much more versatile than a jon boat. S.
1073299,Sinker,2021-05-16 15:44:00,8692,"Get some quality light rain gear/bibs, you will get wet. Also, a pair of goggles for the cold/snowy/rainy days duck hunting. You will thank me later. I have ran a tiller my whole life. S."
1073304,Steve Piggott,2021-05-16 17:25:00,196,The face saver is great for the tiller. After 30 mph your eyes start to water. Great on cold days 
1073310,sauce,2021-05-17 00:24:00,219,"I find the direction my body is facing makes a difference.  Trolling, my body is facing the side of the boat. I turn my head to view my course.  On plane, my body is facing my course.  Running chop with your head turned 90 degrees is not fun. Surprised no one has suggested this one.... Any time above trolling speed you really should be tethered to the kill switch."
1073311,Fisherman,2021-05-17 00:54:00,7201,Ski masks work well too.
1073316,Sinker,2021-05-17 03:00:00,8692,So does thick skin 😎😎
1073318,DanD,2021-05-17 10:41:00,2223,"Along with Fisherman's suggestion. If there is a pull left or right on the tiller, while at speed; you can easily adjust that out. The vid is of a merc but the idea is the same. "
1073328,AKRISONER,2021-05-17 14:27:00,5558,now you are just making me feel bad for my passengers in my single console bass boat 🤣
1073333,DanD,2021-05-17 16:11:00,2223,Luke! I’m your father. Sorry couldn’t resist. LOL Dan.
1073336,misfish,2021-05-17 18:11:00,29133,Just amazing how my mudder felt when I took her for a ride in mine. LOL. She did take off her glasses before blasting off.LOL She loved it. She always enjoyed the craziest and fasted rides at the amusement  parks.
1073337,AKRISONER,2021-05-17 18:17:00,5558,"i finally got my 66 year old mom out in the skeeter last spring. She held on tight but loved it. My father hates riding in my boat and this year he hasnt put his boat in yet so hes been doing a lot of riding in it. It also hasnt been particularly warm. 2 weeks ago he asked if we could ""cruise"" back so that he would be warmer lol"
1073339,lew,2021-05-17 18:33:00,12766,"For years my brother always had a 14' tinny & then 20 odd years ago I bought a Crestliner with a side console.  He used to fish with me all the time and one cold rainy day down at Quinte we were running down the lake and I was warm & dry behind the windshield while he looked like a drowned duck. He looked over at me and asked ""why the heck didn't you buy a boat with a windshield for me too and I said ""because you didn't offer to pay for 1/2 the new boat"" He didn't laff but I thought it was hilarious  LOL 😁"
