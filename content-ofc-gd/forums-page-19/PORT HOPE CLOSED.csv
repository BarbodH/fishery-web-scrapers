1073343,LefroyFisherman,2021-05-17 20:29:00,602,"I kinda agree with that, but what if there is no Walmart or Costco in your local area? I don’t see people getting asked where they live when shopping. Your fishing outside for gods sake. My launches on simcoe are currently closed, so if I wanted to fish local I can’t lol. Hopefully very soon."
1071933,chessy,2021-04-09 18:13:00,610,Port hope has or will close all municipal access to river till may 6   (GANARASKA RIVER ) INCLUDING BOAT LAUNCH
1071937,Spiel,2021-04-09 22:47:00,9065,Ridiculous! Insanity rules apparently.
1071938,porkpie,2021-04-09 22:50:00,2521,Just port hope being port hope.  They’d fill the river in with cement if they could.
1071939,Spiel,2021-04-09 23:04:00,9065,"It's not just Port Hope, it's going province wide rapidly! "
1071941,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-09 23:37:00,602,"Insanity is right, had enough of this crap to be honest... they blocked off a public launch in Dunnville too. But by all means go ahead and have 100 flights land from all over the world every week in Ontario."
1071942,LostAnotherOne,2021-04-10 01:44:00,956,Thanks for the update
1071945,porkpie,2021-04-10 03:40:00,2521,"They couldn’t beat me last spring brother, they won’t beat me this spring.  I made a small trailer out of bike tires so I could strap the back end of my tinny to it and wheel right past the closed launches and  down the bank.  That, and with marinas specifically named as being allowed to operate (including launches) I’ll be fishing one way or the other!"
1071947,Garnet,2021-04-10 12:14:00,2056,And Durham Region said come fish here. We will take your money.
1071948,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-10 12:18:00,602,"For anyone that does or did the Orillia Perch Fest. It was to be virtual this year starting soon, where you catch a perch in any lake or river in Simcoe county and take a picture of it and submit it. They have postponed it til after this stay at home or whatever buzz word they are calling it now."
1071950,Rustic-Fisher,2021-04-10 13:21:00,826,"It makes no sense and is ridiculous . I'm a 10 min drive to the Ganny , on this drive i pass 3 golf courses ,parking lots full. Was the closure designed to limit people region hoping ? likely, does that mean the golf courses are only allowing municipality residents ? In our house its my son that suffers the most from this decision , at age 11 with all sports cancelled and living rural the kid loved fishing the river 2-3 times a week , and was looking forward to launching the boat for some crappies this week. Its what he looks forward to all week. Rant over LOL, its my first one during this pandemic. Now to tell him the bad news . "
1071951,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-10 13:30:00,602,"Yep, none!! Of this makes any sense, I golfed last weekend with 3 guys not from my household, we stayed apart as much as we could. How come ski hills weren’t allowed when golfing is? All the double standards and the flip flopping every other day on stuff has made me lose whatever faith I did have in the government as a whole. The rest of the world will be moving on and we will all be in our 8th stay at home lockdown shutdown emergency brake 11th wave."
1071952,Sinker,2021-04-10 14:12:00,8692,"Just go man. Drive to the launch, and go. If its closed, drive to the next one.  There will be somewhere to drop your boat in, and you aren't hurting anyone or yourself. I'm sick of the crap too, and I will be going no matter what. Give me my fine, have a nice day, see you in court. S."
1071953,dave524,2021-04-10 14:29:00,4508,"From my memory, once the season opens the better fishing is upstream from the mouth area, we always fished above the 401 , especially in the Canton area staying away from the zoo at Sylvan Glenn. Sucks if you want to boat but shouldn't effect river fishermen."
1071954,LostAnotherOne,2021-04-10 17:44:00,956,"Well after a few calls I found a launch that's open.  I love my cats in the spring, but dink pike tomorrow it is. "
1071958,irishfield,2021-04-10 19:19:00,26272,Penetang's launch is open...
1071959,misfish,2021-04-10 19:25:00,29133,"So are my river access spots. I will be near ya in the AM, but ya, I know,no visitors."
1071960,BillM,2021-04-10 20:27:00,17367,Lots of ramps open.    Go see how many boats are off Jordan/Grimsby today
1072309,msp,2021-04-20 14:35:00,1336,$ 150 to have the entire Ganny to yourself on opener is a pretty sweet deal if you ask me.
1073110,Costlesscatchmore,2021-05-08 20:06:00,10,12 ft tinner will get you in no need for a boat launch if you have a friend
1073121,Rizzo,2021-05-09 12:25:00,4754,...except you are not allowed to be with a friend
1073123,Sinker,2021-05-09 13:38:00,8692,You are if someone is a single person living alone. Just go!  S.
1073221,Salmon Catcher,2021-05-12 17:27:00,15,Provincially we have experienced businessman Ford running it. Much better then liberal horse face woman before.  Federally is different story. Get off your butt and vote Socialists and Marxists out. All they bring is misery not prosperity.

1073332,LefroyFisherman,2021-05-17 15:55:00,602,That’s insane...
1073342,misfish,2021-05-17 20:21:00,29133,"Well my friend,I have to agree with this . Fish your local area,keep local . I am staying with in my area for all my fishing . Just the way I am doing my part . I am happy that I am getting out ."
