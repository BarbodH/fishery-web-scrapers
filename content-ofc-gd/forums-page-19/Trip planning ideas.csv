Having never spent any time seeing the Georgian Bay area before, we are planning to spend a day going up the 400 to Sudbury before staying the night & doing Sudbury to cochrane the next day. Just wondering if there's any scenic/worthwhile spots along the way worth stopping & checking out. Also any spots where me and my son can stop and toss a line from shore for a few minuteshere & there? Any & all suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Feel free to PM me if you prefer."
1073260,scuro2,2021-05-15 12:32:00,904,If you are going that way consider a ferry across to Manitoulin.
1073285,fishdawg,2021-05-16 01:51:00,912,Won't work on this trip.. another time Thanks for the suggestion
1073287,Bill,2021-05-16 10:02:00,140,All along Georgian Bay is very scenic. You will not be disappointed. 
1073422,Hack_Fisherman,2021-05-19 22:23:00,720," A scenic stop but a bit of a hike is Killarney provincial park. George lake on the interior side or a short hike to the Georgian bay side. Pay access though. Fishing....not so much, or at least for my hack ways. if you’re travelling with a canoe or inflatable, the Wanapeti river (on the Killarney road) is an easy paddle. You can paddle all the way up to the ghost town of Burwash and see the abandoned jail."
1073444,pics,2021-05-20 03:33:00,1268,Personally I would save the side trip for another time.  If you are going on a fly-in trip you want your cold and frozen stuff to stay that way as long as possible.  Cochrane isn't too bad for a one day trip. We pass through it on our way to the Nipigon.. we don't have to worry too much about thawing..
1073486,acplumber,2021-05-21 01:59:00,28,I agree with pics. But if you need it take a trip down hwy60 through Algonquin and try to see a moose
1073487,Hack_Fisherman,2021-05-21 02:40:00,720,I hear spring melt is best time for moose spotting. Beautiful drive.
1073500,BillM,2021-05-21 13:42:00,17367,It's not very scenic up the 400 much past the Waub to be honest.   Once you get past PAB you could always stop at the Key or French river for a little break and some views.
