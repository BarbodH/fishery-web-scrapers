We'd like to find a remote airport with a nearby awesome lake, where there existed an outfitter or marina who could rent us a boat and give us a ride back and forth???.... We're happy to pay even a premium! Any help would be appreciated!! Thanks Sheldon"
1073496,irishfield,2021-05-21 13:00:00,26272,Good luck on wheels if you want to truly go North. All depends what kind of adventure you want and an aerodromes/airports of Ontario map would be a good planning start..

1073520,pics,2021-05-22 11:37:00,1268,That sounds doable but all you will save is time driving up there.. now if the plane had floats that would be a different story..
