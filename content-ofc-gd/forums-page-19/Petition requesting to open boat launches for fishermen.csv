1073072,Crimsongulf,2021-05-07 19:51:00,294,I only monitor KFLA and the lockdown has had minimal effect on their numbers.  They still have high number and actually they have gone up a fair amount in the last week. https://www.kflaph.ca/en/healthy-living/status-of-cases-in-kfla.aspx
1073078,BillM,2021-05-07 20:44:00,17367,"Fished Lake O yesterday, zero issues.    Not a bad day on the water."
1073080,Crimsongulf,2021-05-07 21:27:00,294,"Well, did you go fishin or catchin? "
1073081,LefroyFisherman,2021-05-07 21:53:00,602,"If they wanted me to wear a friggin mask golfing, I would have. Ridiculous. Outdoors - Safe!"
1073082,LefroyFisherman,2021-05-07 21:55:00,602,I really doubt the lockdowns or whatever buzz word they want too call it is lifted the Friday before May 24 weekend.
1073084,scuro2,2021-05-07 23:09:00,904,"Those pandemics are kinda of unwieldy things, if you could just will it to be over it would just be an outbreak. Encourage everyone to get the jab, that is the quickest way it will be over."
1073085,Crimsongulf,2021-05-07 23:24:00,294,Is vaccine supply getting better?
1073088,Dara,2021-05-08 00:16:00,3052,No kiddin. I have an appointment opening day of walleye season. Guess what I'm doing that day.
1073091,scuro2,2021-05-08 02:50:00,904,This is when Canada contracted for the bulk of their vaccinations. Pretty well everyone who wants a shot will get it by the end of June. Second shots will go till the end of summer.
1073093,pics,2021-05-08 03:35:00,1268,I am hearing that the lockdown will be extended until June 2nd.. I hope I'm hearing wrong
1073097,ch312,2021-05-08 14:43:00,1590,"Most of these people wearing masks alone while in cars are delivery drivers working for Uber and Skip the Dishes type employers. They will lose their incomes if customers complain, so they wear their masks full time to avoid forgetting it. Then there's the small clueless percentage who think doing so will somehow help. Mesh see through masks are a great thing for those who aren't exactly on board with wearing masks....   I really don't understand why it's okay to take my family to stand in a crowded area to get ice cream and then go play at a park with dirty kids snotting, coughing, sneezing and touching everything. But, I cannot go by myself to a boat launch and spend the day in the middle of a lake literally kilometers from anyone? Petitions are mostly useless, but I signed anyways."
1073174,aplumma,2021-05-10 22:17:00,6896,Sorry another thread ruined by our covid cowboys who will not leave it alone. I am going to start modding accounts. I am tired of the reports on people belittling others and spreading half truths on this subject. Take it to P.M. or off the site. thanks Art

1072992,vance,2021-05-05 14:38:00,719,Done and sent to 5 other people..
1073012,Dara,2021-05-05 23:36:00,3052,"If he didn't suggest checking for a license at the launch I would sign it. And maybe fish with the people you live with, not just limit randoms to 2. We are distancing right now, not picking best fishing partners. I just want to launch with my dog and go fish a bit I am in a low risk community and our municipal launch is barricaded while I hear you guys in Hamilton etc hot zones saying launches are open"
1073014,wkrp,2021-05-06 02:52:00,656,I think that the golf community will prevail over the fisher communiy
1073017,AKRISONER,2021-05-06 12:53:00,5558,"Follow the money lol theres only two weeks left, they aren’t going to change course over 14 days."
1073018,lew,2021-05-06 13:12:00,12766,I think Ford said yesterday there wouldn't be any further changed to the current restrictions and everything stays as is for now.
1073019,scuro2,2021-05-06 13:35:00,904,What should have been the maximum restriction was that you can only fish or golf alone. Many would be happy with that.
1073020,AKRISONER,2021-05-06 13:49:00,5558,"operationally I dont think it would make financial sense for golf courses to operate at 1/4 capacity. fishing however is on your own dime. By the way, fishing isnt illegal right now, its just hard to find a launch thats open. As usual, people would rather complain then actually put the effort in to make it happen. Typically these same people are the ones that are only complaining because they cant go fishing with all of their buddies. Ive been out fishing, and many people I know have as well."
1073024,LostAnotherOne,2021-05-06 14:36:00,956,With my usual spring time launches now closed I have found 2 that are better maintained and a little cheaper.
1073027,scuro2,2021-05-06 17:32:00,904,"I dunno, say a few courses don't open. Imagine the demand for the courses that were open, you could fill every slot 7 days a week. I know that pretty well happens on some courses but for other courses singles all day long 7 x a week may actually bring in more money."
1073028,AKRISONER,2021-05-06 18:37:00,5558,"I’ll tell you right now, the noise surrounding the lockdown has died totally down aside from the weirdos at “no more lockdowns” there’s no way dougie or any of his crew are going to make noise at this point. They are going to let these next what 13? Days pass and point to the fact that once again (as we already knew) tight lockdowns are extremely effective at reducing case and hospitalization numbers. In two weeks my assumption is that we will probably be a lot closer to 1000 cases per day with no doubt a decline in the volume in the ICU’s to be on topic, this petition is a month late and won’t have any impact on the current lockdown we are in. You’d have to be crazy to think that anyone involved with the decision to close local boat ramps is going to do a total 180 on the subject. As with most things it’s easier to just shut it totally down then try and police who’s going fishing vs who’s going fishing with their buddies from 5 different households etc. Or who’s going “fishing” but actually going to have a boat party and get drunk with some girls on their dad’s cabin cruiser. the entire premise that “carrying a fishing rod and having a fishing license” is grounds for you to go boating is hilarious. Funny how easy carrying a fishing pole and having a fishing license turns into what I described above. once again and I will reiterate. If you want to go fishing, it’s easily done. Those that care enough to go have been and will continue to be out on the water and laying into some fish.  "

1073033,chessy,2021-05-06 20:30:00,610,port hope lifting the lock down friday.. so launch will be open and so will municipal access to the river 
1073034,Terry,2021-05-06 20:48:00,14456,"I think they are not separating marinas from     boat launches. Many people think of a marina as 100s of boats all parked close together and people using them as cottages, living close to one another bbqing on the dock beside everyone else  and that isn’t good at this time but a boat ramp.  Boat in and out  not close contact should be good to go"
1073037,scuro2,2021-05-06 21:25:00,904,The figure I heard was 10 x less likely and those catch it are in close proximity say 2-3 ft away 
1073038,AKRISONER,2021-05-06 21:54:00,5558,i think port hope wanted to mainly get through the complete gonshow that is ontario trout opener.
1073039,Terry,2021-05-06 22:23:00,14456,On ctv news Barrie the grey bruce medical officer say almost exactly what I wrote and he is opening boat ramps in his area but not marinas
1073041,Dara,2021-05-06 22:39:00,3052,The variants have learned to jump further...mask at 10 feet keeps you mostly safe
1073043,Rizzo,2021-05-07 01:05:00,4754,"I think you were trying to be funny...either way, made me laugh!"
1073045,scuro2,2021-05-07 10:19:00,904,Well you're going to look preetty odd at the kid's outdoor birthday party this summer as you keep your 10 foot bubble quaking from the variants.
1073046,Rizzo,2021-05-07 12:04:00,4754,Personally I am getting used to seeing odd things. I used to laugh when I would see people driving alone in their car with a mask on...now I almost expect it.
1073057,Dara,2021-05-07 16:06:00,3052,somewhat funny but also a bit serious. The only way we beat this is to not pass it on I'm not allowed to go to my only grand daughters second birthday without quaranteening 14 days And I don't want to spend 2 days in airports either. we need this to be over
1073058,dave524,2021-05-07 16:12:00,4508,"My observation is that a lot of the closing is at the discretion of local governments ,  Conservation Authorities and parks depts. One jurisdiction the public ones are open and next door barricaded."
1073068,Rizzo,2021-05-07 19:32:00,4754,do you mean because she lives in the states?
1073069,Terry,2021-05-07 19:42:00,14456,Some eastern provinces are making people quarantine coming from other provinces
