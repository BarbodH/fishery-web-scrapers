1073263,Terry,2021-05-15 16:03:00,14456,Nice ride.     How were the bugs today.  Yesterday they were nasty
1073264,porkpie,2021-05-15 16:33:00,2521,Nice ride pal!  We had coffee on the boat this morning!  You should bring that sucker for a float down the grand! 
1073265,misfish,2021-05-15 16:46:00,29133,"The hatch started around 9. It was fast and furious. Shinners were picking them off the surface. I watched as the hatch was laying on the surface, then take off,That was cool . I would love to do that,but need to have a lift back up the riv to the truck . I had 2 x tra large this morning too. Pissed like a race horse all morning.LOL"
1073270,porkpie,2021-05-15 18:35:00,2521,LOL I have an inflatable.  Maybe do a fall drift!
1073284,AKRISONER,2021-05-16 01:17:00,5558,Bugs here stayed close to the water and didn’t fly high. Different story in the Bush or near the beach. The black flies are hatched and chewing. Luckily so were the Laketrout. Had 3 in 3 casts at one point. Caught a bunch more too. Panoptix putting on a clinic. Didnt even have to get up with the Sun. They ate all afternoon. thanks for the recap
1073298,Sinker,2021-05-16 15:42:00,8692,nice to see your getting out. Where the feeesh? S.
1073330,mamona,2021-05-17 14:42:00,597,You are so well prepared  You picked perfect day to go out.
1073619,Snidley,2021-05-26 15:37:00,620,"This is NOT my boat and I don't know the guy but I had the same make of Foldcat boat but the smaller 2 seat version. They are great well made boats for the money. This guy has modified the 4 seater to a, better laid out, 2 seater and if I had somewhere to put the thing i would buy it.  I have a Hobie Floatcat rowboat. It's great for me because I can store my Hobbie Floatcat  indoors and  I carry it on the top of my Volkswagon. The Hobie is about 55lb, this thing would weigh more. I did sell my 2 seat Foldcat to a guy who picked it up in a Chevy Volt. Believe it or not the 2 seat Foldcat fit perfectly in the Volt, which is a VERY small car, albeit a hatchback. https://www.kijiji.ca/v-personal-watercraft/muskoka/4-man-foldcat-440-inflatable-pontoon-boat/156830 I saw a guy on Kijiji that had an Outcast rowable, inflatable kayak that I wanted to buy but we could not agree on a price. That boat looks like the Outcast and looks good. How does it row?:"
1073621,Snidley,2021-05-26 15:42:00,620,Too late. Looks like the guy on Kiji sold his custom Foldcat 440 so the link no longer works. Here's the one I had from Sea Eagle's own website 4 man Foldcat 440 inflatable pontoon boat | Personal Watercraft | Muskoka | Kijiji
1073698,misfish,2021-05-29 17:18:00,29133,It is the OutCast .It rows very easy and stays straight easy. No drag at all  .
