1073497,captpierre,2021-05-21 13:13:00,2521,Anybody know anything about the health of the Scugog walleye population since the fishery was closed?
1073511,GBW,2021-05-21 21:42:00,8460,"I have not heard a thing, not even accidentally caught posts or PM's from friends/folks in the area while crappie or perch fishing."
1073548,captpierre,2021-05-23 15:11:00,2521,"The walleye fishery has been closed for a while now. I hope the population is recovering.  If not, are they stocking?"
1073628,Rizzo,2021-05-26 18:10:00,4754,I was there musky fishing a year ago and happened into a 6 lber and a 7 lber. So strap on a big musky lure and see what happens!
1073629,captpierre,2021-05-26 18:13:00,2521,Good sign. Not a good indicator of recruitment though.
