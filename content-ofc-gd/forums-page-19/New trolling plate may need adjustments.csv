1071449,Raycaster,2021-03-23 13:34:00,528,"Last year I fell in love trolling Lake Ontario for Salmon/Trout. Fairly poor results but with the help of members I have a list of suggestions to vastly improve this year. I only have a Legend 16’ with Mercury Bigfoot 25hp so weather is a big consideration for available days. I also have a Minn Kota 80 terrova. Anyways, even though the engine is only 25hp getting down to 2.4 mph especially with the current is tough. I have used a home made drift sock that worked fine but I recently grabbed a trolling plate (happy trolling)on kijiji for and awesome price. Its in new condition and SOLID (not tin, thick aluminum) BUT its the Large model. My question is can I run the plate at 45 degrees instead of cutting it down? It appears to have 45 degree position that could save me from cutting. I read on other forums that a plate too big will kill gas mileage and require the engine to run hot. Im really hoping to stay minimum throttle. If I have to cut the plate  I will but it would be a shame. Of course I will test first."
1071450,Fisherman,2021-03-23 13:44:00,7201,Is it the right size for that motor is the first question.  Can't hurt to run it at the half position.  Otherwise cut it down in small increments.
1071453,Raycaster,2021-03-23 14:27:00,528,"Yup, fits no problem. Guess I have to take out to check speed.  This video really opened my eyes to trolling speed:   "

1071499,OhioFisherman,2021-03-25 18:38:00,6623,I am surprised you can't troll slow enough with a 25hp with out modifying things.
1071500,Raycaster,2021-03-25 18:55:00,528,The engine purrs and runs great but throttling down towards 2 mph especially with the current is tough. Perhaps the prop Is the wrong pitch or something but the install was simple so will see. Not sure if Hamilton Bayfront launch is open to give it a try.  
1071501,dave524,2021-03-25 22:00:00,4508,"Unless things have changed since I last fished Lake O.,  2.4 mph is slower than I ever trolled , 2.75 was the usual starting point."
1071502,Loonietoon,2021-03-25 22:24:00,1450,Bay Front is open... was down there today
1071503,dave524,2021-03-25 22:32:00,4508,"I have seen when some guys cut it down, they used a hole saw to put a large hole opposite the through the hub exhaust, looked like a good ideal I thought for cooling"
1071505,Raycaster,2021-03-25 22:40:00,528,"Thx for replies guys. Bayfront open, great."
1071544,Sinker,2021-03-27 17:26:00,8692,"Seems odd you can't get below 2.4. My 40 will go slower all day than that. Weird. I was never a fan of trolling plates, but I know lots that are. S."
1071683,weekendfisher,2021-04-01 04:56:00,1,"Raycaster, 2 things must try, before experiment with trolling plate.  1, trim your motor up (raise propeller upward) to slow down boat . 2, you can easily adjust rpm of engine( lowering  rpm a tad will do the trick) . I tried these on my aluminum 30hp, works great"
1073116,Joe,2021-05-08 23:37:00,2,"How to adjust rpm? If I put throttle to a slowest position is there other options? I have a Mercury 30hp, 4 stroke thks"
