They have even asked that you send an email to make sure what you want ,gets through to them. I got  my order today and I am set up for making all my balanced trout flys for a while now. Their prices are awesome. 600 #2 and #3 ( 1-1/2 - 1-5/8 ) 90deg  black nickle and red hooks, for just over $50 and another 400 #4/#6 trout hooks for $35. I was paying $4 for just 10 hooks per pack . These are going to be my high hook baits for winter whities and perch . Got orders coming in for them already . $12 for shipping. Hook quality seems to very good as well. Nice strong hooks . My son and his buddy's, will be happy that I will have their fall supply ready on time for them ."
