1073003,Bitsmith2k,2021-05-05 18:28:00,396,aren't all coyotes in Ontario 'coywolves'? could've sworn I read that somewhere.

1073013,cisco,2021-05-06 01:56:00,597,"Pregnant coyote seems looking for a den¬†site to have her pups. Tail bone is black with no hair so perhaps frost bite is causing infection and sadly the animal may die. No hair in extremely cold weather ... why possums die of tail infection after frost bite so don't do so well here. IMHO maybe try to chase it off since her having a litter near you will surely mean hungry moma and mouths to feed. They usually pair up so maybe dad got run over/shot. Weight on em is deceiving and like Shag said the winter coat is coming off. I've weighed quite a few and 35lbs is about all they are. Never had one heavier. Her hair/being preggo makes her seem larger. As for being a wolf they have long legs almost like stilts compared to coyote. Sure could be a 'coydog' we used to call them, but apparently all coyotes have dog in them."

1073098,ch312,2021-05-08 14:58:00,1590,"Using the fence (2x4's and 1x6's), pavers (3 x 8"" ish) and diving board as scale, there's no chance that critter is 85lbs and bigger than a lab. Unless the OP has oddly oversized everything in his yard and those are 2x12 fence boards? It would be interesting to see said lab in the same positions to comparison. Keep in mind that even experienced hunters often claim a 40lb coyote is ""huge and must weigh 80 lbs!"", until the animal hits the scale.  Size, movement, and appearance all strongly suggest coyote with the onset of mange. The tail is typically the first spot to lose hair."

1072716,Fisherman,2021-04-27 15:53:00,7201,A well fed coyote mix maybe with a ratty tail.

1072720,Headhunter,2021-04-27 18:03:00,5703,"We had a vet visit for our dog this afternoon and showed the video to the vet. He thought it was a Coywolf. Arriving at home after the visit to the vet, the ""Coywolf"" was back, resting in the ravine in our backyard. I whistled to it, it just look at me, gave itself a scratch and wandered away. In thing I left out.... when it was here this morning around 9:00am and left, a group of deer showed up about an hour later. Three or four of them. My dog has been sniffing up a storm in the backyard and no, we won't let him out there without us having checked it out beforehand. Here's the ""sniffy one"" resting up for his next encounter.  "

1072737,Fisherman,2021-04-27 22:59:00,7201,People can too.
1072761,akaShag,2021-04-28 16:20:00,2073,"Wolf, or wolf/coyote cross, with an injured tail.¬† I don't think it has mange, the coat looks healthy enough for an end-of-winter coat.¬† It looks to be a fair size, like 60 pounds plus?"

1072792,Snidley,2021-04-28 22:14:00,620,I saw an episode of Nature of Things concerning Coywolfs and to me telling them apart is VERY difficult. That thing could be either without a weigh scale and maybe even a blood test. Don't let it near your dog though.
