1073029,floater,2021-05-06 19:50:00,220,I just added a Yamaha 2.5 onto my 14 foot deep and wide. It is sitting next to the main that is a Yamaha 30 two stroke. Other than and EZ steer is there another way to join these two motors so I can steer with the mains tiller arm? The smaller kicker is far enough away I have to lean over to get to the handle. There is no mounting point on the front of the smaller motor for one of those Panther threaded rods.

1073040,tomO,2021-05-06 22:32:00,363,I think if you lock the small motor to go strait ahead you can steer with the bigger one.

1073077,floater,2021-05-07 20:36:00,220,Great ideas. I will take another look at the motor. Thanks

1073090,porkpie,2021-05-08 01:02:00,2521,I bent a piece of aluminum and then drilled a couple of holes and ran the tiller arm bolts through it then mounted the Atwood version of ez steer.  They are about $30 on amazon.  Works great.

1073225,akaShag,2021-05-12 20:02:00,2073,"When I had a steering wheel, it was definitely time for the connecting brackets.  But for a tiller boat, I used a tiller extension on the kicker when I ran it.  Looks like this:  https://www.gpbikes.com/ironwood-pacific-u-001-helmsmate-extension-handles?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jg45GBH6YmNJolfZ6Xi8uSDDq4fRsQgAcpk5A46f_0kUoBFJLE_Cu2xoCOFEQAvD_BwE"
1073239,floater,2021-05-13 12:09:00,220,That tiller extension looks good. I like the way you can swivel it towards you. I will try and find one of those if the stick doesn't work. Thanks
1073241,akaShag,2021-05-13 14:02:00,2073,"There is a significant range of motion, and reach, and the throttle works well, as long as your throttle on the kicker is employed by twisting the tiller handle.  In heavy waves it is a bit tricky, but boat handling in heavy waves is always a bit tricky.
