1073450,Brook Trout Are Best,2021-05-20 13:39:00,1,I have ice fished belwood a few times but i am wondering if there are any burbot or lakers seems big enough for burbot not so sure about lakers if not what else is in the lake and where can i park
1073451,irishfield,2021-05-20 13:47:00,26272,Better walk lightly if you're going ice fishing this week... If the lake doesn't have anywhere deeper than 80 feet I doubt there's Laker's in it.
1073480,Hack_Fisherman,2021-05-21 00:35:00,720,"No burbot or Lakers. Itâ€™s a reservoir lake and they drain it way down every year. The fishing sucks frankly, better lakes elsewhere"
1073483,Rizzo,2021-05-21 00:48:00,4754,"my buddies go there and get pike, perch and walleye....but it is hit and miss. From what I have seen the best fishing is far from access points...you would want a snowmobile"
