1073649,fishdawg,2021-05-27 01:46:00,912,"Might get some browns in shallow if you find green stained water. It's transition time for the kings now, you might get some.. lots of lake trout in 70-110fow  Good luck"

1073662,Rizzo,2021-05-27 12:27:00,4754,...just checked again...winds not as bad as predicted. Why do I make my plans best on the weatherman?

1073679,Rizzo,2021-05-28 00:05:00,4754,how did it go? I opted for pike on a small inland lake instead...got enough snotrockets to last me a season
1073688,Freshtrax,2021-05-28 04:40:00,2215,End of May..  I'm usuualy slamming fish of Bronte in 160-230.   But I haven't been out yet this year.  This time of year fish can be whereever they want. I would suggest reading Dan Keatings books to anyone new to trolling
1073689,Raycaster,2021-05-28 14:17:00,528,"Headed out of Jordon (water low so launch process was sketchy and slow) but I was the only one there so no hurry. Water was a little choppy to start but smoothed out at 10am for a perfect day. Started season losing the downrigger ball right away so dipseys and shallow water it was... One day I will tell the story of when a first mate reads you the water temp 57F instead of the water depth 35ft... I was given the old Walker downrigger last year so the line needed replacing anyways. I headed south and zigzagged 40ft to 70ft and the sonar was empty most of the day. No fish, slight sunburn but overall a good day considering what its like out right now.  "
