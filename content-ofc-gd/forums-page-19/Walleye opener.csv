1072978,dintymoore,2021-05-05 02:16:00,62,"The same signs were also at the Campbelltown launch. Though, this one oddly states that this launch will open the 15th?"
1072990,Duckie,2021-05-05 13:24:00,305,the prov. government has really messed up by closing the outdoors. its the exact opposite of what their science advisors are telling them to do. no wonder we are in such a mess.
1072994,jonasdry,2021-05-05 15:12:00,63,Boat launch closures are municipal not provincial.
1072998,Duckie,2021-05-05 17:19:00,305,  true but the municipalities are taking the instructions of 'closing the outdoors' from the provincial government. they are are following the erroneous orders.
1072999,irishfield,2021-05-05 17:22:00,26272,"Municipalities are mandated to follow Provincial orders, some just are ignoring or turning a blind eye this round."

1073122,Sinker,2021-05-09 13:36:00,8692,"So, how was the fishing? I haven't gone yet, but plan to go this evening. That sign is NOT going to stop me. I am a resident of this area, and I will be launching my boat and going fishing with my family. Give me my ticket, see you in court,¬† I am done following rules that make no sense. See you on the water!! S."
1073124,misfish,2021-05-09 17:15:00,29133,"I found it funny that the marina launch was closed,but the Tiffin launch is open. Oh it was packed full of trucks and trailers this morning. I went off my float boat launch this morning. Moved numerous times. Fished from 20-80 fow. Not a single mark. Need some warmer weather me thinks. The water clarity was insane. I could see the bottom at 30 fow ."
1073132,Musky Plug,2021-05-09 20:58:00,398, I‚Äôm going next weekend for my opener. Looking forward to it.

Care to say what lure you were using? I used white twister, black twister, deep diving perch and live target minnow."
1073156,pics,2021-05-10 16:47:00,1268,I usually fish the grand but access to my spot requires my boat and they have the municipal ramp closed.. I could always take the yak.. or maybe wade in the shallower section ü§î
