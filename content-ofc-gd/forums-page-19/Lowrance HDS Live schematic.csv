1071551,BrentS89,2021-03-27 19:27:00,13,A friend has asked if I can look at his HDS Live. Wondering if anyone knows where I can get schematics ? Looks like the first transformer on the power circuit but I need a part number. Thanks.
1072630,BrentS89,2021-04-25 20:43:00,13,Just need a pic or part number. It is the common mode choke (L49). Thanks  
1072658,BillM,2021-04-26 14:06:00,17367,Call Lowrance.
1072976,BrentS89,2021-05-05 00:33:00,13,Tech at Lowrance said the part number doesn't show in their system and wondered what schematic I was looking for.
1072986,misfish,2021-05-05 10:11:00,29133,E Mail the pic. I am sure that would be the quickest way to confirm .
1073006,OhioFisherman,2021-05-05 19:06:00,6623,They may not be too eager to give out that info? It works better for them if you throw it out and buy a new one?
