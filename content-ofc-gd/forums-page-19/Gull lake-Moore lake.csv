1041641,kickingfrog,2019-03-17 03:25:00,8333,Family is looking at renting a cottage on Moore lake (just south of Minden). My only questions are: (1) Does Moore lake allow motor boats? (2) Can you motor from Moore lake into Gull lake?
1041651,mukluk,2019-03-17 13:41:00,196,(1)........Yes   Motor boats are allowed    There is even a launch on Moores. (2)........No      Cannot drive your boat between lakes.  There is a roller system built under the bridge at #35 highway. Used for cartopper boats and canoes  for easier navigating between the two lakes.
1041652,kickingfrog,2019-03-17 13:56:00,8333,Thanks for the response. The booking agent hadn't got back yet and we need to decide soon.
1041662,chris.brock,2019-03-17 21:45:00,4053,"They took out the roller system between the 2 lakes, now you'd have to carry over."
1041677,Chuck Enwinde,2019-03-18 04:20:00,247,"You can get in to Black from Moore, if you think Moore might get a little small after a few days."
1041754,chris.brock,2019-03-20 01:51:00,4053,"Black Lake for sure is a fun, worthwhile excursion. Did you book it or pass on it Rob? I know the area and some fishing and family fun things to do around there."
1041798,kickingfrog,2019-03-20 23:52:00,8333,"No, it was booked for the week we were looking. Haven't picked a place yet."
1042120,kickingfrog,2019-03-28 18:58:00,8333,Contau Lake is where we'll be spending a week this summer.
1042128,Sinker,2019-03-28 19:52:00,8692,"I think that's a better choice than moore lake.You will enjoy it up there. If you feel like checking out another lake or two, fortesque and salerno are both fun to fish as well. Musky, walleye, and bass in both, and fortesque has lakers too.  Some good rainbow/splake/speck lakes close by as well. I love that country.  S."
1042131,kickingfrog,2019-03-28 20:23:00,8333,"Three years ago we were on Salerno and had fun fishing it. This week with the extended family is not the ""hardcore"" fishing I usually prefer and is more about lots of short trips for bass and pan fish for my kids and some of the other more casual anglers in the group as well as nighttime campfire hanging out."
1073199,ScottB,2021-05-11 20:02:00,2,What fish species are in Moore lake? Im seeing different answers...
1073207,pics,2021-05-12 12:17:00,1268,I used to have a cottage in Kinmount and it's a nice area but the fishing can be hit or miss.. lots to do if they aren't biting
1073214,ScottB,2021-05-12 14:48:00,2,"Sooo, what fish species are in Moore lake?"
1073229,Dano,2021-05-12 21:41:00,719,Moore gets pretty small quickly imho.
1073235,BillM,2021-05-13 01:50:00,17367,Try the Muskoka waterweb or FishOnline.
1073236,irishfield,2021-05-13 02:07:00,26272,Who's this Dano guy......
