Fish on. Not a pike but a big fat slab!  Couple casts later,Bam! another slab! I thought, man im on'em now! Guy who was fishin a bit down the bank runs up to where i am and stomps out on the dock  to cast exactly where im casting to! Yup! Next dozen casts,when i could get a cast in, not a hit! The school spooked and....... gone! I was not happy! But i dont own the water! A bit later after he left had a nice little pike hit the clouser and chew it up! All in all a fantastic morning! Cheers!   "

1073902,Gil Levesque,2021-06-09 20:28:00,103,No. Just fishing a weighted clouser! Stop and go strip! 
1073910,BillM,2021-06-10 01:57:00,17367,"Those must have been a riot on the flyord.  For their size, I don't think there is a more vicious fish out there.  I catch them on full sized spinnerbaits all the time bass fishing."
1073916,Gil Levesque,2021-06-10 09:35:00,103,"First one i caught on Jack Lake was on a Torpedo,while bass fishing! They do hit large baits at times! And yeah, it was a blast on the fly rod!"
1073923,AKRISONER,2021-06-10 14:47:00,5558,"i run into these things throwing cranks against rock piles in the kawarthas. I also like catching them through the ice, but to catch em on the fly rod would be the ultimate.  Really really cool to catch crappies up shallow. I guess now is the time for that!"
1073924,Gil Levesque,2021-06-10 15:01:00,103,Hoping for a muskie up at jack lake this year!  Then moby dick! Lol!
1073948,npt1,2021-06-11 00:32:00,220,"I have been a fly rod guy since the mid  70's,  bass fishing in the weed's and bull rush's ,  if there only 1 fish in a body of water, it would be caught on a fly rod. "
1073955,AKRISONER,2021-06-11 13:22:00,5558,its true....nothing and I mean seemingly nothing can resist a fly. I dont think ive ever seen a fish turn away from one
