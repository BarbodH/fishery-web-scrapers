1073557,LostAnotherOne,2021-05-24 00:06:00,956,Good stuff.  Sounds like it got started with a phone call to the Ministry from the public. I keep the number in my contacts so it's there just in case. 1-877-847-7667
1073560,knightfisher,2021-05-24 03:07:00,237,"Good to hear. Makes me wonder however, how many others don't get caught."
1073562,misfish,2021-05-24 10:03:00,29133,Something tells me they were going to market.
1073575,AKRISONER,2021-05-24 16:35:00,5558,As long as the boat and equipment seize is permanent and auctioned off the punishment is harsh enough. Those fish were definitely headed to market without a single doubt
1073578,misfish,2021-05-24 18:07:00,29133,"They seize,but if fines are paid,they get them back in most cases. Back 20+ years ago, there were 4 boats locked up to a tree at a motel for 4 weeks. Large tag on them. They sat there til the fines were paid. Owners got their boats back. The charge was over harvesting perch . I watched as the CO was over 2 miles away, watching through high tec bio,s . They had them solid . Catch,take to ramp,unload,and out again they went . They were swapping out coolers."
1073581,BillM,2021-05-24 22:43:00,17367,Should have lost fishing rights forever.
1073590,Garnet,2021-05-25 11:44:00,2056,I've went to MNR seized merchandize auction couple times years ago. At Corneils Auction Little Britain.  Haven't heard of one recently.
1073593,mamona,2021-05-25 15:12:00,597,"This is awesome. What do you mean guys by ""fish were definitely headed to market""??"
1073595,misfish,2021-05-25 15:50:00,29133,"For sale in live tanks.  There are legit ones, but how can one tell."
1073597,Cleithrum,2021-05-25 18:52:00,5,Fantastic.  Call in the air strike. 
1073605,Hack_Fisherman,2021-05-25 23:31:00,720,"Won’t be long before they use drones like the MOL does on construction sites. And good on them, crack down and seize it all. "
1073616,pics,2021-05-26 14:39:00,1268,I wonder if that's how Scugog got fished out..
1073617,Fisherman,2021-05-26 14:54:00,7201,I'll bet that less than a few percent of poachers ever get caught and how many of that small number get a wallet busting fine and do it again anyway.   We used to see a particular group on Simcoe that would make repeated trips back to the car on shore with whities and then go get more.  Unfortunately no CO's around to deal with it.
1073618,mamona,2021-05-26 15:31:00,597,"Wouldn't a phone call help? Say you are witnessing a crime, wouldn't they send someone?"
1073620,Fisherman,2021-05-26 15:37:00,7201,Unfortunately they didn't have anyone in the area.
1073623,Headhunter,2021-05-26 16:31:00,5703,"We rented a cottage on Sturgeon a few years ago. We watched a group of people sharing a motel room, a group of about 12 people. They fished every day, all day keeping everything that came over the gunnels, which was mostly pannies. When the buckets got full, they would head to shore where the buckets were grabbed and taken to the room where a team of people were waiting to clean them up. This went on fro most of the week we were there. I have to suspect that they were selling the fish/fillets somewhere.... HH "
1073631,AKRISONER,2021-05-26 18:57:00,5558,thats part of the problem here...$1000 fine? They had over 100 fish in one outing. Something tells me its somewhat easy to make that $1000 back and get back to commercially fishing again in no time.
1073642,akaShag,2021-05-26 23:43:00,2073,"It says their fishing equipment was seized.  The fishing boat and trailer were seized at the scene, but it doesn't sound like they were forfeited?  And their vehicle???"
1073771,walleyeatsag,2021-06-02 15:19:00,1,I just want you to know that here in michigan our DNR is keeping a watch on fish poaching as well. We all need to keep this resource in check so we can have fish for our future generation! This is my first post but and i highly value conservation and its impact on everyone to conserve is protect! https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/MIDNR/bulletins/2dac033
