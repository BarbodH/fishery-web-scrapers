1072210,misfish,2021-04-18 17:48:00,29133,"How tiny you ask ? Well,one hook went flying out of the vise clamp. Not sure what happen there, but it made a tinkle noise on the floor right behind me on the hardwood. Turn to look and well,could not see it. Wife looks and I say, you aint going to see it. Why not, is what I get. I show her a tied fly. Yup,I aint going to see that hook. LOL So sweep the floor and well, still didn't find. Or maybe we both just did not see it.LOL"

1072755,simonb,2021-04-28 15:35:00,2,I use the furled leaders regularly; love them.Â  Little tip from experience; do not use in extreme shoulder seasons.Â  The furled leader builds ice like dipping a candle wick; then when reeling in and not watching it broke the tip of my rod!
