1073583,NathanRobert,2021-05-24 23:58:00,8,"I'd like to say 'hi' first. I grew up in Muskoka, was an avid angler. Had to move west for work, but I sill come back in the summer when I can. Caught a ton of Pike, Walleye and Bass over the years, but never a Muskie. What is a good choice for Muskie fishing close to Muskoka? I don't need to catch the biggest one ever, nor am I aiming to do anything over than catch & release. I just would like to catch one. I've been looking at Kashe lake and Blackstone & Crane lake. Also Haliburton. I fished Morrison lake a few times in the past few years but I don't think there are many Muskie in there. MNR lake data list Rosseau & Joseph as containing Muskie, but I've never heard of anyone catching one in either lake. Pike yes, but no Muskie. Thanks in advance, Nathan C."
1073584,Rizzo,2021-05-25 00:56:00,4754,"I am aware all those lakes you list have musky, but I have never targetted them there. You can add Sparrow L and Gloucester Pool to that list as well. Personally, I would drive a bit ang go to Kawarthas"
1073585,NathanRobert,2021-05-25 01:14:00,8,Yeah I was actually considering that option. From what I know there are greater numbers in those lakes.
1073588,Honorarius,2021-05-25 07:48:00,2,"Muskoka born and raised. I don't know a lot of people that go out for muskie, but those that do want to target them close to home usually go on Kashe."
1073611,singingdog,2021-05-26 11:04:00,1047,PM sent.
1073625,NathanRobert,2021-05-26 16:41:00,8,Thanks very much.
1073685,BillM,2021-05-28 02:58:00,17367,"If you actually want to catch one, head to the Kawarthas.   Crane and a few other were popular years ago, but like everything they got a tonne of pressure and it's definitely not like it used to be."
1073690,Sinker,2021-05-28 14:53:00,8692,Same with the kawarthas. Everyone is a musky pro staff these days. Its brutal. S.
1073699,BillM,2021-05-29 17:57:00,17367,"I make a few trips a year to the Kawarthas to get my confidence back up before heading home to GBay, lol!     I can't imagine the pressure those systems get day in and day out."
1073700,NathanRobert,2021-05-29 19:04:00,8,"Thanks for the replies. I really appreciate it.  Is it worth going for Musky in mid-summer, or does the bit shut down? I generally don't get back to Ontario until July-August period. Sad because I get bored of catching 14 inch Rainbow trout here in BC lol."
1073707,Rizzo,2021-05-31 12:01:00,4754,"For me: Early season is slower. Mid season is the ""quickest"" action, multi fish days would be the norm. Late season not as many numbers but fish are heavier. So yes...go in mid season! Only thing to watch out for is the water temps. Once water gets around 80 or warmer best to lay off the fish as mortality will be much higher"
1073714,BillM,2021-05-31 20:16:00,17367,My fav time for musky is the month of Sept.
1073717,NathanRobert,2021-05-31 20:59:00,8,"Cast or troll?  I generally troll for big Pike, but I know that some people fish Muskie more like Bass."
1073718,NathanRobert,2021-05-31 20:59:00,8,Good point about water temp. I don't want to kill any fish. At least Muskies.
1073719,BillM,2021-06-01 00:38:00,17367,"Casting, 100%.  I don't bother trolling until the water temps dip."
1073720,NathanRobert,2021-06-01 00:52:00,8,Is that because Muskie are holding closer to cover than Pike during the summer?
1073727,BillM,2021-06-01 03:59:00,17367,The spots I'm fishing are structure oriented.   A lot easier to pick them apart casting then it is trolling.
1073729,NathanRobert,2021-06-01 05:04:00,8,Right. Thanks for the helpful tips.
