1073530,LostAnotherOne,2021-05-22 16:24:00,956,"Not bad.  I usually use a black spinner bait with a pink tail, but going to try a spoon tomorrow.  Thanks for the report."
1073540,Gil Levesque,2021-05-23 10:42:00,103,Not lake Erie but landed this one on an ultralight using a tiny jig while crappie fishing a  couple weeks ago! Fun! 
1073541,lew,2021-05-23 11:25:00,12766,"Pike aren't fussy, they'll hit anything that moves, even baits as big as themselves  LOL "
1073542,pics,2021-05-23 12:18:00,1268,I always start with the doctor spoon and if it works I keep using it.. I like the Mepps Syclops as well because it casts far and has good action... I tried trolling without luck so running the trolling motor and casting was the ticket to getting hits..
1073587,Rizzo,2021-05-25 03:24:00,4754,"ya I got out for a few hours on the weekend as well. Spoons were top bait, cranks got some, spinnerbaits no score"
1073594,mamona,2021-05-25 15:21:00,597,"That's interesting. I fished 2 days, 2 different lakes. In my case no spoon hits. None. 	Instead pikey decided to go for jerkbaits and swimbaits."
