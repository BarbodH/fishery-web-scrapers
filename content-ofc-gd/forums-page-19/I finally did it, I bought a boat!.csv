1073306,mepps,2021-05-16 18:20:00,1301,"Someone once told me the happiest you'll be as a boat owner, is the day you buy the boat and the day you sell the boat! I'm expecting to put more money into this boat in the near future, but hopefully the cost of ownership isnt crazy!"

1073338,mepps,2021-05-17 18:17:00,1301,"A quick clip with for the first voyage on Lake O with the family, including new pup! (my oldest son wasn't able to join us, but he will next time!) I kept things slow and steady as the wife was a bit overwhelmed being on big water, luckily it was nice and calm! I had to speed up the footage to give the illusion of going fast! https://streamable.com/klrh8m "

1073373,Northerner1212,2021-05-19 01:14:00,23,Just remember boat stands for BREAK OUT ANOTHER THOUSAND $ nice boat enjoy your summer üëçüëç
1073374,AKRISONER,2021-05-19 01:15:00,5558,"Don‚Äôt worry about that, if you ensure that you use the boat frequently you won‚Äôt regret owning it for a second. my suggestion is to take it easy for the first bit on buying new gear for it because you will inevitably notice things that are broken or could use fixing and you‚Äôll want to make sure you have funding to keep those things running rather than doing additions. unfortunately boats no matter how basic will always be a money pit. But being a guy that uses his boat 10 days +a month in the summer it‚Äôs worth it. there is also of course the ‚Äúthings you can live with‚Äù and things you can‚Äôt live without. For me a guy that fishes tournaments I have no choice but to keep my boat running perfectly when it comes to pumps, electronics and motors. but owning an old boat is still worth it when you consider the price of a new one. I‚Äôll tell you right now there will always be something that needs fixing almost always. Right now for me it‚Äôs my trailers wiring and a new bilge pump (the old one works, im not a maniac i just need an auto which ive bought ive just been waiting to muster up the energy to dig around in my bilge area which is very difficult to access.) . Inevitably I will fix those tomorrow and something else will break lol just the name of the game!"
1073386,moses,2021-05-19 15:22:00,36,Congrats. Have fun on the water
1073712,saltydog,2021-05-31 16:26:00,3,That looks like a great boat.¬† I remember my first boat was a 14 foot Edson with a 20hp Johnson two stroke.¬† Nothing like the feeling of getting your first boat.¬† Now I need to get out in my boat given that some of the work around my house and also around my Mom's house is done.
1073049,mepps,2021-05-07 14:43:00,1301,"After years of pounding the pavement, paddling kayaks and canoes, renting boats and hitching ride with friends I've finally taken the plunge! With our cars and credit cards all paid off, we are completely out of debt (besides our mortgage!) and I was able to negotiate some spending with the wife. As I'm sure most of you are aware, finding a used boat in this current market is crazy, but I got ""lucky"" and found a family selling their second boat at a price.¬†It's a 1993 Sylvan Sea Monster side console with a 2000 40HP Yamaha outboard, and ready to fish! I'm the 3rd owner of the 15.5 footer, and the previous owners always kept in the the garage and provided all of the maintenance and purchase records since 1994. Looking forward to getting the whole family out on the water (which was a problem in a canoe). For anyone wondering how the negotiations went with the Mrs, she is getting a dog...a fair trade to bring my dream to a reality! I just got my hitch installed and will be bringing her home as soon as possible! She is neatly tucked away in @JonnyButts driveway and we are already counting down the days to musky season.  Let the adventures begin!  "
1073050,410001661,2021-05-07 14:56:00,127,Congrat's........she is a beauty!

1073061,AKRISONER,2021-05-07 17:09:00,5558,"Phhh found a boat with a yammy at a price that isn‚Äôt way too astronomically high...you won the lottery pal. enjoy your summer fishing it, and next year at this time you can commence dreaming about your next 19 foot boat, and so on lol"

1073067,Rizzo,2021-05-07 19:28:00,4754,awesome! congrats on the first boat she is a beaut!
1073070,Big Cliff,2021-05-07 19:46:00,6899,Looks like a reall nice ride and getting a dog for your wife wasn't a bad deal either üòâ
1073071,mepps,2021-05-07 19:51:00,1301,"I can use the bailer from the boat, no?  Thanks everyone! Feels like a lottery win for sure. I had been looking for a few months and there aren't a lot of great options unless I wanted to pay over $7500¬†which wasn't going to happen (unlesss I wanted 20HP and less). The seller said he had 40 people contact them within the first few hours, and even though I offered to buy it unseen (they had posted lots of photos), they said I had to go in person. I got there as another guy was viewing the boat and I started chatting with the owner about fishing and found out he has¬†a place on Lake Nipissing (which I visited years ago at Lakeair during an OFC trip, so we had a great chat). The other guy, who didn't look away from his phone (Facetime) and didn't even say hello when he arrived made a low ball offer, and the owner looked at me and said ""You want to buy a boat?"" of course I said ""Absolutely, I would like nothing more than to own this boat!"" and he told the other guy ""Sorry, it's sold."" One of the happiest moment in my life, I felt a connection to this boat the moment I laid eyes on it, and the Yammy is exactly what I wanted!"
1073073,AKRISONER,2021-05-07 19:52:00,5558,"Lol dog for the wife...ya ok, that‚Äôs why my current dog cash, was originally my ex girlfriends lol"
1073075,AKRISONER,2021-05-07 19:53:00,5558,"And buying a boat should feel much like buying a house, when you see it you simply know it‚Äôs the one from the get go, If you are humming and hawing...go find a different boat"
1073079,captpierre,2021-05-07 21:11:00,2521,That‚Äôs a chick magnet if I ever saw one. üëå

1073089,pics,2021-05-08 00:23:00,1268,"You have to act fast on the good boats.¬† When I bought mine last year I went with cash for a down payment, then went right to the bank for a draft when I decided I was buying it.. it was a bit of a gamble as it was 3 hours from my house.¬† Mine is also a Sylvan and it's my second one.. they are good solid boats.."
1073095,porkpie,2021-05-08 09:25:00,2521,"Nice rig, you did good!"

1073099,dintymoore,2021-05-08 15:49:00,62,Nice. I loved my old Sylvan. Solid boats.
1073102,cisco,2021-05-08 16:22:00,597,Great buy! Congrats! OK you got one without testing her out first. Not sure how old it is so check to see the deck wood is solid as well as the transom. Get the 'ear muffs' and hook the garden hose up to run it to make sure water is pumping out or impeller needs replaced. Want to ensure she's ready to go when you're ready to go!
1073105,Big Cliff,2021-05-08 19:01:00,6899,"Some good advice however muffs don't always give you a good indication of how well the impeller is working since you are applying pressurized water. Better to put it in a lake or a tank, better yet just replace the impeller if you have any doubts at all."
