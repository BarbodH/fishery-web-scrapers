1073249,captpierre,2021-05-14 22:28:00,2521,Hey Gents. Any tricks to opening a tiny splitring to replace a hook. Â  Before I go insane trying. Peter  
1073253,OhioFisherman,2021-05-15 01:13:00,6623,"LOL, Peter those aren't the tiny ones, I am guessing size 2 or 3. A pair of split ring pliers works best, but if you can pry it with an old butter knife"
1073254,AKRISONER,2021-05-15 03:05:00,5558,Split ring pliers
1073256,BillM,2021-05-15 03:47:00,17367,Stick another gook into the split ring to open it up.Â  Â  Split ring pliers will be the best idea by far though.
1073258,Garnet,2021-05-15 11:34:00,2056,"Shimano makes very good split ring pliers. They are offset so you can see little better. Now the process! You open the split ring and slide old hook into gap move it a little then slide new hook in beside old hook. Run the old/new hook around split ring , old hook is off new hook on."
1073259,captpierre,2021-05-15 12:00:00,2521,Thanks for that. But the ring is tiny. Tried and tried. Maybe should get a bigger ring.
1073266,captpierre,2021-05-15 16:47:00,2521,Figured something out. Just canâ€™t hold a 3-4 mm split ring in my thick fingers well. Grabbed the ring with needle nose pliers and spread with a small flat screwdriver. Hook went in easy. Those Shimano split ring pliers are about $40 ðŸ˜³
1073267,misfish,2021-05-15 17:17:00,29133,Try a butter knife. Works for me in a pinch.
1073271,lew,2021-05-15 18:41:00,12766,Even on large musky baits a screwdriver was all I ever used.
1073272,OhioFisherman,2021-05-15 18:54:00,6623,"https://www.ebay.com/itm/114065290899?hash=item1a8ed23693:g:NRwAAOSweBpeqt7A These ones work well, and so do some of the even cheaper ones on Ali."
1073282,irishfield,2021-05-15 22:16:00,26272,What pocket knifes are for...
1073283,AKRISONER,2021-05-15 23:36:00,5558,"I used to do this with a leatherman, before I had splitting pliers. I stopped after stabbingÂ myself multiple times lol"
1073289,John,2021-05-16 11:57:00,2956,What he said...
1073290,Rizzo,2021-05-16 12:27:00,4754,"I used to jam a hook in there too...until I discovered that split ring pliers were $5 at my local tackle shop. Forget the $40 one you saw, they can be had for waaayy less. Pretty sure I got mine at Natural sports in Kitchener."
1073292,Garnet,2021-05-16 14:13:00,2056,I have about 10 pairs of split ring pliers and your chubby fingers shouldn'tÂ  be involved. Good split ring pliers should open split ring and also grip the ring. So cubby fingers holding both hook and plier moving ring. Don't think I paid $40 for Shimano pliers maybe $18.
1073293,captpierre,2021-05-16 14:28:00,2521,Thanks. You know what they say about guys with big hands and chubby fingers ðŸ˜Ž
1073297,Sinker,2021-05-16 15:40:00,8692,"Yeah, you gotta get a pair of split ring pliers. Best thing ever. You will wonder why you even tried without them.  S."
1073613,WHO,2021-05-26 12:47:00,6,AÂ staple remover works just fine. Cheap & efficient.
1073614,manfish,2021-05-26 13:17:00,24,What year was that?
1073627,Rizzo,2021-05-26 16:46:00,4754,"5 years ago? maybe fewer? They had a big bin of them...no wrapping, no packaging, just a whole bunch of these pliers in a bin. Maybe it was a one time thing where they got an awesome bulk deal?"
1073645,porkpie,2021-05-27 00:43:00,2521,Grab end of split ring with needle nose. Â Press hook shank into the ring to separate. Â Slide hook onto ring. Â Walla!
