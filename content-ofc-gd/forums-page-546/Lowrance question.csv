577767,darsky,2011-04-29 22:10:00,586,Can I simply sub the LGC 3000 puck for the LGC 2000 ?  My 2000 may be defective and Cabelas has the 3000 on sale.
577771,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-29 22:23:00,0, I'd think there would be a way but they change the damn plug ends all the time and from one unti to the next.
577788,Uncle Buck,2011-04-29 23:08:00,1000,"don't think it's just the plugs...  Humminbirds have different pucks also...  about the amount of signals they can recieve...  4, 16 or the new one is 50... not sure about the lowrance?"
577944,hawk-eye,2011-04-30 14:34:00,141,Lowrance website has a comptability chart. Should be able to find out there.
577953,Billy Bob,2011-04-30 15:35:00,5865,I believe it's a plug and play with MAYBE a software upgrade available from the Lowrance site.
