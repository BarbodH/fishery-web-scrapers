576851,bullybass,2011-04-27 20:38:00,144,It was a monster fish with a heck of a fight on the ultralight!! Small lake that produces quite well with bass pike and walleye as well.
576853,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-27 20:44:00,3761,"The gill flap on Bluegill is black in color, Pumpkinseed have a redish mark on the gill flap. Nice pic's guys."

577185,ch312,2011-04-28 16:40:00,1590, nope. there's no way on earth i'm sharing this honey hole
577227,EC1,2011-04-28 18:10:00,930,"I remember one night a couple years back while fishing for crappie I got a bluegill that was give or take 13 inches.  Dumb enough, I listen to the people around me, ""OH WOW, THAT THING IS GOING TO BE DELICIOUS STEAMED!"". Took it home and did exactly that....Was the nastiest tasting fish I've ever had. The fish just tasted like weeds and the meat was way tough.  Now this is probably one of the biggest regrets panfishing in my years of fishing. I ate a gross fish, and never even got a picture of it. Now it's all just a fishing story......I've yet to have caught or seen one that is similar in size anymore."

576604,Michael_Brown,2011-04-27 01:35:00,411,"Rice Lake is full of big gills.  9 inch pumkinseed and a 10 inch bluegill.  If these fish grew to 10lbs they would rip your arms off.     I love that first picture in this thread, looks like the fish swam into a wall. Tank gill."
576606,moparhawk,2011-04-27 01:38:00,146,Heres one from Saturday from a local rock quarry pond

576615,livinisfishin,2011-04-27 02:12:00,661,Do you guys eat bluegill? Never tried them before are they similar to crappie?
576644,gil,2011-04-27 03:11:00,41,"Sorry mercman, that's a Punkinseed  not a bluegill"
576645,gil,2011-04-27 03:14:00,41,Yeah man!!!  They are like candy!
576646,Beans,2011-04-27 03:18:00,3339," A bit sweeter than crappie...just the right size for a hamburger bun, slice of cheese and some tarter sauce...   "
576670,pikehunter,2011-04-27 09:31:00,1659," That fish is so fat it looks like a cartoon character, look at the chin and mouth on it. Nice catch fersure!"
576671,crappieperchhunter,2011-04-27 09:38:00,2582, Much better then crappie IMHO. Last spring my crappie spot was overrun with big gills...lots over 10 inches. Needless to say the crappie I was catching went back in the lake.
576675,bullybass,2011-04-27 10:24:00,144,Here is mine from a couple years back!   
576678,livinisfishin,2011-04-27 10:59:00,661,They look like a lot of fun to catch I am definitely going to have to try and locate some lakes around here with them. Just curious but what's the best way to distinguish them between larger sunfish? They look pretty dark but I have caught some fairly large pumpkinseed that I thought were bluegill at the time.

576688,dave524,2011-04-27 11:29:00,4508," This is a good resource for sunfish ID, there has been a few besides Bluegill and Pumkinseed found in the Lake Erie drainage srea.  http://www.tnfish.org/FishIdentificationID_TWRA/TWRA_Sunfish_Identification_Key.htm"

576836,jimmer,2011-04-27 19:57:00,2730,"The quickest way to tell the bluegill and pumpkinseed apart is that the pumpkinseed has the red mark on the edge of the gill, bluegills do not have this red mark."
576838,jimmer,2011-04-27 20:00:00,2730,"That is a monster sunfish, that's for sure. It must have given you quite the battle."
