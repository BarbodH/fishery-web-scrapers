576999,Live2fish85,2011-04-28 02:19:00,1633,The habs did do good they played awesome. I would have rather seen them win then the Bruins but oh well I'm not to upset either way. lol
577007,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-28 02:27:00,4399,"pretty good series, Boston is touted has a serious cup contender and Montreal took them to seven games with 3 in overtime!!!  Good Luck to the Bruins and their fans in the next round!!!"
577026,Tootsie II,2011-04-28 02:52:00,162,50% per cent for tonite. Habs lose but Owen Sound Attack win OHL Western Conference championship. They get an automatic birth in Memmorial Cup even if the should lose league championship series to Missy St.Mike's Majors.
577085,corvette1,2011-04-28 12:01:00,1765,its about time we beat the habs now we need to make up for last year
577402,Gutpile,2011-04-28 23:26:00,27,Price played well. The good guys won in the end.  Bring on the Flyers.  Go Bruins Go!!!!!
577404,misfish,2011-04-28 23:31:00,29133,"Price played very well,better then most thought he would, and will continue to do so the next years to come. Great series. Im a Boston fan,but the flyers are tougher then the CANADIANS."
577545,dhickey,2011-04-29 06:17:00,1038,  the flyers have always been a tough team. it only goes so far. Boston has a higher skiil set. montreal was clearly faster but Boston had a wider range of skilled players. flyers might be big and strong and they will do damage to Bostons line up in the first 2 games but i think skill will win so long as chara and horton keep their heads clear and up. phily will be gunning for them.  mabey we could have this thread title changed to play off hockey instead of habbbbbs seing as their pollishing their clubs.  can the mods do that without causing a fuss?  just asking . not looking to start any thing.
577551,solopaddler,2011-04-29 10:55:00,8605,"  Well if Boston has more skill they sure didn't show it against Montreal.  Their game was brutal, missed passes, non existant powerplay...  I believe they should feel VERY lucky to have gotten past Montreal.  I am glad they won. For me it's like the lesser of two evils compared to Montreal.  As a completely unbiased observer I predict that unless Boston elevates their game dramatically, Philly will beat them handily."
577566,jediangler,2011-04-29 12:30:00,1923,Boston certainly didn't play their best against the Habs and should never have let it go to 7 games but they did win 3 OT games and the series without a PP goal. Montreal played great but their hearts were bigger than their bodies in the long run and Price isn't Patty Roy when it comes to OT games. They have some good young guys coming along that will benefit from this series and they'll be tougher to beat next year.
577569,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-29 12:39:00,4399,"Philly might win if they find a goalie,rumour has it they are getting the trainer a set of pads!"
574247,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-19 21:20:00,4399, Funny you mention that because the game I watched it was the habs that were intiating most of the contact!
574691,F7Firecat,2011-04-20 22:16:00,347," Fishgreg,  I took my family to a habs game in Montreal in January ironically it was against Boston. You will have the best time of your life there.  I have never experienced a hockey atmosphere ever like I did in Montreal, hands down the best hockey atmosphere ever, only other one maybe Detroit. I can imagine a playoff game.  Have fun!"

575753,bobowski,2011-04-24 13:14:00,360,What a great game last night. That ovetime had me on the edge of my seat. I love seeing the Habs lose.
575756,Rod Caster,2011-04-24 13:24:00,5784,great game indeed. I was on the habs bandwagon and i fell off pretty hard. I doubt they'll win the series now.  
576091,lhousesoccer,2011-04-25 14:57:00,442,"Quite honestly, I think if Montreal can win Game 6 at home tomorrow night, it's anyones series on Thursday in Boston.  Montreal won the first two games in Boston and last Saturday's game in Boston was about as even-sided as you can get from two teams.  Full on power hockey for the whole game, back and forth skating, chances at either end, goalies standing on their heads both making spectacular savings, then Double OT.  It was anyone's game.  Neither team showed dominance.  I think Game 7 in Boston could go either way, if it gets there.  Personally, I'd like to see Montreal win.  I'm a Leafs fan, but not your typical Leafs fan.  Most Leafs fans love to love any team that beats Montreal.  For me, when the Leafs are out of it, I go to supporting Montreal.  I can thank my grandfather on my mother's side for that, who was a die-hard Habs fan his whole life.  Any whoever said watching a game in Montreal is unlike any other experience you'll have, is bang on.  I've been lucky enough to see 7 NHL games in person in my 41 years.  Growing up in Ontario south of London, I managed to get tickets to two Leafs game when I was in university in Peterborough.  Then, I ended up in Vermont and I'm 2.5 hours to downtown Montreal, and 2.75 hours to downtown Boston.  I have a friend on Montreal with seasons tickets and I've managed to get to 3 games there, and my brother-in-law works for a financial firm who slides him Boston Garden tickets once in a while, so I've seen 2 games there.  The crowd, the history, the pre-game show, the atmosphere in Montreal blows everything else away.  Of course, one game I saw in Montreal was against Toronto.  I let my wife wear my Habs jersey, and I wore my Leafs jersey.  It's a good thing I also speak french - that way I at least knew what was being yelled at us!"

Nowhere in the question did the reporter mention bobby orr, so one can only think that PK is comparing his Spin-o-rama to bobby orrs and thus his game to bobby orrs.   IMO!!!!!!!!!!!  Next point: what type of critisism was he receiving last November when the article was written? I was under the impression that he was the toast of the town back then?  As far as the attitude he presents, I say bring it on, we need more quality Sean Avery and Matt Cook type mouths in the league, next thing you know they'll be taking down the glass and installing ropes and turnbuckles.

Subban’s got skills, and he isn’t afraid of letting people know it or of people thinking less of him for it, as this tweet today from local reporter Arpon Basu will surely prove:   “Asked Subban today if his spin-o-rama could be construed as cockiness. ‘Well, then Bobby Orr was the cockiest player in NHL history.’”   Somehow Subban is able to both make the greatest comeback ever AND seem like a delusional schizo for comparing himself to Orr! How does he do it? Who knows? Just one of his many skills, it looks like. He’s got charisma, and that’s why we love him.   My linkMy link  Might need facebook to open these 2 links  and yes I think he is a much better player than Coulton Orr, it was just a quote I heard on the satellite radio NHL channel last year that stuck with me,  but comparing himself to Bobby Orr (that article was written last November) after just a handfull of NHL games?  He must need special order hockey pants to fit his nutz in there!  jjcanoe"

573361,ctranter,2011-04-17 19:23:00,543,"I loved watching the Habs dismantle Boston the past 2 games.  I may not be a Habs fan, but when the cup is on the line it's always better in Canada.  Boston uses the exact same breakout over and over and they cough it up half the time.  The other half, their forwards skate directly to the outside wings and take a long, weak, wrist shot.  You know, it seems as though the Bruins almost lack a speedy sniper on wing, or is it just me? As well, Tim Thomas, the supposed top goalie in the NHL beginning this season looks very average against this Habs team.  Also, so what you want about PK.  When have you ever seen a player that was able to get under peoples skin and take them off their game AND be a top player for their position.  Like it or not, PK is turning out to be a great player on both the offensive and defensive sides of his game, in addition to being a frustrating ""Sean Avery"" like personality."
573364,Gregoire,2011-04-17 19:40:00,1397,"jjcanoe you continue to out loser yourself with each post. PK was not comparing himself to Bobby Orr. He was saying that Orr did spin o ramas and no one ever called him cocky for that. Suban is a cocky guy, but only someone with a hate on would take this quote and misconstrue it as PK comparing himself to possibly the greatest player to ever play the game. Get real and stop posting mindless drivel. Or at least start your own thread bashing PK and the Habs. Your massive discretion in interpreting this quote would be similar to myself saying I'm as good an angler as Pete Maina because I fish for musky just like he does. Get real. People making generalizations like you just did is one of th things that pisses me off about the way our society thinks sometimes."
573365,PikeMolester,2011-04-17 19:42:00,428,"I don't get how you Leaf and Sens fans still hang on to your hate for the HABS when its playoffs and your teams are golfing...The HABS come first but when the HABS don't make the playoffs I set aside my hatred for the Sens and even the Leafs (not that they ever make the playoffs) as a Canadian. I want to see Canadian teams go as far as possible. If you are american or a real Boston fan for some reason, I understand. The Leaf fans are just very envious and bitter cause they have no clue that winning ever feels like anymore and wish us horrible deaths in a grease fire. Meanwhile the Leafs are watching playoff hockey on TV........FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS IN A ROW!"
573391,solopaddler,2011-04-17 21:52:00,8605,  Personally I couldn't care less whether it's a Canadian or US team in the playoffs. Most of the players are Canadian anyway.  If it's a team I actively dislike why would I suddenly cheer for them?  No envy or bitterness on my part at all.
573396,Gregoire,2011-04-17 22:06:00,1397,I think there's something about the cup coming back to Canada that makes me want to cheer on Canadian teams. As a country we carry the NHL. I would love to see the cup come home to Canadian soil even if the leafs won it. I guess it's misplaced patriotism on my part.
573400,RustyShackleford,2011-04-17 22:16:00,15,"jjcanoe's lack of understanding and interpretation from that interview is mind boggling. PK was getting flak because he is a little cocky and uses a little swagger when we have been bombarded with the NHL of the last 5 years that frowns upon such actions...an NHL where regardless of how clean a hit is you now have to start a scrum or a brawl after any big hit in the regular season....PK does things his own way, if you don't like it, cheer for the other team..he doesn't need anyones approval."

573514,PikeMolester,2011-04-18 06:40:00,428,"this quote... “Asked Subban today if his spin-o-rama could be construed as cockiness. ‘Well, then Bobby Orr was the cockiest player in NHL history.’” this was your first line in the post.   ""Check out this article where Subban directly compares himself to Bobby Orr"" That first line was a false interpretation of statement and sounded like a news anchor trying to hook an audience to listen to a news story then after hearing it...the audience being like oh...well that's not interesting... How misleading LOL Do you work in media? Run a gossip column? You should... In my opinion there is no way it can be understood as PK comparing his talents to being the next Bobby Orr's. He's defending himself from the criticism he's received. I'm tired of all the monotone hockey player interviews and political correctness. I love his sarcasm and flare. It pissed me off when Jacques Martin scolded him at the start of the year for excessive celebrating and flamboyancy. Jacques has always been conservative and old school. Any buzz is good buzz. Lame veterans don't like flamboyant youngsters coming in the league and stepping on toes no doubt. Is PK supposed to get run over by veterans and keep his mouth shut? Is he supposed to change the style of hockey he plays which has made him the player he is so that he can play simple  ABC hockey? It's not who he is and probably wouldn't be in the NHL. Was Ovechkin's enthusiasm not a complete turn around in Washington? He was criticized even more than PK obviously. Eyes are on Montreal and a young confident upcoming superstar! He will never have Bobby Orr's numbers. The league and everything about it is different but how many other defense men can skate and shoot the puck like that? The Prongers and Lidstroms have their place. Not many like Subban though so he sticks out...also he's a black Dman in the NHL. Yet another thing that sets him apart to stand out. IT'S HIS ROOKIE SEASON and he is in the upper echelon of NHL defense men already. He has proven he is in no way detrimental to the team or the league."

573132,RustyShackleford,2011-04-17 01:55:00,15,"Yeah baby, everytime PK touches the puck and the Bruins fans start booing my smile grows larger. Wearing the 76 jersey every game!!!!"
573135,DundasSteelheader,2011-04-17 02:01:00,166,Picked Boston to win the cup in a hockey pool..
573137,F7Firecat,2011-04-17 02:13:00,347,"WOOT WOOT!!   Can you say shutdown.  The only thing Boston is good at in the last two games is cheapshots.  PK and Gill.........Wisniewski, Hamrlik, Sopel, Spacek getting er dun!!!!  Team effort for sure!!"
573140,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-17 02:23:00,4399,"Well they are the big bad bruins!!!  I guess they thought the smurfs were gonna roll over and lay down, big and slow is not a good combination in the playoffs.  I am thinking Lucic and Horton would like to crawl in a hole,they are stinking the joint out!"
573142,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-17 02:25:00,0,"outworked, outdisciplined, and outcoached so far..."
573149,muskymike,2011-04-17 02:52:00,772,I picked Boston to get out of the first round but get beat out of the second....what is going on here....  Boston has a Mountain to climb. The good thing is the West will have the Cup this year.
573175,PikeMolester,2011-04-17 05:54:00,428,HABS WHAAAAAAAATTTT! Boston isn't even looking like Boston...they are playing soooo terrible. GO HABS GOOOOOOO!
573186,Grimace,2011-04-17 10:44:00,2020,Goalie.     That Goalie is incredible.
573196,Gregoire,2011-04-17 12:29:00,1397,It is fun to watch. Boston is going to come out firing on all cylinders next game. If the Habs can win game 3 they are setting themselves up for a long playoff run. I hope that the coaching staff and the players get that message and play that way. If they can put the Bruins away in 4 or 5 games they have a chance to win a second round series. I think they need the rest after all the injuries this year. I'm going to be in Montreal on Friday so I'd love to get out and watch a game but I'd take a sweep as a consolation.
573200,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-17 12:39:00,4399,"  I think they look exactly like Boston, BIGSLOOOOOOWSTUPID!!! Like the Dr. mention out coached big time the only coaching Julien has been doing is looking at the replay screen and whinning and complaining,it is beyond me how a guy can complain about the officiating with the collections of mutts he has on his team. Every time that big dummy Lucic and his twin sister Horton are on the ice they could and should be called for crosschecking/slashing.  Going to be interesting if they come back with Thomas or go with Rask in game 3,frankly I don`t think it matters!"
573231,jjcanoe,2011-04-17 14:12:00,744, just don't park your car downtown.... if they win a game it might be upsidedown and on fire when you return!
573233,jjcanoe,2011-04-17 14:15:00,744,  man all these habs fans think that Subban is the next Bobby Orr..... He's slightly better than Coulton Orr......
573235,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-17 14:19:00,4399,Bobby who???
573237,jjcanoe,2011-04-17 14:23:00,744,PK Subban Stats  Coulton Orr Stats  Bobby Orr Stats  
573245,Gregoire,2011-04-17 14:39:00,1397, That may go down as oneof the dumbest posts ever. He's no Bobby Orr but he is definitely a talented player.
573247,F7Firecat,2011-04-17 14:43:00,347,"  hahaha Julien was too busy whining to calm his team down and the next thing he knew it was 2-0 HABS!  something about the Bruins------looks like Lucic, Chara and Horton are cross bred with a YETI and a Sasquatch  Boston had their chances, no need to say more.  Gotta love Nealy and his co hort up in the office. LOL"
573252,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-17 14:50:00,4399,"  Don`t think so Greg check his latest post!  There is a never ending supply of dumb posts here, I have probably contributed to that category myself the odd time!!!"
573257,jjcanoe,2011-04-17 15:03:00,744, really? dumbest ever? because that's who habs fans were comparing him to last year in the playoffs.....after 5 or 6 games...... just saying......
573272,Chance,2011-04-17 15:33:00,420,"Great games to watch.The bruins are falling apart from the top on down.When all goes to crap you look at your leader for advice.In this case julien...who is running back and forth with his hands in the air yelling.Take a look at the habs both on the ice and on the bench, no over the top emotion just a dedicated look.The bruins are thinking short term,todays win and thats it.The habs are thinking long term.With short term thinking comes undisciplined aggression and RETALIATION.Long term thinking results in discipline and controlled emotions. The biggest showboat on the team PK has even bought into it.The kids good but he just needed to get his ""HEAD"" into the game.Looks like he has done just that! Great job by the habs,hoping a Canadian team can bring the cup back where it belongs!"
