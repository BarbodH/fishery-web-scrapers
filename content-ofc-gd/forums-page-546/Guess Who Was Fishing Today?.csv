577004,skeeter,2011-04-28 02:23:00,1907,"ME  Finally got to trade in the suckers and shakers for something that took me for a real good run. He tried to run me into an over hanging tree down stream but i had my waders on, and made a quick jump off the bank and into the creek. Why is it that the one's that get off always run up stream but the one's that are hooked good run down stream, so you have to fight them and the current?    PS: Thanks Geoff for the secret spot!!!!!"
