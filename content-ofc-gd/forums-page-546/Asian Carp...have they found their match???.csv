577557,danbouck,2011-04-29 11:57:00,4380,Awesome!
577559,Jer,2011-04-29 12:09:00,1426,It don't look like the carp have much to worry about...
577561,NAW,2011-04-29 12:17:00,4022,Good for a morning Chuckle!
577563,kickingfrog,2011-04-29 12:21:00,8333,I don't see how that could possibly end badly.
577571,dsn,2011-04-29 12:43:00,1018,Looks like the sword was a bad idea. The freddie glove is better idea.   Funny  thanks  carper
577572,Lunker777,2011-04-29 12:43:00,866,?????
577575,corvette1,2011-04-29 12:48:00,1765,wait to when we are fishing like them in lake ontario it won't be funny
577581,Headhunter,2011-04-29 12:54:00,5703,"Thanks for posting this Cliff! I would probably trade the sword for a 12 gauge, but I gotta admitt, that looked like fun! HH"
577590,ChrisK,2011-04-29 13:13:00,2772,Looks like a lot of fun but seriously....Somebody is going to get impaled or smoked into a tree
577595,bubbles,2011-04-29 13:36:00,591,That was fantastic
577598,mbosh1980,2011-04-29 13:49:00,349,Might be more effective to just boat around with a wide hopper wood chipper mounted on the front...
577607,bow slayer,2011-04-29 14:20:00,1074,I'm in.
577617,Live2fish85,2011-04-29 15:09:00,1633,"I agree looks like it would be fun, when he was swinging that sword all I could think was he's going to slice his leg off or when he falls that knife is going to come back at him."
577621,davis,2011-04-29 15:18:00,128,LOL that.was.awesome! thanks for the laugh
577627,ctranter,2011-04-29 15:43:00,543,"LOL you guys are far too responsible!  That was epic.  I agree, the Freddy Claw was far more lethal than the samurai sword."
577630,Terry,2011-04-29 15:50:00,14456,it's something that will/should be in the next Jackass movie
577677,kickingfrog,2011-04-29 17:29:00,8333,"  Those spikes on the shin pads and helmet would help him ""stick"" to said tree and keep him from drowning."
577687,splashhopper,2011-04-29 18:05:00,2931,funny ... but what a mess to deal with now
577690,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-29 18:17:00,0,hahahahahahaha
