I don't mind a little competition, but I am not a fan of fishing shoulder to shoulder for a pool of spooked fish!   The bite was fairly steady, where I went, and I didn't see another fisherman all day, I had fish on in almost every hole that I fished and went 4 for 5 over all, most being in the in the 2-3 lb range, here are a couple of the fish that I caught at the first spot.                 I moved on to the next creek and I lost a decent sized bow right at the bank, the hook popped out of its mouth and she took off downstream.   I got this one right before I was planning on leaving on my 10th ""last drift"", it didn't put up much of a fight compared to the smaller fish. I think it has been in the creek for a while now, it was way darker than any of the other fish I caught, and it looks like it was spawned out. All fish were released to spawn another day, hopefully I will catch them again next year!   "
