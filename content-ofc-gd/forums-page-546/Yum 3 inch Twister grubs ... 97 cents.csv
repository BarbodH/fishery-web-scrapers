577412,muddler,2011-04-28 23:39:00,623,Just a heads up.  My favourite grub for walleye (Yum pink and white) are avaiable at the local Giant Tiger for 97 cents per 8 pack. A 15 pack at CTC is 4.99 here. I bought 63 packs (mixed up the colours).  I don't know if they are available at all stores but definately worth a look.  muddler
