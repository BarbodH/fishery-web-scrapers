577220,mbosh1980,2011-04-28 18:04:00,349,I could only find mine online. Be aware it is a lighter lure than what you might be used to throwing for musky.  Haven't caught anything on mine yet but a regular one is one of my favourite bass baits.
577280,Headhunter,2011-04-28 19:13:00,5703,"Don't know for sure, but you might want to give the folks at Tightlines in Pickering a call... I think I have seen them there. HH"
577375,Rizzo,2011-04-28 22:33:00,4754,"if you can't find it at least there are lots of other big topwaters to choose from! I haven't personally ever seen one at LB's, JB's, or BPS"
577392,misfish,2011-04-28 23:13:00,29133,"Im not a musky guy,but I would think a big old bullfrog and a 1/0 hook would work the same.  Boss if I see one,I,ll be sure to let you know. I see the local Princess auto has some big musky baits here in Barrie. Well not for long now.Frank just seen this and on his way to buy them.LOL"
577415,mike rousseau,2011-04-28 23:56:00,4661,Not sure... They're great tho... I have 4 of em... Mine are older tho... Lebaron used to carry them
577493,Henricus,2011-04-29 01:57:00,118,"Call the guys at JB's...best Musky selection around.  Was there week before the Odyssey (they weren't at the Odyssey, had committed to another show for same day) and couldn't believe the stock.  Didn't see one at the time but if you are going to find one, they will lead you to it.  Good luck."
577496,muskymike,2011-04-29 02:01:00,772,If you can somehow make it to a Bass Pro or Gander Mtn. in the states they are DIRT CHEAP. I paid $3/each for mine. Ask BillyBob to have a look. I got mine at Gander on Colvin Blvd in Amherst??? Tonawanda?? Between the Falls and Buffalo on 290 hahahahhaha.
