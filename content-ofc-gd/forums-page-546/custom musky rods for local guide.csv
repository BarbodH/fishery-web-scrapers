577501,Rodwrap,2011-04-29 02:19:00,130,"Quite a project.. building matching rods always requires extra ""jazz""..Ya hafta count the turns sometimes to get things even. I took 2 St.Croix 8'6"" musky blanks & extended them to 9'7"" ( Apparently, Red wants to pole-vault to shore from 50' out   )  I created custom decals using an Alps printer( can print white) from his logo. He also wanted ""subtle"" wraps..I don't do subtle well( in anything   )...So...I used cobalt blue thread, then threw in some prism holoshimmer trim to satisfy MY needs.  A nice pair of meatsticks..may they put fish in the boat..to be released...     "
577530,mike rousseau,2011-04-29 03:43:00,4661,If you don't mind me askin...  What's the cost of a pair like that...  Pm if you don't wanna post...  I'm in the market for 2 nice trolling rods
577533,archie_james_c,2011-04-29 03:50:00,618,"I need the cost on some services too! Didn't know we had a rod builder on the forum. Last summer I had REW over on Walleye Central build me a 6'3"" Croix SCIV with recoils."
577547,Spiel,2011-04-29 09:38:00,9065,Very nice.
577550,solopaddler,2011-04-29 10:49:00,8605," You're not aware that Spiel, one of the moderators is a custom builder?   (He wasn't going to say it so someone had to.  )   Some decent work on the musky rods from rodwrap. Question to you sir. The first thing that popped to mind was with a 12"" extension in the butt where's the joint in relation to the reel seat?  No worries that when the rod is under load it'll break at that joint?"
577555,Rodwrap,2011-04-29 11:40:00,130,"I always use an extension piece of lower modulus ( fiberglas saltwater blank in this case). The reel seat is still on the blank proper, not on the extension. I also wrap the blank with ""A"" thread, & finish to the point where the extension piece ends ( almost to the butt guide in this case.) I loaded the rods with a pretty good stress test..all ok  Fellow builders on the east coast often glue aluminum tubing inside surf blanks to extend them up to 2 feet..."
577580,Rizzo,2011-04-29 12:54:00,4754,"better call Jim Saric and get him a rod or 3, he was waving around a ""puny"" 9 footer at the Odyssey a few weeks back, will be jealous of a 9'6"""
