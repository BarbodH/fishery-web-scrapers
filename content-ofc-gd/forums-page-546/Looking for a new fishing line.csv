577772,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-29 22:26:00,10439,"Ok, I am looking for a clear 20# line that is supple, strong, thin diameter and doesn't have a lot of stretch.  I am looking for a line that is similar in handling to Raven 12# mainline. It can't be too stiff or it won't work. I will be using it in a semi-tropical area (temps in the 80's F), it also needs to be abrasion resistant  as it will be used around corals and mangroves.  Anyone got any options?"
577775,Muskieman,2011-04-29 22:43:00,2472,If you can find it and it's not dry-rotted ... the OLD antiquated Du Pont Magnum 14/40 Oval/Flat Mono... would work just fine.  What about good ol' Trilene XT?   Randy 
577777,mercman,2011-04-29 22:48:00,7054,"I would wait till you get to where yer goin, and check out the local tackle shops.They would probably have exactly what you need.          So where are ya goin, he asked knowingly Nudge nudge"
577784,misfish,2011-04-29 23:02:00,29133,"I do believe they sell Andie down where yer going.Ah yes,it comes in pink."
577817,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-30 00:28:00,10439,Ande and Trilene XT are too stiff. I need a 20# linethat will work well on a centerpin.
577858,fishinguypat,2011-04-30 02:11:00,547,why not just go with a clear braid?
577859,splashhopper,2011-04-30 02:12:00,2931,  Is there such a thing?
577865,Sinker,2011-04-30 02:25:00,8692,"Can you use braid, with a longer than normal leader?  I think I know what you want to do, but I'll wait until you say it to see if I'm right  S."
577867,mercman,2011-04-30 02:28:00,7054,wrong thread  
577871,GoneFishin,2011-04-30 02:37:00,349,My vote is for trilene sensation. I found it was the best all around line for center pinning and started running it in 10lb
577872,Sinker,2011-04-30 02:44:00,8692,"I have a reel spooled up with the sensation too, and also find it pretty good.  Have you tried Pline? I like the fluoroclear. Its only fluoro coated mono, but you get the best of both properties. I like it for certain applications, but never tried it in 20lb test, so can't say how it is. It is soft though, that's what I like about it, but you also get the abraision resistance, and lower stretch than straight mono.  S."
577873,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-30 02:54:00,10439," Possibly, but I will be fishing some skinny water at times and I think Fire Line Crystal would work but I'm not sure on the handling characteristics. Might be worth a try.  A friend of mine has a guide service down in Tampa and has been trying to get me to come down for a week or so of flats fishin' and I am going after 'poon and bones with a 10 wt spey conversion. It would be cool to get a slam on the pin too by adding a permit. Might have to see if I can get a red, trout and snook as well."
577880,Sinker,2011-04-30 03:15:00,8692,Giver!!  S.
577885,WeedLine,2011-04-30 03:25:00,322,"I 2nd what Sinker said about the Pline flouroclear. It's supple, strong, and abrasion resistant. Use it as a main line. It's flouro coated line. Good luck and catch some big ones"
