Roy, I missed you dearly this past year! I will hopefully be able to see you this year, if not, may have to make a special trip down on my days off for a visit!  Philly, I hope everything is going well with the fam!  Joey, I hope Paul is still taking good care of ya, and visa versa!  gbfisher, thanks for the invite. Increasing odds is probably all I'm good for, lol!  Ronnie, how irritating was that? I thought the damn van was never gonna move! But of course it would be wrong to speed...  Misfish, I heard Adam ran into you. Believe it or not I didn't get out onto the ice once this year. All work and no play makes Sandy a dull girl. All work and no play makes Sandy a dull girl. All work...  IrishWayne who?   Damn Bruins just scored!"
