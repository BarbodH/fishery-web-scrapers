576941,l2p,2011-04-28 00:47:00,346,"Thanks guys, the fire was an absolout must for sat mourning. By 4 am everything around us was soaked, good thing we had the fire going all night so it had really hot embers that dried the wet wood up nicely. I must say this opener was one of my better ones from past years, I just hope others can also say so."

577043,kemper,2011-04-28 03:21:00,2232,"Great pics bud, what a morning that was. Loosing count of fish is one thing, but loosing count of triple headers is a whole different ball game"
577265,l2p,2011-04-28 18:53:00,346,"Ahhh good good times indeed! The fish are definatly of bigger size this year, exactly what i was expecting after seeing the salmon and bows of the fall run."
