577200,krawler,2011-04-28 17:27:00,167,"Man are we getting a lot of rain this spring!!  Im trying to find a website that shows rainfall totals for various regions around ontario.  Id like to see rainfall totals each day if possible.  i dont know if this exists, does anyone know of such a website?  i know websites will show predicted rainfall amounts but want to know actual amounts.  The water levels on gbay are very low, each week i go up north i like to observe the levels and see if rainfall has any direct influence on water level.  I know we will need monsoon rainfalls to bring water levels back up and i know there are a list of other factors, snowfall, superior watershed, st clair river, etc.  any help would be great.  thanks"
