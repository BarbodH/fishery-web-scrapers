577073,fish_fishburn,2011-04-28 11:31:00,1311,Manitoubass you almost got it but when there in post spawn they can be very difficult to catch.  They are tired and beat up from spawning and the only way I can ever catch them consistently here in the river is with a dead sucker. No float just chuck it out and let it lay there. This will outfish a live sucker everytime. Like I said there very tired but they won't refuse a dead sucker laying on the bottom.
577136,manitoubass2,2011-04-28 14:03:00,11391," I'll give it a try, thanks again for the suggestions. Of course, I have to go catch a sucker now, lol.  Different gameplan today though. Head to the bay for some stugeon pics, then head up river to where a creek enters the main river. There is less current, mainly sand and mud bottom, shallow, from 1-9 ft deep. Lots of vegitation on the left side of the creek so this is where I'm going to start.  Now to start all over....  Why can't pike fishing be as easy as bass and walleye fishing???"
577156,Millhouse2020,2011-04-28 15:19:00,152,I would have to say I too would try fishing the minnow and bobber combo.  Never thought of a dead sucker on bottom but its worth a try.  I would imagine fishing from shore would make working lures in shallow water more difficult.  You can control the floats and position of the baits very precisely with a large slip float.  I like bobber fishing and slay smallmouth every summer with this technique.  Some people may think its childs play but its fun to see the bobber go down and its very effective when used properly.  I will keep an eye on this thread to see how you make out.  Good luck.
577174,manitoubass2,2011-04-28 16:01:00,11391," It does, but after years of fishing you learn where everything is, how the current and water levels effect the bait and it's presentation etc.  I do fish bobbers once in awhile though, let the current take the bait around the area I'm fishing, but thats usually when I'm busy making a fire of cooking or something.  I'm gonna try the sucker bait today, see how it goes."
577289,BillsTheBassMan,2011-04-28 19:30:00,932," Yeah, that was painful and my last sighting was with the topwater mouse when I pulled it away too early    He got spookier as the year went on and then it died and the season ended.  Hopefully this year I get him in and ideally a picture or two.  I've been back to check his home a few times before opener (to observe only) and once on opener (rivers blown) and saw something suspiciously similar in the same spot . . . nice to see he's still there.  It's safe to say that the hunt is on again . . .  As for your Pike, slow it down and see if that helps.  Try the sucker minnow, but give it a few whacks first to make it slower/dazed.  That could be the ticket.  I wouldn't spend a lot of time blazing spoons and spinners and fast presentations through their area at this time of year . . go slow or mid-range at the fastest.  One thing that often can work (and this is what LOTS of people told me about the big brown I'm chasing) is to try something completely outside the box.  For example, I caught a good brown last spring on a gulp fish fry grub and a orange jighead.  Sometimes it's just about throwing something at them that will peak their curiosity.  Best of luck and keep us posed."
576749,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 16:35:00,11391,"After a few days of watching pike in a local bay, and missing a few beauties, I'd be interested to see how the OFC'ers would approach this situation.  It's a shallow bay, varying between 3ft deep to 15 ft deep. On the left, we have some vegitation and rocks, mainly shallow, with a small amount of current.  To the right, we have a a slope, some overhanging trees, a tree half submerged, and a shallow sandbar to exit the bay. Current is a little heavier on this side, and is very close to a walleye spawning grounds.  To the center, a drop of from 4ft to 12ft, rock and pebble bottom.  Water levels are seasonably high, water is starting to clear, visibility is about 4-6 ft. Water temps are 43 degrees, slight wind from the west, south west.  I can see the fish, and many of them are feeding on or just below the surface. I've put in a good 10-12 hours on this spot in the past two days, and just can't get them to take. I've searched the whole water column with different techniques, different baits, different retrieve speeds etc. And so far, not much luck. A few 25""ers but I can see fish in the 40"" range, lol.  anyhow, any help is much appreciated  Submerged tree on the left side    said bay is in the backround, we take huge walleye right of this bay    Another beauty  "
576754,bigbuck,2011-04-27 16:42:00,2449,"Try a big sucker minnow 5-8 inches in length on a 3/0 or 4/0 hook and a bobber a few feet up. Toss in and wait. The early pike can be notorious for being finnicky and closed mouthed. Give it a shot, works like a charm for us in Muskoka for the opener."
576757,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 16:48:00,11391, Hmmm. I'll have to try that. Thanks for the input
576759,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 16:52:00,11391," No, I can't see what they are eating. It's either some type of beetle, or it's the baby frogs. It's hard to tell since I broke my polarized glasses the other day.  I actually did try some different jig/trailer combos yesterday. I was using Berkley craws black/red flake. Tried on a few different flippin jigs, black, black/green, black/blue, white/chart.  I also tossed some spinner baits with/without trailers. some 4ft and some 6-8ft cranks, some flat raps, live bait/jigs"
576760,ckrb2007,2011-04-27 17:00:00,449,"Blue Chrome suspending husky jerk has always been good to me when fishing for gators. ""jerk, jerk, pause........jerk, jerk, pause"" Hmmmmm...I really gotta think before I type! lol"
576761,tb4me,2011-04-27 17:00:00,3295,Id go with the minnow suckers and a bobber. They seem to work best for me in the early spring..I hope to test that theroy this weekend!!
576768,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 17:22:00,11391,"I also used some Gulp minnows on various jigs, chart. and minnow colors. I tried gulp minnows on floating jigs as well for the first time, the action was awesome, I couldn't believe they didn't want it.  The few decent ones came on flat rap firetiger, a shadalicious swimbait/jighead and a live minnow on a knuckle ball jig resting on bottom.  Today I'll try some new things, see what happens"
576771,Gregoire,2011-04-27 17:26:00,1397,Have you tried topwaters?
576772,Leecher,2011-04-27 17:29:00,7832,I would try a Jitterbug and Zara Spook    since none of the other lures worked    I'd even throught a red and white spoon
576773,Pikeslayer,2011-04-27 17:29:00,1443,Dead baiting is my go to for season opener.  Slayer.
576774,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 17:31:00,11391," Yes sir.  I tried a few frogs (although the water is cold). I see the frogs in the water so it was worth a try. I tried burning them in, tried a jerk/pause, jerk jerk pause, even popped the water, no takers.  I tried a few top water crawfish baits I have from Storm.  I used a clown subwalk which has worked great on other occasions.  I tried a few shallow cranks as well, 1-2ft"
576776,Harrison,2011-04-27 17:33:00,2202,"Just a heads up, if you try alot of different things you may just end up spooking them.  I like the slip float with a sucker myself, stealth can be key in these conditions."
576781,tipupesox,2011-04-27 17:51:00,167,"Try a jerk shad style plastic bait, Texas rigged.  You can work these baits high in the water column with a slow retrieve."
576783,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 17:56:00,11391," Yeah, for sure. Keep in mind this is over a period of a few days"
576791,Pikeslayer,2011-04-27 18:30:00,1443,"MB, I'd be careful about advice from competing team members . You never no who you can trust right? Looks like you're getting some good solid advice from your fellow team mates so you might want to ignore the other teams. Might just be 'misinformation' thrown out there to get you off your game (sorta what I posted). So now I feel genuinely guilty  . Seriously, there's no such thing as dead baiting. I just made that up in my head (I've never even caught a pike). Even if there was, it only works in England.  Good luck with all the other reliable suggestions. I'm sure one will work out for you. BTW, Leechman has no clue what he's talking about either. Right Jacques??  Regards, Perchslayer"
576792,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 18:32:00,11391, This is the best post of the day
576797,johnnyb,2011-04-27 18:37:00,3413,"LOL @ pike/perchslayer  Manitou....if the sucker option is an easy one, that'd be the #1 choice.  If that's too much hassle, then my #2 choice would be a super slow moving jerkbait.  Hard bait or soft plastic...either way...sinking/suspending is key....just twitch it in place and leave it there....and tell the wife to grab you a new pair of polarized lenses!!!"
576798,Pikeslayer,2011-04-27 18:38:00,1443,  Glad to see your taking it seriously.
576807,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 18:59:00,11391," lol, its a tourny. No different than the others I've fished in, lol.  Well, 2 hours before I head out, hopefully we can land some today. Weather kicked up pretty good, might be a good thing"
576809,GBW,2011-04-27 19:05:00,8460,don't forget these...  
576842,craigdritchie,2011-04-27 20:23:00,1586,"Uh huh!!  Pike in shallow water can be crazy spooky at times. Small, subtle stuff sometimes works best. Little jigs, or a little Mepps spinner, can work wonders when they ignore everything else. Fish as slowly as you can without hanging up.  Also try a wide, thin spoon that you can also work slowly. A smallish, thin-model Johnson Silver Minnow is good, or a Williams wobbler (change to a weedless hook if you need to)."
576865,manitoubass2,2011-04-27 21:16:00,11391,"Thanks for all the input OFC community, always appreciated.  I'm heading out in 30 minutes, and the wind has picked up considerably. We are now looking at a storm front moving in later tonight, so.... Might be a good thing, might be a bad thing.  But it's all apart of becoming a better pike angler, right? lol  I've landed lots of big pike before, but always either bass or walleye fishing. Whenever I target pike (which is rare until this year) I never seem to seal the deal on those darn toothies"
576868,Dozer,2011-04-27 21:24:00,896, x2!
576889,fishindude,2011-04-27 22:12:00,220,"x2 on the soft plastic jerkbait (Slug-go). I would deadstick it if there are no follows or else work it using a real slow retrieve with rod tip between 9 and 11 reeling in the slack. Work it back to the boat/shore. Also, if you aren't already, try fishing the north shore first as the water will be warmer and possibility of more active fish.  Cheers"
577054,manitoubass2,2011-04-28 04:41:00,11391,"husky jerks are hard to fish in this cross current area, so I don't use them there.  Anyhow, it was unproductive for pike. A bunch of sturgeon moved into the bay, which was still pretty fun to watch. Look like a bunch of 6 ft sharks swimmin around the shallows.  All I ended up doing is sitting and watching, never had a camera with me either. I'm going back tomorrow to try and get some good pics"
