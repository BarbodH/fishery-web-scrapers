Or i run around the house like an idoit looking for them like i just did."
577299,BillsTheBassMan,2011-04-28 19:56:00,932,Your boat license has to be the original.  I would assume the same rules apply to your fishing license.

577301,skeeter,2011-04-28 19:58:00,1907,They are both the same size as a credit card. Why not carry them in your wallet just like your bank card?
577303,raysfish2005,2011-04-28 20:02:00,163,LOL been there done that...plunk....What the Puck was that?....yep wallet in the drink as i put on my coat  I was thinking of putting a hole threw them or just keep them in the tackle box like i always do...

Get pulled over by a cop and he will want to see your actual driver's license - not a photocopy.  I'm not certain, but fairly sure that putting a hole through either one will void them."
577432,Dave Bailey,2011-04-29 00:28:00,1641,"I used to keep mine in my tackle box, unfortunately I once spilled some Muskol into the box and the next time I tried to take it out it was pretty well glued to the bottom.    Now it stays in my fishing vest, which I always wear when fishing, don't always have a tackle box."
577444,camillj,2011-04-29 00:45:00,1988,Mines right before my boaters card and right after my drivers licence in my wallet ... cant get there without it .. and dont want to get there without my fihing licence
577456,danbouck,2011-04-29 01:02:00,4380,I doubt it since you can print one off when you do it online
577544,dhickey,2011-04-29 05:44:00,1038,why not put a couple zip lock bags in your tackle boxes as well as any thing you take out fishing ? this way you put your wallet in one cell in one and if you drop it in the drink it floats for a few seconds. long enough to retrieve it. and ITS DRY. keep the photocopys at home this way you have proof of ownership.  thats what i do.  copyes dont count for squat when confronted buy authorities. but if you loose origonals copys do help speed up the proces of getting new ones.
