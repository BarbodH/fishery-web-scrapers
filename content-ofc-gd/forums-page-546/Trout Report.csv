I got out with Gone Fishin on opener nice and early in the rain and visited the creek again twice since then to try again but only caught 2 baby trout. I'm not buying any more hooks,pink worms, or floats so It's game over for the Spring.  Enjoy the pictures, had fun learning how to float fish with a 11' rod. The stradic fi got a good test drive on the river, couldn't be happier in it's performance!  Pictures Fish Number 1    Fish number 2  and my last of the spring...number 3   Thanks for looking,  MTBF"
576974,kuhaman,2011-04-28 01:41:00,503,Very nice!!! The fi is a great reel
577027,alphaalpha,2011-04-28 02:53:00,475,pink worms for the win!
577032,GBW,2011-04-28 03:04:00,8460,"Um, Mike, you know the combo of camo + orange the fish can see it right?      PS, that ""pool"" over your shoulder looks like it could take out the SS Minnow...  nice fish dude!"
577033,BillM,2011-04-28 03:06:00,17367,"There's like 6 inches of vis, those fish weren't seeing anything except for a pink worm smashing them in the face"
577271,BillsTheBassMan,2011-04-28 18:55:00,932,I recognize that body of water . . . it looks just like every river in my general area for the entire past week.  Tough opening stretch but you made out ok with a nice fish.  Thanks for sharing as always Mike.
577272,l2p,2011-04-28 18:56:00,346,"Nice fish bro, dont think of retiring the rainbow gear just yet. Plenty fish in the systems still!"
577419,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-29 00:07:00,3761,  Ya opener was murky but it cleared quickly when I caught the little fish...Prob why we only got 1 on opener
