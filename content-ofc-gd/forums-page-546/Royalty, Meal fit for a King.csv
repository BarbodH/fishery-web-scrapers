576893,misfish,2011-04-27 22:21:00,29133," Nuth,n like a bowl of mashed fish and fries in a bowl of malt."
576901,Live2fish85,2011-04-27 23:01:00,1633,"MMM that looks awesome Fish Hammer nothing like some Crispy Perch and fiddleheads, I havent had fiddleheads in awhile I am going to try and find some for myself."
576904,pics,2011-04-27 23:10:00,1268,Two jakes this morning for our group....
576931,Rattletrap2,2011-04-28 00:32:00,1652,How do you prepare the fiddleheads? I don't think I saw any around our place just yet...maybe soon though!
576935,Fisherman,2011-04-28 00:36:00,7201,"Rinse, and if you have a steamer that works well, shake of excess water,  plop of butter and a tiny shake of nutmeg. Or a covered glass bowl with fitted lid, 1/4 cup of water, on high for 3 mins, drain, plop of butter and a tiny shake of nutmeg."
577020,Nipfisher,2011-04-28 02:44:00,2449, Get the water to a good boil and drop them in. Don't walk away the take only a minute. Rinse off and add butter salt and pepper. MMmmmmmm.
577080,Bigworm,2011-04-28 11:55:00,119," I've eaten Fiddleheads since I was a kid but there has been some question surrounding the toxicity of them. It is recommended that they be cooked for 10 minutes and change the water once in between. Also, make sure they are Ostrich Ferns not Braken(not usually around here) as, the later has been linked to cancer. The affects are rare but include nausea, vommitting and diarrhea...nothing that will kill you, so enjoy! I will be picking some this weekend"
577081,Fish Farmer,2011-04-28 11:56:00,2234,"I just boil for a few Min's then drain, dump on plate then butter pepper and salt some people shake a little vinegar on top. After you pick them they are a pain to clean but well worth the work. Another thing it's hard to find a place to pick them close to Hamilton, most places are posted. I'll have to try the Nutmeg as fisherman suggested, sounds good. I have had them in a stir fry, and that was good."
577150,Live2fish85,2011-04-28 14:51:00,1633,"When I cook fiddleheads I boil them for a bit then throw them in a frying pan with some butter, garlic and pepper they taste amazing just not to much garlic as it takes away from the flavour of the fiddleheads."
577153,Spiel,2011-04-28 14:59:00,9065,  Nice! So you lost my phone number?
577360,crappieperchhunter,2011-04-28 22:05:00,2582,The fish looks awesome   But I've tried fiddleheads more then once and don't care for them. My asparagus pops up in the garden right around the same time as fiddleheads peek out and I enjoy it way more...so I'll leave the fiddleheads to those who appreciate them.
577389,misfish,2011-04-28 23:07:00,29133,"I have to say that fiddle heads are a great free veggie to those that are willing to get out and get them.I myself like them and like mentioned,fried in budder and garlic with pepper topped with a squezze of lemon. I recall being waken up by pop in the spring and saying,who wants to go fishing? We be gone for a few hours then it was the,see these,start pick,n boyz. It was just as fun as the fish,n, as we competed to see who could pick the most. Funny how it took til know ,to remember how much fun fiddle pick,n was.  Thanks FF  Memories"
577405,Rod Caster,2011-04-28 23:32:00,5784," I picked up a bunch in Barrie last year... Free and organic, you can't go wrong.  Nipfish..they should be sprouting next weekin our area...let's go get some!"
577499,Fish Farmer,2011-04-29 02:09:00,2234,"Your welcome Brian and thank you because your story almost reminds me about my pop taking me and my sister out Speckle fishin and my dad taking bags to pick fiddleheads on our walk in the bush. Thanks Brudder , nothin like memories"
