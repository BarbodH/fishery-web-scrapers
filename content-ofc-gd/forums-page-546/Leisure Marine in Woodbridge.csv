577161,BucktownAngler,2011-04-28 15:30:00,582,"Just wondering about Leisure Marine, if its a good reputable place.  Has anybody dealt with them before?"
577170,bigbuck,2011-04-28 15:51:00,2449,They've been around for a long time so I guess they can't be that bad.
577177,batoathome,2011-04-28 16:09:00,47,Purchased a few things there.  prices seem to be fair and YES they have been around a LONG time!
577287,Flappn,2011-04-28 19:25:00,245,My brother in-law bought a boat there and he is picky and cheap so I would say they must be ok. I 3rd the comment they have been there for a LONG time.
577291,Bigfisherman,2011-04-28 19:33:00,100,"I've bought some stuff from there(prop, seat base, oil & a few other small things) I was happy with their service."
577307,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-28 20:07:00,0,I bought an oil filter from them. Was the wrong one. Bought oil as well. Wasn't enough.
577309,ketchenany,2011-04-28 20:14:00,3229,"They have been there so long I remember when they had a dock!  I drive by at least two times a day and all I see is the boat up in the air, maybe the lake dropped too!"
577354,bassjnkie,2011-04-28 21:54:00,1101,"They been around forever. I always dealt with them for my first boat and with my current boat. Fair prices, very knowledgeable and really good service. A+."
577357,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-28 22:01:00,10439,"I have never dealt with them but incase you didn't know, they have been there a long time."
577367,marrex_mike,2011-04-28 22:21:00,40,"A friend of mine just went there and got a fish finder and trolling motor that he brought installed and they charged him almost $700 for the job and it was on a 14ft misty river! I think that was a little bit of a rip off... they said it's $100 per hour for service, I dont think that would have taken 7hrs. Has anyone else heard any bad things about them cause I was going to bring my boat there for service but now Im a little worried??"
577466,HTHM,2011-04-29 01:15:00,4082,"While i was restoring my ranger, they were a great source of advice, and let me know about a good deal on the motor I currently own. I would not hesitate to vouch for them."
