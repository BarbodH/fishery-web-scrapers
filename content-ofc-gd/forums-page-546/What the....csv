Still hasn't happened. I still have all my school engineering notes as well.. might need them someday you know..  Geoff... that licence plate has nothing to do with the boat, it belongs to you (and what ever trailer you register it to) period."
577458,GBW,2011-04-29 01:04:00,8460,"Thanks Wayne, and it's my dad's.  So I guess if I'm going to trailer this ""new to me"" boat around I'm going to need to register it and get hooped in 4 years.  CHEERS!"
577465,irishfield,2011-04-29 01:15:00,26272,"You don't need to register the boat Geoff if you're not gonna put more than a 9.9 on it. Keep a copy of the bill of sale in a zip lock bag in the boat and put the original one under your mattress. It shouldn't get too tattered there with the lack of activity.  As for the trailer.. if it's gonna be yours.. down to the MTO and get your own plate for $10 and pay the tax on the trailer or get a ""gift"" transfer from your father for free."
577470,GBW,2011-04-29 01:20:00,8460,  what's that song?  I think tonight's going to be a good night? Thanks again Wayne.  I don't know who is going to store the boat but I know I will use it on the trailer from time to time.
576907,Jer,2011-04-27 23:13:00,1426,   But it's still not funded by HST charged on used boat sales.
576919,Rizzo,2011-04-28 00:05:00,4754," same here. Just got my letter as well. When I registered my ""new"" boat almost 3 years ago I went with bill of sale and cheque in hand to pay the tax at the same time. The lady at the counter told me I could not pay her, I would get an invoice in the mail but it might take a couple of years...she was right, finally got it yesterday! Called the number to tell them I didn't know where I put the bill of sale, could they just assess me ""book value"" and I would be happy to pay it. Lady on phone told me just to write an explanation letter, indicate price I paid, and send a cheque. So my question is, do I pay just on the boat/motor or do I consider the value of the trailer as well? Although there are lots of sneaky ways to cheat the tax man on this (some mentioned in this thread!), I would like to be honest about it (call me a dying breed)!"
576927,Jer,2011-04-28 00:27:00,1426,  You will have paid tax on the trailer when you transferred ownership and received plates at the MTO office.
576929,Fisherman,2011-04-28 00:30:00,7201," Is the trailer registered?  If it is, then no, don't include the trailer, that tax was already paid when you plated it (although there are a lot of people that just shuffle the same plate from trailer to trailer without the paperwork). You get caught, it's your explanation to the fuzz.  Ah shinola, Jer beat me to it."
576933,danc,2011-04-28 00:34:00,4677,"You register your boat with the federal government and they do not collect provincial taxes for the provinces. You should have paid tax on your trailer when you registered and put plates on it. I got the dreaded ""prove that you paid the tax"" letter from the province three years after I bought my boat brand new from a dealership. The dealership had since gone out of business. I guess that if I could not come up with my bill of sale, I would have been on the hook for the provincial tax on 25 grand. Again. Something is definately not right here. And this has been going on for for at least two decades that I know of."
576946,Rizzo,2011-04-28 01:04:00,4754,"Thanks for the info. Pretty sure I just transferred my plates from the boat motor and trailer I sold. Sounds like I pay the tax on the boat/motor via the letter, then contact Ministry of transport to make sure the trailer is registered in my name and taxes paid on it. Man I'm glad I didn't have a cheque with me at work! I had already filled out the form with the full value on it including the trailer...OFC saves the day. I'll split the value up, probably call the trailer 1500.00 and the boat is the rest."
576988,Dara,2011-04-28 02:11:00,3052,"    Puulease  EI is totally self funded and excess funds are put into the general tax account.  I remember when the government put the country into a deep recession 20 or so years ago. Unemployment insurance as it was called then was going broke. The government cut the payouts drastically and increased the premiums, and changed the name to employment insurance..beats me as to why. After the country finally got back on its feet the plan was greatly in the black again, so much so that the government decided to rape it of its bankroll. Now, we are in a recession again and the plan is hurting a bit. They are talking raising premiums again and cutting benefits. If they put back the money they stole from it there would be plenty of funding.  Employees and employers pay into it. Many employers like it because it takes away the guilt of laying people off during slow times. When you retire you can collect the maximum just as if you were laid off, likely getting you close to even for all the years of paying in."
576991,Dara,2011-04-28 02:13:00,3052,Now on the the op topic.  15 years ago I got a boat....4 years ago I registered it because I was putting over a 9.9 hp on it. I got my tax notice today...freaking crooks
577024,Tootsie II,2011-04-28 02:49:00,162,"Bought a new ""tinney"" 3 years ago and the dealer told  me to make sure I held onto my bill of sale to prove I paid the taxes. Sounds like I better start looking for that bill!"
577034,Dara,2011-04-28 03:06:00,3052,"Our government is rediculous...they don't even know what people have paid tax on.  I can see on a private sale, but from a dealer...come on"
577040,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-28 03:18:00,4399," I can see less than honest dealers witholding the tax, many years ago I bought a car and also purchased an extended warranty long story short the dealer pocketed the cost of the warranty."
577047,zeeter,2011-04-28 03:44:00,92,"I got the same letter in the mail for I boat I had already sold to someone else.  I didn't pay and haven't heard or received anything else, yet !  That was last year."
577051,dhickey,2011-04-28 04:17:00,1038, this post realy has me wondering now. i must be a little rusty on the rules. so i have a 12ft with a 6 horse. bought 20yrs ago. does this need to be registerd? i do have my boating licence but i will be refreshing my memory.  as far as our goverment goes all departments are a JOKE!!! its been 8 months since my father passed and trying to get the death benifit that we are all entiteld to to help pay final expences for love ones has been a nitemare!  ok im done ranting now.
577070,Fisherman,2011-04-28 11:14:00,7201,"If you weren't a saltydawg and rather a freshwaterdawg, then you wouldn't be so rusty on the rules. Outboard size, over 9.9HP requires the vessel to be registered, doesn't matter if it's a 6' or 12' boat.  So, nno it doesn't need to be registered, but, if stopped, you still need proof of ownership, ie, a bill of sale from a dealer or private person."
577138,Dara,2011-04-28 14:12:00,3052,"  OK, maybe I'll try that. Its just that they give you 60 days to pay up or they say they will do their own estimate and you pay that plus interest.  These guys are such anal asses that they will hang you out to dry. We have had provincial tax auditors at work and they all write their own rules.  You can't have one show up and leave without fineing you for something and its generally for doing what the previous guy told you to do. You can't call them idiots or they will play god and nail you worse."
577344,Jigger,2011-04-28 21:30:00,1237,Thanks for the replies. Guess that settles it. I'll be posting in the what song are you listening to thread shortly
577349,GBW,2011-04-28 21:39:00,8460,"So what you are saying if I read this right, in about 4 years I may have to pay taxes on a boat from the 80's, 9.9 and trailer?  What do I need to do then selling my other boat?  Make a bill of sale saying traded boat for a bottle of Frank's red Hot so the buyer doesn't get hooped?"
577385,Jer,2011-04-28 22:59:00,1426,"   Basically, you're expected to pay tax on every single private sales transaction, somebody already mentioned garage sales, there's a tax base waiting to be pillaged by the tax man if they could only find a way.  The reason your forced to pay tax on used cars, boats, snowmobiles, etc. is because they need to be registered, leaving a paper trail for the bloodhounds to follow."
577399,Dean Ellison,2011-04-28 23:21:00,39,"Just recieved a letter the other day after 3 years. I mailed a receipt I had kept from the MTO (thankfully I never throw out anything Gov't) when I transfered the trailer ownership showing I paid $595, of which $560 was tax, based on the purchase price of $7000 (boat,motor,and trailer). I hope this satisfies their request"
577401,GBW,2011-04-28 23:23:00,8460,But I have a trailer plate for my current boat and the new to me boat has a 9.9 but I may put the 8 on it anyway.  So because the other boat trailer is no longer in use can I not use the plate that I have and there be no need to register?
577416,Fisherman,2011-04-29 00:04:00,7201," Just take the plate and registration to the licence office along with your bill of sale for the trailer, pay the man for the transfer, $10 and whatever the tax is.  If the boat remains powered under 10HP you don't need to register it, however, keep a copy of the bill of sale with you in a dry box. It's your proof of ownership for the boat.  Just like a safe boater course, I'm beginning to believe we need a How to Buy and Sell things course."
577420,GBW,2011-04-29 00:08:00,8460,"Thanks And I have never purchased a boat before so I didn't know, I'm selling my fathers boat for him."
577421,Handlebarz,2011-04-29 00:12:00,3790,KEEP YOUR RECEIPT  Yes I was yelling that as every time I have bought any boat I have had them (insert not nice word for government person here) send em a letter asking for my proof or else payagain I have been lucky to have had my receipts each time and make sure to keep my copy.
577422,irishfield,2011-04-29 00:16:00,26272,"I need to get one of you guys that don't have such an important bill around after only 4 years to come over and clean up my ""clutter"". You can start with the filing cabinet in the basement that still has my phone, natural gas, etc bills from my house in Milton (~1984).. and then work you way forward from there."
577448,Fisherman,2011-04-29 00:53:00,7201,"You think that's bad, I've got the original pamphlet, blower manual and engine manual from my Dads old '68 Ariens snowblower."
576499,Jigger,2011-04-26 21:55:00,1237,"Maybe 4 yrs ago, I bought a boat from a friend of mine. I registered the boat and have the ownership papers. Everything is tickety-boo.  Until today when I received a letter from the good ole Government of Ontario asking if I've paid sales tax on it and to please remit a cheque, thank-you very much.   Is this normal? Anyone else ever have to pay tax on a second-hand boat? And why wouldn't they advise me of this when I registered it at the Gov. office, 4YEARS ago?   Any replies would be great!  Edit: They aren't asking about a trailer. The tax ""owing"" is for the boat."
576505,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-26 22:02:00,4399,"Yes you pay tax on a used boat, you have the option of paying up front when you register the trailer or 4 years later or when ever they discover you did not pay!"
576507,GbayGiant,2011-04-26 22:05:00,1780,"Yeah I remember thinking the same thing ""why should I pay tax on a boat that was obviously bought new at one point and already taxed ? "" fun stuff."
576510,Jigger,2011-04-26 22:10:00,1237," I had a trailer. They didn't give me the option when I registered the boat and, like Gbay mentioned, why should we(me in this case) be paying a tax on something thats already been taxed?"
576515,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-26 22:17:00,4399,What are you guys new?  if you buy a used car do you not pay tax on it? if you buy a used house do you not pay tax on it?  Trust me Jigger your not the first guy that has had to pay tax on a used boat!
576517,Rod Caster,2011-04-26 22:19:00,5784," Same on a used car. Used to only pay GST i believe...but now the HST kicked that up a notch.  I feel for you Jigger, double taxing is illegal...yet they still do it.  but, please don't waste anymore of our taxpayer money by forcing them to send you another letter"
576527,SmokestackLightnin,2011-04-26 22:30:00,390, If you purchase a used house you pay Land Transfer Taxes not GST or HST unless it's a farm property or business.
576528,Terry,2011-04-26 22:34:00,14456,bottom line is  yes you have to pay if you didn't pay at the time you registered it
576531,grt1,2011-04-26 22:48:00,638,"same thing happened to me, I got 2 14 foot skiffs given to me by a camp owner, both were going to go to the dump but I got them, banged out the bumps , fixed the leaks, replaced the bench seats and transoms and they became serviceable for boat caches.  When I registered them I got my numbers and licence from customs and forgot all about them until the letter arrived wanting to knnow if i paid tax on one of them. So off I went and got a letter signed by the camp owner stating they were junk and headed for the dump so I didn't pay a cent for them.  I sent this in to the tax people and they replied that this was fine.  3 years sfter that I got another letter wanting tax on the other boat. was I ever pissed, obviously these guys don't keep up with the paper work when it's filed and then expect all the documentation produced at their timelines. So once again I sent in a copy of the letter to them and after being sent 2 reminders that I hadn't paid the tax on the boats and 2 more replies with copies of the letter from the camp owner, the tax guys dropped their request for the sales tax."
576533,craigdritchie,2011-04-26 22:52:00,1586,Pay them with used money.
576537,irishfield,2011-04-26 23:03:00,26272,"Since you bought the boat 4 years ago you only owe them PST if it's the Minister of Finance in Oshawa looking for their share. HST wasn't in effect 4 years ago...  It is mandated of all Transport Canada offices to submit monthly reports to the provincial government of ""property"" transfers. Then the slow wheel either decides to send out tax letters or not. Sometimes we get them on airplanes and sometimes we don't. I know one case of EIGHTEEN years later on an airplane that was won at the Elmvale Fall fair raffle.  With the boat... well it is what it is, but you only own them PST (8%) if it's from the Ontario Goverment.  Also remember bartering is legal in Canada... didn't you trade someone a pile of scrap metal for that boat? Just write same or similar on the form and send it back."
576539,Woodsman,2011-04-26 23:04:00,1286,What's even worse is when you pay the tax when you register the boat & 4 years later they send you a letter demanding you pay the tax. If I didn't still have the tax receipt I would be expected to pay a 2nd time. Keep your receipts. I'm glad I did.
576545,Fisherman,2011-04-26 23:16:00,7201,"Part of the issue that a lot don't understand is as follows: Registering a trailer with a boat and motor on it are different departments.  MTO(transport) is only interested in receiving the taxes due for the trailer, not boat/motor. They may forward the info(boat/motor) to revenue Ontario but that's about it.  Down the road,(many years sometimes) revenue Ontario with its molasses slow system gets to the bottom of the paper pile and sees taxes due on a used boat/motor(not yet paid). Again, Transport Canada, the entity that gives you the vessel licence or registration as may be doesn't care either, they're not there to collect taxes.  Therefore, best scenario, when you buy, barter, trade, are given a used boat/motor, get a receipt from the previous owner, separate from the trailer, go to the effort and get it paid up front. That way there are no ghosts in the closet to haunt you."
576551,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-26 23:24:00,4399,  I guess I should have spelled it out!!!
576559,gaspumper,2011-04-26 23:48:00,393,"Yes it happened to me a few years ago,only I had lost the bill of sale from the guy I had bought it from and he had passed away I could not prove it was a used boat so they charged me over $600.00 for taxes as if it were a new boat.No if ands or butts I had to pay it.They were going to garnishee my wages if I didn't."
576638,Jigger,2011-04-27 03:00:00,1237,"I'm really amazed the tax cops aren't out in full force at every garage sale from here to wawa. Or tracking Craigslist/kijii etc. Private sale should mean just that. I'm just fed up with this nonsense. Just filed my return the other day and had to pay back 30% of the EI I had to claim for going to trade school. Now this. Brutal...Guess I have to pay, but like I said  :wallbash:  :wallbash:"
576686,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-27 11:25:00,4399," Well the tax cops don`t have to be out there as you found out, and don`t worry there are plenty of ""private sales"" going on out there to feed the underground economy. You seem to have overlooked the fact that all these taxes that most of us pay help pay for things like your EI and your trade school!!!"
576694,Jer,2011-04-27 11:49:00,1426,"   Ya...it makes me feel all warm & fuzzy everytime I buy something, file my return, fart...  ...and EI is paid by my EI premiums, not by the taxes on my used boat."
576708,Dara,2011-04-27 12:56:00,3052,"Just pay the tax...how else will the free babysitting...errr..full day kindergarten, get paid for"
576745,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-27 16:27:00,4399, Yes I guess that 700 or so of yearly EI deductions pays for the 32 or so weeks of benefits plus the other programs that are made available to the unemployed and underemployed!!!  And I don`t know if I would complain about paying taxes if I was recieving benefits that those tax dollars help pay for!!!

576886,Jer,2011-04-27 22:10:00,1426,"   Well ya, it's called insurance. Just like my $500 a year in home insurance premiums entitles me to a claim worth hundreds of thousands of dollars if, God forbid, my house burns down.  I may be wrong, it happens once and a while, but I believe that EI benefits are completely funded by the EI premiums paid by all the working folk. I don't know if it's still the case, but it used to run a surplus."

576903,irishfield,2011-04-27 23:08:00,26272, And ya would be... your employer pays 1.4 x what you do on the workers behalf (for some reason) and the owners can't even claim EI when the place goes out of business. CPP gets matched dollar for dollar (employee and employer) and that fund is almost broke...
