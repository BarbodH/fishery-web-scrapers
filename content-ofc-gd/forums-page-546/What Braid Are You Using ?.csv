577025,GBW,2011-04-28 02:49:00,8460,"I have NEVER had a problem with Spiderwire Sealth braid, ever.  After 2 years of use, spool it from front to back on another reel and the part that hit's the water is just as new as the day you got it."
577471,tibbs,2011-04-29 01:21:00,650,I use the Berkley FireLine Braid.  Braid  It's the only braid I've ever used and its been great so far.
577475,GBW,2011-04-29 01:25:00,8460,"You may want to try a round braid then as you WILL get a better casting distance.  EDIT: sorry, I know the Crystal isn't round but the image of that looks round."
577487,Live2fish85,2011-04-29 01:44:00,1633,I use the Fireline Tracer braid for my finesse rod and I really think it's great I have had alot of luck with it. But I also use 6 lbs Flouro on that rod as well depends where I'm fishing and the conditions. I have never tried the Suffix but I have heard good things about it maybe I will give it a shot on my crankbait rod. I did have one problem with Fireline though I had two spools fray the first time I used them and after the second one I wrote to Berkley and within 2 weeks they had to spools sent to my door I thought they were only going to send one and to my surprise I got to. I'm not big into complaining but I don't like throwing 25 buck a spool away like that.

577518,Mike the Pike,2011-04-29 02:49:00,3421,For me I like Stren Super Braid and my latest favorite P-Line Braid.I no longer purchase power pro does not have the quality of these two brands.

577528,BFSC Kevin,2011-04-29 03:36:00,1351," I've tried spiderwire, power pro, fireline, stren super braid, and stren sonic braid. I like the stren super braid the most but they no longer make them  I did just purchase some of that suffix 832 stuff but I haven't spooled any of it yet."
577565,Mike the Pike,2011-04-29 12:29:00,3421, Hey Kevin didn't know it was discontued but still see plenty on the shelf here in QC.Give the P-Line braid a try its just like the Super Braid from Stren.  MTP
577593,PainInTheBass,2011-04-29 13:26:00,102,"I started with PowerPro, then tried Daiwa Samurai.  The Samurai is rounder, and much much softer than PowerPro.  It is also prone to wind knots, and I did not find it suitable for the rig I had it on.  I still use it, and have switched most of my PowerPro to Suffix Performance.  I was considering switching to 832, but thought they did not have a hi-vis colour.  If I can find some of that Neon-Green, I am gonna pick some up and give it a go."
577603,umKthxbye,2011-04-29 14:06:00,247,"You wont find the neon lime hi-vis anytime soon from what stores have been telling me. I had to get mine off eBay but the seller isn't there anymore sinse he had really cheap shipping. The other one ship for almost 20$  the hi-vis is amazing and so easy to see, i use a fluro leader. The 832 seems more abrasion resistant then my berkley fluro. If enough people are interested in hi-vis you can alway make a bulk order and save money that way, I've talked to a US supplier that would give a discount for bulk. I know ill be interested in some more of different poundage, i have 50LB right now but woul love some 8 for my spinning rod."
577605,umKthxbye,2011-04-29 14:12:00,247,Some one else is now selling the sufix 832 hi-vis neon lime on eBay for $37 +$3.99 shipping world wide. Seller is tackle_on_the_bay777 get it while the store is there.  Another eBay seller is millcreekoutlet ships for $4.02 and has a larger poundage option then the other one.
577679,Guest nuker,2011-04-29 17:44:00,0,"i picked up 4 spools of 832 when it was on sale at canadian tire.  have 3 spooled up already. also spooled up spiderwire stealth, fireline crystal, sufix fuse in blue,  and powepro in red.  all between 10-14 lb test.  the crystal i find wiry  out of the box, softens up after use, but frays pretty quick.  i'm ok with it.  the spiderwire is strange.  i find it gets thinner over time than when it's out of the box but it doesn't look like it's fraying.  i have it on 2 reels and same thing. strength doesn't seem to be affected.  but it slices the skin nicely.   the fuse, 832 and power pro are new to me this year so we'll see how that goes.  i have an ultra-light reel that has mono.  everything else i have is one of the above braided lines, some with mono/flouro leaders, depending on application.  I find the spiderwire the best value.  $12-$14 a spool vs $18+ for the others.  I'm starting to think the ""fused"" lines are pretty much the same.  Dyneema."

576364,4x4bassin,2011-04-26 16:00:00,1025,It's that time to start spooling up the reels and was just wondering what the majority here use for braid.I have tried fireline and didn't like it and so the last several years I have been using power pro which I like.I am hearing alot of good things about the new suffix braid and was thinking about switching from power pro to suffix. Has anyone here used suffix braid and what did you think about it ? Thanks
576366,GBW,2011-04-26 16:05:00,8460,there was a rather long post on the suffix 832 line not that long ago.  did you miss it? I'm using spiderwire and have been happy with it for years now.
576368,archie_james_c,2011-04-26 16:21:00,618,"I'm using suffix on one of my spools right now. At first I was pleased at how quiet and smooth it was. but after about a month or so the green coloring wore off just as much as normal braid.  After trying suffix, power pro, fireline tracer, fireline crystal fuse, spiderwire ez braid,and ugly braid, I'm likely to just buy whatever is on sale now. It's all stronger then you need, zero stretch and fairly abrasion resistant....go with whatever's on sale or just close your eyes and grab a spool"
576373,skeeter,2011-04-26 16:27:00,1907,"Like Geoff said about the suffix, but thats coming from a guy who uses 2LB leader.  I use power pro, but like the reviews from the guys here about the suffix 832. walmart has it for $19.96, Lebarons &19.18"
576375,ckrb2007,2011-04-26 16:28:00,449,"Been using power pro for years without any problems.....but just like anything, change can be a good thing. So this year I've spooled a few reels with Suffix 832. Plus, the 1/2 price sale at Canadian Tire a few weeks ago on the Suffix kinda helped with the decision to try change. lol"
576377,uglyfish,2011-04-26 16:36:00,981,"Spiderwire stealth. Best I've used so far. Tried many, wasn't happy with most, power pro was the worst I used. Haven't tried the suffix yet, may give it a shot this season"
576398,GBW,2011-04-26 17:11:00,8460,"hey now, I said I thought it was 2LB because how thin it was..."
576402,manitoubass2,2011-04-26 17:28:00,11391,"I've been using suffix 832 now for about 6 weeks on one rod. First up was 15lb, took me a few days to gather how nice it actually was, then had the wife go pick up some more. I forgot to tell her what test, lol, she returned home with 30lb, which is 8lb mono dia. I haven't lost a lure yet, and thats damn good for a month of continous use.  It's very quite through the guides, it casts maybe 2 metres shorter than the same rod set up I have with 8lb mono on it.  I haven't noticed any colour fade as of yet, but then again I'm not really all that concerned over the color.  I will more than likely use this line on some of my other set ups that currently have power pro and spiderwire camo braid.  Knot strength is great so far as well, no issues with fraying, the line sinks faster than other braids (although not quite like mono).  Over all I'd say give it a try, it's never stopped an angler before! lol"

576420,BillM,2011-04-26 17:58:00,17367,Fireline Crystal for the spinning rods and Suffix Performance braid on the baitcaster.  I did pick up some Suffix 832 which will find it's way onto my Calais this year..  Looking forward to it.  80lb PowerPro on the muskie rigg.

I think I was out 1 or 2 other times and the line has lost half of it's color...already.  Not impressed, will be putting power pro or possibly Suffix back on this summer."
576440,manitoubass2,2011-04-26 19:31:00,11391,"I put some 832 on my sons rod the other day as well. Helps me spend less time retying his line from snags/weeds, lol"

576570,Dutch,2011-04-27 00:27:00,831,"I've used power pro for years and haven't had any problems.  Tip for those of you that are losing their colour quickly.  Grab a Sharpie of your choice of colour and cut a slit in the tip, put your line in the slit and reel it through - line is like brand new and doesn't fade significantly.  You only have to do it with the last 10-20 feet as that's the only portion the fish see anyway."
576582,backbay,2011-04-27 00:42:00,773,"Power Pro and Spider Wire both, had tried Sufix Performance Fuse, but found it very thick, and very stiff. Will replace it with 832 for this weekend"

576647,Garry2Rs,2011-04-27 03:23:00,1425,"I have used most of the major brands. In ascending order I like Fireline Tracer, Powerpro Hollow Ace and the new Sufix 832 braids.  I have 40 pound Hollow Ace on most of my casting reels and 30 pound 832 on one reel for test purposes.  I still run Fluoro and Mono on a couple of casting reels for top-water's and deep diver's.  There is 10 pound 832 on all but one spinning reels.  That one still has Tracer braid in 15 pound test.  I still like the visibility of Tracer for Senko type worms."
576900,EC1,2011-04-27 22:55:00,930,"Has anyone out there been able to find the 832 in Neon Lime? That's the colour that I want most.  Anyways, Tuf-lineXP, Daiwa Samurai Braid(Very smooth, handles very well), Fireline Braid(Very smooth also, but is prone to wind knots), P-line Spectrex has been nice to me over the last few years. Spiderwire Invisibraid looks cool, but seems kind of thick, but handles ok....Tufline Duracast sucks."
577005,Garry2Rs,2011-04-28 02:23:00,1425,I had nothing but unexplained break-offs with Spiderwire Invisabraid. I returned what was left and Pure Fishing sent me another 300 yards...It was just as bad!!! I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy.
