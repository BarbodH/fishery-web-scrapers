My first question would be is this going to be a family trip or is this something that you are gonna do with a couple of buddies.  The Keys are the place to be if there are no kids involved, there are plenty of smaller ""resorts"" and fishing can be done literally off the beach!  Bonefish, permit, barracuda, snapper...the list goes on for inshore species.  Offshore there are dolphin, sailfish, tuna and even the odd marlin mixed in."
