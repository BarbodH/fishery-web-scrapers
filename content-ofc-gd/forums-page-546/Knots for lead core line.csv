Im spooling up 2 reels with braided backing line, then tying it to the lead core line to it.  The end of the lead core I usually tie a swivel on, and then my leader line. Problem is, is that I like a long leader, in which makes it a pain, when im trying to land a fish. Esp if Im alone in the boat. Any suggestions on what knot to use? I will be using heavy floro line or mono line. I have even thought about using heavy tapered fly fishing leaders. Thanks in advance"

Don't bother with a swivel at the end of the leadcore, tie your leader direct. This is also a good method for wire lines because your wire or leadcore are never exposed during storage and transporting. A great way to minimize kinks."
