620598,Waterfowlr,2011-09-12 14:20:00,19,"My buddies and our fathers do a fishing trip each summer, but would like to do a fly in next year.  Just wondering if anyone has done one or any recommendations.  Appreciate the advice.  "
620610,solopaddler,2011-09-12 14:41:00,8605,This question comes up pretty regularly. In order to answer it properly more info is needed.  1.Where are you coming from and how far are you willing to drive to get to the jump off point?  2.What's your budget? Prices vary wildly among outpost camps. There's also fly in lodges with both housekeeping and american plan packages.  3.What type of fish would you prefer to catch? Are numbers of fish more important to you or is catching trophy fish paramount?
620613,Waterfowlr,2011-09-12 14:49:00,19," Hey Solo:  Thanks for the reply.  At this point, it sound like we are willing to drive.  We are setting aside a day of driving if needed, but would prefer closer if something was pretty good!  I also believe we are looking for something that supplies meals included if possible, but we have done several trips where we cook our own also.  Just figure, if we are doing this...might as well do it right! Looking to catch lots of fish with the possibility of a trophy! Price...not sure what we are even talking yet.  We aren't rich...but know the cost is going to be high.  Thanks"
620637,solopaddler,2011-09-12 15:44:00,8605, So where are you coming from? What type of fish do you want to catch?
620665,adempsey,2011-09-12 17:11:00,1498,"I'd imagine any American Plan lodge that requires a flight out of Nakina, Hornepayne, White River, Wawa or Hawk Junction would suit your needs.   There are a bunch of them.  Air Ivanhoe also has one - they fly out of Ivanhoe lake, which is about 9 hours north of Toronto.  You might consider a boat-in option as well.   For example, there are several boat-in American Plan lodges on Lady Evelyn Lake that provide a really good alternative if you don't want to drive 12 hours [assuming you're coming from the GTA], but want that remote feeling.   Island 10 probably has the best rates of most AP lodges I have looked into (about $1150 per person, whereas most others are about $1400+ per person - albeit, they also include the flight).  There's also a boat-in on Ramsey Lake that provides the food, but you do the cooking.  Always thought that was an interesting idea."
620672,Waterfowlr,2011-09-12 17:32:00,19,"Thanks Fishlogic.  Sounds like a few good places to check out.  I am coming from the GTA area.  As for fish...walleye / Pike would be great....with some bass if possible.  No real set fish species we are after. Most trips seem to be pike, bass or walleye.  thanks   "
