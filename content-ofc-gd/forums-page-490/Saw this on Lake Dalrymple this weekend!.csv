621352,love2fishhave2work,2011-09-14 04:00:00,212," Wow, crossed the line. If you see a jaywalker, maybe you should just run him over.  Like I said before, to many people here take their fishing far to seriously, especially on a lake called Dalrymple which one could spit across.  Clearly you cannot read or you would have read that I have no cottage.  Maybe this guy who posted the sign has personal experience that not all fisherman like you profess to be are caring enough to remove a stranded hook."
621353,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-14 04:01:00,4399,"Dang I wish I was going to the park this weekend, could be some interesting crusing around Avery."
621355,love2fishhave2work,2011-09-14 04:05:00,212," Another winner.  Next time you take a picture of a pike, try to make sure it is bigger than the perch I caught last weekend."
621356,cram,2011-09-14 04:06:00,1733,"Landry - i said the sign is ridiculous. Maybe you can't read.  Not sure every cottage owner is wealthy, spoiled, and greedy; and/or deserves your ridicule, but whatever floats your boat bud."
621357,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-14 04:11:00,4399, Now that crossed the line!!!

621360,livinisfishin,2011-09-14 04:18:00,661, Ill keep that in mind!
621366,mbac31,2011-09-14 07:53:00,904,"Wow this is going to be a long winter.  Wether or not this guy is doing something illegal is something for the MNR/OPP or whomever but saying that the cottager might come down there or whatever can get you in alot more trouble. No need for that stuff to be said.  If the guy did something wrong then so be it, let the proper people fix it. Cottagers like to do stuff like this but stating that he is protecting his family might be the case and I as a parent feel for him  but does not give a individual the right to take the law in their own hands which is what this cottager is doing.  Ive ran into this before and most recently before I went on vacation. My daughter is 2  1/2 years old and we were out trying to catch panfish or rockbass on a small Kawartha lake. Mid week and one of these so called cottagers had something  done almost exactly like this with even more rope. I never even flipped his area but was going by it with the trolling motor, not worth the aggrivation. As I roll by with my bassboat, he comes out with a mouth I have only seen on my Uncle who is infact a former sailor. Even throwing crap. When I cant ignore you I take other means of action. Dont forget that im about 280 and 6'4"" but Im not going to beat the hell out of him, whats my daughter going to think.  I called the OPP and the Ministry. This clown was taking pictures of my boat with all the sponsors logos on it threatening he will ruin me, whatever this means.  OPP and the MNR show up and to keep a long story short. The stuff is removed now. He has a few court cases to deal with and the only thing I asked that he do was tell my little girl sorry. Now my daughter has a memory of this for a lifetime. I had to explain to her that not all people are like this and that this guy has been having a bad year and decided to tak e it out on someone. I did not even have him charged the authorities did, they could not even handle this fool.   That my friends is a disgrunteled human being that our world is full of.  Im not defending fishermen, we have just as many morons with fast boats that ack like these cottagers but thats life. I agree with a parent wanting to protect his or her children but I cant take the law into my own hands and place a speed bump outside my house to make the cars slow down.  If infact the guy has done a wrong doing he will have to correct it. I beleive he should be looked into because the biggest problem here is not the dock but that fact that if this is a government sign that has maybe been stolen, there maybe people fishing in a actuall sanctuary. If so, this is the reasoning for my thoughts that people need to think of the consaquences their actions have on other factors. Enough with the comments of who has the biggest weiner on the lake, were grown men here not children. Well most of us it seems.  And before the comments come out, I infact also have a cottage on a small secluded lake up north and the cottagers all ack the same on this lake except me. Owning a cottage does not give you the right to do this. The lakes are for everyone to enjoy. You will find people disrespecting land or whatever all over this country, deal with it. Tell you what, here is a neat little trick. If these cottagers are infact leaving hooks behind, then tell you cottager friend to but high quality nylon rope. Wrap it entirely around the lenght of his dock under the water line maybe twice for good measure. You will then have easy viewing of the lures and anglers will learn. I have it done to mine and im an angler, for that very reason because some guys just dont care. Problem solved.  to use the comments referring to whats going on in BC right now is very silly and not warrented. Because he has taken a picture does not mean that he will go and abduct his child, juvenille comment and you should know better to be honest."

That, plus, why would they put the sign on his dock?  Ah well.....I'm with Terry....we go flip his dock and see what he flips back"

621317,johnny,2011-09-14 01:59:00,4, I would be angry too if I saw some moron in a boat taking pictures of my stuff. You are definitely a very big loser mister.  Get a life!  This guy obviously has a family and judging by that slide there are kids around. I have a similar setup and find lures and hooks everywhere mostly stuck in little kids. This guy is protecting the children from YOUR lures. Move on! There are thousands of lakes out there and true fishermen catch in natural habitats anyways. Not under someone's dock. Your such a loser!

621325,2jack2,2011-09-14 02:28:00,92," Nothing wrong to protect your kids, but dont post fake sign, what if my little boy want to bike on the street outside of my house, should I put some fake road close sign on the street to prevent cars drive thu the street?"
621330,love2fishhave2work,2011-09-14 02:57:00,212,"First, I have no idea who this guy is and I don't own a cottage.  However, from my perspective, the guy clearly has kids and is trying to create a safe environment for them so they don't end up with your rusted hook lodged into their foot and an emergency run to the hospital.  To many of you are taking this way to seriously.  It is simply his way as a father to ask you not to throw sharp objects that can hurt his kids at his dock.  Seems logical to me.  While I love to fish like the next guy, as a dad, I have to respect his imagination to protect his family.  My guess is his dock is not the mecca honey hole on the lake that is worth this fuss and crazy debate leading to a call to the MNR. Maybe tomorrow you can report a jaywalker.  From my perspective, you have way to much time on your hands to cause this guy personal issues with the MNR and possibly police for simply trying to keep hooks out of his kids feet.  Furthermore, do you catch the news from BC lately.  If I saw someone taking pictures of my home who I did not know, again, as a father and all the crazy people that are out there, I would be pretty pissed as well.  From my perspective, your holier than though attitude just caused this guy a very significant headache.  But I guess from your perspective, you now have a honey hole to fish and if you are lucky you will catch one bass a year from under that dock.  So his personal headache that he will now need to deal with and possible fine must be worth at least one more fish for you this year."

621334,kickingfrog,2011-09-14 03:06:00,8333,Where is the line drawn then? Can I post my own speed limits on the street in front of my house?  Too far? Maybe I'll make my own speed bumps instead?  This is public water and this isn't an 1950's western movie.
621336,love2fishhave2work,2011-09-14 03:10:00,212,use common sense for the last two posts.  I am not saying that posting this sign is the right thing to do but reasonable people would look the other way on this one and the last two analogies are not the same.  You can't compare this to anything else.
621340,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-14 03:23:00,4399,"Is there a full moon tonite???  Keep putting stupid illegal signs up and I will continue to report it to the authorities,you gotta a problem with me drop by lot 47 at layzee acres!  Not this weekend though I won`t be there!"
621341,cram,2011-09-14 03:24:00,1733,"The sign is ridiculous, but i think some of you are way overboard.  It's clearly a swimming area for his kids.  Public water or not, the ministry does grant some latitude to cottage owners and docks (providing they are reasonable).  Also doesn't look like anything close to 100 feet to me."

621344,love2fishhave2work,2011-09-14 03:44:00,212,  Let him know that Mr. Sensitivity at 47 at layzee acres has a few pictures he may want back!

You crossed the line when you put a ""forged""/fake sign up - end of story!!!!! I would fish there just because of that sign. On the other hand - I would never fish a dock with people on or near it, nor would I ever leave a hook behind. Fact - you don't own the water and we all need to share and follow basic laws (like not putting illegal signs up) Take a hike!   "
621347,johnny,2011-09-14 03:52:00,4, I'd be afraid to be seen in layze acres. Hey maybe he could trade straight up for a house in Nunavit. Hear the fishing is great and no one posts any signs

This guy has a fishing net and a rod in a rod holder ready to go I guess he is allowed to fish in the ""spawning area""!  I was wondering if the MNR would be interested in knowing that people are borrowing their signs and using them?  The guy saw me taking pictures and came out of his cottage and he did look angry,I just left wasn`t really interest in getting into an argument! That`s a first for me I think!!! "

614200,nexstar,2011-08-22 02:07:00,63,i would give mnr and local by law office a call to see if his dock and sign is legal. He doesn't own the water.

On a related note, and this ties into a whole bunch of conversation threads that I've read here before, I came across this from the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act:  Section 38.  The ownership of the bed of a river, lake or navigable body of water does not give the owner the exclusive right to fish in the water that flows over the bed unless that right is granted by the Crown.  Take that for what you will."

My only real interest here is the sign, I doubt very much if this sign was placed there by the ministry.

614241,Terry,2011-08-22 09:40:00,14456,I would think roping off part of the lake would need a permit to be legal...think I will rope off cooks bay......if it's not illegal  and to post a sign would be 100% illegal if the MNR didn't post it  hey lets all go there this saturday and park our boats all around that area and flip his docks..which is not illegal

Would that be considered as an infraction, in the mnr's eyes? Im sure most of us wouldnt consider doing that, while crossing creeks, rivers etc. I did ask a close family members husband if there was any public access to the lake(they have a cottage there). The answer was a strict absolutely NOT! Now I do see the attitude that is there."
