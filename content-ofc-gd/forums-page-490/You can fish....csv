620360,irishfield,2011-09-11 21:17:00,26272,"Andy and Glen out hunting Muskies. Not hard picking out a boat identical to mine from 1000 feet AGL (okay 500) from amongst the armada out there today! After what I saw today, I know why I don't fish weekends!      "
620372,Terry,2011-09-11 21:59:00,14456,so did it freak out Andy when you came in for a landing towards him or was he feeling lucky
620373,irishfield,2011-09-11 22:02:00,26272,"They were feeling lucky, with cameras out and ready just in case! LOL Hoping glen got video of my fly by later in the day..."
620378,Terry,2011-09-11 22:23:00,14456,"So, did they do better then I did yesterday  0/0 was my score"
620379,cheaptackle,2011-09-11 22:24:00,849,But what did YOU see that made you glad you weren't fishing?????  Michael
620384,irishfield,2011-09-11 22:46:00,26272,6 million boats anchored.. moving.. etc on every piece of Muskie structure in the Sound. Bet Andy's arms are sore after that obstacle course!  They were battin a 1000 when I saw them Terry! (0/0)
620399,manjo39,2011-09-11 23:43:00,354,  If Musky is the fish of 1000 casts.  If there were at least 1000 boats then would one boat catch on the first cast or do all boats have to cast 1000 times?
620403,irishfield,2011-09-11 23:52:00,26272,"LOL.. none of those boats where fishing Muskie other than Andy and Glen. Just the summer folks that only venture out on nice days to burn gas and sunbath on their depreciating ""cottage""."
