If anyone has any insight as to picking Gores Landing or BoQ might be better shore fishing for walleye it would be greatly appreciated, or any areas for actual shore fishing on the BoQ for that matter, feel free to send me a PM.  Thanks in advance.  "

Don't give up...fishing with a lighted float and a minnow at night increases your chances as the walleye wont be anywhere near the shoreline during the day...they will come to the shallows to feed after dark though.  Good luck!"
621061,nexstar,2011-09-13 15:23:00,63,"wait for colder weather for shore walleye fishing and use a suspending lure and work it slowing at night time. if you fish at Gores landing, your best bet is when the north wind is blowing. Most of the walleye you will catch will be over the zone 17 slot limit in the fall, so if you are planning to keep the fish, go to BOQ based on the same method."
