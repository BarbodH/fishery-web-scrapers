621035,johnnyb,2011-09-13 14:08:00,3413,"Smallies and Lakers...very deep...steep drops...very clear.  20 years ago, it was a popular lake with the icefishing crowd, but  most people have given up on it....seemed to crash before the 5 laker limite was dropped to 2.  I've heard of decent smallmouth numbers....have never heard of anyone pulling lunkers out...I keep meaning to fish it as it's down the road from my parents....never do though.  "
621138,cityfisher,2011-09-13 18:25:00,959,fished it 3 times this year....couple smallies each time.. nothing over 3lbs.. most under a pound... Also caught one 4 lb trout on a white tube in 26ft of water.... Nice lake though  Hows the moose hunting in that area?
