I would love to get into some rainbow trout."
621446,torco,2011-09-14 14:50:00,656,Whats your exact route? My friends and I are doing at trip starting next friday at Harris Lake ending at Naiscoot Marina off of HWY 69.  From my understanding its more of a bass and pike area with some walleye. Haven't heard of any rainbows being caught. Anyways I would be happy to exchange notes before and after my trip next week.
