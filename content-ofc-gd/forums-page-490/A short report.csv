620419,danc,2011-09-12 00:41:00,4677,"My last Brook Trout outing of the year was a tough one. Bright sunny skies, 80f temperatures, barely a breath of wind, and water temps near 70f are all great for a lot of things, but not for Brook Trout fishing. In three days my two buddies and I had landed only 8 Trout. It was, however, great weather for watching Eagles. We saw about a dozen Balds around the lake in our outings.      Here's a few shots of some of the fish that we caught. Some pretty colors for sure.           And I found this guy wandering around the boat launch one day. It was my old buddy Moosebunk. I hadn't seen him for about 3 years now and we had a great reunion. Unfortunately timing didn't permit us to share a boat this weekend but he and his buddy Keith made it over to our campsite each evening for a few cocktails and some story telling. It was really great to see him once again.  "
620424,irishfield,2011-09-12 00:50:00,26272,"Gee... if I'd known there was gonna be a reunion I would have flown up!!      80 degrees.. what's with that, it was 34F in August in '08 !!"
620429,BillM,2011-09-12 01:09:00,17367,Awesome pics Dan!  Looks like all that crap weather just doesn't wanna leave!
620434,mercman,2011-09-12 01:14:00,7054,Great report Dan! I had trouble finding the fish this weekend too  Have to figure out the pattern for this time of year.
620437,johnnyb,2011-09-12 01:15:00,3413,Nice brookies!  Great scenery shots too
620438,Rod Caster,2011-09-12 01:21:00,5784,Fantastic weather this weekend... For people at least. I wonder if the specks were waiting for the full moon glow to start feeding. Pretty cool that you ran into Mr. Bunk.
620447,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-12 01:41:00,3761,"Nice collection of photo's, and great catches!  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"
620456,Joey,2011-09-12 01:59:00,9122,"Great report Dan, those are some amazing shots of the eagles and brookies.  Nice to see you got to spend some time with Drew for a bit"
620552,TennesseeGuy,2011-09-12 12:32:00,957,Getting out on the water is great.  It's not always about numbers.  Now to get ready for racin'.
620558,adempsey,2011-09-12 12:42:00,1498,"Some great photos there!  Regardless of the less than expected catches, it really looks like a nice area to spend time in."
620564,bucktail,2011-09-12 12:53:00,1857,"Always I wait for your report Dan in the fall! Beauty fish as always, did you guys get into any big gators or lakers?   Darren"
620578,Roy,2011-09-12 13:20:00,13728,"I always enjoy and look forward to your reports, Dan. This one is no exception. Such brilliant colours in your pics too. I'm sure lots of guys would trade any of their multi fish weekends for just one of those beauty specs. Thanks."
620583,solopaddler,2011-09-12 13:37:00,8605,"Awesome Dan. There's 3 days left though, plenty of time to squeeze in one more trip.  Lake trout should be on top of the shoals at months end, that would be a fun trip."
620609,Guidofisherman,2011-09-12 14:36:00,206,"Great report Dan. I also ran into Moosebunk on the water but didn't get a chance to meet and chat as I had to leave to deal with my dad's estate. Will be going back for the last few days of the brookie season though. I also ran into the hot weather and flat, warm water. Great photos, especially the eagles. How is that ""old bird"" sitting at the back of the boat?"
620631,ehg,2011-09-12 15:16:00,2666,"Great photos  Bald eagles, huge brook trout and great scenery, that area can't be beat.  Many thanks"
620900,Leecher,2011-09-13 02:15:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Dan Loved the closeup shot.... beauty colors for sure Thanks for sharing Jacques"
621086,Spiel,2011-09-13 16:44:00,9065,It's good to see a report from you Dan and good to know you got out before season end. Some great shots as always but I love this one......  
621117,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-13 17:53:00,65,"I must say these pictures are absolutely stunning, bravo!!!  Camera make/model?"
621121,ccmtcanada,2011-09-13 17:58:00,7971,I always love your brook trout reports!!!  One species I have never caught and they are incredible looking fish!  Awesome pictures as usual Dan!
621199,Whopper,2011-09-13 21:35:00,2174,Thanks for sharing Dan
621265,danc,2011-09-13 23:57:00,4677,"Thanks all for the comments guys.  Wayne. It wasn't a planned meeting. If it was you would have been the first to know. We knew each other would be there at the 11th hour. Next year sound good??  Rod Caster. My original plan was to fish through the full moon period. Saturday until Tuesday. I started work with a new company 2 months ago and couldn't swing the right days off. I like the way you think though.  TennesseeGuy. Can't wait for Kansas. I'm leaving 3 weeks from tomorrow.  Bucktail. I rarely target either. We can't help catching incidental Pike though. We landed a few, and lost a bunch. Biggest was about 15 lbs. We might have lost a few bigger ones but never got a look at them.  Roy. Thanks Bud. You put what I have up here into perspective.  Solo. No late month Laker fishing for me. I'm not sure if they'll be up in the shallows by then with the weather we've been having lately anyways. Besides, I'll be either in Red Lake, Dryden or Kansas during the next 10 months or so. I just don't have the time.  Guidofisherman. The ""old bird"" is just fine. He ages just like a tree, except instead of getting a new ring in his trunk each year, he gets a new chin. They're starting to add up now.  Spiel. Thanks Bud. Next year though c'mon down and get your own photos. You know where I live.  MichaelAngelo. I used an Olympus E-620 with a 14-42mm lens for the fish shots and a 70-300mm lens for the bird shots. Thanks!!  And thanks again to the rest of you guys for the nice comments."
621292,MJL,2011-09-14 00:40:00,2427, Me too...I really like that pic...Quite possibly my favourite pic of the year so far
621464,Moosebunk,2011-09-14 15:54:00,3970,"  Well bud, the weather did change and we got cut short two days this year because of 25-30 knot winds, all day rains, thunderstorms forecasted and a plumetting temps.  But the five days we did get... GREAT.  Couldn't complain about the blue skies, high heat, nada winds and hot water for living with... but it did mean extra work for specks.  It was fantastic seeing ya again, and meeting the guys was a real treat.  What a bunch of fun you all are, and SERIOUS about specks too.  It was our pleasure stopping in a few times to share a laugh and some malt with ya'll.  Solid short report Dan.  Incredible pics as always.  Condolences to you as well Al."
621465,Terry,2011-09-14 16:01:00,14456,pretty looking fish  I have never caught one any where that size...
621543,Ron,2011-09-14 20:49:00,1683,"Another year gone by. Nice photo ops Dan. I didn't make it up this Fall for the closing of the season, seemed like it would have been similar to what we had last year weather wise. (90 km winds = not fun and broken tents).  We found this Spring to be colder than normal making it difficult to locate the larger Brookies. We had no problem finding the small guys (>22 inches) but only managed 2 over the magic mark.  Cheers, Ron..."
