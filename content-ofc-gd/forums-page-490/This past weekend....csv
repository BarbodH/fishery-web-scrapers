He wanted to go fishing, so we hit the shoreline various times during the weekend. It's just the start of shiners running into the Rainy River from LOTW and Rainy Lake, and this means walleye start moving back into the river. Despite some really horrible conditions, we figured them out pretty good, and the kiddos had a blast .  The water level is still really low, and the water temps changed by about 10 degrees, fluctuating up and down throughout the days, which can make things very tough. The all start bait of the weekend was Yum pink/white grubs on jig heads, cast into the current and burned back. No other methods produced fish, no other baits either, with a few exceptions (black grubs on jigs, and minnows on jigs).  We caught a good 60-70 fish, mostly walleye. All were dinks though, the biggest was maybe 15"", the smallest being about 6"". We kept enough for a family feed, the rest were released to fight another day.  Campfire hotdogs, frog catching, crawfish hunting etc all filled an adventurous weekend with my children, followed by some homemade pizza/breadsticks, and of course a fish fry. We ate good, had alot of fun, and were all reminded how much we have to be thankful for .  I actually had to thank my son for making my weekend so memorable, lol, thats pretty cool if you ask me!  Fish food   Gotta be comfy to fish!     Eagles celebrated with us!   Rare catch   A giant! lol, held out and still small.   Caught fish like this all weekend       admiring the catch, as a team!    Maybe you can join us next year my girl, lol   Hope you enjoy!!!"
