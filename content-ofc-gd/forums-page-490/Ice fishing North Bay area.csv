621082,KMcD,2011-09-13 16:32:00,3,I have ice fished on nippissing for years and the fishing has been getting worse every year. We are looking for a change. Anybody who has some insight on a lake within 100 miles of Nippissing and maybe a lodge that takes good care I'd you. (rides in and out holes drilled etc.) I would appreciate your input. We are looking for walleye pike perch not really fans of trout fishing. Thanks for any info.

Considered it for my last trip, but decided on somewhere else.  Everett's Northern Excursions Lakeside Cottage (sleeps 7 On Ice bungalows Everett Grawbarger 705-729-1059  I think Martin's Camp also rents huts, or at least used to.  Wish I had some more personal experience to share with you, but I primarily ice fish on Lake Simcoe. I do try to take an annual weekend trip to a different lake each season, but have not yet ventured to the Nippissing area for ice fishing.  Good luck!"
621190,KMcD,2011-09-13 21:18:00,3,Thanks guys. This is also an annual trip for family and a few buddies. Just wanted to try somewhere new this year. Any more info anyone has to share would be great. I'll look into some of the above.
