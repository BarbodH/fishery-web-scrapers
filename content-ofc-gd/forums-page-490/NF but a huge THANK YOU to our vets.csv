My Uncle Leo Cleary served Canada in WWII he has not shared many stories with the family but he has spoken to Canada to share a couple of them. This site is amazing as you can read and listen to the stories of our troops who have given us the freedom to have the great life we have here in Canada.  Thank You to all our vets here is the link to Charles Leo Cleary http://www.thememoryproject.com/Stories/Veteran-Profile.aspx?itemid=3743

I have bought him a few more coffees then I can remember and say,THANK YOU all the time. I get a THANK YOU BACK. Brings a warm feeling I must say.Never really chatted,just feel this is the least I can do.I really want to talk to him,but not sure how to aprouch that.  Your uncle has done a great thing Mike."

Brian I bet it means alot to him that some one is paying attention. I hope others take a look at this site just to reflect on where we came from.
