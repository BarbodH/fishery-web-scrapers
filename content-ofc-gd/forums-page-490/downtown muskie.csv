620820,ehg,2011-09-12 23:39:00,2666,Nicely marked fish. You would think it would be tough fishing there with all the activity around.

620852,Rizzo,2011-09-13 01:05:00,4754,"I actually hooked a musky just off the cemetery the time I was there, of course I start hooting and hollering, trash talking my partner, fish flying through the air while we cheer it on etc etc... and then some bagpipes start to play!!! There was a group of about 5 people having a ceremony with an urn about 75 feet away, hidden to our view by a tree! Man was that ever embarrassing. I hope the deceased like fishing, then the family might have gotten a kick out of us celebrating."
