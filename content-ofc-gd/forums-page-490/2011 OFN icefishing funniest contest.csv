Our Boss T.J  and the admins, allowed me to do this again this year Last years contest was extremely fun for both I and my girls. And Im sure for many others here. I want to do this again this year, and with as much or more fun and pics to be added.  If anyone would like to donate a prize, that would be apreciated. All you need to do is pm me.  This is only for fun and for all to enjoy, laugh etc. I will have a prize package ready, and if anyone wishs to donate something. I may be able to swing a 2nd or 3rd prize. My Girls will be the judges again, and it will be their say  This is just a heads up for all here, theres plenty of soft water to be had in the meantime. I will post again/bump as a reminder or if donations have been made, etc.  Our last years winner was Irishfield Donaters where, myself, my kids, Bigugli and snapon tools Who will be this years winner/winners Good luck to all  "
