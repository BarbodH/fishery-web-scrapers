620332,rob v,2011-09-11 19:03:00,535,I've got a week of vacation the first week in October with nothing planned and was thinking of spending a few days fishing Rice - I haven't been to Rice lake in years and would like to give it a try. I'm by myself and I'm looking for cheap accommodations for a  couple of nites  - thinking perhaps a motel of some sort (renting a cabin from an outfitter would be too expensive).   Any recommendations  on places to stay near Rice lake ? Thanks

621170,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 20:07:00,130,hillside camp It is on the water and October will be a slow season for them (IDK about duck hunting season) so you can ask or get a discount.
621373,blue pickeral,2011-09-14 10:37:00,267,Have found that 'cheap' motels don't exist much below $100 / night these days. You might consider checking the off season prices on a few weekly rentals at lodges/resorts.  Rainbow cabins are on Otonobee River close to the its mouth on Rice Lake...being on river might give some shelter on a blustery day.  http://www.internetsportshow.com/searchit/rainbowcottagesresor.htm
