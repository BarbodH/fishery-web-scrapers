621043,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 14:18:00,130,I need a trolling plate sometimes and I think there are times when I definitely do not want a trolling plate.  So lets say that in the morning I want to troll but in the afternoons I want to switch it up and fish slop and weeds with frog. Wouldn't a trolling plate be a weed magnet? Is there one that comes off easily?
621049,Roy,2011-09-13 14:38:00,13728,What type of motor do you have and what trolling speeds are you getting now? What speed are you looking for?
621053,fishindevil,2011-09-13 14:41:00,6254,"check out the happy troller plate,its what i have and it moves up and down,locking into place when not in use,never causes me an issue...it is spring conrolled...."
621064,mike rousseau,2011-09-13 15:28:00,4661,Drag a drift sock or bucket...
621067,JTorra,2011-09-13 15:31:00,50,I just installed these....  http://www.nauticusinc.com/nauticus_pro_troller.html  I went from 2.5 mph to 1.7mph at idle. Also had some other benefits such as reduced porpoising and faster planing.
621073,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 15:46:00,130,60HP and getting 3mph  -i tried using my drift socks but it was a total pain and it felt like they would break any minute. -mounted trolling plates would be good but cost dollars. may as well bring extra batteries for the electric  looking for 1.5mph and less
621094,Roy,2011-09-13 17:10:00,13728,"Personally, I don't like trolling plates. A lot of people DO like them but I don't. I don't like drilling holes in my motors. If most of your fishing time is spent trolling and you only need to slow down by 1 or 2 mph, consider changing props instead. For example if you can get down to 3mph on your 60hp with a 3 blade prop, a four blade will drop you to around 2.2 and a 5 blade down to 1.5. You'll improve your hole shot but sacrifice a mile or two per hour at top end. You'll also be getting a spare prop out of the deal. Just something to think about."
621096,Billy Bob,2011-09-13 17:23:00,5865,"Trolling plates are trouble....the one that lock down can cause problems if you forget to raise it....the spring loaded ones that raise by themselves while going fast are in the way while trying to use reverse...  Muskie Mike had it right......a wind sock or 5 gallon bucket...if you use a bucket drill holes in the bucket and attach a rope as the handle will rip off....Wind sock is best IMHO..  Good Luck with your choice, Bob"
621100,BillM,2011-09-13 17:28:00,17367," It doesn't get much simpler then this..  Never had an issue with it, boat trolls down to nothing when it's down.  So much easier then using a bucket or drift sock.  One pull of the cord while in reverse it's down, one pull of the cord while going forward and it locks in place out of the way.  "
621106,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 17:38:00,130,How about weeds on the trolling plate? Do they become a problem when it is up?
621108,lew,2011-09-13 17:41:00,12766,My last boat had a 90 HP Merc and I used the same troll plate that Bill shows in his picture above.  It worked great and never any worries or hassles of bucket or drift sock ropes getting tangled with fishing gear in the dark.  Slowed my boat down to almost stopped.
621132,Raf,2011-09-13 18:08:00,3495,just buy a yammy with the troll assist  my 40 gets my 14.5 down to a C-R-A-W-L.
621135,BillM,2011-09-13 18:17:00,17367, Never had an issue with weeds.
621149,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 19:06:00,130,OK. I am going to give one of those spring ones a shot but will put a string on it so I can manually keep it up for reverse (save the laughter : )). A happy troller would be nicer but I wont be able to get one locally quickly or cheaply. have access to $60 spring loaded one.  Drilling 4 mounting holes in the motor  and it will be over. Like tearing off a band-aid drilling the holes will hurt when I do it.  I have to drill holes for a plate right?
621236,BillM,2011-09-13 22:42:00,17367,"Yup, you gotta drill holes.  It's really not a big deal"
