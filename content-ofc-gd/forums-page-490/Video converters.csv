621244,Skud,2011-09-13 23:09:00,739,Bought myself a Panasonic camcorder (HDC-TM700) for my fishing/hunting trips this month. I was just out at Eddie Norths and I got some great footage. My camera saves the videos in a MTS file. I would like to know a good program to covert these files into a mpeg or avi file. A video editor would be great too. What do you folks suggest?

621251,Miracon,2011-09-13 23:38:00,200,  Here is a great free one...  Any Video Converter  And a great cheap paid one...  AVS Video Converter  Hope that helps!
621259,adolson,2011-09-13 23:46:00,783,"I use ffmpeg to convert videos, and I know it supports MTS. I run Linux, but I'm sure there's a Windows port by now... It's probably command-line though, so it may be intimidating.  I also use Avidemux as a GUI tool, and I know there's a Windows version, but I'm unsure if it can read MTS files."
