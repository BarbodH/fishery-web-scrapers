How are people preparing, cleared shooting lanes on Saturday and spent sunday in bed paying for it.    I am on a great farm with deer from yearlings to a deer I  saw just south of the property that was about 210 non typical.   This is the best one I have seen there, hope he made it to this year cuz he is going to be an awesome 5 year old    "
