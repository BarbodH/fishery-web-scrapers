You can look up lakes and it will tell you what spieces are in it, regulations for that lake and people can post hot spots and post reports on the lake.  The best part is if your going to a cottage and you know that lake does not have the spieces you want to fish for the app will tell you the closest lakes that do and give you directions through google maps"
