620612,ehg,2011-09-12 14:45:00,2666,My buddy caught this musky at Pigeon Lake. What length do you think it is?  
620615,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 14:51:00,4661,How big is your friend?  Lol  Seriously... I'm 6 foot 4 inches 275lbs... So my fish look smaller in pics...

620619,Harrison,2011-09-12 14:56:00,2202,Tip of finger to first knuckle is about an inch.
620625,Rizzo,2011-09-12 15:06:00,4754,"It seems to me that every musky in Pigeon lake is that size, approx 40 inches. Every time I go to Pigeon we get one that's a carbon copy of that fish, can't seem to find the big ones yet."

620801,davey buoy,2011-09-12 22:48:00,5505,40 something?Nice one.
620804,ehg,2011-09-12 22:58:00,2666,"Seems like a lot of muskies posted recently are measured long. This one i measured at 35"". Thanks for your generous estimates however."
620810,tb4me,2011-09-12 23:10:00,3295,and your asking fishermen? lol I have been trying to convince my wife for many years 7 inches is actually 12...
620814,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 23:18:00,4661,  That's a good picture on a thick 35 ...
620819,ehg,2011-09-12 23:36:00,2666,"Dude is a powerlifter/bodybuilder so he is thick around as well. Caught this thick 43"" a couple of years ago, it is hard to estimate length of muskies from pictures.     Both were caught suspended over deep open water resulting in nice silvery, clear colouring. Cheers!"
620826,mistaredone,2011-09-13 00:07:00,913,"Yeah, I would of said mid 30's.  Your arms are extended toward the camera to make it look like a 40's fish.  When I take a newbie out I get them to do that pose.  Helps thier memories tell a good fishing story."
620829,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 00:15:00,130,Big enough for you to get a ruler on the boat. badda bump chhhhh
620896,Leecher,2011-09-13 02:08:00,7832,"Since you already gave the answer Erik... was going to give it a good 45"" Picture perception is deceiving sometimes"
