Markus was eager to cast a line, so I rigged up a slip-float and worm and away he went working the shorline.  Lots of Sunfish to keep things interesting on this day.  After hooking into a pile of sunfish, I thought we should move along to another location to see if any other fish were lurking about.  A tug on the line and Markus brings in his first bass.   Proving it was no fluke, he hooked into another bass shortly after his first.  I sure had a great time with my new fishing buddy.  And I learned a lot on that day too.  For instance, did you know the fish bite turns on when you repeat; ""Here fishy fishy fishy.""  It's a great new pattern I'm gonna use!"

620432,johnnyb,2011-09-12 01:11:00,3413,Great report -- fine young fisherman there
620910,Leecher,2011-09-13 02:27:00,7832,Great report Mike That's a million dollar smile right there
620913,ccmtcanada,2011-09-13 02:38:00,7971,"Great report!  He has the classic bass hold down already!  My little one says ""here fishy fishy fishy"" as well and she always schools me!  She sometimes adds ""I'll put you back and you get a free worm!"" Lol.  The smiles say it all...love these kinds of reports!"
620956,Mike Pike,2011-09-13 10:56:00,1332,"Thanks everyone!  Ya, it's funny, we've all caught our share of fish and still get excited about it.  But now I find I get even more excited getting a little fisherman into some fish!  I honestly don't know which one of us ends up having more fun!"
621071,bigbuck,2011-09-13 15:38:00,2449,I love taking kids fishing!!! The giggles and squeals of delight when they land a fish are worth the baiting of hooks and performing surgery on sunfish that deep hook themselves.
621075,NAW,2011-09-13 15:57:00,4022,Great report Mike!  Get em hooked young eh!
