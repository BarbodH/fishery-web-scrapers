Here has been my night: Nothing, nothing, nothing followed by nothing ... Then WHAM! Huge 20incher. Hahaha biggest one for me, looks like a simcoe specimen. That was 3 mins ago, sorry no pics. Vertical jigging is now my favorite bass technique"
620853,Rizzo,2011-09-13 01:07:00,4754,haha good for you! Sometimes its those nothing nothing nothing days that the big one finally shows up to change the worst day ever to the best!
620858,mercman,2011-09-13 01:12:00,7054,No Pics???? Didn't happen  JK Chad......Congrats
620861,Leecher,2011-09-13 01:21:00,7832,"Awesome Mr. Chad Taken 'er easy means, you forgot your tournament sign.... say it ain't so Congrats on your PB"

620885,Rod Caster,2011-09-13 01:51:00,5784," My puppy also ran away today.  Hahaha that's that then! I should make t-shirts for team 8 with the tourny logo printed on the front... ONLY team 8, the ASSASSASSIN8ORS!!! Wow, that sounds terrible with the extra a..."
