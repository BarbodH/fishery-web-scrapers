620418,manjo39,2011-09-12 00:39:00,354,Can anyone recommend a rod (preferrably 7') light action with a sensitive tip.  Want to be able to feel the panfish nibble my bait with no float.
620421,Bondar,2011-09-12 00:43:00,817,Loomis IMX  Sr842-2   -  7'  
620422,manjo39,2011-09-12 00:47:00,354,  I agree.  My float rod is an IMX and none of my other rods come close to it. I should have specified that I don't want to break the bank on this light action rod.
620453,EC1,2011-09-12 01:55:00,930,"Budget rods around $50 in a light action rod are usually terrible. They tend to twist and torque when you've got a bigger fish on and they're not very sensitive. In the end, it really depends on how much you want to spend.  I have used a friend's Shimano Convergence 5'6UL which I did like though.  I've held a friend's st croix premier and thought that was Great!"
620458,danbouck,2011-09-12 01:59:00,4380,There's a st croix in the classifieds
620592,manjo39,2011-09-12 14:06:00,354, Was thinking of the Bass Pro Micro Lites.  Will also check out the Shimano's.
620597,Waterfowlr,2011-09-12 14:16:00,19,  I have to agree the St. Croix's are great.  I got a great one on Kijiji Toronto.
620608,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-12 14:33:00,2690,"Used a 5 1/2 foot BPS graphite series for perch yesterday.  Light action rod with a fast tip.  Felt every little tap, could tell as soon as my minnow was missing.  Not as long as what your looking for, but, for the first time out for perch this year...I was impressed.  Plus the price was right, $30 on sale when I bought it."
620676,manjo39,2011-09-12 17:36:00,354,"  Is this the series you are referring to? http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Micro-Lite-Graphite-Spinning-Rods/product/10204875/-1645729   If not, can you send me the link if its not to much trouble.  Want to make sure we are talking about the same thing.  This is what I was considering in a 7'.  I could wait until they go on sale if you got it for $30.00  Also wanted to see what other recommendations were out there."

Good Luck on your choice, Bob"
620714,manjo39,2011-09-12 18:53:00,354,  That was my reasoning on wanting a 7' rod.  Better castability.
620722,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-12 19:20:00,2690,"  Actually was this one, regular price in the US is only $34.99.  More than sensitive enough for panfish.  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Graphite-Series-Spinning-Rods/product/44306/-948567  If you really want to spend more money, or can afford to, then for sure the St Croix's are beautiful.  I just can't justify the cost for a perch/panfish rod."
620724,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-12 19:23:00,2690,"  Good points Bob, however, for the panfishing I do...pretty much 100% LPB on Erie...there is almost no casting involved, and I am fishing 4-8 feet of water.  So the 5 1/2 foot light is perfect."
620739,landry,2011-09-12 20:08:00,1005,"There is a ML 6'8"" BassPro Carbonlite rod that is really nice IMO. Crazy light"
620786,TJQ,2011-09-12 22:11:00,7806,I hae ve two of the bass pro microlites .. and i lovem.
620806,manjo39,2011-09-12 22:59:00,354, I agree.  I can't justify the cost for panfish either.
620851,bare foot wader,2011-09-13 01:05:00,1354,"http://www.rapala.ca/products/rapala/F2.php  i've had one for past 2 summers, it can toss spoons a good distance and enough backbone to land 5 lb rainbows, sensitive jigging for walleye...great action but not exactly a loomis...about 80"
620906,thalweg,2011-09-13 02:19:00,112,Can't beat Dobyns rods. Not the cheapest but awesome build quality for the price.
