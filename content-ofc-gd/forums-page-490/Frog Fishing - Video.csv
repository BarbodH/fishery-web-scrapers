620988,EC1,2011-09-13 12:30:00,930,Good stuff! I love frogging videos!
620992,johnnyb,2011-09-13 12:39:00,3413,Nice!  That fish absolutely swallowed the thing!
621007,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-13 13:01:00,3761,"Nice bass man, definitely  inspired to start making vids next summer...very cool"
621092,JustinHoffman,2011-09-13 17:05:00,482,"@ Mike - Definitely give it a try. Fun to make and cool to relive the action once again. Unfortunately, the fish can be camera-shy from time to time, ha ha!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
621095,Terry,2011-09-13 17:16:00,14456,another good video  and I need to get out and throw a frog
621113,206,2011-09-13 17:46:00,563,Great job....What kinda scale is that? love the lip clamp instead of the ol slip under gill style!  also had to chuckle when the blackberry chimed at :51 make i actually thought it was my own going off here
621125,JustinHoffman,2011-09-13 18:00:00,482,"@ 206 - It is the 15lb Rapala Touch-Screen Digital Scale:  http://www.rapala.com/products/tools/touch_screen_scale/  Love the clamp, also - much better than the hook. (Although the package does come with both.) Accuracy is to +/- 1 ounce. Keeps track of your fish, also.  Ha ha - yep, forgot to put the BB on silent. Good thing I didn't get any calls...  @ Terry - The frog bite has been great the last couple of weeks!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
