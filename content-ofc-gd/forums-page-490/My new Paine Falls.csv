619034,BillM,2011-09-06 21:19:00,17367,Adam makes some great stuff!
619065,MJL,2011-09-06 23:16:00,2427,"Sweet reel  From the few Paine Falls reels I've been able to see on the local rivers, they feel solid and very well made. I think he made a small batch of black Apex knock-offs a couple years ago...I'd love to own one of those.LOL"
620905,newb09,2011-09-13 02:19:00,49,"Thanks everyone for the complement.  Like you said it is a such sweet piece of art thanks to Adam, I tried it (no fish yet) it works great, Very quick start up probably due to the fact that it is a 5"" diameter. The clicker is super strong so no more need to use any rubber bands. I m so excited to see it in action this fall.  I'll let you know then  "
