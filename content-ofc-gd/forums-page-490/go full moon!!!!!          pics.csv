620580,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 13:26:00,4661,well my dad and brother got out yesterday for some live bait musky... and they were on...  first drift they boated 2 musky... one was a pig... no tape but im thinking a solid 48+          then i got home from my trip to guelph around 4 pm and unpacked as quick as i could... called my brother... packed my boat and we were off for some evening eyes...  and what a night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  in 4-5 hours of fishing we boated 20 walleye from 2-9 pounds...  the highlight of the night were 2 beasts at 27 and 29 inches...  as well as an epic battle with what i THOUGHT was my soon to be pb walleye of my life... a damn sheephead over 10 pounds   this thing was peeling line like crazy.... oh well...      
620582,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 13:34:00,4661,hhhmmmmmm???        
620588,johnnyb,2011-09-12 13:53:00,3413,Gorgeous eyes there....and the muskies aren't too shabby either!  How do you guys fish live bait for them?
620591,GbayGiant,2011-09-12 14:04:00,1780,38 and 42  
620593,adolson,2011-09-12 14:11:00,783,"Wow! Nice fish, man!"
620595,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 14:13:00,4661, well the bigger one weighed 30 pounds.... so 48 is a good estimate for length.... if it was 42 itwould have been shaped like a carp...  but i wasnt there for the musky so i cant say for sure...
620596,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 14:15:00,4661,60lb nylon coated wire with a single 4/o-8/o octopus hook... slip sinker... 8-12 inch sucker hooked threw the nose...... basicaly a lindy rig for musky...
620599,Waterfowlr,2011-09-12 14:23:00,19,  Those are amazing Fish!  Way to be.  Thanks for the set up also...I use a similar method for early season pike...but never had any luck with Musky!
