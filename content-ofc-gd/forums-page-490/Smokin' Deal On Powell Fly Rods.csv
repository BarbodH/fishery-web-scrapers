It really is an amazing deal.  Couldn't resist so I bought 2 LOL!  Sierra is shipping the rods to the UPS store in Lewiston for me as well. I'll pick 'em up when I cross the border to fish.  You can get the additional discount by clicking here:  http://email.sierratradingpost.com/dm?id=FF74526B692ADB3BF255549843B57A7B   Anyhow, just thought I'd pass this along."

It's pretty painless setting up an account for dropoff at a mailbox depot at a neighboring US border city though.  Takes 2 mins to set up an account.  If you ever cross the border for any reason just stop in and pick up your packages."
