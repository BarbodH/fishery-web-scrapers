First question:  Ceramic guide inserts vs. Stainless steel guides   Is one better than the other? What is your preference and why?    And Next question   I've bought a few Shimano reels, and inside the box they have these little washer type things and the book in the box says they are to change the... motion? or something of the reel. What the heck are these?   I guess that's a few more than 2 questions. But just consider the other questions 'sub' questions.   Thanks guys."
