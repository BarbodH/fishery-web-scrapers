I've been out 5 of the last 7 days fishing Lake Winnipeg, chasing giant greenback walleye as they begin to stage prior to pushing upstream to spawn. This time of the year is a real workout on the auger and operator, ice is around 48"" thick and you really need to move to keep on top of schools of roaming fish.   If no fish show up on the screen in a spot in 10 mins, its time to move. 10 mins after the last fish was caught from an area, time to drill out in all directions to track the school...this could be one of those new diet fads, drill 75 holes a day in late season and results are guaranteed...actually this holds true in fishing as well.  Never let the fish go uncaught, for the lack for drilling one more hole.    Stay safe as the ice melts."

567865,alphaalpha,2011-03-31 16:30:00,475,"Looks like that hard work paid off, some beauty walleye right there!  Thanks for sharing."
567868,Nipfisher,2011-03-31 16:37:00,2449,Wow! How big was it?
567883,ehg,2011-03-31 17:16:00,2666,Those greenback walleyes are pretty darn big. They look like the small ones would be good eating.  Thanks for posting!

567929,Joey,2011-03-31 19:06:00,9122,"Wow, very clean looking eyes!  Very light in colour.  Great report.  Joey"
567934,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-31 19:16:00,0,seems you're having no troubles occupying yourself until we chase some steelies in april! what a tank!
567961,johnnyb,2011-03-31 20:10:00,3413,"Very nice stuff, Jay....looks like one of Sebile's spoons....meant to get me one of those this season...."
567966,Grimace,2011-03-31 20:28:00,2020,"Love those ""greenbacks"".  I would like to make the trip out there and hit up the big lake one day."
567989,WeedLine,2011-03-31 21:39:00,322,"Some BIG walleyes there. I never do well for walleye on high pressure, blue sky days. I guess you do though. Great report, pretty fish"
567990,Terry,2011-03-31 21:46:00,14456,note to self......make a winter trip to Lake Winnipeg........   oh  and nice fish
568186,troutologist,2011-04-01 14:32:00,951,"Thanks guys, the fishery is unreal. If you are willing to be mobile you can have some amazing days for numbers and size.  @ Weedline - the last few weeks definitely high skies were the best days. Morning bite was more pronounced but most if not all the big fish came from 1-3pm."
568236,Leecher,2011-04-01 16:48:00,7832,That second one sure is a hog Great job Jay
568277,trapshooter,2011-04-01 19:59:00,1234,"Good stuff Jay, too bad it closes March 31st... esp this year with the extended winter."
