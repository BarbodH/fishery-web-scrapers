568128,pikehunter,2011-04-01 11:31:00,1659,Bump it up!  If only I could do it I'd apply. Hope someone here knows somebody for the job. Looks like a good way to spend a spring and summer
568132,Handlebarz,2011-04-01 11:45:00,3790,I feel the same way about this Job I sure do kick my own   for not taking these opportunities when I was in Hi school. I did how ever have a great time every summer with so many memories I forget half of them.  If your a youngster take advantage of this you will love it and understand later in life why us older buggers tell you to get out there and do it.
568165,Muskieman,2011-04-01 13:30:00,2472,Obabika .....  one word    WOW
568166,johnnyb,2011-04-01 13:42:00,3413, X2   + Drrrrooooooolllll
568173,jimmer,2011-04-01 14:00:00,2730,If only I were younger. Like a previous post mentioned. How many of us kick ourselves for not doing this when we were younger. What an opportunity!
568181,Muskieman,2011-04-01 14:19:00,2472,"I did it for 6 years when I was younger.. From Schefferville P.Q... to Attawapiskat....Winisk...Revelstoke and the French River........  Awesome jobs if you can hack it. If I could do it all over again I would, in a heart beat."

568190,Pikeslayer,2011-04-01 14:37:00,1443,I think it would be a great match/opportunity for Pikeslayer Jr except for the fact that he returns to college in September .
568196,irishfield,2011-04-01 14:52:00,26272,I don't see anywhere where it says it is.. but is this for Obabika Lodge Randy??? Maybe I can help him find his back lake boats....
568199,johnnyb,2011-04-01 14:58:00,3413,I thought Obabika Lodge closed....or is that just the road going in?  I remember a pretty fun drive in my new-to-me Neon with 17ft of Grumman strapped to the roof     Man the rocks on that road were big!
568206,Muskieman,2011-04-01 15:23:00,2472,"  It's an educated guess ,it almost has to Obabika... Camp Manitou sold off their assets to L&G Landscaping and they sold off the camps to the public,  Blue Demon is a campground with a few housekeeping rentals..  Emerald Lake lodge is a housekeeping and trailer campground as well...Out of the four camps north of River Valley, the only ""real lodge"" on HWY 805 is Obabika."
568211,Muskieman,2011-04-01 15:29:00,2472, Closed at the gate .. there is no public access to Obabika.. the only 2 ways in are on private property (always was) Herberger used to let people cross his property and so did Goulard but not anymore... unless you have a plane  (Wayne) you're euchred  .. I have a friend that is a cabana girl there and gets paid a ridiculous amount and not to mention hefty tips...  Lakers are closed permanently Smallies are abundant and there are tons of trophy Pike .. man I would love to have again ..public access HWY 805 Group are lobbying to have a swath of land cleared for access... It's been in the works for about 15 years now... I'm not holding my breath.
568226,Joeytier,2011-04-01 16:17:00,3990,I would've been all over this had I not just landed a job in town.
568238,irishfield,2011-04-01 16:57:00,26272,I was told the new owner of Obabika lodge was only interested in running the lodge for now and wasn't doing any back lakes. Told this when I asked someone about Lodge boats I've found on back lakes and whether I could buy or use them. Told to just use them... he had no idea where they even were...
