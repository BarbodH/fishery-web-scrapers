568328,hammercarp,2011-04-01 22:57:00,964,The Great 2 Year Old Chili debate!
568396,Twocoda,2011-04-02 01:46:00,4130,ohhhh man....first 10 minutes invested in the propane tank debate and now two year old chili debate...beets the hell outta politics....  for some strange reason im glad there arent remote controls for computers...
568398,mercman,2011-04-02 01:49:00,7054,i wonder if chili can be kept cold enough in propane to be eaten 2 years later.
568406,irishfield,2011-04-02 02:08:00,26272,Considering Propane lives between -306 and -44F Paul... I'm sure it would do a great job!! The easiest way to lose your propane licence is to have TSSA catch you filling without gloves on !
568409,dhickey,2011-04-02 02:23:00,1038,hey..  where is fishnwire ?  ??????   chilly	oohhh bad bad bad    
568679,ehg,2011-04-03 14:01:00,2666,This is your best reply. I am a chef and nothing would be kept after 4-6 months in freezer even if vacuum packed. It will taste like crap unless you like the chemical flavour of freezer burn.

568683,mercman,2011-04-03 15:10:00,7054,Has anyone noticed that FishNWire is MIA I guess we know the answer to his question now
568754,Fishnwire,2011-04-03 20:51:00,983,"  I've been too busy to stop by...but I did eat the chili.  The texture was a little off, but it tasted fine and had no more a dramatic effect on my digestive system than freshly made chili does. It was actually pretty good...and although I love hotdogs...chilidogs are worth certain risks."
568757,Billy Bob,2011-04-03 21:01:00,5865, NICE.....I thought it would be OK to eat but might not be as good as when made......  When I was a younger we use to call them scum dogs or slime dogs when we went out to lunch on the RR.....I'm sure the 2 year old chili on top of your hot dog was fresher then the stuff the hot dog joints that was reheated for a week used on our scum dogs...
568758,BUSTER,2011-04-03 21:02:00,1336,
568759,Woodsman,2011-04-03 21:13:00,1286,Yeah if it didn't stick in your throat it sure wouldn't stick in you arse. Not saying it wouldn't make a quicker than expected exit from either the northern or southern route though!!!!
568776,mercman,2011-04-03 22:24:00,7054,  
568022,Fishnwire,2011-03-31 23:28:00,983,"I found a Tupperware container of chili I made and froze nearly two years ago.  I wonder if it's still good to eat.  It's not like I'll starve if I throw it away...It's just that I have some hot dogs I'm going to take to work for lunch and want to make them chili dogs.  I'm not going to make a fresh batch of chili just for the dogs, nor am I going to make an entire meal of the chili.  I defrosted it in the microwave and it looks/smells fine.  Still...it is two years old.  Hmmmmmmm..."
568024,cranks bait,2011-03-31 23:36:00,721,":whistling:Go for it.  It's frozen after all.  Now if it's full of frost it might not be as good, but the after effects might be better?"
568031,Rizzo,2011-03-31 23:54:00,4754,make sure your will is up to date...then go for it!
568032,bigbuck,2011-04-01 00:00:00,2449,It should be fine. Some frozen foods bought in stores are at least that old. As long as it wasn't thawed before enjoy!
568036,mercman,2011-04-01 00:10:00,7054,do it ..... do it........
568042,shane,2011-04-01 00:21:00,652,"When we still had our dog I would give stuff like that the 'lab' test. (She was a black lab). If she wouldn't eat it, I probably wouldn't.                  i"
568045,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-01 00:24:00,4399,Go for it
568060,tb4me,2011-04-01 01:10:00,3295,"  Awesome..That one is fine as a Photoless report..Kinda like ""here hold my beer and watch this"" Interesting"
568124,Jer,2011-04-01 11:04:00,1426,"  I've watched my dogs eat plenty of things I wouldn't...the latest was a dead mouse the cat left on the deck, should I have saved some for you?"
568130,fish_fishburn,2011-04-01 11:39:00,1311,"Heres what you do. Make some new chili for your chili dogs and take some extra buns, dogs and the old chili to work for the lads."
568136,fishindevil,2011-04-01 11:55:00,6254,"ah the great chili experiment   well if we dont hear from you in a day or so we know why!!!  lol  go for it,i have done that many times with different food and i aint dead yet...."
568143,Harrison,2011-04-01 12:34:00,2202," Whoa, I wouldn't be here if I used my lab as a guide!"
568161,Billy Bob,2011-04-01 13:19:00,5865,It will be safe to eat.....but it may not taste as good as it should...but then again it's chili so you probably wouldn't taste any difference.  Bob
568201,Cookslav,2011-04-01 15:08:00,1457,"Unless that Chilli is absolutely out of this world good.... I think the potential consequences out way the benefits by a long shot.  Its ""probobly"" ok if you cook the crap out of it...."
568204,Billy Bob,2011-04-01 15:20:00,5865," Yep, you can eat garbage if the internal temp reaches 165 degrees....sorry don't know what that would be in Canadian temps...."
568207,Headhunter,2011-04-01 15:23:00,5703,Skeeter.... calling Skeeter.... HH
568210,jedimaster,2011-04-01 15:27:00,3472,I had a beagle that would eat its own poop... It ate McNugget from Mcdonalds and barfed for hours.
568216,Billy Bob,2011-04-01 15:53:00,5865," I have a Skeeter on my Peter, ......oh well you all know the rest of the song...."
568275,Rattletrap2,2011-04-01 19:38:00,1652,"Do you eat from coffee trucks much? If so, your system will have built up immunities to anything that you could get from eating that 2 year old chili!!! After all, some of those sandwiches have been heating slowly for days, maybe even weeks!  Go for it!"
568284,BillM,2011-04-01 20:40:00,17367,"It's not like its uncooked chili, it's already been cooked!  Sans a little freezer burner (maybe) it will be fine."
568290,irishfield,2011-04-01 20:58:00,26272,"Cooked or uncooked.. it's been frozen the entire time (well I hope it has). No different than all the other items that get ""lost"" in a big chest freezer. I'd hate to know how old some of those items where that I ate out of my mothers 8' chest freezer, or for that matter what is in our own."
568291,mercman,2011-04-01 20:59:00,7054,THE OP hasnt been back. i wonder if he ate the chili Poor sucker.
568314,camillj,2011-04-01 22:31:00,1988,I just cooked up a huge batch of bacon that was more than 2 years past its best before date .. it was Sweeeeeeeet .... I have a friend who used to be in the international meat trade bus .... you'd be SHOCKED to know how old some of that stuff is before it hits your plate
568321,Whitespinnerbait,2011-04-01 22:46:00,2038,Get up from your Computer.....Find the Kitchen .....pick up Tupperware containing Chili.....throw in GARBAGE
568324,Rizzo,2011-04-01 22:49:00,4754, haha...I'd probably rather eat from your dog than a mcnugget too
