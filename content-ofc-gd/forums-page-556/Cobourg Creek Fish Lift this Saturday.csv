567449,chessy,2011-03-30 02:09:00,610,Thanks Ron hope to see you there
567474,young_one,2011-03-30 04:18:00,620,"Great event! Participated last year, unfortunately can't go this year due to work. My steelhead season felt better after the fish lift. Help some fish to spawn and collect fish karama!"
567623,FlyGuy5,2011-03-30 21:46:00,101,I'll be there Ron can't wait! 
567629,tb4me,2011-03-30 22:18:00,3295,"fish lift, eh? How does it work? Can you actually net them and move them upstream? This I would like to see...."
567632,Handlebarz,2011-03-30 22:24:00,3790,Always look forward to this post then the ones to follow. I hope for great weather for you guys so that you can make the Odyssey Next weekend.
567653,Michael_Brown,2011-03-30 23:20:00,411,I'm in as always. This is something I look forward to each spring.  
567776,Ron,2011-03-31 11:08:00,1683,"  If you look at the few pictures posted, you will see a dam in the background. The fish are pushed up into the pool below the dam and a net is set across the creek. People then go in with nets and attempt to catch them. Once caught, they are brought over to the OMNR staff and placed in holding pens where the Biologists ID the sex, a quick measure, check for lamprey marks, stocked, etc...  Once they are ID'd, they are then set into a large basket, 3 at the most at a time and then lifted with ropes and pulleys attached to an ATV to lift them up to the top of the dam. They are released above the dam to hopefully find the spawning grounds before they are harvested.  This is all manual ""hands on"" work and by the end of the lift, you get all warm and fuzzy inside knowing you have helped improve the chances for a continuing population of Rainbow Trout for future generations to enjoy. There are many people who come out to participate, most of them don't even fish for trout, yet there are so many that fish for these and make a living from it and you don't even see them come out to cheer us on, rather ironic I think.  Cheers, Ron..."
567852,Victor,2011-03-31 15:34:00,1609,"I may come help out on Saturday.  Ron, is there anything that we need to bring other than Waders?"
567879,Bly,2011-03-31 17:01:00,1556,Thanks for the info Ron
567891,frozen-fire,2011-03-31 17:42:00,542,Do we need to bring nets?  I don't think I have any as large as the ones in the pics.
567917,newboykool,2011-03-31 18:39:00,81,do we need to sign up for it? me and a friend could use some volunteer hours =] and of course..some quality time with those trouts =D
568030,Ron,2011-03-31 23:51:00,1683,"    Yes, if you have nets, please bring em along.  You do not need to preregister, there is a simple sign in for where you print your name and then signature.  If you are looking for the volunteer hours, be sure to bring your sheet along with you and have one of teh MNR staff sign it.  Cheers, Ron..."

568420,Michael_Brown,2011-04-02 02:47:00,411,"  The water is about 40 degrees. This should read. ""Coffee, Coffee and more coffee"""

568566,Michael_Brown,2011-04-02 23:56:00,411,"Well it was a fantastic day, for weather, friends and fish.  Thank you to everyone who help out with the successful lifting of 200 rainbows over the dam in Cobourg Creek.    We saw some gorgeous  fish.    This will take a couple of posts to show photos of the great fun had by all involved."
568567,spinnerbaitking,2011-04-03 00:05:00,1622,"Saw it on the News tonight great to see the weather cooperated for them, easier to dress for weather like this, :thumbsup_anim::clapping::worthy: SBK"
568569,Michael_Brown,2011-04-03 00:06:00,411,"The famous Ron was hard at it all day but he seemed confused as he went back and forth 40 feet in the same spot all morning, on the ATV.   Most importantly a lot of families and their kids stopped by and learned about Rainbow trout and their spring spawning run. "
568573,Michael_Brown,2011-04-03 00:12:00,411,"So if you want to help out next year, prepare to get wet but have a lot of fun.    Also plan on seeing some big gorgeous rainbows on their way upstream to provide us fun for years to come.  "
568575,Michael_Brown,2011-04-03 00:18:00,411,"Oh, did I mention the family fun. The lovely bride and little man stopped in to help us this year.   "
