Lost a ~15"" brown on the river bank while waiting for a camera man but the last steelie made up for it.  All fish were caught on brown roe and swam away to be caught again.           Check out the nice colourations on this hen    Grabbed a new Sage VT2 9'5 8 wt for a great deal and 3880 reel, next report will be on the fly!  Cheers"
