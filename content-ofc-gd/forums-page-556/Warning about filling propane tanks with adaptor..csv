568385,danc,2011-04-02 01:23:00,4677,This ones gone on long enough.
568077,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-01 02:56:00,0, LOL Terry ...I don't have to watch Myth busters to know that propane tanks do not blow up. Even with the help of a fire around it they only make a small fire ball. Shooting them does nothing at all. Even the 20 lbders do nothing when shot. You have to have a fire around them to make anything happen and even then its a fireball not an explosion.. You're more likely to burn yourself lighting the BBQ.  Propane has a scent to it for a reason and is your first clue to not light anything when you smell a leak. Winternet is still on so it seems.
568087,ld17,2011-04-01 03:30:00,319,stop with all the scare hype on filling the 1lb bottles.  Tell me what's the difference when I go to crappy tire with my 20lb tank and the kid fills it up from the huge tank that we are both standing beside.  I should be more worried about that huge tank exploding than filling a 1lb bottle.  No one is forcing anyone to fill 1lb bottles.  You don't want to do it don't buy them.  If you do you can save some money.  Done

""is it wise"", that would be a decision each person would have to make on their own ...was that my argument?...not even once did I say that...safe...yeah I said that and stand by it your argument seems to be ""I know you are but what am I"""

This is similar to many other things that are 'illegal' or that you need a license for...(boat operator card    comes to mind)"

This is however is what we deal with on OFC, remember people you are dealing with this mine set, no freaking respect untill someone gets hurt or death.The government puts in alot of precautions to help us deal with idiots who have no respect for death or hurt to inocent others.Can anyone imagine getting into accident and finding out you lost your love ones because some idiot filled his tire with propane instead of air.The same thing goes with filling your 1lb cylinders at home the government does not want to deal with the fire ball or explosion that may happen, if a regulated technician is at fault so be it.The fact is the government knows how dangerous propane can be, so regulations are put in place, but we still have idiots filling there spare tires with it, I have a propane filling Licsence, have had one for 15yrs, my advice is respect the propane, learn alittle about the gas and then make you decsion"
568343,Terry,2011-04-01 23:20:00,14456,"see this is the problem..people write with no knowledge or experience in what they are talking about  a tire filled with propane is not a fire hazard, I know you want it to be and I am sure you are one of the people who ran around saying the world would end when they heard people would try to use microwave ovens in their homes..  but the fact is a tire filled with propane has less chance of exploding then the cars gas tank or the propane tanks being carried in the truck....you can cry the sky is falling the sky is falling but if you had looked at the links I posted you would see they could get a tank to blowup shooting it,,the used tracer bullets to try to ignite it ...no luck.......  I take it you don't smoke..cause about 2000 times more dangerous then propane...but run forest run...you will get there  is that a piece of the sky on the ground over there......"

568361,Terry,2011-04-02 00:01:00,14456, see you don't have any idea what you are talking about...you are making up a problem that just isn't there  it is less dangerous then the gas in your gas tank...and if it did burn it would burn for about 2.5 seconds and would do very little if any damage there would not be enough force from the ignition of the propane to cause more damage to things around the crash site.....you are not talking about a bomb..  if a tire some how went off it might singe your hair but not much more and if the tire blew it would likely not catch fire and would do no more the a tire filled equally with air....... you are inventing a problem that just isn't there  and you have killed far more people with second hand smoke then everyone in canada with refilled propane has   killed...  oh and people are not driving around with propane tires......one time in the middle of no where I got a flat and I filled it to get to a garage to get the tire repaired.........you are trying hard to make a big deal out of something you know nothing about ...the way you are talking about nothing about it at all  you are making things up that just are not true

If you don't beleive me, take a propane refilling course,these people are great to work with and they will open your eyes about propane,trust me I learned alot about this volatile gas. I agree it's not dangerous if you and everyone treats it properyly,it becomes dangerous when idiots misuse it to fill tires and such"
568379,Terry,2011-04-02 00:57:00,14456, sorry but you are full of crap you have no idea what you are talking about.....I have taken the course..years ago...I have played with and test propane in many ways and I am telling you it is a lot harder to ignite then people think...and everything in the world is/can be dangerous. all you can do is weigh it against other things in your life...... and if you do the math you personally will kill 100 people with second hand smoke for every 1 person that I kill with propane in a tire..that's it you do the math..play the odds.. so who is the moron......  you can't smoke ...then get all high and mighty about less dangerous things..it makes you a moron
567841,Nipfisher,2011-03-31 15:04:00,2449,"Propane   Technical Standards and Safety Authority News Release  ********************  Toronto - The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) have issued an alert regarding propane cylinder adaptors, designed to transfer propane from a BBQ-type cylinder to a smaller, non-refillable cylinder (typically 1-pound camp-stove bottles), that are being offered to the public via online retailers. These adaptors are illegal in the province of Ontario – as refilling non-refillable cylinders is prohibited by the Propane Storage and Handling Code – and pose safety risks to the public such as serious fires, explosions and burn hazards.  Propane cylinders must be filled by weight or volume as specified by the maximum value that is safely permitted by law. Cylinders must also be filled by a TSSA-licensed facility. Transferring propane from a BBQ-type cylinder to a smaller, non-refillable cylinder cannot be safely performed and the practice is illegal in the province of Ontario. The public is warned of this propane cylinder adaptor and the potential safety risks to the user."
567851,Terry,2011-03-31 15:30:00,14456,30+ years of doing it  and now they say it's bad    and I think they are wrong about it being illegal ..............maybe for a commercial use but not for private uses

567855,Fisherman,2011-03-31 16:00:00,7201,"Well then the TSSA should send out a flash to retailers and have them pulled from the market.  I've never been one to refill the small tanks, in the long run a 5 lber does the job just as well."
567873,perchslayer666,2011-03-31 16:50:00,280,"Well this isn't news to me, they should pull these products off the market immediately to prevent and accidents from happening... If you need to use a 1lb tank or something of similar size, buy a 5 lb refillable tank - way cheaper to fill, and meant to be re-used many times."

567905,Terry,2011-03-31 18:10:00,14456," there is no more risk then hooking up any propane tank to a heater/BBQ.....it's all hype....  there isn't enough pressure to cause any type of problem  and propane is a fairly stable gas..just like natural gas..do you think you could run it into all those home if it wasn't  there would be a gas explosion every day if it wasn't  hell I got a flat tire once, dragged out the spare only to find it flat  I had a couple of tanks of propane and a valve adapter so I filled the tire up with propane...worked great......  oh and I save close to 100 bucks a year on those little suckers"

567953,Terry,2011-03-31 19:46:00,14456," but that happens to as many store bought ones as refilled ones  that goes for any stored in a house but that makes them no more unsafe then any other propane tan, which was my point in that............."

567968,Terry,2011-03-31 20:34:00,14456,"  and of course it was not caused by refilling 1 lb tanks.. but lets see how many cars explode from gasoline compared to how many houses explode due to natural gas ....still one of the safest ways to heat a house..  and filling tires work and will not explode..I know lots of people who carried propane tanks for just that purpose, year ago.. ..now if you showed me a case where a propane tire exploded or for that matter even one link to a news story that claims a (refilled)1 lb tank exploded then you have an argument.....so far lots of talk no facts"

568055,mercman,2011-04-01 01:03:00,7054,"like some one else said.WHY would someone want to risk their lives on serious injury refillling these things CT has them 3 for 8 bucks at least twice a year As Papa said, the tanks wont explode, but since the gas is heavier than air, a leaky tank is the danger.The gaz could accumulate and a spark is all thats needed for it to burst into flame.Try leavin the valves on your BBQ open for 10 seconds before igniting.say good bye to facial and arm hair."
568062,Bernie,2011-04-01 01:17:00,3190,You fellows that are saying it isn't dangerous haven't seen the results from propane explosions. Don't treat it as if it wasn't! Filling a container more than 80% full doesn't leave enough room for expansion. I have done courses on propane conversions in vehicles in the past and presently have a filling licence. Also as a retired volunteer firefighter we also had extensive training on propane fires. Proper handling is needed.
568064,Terry,2011-04-01 01:33:00,14456,"and how many tank explosions have you seen where the tank wasn't already in an intense fire/heat....   and I say again, a refilled tanks is no more dangerous then store bought tanks...... and without heat to expand it..a 1lb tank will not explode form being filled more then 80%  it just means there is no room for the liquid to turn to gas before it gets to the appliance..  in the greater scheme of things they are pretty safe  but again I say..and my point was a refilled 1lb tank isn't more dangerous then a store bought tank..each person can decide for themselves how dangerous a store bought tank or any propane tank is.............. everyone should have a healthy respect for propane check out myth buster shooting tanks myth busters"
