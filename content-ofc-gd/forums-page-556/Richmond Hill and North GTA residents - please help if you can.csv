I recently learned that there is something super simple that I (we all) can do to help out.  A simple mouth swab to get in to the bone marrow registry and maybe save a person's life.  http://cbaf.ca/pdfs/cure-for-cathy.pdf  This loving wife and mother of 3 needs help.  Maybe it could even be one of us that saves her life.  There is a bone marrow registry clinic at Hillcrest Mall today and this weekend in Richmond Hill.  If you are outside of the area - it is simple to request a kit and mail it back it.  Thanks for your attention, Charles"
