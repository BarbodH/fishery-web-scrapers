567540,limeyangler,2011-03-30 15:47:00,5204,"Hi All,  I think my last 'proper' fishing outing and report was close to three weeks ago. Since then Family, conflicting work schedules and weather (not necessarily in that order) have kept me off the ice more than i would have liked. I was really looking forward to getting out there with our little boy lots this past three weeks, but alas did not pan out that way. He has been aching to get out with dad....he even found his own indoor ice auger to practice in the meantime!   VERY IMAGINATIVE BOY....HE CAME UP WITH THIS GAME BY HIMSELF!  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ks-7pn3QcMA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   In between night shifts etc... we got out a couple of times for some practice runs on the snowmachine, trying to get him used to going longer distances without falling asleep....lol...the combination of snug warm snowsuit, cuddling up close to dad, the hum of the engine and rocking motion usually have him in the Land of Nod, steaming up his visor whilst sawing logs within 15 minutes.  A FEW PRACTICE RUNS ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO.  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/lMVz1xgh2vk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   Weather just hasn't been kind or conducive to getting out much, throw in work schedules etc....very patchy few weeks fishing. Basically 2 and a half weeks ago we hit a big thaw...fine...actually very little slush on the lakes after a couple days + temps and sun, but work kept me home. Then the weather got REAL cold again and froze the surface snow rock solid....I NEED A QUAD! We did manage to get out in front of the house one evening before the big thaw came, had lots of fun, but unfortunately my boy has yet to see dad pull a fish through the ice...!!!!????    GREAT FUN IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE!                                                    I did manage to get out around 15th March to take a friend of ours' young boy out....was not a hugely successful outing fish wise...but the boy had fun and got his first ever whitefish...he was well pleased with that......and his dad is in trouble as he now wants a fishfinder for icefishing!   IAN'S 1ST WHITEFISH!  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VojFgXtZUkU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>       I MANAGED A COUPLE SMALL WALLEYE AND A WHITEFISH TOO           The next week was all work and 'ships passing in the night' type work schedules...and even when I had the time, the conditions were way to cold to take Jack out....wind-chill being the main factor.....but all through that week jack would constantly remind me through the medium of play that he had a desire to hit the ice........   GET THE HINT ALREADY DAD!!!!        The weekend before last we went out to take down my buddy's shack, Im glad he took his snowmachine cuz I would not want to melt my sliders out there, and being liquid cooled...not much if anything to keep the heat exchangers happy either. Lew's buddy brought his quad too and that helped....DID I MENTION I WANT A QUAD?! I had to be back for five o'clock, and not much fishing was done up till then anyway, I got a small, well fed Jackfish, and Lew got a walleye just as I had to head out.   GOODBYE SHACK TILL NEXT YEAR  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/U4fUFGXo8wo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>            The whole of last week was work again, and despite being off at 6 pm which now means being able to get a few hours in front of the house things just did not work out that way. However, this Monday just gone we finally made it out, weather was perfect...a nice +2. We had to walk in about 1 click, but Jack was perfectly happy lying down in the sleigh there and back.  It was awesome fun, Jack had the time of his life, but as the sun started to set the temps dropped really quickly. We were not catching fish either and he was getting cold and bored....so I quickly carted him back on the sleigh and mum drove him home, he fell asleep in the car on the 10 minute drive back...lol...exhausted!   PERFECT FEW HOURS WITH FAMILY   <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nwuQJ5UW3Yk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                                              I scurried back out and we stayed till dark, I forgot that Erika (my wife) had the camera so only managed a picture of the fish when I got home. I got a nice 21"" walleye and a 16"" and 3 small whitefish, my buddy Al got to whitefish. I cant believe that my boy has yet to see a fish come through the ice...he would be SOOOOOOOO excited...oh well, we have another 2 weeks before walleye close, and enough ice out the front of the house to last to the end....weather is gonna be all + during the day for the next 2 weeks too...hopefully the fish move through our bay this year."

567560,Blue Lk,2011-03-30 17:57:00,337,"I agree with you about the weather this past 2 wks,now everything is crusted over so hard there is no lube for sliders on the sleds,you need a quad for sure,OR you could get 1 of these to pull your little guy & your stuff.  http://i631.photobucket.com/albums/uu35/BlLake "
567561,beginner,2011-03-30 18:07:00,542,"OMG ur boy is natural in fishing, when I saw his pic he makes me smile... I wish I had a son, someday I will feel the way you are feelin limeyangler...  I enjoy every bit of it...  like the sunglasses too, so cool... good job man   bfisher"

567950,manitoubass2,2011-03-31 19:32:00,11391,"Awesome pics and report, and usual Limey! Always glad to see the kids getting out and having fun!  So, when are you gonna head down to Emo??? We have to get out man, walleye run has begun, it's all soft water on Rainy River, and the mommas should be here in a week or so. Right now it's all 17-22"" eyes, but those 30"" mommas are comin' very soon!"
568053,limeyangler,2011-04-01 00:59:00,5204," Thanks Dan    Hope to get out a bit more...this saturday looks good for me...just hoping the rain forcast does not kill off the snow in the bush too much...should be good though...lots of snow on the ground still.   He calls them....""dood glasses""    Some of the best people i know are 'rednecks'  LOL...now there is something i never thought i'd say in my whole life 5 years ago...lol    He was laughing his head off there wayne...he was gradually sliding down the hill.    LOL...thanks Corvy...will pass on the message.    Awww shucks:blush: ...thanks Joey    You da man JB...nice to know you got my back. What you been upto...you have been 'relatively' quiet too.    My pleasure hammer"
568056,limeyangler,2011-04-01 01:03:00,5204, Boy...you must think i'm the most ungrateful dude ever...so many invites and still yet to fish with ya. I really appreciate the offers and would almost saw off my...well...leg....to come down. How many hours drive from Dryden are you again...i kinda feel if its gonna happen its gonna be a one day trip..lets just do it!  Another member Rickster is from Emo...do you know him?
568059,Bernie,2011-04-01 01:08:00,3190,That was a very good post Limey. Thanks for sharing. It reminds me of fishing with my son at that age.
568183,manitoubass2,2011-04-01 14:22:00,11391," No, not ungrateful at all, lol, I'm just giving you a friendly reminder of an invite! haha  If you can make it, great, if not, no big deal. It's not like Dryden isn't near some amazing fishing (Lac Seul)  I think it's about 1.5 hours if I remember correctly. Head down highway 11 until the turn off to Souix Narrows/ Nestor Falls, and we are right at the end of that highway."
568219,Leecher,2011-04-01 16:07:00,7832,"You been slacking or something    Joke / Joke Great report, pics and videos as usual Simon Little Jack is certainly growing fast Thanks for taking the time to compile this report and share with us!!! Jacques"
