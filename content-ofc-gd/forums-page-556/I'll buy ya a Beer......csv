568356,aplumma,2011-04-01 23:47:00,6896, See he is only offering 1 metric beer and that is like 1/2 of an American beer. However it does balance out in the end since the American beer is only 1/2 the alcohol. With this logic it proves your Box of 12 beer is only equal to 12 of our beers.    Art
568448,Billy Bob,2011-04-02 11:43:00,5865,"Not to mention Art, that NO ONE can afford purchasing more than 12 Canadian beers at one time unless they robbed a liquor store first..."
568501,Rattletrap2,2011-04-02 19:00:00,1652,"Guys, No self respecting Canadian buys his beer in 12 packs! Go big, or go home! LOL  Course, you are correct, you might have to extend your line of credit to accomplish this feat, but 24 is the norm. 28 in some cases."
