Humminbird® Fishfinder 768 Sonar External GPS Combo - 299 2. Lowrance® Mark-5x DSI Gray Scale Fishfinder - 299  knowing its an american based site, most than likely our store wont have it, or will for a different price. can some one recoment what models are good... would like to have mapping and gps included. and something thats somewhat reliable. i do not care about colour screens, high resolution.  and enother question.... can i have 2 fishfinders installed to feed from same battery as the motor? i do have additional 2 batteries that attached to trolling motor, maybe its beter to attach on them???"
