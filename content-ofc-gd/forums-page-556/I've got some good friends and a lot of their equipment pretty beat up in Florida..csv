568073,irishfield,2011-04-01 02:41:00,26272,You can google it...Sun n Fun Tornado... but the video I've linked here starts on my Buddy Clair's CLAMAR float booth.. or what's left of it. Still trying to contact him to see if he and his 68 year old wife are okay. The booth across from him is Air Cam with all their equipment destroyed and his floats high in the air under one of them . Zenair (from Midland Ontario) lost their entire display and all their airplanes as did a few of my Supercub buddies. both display booths and private aircraft. They saved a few aircraft with numerous people holding down a single airplane.    Makes me ill just looking at it all...    
568074,Nipfisher,2011-04-01 02:50:00,2449,That sucks.
568075,irishfield,2011-04-01 02:51:00,26272,It really does and I'm handcuffed sitting here unable to leave with my recovery trailer to help them.
568076,bpsbassman,2011-04-01 02:55:00,941,That's terrible Wayne.
568081,Rattletrap2,2011-04-01 03:11:00,1652,"Really very sad Wayne. I would imagine that a lot of those planes are ""priceless"" when it comes to replacement?"
568082,irishfield,2011-04-01 03:19:00,26272,"Many probably have some insurance on them.. but that doesn't replace them or the personal attachment most of these have, since they were generally built by a guy in his garage/basement/living room.  The vendor area was hit the hardest and most of them can't afford a loss like this. It's also a very regular occurance that the aircraft in the ""booths"" don't belong to the kit manufacturer, but are private individuals ""art"" that they are willing to put in the kit manufactures booth to help them sell their goods.  I've at least hooked up one of my friends with a ride home from Florida, to save him a few dollars that will hopefully help cover boxing and shipping his mess, as my f-in-law is leaving his Coral Cove residence for Ontario this weekend and is making room for him in the truck."
568084,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-01 03:25:00,10439,Yeah Wayne it was a nasty storm. I had freinds who live in Tampa tell of hiding in a bank while the tornado went through their area today. Scary stuff!!

568115,Handlebarz,2011-04-01 09:38:00,3790,Dang Wayne thats crazy. I hope everyone was safe
568117,SlowPoke,2011-04-01 10:47:00,2984,Wow... not much more you can say to describe that. Something tells me you might be late going north again this year.
568119,mercman,2011-04-01 10:54:00,7054,Man !!!That sucks big time Wayne.Tornados are rare occurances in Florida aren't they I pray all your friends are safe at least.
568179,irishfield,2011-04-01 14:12:00,26272,Most likely won't get North much anyhow Brian with what's going on here. Not sure I have time for any of that mess either...  Talked to my buddy Clair at least at 2am.. he and his wife are fine. They're going back this morning to try and find some of their stuff. Their motorhome and trailer are still driveable.
568225,Leecher,2011-04-01 16:14:00,7832,That's insane Wayne Glad to hear that your buddy and wife are ok
