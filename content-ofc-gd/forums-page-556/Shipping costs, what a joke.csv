567984,Cudz,2011-03-31 21:27:00,2652,I bought 2 lures Northern Bass in the states and had them shipped here.  I asked for the cheapest postal rate.  When I checked out the total for my purchases was $25.99.   They sent a confirmation email with the total befor shipping. When I received the package I had been charged $18.95 for shipping!!!!!  That was the first time I had been informed of the shipping cost. My 2 lures cost over $44.00.  I am used to ordering lures from another guy in the states and his charges are always $3.99 (they used to be $3.50) and they arrive just a s fast.  Anyway I talked to the owner and informed him that I was not happy with the shipping costs.  He did offer to refund me $7 but I have just decided to take my business elsewhere.  Live and learn.  I am done venting
567986,d_paluch,2011-03-31 21:31:00,343,"Wow!  That seems almost as outrageous as 99.9% of the sellers on ebay's shipping charges. You should have taken the $7 and take your business elsewhere. That is completely unacceptable, especially from a retailer such as Northern Bass. My question is, were there duty charges involved?"
567992,bassjnkie,2011-03-31 22:02:00,1101,I think you were charged: Taxes and Brokerage fees. Also happened to me.
567993,Cudz,2011-03-31 22:03:00,2652,No Duty. I have never been charged duty on lures under $40
567996,Terry,2011-03-31 22:17:00,14456,was it strait shipping fees or was there broker fees like UPS sucks out of us each time they are the courier from the USA
568000,John,2011-03-31 22:24:00,2956," Was is USPS or UPS? Never ship anything UPS, they handle their own clearance and seem to charge whatever they want. Sounds like a lot for USPS, maybe the seller marked up the actual shipping cost and called it ""handling""."
568001,Cudz,2011-03-31 22:25:00,2652,Straight shipping fee.  No broker fees it was USPS regular postal service. From Northern Bass shipping rates to Canada $0.01 - $25.00   =   $16.95 $25.00 - $49.99  =  $18.95  Too bad my 2 lures cost $25.98
568002,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-31 22:31:00,10439, They are most likely using USPS flat rate shipping. USPS has 4 differnt sized flat rate boxes that businesses can use and ship up to 70# for a flat rate. That same package you recieved could theoretically have been filled with 70# of leadhead jigs and shipped for the same price.  There are lots of other stores that charge the same way (x dollars in goods = so much shipping) including Bass Pro and Cabelas.  Your real complaint is they didn't tell you before they shipped it so you could have cancelled the transaction if you had wanted to.
568019,Guest LivingLegend,2011-03-31 23:15:00,0,Well if you lose them lures you better dive in after them. It just make ya wanna not shop in the US when Bull like that happens. I have had a couple situations like that. Pretty much a hit or miss deal.......
568102,bassmaster4,2011-04-01 05:38:00,801,same happened here i ordered four of the triggerfish and shipping was like 21 bucks freaking rediculous my total was over 70 dollars for 4 lures
568106,jiaodong1983,2011-04-01 07:23:00,14,nice
568113,Handlebarz,2011-04-01 09:28:00,3790,That is one of the biggest scams out there Shipping/Handling this way they can say its the Handling part.  I don't know why some of our NON Friends from the south want to over charge us up here? Is it to make the extra cash for them selves or is it to save them the hassle of shipping to Canada?  I know I always try and remember to ask and get the shipping before I give my credit card as I to fell into one of them traps years ago.  shipping rates are so much cheaper from the USA to Canada I don't understand why some charge that much extra.  I hope them lures work great for ya.
568138,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-01 12:00:00,4399,"I would never give out my CC number without knowing what the TOTAL charges are,I am funny that way! I have been to the end of online transaction and have cancelled because of shipping charges."
568155,walleyejack,2011-04-01 13:02:00,358,"Thats just insane,I purchased rod holders which came in a box twice the size of a shoe box and was $12.00 from Pa.no tax,no duty.One has to watch where they shop and get all the details. just my tcw"

568198,johnnyb,2011-04-01 14:56:00,3413,"I ordered 4 lures from them Cudz....my shipping was $19.95.  I'm splitting the purchase with someone else...so that helps....but the total price for 4 lures was $71.  So we are at $17/lure, to your $22.  Still hurts....but I definitely have an itchy trigger finger now"
