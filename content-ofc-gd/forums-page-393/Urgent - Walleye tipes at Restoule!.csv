I have been at this park before and the bass fishing was pretty good, but I didn't get any walleye (didn't specifically target them). I have never caught a walleye and would like some general tips. We're bulking up on leeches. I've heard of these fish being active at night, is this right after sunset or later in the night?"

I would try using worm harnesses (go-getters).  I usually troll them on the French and nearby on the Pickeral - I would think that they would work on Restoule as well.  I find weedbeds and troll the outside of them in 14ft of water.  I let out plenty of line with 2 no.4 split shots and a fluor. orange go-getter with a worm.  Line test is 6lb."
