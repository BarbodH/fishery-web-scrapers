Decided to try and give muskie a go on the sunday of opening weekend. My cousin and I got up at 5: 30. Only lure I had was a large black and orange spinner bait. Worked the edges of the floating bogs. Picked up a few oos bass. Drifted over a small pencil reed island and upon exiting the other end I let my lure stop and fall beside the boat to light a smoke and bang fish on.   Little guy 28"". First ever muskie. Yeah baby. Rubber net, quick pic, measurement and release. No harm and still lots of spunk.  7: 00 am. Drifted over to a floating bog island. First cast into the channel and it exploded on impact. Little bigger, 32"", but way stronger. Great fight. Same catch and release as earlier. 8: 0am.  Back to the trailer for breakfast at 9: 00 am. Great morning all around."

708800,kickingfrog,2012-06-24 22:36:00,8333,"Nice, but don't expect to double up on pbs in 2hours of fishing too often."
708805,Rich Clemens,2012-06-24 22:46:00,3131,Congrats.   2 PB an hour apart don't happen too often.   Lots of room left to keep raising the  bar.
708821,Handlebarz,2012-06-24 23:34:00,3790,Great going sounds like we have another convert your fishing life has just changed. For the better lol.
708824,bigbuck,2012-06-24 23:37:00,2449,I see your future clearly now.... You will be spending a lot of time and money on musky fishing. LOL
708826,Christopheraaron,2012-06-24 23:39:00,3525,Nice! To be able to catch 2 decent musky in 2 hours is a very special event.
708851,Broker,2012-06-25 00:46:00,482,Congrats on the pb!
708853,Broker,2012-06-25 00:47:00,482,Congrats on the pb!
708896,nancur373,2012-06-25 03:05:00,1211,Thanks guys. Took my 5 year old soon out for a couple hours today for bass. Found myself throwing that same lure again. Couple descent  LMB and one muskie follow. Couldn't get her to commit.
708898,nancur373,2012-06-25 03:07:00,1211,"Oh and just got a few lures from my my neighbor. Top water raider(I think that's what it's called, and a jerk bait. Will try them next weekend."
708900,nancur373,2012-06-25 03:09:00,1211,shhhhh. Don't tell my wife.
708901,Fisherpete,2012-06-25 03:09:00,1814,"Congrats on the skis! Let the addiction begin. I still remember how pumped I was getting my first one back in 2003 (35"").  Pete"
708904,nancur373,2012-06-25 03:11:00,1211,Man all the talk I hear about muskie fishing is hard and many days of no fish and the fish of a thousand casts. Thins stuff is a walk in the park dude.   Think I'll chalk it up to beginners luck. Lol
708939,cowanjo,2012-06-25 11:35:00,249,"Only lure I had was a large black and orange spinner bait  Thats awesome - congrats - I think Mike P chipped in above he will become your new best friend. It has been great to see just the numbers of smaller muskie around this year, must have been a great year class a couple of years ago, we also have been catching many in the 32-34 size."
708940,Joeytier,2012-06-25 11:38:00,3990,"I caught a 50"" ski on my first ever official musky trip.  I think I should stop before things get out of hand.  Nice fish"
708943,Gregoire,2012-06-25 11:57:00,1397,"Nice Job. I would advise you to only pic up a few lures that are proven producer. If you buy a new lure, make sure you know it will catch fish in the body of water you are fishing. Do not walk in to a tackle store and buy a lure because it looks good. Having said that my advice is useless, as when you truly gt hooked your spend your season fishing, and your off season collecting lures."
709046,nancur373,2012-06-25 16:14:00,1211, My neighbors fishing has slowed down a lot the last few years. I think these pics got the bug back in him. Maybe I'll go out with him and use his lures. lol
709081,Jacob,2012-06-25 17:31:00,186,Great fish.
