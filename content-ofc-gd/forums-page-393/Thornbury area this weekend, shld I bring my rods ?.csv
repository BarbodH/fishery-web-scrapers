709023,woodenboater,2012-06-25 15:33:00,2277,"Hey all,  Might be in the Thornbury area this long weekend and will be without boat unfortunately. I'm not sure what bass/pike fishing opportunities there are up there so I'm wondering if it's worth bringing my rods. Was thinking perhaps some of the conservation areas might be worth hitting up for a couple of hours. Or should I just hit the Dam Pub instead  Don't mind driving a little bit but, maybe half to an hour tops.  PM if you want to keep things under the radar.   tia  WB"

709028,woodenboater,2012-06-25 15:39:00,2277,"ah, you been digging through old threads eh"
709029,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 15:39:00,2710,Both rivers that are in that area that start with the letter B have bass in the lower end. Its just not hot and heavy.
709032,woodenboater,2012-06-25 15:44:00,2277," Thanks M&S,  Can't be any worse than Mountsberg lol. Are they access friendly or would you try the conservation areas ?  WB"
709033,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 15:52:00,2710,Access is no problem for most of them. And with no steelhead around you'll have the place to yourself
709064,Christopheraaron,2012-06-25 16:47:00,3525," And the web, hope to try it soon."
709104,fishinmortician,2012-06-25 18:35:00,100,You can follow the beaver for miles. There are many good holes with a chance for resident rainbow and brown trout. If you can find a good map you can find all your access points all the way from Georgian bay to Heathcote to Kimberly. Bass have slowed as water levels have dropped. Good luck
709132,misfish,2012-06-25 19:41:00,29133," Good call.  Not sure if they will allow you to chuck any baits in the marina,but worth a try."
