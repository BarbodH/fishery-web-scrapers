To surprise me, this time we caught most bass around there. Caught alot of perch, plus some nice bass (released). After 2 pm, bass suddently stop biting. Guess we relased too much, lol. Called a day.  Landed about 20 smallies/2 anglers. The biggest one is probably over 5 pd, a few 3~4 pounders, and the rest are 2~2.5 pd.  Keep some good size perch (11~13 inches) for dinner. Great opener.                    "
709264,Gregoire,2012-06-26 01:53:00,1397,those perch look almost as big as the bass. Well done.
709268,ccmtcanada,2012-06-26 02:05:00,7971,Great opener!  I still haven't found the 5+ pound bass yet...hoping to change that this weekend!
