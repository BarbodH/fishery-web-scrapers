708910,funfishing,2012-06-25 03:25:00,147,"Nice bass, congrats on a PB"
708914,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 03:30:00,2710,Yes never give a weight just measurements in inches if you give a weight people are going to dump all over you. That being said nice fish.
708918,mercman,2012-06-25 03:41:00,7054,"  What if the OP is 6'6""?..........That would make it at least 5lbs i would guess.  Nice lookin smallie bud !!!!"

708929,Roy,2012-06-25 09:53:00,13728,Congrats on a very nice fish. That was a good evening of fishing for sure. Thanks for sharing.
708935,mike rousseau,2012-06-25 11:22:00,4661,Nice catch...  I'm a big guy and my fish never look their real size... I have a pic with a 7.5lb smallie but it looks like a 4-5 pounder... It's frustrating...  That's why I fish with smaller friends of mine...lol... Makes the fish look huge...
708946,sconceptor,2012-06-25 12:09:00,146,"Also, to make it look bigger in the photo, hold it out away from your body......it does wonders for fish photos!!!"

709154,Locnar,2012-06-25 20:55:00,645,"Nice fish dude, i also like your style. Holding it nice and close to your body to show the true size of the fish."
709179,Terry,2012-06-25 22:15:00,14456,"I saw the photo and thought the fish looked like 2.5 or 3 lbs I decided to show how small it was   to my surprise it is a lot bigger then I thought   ok the average man measures 2.8"" between centers of his eyes so I did the math  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=bass21.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/bass21.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   nice fish"

709215,Drock6687,2012-06-25 23:48:00,90," yeppers it was in a river,  i think it was just hanging out in some weeds then just came out to feed.  Caught on a rapalla Cracklin Crank,  my favorite bass lure expect the $12 price tag each"
709244,solopaddler,2012-06-26 01:22:00,8605,"Very nice fish, and Terry you've got waaay too much time on your hands."
709299,Cudz,2012-06-26 03:29:00,2652,Nice fish. Love its colours. Reminds me a smallies from the west arm.  I guess that is why they are called black bass. I once caught a 5.2 pound largie and I didn't post its weight because it looked like a 3.5 pound fish.
