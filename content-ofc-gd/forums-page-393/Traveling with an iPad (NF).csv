709253,ketchenany,2012-06-26 01:34:00,3229,I'm going to Europe (Italy) next week for a month and plan taking my iPad. has anyone done the same? I need info about WiFi availability . . . I know that out and about is difficult and non existent. But what about the big cities such as Rome Florence . . . .?  Thanks
709256,Terry,2012-06-26 01:41:00,14456,"most hotels have it, lots of them charge a small amount for it many coffee shops have it too"
709257,iFish4real,2012-06-26 01:41:00,386, I would assume big airports have it and probably hotels too... Best thing when you travel...hook up with some local ppl for guidance
709273,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-26 02:10:00,10439,Don't forget to get a power converter if you plan on charging it up.
709277,Gregoire,2012-06-26 02:18:00,1397,Lots of wifi available in Europe. Search ahead for locations of free wifi in cities that you will be traveling. As was previously mentioned coffee shops can be a good place to find wifi.

709287,Aaron Shirley,2012-06-26 02:43:00,655,WiFi should be available in some areas of your travel. Another option is to take an unlocked phone and get a sim card with a data plan to have internet anywhere you have a good cell signal. It would need to be either an iphone or something like a Samsung with portable hotspot AP that utilizes a WiFi signal from your phone to connect to your ipad rather than a traditional bluetooth tether. You would need to set up a secure connection or anyone could connect to your phone and use your data. Relatively simple to set up. This would add some cost but also give you a cell phone to use for the month.  Have fun on your travels!
709293,cwpres,2012-06-26 03:09:00,14,Large cities should have readily available wifi.  Just be aware that some places may charge a fee.  Here is a coverage map for 2G and 3G reception if you are using that:  http://www.sensorly.com/map/2G-3G/IT/Italy/Three/gsm_22299  Note that iPhones and iPads can get expensive when travelling and using the GSM network.  Safe travels!
