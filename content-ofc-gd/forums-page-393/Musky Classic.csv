For our prize table we will have a St Croix Casting rod (I cant remember the model number) Vhf radio Line Counter reel Scotty orca rod holders and lots of baits on the door prize table.  The Belle River Chapter will as we do each year pay the admission for the kids 1 child per Adult paid entry. If you like to fish with your family this is also a great event for it as it would cost you just $80 for a weekend of fishing for a family of 4 that would include a BBQ Friday night, Dinner Sunday afternoon, and a door prize for each of the 4 family members.  Please feel free to ask for a emailed copy from me if you want to make some and share them at work or in your local stores.  If you have any questions please email me or call Mike D or myself our numbers are on the flyer posted.  "
