709417,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 15:50:00,3525,Thanks Bill!
709419,BillM,2012-06-26 15:59:00,17367,"Anytime man, let us know how you make out"
709433,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 16:17:00,3525,"Might get down Friday, really exited t use it, hey, I might even use it at a local pond!"
709459,pics,2012-06-26 17:24:00,1268,"Shouldn't you be in your parents basement playing video games and texting your friends? What kind of example are you to your buddies?.....  Keep fishing and get some of your friends hooked as well...It will keep you out of trouble(maybe)...lol  Every year we bring a big group of kids from the inner city of Hamilton to Binbrook to introduce them to fishing and thanks to fishing world we provide them with a rod and tackle to go home with. Even if only a couple of them get hooked on fishing then we have done what we set out to do.....Better your parents are ticked at you for coming home late( ""one more cast"" )than the alternative..."
709462,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 17:26:00,3525,"One more quick question, when my dad was buying this he told me that he went for the shortest rod possible ( for travel and weight purposes) now he is asking me if I would like to stick with the 9 1/2 foot rod or exchange it for the fifteen ft, what would be your opinion?"
709463,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 17:28:00,3525, How about 10 more casts   . I have one friend who I'm teaching and he's doing pretty well!
709467,BillM,2012-06-26 17:44:00,17367, 15ft is way to big for any of the rivers around here.   13ft is a good all around length for a float setup.
709470,dave524,2012-06-26 17:48:00,4508,"X2 on the 15' , too long, 13 or maybe 11 1/2 too if you intend on fishing for residents on smaller brushy creeks."
709471,BillM,2012-06-26 17:49:00,17367," Yup, 11'5 would be fine as well..  9'5 is a bit on the short end."
709473,Ralph Field,2012-06-26 17:52:00,1018,"A 15 ft. rod is overkill unless your fishing big rivers all the time. A 13 ft. rod in my opinion is the best overall length for a float rod. A 9'6"" rod would work on small streams but the 13' rod allows you to keep more line off the water giving you a better natural presentation. If you are worried about transportation some 13 or 13'6"" rods come in 3 piece configurations."
709479,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 18:06:00,3525,Thanks!
709202,HTHM,2012-06-25 22:59:00,4082,"I made a smart-alec comment on our status portion of the front page and found out much to my chagrin that I was not wrong. After checking a members profile I discovered that yes it IS his grade 8 grad tonight. Let us all bear that in mind when we enter into a dispute on the board that we are teaching the younger generation how to act like a man. Do we want to teach, might is right and bluster will muster? Or should we teach that a well reasoned argument and a reflective response will get our point across in a better manner? Let us remember that when we run into a ""hot"" topic on the board. We are setting the example."
709204,cwpres,2012-06-25 23:03:00,14,Sound advice!
709206,kickingfrog,2012-06-25 23:07:00,8333,â€¦ and some of us aren't even experts.
709209,Roy,2012-06-25 23:22:00,13728,I was pretty sure that someone would PM you on that bomb.
709210,BillM,2012-06-25 23:23:00,17367,Shouldn't he be outside playing street hockey until the street lights come on?
709211,cheaptackle,2012-06-25 23:28:00,849," This happened with this same lad before, Bill - read his profile - his goal is to become a guide and I'm quite sure he's on this board to learn from his peers and be more involved with the sport.  Michael"
709212,spinnerbaitking,2012-06-25 23:32:00,1622," Street hockey over Fishing, Really, hopefully more of them come onto these sights, only one better place to learn than here & that would be on the Water lol Tight Lines SBK"
709223,nroadrunner,2012-06-25 23:58:00,113,I agree.  however i will add to it.  It should not matter the age of the other member grade 8 or 80 years old we should always be treating each other with respect and dignity.    Thanks    Ian  
709224,mercman,2012-06-26 00:02:00,7054,  Perfectly put Sir.
709226,Twocoda,2012-06-26 00:08:00,4130,He actually surprises me with some of his witty and informed remarks...sometimes i find it hard to believe he is as young as he is....
709240,NAW,2012-06-26 01:19:00,4022,"Wow, I had no idea.  Here I am thinking he's an old fart.."
709245,Nipfisher,2012-06-26 01:25:00,2449,His original introduction presented himself as a young angler. He has also commented on having to ride his bike because he is too young to drive. I enjoy having RHF on here. G-Man has him beat on age anyways.
709250,BillM,2012-06-26 01:30:00,17367, I think you missed my joke
709286,TennesseeGuy,2012-06-26 02:43:00,957,It's never wrong to treat the other person with respect.
709292,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 03:06:00,3525," I watch a lot of John Stewart and Stephen Colbert, and sometimes you just set it up too well! That being said, thanks for the remarks.  AND  I just got my first centre pin outfit as a grad present!!!"
709304,Ben_Daniels,2012-06-26 04:08:00,435,Sarcasm tends to work better in real life as opposed to a messageboard
709369,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 13:36:00,3525, Perhaps this would help?
709373,Harrison,2012-06-26 13:41:00,2202," I wish they were around when I was a kid.  Mom let me watch Bizarre, that explains a bit about me.  Congrats and stick with fishing kiddo, there is nothing like it IMO."
709386,BillM,2012-06-26 14:20:00,17367," I guess you missed it as well.  RHF, good kill on the centerpin!  I'm sure the Credit will never be the same come fall  :)"
709392,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 14:27:00,3525," I can't wait for fall! This crazy idea came to my head this morning, this weekend I think I'm going to try for pike on it!"
709394,BillM,2012-06-26 14:28:00,17367,Get some dead smelt below a float off a deep weed edge.. My guess is that smelt doesn't last very long
709402,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 14:47:00,3525,"That's what I was thinking, there are a few places out in Waterloo area that I think might be worth a check, does the lower credit have good populations of pike?"
709404,BillM,2012-06-26 15:04:00,17367,"Nope, but the lower credit has a decent population of smallmouth bass which would be a lot of fun."
709413,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 15:38:00,3525,"I'm guessing the bait of choice would be smelts, crayfish and shrimp?"
709415,BillM,2012-06-26 15:44:00,17367,"Anything will work below a float, you don't need live bait..  Small tubes, jigs, etc..  Live worms would be the ticket for pretty much anything down there."
