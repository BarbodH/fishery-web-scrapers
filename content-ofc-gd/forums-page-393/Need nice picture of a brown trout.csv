I have fished this stretch of water all my life and never caught or heard of a brown trout being caught.  So I wanted to send her a photo of both a brown trout and brook trout to make sure the story is correct.  So if any one has a nice side shot of a brook trout and a brown trout I could use to send her that would be great.    Ian"
