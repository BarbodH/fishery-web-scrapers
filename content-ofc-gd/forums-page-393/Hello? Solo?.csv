709117,Squid,2012-06-25 19:07:00,1656,Why change the name now? Are you published or something?
709118,Christopheraaron,2012-06-25 19:11:00,3525, He's published enough reports!
709119,Squid,2012-06-25 19:15:00,1656,Hey RHF thanks for responding on Solo's behalf.
709123,solopaddler,2012-06-25 19:21:00,8605," I have been in years past and I will be in the near future.  And yes, that's the reason for dropping the pseudonym."

708317,Christopheraaron,2012-06-22 16:17:00,3525,Anyone seen solopaddler these days?
708318,NAW,2012-06-22 16:18:00,4022,AKA Mike Borger.  He's been around.
708319,Spiel,2012-06-22 16:19:00,9065,"I suppose this is humour but truth is I saw him Wednesday, in person and spoke on the phone with him a few hours ago. Does that count for anything?"
708329,solopaddler,2012-06-22 17:11:00,8605,I figured there'd be a few who might not catch the name change.   I'm here.
708333,jimmer,2012-06-22 17:20:00,2730,Great talking to you the other night. My countdown to Quebec is on!
708335,torco,2012-06-22 17:23:00,656,I would have been lost if you had changed your avatar
708337,woodenboater,2012-06-22 17:32:00,2277,^ this. I was wondering why someone else had the same avatar as solo...
708339,BillM,2012-06-22 17:39:00,17367,"Mike, you should have changed your avatar to really mess with people's head."
708340,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-22 17:41:00,2690,Solo who  How does it feel to be an online celebrity Mike?
708341,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-22 17:44:00,10439, He did change his avatar!! This was the old one.    :rofl2:

708356,solopaddler,2012-06-22 18:32:00,8605," Nice talking with you too Jim. I'll be looking forward to hearing how you make out.  Cheers    Please....direct any questions to my agent.  As far as the name change goes it was a hard decision, but my image consultant  made the call.       Hey thanks for finding that.  On a related I managed to dredge up your old avatar!   "
