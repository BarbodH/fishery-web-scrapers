709297,Aaron Shirley,2012-06-26 03:20:00,655,"I've been out a bit for kings the past while, and doing tournaments with team Striker. It's been a lot of fun! I haven't had much time to get on the web these days to post reports with my heavy work schedule and two kids now. man how life changes quickly. I don't imagine it will get any better with my son now in sports lol. I should be able to boot up my laptop and post reports during the first week of the derby as I'll be off work. I also post a lot of live reports with photos and short videos to Facebook and Twitter while I'm out on the water fishing  The fish this year are a great size and great numbers on the lake. This entire year should be good and the GOSD should see some big fish entered  I've been out with friends fun fishing as well as tourney fishing. Herring strips with a variety of flashers and colours have been good as well as flasher/fly combos. Spoons have also done well earlier, but the flashers have been best the past few weeks.  I will be out a lot when the GOSD starts, can't wait!  I was out on Sunday for a few hours in the morning with a buddy Fred and we had tough fishing off the islands. We got a handful of fish but mostly small. Fred got one good one just before we quit which was nice to see.  Here are a few pics. Enjoy.              "

709368,BillM,2012-06-26 13:32:00,17367,"Aaron, found the fishing off the island/spit tough last week as well.  Warm water all over the place (Guys were seeing 55deg 70-80ft down)  I think we landed 4, all under 4lbs"
709371,Harrison,2012-06-26 13:37:00,2202,"Solid fish Aaron, great shots too.  Good fish off Port Hope and Darlington starting to really heat up."
