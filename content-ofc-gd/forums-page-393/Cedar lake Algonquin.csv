709159,Gregoire,2012-06-25 21:17:00,1397,I'm heading on my annual camping/male bonding/fishing trip with my buddy a week from today. This year we are heading up to cedar lake in Algonquin Park. Just wondering if anyone has any fishing tips. We are willing to do a 2-3 day canoe loop.

709318,Gregoire,2012-06-26 10:44:00,1397,"Cool. I'll bring some worm harnesses and some bucktail jigs, along with the usual cranks, jerks and spoons."
709335,Luke V.,2012-06-26 12:11:00,286,"Cedar lake is great for bass and lake trout.  Little cedar lake (west end of Cedar) is great for bass. Radiant lake has some good fish in it aswell. Hopefully you have some electronics for your canoe. Will make finding the schoals and holes easier. My only tip for walleye on cedar lake is that they are deep in the summer.  Lake trout, jig with spoons. Looking foward to your report. I will be going to Cedar for the 16th year in a row for two weeks on July 14.  If you want to find out the hot spots look for Jake and Bonnie. (they run the brent store) Also look for Gantry he is the park Warden. (his wife runs the gate)   Tight lines,"
