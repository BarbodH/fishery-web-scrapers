Sadly these are the only fish I saw as I was at the Zoo with Family      Zoo was a dissapointment.  time with family was good but if you have a choice go to Elmvale Jungle Zoo much more user friendly  Neighbour wanted to get up early Sunday morning and go fishing.  So I texted him at 5:30am at 7:30 he got back to me. I guess my idea of early and his are different LOL.  So we went for an dhour or so before my sons skateboarding lessons at 10am. Manage 1 smallmouth around 1 1/2 lbs.  Then second fish didn't seem like a bass to me. Called fred to net it as I just had a feeling, wasnt sure what it was but knew it wasn't a bass.  Turned out to be this little beauty    nice pound or so rainbow first I had caught at the dam in many many years  Cheers  Ian  "

709376,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 13:53:00,3525,You should of ditched him!
709387,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 14:20:00,3525," I know. I should be ashamed, but I'm not, if someone invited me and then waited 3hrs to get back to me they'd never hear the end of it!"
709529,nroadrunner,2012-06-26 21:29:00,113,"Waiting for Fred is nothing unusual LOL.  I'm a big boy so I could have left and went fishing at any point.  As for the rainbow guts on manifold that fish went back but maybe the next one won""t and I'll do the Grumpy Old men trick and put in in his backseat.  Truck is a pigsty he'd never find it. lol    Ian"
