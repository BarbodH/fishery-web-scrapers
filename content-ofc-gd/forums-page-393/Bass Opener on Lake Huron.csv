709454,pics,2012-06-26 17:13:00,1268,I happened to be in goderich at the Maitland River(not fishing-out for a drive). What a zoo! Judging by the full stringers of bass the fishing was good. Too bad guys were keeping fish around 12 inches. I wish they would stick to the 2-3 lb fish and let the bigger and smaller fish go...
