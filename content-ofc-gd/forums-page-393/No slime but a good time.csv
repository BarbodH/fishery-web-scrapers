I did not boat any slime but I did get to watch some acrobatics 2nd cast I had a high 30's- low 40"" musky come flying out of the water after it missed my bull dog on the out side turn of my figure 8 it came back and was HOT for 2-3 8's then left. I had two other good follows but no takers.  I did have a few schools of sliver bass hammer my baits it was awesome to have a school from 10-30 silvers chasing my bait on the figure 8. I had never had this many silvers act like that before it was very cool I wish I had my Gopro set up to catch it maybe tomorrow."

708620,Handlebarz,2012-06-24 01:19:00,3790,Brian I hope they are there tomorrow I'm going to see if I can get the Gopro set up just right it will be my first attempt but I don't have the flat lens for the waterproof housing
