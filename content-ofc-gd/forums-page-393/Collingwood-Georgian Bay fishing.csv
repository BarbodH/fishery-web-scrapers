709323,fisher,2012-06-26 11:21:00,451,"Has anyone fished the Collignwood area lately for salmon/trout or any other species?  I am heading up there for a few days and wondering if it is worth hauling the boat to do some fishing.  Haven't fished there in 5 years and did not have much luck then and hoping for some current info on what species may be biting and how to get into them (depth/lure/speed...etc..).  I usually downrig out of Port Credit, so I have all the gear needed for Salmon/Trout but also wondering if there are any other species I could target while there (maybe pike/bass?).  Thanks and have a fun and safe long weekend!  Oh and by the way, I am selling my late mom's 2003 Ford Escape 4x4 which is in awesome condition and only 109,000 kms in the classified section if anyone is interested!"

709440,fisher,2012-06-26 16:37:00,451,"Really?  That is too bad...was hoping the here and there reports I have heard the last couple of years of the fishing improving were a sign that things may have turned arouond.  I would hate to lug it all the way up there and catch nothing, expecially when I am used to fishing Lake Ontario and always hit fish."
709483,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 18:15:00,3525,I'm not too experienced with that area but if memory serves I have caught a couple of resident rainbows up that way.
709542,workwear,2012-06-26 22:08:00,592,if you can launch in midland...go east and there is some decent fishing to be had...towards wabashene
