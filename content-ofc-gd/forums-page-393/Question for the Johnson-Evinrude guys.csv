709574,hawk-eye,2012-06-26 23:34:00,141,Hey guys. I've got an 86 evinrude 40 hp with out power trim/tilt. I am looking to add it. I have found a unit off of an 85 115 hp motor and would like to know if it would fit. I checked part numbers and it looks like the 40 & 50 hp engines came with a different system then the 70 and ups. But from looking at the pictures I've seen of the unit it really looks like it could work. It has the transom mounting plates with it. Do you the the 40 could bolt up to a 115 mounting plate? Any thoughts would be welcome. Thanx.
