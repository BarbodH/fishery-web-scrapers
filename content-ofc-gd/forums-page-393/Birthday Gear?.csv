707462,GreenCanada,2012-06-20 01:37:00,375,"So, my dirty thirty is approaching mid-July and I've been getting asked what I might want from friends/family. I really have no ideas and I don't think that will fly this year. So I thought, why not ask for ideas from my fellow fishermen!  My primary interests are; spin fishing for trout (bass to a lessor degree), photography, hiking, camping, Algonquin Park, etc. I occasionally fish from a boat (canoe mostly) so that has less importance to me. Oh, and I typically fish solo.  So without knowing what gear I already own, or what my biases are (besides the interests above), what would you ask for if you were in my position?  What is something you find invaluable that I should have!  Let's hear your ideas!!!!  "

707481,GreenCanada,2012-06-20 03:49:00,375,"Great ideas so far!  I've considered a handheld GPS. Actually, I bought the eTrek20 from Garmin a couple months ago. I returned it a few weeks later for a few reasons. Mainly, I just didn't like it. Function, feel, combination of factors. My ideal GPS would be waterproof, relatively small and be compatible with very detailed maps (+topos).  Anyone have some suggestions for GPS's that you use for hiking, or fishing a river/backcountry stream?  What brand is your favourite?"
707500,funfishing,2012-06-20 05:56:00,147,"I second the portable depth finder, it will open up lake trout fishing for you up north from the canoe. If you don't already ice fish, voila, you can use it for ice fishing too."

707502,Musky or Specks,2012-06-20 06:07:00,2710,Take up flyfishing I know you have a passion for trout and its a very fun way to catch all fish.
708480,GreenCanada,2012-06-23 04:45:00,375,Anyone have some new ideas?
708482,ccmtcanada,2012-06-23 04:55:00,7971,"Hmmmm...if you fish solo a lot how about a small tripod for those times you get that perfect fish?  I have a small 6"" one with bendy adjustable legs that I can put on any surface...the bow of my boat or uneven surfaces like rocks etc.  I second the waterproof go pro camera as well.  With camping and outdoor stuff as a general interest, what about a good quality multi tool?  Hope you get some great stuff! You mentioned ""spin fishing"" for trout...does that mean you use spinning gear?  How about a centerpin?  I've used a spinning outfit for years and just bit the bullet on a pin."

708512,GBW,2012-06-23 15:56:00,8460,"gps, nope there are good cell's out there with that info other then topo maps.  but some have maps you can buy I understand. rain gear, for sure!  rather be comfortable and fish when you want then be limited to when you can fish. gopro?  I have one and didn't use it that much at all cause I didn't have a chest harnes (but I do now, thanks to Will!   ) so I may use mine more. Knipix cutters are a great tool to have in case you hook into a big'en and need to cut it loose or free a hook from your hand or other parts.  they cut through hoohs like a hot knife through butter. other ideas...  minnow bucket with a pump and you can always use a good spool of line too."
708514,adempsey,2012-06-23 16:12:00,1498,"Camping, fishing, hiking and even photography are not really about the gear, but the experience.  So, IMO, the best gift would be somehow enabling that."
708534,ctered,2012-06-23 18:40:00,40,"Not sure if Algonquin does or not but along the gift card line would camping permit/gift card for Algonquin or another park you would like to try. Forces you to have to go on another trip but some of the cost would be already covered. As far as a gps goes, you had the correct brand just the wrong model. I would look at the 60/62 cx(waterproof but does not float) or a better choice would be a 76cx(waterproof and floats). They all have the same screen size and are color. Garmin has very good topo maps for them as well as hydrographic maps."
708638,funfishing,2012-06-24 02:18:00,147,"A guided trip with either one of the local stream guides, or a salmon/trout charter on one of the Great Lakes. I'd make it Huron, so you can comfortably eat your catch!"
709301,GreenCanada,2012-06-26 03:39:00,375,"Man, these are all great ideas! I like the idea of enabling me to go on another trip, or at least coxing me to make the time in between writing the thesis for my M.Sc. I don't know if I would want the Knipix, but it's likely because I don't want to think about that time I got two treble hooks stuck in the joint of my thumb and had to pull them out with pliers... now that's a story lol...  I'll check out those models of GPS. I do have a Blackberry (don't give me a hard time... haha) but the gps is reliant on the cell signal if memory serves me.  I'll look into the Algonquin gift cert and what it can cover and I'll update those interested.  I'm pretty well versed about my local streams, but would anyone recommend some reasonably priced charters for salmon/trout on Huron or GB?  Thanks again!!       "
