709546,16 Footer,2012-06-26 22:14:00,191,"Lake Dalrymple is a big lake for canoe fishing. If it is not windy you should be ok. Launch near bridge crossing at the narrows, try fishing in the shallow weedy south part of the lake."
709613,Christopheraaron,2012-06-27 01:35:00,3525, My plans change by the hour sometimes. I don't know if I'll go but I just wanted some info on it.
709640,Victor,2012-06-27 02:14:00,1609,The weedflats just north of the bridge is a pretty popular spot for Pike. There should be some bass close by as well. The water next to the bridge looks very good but surprisingly I haven't gotten much out of that stretch.  Have never given a serious effort for the south side (actually called upper dalrymple) but it's not that great from what I hear.
