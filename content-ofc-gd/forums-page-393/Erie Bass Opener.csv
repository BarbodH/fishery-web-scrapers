708555,Pigeontroller,2012-06-23 22:03:00,2793,"Launched at 6am and fished till 1:30pm, Dave and I probably boated 40-50 Smallies, with an average size of 2-2.5 pounds, lost another 20-30...An absolutely great Opener! All fish came shallow, less than 8 fow, most on Xraps, my biggest hit a spook on top, I actually got 5 or 6 on the surface before 10 am while it was still flat calm...The first few hours we were seeing schools of Emerald Shiners breaking the surface and Bass exploding through them attacking...A cast past this and a retrieve through the vacinity usually resulted in a strike! Plenty hit near the boat and at least half the hits we could see, which resulted in many premature hooksets! All good fun!    The biggest, Dave's 4.3 pounder!     "

708817,Pigeontroller,2012-06-24 23:20:00,2793,"Out this morning, same area by myself for 4 hours...Only 4 fish...I guess they got educated yesterday!!!"
708820,kickingfrog,2012-06-24 23:32:00,8333,"The fish were just being thoughtful, they wanted you to rest your thumb and arms."
708960,I'mHooked,2012-06-25 12:44:00,525,Too bad the Musky weren't 4 in 4 hours.  Spectacular day on the opener! Some nice looking smallies!
708961,Billy Bob,2012-06-25 12:44:00,5865,"I use to fish that EXACT same area years ago......when it was easy to cross the Peace Bride back and forth......we always caught our fish using black bucktail jigs....I wouldn't mention how and where as you probably already know and wouldn't be nice to post that kind of info on the internet.  We also got lots of rock bass and MANY perch on some days fishing there.   Good Luck, Bob"
