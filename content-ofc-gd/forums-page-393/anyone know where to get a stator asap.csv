709503,steelhedrmatt,2012-06-26 19:36:00,278, Sandy Cove marine in Barrie used to stockpile tons of old outboard parts.  Dont know if they still do since reopening after bankruptcy.  Might be worth a try.
709520,Pikeslayer,2012-06-26 20:39:00,1443,"Try Dave Sullivan @ City Marine (Etobicoke) 416 207 0344. He's usually got used parts kicking around (I know he's got my used/good stator from my Merc 115 kicking around). Tell him Simon referred you. And if you don't mind, ask him if my boat's gonna be ready this weekend"
