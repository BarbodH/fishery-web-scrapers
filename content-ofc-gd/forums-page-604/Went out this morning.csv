Used the toe warmers I picked up at crappy tire the other day, they worked well (about 3 hours),the sticky patch doesn't stick to the socks well enough to slide them into waders so I am going to sandwich them between 2 pairs of socks next time. the rod ice ups weren't as bad as the other day, I changed over to 6 lb mono instead of braid with a mono leader.
