526969,irishfield,2010-12-09 23:59:00,26272,Be careful of anything with snow on it.. I thought with me leaving the submersible pump on the pool cover that it was stuck there 'till spring with these cold temps. Thought today.. I'll climb on there and chip it out from below a few inches of ice...... the first step wasn't very dry!!!!!!!!
