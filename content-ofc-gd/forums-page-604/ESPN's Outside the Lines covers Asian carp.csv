526779,Sharkbait22,2010-12-09 14:38:00,297,The vid http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=5796372  It will be a sad day when these fish get it the Great Lakes (I'd move out west). Watch the vid.  Asian carp feed at the bottom of the food chain leaving little for other fishes or even zooplankton.  The resultant two chain food web means amazing amounts of Asian carp will likely be produced.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_pyramid This forgoes other links in the food chain and greater efficiency of conversion. Not good.  I hope the power never goes out in Chicago.  What is preventing physically closing off this point of entry? And why not close it? The risks seem too great. They apparently do well in coldwater (Superior?) http://www.glfc.org/fishmgmt/carp.php
