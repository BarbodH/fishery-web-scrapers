526267,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-07 21:07:00,203,"Wow, awesome!!! Would love to get tickets for this"
526270,misfish,2010-12-07 21:14:00,29133,"It,s good news,but lets see the card first."
526271,BillM,2010-12-07 21:17:00,17367,"Oh man, a bunch of wannabe tough guys wearing Affliction shirts will be invading downtown Toronto..  That's going to be a spectacle in itself.."
526273,misfish,2010-12-07 21:20:00,29133,"  Hey hey hey,I like my Affliction shirt."
526276,dobee,2010-12-07 21:22:00,301, lol.. all the woodbridge'ers will be out in full force!
526278,NAW,2010-12-07 21:24:00,4022,  
526283,Terry,2010-12-07 21:41:00,14456,I hope they have a real good card I promised a guy at work I would go with him to the first if ever UFC fight in toronto   I wonder how much this is going to cost???????
526286,Toronto_Angler,2010-12-07 21:58:00,698,The view will be terrible. Its not great views in a small arena to begin with due to the cage and the cameramen blocking. Rogers centre will be worse. Wonder what ticket prices will be.
526288,misfish,2010-12-07 22:01:00,29133, Keep me posted bud if you go.
526304,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-07 22:45:00,4399,Insert big yawn here__________!!!
526306,irishfield,2010-12-07 22:50:00,26272,lol.. yep.. if I wanted to see a fight I could watch them for free every Friday night at the Brule... We always sat with our backs to the wall.
526309,ctdd2006,2010-12-07 22:52:00,531, I was at UFC in Montreal the year GSP was there.  Our seats were about $200/each and we were about ten rows up from floor and I found myself watching most of the fights on the score clock!  Good times though...best live sporting event I've ever been to and I've been lucky to have been to see most major sporting events in the last ten years.  Those guys in Affliction shirts were surprisingly tame and well behaved...everyone was out for a good time when we poured out onto the streets...and I was concerned about that too!  Never saw a single bar fight and we were in lots! Who knows what it would've been like if GSP lost though???
526316,Twocoda,2010-12-07 23:01:00,4130,  im wondering the same thing ...when i went to Buffalo for UFC 7...the tickets were 14 dollars...but there were scalpers out front of memorial statium selling them for 50 and i thought to myself...who in their right mind would pay 50 bucks to watch these fights...ohhhhhh how the times have changed!!!!!
526317,misfish,2010-12-07 23:01:00,29133," A very valueable lesson I learned in my younger days Wayne.   Ah, that way we could see what was coming or going out the window."
526318,irishfield,2010-12-07 23:05:00,26272,"If you wanted to get one going Brian.. you just yelled... ""Hey.. who touched my broad (or beer/smokes/welfare cheque)"""
526322,misfish,2010-12-07 23:27:00,29133," Ya just had to ask,would you like to dance?"
526323,msp,2010-12-07 23:28:00,1336,I can only imagine what will happen in Montreal this Sat. night if GSP looses. I have a bad feeling about this one.
526326,misfish,2010-12-07 23:38:00,29133," I too.  Something about KOS that just puts that dought in yer mind. GSP looks really good. Faster and stronger,but,,,,,,,,,,,,"
526332,Cudz,2010-12-07 23:50:00,2652,"It always scares me a bit when gsp fights.  Ever since he got caught by matt sera.  2 things happened after he got caught.  1. He became less exciting to watch (never puts himself in a vulnerable position and doesn't take chances and rarely exchanges). 2. He doesn't lose.  He is a better wrestler than the wrestlers out there and he has found a fomula to win.  I however never doubt his preparation, ability, heart, and focus.  He is a true athlete."
526337,Twocoda,2010-12-08 00:02:00,4130,"  KOS got his ""mind"" game working on you does he ???"
526338,richyb,2010-12-08 00:04:00,774,GSP will handle KOS easy and then maybe GSP vs Shields for the belt in TO.. .
526345,misfish,2010-12-08 00:16:00,29133," Not at all. Every fighter has his day.    GSP does have the better wrestling skills and like I said,faster and stronger. He will let you move,then counter move with ease. His last fight showed that.   Dont forget,KOS has proven himself,just to bad he,s made himself  look like an    his last two fights. He,s a tough kid.   Going to be a great fight."
526347,Terry,2010-12-08 00:28:00,14456,KOS is going down  hard   now he does have a chance to win  but chances are GSP will not give him the openings
