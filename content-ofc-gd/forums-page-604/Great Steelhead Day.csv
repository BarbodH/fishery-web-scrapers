It was fairly cold at -7 but as the light appeared on the river the bit was ON....   I personally went into high double digits and My buddy Chris went close to 10. Here are some pics from my New Ipod Product  Here are a couple of the better shot,  the rest are on a SLR       A couple of Chris   couple mre of my fish      And Finally my Personal best of 2010     Thanks for looking  Dave"

526028,daryl0815,2010-12-07 00:59:00,225,"Nice Fish and good post! I was thinking about going out this morning, but the cold kept me indoors! I need to man up and get out there tomorrow!"
526043,timmeh,2010-12-07 01:39:00,609,"Good stuff.  I can see from the pics that you guys battled some ice and slush, how bad was it? I'm really hoping the ice can hold off so I can get out this weekend. But I'm not too optimistic about that."
526046,Dutchy,2010-12-07 01:56:00,416,"Great job. You venture out in that kind of weather, you deserve a bunch of fish."

526090,Rod Caster,2010-12-07 04:45:00,5784,"  I hope so, get out there and post more pics Blair. Some of us Northerners live vicariously through these OFC Steelhead reports!!  Your PB fish is a beauty. That'll be in a picture frame by the new year I suspect."
526095,ctranter,2010-12-07 05:51:00,543,"It was a great day, I still can't believe how big Dave's tank-of-a-steeehead was.  The pic doesn't do it justice.  It's the first bow I've seen that literally had the body of a salmon."
526112,tdotfisherman,2010-12-07 12:23:00,317,WOW.. great day guys! Damn.. I need to get out there..
