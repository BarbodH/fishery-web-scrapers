Winter is here in a big way now - we gotta have close to 3 feet of the white stuff on the ground!  Before the snow came though I was fortunate to spent some time this fall chasing esox on Lac Seul.  I'll cut to the chase and get to the pictures!  First trolling fish of the fall.  Great start for my buddy Greg!   Now, I know these pics have been posted here already.  Mike is a good friend of mine and a fellow OFNer but I think they deserve another look!  Mike's first muskie, a real beauty!   The next day he stepped it up and slammed this giant!!         That fish is one of my fondest memories from the entire season.  Something that I know both of us will never forget.  Next up, fishing with my buddy Kyle.  Kyle is straight up good luck!  Earlier this season I took him out for his first day of muskie fishing ever and he boated two.  Fast forward to the fall and Kyle's 2nd day of muskie fishing ever - what do you know - 2 more muskie hit the Beckman for Kyle!!        We had a good weekend and I managed a couple myself.      My buddy Jocko was next up.  We moose hunt together but squeezed in some trolling before the hunt.  Lucky for Jocko, he gets his PB muskie and we harvested a bull moose the following week.      Late season trip with my buddy Chris and he gets this gorgeous pike.  Thought it was going to be a muskie but when a 44"" pike hits the Beckman we weren't complaining!    After that fish we went on a bit of a roll to finish off our season.    And a fatty for yours truly!      One more each before the season was over....      Good times had by all   Time to load the sled up in the truck and hit the ice"

525336,kickingfrog,2010-12-04 20:36:00,8333,"I keep seeing your articles, on the net, in magazines, and you still have time to fish and hunt.  A guy could really start to hate you... but he'd first have to past all the envy."
