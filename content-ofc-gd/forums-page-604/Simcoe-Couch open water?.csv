Appreciate a tip if you got one.  Cheers,  MoB"

526712,BillM,2010-12-09 03:32:00,17367,I wouldn't step out on any ice unless you have a death wish.
526713,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:33:00,26272,I sure wouldn't be in a hurry to hit Simcoe or Couch... a sheltered spot on GBay or small back lake maybe...

It will give you time to back up if something happens.  If for some strange reason you like her, I would advise that both of you should say off any ice."
527047,Master of Bait,2010-12-10 04:48:00,196,"  Nice tip DP - I like that strategy.  So anyone know if there is open water near the Atherly Narrows that would be castable from shore?  As you can see I am desperate here.  Thanks,  MoB"
527057,discophish,2010-12-10 06:20:00,392,Perhaps give Hook & Bow a call in Orillia.  They are on Atherley and I'm sure they would have the info you are looking for.  Trombly's is right around the corner as well.
