526497,irishfield,2010-12-08 18:08:00,26272,Well.. Midland Harbour was wide open at 7:50 this morning when I dropped truck #1 off for service. When I took truck #2 down at 11:20 it was pretty much frozen right across. All it took was the wind to die just a bit and wham... and it's still actually blowing pretty good. Would have been a real surprise if we had of launched at sun up this morning...
