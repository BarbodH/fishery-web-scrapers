525843,Beans,2010-12-06 15:14:00,3339, You might have a long wait my friend...I'm not a fan of turkey...  I'd rather have a nice prime rib roast of beef anyday...   
525912,brickNblock,2010-12-06 17:54:00,598," you know it, there have been days when getting out of the driveway has been difficult with toms the size of well fed porkers.....stubborn and almost daring you to run them over. But come the season they are scarce..lol..they really are...I know a spot tho and..."
525913,BUSTER,2010-12-06 17:56:00,1336,I'll bring the butter!!

526186,lew,2010-12-07 16:52:00,12766,Seems like lots of gobblers around right now and I see them in the fields just about everytime I head down the road. I had 3 in the yard a couple days back and 7 more at the end of the driveway this morning when I was heading into town.  My bud down the road called yesterday to say he had 19 in his front yard
526188,fishing n autograph,2010-12-07 16:55:00,2540,I see flocks of them on my daily drive to and from and at work...surprised I haven't run any over yet
526189,misfish,2010-12-07 17:01:00,29133,"  If you think deer  cause damage,you should see what a turkey in flight can do.25-30 pounds of solid bird,right through the windshield."
526220,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-07 18:20:00,835,"My sister walked up to a flock , picked one up and pet it on the head."
