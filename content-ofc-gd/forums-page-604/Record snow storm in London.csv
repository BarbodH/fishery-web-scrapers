526542,misfish,2010-12-08 20:25:00,29133,"HA HA HA. I use to do the moving of the piles of snow at work once they took up to much of the lot. The company would rent a front end loader and I would spend the weekend taking it to the back. Living only 5 minutes from the plant,I would travel over to our nieghbourhood and move all the high snow banks of friends driveways. Guess someone thought I was a city worker and was wondering why I was only doing a few of the houses. I got a visit by a City of Barrie supervisor,he didnt know what to say,except, you do good work.LOL He never told me who called,but most of us knew.  There was payment of festives for my effort."
526699,splashhopper,2010-12-09 03:02:00,2931," yeah, the EMS guys would want in on the action too!"
526700,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:04:00,26272,They already where Ron.. we rented our back apartment to the ambulance service and they kept the old hearse style machines in our double garage! We had a radio in the butcher shop for when they were all out.. and dad filled in as dispatch.
526702,splashhopper,2010-12-09 03:11:00,2931," dang... how about the beer store delivery truck,  did they just have a regular drop off day or what"
526705,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:15:00,26272,NA..when they couldn't drive anymore they sent me on my bicycle to fill in the little cardboard order cards and hand them to the big man at the LCBO counter....
526714,splashhopper,2010-12-09 03:33:00,2931," Looks like u were trained,hands on, to be in the delivery / transport business early"
526715,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:34:00,26272,Always wondered if they called ahead.. I was never asked for ID ! LOL
526717,BiggFish,2010-12-09 03:46:00,40,"What a good story. Glad to see you can hold your composure. I would have likely flipped the grater operator the bird and he would have snowed me in on even more on the way past the second time.  As for the newfie that just shows good character right there. If the world had more newfies , i mean good guys, the world would be a better place.  Amen, Chad"
526755,SlowPoke,2010-12-09 12:37:00,2984,"Another 6"" of snow overnight.... ho hum"
526758,Roy,2010-12-09 13:05:00,13728," Which explains where the term ""meat wagon"" came from."
526219,splashhopper,2010-12-07 18:18:00,2931,"Went to pick up a guy for work this am.  I got stuck on the side street behind his residence.    Another car had come out of nowhere and I headed to the shoulder to miss him and then he LEAVES!  I am stuck, big time and no shovel  I try rocking the van, but it ain't moving anywhere. I am on top of the snow with the wheels slightly off the pavement apparently.  Called a couple of friends and they couldn't help. ( no tow ropes and too far away)  I say a little prayer and ask my Creator for some SERIOUS help.  Lo and behold, a private contractor grader comes by within a minute or two., but he won't stop to help  A few minutes after that and this nice guy from Newfoundland walks up and offers to help. We try and try and try to get the van out off the hardening snow, but the wheels are just spinning. He is more determined than I am to get the van out! I am thinking I would just go in to the Sally Ann and wait for my buddy to be available to pull me out with his 4x4.  Then, the grader comes back for a second pass and he gives me the two handed halt sign from his cab. Hmmmmm?  He maneuvers that brute of a machine to within a foot of the front of my van, with me in it and the newfie beside the van.  Then he backs up and takes the snow down to the pavement and gets even closer  THEN, he backs it up and does about a NINE POINT TURN and comes at me from another angle !  Everything is cleared right up and all I have to do is move the van 6 inches and i will have pavement under my wheels.  Then the nice newfie jumps outa the van and says, gun it and keep moving.  Nothing for a few seconds, so I rock the van a bit and voila... I am moving forward.  I get the van on to solid ground and give the grader operator the  I ask the newfie where he was walking to in this weather. He says sheepishly: "" the food bank"".  I tell him to get in and coffee is on me.  We grab a coffee and muffin and start discussing the snow storm we are in.  As we pull up to the Foodbank, I see this parking meter.    I wish I had thought to take pics of that grader in action. The operator was a young guy, but he sure knew what he was doing.  What a morning! The talk radio show I listen to CJBK1290 broadcasts out of st catherines and serves their market and ours from 10-12 am. He has callers calling in from London about the storm and I decide to email him a few LIVE SHOTS from my van window.    I finally get home and pull in to our UNPLOUGHED lane and parking area in the townhouse complex I live in.  Two pick up trucks abandoned and blocking most of the skinny ""trail"" in.  I get in the house and decide to take one more pic of our record breaking snow storm.    The snow is still coming down and the forecast is for 20-30 more centimeters today  and then another 15cm tonight !  I guess I am shovelling my wife's parking spot out again this afternoon.  Stay tuned, this storm broke the record we hit in 1977. Somehow that one seemed a lot more fun that this one.  Oh yeah, I was 16 then ! lol  In retrospect while writing this I am grateful for: 1) Asking my Creator for a little help. ( a grader and newfie were there within minutes   )  2) Not flipping the bird to that grader operator when he went by the first time and didn't stop  3) For my giggling daughter and her friend as they enjoy another ""snow day"" at our place today and that I am here to listen to them and all their innocence!  4) And the FREE ADVERTISING the radio host gave me. I emailed the pics from my blackberry and it uses my work address to do so.   How great is my Creator for me this day, and it is only half way done."
526221,10point,2010-12-07 18:23:00,165,I have been hearing about this storm on facebook from my sister in law who has been stuck in her house for over 48 hours. One of my sister in laws was the born the day after the big storm in 77. Looks like a whale of a storm.
526223,splashhopper,2010-12-07 18:25:00,2931," If she needs any help, send me a PM with her number and we will see what we can do for her."

The grader dude  This time I pulled up down the street where he was headed down.  Got out of the van and put my ""stop signal"" out to him... He is trying to wave me off and probably thinking I was a little  I lean back in to the van and come out with an EXTRA LARGE DOUBLE DOUBLE Timmies.... He gives me the   and stops...  I gratefully climb the ladder to his cab and hand it over and thank him for getting me out yesterday.   A few minutes later, he called the number on my van and says: ""Hey, I was dieing for a coffee"" !  How cool was that!"
