526907,Twocoda,2010-12-09 20:49:00,4130,  WOW ...thats only 5 hours of daylight to measure the ceiling height ...NWT must have a gas powered measuring tape
526917,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-09 21:39:00,10439,"  It's done with ""FRIGGIN LASERS"" now. Just ask Solopaddler it's his job at the Hamilton airport. Every hour he takes a reading off the laser thingamawoosamadoodle that tells him the ceiling height."
526919,irishfield,2010-12-09 21:42:00,26272,Is that 'cause he's too out of shape to blow up them ballons Dave.. or too chicken to go out in the cold to launch one...
526921,bigugli,2010-12-09 21:47:00,6138,"When you think back a few years, it is absolutely amazing. There was a time when there was no such thing as enough  snow, let alone too much snow.   The bigger the snow piles, the better the tunnels."
526927,DanD,2010-12-09 22:10:00,2223," OH yea; dangerous as all get-out but they were sure fun to build; when you’re 9, 10 too 16 years old. At the bottom of a 10 foot high drift, dig a tunnel in about 4 or 5 feet and then hollow out a room as big as you wanted. Spend the whole day digging it and then the next morning be pissed to no end that it collapsed during the night. Never once giving a thought of; what would have happened if we were in there, when that 6 feet of snow above us came crashing down. I guess a lot of us are lucky that we’re still alive, with some of the stunts we use to pull. Almost worth a new thread; what’s the dumbest thing you did, when you were invincible? LOL  Dan."
526977,Handlebarz,2010-12-10 00:43:00,3790,My daughter has not been to happy since I bought a snowblower 2 years ago as the snow is packed down to much to make a good hill for there fort I feel bad about that but my back feels alot better when I put the blower away after just 20 min of work LOL
526981,misfish,2010-12-10 00:48:00,29133," We were all superman and spiderman growing up.  Me I was TARZAN,king of the jungle.LOL"
526604,Cudz,2010-12-08 23:31:00,2652,"OK that is enough snow for all winter already.  Amazing what a short drive north of Toronto will bring you. I live on a hill and cars have a hard time getting up all the time.  Even the snowplow was spinning past my house.  He had to reverse and take a run at it while lifting the blade.  I guess that is what happens when you DON'T PLOW MY ROAD FOR OVER 2 DAYS. I don't live on a main road but it is fairly busy.  I guess paying almost $5000 in property tax only allows the road to be cleaned every 60 hours or so.  You should have seen the 4ft wall he put up at the end of my driveway.  OK done my rant.  Having said that, the first plow went by at about 445 today and another just wernt by 6:25 (no plows for 60 hours and 2 in the past 2 hours lol).  I also shot some pretty funny video of a 2010 ford pickup who could not make it up the street yesterday.  I thought it was a 4x4 but it was not.  Best part in the video is when the kid jumps out and tries to put cardboard under the tires for traction.  Problem was he was putting them on the front tires (he finally figured out it was rwd on account that the back wheels were spinning.) lol.  SHot some other vid of snowplow spinning but he had already lifted the blade and was moving fine.  PS it is now 6:30 and a third snow plow just went by."
526605,mercman,2010-12-08 23:41:00,7054,"oh thank god !!! another snow scrooge.I thought i was all alone in here I can live with the snow(barely) but not the stupid mentality of the city, saying because  its still snowing they dont want to send out the plows more than they have to.What the hell do we do if it snows for a week !!!!!!!!!!!! And the plow guy......memory like a cheese cloth.Every year same thing.No houses on the other side of the road, so where does he put the snow IN MY BLOODY DRIVEWAY THATS WHERE. I told him this morning, you don't dump it in the end of my driveway, and i wont take a dump in yours. I feel so much better now,thanks"
526606,irishfield,2010-12-08 23:42:00,26272,"We live in Canada.. drive a 4 wheel drive vehicle or go South! lol  I remember living in Milton on the very end of Graham Bell Crt, 1984. Our laneway was dead centre of the turn around circle of the court and during a week long snow storm (when I just happened to be on the day shift) the entire neighbourhood waited for me to go to work for 7am in the Ramcharger. They all backed into their laneways so that they could take a run to get in my tracks and out to the main street. Then the next monday morning the door bell rang around 7:30 and Leah answered the door.... ""Isn't he going to work today"".. NO he starts afternoons on Wedneday!! LOL.."
526620,BillM,2010-12-09 00:15:00,17367,"The more snow the better, no complaints from me.  I've used the snowblower more this year then I did all of last year."
526626,NAW,2010-12-09 00:23:00,4022,"We should be considered luck.  Look at the folks in Lucan..  153cm, and still falling!"
526627,Cudz,2010-12-09 00:24:00,2652,I am not a snow scrooge.  I actually don't mind it.  I have blown the driveway 5 times in the past 3 days and it is looking to be done again. 7:25 and snowplow went by again.  4th time since 445.  Couldn't get one for 2 days and now 4 in the past 3 hours.  love it.  too funny.
526628,misfish,2010-12-09 00:26:00,29133,"IM LOVING IT. Follow the tracks and well,we,ll see what happens from there."
526631,Twocoda,2010-12-09 00:34:00,4130, you must be talking aboot the tire tracks leading to timmies....where you can spend a buck rather then get a buck...  Couldnt resist Brian
526635,Beans,2010-12-09 00:50:00,3339, OUCH !! and you thought I was a rub-it-inner eh Brian...?   
526638,Twocoda,2010-12-09 00:54:00,4130, at least i never made refrence to brians tree stand as a deer sanctuary...but somehow the deer just knew it was safe to stay there...  whoah!!!!!

526661,Beans,2010-12-09 01:32:00,3339,   You're a good lad with a sense of humour tells your mother...   
526671,Twocoda,2010-12-09 02:05:00,4130,"NO worries Brian...Sammy Davis Jr said it best ..at a Dean Martin ""Man of the Hour "" roast  ""If they aint making fun of ya ....they dont like ya """
526788,Governator,2010-12-09 14:59:00,879,I don't mind the 2-3 feet I've shoveled in the last couple days here (Barrie as well).  What bothers me is when I went to do the garbage this morning and it's -24C outside.  Those temps should be reserved for only arctic folk at this time of year.
526804,Rod Caster,2010-12-09 16:30:00,5784,the more snow we get now the more spring run- off we get later. Low water was a pain this year and a lot of it had to do with lack of snow last year and an early/warm spring.  Anyone else looking forward to spring.... keep dreaming.  I just bought a 4x4 so BRING ON THE SNOW
526811,lew,2010-12-09 17:00:00,12766,"I'm starting to feel guilty here as I sit looking out the window to a bright sunny day with barely 2"" of snow on the ground that's left over from a week ago while I read reports of all you folks up to your armpits in snow.  My almost new snowblower is still sitting in the garage getting all covered in dust and cobwebs and I'm thinking of calling the Toro dealer to see if I can get a re-fund on it."
526821,DanD,2010-12-09 17:25:00,2223,Don’t worry Lew; you’ll get a chance to use your snow blower; it’s not officially winter for a couple more weeks; so don’t be getting rid of her yet. I’m on my third tank of fuel; that’s three times more then I used all last winter. Going to sneak out of the shop early today so I can clean up and move back the banks; so that I can use the whole width of the driveway.  Dan.
526823,lew,2010-12-09 17:33:00,12766," Yeah your right for sure Dan, we've just been very lucky so far and our turn will be coming real soon."
526838,Billy Bob,2010-12-09 18:09:00,5865,Last Wed/Thurs we got 42 inches of HEAVY Wet white puke and then 8 more inches afterward.....and now temps have been around 10-12 degrees.....not good.....a southern vacation could be in the near future...maybe a cruise or Key West.
526840,Twocoda,2010-12-09 18:14:00,4130, After Monday and Tuesday...even the Calander says....W.T.Friday
526850,Spiel,2010-12-09 18:41:00,9065, It's may be on it's way Lew.  http://www.thespec.com/news/canada/article/282531--monster-snowstorm-brewing
526853,stubbex1,2010-12-09 18:47:00,164," I saw that link too, strange the forecast hasn't called for much snow yet.  In my area (woodstock) they are only calling for about 10cm."
526873,Rattletrap2,2010-12-09 19:40:00,1652,"Lew, Be careful what you wish for!!!! I know you are too old and wise to be duped by Mother Nature. She is giving us a false sense of security right now.....then wham! LOL Only about 1 1/2 inches for us too.....but Barrie ain't that far away!"
526888,lew,2010-12-09 20:15:00,12766,I guess our luck is changing Brian cause it looks like us snowless snobs may be getting up to a foot of it on Sunday.  Perhaps I better go find the feather duster and clean off the blower
526892,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-09 20:22:00,10439,"  Stop whining you girlie man!!!!! Please send some snow our way though, there's not enough for comfortable sledding yet (rocks and stumps sticking up in the trails)   "
