As of this morning 75% of cooks bay has frozen over.  Of course this is new ice and not safe as yet but we are getting there!  If we are able to sustain below 0 temps up to Christmas we should be able to get out there over the holidays for some perch fishing.  For those of you unfamiliar with our operation, click on www.simcoefishingadventures.com  We are on predominantley perch on the south end of Cooks Bay, Lake simcoe and the first to freeze and get on the hard water.  We posted a video today on our website and you will see the conditions as of today.  Please call us to reserve a hut if you'd like to get out there.  We will post the progress on ice formation on our site as we go forward, and post fishing updates etc when we get out there!  Tight Lines,  Merry Xmas,  Sandra and Rick, Simcoe Fishing Adventures."
