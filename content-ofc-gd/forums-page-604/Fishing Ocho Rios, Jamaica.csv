526071,Crazyhook,2010-12-07 03:23:00,1154,You can catch cudas and jacks around the pier where the xruiseships dock. White bucktail HHS worked quickly and white with red head minnow baits will do the trick.
526073,irishfield,2010-12-07 03:25:00,26272,If you do go out in Jamaica.. be sure it's a reputable charter and people know where you've gone! I was there in '89.. and it hasn't got any safer down there since..  Most beautiful Island in the caribean sea... but you would never get me to go back.
526195,addy79,2010-12-07 17:29:00,573," I fished Ocho Rios a few years back, had a blast. I passed on the chartered tours as the cost was pretty hefty. I ended up approaching one of the fishermen in his boat along the shore and asked if he would be willing to take me along for a small amount, I gave him $50 which he was very appreciative of. We ended up fishing the reef directly in front of where Dunns river falls flows into the ocean. caught a tonne of snapper, barracuda, etc. great times, only a fraction of the cost too...  there are soo many fish in that water i really dont think it would matter what bait/lures you used. you should also go snorkling along the massive reef. THOUSANDS of fish to be seen!! great time"
