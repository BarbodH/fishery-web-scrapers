525979,FishingTheGTA,2010-12-06 21:53:00,28,"There is an awful lot of misinformation here. I have the best TV ever made the Pioneer Elite Kuro and have yet to see any LCD that's remotely watchable. LCD suffers from poor viewing angles, cartoonish inaccurate colours and motion lag. LED sets are simply backlit with LEDs rather than CCFLs and may some have local dimming which will drive you crazy and some don't they also come in all white or RGB but regardless they are all LCD TVs. OLEDs will be a true LED set but the tech isn't ready yet as even a 20"" is many thousands of dollars. For good information read up at avsforums.com. Just to clarify a 600hz plasma is a totally different specification than a 120/480 refresh rate on an LCD and one has nothing to do with the other. When Pioneer announced they were getting out of plasmas, they lost $500 on every set due to their advanced tech, I bought 4 of them and have turned down $12,000 offers for what was a $7K set."

We were leaning towards an LCD until the saleswoman started asking me questions like how much sports do I watch and about the lighting in the room. She had also mentioned that it had the same life span as the others (LCD,LED) which was 100,000 hours. I was told not to buy plasma before I went looking because of over heating issues. I did ask her about that and she said with the new technology now it isn't an issue. I hope she's right and I did give her the benefit of the doubt because in all honesty, I know nothing about TV technology. Its hard to say from the replies if I made the right decision.We will see I guess.   There are some great deals right now TV's  tho....Wow..   TDunn"

I've had mine a few years and at the time I bought mine Radio Shack carried them. Nothing like listening to a game on the radio when you're working around the house. As far as TV's are concerned I have had a 46"" Samsung 1080P LCD 120hz in the family room for 4 years. It's been a a great set so I just put a 50"" Samsung plasma 1080P 600hz in my game room. We love it but I can't really see much difference between the two in picture quality. The plasma was on sale at Best Buy for around $900, I paid a heck of a lot more 4 years ago for the LCD."

Refresh rate is 600 hz compared with 240 or 120 in the led or lcd.  Lots of natural light I would go with a 240 hz lcd or led.  Looks like things are going the led way these days.  I would spend the extra money to get at least 120 hz.  Makes a big difference. I can't stand watching blurry pucks and players while watching hockey games."

I wanted another set for the family room downstairs so I went out on Friday and bought another Samsung with the same features.

But it's the cables the sales people try to sell you that are the big rip off. There is no difference in picture quality if you use 15.00 dollar connection cables versus the 100.00 dollar or more Monster cables that they try to sell you before you leave the store. I was amazed when I saw this test done by an independent lab that tested picture quality using sophisticated equipment and the picture quality was exactly the same."

525842,Fish4Eyes,2010-12-06 15:09:00,1022,"I have been in the market for a tv for a while now. Just recently I pulled the trigger on a 60"" Sony led. I have read countless reviews about all tvs. They all have their issues. I then quickly realised that warranty is going to be the most important aspect of whatever I purchase. With a little digging around I learned that Costco gives you 3 years warranty if you sign up for their American Express card (2 years without AMEX). 3 years warranty in Best Buy or Future Shop is up to 400+ dollars alone. I have a friend who has gone to Costco after his warranty has expired and they still gave him some money for another TV. You don't get that kind of quality ANYWHERE. Therefore whatever you buy make sure its at Costco (no I am not affiliated with Costco). Keep an eye out for their sales they always have them going on. Even when not on sale, they always compete with Future Shop and Best Buy.  As for deciding on what to get. Make a decision as to whether you want lcd, led or plasma. This should be dictated by where you will be keeping the tv. If it is in a low light level room, then go for plasma. If not then consider lcd or led. If you go with a plasma be very weiry of a reported ""buzzing"" sound. Some tv's have it and some don't. As for brands I would stick to Samsung or Sony. Hope this helps!"
525845,GBW,2010-12-06 15:24:00,8460,I'm not going back through all the posts to read but are you going to hang it over a fireplace?  If so then you have to go with LCD or LED.
525897,wallyboss,2010-12-06 17:26:00,1095, You've go to be kidding me??? Going to HD was almost as big a change as going from B&W to Color.  I cannot watch a hockey game on regular tv anymore. I love what Rogers launched lately the new Auto HD that automnatically changes a channel to HD if that programming is offered in HD. So if you put it on channel 9 which is usually regular programming and that program is available in HD it will automatically change it to HD format.

If you are a fan of CNN or any of the sports news shows, don't get plasma. The sets that have alot of static displays on them are completely toasted. Burned all to heck. My own TV is an LG LCD...I do not have any blurring at all even at 60 Hz. 99% of people could not tell the difference between similar quality plasmas and LCD. Since I am a CNN junkie, plasma will never be an option.  Oh..and as others have said..do NOT buy the stupid expensive cables. They do not do a damm thing. The markup for stores is all in the accesories, not in the sets themselves."

525931,davis,2010-12-06 18:33:00,128,"I went Plasma with a Samsung 8 series. Absolutely love it. It's in the dark basement (even with all the lights on - pots - there's no change to picture quality or any reflection issues) and is mostly used for gaming, sports, and movies. Colours are fantastic - deep and rich, and you can't beat the blacks/contrast on a plasma. It came down to the Samsung or Panasonic G or V series plasma. Burn in is not so much of a concern these days, though they call it Image Retention now - as long as you 'break it in' properly. To be extra cautious, I make sure that I set my sleep timer on the tv in case I fall asleep with a video game on. Six hours of static menus/graphics up on the screen is not good for any plasma.  And you're not doing your HD tv justice if you don't watch how amazing Blu Ray looks. Animated flicks on Blu Ray look so life-like it's unreal. Vids from my GoPro HD camera look amazing.  For basic tv-watching in HD, or DVDs, you'd hardly notice the difference between similar spec'd LCD vs LED vs Plasma in my opinion. Its the stuff that's made to take advantage of the full resolution (like HD video games and blu ray) that really allow the TV's features to shine."
525937,Headhunter,2010-12-06 19:34:00,5703,"Sony outsourced the manufacture of their tv's to Indonesia about 10 years agao. In doing so, they also outsource the manufacture of the components of their tvs... so who ever said earlier in the thread that the only thing left on a Sony TV that is Sony, is the name plate got it partially right... I'm sure they outsourced the making of the plastic plate as well. All this stuff is very personal and the only way to determin what's right for you is to go out there and look at TVs... but that can be problematic as you have to ensure that the tvs are all set up the same way and that can also be a challenge. I have a 46inch Panasonic Viera plasma and to my eye, plasma looks much more organic than LCD... very much like, to me anyway, the difference in sound between a very good vynal audio system and CD's. To my ear, vynal sounds warm and real, CD (digital) sound s harsh and brittle. BTW - my plasma sits right beside 8ft patio windows and we have NO problem with light... they fixed that stuff years ago! HH"
525945,bow slayer,2010-12-06 20:03:00,1074,"Save yourself the time I spent tons of time researching before I bought mine 2 years ago this the same response I got from salesmen,tech geeks,repair shop owners,store owners and internet forums:   plasma is the way to go if you can control the lighting. It has the best colours best picture. As for brands samsung is the best with panasonic second. Actually samsung makes almost all the lcd and plasma panels  for everyone.  I have a 1080p samsung 50 inch  plasma would not trade it for anything. I have 2 buddies who got rid of their lcds to buy plasmas after viewing sports on mine."
525948,jedimaster,2010-12-06 20:07:00,3472,"Plasma will burn images in. but they do play fast motion stuff better than with LCD's. I have both. but an even bigger difference is an HD reciever with either. HD on any Cheap TV will know the socks off ANY tv with just a digital picture. Get the biggest TV you can afford in LED then LCD, Plasma is a big trade off, glare and burn in.  I have a ""0"" permenantly etched into the top right hand corner of my Plasma from watching too many Leafs shutouts.  Go for at least a 42"" 45-50 is perfect. 50 or bigger only if you got a big room and deep pockets. I woudl sooner go with a 40"" LED 3D over a 45"" LCD.  We have a 50"" Dynex, Plasma, 42""Panasonic, Plasma, 42"" Sharp Aquos LCD, and the Sharp is by far the best in terms of picture quality. If the 50"" wasn't burned in we would watch all of our sports on it."
525692,BillM,2010-12-06 01:00:00,17367,"Edge lit LED's are garbage, has anyone actually seen one in person?  I had a Sharp Aquos LED Quattron for maybe a total of 8hrs before I returned it for a 50in Panasonic VT Series.. Not even close in comparison..  As far as picture quality is concerned, plasma still takes the cake over both LCD and LED.  More vivid colours, better black levels etc..  Best bang for the buck TV's right now are definitely Plasmas..."
525696,I'mHooked,2010-12-06 01:03:00,525,"LED is still an LCD display, it's just a different way of lighting the screen.  Traditional 'LCD' use flourescent tubes for back lighting, which require more power & greater tv thickness.  'LED' use the light emitting diodes which consume FAR less energy than flourescent tubes, and allow for the much thinner cross section.  The LED also create darker ""darks"" & brighter ""whites"" which is huge. You'll probably notice that the LED units are providing MUCH greater contrast ratios compared to LCD as a result.  150,000 : 1 on an LCD is pretty good. LED are now getting in to the 3,000,000 : 1 range.  That's a whole lot of better colour & light differentiation!"

How long it would take to make up the savings is anyone's guess..  I suppose it depends how much television one watches. I watch about 20-30 hours per week.  Thanks again folks.   Oh, I forgot to ask what brand!!!!! LOL! That will start up another thread I suppose! I hear SAMSUNGS are great quality and value. A friends said steer clear of LG."

Good luck with your choice but I think that for the most part you won't be dissapointed with anything you buy...it will likely be an upgrade and you won't have 6 other competitor sets in your living room to compare it too.

I think they fixed that problem on the newer models. The LCD is a decent TV with a longer lifespan then the plasma and cheaper on electricity. LED is even better in every way but costs much more. Best bang for your buck? Pick up an LCD on boxing day. They are really cheap now. Make sure its 1080 and make sure its 120 Hz(anything higher is a waste of money I'm told since the TV technology is ahead of the stuff broadcasted. By the time 240 Hz becomes relevant, you can pick up a cheap LED in the future.  HD cable makes a really big difference."

The one I have now lasted 18 months. 6 months before I bought it LG changed their warranty from 2 years to 1. My mistake, fool me once.  BTW After 20 minutes the screen/picture are fine. Thanks goodness for pvr."
525623,siwash,2010-12-05 23:24:00,683,"Hey folks,  Opinions on the topic? Is LED worth the extra? Plasma seems to be the cheapest now but I hear they suck up a lot more hydro..  Thoughts on quality? What would you pick?!  Thanks!!!"
525625,cram,2010-12-05 23:27:00,1733,no idea about LED but btwn LCD and Plasma it'd be LCD for me.
525629,Grimace,2010-12-05 23:46:00,2020,LED is the way to go now.
525630,Billy Bob,2010-12-05 23:48:00,5865, If you get a LCD make SURE you get at least a 120 Hz.....this is a MUST if you watch any sports...it's the refresher rate of the pizels....the 60 Hz refresher rates SUCK for sports......240 Hz is even better but expensive and really not needed.  Bob
525634,mercman,2010-12-05 23:55:00,7054,"LCD. Most human eyes cannot tell the diff between led lcd and plasma so go for the economics.LED is a newer technology there fore more expensive.The image creating surface of LCD consumes less power than plasma,LCD displays last up to 60,000 hrs while most plasmas last up to ,20,000 hours. 1080i or p. All HD TV programs are broadcast in 1080i. The only true source of 1080p are some video games and Blu-Ray dvd's. LCD's are cheaper than Plasma for similar size TV's. I have a 47in LCD in my living room, and a 56in rear screen LCD projection in my Theater room, and they both give excellent crisp high resolution images. But the best way to choose is go to a showroom and look at them side x side. Make your own choice and don't listen too much to the salesman.Best Buy is a good place to get info. The salesmen aren't on commission and are usually willing to take time to show you around."
525635,Billy Bob,2010-12-06 00:02:00,5865,Whatever you do don't listen to mercman about big screen TV's......he really has a large magnifying glass in front of his real old 13 inch Philco........
525636,uglyfish,2010-12-06 00:02:00,981,the amount of natural light in the room u plan on having the tv in will also play a factor.
525640,mercman,2010-12-06 00:08:00,7054,"  BB, if you put 3 sets side x side, you'd be hard pressed to tell which one is which.The human eye is not sensitive enough to distinguish the kinds of differances that each produces. I watch hockey and soccer on my LCDs at 60hz and its great.Our eyes and brains have been watching 60hz since the dawn of time, and are adapted to accept the images produced.And our eyes get worse as we age,so if your not a spring chicken whe waste the money on 120 or 240 hz  IMHO that is."
525642,mercman,2010-12-06 00:09:00,7054,  bite me BB just sayin....
525644,Billy Bob,2010-12-06 00:13:00,5865,LOL
525646,siwash,2010-12-06 00:15:00,683,Great info guys! I have heard the same about the 120hz over the 60  soemoe posted about natural light.. what about it?  My condo faces east so less light in the afternoon or eve when I will watch most of my tv.. in fact I am not home all day so not much natural light time!!  thanks!!

525649,siwash,2010-12-06 00:16:00,683,And one nice feature I noticed about the LED is the thinness! It's so sleek.. save a bit of space I suppose
525651,Billy Bob,2010-12-06 00:17:00,5865, Have to disagree on this......I have 2 that are 60Hz and they suck on fast movements.......want a good easy test.....put a 60 Hz TV on ESPN News and watch the bottom line that is moving....the letters will be a little fuzzy compared to letters (type) that are not moving..not so on a 120 Hz TV....
525658,mercman,2010-12-06 00:24:00,7054, then we should change your name to hawkeye !!!! i betcha thats not all thats fuzzy   xoxoxo

525661,mercman,2010-12-06 00:26:00,7054,  plasma screens are normally made of glass or another reflective material while lcd and led are usually plastic no reflective material. Less glare in hi lite situations.
525662,Billy Bob,2010-12-06 00:27:00,5865, About 10 years ago I had Lazik surgery from world renowned Canadian surgeon Andrew Taylor...I'm still 20/15....
525663,cram,2010-12-06 00:28:00,1733,"The natural light is terrible with plasmas.  All you'll see is glare.  Unless you're in a basement with no windows, don't get a plasma."
525666,mercman,2010-12-06 00:29:00,7054," if you got the bucks, then go for LED.if budget is an issue, go lcd, and to make BB feel better go 120Hz"
525669,mercman,2010-12-06 00:30:00,7054,"  dont say things like that BB, im gonna get into trouble if i say what im thinking right now"
525670,Billy Bob,2010-12-06 00:32:00,5865, You will have to spell it out.......I don't speak Canadian...LOL
525672,mercman,2010-12-06 00:33:00,7054,  silly little man
525687,toca,2010-12-06 00:55:00,274,plasma looks alot better but it really depends on the brand/model.  find the colors look way better/sharper/vivid
525690,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-06 00:59:00,10439,I did a lot of research and in store comparisons of TV's before I bought my new set last month. I watch a lot of sports including a ton of racing and I brought a DVD of one of the races with me to the store so I could compare the different units. Even with 120 hz refresh rate LCD's I could see motion blur. I even noticed it on some of the 240 hz units. I did have reservations about glare on a plasma but I just thought I would close the blinds. Between this and the special coating the plasma unit I bought has on it's screen it is a non issue. I spent my $$$ on a good quality plasma and I'm happy I did. I ended up with This Panasonic Viera TC-P50G20 50' plasma. After a month of viewing I can recomend it.
