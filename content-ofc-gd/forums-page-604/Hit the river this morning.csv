Question for the cold weather fisherman ... is there anything I can put on my rod eyes or line to prevent them from freezing up every other cast?  here are a few pics from the morning    "

525694,Twocoda,2010-12-06 01:02:00,4130,you might want to grab some hot shots (for in the waders)... happy warm feet for the kid will make for longer excursions  Good Luck and good on ya ...hope the two of you get into them

I just deal with the ice on the rod tip...pain in the butt but I may just try some of that paste someone drifter posted about.  WHen he hooks his first in the rivers, he'll be hooked forever...took me 6 outings before I even got a hit...a few more before I landed one.  Thanks for sharing!"
525870,brifishrgy,2010-12-06 16:21:00,559," great idea, even better is they are on sale at Crappy Tire this week, 10 pack toe warmers for 7.19, going Tuesday morning to test em out and if they work well going to stock up for the winter"
525880,Guest JPCT,2010-12-06 16:39:00,0, You shoulda stayed till around 11  I got there around 10:30 and the bite turned on. It was on fire till about 3pm..  Got a few cohos upstream from those pics

526000,Victor,2010-12-06 23:18:00,1609,i use vaseline and it works quite well.
