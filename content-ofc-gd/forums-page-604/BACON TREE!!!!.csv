They are about to just lie down and wait for death, when all of a sudden Luis says.........        ""Hey Pepe, do you smell what I smell. Ees bacon, I theenk.""        ""Si, Luis, eet sure smells like bacon. ""        With renewed hope they struggle up the next sand dune, & there, in the distance, is a tree loaded with bacon.        There's raw bacon, there's fried bacon, back bacon, double smoked bacon .. every imaginable kind of cured pork.        ""Pepe, Pepe, we ees saved. Ees a bacon tree.""        ""Luis, maybe ees a meerage? We ees in the desert don't forget.""        ""Pepe, since when deed you ever hear of a meerage that smell like bacon...ees no meerage, ees a bacon tree.""        And with that, Luis staggers towards the tree. He gets to within 5 metres, Pepe crawling close behind, when suddenly a machine gun opens up, and Luis drops like a wet sock. Mortally wounded, he warns Pepe with his dying breath,        ""Pepe.. go back man, you was right, ees not a bacon tree!""        ""Luis, Luis mi amigo... what ees it? ""        ""Pepe.. ees not a bacon tree. Ees            Ees            Ees            Ees            Ees a ham bush...."""

526698,ctranter,2010-12-09 02:54:00,543,I am thoroughly disappointed.  Now all I can think about is decorating the tree with bacon.  Why didn't anyone think of this sooner?
