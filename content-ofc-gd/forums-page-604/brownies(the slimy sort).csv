525135,Gerritt,2010-12-03 23:59:00,6129,They let you fish in the marina? Safe to say all the boats are removed and no one harassed you? That place is covered with signs saying no fishing..  Mind you I think Spiel and I hit it when it was froze over..  PS. Nice Browns!  G
525139,miller,2010-12-04 00:17:00,223, boats have been out of the marina since the beginning of november and they take down the no fishing signs until spring when everything starts goin back in.
