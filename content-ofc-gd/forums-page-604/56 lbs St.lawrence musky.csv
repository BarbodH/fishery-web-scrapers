525905,Aaron Shirley,2010-12-06 17:35:00,655,"All I gotta say is, that is one ginormous muskie! I'll be dreaming about a fish that big now all week!"
526018,tonka-toy,2010-12-07 00:27:00,139,"There is an article posted on musky hunter about the fish. (don't know how to link it)First time musky angler on a charter,they tried to revive her but no go.Good read."
526202,Dano,2010-12-07 17:45:00,719,Right back at ya handsome......
526292,cram,2010-12-07 22:20:00,1733, do fish do that? I always thought fish were unlike us in that way -- that're healthy reproducers until the end.
526298,splashhopper,2010-12-07 22:35:00,2931,"holy ""cow"" ... that must have been fun"
526366,moemoe,2010-12-08 01:42:00,352,"Heres some better info and pics of the fish, unfortunately sometimes this happens when you try to release fish, I fish for salmon, but believers and spoons is something I've never heard of http://www.fishinfo....ticle_612.shtml"
525322,tonka-toy,2010-12-04 19:54:00,139,"Anyone have anymore info on this fish?Musky hunter has a thread with a link to some pics(don't know how to attach them).It says it was caught and kept on nov 30,and weighed just over 56 lbs."
525324,misfish,2010-12-04 19:57:00,29133,Is this what Andy was talking about?
525326,tonka-toy,2010-12-04 20:03:00,139,huh?

525337,misfish,2010-12-04 20:37:00,29133,"Thought I seen a post from Andy ,asking about a big musky thats all.  Big fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
525340,tonka-toy,2010-12-04 20:41:00,139,I was thinking I had missed a post or something.
525341,tb4me,2010-12-04 20:42:00,3295,What a beaut fish! Thats sad that it was kept..there should be a law protecting thsoe...wow
525411,Musky or Specks,2010-12-05 02:12:00,2710,Who knows if it would see another spawn Damn big fish I'd have problems putting it back with all the skeptics out there.
525414,Muskieman,2010-12-05 02:18:00,2472,Beauty..    Randy 
525420,livinisfishin,2010-12-05 02:33:00,661, With him gone this will give another smaller fish a chance to get bigger.
525446,timmeh,2010-12-05 03:31:00,609," Unfortunately this is a common misconception. Removal of large fish does not guarantee smaller fish will take their place. Just as in people, genetics play a significant role in determining the size a fish can grow to. Some fish can grow to trophy stature while others just never will.  It's a beauty fish and as for keeping it, well... I'm sure there will be many differing opinions on this."
525491,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-05 14:07:00,0,Wonder if he knows Dale...
525492,Muskieman,2010-12-05 14:34:00,2472,
525495,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-05 14:38:00,0,  Better picture eh. Right close to the body. That other guy in the other picture could be the size of Roy eh....   
525516,glen,2010-12-05 15:50:00,2641,I hope they ate it.
525525,Dano,2010-12-05 16:15:00,719," Well, thats the thing isnt it? Personally I could not care any less what other people would think or believe,and find this a poor excuse to keep a fish. You want it on your wall or want to eat it for some strange reason, that is your business. Imho, these are more acceptable reasons to keep it than to say ""but no-one would believe me....sniff"". Besides, not much amuses me more than seeing all the rabid infighting and accusations that usually accompany these type of monster fish announcements...."
525550,Ron,2010-12-05 17:12:00,1683," Hey, nice avitar!"
525554,muskymatt,2010-12-05 17:30:00,2608, another cheap shot.  
525556,muskymatt,2010-12-05 17:32:00,2608,"Wow, nice fattie...he's well within his right to keep it.  After batteling the VHS virus for years you would think putting those back would serve the population better, at least for a couple more years."
525571,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-05 19:32:00,0, Don't get me wrong It's a Big Fish! I'm just wonding if they might have put pants on it when they measured.  Just havin some fun Matt...I sure don't catch em that big.  Last dead giant I saw had an attempt at measuring it..        I'm thinking maybe VHS had something to do with this one. We shot some Carp down there that looked the same color and were dieing. I said the same thing to someone once but those Historians don't wanna listen eh..  
525610,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-05 22:39:00,0,"perhaps it was hooked bad and wouldn't have survived anyways!  would you guys jumping all over this put back a fish that seemed to be mortally wounded?  also, fish of that age and size are often beyond their years of prime reproduction, often devoting their precious energy to maintaining their mass as opposed to egg production.  give the guy a break!  jealousy is an ugly trait."
525626,Muskieman,2010-12-05 23:38:00,2472,"I once spent 30 minutes in COLD waist deep Fall water, trying to release a 50"" and was unsuccessful  , it ended up being smoked table fare and was disgusting.. I was not gonna let her go to waste , try as I might  to consume more .. but, about 6Lbs of Muskie Meat ended up in the trash.  Stuff like this happens all the time..It's not like clubbing Baby Seals or anything like it.   Randy "
525632,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-05 23:52:00,0,  Fish like the one in your picture Randy get eaten all the time. Maybe it was something in the way you smoked it because there'd be none left if everyone knew what they taste like.
525643,Muskieman,2010-12-06 00:13:00,2472,  My wife's Granddad smoked her in an Applewood mix and some sort of Maple brine...CRAZY Sweet/Salty it wasn't good at all.. But... on another occasion I put it on a Cedar Plank on the BBQ with some Lemon/Garlic/Dill and was FANTASTIC!! I used to work at a lodge on the upper French and have cleaned and eaten many o' Muskie... It breaks my heart every time.  Randy
