We are going to need a good rain to help smooth it out. I will try and get a photo tomorrow. Walked out 100 yards today 5-6"".It froze as the wind just kept blowing in more slush.                '"
526997,Bernie,2010-12-10 01:59:00,3190,Thank you for the pics Nipfisher. Was talking to a friend that lives on Fish Bay. He said it was open in the center yesterday and the wind was keeping it open. Calmer winds and cold temperatures will certainly take care of that. Glad to see there is little snow on the lake. That will help things get thick in a hurry.
