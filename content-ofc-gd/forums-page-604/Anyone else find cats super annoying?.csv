525000,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 17:25:00,5784,"So my father was working at my condo yesterday and after a few hours he realizes he hasn't seen the cat in a while. He looks in the cubby's, in all the rooms, in the hallways and every single floor. Thinks to himself ""poop, I just lost the cat""! He runs to my aunts and phones me : ""I think your cat ran away, but i don't know how. I feel really bad, what do you want to do?"". I tell him don't worry, I'll go to the condo to double check. My dad isn't accustomed to cats and I know this....I walk in the condo, look to my left, then right and see a cupboard door partially opened... I peek in and sure enough behind all the stuff are two glaring eye balls. I close the door again and walk out. Cat found!  Back on the road I see my dad's truck turn the corner towards me....with TWO cops flashing lights behind him. They pull him over right in front of me. I pull over as well to watch the action. They eventually drive away... They saw him driving fast and over a shoulder (while taking a right turn at a light). He told them the cat story and they let him off. He was REALLY concerned and a bit distraught apparently. hahaha..nothing like watching your father get pulled because of  a sneaky cat"

Guess how much fun it is being glued to your nutbar cat.  Just keep away from the fully operational rear slicers and you'll be fine.  We learned that the falsies came off in a couple of days.  But, I've got some comfy leather furniture and that's why I locked out the doors to living and dining room. So, we've gained a kitten and lost 300 sq ft of living space?  Neuter time came and went, and so did those front slashers.  Indoor cats will survive declawing - those razors are only needed for executing the finches, robins and songbirds in your backyard.  She's still a nutbar that follows humans, pets herself on your foot, helps folding the laundry and opening mail, and will fetch for hours.  I like dogs a bunch.  There are stupid dogs, and stupid neurotic cats as well.  This one is a good kitty."

My dogs stretch out their food until they catch the fleabag's face in their bowl. My little jacks are far better at being ratters than the cat.  The only time I really find cats annoying is during CFL season.
524908,bigugli,2010-12-03 11:54:00,6138,"If it is shiny, or rattles, a cat will chase it. Nothing more disturbing than trying to unhook a cat stuck on 4 barbs of a rattling rap. Someone left it rigged on the rod, and kitty thought it was a great toy. Guess who let me know their was a problem;   the Dog. She just kept howling and running back and forth to the stairs until I went downstairs to check it out. As for the culprit, I never saw my daughter ever want to actually kill her brother until then. I could have used as many stitches as the cat got after releasing the poor thing from the lure.  By the way, both animals are stupid enough as to love chewing on my feet when they are bored."

Only the half that housed the nail was removed, got them done the same time I had them spayed/neutered.  No worse for the wear, were playing like idiots when I brought them home from the vet..  I'm definitely a cat person, dogs are way to needy...  I can leave them home for 1-2days with sufficient food/water and I don't have to worry about them.

If the darn thing paid rent or cooked a meal once in a while I'd let it off the hook, but right now it's just a  nuissance. Once I get an acerage, bring on the cats for mice, the dogs for safety and hunting and the outdoor rabbits to make the girls go ""awww"". Why get a pet if it's less than ideal conditions for it? I think that is my overall issue with cats right now."
524558,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 14:41:00,5865," I have to disagree.....never seen a cat retrieve a duck, pheasant or anything else for that matter. Dogs are used to rescue people and help aid the blind...dogs are used to patrol the peremittor of a fence in area...dogs are also used to sniff out drugs and work hand and hand with our military and police forces around the world....never see a cat do any of that....."

524009,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 19:30:00,5784,"  The declawing thing is out of necessity, because if it claws my new bed one more time it's capa will be detated. I'll look into that soft claws product, maybe it's easier than cutting the nails every few days?? As far as the owner thing...it's definitly more partial to my GF (duh) but it rather likes me and will glady cuddle with me. It just MEOWS whenever it slightly disagrees with something or wants something or someone farts in venezuela. Maybe you are right and it is bored, it's been fixed or spayed (not sure which is which)... what's a good toy that doesn't involve human operation? Do cats like T.V.?"
524011,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 19:33:00,5784,"  Hahaha, that's my own diagnosis. I'm no scientician, but that would explain a lot."
524012,Headhunter,2010-11-30 19:37:00,5703,"I found that a reasonably price squirt gun can humiliate a cat faster than anything... and it only takes a few squirts for it to realize who's really the boss! (Note - Don't let ""the boss"" see you doing it! )LOL HH"
524013,mercman,2010-11-30 19:39:00,7054, WABBITS !!!!!! Hasenpfeffer!!!!!
524014,mercman,2010-11-30 19:43:00,7054, Theres a book at Chapters i saw the other day called 'Should I declaw kitty?' by Claude Bawls. ya might wanna get a copy.
524015,bare foot wader,2010-11-30 19:45:00,1354," soft claws is about 25 bucks, trim the claws and glue on these rubber caps...first time or two is the roughest, cat will try and bite them off but then just gets used to them and the glue will hold them on for a few months...then just trim and reapply  my cat loves birdwatching through the window...ha...but he still does his ""night time olympic training""...a wee bit possessed at night but otherwise he's a chilled out cat.....if you splurge on one of those climbing stations that'll direct it's attention a bit...but they're crazy expensive and you could build yoru own....just a handful of toys around teh house will keep it busy  the ice fishing rod with a cat toy is kinda fun too"
524016,bare foot wader,2010-11-30 19:48:00,1354,"  i already got his balls cut off so figured i'd let him keep his claws...lol....he doesn't really destroy anythign, far less than my childhood dog did anyways"
524020,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-30 19:53:00,203,"  If he's talking about a Golden Doodle, they are indeed great dogs! Would love to get another one! Here's a pic of my dog Shady, fishing of course    But there is many different types of hypo allergenic dogs. Labradoodle, snoodle & many more"
524024,Terry,2010-11-30 20:04:00,14456," dang I hate it when people steal my line...LOL   but they really do make good bait          <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=catwater.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/catwater.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    my livewell for bait <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=BengalKits.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/BengalKits.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
524026,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 20:15:00,5784,Hahaha.  Musky bait makers: take note of the big blue eyes and deep brown stripes. That first one sure looks like it's got nice action!
524028,torco,2010-11-30 20:23:00,656,"My cat likes the TV. All you need is a nature show or anything with birds. She sits there forever watching the TV. I actually think they sell a dvds for cats at the pet store.  Cats vs dogs. The cat is definitely a low maintenance option. If we want to leave for the weekend, the cat survives fine in the house with some food, water and litter box.  She also costs alot less than my German Shepherd, who needs special food, more expensive toys etc. But don't get me wrong I love her all the same, she is a wonderful dog, loves the family and keeps the house well guarded. Honestly if I had a bigger house, more time and a bit more money, I would get a 2nd shepherd."
524030,Headhunter,2010-11-30 20:26:00,5703,This thread is just so full of WIN!!!!! Love that pic Terry!!! HH
524035,GBW,2010-11-30 20:35:00,8460,"Terry, do you let the cat drift back on a board till it get's far enough out and then pull the board out from under it?  I hear that add's to the action due to the shock of what just happened to me thoughts running through the cat's mind."
524039,Terry,2010-11-30 20:41:00,14456,"no the one in the water is being pulled by it's collar  I sometimes put a spinner blade on the collar for more splash and I just troll it at 4 MPH  the smaller ones I hook through the lip, for more action and they work best casting them and working them as a jerk bait  take very long pauses between jerks. they have there own natural action that drives muskie crazy"
524040,MCTFisher9120,2010-11-30 20:42:00,3761,"Our cat does that sometimes, we just blow air from a deep breath at it and it stops doing it.....works for us."
524042,vance,2010-11-30 20:51:00,719,The closest I ever came to being killed was when I suggest the sister's rat on a rope(dog) was only good for Muskie Bait   vance
524053,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 21:17:00,5784, Good one. I'll try that. Still that means I have to put my laptop down and miss a few seconds of OFC action.  Are cabbits real? Maybe they don't MEOW...that could be  good overall fix.
524054,tb4me,2010-11-30 21:17:00,3295,Dog person here..We are all allergic to cats and my husky hates them(took a claw in the eye as a puppy) Needless to say if you want to be rid of the cat just toss it in my yard..Problem solved!!!
524056,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 21:21:00,5784,  hmmm... all I need is a good backstory such as: I was taking it over to the cat spa and I guess they let some dogs in....
524107,Daplumma,2010-12-01 01:38:00,1961, Fine lookin pup you have there.Mine is the most intuitive trainable dog I have ever had.

524141,Rod Caster,2010-12-01 03:28:00,5784,  Mike P: Mercman will order a dozen of these if you make them.

523914,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 13:50:00,5784,"So my GF has a cat that is clinically bi-polar (my assessment). Last month it would try to scratch my eye balls out at every opportunity and now all it does is whine and cry and is a giant..well..pussy cat. Wake up in the morning..meow! Jump in shower...meow! eat b-fast...meow! so on and so on. Drives me MAD! Of course she defends it and treats it like a wittle baybee...and I'm the insensitive clod who wants to put a rag of ether on its cute little face. I know you can declaw cats..but can you de-vocalize them as well? Go ahead and laugh, I know it's funny...but some of you must feel for me."
523916,Roy,2010-11-30 14:01:00,13728,Enjoy the cat. You haven't got kids yet.
523919,adempsey,2010-11-30 14:05:00,1498,"I had a similar problem with my girlfriends cat.  It would be purring one second and then try to scratch my eyes out the next. I think it might have had to do with it wanting to be an ""outdoor"" cat, but we kept it inside since we lived in an apartment.  Anyway, we got married and she got pregnant and the cat had to go due to potential issues with the baby.  So, you could always get your girlfriend pregnant,lol!!  Of course, it could make things worse since pregnant women aren't supposed to change kitty litter...I had to do that for 9 months as a result.  Anyway, IMO, cats all have different personalities.  Not all are so annoying.  I still don't want another one."
523920,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 14:05:00,5784,Kids I can understand...I have way more patience for a child than a cat. You can teach children at least.
523922,Harrison,2010-11-30 14:06:00,2202,"I had a kitten for 18 hours once, she then went back to mommy and the food/bowls/litterbox went back to the store."
523923,John,2010-11-30 14:08:00,2956,Hopefully the GF will make the right decision....
523924,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 14:11:00,5784,"HAHAHA i just noticed the ""curiosity killed the cat banner ad"""
523929,cuzza,2010-11-30 14:18:00,467,"I like cats - we have 3 and they're great companions and by having more than one they entertain each other. Roy makes a good point about kids (we don't have any), if you can't hack a friendly meowing cat, good luck if you ever have a screaming baby  Oh, and de-clawing cats is brutal IMO"
523930,jbailey,2010-11-30 14:19:00,866,"cats can be very annoying! some small dogs as well, don't get me wrong dogs any size barking is obnoxious but that loud pitch from small breeds is the worrsssttt"
523933,mercman,2010-11-30 14:27:00,7054,they make great muskie bait i hear. ....well ! thats what i heard  
523934,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 14:31:00,5784,"  I've suggested that many times, but she won't let me paint it Firetiger colours."
523937,mercman,2010-11-30 14:40:00,7054,  i also heard its hard to get them 3 feet below the surface too.
523938,torco,2010-11-30 14:47:00,656,"I love cats myself. I have always had one. I know they say keep them indoors but I found them to be happier when outside. Of course it helps if you live on a very quiet side street.  Cats need stimulation just like dogs or children. Get the cat some toys that she likes and a laser pointer and I bet you will find it is less annoying.  As for cats and babies, we have 8 month old and the cat has not been an issue at all. We were worried at first because people say they try and get into the crib but our cat mostly avoids the baby and never tries to get in the crib. Only time I have found her in the crib is when our dog chases her and she hops in.  We also have a 2 year old german shepherd. We worked our way up to children, cat year 1, dog year 2, baby year 3 and my wife is already talking about having another. No one wonder I have less and less time to fish."
523941,NAW,2010-11-30 14:59:00,4022,"I'm a dog person myself.  I've had cats, several cats, growing up.  I simply just don't like them.  Thankfully my wife is very allergic to cats, and shares my dislike.  We have a hipoallergenic, non sheding dog.  That doesn't bark, and always follows our commands. Couldn't be happier.  As for your problems with the thing not shutting up..  I'm not sure how to solve that one man?  I trained my dog to be a quiet animal, she only barks when she feels danger.  I don't know if you can train a cat to stop making useless noise??"
523945,ctranter,2010-11-30 15:20:00,543,"I love cats, they taste great!"

I had to hide it in the closet or the cat would simply go nuts! Many an hour spent together, with me laughing my    off at that cat jumpin all over trying to get that pouch. Burning it across the floor... LMAO! Like so many things in life, you can fight them or you can take advantage of their attributes and use them to your advantage. HH"
523948,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 15:28:00,5784,"  Is it some kind of large poodle mix? My GF's mother has a golden retreiver/large poodle mix and what a wonderful dog! Smart, quiet, obedient, hypoallergenic and soft as anything... perfect pet imo.  I agree with all that said that cats like the outdoors...we let this cat out as much as possible, but now that's it's below 0, even though it's layered in fat and fur, it comes right back to the door and MEOW!!!  If it killed the squirels and mice I'd admire it a bit but man, what a useless waste of money for on demand affection (if it's in the mood). Does the cat count as a non-perishable food item for the food drive??"
523949,Beans,2010-11-30 15:32:00,3339,   I would imagine they would taste like rabbit...???  
523950,Rod Caster,2010-11-30 15:32:00,5784,"  HH  your right, I tried that for a bit. I found a  12lbs flurocarbon leader for stealthiness and lime green imitation mouse tied by the tail with a uni-uni knot (no hooks, I promise) really got it going. It was fun watching it do flips in air and running full tilt...but as soon that's over and I get bored of looking like a tool...MEOW!"

My biggest peeve with cats, are also the owners who don't clean up after them - ie. vacuuming their hair on the furniture/rugs so that it ends up on my clothes when I'm over...  Also the fact that they are completely useless domestic animals fuels my hatred."
523963,dobee,2010-11-30 16:33:00,301,hate cats.. thats why i got myself a rabbit  no meowing no barking..

Ours were outdoor rabbits and we'd let them run out of cage during the day and all we had to do was clap and they'd run back in the cage like well trained soldiers. It was great! I had an indoor one once, but that wasn't quite as smoothe."
