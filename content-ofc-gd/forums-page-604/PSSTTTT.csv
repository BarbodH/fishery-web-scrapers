526175,Fang,2010-12-07 15:56:00,1330,I think I counted a total of 18 flakes on the driveway last night in Oakville. Cold and windy but so far no snow.
526178,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-07 16:23:00,203,"It's been snowing here off & on for the last couple of days. We haven't gotten as much as London but almost 30 cm. I say bring it on!!!!    I'm having a blast ripping around the trails on the atvs & going to work on getting the snowmobile going soon!  I'm just worried about the lake not freezing properly  As for clearing the snow, this usually works. Training my daughter young hehe  "
526179,tb4me,2010-12-07 16:26:00,3295,We got about 10cm here in Brantford lastnight. Just enough to make the husky happy!
526181,lew,2010-12-07 16:36:00,12766,  Now THAT'S some serious snow clearing gear
526210,OhioFisherman,2010-12-07 18:04:00,6623," LOL, funny how that snow machine works, my oldest daughter lives in Sheffield Lake Ohio, with one house between her and Lake Erie, and she can still see her grass, just a dusting up there. 25 miles south of the lake we got dumped on."
526238,doubleheader,2010-12-07 19:07:00,497,"Here in western PA we have close to 30"" of snow on the ground and it's still snowing. Schools have been closed 2 straight days."
526242,splashhopper,2010-12-07 19:28:00,2931, From this morning >>  
526059,mercman,2010-12-07 03:05:00,7054,Holy Crap !!!!!!!!!!! We were sposed to get 1-3 cm. We have at least 15 !! High winds and blowing snow.I cleared the driveway twice and its full again with drifts.Thank god i didnt wait till the last minute to change my tires. I hate winter in the burbs
526061,splashhopper,2010-12-07 03:07:00,2931,"ummm,,, yeah,, we have had close to 80 cm since noon yesterday here in London.  Weather is forecast for 30-40 more tonight and another 30-40 tomorrow!"
526064,mercman,2010-12-07 03:13:00,7054," Don't i feel silly now.15 is like a drop in the bucket i guess. I'll get the St Bernard out,just keep your head above the drifts Ron."
526068,splashhopper,2010-12-07 03:19:00,2931, not too much further to go and the drifts are over my head in our parking lot... and they have NOT plowed it yet!  cars stuck in it everywhere tonight.
526069,skeeter,2010-12-07 03:20:00,1907,we got snow here in scarborough time to go give the sled a hug!!!!!  
526070,irishfield,2010-12-07 03:21:00,26272,"Yah Dan... I think I'll go embrace mine tomorrow as well, before I head for Toronto again.."
526074,icefisherman,2010-12-07 03:26:00,952,"Snow? What snow? Are you guys talking about couple years ago? Haven't seen much of the white stuff for years on the west side of the GTA...not a trace right now.... So may have to come visit you for a picture...with the snow that is  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
526075,mercman,2010-12-07 03:27:00,7054, make sure your lips dont stick to the exhaust pipe.......... rackin frackin snow lovers
526086,Dutchy,2010-12-07 04:30:00,416," That won't save him. I am surprised Ron could even get out the front door of his house. They closed Western today it is so bad, cancelled all classes and exams.  I have been calling my family in Scotland a bunch of whiners because of the unusual artic weather they have been getting. This is what you call Karma:   And its still snowing..........  I wanted to go fishing again on thursday, but not looking likely."
526089,douG,2010-12-07 04:43:00,2693,"Massive amounts of snow for London and Kitchener, brutal.  This northerly flow rivals the westerlies that hammered Buffalo last week.  GB and Lake Huron are still in the high single digits and these cold winds over warm water mean lots of shovel action downwind.  South of Pearson airport, we got an inch over the last 24 hours.  No call for the army yet.  The bananas are still doing fine."
526093,Twocoda,2010-12-07 05:37:00,4130,"it started snowing here last thursday and it hasnt let up as of yet... the lake is ferocious with the winds and ""white wall"" a quarter of a mile off land....this snow came in hard and fast...  Bring on the last saturday of April for more then the obvious reasons"
526100,Spiel,2010-12-07 10:05:00,9065,"Hmmmmm, still not a flake to be seen here in Hamitlon."
526102,solopaddler,2010-12-07 10:52:00,8605, Actually bud it hasn't stopped snowing here at the airport in over 24 hours.  It's so light though you have to go outside and put your hand up against a streetlight to see it.  Just a trace so far. The rest of you guys can keep it.
526103,highdrifter,2010-12-07 10:54:00,2534,OOOHH WEEEE Stop the presses..  C'mon eh?!?!  Seriously..
526105,Spiel,2010-12-07 10:58:00,9065,  Sounds more like frozen fog.....
526110,mercman,2010-12-07 12:00:00,7054,gonna be a fun drive to work today.thanks to AWD we should make it  boat looks lonely in the yard.Maybe i'll go caress it a bit before work
526111,lew,2010-12-07 12:13:00,12766,"With the exception of 3-4"" we got last week here in the Kawarthas, we've totally dodged the bullet so far this winter.  The snowblower is sitting in the garage collecting cobwebs but I can't imagine that'll last too much longer."
526117,JohnF,2010-12-07 13:01:00,3494, Odd. Here in Stratford right between London and Kitchener we've had only a hint of snow in the aril. The grass is still showing thru.  JF
526119,Roy,2010-12-07 13:16:00,13728,I powered up Bertha this morning and cleaned the driveway. Driveways are so much larger without snow eh? Everyone in the neighbourhood has a snow removal service. I'm the only poor dood who does his own. Kinda nice being self sufficient though cause the snow removal services are jammed and lots of driveways are still socked in.
526121,jediangler,2010-12-07 13:21:00,1923,"We got a dusting last night here in Kitchener, just enough accumulation to cover the grass."
526142,mercman,2010-12-07 14:05:00,7054,"  i hear ya Roy  I tanked up the BEAST and did mine twice last nite and had to do it again this morning.Neighbors have a contractor and they hadn't passed at all since the snow started.I'd be pissed !!! But ya have to admit, it really feels like Christmas now."
526150,OhioFisherman,2010-12-07 14:21:00,6623,"Schools are closed here, 8-10 inches of snow on the ground and 3-5 more expected. Got to love them Canadian cold fronts and lake effect snow."
526152,mercman,2010-12-07 14:23:00,7054,  Sorry Dude.  The cold sometimes gets away on us.We're trying to gather it all back up and put it back up north
526166,pikehunter,2010-12-07 15:07:00,1659," Did you all notice what Spiel said? Did ya, now did ya? Ha did ya? See the Hammer really is a beautiful place! And you all thought we were nuts to be here! HA! Na na na na na naaaa.....  But wait, we will get ours yet and when we get it look out! It's only a matter of time till the winds change to the east and wammo! "
526173,stubbex1,2010-12-07 15:32:00,164,"AHHHHHHH!!!!! I got to work at 7 am, the roads were clear and it wasnt snowing.   I cleaned all the cars in the lot, moved them, cleared all the snow, parked all the cars, just got in and made a pot of coffee and its snowing again!!!!!!"
