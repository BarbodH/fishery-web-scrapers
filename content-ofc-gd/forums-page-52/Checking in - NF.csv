I've been reading through some of the threads but no time to pitch in so here's my Cole's notes version!! 1) Nylander is playing like a bag of pudding. Rip that jersey off him and give it to a Marlie. 	2) If the concussion isn't giving Sparks a headache, Hutchinson is. Good on him! Clutchison for the win!! 	3) Chris, your brother's speck was freaking gorgeous. You two look alike...you could have said it was yours! lol 	4) That spruced up old ranger is a beauty! I am partial to old ranger though.... ;)  	5) Good luck to all the ice fisherman in the group this season! Stay safe!!! 	6) Happy New Year folks! Dave"
1038893,aplumma,2019-01-08 21:20:00,6896,Thanks for checking in I hope the new job slows down enough to let you play soon. Be well Art
1038897,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-08 22:26:00,8243,Working for a living is highly over rated. Good luck on the new career.
1038906,chris.brock,2019-01-09 04:47:00,4053,"Yeah, what the hell? are you the new Ottawa Senators public relations executive? do you find any time to sleep? ?"
1038907,AKRISONER,2019-01-09 06:26:00,5558,"Hopefully being busy now just means you have more time during the real season, softwater season lol"
1038992,grimsbylander,2019-01-10 13:40:00,3016,LOL! I'm busy...not suicidal! haha Couldn't imagine dealing with that mess.
1038993,grimsbylander,2019-01-10 13:41:00,3016,That's my goal! Kill it now when the boats under a tarp and hopefully enjoy more of the upcoming summer...er...real season! lol
1039031,dave524,2019-01-10 20:49:00,4508,"Good luck with the new job, obviously it has nothing to do with snow removal ?."
1039035,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-10 21:01:00,8243,"I'm so busy I don't even have time to spend more than 3 hours on OFC at a time. I don't know what I would do without it. Oh, I know, do something on my list of to do's or go to iboats.com or The Bleacher Report site.  I'm doing a load of laundry as I type, reading threads here, watching the TSN rerun of the outdoor NHL game plus listening to WGR radio 1 Bills Drive/Buffalo, talk about multi tasking, man I'm good. Plus pushing the button on a washing machine can be tough work I tell ya'. Gotta go, Judge Judy's on."
1039039,misfish,2019-01-10 21:45:00,29133,So you got this job so you wouldn't have to go ice fishing ? Is that what yer saying ? You sound like that Lew guy. LOL 
1039047,lew,2019-01-10 22:58:00,12766,I heard that !!! ?
1039072,limeyangler,2019-01-11 14:49:00,5204,Happy New year to you too!
1039145,grimsbylander,2019-01-12 05:54:00,3016,Nope!! I'd even rather stand on a frozen lake than work! lol But we do what we have to do.
