1038527,captpierre,2018-12-31 03:56:00,2521,??? I’d like to experience that kind of cold.... for a day!
1038533,Fisherman,2018-12-31 14:55:00,7201,"Ever pee icicles, then you have experienced it."
1038967,scuro2,2019-01-10 00:53:00,904,I've been watching YN weather forecasts...at first I thought it was in Fahrenheit until I saw the minus sign
1038974,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-10 01:31:00,10439,Was chilly this morning. 
1038977,Old Man,2019-01-10 02:22:00,822,"You don’t have to go that far to experience this. Come west to NW Ont, Manitoba or Saskatchewan in winter. "
1039034,jimmer,2019-01-10 20:58:00,2730,I experienced -40+ on Nipissing once and never want to experience it again. All the outfitters machines broke down.
1039038,Jds63,2019-01-10 21:20:00,1365,Dave  ... you must have safe ice ...... LOL
1039044,misfish,2019-01-10 22:35:00,29133,-19 with a wind chill of -28 today. I am good with that thank you very much. LOL
1039291,David Chong,2019-01-15 19:07:00,836,Betcha they're making ice up there! LOL
1039299,misfish,2019-01-15 22:18:00,29133,We got a cold weekend coming.
1039303,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-15 23:29:00,10439,You're welcome.  ?
1039307,misfish,2019-01-16 00:05:00,29133,Thank you
1039352,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-16 18:26:00,10439,Another beaut today.  ? 
1039353,misfish,2019-01-16 19:01:00,29133,Just heard that the ice got blown out from the 6th of Oro all the way past the 9th of Oro. Anglers rescued. The wind here today is howling.
1039355,AKRISONER,2019-01-16 20:01:00,5558,"coldest i ever experienced was in Flin Flon January 12th 1996. It was -39 with 40kmh winds...it was actually too dangerous for us to catch the bus to school, so they cancelled buses on a day with no snow. for me a kid it seemed not far from any other day, -30 hurts and that was normal, so -39 doesnt hurt a lot more lol. however my mom went and swept of the porch to get rid of some blowing snow for about a minute and ended up permanently damaging her ears with frostbite. We do get the odd day in Ontario, this past weekend it was 25 below in pointe au baril...had the classic nose freezing feeling, -30's though is when yours eyes stick when you blink."
1039359,Jds63,2019-01-16 20:20:00,1365,Hey Dave we are not that far off .. LOL..  forecast for Haliburton  
1039360,Fisherman,2019-01-16 20:33:00,7201,"Worst I ever experienced was living in tents in Wainwright, AB in Jan '81, -52 with windchill.  Had a tire on my jeep trailer break, a piece actually broke off, you could see inside but the tire wouldn't flatten it was so cold.  Naphtha would barely light, had 2 tanks for the coleman stove, at 1 hr 55 mins for 2 minutes you'd put the next full tank on the stove to warm it up.  you talk about peeing icicles.  Anything with a motor ran 24/7, if it died or you shut it off,  3 hail marys to get it to start again."
1039379,AKRISONER,2019-01-17 06:15:00,5558,"Lol that’s the classic, these southern  ontarioans don’t know about driving on square tires lol thats when you knew it was cold the tires went thump thump thump as you drove lol sleds and anything else that you wanted to run had to stay somewhere warm. When the weather broke and it got above -25 below again, everyone was out fishing because nothing ran when it was too cold. My stupid brother nearly died one night, him and a friend decided to go ice fishing, sure enough when they went to start the sled, it was a no go. Just too damn cold. They had an ice shack to stay in but ended up breaking into another shack to get fire wood to survive the night. Said it was the coldest longest night of his life sitting in that shack waiting until the temps rose enough the following day to get the sled running again."
1039424,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-17 23:08:00,10439,Yesterday and today were square tire days here.
