Actually, it has become apparent to me that he has been watching me very closely over the years doing my editing, as he knew exactly what do with the editing software with almost no instruction. He told his schoolmates I had a Youtube channel and that he was in a lot of the videos, but because of the weird spelling of my Youtube channel's name, his friends at school struggled to find it when they looked for it, Jack told me that some of the kid's called him a liar. So Jack is even more pumped that he has his own Youtube channel to show off now too, we are still working on the layout together. One of the coolest things was we got into a discussion about how the editing process can change reality and manipulate emotions, he is one thoughtful kid, very proud of him. Anyway, here is Jack doing his thang, hope he sticks with it, i'll do my best to encourage it.   "
