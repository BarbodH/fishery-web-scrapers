1039478,captpierre,2019-01-19 14:36:00,2521,Just watching Charlie Wray. He wasn’t talking about it like he usual dose but I noticed he’s wearing an inflatable belt as a life preserver Never seen that before.  Checked them on line. Different types. Anybody have anything  to say about them?  They look more comfortable to wear.
1039479,dave524,2019-01-19 14:53:00,4508,Is it approved as a PFD or do you have to have a real approved PFD on board besides the belt? I can't see a belt keeping your head above water if you are unconscious.
1039486,kickingfrog,2019-01-19 17:24:00,8333,"It is a pfd (personal floatation device), not a life jacket/vest. For most of us on inland waters a pfd is all that is required. Like other style inflatables it only qualifies if you are wearing it. The moment you take it off you'd better have a standard style on hand.  The belt style has been around for a long time but maybe not as popular, or less noticeable??? Where I see them the most is the stand-up paddle boarders… but many of the ones doing yoga on the SUP take them off. lol"

The belt is just a means of recovery. I'm guilty of never wearing a lifejacket, or PFD. Our christmas presents this year to each other were auto inflate vests. You won't see me with out it on ever again.  S."
