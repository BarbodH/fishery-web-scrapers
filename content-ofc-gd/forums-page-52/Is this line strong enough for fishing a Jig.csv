1039580,Justin C,2019-01-23 01:32:00,30,Well thanks Colin519 I have till spring to think about it. Thanks
1039249,misfish,2019-01-14 21:55:00,29133,"  Didnt I say this ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ all ? LOL LMAO David knows I am joking around. Hope ya all do too. LOL Flipping for buckets, I will tie direct in stained water and heavy cover. "
1039268,Justin C,2019-01-15 13:55:00,30,Wow thanks so much guys this was a great help. It seems i should go with braid. But i have a couple questions about it. The problem is with me is i am a beginner in baitcasting therefore i still get a few backlashes so the problem is i don't want to pay a lot of $$$ for braid and then i have a bad backlash and loose half my spool. The other thing is that i don't have more than two rods I have a medium spinning rod and this one were talking about. So therefore i don't want to put a line on my baitcaster that is only going to be good for only a couple baits. I want a kind of line and a pound test of line that is going to be good for the most kinds of baits. So I would very much appreciate it if you guys here could tell me what baits could go on braided line and at what pound test. Thanks so much for all you guys help.
1039272,Lape0019,2019-01-15 15:54:00,647,"If you really want cheap line to learn with, go buy a 1000 yard spool of Berkley big game at Canadian tire in like 15lb test and start there. It should cost you no more than $14.00. I use this line for crankbaits and spinnerbaits. Now, if you want braid, I will say I do still get backlashes and 9 times out of 10, I can pull them out. Some will take a bit longer than others but when you get a backlash with mono, you weaken the line with a kink. With braid, you done really get the kink and I do not find it weakens the line as much.  Better question for you. What baits are you trying to throw with this rod with the black max on it? I use braid for quite a few of my rods. for bait casting, I have 40lb up to 65lb and use it for jerkbaits, spooks, frogs, jigs, chatterbiats and texas rigs quite a bit. But aside from jerkbaits and spooks, the rest of these all have dedicated rods which all act differently in order to work well with braid. Like, I wouldn't try to throw a frog on the rod I throw a jerkbait on because it just wouldn't work very well. 50lb is an all around good general purpose rod. I use 40lb for the chatterbaits and jerkbaits myself though but may just buy a bulk spool in 50lb sooner or later and just use that."
1039275,Justin C,2019-01-15 16:57:00,30,"This is just a bit confusing for me. So the baits i would like the throw on here would be a Jig, Texas rigs, Spinnerbaits maybe a Chatterbait. And i would love to possibly be able to throw a frog. I don't know if 50 pound braid is going to cover most of those options or is there a different pound test that might cover it better. I know that not one line or one rod is going to cover ever bait there is, but since i only have two rods i want to get the best setup that is going to be able to fish the most options. The other thing is i am not fishing heavy cover i am just fishing some weeds some lay downs im not going to be fishing a ton of heavy cover. Not saying i wont be in the future its just that the area that i fish in don't have a lot of those structures. Thanks"
1039279,David Chong,2019-01-15 17:16:00,836,"Now you know why bass anglers have so many combos. The 50 lbs. braid will be great for your jig & Texas rigs. But if you're throwing a spinnerbait, Chatterbait or crankbait then fluorocarbon would be a better choice. Value-wise the Daiwa J Braid is your best bet. But everybody gets backlashes, although the tournament guys like to call their's ""Professional Overruns!"" LOL Your best course of action would be to get someone who is proficient with a baitcaster to set up your reel with you. I'm aware that you already have your reel but in the future, spending a little more money on a reel like the Daiwa Tatula SV TW is well worth it. Once set up properly it is almost impossible to birdsnest! Good luck! If you happen to be coming down to the Toronto Boat Show next week and feel like lugging your combo down, I would gladly go over the setup for you! I'll be at the Skeeter/Yamaha booth all week long!"
1039282,Justin C,2019-01-15 17:35:00,30,"Thanks so much David. Sadly though i live in Ottawa and that is a long way to Toronto but thanks so much. I am positive i got my reel tuned up right it is just a matter of which baits i want to fish and that will tell me the line i have to go with. Can i fish a frog on a medium/ heavy fast action rod with 50 lb braid, it would not be in extreme cover. Also what would be the reason that i cant fish the spinnerbaits or chatterbaits on the braid, or is it the rod setup. Im not sure. Thanks"
1039283,David Chong,2019-01-15 17:54:00,836,"Yes, a frog on the 50 lbs. braid would be great! It’s never that you can’t fish a particular bait on a particular setup, it’s what is the best setup to fish this bait most efficiently and gives you the highest percentage of Hook-ups plus landing fish! I will be at the Ottawa Boat Show presenting seminars as well, so feel free to come down and see me there!"
1039284,Justin C,2019-01-15 18:05:00,30,Ok Thanks Um one question David so would I be able to fish the spinnerbaits or the chatterbait at all and get them to work ok. Like you said its not the best option but would it work. What is the date that you would be at the ottawa boat show. Thanks
1039285,OhioFisherman,2019-01-15 18:10:00,6623,"Justin, I will certainly agree with David on that, if you are young, new to fishing, whatever, it can be an information overload, and everyone has their own opinions on what is best."
1039288,Justin C,2019-01-15 18:37:00,30,Thanks OhioFisherman I have a question if you had only one baitcasting combo like me and it was a 7 foot medium heavy fast action like mine what baits would you fish on it. And what kind of line and what pound test would you have on it. Remember only one combo. Thanks
1039289,David Chong,2019-01-15 18:43:00,836,"I will be there on Thurs. Feb. 21st presenting at 3 PM, Fri. Feb. 22nd presenting at 1 PM & Sat. Feb. 23rd presenting at 11:30 AM!"
1039290,Justin C,2019-01-15 18:48:00,30,Thanks David
1039292,Justin C,2019-01-15 19:12:00,30,Out of the blue here now I know you guys are saying to use 50 lb braid but what if I said I was going to put 15 pound flourocarbon on the reel. Not sure if you know tactical bass and there website says that I can use these baits with the line below. Please tell me what you think if I put 15 pound flourocarbon on. CRAINKBAITS: 10-17 POUND FLOUROCARBON TEXAS RIGS AND JIGS: 15-25 POUND FLOUROCARBON SWIMJIGS ANS CHATTERBAITS ANS SPINNERBAITS: 15-25 POUND FLOUROCARBON What do you think of those line tests. With FLOUROCARBON I would be able to cover most of my baseswith it. I have heard though that FLOUROCARBON line has a lot of memory to it and is fusturatjng. What do you think about having 15 or 17 pound test FLOUROCARBON as a main line on my baitcaster. Thanks
1039293,Lape0019,2019-01-15 19:41:00,647,"Justin, As you mentioned you are in Ottawa, I would suggest you head down to Paddletales in Winchester if you have never been there. He actually sells the reel Dave recommended and if you buy there, he will 1, spool it with whatever line you want and 2, take you into the parking lot and show you how to set it up. I actually head to Paddletales almost every Thursday night around 6:30 and leave around 9:00 He has a weekly meeting that anyone can attend. Most of us just go to talk fishing with like minded people but if there are ever any questions you want answers too, I guarantee you will get them there. If you are not casting near heavy cover, 50lb braid on your setup will work for frogs. You might run into a little issue of the cover starts getting a little thicker with a medium heavy rod but like stated, that comes down to personal preference. Why you would not want to use braid for spinnerbaits and chatterbaits is 1, personal preference and 2, lack of stretch. These are moving baits so when a fish hits them, you may want some stretch to absorb the shock before the rod completely loads. As stated, I use mono for spinnerbaits, but I use braid for chatterbaits as I fish them around grass a lot and like to be able to pop them out easily should they get hung up. hence, personal preference. Now... back to your fluorocarbon. The only reason I am recommending braid right now is that fluorocarbon is expensive and when you get a birdsnest, you are pretty much guaranteed to kink it and cause damage to the line. Heat also weakens it and tying a not improperly is enough to heat up and weaken the line. Using a bunch of spit or water before cinching down on the knot will alleviate the issue but it takes time get used to it. I am aware of Tactical Bassin and I honestly do not see any issues with what they are recommending above. I typically throw cranks on 12lb. Never used flouro with success for anything else other than drop shot leader material. Now frogs on flouro is a little different because flouro sinks where braid floats so it makes it easier to work the bait.  Hope this information helps you out.  Adam"
1039294,Justin C,2019-01-15 20:04:00,30,"WOW thanks. I used to live in Winchester and I used to pass by that store alot. I was not into fishing at the time. Hmmmm that's alot of info um from what you are saying I will stay away from flourocarbon, just thought I would see if that might be a good option. Well ok I am 100 % that I am going to get braided fishing line. Now I know that I have asked this in another post but is 50 pound braid the best for the lures that I am throwing I am not fishing heavy cover but to fish a frog I know that I should probably have no less than 50 pound.someone here also said that 40pound or less braid will dig into its self. But I am still not sure about test please help. Thanks"
1039296,OhioFisherman,2019-01-15 21:01:00,6623,"If I only had 1? like yours? old school here, 14 pound test Stren original. It may not be a perfect choice for some people, but it is enough to handle most circumstances. I usually went with 10# on a spinning reel unless I was using it in wide open waters like Lake Erie where weeds and wood weren't an issue, then I would have one spooled with 8#, even had one spooled with 8# berkley vanish for clear water, but really didn't notice a difference in the amount of bites. Some of this stuff can leave you guessing, no hits? no fish? or do they just want something other than what you are throwing? LOL.  and even KVD has bad days?"
1039310,Lape0019,2019-01-16 00:29:00,647,"If you’re looking for one size line 40-50lb braid will suit your needs well. Now, I’m not saying fluorocarbon won’t suit your needs sooner or later. I’m saying you do not want to learn how to use a baitcaster with it. Or like I wrote earlier, get a 1000 yard spool of mono and learn with that. Either way, it will be a cheaper way when you do get those birdsnests."
1039313,Justin C,2019-01-16 01:14:00,30,Ok Thanks this has helped me a ton. Thanks guys
1039325,OhioFisherman,2019-01-16 05:06:00,6623,"Justin, I follow tactical bassin, those guys are good, but keep in mind that money doesn't seem to be much of an issue for them, and bass the size that they stand to catch on a daily basis are few and very far between here. The last 10# bass I remember hearing about in my area was like 40 years ago, and some lady caught it in a pay to fish place pond."
1039337,BillM,2019-01-16 15:40:00,17367,"Don't over think it too much.    I'd run braid then change up your leader when conditions call for it.   No way I'd run a flouro mainline, the stuff is just awful."
1039363,Justin C,2019-01-16 22:14:00,30,Thanks everyone this has helped me a ton.
1039369,David Chong,2019-01-17 00:29:00,836,Paddletales is the best bass tackle store in eastern Ontario! Ed is awesome and knows his stuff!
1039370,David Chong,2019-01-17 00:32:00,836,Exactly you’re way overthinking this! Braid is your best bet for overall use! You can always add a flouro leader! Get used to the first combo then add another!
1039374,Justin C,2019-01-17 00:59:00,30,Thanks David
1039576,colin519,2019-01-22 19:36:00,101,"Here's what I would advise: get 14 dollars worth of 20lb big game from Canadian Tire until you know how to cast with reasonable confidence. While you are there pick up a spinning rod with 6-8 lb mono/florocarbon on it and a $10 pack of Berkely Trilene XL or XT depending on what you wanna fish. Learn to use both and spool your own spool. There's nothing you can catch in Ontario you can't catch on 20lb test (or smaller) with a leader if you have good working knowledge of your drag, rod and reel. Get into 50 lb braid and fancy line after you know how to fish with your rod of choice and regular old fishing line that you can get everywhere cheap.  One day you'll be fishing and you'll think 'this Berkeley line casts well but i think i could use something stronger/with better strike detection/less stretchy/easier to tie knots with' and then you'll be able to go out and choose line that work the way you fish and not how someone else fishes. Just my 2 cents and these guys could very well save you years of messing with cheap line  I'm a 6 lb test walleye and small mouth guy or I run 4lb on an ultralight."
1039104,Justin C,2019-01-11 19:56:00,30,Hello everyone Hope everyone is having a great day. I was wondering if someone could help me with something.  I was wondering if 15 pound Fluorocarbon line is strong enough to fish a jig. This is my setup so far. I have a 7' Medium /Heavy  fast action baitcaster with a 6:4:1 gear ratio. I would be fishing it in not a ton of cover but some. I know a lot of guys have braid as there main line and tie on a fluorocarbon leader to that but braid is out of my budget. I just want Strait Fluorocarbon line. If its not strong enough would 30 pound braid be strong enough. Thanks Guys 
1039109,misfish,2019-01-11 21:41:00,29133,"If you can afford floro to fill your spool, you can afford Braid IMO. What are you jigging for ?"
1039112,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-11 21:56:00,8243,"Depends on what you are fishing for like misfish said. I would never use 100% flouro. Why would you? Unless you are longline trolling only the length you have in the water or casting is leaving the spool anyway. You can tie 100' of flouro to whatever you use as backing, like braid or even mono, you only need a few feet of flouro, not a spool full. I actually don't like flouro as a main line. One kink, and they kink, and the line is visible and that's why one uses flouro, invisibility. ."
1039116,Justin C,2019-01-11 22:31:00,30,Ok thanks I priced out Braid vs fluorocarbon and fluoro was cheaper but yes braid would be a nice option. I am throwing a jig for largemouth. So what do you think is 30 pound braid strong enough to fish a jig.  Thanks
1039118,sauce,2019-01-11 22:38:00,219,"Yes. 15 pound flouro would work just fine. Then comes the day that you are fishing heavy cover and you are busting off jigs. That's when you will wish you had spooled up with some heavy braid. To me, 15 pound flouro on the setup you described is good for fishing jerk baits in clear water near cover."
1039119,misfish,2019-01-11 22:39:00,29133,"The price of braid between 30-50 is nothing IMO. I would go with 50. When you set the hook, you wont be burying the line in the spool. This is just my experience."
1039129,Justin C,2019-01-12 01:00:00,30,Good Point misfish but the reel that i have does not cast 40 pound braid and up very well at least that is what everyone says about the reel it even says on the tag that came with the reel that the braid capacity is 30 pounds 180 yds. So I don't want to go over that.  Thanks 
1039130,OhioFisherman,2019-01-12 01:06:00,6623,"I threw a lot of jigs using 17-20 lb test mono and never had a problem with them breaking off, even thru them on lighter line. If you are in one of our southern states where there are bass that exceed 6 pounds on a regular basis lighter line is more of an issue. Also cover, around wood. like docks, fallen trees light line can be a problem, it's nice to be able to exert enough force on them to help prevent them from getting into deeper cover once hooked."
1039131,Justin C,2019-01-12 01:23:00,30,Thanks OhioFisherman Did you find that mono had to much stretch in the line when setting the hook.
1039133,OhioFisherman,2019-01-12 01:57:00,6623,"Justin, I am a geezer and for most of my life my fishing line was original Stren mono, no the stretch wasn't an issue, and actually it may help in case you get carried away with a hookset, it acts like a shock absorb-er. Our water isn't quite as clear in most lakes here as compared to Canadian lakes, but I also saw no need for straight floro unless it was a really tough bite, and even then I can't say it helped. A fish probably isn't real smart, you need floro but can catch them on an a rig with wires and swivels and stuff all over it? If you are fishing for big fish, like muskies and big pike? I can see a purpose for braid, it's nice to have 65-80 pound test line that doesn't feel like anchor rope? People were using mono and catching fish on it for a long time, but now marketing has brought us newer, more expensive options?"
1039135,Garfisher,2019-01-12 02:08:00,229,"I use 17lb Trilene 100% fluoro without much problem using jigs and chatterbaits. That being said, definitely check your line especially if you've jacked a couple bass (really hard sets), as you may be a backlash or really hard set away from busting off. I do like the combo for dragging tubes if you have the opportunity to do that in the fall, the line does last a bit in the mussels but of course constantly check your line as it will get nicked-up pretty good"
1039139,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-12 04:00:00,8243,Most of 180 yards of line never see the light of day when fishing the way you describe.
1039140,chris.brock,2019-01-12 04:18:00,4053,What bait caster reel do you have Justin C?
1039146,Justin C,2019-01-12 13:48:00,30,Thanks Guys I have a Cheap starter reel it is a Abu Garcia Black Max 3 6:4:1 Gear Ratio. The setup has worked very well so far though. Thanks 
1039147,bobowski,2019-01-12 13:56:00,360,I would recommend using braid with a fluoro leader. Fluoro has a lot of memory and is pretty stiff. Braid is so much more durable IMO.
1039149,Justin C,2019-01-12 14:01:00,30,Hmm thanks i will have to think about it. But has anyone just put strait Flouro on a baitcaster as the main line. That would be ideal. Thanks 
1039154,OhioFisherman,2019-01-12 16:14:00,6623,
1039155,boombap,2019-01-12 17:39:00,310,"I've tried about 5-6 different flouro lines on different baitcasters.. can never get the hang of it. 30-50# braid on all my setups now, spent too much money to be dissapointed with flouro. Sometimes I'll throw on a 2ft flouro leader. Fishing any heavy cover 100% braid."
1039161,Reelpro,2019-01-12 19:10:00,73,"Check out Suffix Invisiline Castable Flourocarbon  14-17 lb I use a lighter weight for walleye jigging with a spinning rod, super strong stuff and has a little more flexibility than a leader grade floro The line has very little stretch - between mono and braid - and it also sinks which i like for deeper jigging and feel to the jig. 7Lb Invisiline on spinning gear landed these 2 plus hundreds more without bite offs or line breaking  "
1039206,kickingfrog,2019-01-13 23:22:00,8333,"Braid might cost more up front but is cheaper in the end. Under all the conditions I fish, braid lasts longer. When it gets too worn I reverse it and get a few more seasons out of it."
1039207,BillM,2019-01-14 00:02:00,17367,"Yup, braid for me on basically everything but the downrigger rods and my UL resident trout setup."
1039212,David Chong,2019-01-14 01:16:00,836,"Hey Justin, If you are throwing a flipping jig for Largemouth, then I would go with 50 lbs. test braid (Regardless of what the reel says and you don't need 180 yds. of line to flip for Largemouth) for most water clarity. But if you're dealing with ultra clear water and want to use straight fluorocarbon, then my suggestion would be 20 lbs. test fluorocarbon. These are the 2 best options for throwing/flipping a jig for Buckets as far as I'm concerned. The price difference shouldn't matter because the braid will last longer anyway, where you're using it is by far a more important determining factor. Good luck!"
1039225,msp,2019-01-14 14:15:00,1336,I agree wit Dave Chong. Go with 50 pound braid and a flouro leader if you feel you need it. Your reel should handle 50
1039233,OhioFisherman,2019-01-14 17:02:00,6623,"Justin, this reel? http://www.abugarcia.com/abugarcia-reels-baitcast-reels-low-profile/abu-garcia-black-max-low-profile/1373565.html "" Braid Capacity yd/lb "
1039234,Lape0019,2019-01-14 17:14:00,647,"Hey Justin, Dave is right. but really, we already all know that. He is probably one of the most recognized fisherman on this page because of his tournament winnings as well as all of the seminars he does. So let us start off with your reel. You have a black max that says 30LB - 180yrds. That is a guideline to show you how much line you will have on the spool with 30lbs braid. that is it. And to say it doesn't cast 50lb braid very well is hard to believe because 50lb braid has the diameter of 12-13lb test mono which is close to the same diameter as flouro. Also, flouro needs replacing a whole lot more often then braid. I'll go usually 2 seasons without replacing my braid but I am lucky to get half a season with flouro if I am running it as a mainline. And the flouro I use costs more than braid so no matter how you look at it, it will be cheaper in the long run. I have run 30ln braid on my baitcasters before and when you set the hook, it will dig in and create issues. For this reason, I try and stay with 40lb or higher. In your case, I would run 50lb braid and not even bother with a leader if you are that worried about having multiple lines. Flouro leaders help but my experience says you will catch fish either way.  Hope this helps.  Adam"
