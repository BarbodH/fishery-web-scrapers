1038889,BillM,2019-01-08 19:59:00,17367,Man that looks awful.   It's going to be a few weeks yet I guess.
1038890,Terry,2019-01-08 20:11:00,14456,Yeah two three days it should be cherry lol thanks for he report

1038917,limeyangler,2019-01-09 13:41:00,5204,"You guys are brave. I get many comments when I post reports in November about being careful. Here the same rule applies...""no ice is safe ice"" ....but the freeze up is somewhat predictable when your weather is minus stoopid℃ every day, and the resulting ice clear and black. All that broken ice and constantly changing temps into the + and back to -  with snow and rain thrown into the mix and some of the pictures I see of the ice down there would probably see me never going out! BE CAREFULL OUT THERE!"
1038919,SirCranksalot,2019-01-09 13:57:00,3291,too much ice for the toon???
1038929,Fisherman,2019-01-09 16:23:00,7201,Put a sail on it and you'll be in Beavertown in 10 minutes.
1038952,misfish,2019-01-09 22:10:00,29133,"Seems the wind is helping keep most of the snow we got today ( 4""+ ) off, but there are drifts all around, with patches of ice showing. Not what we needed. Those drifts are going to be land mines. The ice is being insulated under those drifts. No matter how cold it gets,it aint making under those drifts."
