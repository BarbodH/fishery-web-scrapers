1034944,Hank Jr,2018-10-09 11:22:00,146,"Just got back from a week of Muskie fishing on Balsam , Sturgeon and Pigeon with my son . The weather was not the best except Wednesday lots of rain and wind one day on Balsam the wind hit 17 mph some big white caps . Ended the week with 9 Muskies in the boat and saw or had hits or hooked fish 26 other times . Biggest for the week was 44"" best lures were spinners and bulldogs . We did have 7 follows from fish 40"" or bigger . The last 2 days we had some motor problems a throttle sensor went bad and the Mercury dealer didn't have the part so we couldn't go at slow speeds or idle . Can't wait to come back next year . Here is one of my sons fish from Balsam. "

1034956,OhioFisherman,2018-10-09 16:14:00,6623,"Sounds like a fun week even with the problems, the weather this time of year is always so unpredictable., especially tough to plan from hundreds of miles away."
1034993,Rizzo,2018-10-10 01:18:00,4754,awesome! A week or musky fishing...sounds great. I am limited to a day here a day there...if that day falls on a bad conditions day it is tough!
1035006,Hank Jr,2018-10-10 11:09:00,146,I learned years ago nothing you can do about the weather just grin and bare it . Its just tough you wait all year for your trip and mother nature throws you curve LOL.
1035091,BillM,2018-10-11 14:25:00,17367,Did much better on Balsam then I did on Tuesday!  lol!   Weather always rolls in when I go fishing.
1039122,Cando,2019-01-11 22:57:00,90,Nice fish!!! Balsam can be a scary lake when the winds pick up. What areas do you fish? My dad got a 48 incher many years ago at the opening of south day. There use to be lot around Ant Island as well.My late uncle use to fish for them somewhere near Rosedale from the shore.
