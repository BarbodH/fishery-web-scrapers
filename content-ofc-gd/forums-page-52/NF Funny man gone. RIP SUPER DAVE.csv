1038685,Rizzo,2019-01-03 23:49:00,4754,"Sure hope they are making him a casket with ""genuine Saskatchewan sealskin bindings"""

1038719,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-04 19:15:00,8243,One of my faves. His latest gig was on Larry David. That dry delivery always made me howl. His brother was a great entertainer too. Can't remember his name. He had an episode on the Twilight Zone movie. Will Google later.
1038720,Acountdeleted,2019-01-04 19:42:00,2562,I remember watching the Super Dave show as a kid. Used to love it. Sad to see him go.
1038735,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-04 23:04:00,8243,"His actual name is Bob Einstein. Can't find his brothers name. He played the dead pan dentist on The Larry David Show. We first met Super Dave on a Canadian comedy show in the 80's playing the ill fated stunt man, I don't care what Wikipedia says that's where I first saw him. Reminded me of the Coyote on the Roadrunner cartoon."

1038803,bigugli,2019-01-07 00:48:00,6138,I remember him when he used to be on John Byner'sÂ Bizarre show before he had his own show.
1038814,Rizzo,2019-01-07 12:49:00,4754,"thats what it was...bizarre...for some reason I was thinking I knew his stuff from SCTV. Couldn't go through an episode without him calling someone a Putz or something being strapped to him with those dang ""bindings""....like Saskatchewan has seals"
1038866,dave524,2019-01-08 11:22:00,4508,Think he did a few Letterman's as well in the beginning.
