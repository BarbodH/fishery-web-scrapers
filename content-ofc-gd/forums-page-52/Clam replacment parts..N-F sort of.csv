Recently purchased one used and instead of patching the holes was wondering if anyone knows where to purchase in Canada?  Went to Clam website and I can get one here from the states but they are currently closed (as all Canadian orders have to be processed over the phone) and I expect it might take bit. Any ideas? Willing to drive to get one or of course delivered to the door would be awesome. ….and just to make this a fishing thread I was on Simcoe (inner KB) yesterday and marked a bunch in 45' but no takers. Nothing marked deeper, nothing shallower Thanks all and swing hard!"

1039503,brkygetr,2019-01-20 01:16:00,425,10-4 OF. I did check their site...nothing when you search. They are also closed at the moment.. I will call in the AM for sure. Appreciate the effort for the info though...
1039506,OhioFisherman,2019-01-20 01:42:00,6623,"https://www.kijiji.ca/b-ontario/clam-shelters/k0l9004 Saw this message on the Sail site, ""  The products in this category are not yet available online, but we have them in store! 		Come browse our wide selection in one of our stores. "" LOL, I am guessing most places in my area are closed also since we seem to be surrounded by level 2 and 3 snow emergencies."
1039507,porkpie,2019-01-20 04:47:00,2521,"Your going to have to order a replacement tent from Clam, unless you stumble across someone selling one on Kijiji.  I’ve never seen a retailer carrying replacement tents.  I suppose your local tackle shop could order one in, but at that point you may as well order direct."
1039509,G.mech,2019-01-20 15:25:00,830,I went through the same process and ended up ordering direct.  They do return e-mails but sometimes take quite a while so you're best to just call.  Their customer service is really good but not on this side of the border.
1039515,brkygetr,2019-01-20 21:58:00,425,Was it a fairly good turn around for delivery? Any issues with additional charges at customs? I can make it through this season with the patches I have sewn in but would like to get the Thermal cover anyways...and according to their site the thermal is only $80 more.
1039519,G.mech,2019-01-21 01:06:00,830,"The shipping was about $40US, and taxes/duty was 23%.  It arrived quick, around a week as I recall.  The tent for my Denali was about $225 and the thermal was $250 US last year.  I ordered some poles a couple of years ago too and they came quickly with no issues."
1039529,Sinker,2019-01-21 14:20:00,8692,"A friend of mine just did exactly what you want to do. Got the thermal cover delivered direct from clam, over the phone, to his door in about a week. $250 US. Well worth it. The thermal cover is the only way to go. Its night and day. S."
