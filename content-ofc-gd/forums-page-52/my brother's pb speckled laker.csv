1038807,chris.brock,2019-01-07 03:24:00,4053,"I was busy feeding the younger generation minnows.  6 lines in the water, some moving around too, but the 3 decent fish came from the same hole, my brother's hole. Pretty cool colours on this one.   Lastly came his pb. Take note of the look in his eyes and the smirk on his face. It's almost euphoric, yet evil and sinister. It's hard to tell if he wants to eat it's eye balls or penetrate it in privacy behind some Hemlocks.    My Dad was driving. We marked that magic hole as the third island, standing behind the tree, line up just a tad to the right of the bay, 21 paces out and 6 beers to the left.  All fish released. Let'm go, let'm grow.

1038811,chris.brock,2019-01-07 05:27:00,4053,"Colin's terminal tackle was crap again. I was whining at him for not being properly set up when there's big fish to be had, but he got away with it and landed all his fish. I like the way it played out, Colin was super happy, that makes me happy. Stan was darting around, grabbing any bouncing tip ups he could get to first. I gotta give credit, that's a Chuck recommended lake, Chuck came up a lot in the conversation throughout the day and we all agreed we wish he would have headed north and been there too. "
1038812,Acountdeleted,2019-01-07 12:35:00,2562,Wow. What a beauty. Strange how there is always a 'lucky hole' people can be fishing 2 feet away but there is always one that is hot. Makes no sense to me.
