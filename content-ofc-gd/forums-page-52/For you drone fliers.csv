1038931,Terry,2019-01-09 16:36:00,14456,So I have to remove my phaser canon off my drone.  And I can’t swoop down and pick up mice with it anymore bummer
1038945,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-09 20:32:00,8243,"I can't believe how much the price of a drone has gone down since they came on the market. I was given one for Christmas from my God Daughter. I saw it in the window at The Source for 25 bucks. Not sure what one gets for 25 bucks. Now I need to find a place to fly it. I don't want to practice over the lake, it may be the last time I fly it."
1038990,KawarthaAngler,2019-01-10 13:20:00,273,For $25 ... keep your expectations low.
1039023,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-10 19:28:00,8243,I have none. It's the giving that counts for me. She's 12 years old.
1039029,KawarthaAngler,2019-01-10 20:34:00,273,Well then ... it's pretty priceless then.  :)
1039081,JoePa,2019-01-11 16:32:00,179,I live out in the country and I often see guys in a contraption that looks like a lawn chair with a small motor and a parachute flying over my yard - I often wave to them - they come and go real quickly - I guess I would get pissed off if some drone came over my place and stayed there any length of time looking down at my place - if done more than once it would probably make its last flight   - it won't be long before someone starts selling rockets that can be used to shoot down the drones - they can be very useful though if used in the right way - you can get some beautiful pictures which you couldn't otherwise - Amazon is toying with the idea of delivering packages with the things - there will be drones flying all over the place 
1039090,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-11 17:49:00,10439,I like using my drone around the cabin. Have to be careful though as it is on a flightpath to the hydro dam and several lodges. I don't take it above the legal height and as long as the aircraft stay above their legal height we should be ok.         
1039091,irishfield,2019-01-11 18:03:00,26272,"Legal aircraft height above water is ZERO feet and 500 feet separation from boats / persons / shore unless landing and taking off then it doesn't apply. I know you fly it responsibly Dave, many do not."
1039092,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-11 18:12:00,10439,Yes the 500' over land is what I was referring to. The laws for drones are a maximum of 400' so there should be atleast 100' of separation. At least over land.
1039132,pics,2019-01-12 01:51:00,1268,Simon is right about the privacy issue with drones.. People worry about them but they really should worry about internet security. Amazon echo or Google home in a kids bedroom?? THAT is nuts!!.... If people followed basic rules and common courtesy then we wouldn't need all these laws..
1039134,KawarthaAngler,2019-01-12 02:06:00,273,I completely agree. Laws exist to give direction and morals to those that lack them.

1025667,AKRISONER,2018-04-04 16:40:00,5558,"one of those things, you fly your drone near an airport like an idiot...youll get busted. You fly your drone on your own private property and dont be a nuisance no one will bug you.  You do what my moron neighbors at the cottage did multiple days last summer...flying your drone 300 meters over the forest and hover over our deck for 10 minutes...next time ill bring out the .22"

1025670,G.mech,2018-04-04 17:13:00,830, Keep that up and they're going to make you get a permit to fire a rifle into the air!
1025671,glen,2018-04-04 17:28:00,2641,Next Olympic sport drone shooting. I thought drones were going to be used for pot deliveries.
1025674,John Bacon,2018-04-04 17:59:00,3277,Do you have any other sources that indicate that license and insurance will be required for personal use of a drone?  That is not the way I read it from this site  https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/opssvs/applying-special-flight-operations-certificate.html

1025676,misfish,2018-04-04 19:02:00,29133,"There is a positive to this. Terry wont be able to fly his, which means, one less thing for him to break. OOPS.LOL"
1025819,iFish4real,2018-04-06 20:17:00,386," If that happens, next thing we're gonna have are pirate drones"
1025821,ketchenany,2018-04-06 21:43:00,3229,"Terry is a breaker, not a maker?  yahmabrokeit?"
1025822,Terry,2018-04-06 21:48:00,14456,Hey.   Hey hey hey I sold mine when I first heard all the rules coming down. And it was in one piece.  When sold
1025823,bigugli,2018-04-06 21:52:00,6138,"The drones are a big invasion of privacy, and they are a flight risk near airfields. I've seen a couple, recently, flying in the vicinity of small local airports."
1025831,ketchenany,2018-04-06 22:35:00,3229,"And down it came. One piece here and one there, lol"
1025838,irishfield,2018-04-07 00:15:00,26272,All I can tell you is that Lakeland Airways and I are keeping score on how many we can get each summer with our props or wings! Score is currently tied at one to one!
1025839,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 01:59:00,8243,"I don't like them. They are an invasion of my privacy. A neighbour let their teen grandson and his crew stay at their Lake House last summer. The incessant rheeeeeeee sound was nerve wracking. They were on the beach and running it up and down the shoreline and laneway one afternoon within 50 feet of cottages. The last time I heard it was just before I heard a blast from a 12 gauge. I don't condone shooting a weapon off in a small neighbourhood over the lake where there were no people either but.......Remington 1 , Drone 0 If you have one, great enjoy but do it away from me, far away."
1025840,bigugli,2018-04-07 02:03:00,6138,I worry about the drone traffic at the one airfield as it is a glider training centre for air cadets
1025841,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 02:04:00,8243,I don't want to be the old curmudgeon that won't give a kid his ball back when it goes over the fence but if I see another one flying close by it's 911 time. Bruce I would have called the Leo's if I saw one near an airfield. This entire lake is an airfield actually.
1025848,limeyangler,2018-04-07 10:50:00,5204,"I think it’s odd when I hear people using privacy issues as a reason to bash drones. When I fly my drone I could give a rats butt what people are doing, I’d be more worried about closed circuit monitoring of everything andthe data being exploited by  the social media platforms you use to complain about drone users"
1025850,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 11:27:00,8243,"That's part of the problem. You have to remember there are probably more people in our little beachside residence than all those folks within 50k's of you Simon. As far as CCTV, not 1 within 60 K's of here.  I should have said I don't like them bothering me, go play in the field across the road, nothing to see there though."
1025854,limeyangler,2018-04-07 14:12:00,5204,"I totally get what you are saying and appreciate that I live in the boonies, In fact I moved from the city, with no job or connections to this place to get away from noise, hussle and bustle etc, a bold move which has paid off....I recommend it. My point is more about when people, perhaps not you, but I have encountered many, many people that assume that they are the target of being filmed. People are far too boring to film  and if you go on any drone forum the videos people are posting are of amazing landscape vistas and some architecture. Where people are involved it is usually obvious from the footage that they are willing participants. Of course people are filmed without permission, but to think this is a problem that warrants more and more punitive measures for drone owners ignores the fact that your privacy is being invaded in much more sinister ways nearly every second of the day, whether or not you hear drone propellers. As for noise pollution and people already breaking the strict rules governing drone flights, there will always be those that will. I will abide by any rules that come out until it becomes to costly or prohibitive to actually use my drone, maybe insurance is a good thing anyway, maybe some basic training for operators is a good thing too, however in my opinion from the off the government rules have been kneejerk and punitive in nature and these latest proposals smack of a money grab. "
1025858,Fisherman,2018-04-07 15:12:00,7201,"I think a lot of the problems originate from a high percentage of people buying them without any common sense.  It falls into the same category as super headlights that give off a nuclear glow at night blinding everyone oncoming.  Or lets have blue signal lights, etc.  Noisy mufflers,  tires that stick out a foot beyond the fenders, and we can go on with other items.  If they sell them in a store we can do whatever we want with them.  Some want to use them for hunting and scouting, not cool.  If someone was to use it at the lake during ice fishing simply to check for unseen pressure cracks, fine, but don't be buzzing around annoying people."
1025867,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 16:36:00,8243,"Simon it was obvious to all here that the 6 or so bikini clad young ladies that were sunbathing on the beach and swim raft in the lake were being filmed. If I was 40 years younger I might be the one doing the filming. To tell the truth I don't think they minded being filmed, I didn't see anyone run for cover. Besides all that think of all the Chopper Pilots out of work because of them. When I see a program on Canadian TV that is more than likely filmed with a drone I wonder why they aren't being charged under the current legislation, maybe they are, I doubt it however."
1025879,camillj,2018-04-07 20:22:00,1988,Missus bought me a drone for christmas...which I took back (before the 30 day return policy kicked in ... mostly because I hadn't decided exactly WHICH drone I need for my purposes ... SCOUTING ... not sure what the problem is with scouting is though...  as a prospector who travels the 'untravelled' places .. it'd be nice to send a drone over yonder hill or lake .. before having to cut my way through the crap to get there ... chances are nobody would ever know since i'm normally miles from the next human being or cell tower or plane
1038930,G.mech,2019-01-09 16:29:00,830,New regulations finally to be announced....no more 'Hold my beer while I fly this drone mission' it appears.  Lots of rules that don't really appear too enforcable. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/drones-aviation-garneau-regulations-1.4970750
