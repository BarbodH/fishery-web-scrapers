1038679,Rattletrap2,2019-01-03 22:06:00,1652,I remember those Ranger Fisherman boats from the old days of Babe Winkelman and In-Fisherman. They both used those boats in the late '80's and early 90's. Very nice!
1038700,Fish Farmer,2019-01-04 13:49:00,2234,"Looks great I'm doing the same with my Lund replacing carpet with vinyl, what glue did you use if you don't mind me asking. They say use a water base glue not contact cement."
1038704,AKRISONER,2019-01-04 14:24:00,5558,"The rare glass tiller..very cool  anyone that doesn’t like a glass boat probably has a few screws loose, most likely from being bashed around in a tin can ?"
1038708,tomkat,2019-01-04 15:14:00,246,I used a 3m aerosol for the compartment lids and for the floor it came in a bucket from Home Depot and I used a notched trowel don’t remember the name but it was for outdoor carpet / vinyl . It seemed to adhere well hopefully it lasts. When using the 3m for the lids you need to be very precise with placement as there is no movement after it’s down. I got the vinyl at bass pro across the border as I didn’t see it advertised in the Canadian stores but I was told they do have it here? Think I was around 300 bucks for the vinyl. I had never done it before and I think it was easier to work with than carpet would be.
1038731,Fish Farmer,2019-01-04 22:56:00,2234,"Thanks tomkat, that's what I bought from Home Depot Only problem was after taking the carpet of the doors was the gap from carpet to the vinyl. Had to glue some wood strips to take up the gap on the aluminum doors. This is only one section of the floor, have a few more sections to do, winter project.    "
1038737,tomkat,2019-01-04 23:20:00,246,I also took the hinges off so I could get the vinyl wrapped completely. It was a real pain on the ranger lids I had to drill the rivets out and afterwards I couldn’t reuse the holes so I had to offset the hinges on the boat and lids. I only had 1 flush floor compartment the rest were all on the sides and fit on top.
1038749,Fish Farmer,2019-01-05 00:46:00,2234,"I did drill out the rivets from the frame but not off the doors it self. I set the doors in the frame so you could see the gap. Left the hinge on the lid, there is a space to get the vinyl in between hinge and lid. I have heavy rivets that I'd bought at Princes Auto that will work. What a job trying to get the old glue off the lids I used brake cleaner and carburetor cleaner , what a mess "
1038758,tomkat,2019-01-05 03:23:00,246,Haha! Yup I was getting frustrated with the compartment lids There are 7 of them. But the carpet and glue was basically decomposing so it had to be done. When you are finished it will all be worth it.
1038761,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-05 12:40:00,8243,"Dave, I've done more than a few floors in the last few winters. 3M is the best, beware make sure the material is exactly where you want it. Once on it is a chore to take off within minutes. The trowel notch size is very important based on the instructions of the adhesive, very important. I don't remember exactly which HD adhesive we used. The warmer the adhesive the better it goes on. Make sure the area is well ventilated and use one of those Comfo 2 respirators you may have borrowed from the plant with the proper cartridge, type 2 is all purpose. If not you may think you were in Woodstock. I didn't read the entire thread so I may have said something already pointed out. We got the marine vinyl from a place in Orillia I think, I didn't take the trips. I'll check my iboat.com file to check. That's site is a good one for any boat owner."
1038784,Fish Farmer,2019-01-06 12:39:00,2234,"Thanks Johnny, I've got my vinyl flooring now, I've read about gluing the vinyl and it came up with stuff they say is water base and you have time to move it a little, it doesn't dry right away. Some have used contact cement but you only have one chance after it makes contact."
1038786,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-06 17:30:00,8243,Good luck Dave.  It's the 3M spray I was referring to as not moving once set. The liquid is more forgiving. I was thinking of removing the old 24 year old carpet which is in good shape on the StarCraft and putting down vinyl myself. A checker plate type finish . I have more important things on the list of to do's as well as the $$$.
1038377,tomkat,2018-12-28 02:17:00,246,Upgraded a ranger 680t. Been a fun project really like the boat. Replaced the shot carpet with vinyl and put a new four stroke on it.   
1038381,David Chong,2018-12-28 02:42:00,836,"Great job, looks mint! A Yamaha 4 stroke is awesome as well!"
1038383,tomkat,2018-12-28 02:53:00,246,Haven’t run it with the Yamaha yet. Looking forward to spring!
1038386,David Chong,2018-12-28 02:57:00,836,You'll love it! I put 600 hours over 4 years on one and it never gave me any issues other than having to change an impeller and performing regular maintenance!
1038388,porkpie,2018-12-28 05:36:00,2521,Nice rig!
1038529,bigbuck,2018-12-31 12:33:00,2449,"Vinyl is nice for easy cleaning. The ONLY problem with it is it gets hot in the sun, can't barefoot it in the boat on hot sunny days. Other than that, it makes for the best floor covering for marine purposes IMHO."
1038531,Chris J,2018-12-31 13:10:00,44,Great looking little tiller.  One cool boat.
1038539,BillM,2018-12-31 17:37:00,17367,That looks like a fun rig to fish out of.
1038541,BassMan11,2018-12-31 17:45:00,583,Boat looks great!
1038542,misfish,2018-12-31 18:05:00,29133,That boat will outlast the motor. Real nice work on that vessel.
1038543,BillM,2018-12-31 18:09:00,17367,"That motor won't die, who are you kidding"
1038545,misfish,2018-12-31 19:00:00,29133,"Did say it would die,just out last it.LOL What year is the ranger ? 87,88 ? My old ranger was built like a tank. Not like the ones today.  Just ask Art. He has a tank as well."
1038552,tomkat,2018-12-31 21:00:00,246,The boat is a 1991. The motor is 2018. So I might now have more money into the boat than makes sense! But I will keep it for a long time and it suits me. 17 feet long and 80 inches wide just barely fits in the garage. I had 2 similar sized aluminum boats and I prefer fishing out of this one. It’s a popular boat with musky guys in the states and I saw a few guys fixing them up. Very smooth quiet ride and pretty roomy for a small boat doesn’t get blown around by the wind as much as my last boats.  
1038554,misfish,2018-12-31 22:00:00,29133,"I would take that over any aluminum, any day."
1038566,Rattletrap2,2019-01-01 04:57:00,1652,Beautiful boat and nice work Tomkat!!
1038567,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-01 10:00:00,8243,"Very, very nicely done. She's a beauty and a keeper. Being a keeper it doesn't matter if you went above what fair market value of the girl, are you going to flip it soon? I didn't think so. I can tell you she's going to be a head turner at the ramp this coming season. I'm not a glasser guy but if I was she would be a Ranger. Way to go me man, great job!!! I have to add invest some good money into a quality travel or mooring cover. My personal choice is Sunbrella. It will last years and keep her dry. A big mistake people make is thinking a good vinyl floor will keep the water out of the hull, it eventually won't."
1038574,buick14,2019-01-01 14:20:00,741,That is a beautiful boat man!
1038576,tomkat,2019-01-01 15:00:00,246,Thx for having a Look! Hope everyone has a great 2019!
1038583,John Bacon,2019-01-01 16:51:00,3277,Looks great.  It's hard to believe that boat from 1991 can still look that good.
1038585,tomkat,2019-01-01 17:08:00,246,It’s pretty good But when you look up close it has some wear and tear. I might try and buff it with a 2 stage system. I did it with a single stage and it helped a bit but I think it can polish up better. I saw some before and after pics of similar boats and they clean up pretty good.
1038626,Sinker,2019-01-02 16:36:00,8692,Looks awesome! How many hp in that yammy? What was on it before for HP?  S.
1038640,tomkat,2019-01-02 23:28:00,246,Yamaha is 50hp the Johnson was a 60. The boat is rated for 65 hp max. I would have rather got a 60hp but the deal on the Yamaha was too good to pass up. Should get around 30 mph give or take.
1038672,msp,2019-01-03 19:24:00,1336,awesome boat ! great motor as well. I have had my 50 yammy 4 stroke for about ten years now. love it !
1038674,Sinker,2019-01-03 20:30:00,8692,Nice! I love tillers. Wouldn't have anything but.
1038676,misfish,2019-01-03 21:19:00,29133,Were you not in a steering bass boat when we met on whitie grounds ? LOL
