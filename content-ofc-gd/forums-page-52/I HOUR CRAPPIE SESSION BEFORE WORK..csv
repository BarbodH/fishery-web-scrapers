1039499,lunkerbasshunter,2019-01-20 00:46:00,2585,I love your videos!  I cant believe a video like this gets only a few replies but non fishing topics get dozens haha anyway thanks for taking the time to post.  I enjoyed it! Oh by the way.  You know your hardcore when you have a briefcase for your ice rods haha Cheers!  
1039504,brkygetr,2019-01-20 01:21:00,425,Hey Simon...as always well done. Wish I was still in that neck of the woods this time of year!

1039521,limeyangler,2019-01-21 03:55:00,5204,"You are most welcome! The topic of why people respond more to off topic posts comes up every now and again, there are lots of legitimate reasons, I don't often comment of fishy posts either, one fish and you seen 'em all.....lol. I don't take offence, I like posting in here regardless, don't get me wrong an acknowledgment is nice, but I know most people appreciate what I post.  LOL@ briefcase! Dude!!!!! Its been so long I forgot your first name, but not our adventures from many moons ago, I still need to redeem myself on that little splice lake off the Atikokan Hwy! No doubt!"
