I have a couple that were made in the USA that are labeled as K-2 and K3 Wrinkle (spoon 2, 3). I also have a couple similar to the one you have (spoon 4, 5). They aren't labelled at all though.  They are both curved, but the image doesn't show it very well. Bass Pro Shops used to make spoons that have similar curvatures as well. No clue on the name, XPS something I am sure.  I couldn't find them.  Far right spoon in the second image.   "

I am guessing the first picture, 3rd from the left is the spoon in the Sunshine Lake report. It likely has some mojo too. Phil said what made these spoons effective and swim seductively was the balance of the spoon weight and the curvature, including the weight of the hook. Swapping out the hook will bugger it up. I don't know??? I'm just glad I can now buy some more, thanks to the help from the other guys posting. "

1024990,Snidley,2018-03-24 21:58:00,620,"Phil, Phil, Phil. The much sought out Wrinkle Spoon (aka MiracleSpoon) has a predicesor. At the Hamilton swap meet I found what I thought were 2 small size Wrinkle Spoons. Low and behold one of them (naturally the oldest looking beat up one) has the lable on the back saying, Flash Bait, made by the Nebco company out of Minnesota.  Further investigation on EBay shows many of these spoons BUT, they are all old and mostly beaters. The ones I purchased were virtually identical except the orange colour is not the same (the Flash Bait's orange is darker, duller and in a less curvey pattern). The old story of nothing's new under the angling sun appears, again, to be true. The swap meet itself was, as always, excellent"
1025708,PUMP KNOWS,2018-04-05 01:19:00,937,Did you guys place an order for the magic lure from Phil?
1025713,chris.brock,2018-04-05 04:00:00,4053,"Sort of, lol. I guess Phil only stamps out a bunch at a time. He won't sell them unless they're complete and packaged. I think he's waiting for something from the US (hooks?). He hasn't said a price yet either. I'm pretty sure I will get them, it's just a slow process. "

The only difference is in the brightness of the orange paint and that may be due to the age of the Flashbaits.  This does not change the fact that the Flashbaits and Krinkles REALLY work. It's also interesting that the Nebco company, the firm  that made the original Flashbait came up with the original version of what we know as the Blue Fox Pixie spoon. For anyone  traveling to northen Quebec to target landlocked Salmon around Lake St Jean, the Pixie is the go to bait up there."
1025798,chris.brock,2018-04-06 04:14:00,4053,Interesting about the Flashbait connection. I will ask Phil about it when I see him. He did mention there is a cult following for the Krinkles spoon in some areas of Quebec and guys order them by the hundreds.

1021743,Snidley,2018-01-24 20:57:00,620,Now that you mention it I believe Phil was his first name. I Googled the Lure King and came across an agent name on the government site for tradenames. I was dated in 2017 but I could not find a phone number or email that corresponded to the agency name. If someone really wanted these spoons they might get results from a snail mail request
1021746,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-24 21:51:00,10439,I think I know the ones you mean. Pretty sure I have a bunch of them from the lodge. The ones I have are chartreuse with orange diamonds. I'll have a look tonight if I remember.

I did some googling too and the Ticknovich brothers seem to be quite the entrepreneurs, lots of patents and trademarks. "
1021758,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-25 00:19:00,10439,Only found one of them. Must have lost the others or they're in a hidden tackle box somewhere. Man I got a lot of tackle boxes!!! On a happy note I found a big box crammed full of Johnson silver minnows and other weedless spoons.
1021760,Snidley,2018-01-25 00:59:00,620,These look similar but my experience with Lucky Strike lures is that they are cheaply made with poor quality hooks. I  believe they are heavier / per dimension than the Wrinkles so action is not the same. https://www.luckystrikebaitworks.com/tackle/lure-assortment/hammered-orange-brass-devil-bit-kit.html
1021765,chris.brock,2018-01-25 02:30:00,4053," I bought 5 of the 3.5 inch brass/ orange directly from Lucky Strike and tried to put a bend (undulation) in them myself, but yeah, definitely not the same, not even close."
1021779,Handlebarz,2018-01-25 12:44:00,3790,Looks like one of the old spoons that Gary from Thunderstock outfitters sold in his old shop up in eagle  lake give him a call (519) 353-8027 Im sure he would still have some he had many cards at the shop always extras to go around. The do the shows so if he has any around he might be able to bring with him this winter
1021782,AKRISONER,2018-01-25 13:36:00,5558,you got a pic of this thing? i wanna see the shape...it haunts me that I cant find another one like it. Bought a ton of daredevils but not a single one moves like that one did...i cant even explain how it darted up down and side to side sporadically while cranking slowly.  I find most spoons require you to burn them really fast to make em move that much.  Ive got that 5 of diamonds tattooed on the side of my leg! lol
1021796,BILLFISHERMC,2018-01-25 16:57:00,1,We use this lure for Landlock Salmon on Champlain. Some we tape with orange and different colours on the sides. Try Norms bait and tackle in Crown point. -ask for Brian.
1021798,bonessk01,2018-01-25 17:14:00,40,this is what I found on Lure King  of Mississauga its all very dated Maybe Blaney Mcmurtry coukld help 
1021946,Tdel,2018-01-27 20:00:00,393,"This was my favourite lure on the French River years ago, couldn't keep the Walleye and Pike of the hook.  I was the only one that had it and everyone with me were green with envy. I also bought it at Canadian Tire. "
1021956,Snidley,2018-01-27 23:35:00,620,I have a Quebecer buddy who goes to northern Quebec to fish for landlocked Atlantic Salmon and for them the magic lure is a Pixie. I'm told that the lodge owners sell them off of a rack in the lodge for big money once guys see how well they work and they find themselves without. This weeks InFisherman did some underwater footage tracking spoons and rattletraps for ice fishing and the difference between spoon action and even rattler action is astounding. The Williams Nipigon had the best action of the spoons I observed them testing. 
1021965,chrisb,2018-01-28 14:52:00,24,"The first lure posted, with the smooth finish, is red devil. Not sure about the hammered one.  "
1021966,scuro2,2018-01-28 15:40:00,904,"I'm with ChrisB ...eppinger red devil but the shape of the lure like in this collection, 2nd row.  "
1021976,cisco,2018-01-28 19:30:00,597,Looks like what I recall from many years ago as an Alligator spoon.
1021977,cisco,2018-01-28 19:35:00,597,http://www.lurepartsonline.com/Online-Store/Trolling-Spoons/Regal-Finish-Trolling-Spoons.html Looked for alligator ... crocodile spoon and this popped up which may do with a bit of orange paint...
1021979,Snidley,2018-01-28 20:19:00,620,"That original pic is probably a Daredevil but it's hard to be sure as there's a million knockoffs of that popular spoon( Len Thomson, Cabela's Canadian Spoon, etc). The Wrinkle is very different. It has a flip, as illustrated by the 3rd original pic. That flip at the front end of the spoon combined with the lighter weight / dimension of the lure makes for the sexy action that gets bit.  Years ago when Salmon trolling involved soaking spoons almost exclusively it was quite the trend to modify trolling spoons with pliers. You simply took a thin trolling spoon and bent the front of the lure up being carefull not to split the edges.. I used to do it to some of my Racs and fish did bite them so we all believed. Since those days the fish got smarter and now you have to troll around with elaborate trolling systems and bait to get on the bite. If you look at Luhr Jensen Croc spoons and even Acme Cleo, K-O Wobbler spoons they also feature a flip but they also feature a weight/dimension that basically overpowers the sexy swimming action that the Wrinkle exhibits. Mepps Syclops spoons also have a front flip but it's a flip up and then down that creates a different action to that of the Wrinkle. The Crocs and Syclops are also much thinner through the body width than the Wrinkle, a design that gets these spoons to sink fast...great in deep water, expensive in the shallows. Seems to me that anyone with rudimentary metal working skills could duplicate the flip found on the Wrinkle and if they did I for one would buy some. Maybe even find Phil and get the stamping pattern and go into business"
1022008,LittleWorm,2018-01-29 05:41:00,122,"I swear my dad must have half a dozen of those in his different tackle boxes! I have never tried one, I may just have to ""borrow"" one or two off the old man this year."
1022026,Rob,2018-01-29 16:17:00,467,"I am pretty sure I have met Phil, kind of an eccentric guy, but very nice and passionate about fishing. He use to make a lure called the Predator that I would use for lakers and salmon and always had luck with them. Then you couldn't buy them anymore. So like Chris i did some digging around and found his name and number and gave him a call. He told me if I wanted to come down to his shop in Toronto, he would ""hook me up"". I went there and we talked for a couple of hours and I left there with a box of those lures and and a bunch of different attraction decals to put on them. Still have some of those lures. I can't remember exactly where he was but it was in the Rexdale/Mississauga area. Keep at it Chris, you will find what you are looking for. Edit: Found this on Phil:"
1022038,Snidley,2018-01-29 17:34:00,620,"Good hunting Rob. I just talked to Phil at the above number and he does still have Wrinkles, Nastey Girls, Nastey Boys and Predator spoons to sell. He is willing to take calls re getting some for your tackle box and he is located in Mississauga. He has a charter fishing boat that goes out of bronte as well. We did not talk about the Nastey line but they were killer spoons as well."
1022043,chris.brock,2018-01-29 20:47:00,4053,"Good work Rob! I talked to Phil as well today, he sounds like a unique dude, lol. He should be advertising / marketing these things better and I'm sure he could sell a lot more stuff."
1022051,Garnet,2018-01-29 22:22:00,2056,Is he still making the float reel.
1022054,Snidley,2018-01-29 23:02:00,620,I did not ask but it was a crude very heavy unit that you would not like compared with todays product. Expensive too
1021681,chris.brock,2018-01-24 02:07:00,4053," In Jame's fly in report there's a picture of a spoon.  I'm pretty sure it's a red and white version of what me and some people I fish with call the ""magic lure"". Here's mine, it's retired, I won't use it anymore because I don't want to lose it.     They don't make them anymore, they were sold at CT and maybe elsewhere, my cousin still has 2, he says they're branded wrinkles or krinkles. When I wasn't using it, buddies in the boat would borrow it and hammered fish. The one I retired caught so many and big fish I had to retire it in the off season, lol. Years ago when the weren't sold anymore, I went to BPS and asked a sales guy about it, he said ""wow, you're the third guy this month to describe something like that , no clue though"". Anyone else recognize the bait or have any love for it?"

1021685,HTHM,2018-01-24 02:41:00,4082,What is the sense of having something and not using it? If you save it think of all the fish you won't catch.
1021686,Jmeyer,2018-01-24 02:53:00,83,Haven't seen those pitted jobs in years. I will check my stock I might have one of those. Wasn't those made by the Canadian tire no name lures?

1021720,BillM,2018-01-24 16:20:00,17367,So now we're comparing dying doing something you love to not using a favourite lure in case you lose it?  lol alright.
1021721,Acountdeleted,2018-01-24 16:32:00,2562,"Yup. Some of us are more passionate about fishing then others. (I kid I kid) I just meant that if something has luck to it, it got that way by using it. I'm as superstitious as they come but I don't think the luck of the lure will rub off just by being near the other lures. So all I was saying was, if something works, go for it. Make the most of it while you can rather then the fear of what might happen. A lot of things might happen, and we should be mindful of that, but it shouldn't stop us from doing or using the things we like best."

1021726,Snidley,2018-01-24 17:48:00,620,"Looks like a Wrinkle. I believe they were at one time called a Krinkle (that's what I have always called them) but I'm looking at one that is new in the package and the packaging calls it a Wrinkle (for some reason there is a K centered on a decal in the middle of the spoon). The manufacturer is Lure King, a company from Mississauga (Streetsville). That's the same firm that used to make Nastey Girl and Nastey Boy trolling and casting spoons. Those were killer products as well   At one time he also manufactured the original Loomis centerpin reels, those really heavy units that let to sore backs when teamed with a 13' rod. I have been to the guys factory but I forget his name and it is probably long gone now. I've never seen a red and white one (mine are all orange and gold) but that colour scheme is sensible especially for pike.

That thing had multiple 40+inch pike on it...until one day my line gave out on another monster pike and sure enough I could never find another one again. The thing absolutely danced at low speed, the pike absolutely hammered it, even caught walleye and bass on it all the time too. RIP"

1021735,Snidley,2018-01-24 19:34:00,620,I have a Len Thompson that looks similar to the Wrinkle but it's heavier and in the traditional Thompson style. It's caught nothing for me while the Wrinkle slays them

The originals were fairly thick and heavy ... there were many knock-offs made over the years, all of which were thinner and lighter. The originals usually fished better in deep water because they got down to the fish. In the shallows, the imitations often worked better because they wouldn't get stuck on bottom. I believe the Len Thompson company made some very similar spoons ... could be one of them. I have a number of retired lures and reels that now live on bookcase shelves in my office. Every time I look at them, I'm reminded of the great days on the water that they represent. It's nice ... especially in the dead of winter."

I retrieved it and it now is catagorized at my place as interior design artwork.  I don't own a rod heavy enough to cast it even if I was interested in catching slimedogs"
