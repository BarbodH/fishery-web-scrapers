My wife was in the other room and came out and asked ""what the heck was that"" My 1st thought was someone driving up the driveway and hit the house. Took a look around and nobody there so I went thru the house and everything was fine. A couple neighbors felt it too I but have no idea what it was other than maybe a mini-quake. Crazy stuff for sure."
1039150,aplumma,2019-01-12 14:11:00,6896,Check the pool table to see if it is still level Lew.  Art
1039151,lew,2019-01-12 14:25:00,12766,Already played a couple games today Art and the tables still good....just wish I was LOL
1039153,OhioFisherman,2019-01-12 15:56:00,6623,"Lew, did you ever see Tremors? It may have been one of those Precambrian worms! https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/gpq/1993-v47-n3-gpq1904/032960ar.pdf I didn't find any news reports, just this older seismic study."
1039156,lew,2019-01-12 17:45:00,12766,"Thanks for the link Paul, some interesting reading there. Not many earthquakes around here and certainly no big ones, but every once in awhile there'll be a little bump and I'm guessing that's what we felt yesterday. I was just talking to another neighbour and she felt it too so at least it wasn't my old brain playing tricks on me."
1039157,Jds63,2019-01-12 18:08:00,1365,could be a frost quake ... check google
1039158,lew,2019-01-12 18:16:00,12766,We've been getting the odd frost quake around here the last few nights but this was far bigger that any I've ever felt before.
1039159,misfish,2019-01-12 18:43:00,29133,I sure felt a bunch this morning Lew. Set the hook on a few.
1039168,ketchenany,2019-01-12 21:05:00,3229,Lew there is a fault in the Ottawa Valley which is active and one south of Toronto under Lake Ontario there may have been a shift. A few years back there was one shift that was felt all around us. Here is a chart where movement can/has happened. See that dot near Peterborough under you house lol.      
1039173,OhioFisherman,2019-01-13 00:28:00,6623,"I guess we get small ones in my area too Lew,  I have never felt one though in the past, and now I couldn't tell from my normal shaking. LOL"
1039175,Spiel,2019-01-13 00:41:00,9065,"There's plenty of seismic activity in the greater GTA. I've felt many a big bang, shake over the decades. They're not annual or frequent, but again not irregular. An active fault line does exist apparently under Lake O.  "
1039176,ketchenany,2019-01-13 00:56:00,3229,"Speil , make sure you are not tying an eye when this happens! I have only felt one,  my office was on the shore of Lake Ontario, but felt one more inland above Hwy 7. Shake it when you can,  there is nothing we can do. Lew  don’t worry we will be fine."
1039194,Headhunter,2019-01-13 17:42:00,5703,Any active mines up around you Lew? HH
