Good job i'm not one of those guys that either expects or relies on their spouse to cook for them. Not having made any supper plans myself I decided to hop on the Skidoo and get a couple of Crappie for a sammich. I returned 20 minutes later with two nice ones and cooked up a storm. Crappie, bacon and avocado on rye and pumpernickel with home made potato chips seasoned with crushed peppercorns and rock salt....YES. Only problem was I only got half the sammich as the wife and kid returned and I left half the meal to them on the kitchen table and fled for my life!  "

1039089,limeyangler,2019-01-11 17:48:00,5204,This song is for you TJ  
1039093,Acountdeleted,2019-01-11 18:32:00,2562,Dang that looks good.
1039108,Tomcat,2019-01-11 21:14:00,395,Great video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Envious of your access to your fishery.
1039110,misfish,2019-01-11 21:42:00,29133,"Yup. Vegetarian food. MMMMM BACON BACON BACON, AND WHITE FISH ON A BUN. "
1039113,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-11 22:09:00,8243,"If I depended on someone else feeding me I would waste away to nothing. I like avocado on certain things, fried fish maybe not. Now I'm jealous, going out for dinner tonight in Port Dover, a Lake Erie fishing village. I bet my 5 finger size pieces of frozen Perch is going to set me back 25 bananas with a Ceaser. If I cleaned fish in the kitchen I would be sleeping in the truck.  You are 110% right, potatoes should sit in water for a time to get most of the starch out so to crisp up but have never seen anyone wash them in a salt bath.  I hardly salt the pasta water anymore and maybe once a month will I fry something, maybe, tonight is a treat. I bake everything I would normally fry from Pork Shnitzels to fish in Panko crumbs. We are getting close to our Best Before date here. By the way Simon it's a sangwitch not sammich."

1039211,David Chong,2019-01-14 01:06:00,836,Looks very appetizing! I'd definitely eat that!
1039347,limeyangler,2019-01-16 17:09:00,5204,"Thanks David, I am going to be doing some of the cooking at a camp I work for guiding, can't wait to throw the rule book out of the window every now and then and offer something different to traditional shore lunch, might be a hard sell as a lot of guests want exactly that, but i'm sure some would enjoy it."
1039501,lunkerbasshunter,2019-01-20 00:51:00,2585,I clean crappie the same way!  Looks great!  Cheers!
1039523,limeyangler,2019-01-21 04:01:00,5204,"LOL, good to hear, some guy went ballistic at me on Youtube, check out his reply on my fish cleaning video, he wrote, ""It appears that your idea of a soft touch is a sledge-hammer. I suggest you watch a few videos on youtube of how to properly use the electric fillet knife and then trying it yourself on a dozen or so fish before trying to do another video.﻿"" LOLOL...holy moly, chill out dood!"
