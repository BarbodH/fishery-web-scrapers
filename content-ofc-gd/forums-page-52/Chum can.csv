1038912,misfish,2019-01-09 11:38:00,29133,Thing of the past Harold. I used 1 coat hanger and a soup can. Easy peezy. The one in the link is a bit over complicated IMO.

1038914,DanD,2019-01-09 11:41:00,2223,"I've made a few of these chum funnels before. For the sake of scale, the bolts are 1/4 inch in size. The first one I made, I found the funnel in the kitchen cupboard; wife never did find out where it went. Dan.  "
1038918,SirCranksalot,2019-01-09 13:52:00,3291,thx guys.  Brian- why a 'thing of the past'?  that funnel looks interesting. What's the purpose of the bolt on the lid---just to add weight/ I assume you need a friction fit between the lid and the funnel?

1038926,Jds63,2019-01-09 16:02:00,1365,"LOL no need to overcomplicate  ... take chum , put hand sized rock in with chum add water and freeze in a container take frozen rock and chum and drop down hole  .... it works  !!!!!"
1038928,Fisherman,2019-01-09 16:21:00,7201,"Well at least there's 2 of us that know this simple method works like a charm.  If you're real lucky, the rock will knock out the fish and it will come floating up for an easy catch. ?"
1038932,OhioFisherman,2019-01-09 16:52:00,6623,"I have never fished on the ice, but I made one years ago out of a plastic mustard container with a screw on lid. It was a bigger item though, like 1/2 gallon? I put a small screw eye with a couple of fender washers and a nut holding the eye to the lid and a 3-4 ounce lead weight bolted to the bottom and drilled 1/4 inch holes in the container. The plan was to attach a piece of parachute cord to the eye and drag it along the bottom on a drift an create a chum line, or tie it to a tree or dock and have it as a fish attract-er."
1038935,DRIFTER_016,2019-01-09 18:26:00,10439,I built one of the Grey/Bruce ones years ago. Mostly used it for chumming with spawn out of the boat when jigging whities up on Georgian Bay. Got a stubby solid glass rod and old reel with 60# mono on it for deployment.
1038989,DanD,2019-01-10 13:01:00,2223,The bolt has two jobs; on the way down it helps to keep the lid from opening. When the funnel is on the bottom and you lift up on the retrieval line; the funnel flips upside down and the weight of the bolt helps to pull the lid open. Dan.
