1039182,[email protected],2019-01-13 03:51:00,1,can some one please advise are these legal to use in Ontario considering there is a treble on each end and would not be classified as a artificial lure - Thanks 
1039184,John Bacon,2019-01-13 05:34:00,3277,The artificial lure requirement has been removed from the regulation.  Now all trebles count as a single hook regardless of whether or not they are attached to an artifical lure.  These should be perfectly legal.

1039196,John Bacon,2019-01-13 18:04:00,3277,Looks like a spreader.  It is common to use them with minnows when ice fishing. 
1039197,OhioFisherman,2019-01-13 18:40:00,6623,"We used spreaders here too John, the ones I have seen though were some variation of this though. https://www.stopperlures.com/scott_spreaders.html A common perch and crappie rig here, never seen one like that. Some of the ones that were sold here had a swivel snap that had a hole drilled in the middle of it and it was threaded on the wire thru it so you could attach a weight to it to get down deep faster."
