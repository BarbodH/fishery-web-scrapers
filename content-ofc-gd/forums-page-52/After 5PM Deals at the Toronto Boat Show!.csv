Today & tomorrow(Friday) if you attend after 5 PM the admission is only $5 for an adult and the parking is free! About as affordable as it comes these days! LOL Drop by and say hi at the Yamaha/Skeeter booth and say hi if you make it down! We can talk a little fishing, Skeeter Boats, Garmin Panoptix, Navionics or why the costs of boats have gone crazy thanks to our friendly politicians! LOL"
