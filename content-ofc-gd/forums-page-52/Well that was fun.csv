1039160,misfish,2019-01-12 18:50:00,29133,"Finally got on the bay this morning. To my surprise,we had 5-6 "" of solid black ice. Managed a bunch of herring and a whitie. Lost one near the hole. Fished with a bunch of buddies.       My oldest even made it out this morning with us.   Terry having a nap    Hey fishfarmer, it,s still getting used. Gave it to my son.     "
1039167,ketchenany,2019-01-12 20:54:00,3229,Way to go B. That froze fast!!! Who towed Terry back?
1039169,Terry,2019-01-12 21:10:00,14456,I wasn’t having a nap. Turkey. LOL it was good to get out
1039172,OhioFisherman,2019-01-13 00:22:00,6623,Terry have gas? you guys in a hut and him in quarantine?                    
1039174,Terry,2019-01-13 00:28:00,14456,Nice warm day. Who need a shelter till the wind picks up
1039177,John Bacon,2019-01-13 02:14:00,3277,"I was working in Barrie today.   I noticed that the huts all seemed to be on the south side of the bay.   Is that because the ice is safer; or, because the fishing is better there?  I am hoping to get out on the bay after work a few times.  I am working on the north side of the bay."
1039188,irishfield,2019-01-13 15:06:00,26272,HEY... Lloyd's looking for that chair !
1039191,Acountdeleted,2019-01-13 16:03:00,2562,Nice. Glad to hear you guys got out.
1039195,misfish,2019-01-13 17:55:00,29133,"Hey John It,s the best ice in the bay right now as it,s been solid up for a week. The fishing is ok. It,s my first ice spot til other areas firm up. It made another 1.5 "" over night, -18 at 6am this morning when I was all set up.  I was sitting in the same area as yesterday and had 7"" this morning.  It,s not the same all over. Knowing the bay and it,s habits is a big plus.  Another nice thing about this spot is parents can take their kids out . Not a long walk and can catch perch,herring ,smelt and white fish."
1039199,Terry,2019-01-13 19:01:00,14456,"not that chair, the bigger one that goes in my clam"
1039202,Beans,2019-01-13 20:06:00,3339,Sure looks like you are pulling a Roy...!
1039204,Terry,2019-01-13 20:39:00,14456,I had the camera  down and the monitor in my lap   It was -14 I think I would have froze to death if I fell asleep.  Lol
1039205,misfish,2019-01-13 21:25:00,29133,"I still would of dragged your sorry ass off the ice and brought you home, then drove the yamadoo  home. . .."
1039213,SirCranksalot,2019-01-14 01:49:00,3291,"And leave the body on the porch, Chevy Chase""Vacation"" style???"
1039221,Fish Farmer,2019-01-14 12:29:00,2234,"Hi Bro, that's great your son has it, hope he has the luck I had with it. Wish now I should have kept it. That Clam Scout I bought is a little small for 3 holes, one for trans, 2 to fish and with heater, it's tight. Seeing you guys have ice, I may have to make the trek up to Simcoe. I don't think we'll get safe ice for the harbor here and Long Point is going to be iffy. Love to do the Whitie thing one day. All I need to see now is seeing you with a couple flopping around your feetwill just get me craving."
1039224,Beans,2019-01-14 14:15:00,3339,Just had to share...  
1039229,Fish Farmer,2019-01-14 15:37:00,2234,"Had a permanent hut for years on Simcoe and you wouldn't believe the stuff that happened to my hut, your joke was one of them. Little to say I had to move it, wife was pretty disgusted."
1039231,AKRISONER,2019-01-14 16:07:00,5558,"what a beauty weekend it was, not a cloud in the sky and crisp -20 mornings and dead calm -10 sunny afternoons. I swear to god it feels 100 times warmer when its -10 sunny and calm then when its 0 and cloudy. My buddy couldnt help falling asleep either, those sunny afternoons called for a nap. I even got a sunburn, and met a local who directed me the way of a bush trail that I was not aware of that allows me to fish in one of my favourite fishing grounds. Lots of people were concerned about this ice season, i think we are just getting started on a long hardwater season. Time will tell!"
1039316,John Bacon,2019-01-16 02:41:00,3277,"Thanks, the north side will probably be safe by the time I can get out."
1039470,misfish,2019-01-18 23:39:00,29133,"I,ll do my best this weekend brudder."
1039493,lunkerbasshunter,2019-01-19 23:55:00,2585,some good ice will be built this weekend!  Looks like it was fun!  Cheers!
