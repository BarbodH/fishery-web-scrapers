1038613,Terry,2019-01-02 13:57:00,14456,Still no real ice at ibp -15 and no wind. Really thought it would make ice south of the 7th ice is starting  
1038614,misfish,2019-01-02 14:09:00,29133,"I thought for sure as well it was going to at-least skim over. I didn't check the bay this morning. Had to start WORK, early this morning."
1038644,SirCranksalot,2019-01-03 00:26:00,3291,Hey---don't be using 4 letter words like that on here!!
1038648,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-03 04:38:00,8243,"I hope you get ice very soon, us too. Once the lake freezes the winds generally subside the massive winds and waves from the south."
