Anything around Kinmount nice and solid? Any help would be more than appreciated, I just wanna wet my line and maybe catch a fish or two."

758642,Acountdeleted,2013-01-12 17:56:00,2562,I'm going to be heading to Haliburton on Tuesday. Its the only place I can be sure the ice is good.
758802,deffect,2013-01-13 03:48:00,15,"Went out to a small back lake 30 min north of Halliburton this morning. Ice is a mess. Maybe 3"" of decent ice, And it was disappearing very fast. Supposed to be warm all day/night and rain and warm Sunday.don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but Could spell disaster for ice anywhere south of the bay? Be careful and good luck."
