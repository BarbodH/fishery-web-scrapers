758883,bigugli,2013-01-13 16:08:00,6138,"Apparently they are rebuilding their website.  Some lodges do completely shut down in winter, and you may wait 2-3 weeks for a response."
758889,Dave Bailey,2013-01-13 16:42:00,1641,Here is the reply I got:     Looks like the address is gone completely.
758922,BillM,2013-01-13 18:30:00,17367,So Rock Haven no longer uses Xplornet as their ISP.
758925,Dave Bailey,2013-01-13 18:46:00,1641, Might have to go old school and telephone them. What is this world coming to?
758947,porkpie,2013-01-13 20:09:00,2521,"I would t be surprised if Rockhaven  slid right off into the lake and disappeared!  For all the years we have been on the lake, it has gotten worse and worse, with little to no repair!  I'm not surprised their email doesn't work.  Hardly anything else does!  Try the phone!"
759013,Dave Bailey,2013-01-14 01:35:00,1641," What I liked about them was the huge parking area, just what's needed for a load of vehicles with trailers."
759085,porkpie,2013-01-14 14:22:00,2521,"Well they do have lots of space, that's true... That and a good selection of penny candy for the kids on Saturday afternoons!"
