758660,DOS,2013-01-12 20:22:00,119,"Just wondering, with the temps and the melt I would think the levels would be high or even blown out.  My head out tomorrow, just need to know should I head north or south...  RED"

758667,davey buoy,2013-01-12 20:48:00,5505,"Not as much snow south,maybe not as much run off?"
758668,Christopheraaron,2013-01-12 21:13:00,3525,"More snow up north, but colder Less snow down south but warmer  I'm guessing its about even"
758669,BillM,2013-01-12 21:23:00,17367,If you head up here you'd have more vis in your dbl/dbl from Tim Hortons then you would the Notty right now.
758681,davey buoy,2013-01-12 22:25:00,5505,Yesterday drove by two different TO rivers and surprisingly they were more or less running at normal speed. Not sure on clarity.
758704,misfish,2013-01-12 23:27:00,29133,"I took a stop by the notty. Save yer gas. 5ft and rising. Like Bill said,dbl dbl. Looks like a good sleep in day Sunday."
758706,Fang,2013-01-12 23:30:00,1330,West end lake O tribs turned from green to brown this afternoon. Checked credit 16 and bronte while out shopping today
758711,brkygetr,2013-01-12 23:41:00,425,"I'll be off Huron, had a look tonight on the way home. Liked what I saw. With it being this warm in January I will not be skipping the day when its the only one off. Flow looked real nice, might be a little dirty but if we do not get any rain tonight I expect tomorrow morn to have some nice water. I'll post the pics if I can for those that stayed home, looked out the wiondow, drinking a coffee and wondering."
758713,davey buoy,2013-01-12 23:46:00,5505,"That's a great attitude,but 100% chance of rain tonight and tomorrow.That may give you a rough go?.Good luck!"
758721,brkygetr,2013-01-12 23:57:00,425,"Good point....I just checked..  ....I might be pooched....but the way I look at it is the sky was clear over the lake and house when I turned off the gravel. Thats all I need, that and I am thawing out my last batch of eggs over the woodstove right now. There's no turning back! Might have to tie them a wee on the large side, up the weight, feel the bounce,...wait for it...wait for it... and have my rod to get ripped out of my hand!! Think positive, get wet, and come home grumpy. Thats my plan."
758898,DOS,2013-01-13 17:06:00,119,"Thanks guys, I decided to stay home< rained pretty good last night< might try when it cools off a wee bit...  RED"
759207,esoxansteel,2013-01-14 21:56:00,1307,"This will be a decent week when the rivers start to drop and clear, might have to use up some holidays"
759210,misfish,2013-01-14 21:59:00,29133," Just call in sick.LOL  Yep,hope it clears up by the weekend,and the colder temps tighten up the ice on the lakes again."
