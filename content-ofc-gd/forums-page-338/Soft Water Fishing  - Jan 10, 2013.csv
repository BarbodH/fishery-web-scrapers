758313,superdad,2013-01-11 14:32:00,353,"With the weather forecast for plus 2or 3, Laker John and I headed out to dig the boat out of the snow and see if we might be able to put it in the water for some fishing.  Thanks to the ice fishers near my place a road had been plowed past my trailer and we shovelled a twin row about 30 feet and the boat was ready to go. Gather the gear and head for Finkles.  We got there aound 1100 and set up the boat and we were ready to go.  You can see how clean and dry the ramp is - not a problem.  We headed west and started a troll past the generating station but we weren't marking fish so we decided to head towards the light house. A boat approached us from the east and pulled along side and we had a chat. This chap had been fishiing the week after Xmas and had done real well. We parted and he headed west and once around the lighthouse point,we never saw him again - don;t know where he was fishing.  The last time we were out we had success in the middle in deep water and we trolled upwind to Lyons Island, when we truned and headed east. Trolling eastward we began to mark lot of fish .   The winds had died down and the sun beat down on us and it was very pleasant. Another boat appeared at the lighthouse and trolled very close to shore and past Lyons Island, when we last saw them they were out in the middle opposite the Island.     Knowing we had a healthy run back to the ramp and wanted to get things put away in daylight, we headed back at 1515, the run at 17MPH was 45 miinutes. Boat on the trailer, strip the gear and head for home at 1420.  The water was 34.5 degs F.  We tried an assortment of lures at differing depths but weren't able to put the lure in front of one to grab it. Nontheless  we had a great day.  We're going to watch the weather like hawks and see if we can get out again soon.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad"

758476,spincast,2013-01-11 23:33:00,3279,"oh, that makes me want to be out there, thanks for the report  ...but the water levels still look really low? Is that a dock and a cleat on the top right of the first pic, or a diving board mount?"
