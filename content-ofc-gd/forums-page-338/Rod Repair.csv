758894,grimsbylander,2013-01-13 16:55:00,3016,Well I've got a 7.0' Quantum Superlite PT rod that I shortened by an inch or so. I'm hoping that I can take it somewhere and get the second line guide removed and add a tip guide. I was rushing around before work one morning trying to get some rods and tackle ready for a last minute outing for my son. What a way to start the day. Does anyone know someone in the St. Catharines to Oakville region that can do this?

758903,grimsbylander,2013-01-13 17:29:00,3016,Thanks Kemper. pm sent

758908,kemper,2013-01-13 17:49:00,2232," Spiel is probably your man - I suspect he may even have the tip you need laying around...  My spare parts box is growing, but I imagine Spiel has a spare parts warehouse!"
758956,Spiel,2013-01-13 21:24:00,9065," Thanks Bud.  No intention to undermine your offer, just thought I might be a little handier given the OP's location."
