758318,bigugli,2013-01-11 14:40:00,6138,"We used to have small arms instructors who had no problem pegging targets with the old LeeEnfield III and IV at ranges of 1 mile without all the gadgets.  I still remember... "" Downs!!! Having trouble finding the target??  25 pushups for each round missed.""     The 5 with the lowest scores that day got an extra trip to the Assault course. You got proficient real quick"
758327,lew,2013-01-11 14:50:00,12766, My grandfather was a sniper with the British Army in the trenches of France during WW1 and it was the old LeeEnfields he used also. Said it was a heavy gun but deadly accurate.
758338,Dave Bailey,2013-01-11 15:45:00,1641,"Could have used that 40 years ago. I have a small blurred patch dead centre of my right eye, makes it difficult to aim at all. Don't know how I ever got my Leading Infantryman qualification, must have been a backlog on the paperwork that day. I could fire off a full 20-round magazine with the old FN 7.62mm C1, and when I looked at the target it wasn't much of a grouping, more like an area code."
758342,TennesseeGuy,2013-01-11 15:52:00,957, Negative reinforcement is effective.  I've been given several doses.
