758063,Reelaction,2013-01-10 15:37:00,33,"Me and the Mrs. are going Saturday.  We want to check out deals on either the Lund Impact 1875 or Crestliner Raptor 1850  Don't want to start a debate on welded vs rivets but I am interested in peoples opinion on various marinas located in Southwestern ON. I'm located in Kitchener and would prefer to buy from a dealer within a 2 hour radius.  PM's are welcome so as not to advertise or bash any particular dealer.  Thanks, Chris"

It was worth it for me to travel 6 hours there to go get my 1850 raptor from him!"
