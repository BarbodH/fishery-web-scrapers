759067,jedimaster,2013-01-14 12:54:00,3472,If anyone wants to work on some good press there is a mute swan(the white one with orange beak and black bump on its nose) that has been suspected to have swallowed a fish hook as it was seen with fishing line hanging out of its mouth. It is identifiable as its beak is broken. It is trying to be found to be taken in for surgery. It was last seen near bluffers park in toronto. Let me know and i'll send some more details.
