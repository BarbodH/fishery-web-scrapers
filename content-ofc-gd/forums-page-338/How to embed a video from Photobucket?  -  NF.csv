Is there something that can be done to the new site to rectify this or am I sol?  TJunkie  "

758677,Leecher,2013-01-12 22:10:00,7832,"Terry,  Thanks for trying!  I got the same results as yours using the direct link code.  On the previous O/S we were able to embed videos as long as you had toggle the post option on ""HTML Auto"" before submitting your post.  Now, it only seem to accept direct link causing to open a new browser window  Hoping someone can find the answer to this.

758678,Terry,2013-01-12 22:11:00,14456,the middle one seems to work for me but not the way I would like
758679,Leecher,2013-01-12 22:14:00,7832, Yeah it does but still opens up a new window... not how it use to be where you clicked the play button and watch the video on the same page.
758748,Leecher,2013-01-13 00:47:00,7832,Looks like I'm out of luck   after sifting through the Google kingdom   no answer to this   Ah well there goes the ping pong videos
758754,misfish,2013-01-13 00:59:00,29133,I tried to make vid on PB first. Didnt work. Had to go you tube way.          SHAME 
758756,Leecher,2013-01-13 01:04:00,7832," Yeah, I know B... but I ain't uploading any videos to youtube just because of the new O/S upgrade on this site.   I'll wait and see if PB get's with the program and produce new code for todays HTML language"
