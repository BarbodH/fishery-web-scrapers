758904,mike rousseau,2013-01-13 17:32:00,4661,I have a question for everyone....  I went out in my boat yesterday.... If I flipped and had to be rescued should I have to pay????  It was nice and warm and the launch was spotless...  However it was 32 degree water temps... And in a boat in January in Canada..... Ice flows coming down the river...  In many ways I was putting myself  at a higher risk then during summer months... And many people said I was crazy....  What about all the boats on the Niagra most of the winter... Should they pay if they flip and need a life saving rescue..?????  Or superdad fishing 17 miles from the closest open launch in quinte...  Anglers pushing the limits and taking risks in their boats get a pat on the back but ice anglers are labeled as irresponsible undereducated idiots that should have to pay for getting into a bad situation....  I know if I pushed the limits and needed rescue I would hope that the tens of thousands of dollars I pay in taxes each year would have covered me... Considering my community has spent millions in the past few years on hockey rinks and a curling club ill probably never use... I think the occasional rescue for outdoorsman should be covered.... If not... Where the heck do my tax dollars go... To the hockey rink for my neighbors to enjoy...? And I get bupkis....? That doesn't seem right to me...  I don't complain about paying taxes and insurance out the nose... But I'd like to think that the one time I might have to cash in on services and equipment I've paid for with my tax dollars my whole life... That I wouldn't have to REPAY for what I've already paid for...  Mike
758906,kemper,2013-01-13 17:39:00,2232," I would think there is a much higher risk of going through crap ice on a warm rainy day then of flipping your boat...  Of course people head out in 12' tinnys on the big lake in January, and I think that's pretty stupid as well (in most cases)."
758910,fishindevil,2013-01-13 17:56:00,6254,The bottom line is they put the lives of the rescuers at risk because of stupidity !!!! When they might have been needed elsewhere where there might have been a real serious accident !!!! You can't fix stupid .......
758920,misfish,2013-01-13 18:29:00,29133,"Funny how no one said anything about the kid on the shore,saying ""Is that a kid,whats a kid doing out there"" Even he knew better..  Smart lad."
758926,drwxr,2013-01-13 18:51:00,453,"all the gear left on the ice will attract some new ""ice testers"" in a couple of days."

758943,rmarentette,2013-01-13 19:47:00,124,"It's interesting that just days ago, some members of this forum called a police officer stupid for walking on thin ice to warn them of the hazard because they ignored his pleas from shore. Fortunately nothing happened. Imagine if that ""stupid"" officer had fallen through the ice and drowned. He did this because he cared and caring is part of his job. This shows disrespect for police officers, firefighters and rescue personel who go above and beyond their duty to make sure these same ""adults"" return home to their families. I can only imagine what these ""stupid"" individuals go through when they have to inform the survivors that their loved ones aren't coming home. I hope I never get so selfish or stubborn to put someone's life at risk because of lack of patience. I also hope I never get foolish enough to take these wonderful people for granted. This story had a happy ending, but I'm not sure some people will learn from this. It never happens to me, it's always the other guy."
758952,crappieperchhunter,2013-01-13 20:33:00,2582,I agree with you 100% Mike. Well to a point. First time rescue should be  covered. Everyone should get one mulligan. But that bonehead on Simcoe last year talking about this being the 3rd time for him..I say he should be money out of his pocket. And take away his fishing license for life.
758972,misfish,2013-01-13 22:28:00,29133,"  Steve When I was scouting lakes north of here just before the new year,I went to Airport rd to see if there was guys out. It was first ice,lots of snow and slush for the most of it. They were all the way over by the island. I said ,well you know. That was just crazy. I even talked to some locals that fish the area and said,NO WAY."
758996,crappieperchhunter,2013-01-14 00:30:00,2582, Not sure what point your trying to make Brian.
759004,chris.brock,2013-01-14 00:58:00,4053,"not to hijack the thread,  I had to be rescued from a canoe trip a few years ago. We didn't have to pay. I imagine it was fairly expensive too.  here's the link for those who haven't seen it  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=66593&hl=missinaibi  it's the same sort of thing, doing something a little risky (maybe not as dumb thin ice in warm weather on Simcoe)  I'm interested in hearing some opinions on if we should have been charged. I won't be offended."
759010,Oggie,2013-01-14 01:23:00,588,"MIke you weren't told by authorities not to go on the Niagara River. The conditions hadn't deteriorated to the point of being unsafe. Reasonable risks are part of life and nobody thinks you should be billed for an accident that happens if you've taken reasonable precautions. Same applies to you Chris. Crap happens!  Now if you're told to stay off of the Niagara because the ice on Erie is moving and there's a blizzard coming in that will hamper visibility then yeah I'd say bill you for the rescue. You didn't listen to the warnings.  If you drive around a barricade on a closed highway I think you're billed, are you not? Dan O."

759044,Sinker,2013-01-14 05:29:00,8692,"I do all kinds of risky things. Breaking ice in my boat to duck hunt. Going out on lake O in the winter in a small boat, walking loooong distances in really cold weather, even ice fishing on thin ice. There is a fine line between stupid, and risky. I've never had to be rescued, because I'm not an idiot!! These guys were plain stupid. I think they should pay. What if it was your house on fire while these clowns were being rescued and the firetrucks didn't make it in time? Would that change your mind? What if one of your kids was in a serious accident and the EMT's were pulling these idiots from the lake? What if someone had a heart attack, and the ambulances were busy waiting for these guys to get to shore and they die?? I could go on and on. It was plain stupid for these IDIOTS to be on that ice. Period!  Plain and simple, these guys made a stupid decision going out there. Experienced or not, it was a dumb thing to do!  Mike, your boating situation is a whole different can of worms. You are not taking much of a risk by going out in a boat in cold water/weather. There is a slight chance crap could happen, but very good odds you will be just fine. If something did happen, and you needed to be rescued it would be a fluke. These guys should have known better. When you pull up to lake simcoe, and NOBODY is on the ice, that should be your first clue!! If they were in a boat, they would have been fine!!  Chris, your rescue was exactly why we have these services. It was an UNEXPECTED accident. Stuff happens.  To knowingly risk your life for something as simple as a fish, when you very well should know better is stupid! I hope they have to pay back every red penny! Taking a license away, or creating more legislation isn't going to do squat!!  Ski off the slopes in BC and see how fast your billed for the rescue!  S."
759076,crappieperchhunter,2013-01-14 13:50:00,2582,I go out on early ice and have never been rescued either. I take it pretty seriously Shayne and I think you know that. I however think everyone needs one freebie because stuff can happen. I could be out on marginal ice and some idiot could pass between my shore access on a machine and weaken the ice or it could just crack and shift on its own and I could go for a swim when I'm trying to get off. I understand where your frustration comes from with regards to people making really bad decisions. However that's what these services are for. Say your not very handy but you decide to do some home renos. You end up having an accident with a power tool and have to call for help. At the same time some kid dies because they came to help you instead of going there first. Or your a smoker and you fall asleep watching the TV and your butt starts a fire... and while the fire crew is at your place another accident happens somewhere else and someone croaks because there dealing with a fire set by a moron who fell asleep with a lit cigarette.  Do you see my point?  I just can't see how you can enforce payment for a rescue if some are deemed good rescues and some are deemed bad based on people's poor decisions?  I think the only way they could do it fairly would be to make every rescue pay...and that is one big slippery slop. That is why I made the suggestion of one free rescue and then you pay and lose your license. To me a repeat offence demonstrates your unwillingness to take proper safety measures. A first offense might be an honest mistake or a poor decision...but a second offence...clearly you didn't learn anything the first time around. And my suggestion for a license removal is to try and keep this idiot from passing this behavior onto others. You are correct and it might not stop him from going out...but then again it might. I try to respect the law and I know if I had my license taken away I wouldn't be going out again. At the very least maybe the bozo will disregard the law and fish but maybe he will have enough decency to go alone rather then take someone else which would also keep them from passing on bad decision making.  It's a complex problem for sure and I'm not in a position to change anything. It's just unfortunate when this stuff happens.
759080,misfish,2013-01-14 14:11:00,29133," My point was about new ice and snow covered, Steve thats all.    YUP  The guy was even walking a path made by others,and still went in. Lucky his freinds were close by.   "
759136,GreenCanada,2013-01-14 17:58:00,375," I couldn't agree more. I can't wait to see how much they were fined for the rescue, hopefully it is the majority of what the total effort cost. Just because we pay taxes, etc does not mean that you get freebies on making extremely poor decisions. Well, they did get a freebie, they get to live to see another day. They should be thankful for that and pay up.   I'm glad they were recused, but now they need to pay for their own stupidity, by paying the rescue bill.     I don't pay taxes to let people make what are obviously poor decisions, especially when they were (or would have been if they checked the conditions through various sources) informed through numerous outlets. You are correct, we pay taxes for them to be ready. I for one am glad they were rescued, but they should be made to pay for their poor decisions or others may act just as selfish and unnecessarily put other rescuers at risk.   I think their mulligan should be that they can be thankful they were rescued. They made an extremely poor decision and should be held responsible. If they are that impatient to fish on obviously unsafe ice, they should head further North to take advantage of the hard water."
759254,kickingfrog,2013-01-14 22:55:00,8333,FWIW The local tv news has been polling people about whether or not people should be fined for these types of rescues.
759258,davey buoy,2013-01-14 23:03:00,5505,"Just watching Barrie news,charges will be laid!!!!  2 fellows $1500.00 each!"
759261,misfish,2013-01-14 23:10:00,29133,$1500 each to the two that went in. Not the two that tried to rescue them.
759264,Steve,2013-01-14 23:14:00,2075,"hope this starts to make some ice fisherman think twice before putting others in danger.  i'm guessing its actually $3k to the father, as it was a father son team that went in, no?"
759268,davey buoy,2013-01-14 23:19:00,5505,I heard two fines!
759334,Guest,2013-01-15 01:43:00,0,Saw that the guys that got rescued had to leave there gear on the ice.  Right now theres about 5 or 6 sleds full of stuff.  Im heading out whos with me lol.
759342,kickingfrog,2013-01-15 02:02:00,8333,An interesting bit from the news footage that I saw tonight.  The guys are being checked out on land after being rescued and in the background is a young girl in shorts and a t-shirt.
758788,irishfield,2013-01-13 02:53:00,26272,True enough... but in quest of a fish we.. okay some I go fishing with.. push our luck at times and could be swimmers on many given days. Even during great cold winters... swimming is just a vent hole away.
758789,kemper,2013-01-13 02:53:00,2232," Bill are you saying that 1"" of black ice and 3 inches of slush doesn't hold up in +12 and rain?"
758791,kemper,2013-01-13 02:55:00,2232," No doubt about that, but I prefer to at least eliminate the risk of ""died of pure stupidity"" from my fishing mishap list.  Of course I could step onto an inconsistent patch and drown even on good ice, but hopefully the chances are much lower. "
758792,Sinker,2013-01-13 03:03:00,8692,"Come on wayne, I can't believe your making excuses for these idiots! That's right, idiots! I hope they read this, because they are idiots!!! They should be ashamed of themselves for the rest of their lives! Just imagine the horror that poor kid went thru! It blows my mind how stupid people are, and they just keep getting more stupid every generation!  They better have to pay every red penny for their rescue. If it was up to me, I would have left them all out there to fend for themselves! Idiots!!!  S."
758803,Guest,2013-01-13 03:50:00,0,"Was out on Cooks Bay on Thursday and was alright.  Didnt feel threatened at all while catching over 150 perch.  Say what you want, but I have enough experience to know when then ice is safe."
758804,HTHM,2013-01-13 03:52:00,4082,"The next time you do something that requires an emergency response, bear your attitude in mind, and fend for yourself. It is situations like this that determine if we are humane, or callous and uncaring."
758806,BillM,2013-01-13 04:24:00,17367," Common sense would dictate you don't go ice fishing when it's 12 degrees out and there's crap ice to begin with.  Unless you're some sort of ice whisperer, you didn't know what your next footstep would bring in those conditions.  Don't kid yourself."
758817,4x4bassin,2013-01-13 06:09:00,1025,"Just think of all the wasted resources being out on Simcoe rescuing those guys tonight , don't get me wrong i'm glad no one got hurt but "" guys come on, really """

758819,dhickey,2013-01-13 06:18:00,1038,      I think that if an adult wants to risk their own well being than so be it.    but to risk the well being of a child well that in my mind is neglegent in every scence.12 c.   5 inches of ice at best reported Thursday morn and the warming trend had allready set in? Thats just STUPID. I also have gone for a unexpected swim in a back lake. By the time we got back to the house i was full on hypo. Thanks to my uncles quick thinking im still here.I was 9yrs old. Allmost 2ft of ice but we hit a hloe. I hope they have to pay for their gross neglagence and if they took some one under the age of 18 out with them then they all should be criminaly charged. No excuse for stupidity...
758820,dhickey,2013-01-13 06:20:00,1038,Not shure what happend with my post??

758830,fishindevil,2013-01-13 10:06:00,6254,Well so far this year the adults involved get the Darwin Award for sure !!!!!! And ya to endanger the kid is another kick in the asshat award lets see what happens today it has rained hard and still is here in bobcaygeon and sturgeon lake is looking pretty dark in spots !!! I didn't see any open water yesterday up in Haliburton in fact they are still out in their shacks and one guy told me he has 8 inches at his hut on kashagawigamog  lake and seen huts on a few smaller lakes up there as well the locals up here on sturgeon lake moved their few huts off on Friday !!! Good call for them not sure about pigeon lake there was a few huts out there the river in bobcaygeon is open a fair bit into the lake very dangerous areas and the lower Trent is predicting possible flooding they will be releasing water today
758831,Guest,2013-01-13 10:29:00,0,You didnt hear buddy.  I am the ice whisperer.
758839,misfish,2013-01-13 11:22:00,29133,"True enough Wayne. I am one that will venture out on ice that many may not.  A good example is 3 years ago at IBP. Guys walking everywhere. One wrong step,and they were going in. Inconsitant ice . Ya me along with others you know were out there.   IMO Yesterday was not the day to be out. That had to be a given to any ice angler."
758840,moxie,2013-01-13 11:39:00,1566,"They shouldn't have been out there and once they regain the feeling in their extremities including ""la cabeza"" they should have to do some community service considering what the community did for them today. I would consider that more than fair punishment ."
758847,jedimaster,2013-01-13 13:46:00,3472,"Really hard to say but I don't really have a problem with services rendered  being billed for extreme activities, ice fishing, snow mobiling, boating at high speeds, ice climbing, motorcross etc.... these are all activities where you are knowingly putting yourself at a higher risk of needing rescue. Maybe an exchange of community services or something. This rescue and the ones last year on simcoe are not eve comparable to needing paramedics because you had a heart attack or a drunk driver knocked you off the road etc...there was a warning out, heck I even posted it on here. The temps were high and wet. Obviously the ice was not safe. Its incidents like this that get parking access removed and access ramps chained up. You want to complain about those things look fist at the ice fisherman that make the news. When's the last time you saw a group of ice fisherman on the news for something good like cleaning up a park or whatever."
758849,davey buoy,2013-01-13 13:50:00,5505,"Your right,ice fisherman could use a little good press. Too bad it's such a small,small percentage causing these problems."
758852,kevin booth,2013-01-13 14:08:00,57,cant fix stupid.
758874,dhickey,2013-01-13 15:25:00,1038,But you can fine it.  Now lets just think about this. 4 morons go icefishing for pertch... 4 morons go swimming. Its 12c and the sun is shining and no snow to shield the ice from the sun almost all day. several highly trained men risk their safety in order to rescue 4 morons from their own foolishness.  Ive thought for several years that their should be a seperate licence for ice fishing a one time written exame just like a boating licence and that woud probably keep most idiots away from ice fishing and educate those that dont understand how ice conditions and weather are so closely linked together.  I wonder if they were checked for fishing licence?  And yes I have absolutly no pitty for those idiots.
758875,kevin booth,2013-01-13 15:40:00,57,"good idea salty dog ice fishing licence,i like it and if you do a stupid stunt and need rescue you can loose your licence,i like that."
758886,richyb,2013-01-13 16:34:00,774,Maybe they are rookie fisherman and read on a fishing board that people were fishing there so they made a drive north to fish and just figured the ice was safe?. I have met lots of people on the ice that say they read these different fishing boards but never sign up. I figure if your too lazy to sign up to the fishing boards then you dont deserve to read the valuable information thats posted inside. Most of the boards I visit have way more guests and visitors than members checking out the threads.
758892,jedimaster,2013-01-13 16:51:00,3472,"Don't forget the yahoos from last year, one the guys was pretty much bragging how he had been rescued 3 times now on the ice... wonder if this was time number 4 ?"
758895,kemper,2013-01-13 16:59:00,2232," If you rely on the internet to tell you if the ice is safe or not, you're still an idiot for going swimming in that type of weather/ice conditions."
758896,Oggie,2013-01-13 17:01:00,588,They need to deal with reckless people like this before they ruin it for the rest of us. Fine them for the cost of the rescue.  The MNR can't enforce the fishing licenses we currently issue. Not much hope for a winter ice fishing licence. The guys that need regulating (ie. walk out on unsafe ice) wouldn't buy the licence anyway. The rest of us would buy the licence to comply. Kind of like the gun registry; the bad guys don't register their guns. Dan O.
758690,misfish,2013-01-12 23:02:00,29133,When will people learn. 4 people pulled out of cooks bay..

Sure they are much safer but they give people a false sence of safety and they think they can walk on water. I have been wondering all day today as to where people would go for a dunk.

If it ever happens again I will most certainly fess up  but this is bordering on utter insanity given the conditions last season and this season so far.

Seems like anyone with half a brain should have been able to figure out that ice that already wasn't safe probably didn't get any better with this weather.  I don't get it, continues to happen again and again."
