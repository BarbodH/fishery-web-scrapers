758543,ehg,2013-01-12 04:03:00,2666,Ya had Plymouth Voyager back in 90's it was stolen couple of times.  Once i bought the Club steering wheel thingy the thefts stopped..Must deter them. You might want to try one of them.
758566,Handlebarz,2013-01-12 08:24:00,3790,Dang Chris that sucks for sure.  I know that where I live the thieves travel from where they live to rip off the people who work for a living one reason is they know they will get there azzes beaten of they rip off there neighbours. Also there is better stuff on the other side of town.
758589,solopaddler,2013-01-12 13:33:00,8605,It was the muggings you told me about last year that had me worried. This just clinches it.
758592,Rich Clemens,2013-01-12 13:43:00,3131, The courts should order them to but you a brand new vehicle - make 'em pay for there actions.
758658,pics,2013-01-12 20:00:00,1268,This stuff happens everywhere. The court system doesn't take it seriously enough
758289,Live2fish85,2013-01-11 13:25:00,1633,"Wow. Wake up this morning to find out that our van was stolen. Gotta love these scrum bags, two baby seats in it and they still steal it."
758290,Gerritt,2013-01-11 13:28:00,6129,That sucks! Hopefully the police find it and they haven't trashed it.  Good luck
758292,lew,2013-01-11 13:32:00,12766,"Damn, I HATE thieves !!  And sadly, when and if their caught, they'll probably get off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.  Hope it all works out for you.  "
758301,I'mHooked,2013-01-11 13:59:00,525,"That sucks Chris, sorry to hear. Crappy start to any day."
758302,NAW,2013-01-11 14:03:00,4022,Brutal!  Sorry to hear about that.  Seems hard for you to catch a break sometime!   My boss was a raptors game this week and had his truck raided..  At least all of your fishing gear was not in there.  I hope..
758308,bigugli,2013-01-11 14:16:00,6138,"Been there a couple of times.  Worst example resulted in a police chase with $7Gs and 6 weeks in repair costs to our Oldsmobile.  The punk had just gotten out of jail 2 weeks earlier for, you guessed it, auto theft. 2 days later he was again released on his own recognizance pending trial. He would have been safer in jail."
758312,Live2fish85,2013-01-11 14:26:00,1633,Thanks guys. I hope I find the scum bag that stole it. I know our system is a joke here. As stated he will get a slap on the wrist.
758315,Leecher,2013-01-11 14:34:00,7832,Sorry to hear Chris    Hope the police recover your van without any serious damage to it.
758324,Fish Farmer,2013-01-11 14:47:00,2234,"Sorry to hear that Chris, happened to me years ago, felt like someone had stabbed me in the heart, what a feeling, can't explain. Your van will never feel the same if they recover it."
758330,Live2fish85,2013-01-11 15:29:00,1633,"Yea Fish Farmer I know what you are talking about, I feel sick just thinking about it."
758333,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-11 15:35:00,2690,"Oh no, Chris!!!!!!  That really sucks!!  I'll send you a message later, bud."
758334,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-11 15:37:00,10439,With any luck they piled it into a bridge abutment and died in gigantic fireball!!!!!
758350,Canuck2fan,2013-01-11 16:08:00,1444,"Wow stealing a van with child seats in it has to be a new low... Hopefully you get it back in good shape. A good punishment would be to have the loser who stole it have to tow it in dog sled traces through your town for 10 miles while wearing a huge sign saying ""I am a total degenerate."" Then have him spent about 5yrs getting a daily ""massage"" from his 35Olb 7ft tall cell mate..... Unfortunately the system will probaby see the theif as the ""victim""."
758356,moxie,2013-01-11 16:40:00,1566,A real shame. Hope it works out.
758372,Live2fish85,2013-01-11 17:36:00,1633,Well they found the van. Just it is wrecked. They took it for a B&E the cops figure then wrecked it.
758374,Live2fish85,2013-01-11 17:39:00,1633,"Drifter, I wish that was the case."
758375,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 17:39:00,3525,"That sucks, at least they found it."
758376,fishnsled,2013-01-11 17:42:00,3520,  That just sucks!!  Hope they get the scumbags.  Amazing how low some people will go.
758479,spincast,2013-01-11 23:45:00,3279,Chris - cant use the words here to describe how much that p's me off - especially on top of all your health issues-  this is just unreal. Hopefully insurance will give you something to start over with.?
758493,Guest,2013-01-12 00:45:00,0,If I ran this country there would be some changes.  If caught stealing a car you are going to get a public lashing on your back.  That would scare them off.
758502,solopaddler,2013-01-12 01:26:00,8605,"That's horrible, you guys really need to move."
758510,Live2fish85,2013-01-12 01:53:00,1633,I said the same thing Mike. This is a half decent area to but not that decent I guess. I am thinking of moving to Grimsby or the west mountain. I am thinking more Grimsby though just farther for work.
758511,ehg,2013-01-12 02:19:00,2666,"Sorry to hear this. What a pain in the butt. Live in downtown T.O and this is sort of common here as well. Had vehicles stolen about 5 times in 80's and 90's. They were Dodge Caravans with child seats but didn't matter to thieves. Haven't had a theft for a dozen years or so though. Thinking it was because i lock my car with the Club steering lock always. Could be because there is many BMW's, Mercedes, etc parked near me so van doesn't look that desirable Luckily insurance covered me at time hopefully they help you. "
758524,Live2fish85,2013-01-12 03:04:00,1633,"Ehg, that is what we have lol. Well a plymouth voyager, piece of garbage lol. The cop said they are the most common to get stolen."
758540,Slop,2013-01-12 03:57:00,151,"So... they stole something expensive and personal to you, also your family's mode of transportation and destroying your belongings,other than that, they're just probably all around good guys....I digress."
