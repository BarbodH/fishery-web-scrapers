759074,Slayingm,2013-01-14 13:38:00,204,"Against my common sense and good judgement we headed back up to the Haliburton Highlands Friday to hit a multi-specie lake and enjoy the pouring rain and man did it come down all day! Thank goodness for quality portable Ice Shelter's and propane heater's as we were dry and warm (as long as we stayed inside). We did see another group of guys walk out and they maybe lasted 1 hr and headed in with soaked Floater suits.With the mega front moving thru the fish were in a very negative mood so light lines, small jig and minnow combinations and set lines with minnows were in order. Even with that we had a number of good fish that would rise up and traditional tricks to entice a strike mostly failed.. but not all! We setup on a 30  foot break off a flat in a attempt to intercept some fish transitioning from deep to and/or from shallower water.After a couple light hits on the jig one of the set lines w down and screaming line.. after a good battle a approx. 8lb Northern came to the hole but unfortunately cut the line just as we were going ice him... dang! Minutes later the same rod went off... after a solid hook set the battle was on!.. standing in the wind and pouring rain with numb hands are all forgotten as we see this beauty 38"" Laker peeling off line and getting a visual thrashing below our feet under the 5"" of black ice. After a great battle we iced the beauti Laker and quickly released her after a couple of quick pics. I forgot the scale but estimate the 38"" fish around the 15lb mark.Back into the shelter to warm up and continue to see some fish totally ignore various jig options other then a couple of light taps. Set line outside went off again and this time iced a nice eater Walleye. Gotta love it when your getting into Laker's, Northern's and Walleye all in the same spot!!lPacked up at 2pm and made the slow walk back to the truck in the slush and water on the ice and yup!... still pouring rain! Another day, another Adventure, another memory...Enjoy the video and remember to be safe out there!"
