758146,Lunker777,2013-01-10 21:01:00,866,I have a chance to pick up  a big red trike.  I have a couple questions regarding licencing these machines... I know they have been out-lawed ... And i thought you couldn't licence one with out being grandfathered into the machine ?? ( dad passes away and leaves you the machine... type of deal )  Whats the rules or what do I need to know if Im going to buy this thing ?  Its a 250 Honda big red Trike. ..... whats the value ??? average condition for the year I guess.  I want to get it for ice fishing possibly.  Thanks for any help
758156,davey buoy,2013-01-10 21:39:00,5505,"I know 30 years ago I bought a brand new Honda 200S Had it for 15 years,really regreted selling it to this day.Faster than the M and Big Red but a tad smaller than the M. At that time you could really not drive it anywhere. It was a always look over your shoulder and if the authorities showed up,just make the next exit lol..Having said that growing up north of Wasaga,there were tons of trails and the beach during the spring,.fall and winter..I used it ice fishing when I had a home at Big Bay Point. Never any issues than,even when the ministry or Police stopped at my hut to see what we were doing.Private property ok obviusly,just not sure nowadays."
758159,chris.brock,2013-01-10 21:41:00,4053,"As far as being outlawed, I'm pretty sure they just aren't allowed to produce and sell them anymore, but anything used and still around is the same as any 4 wheel ATV, I'd say if it's decent shape and runs/ sounds fine, $1200 to $1500 is market price   I found this surfing around  In the U.S. ""Manufacturing of the three-wheeler was banned in 1988, and when the decrees expired in 1998, manufacturers agreed to an ATV Action Plan in which they agreed not to market or sell three-wheeled ATVâ€™s"
758167,porkpie,2013-01-10 22:05:00,2521,"They aren't banned and you don't need to be grandfathered.  They are no longer made due to safety/liability reasons, although as mentioned there was a moratorium on manufacturing them."
758171,misfish,2013-01-10 22:10:00,29133,"You wont get insurance coverage for it,that I can tell you."
758173,Muskieman,2013-01-10 22:16:00,2472,"insurance will be impossible to find .. Isn't it law that a vehicle used on the ice must be ensured & plated .. I know that in the eyes of our "" by law "" here on West Nipissing they ( trikes ) are now allowed on the street like they allow a 4 wheeled ATV .. I used to have a Big Red 250s and a 185 , they can be very fun and very nasty .. I wouldn't pay more than 600$ regardless of its condition ..  Randy"
758174,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-10 22:17:00,10439, And if you can't get insurance you won't be able to plate it and drive on the roads because you won't be able to get it plated.

758179,misfish,2013-01-10 22:32:00,29133,"  Times have changed. I seen a ATC for a few hundred bucks. Running and in good shape. Called my insurance company,sorry,no can do."
758180,davey buoy,2013-01-10 22:35:00,5505,I don't think I could ever insure mine.
758190,gaspumper,2013-01-10 23:17:00,393,Prrimmum insured mine as a 3 wheel  motorcycle last time i had insurance on it.
758202,Fisherman,2013-01-11 00:00:00,7201,"Okay for all those that believe you can't get insurance or plate a 3 wheeler,  you can.  My oldest son has a Honda Big Red 3 wheeler, it's plated and insured.  I've seen the pink slip and registration.  We were stopped by OPP way up in the Temiscamingue area back in the fall,  he produced, they smiled and said have a nice day fellows,  careful hunting."
758219,NAW,2013-01-11 02:36:00,4022,Come on now Fisherman....  There's no good hunting in Temiscamingue
758241,Sinker,2013-01-11 03:22:00,8692,"Yep, they sure can be insured and plated. There is a guy around here who collects them. Its all he rides. I'll ask him where he gets his insurance from if you can't get it. Just PM me if you need to know!  S"
758283,Fisherman,2013-01-11 12:40:00,7201,"Hahahaha,  we were scouting for Sasquatches but figured if we spotted TJ, that might do to convince the skeptics."
758409,Uncle Buck,2013-01-11 19:14:00,1000,My Uncle had a Honda Big Red 250ES that thing rocked...  most fun of all the ATVs i've been on...
758412,davey buoy,2013-01-11 19:21:00,5505,"Thinkng back,mine was the most fun of all,beat snowmobiling and dirt biking,recreational of course.It was a year round machine.Jiggers were the only thing else and that was 6 wheels  ."
758417,Lunker777,2013-01-11 19:39:00,866,"hmmm... I guess I should just call the insurance company and find out what the deal is !  I saw TWO of them on the ice last saturday.... they would have to have insurance and licence to be out there ? I mean, that is if they were following the laws haha"
758427,Lunker777,2013-01-11 20:02:00,866,"Just called insurance company and my girl told me I could insure it for $70/yr ????  I asked her to be ABSOLUTLEY sure because she just kept asking me... "" its an atv right ?"" I said yes, but a THREE WHEELER.... she wasnt 100% sure so I told her to GET 100% sure and let me know.  Currently, waiting for a phone back"

758449,Muskieman,2013-01-11 21:04:00,2472,there you have it..  confusing a little... they say more than three wheels but yet show a photo of a three wheeler?
