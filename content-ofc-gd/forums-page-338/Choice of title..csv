My intent was to bring to light the issues facing the US engineers and the attitude to the great lakes.   First the issues with the carp and now the untreated sewage.  I am a firm believer that the barrier to Lake Michigan should be a sealed permant one.  If our freinds to the south still find this a tad distasteful, well we are all entitled to our opinions.

Right now with the change over it is a little hectic here and I don't need a distraction such as it was.  Thanks for your understanding and I have turned it back on with a different title.   Art
