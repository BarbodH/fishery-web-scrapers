756328,Jds63,2013-01-04 17:48:00,1365,"passed by it a few times ... never fished it, right in west guilford with easy access,  sorry can't help but i assume it must get fished a lot by locals"
756389,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 21:32:00,3525,"I fished it this October, didn't get anything. When you get there at the boat launch go right out of that bay, it's really, really shallow, nothing in that part."
756412,mukluk,2013-01-04 22:39:00,196,Fish it about 6 years ago in the summer. Only caught small bass. Have never seen anything on stocking lists about what was stocked in there.
756414,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 22:41:00,3525,"I should mention that although I didn't catch anything, my friend catches tonnes of bass with his son there from shore in the summer."
756533,fishindevil,2013-01-05 12:40:00,6254,There's walleye bass and pike perch and lake trout !!!!! It's easily accessible stay away from the bridge and the northeast section where the river comes in !!!!! The locals usually put their huts down the southeast side !!!! But the other lakes in the area are a better option like grass lake and maple !!! Both easily accessible I have fished them all for bass and walleyes !!!!
756570,sunfish1,2013-01-05 16:12:00,9, http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  go to stocked waters and pick walleye page 3

758649,fishboy,2013-01-12 18:19:00,550,guys please be reasonable & respectful on the harvest levels of these smaller lakes
758809,sunfish1,2013-01-13 04:36:00,9,mostly lakers and walleye
758838,fishindevil,2013-01-13 11:18:00,6254,"Just make sure you follow the regs and slots as the ministry does frequent those lakes as mentioned and I was there yesterday and be very aware if where you are as the current from the river that joins all those lakes is going pretty good and with all the melt it can be dicey just pay attention where the locals are or ask cause they know where to go on grass lake for years there is always a group of huts only a hundred yards or so from open water !!!!! They hae been fishin there for years ....and remember the saying ""if you don't know don't go"" and you will live another day !!!! I drove around Haliburton yesterday and there was lots of huts and guys out fishing but like I said mostly locals and the guys I talked to said just be aware and be careful some lakes looked a lot darker than others ..... FYI !!!!! And with all this rain things change quickly ??????"
758998,chris.brock,2013-01-14 00:42:00,4053,"for walleye, you're in a good chain of lakes, for lakers, you could do better elsewhere"
