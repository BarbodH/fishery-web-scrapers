758329,mistaredone,2013-01-11 14:55:00,913,I'm looking to rent a over night hut in Feb for 3-4 guys.    My first thought was Simcoe Perch but im easy on Location and Species.  Any recomendations?  All I have found so far is Luckys on Simcoe but he has a two day min on over night and only weekends.  Im probably looking a Sunday night fish  thanks
