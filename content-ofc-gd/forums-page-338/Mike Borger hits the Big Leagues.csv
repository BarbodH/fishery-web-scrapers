758413,ccmtcanada,2013-01-11 19:27:00,7971,Way to go Mike!  I'm going out in search of the magainze to take a read!
758420,fishnsled,2013-01-11 19:43:00,3520,"Congrats Mike!!   Will you autograph my copy??  Very sorry to hear about your uncle Mike, best wishes and thoughts sent his way and yours."
758454,esoxansteel,2013-01-11 21:32:00,1307,"Very nice Mike, and captivating, and im sure your story will no doubt send up some clients to the area."
758459,solopaddler,2013-01-11 22:01:00,8605,Wow thanks guys. I have to admit you're embarassing me a little bit though. I had a bittersweet visit with my uncle today and he had a chance to see it which was nice. The timing of this thing being published couldn't have been better.
758461,misfish,2013-01-11 22:19:00,29133,"Thats a bitter sweet pill to swallow Mike,, been there,and it will bring peace knowing.."
758462,solopaddler,2013-01-11 22:29:00,8605,"He's in palliative care at Sunnybrook, not in great shape. Still...An attractive nurse came into the room and insisted it was time to get cleaned up in the bathroom. And the old bugger smiled and winked at me when she turned her back. I have never known another human being who LOVED life like he did, and he could always make me laugh even now.  "
758729,MJL,2013-01-13 00:10:00,2427,Congrats Mike  Eagerly waiting to pick up a copy to read.  Best wishes for your uncle
758745,Jet,2013-01-13 00:40:00,364,"Your stories should have been published more long before this!  At least on the flipside, we've been able to read them for years for the first time right here!  Look forward to more articles from you Mike - A belated welcome to the writers club!"
758770,SirCranksalot,2013-01-13 01:39:00,3291,"Mike, Congrats---very well written indeed! Now we can all say we knew you before you became famous! The news about your uncle is quite sad, but you must know you did the right thing by taking him on that trip. I’d say that kid is hooked as well as any fish can be! I’m envious of that-----I couldn’t get my boys very interested in fishing. Then again, I didn’t take then to Dusey! As you know, Brad gave us a briefing on your trip before you had even flown back out. My fishing buddies were gung-ho at the time to go there this year but have now wimped out! (Maybe couldn’t get budget and/or vacation approval from their wives). I’m revved up again after reading your article. I think I’ll have to trade my fishing partners for a bunch of new ones for next year’s trip to Dusey. I’ll look forward to you next fly-in report-----“The Return of the Chrominator”!"
758866,fisherman7,2013-01-13 14:52:00,325,Read the article yesterday. Great reading as always. Well done!

757480,Fish Farmer,2013-01-08 13:41:00,2234,"Congrats Mike, should make some good read. Sorry to hear about your uncle but I'm sure he'll like to see the article, It'll make his day. I think I'll mention about your article at our next club meeting."
757492,torco,2013-01-08 14:25:00,656,"Congrats, I look forward to reading it.  Sorry to hear about your uncle."

757517,solopaddler,2013-01-08 17:14:00,8605,"Thanks everyone, much appreciated.    Some very kind words Roy, thank you.  And yes Brendan took a whole bunch of pic's on that trip including at least one, maybe two that were published. I never even thought of that!  Also I have to say this is far from ""the big leagues"", but it's pretty cool nonetheless."
757532,TJQ,2013-01-08 18:02:00,7806,I got mine... great job!!

Always good to hear peoples hard work paying off for them. And please, Keep em comin"
757645,solopaddler,2013-01-08 22:47:00,8605," Thanks for the kind words once again everyone!  I've been published before actually, but it's been many years since the last one. Much to the consternation of everyone close to me."
757652,chris.brock,2013-01-08 23:04:00,4053,"can't wait to read it, from reading your stuff here, no doubt you can write, just another step towards your new career as a full time, fishing celebrity!"

757741,rob v,2013-01-09 03:48:00,535,looking forward to reading your article - congrats !
757778,DanD,2013-01-09 13:54:00,2223,"Congratulations Mike well deserved. If it wasn’t for your reports here, my brother and I would have never gone on our fly-in tip this past summer. Fly-ins always seemed just out of our comfort zone, not knowing what to expect. After reading your report and then talking with you on the phone; we knew we were going as soon as my brother’s health would allow. Your writing puts out a real life account of your trip(s), not just the propaganda that most places write for themselves. Good luck on many more articles; but don’t forget your reports here, giving us a preview of them.  Dan. "
758052,Fish Farmer,2013-01-10 13:57:00,2234,"Just read your article Mike, Great read. Best part of your article was the last two sentences. Brings back memories."
758158,kickingfrog,2013-01-10 21:41:00,8333, Got mine on the 8th. Helped me get through the last few days when I could get on the site.
758163,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 21:56:00,3525,"Can't wait to pick one (or a few) up! And I'd appreciate an autograph as well  Sorry to hear about your uncle, hopefully he'll get a kick out of the article"
758197,aplumma,2013-01-10 23:46:00,6896,good Job mike I hope someone will send me a P.M. with the article so I can read it. I am sorry to hear about your Uncle though best wishes and prayers for him.   Art
758411,kemper,2013-01-11 19:20:00,2232,"Right on Mike, I guess I'll have to bring my signature book next time we share a drift..."
757425,Kingsalmon,2013-01-08 03:27:00,107,Congratulations Mike on what may be your first published article.  Here's to many more interesting articles about your incredible fishing trips.

757427,BillM,2013-01-08 03:39:00,17367,Still haven't gotten my Jan/Feb edition in the mail yet!
757431,kickingfrog,2013-01-08 03:50:00,8333," Same here, but I haven't looked at the mail today. Too many big bills this time of the year."
757432,Christopheraaron,2013-01-08 03:50:00,3525,Congrats mike! It's about time you get noticed
757434,solopaddler,2013-01-08 03:59:00,8605,"Hey thanks a lot guys, appreciate it!"
757435,kickingfrog,2013-01-08 04:05:00,8333,A short walk to the mail box produced squat. I hold Solo solely responsible.
757437,BillM,2013-01-08 04:07:00,17367," I just checked mine as well, lol!  Although it seems a bit early to be out, usually around the 15th I'll get mine."
757442,solopaddler,2013-01-08 04:55:00,8605,"Hey don't feel bad, I havn't even seen it myself yet. Guess it's time to subscribe.   On a somewhat related and more serious note my uncle who joined us on that trip is now in pallative care. It seems all but certain that particular trip will have been his last. He was the one who planted the angling bug in me over 40 years ago now and a true passion for brook trout as well.  He's always been proud of my accomplishments and I'm very glad he'll get the chance to see this story in print. I did make mention of him in the story as well, he'll get a kick out of that.  I'll be seeing him later this week to show him the magazine."
757444,BillM,2013-01-08 05:03:00,17367,"Sorry to hear about Horst Mike, I was hoping he'd take a turn for the better."
757445,jedimaster,2013-01-08 05:04:00,3472,Is it in ood I got mine today?

757448,jedimaster,2013-01-08 05:14:00,3472,Sorry I thought I should blank out the text for copyright reasons. Go support mike and go buy the magazine if you don't already subscribe. Great article btw. Just read it.
757449,solopaddler,2013-01-08 06:08:00,8605," Thanks Bill, it's been tough on everyone.     Hey from what I can see it looks great, thanks for the sneak peak!"
757450,TDunn,2013-01-08 06:39:00,680,Congrats Mike! I will definitely be reading that!  TDunn
757451,drwxr,2013-01-08 08:59:00,453,"well done, congrats    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh8iit10AAE  "
757452,spincast,2013-01-08 10:23:00,3279,"I look forward to reading that when my copy arives in the mail - Mike's stories are always entertaining and a source of one more item on the bucket lis. Sorry to hear about your uncle Mike, what a great memory for both of you"
757454,solopaddler,2013-01-08 10:54:00,8605,"Thanks lads!     Ah yes the video, that turned out pretty well I thought.  At first I was surprised when OOD asked for a video clip, but it's really a stroke of genius I think. It's the best way to show what a destination is truly like."
757455,Roy,2013-01-08 11:06:00,13728,"Congrats Mike!That was another of your many great trips. Who was the camera ""crew"" up there? Wasn't this the trip where Brendan had taken some pics as well?   Edited to add: And BTW, Mike has always been in the big leagues."
757462,Moosebunk,2013-01-08 12:34:00,3970,Nicely done Mikey!!!  Look forward to that read.   All the best for your uncle as well.  We'll talk soon.
757463,lew,2013-01-08 12:36:00,12766,"Atta boy Mike, well done & well deserved !!"
757467,craigdritchie,2013-01-08 12:45:00,1586,"Say Mike, if the outdoor writing gig doesn't pan out the way you want, you can always sideline as a real estate agent. That was quite the thorough cabin tour!  Joking aside, nice job on the video. I'm looking forward to reading the magazine once my mail man is done with it."
757468,Rod Caster,2013-01-08 12:54:00,5784,"That's great Mike.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here who had a ""feeling"" something like this would happen."
757473,NAW,2013-01-08 13:05:00,4022,Very nice to see!  Can't wait to read it.
