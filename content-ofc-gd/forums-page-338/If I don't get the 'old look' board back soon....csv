758463,Dave Bailey,2013-01-11 22:31:00,1641, How think do you sloshed I am?
758464,zamboniwaterboy,2013-01-11 22:33:00,126,I like it!
758481,bassfighter,2013-01-11 23:52:00,366,"I miss the original look, since it seemed more creative to have that color combo look,  than  the present blue and shades of blue look.  Others might mistaken ontariofishingcommunity.com for this other site http://www.ontariofishingforums.com/forum/.  I like the original color of Green and Taupe color combo. I have notice some  companies have the same original colors. http://www.cabelas.ca/retail_stores/  basspro.com http://www.basspro.com/  dicksporting.com has the same green http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/home/index.jsp"
758485,JoshS,2013-01-12 00:15:00,729,"Gotta say I liked the old look too but I'm sure changes are to come. Other than that the site upgrades look good, good job!!"
758486,Christopheraaron,2013-01-12 00:17:00,3525,"Ya, also...  http://www.niagarafishing.net/forums/ http://www.lakesimcoemessageboard.com/ http://www.ontariosportfishing.com/ http://forums.oodmag.com/forumdisplay.php?f=5 http://ontarioshorefishing.com/forum/ http://www.lakeontariounited.com/fishing/index.php  There are more too..."
758519,Skipper D,2013-01-12 02:40:00,1970,"All we need is the brass and wood , i think it would go good with the new colours ......"
758520,TJQ,2013-01-12 02:56:00,7806,Were working on it... a toned down one is coming this weekend... I promise!!
758534,Christopheraaron,2013-01-12 03:47:00,3525," Great news tj! I do like the new features, just not huge on the look..."
758602,Crazy Ivan,2013-01-12 14:41:00,184,I don't check this site as often as before. I prefer the old board much more.
758603,tbayboy,2013-01-12 14:44:00,1497,One thing I noticed missing (sorry if it's been mentioned) is that the old board remembered where in a thread I was and when I viewed it it started at my last read post. For example I read this last night and was on page 2. With the old board when I clicked on the thread title it would start at page 2 already scrolled down to where I was but the new one seems to have lost that (I always start at the beginning).  It's a great feature for long threads and it would be great if it came back.  Again - sorry if I missed someone mentioning this one already.
758608,nancur373,2013-01-12 15:09:00,1211,Not good on my Galaxy S III at all
758613,mercman,2013-01-12 15:20:00,7054,"copious quantities of bacon   I'm with Brian on this, but i don't drink"
758619,Rod Caster,2013-01-12 15:40:00,5784," If you click the blue circle on the right side of the thread title, it'll do just that"
758733,tbayboy,2013-01-13 00:17:00,1497, Ahh - thanks Rod Caster!
758741,kickingfrog,2013-01-13 00:31:00,8333,That helps me as well.
758757,Lunker Larry,2013-01-13 01:09:00,122,Clear and not busy....but it just doesn't look....finished
758769,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-13 01:35:00,3761,"I agree, hope to see the old look back"
758856,Dave Bailey,2013-01-13 14:19:00,1641,"This is still the best board, no matter what it looks like. I just think that the old look seemed more like a rustic old fishing lodge, nice wooden look to it."
758859,GlennB,2013-01-13 14:32:00,25,"I agree with you Dave 100%, although with the added eye strain a nap in the afternoon seems to work well"
758873,ketchenany,2013-01-13 15:23:00,3229,"To make it look a bit better - get rid of the grey type, make it black, typographically speaking. This will add a bit of colour to the screen. Just look at the type under and advertiser looks a lot more readable than members who post . . . I bang heads with some of the people I work with when the do a site and all the type is grey or revised out of black!"
758881,dhickey,2013-01-13 15:59:00,1038,The beer isnt helping think its time to hit the rum..
758918,TJQ,2013-01-13 18:24:00,7806,"UPDATE!!!  Thanks guys... were working on new skins and perhaps were gonna add another mobile version as well, so lots to choose from EVENTUALLY.  The person we have hired to do the skins for us .. has just come off a bout with the flu, a bad one I may ad, and they are behind in work, so things will get done, just not as fast as I would like them to.  but rest assured we are doing everything we can to get things back to whatever we consider ""normal"" around here.  We're getting stuff done by professionals, I would do the skin install, but I'd rather have someone do it that does this type of thing every day rather than me or Roy would could easily make a mistake.  So everyone is just gonna have to be patient.  Weve got a skin coming thats not identical to the old club skin, but as close as we could fine thats compatible with this new version of software.  So far I like some of the upgrades!"
758940,misfish,2013-01-13 19:29:00,29133,  GOOD CHOICE my friends.
758941,kickingfrog,2013-01-13 19:31:00,8333,Just like I am tellin' my 4 year old all the time.  Be patient.
758340,Dave Bailey,2013-01-11 15:48:00,1641,...I'm going to indulge in copious quantities of beer and bacon until this design looks like the old one to my eyes. Who's with me?
758341,misfish,2013-01-11 15:50:00,29133, Sounds like a plan.
758344,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 15:57:00,3525,I'm in.
758347,lew,2013-01-11 16:02:00,12766," I'm not a drinker, but a bacon samich would be nice  Roy assures us there's a fix in the works."
758363,Fisherman,2013-01-11 17:16:00,7201, It better not be Franks Hot Sauce with the old lady that put's it on everything.
758368,Bernie,2013-01-11 17:27:00,3190,"I'm with ya Dave. Hard to look at right now.  Hopefully we get something similar to the old ""Club"" style."
758369,BillM,2013-01-11 17:29:00,17367,"You guys complain more then a bunch of old ladies, lol."
758373,irishfield,2013-01-11 17:39:00,26272,Like most here need and excuse to follow the OP's lead!!! I gotta drive for 2 hours first!! LOL
758377,Squid,2013-01-11 17:52:00,1656,  Really?
758379,mr blizzard,2013-01-11 18:04:00,1589,"As mentioned before it is a little bright   but with the lack of sunlight up here the screen lights up the whole damn house Saves alot on hydro   don,t  need any lights on  .  You guys are doing a great job updating  and hopefully  the screen will tone down a bit with time  Cheers Blizz"
758382,Spiel,2013-01-11 18:09:00,9065,"Funny, the skin you guys are all missing was one I never used, couldn't stand it to be honest!"
758384,jedimaster,2013-01-11 18:13:00,3472,One thing I have learned after many years in the IT world is what works for the designer is often hated by the customers.   Is there any function to pick a different skin for the users or a theme or something?
758389,shane,2013-01-11 18:29:00,652,"THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY!!  Actually, after the first ten minutes or so, I got used to it. Really shows how dirty my monitor screen is tho'."
758391,kickingfrog,2013-01-11 18:33:00,8333,"Um, look at the OP's avatar."
758394,Rod Caster,2013-01-11 18:43:00,5784,"On my BB things are nearly unusable and unreadable. I'm considering starting a new fishing site using the old, discarded site  kidding, but seriously, its bad. No issues on my computer however, in fact I like it a lot"
758395,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 18:44:00,3525,LMAO!
758396,davey buoy,2013-01-11 18:49:00,5505,That's just Dave lol. Your not thinking it's too late.  .
758419,chris.brock,2013-01-11 19:43:00,4053,"I thought the new board might grow on me, but I'm still not diggin' it at all"
758423,davey buoy,2013-01-11 19:52:00,5505,It's on it's way. It must be the brightness against your eyes.I find myself constantly looking away for short times.
758429,misfish,2013-01-11 20:03:00,29133,"Beers are all gone,what next,,,,,,,,,,"
758431,blaque,2013-01-11 20:07:00,2419,Why dont you guys adjust the brightness on your monitor.   Most laptops you can change it with the fn key in conjunction with an f8 or other f key?  If you have a dinosaur monitor itll be one of those big ole buttons on the side lol  No sunglasses needed
758433,davey buoy,2013-01-11 20:12:00,5505,"We just like the old skin better,made it unique and was that much nicer and different from all the rest. If it doesn't change it's still the best site out there.IMO. We'll evolve lol."
758435,blaque,2013-01-11 20:15:00,2419," No i hear ya, i prefer the brown screen as well.......just in the meantime, you can dim the lights until then"
758443,misfish,2013-01-11 20:44:00,29133,"The one at work seems better then the one at home. I can see really good with the work pc,home one gives me a head ache."
