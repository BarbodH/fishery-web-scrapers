758718,MJL,2013-01-12 23:52:00,2427,"Maybe next time I’ll pack a 36” rod in the tube.LOL  Now I wanna see a 40lb Gerrard rainbow fit through that 8"" hole"
758739,Jet,2013-01-13 00:28:00,364,"Thanks everyone for sitting through my long video  The prehit fish finder action isn't as exciting with Bull Trout compared to the Laker chase - you just see a line for a split second and smash!  I've never hooked something so big in such shallow water, so having it dart in circles all around the hole while pulling a good 30-40 feet of line was a totally new experience for me.    Not a GoPro. I run a Panasonic TS2. I find the video quality is better and that's what I'm after. It's tough, however, trying to turn on the camera, hit record and set it for a proper viewing angle all while a fish is going bezerk! I've lost quite a few fish fumbling with the camera, but when I get clips like this it makes it all worthwhile. Vids do a lot more for me than pictures, especially when I watch them again after a year or two!"
758740,Jet,2013-01-13 00:29:00,364," I have been thinking of Gerrards, not sure Kootenay Lake freezes over though, but I'll look into it!  BTW, I like the new avatar. I know that spot!"
758751,limeyangler,2013-01-13 00:54:00,5204,"That there makes me want to call in sick to work!  When you pulled that through the ice i shouted out....""HOLY"".   Great catch. (u got braid on that reel?)"
758752,Leecher,2013-01-13 00:55:00,7832, Looks like mono to me
758755,Jet,2013-01-13 01:02:00,364," TJ knows his lines! Ya P-Line 8 lb.  I like to run braid, but unless it's warm or I'm in the hut all day I stick with mono."
758758,Leecher,2013-01-13 01:10:00,7832, Yeah and you should re-spool that reel before your next time out after this abuse
758263,Jet,2013-01-11 05:10:00,364,"With the ice taking its time to form for most of you, why not tease you all with some action that's happening out here in BC!   I got an early Xmas present from the Fishing Gods with the best fight I've had under the ice, besting the many big Lakers I've managed to pull up in Ontario.   Here's the spec: -28 inch MH ice rod -8lb test -Williams half/half -Just 12 feet of water!!!   Please ignore the commentary! I do these videos mostly to send back home to family and friends. This clip is just over 5 minutes, but there is rarely a dull moment during the whole fight with some massive drag pulls as it circled all around the hole.  PS: Thanks Simon for helping me with embedding the video with the new site!   Cheers!"
