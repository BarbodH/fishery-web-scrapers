756926,chris.brock,2013-01-06 20:51:00,4053,"My cottage buddy who usualy comes along on these day-trip adventures, wasn't around this weekend, so this was a solo mission.  I had stuff organized the night before, so I left the cottage fairly early, a beautiful winter morning, looking at North Pigeon Lake.      A quick stop at Minden Live Bait and Tackle for minnies, a quick chat with Jack and I'm on my way.    I've only fished this lake in the open water season, in a canoe. I got the impression not many people are fishing the lake because it's difficult to access. Hopefully, my long track Bravo will be the ticket to get me in to the lake in the winter.    To get to the lake, I would have to use canoe portages with the sled. Some creative riding was required. This pic is from the trip out. The sled slid off the portage. Lucky it's very light.    I made it to the lake, there was no sign that anyone had been to any of the lakes I crossed. Here, I set up the tip-ups across a neck-down area of the lake.    Nobody around    Over 10"" of ice, but plenty of slushy spots.    The bite was steady. I caught 5 on 8 bites in less than 2.5 hours of fishing. The smaller fish in the pic was the smallest I caught. Kept 1 for dinner and 1 for the freezer. At one point, the furthest tip-up from me went down and before I could get there, the base tipped over and the tip-up was pulled down the hole. I grabbed the other tip-up on the way by, and sent the minnow down the hole. The fish was still there. I hooked it, landed it and recovered the lost tip-up.  "

757002,Joeytier,2013-01-07 00:35:00,3990,Sweet!  I had a brookie take a tip up of mine down the hole back in early december.  Retrieved the tip up but not the fish
757028,chris.brock,2013-01-07 01:23:00,4053," yeah, they're perfect for stuff like this trip, I've always wanted one, and had to buy this one ""sight unseen"" when it came up, great for back country stuff   they were biting steady, it almost felt like I wanted a lull just to let my hands warm up and to relax and look around for awhile, can't complain though  glad you liked the pics, we both like to be away from the crowds"
757149,4x4bassin,2013-01-07 15:07:00,1025,"Love the back lake reports , nothing better then being away from the crowds !"
757158,NAW,2013-01-07 15:32:00,4022,"That's a great report man!!  Love the Bravos.  I have a short track, and it will go anywhere.  The long tracks are unstoppable!  Looks like it's in great shape too!  Congrets on the successful outing!"
757161,Freshtrax,2013-01-07 15:35:00,2215,Nice I was out in Dorset area from 7-12 on sat. Not even a bite.  Was nice to get out though
