I thought it might be good for everyone to dig up one of those old photos that is a favourite of yours and post it.  Might helps us get through this warm spell before the hard water sets up again.  There were a few but being the ice season I figured I post this one of a Simcoe trip with Headhunter and my buddy Ken from a few years ago.  Here's hoping we can get out there and do it again soon!
