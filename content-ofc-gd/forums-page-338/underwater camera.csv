I am looking for a fish style housing for the camera. the lense is only about a twoonie size and lenght is about 4"". i tried looking for a plastic fish like toy or a used housing from an old fishtv unit with no luck.  any ideas???  last i used a piece of plumblers pipe to house it but i didn't like the way it looked.   so just to give you a few details on what i used for those who are curious: used a car back up camera that i got from ebay $18(wide angle color and nightvisionalso waterproof)works great!! 9v battery from electronic store$12 CAT5 WIRE 120FT. $9 AND MY old 7"" portable dvd player witch has av input.  so again not to stray from my question is can anybody help finding a housing??  thanks"

758402,glen,2013-01-11 19:00:00,2641,I cant help you with the housing.  But very nice work on the camera.  Have you tried it underwater?  How does  it work?
758404,Uncle Buck,2013-01-11 19:07:00,1000,why not look for some plastic plants and camo it like that... would also create structure and might bring fish in also?
758623,zamboniwaterboy,2013-01-12 16:01:00,126,"If you get a fish the size you want then you can take a mould of it and cast a housing, http://www.alumilite.com/Applications/Taxidermy.cfm.  Here they cast a soft bluegill but you could make a hard body.  http://www.makelure.com/"

758872,batoathome,2013-01-13 15:14:00,47,Well I found a hard rubber fish in the baby section at Walmart . One of those bath toys. It works perfect . Just had to stuff it with 4 1 once fishing weights. Will take some pictures and post it later. Tested the camera up to 60ft works fantastic.
