758762,Nipfisher,2013-01-13 01:19:00,2449,"First off let me say that there was alot of ice still today. 9-11"" where we were fishing. That does not mean the ice is/was safe everywhere.  The first 200 yards out from the launch was covered with 4-6"" of standing water which was rippling with the wind. Beyond that the walk was slushy, slippery, and really wet.  Our holes from yesterday were still open and were now more then 10`in diameter. They wereÂ done with an 8"" auger. Holes under my hut were close to 20"" in diamater. Only a few fish today and the warm wind never let up.  Here are some pictures.        Here is a quick 360 degree view from my hut. The wind blows the wrist strap in the way.  "
758807,BillM,2013-01-13 04:29:00,17367,That looks sloppy.
758816,Joeytier,2013-01-13 05:56:00,3990,It's an awful mess on the back lakes right now.  Cold snap will lock up it and tight though.
758857,Nipfisher,2013-01-13 14:21:00,2449,Wasn't gonna go to the hut today but with the rain I better go check on it.
758935,Bernie,2013-01-13 19:20:00,3190,"Just got off the lake at Wades Landing.Lots of holes developing where the water is running down now. I didn't stop to check how thick it was but it's pretty soft. Glad it is supposed to cool off, a couple more days of this and I'd be boating in January."
758938,misfish,2013-01-13 19:25:00,29133,"Were those fish bonked or throut slit before they were left lying around.  Atleast your getting out Blair. Even at that thickness,soft ice is just that.  Take care out there bud."
758964,Rod Caster,2013-01-13 22:04:00,5784,"   There will be a lot of shacks frozen to the lake next week. It's setting up to be a fantastic lock-up of the lakes up here, as long as it doesn't snow heavily this coming week."
758965,Bernie,2013-01-13 22:10:00,3190, Yep. Seen a few sagged over today. Might be another year of stuff drifting into my shoreline after the ice melts in spring.
758970,misfish,2013-01-13 22:18:00,29133,  Yard sale stuff Bernie.
758991,Joeytier,2013-01-13 23:56:00,3990,"5-6 inches on Callander today...sinkholes everywhere, and some clown drove his truck out about a km off shore.  Couldn't believe it didn't go trough."
758994,Nipfisher,2013-01-14 00:12:00,2449,"Joey we were 9 - 10"" in all our holes. Alot less water on the lake today."
