905787,chessy,2015-03-24 18:00:00,610,the highest ganny run was 14000 fish we have never had 18000 fish run the ganny. the counter counts every fish exept 16 inch fish or smaller last year was 1.6 % of the trout run was under 16 inches .
905789,206,2015-03-24 18:13:00,563,"Updated pics this morn. Water is dirty, from foot bridge to boat lauch still solid. Guys are stacked deeper then the fish so far!!  Donny's Ice pick.   Parking lot west side.   open water Game on.   Still Ice fishing.   Get boats ready ramp is open, just can't get to lake yet. "
905943,ironstone74,2015-03-25 15:36:00,201,"Wow.  Some stubborn ice.  When it pops, looks out!!!"
904426,chessy,2015-03-18 16:56:00,610,As of today the west side of river is closed to all traffic including people the river blew out and its dangerouse  the town has closed it till further notice.. I have asked that the ice be pushed back in river once it clears the town is up in air over that .. so till the ice is gone there will be no access south of the viaduct on the west side of river 
904432,solopaddler,2015-03-18 17:22:00,8605,Wow that happened fast. Guys were ice fishing on 2 plus feet of ice in the harbour until recently.  Would love to see some pic's of what's going on if you're able to post them.  Thanks!
904435,lew,2015-03-18 17:28:00,12766,"Noon news showed the ice breaking up and their afraid it'll plug the river and flood over the banks the way it did 35 or so years back.  They've got some heavy equipment trying to break the jam up.  In case anyone doesn't know, the ""Float Your Fanny Down The Ganny"" is done every year to mark the anniversary of the flood."
904450,chessy,2015-03-18 18:08:00,610,Im going to take pictures this afternoon .. they have some big piles of ice on shore... and the river is clogged no where for the ice to go
904468,esoxansteel,2015-03-18 19:00:00,1307,"They might have do dynamite the ice wall between the piers to give the ice and flow somewhere to go, or theyll be in trouble as the water rises"
904481,206,2015-03-18 19:51:00,563,"They have had to scoop some ice from the river to keep it flowing, I'm sure if the river opens up you'll be able to wet a line around the piles lol      "
904486,Sinker,2015-03-18 19:58:00,8692,"It didn't blow out, they broke it up.  S."
904500,fishindevil,2015-03-18 20:29:00,6254,There is lots of pics on Facebook I seen it this morning '!!!! It was sure high .....
904544,chessy,2015-03-18 23:35:00,610,Sinker no it blew out.  I was at a meeting with grca when it happened. The town came in after the ice blew out down stram
904604,FloatnFly,2015-03-19 03:15:00,1640,"Warm weather, plus super thick ice, lots of snow, water levels would rose pretty quickly, and the force of that water would have been more than enough to break that ice up, but it clogged up like a toilet with half a roll of TP in it"
904701,Garnet,2015-03-19 18:07:00,2056,Port Hope still in danger.  From the low wall almost to the old Bi way is huge broken pack ice. One chunk is hitting the road bridge under tracks the rest about 3 feet away. The trench is solid. They have a Hi Hoe across from the boat launch breaking ice. Seems stupid to start there should be down at guard rail.  A big loader is moving the ice away from creek edge to the far side of the parking lot.
904782,FloatnFly,2015-03-19 23:27:00,1640,"its going to be an interesting situation down there over the next couple of weeks, especially if these cooler temps keep up.   makes ya wonder what it looks like above the dam"
904789,chessy,2015-03-19 23:51:00,610,The dam is solid. Basically from the file factory south let go.  They started up stream because they know they can not make ice go out. They started upstream so they can now break pieces small so they have less chance to jam back up. Ali the reason they moving ice way from bank as they have no room to work invade the rest of the river blowes   The town is very concerned over the next few days as even today was warmer than they did it was going to be
905044,msp,2015-03-21 01:00:00,1336,"I'm trying to make sense here........ Port Hope, Ganny, ice jam, hi hoe there ,breaking ice,town scared ! Oh oh ! Am I right ?"
905117,esoxansteel,2015-03-21 13:17:00,1307,"I'm trying to make sense here........ Port Hope, Ganny, ice jam, hi hoe there ,breaking ice,town scared ! Oh oh ! Am I right ?   Something like that, you forgot the part where the steelhead run is in full peak, with fish on redds, and then the town has the float your fanny down the ganny to honour a flood that was 35 years ago, which was  not the first big flood they have experienced by the way, and the fact that its illegal to disrupt fish during their spawning migration (according to the MNR and the regulations) this is the same town council that tried to get a roe ban on one river (The Ganny)"
905124,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-21 13:57:00,8243,"That looks like the Grand River south of York every few years. Had a bad one that flooded Dunnville a few years back, it did 500 thousand in improvements."
905170,Garnet,2015-03-21 19:17:00,2056,A dam up by Kendal blew out 35 years ago causing a 10 ft wall of water to hit Port Hope. The same spring rain took out the Van Stone dam in Bowmanville.  Also soured the river of any silt. Witch lead to the greatest steelheading ever. The late eighty's.  
905257,FloatnFly,2015-03-22 01:23:00,1640,"A dam up by Kendal blew out 35 years ago causing a 10 ft wall of water to hit Port Hope. The same spring rain took out the Van Stone dam in Bowmanville.  Also soured the river of any silt. Witch lead to the greatest steelheading ever. The late eighty's.    that was also due to the construction of the fish ladder that gave the fish access to much better spawning grounds, and reproduction numbers tripled.  the early 70s had runs similar to what we're seeing now.  the late 70's have runs above what we have now, the early 80's it spikes to around 15-20,000, and maxes out in the late 80s at 25000"
905325,chessy,2015-03-22 13:10:00,610,Those numbers are absolute bull crap. Those numbers are inflated so bad  what the counter counts that's the count  they counter counts everything Over 16 inches.  Last year 1.6percent were under 16 inches
905328,Garnet,2015-03-22 13:31:00,2056,It counted leaves too.  The flood did produce the best recruitment for a few years then the rivers silted back in. That's across the north shore.
905458,Richard S.,2015-03-22 23:11:00,75,"It has nothin to do with the river ""silting back in"". If you look at the angling trend you'll see right after 89 the steelheading boom took place. If you ask 90% of steelheaders out there when they started they will say the early 90's, it also coincided with Canadian Sport Fishing doing numerous steelheading episodes on G bay and Lake Ont tributaries. Not to mention that they we're naming specific tributaries and places they were fishing. A specific example is the ""S bends"", in the late 80's you'd see the same group of guys there. Then one day it went from 6 to 30 guys. When I started asking around to my surprise most said they herd it from a Canadian Sport Fishing episode that aired the day before.  Rich."
905472,Garnet,2015-03-22 23:45:00,2056,you are just wrong good steelheading is all about recruitment
905547,Richard S.,2015-03-23 14:36:00,75, Rich.
905566,Garnet,2015-03-23 16:36:00,2056,you no it happen you just have the wrong order by 87 the recruitment was falling and by 90 it was back to the 70's
905574,Richard S.,2015-03-23 17:46:00,75,"Right so you don't think that consecutive cold/wet summers plus stong year classes returning have nothing to do with it? Then how do you explain an increasing steelhead population since 2009? They increased because of cold/wet summers which created very little smolt die off which intern created strong year classes when those fish returned in 3 years.  Your also semi right on your years, the returning population fell a bit in 87 but peaked in 89 to a all time high at around 18,000 and steadly fell to an all time low in 2000. If you look at the harvest rates over those years you will see why the population fell, because it couldn't sustain itself with such a high harvest rate(5 fish limit) along with other contributing factors.  Rich."
