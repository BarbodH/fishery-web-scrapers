So I thought what the heck,lets whip one up and see how my first,smitty to go, would handle.( step one of many) It,s nothing like my first creation. I  made it simple. Simple is best some times.  Conditions were ice and slush with pressure cracks to go over. I again, made this smitty for the walker,but also added some support for pulling behind a machine if need be. No tow bar,just some rope spaced out over 28"". I knew there would be no snow to worry about,so made the skis slim. I used hockey board, which I ripped down to 1.5 "" wide. It slid on the ice and pavement with ease, loaded with all my gear.  We towed it probly 5-7 km, and it survived just fine. Bit of paint rash,but it was just brushed on the day before for looks.          Slides right in the back box  with ease.    Nice perchie buddy    Looks like a couple more weeks of perch,n, if work don,t get in the way."

I'm going out Saturday, not sure where though.   Some of the cracks are starting to make my   pucker a little bit."
906213,Terry,2015-03-27 01:53:00,14456,yes you should know that spot...lol I too will be out saturday   it worked well Brian

It,s got to be made so it breaks down for those that have small cars. Looks good B.  The breaking down is an awesome idea. I wish you luck with it. I'm sure lot's of apartment dwellers with limited storage space will appreciate that feature as well.  Just make sure it's easy to break down in the cold....or people will use it once....get frustrated....and curse you forever...lol."
906300,kenzy31,2015-03-27 14:03:00,261,Nice little rig  Are you thinking of a production run of some sort?
906310,Acountdeleted,2015-03-27 14:41:00,2562,Very nice. It's looking pretty sweet. Between your first one and my snowshoes I wonder how I ever got by without this before. Life is so much easier now. (At least with ice fishing)
