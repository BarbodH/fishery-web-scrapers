Still a good 3' of clear ice, almost no snow left.  Jack and myself headed down to get some fresh air, wet a line and walk the dog after school last night, he even tried skating, the ice is a bit rough though.  The bite was on, but everything was really, really small. Catch and release evening, but a lot of fun catching plenty and goofing around.  When I get to do stuff like this and watch my boy loving it just as much as I do it just doesn't get any better as far as I'm concerned. Who knows what tomorrow brings, live for today and enjoy the momentâ€¦.  Life is good.       TOOK THE SHACK OFF A WEEK AGO               RETURNED TO THE VACANT LOT               DID SOME FISHING               SKATED ABOUT                  AND GAVE ROLOFF A RUN                 HERE IS SOME VIDEO  "
