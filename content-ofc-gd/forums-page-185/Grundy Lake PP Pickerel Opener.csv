906541,GrandRiverWill,2015-03-28 14:00:00,3,Hey some friends and myself are headed up to Grundy Lake PP for walleye/pike opener. We are going to be staying on Gurd Lake.  I am just wondering what to expect for spring walleye and also if anyone has been fishing on Pakeshkag Lake.  I'd love to hear your stories.  Cheers

I don't remember seeing a walleye around....but lots and lots of pike...with a few bass...and we fished hard for the week we were up there...the three years we went.  I remember the one year I brought up a bunch of riverside 3"" white grubs (the rage for walleye in 1992, lol). .... I proceeded to lose every one to pike, getting bit off...so many pike."
