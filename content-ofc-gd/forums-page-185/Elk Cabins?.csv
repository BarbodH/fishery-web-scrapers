I've tried calling them but their voicemail is full; I've sent them a couple emails and haven't received a reply? I've even called the variety store and the town hall, (small village everyone knows everyone) in Elk Lake. They said they haven't seen the the owners since early winter? The town hall clerk said that if they have closed for business; they haven't notified them? This would have or hopefully will be our third year going there; place suits the needs of my ill brother, by not going off the grid; like we use too.  Dan."
