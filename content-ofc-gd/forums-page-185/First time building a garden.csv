904309,icefisherman,2015-03-18 03:28:00,952,"Make yourself raised bed...fill it in with sheep compost. Dig it up/mix it with your regular soil well...brake it in small pieces. Build yourself a tunnel...cover it with plastic sheets. Plant immediately (you are about 2-3 weeks late) indoors tomato seeds. Best tomatoes I recommend are the pink brandywine type. Sometime in April start taking them out couple hours per day first and slowly increase so they get used to the temps and sun outside. By end of April plant outside in the tunnel. That way you beet the short Canadian growing season by about a month. You'll need that month in the fall. About that time buy and plant indoor cucumber seeds (dill pickles are the best)...they'll be ready to plant outside by mid May to May 20th. Make sure you have plenty of sun....water regularly....keep weeds out...clean out tomato plants by braking of the pieces that grow between the main trunk and the leaves. You can go buy seedlings from hot pepper (Ghost pepper is what I recommend if you like hot). In the fall before ground freezes buy local grown garlic and plant it....leave it in the ground over winter....next year in July you'll have perfect garlic...recommend Melody brand....make sure you buy from green houses some parsley, celery, basil seedlings and plant them as well around May 24 weekend. If you do all of the above every year you'd love the hoby and start eating some top quality vegitables and herbs not the garbage that is sold in the stores.

904623,Garnet,2015-03-19 11:17:00,2056,Stagger your planting of beans. Say 3 meals meal in 1 week. So maybe 8-10 plants and then plant the next time about 10 days later. Same with carrots do 2nd planting about 2 weeks after first.  Then when your beans are done plant carrots. You can cover with 2 feet of straw before frost and go out all winter for fresh carrots. And they are the best tasting carrots. In the spring you just till the straw into soil.  Leaf lettuce same thing plant small amounts ounce a week.

The park does not allow you to dig up a portion of your lot for a garden; which is another reason to make it portable. So I collected some material and welded up this wagon frame; last weekend.      I still need to make the draw/steering bar and finish welding in the braces; but I ran out of argon for the mig welder, on Sunday. Then I'll need to make a 12"" high wooden box to fit the frame, that I plan on filling with about 8"" of a topsoil and compost mix. After that it should be ready for these little guys.      It surprised the heck out of me, how fast the lettuce, onion sets and beans sprouted and started shooting up; only after one week of being seeded. I may end up transplanting them to the bed, sooner than planned on? I'll just have to make room here in the shop; until it gets warm enough to stick outside.  Dan.  "

The yard doesn't get enough sun so I gotta move them around to chase the sun. Please let me know as the summer wears on if this works for you. I had a couple of times  where I never made it to the cottage so my plants went unwatered for 2 weeks. They all dried up and died. Unless you go every weekend I suggest you recruit someone to give them a drink when your not there.  Also your way to early for beans and they do much better direct seeded as opposed to starting seedlings. Direct seed Victoria weekend. Or have an option to cover them if you try earlier seeding.

Start another new bed. Dig up some of the root, and start in anther well fertilized trench. It takes about 3 years before you see any real result, but the old bed will have also been given a little natural kick in the meantime as it grows to recover from what you disturbed.  Thank you.  I've no idea how old this bed (it's actually a row in the garden) is or how to guesstimate its age.  I guess the best plan would be to fertilize and see how it compares to last, then in the fall decide to start a new bed?"

903726,Bluegill,2015-03-15 13:48:00,197,"A growers tip for tomatoes. If you want sturdy healthy plants you have to plant them deep. Buy a taller plant. Does not matter if it is a little spindly. When you dig your hole, depth of pot is too shallow. Bury the plant right up to the first branch. That entire section of stem will sprout root, making for a sturdier, healthier, heat tolerant plant.

904060,smitty55,2015-03-17 02:26:00,928,"Here's my advice.  When you start your bed, double dig it if your soil depth allows. This will set you up for a long time. Basically it involves digging down a shovel depth and then after setting that aside dig down another shovel depth, break it up and amend it with compost or other organic matter and nutrients, then backfill with what you originally dug up and amend. This gives much more nice soil for the root to grow into as well as giving better drainage for years. Or build a raised bed to get soil depth like bigugli recommended. I had to. I'm in Lanark lol. We grow good rock. I built 20"" high boxes.  If you can stay organic with your fertilizing, so much the better. Compost is your gardens best friend, It's the best thing you can feed your garden as it's full of organic matter and all the friendly bacteria that you need to feed the soil. ""Feed your soil and it feeds your plants"" should be your mantra. Hardwood ashes, lime, bone and blood meal etc are the way to go along with your organic. Chemical based ferts are a downward spiral as they kill all the natural bacteria that make up a healthy soil and cause the build up a salt deposits. If you can make your own compost piles so much the better. Also check out compost tea, specially the aerated ones you make yourself, which can really give your plants a boost. This is a good site to start with. http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/organic-fertilizers?page=0,1  Rotate your crops. Specially important with certain ones like tomatoes et al. Planting legumes like beans is great for your soil, as they fix nitrogen in the soil and make it available for your next crop.  Companion planting was mentioned. That's good for sure to learn, but just as important is what not to plant together, like carrots and dill for example.  Don't forget repellent flowers like marigolds and nasturtiums to keeps bad insects like aphids away. Herbs can also be excellent for this as well as giving you a steady harvest. Nothing beats cutting some fresh herbs from your garden for cooking.  Lime is great for adjusting your ph. Many soils need it and if you add any peat moss to your beds you should add it as ph is quite important. Things may grow, but not as good as they could.  Are you a garlic fan? I really love my garlic. Use a lot lol. I haven't bought any from a store since I started growing my own over a dozen years ago. There is absolutely no comparison in the quality and taste of home grown garlic compared to the grocery store cheap, lousy, crappy stuff from China. yecchh!! Here's the good news!! It's simple to grow, gives you a 400% return on your investment in the first year, and you get to replant your own garlic every year for free. And by going to any farmers market or garlic fest in July you can have the choice of 15-20 different varieties, depending on your taste preferences. Can't beat that IMO. I plant hard neck porcelain type, which keeps until May for me, and also produce ""scapes"", which must be removed mid season. This is an added bonus, as they are great eating in many ways. I plant 150 garlic cloves in November. 3 inches deep, pointy end up hehe. I then mulch heavily with dead leaves. In July I get 150 bulbs of varying size, depending on the size of the clove. Plant 6 inches apart. That takes a 4'x12' bed. So if you only want to have 50 plants you only need a 4'x4' bed. Can't beat that. It's actually my most valued harvest. It raises the quality standard of anything I use it with, including my pickles and sausages.  Hope this helps. Even my garlic spiel hehe. I just started with the double dig and then I couldn't just stop there lol. I just happened to notice your thread. Gardening is good for mind, body and soul in so many ways, including the work and maintenance. You'll enjoy it.  Cheers"

904099,Big Cliff,2015-03-17 12:23:00,6899,"Over the years I have had many gardens, everything from 50 X 200’ when I lived in French River which with canning and freezing helped keep our food cost down, to where I am today.  I learned a lot of things over the years but some of the key points were; potatoes and carrots take up a lot of space for the value you get from them, the work and space required to grow and harvest 50 pounds of potatoes which you can go and buy for about $15.00 isn’t good value. That said however as others have mentioned don’t do it to save money, do it for the pleasure it gives you.  I am now down to a little asparagus patch 2’ X 14’ a horseradish patch 2’ X 8’ and a mint patch of about the same (nothing better than homemade mint sauce with lamb or venison) and a few small pots of herbs. The asparagus patch is about 8 years old now but healthy as ever, I over seed it each spring with a package of fresh seed and add about 2” of new compost and that little patch produces way more than we can eat, I usually end up pickling some, freezing some, and giving the rest to neighbors.  Unless you are willing to can or freeze stuff don’t plant much of any one thing unless you are willing to stager the start times of different batches. If you don’t you’ll have bunches of the same thing ready all at the same time. A nice handful of fresh beans are great but when you end up with ½ a bushel all ready to be harvested at the same time you are either going to be giving them away or preserving them.  I never use any chemical fertilizers for any of my vegetables, we compost everything we can; all our food waste (excluding meat and bones)leaves, and best of all even weeds from the lake (let them dry before you compost them though). I get probably close to ½ a yard of really good compost for free every year just from doing that (mostly from the lake weeds)."

That way you put down the desired siol with worrying about existing soil composition, and drainage does not become an issue. With clay soils, it takes more than a year to properly blend and ameliorate the soil. One big disadvantage is people put in too much peat and manure creating a huge mud bowl with nowhere for the water to drain. The further north you go, the less you can grow unless you get into creative cheating. We've got our first tomato seeds sown on the grow bench."

This way that area is taken up with edible carrots instead of pesty weeds.  BTW those carrots will store very well in the ground up until the ground freezes so even when everything else has been pulled at the end of the year those carrots should be left in until you need them.
903207,turtle,2015-03-13 10:40:00,274,"The first year could be trial and error.  You'll find out what does better in your garden and what doesn't.  Sometimes year to year different plants seem to thrive while others don't.  Every fall I put down manure, if you know a farmer composted cow manure, and leaves on the bed and let it all rot and break down over the winter.  The beds should be rich dark earth with lots of worms.  May take a few seasons to get there.  Sunlight is a key factor for some plants like tomatos.  Look into companion planting, some plants do better together, and rotate the locations every year.  I don't use any chemicals and do OK with most plants."

One that'll have the strength to chew through anything, short of rocks. Get all the compost (whatever you decide to use) spread it out on the plot; right on top of the lawn, weeds whatever. Then rototill the whole mess together; getting as deep as the tiller will go, 12 inches would be ideal. While talking rototillers, I would also look into getting a small one; that will fit in between the rows. They're great for weed control and it will aerate the soil, allowing your plant's roots to easily spread. Even those $200.00 electrics that Cappy sells; believe me, it'll be your best friend out there.  Dan. "
903221,ckewley,2015-03-13 12:04:00,699,"It does depend on locale & plants but a good measure is May 24 weekend, before that there is risk of frost at any given time. I grow chili peppers, start them inside & move them outside. Lately I've been stuck to container growing with no yard but can still grow monster plants."
903241,chris.brock,2015-03-13 12:55:00,4053,"  I've had good results with tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers and hot peppers. I can't seem to do well with sweet bell peppers. Pumpkins will creep and spread all over the place."
903261,Raf,2015-03-13 13:38:00,3495,"I like the sounds of the carrot over weeds trick.  We're VERY amateurs about this, this will be our 3rd attempt this year.  We have tomatoes, beans, peas, asparagus (yes, asparagus we inherited those when we bought this place and I've no idea what to do about them this spring to ensure they keep coming up healtyh) and strawberries and have tried peppers.  I've found weeds the biggest enemy.  You'll spend a lot of time weeding.  It can be a lot of work."
903272,Headhunter,2015-03-13 14:34:00,5703,I highly recommend Sheep manure over cow for gardens. HH
903273,DanD,2015-03-13 14:34:00,2223,"Strawberries!!!!!!!!! Gotta love having them in your garden. Depending how many seasons they've been in; you should dig them out and separate the smaller plants from the mother plant. Toss Mom or turn her into mulch and replant the kids; if you don't do this, after the 3rd or 4th season the plant will go wild and the berries will become smaller and smaller. The first season with the fresh plants won't produce as many berries; but the 2nd and 3rd season you won't know what to do with all of them. We use to have a couple acres of berries; that we'd sell to the local country store. It was mom's job to pick them and she'd put the money away to buy that next year's Xmas presents, for all her grandkids. Those brats got some real nice stuff. LOL  Dan."

Another dear old dad gardening tip.........the best time to weed your garden is right after a good rain. They come right out with no effort at all. But watch out for all those carrots you just planted"
903282,Blue Lk,2015-03-13 15:18:00,337,"Just a little tip if you are using ""farm manure"",instead of mixing it straight into your soil,make a tea by adding water to a container partially filled with manure. Use the tea to fertilize. Using this method will cut down on the weeds & clover seeds. I have access to lots of very well aged horse manure,GF currently has 3 of these big yard ornaments (horses) & there have been horses on the property for 15+yrs. Even the stuff from the oldest piles still contain lots of clover."

903297,bigugli,2015-03-13 16:10:00,6138," Hot peppers, once the plants are established, can handle cooler night temperatures than sweet bells. Bells thrive on heat for fast fruit growth. No pepper like cool soil temps below 60F when planted out in spring."
903300,bigugli,2015-03-13 16:16:00,6138,"  Asparagus, is a perennial root best worked on in the fall. On the existing bed, a generous manuring is good, but the bed will grow old, less productive. Start another new bed. Dig up some of the root, and start in anther well fertilized trench. It takes about 3 years before you see any  real result, but the old bed will have also been given a little natural kick in the meantime as it grows to recover from what you disturbed."
903302,bigugli,2015-03-13 16:19:00,6138,  But not if the plants you have are shallow rooted. You risk popping the plant if the weed is close beside and its root ball underneath.
903303,bigugli,2015-03-13 16:23:00,6138,"A growers tip for tomatoes. If you want sturdy healthy plants you have to plant them deep. Buy a taller plant. Does not matter if it is a little spindly. When you dig your hole, depth of pot is too shallow. Bury the plant right up to the first branch. That entire section of stem will sprout root, making for a sturdier, healthier, heat tolerant plant."
903307,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-13 16:26:00,2582,"My dad's garden was 40 X 200. I grew up helping with that.  When I got a house I wanted a garden as well. I would suggest you read up on the subject. After one winter of reading I knew more about gardening then what my father ever taught me. He wasn't afraid to work he just never had the knowledge to do things right.  My favourite gardening book is Garden Ways ""Joy of Gardening"" by Dick Raymond. Walks you through everything and I mean everything you could run into vegetable gardening. Well written and enjoyable to read. I would suggest you start with that or any helpful book you might find. It will guide you through a whole lot of wasted time and energy and help to give you a clear plan.  If you get into it this summer and have any specific questions feel free to shoot me a PM. I have grown more different vegetables then I am willing to type out here and I'd be glad to help out with advice if I can.  Edited to add. Gardening is like fishing or hunting. Do it because you enjoy it. Don't for a second think a little back yard garden is saving you any money. I've had a 20 X 34 garden in my back yard since the 80's. It's a bit of exercise and something I enjoy. But after really keeping an eye on ALL my costs involved I can say with 100% certainty that cost wise I would have been further ahead to just head to the grocery store."

After doing this for MANY MANY years I have never uprooted a veggie plant while doing this. I was just trying to help the lad with time old proven tips from my dad but for some reason you seem to target everything I post.
903310,KLINKER,2015-03-13 16:37:00,256,"Don't do it! If you must ,put  a raspberry bush in the lawn and a few asparagus roots along the side somewhere. Go fishing and buy your vegies from a roadside stand on the way home.  Don't ever put cow manure in a garden. Risk of Ecoli."
