905759,Billy - Curtiss,2015-03-24 14:33:00,241,"Does anybody know if the one fish per day limit applies in aggregate?  If there are two anglers fishing for Auroras and one is caught, does the 'stop fishing for the day' mean both anglers must stop or can the other angler who has yet to catch one continue targeting them on that same day until a second is caught?"
905762,BillM,2015-03-24 14:44:00,17367,"As I see it, once you catch your fish, you're done for the day.  Your buddy can still fish until he catches his."
905766,Terry,2015-03-24 16:25:00,14456,you quit and your buddy fishes till he gets one
905786,irishfield,2015-03-24 17:56:00,26272,If it wasn't that way we'd always watch Lloyd carrying the fish home.. oh wait... we do anyhow..
905792,dave524,2015-03-24 18:22:00,4508,"Didn't they come to the conclusion that they are genetically indistinguishable from Brook Trout, hard to have special regs for a species that technically doesn't exist."
905860,Billy - Curtiss,2015-03-25 00:00:00,241,"http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=C0F414D2-1  ""Qadri (1968) observed differences between aurora trout and brook trout in skeletal structure; in particular, the number of trunk vertebrate, the number of ribs with strongly bifid heads, the number of single neural spines and the total number of epineurals.  There are also some morphometric differences, including the length of the maxillary.'  Are these not genetic differences?"
905863,FloatnFly,2015-03-25 00:11:00,1640,"Aurora trout are colour variation from brook trout, they lack the red spots as well as the worm like markings along the back.  they were originally only found in 2 lakes in the world, both of them in Ontario"
905870,dave524,2015-03-25 00:36:00,4508,""" In 2011, the Aurora Trout was determined by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) to be ineligible for assessment as it did not satisfy the discreteness and significance criteria that would justify its recognition as a designatable unit within Brook Trout. Similarly, it is no longer considered eligible to be designated as a species of risk under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007 (2011). Reassessment of the species’ status under the federal Species at Risk Act is currently underway. ""  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/species-especes/auroratrout-ombleaurora-eng.htm  it's status as an endangered species looks to be at risk, does anyone know anything more recent than this info."
905891,Nipfisher,2015-03-25 04:38:00,2449,TJ is the Aurora guru. Hopefully he will chime in. (Maybe we should post it in the Maple Syrup thread?)
905894,Billy - Curtiss,2015-03-25 09:37:00,241,Thanks for that link.  That is unfortunate.  It would suck to see over 50 years worth of effort to preserve their uniqueness all for naught.
905895,Joeytier,2015-03-25 10:00:00,3990,"Whitepine and Whirlgig will remain 100% closed I'm sure regardless, and all the other lakes are just stockers anyway."
905915,Rod Caster,2015-03-25 12:28:00,5784,"There was apparently a third lake nearby to Whirligig and Whitepine, but it got killed by acid rain from the Sudbury smoke stack. They almost lost everything due to that stinktown."
