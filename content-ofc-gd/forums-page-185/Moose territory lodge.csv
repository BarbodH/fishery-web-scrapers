905502,jnic,2015-03-23 02:04:00,158,Anyone have any info on this outfitter. Looking to book a trip at bapatie lake one of their outposts. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
905697,chris.brock,2015-03-24 01:59:00,4053,"Never heard of the place. I checked out the website.   I've tried to research places in Quebec, it's tough. Frustrating too because I bet there's some cool places I would like to go but I can't get the info.  We need Adam to do Quebec Outpost Directory.  Just curious, how did you hear about this place?"
905702,solopaddler,2015-03-24 02:19:00,8605,I fished it and did very well! Also directed dOUG on the board (what happened to him???) to this outfitter and his group went twice I believe.  Best thing to do is call me direct to discuss. (contact info is on my website)
