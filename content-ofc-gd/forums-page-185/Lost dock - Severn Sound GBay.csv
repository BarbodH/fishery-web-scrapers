905768,Cast-Away,2015-03-24 16:57:00,790,"Jezz, lucky that nobody on a sled ran into that dock in the winter time."
905771,lew,2015-03-24 17:03:00,12766,"Maybe I'm wrong, but I've always thought docks should somehow be licensed so in a case just like this the owner could be held responsible for not properly securing it or removing it from the water before freeze.  That huge dock is gonna be floating around GBay for awhile unless someone drags it to shore, or some poor schmuk is gonna be running down the lake in a month or 2 and hammer that thing and maybe kill himself."
905780,Big Cliff,2015-03-24 17:40:00,6899,"Might not be a bad idea Lew but to be honest with you I'll bet the owner of that dock would be really happy to have not lost it in the first place. My dock was only 30' long by 5' wide, it is going to cost me close to $2500.00 to replace it by the time I get done with buying the materials and I'll do all the labour myself.  In the 15 years we have been living here we have never had a problem leaving the dock in until freeze up. It makes life so eazy when you can just walk out onto the ice, pick up the panels and frame and carry them back to shore. This year the ice formed early then broke up, a bad shift in the wind and there it was, gone and all smashed to pieces.  It wouldn't have made any differance if my dock was licensed or not (oh and BTW that was another tax that has already been proposed) when you own one the last thing you want to have to do is replace it never mind about having to pay a license fee and a fine on top of the cost."
905783,irishfield,2015-03-24 17:51:00,26272,Zoom on the picture.. it's well marked with 4 ' reflectors and a ladder folded upright.
905784,irishfield,2015-03-24 17:55:00,26272,"4 X 4.. send me a PM with your email address, I took shots from North and South of the 5th right down to the dead end at the park. Then you can narrow it down for me and I'll get a better shot closer in the next time around."
905785,lew,2015-03-24 17:56:00,12766,"I hear ya Cliff, but IMHO it's up to whoever owns a dock to be absolutely 100% sure it's secured so it doesn't break free or else get it up on the beach.  I know a person who's dock broke loose when the ice went out and he couldn't have cared less, he just built a new one. A month  later I found his dock 1/2 way down the lake in a back bay.  I told him where his dock was and he said as long as HE didn't smash into it, it made no difference to him if anybody else hit it or not."
905796,Freshtrax,2015-03-24 18:27:00,2215,Lucky could have killed someone on a sled. ...
905806,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-24 19:14:00,956,Sweet pics Irishfield.  I grew up fishing on Little Lake near Port Severn.  Fish there probably 10 times a year and it was cool seeing it from the air.  Thanks
905896,Mister G,2015-03-25 10:14:00,1429," Yup, that's why mine is up on shore. It's a pain taking it out and putting it in every year but I have too much $$$$ invested to have it destroyed by the ice.   Looks like you have the  right conditions to put that main dock on hinges anchored to the shoreline rock. Then just crank it  up for the winter."
905897,Mister G,2015-03-25 10:15:00,1429,"Might not be a bad idea Lew but to be honest with you I'll bet the owner of that dock would be really happy to have not lost it in the first place.

I agree. The last thing we need is more taxes, fees or licenses."

905625,irishfield,2015-03-23 22:29:00,26272,"If you know anyone in the Moore Point.. Quarry Island.. Green Island.. Port McNicol area that is missing a nice L dock, it's out locked in the ice at the entrance to the long marked channel through the Green Island chain to get to Port Severn. In the main bay.. between Snake Island and the channel, but after the yellow/black caution marker!  Also note it will be close for Pike opener... No signs of ice letting go even after the week of +9C temps on the main lake or through the Port Severn system."

905631,Raf,2015-03-23 22:33:00,3495,ice is propably at or near its thickest right about now or a week or two ago.. it may hang on for a while but i've learned that it can go just as quick in the right (wrong?) conditions out there.
905632,irishfield,2015-03-23 22:34:00,26272,For sure Raf... -C every night for the next 14 days in the forecast.

905642,kickingfrog,2015-03-23 22:47:00,8333,That's somewhat identifiable from google earth no? If it was in place when the current photos where taken.
905645,kickingfrog,2015-03-23 22:50:00,8333,Found a couple of possibilities in just a few minutes. Hope they get it back for their sake and for the other boaters.
905647,irishfield,2015-03-23 22:53:00,26272,I'm sure many have eyes on it already... about 10 grand of dock there..
905650,BillM,2015-03-23 23:07:00,17367,Free dock! lol
905655,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-23 23:22:00,10439,Can ya fly it up to me? Could use more dock space.
905659,4x4bassin,2015-03-23 23:55:00,1025,"Thanks for the updates Irish , look forward to these pics. every spring ! Bit of $$$ sitting there in that dock , someone will be looking for it ."
905662,Joey,2015-03-24 00:14:00,9122,"Cool shot.  Hope they find it before going to the cottage for a ""where's my dock"" surprise soon"
905674,bigugli,2015-03-24 01:01:00,6138,Happens every year throughout cottage country. You leave your dock out and you risk it drifting out with the ice or getting crushed.
905676,myot,2015-03-24 01:11:00,131,That dock is a total shame I've been right up to it in person and several yahoo's have decided to run over it with their studded sleds ripping it to shreds (it will need a whole new top)  Dan

905687,bigugli,2015-03-24 01:39:00,6138,"  I used to be first into the water every year after ice out to get our docks in place and still wading in November when we pulled the docks out. The one uncle had a ""permanent"" dock set on a rock crib. Lord knows how many times we rebuilt that dock after the ice crushed it into kindling."
905691,Steelheadphycho,2015-03-24 01:41:00,470, X2!  I hope the yahoos get there just deserts........ Why do people have to be jerks?

The one uncle had a ""permanent"" dock set on a rock crib. Lord knows how many times we rebuilt that dock after the ice crushed it into kindling.  I only built it last summer so I don't want it ground into powder before I get some use out of it. It looks like the guy across from me left his in. He built it last summer also. Our ice gets to be 5' thick, once the shoreline goes that big chunk of ice can do a ton of damage. I have my dock pulled up on the rocks and chained to forged eye bolts anchored into the granite. Want to make sure the dock doesn't get carried off. Even this little dock cost nearly $5K to build."
905731,Big Cliff,2015-03-24 09:43:00,6899,"Yup, made the mistake of leaving mine in this fall, first time in 14 years ice formed early then broke up and came crashing back in. I'll be rebuilding my dock as soon as the weather warms up. Won't make that mistake again."
