905516,adempsey,2015-03-23 04:23:00,1498,"I used to go to Muskie Bay often.   Great place, but I am not sure if it's changed ownership or not. I haven't been there in a couple of years.  Check out their Hilltop Cottage.  I also frequented Elmhirst Resort.   It's really nice, but probably one of the most expensive on the lake.  Outdoor and Indoor pools and two restaurants, spa and all that.   They have cottages with 4/5 bedrooms."
905518,BFSC Kevin,2015-03-23 04:40:00,1351,You can take a look at Curtis point cottages
905519,mattp33,2015-03-23 04:44:00,290,"I stayed at sunshine cove for a week last year. We had the newest cottage that claims it sleeps 6 but it was really small. They all seemed small for the most part. They are livable, ok beds, decent kitchen. If you are just looking to fish than I may recommend it. I would ask for 1 with the lagest deck as it will give you more space.  The location is great for fishing, close to the river and right in walleye country.  It's not a very big poporty and the cottages are kinda close together. Met some nice people around the fire pit. They have an awesome fish hut with tables and freezers to store your catch. It's pretty cool  The docks are the best part for sure, if you are taking a boat this may be a factor for you. The are decent size, floating plastic docks with power near them. The orientation of them breaks waves well, and they are close to the cabins.  The owners live at the front gate so it's safe. Be careful around them the wife is a handful, they both seem to think their sh@t don't stink. They may have a fish fry mid week but didn't while I was there.  My girlfriend at the time wasn't a happy camper as it rained pretty much all week and the cabins don't have a lot to do in them. We actually left 2 days early as we couldn't take it anymore.  Hope this helps."

905601,Sinker,2015-03-23 21:05:00,8692,"I fish rice lake a lot, but never rented a cottage there because I live close by.
