898687,Bill Shearer,2015-02-17 21:21:00,456,Sounds like a great place to be with this winter. Good luck and take photos!
898718,captpierre,2015-02-17 23:24:00,2521,Sonofagun. We will be there part of that time. Read some reviews and seems the charters are weak. Just stocked up on salt water gear I'll be fishing the surf and renting a bike/moped to fish the bridges First time there for me.
898765,Sinker,2015-02-18 01:47:00,8692,"Been there a couple times now. What resort are you staying at? There are some good shore fishing spots for sure. Ive never done a guide, mostly because I hear they arent that great there. We had lots of fun fishing from shore. Im headed back the first week of april.  S."
898985,ah_long,2015-02-19 04:15:00,354,"#9 bridge, fish the night until dawn"
899019,bonessk01,2015-02-19 14:05:00,40,we'll be at iberostar on ensenachos so hopefully its with in walking distance
899025,Sinker,2015-02-19 14:27:00,8692,"There is good fishing right from that resort. There is an outcropping of rocks between the two beaches that can be good, and if you go all the way to the end of the beach closest to the main resort, the fishing in that channel can be awesome! Also take a troll on the hobie cats. Some of the operators won't let you take fishing gear, just find the right guy, and have the right amount of CUC's and you'll get some good trolling in for cuda's. Good luck!!  You can also rent bikes and go touring the bridges. I forget what numbers they are, but there is a good one just before you get to the resort on your bus ride out....have a look. Good fishing, and a pretty main channel. Night time is usually best. Fish the incoming tide and you'll have all sorts of action. Bring LOTS of line, hooks, and weights of various sizes from small to very large. You never know what you'll need, depending on whats around while your there.  Post a report, and let us know how ya make out!!!  S.     S."
899034,Loadman,2015-02-19 14:51:00,63,I will be there end of April.... sounds like just more than cigars and rum I will be doing... lol
899065,captpierre,2015-02-19 17:16:00,2521,We are staying at the Starfish.  I'm a short guy in mid 50's. Goatee. Wear a green Tilly. Come and say hello. Not sure I want to fish the bridges at night. Safe?

902576,captpierre,2015-03-09 20:57:00,2521,Hey Bill. WAs there same time. Not much life off the beach at the Starfish resort. Only the occasional pelican diving Trolled from a paddle boat for an hour mid day. Got a light hit. Probably a young cuda. Too chicken to rent a scooter and go to the bridges. Busy road with lots of trucks and buses. Didn't know was illegal to fish ?
902610,Sinker,2015-03-10 00:00:00,8692,"Thats the first ive heard about a permit. Im going to have to look into that, I leave in 3 weeks!!  Thanks for sharing. That area you were fishing can be really good aat the right time!!  S."
902740,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-10 21:35:00,390,"I will be there on April 3, packing some fishing stuff and will likely do a half day charter.  Looking to fish the end of Ensenachos beach, staying at the Iberostar."
905811,bonessk01,2015-03-24 19:52:00,40,"Aldolfo, Alberto and Juan on the ensenachos beach were really helpful to me I left them  each a bag of tackle , wish I had taken more but ran out of weight limit!  start off by catching small bait fish with same tackle you would use to catch panfish up here keep increasing the size until your onto really big fish is the only other thing I can think of that I didn't do!  Saw most of my fish at the north end of the Megano beach"
