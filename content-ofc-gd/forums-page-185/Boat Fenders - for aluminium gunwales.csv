906551,spincast,2015-03-28 14:19:00,3279,"Anybody tried Hull Hugr boat fenders? http://www.amazon.ca/HH-1CB-Hull-Hugr-Contour-Fender/dp/B000OF3J22/ref=pd_rhf_dp_p_img_2  Seems no matter how I set up the regular cylinder types, and whatever size I use, when the boat is below the top of the dock - particularly at Jordan where the concrete dock is, the boat will bounce against the dock. Wondering if the above will be the cure."
906561,bigbuck,2015-03-28 14:39:00,2449,Ypu could rig your bumpers horizontally across the top of the gunwhale. Basically a line running the length of the boat with bumpers on it.

906576,moxie,2015-03-28 15:04:00,1566,Bet they work like a charm and would be easier to store.

906613,cram,2015-03-28 16:54:00,1733,They look good.Anyone try those stowaway holdaway style things?   http://stowawayholdaway.com/
906615,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-28 16:56:00,8243,Last September  we were at  Muskenonje Lodge the same time Italo L.  was there to shoot a show. He had the same fenders and they looked mighty fine. What I like is they would take up less space to store than the traditional bumpers as they will lay flat as Bondar said above.
906626,irishfield,2015-03-28 17:40:00,26272,I have a pair.. but I use them to jam under my floats on rock faces..
