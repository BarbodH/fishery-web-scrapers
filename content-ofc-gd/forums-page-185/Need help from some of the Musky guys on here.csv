906182,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-27 00:23:00,455,Lol buy a 80 dollar lure that weighs 4-8 ounces and get a backlash mid cast. Your opinion will change  Hell do it with a 20 dollar lure.
906183,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-27 00:24:00,455,Also is your simax rod a bass rod or muskie rod
906201,captpierre,2015-03-27 01:11:00,2521,"Porkpie, caught a 52 incher and several in the high 40s in the Bog. Not real heavy though."
906231,quickme,2015-03-27 03:22:00,261,It's a bass MH
906247,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 03:54:00,2215,I will not  start fishing musky. I will not start fishing musky. I will not start fishing musky.
906287,Fisherpete,2015-03-27 13:20:00,1814,Join us Andrew. Come to the dark side. It is... your destiny.
906292,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-27 13:39:00,455,don't do it.
906298,TenInchJake,2015-03-27 13:57:00,21,"You have to figure there's a reason why every muskie guy says the same thing about line weight and equipment....and it's been mentioned at least 3 times in this thread. Still there's always the guy who comes in and says 'no you don't need that'. I've seen a 38"" muskie boatside released with a 7' ultralight, but I wouldn't recommend it. The 80- 100 lb braid protects your investment in lures. The rods suggested are purpose built for the baits and techniques you'll be using. The reels suggested will stand up to the abuse that throwing 9-12"" baits puts on them. The release tools are crucial. Fishing with the proper gear will almost eliminate delayed mortality by not over stressing the fish. Have fun."
906309,BillM,2015-03-27 14:38:00,17367,"i would use  20 foot long cedar poles as a rod and tow truck cable for my set up. c'mon really---  100 lb braid -- we catch anything and everything including muskies with 30 lb braid and a spinning reel ( yes a spinning reel) -can you believe it -set your drag properly and play the fish !!  --Enjoy the moment !! Trust me you will.  I don' t know if the fish is enjoying the moment too much though.  You need to get these fish in and released, you're not making much of a headway with 30lb braid and a spinning setup meant for bass.  Can you land a muskie on this?  For sure..  Should you be chasing these fish with a setup like this?  No.   All that heavy gear isn't just about not losing expensive lures..."
906351,lew,2015-03-27 16:30:00,12766,"I've talked to lots of guys over the years who tell me about all the muskies they've caught on light line and spinning reels, but most of them have never caught anything bigger than 30"" yet most of them seem to be experts....on everything."
906354,manitoubass2,2015-03-27 16:40:00,11391,"When I was in my early 20s I caught a 42"" pike while crappie fishing. Had 4lb mono on a lil 5'6"" light action rod.  I felt horrible after landing that fish. Even though it was incidental It bummed me right out.  Thats fish swam away, I hope she made it but I bet she didnt.  Use proper gear when your targetting these gnarly predators.  All these musky guys know exactly what they are talking about"
906372,quickme,2015-03-27 17:12:00,261,The few that I've caught have been reeled in quickly without any extended stress.  I made sure they were all revived and swam away healthy.  This was a bucket list fish for my father and I but sadly he was never able to land one in the 37 years I fished with him.  I have a soft spots for Musky's as it was the one that always got away from my dad and I.  I will echo my appreciation to everyone that has posted on here for all their tips and suggestions.   I'm looking forward to lining up my reel with some 80lb braid and hucking some big baits.  This is the first Musky caught and I've been hooked ever since.  Thanks again Guys.    
906375,Rich Clemens,2015-03-27 17:20:00,3131, This is the first Musky caught and I've been hooked ever since.  Thanks again Guys.    Funny.   Same here.  Caught one by accident and never looked back.   That's all it seems to take sometimes.

906401,quickme,2015-03-27 19:49:00,261,"Just double checking the regs and I was wondering... I have a Conservation fishing license, it states that I can not keep a musky ( always Catch and release anyways) does that mean I am not allowed to target them?"

You're legally allowed to target them.  Same idea as fishing for a species in a FMZ with no possession limit.   Get them in the boat, unhooked, back in the water."
906415,quickme,2015-03-27 21:12:00,261,Thank you for the clarification.  I was worried I would have to buy another 3 year license.
906434,Steve,2015-03-27 21:52:00,2075,"you can use a spinning rod and reel for muskie...just has to be the right one, lol.  and a 52"" muskie from Scugog is HUGE.  I took a guide on Scugog many years back. The guide, who only guided Scugog, and also worked on a Scugog tagging project, advised they had never seen a true 50"" muskie on Scugog.  So to catch a 52"" one (and many high 40's) means your likely the greatest angler who has ever fished Scugog, lol."
906455,irishfield,2015-03-27 22:49:00,26272,"Of course, except on Georgian Bay BillM.  If Bruce Ward (CO) sees you lift a musky out of the water on a Conservation Licence he will charge you with Possession, because he has nothing better to do than ride in the OPP boat and sit in court..... where I'd be if he tried charging anyone on my boat. I've heard his speech about same 3 times in the past 7 years. Although the last time I saw him, he and his OPP driver were locked in the HMS Tom Coffin and couldn't get out the sliding door. It was a quick check and Terry and I still laugh about that one..."
906459,Tom McCutcheon,2015-03-27 23:03:00,627,"Wayne has it right. Technically with a conservation license, you are not supposed to take the fish out of the water for any length of time other than to unhook it and release it. Some would say it should be unhooked/released while still in the water/net boat side.  Good luck in your new adventure."
906476,irishfield,2015-03-27 23:55:00,26272,"No... it's not right Tom... just the anal mind of a local CO. All the other COs around us have told me that they're embarrassed to be in the same boat with him when he starts into his ""you have $5000 worth of musky gear on the boat and you're too cheap to buy a sport licence.. what if you catch the next world record"" speech and I can tell you from personal experience that he really hates the ""then I'd have to let it go"" reply. Some you just can't win with!"
906502,manitoubass2,2015-03-28 01:01:00,11391,Ive talked this over with many COs about sturgeon. Not one said youd be fined for possession of a quickly released fish. Targeting them yes.
906080,quickme,2015-03-26 13:27:00,261,"After catching my first musky 2 years ago I've been Hooked.  I splurged on a Calcutta 401D and couldn't be happier.  I'm still new to fishing for the toothy critters but I now know why Musky fisherman are so passionate about them.   What I'm looking for is advice on line (Mono vs Braid), lbs to use and whether my 6'6"" MH simax wizard rod would be okay for now.  I like Mono and always will but braid seems more sensible because of its small diameter.  I am alright with a baitcaster ( may 1 birds nest every outing 2 Max) but am afraid that if I nest it i'll be chopping off $50 worth of braid.  What would be must have baits in the box?  Any advice would be great.  "

906086,quickme,2015-03-26 13:42:00,261,"thank you.  Any truth about Braid being hard on guides?  I have also read that braid floats quite a bit at first so there's a ""warm up"" period."

906123,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-26 17:09:00,455,also I wouldn't worry so much about the birdsnest. the heavier braid is much easier to untangle a birdsnest should you get one.  definitely stick to 80-100 pound braid. you will be happy with it.  I would also make sure you upgrade your rod to something 8 feet or longer as pete suggested. heavy action if you are looking for just one rod. the new shimano compres are much lighter than years past and pretty affordable.  all the best with the muskie hunting. it certainly becomes an addiction
906124,Rich Clemens,2015-03-26 17:13:00,3131,"I always use 80# power Pro and a good strong leader.  100+ LB Flouro is what I am using now. As far as the 6'6"" rod - I think you would be more comfortable with a longer rod - especially for the fig-8. I started out using 6' and constantly bending over the boat to perform even somewhat meaninful fig-8.   That got to be a pain real fast. I then went to 7' and a world of different even that much made. Now I am using 8' and really like it."
906125,Rich Clemens,2015-03-26 17:14:00,3131, And THAT'S the exact reason for the heavy braid  And make darn sure your clasp is closed and secure before you sling the large baits. I've made that mistake a time or two and zing ....   off she goes.

I want a 2 piece as it will be hard to fit an 8 ft rod in the car.   Got the simax rod for a steal of a deal and wouldn't have bought a one piece rod if it wasn't for the incredible deal.   I think I'm going to hit scugog for musky opener to test out the combo.

I would check out Sail, they have a 15% off fishing sale every month it seems.  Good place to get a specific 'ski rod as well (St Croix/Fenwick/Shimano).  A med heavy musky rod is not the same as a med heavy bass rod so go have a look.  I'm also a big advocate on a longer rod as it's better for longer casts and more general purpose.  I would recommend an 8' or 8'6"" heavy, fast action as a good place to start."
