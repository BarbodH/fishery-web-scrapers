905683,123chadder,2015-03-24 01:31:00,165,just wondering if the elite 4x with the hst wsu transducer measures speed when trolling....
905684,BillM,2015-03-24 01:36:00,17367,Yes.
905685,Terry,2015-03-24 01:36:00,14456,x means no gps so I would say no and it does not show a paddle wheel
905689,BillM,2015-03-24 01:39:00,17367,"Shouldn't need GPS for boat speed, it should get that from the transducer."
905693,Sinker,2015-03-24 01:42:00,8692,"I dont think it will myself. I have aa different lowrance unit, with the same transducer and it has no speed.  S."
905694,BillM,2015-03-24 01:43:00,17367,"Perhaps my pasta was laced with crack tonight, listen to the guys that actually have the unit and not me, lol."
905718,John Bacon,2015-03-24 04:00:00,3277,"Shouldn't need GPS for boat speed, it should get that from the transducer.  A transducer won't give speed.  But a paddle wheel will.  I think you would either need a paddle wheel or GPS to get speed."
905781,123chadder,2015-03-24 17:41:00,165,ok thanks
905900,Shloim,2015-03-25 10:33:00,515,"So is it safe to say ""all"" GPS units will give boat speed? My current crappy unit has no gps so ive been using my navionics app for speed. Also will the gps units indicate shoals and other obstacles on my map? Im thinking of a $600 unit for starters to eventually be the front unit and a larger one later on the console...."
905917,Raf,2015-03-25 13:00:00,3495,"yes all GPS units will give you speed.  if the map chip you put in your GPS unit has the lake you are on mapped, then yes it will show you shoals/obstacles/depth.. with varying degrees of accuracy (from good to what do you mean there's a rock there? the map show 30')."
905944,lakerguy,2015-03-25 15:48:00,224,I have a elite 4 paired with my minn Kota. It has GPS but it does not however show speed. At least I can't find out how to get it to show on screen. I have a elite 5 at the helm that shows me my speed. So I guess not all GPS units come with speed is what I'm trying to say
905945,Terry,2015-03-25 16:01:00,14456,If it has gps it will show speed you just need to add the data overlay in menu  so it shows up on your screen
905951,lakerguy,2015-03-25 17:01:00,224, I didn't realize that.
905963,123chadder,2015-03-25 18:30:00,165,will a phone gps work when you have no cell service?
905972,porkpie,2015-03-25 19:26:00,2521,"I've found navionics to be mostly accurate for depth.  As Raf said, be careful with the obstructions though.  Our family cottage is on Kashe lake, and they cover most of the obstructions but they have missed some doozies and if you hit one of them your in for a repair bill. $600 will get you a decent unit."
905983,123chadder,2015-03-25 20:02:00,165,navonics doesnt have dayohessarah lake in its lakes
