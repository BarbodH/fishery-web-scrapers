906097,Bassjunkey,2015-03-26 15:06:00,10,I was wondering if anyone could tell me where is some good spots to fish for trout on the Nottawasaga river? It is such a big river and have no idea where to start. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
906098,Freshtrax,2015-03-26 15:10:00,2215,"Takes a many a years to learn that river.   Lots of snags,( an understatement)  and runs pretty brown in the spring.    Good access in wasaga beach and angus.   Make sure you do your homework on no kill section of the river."
906101,BillM,2015-03-26 15:17:00,17367,No fish in the Notty.  Try the 'Geen instead.
906102,Bassjunkey,2015-03-26 15:28:00,10,Thanks for the responces. And BillM where is the green?
906103,Terry,2015-03-26 15:32:00,14456,Saw no r in Geen
906106,Bassjunkey,2015-03-26 15:39:00,10,Thanks Terry It was auto correct.

906112,Bassjunkey,2015-03-26 16:19:00,10,Thank you Sir. I have in laws that live close to the river I will give them a call for updates on how dirty it is.
906113,BillM,2015-03-26 16:29:00,17367,"Notty is muddy right now. Might clear in a few days, unlike last year when the high levels and mud went on forever.  It's going to be muddy for quite a while.  Lots of melt still to happen."
906114,adempsey,2015-03-26 16:41:00,1498,"I'd recommend calling some local tackle shops or hiring a guide.   Nobody will willingly give up their spots.  Definitely not on the internet, especially when it comes to river fishing."
906120,irishfield,2015-03-26 17:00:00,26272,"Might be a couple of holes out at the mouth ! That said, nobody here is going to give you a ""spot"" to fish. As noted, make sure you are aware of the no fish zone. Walk the river and find yourself some pools / undercuts / fallen trees and see what you can find with a few drifts."
906141,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-26 19:57:00,265,"If you're new to the notty, your first call should be to Graham Bristow.  He will show you the ropes and put you on fish.  Consider it an investment.  Im sure he will provide you with access points all over the Notty, while you pound chrome all day long on a drift boat trip."
906210,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 01:37:00,2215,Hey Brian.  You should take your tube out to that open water in the pic. You would slay fish.

Graham isn't going to give up his spots to his guests, don't fool yourself.  Best part about the Notty is all the private property."
906240,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 03:44:00,2215,Not if you have a canoe....or a certain boat I saw you floating down the river in
906263,misfish,2015-03-27 10:22:00,29133,"There are a lot of guys floating down the river now. It,s becoming a highway.   LOL Andrew, Ya I was thinking about that for sunday. It is possible."

906288,misfish,2015-03-27 13:21:00,29133,LOL Mike.
906429,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-27 21:44:00,265," Graham isn't going to give up his spots to his guests, don't fool yourself.  Best part about the Notty is all the private property. I didn't say ""his"" spots.  I said he would give you some access points or some general areas to fish.  Graham is a good guy and will help in any way he can."
