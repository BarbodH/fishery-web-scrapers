906451,spincast,2015-03-27 22:42:00,3279,LOL BB.  thats catfish blues...... need the brown trout boogie
906159,spincast,2015-03-26 23:18:00,3279,"Melting snow, a little rain, and my garage as of this aft..     I'm ready  now to find a couple more like this to start this season  "
906160,kickingfrog,2015-03-26 23:25:00,8333,"I was poking around the boat last weekend. Left the AA's in the flashlight, but other than that things are as ready as they can be. I might pull the boat out of the garage this weekend and start it up and check the trailer lights."
906163,spincast,2015-03-26 23:36:00,3279,"I've been trying to get at mine for two weeks but I was blocked in. I have a few upgrades I want to get at before downrigging season hits. Just having the boat back home feels good - means spring is here (and yes, Jordan is still frozen:) ) But there  is always Queenston till then"
906193,SuperDave,2015-03-27 00:39:00,204,My new rig comes home Monday!!
906198,Rod Caster,2015-03-27 01:03:00,5784,"Hey, you got your boat free. Did the neighbor finally move his vehicle?  You got that today? Christ that's a fat fish!"
906208,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 01:33:00,2215,I towed mine home last weekend.   If you need a partner any day let me know.   I can blow off work at a moments notice.
906209,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 01:34:00,2215,And I think 50 pt is open.
906230,BillM,2015-03-27 03:21:00,17367,Boat is patiently waiting in the garage for some shallow water brownies!
906254,spincast,2015-03-27 09:29:00,3279,"Hey, you got your boat free. Did the neighbor finally move his vehicle?  You got that today? Christ that's a fat fish! Yeah, finally. Lets just say we resorted to some illegal parking methodologies to by me the necessary clearance to go around. When they they on the feed, they are fat fish for sure.  They are a blast on a lighter set up (lighter in comparison to my usual big water stuff)  I towed mine home last weekend. If you need a partner any day let me know. I can blow off work at a moments notice. Wish I could say the same - pretty much a weekend warrior or holidays for me unfortunately. But if an open seat comes up I'll PM you - any luck on the search for you new boat yet? Did you look at that Offshore?  And I think 50 pt is open.  Really? Maybe I'll give them a call. That would be sweet if they are.  My last feed back is Jordan is still frozen, PD is open but no docks. Boat is patiently waiting in the garage for some shallow water brownies! I lack the patience part of that statement"
906323,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 15:06:00,2215,I'm going to have a look at a 22 ft hardtop on wed.  The price is right so if she checks out I will have a new ride.
906325,bigugli,2015-03-27 15:11:00,6138,Port D docks are now in according to the G&F.
906332,Fang,2015-03-27 15:31:00,1330,boats are out in front of Jordan and Port D this week. Mine gets unwrapped next weekend.
906337,fishdawg,2015-03-27 15:45:00,912,Yes docks are in at the ramp at Dalhousie  The 40th Annual Spring Salmon Derby begins in 2 weeks too!
906341,BillM,2015-03-27 16:02:00,17367,Water temps need to come up!!!
906348,JoshS,2015-03-27 16:25:00,729,"I got one last night from shore. My boats a few weeks away. If anyone needs a partner, would love to get out there from boat, feel free to fire me a pm."
906399,Joeytier,2015-03-27 19:39:00,3990,"My boat is still sitting under 3 feet of snow : (  On the plus side, the trails are still beautiful!  "
906406,lew,2015-03-27 20:18:00,12766,"Waiting patiently, but snug as a bug.  "
906408,porkpie,2015-03-27 20:34:00,2521,That is some garage!!
906409,Bondar,2015-03-27 20:44:00,817, Boats away...!?!? Nahhhhhh  
906410,dave524,2015-03-27 20:47:00,4508,"I assume that is the Niagara, wait till they take the ice boom out at Fort Erie"
906427,spincast,2015-03-27 21:42:00,3279,"That must have been from a couple weeks ago Jeff?  The mouth is ice and snow free from what I see on the webcam? Haven't seen a berg on the screen in a couple weeks - but yeah once the boom goes it'll be a bowling alley for sure.  Looks like next weekend should be worth a try - a few sunny days, coming up some + temps, a little rain in the mix.  Still - on Sunday I will be closer to the lake than home after G is finished his sparring practice..........sun, high of 4......"
906433,Bondar,2015-03-27 21:52:00,817,Yea was at the beginning of March lol
906436,Steve,2015-03-27 21:56:00,2075,smashing my boat and motor through the ice on the Niagara was fun......for a bit.  definitely better in January when the river is void of ice.
