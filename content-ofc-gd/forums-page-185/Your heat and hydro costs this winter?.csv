905495,bigugli,2015-03-23 01:13:00,6138,I do miss the days when I did not pay for heat. For 20 years I heated our house with wood. Baseboards only kicked on at 45F when nobody was home and the fire out.
905532,fish_fishburn,2015-03-23 12:32:00,1311,"Rod Caster, 13 to 15 chords of wood is a lot. Are you talking full chords? 16 inch length by 4ft high by 24 ft long stacked row. What type of wood stove do you use. I have used 2 chords this winter and am about to run out. My gas is about 40 bucks a month for hwt, and hydro is 80 mth. My woodstove runs 24 hrs a day from nov till april."
905551,Sinker,2015-03-23 15:27:00,8692,"That has to be face cords. I've burned almost 4 bush cords so far this year. Used 6 last winter, and had to buy two of those. I've never burned more than 4 until last year. Thats a lot of wood. I have a pacific energy airtight insert that works amazing. Very efficient.  S."
905552,Rod Caster,2015-03-23 15:38:00,5784,"No, single cords. 4 feet high, 8 feet wide, 16 inch logs. Sounds like your piles are 3 single cords? 6 cords for a year is good, if not a bit low for the Ottawa Valley?  I use a Pacific Energy airtight. It's a great stove, but we have a tall house with odd angles and a basement master bdrm, so it takes a lot for the heat to warm up the entire house. Also, when we are not home all day, I'm constantly restarting the fire and catching up on a cold house. That, imo, uses up a lot of wood.  Another factor is that I gather my own wood, so it's not all hardwood or even good maple. Probably 30% poplar, 20% white birch, 20% yellow, 20% maple, 10% other (cherry, ash..)  I have a new huge wood shed, which will help me manage everything a bit better this year. This was only my second year burning, still honing things.    "
905556,fish_fishburn,2015-03-23 15:53:00,1311,Last year I used 3 full chords. Was much colder last year and for longer. All my wood is seasoned oak and my stove is an Osburn h/e my house is a 1100 sq ft bungalow with the wood stove in the living room as well as 20 ft of south facing windows helps as well.

905563,Rod Caster,2015-03-23 16:18:00,5784,"Rod Caster, nice looking property. To be honest it kinda makes me jealous! City life blows. City life can be expensive too! Taxes, water, high housing costs...I would barely be able to afford a decent house in North Bay.  I counted 13 cars driving on that road last year (dead end)...doesn't get any quieter.  Back to the power consumption question.... am I the only person left in Ontario who is not on time-of-use????"

905568,NAW,2015-03-23 16:59:00,4022,"I sold me house in the summer, and I rent now. Inclusive, so I don't know the costs to run the house.  But my house last year... 2400 sq-ft cape code with vaulted ceilings. Poorly sized furnace and duct work. Junky windows. I went go through almost 4 tanks or oil last winter. My total last year was almost $4000. Jan and Feb where about $750 each month.  Hence, once reason why I sold that house!!! Just absolutely brutal. Brutal....."

I hear it nudged 1.00/liter last winter?  Don't know about this year.  glad to be on wood and NG this year.  But over 300 / month still sounds like a lot unless you're heating a tent."
905729,Big Cliff,2015-03-24 09:33:00,6899,"Well, that is for the last 5 months , Dec. to March. From April to Nov. last year it averaged $152.00/ Month so the overall average isn't that bad and that does include the kitchen range and gas hot water heater as well as the BBQ and fireplace."
906115,Mister G,2015-03-26 16:43:00,1429,"1200 sq foot ranch home with full basement. House is about 50 years old but I have all new energy efficient windows and doors, extra insulation in the walls when I had the place sided 30 years ago.  NO balanced budget billing on anything. But I do burn 3-4 face cords of wood at $60 per cord using a high tech Lopi air tight stove. House temps with the wood burner is always between 72-75 degrees. Thermostat is only set to 68 but rarely comes on, mostly at night.  With that all said my gas bill averages $60-$65 per month in the winter with hydro averaging about the same every month except in the summer when we run central air........then it bumps up to $100-$120 per month. Water bill is always about the same, $14 per month year round. We use gas for the furnace, hot water tank, drier, kitchen stove and outdoor BBQ.  I really think the wood burn stoves saves me a ton of money but it's a LOT of work and the older I get the less I really want to do it. Years ago I used wood day and night and burned 6 face cords per year."
906265,ketchenany,2015-03-27 11:03:00,3229,According to a story today Uncle Wynne is increasing our bill by 120 a year and could be more.

905258,leaf4,2015-03-22 01:31:00,2466,"Don't know my costs exactly but ballpark $450 for 2 months of hydro and it was $100-200 for gas.  Though keep in mind I have 4 tenants along with myself and my brother, so nothing too crazy all things considered"
905259,Raf,2015-03-22 01:33:00,3495,"we're 20 mins west of orangeville. 2 adults and a 3 yr old in a backsplit.  our water tank & dryer are electric, our hydro has been around 130-140 a month and that includes water.  our furnace is gas, as is our stove but we're on equal billing though so hard to gauge.. we also supplement heat with a wood stove (about a bush cord / year).  we keep it at 73 when home and 68 when not.  those really cold days back in feb, our furnace almost never ran but the fire was going, strictly wood heat which kept the middle floor at 75-76. anyway, it was around 700 for the year last year which is 55 a month.  according to the last bill,  we used less gas this year (15%) and about the same wood in the stove.  So i guesss we are at 180-190 a month for all utils averaged over the year Plus a bush cord.  hot water tank replacement this spring i think and we'll go gas, which should decrease our monthly bills (slightly more gas and quite a bit less hydro)."

905273,Canuck2fan,2015-03-22 02:05:00,1444,"My costs were the same... heat is included in my rent and my electric is always less for the juice than the taxes add ons and debt pay down... Of course the boiler is broke in the building I live in so the ambient temperature most mornings was 16C when I woke up.  My parents however is another matter. They moved out of their house on Nov 4th and it sold on March 9th.  A new 27 month old Rheem furnace quit 4 times over that span. 3 times due to a Reliance repairman being more concerned about his ""average visit count"" than doing the job right. It eventually took 7 visits by repairmen to ""fix"" a furnace less than 3yrs old. Thankfully it was all under warranty or I would be in jail. LOL.  18 separate water leaks caused by the furnace being off 31hrs less than 24hrs after it had ""repaired"" while we were out of town and couldn't do our daily check.  1 exploded toilet luckily the ice was still holding it together when I carried it outside, so no water damage LOL.  All this was discovered 6 days before the sale was supposed to close. A friend, my dad and I repaired all the damage in 3 nights after my friend got done work. We should not have hurried so much, because the buyers wanted another week extension on the Friday before the house was to close on the Monday.  Total cost of the repairs, including food and beverage was just under 400.00 (beverage 25% of that and my dad and I don't drink LOL)  Cost of gas for the 4+ months was a little over 700.00 for an empty house set at 62 then 72 for the last 2 weeks.  Hydro and water was 326.00, for the 4 months.  The cities water had never frozen into the house in 46 yrs but my parents would run water when it got really cold as most homes in areas prone to freezing are told to do here. Well it froze this year, having no furnace working for 31 hrs when it was -27C probably didn't help. It took the city 6 days to get to us to thaw out the line. When they came they were using us as the ground side trying to get the house next door flowing at the same time. Ours was thawed in 15 minutes, next door took 47 minutes.  So I don't know how that stacks up to the hammer, but my parents said it was about the same as last year, but they were paying rent on top in their apartment, where heat is included and the thermostat is to open the balcony door. It NEVER got below 82F and the bathtub has been leaking a pencil stream of water since they moved in but SKYLINE LIVING has new taps on order now for 3 months LOL. So they were thankful, heat, hydro and water were included in the rent."
