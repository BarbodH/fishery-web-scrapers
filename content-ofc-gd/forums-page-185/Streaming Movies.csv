The main reason I opted for one of theses boxes and or software was to watch hockey after Rogers screwed millions of hockey fans...I had no desire to give these pricks any more of my money!"

I am running the latest version of Kodi on my laptop and  also running the same on my Samsung tablet and I can stream movies, TV and sports in HD without issues."

She can watch all her shows and I can play any of my music files, it even plays all my lossless .flac files which is a bonus. It does not do Netflix but that is not how we operate."

Dave, the WDTV does do netflix if, one day, you decided to operate that way.  We use ours for all the above plus netflix/youtube.  I also torrent with internet speeds these days a 2hr movie takes 15 minutes to DL.  Usually better quality than what you'll find on the XBMC sites."
