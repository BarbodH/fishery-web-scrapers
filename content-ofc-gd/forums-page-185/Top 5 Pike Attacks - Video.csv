906074,solopaddler,2015-03-26 12:49:00,8605,Pretty cool. Number 3 is amazing.  
906076,FLEX ROD,2015-03-26 12:59:00,394,"Great video Mike, yes I also liked number 3.  John"
906077,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-26 13:00:00,937,That's crazy
906078,Locnar,2015-03-26 13:20:00,645,"#4, #3 and #1 are all awesome."
906087,adempsey,2015-03-26 13:58:00,1498,"NIce.   Although, I am not too sure about a pike being in a Koi pond...."
906093,Acountdeleted,2015-03-26 14:47:00,2562,Wow. Very cool. I bet someone is emotionally scarred after #3.  I believe it. At the Toronto zoo they have a koi pond with a creek that flows through it. It had a fish gate but pike could easily squeeze through
906116,leaf4,2015-03-26 16:43:00,2466,That's insane... They musta been hungry. pretty brave fish... I wonder the fate of the cat lol
906126,JoshS,2015-03-26 17:19:00,729,Neat videos. Hard to tell what's going on in #3. I was way back in my chair a little squeamish watching what was about to happen there.
906134,davey buoy,2015-03-26 18:58:00,5505,"Nature at it's finest,thanks for sharing Mike!"
906137,highdrifter,2015-03-26 19:45:00,2534,Wow. Very cool. I bet someone is emotionally scarred after #3.  I believe it. At the Toronto zoo they have a koi pond with a creek that flows through it. It had a fish gate but pike could easily squeeze through  I wouldn't worry about any fish making it's way up that creek..
906143,irishfield,2015-03-26 20:08:00,26272,What was with #1.. all I saw was a Beaver !
906144,kickingfrog,2015-03-26 20:32:00,8333,The first one was the one I like best. That hammer handle would rather get a suntan then be lunch.
906152,Fishwilly,2015-03-26 22:25:00,206,Pretty awesome pike attacks. Once tossed back a 3 pounder during a bass tourney and it spun around so fast and caught my one finger. Bled like a pig after that.
906154,Gallie,2015-03-26 22:31:00,1215,"Thats a cool video, i havnt seen the first one before and that was awesome."
906161,Terry,2015-03-26 23:27:00,14456,"What was with #1.. all I saw was a Beaver ! oh a plane, I was thinking I missed something lol"
906508,HTHM,2015-03-28 02:56:00,4082,"Neat videos. Hard to tell what's going on in #3. I was way back in my chair a little squeamish watching what was about to happen there. It missed, pause at 1:16 1:17 and I see two cats."
906509,kickingfrog,2015-03-28 03:10:00,8333,"It missed, pause at 1:16 1:17 and I see two cats.  Two cats? Or 1 and a half cats?"
906650,fisherman7,2015-03-28 19:29:00,325,I think the cats survived as far as I can tell.
