As one of our valued partners, we would appreciate your input on our program products and services, including the Guide to Eating Ontario Fish and fish contaminant data. Attached you will find a program description for reference. Please fill out this short (<10 min) survey to let us know how we arehttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/fcmp-feedback.Larry FMZ12 Rep"
906032,spincast,2015-03-26 00:38:00,3279,"that one wasn't thought out too well.  doesn't permit a null answer in fields to some of the questions - really how many of the public are gonna use the raw data or have a suggestion on how to improve it? if you dont use a source, you cant select null as an answer? N/A or No opinion as an option might have been a thought"
906041,bigugli,2015-03-26 01:35:00,6138,"  Actually it was perfectly thought out. Especially if you are focusing your survey to a specific outcome / proposal. A driven opinion poll has questions and language skewed towards a set of desired responses. They want respondents with definite positive/ negative responses. Looks like they are fishing for a response that either validates continued expenditures in the program, or justifies cancelling/ reducing the expenditures. A number of us university students, back in the day, used to write material for  survey companies and political parties in Toronto.  i still get a kick reading some of the stuff they try passing off."
906049,gogu392,2015-03-26 02:13:00,142,Survey completed. It will be nice to have also a way to know how much contaminates are farmed fish? Just to have a baseline. Are the farmed fish cleaner that wild? I doubt that.
906059,bigugli,2015-03-26 03:07:00,6138,"  That comes under the jurisdiction of different government agencies such as CFAO or CFIA. In the case of imported foodstuffs, CFIA is very hesitant to engage in chemical testing on foreign food sources, until a solid complaint is lodged. Put simply. the Feds are not going to put up a guide for eating ocean caught, farmed or imported fish."

I get that part - but if some, or some of, the answers don't apply to the person filling out the survey, and you can't leave them blank, nor answer with no opinion or an N/A the result is instead of getting a survey that shows (in this case) a bunch of resources  that are not being used, then the person doesn't complete the survey. That in itself skews the numbers."
906072,bigugli,2015-03-26 11:57:00,6138,"  It shows that not enough individuals are either using the resources, or familiar with them. The main goal of this survey was to get respondents to grade, by level of importance, a set of assets. Even if you only ranked the 2 assets you knew, the rest are auto ranked down the list. By default, they know which assets have greater value. A number of government surveys are skewed in this manner."
906092,pics,2015-03-26 14:47:00,1268,Every type of fish sold in Canada should be tested. So many uninformed people eat contaminated seafood. The guide to eating the sport fishing is very important....
906257,spincast,2015-03-27 09:40:00,3279,"wonder what would happen if they published an annual guide on other foods identifying antibiotics, growth hormones, and environmental contaminants such as pesticides?"
906258,Mister G,2015-03-27 09:50:00,1429,Every type of fish sold in Canada should be tested. So many uninformed people eat contaminated seafood. The guide to eating the sport fishing is very important.... People should be taking all these warning with a grain of salt. Take these argument points into consideration before you eat anything.  The meat industry has been organized for many years and that is why you don't see any warnings on their products when you purchase them in the grocery stores. Think BILLIONS of dollars here yearly.  The sport fishing industry does not have a lobby to influence government agencies to not put out said warnings like the meat industry has. Think small change compared to the meat industry.  Now lets turn to the health industry for one moment:  Go to any hospital and you will find many patients that have heart/coronary disease from eating  meat.  Ask any hospital or doctor how many patients that they have treated for eating too much fish and you will get a weird look thrown at you.  Just take a moment and think about what I just wrote above. And remember you have to eat something and you are going to die no matter what.
