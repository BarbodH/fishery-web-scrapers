904861,netminder,2015-03-20 14:05:00,514,"Just curious, do they not send you stickers any more when you renew your license, or do you have to carry around that big piece of paper? Two years in a row now I haven't got one."
904863,manitoubass2,2015-03-20 14:07:00,11391,Just go to a licenser or call the mnr and ask.  I had my card screwed up three times in a row. They always sent me a non resident.  Finally got the right card this year
904870,BillM,2015-03-20 14:17:00,17367,No more stickers.
904874,Raf,2015-03-20 14:26:00,3495,IMO it's best to get the 3yr license at the same time your 3yr card expires.  That way there's no messing around with stickers/paper.  It's on the card.
904899,Terry,2015-03-20 15:13:00,14456,I heard there is a way to fold the big paper to make it smaller.  Lol. But yup. If you don't get a 3 year you have to carry both the paper and the card
904931,irishfield,2015-03-20 17:41:00,26272,"Yep.. as stupid as the gun licence, you must be in possession of the card AND the piece of paper with the ""conditions"" stated on it (that are the same on the card!)"
904951,mike rousseau,2015-03-20 18:58:00,4661,Yup  X2
905086,Woodsman,2015-03-21 04:28:00,1286,At the start of Jan. I bought the card with 3 year fishing license. After 3 month without recieving the new card I called. Somehow they screwed up. They had my current address as my residence but subistuted the town (all other info the same) for my mailing address. No wonder I didn't recieve my card yet as I live in Seaforth & they sent it to Sebringville. Sending a new one. Said it should be here in 3 weeks. We'll see.
905660,Fishwilly,2015-03-24 00:12:00,206,"I still have 2 yrs left on my 3 year license with conservation fishing on it. We're now fishing lake O and would like to keep a few more fish. Is it possible to pay the difference to ""upgrade"" to sportsman license?"

905664,BillM,2015-03-24 00:24:00,17367,"You'll most likely have to upgrade to a sports license for the next year, then get a brand new 3 year after next year."
905671,bigugli,2015-03-24 00:54:00,6138,  Bought the renewals for the daughter and son in law at Christmas. They never received their cards in the mail. Supposedly new ones are being sent in the mail after a long circuitous discussion on the phone.
905758,Woodsman,2015-03-24 14:17:00,1286,In my case I pretty sure the screw up was at point of sale. Purchaced at Service Ontario in Stratford. Handed over my drivers license for address details. Residental address was entered correctly but mailing address was entered with wrong town. The miscorrectly entered town is only 5 km from this Service Ontario office and probally entered out of repetation.
