906339,Rattletrap2,2015-03-27 15:57:00,1652,"I built this propane smoker out of an old steel interior fridge and have used it to cook everything from cookies (no smoke) to veggies to 30lb chunks of pork. The double wall construction and insulation makes it hold heat very well so winter smoking isn't an issue and it'll easily maintain 400 f.     I have a ton of aged apple wood so I use it for everything, including salmon this weekend. Can we see an interior photo? Looks interesting! Thanks"

The soup might get watered down a little more and the bread sliced a little thinner, you might get handed an apron or a towel (or a hammer depending on what is going on at the time) but friends and family are what we enjoy the most.

906358,bigugli,2015-03-27 16:47:00,6138,"  That was the one the son bought last year on sale at TSC for $150. I like the fact you can use either propane or charcoal for your heat source. I like the propane when doing fish, chicken or jerky. Charcoal is my preference when cooking thick, heavier slabs of red meat."
906362,manitoubass2,2015-03-27 16:50:00,11391,Thats exactly the one im buying?
906373,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 17:16:00,6899,You can't build one for that price! Guess where I'm heading tomorrow morning

906402,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 19:52:00,6899,Oh but until you have had the cream of roasted garlic soup you ain't had nothing yet!
906403,manitoubass2,2015-03-27 20:03:00,11391," Yeah, your right its fantastic???  I prefer it with the scallops?"
906417,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 21:21:00,6899,"Salad shrimp, baby scalops tossed very lightly in butter just hot enough that it doesn't smoke for about 90 seconds then added to the cream of roasted garlic soup.....oh never mind now you know why I am called Big Cliff. Oh how I wish it was for another reason"
906421,manitoubass2,2015-03-27 21:29:00,11391,I forget who even gave me the recipes of yours?  We tried I think 4 maybe 5 different dishes cliff and they are all very very very good!
906425,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 21:40:00,6899,"As are yours my friend. I drool every time I look at some of your creations.  I was just showing some of them to Sue last night and she looked at me and said ""I didn't realize that these guys were chefs?"" I just said ""or something""!  This is without a doubt one of the best threads we have ever had on here, everyone helping each other without compitition."
905385,GBW,2015-03-22 17:06:00,8460,for fish I use the blend like I posted on page 1 (black cherry and apple). when I make my brine for the fish I keep some for a spray bottle too. keeps the fish nice and moist...  a great brine makes a huge diff too.
905389,manitoubass2,2015-03-22 17:34:00,11391,Im guessing searching for a fresh source of wood is better then store bought?  Or not much difference
905393,GBW,2015-03-22 17:52:00,8460,I have used both. I have a few bags of wood chips to go along with the wood chunks. The chunks I have are all cut from logs I have/had. Check your email Rick...
905395,manitoubass2,2015-03-22 17:57:00,11391,Will do Geoff?
905396,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-22 18:17:00,390,"I smoke both meat and fish, usually with hickory chunks.  I like to use my maple syrup in the brine, usually I will do a late sap boil which produces a very dark and heavily maple flavoured syrup that is great in brines and salad dressings."
905411,bigugli,2015-03-22 19:39:00,6138,  Bigger chips and chunks for smoking.  You also know how old they are. Some packaged stuff has been sitting on the store shelves 4 and 5 years or more.
905499,Rattletrap2,2015-03-23 01:52:00,1652,"Great posts guys! I am always on the lookout for anyone with apple or cherry trees that they want taken down. Pretty much any fruit or nut wood is good to use. Like already mentioned, you can over do it with some of the stronger woods. The result could be biterness in the meat.  My home built reverse flow unit will still be my main unit for when I have time to tend to it. There is something about the satisfaction of cooking on something you built yourself. I hope to use the WSM for longer smokes such as overnight. From what I have read, they are very simple to use and very fuel efficient. The 18.5"" model usually sells for $340 to $360 here. I found mine at HD just before Christmas with a sticker on it for $170 and could not pass it up. I am also in the process of building a mini WSM that is 14"" dia. There are tons of plans online to do this. i have read that the WSM's run hot for the first few smokes and it helps to use the water pan during this time only. Filling the pan with play sand and wrapping with heavy duty foil seems lie an option for later. Once you have things heated up, the sand acts as thermal mass to maintain an even temp.  Friends have the fancy pellet burners with electronic control, but that is not my style. The advantage to them is being able to set them up to cook and being able to leave and do other stuff without worrying about your fire dying down.  Lowes seems to be a pretty good source for a good selection of wood chunks and different types of charcoal."
905501,Rattletrap2,2015-03-23 01:59:00,1652," Here is a shot of my home built unit in operation! Cook Chamber is 12"" dia x 32"" long and made from an old refrigerant cylinder. The firebox is actually over sized for the CC but I like it to hold extra fuel. I have a single stainless steel grate inside. The chimney is sch.10 stainless steel as well. On second thought, i wish I had used the 100# propane cylinder in the background! There are adjustable air intakes under the fire and over the fire to control temps. The stack damper is only used to snuff out the fire when I'm done or to keep rain out when not in use. Controlling the fire is where the fun comes in providing you have the time to tend to it!"
905503,miller,2015-03-23 02:05:00,223,"I run a Bradley 4-rack digital electric smoker, great buy. Set it and forget it. Don't have to babysit it what so ever!"

905558,Fishwilly,2015-03-23 15:54:00,206,I'm also running a Bradley smoker. Ease of use with loading the pucks in the hopper. You're good for 12 hrs of smoke with one full load.

906128,Mister G,2015-03-26 17:23:00,1429,Im guessing searching for a fresh source of wood is better then store bought?  Or not much difference Since I use wood to heat I always have a lot lying around. I use mostly hickory and or maple....any kind of maple is very mild. I have never had a problem with hickory being to over powering.......I start off with a small charcoal fire and actually add small logs that have been soaking overnight in a 5 gallon bucket.  I have had this monster smoker/grill for over 15 years and have never seen another one like it. It's VERY heavy gauge steel and must weigh over 150 lbs. The bottom box is where you make the fire if your smoking. The top box can be used for the meat/fish being smoked or as a BBQ with either wood or charcoal. My sons have been looking for one like this for a few years with no luck.

I see Cliff does some bacon and Lucas F is into pulled pork in the oven. I built myself a reverse flow stick burner last year and really got into this as a hobby. I also picked up a Weber Smoky Mountain vertical cooker and can't wait to get going on that when things warm up a bit more. I have a huge packer brisket in the freezer just waiting!  Anyone else into doing pork shoulders, ribs, brisket, etc.?  I have done some beef jerky in the smoker, but find the oven does a great job on this."
905165,Andy,2015-03-21 18:53:00,330,"I smoke meat on a Weber Smoky Mountain regularly. I love it, especially on a Sunday during football season. Fire it up and smoke away while having a few pops and watching the games.  My favorite meats are ribs (4-6 hrs), pulled pork shoulders (8-10 hrs), salmon(2-2.5 hrs), brisket (about 6-8 hrs), and steak (about 30 minutes then finish on BBQ). There are lots of great rub recipes online, most fairly similar and most featuring common spices you already have on hand. My favorite woods so far are cherry, pecan and maple. I only use a couple of decent sized pieces of wood. I prefer versions of the 3-2-1 method. I usually start with the meat unwrapped for 2 hrs while the wood is really smoking, then wrap in foil until about 1/2 hr to 1 hr before done at which time I unwrap the meat for little firmer bark. I don't use water in the WSM. I have a clay flower pot base that I wrap in foil and slide into the bowl. I then cover the boil with foil so that is has a bit of a hollow in it. This catches the grease dripping from the meat. When you are done, you simply pull off the top layer of foil and the bowl stays clean. Easier to keep the temp up when the weather is cold too because you are not heating up any water. Don't hesitate to wrap potatoes and carrots in foil with a little butter, salt, pepper and whatever else you like. Put the potatoes on for the last 2 hrs or so and the carrots for the last 1 1/2 or so. They are amazing and you have done everything on the smoker. (rutabaga,  beets, any firm veg will work great) Have fun. Andy"
905169,GBW,2015-03-21 19:10:00,8460,"I smoke fish often but for some reason I didn't last year...  Cliff, Will (the former young_one) have sampled my cooking and said it was great so I'll take their word for it because I think its great too.  It's funny when I do smoke salmon, trout or even walleye it's gone in a few minutes when anyone's around; my kids included.  They eat it like it's candy...  I get the best flavours from a mix of black cherry and maple wood.  The leftover water in the bucket I use to soak the wood chunks (it smells like a wine) so I tend to put some of that in the drip bowl too.  Not sure if it helps the flavour or not but might as well put it to use..."
905179,manitoubass2,2015-03-21 20:01:00,11391,Im just getting into smoking this year so ill be following closely.  Any idea on options for smoking small quantities? Are those rigs from CT decent?

I really love smoked brisket best but not a steady diet of any smoked meat or fish. When in Finland we lived on smoked fish and Reindeer. I never had another piece of smoked anything for a few years. Reindeer is kinda hard to find around here, as well as Tar soup."

I made one many years ago out of wood and used an electric hotplate as well.  It really all depends on how you want to use it and how often and no matter what; you will not get the same feedback either way...  lol  I'm on my 4th smoker unit now...  PS, I had the $199 1 door master chef unit and I would rather of had the 2 door for the extra $50 based on what I had just seen on the CTC site.  *hence the edit*"

My favourite stuff is cold smoking cheese and spices. Super easy but the flavours you can get are amazing.

I've probably used it mostly for fish, from store bought trout, whitefish, pink salmon etc, to fresh caught Lakers and my favorite, Arctic Char from up north when I had the connection and worked for First Air. I've also done lots of spiced pork chops when they go on sale and then frozen for future use. Two more benefits I get from my smoker. I buy old bread loafs cheap and then dry  it out totally. Cut it chunks and smoke till golden. Process, and you have the best bread crumbs ever. So versatile. If you have an extra shelf take a pie plate with some quality salt on it and smoke it till golden. Amazing the difference a sprinkle of that can add to a meal.  Cheers"

905343,Freshtrax,2015-03-22 14:50:00,2215,Be careful with mesquite and hickory.   You can over smoke real easy.  I like cherry personally .    I usually only use wood hips for the first 2-3 hours of a smoke.  A nice mop is ness carry also I like red wine apple juice and shallots. Bring to a boil on the stove then let cool I keep it in a spray bottle.
905350,manitoubass2,2015-03-22 15:19:00,11391,"I like the spray idea, im sure lotsa stuff would be good for that.  When you say oversmoke, does that just mean its too intense of a flavor?"
905361,Freshtrax,2015-03-22 15:55:00,2215,"Yep,  too much smoke.   Can ruin a good piece of meat."
