Good thing we finished harvesting the last of the pussy willows back at the beginning of the week. Now we can focus on the seedlings on our nice warm grow benches and get the grow house all sealed up.  Next week I hunt for crappie.

906360,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-27 16:48:00,2582,  The pussy willow stems go to the flower auction.   That has reality show written all over it
906364,bigugli,2015-03-27 16:56:00,6138,"  The auction or ""clock"" is a Dutch system that has been in place in Toronto around 50 years.  It brings flowers direct to the wholesale buyers without the need to have 2-300 small scale growers going from  shop to shop selling their crops At one time large enough to be sole North American distributor of indoor potted flowers to Lowes USA, and one of a handful of nationwide distributors to Home Depot USA.  That was back when our dollar was below $.70 US"

906441,bigugli,2015-03-27 22:13:00,6138,  They are partially open already. We force them to be fully open for auction.
906540,Big Cliff,2015-03-28 13:37:00,6899,"There is no sign of open water anywhere in our area, most years we have ice out somewhere between April 1 and 15th. I have a feeling it is going to be a lot closer to the end of April this year."
