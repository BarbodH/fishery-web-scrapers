905820,John Bacon,2015-03-24 20:27:00,3277,Open season?  There are some limited hunting opportunities.  I am not sure about the season.  I think there is a lottery to get a tag; and the tag can only be used in a limited area.
905824,lew,2015-03-24 20:42:00,12766,"I posted this picture here 2 years ago Gerritt, it's an elk I spotted in a field on hwy 28 just north of # 7  Their beautiful animals and it's good to hear their spreading out.  "

905862,farsider,2015-03-25 00:08:00,456,"The French river herd is not doing as well.  Lost some to trains.  Both herds have lost some to unreported harvest.  An adjustment for some but, in the end an amazing re-introduction for the province.  Cheers, Mark"

905999,bigugli,2015-03-25 22:20:00,6138," Regretably no.  The fella selling it has, in the past, had venison, elk, moose and bear jerky available. I won't buy from him, but lots of tourists do every year."
