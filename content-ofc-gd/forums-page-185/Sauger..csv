906043,Joeytier,2015-03-26 01:38:00,3990,Great shot!  Love the looks of the sauger
906044,manitoubass2,2015-03-26 01:45:00,11391,Great shot!  I love how they look fresh outta the water
906045,Roy,2015-03-26 01:46:00,13728,"Great shot. Didn't know you had them up your way, Simon. Lots of them here too. Here, they don't have the same slot or possession limits that yellow walleye have."
906048,limeyangler,2015-03-26 02:06:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies guys!   Great shot. Didn't know you had them up your way, Simon. Lots of them here too. Here, they don't have the same slot or possession limits that yellow walleye have.   That would be awesome here, I could get 2 limits!"

906055,Whopper,2015-03-26 02:38:00,2174,"Down here we catch saugeye, their a cross between a walleye and a sauger. They get much bigger than a sauger and the only way you can tell the difference between them and a walleye is the spots on the dorsal fin"
906057,manitoubass2,2015-03-26 03:02:00,11391,"We get some big sauger in NW ontario. Ive caught plenty in the 14-16"" range.  There funny fish. Sometimes in the river, they come right up to shore in clear water sunshining. Ill catch them in waves. They move in move out quicker then walleye."
