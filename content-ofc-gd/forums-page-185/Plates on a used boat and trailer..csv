905723,Freshtrax,2015-03-24 05:34:00,2215,In the market for a used boat.... If i strike a deal how do I get the boat and trailer home?   Allot of the boats on my short list are hours away and don't like the idea of handing over cash and leaving the boat there while I go get plates.
905724,mike rousseau,2015-03-24 06:01:00,4661,Take it home and ship the plates back
905726,Bondar,2015-03-24 06:20:00,817,"Yea I just drove it home and shipped the guy his plate back, the one I drove from Ottawa to Niagara Falls with no problems. Just stay off the toll highways"
905734,porkpie,2015-03-24 11:18:00,2521,"Most guys have lent me their plates.  The last boat I bought the fella couldn't find his ownership so we towed it over to an MTO office and did the transfer there.  If your concerned and don't want to mail the plate back, you  could do that."
905750,206,2015-03-24 13:28:00,563,"I got 3 plates here form boat or camping trailers I have purchased, people just don't care and leave them on when they sell. I assume if they buy another they just get new plates."
905753,Gallie,2015-03-24 13:56:00,1215,It is the responsibilty of the seller to deal with their own plates. They are the ones who stand to lose if someone uses their plates for no good. If they dont care about the plates you are good to go
905754,Paudash,2015-03-24 13:57:00,273,"just go to the MTO and buy a set of plates for a home made trailer, cost is $35.00 I think.  Put them on any boat trailer when you buy it  I think I have 3 sets like that, on private sales people rarely have the paper work for the trailers anyway so when you register it they usually classify it as a home built anyway"
