The aim was to get us into some bigguns, and to actually land a big eye for gkasko.  Alas that didn't happen so I owe him a couple next time we're out! I got a couple of these real nice ones on the pause, only one picture attached, but they were both handled with much diligence and were immediately released with no problems!   As I said, we didn't land any monsters, but we did manage three around 7 pounds and a couple eaters.  Dad lost one big one due to a very poor hookset... but oh well, next season will give him a chance at redemption! lol "
905712,c10,2015-03-24 03:28:00,131,"The eaters were all about 17-24 inches, about the size of this one  and this one "
905714,c10,2015-03-24 03:32:00,131,"Here's one Dad got, however he doesn't want me posting pictures of him online so with some specialized technology I had to modify the picture... lol"

Fish-on You're right,  I personally have trouble keeping anything over 25"", even from quinte, I just find the big ones don't taste nearly as good anyways. But hey, you're allowed one over 24.8, just sucks to see guys keeping the 12lbers... oh well.You're also right about it being tough on new guys.  I have only been to Quinte a handful of times and my buddy didn't get one on his first trip sadly... It can really make you question your skills ahaha! I have started to get a pattern down but it can be tough! Especially since we don't have a sled or anything so it's hard to get to some of my preferred spots without a brutal trek lol, but oh well, they'll be there next season! Happy fishing!"
