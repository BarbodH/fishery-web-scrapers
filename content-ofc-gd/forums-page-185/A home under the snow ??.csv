905091,lew,2015-03-21 08:53:00,12766,"I was cleaning up in the yard yesterday after some of the snow melted and and came across this.  It's 6"" wide at the base, 5"" high and perfectly round and a week ago would have been under 2' of snow.  I can only guess some little critter has tunneled under the snow and used the grass he found there to build himself a winter home, maybe a mouse or vole ??  Anyone know for sure ??    "
905094,kickingfrog,2015-03-21 10:09:00,8333,My vote is vole. Nice a cozy under the snow for them.
905099,lew,2015-03-21 10:57:00,12766,"I've been doing a bit of reading this morning and it seems as if both mice & voles will burrow under the snow and build a nest to live in.  Still plenty of snow around here, infact we got another inch over night and it's still snowing now, but I'm gonna pay close attention to the ground when it melts.  Never had an issue before and hopefully it's not starting now."
905134,4x4bassin,2015-03-21 14:44:00,1025,"Ya , I would say a vole to Lew . Those little buggers hit my lawn every winter and cause some major damage !"

905156,lew,2015-03-21 17:35:00,12766,Ever resourceful our four legged friends  You have to give them credit for how they survive the brutal winters around here but I spose they've had a few million years...or whatever...to figure out what to do.
905483,Regan Thompson,2015-03-23 00:19:00,80,Did you look inside of it Lew?  LOL
905580,msp,2015-03-23 18:46:00,1336,This may answer your question Lew  
905602,lew,2015-03-23 21:07:00,12766,Thanks for the link msp that was great.  I watched a fox run across my front lawn awhile back and grab & kill a squirrel before the little guy even knew what was happening.  Maybe it's time to recruit him LOL
905898,Mister G,2015-03-25 10:21:00,1429,Typical shelter for a small Big Foot before growing to 9' tall. Get your camera ready and make sure all your pictures are far away and fuzzy to view.
905923,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-25 13:41:00,390,Isn't that York University in the background?
905982,lew,2015-03-25 19:55:00,12766,"Isn't that York University in the background?  Nope, York University's 100 miles west of that little grass igloo."
905995,Big Cliff,2015-03-25 22:02:00,6899,We have a cottentail living in the bushes beside our house and sometimes under our deck.  I've been feeding it all our vegetable scraps (and a few bags of carrots when Sue isn't looking LOL). It has gotten so tame that now it will let me go and put food in the pile for it while it sits a few feet away. This morning I went out to add to the food pile and there are coyote tracks all over the yard. Sure hope it didn't get the rabbit!
906028,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-26 00:13:00,390," Nope, York University's 100 miles west of that little grass igloo.  Sorry my comment was in reference to the mysterious tunnel they found back in Feb at York U"
906034,GBW,2015-03-26 00:43:00,8460,looks like a spot you missed raking up in the fall when you made a pile of leaves...
