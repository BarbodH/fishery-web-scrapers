905769,BillM,2015-03-24 17:00:00,17367,Those look really long and skinny to be piranha.
905770,HTHM,2015-03-24 17:02:00,4082,"Those look really long and skinny to be piranha. Well they are obviously malnourished, look at how aggressively they are feeding."
905772,Big Cliff,2015-03-24 17:05:00,6899,"Well when I first saw the heading I thought ""cold water"" and then I saw the post. I'll take the cold water anytime!"

905797,manitoubass2,2015-03-24 18:29:00,11391,Those dont look like pirahna to me either.  Whatever they are Im not swimming there?
905799,BillM,2015-03-24 18:42:00,17367,Could be some sort of catfish.
905800,manitoubass2,2015-03-24 18:52:00,11391," Hard to tell the video was very grainy for me, that and hundreds of fish going nutso at one time lol"
905802,BillM,2015-03-24 18:57:00,17367,Probably Atlantics.

905809,davey buoy,2015-03-24 19:32:00,5505,"Nothing like my 2, 15 year olds.They will bite your hand,but look nothing like those.Mine are red belly's,cool video just the same,wonder what they are ?"
905822,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-24 20:37:00,10439,Whatever they are I don't want to be in that water!!!
905839,Gerritt,2015-03-24 21:03:00,6129,I wonder.... Baked or fried?  After seeing this it makes the video of the pike bite look like licking an ice cream cone...  G
905875,Beavertail,2015-03-25 01:07:00,331,"Whatever they are, they probably wouldn't be too hard to catch! Pretty sure they'd eat a topwater, especially if you rolled it in ground beef first."
906067,G.mech,2015-03-26 10:11:00,830,"I think they may be Payara (vampire fish) which are a relative of the pirahna.  My son is studying marine biology at university, I've got him on the case and will see what he comes up with...."
