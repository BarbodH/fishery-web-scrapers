905707,jedimaster,2015-03-24 02:52:00,3472,"Anyone know where to start with a furnace not coming on? Tried new batteries in the honey thermostat. The pilot is lit, fuse is on. Tried new batteries, switching thermostat to manual fan on, resetting breaker, turning off the pilot waiting for 5 minutes then turning pilot back on. The fan won't come on nor will the gas ignite."
905709,Freshtrax,2015-03-24 03:11:00,2215,Should be some blinkey lights behind the panel on the furnace if it is a newer one with a key to decipher the blinkey lights on the panel.
905710,chris.brock,2015-03-24 03:14:00,4053,"A long shot, but I had a spider web in the orifice and had the same problem."
905713,NANUK,2015-03-24 03:30:00,797,"Sounds like an older furnace with a standing pilot ? probably no electronic circuit board & blinking lights ? Did you say the fan wont run on ""AUTO"" or ""ON"" position ? Do you have and are you handy with a multimeter ?"
905717,John Bacon,2015-03-24 03:58:00,3277,It could be the thermo-coupler; but I am sure there are other possibilities too.  I think this is something that you want a qualified technition to look at.
905722,jedimaster,2015-03-24 05:06:00,3472,"Renting here, called the landlord, he is going to swing by tomorrow was hoping it was something simple. It's an older one, has a honeywell circuit board But no blinkey lights."
905736,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-24 11:24:00,8243,On an older furnace it most likely is the thermocouple or thermopile. The first quick fix is to clean it with some emory cloth.
905743,Big Cliff,2015-03-24 12:00:00,6899,"Get it serviced by a qualified technician, if you play around with it and something goes wrong you could end up hurting or killing someone! It isn't worth taking the chance!"
905744,PSguy,2015-03-24 12:14:00,3,Google fix gas furnace. Often is just a matter of cleaning thermocouple with steel wool. Remove one screw and 5 minute job..
905745,Pikeslayer,2015-03-24 12:21:00,1443,"Also make sure your condensation drain hose is not blocked/clogged. If water backs up into the fan housing, your furnace will also shut down."
905747,lookinforwalleye,2015-03-24 13:01:00,4399,Problem solved call the landlord it's his problem....one of perks the of being a renter!

905763,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-24 14:56:00,8243,If the pilot is on and the thermocouple does not tell the gas safety shut off and gas control valve it is on the control valves will not open. Many interlocks but this usually is the culprit when it suddenly stops working. On an old unit I had the fan did not come on until the heat exchanger was up to temp otherwise it will blow cold then luke warm air not hot air. Nice to be a renter when this happens I guess.
905807,NANUK,2015-03-24 19:31:00,797,"As for the thermocouple, the pilot will not stay lit if the thermocouple was defective."
905813,vance,2015-03-24 20:05:00,719,"if the furnace fan will not run then there is a SERIOUS deeper problem,it should come on regardless of the heat setting or thermal coupler recognition !!  Please DON'T blow up your home trying to fix it get an expert !!!!!"
