905288,sleepjigging,2015-03-22 02:49:00,207,It was a cold and windy day. Water was choppy and muddy.  They are still sluggish from Lake Ontario. Hungry for trout roe. Released.
905290,Joeytier,2015-03-22 02:51:00,3990,Awesome chunk of chrome.  Nice one for the smoker
905299,chris.brock,2015-03-22 03:36:00,4053,"Good stuff Bain. I was going to say don't give your exact location but I see you're one step ahead.  Tell Kewley if his legs are cold, I like to fish in a snugee, Hahaha  Hope to get out with you guys soon, nice fish!"
905308,BowSlayer101,2015-03-22 09:02:00,296,"Nice fish! Im still pounding gbay chrome out on the ice! Most of them still aren't even loose yet and fresh from the lake, I guess it will be a later run than usual this year."
905340,sleepjigging,2015-03-22 14:28:00,207,"Part II. Upgrade to 25""  Cold front, wind changed direction, sunny, calmer water, no rain. I was luck with this one. Hands were close to frozen after a few minutes trying to reset the line after. "
905417,BillM,2015-03-22 20:12:00,17367,I think that fish might be frozen as well.
905448,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-22 22:40:00,265,"I was just going to say the same BillM.  Frozen eye for sure.  Not worth the picture unless you kept it, which i hope you did."
905453,chris.brock,2015-03-22 22:56:00,4053,"I was just going to say the same BillM.  Frozen eye for sure.  Not worth the picture unless you kept it, which i hope you did.  It's a fish report and fish picture on a fishing forum with lots of non fishing stuff like baby pictures etc. Bain knows what he's doing, don't give him grief."
905456,FloatnFly,2015-03-22 23:02:00,1640," It's a fish report and fish picture on a fishing forum with lots of non fishing stuff like baby pictures etc. Bain knows what he's doing, don't give him grief.   guilty until proven innocent right?  both are good catches! just hope this ice clears up quick and opens up the spawning grounds for these fish"
905489,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-23 00:35:00,265," It's a fish report and fish picture on a fishing forum with lots of non fishing stuff like baby pictures etc. Bain knows what he's doing, don't give him grief.  But it doesn't mean we can't support good fish handling practices.  It was just a question, don't get so excited."
905504,sleepjigging,2015-03-23 02:22:00,207,The sunshine can play tricks. 
905511,chris.brock,2015-03-23 02:47:00,4053,"You're assuming he torpedoed this frozen fish back in to the lake.  If there's an issue with keeping a legal fish, we've been down that road before."
905530,BillM,2015-03-23 12:28:00,17367,"Ok now I know that fish is frozen solid, lol!   I'm sure it was tasty."
905562,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-23 16:17:00,265,100% frozen.  mmmmmm....lake ontario steelhead. haha.
905579,Freshtrax,2015-03-23 18:40:00,2215,Nice catches .
905582,manitoubass2,2015-03-23 18:56:00,11391,"Id eat that, But what do I know im no steelheader.  Nice catches man!!! Miigwich for the report/pics!"
905583,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-23 18:58:00,265,"I just like to catch them.  Eating heavily polluted fish doesn't interest me. Read the MNR's guide to eating sport fish; and coming from a government agency I wouldn't even trust that their limits are reliable.  When the young, elderly and pregnant women shouldn't eat anything, that says it all to me.  But to each their own, enjoy!"
905595,ckewley,2015-03-23 20:27:00,699,"A Snugee eh! Not a bad idea & I'd fit in with the regular folk that fish that pier...LOL!!! Legs were soaked (wick-dry pants) packed rain gear for the top half just not the bottom. Saturday the pier was on fire with some 35+ fish landed, I wasn't fishing but had awesome fun watching everyone else catching. Bain caught his first ""real"" steelie & his euphoric expression was quite cool to see. As for the handling, I hate when this topic comes up because no matter how far you go to safe handle the fish someone else will always pipe in & say you didn't go far enough as though they were there watching your every move (no one here has done this). I can say that the fish that was released was 100% handled correctly given where we were fishing, even going so far as to dig snow to wet his hands before handling the little fella. Sundays fish left in a bag."
905661,Joeytier,2015-03-24 00:12:00,3990,"Ahh yes, snide comments from condescending gta steelheaders...spring is in the air lol!"
905672,porkpie,2015-03-24 00:55:00,2521,Nice fish!
905756,msp,2015-03-24 14:09:00,1336,I cant wait to bonk a nice hen this spring. I need roe No sarcasm
905808,Spiel,2015-03-24 19:31:00,9065,"Sad, truly!"
