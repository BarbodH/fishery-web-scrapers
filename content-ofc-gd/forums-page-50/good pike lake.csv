Taking father inlaw and his buddy pike fishing, we are just amateurs looking at catching pike in good numbers at nice size rather than the monsters. I'am trying to find a spot that the two of them can have good fishing while they can still get around fairly decent. Thanks in advance."
1040788,David Chong,2019-02-25 02:14:00,836,There are quite few lakes within that drive of the US border. Big Rideau lakeÂ & Charleston Lake are both within an hour of the border and offer good pike fishing along with bass & Lake Trout!
1040848,Rizzo,2019-02-25 23:39:00,4754,never heard of interstate 81...which border crossing is this?
