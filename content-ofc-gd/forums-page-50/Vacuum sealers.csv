1040728,Sinker,2019-02-23 16:50:00,8692,"I wasn't overly impressed by the food saver either. Its ok for dry things, but for fish, its not as good as freezing in a zip lock with water. The bags sometimes get punctured in the freezer too, so that voids the whole ""air tight"" theory. Even zip locks, with fish frozen in water is fine if the bag gets punctured.  For dry (ish) things its ok, but still gets expensive buying bags for it. I can get a good air tight zip lock with a straw. Just put a straw in the bag, seal it tight to the straw, and suck the air out. It works just about as good as a food saver. Just my opinion. S."
1040762,crappieperchhunter,2019-02-24 13:14:00,2582,Never thought of using a straw. Gotta try that. Thx for the tip. 
1040955,mamona,2019-02-28 14:43:00,597,"@Sinker What do you mean ""fish frozen in water""? Can you elaborate?"
1040963,OhioFisherman,2019-02-28 16:52:00,6623,"https://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/the-wild-chef/seven-tips-for-freezing-fish "" 5. Who remembers all those waxed milk cartons of fish in your parent’s freezer? Freezing fish in water is a great way to keep it fresh; however, the flesh can absorb water during the process, turning it mushy. Make sure your freezer is set to its coldest level to freeze fish as quickly as possible. """
1040965,Sinker,2019-02-28 17:02:00,8692,"Put fish in ziplock and fill with water. The water is airtight, and you get no freezerburn at all. The comment above is Bull as far as I'm concerned. Fish doesn't get mushy in water.  S."
1040969,OhioFisherman,2019-02-28 17:16:00,6623,"Ya, dad used to do it that way any we never had issues with mushy fish."
1040970,captpierre,2019-02-28 17:30:00,2521,Same.  I do this at the cottage. No mushy fillets. Likely some loss of flavour leaking into water. I’ve heard of people using milk instead of water. Never tried it.  Freezer burns ruin meat. Hate it.
1040972,mamona,2019-02-28 17:51:00,597,That's something new to me. Thanks for the tip! 
1041015,Sinker,2019-03-01 15:51:00,8692,"I didn't watch the video. I put mine in large zip locks with enough for a meal for the family, cover with water, suck the air out, and lay the bags flat in a tupperware container. Once they freeze laying flat, I take them out of the tupperware, and put them in a box, upright, and that's where they stay until I want to eat them. I find keeping it all together in a small box in the freezer helps keep the bags from getting punctured, and freezing the bags flat in the container keeps them kind of square, and flat so they store great in the small box. I mark them all with contents so its kind of like a filing cabinet of fish in the freezer. I only freeze perch and crappies in the spring, and the odd time walleye if I don't devour them right away.  It probably sounds like I have tons of fish in my freezer, but I really dont at all LOL....just like to have it organized and well taken care of if/when I do freeze it. Proper care before it even gets cleaned is the key to great fish. Anyone whos had one of my fish frys will tell you, I pride myself on my fish. S."
1040470,kickingfrog,2019-02-14 21:45:00,8333,Haven't bought one before. Anything to look out for? Is the price differences just bells and whistles? Costco has a few models but they are all within about $50.
1040472,wkrp,2019-02-14 22:45:00,656,I  would suggest buying a  better than 50 dollar unit. The bags are pricey but you soon learn how to economize. I have had one for many years and would quickly replace if I had to. you will love it
1040474,dave524,2019-02-14 23:04:00,4508,"Buy a genuine "" FoodSaver "" . Costco has about the best price and get the genuine 'FoodSaver "" bags there as well,  they go on sale, check the flyer they hand you when you go in and stock up then."

1040478,captpierre,2019-02-15 00:45:00,2521,Way better than zip lock bags. No freezer burns Love my Food-saver unit.
1040480,woodenboater,2019-02-15 03:01:00,2277,"if you have the money and plan to freeze A LOT, I'd buy a chamber vacuum sealer. I have a Foodsaver and reuse the bags and it does the job very well, but its a mess trying to seal liquid items (unless one froze it beforehand). Chamber sealers can bag liquids, but they cost waaay more than Foodsavers. and get the unit with built in roll cutter."
1040481,kickingfrog,2019-02-15 03:59:00,8333,"Ya, as a first time foray into this I'm not dropping those types of bucks for a chamber sealer. Are the bags proprietary, or can you use any vacuum plastic that fits the unit?"
1040482,kickingfrog,2019-02-15 04:18:00,8333,These are the ones I'm looking at from Costco:  
1040483,crappieperchhunter,2019-02-15 05:46:00,2582,"My take. I have a big veggie garden and I have also always bought bigger cuts of meat  on sale and cut up and froze into meal size portions. I tried a good food saver unit about 10 years ago and it lasted a year. Maybe I just had bad luck or maybe I used it a way more then your average Joe. Anyway since then I have found that if I take my portions and carefully wrap in saran wrap then seal in a ziplock bag it works just fine. I have had packages of frozen perch get buried and lost in the freezer sometimes for over a year and I know this because I date everything with a sharpie when it goes in the freezer. I find it, take it out and cook it up and it's just as good as stuff that has only been frozen for a couple of weeks. Wrap it in saran wrap carefully and squeeze out all the air and you will get zero freezer burn. I will never spend another dime on any type of vacuum sealer."
1040486,b2kptbo,2019-02-15 11:33:00,1505,"FoodSaver V4825 at Costco, you would go wrong..."
1040488,BassMan11,2019-02-15 12:21:00,583,"Bingo! Also when you do get get one, I recommend getting the roll of ""bags"" instead of pre-set individual medium or large bags. You can get a lot more bang for your buck out of the roll."
1040489,DanD,2019-02-15 12:26:00,2223,"I've had a food saver for many years and have never regretted buy it. I take the thing with us on fishing trips (as long as we have hydro) and package our take home fish with it. Partially freeze the fillets on a flat surface (dish drainer); once stiff to the touch, place them side by side in a vacuum bag and seal them. Perfect if you're stopped for an inspection; both sides of the fillet are visible. Why freeze the fillets;; so the the vacuuming doesn't squash them and the liquid in the fish doesn't get sucked into the machine. As for sealing liquids, it can be done very easily. I elevate the machine off the counter, by 4 or 5 inches; a shoe box works. Fill a bag 3/4 full, set the bag on the counter, put the open end in the machine and lock the lid. Push the vac button and just as the last bit of air is gone push the seal button. Saves a ton of room in the freezer; when you can stack the flat bags on a shelf. Other uses are almost endless; I have a complete change of cloths in the fish hut; sealed in a bag (11""X 12"" X 2"") oh yeah there also a bath towel in there to dry off; after that refreshing swim. LOL Potato chip bags, after taking out what you want, put the open end in the machine and push the seal button; nice air tight seal and the chips stay fresh. We don't use twist ties anymore on plastic bags; just pop the open end of any bag into the machine and reseal the bag. No more rock hard brown sugar or freezer burnt half bags of frozen vegetables. Yes the bags are not cheep to buy; but you don't have to always use the ""FoodSaver"" bags. Here's a place where you can get generic bags; that work just as good. Flex Pack Dan."

Most of my friends have more than one full sized deep freeze.

1040564,BillM,2019-02-19 01:27:00,17367,Make sure to wipe the seals down before each use.  If not they'll get grimmy and eventually never seal no matter how hard you push down on the stupid thing.
