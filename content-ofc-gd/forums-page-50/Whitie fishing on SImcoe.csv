I just happened to choose a day they didn't want to eat or play. It's actually amazing how many we marked coming in to check out our baits, but moved on quickly. Maybe next time."

1041249,jimmer,2019-03-08 16:42:00,2730,"Yeah, we did that and we missed a few hook ups. Barely feel them."
1041251,misfish,2019-03-08 17:06:00,29133,"Ya, I even had them pick it up and only knew when I seen the slack line. Tricky buggers."
1041252,jimmer,2019-03-08 17:31:00,2730,I was actually thinking of some of your previous posts about how tough it has been when we weren't hooking up and didn't feel so bad. Sometimes I think they hit the baits with a closed mouth.  It would be nice to see them on camera when they are acting this way.

1041265,misfish,2019-03-08 23:27:00,29133,"Another over populated presured fished area. Get away and you will find them. Not saying your hook up will be greater,but you will at least have the fish coming in for entertainment. LOL"
1041266,Fisherman,2019-03-09 00:09:00,7201,Ya think next week I'm going to try a little more shallow and bring my hut.
