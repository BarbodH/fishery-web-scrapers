1040703,dave524,2019-02-22 23:32:00,4508,"That's what we called them in the late 50's/60's before we had US fishing shows on the tube and learned they were crappie. First ones I caught were white crappie in the Chippewa Creek. Actually , it was those US shows that got us calling Pickeral , Walleyes as well ?."
1040705,misfish,2019-02-22 23:49:00,29133,"But a whitie is a whitie, no dought about it."
1040715,Mister G,2019-02-23 12:53:00,1429,"Actually on Lake Erie they have been called ""Yellow Pike"" because of it's cousin the ""Blue Pike"" that has now become extinct in Lake Erie and anywhere else they use to swim and I'm NOT referring to a Walleye with a blue coloring.  See  here for more info on this once GREAT Fish....... http://www.bagheera.com/inthewild/ext_blupike.htm"
1040722,AKRISONER,2019-02-23 14:54:00,5558,"Wonder where the idea of calling a northern pike a jack came from. when I grew up in Flin Flon we caught lake trout, perch, pickerel and jack fish.  calling crappie calico bass is hilarious because that’s a saltwater fish"
1040725,OhioFisherman,2019-02-23 15:27:00,6623,""" Questions for Thought: Cumulative effects can be difficult to predict and measure. Should commercial fishers have to reduce their fishing level because of pollution caused by another industry? No matter who is to blame does it make any sense to net a species to the verge of extinction? A lot of fishing in the Great Lakes and other regions is conducted from charter boats, boats that are hired for a day or a weekend to take fishers out to the good fishing spots. Boat owners and skippers depend on this business for their living. Should this kind of fishing be considered sport fishing or commercial fishing? Why might it make a difference in some cases? "" A great lakes boat can be a pricey item, and some people don't want to make that kind of investment for an item that might see limited use. A charter captain is selling a service, helping people catch fish, they are not actually selling the fish?"
1040748,Joeytier,2019-02-23 23:10:00,3990,Bingo!
1040761,Mister G,2019-02-24 13:00:00,1429,Commercial means making money off some kind of product/service so YES Charter Boat fishing in my eyes is definitely commercial fishing. I also consider TOURNAMENTS as another kind of commercial fishing being exploited by others to take advantage of our natural resources.  Large tournament after tournament can help destroy a lakes ability to sustain a species that is being targeted because even in catch and release tournaments a LOT of fish don't  survive. Take away the MONEY and this all goes away.
1040764,OhioFisherman,2019-02-24 16:19:00,6623,"So renting cabins on a lake and encouraging people to come and fish could also be commercial fishing? They are also exploiting our natural resources for profit? While I don't agree with all aspects of tournament fishing it has at least for bass encouraged awareness of catch and release to sustain a fishery? LOL, I remember fishing some of those same spots in my youth, we didn't see any bass, sure water quality has a lot to do with that though."
1040765,Mister G,2019-02-24 16:28:00,1429,"If you want to look at that way, that's up to you. However, most people who rent cabins/cottages/homes along any lake don't even fish. So NO I don't see it that way unless said rental property stipulated you MUST fish while renting said property. I don't know of any property that has that stipulation, do you ? ? ? Now when you pay a fee to enter into a fishing contest on said lake, I would highly assume that person intends on fishing that contest for a PROFIT."
1040766,OhioFisherman,2019-02-24 16:49:00,6623,"No I don't, never seen that stipulation, "" Now when you pay a fee to enter into a fishing contest on said lake, I would highly assume that person intends on fishing that contest for a PROFIT. "" LOL, for most people it is gambling, myself included."
1040767,Fisherman,2019-02-24 17:58:00,7201,"I think there's a gray line between sport and commercial fishing, the latter more so using nets and very large boats where the income supports just more than the Capt and mate if there is one."
1040604,TJQ,2019-02-20 17:33:00,7806,"Ya.. lol.. I spell it pickeral. There always a debate about whether a certain fish should be called a dore or a walleye or a pickeral...  When i grew up here in the northern Ontario, the only people who called this fish a walleye were our plentiful US visitors. Which was fine, as we understood the proper term to be walleye. Over the years I've made an effort to continue to call this fish a Pickeral, like my father and his father before as well as the Indigenous people here. Anyway.. a bit off track.  I've always been a fan of Artic and Antarctic exploration history... those dudes were tough! Anyway after all the news about Frankins Last expedition in the last couple years, I started reading about his first overland expedition up the Coppermine river.. basically they came in through Hudsons Bay and down the Saskatchewan river. Where doe all this go.. well I was reading Franklins account and he has a section (this is in 1819) 200 years ago.  Hes staying at a Hudsons Bay Post and gives a brief account of the fishing thats done by the residents...  I just thought its an interesting insite into how far back the term for pickeral goes.  (I would correct his spelling - but that would be rude i think lol) "
1040605,Fisherman,2019-02-20 17:38:00,7201,"Nice info,  makes you wonder where the name walleye came from."
1040606,Acountdeleted,2019-02-20 18:20:00,2562,My co-workers hate me because I say anything other then Sander Vitreus is just a nickname. Some pretty cool info there.
1040608,aplumma,2019-02-20 18:27:00,6896,"So, what’s all this about the “Canadian pickerel” really being a “walleye?” Are we talking about the same fish having two names? For generations, when Americans have said “It is a walleye,” we Canadians have—sometimes defiantly—responded, “We call it pickerel in Canada; Americans call it walleye.” Have we been wrong all these years? Well, the answer is yes. A few years ago after I wrote about pickerel fishing on Lake Winnipeg with commercial fishermen, a retired fish biologist contacted me to say that I had actually been fishing for walleye not pickerel. He said that the walleye and pickerel are two unrelated fish, do not even look similar and belong to two different fish families. “But don’t take my word for it” he said, “Check it out yourself.” I did. He was right. Who knew that all these years, we Canadians have been erroneously calling a walleye by the wrong name of pickerel A walleye (Sander vitreus) is the largest member of the perch family; can weigh over 20 pounds; varies in colour; tastes delicious, and is found in most of Canada and northern U.S. The pickerel is a member of the pike family (Esocidae); found only in eastern North America and is the common name for three closely-related freshwater fish: chain pickerel (Esox niger) which looks like a northern pike with a long snout; and the smaller redfin pickerel and grass pickerel (both Esox americanus). To many of us Canadians, the walleye is still our pickerel. Restaurants still list pickerel dinners on their menus and most stores (including the famous Fish House) still sell pickerel (not walleye) fillets and the delicious delicacy of pickerel cheeks. Two states and two provinces have adopted the walleye as their official fish: Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (though both provinces admit most residents still call it “pickerel”) and American states of Minnesota and South Dakota.  So can we file this under Tiller Vs Console debates. lol Art"
1040609,Acountdeleted,2019-02-20 18:33:00,2562,  Maybe that's why at some of the dive restaurants I go to along lake Erie they always give me Pike when they advertise it as 'Pickeral' on the menu. ?
1040610,lew,2019-02-20 18:38:00,12766,My Dad taught me to fish waaaay back in the early 50's and they were pickerel then and they're still pickerel today and they always will be pickerel.
1040611,porkpie,2019-02-20 18:55:00,2521,I to grew up pickerel fishing.  That’s what my grandpa called them.  I don’t think I knew what a walleye was until I started reading Ontario Fisherman.  I still fish for pickerel and I still hunt partridge from time to time.  That’s not about to change because of some biologist!
1040612,dave524,2019-02-20 19:03:00,4508,"The name Walleye was actually the result of some 1933 fisheries think tank coming up with name that wasn't biologically wrong. Dad born 1928 and gramps born 1902 called them Pickeral , actually the Ontario Regulations called them Yellow Pickeral right up to about 1970 if you look at some old regulations online.   https://ontariowalleyefishing.com/ontario-walleye-biology-fishing-resource/  edit: I just saw the length and weight data in that link I posted, not even close ........over 10 pounds for a 25 incher LOL ,be lucky to break 6"

1040616,Tomcat,2019-02-20 19:41:00,395,"When I fished the western basin of Lake Erie out of Colchester harbour with my Dad back in the mid 40s, he said we were fishing for pickerel. So for years, I called them pickerel too. After listening to so many Americans referring to the same fish as walleye, like aplumma, I did some research. And I too learned that the correct name for my favourite eating fish, Sander vitreus , was actually walleye. Consequently, I haven't been pickerel fishing for a long time. Au contraire, I've been and continue to go walleye fishing. Even so, it doesn't bother me much that so many Ontario fishermen refer to this fish as a pickerel. Old habits are difficult to overturn."
