1040594,AKRISONER,2019-02-20 04:33:00,5558,"lmao the local dealer in PAB was talking about that boat...for the close to 2000hp it only does 60 something miles an hour...kinda disappointing, but it does sleep 8...so you win some you lose some lol. Theres a guy in pointe au baril with 1350 hp strapped to the back of a scout...the boat is incredible, but i wouldnt wanna pay his fuel bill."
1040600,DRIFTER_016,2019-02-20 15:47:00,10439,Well it is 53 feet long.
1040602,TJQ,2019-02-20 17:08:00,7806,Wow!   A bit big for Camp Jiggy Jiggy!
1040603,OhioFisherman,2019-02-20 17:19:00,6623,https://www.boattrader.com/listing/2019-scout-420-lxf-103489156/ 800k for a 42 footer? Talk about sticker shock?
1040624,craigdritchie,2019-02-20 22:59:00,1586,"I was on this boat last week at the Miami Boat Show. Very luxurious. Very powerful. Very glad I don't have to fill its 3,312 L fuel tank. It'll run on 89 octane, but premium is strongly recommended if you go with those 425 hp Yamahas. Shouldn't cost you more than about $6,000 to fill it up. Have fun with that ;-) 530 LXF model flyer.pdf"
1040626,DRIFTER_016,2019-02-20 23:08:00,10439,It made it's debut at that show. It is a sexy beast isn't it Craig.  ?
1040632,craigdritchie,2019-02-21 02:12:00,1586,"LOL .... maybe. To me, it's a Ginger vs Maryann, or a Veronca vs Betty kind of thing. It is pretty, but it's not really for me ? Now this baby, on the other hand .... https://oceanalexander.com/yachts/90-skylounge/  "
1040633,DRIFTER_016,2019-02-21 02:19:00,10439,I could see myself trolling the Hannibal Bank off Panama and up the coast of Costa Rica in this bad boy.
1040643,SirCranksalot,2019-02-21 14:22:00,3291,"Did they say it had electric starters, or do you have to pull the cords????"
1040664,misfish,2019-02-21 23:50:00,29133,"If I won,I would buy the 1st house on the wall at the end of the bend. No boat needed."
1040666,Fisherman,2019-02-22 00:46:00,7201,"Never mind boat's if I ever win it big time,  I'm going to have a heated sidewalk, deck and driveway"
1040667,DRIFTER_016,2019-02-22 01:39:00,10439,Don't need heated sidewalks in the tropics during the winter.
1040669,SirCranksalot,2019-02-22 03:07:00,3291,How about you give me 1/2 your winnings and you can fish off my property all the time?? ??
