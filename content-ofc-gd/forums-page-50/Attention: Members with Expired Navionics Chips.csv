1040309,mamona,2019-02-10 18:15:00,597,My card is just 2GB. I would love have bigger one. Any idea if it is possible to copy/transfer all the contents to a new one? Will it work?
1040310,David Chong,2019-02-10 18:16:00,836,Rather than upgrading it on-line order a new card! 
1040367,Sharkbait22,2019-02-12 18:45:00,297,"Ok thanks Dave. I think I might have it. Here is a screen shot.  This will update my current card?  And, I get the advantage of Navi and Garmin products?  Instead of updating my 2GB card online they will send me a new one? Thanks for answering these questions.   "
1040370,Terry,2019-02-12 19:08:00,14456,"again that is us, it says free shipping but  , when you click canada they add 15 bucks shipping the cost in canadian bucks is   88.12 canadian ﻿all in"
1040375,David Chong,2019-02-12 19:47:00,836,"Yes, as Terry noted in the US the shipping is N/C but to Canada, there is a shipping charge. I do believe that Terry said that it ended up being $88.12 CDN when all was said & done!"
1040377,SmokestackLightnin,2019-02-12 20:01:00,390,"My total was $88.56 CA, still a good deal.  Thanks for sharing Dave."
1040378,Terry,2019-02-12 20:18:00,14456,i guess with the changing dollar it just depends on the exchange rate of the day 
1040379,David Chong,2019-02-12 20:27:00,836,Bang on Terry! Now if someone can do something about the Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange...
1040462,SmokestackLightnin,2019-02-14 19:18:00,390,"Received the package from Navionics yesterday, it was sent through USPS so no additional charge for custom brokerage."
1040532,mamona,2019-02-16 20:29:00,597,"Yeah, but I cannot renew through the app, unfortunately. If I understand correctly this is because of this weird 90 policy Starting from 3 months before the expiration of your subscription, you can renew it through the Chart Installer. Just connect your card to your computer, launch the app, and follow the procedure. Any idea how to take advantage of this promo? My card expires June 27th"
1040574,David Chong,2019-02-19 13:52:00,836,"Sorry mamona, I was at the Spring Fishing & Boat Show all weekend and at at the Lake Simcoe Ice Fishing Tournament! So if I understand you correctly, you can't even order a new card because your chip is not 90 days from expiration?"
1040576,mamona,2019-02-19 14:57:00,597,I decided to just renew my card. Cannot use the promo because of

1040680,Terry,2019-02-22 15:08:00,14456,Yes it is.  It even says that on the box but you can update sonar charts on line and if you register it you can get a deal in the future on another card.
1040684,misfish,2019-02-22 15:30:00,29133,"I have not seen the box yet. BUDDY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,?"
1040688,Terry,2019-02-22 16:47:00,14456,I’ve seen my box. that sounded wrong. Lol
1040695,Sinker,2019-02-22 20:21:00,8692,Got mine a few days ago. Just plug it in and go. Sweet deal!  S.
1040733,misfish,2019-02-23 17:29:00,29133,"Yup,it,s plug and play.  Want to thank David for posting this thread and the heads up for all of us to get upgraded, and to my buddy Terry for sparing an old chip and personally delivered it to my hut this morning .Plugged it in and presto bango,there I was,sitting in ???? fow (LOL ) Like I knew I was.

1040773,David Chong,2019-02-24 20:02:00,836,I'll see if I can get an answer!
1040794,David Chong,2019-02-25 14:57:00,836,"When you go to the Navionics site, sign into your account, click on the GPS Cards tab and you want to renew not update! Not sure why it didn't offer you the renewal when you tried to update. Also what type of card did you get with your bundle?"
1040812,Rob,2019-02-25 18:30:00,467,
1040815,Rob,2019-02-25 19:00:00,467,"Ok I got it figured out David, I had the original card and should have been using an updated card. Thanks David Rob C"

1040156,David Chong,2019-02-06 23:10:00,836,Did you register the card on the Navionics site when you initially got the card? If you did then your Navionics account should have a record of it and show it as expired. If so I do believe that you can click on that card and order a new card at 50% off which is US$49.99 Let me know how you make out!
1040161,misfish,2019-02-06 23:49:00,29133,"The card came with the finder when I bought it ( used ). I was unaware at the time, the small chip was missing til Bill M told me. I have nothing registered with Navionics. site."
1040162,Terry,2019-02-06 23:55:00,14456,Sounds like you have the adapter card not the Navionics card/chip with the maps on it Do you know what S O L means    sorry 
1040170,David Chong,2019-02-07 00:50:00,836,"Yeah, sorry Brian Terry is right! If you had registered it and lost it, you could have still got a new one!"

1040189,mamona,2019-02-07 14:33:00,597,I see the limited time offer for $49.99. Wondering how the renewal will work when my current card expires in June 2019.
1040190,David Chong,2019-02-07 14:35:00,836,"Unfortunately not, you still need to have the card registered on your Navionics account or have the Micro SD portion of it! I'll PM you and see if I can help!"
1040191,David Chong,2019-02-07 14:39:00,836,"Hey mamona, I've asked the question regarding if you had a card about to expire and find out if you get another year from when your subscription ends but haven't received an answer yet! I know that you can renew an expired card or one up to 90 days from expiration. Will update you as soon as I have an answer!"
1040193,David Chong,2019-02-07 14:53:00,836," Hey mamona, just heard back from them. Use the Chart Installer after you've logged into your Navionics account and as long as you purchase the 12 month subscription before the end of Feb. your 12 months will begin when your current subscription expires. Hope that this helps!"
1040195,BillM,2019-02-07 15:15:00,17367,I should probably update my ancient Navionics card before this deal ends.
1040196,Sinker,2019-02-07 15:58:00,8692,"Thanks for the heads up. Just ordered a new chip. Great deal!  My last one expired in 2014 LOL.... I couldn't get it to work on my PC though, the little check box at the end to acknowledge privacy wouldn't work, so I did it on my phone with no problem. S."

1040230,mamona,2019-02-08 03:17:00,597,"Is the card assigned to a device by any chance? I am planning to upgrade mine soon, just waiting for a deal."

1040282,Sharkbait22,2019-02-09 18:57:00,297,My card expired May 2018.   I'd be in for $200 bucks total US or CAD not sure.  Plus shipping (duty?) Too steep for what additional info I'll get? The depth info for some lakes I like to fish is crap/dangerous and these are some large popular lakes. 
1040291,David Chong,2019-02-10 00:33:00,836,"Nope, I have a couple cards on my Navionics account & one expired in 2015, I can renew it for another 12 months for $49.99 USD! Log into your Navionics account and select that card!"
