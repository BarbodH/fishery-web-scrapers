1040905,oldphart,2019-02-27 13:56:00,665,I haven't been up there for many decades and wondering if there any hut operations up there
1040907,misfish,2019-02-27 14:19:00,29133,No sir. Cannings has not operated in over 8 years now. Clarence past away a few years back. The only hut operator in the bay is Bear point outfitters.  http://www.fishhutrentals.com/about-2/
1040913,oldphart,2019-02-27 15:54:00,665,Thanks Misfish nice to know your still around 
1040914,NAW,2019-02-27 15:59:00,4022,There is a new guy renting huts not called K-Bay ice huts. He runs out of Johnson's and Minets.  Hear mixed reviews.  My friends went out with him a few weeks ago and got skunked.  But the next rental hut over (same guy) caught 7 white fish.   His huts are out deep in 100 FOW.  He had an add on Kijiji. https://www.kijiji.ca/v-travel-vacations/barrie/k-bay-ice-hut-rentals/1411130570 
1040915,misfish,2019-02-27 16:55:00,29133,Never knew that Nick.
1040922,Fisherman,2019-02-27 17:46:00,7201,At $75  day that's a bit steep.
1040923,NAW,2019-02-27 17:46:00,4022,Heard about him on the stupid Simcoe facebook page.  Can you believe one guy on their actually asked if all the ice blew off the lake in that wind storm.    Sorry folks.  There is such a things as a stupid question.
1040929,Fisherman,2019-02-27 18:50:00,7201,"There's a lot of them out there, unfortunately recessive genes seem to be the dominant ones.  I'm glad I'm old and there's only so many of those questions that have to be answered."
1040932,BillM,2019-02-27 19:37:00,17367,"Run and gun with Bear Point is $300 for a single, $225 per person with two people, lol.    And those are half days. I'd gladly pay that rate for muskie fishing, but lakers and whities on Simcoe?"
