Offering a substantial reward if everything gets back to me, or at least the auger batteries, you can keep the tackle, thanks for any help."

1040585,ketchenany,2019-02-20 01:00:00,3229,my hauger  fell off my sled when I was youg and stupid and there was a lot of traffic that Saturday afternoon going to the same spot on ninth line Oro never saw it again! But I  dropped  a bait box out of my vest in Meaford between shore rocks and six months later a I get a call all is found but the palstic box.  A first time fishing buddy (client) we took with us went back with marine magnets and picked everything up.

1040599,lew,2019-02-20 12:24:00,12766,We spent a week at a cabin on Angus Lake on hwy 11 south of Temagami about 15 years ago and found a fully loaded tackle box on the side of the hwy one day. No type of identification in it so we dropped it off at a local bait shop but I don't know if anyone ever claimed it.
1040657,BowSlayer101,2019-02-21 19:28:00,296,"No this was depot Brian, that place was on joseph i believe."
