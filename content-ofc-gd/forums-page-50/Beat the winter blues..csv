I fish from shore there except for my annual meet up with my good friend Nick who also happens to be the best inshore guide on the island. We spent an afternoon on his raft hitting up different spots, fishing was slow until we went the live bait under a slip bobber route. Got into a bunch of small fish until we hit a channel with current, then BANG...big fish on.  "
