1036982,spincast,2018-11-25 23:32:00,3279,you'll probably get more answers from Mike Borgers site - its fly-in focused https://www.canadafishingguide.net/forum-2/
1039676,Phil S C,2019-01-25 21:03:00,11,"Flew out to Nettogami  with Cochrane Air last June. After flying with them for many years our group has decided to give Hearst Air a try this year due to Cochrane Air being under staffed , under equipped and totally unorganized. They have too many camps and not enough staff to maintain them or planes to get you there. The office manager Kim held them together as best as she could but was removed last year. Good luck on your fly-in experience this year."
1039744,Moosebunk,2019-01-27 00:43:00,3970,Flew into Snare and had chance to fish Bateman and the other adjacent lake years ago for a July trip. By fly-in standards the fishing was pretty slow...
1039748,adempsey,2019-01-27 02:52:00,1498,Two of their lakes give you access to Kesagami if that interests you. I thought you fished Partridge before Mr. Bunk?
1039749,Moosebunk,2019-01-27 03:22:00,3970,Yeah!!! Forgot about that. Cochrane Air didn't own the camp on Partridge the few trip years I was there... and they do now.  How I'd love to revisit that cabin on Partridge and fish Kesagami again.  Great fishing... and the last time I was there Brenda and I had Kesagami all to ourselves for a week. Not another soul. What a great time. http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/kesagami-reflections/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKGii_uaYaw
1040081,fisherman7,2019-02-05 15:11:00,325,Can't go wrong with Hearst Air. What lake are you going to?

1040110,fisherman7,2019-02-06 13:44:00,325,"I've been to Quantz a couple of time. Last time I had a wolf cub follow me up and down the shoreline when I was trolling. Pretty neat. There's also a family of beavers that come up by the dock to take raspberry bushes. Fun to watch. You should look at Napken next time. A little more expensive but fun, but for the ultimate in big pike, Pym is the best. Have fun!"

1040112,Phil S C,2019-02-06 13:56:00,11,"Thanks, Napken wasn't available for early June, going to try Quantz early June and Napken late July next year."
1040911,scuro2,2019-02-27 14:42:00,904,"Kesagami is over fished and I would only consider early spring or when the main camp shuts down, but I don't think they fly into Partridge anymore once the main camp has closed. For that type of money I'd look elsewhere first. Their little isolated fishing camps have their charms and for the right price would be fun. Some only get fished once or twice a year, if that. That is the type of conversation I would be having. Do your homework. Just don't go in with huge expectations."
1041053,pairofgreenhorns,2019-03-03 03:28:00,133,"fished tomorrow lake with my wife years ago, was slow by fly in standards but the cabin was nice and clean and the couch pulled out into a double bed - decided to head northwest. doing Melchett in July through Boreal Forest Outfitters"
