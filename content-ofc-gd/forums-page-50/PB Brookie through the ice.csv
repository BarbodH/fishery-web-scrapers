1040751,brkygetr,2019-02-24 00:42:00,425,"100% squaretail in this guys mind!! We got 5 more and they all had very light markings...but a very square tail with no laker head. Got it on a worm with single splitshot. Funny part is it happened within 1 min of tapping the hole after we had spent the previous 3 hours trying to break trail into a lake that has now stumped us for 2 years. last year we got turned around by a beaver dam, this year we got punished by the amount of snow. the Tundra wouldn't make it and after digging it out 3 times we turned around. This was camp on a delightful -26 degree Sunday morning.  "
