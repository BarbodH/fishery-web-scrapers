1041254,Sinker,2019-03-08 18:12:00,8692,"Saw trucks out there, and you'd have no problem except for the cracks. 20+ inches of ice, and not a whole lot of snow.  S."
1041255,gone_fishin,2019-03-08 18:20:00,481,"Beautiful! Thank you Sir! Not going out too far, just gonna do the perch thing. just don't want to walk if i don't have to. hahaha"
