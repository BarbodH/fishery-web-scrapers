1040820,Jimjim,2019-02-25 19:46:00,5,What baits am I alllowed to use in Ontario? Can I use things like mackerel from the grocery store?
1040833,BillM,2019-02-25 21:53:00,17367,"Depends on the FMZ you're in and the water of body you're fishing.   But for fish like pike in most places, dead bait is fine (mackerel included)"
1040834,AKRISONER,2019-02-25 21:55:00,5558,The main restrictions relate to not using bait at all. If you dont see any restrictions in that sense then you are good to go with any grocery store bought bait. The only restriction then would be what kind of live bait you are allowed to use...i.e. you cant use perch as live bait.
1040836,Jimjim,2019-02-25 22:03:00,5,What about lake trout in FMZ 14
1040837,BillM,2019-02-25 22:05:00,17367,Check the regs.
1040839,Jimjim,2019-02-25 22:18:00,5,So...if it does not say I CANT use grocery store bait....it means I can use it?
1040840,AKRISONER,2019-02-25 22:20:00,5558,"or any form of ""bait"" for that matter, worms, minnows etc etc There are a few places where only artificial lures are allowed. Thats what you would be looking for."
1040847,Rizzo,2019-02-25 23:36:00,4754,I always though grocery store smelt or herring were a no no...but don't quote me on that. I never planned on using either of em so never looked it up
1040855,BillM,2019-02-26 00:51:00,17367,"There aren't many restrictions on dead bait, I know of one lake where there's only one specific type of dead bait allowed.   Guys use herring/mackerel for deadsticking pike all the time, especially in the spring time and open water as well."
1040856,Jimjim,2019-02-26 01:00:00,5,The regulations show a list of species that you are allowed to use...but doesn’t say what you can’t use. 
1040859,Jimjim,2019-02-26 01:22:00,5, 
1040860,BillM,2019-02-26 02:18:00,17367,You're fine fishing dead bait unless it explicitly says you can't in the FMZ 14 regs.
1040942,Joeytier,2019-02-27 23:11:00,3990,"Just read the regulations, it's all there in plain English, and you remove any doubt of innacurate info."
