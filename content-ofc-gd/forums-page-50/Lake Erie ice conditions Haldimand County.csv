Usually huge mounds of ice are on the shore line as wind blows ice flows close to shore then freeze. That cold snap last week and low south winds have the shoreline very flat and accessible. Usually sleds and quads have to climb huge icebergs, not this year. I thought this place was going to blow away last Wed. Visibility was maybe 2 feet. A large automotive garage burnt to the ground in Selkirk during the storm. I can't imagine the conditions our brave volunteer fire fighters had to endure. The only plus was it was a few hundred yards from our firehall."
