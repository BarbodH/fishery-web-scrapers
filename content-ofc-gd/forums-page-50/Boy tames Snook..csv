The fish hit my weedless set up 3 times with no hook up so I changed us both over to 3/8oz swimbait jig head with a 3.5” Berkeley Ripple Shad in the tried and trusted pearl/pink. 3 minutes later I hear Jack yelling and turn around to see something on his line almost pulling him over. I had to use every ounce of self control not to take the rod from him even though he asked and was a little bit panicky, he thought it might be a shark and was scared. He did a superb job of taming the fish and was a little bit pumped, so pumped in fact that we ended up leaving 5 minutes later because he wanted to tell his mum!  "
