1039873,Muskie_magnet,2019-01-30 17:57:00,2,Mostly right handed with left hand reels but do keep 1 right hand reel in the boat for when I get worn out chucking muskie baits.  It's nice to be able to take a break and switch over.  Didn't take very long at all to get comfortable switching back and forth. 
1039875,David Chong,2019-01-30 18:25:00,836,Very impressed that over 74% of respondents are using what I believe is the most logical combination. I originally started using a right-handed baitcaster reel but eventually realized that it really didn't make sense to cast with my right arm and then switch hands. I prefer to have my rod in my power arm and more coordinated arm.
1039918,Garnet,2019-01-31 17:49:00,2056,"I always changed hands, witch forced me to have rod in both hands when my bait hit the water. Far more secure hook sets this way."
1040077,bigbuck,2019-02-05 13:47:00,2449,"I'm a righty. I use a right hand baitcaster, I tried the lefty side but just could not get the hang of it. So I cast switch and retrieve. I use my left to retrieve with spinning gear. Go figure, I sure can't."
1040083,David Chong,2019-02-05 15:30:00,836,It felt weird when I switched as well @bigbuck but I stuck with it and am glad I did! Now it feels weird when I try a right-hand retrieve reel! LOL
1040109,J Roelofsen,2019-02-06 13:43:00,84,"I'm a lefty and cast right, reel left with spinning and float gear. Cast left reel right with casting gear. But with a single hand fly rod I cast with left and strip with right.....until I hookup then I switch to reeling with the left. When I played hardball in my younger years I batted switch and actually pitched with both hands depending on the batter..... Josh"
1040113,KawarthaAngler,2019-02-06 14:12:00,273,Every persons 'normal' is in their own head and unique to every person.  Thus there truly is no normal.
1040114,KawarthaAngler,2019-02-06 14:17:00,273,"For me, as a kid I had one spinning reel and it was a left retrieve (like I believe most were).  So I learned to hold the rod with my right hand and retrieve with my left. In my adult years when I purchased more spinning reels they were the same.  When I purchased my first baitcaster I did the same, left hand retrieve since that is what I was use to and it made sense. Then I started watching televised tournaments and saw guys that were right handed like me, cast their baitcaster with their right hand (like I do), then switch hands to also retrieve with their right.  That's when I scratched my head and said 'what are these loonies doing?'   LOL"
1040116,bigbuck,2019-02-06 14:28:00,2449,I tried it for almost a whole summer. I just could not do it.

1040286,Garnet,2019-02-09 20:37:00,2056,Watched Chris Johnston switch hands all day. Didn't seem disadvantaged . Does it completely different than me.
1040297,Old Ironmaker,2019-02-10 10:53:00,8243,"My very 1st time using a spinning reel I borrowed my brothers Mitchel 300, left hand retrieve. I had to turn it upside down to reel it with my right, backwards. I cast right handed and reel right handed. Being ambidextrous can get confusing. I write left handed unless a big white/blackboard I then use my right hand ."
1040547,Reelpro,2019-02-18 16:57:00,73,"Right handed and I always reel with left hand. 30 years ago it was pretty hard to find left hand baitcasters - the manufacturers pretty much only made right handed ones then, and retailers rarely stocked the lefty's that were available, which is why tons of anglers got used to ""switching hands"" after casting. If you cast the rod with your right arm - only logical to reel with the other. "
1040552,OhioFisherman,2019-02-18 18:12:00,6623,"Even a lot of tackle stores didn't stock lefty's back then, my first was an Abu 5001c I saw at a local tackle shop and bought on the spot, he only had one. Not positive of the time line anymore, but we moved to the burbs in 1973 and I know I had it when we moved, it was the only lefty I had ever seen up to then. I think Shimano did a lot to make them more readily available."
1040553,dave524,2019-02-18 20:22:00,4508,"Back in the 50's/ 60's, before free spool reels were common , I don't recall ever seeing a lefty direct drive knuckle buster, fished a lot with Langely's and Inglis /Shakespeares in those days."
1040568,OhioFisherman,2019-02-19 03:43:00,6623,"Ya, same here Dave, I don't ever recall seeing a lefty knuckle buster. My first free spool reel was an Abu 1750, not much difference in size than the Langleys and also casted well. LOL, I think I paid around 15 bucks for it new, and around 25 bucks for my 2 5001c's, sold all 3 of them to a Japanese reel collector back in the later 1990's for 450 bucks. Given the price price of reels these days I broke even?"

1040723,DropShot'r,2019-02-23 15:05:00,62,I'm left handed and it makes no difference on the rod. I cast left and retrieve right. Switching hands on every cast? I don't get it. Makes no sense to me.
1040730,BillM,2019-02-23 17:07:00,17367,"It's because you don't do it, lol.   I switch hands mid cast, doesn't interrupt a thing.  I'm sure the thought of it seems odd.   If you saw it in person you probably wouldn't even notice it."
1039765,Canuck,2019-01-27 20:20:00,491,A boredom poll on people's reel retrieve preference and why.  Its multiple choice because I expect that it might depend on the type of reel or the quarry.
1039766,woodenboater,2019-01-27 20:37:00,2277,"never really got the 'cast with one hand, then switch over to retrieve' method. Also since my right is stronger, prefer that for rod handling where I want more control/finesse. does make it harder when looking for used reels in the classifieds lol"

It's just more comfortable, logical to me and that's how I learned. I've asked a lot of folks this question: if you're right handed and use a right cranking bait caster, then why?  Why switch hands?  Makes no sense to me. The only logical response I've ever heard is ""I learned that way"" or ""there were no left handed retrieve bait casters when I learned to fish"" "

I also had to switch my writing hand in junior kindergarten because I smudged.LOL   Spinning reel = cast right, reel left Baitcasting reel = Cast left, reel right (Although I’m comfortable casting or reeling with either hand) Float reel/centrepin = Cast right, reel left (although I'm comfortable casting or reeling with either hand) Fly reel = Cast right, reel left  When it comes down to it, the hand that I cast or reel with is primarily based on the first rod combos that I had as a kid.

I also cut my food with the knife in my left hand and feed with my right. apparently also uncommon
1039798,Lape0019,2019-01-28 20:04:00,647,"It ends up being personal preference and what you are comfortable with. For me, I am right handed and reel with my right on both spinning and baitcast setups. I've tried reeling with left hand and find it uncomfortable."
1039804,chris.brock,2019-01-29 00:08:00,4053,My brother always reeled with his right on his bait casters. He bought a left hand retrieve bait caster for a good deal when Burns was going out of business. He said it wasn't a big deal and didn't take too long to switch over and feel comfortable.

I always figured I wanted the dexterity on my reeling hand and strength to set the hook was easier to teach for my non-dominant hand.  Now, the problem has become, about 5 years ago JoeyTier taught me how to do the 'pencil grip' for ice fishing jigging. I love it but I can only do it with my left hand. So its, jig, set the hook, switch hands, reel........ or more accurately, jig, set the hook, switch hands, fish has spit the hook, scream into the hole for 15 minutes."

1039847,Canuck,2019-01-29 21:39:00,491,"I am right handed.  Baseball and golf right.  Hockey left.  Cast right and retrieve right, but can do both with either hand.  I prefer right retrieve because I feel better holding the rod with my left when fighting a fish for some reason.  Maybe because holding a net with the right feels better?  Who knows.  Interesting that most big game saltwater reels are right retrieve.  But they are not casted. Re hunting, I went through most of my youth thinking I was really bad with a shotgun.  In my 30's someone on a goose trip asked me if I was left eye dominant.  I said ""Huh???"".  He told me to do the test.   Oops, I am left eye dominant.  So shooting a shotgun with both eyes open has me shooting way left of target.  Closed left eye and was a much better shot, but still not as natural as a right eye dominant shooter would be."
