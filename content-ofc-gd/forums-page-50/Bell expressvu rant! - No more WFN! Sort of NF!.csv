Dial up only and that doesn't work half the time.  Our phone keeps kicking in and out, can receive calls, but can't call out.  I have eliminated all our phone lines in the house and have one phone hooked up to where the line comes in the house trying to figure out the problem. Have had Bell out about a year ago and they didn't solve the problem. Have them coming again tomorrow and hopefully they find the problem this time. We have contacted numerous wireless companies and all want $1000 to put in a tower, not happening without guarantees, which they won't give. My neighbors have xplornet and they say it stinks most of the time. We are getting ripped off in Canada."

The Source store - owned by Bell - sells a very secret Turbo Hub service they do not really want anyone to know about so there is No published information on this. They only offer it so they can claim to CRTC and CCTS that they are offering Rural Canadians an affordable wireless home internet plan. You have to ask a store employee for it. There is no written material on the rate plan, the guy will write it on a scrap of paper and hook you up. It is only supposed to be sold for certain Postal Codes but that can be fudged. 100GB of data for $75/Month Still not unlimited but better than the $300-$400 overage charges that can be rung up on the Bell Wireless home internet hub on their ""stepped plan""  GL MIKE"

1039902,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-31 01:42:00,8243,"We have had Xplornet (no E before the X) satellite for about 6 years. The small square dish in on the railing on the deck facing the lake. We live right on the shore of Erie and that dish gets hammered with wind and snow, never had a problem. As I write this the SW winds are gusting to 80KPH. My wife couldn't make it into work this afternoon because of the whiteouts and has been on the laptop all day, not a problem. We don't stream much and was paying 75 bucks a month but never came close to maxing out, got them to drop it to $50 something a month.  We have had Bell TV here for 19 years. I was going to switch to Shaw when they had a great promo on. After reading what the bill would be after the promo was over the cost was going to be about 10 bucks a month less. Buddy down the lake switched to Shaw and regrets it due to interruptions but is staying. Somehow they share the bill  with 5 others. A quick tech question. I was told cable doesn't come in at 1080P Hi Def, it's less, true or false?  "
1039904,GBW,2019-01-31 02:15:00,8460,"A1.  Shaw will let you have up to 6 TV set top tv boxes active on 1 account so YES you have have up to 6 locations sharing a bill for 1 account.  Just don't tell them more info.  One is your house, the other is a cottage you visit that you own and 3rd is an RV and a single TV is there for temp use when travelling.  Any more info than that and a 2nd account at full pop price wise.  Legally Bell can do the same and offer up to 6 TV's of SAT service.  BUT they must all be SAT TV to do so and not the new FIBE (fiberoptics) as the two don't play well together, at ALL.  But for Bell if you lead on 1 is here and the other is here... they want full price for all locations.  Shaw doesn't (or didn't promote that for the past while as they too want more cash). So in short yes both Bell and Shaw can have 6 TV's on one account for SAT TV ONLY as long as they don't know they are in different area's.  Yes you need a dish per hook up too!  Oh, do not connect the phone/network line to the tv box if ever sharing as it tries to dial out to let Bell/Shaw know if you want a PPV and it will give away the TV Box location... A2. Depends on location (land/house/city) and TV set top box hardware.  Most is 1080i with a digital upscale to 1080p for cable.  If in an area offering true 4K tv via cable then yes 1080p but if not 1080i and the TV set top box does it best to produce it to 1080p.  *Edit to add*  part 2 to A1 of interruptions.  If watching TV on SAT (both Bell and Shaw) and the weather is causing the TV to pixilate (sp?) and not able to watch in a steady manner change to the SD channel vs the HD one.  Yes you will get the picture in SD but less likely to have many interruptions.  I can watch a show in SD in a snow and or rain storm and watch (well yeah may get the odd minor stop but nowhere close to in HD) it all while I can have a TV in the SAME house on the same show in HD and I can miss most of the show to the point of giving up and turning the tv off."

1039933,Old Ironmaker,2019-02-01 03:17:00,8243,"Thanks Geoff. I do switch to SD if the Hi Def starts to pixilate, a fancy tech word for going wonky. This past fall the HD was going in and out every few minutes. They waved the 75 banana service call and a sub contractor came out. Without checking a thing he said he knew what the problem was,100%. Large trees were causing the signal to go in and out as they swayed in the wind. Done, fini, finito, and off he went. Tree guy wanted 500 bucks to trim limbs 70 feet off the ground, oh my! The techie said it was going to be around $200.00 to move the dish. My adopted grandson (a pals kid) came a few days latter and climbed the ladder and tightened the HD connection on the dish. Bell called to ask how the service was. I said fine, I would never want to have a young fella with a young family lose his job. I was young once and knew everything that there is to know, I still am except the young part. Chong, why can't you get Shaw? I thought we were paying too much foe Bell until I saw what you are paying. We are paying Bell $120.00 for HD TV, Koodo $90.00 for 2 Smart phones, 1 with limited use, $58.00 to Xplornet for Internet. Around 270 all in."

The old story goes that a guy did just that and his wife decided to take the car to go shopping. She dragged him a few hundred feet down the road, he didn't make it. I was lambasted on another fishing forum because I didn't think it was an urban legend. The same goes for the guy that choked to death on a piece of wire from a piece of a BBQ brush used to clean the grill. I'm a Libra says my wife, whatever that means."
1039945,Fisherman,2019-02-01 17:54:00,7201,"Don't know if it's factual that the guy choked to death, bad if it is.  After reading about it about 2 years ago,  a quick inspection of my BBQ grills at the trailer confirmed that there were at least a dozen or so broken off stainless bristles that could have become embedded in the food being grilled.  The brush was garbaged and grills thoroughly cleaned."

Not too too clean as someone pointed out here once that crud is the tasty stuff. The thread about ""how do you clean your grill?"" turned into  Bell TV rant!!"

Cut the cable bill years back and never looked back. With a digital antenna and streaming I get by. The only thing that is annoying the amount of mouse clicks it takes to find a good game stream sometimes. I'm not a bell fan. My grandmother had a land line through Bell when she was alive. I used to call her daily. One day her phone was dead, I was living in a different city at the time. I called Bell for some help, after a serious run around through out of country call centers and zero compassion, I finally got someone on the phone to explain she hadn't paid her bill in months. I offered to pay it right there, and that was a hassle. Then I get.. we will reconnect within 48hrs. I explained she was 89 years old, lives alone with a condition, with no phone and needs to be able to call for help. No one I talked to 'managers' or 'supervisors' or anyone gave a S#@!$. Got hung up on a few times at the same call center. After hours of the worst people and support ever I finally got someone to speed up the reconnection. I told myself I would never ever consider Bell again. Stuck with Rogers who was more competitive generally anyways and I found had much better support. Yeah I know Virgin is owned by Bell which irks me. Still have a good distaste for Bell after bad experiences. But $30 month couldn't pass up."

What kills me is we want 1 channel and you get 6 more that we never watch. Bell Sat TV here, no cable, heck we don't have sidewalks and street lights. Our local In and Out store rents movies but they are all bad illegal copies that never work, usually die the last 10 minutes and I'm not driving a 70 minute return trip to return a movie, those are probably copies too. I was somewhere near here just outside Caledonia (you may guess where) where the guy was selling an old car. I walked into the trailer where they sell smokes and I see this lady with 2 DVD towers with about 10 slots in each copying DVD's and putting them into the movie DVD holders with all the graphics on them. She gave me a couple of movies to buy my silence I guess. I did the math, it evens out paying 7 bucks plus tax with fuel and time wasted. I must be worth 8 bucks an hour. OK 4. Come to think about it it's an hr to get the DVD and an hour to return it. They are probably counterfeit as well. Oh the joy of country living. 7 bucks is cheaper."

I have been subscribing to Expressvu for 13 years since moving here and pay almost $128 per month for a bunch of crap that I never watch.....just so that i could get a package that contains WFN (World Fishing Network). This month, they decide to abandon WFN for something they call the ""Sportsman"" channel. Unfortunately they dropped a whole lot of the fishing shows I watched, and substituted with a bunch of hunting shows! Nothing against hunting, but it is not my thing! They don't even have WFN available at any price!! I could of course download the shows on YouTube, but unfortunately, they limit us to 40GB of internet data for $60.00 per month! That is the maximum I can get (20 GB for $50 + $10 more for the second 20GB) Third world countries are getting better service for less money than we get in rural Ontario!! It is not like I live in some remote bush area, but right on a major highway! I am so sick of taking this abuse by these companies. Our Bell Bill for home phone, TV, Internet, and one cell phone is over $340.00 per month! My wife has a cell phone that is on another bell plan. Sigh.........I need an advil!"

Short story, because I don't have 3 services bundled anymore I loose a bunch of discounts and they recoup about 50 bucks of the anticipated savings I thought I would get. I get POed , loose it , probably said some things I shouldn't have, call Cogeco, get a Canadian  and work out a deal for unlimited internet, think it is a 60 gig connection, home phone retaining my present number , bunch of features and unlimited calling US and Canada long distance as my wife is from Florida and my stepdaughters and grandkids are there and 1 in Oregon, all for $104 a month, going to $140 or so after the year honeymoon is over, better than around 200 with Bell for basically the same package.  Between an android box and Cyberflix, 15 bucks for an IPTV package and the Toshiba TV in the livingroom does chromecast for the laptop sitting on the coffee table for youtube, we get all the Leafs, Raptors and Jays game, morning and evening news on CHCH and watch just about any show that was broadcast in the past 20 years.

1039731,GBW,2019-01-26 20:32:00,8460,"So, some of you may recall I worked for Bell on the home service sales team so please take some notes on how to save. 1st, shop the other options in your area so you can call the household loyalty team to sort out your current Bell situation before you cut them off.  Get the best rates from the others and then the ""on-going"" price after the promo.  Those rural have Shaw TV as an option. 2nd, check your TV that you have now (the name on the bill - good, better, best are pre-done channel line ups) and then get online and see the Current programming packages.  You can sign up for the 'good' and pay between $4-$7 a channel to add to any package.  Some people can survive with basic and 1 or 2 add on channels and cut the bill in a huge way. 3rd, if you are on a ""turbo hub"" internet plan via the cell towers then the odds are there is no DSL internet from Bell in the area via the phone line.  So yeah you are kind of stuck but you can see what the new up to date plans are too and make any changes up or down.  If DSL (phone line) internet is there and working then any plan other than a dial-up plan can be changed to a new package NAME and made unlimited. 4th, a trio of services with any brand of home service provider IS the best rates because they have nothing left to sell you so yes you get those 'bundle savings', legit. Now as for WFN, that's not Bell, Rogers, Shaw and others call.  The CRTC tell's them what they can and cannot have.  Some of it is also a contractual obligation.  WFN has been advertising since pre Christmas of the 'name change' and programming changes to come. Lastly, no matter how mad you are or may become while on the phone with a loyalty agent you are planning to cancel and go to company ABC for XYZ$$ unless they can do better.  Your call will be MUCH faster and easier the calmer you stay.  Trust me...  I got $427 back from Cogeco as I called often to report tv and or internet issues.  They had zero issue offering me that cash back and the manager that I was dealing with then thanked me many times for not being ""an irate caller who's had a LOT of service issues out of my control"". So if you are planning to leave ANY providers shop what you can get and cannot get and know the now and then prices as well as any terms and then make the call while nice and calm. Oh and when the auto recording picks up and you press ZERO over and over to get a live person you end up talking to sales who cannot and will not help at all.  You will more than likely be put on hold off and on upwards of 15 min before they even make the effort to get you where you need to be.  Just so you know... Have a good one and good luck."
1039753,Rattletrap2,2019-01-27 04:29:00,1652,"GBW, There are NO options! Bell has us by the you know whats! I have been hearing about how they are doing study after study to improve or provide high speed internet for 13 years now! Supposedly there were government incentives and what not but with the limited numbers of potential customers, they just can't be bothered to provide service. You can't tell me the technology is not available to give us high speed unlimited for a reasonable price? They just choose not to. The hub we have is a replacement for our old WiMax that they no longer support. They would not even give us a second hub for my wife to use. She had to go with something else for a hub and her plan starts at $60 for 5 GB of data and goes up from there. $100 to $120 a month is normal for her usage. Meanwhile anyone on DSL can get unlimited bandwidth for a fraction of the price we pay. They have cable in Orangeville and Shelburne, but we are almost exactly in the middle and get squat!"

That is insane. We have an antenna with a whopping 7 HD channels and use the wireless internet for Amazon Prime TV, YouTube and various streaming sites. Both of us were born and raised with cable and satellite TV so it was frustrating at first making the switch, but now we'd never consider going back to cable if we did move back into the city.  If you ditch cable there are websites with fishing content for low prices. Fishing TV is great and you can pay for only specific shows or you can watch everything (maybe 150 shows with multiple episodes each) for $99/year.   Many options for those who want to break free..."
1039757,Rattletrap2,2019-01-27 13:13:00,1652,"Thanks for the info ch312! I did look at Explornet back about 10 years ago, but the installation of a tower seemed insane. Another place out of Mount Forest area wanted to install a 100 foot tower at the north end of our property for who knows how much? They went out of business while I was thinking about it! lol I will take a look at the site you quoted. Thanks again!"
1039816,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-29 13:17:00,8243,I cancelled WFN years ago. They took $1.99 off the bill. The worse 2 bucks I ever spent.
1039819,canoecarrier,2019-01-29 14:44:00,54,"I believe bell owns the lines and rents them to the other companies. When I have an issue with my internet, bell has to come and I don't even have any bell services!"
1039844,Toronto_Angler,2019-01-29 20:38:00,698,With all the good fishing shows on Youtube now and the classic saturday morning global lineup I dont miss WFN at all!
1039849,HTHM,2019-01-29 23:05:00,4082,"I'm on an antenna, 33 hd digital channels. If I want to watch something, I can always stream it."
1039853,GBW,2019-01-30 01:07:00,8460,"Yes, depending on where the person is located.  Bell and cable companies (if avail.) will rent out the lines to provide an option to the customer.  That is, if it's available to even get via Bell or cable."
1039854,bigugli,2019-01-30 02:28:00,6138,Dropped Bell and their nonsense over 15 years ago. Smartest decision we could have made with phone TV internet.
1039867,Lape0019,2019-01-30 15:19:00,647,"I never paid for WFN. I would watch their free trials once in a while and noted that its was basically the same show over and over again for the month so never saw the appeal. Between You tube, waypoint TV and Bassmaster.com, I get pretty much all of the fishing related shows I could ever want. Living in the sticks sucks for actual internet service but there could be other options in your area. I am lucky enough to have teksavvy in my area (DSL through a Bell line but it works and is cheaper) but we also have explornet (everyone complains about them) and Storm just came into the area. It is satellite internet and the neighbours that have it, seem to like it better than the Explorenet package they had previously."
1039870,ch312,2019-01-30 15:46:00,1590," I've poured the concrete base for a tower and helped the guys erect the tower afterwards. It is a very simple process and it took less than a half hour from start to finish to put up the tower pieces with us taking our time and being cautious as none of us had done it before. The guy found the free tower on Kijiji and had his buddy climb and piece together the tower.  HTHM, what antenna are you running and is it on a tower? Most people think I am full of it when I tell them we watch HD on the antenna..."
1039880,smitty55,2019-01-30 19:25:00,928,Yea and it's better hd than through a dish where the signal is compressed for transmission. Unfortunately around here I can only get two hd channels.  Cheers
1039889,FILTHY OAR,2019-01-30 21:08:00,65,"cut the cord guys, had Bell for the land line and cogeco for tv and internet, all in $270, cut the cord to all...signed up with a new internet provider, 60mb speed and unlimited, $60 bucks, don't need the land line since we have cell phones, went and bought an android box for $80 bucks and signed up for IPTV for $15 month, I litterly have 500 or so channels ( and every channel Cogeco had + ) unlimited movies, so all in $75 a month, thats a savings of $195 a month.....and guys WFN is now the sportsman channel, has nothing to do with your provider."
1039890,FILTHY OAR,2019-01-30 21:11:00,65,Bell only owns the old copper phone lines. this is dial up and is the slowest means for internet.
1039895,GBW,2019-01-30 23:22:00,8460,"Yes, they own the copper lines BUT DSL internet is also run through that very same line.  You have to be close to what is called ""central office"" for Bell to offer DSL."
