667615,Raycaster,2012-02-17 23:48:00,528,"Have a trip planned for the May 24 weekend in Callander Bay but wondering about fishing options.  We will arrive on the Friday which is the 18th I believe but pike/wally open on the 19th? Not sure on the dates?   If the 19th is the opening do we just twittle our thumbs on the Friday (18th)?  Sorry for the noob question, usually don't head up till June atleast!"
667623,Fisherman,2012-02-18 00:13:00,7201,"If the 18th was the opener, then why would you twiddle your thumbs on the friday....but, it isn't, the opener is always the 3rd Saturday."
667664,Raycaster,2012-02-18 02:38:00,528," Sorry, I meant we will be there Friday May 18th and the 3rd Saturday is the 19th.  Perch?"
667665,Joeytier,2012-02-18 02:43:00,3990,You cannot fish Nipissing at all from March 16th until spring opener...
667668,kickingfrog,2012-02-18 02:49:00,8333, Bingo. Some guys head out at midnight. Not me however.
667670,tb4me,2012-02-18 02:52:00,3295,Its a grat time to get the heavy drinking out of the way...lol
667689,Nipfisher,2012-02-18 05:17:00,2449,"  Ya you have to wait until midnite....I'm usually passed out by then...lol. Lots of options though. You could fish Trout Lake, Nosbonsing, Talon, etc. All good fishing opportunities. Drinking heavy would be my choice.  I`ll be at the trailer waiting (drinking by the fire) for the walleye opener to go fish Silver Bass?????  Rod Caster are you in??????????? We are gonna slay them this year."
667695,Rod Caster,2012-02-18 12:00:00,5784," Sure buddy, I'll drink your beer.  I have a low traffic option for silver bass I'd like to try this year. All we need is my canoe. Should be epic. More details next time we chat!  To Raycaster: there is lots of good fishing around here beyond Nip. For the 18th, I'd recommend Nosbonsing or Wasi for walleye."
667903,Nipfisher,2012-02-19 18:38:00,2449,"Ratcaster, read the regs for Nipissing and be aware of the sanctuary from Burford's point to the shore past Wasi Falls. Doesn't open until June 1st."
