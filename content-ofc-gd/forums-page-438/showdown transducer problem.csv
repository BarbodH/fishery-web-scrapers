New ones are around 175 so he was told.  Does any one have an extra or spare or know where to go to get a cheaper replacement.  His g freind busted up his sle the same day.  first trip of the year for the sled as well he did not even get to ride it.  Thanks if you can help a brother out.  I think he need s break."
