668257,crossover,2012-02-20 20:33:00,172,"Does anyone have any experience with these lures? I need to stock up for some ice out GTA pike and was thinking of getting the most bang for my buck. Plus the damage is much lower when losing the lures. Hooks are obviously of cheap quality but you can easily change them.  http://www.basspro.c...10225045/129563 http://www.basspro.c.../10225056/85456 http://www.basspro.c...10225050/120234 http://www.basspro.c.../10225063/83316  Also on the topic of cheaper baits, can anyone recommend cheap inline spinners? I love mepps but they're a bit pricey."
668259,davey buoy,2012-02-20 20:43:00,5505,They always seem to have $2 bins of some sort.The price is right but I only buy what might catch my eye.The regular price would probably be in the 5-10$ range.Pike aren't fussy!
668261,mercman,2012-02-20 20:49:00,7054,"If you are looking for cheap, Walmart and CT offer generic ''Mepps'' spiners in 6 packs for under 10 bucks. Sail often has Storm hard baits on for 2.99-3.99, in big bins.Usually odd colors, but Pike will eat a popsicle stick if you fish it right"
668278,crossover,2012-02-20 21:32:00,172,"Yes lol, pike aren't the pickiest eaters. I'll pick up some of my favourite colours and post a report during ice out."
668283,paul_614,2012-02-20 21:54:00,168,Don't we have to have ice in first?
668285,mikeseb,2012-02-20 22:02:00,201, hahahahahah so true !
668338,krixxer,2012-02-20 23:41:00,274,"Got some 2$/pc from wally mart that have a LED inside. Got home, did the tub test and it all seemed good. Took them to the lake and sure enough the little LED turned on but it was just dead weight it in water, the action was horrible.  When I got back into fishing I found a few good kijiji adds just bought up a few lots."
668341,archer379,2012-02-20 23:45:00,277,Oddly enough that top water perch is my favorite top water change out the hooks and it works great for me. Don't ever remember buying it lol
668380,sleepjigging,2012-02-21 01:16:00,207,"These baits look like the ones that dollarama carries, just different colors."
668440,Snidley,2012-02-21 03:27:00,620,"I have owned that model of BPS hardbait and in my opinion they are junk. I would most definitely recommend the BPS XPS minnows, particularly the 3 1/2 inch floating stickbaits (the 4' ones are pretty good too). They are a knockoff of an old Yozuri bait and they catch everything from Bass, Walleye and Pike to Chinnooks and Steelhead. Their shad style bait is also very good. I also do very well with XPS Balsa Boogies for Chinnooks. If you wait for the BPS Spring Classic they are usually on sale either at the Vaughn Store or online. I've bought them for as little as $1.99 USD."
668454,adempsey,2012-02-21 04:51:00,1498,"Save your money.   Instead of buying a few of those low quality lures, get one good one.  We always buy way more than we need.   I know I do."
668567,crossover,2012-02-21 19:47:00,172,Can anyone recommend any reputable ebay sellers with cheap shipping (preferably Canadian?)
668786,outllaw,2012-02-22 12:22:00,1232,remember when you get crap chinese junk. i would buy 2 good lures opposed to a dollar store dis-appoinment.
668790,lew,2012-02-22 12:34:00,12766,It's always been my thinking that if you pay too a cheap price you may get a cheap product.  But that's just me.
