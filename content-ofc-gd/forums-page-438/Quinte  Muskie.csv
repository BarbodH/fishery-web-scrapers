668054,bucktail,2012-02-20 01:26:00,1857,I missed the talk about Quinte Muskie today and was wondering who on the board gives Quinte a shot for muskies?  When I was young muskies in the bay were not at a fishable level but I guess with the changing water quality it was become fishable.  Wondering if there were any typical patterns for them there now. Is it a trollers bite or a casters bite? I remeber a picture from the twenties of a stringer of 10 muskies from the bay.  The old bridge used to be a hot spot for muskies.    Darren
