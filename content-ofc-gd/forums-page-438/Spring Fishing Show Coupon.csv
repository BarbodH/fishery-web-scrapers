667331,Joeytier,2012-02-17 01:59:00,3990,"I was under the impression that this show was free....  Do you think Radioworld's booth will make it worth the price of admission for me?  I'm looking to buy a flasher, so I figure this will be the place to find the best price, but after gas + admission I'm starting to wonder?"
667334,danbouck,2012-02-17 02:02:00,4380, If you are only going for that just go to the store. But it is a great place to spend the day.
667373,Joeytier,2012-02-17 03:07:00,3990,"I've been twice before a few years ago, just never with any intentions of making a large purchase.  The highlight both years were the vendors and their jerky at the front."
667632,d_paluch,2012-02-18 00:41:00,343,thanks! Just what I was looking for!  The money saved will get me 1 bottle of water (ridiculous)
