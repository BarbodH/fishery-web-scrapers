Love to fish for BASS, walleye, perch. Not a big trolling guy but do have equipment. Live relatively close by as well.  Bill"
668734,NAW,2012-02-22 02:29:00,4022,I've been on this board for a few years now.  And that is the most well organized plea for a fishing partner I've ever seen!  I don't fit your criteria.. But I'm sure you'l find someone willing to tag along for a few weekends.  But if you're ever heading to Simcoe for a troll and need a partner.  Fire me a PM!  I might have a hole in my schedule.
