Irwin )  Took a look around, seems that Smallmouth bass, Lake Trout and White fish (and perch) are the main fish in the lake.  has anyone fished it? is it any good?  What are the best tactics for summer months for whitefish and/or Lake trout?  Looks like the max depth is found in a couple sections of the lake around 120 - 150 ft deep with some good areas in the 30 - 50 ft range...  rocky shoals and plenty of shallow bays in the 3 - 5ft mark.. which I estimate will be weeded up come summer.   I enjoy fishing for smallmouth of course, but since I'm comfortable flippin my tubes and spinners around islands and points / drop offs for them...  My main curiosity is how to target the whitefish and / or laketrout in the summer months."

668575,cityfisher,2012-02-21 20:14:00,959,have a place in the area...the last couple years have been REALLY tough through the ice...to the point most are not bothering with it. Last year we had 5 guys running and gunning for 2 days... ended up with 1 3lb trout.. other local guys said the same  In the summer ive only targeted bass and there is a decent population.. Mostly in the 1-2lb range
