668387,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-21 01:29:00,698, Glad to see that you find drinking and boating a laughing matter
668393,Twocoda,2012-02-21 01:37:00,4130, dont sweat it toronto angler....the pony pee the americans drink is equivelent to three week old apple juice up here in the land of men....
668456,bramptonjerry,2012-02-21 05:04:00,132,"I'm glad I got mine and the one for my 12 year old when I did, it's really just another tax, there's no registry, if you lose your card and you don't have your original pin number you're outta luck so for the 15 kms we fish I was lucky to do it back years ago, I won't let him go out by himself yet, but he can drive with my supervision.  It's really just another tax on small boaters and fisherman you will learn to navigate the waters you travel...coarse or not."
668460,GYPSY400,2012-02-21 09:35:00,191,"I passed mine last year using the online 3 hour test ( one day before picking up my new boat - D'oh!). I found it to be mostly common sense stuff, although I've been driving a boat since I was 5...  I still don't know the buoy thing, but I'm rarely on big water."
668467,Billy Bob,2012-02-21 10:36:00,5865, What I find is the whole system is a laughing matter as Roy as already pointed out.....BTW I'm 1000% sure I'm more qualified as a boater then you will ever be....and I'm not even going to call you a  Bob...
668468,Billy Bob,2012-02-21 10:38:00,5865, Actually I a devoted Labatt's drinker.......they sell so much here that Labatt's opened up a corporate office here in the Buffalo area....
668193,Gregoire,2012-02-20 14:53:00,1397,"I'm not arguing that I do not need to know what the masthead is, rather I am trying to make the point that not many boaters who have their boating card will have any idea what this is. I am just frustrated that I have to go through this process."
668194,mercman,2012-02-20 15:00:00,7054,"Well, at least we dont have to get a learners permit for a year, then pass a driving test with an instructor.Although judging by the idiots i saw on the water last year, it would be an excellent idea. When i did the test, i was surprised to note, that when i failed a module, the questions got harder to answer"
668195,Cudz,2012-02-20 15:15:00,2652,The exam got way more difficult.  A colleague of mine said she had to go online and study for 2 hours (or allow 2 hours to pass) before she was able to sit the test.
668196,Gregoire,2012-02-20 15:37:00,1397,Definitely way harder than I ythough it would be. The module tests are very complicated questions thay are far too detail oriented in my opinion. Hopefully I'll be done module 7 in a few minutes and will pass the module test so that I can write the real test.
668199,smally21,2012-02-20 15:40:00,993,"I don't see that question, nor requiring knowledge of it to be ridiculous at all. More than half of that question is simply 'can you speak boaters lanquage'. Which, if you want to be a boater, you should ba able to do. Not to mention if you are piloting a boat at night interpreting the meaning of the mysterious white light comIng at you might not seem so ridiculous when it's at 20metres"
668200,woodenboater,2012-02-20 15:42:00,2277,"I guess the problem for us is that the card is meant for a broad range of boaters whereas we're probably going out in tinnies on inland waters and not navigating busy lanes. Regardless, I think, overall, this card was destined to happen and also agree with Roy re: Power Squadron. If one is looking to truly learn about boating, this would be the course.   Glad I took my test in person last year and am encouraging SWMBO to get her card this year so she can drive. and yeah, reading the material over and over helped alot"
668207,pikehunters,2012-02-20 16:04:00,40,"Had to do the same back in the 90's here in PA. We actually had to take a 2 day course & then a test, not sure about todays regulations. A group of us got  together & went through the process just to make it fun. I look at this the same  as taking the motorcycle safety course didn't have to do it but if you pick up one  little thing that may help or even save a life it is worth it. Trust me next time on the water you will see something that was on  the test & you'll say Ha!"
668209,lew,2012-02-20 16:09:00,12766,"Sure sounds as if things have become alot more complicated since I took mine at the Sportsman Show the 1st year they became available, maybe 10 years or so back. Never even heard of these modules everyones talking about.  Seems to me there were only about 20 questions and if you passed it was $10"
668210,Billy Bob,2012-02-20 16:12:00,5865," Oh, I was going to say my fishing partner's head lamp as he bent over to get another beer out of the cooler...."
668212,Gregoire,2012-02-20 16:28:00,1397," I don't disagree that you should know that the light comming at you is on a boat, I just find the phrasing to be poor. By the way I just wrote and passed the test 98% I wonder which question I got wrong."
668214,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-20 16:33:00,698,  Judging by your constant posts of drinking on a boat..Probably a good idea to bring in testing down there!
668215,Billy Bob,2012-02-20 16:40:00,5865," Oh, I'm pretty sure I would pass the drinking test if need be...."
668216,cheaptackle,2012-02-20 16:49:00,849,"I did mine in May 2010 at Bass Pro in the classroom.  Couple of hours start to finish, got one wrong.  Figured for the extra money (think it was 75.00 total) it was worth it as I was pretty confident they would be teaching you to pass it. I did learn more than what I already knew without a doubt.  Now if I ever do see a ""bifurcation buoy"" I hope I remember what the hell I'm supposed to do about it Don't want to overly upset the apple cart but maybe the time HAS come for a graduated system like with driver's licenses.  Face it, they are trying to make the waters safer, but it's going to take time before a formula is found to cover all the bases, and the journey is going to be a little rough along the way.  Michael"
668220,mercman,2012-02-20 17:08:00,7054, SEE!!!! I told you you would pass. Congrats Yer now a sea Captain!!!AAARRRRRRRRR
668230,Roy,2012-02-20 18:13:00,13728,"I don't agree that having a boater's card makes the waters safer at all. There will always be accidents no matter how many tests you take or how much knowledge you have. An accident is just that. There are avoidable tragedies cause by people drinking or people just not being careful. Then of course there are a few people who are just plain too scatterbrained to drive any kind of a vehicle on public roads or waterways. The cards were not put in place to make the waterways safer. They were a stop gap measure to get people, mostly on PWC off the water. They started with the PWC then every couple of years expanded it to include longer and longer boats 'til we got to where we are today. Almost everyone has a card, there is no central registry for the card and with or without a central registry, the card is still a useless measure. One blatant example is that people who've had their own boat on the water for 40 years need a card...folks who are renting a boat for the very first time, don't need a card. Where's the logic there? There is none. I could go on but it's not worth it. You cannot legislate common sense. Stupid people will cause accidents with or without a card. And the accidents (in the true sense of the word) will happen even between two very knowledgeable boaters."
668231,misfish,2012-02-20 18:24:00,29133," Ok, that was funny."
668235,lew,2012-02-20 18:36:00,12766,Well said Roy.
668242,smally21,2012-02-20 19:34:00,993,"Kind of my point. The 'phrasing' you object to is taken from the definition, not some made up question. It's boat speak for forward facing light.  But from your comment I see you still don't know what it means. Congrats on your 98 sounds like you are good to go!"
668302,Live2fish85,2012-02-20 22:30:00,1633,You didn't really save money from doing it at the show as you have to pay again. You saved $10 on the second round and if you read the info for the  test online it says you get 2 chances for online.  I read the book and passed first time around. Really didn't need it as its common sense really but congrats on passing.
668315,Twocoda,2012-02-20 22:58:00,4130,i did mine at the fishing show in the early 90s....20 bucks ...two tries...i got two questions wrong....one was...WHY Should you wear a pfd ? my answer was ...because its the law...lol...when the correct answer was....because it will save your life.....(debatable i thought but whatever....ever seen a dead guy in a floater suit?)....the second one i got wrong was...what is a cordual buoy....to this day....i know what one looks like (yellow /black/yellow_ but havent got a clue as to what it represents...  Congrates on your pass!
668322,Roy,2012-02-20 23:06:00,13728," Yellow black are not ""cordual"", they are cardinal buoys indicating cardinal point directions."
668326,Twocoda,2012-02-20 23:16:00,4130, no wonder i got it wrong....i thought cardinals would be red
668330,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-20 23:24:00,10439, It depends what church they belong to.
668331,Twocoda,2012-02-20 23:28:00,4130,"that explains it better....ive never belonged to one of them ""clubs"""
668350,Ralph Field,2012-02-21 00:11:00,1018,I waited until I sold my boat to get mine. That doesn't make me sound overly smart does it ?
668062,Gregoire,2012-02-20 01:52:00,1397,"After putting off getting a pleasure craft card for years I finally bit the bullet and want to take the test today at the fishing show. After no prep and taking 15 minutes to write the exam I ended up with a 35 out fo 50...not a pass. It turns out I saved money by not passing as it costs less to take the test online. I think I found out why. Now either module 1 is really tough, or the double chocolate stout that I am drinkng is more potent than I thought, but I am on my 4th attempt at module 1 and I keep doing worse. Being a teacher I am starting to feel for my students who do poorly on tests. I am at my witts end. Pretty soon I will stop forwarding and actually do the readings."
668064,Gregoire,2012-02-20 01:55:00,1397,Oh and 25 minutes to do the readings...even if I were to have to learn brail and read the pages it wouldn't take so long. By the time I can take the practice test I have forgotten everything...stupid ADD.
668066,Gregoire,2012-02-20 01:55:00,1397,Still 8 minutes till I can take the test
668070,mercman,2012-02-20 02:06:00,7054,"10 bucks, i'll do it for ya                  JUST KIDDING EVERYONE"
668071,Roy,2012-02-20 02:08:00,13728,"When I wrote mine I got 91%. That's 33 of 36 correct answers. I know that one answer was dead wrong and the other two were very debatable. The bottom line for me is that the card is necessary to drive a boat but it sure as heck doesn't make you a better boater. All of the accidents that you hear about these days..guess what, they all passed their boaters test. No folks, you can't legislate common sense. Oh, and guess what else..there's no central registry for that."
668075,Gregoire,2012-02-20 02:13:00,1397,I just passd module 1..and Merc if I was in Montreal I would give you 20
668079,mercman,2012-02-20 02:24:00,7054,  Congrats on Module 1  Who is gonna witness it for you?........5 bucks more
668084,Gregoire,2012-02-20 02:34:00,1397,no witness needed for the boatsmart anymore...at least that is what I was told. If I am wrong I'll just use my girlfriend. I do not feel good about module 2
668086,mercman,2012-02-20 02:40:00,7054,You can do it.  Just let common sense take over your answers. 90% of the test is/was comon sense the rest was buoys and regulations.
668090,Tybo,2012-02-20 02:50:00,1373,Like the common sense of. I HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY
668095,NAW,2012-02-20 03:02:00,4022,No offence.. But how can you fail these tests.  Get the book.  read it a few times.  Study!!!  Then write the exam.  No problem.?
668096,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-20 03:02:00,10439,"I did the test at The Spring Fishing show a million years ago now. I borrowed a copy of the book right there, did a 5 or 10 minute read through and got 33 out of 36. But I was a pretty good boater before hand. Y'all can call me Cap'n."
668108,Gregoire,2012-02-20 03:23:00,1397,I did not read the book beforehand. I am guessing that most people would not pass the module tests without studying. You need an 8/10 for each module before you can move on. On a positive I am done module 3
668132,Gregoire,2012-02-20 04:00:00,1397,Failed module 4...I'm calling it a night. This test not relevant and overly detailed in it's nature.
668144,Dozer,2012-02-20 05:56:00,896,"Youre a teacher? Fantastic, talk with your class and ask them how to cheat, it will save you a lot of grief"
668146,adempsey,2012-02-20 06:09:00,1498,The whole process became more difficult with the changes they made last year.    The exam is not as much of a joke as it used to be.  Glad I got mine when I did.

668174,registerfly,2012-02-20 13:40:00,198," yes took me 3 tries to pass last spring. 50 questions and need 80%. Buddy who took it previously also felt it was much more difficult than his version. taking it online you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can even proceed to the next section, mandated so called apparently thinking you will study that much more prior."
668177,Roy,2012-02-20 13:52:00,13728,"If you want to be getting anything at all out of it, the best way is to go to a Canadian Power and Sail Squadron near you and take the course. You'll learn a heck of a lot more than doing the multiple choice answers in the online tests."
668188,Gregoire,2012-02-20 14:27:00,1397,"Example of the most rediculous question yet: ""what is the name of the white navigation light that shows in an unbroken light over an arc of 225 degrees dead ahead and 22.5 degrees abaft on both sides of the vessel"""
668190,Roy,2012-02-20 14:40:00,13728," Practically speaking, not many of us would ever need that light but we should know what it is."
