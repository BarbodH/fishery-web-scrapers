With the help of our 77 volunteers we were able to welcome a record attendance for the event. Over 1000 people enjoyed a free family fun day outside ice fishing. Every kid got a prize and even some of the adults.  A fun day was had by all and lots of fish were caught.  On behalf of the families that enjoyed a great day on the ice, thank you volunteers.   This is a picture of OFC member Ron towing in some of the Frabill village at the end of the day. Lot's of ""first fish"" caught in those huts at the event.   Here is a link to the Peterborough Examiner article about the festival.  http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3476953"
