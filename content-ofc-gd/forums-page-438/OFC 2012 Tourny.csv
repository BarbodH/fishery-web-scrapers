666966,bigugli,2012-02-16 03:33:00,6138,I'll stand to as a captain again.
666967,vinnimon,2012-02-16 03:37:00,2593,"  Thats awesome joey  Im in as to a team member, I wish to be a captain but I dont have the time as of yet  So count me in , the salmonoids are waiting"
666968,GBW,2012-02-16 03:39:00,8460,"Good on ya Joey and I'm sure many agree when I say THANKS!  If you fall short on a Cap, I can do it.  Just rather let someone else have a chance."
666974,Leecher,2012-02-16 03:46:00,7832,That's great Joey    You da man woo woo woo  I'll be glad to take part as a player in any team
666977,Live2fish85,2012-02-16 03:47:00,1633,Way to go Joey. As GBW said if you need a Captain I will help step up. I haven't been here very long and only been in the tournament for a year but I eould gladly help out.
666979,manitoubass2,2012-02-16 03:50:00,11391,"Either team member or captain, I can't wait to take part again!  "
667050,Acountdeleted,2012-02-16 14:19:00,2562,What are the names of the topics of the previous years fishing tourneys? I'd love to look over them and see what I'm in store for this year.
667166,bigugli,2012-02-16 19:45:00,6138,There is an entire subforum dedicated to the OFC tournies  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showforum=44

667315,grt1,2012-02-17 01:20:00,638,"sign me up again Joey, the wife love it when i show her my sign in my fish pictures, she thinks i'm nuts but gets a chuckle at the fun I have with the hunt for the big fish for the tourney"
667345,Carp,2012-02-17 02:14:00,1488,I'm in.
667445,Acountdeleted,2012-02-17 12:59:00,2562," Whoops, thanks. I normally don't scroll past the classified."
667544,limeyangler,2012-02-17 20:20:00,5204,Awesome Joey....WTG!  I'll be on any team that wants me!
667549,Joey,2012-02-17 20:28:00,9122,"We'll be having a sign up thread shortly and a ""who wants to be a captain"" thread aswell.  Just waiting to get everything set up in a 2012 tourney forum.  Patience Grasshoppers"
667593,GBW,2012-02-17 22:37:00,8460,"Like I said, if you fall short PM me and I'll help out."
668116,Joey,2012-02-20 03:33:00,9122,"Okay, the new sign up thread is up and running, lets keep the possible captains and sign up roster going there if we can.  The sooner we sign up, the faster we can get the teams assembled.  I have listed 7 captains at this point and if anyone else would really like to be one, speak up now!  HERE is the sign up thread.  Joey"
663121,bigugli,2012-02-03 03:32:00,6138,"Seeing as we are into February, the question needs be asked.  Will we have another year long OFC team tournament? Last we heard, Slowpoke had already announced he could no longer co-ordinate the game. Will someone step up to the plate? Is there enough interest amongst the members?"
663122,danbouck,2012-02-03 03:35:00,4380,I think there will be lots interested in participating but whomever organizes it needs to have a lot of free time to handle it.  I don't have time to even be a captain this year
663125,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-03 03:44:00,1622,"I would still stand as a captain again but that's it for me, still not positive what lies ahead SBK"
663126,Frank,2012-02-03 03:53:00,74,"I've never took part before, but would love too this year, if possible."
663149,bigugli,2012-02-03 09:26:00,6138,"I have the time, only thing is I'm not the sharpest crayon when it comes to puter skills.  When I went to school computer science was a nerd class, where you messed around with 10000 punch cards to produce a 2 minute program."
663199,Rod Caster,2012-02-03 13:32:00,5784, Haha Classic! I am also looking forward to seeing how this pans out.
663202,lew,2012-02-03 13:43:00,12766," Jeeez Bruce, your really making me feel old now.  When I was in school we were sticking girls pigtails in the ink wells in the corner of our desks."
663203,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-03 13:44:00,2690," Not that I'm nearly as old as you, BU   BUT, I remember something similiar from way back. All those nerds back then are making mega-bucks now...had we only known  Back to the true subject of the post.  If it happens, good luck to the guy/gal that runs it.  Brian put alot of time and work into it."
664972,mercman,2012-02-09 17:45:00,7054,"I had a great time on the winning team last year Would love to enter again. It does require tons of coordination though. It would practically have to be someone retired, who would donate his time to this fun competition. I hope some will take over the reins from Slopoke, who BTW, did a bang up job on the last one"
664986,mike rousseau,2012-02-09 18:49:00,4661,Why not just have everyone keep their pictures and measurements till the end of the year... And everyone post on a thread once and only once their numbers... As individuals...  No OFC sign required... Cause that makes it a hassle... And a lot of people forget it...and no bonus inches...  It would be interesting to see how many well rounded multi species anglers are out there...  Same species as the regular ofc tourney...
665000,Live2fish85,2012-02-09 19:30:00,1633,Sorry Bruce. I didn't see this post before. I hope we get it going soon as well. As for individual I think it was cool with the teams and te sign is needed I think. Just is proof that it was caught this year. It is not anyones fault but themselves if its forgot. I had a bunch in each of my tackle boxes in a zip lock bag even my back pack for doen at the Niagara or where ever I was hiking.  Mike I do agree though with not having bonus inches they were a pain as half the time they didn't post them for a month or so.
665047,GBW,2012-02-09 21:50:00,8460,"I'm out as a captain but willing to be on a team.  I know it's time consuming but I think if you get a copy of the excel file from Brian it can be done because everthing is already there.  and YES, SKIP the bonus inches...."
665187,camillj,2012-02-10 03:09:00,1988,Im in ... but need to know which team Im fishing for so I can make up my sign .... soooon
665195,Acountdeleted,2012-02-10 03:35:00,2562,"I'm not sure how this works but it sounds like fun. I'd love to be in.    As an asside can I post pictures of the fish we catch through electrofishing from my work?  I kid I kid. No cheating here, only fish caught with hook and line."
665302,mikeseb,2012-02-10 16:13:00,201,After reading the threads from the past too tournys Id love to participate if we have one this year.

666640,Roy,2012-02-15 12:01:00,13728," Yup, information on a 2012 tourney will be up soon and if enough interest is shown, one will be started."

666839,Fisherpete,2012-02-15 22:51:00,1814,"I will gladly captain a team again in 2012! (Weeeeeeeeee are the champions, my friends... we'll keep on fishing till the end...!) The tourney is a blast!  Here's my two cents... OFC signs should stay in, and so do the bonus inches. If you forget the sign, your bad! Let your team members razz you about it! And it is not hard at all to send in the pics to the OFAH Angler Awards program... they seem to have worked out some of the bugs on their site.  If somebody else wants to take the lead on running the tourney, I might be able to help in some capacity - but hopefully somebody steps up and runs it just as well as Brian did.

666842,spincast,2012-02-15 23:03:00,3279,"Count me in. 2010 champ shirt is still one of the ""lucky' fishin' shirts - well, maybe its not actually - didnt even get one on the board for the team last year  All the more reason to try out again in 2012."
666844,backbay,2012-02-15 23:22:00,773," Lol, and I bet the only thing bigger than the computer, (which, in my experience, batched all our cards at night), was the air conditioning room to keep it cool!"
666862,Roy,2012-02-16 00:35:00,13728,Joey will be running the tourney this year. I'm sure she'll do a fantastic job.
666892,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-16 01:25:00,1622,"  Good for you Joey, if needed I will be a Captain this year, my fishing was limited last year mostly Bass, hopefully better this year Thanx & Tight Lines SBK "
666946,Joey,2012-02-16 02:36:00,9122,"Thanks, I'm gonna get things up and running soon, just been going over the old format etc., but anyone who wants to be a Captain, just let me know.  SBK, you are one now"
