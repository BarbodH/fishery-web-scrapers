Hope you all get out to do some fishing of course as it is perfect out right now, at least in my Mississauga backyard. Sun on the deck, feels like plus 2 out right now, and my smoker smoking away with a 10lb brisket.  share your catches of the day and bring your kids out. or whatever you plan on doing let us know. Could go for a ride it's so damn nice out ATM. Simcoe was fun Saturday, tons of perch but that storm in the AM was ridiculous, as was the walk back with the fresh thick snow.  Cheers Henry"

Sun was out, temps were mild, snow fights were often haha. My only complaint is the traffic on Temag, but I solved that by going to another lake haha."
