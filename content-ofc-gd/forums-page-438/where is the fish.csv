668412,sleepjigging,2012-02-21 02:14:00,207,"Went out Sunday 19th to Minet's point. Ice was 5-6"" with 3"" water on top of it and 2 inches snow on top of that.  Got 1 Herring at 73'. Released. Moved around for a couple of hours, but could not find any fish after about 7 holes. (A)  Went closer to shore to find some perch. Found them in about 45'. (B ) All dinks. Found the bottom to be like the diagram.  Saw schools of something on the sonar suspended 16'-30'. (D) Tried live minnows , but they were very light biters, and stole the minnows mostly. I can feel a bite pretty good, even on little dink perch, but these suspended guys were either smaller than that or softer (like little gobies - but I know gobies don't suspend, and not like smelt - because I have caught smelt before, and they are aggressive when they strike). Any thoughts on what these suspended fish are : perch/crappie/smelt...  So where are the fish usually? People often say ""fish the drop off"" - do they mean at B,C,D,E (at the edge of the underwater cliff) or F? "
