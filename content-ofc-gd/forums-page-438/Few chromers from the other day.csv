The day started of very slow with not even a strike in the first 2 hours!  I was thinking of giving up for the day and trying the next ... good thing i didn't!!LOL I ended up going 2-5 on the day loosing 2 fish due to my drag being to tight  Im still trying to get the hang of this new drag-on-top reel but by the end of the day I had it down.  My buddy lost what would have been his second steelhead ever, a 10#+ monster hen, to a log jam as well  Overall it was still a great day as I got to wet a line and got into some steel.  We ended up fishing well after dark with no action once it go really dark, but we though we'd give it a shot.  Will float fishing still produce after dark? or should we be casting loud and bright hardware once the sun goes down?   The only fishing ive done at night was for bass with loud rattling crankbaits.  I had a chat with another guy on the river who was trying to convince me a certain trib west of toronto saw a run of lake trout this fall and was saying him and his son caught a combined 7 in one day!!! I didnt believe a word he said and wanted to call shenanigans but that would be wasting valuable time reserved for fishing  Thanks for reading  "
