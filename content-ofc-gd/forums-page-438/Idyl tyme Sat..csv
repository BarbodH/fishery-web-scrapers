They just moved them the day before, got out for about 7am. wanted to make sure we got the morning bite.(seems sometimes thats the only bite of the day) By 9am landed 4 Walleye, 2 in the slot(released quickly), a few perch and 1 herring. Most were had on a jig/minnow. Stuck it out till about 5. Got a few more Perch over the day and thats about it. Yep just a morning bite. Gotta thank Idle tyme once again. They have to be one of the best out there on Nip.  On another note was heading up to Sudbury last Fri. on HWY17 and what did i see, a big advertising sign for OFC. Very nice to see. Hope to see more out there."
668406,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 02:00:00,5784,Seems the morning bite has trumped the evening bite as of late. I'm suprised the perch bite wasn't great during the day... Still it sounds like a great trip!
668408,Nipfisher,2012-02-21 02:01:00,2449,  Why did you leave before the late bite???? Usually starts around 5:40 pm  this time of year. Buddies were out a few weekends ago and only caught perch all day. Then in 20 minutes at prime time they caught 5 walleye. kept 4 as one was too small.
668416,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 02:34:00,8333,Do you know where the huts were moved relative to the previous spots? Do you know what depth you were fishing?
668419,Bassnbows,2012-02-21 02:36:00,58, Buddy comes and picks everyone up out there in his day huts between 5-6.
668424,Bassnbows,2012-02-21 02:43:00,58,"Not too sure where they were before bud, i don't think they were too far. He likes to keep them somewhat close to his bungalows i guess. We were fishing about 32"" of water."
668426,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 02:45:00,8333,"Thanks, I was out with them in January and plan on going up in March."
668435,Bassnbows,2012-02-21 02:57:00,58,"If your looking at the bungalows, i believe he may be booked till the end of the season. Day huts should'nt be a prob. And just a heads up, bring some medium minnows if u can, most of the one's he has a pretty big this year."
668728,Joeytier,2012-02-22 02:20:00,3990,"That's some slow fishing.  Usually Shawn's huts are more productive than that.  Good to hear you had a good time, regardless."
