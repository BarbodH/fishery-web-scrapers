667814,NAW,2012-02-19 03:06:00,4022,"Wow..  Bruzer.  One guy looks like he's wearing chest waders, and the other a wet suite??"
667864,fishnsled,2012-02-19 15:17:00,3520,"So that's the secret for BIG pike, it's all in the foot wear or lack of it.  Monster fish!"
667874,Joey,2012-02-19 16:00:00,9122,"Certainly an interesting choice of ice fishing clothes, on both of them.  Nice fatty pike tho, and they seem to have their method of weighing and keeping the fish alive down pat"
667896,darsky,2012-02-19 18:14:00,586,Well now-another good use for an IKEA bag.
667900,NARDA1,2012-02-19 18:23:00,6,Nice Pike!! I can't believe that guys walking around barefoot like it's the middle of summer.

668226,misfish,2012-02-20 18:00:00,29133,It was out of the slot size.LOL  Good on them for the release.  I have enough problems with getting my gloves wet and freezing.
