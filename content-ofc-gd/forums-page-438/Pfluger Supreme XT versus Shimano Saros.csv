668384,solopaddler,2012-02-21 01:26:00,8605,The previous generation is not as good.
668386,Gregoire,2012-02-21 01:28:00,1397, Going from Abu to Pflueger is like going from a Pontiac to a Chevy
668389,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 01:31:00,5784," Yes, but I paid 140 for the Soron, the Supreme is on for 80... But since its the older generation at that price, I'll pass on it. I just thought it was a great deal."
668390,Gregoire,2012-02-21 01:34:00,1397, I meant that they are both built by the same company. At similar price points you are basically getting the same thing with a different label
668391,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 01:36:00,5784," I didn't know they had the same parent company. Still, 80 vs. 140 is definitely not the same price point."
668399,salmon,2012-02-21 01:42:00,334,I believe this is the one http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Pflueger_Supreme_XT_Spinning_Reel/descpage-PPCRS.html  IMO really should be compared to the Stradic CI4  I have the Supreme XT and the reel wobbles quite a bit using crankbaits but on a wacky worm system it is great. I have it on my Avid rods and the wooble drives me crazy. My CI4 and my daiwa Tierras do not wobble Anyone want to buy it LOL Jose
668443,Snidley,2012-02-21 03:47:00,620,"The gold one in the picture is a Supreme XT from 2 years ago. I have one and its a great reel but except for the thick bail (like a Diawa air bail) it is the same as the plain Supreme, which is also a great product. My only complaint with the reel is that the clicker on all 5 of my Supremes failed. The drag still worked but it seemed strange watching a Chinnook pull off 200 feet of line without a sound on a spin reel. Pure Fishing did send replacement spools so all is now good. $76 is a great price for the Supreme XT, I paid $99 for mine. FFO-Tackle.com has the plain Supreme for $68 less whatever discount they offer that day BUT shipping can be expensive from them. All my reels are 40 size and they don't make the Patriarch in that size or I would be tempted to try one. For the price you would pay $200 for Shimano of a comparable quality and that reel  would weigh significantly more, not being a magnesium reel and all. FFO gets Sorons all the time as well, but they are not magnesium reels to my knowledge. The range from $60 to $80 over there depending on the bering count."
668447,Grimace,2012-02-21 03:59:00,2020,"I have my Pflueger on an avid and it is the ultimate jigging and lindy rig set up for Walleyes.  The lightweight reel makes it feel like the only thing you are holding is the rod.  You can feel any bite.  Slack bite, inhale bite, you can feel them all.  I would never sit here and slag  Shimano, they are awesome reels.  Their customer service is VERY good and you can get parts for them, however I feel that Pflueger is getting an unfair shake as for the toughness factor.  I pound the piss out of all my tackle and have no problem calling out duds.  I have had no problem with the durability of Pflueger so far and I bash my stuff around pretty good.  There are going to be complaints on all rigs.  The gent with the Shimano reel with the noise is the exception not the rule.  The gentleman with the Pflueger that broke in one shot is the exception not the rule.  It basically comes down to this.  They are both high quality reels.  Pfluegers are lighter.  Shimanos have the best customer service.  You will probably never need to call customer service with either.   Edge goes to Pflueger."
668770,Mike the Pike,2012-02-22 04:38:00,3421,I love my Shimanos especially my Stradic 4000 but I bought a Pflueger President 3500 2 summers ago and I absolutely love it.  My favorite for sure so light and smooth.  Great bang for the buck.
667852,gordy28,2012-02-19 14:45:00,638,"Hey there, Interested in opinions between the two reels The Supreme XT is on sale at BPS-$30 which makes it the same price as the Saros. Will be used on a 7 foot ML rod Plan is to use it for rigging, spinners and topwater-so will most likely sppol with high end mono  Just interested in people opinions re quality-I have 2 Shimano reels-never used a Pflueger  Thanks Gordy"
667854,BillM,2012-02-19 14:48:00,17367,"I use my Saros 1000 for everything.  Specs, walleye, icefishing, etc..  Hasn't let me down yet, wouldn't trade it in for a Pfluger."
667856,ohhenrygsr,2012-02-19 15:00:00,947,It's $30 less? which makes the reel how much?  I love my Supreme's
667862,Live2fish85,2012-02-19 15:16:00,1633,Supremes all the way.
667866,solopaddler,2012-02-19 15:21:00,8605,"I've been a Shimano guy when it comes to spinning reels for many years.  Not anymore.   I bought 2 Supreme XT reels earlier this year and love them to death. Super smooth and way lighter than the Shimano.  I got mine for under $100 shipped after shopping around. IMO it's the best value for your dollar currently on the market.  Just as nice as the some of the higher end Shimanos and less than half the price. Waaay nicer than the Saros, it's not even close."
667869,gordy28,2012-02-19 15:47:00,638, $129  solopaddler I dont believe that price exists on E bay anymore Cheapest I can see is $130 ish  Thanks for the feedback guys- looks like the Supreme is the winner so far Gordy
667913,NANUK,2012-02-19 18:58:00,797,"  Solo, have you used the Supreme XT for steelhead ? how does it hold up on the tribs? line lay on the spool, casting small lures and most importantly the drag?  I am old fashioned and still like my Daiwa Whiskers when fighting those silver bullets,  was thinking of trying something a little modern for a change, Thanks"
667916,solopaddler,2012-02-19 19:08:00,8605,"  Not yet but I will soon. I'm in the process of ordering one in the 40 size for steelhead and will put it through it's paces.  No doubts on my part that it'll be great, the other two smaller versions I've got are fantastic."
667928,Sinker,2012-02-19 19:41:00,8692,"I have a few pfleuger reels, and like solo, I'm sold on them. I'm a diawa reel guy from way back, but the pfluegers are well worth the price, and just as good as any shimano or diawa I've owned.  Even the president series are great. I have 3 of them, and tend to use them a lot more than any others, and my kids use them as well. To say they take a beating is an understatment.  Super smooth, light, and the drags are awesome.  S."
668046,Grimace,2012-02-20 00:58:00,2020,I fish the Niagara for steel with the Supreme and the drag is beautiful.
668055,NANUK,2012-02-20 01:31:00,797,"Pflueger sounds like a winner with all the positive reviews. Just made some calls, SAIL has the Supreme XT on sale for $129.97 and the Patriach XT for about $165 They will have no tax sale on Wednesday Feb22 for their VIP members. (just register on line or fill out a little form at their store) Pretty good deal IMO"
668057,danbouck,2012-02-20 01:34:00,4380,I wouldn't trade my Pfluegers for anything!
668069,Gregoire,2012-02-20 02:01:00,1397," The only thing I will say about the patriarch it that it is pretty fragile and glued together in parts. My handle broke and a metal piece fell in the water, and getting replacement parts is not easy. That is why I am moving over to shimano. I have a stradic and a sustain and I have far more confidence in them lasting longer and being easier to fix than the pflueger. Having said that my partriarch is the smoothest reel I own. If you are going to baby your reel and constantly maintain it than a pflueger is great, but if you are like me and abuse your reels I think a shimano is better."
668102,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-20 03:11:00,2690,"Picked up a Supreme for ice fishing, love it.  Also love both my Pflueger Arbors. Have also bought two Pfluegers for Juli, and both have been smooth as silk.  Best reels for the money right now."
668113,kickingfrog,2012-02-20 03:26:00,8333,"I have numerus stratics, new and old, but no Saroses. I have one small supreme xt that I have only used for part of one year. For the price that you mentioned I think I would get the Pfluger. There will be more sales in the coming weeks if you're willing to chance it and save even more."
668157,Rod Caster,2012-02-20 12:14:00,5784,"Is this a good price?  http://ca.wholesales...prod247154.html   They also have the Abu Garcia Soron for $100 (50 off). I have this one and love it. After all these positive Supreme reviews though, I'm having a hard time not clicking on ""add to cart""."
668181,kickingfrog,2012-02-20 14:04:00,8333, The reel pictured is not a Supreme XT. The price shown is so much below what the xt retails for I think the price matches the picture not the name.
668219,doubleheader,2012-02-20 17:00:00,497,"I was in the market for a good reel for jigging eyes. I was at a Cabelas store two weeks ago. I have always owned Shimano,mostly Symetres and one Stradic but I picked up the Stradic FJ and the red one I think it's a C4? Anyhwow neither was smooth, I could hear a slight dragging sound while operating both. I picked up a Stella, no dragging sound but for that money I can take a trip. Then I picked up a Supreme, the black one, no dragging sound, and super smooth. I decided to buy the 30 size, and sense I bought the last one they had in the store they gave me a discount for buying the demo. Can't wait to give it a go as the real test will be how it performs over time. Glad to read you guys like them."
668233,GBW,2012-02-20 18:34:00,8460,"doubleheader, the FJ made noise?  I have a brand new FJ (2500 size) and it's like butta, smoooooth and doesn't make a sound.  Jigger I think wanted to hide it from me and keep it when I wasn't looking...  HAHA"
668240,doubleheader,2012-02-20 19:19:00,497," It did for sure, as did most all the reels I handled, but keep in mind these were store models so who knows how much abuse they may have seen."
668251,GBW,2012-02-20 20:20:00,8460,very odd.  mine is so smooth it's crazy.  I almost got a few more because it's that good.  the Ci4 is close to the stradic FJ but I hate the grip.  I had one and sold it with in a day cause I didn't like the EV grip.
668373,danbouck,2012-02-21 01:06:00,4380, It is a Supreme XT. They changed the look in 2011. That model is an awesome reel!
668378,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 01:14:00,5784," Thanks for clarifying Dan. I've never used a Supreme XT, so I couldn't properly identify it just from the photo. That's one heck of a deal then. Maybe my Abu days are over."
668379,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 01:16:00,8333, So that's the previous generation shown in the photo?
668382,danbouck,2012-02-21 01:23:00,4380, Yes
