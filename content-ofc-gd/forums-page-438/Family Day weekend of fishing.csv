I sure needed the break and head out fishing with good friends. We started off with a few tugs on the line in which didnt produce a thing, so I decided to switch up and match the hatch. On my second cast, WHAM shes on  . Chris then decided to do the same and WHAM another one hit  . Mine was 8lbs 1oz, Chrises was aprox 5 and change. After a little while we had switched spots, only for I to have two quick hits and frank had one on for a few seconds Cest la vie, the fish didnt want to play anymore. , It was great to finally get out again and have that feeling flow through my veins. Thanks guys, I really needed it  Out of respect for a few members, I have blocked the background, sorry guys  "

Always fun fishing with friends, especially when you make a new one.  Good to meet you after a bunch of pm's, Chris. As for the fishing, the home team beat out us visitors Definitely looking forward to some early season trolling.  I know Rick is climbing the walls waiting to get the boat out"
