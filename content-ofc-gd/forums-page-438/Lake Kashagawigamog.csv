Any input as to best ways to target the wally's, current ice conditions,  the lodge itself, or any other things good or bad would be appreciated. Can be mobile on foot if need be, just trying to decide if it's worth taking the auger ect, or if there is a need to move around alot. Lastly, I believe it is in Zone 17, would that be correct? Dan"

Haven't got my reg book here to verify but I think it's north of zone 17 (zone 15?).  Check the regs before you go either in the free book you can get at license issuers or on the MNR website and be sure.  Michael"

That's pretty much a given for anywhere though IMO.   Unfortunately we never got into many walleye.  We caught a bunch of small perch, some herring and OOS musky.   Best fishing for us was the area before the narrows to Grass Lake.  However, the few walleye caught were near his huts that were further down the bay.   Not sure what the ice is like this year though, so be cautious in those narrows if you go that way.  We stayed in the main lodge (?) I think.   Wasn't the cleanest place, but was fine for us.   Wouldn't take my family there though.  The owner seemed pleasant enough.  If the fishing was better, we'd probably go back."
