496945,justwannafish,2010-08-22 04:32:00,82,So here's a bit of a better pic of the yak while I was launching at Martindale Pond earlier today. Sadly it was a completely unsuccessful outing but I can pretty much guarantee that I will have a sweet report after next weekend. I'm goin camping to a remote access only lake with a buddy of mine from New Zealand. Gotta show the Kiwi how Ontario lake fishing can be!  That orange chair in the back of the boat is clearly something I added. I just thought I'd put it in there to show how big and awesome this thing is. Fully capable of seating two for a day on the lake.  
496946,justwannafish,2010-08-22 04:33:00,82,The last pic was a lot smaller than I had intended This should be better........  
496990,jediangler,2010-08-22 12:49:00,1923,"Hey justwannafish, check out Yakfisher.net. It's an Ontario (and some Quebec) kayak angler's site with many experienced and novice yakfishers. There are even a few Hobie PA owners on there that could help you with rigging ideas. I'm sure there are yakfisher members in your area. They even have a tournament series if you like the competitive thing. You can never trust what the manufacturers list as the weight of their yaks, I heard the PA comes in at 118lbs with seat and minimal rigging. Enjoy your new toy."
497052,justwannafish,2010-08-22 15:19:00,82,"Thanks! Will do!  Seems there's endless possibilities with rigging that thing up with equipment and what-not. I've just got my portable fish finder, Bass Pro XPS tackle bag, and chair tied down with nylon rope. It'll be cool to see how other people rigged theirs up."
668345,Henricus,2012-02-20 23:50:00,118,"Okay, I am reviving this thread since I just came back from the fishing show and spent quite a while ogling this thing.  After test driving the mirage drive system on vacation last week I am sold on its benefits.  My biggest question is can you get that thing on top of your car by yourself?"
668374,justwannafish,2012-02-21 01:08:00,82,"Yup No problem I had a chevy cobalt when I bought that amazing angling weapon Being able to independently maneuver this beast was one of my favourite things. What I did (because I had bought the cart when I bought the yak) was roll it right up to the back of my car first. To avoid scratching my trunk I rolled out a mat over the trunk. I would then lift the bow of the hobie on top of the trunk. Then I moved around to the back of the yak and then pushed it up to the roof racks The whole thing is really not that heavy especially when you're sliding it along a plane Of you're even considering buying this bad boy then you should absolutely go for it I seriously have nothing at ALL bad to say about it aside from the hefty tag But really, what is the price of utter elation!?? Go for it man If you're at all like my you won't regret it  Let me know how it goes!!!!"
668375,TDunn,2012-02-21 01:08:00,680,"Below is one option.   I'm running a Pro Angler for the 2012 season. I can't wait!  If you have anymore questions about your Hobie, PM me.   TDunn"
668397,justwannafish,2012-02-21 01:42:00,82,"That's a great system if you're down to spend the extra cash for the specific roof rack system and additional bar. My pockets were scraped clean after buying my dream toy though. Also, I had never taken my seat off once when I drove with it on my racks and I literally made hundreds of trips. I'm sure the drag may hurt the mpg a bit more but there were no issues ever with it flying off the yak or even loosening. That bar does absolutely make it a quicker, easier load but if you're like me and don't want to spend much more cash, it's not necessary. Regardless off how you get the PA to where you're going, the hardest part is 100% going to be getting off the water to go home. Trust me on that!! Hahahaha Have fun!!"
668436,Henricus,2012-02-21 02:57:00,118,"Thanks guys.  I need another toy like I need a hole in the head but this thing looks like a blast.  Justwannafish, did you ever have any luck in Hamilton harbour?  Has anybody ever tried it downtown Toronto or Around the Island?"
668457,Snidley,2012-02-21 05:10:00,620,"I use a Hobie kickboat but the launches are the same. Be carefull in Toronto Harbour/Toronto Island as the cops will want to see a harbour permit. There's tons of launches around the GTA, virtually every waterfront or stream essentially, but also impounds like Montsberg, Island Lake, Shades Mills, Valens and some others around Hamilton are the ticket. I've had my Hobie for about a dozen years and I still consider it the single best thing I have ever purchased, period. Nothing beats hooking up with a 30lb Chinnook, in the middle of the night, on a bass casting  rod. They hit so hard its like a haymaker to the noggin.Thank goodness there's no more standing on piers with loogans or battling the crowds onstream for me thanks to my Hobie."
668599,yakpiker,2012-02-21 21:24:00,160, I've fished the Toronto harbour and islands dozens of times during the past 3 years in my Hobie Revolution and have never been stopped or asked for a permit by the marine unit.  Why would that be required for a kayak?
495268,justwannafish,2010-08-17 02:22:00,82,"So I just bought the kayak of my dreams last week and took it to Fish Lake just north of Bracebridge from some quiet bass fishing. Oh man!! I was out for ten hours on the first session!!! I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this thing is. If you haven't heard of it, you need to look it up. HobieCat.com and then look up the Fishing kayaks. Unbelieveable!!    Anyway, now that I can finally get ON the water I'm wonderin if anyone has some insight as to where to launch. I'm thinkin of goin to the Grand this weekend. Or maybe the Credit or Bronte. I haven't really done any serious fishing in any of those places so if you've got some tips on those or any others I'd love to hear them!  And again, PLEASE, go check out the Pro Angler if you're one for getting out by yourself and away from it all! Definitely my new favourite toy!  Look forward to hearin back!  Later!!"
495270,alexcba,2010-08-17 02:30:00,634,great lookin yak bro.
495275,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 02:57:00,0,Very nice and stealthy looking....I have a 2009 Ocean Kayak Trident 15 and absolutely love it. Don't be afraid to go on Lake Ontario with a downrigger on that thing. Kayaks....going places shore fishermen and big boats can only dream of.....PEACEOUT!
495278,SudburyAngler,2010-08-17 03:04:00,154,yup
495299,Cudz,2010-08-17 05:00:00,2652,Don't know much about kayaks but that one looks cool.  How much does it weigh?  It looks a bit chunkier and possibly more stable than most.
495310,fish_fishburn,2010-08-17 10:38:00,1311,Justwannafish that is a sweet yak. I have been humming about a fishing kayak for awhile now and I think I just found it. I checked out the site and there is a dealer 50 miles from me. The Hank Parker video is good too. What are they retailing for if you don't mind me asking. With so many lakes in Renfrew County and alot that are just to hard to get even a small tinny into this is the answer. Thanks for sharing that with us.
495315,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-17 10:56:00,0,Enjoy! Your going to have alot of fun in that Kayak! Looking forward to your reports!
495341,justwannafish,2010-08-17 12:36:00,82,"Fish fishburn,  Retail was $2695 on sale for $2395 Then I bought roof racks and locks and the cart for the kayak (all for which I received 15% off at Swift Canoe and Kayak in Gravenhurst). So after all was said and done it was about $3300. Best money I have ever spent! Every weekend is like a small vacation now. Love it!!!!  Cudz, it weighs about 140-190lbs depending on what you have it loaded with and yes it's wider and exceptionally stable. When I'm not trolling with it (another amazing capability) I'm casting standing up without even thinking twice!  And, again, if anyone has some advice on where to launch around here (Hamilton area) it wouldne great to hear about it! Thanks guys!  P.s. There is still one left where I got mine! If you get the chance, go check it out!"
495362,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-17 13:52:00,0,"  (spits out drink) Thats almost 3x heavier than mine, but if you standing in it then it's an excellent kayak.  "
495366,Mike Pike,2010-08-17 14:12:00,1332,That looks like a very versatile craft.  No wonder you're enjoying it so much!  Curious if you hit Hammy Harbour with it yet.  I've always exploring the harbour for bass would be pretty adventageous in a craft like yours.
495374,justwannafish,2010-08-17 14:29:00,82,"Mike Pike,  Thanks! I'll check it out for sure this weekend. Maybe I'll see ya out there!"
495404,Mike Pike,2010-08-17 15:25:00,1332,Good luck!  If I'm out there I'll be crawling the shoreline so if I see ya I'll be sure to holler.  Do you have enough room for two on your yak???  lol
495417,NAW,2010-08-17 15:49:00,4022,"That's the one with the leg powered drive system in it right??  How does that work.  Is it tough on the legs?  What happens when you get into weeds with it, does it jam up?"
495439,justwannafish,2010-08-17 16:21:00,82,"Sounds good Pike! One seated though sorry! Hahah  F is H,  Yeah it's their patented mirage drive system. And you can move at a pretty astonishing clip if you're goin full out. But just for trolling it doesn't even feel like you're pushing! Very efficient system. And because nothing rotates but instead is moved back and forth there is no jamming or tangling at all. Check out their website for videos of it working and more info Pretty amazing! It's very very well designed"
495621,fish_fishburn,2010-08-18 00:20:00,1311,Rapalaboy the dry weight is 88lbs and fully loaded is 138. It will carry 600 lbs max.
495657,justwannafish,2010-08-18 01:57:00,82," Do you fish the whole harbour? I'm not sure where to start. Or where the fish are really. Do you go west of Dundurn and Princess Point area in the at little bay like thing? Or do you mostly stay east of that in the Bayfront park sort of area? Also, what are you using mostly? I've been gettin some good success on soft plastics and spinners up north but not sure what to cast here. Any suggestions?  Thanks again! Hope to see you out this weekend!"
495660,justwannafish,2010-08-18 01:59:00,82, Yeah definitely had my numbers wrong there! Hahah What's fifty pounds anyway! Whoops!!  I'll post some pics when I get back from the Harbour this weekend. Hopefully they'll have fish in them!
495664,justwannafish,2010-08-18 02:05:00,82,This is the view from the driver's seat. It's all you could ever ask for and then some. I'll put some more detailed ones up once I get it out again. Needless to say I was just a little too preoccupied when I had it out the first time!! Stay tuned! 
495722,2kj,2010-08-18 04:06:00,77,"Im jealous, I am ready to buy a fishing kayak but my budget is around 1200 mark.  That thing is a machine.  I fish the Grand often, PM me with anything you need to know.  As soon as I get mine I will send you a message as I wouldnt mind having a partner for the Grand or anywhere else to do some yak fishing! Cheers"
495770,Mike Pike,2010-08-18 13:13:00,1332,"I primarly fish that long bay where the boat launch is.  As summer draws on the weeds get up and it difficult to really work from shore.  Plastics rigged weedless is what I use alot.  I always thought those islands along the walking path by the railway tracks would be a good area to work, too.  Maybe some of the guys who fish the harbour in their boats could chime in here, cuz I'm not very familiar with the rest of the harbour area."
495778,tb4me,2010-08-18 13:40:00,3295,nice yak! I seen those at the fising and boating show. Can still hear the wife now..(nevermind   )
495967,bigreddog,2010-08-19 00:05:00,84,Awesome!  Would love to get one myself.
495988,Fishstick,2010-08-19 01:21:00,8,"Great boats! Very versatile, i've had mine since this spring and have done a ton of fishing in it so far. Here's a pic from this past weekend...  "
496231,fishnsled,2010-08-19 20:52:00,3520,Nice looking ride.  Just watched the 2 videos off the website and it's very impressive.  I can think of a ton of lakes I'd like to fish with one of those.   Looking forward to your reports.
496358,fish_fishburn,2010-08-20 10:21:00,1311,Nice Striper fishstick. My buddy in New Brunswick keeps telling me to get down there for some Striper fishing. Says they fight like no tomorrow. Hopefully next year.
