668050,bucktail,2012-02-20 01:09:00,1857,"Only got the last 30 minutes in. Sure wish I had been there when they discussed Quinte muskie. Grew up there my whole life and only saw a handfull of skies.  The waters were murkier back then and not as condusive. Show was good and the silent auction very good but i ddint get any I bid for. Really wanted the big Beckman net.    The rest of the show was ok , got to compare Lund models side by side which is nice. Got a steel dipsey set up, not a deal but the guy was full of info that made it worth it. No deals on any high end equipement other then some no tax on St Croixs.    Darren"
668074,Gregoire,2012-02-20 02:11:00,1397,"I was at the whole seminat and don't remember any talk of quinte musky. I am sure they are there, but probably not in any large number."

668201,Pigeontroller,2012-02-20 15:46:00,2793,"Our 'Muskie Sunday' events in conjunction with the 2012 Spring Fishing & Boat Show were a tremendous success. Nearly $8000 was raised which will benefit the Muskellunge fishery in Canada through various conservation and research projects. This would not have been possible were it not for the generous support of Andy and Vita Pallotta, the organizers of the Spring Fishing & Boat Show. We had a great turnout of over 250 people that showed up to hear Jim Saric, Gord Pyzer and 'Big' Jim McLaughlin in an informal question and answer type seminar. These three top Muskie Anglers, with some help from the audience informed and entertained us for almost two hours!  The success of 'Muskie Sunday' was also possible due to the generous support of many other people who donated product to an amazing silent auction. Muskies Canada would like to thank, Andrea Childs - Scotsman Point Resort. Steve Niedzwiecki - Chaudiere Lodge. Cara Lee & Garnet Hughes - South Shore Camping and Ice Condos, Wayne & Karen Haagsma - Pigeon Lake Resort, Ian Young, Greg Videki, Keith Davison, Jim Saric - Musky Hunter TV Show & Magazine, Shawn Maher - Hosebaits, Mike Parker - Handlebarz Lures, Dave Michaluk - Bare Bones Baits, Bob Stirling â€“ St. Croix Rods, Phil Harrison - etackle.ca, Marc Arena - Red October Baits, Holiday Inn Waterfront Hotel Peterborough, Jonathan Taylor - Frantic Baits, Brian & Steve Lo - JB's Fishing Depot, Carl Linker - CL Fishing, Dave Dutchak - Trojan Tackle, The Niagara Musky Association, Yvon Grise, Joe Spagnoli, Pure Fishing Canada, 'Big' Jim McLaughlin/ Shimano Canada, Charles Weiss, Tony Gallucci - Beaver Lures, Jared Chartrand - Northstar Marine Insurance (who provided the refreshments).  Thanks to fellow MCI members who gave freely of their time in the planning and running of this event. Ian Young, Vince Giuliani, Mike McCutcheon, Tom McCutcheon, Bruce Park, and Kevin Linder. Thanks to Richard Bennett, Chris Chilcott, Steve Stewart, and Harry Valters for working hard Sunday morning to help make it happen! These kinds of fund raising events define what Muskies Canada is all about. It would not happen without the efforts of dedicated members who both ran the event, and showed up to support it!"
