667579,brkygetr,2012-02-17 22:05:00,425,Anyone have an idea. Mine is shot.
667581,FishAbout,2012-02-17 22:10:00,106,The Source sells them.  Bought one the other day.  http://www.thesource.ca/estore/product.aspx?language=en-CA&catalog=Online&category=Specialty+Batteries&product=2318250
667590,Fisherman,2012-02-17 22:34:00,7201,Most any place that sells automotive batteries either has them in stock and can get them overnight.
667592,Fisherman,2012-02-17 22:36:00,7201," Holy grapola, that's worse than being held up, that's outright thievery, $59 + tax.  I'm bettin McGuinty runs that store.  You can get them for less than $30."
667594,wallyboss,2012-02-17 22:40:00,1095,I buy them at Total Battery in Ottawa. There must be a Battery store where you are.  I would not pay more than $25.00 for one.
667599,Jet,2012-02-17 22:50:00,364,Check Dan's ad in the classified. Just got mine and it works great!
667606,Sinker,2012-02-17 23:27:00,8692,You can get them at any electrical supply shop. Usually around 20-30 bucks.  S.
