46793,OhioFisherman,2007-03-14 03:26:00,6623,I like my dear raw!
46798,JerseyDog,2007-03-14 03:33:00,190,Went with Daplumma's recipe except I swapped pepper for oxcowboy's idea of Montreal steak spice and no mushrooms (since I had none on hand). Pan fried in a cast iron pan to a perfect medium rare and served with a side of caesar salad.  What an awesome treat! My wife is new to venison and she was pretty wary but a couple of bites and she was definately sold.  And I have 10 more packets of chops in the freezer so I will be trying every the variation above. Thanks all for the quick reponses!
