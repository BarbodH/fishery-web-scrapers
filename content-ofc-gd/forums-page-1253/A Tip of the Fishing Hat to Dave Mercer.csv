Also a tip of the hat to all that contributed. I'm sure Dave's Mom is looking down on him today with a proud smile. Great job Dave and to all those involved."

46473,Dave Mercer,2007-03-13 16:55:00,148,"WOW, All I can say is thanks for the kind words. But most of the credit should be given to the many fine folks who took part or supported CFC in 06. Our 07 campain is kicking off this weekend with The Casting for a Cure BBQ at Bass Pro Shops. So if you are by the store on Saturday or Sunday. Make sure to buy a hot dog out front all the money goes right to Casting for a Cure. Once again thanks to everyone for all your support. Hope to see you all this weekend. Make sure you say hi.  Regards, Dave Mercer www.factsoffishing.com"
