46575,Doctrt,2007-03-13 21:02:00,141,Looking to get my brother out on the weekend.  I was thinking about fishing lake Joseph.  Does any one have any information on ice conditions for the area.  I'm just hoping it will hold up during the warm spell this week.  Thanks in advance. Tim

All current areas wide open. If you know there's lots of ice where you normally fish...shouldn't be an issue with some good high waterproof boots."
