46757,bucktail,2007-03-14 02:31:00,1857,Spool up your new spinning gear and save your money up. Here is a lake that has NEVER seen a lure!!! Imagine being the first person tocast for fish here!!! http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-026
46766,GbayGiant,2007-03-14 02:45:00,1780,"That's wild, it makes you wonder what else is up there.  I get the first cast."
46771,vance,2007-03-14 02:59:00,719,I would think that your Ice auger better have a REALLY long shaft   vance
46778,danc,2007-03-14 03:05:00,4677,You don't have to go to Saturn for that. There's tons of lakes in Northern Ontario that have the same status.
46780,solopaddler,2007-03-14 03:09:00,8605, Actually was just about to say the same thing. I've fished many tiny lakes in the far north that have very likely never seen another angler before or since
46801,Castmaster,2007-03-14 03:41:00,86,DUH! Little green men! Hello!
46846,Greencoachdog,2007-03-14 10:16:00,8163,"I'm sorry, but fishing in a sea of liquid methane isn't my idea of a fun fishing trip."
46892,Headhunter,2007-03-14 12:58:00,5703,"Fishin in Methane would be fun, until the first guy goes to light a smoke! HH"
46927,bigfish1965,2007-03-14 14:11:00,3382,Doesn't methane only exist on earth from decay of living matter?
46952,just2manylures,2007-03-14 14:56:00,144,Thats an OFNCers dream if I ever seen one. The fish would probably hit anything
46957,douG,2007-03-14 15:19:00,2693,"Methane is found all over the place, Rick, not just here at home."
46977,kissmybass,2007-03-14 15:56:00,36,imagine the size of the northern's up there!!
