46013,Mattitude,2007-03-12 14:49:00,155,"That's crazy!!  I've done about 115 mph in my car and that was fast,  but at that speed (250mph)could you imagine if you had to sneeze!  Apparently the stereo in that car costs $40,000 alone."
46014,Markystang,2007-03-12 14:50:00,131,Wow. That's pretty quick.
46017,bigfish1965,2007-03-12 14:58:00,3382,Can you get that with a towing package?
46018,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-12 15:00:00,1351,wow.. speechless...wow

46023,Tybo,2007-03-12 15:08:00,1373,MY truck would still spank it 0-60.
46027,young_one,2007-03-12 15:17:00,620,"darn it... no governor on that car. =P Europeans are really lucky. No no, I mean dangerous."
46063,Bernie,2007-03-12 16:59:00,3190,Incredible!!!! Drove a Mercedes 360 160 mph once. But 250? wow.
46070,OhioFisherman,2007-03-12 17:13:00,6623,"Drove a couple of quick vettes, a 427 65 chevelle, that is way to fast for most humans! If you can spend 40 grand for a car stereo they should take your money away! LOL buy a boat!"
46071,bigfish1965,2007-03-12 17:14:00,3382,"It is sad that even if I dropped my mini-van out of a jet, it would still only reach the terminal velocity of 126 MPH"
46075,SlowPoke,2007-03-12 17:27:00,2984,"""... at 400 km/h the tires will only last about 15 minutes but that's okay, the gas will only last about 12 minutes"" Nice."
46079,OhioFisherman,2007-03-12 17:33:00,6623,If you gotta ask the price you can`t afford gas for it?
46080,ecmilley,2007-03-12 17:34:00,2163,If I could get Z-rated trailer tires....

46737,Carp,2007-03-14 01:41:00,1488,Fastest I've gone was in a small sports car I had years ago. Speedometer hit about 220km/h and I let up on the accelerator. That was enough for me.  This guy was doing 407km/h. HOLY CRAP !!! I would have soiled myself at that speed.  That car should be in the next James Bond movie.  Great video Gary. Thanks
