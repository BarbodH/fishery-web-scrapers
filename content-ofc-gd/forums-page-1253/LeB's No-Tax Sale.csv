46325,silveradosheriff,2007-03-13 11:55:00,1025,
46329,just2manylures,2007-03-13 12:02:00,144,I think BPSBASSMAN might be a little bias...but heck if they will be handing out deals like that I will be going there too!!!!!
46330,bpsbassman,2007-03-13 12:04:00,941,"Call it spam if you want. I'm not saying don't shop at LeBarons (or anywhere else).  I just want to make people aware that if its more convenient, you can save some gas and get the same deal.  I'm not sure that people are aware that BPS will match the no tax deal. Sorry if you're offended by that."
46343,silveradosheriff,2007-03-13 12:33:00,1025,BPSBASSMAN - It's all good!  
46350,aniceguy,2007-03-13 12:49:00,1094,"BPS matching the same price as Lebaron or vice versa, would be fantastic if either store actually had what I wanted.  I have been trying to humminbird 757c for over a week now and cant seem to find anyone with it"
46363,Golfisher,2007-03-13 13:20:00,586,I didn't know that BPS did price matching.  Thanks for the info.
46380,mdej,2007-03-13 14:10:00,98," Thanks Roger, I did not know BPS did price match.  Unfortunately LeBaron is very close to me compared to BPS.  But I did make my annual BPS donation this week already."
