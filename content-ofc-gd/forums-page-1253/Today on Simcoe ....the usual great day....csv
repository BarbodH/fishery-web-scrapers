46128,icefisherman,2007-03-12 20:15:00,952,"Boy is it nice when someone takes you on the snow machine so I don't have to walk km's  and waste valuable fishing time...Compliments to RR for the ride and to him and Rick for the great company today...  Did we start early today of what...and I mean EARLY ha ha....like 6am early on the ice ;-) 6:30 on the spot...short wait to see where exactly we are...then about an hour of test drilling in the area until we found them....after that...oh well you know the story by now ;-) While I kept hooking and loosing them, including releasing the small ones....Rick and Don got each quick limit...since I hate catching them very quickly and having to go home after that I took longer ;-)...one whitie even swam away with my Meegs lure...  I'd like to have one last kick at the can tomorrow...and am looking to go with someone with a machine to save me the long walk...in exchange I feel we can find the right spot and get one more quick limit.... Hope by next ice season I have my own machine and don't have to ask any more...Yes Don...I have the one you told me about under very serious consideration...Rick was going to take me but his sled had a small technical problem today and I am not sure if he can give a ride tomorrow....So if someone wants to go please PM me...  Anyhow....back to the fishing today... We give the lakers fair try but no luck there... Maybe tomorrow...who knows...not easy to get double limit ;-)  Again thanks for the nice time Rick and Don.  Here are few pictures courtesy of Don's camera...they do look better then my cell phone pictures;-) I am sure Don can add some of his own...        Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

46260,ccmtcanada,2007-03-13 02:31:00,7971,Very nice report!  I went ice fishing a grand total of 2 times and was skunked!  Good to see others having success.
46326,Smokey,2007-03-13 11:55:00,1278,"Nice fish, Congrats. I guess with the warm weather coming there won't be much easy travel left on the lake."
46457,ehg,2007-03-13 16:27:00,2666,"One of the most successful Simcoe ice reports this year.  Nice going,  ehg"
46477,irishfield,2007-03-13 17:06:00,26272,Great stuff Emil!  If you're going out Wednesday...take a Jon boat with a Merc Jet drive outboard on it ! LOL
46498,SlowPoke,2007-03-13 18:05:00,2984,"Nice going Emil, We needed you on Saturday... although we didn't have enough time on the ice, we struck out. Maybe next year we should hook-up. We'll get you out there and you find them. And if you don't find them.... hehehe"
46540,icefisherman,2007-03-13 19:53:00,952,"  Hey Brian,  Congratulation first on your new boat Bud. Looks great. Not to worry about the ice fishing thing...boat fishing is coming shortly ha ha...stopped at the Bass Pro today, got some small staff...trying to get ready. Knowing you are good and resourcefull with the trolling equipment let me know if you see good used manual downrigger and rod/reel combo. I need a second set of the the above. You know the price range I am looking to spend. And yes next year we'll do a proper ice trip with you. Hope I get a snowmobile by then ;-)  Wayne,  Nope...this is it for my ice fishing season...may try one perching day in the next week or two as ice allows since this is my first ice season without any perch trip so fat. But other then that I am done with the ice. Now let's talk about those boats ;-)  Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
