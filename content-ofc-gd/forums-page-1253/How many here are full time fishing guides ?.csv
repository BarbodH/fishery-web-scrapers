46431,trapshooter,2007-03-13 15:23:00,1234,"This has been an interesting read for me too.  Currently my only job is guiding for a lodge in NW Ont, however, I have been thinking of eventually making the jump to the type of guide service you are talking about.  I have learned a lot about customer service from my boss at the lodge and also gained valuable experience spending over 200 days in my boat with guests over the last 2 seasons.  I know it would be a lot of work and the start up would be costly.... but it's a lifestyle.  If you are passionate, go for it.  I worked for 3 years in a 'career' type job, sitting in front of a computer and I hated it so I made the jump to something I truly enjoy.  One thing I know is I will never go back to a M-F office type job.  Best of luck to you John.  Cheers, ben."

46886,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-14 12:29:00,621,"Hi John, been reading this thread, some good replies by all, I’ll share my experience in this way of life  Can you make a good living? John, you can earn a living but most that I know don't do it for this reason It’s a way of Life We choose this way of life for peace and tranquility If you’re getting into it for financial rewards, your getting into it for the wrong reasons Generally folks work some 300 days a year, to be financially stable you are going to work some 200 days in a row. I start May 12 or opener of walleyes and go till mid to end of  November with clients then pick and choose my days through ice up unless I have promo shoots to do late in the season for fishing related companies. There are no days off unless cancellations occur  The hardest part is building a family, most if not all will agree with me that the amount of time spent away from ones family working is very strenuous. This has been very difficult for me and my kids but they understand and enjoy the time we spend together whether fishing or other activities. Guiding Full Time as a means of income means you have a set number of days to earn enough to keep you going during off seasons. There are some guides I know which will vary species from season to season and continue on during the winter; generally they have fewer days in the off season than the soft water season. As Outdoorguy61 posted the best operations for near yearly operations are on the west coast. Although there are several guides that operate what I consider full time, even though it’s seasonal to soft water. Some are more visible than others nonetheless there are a few full guides that do exist that rely solely on this type of income from this way of life. Most guides that operate do so as a means of extra income and have a full time income elsewhere. Myself the soft water season I guide, the off season I do video editing and time coding and network and coordinated business agreements and book destinations for following year filming for TV show called Outdoor Passion/Passion Plein air I also network with many other professionals and lodges and outfitters I guess in a way I earn my living 2 ways, fishing and the fishing business  For myself, it all started when I was younger 12-13 years olds, my dad worked for a TV station affiliate of ctv which aired Izumi's first series of shows. I told my dad, I want to do that later, his reply was work hard enough and you can do become what you want. My dad being a hard working man taught just that (even though I complained about it through my younger years) He gave me the tools to accomplish and overcome any of life obstacles in his teachings of hard work I wrote to everyone, Bob and In fisherman sent articles to me to read, these articles contained pieces on how to earn a living in the fishing business Guiding, Tourneys and Professional fishing promoter. What every article seemed to key in on is find a “Niche"" that you can fill and this will allow for longevity of your career choice or means of earning a living at fishing .For a long time I rolled around to discover a niche, time wasted. How does one discover a niche is pretty simple in nature, you do and fish what naturally attracts you, and then your niche will develop into a reputable part of what sets you apart from others. Too many get into it trying to do what others are doing. Best you go about it developing your personal niche, because it will bring out the best in you and set you apart. I started doing some local guiding when I was 19, now 39.From 19 to 21 I did a season for an outfitter which was not what I liked so I continued to venture on my own. I'd say till I was around 23 -24, I was not to serious at it and did what ever came my way in species specific but always had my obsession for muskies and fished em since the age of 16. Around 24 things started coming around in my niche, muskies were getting more familiar to my knowledge and consistency in captures and large specimens soon developed sent in pics to magazines and not long after my phone started to ring with interest of what I was doing. In ways I have been very fortunate to have been surrounded by many great profiled anglers we know today during my years of learning at this way of life and I continue to learn as years go by. Throughout this lifestyle I have formed another niche in other areas of the business apart from guiding, it’s the networking business side of things, which I enjoy also. What allowed me to financially sustain myself until the time was right was I owned another business which I have sold some 4 years ago now. It provided well but was not where I found peace and tranquility but it allowed enough time for me to build the way of life I currently enjoy. From that business I learned the networking side of doing business in which I currently use in the fishing end of things now. So all in all from the day I wished to be in this way of life until today, every experience and lesson I learned has been useful in allowing me to accomplish my goals,  In most work fields or careers Most folks can’t wait to go to bed after a good days work  In this way of life you can’t wait to get up  As far as legally doing it, its pretty simple business You can Incorporate, which is really not all that needed unless you have a larger operation running multiple boats Very costly but also allows personal protection when under large operation  You can register which is economical and simple in nature  You can work as an autonomous worker which is equivalent somewhat to being registered  As far as insurance you need to be insured for your equipment and liability Generally 1 million to 2 million should suffice As far liability, Unless you are careless and place you guest in situations that could jeopardize their security not much responsibility should lie upon you .Its an outdoor activity which comes with its naturals perils of injury such as getting hooks in your hands ,cuts and scrapes. You may also waver off responsibilities but I suspect the safety responsibilities of your actions are always liable Getting started, I suggest you put together a good business plan Get a good marketing strategy which progressively becomes aggressive in relation to your income .Business networking also allows and offers good marketing strategies  Be yourself, we all go through the Ego phase, then we mature and realize it’s a means of earning a living equal to all other means. As you become more publicly known somewhat of a political correctness or politeness should exist (Wish I learned that one but I am just me) be involved in positive and constructive conservation efforts. Be truthful to yourself and others this allows for prolonged credibility and respect amongst all  Providing the service should come naturally as your knowledge and experience flourish Entertaining and providing good fun and laughs are what are essential simply because you spending 10 to 16 hours confined in tight quarters with people so humor is the remedy to dry spells and confinement  Help others as you progress in your way of life and possibly theirs also   Most of all be yourself and genuine It should come naturrally  I have always said in this business There are some that wish to be Some that want to be Some that are naturally born to be  To maximize on your niche You and the fish must become one  Ps,take note on Outdoorguy61 reply,valuable info shared by him Oudoorguy very good reply and experience shared Thanks  Marc"
