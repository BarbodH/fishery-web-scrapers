46861,turtle,2007-03-14 11:29:00,274,Yesterday 53 FOW off Thorah Island.  One whitefish 4 lbs or so between the two of us.  Suspended fish caught on a williams half and half.  Maybe a couple misses at the end of the day on a set line.  Other huts had 0-3 whitefish.  Overall slow but nice to be out in good weather.  Plus 11 when I got to the car. Very sloppy out there with water and slush.  Tough going if not in a tracked vehicle.  Hopefully some cold weather coming to give us a week or so of perch.
