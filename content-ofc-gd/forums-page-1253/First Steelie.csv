So on the way back we headed out to one of the eastern tributaries to try and find some open water.  Most of the river was still frozen but we found one small stretch and landed this 30.5"" steelie....weighing in at 11.5 lbs. on a green roe bag.  I hate to kill fish, but I am out of roe so this big hen had mature eggs that should last for the rest of the year.I sent to copy to our captain.  Jason   "
