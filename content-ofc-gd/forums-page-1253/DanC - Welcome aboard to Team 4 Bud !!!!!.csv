46792,danc,2007-03-14 03:26:00,4677," Well.... not just for me. Brook Trout are arguably Ontarios most prestigious game fish and should be included in the derby IMHO . I believe that the world record is the longest standing fresh water record on record (1914). But a Trout is a Trout in the derby. If I enter anything, it will be an incidental  40""+ Pike. They're fairly common up here."
46855,aplumma,2007-03-14 11:05:00,6896,good then take TJSA with you the next time and see if he can catch a 41 for team 8. You have my condolances for not making it past 4 and up to team 8... J/k good luck and catch some fish.  Art
