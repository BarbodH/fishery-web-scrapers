Almost all of the ice is out and we were good to go. About 5 minutes in a hit, fish on, set the hook...I guess I forgot to reset my drag after the winter, fish off.  We spent a couple hours down there and had a few follows on very typical slow presentation baits so i decided to go the oposite way and let a spinner sink and then burn it back.About 3 casts in my Mepps black fury was crushed by the fatest pike I have ever seen. Probably only 32 inches but 12-15lbs. 3 casts later I had a day ending birds nest with the new power pro.  All in all it was a great first day out and the pike are pretty active already."

46197,tbayboy,2007-03-12 23:31:00,1497,"Thats great stuff.  This year I'm definitely gonna head down and try the harbour pike action, I keep here great stories like yours."
46198,Rizzo,2007-03-12 23:37:00,4754,"good stuff.  Nice to see people getting out fishing before they close the season down there.  Sounds like that pike may have eaten a bowling ball, quite heavy for the length."
46199,BabyHerc,2007-03-12 23:38:00,285,"I'll be down there tomorrow.  If you don't hear from me, I didn't catch anything."
46202,mepps,2007-03-12 23:49:00,1301,Nice job! The only lure that has caught me more TO pike then the Black Fury is the Aglia.
