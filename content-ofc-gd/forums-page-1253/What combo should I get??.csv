46624,PatrickGG,2007-03-13 22:55:00,562,That combination of species would be hard to fit all on one rod and reel but if you are looking for a all around reel and rod the quantum incyte IT30F spinnig reel and a quantum catalyst 7'0 foot rod model CAS702MH would be a nice little outfit for all around fishing and will cost you around $140 all together.
