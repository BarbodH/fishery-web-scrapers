45757,Castmaster,2007-03-11 18:11:00,86,Fished for 2 hours! Didn't mark one fish but pulled wire in crystal clear water that was smooth like glass.  It was great to get out and scratch the itch.   Only came in becaues the ice told me too.

45795,FishFinder,2007-03-11 21:13:00,481,is it just me or is there a problem with photos on the site?

45818,GbayGiant,2007-03-11 22:32:00,1780,"The nails don't work for me either.  Before you post your pics, make sure it's the full picture on you computer when you copy the properties. Than it will come up full on your post, instead of the thumbs."
45822,fishindevil,2007-03-11 22:41:00,6254,"yes i got a warning about those pics as well..  ...it must have felt nice to get out in the boat...i cant wait im going crazy  ,i need to get my boat out real soon,it sure looked nice out on the river,and was prob fun dodging the icebergs....cheers"
45825,Gerritt,2007-03-11 22:46:00,6129,"Yup somethings is wrong with the thumbnails..... I too have been having issues with them.... either warnings, or they wont open at all....
