The only thing I caught was a sunburn on my face, but I can't remember the last sunburn I was this happy to receive.  Check out the satellite pic's of Lake St. Clair. Breaking up fast now. http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...ie.143.250m.jpg"

46779,Castmaster,2007-03-14 03:09:00,86,Water temp is 32 degrees and like 15 feet visibility. SUper clear. The fish are slow and spooky this time of year down here. Besides the fact that the ice flows kept me at bay from the early spring honey hole.
