My guy will be turning 40 this year and I'd like to host a special and surprise b.day party for him. He LOVEEEESSSS fishing - so I thought it would only make sense to theme the party around something he is so passionate about.  I'm looking for suggestions on the perfect place to host the party - a fishing/hunting lodge venue or a restaurant/bar etc. that feels like a fishing/hunting lodge.  Any suggestions are appreciated!  Areas of interest GTA, Mississauga, Brampton"

46666,Bernie,2007-03-14 00:15:00,3190,Hello Wifeofafisherman...I live too far away to be of much help. But I'm sure there are some folks on board who are willing to offer advise.      Ya right!  :lol:  :lol:    Younger than Forty...Ha haha hahahahahaha
46742,GbayGiant,2007-03-14 01:48:00,1780,"Here's an idea. Maybe higher a large charter fishing boat for the whole day that's big enough for a handful of friends or family, with drinks and food available of course (don't know if this is possible) and a little fishing while your at it . Lake Ontario has some big boat charters. I think he would like that, I know I would."
46821,outdoorguy61,2007-03-14 04:29:00,220,"Two ideas  1) Hire a charter boat. 2) Rent a fishing club with ponds (I seem to recall a club called the Halton Hills Club).  Sadly, I cannot think of one ""primo"" bar, restaurant anywhere in Canada (I travel a lot) with a solid fishing, hunting theme......even with just one lousy designated ""outdoor"" room. I got so fed up, I had my own made....humble and growing....complete with ponds.....and very tasteful.  The closest I have seen to being acceptable, is The Bing Retreat north of Kingston......expect to pay if you look them up. I have rented it for a night and a weekend and a few special events. It is beautiful, with rainbows, brookies, bass and some other species in a private lake.   outdoorguy61"
