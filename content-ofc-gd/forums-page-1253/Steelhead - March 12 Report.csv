46727,mattyk,2007-03-14 01:30:00,2110,sweet fish! Good work.
46733,Dano,2007-03-14 01:39:00,719,Nice looking fish! Congrats on your PB.
46060,ccmtcanada,2007-03-12 16:49:00,7971,"Well, I decided to take the day off work today to do some fishing!  I spent about a half hour last night tying roe bags in anticipation!!  With the temps above freezing, I couldn't resist the urge with the thought of fishing without a million layers of clothes and frozen fingertips.  So...I brushed up on everything CANADIAN COPPER has taught me in the two times we've fished together.  I headed out to my spot before sunrise...and had my line in the water by 7:15am...about a half hour before the sun rose.  Water had a greenish tinge and there was about 6 to 8"" of visibility.  It was a balmy +1C with a light west wind....this was heaven compared to the last few times out! (-18 and -25 with the windchill!!).  I started out using the roe bags at a bunch of different depths...and didn't even get a sniff for about 2 hours!  I then said to myself ""What would CC do???"".  He said that if roe isn't working, then change up your presentation...so that's what I did.  I put a little pink worm on and within about 10 minutes my float went under!!!  Adrenaline flowed through my body and I set the hook!!  The float and hook sailed out of the water and landed behind me....LOL.  About a half hour later, my float went down again!!  Missed it...dang!!!  I told myself I was leaving at 11am if I caught one or not.  At 10:45, my float went under.  I set the hook and there was tension!! WOO HOO!!!  I started fighting the fish and it jumped about a foot and a half out of the water....then....no tension.  DANG AGAIN!!  I began to reel in as fast as I could in case it was running towards me.  Sure enough, it came out of the water again!  This time I had a handle on it.  I called over a guy beside me to see if he'd net it and he obliged.  I'm glad he was there...I probably would have lost it.  Well...here's the pic...a new PB...25.5"" long and 5lbs 12oz.  Still on the small side, but it's only my third steelhead.  Chalk up an entry for team 6 in the OFC tourney!  I have another pic with a tape measure, but didn't post it here...sent that one to my team captain.  "
46062,Basskicker,2007-03-12 16:58:00,421,Nice fish....congratulations on a fine catch.  The next couple of weeks should be awesome in the creeks once the water settles down a bit.  Jason

46183,ccmtcanada,2007-03-12 22:48:00,7971," There is an easy answer to that....anyone who catches them but me!!! LOL.  Trust me...I'm still a newbie...I know a lot of the theory, but I dont have the experience that many others on this board have.  Thanks for the comment...but I'm no teacher!!!"
46215,Mike the Pike,2007-03-13 00:37:00,3421,"At about 7:30, the skunk that been on my back since early December finally came off!! After a nice fight, I landed this hen….my first ever steelie came in at 22.5”. (It’s a whole ½” bigger than ccmt’s, so I’m rubbing that in…lol). This one is a keeper so we can have some fresh roe and a nice little snack for later!   I bet your making Bly eat those words now LOL.  Congrats on your PB Cliff.Beauty of a fish."
