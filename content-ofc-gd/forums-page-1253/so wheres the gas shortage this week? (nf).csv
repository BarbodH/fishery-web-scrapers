46337,ecmilley,2007-03-13 12:25:00,2163,"gotta love the oil companys, still around a $1.02 guess the magic gas fairies will bring the price down after march break. almost think this would be classed as collusion, or criminal, cheating, or several other words that start with C , my rant for the day after droppintg $94 bones on fuel"
46347,OhioFisherman,2007-03-13 12:39:00,6623,"LOL gas prices are up like 25 cents a gallon here the last 2 weeks, they are predicting another 3+ dollar a gallon summer. Refining capacity is an issue, cleaner burning fuels for summer use, increased demand for the summer driving season, and no interest in increasing refining capacity because the increase in alternative fuels.  They do seem to have an answer for any situation!"
46413,just2manylures,2007-03-13 14:55:00,144,Once you start to tighten a screw it holds.  If you over tighten it cracks under pressure.  I can't wait until the pubic (who has been screwed) crackes on the oil companies.

46437,lickmyarmpit,2007-03-13 15:33:00,359,Just be happy you dont commute from london to brampton like I do.  Spend like 200 bucks a week on gas when its this expensive.  Wish there was a way to stick it to them but like beer its a necessity.
46453,lilkynan,2007-03-13 16:24:00,173,Guess the refinery is still on fire - or it must have been a real bad fire 4 weeks ago when it happened?? - Have seen no video of explosions yet - must be kept quiet from the media....  Suckers . . . . . .
46475,irishfield,2007-03-13 17:04:00,26272,$1.089 in Temagami...$1.05 in North Bay/Penetang/Midland
46503,Fishandchips,2007-03-13 18:19:00,72,"$3 a gallon would be nice, we are at 103.9 x 4.55 =$4.72 per Can gal the Gov't is going to build a new refinery so in 8-10 years the problem should be solved.Brian"
46550,mikemcmillan,2007-03-13 20:08:00,50,"Was in Newfoundland sledden last week and we payed 99 all week, Sunday went up to 1.06, 1.09 in KW right now. Do ya think were getten screwed."
46583,Northhunter,2007-03-13 21:42:00,214,"No no no... it's all because of ""supply and demand"", remember?  They're crooks. They'll use any excuse they can to jack the price and keep it up. We didn't have any new wars or conflicts, busted pipelines, tornadoes, hurricanes or wild sea monsters take out any rigs for a little while and prices were actually somewhat reasonable... but then here comes reading week/march break..."
46649,holdfast,2007-03-13 23:43:00,1813,"Prices here in North Battleford still stable at 93.  It Makes me sick to my stomach on the way they're ( Gas Companys, Pump Owners, and Spineless, Yellow bellied,  Blind Government) are taking advantage.  Yea its got to be because of March Break for this excuse.  Watch as March Break ends and gas goes down.  But it won't be much, as it gets higher for Victoria day.  Even higher Canada Day, but by then some other excuse will bring prices up.  Yea because Iran farted.  I really dont understand why prices are stable here, Then again the prices never changed when gas went down 4-5 dollars a barrel."
46652,motv8tr,2007-03-13 23:52:00,2587,No diesel here at one of the stations in Midland...thought that was over with...  Mauareen
