I ended up 2/2 with one Laker and one Whitefish and Shaun had some touches but no fish landed. It was a pretty slow day with most of the action coming early in the morning.  Both fish that were landed came off the spreaders on the bottom with minnows.  Here is a picture of our two man hut.    A nice Whitefish to end the Ice fishing season  Release Shot   Here is a picture of a guy taking his hut off for the season, lots of huts were coming off.   Won't be long now till I get the boat out for some spring fishing. Cheers AL www.alsadventures.ca"

46151,Rich Clemens,2007-03-12 21:15:00,3131,Yeah ... I'd say it's gettin' about the time to get the huts off.  Very nice laker there.
46257,spoonman,2007-03-13 02:29:00,103,Thanks but that fish is a whitefish not a laker. We did not get a picture of whitefish I had a memory chip problem. Cheers AL
