375802,[email protected],2009-08-24 13:19:00,290,"Good Morning!  Just uploaded some of the pics from my blackberry from my adventure fishing the grand on Saturday.  I got up at around 6am and made my trek out to Cockshut bridge. Finding the place I used to go as a child was a bit of a challenge, but I found it after much walking. You kind of have to go through the corn field and around the bend to the right of the bridge. There's a nice little hole where the water backwashes. Fish were jumping all day. It was crazy!.  Here is the crayfish that I caught, take a look at that HUGE one. It was more of a lobster  Big sucker  Kiss Kiss!  First smallie of the day, caught on a crayfish  Smallie caught later in the day back at Wilkes  Rock Bass took my lure!    I got stuck in the torrential downpour in the morning. I had to climb up an 85 degree mud cliff with my gear, while it was pouring rain. I'll never do that again lol. I caught about 7 or 8 fish at that spot in roughly 4 hours. After the rain stopped I decided to go check our Wilkes again. First 2 casts I caught 2 smallies on worms, but after that it just dried up. Then the rain hit again and decided to call it a day.  I havent been out on the river for 6+ hours like that in a long time. It felt good and I hope I can do it again soon.  Next time I hope I can find some walleye or bigger fish."

375820,Mike Pike,2009-08-24 14:10:00,1332,Sounds like a nice day on the river!  Thanks for sharing it with us.
375921,d_jordan8,2009-08-24 19:21:00,2,"Hey, maybe next time loose the barbs and the worms/crayfish and do it legal, that is the exceptional waters stretch you where fishing, no live/organic bait, no barbs, and C&R.....pretty straight forward if you ask me.  Derek"
375923,[email protected],2009-08-24 19:32:00,290," What are you talking about? That's not included in the exceptional waters.  Get your facts straight.   Edit: Here is the info Mr. Almighty clear cut.  Fishing regulations  Special fishing regulations have been put in place in part of this section of the Grand to protect the habitat of the species in this section of the river and to improve fishing opportunities. The zone extends from 100 metres below the Highway 2 bridge in Paris to the Pedestrian Walkway and Services Bridge on the north boundary of Brant Conservation Area. This a barbless hook, artificial lure and catch and release zone. This river section is closed to fishing from March 1 to the Friday before the last Saturday in April. Some areas are fish sanctuaries. For details see the regulations for Southwestern Ontario, Map A, Division 4 or visit the MNR website at www.mnr.gov.on.ca.   And if you clearly look at the map, neither of them fall under the special regulations.  Kthanks."

375977,bassman87,2009-08-24 22:04:00,586,  One post in 2.5 years and you just had to be a flamer.
375983,mbosh1980,2009-08-24 22:15:00,349,cockshut...really?
375985,[email protected],2009-08-24 22:18:00,290, Indeed.  There are no special regulations there.  He needs to read more.
375990,mbosh1980,2009-08-24 22:37:00,349,i just thought the name was funny. hey how were you fishing those crayfish? noticed the slowdeath style hook.  You just split shot the line?
375999,bigfish1965,2009-08-24 23:04:00,3382,"I like to use Carolina rig when using crayfish, myself"
376425,[email protected],2009-08-25 20:27:00,290," I used them just like I do worms (which is probably totally wrong lol).  I use a split shot sinker about 5-6 inches from the hook, and just hook it through the tail/midsection.  Usually produces fish, unless the crayfish climbs under a rock at which point im screwed! lol."
