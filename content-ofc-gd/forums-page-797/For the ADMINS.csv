375307,mbac31,2009-08-22 19:23:00,904,I got these the other day as well.  Sexy single russian brides I think. Email is full of them lately.
375311,bigfish1965,2009-08-22 19:30:00,3382,We are aware of the PM's. Just ignore them. The accounts have been removed. Let us know if you get any in the future. It is just part of an email harvest attempt. Don't send the person an email unless you enjoy a few thousand spam emails a day. Thanks for letting us know and we are taking steps to try and prevent it from happening again.
375312,kickingfrog,2009-08-22 19:33:00,8333,"No worries here Rick. I long ago realized the limits of my attractiveness, both physically and financially to the opposite sex."

375322,mj2112,2009-08-22 19:54:00,46,You mean this is a hoax?  This girl was lying to me? She didnt mean anything she said to me?  Damn I thought somebody was looking through some old posts and stumbled upon me and realized I was a great fisherman and wanted to get to know me.  Thanks for ruining my day.  I thought I would be fishing in Russia next month....
375331,Krisco,2009-08-22 20:27:00,67,"If you guys are going to talk about her at least call her by name (Martina) she is a very sweet innocent girl who is just looking for a nice strong fisherman to take care of her, she tells me thats why see contacted ME! I have sent her money to cover her airfare to TO (she said she wll repay once she lands) I am going to pick her up on Thurs and she has offered to clean house for me just until she gets on her feet. Then we will take it from there. I am planning to take her to meet my parents on Friday. Do you guys think that is to soon?  If anyone would like, I can forward you some of her pics, of course only a few as some of them were for my eyes only (she said so)!   Actually Rick, I received her e-mail at 3:17 PM today.
