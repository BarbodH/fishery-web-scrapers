Our road washed out 40 km in ,  (beaver dam broke) a least it meant an extra days fishing. Luckily there was active logging down another road and they were able to redo enough road to get by WE WERE LUCKEY !!!  :D   Rustic"

376005,Muskieman,2009-08-24 23:15:00,2472,"  Sure are!!  If you follow the slot size..and all regs  Gull is a one Walleye a day lake..never got a Walleye from Gull under 60cm. Apparently the Gull Lake record was set in 1986 @ 20lb 9oz. [recently deceased]  H Larabie was the lucky angler..   I've seen an 18lb 37"" back in 1995.  When the limit was 6 and no slot ...a 65lb stringer was not uncommon.  Gull grows an average Smallie of 13-17"" ..and there are tons of 'em Gull also grows HUGE Lakers...but the average fish is not very big mostly 3 - 7 lbs.  RFS  "
