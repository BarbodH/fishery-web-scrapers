375549,oates,2009-08-23 17:04:00,151,"Just curious, I have some I used on Wed. in a tackle box, can I still use this? Will they be effective or should you use a fresh tube each time you fish (Mizmo salt I use)?"
375560,Leecher,2009-08-23 17:33:00,7832,The tubs I use are Berkley's and what I do is put the used one back into the Gulp juice for future use.... it recharges it and is as good as new for the next time I use it Leechman
375562,TC1OZ,2009-08-23 17:39:00,987, I want to get some of those Brekley Gulp baits with the activator crap...looks good on the commercials but so does EVERYTHING....  Are they any good?
375563,Leecher,2009-08-23 17:47:00,7832," White 3"" tube tipped with a dew worm caught me this big cat first time using tubes....    Also this nice sauger    and this rock bass    So to answer your question..... yes it works real good!!! Leechman"
375572,Radnine,2009-08-23 18:33:00,1538,I throw mine back into the bag and let the salt from the other tubes help the tube to recuperate. I usually loose them before I have worry about their potency. Jim
375592,Beans,2009-08-23 19:49:00,3339,My son was here over the long weekend in August and didn/t bring his good rod with him...(figured I had lots)...the one he used had a 2 1/2 inch Phenix smoke colored salted tube on it from last fall...he out did me by catching a 3 lb largemouth with it...  I've had the occasion of having to melt a tube to put it back together after too many hits and catches...

375779,singingdog,2009-08-24 10:09:00,1047,"Well, if Gulp tubes work so well, it seems odd to have to use a dew worm with them  Yes, you can use that tube until it is literally falling off the jighead. Sometimes the torn-up ones work the best. The salt on the outside is to attract fisherman, not fish. Think about it, that salt is probably dissolved within a few seconds of hitting the water. It's the salt impregnated into the plastic that matters."
375782,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-24 10:50:00,2038,Simply lop any used or ripped tubes in the Garbage.........
375826,cranks bait,2009-08-24 14:19:00,721,I keep using mine until they will no longer stay on the hook.   I've even left them on over the winter and reused them in the spring.  The fish they didn't seem to mind one bit.
375827,Mike Pike,2009-08-24 14:21:00,1332,I'm with the rest of the guys who use a tube 'til it's pretty much unusable.  That's the cheap side of me!  lol   I just throw 'em back it the bag with the others when done and they stay salty and moist for next time.  I gob scent on 'em too if I think they need a bit of 'super charging.'
375871,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-24 15:42:00,3761,Those BPS tubes work real well. Mine only last for about 15 fish give or take...then the tentacles are all fallen off. If it was used once and it still sits firm on the tube jig then ur good 2 go!
