Now made in china but I don't think its the cause  Basically when I go too WOT I stall out, not enough too stop the engine but it sputters then when I go back too mid range it works fine. I can go all the way upto WOT for a few seconds then putters. Its not bad fuel as I thought it might be too and replaced it with all fresh fuel.  I think it has something too do with the fuel running out. Where in the chain that occurs is my issue.  AND THE UPDATE ****  After going to Bpro again, they had it on the computer and went through all the testing etc.. Still no cause over and over they tested and could not find the issue..  Then the bright young tech, saw that just prior to WOT the voltage dropped below 12v as the fuel pump sucked hard. He checked the terminals saw some corrosion cleaned them up tried again.. The voltage was just above 12v now..  When I went too the store we chatted for about 30 min if this could be the cause.  Never had a battery issue yet, battery is always charged, finder etc works fine. My Engine also has the pull start option so how can the battery be the issue? This unit also has an alternator?  So, I took the boat down too the water, took it up too WOT and all works great??  On the finder I have the gauge option to see voltage, and just prior too WOT, I am at 14 volts then as it hits WOT I drop down too 12 for a few seconds and then back up too 14 once I am running full out..  They tell me this is normal and it works fine, now  ,"
