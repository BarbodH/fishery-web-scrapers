My buddy is off Dyno Road, so we have fished the hard and soft water seasons there.  All I can say is that it's a nice looking lake.  That's about it.  There are more than just bass to fish in there.  If you can catch them.  The launch is not all that bad.  The parking can get tough if people are not parking properly, especially with trailers.  But enough space at the top beside the hwy for about 6-7 vehicles without trailers.  Good luck.  Let us know how you did there."
