Daughter still has another 5-6 weeks of treatment.  To help things along for all 3 of us, we hopped in the car for a day trip up hwy #6. It is quite a nice drive, except for tornado ravaged Durham. Stopped in Owen Sound to fish from shore and get skunked. Ran the coastal road to Wiarton. Absolutely beautiful. Had forgotten how enjoyable road trips are. The fresh air and exercise is good for us as well.  A few pics:   Indian Falls   Bruce Caves  Even stopped and fished some Saugeen. We caught lots of big chubs. Nothing else., but the daughter and I had fun while the Mrs. napped.  Great way to spend a day without any worries."
