375256,FISHINGNUT,2009-08-22 14:16:00,253,"Any one use bright coloured senkos chartruese, lime green,orange  ect,ect ? I  usually stick to the natural colours in clear water and darker colours in stained water black ,blue maybe a little chartrues on the tail but never the entire bait.I think the brightest colour I would have would be pink and that works clear or stained water.I was just wondering if any one finds BRIGHT COLOURED baits effective .

375269,PikeMolester,2009-08-22 15:25:00,428,chartreause and white Yammy's are m by senko for sure. I dunno about those pink ones tho either...

375445,Lunatic,2009-08-23 03:59:00,536,"A few weeks ago my friend and i were out on a lake and none of us were having any luck. he switched to a weedless worm that was black,or maybe it was a very dark purple.....but it had a pink tip. i switched to a crank bait, his first cast and he landed the largest bass of the day."
375471,singingdog,2009-08-23 09:51:00,1047,"Pink can be a killer on bluebird days. It's tough to make yourself try it the first few times, but sometimes it's the only color that works. I have some lemon yellow ones that I got in a trade that I haven't forced myself to throw yet."
376004,Ramble,2009-08-24 23:11:00,713,"All this tripe about pink not being a MAN colour. If it catches the biggest fish of the day you are ""the man"". If you catch the most fish in a day you're ""the man"". We hammer walleye on pink grubs in teh summer and i get some people who refuse to use them untill i'm out fishing them 4 to 1. Don't hold back on a colour cause you're afraid of it. If you're afraid of a colour lol..... you're NOT ""the man"".  Pink senko's work pretty good. I've only used them in clear water a couple of times and ran out both times lol.  -Dave"
