375009,PikeMolester,2009-08-21 20:52:00,428,can we get another area for NON-fishing threads like these. I think its nonsense to have fishing threads and random threads mixed in one spot on a fishing forum
375011,timmeh,2009-08-21 20:55:00,609,"I'm sure you'll enjoy the show, the amp is a great place to see a concert and Pearl Jam always puts on a great one. I caught them the last few times they've been through town but couldn't make this one."
375012,[emailÂ protected],2009-08-21 20:56:00,290,My girlfriend was just at the Amphitheatre last night for Kenny Chesney.

375082,Joey,2009-08-21 23:38:00,9122,"Have fun, I would love to seem the one day.  It sold out in minutes.  Should be a great show.   Canucker, he'll probably be drinking like a fish so, there, its now fishing related"
375086,dheitzner,2009-08-21 23:42:00,314,"I've seen them 4 times both indoors and out, and each time was better than the last. Couldn't get tix to this one and I'm not dropping 3bills to a scalper. I'm sure you'll enjoy the show immensely. Have fun!"
375122,PikeMolester,2009-08-22 00:47:00,428,"who cares about post count. Make the off topic section NOT increase ur post count. Thats how it works on  another forum im on with over 50,000 people and its fine."

375162,Kenny G,2009-08-22 02:55:00,118,"Saw them at Molson park in '92 Lollapalooza . Other bands were Soundgarden, Janes Addiction,Ministry,Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Wow what a weekend I think!!! STP were on a side stage as well and Rage against the Machine. Kenny G."

375489,markiemark70,2009-08-23 13:17:00,158,"Concert was great! I was 18th row on the floor dead center. Pearl Jam is my other obsession:this was my 13th time seeing them. My wife and I took a road trip last year with our then 1 year old and her parents to NYC to see them at Madison Square Gardens last year. They were awesome as usual on Friday, although I found the sound a bit off for most of the first set, but it always takes me a while to get used to the sound in large venues."
375797,anders,2009-08-24 12:59:00,1168,"Thats sick...i was asked to make the trip down to see them this past weekend, but already had plans.  They were my first....absolutly love them!!"

375836,highdrifter,2009-08-24 14:31:00,2534," Saw them back in 03 at Molson Amp...  Eddy started his set with ""Release""..  I can still feel that wave of sound wafting up to the lawn section..  It was an amazing show!!!  I have the 2 disk set from that show and pop it in once in a while.  He even did a little hippy-esk survey about the war in Irak.  I went something like this:  ""Do you support the US sanctions taken in Irak.""  ""NO, I don't support the war, and I believe the threat of weapons of mass destruction was distorted and exagerated in order for the American people to support the war.""  ""YES, I'm an idiot!!!""  cheers HD"
