375661,Cudz,2009-08-23 22:57:00,2652,"That Nitro 290 sport at BPS is a real real good looking boat.  Fiberglass 19.5'  225 merc proXS. 15hp kicker.  cool jump seats in back.  So far it might be my favourite fishing/family boat.  Very smart looking indeed. Only problem for me is that I come up $60,000 short"

375696,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-24 01:10:00,2038,  Well....  If thats all is required...........i'll take two of them....
375718,Dutch,2009-08-24 01:57:00,831,Nitro has been plagued by poor customer service and very bad re-sale values in the states due to their build.  Bad build = lots of calls and warranty work = bad customer service due to calls and warranty work not being handled the way people expect.  There are better choices out there.  Ranger Stratos Triton  Take your pick.
375772,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-24 04:41:00,947,One Ranger please
375958,fishinfool,2009-08-24 21:04:00,366,"My bud who I do the odd tournament with has a Nitro with a 225 Optimax on it and for the last two years has had a de-lamination problem with his hull on five (5) count em five, separate occasions. He is now looking at taking them to court to do the repair properly. Apparently they have been re-glassing without actually replacing the stringer (shortcut fix) and the fix has been half assed. He also had them repair a lot of spider cracks all over the boat after two years of service. If I were looking to purchase something with a price tag that high I would be looking at Ranger or Princecraft, IMHO."
375976,misfish,2009-08-24 22:03:00,29133,Yep we looked at it last Thursday.LOOKED.
375980,ecmilley,2009-08-24 22:12:00,2163,+2 on the ranger
376000,misfish,2009-08-24 23:06:00,29133, Might want to talk to Ranger owners.They have had issues aswell.
376007,dave524,2009-08-24 23:23:00,4508,"For that kinda money I'd rather have something like this, and have $20G left to blow on electronic and other goodies.  http://www.donhydemarine.com/searchengine/...rtDir=DESC&  BTW that includes a T top with rocket launchers . yes please"
376038,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-25 00:32:00,3761," My first real boat will need to be a Triton...nothing huge maybe a 16-18' boat with something in the  one hundred's for HP  As for that 290 by nirto, would love to get it for free but would never buy it myself."
376193,Jer,2009-08-25 12:04:00,1426,  You might want to save some of that $20G to put a motor on that baby. Looks like $40G just buys the boat.
