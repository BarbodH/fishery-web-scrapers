375853,muddler,2009-08-24 15:09:00,623,"Irented it. I wasn't to impressed by it.  I played for half an hour and got bored. Cast, set the hook and land the fish.  maybe these's more than that to it but I didn't have the patience for it.  muddler"
375869,rbaquial,2009-08-24 15:33:00,968,"I have this game for the Xbox360. Lemme just say... ITS TERRIBLE!! The only reason why I got the game in the 1st place, was because the game was on sale for $20! Man, I should've just saved that money and bought a couple Lures or something!!  I wouldn't recommend renting it. Its THAT terrible! Checkout some REVIEWS on the game, and you'll understand."

376097,fishinguypat,2009-08-25 02:14:00,547,this kind of product is usually bad but in the xbox 360 magazine it got a prety good score sayin it did what you wanted it tto do and it felt bedder than just making a few movements
376113,Lunker777,2009-08-25 02:42:00,866,You can tell in the video that the graphics are just like the rest... horrible.....  I always get pumped up for fishing games.... and I always get let down.  I wont be able to try this one unless they come out with it for PS3
376135,wask,2009-08-25 03:42:00,174,"Fishing games haven't advanced since the old Sega Bass Fishing, whcih was good for its time.  I just tried the newest fishing frenzy game from Rapala and was bored after a few casts.  Sucked.  Was really disappointed."

376199,mepps,2009-08-25 12:27:00,1301,"a rental for sure! The only wii fishing game I like is ancient - SEGA Bass fishing. Not the best looking, but the gameplay is addictive."
376204,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 12:31:00,987,"Me and my wife have been slaying some 17 Lbs bass in Super Nintendo's ""Super Black Bass Fishing""...one of my all time favorite games.  I figured since we enjoyed that so much I may as well pick something up for the Wii. But now that I see this new BPS game coming out in September I'll just wait for that...  With the rod action looks like I'm one step closer to getting my wife to come out with me hahahaha! Soon...soon."
