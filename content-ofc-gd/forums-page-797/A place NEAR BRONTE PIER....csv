Was always curious if that place is open to the public? fishable?  Here's the link to the place I'm talkin' about...  http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&...1&encType=1  If anyone knows, I'd appreciate it!"
375462,Dean Ellison,2009-08-23 04:47:00,39,"Us Burlingtonians used to call that Shell Pier. I'm not sure if it's Petrocan or something else, but I seem to recall that looking at it from the water, it is strictly used for tankers to unload fuel. I don't think there is public access. But I could be wrong  ."

375482,bassman87,2009-08-23 12:09:00,586,"Nope, closed to the public."
375494,Fang,2009-08-23 13:34:00,1330,Have wanted to check out this area for smallies by boat but have been told by more experienced lake fishermen that employees watch for recreational boaters and will sccot you out of the area if you get in their close.  Safety first when there's any possibility of one big tanker being in the area
