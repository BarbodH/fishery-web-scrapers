375041,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-21 22:12:00,0,  absolutely!!! the picture unfortunately was taken on my cellphone and doesn't show how silvery it was... almost like a laker!
375215,HTHM,2009-08-22 11:25:00,4082,"Educate me please....what is the difference between a brook trout and a coaster? Is coaster a slang name for a type of trout? If it is a char, does it turn a brilliant red as well? Beautiful looking fish!"
375216,Spiel,2009-08-22 11:29:00,9065,"Coaster / Brook Trout, same fish HTHM. Coaster"
375231,Fish Farmer,2009-08-22 12:28:00,2234,"And here I thought you guys were talking about someone from the East Coast. I've been called a Coaster, sometimes werser"
375242,solopaddler,2009-08-22 13:00:00,8605,Beauty fish. Would you happen to know Pete Addison? I know he worked on the assessment program as well.
375292,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-22 17:57:00,0,  There's nobody by that name these days but I've only been around the office for 4 years. Cheers!
375418,Greencoachdog,2009-08-23 02:44:00,8163,"  Looks more like a bleached out ""Floater"" than a Coaster to me!!!    ... do you just know how to take and post one pic per trip?"
375452,Dara,2009-08-23 04:11:00,3052,  some people kids...boy oh boy  nice fish Dr.
375459,danc,2009-08-23 04:34:00,4677,This thread seems to be begging for a coaster photo. Here's one.  
375508,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-23 14:34:00,0,that's a huge brookie danc... laid straight and with the tail piinched it looks like it would have gone 24.5... i'd like to actually get out fishing for them one day when i'm not working! is that a lamp scar or?
375591,Wes Bender,2009-08-23 19:49:00,105,"Holy cow, that is a horse Dan. HA! I can't even imagine the scrap it put up. Since we are posting coasters here are a few from yesterday. These were caught while stripping flies in the surf of Lake Superior.  21""   17""   18"" "
375655,Greencoachdog,2009-08-23 22:44:00,8163,  Now those fish look like they're actually alive!!!... beautiful colors!!!
375658,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-23 22:51:00,0,don't you have a relative you should be impregnating?
375660,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-23 22:54:00,0,or have you moved on to goats now?
375662,Greencoachdog,2009-08-23 23:01:00,8163,  I only have one living... and he's a Pencil Neck like you... so I'll be passing on that.    Goats is for plumbers from Virginia... they remember their birthdays and post them on the internet!
375712,backbay,2009-08-24 01:32:00,773,"Couldn't agree more, one of the most beautiful fish in existance. Reminds me of when I was really little, about 6 or so, when my dad used to take me to Glen Haffey to fish for specs. They were smaller than these ones"
375756,Wes Bender,2009-08-24 03:12:00,105," very much so. All hooked in the jaw and release unharmed. We have some good size restrictions up here that prevent the killing of brookies this size. We are allowed none under 22"" for brookies in the Nippy as well as coasters in superior and any trib up to first barrier to migration. They could have been 24"" and they still would have been release. Way too valuable a fish to eat or hang on the wall. You want to eat trout, bonk a laker from any lake but Superior and you have some good eating."
375763,danc,2009-08-24 03:42:00,4677,"I'll tell you once again Wes. Those are fantastic photos. Unfortunately for me, I didn't catch the fish in the photo that I posted. A good buddy caught it, so I can't comment on the fight. Probably a 7lb. fish., or 9, maybe 10 lbs. on the Thunder Bay scale.  I find that the fish in the 20"" range will take the drag screaming runs, and the bigger ones will just bulldog on you.  And Doc, it's a Lake Nipigon fish, so not a lamprey scar."
375834,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-24 14:29:00,0,ahhhhh...i thought it was a coaster!  silly me!
374257,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 20:38:00,0,it's nice of your dad to take you fishing danbo but it probably warrants its own thread!
374277,danbo,2009-08-19 21:52:00,2646,"Thanx bro,,,He's dead..but I can take a joke. (unlike U!)"
374407,wallacio,2009-08-20 03:43:00,475, No worries...I'll post it up on all teaser posts such as this!!!

374443,cambo,2009-08-20 11:45:00,62,Congrats on the brookies and coasters do you fly fish or are you using live or artificial. Would love to see the coasters returning to Manitoulin but I think only the odd one still makes the journey.
374445,Roy,2009-08-20 11:53:00,13728,"They say that Dr. Cook's 14.5 lb speck was a coaster as well. That was back in the days when Thunder Bay was known as Fort Williams. 34.5""... can you imagine?"
374447,Wes Bender,2009-08-20 12:19:00,105,"Dr. Cook's 14.5 lb'er would have been more like 17 to 20 lbs if it was weighed officially that day. He had to walk back out from a 2 week camping trip and the fish was very badly decomposed when it was brought in for weighing.  At least that is what I keep reading. Still, a 14.5 lb'er would be an awesome sight. I was aww struck being in the presence of 6 and 7 lb'er this summer. I never caught them. "
374464,Roy,2009-08-20 12:55:00,13728,"What a great picture Wes, congrats!"

374642,highdrifter,2009-08-20 20:55:00,2534," Nice fish, poindexter!!"

374977,troutologist,2009-08-21 19:39:00,951,"Nice fish Luc. Looks like you're playing a ""C"" down on the caudal peduncle. How do they sound?  Not too many catfishes in Eureka...diverted due to weather and no fishing for me there either. They have a bar and I got to watch a live nature show. Wolves chasing rabbits while drinking the first beer in 3 weeks.  Gotta be a few coasters on the NE shore somewhere....gotta put some effort in sometime"
374987,craigdritchie,2009-08-21 20:01:00,1586," There do indeed be a few coasties along that coast. But it's all about doing the legwork. No work, no play."
373527,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-17 19:13:00,0,"Today was epic.  I spent my lunchbreak today fishing a small rock point near nipigon ontario.  in 20 minutes my coworker and i managed to hook into 5  coaster brook trout, landing only 2 (perhaps due to the barbless hook, perhaps due to our excitement)... Mine was approx. 2 lbs, his was about 3 lbs.  one fish I lost at the side of the boat was easily 5 lbs. After spending 2 seasons working on a coaster habitat assessment project it was nice to finally catch and release one... Pics to come later today!  Gotta get ready!  Going to fish the nipigon river TONIGHT!  "
373529,camillj,2009-08-17 19:21:00,1988,Nice .. I am envious !

373781,wallacio,2009-08-18 15:52:00,475,  C'mon - let see them
373845,troutologist,2009-08-18 19:07:00,951,Agreed dude. Quit sitting there collecting your per diem and show some char.
373867,anders,2009-08-18 20:15:00,1168,I second that notion...i know whats its like...and your off right now...unless........this is a fish story...........
373923,danc,2009-08-18 23:21:00,4677," As you know, Doc, there's been lots of hard work done with the Nipigon Brook Trout situation in the past couple of decades. The most recent reg change, one fish over 22"" as opposed to two fish over 18"", has me really excited. I really noticed this reg change paying big dividends last year. About half the fish that I caught were 22""+, when in years past it was maybe 1 in 10 or 15 fish. Perhaps even less. I remember sitting in a meeting with a Lake Nipigon angling club that were very disgruntled with the new rule change at the time that it was introduced. I just sat there biting my tongue, thinking that I might get mobbed if I spoke in favor of the new reg. They were all very much against it. I've been fishing Brook Trout on the Nipigon system for about 25 years. It just keeps getting better every year. I've talked to a few old timers that have been fishing the system for decades longer than I have. They say that it has never been better that it is today. For a fish that demands the cleanest environment that nature can produce, that's a pretty good success story. Now, if I could only find the time to get out and catch a few of them, life would be very, very good...  Enjoy your time on the planets greatest Brook Trout factory."
373944,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 00:16:00,0,"the reg change seems to have definitely paid dividends on both the coasters and the brookies above alexander and up to the lake. interestingly though i haven't caught a fish over 22 yet from the river...we caught some gorgeous fish that were between 20-21.5 with a huge assortment of girths, but i've yet to break the 22 inch mark!  it's neat to see the morphological differences between the coasters and the others. being a brook trout fanatic, there is no better place to be than nipigon."
374111,anders,2009-08-19 13:05:00,1168,"Dr Luc!!  I cant help but notice that you replied back to this thread, yet, there are not pictures of the so called ""coasters"" you have claimed to have caught!!!  I am starting to think that some the TFM may have been ingested during your lunch hour, which made it seem like you were fishing.  Dammit already...show me the pics!!!!!!!!!"
374115,troutologist,2009-08-19 13:16:00,951,Could be he was just at the bar and found these coasters under his beer?
374126,anders,2009-08-19 13:34:00,1168,"I heard thats a problem up there...but if i know those guys he's with the beer are not on the table that long...would be called ""nursing it"" if it was on a coaster...lol"
