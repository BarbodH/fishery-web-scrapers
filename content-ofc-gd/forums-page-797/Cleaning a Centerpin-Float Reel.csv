375922,rbaquial,2009-08-24 19:29:00,968,"Hey Folks,  I've just recently started Float Fishing - Just a quick question... is there a PROPER way to clean a CENTERPIN? (aside from dunking it in the river, and giving it a good shake while spinning).  Back when I bought my Matrix (By Raven)... I don't ever recall getting an ""assembly"" picture or any sorts, or anything like that?  My question is...  1) Is there a way to clean out the CenterPin? (properly)  2) How often does it need to be greased/oiled?  I know this question seems n00bish, but I wanted to ask. (being my Centerpin never came with any sort of paper work & I'm new to this style of fishing)  Thanks A2F"
375932,drwxr,2009-08-24 20:05:00,453,quick question: do you press search button ever?
375936,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-24 20:18:00,0,i've heard that lubing it up with molasses and rolling it in sand works nice.
375940,BillM,2009-08-24 20:25:00,17367, Smooths out the tolerances quite a bit.  It will spin forever after that!
375960,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-08-24 21:06:00,1107,I just wipe mine clean with a soft cloth and blow it out once or twice a season with the compresor mine has packed bearings so it doesn't need to be greased grease actually slowed it down quite a bit before I asked at the store I bought it from good luck and enjoy your pin.
375963,silvio,2009-08-24 21:12:00,433,Catch a dirty male chinny and use its natural lubricant... just dont get any on you it stains. LMAO  to answer your question wipe it down and put some sowing machine oil on the bearings. you can also soak the bearings in lighter fluid and then put some sowing machine oil on them.
375967,Jet,2009-08-24 21:26:00,364,"I soak my bearings in Kerosene (since mine are new like yours only for a hour or so), pat them dry and add a few drips of sewing machine oil - Singer if you want specifics. Got that tip from a very experienced solo pinner on this forum  I lube mine when I feel its necessary. If I've had to dunk it a lot on a trip I'm more likely to check the bearings.  Aside from that a soft cloth with some light soapy water will do the job cleaning the spool of sand, dust and roe juice that will inevitably find its way on your reel."
376100,rbaquial,2009-08-25 02:23:00,968," To answer your question: YES... but because I was @ work, I am limited to certain websites. Thus, why I wasn't able to do the search. I thought I would ask while I was @ work, otherwise I know I'd forget later!"
376107,solopaddler,2009-08-25 02:36:00,8605," LOL! (He meant a search on this forum, not a general google search. Even so a general google search on cleaning bearings isn't likely to cause any pornados on your work computer.  )"
376108,rbaquial,2009-08-25 02:37:00,968,"Ha! Ooops! Sorry Ekfa! LoL  Well, even still.... results on the forum should still be the same off google; either way."
