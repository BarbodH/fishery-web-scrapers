375611,Dean Ellison,2009-08-23 20:54:00,39," Go with the 4.6L, for the difference in fuel economy you'll get a much stronger engine. My Tritons 12yrs. old, 4.6L with a 5spd. The 4.2L had some gasket problems."

Most parts manufacturers make parts for both Toyota and Ford. Toyotas may be assembled in Texas, but they are still Japanese to me. Built Ford tough for me!!!  "

374406,Jonny,2009-08-20 03:36:00,1380,From the title I thought you might be getting serious about a girl.  Why would you want a truck with mud on it that you can't wash off?
374438,Fisherman,2009-08-20 11:21:00,7201,"Now, now Brian, I realize that as we get older, sometimes we regress a bit to our younger years and get things more fit for a ""young"" person.  you can't retrieve your youth and beauty sleep doesn't work."

374724,danbouck,2009-08-21 00:02:00,4380,Does is come with CAA
374806,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-21 12:00:00,1022,If you want to scare youself away from it look at the fuel consumption specs.
374809,Terry,2009-08-21 12:03:00,14456,a painter must have owned it and splashed some black paint on it....I guess they will discount it for that
374826,Cudz,2009-08-21 12:35:00,2652,"I think if you wait a bit the raptor will come with fords new 6.1 liter engine.  Pretty serious offroad potential from a stock pick up.  Lots of susp travel and comes with 35"" tires. Have yet to see one on the road.  Pretty $$ though"
374842,aplumma,2009-08-21 13:14:00,6896,Never buy a truck with a 4 letter word n it's grill....    Art
374867,Fish Farmer,2009-08-21 13:51:00,2234,"A least you don't have to be worried about it getting stolen. It's a Ford  . Thats why I own one. Mines an FX4 off road crew and it has a 5.4 Triton. It gets between 20 to 21 MILES to the GALLON on the HWY which I figure is not bad, city I don't want to know  . I try and keep it 2000 or under rpm. on the HWY. I wish I'd went the 4X4, a little softer ride. But a heads up on the tires price, I have the 18"" $350.00   each compare to the 16"" $130.00. Good luck on your new ride."
374930,misfish,2009-08-21 17:20:00,29133,"Ford said they would have one on the lot,come September.  As for the price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  60-72,000 dollars.  Im back to looking at the smaller ones.LOL"
374936,blaque,2009-08-21 17:30:00,2419," Have the XLT supercrew 18"" wheels......and im coming up on a need for tires. A little tip. Dont forget that free full size spare under the bed of the truck LOL. Ill be buying 3 and using the freebee underneath and having one of the old ones put back underneath as a spare."
374939,blaque,2009-08-21 17:33:00,2419, way to keep your finger on the pulse of the economy ford LOL  Fear Of Recession? Dont think so
375222,Fish Farmer,2009-08-22 12:02:00,2234," Blaque That's exactly what I did. Thanks for the tip anyway, may help someone else."
375321,bigfish1965,2009-08-22 19:54:00,3382, Seriously??? For a pick up?? I'd be afraid to drive it let alone haul anything with it!!

375407,2 tone z71,2009-08-23 02:13:00,1311,"have ya looked at a  F150 Lariet crew or a SD Lariet  lately, a new loaded Silverado,55K is the norm,once they get the first scratch or dent its all downhill from there anyhow"
375409,pike slayer,2009-08-23 02:16:00,1177,"oh ya drive through the bush with that truck listening to the branches slide across the side of the truck, it would make a grown man cry!"
