375541,pike slayer,2009-08-23 16:23:00,1177,this is an inland lake and the chances of a goby getting in there are very small unless someone plans on using one as bait. i think this bird season i'm gonna stop at the lake real quick with my 20g and see if that does anything haha! this lake is usually an awesome smallie/walleye lake and i would hate to see it turn to crap.
375626,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-23 21:28:00,0,"the tilleys are heavily pressured.  if fish stocks crash, i'd look at angling pressure before i'd blame the cormorants or a ""bad spawning year""..."
375711,pike slayer,2009-08-24 01:32:00,1177,"tilley does get hit pretty hard but its been getting hit hard for the past 20+ years since ppl have been able to get in there with trucks. my grandfather told me stories about back in the 40s-50s when they just got to the tilleys and he was one of the first guys being on the lakes being a part owner of the property and hiring loggers to go in get pulp and he said it was unbelievable fishing. anyways for a lake being constantly hit for so long why would it just fall through now, i say pressure has actually been down a bit cause of the launch is getting worse and hardly anyone has the guts or a truck to make it back up and having to go down the creek and portage over the beaver dam leaves the not so hardcore fisher ppl going else where."
375806,johnnyb,2009-08-24 13:25:00,3413,I dunno....if it's accessible...    I'll bet a devoted group of poachers could do some serious damage...
375835,oates,2009-08-24 14:30:00,151,"I've found the same on the Grand and maybe the Thames. Not catching many but when I do, they are 3lb+"
375855,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-24 15:16:00,0,"  that lake is SOOOOOO easily accessible...i'm not sure what you mean by the ""not so hardcore"" fisher people because anybody willing to carry a boat 75 metres or run a canoe down a short creek can fish it.  hell, 2 winters ago I went icefishing there in a toyota camry.  if you can drive RIGHT to a small lake in winter, in a toyota camry, chances are LOTS of people fish it."
375946,pike slayer,2009-08-24 20:43:00,1177,"i was saying less ppl must go there with the creek being damned up and the launch a complete mud hole but ya it still gets hit hard but its been like that for 20+ years, why would it just fall out and not be able to take the pressure now? and most ppl fish walleye in there not bass. i personally think it isnt fishing pressure unless natives decided to net it."
