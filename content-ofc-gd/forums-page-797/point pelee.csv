375669,beertech,2009-08-23 23:24:00,118,Well I went down that way to muskie fish sat but way too rough to get on st clair.   So I launched out of wheatley and tryed bass on erie.  Couldn;t find  structure or rocks anywhere out there. Gps showed humps and stuff at pellee point on the gps but didn;t move a fish.  Where do they find bass out there is my question
