376157,hoot33,2009-08-25 05:34:00,93,"I was out at the local river tonight (Ottawa River), haven't done my research on it yet but I had to get out of the house so I grabbed my gear and went for a walk.  I arrived at a nice opening in the river, all rock with a fairly steep drop off about 10 ft into the water.  Like I said I haven't done m homework on this area, but knowing there are bass here I started with a scumfrog, tossing it into the thin weeds popping stopping popping reeling, one gentle hit later I decide to change up to a texas rigged senko.  The sun was disappearing fast and I was having zero luck with this too, tried a weedless craw, slowly dragging the bottom, nothing.  All of a sudden a huge splash to my right, fish started jumping for all the bugs on the surface, I ran and grabbed a large black hula popper.  Tossed my popper, pop, pop, pop, pop pause, pop pop pop pop WHAM! big hit. Fought hard, I originally thought it was a pike, couldnt even see the waters edge at this point.  Dragged the fish out and held it to the ground while I grabbed my cellphone from my pocket (poor planning) Turned the light on it and was presently suprised. This is my first ever walleye.  Taking a hook out with one hand on your cell phone one hand on your pliers and zero hands on the fish is not easy.  Got the hook out and took a few pics, keep in mind it was night and they are from my cell.    The first pic is him flopping away while i try to snap a shot. I would estimate it at about 22"" 5 lbs, but that is an uneducated guess as this is my first.  Im pleased with the day though will be going back tomorrow a little earlier for some more action."
376159,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-25 05:36:00,0,fun stuff. my largest 'eye came as an incidental catch on a full size zara spook.   fishing's funny like that.
376160,Cudz,2009-08-25 06:25:00,2652,They will hit at the surface but it is very uncommon.  Good job. not sure how accurate your guess is though.
376164,hoot33,2009-08-25 06:41:00,93,Its probably pretty inaccurate lol I couldnt see a damn thing. 
376173,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-25 09:39:00,2582,"Good job. Those ""surprises"" are part of what makes fishing so much fun.   I dunno...one lake I fished every year for years we got just as much eyes on surface lures after dark as bass. From that experience I assumed it was pretty common. Maybe some others can chime in with there experiences."
376182,Jer,2009-08-25 11:21:00,1426,"I fish top-water alot...probably too much.  Over the years I have caught a total of one walleye on a top-water bait...so I would say not that common at all, at least for me."
376183,Cudz,2009-08-25 11:37:00,2652,More likely at night than in the day but still not the preffered or common method for get eyes at night.  Most people will troll a rapala type lure or use a slip bobber rig with live bait (or whip fishing in some river systems).
376185,Radnine,2009-08-25 11:44:00,1538,"Talk about a detailed report!! Nice job. Get yourself one of these hat lights. They are priceless at night. Jim PS. This is me holding a 7 pounder. Just kidding. I don't think yours was quite 5, but it was a beaut! "
376187,Roy,2009-08-25 11:46:00,13728,"Great report, Hoot! Interesting too!   You're a better man than I am, Jer. I enjoy topwater action and often fish that way. I've got to say that in the 55+ years that I've been fishing, I've never taken a walleye off the top. The only thing I can make of it is that bass and pike don't see so well and must rely on sound/surface disturbance to zero in on their prey. Walleye on the other hand, because of their low-light vision can easily get the meals they need just cruising the entire water column. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  Thanks again Hoot."
376221,Headhunter,2009-08-25 12:56:00,5703,"Nice to catch a Pickereye on the surface! Congrats. My only experience catching them on the surface has been in and around the fall frog migration, when they start moving at night, toward their winter hideouts. Can be a lot of fun. Thanks for the report! HH"
376227,Harrison,2009-08-25 13:08:00,2202," You nailed it Right on the NOSE.  In a couple weeks the super shallows are a blast at night.  Quite common to smack walleye in the pads and slop throughout the open water season.  Feeding on Craws and frogs.  Just don't lip'm, if you can't see'm."
376230,Greencoachdog,2009-08-25 13:10:00,8163,Walleye on topwater at night isn't that uncommon.  Here's a pic of my favorite sociopath holding a nice one he caught on a Hula Popper last September on the West Arm!  
376314,hoot33,2009-08-25 15:28:00,93," ya, Im a slave to top waters as well. Makes me feel like Im missing alot of fish, but when one hits, its so worth it.   lol, ya I need to start bringing a scale with me.  I think Im going to start poppong out of the woods at random parts in the river, try fishing the shallows where there are some more weeds, I want another topwater bass really bad. lol"

376355,ciceri,2009-08-25 17:19:00,535,Looks like a nice average 2-3 pound walleye... good job.
376384,hoot33,2009-08-25 18:07:00,93,"ya lol, he was a good little fight"
376453,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-25 21:16:00,2582,"We used to go to Camp Horizon on Muskosung Lake just outside Sturgeon Falls. Not alot of bass in the lake...compared to the walleye population anyway. My brothers family went there as well but with inlaws and always a different week then us. He told me that out for bass one night they got some nice 3-5 Lb eyes on surface baits...so when we went up next I was determined to give it a try to see if I could get eyes on top water. Managed 2 my very first night and always rigged a rod for surface walleye fishing after that. Got a fish or 2 pretty much every night this way when we went there.  We would do the evening walleye bite the traditional way with jigs and live bait then switch to a bassy weedy area in 6-8 fow for an hour on our way back into the dock. Perhaps the pattern worked because it is not a ""BASS"" lake..I dunno...but it always worked and the walleye taken this way where always of a larger size then the eaters we would normally catch."
376496,hoot33,2009-08-25 22:36:00,93,heading out again tonight to give it another shot.
