375717,Lunatic,2009-08-24 01:56:00,536,I use 30lb power pro braid as well and i use the palomar knot every time.  when i first bought braid line the dude at the tackle shop told me to use the palomar knot with braid. i was using clinch knots before (on my mono lines)
375728,Stern Rules,2009-08-24 02:33:00,342,I use a palomar for tying hooks on my float rigs and an offshore swivel knot when using swivels.
375759,hoot33,2009-08-24 03:24:00,93,"wow,  palomar  knot seems to be pretty popular. I'll give it a shot next time Im out."
375761,Syn,2009-08-24 03:40:00,519," Small suggestion: google fishing knot strength and read a few threads before you decide. Also some knots slip much easier than others. I remember when spiderwire fist came out there was a knot (I can't rember it now) that would consistently slip until the knot became undone. This was because the spiderwire was so slippery. So the moral I learned was ""chose your knot based on the fishing line type you use."""
375770,Jonny,2009-08-24 04:35:00,1380,I've been using the improved clinch knot for mono ever since I was a kid. I can practically tie it blindfolded.  Palomar for everything else.
375796,bigzinc10,2009-08-24 12:54:00,38,"Yesterday I used the Uni knot for the first time to tie more line onto my existing line on the spool...the knot seems super strong...however on a few occassions I found that when I cast, as the line is coming off of the spool it will get stuck on the uni knot, thus making my lure fall short.....besides the uniknot what knots are good for attaching line together without causing a hinderance to the line when casting??"
375807,bdox,2009-08-24 13:26:00,329,"I use Palomar from line to tackle, and Triple or Quadruple (depending on line size) Surgeons from line to leader."
375809,TC1OZ,2009-08-24 13:40:00,987,"Double Uni Knot is very strong in my opinion.  Palomar Knot...  Double Surgeon Knot...  Different knots for different applications should be the over all consensus.   If the question was what would your most common knot be, I'd say Palomar."
375810,NAW,2009-08-24 13:42:00,4022,I started using the Palomar last year on the Hard water.  Needed a quick knot to tie so I could get my hands back in my gloves  I use if for almost everything now.
375812,Jet,2009-08-24 13:47:00,364,"I use the Palomar mostly for mono, but double Palomar (double simple bow) for braid. Got that tip from a bass tourney guy and it has prevent slip for me.  I've been using the Fish 'n Fool knot and it is really strong. In my unscientific back yard tests, it seems stronger than the Palomar. Thought I'd try it after it won knot wars 2009. The only thing its a big trickier to get right making sure the double threading in the eye doesn't overlap and the uni-portion of the knot doesn't twist as you tighten when using mono."
375813,Governator,2009-08-24 13:53:00,879,Once I switched to Palomar last summer (from suggestions here) I never looked back.  Unbelieveable how good of a knot that is and so easy to tie.
375872,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-24 15:45:00,3761," I'm with gerritt, unless I'm using a circle hook, then I tie a Snell"
375896,cuzza,2009-08-24 17:07:00,467,"I use the Uni knot for pretty much everything except joining tippets to leaders etc. and loops where I use a surgeons/ surgeons loop.  What do you all use for loops for topwater baits and the like?   You could try leaving longer tails on the knot, say about an inch, that's what I do with stop knots and they go through the rod rings better as well. That said, having a knot in the middle of your main line probably isn't the best idea as it's a weak spot."
375897,hoot33,2009-08-24 17:10:00,93,"right now I use the uni for everything, slipped for the first time 2 weeks ago, lost my frog"
375898,TC1OZ,2009-08-24 17:14:00,987,"I lost faith in the clinch knot when went to cast out my first buzz bait I ever bought, and watched as it continued on further than my line..and down to the bottom of the pond! I almost wanted to jump in after it...I figured I might as well start throwing $10 bills into the lake   I should of probably checked the knot....instead of just casting/casting & more casting...  Either way, I'm renaming it the Clinch NOT!"
375927,cuzza,2009-08-24 19:48:00,467,LOL @ Clinch NOT  Moistening knots before you tighten them stops anything coming undone and stops the line being weakened by getting too hot when you pull the knot tight.
375937,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-08-24 20:20:00,160,palomer is the best
375941,fishinfool,2009-08-24 20:30:00,366," Hey backbay Last year I was in a tournament with a pro on Balsam and could not figure out why he was pulling all the fish in and I was getting nothing! I was using the same jerkbait color, size, everything. I was cranking it in the same speed as him and he was hauling in ten fish to my one. He finally told me that the only subtle difference was the fact that I was using a snap, when I took the snap off lo and behold I started catching as many as he was. Sometimes the subtle differences can make the difference between winning or losing a tournament. I always try now to tie directly to the line even though I hate re-tying over and over just like you but I learned something that day. Just an FYI!  And to answer the original post, I nearly always use the Palormar knot for the my tying."
375599,hoot33,2009-08-23 20:30:00,93,"Usually Ive been know to tie an improved clinch knot, but I was just surfing google and found the trilene and rapala knots, will give them a try next time Im out, whats your preference??"
375606,Gerritt,2009-08-23 20:48:00,6129,palomer hands down

375612,Roy,2009-08-23 20:55:00,13728,They all have different uses.
375613,hoot33,2009-08-23 20:59:00,93, I realize that but which one do you find yourself using most frequently?
375614,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-23 21:02:00,0,i like the palomar knot as it is much smaller and less visible than the clinch knot. also i can remember hank parker testing them head to head with mono on his show years ago and the palomar outperformed the clinch knot by a few lbs on breaking strength.
375615,Syn,2009-08-23 21:03:00,519,"For tying swivel, snap  30 and 50lb braid  on 8-12 mono and 6-10 flouro same knot but I don't double it."
375617,splashhopper,2009-08-23 21:15:00,2931,what knot should I be using on 30lb braided line ( power Pro) ?
375618,Kinger,2009-08-23 21:15:00,351,"I like the Rapala knot for cranks.  Palomer for most other hook/lure tying.  Improved clinch when i don't care about ""finesse""."
375619,Dean Ellison,2009-08-23 21:18:00,39,agreed
375621,wask,2009-08-23 21:19:00,174,  Haha - that's awesome.  I read an article from Hank Parker in Bassin' like 15+ years ago with the same results... that's why I always use the The Palomar Knot.
375623,Leecher,2009-08-23 21:25:00,7832,I use the uni..... toughest knot IMO!!!
375625,hoot33,2009-08-23 21:26:00,93,I just realized I spelled know wrong in the title.  Layed up in bed I dont have much to do but post here and practice knots  Thanks guys.

375632,Dean Ellison,2009-08-23 21:35:00,39, Now I know you did not spell Knot. No?
375637,hoot33,2009-08-23 21:46:00,93,"lol, Now Im completely confused lol.  Im taking hydromorphone for the pain after the surgery, its not doing me any favors lol maybe I should leave the comp alone for a little while lol.  Dylan  p.s. Knot    "
375643,JohnF,2009-08-23 22:13:00,3494, But a loop with Rapalas.  JF
375645,Greencoachdog,2009-08-23 22:19:00,8163,"  Double Surgeons Loop for cranks and some jigs, Improved Clinch for everything else."
375648,backbay,2009-08-23 22:25:00,773,Palomar every time.
375674,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-23 23:33:00,947,"Palomar for lures, jigs etc and blood knot for tying 2 lines together"
375677,JohnF,2009-08-23 23:39:00,3494, I really wanted that knot to work on my minnows  - but it doesn't. Gotta tie a loop on Raps and AC Shiners etc. They just don't move right locked on tight.  JF
375680,BillM,2009-08-23 23:47:00,17367,"I usually use the improved Trilene knot for mono and flouro, the palomar for braid...  I find that if I don't make enough twists with braid while using a Trilene knot, it will slide through..."

375697,backbay,2009-08-24 01:13:00,773,"I hear you, John; that said, I use a leader or snap alot of the time if I'm fishing cranks or jerkbaits, because I change baits often until I feel I've figured out what's working, and I hate re-tying. Also, there are always pike where I fish, so the leader is pretty much a must. I tie direct to the lure for topwater, where it doesn't make any difference to the action."
