375480,StoneFly,2009-08-23 11:57:00,574," Agreed, and myself being a weather guy also, I do know that that it is relatively easy even for the laymen to know the conditions are present for the possibility of one to occur.  Even using simple tools that are accessible to everyone.  Notwithstanding this, when Torndoes are reported to the northwest of a major metropolitan area at 4:30 and no warnings (or watches) issued to the south east until 6pm or later while it is occuring, it doesnt add up.  I wonder how many 10,000's of children were running around wonderland on thursday evening when those tornadoes ripped past it with no warnings given.  As defined by Environment Canada,  A Tonadoe 'WATCH' means the conditions are present for one to occur, a Tornadoe 'WARNING' means it is occuring.  I often wonder if the agenda is more political than anything else.  Slightly different topic, Anyone ever seen a 50% P.O.P ?  its always 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, with the odd time, 10%, 30%, 70% or 90%,...but NEVER 50%."

375499,kickingfrog,2009-08-23 13:59:00,8333,"   I did not read this post until this morning. I could not help myself, I just had to see why it was still around.  Yes, tornadoes do occur at night, but I'll take issue with the way the nighttime fatalities from tornadoes was presented.  I don't have the stats that LiveScience Staff has, but you need to look at all the factors.  1. There is more than 12 hours of daylight during much of year when tornadoes are more likely to occur. So if tornadoes can occur at any time (they don't, see reason # 2) the odds are they will happen in daylight hours more often than not. This makes the sample sizes smaller for nighttime tornadoes, a small number of deadly tornadoes can therefore skew the stats.  2. Tornadoes don't occur as often at night in part do to the heat that is one of the major factors for the formation of funnel clouds. Decreasing the sample size again.  3. Any nighttime tornadoes that don't cause property damage are less likely to be reported because: few people will see funnel clouds due to darkness and fact that they are likely to be asleep. This ""appears"" to increases the number of deadly tornadoes by lessening the number of funnel clouds spotted but not causing property damage and death. Decreasing sample size again.  4. While tornado type weather can be predicted, actual tornadoes and locations are imposable to predict (as stated). Eye witnesses contribute with the spotting of funnel clouds and the informing of the public at large. Again there is less of this during the night due to more people being inside, the lack of light and sleeping.  5. If people are sleeping at night they are not going to hear the radio and/or TV warnings about possible tornadoes in their area. If they don't hear the warnings they will not take appropriate cover, and many of our bedrooms are on the second floors."

375719,danbouck,2009-08-24 01:58:00,4380, bahahaha
375766,Badger Shark,2009-08-24 04:08:00,291," Opening windows does nothing to help in an event of a tornado, it was thought long ago doing this would yes equalize the preassure and in fact while I attended shcool in Kansas back in the 80s we had tornado drills twice a month and part of it was opening the windows.  With more studies this practice was proven useless.\  As for warnings, unfortunately we are not set up for mass warnings like in the states.  Down there they have warning sirens all over the place which will get your attention wheather you have a radio or tv or not.  No powere = not tv = no warning unless you happen to be listeing to the radio in a vehicle, but the sirens are very loud and you do hear them.  Very helpful at night.  I guess since tornadoes are much more rare here it is not worth the expense to set up a similar system.  I will say the sound of tornado sirens going off is one of the scariest sounds I have ever heard, especially at night. You never know after these last 6 confirmed touchdowns maybe they will look into an outdoor warning system, but I doubt it."
375768,Jonny,2009-08-24 04:31:00,1380," OK, good to know, thanks. I knew it wouldn't be a lick of help with a ""direct hit"" - nothing is. I thought it might help with a near miss."
375771,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-24 04:38:00,947,You should ask Myth busters to prove that theory
375816,bigugli,2009-08-24 14:03:00,6138,"Drove through Durham town. yesterday. Folks were still busy at it clearing the debris along hwy#6. The worst hit part of town was still cordoned off and guarded by police.  As for the sirens. There is a lot more involved than simply putting up a few  towers and sirens. The old air raid warning system was derelict for decades before they were torn down. 2/3 no longer worked because they were never tested annually ( didn't want to scare folks ) and there was no regular maintenance. Then you need another layer of emergency infrastructure to track storms and issue the necessary localized warning and set off the alarms. Now, do you set up this advanced warning system for certain parts of the province or province wide. We do have a well known 'tornado alley', but many storms have occurred beyond those parameters. Thorold and Minden come to mind."
376008,StoneFly,2009-08-24 23:27:00,574," Im thinkin that sirens are kindof outdated.  With all of the technology we have, I mean pretty much everyone has a TV, radio, internet and cell phone these days.  I would think there may be an opportunity for some telecommunications wizard to set up some type of application for this, which could also have several other applications.  I guess my original point about the 'Warning's' was that even on the weather network that they were not issued in nearly enough time, when they could have been.  I was texting and phoning friends and families about severe weather coming last thursday, hours before Environment Canada issued anything for the area.  Im also thinking a place like wonderland that has a PA system throughout the entire park could have done something, that tornado was damn close to ripping through there.  Just imagine if it had of.  As I recall, For years since the 1985 twisters, almost everytime there was a nasty system moving in, environment Canada issued a tornadoe warning, but they rarely developed and never near populated areas if they did.  Im wondering if recently it has been more of a case of not 'crying wolf'."
376494,Jonny,2009-08-25 22:32:00,1380,"An ""inquiry specialist"" from environment Canada responded to my emails.

Funny I lived in Kansas for 10 yrs and never saw one but here have seen 3.  Though I have yet to experience a storm as violent as the one that hit our town in Kansas in 1981, not a tornado but the most violent thunderstorm I have ever been in, trees down everywhere through windows, roofs, and dead birds everywhere. All this was caused by violent straight line winds."

375260,Cookslav,2009-08-22 14:36:00,1457,"2 days later and the facts are rolling in confirmed...not that there was much doubt of touch downs. Unfortunatly in all this media hype, and specatular footage caught in Vaughn lets not forget there was an 11 year old boy who lost his life in the Durham Tornado, and several more taken to hospital with traumatic injuries.  Its just Sad that there was little to no warning for these people in the Conservation Area. The Poor Kid was in a picnic enclosure with his mother taking shelter...not that canvass is much protection from flying debris. My heart goes out to the family, and those directly effected.  This was a bit personal for me as I had my trailer in that conservation area 3 years ago, and actually knew the gentlman who was on the scene first performing CPR...for 40 minutes before the Ambulance came. He is a super nice guy, and my heart was breaking for him seeing him on the news last night trying to keep it together. I actually took shelter in his trailer(next door neighbor) with my 2 year old daughter and wife once as there was a HUGE storm that rolled through in mid August 4 years ago(Very similar). He was kind enough to invite us in so Aby could watch TV(which I didn't have) to distract her from the storm which had her pretty scared.  I am now thanking my lucky Stars that I decided to move to another park when I heard of this tragedy. As spectacular as all the Vaughn footage is no one was hurt and thats a miracle in it's self.  I don't know that there was much that could have been done to better warn people of the impending danger, but I certainly hope this event has served as a big wake up call to pay attention when severe weather is forecast.  Cheers,"
375298,StoneFly,2009-08-22 18:26:00,574," The part I dont get is why Environment Canada waits until a Tornadoe is seen before they issue a warning,...I mean anyone with an internet connection can go on the weather network and see the radar and know there is a massive Storm heading South East over Huron and G-Bay, the red and purple colors tell it all.  Then that system spawns a tornadoe at 4:30 in Durham and continues to March South East towards the more populated areas and no tornadoe warnings until its too late.  All of the conditions we had were perfect for a tornadoe, I just dont get it."

375367,solopaddler,2009-08-23 00:07:00,8605, Being a weather guy I can tell you the answer is easy. It's impossible to predict the appearance of a tornado.
375403,Jonny,2009-08-23 02:05:00,1380,"After the events of the day, I sent Environment Canada a couple of messages (one of them appended below). I think they meant Restoule Lake, but a lot of people wouldn't know where that is either.  My second message dealt with the fact that although they have a lot of marginally interesting items on their site, they have nothing about what the precautions should be for a tornado. When they say in their warning ""take necessary precautions"", they don't tell you what those are.  I think that in tornado conditions you are supposed to get as far below ground as you can, or at least be indoors in the center of your house and lie down on the floor if you have no basement (we were ready to get into our crawl space). If I have it right you should also open as many windows as you can (air pressure equalization). Other than that we've never checked. "

She gave us a call, as she said it looked like it was heading our way.  We had already seen the warning on the internet and had opened the trap to the crawl space and had some stuff handy. We watched the lake (we look East toward North Bay) and were ready to jump down in the crawl space at a moment's notice. We didn't see a waterspout or funnel cloud, though, maybe because of the poor visibility.  It was stressful just the same. We had water, blankets, a flashlight, the laptop, external hard drive (both with lots of family photos on them), wallet and purse, cell phone, all set to pull down into the crawl space, and we made sure we were dressed in long pants and had jackets on, even though it was warm.  Environment Canada in its warnings says ""take necessary precautions"". It doesn't, however, mention what those precautions should be. This is not something we have any experience of.
