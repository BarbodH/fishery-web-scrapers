Im not even sure he knows about the gas???  I never talk about it and hes never mentioned it lol.  One time i found a used paddle boat for the kids to use up there. I guess I shoulda told him cause he thought it was stolen and dropped off at his cabin lol.  Ive tried that soup Cliff, its to die for.  And if you make it, I know itll be even better?"

917720,grimsbylander,2015-05-30 20:16:00,3016,"By coincidence, yesterday I was mowing the lawn and the mower engine surged a couple times. It's a John Deere tractor and I thought I'd better check the oil...ya never know. I pulled the dipstick and it looked good. While pondering my next move, my cell phone rang and after a two minute chat, I was back to the tractor. I'll start it up and see if it does it at idle, I decide. Turn the key and it fired up like a champ. One second later I'm being sprayed in the face with warm brown oil and there's a cloud of brown fog so think you can taste it. I managed to get my hand on the key and get it shut down but not before I create a 6 foot circle of sticky slick goo. Yeah, don't run it with the oil dipstick on the work bench. Bright side? After I wipe the tractor down it looked like new! It ran fine right after btw. Of course it did."

917027,captpierre,2015-05-26 16:36:00,2521,"I asked about this mower and got advice last year. Now could be time for a funeral. 4.5 hp Briggs and Stratton small mower.  $150 new. Bought new 5 yrs ago for cottage. Did well for 2 yrs. I have a 15-20 degree slope  to cut.  Mostly cut side to side. A bit up and down. Used some old gas once. May have been 3 yrs old. The problem may have started then. Starts well. Runs at lower rpm than did  initially and sputters all the time.  Worse when moving back and forth. Tried fresh gas. Premium ethanol free gas. Seafoam.  Gas line antifreeze. New plug. Today won't start after half of lawn done.  Fires a bit but won't stay running. Took plug out. Lots of carbon but gap ok. Sanded it clean. No difference. Do I get her repaired ?  Likely not worth while since new one $150. Is the slope to blame?  Get a different engine in a new one?  2 stroke perhaps? Due to the slope a small, light mower is best. This one was perfect until lately What would you small engine guys recommend? Thanks Peter"
917029,fishnsled,2015-05-26 16:56:00,3520,"I'm no expert but it might be the carb and it just needs a good cleaning.  My mower was acting similar about 3 years ago and my neighbour mentioned my carb may need a cleaning.  Googled carb cleaning videos for my motor/HP size and found a couple.  Went the easy route first and dropped the bowl and jets out without removing the carb.  Sprayed it all down with carb cleaner, fine wire poked through the holes in the jets, put it back together and it's been working great since. Only took about a half an hour to do and no costs other then the carb cleaner."
917030,Big Cliff,2015-05-26 17:01:00,6899,"Bring it to Big Cliff!  You are right, bad gas is probably the culpret and Sea Foam won't always fix it. Sounds like the jet is plugged in the carb, easy fix if you know what you are doing (I think I do  )  Ditch shouldn't be much of a problem, those engines were built with an oil slinger in them, as long as you didn't run it out of oil it should be fine.  Cost to repair: including sharpening and balancing the blade, changing the oil, cleaning the carb and fuel system. $25.00 including materials (for OFC people only).  PM me if you want the address."
917031,Walleye72,2015-05-26 17:03:00,156,"It is more than likely that it simply needs a tune-up and carb cleaning.  If you can find someone who is reasonable, it can be fixed for much less than a new one.  As has been discussed here on this forum, looking after a lawnmower these days with all the ethanol in today's gas requires more effort than it did 20 years ago.  My Toro sometimes acts up, where in it starts, but then stops a few seconds later.  If I take the bolt that houses the float bowl out (be careful with the float bowl gasket)  and inspect it, a piece of dirt or whatever is lodged in there.  Clean it up good and put it back together and it's fixed.  If it's 5 years old, it could probably use a tuneup anyways, but it's probably something simple."

917039,fish_fishburn,2015-05-26 17:30:00,1311,Take the float bowl off and clean it out for starters. Prolly full of gunk from the gas sitting in there.

Cleaned the fuel tank, installed new diaphram, cleaned the air filter, adjusted the RPM, checked the spark plug (it was dirty because of the air filter causing it to run VERY rich) touched up the blade and balanced it (it doesn't look like it's had much use), changed the oil (my bet it was probably the original  ) and cleaned it up a bit (pressure washed it).
