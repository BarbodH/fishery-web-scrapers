917402,tb4me,2015-05-28 15:55:00,3295,I do my 18 footer alone..I have a system just back it in undo the front hook grab the anchor rope and push off..once the boat clears the trailer i pull it back in by the rope beside the trailer and tie it to the dock. then go deal with the truck and trailer.. Lol I remember when i was 14 I was playing with grandpas tractor (old ford ) and small short landscape trailer.. was backing the trailer down the driveway and put it down the side of my aunts new Buick.. Man was she ever ticked..My grandpa told her she shouldn't have parked there..lol
917410,John Bacon,2015-05-28 17:08:00,3277,"I can not back up a trailer without turning around. I have tried for hours at a time. A long haul trucker told me you go ahead and do it however works best for you. I even tried taping cardboard over the rear window, no way no how am I able to do it as well as turning around. I am like a  Pit Bull with a bone. I practiced on night shift for many hours and eventually was able to back up a welding machine, but, I had to turn around and see what I was doing.  The trick I was shown or I read it here maybe is to put the right hand on 3 and the left at 9 on the wheel. Think of ""up"" as the action or positive. If you go up with the right, the trailer goes right, up with the left the trailer goes left. If you can't see the trailer in the mirrors you are going straight. And saying it out loud really helps me. Easy peasy nice and easy.  Consistency is more important than the exact method that you use.  Switching between the mirrors and the back window is confusing because the mirrors give you a mirror image of what is happening while the window shows you what is happening.  Most people seem to prefer the mirrors but looking through window should work too.  Swtiching between the mirrors and the window will usually be confusing.  Similarily; if you always place your hands in the same place, you learn how the trailer reacts when you move the wheel.  If you put your hands in a different spot every time then the trailer reacts differently depending on where your hands are placed on the wheel."

I was taking care of some stuff in my boat when this guy pulls up towing a boat and tries to back his boat between two trucks. I thought he must have a camera because his passenger just sat in the truck. Nope, he raked the entire side of a brand new Ford Platinum F150, all because he was too lazy to get some help. Therefore, with this level of incompetence around, the Ford back-up deal had better be idiot proof. Needless to say the owner of the truck was irate."

On the other hand there are ignorant asses out there like the guy on the Grand on Sunday, 45 minutes just to back down the ramp after he butted in front of me and refused help from others waiting. I practiced in the shopping mall parking lot with a seasoned trailer hauler for hours one night. Like Golf and Fishing the more you practice the luckier you get. I can not back up a trailer without turning around. I have tried for hours at a time. A long haul trucker told me you go ahead and do it however works best for you.

Every year for it's entertainment value we go to Hoovers Marina in Nanticoke on the Saturday morning of the Pottahawk bash at Long Point Bay for breakfast. I could submit videos of the carrying on to America's Funniest Videos and win for sure. Then we go for supper there on Sunday to watch them try and get their Dad's 35 foot Cigarette boat back on the trailer hung over like a bunch of grapes. It is an absolute blast and now an annual event, it's the only 2 days you need a reservation for the place. Many of the young women forget to put their clothes on by accident or maybe not. More than one person falls into the water hammered trying to get out of these boats. It can be scary when they do that between the boat and the dock for sure. I could write a book.
