917515,Joey,2015-05-29 14:29:00,9122,"Sweet stuff Drew, I've  yet to catch a crappie    My day will come (although I suppose you actually have to fish for them to catch them  )"

917553,Joeytier,2015-05-29 18:59:00,3990,"Awesome pannies.  Sometimes I wish we had them up here, but the walleye slays help to remedy the pain lol"
917558,misfish,2015-05-29 19:50:00,29133,"Nice, but I throw the yella bellies back if there are crappies to be had. Save them for another dinner trip.LOL  Nice report dude."

I'll give this one a ""very cool""  Made them both a little big Chris for under the float, they did better casting out.  I did forget to add one other ""morning"" fish I squeezed in for crappies.  So I guess it was two full days and three half days.  On that other day I did take a skunk.  Was trying a new waterbody from the float tube, caught OOS bass, bluegills and one crappie.  That crappie I lost tube-side though... so I took a skunk on the intended species.  This year I've had a few misses for sure.  You sure do a lot of fishing  Everyday logged since 2002.  It's absolutely ridiculous my friend.  Sweet stuff Drew, I've  yet to catch a crappie    My day will come (although I suppose you actually have to fish for them to catch them  )  Joey, they're quite easy in the spring.  Locate them and it's usually a slay, and usually they're easy enough to find.  Awesome pannies.  Sometimes I wish we had them up here, but the walleye slays help to remedy the pain lol  Stick with the walleye if you have to choose. lol."

917644,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-30 04:48:00,8243,"Another great Bunk report complete with artwork. We miss our April Crappie feed here. Our spot was a Marina down the lake and it is now locked up like Fort Knox complete with 10' fence. Guys were going in there and leaving all sorts of crap (a pun) laying around, the back breaking straw I was told by the owner was the year they broke up a dock to make a fire. Arse wipes."

Imperial is a little harsh but those tie dyed, hippie sunsets in Mal Pais blew my mind.  Yes man!  Imperial it is.  Down there some years ago with Bren I bought two.  Milked one of them to death.  In any reports (and some still) I'm wearing a black T with the Imperial dragon logo.  Down there last year bought five more and haven't worn a few of them yet.  Beer is OK.. but the shirts are like $5 so why not load up on them eh?  Another great Bunk report complete with artwork. We miss our April Crappie feed here.

Seems when people find a crappie spot there's almost always some sort of drama that ensues.  Up around Ottawa some years ago it was Petrie that made for issues for one local bully and some kids... Silly.  And I too remember fishing the closest lake to me one evening and banging 'em good, keeping only 16 for the table though.  Wasn't 24 hours later I was booted off a website because it was the straw that broke one crappie God's back. lol.  It was his spot and I needed permission for it I guess...  That night there'd been 3 other boats go through there. lol.  Week or so later, my buddy and I were in there again with 6 other boats fishing craps.  All those other people had nothing to do with me or who I talked to... one fella I hadn't even met before did ask us if we had permission from the same so-and-so to fish there.  It's public water man!  My buddy and I just laughed about it, but it's funny how some people just go retarded over crappies... and in your case, the crowds literally come and ruin the fun in a totally different way."
