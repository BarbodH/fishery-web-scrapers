915561,limeyangler,2015-05-18 11:14:00,5204,"Hi all,  Well as usual I was working the morning of walleye opener, but luckily I live on a great walleye lake so I snuck down the front lawn at daybreak and cast for a couple hors before work.  When I got back from work I did the same thing for a couple of hours and was again rewarded with some solid fishing.  All the fish were spawned out. Kept 4 for some food and released a bunch.  Fish were as deep as 9 feet and as shallow as 1 foot.  Slip bobber the most effective method by far, bait medium minnows.                                                                     VIDEO "
