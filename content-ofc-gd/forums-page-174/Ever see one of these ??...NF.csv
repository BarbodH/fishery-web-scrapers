917199,Joey,2015-05-27 14:32:00,9122,"No I haven't Lew, but you're right, she sure is purdy.   Looks like she has a little dog on each wing"
917200,lew,2015-05-27 14:33:00,12766,"Looks like she has a little dog on each wing  Yeah Joey, that's what I thought too."
917201,Roy,2015-05-27 14:48:00,13728,I think it's an Io moth. Very nice.
917238,farsider,2015-05-27 19:49:00,456,"Nice find Lew!  Look what he had hiding under his wings...  http://animaladay.blogspot.ca/2011/05/io-moth.html  Cheers, Mark"
917239,lew,2015-05-27 19:54:00,12766,"Funny you put that picture up Mark because I went out again after posting my picture and that's exactly what I saw, those huge dots on the wings. I went back in to get my camera and he took off.  Really a beautiful critter !!"
917246,Big Cliff,2015-05-27 20:17:00,6899,The absolute beauty of nature and it is all around us if we would only stop and see it. Nice job Lew!
917250,dave524,2015-05-27 20:44:00,4508,"Cool , never seen one of those. As a kid I would find cocoons in the winter of both Polyphemus and Cecropia moths in the woods while rabbit hunting and bring them inside where it was warm and hatch them out. Strange I never got an IO they were all the same family."
917251,mattybculp,2015-05-27 20:58:00,388,kind of looks like a butterfly pattern on the wings very cool indeed
917282,Rod Caster,2015-05-27 23:08:00,5784,"I used to visit the parking lots of the local college at night in the spring; the big lights would attract all kinds of huge and unique moths (up to 4-5""). I miss doing that.  Nice shot Lew"
917293,outllaw,2015-05-27 23:37:00,1232,very Purdy. most folks look but never see whats out there. thanks lew
917296,manitoubass2,2015-05-27 23:46:00,11391,I would have rather have seen that last night!  I was sitting out enjoying some fresh air around 2am and the air was thick with june beetles.  I hate their eradic flying. Scares the crap outta me everytime they land on ya outta nowhere ????
