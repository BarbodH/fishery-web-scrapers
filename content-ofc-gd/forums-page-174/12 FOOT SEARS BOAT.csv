916785,jameshandz,2015-05-25 04:57:00,31,Hey everyone I have a old 12 sears boat that I got when I purchased my trailer . It has no markings or anything for weight or engine size . I'm thinking a 9.9 but it may be to big for this little boat . Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance .
916791,DanD,2015-05-25 10:45:00,2223,I had one of those 12' sears with a 9.9 2 stroke on it; worked real nice together.  Dan.
916792,chris.brock,2015-05-25 11:13:00,4053,"We had one. My Dad said he bought it new. It was advertised as a ""99 pound boat for $99"" or something like that.  9.9 four stroke would be way too heavy. A 6 or 8 two stroke would be better."
916838,KLINKER,2015-05-25 15:49:00,256,"I have one, originally had a fiberglass deck windshield and forward controls, now all stripped down. 6 hp yammy moves it along pretty good when just me in the boat."
916839,jameshandz,2015-05-25 16:06:00,31,"yea , the one im looking at is a early 1979 johnson 9.9 , it would be me and my girlfriend in the boat usually. wouldnt be out much in it alone."
916842,DanD,2015-05-25 16:18:00,2223,"That's what I had on the back of the sears, I could carry that Johnson with one hand, it was so light.  Dan."
916843,jameshandz,2015-05-25 16:27:00,31,YEA IM HOPING TO BE OKAY . WAS GONNA GO WITH A 7.5 BUT MY TRAILERS ON THE TRI LAKES AND I HAVE SO MUCH LAKE TO FISH THAT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND AT A DECNET SPEED
916844,DanD,2015-05-25 16:30:00,2223,It would do around 15mph showing on a GPS.  Dan.
916852,jameshandz,2015-05-25 16:58:00,31,"yea the guy im buying off of says the motor weighs about 60 lbs. so all in all with two people(150 lbs and 105 lbs) prob 10lbs of gear, one 15 L tank and the battery . im hopefully going to  be okay . its a small boat but atleast its a v haul not flat bottom"
916871,davey buoy,2015-05-25 19:47:00,5505,"I had two 12'ers over the years.,If your traveling some distance a 9.9 or similar would be fine."
916878,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-25 21:11:00,10439,My first boat was a 12 footer with a 1963 Johnson 5.5 on it. It was a great little boat and I wish I still had it in my stable.
916882,Joeytier,2015-05-25 22:02:00,3990,"It would have to be a pretty small 12 footer to not be able to handle a 9.9 FS.  My 12 foot wc-12 has a 15 merc, and hits just shy of 24 mph in ideal conditions, and trolls down to around 1.7-1.8 in flat calm weather.  I would definitely opt for the 9.9!"
916884,irishfield,2015-05-25 22:25:00,26272,"If it's a 4' wide ""car topper""... yes it will run great with a light 2 stroke 9.8 / 9.9. Will it be dangerous if you have limited boating experience... quite possibly. Just remember never to turn the engine fully... you can easily flip a 12' car topper with an 8 or larger engine. I've watched my f-in-law do it more than once...  That said, it was exactly what I let my then 16 year old daughter use every day to go to work at Temagami shores. A 12' Reynolds car topper with a 9.8 Merc, with the advise never to turn if fully under high power and she never went swimming."
916885,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-25 22:25:00,8243,"We had a 12' Sears car topper . No problem with a 9.9, if alone we had to put a few blocks in the bow depending on the weight of the driver."
916894,fishindevil,2015-05-25 23:02:00,6254,If it's a car topper 12 foot the transom & sides will be lower than a deep v 12 footer you don't want it to get swamped from the transom by having too big or heavy of a motor on it ?? Just sayin as I have seen it happen before
916895,fishindevil,2015-05-25 23:03:00,6254,I guess irishfield beat me to it !!!  Lol
916898,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-25 23:20:00,10439,We once put my buddies 15 Evinrude on the back of my little 12 footer. It was like driving the Miss Budweiser hydroplane!!!!! It was scary fast with the 15.
916907,chris.brock,2015-05-25 23:58:00,4053,"It would have to be a pretty small 12 footer to not be able to handle a 9.9 FS.

If it's the same one we had, it was as light as a canoe but it would catch wind like a sail. It had a wimpy transom with 1/4"" plywood. I think I remember it was conservatively rated for 5 hp max. 15 hp would be fun to try on a calm day but not for regular use."
917006,jameshandz,2015-05-26 14:21:00,31,THINK IM GONNA GO FOR THE 9.9 SEEN A BUNCH A VIDEOS AND LIKE PEOPLE WERE SAYING AS LONG AS IM NOT DOING TURNS FULL SPEED I SHOULD BE OKAY .  WISH ME LUCK AND THANKS FOR THE INPUT
917101,davey buoy,2015-05-26 22:43:00,5505,THINK IM GONNA GO FOR THE 9.9 SEEN A BUNCH A VIDEOS AND LIKE PEOPLE WERE SAYING AS LONG AS IM NOT DOING TURNS FULL SPEED I SHOULD BE OKAY .  WISH ME LUCK AND THANKS FOR THE INPUT And no registration under 10 hp.Good luck and have fun !!!!!
917128,Canuck,2015-05-27 00:46:00,491,I fished on just like that for the first 25 years of my fishing life. You want a 9.9. I think they are rated up to 10hp. I tried a friends 15 but it was way to squirrelly at speed. It's too short and their flat deadrise makes th fast.
917148,joeybacala,2015-05-27 02:52:00,63,I still have one and with a Suzuki 9.9 on it. With two big adults and gear it moves the boat well. My boat has the coast guard info plate and it is rated for max 10hp. I hope this helps.
