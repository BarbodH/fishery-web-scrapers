WOW.....what a fantastic time (beer). Headed up Saturday morning and arrived around noon. No motors allowed so it was oars and paddles (beer) on this probably 3 sq-mile lake. I opted for a Showbee 6wt with a wt forward floating line and a 4.5lb tippet. I moved back and forth between a Mickey finn and another yellow red and black fly that the name escapes me at this time, while others preferred the spinning outfits. While they did catch a bit more fish, the fun factor was explosive on the fly rod. There was about 35 fish caught between me and my bud over the 2 days. (beer)   Most were returned to the water but some were pretty tasty.  The lodge has a history going back almost 150 years and listening to some of the historians was as good as fishing itself. The lodge was a frozen in time museum of the past. It was awesome (beer)   And of course with ice of last Wednesday, it was a perfect time for a dip (beer)    I have a good batch soaking right now that will hit the smoker tomorrow! (beer)  What a great trip!"

Actually, I was a lone Sens fan in a sea of Habs fans. I took a bit of ribbing! lol  The lake was about a mile long, maybe 1.3 max. and about the same width."

917021,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-05-26 15:44:00,39,"Cool.  Fly fishing is the best, especially when you get into good size fish.  I use my 4-5 wt with 9ft tippets for this kind of fishing."
