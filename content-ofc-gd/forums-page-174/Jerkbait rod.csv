I loved the old generation Crucials but did not like the last generation ( foam split grip ) models. I looked at a few different models of jerkbait rods but I could not find exactly what I was looking for. Some mentioned the Dobyns rods. Very nice rods but a little out of my price range Looked at the St. Croix rods but found the tip to be a little too soft fore my liking Decided on the Crucial 6ft. 8. medium/extra fast.( full cork handle ) This rod will be primarily used for pike and smallmouth fishing. As well as topwaters once bass season starts. This rod has plenty of backbone with just the right amount of softness in the tip to launch small to medium size jerkbaits. The balance with a Chronarch is amazing. A very light comfortable combo. Very happy with the purchase"
