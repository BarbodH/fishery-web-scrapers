Shoulda been good Water 65 on surface. Quite a few mayflies clinging to the cottage. Some green weeds but not much. Getting tired of hotdogs. ?

917144,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-27 02:27:00,8243,Half the fun of a fishing trip is the good food at the end of the day. Eating beaks and asses is not my idea of good food. You may not have control of what you catch but you are in control of what you eat. Remind me not to take you up on a dinner invite.  What were you after as far as fish? What was your game plan for catching them?
