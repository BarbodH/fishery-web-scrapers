916576,SirCranksalot,2015-05-24 13:52:00,3291,Maybe some of you who live nearby can launch their boat and fish the harbour in support of fellow fishermen!      http://www.northumberlandtoday.com/2015/05/21/anglers-asked-to-leave-cobourg-harbour
916580,Gerritt,2015-05-24 14:12:00,6129,"Looks like their at it again! Brutal.....  Good on the boys and on Ron, for saying enough is enough!  G"
916582,Rod Caster,2015-05-24 14:23:00,5784,"Good stuff boys, those pike were hitting hard!  'You're allowed to fish here, but I'm asking you not to"" hahaha"
916590,gino,2015-05-24 15:16:00,400,Bull...as long you're not trespassing and have an ON fishing license you can fish..they don't own the water. Period.
916607,leaf4,2015-05-24 16:51:00,2466,"They handled that well, I'd have told them off lol"
916635,FrankTheRabbit,2015-05-24 19:23:00,479,"Fella kept saying, ""Out of respect,""...respect for whom? Certainly not out of respect for the angler. Agreed, the fellas on the vid kept their cool. That type of situation can quickly escalate to an exchange of words that wouldn't be PG13 friendly."
916645,landry,2015-05-24 19:42:00,1005,Great job guys.
916668,misfish,2015-05-24 20:48:00,29133,"I went through the same thing here at the Barrie marina years ago. They called the police and they had no answer for the caller. There is no charge. Come here when  perch are in, you will see boats sitting there.  Good on them for keeping cool and kept on fishing."
916680,Sour_Squirrel,2015-05-24 21:20:00,196,Now really.  What can the turd at the Marina really do if those guys would would stayed there to fish? I don't think the police would have done anything as no laws were being broken.  It's the same people that own and operate the big boats that don't know the rules of the water when going in and out of the marinas.   So many times when I had the right of way some jerk pulls in front of me with his big dollar fancy boat.  These people are snooty turds that don't have respect for anyone but themselves.  Let's organize a fishing day in waters by the Coburg Marina !!
916710,chris.brock,2015-05-24 23:29:00,4053,Is that you guys in the video SCL?  Nice urban fishing.
916727,Gallie,2015-05-25 00:27:00,1215,"Good conduct fellas!  And some nice pike to boot, you are the bigger men i wish i could compose myself as you did ?"
916737,kickingfrog,2015-05-25 00:42:00,8333,Just help with the back story. Is this the same place that tried to lay charges last year and lost in court?
916739,Gerritt,2015-05-25 00:45:00,6129,Yup exact same place.
916741,kickingfrog,2015-05-25 00:45:00,8333,Twas.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=64002
916743,206,2015-05-25 00:50:00,563,Ron was supposed to in there Saturday....I haven't heard any out come yet?  Hopefully he see's this and lets us know.
916745,Joeytier,2015-05-25 00:57:00,3990,Love it!  great job
916763,Moosebunk,2015-05-25 02:04:00,3970,"Absolute Bull!  That kind of shart makes ya wanna puke.  Good on the ""talky"" boat guy for keeping his cool through that, I know if it was me, the patience would have lead to ""F"" bombs pretty quick."
916775,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-25 02:39:00,937,That's awesome...I hope they get packed with anglers
916826,fishindevil,2015-05-25 14:57:00,6254,Nice vid  and nice fish !!! Too bad about being harassed by those clowns !!!!
916833,jimmer,2015-05-25 15:24:00,2730,"a good place for a meet and greet. I just shake my head. Good on you guys for going in there and catching some of those pike you aren't allowed to catch. The town of Coburg owns them, didn't you know??? LOL"
916850,jbailey,2015-05-25 16:52:00,866,"nice, i hope the place gets packed.  those pike were hitting hard it looked like to"
916928,Dozer,2015-05-26 01:19:00,896,LOLOL  We're fishin' here because thats where the fish are!  Instant classic
916939,Nipfisher,2015-05-26 01:57:00,2449,Could you ice fish there? North Bay has a by-law stating no fishing in the marina.. Not sure anyone has challenged it?
916945,farsider,2015-05-26 02:22:00,456,"http://www.northumberlandtoday.com/2015/05/21/anglers-asked-to-leave-cobourg-harbour  Ron is doing his best again!  Cheers, Mark"
