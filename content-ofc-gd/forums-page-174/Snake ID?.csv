916912,spincast,2015-05-26 00:48:00,3279,"Found this guy slipping away as I went out to put some stuff in the shed. Very small, less than or about the size around as  a pencil, maybe 8, 10 inches long. Any ideas? Young fox snake? Hognose? the head wasn't a uniform copper, more the same pattern, but the undersides was milky white with black spots? He faked striking when I got the BB up close for a shot. Then I let him slither away.    "
916913,dave524,2015-05-26 00:57:00,4508,Looks like a Milk Snake
916915,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-26 00:59:00,956,Probably a milk snake
916916,Dozer,2015-05-26 01:00:00,896,Yup - I'd say eastern milksnake as well.
916917,spincast,2015-05-26 01:03:00,3279,"yup, based on what I see here, milk snake - thanks guys http://www.longpointlandtrust.ca/pdf/Snakefacts.pdf  LAO - head wasn't a single copper colour, maintained the marking pattern."
916921,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-26 01:06:00,956,Was hoping it was a fox snake cause theres not a whole lot of them around anymore.
916923,Dozer,2015-05-26 01:10:00,896,Neonates can be such a pain to ID - especially within the Pantherophis genus.  Cool find dude - don't see many of 'em around.
916994,craigdritchie,2015-05-26 12:48:00,1586,"Milk snakes are very beneficial, if you have them around you'll never have a mouse problem.  Best to not try handling the adults, since they have teeth like razor blades."
917066,jimmer,2015-05-26 20:04:00,2730,"They like to strike, that's for sure."
917137,Acountdeleted,2015-05-27 01:39:00,2562,They are a species of concern too. Good to see them around.
917138,BillM,2015-05-27 01:46:00,17367,Atlantic?
917146,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-27 02:32:00,8243,Nothing like the Milk snakes we used to see in the Red Hill Valleye in Hamilton as kids. They were huge and probably not even Milk Snakes. They were very light white grey with circles of darker grey. That was 50 years ago.
917173,spincast,2015-05-27 09:11:00,3279,"Atlantic? , yeah. you can tell by the spots."
917186,craigdritchie,2015-05-27 12:14:00,1586,Atlantic?  LOL!!  That never gets old.
