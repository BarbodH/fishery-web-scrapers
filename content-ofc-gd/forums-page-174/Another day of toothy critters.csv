For the first time in 3 trips I had the first hook-up, and the second, casting blue/silver cyclops. Both were the littlest of hammer handles. Ryan had the next one casting a perch minnow bait but again lost it at the side of the boat. Need to work on the bassmasters hook-set.  We then trolled for a bit and my brother finally got into the action and Ryan had to get right in there and supervise.     The second trolled fish was his as well and I was wondering if the bite had switched from the shallower running husky jerks to the deeper diving taildancer that he was running.    Just as I was looking for my box of crankbaits Ryan gets a hit on his husky jerk.   Still working on his hold on the toothy ones.   The husky jerks still produced most of the fish today but the bigger ones did come on the taildancers.  Near the end of the day I was on the outside as we trolled a steep edge so I put on a deep diving dancer. Shortly afterwards I marked a fish 25ft down and right on cue as my bait swam through I had a solid hit. I was hoping it was the mother of all eyes but the fight said otherwise and I had a nice pike to finish the day.    The pike also finished my taildancer unfortunately.   Again Ryan was happy to be bringing home fish but his little sister likes eating it even more than he does.  "

916747,woodenboater,2015-05-25 01:03:00,2277,put it on a plaque and hang it on the wall
916756,Joeytier,2015-05-25 01:39:00,3990,Pike tend to demolish balsa raps...they're hard on the crankbait budget.  Nice fish
916760,Moosebunk,2015-05-25 01:55:00,3970,"Thank Ryan for ""modifying"" the plan.  Quality time for the lads."
916867,kickingfrog,2015-05-25 18:57:00,8333,Pike tend to demolish balsa raps...they're hard on the crankbait budget.  Nice fish  That's my favourite deep walleye crankbait and colour. Need to replace it soon.

917656,kickingfrog,2015-05-30 13:16:00,8333,"No fishing this weekend. P.A. day on Friday may call for an epic fishing adventure (epic for a 6 year old).  Forgot about a little scene that played out while we were casting in a bay. A boat came around the point and the guy was casting the shoreline. Didn't think too much about it because it's a steep shoreline and I'm on the electric and fishing, but after we passed each other my son asks ""Is bass season is open?"" I say ""No"". After a little while he asks me again and says that it looked like the other boat was fishing for bass. As I start saying that the shore is steep and there are lots of ways to blah blah blah my brother says the guy was casting a senko. Instead I explain why some people don't follow the rules. So if you can't fool a 6 year old I'm not sure who you think you're fooling. No word on if he took any photos."
917658,kickingfrog,2015-05-30 13:20:00,8333,nice - you got a lifer there for sure  he gave his life that others might smile  I replaced it this week and only bought 2 extras. Although I just about bought a 16 gauge SxS. I'm ready again for those fish moving deep.
917761,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-31 00:04:00,937,Thank you for sharing
917777,Joeytier,2015-05-31 00:58:00,3990,"Mine too, hehe.  Between these and husky jerks, I'm pretty well set for hardbaits for walleye"
917953,chris.brock,2015-06-01 00:49:00,4053,Good read Rob. The young lad is well on his way.
