917932,Rizzo,2015-05-31 22:54:00,4754,The one at Lighthouse Cove is not the greatest....but if your boat is not too huge it should be ok. I saw them doing work on the Jeannette's creek launch (2 years ago?) so I imagine it is better than L. Cove. Personally I use the LC launch when I plan on fishing the lake and the J. Creek launch if I plan to fish the river
