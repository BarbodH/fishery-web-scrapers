916340,Rodbender,2015-05-22 18:23:00,1027,There North American Badgers and your supposed to report them there on the endangered list  http://www.ontariobadgers.org/

916350,DanD,2015-05-22 19:36:00,2223,"lol - the honey badger... There was one of those nature documentaries on PBS a while back about the honey badger.   I saw that show, it was amazing how smart that animal was/is. Brawn and brains; a true survivor, if we don't end up killing them off?  Dan."
916353,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 19:51:00,11391, Ill let them deal with it. No way am i going near that thing
916773,Moosebunk,2015-05-25 02:34:00,3970,There fighting style is like a big cat plus a bear on crack.  That was funny!  Them badgers be second only to the wolverine for their grit.  You tube some wolverine fights...  Good your dog is OK... would have been a cool site to see.  And hear ya about huskies and wolves too.
916781,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 03:08:00,11391,I went down today and that badger is gone moosebunk.  Maybe she didnt like my dog either??? Lol  I have no idea what there living habits are like but thats a nice den. Surprised she left it. Or maybe they were just off roaming???
916893,Sharkbait22,2015-05-25 23:01:00,297,FYI The American Badger jacksoni subspecies is protected under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). http://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=621
916899,Rod Caster,2015-05-25 23:31:00,5784,"That idiot in the first video is just that. I'm surprised not many comments about the I.Q. challenged imbecilic waste of good carbon and water that basically assaulted a Badger because he want's to become a You Tube star. Once he took the Badger from it's den, where it may have had little Badgers it was protecting, what exactly was duffus going to do with it? Maybe take it to a different "" Fuld""? There has to be a law forbidding stupidity but there unfortunately isn't otherwise he should be charged with premeditated stupidity in the 1st degree. I wish the Badger had have latched on to his organs that are instrumental in procreation. If he didn't have offspring before that the laws of nature would kick in thus not allowing him to have DNA challenged little Badger hunters. Man. If you haven't watched the 1st video don't. It is a waste of 8 minutes of your precious life.   That's quite the rant.  He wanted it off his fields and was protecting his irrigation equipment (or whatever other logical reason he probably had) Hats off to him for not shooting it; legally he probably could-have. I enjoyed that video and my IQ is at least a couple dozen."
916906,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 23:58:00,11391,In other news our badger is long gone.  Water came up 2ft and the den is now submerged.
916910,Rod Caster,2015-05-26 00:20:00,5784,Maybe she left early because she new the flood was coming?
916934,manitoubass2,2015-05-26 01:28:00,11391,Wouldnt doubt it. Very smart these creatures?
916948,Rizzo,2015-05-26 03:13:00,4754,"was waiting for someone to post that ""honey badger don't give a ...."" video. Nearly pissed myself a couple years ago when I first saw it..glad to see its still out there. The narrator is hilarious"
916961,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-26 05:53:00,8243,"Rod Caster,  Yea I can get the blood boiling when I see something that I don't think is right. This guy didn't have any reason to take the Badger away. He is someone trying to garner a You Tube following. He travels around and catches by hand the most dangerous animals and reptiles for the sake of making a video. Such as Rattle Snakes. I have learned a few things about him by following links associated with his You Tube videos. I will not relay some or actually any of the info I read because it is just rumour and I won't spread rumors but will give my opinion of someone that takes wildlife from their habitat"
916997,Rod Caster,2015-05-26 13:01:00,5784,So he's kind-of an American Steve Irwin hahaha
916187,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-21 22:18:00,10439,Badgers are the cute little cousins of this fella. Pic was take @ Dome Lake on the ice road to the diamond mines North of town.

916220,Blue Lk,2015-05-22 01:05:00,337,"Wow,scary stuff,so glad your dog is OK. Years ago my medium sized dog had a run in with a groundhog,he got bit on the shoulder,it didn't break the skin but the bruise covered 1/4 of his body.

916226,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 01:31:00,11391,Wow! Yep i know the area well. All sorts of wild life up that way.  Ear falls/red lake is a gnarly area. From cinnis to wolverine to moose. Gnarly area  Everyday i worked up there i went to me car with 6-8 bears surrounding it.  Friggen nuts
916228,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 01:32:00,11391,And from ear falls to red lake good luck getting to the speed limit. Moose everywhere

916234,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 01:56:00,11391,It wasnt your typical skunk face   Coloured more like a fox

Rick, glad to hear puppy and you are both OK after dealing with one of those guys, they act like a Skunk on speed with a dash of anabolic steroids mixed in, you are both lucky. Your dog kills wolves?"
916254,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 09:06:00,11391,Yep. Every year same old story. Wolves come around in the winter and off she goes.  She takes down one or two every winter. Braydons grandmas dog too. Exact same thing.  Something about huskies and wolves dont mix
916255,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 09:11:00,11391,Yip def not a honey lol  That video is hilarious hahahaha

916274,laughing.my.bass.off,2015-05-22 11:24:00,7,There's a reason there's a breed specially bred to take on badgers (dachsunds)- they are tough summawhatnots!
916337,netminder,2015-05-22 18:13:00,514,"lol - the honey badger... There was one of those nature documentaries on PBS a while back about the honey badger. This guy had one in his nature preserve for some reason - I think someone had it as a pet and realized eventually it wasn't a good idea. Anyway, he eventually had to take everything out of it's open air pen because it would move sticks, logs, rocks etc. to the wall and climb out, destroy the house and harass the other animals (including lions). Even when everything was removed he would roll up balls of mud and then climb out. Not to mention it also figured out how to open the latch on the gate too...  As for the lions, the owner of the sanctuary said the badger would run between the legs of the lion and bite his testicles. However, the second time it didn't end well for the badger. He survived, but barely.  I didn't realize even the badgers in this part of the world were so ferocious. I'll be well served to keep my and my dog's distance."

916118,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 15:28:00,11391,Went for a quick fish down behind the house today and as usual my husky followed.She found a big den and got curious. I put my rod down and tried to call her but in the den she went.It looked vacated but apperently not. I here barking and a bunch of hissing. Oh the smell. So automatically I think family of skunks.After about 30 second my dog comes running out and battle on. A friggen badger!Now my dogs are tough as nails and take out wolves and coyotes every year.But holy crap. All I could do was sit back and watch. That badger whooped my dog all sorts of ways. My friggen dog wouldnt get the point either. This carried on a good 5 minutes before she finally listened and came away yelping.Talk about crazy.I know badgers are nuts but ive never seen it in real life like that.You ever see one get the heck away from it cause itll mess you up.
916124,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-21 15:45:00,956,I have always said if I can come back as one animal it would be the badger.  They got balls.  They would go right into a pride of lions and take there food.  Your dog may never forget the smell of a badger haha.
916127,Gallie,2015-05-21 16:00:00,1215,Your dog was lucky to get away in one piece! Id probably rather deal with a small bear than a badger.
916128,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 16:02:00,11391,There fighting style is like a big cat plus a bear on crack.  My dog has been very humbled
916129,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 16:03:00,11391,At one point my dog had the back of its kneck and the badger was like oh no you didnt!  Those badgers are wicked nasty man  My dog is ok though. I hope she remembers this
916130,NAW,2015-05-21 16:08:00,4022,Glad your dog is still alive!  That's one for the memory bank for sure.
916132,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 16:12:00,11391,Im glad shes alive too!  If i wasnt there they probably woulda fought to the death. And we just lost our old girl husky a few months back
916133,Canuck2fan,2015-05-21 16:15:00,1444,Glad your dog is OK... Badgers are just a ball of muscle with razor sharp teeth and claws. They are bad enough off their territory but I can't imagine one defending it's den. YIKES
916134,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 16:15:00,11391,"And if anyone is wondering, lol  Pretty sure a badgers front teeth are about 2 1/2 inches long of pure nastyness"
916135,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 16:17:00,11391,"Im gonna call mnr see if we can get this trapped and relocated.  Its right down from are yard, where my kids play. Scary"
916137,Beavertail,2015-05-21 16:24:00,331,"COOL story, thanks! Glad all parties involved are ok. They are in the Weasel family, which also includes the Wolverine - enough said! Seriously tough and tenacious dude's...pound for pound I don't think anything comes close to that group of critters."
916138,OhioFisherman,2015-05-21 16:29:00,6623,"There are none in my area, and I am glad!         I have a Boston Terrier, he is big for a Boston, around 30 pounds, and he thinks my land is his land too, very territorial. I don't mind him chasing the bunnies, but it can look a bit scary for him when he corners a groundhog."

916146,manitoubass2,2015-05-21 17:00:00,11391,"I dont even wanna think about a wolverine. Ive seen one in my life way up on the 502 towards dryden while carrying a tinny into a back lake.  Same thing with the smell, almost like a skunk. Thankfully it just carried on and walked past us"

Just keep an eye on it for a few days and make sure it doesn't try to get back in there."
916162,JoshS,2015-05-21 19:32:00,729,"Wow, never knew the badger was so fierce!  ""That badger whooped my dog all sorts of ways. My friggen dog wouldnt get the point either."" Kinda of a funny story tho.. must of been the narrative. Glad your buddy is ok!"

Acting like she let me down lol. Spoil her tonight with some good eats, let her know she did a good job?"
916182,davey buoy,2015-05-21 21:16:00,5505,"Sorry to hear Rick,glad she is ok.They are one fighting till death machine.Watched a documentary a couple weeks back.His big brother the wolverine I did not know they were even nastier. Been known to kill bears and anything in their way.To bad dogs don't know when to back off even if it isn't protecting the family.Instinct I guess.By the way ,from what I heard ,wolverines go right for the neck.A little unnerving to say the least.Hope your dog learned a lesson,for the families sake ."
