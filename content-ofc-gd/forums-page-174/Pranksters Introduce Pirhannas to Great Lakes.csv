I don't imagine that these things could survive the cold water in the winter but still, pretty stupid!  http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/pranksters-arrested-after-introducing-piranhas-to-great-lakes/  Okay, the above link is to a fake news site.  I didn't know that when I posted it."
916309,Headhunter,2015-05-22 15:24:00,5703,I wouldn't worry too much as the Asian Carp will probably get them. HH
916312,G.mech,2015-05-22 16:01:00,830,The World News Daily makes the National Enquirer look legit....that story is on the same page as the FDA approved tranquilizer gun for children and the 40 pound baby born to the 600 pound woman....  It is not reported anywhere else so I'm pretty sure it's a hoax.  They got me too....

Oh and hey guys check out the pike I caught this morning....  bigpike.jpg  :tease:   Those are the small ones that don't make the size limit in that lake......I could tell you boys what lake that is but then I would have to kill ya.....  BTW a few pirhannas might be a good idea to keep people from swimming in areas where it's not allowed.

917015,Mister G,2015-05-26 15:20:00,1429,She should of just ate the chicken as it much better.
