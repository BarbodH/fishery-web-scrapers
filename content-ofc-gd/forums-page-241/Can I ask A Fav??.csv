850889,bushart,2014-04-29 14:57:00,2628,I just spent some time with our web server--cuz I couldn't view our site while using IE---  They had me try via Google chrome--I could get it there  If your using Google or firefox---can you just try it and see if it comes up  It's the Ced-Art banner at top of this site  Thanks
850892,lew,2014-04-29 15:06:00,12766,Works good for me with Chrome
850893,jimmer,2014-04-29 15:08:00,2730,I'm on Firefox and don't see the banner.
850894,bushart,2014-04-29 15:09:00,2628,Thanks Lew  Been a lot of effort and $$ advertising---hate to have problems now  Thanks Again

850898,jedimaster,2014-04-29 15:15:00,3472,Works in all three.  
850899,jimmer,2014-04-29 15:20:00,2730,I see it now.
850901,bushart,2014-04-29 15:31:00,2628,Thanks Guys  So the site comes up on IE when you click the banner??---I'm just getting a white screen still on IE  News is saying Microsoft is having issues with IE and security---not sure if this is it  Funny everything internet wise I'm getting---just our site and CHEZ radio in Ottawa I'm not on IE
850904,jedimaster,2014-04-29 15:38:00,3472,the site and banner loads for me in all three browsers
850905,bushart,2014-04-29 15:49:00,2628,Thanks Jedi
850917,FloatnFly,2014-04-29 16:28:00,1640,"i run an ad blocker, so i don't see any of it"
850934,bushart,2014-04-29 18:20:00,2628,Thanks again all----I just moved into the new millennium and went with chrome and dumped IE
850952,davey buoy,2014-04-29 19:19:00,5505,"I found when I added add blocker my laptop ran far to slow imo.Deleted that,I see it all on firefox.Too eaches own.My youngest son thought that would of been a good idea .I don't have a $1300.00 laptop he does lol.He says it shows to him idk.I,m sure you can get it working."
850996,tender52,2014-04-29 21:19:00,270,good here
851000,SirCranksalot,2014-04-29 21:37:00,3291,I'm on Chrome. I see ads but not yours.
851004,bushart,2014-04-29 21:45:00,2628,Thanks Knuguy---think it rotates when you visit this site--like one time handlebarz lurz---next time fish Ontario---next time us  I'm pretty sure we're still up and running  Thanks again
851006,dracokaos,2014-04-29 21:48:00,116,i'm on a MAC and it works fine
851010,ctered,2014-04-29 22:01:00,40,Worked for me on IE. Nice work by the way.
851019,G.mech,2014-04-29 22:56:00,830,I noticed recently that I cannot even get onto OFC using IE on my new laptop but I can access it fine using Chrome....similar problem with a few other websites too.  Any ideas????
851023,aplumma,2014-04-29 23:09:00,6896,I.E. is not site friendly on many of the boards. The ads are on a rotating basis that rotate on the opening of a page.   Art
851039,bushart,2014-04-30 01:15:00,2628,Thanks again everyone  G Mech---I changed my browser to google chrome
