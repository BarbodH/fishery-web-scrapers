850285,woodenboater,2014-04-26 18:51:00,2277,Praying Glover puts JBJ to sleep or ktfo. Jones lost to Gustafsson and shouldn't even be headlining this one. Also pick Davis
850291,misfish,2014-04-26 19:29:00,29133, X2  Jones loses this one.
850299,Gerritt,2014-04-26 19:53:00,6129,"I am not so sure after reading an article about his training after his last fight,  it made him realize slit of weaknesses I think he has learned a valuable lesson"
850302,Lunatic,2014-04-26 20:02:00,536,"this is a hard one but i think jones wins by GnP,although i want teixeria to win. davis by unanimous decision Boetsch by tko miller by tko halliway by spilt decision  and ill toss in jasmyn duke by sub  (prelim)"
850310,Maverick,2014-04-26 20:13:00,371,"I'm pulling for Glover. I agree with Woodenboater and Misfish, Jones lost to Gus but I also don't think Glover will win tonight. I'm thinking Davis and Boetsch are going to deliver KO's. Should be a decent night of fights."
850319,woodenboater,2014-04-26 20:29:00,2277,I'm still stunned that Browne was destroyed by Werdum lol
850340,Lunatic,2014-04-26 22:17:00,536,"I'm still stunned that Browne was destroyed by Werdum lol Browne suffered a broken hand and nose in the first round,also said to have had a broken rib as well but that could have ended up as a bruised rib.in any case he fought hurt and was gassed."
850398,woodenboater,2014-04-27 02:42:00,2277,HOLY FLYING KNEE BATMAN !!!!!!
850400,Gerritt,2014-04-27 02:49:00,6129,All choked up! Impressive win for Miller. Wins by guillotine choke.
850412,Gerritt,2014-04-27 04:46:00,6129,"I was impressed by Johnson, and jones was vicious with those elbows!"
850437,BassMan11,2014-04-27 13:20:00,583,Fight wasn't even close. Why was there no Jones - Gustavsson rematch right away? Especially after a war like that?
850460,Lunatic,2014-04-27 15:14:00,536,Fight wasn't even close. Why was there no Jones - Gustavsson rematch right away? Especially after a war like that? they do it for a build up. just like hendricks vs lawler
850461,Lunatic,2014-04-27 15:15:00,536,im suprised davis got dominated that bad and couldnt get a take down.
850532,woodenboater,2014-04-27 20:21:00,2277,Loved Benavidez's guillotine and Elliot pounding the matt with his feet since his arms were locked up and couldn't tap.
850554,Lunatic,2014-04-27 21:50:00,536,"Loved Benavidez's guillotine and Elliot pounding the matt with his feet since his arms were locked up and couldn't tap. that looked scary,you could see the panic in his eyes"
