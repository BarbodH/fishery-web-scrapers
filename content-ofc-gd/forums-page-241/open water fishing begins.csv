850468,Terry,2014-04-27 15:38:00,14456,got the boat in simcoe for a test flight  all was well  but it isn't easy with no docks in I made a few casts for perch but didn't see any  come on simcoe trout opener     
850472,BillM,2014-04-27 15:50:00,17367,"Terry, roller or bunks?   What I do is remove the straps/safety chain but leave the hook on the winch attached.  I'll get the oldman to back it down until the rear floats (Even if it doesn't, no big deal).  I'll reach over and remove tension on the winch so it can unwind.  The boat will either move down the trailer unwinding the winch or it will just sit there on the trailer if the water is to low.  I undo the front strap, start the motor and reverse it off if I have to.   I put it on the trailer the same way.  It's extremely fast, no docks required and I'm in and out of the water in zero time.   Give a shot next time (Make Brian do all the work! lol!)"
850479,Terry,2014-04-27 16:10:00,14456,"bunks  I have no trouble when there is a second person, but the test spin was solo  I do hope they put the docks in this week"
850490,manitoubass2,2014-04-27 16:47:00,11391,
850566,irishfield,2014-04-27 22:58:00,26272,Love that matching truck!!  ..doesn't help when Citys/Townships build ramps on too shallow an angle either!
850572,Terry,2014-04-27 23:14:00,14456,most towns  have no idea what is needed to be a good ramp
850575,BillM,2014-04-27 23:19:00,17367,No reason the truck tires should ever have to get wet on a Simcoe launch..  Definitely need a few more degrees in that ramp.
850581,davey buoy,2014-04-27 23:33:00,5505,"Nice looking truck as well as boat.,must of been nice to get on the water with her again!!!"
850589,Terry,2014-04-28 00:26:00,14456,thanks  yup getting on the water makes me feel the nice weather is just around the corner
850620,Moosebunk,2014-04-28 02:46:00,3970,Keep the scratches off them fine new beasts Terry.  Careful out there.
850645,bushart,2014-04-28 11:00:00,2628,When launching on my own...I would have a long line---40ft?  Tied to bow--and then near winch somewhere  Undo everything including winch---back in till she floats off---pull ahead so you can grab rope without getting a soaker  Dun  and yes we still got ice
850646,dave524,2014-04-28 11:14:00,4508,"You need to take a lesson on launching from Billy Bob, come to think of it where has he been as of late, hope he is OK"
850664,Sinker,2014-04-28 13:18:00,8692,"This ^...  Nice to have the boat out. Mine is in for repairs, so really missing it this year!!  S."
850667,Terry,2014-04-28 13:34:00,14456,I did use a long rope the problem was the wind and the very rocky shoreline and cement ramp If I had a remote anchor  or one of those talin pole anchors with a remote it would be real easy to launch by myself.
850723,misfish,2014-04-28 19:58:00,29133," Sorry pal,but I was on a mission. LOL  Nice to see the Lund back in the water again.  Bring on the lakers I say."
850859,Terry,2014-04-29 12:58:00,14456,Lakers will be on the line very soon.
850862,BillM,2014-04-29 13:04:00,17367,Two more weeks!   I hope Gbay is clear of ice for the pike opener.
850867,Terry,2014-04-29 13:17:00,14456,Yeah. Pike walleye. Opens May 1.
850873,BillM,2014-04-29 13:45:00,17367,"Yup, going to need a raincoat from the looks of it."
850932,Terry,2014-04-29 18:16:00,14456,"yeah, hope the wind slows down"
850935,captpierre,2014-04-29 18:25:00,2521,Looks like from the land offshore that it's the Sibbald Point PP launch.  Been a while since I've been there but looks like new concrete.  Used to be permanent docks.  No more?
850939,Terry,2014-04-29 18:28:00,14456,this is the west side of simcoe today     lots of ice and a fish hut too  
850953,misfish,2014-04-29 19:19:00,29133,Thats not a black truck
850961,irishfield,2014-04-29 19:32:00,26272,LOL..
851012,Terry,2014-04-29 22:08:00,14456,lunch break at work in work truck  you got a problem with that....lol
