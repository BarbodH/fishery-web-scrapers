849594,Fish Farmer,2014-04-23 12:12:00,2234,"We managed to find them but it took some work and a little metal. We started the morning off trying to break trail on Smiths bay and got about half way to Orchard Pt. Ended up in 1' of ice and could go any farther so we had to admit defeat. We backed out of Smiths and launched at the narrows. We tried the Simcoe side and nada fish, so we went to Cooch and we found them after we broke trail in a few spots. First 5 mins. nothing then the perch found us. None stop action 1,2,3 at a time. We ended with 135 nice keepers. we must have released at least twice that many small ones. Tuesday we only fish for about 3 hours, rain and cold did us in, so we packed up and headed home. We'll be back Fri.,Sat.,Sun.               "

849683,irishfield,2014-04-23 21:07:00,26272,"Someone will appreciate you breaking the trail Dave!! The prop, that's another thing. How much does that make them perchies per pound..."

850007,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-25 15:20:00,8243,"Like I've said before your nuts Dave, but then again you are a retired Steel Maker from the east end, that explains a lot. We Iron Makers don't pay to get exited we get paid to get exited."
850339,LefroyFisherman,2014-04-26 22:16:00,602,"I was out today, pretty cold wind coming off the ice from cooch, we didn't catch much out there. There must have been only a dozen or so boats out today, pretty sad... The three of us managed about 20 to commit in a couple hours, they all have lock jaw. A lot of guys didn't get much of anything today, Need some warmer weather."
