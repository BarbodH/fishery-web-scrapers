850198,Garry2Rs,2014-04-26 06:28:00,1425,Early next week the dogs and I will be heading for Ontario. We've enjoyed our winter-break and didn't miss the awful weather back home! However we will be glad to get home. I look forward to seeing friends and family soon.  This is the last of my winter project rods. It's an eight foot Musky rod for 3/4 to 3 ounce baits.
