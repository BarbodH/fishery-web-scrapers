I want to make sure it is not during the Goose or Duck opener, so need to find those dates out asap.  Anyone know where or when the seasons are posted for the 2014 season?  One year I was trapped at home with the kids as the sky lit up first thing in the morning.  That sucked, hope to avoid it.  Thanks, Entropy"
