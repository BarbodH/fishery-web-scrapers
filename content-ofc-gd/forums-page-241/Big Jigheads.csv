One of the first things I might look for when the Barrie store opens. I fear though, that like many other things we will not have access to all the good stuff."

That's definitely a good plan Rob if something comes up in the Bargain Cave.   Rollie and Helens musky shop   Didn't see them there Mike.  Have liked dealing with them in the past, as well as the new shop, BigWood Muskie Lures.  They were awesome fast and slightly cheaper... but their stocks aren't quite as good as Rollies yet.   http://www.luremaking.com/catalogue/catalogue-index/catalogue-items/bullet_nose_jig_mold.htm   Meegers... please tell me you're pouring me some right now bud.  That is an OK option... but really, for a trip coming I'd only like about a half doz. chartreuse and another half doz. white in two sizes."

850348,Fang,2014-04-26 23:13:00,1330,Last time I was at JB Fishing Depot I'm sure I saw a few pegs of these. Didn't notice size but they were larger sizes that would be for pike and muskie plastics

850436,mark02,2014-04-27 13:20:00,27,Try Fishing World in Hamilton.  They had the big OWNER jig heads available.  They'd be able to order some for you if they're out of stock. OWNER's website 1 oz. jig = 5/0 hook and 1 1/2 oz. jig  = 7/0 hook.  Ain't cheap at $13 for 3 jigs.
