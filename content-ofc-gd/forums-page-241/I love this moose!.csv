849524,BillM,2014-04-23 01:20:00,17367,Kudos to her for not losing her mind and shooting it...   Everyone went home happy.
849530,manitoubass2,2014-04-23 01:29:00,11391,Bet that got the heart pumping!
849533,Muskieman,2014-04-23 01:31:00,2472,"Seems like a lot of US folk do go sledding with guns , I probably would ... but there's a video out there of a moose getting blown away for doing the same thing"
849535,BillM,2014-04-23 01:34:00,17367,"Seems like a lot of US folk do go sledding with guns , I probably would ... but there's a video out there of a moose getting blown away for doing the same thing  You mean the one where they left it for dead on the side of the trail?   Brutal.   And even in this vid, there seems to be some 'chasing' going on...  What I don't understand is why people just don't stop when they see one?  It was well ahead of them..   Stop, turn the sleds off and wait 10 mins."
849555,knightfisher,2014-04-23 02:22:00,237,Some people just don't have the analytical awareness to realize they are contributing to a situation that could turn bad. There is probably one word to sum up these type of folks. Glad it turned out ok.
849556,Joeytier,2014-04-23 02:23:00,3990,"So easy to judge, but they reacted well once things got sour, and got some great video to boot!"
849559,Dozer,2014-04-23 02:37:00,896,We weren't chasing it but it was running away from us while we drove behind behind it.
849561,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-23 02:40:00,4399,Well they take their sidearms fishing why not sleding!!!! Glad she didn't shoot the moose with that little pop gun might have really pissed mr. Moose off!!!!
849562,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-23 02:45:00,10439,"What the guy said is true. 99% of the time the moose will run a little bit and then turn off the trail and you can drive on by. They weren't chasing it, just going in the same direction. It just happened to be that 1% moose that didn't veer off the trail."

849565,Kerry,2014-04-23 03:03:00,383,Watched an episode of Alaska State Trooper do exactly the same thing.Follow a moose till it jumped off the trail. Kerry

850185,SirCranksalot,2014-04-26 02:57:00,3291,"yep. Here, on some trails, if you stopped and waited for moose you might as well camp out for the night lol. A few hundred kliks might take a week haha They did have a pistol to scare it off with if that happened, but they didn't wait for that 'problem' to arise. They nearly paid a big price for their impatience."
