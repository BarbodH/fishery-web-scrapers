850679,chris.brock,2014-04-28 15:35:00,4053,"I'm not sweating it yet, I just thought some might find this interesting  the teacher's (my wife) have their own private Kijiji like thing, her computer makes a beep when a new item is listed, I swing by to check out this boat/ motor/ trailer on my way to the creek Saturday morning.  The owner said I'm the first guy to come but he's getting swamped with calls and Emails. I was surprised he accepted my $1200 offer (asking $1500, yeah it's a piece of pooh like pretty well everything else I own, Haha), but I wasn't paying any more, and could live without it  I leave $400 deposit, and go to the creek. When he gets gas in it and it runs, I'll give the other $800 and drive away with it.  We planned to chat on the phone Saturday evening. I tried Sat., Sun., and today and can't get a hold of the guy, no answer.  Uh oh, this doesn't look good  see what happens???"
850680,Maverick,2014-04-28 15:42:00,371,"Well, you know where he lives right??"
850681,chris.brock,2014-04-28 15:45:00,4053,yes I do
850682,fisher,2014-04-28 15:55:00,451,do a google search of the phone number and/or name in case that might give you a indication if something is up or not.
850683,Maverick,2014-04-28 16:00:00,371,"Well then, pop by, tell him you were in the neighborhood. If he's not home, park down the street until he comes home. I wouldn't think he's trying to scam you because he wouldn't have invited you to look at the boat at his house. He probably just forgot....hopefully.  He might be new at the whole scam artist thing and hadn't realized that inviting potential victims to your house when you are going to scam them is not the proper way to scam. Let's hope he just forgot though."
850684,BillM,2014-04-28 16:08:00,17367,Could be out of town?  I doubt he's trying to scam you.
850689,chris.brock,2014-04-28 16:28:00,4053,"Could be out of town?  I doubt he's trying to scam you.  we talked about our schedules and he wasn't going out of town,  I'm not nervous yet, he may be having issues getting the outboard going, but I quick phone call would be nice, he may have accepted a higher offer though"
850690,glen,2014-04-28 16:41:00,2641,Do you want to buy another boat?
850693,fisher,2014-04-28 16:50:00,451,Are you sure he lived there?  Did he go inside any of the buildings while you were there?
850694,jimmer,2014-04-28 17:18:00,2730,"Ya, might not be his home or boat. He might have known that the people were away for an extended period of time. I've heard of these types of scams before. I'm sure it will be fine Chris."
850715,Moosebunk,2014-04-28 19:40:00,3970,"Bust his door down Chris and nab your cash back.  j/k  He did give you some sort of deposit receipt no?  Anyways, surely it'll work out."
850722,Sinker,2014-04-28 19:57:00,8692,Im sure its fine.  What do you think you might have bought? LOL  S.
850727,Burtess,2014-04-28 20:28:00,901,I am close to you in Oakville..... if he does flake out (well lets hope not!!) we can amass an army of OFC'rs and will meet you at his place and park outside and not leave till you get the running boat or the cash back lol.....  Burt
850751,BowSlayer101,2014-04-28 21:39:00,296,"always get a receipt when giving a receipt or some sort of verification with the sellers signature so you can sue him if anything, i think you should be fine, if anything pay him a visit and see whats up."
