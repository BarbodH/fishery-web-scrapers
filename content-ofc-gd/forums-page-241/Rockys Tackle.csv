847356,Weeds,2014-04-12 17:29:00,782,"I've heard good things about these guys So I sent in a pair of reels 2 monthes back for service. Now I find I can't get through on the phone, sounds like I'm dialing a fax line after about 10 rings. Anybody visit this store or pass by it that could maybe give me a heads up as to wether its open or not. I'm getting a bit nervous, had hoped to have my reels back by now as one only needed a pawl. Heard all these good things about shimano service lately, this seems like a pretty lengthy turn around time by comparison..."
847359,cheaptackle,2014-04-12 18:04:00,849,If you mean Rocky's in Orillia he was open when I drove by there Thursday.  Unless all the stuff for sale outside the door was free...  Michael
847364,Weeds,2014-04-12 18:39:00,782,"I do mean Rockys in Orillia, yes, thanks. Guess I'll just have to be patient. Perhaps I've just been phoning them while they are away from the phone or something."
847365,Andy,2014-04-12 18:40:00,330,I talked to someone there just last week. I'll send you some info. Andy

847409,Weeds,2014-04-12 22:49:00,782,"Thanks Andy. Cliff, thanks, I'll try an email I've got and we'll see if that works. I may be in touch with you prior to Monday morning."

847683,206,2014-04-14 02:10:00,563,Had a okuma reel defective that was sent there...came back in working order and I don't recall it being to long of a wait.
850116,Weeds,2014-04-25 22:20:00,782,Felt I should update. Spoke to Tyler at the store on Tuesday or Wednesday and received my reels back today(3 days later). They look good and appear to be functioning  well. Overall wait seemed a tad long but I'm still happy.
850204,Big Cliff,2014-04-26 10:55:00,6899,Glad to hear it all worked out for you! Thanks for letting us know.
