850822,Twocoda,2014-04-29 02:30:00,4130,my thoughts exactly ....im thinking it will be a little more potent than a few old salmon on the side of the bank...i wonder if they will explode it with dynamite like they do in the good ole USA
850827,Twocoda,2014-04-29 02:59:00,4130,I cant understand why they dont just pull it back out to sea and detonate it  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/rotting-whale-s-stench-bloating-worry-trout-river-1.2624297?cmp=fbtl
850931,Gerritt,2014-04-29 18:13:00,6129,"I was listening to an official last night on cbc radio... The problem is the whale is beached above the high tide line, it will require an excavator to push the whale off the rocks. It will also require a large ship, the whale is estimated at 180 tonnes, this is a small community that survives on some tourist dollars, they don't have the means or the budget to handle something like this....  Quite the quandary.... Only thing I can think of is federal fisheries or a provincial body to step in and offer funding....  People are climbing this mammal, taking pics etc.. I don't like most people.  G"
