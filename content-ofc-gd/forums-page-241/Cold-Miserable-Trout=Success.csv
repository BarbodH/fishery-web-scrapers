850376,Musky or Specks,2014-04-27 00:44:00,2710,Well I work on Saturdays permantly now in exchange for a shorter work week but I got an in on some private property 15 min from the door at work. My son met me and we were on the creek by 4:20pm.DIdn't take long for my son to catch his first speck of 2014    It was cold and miserable but we still managed to catch 8 fish in an hour before we decide to call it a day. Hope to get out some more before heading to Algonguin for the better part of May. Hope everyone managed to get into some trouts on this long awaited day.
850380,dracokaos,2014-04-27 00:53:00,116,Good job. Anytime you can get out is a bonus!
850396,chris.brock,2014-04-27 02:17:00,4053,"it turned out alright, not a bad way to spend the afternoon, nice!"
850405,BillsTheBassMan,2014-04-27 03:26:00,932,"Congrats Brad.  I grinded for hours and didn't find much.  An Osprey caught a 15"" brown though, was good to see."
850410,Moosebunk,2014-04-27 04:15:00,3970,"Quality time Brad.  Good fishing with the lad.  The sentimental favorite, the speck!"
850434,Rod Caster,2014-04-27 13:06:00,5784,Makes me think I should be trying out my river soon.  Nice first specks of 2014
850447,Musky or Specks,2014-04-27 13:48:00,2710,"I'd wait for a bit. Take water temps, let the water level come down. When the river reaches 58-60 degrees go nuts those specks will be on fire.  I'm thinking of hitting it and the other one up the Hwy June 2 - 6th. Should be prime right about then."
850473,BillsTheBassMan,2014-04-27 15:51:00,932,"I had water temps as low as 39 yesterday,  was a long winter, season will be slower to start."
850485,BillM,2014-04-27 16:27:00,17367,Can't wait to get my small stream trout fix!  Good job especially in those conditions!
