I always try to remember to bring a bag with me when fishing the tribs, even just a smaller grocery bag full taken out each time makes a difference.  It's often like the empty building.... once one window is broken, all the others are very soon to follow.  Some people, if they see garbage strewn about will surely add to it, but if it is a clean and natural area, they may think twice.Lets all do our part tomorrow and bring some extra out with us! This is one from a few years ago.... the fishing was slow so I filled the bag lol....Burt"
850155,trevy727,2014-04-26 00:41:00,351,Nice job. That's a great idea. I won't be on the rivers but I do see the occasional Tim Hortons cup floating in the lake. I always troll by and scoop it up in the net.

A picture here of just the beer bottle and cans along our road, deposited over about the past six months since their last collection.  The girls picked up this bag Good Friday and another Easter Monday.  Proceeds often go to the Cancer Society or other causes.  Drinking responsibly doesn't seem to be in the cards for many folks of Lanark County."
