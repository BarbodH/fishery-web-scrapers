850928,MSBruno,2014-04-29 18:03:00,369,"Looking to spool up my mooching reels this year for lakers .... wondering if anyone is trolling with braid with no flea issue as the Lake Ontario trollers encounter.  Possible or impossible?  Fleas that big of an issue on Simcoe?Can I troll with braid?  I completely understand the other issues with braid, just looking for issues on feasibility, not recommendations.Thanks in advance,Mark"
850937,BillM,2014-04-29 18:27:00,17367,"Sure, but why?  Only thing I run braid on is the dipsy setups..  The riggers get 20lb Trilene Big Game...  A lot cheaper to spool!"
850940,MSBruno,2014-04-29 18:39:00,369,"Being a bass guy, the idea of fighting a fish on a 100 ft rubber band (mono) doesn't tickle my fancy.  Want to see if I can ""feel"" the fight more.  I opted for a medium power, medium/slow action 10'6"" shimano technium rod to cushion the headshakes."

If not you'll be pulling hooks left and right.   Maybe a 10-15ft leader might help a bit."
850946,Fisherman,2014-04-29 18:58:00,7201,"I'd rather rig with a ""100 foot rubber band"" that use braided tractor cable any day.  No finesse involved there at all."
850949,bare foot wader,2014-04-29 19:12:00,1354,"I'm on the same page as you, I use braid for almost everything; downrigging, trolling, mooching back waters, ice fishing, I like the sensitivity, little increased depth and increased spool capacity but I don't have fleas to deal with....I don't use heavy braid, 15-30 for fresh and 50 for salt, depending on the setup  I do top shot a good amount, depends on the situation...trolling for walleye only 10'....salmon or lakers I top shot a good 30-40 yards or so of heavy mono...I use that exact rod you have, I don't lose many fish  downrigging will have issues with the pinch releases, they won't hold, so you'll need to switch to the mechanical styles...aside from that, I don't have any other issues  it's like anything else, just know how to use the tools you have and you're golden"
850950,misfish,2014-04-29 19:15:00,29133,"I know Terry runs braid with a leader (I think)LOL I dont go as heavy as Bill. I run 10 pd  BG. witha 10ft floro lead using12-13.5ft rods Like said,the line is cheap and is good for what were fishing for.Also like Bill said,you will be ripping hooks right out of them with out that stretch.   I understand your getting the fish in fast like a bass,but rigg,n for lakers like that is just not the thing IMO."
850951,bare foot wader,2014-04-29 19:19:00,1354,"you don't have to fight it fast, just keep the drag set appropriately and that med/slow rod bent in half and enjoy every head shake"
850955,MSBruno,2014-04-29 19:21:00,369,"you don't have to fight it fast, just keep the drag set appropriately and that med/slow rod bent in half and enjoy every head shake exactly"
850957,misfish,2014-04-29 19:23:00,29133,"  I dont dought fighting the fish will be a problem. It,s the strike that concerns me.  For me,it,s the strike that will cause the problem with your running straight braid. Theres no cushion . That braid will pull so fast,it will rip the lure. If your running a long tag,I can see it having a bit more give,but if it,s a 10-15 ft tag behind the ball,it,s going to rip fast."
850958,bare foot wader,2014-04-29 19:27:00,1354,"I can't remember what releases I bought, 2 different brands...I'll post tonight when I get home....but they are very adjustable, you can adjust vertical and horizontal tension separately, they are great for downrigging with braid"
850968,Gallie,2014-04-29 19:55:00,1215,"I run braid on everything and will never switch it. When trolling lake o i have no more hit and misses than the next guy. I use scotty pinch clips on the riggers on the strong setting and they never pull out on their own. As for the fleas i havent seen them in simcoe but have only trolled lakers a couple times, only the really bad days on lake o affect my braid with bad fleas so im sticking to it.  Edit. I run 65lb power pro and 50lb seagur flouro leaders on lake o and used 30 lb flouro on simcoe If that makes any difference."
850972,bare foot wader,2014-04-29 20:09:00,1354,"braid is apparently a love-hate thing, but I love it  chamberlain releases, I'll never use Scotty's again, not that Scotty's were that bad, I just really like the chamberlain releases, I can crank my rod down and a tiny shaker will still release  I would imagine the thicker braid holds better for sure, can you pull big flashers without false releases?    http://www.downriggerrelease.com/"
850975,Gallie,2014-04-29 20:14:00,1215,"Yes i can. My deepest rig is always a meat rig with a big paddle, other than dipseys this rig accounts for the highest number of matures every year. I also will pull paddles and flys in other riggers with no issues"
850976,Gallie,2014-04-29 20:15:00,1215,I dont know if i have to mention this or not but i bury the line in the clip all the way on the strong setting every time
850977,BillM,2014-04-29 20:19:00,17367,"I use braid on everything, except my riggers"
850982,Spiel,2014-04-29 20:46:00,9065,"I've got braid on my riggers sticks, no complaints. A little ingenuity helps though....."
850986,misfish,2014-04-29 20:51:00,29133,"I dont mind change,but I,ll stick with what has worked for me very well on Simcoe. I cant complain."
850989,MSBruno,2014-04-29 20:59:00,369,must be softwater season ... many replies and many thanks for everyone's input!
850991,misfish,2014-04-29 21:06:00,29133,Lets us know how you do Bruno.  HAVE A GREAT SEASON.
851038,Gallie,2014-04-30 01:06:00,1215,Maybe you could tell me how to get simcoe lakers in exchange for lake ontario secrets
851044,BillM,2014-04-30 01:55:00,17367,"Maybe you could tell me how to get simcoe lakers in exchange for lake ontario secrets  Simcoe lakers aren't very hard to figure out.. Once the opener hits, I usually jig them... Once a thermocline establishes, it's time to troll (although guys still jig them throughout the summer)"
851050,Gallie,2014-04-30 03:12:00,1215,I usually only fish simcoe for pike but wouldnt mind puttin in some effort in the fall
851087,BillM,2014-04-30 13:05:00,17367,I usually only fish simcoe for pike but wouldnt mind puttin in some effort in the fall  Your best bet is late spring/early summer.
851121,ch312,2014-04-30 14:58:00,1590,"I use braid with a 3-4' leader for everything from jigging for perch to down rigging for salmon with zero problems hooking or landing fish. You won't have any problems with pulling hooks, providing you use a mono or flouro leader, which most use in clear water anyways."
