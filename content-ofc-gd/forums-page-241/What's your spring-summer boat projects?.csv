851024,Moosebunk,2014-04-29 23:12:00,3970,"Some upgrades for The Bomber are, the main sonar is now a Lowrance HDS7 and the Humminbird 587ci is headed to the bow.  Couldn't turn down the HD7 last summer for $500 new and still in the original box, and it's gonna be sweet finally having a bow mount sonar for laker and smallie jigging.  The Powerdrive 55 is soon to be a Terrova 80 with US2 & IPilot too.  Will change that out soon enough, still debating on switching out the 8AWG wire to 6AWG for the run from the batteries.  Also picked up a new custom made cover and couldn't be happier.  Anyone in the Ottawa area wanting a boat cover they should strongly consider LA Barber's Upholstery on March Rd near Carp.  They warrantied their fabric 10 years and stitch work for 6, even though I told them the boat is on the road a tonne and the Lund cover only lasted 3.  With over 25 years working with the Ottawa Marinas they were confident in their product.  The WarCanoe... needs a little paint.  Gunnels soon especially, boat next season.  Some wood rot to be removed in a keel and splash guard, and replaced with fiberglass.  One of the boards in the front seat also has rotted out and I cracked it stepping on that seat last week, so plans to replace it.  Can't seem to let this boat go...    "
850846,RangerGuy,2014-04-29 12:25:00,564,"Seems like even with a new boat there is always something you want add/alter HAHA!  My Spring/Summer list:  - Titan Tiller Assist - Tracked down a unit last fall, couldn't wait to install. So this one is done. What a great addition, can't wait to actually see what it's like to drive with.  - Install the extra seat base I ordered with the boat  - Waterproof strip lights under the gunnel. - I got 2 16' strips of waterproof led lights and a wireless key fob for about $30 Canadian delivered, seems like a really good price. Gonna be great at the dock at night and when setting up in the marsh  - Bob's 4"" jack plate (still have to order this. They have powder coating now, I want to contact them and see if I can order a matching color to the boat  )  - Alter my Avery quick set blind so there is more over head cover to hide the big 18' hole down the middle of the blind.  This will take some thought, so it does not increase how quickly it sets up now.  - Removable Wave Wackers              "

850857,RangerGuy,2014-04-29 12:54:00,564,no worries .... I was nervous ordering from Ebay as well.... So far I've purchased the yamaha outboard diagnostic software and computer connector wire for my outboard from a place in Australia and this wireless controller from China with zero issues. Except that both came faster than most things I've order from the states LOL!

850902,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-29 15:34:00,10439,"I did the bulk of my latest set of upgrades last spring. New 4 stroke OB, Smartcraft gauges, second fuel tank with transfer valve, water separating fuel filter, after market Bimini top, relocated the two TM batteries forward and added a pair of Smart Tabs. This year I'm adding a cast 4"" jack plate for my kicker so it lines up better with my new outboard/Atlas jack plate combo I'm also running new charger cables from my front mounted deep cycle batteries to the 3 bank charger in the rear.  Almost forgot my biggest project this year, build a dock @ my cabin property so I have a place to park my boat when I'm there.  Currently it looks like this (well when the snow goes it does)  "

Sounds like you need to build a casting deck + small platform to mount the motor.  We did something similar on our old Legend.  Worked out great.

Oh.. and I have to try and roll over the 16' steel boat and patch a hole in the hull under the middle seat before I can put it in the lake. Expected it long before this, considering the ""pasta strainer"" I had after sandblasting it in 2005. I'm amazed it has gone 9 full summers in the water when I was told to ""just throw it away"" in '05. Some metal (and I guess rivets with no welder on the island)... some aircraft fuel tank sealer, a hope and a prayer and I'm gonna try and milk another 10 years out of it as it's such a handy boat.  ..and if I don't fix it, Leah will want to drive mine!!

I just bought a standard toggle switch like # 49 from Sayal:  http://www.sayal.com/zinc/zinc_search.asp?txtSEARCH=28SWITCHSAA&title=SWITCH+TOGGLE+THREADED  I also installed the rubber waterproof cover for it:  http://www.sayal.com/zinc/zinc_search.asp?txtSEARCH=28SWITCHSAY&title=SWITCH+TOGGLE+ACCESSORIES  From there I just pulled out the throttle from my console and located the 3 wires that control the tilt. You can't miss them, they have their own harness.  One wire is a ground, the other 2 are up and down.  Unplug the harness, and if the tilt does not work, those are the right wires.  I then spliced into them and ran the added spliced wires to the bow, installed the switch and that was it."
850979,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-29 20:32:00,184,Thanks! I'm going to give it a shot. Handy to have if your in the front of the boat casting and you come up shallow.
