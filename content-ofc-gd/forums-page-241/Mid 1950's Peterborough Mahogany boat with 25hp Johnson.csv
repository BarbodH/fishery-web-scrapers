850239,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 14:09:00,1814,"Hey guys and gals.  This is my Dad's boat, and has not seen water for at least 15 years. He does not have the time or interest in restoring her. It definitely needs a lot of work, and I know very little about mahogany boats - but there are some bad spots in the wood for sure as the pictures will show. I have no idea if these can even be repaired - maybe some of the experts on the site can help me out here! From what I know, the boat is from 1958 - that is the date stamped on some of the cleats. Also from memory, I think the 25hp Johnson is a 1954 or 1955 - the serial number can be seen in a few of the pics so maybe someone can help me figure that out. This boat was an absolute blast when she was running - and pretty fast too. Again, I have no idea what state the motor is in - but I do know the last year we had the boat in the water she was running. For sure needs a tuneup. There are a couple of the original metal fuel tanks available as well, and the red vinyl bench seats from the boat are stored in my parents basement - in good shape. I can not make any claims to the road worthiness of the trailer either, it has sat in the same spot for years as well.  So, all that being said - the boat is available, free to anyone who wants to take on the project. You just have to pick it up (Toronto, Beaches area) - most likely with your own trailer and a few guys to help lift the boat onto it. The motor, which includes the metal stand, fuel tanks as well as all the controls in the boat is available for $100. It is an electric start by the way. If the boat is a write-off, I will remove all the motor rigging from the boat to include in the sale.  Here's some pictures of Naomi - that was her name                                        "
850244,lew,2014-04-26 14:23:00,12766,"Very similar to the boat & motor I learned to fish & water ski from in the 50's Pete, brings back some good memories. Ours was a pull start 25HP Sea Horse and I can still see my dad pull starting that big old beast.  Funny thing though, back then a 25 was considered a big motor and we could just about outrun anybody."
850246,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 14:31:00,1814,We water skied behind her with no problems too... I think she did close to 28mph!
850251,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-26 14:52:00,4399,Nice rig...I used to run around Rice lake in one just like it many many years ago.  Hopefully somebody will take on the project she`d be beautiful when restored!!!
850254,Dave Bailey,2014-04-26 15:18:00,1641,"If you would like to see it properly restored you might want to donate it to someplace like the Muskoka Marine Museum. They can issue you a tax receipt, they'll probably pick it up themselves, and you won't have to worry that it will be snapped up by someone who initially has grand ideas, but who then lets it rot in a backyard. http://mmm.vianet.ca/"
850275,Bernie,2014-04-26 17:25:00,3190,I'd like to have the motor and controls.But the boat would take more work than it's value.  The engine is a 1955.
850276,misfish,2014-04-26 17:34:00,29133,"I'd like to have the motor and controls. But the boat would take more work than it's value.  The engine is a 1955.  If Pete lets the motor and controls go Bernie,I can bring it up for ya.  VIA Misfish express.LOL"
850277,irishfield,2014-04-26 17:58:00,26272,Or you could bring it to me Brian and Leah can drop it in May when we head for the lake. Bernie would probably rather see her... just sayin...
850278,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 18:09:00,1814,"Dave - that's a great idea, thanks for the link. I will send them an email today. I'm sure my dad would love to see her properly restored to her former glory!  Bernie - I would be happy to sell the motor and controls on their own, if we can make arrangements via the Brian or Wayne express for delivery that would be perfect. Let me know!  Thanks Pete"
850281,Bernie,2014-04-26 18:29:00,3190,"I'd hate to impose on anyone for delivery. But is it isn't too much of a problem for you fellas, that would be great  Pete, I don't need the steering stuff. But all the electrical with the face plate for start/stop would be great. I'll PM you for payment.  Thank you!"
850288,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 19:01:00,1814,"Sounds good Bernie! Brian and Wayne - either of you heading to Whitby or the GTA any time soon? I am working near Parklawn/Lakeshore, could make a run up the 400 and meet at BPS or somewhere in that area."
850290,misfish,2014-04-26 19:25:00,29133,I can met ya at BPS  Next week. Will pm ya a day. Then head up to Waynes to see Leah for a while.  Wayne
850292,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 19:31:00,1814,LMAO Brian!!! Never mess with a man who sticks TIG sticks into his brain... just for fun!!!  Tuesday is the only day that won't work for me.
850356,irishfield,2014-04-26 23:42:00,26272,Ok Brian.. just let me know when you're coming up to be sure I'm here..  ...and you've got that right Pete! lol
850357,Bernie,2014-04-26 23:44:00,3190,Thank you very much fellas!Much appreciated.
850394,John Bacon,2014-04-27 01:47:00,3277,I think my dad had the exact same motor on his old wood boat.
850395,dhickey,2014-04-27 02:10:00,1038,I will take all of it motor controls boat and trailer. I am a cabinetmaker/finish carpenter  looking for a boat like this.  I learned to fish in a boat like that. My Father sold it when I was in Alberta I could have killed him.grrrr  I would even go one step further and post the restoration on OFC.  Don.
850712,Fisherpete,2014-04-28 19:24:00,1814,"Hi Don - Bernie has bought the engine and controls but you are welcome to have the boat and trailer - I have not heard back from the museum, so let me know.  Thanks Pete"
850716,fishnsled,2014-04-28 19:42:00,3520,"Just to throw another option out there, I could also bring the motor up is a few weeks for ya Bernie.  I'm in Oshawa Pete so whatever works best for everyone involved."
850720,vance,2014-04-28 19:55:00,719,"Here's another option,I live in oshawa and heading up mattawa for the summer on the 9th of may,and I have to stop in powassan just a block over from bernie's shop.shouldn't be a problem to drop it off..  vance"
850724,misfish,2014-04-28 20:07:00,29133,"Pete,Wil and Wayne,check pm,s."
