850614,BowSlayer101,2014-04-28 02:09:00,296,"had a great opener, got out two days in a row, not a ton if fish but probably my best opener for numbers, they were very willing to hit after begin caught several times. Got my bud on his first so that was a nice bonus! Lots of ripped leaders and pi$$y periods but it was all good and worth it in the end, got some bruisers and got some that were fresh as if they were fall run fish. here are some pics:[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url[/url"
850616,Tim Mills,2014-04-28 02:20:00,476,Nicely done. Glad you and your buddy did well.  Was it crowded? See any CO s?
850625,BowSlayer101,2014-04-28 02:59:00,296,"Thank you! One spot was very crowded the other not a person, i saw 2 co's one checked us on saturday, my dad was digging around for his license in saturday and the co saw his trapping and firearms license sticking out and said thats enough for him to see that were not gonna be breaking any laws, haha. Today one just drove by and didn't check, lots of fish around, not quite as many as previous years but they certainly are hitting well!"
850634,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-28 05:50:00,8243,Nice way to start the year. How many times can you take a pic of the same fish? This where I'm supposed to insert a winking face thing.
850636,Moosebunk,2014-04-28 05:55:00,3970,Great fishing lad.  Good opener for you.
850642,wormdunker,2014-04-28 07:05:00,1711,Nice pix!  Thanx for posting!  Where did you purchase your waders?  I haven't seen any with the lace up boots.   But then again I haven't been looking too hard??
850648,BillM,2014-04-28 11:24:00,17367, 
850669,BowSlayer101,2014-04-28 13:47:00,296,"Thanks guys, i got the waders at bass pro for 100 bucks, they were the only ones i saw that had the boots sewed on to the waders and were lace up and the reviews weren't half bad either! I don't have any complaints so far, I've owned them from last opener and they've held well, i got them online."
850670,BowSlayer101,2014-04-28 13:48:00,296,Nice way to start the year. How many times can you take a pic of the same fish? This where I'm supposed to insert a winking face thing. they were all different fish though?? The last two look the same but are different fish.
850674,misfish,2014-04-28 14:18:00,29133,Oh I wonder what Mr. Imperial had to say? LOL  Nice outing.
850675,BillM,2014-04-28 14:31:00,17367,"Oh I wonder what Mr. Imperial had to say? LOL  Nice outing.  Nothing, I had never seen lace up stocking foot waders before I assumed they were boot foots, that's why I edited my post"
850840,wormdunker,2014-04-29 11:55:00,1711,Thanx for the reply about the waders.  $100.00 sounds good.  I was looking at other brands $250.00.  I like your price & the lace up boots.
850861,The Urban Fisherman,2014-04-29 13:04:00,2050,good stuff man - I don't have  the patience for all those snags...   You're a better man then me!
850865,Mike Pike,2014-04-29 13:12:00,1332,"That's a dang good day of fishin Bowslayer.  Thanks for posting your pics.  Hey, I'm confused by that one fish that looks like a bowfin( dogfish )but has the mouth of a sucker.  Do you know what that is?"

850868,Mike Pike,2014-04-29 13:19:00,1332," That's definitely a sucker. Yup, totally a sucker.  I see it now.  What had me confused was that I didn't see the tale partially submerged so it looked like a bowfin body.  See it?  Anyhoo, it's time for new glasses.  lol"
850877,BowSlayer101,2014-04-29 13:52:00,296,thanks for the kind words guys! Yes that fish is one of the many small suckers that were annoying as heck!
