Not one launch (free) is open.  Someone is going to be pocketing alot of cash. Unless they have a heart and charge say 10 bucks max. Dought thats going to happen.  South of the narrows is open a lot. Sorta.     I use to use spot to launch my tinny. Nope    Free launch just before the narrows.  Solid    Free launch at Orrila park by the legion. Solid    Looking out from the launch,and this view is the same all the way up to Wab.    On a side note.  ST.John is still foze over as well at is launch  "

848858,misfish,2014-04-19 18:27:00,29133,Rob. I didnt see a single boat or angler anywhere this morning. It does start today right??????????????
848860,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 18:40:00,8333,"Yep. Starts today. Tough one for participants, sponsors and organizers."
848861,misfish,2014-04-19 19:03:00,29133,I even stopped by the motel to see if me newfie brudder was up from Steel Town.. NOPE.
848863,misfish,2014-04-19 19:22:00,29133,"I wonder how many tags got eaten this morning? They are thick every where I was today. And I have been as far as Wab,all the way down to the canel rd this morning. You have got to see the number of those dirty birds along the canel. AMAZING.  "
848865,Terry,2014-04-19 19:29:00,14456,all of them
848916,Fish Farmer,2014-04-20 00:30:00,2234,"Thanks for your report Bro. Looks like the first picture launch is doable. We'll be there Monday for 2 days and back Fri,Sat.,Sun. Those dam birds ate my tag. Gezz that doesn't look good. Nobody fishing the first day, that has to be the first. I can remember when you could walk across the boats out there. I hope things pick up for all the hard work the organizers do."
849050,Scott S,2014-04-20 21:13:00,203,Stopped buy the narrows this afternoon. Didn't see anyone catching anything. A few boats out by the ice. There was 4 perch in the tank at the headquarters from all day! Scooter
850518,kickingfrog,2014-04-27 18:45:00,8333,"Not surprisingly, not many perch have been caught.  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2014/04/26/first-tagged-perch-yet-to-come-in-at-orillia-perch-festival"
850560,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-27 22:22:00,8243,"Fish Farmer, a frozen lake has never stopped you from launching your boat. Are you putting the auger in the boat?"
