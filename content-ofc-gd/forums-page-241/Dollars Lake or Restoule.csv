850235,Fishingmedic10,2014-04-26 13:44:00,5,"Thanks for the heads up, can easily postpone a few weeks. Had'nt even  checked the reg's, just in the planning stage. 6 guys 3 boats, looking for some camp sites now. Mike"

The CO's do and they will be more then happy to remind you of them and slap you with a hefty fine so that you remember as well.  Welcome to the board. Some friends of mine and I are heading to Restoule in August. I've heard a lot of good things."
