828125,slightlyhuman,2014-01-02 18:28:00,29,"thanks Bill, yea from what I've heard without snow shoes I'm going to have a bad time walking out haha. here's to hoping a sled blazed a trial for me (i've heard of sledders out on lake joe already)"

828470,discophish,2014-01-04 17:29:00,392,"We drove up north on the eve through whiteout snow squalls.  It snowed about 10 inches, if not more during the 24hr period on the 31st/1st, in addition to the 2.5 feet of snow already on the ground.  There was so much slush and snow on the lakes that walking was borderline impossible.  After each minute that passed, we had to dump the gear out of the sleds, turn them over, and chip at the slush and ice.  It was -25 so the bottom froze instantly even after a few seconds of plowing through.  It won't be like this everywhere in that area, but this was our experience.  We weren't at the place you mentioned.  It has been a few days since the opener, so I would assume that the foot paths are nicely groomed by now, depending on where you go of course.  Our holes were 7"" of clear ice.  Good luck!"

828883,Broker,2014-01-06 22:32:00,482,"Walked out onto the lake on the 3rd, was a good 6 inches in the spot I was on."
828978,BillM,2014-01-07 14:37:00,17367,How was the slush/snow situation?  Did they get blasted like we did down here?   I'd love to get up for some laker action before Joe opens.
829054,Broker,2014-01-07 18:37:00,482,"There was maybe 2-4 inches on snow on the ice id say, and only saw one slushy spot, the rest was hard ice."
829055,BillM,2014-01-07 18:37:00,17367,"Right on man, appreciate the update."
835232,Dan668,2014-02-08 02:30:00,1120,"Just bumping, how's the conditions? Deciding between simcoe or here, possibly haliburton. Ahhh to many lakes!"
835246,Pikeslayer,2014-02-08 03:20:00,1443,"Was up on a smaller lake 30 minutes SW of Rosseau last weekend. 2-3 ft of heavy snow, 6 in of slush & 30 in of ice. Hard walk & tough pull even with snowshoes. ATV not an option."
835256,Dan668,2014-02-08 04:12:00,1120,Thanks! Makes my decision a bit easier

835277,BillM,2014-02-08 13:22:00,17367,"30"" eh?  If your auger sucks, the ice gets thicker and thicker with every turn"
835278,Pikeslayer,2014-02-08 13:26:00,1443,For sure.
835294,Pikeslayer,2014-02-08 15:53:00,1443,My auger works just fine  
835295,jbailey,2014-02-08 15:54:00,866,"damn, that's crazy"
835304,BillM,2014-02-08 16:44:00,17367,I need an auger I can use out on the ice roads to!  LOL!!!!
