The lodge I was going to book does not have an opening so I am left to try and find a place.  I have read every post on here dating back a few years about Lodges and now I have a headache! I have fished in Quebec, Eastern Ontario, and Western Ontario over the last 15 years.  I have had some nightmarish experiences and want to try and avoid that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Mike"

834649,mj2112,2014-02-05 16:14:00,46,"I am traveling with 2 people, drive in or boat in, June 21 through July 5 (any days in between those dates) Smallmouth, Northern, Walleye, Musky would be great if they all swam near the cabin. I have flown to Toronto, then Thunder Bay, rent a car and drive North in the past."

834751,mccwell,2014-02-06 00:25:00,7,I have been real happy with lodges in around the Dryden and Atikokan area. Browns Clear Water has several out post camps and boat rental options. June has been some of the best fishing so you my need to get going on reservations soon. Good luck.
