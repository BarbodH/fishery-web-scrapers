834458,scugpg,2014-02-04 16:27:00,1373,I'm looking for some options/opinions on putting a bimini top on a 16ft tiller. I've heard they can be more challenging to deal with as you are at the back where it usually is mounted. My boat would typically be trailered around so fixed mount likely isn't an option. If you have and suggestions or experiences with this setup please let me know.  Thanks

834466,fish_fishburn,2014-02-04 17:03:00,1311,Have a look at www.anp.ca they will give you an idea.
834470,Fisherman,2014-02-04 17:24:00,7201,Pretty decent prices by the looks of it.
834488,scugpg,2014-02-04 19:43:00,1373,yes that site looks interesting.  anyone have experience buying from them? or anyone run a tiller with a bimini?
834510,fish_fishburn,2014-02-04 21:25:00,1311,My buddy bought one for his 15' tiller. He just gave the measurements and had it in a couple weeks. Its well made and should last a long time. He bought the stainless hardware package.
834520,SmokestackLightnin,2014-02-04 22:32:00,390,OK it's not a tiller but I love my bimini.  Pontoon boat has one as well.

834636,Hoppy,2014-02-05 14:22:00,95,I bought one from anp last year. They were fast and easy to deal with. Tons of options to choose from. Well built and good looking too.
834712,Steve,2014-02-05 22:16:00,2075,bimini on a tiller?  blasphemy!
834728,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-05 23:15:00,10439,I put one from Cabelas on my 18' side console last year. I used sliding tracks so I could place it where I wanted it when deployed or stowed. I don't see why it wouldn't work with a tiller.
834755,Fisherman,2014-02-06 00:46:00,7201,"I can see it being a bit of a hassle if you're downrigging, kinda hard to dance around with the top up. So far i've held off with a bimini, I use a big old golf umbrella on those hot blistering days and it provides a spot to hunker under when the sky decides you need a wash."
834773,Lukasaurus,2014-02-06 01:30:00,19,"I have a 16' tiller with a Bimini. I got it so my my wife could get out of the sun. I installed it above her seat, the top is only 6 feet long so it does not cover me at the back. I find it a pain to fish around. It was very easy to install, easy to take off and back on. I only use it when my wife is in the boat. It's worth every penny, happy wife, happy life. I ordered mine from the place below, the price is good and only $9 shipping.    http://www.kapscomoto.com/SearchResults.asp?Extensive_Search=Y&Search=bimini&Submit.x=22&Submit.y=17"

You wouldn't have the bimini covering the entire boat.  Front half and back half are left open."
834873,Governator,2014-02-06 16:53:00,879,For some reason I read this as bikini tops on a boat... sigh.  Carry on.
