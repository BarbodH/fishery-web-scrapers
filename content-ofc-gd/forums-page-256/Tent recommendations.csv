833992,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-02 00:23:00,540,"Hi all, sold my trailer and looking to buy some camping gear and am hoping for some recommendations on a tent.  I have 3 small boys, so ease of set-up and space is a must.  We will be doing drive-to camping, so not concerned about weight.  Thanks in advance"
833995,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-02 00:46:00,10439,"I'm a big fan of Eureka tents. I have one of their 4 season tents but their 3 season tents are quality also. Eureka's customer service is awesome also. When my tent was 5 or 6 years old my main hoop pole broke. I called Eureka and they said no problem, mail it to us and we'll take care of it. It only cost me postage to them and it was fixed like new."
833996,SirCranksalot,2014-02-02 00:48:00,3291,Check out the MEC website and the Eureka site and you'll see a whole variety of good quality tents.
834005,Musky or Specks,2014-02-02 01:28:00,2710,Four Hammocks You'll never regret it.  http://www.mosquitohammock.com/  There is a two person one made now as well  
834014,cram,2014-02-02 02:20:00,1733,"+1 on Eureka. LeBarons has a pretty good selection.  Sail as well (though LeBaron is priced better, I believe)"
834036,Pigeontroller,2014-02-02 03:56:00,2793,Did anyone mention Eureka?
834040,Woodsman,2014-02-02 04:05:00,1286,Don't even consider an Escort. BTDT
834046,mcdougy,2014-02-02 04:57:00,274,"For ""Glamping"". We have used the large tent sold at Costco. Granted I can not recall going through a storm in it yet. (4 years) We set up a BYOBed and its pretty close to a hotel room. Jr. ends up on the floor with  the dog.   It would have room for a couple little fellas on the floor as well as the bed.  I don't recall the price but remember it did not break the bank by anymeans. Plus there return poicy is a plus if you don't like it.  Costco actually has some decent camping gear on occasion.  For our backpacking canoe trips we use a McKinley and a eureka tent. Lighter weight and have definetly gone through a few storms so I can attest to there waterproofness."
834056,fishing n autograph,2014-02-02 10:25:00,2540,Last year I bought a Coleman tent from Costco and it held up fine in some down pours in algonquin. It's an 8 man tent and it's snug having 4 ppl and 2 double air matresses in them.
834067,Tim Mills,2014-02-02 13:15:00,476,"U can check prices on line at tent city and Sierra trading post, outdoor adventure show is also coming soon and there may be some good deals there"
834071,lew,2014-02-02 13:26:00,12766,I've had alot of tents over the years and the best ever was Eureka.
834245,T-Bone,2014-02-03 15:19:00,160,"I spent the better part of late-summer and autumn looking at and researching tents. I ended-up getting a Mountainsmith Morrison 3 (but will be used by only 2-persons). Not the least-expensive in the class, but had glowing reviews, great standard feature set and really couldn't get much easier set-up and tear-down. For a group of four, Mountainsmith has a model called the Conifer 5+. Most tents that the manufacturer says are for ""three"" are really perfect for two, and so on. I did give a good, long look at Eureka tents and have nothing but good things to say about what I found when doing my research...just didn't go that route. Both Eureka and Mountainsmith are considered 'lightweight' or 'backpacking' tents, but they're sturdy. If money isn't an object, you can't get any better than Hilleberg.  Here's a link to MS site. Good luck.  www.mountainsmith.com"
834256,SirCranksalot,2014-02-03 16:16:00,3291,"Apart from size and quality, you need to think about the features you want. e.g. I find that 2 doors with a small vestibule outside eah to be a very desirable feature. Little mesh pockets inside are also very convenient. OTOH, I don't care at all for 'mesh lofts' for putting damp clothes overhead."
834263,Cast-Away,2014-02-03 17:35:00,790,I 3rd the Costco tent. Mine just gave up the ghost last year after 5 or 6 years and only cost me $120. It slept 6 people.
834268,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-03 18:22:00,540,Thanks for all the advice...thinking Eureka Northen Canyon
834659,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-05 17:09:00,540,Thanks everyone!  Hit LeBarons yesterday and picked up a Eureka
834765,mcdougy,2014-02-06 01:07:00,274,i hope you didnt pay tax Pete
834781,SirCranksalot,2014-02-06 01:51:00,3291,"Eureka, he's found it!!"
834787,4x4bassin,2014-02-06 02:08:00,1025,So what tent did you choose out of the Eureka line up ? I might be getting a new one in the spring.
834853,mattybculp,2014-02-06 14:26:00,388,"So I have a bunch of tents ranging from a 2 man up to a chalet style. For various types of camping. Every year the wife and I go camping for a week, its not a drive in site, I gotta hump our gear in about 500 yds I think the tent weighs maybe 25 pounds but I takes us less than 25 min to set up and its so spacious that I can put a double queen air mattress at one end and have approx. 2 1/2 feet on either side and then at least another 5-6 feet at the end. Tons of room. It comes with an indoor LED light and fan which are a nice little touch. We always tarp off our tent off, but we were in some torrential down pours this summer, to the point of having 6 inches of standing water around it and it held up just fine. Had to order it over the phone through BPS cause they don't carry them in Canada, but its high ceilings mean I never have to bend over when walking around in the tent it must have close to a 7 ft ceiling. I have a couple Eurekas they are great but this is a great family cabin tent. Oh the tent is called the coleman prairie breeze"
834859,mattybculp,2014-02-06 14:38:00,388,Disregard ^^^^^^^^^. I guess it helps if I read all the posts !
834878,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-06 17:14:00,540,Got the Northern Canyon
834880,lew,2014-02-06 17:20:00,12766,"Got the Northern Canyon  That's a nice tent, should make for alot of good trips for a long time."
834888,cram,2014-02-06 18:15:00,1733,Great choice.  We picked up one of those as well.   Perfect for car camping.
