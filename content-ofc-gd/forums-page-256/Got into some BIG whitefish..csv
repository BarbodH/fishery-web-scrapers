Weather felt like summer….a balmy -20C, but no wind. Got chillier later when a 10kmh wind whipped up from the SWest.  35' to 40' FOW.  1.5"" white/pearl YUM LPT tubes on 1/8th Oz jigs.  Fish were finicky but every now and then an unstoppable freight train would smash the mini tube. When you saw it coming you had to hold the bait still or it would pull out of the attack and head back to the bottom, they did not want to chase at all today.  No trout today, but we'll be back for sure.  I ended up with 8 on the ice,  about the same got off. Just what the doctor ordered after such a long time off the ice.   (best when HD is selected)        "
