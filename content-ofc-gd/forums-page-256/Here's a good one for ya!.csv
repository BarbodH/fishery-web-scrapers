I yell at Scott (cause he was colsest to it) he sets the hook and reel's it in like he wanted to set the line on fire......a small pike. Maybe ft long, comes out through the hole like a rocket..... He drops everything..... pole and fish on the ice.... RUNS about 10 ft away....stops, turns and yells holy crap!!!! (i know the whole lake heard us) Probably the biggest fish he ever caught. No pic cause i was laughing so hard, and he wouldnt touch it.  Just had to share."
