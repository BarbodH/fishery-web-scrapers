835129,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-07 18:59:00,932,Hey all.  I figure there are a few folks around here with this topic.  Our group has rented a cottage for a week in August near oak island on the nipissing west arm.  We have one boat but by no means is it a fishing boat (as the person who owns it is scared of toothy critters and having fun).  We are in need of a full week boat rental from someone that is willing to let us dock it at the rental cottage for the week we have it rented.  I have researched numerous lodges in the area and am wondering if anyone has recommendations for a small cedarstrip or aluminum rental for the week.  Any insight is appreciated.  Thanks Ryan

835156,aplumma,2014-02-07 21:20:00,6896,I second Lak Air not only is there boats and engines top notch but they will happily draw a basic map on areas to watch for and I am almost sure they have insurance policies you can purchase if that weighs on your mind.   Art
835305,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-08 16:45:00,932,"Insurance policy is definitely a plus if available.  Has anyone used the boats from Memsquit with the fish finders?  Can I get away with the Navionics app and a chart map for charting?  I would prefer to give my business to Lakair due to the overwhelming support on these boards, but I also want to ensure that I have all angles covered.  Ryan"

I'm sure he'll rent you one if he has any available, usually ppl that stay there have priority on them. We did rent a boat once and camped on an island. West Bay is a nice place. Good luck!"
835307,lew,2014-02-08 17:00:00,12766,Can I get away with the Navionics app and a chart map for charting?  I use Navionics Hotmaps for the West Arm but they don't chart anything west of Hwy 64. Don't know if there's anything else available as of now though.  You can get a good detailed map  from the lodge.
