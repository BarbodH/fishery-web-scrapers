835071,chong,2014-02-07 13:13:00,102,Anyone using this braid? Think about getting 30lbs for my baitcast.  
835085,adempsey,2014-02-07 14:31:00,1498,"Not currently, but I would.   Plan on trying when I respool.  Has received good reviews based on my searching."
835093,Dan668,2014-02-07 15:12:00,1120,It's a good braid. Just don't go to small. As the line is thinner. What techniques you planning on covering with that reel?
835094,NANUK,2014-02-07 15:21:00,797,"I have been using it for a few years now, very good line, strong, supple and thin, excellent for casting."
835096,BillM,2014-02-07 15:28:00,17367,"I wonder how some of the expensive Japanese braids stack up against everyday PowerPro...   I don't mind spending $$$ on line, but there's gotta be a definite difference between the two, lol."

835104,bassjnkie,2014-02-07 15:58:00,1101,"Been using it for a long time now... Casts like a dream, very strong and diameter is very thin.."
835110,aero_ball,2014-02-07 16:43:00,19,"Have been using 55lb for the past few years for pitching and flipping. Pretty soft and strong, and it doesn't discolor (I use green) or fray as quickly as Power Pro from my experience.  On the other hand because of the softness of the line I've experienced a little more wind knots when casting.  I've never used any lighter pound test for long casting though so I can't comment on that."
835118,Dan668,2014-02-07 17:31:00,1120,30lb should suit your needs. I had 20lb on a casting setup before but had breakage problems. Could of just been a bad spool.
835119,Dan668,2014-02-07 17:32:00,1120,I've used Sunline sx1 and fx. Like them both better than PP. Can usually score a deal when they run b1g1 promotions. Haven't tried the more expensive stuff because I use fluoro on most setups.
835141,musky_hunter,2014-02-07 19:54:00,328,like the braid but bleeds way too much.  much prefer SX1 and FX2.
835149,chong,2014-02-07 21:00:00,102,like the braid but bleeds way too much.  much prefer SX1 and FX2. We don't have sunline in quebec
835151,BillM,2014-02-07 21:08:00,17367,We don't have sunline in quebec  You can order it from pretty much anywhere.
835167,chong,2014-02-07 21:52:00,102," You can order it from pretty much anywhere.  Yes i could,but it will cost more. Daiwa in 30lbs is 23$ at Lebaron."
835279,BillM,2014-02-08 13:40:00,17367," Yes i could,but it will cost more. Daiwa in 30lbs is 23$ at Lebaron.  You gotta pay to play."
835314,chong,2014-02-08 18:57:00,102, You gotta pay to play. yes.but i'm not going to break the bank to play.
835386,BillM,2014-02-09 03:53:00,17367,yes.but i'm not going to break the bank to play.  How much more are we talking about?  $5-$10?   Lots of retailers will even ship up here for nothing.
835389,chong,2014-02-09 05:38:00,102, How much more are we talking about?  $5-$10?   Lots of retailers will even ship up here for nothing.  The sites i've checked shipping is between $15-$30 usd.
835404,EC1,2014-02-09 15:11:00,930,"I would never go lighter than 55 for samurai. I'm able to snap 40 on a snag pretty easy with just my hands. I can see 30 being worse. It is good stuff, but since its so thin you need to check for fraying often"
835406,hirk,2014-02-09 15:37:00,571,"I tried 30lb 5yrs ago and it stayed on my reel 1 day, broke off like nothing even with my drag backed off."
835411,Angler management,2014-02-09 17:29:00,280,"X2! The spool survived less then 50 casts before i tore it off out of anger. Made a promise to myself not to cheat on my PP last year, as shes always been so good to me. But it always seems like whenever i buy a new reel, i want to try a new kind of line on it... Wasted a lot of $$$ that way!"
835448,manitoubass2,2014-02-09 22:32:00,11391,"Wow 30lb test broken by hand??? Sounds like a dream line lol. Ill be staying far away from this brand, thanks for the heads up!  Frig if i tried that with 15lb pp or 832 it would cut my hands off before the line broke lol"
835453,chong,2014-02-09 23:16:00,102,"Wow, I guess i'll stick with PP."
835455,davey buoy,2014-02-09 23:25:00,5505,"Wow, I guess i'll stick with PP. In Moss Green lol,4 of my reels use it,a couple are going on 3 seasons and no issues.If it ain't broke,don't fix it.Liked hearing the feedback of the line though."
