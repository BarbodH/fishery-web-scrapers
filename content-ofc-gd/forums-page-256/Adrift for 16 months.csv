834515,Roy,2014-02-04 22:10:00,13728,He probably had told his wife that he was going out for a loaf of bread and this hair brained tale was the only thing he could think up to save himself from being beaten to death by the woman.
834517,lew,2014-02-04 22:17:00,12766," Did it say somewhere that he was fat? What I read said he was emaciated.  Yes, it said emaciated but sure doesn't look like it in the picture."

834537,glen,2014-02-05 00:15:00,2641,He must of had some great fishing. To bad he didn't have a camera.
834565,BillM,2014-02-05 02:08:00,17367,He probably ate the other guy..
834567,solopaddler,2014-02-05 02:23:00,8605,It's a hoax.  It's really the bearded guy from the movie The Hangover.
