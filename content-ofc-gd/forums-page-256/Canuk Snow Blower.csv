835005,moxie,2014-02-07 02:28:00,1566,Hope he has deep pockets cause the fuel economy must suck. Neat machine none the less.
835390,mattyk,2014-02-09 11:41:00,2110,That's cool!
835408,Canuck2fan,2014-02-09 16:29:00,1444,"If you can afford the time, parts and have the brains to build it paying for the fuel is probably a non issue. Sort of like the people who buy a boat with twin 200 etecs whining about the cost of oil consumption LOL  Also around here if he didn't incorporate a way to send the snow straight up so the wind can move off the driveway the blower would be useless anyhow. Banks are getting too high for normal snow blowers to be able to blow the snow high enough now and it is snowing again. And again and again and again.  Glad I live in an apartment where my snow clearing consists of calling the owner and saying if you want a rent cheque you better get over here and clear the driveway so I can get to work and earn some money LOL"
