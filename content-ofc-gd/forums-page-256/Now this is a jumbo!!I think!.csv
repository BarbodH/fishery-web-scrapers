835257,Bob,2014-02-08 04:18:00,370,"You may find this hard to believe but back in the day, (40 years ago maybe) 3lb perch were not that rare. This is before smelt infested Simcoe. When the smelts got there, lake trout started feeding on them instead of perch and the perch got overpopulated and became stunted. Back then, nobody even thought about a world record perch. What? It's a panfish. Do they keep records for them even? Funny today but I actually saw a perch pulled onto the wharf at Beaverton that touched over four pounds. Not by me but the guy next to me and just after I had pulled one in at 3 1/2. Just at iceout in the spring. You may not believe this but I was there and I don't care."
