834899,tb4me,2014-02-06 19:31:00,3295,This was awesome and very much worth sharing! I dont suspect water levels to be a concern as it was last couple yearsI cant help but wonder how bad the flooding is going to be this spring.. I gotta admit im worried as the Grand River is a minute from my door and its froze solid..Ice daming could be a major issue with all the water flooding into the Grand..

834901,highdrifter,2014-02-06 19:51:00,2534,Wow.  Just.. Wow.  The spring flows will be awesome!
834977,Gallie,2014-02-07 01:33:00,1215,Theres gonna be some fun treks into the bush this spring.
835003,moxie,2014-02-07 02:22:00,1566,"Yup, just like the good ol' days. We'll be fishing closer to peoples rear decks than we did last spring."
835039,bigugli,2014-02-07 05:15:00,6138,Should make for another extended maple syrup season.

835268,fishindevil,2014-02-08 08:45:00,6254,I know I had to drive to st.micheals hospital yesterday and all through the GTA I was laughing at their huge 15cm snowstorm !!!! Big deal the ground is valet covered and their snowbanks are only 20 inches high. !!!!! Hahaha quite funny .... But yes I fear there will be flooding in the same areas as last year like Haliburton minden burnt river as well as along the Trent Severn waterway of course depending on how fast the melt happens and how fast the citiots who control the waterway react to the spring melt !!!! They were asleep last year when it happened and we have a lot more snow this year .... So I guess it's wait & see ....I hope it doesn't happen again but I fear it will
835469,Sinker,2014-02-10 00:42:00,8692,"Oh ya, im sure we can count on some flooding this spring. Trent severn will be a mess for sure, those guys cant get it right on a dry spring.  We need it though, so bring it on. The more snow and cold the better if you ask me, and I have to deal with the snow every day from plowing, to shoveling, to blowing, to grooming. Im burnt, but its a pretty neat winter so far!  S."
835470,BillM,2014-02-10 00:48:00,17367,Hopefully all the rivers are blown out before opener so the fish do their thing and get back to the lake before the onslaught happens!
835471,strik,2014-02-10 01:15:00,175,First picture is my home town.  Got to love all the snow
835518,Headhunter,2014-02-10 14:49:00,5703,"Let's hope that the cold winter we have had, has an impact on that nasty Horned Beatle eating up our trees...and yes, a sudden warm spell would be a potential disaster for many. HH"
835548,aznphil,2014-02-10 18:18:00,73,Hopefully all the rivers are blown out before opener so the fish do their thing and get back to the lake before the onslaught happens! at least they will have a proper melt this year compared to last's
835550,BillM,2014-02-10 18:19:00,17367,"at least they will have a proper melt this year compared to last's  Yup, should be a good year for the fish."
