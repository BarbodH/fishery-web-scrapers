833637,bassjnkie,2014-01-31 02:05:00,1101,Does Lebaron still have their no tax sale any more.. Or Did I miss it?
833641,mcdougy,2014-01-31 02:17:00,274,I know that October had a no tax event
833642,captpierre,2014-01-31 02:18:00,2521,Usually during the Sportsman Show and perhaps Spring Fishing Show
833678,tizfun,2014-01-31 04:23:00,292,"Was there earlier today to return an item that I had purchased 3 weeks ago.. They gave me some slack on their 10 day refund/exchange policy, but I was good with just a credit note or offering to buy some tackle (which I don't really need) for the refund..  Anyway, they ended up giving me a full refund.. I was surprised and shocked...  Thank You..  While there 2 weeks ago, we were looking at the electronics and my buddy commented on the Lowrance Elite 7 being $1.00 less that Bass Pro  $768.00...   Well today while waiting to see if they were going to give me a refund, I walked over to the same unit and it was marked  with a big orange tag ""SPECIAL"" $728.00...  Are they serious ??  Guess they are getting ready for their no tax event...   I sure won't be there..  Tiz"
833685,BFSC Kevin,2014-01-31 04:48:00,1351,"I think it is now priced at 728 due to the new calender year,  which also means new catalogue and new pricing. That's just my assumption.."
833686,irishfield,2014-01-31 04:50:00,26272,I'm still trying to figure out what the issue is that it was a dollar cheaper than BPS.. and now it's $41 cheaper than BPS??! and he won't be there..
833725,moxie,2014-01-31 15:20:00,1566,I'm still trying to figure out what the issue is that it was a dollar cheaper than BPS.. and now it's $41 cheaper than BPS??! and he won't be there.. Shhhhhhhhhh!!! It's a coded message Wayne.

I think he is implying that since the ""tax free event"" only applies to items not already on sale, that they purposely reduce big ticket items before the sale... Just a guess..."
833758,irishfield,2014-01-31 18:23:00,26272,AH... now I get it.. marked down 5 so they don't have to give you 13... kinda like a snake oil salesman..gottcha !
833803,tizfun,2014-01-31 22:26:00,292,Sorry all.. it was a typo error... They have priced it at $828.00... All I was implying is that 3 weeks ago it was $758.00 and now it's $70.00 more.. They said that Lowrance increased the price on the Elite 7 Gold combos..  Sorry for the mix up...  Tiz
833823,strik,2014-02-01 00:04:00,175,it would be interesting to know what bps has it on for  now .  I`ve been trying to contact lowrance about getting a hds hat  however the email thing  has not been going well. It seem they only have one style hat for sale to US customers.  :wallbash:
833843,tizfun,2014-02-01 02:04:00,292,Was there yesterday as well... $769.00 for the Elite 7 Gold....   $739.00 for Humminbird 859c HD DI which is comparable....
833848,miller,2014-02-01 02:12:00,223,Lowrance did raise the costs to dealers
834606,mcdougy,2014-02-05 06:02:00,274,No tax event starts feb 5th according to website
834612,Terry,2014-02-05 09:36:00,14456,"yup got an email, no tax sale"
834655,bassjnkie,2014-02-05 16:51:00,1101,Thanks all..
