834976,Gallie,2014-02-07 01:31:00,1215,"I was out there a week and a half ago and there were some pretty serious drifts, i imagine they are a little deeper now. I tried to drive out on cooks bay monday but the snow was too deep for my truck so i had to take the trike. Call bonnies boats, they might be able to help you"

834994,Sinker,2014-02-07 02:06:00,8692,"Its tough going out there. I was out yesterday in the storm, and im glad I didnt drive out. The walk was BRUTAL, but better than being stuck out there, alone, in the truck.  Saw one full size truck go out, but he was moving! Not sure what happened when he stopped. He was dragging snow with the bottom of the truck the whole way.  I hope you have good rubber, and know how to drive!! Bring a shovel and a tow strap for sure!  S."
835018,Gallie,2014-02-07 03:12:00,1215,I have a ford ranger level 2 with a 6 inch body lift and 33 inch tires and it was sketchy the first time. I would be hard pressed to drive out by myself.
