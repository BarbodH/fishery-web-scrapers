834082,Steve Piggott,2014-02-02 15:01:00,196,"With the mild weather,decided to get the boat out.Spent the day catching walleye and pike. A little work on the ramp to launch the boat. Broke a tail light on ice when we put the boat in. Forgot the landing net,but we manage to land a some nice fish.  "

834362,Steve Piggott,2014-02-04 00:13:00,196,"Theres some dedication!   No judgement, just wondering if you eat those slobs from there.   Bacon wrapped and barbecued! I will eat the smaller ones some times,but there is a good chance for a 15lb plus fish this time of year .Walleye closes at the end of  month on the Niagara."
