I fished consistently, but never enough.  Fishing has a way of bringing you back though.  I was able to get a very close friend very addicted to fishing and we've enjoyed many trips.  I was monkeying around for bass in the fall and then the single-most defining (and potentially expensive) moment happened.  WHAM.  Reel screaming, heart pumping, me swearing.  ""I don't think this is a ba...""  Fish swims by ""ITS NOT A BASS BRO!""  He's kind of staring cluelessly.  ""Why aren't you video-taping this or something""  At this point I had seen the fish and knew that I had my first Musky.  I landed it quickly, released it quickly and had it back in the water after a few pictures.    A few casts later I caught another, smaller 'ski.    A few months later and I have all the appropriate gear to properly fish for Musky.  I was then trolling Kijiji for new gear and I came across a St. Croix Legend Musky Rod.  I messaged the seller and we remembered eachothers names.  Fisherpete was the owner of the Rod and we arranged a price and delivery.  He was kind enough to include some extra gear and it was nice connecting with the community again.  I look forward to posting reports of all the trips we have planned this summer.  I am also looking for suggestions on a mid-range SUV (not a gas hog, not a crossover) that can tow a mid-range boat  We will be on Nipissing for the opener and for a week in August.  If anyone wants to have a few pops, send me a message.  Cheers to Pete.  It is good to be back."

834747,Rod Caster,2014-02-05 23:58:00,5784,"Ya, welcome back! I'd love to see a successful Nipissing Musky-opener report!"
834769,Fisherpete,2014-02-06 01:20:00,1814,"Thanks for the kind words Ryan - and glad to have you back!  There's a spot for you in my boat whenever you want to try your hand at Kawartha muskies.  As for mid range SUV... I would not recommend my Escape as a tow vehicle - it does OK with my boat, but my boat/trailer/motor etc. is probably around 1000lbs. Andrew (Lunkerhunter here on the board) does very well with his Nissan X-Terra... pulls his 18ft Princecraft around pretty well, even up the ramp in Dunnville in March.  Welcome to the world of musky addiction THERE IS NO CURE"
834993,moxie,2014-02-07 02:05:00,1566,"Welcome back. Honda Pilot is not really an SUV per say but has tow power, VTM 4WD for slippery ramp situations, fuel efficiency and one hell of a smooth ride."
835016,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-07 02:59:00,932,Thanks again Pete.  Check your pm momentarily.   I have not considered the newer escapes because of the 13+ recalls on the 2013 model.  This is giving me something to think about.  I like the looks of the vehicle as well.  Thanks for the reply
