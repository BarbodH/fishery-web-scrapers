Lets just make it short and sweet they killed it! He ties trolling flies for downrigging and bucktails for  multispecies. I can vouch for how effective his lures are and how durable/realistic they are, yeah I know this sounds like an infomercial but he deserves some credit. Like him on facebook:Custom Fishing Tackle by James Schembrihttps://www.facebook.com/CustomFishingTackleByJamesSchembri Here are some of the lures that did the damage from the weekend 14' of water jigging on bottom and 4-6"" off bottom.   couple of bruisers from the day out... green glow grub tipped with a naked and tipped with a shiner both proved effective.    some other smaller glow flies. lake trout killer, looks like friggin candy and it gets bit believe me!heading out this weekend for some more action, stay safe out there!"

We tip it with a minnow and they blend together seamlessly. No joke I caught a total of 50+ pike, bass and walleye in the kawarthas on just one jig befor i got broken off by a huge pike...Friggin floro leader failed, but he tied me 5 more identical jigs  look at his facebok page to see that jig and a few other beauties!"
