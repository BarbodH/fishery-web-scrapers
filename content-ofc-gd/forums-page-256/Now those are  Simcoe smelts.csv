Ya, lost a whitie at the hole. Knocked the jig out of it,s mouth.. .  Blue clouds going through the finder.Yup,it was smelt.These are the smelt I remember catching years back. Just enough for a fresh feed. Thats a 12"" bowl.     All these smelts were caught on the skud made by our own Christopher K."

835427,Terry,2014-02-09 19:05:00,14456,"I am hoping to get out soon and catch something , damn I hate moving"
835430,limeyangler,2014-02-09 19:27:00,5204,"Wow…those are some nice smelt! We aint allowed to catch those here, i think the MNR turn up in the middle of the night and disappear people who even speak the word….oh no…i'm doomed"

835445,Joey,2014-02-09 22:27:00,9122,"Nice haul B.  We were out there again today and dang if we can get those lakers to commit  Paul did catch a huge herring, and back in she went.  Any tips anyone has got for the lakers would be appreciated.  I think I went through my whole tacklebox today.  They come up for a sniff, chase for a short spurt, then head back to the bottom each time.  Very frustrating."
835475,Fisherpete,2014-02-10 01:54:00,1814,You are one smelty fella Brian LOL Those look tasty... last time I had smelts was in the early 80's when my grandfather brought home a BUSHEL of them. Spent the afternoon cleaning them with grandma... then the fry YUM  Joey - PM sent. I have no commitment issues with my lakers - or is it the other way around haha  Pete
835476,Rod Caster,2014-02-10 02:01:00,5784,Cool catch. Never even tried or considered ice fishing for smelt.
835482,chris.brock,2014-02-10 02:17:00,4053,"nice catch, it's been 30+ years since I ate some of my Grandfathers caught smelt  with smelt like that, I can see where the giant lakers, pike and walleye come from- soft rayed, fatty and plentiful"
835487,Christopheraaron,2014-02-10 03:13:00,3525,Good to hear that they're working for ya! Those guys look very tasty.
835578,misfish,2014-02-10 21:29:00,29133,"Dave,those are seas run ones? Those are huge man.  I knew they would work well Christopher. They catch perch and herring as well. It looks like a natural fresh water shrimp."
835586,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-10 22:28:00,10439,Those are ciscoes Brian. They do grow to a pretty decent size though. This area is a set of falls between the lake I'm building my cabin on and Great Slave. They run there in the fall to spawn. Haven't tried eating them as they are bait to catch food sized fish.
835587,misfish,2014-02-10 22:32:00,29133, They are great smoked Dave. Try them. Great snacks when out on the ice. I cant wait til they are re-open here.
835599,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-10 23:10:00,10439,Great laker and pike bait too.
