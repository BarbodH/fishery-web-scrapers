834771,Roy,2014-02-06 01:22:00,13728,So where are you hearing this? Certainly not the property owners (Ivanhoe-Cambridge). Not their legal section either. Vaughan Mills gets 13.5 million visitors a year......that's a lot of folks to be walking away from.
834775,GBW,2014-02-06 01:41:00,8460,I am hearing this from a Toronto Law Firm I know personally.  That BPS is gone if the grants are not renewed.  Hence the items in the store like the big fish tank (allows for a grant discount).  That is there as a TAX and GRANT use.  Not to just show people the fish as much as they lead you to believe...
834779,GBW,2014-02-06 01:46:00,8460,"Just because Vaughn Mills get's ""13.5M"" people a year does NOT mean they are all going to BPS and that 13.5M people are all spending even $1 in BPS.  Stat's are not always reflective of the truth.  After all 71.9% of stat's are made up on the spot to make things sound better than they are.  How do I know that stat?  Yeah, I made it up but I bet I'm DAMN close to the real stat..."

No different than the MNR tanks I've stared at during the Sportsmen and Fishing shows these past 50 years. I also get to see a much wider selection of product, and ideas, than any where else but the trade shows. Once in a blue moon I may buy something that catches my eye, or for the right price. Like the 1/2 price fish fryer I picked up a few years back.  I'll probably enjoy strolling through the new Cabelas just as much."

Just looking for more insight from others that might have it is all. Or since they're opening up  more outlets they figure they'd make a little noise so they can extend or sweeten the deals they've already made. Squeaky wheel gettin grease and who knows what the hell else at our expense over and over and over and.........you get the idea.  Sure is nice to look at but I've only been there twice in the past year mainly due to the same old mainstream bobbles they have carried since the very beginning. Peg boards are nicely stocked but a store of that size should carry every size, weight and colour of every brand. A store that size should  strive and pride itself in becoming the one stop shopping experience and has fallen short for me on more than a few occasions.  That is why the dying breed of local ma and pa outlet is so important. There you can usually find what you need and not what the box stores want you to buy. They will unfortunately pay the ultimate price as these giants ramp up operations.  I doubt BPS will go anywhere with Cabelas honing in on a piece of their market share but to tell you the truth it wouldn't bother me one bit if they did.  I could care even less than Landry does if they left either."

834813,Canuck2fan,2014-02-06 03:21:00,1444,"Just sounds like a classic case of ""threaten big"" when you are dealing with governments, probably some junior crat has a P3TA fetish and said in the early discussions that they weren't going to renew anything. Then the big crats will get involved and the store will be given away literally in this case LOL. The truth is we survived economically before they came here and we will survive if they leave.  That being said I spend money there whenever I am in the area 3.5 hr drive for me so I don't go that often. I DO enjoy buying from the website with the NO SHIPPING charges to Canada though.  +1 on what Wayne said, I had a friend who used to make motorcycle fairings and was looking to expand here. Just as he was looking to hire 10 people Oakville insisted he put in a down draft paint booth because one neighbour complained about the smell of the fiberglass curing...(which he figured wouldn't have been helped by any paint booth).  He shopped around and Tennessee gave him the use of a plant 3 times bigger than he needed rent free for 5yrs (which he was allowed to rent out the space he didn't need and KEEP the money. They paid to train his workers for 3 months, and no state tax for the first 3yrs as long as he kept 5 employees on for 35hrs a week.... When he signed up they told him later there was more they could have offered LOL. Now of course under Nafta those are all no nos but he said he could live with himself for accepting the offer."

So I'm trying to find some more info as to a FEW things I have been hearing (for about a month now) and they are from legit sources; IE legal and property owners.  Has anyone else heard info about BPS looking to move from Vaughan because the Canadian Government Grant (basically 1/2 price rent since they have been there or better) is running out?  They would close the store I'm told and walk free and clear from all the past business.  Warranty too in Canada,  I duno...  They open up locations based on what the Government Grants are to give them huge discounts on rent and taxes.  Hence the locations in the USA being so random too. This I DO KNOW.  Any news to help here is much appreciated, thanks.  G"

834718,landry,2014-02-05 22:23:00,1005,I could care less if they left.
834719,Steve,2014-02-05 22:26:00,2075,the chinese imported crap would have to find another location to be hawked if BPS left.
834724,Roy,2014-02-05 23:06:00,13728,"I could care less if they left.  In other words, you care if they leave?"
834725,landry,2014-02-05 23:08:00,1005,No. I won't miss them. The store is cool inside but I still shop at the smaller stores or online. I like the carbonlite rods though.
834729,jedimaster,2014-02-05 23:15:00,3472,"Meh, If it wasn't for the odd time a family member gives me a gift card I don't think I would ever go. So many warranty issues and return hassles its just not worth it. Not to mention the prices are typically brutal, staff rude and rarely have any stock on items on sale."

834731,davey buoy,2014-02-05 23:22:00,5505,"We had a discussion some time back.I enjoy going in from time to time,and I find the employees pretty help full for the most part. Many here have had good experiences on returned or warranty items.I myself went for a small sleigh,called a day ahead,had lots.Arrived,sold out.Offered me a bigger one for the same price.Not bad,sure glad I didn't buy the small one .Can hardly fit what I have now .lol."
