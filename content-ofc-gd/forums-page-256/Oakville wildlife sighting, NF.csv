834820,BillM,2014-02-06 03:40:00,17367,Awesome!

834833,Joeytier,2014-02-06 04:42:00,3990,Never spotted a saw-whet before...lucky you!
834834,cram,2014-02-06 06:07:00,1733,Neat.  Curious - how do you tell between a screech and a saw whet?
834857,chris.brock,2014-02-06 14:35:00,4053,"I think you're right, it looks like a screech"
834862,SmokestackLightnin,2014-02-06 15:15:00,390,The main difference between Screech and Saw Whet is Screech Owls have pointed ear tufts (like the Great Horned) that are often raised.  The Saw Whet does not have ear tufts.  What really surprises me is you have robins?
834865,cuzza,2014-02-06 16:15:00,467,"Very cool - used to see/hear one just like sat in the tree outside my old place near Appleby College, probably watching all the robins we had too"
834879,Squid,2014-02-06 17:18:00,1656,Pretty cool having nature around our houses in the 'city'
834887,cram,2014-02-06 17:57:00,1733,"I think you're right, it looks like a screech Wasn't saying it was....honestly just wondered. We get a couple of those in our yard through the summer (also in Oakville), and I wanted to know which type it is.  When the tufts are down it is hard to differentiate in the dark."
834896,206,2014-02-06 19:19:00,563,Not a good sign...A Robin? The first sign of spring and it's eaten up and spit out  Cool tho and you got a pic!!

835043,chris.brock,2014-02-07 05:30:00,4053,"I googled it and copied this  Winter Birds Myth: American robins always fly south for winter. Winter Birds Fact: If there is sufficient food on their breeding grounds, American robins, bluebirds, and a host of finches and owls remain in the area where they spent the summer. As these birds often eat insects, they will instead forage among tree bark for overwintering bugs rather than on the frozen ground, where youâ€™re more likely to see them in spring and summer  I'll get a picture of them if I get a chance, they spend the nights in our cedars, if you don't believe me you could ask my cat"
835069,aplumma,2014-02-07 13:06:00,6896,Kind of like the hybrid Canadian Virginia geese. We have an established population here it seems it is to far to fly all the way back up North.lol   Art

835112,farsider,2014-02-07 16:56:00,456,"Thats very cool!  Thanks for sharing Chris.  I always enjoy it when the Cooper's/Sharp Shinned makes an appearance around the backyard feeder for a meal of Mourning Dove. Or when the Opossum, Fox, Groundhog, Coyote, etc. show up and remind us that Nature isn't just in the awesome ""Up North"" area but, anywhere they can eke out an existance.  Cheers,  Mark"
