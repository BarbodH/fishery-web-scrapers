834610,NAW,2014-02-05 08:22:00,4022,"Some great shots!!  Thanks Wayne!  In fact, I may head up this weekend, if I'm not to hung over Saturday!"
834622,Locnar,2014-02-05 12:20:00,645,Those pictures are right cool man. Looks like some beauty weather too.
834624,BillM,2014-02-05 12:44:00,17367,"Nice Wayne, I have no worries about taking the sled out there now, lol.   Looks like it's been well traveled."
834638,NAW,2014-02-05 15:03:00,4022,"I can see two of my honey holes in these pics...  How deep of power would stop you from landing the plane Wayne?  There's was about 18"" of powder on the lake 2 weeks ago."
834664,irishfield,2014-02-05 17:57:00,26272,Have over 3 feet of snow in the yard Nick that I left from.. the lake isn't any issue. First flyable day in a long long time...  Will try to get some more pics up later... computer didn't have enough memory left (of my 300+GB) last night to resize the 140 or so pictures I took during a 2 hour cruise around Simcoe County and Georgian Bay Township yesterday.  The snow globe may have finally stopped...... GBay and Nottawasaga Bay are frozen right out past the Westerns.
834696,misfish,2014-02-05 20:39:00,29133,Caught some real nice bass out from that cottage on the left. And just down from there by the little island on the right(which is not in the pic).LOL  Cool shots Wayne.
834699,Terry,2014-02-05 21:06:00,14456,...... GBay and Nottawasaga Bay are frozen right out past the Westerns. what is the Westerns.
834700,misfish,2014-02-05 21:35:00,29133,what is the Westerns.  
834711,irishfield,2014-02-05 22:12:00,26272,This is the lighthouse for them in better weather..    It's a massive shoal system about 3 miles North of Christian Island / Giants Tomb  
834714,davey buoy,2014-02-05 22:19:00,5505,"Spent many years camping on Giants Tomb,always had to watch that shoal extension when coming out of Penetang then heading out to the Tomb.It sneaks up on you fast even though your way off shore.Great picture! From Cedar Point,not a problem ."
834716,irishfield,2014-02-05 22:21:00,26272,I'll see if I can get some more downsized and uploaded tonight. Got a few good shots of the Tomb and surroundings yesterday.
834727,NAW,2014-02-05 23:10:00,4022,"A guy at work told me he was on some government ice website, which stated you could walk from manatoulin to tobermory this winter.  Seems fishy..."
834737,irishfield,2014-02-05 23:32:00,26272,Based on what I saw yesterday.. I wouldn't doubt if it's frozen out there as well.  If I knew where your house was Nick I would have got a shot... only reference I have is someone wrote HI MOM in the snow in front of one place on the South shore.. lol.. and the F-in-laws horse farm on the North side.  I'd say I'm glad I didn't pay for all that fence board... but I probably did!
834742,NAW,2014-02-05 23:46:00,4022,I'll pm ya my cords!
834767,irishfield,2014-02-06 01:08:00,26272,"Well I've got to many computer issues and server issues to get anymore pics up properly it seems tonight, but here's a video I quickly shot with my camera just sitting up on the dash yesterday. I call these ""box spot"" landings... and it's good practice for hitting a spot. Sled grid in the snow... you have to land and take off without crossing a sled trail. The first one is an immediate departure.. thanks to a sound you get use to of rough or pack ice under the snow that will clean the gear off the plane. As the video starts, that is Giants Tomb Island and all landings are between it and heading towards Gin Rocks.    "
834774,mcdougy,2014-02-06 01:39:00,274,"what does the title mean? "" Box landings with DJK on skis""  DJK?"
834797,BillM,2014-02-06 02:27:00,17367,"A guy at work told me he was on some government ice website, which stated you could walk from manatoulin to tobermory this winter.  Seems fishy...  Only open water in GBay is in Owen Sound due to the ice breaker.   I wouldn't be surprised if you could snowmobile from Tobermory to Manitoulin this winter."
