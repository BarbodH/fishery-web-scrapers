I just put a U-bolt thru a piece of wood about 9"" long i.e about 3"" longer than the 6"" bore of the auger. It fits loosely on the shaft and be easily removed for storage.  I tested it on about 10"" of ice and it went thru easily using a DeWalt 18V. The problem I had was the drill coming off the hole saw even though the shaft on the saw is hex. The chuck on the drill is tightened by hand rather than a key. "

834241,SirCranksalot,2014-02-03 14:41:00,3291,"Does anybody know if you can buy a keyed chuck for that type of DeWalt drill? I checked their site and a couple of more online (Home Depot etc) and could not find anything.  The piece of wood is, I admit, not the sleekest looking solution to prevent losing the auger but it's easy and it works."
834305,misfish,2014-02-03 21:58:00,29133,"When your drilling,are you in low or high? ? You want to be on low for slow turn and torqe.Dont push on the augar. Let it cut with just the weight of the drill. I have found with the thicker ice,you need to drill,lift,drill lift.  And watch out for yer know what with that wood piece.LOL"
834415,Big Cliff,2014-02-04 10:05:00,6899,"If I am understanding what I see on that wood piece, it just slips in the U-bolt as the shaft is spinning so the wood isn't turning. I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work and I think it is a good idea but I still like the idea of the fixed disc better."
834479,Hoppy,2014-02-04 18:12:00,95,"I've have had the ""Ice. Master"" a couple of years now and I think it's great. There solution for ensuring the auger is not lost down the hole also takes the weight off the drill bearings. It uses a nylon friction disc and a bungie. Simple elegant solution that could easily be replicate.  "

834544,SirCranksalot,2014-02-05 00:30:00,3291,"I drilled a couple of holes on Simcoe today as part of a Simcoe Ice Drilling Team    outing without much trouble. It was hardly worth taking the drill for the sake of a couple of holes but I wanted to try it out a bit more than I had. The chuck just came loose once. That was when I put it in reverse to get it back up from the hole. I drilled/lifted/drilled/lifted as Brian suggested above.  The main reason for posting the pix above was to tell others of a fairly easy way to attach the drill to the auger: A number of people expressed interest in Brian's conversion but most of us don't have some of the tools that he used----e.g. welder.  The wood piece to stop the auger from dropping thru the hole is to me , of secondary interest. There are many ways of skinning that proverbial cat. The wood  slides down the shaft under its own weight and sometimes spins with the auger. Yes, it's a good idea to keep 'vital parts' away from it  , but it can be stopped from spinning with very little force because it's a loose fit. A circular piece of plywood would look neater but  would take up more space when stashing the auger unto the toboggan."
834618,Big Cliff,2014-02-05 11:04:00,6899,"Some really good ideas here, I still like the idea of Brian's extension though, it would make my life a lot easier. My back likes the idea too LOL."
