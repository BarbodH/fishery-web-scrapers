827230,sneak_e_pete,2013-12-29 20:59:00,540,"Hi there, I am looking to take my 6 year old ice fishing and am looking for some recommendations.  I normally hit North Bay for a couple days, but budget isn't allowing that this year.  $$$ is a factor for me, but I also want to make sure that he gets some fish.  Can you recommend an outfitter?  Best time of year to go?  Thanks in advance."

827336,Acountdeleted,2013-12-30 03:24:00,2562,Go for Goy. A great stand up guy and he always puts the huts on a pile of perch. $40 per person for the full day.
827426,Governator,2013-12-30 17:45:00,879,Peter from Cooks Bay Fishing Board.  Can't really go wrong there.  Plus his vids are a good source if you go alone.
827462,Locnar,2013-12-30 19:55:00,645,"I've never rented a hut on Cooks Bay, but I usually use Peter's ice reports and those are a ton of help. For that I'd recommend him. I've had lots of luck out on Cooks for Jumbos, more so than other ""Jumbo"" grounds. Anyone know of a decent operator for lakers or whities?"
827555,pidge,2013-12-31 02:34:00,438,"Google ""Casey's ice huts"" in Port Bolster. Used him and only him for day huts. Really good guy that runs a good ace for ice fishing. Night time acomd. As well, but never went that route. Biggest perch caught there with plenty others for the table. Thumbs up Tah can't wait for 2014!!     "
827558,bigugli,2013-12-31 03:11:00,6138,"I'm sorry, but I would recommend anywhere but Casey's. Last year I went out on a foursome. We had a hut loaded with garbage, and excrement in a bucket. It had not been cleaned after the previous occupant. The argo used to run us out barely got us out or back as it continually tried to stall out and the one drive kept failing leaving us going in a circle until it re-engaged. The driver was tanked on the trip back in.  At the very least, one has to keep facilities clean and maintained."
827570,Sinker,2013-12-31 03:54:00,8692,"Im REALLY surprised to hear that Bruce! Wow....  Been using caseys for as long as I can remember and never had a single bad thing to say. New owners have been pretty good to me and my fishing buddies, but without Casey and Leona, the place certainly isnt the same. They were the nicest people on the lake, and I learned a ton about that lake fron 'ole Casey.  Sorry to hear you had a bad experience there. I would recommend them to anyone.  S."
827594,pidge,2013-12-31 08:47:00,438,"Damm we had perch in our bucket lol. Sucks you had a bad time, but I haven't had a bad experience there."
827598,turtle,2013-12-31 11:38:00,274,Tim Hales on the east side north of Beaverton.  Huts and equipment are always in good shape.  Parking is on his own property.  Office has interesting mounts and spears/decoys from the old days.  Fishing is usally good for perch.
827619,sneak_e_pete,2013-12-31 14:10:00,540,Thanks for the recommendations.  Booked with Goy...cant wait.  I am used to catching Perch on a drop-shot with minnow on Lake Erie....same idea on Simcoe?

Some people here tend to complain about his advertising methods and videos claiming safe ice and putting unknowers in danger.  Personally I think he does an excellent job and I've never had a bad experience with him.  I think he works very hard with getting the information out there and if it helps boosts his business good for him."
