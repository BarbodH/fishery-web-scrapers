549336,eyefish,2011-02-09 12:51:00,135,Tightlines in Pickering carries them as a matter of fact I remember taking them out of the box yesterday. If you don't get there by Saturday though they will be at the Spring fishing and boat show!  Todd 
549339,Gregoire,2011-02-09 13:15:00,1397,I am interested as well. I am looking for a rod to match up with my recently purchased Pflueger Patriarch. The lightet the better. Just out of curiousity what is the price point of the rapala rod? I am also considering a St. Croix avid.
