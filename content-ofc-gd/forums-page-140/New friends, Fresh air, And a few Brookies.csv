954626,Freshtrax,2016-01-24 19:25:00,2215,"One of my favourite parts about fishing is in the planning ,  and i got to share that ckewley and sleepjigging  over the last week and it finally came to fruition yesterday.  We met early and after introductions and some much needed coffees we were headed north to our destination.  Some of their pals, and some of mine met us at the jump off point for our trek into the unknown ( nobody in the group of 7 had fished this lake before).  A great day was had by all, the fishing was slow but we did manage a few.   I had a blast lets do it again soon.        "

954719,wormdunker,2016-01-25 08:34:00,1711,Looks like a beautiful day!  Those brookies are awesome!  It's nice to meet new people that share your passion.  I've recently met some very nice fellow fishers from this board who are great people.  Most recently the G2G in Hamilton.
954731,ckewley,2016-01-25 12:20:00,699,"It was great to meet you & your buddies Freshtrax! True the day was slow but couldn't ask for a better day on the ice, even the Russians didn't mind the temps. Totally agree, should do it again soon! Brian B anytime man I'm always down for fishing!! Think Bain has a picture of the monster pumpkinseed that one of the Russian's caught but refused to pose with it.....  Great pictures BTW man!"

954842,Freshtrax,2016-01-25 23:03:00,2215,"i actually got a sun burn!   it was a beauty day out there, not a cloud in the sky from sun up till sun down"
954869,Moosebunk,2016-01-26 01:20:00,3970,What a great way for a bunch of doods to get to know one another.  Bushwhacking some specks.  Great!

955296,atvaholic,2016-01-29 01:31:00,271,Those are some fat little brookies! Nice trip report and way to go braving the cold!
955311,Fisherpete,2016-01-29 03:14:00,1814,"Great report, nice going guys. Love that second pic as the sun is rising. Beautiful brookies too, on my bucket list.  As for the monster pumpkinseed - I highly recommend Advanced Taxidermy. They do amazing work and will capture every fantastic detail of that spectacular piscatorial accomplishment. I suggest a huge driftwood log as a background.  Pete"
