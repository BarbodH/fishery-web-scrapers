954919,DanD,2016-01-26 11:53:00,2223,Got the last three pics back up; but still waiting for the other host to get the rest back up?  Dan.
954924,wormdunker,2016-01-26 12:19:00,1711,Awesome job Dan!  I love it!  Is your trailer from Fast Freight?
954927,DanD,2016-01-26 12:41:00,2223,I bought the trailer from the Harbor Freight store in Port Huron; before our dollar went for a dump. 2000lb axle with a tilt deck for around $300.00.    Dan.
955132,mr blizzard,2016-01-27 19:37:00,1589,"Dan, unfortunately I can't see any of the pics. There is a square that says in bold black letters "" IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE"" with a X on a red octagon. x2 Dan would love to see the pics being the originals you posted,"
955213,wormdunker,2016-01-28 08:16:00,1711,Yah Harbour Freight.  Me bad - Fast Freight??  My sin in law has one.  Great for small haulage jobs.  Or in your case more importantly - a fish hut!
955257,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-28 18:55:00,2582,"Dan, unfortunately I can't see any of the pics. There is a square that says in bold black letters "" IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE"" with a X on a red octagon.  Same here for your original first posting of pictures. Hope you can reshare them somehow. Would love to see them all."
955392,DanD,2016-01-29 21:10:00,2223,I used up my bandwidth on the hosing site; I've paid for an upgrade; but for some reason it hasn't kicked in yet??  Dan.
955647,wormdunker,2016-02-01 13:38:00,1711,Just a thought for you Dan.  Make sure you secure your hole covers to the floor as you are travelling across the ice.  Snow whipping up as you travel will find it's way into your hut.  I know this from past experiences with my hut.
953791,DanD,2016-01-18 19:53:00,2223,"The plan is to drive to the lake towing the trailer with the snowmobile on it. Get to the lake, unload the snowmobile and then hook the trailer/fish hut to the snowmobile. Been working on this for a while; bought the 1500lb cap. tilt trailer last year   Put a 7'X10' deck on it, to haul the sled around.   Made up a set of skies, out of a 16' extension ladder (love Kijiji for cheap stuff) that attach to the wheels of the trailer, with a ratchet straps.  I was able to haul out all our gear and three guys; all on the trailer at once. It actually pulled so easy that I kept looking back; thinking the trailer came off the hitch.    A friend had the tubing from one of those portable garages; that I thought would make a great frame for the enclosure of the trailer.    After welding all the tubing togeather and some cross bracing, made from 1"" X 1/8"" flat stock; it really firmed up the tube frame. Also roughed in the window(s) and furnace frame. Yes a 25,000 BTU RV furnace. I fish a lot outside; but when I want to get warm, it has to happen fast. LOL       I then started skinning the hut with 24 gage sheet metal. Overlapped the seams by 2"" and pop riveted every 3"".         Shot a coat of primer on the inside and out and then painted it with Tremclad dark blue gloss.        Installed the furnace.   Pre-wired the hut for the furnace, lighting, power ports (Cig Lighters), circulating fan (PC cooling fans) and an on-board battery charger/maintainer.  I also installed a circuit that I can flip a toggle switch and have all the exterior lights flash like a car's 4 way lights. Should make it easier for people, who are meeting me out on the ice to find me?   Then it was insulation time, installing the ducting for the furnace and build the benches.                   That's it so far. I still need to install the propane  regulator and line to the furnace. Make the hinged lids for the benches and OH yea cut the holes. LOL Here's what I'm hoping to do for the floor/hole plan. Probably never fish with 6 people in so I may not cut all of them in?   Depending on how well this whole thing works out; I plan on changing the axle to a drop down and get the frame down on the ice. For now I'm going to try using those roll up kid's sleds (magic carpet?) that Crappy tire sells.  There should be enough spring in the plastic; that when put through the hole rolled up from inside the hut, down to the ice; it should try and unroll and make a nice fit and stop the wind from blowing into the hut? I'm open for suggestions for things I may not of thought of?  Dan. "

953798,Terry,2016-01-18 20:37:00,14456,"very cool, dude"
953800,Headhunter,2016-01-18 20:42:00,5703,That looks sweet Dan! HH
953824,huzzsaba,2016-01-18 21:45:00,884,Nice Hut on Wheels!  Wish there was frozen water close by and I would have been working on a similar project.  Nice RX7 in the back!
953833,DanD,2016-01-18 22:00:00,2223,"Nice Hut on Wheels!  Wish there was frozen water close by and I would have been working on a similar project.  Nice RX7 in the back!  Thanks.  That's why there's wheels; may have to go looking for safe ice?  That's my son's 1987 RX7; with a bit more power then originally supplied with from the factory. It now has a LS1 5.7Lt (Corvette/Camaro V8) that has had a lot of performance work done to it. Behind the motor, there's a 6 speed manual from a Corvette. The last we had the car on a dyno, it was pushing better then 450 Hp at the wheels. Scary but fun little car; at only 1800 Lbs. LOL  Dan."
953839,Sinker,2016-01-18 22:23:00,8692,"That is sweet! A few buckets with the bottoms cut off would work good to stop the draft in the holes.  How much do you figure the whole thing weighs?  Slick unit, and well built! Good job!   S."
953840,wormdunker,2016-01-18 22:26:00,1711,Awesome job!  I love looking at other people's projects.  To stop the wind from coming up the fishing holes cut the bottom out of a 5 gallon pail.  Insert the pail down your hole to the ice.  Job done!  Make sure you cut the holes in your hut floor to suit the diameter of the pail.  Crazy carpet is good also.  The bottomless pails are stackable for storage.
953842,misfish,2016-01-18 22:30:00,29133,No areo? Front is flat. Think I said this before. LOL  Ok I like 150%
953843,Fisherman,2016-01-18 22:30:00,7201,"So if the wife puts you in the doghouse, we know where you're going.  Nice work!"
953845,porkpie,2016-01-18 22:34:00,2521,That's about the nicest fish hut I've ever seen!
953846,DanD,2016-01-18 22:36:00,2223,"How much do you figure the whole thing weighs?     S.  The trailer itself is 250 Lbs; I have tried my best to track the weight that I have added and i believe the total weight is approx 1000 -1100 Lbs Last year with the three guys on and our gear was Approx 800 Lbs plus the trailer weight and like I said I thought I lost the trailer, coming off the pavement onto the ice; it pulled so easy.  Dan."
953849,DanD,2016-01-18 22:41:00,2223,"So if the wife puts you in the doghouse, we know where you're going.  Nice work!  Man I'm almost there now; with the number of weekends working on it.  Dan."
953852,mukluk,2016-01-18 22:57:00,196,"Really nice job.   I can see you have did your very best at keeping the weight factor to a minimum also. I had a smaller version  and found the pails worked better than the magic carpet.  They stayed in place better in windy days.  I'm looking to make improvements and can't seem to find any.   Let us know how everything goes once it""s put into operation."
953854,wormdunker,2016-01-18 23:14:00,1711,I showed your hut to my wife.  Even she's impressed.  She really like the RV furnace!  1 question.  Will it catch fish?
953857,NAW,2016-01-18 23:17:00,4022,That's really good work man!!  Great job!
953875,Fisherman,2016-01-19 00:24:00,7201,There's only one thing missing...the brass pole.
953895,glen,2016-01-19 01:50:00,2641,Cool.  Very nice work.   Thought about building one like that before. I like windows on all sides.  6-8 holes  should be lots.  Don't cut the four center ones. Then you can walk around and stretch.   Build you seats like a comfy chair. Do you have a fridge and tv lol.
953908,can u fish,2016-01-19 02:55:00,326,That is going to be the sweetest ice hut on the lake when you get her done awesome job congrats.
953913,John Bacon,2016-01-19 03:08:00,3277,Great idea.  Much more practical than a Snowbear.
953960,leaf4,2016-01-19 13:53:00,2466,"Awesome setup! Could use a sonotube for the holes, wax up the part that meets the ice and you should be ok I would think"
954827,DanD,2016-01-25 22:08:00,2223,"Haven't quite finished yet; there's been no real rush, with the lack of what I consider safe ice; for this size of hut. It is coming though; got the benches finished and cut the holes in the floor. The four corners are all the same. The holes are not as round as I wanted; but that happens when you have had a couple of cocktails, while you're working on a project.    I did go with the 12 holes; but the lids will have latches, so the holes not being used will not be an issue. I also cut the holes on a 45Â° angle, so that the lids will not fall through the opening and is strong enough to walk on.    I've also added the (DOT) reflective tape and found/bought (Don't ask how much; I didn't and felt obliged to buy it, being special ordered) this flag to put on the door. If someone on a snowmobile can't see this at night; they'd have to be legally blind. LOL  Dan  "

954837,DanD,2016-01-25 22:47:00,2223,Yea I'll see if I can get this sorted; if not I'll re-post from another host?  Dan.
