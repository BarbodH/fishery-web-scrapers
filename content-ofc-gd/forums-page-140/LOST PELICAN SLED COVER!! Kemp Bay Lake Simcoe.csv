955365,kenzy31,2016-01-29 17:24:00,261,PLEASE HELP! Lost Pelican 60 sled cover about an hour ago on north shore Kemp Bay Lake Simcoe.  Wind direction was straight towards Bear Point on the South shore. If found please text or call 705-795-8121. Thank you to anyone who can help

955370,kenzy31,2016-01-29 17:48:00,261,lol I was thinking of driving around and maybe meeting it there. Punch a few holes for perch while I'm at it lol. But the gas money will be the same as a new cover

955390,kenzy31,2016-01-29 20:51:00,261,"It was laying inside the sled while we were in the hut, hiding from the wind lol. It has been ""re-covered!"" Thanks to the guys fishing in the open in front of me for snagging it and getting it to Todd  for me! Thanks guys, fisher-people kick ass!"
