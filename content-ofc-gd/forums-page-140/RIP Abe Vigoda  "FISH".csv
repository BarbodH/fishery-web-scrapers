955084,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 11:21:00,8243,"Good old Abe was an old man when I was a young man. No one could have played Tessio but Abe Vigoda.  Tessio bends over to whisper into Michaels ear ""Hey Mikey, Barzini want's a sit down, on my turf, don't worry I'll take care of security.""  Tom Hagen to Michael after Tessio leaves "" I always thought it would have been Clemenza.""  Michael Corleone ""No it's the smart move, Tessio was always the smart one""  Last act Godfather 1.  He will forever be Salvatore Tessio to me.  Reposo en Pace Abe"
