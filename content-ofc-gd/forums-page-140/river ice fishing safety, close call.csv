954811,highdrifter,2016-01-25 21:40:00,2534,"Fair enough..  I take it current and depth would play a part in that..  the spring thaw would have to be taken into consideration as well..  Pardon my ignorance, but who would you notify in a situation like this...  MOE?  5-0?  the ministry?!"
954813,EC1,2016-01-25 21:45:00,930,"Glad you're safe, that's the most important. Hopefully some things get recovered, and make sure you let your body recover!"
954814,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 21:48:00,11391,"  This will move a sled like a twig!  Regional police then im not sure what they do from there?  Perhaps theyll show up here soon?  MNR and MOE are intertwined up here and im sure it goes through them as well.  As for the sled there is def no way to recover it as per the conditions. This isnt an area with alot of ice incidents like down south so I dont believe theyde have a safe way to remove it  When i did fire and rescue and a boat anchored in the rapids and went down it was never removed. 70,000 bass boat too.  You even see old motors etc in the main channel on bottom"

954879,chris.brock,2016-01-26 02:13:00,4053,"Taken a half hour ago on the US side    Lol chris  If I remember correctly you owe me a story???  Ok, I'll take some of the idiot weight off of you.  A buddy and me had an absolute perfect day sledding in Hali. Late in the day, I was showing off, running open water on Kushog and I didn't make it. I hit a stump earlier in the day and it opened a hole in the belly pan, allowing water to spray onto my clutch.  Luckily, the water was shallow and I could dive under to get a rope around the ski and we dragged the sled out.  After an hour of swimming and screwing around, I was frozen and needed to warm up immediately, the sun was down and it was -15.  Funny, we went to the Ox Narrows bar, when I walked in, a guy in the back said ""you wet?"" Me ""yeah"". He yells to the bar tender, ""Mabel, we've got a wet one here!""  Mabel in a raspy voice ""GET DOWN TO THE BASEMENT, STRIP OFF, PUT YOUR crap IN THE DRYER, GRAB THE HOUSE COAT, COME BACK UP!"" like she's seen it dozens of times before .Drinking hot chocolate at Ox Narrows in a house coat was actually a blast.  I didn't feel normal and warm until 3 days later.  It's all funny, but it's really easy to die when on the ice. I'm a bit older than you Rick and would say err on the side of caution.  ."
954887,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 02:27:00,11391,Damn dood thats gnarly!  See in the pic how close the US folk are from the edge?

955052,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 02:23:00,11391," Kinda scary at first I thought the pain was in my lung  Turns out its the muscle under the chest bone.  Hurts like heck but oh well?  Mentally im still a lil shook, but ill be fine!"
955053,chris.brock,2016-01-27 02:32:00,4053, Hurts like heck but oh well    Would you feel better if I sent you some flowers?

955062,HTHM,2016-01-27 03:36:00,4082,So you go commando?! Talk about shrinkage....
955065,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 03:49:00,11391,???
955083,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 11:10:00,8243,Going into water over your plums at 0C is more than your average shrinkage. If you cough you might get a mouth full of nuts.
955087,leaf4,2016-01-27 13:50:00,2466, Some people do that without going in 0c!  Badum tssss  Haha terrible joke I know
954672,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 23:50:00,11391,"Few more tips i forgot.  Keep your phone somewhere else. Once its dunked your not calling for help. Even if your phone works good luck dialing a number as your hands are 95% useless.  Once out, spider crawl to a safe location.  And if you have a float suit(you should if you ice fish rivers or other sketchy area)  Put it on and go to your local swimming pool to learn how it feels and how to menuever"
954700,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-25 03:01:00,956,Glad you were able to recover after that incident Rick.  This site to me is all about learning and your story could very well help one of us one day if we are ever in the same situation.
954707,Joey,2016-01-25 04:10:00,9122,"Wow, that is brutal, I'm so glad you made it out okay.   Be safe my friend!!!!!"
954710,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 04:37:00,8243,"I just lost a fairly long reply. Readers digest version. I don't have a line up of people that want to be my friend so I can't afford to lose anymore Rick. Ice fishing alone? What are you stupid? Leave that wonderful young woman with a dozen little Ricks to raise on her own and I'm coming up there, dig you up and kill you all over again.  JD  I don't have auto save here anymore since new laptop Windows 10, any tips guys? Using Explorer, Windows 10, second version."
954712,HTHM,2016-01-25 04:49:00,4082,We're still on for lunch in the early summer I hope. I'm not doing that drive without some social benefit. Glad to hear you are OK.
954717,wormdunker,2016-01-25 08:22:00,1711,"I wish you a speedy recovery & thanx for the safety tips.  We'll all learn from your report.  I'm purchasing new safety ice picks TODAY!  I presently have a brand new pair I bought 4 years ago.  They are junk!  They're the type that the pointed  end sticks into the other pick.  Extremely difficult to pull them apart.  I can't imagine how difficult it would be to separate them in an emergency situation.  I'm searching for the ones that are retractable - like ""spring loaded"". Another tip guys.  Carry a pealess (Fox) whistle with you!  My whistle is tied to my floater suit AT ALL TIMES!!  When in my boat I have at least 2 whistles.  1 is secured to my PFD, the other 1 is tied to my tackle bag which is located right at my feet.  A bit of a hijack, but, I'm sure others will appreciate some safety tips."
954724,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 08:54:00,8243,"We used to tie 5"" spikes on a string, run the string in your coat and the spikes went into your pocket. I have never seen ice picks. If you have a large enough inflatable PFD I guess you can wear it over your coat if you don't have a survival suit. For the avid ice guy I would say a survival suit is a must have, especially if fishing solo. I'm surprised the Gov. hasn't mandated certain safety equipment must be worn or available to go out on the ice. As well a minimum thickness of ice for walking or using a machine. We must have certain safety items for boating why not ice fishing? I know myself for the few times every few years I go out on the ice I would not invest in a survival suit. I saw a show on a fishing show where they were testing various survival suits, some were basically a coffin and the best was were the survivor lasted 20 minutes or so before the effects of hypothermia started to set in and that was because of water on the face thrashing about.  All very good tips. And you are not stupid Rick, I was angry with you for not using you noggin."
954725,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 10:59:00,11391,Thanks OI?
954726,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 10:59:00,11391,Absolutely!
954727,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 11:10:00,11391,"And OI, I was chatting with a bud earlier about float suits.  Spend money and get the best you can get. One quality suit should last a darn long time.  Mines not a typical suit. Its from fire a rescue and the suits are worth at least 3 grand or more.  Also, like I mentioned earlier, at least I think I did? Lol  Go to your local pool and practise. Because if youve never gone through before and you come up belly first I garauntee youll panic, and thats bad.  The key is to use an arm and a leg to rotate to your belly(trust me it feels weird at first, like being in a sumo wrestler costume lol). Once in your belly, you should be out in 30 seconds.  Spider crawl to safety. If ya have a hood, use it and turn your head against the wind.  Get dry asap and get warm liquids asap.  Its gonna hurt, especially your hands as they circulate blood. Im serious here. Its about 5-10 minutes of excruciating pain. If ya ever froze your toes and they hurt when you unthaw, yeah its like that x100 lol."
954728,wormdunker,2016-01-25 11:50:00,1711,"All good points Rick thanx.  I do have a question?  ""Unthaw""??  If you freeze a chunk of meat, it is frozen hard - RIGHT. If you thaw that piece of meat it is soft - Right?  So if you ""unthaw"" that hunk of meat?  What are you actually doing?  Think about it.  Let me know what you come up with.  LOL! Sorry, I got too much time on my hands!  Waiting to go ice fishing."
954730,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 12:00:00,11391,"Lol i dont mean frozen or unthaw in the literal sense???  Im just talking about restricted blood circulation, and as you get back to normal body temp. And circulation increases its very painful"
954733,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 12:48:00,8243,http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-a-Fall-Through-Ice  The above is a good set of rules if you have not had the experience of going through. I did once while walking the Bay of Quinte. Lucky for me it was in 6 feet of water. If it was any deeper I guarantee more panic would have set in and I would be a gonner. My pals thought it to be humorous for some reason.
954743,wormdunker,2016-01-25 13:51:00,1711,With friends like that - you don't need any enemies!
954747,AKRISONER,2016-01-25 14:43:00,5558,unreal dude glad you are ok.  Also glad to hear this didnt happen because of your stupidity like all of the dummies falling through simcoe!  gear can be replaced man no big deal!
954748,JoshS,2016-01-25 14:57:00,729,Wow! Glad you are ok. Sobering story. Don't let the gear get to you... you're alive. Stay Safe.
954778,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 18:36:00,8243,"Rick said ""Spend money and get the best you can get. One quality suit should last a darn long time.""  In theory it should last a lifetime as long as I stop gaining this belly I found after the holidays. Like I said after watching that test of survival suits they are not all created equally."
954780,highdrifter,2016-01-25 18:41:00,2534,"Wow man glad to hear you're safe..  You've got a wife and kids that need you!!  For the record, you sir have one hell of an understanding old lady!!"
954786,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 19:20:00,11391," And HD, my wife is used to my lifestyle lol. Just another story to tell  Only time she was really worried is when I went camping for a weekend and we lost buddies boat and got stranded on an island for 8 days(crazy story)"
954788,chris.brock,2016-01-25 19:38:00,4053,"No pictures, it didn't happen.  If you end up under the ice and downstream of where you broke through, you're done.  Stuff is just stuff and can be replaced. Your family needs you around man, be careful."
954799,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 21:07:00,11391,Taken a half hour ago on the US side    Lol chris?  If I remember correctly you owe me a story???
954800,highdrifter,2016-01-25 21:07:00,2534,"so what happens next?!  Are you going to try to recover your sled?  Are you legally obligated to notify the authorities otherwise??  If you have comprehensive insurance, you'd have to file a police report in order to claim for your sled.. so if you're not going to make a claim, do you just leave it there?  Some inquiring minds would like to know!"
954801,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 21:15:00,11391, No way to recover it now.
954802,highdrifter,2016-01-25 21:18:00,2534,Dude..  It'd have sunk like a stone!  She ain't going nowheres..  Think you ought to notify someone.  You can't just leave it there!! LOL
954805,manitoubass2,2016-01-25 21:24:00,11391,   Oh itll move trust me. And yes its been reported
954570,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 02:55:00,11391,"Straight up.  The wife is gonna give birth anytime now.  Im exhuasted with false labour.  The kiddos and wife headed off to town today so I went for a drive. Seen 3 or 4 fishing the river.  Thats it, my ice gear isnt even ready but im determined to head out for abit and just have fun. Even if its for two hours(on the river)  Lotsa holes drilled, checked em out. 7 to 8""  Perfect....  Brought out he old ski doo and all my gear. Drilled 6 or 7 holes.  (Weather had changed drastically from in the -30's to about -4ish)  I set up and drilled my last hole. The ice drops, thats normal on the river.  Then boom!  Im down, in the water. Sled down, tackle down, gopro, whatever else is gone.  About a 10 foot hole im guessing just collapsed.  Thank god I was wearing a floater suit and had my spikes.  I got out quickly(surprising giving the currerent) talk about a mind f...  Everything is gone and I think my season is done. Im guessing about 8 grand in gear gone(dont really care im alive)  The floater suit and spikes saved my life. I never even wet a line(barely)  Be safe people. Even 8"" wasnt safe in this instance.  Im ok. Swallowed a little water and probably hit the er tomorrow if needed.  Be safe my friends...  Very very safe"
954572,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-24 03:09:00,10439,"Damn dude!!! Glad yer OK!!!! Things can be replaced, lives can't. Should be able to get the sled back I would think.  I hate running rivers even here in the Arctic. Always worry about something like that happening."

954581,GBW,2016-01-24 05:18:00,8460,"Like I said earlier today when you told me, DAMN lucky to be alive! As for the gear, you never know some of the people you know and fish with there may snag the odd item or two and show up and drop them off at home (with luck)"
954582,adempsey,2016-01-24 05:29:00,1498,"Glad you're OK.   Is it typical to ice fish a river?  Never done it, I assumed it was too dangerous to fish anywhere with constant current.  What are some of your typical ice fishing lures?  I might have some extras lying around."
954583,wormdunker,2016-01-24 08:33:00,1711,"Wow!  Happy to hear you are OK.  I'm glad you posted your story, I'm sure others that read this could also help them realize how dangerous it can actually be.  Good luck while you recover."
954587,Big Cliff,2016-01-24 13:05:00,6899,"OMG my heart just about stopped with the thought of it! I am so glad you made it out safe, all I can think about is what would it have done to your wife and kids if you hadn't! Just goes to show that even someone with your skills and experience can get into trouble, thankfully you had the equipment necessary to survive it!  I hope you can recover some of your gear, the sled especially but as others have said ""gear can be replaced"".  Glad you are still with us!"
954588,davey buoy,2016-01-24 13:14:00,5505,"Holy cow Rick,glad you are here to tell the story. IMO,ice fishing rivers,no can do.I hope you can get some of your stuff back come spring.Agreed,maybe stay off the river this year.Seems you have a lot of good dry land things to do very shortly.Hope the little one comes real soon,good luck !!!!"
954593,woodenboater,2016-01-24 14:00:00,2277,"holy crap, glad you're here to post this warning. Good on you for having the foresight to wear the floater suit and bring spikes. I'll bet your wife gave you an earful after she hugged you long and close.  The ice that truly scares the hell out of me is river ice. Lakes usually don't have much current but river ice ? the river is always smoking downstream.  stay safe everyone"
954594,Ralph Field,2016-01-24 14:06:00,1018,"Glad you had spikes and a floater suit, by posting this you have reminded others of the necessities needed when venturing out on the ice."

954601,huzzsaba,2016-01-24 15:05:00,884,Glad you are safe! Hope that was the worst of it and there is no need to go to the hospital except for the great news of the baby!
954611,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 17:28:00,11391,"I cant multi quote on my phone so...  Feeling good today, some pain in my right lung area but im not sure if its ny lung or a strained muscle under my chest bone? Ill be going to have it checked tomorrow at the dr.  This is a place ive been fishing alot for 7 years. Youde be amazed how thick the ice can get. Last year it was near 40"". S ary thought, this is near the spot I hold my annual family day ice fishing derby in my fallen friends name. No go this year thats for sure. I could have easily have my kids with me as well, thank god i didnt.  Ive only ice fished a few small backlakes this season so my tackle box had more in it then it would normaly have. 2 trays of useless gear for hardwater, a tray of lipless cranks, a tray of jigs, and a tray of spoons(lotsa northland buckshot jigging spoons). Also had fillet knife, compass etc in there.  Just realized now i guess my fishfinder is gone too lol.  Few things to remember folks, wear your spikes around your kneck at all times.  Ince you fall in, dont fight it or panic, take a few good breaths and flip bellyside horizontally. The goal is to be calm and get out first try(dont panic because i guarantee itll take more than one try if you do)  Keep an extra set of clothes and towel in your vehicle.  Warn from the inside out. I know a hot shower is mighty tempting but dont do this.  Warm liquids are the best   If you have swallowed water or feel really cold or your heart rate isnt normal call an ambulance or 911 immediately.  And wear your damn float suits! I know they are expensive but the cost is little compared to your lives.  Mentally im a little shaken, but ok.  As stated I think Im done on the hardwater for the year  And thanks for all the kind words and to GBW and chris brock for the chats last night. Oh and for chris calling me an idiot! ??? classic brock! Classic"
954618,smitty55,2016-01-24 18:13:00,928,"That's wild Rick. Glad you're ok. That's quite strange as 8"" of ice will normally support a car easily. There must have been quite the air gap under the ice so that the water was no longer supporting the ice. I've ice fished the Ottawa River tons and never had a problem, even in the current areas. You know what they say about falling off a horse. I don't think you should stop ice fishing over it. If it's something you enjoy that much then go for it, just make sure of ice conditions.  Cheers"
954619,manitoubass2,2016-01-24 18:16:00,11391,"Drastic change in weather and possibly the water levels had dropped??? Or increased?
