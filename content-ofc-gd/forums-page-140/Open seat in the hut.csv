I will be there at 8 / 8;15 untill about 2 or 3. All I ask from you is bring your own rod, or whatever you fish with, and a chair. Its a tent style shelter. If anybody wants to kill a couple hrs, lets go."

I would love to take you up on the offer sometime down the road as I'm off to physio in an hour to get my back in line so this week isn't doable. Where is Shades Mill Tender52?  Thanks for the kind gesture, someone I'm sure will join you for sure.  Johnny D"
