954647,icefisherman,2016-01-24 21:29:00,952,"Was doing few things around the Grizzly today and at one point had to do some work under the plastic cover at the front where the battery is....noticed a black tube (see picture) with loose end not connected to anything. Not sure if I disconnected it by mistake, or it was like that before me opening the cover. Any idea where the end has to connect to? Or does it stay unplugged? What is the purpose of this tube? Hope Grizzly owners have seen the tube and know what to do with it.    Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
954648,lakerguy,2016-01-24 21:38:00,224,Fuel tank vent tube possibly Can't see the pic on my iPad for some reason
954651,Joeytier,2016-01-24 21:58:00,3990,Looks like a vent tube from the tank...can't you follow it and see where it goes?
954657,icefisherman,2016-01-24 22:12:00,952,"It is jammed in there, hard to see anything in there without dismantling it all....can't see the other end of it....and can't find any place it might be connecting to....maybe it is a vent tube and should leave it as is?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
954660,Joeytier,2016-01-24 22:19:00,3990,Seems like it to me.
954671,mr blizzard,2016-01-24 23:47:00,1589,"Have a Polaris but have a similar tube, vent tube  Look at the inside opening, if it were attached to something u should see some kind of molding impression on what it fit over if not gas er up and giver,,,,oh ya congrats on your milestone posting,,,a thousand young"
954680,icefisherman,2016-01-25 01:14:00,952,"Thanks Mr. Blizzard,  didn't even notice the 1,000th post until you mentioned it. Thanks for all replies guys it seems vent tube is the common answer, so I'll just leave it where it is.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
954691,Fisherman,2016-01-25 01:42:00,7201,"Take a sniff, you'll know if it's the gas tank vent tube.  could also be the front differential vent tube."
954702,vance,2016-01-25 03:15:00,719,"My guess is a battery vent tube or a carb drain tube,but definitely a drain of some sort .  vance"
954718,wormdunker,2016-01-25 08:28:00,1711,My Polaris 500 had a few (maybe 3) vent tubes hanging down at various locations.  So I'm thinking vent tube on yours as well.  How do you like the 700 Grizz?  If I buy a newer machine I'm definitely thinking Yammy!  700 Grizz!!
954767,jimmer,2016-01-25 17:20:00,2730,That end is too clean to look like it was attached to something. Probably a vent tube like others have said.
954809,icefisherman,2016-01-25 21:37:00,952,"Didn't smell like anything, didn't have sign of been connected to anything so I just left it alone in there and closed the plastic cover.  Wormdunker,  Love the Grizzly. Still learning it as you can tell. Finishing installing various ice fishing accessories, etc. Can't wait to put it to the first real ice fishing test.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
954907,mr blizzard,2016-01-26 04:08:00,1589,"drive it like u stole it u will be fine but it does not hurt to ask questions, thats how we all continue to learn God only knows I have learned so much from the members of this board. I have had a polaris atv that we bought from a farmer just outside of tobermory , and i am still noticing new things on it, after 6 years, alot of great people on here, that is why this is the only board i am on"
954910,ch312,2016-01-26 07:34:00,1590,"Icefisherman, that's one of the vents you have on the Grizzly and there should be a few more slid through little plastic loops on the back of the pod around where the clear line is in your pic. You should have more near the air box and another on the right side of the tank. What year?  Believe it or not, but there are 6 vent lines on the Grizz that should be kept clear and above water, 7 if you have EPS:  -Power steering unit -Front Differential -Electric fan -Radiator overflow bottle -Gas tank -Throttle body -Rear differential   When I added snorkels to my 700 I extended all of these lines to the end of the snorkels to be sure nothing would suck water. She was full of water 2 times before I finally decided to add the snorkels.   Edit: Forgot to add that I believe in 09 they switched to rubber bellows on the EPS. Too much moisture getting into the EPS units through the vent lines."
954956,icefisherman,2016-01-26 15:32:00,952,"Thanks ch312. Learning something everyday from kind replies like yours and others above. It is 2010 Grizzly 700 FI EPS Camo version. So I guess I do have somewhere 7 (or 6 more) of those vent lines...waooo...lot of venting ha ha. By the way I'll be posting shortly another thread regarding tires for the same machine.... lots and lots to learn. Never had ATV before.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
