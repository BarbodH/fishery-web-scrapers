954793,NAW,2016-01-25 20:15:00,4022,"I always have my spud bar around my wrist.  It's not going to make my sink to the bottom faster...  I wear a floater suite, almost 100% of the time.  My spud is custom designed.  1"" x 3"" 4140PH plate welded to 1"" DOM tube, with a T-handle.  Knurled for grip.  After some trial and error with the exact angle to sharpen the tip, I heat treated the tip as hard as I could get it.  I only have to sharpen it once every few years now.  Works like a charm!  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=59871&hl=%2Bbud+%2Bthe+%2Bspud  The link was before I added a rope through the handle, with a loop to fit over my wrist.  Nothing tight.  Just there in case it slips out of my hand while chipping a hole."
954845,GBW,2016-01-25 23:47:00,8460," As for the wrist part, I would have enough room to flick my hand out in a moment and I too wear a float suit every time. It keeps me warm too... Going to either buy or make one later this week depending on the cost to make one like Dave said. It's just a spike, not to pry ever. I have my gas auger in the sled to make holes I'm just checking for ice thickness for safety is all."

954899,NAW,2016-01-26 03:33:00,4022,Pretty hard to chip step your way to a spot swinging an axe..  One easy chip with a good spud pole and you penetrate easily an inch if not 2 of ice..  That's what spud poles where invented for.  An axe is no where near as ergonomically designed.

You can drill a hole through the top end (side to side) and tie a rope loop through it to put around your wrist. Don't want it shooting through to the bottom."

For the short term till I get a new one Dave has the answer so I can get out ASAP. Look out goggles and grinder here I come! Too bad I gave away the T bar's I had as they would have been easy to grind to a nice T point and been about the same weight... Oh well...

I have dealt with the HH in Bobcaygeon  for many things, most recently an outdoor wood burning stove. Called them on a Monday from my home here in Oshawa after finding the item on their website. They had NONE in store...but said they would get it for me. They had it waiting for me in there store, fully assembled, at no extra cost... when I came up the following weekend. Not all stores or people are created equal. If your serious give the caygeon store a call. My experience is they will go that extra mile to help you out."
954714,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 05:06:00,8243,"A 1"" bar is going to be seriously heavy. 3/4"" is all you need. Any Mom and Pop welding shop will make you a bar and chisel together cheaply. I wouldn't expect to pay more than 50 bucks to weld a bar to a 3"" by 5"" chisel if you supply the material. To give you an idea for weight it's simple a cubic inch of steel weighs .920 pounds. on average."

954729,fishindevil,2016-01-25 11:57:00,6254,yes they will been dealing with them for years and they are more than happy to get whatever you need !!!! I mean the home hardware in bobcaygeon....
