955330,msp,2016-01-29 14:18:00,1336,"So, I am finally going to pull the trigger and purchase a GPS/fish finder combo unit. I am getting some conflicting information about the chips associated with the GPS. My questions are...... What is the best chip to purchase that will give me as much information possible. I would like to get as many inland Canadian lakes as possible as well as some of the Great lakes.( Ontario and Erie ) Do I need two chips or can I get all the info on one chip. Do I need to download additional information or is it just plug and play ?  Also, does anyone have experience with the Lowrance chirp units ?  Hopefully some experts can provide some direction  Thanks,"
955342,porkpie,2016-01-29 14:58:00,2521,"They have a chip now that you can go online to navionics and download whatever areas you want up to I believe 4 gigs.  It includes a year subscription so you can modify your choices to figure out what works best for you, as well as get current updates.  That's the way I'd go if I was buying now.  As it stands I have hotmaps and gold and carry 2 cards, but don't need everything that is on both cards.  I have a raymarine with chirp.  I'm pretty satisfied with it, but I don't really have much to compare it to other than my old lower end humminbird (which was still pretty good).  I don't think the chirp hurts anything, but if your looking at new I'd wait for the new lowrance elite 7ti.  It should retail around $1100 and have side and down imaging, GPS, touch screen and chirp sonar.  If you don't want side imaging it will be a little less with just a standard chirp transducer.  If I ""find"" a grand this summer somehow, I might get one just for side imaging.  Good luck."
955343,JoshS,2016-01-29 15:00:00,729,I think you want the navionics plus chip. You can download the areas you need.
955352,G.mech,2016-01-29 16:04:00,830,x2 on the Navionics +.  Once I got that I got rid of everything else.  You can basically download all of Ontario and still have room left...
955356,msp,2016-01-29 16:20:00,1336,Is it a pain in the a$$ to download maps for a computer illiterate like me ?
955361,porkpie,2016-01-29 17:17:00,2521,My buddy got one last summer.  He isn't what I'd call a tech wizard by any stretch and he seemed to have no problems.  Your mileage may vary.
955368,G.mech,2016-01-29 17:34:00,830,It's actually quite easy and there's lots of videos on You-Tube if you need help.  Here's a link for a very good one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CEPmK0jmKM
