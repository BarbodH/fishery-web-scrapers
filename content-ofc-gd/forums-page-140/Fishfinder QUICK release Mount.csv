Anyone have an Elite 7 that they used some kind of Quick release mount? Been looking at the RAM ones and they have an adapter that snaps right in on the Elite 5 but the Elite 7 uses a gimbal type bracket mount!  Thanks, Mike "

Comes off fairly quick when you unscrew it,  it just pops off the ball, can also take it off the ball mounted to the boat and leave the arm attached to the graph, have my HDS mounted the same on the dash but with the bigger ram mount  Cheapest I found when I looked http://www.gpscity.ca/ram-mount-rectangular-plate-short-surface-mount-ram-111u-b.html     "
