954936,Fish Farmer,2016-01-26 13:26:00,2234,"Send us a report Dave - please!  I've decided against my Tuesday trip.  Gonna be 30 km wind.  I'll wait a few days for calmer weather.  Good luck! Don't rush Brian, Buddy and myself ended the day with 3 keepers and 1 Smelt. Lots of Dinks to be had if you're into 4"" Perch. We walked out just east of Bolster, Must have drilled 50 holes looking. Lots of people out but all reported the same all small fish. Was brutal walking out till we got to smooth ice 200 yards of shove ice was hard to travel on, dumped my sled I don't know how many times, lost all the water in our minnow pail. Was hard on the legs,if you fell could be a hazard. Funny thing, 2 young guys just set up beside us and was just dropping his line down and WAM, Weight on a Berkley scale 12 LB. Walleye  That was the only fish they caught all day. We had enough and left around 3pm. to fight that crazy Toronto traffic. I think I'm going to stick with St. Williams. Called my other buddy on Erie and he had 10 big JUMBOS at noon and 1 Pike. Brian you can give me a call at my home # pm. sent"
954967,misfish,2016-01-26 16:44:00,29133,"It,s a crap shoot some days Dave. Did you say smelt? Oh a good feed of those would of been nice ehbye.  I think I had some below me on sunday, but was more interested in the whities. I,ll be ready for them next time.  I didn't get a PM btw,"
954976,Headhunter,2016-01-26 18:13:00,5703,Mmmmmmm.... smelt!!!! My favorite! Pike bait that is! LOL HH

955101,Fish Farmer,2016-01-27 15:29:00,2234,"I actually talked to the bylaw guy who issues tickets and he told me I was just lucky that I never got a ticket before this. The bylaw was created in 2012 so there has been plenty of time to post signs but like I told them "" sounds like something to trap tourists"".. the ones who can afford it will have the place to themselves.. they alone won't be able to support the businesses since they aren't there in the winter. I will go to long point where they actually invite you to come fish.. no parking areas are well marked... rotten Ronnies will get my cash.. You're right Phil, I think it'll be awhile before I get back to Simcoe, they win we lose. One good thing about it I don't have to go through that Toronto Traffic."
955114,Sinker,2016-01-27 16:28:00,8692,"Parking at simcoe isn't cheap either, and many people are getting the same tickets. Town of georgina will never see me again.  S."
955146,porkpie,2016-01-27 20:42:00,2521,"Better to go to Beaverton.  No tickets and good fishing.  Georgina can kiss my $&@"", I won't launch to hunt, fish or icefish out of there again, and that's after being a south end simcoe guy for 25 years.  It's bad enough with the parking situation, but now they want $16 to launch your boat at launches that are dirt, unmaintained, weed choked, and had been free for as long as I can remember.  I could see it if they charged $5 or so, but $16 for a garbage launch is crooked .  They can go pound!"
955152,pics,2016-01-27 21:37:00,1268,With the weather warming up we might have to head waayyy north to fish.. wow ..
954509,misfish,2016-01-23 18:12:00,29133,"Me bud and I hit Lady Simcoe for a few hours this morning. There was no way we were heading to the circus grounds, so we hit a quiet little joint.  Village for two. Chip chip, step he did, and did it well I must say.Ice was 3-4 inches, which surprised us, as it,s been covered now for 6 days. Make our way out and decide were good where we were for the first time out. Couple old guys not pushing thier limits anymore.  Some small herring and dink perch and smelts. Not alot though.  Red blob comes in view, smacks the small half and half and it,s a nice slob perch. Quick picture and back she went.  All and all, happy to get out, breath some fresh winter air.  Few pics to keep those that have ice o litice.  Tradition, praying to the fish gods. Most times, it works.        Listening to some Pink Floyd    What keeps us going back    Stay safe out there all. Chip chip step.    "
954515,Rizzo,2016-01-23 18:26:00,4754,nicely done! I hit the ice for a few hours this morning as well. Guelph Lake has around 7 inches of ice where we were. Caught a pike and a few perch came to visit as well. Kinda slow out there but fun to get out
954517,Big Cliff,2016-01-23 18:37:00,6899,"Friend was out on Sturgeon last three days. First two days where we normally see perch and he didn't get a single bite. 5-7"" of ice in a protected bay.  Yesterday out in front of our place for about an hour, 4-5"" of ice, one small walleye in the slot but out of season so back it went, missed one more hit.  Thinking I might head up to Tim Hale's for a week day first week of Feb. and see if the perch are biting."
954524,wormdunker,2016-01-23 19:19:00,1711,I'm with you Cliff.  Getting to old for a long walk.  I'm booking an outfitter for Tuesday.  Hopefully have a good report.
954526,Terry,2016-01-23 19:41:00,14456,"it was great to get on simcoe    that picture does not do that fish justice, it was bigger then it looks there"

954532,Acountdeleted,2016-01-23 20:22:00,2562,"Great  post. I'll  be  out  on  Simcoe tomorrow. Looks  great  out  there.  Is the ice  safe  on  Guelph  Lake? I know  the  park  staff  say  to keep  off, but  back  when  they  rented  huts  I  was  out  every  year."
954537,porkpie,2016-01-23 21:24:00,2521,"If you go out on Guelph lake you are trespassing.  They no longer rent huts and no longer ""allow"" ice fishing.  Not to say people don't do it, and I'm not sure how strictly its enforced, but you should be aware before you head out."
954538,ketchenany,2016-01-23 22:18:00,3229,You should be smiling B! You have to Lew look nice fish. Dinner?
954547,misfish,2016-01-23 23:22:00,29133,"You should be smiling B! You have to Lew look nice fish. Dinner?  Not for dinner bud. Was so slow, I knew it would be a solo feed. Not fair to the others that avoided to join  her in the frying pan. Next time.  BTW, I was smiling.She was a hawg. I was screaming like a school girl."
954549,NAW,2016-01-23 23:50:00,4022,I have to admit. I drooled on my phone a bit when I looked at these pics!!  I'm going to head out next weekend for sure Saturday and Sunday.  Maybe even one morning during the week if I can clear my schedule
954553,Rustic-Fisher,2016-01-24 00:23:00,826,Nice work ! That perch sure is a Pig !!!!!! That 4th pic is pretty cool also.
954554,Gallie,2016-01-24 00:31:00,1215,Nice perch brian! Thanks for the report
954564,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-24 01:58:00,10439,"Got out on my lake for a little fishin' finally today too. Had 2 hits landed one small laker and that was it. Ice was only about 36"" thick though."
954591,davey buoy,2016-01-24 13:52:00,5505,"Good going guys,we had 4"" where we were.Upon heading out we hit 2"" ,turned around till last drilled hole.Caught well over a hundred perch,but only 16 in the 10""-12"" size. Still a fun day.Funny,not one previous track out,by 10am we had a small city around us lol."
954595,solopaddler,2016-01-24 14:07:00,8605,"Looks like fun Brian, nice to see someone's getting out!"
954596,mr blizzard,2016-01-24 14:23:00,1589,"Wait a go Brian, glad to see u guys getting out on some safe ice Nice catch , used to really enjoy the perch fishing, tasty little critters"

954617,misfish,2016-01-24 17:53:00,29133,"Thanks guys.  Dave, Im sure you will be happy, as the reports from that side have been very good,  Have a good,n bud."

954734,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 12:58:00,8243,"Good on you Brian. Wormdunker and I are in negotiations for a trip. It will be the second time out on the ice in 14 years, that is if he McGivers me a hut with a 3 piece bath by the time we go."
954908,pics,2016-01-26 04:26:00,1268,I might have to venture up to Simcoe soon.. my spot in Georgian Bay is toast.. this is the first year that I've gotten a ticket for parking at the side of the road.. no signs to indicate no parking. I went to the Township office to pay them and to give them a piece of my mind and to tell them I won't spend another penny in their municipality. The fishing sucked too.. I guess the lake is reserved for those that can afford to live on it...
954922,wormdunker,2016-01-26 12:00:00,1711,The parking issue sux!  I'll book an outfitter & park for free in his lot.  $30.00 parking ticket will pay for part of the outfitter's fee.

I guess the lake is reserved for those that can afford to live on it...  This actually really bothers me. For smaller communities along GB and places further up north, I know for a fact the local businesses appreciate any extra business that comes through. The extra money that comes in from us fishin' folk can really help some of the local stores and businesses get through the down months over the winter.  When I hear of someones car getting tagged like this, especially when there are no signs posted, it tells me that all of that means nothing in relation to the municipality making another $30 off of a ticket.  I don't blame you for not going back. If they are going to bite the hand that feeds them, the results are their own fault."
