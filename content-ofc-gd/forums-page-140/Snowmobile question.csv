954756,jimmer,2016-01-25 15:35:00,2730,"Hey Guys I have an 84 Excell 3 Yamaha. It always seemed to run well, however, seems to have some problem that I can't figure out. If I have it up on a block it will run like stink, but as soon as I drop it and put my weight on it won't move and kind of bogs down throwing lots of smoke out (maybe belt). Starts fine and idles fine. Any ideas????? Thanks, jimmer"
954765,Sandbag,2016-01-25 16:21:00,533,If it is only happening under load (as it appears to be) I would check the belt for sure and then move on to the Primary and Secondary clutch needing serviced.  Let us know how it works out. Good luck Cheers  Craig
954769,Rod Caster,2016-01-25 17:25:00,5784,"can you smell burning rubber? That should be very distinct. If not, it's not the belt slipping.  Maybe your fuel is just too rich?? My tundra smokes like a hooore if my fuel mix is too rich."
954770,chris.brock,2016-01-25 17:32:00,4053,"I would start with the simple stuff first, new NGK plugs and fresh gas if you haven't already. I had an 82 Excel. Check to see the choke isn't stuck open because the cable is out of place. Sounds rich like Chad mentioned."
954779,Sinker,2016-01-25 18:37:00,8692,"You have oil in the chain case?  Ever had the drive shaft bearings done?  Could just be a belt, but seems fishy to me.  S."
954789,jimmer,2016-01-25 19:53:00,2730,I did all that stuff Chris. It runs fine until I put a load on it to move.  I had the drive shaft out Sinker and the bearings were fine.  I will look into the rich setting though.
954792,chris.brock,2016-01-25 20:15:00,4053,"Post a pic of the belt and clutches if you can. If the belt is worn and thin, it will sit low in the secondary and it will be like trying to start off in tall gear, like trying to pull away from a stop sign in your car in 4th gear sort of thing."
954914,Big Cliff,2016-01-26 09:57:00,6899,Are you sure your track isn't binding on something when you set it down? If it runs fine up on a block but not when it is sitting on the track???????
954944,jimmer,2016-01-26 14:01:00,2730,"The belt is sitting low in the secondary clutch. Should it be level with the top edge? I will check the track Cliff. Thanks guys, I appreciate the input."
