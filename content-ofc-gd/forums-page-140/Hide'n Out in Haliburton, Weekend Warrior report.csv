954960,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 15:46:00,11391,"Beeeotch  There, said it. Now put up your dukes???  Looks like an awesome place chris!!!!  I bet a great time was had!"
954999,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-26 21:55:00,8243,"I love your little piece of Heaven there Chris Brock. You are going to have die hard hard water guys stealthily following you to your spot that has ice AND FISH.  I have driven and owned Jeeps for a long time. YJ's, Wrangler, TJ's. Even though not mine but my pal even had an old post war Willys I helped destroy. The best advice I can give you to keep that Jeep running on the road, do not go off road, at least too much. Off road is fun but expensive. If there was something to break under the body I broke it. One day we were wondering what that noise was coming from below until I needed brakes, the noise was dragging a section of a brake caliper held only by the hydraulic hose, both fronts. All of the suspension components and hardware are nowhere the quality of the same components of years gone by. I hope you get the same enjoyment out of your Jeep as I did all 4 of mine. Get that top off, doors off and fold down the wind screen and you are as close to riding a bike down the road as you can. Do the windshields still fold down?"
955000,chris.brock,2016-01-26 22:10:00,4053,"I don't think I'll be doing any serious off roading any time soon OI.  I couldn't handle the branches scratching the paint and plastic fenders too.  Yeah, the windshields still fold down. Looking forward to it,as soon as the temperature hits 15 degrees, the top is coming off for a cruise."
955001,4x4bassin,2016-01-26 22:24:00,1025,"Nice report Chris , lets go wheelin !!! After the first scratch its easy"
955019,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-26 23:40:00,8243,"Top down doors off, you can't get that feeling in any other car, well maybe a MGA but you don't see too many of them. Don't forget to crank the Supertramp. Don't forget to throw a pair of sweats and a jacket in the back, sun goes down pants go on."
955063,Steelheadphycho,2016-01-27 03:46:00,470,That is incorrect bob........
955068,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 03:53:00,11391,???
955078,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 05:17:00,8243,"We have that 1 window on the lake side 14 feet up, I use a leaf blower to clean it.  Pants come off as easy as they went on!"
954773,chris.brock,2016-01-25 18:08:00,4053,"  I planned to stay with the family Saturday. It was tough to see my friends out on the ice with the nice sunshine.  Drinkin' with my bud.    The skies were clear for the Wolf Moon. It's the dead of winter but it feels like it won't be long until Maple sap is flowing.    First day on the ice for me, January 24th, ouch. It was like an itch I had finally scratched.     Harry Balz and the Cisco Kid.    It was the first time she was shifted into 4 wd. I did get stuck and had to cut down a poplar tree to get out    Damn, I can't wait until the next trip up there."
954777,Sinker,2016-01-25 18:34:00,8692,Nice. You got the Jeep stuck?? Say whaaaaa?  How was the ice?  S.
954782,Acountdeleted,2016-01-25 18:47:00,2562,Wow. Nice haul. Looks like an awesome day to be out.
954787,chris.brock,2016-01-25 19:28:00,4053,"Nice. You got the Jeep stuck?? Say whaaaaa?  How was the ice?  S.  Backing down the drive way I went too far to one side.  5 inches of good ice, nobody venturing out to the main lake yet though."
954794,ckewley,2016-01-25 20:20:00,699,Looks like you had a good day out as well
954810,Joeytier,2016-01-25 21:39:00,3990,"We enjoyed that beautiful full moon out at the ice bungalow this weekend, thought it was gonna make the big walleyes go crazy at midnight"
954829,Rod Caster,2016-01-25 22:16:00,5784,You have a winch yet on the jeep?
954833,misfish,2016-01-25 22:29:00,29133,"It,s a jeep, jeep jeep. LOL  Smoked herring . I,ll take two please.  Love the father/son.  Edit to ask ,as I meant too. What finder is that Chris?"
954838,chris.brock,2016-01-25 22:49:00,4053,"Helix 5 Si GPS mounted to be portable. I like it but I don't find Si and Di very useful.  No winch, I'm still in the honeymoon phase and won't do any serious off roading yet."
954840,Freshtrax,2016-01-25 22:57:00,2215,nice going!
954865,Moosebunk,2016-01-26 01:16:00,3970,You're on the ice at least a month before I'll be.  Sweet new ride Chris.  You've scratched a couple itches recently.
954867,Joeytier,2016-01-26 01:19:00,3990,What do you guys do with the herring?  The ones out of Nipissing are disgusting unless they're smoked or pickled.
954874,chris.brock,2016-01-26 01:30:00,4053,"Good to have Bunk back in town.  To be honest, Harry caught them all, me and the Cisco Kid were skunked but trying for a different species. I think Harry puts them up his bum. I'm not big on eating lakers or herring."
954880,solopaddler,2016-01-26 02:16:00,8605,"Man, the shoreline in your first pic sure looks familiar. Brings back a lot of memories..."
954885,chris.brock,2016-01-26 02:25:00,4053,"Man, the shoreline in your first pic sure looks familiar. Brings back a lot of memories...  My crappy cottage is yours, anytime you and the family want it, the only stipulation is post some pics."
954888,solopaddler,2016-01-26 02:34:00,8605," My crappy cottage is yours, anytime you and the family want it, the only stipulation is post some pics. Likewise bud. You know, but most on here don't...I pretty much grew up on that lake. Your place is very close to the cottage my uncle and dad built back when I was a kid. Really is a small world."
954890,chris.brock,2016-01-26 02:52:00,4053,There's a decent chance we crossed paths back then. Small world for sure!  
954891,solopaddler,2016-01-26 02:57:00,8605,You're going to make me tear up I think. Pretty sure we used to drag our hut out to almost the exact spot in your first pic. It's been more than 30 years for me but it feels like yesterday.
954894,chris.brock,2016-01-26 03:15:00,4053,"I know you're super busy, but get your arse back up there for a winter weekend for old times sake,  just post some pics."
954895,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 03:23:00,11391,Awesome!   Work that jeep!  I got a liberty lol. The whine of of all jeeps
954896,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 03:23:00,11391,B...
954897,chris.brock,2016-01-26 03:24:00,4053,B...  say it
954906,chris.brock,2016-01-26 04:00:00,4053, say it  didn't think so
954926,wormdunker,2016-01-26 12:28:00,1711,Your pix are awesome!  I love all the windows!  3 patio doors.  Windex cleaner company must love you!  LOL!
