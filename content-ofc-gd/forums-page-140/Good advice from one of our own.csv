But every now and then you see people use the bargain bin crap ... it never ceases to amaze me."
955346,Quickspence,2016-01-29 15:18:00,3,"Great advice and the right time of the year to be thinking of it. Do you really want a claim on your boat insurance because you cheeped on rope? That can cause so many other bad things to happen, like damage. Thanks ""All Knowing Angler"" for the great advice."
