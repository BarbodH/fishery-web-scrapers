I wouldn't be going out there on a sled at all right now but if you do, please be careful, I'm too old to be trying to rescue anyone out there but I'd have to try!"
954978,manitoubass2,2016-01-26 18:27:00,11391,"Where were you for my rescue????  Seriously though, seems alot of unsafe ice this year.  Be careful everyone!"
954979,Joey,2016-01-26 18:30:00,9122,Well that sounds scary Cliff.  I think I've given up on ice fishing this season unfortunately.  Even if we had a long cold spell I still would not feel safe out there.
954993,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-26 21:31:00,8243,"It takes a Woman to say and do the logical thing, stay off the ice. I read throughout all these ice fishing threads ""be careful"". If you are out on thin ice and don't know how thin it actually is the next time you take a step or what is there the next time the ski crosses that ice what exactly can one do besides wearing a good survival suit to be ""careful""?"

955130,Big Cliff,2016-01-27 19:09:00,6899,"And as I look out the window this afternoon there is someone on a sled pulling another sled (or a trailer couldn't tell which) right down the middle of the lake (about 3/4 of a mile from here) and another person walking along about 100 yards or so behind them. I just walked away from the window, if they get into trouble there would be nothing I could do about it."
955135,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 19:47:00,11391,I know that feeling. Brutal
955161,Big Cliff,2016-01-27 22:36:00,6899,I know that feeling. Brutal Leaves me feeling sick to my stomach! To know that someone could die out there and I can't do anything to help them is something that doesn't sit well with me! All I can do is say a prayer.
