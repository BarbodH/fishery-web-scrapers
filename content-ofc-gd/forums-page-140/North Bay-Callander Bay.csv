I'm all but finished the new hut and I'm looking for safe ice to try it out; yes I know no ice is a 100% safe. If it's a    up there, what would be a good access point and parking for my truck while we're out? I'm hoping to go out mid week, this coming week; but I've never gone out on the ice without a hut operator before and need some advice or a local that wants a free day out fishing with us?  Dan."
955440,G.mech,2016-01-30 02:01:00,830,There is a public boat launch at Main & Park streets just on the North end of Callander where you can park with good ice access.  I'm told that there is lots of ice on Callander Bay and even some vehicles going out.   Bait at Billy Bob's tackle on Lakeshore Road North Bay if there's none in Callander.

I was fishing the channel out to the main lake last weekend on about 11"", likely more now.  Slush was starting and we've had a good bit of snow since then and warm weather coming this weekend means it will likely be sled travel only."
