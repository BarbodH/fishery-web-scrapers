Working as a summer student for the DFO on an electrofishing boat, we got this in Hamilton Harbour. The current angling record was 36 lbs and this bottomed out an old 50 lbs spring scale.  Crappy picture and it's the only one I have.  "

Crappy picture and it's the only one I have.     Somewhere I have a pic of a giant carp I caught while fishing @ the Lakeview Generating station in the 80's. I caught it on my 16' steelhead rod and 4# test Ande. Had I kept it and filled in the proper paper work it would have been the all tackle world record at just over 55#'s."

955428,solopaddler,2016-01-30 00:45:00,8605,Cool pic Chris. We used to catch really giant carp all the time at Pickering too. They were always just an annoyance. Times sure have changed!
955436,bigugli,2016-01-30 01:29:00,6138,There used to be huge pigs at Ontario Placer back in the 70's.  I was a cook back when HMCS Haida was a cadet training facility. You should have seen the size of the carp rising to eat the leftover toast every  morning. We caught a couple of 4 footers on bread balls hanging off the ship's side when we dumped the toast.
