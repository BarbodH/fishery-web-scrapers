955562,Shloim,2016-01-31 14:23:00,515,I think they are likely done. The rainbow loom craze is over and they were stocking them for those. Ive stopped at a few stores and they are gone...
913611,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-04 20:01:00,937,^^^ Yup in the Arts and Crafts aisle.  Also here's the Dollarama item number #02-3048883  You can call the store to check stock and hold them for you.
913690,maxpower,2015-05-05 03:39:00,3,"Thanks for the help, Pump. I'll keep looking."
913696,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-05 05:36:00,8243,"I have a close friend that wholesales product from China to Dollar and Giant Tiger stores. Sometimes he pays less than pennies on the dollar before it hits the shelf. It isn't easy other wise everyone would be doing it. They loose shipping containers full of product regularly. He had one container show up 5 years after he paid for it. He is in Halifax and Vancouver continually looking for his containers. I flew with him to Vancouver once to look for containers, I thought it might be a free vacation, I don't think so. Not for me that's for sure. Writing a cheque for 100K makes me nervous especially knowing much of it gets lost or stolen. Then occasionally he has to pay off the head Stevedore and craneman to dig the container out that might take a few dozen lifts to get it onto a truck or railcar. Then it's time to payoff the yardmaster to get it onto or off of a railcar. I'd have an ulcer in no time.  It's mind boggling the amount of product that comes into the country everyday by ship from overseas."
914251,joeybacala,2015-05-08 01:03:00,63,"Are you kidding, I'll have to check it too. Hopefully I'm not too late."
914379,Reel Man,2015-05-09 04:50:00,80,Sweet!  Just nabbed the last 3 at the Dollarama on Queenston in Hamilton.
914676,spinnerdoc,2015-05-11 21:15:00,556,"To the OP, Thank you very much for giving us the heads up. What a steal! I picked up 6 at the heartland dollarama."
914679,davey buoy,2015-05-11 21:22:00,5505,"Not sure if I said the same,thank you so much for the heads up."
914770,wormdunker,2015-05-12 07:05:00,1711,"Thanx for the info.  I was in St. Catharines today & grabbed 4 trays at the Dollarama on Glenridge Ave., beside Cat's Caboose (wings & beer pub).  They also had packages of 3/8"" braided polypropylene rope - 50' for $3.00.  I unfortunately paid $8.99 for the exact same product 2 weeks ago.  You can never have enough rope on your boat!!"
914952,pics,2015-05-13 01:58:00,1268,I picked up 2 from the freshco plaza on Rymal in Hamilton but only after spotting a box on an upper shelf... they come 6 to a case...
914978,Reel Man,2015-05-13 09:59:00,80,"Lol, so the Mrs was going to Dollarama at Eastgate Square.  I already snagged the last 3 at the Queenston Rd location but wanted a couple more.  So she comes back with 6!  Awesome but really more than I needed now!  Now I have to go shopping for more tackle!!  Woe is me..."
915010,SirCranksalot,2015-05-13 12:33:00,3291,"i found some boxees forr $3,but they werent pllano...  ditto"
915069,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-13 18:50:00,937,I have more then enough but I'll grab extras if I see them on the shelf.
915218,maxpower,2015-05-14 18:22:00,3,"I was in London today and hit the mother lode. Anyone looking for them in the area, head to the Dundas street store - there were tons left on the shelf and above in cases."
915237,adam lancia,2015-05-14 20:55:00,234,"Anyone in Scarborough should do to the Dollarama at Scarborough Town Centre, there must be 100 on the shelf and the one I got is made by Plano."
915250,grizzlybri,2015-05-14 23:36:00,565,I looked at the Milton locations  and 2 Mississauga ones and nothing.  Just went to this one on this lead picked up some for me and another board  member
915299,wormdunker,2015-05-15 08:22:00,1711,Mine are made by Plano model 3750.
954266,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-21 02:08:00,937,Stocked up on Plano boxes from my local Dollarama again  
954267,captpierre,2016-01-21 02:13:00,2521,Thanks but then I'd have to buy more tackle ?
954272,spinnerdoc,2016-01-21 04:12:00,556,Again? Cool. I stocked up from last time.  Very good quality.  Thanks again for posting.
954286,Shloim,2016-01-21 11:50:00,515,"The have them again? They have been out of stock in TO for ages, I got a couple last time and then there were none....."
954313,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-21 15:30:00,937,They've been restocking the last few months.  I always grab when in stock.  Dollarama item number #02-3048883.  You can call some stores around you to check stock and have them hold them for you.
954318,pics,2016-01-21 16:38:00,1268,I haven't seen them in Stock . I check every time I'm in the store..
954319,AKRISONER,2016-01-21 16:41:00,5558,i need to start looking for these ASAP
954324,captpierre,2016-01-21 17:28:00,2521,Nothing here in Stouffville today Just junky ones.
954342,pics,2016-01-21 21:16:00,1268,The last time this post was active was the last time any of the stores had any stock..lol.. coincidence??. I think not.. that's the power of the Internet and why you can't give specific locations where you fish.. now if everyone can ignore this whole thing then I might be able to get a couple before they are gone..
913203,adempsey,2015-05-01 03:02:00,1498,"I picked up one of these Plano boxes from Dollarama for $3.  It's labeled as a storage box for the Rainbow Loom.  First time I've seen them there, but maybe folks already know.   Anyway, they are listed on BPS for $9.   Figured, I pass it along."
913205,irishfield,2015-05-01 03:20:00,26272,"Bought a whole stack of them back in the winter... so I could make up tackle trays out of a large box of baits I bought here last year. Want to make up a few dozen trays to give out to kids, but never seem to find the time.  And yes.. same tackle tray you'd pay $14.99 for in CTC."
913208,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-01 03:45:00,937,It even says Plano on the bottom of the tray    
913211,Bondar,2015-05-01 04:12:00,817,I need some of these thanks for the heads up
913213,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-01 04:52:00,8243,Thanks. I hope there is a Dollarama in Hamilton still.
913216,jbailey,2015-05-01 05:35:00,866,Thanks. I hope there is a Dollarama in Hamilton still.  yep they had some at the store on upper wentworth
913223,BillM,2015-05-01 11:05:00,17367,You can never have enough tackle trays!
913226,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-01 11:33:00,8243,They show a store in Jacksons square and one in the Mountain Plaza Mall on Upper James but no store on Upper Wentworth. Where is the store on Wentworth? Going to Hamilton today.

913229,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-01 11:50:00,8243,"Thanks Roy, that store didn't show on the list I Googled."
913250,craigdritchie,2015-05-01 13:34:00,1586,"If you can't find them at Dollarama, try a Michaels craft store. They normally have them in the sewing section for around $4. They sometimes have the deeper ones too, that are good for spinnerbaits."
913252,netminder,2015-05-01 13:44:00,514,"Man, what a rip off! I thought everything there was supposed to be $1-$2 lol"
913254,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-01 14:50:00,937,Some other Dollarama finds for those interested...  https://www.facebook.com/PUMPKNOWS/posts/1572734989673252
913281,adempsey,2015-05-01 17:47:00,1498,"Man, what a rip off! I thought everything there was supposed to be $1-$2 lol  Not any more.  They changed from a true Dollar store to what they are now probably 10 years ago.  Some other Dollarama finds for those interested...  https://www.facebook.com/PUMPKNOWS/posts/1572734989673252  Nice, I am going go get me some hats!!   Hopefully my local store has some. That Lunkerhunt slip bobber kit is a really good deal too."
913287,davey buoy,2015-05-01 19:03:00,5505,"I'll be checking this weekend,forgot today,and far to busy now.Thanks for the tip !"
913290,mattaw,2015-05-01 19:08:00,162,"Picked up 8 locally. I feel like I stole them. Great buy, thanks for the heads up guys!"
913380,davey buoy,2015-05-02 15:49:00,5505,"What a buy,just picked up one just in case I need it. Make a great stocking stuffer !"
913383,Dan668,2015-05-02 16:26:00,1120,"Picked up a few, thanks."
913385,leaf4,2015-05-02 16:41:00,2466,Its in the plaza across from limeridge mall tucked in the corner beside the Tim Horton's
913397,davey buoy,2015-05-02 20:04:00,5505,"A buddy just checked out 3 stores in the Aurora area,no luck."
913402,Bill Shearer,2015-05-02 20:46:00,456,I got a few last night. Dundas store still had a bunch. What a great deal! And made by Plano is irritating. Why can't we buy these everywhere for that price? Maybe Dollarama has more power than Cabelas or Bass Pro? Or maybe it just adds to the bottom line. There are few dollar stores in many parts of the US
913403,grizzlybri,2015-05-02 21:19:00,565,I checked out the one by my work and no luck
913523,Yellow Fever,2015-05-04 00:56:00,139,Couldnt find them in Kingston
913543,123chadder,2015-05-04 11:05:00,165,"i found some boxees forr $3,but they werent pllano..."
913602,maxpower,2015-05-04 19:13:00,3,"I checked out two stores and couldn't find any. Which section are they found in? Sewing and crafts?  I did find a few good fishing items though. They had 6lb Stren mono and 15lb Stren fluoro. Also found a number of their ""Tornado"" spoons, which I haven't seen in a while. They had a number of colours - no green and silver though, which seemed to be the best colour."
