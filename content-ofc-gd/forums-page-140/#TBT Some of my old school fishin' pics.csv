The biggest fish I guided during my 15 years up on the bear it the big girl. She weighed in @ 64#'s!!!! The other two were just babies in the mid 40's!!  First the babies.      And Troutzilla!!

Yep, I'm not in those pics. Buddy that got the 64#er is almost a foot taller than me and close to 100#'s heavier."
955316,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-29 04:28:00,937,Wow!  Is that common up there?
955317,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-29 04:30:00,10439,"Wow!  Is that common up there?  There's usually a 60 or two caught each year on the lake. Plenty of 30's, 40's and decent #'s of 50's too."
955319,Roy,2016-01-29 05:32:00,13728,Wow!  Is that common up there?  Not common but there are a few who are 2' taller and 200lbs heavier than Dave. Correct me if I'm wrong Dave.

This from guides I know @ the main lodge that saw and held it.   However there are fish that size and bigger in the lake. One of my long time guests has landed a 70# fish and there was an 83 pound fish caught in a net @ settlement of Deline on the lake.  Here's an article on the fish.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/deline-man-nets-38-kg-trout-1.784756      Deline man nets 38 kg trout   CBC News Posted: Jul 21, 2009 11:32 AM CT Last Updated: Jul 21, 2009 11:29 AM CT   Deline resident George Kenny netted this huge trout on July 17. The fish weighed in at 38 kilograms. ((Bruce Kenny)) A resident from Deline, N.W.T., out fishing with his son last Friday got more than he bargained for when he netted a fish that weighed approximately 38 kilograms (83 pounds). George Kenny and his son Jordon, 13, caught the huge trout while fishing near Broken Plate Creek along the Great Bear Lake. The lake is home to the biggest lake trout in the world. Kenny said his son was a bit startled when he first spotted the large trout. ""He was kind of … scared of it,"" Kenny told CBC News on Monday. ""But I told him it’s only a bit alive. It’s not going to do nothing."" Kenny said the trout was badly tangled in the net. He tried to return the fish to the water but it wouldn’t come around. So he brought it back to Deline and weighed it. Word of the large catch quickly spread through the community. People came out to see and photograph the giant fish. Kenny said he caught an even bigger trout last year but he returned that one to the water. The Deline Land Corporation plans to mount the fish, Kenny said.   "

Now i get it, ive never been a fan of the ""world record"" qualifying rules. I mean yes, be stringent and require multiple photos, witnesses and measurements, but this thought train that you basically have to drag to fish to shore freeze it and mail it somewhere is kind of dumb.  Exactly what every fisherman wants to do, take the biggest genetic power houses from the pool and execute them, its not far from the ridiculous slot limit for walleye on georgian bay...throw all the small fish back and eat all of the big ones?"
