Yesterday I got out the tools & went to work.  Here's a couple pix Manitoubass was so kind to post for me.  Thanx Rick.  Later today I'll throw a coat of paint on the bare wood.  It looks crappy.  I did the camo paint on the box 3 years ago.  I'd like to replicate it if possible.  I like the camo paint job, so I'll be able to sneak up on the  fish!  LOL!"
955128,cheaptackle,2016-01-27 18:38:00,849,Camo paint worked so well that the pictures can't even be seen....  Michael
955131,mr blizzard,2016-01-27 19:31:00,1589,x2 would like to see the design
955133,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 19:43:00,11391,Lol sorry for the delay(pregnancy related)    The other pic didnt save properly ill try again?  Friggen nice smitty!!!
955134,manitoubass2,2016-01-27 19:46:00,11391,Second pic.  Again sorry for the delay my friend  
955139,cheaptackle,2016-01-27 20:02:00,849,"Delay was pregnancy related?  Didn't we just used to call it a nooner? Good looking setup on the sled, like how the joinery was done especially keeping the thin profile above the ski.  Michael"
955141,davey buoy,2016-01-27 20:05:00,5505,"Very nice,same standard design,but that camo look great.!!!"
955142,wormdunker,2016-01-27 20:06:00,1711,"thanx Rick.  It's all good.  Gotta laugh at cheaptackle.  I did such a good job on the camo paint, he can't see the pix!  LMAO  I just used a dado blade on my table saw, went very slow & carefully.  2x4s fit very snug to the 2x8 blocks.  Thanx"
955147,misfish,2016-01-27 21:07:00,29133,"Nice job. Going to have to get hooked up with an electric set up for that 8"" auger."
955150,Acountdeleted,2016-01-27 21:21:00,2562,Very nice. The smitty sleds are such a treat on the ice.  I took the easy way out and just bought B's old one. Now I'm not sure I can ever go back to without one.
955159,chris.brock,2016-01-27 22:23:00,4053,"Nice job, that'll work! Those skis will slide effortlessly.  A cup holder and an OFC decal and you're done."
955165,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-27 22:52:00,8243,"I have to admit El Wormo you have some good skills, nice rig you have there. I don't know about the paint, that would be my dept. You can now go into semi retirement.  ""Build them and they will buy.""  You build them and I will airbrush them. 70 for me, 20 for you, we need to slide 10% to M2B2 because he knows how to post a pic."
955167,wormdunker,2016-01-27 23:02:00,1711,"Yah Brian, I have the manual for early thinner ice, when it gets over 8"" thick I pull out the Jiffy 9"" with stealth blade. Chris I forgot the cup (beer) holder.  How do I go about getting an OFC decal? Rusty Ironmaker - You must be Italian.  You always got an angle!"
955204,GBW,2016-01-28 05:21:00,8460,I need to build me another sled BUT how would one attach a bracket to tow behind a skidoo and do it safely?
955205,manitoubass2,2016-01-28 05:28:00,11391,Can you weld geoff?  Its pretty easy to make a bracket that mounts to your sled

955209,wormdunker,2016-01-28 07:44:00,1711,"GBW - You can buy the tow bar at BPS, Sail, Grimsby Tackle, Erie Tracker & most other guys that sell flip overs.  Install 2 heavy duty (3/8"") eyebolts & away you go.  I would advise some better quality hooks on the tow bar.  The hooks from the manufacturer are rather el cheapo.  My flip over came uncoupled from my atv once.  Had to go back 1 km to get it.  Good thing this happened on Erie.  It was still there when I returned!  If it was Simcoe I'm sure some other dude would be riding around with my Clam full of gear!"
955223,Acountdeleted,2016-01-28 14:04:00,2562,I actually have a tow bar from the smitty sled I bought off of B. I can't see every using it. PM me with your best price and lets make a deal GBW.
