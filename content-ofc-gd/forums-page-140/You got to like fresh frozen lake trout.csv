954825,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 22:05:00,8243,"It sure is nice to read about some fish being caught. Wormdunker and I were thinking about hitting Quinte. That is until I found out he runs and guns drilling holes and doesn't have a 2 man Clam. No way no how I am roughing it like we did 40 years ago. I want 5 star accommodations out there at my age. I'm impressed with both his fitness and passion, something I lost a few surgeries ago."
