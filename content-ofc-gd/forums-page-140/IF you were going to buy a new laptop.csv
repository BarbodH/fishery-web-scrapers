Besides that he never puts anything in the trunk of his car anyway. Although not very sexy all he needs is a Ford Escort ( a note book to use for these sites and type a letter).

While Macs may be less prone to virus they are certainly not immune anymore. The best way to protect yourself from malware is to be logged on as a standard user, not an admin. That way you have no rights to install anything so malware can't either. If you do need permissions the UAC will pop up asking for an admin password which you can provide when required. That and keeping antivirus programs up to date will prevent most attacks. I picked up a nice ASUS notebook for my wife 4 years ago and it's still going strong. It came with a full 2 year warranty as well. I bought it from a local computer shop, which I would highly recommend over a big box store. As far as an OS goes, I can't stand Windows 8 with no start menu and Windows 10 has many privacy issues so I would suggest to stay with Win 7.  Cheers"

I want another one someday. I loved that thing, ASUS is a strong company and good customer service."
953464,i2cool2fool,2016-01-16 17:57:00,349,Lenovo is a good company for laptops. Agreed. I picked up a Lenovo G50 laptop before Christmas for $500.  I am quite happy with the purchase.

953472,Fisherman,2016-01-16 18:41:00,7201,"I would avoid the big box stores, if something goes wrong, jeez knows where they ship them to and for how long to get fixed. I've heard multiple horror stories.  I found our local wizard in Barrie (Dr Computer Logic) and have been with him since about '95.  He has a good bunch of tekkies that fix stuff right and don't screw ya around.  They also sell commercial refurbs, completely rebuilt and reinstalled operating systems.  My last one cost me $250 with complete file transfers out the door.  They even gave me back my old one for networking if I wanted.  Look around in town or maybe Peterborough if they have any reputable dealers."
953475,Terry,2016-01-16 19:00:00,14456,"you do not need a mac, based on what i think I know about your computer use you dont need a high end PC if there is a computer store near you that also services what they sell, that would be a good starting point a 1000 bucks is more computer then you need, ask if it is compatible with the programs you have already or if you will need to buy newe programs......."
953481,dave524,2016-01-16 20:25:00,4508,"I always had confidence buying electronics at Costco. They extend the manufacturers warranty to 2 years, 90 day return and the couple of times I've used their 1-800 Geek service I got a knowledgeable guy, living in Ontario and English was his first language. One time it was a defective unit another was operator error   .   http://www.costco.ca/concierge.html"
953493,John Bacon,2016-01-16 21:28:00,3277,If your new laptop does not have a DVD drive then you should be able to pick up an external one that connects to a USB port at a reasonable cost.
953506,Fisherpete,2016-01-16 22:46:00,1814,If your new laptop does not have a DVD drive then you should be able to pick up an external one that connects to a USB port at a reasonable cost. Yes - I saw good brand name external DVD drives for only $30-40 at Canada Computers the other day - pretty good deal
953510,BillM,2016-01-16 22:52:00,17367,"One feature that you'll appreciate would be a backlit keyboard.  Personally I run the Dell XPS line for my personal stuff, hasn't let me down yet and the customer support has been pretty good when needed."
953512,GBW,2016-01-16 23:27:00,8460,"Well I have worked for Dell, HP (when it was Compaq), Samsung and smaller IT companies as well; my pick's for quality, price and support is as follows: 1, Dell 2, HP 3, Lenovo (new name when IBM sold them overseas) All others are a tier 2 or 3 (or worse!) MFG in the PC world. Cliff, KLBE doesn't sell PC's (locally dealer when I looked last time) but I know a company whom I worked for called CDI (computer dealers inc) who take off lease from 'big business' after a year or so (max 3 years old hardware) and they do a 100% rebuild and sell it to small (and large) resellers of IT hardware for very low prices and with a good warranty too. Feel free to MSG me if needed."

953516,SirCranksalot,2016-01-16 23:57:00,3291,My wife bought a Lenovo Thinkpad with Win 7 installed about 6 mo ago for about $300. She's not a heavy duty user and is quite satisfied with it.  We bought it from the little shop down the road. The woman there says she can price match the bi box stores any day of the week.
953521,FloatnFly,2016-01-17 01:07:00,1640,"For me, it would be MSi, ASUS then Lenovo.  check Canada Computers, they have some pretty good prices on laptops.  Something like http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=710_577_369&item_id=088311i think would be perfect for your needs"
953524,adempsey,2016-01-17 01:19:00,1498,"I wouldn't hesitate to purchase an ASUS, HP or Lenovo (used to be IBM I believe) laptop.  Dell has been hit and miss for me.  I haven't dealt with Dell in a long time, but they did have great service.  You might have to pay extra for it though, not sure.  The HP and ASUS laptops I purchased are still going strong after many years.  Batteries had issues, but that's a guarantee no matter what you get.  My go to store is Canada Computers.   I bought an HP from a big box store though.  Costco is always a great choice because of the warranty.  Also, what OS are you using now?  Windows 8 and 10 are so different from previous versions.  Personally, I don't like them at all.  So, that might be a consideration.  I'd recommend testing it out first.  Macs are nice, but still over priced.   You should still try one and see if it's your thing or not.  Personally, I'd go with a desktop unless you're on the road a lot.   I really dislike laptops.  A desktop I can fix myself if something goes wrong (by fixing, it's really replace the part that broke), but a laptop is a whole other problem."

There is no comparison for the money. I have had Mac, good windows etc. Will buy chrome every time from now on."
953612,Beans,2016-01-17 18:48:00,3339,Cliff:...I checked with our family resident PC expert Mike and even though he doesn't have one he sez his fellow employees at Microsoft are high on Dell laptops...  I use a Dell dude...
953619,GBW,2016-01-17 19:28:00,8460,come pick me up and let's go shop today...
953628,Big Cliff,2016-01-17 20:19:00,6899,Thanks for the offer Geoff but I am only THINKING about buying a new one right now. Got to put a few more pennies in the bank account before I make the decision.
