Wouldn't be right not to.  Get out there and do it again.  Clear -35°C FEELS LIKE -52  Thx Bunk, your getting slammed with some of the winter we are missing , the trout was a dink compared to the ones you connect with while guiding on the big lake, but getting that one on one of the lakes off the Trail, well I was pretty stoked, definitely my biggest so far,  It is crazy good to be fishing quite often with your sled suit on but your parka undone, like fishing on Lake Simcoe lol  As u know -20 or 25 feels balmy, no hut needed  Be good , be safe up there , talk to u soon"
