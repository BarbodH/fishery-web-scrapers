535384,Cosmos,2011-01-06 15:01:00,588,I was fishing Potters RD last Sunday. It was 4' of black ice. I saw a guy who was drivng 4wheeler with hut attached.
535560,cityfisher,2011-01-06 22:08:00,959," Obviously hes not to smart and lucky to make it back to shore. Anyone who fishs quinte often knows the ice is always inconsistent. Couple years back i took my quad on the ice, First spot 8 inches, 200 yards later at spot 2 we had 3-4 of crap ice... what the hell ... we luckly made it back to shore that evening. The next day my buddy thought he was OK to ride his sled out in differnt area with his portable attached... Well he found open water... Skipped accross but his Hut and gear broke off and went down with the eyes."
