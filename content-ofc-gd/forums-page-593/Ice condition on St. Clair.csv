535589,Sandbag,2011-01-06 23:12:00,533,"Hey Gino...I know that guys have been out on Mitchell's Bay and St. Lukes for a couple of weeks now.  Not sure what that last warm spell did to the conditions though.  You can call Dennis and Bass Haven in Mitchell's Bay and he will give you the detail, water clarity, color to use and anything else you are looking for.  Just Google Bass Haven and you will get the number.  Cheers and Good luck  Craig"

535685,gino,2011-01-07 02:00:00,400,thank you guys for the quick response...i will call before go there
535700,Handlebarz,2011-01-07 02:33:00,3790,Check out the Bass haven web site Dennis gives good info with all the warm water flowing out the Thames and the pumps running right now I dont know how clean it will be to head down here if your looking to get out fishing I would head else where for this weekend but if your down in this area you can find some spots. The cut at Bass haven is closed right now and there is alot of bad ice out front where a truck and quad went through the ice this week. Call first for sure I guess is what I meant to say LOL
