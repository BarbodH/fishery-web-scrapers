Is BBP or Bear Point at all solid?  Thirdly, I looked at the mnr regs but can't seem to find the answer.  What is the max number of hooks I can run from one line 4 or 5?  The reason I ask is that if I am going perch fishing I want to try this new sabiki rig I recently got from the states.  thanks"
535722,daryl0815,2011-01-07 03:24:00,225,"Hey Cudz  I was just looking at the regs the other day about the same question and found this:   ""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure.""  http://www.mnr.gov.o...L02_165347.html  so I guess that the answer is 4 in total  I dont know anything about ice conditions other than at Virginia Beach, which had plenty of ice last weekend, so I imagine by now that it is really safe out there, last weekend there were people crazy enough to be driving their cars around out there!
