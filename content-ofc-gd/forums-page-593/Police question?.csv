536186,lew,2011-01-07 23:47:00,12766,"Thirty odd years ago my brother was driving along the 401 near Belleville in a red Ford van when 3 police cruisers came up behind him, boxed him in and forced him outta the truck at gun point. After they did some checks they realised they had the wrong guy but apologized and explained that there had just been an armed robbery and the punk with the gun had taken off in a red Ford van exactly like my brother was driving.  My brother accepted their apology and thanked the coppers for doing a tough job and went on about his business.   Back in 1963 there was a big fight between 2 biker gangs in front of Scarboro arena in Scarboro. There were a couple dozen bikers trying to kill each other and just a handful of cops trying to arrest them. I was driving by and foolishly stopped to watch, got too close to the fight and was grabbed by the cops, handcuffed along with a bunch of bikers, tossed in the paddy wagon and spent the weekend in the old Don Jail before everything got straightened out. I received  apologies from the Toronto Police Dept and the Chief of Police.  I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and in all the confusion I got grabbed but the police were very fast to set things straight when the mistake was figured out.  As for the dispute in this post, I'd much rather see a cop pull his gun when it's not needed than see a cop murdered because he didn't have his gun out.  They've got a tough job to do and it's getting tougher everyday.  But that's just my opinion"

Now dont go all hay wire here ok.it,s a smoke.She lights up a smoke and passes it to me.All of a sudden the two door go flying open on the elderado, and we have two people(one male the other female) asking if were smoking dope? Lucky for me, at the time   ,I wasnt.She was just lightn up a cig to get a taste of tabackie, then passing it to me. Never did we see a badge shown,but they left as quick as they came when they noticed we werent doing the weed thing.  So this stuff happened back in the eighties and now it happened in  2000.  The gun was a bit of an over kill,but back then, they probly didnt have the scare factor they have today. Just sharing and saying."

Fish n autographs said that sitting in a car and eating to him is suspicious activity.  All I am saying is that if I am in a car eating my lunch  why not give me the civilian the benefit of the doubt.  If we give them the right to search us all and enter our houses than that's just what they will do.  Search everyone who seems guilty.  Kinda takes all the police work out of it.  It called laziness.  Do your police work, when you have your man make an arrest.  Like I said earlier I have a lot of respect for cops. The ones that do the job the way it is meant to be done.  There are few higher on my respect meter.  But I absolutely loathe the bad ones.  There is very few things that are more repulsive than an abuse of power or the apologists that beg for more of it."

Checking 2 people in a vehicle isn't an abuse of power nor is it being lazy. Just because I can't tell what their doing doesn't mean I'm going to drive away.

536215,Grimace,2011-01-08 00:21:00,2020,Doing it with a gun is down right stupid and a long ways from protocol.  Like I said in an earlier post if you aproached me in a vehicle and treated me with respect I would resent it but would be more than cheerful.  If you treated me like a criminal I would tell you to stuff it.  What was described by the OP and what you would defend is nothing even close to either of those things.  You have stated in the past about how people talk their way into tickets and how you decide who to let go and who to ticket and how you think that a simple everyday action that you deem to be suspicious is just cause for questioning and even the drawing of firearms.  I am uncomfortable with that.  I do not want to come off as a cop basher here because I am very very far from that but I must also state as a citizen that I enjoy my rights and will argue for as many of them as I can.  They are not rights if they can be taken away.

536243,Ziki,2011-01-08 00:42:00,128,"  Sorry Cliff, but you completely missed the point. You are (probably, it's not really relevant) right about how the officers started getting free coffee.  But the stereotype? That started as a result of the differentiation between police and the public. I implied this initially, perhaps I should have stated it.  When every member of the public pays for a coffee and then an officer goes in and gets one for free it creates segregation. This fosters jealousy and resentment for the police in the view of the public.  Don't treat them like God's and maybe they won't act like it!"

536131,Big Cliff,2011-01-07 22:31:00,6899,"""How do you figure the doughnut stereotype started?""  Do any of you know where it started?  It actually started because many donugt shops were the only places open late at night and they were cash businesses.  They were often targeted by guys knowing they could grab some cash and get away quickly so many of the coffee/donut shop owners started offering the cops free coffee and donuts so they would come around more often durring their night shift. Once that started the number of roberies dropped dramatically.  The tradition lives on to this day!  Now, why don't we start a thread to bash lawyers or politicians? What about Snaggers or people that take OS fish or over their limit(oh wait they are fisher persons too aren't they so if a few bad cops mean most of them are bad it only stands to reason that most fisher persons must be bad because a few break the law). Sorry, I don't see the logic in that attitude!"

536176,Grimace,2011-01-07 23:33:00,2020,It's ok to let a doctor off for speeding (breaking the law).  And you also feel that the cop was justified in pulling a gun on a 17 year old kid for eating a slice of pizza in his car ( not even bloody close to breaking the law) just because he was suspicious of something.  Sounds like great judgement is being executed.

535976,mercman,2011-01-07 18:53:00,7054,"  BOB,  you are a man of few words, but when you speak, great things come out of your pie hole"
535979,Ziki,2011-01-07 18:55:00,128,"  Ahh, like feeding the animals in the park this should not be done. You are just feeding the police officers ego, encouraging his belief that because he is enforcing what the law states is right/wrong he is morally superior. By offering the officer a discount you are encouraging this god like complex.  Police officer wages are governed by the laws of supply and demand, with externalities included for the danger inherent in their work. There is no reason to impose your own externalities upon the police by treating them any differently than any other human being.  How do you figure the doughnut stereotype started?"
535984,Billy Bob,2011-01-07 19:02:00,5865," You must be kidding right...  There are many discounts out there.....I get one in many place in my home town because I'm a fire fighter...  Others get them because they are seniors or just have a coupon...  It called getting or earning a break......my son once got stopped on the NYS Thruway speeding on a Sunday in a construction zone...no workers present....the State Police Officer notice his military ID when he was removing his drivers license as asked. The officer asked ""are you in the military"" yes sir, the Air Force my son answered.....he handed back his drivers license and said ""have a nice day""...  Bob"
535988,fishing n autograph,2011-01-07 19:08:00,2540,The coffee shop stereotype started way back in the day when that was the only thing open after 11pm for coffee...
535991,Grimace,2011-01-07 19:17:00,2020,I am thrilled that the military is allowed to speed through construction zones.  I work in them.  If i get run over my son and wife will not give half of a crap if the guy is in the military or not.  Sorry but your son military or not deserved a ticket.  I respect the police.  The good ones I love and the bad ones I absolutely loathe.  Feelings get exaggerated like this when power is involved.  There is not many things more repulsive than an abuse of power.  If fish n autographs came to my truck in a parking lot and cheerfully said hello to get a feel for me.  I would resent it a tiny bit but be cheerful back and crack a joke knowing he was not being a jerk.  However if treated like a criminal for nothing I would respond by telling the police officer to go stuff it.
535994,Billy Bob,2011-01-07 19:19:00,5865," I really think our police cars should be advertising on them to help defer the cost of the cars.  Something like a big sign on the back of the police car reading ""Follow me to Tim Hortons""..."

Specially if I was working or eating lunch as you'd be taking my time away from me for no reason.    Fishing was good  Winternet Topic change....  Today .....not much ice. Anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of black and people were walking out like it was safer than safe...   One whack with the spud and you'd go right through. The guy on the snowmobile sure ran away fast when we showed him how little the ice was underneath him...

536036,irishfield,2011-01-07 20:07:00,26272," Exactly Grimace, I was riding with a cousin that's a cop and he was nailed for speeding. After taking the ticket he said to the officer... ""thanks, I'll do the same for you some day and showed him his ID"". Officer said why didn't you show me that before I wrote you up and my cousin asked him if ""we"" were above the law!  I do have a funny though... I took my Superbird to a meeting at the Brampton Airpark a few years back. Leaving later than I wanted too... I was moving pretty good up airport road heading home and got nailed by a cop with radar sitting on a cross road. When he finally caught up to me and I pulled over he said.. ""Jesus lad.. let me see your pilots licence"" and I pulled it out and handed it to him. He couldn't keep his composure and handed it back to me, went back to his car and pulled a U turn and left !!"
536037,solopaddler,2011-01-07 20:13:00,8605, That's awesome Wayne.
536052,ch312,2011-01-07 20:45:00,1590," well, a trained officer should be able to assess each situation and act accordingly. but, the problem is there are many cops out there that don't think before confronting someone and switch to ""arrogant, egotistical, power tripping mode"" automatically before even having the chance to assess the situation.  let's use fishnautographs approaching guys sitting in a car as an example. he probably walks up to them and talks to them like normal human beings, but i'm sure he turns into a real hardass when he knows something is up which is totally fine. unfortunately, many cops aren't like that and they'll switch to power tripping mode before even figuring out what the guys in the car are up to and treat the innocent folks like they're garbage.  if someone deserves to get dealt with by a heavy hand and attitude then i'm all for it. but, it's not cool when innocent people have to put up with this for no reason at all.   just because someone becomes a cop or joins the military they shouldn't be punished for breaking the law? it's that way of thinking that has made so many of them arrogant pricks with huge ego's.   lack of punishment is probably the #1 reason for some cops doing as they please..."

535924,mercman,2011-01-07 17:39:00,7054," here is the original post, for those who have forgotten about it. The question is, was it legal. The correct answer can only be addressed by a lawyer or judge. Any lawyers or judges out there who want to put this to rest ?????  I admire Cops and what they do. Humans are the most unpredictable animals on earth, and should be dealt with accordingly, as unpredictable.

535926,ketchenany,2011-01-07 17:48:00,3229," About five+ years ago my daughter owned a VW Jetta and there was always a cruiser parked in front of our house  Tavio Way (FandA you probably know it) one night she lent the car to her fiancee and got promptly stopped (11 pm)  I called and asked what the problem was as my neighbours were starting to ask ?s regarding this activity. I was told there were stolen cars in the area etc.  I'm sitting reading the paper when I spot a cruiser outside after my call. I went outside and invited the nice man in and questioned him about it . . . The stolen story was not true but what was, is that the previous owner's daughter was mixed up with unclassy people and they were checking to see if she had returned in the area! And advised us to change our locks.  I called my daughter down and he showed me a picture of who they were looking for and it wasn't her obviously she is not of Asian descent.  As the conversation lasted about 10 minutes and was very friendly I asked him if he would take her outside and put her in the cruiser just to get the neighbours going? He turned me down but we had a good laugh and was on his way."
535928,Twocoda,2011-01-07 17:49:00,4130," I agree but its apparent Terry had the luxury of time to play with the police that day...me i would just said  ""eventually to a friends place"" and been on my merry way ..."

535933,Old Man,2011-01-07 17:54:00,822, You know what I think was Awesome? That a police officer was out there helping to prevent some drunk from T-boning and killing any of our family members or friends.
535936,cram,2011-01-07 17:56:00,1733, Its suspicious. Don't you get it? If you're sitting in a car you are probably up to something.  Same as if you see someone drinking a lemonade in a park.  Likely a troublemaker.

Kids; just grabbed a coffee and having a cigarette  I don't see or smell anything but coffee and cigarette smoke  Me: have a good night guys, stay warm  9 times out of 10 this is the extent of the conversation.

535893,troutologist,2011-01-07 17:03:00,951,"This has just baffled me on a few accounts.  First, really? no followup from the lad with the gun in the face? If I was doing nothing wrong and this happened to me, someone would be answering a few questions about a gun pointed at me.   Secondly, I cannot fathom that the act of sitting in a car eating outside an eatery is ground for suspicion. Seems to me innocent until proven guilty is reversed in the mind of some on this issue, I do this frequently, as I prefer to not eat and drive thus inevitably wearing lunch. I get it people smoke drugs in cars, but when did sitting in a vehicle (especially since cell phones and driving are now illegal) become such a suspicious act. If law enforcment did feel the need to walk up and ask me how my lunch was, I would certainly expect it be done with a little more decorum, than the story presented here."

535840,jedimaster,2011-01-07 15:21:00,3472," The reason that the media puts things in the light like this for the same reason this topic has more replies and views than any other started on this ""fishing"" forum. Police in Ontario have shown over and over why they aren't trusted by a good portion of the population due to a missuse of power and poor judgement. I too was in the military for 7 years, and have  considered a career in law enfourcement. I have several friends in the OPP, and they are the reason why I wouldn't care to be associated profesionally with any of them. Good guys to hang out with for a beer but not a group I care to live my life with.  Its not because of the dangers they face, I would gladly face those dangers if I felt like I was able to serve my duties with the ideals of doing the right thing. Its not like they are forced into servitude, they choose to be police officer's. Just like they choose how to act and react to situations like this and the thousands of other situations that defy reason, only a very small percentage of what get brought out into the limelight.  The fact of the matter is this cop was way out of line. Pulling a gun was not warranted based on what information we have heard here. To infere otherwise is disrepectful of what this young lad has said, and I commmend him for the way he brought up this topic.  I could rittle off many reasons as to why I personally have no respect for police officers, but this would be an entire tangent of this thread. Its not that I think all are bad folks, just every one I have had the pleasure of encountering, many times in a time of need. I am not just angry because I got pulled over for speeding, but my reasons are pretty justified, and have resulted in a suspension of two officers.  In the end, this kid should talk to his parents, and go down to the station and file a report. I would hope that he police officer would be reprimanded. In the end the most thats likely to happen is it would be mentioned in an informal way over a pint after work by this cops superior and they woul dbe laughing about it the whole time. I say this knowing several officer and hearing the stories about how things are run (goes back to my point why I choose not to be an officer)  Police, military and politicians are paid to be servants of the public. For the most part they go about there days without any repructions of wrong doing. By there superiors in some instances yes, but not to the public for whom they serve. When you get scrwed at canadian tire or bass pro or whatever retail do you not complain to the store and to clerks? Of course you do. Sometimes even yo umay write a letter to head office. That is your forum for complaint. The media is the publics forum for complaint with regards to the public sector. Think of Brian Burke and Ron wilson, John Fergusun the media is how these folks also get held accountantable.  And just as was said and commended ""If you don't like it stand in front of them"" I say ""If you don't like the media scrutinizing your mistakes, feel free to step down"""

535850,bassmaster4,2011-01-07 15:48:00,801,"thank you everyone for voicing your opinions to those saying my story is bogus think what you want, i am not going to file a report because there was no harm done to me and the cop was just trying to do his job like others have stated.  bassmaster4"
535853,mercman,2011-01-07 16:01:00,7054,"I think the key phrase here is 'we dont know all the facts' It would be easy to start a topic in here by ranting about something that happened to me, that angered me, even if i deserved it, without telling the story 100% truthfully. We all do it, to some extent in our lives.Hide a bit of the truth, to get a bit of sympathy. I dont think BM4 is telling us the complete story.He hasnt had much to say at all since posting this thread.Not calling him a liar either, so don't get crazy on me. Just sayin, he didnt give ALL of the facts we need to make a judgement on anything.  paul"
535855,radar,2011-01-07 16:10:00,138," Filing a report here is not necessarily a bad thing. It doesn't mean you are looking for their heads on a platter. If the cops did nothing wrong that will be the finding. If they did, then it is documented on their file. If enough complaints are filed then there will be sanctions for them. I'm sure even the decent cops would appreciate hot heads (if they were) being removed. It also helps you so that if you resemble some bad apples, you have voiced your concern that you have been improperly targeted and it is on the record in case it ever happens again.  If they felt it important enough to approach you that way, they should have called for back up while you were there. I think 10 against 2 would have been much better odds. It would have been safer for everybody. You, Them and the public around you.  I appreciate them looking out for us but there is a right way and wrong way to do this. Don't read my comments the wrong way. I'm for more cops, tougher sentences etc. But I'm not ready to give up a simple pleasure like eating lunch in a parking lot at a restaurant."
535857,cram,2011-01-07 16:17:00,1733, Wow.  So 2 guys sitting in their cars eating lunch in a parking lot look guilty of something?  Are you insane?

535869,fishing n autograph,2011-01-07 16:33:00,2540,There's nothing illegal or against anyones rights if I go talk to someone...  Honestly 75% of my drug arrests are found by walking up to kids in parked cars...

535718,bassmaster4,2011-01-07 03:18:00,801,yes i am 100% sure he was a police officer he showed me a badge and began talking on his radio after he had pulled the gun
535720,bassmaster4,2011-01-07 03:21:00,801,this guy had his badge attached to his belt under all of his baggy clothes
535752,cram,2011-01-07 05:05:00,1733,"I think you should assume it was a case of mistaken identity (thought you were someone dangerous) or just a bad apple.  Its one guy, not indicative of all of what cops are or aren't."

535754,Cudz,2011-01-07 05:17:00,2652,I beg to differ Wayne.  That parking lot is not a good place to buy crack.  There are undercover cops who pull guns for no reason.  The parking lot 2 blocks south is probably a better location.
535756,GoneFishin,2011-01-07 05:38:00,349,I had a police officer pull his gun on me and tell me to drop my inflatable dingy that I was inflating. I was 12 years old... They were searching for someone in the forest near my house but being only 12 I thought that was a little more then excessive. He was in full uniform though. Your situation seems a little sketchy. There's no reason to pull a gun because of drugs and especially if he wasn't even sure in the first place.
535759,Cookslav,2011-01-07 06:23:00,1457,"File a report.  Chances are it was simple mistaken identity. But for the record, If He thought you were a dealer and pulled the firearm to make his approach....chances are its because the dude he was looking for is a pretty bad dude. Probobly considered to be armed and dangerous, as are MOST Drug dealer.  Not to be insensitive but if it were me in his shoes, I'd do it the same way, as I like to come home to my wife and kids each night with the same amount of holes I was born with  What you went through was obviously scary, and a crappy way to end your lunch And I'm not saying your in the wrong, nor am I saying the officer was in right.... I'm just saying that the odds are the situation was warranted. Its a tough job but someones gotta do it or the bad guys do what they want. And lets face it....if this officer was undercover the chances are he's not writeing traffic tickets. I think the odds are most undercover officers are on the level.  But if you have any doubts, file a report and you'll find out. Cheers,"
535760,brickNblock,2011-01-07 06:37:00,598,"Im siding with Terry on this one... There are times you must be at places for what ever reason and mistaken identity or just a ..:Wonder who this is""..is all it takes for a take down.. Easy enough to say dont be in these places but what if youve got to pick up a worker youve never driven before or drop a worker off...or a different locale for a difficult to locate building material. ....Been there, done that and have had the guns pulled and my head against the curb under some cops foot..(RC's) actually.(thought I was a firearms dealer).  I have several freinds who are cops as well firemen..and soldiers in our proud services and Ive been told never ever report a cop or you be dogged for ever... These are good men I know and fish with in our annual derby, I trust them and wouldnt hesitate to call any of them, even on a cop and that is the advice they give.  If this indeed was a overly excited quick on the draw cop...Id stay right away from reporting him, more importantly never going near that location again. Some folks just never see the bad for thinking of the good.  Thats just the way I feel...I'll not say sorry but I am sorry that so many bad cops find their way through the weeding out process. Again..I beleive that most cops are good and will blindly trust with one eye open."
535769,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-07 10:14:00,2038,  Great Minds think alike
535774,highdrifter,2011-01-07 11:43:00,2534," Exactly.  This sounds totally bogus.  Report it to the right people, then maybe have a discussion about it on the forum afterwards, not the other way around."
535781,Billy Bob,2011-01-07 12:11:00,5865," The story seems fishy to me on two counts.....  1) Wouldn't the undercover police officer called in the plate number of the vehicle in question before approaching the suspects.  2) And the statement of the suspected perp saying there was a ""Glock 9"" in my face. How did the OP know it was a Glock and how did the OP know it was a 9mm caliber. There are over 20 different Glocks models and about 10 different calibers not to mention several other pistols that look like a Glock. Personally if anyone had any gun in my face I wouldn't be trying to determine it make, model and caliber and I'm a somewhat gun nut.  Was the OP ever in trouble with the law before or was the car (plate #) ever in some kind of trouble with the law before.  And finally was it a real police officer and if so and everything else is on the up and up why hasn't the OP made a trip down to that local police station and follow up on this incident. I know I would like many others here.  Will we ever get to the bottom of this......if we do then we need this group to consider opening up the JFK files...  Bob (Roy I want a Easter Bunny Emoticon) Think SPRING !"

That is if this is a legit tale, we are all fishermen...remember that 57"" pike caught on the ultralite spinning outfit rigged for perch the guy caught in the storm overflow pond story?   No not a true story but I think you get the drift.  If this incident played out as said then there is propably a reason for it to have happened that way and I feel for the employee that had to clean the chair seats after they left."

535787,mercman,2011-01-07 12:49:00,7054,"   Drop the gasoline sir, and reach for the sky !!! turd"
535792,Tarzan's Jane,2011-01-07 13:02:00,1183," Yes, that was legal.  Just as I wouldn't walk alone at night - for obvious reasons - neither would I sit in my car with a buddy in a parking lot eating my lunch, again for obvious reasons.  Some things in life, due to history and experience have clear indicators of wrong doing, especially to some police officers, those of course who do investigative work and who work undercover.  My son is a police officer, has been for 8 years.  And is moving up the ranks.  He has earned it because he is brave and continues to be one of those officers that just wants to rid this world of evil.  I know he is fighting a losing battle but it's his battle and this world needs him.  I hear a lot.  I cannot express the depth of the feelings of pride that I have for him.  My youngest son also wants to be a police officer.  Two sons putting their own life on the line to protect yours and mine.  Honest to God, believe that our world is full and I mean FULL of hateful people and people who would wear killing a police officer as an honor.  How twisted is that!  On that day, two young men invaded a home.  One sodomized and raped a 7 year old girl.  The other brutally beat and stabbed the little girl's mother.  The two men were seen leaving the home in a  vehicle described as the one you were sitting in.  I like to think that our men and women who give their life to serve and protect ours, would not approach these two men with smiles and their hand outstretched for a friendly shake.  We all have differences of opinion and we all think we could and would do better.  But take a good look at our world and it shouldn't take too long to figure out that we live in a heap of garbage.  We need more police officers, we need more conservation officers, we need tougher laws and we need men and women to take a stand and combat crime and criminals as though we were at war.  Which by the way, we are at war.  I think you learned something.....and that is to not hang out in your car.  Eat your pizza or whatever in the establishment where you purchased it or go home to eat it.  Our streets are not safe.  I hate it too that I could not allow my child to go to the park alone to play, I hate it that I can't go for a walk at night if I can't sleep, I hate it that if I am alone in my car at night and it breaks down that I would have to leave my vehicle and hide in the bush until decent humans came to help me.  But I do it because I have no other choice and because I *get it*."
535803,bubbles,2011-01-07 13:35:00,591,"Great topic......  Not sure I even know what side I am on, I could argue both ways as I sure most level minded people could.  The one thing I know for sure is if this is a true story and it happened to me I would be so pissed that I would have been down at the police station to file a report 2 seconds after it happened.  If his actions were justified for some reason none of us know, so be it, but if they were not his superiors need to know.  They have a tougher job than most people think, while most of us learn not to go down that dark alley that was pointed out earlier, cops are forced to."
535804,fishing n autograph,2011-01-07 13:38:00,2540," amen....  now that i'm in a different unit, i can see how tough it was....now all i do is deal with drunks and bad drivers!"

535816,Rich,2011-01-07 14:22:00,3927,If you think corruption in the law is a rarity... well ignorance is bliss I guess.
535818,solopaddler,2011-01-07 14:31:00,8605," Really? You wouldn't sit in your car eating lunch for obvious reasons? What reasons? Seriously are things so bad that you can't eat lunch in your car without raising suspicions? All due respect but that thinking is more than a little extreme.    Horrible, horrible story but are you seriously using this monstrous act as an analogy as to how a cop should approach a kid eating pizza in his car?    In any case you're rightfully proud of your son, he sounds like one of the good ones."
535601,mercman,2011-01-06 23:38:00,7054," AMEN BROTHER.  Don;t be too hard on em. They""ll be damn glad to have a cop on thier side someday when they are in a situation where they really need one. I for one, always give the local cops a discount in my store, even though they have never asked for one.They desreve it in my opinon."
535605,Terry,2011-01-06 23:44:00,14456," give me a gun and the same rights as they have and I think you would find many people would gladly stand in front of them and do without them  my right to bare arms to defend me and my property has be pretty well taken away...putting a dependence on using the cops for everything .........  oh and I server time in the armed forces so one could say I did stand in front of them,or with them as the bumper sticker says"
535616,Big Cliff,2011-01-07 00:04:00,6899," We've obviously had some very different experiences Terry. I too served time in the armed forces, 1RCR Delta Company Airborne.  I carried a gun, was trained on rocket launchers, SMGs and several other things, I also had rights that perhaps the average person didn't have. Does that mean I am a bad person? Does that mean that all soldiers are bad people? Well, maybe in the eyes of some."

535622,Terry,2011-01-07 00:15:00,14456, of course not and 99% of cops are not bad  but that 1 % sure screws things up  and I have had 2 bad experiences with cops and 100% it has tainted my view of them and has made me fear for my life when approached by cops  life experiences is how people/children learn . you touch something hot and you soon learn to not touch hot things you get beat up in a dark alley you learn to fear dark alleys well same with cops I have learnt not to trust them
535625,Twocoda,2011-01-07 00:21:00,4130,i dont think it will get locked on the account of Terry or Big Cliff...both are respected people of this forum..and can carry on a educated debate
535626,Terry,2011-01-07 00:23:00,14456,I see this as a friendly discussion ..nothing more
535627,Old Man,2011-01-07 00:23:00,822,"I really doubt that he was a real police officer. Undercover, no ID, gun already pulled. It was some crooks way of trying to score some drugs or valuables."
535629,Grimace,2011-01-07 00:25:00,2020,The kid is asking a question.  He does not seem to have any vitriol for the cop. He is just uncomfortable with what happened like anyone would be.  What happened was no where near what police protocol would be in that situation.  Maybe the guy was not a cop.  Maybe he was.  Go to the police station and find out.   Just because some of you have never had a bad experience with a cop does not mean that it has not happened.  I think I smelled an implication that maybe this young guy was asking for it as well. If I were him I would resent that a little. If he was all punk like I am sure it would have come across in his explanation.  He would not have received an apology either.  I agree with the statement that said we should not brand all cops with the same brush. I would like to add that the citizenry should be shown the same respect.
535630,spincast,2011-01-07 00:25:00,3279,"I agree with TB4me - was this guy really what he represented himself to be? It is clear that this situation was handled less well than it could have been, IF it was indeed an officer of the law, But just for the purposes of discussion....  In every vocation there are those who represent the positon they do with the utmost integrity, those who represent it well, those who could represent it better, and those who frankly shouldn't be there at all. Power and authority tend to exaggerate the failings and ignore the successes of those it touches.  There are always 3 sides to every story  it is difficult to judge the actions of others if you have not walked in their shoes or faced their demands  HOWEVER, if he happened to be acting on a tip that armed drug dealers would be in the area making a transaction that day... and if it was you assigned to do the stake out...... and you wanted to make sure you got home to your wife and kids tonight....   "
535633,Grimace,2011-01-07 00:27:00,2020,For the record I really think this was not a cop.  Sounds like someone trying to score some dope on the fly.  The police would probably be interested to hear it so they can sort it out.
535637,Twocoda,2011-01-07 00:33:00,4130,possibly divine intervention for bassmaster4...now he KNOWS he wants to work for Internal Affairs when he grows up...
535646,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-07 00:48:00,0,  Not a cop?.....  That's why the bad guy looking for drugs apologized... If some half cocked rookie cop stuck a loaded weapon in my 17 year olds face there'd be hell to pay. I'd love to see the cops face if it was done to him in return. The coward would probably start crying. Sorry if I seem a tad off. It's been done to me on more than one occasion and there is nothing that can be done about it. Just gotta suck it up and move on and hopefully it never happens again. No I don't hate all cops.  ...just the really bad ones....lol and there's enough of them around so it would seem.
535647,Grimace,2011-01-07 00:51:00,2020,True enough.  Robbers do not apologize.
535649,Twocoda,2011-01-07 00:57:00,4130,  sure they do  
535650,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-07 00:58:00,0,hahahaha

535664,Big Cliff,2011-01-07 01:30:00,6899, As do I and I respect Terry and his right to his opinion as I am sure he does mine! The beauty of friendship is that you can discuss and sometimes agree to disagree on something but still enjoy each others company at the end of the day.
535677,basketclam,2011-01-07 01:48:00,115,"I'm not going to get too far into the debate of good cops versus bad cops.  But I will say this - the ""cop's"" tactics don't seem to fit the standard at all, and I tend to side with the OFC'rs who have replied thinking that this may not even have been a law enforcement officer.  My advice to the chap who started this thread is to report it to the police and make sure that they know you're expecting some follow up.  If it was part of a legitimate operation, they should be able to tell you that much.  If it was not part of a legitimate operation, they should also be able to tell you that (and would probably be very appreciative of any information you can give them)."
535684,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-07 01:57:00,2038,I would go with the Police Officer's side of the Story....
535688,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-07 02:04:00,4399,"Ya maybe a little heavy handed but I look at it this way with the number of guns the bad guys have these days I don`t blame the Police for being very careful,if the guy would have walked up to a suspect car in a nonchalant manner and gets himself shot then what?"
535689,Dutch,2011-01-07 02:04:00,831,This story makes no sense at all.  A cop would never do this.  I don't think anyone looking for drugs would either.

535492,bassmaster4,2011-01-06 20:44:00,801,"Hey OFC, i had quite the scare today an undercover police officer ran up on me today as i was parked at a little caesars with my buddy having lunch. He suspected us of having drugs and he walked over and before anything was even said there was a glock 9 in my face. We were searched and we were clean and he left after appologizing. Was what he did legal? I am 17 years old."
535495,tb4me,2011-01-06 20:53:00,3295,Did you see any ID? Thats just crazy..Must have been on the hunt for somone you looked like..Did ya have to go home and change ur shorts? Id report him. The firearm seemed to be taking it a little to far..UNREAL..... Edit.. are you 100% he was a police Officer?
535500,Lunker777,2011-01-06 20:54:00,866,yea thats a little much !  Pulling a gun out for a simple check on some teenagers ??? was he a young guy ? possibly a little trigger happy and wanted to make an impression
535507,Terry,2011-01-06 21:02:00,14456,"well this is why some many people no longer respect the cops  they seem to use max force and aggression no matter the situation  seems coming with the gun drawn was a little much  did other cops show up did he show you his ID did you get this info  I would be checking to see if he called it in why didn't he wait for back up what was his reasoning for gun  seems to me he put you and himself at risk for no reason I would let people know, call the newspaper"
535510,mercman,2011-01-06 21:04:00,7054,"WELL at least he appologized. If you or your vehicule were a close match for a suspect, that might have made him a little jumpy.Cops these days have one heck of a job to do. One that i sure wouldnt want to do. Don't be too hard on him. Like i said, at least he said sorry, he was just doing his job."
535513,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 21:11:00,0,No..  .They are not supposed to do it that way. Nothing you can do about it though. Hopefully it never happens again to you and hopefully the trigger happy moron doesnt kill someone by mistake.  ...but of course it would go down another way than what really happened. Power tripping idiots that should be tossed out of the force and never allowed to own or handle a firearm again.  I tell ya though for the reason he had to draw it is a big reason NOT  to be a cop. There is a thing called back up and he does have a loud speaker. He didnt have to rush the car and put himself as well as everyone around him in danger. Public included. It sure aint worth losing your life over some drug offense. Not like it was a MAJOR bust....they had nothing... Gettem Danno!!
535525,Terry,2011-01-06 21:27:00,14456,"that was the point in my post  the only reason to draw a gun is for self protection or protection of the public....waiting for more cops would have solved the need to draw a weapon  the situation doesn't seem to fit the action it's true that we do not have all the details, but that guy should not be a cop  his instincts are not very good to draw a gun only to have no charges laid ......it's one thing to find out he didn't need that much force but it turns out he needed no force and totally misread the situation........he might be more suited to handing out parking tickets or carts at walmart"
535528,HTHM,2011-01-06 21:31:00,4082,I would call professional standards and let them know about this incident. I assume this was in Hamilton. Professional Standards 546-4776 or 546-4777
535533,jedimaster,2011-01-06 21:41:00,3472,"I would file a complaint, or better yet have your parents file a complaint. Situation sure didn't sound like it warranted have a weapon drawn, unless of course you were doing something to warrant it. Only you know that. If I was leaning up against my car minding my own business and had a gun pulled on me I would file a complaint the instant he turned around."
535534,bare foot wader,2011-01-06 21:41:00,1354,"little late but if you're ever in a similar situation ask for full name and badge number and then if you believe he/she engaged inappropriate action you can file a complaint  A Toronto Police Officer:  -will provide his or her name and badge number upon request. -who is not in uniform will present proper identification; you may ask to examine the badge and photo identification so that you are satisfied the person is a police officer. -will tell you why you are being stopped. -will only use the force allowed by law (for example, to stop an offence, effect the arrest of a suspect or maintain custody of a prisoner). -will generally arrest a person for a crime committed in the officer's presence, or when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person has already committed or is about to commit a crime.  Things To Do When Stopped  Again, officers are trained to place a great deal of emphasis on their safety and yours so they can do the job of safeguarding the public. Many of these guidelines conform to safety procedures, based on long experience, that officers are trained to follow.  Keep your hands where the officer can see them. Don't put your hands in your pocket or clothing. Stay put and stay calm. Don't walk or run from police. Don't touch any police officer. Cooperate with the officer. Don't get into an argument.  http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/whenstopped/"
535538,jedimaster,2011-01-06 21:48:00,3472,"hmm, so throwing him a sucker punch in the gut is a no no?  JK of course. Although I pay very close attention to obeying the law I have long since lost almost all respect for the police. This is another example of why."
535544,bare foot wader,2011-01-06 21:54:00,1354,"If you do not agree with the officer's conduct or actions during the stop, keep track of all pertinent information, including the officer's name and badge number. You have the right to complain at any police station of this Service, to the Professional Standards – Investigative Unit, or the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services. Officers are unable to handle your complaint on the scene."
535545,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 21:55:00,0,After the G20 its no wonder.... Rights?........  you have none!!!!
535552,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-06 22:02:00,10439,If it was all on the up and up he now has a bunch of paperwork to file because his side arm left it's holster. If he did not put this in his report he will be reprimanded by his superiors. Drawing your side arm is serious business and it definately sounds like it was not warranted in this instance and very likely he wil be reprimanded if it is reported.
535553,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 22:03:00,3761, The G20 is for another day...no comment
535555,bare foot wader,2011-01-06 22:04:00,1354,"the officer apologized and then sounds like he left pretty quickly?  he knew he was in the wrong...every time their gun is drawn paper work is involved...if he didn't provide id and show his badge, then it sounds like he was avoiding paper work and ridicule back at the station  i do genuinely acknowledge that our officers have a tough job as I do have several friends who became cops...but I've encountered enough bad cops at the same time...like to say I've gained wisdom through trial and error...LOL  ""blind trust"" perhaps but let the police do their jobs and make damn sure you know your rights and know what to do if you're involved in an incident and protect yourself from manipulation"
535563,Terry,2011-01-06 22:09:00,14456, When a moron has a gun pointed at you you have no rights    even if it's a stupid cop that's the moron
535570,bare foot wader,2011-01-06 22:21:00,1354," nah, not at all, you might not feel you have rights at that exact moment in time and it's best to cooperate and just let the incident end...but you still have rights afterwards and don't let a cop intimidate you from taking action afterwards  sounds like the kid ehre did the right thing and cooperate and the incident ended quickly...but don't let it just be water under the bridge...file a complaint, even without a bad number or name there is still a record of where they were while on duty...there may not be enough evidence to merit any sort of consequence to the cop but maybe he'll think twice next time...hell, who knows, maybe a security cam at little caesars or neighbouring business caught the whole scene???"
535573,jedimaster,2011-01-06 22:29:00,3472,"Check you tube.. yo umay already be the next Rodney King with 10,000,000 hits...."
535578,tb4me,2011-01-06 22:37:00,3295,Id love to hear more from Bassmaster on this..Im thinking it wasnt even a police officer..What better way to score some drugs..
535579,fishing n autograph,2011-01-06 22:41:00,2540,"remember there are 3 sides of the story...yours...his....and the truth  I wasn't there and I don't know what happened, but most likely, at least the times i've been involved, the plain/old clothes detectives have their badges around their necks and you or your car match the suspect vehicle in a violent occurance.  I know many good and bad guys and having a gun in your face for a little weed is more than excessive, even for the heavy handed guys  keep in mind that there are many people running around pretending to be cops so you might have met up with the wrong guys....who knows, but if you have issue with what happened then go with your parents to the HQ and speak with the officer in charge"
535583,Big Cliff,2011-01-06 22:50:00,6899,"I'm sorry but it really bothers me when guys call cops morons and the like. Perhaps I'm just lucky but I have never in my 65 years had a bad incident with a police officer, in fact just the opposite! I have always been treated fairly and in fact many many times I have had them go out of their way to help me. Sure I have had a few tickets over the years but never any that I didn't deserve and even then they were often reduced. Officer Cliff Tate here in Lindsay deserves a commendation for the way he helped me when I found my brother-in-law had passed away. I'll never forget him for what he did for me.  Sure there are some bad apples just like there are some bad fisher (persons) but don't tar them all with the same brush. The reason I never tried to become a police officer is because I'd have probably made Dirty Harry look like a little girl by comparison.  You guys can think what you want but I have nothing but respect for them! If you can't stand behind them; try standing in front of them!"
535585,jedimaster,2011-01-06 22:53:00,3472,  I believe in this case this kid was standing in front of him.
535587,Big Cliff,2011-01-06 23:02:00,6899, You know what I ment!
535588,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 23:11:00,3761," I really think people don't sometimes. I know when I'm in serious trouble there is one number I'll call first. We have right's and we live them everyday, yes he might...might of made a mistake but sometimes when they think they have right right house...or the right car, the gun comes out or the door get's blown down. They do there job and if somebody was hurt then this is  when it matters.  I have thought about going into the OPP after college...but my goal in life is to be a Conservation Officer here in Ontario or gladly in another province. These are things I learn of every day, respect these guys...I don't need to say why."
