534968,blindjustice,2011-01-05 19:03:00,6,"Hello All,  Great site, enjoy all the information!  Looking to renew my Fishing License and since I don't keep any fish I want to go with a Conservation License as opposed to a Sporting License.  My question is if I want to fish for Muskie I have heard that I need the Sporting License in case I inadvertently kill a fish and need to keep it. Is there any such regulation/law/opinion to this?  I would appreciate any feedback, as I'm not entirely opposed to getting a Sporting License.  Thanks."
534971,Terry,2011-01-05 19:12:00,14456,"well I keep every few fish so I had to decide with license to get  I was fishing whitefish on simcoe, with no intent in keeping any that day  I had one that couldn't release so I kept it  and hour later I had a second one that would not release, I realized that if I had a con. license I would be breaking the law so I decided that I would continue to buy a sports license and not have to let a fish float belly up in the water"
534972,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-05 19:17:00,3761,I get the Conservation license. Until I need to keep 5 bass in the boat(tournament) then I'm fine...I keep a few pike and panfish and have yet to have a fish I could not release these last 2 seasons.
534973,brifishrgy,2011-01-05 19:24:00,559,  you can fish for muskie with a conservation license you just need to release any fish caught regardless if its going to survive or not
534976,GBW,2011-01-05 19:28:00,8460,"Sport Fishing Licence: For anglers who want full catch and possession fishing privileges. In this summary, S - refers to limits under a Sport Fishing Licence (e.g. S - 4 = catch and possession limit of 4).  Conservation Fishing Licence: A reduced catch and possession limit licence that is ideal for anglers who want to live-release the majority of fish caught. Under this licence, anglers must immediately release muskellunge, Atlantic salmon and aurora trout. In this summary, C - refers to limits under a Conservation Fishing Licence (e.g. C - 2 = catch and possession limit of 2). Refer to the Zone tables and the exceptions for catch and possession limits. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/198219.pdf"
534983,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-05 19:44:00,2690,"I always buy the sport, just in case.  Wouldn't mind spending the extra $'s as much if the money went back into the fishery the way it truly should."
535009,Rich Clemens,2011-01-05 20:46:00,3131,"I also buy the Sportsman License for my Canadian fishing.   It's rare for me to keep anything, but will keep a couple bass for a fish fry on occassion.  (I may need it this year when I blow away the field at the OFC pike derby in June    )  I also do musky fishing and there have been posts on here as to what constitutes possession and what doesn't.  I never intend on keeping any, even if they are of legal size.  I'll spend the extra $$, just to be on the safe side."
