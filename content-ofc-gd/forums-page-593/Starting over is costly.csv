536249,Canuck2fan,2011-01-08 00:46:00,1444,"I have to agree on the expensive part... For 7 yrs buddies have been trying to get me in on their annual opening day trip on Callandar bay. Finally there was an opening...  2 ice fishing rods with reels 65 bucks.  Jigs swivels ice line and other assorted goodies 75.00  New waterproof gloves better boots 110.00  Tip up for outside 25.00  Share of gas for trip 65.00  Overnight accomodation 200.00  Fishing for 5hrs before the operator said it was unsafe we had to go in.... Catching only one walleye just under the slot and a 10"" perch PRICELESS. LOL."
535488,misfish,2011-01-06 20:36:00,29133,"Man it sure gets expensive starting all over, buying new ice fishing stuff. 2 years ago I gave all my stuff to my boys. Now that I want to get back into it,it,s put a bit of a hole in the pocket.  1 flip hut= $150 (best deal of everything) 2 rods= $55 2 reels=I had them 6 new lures pkg of barrel swivels= $65 ice pics,cleats= $15 2 spools of new line= $14 1 heater= $36 2 propane bottles= $10 1 gas auger= $450  Sure glad I didnt sell my floaters suit to Cudz.  And I havent even started buying gear for panfish yet   Oh well,only myself to blame I guess."
535490,irishfield,2011-01-06 20:38:00,26272,Why didn't you buy the auger at Costco for $267 ??? Savings = 4 large bottles of Wiser bud !
535491,fish_fishburn,2011-01-06 20:44:00,1311,I have to agree with Wayne...tough way to learn a lesson. Especially the Wisers part.
535517,I'mHooked,2011-01-06 21:19:00,525,"Isn't this when you go to your boys and say ""Do you remember that ice fishing gear I lent you? I'd like to borrow it back for 3 months"""
535520,kickingfrog,2011-01-06 21:21:00,8333,"""Starting over is costly""  No arguments here... although maintenance isn't cheap either."
535521,Terry,2011-01-06 21:22:00,14456,"yeah but it's worth it  isn't it...LOL   note to self, don't give away all my tackle to my kids......."
535523,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 21:26:00,0,You've got more to buy yet eh....
535527,Terry,2011-01-06 21:30:00,14456,yeah he needs a fishfinder  an underwater camera  a skidoo  an atv just in case there is no snow  and lures lots of lures
535539,misfish,2011-01-06 21:48:00,29133, Dont turn yer back Andy.
535558,aplumma,2011-01-06 22:06:00,6896,not to mention the beer budget while fishing.    Art
535562,misfish,2011-01-06 22:08:00,29133,  Those days are long gone Art.
535567,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-06 22:11:00,10439,Now you just need to drop a hun more for a Lowrance Ice Machine or flasher and you can go catch a bunch of fish.
535581,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 22:46:00,3761,"Might cost you in the end but as long as you don't break the bank too much you can upgrads your gear, make it more refined and have some fun testing out new stuff."
535584,misfish,2011-01-06 22:51:00,29133,"  Ah,just like you?,,,,,,   I pretty much know what works and dosent out there.   Thank gawd I still have all my bass gear."
535590,solopaddler,2011-01-06 23:13:00,8605,Starting over is costly?  There's always fishing related expenses. Mine just constantly grow and grow grow.  I think I need sponsors.
535594,mercman,2011-01-06 23:23:00,7054,Must be Nice to be independently wealthy
535610,misfish,2011-01-06 23:58:00,29133,"  Aint me,you must be talking about Mike."

535667,misfish,2011-01-07 01:37:00,29133,  Now you tell me.  How was the golf game bud?
535745,Skud,2011-01-07 04:31:00,739,Drove 15 hours to golf in the snow.     Had fun regardless.
535746,Cudz,2011-01-07 04:40:00,2652,"Are you going out Sat morn Brian? I am going out, just not sure where. Wanted to catch some lakers from oro but no ice as far as I know. Probably end up going for perch down gilford way."
535805,bubbles,2011-01-07 13:40:00,591,"My wife better not see this post, as far as she is concerned I can get away with like $25 for ice fishing stuff!"
536038,aplumma,2011-01-07 20:15:00,6896,you used the old look how tiny the rod and reels are they were just $5.oo sweetie.   Art
536181,Rodwrap,2011-01-07 23:41:00,130,Giving your stuff to the kid was cheap..lol  Try getting rid of a wife & see what starting over costs ya !  I saved my rod building shop cause lawyer insisted I had that before she entered my life...thank God ...!!!!
