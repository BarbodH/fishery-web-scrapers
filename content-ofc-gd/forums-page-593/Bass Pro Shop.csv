534786,walleyemaster,2011-01-05 01:14:00,325,"the pro is a good place but not always the best priced place..i know they price match but you have to prove to them the price from the other store is less and no flyers show the other stores entire price list.. for example le baron has.. fishing line, dipsy divers, lures ,rods and other products for less and they are not listed in any special flyer, so if you happen to be at the pro take a look at what you want then price it at le baron and see.. dont get me wrong i love the pro but i also hate buying something for more money if i dont have to, besides this is a place to help others who love fishing like me and i hope i helped..thanks.."
534903,skeeter,2011-01-05 14:50:00,1907,here's a good example:  the boating safety kit. the one in the orange container. i saw it a few years ago at bass pro for $24.99 i informed the manager of the fishing dept that the exact same kit was $11.99 at ctc and $9.99 at walmart. she said she couldn't do anything about the price because head office sets the price. she said she would let them know. 1 year later I'm in bass pro and its still $24.99 the next year its still the same. i forgot about it when i was in there the other day to check and see if they woke up yet.  
534986,LeXXington,2011-01-05 19:48:00,1928,If my wife did that to me. I look would look into her eye's and say very sweetly ok what did you buy and how much did it cost me.
535314,EddieNorth,2011-01-06 05:51:00,64,"If your wife has a single sister with that same great attitude,im sure there are plenty of guys aroud here that would be interested."

535749,irishfield,2011-01-07 04:51:00,26272,I'd say she's got you and that's enough... but that would be an outright lie Dann !!!  They sell a nice camo teddy at BPS... or is it Cabellas... it works so well I never see it...

534362,skeeter,2011-01-03 22:50:00,1907,"My wife gave me a $50 gift card for bass pro for xmas. now I'm all excited cause i want a sled to pull my gear out with that is less bulkyer then the one i built. i go on to there web site and cant find any sleds, now I'm bummed out. this morning she says , lets go and see if you can find something else you might want. ok, so off we go but im not excited cause i really don't need anything else. we get there and start looking, float suits,rods,lures blah blah blah. well there some of those badboyz that everyone talks about, $3-$6 each. i am not spending $50 on lures and that's that....... walk over to look at the portable huts(just to kill time) I'm looking inside the clam base and i hear her say, ""are those the sleds you were talking about?"" stacks of 4 different size OTTER sleds. she goes over to the monster sled and says, is this big enough? the kind that have a tow bar on the front. $269---NOT then she says , what about this one. its the next size down, ya and how much is that one? $74.99 she says,, say what let me see, hmmmm 64""x29""x11"" well that would probably do but its $25 more then my gift card. then she says , if you want it ,get it and i will pay the extra for it I pick one up and start to head for the cashier. but what about those lures you said you liked? i know have the sled and 6 badboyz in my tackle box.........
