534882,bassman87,2011-01-05 12:54:00,586,"Nice job man!!  I notice you have the mustang ms-195 atlantic class float suit. What size is it? I''m 6 ft 180 lbs and wonder if a large would fit, thanks."
534884,limeyangler,2011-01-05 13:08:00,5204,"Nice pike Long, great intro. Welcome aboard"
534936,ah_long,2011-01-05 16:22:00,354," I have the medium... I'm around 5'9 155lb... I think a large should fit you perfectly...  Someone told me that the float suit should be purchased according to your weight as it's supposed to keep you buoyant... so if you are 5ft and you weigh 180lb, technically you still need a large..  I got mine @ LeBaron when they have the 10% off w/ no tax sale.. ended up costing around $325 all in or sth like that"
535091,bassman87,2011-01-05 23:45:00,586,"Sweet, thanks for your input Long."
