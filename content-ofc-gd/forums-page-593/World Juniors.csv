535458,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 18:57:00,655," LOL  The Russians played their hearts out when the Canadians seemed to go to sleep in the 3rd thinking they had the game. It was a crappy outcome for us, but the most exciting comeback in junior history. Congrats Russia, you deserved it!"
535059,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-05 22:51:00,2690,"Congrats to the US on the bronze medal!!  Good effort, against a tough Swedish team."
535063,misfish,2011-01-05 22:59:00,29133,"Watched the game.The Sweds did not play as tough as they did our boys.No real jump in thier game.The American boys played a great game,better then they played us.   Congrats to them,,,     Now only 1.5 hours til the big show."

535150,danbouck,2011-01-06 01:15:00,4380,what a goal!
535151,bigugli,2011-01-06 01:17:00,6138,They're giving the Russkies a real taste of Canajun hockey. Just 2 more periods to go.
535161,Cosmos,2011-01-06 01:30:00,588,Go Russia!
535172,Grimace,2011-01-06 01:53:00,2020,I love the fact that the states beat the yappy swedes.  They are not usually that way.  Good for the Americans.  Steve Yzerman's advice for team Canada before the tournament.   Be humble and trust your linemates.
535176,bigugli,2011-01-06 02:03:00,6138,Getting close now I didn't buy enough beer!
535198,Rattletrap2,2011-01-06 02:40:00,1652,What the frig just happened?
535211,Grimace,2011-01-06 02:51:00,2020,Complete meltdown.
535219,Smarty Pantz,2011-01-06 02:56:00,203,   That was unreal   meltdown for sure
535222,uglyfish,2011-01-06 02:58:00,981,most pathetic thing ive ever witnessed. looks like we're losers for the second straight year.that just ruined my year....
535223,Dutch,2011-01-06 02:58:00,831,Too bad - Should have switched goalie after the 2nd or 3rd goal. At least for a minute or two to let him clear his head.  Cowan screwed up big time on defensive assignments.  Russians did play very well in the 3rd.  Great goalie change by the russians - Canada should have taken note of that one.....
535224,Cosmos,2011-01-06 02:59:00,588,Nice game for sure.
535225,Mattones,2011-01-06 02:59:00,587,Canada may of lost but the Russians screaming into the camera made me LOL!
535226,BillM,2011-01-06 03:00:00,17367," Our goalie played fine, the rest of the team absolutely COLLAPSED around him..  No hitting, no winning the battles in the corners, no nothing..  We deserved the silver."
535229,Twocoda,2011-01-06 03:02:00,4130,hooooooleeeeeeeeeee crap!!!!!! i was sitting there hoping the game would get at least mildly interesting ...but i didnt hope for that outcome...  Way to go Russia...you wanted and deserve it!
535234,skeeter,2011-01-06 03:10:00,1907,"Canada didnt lose. They won silver the only thing they lost was the game. russia out played them, or it wouldnt have been 5-3.  there is nothing wrong with silver!!!!! if silver is not good then why is the stanley cup silver?  hold your head high canadian players, you guys did great.... "
535268,Mattones,2011-01-06 03:40:00,587,As long as theybeat the states right!
535318,Minnow,2011-01-06 06:50:00,177,"I am a Russian Fan and watching the last 3 games seemed unreal! Comeback against Finland, Comeback against Sweden, and the most epic comeback against Canada! These 3 wins showed that hockey is a 60 min game and that even when down you are not out. Russia wanted it more and outplayed Canada in the 3rd period and it is as simple as that. Congratulations to the Russian Team for playing with all their heart throughout the tournament and never giving up. Tough game to win being down 3-0 in the third period and having 20,000 Canadian fans cheering against you and Russia played some of the most amazing hockey I have ever seen in the 3rd period! Russia and Canada are both amazing hockey nations and congrats to both teams and I can't wait for the next showdown in one of the best rivalries in sports! Russia Baby!"
535338,wallyboss,2011-01-06 12:18:00,1095,"It's there own fault that they lost.  If you look at the Logo on there shirts there's half a Maple Leaf on it, so they only played half a game then the Maple Leaf came in."
