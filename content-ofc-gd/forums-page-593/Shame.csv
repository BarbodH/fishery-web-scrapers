535214,mercman,2011-01-06 02:52:00,7054,the HORROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
535216,Grimace,2011-01-06 02:53:00,2020,Shame is a horrible word to use to describe a hockey team representing it's country.  It was a meltdown that is for sure but shame?   Give your head a shake.
535227,bigugli,2011-01-06 03:01:00,6138,The looks on the boy's faces say it all. They got smug and gave it away.
535238,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 03:12:00,3761,Well if anything Canadian teams love there summer golf...these guys stink...don't try to defend our team...they just fell apart like a senko.
535241,Grimace,2011-01-06 03:16:00,2020,It was a complete meltdown.  But to shame them or to say they stink?   That's garbage as far as I am concerned.  Certainley shows your character.
535243,Twocoda,2011-01-06 03:19:00,4130, Golf is a great sport...it was invented to keep people out of the rivers
535244,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 03:20:00,3761," To be honest, I never watched the game, just read people crying on facebook...It's a game, there not both winners are they. We can't win every time, this time...they stunk in the 3rd...plain and simple."
535248,young_one,2011-01-06 03:22:00,620,"Next yr... ""Tomorrow starts today"""
535249,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 03:24:00,3761,"What was it me or bigugli that you responded to the 2nd time lol.  Ah well guys, they did there best...or did they?  Until next time, enjoy the gold Russia, they were the better team in the end right."
535252,Grimace,2011-01-06 03:27:00,2020,So you did not invest one minute into the game bit still found it in your heart to flippantly say that the Canadian National Junior Hockey Team that won the silver medal stinks.  If only they had your class and heart maybe they would gave won Gold.
535254,Grimace,2011-01-06 03:27:00,2020,Both of you.
535263,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 03:35:00,3761," They didn't win, they are not champions but runner ups. They are a great team and I'm sure they will try twice as hard like the pens the year after they lost the cup...and I'm sure they deserve respect and they are great players...blah blah blah...Are they happy with 2nd, obviously not. They know they fell apart and did terrible and so do I.  Now time for beer, chicken fingers, and some quiet while I'm still home alone without the roommates...Good night fella's."
535267,uglyfish,2011-01-06 03:39:00,981," Sorry, but shame sums it up. That was horrible. And to correct u, they didn't win the silver... They were given the silver for losing the gold."
535269,Grimace,2011-01-06 03:41:00,2020,If only they had what you guys have maybe they would have won gold.  You guys are amazing.  You guys are an inspiration to us all.
535279,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-06 03:53:00,3761, That's a good way to look at it
535289,HTHM,2011-01-06 04:03:00,4082,t-minus 30 min to lockdown....
