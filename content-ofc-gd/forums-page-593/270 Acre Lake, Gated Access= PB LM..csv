535425,moxie,2011-01-06 17:09:00,1566,"I know theres ice out there but ........ Mid-summer, early morning, a foot and a half of water under the shade of an old Cedar Tree drooped over the shore. The water is like glass as I cast the Pop-R, reel in slack as the ripples fade, one twich and BANG!! Halfway to the boat she dives and obliterates the Med-Heavy Lightning Rod into three pieces. The rest of the battle was fought Mano a Mano. We've seen many and caught a few big fish there but this one is my personal best. Scale read 8 1/2 lbs. I wonder if shes put on any weight since.   moxie    "

535674,moxie,2011-01-07 01:46:00,1566," The water was a foot and a half deep. The cast dropped like a 3 pointer, nothing but net . It was one of those , ""Thats the spot, right there"" feel it in your gut bang-on casts. Luck had nothing to do with it.....at least it didn't in my head. hehehe. Cheers.   moxie."

535743,David Chong,2011-01-07 04:24:00,836,"Absolute GIANT! Nice fish, get her next year when she should be over 9! Cheers, Dave"
535755,moxie,2011-01-07 05:26:00,1566," No sir. For a small lake it is relatively deep. We've sounded its deepest spot at 94 feet . It also has all the classic attributes you could wish for. Weeds, deep and on the flats, a couple of rock shoals topped with grass, rock, rubble and wood piles, humps, islands, overhanging trees, dead falls and undercut banks and a deep main lake basin with a few Springs. Did I leave anything out? Oh ya.... BIG BASS! Just a lil' ole Lake with an unspoiled shoreline that sits in the woods at the end of a dirt road .   Species: Rock, Large and Small mouth Bass, Walleye, Lakers, Perch and Pumkinseed.    moxie."
536006,johnnyb,2011-01-07 19:31:00,3413,Wow.  Gated access...they must be Pearly Gates
