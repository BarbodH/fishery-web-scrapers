535210,Mattones,2011-01-06 02:51:00,587,"Toast, blew it!"
535212,Mattones,2011-01-06 02:51:00,587,Just embarrassing.
535217,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-06 02:54:00,4399,Wow talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory!  That`s as big of a collapse as I have ever seen!
535218,muddler,2011-01-06 02:56:00,623,Our boys didn't quit. They played well for 2 periods. The Russians just opened up in the third period as we ran out of gas.  They have NOTHING to be ashamed of. They gave it all.  muddler

535231,Pigeontroller,2011-01-06 03:06:00,2793,Those boys will make great Leafs someday...
535232,bigugli,2011-01-06 03:08:00,6138,I didn't have the heart to say it
535235,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-06 03:10:00,2690,OUCH!!!!!!!! Guess picking that team of 19 year olds paid off in the end.  What a heart breaker......
535236,BillM,2011-01-06 03:10:00,17367,"Brutal..  Talk about running out of gas and just rolling over.  Ah well, that's hockey."
535272,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-06 03:45:00,4399,"  Glad you said it Dax I was thinking the same but I did not want to be the first one to start the Leaf bashing for 2011,I promise to be a kinder and gentler Habsfan this year!!!"
535303,SBCregal,2011-01-06 04:25:00,688,"calling it a ""collapse"" doesnt really give justice to what the russian team did.  canada didnt lose the game, russia won it.  they were the better hockey team tonight.  canada played like hell for the first period, went up 3-0 and started to slow down and lay back and the russians took it away from them for it.   ryan"
535305,GBW,2011-01-06 04:27:00,8460,Correct.  But for some reason I thought this topic was about the ever so failing ARRRRRGGGGGOOOO'S....
