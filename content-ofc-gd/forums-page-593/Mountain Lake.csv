535724,Meely,2011-01-07 03:30:00,282,Give him a shout.....  http://www.grahamguiding.com/pictures.html  Let me know how it goes!!  Meely

I did drill a few holes out front of the cottage and was pleased to find an average of 8""thick ice. The warm spell that melted all the snow froze what was on top of the ice. I took a drive around and saw the guys setting up huts at the Red umbrella. Mountain had alot of open water at the inlet from 12Mile. Alot of open water, in fact, wherever there was any current on most of the lakes from Beech on down to Mountain. Give a call anyways, theres a smattering of huts on pretty much every lake. Hope this helps."

535773,chrispyke,2011-01-07 11:12:00,51,I spoke to Andrew Graham a couple times yesterday.  Huts are out.  i'm heading up Sunday with the boy.  If you go up Saturday...leave a couple of lakers !
535777,highdrifter,2011-01-07 11:59:00,2534,Just a heads up;  One line allowed per person one this lake.
535780,dheitzner,2011-01-07 12:06:00,314,Thanks for the replies!  I tried to get a hold of Andrew but couldn't reach him. Darcy
