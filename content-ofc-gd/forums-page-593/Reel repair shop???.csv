536032,nodie,2011-01-07 20:00:00,34,Anybody know where to get good service for reel repairs around Ottawa area?? Reel to reel is up for sale and are no longer accepting new reels/rods...  Thanks
536055,Terry,2011-01-07 20:48:00,14456,hope you find one  there are a few down this way you could mail them out but I am sure you want one close to home
