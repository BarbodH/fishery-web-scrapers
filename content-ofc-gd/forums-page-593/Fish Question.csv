536238,irishfield,2011-01-08 00:40:00,26272,"Geoff.. at least we now know all of the OFC'rs that don't have much to do in a day and their health is up to snuff... to be able debate what may become the longest thread in OFC history..  On the other hand we have a couple OFC members that are down and out. I won't say their names, as I don't have permission to make their situation's public, but we have one getting some bones fused together today. Another that damn near died this week from an allergy to the anti-infection medicine that they had him on, for the infection he's had in his leg for almost a year. Another Doctor saved his ass...  literally.. as while performing another procedure he found that he was just days away from death.  Maybe we could steer some energy from the police thread over to passing on good thoughts for these two regulars around here!"
