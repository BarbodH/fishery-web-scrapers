Hopefully many more pictures to come!These fish were caught 5 minutes from home in Durham region.

535246,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-06 03:21:00,140,"Perch photos or crappies will be next,maybe the next time we go out. I don't think I will put your mug in the shot though!I was looking at rich's post of perch and crappie with multiple pictures,those were awesome photos.Got to figure out how to download multiple photos!"
