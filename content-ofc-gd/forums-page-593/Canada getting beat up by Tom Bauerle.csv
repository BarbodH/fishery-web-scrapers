The man in charge of this expedition is Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham. Sir, John, hello there. Vice-Admiral Sir John Cunningham: Ah, hello. Well, first of all I'd like to apologize for the behaviour of certain of my colleagues you may have seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority... and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find tooth marks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up.

Here's an analogy that may put it in a better perspective for our radio friend and the people his call screeners put on the air (it's unlikely they'll read it though).  The World Juniors Hockey Championship put on by the IIHF is a bunch of college aged, world class athletes competing for a championship.   No different then what is going on south of the border right now with all the college football bowl games.  I watched the Ohio State/Arkansas game last night and I have to say what I saw going on in the stands was pretty much the same as described by the callers into this Buffalo radio station.  It's fans supporting their team and enjoying the event.  As a result some things do happen, like loud cheering and partying, which leads to other behaviour.  As a result there is some behaviour demonstrated that most people would not do if it were not for the emotion of the game."

Ive run into the definition of humble and pleasant in canadians........and done the same with americans.  Ive seen large groups of all of the above and seen individuals the same.
