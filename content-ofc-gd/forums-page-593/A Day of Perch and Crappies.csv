534805,Rich,2011-01-05 01:58:00,3927,"Drill a hole, catch a fish. That was today's strategy. Even if the hole was a foot away. Good mixed bag, plenty released. Kept 7 perch and a crappie. No pike bites all day, besides the 38"" that Rob caught and released before I got there.              "

535776,Rich,2011-01-07 11:52:00,3927,"I think you'd hate that experience nowadays Scott. Straight up fishing, none of that ""funny business"" anymore. And with the exception of this one trip (literally) we make damn sure 99% of the fish make it back down the hole."
535833,johnnyb,2011-01-07 14:50:00,3413,That pike is a beauty!  And the pannies aren't bad either...way to go
