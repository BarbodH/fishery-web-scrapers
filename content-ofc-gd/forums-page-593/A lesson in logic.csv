536134,Big Cliff,2011-01-07 22:40:00,6899,"Two Newfies,  Larry and Doug, are sitting at their favourite bar drinking  beer.  Larry turns to Doug and says, 'You know, I'm  tired of going through life without an education. Tomorrow I  think I'll go to the Community College and sign up for some  classes.'  Doug thinks it's a good idea and the two  leave.  The next day, Larry goes down to the college and  meets Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic  classes: Math, English, history, and Logic.  'Logic?'  Larry says. 'What's that?'  The dean says, 'I'll give  you an example. Do you own a weed  eater?'  'Yeah.'  'Then logically speaking,  because you own a weed eater, I think that you would have a  yard.'  'That's true, I do have a yard.'  'I'm not  done,' the dean says. 'Because you have a yard, I think  logically that you would have a house.'  'Yes, I do have  a house.'  'And because you have a house, I think that  you might logically have a family.'  'Yes, I have a  family.  'I'm not done yet. Because you have a family,  then logically you must have a wife. And because you have a  wife, then logic tells me you must be a  heterosexual.'  'I am a heterosexual. That's amazing,  you were able to find out all of that because I have a weed  eater.'  Excited to take the class now, Larry shakes the  Dean's hand and leaves to go meet Doug at the bar. He tells  Doug about his classes, how he is signed up for Math, English,  History, and Logic.  'Logic? ' Doug says, 'What's  that?'  Larry says, 'I'll give you an example. Do you  have a weed eater?'  'No.'  'Then you're a  queer.'"

536146,muddler,2011-01-07 22:52:00,623,"One of my neighbours has a weed eater that he has trouble turning off, so I guess he's on Viagra?  The other neighbour has two weed eaters, I thinks he's having  a relationship with the checkout girl in the grocery store  but his wife doesn't know.  Now I wonder what the difference is between gas, electric and battery weed eaters.  I love this logic.  muddler"
