535875,BIG FISH,2011-01-07 16:39:00,54,"got out to  one of my favorite little lakes for a few hours last night hoping to get a couple walleyes missed a really good bite right at dark and that was it but after it got dark i started to mark these fish coming half way up off bottom and give my minnow a bump then go back down. i figured it could only be one thing so put on a smaller jig and some maggots and BINGO got onto some nice slabs kept half a dozen of the big ones for a snack threw the rest back, no walleyes but i guess these will have to do   oh by the way all these pics were taken with the iphone   does a better job than my digital      this was the size of the throwbacks     last weekend got onto a few pike there small but fun to catch on the spoon in 30 fow went 3 for 3      "

535938,Rod Caster,2011-01-07 17:59:00,5784,Nice crappies... I wonder if you would have noticed them without the fish finder.
535985,johnnyb,2011-01-07 19:03:00,3413,Yeah...I think I'd trade those slabs for walleye....nicely done!

536066,aplumma,2011-01-07 21:12:00,6896,I have spent countless hours watching my electronics and from my earliest days of using a black and white flasher to my lss-1 unit of today I still flip the switch to the flasher mode to help me understand what I am looking at.   Art
