535494,centerpinFTW,2011-01-06 20:48:00,9,Very nice steelies! What happened to the one in the second picture? It looks like part of it's gill plate is missing.
535530,l2p,2011-01-06 21:32:00,346,"pretty cheap actually, im a one man team haha.  thanks guys, i dont know exactly what causes the gill plate deformation. ive seen many fish over the years with the same problem and have heard many theories but none ever proven. either way they all seem to be healthy fish."
