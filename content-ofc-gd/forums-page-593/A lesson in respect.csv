To me, grabbing every camera in sight and screaming something into it, and then receiving the trophy and immediately parading it past the Canadians is not respect for your opponent.  I understand there is a certain level of excitement, but for a while there it could have gone the other way.  I hope the returning players remember that for next year, it'll serve as extra motivation to return to glory on home soil."
535242,SlowPoke,2011-01-06 03:18:00,2984,"I have no problem with it at all, enjoy it fellas! Did you have a problem with the Canadian boys spawling all over the ice after scoring a goal?"
535251,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-06 03:26:00,0,they earned it.
535256,bigmac1984,2011-01-06 03:28:00,193," I absolutely agree they earned it, and Canada melted down, and it will go down as another good game in the rival that is Canada vs. Russia. We'll be back there next year, hopefully with a different colour around their necks. Should be a fair amount of returning players."
535257,Grimace,2011-01-06 03:30:00,2020,"I had no problem with it.  They were elated, excited and they worked for it. No sour grapes.  We have the best minor hockey program in the world and we will be back next year."
535258,TJQ,2011-01-06 03:32:00,7806,"Seems like they just wanted it more... can't fault them for that as far as Im concerned. I would have liked it to go the other way, but this will be a great boost for Russian Junior hockey."
535261,bigmac1984,2011-01-06 03:35:00,193,"Yeah this was just my opinion, a bit sour I guess at the result, but we will be there again next year. We do have the best program and it will boost others and make the competition better.  Sorry to have hit a nerve with some people, it was just my opinion."
535265,GoneFishin,2011-01-06 03:35:00,349,They clearly have a different values then Canadians IMO. When their anthem came on it looked like they were in the pub tying one on. But they worked hard for it so if that's how they want to celebrate then so be it.
535274,PikeMolester,2011-01-06 03:49:00,428,they r not canadian..they r russian immature kiddies. no doubt we sat back...but for a Canadian team...our goalies were not up to par
535275,irishfield,2011-01-06 03:50:00,26272,Sorry.. but the Canadian boys would have done exactly the same thing!
535278,fishinguypat,2011-01-06 03:52:00,547,... Apparently braces haven't been invented in Russia? Man there teeth were ugly!
535280,danc,2011-01-06 03:54:00,4677,They deserved it. I found nothing disrespectful in their celebration.
535282,bigugli,2011-01-06 03:58:00,6138,"A bunch of guys yelling into the camera such inflammatory things like ""Hi Mom"" or ""we are the best"". Nobody here on the English side of the world does that do they?"
535452,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 18:40:00,655,"They deserved it! The Canadians would have done the same, especially coming back from 3-0! It will be a big boost for Russian junior hockey for sure, congrats to them."
535460,myot,2011-01-06 19:04:00,131,I have no problem with the way they celebrated On the other hand chippy play and faking an injury is 100% disrespectful and needs to be taken care of by th IIHF the Russians are trying to turn our beautyful game into a cold game of soccer  Dan
535466,addy79,2011-01-06 19:24:00,573," there hockey players, bud..."
535468,addy79,2011-01-06 19:28:00,573,"The age of the players really showed in teh third, NO WAY professionals would fold up like a wet rag in the third no matter what pressure they faced, good learning experience for them down the road though.  the ruskies played great, they deserve to celebrate however they see fit. obviously there gonna go competely bonkers after that win, 5 un answered goals in the third against the worlds hockey power house...  dont hate!"
535470,Lunker777,2011-01-06 19:32:00,866,"AGREED !!!!!! One minute, he can barely stand on his own two feet, two guys carrying him off the ice.... 5 minutes later, its like nothing happened and he scores two goals ! The game against the Chezs with the "" hit to the head "" .... or hit to the chest that was perfectly legal, except the panzy was taken off by stretcher. Did anyone else see if he played the next game ? or was he ACTUALLLY hurt ?  hahah true.... but there was one point where they did a close up on the bench and there was one guy that was the FUGLIEST thing I have ever seen on the ice ! hahah he looked like a gremlin or something ! ) No offense to Russians or anything.... just that particular player ! hahaha  It was a VERY good game.... the better team ( in this game ) WON ! Plain and simple..... the Canadians are lucky that the same thing didnt happen with the Americans... but they came up with to little to late !  Better luck next year Canucks !"
535472,solopaddler,2011-01-06 19:34:00,8605,"An impressive feat by those young men especially so being on foreign soil and in front of a hostile crowd.  Kudos to them, let 'em have their fun they deserved it.  Seems the lads were kicked off a plane as well.  http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/international/article/917068--unruly-russian-junior-hockey-team-kicked-off-flight?bn=1"
535474,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-06 19:38:00,2690," Have you watched the Leafs much, the last seven years???"
535477,addy79,2011-01-06 19:45:00,573," hahhaha...its funny you say that, i swear i was gonna throw a leaf crack in there but chose not to."
535478,Lunker777,2011-01-06 19:48:00,866,"hahahah yea, they were to intoxicated to fly !"
