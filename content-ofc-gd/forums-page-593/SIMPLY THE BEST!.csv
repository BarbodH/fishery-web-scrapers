533033,Old Man,2010-12-30 23:40:00,822,Fun times Simon. He's just a few months younger than my latest grandson. I can't wait to get him out fishing on his next visit.
533041,limeyangler,2010-12-31 00:33:00,5204,"Once again, thanks for the kind words people, the response to this thread (without sounding to cheesy) is why i love this site, an extended family really.         Look forward to seeing a post with the wee lad/lass? sometime.    Thanks Joey, i love the little man sooo much it hurts sometimes, and yeah...i'm ridiculously proud    Yup, cant wait till summer almost, get him in the boat, but i aint gonna wish time to fast forward, just gonna enjoy every moment of now, he grows so quick, everyday he's doing something more grown up!    LOL..i cant help it RC    Thanks as always Corvy.    We were only out for an hour, but he loved every minute, especiallly the snomachine ride to and from.    Yeah, i really hope he continues to find amusement in the outdoors, he's royally screwed if he doesn't given where we live....lol   Thanks Paul, he loves any and everything with buttons on it.    The best non catching session by far for me!"
533042,limeyangler,2010-12-31 00:33:00,5204," Thanks GBW    Well i'm still looking forward to meeting up with you in the new year, not many of us NWO boys on this site...gotta stick together so to speak, so maybe one day your grandson and Jack can hit the ice together."
533061,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-31 01:30:00,1622,"Great report & there will be many more to come, looks like he's hooked Richard"
533117,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-31 02:43:00,203,Awwwww!!!!! That is just awesome Simon  He's so adorable & you two are going to have many wonderful fishing memories together.....One lucky boy to have such a great daddy like you
534755,moxie,2011-01-04 23:29:00,1566,"SWEET!! He looks like a Gamer. Brings back memories. Me fishing as tackle is being thrown overboard behind my back, one piece at a time. Priceless!!"
534839,limeyangler,2011-01-05 03:15:00,5204," Thanks Rich, certainly hope so....i'll just ease him into it so he does not get put off....there have been many good posts on here about how to first get kids into it, then keep them interested without boring them into hating it.    Thanks SM, i am biased...lol....but i have to agree..he's damn cute!     LOL...Moxie...i can totally picture that scenario, i'm pretty sure he's gonna be in the boat lots this summer....he talks about the 'bye-bye boat....all done....summer"" still...he loved the boat...just attention span and steadiness and mobility/safety were the issue last summer."
535010,Moosebunk,2011-01-05 20:49:00,3970,"I love how big kids heads are.  Great idea keeping the helmet on during the fishing.  My youngests first time... she could have fallen through a 10-inch hole, your little guy would be safe as the helmut would stop him. lol.  Great post Limey.  Enjoy the rest of the season."
535439,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 17:51:00,655,"Now that is awesome!!! Congrats, I can feel the excitement in your post  My son is now 23 months old, and I can't wait to experience what you just did!"
535522,johnnyb,2011-01-06 21:24:00,3413,Dude....that is fantastic   Truly warms my heart....can't wait to see him smash his first ice-eye
532679,limeyangler,2010-12-29 21:47:00,5204,"Hi all,  It wasn't planned but took my boy (21months old) ice fishing today for the first time. HE LOVED IT! He was fascinated by the ice auger drilling holes, loves riding with dad on the ""snowmean""...he cant quite say snowmachine. His little hands resting on my thigh while he's perched at the front to hold on is sooooo cooooool, 2 buddies out for a ride!  We went and checked out my buddy Lew's shack which he drove out boxing day, Jack thought that was awesome, he loved the little hatches for the ice holes.  We only stayed for one hour, and fished for a total of 20 minutes and caught nothing...who cares  , but nap time was fast approaching (for Jack) and lunch, although i had brought it with us was not gonna happen out there...he was way to excited to eat.  He cried a lot on the way home, partly because he was tired but also....in his own words ....""LAKE AGAIN....LAKE, SNOWMEAN AGAIN""!!! He did not want to leave!   Will have to get Mum to join us in the shack which is situated right over a prime walleye spot.   Here are some pics from this afternoon. I'll never forget today....ever!!!!                                                               "
532681,splashhopper,2010-12-29 21:50:00,2931,"He looks like a natural !   Congrats.... treasure it while it lasts... one day it ""ain't cool"" hanging out with your dad...  and sooner or later,, it's cool again.  waiting in between is the tough part.... and that's what FISHING BUDDIES are for"
532683,blaque,2010-12-29 21:55:00,2419,Looks like the luckiest kid in the world to me. Great pictures
532688,irishfield,2010-12-29 22:10:00,26272,"DANG simon.. I ALMOST wanna have another one ! lol  The day will be etched in your mind for ever... I can still remember vividly slapping a life jacket on our son, 25 years ago, and tying him to a tree in Kelso park in Milton to fish the reservoir."
532709,Terry,2010-12-29 22:50:00,14456,good stuff  and in years to come they will be great memories
532710,solopaddler,2010-12-29 22:55:00,8605,A milestone day for sure. Great to see Simon!
532716,Rustic-Fisher,2010-12-29 23:17:00,826,Thats Great!!!!  I am about a year away from this.
532720,Leecher,2010-12-29 23:30:00,7832,"Awesome Simon Those are the greatest times of all Little Jack is a natural   and some day, will be kicking your butt  I can guaranty it  My daughter and I had a similar time today.... got out to a new lake, met some good local people and got a skunking  But was the greatest couple of hours spent on the hard stuff and round 2 is coming up soon  Thanks for sharing those precious moments with us!!! Jacques"
532722,toca,2010-12-29 23:33:00,274,oh man not even two years old and already figured out how to use the fish finder.  puts me to shame.  anyways thanks for sharing.  todd
532724,skeeter,2010-12-29 23:35:00,1907,Now your fun begins. Enjoy. 
532726,misfish,2010-12-29 23:39:00,29133,"This one looks like a,Yes byes,they be bite,n soon.Laughter.    Thanks for Sharing Simon."
532775,limeyangler,2010-12-30 00:51:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies gang...i am one proud daddy today, his poor feet were frozen solid when i took his so called -30 boots off when we got home, he did not complain about that once...will have to be careful next time...especially since he was having so much fun he blocked out the pain of frozen digits!     Yup...your insights ring true, thats exactly how i was!    Dad feels luckier at the moment. But yeah, this is exactly what we moved here from England for.    It certainly was a great day(hour)    Yup, treasures for sure.    Seemed like forever coming !   Its great at this age eh?    Did you get any pics Jacques? Sure you'll get into them next time.    He was absolutely fascinated by the fishfinder, gonna have to get a cheap cuda for him to mess with.   Yah....its a rollercoaster ride being a dad for sure....LOVE IT!    Brian....that is my favourite pic too....he just looks so into the whole thing, it totally looks like he's sharing a joke with the boys, what he was actually smiling at was another snowmachine whizzing by."
532809,Leecher,2010-12-30 02:35:00,7832, No pics Simon.... sorry     but it was fully charged and ready I sure will keep at it thanks
532813,vinnimon,2010-12-30 02:48:00,2593,awesome simmon gotta love those first memorable moments.
532819,Fang,2010-12-30 02:57:00,1330,four most powerful words I know  TAKE A KID FISHING!!!
532828,Governator,2010-12-30 03:22:00,879,"That's just great.  I have a 16 month old, looking forward to the months ahead."
532835,ctdd2006,2010-12-30 04:04:00,531,  Awesome stuff!  My boy is nearing 5y/o and this is his third ice fishing season.  He and I both can't wait for Jan 1st around here!  Enjoy it Limey!
532837,Joey,2010-12-30 04:06:00,9122,"He is just adorable Simon, you must be so proud.  What an awesome day for you two  Joey"

532886,Rod Caster,2010-12-30 13:59:00,5784,The thread name says it all.  Had a good chuckle looking at the photos...so cute and daddy so proud
532894,corvette1,2010-12-30 14:27:00,1765,one proud daddy congrats
532902,Blue Lk,2010-12-30 14:54:00,337,"GOOD on Ya Simon ""Take them with you when they are young,& they will take you when you are old."" Looks like it was a GREAT DAY?"
532972,Cudz,2010-12-30 19:15:00,2652,"very cool.  Being the father of 3 girls, I don't quite have the same enthusiam over here.  Unfortunately for my kids it is a punishment when they misbehave.  ""If you don't smarten up you will go fishing with your dad.""  I have already had a few of those this year where there is an angry daughter in the back of the boat.  I really don't mind their punishment, gets me out on the water. lol"
532978,mercman,2010-12-30 19:37:00,7054,"absoluetly priceless Simon !!! he looks like a real pro, specially the one where he is examining the sonar returns times like that make all the rest worthwhile.  Happy New Year !!!  Paul  "
532984,Whopper,2010-12-30 20:13:00,2174,Absolutely the best non catching report I've read  Thanks for sharing
