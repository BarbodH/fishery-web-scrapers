535037,Pikeslayer,2011-01-05 21:38:00,1443,"It has been about 15 yrs since I was last ice drinking fishing. I've grown up a little bit since then and no longer have the urge to sit in a hut all day getting trashed   That said, I would really like to spend a day on the ice and actually put some energy into fishing but I have zero tackle for ice fishing. So.........I was wondering if anyone was interested in setting up a day on the hard water in exchange for a July/August day of LO salmon and rainbow (I launch out of Port Credit/Promenade). I have all the required tackle, gear and boat. You would just need to show up at the launch.  I live in Mississauga and would be willing to drive 3 hrs for a day trip (weather permitting). As well, any day of the week could work for me. If anyone is interested send me a pm accordingly.  Regards, Simon"

Just kidding, I've seen your post of le' chateau Skeeter and am looking forward to first class ice fishing. BTW, any friend of the Mercman is a friend of mine   I'll shoot you a pm tomorrow with my contact info. Cheers, Simon"
535073,OrangePeal,2011-01-05 23:16:00,37,"Simon, right behind catching those Lk O monsters, ice fishing is my favorite time of the year. I am working on a old Skidoo to get out in the middle but you are invited to join me on foot till then. I am not a perch kind of guy but as soon as Simcoe has enough ice for the lakers, I will be gone. Drop me a PM with your number and we can discuss meeting up for a trip.  PS. I spent 42 days hunting salmon this summer so I will pass on the offer of LkO fishing.  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
