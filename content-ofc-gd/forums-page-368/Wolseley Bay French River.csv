728769,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-10 19:52:00,602,"Awesome, good job. trophy size?"
728770,Rich Clemens,2012-09-10 19:55:00,3131,For me.... Probably.  For others .... Nah
728776,Spiel,2012-09-10 20:19:00,9065," It's an ice breaker Rich and a good start. Hope everyday sets a new PB. Have fun and say ""Hi"" to Patsy for me."
729421,bigcreekdad,2012-09-12 22:24:00,546,"Just returned from 8 days of fishing that area. Bass fishing for first four days was awesome. THen cold front came through, and bass fishing never ret'd to what it was. Pike fishing was mediocre, as it has been for all three trips this year. Had a big muskie follow a surface plug (actually created a big wake) last WEdnesday. THen....nothing til last night...really windy all day, but it dropped off around 7pm. decided on one last hour of fishing for the year up there. Third cast on a Top Raider.....wham!....47.5"" lunge. I'll post a pic when I get back to my home (drove to my cabin today, and my connection for camera is home- don't use a chip). WAs by myself, so netting was a bit tricky. Missed my first attempt and he then made a short run, and jumped....I almost died. Got him on my next attempt.  Great way to end the season."
729428,Rich Clemens,2012-09-12 22:51:00,3131,"Been windy a couple days now.  My usual spots were a little tough to hold.   Had one ski hit, but the hook- set missed it's mark.  Had another follow, so I know where they are."
729726,discophish,2012-09-14 03:59:00,392,"Was there today from 3 to 8.  We were in the black Princecraft Xpedition at the launch.  Lots of people at the lodge.  Fished hard for 5 hours, covering a lot of territory.  H2 had a big girl on for a short while, then the hooked popped.  One follower to the boat.  That was it for us.  Talked to a few groups at the docks before putting the boat up and the same thing today all around.  We were lucky enough to see a Bald Eagle fly over the boat.  Haven't seen one around here for a few years.  For those of you that are there for the week, good luck and get into some big'uns!"
729735,Rich Clemens,2012-09-14 10:13:00,3131,"Real heavy fog yesterday am that didn't lift until about 8:30am or so.  One small boat went out and made it as far as Totum point and stopped due to no visibility.  I heard they just fished right behind Totum point and hooked into one.   Believe they lost her before getting her boated. Not sure how big.   Heard of another being caught down he North Channel.  Not hearing much at all of big girls eing landed this week.  Should it surprise me as I have ever landed one here.  Seen quite a few over the years, but no commits."
729743,John,2012-09-14 11:34:00,2956,Sounds like a tough week Rich. Hope you do better next. Having said that the fishing is always great up there it's the catching that can be tough sometimes. Be safe......
727938,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-06 23:07:00,602,"Was just curious how many of us on this forum are going up too the French River this weekend, the wife and I are going up tomorrow til Monday for some camping and muskie! I'll be in a 16' Sylvan if anyone see's me. Going to be a little cold but that's alright. Geez, just checked the weather and it's going to be 11 with the 5 degree windchill on Sunday. Lovely."
727948,RickOnt,2012-09-06 23:29:00,669,Musky weather!!  Rick
727956,chris.brock,2012-09-06 23:54:00,4053,"I won't be up there, but I wish I was, I think this weekend will be prime for muskies give us a report when you get back"
727983,Rich Clemens,2012-09-07 01:03:00,3131,We'll be checking into Wolseley Lodge Saturday late afternoon and staying a week.  We're in a blue Tracker with two dogs.  Hope the big girls are a wee bit hungry.
728003,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-07 01:49:00,602,We are in the Fish Tales Campground
728013,Pigeontroller,2012-09-07 02:01:00,2793, How do you find the Lodge owner?
728035,wantabigone,2012-09-07 02:38:00,97,good luck
728072,Rich Clemens,2012-09-07 09:43:00,3131,"Then, if you are coming down Wolseley River to the bay, you will go right past us.  We are in cabin  1 - the one right next to the bridge.   We'll have to keep an eye out for you."
728073,Rich Clemens,2012-09-07 09:51:00,3131,"Harold and Ingrid have always been accommodating for us.  I'd have no complaints.  There have been times where Harold is busy or something else on his mind that folks may get brushed aside.   We don't go to the lodge much.  Most contact after we check in - is in passing. We're not the only ones in camp, so I can understand that.  They have been trying do upgrade the camp and cabins, a little each year.  Some cabins have been completely remodeled and really look nice inside.  Did not get up last year, so I'lll be curious if they did anything to the cabin we are in."
728077,Roy,2012-09-07 10:41:00,13728,"You guys have a great time up there and show us some pics when you get back! Rich, I think you're due for a 56 ."
728095,John,2012-09-07 11:54:00,2956," Personally I would just shout ""Harold""....."
728096,John,2012-09-07 11:56:00,2956," Hope that you and the girls have a great time. Will be up there in October so leave one or two big girls will ya, you seem to have them dialed in over the past couple of years."
728155,wkrp,2012-09-07 15:40:00,656,Going up on Monday for 4 days . Blue Lund Rebel
728353,bigcreekdad,2012-09-08 14:58:00,546,"I'm up at Crane's now. I have green on white Alumucraft with 60 Yam tiller....wave if you see me.  Been up since Monday.....first several days warm and calm....not good for casting for muskie. Spent a lot of time on bass....excellent this year! One woman in camp has hooked large muskies twice this week drifting worms....lost both, but both were at boat side at least twice so they got real good looks.  I raised a  large muskie on a topwater after dinner Wednesday.....it created a large wake right up to the boat....I did figure 8, but it did not hit. Why do the fish gods do this to you?  Rainy and windy today....staying until rain quite....I can take rain or wind, but as a near senior citizen, not both. A nap will do just fine.  Good luck to those coming up."
728378,Raf,2012-09-08 17:10:00,3495,"say hi to ed, and take a look up at 'muskie boys' entries above your head as you're walking out onto the dock through testosterone alley."
728423,F_ast,2012-09-08 22:52:00,154,I may be heading up mid week; maybe even the weekend.... All depends on my shipements this week.
728491,Rich Clemens,2012-09-09 11:32:00,3131,We are here too.   Just about ready to start out.
728615,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-10 02:15:00,602,"The wife and I just got back from there, we cut our trip short. Friday rained hard all day, Saturday much of the same. I was shunked and she caught 2 very small Pike. Not a Muskie to be seen. Wonder if the cold front turned them off. Good Luck Rich."
728635,Rich Clemens,2012-09-10 12:12:00,3131," Glad you made it back home.  Although we met out on the water, I was looking for you guys coming in last evening.  Saw your boat was not at the dock when we got back, thought you may still be out.  Not a fish tone seen by us on Saturday evening and nothing yesterday either.  May take a couple days for things to settle down.   Heard one was caught near the North Channel, but no details on size, nor if it was someone in camp.   Heading out soon, waiting for the fog to lift a bit."

728662,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-10 14:24:00,602,"Yeah, I was hoping we could speak again, and share some fish caught, the rain and the cold kinda beat us down and I was expecting better fishing. Hopefully the warmer weather helps you this week."
728702,Rich Clemens,2012-09-10 17:05:00,3131,We broke the skunk this am.    Beautiful weather up here now.
728717,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-10 18:03:00,602,Muskie or Pike?
728734,Rich Clemens,2012-09-10 18:29:00,3131,Pike.  1/2 inch less than my PB.
