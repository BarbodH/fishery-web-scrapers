729019,GreenCanada,2012-09-11 13:53:00,375, I came here to say this very thing.
729031,Dabluz,2012-09-11 14:51:00,701,"Smalleye....yes that's a good one.  Now imagine ""brooskies""!  Both fish are very agressive however brook trout are much more agressive.  Brook trout live in cool clean water and taste great.  Musky get very large.  Both fish jump and both look great.  Also, brooskies has the same name as ""brewskies"" which is another favourite among fishermen."
729049,Bernie,2012-09-11 16:14:00,3190,A walleye without gills....
729056,Christopheraaron,2012-09-11 16:40:00,3525," Nice, Very nice."
729130,fishnsled,2012-09-11 20:39:00,3520, I'm good with that Bernie.  Pretty tough to argue with the brook trout. Mother nature did a fine job there.
729132,mike rousseau,2012-09-11 20:44:00,4661,Walleye.... There great just the way they are...

729234,nkuchmak,2012-09-12 01:30:00,25,"Im going to join in and say I agree with Brook Trout being some of mother natures best work. If only they could be caught in huge numbers in larger sizes....wait a second they do...Arctic Char is as close as you can get without a science lab!  But since we are playing Dr Frankestein,  Im going to take the airborne ability and strength of the Tarpon along with the dental work of a goliath Tigerfish. You guys seen these things????"
729239,Steve,2012-09-12 01:42:00,2075,"The Brown Trout.  as beautiful and majestic as the brookie, but they get 30lbs."

728863,jedimaster,2012-09-11 00:29:00,3472,"Ok, so here goes this should be interesting... Take any two fish and combine them to make a super fish... for eating, catching whatever...  Rules.  1) 2 Fish 2) Can't combine salt, salt with fresh or brackish etc.. so No Great White Crappie, or Flying Muskie 3) You have to explain what traits you would want to be in the final fish 4) You can submit one ontario only strain coontaining ontario fish and one worldy fish containing any fish from around the world  I'll start... Ontario - Crapski I am thinking Crappie and Muskie... Taste, reproduction rate and schooling characteristics of Crappie, Muskie for the size and fighting ability.  World - Salmark I am thinking a Great White and a Pacific Salmon. Size, Power looks of the shark, mixed with the breeding habbits of a Salmon...
