729367,iFish4real,2012-09-12 17:42:00,386,I was wondering if anybody will go walleye fishing this weekend and would like to share what depths could fish be found this time of the year on inland lakes north of French River... Thanks!
729369,Rod Caster,2012-09-12 17:44:00,5784,I'm going tomorrow night. Starting at 4 FOW over rocks in very tannin-colored water. From there I'll work 8-15 FOW and expect them to be there with the recent colder temps.
729372,Joeytier,2012-09-12 18:02:00,3990,Should definitely still be around their summer haunts.  Green weed if you can find it...rock flats if you can't.
729390,mike rousseau,2012-09-12 18:59:00,4661,However deep the weed edges are... That's where there will be active fish...
729520,singingdog,2012-09-13 09:59:00,1047,"Once it's dark, they have been right up on the weedbeds in 3-6 fow. Before dark, I have been finding them around 10-12 fow."
