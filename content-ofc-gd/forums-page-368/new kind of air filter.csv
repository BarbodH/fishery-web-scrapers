I took the lid off the air filter to find he had no filter but he did have a nicely dried out pike(about 2 lbs) I informed him ......he just shrugs his shoulders Would you like me to replace the pike with an actual air filter........no that's ok .....you sure....... ya that truck runs fine without one..........any small rock will get sucked into the engine and be crushed up........................ Oil change complete.......out the door he goes..........."
