I really want to try and practice my drop shot technique for smallies and perch.  Any tips?  Fishing the east end, Mohawk Point, Port Maitland."

729664,Steve Piggott,2012-09-13 23:52:00,196,Sunday is looking good wind wise. Try shallow 10 to 15 FOW in the morning or if there is a good chop.Move deeper midday. 20 to 30 FOW. Tubes and Drop shot have been working well. Try jerk baits in the shallows also.I will be out all weekend to the west Mohawk Point.
