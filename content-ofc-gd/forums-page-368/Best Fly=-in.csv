729112,d.thibeau,2012-09-11 19:29:00,10,Hello everyone. Looking for some advice. Looking for a good fly-in for next year for a group of 4 -6. Only considerations are as follows:     Any advice/suggestions are welcomed.    Hammer

729201,wantabigone,2012-09-12 00:12:00,97,pretty much anything out of Nakina is good to be honest for numbers. Size is a different issue. There are less good lakes with big fish at a cheap price. Of course there is always the chance of getting a big one on a lake not known for big 'uns.
729222,solopaddler,2012-09-12 01:04:00,8605,If you want an informed response you have to be a little less vague.  Exactly how much do you want to spend and how far do you want to drive from Hamilton?  Great fishing is pretty much a sure thing flying in.
729385,Toad Hunter,2012-09-12 18:44:00,261,I hear the sutton river produces unreal numbers of fish
729418,SirCranksalot,2012-09-12 21:56:00,3291,  Do you happen to know anybody who has gone there lately?
729438,Toad Hunter,2012-09-12 23:24:00,261,Not personally but after that great read I might just reach out
729560,torco,2012-09-13 15:01:00,656,Yeah I have put the sutton on my bucket list now..
729565,SirCranksalot,2012-09-13 15:12:00,3291,I'm gonna need a bigger bucket!!

729658,fisherman7,2012-09-13 23:34:00,325,"Speaking from experience - you will get what you pay for. Nothing like crappy fishing with crappy boats, motors and cabins to ruin your trip."
729663,workwear,2012-09-13 23:43:00,592,ive always been intrigued by this fly in type of adventure....and now reading mike's epic report has put this need in high gear....thanks mike!!  but ive always wondered ...what would one need to spend on a decent to good outfitter...  i guess you do get what you pay for.....  just curious...
729685,adempsey,2012-09-14 01:07:00,1498," I am pretty sure you can fly to an outpost with sound boats/motors, decent service, reasonable accommodations and excellent fishing for $700-$725 per person.   I'd say the good majority of outposts run $850 to $900 per person though.  There are of course more deluxe outposts as well that run over $1000 per person.   Also, the distance you need to fly will play a BIG role in the cost.   A trip to Eddies North is about $1500 per person, but that's most likely because it's a relatively long flight (1.5 hours or so?)."
729797,chris.brock,2012-09-14 17:35:00,4053,"Parks Fly-in out of Hawk Junction (this side of Wawa) is well priced ($700 for a week), and has some great camps with good walleye and pike fishing, the drive is less than 10 hours from the GTA which is alot easier (and cheaper for fuel) than the 14 plus hours to Nakina. I've used them twice and had great trips with no disappointments, great outfitter Mike would be the guy to talk to about specifics  http://www.outpostcamps.com/"
