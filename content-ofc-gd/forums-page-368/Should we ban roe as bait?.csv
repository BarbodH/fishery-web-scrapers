729209,Steve,2012-09-12 00:26:00,2075,BILLM  You want to hear from the lake guys?  SURE!  BAN ALL USE OF ROE AND BRING DOWN THE LIMIT IN THE LAKE TO TWO!  WAS THAT LOUD ENOUGH?!!!!
729210,Steve,2012-09-12 00:31:00,2075,"oh, and bill, milking eh!  ya, we've seen that.  5% of angler collecting loose eggs while 95% of anglers are squeezing the internal organs trying their hardest to get that ""loose"" roe flowing!  once squeezed, the angler then throws the fish back in the water, feeling like a champ! They got their eggs and relased the fish.... ya right. A true sportsman."
729246,ch312,2012-09-12 02:13:00,1590," x2   i'd support a ban. i can think of the positives, but can't think of a single negative thing about such a ban."
729380,aplumma,2012-09-12 18:25:00,6896,Once again this topic has run its course with the same outcome.  Art
728605,Snidley,2012-09-10 01:31:00,620,"The authorities in Ohio determined that the disease potential of roe was worth banning it. It's a small reason IMO as it the real damage that roe harvesting does is both scientific, killing off the future for hackers to get bait and optics such as the overall loogan behavior it breeds on rivers around the GTA. You know, slitting fish, chumming, stripping fish and throwing them back, constantly seeking fresh eggs no matter how damaging it is. Literally planning egg trips to resupply yourselves. And then complaining when other ""anglers"" do it on your tribs in a way you guys determine is ""not right"". What a crew, sportsmen all."
728610,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 02:09:00,1633,Not even worth the time.  Have fun at Mountsberg.
728612,Canuck2fan,2012-09-10 02:12:00,1444,"Should the gutting of females just for roe, then the carcass being left on the river bank be stopped ABSOLUTELY!!! How does one do that though? Banning roe would be the same as having marijuana be illegal and we all know how well that is working.  As long as roe is legal I will use it and not feel the least bit guilty about it despite the rantings of others.  As I have said before sometimes the catch and release guys do a lot more damage to the fishery when they go out with their 2lb leaders and thrash 20 fish a day 15 times or more a year. As if fighting the hens for 20 minutes when they are already stressed from low water and spawning isn't harmful? Then they have to get that picture of the fish just so along side their $600.00 pin reel with the snazzy pink line. I doubt many of those ""released"" fish contribute much in the way of spawning eggs that mature into adult fish after that. Another thing I see HUNDREDS of C and R guys fishing with roe that they replace after every 5th cast where are they getting their roe? Some of have even been brazen enough to suggest that I or someone I am fishing with put a hen back to help conserve the fishery.... they walked away when we asked about how they came by the 50 or so sacs we had seen them using that morning.  So I fail to see how a person who catches and harvests maybe 5 fish a year one or two of which might be females is doing more harm to the fishery, than the type of C and R guys I see out there...."
728621,ChrisK,2012-09-10 02:33:00,2772,"Personally I could do without roe if need be. Catch lots of fish on fly's and its more challenging as well. Been tieing stones,sucker spawn and a few other patterns for the last two weeks awaiting for the arrival of the first salmon in my trib followed up by  the steel. I figure with all the rains and the cooler temps in the forecast it shouldn't be long now. Pretty exiting time of the year....  Cheers!"
728634,kemper,2012-09-10 12:10:00,2232," You keep bringing up the Oak, which is a put and take fishery.... That huge dam with the lake above it a mile from lake Ontario kinda puts a damper on any successful spawning.  I'm not saying its a reason to kill em all, but doesn't it make sense to harvest stockers that wont spawn over wild fish that have a chance?  Just a thought"
728641,torco,2012-09-10 12:59:00,656,"I personally don't use roe anymore, have been finding it more challenging to catch fish on the fly. I would support a roe ban or some other proposed ideas like C&R only periods in the fall. The problem is even if new rules are enacted we need more resources for enforcement."
728642,torco,2012-09-10 13:01:00,656,On a side note. I was vising my mom yesterday and strolled down to her local creek and to my pleasant surprise I saw a wonderful amount of salmon running up stream. And no one else was around   So this large group of fish was basically in the clear and should get a good opportunity to spawn since most of the riverbank they were heading into is more difficult to access.
728649,BillM,2012-09-10 13:28:00,17367,"  Be quiet, we all know those fish at Burt make that 70ft jump into the spawning waters!!!!  I love the anti-roe crowd, relying on their own opinions instead of facts.   I'd love to know their stance on the 5 fish limit out in the lake..  You want to talk about impact to the fishery?  lol"
728665,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 14:29:00,2710,"You do realize the irony of your statement here, right?   And to clarify my position. I gave up steeleheading years ago because of the hero attitudes. My only support for the ban on roe comes from trying to stop the lugans who slit and waste fish. To me it seems like the easiest, cheapest solution."
728668,torco,2012-09-10 14:34:00,656,  The 5 fish limit is ridiculous...another change that should be made.
728682,GreenCanada,2012-09-10 15:37:00,375,"I personally never use roe, so I wouldn't be too upset if they decided to ban the use of it. It would decrease the number of fish that are gutted for roe and then left to rot. Yes, I realize that some of the targeted fish are going to die anyways, but I don't think it is an ethical practice. If you are planning on consuming the fish and it happened to have eggs, then that's fine, use the eggs."
728685,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 15:41:00,1633, All Salmon die after they spawn.  I am not saying I agree with the gutting. There will be rotting fish in the river regarldess of people gutting.
728687,12footspringbok,2012-09-10 16:10:00,459,I voted no. It wouldn't bother me too much if it was banned though...  The way I see it the problem is with enforcement.  Another point I'd like to bring up is that supposidly some of the slit for roe carcasses you see aren't necessarily for bait but for food. Apparently some people like to eat the sperm sacs too or so I've been told...
728692,jedimaster,2012-09-10 16:29:00,3472,Is it not already illegal to let fish rot that is edible? So how would banning roe prevent anyone from harvesting roe and letting the fish rot? Or am I missing something?
728695,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 16:36:00,2710,Peer pressure/shame. If i see someone breaking a law Im going to mention it to them/call tips. Chances of catching someone one slitting fish are small. Catching them fishing with roe is much more likely to happen. Yes its punishing the ethical fisherman for the few lugans but we already do that with most fishing regs anyway.
728704,Loadman,2012-09-10 17:43:00,63,"if I am gonna take row it will be from the US side where the cookie cutter fish are 'produced' and not the naturals we tend to take for granted..... I got no problem taking row from the zombies that lurk there..... I paid for them with my NY state license and I will harvest them... unless of course its not a clipper... sorry if you see that being a problem, but whats better me taking legal fish or a guy with a ""Michigan Cricket"" and a shark rod ripping fish?"
728706,jimmer,2012-09-10 17:55:00,2730,"Atlantics don't die after spawning, do they?"
728722,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 18:10:00,1633,Some will make it back after spawning but most of them will die just like the Pacific Salmon.
728735,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 18:31:00,2710,Not to confuse anything but thats because its a trout
728771,nkuchmak,2012-09-10 20:00:00,25,"The argument that a roe ban would never be a worthwhile regulation due to a limit of law enforcement is nuts even if it may be true. All we have are our regulations to protect the fishery and we have to have faith in them. Almost all our fishing regulations are little to never enforced on a regular basis but the impact that changes have, such as slot sizes and limit changes have a positive effect on the fishery because the majority of the fisherman follow the rules and respect the resource.  Im sure back in the 50's when stringers and stringers of walleye were being pulled out of nipissing for the table, if you explained to one of those fisherman what a slot size was he would have a comment along the lines of...it could never be enforced so its a bad idea.  The problem with the use of roe is that even a catch and release angler is still killing a fish to catch a fish."
728808,danc,2012-09-10 21:56:00,4677, Now stop that. That makes too much sense.
728946,Aaron Shirley,2012-09-11 03:08:00,655,"I enjoy using roe. I have been using it for over 30 years and enjoy the process of roe and tying it up to go steelheading. It is a bit nostalgic for me. I also enjoy using artificials as well.  Banning roe will do nothing to help the fishery. We have an incredible fishery on Lake Ontario currently that can easily attain selective harvest. I only keep a couple fish a year for roe, and I release almost every other trout I catch. I don't even need to collect roe this year. I don't think I am damaging the steelhead or brown fishery by keeping a couple fish lol. Yes, there are some roe hogs out there, but many just collect what they will use.  I also enjoy fishing the salmon derby along with tens of thousands of other salmon anglers. Without the derby, there would be a lot less anglers going out for salmon and nothing put into the salmon resources on Lake Ontario. The salmon fishery is currently the best it has been since the hayday in the 1980's. It is a thriving fishery that many enjoy. Since the rule changes a few years ago, not a lot of salmon are killed in the GOSD now. I killed one salmon this year to weigh in. Most do.Like I said, the fishery is thriving, and the salmon derby helps the fishery, not damage it.  Just because you have a different elitist attitude Paul, it doesn't make the rest of the world ""dicks"", as you called many OFNers here.  I understand you have different ideas, but you are not helping your cause by calling a lot of other people names. You got kicked off Spoon Pullers for this very thing.  Many people enjoy fishing with different methods and tactics that are responsible anglers despite what you think. The bad apples out there will always be bad apples.  All the best,  Aaron"
728948,BillM,2012-09-11 03:22:00,17367," Gotta explain this one to me chief, I'm shaking my head.  Or are you assuming all fish that are milked die?"
728949,solopaddler,2012-09-11 03:23:00,8605,"Well said Aaron and your post made me realize a particular fact which as far as I know has never been mentioned in any of these tiresome discussions.  I use roe quite often myself, and like you may not have to harvest a fish this year because I already have enough.  Why? Simply put because I don't chum. The biggest problem most here have with roe harvesting is the indiscriminate slaughter of salmon every fall.  Seeing dozens upon dozens of fish with slit bellies along the banks does nothing good to promote the use of roe as bait.  Who actually needs or uses this much roe? Well, there's two culprits at work here. One, the lowlifes who harvest mass quantities for ilicit sale, and two the guys who constantly throw gallons of chum into a hole attempting to induce a hit.  While I'm not against chumming, the way most of these knobs do it is ridiculous.  If you think there's 6 fish in a hole, throw 5 eggs, not half a gallon.  In any case I neither chum nor sell roe illegally and I'd hazzard a guess that most roe users don't either."
728962,nkuchmak,2012-09-11 04:04:00,25," I will admit I have never milked a fish. However, I have watched it done for conservation purposes and can say that at the very least, it causes unnecessary stress to an already exhausted fish and if not done correctly has potential to cause harm and only for the benefit of obtaining bait to catch more fish. I would be very curious to see actual data on survival reports of these stressed out fish being milked by non professionals but I'm not going to guess. Maybe my last statement may have not taken the ""milking"" of fish into account, and leaned towards the crowd that harvests fish for roe (i.e. most i see on the river) but i just don't understand why someone who takes the conservationist role can then go ahead and strip a large spawning female of future generations of fish.   These are some great questions being asked on this topic and we all have different opinions and roe ban or not,its important to talk it out cause the only thing that is going to make our fisheries better are the fisherman who enjoy it. Just imagine, if those P3TA retards find out fish are being slit open and left to rot...well the future of our beloved sport would have some steep opposition."
728425,glen,2012-09-08 23:02:00,2641,If most people want it maybe that will be the way it is.
728426,misfish,2012-09-08 23:07:00,29133,"Glen,I   have a large wooden spoon,want to borrow it? LMAO"
728432,kemper,2012-09-08 23:27:00,2232,"Wouldn't bother me at all if it was banned. Until then, I'll continue to selectively harvest 1 or 2 fish a year that are edible and provide roe."
728433,davey buoy,2012-09-08 23:42:00,5505,"As long as you are allowed to keep your limit,how much more can you control?."
728437,kemper,2012-09-08 23:54:00,2232,"Another thought - I would 100% back a no-kill on the rivers from August to 4th Sat in April.  Of course i would also support no kill fishing period, for every species, but I realize that isnt a popular idea."
728447,MCTFisher9120,2012-09-09 00:30:00,3761,"Not a river rat myself but why ban roe? It's plentiful, can't be invasive in transport like baitfish, crawfish etc...and takes personal time to cure, tie, etc. Not to mention it's in the fish these guys catch and with proper legal harvest your entitled i would think. What is not right is taking roe and leaving fish dead on bank. Perhaps reasoning for banning as that is a sight everybody see's on the shores of creeks.   Tightlines,  MTBF"
728450,spincast,2012-09-09 00:41:00,3279,  x2. No need to keep when they are are running to spawn.
728451,rocheleauc,2012-09-09 00:43:00,205," This is true, and if banning roe would end this I'd be 100% for it."
728464,Sinker,2012-09-09 01:58:00,8692,"I voted yes, just to tie it up  S."
728470,Tdel,2012-09-09 02:35:00,393,"I think if you banned roe, the people who are taking the roe now and leaving the fish on the shore would not change. They would do the same thing over and over again. Only people it would affect would be the ones who use roe and follow the laws/regulations.  When does a regulation stop poachers from doing what they do?  Laws and regulations only affect honest people.  So yeah, lets put another regulation on the backs of honest people and let the ""do-gooders"" stick out their chests and brag about what they accomplished by banning roe. Probably the same people that want the gun registry back."
728480,nkuchmak,2012-09-09 04:10:00,25,"This is always a hot topic...  I agree that Poachers are going to do what they are going to do...law or no law but personally I would be all for a ban on roe and here are a few instances I have come across that I would see a ban as having a positive effect.  Last year I witnessed a guy with two fat hen browns on the bank on a Lake O Trib. I commented that it looked like he had a successful day which he grinned ear to ear explaining to me that him and his fishing partners came specifically to that creek because they needed to stock up on brown roe and would now have enough for the winter season. He explained that it works much better than salmon/rainbow roe. Sounds ridiculous but i have heard this many time before and well yes he was well within his legal limits taking those fish, I have to wonder how many people specifically target a species or system solely for the purpose of harvesting eggs.  Another time I was flyfishing for rainbows on my favourite Gbay river and I hooked up with a nice bow. The angler nearby was nice enough to assist me in landing a 7 lb female chromer and commented that because I was fly fishing, could he take the fishes roe because he needed some. I explained that I was not planning on keeping the fish and handed him a few yarn flies instead.  While no laws were being breached, I believe it comes down to selective harvest. True these fish could also have been taken for the purpose of eating but we all know it is better to harvest the smaller juvenile fish for eating like most do with bass walleye etc. All these fish were above average size spawning females and wild fish at that which we need in our systems. Fishing roe really comes down to the fact you have to kill a fish to catch a fish. A ban might not solve all our problems but really any more protection we can get on our rivers the better even if it does upset some peoples routine methods of catching fish."
728481,Ron,2012-09-09 04:16:00,1683,I would agree with banning of roe but of course the limit would have to be dropped on the great lakes to a limit of 2 first.
728484,Musky or Specks,2012-09-09 04:34:00,2710,"But you see they wouldn't be able to fish with it. I don't see people using baitfish in Algonquin Park or people using organic bait in the no bait sections of the Credit,Whiteman's or the Grand. Why, because its an obvious violation of a fisheries act. Eventually roe collection would become a useless effort. You don't see this happening where roe is already illegal BC and US states on the west coast."
728489,solopaddler,2012-09-09 10:52:00,8605, Under those circumstances alone I'd agree to a roe ban as well.
728492,Christopheraaron,2012-09-09 11:50:00,3525,"Ya, I guess I would, there are plenty of plastic roe imitators and there are glo bug flies."
728493,ecmilley,2012-09-09 11:55:00,2163,"must be september, what's the point it's a natural and productive bait being used primarily in a put and take fishery to what? stop the few poachers out there snagging salmon woop dee doo"
728498,moxie,2012-09-09 12:20:00,1566,   Yup. More rules. More incessant finger wagging from those who might just lack the cerebral capacity to leave well enough alone.
728500,Rich,2012-09-09 12:35:00,3927, I see people breaking those laws often in the spots you mention. Whitemans being the worst.
728515,hendrix,2012-09-09 15:21:00,61,"2 years ago I found a dead female salmon full of eggs, washed up on the shore after a big storm. Sure it didn't smell or look great, but I harvested those juicy stinky eggs. And it was enough for my dad and I to float fish for the next 2 years, almost. No fish harmed, those eggs worked well, everyone's happy."
728519,Snidley,2012-09-09 15:57:00,620,"One of the little known ""facts"" about roe angling is that roe IS an ""invasive"". Roe carries disease and that disease transmission (VHS in Ohio's case), not conservation, was the reason that Ohio banned roe angling 3 or 4 years ago. This is particularly the case when the really selfish hackers start chumming with roe. Inevitably they use old or stinky roe for chum and stinky old roe is contaminated with bacteria, that's what makes it stinky. This  is why one cures roe with an anti bacterial like Borax. Bronte Creek used to be a great Brown river but over the years the roe crowd have stripped out almost all of the Brown females, and now, no browns. The lugans at the 'Shwa did the same thing and any guess why Ontario tires get slashed at the Oak in New York State. Brown roe raiders that take eggs and toss the fish. Roe angling is the bane of steelheading and the guys that do it are the leading perpetrators of anti conservation behavior followed closely by cash trollers who must have derbys to find fishing entertaining. A pox on both groups of dicks."
728561,desship,2012-09-09 21:36:00,96,Ban it if this is an example 
728563,BillM,2012-09-09 21:44:00,17367,"Snidley, I'd love to see some facts that state Bronte was a great brown fishery and because of people taking the big females home for roe, it's now been decimated.  I love some of the 'info' you pull out of your rear end, lol!"
728590,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 00:29:00,1633," Yea really, doesn't seem to be a shortage of browns when I was fishing there last fall lol.  I take it he wouldn't know really with his comment about river and derby fisherman."
728592,Snidley,2012-09-10 00:41:00,620,"Bronte was not good, it was the best at least of the west end tribs and everybody knew it hence the efforts to catch and strip browns by the roe crowd (ie you guys like you fellows). Now there's always the Oak and the other Lake O NY tribs you fellows frequent on egg trips. Like I said lame almost to the extent of trot lines and crickets (also defended, even legal, in their time)"
728598,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 00:55:00,1633,Do you forget about all the rotting salmon and roe that is left on the shore and streams due to natural and the slaughter fest. Amazingly it actually is what feeds some fish in the rivers. I am sure that the rotting fish have bacteria in it to.  And to think it is a natural cycle that has been happening for ever.
