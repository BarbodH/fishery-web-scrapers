728755,kickingfrog,2012-09-10 19:21:00,8333,This is not my preferred colour but these were reduced to $14.45 so I grabbed two with the intention to paint one if not both.  9 inch Grandma   My first thought is cream or silver sides and a dark back.  Thoughts and input welcomed.
728760,fishnsled,2012-09-10 19:34:00,3520," x2.  I got a crazy colour of spoon for Lake Ontario suggested a few years ago and bought it. Sat in my spoon tray till this summer, wonder why I waited so long. It out produced every other colour of spoon I put out there. Went on the hunt for more of them and found them in one store and cleared them out.  If painting, I'd go with a perch or walleye pattern. Silver and black combo sounds good as well."
728761,mike rousseau,2012-09-10 19:37:00,4661,Nothing wrong with that color...  I've caugh lots of musky on similar color patterns...  Actually I have a lire with the same pattern only smaller spots and it is in my top 10

728791,Fisherman,2012-09-10 21:01:00,7201,For a second I thought you were going to give Grandma a face painting while she was nodding in the rocker.
728796,BucktownAngler,2012-09-10 21:25:00,582,thats a sweet colour. ill take it if you dont want it
728802,GBW,2012-09-10 21:43:00,8460,that's a weekend thing...
728807,esoxansteel,2012-09-10 21:55:00,1307,"Love the colour, Take it to Balsam, and she will have teeth marks in 10 minutes"
728814,kickingfrog,2012-09-10 22:14:00,8333,"Ok, I'll leave one alone and maybe just doctor the other a little. I did buy two jakes that were fish like in pattern and colouring.  The plan is for a Lac Seul monster, or two, to eat 'em."
728816,aplumma,2012-09-10 22:16:00,6896,I once painted Grandma and couldn't sit down for a few days...  Art

728834,cheaptackle,2012-09-10 22:55:00,849,"Like others I had my doubts when I opened this post - wondered if a typo or a few words were missing (painting grandma's house, portrait, car etc.) Use 'em before ya paint 'em! You might be saving yourself a bit of effort when you find they work best as they are, and you can always paint later if they don't.  Michael"
728839,Handlebarz,2012-09-10 23:08:00,3790,Yep keep em awesome for stained water here also great for any body of water that's tea stained.
728840,davey buoy,2012-09-10 23:15:00,5505,"I had always thought that lures were painted a certain color or design because they were tested and worked in certain conditions. You just have to find the right conditions I would think. Short of making your own or getting a blank ,than painting it. Give it a try first as recommended."
728864,aplumma,2012-09-11 00:33:00,6896,Hand painting something that resembles the local forage can in most cases make for a more productive lure.   Art
728943,John Bacon,2012-09-11 03:03:00,3277," Yeah, but ""worked"" for manufacturers means that it was removed from the shelf and carried to the cash register"
728974,chris.brock,2012-09-11 08:45:00,4053,"A Lac Seul muskie? ummm, tasty, or walleye?"
