727618,GreenCanada,2012-09-05 23:18:00,375,I'm speechless after seeing that brookie. I can't wait to see how the trip went.  Cheers
727621,bucktail,2012-09-05 23:27:00,1857,Your killing me here!!!!
727645,Whopper,2012-09-06 00:28:00,2174,Looking forward to your full report Mike  Couldn't help but thinking what you were into while I was watching a few moose and caribou at one of your old stomping grounds
728565,HarryBB,2012-09-09 21:53:00,13,"OK - We were right behind you .... and had a very different experience.  No Polar Bears except by the pick-up point.  What we did have in ten days on the river was great fishing the first few days and slightly high water - then - experienced three days of solid - in more ways than one - cold rain, 50 mile an hour winds and finally a flooded little sticks landscape with record high waters for this time of year.  With water already high we ended up scratching out alder real estate to camp and had to move to higher ground twice one evening with hypothermia a very real possibility.  It was so wet and windy and cold I didn't even shoot a minute of video.  Mike V. said it was the highest water he had ever seen after speing breakup.  Was that you leaving all that great firewood behind?"

728567,HarryBB,2012-09-09 21:55:00,13,PS:  I forgot to mention - my pickup brokedown north of TB on Friday and I'm still stuck in Duluth waiting to get into a repair facility.  
728568,solopaddler,2012-09-09 22:05:00,8605,"  You were about 41/2 days behind us Harry. Yeah we had super high water but by and large very nice weather. Only one day, Thursday the 29th it rained all day. We left nothing behind, so no I don't think the wood was from us.  Sorry to hear about your mishaps."
728650,HarryBB,2012-09-10 13:29:00,13,I wouldn't call them mishaps.  Just another set of challenges that we met.  I would love to do the river again at normal levels.  Even with the high water it was hard to keep the trout from jumping into my fly box after the mice I had stashed.  One Zoo Cougar probably went 20 casts before I was able to get it all the way back without a pesky fish on the darn thing.  I swear one cast produced a fish 6 inches in the air beofre the fly hit the water - aerial feeding behaviour.  There was a couple - Michelle and Monique - from Edmonton I think - on the river.  They were going to be there for three weeks but had a sat phone and called for a week early pick up because the island they were camped on was shrinking and water was running up against their tent.  They flew back to Hearst with us in a pretty crowded airplane.

728656,Paulus,2012-09-10 14:02:00,522,"Yes, that's the caveat of being the photographer. In general, to operate the apparatus, you have to be behind it - not in front.  No bear pics? That's a bummer  I would have given a considerable sum to see your face with the bear coming up behind!  p.-"
728661,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 14:17:00,2710,"Now Mike, I know YOU think you have a life outside of OFC BUT its been a week that you've been back and I and others here are jonesing hard for this report. Please turn your back on your wife,kids,job and any other TRIVIAL responsibilities society has led you to believe you have and let us, for a few minutes anyway, live our brook trout fantasies vicariously through you. I reiterate Priorities man, PRIORITIES!"
728670,solopaddler,2012-09-10 15:09:00,8605," I feel like I'm back in high school with a huge report overdue that I don't want to work on.  I'm headed back up north on Wed, so I'm going to try and whip it off either late tonight or tomorrow night."
728674,solopaddler,2012-09-10 15:13:00,8605,"  I have 600 odd photos to sift through now, it's a mind numbing task. Bill sent me a ton, plenty of shots of me now.  We actually do have a couple of bear pic's. Not  of the aggressive one though.  And it wasn't coming up behind me, it was a full frontal assault. I was pretty calm I thought. I had a much closer encounter with polar bears many years ago.  Billy was a bit excited though."
728675,mirogak,2012-09-10 15:20:00,387," Man! what a pic! beautiful fish too!  What camera did you use for this shot, Bill?  And yes, I hope you caught some takes on tape.  Can't wait."
728677,mirogak,2012-09-10 15:24:00,387, I am with Brad on this one ....
728831,SirCranksalot,2012-09-10 22:53:00,3291,Not me. I am so sick and tired of seeing  Mike hold up specks that I can't even dream of catching that I've been swallowing gravol like nobody's business! No more speck porn puhleeze!!   
728923,Paulus,2012-09-11 02:08:00,522,"Funny  But actually, I don't mind doing that work, myself. It's a neat way of re-living the experiences.  Also, I use Picasa, which makes it a lot easier to fly through your pics (once you get used to it) and half the time, when you hit ""I feel lucky,"" you actually get lucky...uh... I mean you get something decent. Also you can crop your pics and never touch the original, because Picasa basically remembers the changes as ""add ons"" to your pics, so that the changes you make in Picasa are only visible in Picasa. If you look at them in Windows picture viewer, for example, the changes are not there. That's really cool when you want to keep pristine originals. This is why you always see ""b"" and ""c"" at the end of so many of my pics, because I ""save as"" from Picasa as a new file, to avoid fouling up the original one.  Anyway, please work overtime on this one, Borg. Resistance is futile. Git 'er done!    p.-"
729025,Christopheraaron,2012-09-11 14:31:00,3525,"I'm tired of waiting, there had better be an epic, epic report at the end of this! No pressure Mike."
729268,Musky or Specks,2012-09-12 05:04:00,2710,"Just got home from work. Was all excited to come on OFC. SIGH Mike, just SIGH!"
727039,chris.brock,2012-09-04 00:14:00,4053,"I would guess you're working on a full report, can you give us a sneak preview of how the trip went?"
727046,solopaddler,2012-09-04 00:27:00,8605,"Nothing downloaded yet Chris, but hundreds upon hundreds of 3-4lb brookies mostly on topwater mouse patterns. Just mind blowing. We were also chased by a polar bear LOL!"
727051,woodenboater,2012-09-04 00:30:00,2277, :blink:  cannot wait to read this TR !!!!
727058,kickingfrog,2012-09-04 00:47:00,8333, So did you get caught?
727061,solopaddler,2012-09-04 00:50:00,8605," Nope, Billy fired 3 slugs at it. I did however have to run to the canoe and break off a 3lb brookie I was quite intently and obliviously fighting at the time on my fly rod.  Good times."
727062,GbayGiant,2012-09-04 00:50:00,1780,You ran from a Polar Bear?
727066,kickingfrog,2012-09-04 00:55:00,8333,Always good to have at least one slow runner in the groupâ€¦ and if you can't pick out the slow runner in your group it's because it's you.
727070,chris.brock,2012-09-04 00:59:00,4053,"sounds like it's going to be a great report, looking forward to it"
727071,solopaddler,2012-09-04 00:59:00,8605, Yes indeed. It was an occurence that now looking back only adds spice to the story. At the time though it was a bit unsettling.  Without playing the spoiler there's a truly great tale to be told.
727082,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 01:14:00,2710,You ran and left Billy to the bear? Being your friend isn't all sunshine and great fishing trips it appears
727094,solopaddler,2012-09-04 01:41:00,8605, We were fishing on shore. I was 30' upstream from Bill and he was maybe 20' upstream from the canoe where our gun was. The bear was maybe 20' upstream from me.  You do the math.
727097,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 01:46:00,2710,
727130,BillM,2012-09-04 03:20:00,17367," The only running was back to the canoe to grab the Remington 1187 Super Mag and fire 3 slugs over it's head to persuade it to go into the woods, instead of down the bank towards us.  In hind sight, I probably should have grabbed the camera instead of the gun after talking to the local natives about our encounter.  Lots of polar bear spottings at that specific spot, I'm sure we weren't the first humans it's seen.    As far as fish, here's a teaser.  "
727131,Musky or Specks,2012-09-04 03:35:00,2710,Thats some teaser. The fly in the corner of the mouth is awesome. I hope you were able to get some takes on video
727132,adolson,2012-09-04 03:38:00,783,WOW. What a gorgeous picture!
727135,solopaddler,2012-09-04 04:15:00,8605,"Nice pic dude! I need more pic's of me. 328 shots on my camera and 90% of them are of you.LOL!  And Brad, Bill did get at least one phenominal bit of mouse eating footage on film. I have a couple of clips on my point and shoot but they don't compare."
727137,Moosebunk,2012-09-04 05:10:00,3970,Git the lead out yer aznasses boyz.  I personally can't wait.  It's going to be amazing to see the Sutton through the eyes of two lads I know will do it supreme justice here online for all.  Great pic Bill.  More like that to come I'm hoping.  Good to hear ya survived getting your skin peeled off and inards digested by that big ole white fluff monster. lol.
727138,Kingsalmon,2012-09-04 05:15:00,107,"When I fished up there about fifteen years ago we did a day trip flight to Pine lake and we fished a 500m section of river between the lake and a large pond.  When I rounded the last bend before the pond, I had to stop and convince myself of what I was seeing.  Huge Brookies launching themselves out of the water eating flying bugs.  I didn't have my flyrod but I had my flybox and tied on the largest bug I had.  I cast it as far as I could and let it drift down the rapid into the pond.  Brookies were launching themselves stupid trying to grab the fly.  Eventually one would mouth it.  Caught over 20 fish and 2 x 6 pounders and you heard them splash like a concrete block would.  Awesome fun.  Maybe next year again.  Mike, did you not get any of the big sea-run fish?  They're usually bigger than the resident 3 pounders."
727235,I'mHooked,2012-09-04 14:40:00,525,"Wow, looking forward to this one guys! Can't wait! That sure is one pretty looking fish there Bill."
727237,4x4bassin,2012-09-04 14:47:00,1025,"That brookie picture is outstanding , one of the best I have ever seen   Can't wait for the report !"
727247,singingdog,2012-09-04 15:19:00,1047,"Stunning fish, and stunning pic. Those fish are obviously not leader shy!"
727249,BillM,2012-09-04 15:26:00,17367," They aren't shy about anything, lol.  I can't count the number of fish I caught at my feet with the mouse dangling in the water while I was doing something else and not paying attention..  I also caught at least a dozen fish on false casts..  The mouse would barely touch the water and they'd explode on it..  A fly fishermans dream for sure."
727266,kickingfrog,2012-09-04 16:42:00,8333," Always go up on shore to heed the ""call of nature"" in those spots."
727355,Jds63,2012-09-04 22:36:00,1365,"it's another Epic tale I am sure, I'm getting my beer and pretzels and pullin up a chair ..."
727363,GBW,2012-09-04 22:53:00,8460,"ok, I need to see this report!  any pic's of Bill shooting as you run Mike?  HAHA"
