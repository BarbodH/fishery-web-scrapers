727056,lookinforwalleye,2012-09-04 00:40:00,4399,"had the boat out today and my 2008 Optimax started stalling at idle and while in gear at low RPM`s It starts fine and runs perfect at speed. First thing I thought was plugs and they are the original plugs in it, any suggestions?  Thanks"
727158,hirk,2012-09-04 10:57:00,571,"Maybe not what you want too hear but I wouldnt run it again without taking it to a GOOD opti mechanic, whatever is causing could possibly result in a blown power head.Remember what you paid for it and it may make that pill easier to swlallow."
727164,waso,2012-09-04 11:48:00,44, Check fuel filters (should be a large and a small). Water fuel separator if u have one. Could also be something in fuel (bad fuel). Possibly Carbs could use a cleaning.
727191,G.mech,2012-09-04 12:50:00,830,"  Not likely a carb problem, Optimax engines are fuel injected.  If the fuel filter were plugged it would be losing power at high speed before low speed and would give you a low fuel pressure alarm.  If there is water in the separator (which is onboard the engine) it will give you a ""water in fuel"" alarm.   These problems are common with older outboards but these new things are far more complex and there aren't many simple solutions.  Spark plugs are rarely an issue on these engines and at $40 each it's an expensive experiment.   I know the Throttle Position Sensors can cause this if they fail but you have to go to the dealer to and the problem diagnosed.  The TPS and idle speed are not adjustable but are all controlled through the PCM and you need the high tech gear to figure it out.  Ignition coils have also been problematic on some engines but like hirk says, it's well worth the cost to pin the problem down and get it fixed properly before anything else gets messed up...these things are pretty high tech and the old band aid fixes we used to apply to outboards don't very often work anymore.  If you don't have the diagnostic equipment, you're pretty well forced to go to somebody who does unfortunately and given the cost of parts, it can be a costly adventure to just start guessing at things.   Good Luck and please post when you find the problem...."
727197,GbayGiant,2012-09-04 13:10:00,1780,Bad gas? Dirty injectors or just bad injectors? It is a poptamax after all.
727200,ecmilley,2012-09-04 13:14:00,2163,all makes of dfi engines are complicated and require diagnostic software to properly diagnose (just like most of todays cars) much better to pay a place an hours labor for a sound diagnosis then trying to throw parts at it that may require a new powerhead
727210,lookinforwalleye,2012-09-04 13:38:00,4399,"Well looks like a trip to a marine mechanic is in order!  Anybody know a good mechanic in the Orillia area, I know Leatherdale is just down the road from me but don`t know much about them!"
727215,ecmilley,2012-09-04 13:52:00,2163,my best recommendation would be top gun marine. #905-775-0862 there in innisfil

The mechanic asked me if I had the plugs out I said no, he told me all 3 plugs were loose one almost completely out. Some jerk must have tampered with the motor! Anyways all fixed and running like new again!"
729101,jedimaster,2012-09-11 18:56:00,3472,WOW that is weird.
729113,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-09-11 19:30:00,1107,have you had your coils changed they are in the recall all 2008-2011 mercs (not 2strokes or verado's) are on a special service bulletin and your dealer should replace them
729135,bigbuck,2012-09-11 20:52:00,2449,"SRT, he's got an Optimax which is a 2stroke. Not on the recall."
