723427,Luke V.,2012-08-18 12:09:00,286,Last night got out for a quick solo fish on the river. Launched at 445 off at 815. Managed to get into some good numbers. 16 smallies in total. All on tube jigs. 20-30 FOW. Most fish were between 12-15 inches. Which is good to see as they were all very healthy and fighting hard! Caught two fish around 17 and one at 19.5. The cooler weather dropped water temps by 5-6 deg. F. Seems to have made them alot more active.  Tight lines

723478,Luke V.,2012-08-18 18:38:00,286,Chris. Thanks. Fighting these in 30 feet of water is awesome. 2-3 minute fights with a couple jumps. Makes for a good time.

729613,Luke V.,2012-09-13 19:12:00,286,lol if the salmon are eating the bass they will be massive. There are some large kings that are dead on the shore. The birds have been getting good meals out of them the past week and a half.
