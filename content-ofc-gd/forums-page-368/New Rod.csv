729621,hoby5,2012-09-13 20:13:00,42,"Hey everyone,  Im just looking for some advice on getting a new rod. Im mostly a walleye fisherman and i usally Jig for them so id like a good jigging combo any advice?    thanks- shane"
729624,fishnsled,2012-09-13 20:24:00,3520,"Sky is the limit, do you have a budget you'd like to stick with? 1 piece or 2 piece rod?"
729627,hoby5,2012-09-13 20:30:00,42,Lol yea I guess I was a little too vague. Id like 2 piece and for full combo i have around 300-400$ to spend.
729628,davey buoy,2012-09-13 20:36:00,5505,You do not need any where near that price for walleye gear as you will find out soon.A lot of people prefer lighter set ups.Some a little heavier for trolling.
729630,ttahhan,2012-09-13 20:53:00,191,Hello There i personally enjoy using Team Diawa Reels and G.Loomis Rods...... Heres a great combo in your price range give it a look...   G. Loomis® GL2 Jig & Worm Series  Daiwa® Accudepth  Although almost any reel will work the rod has to have a backbone though....
729632,davey buoy,2012-09-13 20:59:00,5505,"Medium,fast tip,would be a lot of fun as i have seen and heard. IMO."
729633,fishnsled,2012-09-13 21:13:00,3520,"I'm assuming you want a jigging rod from your original post. Certainly agree with davey bouy and that you don't need to spend anywhere near that for a decent combo. You can get a really nice combo for $150 to $200 and still have money in the bank for more jigs.  However if you want to spend it all, I'd look at the Shimano Stradics and maybe a Spiel custom rod. Certainly worth a PM to Spiel and see what he can do for you on a rod. From there, see what is left over for the reel. You can still get a nice reel in the $50-$100 range."
729639,Stoty,2012-09-13 21:52:00,2910,"Check out Big Bear rods... I have a few and they are unreal. Their handles are amazing, and nothing else like it on the market.  PM me for more details...I can hook you up with a great price too.  Edit - added link....  Big Bear's Website"
729640,GBW,2012-09-13 21:59:00,8460,"for jigging, I say go find the rod and action you want before you decide on the reel.  here's a combo many on here will LOL @ me for but it's a great 'toss it in the boat and not worry about it' rod and reel that I tend to use WAY more than I ever thought I would.  A shimano voltaeus 7' Med with a shimano sienna 2500.  Light (well to me it is) and has landed more walleye then I have lost with it.  Just a thought because a good line and jig's are always needed, grub's too and I buy $100 or more in bulk at a time!"
729641,DaveMc,2012-09-13 22:10:00,89,"For a decent rod and reel ""combo"" you should be able to get something for less than $200. (Just basing on what i have in the store here you should be able to get something like a 6'6"" Okuma Dead Eye 2pc Med rod and an Okuma Epixor 25b for less than $200 out the door). Take a look around though, if you are looking to spend more then look at the NEW Shimano Clarus Walleye Rods that are coming out. There is a 6'8"" MH and 7' Med 2pc coming and should sell for around $125.00, I got to play with them last Sunday and they are a nice rod. Pair one up with a Sedona or Sahara and you will be golden."
729644,mercman,2012-09-13 22:36:00,7054,"Depending where you plan on fishing,and with that kinda budget, get 2 combos.1 for jigging lite jig heads and 1 for jigging heavy jig heads.I fish in some heavy current areas that require a 1.5-2 oz jig head to hit bottom.I use a 6.5' medium heavy baitcaster with an old Abu Ambassadeur5000 reel.Works like a charm. For lighter jigs, i switch up to a 7' medium Abu Verdict spinning rod with an Abu Orra S reel.I love the sensitivity of this last combo."
729652,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-13 23:15:00,2690,"Save yourself a TON of money, Pflueger President and a Shimano Clarus 6'6"" rod.  Jigging for walleye isn't rocket science and truly doesn't need crazy expensive equipment."
729655,adempsey,2012-09-13 23:28:00,1498,"You really should consider a one piece rod if you're going to drop that much money.  Otherwise, I am not sure if the advantages of the higher priced 2 piece rods outweigh the advantage of a one piece.  My personal preference for rods are St. Croix and G Loomis.  New models are coming out from St.Croix for 2013, so it might be possible to pick the older models up at a great price.  I'd shop around.   If I were shopping for a walleye jigging rod I would look at:  G Loomis Walleye WJR752S or WJR752S GLX 6' 3"" Fast Action Medium Power  I actually purchased a WJR752S in the summer for a great price.  Excellent rod.  St. Croix Legend Tournament Walleye LTWS63MXF 6'3"" X-Fast Action Medium Power  St. Croix Legend Elite LES63MXF 6'3""	M Power	X-Fast Action    For two piece rods, I'd probably consider:  St. Croix Legend Tournament Walleye LTWS66MLF2 6'6"" Fast Action Medium-Light Power  St. Croix Avid AVS66MLF2 6'6""	ML Power Fast Action AVS66MF2 6'6""	M Power Fast Action  St. Croix Legend Elite LES66MLF2 6'6""	ML Power Fast Action LES66MF2 6'6""	M Power Fast Action  However, I don't know if I would spend more than $100-130 on a two piece rod.  If you end up lowering your budget, I think the St. Croix Eyecon series is really nice.  St. Croix Eyecon  ECS63MXF 6'3""	M Power	X-Fast Action One Piece ECS66MLF2 6'6""	ML Power Fast Action Two Piece  Most of my rods are St. Croix Premiers though.  St. Croix Premier  PS66MF2	6'6"" M Power Fast Action Two Piece is a good all around rod."
729659,bare foot wader,2012-09-13 23:36:00,1354,"if you're looking to burn cash on a high end combo, treat yourself to a cumulus or custom wrapped glx with tysg's...new xship stradic or sustain...8 lb braid....if a walleye so much as farts down there you'll feel it"
729660,kuhaman,2012-09-13 23:37:00,503,St.Croix legend and a shimano stradic is what I mainly use but shimano makes some great rods and reels at a very reasonable price.
729665,GBW,2012-09-13 23:52:00,8460,"So what kid of walleye was that I got with you last time when you tossed your big bass back like it was a baby rocky? and if I recall, it was on the combo I mentioned a few post's up..."
729668,backbay,2012-09-14 00:12:00,773,"Given recent results and consensus, pm Spiel."
729672,bigbuck,2012-09-14 00:27:00,2449,"St Croix Avid in m or ml action depending on your personal preference and for a reel, you can't go wrong with a stradic. I'm a fan of the highend Quantum reels as well."
729673,fish_fishburn,2012-09-14 00:35:00,1311,"Anything with extra fast tip, 6.6 to 7 ft long. Really dont need anything more than IM6. There durable and very sensative Medium lite to medium."
729682,GBW,2012-09-14 01:03:00,8460,"Shh and I know, hence my offer for the 'combo' I happened to be using. the second you had seen my fish you went all giddy like a school girl..."
729721,hoby5,2012-09-14 03:25:00,42,well by the sounds of it i have alot of options might go with 2 diff setups at around 200 each . Thanks for all thegreat advice guys much appreciated
729722,Joeytier,2012-09-14 03:33:00,3990,"Rod manufacturers are slowly drifting farther away from what most northern walleye anglers are looking for, and are catering more to bass anglers (understandably) with heavier rods with faster tips.  I use mostly 10+ year old medium power, medium action rods in the 6'6"" to 7'6"" range for walleye jigging.  Have a look at St. Croix Wild River and Fenwick Elitetech Blanks.  They'll fit what you want to do."

729744,lew,2012-09-14 11:37:00,12766,"I've always thought that if you need to buy a sensitive rod just to feel the fish biting, your after the wrong kind of fish"
