728966,Sinker,2012-09-11 04:10:00,8692," How big is the deck? I know people locally who may be able to get it done for you. I'd do it myself, but Its hunting season, and I have no time left!!  S."

729138,Billy Bob,2012-09-11 20:55:00,5865,"Skipper ""D"" on this board does all kinds of that work and has all the heavy equipment to do it, not to mention the experience....  It's nice to get offers from folks here to help out but most times when push comes to shove, their busy for one reason or another when you need them the most...  Give Skipper a PM.....he's in your area also, I believe.   Bob"
