727899,Toad Hunter,2012-09-06 21:13:00,261,I wish I had one to post but haven't been out more than a handful of times this year. But def. Look forward to hearing more reports from the french. I used to fish the upper near the old Keystone lodge area a few times a year but haven't been up in almost 3 yrs now
727904,Rich Clemens,2012-09-06 21:21:00,3131, There is a cure for that ya know.  Three years is just waaaaaaaaay too long  :-)
728094,John,2012-09-07 11:52:00,2956, Used to stay at Keystone back prolly before you were born. Great times....
728158,Toad Hunter,2012-09-07 15:57:00,261,"ya ya, well when i used to go , it was to a friends cottage who I no longer talk to (over a fight related to said destination) as for the ol Keystone, ya his cottage is on the island right across from Harris' bay (up river from Hunters) . the land was up for sale last time i was up there, anyone know what happened to the property ?"
728160,Jigs,2012-09-07 16:07:00,136,I got this girl up there a few weeks ago. We hammered little walleyes there and got 4-5 big ones. I absolutely love that area. Wish I could go back again this summer.. Have fun!  
728164,Luke V.,2012-09-07 16:23:00,286,I'll be there one week today for three days! I look forward to your report. I hope I can gather enough pic to get a good report of my own  Tight lines
729333,hoops12,2012-09-12 15:17:00,127,"Well it was a tough outing at the French.  No eyes were caught, but i did manage to catch a ton of bass.  Spent most of the time at the flat rapids along with 6 other boats and only 1 walter caught all weekend so i don't feel bad!"
