728848,siwash,2012-09-10 23:46:00,683,"Hey folks,  I am heading up to Lost Lake Lodge in about a week with a few friends and family.. We are Staying only 3 nights b/c of time constraints/work.. Anyhow, we hope to get in some grouse and bunny hunting, too, while there (logging roads should be good..)  Has anyone fished this lodge before? If anyone knows the area, what should we expect? I hear the SM bass is good but we hope to get into walleye and pike too.. Apparently there are even some trout lakes in this chain (we have access to 7 or 8 lakes I believe) I'm assuming the usual tactics of jigging and live bait will work? Any other tips would be most appreciated!  I hope to post a quality report upon our return...  Cheers!"
728850,ttahhan,2012-09-10 23:51:00,191,"Lost Lake  All the cottages and the main lodge are located along almost 1200 feet of shoreline on beautiful Lost Lake. This main lake is the first place to start fishing while honing your skills for the many other lakes yet to be explored. Most folks will fish for pike and small mouth bass during the day time and save the walleye fishing experience until after supper. Bass are easily caught in late day too using surface tackle rather than spoons or spinners preferred during the day time.  The range in depth is from 12 feet to 40 feet on average. There are spots where the bottom comes within five feet of the surface and are excellent places for walleye fishing late day.  Lost Lake itself is the staging point to access many more lakes and is considered the most important lake to learn. From Lost Lake, people gain access to Wigwam and Bloom lakes as well as two ""walk to"" trout lakes and another walleye and pike lake to the south.    Wigwam Lake  Wigwam Lake is the middle lake on your way north to Hodge lake. It's average depth is 40 feet with some places much shallower, good for jigging for walleye on an overcast day or especially after supper fishing. Wigwam is about two and a half miles long and nearly three quarters of a mile wide at it's widest. Lost Lake flows into the south end of Wigwam. This is probably the best walleye and bass fishing spot for after supper fishing. Three species are available in Wigwam with Walleye and bass being the main ones. Pike are here too but not in the numbers or size of some of the other lakes.  The creek flows to Bloom Lake at the north end of Wigwam and this is the access waterway to Bloom. While boating north from Wigwam, there is a marked landing where you park then walk around a beaver dam and rapids to more boats and motors. Gas is brought with you in a small wheel barrow or wagon to make the five minute walk even easier.    Bloom Lake  This six plus mile long lake is surely one of the best northern pike lakes in the north. For over two decades our guests have fished using ""Catch and Release"" technics only. Virtually every fish taken has been put back into the lake, after the much revered ""Smiley face"" photograph to prove that such monsters still do exist.    Calcite Lake  This lake is about a mile and a half long and quite narrow in some spots. It has proven to be a very good lake for both walleye and pike. It's an easy walk to lake at the end of a short trail. In wet weather you'll need weatherproof footwear because there are some soggy spots en route. Gas must be hand carried but a part tank will keep you fishing all day.    Leta Lake  Speckled trout are in good supply in this very clear lake. Specs are also called Brook Trout by our southern United States neighbors. The walk in is about half an hour. The trail is well signed with teaching plaques all along the way. Learn about everything from moose, wolves and black bear to flora indiginous to the region.  Sigs Lake  This speckled (brook) trout lake is about a half hour walk from the landing in Lost Lake with a well marked trail all the way. The best fishing is from shore in several distinct spots.    Flatstone Lake  This Rainbow trout lake is just beautiful with maybe the most difficult to catch strain of trout around. A really good day is possibly three trout per person but the experience will never be forgotten.    Leroy Lake  Small mouth bass are in great supply in this lake. It can be reached easily by car or if you'd like, we will drive you there and pick you up again.    Everett Lake  Both pike and bass abound in this long thin lake. Again, it is easily reached by car or we will take you there and pick you up.    Miller Lake  Miller is all about lake trout. A difficult lake to fish unless you know the secrets. We will take you there and pick you up or you can come and go using your own vehicle.  "
728855,siwash,2012-09-11 00:05:00,683,"Great post.. thanks.. I saw some of that info on each lake on their site. I am assuming you've fished this lodge? Given that we only have a few days, which of the other lakes (other than Lost) would you target  for quality? We rather getting into fish rather than search for lunkers.. Walleye would be good, but not necessarily the only species we'd target..  I am assuming that the smaller lakes would be accessed day time only and save the eve. walleye fishing to main lake  Thanks again.. "
729000,lew,2012-09-11 12:16:00,12766," My brother and I were up there for a week back in June of '96 and without a doubt, it was the best smally fishing I've ever seen, infact it was incredible. There was a heavy Mayfly hatch that year and the bass were gorging on them and we'd just toss Skitterpops into the Mayflies near shore and would get bass on nearly every cast.  Course that was June so it won't apply to September but it may boost your confidence nonetheless.  There were steel boats cached on several different lakes and you carry a gas can and small outboard with you and just basically hop from one boat to another as you changed lakes but none of the portages were very far.  Best part was there was no road access to any of the other lakes and the only boat ramp was Lost Lake so we basically had the entire lake system to ourselves and we never saw another boat  for the entire 7 days, although that may no longer be like that now.  Can't offer anything for this time of year other than to say it's a great lodge and if it's still owned by the same family your gonna be treated very well and will definetely enjoy your stay."
729243,siwash,2012-09-12 01:53:00,683,  Apparently new ownership since 2011.. hope its still good..  The boats supposdly have motors and gas awaiting you...  Looking forward to pass on a report  thanks lew
