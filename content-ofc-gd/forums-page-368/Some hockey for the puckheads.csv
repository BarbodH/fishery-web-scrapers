729199,kickingfrog,2012-09-11 23:50:00,8333,TSN is showing the finals of the 1987 Canada Cup the next couple of nights.  Game #1 tonight Game #2 Wednesday Game #3 Thursday  That should get me through until the OHL regular season starts.
729216,Rod Caster,2012-09-12 00:49:00,5784,right on. Go Gretzky!
729231,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 01:25:00,8333,Weird fact that I thought of while watching the game:  Which player in the series was the last to still be playing in the NHL?
729232,Rod Caster,2012-09-12 01:27:00,5784,its gotta be claude lemieux...didn't he play just a couple years ago for the Sharks?
729249,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 02:21:00,8333,"He was the last player from that team to play a game in the NHL, but I don't think he played in the final series. If he did, then you are right."
729262,otter649,2012-09-12 03:32:00,118,Mario Lemieux was only 21 when playing in this series so he may have been the last active player from this series.  Watched the game tonight Team Canada did alot of dump & chase hockey whereas The Russians skated the puck over the blue line in order to keep puck possesion for the most part.
729280,Harrison,2012-09-12 10:46:00,2202,"Highest all time scoring brothers to wear an NHL jersey?  If you google and respond, you cheat and should feel shame."
729304,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 13:16:00,8333,"I figured it was Mario, considering he had cancer and had retired for the first time in the 90's it's not who I first thought it was. Messier."
729316,Peps,2012-09-12 14:16:00,191,"Watching that game last night, I couldn't help but think of the damage Mario and Wayne would do in today's game!!  A whole lot of clutching and grabbing going on there"
729356,Mike Pike,2012-09-12 16:47:00,1332,Spoiler alert... We win.
729362,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 16:55:00,8333, Funny I was thinking about today's stars shooting on those goalies and the total lack of tight checking.
729397,davey buoy,2012-09-12 19:58:00,5505,"I watched a short bit ,didn't see Wayner. What time tonight does it start,and was it TSN?."
729424,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 22:31:00,8333,"Keenan was on the radio this morning talking about coaching that '87 team. I only caught a little bit of the interview, but in talking about the depth and talent on the team he cut 5 hall of fame players. One of which was Stevie Y."
729452,SirCranksalot,2012-09-13 00:16:00,3291,  Sort of like watching the Leafs play after Jan----you already know the outcome. ('cept here you at least see some real hockey)
729467,kickingfrog,2012-09-13 00:57:00,8333,"On tonights broadcast Keenan mentioned the HoFers cut from the team:  Al MacInnis Scott Stevens Cam Neely Dino Ciccarelli Yezermen  For me the defencemen were the interesting picks. Considering Normand Rochefort, Craig Hartsburg, Doug Crossman and James Patrick made the team but MacInnis and Stevens didn't. I get players filling roles and defensive defencemen and since they won it's hard to say they were wrong but I'm sure the decisions on who got cut were heated discussions."
