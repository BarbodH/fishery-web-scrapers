If you could fish any body of water within 3hrs of Toronto for pike, where would it be? We do not want to fish anywhere in Lake Ontario and have had our fill of Dalrymple this season..so they are off the list. Thanks all!    HFP"

728968,Musky or Specks,2012-09-11 04:19:00,2710,I'm sorry but you won't find more big pike closer than the far north than right in Lake Simcoe. Now catching them on the other hand.
728970,Wendel,2012-09-11 04:38:00,213,I've done all right for pike in long point inner bay. It's probably pretty tough to find them this time of year though as they head deeper.  I would also recommend Mitchell's Bay in Lake St. Clair.   You may end up with some Musky though.  I also second the Moon River....
728984,siwash,2012-09-11 10:47:00,683,For an overnight close to T.O. I'd say Honey Harbour/Port Severn Region  For the best pike fishing  (PERIOD) Toronto Islands!! I've seen more trophy pike there than anywhere else in Ontario! Rent a room downtown!
729002,backbay,2012-09-11 12:20:00,773,"The pike in the Moon have been in deep water, and are just now starting to come out to play, and as the water cools, they'll get busier. The bass fishing has been good! If you decide on that area, for lodging, you can call call George Grisdale at 705-375-2495, or Woods Bay Lodge at 705-375-5395."
729263,hungryforpike,2012-09-12 03:45:00,46,"Well that is a few votes for Moon..i think that may be the ticket. Any details on the body of water, big open rough water or small and calm? This cooler weather isn't great for day to day, but if it is waking the pike up..that is great news.    HFP   "
729281,backbay,2012-09-12 10:55:00,773,"Woods Bay can kick up in really bad weather, but will probably be the largest body of water you fish. The area is a largely sheltered: you don't need to fish the open."
729294,NAW,2012-09-12 12:25:00,4022, X2.  Lots of water to cover.  Lots of places to stay.  Lots of BIG pike!
729312,whiskywizard,2012-09-12 14:09:00,305,"The Key River, north of Parry Sound, produces lots of Pike, some monsters. It's on the outside edge of your 3h limit from TO but well worth it. The river has miles of sheltered waters for the rough days, and the archipelago at the mouth opens up into Georgian Bay if you feel like some open water time."
