729364,fishnsled,2012-09-12 17:02:00,3520," They are all good G.  As for your chair Gerritt - do you mean the outhouse?? If so - it was honoured.....    The ""band"" is playing pretty well, might have finished 2 songs this time.  Now if Cliff would pick up the guitar and practice between trips......      So looking forward to the next trip Bernie."
729441,Fish Farmer,2012-09-12 23:31:00,2234,"Looks like you guys had a good weekend, some good friends and a few fish to boot."
729450,MJL,2012-09-13 00:09:00,2427,"Looks like a great weekend  On that note, when I think of weekend fishing trips with Cliff, I now can't help but worry about sleep deprivation"
729454,Daplumma,2012-09-13 00:19:00,1961,"Every year when we head up that way I tell myself we are gonna stop by and see Bernies shop.Now I wanna see the island ,too.Looks like a great time,maybe next time! Joe"
729459,Bernie,2012-09-13 00:25:00,3190,You would be welcome anytime Joe!
729507,Mike the Pike,2012-09-13 03:15:00,3421, Beauty sunset pics WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
729523,Bernie,2012-09-13 10:45:00,3190,Will didn't drink enough. That's actually a sunrise. Something many of us don't see on these weekends.
729570,fishnsled,2012-09-13 15:36:00,3520," Sorry Bernie, I'll try to make up for my lack of drinking the next trip.  I was a beautiful sunrise though.  Can't believe I was the first guy up both days!"
728716,Headhunter,2012-09-10 18:02:00,5703,"Well another weekend at Bernie's has come and gone... man, the three fastest days of the year! FishnSled, CCMT and I left Whitby at 9:30 Friday morning, knowing full well that the weather predictions for the weekend were grim at best... Spiel left from the Hammer around the same time. We met up with Bernie at his shop in Powasson and then off to the island for some fish'n and some R and R. Knowing that the weather was going to change for the bad, we got out early Friday evening before the front came in. Spiel, Bernie and myself in Bernie's boat and CCMT in FnS's boat. Our boat had the hot bite with us boating 13 Pickereyes in about three hours. We ended up with four keepers, the rest returned to grow a little, but instructed to watch out for nets! LOL! Cliff was up for taking care of one meal and he picked up some exquisite Strip loins, home made french fries (picked out of Bernie's garden that day) and of course, corn on the cob. We have as a group decided that CLiff will be buyng the steaks from now on! Saturday was a wash out... winds at 40k gusting well above that, rain all day, mostly going sideways! Good day for; -a nap! -painting ups some jigs Bernie had some friends arrive on Saturday afternoon, one of them from Bristol England. Good to meet both Ricnick and Bob! Dinner Saturday night was extra thick pork chops, garlic mashed taters and of course, corn on the cob. Thanks FnS! Sunday was clear, cold and windy... Fns and CCMt went out got some small ones, all returned. The drive was quick and uneventful, just the way we like it! I know some of the guys took some pics (WILL, CCMT and I think Bernie as well.) Hopefully they will drop in and add to the report. Thanks again Bernie and to the other guys as well, it was a fun game as everyone played it quickly!LOL HH  PS... what key were we playing Sultans of Swing in Cliff! LMAO"
728736,ccmtcanada,2012-09-10 18:31:00,7971,"Yep!  Was a great weekend as always...my gut still hurts from all the laughing!  You had the hot boat?  Where are your fish pics?  Here's ours LOL      Seems this perch was almost a toothy critter's lunch!!   On the Friday evening, I caught a real nice keeper sized fish and put it in the livewell.  I wanted a picture for the report so near the end of the evening, I took it out of the livewell....held it out to take a picture and Will says ""I'll laugh so hard if the thing flips into the water"".  I said ""Oh come on...""  Two seconds later...with the fish held an arm's length out, it starts flipping out...Will turns to look just as the fish hits the water and swims away!  Was great painting those jigs...went out and caught a walleye on it on the Sunday!  The steaks...all I said to the butcher was ""I want really really good grilling steaks"" and he handed me the package!  We are always fed extremely well there...one of the highlights of the trip for sure!  Key?  Hmmmm...I dunno...D minor I think!  I was more impressed that we sorta got through Spirit of Radio!   Some other assorted pics....   Will and I managed to get out on Saturday night after the rain.  The protected areas were ""ok"", but the main lake still had 5 footers on it.  We didn't stay out long but managed to take a pic of the sunset.   I think Spiel was there too....can't remember for sure as I don't have any pictures of him...."
728739,Roy,2012-09-10 18:36:00,13728,No pink gloves this time?  Josephine's not doing the dishes?
728742,Spiel,2012-09-10 18:43:00,9065,"I did my share of dishes Roy, bare handed.  Thanks to Bernie and company for a great weekend!"
728745,lew,2012-09-10 18:49:00,12766," Bernie grows French Fries in his garden ??  WOW, talk about a green thumb"
728748,ccmtcanada,2012-09-10 18:56:00,7971," We said ""where are the potatoes Bernie?""  He said ""I have to go and dig them up"".  Talk about fresh! LOL"
728750,Joey,2012-09-10 19:07:00,9122,"Wow, great report and pics so far, hope there are more pics to come.  I'd like to see these garden french fries too"
728756,fishnsled,2012-09-10 19:23:00,3520," I hope they listen to you Joe!    Giesler Island potatoes kick P.E.I. potatoes in the  Lew.   Awesome time as always gentlemen. Great seeing you all again, good times had by all. Nice to have your buds join us Bernie. Hope Bob got away OK and that Nick enjoys the rest of his stay.	Thanks for posting some pics Cliff and doing up the report Joe. Till the next time!!"
728758,Spiel,2012-09-10 19:26:00,9065,Weekends need to be mandatorily longer!
728780,Headhunter,2012-09-10 20:27:00,5703,"Saves a lot of chopping Lew! LOL I think Bernie took a pic of Spiel and I by the BBQ with our bounty... I forgot the gloves again Roy! Funny we took a close to ten mile run out onto the lake and at about the half way point I asked Bernie and Spiel who had a camera... we all did, back at the cottage! HH"
728800,GBW,2012-09-10 21:41:00,8460,nice report guys

728879,Bernie,2012-09-11 00:57:00,3190,"Yes, I'm all for 3 day weekends every weekend. Had a blast as we always seem to do regardless of weather.  Yes, we have proof! I count 6 pickereyes plus a perch Joe.     Once the water that accumulated in my fryer was boiled out the fries turned out really good. Not sure that they will ever be duplicated.  Once again, we had the Sunday afternoon    session before the trip home.     Great weekend guys, looking forward to February!  Thanks for posting the thread Joe"
728932,fishnsled,2012-09-11 02:38:00,3520,"Great shots Bernie, always nice to spend a bit of time lounging outside before the trip home. I didn't take many pics at all, had Cliff with me so why would I?  Here are a couple of the sunrise you all missed on Sunday.          Thanks again for a great weekend gents! How many days till the next one??"
728934,Moosebunk,2012-09-11 02:45:00,3970,Holy some wicked pics there FNS!  Looks like a great time for all involved.  Friends just chillin' and fishin'.  Can't beat a weekend of that.

729355,Bernie,2012-09-12 16:41:00,3190,"Hi Gerritt. Sorry you did not make it up. February will be here soon enough. Can't say I am looking forward to the long winter, but the weekends you fellows come up do make them seem a little shorter."
