728873,Rich Nelson,2012-09-11 00:43:00,332,"What about that is a joke? Do I know Dale? No, but Ive met him, and he is a joke. Am I jealous of the big fish he caught? Sure I am. We would all love to catch a giant like that. And I never said that they dont get as big as Gbay... open your eyes. I said the Larry fish arent as heavy for their size.   Are you jealous because another waterbody has heavier fish than the Ottawa or Larry? gimme a break. They are all World class fisheries. I had nothin bad to say about Rich Clarkes monster last year, and I beilieve its size. Dales, I dont. Especially when hes askin if I want his autograph... ha ha"
728882,esoxansteel,2012-09-11 01:03:00,1307,"  I hope Dale does catch another big musky, and keeps it cause you would look good with 60 inches of esox hanging out your"
728891,Pigeontroller,2012-09-11 01:15:00,2793,  I love it when you show your sensitive side!
728895,Gregoire,2012-09-11 01:22:00,1397,"I can't believe that some people are holding a guy responsible for a phrase that he uttered while catching a giant fish. It's not like he is going around claiming to everyone that he caught a record fish. He was excited at catching a monster and made a comment while I'm sure he was pumped up with adrenaline. For those who fish musky catching a monster can be overwhelming. I could understand in the heat of the moment making a ridiculous comment. My buddy caught a big fish this summer and after he caught it I had to send him to the back of the boat while I unhooked it, he was that excited. At the time we though it was pushing 40 pounds, but later learned it was more like 30. If we were on video I might have claimed it was a 40.  This thread is getting stupid."
728897,bucktail,2012-09-11 01:28:00,1857,"Everything about that story is good, good for the sport. He caught a freakish big muskie and released it to swim again...how can anyone whine about that."
728900,Whitespinnerbait,2012-09-11 01:33:00,2038,  Dude....your making that up !!  :blink:
728909,danbouck,2012-09-11 01:51:00,4380,Nice Fish
728915,mercman,2012-09-11 01:59:00,7054,"After reading this thread, i may never share another Musky pic on the open forum again,no matter what size it is. Bloody shameful."
728931,Pigeontroller,2012-09-11 02:36:00,2793,"  Actually its true...  This is an old story and needs to go nighty,night."
728977,Whitespinnerbait,2012-09-11 09:29:00,2038, Does someone have it on tape??  Video ??  Witnesses ??  Photo's ??  I'll bet the farm it was taking out of '' context ''
728989,Handlebarz,2012-09-11 11:24:00,3790,Pretty sad with allthe new fishing threads and many musky ones with big fish not many post but a old fish gets posted and the bashing replies fly. It was a awesome fish and a great story how many we're or have been out night fishing late fall is the blowing wind and freezing cold?  Kudos go out to dale sal and juli for letting it go
728991,Roy,2012-09-11 11:29:00,13728,"Yes Mike and on your positive note, let's let this one rest. There will always be malcontents and the ones who urge them on."
728678,lew,2012-09-10 15:24:00,12766,"Dale never claimed this to be a record fish, everybody else did.  The man just caught a big fish, took a couple pics of it, along with some measurements, and put the big girl back in the water to swim another day.  Seems everytime somebody catches a huge musky the same tired old arguments start all over again.  When that fish was 1st caught the story and pictures were on every musky website. Some just congratulated the angler on a nice fish while others, including a few members from this site  tore the guy  apart. One of our members in particular basically called the man a liar because he didn't take pictures of the tape measure beside the fish as proof, even though the guy said he wasn't looking for a record.  Some guys are pretty pathetic actually."
728680,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 15:29:00,2710,Starting with the president of the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame.
728681,jedimaster,2012-09-10 15:34:00,3472,"He does refer to it as being a record musky in the video himself. With musky you gotta be real careful when you say thee words. at 46 seconds in the video... ""Thats when we knew we had a record muskie on""  Later the guys asks if its a record and he said ""It depends on who you ask.."" Impliying he believes its a record.  I don't feel bad for any flaq he takes, I mean if he is a Musky angler he knows what Record means. I mean seriously congrats and good for him, but he knows what the term ""Record Musky"" entails, just as every musky angler out there."
728689,jedimaster,2012-09-10 16:14:00,3472,"IGFA also has a catch and release record but you need to use one of there approved scales. To be honest its a good idea, its pretty easy to fake a measurement if need be.... eg folding the girth measurement tape behind the fish, using a modified ruler or whatever. Record means you need to follow the rules of that record keeper. Its just how it is."
728719,jimmer,2012-09-10 18:06:00,2730,"Great fish. Who cares if it was a record or not. Nice that he released it, now one of us might catch her."
728725,Rich Nelson,2012-09-10 18:13:00,332,"You have a scale in your boat that goes to 70 lbs? Most guys dont.... Many large fish are killed each year because the angler thinks they have a record, only to realize that their 57 incher only weighs 50 lbs. Length and girth formulas dont mean a thing on those giants. If it was as Big as Dale claimed, it would be dead.... End of story. For the record, the St Lawrence fish Dont get as heavy as Musky from the Bay for their size...."
728727,mistyriver1,2012-09-10 18:14:00,600,"  Amen Lew.  It's a nice fish, let's leave it at that."
728728,Rich Nelson,2012-09-10 18:16:00,332,And the record Musky will not make anybody rich... Ha ha.
728737,glen,2012-09-10 18:31:00,2641,No but it will cause a hell of a fight.
728738,glen,2012-09-10 18:33:00,2641,Funny thing is most people dont know what the world record is anyway.

728743,jedimaster,2012-09-10 18:44:00,3472,Depends on who's books you look in. Some have disallowed the 69 and some have not.
728753,muskymatt,2012-09-10 19:20:00,2608," What a ridiculous statement! So how the hell would you know? Seriously, do you know Dale? Were you there? Did you measure the fish? Sound like a clear cut case of envy to me!  I have a question for you. Have many 60""+ fish do you know of that have come from the Larry????????????  They don't get as big as Gbay, lol please!  What a joke"
728789,BillM,2012-09-10 20:56:00,17367," Actually I do, lol (Still waiting for that monster lake trout!)"
728794,jedimaster,2012-09-10 21:19:00,3472,"How is it possible to weigh a LIVE musky accurately enough to determin ounces, while in a boat, in the water, with the thing ALIVE and all the while being able to release it without it dieing from the stress. I doubt it was actually weighed, no biggie in my eyes though, he didn't want to shoot for a record, so leave it at that. Be happy, its an awesome fish and a great looking replica mount. It swims for another day, I don't think those big 12+year old musies even spawn anymore do they? Aren't they just eating machines at that point? Good on him for sticking to his guns and letting it go. I honestly can say that if I thought it was close to a record, I would have a real hard time letting her swim away. He did call it a record himself in the video though. So the flaq he is getting/got/will get is all on him. A photo of the measure goes a long way."
728795,BillM,2012-09-10 21:23:00,17367,"If I caught anything that was extremely close to 60inches and 30inches of girth, it would be coming home with me.. World record or one for the wall."
728799,Billy Bob,2012-09-10 21:39:00,5865,World record musky or not...........either way it still taste like   .....LOL...I would rather eat perch...  But a VERY Nice fish...

728812,BucktownAngler,2012-09-10 22:06:00,582, haters gonna hate
728819,Pigeontroller,2012-09-10 22:22:00,2793,"  touchy subjects for Matt, Leafs vs. Sens and Dale's Fish!"
728825,muskymatt,2012-09-10 22:46:00,2608," Actually Dax, I just hate seeing a guy (no matter who it is) ripped for doing the right thing. A guy catches a really smokin fish, lets it go and then gets dragged over the coals by a bunch of jealous key board kings.  The only side I'm on is the side of fairness.  I'd even stick up for you Dax, if you were ever to catch a big Muskie"
728829,F7Firecat,2012-09-10 22:52:00,347,"McNair lost me when he went about asking people at the Odessey and I quote ""Do you want my autograph?"" and asking ""Do you know who I am?  Nice fish no doubt.....the rest of it no thanks."
728861,speedtroll,2012-09-11 00:25:00,52,"Awesome fish. absolutely incredible catch. that was caught in 2008 I might add.  This guy does the unselfish thing and let it go. Spawner or not it is there for someone else to catch. The replica that he had made looks 100 times better and will last far longer than that fish ever would mounted.  Whether it was 60 inches or 59.5 inches, or whether it had a girth of 33 or 32.5 inches. Who the hell cares. Anyone who has actually caught a large fish like that (which 99% of the people posting here HAVE NOT) knows that when you catch a hog like that, you are more concerned about getting the big girl back in the water quickly and healthy. You are also so PUMPED and the fish is usually struggling, it is VERY hard to get measurements at all.  Yet some people on this board can not just congratulate the guy for catching an amazing fish. They are not happy unless they rip the guy for not taking 20 different pics and getting 10 different measurements (to satisfy everyone else's curiosity), and end up killing this beast. UNBELIEVABLE!  It is absolutely no wonder why many people don't post their catches here anymore. It's just not worth the aggravation. Very sad."
728866,jedimaster,2012-09-11 00:34:00,3472,"I would agree but, imagine a guy that posts a picture of a fish he released of a Bass, and said on camera it was a record, then gets all miffed when he doesn't show it on a scale or with a tape measure. If he caught it, took a pic and said ""wow check this pig I caught and released"" People wouldn't have said anything bad. As soon as you utter record, you better have you ducks in a row."
728867,Rich Nelson,2012-09-11 00:34:00,332," Thats exactly it... He lucked into a big fish, and now he thinks hes king."

Watch the video you will understand what i mean.....decided to release and NOT Kill the fish for the sense of glory and fame ! How Big was Perry's Fish ??  Cheers!  "
728580,Terry,2012-09-09 23:56:00,14456,yeah he's a member here  great fish
728581,glen,2012-09-10 00:06:00,2641,Is a released fish bigger then a fish that is kept?

728584,Rich Nelson,2012-09-10 00:12:00,332, Absolutely! ha ha. He can claim whatever he wants... Big Fish? Yep. World record? Nope.  Only a dead Musky can hold a record.

As for the World record, I honestly hope someday folks will actually go fishing for the fun of the sport and forget all about who caught the biggest fish.....who really cares ??  It's an argument that's been going on for decades and some guys actually seem obsessed with it.  Musky fishing is fun and it's too bad so many can't realise that."

728633,DaveMc,2012-09-10 11:58:00,89,"IIRC that fish was 57"" x 33"", which if you calculate the weight, the formula puts that fish at 77.59 pounds (one of the more conservative formulas i have seen). I really would have liked to see an actual weight to see how close it is to the estimated weight. Beautiful fish either way."
728644,Jigger,2012-09-10 13:11:00,1237,I still cant get over how small the head is compared to the body. Lots of room to grow!
728655,GbayGiant,2012-09-10 13:47:00,1780,I wonder why no one ever takes pictures of them measuring the fish ? I mean they did measure it no?
728659,Loadman,2012-09-10 14:14:00,63,"LOL Gbay my thoughts exactly.... Dont get me wrong it IS a giant fish.... is it a WR well if we had pics of them measuring both length and girth you could have a better idea. Lets look back at another giant caught there the got stretched to 60"" a few years back when I think the lentgh was like 56.5"" and I also held that fish (frozen)... guess what 53lbs is what she was.... a great fish none the less.... and the guy who did the mount even added a cpl inches to it like you can so its even bigger. Sad part is the WR fish is worth alot of $$ to who gets it... alot like the WR bass...or walleye....So if you want the WR your gonna have to keep a fish and better make sure it has great proportions. I just wish a true monster in the 75lbs range came in and put all the who holds the WR issue to bed. Tired of this guy,.... no this guy...."
728660,BillM,2012-09-10 14:17:00,17367,I'd kill a WR muskie in a second and not feel bad about it..
728664,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 14:26:00,2710,"Bill, same here. But I'd have to be pretty sure about it being the WR. If Crossman were alive he'd love to study a WR specimen and I'm sure a lot could be gleaned from such a fish. Killed my first 20"" brook trout in a heartbeat I have got larger since and released them with no qualms. One for the wall is enough."
728671,jedimaster,2012-09-10 15:09:00,3472,"Tough to claim anything a world record unless its been verified. ESPECIALLY a muskie. I mean heck even a record perch is hotly debate. Giant? Huge? Awesome? yup all are true here... but World Record? O'briens fish was also 65 pounds. So for this to be a claimed 65 pound fish it would obvioulsy need to be weighed and measured properly. There is NO way you could call one fish a world record when a completly unofficial measurement weighs it the exact same as the current record.  JMHO but seriously a Huge , Giant and Awesome fish."
728673,BillM,2012-09-10 15:11:00,17367," Absolutely, if there were any doubts, she'd be going back."
