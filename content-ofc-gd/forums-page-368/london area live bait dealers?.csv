729311,SlowPoke,2012-09-12 14:08:00,2984,"Angling Sport on Adelaide, just north of Commissioners"
729323,bow slayer,2012-09-12 14:39:00,1074,  he has minnows?  thanks for the reply.
729325,SlowPoke,2012-09-12 14:47:00,2984,As far as I know. Give them a call just in case. New ownership. They have a bait fridge and tanks.
729329,bow slayer,2012-09-12 15:02:00,1074,"will do,thanks"
729339,adempsey,2012-09-12 15:34:00,1498,There's a new shop on Wellington and Horton that advertises Live Bait.  Never been in the store yet though.  I think it's called Riverside Tackle.
729349,pylon,2012-09-12 16:02:00,68,"Anglers sport is my first stop  very helpful , top notch stuff"
729350,pylon,2012-09-12 16:02:00,68,"And they had minnows ,leeches last time I was there"
729388,SlowPoke,2012-09-12 18:53:00,2984,"Correct. That's the old ""Shining Tree"" shop that was at Highbury/Huron. Small store, street parking and lower end products. I guess it would be okay for someone; on foot, downtown, looking for live bait."
729601,Acal57,2012-09-13 18:26:00,10,"Sorry to inform you bowslayer, but Arch passed a couple years back. His shop is now some hippy candle emporium. Riverside sucks, they are severely overpriced and do not have minnows contrary to the sign out front. Go to Angling Sports on Adleaide and Commish. They are moving soon to Highbury and Dundas though."
729727,bow slayer,2012-09-14 04:28:00,1074,"  Wow thats to bad about Archie,he was quite the character,i was a very regular customer of his back in the 80s and 90s.Even when he moved into the Hamilton Rd and Adelaide area i was a regular. I thought his son Wes would of took over.  I actually got some minnows from Riverside but they were not cheap. Next time I will stop into Angling Sports ,I recently heard that Ken A. is involved there again."
