728573,fisherkid4,2012-09-09 23:32:00,32,"I was out this weekend fishing a Tributary in the grey Bruce area and i hooked into a nice salmon on my newly purchases float reel (first lake run fish on the knew reel). The river conditions were perfect as it just rained so the water was higher and less clear. Anyways after fighting this fish for about 2mins i was about to land it when it decided to take one last run, breaking my 6lb leader just bellow my bag. Is 6lb fluoro to light for salmon 10lbs and up? or did i just not let the fish run easy enough? do i even need a fluoro lead for salmon when the water is up? what set up do you prefer for fall salmon fishing? i use 8lb maxima mono as mainline and 6lb seagar fluorocarbon.  thanks in advance for any advice,  tight lines!"
728591,bow slayer,2012-09-10 00:32:00,1074,"when water has  12 inches or less visibility who should be good with no leader,using the 8lb main line. Myself and the guys i fish with run 2lb. fluro leaders in clear water,so 6lb should be good. I actually still use 3lb maxima mono as a leader and catch as many as the buddies running the fluro,and it is alot cheaper and more durable."
728620,BillM,2012-09-10 02:31:00,17367,"2lb flouro leads, lol."
728623,ChrisK,2012-09-10 02:42:00,2772, I remember running Maxima 2 to 3lb leaders 25 years ago. Matter of fact I think there still may be some 3 lb around here collecting dust.
728625,Ben_Daniels,2012-09-10 03:22:00,435,My advice would be to not ask for any advice or info on trib fishing on this message board. Its sad but for whatever reason people coming and asking for advice tends to bring out arguments amongst a couple of members. Try to google search what you're looking for because it never ends up well here. Sucks that's legit fishing questions can't be asked on here without it going sour.
728629,Roy,2012-09-10 09:57:00,13728, Yours seems to be the only negative reply Ben.
728643,torco,2012-09-10 13:05:00,656,"Not sure the size of the salmon but 6lbs leader seems too light to me especially when the water is not crystal clear, my advice attempt to get away with the strongest leader you can. 8 or even 10lbs. The faster you can land the fish the better for the fish if you plan to release."
728646,BillM,2012-09-10 13:21:00,17367," Yup, chinnoks aren't line shy.. Although running 8lb main with 8 or 10lb leader might lead to a few lost floats!   Bump up your main a bit, then you'll be able to run a stronger leader.    Although if a fresh chinook decides to take off, it doesn't matter what rig you have, you aren't going to turn it..  Hold on and enjoy!"
728652,Ralph Field,2012-09-10 13:33:00,1018,I agree that say a 12lb. mainline coupled with an 8lb. leader would be a much improved set up for salmon.
728666,sconceptor,2012-09-10 14:30:00,146,"14 or 20lb braid on the pin, fireline crystal, or super line like Berkley Nano....will cost a pretty penny to spool it up, but no line twist, lot fewer break offs, and removing line every other trip...get a few seasons out of it, vs. respooling every few weeks if you fish lots...use a 8 or 10lb shot line, and for steelhead tie on a couple feet of 6lb flouro, salmon, bump things up a few pounds(8lb flouro, 12lb shot line??) when fish are close to shore and you, your rod is bowed so much some times, let out some line so if the fish goes again, the rod will have some give, line wouldn't just snap"
728672,BillM,2012-09-10 15:10:00,17367,"If you're filling your entire spool with braid, you're doing something wrong..  I only ever buy 1 spool to fill the pin, the rest is backing..  150yrds is more then enough, I've never come close to the backing, regardless of where I'm fishing (Even early season estuary chinook fishing)"
728683,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 15:38:00,2710,Because I stopped steelheading just as braid was coming in. What Bill in your opinion is the best reason for using it? The lack of stretch? I use to run 8 lb xt with 4 lb flouro for everything(least stretch of the mono available) and would just break the boots off unless I got them while the shakers were in @ labour day at china straight.
728696,FrankTheRabbit,2012-09-10 16:36:00,479,"10lb chinnies is definitely close to minimum, but possible to work with. If you found a break just above your bag, a knot failure might even be possible.  I found beefing up my mainline (12lb) and stronger leader (8lb) resulted in bent hooks (size 10 raven octopus strong hooks). If you use a beefy mainline and leader, consider stronger gauge hooks (lik size 6 or 8)."
728740,sconceptor,2012-09-10 18:37:00,146,"Yeah, what's 150yd or 300yd spool of braid worth versus a spool of 10lb raven/andres?  There's so much value in a 300yd spool of braid, do 3 reels for a few years.  Initial cost of braid is high, but have it has lots of value!"
728773,misfish,2012-09-10 20:10:00,29133,"Im running 12# Raven main line,and Maxima 6# lead right now. Can,t comment on how it works.Still waiting for my first salmon hook up on the pin."
728779,davey buoy,2012-09-10 20:25:00,5505," A lot of pin fisherman elsewhere has been saying run 20 or 30lb braid with backing than run a micro swivel under your float. The floats have a line running out side the float,so line twist there is not a problem. Adding a leader of fluro after the swivel 6lb from what I am now hearing is the cats .Still have to let the rod do the work and allow the reel to take off when need be. LANDED.lol. Remember braid does not have any memory and lasts for at least a year or three and than some."
728781,fisherkid4,2012-09-10 20:30:00,32,"Thanks for the help, i think il bump up my mainline if the problem continues because i just spent 15$ on that spool of maxima and its still fresh im too cheap to waste it! next time il just try and take my time and let the fish tire out before i try and land it i guess.  tight lines,"
728782,davey buoy,2012-09-10 20:35:00,5505," Your exactly right. One time thou with a spinning set up,the salmon took off full speed south.Nothing I could do,spooled me. That was years ago,and haven't had that happen since.Thank god lol.Puts a bit of a damper on day!."
728785,fishinguypat,2012-09-10 20:51:00,547, You're kidding right?
728786,BillM,2012-09-10 20:51:00,17367,"  The 100yrd hero hooksets, lol.  Besides direct contact to the fish (Which is really nice compared to mono), it also doesn't twist like mono with the side cast.   I run 6lb Nanofil on my lighter setup (Loomis IM6 + Frogwater) and my casting distance is silly.   I can also mend like it crazy...  I love the stuff until the below zero temps come, after that the ice will rip to shreds.  I run 8lb Drennan Super Specialist once that weather gets here."
728817,Musky or Specks,2012-09-10 22:18:00,2710,"Yes I can see were the mending would be handy, I even use that aspect of braid river smallie fishing"
728833,danc,2012-09-10 22:54:00,4677,"Apparently trib fishing has became much more complicated since it was the sole reason for my existance. I just used 10 or 12 lb. stren. The purple glow of the line was awesome!! No leader. No swivel. No float. My setup back then was a 9' fiberglass Fenwick fly rod coupled with a Martin 72 multiplier (3 to 1) fly reel. I was a bottom bouncer and fished waters that made a bottle of gin look cloudy, and caught fish out the wazoo. I guess that the fish are smarter now then they were 25 years ago."
728836,davey buoy,2012-09-10 23:00:00,5505,"I don't think so Dan ,they just catch more now.lol. Under all different conditions."
728972,Musky or Specks,2012-09-11 04:42:00,2710,"Not smarter maybe, but a heck of a lot more pressured."
