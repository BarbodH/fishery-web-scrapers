I know of some rivers up there off the saugeen, but i dont know what flies are best to use(new to fly fishing). Im going to try the north river, formosa cr, beatty saugeen and lucknow river, any info on wheres good entry points would be awesome. If anyone knows of better rivers for trout, please pm me."
729208,SirCranksalot,2012-09-12 00:25:00,3291,I didn't think there was a North River near the Saugeen. Do you mean the one in Simcoe Cty?
729221,BillM,2012-09-12 01:03:00,17367,Going to be hard pressed for people to give out info about any of the trout rivers in Grey/Bruce.  My suggestion is to look at Google maps and go from there.
729248,ChrisK,2012-09-12 02:21:00,2772,To help you with the fly pattern that may catch you a fish in a trout stream this time of year. Try using caddis fly mergers or pupas in a size 18 or smaller.  There are many others to choose from but this one should do it and most fly shops will have variations of them in stock... Good Luck

729359,Wencell,2012-09-12 16:51:00,17,"thanks for the response everyone , i know its a subject not alot of anglers want to tell you about . Just thought i'd try."
