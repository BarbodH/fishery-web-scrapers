729697,kickingfrog,2012-09-14 01:33:00,8333,I am looking for a counter balanced power handle for a Calcutta 400TE.  The power handle for the Calcutta B 400 does not fit 400TE.  I did some searches and checked ebay but thought I'd check here as well.  Thanks for the help.

729801,kickingfrog,2012-09-14 18:05:00,8333,Thanks Boss.  Have dealt with them before?
729806,BucktownAngler,2012-09-14 18:40:00,582,"  No, but all the guys on a musky forum get their power handles from there. So pretty reputable company."
729808,kickingfrog,2012-09-14 18:45:00,8333,"Thanks, sent an email.  Not sure how I forgot the ""you"" in ""Have you dealt with them?"""
729859,F_ast,2012-09-14 22:20:00,154,"If anyone is looking to get rid of a original handle for the 400TE, let me know."
729860,kickingfrog,2012-09-14 22:56:00,8333,The search continues. Dave's Reel is sold out.

729874,Gregoire,2012-09-14 23:56:00,1397,"I got one for my conquest 401 earlier this year from Aikman's but at the time that was the last one he had in stock. The handle is ok, but the balance seems a little off. I have a buddy who had his calcutta TE 400 serviced in Peterborough and they added a power handle to his. I would phone both of these places first to see what they have. Ebay has some as well, but I personally don't like the way they look.  F_ast, I have an original handle from my conquest 401 with the assembly as well that I will not be using. Drop me a PM if you are interested."
