726176,LucG,2012-08-30 18:05:00,779,"I know, summer is not over yet! But it has been a long time since my last report so I'd though I'd compress it all into one.  It has been a very busy summer, most my time has been spent fishing or working. I competed in several tournaments for both pike and bass, with some decent placings. Also spent every free minute of my time learning new water and mastering new technics.  This year I focused on drop shotting for smallies, I experimented with all kinds of line, hooks and bait. I've narrowed it down to using 12 lb seagar fluro, using 1/0 owner wacky hooks. My best bait has been using either the 3"" or the 4"" senkos (wacky rigged on the dropshot) Also unsing 6'9"" Med-Hvy, fast action St-croix mojo bass paired up with a Quantum Smoke Spinning reel. This is one of my new favorite technics for summertime smallie.  As for largies, I focused my attention on flipping. This year I went to a longer rod: Kistler 7'8"" telescopic Hvy. This really helped in not only pulling these fish from the thickest cover, but also helped on my flipping acuracy. Using 65 lbs braid, spooled on a 7:3:1 gear ratio Quantum Smoke Baitcaster. Owner 5/0 hooks and a tungsten weight.  Anyways, almost done work, time to go fishing!  Here are a few pics, enjoy!  1st Place - Nipissing - North Bay Bassmasters   1st Place - Nosbonsing - North Bay Bassmasters   Couple smallies on the drop shot.
