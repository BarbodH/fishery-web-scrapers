729139,Chance,2012-09-11 20:57:00,420,"  Sounds great ,was looking at launching from Island marina..good idea or no ?"
729140,EC1,2012-09-11 20:58:00,930,"Had a terrible evening last Friday. Had a 12"" LMB hit 3 times and finally caught it. That was also it for the rest of the day. I'm sure scugog is always good for bass... well if you can find 'em!"
729145,Chance,2012-09-11 21:01:00,420,  Sounds like a persistant lil bugger. One is better than a skunk !
729146,Chance,2012-09-11 21:03:00,420, I run a Ranger with a 250 on the back.

729150,Christopheraaron,2012-09-11 21:19:00,3525, Except for all those pesky locks! I may not be the sharpest in accounting but after looking at maps of ontario for years you become pretty good at geography! LOL
729152,Christopheraaron,2012-09-11 21:21:00,3525,So i guess he just flies over them?
729156,Christopheraaron,2012-09-11 21:28:00,3525,Anything's possible in a 250!
729164,Chance,2012-09-11 22:00:00,420,"  Yep,trouble is you cn only do it once so watch closely."
729247,GBW,2012-09-12 02:19:00,8460,"Best post in a while!  Could have been better, added ""here hold my beer and watch this"""
