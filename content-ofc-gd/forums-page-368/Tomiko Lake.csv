728846,Rob,2012-09-10 23:42:00,467,"Well I'm going there for the weekend to Okimot Lodge (Tomiko spelled backwards!). Really looking forward to this trip as I have been doing renos at the house and man I am getting tired of it!  So this lake looks quite promising, and I am hoping for a nice fish fry. I was just wondering what colours, bait or lure types to try out up there. I would suspect the water temp should be good and cold by then and they would head to usual fall structure. If anyone has tips or suggestions it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Rob"
