102838,Greencoachdog,2007-08-11 02:04:00,8163,I volunteered to scub out the insides of all (about 12) the Port-O-Lets on the jobsite... 'cause sometimes you find loose pocket change!!!
102840,Roy,2007-08-11 02:20:00,13728,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  sure beats doing nothing eh?
102848,GbayGiant,2007-08-11 03:09:00,1780,"Hey Lew, I'm a little late this year getting the gear organized, but I'm fairly close to Lakair, If your ever in the area on the way home or too and interested in going out on the bay, just give me a PM bud, could be interesting.  Never know what you could find.  Have fun fellas."
102855,Beans,2007-08-11 03:43:00,3339,"Going to try to christen my new carp rod again...missed one today...forgot to turn the handle of the reel to take it off ''free spool"" before I lifted the rod causing the reel to back spin...by the time I got the line straightened out the carp was gone...  That makes it Carp...4 Beans...0...(just getting warmed up...  )"
102857,Hooked,2007-08-11 03:55:00,891,"Probably no fishing, but gonna take the family to a local conservation area where they will be playing Spiderman 3 on a 40'x40' inflatable screen.  Impressive picture and sound, should be fun for all.  Any of you in the Hamilton area should check it out, Saturday night at Christie Conservation Area."
102865,fatherof3,2007-08-11 06:39:00,1769,get the boys out as much as possible.Thinking Whitemans or hamilton or both
102880,Rich Clemens,2007-08-11 12:26:00,3131,"No fishing this week-end.  My new toy, Lowrance LCX 28C HD is being installed today.   At least it is supposed to be.  Anxious to get the boat back, everything put back in, and take it out.  Should be a very neat system.  (Yeah ... she must still love me)"
102892,Carp,2007-08-11 14:12:00,1488," I've never heard of that position, but heck, I'll try anything once.   Don't forget the pictures Joey.    No need for pictures on this one Glenn ? Shirtless or not. Rednecks ......I'll never understand.    Yippee, the weekend is here. Think I'll kick back and relax. Chill all weekend. Sounds great, but unfortunately...............   Yesterday the kids were delivered to my parents house to stay overnight because we had a friends 40th birthday party.  Today I'll be doing some work for a client and if there's time, rig electrical power from the house to my shed.  Tonight we have another friends 40th, but can only stay for a short time because........  My bro and sister in-law are having a get together / BBQ with their wedding party. It's been 9 yrs.  Tomorrow morning I'm planning to get the kids out on L.Ontario for a few hours to catch some salmon and trout.  When I get home, I have more work around the house and will probably have to go visit a client in the evening.  I don't have time to P. This is nuts. I need a 10 day week and 30 hrs. in a day.  Retirement can't come fast enough for me. "
102911,FishHeadRic,2007-08-11 16:48:00,226,I'm heading down to Long Island on Saturday nite and should be in the surf by Sunday Morning sometime before noon. Not sure as to when I'll be back. Looks like my papers have finally gone through to move down so this might be a permanent Vacation for me...  FHR
102920,danbouck,2007-08-11 17:36:00,4380,Just got home from work. Now I'm planning on testing my new to me trolling motor from danbo the rest of the day followed by a nice day of playing golf in Oakville tomorrow! Maybe i'll have some spare time to spend with the family.
102921,Jen,2007-08-11 17:42:00,833,"Going to  sort out my tackle, make a shopping list of all that I need to replace because it was lost and all I need to buy to just have more stuff... bar b que in the yard with the kids and then the Festival of Friends...  Tomorrow is fishing ... or atleast I can hope...  Cheers,  Jen"
102974,Canuck2fan,2007-08-11 22:50:00,1444,"I had to work for 2 hrs this morning but lucked out and got to go fishing... I finished up my route right down the street from my favourite bassing hole. I arranged my deliveries in the order to make that work out. I also had the foresight to have a dozen leeches, 24 crayfish and two fishing poles on the van. Did pretty good hit 4 buckets and 10 smallies in less than 2 hours, not too bad considering it was from 10 to noon with some of clearest water I have fished in a long time. Watching those bass come from 25 feet away to smack the bait was AWESOME. I even caught one of the buckets on a bare hook I was reeling in.  Now the only trouble is I was going to get up early Sunday and drive about 40 miles to fish a river off Lake Huron, but now I might just save the fuel and go back to where I had such good luck today... Especially if looks like rain as promised in the morning."

102666,lew,2007-08-10 13:00:00,12767," Congrats on the upcoming nuptuals Bitssmith2k, but If your marrying the right girl, your free weekends will never end.  Were married 41 years this October, yet I still spend nearly as much time away fish'n & camping as I do at home........course maybe that's the way she like it  BTW, I'll be in a green Crestliner with a black Merc motor"
102667,mcallister.grant,2007-08-10 13:08:00,327,"As per usual, I will be making my way to some lock or dam in search of the notorious walleye. That will take me to 3 or 4 am and I will spend the rest of the weekend with my wife and son. Maybe go to Taste of the Danforth. They have great food down there BTW.  Have a fun and safe weekend everyone!!!"

Tomorrow, I've got dinner with the 3 other guys who are going with me to Fushimi Lake PP in a couple of weeks.  Will be a good time of planning, sharing stories, and talking about how the next 2 weeks can't go by fast enough!!  I'm sure I'll get some pond fishing in there also, as my 2 year old, just got his first fishing pole and is iching to try it out!!  Everyone have a great weekend, and looking forward to the reports (and pictures)  dk"
