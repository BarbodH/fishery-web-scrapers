102750,dustink,2007-08-10 19:17:00,526,"Just got this e-mailed to me, and it worked on me.  I'm curious if we've got any drummers or other folks who play an instrument can do this....  How smart is Your Right Foot ? ?  This will boggle your mind and you will keep trying over and over again to See if you can outsmart your foot, but, you can't. It's preprogrammed In your brain!  1. WITHOUT anyone watching you (they will think you are GOOFY......) and While sitting where you are at your desk in front of your computer, lift Your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.  2. Now, while doing this, draw the number ""6"" in the air with your right Hand.  Your foot will change direction.  I told you so!!! And there's nothing you can do about it!  You and I both know how stupid it is, but before the day is done you are Going to try it again, if you've not already done so."

102757,misfish,2007-08-10 19:27:00,29133,Thats too cool. My foot was wagging. L M A O  TFS   LOL Just had the wife do it aswell.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
102762,ADC,2007-08-10 19:41:00,82,"yep,  as soon as I start the bottom of the 6 all hell breaks loose.  Doesnt work with 9 either"
102763,Tacklebuster,2007-08-10 19:45:00,303,"there is a trick to it.  The reason you might find it difficult is that your hand and foot are moving in opposite directions.  As you draw the 6, try drawing it in the opposite direction you normally would, its much easier."
102764,motv8tr,2007-08-10 19:51:00,2587,"I can do it, but then I've always been different  Maureen"
102768,Terry,2007-08-10 20:06:00,14456,I was able to do it  but I had to take a long time making the 6 while  only concentrating on making circles with my foot and not thinking about making the 6
