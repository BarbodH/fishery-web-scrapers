37733,huntervasili,2007-02-21 21:55:00,1604,Wondering what Kind of line you guys use on tip-ups... What do you prefer and for what species and Lb test...
37740,walleyejigger,2007-02-21 22:02:00,876,"i voted for mono, but it's ""ice"" mono, so maybe it falls under tip-up specific  on my ice rods i use regular mono"
37775,gone_fishin,2007-02-21 22:36:00,481,"tip-ups are sensitive enough, no need for added sensitivity with a superline. i've got mono on all of mine."
37862,Motorhead,2007-02-22 00:33:00,163,I use the Stren mono ice-fishing in 4 lb test on my tip-up and fireline in 8 lb test on my ice fishing rod...
37924,troutologist,2007-02-22 01:33:00,951,The stretch factor in mono is nice when handbombing a fish in. my manual drag still needs some tuning
37943,pidge,2007-02-22 01:55:00,438,Yeah I'm with Clampet. Just bought a tip up at the show last Friday and spooled it with 10 lbs Trilene. Used it for the first time Saturday no problems. Caught a pike on it to.
38321,PatB,2007-02-22 17:54:00,104,"I use the black tip-up line, with a mono leader."
38436,dsn,2007-02-22 21:55:00,1018,I didn't vote on any of the above cause I use a combination of lines. I fish in 60-70 feet of water. I don't like the stretch in mono at that depth. I need to be quick and set the hook hard. So I use 14lb power-pro main line and 20-30 feet of flourocarbon so the fish don't see the line.   dsn
103141,Roy,2007-08-12 21:39:00,13728,I hate polls....I'll start a new one tonight.
103155,Fisherman,2007-08-12 22:44:00,7201,"Berkley Micro Ice, 4 or 6lb"
