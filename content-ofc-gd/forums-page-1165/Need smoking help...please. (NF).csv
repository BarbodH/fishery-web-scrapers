103064,Roy,2007-08-12 13:33:00,13728,"OK, so I've only tried a few pieces of salmon and walleye in the smoker and they were ummmm pretty good. So yesterday I went and got myself a piece of a$$ (pork)...about 10 pounds and I'm looking for a reasonably easy recipe. I know that I'm probably looking at  24 hours of this and 24 hours of that.....maybe I can get it done for Easter? Would anyone here be kind enough to share a not too long recipe? If it's your Grandma's secret recipe, you can PM me. Thanks."
103066,Bernie,2007-08-12 13:38:00,3190,"Seen the message and I thought you wanted to quit smoking   . You know, one of those give me some support kinda things."
103067,aniceguy,2007-08-12 13:39:00,1094,"drop the pork in a large bowl mix in 2 cups brown sugar, 1/2 cup molassas, 3 tbs crushed garlic, 2 tbs parirka, 1tbs, basil, 3tbs finley chopped onions, 1 tsp dijion musturd or any other grain mustard and 3 cups dry white wine  Let soak for at least 3 hours. Set the smoker for a hot smoke for a solid 1/1/2 hrs then if you can set it for a cold smoke for 9 hrs"
103069,Roy,2007-08-12 13:56:00,13728,Thanks...doesn't need to be cured first?

103104,aniceguy,2007-08-12 17:14:00,1094,you can if you want but a quick salt with kosher salt prior to the hot smoke does the job
103105,glen,2007-08-12 17:18:00,2641,Roy try drinking beer it is way easier to smoke when drinking.
103107,addict,2007-08-12 17:55:00,475,i used to use a bong or a nice pipe saves time on rolling just chop it up fine and light er up
103321,JFR,2007-08-13 12:32:00,498,"Hi Roy, What type of pork do you have, shoulder, loin or ham?  Here is a site that will help you step by step: These are recipes for doing a shoulder or ""butt""  http://virtualweberbullet.com/porkbuttselect.html  http://virtualweberbullet.com/pork1.html  http://virtualweberbullet.com/pork3.html  http://virtualweberbullet.com/pork2.html  This is for cooking a ""loin""  http://virtualweberbullet.com/porkloin1.html  These recipes are designed for using a charcoal smoker, but I have used a gas smoker with great results.  The main thing Roy, is low and slow, plan on spending at least 6-24 hours cooking this meat.  The man who owns and runs the webpage is an engineering geek, therefore, all the precise times on his charts.  All you have to remember is low heat 200-225 F and slow 6-24 hours  John"
