I asked Don to do me a favor and he went out of his way to pick up a rod and reel that KyleM had posted in the classifieds. Kyle, Don says the rod and reel are in excellent condition! Jeesh from the sounds of it I might have a problem getting it away from him What more can I say, another good deed performed by an OFC'er.  THANK YOU! Don and Ruth and Thanks Kyle we helped each other out and good luck in Alberta.  Cheers  Phil"
102927,Roy,2007-08-11 18:04:00,13728,"Don and Ruth are very nice folks. (I especially like Ruth.) You'll be happy with that combo Phil. That'll have been the best deal you've made this year. I have two now.....they are too good for the price and you even got it at half price....great stuff. Notice that on that rod there's a hole in the trigger to  hook your bait into. If you're trolling with a 6' leader, there's no other place to park the bait...Great great combo, you'll love it.  An OFC thank you to Don for being the gent that he is."
102929,SlowPoke,2007-08-11 18:29:00,2984,"It doesn't surprise me that Don would go out of his way. Don and I go wayyyy back, June in fact when we were neighbours for 4 days. It's Ruth you have to keep an eye on, after dark she would sneak over while Don was sleeping and drink our beer.  Phil, I hope you can make it up again next year in June. I wanted to go next weekend but it just wasn't do-able. I wish I had Lew's schedule! -Brian"
102930,Roy,2007-08-11 18:35:00,13728,*makes mental note to have the cabin next to Don and Ruth next year.*
103046,Blake,2007-08-12 05:42:00,418,This is a great board with awesome members.  Great to see these good deeds.
103111,Carp,2007-08-12 18:10:00,1488,Don and Ruth are super people. Nice to hear stories like this. Makes me proud to be a part of the OFC.
103308,Whopper,2007-08-13 11:54:00,2174,Roy I already have one and your right for the money you can't beat it. I really didn't need another but I'm taking my son up this week to fish for some toothy critters and I didn't want him to do without.  Cheers  Whopper
