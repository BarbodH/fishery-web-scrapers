102447,Pete Maina,2007-08-09 17:02:00,213,"Hey, good news on all of that. I'll let John know.  Pete"
102580,Crazyhook,2007-08-10 01:24:00,1154,"Marc in a dress! AAARRGH!  great work on the pics guys... some real beauties. I am really missing the great Musky, going to fix that this week. Hoping for one on the fly as well..."
102665,pat28,2007-08-10 13:00:00,3,"Hey Pete! I'm the sot who got the behemoth that missed your bait... A good reason to hate me, especially when the guy wearing a dress wakes you up when you have a terrible cold to tell you all about it. Anyway... For the pics, I certainly did not leave the smiles on shore!  Pat "
102676,Roy,2007-08-10 13:20:00,13728,Welcome aboard Pat. Yes Marc mentioned something about that. You picked that one up two days later?
102709,pat28,2007-08-10 15:47:00,3,"Yep! Caught it on the cast. It grabbed the bait some 3-6 feet from the boat. And best of all, it is back into the water! Tight lines!  Pat"
102711,darsky,2007-08-10 15:50:00,586,"Goddam--put a potbelly on her and she could contend for a wr-well,maybe. That's one of the biggest I've seen from Marc. Take that Legend-LOL"
102714,Pete Maina,2007-08-10 16:27:00,213,"Hi All,  Hey Pat. Congrats man  Great pic ... don't hate you at all ... better you than me. I've caught my share ... since it's still swimming, I've got a reason to try again  ....  but that dress, yikes  It's never all good news.  Serious congrats though man. So, is the strike stuck in your head a bit?  Pete"
102716,fishnsled,2007-08-10 16:38:00,3520,Some great fish there gentlemen and Marc.
102889,pat28,2007-08-11 13:45:00,3,"Hey again Pete!  I still have those old strikes of 50+ fish in my mind, but a fish this size appearing out of nowhere some 3-6 feet to the boat and grabbing the lure will remain engraved in my memory forever. This is when one's memory appears to get into automatic slow motion mode...  Tight lines!  Pat"
102909,Pete Maina,2007-08-11 16:37:00,213,"Hey Pat,  Yeah, I'll bet your eyes got a little big when she appeared.  Best,  Pete"
101992,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-08 09:41:00,621,Here's a few from last 8 days or so

102000,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-08 10:20:00,621," I know,some never listen ""why do I even do this to myself"" How humiliating Those that can get the Gillespie show,it will be airing this coming weekend and episode #2,the following weekend.Some real good fishing and crazy footage Old Twitty lost a monster the last day but we got her 2 days ago We are trying to get the Gillesp on WFN,in hopes this coming winter you will see the Gillesp on a channel near you!

102006,Roy,2007-08-08 11:04:00,13728,"As a side note, the man with the yellow shirt is Marty and Tony's dad, Ed. He came to dinner that very night. He'd changed his shirt but was still wearing that very same grin. He was one happy camper and a great guy."

102054,darsky,2007-08-08 13:27:00,586,Marc-over a year ago you (or someone) put up a TNB show with you for download here. Can it be done for Gillesp's show for those that don't get the channel? And Pete said no real tankers........
102064,Roy,2007-08-08 14:06:00,13728,I think I put one up last year Darren. The shows will have to air first then we'll see if John and the others are ok with us posting it.

102226,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-08 22:44:00,621," Dude I am soryy,really I mean it  Glen,I agree The Legend Fish's The African Naughty Minnow  Spent some wonderful time and lots of laugh again so far this year,just some moments that were special shared. Ed is Marty's Dad,who is just the most hilarious fellow I have ever come across I only wish I could be on Nip with them just to see Captain Ed  Yell "" Reel My Friend Reel """
102362,Pete Maina,2007-08-09 13:17:00,213,"HI OFNers,  Marc had sent along a link here. So I had to stop in and see what kind of crazyness was going on. I was hoping someone posted a shot of Marc trolling in that dress, but I don't see it here. Oh well. (Pretty ugly deal when he nets a fish.)  Hey Roy ... was great to see you while we were out there. Appreciate the hospitality. Thankyou. And you tell your lovely bride she's a great cook/chef/host and thank her again for me.  Dunno about those boat rules of no smiling ... really hard not to laugh at a guy fishing in a skirt.  Pete"
102410,Roy,2007-08-09 15:15:00,13728,"It was a pleasure Pete. Tell John not to feel too bad. We were able to put out the fire in the den then after a few days, all the water had dried out of the carpets."
