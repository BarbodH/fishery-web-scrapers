When it's dark you want to watch North East direction, it's suppose to be exceptionally good this year.  Also on Tuesday I went fishing at Toronto Islands since my friend backed out of Silent Lake, didn't catch anything . I use floats/bait and little plastic red and yellow squid on a hook from the shore. Nothing seemed to work and I changed spots many times. It sucked that I didn't catch anything but the day was relaxing and worth it. I am kinda new to fishing so does anyone have any suggestions what else I can use besides live bait and a floater. Also other things that are in season right now to fish for besides Bass."

102871,Roy,2007-08-11 10:54:00,13728,Be out in the dark with no city lights...you'll see them much better. Just a fantastic show. Don't forget to face East and bring a camera.
102887,OhioFisherman,2007-08-11 13:21:00,6623,"The sky is falling?  Artem get a fishing regulation book they should be available where fishing licenses are sold. Usually seasons are closed during the spawn but can vary. Most should be open now.  A lot of baits (lures) will work, some are good for a variety of species. If you are new don`t go overboard and buy a bunch of stuff you may not use. A simple in line spinner like a Mepps will work, a hard bait like a rattle trap, soft plastics, 3 inch grub on a ball head jig.  Different species have different habits, areas they prefer, food, but a lot of cross over. Squid? Like a tube? Small tube lures will catch fish, the fish have to be there though."

102907,mcallister.grant,2007-08-11 16:12:00,327,Do you think there is chance of seeing it in Toronto? Or will the only thing falling be dead birds from the astrnomically (no pun intended) low air quality index?
102917,danbouck,2007-08-11 17:28:00,4380,  lol good luck!
103033,Artem,2007-08-12 04:31:00,11,Well about now is when the show is on. Everyone take a gander to the North East and hopefully you'll see something.
