103248,canadianguy33,2007-08-13 04:20:00,121,"I've tried Bell Express View and the Cogeco digital package and I didn't really care for either considering the price.  I thought the movie channels would be a lot better than they were, but the movies are mostly lame and repeat a lot,  so now I just have the regular 62 channels through Cogeco which suits me fine.  For the last month though, I've been watching TV mostly through the internet.  I discovered VeohTV (from www.veoh.com) so I hooked my old computer up to my big screen and watch ""TV"" through the internet.  I have a remote control that cost me $40 for my computer and I surf the web for videos, movies, tv shows, etc. all from the comfort of my couch.  Believe it or not, I think internet television is going to be huge.  I mean, just using this veohTV thing, which is brand new, I already have over 200 channels of on demand video for free.  The only thing you need is a broadband internet connection.  O yea, I'm a website designer so naturally I'm a computer geek."

On the upside, I don't lose the signal too often.  I have used Star Choice several years ago, but had nothing but problems, especially with the Pay-Per-View, they could have fixed it now though.  If I could, I'd do the cable thing in a heartbeat.  Maureen"

103353,ricoboxing,2007-08-13 14:27:00,398,The best provider is my VHF/UHF antenna.  VHF = $10 UHF= $10 roof Tripod = $10 monthly charge =$0  Total cost = $30 # of channels = 15  amount of time saved by not watching as much TV cause of the crappy channel selection = priceless
