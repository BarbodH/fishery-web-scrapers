102312,sharper,2007-08-09 04:12:00,279,do croc's come in black or navy a more manly color versus the bright colors i have seen? also how much are they?
102316,fatherof3,2007-08-09 04:43:00,1769,have seen more manly crocs in black at CT. not sure of price though
102372,dustink,2007-08-09 13:48:00,526," Come in lots of colors, and they retail for about $30.00 USD - Croc's Website  I suppose if the boat was kept as tidy as Lew/Marc's I would give the barefoot a go...I just like the bit of support / feeling wearing something give me.....  dk"
102476,addy79,2007-08-09 19:14:00,573,C-R-O-C-S!
102482,SlowPoke,2007-08-09 19:35:00,2984,"I'm glad I'm not the only one wearing croc's - olive green. When my wife brought them home for me I didn't want to leave the house with them.... I felt like an idiot wearing them but they are so comfortable. Especially for fishing. Now I feel like an idoit when I'm not wearing them - damn croc tan lines. They're way better than watershoes too, they dry out in seconds but I wouldn't want to tread across the zebra mussles in them. -Brian"
102521,Bly,2007-08-09 21:56:00,1556,"  I will agree that they are ugly but I can think of a few other ""shoe fads"" that IMHO were worse.....does anyone remember the ""jelly shoes"" in the 1980's??  To me, the funny thing about crocs........5 years ago I bought a pair of ""gardening shoes"" from Canadian Tire for 12.99 wore them out of the garden/house a few times and everyone teased me.....one person (complete stranger) even made a snide comment about how his mother only wore those sort of shoes gardening.  Now they are a hot fashion fad called Crocs!  Go figure  lol"
102981,scuro,2007-08-11 23:35:00,386,I did go barefoot....I didn't step on a hook....I slipped during a light rain and went flying. My foot caught the bottom of a metal seat. I had a nice cut and couldn't walk for a few days. I'll always wear something in the boat now.
103003,canadianguy33,2007-08-12 02:10:00,121,I keep a really messy boat so I always wear running shoes.  I'm kind of surprised at how popular crocs are though.  I thought my mom was the only that wore those things. lol
102051,dustink,2007-08-08 13:13:00,526,"I was looking at the pics that Marc posted, and noticed in the one picture it appeared he was barefooted.  Lots of big hooks on those baits......  Wondering....what do most of you do for footwear on the water?  I have a pair of Teva sandals I wear (don't forget the sunscreen) that leave some pretty wicked tan lines.  In fact I've a got a great little painting from Pam of my feet up on the boat wearing my sandals.  I also really like my Crocs, and wear them most of the summer (oh, they're bright orange, too....so they stand out a bit).  Lots of guys sling some pretty big hooks, and I can think of few things worse than a trebble hook in the top or bottom of the foot.   Over 100*F here today with the heat index.....remember to drink lots of water before you get out there to keep hydrated.  later, dk"
102052,Raf,2007-08-08 13:22:00,3495,i'd go barefoot but I forget to apply sunscreen on them so I usually just fish in socks until the cold weather arrives.
102059,lew,2007-08-08 13:39:00,12767,"I like to be barefoot in the boat  too, but I keep a very neat boat and if the baits aren't being used, their hung up on the wire, safely outta the way. I find if there's a safe & convenient place to keep them, I'm more inclined to put them back.  I've seen too many folks just drop baits on the floor of the boat when their not being used and a 7/0 treble in the sole of your foot isn't a pretty sight  Even when I catch a fish and he's in the net, the hooks are removed and the bait is hung on the outside of the boat till I'm done dealing with a fish.  Unfortunately it won't be too many more months till were wearing fleece lined boots in the boat while sliding around the deck on the ice.......dang  Hang them up and you don't need to worry about where they are    "
102071,Joey,2007-08-08 14:26:00,9122,"I go barefoot most of the time, and if I get a big fish that I bring into the boat, I stand on the seat so there's less chance of getting one in the foot.  Also I have Paul to get in there if need be and do the dirty work, he never goes barefoot in the boat.  Joey"
102074,Headhunter,2007-08-08 14:31:00,5703,"Never go barefoot in a boat! Bugs, hooks all prevent me from even considering it as an option. I like my runners and the secure feeling of freedom they allow me to have! HH"
102075,OhioFisherman,2007-08-08 14:31:00,6623,"The carpeting in mine is dark brown and black like an astro turf also very hot like asphault, flip-flops in summer track shoes when it is cooler. I would kick them off once in a while though."
102079,mattyk,2007-08-08 14:37:00,2110,i like to wear my runners if im fishing a long day.
102086,Roy,2007-08-08 14:45:00,13728,"I always wear shoes in the boat but that's because I run a sloppy boat. As far as Marc is concerned, being on his boat is akin to being in the navy. NOTHING is out of place. If he has two rods out, there are only two baits out and they're underwater. You'd swear he has no fishing tackle. The only thing loose on his boat is the pliers and bolt cutters and they are hooked to the rod mounts with 4' stainless cable.  But it is a good idea to make sure kids wear some kind of footwear."
102090,banger,2007-08-08 14:47:00,95,"Sandals for me, untill the snow comes.  What tan lines. "
102092,bigfish1965,2007-08-08 14:48:00,3382,I always wear shoes. Never know when I'm going to step on something and having the tops of my feet burnt is an experience I don't wish to repeat.
102099,Tacklebuster,2007-08-08 14:59:00,303,"shoes or sandals, its too easy for a single snell to escape the tackle box without noticing, and that is one experience I will do my best to avoid."
102101,Zamboni,2007-08-08 15:01:00,235,"Cut my foot Saturday on Rice lake, stepped on glass in water just beside beach area of golden beach resort. Kids tubing, I jumped out to hold boat while my buddy set up his little guy. Crocs laying on floor of boat, I often kick them off driving around and fishing. What kind of moron throws his beer bottle in the lake-see it in parks/playgrounds in Whitby also-what are they thinking. Going to wear sandals in boat from now on-never know.  Bright note, the cheap Airhead tube at Wal Mart is terrific-squirrly ride at slow speeds (20mph) Things unstable, sits too high in water not even close to overinflated....kids loved it. No need to drive fast to dump them or have them 'catch air'....slight turn whips the tube outside the wake. Kids really enjoyed this tube (Cyclone)....the 'expert' dads didn't-got dumped too easily."
102109,Joey,2007-08-08 15:19:00,9122,"As I mentioned above, Paul always wears footwear in the boat, but sometimes its hot, so I got him these funky new sandals I found on Ebay.  They kept his feet cool and his feet didn't burn at all on the weekend and we were in the boat every day for three days.    Joey"
102117,fishindevil,2007-08-08 15:38:00,6254,Well for me its sandals & crocs..  ...my permanent tan lines shows it quite well...lol..lol..lol    cheers
102119,misfish,2007-08-08 15:44:00,29133,"What a croc,I mean I wear crocs."
102121,MJL,2007-08-08 15:51:00,2427,"I don't have the luxury of owning a boat or fishing from one often but when I fish from my canoe (and plan to get my feet wet often), I wear Columbia water-shoes  These ones   They come with mesh uppers and drainage holes in the sole.  I've never gotten sunburned while wearing them."
102126,jediangler,2007-08-08 16:04:00,1923,I wear neoprene water shoes in the kayak and running shoes in the canoe. If I'm musky fishing in a rental boat I wear green patch hiking shoes. Safety first.
102128,Rich,2007-08-08 16:10:00,3927,Barefoot in my boat you might as well be walking on a bed of nails! lol
102131,Bly,2007-08-08 16:19:00,1556,"Usually wear runners whether fishing from shore or a boat.  I have very tender (read girly) feet, going barefoot is painful most of the time.  Since getting the canoe I am considering a pair of water socks...safety, comfort and no worries if they get wet!  "
102132,Tdel,2007-08-08 16:22:00,393,"Running shoes or Ducky's for me in the boat.  When I was younger I was able to walk bare feet on pebbles, stones, almost anything and have no problem what so ever.  Now I am like the Princess and the Pea or should I say the Prince & the Pea.  Tom"
102135,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-08 16:31:00,1351,"i rarely wear sandals in the boat, 1) i dont want to have hooks in my feet 2) i don't feel like getting a tan/burn on my foot"
102166,drufis,2007-08-08 18:37:00,45,Crocs for all the way  My brother in laws feet used to hurt at the end of a fishing day (he would wear running shoes) I got him a pair of crocs and now he wears nothing else but and says his feet don't hurt after a day of fishing.
102208,aplumma,2007-08-08 21:29:00,6896,tennis shoes or sandles but have no issues with barefoot in my boat. I keep it really clean and even vacuum the carpet if it gets dirty.   Art
102217,solopaddler,2007-08-08 21:55:00,8605,"Sometimes I go barefoot, sometimes not depends. What I can't believe is how many people wear crocs. My gawd they gotta be the ugliest shoe, and fashion fad in general in the history of mankind! (I don't care how comfy they are, they're gross  )"
102230,mcallister.grant,2007-08-08 22:53:00,327,I always wear flip flops. I have gone barefoot before and sliced my foot really bad while walking in the water on zebra mussels. They are razor sharp.
