103163,Mike the Pike,2007-08-13 00:14:00,3421,Hi folks just got back from a week camping I had a great week until I flipped the 12 foot tinny.It happened real fast and next thing I knew I was in the water.I am OK I was wearing my PFD I was able to get the boat upright thanks to some kind folks.My digital camera is toast but I was able to retrieve my weeks pictures from the memory card so I should have a full report in the morning.I lost my net a red devil and a pair of rapala pliers.My sonar still works but the screen shows a light image my rapala digital scale is working.  Percher has given me some tips to try and start the motor which I will try tomorrow .The motor was upside down for about 15 minutes under water I managed to pull the kill switch before it went under .Should I worry about $$$$$$$$ or should it be easy to revive .Please let me know your experiences .After all this I am glad just to be alive .I will give all the details in my report.  Later Mike
103166,ccmtcanada,2007-08-13 00:30:00,7971,ACK!!!  Sorry to hear about the boat and motor!!  At least the pics weren't lost...cant replace those moments.  Looking forward to your report...including how you managed to flip your tinny.  Glad to hear you were ok though.

By no means am I a motor expert but the same thing happened to my brother so I'll give you what advice I can from witnessing that.  He towel/drip dried everything, put some oil in and replaced the spark plugs and got the motor running after an hour or so of fiddling with it and ran it for a couple of hours, but I remember him saying that if he didn't get it going really quick he'd have to disassemble the motor and dry everything out before it rusted.  If I were you, I'd call one of my mechanic buddies right away, and if they weren't around I'd start ripping the motor apart myself so I could dry things out.  Like I said, I'm not a mechanic...I really don't know much about motors., but it would seem sensible to me that it's a helluva lot easier to put a motor with non-rusted parts back together as opposed to the alternative.  I hope someone here has some more helpful advice for you.  edit: I really feel the need to stress that I don't know much about motors."
