But @ the end of the day, I pulled out 2 FULL! bags of garbage from around the ramp( I keep them in my boat for this).It really tick's me off that people have no respect for the land.There was a couple guys at the ramp, shocked that I did it.But maybe they will learn something from it.  One guy said the inmates from Maplehearst in Mlton, came out a while ago and did a clean up.Well at least that is a positive thing for them to do.   Sure beats making lic, plates. lol   Oh well, a slow day for the Berg, but at least I was part of the solution, rather part of the problem. And it does make me feel good.   Cya. Shawn."

I don't know why people think its ok to  throw away their garbage at or on the water  . Guess they weren't brought up very well with the environment in mind    . Too bad about your fish, but hey ya got some and yes if the water level drops anymore there will be none left  ."
102894,banger,2007-08-11 14:22:00,95,"I think your right about the water levels.If it drops even more there won't be any fish lsft in that lake.  I know it's been dry out, but HOLY dropping water levels batman. lol"
