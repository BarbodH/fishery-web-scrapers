102740,motion,2007-08-10 18:49:00,403,Hi guys. I am planning a trip out to Sparrow Lake tomorrow with my son. We have a boat and need to launch it preferably in the south end of the lake. Does anybody know a reasonable launch. (I have a 17.5ft boat ). I have used Lauderdales in the past but I find the $20.00 a bit steep.  Thanks in advance. Hope to post some pics when I get back.

102749,motion,2007-08-10 19:17:00,403,Thanks for the heads up. I have been caught like that before. Show up early and find the area full of boats looking to launch for a tourny. I may opt to try somewhere else. Lots of good lakes around.  What tournament is it?

102776,motion,2007-08-10 20:30:00,403,Just call Lauderdales and they tell me that the tournament is on Sunday. Looks like we are good to go tomorrow.

102916,misfish,2007-08-11 17:22:00,29133,"Well I just got back from prefishing the pool and the tourney is a week away and there were 20 or so boats there. Sparrow will have a few guys there today.  Oh,todays prefish was HOT.Now if I can get on them next weekend.LOL"
