103025,glen,2007-08-12 03:32:00,2641,Does anyone have any thoughts on christie lake?  Should i take my rod?  Thanks for any help.
103088,Rich,2007-08-12 15:41:00,3927,If you're talking about Christie Conservation Area it really sucks. They drain it every year so fish populations dont really get too high. The stocked trout ponds can be alright though.
103101,glen,2007-08-12 16:45:00,2641,Thanks Rich.  I guess you have to pay at the stocked ponds?
103183,Rich,2007-08-13 01:04:00,3927,Nope stock ponds are free provided you pay to get into the park obviously. They are stocked semi-regularly. The one closest to the lake was the one I always did best at.
103238,fatherof3,2007-08-13 03:56:00,1769,I was there a few weeks ago and most of the trout ponds had a lot of weed growth on them. Only got a couple of small fish shore fishing on the big lake.Was told trout ponds are only good earlier in the year
