102545,Abberz,2007-08-09 23:20:00,140,"Got away for the long weekend with a few close friends at Lake Weslemkoon.Fishing was great all weekend with 2-5+LB fish caught and plenty over the 3 pound mark. Plenty of action on senko's, 4-inch tubes and the big bass coming on the jig and pig.  Enjoy the pics.  Largemouth was 3.8, Smallie was 3.7   First 5 pounder of the weekend.   From left to right - 5.2/3.7/3.8/4.0   Big fish of the weekend 5.6lbs   Nice Sunset to end the weekend.   All fish were kept in the livewell for photo's and released shortly there after.    Here's a few more big bass from July off Buck Lake.  My boy Matt didn't even lose his cigarette bringing this 5lb largie in.   Same nite I dipped into a 5lber as well.   Hope you guys enjoyed the pics as much as we enjoyed reelin' them in."

102564,fatherof3,2007-08-10 00:06:00,1769,"say you did pretty good,great group of fish"
102565,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-10 00:06:00,0,Excellant report. I have been wanting to fish that lake for awhile. Apparently 6lbers are common and 8lbers swim in those waters but I heard over the years the place has recieved too much fishihng pressure and the fishing has died down abit. Aparrently not!!!!!
102574,fishindevil,2007-08-10 00:44:00,6254,"Great fishing guys !!!!!!! they are some huge buckets.  ..man you guys did a complete slaying of those hogs  ...wow i sure would like to get a few of those ,great pics as well cheers"
102585,steverowbotham,2007-08-10 01:41:00,1800,nice job dude.  big fish
102587,Abberz,2007-08-10 02:04:00,140,"Thanks guys. It was only my second time on the lake and apparently 7-8 pound fish are caught every year and plenty in the 5-6 pound range are quite common. Litterally every other bass was over 3 pounds last weekend. From what I know the bass fishing is and has been better than average on the lake for many many years.  As far as gamefish go, there are Largemouth and Smallmouth bass as well as Lake Trout found in the lake.....no pike or muskie which in my opinion makes the lake what it is. If a few of you guys do venture off and enjoy what Weslem has to offer please practice catch and release and if you do harvest any bass there is never any reason to keep anything over 2-2.5 lbs as the smaller fish are plentiful and better eating in my opinion.  Cheers"
102588,dustink,2007-08-10 02:08:00,526,Wow....great fish!!  dk
102616,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-10 10:50:00,0, Where is the launch and how far is it from Toronto? I might give it a try next year.

102621,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-10 10:58:00,2585,i had a buddy tell me the fishing is great up there still.  apparently your pics are the proof!  Nice report and those are some monster bass!!!  Cheers!
102673,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-10 13:14:00,115,"Buckets, buckets, buckets , and smallies, and no pike? hmmmm, i might have to ckeck that out!! Thanks for sharing, nice pics!!  ps, i agree with you on keeping the fish, if i want a feed i will keep the 1- 1.5 lb fish if they are plentiful  Are your arms sore? What kind of structure worked best? ie, deep(10 fow) weeds, timber, docks, slop (is there any)?Thanks for sharing!! John"
102686,Abberz,2007-08-10 13:45:00,140,"Johnny B - There is a Marina with a good launch, they charge $10 to take the boat in and out. I'm not sure as to how far it would be coming from TO, being a Kingston boy, but you take the 401 to the 62 exit in Belleville and go north, crossing 7 until you come to Weslemkoon Lake Rd. on your right. From the 401 its about an hours drive to get to the lake....25 mins of that would be travelling down Weslemkoon Lake Rd.  Bucketmouth - There isn't much slop as the water is tea coloured and it doesn't allow for a whole lot of weed growth, but timber, docks, dropoffs and what not worked best.  Hope this helps."
