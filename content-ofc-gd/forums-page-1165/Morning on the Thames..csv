One bass was around 2 lbs and the others were all smaller and a few were rock bass sized.  All were caught on a small orange jointed Rapala except the white bass which went for my Mepps Comet.                   "

103176,Beats,2007-08-13 00:48:00,543,"Should note as well that I was basically forced into writing an email to London city hall after fishing the spot that 6 of the eight fish were caught.  I counted no less than 30 syringe packages scattered under the bridge along with modified plastic bottles, condoms, dime bags and one actual needle.  Makes me think the other 29  or so unaccounted for syringes are on the bottom of the Thames.  Basically have to wear shoes with steel shanks and plastic gloves to go fishing there."
