102815,addict,2007-08-11 00:50:00,475,had the day off so went out to the rice.weather was hot fishing was tuff.went out in my boat with broken fishfinder and my trolling motor is cooked.so my fishing is limited to drifting or anchoring not the most productive way to fish but i managed a few.when the bite got slow i attempted to paddle and try to pitch and flip bullrushes.this was to tiring but i did get one on the jig and pig all other fish came on chase baits.cant wait to get a bow mount motor.here are a couple pics i was able to upload with my crappy computer.got about half a dozen of these guys   here are a few fish im stuck with for life

103045,Blake,2007-08-12 05:39:00,418,Great stuff.  Rice has been fishing tougher the last few years but when you find the sweet spots you can still do really well for bass and walleye.
