It was a lovely morning on the big water....    Rods were busy going 11 for 14 with a mixed bag of shakers and teens and the lines start humming immediately - even before we could get the metal on the riggers.  Not long before Iceguy got some nice action...    Fortunately, the fishing gods were happy with my jersey selection and showed some mercy on me as well...    In the name of hospitality, we invited a couple of shakers over for dinner.  Mine is about to walk the plank - cedar plank that is.    Overall, an awesome start to the weekend!  Thanks again Rob for your expertise and patience!!!  SS."
