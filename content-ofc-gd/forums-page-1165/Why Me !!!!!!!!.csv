102654,OhioFisherman,2007-08-10 12:39:00,6623,"LOL I have the kids little mermaid rods in the barn. No answers, I don`t fly fish and don`t fish for Salmon. Steelhead don`t seem hard to catch on bass tackle.  LOL wait till you spend 40 grand on a bass boat and can`t catch bass? Seen guys do it. 5k for a fish dinner seems pricey."
102655,Gerritt,2007-08-10 12:42:00,6129,  no no no I have the StrawBerry Shortcake rod.... Geez man get your fictional characters correct LOL   Gerritt.
102671,bowshep,2007-08-10 13:12:00,378,"Thats Better thanks gang. l Can't give up fissin'. Fishing again for me is something totaly different now. Its a pill that makes me so happy and calm. The people l fish with are the same way, it has become an obsetion in spiritual perportions. Dave, Jen, Sunny and Nancy all have it you see it in their eye's. More people should have this happyness in what ever gives them joy. This is why l always sign off with ""Peace Ken"" l got that from fishing"

102813,Kerry,2007-08-11 00:44:00,383,"Hey Ken, The secret is panfishin'.Catch a few perch, sunfish or  whatever then mercifully throw them back.That'll keep the fish gods happy.THEN get the big gear happening and hang on! Well......that's what I keep tellin' myself anyway. Seriously though that's why 10 % of fishermen catch 90 % of the fish.They've paid as much attention to the lake they fish and it's structure as they have to how they fish it.Which is why some guys on this board really are 'Fishing Gods' and the knowledge they pass on is worth taking in.  Keep the faith Ken it'll all come together when you least expect it. Kerry"

102833,fishindevil,2007-08-11 01:46:00,6254,"Hey....only give up when you die..  ....fishermen never give up....all you have to be is more stuborn than the fish...it works all the time...good-luck,comes to those that put in hard work...oh ya and those with the most money    cheers   oh ya and do all of your planning ,and back up plans as well and stick to them patience pays off...."
102852,GbayGiant,2007-08-11 03:26:00,1780,"Yes never give up. Try fishing with a pal in his home waters. If your using the same bait/technique as him right beside him while he/she's catching and your not then you can blame the fishing gods    but the right place/right time usually is the remedy, luck ? yes I believe in it a little, but dang it shouldn't hold you down for that long, god luck bud, you'll get the luck of the Irish back in no time even if your Italian."

102992,scuro,2007-08-12 00:25:00,386,"I had a moment like you had recently. $120 a day for a boat rental. Sure I caught fish but these are fish I could have caught from shore. The next day I went out with leadcore in a canoe and caught a laker. That was kinda of magical...so many things came into play but I kept it simple. People blow 10's of thousands of dollars on fishing...buying trucks...boats....motors. Changing their life even with cottage purchases.  Where am I going with this?  It's easy to get caught up in the gear and miss the core elements of fishing. Knowledge, being in touch with your environment, patience,....and luck. Luck changes.......recently I tried foul mouthing a lake, it produced for me to prove me wrong!!"
102424,Canuck2fan,2007-08-09 16:01:00,1444,"I can sort of relate on the expense part.... I stopped fishing for about 12 years, but got started back up 3 yrs ago. I used to fish for EVERYTHING with just 2 rods and 3 old clunky reels. Now I have 12 rods 9 of them specific to just one type of fishing About 15 reels.... 2 of the rods haven't seen the outside of the packaging but I just HAD to have them, because I know the ones I bought them to replace will eventually wear out or break. Then it was 3 different sets of waders. 3 complete sets of rain gear  the first for warm weather, the second for when it gets a bit more chilly and the last for the time of year when you can say if some asks wasn't it cold, YEP it was I haven't seen my nads in 3 days. Same with waterproof boots for shore fishing, nothing worse than cold or wet feet while fishing. Gloves I cheaped out there only spent about 150 bucks only to find out nothing is warmer than the 4.99 pairs of fleece ones from Walmart just carry 3 pairs for when one gets wet. If all 3 are wet I GO home.... Spent about 400 bucks on mono line alone just to find the perfect brand, for 50 bucks I will tell you what it is LOL. Braid bites HUGE so that was a total waste of well over a 100 right there playing with the 4 different brands of that crap I tried. Fluorocarbon is junk too I  don't even want to add up those receipts, I don't know how one person could get 5 bad spools of 4 different brands of the stuff but I did. NEVER will I fall for that hype again LOL. It is good old 4lb clear trilene XT from now on for clear days and green for muddy water.... Minnow buckets 3 diffent types, bait traps and nets 3 different kinds and sizes. Landing nets 2 so far but not done there I still need a BIG net that comes with a 3 section 12ft handle but haven't found one of those for sale yet.... Tackle couldn't even guess at as I seem to lose it as fast as my buddies can rig up with up with it.... Biggest expense though I don't even want to think about is the money in gas at 25 bucks a trip to either of the Great Lakes I fish at from where I live minimum of twice a week for 40+ weeks a year.... YIKES  On the other hand though I have had some great times fishing two or more times a week. For instance I fished for steel from September 2nd last year until June 12th this year, missing only 4 weeks when the whole lake shore was frozen. I got a chinook hen the first time out and I got a 5lb rainbow dropback the last time out. The longest I went during that time without catching chrome was 5 trips. The most important thing I learned when it comes to steelheading on Lake Huron is that, it is either you day or it isn't, no sense in letting it get to you, but you can't catch'em while sitting on the couch at home.  As for other types of fishing, I already have lost count of how many bass I nailed so far since it opened well over 100 and climbing though. Perch, had a few good days catching lots, more days when the bite was off, but I did have so much fun sitting on the pier in the warmer part of the year and just chatting with the other anglers.  So all in all I think I have gotten good value for my money....."
102426,Whopper,2007-08-09 16:08:00,2174,"bowshep my ""practice"" was a figure of speech. Like Lew said you can have all the mechanics down but if your not in the right spots it really doesn't matter where you can cast. Time on the or around the water is the best experience to figure out what the fish want not matter what your fishing for. I was in no way was trying to tell you you did not know how to cast a bait.  Like I said keep fishing they will come.  Good Luck  Whopper"
102429,bowshep,2007-08-09 16:20:00,378,"Ricoboxing l don't beleive in ""the Jinks"" it is eather poor prep. in the gear or just that it was not ment tobe. Trout pond never l spent to much time and energy finding places and practicing putting a row bag into a tea cup at 15'or to push a float above the roe bag so the drift happens so perfectly just to watch the Rainbows move out of its way. Most of all l will not quit fishing l love it so much and it is a life line for my soul. Peace Ken"
102434,bowshep,2007-08-09 16:27:00,378,Hello Whopper like Lew l was not taken aback to your comment you did not have all the info. l do read alot about fishing and put the tactics to use. lm just one of thoughs guys right now. But hey you dont have to catch to teach   Peace Ken
102436,Andy,2007-08-09 16:33:00,330,"I think you should take up fishing for musky. That would involve a whole new set of rods, reels, baits and possibly endless days of casting only to see a big fish follow your bait and turn away from your offering in contempt. Very relaxing. Andy"
102471,ADC,2007-08-09 18:53:00,82,"Well you know what they say.  ""The longer you wait, the better the bait""  If this holds true, get the mount ready for your trophy fish!  oh wait, I think that saying was for women, not fish."
102520,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-09 21:53:00,1183," Bang on!  It actually works both ways.  Right Ken....Right!!  hahaha   Geez, I thought you would have figured out that your skunk in the water landed you the best on land.   Men"
102525,DMASSE,2007-08-09 22:09:00,420,NICE FISH NANCY  WOW THAT GUY THAT GUIDED YOU THAT DAY MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE MONEY LOL  JUST REMEMBER KEEP IT UP AND ENJOYS FISHING KEN  REMEMBER ITS CALLED FISHING NOT CATCHING  (CATCHING IS A BONUS)  DAVE
102530,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-09 22:28:00,1183," It was YOU who guided me.  I believe it was on my third visit, maybe fourth to TO, that I met you on that cold spring morning for some fishing.  Ken was out of the truck for some reason, you turned, looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Ken is a good man"".  I did a silent gulp and knew that you meant it.  I am just a wee thing weighing slightly more than a rainbow and you convinced me no problem.      all kidding aside...looking forward to seeing you again Dave."
102533,Gerritt,2007-08-09 22:51:00,6129,"Is this a Dear Abby letter? I am hearing some serious whining and crying here.... Man up, dont worry about looking the part on the water and catch some fish! If your Dora The Explorer rod works?? then use it!    LOL  Gerritt."
102647,bowshep,2007-08-10 12:19:00,378,"l wish l had my Pocket Fisherman that cheap fold out cought me more fish than the gear l have now. Gerritt can l borrow you Barbie rod lol. Peace Ken. Ps sorry for the mushie stuff but its still about the me that most of you don't know and the fact that at least lm honest about it and the ""Whining and Crying"" part just more proof you don't know me"
102652,Jen,2007-08-10 12:34:00,833,OH Ken!  Still not catching fish?? How can that be?  Since I have fished with you I know your skill level... I assure you that it really has nothing to do with you...  Maybe you should do a fish dance or something?  Wishing you beat out your PB soon...  In my thoughts (thankful it isn't me) JK...  Always Jen
