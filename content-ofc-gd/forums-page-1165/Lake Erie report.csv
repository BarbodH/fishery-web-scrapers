The wind was Ok on the trip out but picked up for about 2 hours and then died right out later on just before a light shower rolled in. We were trolling by about 8:30am in about 55fow 30'-40' down.  Ended up out as far as 67fow. We started out with small spoons and ended up switching to larger ones after some slow action.  purple, orange and watermelon were the best producing colours.  We went 6 for 7 on walleye and 1 for 2 on rainbows.  The big bow we lost jumped about 15 times after it snapped the line trying to get the hook out. (kinda cool to see!)  Only got one sheephead and also about 6 silver bass.  All done by about noon.  Pair of 24"" walleye   jjcanoe"
