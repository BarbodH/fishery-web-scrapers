101657,Tacklebuster,2007-08-07 15:16:00,303,"Great report, finding those back woods lakes looks like a lot of fun."
101669,setomonkey,2007-08-07 15:49:00,872,"What a great report, good story and lots of pics. Back lake exploring is fascinating to me, esp. when it pays off with some good fishing."
101684,Sherriff,2007-08-07 16:23:00,252,Always a great read!  Love your reports!  Sherriff
101696,Aaron Shirley,2007-08-07 16:57:00,655,"Awesome report Mike!  Now that is my type of fishing.  Glad the back lake payed off for you guys.  Looks like a ton of fun.  Ya gotta love it when a plan comes together  Your report makes me want to fish a back lake now lol.  Cheers,  Aaron"
101769,Pigeontroller,2007-08-07 21:04:00,2793,Great report Mike!
101854,lew,2007-08-08 00:14:00,12767,"Thanks Mike, that was one of the best fishing / camping / hiking reports I've read this year.  Always good when a couple old buds can hook up for a trip like that."

101903,DebS,2007-08-08 00:52:00,56,"Fantastic report Mike, thanks for sharing! The pics were awesome. Glad your adventure turned out so well! DebS"
101904,solopaddler,2007-08-08 00:53:00,8605, We left Dundas at 11pm Wed. night which put us at Huntsville roughly 2am Thursday. So....my guess is not possible unless of course the lineups at Wonderland are so bad now a midnight departure to get a spot in line is required .
102007,turtle,2007-08-08 11:04:00,274,"Very nice back country exploring, well worth the work.  Also very nice saving the premium beer for dinner (Leffe) and having the bud and ex for the boat and portgaging."
102415,ccmtcanada,2007-08-09 15:24:00,7971,"WOW!!  What an awesome report.  The effort you went through to find that spot is amazing.  Great pics of the ""road""....LOL.  With effort like that, you certainly deserve the fish that you caught.  I'm always amazed at your outings....from steelhead river fishing, to big lakes, to remote lakes....you are a complete angler.  Oh yeah...it was great meeting you this morning...although it was brief.  Hope all went well with your test.  Thanks again very much for the trolling motor mounting bracket...all I need now is a trolling motor...LOL.  I'll definately take you up on your fall steelhead offer!!"
102443,solopaddler,2007-08-09 16:56:00,8605," Nice meeting you as well Cliff and I'm glad to see the bracket going to someone who'll use it! Hard to say how I did this morning....a lot of the questions were logic based and psychological in nature. I'm a completely illogical loon, so hopefully I pulled the wool over their eyes  . And now it's time for some much needed sleep...."
102454,PHISHY!,2007-08-09 17:31:00,24,That was an unbelievable report!!!  It really made my time pass at work!
102987,scuro,2007-08-11 23:52:00,386,"Backwoods with Leffe....how backwoods is that? Awesome beer, excellent report, sounds like the type of trip I have been chastised for (but honey if I can't see a way through the jungle I won't cross it )   Looking more closely at this pic....  Is that Dan ""excited catching so many fish"" or is that Dan after a few? (notice the empties at the front of the boat)?"
103028,Golfisher,2007-08-12 03:44:00,586,"Fascinating story, superbly told!  Thanks a bunch!"
101402,tbayboy,2007-08-06 22:36:00,1497,Great report.  I love the whole idea of exploring unknown places for fish.  Glad to see you made it there and back
101412,mattyk,2007-08-06 23:01:00,2110,"amazing report, looks like a lot of fun!"
101420,fatherof3,2007-08-06 23:11:00,1769,"wow,great report and looks like you had a blast"
101426,FinS,2007-08-06 23:20:00,463,awesome report Mike i havent been on here for awhile no time to fish too busy with the kids  the lake where you ventured out to looks very familiar u should have brought some big herring with you i am happy you didnt drive all the way down with the crv ive got stuck there about 10 years ago with a little ford ranger mind you the road was alot better 10 years ago it wasnt fun either and i remember that old garbage scow boat lol i cant believe its still there wtg keep em coming hopefully ill beable to get out for some river steel this fall
101433,solopaddler,2007-08-06 23:32:00,8605," Hey Rene, I figured if you saw this report you'd recognize the spot  , that's cool. Not surprised that boat's been there awhile...it looked ancient. As fas the herring thing goes, funny you mentioned that, but another local friend of mine who ice fishes that lake said the same thing. Maybe locals do know a thing or two  . I know he landed a 47"" pike through the ice there a couple winters back. Stay in touch,  cheers,  Mike"
101456,fishindevil,2007-08-07 00:59:00,6254,"AMAZING !!!!!!   thats what i call a backwoods fishing/camping trip....and well your hard work sure did pay off....man you guys did a number on those fish,they prob have never even seen a lure before...  ..thats a very good secret spot you guys found...and im sure you will be back to fish some more....thanks for sharing   cheers"
101492,Musky or Specks,2007-08-07 01:38:00,2710,Absolutely awesome report. New water is always such a thrill. One thing I find handy doing old logging roads/snowmobile trails with a 4x4 is one of those portable hunting saws. They are great for sawing threw logs that cant be thrown off the trail.
101493,Smokey,2007-08-07 01:39:00,1278,Very nice Mike. Always great to see one of your reports. Thanks
101534,dustink,2007-08-07 03:32:00,526,"WOW.  Talk about getting a guy all geeked up....less than 3 weeks until I spend 5 days up at Fushimi Lake PP, and now there's no way I'm going to sleep tonight.  What an amazing trip!  Thanks for sharing!  dk"
101543,camillj,2007-08-07 04:15:00,1988,"As always, great report Mike, thanks for sharing !"

101589,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-07 11:44:00,2585,very very impressive report!  i loved the back lake adventure.  thanks for sharing!  Cheers!
101591,Roy,2007-08-07 11:54:00,13728,"Such a great report Mike. The work getting up there sure seems trivial once you get up there. You both have some beauty fish. Y'know, lotsa folks would pay large to have a table such as yours in their living room."
101605,1leggedangler,2007-08-07 13:00:00,364,"Great back lakes report. Looked like two good buddies having a great time to say the least. Nice Pics!  Cheers, 1leg"
101609,Moosebunk,2007-08-07 13:18:00,3970," Mike, ya got your own little piece of paradise up there man.  Get's me aching to sit in that big steel tub catch some pike, then hoof it back to the cabin for pops and eyes. lol.  Next time your up that road take some wood and make a wee bridge.  Super report."
101612,Tomcat,2007-08-07 13:19:00,395,A great read with great pics. Thanks for sharing.
101618,TJQ,2007-08-07 13:48:00,7806,Now thats a report!!!!  Awesome!
101625,mcallister.grant,2007-08-07 14:07:00,327,"Hey Mike,  Awesome report. Thanks for taking the time to be so in depth and posting some amazing pics. It's really appreciated!!"
101639,solopaddler,2007-08-07 14:34:00,8605," You're welcome anytime 'bunk (I'll see what I can do about the bridge  ).  And thanks to everyone for the kind remarks!  (on a side note, Dan read my report. He's not a member here, but insisted I log on and tell everyone he's not really ""lazy by nature"". So okay, YOU'RE NOT LAZY. Happy now?  )"
