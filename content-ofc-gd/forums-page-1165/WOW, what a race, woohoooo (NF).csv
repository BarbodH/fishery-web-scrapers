103142,Joey,2007-08-12 21:42:00,9122,Now that was an exciting race and finish.  And fisticuffs to boot in a Nascar race.  Love it.  Joey
103196,bucktail,2007-08-13 01:29:00,1857,Missed it but my buddy is down there and will be baclk to work on Tuesday so it should be a good story.
103203,danc,2007-08-13 01:37:00,4677,Man. Jeff's spin cost Sis and I $650.00. She had Jeff to win for $600.00 and Jimmie finishing 5th would have paid $50.00. Oh well. There's always next week....
103211,Joey,2007-08-13 01:49:00,9122,"Oh, that really bites Dan.  I had resigned myself to the fact that Gordon was going to win and Tony come in second, then whoopsie, the spinout.  I was jumping up and down.  Paul was in the other room asking what was wrong with me  Better luck next week you two  Joey"
103225,danc,2007-08-13 02:06:00,4677,"Thanks Joey. I was really pulling for Sis today. She hasn't won a nickel in this pool in over a year now. First place normally pays $300.00 but 6 cars are left unpicked and are treated as carryovers. Since nobody won last weekend, first place was worth double.  It was heartbreaking to see Jeff spin out with 2 to go. But that's racing. Smoke drove a heck of a race and deserved the win. We're getting close to the chase now. Jr.'s in trouble. I'll be watching the Kansas chase race from the best seats in the house once again this year. I might even take a photo or two while I'm there.  "
