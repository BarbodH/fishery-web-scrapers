I know of a dam on the ottawa river just north of Mattawa. Anyone fished it?.. I will have a small 8ft flat bottom with a 4 hp motor, so I gotta keep outta the fast current and big water.. Any Suggestions would be a big help Thanks in adavance Chromer"

Beautiful spot...watch out for large submerged bolders. It's not deep at all although there are a few pockets that I could see from shore. Caught nothing but a few bass there on that one night.
