102770,fatherof3,2007-08-10 20:21:00,1769,My ankle is starting to feel better so I took my 6 year old son walking on the nith in some new areas.We both had a lot of hits and I managed a couple of small bass. My son lost a bass right in front of him and managed to land this guy.He refuses to hold them.The conservation web site says the nith gets runs of trout in the fall and can see why.There was some really nice waters in this new section we tried.Here are a few scenery shots.Never realized how great it is around here until starting to fish again.All these pictures were within a 10 minute walk of my house.Hope you enjoy
