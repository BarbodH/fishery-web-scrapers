103037,fishersquige,2007-08-12 04:51:00,52,Promised Land Fishing Camp is a class act operation.  The cottages are very clean and they also have a nice little beach front for the kids.  Claire and Frank are great hosts they treated us like their sons.  As for the fishing Frank will put you on the fish.  http://www.promisedlandcamp.net
