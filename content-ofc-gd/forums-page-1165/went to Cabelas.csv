101706,ricoboxing,2007-08-07 17:29:00,398,"went to michigan on the weekend so took a trip to cabelas.   if you guys ever get the chance to go, you gotta check it out. its twice the size of bass proshops in toronto. not that many great deals, but worth going just to see the store. all i bought was two muskie bucktails. total damage done = $12  not bad!"
101708,lazybum,2007-08-07 17:40:00,142,"Very nice store. I was also there with MJL on Saturday between 1:00pm and 3:00pm. Family went for three days of power shopping in Troy, Auburn Hills and Birch Run.  Stayed in Troy near Somerset Mall.  Too far to go more than once a year."
101794,MJL,2007-08-07 22:33:00,2427,"I also had fun at Cabelas.  The store layout with the fish tanks and ponds + all the stuffed animal exhibits was impressive.  I couldn't believe the sizes of some of the trout they had swimming around (bows and brookies).  To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the amount of fishing inventory they had in stock but in all fairness, I was looking for some very specialized items that were not bass/walleye/musky related.  What surprised me was the fact that PowerPro in the US retails for much cheaper than in Canada.  I bought a couple of 300 yard spools of PowerPro for $25 each.  In Canada, 150 yards retails at most local tackle shops for almost the same amount after tax...Go figure.  Also didn't see too many deals or items priced below what I normally pay back at home.  I also brought my camera with me but unfortunately it died after taking 2 pics of the fish tank...There's always next year"
101836,OhioFisherman,2007-08-07 23:38:00,6623,Great store(Dundee)! LOL one is coming to my area! Yahoo! Now that fishing and walking is limited?
101839,fishindevil,2007-08-07 23:48:00,6254,"Man-oh-man.  ....i would be just like a kid in a candy store,i think thats about as close to heaven without exactly being there...lol..lol..lol and like their catalouges i get all the time say,THEY HAVE EVERYTHING....cheers"
101849,danc,2007-08-08 00:05:00,4677,I visit the Kansas store and one of the Minnesota stores (there's 3 there now) annually. They could charge ten bucks admission to their stores and they'd still be packed.
101858,misfish,2007-08-08 00:18:00,29133,"Ok I want to know how long it would take to get there from here,Barrie? Im thinking a road trip for me and the mrs,s. A get away weekend."
101870,OhioFisherman,2007-08-08 00:28:00,6623,"http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.ad...amp;2z=&r=f  Brian, Dundee is a long way for you."
101878,danc,2007-08-08 00:31:00,4677," Yeah Brian. Kansas might be closer. And while you're there, you might want to take in a race, which is right next door to Cabelas. Sept. 30."
101879,MJL,2007-08-08 00:32:00,2427, Tag on another few minutes for tolls and border crossings...It's especially bad on long weekends.
101912,Fisherman,2007-08-08 01:08:00,7201,"We did it in about 5 hours, leave very early in the morning, about 0200, drive X crountry, Barrie, Anus, Alliston,Guelph, London, cross at Windsor, trhu Detroit, back home late that night.  Should have stayed another day, maybe next time or wait and see if the store in Montreal is going to be built."
101946,Dano,2007-08-08 02:23:00,719,"I've yet to go, though I plan too at some point. Looks like fun, thanks rb."
102932,bigcreekdad,2007-08-11 18:51:00,546,"I work part time there in the fly fishing dept.  It's like working in a big toy store. Plus you get to talk fishing all day long, get great discounts, see all the new gear, and actually get paid ( not much) for it. The perfect retirement job!! If anyone makes it down.....look me up and say Hi......I'm John in Fly Fishing."
102935,Bear,2007-08-11 19:44:00,106,"there was rumors there was one going to be built near Montreal, this was about a year ago  Anyone heard anything else Bear"
102977,bassassin,2007-08-11 22:57:00,152,I called Cabelas in the U.S and spoke to a rep there. Apparently 2009 there will be a Cabelas up and running in Montreal!!!!!
103018,Bob Devine,2007-08-12 03:12:00,251,"Brian, it takes me 3hrs and 15 min to get to BPS TO from Windsor. That is doing 120 and down the 407. Once you cross the border it will take about another 55 min.  I have made the trip many times. Other great fishing stores are BPS and Gander Mtn."
103227,Guest mistyriver1,2007-08-13 02:15:00,0,Glad to see you made it there RB.  I remember you sending me a PM back in the spring when I put my post up on it.     Great store !!
103278,misfish,2007-08-13 10:06:00,29133," Thanks guys  I been to Gander (once) I found everything all over the place.Confusing,but lots of product.  With the way the dollar is right now,it,s worth the drive Im thinking.  Leave here at 5 am get there 11 am or so."
