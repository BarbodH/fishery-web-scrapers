100900,mepps,2007-08-04 02:52:00,1301,"I never get tired of seeing those pics - the shot of the fish with the smaller pike in the mouth is from a different type of camera - could be the same fish i guess, but I remember ssing it it long before teh pics of the monster pike came out"
100909,bigfish1965,2007-08-04 03:39:00,3382,It was caught in Europe. Or was it at Lakair? I think that was one fo the fish I caught to win the Crayola Tourney.
103002,stuntman,2007-08-12 02:04:00,96,Some lodge in upper Ontario put their name on the pic and uses it for advertising.  Wish I could find that pick and out those dishonest ****insert your own words here****  Stuntman
103008,canadianguy33,2007-08-12 02:16:00,121,"Wow!  Unlike nearly everyone else, I've never seen that pic before.  Thanks for posting it."
103015,bucktail,2007-08-12 02:53:00,1857,Enough of this picture!
100708,Jay T,2007-08-03 18:33:00,282,"Don't know who this is but just got it in an e-mail. Thought I might share the pics. What a monster pike. Supposed it attacked a 36"" pike that the guy had on, and would not let go of it. He did not hook the monster pike. It weighed in at 55lbs.  "
100709,Jay T,2007-08-03 18:33:00,282,Here is the other pic. 
100710,ilario,2007-08-03 18:34:00,166,that's been circulating for a year or two now...  i think it's from europe

100712,Motorhead,2007-08-03 18:37:00,163,I think those pics have been around here before but that is still one HUGE fish.... I bet you kayak guys would have fun bringing that one in ....  Doug
100713,addy79,2007-08-03 18:40:00,573,nahh not again!!
100714,Jay T,2007-08-03 18:42:00,282,Sorry guy's first time I have seen it. Just thought I might share.
100720,Stoty,2007-08-03 19:06:00,2910,"That picture of the ""bite"" look pretty photoshoped to me.  All the rippples in the water are identical.... and around end of the mouth of the big fish just doesnt look right.  I think someone is using photoshop to play with our minds!"
100721,ADC,2007-08-03 19:07:00,82,Well I havent seen it before ....  what else can you say other than THAT PIKE IS HUGE
100723,addy79,2007-08-03 19:22:00,573,YOUR HUGE T!!!!!!
100725,danbouck,2007-08-03 19:26:00,4380,
100731,fishinggeek,2007-08-03 19:39:00,325,"Actually that pike was caught on Toronto Island 4 years ago.  It was fairly far out by the ferry dock, but I saw him bring it in and take those pictures.  Huge!"
100750,ilario,2007-08-03 20:12:00,166,"  U sure about that?? I've heard otherwise... Also, that doesn't look like the T.O. ferry docks or anything around the islands..and I know that areas really well  I heard it was either Poland or france, or soemthing like that   I think the world record pike came out of french waters... monde dieu"
100753,danbouck,2007-08-03 20:16:00,4380,Ontario record is 42.12 pounds. Seems a bit bigger than that.  Is was caught in Europe.
100755,rickster,2007-08-03 20:17:00,495,wish I could find a pic of someone beating a dead horse  
100758,douG,2007-08-03 20:22:00,2693,  Just asque.
100761,rickster,2007-08-03 20:23:00,495,L.O.L Thanks man
100765,Motorhead,2007-08-03 20:25:00,163,  here ya go....    The stick man should be beating the horse but because I` m computer illiterate it`s not working as a gif. ???  I tried any ideas???    Doug
100768,ADC,2007-08-03 20:27:00,82,  whats that mean?  Did I offend you or something?  I havent seen that pic before and was happy to see it.  Not sure how that qualifies me for a cheap shot?
100769,danbouck,2007-08-03 20:28:00,4380,Does this work  
100771,rickster,2007-08-03 20:30:00,495,LOL   ok enough already sorry I asked
100782,Joey,2007-08-03 20:51:00,9122,"Its funny, I have seen that pike pic (I believe it is from Norway) on the net so many times, then last weekend when we went into the tackle shop in Bronte, it was tacked to the wall with all the other local pics of people holding fish.  Paul and I had a good chuckle.  Joey"
100794,Moosebunk,2007-08-03 21:37:00,3970,"You can see a number of pictures of pike that size, along with the name of this angler and more pictures of that fish in the past winter issue of Esox Angler.  And yeah, it was caught in Holland.  I've heard it's from Rainy Lake... LOTW... Winnipeg area... and now even Toronto Harbour.  Pfffft.   My nieghbour just down the street even tried to pass it off as one of his ""cousins friends"" fish.  It grows tiresome, but  I guess we should all get used to it, cause with internet the next big catch from anywhere across the globe might as well be the biggun from your local pond."
100801,Stoty,2007-08-03 22:08:00,2910,"You're all wrong,  I caught it in March at the Toronto Fishing show, in the trout tank, blindfolded, with a shoelace and safety pin."
100847,fishindevil,2007-08-03 23:54:00,6254,"Yes its a huge pike for sure.  ...too bad it wasnt me who caught that huge monster....its a fish of a lifetime,and it has been around for about 3 yrs or so,it pops up here every so often.....but it is a great pic for sure...cheers"
