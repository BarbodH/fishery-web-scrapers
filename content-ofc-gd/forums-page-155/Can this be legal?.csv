937663,Moosebunk,2015-10-01 22:31:00,3970,Shooting from a moving boat.  That's everyday play in James Bay.
937227,Mister G,2015-09-29 22:39:00,1429,"Shooting towards houses...  Mind numbingly idiotic Not really depending on the distance.  Most non-hunters have no idea of the distance bird shot will travel or better yet effective on killing ""ducks"" in this case. Forty yards is the MOST for killing waterfowl with today's steel shot and that's still a lucky shot by most accounts.  As a waterfowl hunter I was taught many moons ago to put one decoy out about 40 yards out from my duck blind to gauge the max killing range and don't shoot at anything beyond that range because you will only cripple ducks and mostly you will be wasting expensive ammo.  Now when a duck is flying in the swamp the best gauge you have is the trees. If they are above the tree line they are too high to kill.  Now you know the killing range of a shotgun using bird shot. Not nearly as far as you probably thought. So when you see a boat way off shore shooting towards shore, in most cases they are well beyond reaching shore with their shots. And even if their shot does reach you it's like heavy rain coming down on you as I have experienced this many times hunting swamps during duck season."

937255,John Bacon,2015-09-30 00:03:00,3277,"Killing range is one factor; the range at which it can take a person's eye out would be another.  In the case in the initial report; they were shooting at sitting ducks so any shot would be coming in on level trajectory, not raining down on them."

Migratory birds such as woodcock can be hunted with lead even though you need a migratory bird permit to hunt them. And you are correct that there are many uses for full choked barrels, even extra full chokes (turkey).

I have seen guys on cooks bay chasing flocks of birds around in a pontoon boat at WOT with 2 guys up front blasting away…. The legalities of shooting from a boat have been mentioned already in this thread.  And I think have shaken out enough to give you an idea of the law.  I have a 14’ aluminum with a 9.9 fully equipped with a duck blind.  I only shoot from this rig once the boat it still, and the motor is up and out of the water, 99% of the time I’m moored in to a spot nestled in the shadow grass….  Based on my interpretation of the law, this is perfectly legal. What these clowns did to you was very far from legal, and IMO they should themselves be shot (non-fatally) and pissed on.  They give law abiding water fowlers a bad name.  How I interpret the law, they broke several laws. I need to stop now.  These people drive me absolutely nuts.  I am so angry about this post, I just need to stop…."

Shooting towards shore could be considered careless use of a firearm. Thats serious stuff.  Shooting from a moving boat is illegal, unless they were chasing a crippled bird. Even still, if it was a cripple, they should have got between the bird and shore, and fired away from shore.  If they did indeed run up to the ducks and shoot them while still moving, they have broken a few regulations. Its illegal to have a firearm out of its case and loaded in a moving boat. Its illegal to chase waterfowl, and its illegal to harrass waterfowl.  Cliff, pm me a description of their boat and motor. I'd love to see these tools out there. I have no problem letting them know what their doing is not right.  This time of year brings out all the once a year duck hunters, and they just want to shoot their guns.

We'd only been there a short time when a guy pulls up to us in a camouflaged boat and told us we had to leave the area RIGHT NOW because he wanted to back up against the rushes and shoot the ducks that came in and they'd be scared off with us being there.  He didn't ask if we'd do him the favor by leaving, but rather ordered us out of ""his"" spot.  I told him if he'd have asked us we'd have gladly moved on but because he ordered us out we now had no intention of leaving and continued to cast even though we'd already covered the bay.

936940,dave524,2015-09-28 17:16:00,4508,"Backwards, waterfowl are Federal and moose is Provincial. Shooting from a boat under power is definitely illegal. Some of what you saw was illegal, all of it unethical. As a teen I thought shooting sitting partridge was unethical living in Niagara, then dad bought a cottage up north, attitudes changed."

936943,Fang,2015-09-28 17:19:00,1330,"don't know if you can actually ever see this printed in a formal regulation but this is how I and all my duck hunting buddies were taught and have since practiced  From FAQ published by Government Canada site on Migratory Bird Hunting Question: While hunting from a boat, may I start shooting at waterfowl as soon as the engine has been turned off? Answer: No. Hunting may only commence once the motor has been turned off and the boat (any boat, canoe or yacht equipped with a motor) has stopped its forward progress.  The only exception I ever ran across is there is a moderate allowance if you are drifting a river where the water speed is carrying you along."
936944,Fisherman,2015-09-28 17:19:00,7201,"Yes you can legally shoot migratory birds from a motorboat. http://Question: While hunting from a boat, may I start shooting at waterfowl as soon as the engine has been turned off? Answer: No. Hunting may only commence once the motor has been turned off and the boat (any boat, canoe or yacht equipped with a motor) has stopped its forward progress.  Ah Fang beat me by a keystroke."
936946,Fang,2015-09-28 17:22:00,1330,"As a follow up, MNR officer I heard discussing this at a hunting show said if your anchor is down then I'll be 100% sure your forward momentum is stopped"
936947,Rod Caster,2015-09-28 17:24:00,5784,"I thought ducks/migratory birds had to be in flight, not on the water surface, in order to fire. Seems dangerous to be shooting flat instead of in the air as well. Shot falling out of the air is harmless, but shot moving laterally, yikes.  Please correct me if I'm wrong (I've never actually duck hunted)."
936949,FloatnFly,2015-09-28 17:30:00,1640,"i would think its illegal to shoot at birds on the water, not in flight, simply because bullets will deflect off the waters surface, also pretty sure you can;t shoot towards houses"
936950,porkpie,2015-09-28 17:34:00,2521,"No law against shooting ducks on the water, but it's not very sporting.  You can't shoot from a moving boat if it has a motor.  Engine stopped, all forward motion ceased.  You must however make all attempts reasonable to recovered a wounded bird, and under those circumstances only you can give chase in order to finish a cripple.  You can most certainly use manual power to scull or sneak on ducks with a paddle driven craft, and you can also use the current in a river to drift downstream and still legally harvest birds."
936951,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-28 17:39:00,8243,"I'm going back 30 years ago when we had a camp on the Ottawa. I didn't hunt but the guys would shoot waterfowl and I was told NO you can't shoot a sitting duck. It must of changed if it's legal now, I would be mad as hell to Cliff especially for these lugins shooting at shore, that's just stupid. A well placed throw of a stone in the middle of the flock would piss them off I bet, or a blast from a safety horn. Idiotos."

936954,mike rousseau,2015-09-28 17:49:00,4661,Yup
936957,Big Cliff,2015-09-28 18:22:00,6899,"Well, I guess my shooting at ducks from shore would be illegale too then would it? Especially if the ducks are between me and a boat that was shooting at them! (no, I wouldn't do it) but it sure makes me mad that these idiots feel the need to kill something so badly that they will run around in boats blasting at ducks on the water with 12 gauges.  These are the idiots that give ""sportsmen"" a bad name."
936958,Dara,2015-09-28 18:24:00,3052,"You can't shoot from a motor boat unless its stopped and the motor is covered. We always motored out to where we were going to hunt, then tied up and covered the motor with the bag we had our decoys in. Then you're legal  I see no issue about shooting towards shore. You are shooting a shotgun with pellets, not a bullet  Chasing ducks with a motorboat and shooting them on the wing would be really fun, but its really illegal too"
936961,AKRISONER,2015-09-28 18:36:00,5558,"not gonna lie, but after fishing pigeon this weekend, the whole duck/goose hunt is friggin cringe worthy.  Gotta love having shotguns shot directly over your head while fishing all day.  i understand its everyone's resources, they could argue that I shouldn't be there fishing, but all its going to take is one slip and someones kid is going to get hurt. At least me casting isnt going to kill anyone."

936963,Brettiop,2015-09-28 18:53:00,279,Please quote where it says the motor has to be covered. Wondering that as well...  That sounds wrong.
936968,wallyboss,2015-09-28 19:31:00,1095,If their shotguns were loaded while travelling with the boat (that is illegal) If the boat was stopped by the time they shot ( That's legal) Shooting at the water with a shotgun is legal. With a rifle it is not legal. Shooting a duck that is floating on the water is legal ( maybe not moral) But shooting towards shore where there is houses is plain stupid.
936969,jimmer,2015-09-28 19:34:00,2730,"Idiots. My son (2 years old at the time) and I almost got shot by a hunter that did this. He just waited until we were out of sight, but the pellets still blasted through the trees and almost hit us. I went running down there and the guy just took off without saying anything. I called the cops, but they said there wasn't much they could do once he was gone. He was shooting at one green wing teal. It was a battle field out on Pigeon with all the hunters and anglers out there at the same time."
936972,tb4me,2015-09-28 19:52:00,3295,"I cant help but laugh when out on the Trent river..If the guys bird hunting would sit and wait they would get some birds..It sounds like a darn war going on out there..Never seen them carry any birds in either..Cracks me up cause all that gun fire and no birds..what are they doing out there anyway? My neighbor Simon duck hunts from his john boat it has a nice blind-cover.. He never shoots from a moving boat never travels with a loaded firearm in the boat.. always trims the motor all the way up, then deploys the duck blind before pulling out a gun. He is a respectful hunter and always comes back with the grub..You should have seen the look on my wife's face when he let my then 12 year old daughter hold his 12 gauge (unloaded of course) that made mama happy...lol"
