936454,BillM,2015-09-25 13:42:00,17367,"Yeah, the more and more I look the more I realize it's a black crappie.  It's bigger then most bass I catch"
936458,PUMP KNOWS,2015-09-25 13:54:00,937,If you guys caught one that big...would you keep or release it?
936461,BillM,2015-09-25 13:57:00,17367,"Release it, what's the point of keeping it?  All the big crappies are females.  Gotta let them reproduce."
936462,Brettiop,2015-09-25 14:00:00,279,"If you guys caught one that big...would you keep or release it?  Ide take a ton of pics and release it, but it would be getting replicated for sure..."
936497,manitoubass2,2015-09-25 16:04:00,11391,"Yep same here?  Billm, yes, this black crappie must have been confused and though it was a largemouth?  I can hardly believe a crappie got that big!  My pb is 14.25"" and I never weighed it but id guessunder 1.5lbs???"
936499,BillM,2015-09-25 16:07:00,17367,"We get some nice ones down here, but this on on a whole different level."
937394,CRAPPIE,2015-09-30 15:48:00,213,"Hi Manitoubass 2,  Did you or friend actually caught this crappie? Was it in Canada and when was it?  Thanks!"
937396,misfish,2015-09-30 15:53:00,29133,I think I know a couple of lakes that hold some monsters.  Late fall will tell.
937402,manitoubass2,2015-09-30 15:59:00,11391, It was posted on facebook by an angler in the US  I got it from ron lidner and he said they were trying to track down the angler(whatever that means)
936200,manitoubass2,2015-09-24 04:31:00,11391,"19.25"" 4.25lb(alleged) black crappie  "
936206,Fisherman,2015-09-24 10:28:00,7201,"Jeez, now that's a slab!"
936207,Gallie,2015-09-24 10:51:00,1215,"Wow, and i thought my 1 lbers were big lol."

936210,OhioFisherman,2015-09-24 11:06:00,6623,"Big slab, the weight seems about right for a healthy one that length."
936219,Moosebunk,2015-09-24 12:23:00,3970,Ate a bass.  Geesh!  That's a catch.
936222,BillM,2015-09-24 12:41:00,17367,"That looks like a white crappie to me, which get way bigger then the black crappie we get up here.  Imagine pulling that thing in? lol!"
936223,netminder,2015-09-24 12:41:00,514,Shenanigans!  That's as big as my biggest bass this year!
936229,Roy,2015-09-24 13:12:00,13728,"I wonder if that's the same fish that Spiel posted in ""Fishing News"" March 29, 2010."
936230,Thrilla,2015-09-24 13:18:00,164,"Def a black crappie, def a good one"
936234,NAW,2015-09-24 14:09:00,4022,Oh my!!  That's a hog!!!
936241,lowerunit,2015-09-24 14:46:00,53,WOW  awesome fish.I wanna get me some crappie.
936248,manitoubass2,2015-09-24 15:11:00,11391,"Never seen that pic roy, maybe?  I seen this posted by ron lidner last night on facecrack"
936314,adolson,2015-09-24 19:19:00,783,"I wonder if that's the same fish that Spiel posted in ""Fishing News"" March 29, 2010. Don't think so. Here's a pic of the guy that Spiel posted:  http://www.swankboys.com/2010/05/did-you-hear-about-4-12-pound-crappie_16.html"
936323,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-24 20:14:00,627,That last one has been thrown at the camera....LOL  First one looks legit though. Cameras are funny things when you mess with perspective.
936324,misfish,2015-09-24 20:15:00,29133,Way to stay on top of things Dara    I mean Dana.  Both HUGE slabters
936329,Locnar,2015-09-24 20:42:00,645,Cheese n Crepes that's huge!
936347,manitoubass2,2015-09-24 21:29:00,11391,"Even with the hero pose in the second picture, the first one looks bigger"
936402,lowerunit,2015-09-25 02:33:00,53,Was it caught in Ontario?
936413,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-25 03:41:00,8243,I love what you can do with Photoshop.
936419,manitoubass2,2015-09-25 07:25:00,11391,Ill look to see if I can find the post.  Im pretty sure it said stateside
936420,manitoubass2,2015-09-25 07:27:00,11391,"Thats one heck of a photoshop job. Not saying it isnt possible but if thats the case someone took alot of time. Just look at the tail alone  A photoshopped pic usually gives up a clue or two, I see none in this pic"
936426,Mister G,2015-09-25 11:09:00,1429,I am guessing a black crappie.
936441,BillM,2015-09-25 13:10:00,17367,"If that's a black crappie, I'll eat my hat!  I can't get over how big that thing is, lol!!"
936446,Brettiop,2015-09-25 13:30:00,279,"That's certainly a black, better start marinating that hat bill!  Its .75 lbs short of a world record if its truly 4.25 pounds...true monster"
