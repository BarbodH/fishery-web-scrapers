Then don't.  It shouldn't matter to you if someone else wants to, so long as they meet the legal requirements and are otherwise law abiding.

That said it is not a matter of being afraid to go out it is a matter of common sense that keeps me from carrying.

You stop and look around a blind corner before pulling out into an intersection. This thought of what if he has a gun has the power to stop someone from becoming causally stupid. Up North you have a luxury that we will never have the very low percentage of legally owned handguns. If someone is in your house the odds of it being a gun fight is rare it is usually you with your trusty hand bludgeon or the horror a knife. That is not the scenario down here it is most likely and needs to be thought of as a life or death situation where as I have said first one to shoot wins. This is not a casual act and has life changing repercussions you don't hesitate in this nor any other time you bring maximum violence to end the conflict with a minimum amount of damage to yourself. This is a strange thing to most unless you have had either military training or other tactical schooling but it is the way I was taught and it has served me well over the years.

What I will say, then I'll bow out, is that if I lived south of the border I would carry and conceal a handgun, legal or not. Living where we do I have no need to. I don't go to neighbourhoods here in Ontario where it would be prudent to have a weapon such as many neighbourhoods in Toronto and Hamilton. I know where not to be so I don't go there. I guess it is my right to go to any neighbourhood I wish but the reality is that there are places here I have no business to be.  Just like here I don't drive around certain neighbourhoods in Gary Indiana, Miami, Detroit, Youngstown Pa. or Niagara Falls NY.

There is nothing more devastating than finding you brought a knife to a gun fight. I am tactically trained as well as ex-special forces. I don't think like you do I am the one who will be the first one to apologize and try to walk away from a fight. I will also be the one who when cornered and yes it has happened release maximum force to put down anyone who threatens me. I have not pulled a gun in public however I have used force to neutralize an opponent when they pressed the issue. fighting or pulling a gun is not something that is pleasant far from it. The mindset has to be maximum force to keep minimum damage to ones self at all times. Arm me with a baseball bat and it will have the same outcome I don't hit you in the leg and you will not get back up off the ground. Violence is the last resort I would rather give you the shirt off my back if you are cold. As far as outlawing handguns it just isn't possible down here they are everywhere and the only ones who would turn them in is the law abiding citizens surely you do not thing that the criminals would become disarmed in the same numbers that lawful citizens would be. For Canada my advise is never open Pandoras box keep handguns outlawed allow people to keep all of the guns that can be used for sporting and hunting applications. Having protection that matches the level that a criminial has is just plain good sense. When you go off into the bush you carry the items that you think you need to go there have fun and make it back without damage to oneself. You take the tools available to get the job done easily as well as a mindset and skills to be safe. As I said before I am not trying to change your mind nor justify what we do down South just point out we will never see this eye to eye.  Art"

937260,spincast,2015-09-30 00:18:00,3279," That is an incredibly insightful post.   I wish more people understood this.  More and more, America is becoming split down the middle ... morally, politically, culturally, behaviorally ...... and interestingly, the boundary of that split is often urban vs. rural.  Lastly, it's also interesting that the large majority of American gun-toting, flag-waving, ammo-hoarding, second amendment cowboys (and yes, they certainly do exist, in large numbers) live in areas with low gun-related crime rates.   really? Curious where that stat came from? This one has some interesting numbers based on the urban rural comparison... http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/  ""Age-adjusted rates per 100,000 U.S. standard population. Rates for the United States and each state are based on populations enumerated in the 2010 census as of July 1, 2013. Rates for Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Marianas are based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2013. Since death rates are affected by the population composition of a given area, age-adjusted death rates should be used for comparisons between areas because they control for differences in population composition. U.S. Total does not include Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Marianas, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. Causes of death attributable to firearm mortality include ICD-10 Codes W32-W34, Accidental discharge of firearm; Codes X72-X74, Intentional self-harm by firearm; X93-X95, Assault by firearm; Y22-Y24, Firearm discharge, undetermined intent; and Y35, Legal intervention involving firearm discharge.

These guys thought that was terrible and several of them said they'd no longer go into any restaurant un-armed.

Most of the violence occurs in US cities.  Your example primarily centres on Europe, and they are no strangers to violence.  I wouldn't trade american domestic issues for those faced in Europe for a second.  You and I aren't likely to see a tank rolling through our neighbourhoods any time soon.  There is a distinct possibility that could happen over there in the next few years. Anyway , I concede defeat to wikepidea statistics, but I stand by what I said, because I believe if we had the same population as the US, with similar levels of poverty and the drugs and crime they have, I'm guessing we'd be in the same boat.

More and more, America is becoming split down the middle ... morally, politically, culturally, behaviorally ...... and interestingly, the boundary of that split is often urban vs. rural.  Lastly, it's also interesting that the large majority of American gun-toting, flag-waving, ammo-hoarding, second amendment cowboys (and yes, they certainly do exist, in large numbers) live in areas with low gun-related crime rates."

936290,Big Cliff,2015-09-24 18:19:00,6899,I have owned guns all my life and was trained to use them at a very early age. I have had hand guns (with permits) since I was in my early 20s. I am an excellent shot and have won many compititions over the years but not once in all those years has having a gun or knowing how to use it made me feel like a hero.  Would I shoot someone? Well I guess I would if I had to but believe me the circumstances would have to be do or die for me or one of my family. I have had to stand my ground a few times through my life and I've had my share of fights but never have I felt the need to pull a gun. I'm almost 70 now and I couldn't hold my own in a good fist fight with some young thoug but I'd sure try before I'd resort to shooting someone.  To take another persons life for any reason has ruined far too many innocent peoples lives. PTSD has probably claimed as many lives as gun fights have.

He has seen more violence there in his entire life except for the war. I told them, warned tem, pleaded with them not to go there. We are looking for another place as we speak. To make my point it all depends where in the city you live. Jane and Finch is rotten apples to sweet oranges when compared to Rosedale in T.O I've been to Tokyo, one can't compare the Ginza with Romaji where all the sex clubs are, I think that's the area.

I got to disagree with this with it being most of but should read a few of would be O.K. It is not a gun slinger mentality that plays into if I have to draw it is improving my odds of walking away from a confrontation that I did not instigate. It is the same way I treat any fight. Step one is talk your way out of it saying anything that will defuse the situation. If that fails then try to back away from the conflict. If that fails then kick yell claw scratch and head butt the person before he is ready to fight. No rules no mercy get them down and incapacitated before you get hurt. Same for a home intrusion assume they are armed, let them have anything material they can carry and if they come into the same room as you are in shoot for the center mass and don't stop till the gun is empty. It is not tough guy talk it is the correct way to get the chances of walking away from an issue in your favor. Some people thing shooting someone is brutal and inhumane however change the gun to alcohol and most people have driven a car drunk and didn't care that THEY are just as deadly as a gun is in that vehicle. I would feel less anger if someone dies by my gun threatening my life than knowing I killed an innocent person while driving drunk. The choice on how to protect ones self and family is a personal one and it all depends on at what point do you feel you have done enough to live with the outcome of the life changing event.  Art"

Could be bad if they had a gun though and just started firing off rounds.  When I was 15 i was assaulted with an aluminum(thank god it wasnt wood) bat with a direct blow to my forehead.

Being the first one to shoot will end the event before you are harmed. Personally I like having guns and pistols and also that others also have them it seems to make people more cautious or hesitate to intrude in places that might have firearms available.  Just my thoughts from a more liberal view that can have weapons legally.  Art

936146,cram,2015-09-23 21:49:00,1733,"Chances are no one on this board will ever have to use one.  In fact, chances are pretty good that no one one this board knows anyone or has a family member who has had to worry about it.  If you're worried, get a dog.  Speaking of which - Manitou, how did your intruder get past your dogs?"
936147,Big Cliff,2015-09-23 21:56:00,6899,"It is so easy to talk tough but when it comes right down to it, taking anothers life is a decision I hope none of you will ever have to make! To break a mans legs with a baseball bat, to shoot him in the leg, where do you get to make that sort of a decision in a split second. I too will defend my family at all cost but my first response would be ""I have a gun and I will use it"". I can't see anyone in their right mind continuing to advance.  I hope none of you find yourself in a position where you have to decide to use deadly force, those that have often suffer as much as or even more than the recepient."

936156,kickingfrog,2015-09-23 22:20:00,8333,Canadian storage laws also make guns less then ideal for home defence.

936162,fishing n autograph,2015-09-23 22:59:00,2540,I guarantee racking and pointing an empty shotgun will be enough to scare the crap out of an intruder.  I don't recommend arming yourself with a knife unless you're trained with using them. They can quickly because a weapon against you.  I suggest a bat. What I suggest to the wife and female friends is he heaviest Pyrex bowl or casserole dish they can swing. Smack that over a persons head its game over.

936168,aplumma,2015-09-23 23:33:00,6896,"Brian a defence load is for the shotgun it is a hornaby critical defense ammo a tight pattern for less spread more lead in the target. For the 9mm it is glaser fragmenting ammo heavy penetration with quick energy release in the point of impact less likely to travel thru the target. Both are extremely deadly and are designed to do maximum damage.  Folks if you pull a gun and you are not 100% sure you can pull the trigger don't even think about bringing it out. It will be the gun that you will get killed with. An intruder in your house is outside of the law he doesn't care to play by the rules , he hopes you will play by the rules and give him a leg up on you. You charge someone with a baseball bat and he has a gun you will not reach him if he is serious on harming you or getting something he wants. In training for the special forces it was drummed into your head  If two men have two guns the first one to shoot wins if you don't believe this 100% don't come out of the bedroom. Don't confuse life and death situations with a scary noise or a drunk knocking on the front door. Cliff life altering situations occur to us all we make decisions daily that affect the outcome of the future. If my choice is to mentally or legally deal with shooting someone who feels he is above the law or hesitate and be shot or worse he shoots my wife I will always take the shot.  It all comes back to what are you willing to risk for something you love be it a wife or daughter or yourself.  Art"

936182,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-24 01:01:00,8243,"A rifle shaft 7 iron is much more effective than the shorter baseball bat. And it will do much more damage if wielded. Aim for the muscle between the neck and the shoulder. If you miss one way or another it will still stop someone in their tracks. That is if you are absolutely sure they do not have a gun. I have never been confronted by an intruder and hope I never am. I only know of 1 person that confronted an intruder and he received a shot gun blast to his arm. Opps M2B2 is the second. The odds here in Canada must be very high. All these home invasions I read about in the last few years have been drug related or by persons that knew the victim and they both were from the same country of origin. The person I did know was confronted by 2 masked men and were there to relieve them of their pain meds, and they knew them personally as well. I think those that do have fire arms are higher on the list for theft than a home where there are none. Guns bring big money and are easier to unload. ( No pun intended but it's a good one)  Loose lips sink ships."

936185,manitoubass2,2015-09-24 01:20:00,11391," If they dont know you they are super nice until you go near one of us then they freak.  I wonder whats happens in a case when an intruder gets mauled by dogs???  And OI the first break in we had was deug fueled,second was alcohol.  Its the drug fueled ones that scare me because they seem capable of anything(of course im more afraid of a rapist/killer/pro thief)  But the drug fueled ones are so unpredictable and you have to act fast.  Any of use ever had a gun drawn on you? As a law abiding citizen its very very scary.  Ive been through it 3 times  Robbed at gunpoint in toronto  Shot aat by two rivals in grande prairie( i just happened to cross the street in the wrong place at the wrong time, could feel shots miss my head twice)  And once by police. Someone reported i hade a gun at the river with children(was just a pellet gun, kids practising while i fished) two cops come fast guns drawn. Thankfully I knew one of them and that calmed the situation quickly.  Anyhow"
