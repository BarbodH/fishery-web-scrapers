937079,Kerry,2015-09-29 02:15:00,383,It just boggles my mind that phone manufacturers and service providers or your dealer that you probably got both from continue to get away with these little 'scams'.When I got my first  phone with data I had really no clue what or how much data I needed nor did I know at the time that with the LG I bought it didnt matter if the screen timed out or not if you checked a web page it was still reading it.Anyway I kept getting a message about my data needed to be increased blah blah.I ended up going on line to my telus account and that is when I found out my phone bill was going to be another 130 bucks and I had only had the phone for about 3 days.Well off to the local office I went and raised bloody h@#ll !! The girl at the office took my phone and showed me how to turn off the data which was like 4 different things to get off a web page.Rediculous!!So after being put on with a telus representative I got the overage reversed once they reviewed the data as it showed just the one page continuously being charged and then I had them turn the data off at their end so it couldn't happen again.It was two years after when I finally got rid of that LG and went to my current phone.Even now I find things or ways of use on my current Android that I see nowhere in a users manual.Computers(smartphones) are supposed to be easy. Anyway take all the people that probably don't complain enough about these things and add that up.Betcha companies make quite a LARGE bonus on that. Thanks for getting this out early Gerritt.Might help more than you know. Kerry

937085,FrankTheRabbit,2015-09-29 03:05:00,479,"I'm using iOS 9 with my iPhone 5s and it's been about a week. I do get small bugs, but overall it's been stable for me. The biggest improvement I found was battery life. Perhaps I had something installed from iOS 8.3, but after a clean install, I'm getting much better battery life. And just before I was thinking of bringing in the phone for a battery replacement...guess that ain't happening anymore.  Overall, I'm satisfied."
