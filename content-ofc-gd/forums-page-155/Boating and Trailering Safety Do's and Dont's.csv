I looked at my friend and he asked if I still had it in 4x4 and I said no. Just as he said to pull over, I saw smoke coming from the trailer tire and then it just shredded into pieces. My first thought was ""Oh no, knowing how ill-prepared my friend normally is, he probably has no jack or tire iron (he did). Looked in the mirror and a tow truck had pulled in right behind us. Two great young guys, they changed the tire at n/c (made them take money for lunch and a beer) in 15 minutes and we were back on our way. When we saw they had a CAA sticker, my friend said he would call it in and then they would get paid by CAA, but apparently they were out ouf their territory and couldn't do a CAA call.

Looked in the boat and it was almost half full of water. So yea pulling the plug is just as important as putting it in.

I always shake the trailer when I hook it on to the truck to see if anything moves in the up down, kind of the same as using a jack, works best with a light boat. I put my hand on and around my hubs at each stop, checking quickly for heat/leaks. I always make sure my tires are less than about 6-7 years old.  They don't get worn down, but they're not that expensive at all, and I like having the peace of mind.  Plus, you can sell the ones on the trailer to help cover the cost, to someone who likes to live more dangerously!  I also always have a half dozen extra rowing boat straps on me, in case I have to tie any/everything down along the way.  2 years ago, pulling out of 3 mile lake, my wife informed me that my ""carpet"" was floating away.  She was talking about my trailer bunker, of course.. I fished it out, and the wood was too rotten to get some screws in, so a couple good wraps with some boat straps, and I was on my way in no time!

My bearings are in good shape and are well maintained. Too tight, no grease, leaky seals, overloaded, etc... are the main problems. Do a yearly check (more often if you trailer often). Lights get checked EVERY single time. The boat is a different story. I keep a dry box filled with cotter pins, tools, fuses, basic first aid kit, etc... a spare prop, prop wrench and piece of wood to wedge the prop for removal (after boating on GBay for years, I can do a Bo and Luke Duke prop change..3-4 minutes). And.... make sure I have at least 1/3rd more fuel than I need for a trip. I ran into people sooo many times that ran out of fuel, to the point I would let them row back in. Breakdowns, running aground, baffing shoals, I would help out. But running out of gas, that is stupidity, plain and simple.

All good stuff here although its easy to get carried away.  Make sure your cell is charged and someone knows where you are. If there's no cell service, then look at renting a Sat phone.  My contingency plans is...   And whatever you do, don't panic."

936408,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-25 02:59:00,8243,"All great suggestions. If I had everything everyone suggests I would have to pull another trailer behind the boat to put it all. But all great. I keep my old ties downs as back ups as well. A spare receiver with a ball including pin. It doesn't help me stored in the shed.  And don't forget the duct tape, lots of it."

936427,G.mech,2015-09-25 11:21:00,830,"Rather than a bearing kit, I just bought a whole hub assembly packed the bearings and sealed it up with my vacuum sealer.  It's not much more than a kit and a lot easier to change the whole thing on the roadside than trying to change bearings, seals etc.  Another thing I learned the hard way is that the lug nuts can become seized and impossible to remove with a tire wrench.  Now I loosen them a re-torque them every spring just to be sure."
936428,OhioFisherman,2015-09-25 11:22:00,6623,"If the coupler isn't all the way down on the ball, you can still latch it shut.  It may look right, but wait for the first bump.  I went to Lake Chautauqua in New York with my buddy to fish a tournament, my boat his pickup. He had a boat also, so I let him hookup mine while I was getting other things for the trip. We made it all the way there, about 180 miles, driving down a hill at the lake my trailer came loose and bumped the back bumper of his truck. Just a scratch on his bumper, but I always cranked down the dolly leg until the tow vehicle started to rise, he didn't, it was a learning experience.  Once you launch your boat and move the trailer to a parking space? Take a minute or two to inspect the trailer, with the boat off the trailer it makes it a lot easier to see broken-cracked welds and such.  My buddy and his son took me fishing to a lake here in Ohio, the next weekend they were heading up to the French River. I looked at his trailer when the boat was in the water and he had some serious broken welds, he had to rush to get them fixed before a long trip.  My brother also had issues with broken welds on his trailer, both had maximum motors on package deals.  Another friend, also on a trip to the French River had a blowout on the trailer on the way home, he had a spare, after fixing it and driving for about an hour? He got a flat on the trailer, one spare on a long trip might not be enough? It made it a lot longer trip home for him!"
936432,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-25 12:00:00,627,Those French River folks are always looking at ways to gain more American Dollars...LOL.  Two flat trailer tires on the same trip would suggest to me that the tires were ready to go prior to the start and should have been replaced then. Not saying it couldn't happen.
936439,DanD,2015-09-25 12:56:00,2223,"Remove the boat's drain plug when on the trailer. On the way home from a trip, we ran into a heavy rain storm; that seemed to follow us for at lease 45 minutes or more. I was pulling my 12 foot tinny with an older 2 wheel drive Dakota and I could feel the truck start working harder and harder to pull this little boat? I thought maybe a wheel bearing was beginning to seize; so I pulled off the highway. Walking back looking down at the wheels; they looked half flat? Looked in the boat and it was almost half full of water. So yea pulling the plug is just as important as putting it in.  Dan."

Tom, at the time I think his boat was only a year or two old, a glass bass boat. Those heavier boats may cause more issues?  My brother's was a 19 foot Bayliner Capri, and unlike most people around here that had them? He got his with a v-8 inboard, all the others I saw were 4 or 6 cylinder.  My buddy's was a couple of year old procraft with a 150, both had single axle trailers, and both had welds break near the rear of the trailer."
936470,Sinker,2015-09-25 14:35:00,8692,"When you inspect your trailer....take a good close look at the frame where the spring mounts are. My trailer broke right off, under the spring shackles. I was lucky no thing serious happened. I inspect everything every time I have the boat off now, and every once in a while go through it all and make sure all the nuts/bolts/screws are tight.  I also carry a whole hub assembly with me. Its a lot easier to replace the whole hub than the bearings.  S."
