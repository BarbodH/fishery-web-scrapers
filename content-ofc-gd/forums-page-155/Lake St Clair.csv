Fortunately, I am heading out to St Clair tomorrow. Was wondering if anyone knew if the shad were congregating at the river mouths yet or are temps too warm still. Will affect what kind of gear I bring tomorrow (ie trolling vs casting). PM's always welcomed too!"
936814,bobkayla,2015-09-27 21:46:00,148,"Last I heard no musky or shad in the river,,,,need  some cooler weather"
936852,Rizzo,2015-09-28 01:26:00,4754,Thanks Bob. We will give it a shot and see what happens. Start right from the launch and head further out if nobody is in tight yet!
936860,leaf4,2015-09-28 02:07:00,2466,"Not sure where they fish out of, but I follow a charters page on Facebook and they've had a great year so far, pond predator fishing charters, maybe the pics can help ya out"
936861,Joey,2015-09-28 02:09:00,9122,"Good Luck Rog, I feel your pain, haven't fished as much this year either, nor gone to St. Clair    Hope you do well bud!"
937022,PBenson,2015-09-28 22:55:00,154,Waters definitely not cool enough yet to get large numbers in the rivers. Probably better off trolling (coming from a guy who doesn't troll)
937220,Rizzo,2015-09-29 22:20:00,4754,"Just wanted to give a bit of an update. We got on the water around 8:45 am, cast for 10 minutes or so at the mouth of the marina (Belle River) then set up to do some trolling. We ended up getting 4 before noon (3 were just under 40, and one was 44) but at noon conditions changed. Sun came out, the water laid down and the fish shut off. We stayed til 3, only having one more rip for our efforts but that fish didn't hook up. Was good to get out there though!"
937223,lew,2015-09-29 22:28:00,12766,Sounds like a good day Roger.
937226,misfish,2015-09-29 22:38:00,29133, You mean you forgot about the bass bite  You musky guys dont know what your missing.  Nice fish Rog.
937228,lew,2015-09-29 22:41:00,12766, You mean you forgot about the bass bite  You musky guys dont know what your missing.  Nice fish Rog.  He didn't fish for bass Brian cause he already had enough bait
937237,leaf4,2015-09-29 23:01:00,2466,Sounds like a good day thanks for sharing!
937248,Pigeontroller,2015-09-29 23:40:00,2793,"I'd say the fall migration to river mouths has started...This 51"" girl was caught in 6 fow just outside the Thames mouth Sunday. Water temps are still 68 degrees though... "
937284,Rizzo,2015-09-30 01:49:00,4754,dang...knew I shoulda gone to Thames! Nice fish.
