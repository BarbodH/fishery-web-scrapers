937555,Rod Caster,2015-10-01 12:25:00,5784,Not sure I would do the 'bite test' hahaha.  Get yourself a mushroom field guide and do the spore color test.... although someone here might have an idea what kind this one is.
937585,Dozer,2015-10-01 16:03:00,896,"Don't take my word for it but it does look like a regular white button mushroom - depending on what you mean by large.  Other than that, just looking at the thing, I would say it does resemble some sort of rusulla.  A stalk would help with a better ID.  I'd stay on the safe side and pass on eating this mushroom until you have a solid ID."
937587,Toronto_Angler,2015-10-01 16:12:00,698,So you took a bite without knowing what it was? Death Wish?
937589,Dozer,2015-10-01 16:34:00,896,"Taking a bite to figure out what taste it has is a way to check if the mushroom, in general, is edible or not in the field.  Typically a mushroom bad for your health will sting your tongue and should be spit out and discarded.  However, this method is not 100% reliable."
937677,Kawartha Kev,2015-10-01 23:47:00,281,Looks like Agaricus campestris the common meadow mushroom but a little tough to tell for sure have a look here for some more info and pics if you are interested http://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_campestris.html  Kawartha Kev
