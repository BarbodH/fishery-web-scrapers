935863,captpierre,2015-09-22 19:03:00,2521,Happened again this morning. Lost a diving crank trolling on the outside  curve of a weed edge. I'm thinking the line caught the weeds and the zebra mussel growing on them cut the line.  Happened earlier in the summer. Likely on the rocks/mussels.  Was using 30 lb PP alone. Then added 4 ft Fluoro 12lb leader.  Problem stopped. This morning it failed again. Checked leader for nicks/strength before troll. Put on 25 lb Fluoro leader. Was rewarded with PB 'eye 10 am. Blue sky. Flat water. 25 inch fatty. Thought I had a ski on. Seems the leader didn't hinder. Picture coming.

936581,mike rousseau,2015-09-26 01:07:00,4661,Are you fishing water with pike and musky?  Lots of zebra mussels here and that almost never happens... I'd have to hammer my crank Into zebra infested rocks repeatedly to maybe break off...  If mussels were the culprit your lead or line would be damaged near the break...  Was it a clean cut or a rough cut?
936583,captpierre,2015-09-26 01:17:00,2521,Pigeon Lake so lots of skis. The break offs don't  involve a strike as far as i can tell but I guess sharp teeth could do it too.
936601,mike rousseau,2015-09-26 12:20:00,4661,When Muskie do get my lure (rare) you usually don't feel much...  One took my hot n tot the other day and my rod tip barely bounced...  Reeled up and it looked like scissors cut my line... No rough marks...
936647,captpierre,2015-09-26 18:36:00,2521,All the more reason to beef up the Fluoro. Not supposed to be able to see it.
