For years Ive fished with them both, and they always were amazed at how well I knew the waters and techniques.  Thats all they talked about was winning that tourny, and we had great times trying to strategize spots, etc.  Day one I get a text saying I got two big fish! Contact stops there as I dont wanna jinx them.  They are in second.  Day two im busy with work so I couldnt make it. I told my wife ""they are down 3lbs to the leaders, they need a good day and for them to have a bad day"".  Well I get a txt at 3 from tricia, ""!!!!!""  Thats it, i know they got kickers?  I get the call around 430 that they had won by 4lbs!!!!  Shortly after she calls me crying and tells me the bite was dead, so they took some of my advice and got lucky lol.  Im just posting this because im real proud of them? all those deep v's and bass boats lost to a girl in a tinnie!!!  Not that that really matters, im just really happy for them?  15 grand is a decent payday!!!"

936731,lew,2015-09-27 11:59:00,12766,"all those deep v's and bass boats lost to a girl in a tinnie!!  Just goes to show you don't need a big $$$$ boat to catch a fish  Congrats to your family Rick, that's outstanding !!"
936742,solopaddler,2015-09-27 13:09:00,8605,"Cool, congrat's to them!"
936748,Basschaser77,2015-09-27 14:09:00,32,Outstanding!!!!  Great example that fishing is not only about the equipment.
936750,manitoubass2,2015-09-27 14:30:00,11391,"Thanks guys!  Shes one of the best jig anglers I know! She catches big walleye!  I guess they celebrated hard last night???  Txt this morning""did I really win""?  Yes, yes you did lol"
936862,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-28 02:16:00,470,THATS AWESOME!!   Congrats to them! I'd have celebrated pretty hard too!!!
936877,Garnet,2015-09-28 10:22:00,2056,"That's what great tournament fishing is about. Get your strategy work the details, make adjustments and make it look like luck.  Nice job."
936948,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-28 17:28:00,8243,"Now how great is that? Man the trophy is almost the size of the Stanley Cup. Plus they get to put some cash in their jeans. Forget the fact that those guys were beat out by a lady. I find women that enjoy angling out fish guys regularly, me for sure. Something to do with pheromones I once read."
936980,jimmer,2015-09-28 20:14:00,2730,That's amazing and a great pay cheque to boot!
937028,manitoubass2,2015-09-28 23:40:00,11391, My guess is thats where the cash goes after a few gifts for nephews ans nieces?
937042,captpierre,2015-09-29 00:22:00,2521,Great story and happy for the Tinnie  Gang!
