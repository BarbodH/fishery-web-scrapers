937324,OhioFisherman,2015-09-30 12:34:00,6623,"Looking around on line. Seems the flipping switch is a must for trolling/bottom bouncing. Can somebody explain how it works?  I believe all the reels I have with a flipping switch are older Abu reels and I am not sure on other brands or newer reels. There is a button for the off - on position for the flipping feature, with it on? when you let go of the line release button? it engages the spool without turning the reel handle. With it of it acts like a normal casting reel, cast and then turn the handle to engage the spool.  I trolled ( long line ) for years and never used a flipping reel, the thumbar style reels made things so much easier! Most of my trolling, for everything, was done in shallower water though, 30 feet or less.  If you are using downriggers,, dipsys? I can see where a line counter would help, especially for walleye - trout - salmon suspended over deep water."
937427,captpierre,2015-09-30 20:17:00,2521,"So instead of pressing the thumb bar to let line out and then turning the crank to stop the line release, you just hold the flipping switch down and line is released as long as you hold it down? Then the spool stops as if the crank is turned? Sounds perfect."
937431,OhioFisherman,2015-09-30 20:38:00,6623,"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Abu-Garcia-Ambassadeur-Ultra-Mag-xl-Plus-NIB-/151829163404?hash=item2359b92d8c  No Capt, you put the switch in the on mode and the thumbar still releases the line, but as soon as you lease the thumbar the spool is engaged. If you shut off the flipping switch the reel operates like a normal baitcaster.  The 4th picture gives you the best look, those reels are for the late 70's-early 80's."

You can see the switch to activate the flipping feature better. I have never owned a Quantum reel.
937489,Sinker,2015-09-30 23:44:00,8692,"Yes, exactly. They are great for trolling bouncers for that reason.  S."
937511,OhioFisherman,2015-10-01 01:23:00,6623,"Yes, exactly. They are great for trolling bouncers for that reason.  S.  Unless they have changed their operation? You don't hold the flipping switch down once it is set into flipping mode, you hold down the thumbar, once you release it the reel spool engages."
937558,Sinker,2015-10-01 13:10:00,8692,"Sorry, I just Re-read his question.  pushing the thumb bar releases line, and letting off the thumb bar stops line. One handed line release, with no need to turn the handle. Great for bottom bouncing. Turn the flipping switch off and it works like a normal baitcaster.  S."

937581,Consigliere,2015-10-01 15:27:00,121,Tekota 300 is a really nice real for trolling walleye. It's pretty light and small but enough line capacity to run boards. Comes as counter or not.
937584,captpierre,2015-10-01 16:01:00,2521,Thanks Guys. Great advice. Options Couldn't find metered PP at Sail. Must be very new.
937586,porkpie,2015-10-01 16:08:00,2521,"Mine was special order.  You can get fire line tracer at canadian tire, but the way they meter is different and not as good from my point of view.  The tracer they have at my ct only comes in 40lb test.  Better than nothing I guess."
937032,captpierre,2015-09-28 23:48:00,2521,"Hi Gents. Been using an older Abu Eon as a walleye trolling rod. Wasn't the best but it got the job done. Well, it got real sick yesterday. After opening it up, it died on the table. Looking for a bullet proof Bait  Caster for slow  trolling 30 lb braid.  Occasionally casting. Was wondering if such a thing comes with a line counter. I have a great Diawa trolling real with counter  for  salmon/ dipsey trolling but it's too big for Pigeon Lake. Anybody have any  suggestions? Yah and not too expensive. Preferably under $200. Thanks Peter"
937048,porkpie,2015-09-29 00:28:00,2521,"17 series diawa line counter.  The accudepth is cheap and works well.  I have the 20 series okuma convector, but I don't like it as well.  I also recently bought  garcia silver max reels for my bottom bouncer rods, and they are pretty cheap and effective and they have a flipping switch for letting out line one handed.  Not bad for casting either.  I'm using powerpro metered line on them so I can use them for pulling cranks with some repeatability. It not quite the same as a line counter, but it works ok."
937052,Fang,2015-09-29 00:35:00,1330,If it's strictly trolling the the shimano tekota 300LC is about as good as it gets.The Okuma cold water reels are newer in the market and so far no issues that I hear about. A size 15 should work for your needsIf you cast as we'll then Abu 5500 or 6500 come in line counters too
937064,Fisherpete,2015-09-29 01:15:00,1814,X 2 on Shimano Tekota. I have 500's and 600's for muskie and salmon trolling and they are bulletproof. Don't see why the 300 size wouldn't be just as good. Pretty close to the $200 mark when on sale.
937071,Steve,2015-09-29 01:28:00,2075,i have two tekota 300lc's.  they are nice!  can't see casting when them though.
937076,GBW,2015-09-29 01:44:00,8460,get a reel you like and don't worry about the line counter part as you can buy a clip on to the rod line counter. http://www.basspro.com/Berkley-Line-Counter/product/10220051/

937091,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 04:51:00,4661,Accudepth 17 is a great counter for trolling... No good for casting tho...
937099,Steve,2015-09-29 10:58:00,2075,accudepths do not hold up in the cold.....  but the daiwa sealines do.

937106,OhioFisherman,2015-09-29 11:32:00,6623,"I think the Abu Eon was one of Abu's short lived reels, they seem to of had a number of them after the 1970's.  http://www.fishingwithpiotr.com/fishing-maps/pigeon-lake/  That is the limit of my knowledge of the lake, it doesn't appear to be a deep lake, is a line counter really needed?  If price is a concern?  http://www.basspro.com/Shimano-Citica-I-Series-LowProfile-Baitcast-Reel/product/2229765/  That should do fine for walleye trolling, a 200 series, and you get a lefty-righty choice."
937111,Headhunter,2015-09-29 13:12:00,5703,"You'll be hard pressed to find a line-counter that will cast effectively. I've seen it done with a Sealine, but it wasn't pretty! Those clip on line counters are a royal pain in the ba doop due, especially if you are late season trolling. They don't like cold weather. HH"
937129,porkpie,2015-09-29 14:24:00,2521,"They don't?  I have 2 that say otherwise.  I agree the sealines are a better reel, but the accudepth has been pretty good to me for the buck.  Mind you I still have a cheap rapala line counter that hasn't imploded yet, so I must be good at finding unicorns.  Admittedly the rapala doesn't see much use though.  I've used the accudepths pretty hard and late into the season with no real issues."
937130,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 14:27:00,4661,Mine do...  I break ice to fish in December and they perform fine...  Especially at that price point
937151,NANUK,2015-09-29 16:12:00,797,"Newer accudepths are good reels, I service my own reels and the newer (grey) accudepths are build identical to salines minus the bearings, I wouldn't recommend them for every day Lake Ontario kings but for a weekend warrior they are good, Excellent for walleye. Old black & gold accudepths were junk."
937169,captpierre,2015-09-29 17:16:00,2521,"So Gents. Instead of a reel counter, Is there a good Baitcaster for the job? Easy to let line out. I guess they all do that by thumb Would be used mostly for trolling cranks, harnesses.  30 lb braid."
937170,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 17:21:00,4661,Any will do that...
937174,scugpg,2015-09-29 17:46:00,1373,Wouldn't you want one with a bait clicker though if your not trolling with reel in hand?  Not many bait casters have a clicker though. Revo Toro NaCl does in a 50 series. Not sure of others?
937178,porkpie,2015-09-29 18:47:00,2521,"Cheap and effective?  So far I'm liking the 2 garcia silver max reels I got.  No idea how well they will hold up long term though.  They cast as well as a shimano citica, can be had for $60-70 on sale and seem to so the job pretty well.  I bought them just for my bottom bouncer rods, but used them as casting rods at the cottage a few times when we where just doing a quick overnight and It was too much hassle to pull the boat with all my gear. So far so good.  Added bonus is the flipping switch, which is great for letting out line one handed when bottom rigging.  Second choice, Citica.  A little more money,but very reliable."

The info in this thread sure helps.  I do like the line counter though. After a few times out you get to know exactly what line lengh will do the trick with a lot less hangups.

937303,porkpie,2015-09-30 03:31:00,2521,"It's not a must, it's just a handy feature.  I can drive the boat, fiddle with sonar, and click the flipping switch with my thumb to drop my bouncer an additional 5 feet to account for depth change, and I don't have to turn the handle on the reel which works for me as I use downeast holders mainly.  Your mileage may vary."
