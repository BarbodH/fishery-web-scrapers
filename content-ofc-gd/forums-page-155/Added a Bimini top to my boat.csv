366573,PERCHER,2009-07-27 01:05:00,787,Rob that's awsome.
366781,Abraxus,2009-07-27 15:51:00,104,"Hey Memart,  Where in Pickering did you get this and how much did it cost?  This definately looks like something I would want on my own boat.  Thanks!  Ab"
366784,Roy,2009-07-27 16:10:00,13728,Nice piece of work there Rob but that ain't no  bimini.
936937,jackyngai,2015-09-28 16:58:00,1,Can you send me email for the cost and their contact info?  [email protected]  Thanks
936967,misfish,2015-09-28 19:31:00,29133,You are better to pm him for contact. He no longer has that boat.
936974,irishfield,2015-09-28 19:54:00,26272,I imagine the price has changed in SIX years as well....
936988,glen,2015-09-28 20:28:00,2641,I wonder if he liked that top at Boq.
365945,medmart,2009-07-25 01:38:00,587,Well with all the rain we have been having i decided to add a Bimini top to my boat and some side curtains now this year fishing the BQ in the fall will be alot warmer what do you's think     Rob
365947,Terry,2009-07-25 01:47:00,14456,"yeah, let it snow and blow at the BOQ , you will be dry and warm  till someone yells fish on...LOL  looks real good"
365949,Fisherman,2009-07-25 01:48:00,7201,"Well, while the rest of us are out there getting wet and being lashed by waves you'll be ""high and dry"", nothing wrong with that.   I would drop it for trailering though."
365952,pike slayer,2009-07-25 01:56:00,1177,to me it looks a little dorky but DARN nice to have and you'll be laughing at all the other suckers out there while you can sit back and relax plus you'll probably get more fishing time in which is a bonus
