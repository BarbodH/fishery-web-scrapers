935888,lew,2015-09-22 20:32:00,12766,"Hey guys, I've got 3 LED pot lights in the kitchen ceiling with a 3 way switch at either end of the room so I can turn them on & off from either side.  I'd like to install a 3 way dimmer switch at the end of the room we always use and wonder if that's possible. The switch at the other end just leads to another room and is never used.  I don't know which switch is 1st in line though and I'd imagine that makes a difference.    "
935894,Bill Shearer,2015-09-22 20:51:00,456,"Boy, do I want to see how this can be explained!"
935896,lew,2015-09-22 20:53:00,12766,"Boy, do I want to see how this can be explained!  I'm wondering if I'll even understand the explanation LOL"
935901,Ksword,2015-09-22 21:22:00,40,"Sure you can.  3 way 'mechanical dimmer, ie LUTRON Skylark' at one location,and a 3 way switch at second.  3 conductors between them just like with the switch.  OR...a 3 way 'electronic dimmer ie LUTRON MAESTRO' at one location and its ' Accessory Dimmer' at the other.  Same wiring as above.  With this setup, the lights can be turned on/off AND dimmed from both locations.  Because they are LED lights, you should make sure you get the 'C.L' version (specifically designed for LED and CFL dimmable bulbs) for the best dimming performance.  Home Depot will have all these devices in stock..."
935904,lew,2015-09-22 21:36:00,12766,"Thanks Kenny  Just so I'm clear, I can leave the 3 way switch we never use as is and just install the mechanical 3 way dimmer where I want it and everything should work fine.  I'll be able to turn the lights off and on with the dimmer switch plus dim them down."
935908,irishfield,2015-09-22 21:54:00,26272,"Can go at either end Lew, just pull the switch out you want to be a dimmer and replace it wire for wire onto the new dimmer. I have had them throughout the house for 20 years, but as Kenny advised make sure you get the latest greatest for those LED's.  Have Diane stand there with a broom stick or turn off the power, either method works!"
935911,lew,2015-09-22 22:00:00,12766,"Thanks Wayne, changing the switches is no problem I just didn't know if it would work with both a dimmer and a standard switch. Gives me a job to do tomorrow.   As for Diane, she keeps the broom stick handy even when I'm not doing electrical."
935932,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-23 00:01:00,627,"Along with the broomstick, have Diane dial the first two numbers of 91-------1"
935934,ketchenany,2015-09-23 00:04:00,3229,"I've changed a lot of switches, ran into a 'bridge' problem once but NEVER  a broomstick solution If I don't need to go to the box please explain Wayne, my light bulb is starting to fade"
935936,ecmilley,2015-09-23 00:06:00,2163,NO probs lew have a couple I wired up here.
935961,sofabed,2015-09-23 01:45:00,119,This is no issue at all. One point I don't think was mentioned above is to also make sure your CSL and/or LED bulbs are rated to be used with a dimmer switch. The new electronic dimmers will list compatible bulbs.
936216,Ksword,2015-09-24 11:58:00,40,"Lew - Sofabed is right - make sure that the bulb you pick is dimmable, because some types are not dimmable."
936217,lew,2015-09-24 12:12:00,12766,"Lew - Sofabed is right - make sure that the bulb you pick is dimmable, because some types are not dimmable.  I  checked my bulbs yesterday and there's nothing written on them to indicate if their dimmable or not so how would I know ??  I'm actually going into town this morning to buy the switch you recommended so maybe I'll just buy 3 proper bulbs to be sure."
936243,Canuck2fan,2015-09-24 14:51:00,1444,Lew if you have a printer save some money....  The Tractor Supply Comany stores also have LED's that work with dimmer switches on sale until tomorrow.

936280,lew,2015-09-24 17:16:00,12766,"Thanks boys, the jobs all done and everythings working perfectly.  I contacted the manufacturer this morning to verify my bulbs were indeed dimmable and they checked and said yup, your good to go. Went into town and bought the dimmer and it took 5 minutes to change everything.  As mentioned above, I've changed many switches over the years but never swapped a switch for a dimmer when there was a 2nd switch involved and wanted to be 100% sure it would work."
936309,Whopper,2015-09-24 19:03:00,2174,Your hired Lew
936313,lew,2015-09-24 19:15:00,12766,Actually Phil I was hoping you'd volunteer to come up and do it for me LOL
936370,Ksword,2015-09-24 23:38:00,40,Glad it worked out.
937744,Ronzo,2015-10-02 13:25:00,124,"Looks like a good deal on dimmable LED lights at Tiger Direct today -> $24.95 minus a $20 rebate = $4.95 each. Saw this deal and thought of this thread. Reading the review that's on the site, sounds like they might be too bright for indoors, though.  http://www.tigerdirect.ca/sectors/category/deal-of-the-dayca.asp?  I've ordered from them in the past and have never had any issues."
