Hit the Cleo with the flashlight for ten seconds and cast and retrieve. Husky Jerk or even a Flatfish should entice a bite. All that said, be sure that your equipment is in top shape, cause after all that time fishin and limited catchin, I'd sure hate to see you get spooled when a spotted carp grabs that Cleo. Definitely a learning experience the first time that happens! LOL HH I have pictured myself running to the end the pier to avoid being spooled. I am pretty sure I have one of the glow in the dark cleo's around somewhere. Sounds like a need to spend some time fishing a little higher up in the water column as well. Two rods it is, next time."

Considering going every night until I catch something. Been drop shotting mostly, tossed a spoon around last night, might try a big jerk bait tonight."

934971,fishindevil,2015-09-18 08:38:00,6254,Like I said do not give up and wait for the bait to come in should be in the next few weeks !! And fish it right into the late fall/ early winter ..... With what I said in the above post Even cast a xrap ghost color jerkbait and a few various cranks both floating and medium divers

With what I said in the above post Even cast a xrap ghost color jerkbait and a few various cranks both floating and medium divers No quit is this dog, I need to catch something in the Channel, even if its just a perch.  What do you think about this idea? I have heard of people drop shotting  for suspended small mouth in the fall with the bait well off the bottom.  I was thinking of trying to mimic  this technique  by using  a float  with the drop shop setup to keep my bait vertical. Problem tho, how will I cast with ten ft of line.  Anyways as we get deeper into fall, I thought I should be slowing down my presentation to a crawl ??? Again thanks for the pointers and encouragement, I will catch something:)"
935073,John Bacon,2015-09-18 19:59:00,3277,"Problem tho, how will I cast with ten ft of line.   A slip float may solve that problem.  If you are near the lake end of the channel the waves may add a little action to the presentation."

Found walking along channel from north - south - north while pulling a RattlinRap or curly tail jig right tight to metal side or bank produced small bass. Needed to be tipped with worm always. Get some worms.       Can always get a few bullhead by hook/worm and a few splitshot thrown out there 'til you get a bite.

935467,hunteronwheels,2015-09-20 21:59:00,112,i fished the channel this morning and afternoon on the west side got 2 smallie 1 largemouth and a white bass and then i got a 42 inch pike good and fat too
936796,John Bacon,2015-09-27 19:03:00,3277,"I fished the channel for a few minutes today.  I caught a bull head.  Not the fish that I was expecting to catch on a Rattlin Spot; but, then again, I caught one on a Jitterbug once.  I probably should have stayed in the channel because I didn't get anything in the bay."
933644,Cloudy15,2015-09-11 01:05:00,141,"Hey, Does anyone think fishing the channel leading out to the lake is worth while this time of year(small mouth)?And, am I crazy for thinking that it will hold walleye especially late oct early nov?"
933647,John Bacon,2015-09-11 01:17:00,3277,Walleye would be a long shot.  There are very few of them anywhere around there.  I am sure that there are few walleye in there from time to time; but I would bother targeting them?  I think that you would have a much better chance at a small mouth or even a trout.  Will you be fishing from shore or a boat?  I used to see people fishing the rock piles around the two outer channel markers from boats.  That area is accessible from shore now.  Do you fish the bay very often?  That is usually where I launch my boat.

I found a few decent spots to catch large mouth and pike from shore. I've tried drop shotting the channel a few times at night with no luck. Not sure how deep the channel is, but it just seems like such a fishy spot to me. I feel like it should hold a little bit of everything depending on the time of year."
933651,Dave Bailey,2015-09-11 01:29:00,1641,"I'm just up the road, often thought of giving it a go. I'm guessing the rocks should hold smallmouth, it's typical habitat. Might want to try casting a drop-shot along them."
