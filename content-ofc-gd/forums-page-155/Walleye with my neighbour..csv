It took us longer to get there than it did to get a limit and that's just fine…win/win! Get to mess around in the great outdoors and experience awesome fishing.  I'm pretty lucky to have such a great neighbour, top bloke!         PS….Thanks Joeytier for helping me decide where to go that day, your back lake adventures were the inspiration for this one and the reason we tried a smaller lake."

Yep, great neighbor  LOL...you noticed. Its more to do with what music is available to use on 'monetized' videos on youtube. I finally discovered in May this year, after 8 years of making videos that Youtube will pay me, only catch is I cant choose copyrighted material or they wont pay me, I aint making millions but have made about $700 in 6 months, keeps me in minnows....just!  Don't have to have a $20000 boat to have a blast.  Well done   LOL...my neighbour has a $30000 boat, and that little tinny!"
