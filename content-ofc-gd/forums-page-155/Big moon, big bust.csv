My choice would have been to go hunting but Ryan asked to go fishing since he gets to more actively participate.  Most of the areas we wanted to try already had someone else and I'd rather try a new water rather than crowd another boat. We bounced around looking for some topwater fish and only had few hits and a couple of hook-ups, but only a single bass in the boat. Made it home before the end of the Jay's game.        Did get a bird the other day as well. I was really hoping to have some fish to go with it. "

Think Savage bought them at sometime and continued the same gun under their banner, but that checkering looks like a 50's era gun. Nice bird, they were my favourite."
936833,Acountdeleted,2015-09-28 00:06:00,2562,Same here. My grandfather and I fished from 6am to 9am and only ended up with 2. Ah well.
936836,kickingfrog,2015-09-28 00:08:00,8333,Ya it's a Stevens 16 gauge that I picked up this summer from EPPS. First bird with it.
936851,Beavertail,2015-09-28 01:18:00,331,Nice way to break it in! Guess it's a keeper.
