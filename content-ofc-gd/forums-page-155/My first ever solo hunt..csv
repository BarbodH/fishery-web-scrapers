They were pretty tame and allowed me to follow them into the bush a fair ways, got really close to all of them.  Got some nice splake yesterday so lunch is looking pretty good, got the spruce hens in brine at the moment and a nice wild chanterell sauce to accompany for the ultimate surf and turf!   Video has some blood....   "

I'd like to hear more about this chantrell sauce  It is just thoughts in my grey matter at the moment, thinking about sautee breast in garlic and shallots then add chaterelles, …..dash of cognac or sherry….cream….something like that…then grill trout with a lemon butter and flaked almonds….."
