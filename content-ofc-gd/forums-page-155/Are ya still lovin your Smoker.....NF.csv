936924,fisher,2015-09-28 16:15:00,451,Poor VW dealers and sales people. Can't imagine many people walking in to buy a VW now.  On autoshop last night they said to wait and see what VW is going to do before thinking of buying one of the affected models (used or new).  Sucks to be an owner of one of these and needing to sell.
937059,Steve,2015-09-29 01:05:00,2075,"ok, now they are truly in trouble.  Germany has given VW 10 days to present a solution or they will kick all affected cars off the road!! http://blog.caranddriver.com/germany-gives-volkswagen-10-days-to-present-solution-to-diesel-emissions-problem/"
937077,Gerritt,2015-09-29 02:01:00,6129," Others in the EU will fall suit..... The lawsuits are going to astronomical! I can't see how they will survive this, an entire planet suing.... Governments, environmental agencies, customers, dealers....  Absolutely mind boggling how they thought they could get away with this!  G"
937078,Gerritt,2015-09-29 02:05:00,6129,"I wonder if VW cars in Canada will be called in for emissions testing under the drive clean program, due to this....  The buyers are the ones being punished here."
937142,Dara,2015-09-29 15:36:00,3052,"I wonder if VW cars in Canada will be called in for emissions testing under the drive clean program, due to this....  The buyers are the ones being punished here.   Southern On is really the only drive clean area...I'll buy your VW diesel...I won't give you much but I'll buy it...no drive clean here"
937145,Raf,2015-09-29 15:45:00,3495,"like i said earlier these cars will pass driveclean no problem.  there's no sniffer test, just plug it into the computer and make sure no CEL -- that's basically the test.  my bid starts at $1."
937157,BillM,2015-09-29 16:40:00,17367,"I wonder if VW cars in Canada will be called in for emissions testing under the drive clean program, due to this....  The buyers are the ones being punished here.  Diesels are already tested under Drive Clean in Ontario...  OBDII test.   They'll still pass emissions without issue."
937158,Raf,2015-09-29 16:42:00,3495,...which really shows how big a joke this ontario drive clean is.  but i digress.
937162,Gerritt,2015-09-29 16:53:00,6129,What I meant was I could see Wynne having these cars sniff tested (under drive clean) or taken off the road unless taxed for the emissions they are spewing....  I could certainly see something happening..... Governments are always looking to make a buck
937164,BillM,2015-09-29 17:00:00,17367,"What I meant was I could see Wynne having these cars sniff tested (under drive clean) or taken off the road unless taxed for the emissions they are spewing....  I could certainly see something happening..... Governments are always looking to make a buck  I realize these cars are exceeding EPA requirements, but let's take a look at the overall picture here.  It's a drop in the bucket when compared to anything else with a diesel engine on the road..   I can't imagine how much it would cost to completely redo the standards for driveclean for a few hundred thousand TDI's on our roads.  VW is going to recall the cars, flash them, they'll meet emissions, they'll probably get a few less MPGs, owners will be compensated and that will be the end of it."
937176,irishfield,2015-09-29 17:56:00,26272,"Give it a couple weeks and then buy a chunk of VW shares...  As for the emissions, I see VW's clever way no different than GMC pumping air into the exhaust for the past 30 years to dilute the PPM coming out. Similar to sewer plants adding fresh water to their discharge system to bring their output to regulation PPM standards."
937780,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-02 16:05:00,10439,Interesting video on the issue.

936287,Headhunter,2015-09-24 18:03:00,5703,"$30 odd BILLION in stock decline.... there's gonna be a few out of work Mexicans in the coming weeks. Question is, can these cars legally pass the Fresh Air test and what if anything can Volkswagen do to fix it? Then, there will be all those folks in class action lawsuits wanting compensation or a new car. Interesting times ahead. HH"
936292,woodenboater,2015-09-24 18:25:00,2277,"haha, thread title had me fooled, was about to say yeah Imma gonna do some side ribs this weekend lol.  yeah, VW really, really screwed themselves over because of a few extra kms or hps. a class action will devastate them and from what I understand, veedub would probably lose. worst part for me is the damage they've done to diesel. this will set back diesel in NA for some years to come. greedy my mom hates me."
936293,Raf,2015-09-24 18:28:00,3495,"they'll all pass because the current ontario drive clean just checks the car's computer to make sure the handful of emissions devices are operating correctly.  which they are.  we have no sniffer test anymore and even if we did, the computer apparently knows a test is being done and switches to 'clean' mode.  since the issue is with the software on the computer itself,  i suspect there will be a recall that will reprogram the computer to 'fix' the software which many people will avoid doing because it will involve a negative hit to the mpg / hp.  since there's no such thing as a mandatory recall and no way for the mto to know if a recall was performaed, these vehicles will remain on the road, business as usual.  if they somehow mandate the recall,  tdi ecus will become a hot commodity as owners will want a spare."

936325,farsider,2015-09-24 20:25:00,456,"At least in California, I believe they will have to buy back the cars.  The EPA fines, the class actions, torpedoed business reputation and valuation, demoralizing the diesel sector....  time to pack up and go home boys.  My question is...when can the sitting smugly ""clean"" diesel owners go back to sitting smugly?  Cheers, Mark"

936407,NANUK,2015-09-25 02:58:00,797,"VW has set aside approx 10 billion dollars the deal with this issue, and that is just the start !! Over 30% plunge in stocks already, This doesn't sound like business as usual to me, This is bigger than anything auto industry has ever seen. This is not a mistake or an oversight, a faulty part or defect in workmanship, it was deliberately done to cheat environmental laws and regulations. I know $10B buys a lot of lawyers but class action lawsuits and Govt penalties are going to get very ugly for VW,"

When it comes to vehicles people have short memories....I am shocked anybody would buy a GM product after they were murdering their customer and got caught try to cover it up....It would be nice if consumers sent them a strong clear message!!!

I know guys that used to test cars with half the injectors out of them. Can't do that now. I bet there are a lot of manufacturers sort of shuffling away."

Wish I hadn't the gas mileage and the oil change savings doesn't save me much money when the regular maintenance cost is astronomical Exactly why I got rid of my last VW golf in 2013. From 1986 until 2013 I drove 3 different VW Golfs. Back in 86 diesel was way cheaper then gas and there service was expensive but not out of line. Every year diesel got more expensive and so did VW service.  Have not regretted my decision in 2013...actually feel even better about it now knowing I'm not supporting a company run by a bunch of crooks.

VW thing appears to be outright fraud and deceit with an asinine response and coverup. To their buyers, to the EPA, to the states and Countries that have allowed the vehicles/dealers on the road under deceitful certifications, to their shareholders who thought the company would operate in the best interests of the company...
