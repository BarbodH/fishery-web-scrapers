937305,mike rousseau,2015-09-30 04:52:00,4661,Holy cow...  Just saw what these are selling for online right now...  Amazon has em for $300-$500 for used ones!!!  Looks like I'm selling mine... I don't even use it....  Unreal how value jumps when things are discontinued...
937309,porkpie,2015-09-30 08:42:00,2521,"Maybe selling them for that price, but I doubt they will get it.  I have seen em sell for $100 on walleye central.  There is an app for that now lol. I think I'll keep mine."
937316,ckewley,2015-09-30 11:13:00,699,"I'm sure you know that Amazon sellers greatly inflate the value of just about everything. I'm a movie buff (VHS, DVD, BLU...etc) I'd be a millionaire if I could get the prices they're asking for films, it never hurts to try though."
937339,manitoubass2,2015-09-30 13:46:00,11391,Keep it for your son mike  Im sure hed find it pretty cool when hes older
937544,fishindevil,2015-10-01 08:32:00,6254,I believe I have the first 4 bibles they came out with but one is damaged from being wet and not dried out properly ...they have been a great help too and def helped put fish in the boat if you followed the proper line diameter and speed the dive curves were pretty dead on too !!! Many years of using them  for big water trolling .... Nice to know they are getting very valuable $$$$$
937546,singingdog,2015-10-01 10:08:00,1047,Never tried it. How fast do you troll a bible? Seems to me that it would be tough to keep it at any depth without a downrigger. Are you targeting Baptists?
937554,mike rousseau,2015-10-01 12:19:00,4661,"Nope... Walleye that make you say ""oh my god""  Snap weights or Leadcore help keep them down at the right depth..."
