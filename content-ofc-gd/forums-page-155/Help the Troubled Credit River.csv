937369,John Bacon,2015-09-30 14:47:00,3277,"I didnt realize that the MNR doesnt have their own funding for restocking.  Isnt that silly?  They do, but the Atlantic restoration program is also supported by corporate donations.  It is unlikely that those funds would be available to promote non-native species if the MNR were to give up on Atlantics.  There is also no guarantee that the MNR would re-allocate their own funding and efforts to bows and browns if and when the Atlantic program is halted.  I am not convinced that ending the Atlantic program will benefit other species."

I wouldn't recommend holding yor breath while you wait for an increase in stocking other species should the Atlantic program ever cancelled."
937384,manitoubass2,2015-09-30 15:31:00,11391,Well to be honest it doesnt effect me. Im nowhere near lake O or tribs that have trout/salmon.  I live in NW ontario  But its still pisses me off that the money is essentially being wasted
937389,solopaddler,2015-09-30 15:44:00,8605,"An interesting and well thought out response from Darryl Choronzey on the topic. What I took away from it was stream temps are too high when the salmon return and perhaps just as importantly they are not imprinting because of where they are stocked and the strains of fish being dumped in:   The Ontario Atlantic Salmon Program Ignorance or StupidityThe Province of Ontario has been stocking Atlantic Salmon in an attempt to achieve self-sustaining reproduction not just since the spring of 1986, but as early as the late 1800’s.  Tens of millions of Atlantic salmon have been stocked in their various life stages from eyed eggs, fry, fingerling, yearling, advanced yearlings and even full aged adults. The results can best be described with words such as disappointing, dismal and even disastrous. Year after year after year taxpayer dollars have funded an experiment that has shown no evidence of even minimal success. That is unless you perceive less than two dozen fish returning to a major waterway such as the Credit River west of Toronto, where millions of Atlantics have been stocked as a success.Atlantic salmon disappeared from the Lake Ontario tributaries in the late 1880’s due to river degradation in the form of dams, pollution, clearing of surrounding forests and to some extent over-harvesting.  Those rivers that could not support Atlantics in the 1880’s are in worse shape today than they when those last Atlantics disappeared before the turn of the century. It’s called population sprawl and urbanization expansion and those big Lake Ontario tributaries especially west of Toronto will never support Atlantic salmon restoration. Not now and not in the future. The Atlantic salmon is not a rainbow trout, Chinook salmon or brown trout. It returns to its natal stream at a different time and demands the best water conditions that the main rivers in this experiment can never provide.Roger Greil the smartest and the best and they never called him???Roger Greil the aquatic manager at Lake Superior State University is the only fish culturist to achieve any real form of success breeding Atlantic salmon in the Great Lakes and creating a sport fishery. Greil bases his success on three distinct reasons.-imprinting   His eggs are fertilized, hatched and all fish raised and released at one site on the St. Mary’s River for maximum imprinting.- stocking size  All Atlantics released at the university’s lab are held from 18-20 months again not only for maximum size and maximum survival, but maximum imprinting.-location (temperature)   The waters flowing down the St Mary’s River are perfect for this type of experiment. Always cold, always clean, always moving.Roger knows more about the needs, methods and problems faced with raising Atlantics in the Great Lakes than anyone. He also readily admits that he has achieved some degree of success, but he has special circumstances present at his site not found anywhere else on the Great Lakes. He also notes that he is not utilizing Atlantic salmon to create a sport fishery first, but as a study animal in his classroom. Atlantics are difficult to rear and are not a creature to expect optimum survival either in the hatchery or once released in the wild.Roger also mentioned time and time again the fact that Atlantic salmon were adversely affected by a diet of alewife when feeding in the Great Lakes. Like most salmonids, but particularly true with Atlantics eating alewife led to thyamine deficiency, which in turn related in very poor survival from egg to fry when the fish were hatching. In fact, when alewife were the main source of food for Atlantics in Lake Huron he suffered losses from 80 to almost 100 percent. In the wild this related to almost no chance of spawning success.The Early Years- Atlantic salmon restoration has been attempted since the very first signs of their possible extinction in Lake Ontario back in the 1880’s. Samuel Wilmot first began stocking Atlantic salmon back in 1865. Since then millions upon millions of Atlantics have been stocked in rivers such as Bronte, the Credit, Duffins Creek, Bowmanville, the Humber, Moira, Lynne Creek, Salmon, the Wilmot …just about every tributary on Ontario’s north shore. Has natural reproducing self-sustaining population ever been established after more than 125 years of effort?1987 - 2004 From 1987 to 2004 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources embarked on a major program to once again attempt to develop a natural reproducing self-sustaining Atlantic salmon population. It proved to be another failure.Often the OMNR will attempt to explain the reason for the failure noting that adequate numbers of Atlantics were not utilized. At times they note that stocked fish were possibly too small when stocked to meet their target. The answer is simply no. Over almost a 20-year period more than 2,463,000 Atlantics were stocked. Yes, 124,920 were eyed eggs, but more than 2,200,000 were live fish ranging from fry, through to yearlings, right through to adult age classes. The fish just didn’t survive in any real numbers. In an attempt to identify any type of survival the Ministry of Natural Resources even carried out a special ‘fishing survey program’ whereby certain anglers were allowed to carry special permits to fish closed waters in an attempt to locate any surviving adults.The Atlantic catch results as expected proved to be dismal, but it certainly provided some great angling opportunities for those special fishermen allowed to angle in waters closed to everyone else in the province when it came to rainbow and brown trout, but few if any Atlantics were caught.

Sure there were a lot of fry and fingerlings being stocked yearling and advanced yearlings being stocked as well. Millions of fish being raised and stocked and nothing coming back.Now go back again and look at why Griel was getting results. Imprinting , stocking size, location/temperature. This just wasn’t happening in Ontario and it still isn’t. Greil’s fish again are hatched, raised and released at the same location for perfect imprinting. Greil carried all his fish over to advanced yearlings 18-20 months of age. His location on the St. Mary’s is cold and comfortable year round.At the time of this experiment, I was raising rainbow and Chinook in Owen Sound and visiting Burlington a lot. I also happened to have a high/low thermometer with me in the truck for numerous years. Many times I stopped to take water temperature upstream of the Queen Elizabeth at both Bronte Creek and the Credit. During July and August temperatures were more often than not in the low to mid 80’s. Not only lethal but chowder cooking time for any Atlantics that ever did survive and decide to try and enter the rivers. Rivers west of Toronto just don’t cut it and that was being proven. I also got similar high temperatures at Duffins and even Bowmanville during the summer months.Again, as far as I’m concerned these rivers for the most part are great rainbow rivers, but rainbow for the most part enter the tribs from late September around til late April. Atlantics are a different critter with a different date book.  Summer temperatures are lethal on these fish. These rivers are not what they used to be and never will be.Not once in those 8 years did the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources attempt to contact Roger Greil to discover why he was succeeding and they were failing.MNR/OFAH Buddy UpIn late 2005 or early 2006 I received a phone call from a good friend of mine ‘at the time’ named Jerry Smitka. Smitka was a retiring Ministry of Natural Resources biologist and along with Jack Imhoff another biologist was promoting a new venture being conjured up between the Ministry of Natural Resouces and the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters concerning the Atlantic salmon. Jerry asked if I would support it. There was talk of old mounts on the poolroom wall. DNA samples from long extinct Lake Ontario Atlantics and even possible excursions to South America planned to possibly bring back some original genetic stock. He also asked if I would support the program?My reply was simple. No thanks. Still it was the same critter, possibly with a few genetic changes, faced with the same problems. Same old stocking practices and in my opinion the same old results would be achieved.  It was and still is my opinion that the rivers and Lake Ontario would not support a viable Atlantic salmon sport fishery and would not support natural self-sustaining reproduction.Over the years there would be plenty of hype by both parties. Plenty of photo shoots with politicians that knew very little about the fish that they were carrying down to the river for the cameras. There also was plenty of talk of planting trees, turning stones in rivers and getting kids involved. There were even press releases in the early days of the program from the parties involved about the number of fish that had been stocked by the partnership.I’ve yet to see a press release on the number of Atlantics that returned to the river. The surviving fish just never materialized in any numbers to the river or to the fishermen, in the lake or the river.The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and their associate experimenters also at times again passed out the permits to ‘distinct’ angling individuals to fish during the closed seasons and in sanctuaries in an attempt to find these Atlantics. These seek and search privileged angling trips were suspended under the protests of the public.Back about three years ago, I was exchanging Christmas greetings with a friend of mine, Chris Goddard the Executive Secretary of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission. As usual, the subject got around to Atlantics. Only this time Chris suggested I sit down with Mike Morencie Ontario’s new Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife supervisor.The first of a number of meetings was arranged and I flew up from Florida to meet the new head of fish and wildlife.  He knew in advance that I was concerned and had been adamantly against the Atlantic program from the start.At the first meeting, I suggested that at least half the scientists involved and responsible for the program should be fired or shipped out.  I also noted that the smart move would be to immediately flush every Atlantic salmon being held in ministry hatcheries at the time down the toilet, explaining that he would achieve the same results….almost zero, but save the cost of rearing, babysitting and feeding the beast.I noted that only Greil at the Soo had achieved any real success due to the all important factors of genetics, proper size at release, proper stocking, proper imprinting and the fact that the Sault Rapids have that all important ‘cold’ water factor come home in June/July and August the time when Atlantics first return to his hatchery and their release site. He also listened to my concerns on thyamine deficiency due to a diet of alwife in Lake Ontario. I strongly suggested that his staff contact the one person that knew more about Atlantic salmon than anyone in the Great Lakes…Roger Greil. Surprisingly, up until this time that I write this report, no one in the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has ever made contact with Greil.In a follow-up phone conversation I asked for the latest Atlantic return figures for the Credit River. I was given a new contact name to receive the numbers. Low and behold when I made the call I was informed I would have to wait the like rest of the press and would get the numbers in March when the release was made public. Was this Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources co-operation at it’s finest???I immediately hung up the phone and called Mike Morencie who promised the results in a day or two. I honestly expected low return numbers of a hundred or more. To say I was shocked at what really returned to the Streetsville dam is putting it mildly. A grand total of 33 Atlantics had been captured in 2011 at the Streetsville dam. Millions of fish stocked in more than 25 years and 33 Atlantics were all that could come back to their major stocking river.But the story only gets worse.More one on one meetings were held with Mike. At times, even Doctor Chris Goddard sat in. Mike was more than co-operative. We discussed a lot of issues relating to the Atlantic program.  At one sit down, the thyamine subject was brought up. Mike mentioned tests had been done and Chris immediately noted that test that had been carried out were in fact not effective for testing for the problem???  Again, I noted that no one up until this particular meeting and even today had bothered to contact Roger Greil on the problems and cures related to raising Atlantic salmon in the Great Lakes.NormandaleThese days, most of the public believes that Normandale Hatchery is ‘the’ home of the Ontario Atlantic salmon program. That belief is wrong.  It’s just one of the homes. The problem is Normadale has been renovated mostly for Atlantic salmon, with a smaller portion allotted to raising rainbow trout and chinook salmon.Annually production of Normandale Atlantic Salmon-400,000 4-5 inch fry                     150,000   10-11 month yearlings                       75,000 advanced yearlings                     Total Atlantics 650,000Again, I requested and received the annual costs to operate Normandale. The reply from the Ministry was prompt and not surprising. Normandale’s annual operating cost has been established at  $386,500. I’ve been raising trout and salmon for more than twenty years. With the various species, sizes, numbers and hatchery space allotment I estimate the cost of raising the Normandale Atlantics at a minimum of $300,000 of the total operating costs of the Normandale facility.The Normandale fish are all destined directly for Lake Ontario tributary stocking by the Ontario government. This being established, I asked the numbers and costs of Atlantics being raised for the so-called other groups such as the OFAH, Sir Sanford Fleming, Metro East Angler’s Ringwood Hatchery, etc?Wow! Did I get a surprise?Harwood Fish HatcheryHarwood is one of, if not the largest of Ontario’s brood stock factories. Unlike our American neighbours around the Great Lakes who utilize wild fish stocks when collecting eggs for their fisheries programs, Ontario for the most part depends on large numbers of adult brood stock for the hatchery egg needs. It’s also Harwood that is the major Atlantic salmon source of eggs, fry and fingerlings for most of their experimental Atlantic salmon needs.Again, I requested from the MNR the number of fish produced, number of brood retained and the annual cost of the Harwood hatchery. Again, Mike Morencie and Kevin Loftus the Manager of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Fish Culture produced the requested records.The first report I received was frightening. Here’s a chart from the Harwood facility that has absolutely nothing to do with Ringwood for the fiscal year 12/13. It’s just one year mind you, but Harwood has been the eggs source for the Atlantic program almost from its inception.Harwood egg/fry/fingerling/yearling output… from fall 2012 spawnBelfountain                    27,562 fry/fingerlingsBelfountain                    31,176 eyed eggsCredit River                   63,162 eyed eggs Credit RiverSir Sanford Fleming        59,395 fry/fingerlingsOntario Streams          10,838 eyed eggsOntario Streams           14,269 eyed eggsSir Sanford Fleming    74,000 frySir Sanford Fleming    27,960 spring yearlingsSir Sanford Fleming   43,607 fryRingwood                    25,291   fry/fingerlingIslington                       46,734 fryHumber             57,881 eyed eggsBronte              37,117 eyed eggsCobourg Creek   38,476 eyed eggsOFAH classroom           9,950 fryCoderington Research  35,345 green eggsTotal….    602,759You have to remember that a number of these destinations, besides Ringwood, Sir Sanford Fleming and the CRAA are also utilizing the actual fish and even eggs to raise Atlantics. These volunteer clubs end up picking up most of the funding to carry the fish over to fall fingerlings. One also has to realize again, that all Atlantic eggs and fish produced at both facilities require brood stock. Atlantic salmon have always proven to be a tough fish to raise in the hatchery, starting with the fertilization of the egg. That was the reason for my request for the number of Atlantic brood stock being kept at Harwood.When the answer came, I was again more than surprised. The number of Atlantic brood stock in Harwood consists of 3 strains, 14- year classes, which totals out at 4,544 brood stock. The ministry also noted at the same time that over at Normandale an additional 2 strains, 7 year classes which totaled at another 3,355 Atlantic  brood stock.  I would say 7,899 Atlantic broodstock are a lot of hungry mouths to feed for 365 days a year.Harwood’s annual operating costs were given to me at $422,835 for that year.Total Atlantic Salmon Stocked Produced at Harwood 2005-2012Anyways, put the total of the fish raised and released at Ringwood and Harwood Hatcheries for this experiment since 2005 and 2012 and you have astronomical 4,413,858 fish and an additional 1,924,178  eyed eggs stocked as well.Total Atlantic Salmon Stocked From 1987-2012Now add those numbers together with those stocked between 1987/2004 and we now have a total of at least 6,742,000 fish and at least a minimum of 317,000 eyed eggs stocked in Lake Ontario’s north shore tributaries since the start of this idiotic program.  (all figures provided by Great Lakes Fishing Stocking Data Base) http://www.glfc.org/fishstocking/rangesearch.htm)The Credit Pitiful Returns Should Be Looked On As No ReturnsSo where are the fish? Right from the start of this program the Atlantics have failed to survive, failed to return in any numbers to their release sites, and even failed to provide any resemblance of what could be referred to as a sport fishery.The Credit River system by far receives the largest annual stocking of Atlantic Salmon and has been the focal point of stocking efforts. In the past, the Credit has been ‘the’ river to experiment and it’s only getting worse! In 2011 more than 390,000 Atlantics were stocked, along with 144,000 eyed eggs. In 2012 the Credit received 567,919 fish and additional 439,000 eyed eggs. A simple word for this travesty…asinine!What returns have come back to the Credit?              -In 2011  33 adult salmon returned to the first barrier at Streetsville              -In 2012   20 adult salmon returned to the first barrier at Streetsville              - In 2013  9 adult salmon returned to the first barrier at StreetsvilleMillions upon millions of fish stocked and 9 Atlantic Salmon come home to the Major Atlantic stocking site in Ontario!This is one of 4 Atlantics that came back to Bowmanville...it looked at the dam and died in the net before releaseAt Bowmanville Creek, more than 11,000 chinook , coho and rainbow trout were hand lifted over the Bowmanville dam by volunteers. Out of that number only 4 Atlantics were found. The All New Oregon Weir To Count Atlantics At Duffins CreekAnd let’s not forget the much touted Oregon fish weir shipped from the west at a cost of $200,000 or more.Well, the high money contraption was erected and low and behold the sum total as of this November was a total of 7 Atlantic adults at the costly imported construction. Funny, but worrisome is the fact that I contacted the biologist at the Toronto Conservation Authority before the weir was delivered and inquired what his high water temperature levels were in the river close to Lake Ontario and he noted often as high as 85 degrees Fahrenheit…….duh that’s better referred to as Campbell soup water when it  comes to Atlantic salmon.Wrong Rivers / Wrong Techiques:Now look back at what I said about Roger Greil and his reasons for success at Sault Ste. Marie on the American side at his university. He raises the right fish, to the correct size, imprints them perfectly and releases them at the same location. Ontario has not met this criteria at any of their locations.  Roger raises, rears and releases his fish under perfect conditions. His fish are hatched, raised and released at just one site. That achieves perfect imprinting. His fish are also raised to approximately 20 months of age for optimum survival. When his surviving adults do come home they are greeted by perfectly cold water conditions due to the fact that Lake Superior empties in to the Soo Rapids at his home base. Again, Ontario is not able to replicate this at any of their sites. Ontario’s Atlantic salmon are reared at Normandale and Harwood or hatcheries at Ringwood, the CRAA hatchery, Sir Sanford Fleming or a few school hatcheries. The Atlantic yearling plus fish that go into Ontario streams for the most part are imprinted to those hatcheries. The fish raised by volunteer clubs are not reared to proper smolting age of 20 months but as fall fingerlings. In his years of study, Greil found no returns or pitiful returns from anything but yearling plus Atlantics and again they were imprinted from birth at the one release site.Just as important is the cold water factor at the Soo Rapids. This is not the case on any of the large Ontario rivers like the Bronte, Credit, Duffins or others. Atlantic salmon return to the river as pre-spawning adults in June, July and August. Those Ontario rivers are at lethal temperatures at that time of the year. Fish chowder is more the results than fish survival.With the Ontario program the vast majority of fish are stocked too young and too small for any long-term survival and then we dump them by the millions into rivers that are not receptive to the creatures.  The present rivers are no way as clean or as cold as they once were when the fish went extinct back around 1887. Dams are still evident on most rivers, forests have been cut and cleared, temperature has risen and for the most part urban sprawl has either polluted them or made them lose their much-needed high oxygen requirements.The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and their partner super-seed their river systems with far too many fish. Even if the young fish fail to survive long term, they will still decimate newly hatching upstream wild trout stocks that are hatching. You can only put so much water in a barrel or fish in a confined river or tributary. Millions upon millions of Atlantics have been stocked in the upper Credit and this does not help, but hinder hatching brown trout or brook trout and the fishery in that river. Common sense should have dictated smaller numbers when stocking, but common sense seems to be thrown out the window in an attempt to show some form of success for the program.Our American NeighboursAs already noted in my opinion Roger Greil at Lake Superior State University has shown the most significant success with Atlantic salmon survival and resulting  returns. Remember, his eggs are obtained at his site on the St. Mary’s River from returning wild stock. Those eggs are then hatched and the young fish retained at the same site until they reach smolting age 20 months later, when they are released at the same exact same site for maximum imprinting.The St. Mary’s River is without a doubt a perfect location for experimenting and producing an Atlantic fishery. The waters are cold, clear and well oxygenated from Lake Superior located upstream. It is the only site on the entire Great Lakes that allows for this degree of success for rearing and releasing Atlantic salmon. The fact also has to be made that the St. Mary’s River’s ‘bottleneck’ physical structure and conditions drastically improves the sport fishery. Roger releases only approximately 50,000 advanced yearlings annually.The State of Michigan experimented with Atlantic salmon in the past and cancelled their program for decades. Noting Greil’s success and to fill the void of their reduced Chinook fishery they are now experimenting on a ‘controlled’ Altantic program capped at approximately 100,000 Atlantic salmon ‘advanced’ yearlings per year. The majority of those plants will be stocked in the cold waters of the St. Mary’s River. Again, stocked in a perfect site, but without Greil’s imprinting success capabilities. Michgan State Atlantics are reared at the Platte River hatchery and then stocked in the St. Mary’s River. When questioned, Michigan authorities noted if they don’t achieve the desired results the program would be cancelled after no more than 6 to 7 years.New York State has been stocking Atlantics consistently for years and has had some success, but unlike Ontario, rears and releases the vast majority of their fish as advanced yearlings (15 months) and 8 to 10 month old advanced fall fingerlings. They seldom stock more than 60,000 fish annually in total and prefer to raise them to 14-16  months of age. It is important to remember that New York State utilizes the Salmon River including Beaverdam Brook for the largest percentage of their stocking numbers for imprinting purposes.Again, there is an Atlantic salmon sport fishery off New York State waters, but they stock minimal numbers of quality sized fish and imprint them properly utilizing the Salmon River where the greatest number of fish are stocked. It is interesting to note also that creel censuses and DNA sampling last year carried out by New York State indicated that all Atlantics caught by anglers were tested and came entirely from New York State stocked fish!!!All this accomplished with a fraction of the fish raised and a fraction of the costs compared to Ontario’s foolish Atlantic experiment!!!!Remember, our neighbouring American states raise fish for fishermen, for tourists and for the economy. Their programs are run as business, not as an experiment!!!False ImpressionsOver the past decade that I’ve been than following the Atlantic program. A lot of phone calls from Wisconsin to Newfoundland. I’ve talked and met with a lot of top fisheries people on both sides of the border. Not surprising, not one on the American side of the Great Lakes had any idea of the actual dismal success of the Ontario program. In fact, most believed the program and returns were going great guns. It seems no one on our side of Lake Ontario ever mentions the dismal returns to the Credit or Duffins or even Bowmanville. I sat in on one Lake Ontario meeting and listened to Ontario reps talk about the ‘new’ Duffins Creek weir being shipped from west coast, yet absolutely no mention of the dismal Atlantic Credit returns of 2011 and 2012.One boss at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service even noted they were thinking about putting smaller Atlantics in some of their streams to achieve the same success as Ontario. What he had heard was the fry plants were doing great guns?When I mentioned the true returns he replied with the phrase “someone over at the MNR must have a nose that’s growing”.That nose is definitely growing, but if you check stocking sheets, the U.S. Federal agency since 2009 has been stocking tens of thousands of additional fingerlings annually with little chance of success. Hopefully, our American counterparts are not venturing into the same folly as Ontario. Fingerlings or fall fingerlings just don't cut.When discussing Atlantics with the Credit River Conservation Authority, there was more concern about the vanishing brook trout than Atlantic salmon. I mentioned over stocking the waters above Norval, yet it seemed they were oblivious to the millions of Atlantics being stocked on top of the brown trout and brook trout in the Credit headwater that they were really concerned about.Never, since the start of this program have I ever talked to one person outside of the Ontario program who were informed of the actual returns rates. Plenty of talk about stocking numbers and so-called river enhancement, but never about returning fish numbers.On one other note, one Ontario biologist noted that in the mid-80’s it was brought up that that the original program should restrict their numbers to a maximum of only 50,000 yearling plus and only utilize two cold water rivers east of Toronto to attempt the experiment in the first place where the better conditions could be found. The suggestion was turned down and then the mistakes began.The Lake FisherySince the late 1980’s we’ve now stocked close to 7 million Atlantics and over 300,000 eyed eggs. Just what has that provided the Lake Ontario open water angler? The simple answer is very little recreational benefits and very little return to the economy. In both cases, almost nothing. As already noted, New York, utilizing bigger sized smolts and better imprinting practices has developed a minor sport fishery. On the Canadian side of the lake the results have been dismal.  Ontario’s most recognized fishing guides Randy Scott and Wayne Andrew’s are pioneers on the lake and have been guiding on Lake Ontario consistently for more than four decades. This past year from May until mid-September the longtime guides captured only two Atlantics each, while harvesting upwards of a thousand steelhead and Pacific salmon each. When it comes Atlantics the results were worse than pathetic. These professionals fish almost every day of the week from spring until early autumn and again caught a grand total of only four Atlantics.The open water fishery for Atlantics is a bust.The AlternativesLike, I’ve already noted, I’ve been following the Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon program since it’s inception in the late 1980’s. The idea of self-sustaining natural reproducing Atlantic salmon on Lake Ontario’s north shore is asinine. Everything today is wrong for this creature.  No matter what anybody would like to believe the rivers waters are nowhere near the conditions of the late 1880’s when the original stocks went extinct. Atlantic salmon for the most part return to the rivers in June/July/ and August. Today, the major rivers to the west of Toronto reach lethal water temperatures in this period and would for the most part kill any Atlantics entering, let alone attract them to enter.The Credit River, the experiment’s main focus site, still has two major dams at Streetsville and Norval that are closed to other species. These dams not only stop natural migrations, but increase water temperatures to the lethal level. The same river has a number of water filtration plants on it’s banks. The river is not even close to the river of the 1880’s.As a matter of fact, no river on the northern shore is of better quality today, than the rivers of the 1880’s. Simply look at population growth and the pollution that goes with it. All the trees planted and rocks placed cannot bring these rivers back to their pristine state prior to the 1880’s. Sorry, but it’s impossible. The tributaries west of Toronto are the worst examples.The Atlantics are not a Pacific salmon or steelhead that run the rivers in fall, winter and spring depending specie. Atlantics first enter the tributaries in June, July and August and few if any of our rivers are cool enough for their survival today, especially the Bronte, Credit and Duffins Creek.Again, stocking Atlantic salmon younger and smaller than advanced yearlings at a minimum of 8 inches is length leads to nothing but  death of these fish.Why in hell’s name are we wasting value hatchery space, expensive funding, lost fishing opportunities and lost tourism dollars to the economy on this program?The obvious solution is to raise a maximum of no more than 50,000 advanced yearlings. Only two quality streams east of Toronto should be chosen as release sites that are more suited to beast. These two streams have to be east of Toronto for any type of success.With the Atlantic program reduced from over a million Atlantics annually, both Normandale and Harwood fish hatcheries could be utilized in a much more productive manner for not only the fishery but economy that goes with it hand in hand. The reduction would free up space and funding.Presently, thanks to a working arrangement between the Ontario Steelheaders, Lake Huron Fishing Club and the Ministry of Natural Resources 70,000 disease free Chambers Creek strain steelhead are being held at the Chatsworth facility. A portion of these steelhead (1,000) should be implemented into the MNR brood rearing program. Future yearling trout from these strain could be stocked in larger numbers in tributaries on Lake Ontario and Lake Huron. Rainbow trout are a proven species that survive, provide year round fishing in both the open water and streams. A minimum of 100,000 could take up some of the hatchery space that would be made available with the removal or reduction on present Altlantic stockings.Ontario would also be wise to also re-introduce the annual stocking of approximately 50,000 – 60,000 coho salmon ‘smolt’ that could utilize the additional space made available by the ‘intelligent’ decision to drastically curtail the present Atlantic program.There’s more waste with the present Atlantic program than just what is happening in Provincial run facilities. Take into account the fact that more than 100,000 Atlantic salmon are presently being raised at facilities at Ringwood, Sir Sanford Fleming College and the CRAA operations. At the two volunteer run facilities alone,  with Atlantics out, the tanks now producing no viable results could be utilized again with additional rainbow (Ganaraska and Chambers Creek strain) and properly reared coho ‘spring smolt’. Check and you will discover that the Americans for the most part utilize larger advanced yearling ‘smolt’ for their stocking purposes and their over all success.Time For A Drastic ChangeAfter more than 26 years of playing and experimenting with this creature, it’s time to stop or drastically reduce the program. It’s time to run the fishery like our American neighbours do, not as a grand experiment, but as a fishery for the angler and as a business to generate tourism dollars back into the economy.As a fisherman, I look at stocking almost 7 million Atlantic salmon and stocking almost 2 million eyed eggs over the last 26 years and then getting a return of 9 Atlantics salmon back to Streetsville in 2013 as idiotic.Everyone talks about the Liberal’s billion dollar Gas Plant Fiasco. As a fisherman, I look at the Atlantic Salmon experiment as a travesty. A travesty that I estimate we taxpayers have invested more than 5 million dollars to date and possibly a lot more. That doesn’t even include in my estimation the Sunshine salaries, research salaries and everything the MNR has tied in to this project that are connected with this experiment as well.  It's a lot of money for wasting more than two and half decades of hatchery space, wasted fishing opportunities , wasted tourism revenue, other wasted revenues that could have related to the a successful fishery  and finally no  fish."
937401,craigdritchie,2015-09-30 15:56:00,1586, There are corporate sponsors providing $$$ specifically for the Atlantic restoration program.  That - right there - is the entire problem with the Atlantic salmon program.  It no longer has anything to do with fish. It is 100% about keeping the money rolling in.
937412,Garnet,2015-09-30 16:52:00,2056,"Just one small point. The original funding was from Ontario Heritage Fund. MNR got the money and the work.  I did the original temp profile for Wilmot, Oshawa,Bowmanville Creeks. Only Wilmot was close to acceptable and only if they got to the upper reaches. Other people did the other creeks.  On the east coast rivers you are not aloud to use tinsel on your fly's, why!  Yes the whole Atlantic program should be scrapped.  I would really like a list of stream re hab projects complete for this Program."

937239,craigdritchie,2015-09-29 23:09:00,1586,"Hello,  Thanks to John Bacon for sharing the link above to our FB post, as there has been some incorrect information about the Atlantic Salmon program and its history previously posted in this thread, most notably that MNRF’s research from the 1980s to early 2000s showed the rivers were not suitable for Atlantic Salmon. In fact, the opposite was found and reported in a 2003 review of the program. This review is what lead to the launch of full scale restoration as the next step, and the report’s specific conclusion on the subject was:  ""Although limited resources have delayed progress relative to the schedule contained in the 1995 Atlantic salmon Restoration Plan, the program benchmarks specified for the first five years of the program have be met. Research since 1995 has demonstrated that stream habitats support survival of the early life-stages of Atlantic salmon and that mature adult Atlantic salmon return to streams to spawn. There remains uncertainty about the rate of adult returns and the success of spawning.""  The report’s second conclusion (of seven) was:  ""The Atlantic salmon restoration program is now at the point where research and rehabilitation objectives converge. This is due to the fact that the key outstanding research priority is to understand the rate at which mature adults will return to spawn in streams.""  The reference for these is: Greig, L., B. Ritchie, L. Carl and C. A. Lewis. 2003. Potential and Strategy for Restoration of Atlantic Salmon in Lake Ontario: A Workshop Report. Prepared by ESSA Technologies Ltd., Toronto, ON. Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Lake Ontario Management Unit. Peterborough, ON. 39 pp.  In 2014, a further science review of the program was held and a report prepared – available here: http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=24 – that again showed well-above-threshold survival of juvenile Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. There appears to be a bottleneck for the older life stages stocked (fall fingerlings and yearlings) in the pre-smolt phase, related to rearing practices, and this was addressed beginning in 2014 to increase the role the older life stages play in returns; to date the youngest fish we stock are producing almost all of the adults.  More information on the program and its four components is available in this FAQ: http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=101  Fish production and stocking is only ¼ of the program’s activities, to date the habitat component has completed 189 coldwater stream restoration projects on five watersheds and each year through the program partners over 25,000 students get lessons on Lake Ontario and its fishes. Fish production and stocking get the fish into the rivers; habitat restoration continues to improve and protect habitat for the fish; education and outreach generates an engaged community of stewards for the watersheds; and research and assessment looks to understand how Atlantic Salmon behave in the modern Lake Ontario basin and feeds information back to the fish production/stocking and habitat components. From the 2014 science review and a subsequent management workshop, an updated Atlantic Salmon restoration strategy for 2016-2021 is being finished this fall.  With regard to the history of the Chinook program, what we currently have is the third iteration of a Chinook program – they failed in the 1870s and over 1916-33, and they were eventually successful in part because by the 1970s there was an empty niche for them. Even as late as 1977 though they were considered to have generated “negligible returns” (MacCrimmon, H.R. 1977. Animal, man and change: alien and exotic wildlife of Ontario. McClelland and Stewart, Toronto, ON. 160 pp.). A history of Great Lakes salmon and trout species and stocking is here: http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/254320.pdf  Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout have also had erratic histories over the last century plus; last winter MNRF opened public consultations on an operational stocking plan for Lake Ontario and provided further histories and background here: http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTIzODk2&statusId=MTg2Mzcw&language=en  This, along with MNRF’s annual Lake Ontario reports ( http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/mgmt_unit/ ), also describes how Atlantic Salmon stocking is actually distributed and more information on the program. But it also discusses the problems with Lake Ontario’s Brown Trout fishery (the migratory/open water fish, not the upstream residents) and proposed two alternative stocking options to improve the fishery. In short, despite being the second most stocked species by weight (after Lake Trout), Brown Trout had catch rates barely above Atlantic Salmon. The proposed alternatives were to stock more heavily at fewer locations, or stock heavily in annually alternating locations.  False facts and a toxic atmosphere won’t help the west basin of Lake Ontario or the Credit River. Any mature discussion of opening the river up will have to address a number of issues, including how accepting anglers are going to be to reductions in Chinook stocking to balance an increase in natural reproduction. Any reduction may (or be likely to) have to exceed the Credit River’s current stocking allocation. Ontario and New York committed to a predator-prey balance in the 2013 Fish Community Objectives (http://www.ontario.ca/document/fish-community-objectives-lake-ontario ) – Obj. 2.4 is ""Maintain predator/prey balance - maintain abundance of top predators (stocked and wild) in balance with available prey fish"" and Obj. 2.1 is ""Maintain the Chinook Salmon fishery – maintain Chinook Salmon as the top offshore pelagic predator supporting trophy recreational lake and tributary fisheries through stocking, accounting for natural reproduction."" (emphasis mine)  That is under a status quo situation with alewife abundance, and we may not be in a status quo situation – the 2013 alewife year-class at least has failed ( http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/lou2014hilights.pdf ) and Chinook are currently feeding off the 2012 record year-class. The 2014 alewife year-class will be reported on next winter, and we won’t know about the 2015 year-class until next summer. But for now all we know is they are feeding off a capital that may not be generating any interest.  MNRF has heard the concerns of west basin anglers and is already undertaking one major change to the Chinook Salmon egg collection and stocking program to move some of the longer-staging naturalized fish to the west end of the lake: ""The naturalized wild populations of Chinook Salmon that have developed in the north shore tributaries of Lake Ontario seem to exhibit a broad range of run diversity with some fish staging early in mid-summer and others staging later on in the fall. Since the early 1980’s, the source for all hatchery-raised Chinook Salmon for stocking into Ontario waters has been from returning fish collected in the Credit River at Streetsville Dam in early October. In an effort to expand run diversity, the MNRF will initiate a project in 2015 to collect Chinook Salmon gametes from two sources: 1) the naturalized wild population in the Ganaraska River and 2) the traditional stocked population in the Credit River. Other naturalized populations may also be considered as a source in the future. Fish reared from eggs from both sources will be stocked equally in Bronte and the Credit Rivers starting in 2016. MNRF is planning to assess the results of this initiative to see if there is a significant difference between the two sources.""

OFAH responses to public consultations are available online at: https://www.ofah.org/fishing-hunting/fishing-fisheries/action/ and our specific response to the Lake Ontario stocking plan is here: http://www.ofah.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/OFAH-submission-on-Proposed-Stocking-Plan-for-Canadian-Waters_of-Lake-Ontario-EBR-012-3046.pdf  Yours in Conservation, Chris Robinson OFAH Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program Coordinator OFAH FMZ 20 West Advisory Council Alternate OFAH Credit River FMP Implementation Committee Member     Blah blah blah. None of this answers the fundamental question.  We stock about a half-million chinook into Lake Ontario each year. The lake is full of them. Going out and catching a dozen chinook a day is not unusual at all.  We also stock about a half-million Atlantics into Lake Ontario each year. Yet to this day, most anglers have still never even seen one.  If the Atlantic salmon program is such a rip roaring success, where are all these fish?"
937242,jeffw,2015-09-29 23:32:00,267,I've always wondered why they don't focus more on stocking specks they are also native fish but don't seem to get much attention. Everyone seems to forget that browns and bows are not native. Cheers jeff
937253,John Bacon,2015-09-29 23:54:00,3277," That is the single biggest amount of horse crap I've ever heard spewed from your mouth Chris. The single biggest!!  I'll allow you to ""clarify"" your words before I clearly show how stupid and wrong that statement is. And of course, if one of your statements are as stupid as that, we can all imagine how much more verbal diarrhea you must spew.  So, please clarify, or if not, I'll have some fun  :)  Re: ""Brown Trout had catch rates barely above Atlantic Salmon""  I don't have the stats handy but if remember correctly that is the information that the MNR provided during their public information sessions. Despite stocking effort of browns along the north shore of Lake Ontario, there are few reports of anglers catching browns.  That is why the MNR is reviewing the stocking program for browns; they are not currently getting much return for their efforts.  One proposal is to concentrate the stocking in a few locations so that they can create very good fisheries in specific locations rather than having a mediocer fishery along the entire northern shoreline.  I don't doubt that there are more brown trout than Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario.  However, the baot fisherman on the north shore of Lake Ontario are not reporting many catches for browns.  It is quite possible that the trollers along the north shore are reporting almost as many Atlantics as browns.  The MNR plans to survery more shore fisherman which may increase the numbers of browns reported.  I know that there are shore fisherman who target browns in the fall; few if any of them target Atlantics.  Reported catches may not reflect populations.  Most of the boats fisherman are targetting Chinooks or bows.  Browns just aren't in the same waters as those species.  Atlantics are more likley to occupy the same waters as the targetting fish which will skew the reported catches in their favour.  So it may very well be true that reported catches of browns were barely above those of Atlantics."
937257,landry,2015-09-30 00:08:00,1005,"That's just cherry picking data that suits the MNR's agenda. Anyone who river fishes knows that Browns are waaaay more plentiful and common than Atlantics. They just aren't showing up much in boats. The Niagara is loaded with Browns in the Fall. These ""scientists"" need to use common sense. Boat catches do not represent ALL of the brown trout. Take the blinders off."
937267,landry,2015-09-30 00:42:00,1005,"I don't even River fish anymore but this kinda stuff bugs me. The MNR should start to put more stock into what good River anglers, like Bill and Craig, have actually seen over thirty years. Anyone who's been around River fishing for a long time has a good pulse on run numbers, trends and realistic, worthwhile and common sense fisheries management."
937270,John Bacon,2015-09-30 00:46:00,3277,"That's just cherry picking data that suits the MNR's agenda. Anyone who river fishes knows that Browns are waaaay more plentiful and common than Atlantics.

Take the blinders off.  The MNR never claimed that the data represented the population in the lake.  The data represents reported catches.  The MNR is not trying to establish a self sustaining brown trout population in Lake Ontario.  Brown trout are stocked to create a fishery.  If few people are catching them, then the stocking is not providing returns for their efforts.  Regardless of whether the low catches are due to lack of angler effort, lack or angler success, or lack of fish population; the stocking efforts have not paid off in terms of angler success.  The MNR has aknowledged that their surveys have been skewed toward boat anglers over shore anglers and have plans to address this.  If the shore anglers reports good catches that will show benefits for the stocking efforts."
937274,Steve,2015-09-30 01:05:00,2075,"boat anglers catch hundreds and hundreds of brown trout yearly.  my boat catches in excess of 100 browns annually.  I have caught since 2004 to present WELL OVER 1000 browns.  In that time, I've caught 2 atlantics.  I've caught browns from Hamilton to Niagara River, and from Hamilton to Bronte.  I've had days with 20 plus browns. I've had double and triple headers of browns.  I've caught browns in Hamilton Harbour. I've caught browns in the Niagara River.  Hell, TALK TO ANYONE who fishes the Niagara river how hard it is to catch browns.  Even more so, TALK TO ANYONE who fishes Pt Dalhousie about how many browns are around.  This is the most stupid, asinine conversation I've ever had about Atlantics.  Browns can be caught in January, February, March, April and May, from a boat, WITH SUPER EASE!  If needed, just to show how stupid this conversation is, I'll put up a poll on here, and spoonpullers, asking BOAT ANGLERS have they caught more browns, or atlantics, in their boat to date.  This is just retarded.  I know other anglers who target browns like I do, and have a VERY EASY time catching browns in the months I mentioned above.  There is one fella on spoonpullers who I put onto browns two years ago, that had a 35 brown day last May out of Jordan Harbour...that is more than every Atlantic caught on lake ontario all year.Wow.  I swear I've heard it all now.  JohnBacon and Chris Robinson, why don't we go out together next spring, on my boat, and we'll catch more BROWNS in one MORNING than you both will catch Atlantics in your ENTIRE LIFE (out of lake ontario).

Neither one is being used to discredit the other.   In the case of brown trout, the MNR stocks browns for the purpose of providing a put and take fishery.  They are just trying to maximize the amount of taking for their efforts in putting.  The MNR surveys (for the north shore at least) have not indicated that there has been a lot of taking relative to the amount of putting that they have done.  They have acknowledged that their surveys were skewed towards boat anglers.  They plan to survey more shore anglers; that may change the results if a lot of browns are being caught from shore.   The current plan is not to reduce stocking of browns on the north shore.  However, they may concentrate the stocking of browns into few locations.  They would still stock the same number of fish; they would just put a large number of fish in three or four locations instead of smaller numbers of fish in a dozen or so locations.  The thought is that they may generate more interest if there are a few very good fishing spots instead of mediocre fishing across the entire north shore. "

I'm VERY WORRIED that the crap that Chris spews to his OFAH friends will include that browns aren't any more successful than Atlantics...as a way to justify reductions in Browns to put more effort into Atlantics.  That is not acceptable.  OFAH and the public tend to be lemmings...and folks like Chris, who speak well, can convince those who don't know any better.  Like yourself, who is suggesting the results from some random MNR study...instead of knowing what is ACTUALLY going on in the lake...which is successful brown trout fishing from Hamilton to Sandbanks.... Yes, you have to fish for them...meaning shallower, and not out deep with the Kings.....  BUT DON'T discount the success of the Brown Trout due to the lack of success of the Atlantic program.  I wouldn't sell my trolling gear if the KING salmon disappeared (which appears to be happening), but I WOULD if the Brown Trout disappeared...because they are the most fun fish to catch on Lake O.  Most folks catch and release their browns as they aren't the best eating, but they make for a wonderful shallow water fishery....so no, you don't see tons back at the dock.....which is a GOOD THING!"

Yes, you have to fish for them...meaning shallower, and not out deep with the Kings.....  BUT DON'T discount the success of the Brown Trout due to the lack of success of the Atlantic program.  I wouldn't sell my trolling gear if the KING salmon disappeared (which appears to be happening), but I WOULD if the Brown Trout disappeared...because they are the most fun fish to catch on Lake O.  Most folks catch and release their browns as they aren't the best eating, but they make for a wonderful shallow water fishery....so no, you don't see tons back at the dock.....which is a GOOD THING!  Again, I am just relaying information presented by the MNR.  You may want to contact the MNR about your success with browns.  According to them they are getting very few reports of anglers catching browns.  They use the surveys to make decisions; os if they are getting incorrect information they need to know.  It would be interesting to know when and how they did their surveys.  I would think that surveys in mid-summer would show lower catches for browns than surveys done in spring or fall.  Surveys results can certainly be skewed if they are not performed properly."
937294,Steve,2015-09-30 02:43:00,2075,who knows how they did their survey's...  probably had a bunch of pimple faced kids hanging out around a launch ramp at the promanade in the middle of the afternoon who couldn't tell the difference between a brown and an atlantic anyway...  and those are the folks who provide the statistics that the mnr base their decisions on.  (and we wonder why the lake is going to hell in a hand basket).
937297,Dozer,2015-09-30 02:48:00,896,Wow - its those pimple faced kids who grow up and do work on the very fish you like to catch.
937298,Steve,2015-09-30 02:52:00,2075,"well, hopefully they learn about the fish in Lake Ontario on their own, and not listen to fools like Chris who come up with ""statistics"" which are the furthest from the truth!!!  soon enough it'll be, ""because browns are barely more successful than atlantics, and atlantics are natural to the lake, we should switch our biomass stocking from browns to atlantics...after all, browns are only barely more successful....""  that is the crap that comes from the OFAH and the atlantic program."
937323,BillM,2015-09-30 12:18:00,17367,We've been plastered with 'statistics' for years..  People can't forget the 2 page replies from John can they?   Although all those replies and stats still haven't ended up with any sort of Atlantic fishery.  Dump the Atlantics and spend the $$$ on steelhead or browns.  Fishery would be insane within 5 years.
937335,Garnet,2015-09-30 13:15:00,2056,Lot's of browns caught off piers. Both Toronto Star and Oshawa This week Brown category's were won on Whitby and Oshawa pier.
937336,John Bacon,2015-09-30 13:24:00,3277,Dump the Atlantics and spend the $$$ on steelhead or browns.  That is not an option.  There are corporate sponsors providing $$$ specifically for the Atlantic restoration program.  That money would not be available for other species if the Atlantic program was scrapped.  I would not count on getting any addional stocking of other species if the Atlantic stocking program is ever dumped.  We might get more stocking of another species; but I wouldn't count on it.
937343,landry,2015-09-30 13:54:00,1005,JohnBacon - u r likely correct and that is sad. But the MNR and OFAH are responsible for selling this unattainable dream to these corporate sponsors. Now they need to redirect those sponsors towards a different goal.
937344,manitoubass2,2015-09-30 13:57:00,11391,I didnt realize that the MNR doesnt have their own funding for restocking.  Isnt that silly?

937349,leaf4,2015-09-30 14:07:00,2466,What would a corporation have to gain from stocking Atlantics? (I'm a complete outsider when it comes to all this lol)
937364,John Bacon,2015-09-30 14:43:00,3277,What would a corporation have to gain from stocking Atlantics? (I'm a complete outsider when it comes to all this lol)  Advertising and branding; the same as any other charitable donation.  Corporations like to be seen as good corporate citizens in hopes that it will lead to increases revenues.  Many companies put charitable donations under the advertising budget.    One client of mine made a point of supporting the charities that their customers supported.  This was a high end jewellery store that catered to rich clients.  They would donate to the same charities that their customers supported.
936696,John Bacon,2015-09-27 01:32:00,3277,"There have been three strains for Atlantics stocked in Lake Ontario.  The LeHavs have been stocked for about 30 years or so.  The Sebago and Lac St. Jean strains have only recently started to be stocked in Lake Ontario.  The LeHavs are domesticated inbreds and stocking them is complete waste of time.  It is still too early to tell how well the Sebago and Lac St. Jean strain will do in the lake.  I am not sure if any of them are old enought to return to the rivers yet.The servival rate of the new strains in the hatcheries has been much better than the LeHavs.  Only a small percentage of the LeHav eggs received by the hatchery actually survive long enough to ever be stocked.  Ringwood had the exact opposite experience with the Lac St. Jean strain of Atlantic salmon.  Only a small percentage of the Lac St. Jean fish died; the majority survived long enought to be stocked.  From what I hear, the Sebago strain is even better.  Over the next few years we should start to see if the new strains also have better survival in the wild."
936698,landry,2015-09-27 01:37:00,1005,Epic post Craig Richie. Nailed it. It is so obvious I can't believe there is any room for debate.
936730,solopaddler,2015-09-27 11:55:00,8605," Then why not just spend the money directly ON habitat rehabilitation, and stop wasting it on raising and stocking fish that only seem to exist on paper? There's no benefit to creating false expectations.    There will be even less money for any kind of fisheries management efforts when this one doesn't produce the results that have been promised. Corporate donors (like that Australian winery) won't appreciate being told they're ""bringing back the salmon"" when, in fact, there is virtually no chance of that ever really happening.    No offense, but I have been hearing that load of crap since they started stocking Atlantics in 1985. No, success doesn't happen overnight. But it shouldn't take 30 years either.  OMNR began stocking coho salmon into the Credit River (>100,000 fish) in spring 1968. By fall 1969, they had large runs (3,000+) in the Credit and Humber Rivers. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It tpook 18 months.  OMNR started stocking rainbows into the Ganaraska in large numbers (100,000 fish/yr) in the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, they had 10,000+ fish going over Corbett Dam each spring. By the early '80s, they were over 15,000 fish. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It took less than six years.  OMNR stocked their first chinook salmon into Bronte Creek in 1974 (100,000 fish). By 1978, Bronte Creek was choked with adult chinooks every fall. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It took three years to see large returns of jacks, and only another 12 months to see big returns of adults.    Consider it this way ...  If we began stocking 500,000 chinook/yr into the Credit River, within three to four years you will see enormous runs of adult chinook. No one doubts this for a second.  If we began stocking 500,000 rainbows/yr into any river, within 18 months you will see catchable fish and within three years you will have massive runs of fish. No one doubts this either.  If we stocked 500,000 browns (I wish!!) into the Credit or Humber, you would be walking on the things within two years.  Yet for years we have been stocking 500,000 Atlantics into the Credit every spring, and we have maybe 30 fish per year (and this year, apparently just two grilse) to show for it?  Look man, I am patient. But even I have my limits.   Hi Craig, agree with all of your comments. Just curious what your thoughts are on precisely why atlantics haven't caught on when every other salmonid stocked has? Is it really as simple as the incorrect strain of fish or is there a deeper underlying reason?  We should talk when you have a few minutes.  Cheers"
936753,craigdritchie,2015-09-27 14:55:00,1586,"No idea Mike, since most other programs have worked out just fine as you note. Does anyone here remember the kokanee program of the late 1960s and very early 1970s? MNR stocked kokanee (small landlocked sockeye salmon) into Georgian Bay streams. The fish survived, and for a few years GB rivers like the Beaver were full of little, bright red,12-inch sockeyes. That was around the same time they began experiementing with pink salmon in Hudson Bay tributaries ( !! ) ... which led to them accidentally getting into Lake Superior. They failed in Husdon's Bay, but as we all know, pink salmon have established a large, wild population in Superior that exists to this day.  JohnBacon is right in his comment that stocking the LeHav strain of Atlantic salmon is a complete waste of time. But that being the case, why has OMNR stuck with them for 30 years?? Heads should roll for that.  MNR knows full well that Atlantic salmon are no longer suited to survive in Lake Ontario tributaries. In the 1990s, MNR performed several years worth of detailed experiments aimed to determine survival rates for Atlantic salmon fry that were stocked in various eastern Lake Ontario tributary streams. The studies found three things.  1. Atlantic survival was basically zero in streams with lots of silt, and with wood as their primary form of cover (i.e. more than 90% of available habitat in Lake Ontario tributaries). 2. Atlantic salmon survival was basically zero in any habitats where rainbow trout were also present. 3. Even in ideal, rock and gravel habitats with no rainbow trout present, survival rates were still minimal due to severe predation.  The biologists determined that unlike rainbows, brook trout, brown trout and Pacific salmon, juvenile Atlantic salmon did not hide on the bottom of deep pools or under in-stream logs and undercut banks. Instead, they tended to sit right out in the open in shallow riffles, where they were subsequently eaten by virtually everything that lives in and along a creek - birds, other fish, water snakes, raccoons, you name it. Even in what the biologists considered to be ideal habitats, and where they did not face competition from rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon still amounted to little more than very expensive bird food.  This was all well documented by the late 1990s. So why is MNR still beating a dead horse? If it's a matter of stocking the wrong strain of fish, why would they not have made a change over 20 years ago when it was clear this one isn't working out?  Something smells.  Happy to talk with you any time, Mike. Give me a call on my cell at your convenience."

937003,John Bacon,2015-09-28 21:35:00,3277,In Atlantic Canada they run in early summer. I would have thought that Lake O salmon would do likewise.  Run times in salmonids can vary quite a bit within a species.  E.g. in some places there is a spring run or Chinooks; steelhead often spawn in the fall.  There are three strains of Altantics that have been stocked in Ontario.  The LeHavs have been hatchery bred for many generations may not run at the same times as their wild ancestors.  The Sebago and Lac St. Jean strains should be much closer to their wild ancestors.  I am not sure when the salmon run in those locations; but I would expect water temperatures to affect the times too.
937027,John Bacon,2015-09-28 23:38:00,3277,Here is some relevant info. 
937163,chris_robinson,2015-09-29 16:54:00,14,"Hello,Thanks to John Bacon for sharing the link above to our FB post, as there has been some incorrect information about the Atlantic Salmon program and its history previously posted in this thread, most notably that MNRF’s research from the 1980s to early 2000s showed the rivers were not suitable for Atlantic Salmon. In fact, the opposite was found and reported in a 2003 review of the program. This review is what lead to the launch of full scale restoration as the next step, and the report’s specific conclusion on the subject was:""Although limited resources have delayed progress relative to the schedule contained in the 1995 Atlantic salmon Restoration Plan, the program benchmarks specified for the first five years of the program have be met. Research since 1995 has demonstrated that stream habitats support survival of the early life-stages of Atlantic salmon and that mature adult Atlantic salmon return to streams to spawn. There remains uncertainty about the rate of adult returns and the success of spawning.""The report’s second conclusion (of seven) was:""The Atlantic salmon restoration program is now at the point where research and rehabilitation objectives converge. This is due to the fact that the key outstanding research priority is to understand the rate at which mature adults will return to spawn in streams.""The reference for these is: Greig, L., B. Ritchie, L. Carl and C. A. Lewis. 2003. Potential and Strategy for Restoration of Atlantic Salmon in Lake Ontario: A Workshop Report. Prepared by ESSA Technologies Ltd., Toronto, ON. Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Lake Ontario Management Unit. Peterborough, ON. 39 pp.In 2014, a further science review of the program was held and a report prepared – available here: http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=24 – that again showed well-above-threshold survival of juvenile Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. There appears to be a bottleneck for the older life stages stocked (fall fingerlings and yearlings) in the pre-smolt phase, related to rearing practices, and this was addressed beginning in 2014 to increase the role the older life stages play in returns; to date the youngest fish we stock are producing almost all of the adults. More information on the program and its four components is available in this FAQ: http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=101Fish production and stocking is only ¼ of the program’s activities, to date the habitat component has completed 189 coldwater stream restoration projects on five watersheds and each year through the program partners over 25,000 students get lessons on Lake Ontario and its fishes. Fish production and stocking get the fish into the rivers; habitat restoration continues to improve and protect habitat for the fish; education and outreach generates an engaged community of stewards for the watersheds; and research and assessment looks to understand how Atlantic Salmon behave in the modern Lake Ontario basin and feeds information back to the fish production/stocking and habitat components. From the 2014 science review and a subsequent management workshop, an updated Atlantic Salmon restoration strategy for 2016-2021 is being finished this fall.With regard to the history of the Chinook program, what we currently have is the third iteration of a Chinook program – they failed in the 1870s and over 1916-33, and they were eventually successful in part because by the 1970s there was an empty niche for them. Even as late as 1977 though they were considered to have generated “negligible returns” (MacCrimmon, H.R. 1977. Animal, man and change: alien and exotic wildlife of Ontario. McClelland and Stewart, Toronto, ON. 160 pp.). A history of Great Lakes salmon and trout species and stocking is here: http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/254320.pdfRainbow Trout and Brown Trout have also had erratic histories over the last century plus; last winter MNRF opened public consultations on an operational stocking plan for Lake Ontario and provided further histories and background here: http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTIzODk2&statusId=MTg2Mzcw&language=enThis, along with MNRF’s annual Lake Ontario reports ( http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/mgmt_unit/ ), also describes how Atlantic Salmon stocking is actually distributed and more information on the program. But it also discusses the problems with Lake Ontario’s Brown Trout fishery (the migratory/open water fish, not the upstream residents) and proposed two alternative stocking options to improve the fishery. In short, despite being the second most stocked species by weight (after Lake Trout), Brown Trout had catch rates barely above Atlantic Salmon. The proposed alternatives were to stock more heavily at fewer locations, or stock heavily in annually alternating locations. False facts and a toxic atmosphere won’t help the west basin of Lake Ontario or the Credit River. Any mature discussion of opening the river up will have to address a number of issues, including how accepting anglers are going to be to reductions in Chinook stocking to balance an increase in natural reproduction. Any reduction may (or be likely to) have to exceed the Credit River’s current stocking allocation. Ontario and New York committed to a predator-prey balance in the 2013 Fish Community Objectives (http://www.ontario.ca/document/fish-community-objectives-lake-ontario ) – Obj. 2.4 is ""Maintain predator/prey balance - maintain abundance of top predators (stocked and wild) in balance with available prey fish"" and Obj. 2.1 is ""Maintain the Chinook Salmon fishery – maintain Chinook Salmon as the top offshore pelagic predator supporting trophy recreational lake and tributary fisheries  through stocking, accounting for natural reproduction."" (emphasis mine)That is under a status quo situation with alewife abundance, and we may not be in a status quo situation – the 2013 alewife year-class at least has failed ( http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/lou2014hilights.pdf ) and Chinook are currently feeding off the 2012 record year-class. The 2014 alewife year-class will be reported on next winter, and we won’t know about the 2015 year-class until next summer. But for now all we know is they are feeding off a capital that may not be generating any interest. MNRF has heard the concerns of west basin anglers and is already undertaking one major change to the Chinook Salmon egg collection and stocking program to move some of the longer-staging naturalized fish to the west end of the lake:""The naturalized wild populations of Chinook Salmon that have developed in the north shore tributaries of Lake Ontario seem to exhibit a broad range of run diversity with some fish staging early in mid-summer and others staging later on in the fall. Since the early 1980’s, the source for all hatchery-raised Chinook Salmon for stocking into Ontario waters has been from returning fish collected in the Credit River at Streetsville Dam in early October. In an effort to expand run diversity, the MNRF will initiate a project in 2015 to collect Chinook Salmon gametes from two sources: 1) the naturalized wild population in the Ganaraska River and 2) the traditional stocked population in the Credit River. Other naturalized populations may also be considered as a source in the future. Fish reared from eggs from both sources will be stocked equally in Bronte and the Credit Rivers starting in 2016. MNRF is planning to assess the results of this initiative to see if there is a significant difference between the two sources.""

This was in 1980/81. I know this ,as I was there just walking the river fishing and there were guys putting them in. I asked what they were doing. it was new to me seeing this.  I have only caught a handfull of them out from the mouth of the Humber in the early 90,s and they were not very big.  Thats all I have to add to this.  Cant wait for the read Milo."

It feels like the MNR is desperately clinging on to an ideology or goal that is in fact a huge gamble of tax dollars. Hearing about this pipe dream for years has worn on me. Give it up - invest the same effort and money into steelhead, browns and salmon. I'm not saying we should just start dumping millions of salmonids into Lake O like some of our U.S. neighbours do. Continue to keep a close eye on alewive numbers and focus on maintaining a proper prey relationship. Let's start to place our bets on a horse that has actually won a race or two in the last thirty years."

There seems to be great runs of browns on the USA side and anglers from this side seem to flock to it.  Why is there not the same here? I can remember fishing the humber way back, and the brown numbers were great. I dont know what the numbers are like now, but you dont hear of guys saying the numbers are great on our side.  Yes I know ,many will not report it, but for some reason, the numbers are stupid crazy accross the boarder from what I read and heard.  I use to fish the four sisters during the winter months for browns during the 80,s and early 90,s. We caught , what I was told, a german strain of browns that were introduced by the american side. They were in great numbers then. Would of loved to fished it in the earlier years ."

Must have been waiting for us because he jump right on the Atlantic program and gave us brown trout stocking east of Rouge.  They put a group of MNR bio's and a rep from each club and toured eastern states and Provinces. One guy that went was a freak for picking up a copy of every study done.  I'm the only one that read all the reports. And it was very clear these are the stupidest fish known to man. Any flashy silver do dad will clear out any hole. And they are stocking into a major boat fisher that troll flashy spoons.  And another every clear point was they imprint to the river and to the hole that they were born in. And the MNR are still dumping them out of tankers by the thousands.  They should be stocking individual holes with 10-15 smolts.  That should be a make work project MNR would jump right on.

936187,Quinn,2015-09-24 02:02:00,6,"http://www.ipetition...he-credit-river  Please take 30 seconds to sign the petition to save the Credit River fishery, which is dwindling quickly. With no access to the river due to closed fish ladders, fish cant reach spawning water and with no reproduction, there will soon be no fish.  If you fish the river or the lake, it affects you one way or the other. And after all, its your tax dollars going to support a failing fisheries management plan, thanks to the MNR. Look east and every river is stacked with wild salmon because they have access to water in which they can reproduce, but not the Credit..  Thanks."
936196,joeybacala,2015-09-24 03:17:00,63,Really sad development. I fished that river for so many years growing up in Mississauga. Wonderful memories that I still share today with my kids today. I really hope the situation improves sooner rather than later.
936225,netminder,2015-09-24 12:48:00,514,"Personally, I believe pretty much all dams should be removed from our rivers. Especially the dozens if not hundreds that serve absolutely no purpose or have essentially been abandoned over the years. Look at the Rocky Saugeen River. SVCA did a study on it a couple years ago and concluded almost all the dams in their watershed were doing nothing but preventing fish from moving through the rivers and streams."
936227,BillM,2015-09-24 12:56:00,17367,"I like my resident brown fishery the way it is, not going to sign.  Let alone the amount of traffic certain fish in certain areas would bring."

936242,Quinn,2015-09-24 14:48:00,6,"While there is certainly a great Brown Trout fishery above Norval, allowing migratory fish over streetsville and opening up the river to Norval (which they don't have access to right now) will not affect the Browns above the norval dam. Salmon will never get over Norval plain and simple, but restricting the largest tributary on the north Shore of Lake Ontario to just Streetsville doesn't make much sense, and leaves 30km of river unused.  A little education on the matter would go a long way."
936312,Salmonidstalker,2015-09-24 19:10:00,265," X2 agreed, keep the gong show to the lower river  edit: please keep the dam on the Ganny as well You will eventually loose you're brown trout fishery.  The MNR will be lifting the no kill soon moving towards the Atlantics and Brook Trout only.  I feel like those that are against dam removal have very selfish motives and want to keep something for themselves.  Damnation was a great documentary, and has become a hot topic around the world."
936316,dave524,2015-09-24 19:40:00,4508,"The resident browns were there long before the special no kill, barbless regs and sure they will be there long after, if indeed there is a change in the regs. Yes remove the no kill, can't wait for an Atlantic on the smoker or a Unicorn"

Atlantic salmon ... yeah, there's a laugh. Stock a half-million each year so that 30 show up at the ladder.  Great program, let's go with it."

I agree.  The MNR and OFAH really dropped the ball on that project and I do not support it at this point in time.  However, my point is simply the MNR are now focusing on Brook Trout and Atlantics.  Unfortunately for anglers, whether upstream or down, it will affect everyone.  It will be a sad day when no migratories will be left to catch on the Credit; for the sake of a few fly fishermen and their stocked non-native brown trout."

936406,landry,2015-09-25 02:49:00,1005,"Our MNR are promoting a pipe dream. They are so in love with rebuilding truly native species that they have stopped working in a truly productive manner. $$$$ should be spent on improving what is working or what will likely work - not likely on Simcoe Muskie and definitely not Atlantic Salmon. Getting back to the original thread point - anadromous species should have access up to Norval on the Credit. To be honest, though not a popular opinion, I believe that the American strategy of planting a mother load of steelhead for a put and take fishery is a better investment for Lake Ontario than the approach our MNR has taken. A ton of hardcore ateelheaders would likely disagree even though many of those same guys head down to NY to enjoy their awesome runs - especially in the Lake Erie Steelhed Alley hayday."
936440,BillM,2015-09-25 12:57:00,17367,"I can see letting salmon and steelhead get to Norval, no issues with that.   Has anyone noticed that the fish can take care of themselves? (ie look at rivers without any sort of man made barriers)"
936448,Salmonidstalker,2015-09-25 13:33:00,265,"If you know the Credit intimately, there is very little spawning water below Norval.  Steelhead definitely would not stand a chance spawning there, its just too hot during the summer for fly/smolt survival.  Fish can 100% can take care of themselves; provided man does not interfere too much.  I would love to see more angling opportunities for everyone.  A quality run of Pacifics and migratory trout would benefit the river anglers, and create a fantastic Lake fishery.  And you can bet those resident browns would put on some serious weight and size gorging on smolts all year long."
936456,BillM,2015-09-25 13:44:00,17367,Those resident browns love eating Atlantic smolts
936463,dave524,2015-09-25 14:02:00,4508,"Can not Chinooks successfully spawn below, it is my understanding that they hatch and leave the rivers before the heat of the following summer ?"
936467,PUMP KNOWS,2015-09-25 14:13:00,937,I wish all the dams would be removed from all rivers
936479,Salmonidstalker,2015-09-25 15:17:00,265," And BillM, you're right. Browns love Atlantic smolts. Start tying up some Atlantic streamer patterns lol."
936529,craigdritchie,2015-09-25 19:05:00,1586," 30??  So far they've lifted 2 grilse above Streetsville in 2015...  I think the all-time record might be something like 51 fish going through the ladder, from stocking something like a half-million per year. Then it dropped to about 30-ish. And so far, you say only two this year? Sounds about right. Since they began stocking Atlantics into Lake Ontario in the mid-1980s, I can count the number I've caught on one hand. Just a fantastic return on investment.   Those resident browns love eating Atlantic smolts  LOL ...  given the survival rate, it seems like a lot of other things like eating them too. Atlantic salmon = very expensive fish food."
936556,sleepjigging,2015-09-25 21:57:00,207,"The Aim of the Atlantic program is habitat rehabilitation. Until that happens, there is no chance for them and most species. Let the habitats come back and then talk about stocking.  Unfortunately, without the stocking program, there is no money for habitat restoration. (Funding catch 22.)  We have to wait. Success is not going to happen overnight."
936613,landry,2015-09-26 14:16:00,1005,"Sleepjigging - I think u drank the cool aid. Just teasing you. We've waited long enough. They should move back to species that have shown a good rate of return like steelhead, lakers and coho IMO. Yes the lake guys love chinooks so that is fine too cause, other than the last couple years, it has proven effective. There is still a huge alewive population in Lake O so I believe these species will continue to thrive. Improving stream habitat and removing barriers is always a great idea though. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Btw - I don't even river fish anymore but I was hardcore from age 17-35. Got sick of the crowds and big egos. Bought a boat. Never looked back."
936673,mpagnan,2015-09-26 21:45:00,84,All I can add to this is the sadness seeing all these rivers ankle deep most of the fishing season.
936677,craigdritchie,2015-09-26 22:03:00,1586,"The Aim of the Atlantic program is habitat rehabilitation.  Then why not just spend the money directly ON habitat rehabilitation, and stop wasting it on raising and stocking fish that only seem to exist on paper? There's no benefit to creating false expectations.    There will be even less money for any kind of fisheries management efforts when this one doesn't produce the results that have been promised. Corporate donors (like that Australian winery) won't appreciate being told they're ""bringing back the salmon"" when, in fact, there is virtually no chance of that ever really happening.   We have to wait. Success is not going to happen overnight.  No offense, but I have been hearing that load of crap since they started stocking Atlantics in 1985. No, success doesn't happen overnight. But it shouldn't take 30 years either.  OMNR began stocking coho salmon into the Credit River (>100,000 fish) in spring 1968. By fall 1969, they had large runs (3,000+) in the Credit and Humber Rivers. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It took 18 months.  OMNR started stocking rainbows into the Ganaraska in large numbers (100,000 fish/yr) in the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, they had 10,000+ fish going over Corbett Dam each spring. By the early '80s, they were over 15,000 fish. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It took less than six years.  OMNR stocked their first chinook salmon into Bronte Creek in 1974 (100,000 fish). By 1978, Bronte Creek was choked with adult chinooks every fall. That didn't take 30 years to see any results. It took three years to see large returns of jacks, and only another 12 months to see big returns of adults.    Consider it this way ...  If we began stocking 500,000 chinook/yr into the Credit River, within three to four years you will see enormous runs of adult chinook. No one doubts this for a second.  If we began stocking 500,000 rainbows/yr into any river, within 18 months you will see catchable fish and within three years you will have massive runs of fish. No one doubts this either.  If we stocked 500,000 browns (I wish!!) into the Credit or Humber, you would be walking on the things within two years.  Yet for years we have been stocking 500,000 Atlantics into the Credit every spring, and we have maybe 30 fish per year (and this year, apparently just two grilse) to show for it?  Look man, I am patient. But even I have my limits."
