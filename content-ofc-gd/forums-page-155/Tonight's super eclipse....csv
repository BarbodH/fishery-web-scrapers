936808,Gerritt,2015-09-27 20:49:00,6129,I'll leave this here for those interested. You can see it online if conditions are not favourable.  http://www.wired.com/2015/09/heres-watch-supermoon-eclipse-online/   Wonder if this will affect the fishing?  G
936832,Joey,2015-09-27 23:58:00,9122,Got my camera ready G.  Hopefully the cloud coverage will dissipate!
936839,ccmtcanada,2015-09-28 00:16:00,7971,Cloudy here too Joey.  Was looking forward to seeing it tonight!!
936843,spincast,2015-09-28 00:25:00,3279,"we just got clouded out, darn it. Had a beauty clear sky till the moon came up"
936844,fishing n autograph,2015-09-28 00:30:00,2540,Can't see it here in Vaughan
936845,ccmtcanada,2015-09-28 00:34:00,7971,Radar shows its clearing slowly from the west temporarily.  Fingers crossed in the next hour that happens.
936846,leaf4,2015-09-28 00:35:00,2466,"Can see it in binbrook, got my binoculars out the clarity is crazy, I can make out the craters on it"
936855,darsky,2015-09-28 01:50:00,586,crystal clear here in MTL-quite the show. Cant wait to see it red.
936859,Joey,2015-09-28 02:07:00,9122,Totally cloud coverage here I'm bummed
936865,ccmtcanada,2015-09-28 02:46:00,7971,Me too Joey....clouds just got thicker here.
936870,adolson,2015-09-28 03:12:00,783,"I could see it here, but it just looked like a slightly-orange moon during the actual eclipse.  Yesterday on the water a couple hours north of here, it looked gigantic and was out in the late afternoon."
936886,netminder,2015-09-28 13:13:00,514,As soon as it was due to start it clouded over at my place. Very disappointed.
936893,BillM,2015-09-28 13:25:00,17367,Got a few shots of it lastnight in between the clouds.  
936899,mr blizzard,2015-09-28 13:59:00,1589,"Nice Bill, too cloudy up here"
936905,Gallie,2015-09-28 14:50:00,1215,"I saw it till about 10:30 when it clouded over, pretty cool sight"
936918,Joey,2015-09-28 15:50:00,9122,"Nice shot Bill, better than what I got"
936920,netminder,2015-09-28 15:56:00,514,Got a few shots of it lastnight in between the clouds.   Beautiful shot. I'm tempted to use that as my desktop background

936939,lew,2015-09-28 17:11:00,12766,"Excellent picture Bill, really nice.  We had a good view of the 1st 30 minutes or so then the clouds moved in."
936956,Rich Clemens,2015-09-28 18:20:00,3131,Totally cloud coverage here I'm bummed  Same down here.  I knew I couldn;t see any part of it .... so off to bed I went.   guess I will have to wait for the next one   :-)
936960,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-28 18:33:00,8243,I like that pic Bill. It looks like one of those strange planets in the sky on an old Star Trek episode.
