The doctors/surgeons were very happy with the results  I want to from the bottom of ours hearts thank each and every one of u, between this and my back injury it has been a challenging few months but your words of kindness propel one forward  Thank you all Ketchenany Smokercrafty AlexW NewHips Old Man Steelheadphycho dave3 Woodenboater Manitoubass2 Lew DanD Dara Ohio Fisherman Old Ironmaker  thoughts are with u and yours today Big Cliff Mike Borger Brian B Stonefish Gallie Dave Roach Costa Moosebunk  thx I will get Mrs Blizz to read your comments in the next day or so she will be touched"
