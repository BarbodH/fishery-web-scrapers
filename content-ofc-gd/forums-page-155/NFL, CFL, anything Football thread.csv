936803,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-27 20:33:00,470,Now that's what I'm used to.  Last week Johnny Manziel leads the Browns to victory over Tennessee while Josh McCown recovers from a concussion.  This week McCown returns and bumps Manziel and we get schooled by the Raiders  Typical  GO BROWNS.    Piff!
936849,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-28 01:01:00,8243,The wize guys heads in Vegas must be exploding. no one knows who is going to cover who this year.
936875,Mister G,2015-09-28 09:31:00,1429,"Just when you think you've seen it all. The Rams Steelers game is delayed because the pyrotechnics when the players took the field caught the turf on fire. Pyrotechnics in a domed stadium, duh. Want to bet that today is the last time the NFL allows this. Ya Crazy Ship, eh."
936876,Mister G,2015-09-28 09:32:00,1429,Da Bills not only squished the fish but filleted it too.
936955,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-28 17:56:00,8243,"My head is still spinning from yesterdays marathon of pre game, games and recaps. My biggest surprise is how feeble Kapernak looks. The DC's have sure learned to play him since he burst into the league. Loosing Roman as his co-ordinator has really hurt him.  Buffalo is looking really solid and talk about depth. Watching them squish the fish was fun to see. I remember not too long ago when Buffalo got a first down it was a big deal.  Most impressive player yesterday was Atlanta's Devonta Freeman. 145 yards rushing, and knocking guys over like bowling pins. Most unimpressive, Colin Kapernick. I need to find how to spell that kids name.  Most impressive team, Buffalo, least impressive a tie San Fran and Chicago. The Bears punted on every offensive series throughout the game. A NFL record I think."
935503,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-21 01:50:00,8243,"Oh well, 1 and done. I can't do much with bragging rights anyway. Good luck all, I'll be watching. Down another 10 today too."
935508,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 01:56:00,11391,"Two birds with one stone???  Go figure, cleveland wins when they shoulda been blown out, and the ravens lose when they should have won???  Man I love the NFl!"
935537,Mister G,2015-09-21 11:15:00,1429,Well that was fun wasn't it..........lasted one week with our WINNER Steelheadphycho.......CONGRATULATIONS ! ! !
935545,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-21 12:57:00,470, Oh my......... LMAO!!!!
935559,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 13:25:00,11391,With the browns nonetheless!  Congrats dood!!!  Hahaha  You must be a football god if you win after week 2???
935591,Mister G,2015-09-21 15:41:00,1429,In my wifes pool at work they 'had' 215 people to start but after the Ravens and Saints lost this week it's down to only 35.......NEVER see a Survivor Pool drop so fast in all the years we have played it.  BTW it cost $10 to get in so someone will win $2150 in a few weeks.........nice non-taxed income IMHO
935592,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-21 15:43:00,470,??? is exactly right. I know as much about football as I know about open heart surgery ........ And I'm a filthy machinist!  Thank you Thank you very much Thank you! ???????!!
935593,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-21 15:45:00,470,Oh wait..... Was I supposed to send $$$?
935607,Mister G,2015-09-21 16:51:00,1429,"Oh wait..... Was I supposed to send $$$? YES, since you won you must send everyone else lots of money........"
935618,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-21 17:43:00,470, OK! The check is in the mail!

935747,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 04:01:00,8243,"Not good news out of Tiger Town today. Zack Collerus is going to be lost for the rest of this CFL season with a torn ACL. I am sad for Collarus, he's  good young QB and exciting to watch. At least he will have a chance to rehab this. It was a retirement slip not too many years back for an athlete if they tore that ligament. It holds the leg together at the knee and keeps the lower leg from moving forwards and backwards. Basically a dislocated or separated knee.  In this QB driven sport it comes down to what QB's are still playing well in November. The Cats won't make the playoffs I predict unless they trade for a bona fide thrower. Look for Kevin Glenn coming back to Hamilton in order to save this season. But who do they give up? 2 starters including a Canadian. Plus???? #16? Or they go south and find a QB. Tim Teebo was told when getting cut go to the CFL and get some reps in. Teebo time? I don't know if they can afford him, he won't play for 100K CDN. Then there's the tight CFL salary cap to consider so going south is unlikely."
935856,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 18:31:00,8243,"My guy Kiko Alonzo of the Eagles is out with a partial ACL tear as well. Not good for the kid. It looks like Buffalo was right and so far got the better deal, they questioned his durability. The talking heads are saying a guy like him that goes full out every play has a tendency to get injured, I get that."
935866,Mister G,2015-09-22 19:12:00,1429,"My guy Kiko Alonzo of the Eagles is out with a partial ACL tear as well. Not good for the kid. It looks like Buffalo was right and so far got the better deal, they questioned his durability. The talking heads are saying a guy like him that goes full out every play has a tendency to get injured, I get that. As I said he's too light to play the middle......too bad because he's a nice kid. I wish him well."
935874,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 19:51:00,8243,A torn ACL has nothing to with being heavy or too light. It happens especially knees but does help if you have legs like an Elephant but then they call you an O lineman. But you are right he is too lanky to play the inside Mr. G. I just like his pit-bull mentality. Can you imagine him at safety if he was faster? I hope he makes it back to Philly just in time to miss the playoffs.
935897,Mister G,2015-09-22 20:55:00,1429,I'm interested in what happens in Philly because of all the changes made by the great Chip Kelly.....he's probably a great guy but I'm sick and tired of hearing his name in every sports radio show on the dial.  Meanwhile in Buffalo the T-Rex got out coached everywhere but loose and twice last Sunday.  Maybe everyone over estimated da Bills because of the win against the Colts when you look at last nights game against the Jets da Bills might be the old Bills after all.  Could be another 9-7 season for da Bills with them just missing out of the playoffs AGAIN. What do you think ? ? ?
935910,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 21:58:00,8243,"G, man it's 2 games. You can't win the Super Bowl after 2 games and you can't lose it either. Remember when KC crushed the Patriots I think in game #2 last year. If I remember the Pats were 2-2 after 4 games. Too early to tell about anyone. Giving up a record 475 or some such ridiculous yardage is not good, granted. The Bills actually went up 1 spot in the power rankings on some site, what ever power rankings are. (I actually know but who cares). But 8 sacks, 110 yards in penalties, allowing 500 yards, not pretty. If you go back Buffalo out played NE in the 4th, but you need to play the other 3 too! Bills fans are blaming everything from the officiating to the Doug Fluttie curse in a loss. It's the defending SB champs you lost to not the Saskatoon Hilltops.  This is the first year I'm actually watching as a fan of Buffalo since those Super Bowl years. Time will tell. I like how NY looked last night especially with 2 rookie D linemen in the middle they played well. Revis and Cromartie on the corners, that's just not fair. It must be lonely out there. Fitz can hold his own, especially in Jeopardy."

Fitz can hold his own, especially in Jeopardy. I agree with a lot of things you have to say here and I think da Bills are going to be the most exciting since the Kelly years but they have a LONG way to go.  You can't be totted as the best defense in the league and play like last week.  The reason da Bills are more exciting this year is T-Rex........the reason da Bills will not make the playoffs is Doug Whaley  and the proofs is in the pudding. Look what this one man has now down to this team.  Acquire Doug Marrone to be da Bills head coach, trade away 2015 first round pick to Cleveland to move up in the draft to acquire Sammy Watkins and he hasn't come close to showing he deserved to be picked so high. Acquire McCoy when Marco Murry was out there. And what the heck is going on with trading for Matt Cassel, then waiving him, then signing him, then trading him for a less pick to Dallas. My God I feel sorry for that man.  Nope, they haven't proved in my eyes any better then 9-7 at best.......................But I could be wrong and that's all the fun in watching da NFL  . . . . ."
936295,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-24 18:30:00,8243,"Mr. G. When  I was in high school my favorite NFL team was the Browns but if I didn't cheer for Buffalo I didn't get supper. Jim Brown was reason #1. Plus our school football uniforms were identical to Cleveland's, home and away including the pumpkin heads. I learned that the original Principal of the school was a huge Browns fan in the 50""s but they called the teams The Glendale Bears, he tried Browns but was shut down, So of course my second team was Da Bears, it didn't hurt that Butkus was in the middle then. So I played RB and inside.  I think the lowly fans of Cleveland deserves better than the likes of Chip Kelly, I just don't like him, period. He reminds me of Dick Jauron, a deer caught in the headlights look to him. They must have a spinning wheel in the coaches office, who starts this week? Spin the wheel. OK Johnny Football, wait spin again.  If Ernie Davis could have continued to play Cleveland would have been unstoppable."
936378,Mister G,2015-09-25 00:10:00,1429,"OI, I loved your story about you not getting supper if you didn't cheer for da Browns......LOVE IT.......  I also played MLB in high school and my youngest son played it high school and college and then went onto coaching linebackers in college. He might have advance to the NFL but found a girlfriend/wife and the 12-16 hours per day of coaching were a bit too long for the small pay checks that colleges pay their assistance coaches. I don't blame him in the least.  But you lost me with Chip Kelly and da Browns................best I know Chip Kelly never had anything to do with the Cleveland Browns except for MAYBE a coaching interview."
936382,manitoubass2,2015-09-25 00:48:00,11391,OI is too old to remember???
936405,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-25 02:49:00,8243,"Too much sun today. I have to go back and check but I would have bet Kelly had something to do with Cleveland, Sorry, an oldtimers moment. edit: yep too much sun or Smirnoff's.  Great to hear your son had a shot at coaching at that level, 1 out of several 1000 at least. A former team mate and friend is coaching with Hamilton. He gave up a great paying job as a C.O. to coach at the University and pro level for 1/2 the salary then with a young family. He has a very understanding and supporting wife. He has dragged her and the family across the nation coaching at the University and pro level. I see him getting a head coaching gig soon, I hope."
936411,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-25 03:29:00,8243,I learn something ever day. Tom Cofflin head coach of the NY Giants just challenged a scoring play by the Washington Redskins. A scoring play is not challengable (new word). He looses a time out because he challenged it. With all the money these guys get on the coaching staff you would think someone would know ALL the rules besides the zebras.
936425,Mister G,2015-09-25 10:57:00,1429,"Some coaches and most players don't know all the rules.....If I punt to you and one of my team mates touches the ball in a attempt to down it but does not down it, you can pick it up and run AND fumble it to my team, it's still your ball. Think about that one as it's a rule in the NFL and college and high school. MOST coaches, players and fans don't know that. I learned that from my high school coach.  Baseball is even worse, where most coaches and players don't know MLB rules. Funny but true. I umpired for 8 years before giving it up because of bad knees."
936784,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-27 17:30:00,8243,"Just when you think you've seen it all.

935335,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 00:56:00,8243,"I didn't watch the game, I had to sneak out of the theatre to check the score. I hope to hell Collarus only has a strained knee and not a tear. This and the NFL are all QB driven leagues. NO QB, no chance.  Saw Black Sunday, 6 out of 10 because I know the story and it wasn't told that well. But Johnny Depp had a Oscar winning performance. I thought it was Whitey Bolger playing himself, eerie actually. Nothing about his victims, all about him and his punk ass."
935357,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 04:09:00,8243,"I'm wathching Ottawa/Sask game. Entertaining 27 all 36 seconds,. Hold on.......why a time out by Sask,,,,,,,29  secs left Ottawa chip shot to win. 22 seconds left. 3 points is good. Ottawa int. Win Ottawa away.  Watch out for these Red Blacks folks. They can be the real deal in the east. Heavens name what is that Rough Riders mascot supposed to be? A giant rat?  Calling Collarus' injury an ACL injury. Anterior Cruciate injury is not good. A strain 3 weeks a tear gone for 2015. I hate that no matter who it is. Years ago it was a career ending thing. No matter who your team is let's hope it's not a tear. Currenty ranked 1st in the league in every sat for QB's.  Would you have him come out of the locker room in street clothes, in his uniform or not at all? I say uniform, he can lead from the sidelines plus keep the opposition coach thinking.  Burris the old goat threw for 477 yards!!!! Not bad on the road, wait, fantastic man I love old guys doing well.  Burris just gave Collarus a get well soon call out, so did the Regina QB after the game, pure class."
935397,Mister G,2015-09-20 16:10:00,1429,Less then one hour to get your picks in.......so it's time to MAN UP ! ! !

935400,manitoubass2,2015-09-20 16:33:00,11391,Hahahaha  Ya never know man! Anything can happen in football
935402,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-20 16:38:00,470,Regardless what happens........ I'll be LAUGHING!!
935405,manitoubass2,2015-09-20 16:46:00,11391,???  Unless mariota breaks a leg hes gonna chew up your defence. Look for another 4 tds and about 160 yards rushing(at least) against your pick
935409,manitoubass2,2015-09-20 17:46:00,11391,Hahaha cleveland showed up to play!!!!  See
935412,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 17:52:00,8243,"I get up to make Tich a special coffee and NE starts there drive from the Bills 13 yard line. 14-7 NE. I am getting 5 different games today 6 if you include CFL. I am sitting on the deck as I brought the big screen out here. Look to my right and see a NG rig putting along while trying to watch 6 games not including the Jays. 23C and dry, sunny skies. I woke with no pain this AM after having a couple of shots in the hips earlier. Life is good man, really good. Brady knocking at the door again. That's not good."
935413,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 17:53:00,8243,"Another 7 off a turn over for NE, oh my oh my. It aint over till the fat lady sings. Too early."

935415,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-20 17:58:00,470,It ain't no where near over yet! They could lead all the way to the last minute then ........... FAIL!  Im a typical Browns fan......

935421,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-20 18:33:00,470,#11 Travis Benjamin. 78 yard return for td  Browns 21  Titans 00   LOL LOL!   No where near over!
935426,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 19:38:00,8243,"There have been several aliens that have been and are amongst us mortal humans, Michael Angelo, John Lennon, Elvis and Tom Brady. He is a great QB and I am tired of watching him beat the rest of mere mortals, not fair. Tyrod Taylor is showing his inexperience this afternoon. But what a gorgeous day. They are pulling Taylor for Matt Castle, why not EJ Manual. Oh he isn't dressed that's why, duh.  Aaron Williams off in an ambulance, not a good sign. I wish him well, he is a very passionate player and his 6 misconduct penalties show that, or a lack of discipline, that's on his coaches.  When do the Ravens play M2?  Down to the beach for a Hibachi Q as soon as this game is over. Life is good today and I appreciate it."
935435,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-20 20:07:00,470, So I got lucky this time........   LMAO!!!!!

A topwater with a wire leader on it, we don't have Pike here?????? Amateur neighbours I say, thanks for the 15 bucks in plugs and the wire leader. It has to be 5C warmer down there, coming up the rocks was like walking into AC. Nice. This day can't get any better, we are blessed.  edit: I'll let you know how blessed we are in a few months when the 100 KPH winds blow snow through the good quality hurricane rated patio doors.

I'll be back. No no no no...........you already picked  your team as you put them in ""quotations"".........so team ""Cut Throat"" is now your team this week.........good luck.....you're going to need it......LOL . . .

934891,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-17 19:40:00,8243,"Funny guy, ROTFLMAO, LOL and all those other little face dooeys.  As far as football does anyone think Jason Pierre-Paul's game will suffer due to the amputation of an index finger and the tip of another after playing with fireworks? He will be wearing a cast this week. I say yes, I lost the tip of a middle finger around 30 years ago and it still bothers me. I have to use my left hand to give that special finger now. He needs that finger to be able to grab, pull, push. The other thing is that he hasn't played a down this year. Practice is just that, there is nothing like the real game. I hope he proves his naysayers wrong though."
934896,Mister G,2015-09-17 20:11:00,1429,Well right now the Giants are not allowing him to play so who knows what will happen to Jason Pierre-Paul's game and he hasn't practice either. I believe the Giants don't want him doing any football stuff until he properly heals more.
934926,manitoubass2,2015-09-17 23:31:00,11391, Maybe its just a distorted view or picture? But if his thumb is as bad as it looks hes in trouble IMO
934937,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-18 00:15:00,8243,"Yea for some reason I was lead to believe he started on the field this week. Wrong, again. I saw his twitt or instagrama and man his thumb is gone, gone. Not good, what was he thinking? I know the Mara's would like to know that too. That has to affect his game."
934945,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 01:12:00,11391,No thumb is gonna effect him BIG TIME!!!

935030,Mister G,2015-09-18 16:24:00,1429,"And here I thought this was a CFL Football thread. NFL is not Football, ""girls game"" small field and they need 4 downs, and there ball looks like crap. And heck, they can't even make good Beer. Go Cats Go. And what was Stala doing chirping at the Cats Bench. He's lucky it was only a slight nudge. Still like to have him back playing for the Cats. Now let's get back to what this forum is about,( FISHING ) Here Kitty Kitty Kitty.......here Kitty Kitty Kitty.........  BANG Dead. . . . . shot by a Cowboy . . . . ."
935050,Fish Farmer,2015-09-18 18:36:00,2234,Here Kitty Kitty Kitty.......here Kitty Kitty Kitty.........  BANG Dead. . . . . shot by a Cowboy . . . . .  That's a good one. That's the only team that scares me.
935065,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-18 19:43:00,8243,I'll concur with M2B2 and take Baltimore this week. I'm watching the replay of last night game. I avoided the news all day  so I can see what happened. No I won't be looking here so you guys can spoiler me.
935074,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-18 20:00:00,8243,"That was fun. Kubiak needs to fired if he insists Manning stay under centre to set up the play action pass. As soon as they had to go to the shotgun down 14 Manning looked at home, pass first run second that's his game for his entire life. His wideouts dropped passes all night especially on the last drive. The win came on a lucky bounce. Hold on to that ball and protect it like a newborn especially when killing the clock. That's taught at 8 years old for C's sakes."
935086,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 20:24:00,11391,Well if we lose and the saints win thatll be the bunkest contest ever???
935095,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-18 20:38:00,8243,If that happens I don't have to keep track of who I picked.
935101,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 21:08:00,11391,Lol
935119,Mister G,2015-09-18 22:48:00,1429,Im still sticking with the ravens I think that's a solid pick as my wife picked that in the Survivor Pool at her work place.........errrrrr reporting place..

934397,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 01:06:00,8243,"Put the money on your family. You can not win anything betting. I have never been a big gambler but I know plenty that were and eventually lose it all, every penny. I'm talking 100K bets on a Sunday. M2B2, you say you went 3 for 5, not bad but, and a big but you risked money on 5 bets to be up by 1 only. I said I won't but I know I'll get another slip next Sunday. There goes another 10er."
934406,manitoubass2,2015-09-15 01:35:00,11391,"I spend 10 bucks a week OI and im up about 8 grand over the last 6 years lol.  Im not a betting man(casinos etc)  I just play my ticket each week and i quit around the 7th or 8th week when injuries begin and teams develope and it becomes to hard to pick easy winners.  This year ill admit i didnt study like i normally do so i might not bet at all, well see.  I usually study about a month out and honestly, if you dont get an ego bet, its easy money"
934430,Mister G,2015-09-15 10:06:00,1429,So much for my NFL betting 2015. Out 10 bucks and done.  I am watching the Philly/Atlanta Mon night game. I was a bit surprised when Buffalo traded Kiko Alonzo to Philly for McCoy. He just made a one handed int in the end zone. This kid is great. Watch for him. He has to stay healthy. Kiko is good but not great. He has the body of a strong safety and the speed of a middle linebacker. He's too light to stuff the run between the tackles. If you really watch him he does make a lot of tackles but they are always 5 yards down field. He's no Shane Conlan that's for sure.  Buffalo made a great trade to get McCoy who is one of the top three running backs in the NFL. Good middle linebackers are a dime a dozen in this league.  Chip Kelly will now sit and watch his system blow up in his face while the T-REX takes the Bills into the playoff for the first time in 15 years.
934433,Steve,2015-09-15 10:56:00,2075,My wife and I are part of a group of 6 TiCat season ticket holders.  I love going to CFL games.  I haven't watched an NFL game in a decade...likely even longer.  Just picked up 7 tickets to the Hamilton Bulldogs OHL home opener against the Generals.  Love supporting Hamilton Teams!
934489,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 16:36:00,8243,"Kiko Alonso has a body fat of less than 4%. He is almost 6'5"". He doesn't look like your typical NFL inside LB. Yes he looks like a big safety. His tenacity can not be coached or learned. He made that ridiculous 1 handed interception last night to prove my point. I like the guy and I agree he is no Connlon or Jim Hasslet, yet.  edit: allowing 150 rushing yards to 1 back doesn't help my argument though."

I like the guy and I agree he is no Connlon or Jim Hasslet, yet.  edit: allowing 150 rushing yards to 1 back doesn't help my argument though. Kiko is 6' 3"" and goes 238 which is light for a middle linebacker. All the good running backs carry him 2-4 yards down field. Chip Kelly was interested in him because he is also a former Duck and because Kelly and McCoy didn't see eye to eye.  Most non NFL linemen  have less then 4% body fat, nothing special there. And yes that was a nice interception he made last night.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kiko but don't think he's on his way to the hall of fame. Seems to have a level head, good work ethic and a gentleman to boot. But I think Buffalo got the better end of that deal......however, it was a win win for both teams."
934529,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 19:51:00,8243,"I hope Buffalo gets the better deal as well. I just like the guy right off the get go when I watched him in Oregon.  Is this Peyton Manning's last year. All the talking heads say he has a mechanical problem with his throwing. He must love playing or he owes, he owes so off to work he goes.  By the way G, I have never seen a  linemen with 4% body fat. If there is one I would like to know who, I'm sure I'll find out soon. 4% is 6 pack ripped."

934532,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 20:05:00,8243,"I just Googled the lineman question. There are some startling stats out there for NFL linemen as far as their risk to health based on their weight and career choice. The average linemen are between 21% and 24% body fat. The lowest being 16% and highest being 30%. Several studies showed basically the same numbers, 1 out of the U of  Ohio and stats from the 07' NFL combines for example. Your average ""skill position player is 12% body fat. BMI is not a good denominator as some may have dense muscle vs. height that skew the numbers .  4% is ripped. There are no linemen with 4% body fat, so there. Wait, maybe in high school because they are short linemen. I'm chuckling Mister B not being snarky, all good sir."

There may not be any linemen NOW but there was..............  Every hear of BRUCE SMITH........I remember reading about him having a 4% body fat body that KILLED QB's Weekly......... 200 sacks in his career says it all.  When they try to compare Mario Williams with Bruce Smith I just laugh. Bruce was UNBELIEVABLE.....Williams only plays the QB for a sack.....just watch him...he does not play the run..this drives me CRAZY......Bruce was not only the BEST  defensive end to sack the QB but was also excellent against the run. He was so quick that many times he caught the running back from the back side when they ran away from him. Boy do I miss watching him.  BTW I said ""non linemen"" meaning excluding linemen."
934536,Mister G,2015-09-15 20:29:00,1429,"I almost forgot the Peyton Manning question..........  He's 39 year old I believe and he's been thru the wringer a few times and has thousands of miles on that right arm. With all that said, I still believe he's the greatest QB to ever play QB. He hasn't had the best teams surrounding him like Brady or Rodgers but somehow always finds a way to win. I'm sure there are 20 teams right now that would love to have him as their starting QB, Buffalo included.  I don't know if this is his last year, I hope not because I do enjoy watching him. He'll probably get Denver in the playoffs again this year, but without him they don't make it.  I remember when fans in Buffalo want Kelly to retire (1-3 years too early) and he did........how's that worked out for them.  Watch out what you wish for.  As far as Manning need the money, I HIGHLY doubt it. He's a smart man and I'm sure he's a very rich man with many investments increasing his wealth. I think he just loves the game too much to hang up the cleats. And when he does how long do you think he will be out of the game before someone makes him a head coach.  BTW my first granddaughter is named Peyton and she's the cutest  thing out there.....and her dad played college football. . . . ."
934556,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 21:30:00,8243,"Bruce Smith. We went to his first exhibition game at Rich Stadium after being picked 1st by Buffalo. After his first series we turned to each other and said ""WOW"". He did a 360 outside move then 180 and ran down Chuck Dickerson from behind. He outran Dickerson. The rest is history. I had a few Molson's at a charity golf tourney in The Falls along with Kelly and a few others a few years back when I had 7% body fat, yes he had 4% body fat. I stand corrected. I wish he retired a Bill, one of the worse free agency signings by Washington, ever. Kelly could have played much longer but his son Hunter was much more important than Football and I respect that immensely.  I just don't know why Manning would risk being in a wheelchair when he could have retired on top. Special people to extraordinary things. He is one of them."
934558,manitoubass2,2015-09-15 21:40:00,11391,4% bodyfat lol
934573,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-15 23:17:00,8243,You know 4% body fat M2B2. I had veins in my abs. Sick when I think about drinking white vinegar to look good. A long time ago.
934575,manitoubass2,2015-09-15 23:24:00,11391,"Most athletes never acheive 4% (and when they do its for a very short term and usually assisted)  When DEXA came along it changed everything for bodyfat measurements.  Only athletes i can think of that perform near that level of bodyfat are long distance runners, swimmers and the like.  Nobody in the nfl could perform at the highest level at 4% bodyfat and thats a fact.  6% is about as low as it goes, and when your between 240-320lbs thats a massive difference.  And why would you drink vinegar to get leaner? That makes zero sense at all brother?  Winstrol, trenbolone acetate and clenbuterol, oh and some ephedrine/caffeine and maybe even DNP and you can reach that level of bf, but your sure as heck aint playing an nfl game like that!"
934637,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 14:19:00,11391,"And yes I think manning is done.  You could even see it last year.  One of the best to ever do it thats for sure.  Question is, when does he start coaching? The man is brilliant when it comes to football"
934677,davew3,2015-09-16 19:14:00,430,GO CATS GO !!!   Grey Cup again ?   win this year ?

934695,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-16 21:03:00,8243,"I'm really enjoying watching the Cats play this year actually since they actually have a real deal coach to lead them, Fun to watch after all those years of mediocre play. It's really extra fun beating TO. I hope an east final has them there too. A far as the Cup, let's get there first."
934728,Steve,2015-09-16 23:18:00,2075,"Hamilton has a OHL team again eh...wonder how long this one will last....  Well, now that they aren't the farm team of Montreal, they will get support, lol.  Not many fans of the toilet seats here in Hammertown"
934789,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-17 03:00:00,8243,"Steve, what's the reference to the toilet seats? Montreal? I haven't followed the NHL since the 80's."

934799,Mister G,2015-09-17 10:53:00,1429,"OK, maybe we have enough interest in this NFL stuff here........maybe  So let's play just for fun a survivor pick game here for ANYONE who wants to get in on this. BRAGGING RIGHTS ONLY......TRASH TALK ENCOURAGED........  Rules are you pick ONE team per week to  WIN and if it does your still in the game. If  your pick loses your OUT for the rest of the year. Once you pick a team you can never pick that team again for this year. So if you picked Buffalo to win last week your still in the game but you can NOT use Buffalo again.......so we will give everyone who wants to play a bye last week, meaning yes you can still pick ANYONE this week. Picks MUST be in before 1pm Sunday if it's a Sunday game. If there is a Thursday or Monday game it must be in prior to that game's kickoff.  Here's my pick this week........SAINTS  (if they lose I am out, if they win I pick again next week but can't use Saints again)"

933760,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-11 21:36:00,8243,"Any prediction for tonight Argo, Cats game? I think the Argos take it by 3.  I think the wages some pros make is obscene but they make the owners richer so everyone's happy. If a pro takes home 40 cents on the dollar they are doing well. I was surprised to learn that players on the Bills have to pay fees to use the stadium. The list of bankrupt athletes is staggering."
933832,Mister G,2015-09-12 12:07:00,1429,"Old Ironmaker, please explain what you mean that Bills players pay a fee to use the stadium. Never heard of that before."
933843,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 13:11:00,8243,Yes Mr.G. I read it last year on the Bills discussion board. Each player has to pay a tax to Erie County. A user fee to use The Ralph because they are basically independent contractors. I think it's about 10K per player based on their game day pay.
933844,Mister G,2015-09-12 13:17:00,1429,"HUH, never heard of that one.............I do know that NFL players or anyone for that matter must pay income taxes to where the event is held. So Bills players would pay taxes to Florida when they play the Dolphins and taxes to New Jersey when they play either the Jets or Giants, etc.......Same holds true if a concert is held somewhere, that performer pays income taxes also."
933904,mr blizzard,2015-09-12 18:33:00,1589,"2 great rivals today Sask vs Winnipeg,,,,,,Then Calgary and Edmonton Common Ironmaker give your predictions"
933907,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-12 18:44:00,8243,"Sask wins by a field goal. Calgary by 10. Take it to the bank. Actually keep it in your pocket. I don't make wagers, anymore. I will pick a 10 dollar Pro Line parlay for Sundays NFL games week 1 only based on what colours the uniforms and my wife likes those colours are or what city she would rather live in. I won a cut throat pool a few years back. Pick a team each week to win no spread straight up, you can never pick that team again during the season, lose once and you are out. The call had to be in by noon every Friday to a receptionist at a company I did business with. Every week I would ask her where she would rather live and the next week what colour combination did she prefer? 16 games, 16 wins."

Growing up my parents had season tickets from about 1970 to 1990. One of my earliest memories is standing on a cold snowy sidewalk in Westdale in 1972 watching the Grey cup parade with my parents.  There's been a lot of lean years and it's great to be a fan right now. Today was an especially good day."
933178,mr blizzard,2015-09-08 18:25:00,1589,"Agreed Mike as I mentioned earlier when they were relocated for a while the fans still kept attending games, the Ticats are my favourite team in the east for that reason, they have a fan based support like many western teams have had for  a long time, hopefully the support will rub of on the rest of the eastern conference, I still say its a great game and the heads of the CFL have tried hard to bring the league up to speed again, nice to see more about it in flyers on the radio, various promotions, contest etc"
933222,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-08 22:44:00,8243,"It's great to see the support the CFL is getting in the last few years. I think going to TSN is a plus, and spreading the games across the week. The support out west is far greater than here because of all the pro sports available to Canadian fans in the east. Jays, NHL, Ottawa, Mont. Leafs. Plus Buffalo is an hour and a half drive from T.O. 20,000 Buffalo Bills seasons tickets are Canadians. Then you have the Sabres too.  You don't get more frenzied fans than in Saskatchewan.  What's the answer when a ball player is told they are going to Saskatchewan? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""I retire.""  Buffalo cuts QB Matt Cassel on Saturday, rehires him this AM for 4.1 million bucks less and names him QB 2 ahead of EJ Manual. Are there no labor laws in the US.? Why not fire a guy on Friday afternoon and call him back Monday morning for less? I don't get that."
933226,Mister G,2015-09-08 22:58:00,1429,The NFL has it's own players union and the Bills did it according to contract.  They could of just not called him back and then he's just sitting at home making nothing or he could of refused to sign with the Bills in HOPES some other team comes a calling.

933267,pics,2015-09-09 02:28:00,1268,"Pro sports leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth . With baseball you have rich teams basically buying championships since there is no real salary  cap.. The NFL is a money making machine that holds cities hostage in order to get new stadiums, some of which get replaced even before taxpayers pay for it .. as for hockey, Gary Bettman insists on putting teams where they have no business case.. the maple leafs tampering with the city selection process to prevent Hamilton from entering the league ... It goes on and on.. money ruins sports... kind of why I like the CFL.. players in it for the love of the game, certainly not for the money.."
933383,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-09 19:52:00,8243,"I hear you Pics. I remember when I was a kid and my Italian Nono from Western NY telling me "" Micky Mantle donta paya you papas mortaga for him, youra Papa isa you hero."" How perfect was that. I can't relate with 100 million dollar 5 year contracts when I have to go to the grocery store and check the sales. So I can relate to CFL salaries. A guy working in the steel plant makes more than the average CFL wage. Tim Teebo was just cut. He was told go to the CFL and get some reps. I would love to see him here. He is the quintessential CFL QB, and I welcome him. Just like Flutie when he was discarded by the NFL. This is Canada, bring us the outcasts and we will show you how wrong the experts were."

CFL is people that love the game, train hard and work as a team.  You dont see that flamboyant wr in the cfl do ya?  They work.  When I met the winni team a few years back, just normal guys(130lbs heavier than me albiet)  Super humble and polite"

And the quality of the athletes in the CFL are not sub par, they just have a much different skill set. It's a different game.  The only thing I'm willing to admit as a fan of both leagues is the reffing in the CFL is a complete disgrace. Beyond that I like it waaaaay more than the NFL.  I do realize I'm in the minority here LOL"

Ill always always be a huge fan of the nfl too though.  Both are just gnarly sports, and both entertaining in different ways.

I don't know where he is but he's not playing I don't think. Dave Stalla is the best non ""throw me the ball because I'm great"" wide receiver as of late. I love the guy.  I played with a guy starting in H.S. Jack Blair and latter with the Hamilton Hurricanes. He played special teams and second team D for Hamilton. He left practice to put in his shift at the LCBO in Hammertown and built houses when he wasn't busy. ESPN did a show following him in the 80's.  That's the CFL in a nut shell."

Not 5, not 15, 100 million freakin bucks for a D tackle that might get 10 sacks a year, which he did last year to lead the league. 10 mil a sack if he never gets another. That money is obscene to me. COME ON MAN!  The opener tonight had more hype than the Super Bowl a few years back. 14/3  New England 11:15 in the 3rd.  100 mil, I can't get my head around that."

Would you begrudge what one of your children make, I know I wouldn't.  BTW those reported salaries are NOT what is actually sent to their bank account, minus agent fees and taxes....not to mention a lot of that money is BONUS money they never reach.....PLUS they don't invest it wisely and have many friends that they must take care of.........ANYONE here see 30 for 30 Broke on ESPN (or something like that).....FUNNY stuff......these athletes invest in STUPID stuff.....and then can't figure out why in 5 years they are BROKE......(most big time paid players are)...Bernie Kosar's (former Cleveland QB) dad stole all of his money. He filed bankruptcy years ago. I feel bad for him."
932765,Mister G,2015-09-05 00:38:00,1429,"First of all ""golf"" is not  a sport but rather a form of recreation because the so called other golfer has no bearing on what you do.........if the other golfer could smack said ball back at the golfer that originally hit the ball then it would be a sport..........same could be said for bowling or fishing for that matter.  The best thing that happened to da Bills  in the last 12 months was  when Coach Marrone quit his job. The Jags deserve him.  The second best thing that happened to da Bills is the hiring of T-Rex....give him 3 years and da Bills should go deep into the playoffs.  Time will tell with QB Taylor or EJ.......but looking at the history of either one it's not looking good. Tyrod Taylor has a lifetime completion percentage of 57%.......EJ not so much."

932775,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-05 01:17:00,8243,"T Mobile, aka Tyrod Taylor, has been Joe Flaco's back up for all 4 of his NFL seasons. Yes his passing stats stink. But I don't think you can gauge a QB on 35 pass attempts over 4 years. We will see what he does over the first 4 games, he doesn't produce he's out and Manual is in. He does go 3 and 1 Manual waits in the wings until he gets injured. As a running QB it isn't ""if"" you get hurt  in the NFL it's when. There are exceptions but can't name one other than Y.A. Tittle. Yes I'm getting old. Y.A. Tittle, man if you saw him scramble you're old as well."
932777,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-05 01:21:00,8243,Manning will play until they carry him off the field with his noggin attached by a few ligaments. He has too many debt's maybe. A sane person would have retired the first time he broke his neck. The talking heads say he isn't able to feel his fingers. Maybe he has gambling debt or his wife like blingy stuff.

Fouts and Marino aren't dead yet. Oh you mean to Football, I don't think they would fare well with their age and all. I know guys like that would do anything to put the pads back on. I think I told you I stood a few feet from Marino one day when he was throwing 30 yards on a rope. It sounded like a golf ball was going by at 150 mile per hour, swoooosh! I wonder if they ever timed his throw with a radar gun. Google that, I have a Golf tourney tomorrow and need to get my inner Zen  in line and need to rest. Golf isn't a sport, 100% right. If I can still golf it can't be a sport. Like Poker on a sports network. Come on man!!!!!!"
932784,mr blizzard,2015-09-05 02:16:00,1589,"Just try watching our own football the CFL sometimes, more offensive, and if u track the final scores of the Grey Cup vs the Superbowl over the past 20 years u might be pleasantly surprized to see the cfl final to be more of a nail biter, But the commentaters in the nfl are more polished and simply there is more betting money involved in the nfl It is interesting that the Jays have a great deal of support in an international sport but a just Canadian league sometimes gets second rating, must be the tailgait parties lol I like watching the NFL but I will check out the CFL games first just saying, Sunday and Monday great games on the tube"
932787,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-05 02:45:00,8243,"I hear you about the close Grey Cup games Blizzard. I remember in the 60's when my Uncle from the us said "" I wish we had the NFL Championship like the Grey Cup"" Not for the scores but we had a week long party years before they did. I do enjoy watching CFL. It just isn't supported here like hockey. A first year CFL players salary is around 50K. A rookie salary down there around 500K. No one in the CFL earns 500K. I think the highest paid in the last few years was Calvillo and Ricky Ray at 400K estimated because CFL salaries are confidential. The CFL are just not in the same league with the NFL like it or not. Heck a high school game I went to in Youngstown Ohio drew 35,000 people 20 years ago. We can't draw those numbers here. And yes a dog game in the NFL can sound like life or death as described by some NFL talking heads. There is zero interest in the Jays when they are losing, the Leafs lose and they pack the place. It's Canada eh.  Google search says the average CFL salary is approximately 80K today. An Industrial Mechanic makes that without OT."
932795,Dusky,2015-09-05 03:27:00,310,"Cowboys fan since my university days (University was next to the old cowboys stadium in Irving, TX). No high hopes for my team as long as Jerry Jones is owner.. but I am hoping they will make it post regular season. About Bills, Rex Ryan will be Rex Ryan and will do same as what he did with Jets, plenty of noise and press coverage with not much result. In the end he will find some Mark Sanchez or Geno Smith to blame his failure.  As for super bowl, my guess is Patriots vs. Packers final. Though I would not be surprise if Eagles or 49ers pull off from NFC and Broncos from AFC."

Beamer had some great atheletes that have made it to the nfl but they didn't make it because of his qb coaching. Hopefully Taylor can be a good game manager and the bills can run the ball and play good d.

Who do you like, who don't you like? Who do you hate? Anything Football related. Type away.  I was born into a Buffalo Bills and Tiger Cat family.

Either Matt Cassel or former 1st round pick EJ Manual to be back up. I say they cut Cassel to save 5 mil against the cap and <annual backs him up. Phil Simms son goes to the practice squad. If Taylor doesn't produce Manual is ready to go, again. This will be Manuals last chance as a starter if he gets a chance unless someone else wants him now, like the Argos."

If shady can stay healthy they should be alright. Their defense will be one of the best this year. Similar scenario in Philly this year. Bradford needs to stay healthy for them to have a big season. I think Jordan Matthews will have a breakout season. Regular season starts a week from today and I'm pumped.

You won't see Brady in a courtroom until next year and by that time something else will be in the news.  The guy that broke Gino Smiths jaw in the locker room last month cut by the Bills. Ekempali I think his name is. Another Rex Ryan move to get the Bills in the national spotlight. There will be more Bills related reports this year than in the last 25 since Rex became head coach because of his antics good or bad. Record year for season ticket sales at 60,000 and they haven't played a down yet.  I predict a Green Bay New England Super Bowl. Patriots win and Belichik and Brady retire and go silently into the sunset. Baltimore/New England AFC championship, Greenbay/Seatle NFC."
