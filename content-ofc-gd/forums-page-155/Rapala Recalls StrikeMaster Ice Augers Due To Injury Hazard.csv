937930,manitoubass2,2015-10-03 02:42:00,11391,Whats the hazard? I dont see it mentioned.  Thanks for the heads up!
937932,OhioFisherman,2015-10-03 02:46:00,6623,""" Hazard: The trigger switch on the auger could fail and the unit not turn off, posing an injury hazard. ""  It is on there, right under recall summary."

937958,Fisherman,2015-10-03 11:55:00,7201,I think that's about a year old already.  But better to know than getting wound up with an auger.
