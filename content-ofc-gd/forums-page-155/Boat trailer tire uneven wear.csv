936668,lew,2015-09-26 21:11:00,12766,well I couldn't get the 1/2 inch bolts holding the spare on to the trailer loose  Good idea to loosen those wheel lugs at least once a year and re-torque them just so you know they'll loosen up when you need them to.

I had Springwater Trailers swap the axle on our ShoreLand'r about a month ago due to a bent axle.  They're in Barrie right at the 26 cutoff on Bayfield.  Thanks Dan and Bill. I took the wheels off and visually checked the axle. No sign of it been bent at all. I probably should have measured with a tape.

Tire pressure was good, boat trailer is level, camber right on, etc.   after a number of calls to BPS, where I bought the boat, they replaced the tires.  Finally got Tracker to admit the tires supplied with the trailer were bad.   Even the replacements wore the same way.   Heck with BPS and Tracker.  I went to a local tire dealer and picked up a good set of radial tires.   Three years now and no sign of un-even wear.  I keep mine filled to the recommendation is on my trailer - and that is 50 PSI Cold.  I check them before each trip and periodically when the boat is not being used."

You will find the trailer pulls a lot easier too at the correct pressure.  In all honesty your tires should dry up, crack and die of old age long before they wear out on these light boat trailers as long as the inflation and alignment is right.  They don't brake.steer, or accelerate, they just kind of tag along for the ride and should last a very long time.  http://www.carlisletransportationproducts.com/product/tires/trailers-toy-haulers-towables/sport-trail"

I learnt a lesson this past weekend on the lake. At the end of the fishing day, I was ready to head back to the boat ramp, turned the engine key and nothing happened. It turned out the starting battery was completely drained by the fishing finder, and the live well pump which I accidentally left on. I wanted to disconnect the trolling motor battery and use it for starting the engine, however, I don't have a pair of proper pliers on the boat to do it. I used to keep a pair in the boat but took it off due to rusting. Luckily the trolling motor still had a lot of battery left, I trolled to the nearest cottage and borrowed a pair of pliers, swapped the batteries and started the engine.  By the way, I really want to thank the cottage owner for allowing me to borrow his pliers (If you are reading, you know who you are)."

936320,lew,2015-09-24 19:59:00,12766,"I also carry a small set of booster cables in the boat so that if the starting battery dies...which it did this summer...it's easy to get a boost off one of the deep cycles.  Also a good idea to check the lug wrench for your truck wheels and see if it fits the lugs on your boat trailer, because they often don't. You don't want to be sitting on the side of the road with a flat tire on your trailer in the middle of no-where with a wrench in your hand that doesn't fit."

936521,Flappn,2015-09-25 18:34:00,245,"On the trailer topic, I was wondering if anyone has experienced what I am experiencing.  When pulling the boat (roughly 4000lbs) at about 110km per hour my truck starts to vibrate/shake. The truck is a 2015 Ford F150 so I want to believe it's not the truck. So if it's not the truck, I am assuming it something with the trailer. The Trailer is 3 years old and is a dual axle. When not towing the truck does not vibrate/shake at any speed.  Any idea's of what it might be? I have heard square tire, bad bearing, bad tire....but being 3 years old and no visible tire wear or square issues it has me confused. I checked all the bearing buddies and there was no lack of grease. Tire's say 50 PSI and 50 PSI is what they are at.  One person recommended balancing the tires..has anyone heard of that? I've never heard of balancing trailer tires.  Any feeback/help would be very much appreciated."
936525,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-25 18:56:00,10439,Have you had the trailer tires balanced? Sounds like an out of balance situation. I would start there.
936533,Sinker,2015-09-25 19:44:00,8692,"Do you have a strap that is vibrating in the wind somewhere on the boat? I have had that happen, and now always put a couple twists in the strap to stop it from vibrating.  S."

936599,Andy,2015-09-26 10:22:00,330,I also had that problem once. I just couldn't figure it out. Then I noticed that one tire had a bulge that slowly got worse until it was ready to blow. I'd take the tires to a tire shop for inspection/balancing.
936600,Fisherman,2015-09-26 12:04:00,7201,"Have you had the trailer tires balanced? Sounds like an out of balance situation. I would start there. I'll bet 90% of trailer tires don't get balanced..properly.  Most don't even realize they're lug centric and need the adapter plate to spin properly on the balance machine.  Why would ya balance trailer tires anyway, there's no one in the boat going down the highway, so what if things shake a bit."
936605,bigbuck,2015-09-26 12:54:00,2449,"Trailer tires do not get balanced routinely. They are not designed to travel at very high speeds. Guys that go 120kph+ pulling a trailer are insane. Keep it under 110. I see guys on the 400 passing me like I am standing still while I am doing 110 and they are pulling a boat, many with the little dinky tires. A few weeks ago we saw one bonehead pulling his tinny with one tire missing, just the rim, I pulled up to him and told him, his reply, ' thanks' and he kept going. Gotta wonder sometimes what goes through people's heads."

The rest of the tire and the other tire are completed normal. I am wondering if any of you have had the same issue and could help me out here:  1) What could have caused the issue? I checked the bearing and bearing buddy, grease level is very low, but did not find any water or free play in the hub. Will repack the bearing anyways just in case. 2) If wheel alignment is off or need balancing, where can I take it to get it corrected. I tried Canadian Tire, but they don't service boat trailers.

It is very confusing on the tire side wall. One place says ""Max load 670 kg (1480lb) at 350kPa (50psi) cold"", while another place under ""Safty warning"" on the same tire says ""Never exceed 220 kPa (32 psi) Pressure"". Should I do 32 or 50 psi?  I have always maintained 32 psi for both tires because of that ""warning"", since the other tire does not have uneven wear problem at all, I assume the pressure is ok, otherwise, I probably would have wear on both edges of both tires.

935923,Andy,2015-09-22 23:04:00,330,"My current trailer had the same issue when I first had it. I had bought the boat and trailer used, but it had only been used a year or two when I bought it. I had to replace a tire the first year because one tire feathered that badly. I was going through a tire per year. I first put the boat and trailer on car jacks and I measured the distance of the tires/hubs/axle from the front and rear of the frame. It wasn't mounted squarely and I bumped one side ahead a bit. It didn't resolve the issue, so I put the whole works on the cars jacks again and I removed the axle and tires. I took the axle to a local welding/repair shop and we measured the distance between the hubs from the top, bottom, front and back of the hub. The front and back (the toe) were not the same, so we put the axle in a press and we bent it until the hubs were even front and back. It didn't take much. If I remember correctly, the top and bottom (the camber) were close so I left that alone. (The wear I had was a real feathering, not just increased wear that may occur if the camber is really out of whack.) It's been 3 or 4 years now and both tires are still quite good with lots of miles on them. Possible reasons for my ""toe"" being out include a factory defect, or damage from  pulling out of a bad ramp or hitting  a hole too quickly or hard. So I would start by making sure your axle is square on the frame. A simple measuring tape will do this. (remember that the frame may not be perfectly even in length on both sides, I'd rely on measuring  from the front to the hub or tire the most.) Then check the toe and camber. When I went to the welding shop, a tape measure was sufficient. I believe my camber was out about 1/4 inch. I'm not a mechanic, but this worked for me. Good luck, Andy"

Ahh, good point! Sorry I am not mechanically savvy and did not know what ""seat the bead"" mean until a moment ago after some googling. So I will inflate to 45 psi. This under inflation could be part of the problem if not THE only problem... hopefully.  The wear is on the outside edge of the curb side tire. I don't know if I was driving too close to the curb. I will pay attention next time when I tow."
