After about an hour I had caught a couple perch.  The part of the lake we were at was really weedy so every now and then I had to bring in my lure to take the weeds off.  As my lure was 5 feet away from the boat i saw a massive small mouth take my lure.  I got it in the boat and it was 20"" the biggest of the year. "
