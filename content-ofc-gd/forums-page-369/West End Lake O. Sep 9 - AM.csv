Took us a while to find them...started with few nice silver kings and followed up with bunch of bows later on. Spoons(watermelon NK Mag, Monkey Puke Mag, Michael Jackson) and flies (green, blue and white) all worked...200-300 fow, 55'-65' down. 2.5-2.7 mph at the ball. Ended up 12/15 with last two lost fish been the biggest...last one broke my 50 lbs fluoro line between the treble and single hook on the A-Tom-Mik fly.  Few shots from the day:           Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
