728272,BillM,2012-09-08 00:23:00,17367," Yeah, 50mms in Alliston will blow out that river with ease.  Unless you like fishing chocolate milk, I'd find something else to do."
728273,Christopheraaron,2012-09-08 00:25:00,3525, Other than fishing?!
728276,BillM,2012-09-08 00:38:00,17367, I should have said 'another fishing venue'
728277,Jer,2012-09-08 00:43:00,1426," Thanks Joey, it was a consideration at one point. Good thing we thoght better of it...    That's what I keep telling Sandra.    You wanna take my place??"
728352,danbouck,2012-09-08 14:45:00,4380,It's my anniversary and I have another wedding to go to today. I don't think I'll be fishing.  But tomorrow is a different story
728361,GBW,2012-09-08 15:46:00,8460,it's not too bad here so I may go out shortly but that all depends on what the Mrs has to say about getting ready for my daughters b-day party today.
728146,SlowPoke,2012-09-07 14:44:00,2984,Purple = bad!
728147,BillM,2012-09-07 14:45:00,17367,There will be lots of salmons!!!!   Catchings salmons with my 5 diamonds in the back!
728169,Christopheraaron,2012-09-07 16:46:00,3525," Im pier fishing, and I can tell you that I'm hoping for buckets!"
728182,12footspringbok,2012-09-07 17:49:00,459,Couple inches of rain overnight and strong northwest winds starting in the morning.

728207,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-07 20:25:00,2690,"Great day to stay home, play cards and order some Chinese take out!!!"
728208,jedimaster,2012-09-07 20:44:00,3472,Will be out bass fishing..... great. better have the rain coat ready to go. haha
728210,davey buoy,2012-09-07 20:47:00,5505,"Not a fan of fishing in 100% rain forecast in a boat or on bank. Everyone going out,good luck,better you than me. Lol."
728213,jedimaster,2012-09-07 20:55:00,3472,"2 day tourney for me so no choice, haha"
728214,davey buoy,2012-09-07 21:06:00,5505, Of all the weekends eh?geeez!
728215,Handlebarz,2012-09-07 21:09:00,3790,Looks like a off shore wind that's not bad
728216,misfish,2012-09-07 21:40:00,29133,They just canceled the heavy rain fall here. River might be safe for the morning.
728218,Rich,2012-09-07 21:44:00,3927,As long as the wind isnt reaaaallly bad..... Ill be out!
728232,SirCranksalot,2012-09-07 22:41:00,3291, ?  Still 40 mm in forecast foe 'da Beach'.
728235,misfish,2012-09-07 22:52:00,29133,DA BEACH??
728237,Jer,2012-09-07 22:59:00,1426,I'll be tying a knot tomorrow...but not a fishing knot.
728240,Christopheraaron,2012-09-07 23:09:00,3525, Wasaga
728241,Joey,2012-09-07 23:27:00,9122,"  Congrats Jer, hope it is not an outdoor event!!!!"
728260,BillM,2012-09-08 00:02:00,17367, What you should be hoping for is a north wind to push all that warm water away.
728262,i2cool2fool,2012-09-08 00:05:00,349,Suppose to be good luck if it rains on your wedding day - so I am told. Congrats Jer!
728266,hotsky,2012-09-08 00:07:00,400,I haven't fished since Wednesday...  so I was looking forward to it. If it's not too crappy out I'll be out. Just bought a rain suite so I should be alright
728267,BillM,2012-09-08 00:08:00,17367,"  40mm at the Beach isn't going to do anything to the river...  Now, 40mm in Alliston is a different story."
728269,Christopheraaron,2012-09-08 00:12:00,3525,  Actually I'm hoping for a southernly wind (in port dalhousie) but a northernly wind wouldn't be bad as I can easily change it to bronte and I'll end up going more often anyways.
728270,BillM,2012-09-08 00:16:00,17367," Yup, south wind @ Port D would be great.  I used to fish those piers ALL the time when I was a kid..  Harbour is great for browns as well."
728271,SirCranksalot,2012-09-08 00:19:00,3291, 40-50 for Alliston. But best to stay away. The fishing will be lousy!!
