727914,Rich,2012-09-06 21:55:00,3927,"What a summer. With the drought and heatwave, the one bonus was, there always seemed to be time to fish. Fished some brutal hot days, but for the majority me and my girlfriend kept cool with our feet in the Grand River. Through the summer, I fished sections from Kitchener, all the way to Dunnville. And not one of them is a ""bad stretch"".     Maddie's PB!       My buddy Rob with a nice Grand River pike   My buddy Derek with a nice one, also from the Grand   And the biggest I've ever caught in the Grand, but boy have I seen some biggies!  Summer became a little more mobile when I purchased an inflatable boat. It fits in the trunk of the car, yet takes an electric motor, tons of gear, 2 batteries, 2 fisherpeople.. I love it. Wish I had it all my life, really. It`s so convenient. And setup & takedown don`t really take all that long.    From there on out it was mostly big bass on the agenda. And while I only caught a few true hawgs, I sure did catch a LOT of decent bass this season. It was a great summer, even on the worst of days, for bass fishing.                  And a few other mix-ins from the days we WEREN`T bass fishing.             Rob with a beauty brown, caught while carp fishing the backyard  And finally, Rob and I joined forces again recently to put a whooping on some bass, and Rob did all the whoopin` this time. Featuring his main event, I`m pretty sure it was his PB and the best part is it gave us a topwater show when it ANNIHILATED his buzzbait, coming over a stump. What a perfect morning scene that was.    Hope you enjoyed, and hope everyone`s fall is hawg-filled and safe."
