727556,esoxansteel,2012-09-05 18:50:00,1307,"That release shot on the musky is postcard worthy, and a beautiful marked fish, and you dont look to bad yourself Roy"
727559,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-05 19:23:00,957,Nice report Roy.  Good move not to remove the fish from the water.
727569,cram,2012-09-05 19:56:00,1733,Really pretty musky. WTG.
727587,Moosebunk,2012-09-05 21:08:00,3970,"Sharp looking Ski Roy, and cool pic.  There's a fish species I can't catch for the life of me. lol."

728268,danc,2012-09-08 00:09:00,4677,Sweet report Roy. That's a really pretty Musky my friend. Thanks!
728274,Christopheraaron,2012-09-08 00:28:00,3525,"And this is why he is our superior, great stuff Roy!"
728322,MJL,2012-09-08 11:32:00,2427,Awesome catches Roy
728330,kickingfrog,2012-09-08 12:53:00,8333," No need, many of us can confirm Roy is that tall.   They are nice fish pics."
728362,Roy,2012-09-08 15:47:00,13728,"So I got out to do the push-cart thing this morning, put the groceries away then come here to find this. You guys are crazy! HAHAHAHAHA! Sometimes I think what a good time it would be to spend a day in the boat with some of you dudes."
728366,Skipper D,2012-09-08 16:07:00,1970,  That would be good but no way would we all fit ............
726816,Roy,2012-09-03 03:04:00,13728,"It was a super fine day, cloud and sunshine, not too hot and very little wind. Just a wonderful day really. I was able to get 56 inches (the hard way  ) for team one. That should help a little. The procrastination has got to stop...I have to get out more and produce a little.  A little tired tonight. I'll put up a report tomorrow."
726818,Skipper D,2012-09-03 03:12:00,1970,"Glad to hear you made it out all tho i could'nt find you out there any where ...... lol ,  can't wait to veiw your report tomorrow ."
726820,Roy,2012-09-03 03:20:00,13728,You were probably fishing way west of me. How did you make out? Did you have a good day?
726821,Leecher,2012-09-03 03:21:00,7832,Was wondering where you were going to go fishing.... haven't had a reply to my PM I sent you.
726822,Roy,2012-09-03 03:24:00,13728,Damn! Sorry Jacques....when I got the PM I was rushed and got sidetracked! We'll get together soon I hope.
726826,Skipper D,2012-09-03 03:37:00,1970,"  I did Roy , it was PB after PB all Saturday morning while on the Larry for me  , I arrived home a bit earlyer tonight , am  unwinding and resting up a bit for now then  i'll be going to work on a report later to post up for our morning readers .."
726871,Billy Bob,2012-09-03 15:10:00,5865,PICTURES Roy.....we need to see pics or I could say I just fished the Lake of the Woods this morning but made it back early with my limit....LOL
726880,Rich Clemens,2012-09-03 15:38:00,3131,"It is ""TOMORROW"" now .... So where's this so-called report ?"
726956,Skipper D,2012-09-03 20:39:00,1970,"Roy ......... Roy ......... Roy ........... come on Roy ........ Roy it's time to wake up now , its getting late !!"
726962,Roy,2012-09-03 21:04:00,13728,"Yeah, so at the last minute I decided to stay on the Larry as opposed to driving very far. It turned out to be a great  day weather wise and friend wise. Aside from just having a good day, my goal was to grab a few points for team  #1 which I've been neglecting and I didn't feel too good about that either. We hit the water around 8:45 and it really  was a glorious day.  We trolled for a while but were not really paying attention ...I suspect we had a lot of catching up to do with family  news etc...  The first hit was a big fish. It wasn't a rip, it was a grunt. You can really tell when a big one hits. It was not to be, it  was my error....I just didn't hit back. Anyhow, I wanted a few points for the team and I think I got a few. But they were  definitely not what I would have expected. Got two fish that we didn't have in the standings...also small fish for the  species but it all adds up. Me brudder Brian threw in a whitie that we absolutely needed to even be in the race.  Water temp was 73.4 in the morning and 73.9 come evening so that fish didn't leave the water. A small fish but a  healthy male.    Good chance I'll get a bigger one before closing.  Another small fish here for the species but healthy and that was comforting.  Also wanted to do some tubing...no giant by any means but hey. It was still fun.  <a href=""http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/?action=view&current=IMG_0136.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/IMG_0136.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  I have other pics somewhere.  I'm really glad that a lot of people had a great time this Labour Day weekend."
