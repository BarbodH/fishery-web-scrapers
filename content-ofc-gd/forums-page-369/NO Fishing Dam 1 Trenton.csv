While they're at it, they might as well build fences down the sides or just block off all access completely. That would protect us right??? I wonder if they considered how many more people are going to start using the train bridge now. I know they do now, you can see their trail. There's going to be a whole bunch more now I bet. That sounds safe. I don't know who built these, if it was Quinte West, Parks Canada or who, but I'd sure like to write a letter of disgust to someone right now and tell them to shove their rules and barbed wire fence right up their ass instead of down our throats like usual. It is unfortunate about the deaths that have occurred at this dam. But what's next to protect us? Barbed wire fences across public roads because people die in car accidents? If you want to stop people going out on the piers, simply put a better stop on the piers themselves. If you want to block people from crossing the dam, build a proper footbridge across the river close to this area as they have in Peterborough. Sorry for the rant. I'll do better if I find out who to direct this to. In the meantime, anyone got a gas powered steel saw I can borrow...so i can fish Walleye again!"
