TJunkie  p.s. It's not fully finished yet   More camo needs to be added but getting there   Looking great so far  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2FHunting%2FDeerBlindProject2012-TJunkie.mp4"">"
726841,gino,2012-09-03 12:36:00,400,"Oh Jacque, this looks like the Lexus of the deer blinds...   you are definitely be comfortable in there"
726978,Leecher,2012-09-03 21:30:00,7832, Thanks Gino!!!  Yeah it's going to be real comfy in there that's for sure  Here's the final product in the camo department  Front View     Inside view    Other Sides      The proud me    and again    I do have a video but the lack of interest... not posting it     sorry Tight lines TJunkie
727790,fishnsled,2012-09-06 17:23:00,3520," Quite the documentary video Jacques! A bit of weather striping around the door and windows, some insulation and it could double as an ice shanty."
727962,Leecher,2012-09-07 00:08:00,7832,"  Thanks Will!!!  Yeah I had quite a bit of editing to do since on every update, a video was created     Took just a little over 4 hours to produce   The final results is right on money and can't wait to set it up on my hunting grounds  Great idea for an ice shanty   but, this beast is going to be staying year round in the bush    Man O Man I'm pumped and just can't wait"
727964,danc,2012-09-07 00:16:00,4677,Wow Jacques. Nice job man. I can almost smell the maple syrup oozing out of the wood.
727972,Leecher,2012-09-07 00:31:00,7832, Thanks Dan!!!  That camo pattern was something else to create   This a full days of work     It should blend real nice where it's going to be setup    I'll try and get some shots when it's installed in it's permanent location
727976,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-07 00:38:00,2690,"I'm with Will, Jacques, looks like it would double as an awesome ice hut!  Great job, enjoy!!"
727980,Leecher,2012-09-07 00:59:00,7832," Thanks mon ami!!!  Yeah that would most definitely be doable.... but where it's going to be setup and where I usually ice fish... your looking at 4+ hours drive   Lots of work involved to setup, haul and setup again  My current ice fishing shelter is one of the best around  2010 Cruze   It's comfy, reliable and not too hard on the back for hauling"
727987,Stoty,2012-09-07 01:17:00,2910,Very cool!!! Great job!
727991,Leecher,2012-09-07 01:23:00,7832, Thanks Stoty!!! Much appreciated
728162,mirogak,2012-09-07 16:12:00,387,Non-hunter question alert!  Good job man but how do you transport that thing to the hunting spot?
728350,Leecher,2012-09-08 14:41:00,7832," Thanks lgf!!!  I will take it apart and put the panels in a trailer to transport it... once at destination (brother's lot), brother and I will carry each panel in the bush and put it back together again  It will be a full day's work    Once finished, we're going to check the deer feeder and drop some food"
728404,nofish4me,2012-09-08 20:16:00,404,"Looks Great, shove some insulation, wood stove and cut some holes in the floor, ya got a great ice fishing shack.  Hahaha"
728520,Leecher,2012-09-09 16:12:00,7832, Thanks nofish4me!!!  The thought did cross my mind... but this one is going to be staying in the bush year round
728527,misfish,2012-09-09 17:03:00,29133,"Like the idea of the BBQ right outside bud. Shoot,gut and cook.LMAO  Nice job."
728528,paul_614,2012-09-09 17:14:00,168,and it's within shooting distance of the tomatoes....
728546,Leecher,2012-09-09 19:54:00,7832, Thanks Brian!!!  Don't I wish it was that simple   Thanks paul_614!!!
