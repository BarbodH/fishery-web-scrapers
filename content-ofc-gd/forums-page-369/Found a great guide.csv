728518,UglyBug,2012-09-09 15:50:00,148,"I wanted to take a few minutes to thank Mike Rousseau for two great guide excursions for walleye. For the second time Mike has proved to me that he absolute knows how to guide and produce good size numbers and quality fish. Dispite tough conditions yesterday he was able to safely put us on good fishing. when the weather closed in on us, he called it and headed into shore to wait out the squall. I am a seasoned Bass fisherman and have fished some narley weather and not a lot impresses me, however the last two trips with Mike were to say the least fantastic. So much so we are already looking to book another trip in late October. If anyone is considering hiring a guide for good quality and quantities of walleye I strongly recommend hooking  up with Mike-Rousseaus-Guide-service. I know I will again  Great job Mike I had a blast, most fun you could have With your pants on, or when not fishing bass which by the way last time out With Mike I happened to put my PB in the boat  Brian"
728521,mercman,2012-09-09 16:16:00,7054,"X2 Brian Having grown up on the lake and fished it since he was old enough to walk, he could probably fish it blind. Getting us fish, while putting safety above all, is his prior is his priority, and i respect that quality in any guide. He sure taught these ole Dawgs a few things yesterday !!!  Cheers Mike !! A blast as usual my friend."
728522,Skipper D,2012-09-09 16:18:00,1970,X2 again .......... What i like most was how he took the time to make sure i under stood just exactly what it was we were doing to catch fish so you could come away from it with the confidents to repilcate what that was and have sucsess on your own .
728523,mercman,2012-09-09 16:28:00,7054,  Love that pic Skipper  Add a rain suit and thats exactly what he looked like yesterday too Relaxed and confident.
728763,mike rousseau,2012-09-10 19:39:00,4661,Thanks guys.... It helps having good people in the boat... I had fun fishing with all of you and hope to do it again soon...
728765,mercman,2012-09-10 19:42:00,7054,"  Even though i got my line wrapped in your prop???  Thats the only way i could think of, to get ya to slow down:whistling:"
728768,mike rousseau,2012-09-10 19:49:00,4661, That can happen when your night fishing in 30+km winds and trying to land a walleye on the other side of the boat and drive....  ALL WITHOUT A NET!!!!!!  First time I've ever forgot my net...lol
728772,Jigs,2012-09-10 20:02:00,136,I can't believe you guys went out in that weather. Lake looked nasty!
728787,mercman,2012-09-10 20:51:00,7054,"it was choppy for sure, but if you coulda seen Mike laid back with his feet up on the bench, not a care in the world.  Fish like weather:w00t:  He kept us in the leeward shorelines and we had no problems at all.At one point we found a small bay with no wind at all, and just relaxed there for a bit."
728797,mike rousseau,2012-09-10 21:33:00,4661, It actually wasnt bad in the islands....  Lotsa south in that wind... So we fished the south side of the river...
728810,Skipper D,2012-09-10 22:00:00,1970,"Not at all like going after The Deadliest Catch , if only it we're  like that in order to catch walleye , who would go ?"
728813,Handlebarz,2012-09-10 22:07:00,3790,I have not net Mike yet but from the guys who have I know he's a standup guy great thread
728822,UglyBug,2012-09-10 22:35:00,148,"He is indeed a standup guy, as I said have fished a lot worst by myself, however in a bigger boat   he handled himself like a total professional. As I said I was impressed."
728828,Skipper D,2012-09-10 22:52:00,1970,"Will there be a day in the future when we will hear he came into the public's eye the day he joined the family at the Ontario Fishing Community , I wish for the guy in time more people from where ever get to know and use him to find out for them selves just how such a young fisherman  comes to a sport and gets called a Great .  "
728842,mike rousseau,2012-09-10 23:26:00,4661,I appreciate all the kind words fellas... And I want to thank all of you who have fished with me for giving me the chance to show you how much I love the sport... As well as what I can do on the water... I am lucky to have met you all...
