728285,Acountdeleted,2012-09-08 01:29:00,2562,I was planning on fishing up at the cottage this weekend but the plans got kyboshed due to rough weather. I'm still thinking of taking my kayak out sunday if the weather clears up as its calling for and wanted to try a new lake. Are Canal Lake or Dalrymple doable in a kayak or if the wind picks up am I going to be in a lot of trouble?  Also if they are kinda dangerous can someone reccomend a smaller lake within 2 hours of Toronto?
728328,Paudash,2012-09-08 12:36:00,273,for a small lake Dalrymple can be nasty and I find it can turn ugly fast
728335,Acountdeleted,2012-09-08 13:15:00,2562,Thanks for the heads up. Anyone know about Canal lake?
728342,moxie,2012-09-08 14:08:00,1566, Fished Canal a few times but never been a fan. Pretty wide open as well. Mitchell Lake is small enough to cover in a day and shouldn't whip up too bad. Good luck.
728386,GBW,2012-09-08 17:37:00,8460,Why not try scugog?  It's not far and there are many places you can get off the water if the weather turns.
728428,Dave Bailey,2012-09-08 23:20:00,1641," Another vote for Mitchell.   Scugog can whip up too, lots of open water. But the Nonquon River is an option at the northwest corner."
728453,Acountdeleted,2012-09-09 00:45:00,2562,"Thanks for the help guys. Mitchell lake looks much more kayak friendly. I do like Scugog, I just worry if the winds turn strongly North or South I could be in a lot of trouble."
728875,Acountdeleted,2012-09-11 00:47:00,2562,"Thanks again to everyone for the help. It was a good night, lots of panfish and Bass.  and walleye?    I didn't even know walleye were in this lake and I caught one off of a drop shot worm. Highlight of the night.  Back he goes to grow bigger for the next person. All in all a great little lake for a kayak. I'll be back again soon."
