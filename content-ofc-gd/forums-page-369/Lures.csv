728347,Steve2012,2012-09-08 14:29:00,15,Hi guys  Newb question here. Can anyone please tell me what type and color of lures are good for walleye trolling?  Thanks!
728349,SlowPoke,2012-09-08 14:36:00,2984,"That largely depends on where you are fishing. On Erie, copper back spoons and worm harnesses work well while on Quinte, body baits with purple and black seem to work well."
728351,kickingfrog,2012-09-08 14:45:00,8333,"Just about anything you can imagine could and would work, but many of us do have preferences for our own lakes.  The colour of the water and the amount of day light would also influence my decision on colour choice.  I mostly fish non-great lakes walleye and my first choice is natural bait colours, mostly perch and silver/black minnow, because those are the main bait fish available.  If it is low light then I'll use firetiger or a ""hot"" perch."
728356,bow slayer,2012-09-08 15:04:00,1074,"rapalas j-5 and j-7 in black/gold and chartuese have always worked well for me no matter what water body i have used them on. You may need to use something to get them deeper seeing they run very shallow on their own. Depending on depth i am fishing i use a 3/4 oz. bell sinker about 18 inches from lure for water less then 10 fow and then if trolling 10-20 fow 1 oz and a long lead. Anything over 20 fow i use a jet planer. I have also had good  luck with  deep diving shap raps and fat raps in perch,chartuese,blue/silver and black/gold. Also slow trolling a bottom bouncing warm harness with orange blades and a dew worm works good."
728357,Steve2012,2012-09-08 15:12:00,15,Ty everyone. It's much appreciated!
728358,GBW,2012-09-08 15:31:00,8460,trolling a worm harnes on most lakes should produce.  i prefer to cast though and because of that I get to use so much more and i find i get into more fish casting than trolling
728367,Roy,2012-09-08 16:08:00,13728,"As others have said, trolling for walleyes is most productive with worm harnesses or body baits. If you're not going to be using harnessed worms, minnows or leeches, the body baits should be of the long slender variety....something like ReefRunners in the 800 model. I don't think that actual colours mean a whole lot except that you should have dark and light on hand. Run your baits deeper than shallower. If there are floating or half submerged weeds, take a page out of the muskie guys' book by using a down rod. Most of the weeds will be caught by the rod and less time will be spent cleaning the bait, thus, more time in the strike zone.  I'm only a youngster but I hope this helps."
728370,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-08 16:32:00,336,By far the best lure for walleyes is the simple jig.    Tip a jig with a bit of crawler or a leach or minnow and you're set.  Walleye 101.
728372,jimmy v,2012-09-08 16:52:00,33,"An idea of where (lake name or general area) would generate more detailed info for you for sure.Example would be East end of Lake Erie worm harnesses are great whereas central Lake Erie copper backed Michigan Stingers and Knockout lures work well,good luck!"
728525,mercman,2012-09-09 16:46:00,7054,I am very sure that You know a certain `someone` who can answer that question for you in great detail.
728547,mike rousseau,2012-09-09 20:04:00,4661,"The ""best"" color changes throughout the year... And varies from spot to spot.... As well as day to day.... Morning and night... Sunny and cloudy... Warm and cold...Etc...  Some may say this isn't helpful information... But it is... Never be afraid to experiment with colors... Especially when your ON fish... That way you know active fish are seeing this new color...  My box has a LOT of different lures in a LOT of different colors... But generally I only use a few different lures in a few different colors...  As far as lures... Depth is key... Where you will be fishing mostly.... You'll be targetting 15-30 feet of water.... So you'll want crankbaits that dive at 15-20-25-30 feet for different spots... Lures that will dive 20 feet or so will be 90% of your arsenal... Stick with brand names like Rapala... Cotton Cordell... Reef runner... Manns... Yo zuri... They all work...  Also mentioned are worm harnesses.... These are a bit tougher to troll... But I'll show you to do it right when we get out....  And to start... Keep colors simple....  Black/gold Black/silver Blue/silver Perch Fire tiger  Again I'll show you some of my favorites when we go out...  Hope this helps  Mike"
