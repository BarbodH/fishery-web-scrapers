Looking at a Hobie Cat.  Some take 1-4 people.  Anybody have any experience with these?  If you buy used, is there tax owing?  thanks."

We own the Hobie ""Getaway"" and my neighbours have the ""Wave"" and I've been sailing both for years...great fun for the family and they are both perfect cottage boats.   I can't comment on tax/used boats but if you want to talk specifics about boats and what might meet your needs, feel free to shoot me a PM.  Here's a photo of our Getaway.   It's a bigger boat and you can load on 4-6 adults and/or a whole gaggle of kids.   The Wave is smaller - 4 adults would be it's maximum capacity.   Both boats are great for easy sailing with the family but can also be really pushed for some edge-of-your-seat sailing with a crew of two experienced boaters.  "
