728651,Jer,2012-09-10 13:33:00,1426,"Well the weather cleared on Saturday just in time for our 5pm ceremony at the Peterborough Curling Club. Along with the clearing skies, came some pretty significant winds for a short while.  While waiting at the altar for my beautiful bride, my Best Man mentions to me that he heard from our neighbour that a large tree had come down at our house shortly after the limo had picked me and my groomsmen up. My neighbour being somewhat of a joker, and my Best Man even more so, I figgered that it was some kind of ""fool the groom"" joke to ease the tension of the moment. I refused to believe and we all continued to eat, drink, dance and party the night away. A fabulous night was had by all.  At the end of it all, Sandra and I had a romantic limo ride home to find this in our driveway:            The driver earned his tip helping us with all our stuff through the tree and into the house.   Thankfully, I had parked our vehicles across the road earlier in the day to allow room for the limo. Otherwise they would have been totalled. The tree came down without damaging a thing, couldn't have been dropped on purpose any better.  So is this a good omen?  These pics were taken yesterday morning, with the help of the guys from the neighbourhood, it was all cut and cleared by the afternoon. Lotsa campfire wood, too bad it was spruce and no good for inside burning."

728658,Joey,2012-09-10 14:08:00,9122,I would say it is a good omen as you had moved the cars to make room for the limo and nobody was outside at the time as you were attending your wedding  Congrats Jer
