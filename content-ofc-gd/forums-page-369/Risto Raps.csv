728400,kickingfrog,2012-09-08 20:01:00,8333,I bought some of those when they first came out. I'll have a look in the repository.
728403,Snidley,2012-09-08 20:08:00,620,Call Frank at Bronte Outdoor 905-896-4009. He's got the Risto Raps on the wall (on sale or cheap I believe). I keep telling him to post them on a few websites and they would be gone allowing for some new stuff. I'm sure they are good lures as all Rapalas generally are and I have caught Walleyes and Smallmouth them myself.
728405,wall i,2012-09-08 20:33:00,48,    called Frank but he couldnt locate them ........ didnt seem to know what they were. Thanks in any event.
728408,Snidley,2012-09-08 20:53:00,620,I just talked to Frank and he has over 20 of them for $6.99. All sizes and probably most colours. If you can get one the big 7 or 9 are great in the Parrot colour for walleyes deep.
728413,kickingfrog,2012-09-08 21:27:00,8333,"Looks like I only have 2 left. I'm going to hang on to them, sorry. I may have to call Frank.  "
