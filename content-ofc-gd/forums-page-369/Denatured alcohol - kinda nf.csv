728321,MJL,2012-09-08 11:24:00,2427,Methyl hydrate. It's available at most hardware stores.  Angling Specialties also sells an epoxy solvent which cleans up epoxy well.
728336,Rodwrap,2012-09-08 13:16:00,130,Use plain ol' rubbing alcohol....
728365,adempsey,2012-09-08 16:06:00,1498,"Methyl Hydrate = Methanol Denatured Alcohol = Ethanol + Methanol (added so you can't drink it).  It also goes by the name Methylated Spirits. Rubbing Alcohol = Isopropanol + Water [and possibly some ethanol]   Using rubbing alcohol may be OK, but since it has water it might not work as well.  I only know the chemistry, I don't know anything about what you want to use it for."

728420,kickingfrog,2012-09-08 22:12:00,8333,I tried some alcohol that an old southern friend brought up from 'Bama to Lakair one year.  That stuff was about as far removed from nature as you could get.  You're also wise to take an extra big step back from the night time fire when the jug comes around.
