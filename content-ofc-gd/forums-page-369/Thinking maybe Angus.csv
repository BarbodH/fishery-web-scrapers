613925,Lokka,2011-08-21 01:09:00,32,Never really fished a river for salmon.. just a little bit on Lake O.. this year will be my first. I hoping to get out long weekend of Sept if the winds are too high for my little boat on Lake O. Maybe i'll see some of you guys out there.
613989,bigredfisher,2011-08-21 14:01:00,300,Go to the mouth of pine on notty and ask for erine . Hes normally down there pretty early (4 am) every day. Very nice man. You can also pick ur pass up at the hardware store
614027,misfish,2011-08-21 15:55:00,29133,"Went for a drive today. Angus area real muddy,further up clearer but seen no movement of salmon. Need some cooler nights,but it,s not looking like it with whats been forcast."
614127,davey buoy,2011-08-21 22:49:00,5505,"Spent about 8 hours in a boat with a friend north of the marsh Saturday, and not one single sighting of a salmon yet. Guess the evening temps have not been cool enough to trigger anything of late?"
614162,bigredfisher,2011-08-22 01:19:00,300,Yep I have seen a couple but nothing much at all. I have also been there everyday to see if a good push has come in . Well not yet lol and I mean I'm down there EVERY DAY
614166,Swan_Dive,2011-08-22 01:23:00,46,I have a big job interview tomorrow so once this stress is behind me I am going to hit the rivers hard to try and get my first salmon on the fly. Hopefully the weather will help with the run sooner than later  Swany

727760,ch312,2012-09-06 14:25:00,1590," out of curiosity, why do you feel the need to post your senseless comments in migrating salmon related threads? this may be news to you, but this is a fishing website where people are encouraged to talk about fishing."
727762,misfish,2012-09-06 14:48:00,29133,"  Yes it is,you are correct,BUT,location is not allowed,according to the OFC rule book. So said area, is not a big area,it,s pretty much ,PIN POINT."
727763,BillM,2012-09-06 15:08:00,17367," Really?  This is a fishing website?  If you aren't smart enough to figure out that these threads lead to nothing but spot burning and more pressure then any river needs, I really don't know what to tell you slick.  Here's a thought, let's talk about your home river and the amount of Tim Hortons cups, garbage and 50lb braid you get to wade through after the salmon crowd is done with the river.  I realize Dave meant no harm with his post, but unfortunately all he's doing is feeding the idiots that use this site for nothing more then information gathering, adding nothing to the community at all.  That being said, I'll happily give Dave info that should help him get into a few fish.."
727768,craigdritchie,2012-09-06 15:36:00,1586,"All I know is that I will enjoy spending some time at my new favourite spot next week. Won't say precisely where it is, but fish are definitely in and, because it won't be crowded, fishing will be spectacular!  :-)"
727771,ehg,2012-09-06 16:00:00,2666," Ya, this thread was started 13 months ago and the replies were friendlier then.  People fished more 25 yrs. ago pre-internet. Wilmot or Ganaraka, etc... were busier back then. I would count 90 boats on spot at Pigeon Lake Sat. night 25 yrs.ago. Now there might be half dozen same spot Sat. night.  Despite whoever, whatever the salmon are still migrating same spots as then. Generally they die after being upriver a bit."
727841,ch312,2012-09-06 19:27:00,1590, i'm fully aware of what you're saying. i was simply pointing out the fact that you make senseless posts in nearly all of the migratory salmon threads and was wondering why you feel the need to keep doing so. i think we got the point 6-7 threads ago
727851,davey buoy,2012-09-06 19:43:00,5505,"You guys sure dig up old threads. Knowing what I know now would never of posted that thread. I have learned a lot over the last year or so. I will never even name a river as I was flamed for that a while. Never mind a location. Learned the hard way and so be it.I will contribute the best I can giving no locations. By the way ,thanks Bill."

727923,12footspringbok,2012-09-06 22:22:00,459, The one thing I know for sure is you will learn more on the river bank than internet fishing forums...
727924,davey buoy,2012-09-06 22:24:00,5505,  :worthy:Best advice yet!!!
727935,misfish,2012-09-06 22:44:00,29133," Very true words.  Sit back, watch and learn.See what others are doing. Look close how they have their  shot set up.What they are using,and how.  When I started to pin,I watched, and asked questions of other anglers.  At this local,you may get shot down,but worth asking."
611672,davey buoy,2011-08-12 18:56:00,5505,"Thinking of heading to Angus tomorrow,one would think the initial first run should be moving up in my past experiences, 2nd to 3rd week of August is typically my best time.Anyone know what's happening if anything this past week? Thanks Davey. ."
611704,LefroyFisherman,2011-08-12 21:04:00,602,"I was thinking the same thing, last year it was this early but probably because of all the rain... not so sure if they would be there yet this year."
611707,davey buoy,2011-08-12 21:40:00,5505,The higher amount of rain would make it easier for the run up if anything. Also the cooler last couple of nights shouldn't hurt either I would think.
611711,LefroyFisherman,2011-08-12 21:58:00,602,"yeah I know the rain makes it easier, last year we got a pile of rain though, they might be there"

611719,misfish,2011-08-12 22:49:00,29133,"The river never got low all year. Lots of rain in the spring and the summer kept it above norm. The notty is known to have early runs then norm. It may be worth a look,but it looked dirty to me still."
611724,davey buoy,2011-08-12 22:58:00,5505," I seem to think that river is almost always dirty,on a good day I find you can only see about 2-3' from shore.Somehow the fish seem to see well enough."
611726,LefroyFisherman,2011-08-12 23:06:00,602,I've never seen it all that clear
611730,misfish,2011-08-12 23:28:00,29133,"Well if you fish the Angus area,you will never see it clear. Thats why I fish other spots that are not mud bottoms."
611897,davey buoy,2011-08-13 19:28:00,5505,"Well about 3hrs in to the morning I caught a 7lb salmon. What a fight, forgot about the early ones with a ton of energy.Saw a few jumping, but was surprised about the early bird fisherman this year. Looks like a good start to a new fall."

613887,Swan_Dive,2011-08-20 19:46:00,46,"Just a question to you guys that fish the Angus area, what is the deal with the seperate fishing permit for the Essa Township area?  I have heard that you need one while fishing on Essa property but have not really look into it.  I have just avoided the area because I did not want to get in trouble.  Where would I go to get information on this or to get a permit?  Any help with this would be appreciated  Swany"
613889,J-M,2011-08-20 20:37:00,65,"Talk to Essa Township. Basically. They charge a fishing permit ($40) to fish on any of Essa Township public lands in and around the Angus area which backs onto the Nottawasaga river. The permit includes a ticket to fish the annual salmon derby that takes place near the end of Sept. I know a lot fishermen who think the permit system is Bull considering its public lands. The positive side is a large portion of that money has and will be used to rehabilitate the river, they've hosted a volunteer riverside tree plant, they've installed fish cleaning tables, and recently installed a covered picnic area for families and fishermen.  The way I see it, if that money is used to rehabilitate the river and improve the salmon and trout populations, I'm all for it! The Nottawasaga Valley Conservation is always looking for rehabilitation money.....  JM Fishingsimcoe.com"
613914,Swan_Dive,2011-08-21 00:10:00,46,"J-M, thank you for the help, the permit sounds like it is worth it and is going to a good cause.  I will talk to essa Township and hopefully be out there fishing in the near future.  Thanks again  Swany"
