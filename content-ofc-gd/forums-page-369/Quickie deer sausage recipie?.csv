728466,Dara,2012-09-09 02:12:00,3052,I have just ended up with a couple of unexpected deer and would like a quick sausage recipie.  I have to finish cutting these in the next couple of days.  SWMBO does not want them in the fridge forever  If anybody has the portions of fat to pork to deer I would appreciate it.  Thanks

728469,Dara,2012-09-09 02:29:00,3052,Thankyou but I'm looking for more of a breakfast sausage type thing. I just have a baby hand grinder for now and not a lot of time or places to hang that sausage.
728476,tb4me,2012-09-09 03:12:00,3295,"if your going to grind n stuff 2 deer and some pork by hand,to make sausages, you best book a month off of work..lol Your going to need a good industrial grinder and a decent sausage stuffer."
728482,Ron,2012-09-09 04:24:00,1683," You know, with the proper size bolt (threaded rod 3/8"" I believe) you can easily convert your hand grinder to an electric drill grinder....  The last time I did up sausage, we went with a 60-30 mixture. However, we used cheap cut fatty pork butt roast instead of straight pork fat. Substitute 50% of water added with 50% stewing tomatoes as well. Instead of makeing sausage links, we made patties.  Cheers, Ron..."

Fooled around with smaller quantities on our own, but 1 time we have that amount and went commercial, can't begin to imagine doing that amount on my own with small hand tools."
728544,Leecher,2012-09-09 19:53:00,7832,"Dara,  I don't have the recipe per say, but the ones we use to make (friends recipe - deer sausage) would put equal parts of mince pork to equal parts of mince deer...  The last few years, I get pepperettes done at a local butcher shop... same measurements for the guys recipe, equal parts of pork to equal parts of deer meat.  Tjunkie"
