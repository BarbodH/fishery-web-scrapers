727800,skeeter99,2012-09-06 18:01:00,109,anyone been to elephant or baptiste lake lately heading up friday and wondering what the mood was of the local bass population thanks in advance Troy
727807,jedimaster,2012-09-06 18:16:00,3472,"Not this year, the two tournies normally on that lake were cancelled this year due to the selling of the lodge on elephant. I would think the bass would be getting fat this time of year."
727969,Ainsley,2012-09-07 00:26:00,142,I grew up fishing baptiste every summer. My dad worked at a camp in the north east end as a kid too.  Didn't get a chance to get up there this year tho as my son was just born in July.
728159,mirogak,2012-09-07 16:03:00,387,Went back in June and there was bass fishing in the channels between Benoir and Elephant.  Saw lots of people fishing in those channels but watch out for shallow areas and tree trunks.  I bumped into a couple myself.  Have fun M
728161,GBW,2012-09-07 16:11:00,8460,I was going to say the same about the shallows.  they would be really shallow this year for sure.  I haven't been in a few years to offer anything else though.
