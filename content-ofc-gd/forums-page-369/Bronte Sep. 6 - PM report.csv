Flies and spoons all fired....55-65 feet down....2.5-2.7 mph at the ball....down temp was about 60 degrees 8/12 for the 1.5 hrs of fishing wasn't bad No pictures this time as it was busy when the bite was hot and then it got too dark for the blackberry.... Nice even though short evening trip...Will do some more later in the month, plenty of fish still around...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

I finally got my boat in the water last Sunday (yes it has not seen any action this year). Big waves and they kept getting bigger out to deeper water. Ran some gas through the boat and headed back in but when I puttered out to 200 FOW the screen lit up with bait and marks. It was too rough for me to drop a line but maybe this weekend"
