728607,Nipfisher,2012-09-10 02:00:00,2449,I am registered for a course at the Kempenfelt Conference Centre in Innisfil from Oct. 1st - 5th. There are 3 of us from work attending together and I was hoping to find a cheap cabin along Simcoe to rent that will sleep 3 guys comfortably. I am hoping that there will be some good prices as the summer season has ended. Anywhere in the Innisfil area will do and it doesn't have to be on the water as we will be attending the course every day from 8am to 5pm and there would be little (if any) time for fishing.   Hoping one of our Simcoe members can help me out.   Reply in this thread or PM me.
