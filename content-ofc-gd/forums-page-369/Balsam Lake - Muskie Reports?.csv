We will probably go to the usual spots, but curious on what the activity has been like......and of course if you want to share some locations, I suppose I would have to take a look at them....  .  Will share what we find.  Either way I am looking forward to it."
727941,Skud,2012-09-06 23:15:00,739,"Them musky fisherman are a real tight lipped crew. Not to worry Adam, I am going to pull out the `go to` lure and slay those critters."
727950,Skud,2012-09-06 23:37:00,739,Go to kawarthaanglers.com forum and read up on all the reports for Balsam. Got to register though
727977,Handlebarz,2012-09-07 00:42:00,3790,It's hard to get info on smaller lakes but usually get general info. Good luck out there
728121,hutch4113,2012-09-07 13:14:00,374," Ya...but I have fished with you before.  I don't think any of your go to lures work.....muahahahahahaahahaha.  I am looking forward to the friendly competition between the Brothers......  By the way, probably heading down to Bass Pro on Saturday, if you are interested."
