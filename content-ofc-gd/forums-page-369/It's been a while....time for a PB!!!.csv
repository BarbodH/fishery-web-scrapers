727687,johnnyb,2012-09-06 02:21:00,3413,"Well I have had a couple successful outings for bass over the last few weeks, but have just been too busy to come online and post about them.  Heck, I've been too busy to even come online and look at what the rest of you are all up to these days.  So, here's the rundown:  After about 20 years, I finally started using the flippin rod I bought for actual flippin!  I was surprised at how sensitive it was and handled fish great....for a long time I used the rod as a pike/muskie stick before putting it away.  I'm super glad I brushed off the dust and figured out the joys of dragging a jig through heavy cover  These pics are from 2 quick outings on a Saturday/Sunday in Muskoka....only got out for about 2 hours each time....but definitely feel like I have confidence in the new technique  Excuse the pics....a lot of them were taken by me, on the phone.  All fish were released healthy...hopefully to be found even bigger at a later date.              Not too shabby....but still not the highlight of my recent bass outings  This past weekend, I was at the cottage and was delighted to be out fishing with my son more than once.  He has really been down on fishing over the last few years, to the point where I had kind of given up on trying to get him out.  He would come along occasionally....and on our family vacation discovered dropshotting.  Since then, he's been picking a rod up on his own, and a lot more eager to come with me.  In fact, when he's not dropshotting, he's asking to use what is now his ""favourite"" reel....my curado 201 E.  And the kid is GOOD with it...amazing.  We did a bit of scouting on Gull Lake this past Saturday, as my cousin Bicephalic was going to come up for the day on Sunday for some long awaited fishing together.  Well....the scouting trip was our best day for QUALITY as I ran into a bass I've been searching for for many years...my PB!  The following Sunday was full of decent smallies, but nothing insane....and on the Monday, my son outfished me!  I'm just so proud of him!!!  Here are the pics:  My big bad bass.....personal best for me at 5lbs 11oz:  (Yes I'm posting a weight.  No, I don't care if you don't believe me    )       My son, deep in concentration on his dropshot setup    And the payoff!    Bicephalic showin that he can still throw down....we caught quite a few of these on the Sunday....and watched fish twice their size chasing them....couldn't get those tanks to commit though.     Biggest bass of the day goes to the new superstar     Sorry for my absence on the board as of late....hope you all are doing well!  See you on the water"
727694,TDunn,2012-09-06 02:43:00,680,Awesome! And I totally believe you on the weight!
727700,Cudz,2012-09-06 03:15:00,2652,I am calling Bull on the weight.  Maybe 5 pounds 10 and half ounces. JK! LOL!  Nice Hawg! Congrats on the PB!
727702,Kerry,2012-09-06 03:44:00,383,Big smallies are awesome for their fight but a big bucket coming up mouth first can put the biggest smile on your face in a hurry can't it? Beauty fish and it sure is good to see a kid following in his dad's footsteps! Kerry
