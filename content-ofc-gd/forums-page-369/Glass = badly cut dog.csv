728249,Rustic-Fisher,2012-09-07 23:47:00,826,"Thanks to the idiots that were shooting beer bottles in the simcoe forest I've got a dog ( whom lives and breaths bird hunting) that will miss half the season with a severely severed front foot. A week in a half before openner ughhhhhhhh. That's my rant, sorry guys. Careful with your dogs out there. R"
728251,Christopheraaron,2012-09-07 23:50:00,3525,Ouch! Send him my wishes!
728259,woodenboater,2012-09-08 00:02:00,2277,"damn that's terrible news and I hope your dog has a full and speedy recovery.  As for the tools that left broken glass in the bush, they should be rounded up and made to run barefoot through their mess."
728264,Joey,2012-09-08 00:05:00,9122,That's just terrible.  The young punks in the park near me leave broken bottles around all the time too.  Gotta watch so Ralphie doesn't cut his paws too!!!
728281,Jer,2012-09-08 01:00:00,1426,"I hope he didn't split the pad too bad. My dog split his pad real bad one time, I don't really know how, but it took almost six months, two re-stitchings before he could go in the water again. He missed a whole summer. He was real trooper though, put up with a fully bandaged and socked paw the whole time, never pulled at it once."
728295,largemouthtrout,2012-09-08 02:36:00,53,"That really sucks about your dogs foot , I never liked bottles . They shoulda stopped making them years and years ago .  Can you say union ?  Thats why cans cost more than bottles , and probably why beer bottles still exist . It would be an interesting fact to know , how many people , in the last 50 years , have gone to the hospital becuase of broken beer bottles ."
728307,motv8tr,2012-09-08 05:16:00,2587,"I'm sorry to hear that, some people are ... Hope your pup heals fast.. Maureen"
728310,pics,2012-09-08 07:48:00,1268,How about blaming the dumbasses who break the bottles? Glass can be reused many times while aluminum only once. Its very energy intensive to make cans as well..The union comment is just plain stupid....
728333,NAW,2012-09-08 13:11:00,4022,Very sorry to here about your dog.  He's going to be supper bummed out that he can't go hunting with you this year.
728338,Ralph Field,2012-09-08 13:37:00,1018,"I hate it whenever I hear that a pet has been injured. Some people do not respect other peoples property . Throwing trash, breaking bottles, destroying signs ,etc. seem to be on the rise which implies parents and educators need to do more to curtail these acts. I hope your dog recovers quickly and doesn't suffer any more pain."
728339,misfish,2012-09-08 14:01:00,29133,That sucks Ryan.Sorry to hear that bud.
728343,bigbuck,2012-09-08 14:08:00,2449,I hope that Karma bites those knobs in the rear end.
728364,Sinker,2012-09-08 16:01:00,8692,That really sucks!! There is nothing worse than broken glass!! Why are some people such idiots??  I hope you picked up the glass??  S.
728369,Fish Farmer,2012-09-08 16:32:00,2234,"My thought to Pics Sorry about your Dog, hope he gets better. But he could have cut himself on anything. I've seen old garbage dumped in the bush with broken bottles and rusty cans. Still idiots leaving stuff like that any place."
728381,tightline,2012-09-08 17:16:00,322,"2 summers ago my Sheppard had her main pad on her front foot cut almost in half by a broken beer bottle some idiot smashed on the river bank!!! Some peoples children I tell ya, no respect!!!  Hope your hound recovers in time to get out for the end of the season, shes probably as heartbroken about it as you are!"
728398,davey buoy,2012-09-08 19:12:00,5505,Sorry to hear that Ryan.One of my dogs also cut there pad once. What a long time to heal. I'm sure he/she will make a full recovery!
728402,nofish4me,2012-09-08 20:03:00,404,"Bummer, I was at a party not too long ago, well, maybe 20 years ago.  I made a couple of fellers get in the creek and pick up thier broken beer bottles.  Not a good sight, but they did it. I always hope they remember that incident."
728473,Rustic-Fisher,2012-09-09 02:54:00,826,"Nope it was glass, seen exactly where it happened. Glass is still there. I didn't have a chance to pick it up as the dog hit an artery and was bleeding good.  He's little sore today but doesn't seemed to bothered by it. I'm sure he'll be pointing birds by mid to late Oct. Thanks R"
728624,ch312,2012-09-10 02:54:00,1590,that sucks that you've joined the club. 2 years ago my lab had to get 7 staples thanks to broken glass.
728669,shane,2012-09-10 14:41:00,652,"This is why I think that it should be a $1.00 deposit on beer bottles. But every time I bring this up, I get the crap beat out of me. Hope your dog has a quick and easy recovery."
