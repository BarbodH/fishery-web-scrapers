After three years of owning my boat and fishing countless numbers of unknown water bodies, I'm surprised it hasnt happend sooner.  But regardless, it has me looking for a new prop. Honda's spec for my motor call for a 9â…ž"" x 12""  http://marine.honda.com/Products/modeldetail/BF30  But when I went in to a locate marine shop, they tried to sell me a 10 1/2"" x 11"" saying it was the right prop for my motor. I know you can play around with it a little with the dia. and pitch, and your RPMs come into play. I've done alot of googling and reading, but I've yet to come across an article that clears it up.  Also, how do I deal with a motor without an RPM gauge.  This motor is on a fairly heavy 16' Lund. Full floor and casting deck, no console, trolling motor and single 12v batterie up front, two passengers with gear and a full livewell. I get about 30 km/h. I dont care about my hole shot, I just want to bring up the top end a little.  Thanks, any help or links are apreciated.  EDIT: The fishing was great by the way..."

687262,LucG,2012-04-17 00:55:00,779,"Thanks!  I've read that if the rpms are too high, move up in pitch, and if they are too low move down in pitch.  In my opinion, my motor seem to run kind of low rpms at full throttle."
687316,ecmilley,2012-04-17 02:25:00,2163,"don't fool yourself into believing that the rpm was low, the hondas run very quiet and without a tach do not guess, there is not a lot of wiggle room there, i would advise ev en putting a inductive timing light with tach option to get your wot rpm better safe than a connecting rod hanging out the block"
