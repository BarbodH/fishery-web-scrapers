687509,vance,2012-04-17 17:17:00,719,"A friend of mine just sent me this,I wonder how much they cost   vance"
687511,BillM,2012-04-17 17:22:00,17367,I don't wanna know what that costs.
687515,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-17 17:30:00,10439," But I want one!!!!  I know the currently available track kits are in somewhere in the $15K range. Yeah, I checked."
687516,vance,2012-04-17 17:35:00,719,I have been thinking since I posted and I wonder how skis on the front wheels and tracks on the back wheels(locking diff)would work  that way I wouldn't need to buy a new 4wd truck.   vance
687529,ratherboutdoors,2012-04-17 17:59:00,132,Unstoppable!
687640,skidoosafari,2012-04-17 21:00:00,46,Now that is COOL. Imagine getting stuck ya just don't have your buddy grab the front ski an giver a tug while you gun the throttle. Lol
687653,woodenboater,2012-04-17 21:19:00,2277,WANT !
687665,misfish,2012-04-17 21:41:00,29133,Amagine what a FORD could do with that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
687672,Joeytier,2012-04-17 21:49:00,3990,"Aside from being expensive [i can only assume] and very bulky to transport, that is AWESOME."
687674,Roy,2012-04-17 21:50:00,13728," Yeah, it could break down a lot farther into the bush eh?"
687676,glen,2012-04-17 21:54:00,2641,Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha  Roy
687677,Tybo,2012-04-17 21:56:00,1373, It still wouldn`t get that far in.
687678,glen,2012-04-17 21:57:00,2641,Buy an argo instead.
687681,misfish,2012-04-17 21:59:00,29133," I was needling Paul,,,,,,,,,,,,,   I see you take offence as well   .Im going back to my party,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,."
687682,bdox,2012-04-17 22:03:00,329,"Looks alright, but i'd prefer the hub mounted ones.   If you look closely @ 52 seconds you can see it getting stuck before they cut to the next scene."
687701,limeyangler,2012-04-17 23:12:00,5204,OMG!!!!.....the lakes i could access!  Awesome...thanx for posting vance.
687706,Rod Caster,2012-04-17 23:27:00,5784,I don't know if my Mazda has the HP to even move those things haha.  Pretty cool though  Boivin is a good innovator to say the least
687718,Fisherman,2012-04-17 23:48:00,7201,"Unless you're the only one driving it, forget about them, we had two trucks equipped with them, more time in the shop than on the trail.  However, they were fords.  You couldn't tell the drivers not to turn the steering wheel without forward or backward motion, the power steering units got fried.  They are something for soft ground."
