687318,bushart,2012-04-17 02:29:00,2628,"Pretty sure Nippising's walleye numbers are changed little by Spring fishing by 1st Nations--which has occured for time and eternity  It would be interesting to know the numbers speared today and say the numbers from the 40' or 50's  Likely they're close  My point is---Nippising was hit hard from many sides until it broke (commercial and sports angling)--it was the ""Go To"" place for Southern Ontario for many years  Now the big target is what has been consistent for hundreds of years --stands out as unfair as changes had to be made to curb the onslaught that was brought on.  Maybe--just maybe---our windows are dirty"
687323,Joeytier,2012-04-17 02:38:00,3990,"I sure do, and I am one of them.  It irks me that my license fees are consistently increased while MNR funding decreases...whoever thinks that large scale compliance with fishing regs is the norm is flat out wrong as far as I'm concerned.  All the while Native Canadians deem themselves worthy of special limits [i do not mean to generalize, but this is what native communities continue to fight for] in the name of cultural preservation, only to sell it right it back to the 'invasive' European man.  I'd be very interested in some statistics as to how many of these fish are used for 'ceremonial purposes'.  It is agreed upon by most everyone that the inherent issue is the 'us vs. them' mentality of first nations vs. MNR, but how can you not expect that to persist when you have two wildly different sets of regulations."
687324,Nipfisher,2012-04-17 02:47:00,2449,"  Since the 40s and 50s the walleye population and fishery in general has been brought to a shadow of what it once was. Now this has to do with pressure on the fishery. By sport anglers, natives, and environment. So what we take now hyas far more of an impact on the sustainability of the fishery."
687328,manitoubass2,2012-04-17 03:06:00,11391,Conservation of the resource trumps everything.  At least that is what is written in the agreements.  But I am not the one to say if the resource is hurting because of the acts of the local Natives    
687332,mike rousseau,2012-04-17 03:24:00,4661,  Hahahaha....  Love it...
687335,manitoubass2,2012-04-17 03:34:00,11391,"and thanks for the added input crosshairs,  But I'm going to strongly disagree with you on the topic of identifying walleye gender.  And it's not that I'm saying Natives shouldn't target females alone, but under guidelines and the protection of the fishery, neither should be targeted during the spawning period IMO"
687340,blarg,2012-04-17 04:21:00,289," Invasive species...i wont bother to comment, too ridiculous, but you bring up the point about poaching, as did crosshair, but of course all of the native harvest is accounted for, all controlled, and no doubt if someone steps over the line they are 'punished', sure they are.  The whole thing is a sham."
687357,Billy Bob,2012-04-17 11:14:00,5865,"Looking at this from A FAR all I can say is Nipissing at one time had a GREAT reputation down here......MANY anglers would drive the 7-8 hours to spend a long weekend or week on Lake Nipissing.......I no longer hear anyone making that trip......why....well the word has been out for some time now that the lake just doesn't produce enough walleyes to make it worth while.....now we have this other lake that was basically in the same shape as Nipissing when Nipissing was producing......it's called Lake Erie.....all the states on this side of the boarder bought out and or banned the gill nets....Lake Erie now produces good catches of walleyes again.....does anyone here see a parallel with these two lakes...  My next question to Crosshairs would be, if the walleye fishing completely crashes on Lake Nipissing, do the natives have rights to move on to another lake......."
687384,glen,2012-04-17 12:59:00,2641,I went ice fishing on Nip and i caught one small walleye for the whole three days. There was five people in my group and they didnt catch any.
687407,Nipfisher,2012-04-17 13:41:00,2449,  There were groups that caught 15-20 walleye per day and 50-100 perch per day. Depends on where you were fishing and if the outfitter (hut owner) was on the fish.   I am expecting to have an excellent summer of walleye fishing on Nip as I learned a few things last year that should help with my success. Most likly smaller walleye but better #s.
687408,crosshairs,2012-04-17 13:41:00,55," Nipissing FN can hunt and fish anywhere within their treat area and traditional territory. NFN's treaty area is from sault ste marie, north to the water shed, east to ottawa river and south to lake simco. Traditional territory goes as far north as lake nipigon and south to OKA. There is documentation which shows families traditionally using these areas. An example would be Garden River of sault ste marie, could come and set nets in lake nippissing, as with any other FN in the robinson huron treaties. Each treaty has different wording, the williams will be different from the robinsons.  NFN has been fishing lake Nippissing for over 9400 years, I don't think they are moving anywhere. If the fishery crashes they are stuck here, outfitters will move on to another location. The first nation has the support from the local municipalities, north bay, west nipissing, st.charles, french river, calandar. Collectively, as one voice they are hoping to get the government to put the money that is needed to properly manage Lake nip in to it. There will be a report written with all the comments etc from the lake nipissing summit held april 3&4 in the comming weeks. Check out the website. www.lakenipissingsummit.ca. I believe all the presentations will also be available on the website. There is a really good by Fred Bellfeuille, on the legal side of things.  Commercially NFN can only fish Nipissing, that is where their court case was won. If they were able to prove through the courts that they commercially fished other lakes they could take that approach."
687416,Nipfisher,2012-04-17 14:00:00,2449,"  The commercial harvest target is about 46,000 kg a year according to NFN.   IF NFN is only actually catching less then 20,000 kgs per year why not drop the target to 30,000. It would ""go-over"" well with the public. 101 thousand pounds of walleye hurts my ears alot more then 66 thousand pounds."
687421,crosshairs,2012-04-17 14:09:00,55," NFN has reduced their quota by 10% twice, So they are around 35000 kgs. They are following some scientifically acceptable model recognized world wide. It dictates what happens in certain circumstances. And I am NOT a biologist, just sharing what info I have. But it has been proven that Traditional Ecological Knowledge is needed by scientist (biologists) to help them do what they do. So people maybe not be biologists but they have alot of knowledge the biologists want."
687440,manitoubass2,2012-04-17 14:30:00,11391,"Crosshairs,  Throughout your involvement in the FN commercial fishing and tracking the data has there been any voiced concerns over targeting spawning fish?  I'm sure you can understand where I'm coming from here. If you harvest fish and promote the protection of the resource (which is paramount), it would make sense to close fishing for the spawning period.  I still don't like the method of spearing fish and guessing the gender, but at least the overall numbers are much smaller than netting. But a method where untargeted fish could be safely released would be very respectful towards the fishery.  Where I live (RRFN) there isn't a closed season in which I am aware of, even for the walleye spawn. But out of respect for the resource and the creator, you won't find people targeting spawning fish.  Anyhow, thanks again for taking your time to contribute to a valid discussion    "
687463,Billy Bob,2012-04-17 15:36:00,5865, Getting governments to do the right thing is not always a easy thing to accomplished.....and mind you I don't have the back ground of what the dividing line is with regular Canadian citizens and the Native Canadian citizens...but if it's anything like down here where the natives do NOT contribute in any tax base because they live on the res but then want the benefits from the tax base....well that's a hard sell wouldn't you think....and IMHO that is something that keeps us divided and is a barrier from being united to not only benefit ourselves but also the environment. And many politicians on both side of the issue like it this way.....believe it or not.
687060,rob v,2012-04-16 17:46:00,535,This I just found funny to read -   “conservation-minded” spear harvesters try to focus on males.
687062,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 17:48:00,11391,"Nipfisher (and others).  When fish are being harvested in a negative/harmful manner, it can still be reported.  I'd suggest making some phone calls and asking questions to the right people, and getting educated on the laws. So you know what means to approach to protect the fishery.  Just because a person is Native, does not give them the right to fish with dynamite, so to speak.  I know this is a touchy subject, but alot of this is based on ignorance."
687066,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 18:00:00,2449,  Bill the walleye index for mature walleye has been down for 3 consecutive years. There were alot of smaller walleye caught this year but that is in relation to the change in mesh size on their nets.
687067,BillM,2012-04-16 18:01:00,17367, Gotcha.
687071,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 18:05:00,2449,"  MB2, I feel I am quite knowlegeable on the resources and fishing pressure on Lake Nipissing. I am also very understanding as well. I love this lake and I love fishing it. The fish are still there and you can still do well but you have to work for them. That is what I like doing. Going out and drifting/trolling to find the fish then trying to get them to bite. I have spoken to NFN peoples and administration in the past about illegal nets, band members selling live fish, and spearing. THey deal with thier people in their traditional manner. Through a justice circle. Those who are caught netting during the spawn are shamed by the community."
687077,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-16 18:10:00,0,"i wholeheartedly believe when we start treating our first nations better on the whole, they will be less militant about protecting out of date harvesting rights."
687084,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 18:24:00,11391,"Nipfisher,  I didn't mean for that post to make it sounds like you weren't educated on your home waters, sorry if you took it that way.  I can totally understand your worries towards your fishery, I'd be offended as an angler if you didn't, lol.  What I meant though, was that there are tons of little laws in the Indian act that alot of people are not aware of, it's def. not common knowledge.  One thing I want fellow anglers to understand, is that a status card IS NOT providing a right to abuse the fishery. I know alot of people believe that ""status"" allows Native Americans to fish and hunt and keep whatever they want, and thats just not true. Of course, some of this stems from ignorance of the laws on all parts, including CO""s.  It is my understanding Nipfisher (and I may be wrong?), but under the Indian act, a reservation may NOT make by-laws of their own in regards to the preservation, protection and management of fur-bearing animals, fish and other game on the reserve; And the means of harvesting fish must be done in a manner that doesn't harm the fishery, nor abuse the resource. So yeah, anyhow, I think your totally in the right here for being concerned about this issue. I think it's wrong of them to target spawning fish, with a spear nonetheless. I'd be making some phone calls if I were you to see what can be done. Native or not, this is not productive to any fishery, and is blatant overharvesting IMO, by a means that does not respect the resource."
687088,Headhunter,2012-04-16 18:35:00,5703,"I believe that when everyone is treated equally, then we will not have any of these issues... HH"
687089,Lip-ripper,2012-04-16 18:38:00,228,"  That's part of the issue as well. In the past, natives didn't use halogen headlights, neoprene hip waders and factory made metal spear tips. Back then I'd assume using a hand-made spear, while hunting by torchlight and standing in the lake in the beginning of April. Might be a tad bit tougher than today. Don't even get me started talking about nylon gill nets, boats and outboards.  I have no problem with native traditions and rights continuing, I just think it would be more in-line to have them use traditional methods as well."
687097,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 18:54:00,11391," The traditional methods would not include much of spearing IMO, but rather fashioned nets made with pounded wood. I could be wrong as to the specific band/tribe, but I doubt it. Traditional methods of hunting and fishing were to use the easiest, most efficient way to harvest the animal or fish. A traditional Native would not have purposely harvested female fish during a spawn, as it goes against everything they stood for. Same reason as I would think that spears were not used for fishing purposes.  What is being done here I think is learned ignorance. That is the only way I could see them using a poor method of catch, during a spawning period. If I'm right, this is probably something that is relatively new, and not traditional.  Thats the only way I can see it, because it makes no sense at all.  And those limits need to be dealt with, 20 fish per day is too much, regardless of the method used.  I agree with the points your making though, it's a tad absurd to use such methods to catch fish.   Edit: I'm wrong. Certain tribes indeed spear fished as a main source of food. I'm speaking with a local Elder and he says fish that were easily smoked were the main targets(suckers/sturgeon). Which I guess makes sense as the food would be easier preserved for longer periods."
687128,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 19:46:00,2449,"  There nets can catch 50 to 100 fish daily and they are allowed 4 nets. I have seen a boat pull in with nets and coolers. Coolers heald over 160 walleye. Mixed in were bass, pike, sheepshead, and perch.  They set up an assembly line and process the fish right in plain view. Some who are registered will take it to the processing plant on reserve.  The commercial harvest target is about 46,000 kg a year (101,412 lbs.) , but it would be 66,000 kg (145,505 lbs.) if the fishery was at its potential.    One point I made earlier is that I have been offered and saw live walleye swimming in an aerated chest freezer. Now that is just plain illegal unless ""you are on reserve"" ."
687139,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 20:10:00,11391,"   The 4 net rule you mention there, is that for residents of the reserve? Or for commercial fishing purpose?  Also, I'd like to hear Clayton Goulais  thoughts on how anyone is determining the sex of the fish before spearing??? Are they guessing based off size? Or is there some other method I'm not aware of?     "
687141,Spiel,2012-04-16 20:15:00,9065, 
687208,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 22:21:00,2449,"Clayton Goulais  I believe the 4 net rule is per fisherman. Therefor any band member with a boat or access to one. Band members do not have to be registered with the band but they encourage it and there are benefits to registering. Fish caught by registered commercial fisherman and processed at the NFN processing plant are ""Certified Nipissing Walleye"" and sold in 2 local shops run by NFN for $14 per pound. Some of the unregistered fishermen sell walleye for $3-$6 per fish right out of their homes.  I have sent a message to Clayton. He has not been on here yet this year."
687247,crosshairs,2012-04-17 00:15:00,55,"Good evening all, i see there is alot of questions and personal opinions mentioned in here. Alot of these questions were answered at the lake nipissing summit, which a report will be completed shortly for everyone to view.  As mentioned by many of the people at the summit, NFN numbers (catch) hold 100% more weight than the numbers created by the OMNR by their ""creel census"". we have 20 Commercial fisherman on 10 boats, I see them 4 times a week, 80 % of them must drive by my house with their boat when going out, they are audited, catch forms are mandatory not like the joke of Creels. So if tested in court the only numbers in question are the anglers numbers. Everything NFN does is well documented, they are preparing to have a very very loud voice in the management of lake nipissing. Tourist outfitters at the summit were the ones to question the creel, also they had great concerns reguarding the enforcement of angers regulations. CO's on the lake are unheard of were the comments from an outfitter. Pretty scary. And I don't blame the OMNR, they are doing what they can as we are.  Now anyone who has ever speared walleye for any period of time can clearly tell a female from a male. Females do spawn at a later age than males, so yes size does help, also depending on the timing the females don't sit on the shoals until they are ready to spawn. They will  stage in a little deeper water until they are ready. The actions a female make are also different than the males, the males are high strung scurrying around looking for a female, while the females are lazing around with their stomachs bloated waiting to release the eggs. Also when a female is ready she will splash around and you will see anywhere from 3-10 males around her spawning her out."
687263,crosshairs,2012-04-17 00:57:00,55,"Commercial Fisherman can set 5 nets, subsistence can set 3. Night fishing and night hunting were relatively new because indian agents(non natives) would not allow people to hunt or fish, so people had to hide at night to get food for their families. They were not allowed guns etc anyhow.  It doesn't matter what NFN does people will not be happy. At least they have stepped up to the plate to work towards a better future when they don't have to. The courts are behind them 100%. The court decisions that have been made to date have rated the fishery in where the crowns priorities lye.  PRIORITY #1 --FN's subsistence PRIORITY #2 -- FN's commercial PRIORITY #3 -- Sport fishery  If NFN decides tommorrow and says to hell with it the walleye sport fishery will be the first chopped. If there is still no response in the walleye fishery then the FN commercial fishery will be hit, then again if no response to the walleye fishery is seen subsistence harvesters will be affected. So rather than work with the FN lets keep blaming them.  Another point brought up at the summit by tourist outfitters is the lack of enforcement for anglers. guests show up and just know know one is out there, these comments were echoed over the 2 days. So how accurate is the ""optional creel cencus"". NFN has obtained data from a creel done in 1999 and 2000 that creeled the whole day  of fishing  of 2 sectors and found that there numbers ""actuals"" were actually double to triple what creel estimates were showing. Sustainable management ???, not to mention the jump in huts during the winter. When we NFN point fingers we have facts to back our comments."
687264,solopaddler,2012-04-17 00:57:00,8605," What exactly do you mean? That NFN netters catch 100% more walleye than recreational anglers?  Sounds reasonable although a little conservative with the number.  If you meant that figuratively, who cares if the creel census numbers aren't accurate? I mean seriously, recreational anglers aren't the problem.   That fact that NFN members are being audited and everything they do well documented is a completely moot point.  So the demise of a once great fishery is being documented for what? Posterity?    That is unfortunately a common theme everywhere in this province. Scary? No not really. In the grand scheme of things recreational anglers breaking fisheries laws are becoming a rarity.  In this day and age most anglers are well educated on the merits of catch and release and selective harvest.    Now that on the other hand is a scary thought indeed. Nothing like having the inmates run the asylum.   Really? Really?    I'm glad to hear that every NFN member who's spearing walleye is such a knowledgable armchair biologist.  You've certainly dispelled any worries that any egg laden females are being harvested. Thank you for that.   Personally I have zero problems with native Canadians living by a different set of rules than the rest of us. Sure let them net and spear walleye. ONLY if it's for sustenance. If they're selling walleye fillets out of roadside stands, the back of pick up trucks and to restaurants in Toronto, well that's another matter.  Nipissing cannot withstand native harvesting of fish and still remain a viable fishery.  There is an intrinsic value to Nipissing's fishery that is priceless and goes far beyond the obvious economic benefits. Generations of anglers have fished it year after year for decades. Many of the lodges are virtually historical landmarks they've been around that long. The fishery on Nip is the lifeblood of North Bay and the entire region. If native harvesting doesn't stop it will spell doom for not only the local economy, but a way of life for many and an intrinsic part of our northern heritage. The bottom line is NFN members need to stop decimating Nip's fishery NOW and find themselves a suitable alternative."
687279,crosshairs,2012-04-17 01:32:00,55,"Then to top it all off OMNR declines to participate in a lake nipissing summit, can they make our case for co management of lake nip any easier. I know it isn't the locals, they don't make any decisions but someone in peterborough must know how bad that looks. crap a simple presentation.  Commercial fisherman do Mandatory catch forms, they are audited, spearing, non compliance, all fish NFN take are accounted for. The fisherman can sell the fish to who they wish for what ever they wish. The processing plant is optional for them to use, but again all fish are accounted for. NFN's catch this year was 19989kg and the estimated angler is somewhere around 6000kg. Don't quote my numbers these are off the top of my head.  i think it is the best interest of the lake for everyone to work together. We all have a part in the lakes demise. Logging, fishing, railines, sewage, farming, it all ends up in the lake not to mention the enviromental factors that know one can control.  Sorry for my rant but hey others think they are more conservation minded than FN's, i am conservation minded, and very very passionate about this lake. A community of 800, I am related to over half. I give up alot to protect this lake and I don't even fish it because i'm too busy patrolling it for crap pay. Another thing. What is the difference in taking a female in march through the ice or on the spawning bed?? the outcome is totally the same. Shut it down for 10 years to all, then allow a certain  number of licences to fish it, no winter fishing, FN's commercial take out = the same of commercial outfitters. Catch and release only, again these are my personal opinions not the FN's.  So lets question my conservation mind. LOL keep the lake free of everyone. When treaties were signed we didn't have motor boats, but the same treaty you's are apart of (traded for land to live)you's didn't have motor boats or  cars either. The treaty didn't give us anything, we kept what we had you's gained land so actually in my mind it is your treaty.  There I went on again, sorry all just under alot of pressure during this time of year. Good Night"
687281,crosshairs,2012-04-17 01:39:00,55,"Solo paddler I never said I am a biolist just sharing my knowledge, but NFN does have a biologist on staff where OMNR don't. NFN don't have to stop anything if they don't want to, they have legal right to the fishery over everyone else. They are just trying to work with people to fix the complex problems happening in the lake. Not just fishing.  Our numbers will hold more water so to speak than the OMNR who is non existant in the whole picture.  And like I said earlier, it doesn't matter what we say. All i know is , i'm not one whos taking fish out."

I have Native Status (Ojibway) and I do buy a fishing licence, as i hope the MNR will use it for the resourse, as all of us do. I do pay taxes as I am an off reserve native, as many of us are. I have no problems with Natives harvesting fish or game for rights stated within their treaty, remember Natives were hear long before the European Settlers, who could in fact be classed as an invasive species."

687306,solopaddler,2012-04-17 02:11:00,8605,"  Sorry, but there's no way that walleye illegally harvested by the odd cottager amounts to what the natives are doing.  I also see the irony of my earlier statement where I talked about the heritage of ours that's being decimated by the netting and spearing.  I do agree that native Canadians have every right to net and spear. If it was only for ceremonial purposes and sustenance there'd be no problem, but it's not.  When those treaties were signed natives weren't using high tech equipment to harvest hundreds of thousands of pounds of walleye. They were doing it in a manner that was much more sustainable.  There comes a time when enough is enough and regardless of whatever was signed in those ancient treaties, common sense must prevail. If natives reserve the right to adapt their tactics, increase their harvest numbers exponentially all the while utilising modern day methods and techniques, the treaties should be amended accordingly!  This entire question brings to mind a joke that somehow seems fitting:   An Arab enters a taxi..........  Once he is seated he asks the cab driver to turn off the radio because he must not hear music as decreed by his religion. In the time of the prophet there was no music, especially western music which is music of the infidel's and certainly no radio.  The cab driver politely switches off the radio, stops the cab and opens the back door.  The Arab asks him: What are you doing man?  The cabby answers: In the time of the prophet there were no taxis, so get out of my taxi and wait for a camel!  "

686936,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 13:50:00,2449,"O.k, just learned some disturbing news.  I have been well aware that Nipissing First Nation placed a ban on gill-netting during the spawn ""spring spawn netting moratorium that has been in place for several years will continue and is already scheduled for April 1 through May 10"". There were still offenders caught netting during the spawn last year.  However, I was not aware that they continue to allow spearing during the spawn. There is a limit of 20 fish per boat PER DAY and that is just a recent ammendment. They recently added no night spearing to the regulations as well.   Here is the link to the Nipissing First Nation Resources Newsletter for Spring 2012. NFN Spring 2012    Now, let me make this clear. I am not calling out NFN for netting and spearing as I feel they have that right. I am dumbfounded by the quota #s for such a fragile fishery and to permit the NFN fisherman to spear 20 spawning walleye per day. More then 40 days of spearing during the spawn could ammount to 800 walleye per fisherman. Here is a recent article from the North Bay Nugget with quotes from Clayton Goulais (Crosshairs) whom I have had several good conversations with. He is an enforcement officer with NFN.  Walleye spawn beginning on Lake Nipissing Admin on Apr 13, 2012 in Local News | 0 comments  By DAVE DALE The Nugget - The walleye in Lake Nipissing have started moving into spawning grounds. And Nipissing First Nation is bolstering its monitoring program to enforce the community’s moratorium on gill netting which began April 1 and continues until May 10.  “It’s just, just starting and there’s not much activity going on,” Clayton Goulais, Nipissing FN’s resource management enforcement officer, said Thursday morning. Goulais said six monitors will be scouting the lake and boat launches on-and-off reserve to cut down on unauthorized commercial harvesting. Other authority agencies will also be patrolling the lake to enforce water safety laws.  Nipissing FN revised its resource management law last year after not meeting a reduced harvest quota twice and fall walleye index netting studies showed a sharp decline in spawning age fish. Spearing is now being restricted to 20 walleye per boat and banned after midnight. Goulais said he knows three people who have gone out spearing and each only harvested four or five walleye, illustrating the early stage of the spawn.  “The water is still cold,” he said, adding that rain early this week probably warmed up the creeks and turned on the smelt run, with warmer weather and rain possibly doing the same for walleye. He said a person can usually tell which walleye are females and “conservation-minded” spear harvesters try to focus on males.  Goulais said the public can call him at 705-498-3823 if they want to report gill netting activity.  Nipissing FN organized a Lake Nipissing Summit April 3-4 and the presentations were recently posted to thewww.lakenipissingsummit.ca website. A plan to study and address environmental and fishery issues is expected to come after stakeholders review the input of summit participants.  I know this debate opens a can of worms every time so lets stay on track with this thread.  "
686939,mike rousseau,2012-04-16 14:13:00,4661,"they fill coolers every night in my area spearing walleye...  and thats their ""right"" i guess...unethical...i would say so...  not all take advantage... one of my best friends is first nations... and hes disgusted by this practice...      i have a question for those who know...  are first nations allowed to spear spawning walleye off of their reservation areas...?  cause where i live they spear a river that is way outside their reservations boundaries...but nobody does anything...mnr watches them do it all the time...      and just so there is no confusion...  im ok with first nations not having to follow the same seasons and catch limits as the rest of north america.... as ridiculous as that is...as long as its with a rod and hook... this whole spearing em while they are spawning is a disgusting practice and should be stopped...or at least a reasonable possession limit put in place...i understand this is how some get their fish for the year... but really....how many walleye can one family eat?  i dont mean any offense to anybody...im just concerned about how much damage is done by this spearing every year...."
686944,ecmilley,2012-04-16 14:27:00,2163,"i am still trying to figure why there is two sets of rights for canadians, one set for natives and one for everyone else, don't agree with it at all"
686952,Headhunter,2012-04-16 14:35:00,5703,"Well, at least Nip is still beautiful area to spend some time... not necessarily fishing....  HH"
686957,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 14:47:00,11391,"I've had this debate with many people over the years.  First off, let me say, all my children and my girlfriend are first nations. It is lawfully their right to harvest fish in a reasonable manner when they chose. But, My kids still fish within the seasons just like me. I just feel better about doing it that way, and letting the fish spawn when it's their time to spawn, I enjoy my fishery very much, and look forward to doing so for the rest of my days, as well as theirs.  I fish with many other natives, and they also follow the regulations. I very seldom see anyone in my local abusing the resource. Two times per year, I see one net get set for two days. It gets pulled out ever few hours, and the fish are filleted. The reserve hold a fish fry for the youth and the elders of the reservation. I'm totally fine with that, because IMO it's within reason, and not done in a spawning time. In fact, I've even participated as a volunteer to cook for the youth/elders.  As far as the rights that are ""handed"" to first nations, I don't necessarily agree with it, but I don't agree with how many of the Natives have been treated either.  But, if it's the law, I respect that. And there are certain things I myself will take advantage of, like free dental and free schooling for my children.  All in all, I'd like to see things equal for all CANADIANS. But it is a complex situation...  MM, it is my understanding that the right to harvest is within the reservation boundries that are local to that reserve/band. That was how it was explained to me by a CO. So one band member cannot harvest above normal limits while in another reserve boundry, or totally outside of a treaty area."
686966,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 15:01:00,11391,"and I've never even heard of anyone spearing walleye???? I'm not even sure how I feel about that?  One thing I know MM, is that first nations do have laws to follow as well, but in some areas are different then others, so it's tough to comment on without knowing for sure. But, I think MNR is hesitant in dealing with First Nations when it comes to hunting and fishing, because it's a slippery slope. Also, it might not even be that, it might be that even the CO's are unsure of what the actual laws are in these regards (sounds silly I know, but Native laws can be incredibly confusing)."
686967,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 15:02:00,11391, I totally agree Sinclair   
686968,mike rousseau,2012-04-16 15:04:00,4661,  thats what i thought as well... but it seems everyone walks on eggshells in fear of mass protests shutting down the local economy... last issue in my area was border officers(office was on reservation land) carrying firearms... the first nations people protested this and shut down the bridge rerouting thousands of vehicles through other border crossings...devastated local businesses for quite some time...couple months if i remember right... and cost TAXPAYERS loads of money due to the fact that they had to abandon the border office and build a new site off of the reservation... all because the criminals(the few giving others a bad wrap) running tobacco products across the bridge didnt want to get shot at...
686971,mike rousseau,2012-04-16 15:10:00,4661,  yup...they go at night with flashlights... a spear...and a cooler...  they go right to the gravel bed that was paid for with fishing license dollars to help the walleye spawn better...but in the end it concentrated numbers making it easier to spear...
686973,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 15:19:00,11391," I've witnessed similar issues near my home as well on another reservation. Just last year actually. The highway runs through a reserve, and the reserve protested something(can't remember what?) so they put up a road toll right in the middle of the highway on after a sharp corner and just before the Causway bridge. It was very dangerous too. The truckers etc really didn't like it, and it let to quite the racial battle between hat reserve and my hometown. Alot of racism on both parts and things got ugly, alot of people showed their true colors. Shorlty after, it was taken down. I can't recall how the disput was resolved???     Yeah, see that's not acceptable IMO. I guess things are different in your area for the reservations/band members. In my area those things just don't really happen too often. Even the band members would be putting a stop to that really quick where I'm from.  Then again, we do have a few reserves in the area that I'd imagine things like that happen in.  Ask Aaron Shirley if he remembers getting golf balls hit at him in NW Bay while trying to film his fishing show, lol  "
686982,cram,2012-04-16 15:32:00,1733,"I think they absolutely have the right to do it.  Pretty sure they would have been picking up walleye on the spawn when europeans came here.  But, I also think it's very short-sighted of them if they want to preserve a fishery."
686984,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 15:36:00,11391," Good point, but the Natives of old were incredibly smart when it comes to nature/harvesting. I've seen fashioned dip nets that were used along time ago, so they could release spawning females. Can't do that with a spear.   "
686991,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 16:10:00,2449,"My concern and reason for posting this is from all reports including NFN the walleye index counts are down 3 straight years now. NFN has lowered their netting quotas and still can't reach their # of 60,000 tonnes (from 90,000). SO, why target spawning walleye with nets or spears? Like my o.p. 1 native fisherman can spear 20 walleye per day from April 1- May 10. That is more then 40 days of spearing and potential harvest could be 800 walleye. I believe there are only about 18 registered comercial fisherman within NFN but this srearing right is given to all with status. I agree with many posters here and not all natives use their rights to harvest fish as/when needed, but if even 1 native netted 200 spawning walleye (5 per day x 40 days) it would be (is) devistating to the fishery.    Gee, I woneder why they can't meet their netting quotas???????????   What happens on May 11th? What about walleye that were late to spawn?"
686994,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 16:18:00,11391," Yeah, thats exactly it. I can totally understand where your coming from.  My guess would be a lack of knowledge on the subject, because, well obviously this is just an ignorant way to do things, it makes no sense at all.  The quotas are totally messed up too, and lawfully should be re-written IMO. 20 fish per day is obsurd, even with 10 children in a household that is too much. And the quotas should incorperate no fishing during the spawn, or at the very least the release of all females during the spawn.  There is 8 people in my household, we have a big family. We keep enough fish for a few meals per year (probably anywhere between 4-10 limits per year), but it takes 4 fish, 4 potatoes and a bag of veggies to feed are whole household for an evening.   "
687003,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 16:32:00,2449, He said a person can usually tell which walleye are females and “conservation-minded” spear harvesters try to focus on males.  The quote in the article indicates that the spearers can target males not the females but how many are conservation-minded?
687010,Headhunter,2012-04-16 16:40:00,5703,"Not to mention the collateral damage caused by netting Nip… but I guess that the more things change, the more they stay the same… I would like to hear from Crossfire on this though... he has shown a willingness to discuss this issue in the past and I hope he is willing to do so again... as long as we here remain respectful...toward him. HH"
687013,Billy Bob,2012-04-16 16:43:00,5865, This was a big issue in the State of Wisconsin a few years ago....I really don't know how it ended but here's what I remember reading..  Native Americans were spearing walleyes during the spawn...they cited treaties from a hundred years ago or more that guaranteed them that right as this was their traditional way to harvest these fish at this time of the year...OK....but they were using modern equipment/methods to do it....they were spearing at night using metal three prong pitch fork spears while wearing high powered head lamps to spot the fish and using electric trolling motors to move about....nothing traditional in this kind of fishing even with the most liberal minded person..... I know many sportsmen clubs were up in arms there but I never heard how this was resolved.
687014,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 16:45:00,11391," Yeah, I seen that. Don't believe it for one second though.  If you can see the fish, the only way to ""guess"" which are females would be size, and it would be exactly that, a guess.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I've never met one person that could decipher the difference while the fish is in the water. I certainly could'nt do it, thats for sure.  I just can't wrap my head around spearing the fish??? If I had to harvest solely for the purpose of feeding my family, I'd be looking at the best method available not only for catching the fish, but also maintaining the fishery.  But anyhow, if they choose this method, I'd be willing to bet the majority are not conservative minded. If they were conservative minded, would they not look at a more effective method? Thats just my train of though...  "
687015,blarg,2012-04-16 16:47:00,289,"Its just the way it is, and there is no one with the political will to change it, ill accept they have the right when they admit that their concern for the environment is just propaganda, a sham, I care more about the environment then most natives do, I care more about conservation then most natives do.  Im tired of the 'noble savage' Bull, and most natives I know would tell you the same, but those in charge are playing us with this Bull, its insulting to their own people, they are no different than I am."
687025,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 17:02:00,11391," I'd say that's off topic. This isn't a race issue IMO.  It's ignorance and the effect it will have on the fishery.  Many people of all races and colors overharvest fish worldwide, legally and illegally."
687029,Roy,2012-04-16 17:06:00,13728,Keep it respectful please.
687035,Nipfisher,2012-04-16 17:13:00,2449,"  Roy, I understand this is a touchy subject. I had no intentions of making this about race or politics. Just frustreated with the declining walleye #s being reported but then they target the spawning walleye?"
687037,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 17:16:00,11391," Thats a lawful issue, not a race issue.  The thread is about the fishery and overharvesting   "
687046,manitoubass2,2012-04-16 17:29:00,11391," And by that thought process, everything is correlated to race.  The rights that Native Americans have were given to them by the Canadian Government. So whether or not you accept it, it's a issue with how the fishery is being handled by OUR Canadian government.  I get what your saying, but thats an issue you should take up with the correct channels.  and where I live, given the example you gave, both guys are in jail and facing charges for resource abuse     "
687048,BillM,2012-04-16 17:34:00,17367,They've been spearing walleyes in the spring forever.  Isn't the walleye population on Nipissing actually on the upswing?
