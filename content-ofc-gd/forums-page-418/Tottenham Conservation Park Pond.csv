Blows my mind that people camp there all summer long, city folk think it is the north and in the bush lol.  I grew up there. Not a bad spot but not my ideal place to put an rv for the summer lol"

I was just looking for a place where I could get to for a few hours in the summer evenings after I get home from work or for those weekends when I cant get away up north to the ""real"" outdoors.  This place is not that far from me and if there are bass in the lake....I think I'll give it a whirl.  Thanks for the info.......  Meely"
