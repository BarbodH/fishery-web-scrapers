687352,Handlebarz,2012-04-17 10:45:00,3790,  Paul you should know better Joey would never kick you out when your gone with the boat    That is her's and she will use it to move all her tackle if that day were to come. Your safe when she tells you to go fishing alone just worry when she sends you carp fishing for a weekend from shore.
687365,aplumma,2012-04-17 11:37:00,6896,"Well if it is Joey and the boat with fishing tackle, boy did you get the perfect wife Paul...   Very nice fish too glad you caught dinner and looks like possible a few sandwiches for lunch too.   Art"
