688315,bushart,2012-04-19 12:57:00,2628,Couple generic questions on these critters if I may??  What size lure you droppin to 16 ft  What was the water temp?  And do they appear as baitfish on your screen----also are they in some sort of cover--or just on a flat  Reason I ask this---Apparently crappie are in a nearby lake ---big and deep  I'm tryin lots with zip success---I've never been a crappie angler all this time---just learnin
