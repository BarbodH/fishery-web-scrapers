687390,torco,2012-04-17 13:10:00,656,Well its been just over a week since our newest arrival came and so far so good. Baby Nora was born on the Thursday of the Easter weekend and is doing really well. Our first daughter is now 2 and seems to be taking everything in stride and adjusting well.  Anyways I just thought I`d share.
