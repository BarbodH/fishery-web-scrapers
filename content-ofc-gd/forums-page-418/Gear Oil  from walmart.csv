686682,Billy Bob,2012-04-15 19:11:00,5865,I have used their SuperTech 2 cycle oil for a long time....I'm convinced it's made by Lubermatic....good stuff for a great price.....is the gear oil the correct weight for your outboard....if so you wouldn't have a problem with it.....I have used automotive gear oil in my outboard for many years as it's the same stuff in a different bottle for a lot less money.
