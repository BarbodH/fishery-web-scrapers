For some reason there are a few I cant get rid of.  They appear to be ""administrative"" cookies and are stuck like glue when I try to delete them.  Any suggestions on how to get rid of them?? Running Windows XP.  Thanks for any info.....  Meely"

Just make sure you have a checkmark beside ""Cookies"".  If they are super cookies (LSO's) then you can get an add-on for Firefox to remove them.  The add-on is called ""Better Privacy"". When removing super cookies make sure you look at them,then pick the ones you want to remove. You can remove them all (remove all LSO's) or one by one by highlighting the LSO then click on ""remove LSO"". The main thing is know what you want to remove and what you want to keep.  Some games use LSO's for settings or data.  Tom"
