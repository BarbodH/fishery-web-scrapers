686498,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-04-14 23:52:00,160,I have recently got into steel head fishing. My dad never fished it but I went once and I like it. I want to go tomorrow but not sure where to go and what to do. I know the basics but not much about steelhead. If anyone is willing to meet somewhere to go pm me with your cell and i give you a call. Thanks
