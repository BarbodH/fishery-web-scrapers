688020,uglyfish,2012-04-18 19:33:00,981," Lol I'm aware of that. But when ur commited to making a hit and ur already at that point, stopping isn't in ur mind. Especially if u wanna see the ice again!  Cause no coach is gonna say "" way to hold up on that chance for a hit"" u'll be benched.  In this case, I see the irony that he would still see the ice had he stopped, but as I previously mentioned, the only thing that made that hit illegal, was him leaving his feel. If he keeps his skates on the ice and delivers the same check, there's no suspension, and he's gonna be on tsn hilights for the right reason."
688028,woodenboater,2012-04-18 19:53:00,2277,"and that's the problem with Torres. He could have chosen to stay on the ice and deliver a different hit but no, he had to launch himself and thusly rendering total loss of control of where his mass is going. Stay on the ice and maintain control. He could just as easily have moved left and still given Hossa a hard hello. Torre's a loose canon that needs to be declawed.  Ok, I've watched the video a couple of times and I do believe Hossa was headed for the bench. You can see another player start to climb over when Hossa gets hammered."
688047,addy79,2012-04-18 20:37:00,573," Dually noted, Sir"
688050,torco,2012-04-18 20:40:00,656, I realize the game happens quickly obviously he couldn't bail on the hit but by leaving his feet he made sure he was going to destroy him. The game is changing what was not seen as serious in the past is no longer the case.
688052,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 20:41:00,11391," Man oh man, I wasn't even aware of the other suspensions he has received outside of last years playoffs.  I'm not surprised now, that so much attention is surrounding him.  He needs a reality check of his own.  "
688066,muskymatt,2012-04-18 21:07:00,2608," Agreed, the rest of the playoffs and 50 games next year, that would send a message"
688070,jedimaster,2012-04-18 21:15:00,3472,"They said on the radio 15 games next season would cost him 570k... OUCH!!! thats alot of years on my salary. I really don't know what is appropriate for this suspension. but I would think less than 10 games is really a slap on the wrist. I mean he really went in hard to hit him and left his feet in the process. This in itself is a charge and an illegal hit. and as such he should be suspended. Late hit, Not a late hit, Finishing his check or dirty hit. It doesn't matter to me. It was a charge and attempt to injure plain ans simple. I guarante you if he hits hossa and doesn't give the extra oompf and leaves his feet, adn hossa doesn't get carried away in a stretcher this play goes unnoticed."
688077,addy79,2012-04-18 21:24:00,573, not a chance...
688080,jedimaster,2012-04-18 21:31:00,3472," I know a guy that plays for the hawks, I'll forward your question on to him along with your address and he will let you know.  haha No I don't think it was for show, He got corked pretty good. They really need to be careful. If you don't get up, your going off on a stretcher."
688084,kickingfrog,2012-04-18 21:35:00,8333," Clearly don't understand simple math.  At the speed the game is played at now skaters can travel over 30 feet per second (based on 40 kph). NHL players, even ""unskilled"" ones, can make a lot of moves in 30 feet.  Raffy knew exactly what he was doing and chose to do it anyway."
688087,muskymatt,2012-04-18 21:40:00,2608," Yup, right there!"
688088,BassMan11,2012-04-18 21:40:00,583,"I bet if the stretcher wasn't out there and Hossa makes it to the bench we aren't talking about this hit on the same level. Example, his hit on Seabrook last year. He gets up after being ko'd. No suspension."
688106,woodenboater,2012-04-18 22:14:00,2277,"I'm not a first responder nor have any formal training at all (wife had wilderness first responder training but that's neither here nor there) and I believe the stretcher is protocol for possible neck and spinal injuries. Isolate the head to avoid any possible problems, most accidents I've seen the person injured is put in a collar and a strap or tape put around their forehead and secured to the litter. If there's a member here in emergency response, they would know for sure.  I hope the players look at what's going on and decide that enough is enough and that pucks in the net win games, not brutal hits."
688127,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 23:14:00,11391," Yep, thats just protocol.   "
687779,woodenboater,2012-04-18 02:41:00,2277,"Wow, after Jonathan Toews criticized the fact that Shea Weber escaped a suspension, Raffi Torres nails Marian Hossa. Leaves his skates for the hit. and this is only the first round. If Shanahan doesn't show some backbone, someone is going to get seriously hurt before they hand over the Lord's cup."
687783,kickingfrog,2012-04-18 02:47:00,8333,"Too many hockey players, and fans, are looking for big hits instead of good hits."
687786,woodenboater,2012-04-18 02:53:00,2277,"Doesn't anyone throw old school mid ice hip checks anymore ? Torres should be tossed for the rest of the playoffs and well into next season as well. Repeat offender who obviously hasn't learned anything.  NHL needs to drop four or five teams and thin the pool, put some emphasis back on exciting (ie-no dirty hits) end to end play."
687790,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-18 03:08:00,10439,That was a brutal hit. They better hit him very hard for that one. The guys as dirty as they come.
687799,[emailÂ protected],2012-04-18 03:29:00,119,"Get rid of the instigator penalty, let the players enforce themselves, problem reduced considerably."
687813,uglyfish,2012-04-18 04:35:00,981," Exactly!! Torres will get 6 games. IF he stays on the ice, its a clean hit. Injury or not. But he left his feet, making it a charge."
687817,Stoty,2012-04-18 05:30:00,2910,"Torres is a joke of an NHL player.... the ONLY way he gets any attention is to pull stunts like that. I hope he gets what's coming to him... and more!  Good ole case of ""small man's syndrome"". Enjoy watching the rest of the playoffs from the sidelines!!"
687828,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 10:48:00,5784,"Yup, Torres for Hossa is NOT a good trade. I'm a phx fan, but poop like this makes the game worse overall"
687839,Harrison,2012-04-18 11:21:00,2202,"Not cool, Hossa was cutting back to the bench, cheap hit, IMO and leaving his feet proved his intent.  Smoking a guy peeling back against the play is cheap."
687855,BassMan11,2012-04-18 12:05:00,583,"I agree with Sinclair 100%. Scott Stevens had done this countless times in his career. Where did it change from big hits to dirty hits? This hit was a bit late but whatever happened to ""keep your head up""? Be Aware of who is on the ice  There is a lot of admiring passes and skating with your head down going on in the NHL today. Being a defenseman that played a hitting game its tough to watch every ""big hit"" get looked at by shanny. This one was called right during the game. 5 min charge and a game. But 6 games for hitting a guy that is fine the next day. Come on. Looked bad at the time though and glad he's fine."
687860,bubbles,2012-04-18 12:19:00,591,  This time.....what about next time?
687861,Harrison,2012-04-18 12:25:00,2202,"Difference between Stevens and this hit was Stevens lined you up as you were cutting across or accepting/admiring a pass in open ice coming at him and he took you out of the play, not when you were peeling back into your own zone.  Not too long ago when cheapies like this happened you expected knuckles to the nose,  now you just get a pile on."
687863,woodenboater,2012-04-18 12:31:00,2277,"While the Stevens locomotive was of the time, I think it's now part of the bigger picture re: injuries and marketability for the NHL.  Too many players seem to be injured and some is the result of advanced equipment materials. Are they ever going to bring back softer padded elbow pads ?  I think we're all for good clean hits but this wasn't. Hossa wasn't admiring anything and was out of play and Torres launching himself was just wrong and imo, premeditated. He had enough time to contemplate his course of action and chose to leave his skates.  I'd hate to see us go back to the days when Shore, Bailey and Horner ( yes, no helmets back then) lit it up."
687867,bushart,2012-04-18 13:01:00,2628,That Steven's hit on Ron Francis was not pretty at the time  Guys are bigger and stronger now and according to Cherry forever and a day---the eqpt has zero give to it  I'm sayin Torres has a trend in headshots---and cause somebody's not lookin at the time---does not make it ok  Gonna hit---that's fine----keep the dirty sneak attacks out  Be a man hit hard but the victim should be able to brace himself
687868,torco,2012-04-18 13:07:00,656,Bad hit from a bad hockey player. He should get a lengthy suspension. He could have let up since Hossa no longer had the puck.
687953,uglyfish,2012-04-18 17:12:00,981," There was 0.8 seconds between the time he lost the puck and got hit. Good luck changing ur mind on hitting someone that quick, the game on the ice happens a lot faster then u see on tv. That timeline is acceptable to finish a check, wasn't a late hit. He left his feet, making it illegal. If he stayed on the ice, its a good hard clean hit. Torres is no saint, and for that reason, he's gonna get nailed. Hossa wasn't turning to the bench, so I don't know where that came from, from whoever mentioned that.  And the difference between scott stevens and a lot of the hits we see now, was all of stevens hits were good clean hockey hits, that due to the force and the position of the other player, sometimes have devestating results.  See>>> Eric lindross, when u skate with ur head down, ur gonna get drilled."
687959,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 17:32:00,11391,"watch Stevens hits.  Almost all of them are shoulder to head. That was a legal hit then however.  But yeah, Stevens hit on Lindros today and thats a big suspension  Here is a good body check, lol  "
687961,Harrison,2012-04-18 17:40:00,2202,"It was I who mentioned him heading to the bench, I saw the highlight wrong."
687962,jimmer,2012-04-18 17:40:00,2730,"The best way to stop guys like Torres is to ban him from hockey for a year or two. Losing all that income, the message will get through. Might be severe, but how many guys have to get hurt by him and others like him. Cooke on Pittsburg is an example. His career was being threatened because of his on ice behaviour. He changed his ways this year and made a positive contribution to the team. Don't get me wrong, I love hard hitting hockey, just not the cheap head shots."
687968,addy79,2012-04-18 17:48:00,573, not for nothin but .8 seconds is LOADS of time to lay off....
687972,bushart,2012-04-18 18:01:00,2628,Cooke for the Pens changed his ways---there's always hope
687990,uglyfish,2012-04-18 18:32:00,981, u've clearly never played hockey before....
687993,uglyfish,2012-04-18 18:35:00,981," no, some were shoulder to head, most were shoulder to chest, and the ones that did contact the head, as u mentioned, were legal hits then... but, also were not what stevens was targetting it, they were usually due to the size difference in players he hit, of the result of players skaing while looking down, putting themselves in that vulnerable position.  and even now, with the head shot rules... u can still contact a players head with a check, AS LONG AS, it it not targeted intentionally, and is not the main point of contact on the hit."
687997,addy79,2012-04-18 18:41:00,573," I love those assumptions. I'd have to ask you the same question then. have you??  if you cant make a stop (i dont care how fast your goin) or change directions in less than a second you may be playin, but you aint palyin well...  men's league dont count bud"
688006,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 19:04:00,11391,"  Yeah, I forgot about the intent to hit the head aspects.  For Stevens hits I should have mentioned also that I'm referring to some of the more memorable hits, but yeah, I don't see intent to hit the head.  I know he had TONS of clean, hard hits in his day as well.  Whenever him or Rob Blake were on the ice, I was always watching closely for that big hit to come.    "
