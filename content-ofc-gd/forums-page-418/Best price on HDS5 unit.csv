687165,Dan668,2012-04-16 20:55:00,1120,"Bbg marine 429 after rebate. Hds 5, if you know someone in the states free shipping. I bought my Hds 8 from them."
687168,Dan668,2012-04-16 20:58:00,1120,You need a transducer for it? Or are you putting it on the bow with the trolling motor?

687363,aplumma,2012-04-17 11:33:00,6896,Does the hds series offer built in maps for Canada? All of the ones I see in the States list insight for USA only. Cabelos has some great deals right now but if you need to buy a map chip that for maps you can get preloaded the deal seems to be less attractive.   Art
687366,grimsbylander,2012-04-17 11:44:00,3016,"  You are correct Art. The HDS units with Lowrance's ""Insight"" is mainly US lakes. They do however include the Great Lakes though. It really doesn't matter which HDS model we purchase here in Canada you pretty much have to go with a Navionics chip to get the detail fisherman look for."
