687240,Roy,2012-04-16 23:57:00,13728,How deep is the snow for the poor moose's antlers to just be sticking out of the snow like that.
687249,Leecher,2012-04-17 00:23:00,7832,That's crazy Jason    I think you're going to have to use a snowblower if it keeps going
687256,Basskicker,2012-04-17 00:41:00,421,"Snowblower...haha.... I put that in the FAR back of the garage weeks ago!!!duh   And the shovel is in the garage as well.  It's just crazy....It was 13'C at 4 P.M. yesterday afternoon, raked the lawn, put some patio slabs down....5 hours later it turned cold quick and hasn't stopped snowing yet!!!  Worst comes to worst I'll break a trail for the wife with the snowmobile to get to work in the morning  Jason"
687679,pics,2012-04-17 21:58:00,1268,At least someone is getting precipitation of some kind...we need rain in the worst way...streams are at summer levels already and the fields are dry and cracked.
687154,Leecher,2012-04-16 20:42:00,7832,"I don't know about you but the South Westerly been pretty constant since this morning, more so this late afternoon and increasing  We've been put on a storm alert with heavy winds of up to 100km/h for the region over here   This really feels like tornado grounds to happen anywhere at any moment... please be careful if your thinking of going out fishing!  TJunkie"
687158,Christopheraaron,2012-04-16 20:44:00,3525,It's been pretty strong here but nowhere near 100 maybe 50.

687166,Leecher,2012-04-16 20:56:00,7832," It's kind of scary over here right now  I've been keeping an eye out on the cloud formation from the south west.    Sorry Paul, not hiding...  But truly found my love again for trout hunting this past hard water season   hence to new handle   only fitting don't you think?"
687169,Leecher,2012-04-16 20:59:00,7832, Holy moly Dave... are you still ice fishing up there?  I bet you are eh    That's some lovely weather you're having.

687172,woodenboater,2012-04-16 21:09:00,2277,"About an hour ago, the clouds looked like they would be right at home in Mordor, with appropriate howling winds. Sunny and quite windy right right now. Waiting for the temp drop.  ot. jerk chicken tonight"
687174,misfish,2012-04-16 21:12:00,29133,"Same here and jerk chicken sound good.Im just doing BBQ breast, for  chicken ceaser wraps tonight."
687179,Rod Caster,2012-04-16 21:18:00,5784,Strong winds here. Gusts past 50kph. The clouds look funny too... not normal.  Since others mentioned dinner.... I'm cooking up some Ling tonight and making some Gravlax as Bluegill posted a while back.
687180,Leecher,2012-04-16 21:18:00,7832," What can I say Dave... It's all I've been chasing this past season... can't be any happier with that   now for those green trout that swims everywhere up here, they're any story   Rain just started as I type this... lots of heavy clouds hanging over"
687183,Leecher,2012-04-16 21:25:00,7832,   No BBQ for me... It's sheppers pie but all of the above sounds real good
687184,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-16 21:27:00,10439, Got at least another month of ice up here. Still tons of snow on top of the 4'+ of ice. I haven't had the motivation to go out ice fishing since I got back from Florida though. Can't wait for some liquid water to run my boats around on.
687185,Roy,2012-04-16 21:30:00,13728,East of Montreal at 5PM we had 30C...feels like 33C. Winds out of the South at 30K gusting to 48K. Humidity at 35%. *Throws his chalk in the air doing his best Percy Saltzman imitation* Yeah yeah...I know that they didn't use humidex readings back then.
687186,Christopheraaron,2012-04-16 21:34:00,3525," It's a little worse than how I judged it, old cherry tree just fell over in my neighbours yard!"
687187,Leecher,2012-04-16 21:35:00,7832, I don't blame you Dave    the ice been out for some time down here and I'm waiting for trout opener to start chasing them all over again    But I don't have to wait another month for that.... just less than a couple of weeks actually
687189,pics,2012-04-16 21:38:00,1268,Working the coke oven battery here in the hammer...26c....30 with the humidity...but since we work on a giant oven it feels well into the 40's...the winds out on the harbour look brutal...huge whitecaps..too bad we don't feel much of the wind due to the direction its coming from...
687190,Leecher,2012-04-16 21:39:00,7832, We're at 26C of the same time and it's raining now... winds has come down somewhat and looking to have the wet stuff around for some time now   Yikesss   better check around your house once the wind subside.
687191,Leecher,2012-04-16 21:41:00,7832," Man, brutal conditions Pics"
687196,Gerritt,2012-04-16 21:55:00,6129,mmmmm Sheppards pie!!!! what I wouldn't give for a home made one right now...  I am making a dutch pot roast... while awesome I love a good sheppards pie!   G
687198,Basskicker,2012-04-16 22:01:00,421,It's -11'C  with a windchill of -21'C and it started snowing/blowing last night around 9 P.M. and its still snowing!!!  Some places the ground is bare and some places over 3 feet where it has drifted and I REFUSE to shovel anymore....it will eventually melt...hopefully  Jason
687201,Leecher,2012-04-16 22:08:00,7832," I find the sheppards pie re-heated is best    a little bit of home-made ketchup and it's awesome    but a dutch roast sounds good to me too   Jason, where you from?  nasty weather you've been having   like you said... will melt eventually, no need to shovel, I know I wouldn't either"
687235,Basskicker,2012-04-16 23:51:00,421,"Manitouwadge, ON      And it's still snowing!!! Think I'm going to go for a ride on the snowmobile tommorrow"
