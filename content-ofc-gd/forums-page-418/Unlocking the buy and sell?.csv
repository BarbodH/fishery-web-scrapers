687394,Spiel,2012-04-17 13:17:00,9065,"As noted from the Classified Rules located at the top of the Classified sections.......  ""New members will be unable to post until they have achieved a minimum post count of (20)."""

687445,ratherboutdoors,2012-04-17 14:43:00,132,  Tried that but have not heard back.  I wasn't sure if it went through.
687478,Twocoda,2012-04-17 15:54:00,4130,Give Mercman you password and he can launch your post count into the thousands in a few days...  or.....you could post a thread introducing yourself...and thank everyone for the kind words individually then you should be good to go...

687480,Roy,2012-04-17 15:59:00,13728," Go to your messenger page, click on that conversation and at the upper left of the page you'll see ""participants"". It'll tell you when you accessed the message last and when the one you sent it to accessed it. It'll say ""not yet read"" if he has not seen it."

687542,Roy,2012-04-17 18:17:00,13728, Maybe you overwhelmed him with your generous offer!
687559,ratherboutdoors,2012-04-17 18:36:00,132,"  No offer, just wanted his contact info.  Although, from what he has listed maybe I shouldn't go see him, might cost me some $$."
