687305,bigbuck,2012-04-17 02:11:00,2449," A couple of the gurus from Iboats don't recommend it for a stabilizer. I defer to their knowledge, they've been boat techs for over 30 yrs and know their stuff. As for ethanol, it doesn't pull moisture out of the air. The biggest problem with water mixing in the fuel is a bad seal on the gas cap on boats. That's straight from boating tv a couple weeks ago. They did a segment on ethanol fuels and basically said just run it like normal and put in an additive at the end of the season. Its here to stay and more and more fuel docks are pumping it. Its not great, don't get me wrong, but its the new reality so learn to work with it."
687325,NANUK,2012-04-17 02:53:00,797,"Seafoam or Stabil Marine, those are the only two I use in every tank of gas. It is equally(if not more)important to use stabilizer during summer because gas evaporates at a much faster rate with heat."
687350,skeeter,2012-04-17 09:52:00,1907,"I use both, Star tron & Seafoam !  And Seafoam is only $6.59 a can !!"
687494,hirk,2012-04-17 16:52:00,571,Seafoams primary function is to keep injectors/carbs clean and prevent carbon build up on pistons/rings in a 2 stroke(this is the leading cause of major 2 stroke engine failure). It does have a fuel stabilizing aspect to it as well though but if you run the engine regularly you shouldnt have fuel degredation or problems related to ethanol with the fuel itself. I ran an over hub exhaust prop and watched  exhaust from seafoam treated gas clean the carbon deposits off the prop.If just the exhaust gases can do that Im sure my rings are clean enough to eat off of so it goes in every tank.
687693,fisherman7,2012-04-17 22:36:00,325,I too sing the praises of Seafoam. Cleared up a 2hp Johnston that my buddy stored for 3 years without any prep and my surging snow blower. Excellent stuff!
687702,danc,2012-04-17 23:12:00,4677,"One of my best results with seafoam was with an old inherited snowblower as well. I couldn't keep it running unless I played with the choke constantly (which meant I wasn't blowing any snow  ). A good shot of seafoam had it running like a sewing machine. As far as a fuel stabilzer, I've used it a couple of times the past few years. It worked I guess. But in the past 25 years I've also not used any stabilizer at all, probably 80% of the time, and have never suffered any issues with bad gas. Not once. And my off season is at least 8 months long. Personally I think that the fuel stabilizing issue is way overblown. Just don't tell the folks at Stabil that I said that."
687704,Billy Bob,2012-04-17 23:15:00,5865,Seafoam is so good I now use it to marinate my fish before I grill them......
687705,Jer_H,2012-04-17 23:16:00,25,I never even thought of using it on my snowblower.  Especially because it didn't even get started this year!
687743,RickOnt,2012-04-18 00:49:00,669,Use Star Tron all season and the blue Stabill for Winterizing.  Never neaded SeaFoam  Rick
687758,SirCranksalot,2012-04-18 01:47:00,3291,I use premium gas in my lawnmower and  small outboard if there's any chance the gas will be left in over the winter or in the tank for several months. I have read and heard too much about about the ethanol in reg. gas absorbing water etc that I don't trust it. For the small amount of gas I use the price diff is fairly small---a lot cheaper than fixing a gummed up carb.
686741,Jer_H,2012-04-15 21:19:00,25,"Hi all,  Just curious how many people regularily use a fuel additive.  Is it more of a precautionary measure, or do you consider it necessary?  Is it just for older, or 2-strokes?  This will be my 3rd season with my boat and I have never added anything to the fuel aside from adding stabilizer when it's winterized.  It's a 2010 4-stroke Merc.  Thanks in advance,  Jeremy"
686747,barrystrs,2012-04-15 21:27:00,75,"I'm sure you will get lots of different opinions here, with a 4 stroke I would just continue as you are."
686749,Cosmos,2012-04-15 21:31:00,588,"I put Seafoam to my tank all time, exception is winter time. I have 2 stroke."
686751,Woodsman,2012-04-15 21:38:00,1286,2 or 4 stroke SeaFoam is great. It has stabilizer built in plus cleans the carb. I use it in all my motors 2 or 4 stroke including vehicles. In vehicles a couple times a year but small engines all the time.
686759,rufus,2012-04-15 21:48:00,267,Itis my understanding that 4 strokes need to burn premium gas because premium does not contain ethanol and ethanol is said to be bad for 4 strokes. Marinas that don't sell premium recommend Seafoam be used with regular gas. I am guessing it is supposed to counteract the ethanol?
686791,Ainsley,2012-04-15 23:24:00,142,"I used a can at the end of last season because the plugs in my 100hp 1978 Merc had gotten pretty bad and caused the cylinders and pistons to get pretty carboned up. Seemed to clean em out pretty well, I'll probably put another can through when I get it on the water this season."
686797,Muskieman,2012-04-16 00:00:00,2472,"SEAFOAM!!!!   Mechanic in a can..Awesome stuff , I've been using it for about 20 years , nothing negative to say about it .... If it did to me like it does to my engines , I'd drink the stuff.  Randy "
686802,Jer_H,2012-04-16 00:46:00,25,"Thanks guys. The motor has always run great, but it might be worth a shot just to prevent any future problems"
686812,chris.brock,2012-04-16 01:12:00,4053,how did you know the cylinders and pistons were carboned-up? did you take the engine apart?
686818,Ainsley,2012-04-16 01:20:00,142,Pulled the plugs and shined a light inside.
686820,chris.brock,2012-04-16 01:25:00,4053,"that's cool that seafoam cleaned it up, I had never heard of the stuff before reading about it on OFC"
686823,Sinker,2012-04-16 01:27:00,8692,"it cleans everything from the gas tank to the exaust system. Its good stuff! I've never used it in a 4 stroke, but all my two strokes get a regular treatment with it!  S."
686832,krixxer,2012-04-16 01:37:00,274,Who sells the stuff?
686836,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-16 01:40:00,10439," Canadian Tire, Napa.  You want the motor treatment if you're adding to your fuel. Deep creep is for spraying directly into the carb."
686838,Jer_H,2012-04-16 01:44:00,25,"I seems that mainly 2-stroke owners are using. Just to confirm, it's ok for use on 4-strokes, specifically a 2010 115 hp"
686839,Terry,2012-04-16 01:48:00,14456,"you can use it on any engine, even diesel"
686842,krixxer,2012-04-16 01:54:00,274,Canadian Tire??? I'll take a closer look. thanx
686845,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-16 01:58:00,10439,"  Yep, Canadian Tire."
686847,hirk,2012-04-16 02:01:00,571,"I run it in every tank with my 2 stroke, its great for keeping interals and fuel system clean.check the classified if you want some."
686883,Homer Is King,2012-04-16 04:00:00,305,"I used it in my 4 stroke Honda and all my small engines. I treat my gas as soon as I put it in the jerry can. It stabilizes the fuel, controls moisture, and cleans at the same time! It completely turned my engine around last year.  I've heard the the ethanol in gas ages quickly and will gum up engines (especially smaller engines). My engine is only a 7.5 hp so I don't go through a lot of gas and always use high octane. Make sure you check the ethanol content as some companies put ethanol in their high octane gas as well."
686969,Jer_H,2012-04-16 15:05:00,25,I'm gonna go grab some now.  Can't wait to get my boat in the water!  Just not looking foward to having to fill the gas tank  Jeremy
686985,bigbuck,2012-04-16 15:41:00,2449,"It's good stuff. For a 4 stroke, run it at the beginning of the year to clean out the fuel system and engine. I wouldn't use it as a stabilizer, there's been tons of discussion on that in iboats. Use Stabil or the like at the end of the year. Ethanol isn't as bad as it's made out to be, it does act as a solvent and actually cleans out the fuel system in engines, the problem being with older boats and engines built pre 1999 or so is that the fuel lines are not ethanol resistant and it eats the fuel lines. All the new lines are ethanol resistant so with older motors, you may need to replace your lines."
687126,Sinker,2012-04-16 19:44:00,8692,"  Ethanol has many, many more bad qualities than good when it comes to boats and water. It will pull humidity out of the air, and into your gas tank. Many, many problems with boat engines are due to ethanol fuels, and water in the gas. It also leads to phase separation in 2 strokes gas/oil mix.   Seafoam is a great stabilizer. What have you read to think otherwise?? Just curious. I've been using it for about 5 years now. I give my engine a good dose of it in the fall, then add about an ounce per gallon all season long as preventative maintenance. I swear by it. I've seen it fix all sorts of fuel related problems.  It cleans everything from the gas tank, right thru to the exaust.  S."
687152,fishnsled,2012-04-16 20:38:00,3520,I put it in everything.
687227,atvaholic,2012-04-16 23:32:00,271,"The only thing I can say is that on advice from a friend I treated my snowblower with it. It idled very rough (had a surge, then slow down, then surge). its had the problem for years, but it was getting worse.  After treating once, that surge went away. I think I will keep a can around."
