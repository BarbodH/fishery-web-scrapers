687673,boombap,2012-04-17 21:50:00,310,Has anyone ever used a line conditioner like braid-aid or ardent line butter?  I have never tried any but from what I read online it seems that everyone is using some kind of conditioner.  Opinions? Pros? Cons? Dont bother?   Cheers
687680,Dan668,2012-04-17 21:58:00,1120,I use one for fluoro line
687684,boombap,2012-04-17 22:03:00,310, What brand?
687692,Dan668,2012-04-17 22:31:00,1120, kvd line conditioner
687696,kickingfrog,2012-04-17 22:48:00,8333,I bought a bottle of Reel Magic to help reduce line freeze (one of it's claims). Can't say I noticed a difference. I don't use main-line floro or mono much. When the bottle runs out I may try something else.
687874,Fisher_1,2012-04-18 13:21:00,22,I tried the KVD line conditioner this season and I notice i slight increase in casting distance not much but its there. and it seems to retrieve abit nicer.
687885,Roy,2012-04-18 14:09:00,13728,"Can't believe people would fall for that.  Whatever happened to the simple times when all you needed was a Loomis stick, a sustain, a few gammas and a can of worms?"
687902,adempsey,2012-04-18 14:45:00,1498," I did the same for my ice fishing gear, but used KVD line conditioner.  Not sure if I noticed a difference (I fish outside of a hut).  Regardless, it wasn't enough for me to continue to use it."
688007,Garnet,2012-04-18 19:11:00,2056,"I've used Reel Magic for 25 years. Line freeze helps, keeps your line floating pretty good keeps your line soft and pliable in below freezing. Definitely worth the effort.  Never tried the KVD stuff because it's never on sale and way pricy."
