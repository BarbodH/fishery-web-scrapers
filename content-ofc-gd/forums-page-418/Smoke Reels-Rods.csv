687896,Lunker777,2012-04-18 14:31:00,866,I posted this message last year sometime... and I think it was a little to soon.  So... how are these reels and rods holding up ?  I don't like to read online reviews because I don't fully trust them !
687950,uglyfish,2012-04-18 17:03:00,981,"I have a smoke casting reel, its held up extremely well to my abuse. Very smooth reel, I use it on my jerkbait rod, landed a ton of smallies on it last year with no issues.  Haven't used the rods or spinning reels, but guys I know that have had nuthin but good things to say"
688221,Raycaster,2012-04-19 02:12:00,528," Was itching for a new spinning rod and sure had my eye on the Smoke Reel. Visited a local tackle store to check it out but the small size and ""open gears"" had me hestitating. The engineering felt great but still couldn't get over being able to see the internal gears. Probably just paranoid but kept thinking of the gunk that would find its way in...  Went with the tried and true Shimano Stradic 3000FJ. Boring, but I'll blame it on age."
