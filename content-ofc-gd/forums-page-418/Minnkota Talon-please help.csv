687359,mugsmuffin,2012-04-17 11:20:00,17,"I have a 2011 Crestliner CX19, I also purchased a Minnkota Talon to mount on it. The problem I have is that there is no access to the inside of the transom at that point where it needs to be mounted, has any body else ran into this problem?  Any help would be greatly appreciated"
687364,Roy,2012-04-17 11:34:00,13728,Have you read all of the mounting instructions? There's also another mounting bracket available which might be the one you need.  I just had a quick look at the instructions and it seems doable. http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CEIQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minnkotamotors.com%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D63235&ei=0VKNT9P-Ksbo0QHWsoC1Dw&usg=AFQjCNFlaCbhy9QwX7vQyxeTy48xIMKYuQ
