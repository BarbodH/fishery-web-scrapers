Now usually when we go out to camp or cottages I can find loads of information on fishing spots and maps however Wolfe Island was drawing up nothing in google!  My buddy says there are nice pike and bass fishing there, but he was young when he had last went so has no clue whereabouts they may be.  I was wondering if anyone has ever gone fishing there and if they have, whether you have any insight on some good spots?  We will have access to a 14' aluminium boat so any insight as to what to look out for and use as well would be great.  Thanks in advance!  Cheers,  Jon"
