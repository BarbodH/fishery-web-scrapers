446677,landry,2010-03-23 00:49:00,1005,I am thinking about buying a 1600 fish hawk with  50 merc on it. I am concerned about the power needed for this boat. Does anyone own or fish from one of these with the 50 hp on it? Do they plane well and what speeds will they hit? Do people like the 50 merc 2 strokes (newer models)? I have an older 1650 with a 70 hp 4 stroke and it runs really well but I am thinking of buying a brand new one with the 50!?! Thanks a ton! Landry
446686,danbouck,2010-03-23 00:56:00,4380,I have a 16.5 footer with a 50 4 stroke and it pushes me to 30mph.
446690,landry,2010-03-23 01:02:00,1005,"Oh ya - the fish hawks are little wider and heavier than many other alums - 87"" beam / 880 lbs. Need feedback soon. Thanks"
446692,danbouck,2010-03-23 01:04:00,4380,"mine is an 82"" beam and 995lbs"
446700,Paudash,2010-03-23 01:10:00,273,"I have a Crestline Canadian edition, very simular boat and I run a Yamaha 40 4 stroke and it runs great.  These are very light boats so a 50hp should be fine"
446703,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-23 01:10:00,348,"I have a 1650 SportFish, 2006...love it. Although it has a 90 hp 4 stroke on it. I love Crestliners"

446856,Scott S,2010-03-23 06:29:00,203,"I have the 1600 fish hawk with the 50 2stroke. The gps say 32 mph with 2 big guys in the boat. It rides awsome, no problem planing.Unless you into speed the 50hp is lot's of motor for the boat Scooter"
446873,Jer,2010-03-23 11:07:00,1426,"What's the max HP rating for the boat?  I have a 1600 Angler (2004) rated for 75hp with an 84"" beam and a hull weight of 860 lbs. I have a 70hp 2 stroke on the back and that works fine but certainly isn't crazy fast, maybe 37 or 38 mph fully trimmed on smooth water. I don't know how the boat would perform with only a 50, you want to get as close to the max as possible."
446911,getnjiggywithit,2010-03-23 13:26:00,18,I had a sportfish 1650 with a 115 efi fourstroke that worked well! It planed out perfectly tones of bowlift and a nice dry ride! The boat with two guys loaded with gear would do 47mph with a regular aluminum prop!  I now have a fishhawk 1850 with a 150 optimax and have a problem with it! The problem is when I'm on plane I can't get any bow lift. As soon as I tried to trim out the prop would blow out of the water! So the dealer tried lowering the engine and it was better but not even close the where it should be! Over the summer I tried differant props and engine hieghts and was never able to get it to run properly.  I should also mention that I get wet from the spray every time out!  I put a straight edge on the bottom of the hull and lets just say it wasn't straight!  The boat has been sent back to the factory so they can figure out the problem! This is a pic of the boat trimmed out at WOT   A tip for anyone buying a welded boat! Bring a 3-4foot straight edge with you and make sure the hull is straight before you buy!
447147,landry,2010-03-23 21:02:00,1005,Thanks guys. Very helpful! The 50 sounds like it will do okay. My wife thinks I am insane cause I have a 2003 with a 70 hp 4 stroke that runs perfect! I am just debating buying a new boat and whether or not that is smart or just extravagant seeing as mine is running well. I can't lose either way I guess. Landry
447158,danbouck,2010-03-23 21:25:00,4380,I would stick with what you have
447295,Radnine,2010-03-24 00:03:00,1538,"I have a 1600 fish hawk with the 60 4 stroke. I think the best that I can do with me and my gear is about 34 on the GPS. So 30 on a fifty sounds about right. I have to ask, to what do you think you are upgrading? Jim"
447299,Radnine,2010-03-24 00:10:00,1538," Who is your dealer? If it isn't Proctor it should be (and, no I don't care where you live  ). Good luck, I am sure that Crestliner will put it right! Jim"
447393,landry,2010-03-24 02:11:00,1005," I am fully aware that I would not be upgrading - what I would be getting is new but louder, slightly slower engine and an equivalent boat. I am just thinking the boat would be trouble free for many years (hopefully) with no surprises - which isn't guaranteed but I would think more likely than with a 2003. And yes my 2003 runs perfectly. I should probably just leave it be and enjoy what I have. Maybe I need professional help!!! Landry"
447958,getnjiggywithit,2010-03-25 11:30:00,18,This might help you out http://www.mercurymarine.com/look_deeper/boat_house_bulletin.php?ID=436&SortBy=Title&Section=outboardChecks&fourStroke2515=9&fourStroke2530=10&fourStroke4060=11&fourStroke75115=12&hp5090150efi=20 [url/] My 2005 1650 sportangler originally came with a merc 75 four stroke and the boat did 42mph I swapped the 75 for a 115 and only gained only 5-7mph  Both the 75 and 115 use the same block!  I now have the 150 optimax and kinda wish i'd bought a fourstroke! hope it helps
447973,Jer,2010-03-25 12:30:00,1426,"   A 150 on a 1650 SportAngler?  Do ya think you may be a bit overpowered?...or worse, to heavy at the back end?  That boat can't be rated for anymore than a 115 I would think."
447987,getnjiggywithit,2010-03-25 13:01:00,18,  The 150opti is on a fishhawk 1850 next to a 9.9 prokicker! completly differant boat!
448087,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-25 19:19:00,348,"That would be crazy. The max rating on the 1650 Sportangler is 90, which is what I went for. Even then, the back end is a little too heavy. "
448168,Jer,2010-03-25 22:55:00,1426,  Well ya shoulda said so in the first place...
448374,getnjiggywithit,2010-03-26 11:30:00,18," Back in 2005 the boat was rated for 115hp!  In 2006 the rateing changed to 90HP!  75,90,115 All weigh around the same as they use the same block!"
448929,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-27 23:45:00,4399,"There seems to be a lot 16/17 foot Crestliners, Lund`s etc. for sale with 50 two strokes on them both new and used. Is the two stroke making a comeback?? People missing the smell of fossil fuel in the morning!!"
448945,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-28 00:09:00,348,"That's interesting. I was told by the dealer that the Block is the same on the 75 and 90, but not the 115hp.  What I find interesting, is even though the blocks may be the same, the size of the motors aren't. I bought my boat new in 2006, but it was a new 2005 model. There was one identical with a 75hp on it, sitting right beside mine and it certainly looked smaller. I couldn't imagine what the 115 would look like!  Here's a question...Just because the block is the same, does that mean that the weight of the entire motor is the same? (sans sarcasm, serious question  ) "
