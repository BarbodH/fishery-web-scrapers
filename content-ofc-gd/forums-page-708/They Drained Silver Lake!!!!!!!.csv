447472,skeeter,2010-03-24 05:30:00,1907,"talk about pulling the plug..... take a run out and see what you can find..fish, boats, atv's i will watch for your yard sale signs..  LOL"
447509,brifishrgy,2010-03-24 11:39:00,559,info here  looks like they did it back in January
447583,Sugarpacket,2010-03-24 14:21:00,82,thanks  brifishrgy my ex just told me i knew it was supposed to happen before i moved out here i just didnt think it was actually gona happen. Its a shame how much distruction can happen from a stupid rowing club
448135,livinisfishin,2010-03-25 21:43:00,661,Was there good populations of fish in this lake? How many acres in size was it?
448212,ch312,2010-03-25 23:56:00,1590,"not too much information in that article. but, when they mentioned that the dam was deteriorated quite badly, i assumed they were just doing repairs on the dam?  anyone have more info?"
448218,ch312,2010-03-26 00:01:00,1590,http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2227090  its just for repairs and will likely be back up in the summer. no need to worry unless the worst case scenario of being drained for 4 years happens.  it is not the rowing club that is causing destruction. the article says that the rowing club uses the lake for training so it doesnt make sense for them to want the lake drained. draining the lake is the most cost effective way of repairing the dam...
448221,purekgw,2010-03-26 00:06:00,585,i hope it dosnt affect the carp fishing there
448224,brifishrgy,2010-03-26 00:10:00,559,  if its empty ..chances are the carp arent there
448226,purekgw,2010-03-26 00:13:00,585,"not in silver lake but the river below the dam they would head up there in the spring in the masses, but with to running water would they still go in there?"
448233,brifishrgy,2010-03-26 00:23:00,559,  they should .. the water level below the dam should be the same .. just wont be any flow so the carp should still be there .. maybe even more then before
448236,danbouck,2010-03-26 00:29:00,4380, Sweet a new spot   Thanks
448261,Norfolker,2010-03-26 01:01:00,1,"The damn work is only temporary.  They attempted to fix the damn last year by diverting water down the one flu but unfortunately one of the workers got electrocuted while they were installing the air bladder.  The MOL determined it was too dangerous to proceed that way so they have no choice but to drain the lake.  The dam is in VERY poor condition and the fear was that it would suddenly burst causing major issues for the marinas, cottages etc.. downstream  The rowing club fiercely contested the draining but eventually realized it would be for the best.  I hear they may be moving to either Deer Creek or to Tillsonburg for a couple years."
448262,Terry,2010-03-26 01:07:00,14456,"I don't know how big it is but I would be walking round GPSing every rock, tree. drop off or anything else that might hold a fish then try fishing them once the water comes back and if the fish come back"
448641,Sugarpacket,2010-03-27 02:37:00,82,"the rowing club took out a point that stopped the current because it was in their way, which caused silt to build up making the lake no longer deep enough so they first planed to dredge it but if they did that the dam wouldnt have held and they couldnt find the owner so they had closed it off from fishing hoping the owners would come out of the wood work but last i had heard they hadnt."
