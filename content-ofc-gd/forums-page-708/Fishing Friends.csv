Anyway, I'm from Hamilton mountain, just looking for a buddy or some buddies to go out and well of course catch some fish, I am not a float or fly fisherman as I don't have the equipment, but I would like to catch any species."

I wanted to respond because I am glad that you have found this site and didn't want you to think that we are not looking for fishing partners, or are a bunch of snobby terds. Keep an eye open for various fishing activities that members run, some for charity and some for the sake of getting together. If you are not a float or fly guy, you are okay by me and welcome to marry my sister anytime! (Marry your sister Sir? Absolutely! you should hear the noise she makes when she eats a boiled egg. Bonus points for anyone that can identify that exchange). Anyway, welcome and keep your eyes peeled for future get togethers. Jim"
