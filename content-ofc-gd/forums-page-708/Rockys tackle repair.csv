448689,kickingfrog,2010-03-27 08:28:00,8333,I've got a couple of reels that could use some TLC beyond what I am capable to giving them. Can they tune other brands? What about non-Quantum rod repairs?
448749,vance,2010-03-27 14:05:00,719,"They also do warranty on Shakespeare,johnson,mitchell,zebco,abu garcia,okuma,diawa,rapala and quantum reels they might do more but the business card I have is 4-5 years old.More than likely they can TLC anything,I had him look at my dad's pflueger reel from the 40s but he couldn't get a handle for it.   vance"
