448437,batoathome,2010-03-26 16:29:00,47,BLACKBERRY APP.  would be nice!!
448445,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-26 16:45:00,10439,  Sure would!!!!
448447,Grimace,2010-03-26 16:47:00,2020, I am a mobile user during the day.  I use the iPhone.  Titles for threads do not have the page numbers under them so you can't go directly to the last page.  Other than that it is gold man.  Loads super quick.
448452,ADB,2010-03-26 16:58:00,444,How do you access the mobile version?  My Blackberry just sends me to the regular site.
448456,Grimace,2010-03-26 17:03:00,2020," iPhone is on auto pilot in that respect.  It just comes up that way.  If I go into address box and type it in it will obey. If you click on a link it will send you to mobile first.  I would do a search for OFC mobile and see what comes up.  The new version of OFC mobile is way better than last one.  I would not use the last one.  I just went to normal site, but this one is super quick."
448457,Spiel,2010-03-26 17:07:00,9065," Well I'm not a mobile user but have you tried scrolling down to the bottom of the page, lower left corner where it says ""IP Board"" with a drop down menu.  Click the drop down menu and select ""IP Board - Lo-Fi""  May or may not help......"
448463,ADB,2010-03-26 17:16:00,444, That works!  Thanks.

448478,Spiel,2010-03-26 18:31:00,9065,  LOL....That's what 16 months off work will do to you.  
448486,justwannafish,2010-03-26 19:07:00,82, I would most definetly benefit from a mobile format!!! I am barely home around my computer so I'm constantly using my phone for any Internet usage I may have. I would absolutely love a mobile format (an iPhone app springs to mind and I can guarantee I'd pay for it!) so I can keep up to date with what's goin on in the angling world no matter where I am. Great idea! I really hope the demand is enough for this to take affect soon!!
448487,cityfisher,2010-03-26 19:15:00,959,"i use an iphone and find OFC mobile a tab plain, the good thing is you can switch between the two."

448595,Grimace,2010-03-27 00:45:00,2020, Thanks man.    Your battery is getting low :-)
448676,bigfish1965,2010-03-27 04:46:00,3382,"Okay I will do the touch software. I do not know how to make an app for iPhones, but if anyone does, I will be glad to render assistance and work out a licensing agreement. I also found a sleek Mobile skin for only ten bucks!!! Gimme a few days to find some code for an auto-redirect and I will add a new URL... maybe m.ofncommunity.com or OFC.commmunity.com/m/"
