447916,JoshS,2010-03-25 03:49:00,729,Was out today fishing some Lake O pike. Didn't even entice a follow today. Pike are in full spawn mode and I noticed many males and females paired up. I think the window for pre-spawn pike is shut. It was only a couple days ago I was catching some pre-spawn females. Now hopefully some big girls will still be around in May!
448106,ehg,2010-03-25 20:41:00,2666,Thanks for the little report. Have to try down there before the season closes for a bit after Mar. 31st. Might be something biting who knows
448164,Stoty,2010-03-25 22:51:00,2910,"I was down there last weekend, and did pretty well. Managed 10 fish, ranging from 3-8lbs ish. No monsters though. I am planning on going Saturday again. Hopefully the big females co-operate!"
448169,ciscokid,2010-03-25 22:56:00,52,"Ive never fished pike before the season re opens in late may, but yea that is one of my favorite times of year and u can still catch the big fish shallow. Id imagine tho that u could still get them to bite when theyre spwning, did u try big flashy lures to piss them off. I think they are territorial and would hit them. I wouldnt mind giving pre spawn pike a try tho, problem is where i fish the ice isnt off the lake till the season closes. I live in toronto tho so i could always give lake O a try, too bad i missed out this year."
448417,fish-miester,2010-03-26 15:01:00,864,where did you launch out of.. I was out there and had a few follow but didnt land any either
448455,ADB,2010-03-26 17:01:00,444,"I was the Islands last Saturday.  The water level was really low.  We didn't even see a fish.  A few other guys were walking the shores too, but nothing for them either."
