448769,Tybo,2010-03-27 14:59:00,1373,"Can't find what I need from the jiberish on Google. All my manuals are at work. The studs are 9/16"" on aluminium rims. I know on 5/8"" stud on aluminium is 110lbs and 65lbs on 1/2"". Also know it's 450lbs 0n a 15/16""x28 studs.  Can't even remember the last time I use 13/16""."
448774,BillM,2010-03-27 15:10:00,17367,I like to use 'snug + 1/4 turn' when the torque ratings aren't available.
448777,Spiel,2010-03-27 15:15:00,9065,"Ooops, my bad! I thought this was going to be about winter hats."
448779,wuchikubo,2010-03-27 15:21:00,1114,"Gee, I thought the same thing, was interested on what kind of toque or hat warmnest rating was in place."
448780,skeeter,2010-03-27 15:22:00,1907,WHAT... you mean its not about hats? 
448781,bigugli,2010-03-27 15:23:00,6138,I thought this was a Bob and Doug moment. Even got out the back bacon and beers
448782,bigfish1965,2010-03-27 15:23:00,3382,I'd give her one good toque... 
448783,Terry,2010-03-27 15:25:00,14456,good thing there is an R in trip I was thinking something else for a second
448785,dannyboy,2010-03-27 15:27:00,367,"You guys and your fetishes!  For 9/16 studs 75-80 ft/lbs on aluminum, 135-140 on steel.  Dan"
448787,SlowPoke,2010-03-27 15:30:00,2984,135-145 according to Tire Rack http://www.tirerack.com/wheels/tech/techpage.jsp?techid=107
448789,SlowPoke,2010-03-27 15:33:00,2984," I think ""75-80"" refers to aluminium studs, not grade 8 studs to aluminium wheels."
448790,dannyboy,2010-03-27 15:36:00,367,"Be sure to check that you have the right nut for the aluminum rim, they are sometimes shouldered as opposed to the cone type.  Dan"
448791,SlowPoke,2010-03-27 15:37:00,2984,"Actually, the correct answer is... As tight as Joey can get it while you enjoy a cool beverage on the side of the road."
448795,skeeter,2010-03-27 15:43:00,1907,oh boy. slow poke you are going to get your    kicked now....  hey joey--please wait till lakeair to do it. i will be selling tickets for that one  and you guys thought the UFC was good..   LOL
448829,HTHM,2010-03-27 17:12:00,4082,Yet another reason to go to Lakair!
448836,Tybo,2010-03-27 17:29:00,1373,"SlowPoke: The reason I need the right torque. Is to make it easy as possible for Joey To get the wheel off.      Too funny that I spelt torque wrong, When I wright it down in the shop book a couple dozen times a week."
448858,Fisherman,2010-03-27 19:33:00,7201," Aluminum studs? I'll buy aluminum wheels/rims, but not studs. I think your Toque is Torqued on too tight,"
