448524,DMASSE,2010-03-26 21:58:00,420,"Hello  Its been awhile since I have posted a fishing report,  I have been out many time in the last couple weeks, fishing rivers out east, local and a couple of north of Barrie rivers...  Todays report is a local report of Toronto, we went less than 45 minutes from my door and had this little creek all to ourselves... I personally went 6-7 rainbows with the largest just over 25 inches  Here are some of the pics for the day, all fish were released to fight again and all caught on rainbow roe..  I hope you enjoy          this one is from Monday "
