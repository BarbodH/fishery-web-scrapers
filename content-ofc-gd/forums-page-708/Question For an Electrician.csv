445527,shane,2010-03-19 19:28:00,652,I saw this on a movie once.  Turned out they had a ghost. And not a friendly one. Hope this isn't your problem.
445578,Tybo,2010-03-19 21:16:00,1373,One of your major appliances have a higher then normal amperage draw. Could be you furnace also. With a good chance a loose ground at the box or the pole.. With  the problem being in different sockets.
445583,Gerritt,2010-03-19 21:22:00,6129,are these lights all on the same circuit?.. is there a possibility of a drywall screw threw the line itself causing the voltage change?  I have seen more then one drywall screw through electrical wire causing mayhem  G.
445737,HTHM,2010-03-20 01:28:00,4082,That would show up when he does a continuity or a voltage test from (ground - hot) or (white - hot).

Or stop doing your own electrical work.(just kidding)  Anyways just read ur post and I think there is a lot of missing information for example.  whats the house like area wiring copper alunion knob and tube etc etc etc  if you want free help then you gotta be more detailed  Cheers,  Todd"
445758,irishfield,2010-03-20 02:01:00,26272,Not sure who you're referring to as wanna be's Todd... but there's a least three responders there with a license and an Electro/Mech PEng in there to boot as well...
445849,Tinman,2010-03-21 16:50:00,376," Pretty sure if you read back i put all that, you'll find that my house is older, in an established neighbor hood, with a breaker panel, and copper wiring. And i am not looking for ""free"" help. Just a starting point on whether its something I can do myself or whether i do have to contact someone. This is a forum where you can detail a problem you may have, no matter what the issue may be, such as fishing, homestuff or personal issues. Also the fact that there are guys that are licensed in some trade or another, that depending on the problem can help you out or even come over and do it for you. I myself am a licensed HVAC contractor and have offered my help to some others over time. Hopefully this didn't sound rude or angry. Typing doesn't tell ya what expression you are feeling at the time lol"
448355,toca,2010-03-26 06:08:00,274, Who do you think im talkin about?
448356,bigfish1965,2010-03-26 06:16:00,3382,"Had the same issue at my old place. First starting using the 'country bulbs' which lasted longer, then finally went to the compact fluorescent bulbs and the problem went away...well the problem didn't but the results did."
448357,toca,2010-03-26 06:17:00,274," You forgot to mention the light fixtures.  Style(flush, recessed) Type ( pots, low voltage, etc) What kind of switch mechanism are they on   Etc.  ReT0dd"
448593,Baldy,2010-03-27 00:43:00,44,"Incandescent lamp failure is usually a result of overvoltage, bad connection (causing arcing & excess heat) or age of lamp. Check the voltage with a proper voltmeter, hot wire to ground, and if it is at or above 120V then 130V lamps may cure the problem. If voltage is below 120V then remove the lampholder and check the terminations.  If the terminations are loose tighten them and check the conductor insulation for signs of drying out due to the excess heat. Could also be a bad batch of lamps. Another cure, as mentioned above, is to replace all of your lamps with compact fluorescent lamps.  They are available in different wattages, will handle a wider range of voltages and will also lower your energy costs. Most of the advice you have received has merit, however after 40 years in the trade (licensed in 1975, master license in 1980, registered contractor with ECRA/ESA) I know that your problem is not unique.  It may not hurt to contact a local electrical contractor as you may not be the only person in your neighborhood with this issue. Best of luck. You are too far away or I would consider trading services."
448635,Tinman,2010-03-27 02:23:00,376," I appreciate that, i am having an electrician i met on site this week come out and take a look, then i have to look at possibley replacing his a/c. Thanks for all the advice guys, i'll let you know what he said"
448655,fish_fishburn,2010-03-27 02:57:00,1311,Probably a loose connection at the pole. I saw this just recently at a neighbours up the street. We did a meter test on a few receptacles and the reading were bouncing all over the place.  He called hydro and they came the next day and it was a loose connection at the pole.
445203,Tinman,2010-03-18 23:52:00,376,"Hey guys, i have a question for and electrician. This is a little out of my heating experience lol, I am blowing light bulbs at the rate of 5 or so a week in different sockets around the house. I have made sure that they are not over the limit for the wattage and have even started to switch to flourescents, any ideas?  Thanks Denis"
445208,cheaptackle,2010-03-18 23:59:00,849,"I'm not a licensed electrican but do have some background in it.  Sounds like loose connections to me.  Ever tightened up all the terminals (breaker, commons & grounds) screws at your main panel?  Especially on older homes this will help a lot.  What else is on the circuit?  Are all the lights on the same circuit?  Michael"
445232,irishfield,2010-03-19 00:40:00,26272,House built with silent beam floors? Vibration... try a couple work bulbs in the lamps that keep blowing bulbs.  Are you end of the line.. voltage surge. I have to put 130V bulbs in our outside lights or they're toast in less than a month with us being the last place on the concession road. Our voltage is regularily 121 volts with surges to 135.
445242,Whopper,2010-03-19 00:47:00,2174,Good answer Wayne  Yesterday I couldn't even spell electrician now I are one
445251,Tinman,2010-03-19 01:20:00,376,"not the end of the line for sure, we are in the centre of a large older subdivision. Its is an older house that was converted about 5 years ago from fuses to a breaker panel,"
445254,vance,2010-03-19 01:27:00,719,"I know from experience that this sure sounds like loose connections mainly at the fuse panel-ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ALUMINUM WIRING.I had a similar problem and finally and had to change all the receptacles and switches in the house to cure it.If I were you I would get an electrician in to check things out,you have no idea the STUPID things that previous owners can do.  vance"
445258,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-19 01:34:00,2038,Loose connections x 3
445260,cheaptackle,2010-03-19 01:38:00,849,"How old Tinman?  Is there ground wires?  You might want to kill a breaker & pull out an outlet to see for yourself that there are ground wires coming into the box, not that the outlet is just grounded to the box. If the conversion was done 5 years ago it would be about the right time to tighten all connections.  IF you do have aluminum make sure all your devices are either al or cu/al rated (it'll be printed on the switches & outlets body).  I'd be surprised,  though, if you had aluminum simply because if the panel was upgraded the wiring should have been as well.  I'd be equally surprised for the same reason if you still had old style ungrounded romex wire.  I thought Wayne had nailed it for you with the voltage fluctuations until you responded.  Let us know what you find.  Michael"
445270,gdelongchamp,2010-03-19 02:23:00,199,"Did you buy your lightbulbs from Walmart?  Are the bulbs you are using to replace the existing bulbs all from the same maker? or the samer package? Check the electrical foot contact on the bulb itself, if it is very flat then it is not contatcting the end of the socket adequately when screwed in which resulsts in arcing and accelerated life of the bulb. This is a common problem with Walmart bulbs. Start with this before you call out an electrician. Particularly if you have not always been having this problem."
445271,gdelongchamp,2010-03-19 02:29:00,199,"In addition to my last posting, check the tab inside of the socket, somtimes it has been pushed back and does not make proper contact with the electric foot contact on the bulb. You can pull it back a bit using needle nose pliers but make sure the power is off."
445272,Tinman,2010-03-19 02:30:00,376,"the wiring definately has been replaced, THe bulbs i originally bought were slvania's. Light tonite, turned on the front hall light both bulbs in the the fixture blew, all the fixtures in the house were replaced before we moved in as well. I am going to start pulling them apart to take a peek"
445274,irishfield,2010-03-19 02:32:00,26272,Get your digital meter out and stick it in a recepticle! How many volts...
445279,Tinman,2010-03-19 02:38:00,376,"Been a little shy of electricity as of late, got a great big shock last week on a commercial roof top lol"
445281,gdelongchamp,2010-03-19 02:52:00,199,You can try bulbs from a different maker before doing anything else. Opening up the fixtures will most likely not reveal any problem. Your next step would be to check the voltage and the current in the circuits. Are you having any problems with your wall receptacles or appliances  throughout the house? For ease of mind I would get an electrician in. In the meantime make sure all of your smoke detectors are working properly. Let us know the results ok>
445283,irishfield,2010-03-19 02:55:00,26272,  I've been dead twice.. once from 600 in grade 12 electicity (when my partner turned the panel back on after the teacher had turned it off) and once from 3600 in a damp glass plant (when the feed buss filled with ice and shorted out to the frame work and we were turning the power back on after a Christmas shut down) ... hell I can lick 110 ..it won't hurt you! lol
445285,HTHM,2010-03-19 03:09:00,4082,Go ahead and lick 110 with your feet in water or well grounded. Its not volts that kill you it is amps!
445287,irishfield,2010-03-19 03:12:00,26272," Na it's all relative Albert! AC cycles thru zero at least... it's DC you really have to give thought to. We call it Dead Current for a reason..  I'm hoping tinman grabs his meter... I bet he has high voltage in the house and the other thought, first floor ceiling.. kids running around up stairs in bedrooms??"
445288,HTHM,2010-03-19 03:13:00,4082,"As well, if you do have alum wiring, i would suggest treaqting all connections with NO-Lux it is anti-oxidizing agent that will preserve the wire connection's integrity. There is nothing wrong with alum wiring as a conductor, (Hydro uses it for primarys), just the terminations are the problem. Just my opinion, I have no certificates just some training at college."
445291,irishfield,2010-03-19 03:23:00,26272,Another thought... did an industrial electrician rewire your house?? They are so use to keeping neutral and ground seperate downstream from the main switch gear that they have a habit of doing it in homes as well. If neutral isn't grounded in the panel properly and out to  your ground rod... you could have an unbalanced centre tap for neutral causing higher voltage than you should get at a plug/fixture.
445320,dannyboy,2010-03-19 04:32:00,367,"Floating ground, check the voltage at the outlets.  Dan"
445359,Tinman,2010-03-19 11:37:00,376,"  It was a 2 phase a/c so 220 first time it happend lots of noise and light and a little pain, was bruise on my shoulder from where i grounded out against the unit.  I'll definately check the voltage in the lights before ripping them apart."
445374,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-19 12:11:00,0,220 single phase double pole......   not 2 phase.  Love home electricians.   Sounds like you may indeed have a loose neutral wire at the panel or even at the pole outside. You may need an electrician or even Hydro to come and have a look. Check the voltage like most have said and see for yourself.
445378,Jer,2010-03-19 12:20:00,1426,"  You should have 0V from the neutral side of the circuit to ground (any ground, including any copper plumbing and metal fixtures) and 110 - 120V from the hot side to both the neutral and the ground."
445384,dave524,2010-03-19 12:34:00,4508,They used to market light bulbs for rural locations that handle higher line voltages. Power company typically has higher voltages on the lines in rural areas due to line loss between widely spaced customers. Might help if everything else checks out.
445499,Tinman,2010-03-19 17:51:00,376,"  Actually not a home electrician, but ok lol"
