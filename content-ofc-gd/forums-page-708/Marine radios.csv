449021,Dara,2010-03-28 03:29:00,3052,I saw this advertised in Ontario outdoors. Being as I have been considering getting one but not wanting to spend a bunch of money I ordered this.  http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPath=3_118&products_id=5255  It said limited quantities so I jumped on it. I figure I can cancel Monday if its not worth it. I won't use it lots but being as I may be a piece away from home I figure its a safety item. plus maybe talking to a few people about where the fish are. Any opinions..is it a waste of $80.00?

449066,Fisherman,2010-03-28 12:24:00,7201,"They usually go for about $140+ so it's a very good deal, just don't scrimp on the antenna."
449075,canadadude,2010-03-28 12:51:00,769,"Thats a great deal and you won't be sorry you installed on your boat. I personally think all boats fishing big water should have a marine radio there a very valuable tool and can help you out of an emegency situation. Here on the Lake Ontario we use them constantly for weather updates and to keep in touch with the other fisher's, lots of times my buddies have helped me out and put me on fish and like wise I do the same. I don't think you'll be diappointed with this purchase and that is a great price now just match it up with a good antenna which will be close to the same price."
