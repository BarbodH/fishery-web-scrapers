Jeff Bridges can sure play a guitar and sing a mean country tune. And Colin Farrell - who woulda thought!  Bridges got the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance... and probably deservedly so, although I can't recall who else was in the running.  Three excellent songs, written for the movie, and performed by Bridges:  Hold on You I Don't Know Fallin and Flyin (my favourite)  They're as good as country gets. Written by T Bone Burnett, I think.  Anyone interested in how to get the sound track... PM me. "
