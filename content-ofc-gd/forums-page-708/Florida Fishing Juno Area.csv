I plan to spend a lot of time on the Juno Pier or renting a boat and doing some near shore fishing.  If anyone knows anything about the area, local tackle shops, and possible tips, it would be greatly appreciated!  BL"

With the economy in the dumps you could get a charter for a few hundred bucks for Marlin and other sport fish. We were out for about 5 hours, caught some Tuna, King Makerels, Barracudas and 1 blue fin tuna. Had a Marlin on the line, but he broke loose. We were about 2 miles off shore. If you can afford it -  arrange it awesome experience! Our boat was Marlin My Darling - great tour on a 36 ft Cape Hatteras cruiser. Wish I could go with you!"
