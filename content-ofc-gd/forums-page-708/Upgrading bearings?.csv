448806,bassman87,2010-03-27 16:08:00,586,what kind of reel? i know bocabearings.com sells alot of bearings and tonnes of sizes and applications
448808,sandmann,2010-03-27 16:14:00,51,"Thanks for the info, I already checked that site out, was hopeing to find somewhere local. There for curado100D's"
448812,bassman87,2010-03-27 16:24:00,586,bring it to your local tackle shop and see what they can do/get done for you
448817,dannyboy,2010-03-27 16:31:00,367,"Mike's Reel Repair sells bearings and bearing kits along with many other great upgrades, they even have a bearing that replaces one of the bushes in the Curado  Dan"
448834,HTHM,2010-03-27 17:16:00,4082,It is possible that the bearings may just need a good cleaning and lube job. Perhaps look at that before spending the money on new bearings
448837,sandmann,2010-03-27 17:45:00,51,"I'd rather do it my self, from what Ive heard its really simple. Might be a good idea to see if they sell them though. Thanks"
448841,sandmann,2010-03-27 17:47:00,51,"The reels I have are brand new, I want to try upgrading with better bearings, I hear there are some out there that make a huge differnce."
448847,Garry2Rs,2010-03-27 18:12:00,1425,"Kevin at Pro reel Service in Wichita KS told me that the ARB bearings, once they have been tuned, are the best stainlees bearings you can buy.  The best ceramic bearings are the Boca Orange seal.  Both of these bearings coat about $14.00 each installed.  You would need two. Since a new Curado comes with ARB, don't change the bearings. Box the reel up and mail it to; PROFESSIONAL REEL SERVICE 2103 N Teal Brook CT Wichita KS 67235  Ask them for their Pro Tuning. It costs less than $20 per reel.  It includes cleaning and some machining to smooth the work surfaces and tuning of the bearings. This will make a bigger difference to your reel than just swapping out the bearings and it will cost less. Garry2R's."
