Well, when they came back to cross that plank, it was floating and so were they. Farther and farther each minute, out and away from shore. It so happens that Slyatv was out on a sales call selling a wilcraft of course. Luck for them they all got a ride back to safe ice courtesy of Shane. Nice job Sly and good for you helping out as usual."

448862,Big Cliff,2010-03-27 20:05:00,6899,One of the nicest young men I have ever met! I'll never forget the day he helped Beans and I and would take nothing in return. The mold got broken after he was made!
448866,Terry,2010-03-27 20:29:00,14456,Good on him  wilcraft to the rescue
448867,BillM,2010-03-27 20:33:00,17367,"Man, there are a lot of stupid people out there."
448886,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-27 21:37:00,0,  Truthfully. They all would have gone home with out the ride. Just all wet and cold from their little swim is all. I would have had a great laugh knowing most of them and knowing each went swimming for some Perch...  .  Ice is unsafe at all times of the year. I'm pretty sure there's some out there right now. In a Wilcraft....
