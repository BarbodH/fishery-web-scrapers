The farmer agreed to deliver the mule the next day. The next morning the farmer drove up and said, ""Sorry, fellers, I have some bad news, the mule died last night.""   Curtis & Leroy replied, ""Well, then just give us our money back..""  The farmer said, ""Can't do that. I went and spent it already.""  They said, ""OK then, just bring us the dead mule.""  The farmer asked, ""What in the world ya'll gonna do with a dead mule?""  Curtis said, ""We gonna raffle him off.""  The farmer said, ""You can't raffle off a dead mule!""  Leroy said, ""We shore can!  Heck, we don't hafta tell nobody he's dead!""  A couple of weeks later, the farmer ran into Curtis & Leroy at the Co-Op grocery store and asked:  ""What'd you fellers ever do with that dead mule?"" They said,""We raffled him off like we said we wuz gonna do.""  Leroy said,""Shucks, we sold 500 tickets fer two dollars apiece and made a profit of $898.""  The farmer said,""My Lord, didn't anyone complain?""  Curtis said, ""Well, the feller who won got upset. So we gave him his two dollarsback.""  Curtis and Leroy now work for the government.

Playing with his toys in her bedroom while grandma was dusting, he looked up and said,  ""Grandma, how come you don't have a boyfriend now that Grandpa went to heaven?"" Grandma replied, ""Honey, my TV is my boyfriend. I can sit in my bedroom  and watch it all day long. The religious programs make me feel good and  the comedies make me laugh. I'm happy with my TV as my boyfriend.""  Grandma turned on the TV, and the reception was terrible. She started  adjusting the knobs, trying to get the picture in focus. Frustrated, she  started hitting the backside of the TV hoping to fix the problem. The little boy heard the doorbell ring, so he hurried to open the door  and there stood Grandma's minister. The minister said, ""Hello son, is  your Grandma home?""  The little boy replied, ""Yeah, she's in the bedroom bangin' her  boyfriend.""  The minister fainted."
