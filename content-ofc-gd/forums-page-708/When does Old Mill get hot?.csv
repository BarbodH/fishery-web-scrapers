448153,Mykester,2010-03-25 22:37:00,241," Hey, thanks for your reply. I live near the Eglinton bridge and the best I have ever caught were creek chubs. I don't know how many fish actually get passed the dam, so the best fishing is by Old Mill (in my experience). In the summer the water levels are very very low and you can't really fish the Scarlett part until after rain. Right now there is a fish sanctuary from north of the Eglinton Bridge until the 2nd week of April if I'm not mistaken. Anything south is open all year."
448179,JPD,2010-03-25 23:13:00,296,From 25 meters South of the old Mill dam all the way North is a Sanctuary until the last Sat. in April if I'm not mistaken. You can only fish South of the dam for now.
448186,Syn,2010-03-25 23:27:00,519, I Did see a salmon/steelhead last spring when I was looking from the bridge.   Looking north from the bridge last summer. http://imgur.com/1ikMu.jpg
448194,Mykester,2010-03-25 23:35:00,241," Actually the regs say fishing sanctuary from north of highway 407  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001335.pdf   Did you notice the shack with a random fence surrounding nothing? Someone's growing a garden there, it's some spooky gypsy village."
448200,MJL,2010-03-25 23:44:00,2427, Take care when reading through the regulations.  Read them thoroughly.  The year round section for the Humber is: - Eglinton Ave down to Lake Ontario  The extended season stretch for the Humber  allows anglers to fish between the 407 down to the Lake between the last Saturday in April to December 31  Anything north of the 407 is open between the last Saturday in April and Sept 30 (General trout season)  You are not allowed to fish 25 downstream of any dam or weir on the Humber at any time.  There's about 5-6 of them in the lower Humber below Eglinton Ave  I recommend that everyone read the regs themselves and re-read them again.   I'd never rely solely on someone else's ability to interpret them for me.
448204,Mykester,2010-03-25 23:48:00,241, It's common knowledge that you can't fish within 25 m of a dam.
448210,JPD,2010-03-25 23:52:00,296,Wow... there's a change... I haven't fished there in 15 or more years but never knew that one... it's a bit misleading with the exception also saying Fall Extended season until Dec 31st. from Eglington to 407... does that mean it closes on Jan 1st? Also an exception from upstream of the 407... no fishing from Oct 1st to 4th Sat in April... why can't they define things a little better?
448214,Syn,2010-03-25 23:56:00,519, There's 2 fenced off areas with huts now. The older one closer to the river is used by an oriental couple. They grow bean type things (fava beans???). Then in late summer I see them lay them out on a large tarp and dry them. The new area is used by what I think is two eastern European guys. I think this will be their first season of planting. Don't know if they are there illegally or renting from Crown.
448216,MJL,2010-03-26 00:00:00,2427, I was referring more to your statement to JP about anything north of the 407 being a Sanctuary.  It could mislead others to think that this is the case right now...It isn't...Anything north of Eglinton is a Sanctuary till the Last Saturday of April.  If you're new to fishing the Humber you'll be surprised how many people don't realize that fishing 25m below a dam is illegal throughout the year...Or they just plain ignore the fact.
448220,Mykester,2010-03-26 00:04:00,241," Well I guess my first comment was right about north of Eglinton being a sanctuary, the regs actually got me confused (JP stated that north of Old Mill was a sanctuary).  I've also seen plenty of people a few years back standing right beside the dam at Etienne Brule fishing. Does Toronto not have any Conservation Officers?"
448943,toca,2010-03-28 00:07:00,274,Hmm Wanted To Do Some Carp Fishing South of Old Mill. Wouldnt Mind The Rivers Too.
446039,Mykester,2010-03-21 22:53:00,241,I've passed by on the subway a couple times this week and haven't seen any fishermen yet.
446042,Terry,2010-03-21 22:57:00,14456,not a lot of info there  I take it old Mill isn't a woman named Milly   and I don't know when she gets hot????
446045,danbouck,2010-03-21 23:06:00,4380,Old Mill in Ancaster usually has some hot scenery in the next few months.
446047,Roy,2010-03-21 23:07:00,13728,My Old Mil is room temperature....only about 20 left.
446049,Syn,2010-03-21 23:09:00,519,The Humber is still pretty muddy and the water is high. Did not see anyone fishing at Etienne Brul√© Park last week when the weather was warm.
446062,MJL,2010-03-21 23:38:00,2427,"If you're referring to steelhead, most years The Humber on average is rarely fishable till about mid-April (at least by my standards).  This year may be different with less snow melt.  I haven't fished there yet this year to take a look.  It tends to blow out for weeks after ice out and spring rains definitely don't help.  Usually runs a chocolaty brown colour.  The majority of the steelhead blow right through the lower sections really fast when the water's high - You'll see them jumping.  I spent tons of time there in between classes and after class watching them jump the first dam.  You get dropbacks later in spring but I normally get 1 for every 30-50 suckers I catch - Them suckers are aggressive.LOL"
446128,danjang,2010-03-22 01:12:00,148,When I was a kid I caught 4 suckers using a net in one go. That place is full of em. Suckers are already up some of the tribs in force
446172,Mykester,2010-03-22 02:51:00,241,Anyone eat the suckers from there? My dad is coming back from the hospital tomorrow and loves them.
446188,StoneFly,2010-03-22 03:28:00,574,"Mykester,...LMAO......love the Avatar pic....where did you get that?"
446194,Syn,2010-03-22 03:48:00,519,   I think eating a humber river sucker will put him right back in the hospital. Half joking 3 eyed suckers in the humber.  I'd check the 2009 - 2010 Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish http://www.ene.gov.o...guide/index.php  just to double check mercury and pcb level of those fish.
446494,Mykester,2010-03-22 20:10:00,241,"I'll pm you the link, some of the content is nsfw.   Don't they come up from the depths of Lake O to spawn? Not sure if a fish that's been present for a short while in the river would be harmful, but I'm not a fish scientist so I will look into it (or just go to the credit instead).  EDIT: Eating guide says 4 meals, how many suckers is a meal?"
446640,Rizzo,2010-03-23 00:15:00,4754, if you can stomach one of them good for you
446815,fishing,2010-03-23 03:08:00,167, Half a pound is one meal. An average meal size - 227 grams (eight ounces).  See page 3.      Good luck. http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/publications/590b14.pdf
446823,fishing,2010-03-23 03:13:00,167,Sucker should start to bite hard in a week or two. Have fun.
446890,dsn,2010-03-23 12:26:00,1018,You looking for fishermen or for fish?
446900,bushart,2010-03-23 12:44:00,2628,"I would not eat those suckers  Many times years back I caught them with tumours galore from Lake O tribs  I know guys that eat suckers from up north that run out of the lakes---but these are not the same  Buy your dad a chunk of fresh salmom---be healthier------10,000 grizzly bears can't be wrong  Bushart"
446904,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-23 13:04:00,2050,"My buddies and I tried spring run suckers from the Thames River in Downtown London during college! haha They tasted fine, but the meat was mushy and it was near impossible to get all the bones out.  I'm sure if you follow the the guide you're dad will be a-ok with eating them.  But yeah, the Credit River is just down the road, and is easy pickings for the spring run suckers as well!  Good luck!

447012,Carp,2010-03-23 17:29:00,1488,"""When does the old mill get hot ?""  When da old fe-mill is ready, she make him hot.   I haven't fished the Old Mill in years. The fall was always good for salmon and brown trout. Some rainbow trout coming up in the spring, but I only caught a few. I would imagine there are some in there right now.  Be aware of the no fishing zone (sanctuary) below the first dam (north of Old Mill bridge). I think it extends 25 metres below the dam.      "
447078,aniceguy,2010-03-23 19:06:00,1094, well I was there looking for a few of those pesky suckers... for another mission ( not a fish fry if your thinkin )  nadda to be found yet waters too cold...
447261,Rizzo,2010-03-23 23:15:00,4754, were you gonna chuck 'em at teenagers...you know the ones with the pants? There's nothing more insulting than being smacked with a coarse fish.
447324,aniceguy,2010-03-24 00:33:00,1094,  lol unless your a pussy cat
447906,JoshS,2010-03-25 03:14:00,729,I was fishing humber bay a couple days ago and noticed a lot of fish breaking the surface at dusk.  I think they were suckers.
448144,Burt,2010-03-25 22:10:00,1,"Just walked the Humber today from Old Mill up to Scarlet road doing some scouting and saw six guys fishing, all clustered around the Old Mill bridge. One of the guys had 2 fish on a stringer but he was doing his best not to show the fish off so couldn't tell anything about them. Looked on the small side. The water was still pretty murky though.  Just moved to Toronto recently and was wondering, once the fishing starts to warm up, will I be able to find fish along any stretch of the Humber (from Old Mill to Eglinton) or is my only chance to get a bite will be to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the other guys all fishing the same small stretch of the river?"
