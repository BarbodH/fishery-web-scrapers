449050,blue pickeral,2010-03-28 09:38:00,267,"Have recently purchased an HDS 5 sonar unit for which I am attaching the transducer to the transom of an aluminum hull Lund SSV16 boat. As we anticipate renting some dock space for the summer months, need good quality material that resists UV, oil, gas, etc. The Star Board is pricey, but apparently the best for the job.  Plan to bolt piece to transom above water line on bolt, with added 3M 5200 adhesive on transom section below/at water line.  There is a marine place in Kingston I can order it from, but was wondering if anyone knew an outlet closer to east GTA where I cnould actually get my hands on the material to judge proper thickness?  Any ideas, tips, or similar experiences shared would be appreciated!"
449126,sirfish,2010-03-28 15:57:00,175,  Starboard can be bought at West Marine but it is pricey....but here is a tip that will save you $$$. Just go to your local Dollar store or any store that sells kitchen gadgets and buy a white cutting board. Same stuff last forever . Just trim it off to the size you want and Bobs your uncle.
