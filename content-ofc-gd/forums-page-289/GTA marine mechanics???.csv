I previously dealt with Buckeye marine, mainly because the motor was serviced there from day one. Then my motor started acting up and they quoted me ballpark of $4k to rebuild a 1999 merc 90hp. Went to get a second opinion and it turned out that the motor was serviced incorrectly and had it repaired for $500. That mechanic has moved away since, and im left with nobody to help. Couple weeks ago my starter got jammed in the up position, and motor stalled. I soaked the starter gear shaft and it seems to be working fine now. However, the gears dont catch the flywheel now. I was amazed when i looked up the parts to find out the flywheel sells for almost $600 and starter around $500. With labour im probably more likely to pay around $2k seems pretty crazy to me... Any input? Also i live in oshawa and head north to kawarthas at least couple times a week. Would be a bonus to find somebody along the way. Thanx guys!!"

801904,Angler management,2013-08-06 16:38:00,280,"Teeth are not broken, but a few of them are worn down. Im wondering if it could just be the gear on the starter that needs replacing..."
