800201,fishing n autograph,2013-07-26 12:43:00,2540,In this day and age ball players are so babied that they aren't tough nor are they durable. 30 years ago pitchers threw 150 pitches a game not 100... The league leader in complete games each year ends up with less than 10. In the greatest generation try had 20-30
800319,jedimaster,2013-07-27 04:12:00,3472,Thought I would take the name of this thread and the song of course for our sign. If you are watching Saturdays game look for us in right field second deck.  â€‹

800371,jedimaster,2013-07-27 18:05:00,3472,That was a pretty rough start. Kids are half asleep already. Haha

800866,Dave Bailey,2013-07-30 03:25:00,1641,"And once the worst team in MLB leaves town, we go back to losing. If this team wins 70 games it will be a miracle. Doubt I'll watch another game this year, just not worth the aggravation."
800871,Hooked,2013-07-30 03:43:00,891,"Chemistry is important, perhaps they don't have any?  But I think a Joe Torre would fit nicely with this team and make it happen."
802038,Dave Bailey,2013-08-07 04:13:00,1641,Josh Johnson goes 5 innings of shutout ball? Did anyone notice in which direction the Sun set tonight?
802075,fishing n autograph,2013-08-07 14:07:00,2540,I think it has to do with the catcher
802076,fishing n autograph,2013-08-07 14:09:00,2540,"Joe torre isn't a good manager he just had a team of hall of famers.  He was fired 4 times and had losing records in Atlanta, St Louis and Texas"
802096,davey buoy,2013-08-07 18:52:00,5505,"IMO the catcher,among others have not been able to work together on a daily basis.More chemistry is what we need."
802169,davey buoy,2013-08-07 23:17:00,5505,We had this game and let it get away AGAIN!  .

799632,Dave Bailey,2013-07-23 03:12:00,1641,"They've given up, and so have I. Probably won't bother watching another game this season."
799691,jedimaster,2013-07-23 14:11:00,3472,Told you... Jays still suck.
799703,Mike Pike,2013-07-23 15:38:00,1332,No they don't.  Just listen to any Rogers Media property.
799737,davey buoy,2013-07-23 19:37:00,5505,"I had decent expectations this year,maybe give it a good run at least. I also think they have given up.Looks like a few guys may be on the chopping block come trade deadline.Whatever they were suppose to have is not working very well."
799744,jimmer,2013-07-23 19:50:00,2730,It's a head scratcher! They look so baaaaaad!
799997,jedimaster,2013-07-25 01:03:00,3472,"The kids want to go see a game so I will be taking them to the Saturday game. Middle deck nearest center field second row. Will be wearing a leafs jersey holding a sign ""am I too early for training camp?"""
800008,Dave Bailey,2013-07-25 02:02:00,1641, When they're down by a bunch of runs try to yell AAAAAAARRRRRGGGOOOOOOOOOS!!!
800009,jedimaster,2013-07-25 02:07:00,3472,"Maybe a sign that says. ""Sens Suck. Go leafs go!"" I am open to suggestions."
800015,Dan668,2013-07-25 02:53:00,1120,Trade 'em all. Pathetic
800096,jimmer,2013-07-25 16:36:00,2730,Another crapper last night. Is it the manager???? or the players??? Can't believe the bullpen lost all of their arms at the same time.
800099,Mike Pike,2013-07-25 17:23:00,1332,"With the starters always getting shelled early, they've had to ride the pullpen pretty hard.  Me thinks they're starting to show the wear now."
800153,davey buoy,2013-07-25 22:42:00,5505,"I find myself still watching,for what reason?,not sure.Houston is in town,worst team in the whole league.Wonder in which inning the jays will blow it?  . We'll find out soon enough.lol.A lot of good that players only meeting did.Maybe todays the start of something better  .."
800168,Dave Bailey,2013-07-26 00:56:00,1641,"At the end of the season, maybe even before, I would fire all the training staff. I doubt that this bunch could keep the bat-boy healthy."

783760,jimmer,2013-05-01 15:20:00,2730,Nice to see them stick with it and have someone hit with runners in scoring position when they were down.
783774,davey buoy,2013-05-01 18:22:00,5505,"I agree,but that has been there downfall so far."
783802,jimmer,2013-05-01 20:13:00,2730,"Agreed, that's why it was nice to see, Now they have to keep it going."

784393,davey buoy,2013-05-04 22:31:00,5505,"Say what you want,unlike the leafs,the Jays are consistant!!  lol."
784396,Dave Bailey,2013-05-04 22:46:00,1641,"Unless they make some changes, and fast, they will win no more than 70 games, possibly no more than 60. They are, in a word, pathetic, and embarrassing to watch.  Fans have no right to expect a team to win every game, and no right to expect a winning season every year. But we have every right to expect them to go out and at least play like winners. They aren't even coming close to that.  I've heard that the guys aren't getting down on themselves, and the clubhouse is upbeat. That may be part of the problem. They have no reason to feel upbeat, they should be feeling like crap, mad as hell with themselves, and willing to get mad at each other. They have no excuse at all for any rosy ""Oh, everything will be okay, we just have to go on a winning streak"" attitude. They also need to be on the receiving end of a lot of boos and chants of AAAAAAARRRRGOOOOOOOSSSS! The time for fan patience is over, as their season probably is."
784494,davey buoy,2013-05-05 19:21:00,5505,"I think they may of heard you Dave, their hitting today,10-2 top of the eigth,can they hold on though?"
784603,Dave Bailey,2013-05-06 04:57:00,1641," If they turn it around now, I take full credit."
784848,davey buoy,2013-05-07 07:56:00,5505,"There on a two game win streak  ,keep it up!"
784870,Dave Bailey,2013-05-07 12:42:00,1641,Hope my cheque is in the mail.

785057,fishing n autograph,2013-05-08 00:48:00,2540,Looks bad but he left talking and waved to the crowd
785068,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 01:03:00,3525,It's encouraging but any number of things could happen. Hopefully we'll hear some reassuring news soon...
785229,davey buoy,2013-05-08 18:51:00,5505,Haven't heard anything yet as my cable is in and out. Let's hope the boys win #4 in a row for him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

785910,davey buoy,2013-05-11 20:42:00,5505,"I'm now wondering if Gibbons is thinking he's dreaming,this can't be happening. Bottom of the eighth and Boston has tied. All was going well. Nothing new of course,BUT.  ."
785915,ketchenany,2013-05-11 21:17:00,3229,"How can he be dreaming, slumped over a fence chewing tobacco and spitting. The last time he was here it was the same. Cito was a guy players played for. I 'coach' people where I work, very friendly And offer advice, I don't sit and watch.  maybe some of them don't like working with him, he has been around the block a few times."
785917,davey buoy,2013-05-11 21:28:00,5505,"I do remember him saying a while ago something like""these guys know what they have to do,it's their reputation""along those lines.These guys should be able to win without a manager with there talent just sayin. There is a crap load of money spent on this team. You think we should get rid of the manager ?I'm thinking that's way to easy. The players need to step way,way,up!"
785921,ketchenany,2013-05-11 22:01:00,3229,"I don't usually get into this stuff but, when I go to work and have been for the last 40+ years, I expect my people to do their best. In my early years I've had to work for managers who knew less than me. Now the people I teach are treated with respect and if they do make a mistake it's pointed out as it costs us money to fix. In baseball the season comes to an end and everybody goes home. They all get paid. Just saying he may not be the best person to work for IMOP."
785925,davey buoy,2013-05-11 22:19:00,5505,"I do agree,but paying good money,get's you better employees,in"" most"" cases. We all worked for someone who new less than we did at one time.This is professional,Paid way more than your average Joe. The manager and players are not new to the game. We'll have to see how it goes?,they were able to win this one."
785926,ketchenany,2013-05-11 22:46:00,3229,"I probably make less than my manager, who does not not know what I do (I'm a trade person/ she is called a production manager who does not know how a project is produced. How can people be hired to manage people who they don't know about? I teach on the job to pass on my craft and have for the last 35+ years. Gibbons sits, chews tobacco and spits, on occasion he goes out to the mound. That is called ""look I'm working and you have to pay me. Win or lose.! For many years  at this time I'd be sitting on Pigion Lake looking for walleye, times change we get older.  Any true typographers put there? There are only so many left to pass on our skills."
786013,fishing n autograph,2013-05-12 14:58:00,2540,too much faith in the manager. The manager in professional baseball is almost meaningless lol
786064,davey buoy,2013-05-12 19:36:00,5505,"A better game so far today for the Jays! 10 runs on 10 hits!!,haven't been able to say that for a while."

782049,jedimaster,2013-04-24 21:34:00,3472,"Jays won in the 11th Gibbons got ejected in the 8th or ninth.  Couldn't find it on tv, had to listen on the radio. SO old school."
782051,fishing n autograph,2013-04-24 21:42:00,2540,Did he get tossed for arguing balls and strikes?
782076,jedimaster,2013-04-24 22:36:00,3472,"Not sure, I missed it, I know it came shortly after they blew the lead. I was hunting for the game on TV, when I gave up and turned the radio on he was gone.  This is from TSN's write up"
782078,jedimaster,2013-04-24 22:38:00,3472,"I gotta admit, I have jumped thebandwagon a bit, I have watched a few games this season. I love the idea of a hot shot knuckle baller on the mound. Too bad he got smoked both games I watched him pitch."
782079,davey buoy,2013-04-24 22:42:00,5505,"I hear he's finding himself now. Watched him pitch last week,when he's on he's a pleasure to watch.The batting is brutal!!."

782805,fishing n autograph,2013-04-28 08:38:00,2540,Very frustrating
782889,Dave Bailey,2013-04-28 15:56:00,1641,"Looks to me as if they bought into all the hype, and think they're the reincarnation of the '27 Yankees. They've got a great bunch of individuals, but instead of going out and making it all come together by playing as a team, they're waiting for it to all come together by itself. Ain't gonna happen.  Wondering if Gibby is about to go on a Lee Elia style rant. For those unfamiliar, here's a link, definitely not safe for work:"
782915,fishing n autograph,2013-04-28 20:21:00,2540,Lol I would pay money to see that....

780828,fishing n autograph,2013-04-19 20:33:00,2540,Dickie said the way he was pitching last night he could have thrown a complete game if his back hadn't stiffened up

781916,Headhunter,2013-04-24 13:04:00,5703,"I've watched a number of games this year and find the performance of the team to be lacking. They seem to have started the year with the belief that they have already won the division, based on the hype surrounding the team. Gibbons' hands off approach has not helped as IMHO they seem to lack focus as a team. With Reyes out and an obvious lack of a 2nd baseman, they are weak up the middle. They don't seem to have any idea about how they are going to approach their at bats, just hoping for a pitch to hit rather then having a game plan. I really hope that they get their collective poop in a bag soon, or this will be yet another lost season. Gibbons should pull a ""major league"" on these guys and start tossing bats around the club house... so far, being the nice guy hasn't yielded any posititve results! HH"
781996,jedimaster,2013-04-24 18:52:00,3472,Hey don't they televise all of the games? I am off work for the next week and the game Is on but I can't find it on tv.
781998,davey buoy,2013-04-24 18:57:00,5505,I'm home now and can't find it.Somebody help!

779637,FloatnFly,2013-04-14 13:21:00,1640,"Reyes out up to 3 months!  Dickies outting vs the Red Sox was bad due to a broken finger nail, which you need to be able to throw a knuckler effectively.  they're only a game below 500 ball, no its not the 23-7 aprils we're used to, but its not bad.  glad to see they have a gold glove shortstop in kawasaki as a back up to reyes"
779667,fishing n autograph,2013-04-14 16:53:00,2540,Dickie was pulled because he had 2 men on in the seventh. Gibbons is a very good manager. All of the analysts that I read have said he is incredible in bullpen management and controlling his pitching staff. Dickie is a competitor. Plain ad simple and he didn't want to be taken out. Not starter does
779668,fishing n autograph,2013-04-14 16:55:00,2540,Kawasaki needs to find the form he had prior to coming to the MLB from Japan. Ichiro calls him his little brother lol.... Kawasaki has tried to copy Ichiro's style
779750,Tony68,2013-04-15 01:13:00,31,So much for Gibbon's incredible bullpen management. Putting in Oliver the next Cordero. Dickie  could of easily finished that game and should have.
779797,fishing n autograph,2013-04-15 04:58:00,2540,So it's the Gibbons' fault that Oliver threw a couple of bad pitches? There was no one left in the pen. Loop threw 3 innings the day before and Janssen pitched 2 days in a row.  You can win if you don't score...  And if Dickie was left in there the jays would be 3-7... Dickie's mechanics were off and he was falling too far off the mound changing his arm slot. He was tipping his pitches
779813,FloatnFly,2013-04-15 12:37:00,1640," this early in the season pitchers are on pretty strict pitch counts to save arms/shoulders, dickie was at 100 pitches when he got pulled, with another possible 30-50 pitches left to go, not worth it"
779854,fishing n autograph,2013-04-15 14:53:00,2540,And with his knuckleball that could really be a ton of pitches if its not floating well
779961,Hooked,2013-04-15 21:16:00,891,"My concern is Dickey's knuckle-ball may lack the movement in the Dome?  Dome open we'll have to see.   But his stats at Roger's Center, prior to joining Jays, is not that good:  28 hits in 22 innings of work equals not good. Still gonna root for him and the Jays though.  Hopefully they can work these kinks out soon."
779962,davey buoy,2013-04-15 21:17:00,5505,I'm hoping  .
780000,fishing n autograph,2013-04-15 23:36:00,2540,Remember when dickey pitched in the dome he wasn't the same pitcher. It will change. I'm more concerned with buerhle
780400,davey buoy,2013-04-17 20:25:00,5505,"Well J A Happ tonight,let's hope they can get it going! Go Jays Go!"
780424,fishing n autograph,2013-04-17 22:09:00,2540,Yesterday was a great game. JJ looks like he's got it together. Lets get the bats going
780425,davey buoy,2013-04-17 22:13:00,5505,"Agreed,the hitting has been slow so far."
780427,fishing n autograph,2013-04-17 22:21:00,2540,Yup and I had to question Colby Rasmus being pinch hit for
780476,knightfisher,2013-04-18 01:43:00,237,"3 games below .500 not impressed. May be the new guys need some time to settle in, If that's not the problem, then there's a problem."
780540,jimmer,2013-04-18 14:06:00,2730,Have they started yet?
780559,BucktownAngler,2013-04-18 15:26:00,582,"you guys do realize Reyes is out, Bautista is out, Lawrie has been out"
780566,Tony68,2013-04-18 16:06:00,31,"Yeah Gibbons is an idot,he didn't work the first time he's not going to work the second time either."
780570,fishing n autograph,2013-04-18 16:39:00,2540,Wow lets pack everything in...there's only 150 games left
780581,davey buoy,2013-04-18 17:48:00,5505,"There's still a lot of time guys,there only 4 games behind with a terrible start. Things can't get any worse!!!! I hope.Let's hope they get a win tonight!"
780582,Tony68,2013-04-18 17:50:00,31,"Yup let's dig that hole early too, this way the fan turn out we be just as poor ,and all this money we spent on these players was a waste,won't be able to afford them because of the fan turn out and we will be looking at another 20 years before we compete again.Go Gibbon's go. I really hope I'm wrong thou."
780585,davey buoy,2013-04-18 17:56:00,5505,"Thank god it's not a 48 game season. lol.,The chemistry still has to build even after spring training. Individually,these fellows have way to much pride to lose.I think you'll see a change soon."
780730,davey buoy,2013-04-19 11:01:00,5505,"Lucky to get a way with that one!!Dickie was great,The bats,not so much. Yankees in town tonight."
780818,Tony68,2013-04-19 19:52:00,31,I'm going to  the game tonight.
777790,Christopheraaron,2013-04-05 22:35:00,3525, The rock do lol
777981,davey buoy,2013-04-06 19:48:00,5505,"Anyone see John Lackey throw his arm out against the Jays?.It was painfull to watch,it was his first game back after Tommy John surgery...You hate to see these type of injuries come back again when your suppose to be good to go."
778127,JamesG,2013-04-07 18:40:00,32,Todays game is not going as well....  hopefully the homeruns will start soon...
778129,davey buoy,2013-04-07 18:47:00,5505,This has been R A's second rough start. At least they pulled him. Sooner would of been better today.
778171,Bassaholic,2013-04-07 22:33:00,74,"Was at the game today...Jays played like a bad AAA team. Dickey and Bush seemed to think they were throwing BP for Boston, so many taters down the middle, it was a joke!"
778242,fishing n autograph,2013-04-08 10:08:00,2540,"Not a big deal... Almost every ace got shellacked yesterday.... Price gave up 8, dickey gave up 8, Cain gave up 9, Strasbourg 6, Hamels 7 and verlander gave up 7"
778246,Tayzak15,2013-04-08 11:13:00,318, Don't forget to add CC Sabbathia pitched 7 scoreless innings and hes an ACE
778280,fishing n autograph,2013-04-08 15:56:00,2540,He's also 1-1 there's 156 games left in the season lol.
778282,Hooked,2013-04-08 15:56:00,891, Exactly what i was thinking!
778304,jimmer,2013-04-08 19:01:00,2730,Let them start soon! LOL
778831,davey buoy,2013-04-10 19:02:00,5505,"Rain delay?,at least snow so far is not in there forcast I think.? 3:30 start weather permitting"
778879,davey buoy,2013-04-10 23:15:00,5505,Nice come back from a 6-1 deficit. Won 8-6 WTG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
778886,Tony68,2013-04-10 23:59:00,31,"We needed that, nice comeback. hopefully there hitting starts to get hot, then look out !"
779032,davey buoy,2013-04-11 18:31:00,5505,"6-1 for Detroit again in the 4th,Ithink this must be a repeat of yesterday. lol. I hope so!!!!"
779121,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-12 00:18:00,4399,Rumour had it that the jays were going to have a great pitching staff this year great defence awesome speed so wake me up when it shows up.
779146,Tony68,2013-04-12 02:04:00,31,Man what the hell is going on. I wonder if there is something going on in the club house. This is just bad.
779205,fishing n autograph,2013-04-12 11:49:00,2540,I don't think the Dominican boys on the team like the -3 weather and rain lol
779417,davey buoy,2013-04-13 09:57:00,5505,"Hard hit to the Jays yesterday,Jose Reyes out for a month anyways.Twisted his ankle while sliding into base. Not broken they say but a bad sprain at least."
779431,fishing n autograph,2013-04-13 12:24:00,2540,"Yup, I had the same thing... Only out I action for 2 weeks. All depends he gets top of the line care so he may not be gone that long"
779436,Tony68,2013-04-13 12:52:00,31,This is not good
779455,davey buoy,2013-04-13 14:04:00,5505,"If what FishnNAutographs says ,that's not so bad!"
779490,Tayzak15,2013-04-13 18:20:00,318,"Still early in the season, if you're going to have injuries now is the time to have them. Seasons pretty much meaningless until June anyways."

779567,captpierre,2013-04-14 00:45:00,2521,Glad to see Dickie's got his stuff tonight
779569,davey buoy,2013-04-14 00:49:00,5505,Figured he had to show up some time. Be nice to see if he can pick up a win!!
777188,davey buoy,2013-04-02 18:59:00,5505,Can't wait till opener tonight. Hope the boys do all right.! RA Dickie to start.Giver guys!!

777242,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-02 21:00:00,10439,But hockey is still going on.......................GO LEAFS GO!!!!!!
777247,davey buoy,2013-04-02 21:07:00,5505,I can multi task! lol. This is the first time in a long while one more Toronto team could cause a little bit of excitement around here!
777255,BucktownAngler,2013-04-02 21:33:00,582,"i know the stadium will be full tonight, as ive had a hard enough time getting tickets myself. i have to try my luck with a scammer scalper.   i just hope the city supports the team, and the skydome isnt empty for the rest of the year.  GO JAYS GO!  GO LEAFS GO!"
777261,Marko,2013-04-02 21:41:00,854,i hope the knuckleball is dancing tonight
777267,snoil,2013-04-02 21:56:00,139,let us know how much you paid heard $2000+ per ticket in section 115!!! much rather stay home no line ups for washroom beer or food! sure they will have 35000+ plus for the next while anyways
777269,FloatnFly,2013-04-02 22:17:00,1640,"they stay healthy and don't lose 3 starting pitchers in one week, they'll have a great year"
777272,phatpelkey,2013-04-02 22:39:00,78,"ive been a life time jays fan, so im super pumped!! 1 thing I hate is now the people who really don't give a crap about the jays are going because of the hype!!, I loved going to a game not sardined together in the stadium, I guess its the price you pay for a great team"
777277,Christopheraaron,2013-04-02 23:01:00,3525,GO JAYS GO!!!  Can't wait to watch knuckle ball after knuckle ball
777280,nancur373,2013-04-02 23:10:00,1211,Let's Go Birds!!!
777287,grizzlybri,2013-04-02 23:36:00,565,"The Dome looks packed, Let's go Blue Jays"
777294,jedimaster,2013-04-03 00:15:00,3472,That knuckle ball has some serious movement. Lots of pass balls this season I bet. I wouldn't rush out to go see them though. There will be lots of tickets in a couple days for every other game of the season.
777302,Jigger,2013-04-03 00:57:00,1237,Havent really been a bball fan for a few years but have been getting kindof pumped! Go Jays Go!!
777304,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-03 01:03:00,10439,I was a huge fan and was even @ the dome when they won their first world series but after the second strike I had enough of the Bull and haven't watched a game since.
777310,jedimaster,2013-04-03 01:21:00,3472,"Drifter same for me. That second strike killed it and I swore I wouldn't watch again until the jays field a contender. If they play well I'll be back otherwise, I will pass. So far they don't look too great. I predict they will lose every game this year."
777323,FloatnFly,2013-04-03 03:21:00,1640,"thought it was 3 strikes and out....not 2, hockey has had more strikes and no one stops watching"
777327,Tayzak15,2013-04-03 05:31:00,318,"This game went nearly how I expected it. The players were too pumped up and lacked execution a ""NEW"" team always lacks. Biggest difference was the double plays the jays hit into and the passed balls that Arencibia gave up.  Always gave up the passed ball after a Dickey walk which would let the runner advance easily. so on groundballs afterward it would let the runner advance to third rather than Clevland hitting into double plays as well. Clevland got 2 runs because of that tonight."
777401,davey buoy,2013-04-03 19:13:00,5505,"After last nights game,I wouldn't panic to much.There is still 161 games left lol. RA's pitches are something to watch,the catcher needs even a bigger glove!!"
777725,davey buoy,2013-04-05 15:43:00,5505,"Well they got a win,What's that saying 1 out of 3 ain't bad lol."
777755,fishing n autograph,2013-04-05 20:35:00,2540,159 games left... Dominicans don't play we'll in the cold lol
777757,jedimaster,2013-04-05 20:37:00,3472,Good thing they aren't playing at the Ex anymore.  
777764,Fishaholic,2013-04-05 20:44:00,22,"I'm not worried in the least, let's see how we look 20-25 games from now!!Can you imagine if both the Jays and the Leafs both made the playoffs??? My mind would be blown!! Toronto teams don't make the playoffs!"
