801942,NAW,2013-08-06 19:19:00,4022,"With a little help from Dad!  Off the dock at the family cottage last weekend.  My wife came over the snap a few pics of us fishing.  And just so happened to catch Alex's first fist on camera.  Hook set and all!  Alex's favorite part about fishing is chewing on the rod handle.   We (I) felt some taps, so I pulled rod out of his mouth, and set the hook!  He was pretty interested in this little sun fish!   "
