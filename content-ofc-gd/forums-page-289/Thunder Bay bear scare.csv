801849,wormdunker,2013-08-06 11:37:00,1711,Wow!  That's 2 cases I've heard recently where the bear was agressive.  Usually they shy away from people.
801865,ketchenany,2013-08-06 13:20:00,3229,The dog did not survive. The bear was shot.
801866,lew,2013-08-06 13:34:00,12766,"Sad to hear about the dog dying, guess he was loyal right to the end."
801867,porkpie,2013-08-06 13:45:00,2521,At least they shot the bear so be wont have an opportunity to chew on someone else!  Shame about the dog!
