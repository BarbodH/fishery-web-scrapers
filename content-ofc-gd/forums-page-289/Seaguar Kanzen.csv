801885,FloatnFly,2013-08-06 15:30:00,1640,"I've recently started using a bait caster, and mono and fluoro just have too much memory on those reels,  anyone use seaguar kanzen braid?  http://www.sail.ca/en/catalogue/fishing/fishing-lines/1854/kanzen/"
801907,Angler management,2013-08-06 16:43:00,280,"I would just go with the trusty original moss green power pro. I have tried pretty much every other one and i always say to myself ""what a waste of $"" never did try the seaguar tho! Lol"
801917,solopaddler,2013-08-06 17:18:00,8605,"Kanzen is by far the worst braid I've ever used. Breaks like crazy, terrible stuff.  Give Power Pro a shot."
801919,Sinker,2013-08-06 17:21:00,8692,"Yep, stick with power pro and you won't have any issues."
801922,musky_hunter,2013-08-06 17:43:00,328,like sunline sx1 and fx2 allot...best braid i've used in the past few years.
801966,FrankTheRabbit,2013-08-06 21:31:00,479,"Sufix 832 ain't bad and can be had on sale sometimes at Canadian Tire for $14, regularly $23."
801971,davey buoy,2013-08-06 21:38:00,5505,"x3,Three bait casters,one spinning reel,all with moss green power pro.No issues here as well.8/32 seems to work well for me."
801981,croixed,2013-08-06 23:06:00,14,I agree with Mike Borger.  Could not believe how easily the stuff breaks.  Seems as if power pro and Sufix 832 are the big two.
802033,SirWhite,2013-08-07 03:01:00,210,"When you start having to deal with tip wrap you'll wish you'd had been happy with mono lol. Braid is the way and Power Pro is the name. You'll lose less lures too, due to the brute strength of the line."
802047,Rich,2013-08-07 10:16:00,3927,"Power pro is the worst braid I've ever used, and I say it everytime I spool up a reel with that stuff. Give it two fishing trips, i'll have stripped it off and put stealth on it.  The seaguar is right in the same league with PP in my books."
802049,NANUK,2013-08-07 10:32:00,797, I was thinking of trying Kanzen but I will save my money now and stick with Daiwa Samurai which I find is best casting braid for me. Not a big fan of Power Pro.
802050,wormdunker,2013-08-07 10:35:00,1711,"I love power pro.  No memory,sensitive for the light bites, & durable.  I have 20 lb on 4 different spinning reels, with an 8 lb fluoro leader 4' long."
802054,lew,2013-08-07 11:14:00,12766,I've been using Power Pro on all my reels for about a decade now and can't see any reason to switch to anything else
802057,krixxer,2013-08-07 11:58:00,274,the original power pro feels like cordage.  I use the super 8 version and find that it works best for me.
802058,FloatnFly,2013-08-07 12:17:00,1640,"hmmmm  not too encouraging on the seaguar......i have both brands, power pro on my long spinning rod, and the seaguar on my bait caster....so i guess i will see first hand how the 2 compare...."
802066,Angler management,2013-08-07 12:54:00,280,"I guess its personal preference, all i use now is PP and im not even a fan of the slick 8. Ive used it several times and it fades and deteriorates very quickly. I have a couple reels spooled with 40lb pp and theyre still great shape after 2 seasons of hard fishing in really thick stuff."
802069,Chance,2013-08-07 13:35:00,420,Whatever your choice make sure you spool it correctly. Many of the issues with braid can be corrected by just putting the line on your reel the right way.
802188,Sinker,2013-08-08 01:42:00,8692,"Really? What kind of issues are you having?? I have at leadt 6 spinning reels spooled with it from 15-40lb, one musky rod with 65, another musky rod with 80, two dipsy rods with 50lb and I can't think of a single issue I've had. That I could blame the line.  My musky, and dipsy rods have had the same line on them for what seems like forever....has to be at least 5 seasons, probably more. Still as good now as when I put it on.  Even my kids prefer it.  S."
