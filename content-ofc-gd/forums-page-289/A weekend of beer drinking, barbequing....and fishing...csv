Well I got there Friday and drank some beer, then more beer...and never made it out at all so we got serious on Saturday. Went out in the morning got a bunch of little ones. Came back and got the Barbie ready for dinner..    This was absolutely delicious. Took hours to cook but well worth it. 4 Grown men just sat around it for 5 hours drinking and just watching it cook.....then it was time to eat....sorry, doggie.    On a side note, on the drive home I need to figure out how to build a small version of a  bbq pit like that. If anyone knows where to get the parts shoot me an IM!!  Oh yeah....the bass fishing was good, too! "
