802019,i2cool2fool,2013-08-07 02:12:00,349,"Wow. I am glad you are alive to tell your story. Consult a lawyer and as already suggested, we all need to keep our own eyes open and looking 360 degrees. Sadly, we can't place any responsibility for our own safety on anyone but oneself."
802021,NAW,2013-08-07 02:21:00,4022,"That's one hell of a crappy story man.  Made me feel a little sick to my stomach reading it to be honest.  I'm glad you where all Alive and able to tell the story.  Who knows what was running through his mind.  Hopefully it was an honest mistake.  That being said, people have to pay for their mistakes.  That's life.  I hope you get compensated.  Keep us posted!"
802025,wormdunker,2013-08-07 02:38:00,1711,Wow!  This is unreal!  The charges & fines should have been much higher than what u have described.  For you to have to hit the water for safety is brutal!
802027,Freshtrax,2013-08-07 02:41:00,2215,"That's scary , I have had a few close calls but not that close hope everyone heals up good"
802035,Stoty,2013-08-07 03:06:00,2910,"That's insane!!!! What an  Absolutely get a lawer and go after him. ""poop happens""?????  Give your head a shake moron. Should have laid him out before the cop arrived and claimed it was from the accident!  Stick it to this jerk....."
802060,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-07 12:29:00,1022,Glad everything worked out. Its amazing how wreckless people are out there. I found this past weekend on Rice Lake that alot of the bass boat guys love to pass within only 100' from you.
802061,lew,2013-08-07 12:35:00,12766," We were on Chemong on Sunday and a guy in an Alumacraft flew by me not 50' away, and the worst part was he smiled & waved as if everything was good.  Some folks just have no clue."
802070,Fish Farmer,2013-08-07 13:43:00,2234,"Gezz Lew, didn't that happen to you last year also, guy rored by you or something like that. Man stories like this makes me sick, and I suppose poop happens because I have a operators card. That card thing is just a joke. And the cops are another story. I jumped all over the OPP that was checking boats at the Orillia Perch Fest, hundreds of boats fishing in the canal at the narrows and big boats and bass boats rored right through people fishing in little boats with kids and canoes. I said to the cop, those idiots roaring through the channel passed all those small boats should be charged. The cop said Those big boats and Bass boat have the right because the others shouldn't be in the canal.   I looked at the cop and blew,   my buds said Dave watch what your saying. I said to the cop, so it's ok to run over anyone that I see JAywalking or an old person that didn't make it across fast enough at the light  . The OPP left, didn't even ask to see anything, I think he thought he poked the Bear. After awhile latter the OPP boat roared right through. Where did common sense go. Man I'm glad I have a OP. card. Now I'm all worked up, wheres my nerve pills  ."
802071,fishing n autograph,2013-08-07 13:49:00,2540,I'm not sure dangerous driving applies to boats. But then again I'm going to plead ignorance and I will have to look into it.  For sure it would have been criminal negligence if you guys were worse off... Thank god you weren't though. IMHO sue him lol. I would
802073,Henricus,2013-08-07 14:00:00,118,Glad to hear everybody was ok.  I would definitely follow up with court action.  There are far too many boaters who don't have a clue.  Was out on Sunday and it was clearly the busiest day of the season so far.  While taking a few visiting cousins tubing I was doing the usual zig zagging but carefully watching my path.  There happened to be another boat doing the same.  I was in a turn with the other boat approaching and the driver was watching his tube not looking at all at where he was going and I waited and waited to see if he would turn around to see where he was going...he didn't.  I went straight to the dock and packed it in until the water cleared.
802085,fishindevil,2013-08-07 16:46:00,6254,"glad you and your passengers were ok !!!! i live on the kawarthas so i see that crap alot,another reason i dont fish them on the long weekends its a gong show on all of them....you have to have eyes in the back of your head as it is now,i hope you see a lawyer and get your stuff back....."
802087,Roy,2013-08-07 17:13:00,13728,Now I'm not a violent man but I think this poor excuse for a human being needs to be dealt a small serving of Parry Sound Severe.
802101,SirCranksalot,2013-08-07 19:26:00,3291,Take him to court---make it hurt real bad!!!(The bugger!!!)
802108,woodenboater,2013-08-07 20:03:00,2277," That's a new one for me Roy, never heard this one before. But have similar sentiments re:violence."
802111,Jigs,2013-08-07 20:08:00,136,It happens often that someone looks to be headed straight for me but they always end up veering off. I can't imagine the day someone doesn't. Glad everyone was ok. Scary story. Good reminder to keep your wits about out there at all times.
802114,davey buoy,2013-08-07 20:18:00,5505,"Don't really want to add costs to boating,but how about a air horn,whether it be electric or compressed air?.I've heard a few out on the lake,kinda sounds like a transport truck horn,That may make someone wake up/not paying attention !,and may save a lot of lives.I'll be picking up a compressed air one this week,for emergency only."
802123,woodenboater,2013-08-07 20:52:00,2277,"You're absolutely right Davey, those canned compressed air horns are very loud and attention grabbing. I have one on whatever boat I'm in at all times. Make sure they're VERY accessible however."
802124,davey buoy,2013-08-07 20:55:00,5505,"Right in the glove box,right there.!!"
802134,Roy,2013-08-07 21:13:00,13728,Don't need legislation for the horn..... just keep one near your steering.
802186,Sinker,2013-08-08 01:35:00,8692,I think I'd be letting a low flying flare go!  S.
802308,Entropy,2013-08-08 19:46:00,747,"Yep, some idiots out there.  #1  Same kind of boat almost ran over me while fishing a shole on Balsam Lake, he turned at last min.  #2 Fishing a pile (the only pile) of rocks on Scugog, casting at the rocks (outboard tilted up, and bow mount down), and a guy goes between my bow and the rocks doing at least 40 km/hr.  Would have loved to see their faces when they hit, but they did not.  #3 Guy runs me down, and forces me to stop or I would be run over, to tell me that I was going too fast after leaving the canal.  I had passed the 10km/hr marker and was in the clear.  A fully loaded 16 ft aluminum with 25 hp going too fast, heck it is all I could do to plane.  He went on to say that it was his lake, and he owned it, his passengers were telling him to cool down, and saying sorry to me.  I'd have loved to find where he docked, and pulled his plug, no regrets.  Keep your head up, stay safe."
801897,aznphil,2013-08-06 16:17:00,73,"Hi,  just want to share my experience to everyone here, while summer is in full swing and everyone is out enjoying the lake.  PLEASE be ATTENTIVE and SAFE when on the water.  Yesterday while out on a Kawartha lake 3 of us rented a 14ft boat and were fishing outside the channel, some 200m away from the channel marker.  We were stationary, motor off, standing up fishing.  At the last second my friend, who was on the bow, spotted a 18ft Bayliner speeding at 45km/h in a direct collision course to our stern, where I was.  We were jumping and waving and at the last second I realized he wasn't stopping so I jumped.  When I surfaced there was chaos as the bow of their boat breached up on to our stern, sinking our boat.  We bailed and towed the boat back and that's when I saw how their bow dented the INSIDE of our boat, and their hull which destroyed the bench where I was sitting.  We escaped with minor injuries.  If there was ever a miracle this is it."
801898,Angler management,2013-08-06 16:27:00,280,"Wow! I thought that only happened in movies! Glad u made it out of that one, how in the HECK did he not see you??? I would be beyond ticked off!"
801899,quickme,2013-08-06 16:35:00,261,what the hell!!  Good news is that you were able to post this report and we didn't have to hear about it on the news!  How can they not see you guys?
801903,Sinker,2013-08-06 16:37:00,8692,"This same thing happened to a buddy of mine a few weeks ago on rice lake.  Never leave it to anyone else but yourself to be safe. You need eyes on the back of your head some days.  I'm glad everyone is ok, and I hope the idiot in the other boat got nailed to the fullest.  S."
801906,Angler management,2013-08-06 16:41:00,280,I imagine u would have to be completely polluted to be able to pull off a stunt like that!
801908,lew,2013-08-06 16:50:00,12766,It's just plain scary how some guys operate boats with no clue of what's going on around them.  Good to hear everyone made out OK
801909,ccmtcanada,2013-08-06 16:50:00,7971,WOW!!!  Did the other boat stick around?  What was his excuse?  Glad to hear you guys were ok....assuming your buddy jumped out of the boat as well?
801910,mercman,2013-08-06 17:00:00,7054,"With all the weekend warriors out there churning up the water, i'm surprised we don't see this more often. Glad you are ok, i'd have him charged with operating a motor craft while being stoopid !!!"
801914,Sinker,2013-08-06 17:07:00,8692,I'm curious whether the driver was charged or not. What would the charge be? Careless? DUI? My buddy that got hit settled on shore. I never would have settled. These guys need to learn a lesson. They even had a cooler full of beer in the boat!!!  I will never understand how these things happen. Scares the hell out of me thinking about it. The real scary part is I was out this weekend fishing with 3 kids under 11 in my boat. Imagine if that dipstick had hit us??? I think I'd be the one in jail once I got a hold of him!!! It really makes ya think doesn't it?  S
801925,aznphil,2013-08-06 17:51:00,73,"thanks for the reply everyone.  Today I'm still shaken but far better than yesterday, which was full of shock and trauma.  I had basically 3 seconds to decide not to be in tomorrow's headline.  At least today I am able to talk about it.  Their boat had an older man (driver), his wife, their son, and the son's family of 4 w. 2 kids under 6 I would say.  Once on shore the driver admitted he didn't see us (obviously), but was not sympathetic about it.  Kinda like a ""it happens son"" attitude.  OPP charged him with careless boating ~$400, so the cost of my phone which is now underwater with the rest of my gear (fishfinder and trolling motor).  ""Never leave it to anyone else but yourself to be safe."" - best advice period."
801928,quickme,2013-08-06 17:58:00,261," That's all he got?!?!?!?!   That's nothing if you ask me.  The guy was probably trying to show off to the family.  I was on the Trent river this past weekend with LOTS of boating traffic with my family ( wife, 5 year old and 3 year old).  If this happened to me I would of been on the news.  He should have his boating operator license suspended for 5 years to teach him a lesson.   Nick"
801936,aplumma,2013-08-06 18:40:00,6896,Glad to hear you are safe and unfortunately lost some equipment. I hope you get compensated for it. I would like to urge everyone to keep an eye out for all boats especially ones over 20 ft. Once you get into boats of that size the boats that are not on a solid plane have a large blind spot when the bow is riding high. This is not an excuse for them to not know what is in front of their boats just a heads up if you can't see the drivers face pretend he can't see you and take action. I also carry an air horn on any boat and will sound at another boat that gives me any indication they don't see me.   Art
801941,aznphil,2013-08-06 19:01:00,73,"i hope i get compensated as well, but my concern is with my friend's dad who may miss work and have to see doctor/physio.  Speaking of which anyone have experience taking a boat accident related claim to court?  Or am I better off calling an attorney?"
801944,Bill Shearer,2013-08-06 19:34:00,456,"For sure start the process at least with a lawyer that deals with this area of law. They are not cheap, and even if it doesnt go to court he/she will get you far more than if you try it yourself. Remember the insurance company you will be going up against will have their lawyers to try and tie you up. Very slow process. Let the lawyers deal with it. FWIW IMO"
801948,FloatnFly,2013-08-06 19:54:00,1640,"wow.....glad you made it out safely, what did the rental company have to say?? im sure they will be pressing charges as well.  i would definitely be pressing charges beyond what the pig patrol gave him"
801950,Flippin-Jig,2013-08-06 19:58:00,29,"The Personal Injury Alliance that you hear advertised on the radio are just about the best personal injury lawyers in Ontario.  Give them a call.  They all work on contingencies.  If you/they settle, they get a percentage of the settlement and there are no other fees to pay."
801964,northernpike56,2013-08-06 21:26:00,717,"yes, scary stuff, glad to hear you're okay.  I'm also curious as to what the process is after you're in an accident, if anyone would care to tell me.  Also, did you save your fishing stuff, or will you go through insurance to get it refunded?"
801965,davey buoy,2013-08-06 21:29:00,5505,"If no boat insurance,what happens and who pays?. Glad things worked out,meaning your OK."
801967,northernpike56,2013-08-06 21:31:00,717,"Sorry, didn't see that you lost your gear and iPhone, do you have insurance to cover that, or would you be paying out of pocket?"
801988,Andy,2013-08-06 23:31:00,330,"I would consider contacting the supervisor of the investigating officer and ask why the other operator wasn't charged criminally with dangerous operation. Lives were put at risk and, at least in my mind, running into and sinking another boat that is out of the channel at a high rate of speed may cross into operation ""in a manner that is dangerous to the public"" and ""constitutes a significant departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent person."" Quotes from a Criminal Code. The supervisor may have a reasonable explanation why a Careless was laid. I know the standard for Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle is quite high, but it wouldn't hurt to ask.  Glad you are ok. Andy"
801993,chris.brock,2013-08-07 00:31:00,4053,"wow, crazy story, fishing can be a tough sport on the Kawarthas, glad you're ok"
802009,Rod Caster,2013-08-07 01:16:00,5784,"wow, that makes me angry. What a meathead that guy is. ""poop happens""? He endangered your life. Not sure how I would have reacted in that situation."
802014,redpearl99,2013-08-07 01:37:00,259,"OP, I am an attorney and I highly suggest you contact a lawyer.  What area are you located?  Were you or the other party insured?"
802016,woodenboater,2013-08-07 01:45:00,2277,"Glad everyone is ok, all things considered. Dude should be on the hook, at minimum, for your phone, gear and ALL related medical expenses etc.. It's his attitude that really grinds my gears and am also surprised he wasn't hammered harder."
802017,bassfighter,2013-08-07 02:00:00,366,"Tell the fellow that he has to pay or you will take him to court plus other expenses including your time and gas money, you will not lose on this case, ensure you have extra copy of the OP ticket, include a list of all items that was lost, plus your time and gas, make sure you bring your friend along during court appearance as witness.  I know it is a hassle, but he was negligent regardless if he has no intent of hurting someone. Being Negligent is punishable by fines in our court system. Court would like to always know that you were willing to settle out of court, but defendant did not care of taking responsibility, which gave you no choice but to go to court . He does not stand a chance.  He even endangered everyone in his boat. the more the court will support you!"
