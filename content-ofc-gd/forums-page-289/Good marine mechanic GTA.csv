802139,JoshS,2013-08-07 21:35:00,729,I might need to do a rebuild of my 75 merc 2stroke. I'm just shopping around for help. Can anyone recommend someone?  Edit to add: I've found an independent mechanic at Keele and 401 area. Name is Eugene.. has anyone used him before?

802277,fishhatemybait,2013-08-08 14:51:00,31,I have my motor in with Halton Marine right ow and they are top notch to deal with. Strong recommendation for them.  Chris
802286,JoshS,2013-08-08 16:10:00,729,"Thanks. I'll check out city marine and Halton. Had my engine cut out on me at around 5000rpms this weekend randomly but started up fine again. Did a compression test and my compression is around 95, but it's consistent across the board. Last time I did it 16 months ago was at 120 . My water pump is getting weak and scared I overheated or something, gonna replace that asap. I'm idling a little weird and engine is louder, burning more gas, oil. It's needs some attention! Basically just want someone to check it out and let me know if I'm cool to operate it."
802287,SylvanOwner,2013-08-08 16:23:00,266,I'm more than happy to throw out a thumbs up for City Marine on the Queensway.  I've dealt with them a couple times for my older merc 25 and they have been excellent.  Good luck with your engine.
802301,torco,2013-08-08 18:05:00,656,Another thumbs up for City Marine. Just an FYI to anyone they have moved off of the queensway and are now down by the Lakefront Promendade.
