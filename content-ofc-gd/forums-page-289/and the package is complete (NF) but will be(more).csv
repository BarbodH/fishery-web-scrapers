802112,Terry,2013-08-07 20:12:00,14456,"right now it shares the same battery, that will change real soon shares gas from the onboard tank, but can use it's own tank if I want  oh and What do you do when you bring home a new motor you open it up and work on it  I just installed the troll master  speed control, easy job  http://s25.photobucket.com/user/Mrbeee1954/media/DSCF4540_zps5dc825fa.jpg.html"" target=""_blank"">   "

802125,Terry,2013-08-07 20:56:00,14456, I don't know if I can have it broken in by then

802199,Skud,2013-08-08 02:19:00,739,Sweet set up Terry.      Jealous!
802200,irishfield,2013-08-08 02:26:00,26272,Come on Terry... you know it's not complete! Now you need the second battery and the charging isolator that the dealer should have put in... more trolling spoons... more track accessories.. auto pilot...  A very nice riding boat... as I can say I have had the honour !  ...btw.. did you get the gas tank with the 9.9 ? They come into the dealer with tank and they usually grab them and throw them on the store shelf after hooking your motor up to the boat tank.
802202,fishnsled,2013-08-08 02:36:00,3520,"Looking good Terry!  Not you, the boat."
802241,Terry,2013-08-08 08:59:00,14456,thanks all        yeah I am sure I will never be through buy stuff for it  and no tank came with it it was great getting out washing lures with you
802242,Roy,2013-08-08 09:33:00,13728, If you want to catch fish you need to take me out there. Taking Wayne fishing is akin to having a bunch of bananas in your livewell.
