Was thinking about going up there in about a month or so, and would to get a map, as I am not familiar with the lake.  Private message me if you have too, Thanks!  Frank"

797488,bare foot wader,2013-07-10 19:45:00,1354,"you could check the navionics website, there is a search function to search by lake...if they do have a map, the iphone/smartphone app is only $15, not amazing contours/detail but will give you a decent idea about the lake"
797549,Frank,2013-07-10 23:44:00,74,"I've been trying google for a couple days but keep getting pay websites and they all seem to be topo maps as far as I can tell, and angler atlas has the same thing, yet they are free, which is great, but not what I was looking for. As for Navionics, that app looks great and I was going to buy it but their search of lakes on their website does not list Bernard on it, however I still may get the app for my iphone as it looks like a useful app to have. I think tomorrow I will try calling some bait & tackle shops up that way to see if they sell lake contour maps and I'll just get it when I get up there.  Thanks for taking the time to read this thread and help out with some recommendations."

802423,RichNavionics,2013-08-09 15:25:00,22,"Hopefully this winter Navionics will release sonarcharts in Canada. this is where certain humminbird plotters can record their sonar logs, upload them to navionics, and within a month (for lakes that we currently have zero data) new contouring will be available when you update your platinum, navionics+ or navionicsupdates charts. If the chart presently shows up on our maps, the process will take a few days. But for those lakes without any data, we have more work to do, like using satellite imagery to acquire accurate shore lines. http://www.navionics.com/en/sonarcharts."
