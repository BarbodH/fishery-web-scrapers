If some members recall I've posted up some pics if nice bass in the past from this place and I'm happy to say my buddy Dave got his OB largie and me a PB samllie. I know I don't post here very much life, work and all, (more creeper) but thought some may enjoy. Me and some random rock My new back lake 12 footer My buddy Dave with his PB largie. No weight or measurement. Myself with a PB smallie. Some random pics.      All fish were realeased to be caught another day. All in all the numbers were down, but the size made up for it. Tight lines, Pidge."
