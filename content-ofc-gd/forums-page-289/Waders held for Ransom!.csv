I have decided to hold these waders ransom.  The price?  One ""guided"" fishing outing.  Either beating the banks this fall.  Or somehow fandangeling me a morning on Terry's new rig!!"

801757,misfish,2013-08-05 15:13:00,29133,LMAO  Thanks buddy for going back and picking them up.DOH. I was by at 5am to get them.  A river bank day for sure.  Atleast we got a couple of hours on the water before being blown off.    
801758,misfish,2013-08-05 15:15:00,29133, Your a mean fella.LOL
801799,NAW,2013-08-05 20:42:00,4022, Ya.  The morning started out great.  Was really hoping for some top water.  Brian and I with our sippy cups heading for the cabbage patch.   Brian's float tube rig.   I would have snapped a shot of you battling the white caps in your float tube.....  But I didn't want to drop my phone in the drink!
