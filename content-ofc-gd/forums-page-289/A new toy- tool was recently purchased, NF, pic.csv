801918,chris.brock,2013-08-06 17:19:00,4053,"with all the downed trees from the storm around Gull Lk, my little Sears chainsaw just wasn't cutting it (excuse the pun), so, with my back healing (too quickly actually), I pulled the trigger (excuse the pun again) on a new Stihl, seems great, it is a heavy saw to work with though  "
801933,lew,2013-08-06 18:16:00,12766,"Nice choice on the saw Chris, Stihl makes great products"
801934,aplumma,2013-08-06 18:31:00,6896,Good choice on the saw for sure. I have Husqvarna saws one is a great big commercial saw 268 for trunks and then a lighter limbing saw makes the day of wood cutting easier.   Art
801953,davey buoy,2013-08-06 20:27:00,5505,"What a difference a saw makes !!! Really,not worn down or tired after using it."
801957,porkpie,2013-08-06 20:55:00,2521,"There are really only 2 saws worth owning, one is a stihl, the other is a husky!  I am a husky guy myself, but there is nothing wrong with a stihl!  Dolmars are decent too, but there isn't really much dealer support here!  Nice choice!"
801961,misfish,2013-08-06 21:08:00,29133," Yup. I bought the 16in for just that up at pops. He,s got a couple of brutes for the trunks. The 16 just zips them off,and you dont even know it,s in yer hands.  Nice purchase."
801962,DOS,2013-08-06 21:11:00,119,"Great saw, got the same one> It will bog down when you really give er, but it wont kick back on ya.  Keep a spare chain with ya, and keep it out of the dirt and you will cut many chord of wood with it.  5 years on mine now and I just replaced the bar this spring.  I burn 8-10 BC a winter, it has cut every piece  RED"
801963,davey buoy,2013-08-06 21:14:00,5505,"Nice!!  ,something to keep in mind."
801990,Ralph Field,2013-08-06 23:49:00,1018,"Great saw, but I liked your dog better."
802003,Twocoda,2013-08-07 00:58:00,4130,13 years of abuse on my stihl...and its still cutting...let me reiterate ABUSE....Johnsered are pretty good saws as well as the Huskies...Ive had them all...but ...Stihl will always be in the arsenal...but i wish Partner Saws were still to be found
802030,wormdunker,2013-08-07 02:51:00,1711,"Yup, I love my Husky 353.  Lightweight, cuts very fast.  I don't need larger than 16"" bar.  If larger -  my wife says the logs are too heavy to carry??"
802193,Sinker,2013-08-08 01:56:00,8692,"Nice! I can't tell frron the pic, but looks like a 365 or so, with 18"" bar. Pretty big saw for trimming trails and a bit of firewood, but its a great machine that will outlast you more than likely. I have one just like it, but only use it for big stuff.  My 265 with 16""bar gets used for everything you could imagine, and I have an old 008 that is super handy for many, many things.  Can't go wrong with that purchase. Take care of it, and it will do everything you want it to do.  S."
802234,HTHM,2013-08-08 05:07:00,4082,"Simple, get a stronger wife. Problem solved."
802248,wormdunker,2013-08-08 11:38:00,1711,Way to go HTHM!  I like your humour.  Or were you serious??
802257,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-08 12:30:00,1362,"Nice saw...looks like it needs some use...  I've got a Husky 570 with a 20"" bar and a smaller Husky 345..  I better get goin on the log pile instead of sitting here surfin the net...  "
802269,mattybculp,2013-08-08 14:01:00,388,You wont be disappointed with a stihl product!
