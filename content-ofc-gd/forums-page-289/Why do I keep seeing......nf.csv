802177,shane,2013-08-08 00:38:00,652,Why do I keep seeing drivers looking down at their crotches and laughing? Seems like half the drivers on the 401 are doing it.  Male and females!
802178,kickingfrog,2013-08-08 00:45:00,8333,They think no one can tell what they are doing.
802185,porkpie,2013-08-08 01:33:00,2521,I watched a dude sideswipe the jersey barrier at 100kph on the 401 a few weeks ago.... Just kept on going till the next exit.  Wonder what he was doing....... Lucky he didn't kill someone!
802187,Sinker,2013-08-08 01:37:00,8692,"One more reason I hate the 401!! I'm glad the weekend is over, because a lot of those dumbasses were on the roads and water around here. Always in a rush, and can't drive!  S."
802232,Toad Hunter,2013-08-08 05:02:00,261,I typically had girls laugh at my crotch.. haven't tried it on the fellas
802250,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-08 11:55:00,1022,I would guess majority are trying to hide that they are texting while driving and maybe they read a funny message.
802252,Rich,2013-08-08 12:07:00,3927,"Kinda stupid to make a law stating no cell phones. We have that policy at work. Boy is there ever a lotta people laughing at their pockets or behind books, not a single person without a phone though... Hmmmmm..."
