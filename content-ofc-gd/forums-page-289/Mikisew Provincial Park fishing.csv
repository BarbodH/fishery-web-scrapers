I hope to get into some rainbows or specks as this is what's hi lighted for the lake online.  I know how tough they can be at this time of year but I've had some good success on similar lakes in the summer trolling small crank baits and spinners.  I would assume I'll do better on bass as they're always willing to play, but are there any Mikisew vets out there with any advice? Thanks in advance. T"

801926,Can_38,2013-08-06 17:52:00,152,"just got back from a weeks vaca on Eagle Lake & caught 100% bass + 1 pike, mainly used electric to go in/out of docks with spinners in morning / aft and switched to top water after 8pm.  Our cottage was near the northern tip therefore I primarily stuck to the north side of the bridge where the marina is.  Now my bad news.....I will start a new thread later tonight after I am able to upload a few pictures.  Doing aprox 15-20mpg I hit a rock (not marked) and snapped my skeg completely off   I was hoping folks from this forum will be able to provide feedback or suggest a marine shop willing to weld a new one."
