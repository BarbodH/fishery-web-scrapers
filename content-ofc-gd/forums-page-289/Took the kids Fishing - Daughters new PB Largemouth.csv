My son started catching several bluegill and my daughter had not caught a fish for a while. She was still pretty happy because we had practiced casting in the backyard and I was letting her cast.  She was casting like a pro with a spinning rod/reel setup. Well we finally see her float go down and I tell her to set the hook and she does. It took us a while to get the fish in on 6lb line and keep her away from all obstructions by shore. The fish was 19"" and my daughter was so excited. She is no longer scared of holding fish, and I was so proud of her reeling the fish in, holding it and then wanting to let it go. We were also able to catch some smaller bass. We caught 4 bass and 6 bluegill in 1 hour of fishing before the heavy rain started.     "
802195,Sinker,2013-08-08 02:00:00,8692,Good stuff Matt! I had my niece and nephew out for their first fishing trip from the boat over the weekend! Kids love this stuff! She will never forget that fish!  S.
802201,dhickey,2013-08-08 02:29:00,1038,"Nice. My daughter got 2 on her own last Saturday. Not 19"" but 18ish.  The smiles are incredible. Its kinda funny how the kids get the front of the boat and a little coaching.    So worth it..."

802261,Shloim,2013-08-08 12:59:00,515,"Ok, my wife just gave me heck for taking my kids (7 and 9 who love fishing) fishing opposed to wonderland or something similar. Now there is an air of truth to that I'm sure, but whats wrong with it? Out on the water in the woods opposed to standing in 2 hour lines all day to go on 2 min rides....BTW ive been taking the kids solo more these days as my wife has some back troubles. Those are awesome pictures of your kids which made me think. Sorry to post on your lovely page..."
802262,mattyk,2013-08-08 13:05:00,2110,Thanks guys. Shloim I agree with you I would rather spend the time outdoors in the woods or on the water rather then stand in line at a Canada's wonderland.
802274,quickme,2013-08-08 14:29:00,261, you know how much money you saved by going fishing instead of Wonderland?!?!?
802276,quickme,2013-08-08 14:30:00,261,I love their fishing vests!   Looks like the kids had lots of fun.   Nick
