Also big thanks to the forum for pointing out the launch at Sunrise Resorts. The owners of Sunrise Resort were just as unbelievably friendly and helpful as many have posted here!  About the fishing:  Lost 2 nice bass and lures with leader problems. Went with tackle store monoflorament leaders that untied. My local tackle store generously built them for me and they looked rock solid. One untied from my line (my fault) and the other from the leaders knot (tackle store fault). I know there is a thread here about it so I'll give it a read. Crazy glue time on the knots?  Pretty sure I was on a muskie early but let it run 20' while looking for my net. Went to reel in and being unprepared cost me... Lesson learned.  Ended up with a few smaller bass and one very large Black Crappie, never seen one before.  After spending 2 days on the lake I have to say its now one of my favorites. Beautiful lake and beautiful weed beds, not too busy and my pontoon was able to slip carefully into the hidden rock areas.  Have to read up on the ""leaders"" thread as I have a few days lined up for LSC in 2 weeks!   "
