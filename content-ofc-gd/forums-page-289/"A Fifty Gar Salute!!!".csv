801421,Headhunter,2013-08-02 14:01:00,5703,"Hey Bunk, fantastic report and pics! Got a question for yah... In my youth, growing up in London, we used to catch many a gar at the Springbank Dam, but none in the sizes you are catching. Mostly 24 inches or less and never did I spot anything bigger. Those small gar simply didn't have a chance to fight, or couldn't. Once we got their nose in the air, they were just motorboated in. Fun way to pass some time and have some action, but not really any kind of ""sport"". Curious as to how those obviously bigger gar scrap... Thanks,  HH"
801424,RickOnt,2013-08-02 14:14:00,669,Hey Bunk  Another amazing report.  Pics and story are fantastic!!!  Thanks for taking the time  Rick
801446,Moosebunk,2013-08-02 16:14:00,3970," Foghat's Foghat was one of the first 5 LP's of my dad's that I borrowed and recorded to cassette in my teens.  Love that album.  Had the same gar question on a private board elsewhere too Joe.  Catching bigger gar in the 48-55 inch range is similar to catching pike of 35-40+ inches.  Caught a fair share of both on basically the same gear. By length/weight the average 40-inch pike is about 16 pounds, (range 12-20) while the average 50-inch gar is about 15-16 (range 14.5-17.5) Simple physics is that two equal masses pulling against a same resistance should result in similar force needed against, right?  Though either species will have that odd fish which will totally surprise you and give a better or worse test than you calculated for.  I’d give advantage to the pike for speed and stamina, yet gar can certainly be more aerial and cunning. Yet with gar, it’s the sight-fishing and hunting aspect, getting them to take, visualizing that, and keeping them hooked which makes them their own unique kind of challenge, so what they might lose in fight they make up for in character.  But oddly still, they're rather similar in fight time and their ability to surprise you with several good runs. You’re right too Joe, catching smaller gar is quite boring because there is no fight. I’d say 45-inchers and up is where things get interesting, but 50 and beyond is where it’s at.  The story of Townsend Miller’s battle with the 72-inch, 50 pound World Record can be read here...  http://www.tpwmagazine.com/archive/2008/nov/legend/  The length/weight conversion chart for longnose gar and other gars is here... The fish I’ve weighed and measured relate more with the 1962 chart but are often found somewhere inbetween it and the 2000 chart.  http://www.garfishing.com/weighttables.html  Also, caught some short video of a 20+ pound gar reel peeling me during a great fight last year...

801460,Headhunter,2013-08-02 17:46:00,5703,"Thanks for the reply Drew... Fogat Live was the album that caught my attention, which of course meant getting all their others as well! Figured a fish of that size would have to put up a good account of itself. BAck in London in my youth, we would target them using either floating jointed Raps or loading up a treble hook with pin head minnows and hanging that about 6 inches below a float. We could watch them feeding on schools of bait, their snouts popping out on the water's surface and cast the bait a close as possible. Many a frustrating time keeping them hooked, that's when we started to use the treble/minnow combo. They did get airborn from time to time giving us a first hand look at how they toss your bait back to you! I wish we had come across some bigger fish like yours, but even the small ones are quite interesting to get up close and personal with. Thanks again Drew, awesome post!! HH"

801595,Moosebunk,2013-08-04 02:12:00,3970," This is actually a band of my teenage youth who's album was likely almost ""Classic"" Rock by the time I was born.  Dad's collection was awesome but the first five I grabbed were, Foghat, Pink Floyd's The Wall, ZZ Top's La Grange, Saturday Night Fever and Deep Purple's Machine Head.  I liked them in that order too.  Foghat's album was my Saturday morning music.  4, 5, maybe 6 years highschool and college, I had a mindless job driving a van, picking up and delivering groceries, putting in orders, stocking shelves... I  could do it blindfolded and drunk but I was usually sorta hungover and fuzzy-eyed from getting in way late on Friday nights.  When I recorded the LP onto cassette I actually screwed up and put the B-Side on first, making this tune the one that kicked off my driving EVERY saturday.  It was probably my favorite then, but the whole album has a tonne of miles with me and I love it still.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1fMH1rQJJA   Anyways, couple more pictures I liked, so I'll throw 'em in here to get locked down into the report someplace.

802284,S.M.05,2013-08-08 15:53:00,145,Bunk you totally cruised into to the gar-dens of Gar-land and grabbed your 50 gar-badge with some crazy gar slayn skills.
801325,Moosebunk,2013-08-01 20:20:00,3970,"A Warship would fire its cannons harmlessly out to sea, until all ammunition was spent, to show that it was disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. This naval custom quite adapted, ""A Fifty Gar Salute,"" chronicles the beginning to end of 2013's exceptional fishing season battling with giant gar.  Longnose gar are prehistoric. They are an adaptable, fast-growing, durable species with no predators in this region other than themselves, and even their eggs are toxic to humans, animals and other fish. Without any reference I would have to guess they are some evolutionary link between the Ocean's needlefish and the World's wetland crocs and alligators. Interestingly, I have heard they can reach fifty years of age, although I have not found any literature supporting that wild fish actually live longer than about twenty years; or captive fish to thirty. Females are the older, larger and I will say wiser of the sexes. Day or night hunters, double-scaled for armor, good peripheral vision, a sometimes wily, aggressive demeanor, and a beak-full of pinpoint teeth ready to turn and snap under strong jaws, gar are the nightmares of anything in the water that might just fit down their throats. To help them breathe and tolerate their preferred shallow, warmer, summer habitats, gar are able to gulp air through their nostrils and fill an overly vascular swim bladder for added oxygenation beyond what their gills can provide. Because of this, they can actually live for a short time out of water as long as they remain wet. A gar's weakness I have found are their soft fins and tail. Careful control and handling; and maybe even not using a net, will do wonders in helping protect them. These are a fascinating fish supposedly quite sensitive to human pressures and sudden ecological changes, (extinct this century to Europe) although they have been around and evolving since the age of dinosaurs. In Ontario the distribution of gar ranges all along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, including some inland rivers and lakes, making them available to much of our angling population. In our waters I believe a fish greater than 48-inches to be a great catch and 50's are trophies, akin to catching trophy class northern pike at forty inches. Our current Ontario Record lists a fish at 20.1 pounds and 54-inches, although fish beyond this mark are regularly seen and caught in some home waters. The Official World Record longnose gar is Townsend Miller's Texan brute at 50-pounds caught in the 1950's. A great link to view a more recent angler's catch and report of a possible near World Record 61-inch longnose gar caught in Texas, is found here...  http://www.fishing-headquarters.com/boundlesspursuit/2012/04/18/monster-fish-april-15-18/   My gar fishing this year started a little cloudy, both figuratively and environmentally. It appeared the season would be cut short, as it had been planned during prime-time that I would be somewhere on the Attawapiskat River. This 10-day Northern stretch was cause for work shifts at home to be condensed pre and post trip, thus limiting gar chances even more. Add to that the late spring, unpredictable weather we'd been having, and a second trip booked during the later end of gar season, what opportunities might be garnered remained a big mystery. All that could be done was to simply wait and see how it unfolds. 2012 had been so good to me though, with a dozen days out, friends and family along, plenty firsts and personal bests, a 20+ pound catch for myself, six other fish boated over 50 inches and many, many more 48 and over, there was this intense urge to build on that great year and chase gar again with even more determination. I'll admit, there's little akin to hunting for big gar, so anticipation ran high until that first day arrived.       MISSION 1. SOLO 1.  Shoving off the dock at the launch, I waved to local legend Big Jim with a guide and received his smile and hello in return, they had it in mind to seek out some gar too. As I rolled into a corner of the bay with those fellas gliding in behind, the first fish of the season I spotted just might have been the biggest. So here I go... an audience, a huge fish, so much investigating to still be done, my nervous knees started knocking while trying to place casts to that one big gar, until it spooked away. Plenty of water to fish yet, the two boats divided and we didn't see each other much thereafter. Over the afternoon amongst a few fish in the high 40-inch range, I also managed to boat my first 50-incher of the season. It was from that point on I decided this year I would not photograph myself with anything less than a fifty, and so the idea of ""A Fifty Gar Salute,"" was born. Begged the question, did this early thought (or maybe goal for that matter), effect the outcome of the season? You will see.   MISSION 2. BREN.  It's rare with Bren's new practice, Ju Jitsu schedule and the girls that she takes a day to join me in the boat, but on this weekend she was willing and able. There are many things about her I love and respect. Her patient determination and all she has overcome in her life. Her strong will to always improve, achieve and succeed. Her care for others and her endless energy, just to name a few more. She is a woman who gives me the longest leash a man could ask for, and loyal to her I would rather not wander far but instead have her fishing more by my side as we grow old together. On this day we searched the gar out, she took a handoff for her first then hooked a couple more on her own with some coaching and practice. Bren's third fish and personal best was a 50-incher, adding another one to the boat's total. For what Bren would call ""an ugly fish"" before, she found a bit of a new appreciation for. By the time this report gets posted, she and I will nearly be off for a week to chase walleye and pike back in our northern home.                 MISSION 3. FLOAT & MAGNET.  Us three in the boat it's like having Obi-wan, Luke and Solo aboard except with all of us playing all three characters at any given time. It's a fun ride. In my story book, Floaty doesn't get left behind either, and gar has been something that for a number of years he's been wanting to cross off his lifetime list. So, this spring during a mint day we warped into some shallow galaxy, probed around 'bout twenty minutes, then discovering a long gar stationed on the surface totally in an open shipping lane, the man during his excitement fired a cast probably 500 yards beyond his target. Collecting and correcting himself he shot again, this time on the mark, destroying his first gar. Later that day, after battling many more fish between us, Patty captured himself a great 50-incher as well, before he and I chased down an absolute beast bogie gar we stumbled on out in some deep space. A fish on the run from many casts, it engaged me and I cracked her hull hard. Well beyond fifty was this Jaba, and by some measurement standards light years from one end to the other.           MISSION 4. SOLO 2.  This was a day for me that all other gar days will measure up to. The chaos of it was absolutely mind-blowing and exhausting, but during one late afternoon on the water it must have gone so perfectly smooth and calm because had it not, it probably couldn't have happened. Keeping chill while fishing and handling the fish is so utterly important to catching and photographing gar. I was alone, just one pair of eyes, one pair of hands, a camera on a tripod, big fish crossing my path one after another, and in the span of just a few hours managed to catch, photograph (only the 50 plus fish) and release a 54, 53, 52, 52 and 50 inch gar, as well as a 49 and two 48's that were sent swimming immediately after noting their disappointing lengths. Over 400 inches of gar, alone, and all eight of them four feet and longer. The Fifty Gar Salute only allows the qualified fish pics get posted, but you'll get the idea... it was totally amazing fishing here at home, a day anyone hopes for. Do I believe in a lucky shirt too... yeah, this one has some memorable miles on it.             MISSIONS 5&6. SOLO 3.  Two different days started out great but were cut shorter by cloud and breezy conditions. Weather this season for gar was hardly ideal at all yet to my surprise it didn't slow down the big fish bite one bit. I was only four trips into the spring with nine fish over 50-inches, already bettering the great fishing conditions during 2012's dozen outings for seven of the same size. Online weather this year often forecasted for ideal days but because the water was high and cool for so long, when the days sun began heating the land convection winds were actually strong enough to really screw over the ability to sight fish. Not only that, the variable temps seemed to increase afternoon cloud cover more than what was experienced the previous two seasons, and some days the morning haze just didn't burn off at all. It's while fishing solo and facing such challenges that these types of thoughts come to mind more often. Why this, why that, how is it affecting this, how do I adapt, where are the best chances, etc? Like it primarily was living up north for those years, the freedom for continual, uninterrupted thinking and experimentation on the water is probably every bit as important to individual angling growth, as is say the media and fishing with others. It's also a great opportunity to really study if you're not too school for cool. Before these two afternoons would finish, two 53's a 52 and a 51 would get boated, but the best photos came because of being forced to really slow down during the scan for fish, and stay stealthy while working smaller fish-able areas with extra care.                  Continued..."
801326,Moosebunk,2013-08-01 20:22:00,3970,"Maybe sooner, but somewhere around this time I had to pull the plug on the Attawapiskat trip. The original week long dates had been pushed back a week and I was OK with work for that time, but when the ice still hadn't gone out up north and the trip was pushed back another week, it basically landed on where all my work shifts had been changed to, and there would be no way to find coverage of 60 hours over two full weekends. It was a bummer having planned, paid and been looking forward to joining a good group of guys. That aside, gar fishing had already been more fulfilling than I expected it would be, this while the trip had been a go and, now I had a pile of time off and nowhere to spend it except right here at home. C'est la vie? Only a few prime weather days presented themselves for gar while off though, and so in the meantime I picked up a few extra shifts, enjoyed two different walleye openers, played with crappies, and in good time jigged up some of them quality Rideau lakers.   MISSION 7. SIMON.  Simon and I hadn't fished together in years, not since 2007 in B.C. for sturgeon and prior to that for Niagara lakers. When he mailed asking to visit from Cambridge for a day, there was no chance I wasn't going to make gar happen. After announcing his long drive on Facebook, it was great to see him again once he arrived the evening before. Next morn we saw the girls off to school then hit the local greasy spoon for breakfast. It was forecasted to be windy; and it was, but actually not as bad as originally thought. Simon needed to best a low forty incher from some years before, and within about fifteen minutes of fishing he did just that. Simon means business, loves to fish, and will travel far if he chooses. Because of his triple threat, the local garthority was hastily investigating our day out fishing... As it turned out, Simon certainly is another threat, he is intelligent, experienced and driven. Our day on the water was perfect timing too, as the fish were stacked like cord-wood in a few isolated pockets and we made out like bandits. Self-control to not cast at the dozens of fish in view required some serious will power, and so it was with Simon that he quickly learned what is worthy of his casts, and what is a pass. His new PB a grotesquely thick 52.5 incher was one of the two fifty and overs he caught that day, along with a 48 and 45. My restraint for pulling the trigger was a little off though, and for what I thought were 50's actually turned out to be four fish at 48-inches, except with one large ""photo qualifier"" for the guide's sake.               MISSION 8. MIKE.  Hard not to return next day with perfect conditions and such an intense concentration of fish, but not return was exactly what I did. Scrambling late to find a partner my friend Mike came to mind. One of the nicest fellas you'd ever meet, salt of the earth, raised up on Lake Clear. Over the winter I had told him about gar and when I land-lined that evening and learned he was totally game to fish on his Birthday... well perfect, it was meant to be a gift anyways. So exploring a new locale, came off plane in a bay, stepped onto the deck, immediately saw a big fish, asked Mike for my rod behind me, took a cast, then handed him a 50-incher to reel in. Another boat fishing gar nearby, in the next 38-minutes Mike caught a 51 and reeled in a 52 as well. Spot not just burned but completely blown off the map in an hour, we took off to fish other areas throughout the rest of the afternoon. Took some cool shots along the way before some clouds rolled in around 2:00pm and ended things early, but Mike's Facebook quote that night still read, ""Thanks buddy. Had a great time, they sure are fun to reel in. Best fishing day ever!"" HBD Dood!                   MISSION 9. MAGNET 2.  When Pat and I fish it always seems to be an education of different styles working well together. Too many examples to write about I will say this, if I'm fishing one way he is certain to always be doing something different, sometimes so completely opposite, but yet we'll both be catching fish. For me he is a real and honest pioneer gar angler of the Ottawa, from the earlier days of fishing forums. He has shared selflessly with others his ideas and fishing spots, not to hold any title or rule as to returning or enjoying gar, and he's also been a supportive angler who genuinely applauds his friends when big fish are caught. An all around good guy to hit the water with, we've certainly had our fair share of days fishing together. In keeping with that, before his departure to guide the summer on Hawk Lake Ontario and then Kasba Lake in the Arctic, we managed one more fun day chasing gar during his final week at home. Conditions I remember were quite off as the morning haze never burned, and so we were stuck with low-light for the duration. Not surprising though, in due time and effort we did spot several great fish throughout the day and managed to each pluck two super-solid, rocket razor beakers. Hope he is having the time of his life right now with the colossal lakers, pike and grayling found up on Kasba.       MISSION 10. DAD.  Awhile back I popped a pic up on Facebook with a caption that read, ""cold, dark & dirty day on river for gar'n, but through any muck & mire, dad always helps me see things more clearly."" Always my teacher, a biggest fan, the leader of our pack and a best friend, any day on the water with my father is time well spent. With gar, I think he could actually care less if he reels one in, makes a hook-set or poses with a catch, for with him I get the sense he is just happy to be along. Our day started off alright weather wise and we managed a good fish early, but some hazy clouds and a western breeze built up in the late morning pushing us into search mode. Trying to see deep without light and peer through ripples made for a slow afternoon. When we did spot fish we were often right on top of them and they were freakin' out. Despite this condition, before heading home we did get the hooks into one more goodun. Over these short three years dad is building quite the personal collection of great gar photos.        MISSION 11. LEAH.  The season's end had to wait and that meant the final report would as well. Gar fishing had been exceptional this year with ten missions, nine of those catching one or multiple 50 plus inchers, 22 that size in total and too many to keep track of in the 48 to 50 range. There were also a number of PB's and firsts for some happy friends and family and, that one unforgettable day of eight giants with five of 'em in the 50's. It felt good knowing that I not only built on 2012's solid fishing year, but did so during tougher weather windows and a shortened time frame overall. Leah was my only consideration to holding back from the finish though, because before our departure to Nipigon she mentioned that she too wanted to catch a gar like her big sister had in 2012. After seeing how well she did handling walleye and pike, a little tentative we made a day happen. Because these are fish as big as her with a lot of teeth, my worry was her safety being photographed with one. We devised a strategy that if a fish thrashed, she was to push it away and quickly get back from it. Well, of course it would happen that way too. After reeling in her first gar and just before picking it up for a photo, the fish squirmed on the deck and Leah shoved it right back in the river. She was stressed, the fish sensed stresse, yet despite a little scare there was no harm done. Much like her mother, Leah is determined, and so after reeling in the next gar she did perfect. I love my littlest trooper and this captured memory is simply another cherished collectible from hopefully her lifetime of great fishing.               And so with all the gartillery fired, the garsenal emptied, the white flag waving in peace, and ""A Fifty Gar Salute,"" this 2013 season of battling with the awesome and giant gar is officially laid to rest...     Bunk.  "

801361,Moosebunk,2013-08-02 00:28:00,3970," That is a good one though Rob, for sure.  I can see it in the future, photos all in B&W and really provactive poses.  Big girls only and all over 50 again.   Some hot stuff man!    Thanks again as always guys.  Photos were a real process in this one, just hacking them down to favorites from a big selection.  A very cool fish to get those ""in nature"" or face shots of.     You are surely right that not all will like the endless stream of fishing reports. No silver spoon up this arse though as some readers might wonder, those 40 to 60 hour (even 80 hour) work weeks I did in early career, while isolated in places few in my profession will even consider working. Ten years of it to create whatever benefits possible for today. Shorter thirty hour shift-work weeks now, and plenty time to fish is one good result, yet still the job in ER can be taxing in other ways, so having the release of fishing 2 or 3 times a week is balance. Didn’t find it Brian, created it. Have thought a time about writing articles again, or even guiding for work, but have a hard time tainting the fishing ways presently enjoyed, some ways that are actually work in sense as well... Wouldn’t trade this fishing life I don't think, it works well. Although truth is, have dealt with some hate unto me and still have a little in me to give because of it. Learned that jealousy and hate with some people is simply a reflection of their own shortcomings, and I am not immune to suffering that same illness at times... But on these sites for me it’s really just show and tell it how it is man, a little kid playground ego, and yet also a pride in personal craft and even a giving back in some manner. Maybe get some good in return to come from the efforts. It’s that way with many others online too... and if there are actually people who truly can’t see that in a positive way for whatever their reason, then I guess let them be pissed off, jealous, or maybe even haters, because it’s not up to me or anyone else in this place to fix them, ya know?  Appreciated that response Brian, got me thinking.  A good one for sure and thanks again as always bud.  When you get those 3 or 4 days sometime, think about checking in with me dood."
