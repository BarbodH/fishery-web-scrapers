801838,Freshtrax,2013-08-06 02:56:00,2215,Was working in the fields today with my younger brother and he unearthed this... Any ideas of age?  Can't find any serial numbers or markings looks to me like a .22.   
801839,Muskieman,2013-08-06 03:05:00,2472,Nice !!
801840,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-06 03:06:00,10439,Have no idea on age but it does seem to be an old 22. Looks like the bluing is kinda worn though.
801850,bigugli,2013-08-06 11:45:00,6138,Neat find
801857,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-08-06 12:25:00,535,Cool find! Get chum lee to see if it fires.
801873,dave524,2013-08-06 14:40:00,4508,Looks like what is left of an old Stevens Crackshot    edit: yep pretty sure that's what it was  https://www.google.ca/search?q=stevens+crackshot&rlz=1T4GZGN_enCA451CA451&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=slsBUt2TKIHHqgHHp4CYDQ&ved=0CC4QsAQ&biw=1920&bih=901
801955,kickingfrog,2013-08-06 20:44:00,8333,I would have thought the synthetic stock would have held up better than that?  Very cool find.

802056,wormdunker,2013-08-07 11:19:00,1711,Yah the bluing is definely going to need repair??  Good one Drifter!
802086,kickingfrog,2013-08-07 16:48:00,8333,Better (safer) then what they find in the fields in Europe.
802118,pidge,2013-08-07 20:44:00,438,"That's neat. I e got no Info on it, but that's pretty cool."
