801536,harse77,2013-08-03 12:08:00,4,Going out on the grand river today near lake Erie. any advice on where to launch the boat? I was thinking Dunnville at the conservation area. We like to fish for bass and pike. should we go in at rock point?
801553,Broker,2013-08-03 14:49:00,482,"Unless its a big boat I wouldn't launch at rock point, most likely to big of waves. If you plan on fishing the river itself there is a launch at fishmasters, one at the pier and one up towards the Dam. Have launched once at dam and I believe it was $5, that's the only one ive used."
801579,Rich,2013-08-03 21:08:00,3927,"The launch in port maitland is free and very well maintained.  To fish more the river area I'd launch at fishmasters, hes not right up close to the dam but hes on/near some real fishy water. I think he still charges $5.  The dam launch is good, but steep, and you have to leave your truck/trailer parked in a not so desirable neighbourhood. It's $5 i believe."
801604,wormdunker,2013-08-04 10:18:00,1711,"Go to Fishmasters, good launch, cheap - bonus - he'll provide some tips on where to fish."
801618,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-04 13:00:00,8243,"The ramp at the bridge behind the large empty lot that was the old marina is the Dunnville Boat Club, great ramp $10.00. As far as a undesirable neighborhood, the entire town of Dunnville may be deemed undesirable to some.  Steves ramp at Fishmasters is also good at $5.00. Beware there is a concrete ledge where a trailer can get hung up on if you are too far in.  Forget PT. Maitland on the weekend, might not get a parking spot."
801700,Garry2Rs,2013-08-05 01:52:00,1425,There is also a launch behind the Grand Island Bar-B-Q
801718,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-05 07:39:00,8243,"Grand Island BBQ went into receivership, it is closed and for sale. The son took over a few years back and couldn't make a go of it. Sad to see."
801862,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-06 12:58:00,1022,I know far too well. 
801960,Freshtrax,2013-08-06 21:06:00,2215,Launch at the lake is free and has tons of parking.
