802215,TJQ,2013-08-08 03:30:00,7806,Major rain today at camp.. unearthed these?    I think they are wood stove cranks that stirred up the coals in the stove.. anybody else got any ideas?    
802216,Muskieman,2013-08-08 03:36:00,2472,Think so too ( spring handle )...we found some very similar by Sarge a few years back .
802217,TJQ,2013-08-08 03:38:00,7806,It just weird.. cause there were three different ones .. all together.

802219,irishfield,2013-08-08 03:41:00,26272,HMMM.. so once upon a time someone else drank whiskey in that exact same spot...
802220,Muskieman,2013-08-08 03:48:00,2472,"I see the size of your thumb now .. I sent the picture to my brother , he recalls my Dad having some ,  my other brother apparently has them ( says the wood is burned off ) has no clue what they are ."
802221,Muskieman,2013-08-08 03:50:00,2472,Look like some kind of drill bit or rasp to me .. a prospectors tool. ... TJ ?
802231,Entropy,2013-08-08 04:51:00,747,"Yep, wood stove ash crank thing."
802235,Sinker,2013-08-08 05:51:00,8692,"I would say they are the turn outs from a coal stove, not wood. Someone probably used the stove for wood, and dumped those right where you found them.  S"
802236,Roy,2013-08-08 06:07:00,13728,"Yes, we had those in our coal furnace in the 50's. The 3 of them mesh together.  Edit to add: Here's a link I found. http://www.woodmanspartsplus.com/4865/Stove-Grates-Triplex.html"
