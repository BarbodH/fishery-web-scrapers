The fist 100 people to raise $200.00 by Friday will have an extra $100 added to their total.  Every little bit helps and it  goes to a great cause  as you all know.  I tried to imbed the links but was unable to do so, my appologies.  Thanks for all your help and support to date, it's very much appreciated.  Maureen On September 7-8, 2013, I'll be participating in a very special event called The Shoppers Drug Mart® Weekend to End Women’s Cancers™ Benefiting The Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.The Weekend is almost here, and your donation will make it possible for me to reach my goal—of walking, and working toward a future free from women’s cancers.I've committed to raising at least $2,000, but I've set my personal goal at 2500.00. Use the link at the bottom of this email to visit my site and make an online donation to support me.When I reach my fundraising goal, I will walk ""approximately 60kilometres in two days ! with thousands of other women and men. Every dollar we raise will IMMEDIATELY go to support breast and gynecologic cancers research, treatment, and services.I hope that you'll share this incredible adventure with me and support me in my fundraising efforts.
