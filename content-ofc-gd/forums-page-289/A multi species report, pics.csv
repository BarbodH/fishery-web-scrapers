801929,chris.brock,2013-08-06 18:03:00,4053,"a typical day at the cottage, some solo fishing  first on the list was to see if the lakers were cooperating.  here's my view from the seat in my pontoon boat    I caught 2, both really small     with the sun getting low, I switched over to bass, caught a few, nothing huge though    with the sun getting even lower, it was time for walleye, I guess the secret's out on this spot (take note JohnnyB)    I caught 2 and lost a third, all fish released  "

801970,northernpike56,2013-08-06 21:35:00,717,nice picture of the boats- it seems pretty cool that all of the fish would actually be congregated in an area that small.

I tried between 40-80ft down. Usually get a few, but not even a sniff.  That pontoon looks nice and comfy!  S."
