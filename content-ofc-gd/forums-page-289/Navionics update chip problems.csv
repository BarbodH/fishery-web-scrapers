797917,JamesG,2013-07-13 14:59:00,32,Has anyone picked up the navionics update chip yet?  Mine wont update from my nav gold card that came with my elite5.  Navionics assures me it can be...  Has anyone else had a problem updating?
797939,steelhunter,2013-07-13 19:10:00,81,When i just did mine it took 2 tries but it finally got the updates I also have the elite5 from radioworld
797956,JamesG,2013-07-13 21:53:00,32,"I tried on 3 different computers with no luck.  did you do anything different on your second try?  it seems pretty straight forward.  plug the new chip in, unplug, plug in your old chip, and that's where it says it cant update....  i'll give them another call Monday.  its just tough during the day when i'm working"
798128,steelhunter,2013-07-14 20:39:00,81,I did nothing diffrent just logout reboot log back in and it worked I tryed at about 8 pm at first hen again at 2 am
802422,RichNavionics,2013-08-09 15:19:00,22,"the simplest trick for updating Navionics charts is this: Delete all Navionics programs on your computer (except for 'PC app'). They may say 'navservice', 'navionicsworld', navionics chartinstaller'. Then try the update again. if you still have problems, contact me directly. [emailÂ protected]"
