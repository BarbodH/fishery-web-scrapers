As soon as I pushed her close to full speed the engine would rev high, but, go nowhere. I took her in to a local marina service, and, think I didn't describe my problem correctly as they thought it was a fuel problem. After doing some online searching, I'm leaning more towards a prop problem.  The motor is only four years old, and, still runs okay at anything less than 3/4 of full speed.  Any thoughts, or suggestions are appreciated.  Cheers, Frank"
