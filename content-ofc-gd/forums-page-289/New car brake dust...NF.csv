801544,lew,2013-08-03 13:14:00,12766,"My daughter just purchased a brand new Honda Civic this week and now, with only a couple hundred kilometers on it, the 4 wheels are covered in heavy brake dust and it's even visible on the rear fenders. I ran my fingers thru it last night and it came up black, like you'd find in an exhaust pipe from a car in desperate need of a tune up.  Dealership says that's normal for the 1st few thousand kilometers but doesn't sound right to me. Hondas are great cars and she's had a couple of them but this heavy brake dust is something I've never come across on a new car before.  I buy a new truck every couple years and have never seen that before, but I'm kinda fanatical and wash my truck every few days.  Anyone know for sure what's up ??"
801547,Muskieman,2013-08-03 13:31:00,2472,"My Mazda6 did the same , I'm thinking it was the materials used in the pads , I replaced them with Raybestos SGD series pads and it hasn't happened since .."
801548,Roy,2013-08-03 13:34:00,13728,This might be an interesting read for you Lew. http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/brake-dust-a-problem-thats-not-really-a-problem/?_r=0
801549,lew,2013-08-03 13:56:00,12766,"Hope it doesn't come to replacing the pads on a brand new car Randy, but she's gonna take it back to the dealership on Tuesday and see what's up.  Thanks for that link Roy, it was a good read and it sure seems like alot of vehicles have the problem. Hopeully the dealer will do something."
801552,irishfield,2013-08-03 14:33:00,26272,Gives her a reason to come see you each Sunday Lew... so you can power wash her wheels!!
801554,lew,2013-08-03 15:00:00,12766,"She already does Wayne, and old dad washes it every week"
801556,NANUK,2013-08-03 15:48:00,797,"Common with most new vehicles, Some vehicles have ceramic pads, not as much dust. makes you wonder what we are breathing driving down the road."
801577,aplumma,2013-08-03 20:57:00,6896,Lew you also might look at what the wheels are made of. My painted wheels of gray showed brake dust readily while the chromed brakes on the eco boost hide/shedded the dust much better.   Art
801584,lew,2013-08-03 21:46:00,12766,"I know what your saying Art, but this to me seems really excessive and I've never seen brake dust on the rear fenders, specially on a brand new car only a couple days old.  It's going back to the dealer on Tuesday but it won't be a problem as she also works there."
801608,ketchenany,2013-08-04 10:56:00,3229,"Wayne, my kids have no brake dust and they come anyway lol  Today with husbands and kids 14! happy to have them:)"
801609,Bernie,2013-08-04 11:01:00,3190,"Hi Lew.Not often I see this on new cars, usually on vehicles that have had ""inexpensive"" brake pads installed.This can be cured with the use of better quality pads.This is somewhat surprising considering it's a Honda. I guess competition between brands is forcing cost cutting everywhere.I'm curious what the dealer will do to solve this. I looked in my database for service bulletins regarding this, but nothing in service bulletins yet."
801610,lew,2013-08-04 11:12:00,12766,"Thanks Bernie, I appreciate you checking into the bulletins on this.  I called a couple different Honda dealers yesterday and got complete opposite answers from them. One said it sounded about normal and the other said it sounded very excessive  As I said above, my daughter works for the dealership where the car was purchased, so I'm sure they'll look after it for her but I'm gonna suggest an upgrade on the pads."
801614,lew,2013-08-04 12:26:00,12766,"If anyones interested, here's a picture of the rear fender just behind the wheel. That black crud is also all over all 4 wheels and the rear fender on the other side.  I can't see how this could possibly be considered normal on a brand new vehicle only a few days old.  "
801616,Roy,2013-08-04 12:42:00,13728,I would not accept that. Ever.
801617,lew,2013-08-04 12:45:00,12766,"Yeah, it's pretty nasty Roy but I'm sure they'll do what's right...hopefully"
801619,Roy,2013-08-04 13:07:00,13728,"The problem is that the dust is highly corrosive. Honda's slogan is ""The Power of Dreams"" Call them up and tell them that you're going to be their nightmare."
801624,aplumma,2013-08-04 14:41:00,6896,no that does look excessive Lew I was thinking it was less and not that visible. Even my Sprinter does not make dust like that and it has a goodly amount of weight I control.  Art
801625,salmon,2013-08-04 14:47:00,334,"Lew Usually when my car has brake dust it is mostly on my rims, I have not seen it like that in the photo. Jose"
801626,JamesG,2013-08-04 14:52:00,32,"if the vehicle sat for a while before being delivered the rotors tend to get some surface rust which would cause some excess dust, but it should go away after a week."
801628,Lape0019,2013-08-04 15:17:00,647,"I had a 2007 civic that was white as well with disc brakes all around. I never had brake dust like that so unless they changed their brake pad manufacturer or something, there would be no reason for that much dust to accumulate so quickly."
802062,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-07 12:47:00,1022,I have only ever seen brake dust on the wheels.
