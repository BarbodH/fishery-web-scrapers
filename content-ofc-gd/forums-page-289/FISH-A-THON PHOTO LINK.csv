Thanks, again, to all the participants and sponsors for helping to make this another special day for all.  Over $13 000 raised in the fight against cancer!  Even the rain during quite a bit of the day didn't dampen spirits.  What a great group of people!!  Look forward to seeing you all next year.  We at the organising committee will strive to make it even better.  We're already toying with a few ideas/changes to make things run even smoother.   Enjoy  http://s813.photobucket.com/user/6FRANKIE5/slideshow/Fish-A-Thon%202013"

I've been trying to get a family report done for the Fish-a-Thon but not having internet at our temporary residence doesn't make it easy! lol  Hopefully I'll be able to get my re-cap up ASAP.  Cheers, Ryan"
