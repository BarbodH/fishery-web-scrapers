801660,scugpg,2013-08-04 20:42:00,1373,I currently don't use a transom saver on my small outboard and the skeg sits 7 inches above the road when in transit. am I cutting it close? Will likely raise the motor and or get a transom saver in the near future but wondering if I should be ok in the meantime?  Thanks
801662,ctered,2013-08-04 20:48:00,40,"I would definitely raise your motor. Although the 7 inches may be good on flat ground, if you enter/exit a parking lot at any time you may end up dragging it on the ground. The same could happen if you come to any speed bumps."
801686,Ralph Field,2013-08-04 23:15:00,1018,Perhaps you should take the engine off and carry it in the boat or in your trunk. Is it possible to tie the tilted engine to a transom support for now ?
801687,Terry,2013-08-04 23:24:00,14456,tilt it and stick  a 2x4 between the motor and  the transom mounts
801727,wormdunker,2013-08-05 10:27:00,1711,Get a transom saver.  Will save your skeg & wear n tear on the transom.  CTC $60.00 for a good solid one.
801733,scugpg,2013-08-05 12:14:00,1373,thanks guys I'll slap a transom saver on there just in case.
801770,Freshtrax,2013-08-05 17:51:00,2215,"I trailer with mine down,  I feel it is the most secure way to trailer. I use a ratchet strap to keep it from bouncing... However you must always be mindfull of your load."
801782,irishfield,2013-08-05 18:53:00,26272,"Is what I do as well FT... I tilt my kicker up a bit on the hydraulic and then ratchet strap it to the back of the trailer to stop the bounce during the tow. Be cautious and note that ""transom savers"" relocate the movement and forces to the engine hinge and it you slam on the brakes and the boat moves forward at all it will also push your motor up as well.  Good advise on speed bumps and going into parking lots... all stuff you have to think about before you do them, not different than towing an RV trailer or driving a motorhome. The only place I saw a 7"" Plus speed bump though was the 16"" wedges in  St. Marteen and they sure were fun in the jeep!! (as long as you made it from one to the other in the air)"
801902,fishboy,2013-08-06 16:37:00,550, agreed...distributes any bumps and keeps the weight off the trim/tilt cylinders...marine mechanic told me it's a far more cost-effective solution
