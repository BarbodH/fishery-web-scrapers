801646,Bill Shearer,2013-08-04 19:55:00,456,"I have walked that stuff while hunting. It is a truly unique experience like walking on a trampoline, but with less bounce. All is good until you go through it, and find yourself up to your armpits in bottomless slop. You learn to tread softly. Fishing it would be unique."
801685,Ralph Field,2013-08-04 23:10:00,1018,"There are some, like me, that couldn't tread lightly enough on that stuff and would disappear in short order. I'm glad we have better fishing opportunities here."

On a number of occasions I've portaged over very similar stuff in far N/W Ontario. Most notably a 3 day portage overland from the headwaters of the Frog river (a trib of the Winisk) over to the Fawn. That's world class brook trout country and you've really got me wondering now. Lots of little interconnected potholes just like that up there.  Pure hell to portage through. Only bonus was the ability to drag rather than carry the canoe. Still I ended up waist deep in quagmire a million times, and the blackflies were beyond brutal."
