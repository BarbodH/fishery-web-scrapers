802247,Billy - Curtiss,2013-08-08 11:34:00,241,I think I'll be heading up to the Collingwood area next weekend and would like to hit it. I've never fished this river before. Anybody know what water levels and clarity are like generally at present? I'm not sure what to expect species wise but I'll have access to a canoe hopefully so getting around to loads of different spots shouldn't be difficult. Any insight would be massively appreciated!
802266,SirCranksalot,2013-08-08 13:28:00,3291,Water is still high and muddy downstream from Minesing. I understand it's dropped and cleared quite a bit upstream around Angus.
802273,Freshtrax,2013-08-08 14:26:00,2215,Not after yesterday.... Muddy and high...don't bother the salmon any if your chucking spoons
