The kids are having a blast pulling in one three inch fish after another.  I am frustrated... Guess that is what vacation is all about sometimes, trying time and time again to accomplish what you wish and realizing that no matter how hard you try , what you wish for is not always going to happen.  Can't wait to get back to the fish filled waters south.  Dial up is certainly something I will never get used to .  Hope everyone is well, as I noted there are fish being caught when Team ""Up Scalers"" slipped into third place.  Cheers and happy fishing  Jen"

96504,Doop,2007-07-21 03:08:00,22,That was going to be my comment exactly!  lol  While you are on vacation watching your children have the time of their life...i'm about to go outside and fire up the lawnmower.  It's 98 degrees outside by the way.  After that...I think I'll take the trash out and do some dishes.  Feel better yet Jen!??  lol  Enjoy yourself
