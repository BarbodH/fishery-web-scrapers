95526,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-18 20:07:00,1351,"so i finally got a bow mount instead of the transom mount on the front... before the transom mount directly connected to the battery but now the bow mount has a plug, so i already bought the receptacle for it, to add to the boat. now, for the receptacle(boat peice), it's only about 1 ft to the battery, do i need a fuse to add to it??? what gauge water would be good? 10 AWG?, since it's very short, only the 2 foot MAX, i assume i don't need to add a fuse? even if i do need one, what amps? and this would be for a 55lb minn kota powerdrive with copilot and universal sonar, if that matters...  thanks!"
95536,Whopper,2007-07-18 20:35:00,2174,I would personally still install a fuse or a circuit breaker. #10 wire should be good for that short a distance. Should have been some installation instructions with the unit to verify though.  Whopper
95541,misfish,2007-07-18 20:51:00,29133,40 amp inline fuse will be lots.

95547,JFR,2007-07-18 21:13:00,498,"Save yourself some grief, 40amp in line should work.  Make sure it is an automotive time spade fuse, you can pick up the fuses and the waterproof fuse holder at most CTC or auto supply stores.  The fuse holder should be attached as close as possible to the positive terminal of your deep cycle battery.  Good luck,  John"
