Over a period of 4 years I was hospitalized 17 (I kept track) times, until they had to do a second operation 2 years ago, which fixed it for good! All I can say is I had the BEST medical staff in the world (North York General Hospital) looking out for me. There was a notation on my chart, when I came in (or was brought in) that got me into a cot and hooked up to demerol within minutes of arrival, in emerge! We may b i t c h about our medical system at times (and rightfully so) but over-all, I should be dead now . . . .     and BECAUSE of the excellent care (with exception of a few l'il 'blips' I can still tell my fishing stories, AND DEFEND MY CARP!! (When needed . .   heh . . .   heh . . .    heh!)  P. S. / M. B.  Your description of the pain is VERY accurate!!"
