96612,spoonman,2007-07-21 18:27:00,103,I need a spotter for a one day salmon tournament held out of bluffers park. As a spotter you get a chance to go out the water for day and learn some great techniques from some of the best salmon fisherman around. All spotters must attend a mandatory meeting on Friday Aug 3rd in the evening and then be ready to go by 5:30am on  saturday august 4th. This is a lot a fun and a great chance to spend a day on a boat with a bunch of pros.  Here is a link to the tournament with more information. http://www.enticerlures.com/Shootout/index.htm  Anyone interested please pm me asap. Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca
