I've always heard that walleye feeding activity is much higher during the full moon, but can't say I've ever consciously paid much attention to whether this is true or not.  Most of you fish a lot more than I do, especially for walleyes in Canada. In your opinion, is the walleye activity better during the full moon?  Thanks...as always, I appreciate your insights."
96273,tonyb,2007-07-20 14:57:00,1637,"It can be, but I've also been skunked when targeting eye's under a full moon.  The best part about it is that there is enough light that you can see what you are doing!"
96283,ehg,2007-07-20 15:19:00,2666,"Some will say just fish whenever you can go, but i did notice my 2 largest walleyes were caught as the sun was setting and the full moon was just rising.  Good Luck,  ehg"
96302,ADC,2007-07-20 15:54:00,82,"Ive had a few fishing calanders that say so. I believe it affects all fish species.  I do think it will increase your odds but, dont forget to factor in everything else that makes for good fishing!  P.S. - Did you know that the full moon affects humans?  It can delay time reactions and overall focus by a 10th of a second or something (dont quote me on that figure). Thats why people seem a little bit slower and brian dead during the full moon time. Also, there seems to be an overall spike in car accidents and such during a full moon. Spooky huh"

96345,TennesseeGuy,2007-07-20 17:12:00,957,"Lots of big fish are caught two days prior, during and two days after a full moon, but that doesn't mean they're going to be easy for your trip.  Always fish hard and smart in case the bite is off a bit or the weather messes with you."
96475,danc,2007-07-21 01:50:00,4677,"The full moon is only one factor (but an important one) in the equation. There's a few more besides that. When everything lines up, look out."
96527,SBCregal,2007-07-21 08:21:00,688,"would the full moon help with the ability to see the bait at all? would that explain it, or its it alot more involved than that? i imagine if you used a dark/bloack lure it would stand out more with the light a full moon provides, no?  I actually have no idea, but I was curious about the same sort of thing.  i don't get out enough to actually practice half the ideas i have unfortunately"
