The pond was accessable, but the lily pad growth was hard to cast over / into.  I was using a light bass spinner with a white skirt.  No luck there, so I walked towards Center Island.  Meet some nice fishermen who talked to me about the Trout Pond and then I moved off to Center Island.  There I ran into another fisherman who gave me tips about where to look for pike.  I saw some beautiful carp, and what I think was a small pike that looked like it had koi markings.  I then switched to a panfish jig and began poking around the small lagoons (tiny bodies of water off the main channel).  Then I hit the motherload.  A baby (4 - 5 inches?) bass sucked down the jig on the first toss.  Yeah! I smile with pride at my first bass ever.  He's dropped back in, and I move along about 10 feet and run into perch!  Perch! Wow! 2 nice colourfull perch about 6-7 inches each.  One was feisty, one was hooked deeply, so I did my best to return them as fast as possible.  I've never caught perch before, so this was great!  A few more casts in that general location and I ran into what I thought was a goby based on what I could see in the water, but nope ... it was a baby (6 inch) bowfin!  And you've probably guessed by now that I've never caught a bowfin either.  Now if I could only manage to find one of their parents..."
