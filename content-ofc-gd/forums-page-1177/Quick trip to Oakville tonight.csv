Would have been more but took me for ever to get around the closed streets in downtown Oakville. Water still cold - 51-52 degrees in 35 to 100 feet. Tons of fish and bait fish in 30 to 60 fow. But tough bite. Gote one small salmon so my son was happy and that was it. Tried all colors nothing. This just confirmed my opinion not to go fishing in the PM...never seem to do well at that time of the day. I guess the tough fishing on the North Shore will go on for a while longer....until water gets warmer. Anyhow...hope for much better day tomorrow on Erie ;-)  Here is my happy captain:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
