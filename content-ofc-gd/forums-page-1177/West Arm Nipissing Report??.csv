We'll be taking off next Saturday for the West Arm of Nipissing and from what I have seen the weather looks great, but does anyone know how the fishing out there right now?  Is there anything hitting exceptionally well, pike, musky, eyes?  Any last minute advice would be great and hopefully we will have some pics and a story to tell when we get back.  Have a Great Week and Thanks In Advance For The Help."
