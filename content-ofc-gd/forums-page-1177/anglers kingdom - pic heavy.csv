94598,pikeman2,2007-07-16 17:51:00,3,"Hi You’all My first post I’ll start easy and work up. Been fishing Canada for 35 years Been all over Ontario and once to Northern Manitoba. Done 9 fly-ins. Last 3 years been going to Angler’s Kingdom In fact I’m at AK now. Kind of neat being able to get on the net up here in the bush. My first trip in 05 was for 7 days I returned for 4 weeks in 06 and I’m here for 3 months in 07. I guess you can say I’m a lifer.  This summer has been incredible. Lots of big fish, met a lot of great people. Can't imagine a better place to spend my retirment summers I've been learning the lake and finding tons of hotspots and have many stories to tell I'm going to try to post a few pics here Once I get this figured out you'll be hearing more from me.

94860,pikeman2,2007-07-17 03:45:00,3,Thanks for the friendly welcome. Are my pics supposed to be so small How do I make them bigger.  Here's a few more Bear with me I'm still learning.    I've been lucky enough to fish with some great people this summer This is Ken Ellig with a beauty he caught the week of June 16th we were 5 minutes from camp fishing a ledge gradually dropping into 45 feet. the fish was in 24-26 feet. He caught it on a Jig and minnow. We've caught quite a few big walleye in this spot. Here's one of mine from that same day.   This is Kens wife Alice with another from the same spot.     We pulled a few decent pike that day as well.   that's it for now see you tommorrow. Any ideas on how to do this are appreciated.

95481,rrichards,2007-07-18 18:35:00,5,Hey pikeman2 - I met you up there last year - we had a crew from pa and jersey (Rocky) and David -- we fished at little Vermillion this year with Kevin's brother - both places are great and we'll return. hope to see you again -- was it any easier getting your boat in this year?
95487,TennesseeGuy,2007-07-18 19:09:00,957,I was wondering how that big black motor and boat made it over the portage.   Seems like a project for a winter road.  I met rrichards in June and hope to see pikeman2 this season.  I'll know who to follow so we can find big walleyes.
95510,seifjr,2007-07-18 19:48:00,1,"Pikeman2,  A group of 12 of us are coming into camp Saturday around noon.  Half the group has fished the lake beofre, but we have 6 newcomers.  I'm looking forward to meeting you during our stay.  Having you been fishing the deep reef off of Gull Rock much?  Is Flat rock above water due to the high water levels?  Anything you can share with us on current conditions would be appreciated.  Seifjr"
95644,PatrickGG,2007-07-19 01:34:00,562,"Great report, makes me want to retire early and fish more often  ."
95672,Mike the Pike,2007-07-19 02:52:00,3421,Wow great intro and nice walleye welcome to the board.MTP
95673,little angler,2007-07-19 03:00:00,128,welcome and nice walleye!
95914,pikeman2,2007-07-19 20:16:00,3,"Haven't fished off gull rock. water is still high. flat rock is out of water ( If I'm thinking of the right rock)  I'm sure you know the lake is an awesome walleye lake.  Orange jig heads tipped with minnows are good. Of course yesterday white, black, pink and I'm sure any other color would have worked excellent. It didn't seem to matter what color. some people swear by spinner rigs, I Like vertical jigging. Location is important. I'll share a few with you when you arrive. I'm sure Kevin will share some as well. He does with everyone (including me) depth is 20 to 30 feet for the bigger ones. I've boated about 30 over 25 inches and only one was not on a jig. I've used orange most days Hot pink was good yesterday.  I've been doing some trolling with Gramma lures as they produced some 30 inch walleyes for guests last week. Just have to share pic of Angies 30 incher.  Hi Rocky Glad you had a good trip again this year. See you here next year.  Tennessee Guy I was really looking forward to meeting you. Kevin always says what a classy individual you are. I understand you are coming up August 4.  I won't get to see you as I have to leave by end July to attend my daughters wedding. Hope you have a successful trip. I'm sure Kevin and the guys will treat you royally. Anything you need just ask DJ. How close are you to Dale Hollow? Fish there several times a year for 27 years. Stayed at Star Point.   By the way how do I make my pics larger?? Anybody??  Gotta go catch some more fish Here's the best the most recent. "
95934,TennesseeGuy,2007-07-19 21:21:00,957,"We'll be at AK from August 4 - August 17.  I appreciate your advice on colors and depth.  I'm about 45 miles from Dale Hollow and 16 miles from Center Hill Lake.  Several years ago I took a box of my home made Kwofit Hofit Lager to Larry and Sherry at Star Point.  They knew what to do with it.  Crazy Hoosiers!  Google up ""Photobucket""  for a free download.  It'll size your pictures just right for the board.  I'll be on Nungesser for my first time ever and am looking forward to finding nice walleyes.  Probably some huge pike hanging around the walleyes waiting for a stray to make a mistake.  Hope you have gas money left over after Daughter's wedding.  My best to the bride and groom."

96278,BryonG,2007-07-20 15:08:00,52,Looks like a wonderful place. I am coming up mid September to check it out. We have fished around Minaki and Ignace for many years and are looking for another place to add to our Canadian itinerary. If it is as wonderful as it appears to be it could become a permanent fall trip for us.Has anyone fished Nungesser  the last half of September?
96658,fishindevil,2007-07-22 01:13:00,6254,"Welcome aboard !!!!!!   you will like it here,lots of real cool people....and yes thats a great report & catch for sure,gotta love those fly-in loges for sure,well done thanks for sharing    cheers"
