96516,holdfast,2007-07-21 05:00:00,1813,"Walleye can be caught at the Short Turn.  Live minnows is key.  At dusk or night, fish rapalas in the Petawawa where it meets the Ottawa.  If your buddie is in the service ask him if he can get through Range Control and fish Montgomery Lake.  Huge Musky.  Otherwise try to get in from Algonquin Park.  You just need to be 30 meters inside the training area to find the Muskey hole.  Where Montgomery and Mc Manus Lakes meet through the narrows"
