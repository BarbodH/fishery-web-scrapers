95956,HotelTango,2007-07-19 22:30:00,21,"Hello  Just joined the site recently, I figured I would introduce myself. My name is Marc, I am originally from Ottawa but i now live in Pembroke. I have been a member of the armed forces for 8 years now all in Petawawa. I have been fishing most of my life. I mostly fish for bass both small and large mouth aswell as pike. I love the area around Pembroke/Petawawa as their are lots of good lakes and rivers to fish. I usually got out at least twice a week in my boat. This year i have been trying out lots of new water and it has been real fun, as funny as it sounds I hardly never fish the Petawawa/Pembroke part of the Ottawa river but that will change. This is a great site, lots of good info on it. Good thing too stumble upon while surfing.  Cheers Marc"
