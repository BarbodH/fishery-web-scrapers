Also if anyone has had any success there within the last month it would be greatly appreciated. I bought a boat a few months back and I think it is cursed. I have been out probably about 5 times and haven't managed to boat anything which is really starting to tick me off because as soon as I jump in a buddies boat I can't stop catchin fish. The boat was painted this hunter green color so I came home tonight and figured I would paint it and crisin it by breakin a beer on it. I hope this works.  Cheers  Gnoddy"
