But,  Has small sites, Local fishing is poor unless I'm willing to drive 35-40 minutes, and I have a real donkey hole neighbor thats given us a bit of greif. So long story short We're thinking about taking advantage of our trailers wheels, and trying somewere new next year.  My wife and 2 little ones are beach Gals...so proximity to a decent beach is a must And preferably with in 3 hours of Kitchener...allthought I would go further, the wifes not big on long hauls  I have a few spots in mind but I thought I'd tap into the expereince here and seek out some suggestions? Cheers,"

Try Provincial Parks and Conservation Parks.  We are looking at putting our little trailer in at Elora Gorge for most of next year.  Sites are around $1200 for the season."
