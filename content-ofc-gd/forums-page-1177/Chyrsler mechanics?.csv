96338,Tybo,2007-07-20 16:56:00,1373,"Rick, to get rid of the power steering wine. Drain the power steering fluid and fill with tranny fluid."
96341,Bernie,2007-07-20 17:02:00,3190,There is a TSB on the power steering as well. The reservoir has a screen that plugs up restricting the flow through to the pump causing a cavitation. Chrysler dealers have the parts in stock. Very common problem.
96371,bigbuck,2007-07-20 18:03:00,2449,"If you can't find Seafoam, at least go to Crappy Tire and pick up a couple of bottles of injector cleaner, put 2 in with a tank of premium gas (91octane) and go for a highway runs, drop to about 80km/h, punch it up till it shifts and repeat 3-4 times. That will clean up carbon and any crap in the cylinders. I'd do it with my old supercharged bonnieville and she ran like a top when I got rid of her with 320k on the clock. If it really goes away after an oil change, it may be a lubrication problem with a lifter or 2. Try an oil additive to clean out the oil galleries before your next oil change and go with some heavier oil for the summer like a 10w40 or 15w40."
