96025,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-20 00:04:00,0,Has anyone ever seen a baitcaster made out of plastic? Apparently it is an Olympic Triton 707. I brought it to Aikemans and he said It was a gem. Never bothered to ask him how much its worth.

96132,camillj,2007-07-20 03:20:00,1988,well .. since Plastic was only invented about 50 years ago ... it aint no antique I am afraid ... but it may be a collectors item none-the-less
96169,OhioFisherman,2007-07-20 09:14:00,6623,"Johnny, I don`t think the reel is worth much. Up front price at the time of original sale has some factor in the worth of an older reel, quality reels when they were made usually command a higher price because price was a limiting factor in the numbers made and sold.  The used to be a lot more different brands made and sold, a lot of stores had store brands made by reel companies but with a store brand name eg., JC Higgins I think was Sear`s home brand, Ted Williams may have been one for Sears also.  It might have a little value to someone that collects that particular brand, but I see nothing special in that reel. I was into the older Abu`s, but did buy a Langley once, price was right and it was the first baitcaster I remember using."
96195,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-20 11:23:00,0,Thanks. I'll just throw it on the pile of old reels I have.

96375,misfish,2007-07-20 18:12:00,29133,"Nemo I asked that site way back about a real I had,they never to this day gotten back to me.  It was about this reel,remember?           I would say Johnny it is worth something,just dont trash it in a box."
