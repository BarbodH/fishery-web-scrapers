There's gonna be plenty of muskies boated, lots of laffin and many miles put on the truck and boat trailer in the next couple weeks.  I'll be spending alot of time lookin for muskies on the Tri's & Stoney, and am fishing with Meeley next Monday.  Next Wednesday & Thursday myself & Smokey will be chasing muskies on the Mighty Ottawa River and is a trip I've been looking forward to since we both fished there last October.  Have fun everyone and I'll see y'all in about 17 days....maybe"
