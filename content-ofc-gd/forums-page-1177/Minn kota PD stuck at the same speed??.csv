96437,Gerritt,2007-07-20 23:13:00,6129,sounds like a potentiometer problem to me.  Gerritt.

96446,Terry,2007-07-20 23:25:00,14456,simple xpla   it's the knob on your stove to change the different temps  ok it's behind the knob
96449,Gerritt,2007-07-20 23:34:00,6129,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer  basically controls voltage... think of a light dimmer switch...  Gerritt.
96451,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-20 23:35:00,1351,anyway to fix that? even when i use the copilot it doesn't work.. i assume that part is in the motor then and not in the pedal?
96454,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-20 23:38:00,1351,"side note: i just bought this from a fellow OFC er.. he said it was working this past weekend.. and for those that didn't notice, i just put in the receptacle just now, but found out the fude holder wire is only 12 guage and gets pretty.warm/hot so i will have to change that, so i just connected the motor directly to the battery to see it running at the moment.."
