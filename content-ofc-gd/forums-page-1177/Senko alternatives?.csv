Otherwise, the vast majority of cheap sticks - the ones with the ""hook slot"" in them - are all made in the same place, so get them for the best price you can.  You can make Senkos last longer in several ways: 1) after the nose gets torn up, just bite off the first 1/2"" and re-rig it. It keep working right down to about 3 1/2"" on a 5"" senko  2) save the one with the torn up noses and use them for wacky-rigs. Orings work, cutting thin rings from cheap tubes works as well.  3) rig them backwards after they get torn up  4) save the short bits and use them as jig trailers. It looks stupid - southern smallie fisherman call it the ""dog turd"" jig - but it catches smallies."

96236,Guest mistyriver1,2007-07-20 13:01:00,0,Just gave the Komanchi's a go this past week and am very pleased with them.  The Wizzlers work well.  Mizmo's work pretty good too.
