89949,Joey,2007-07-02 02:00:00,9122,"Enjoying some down time    Funny thing, I bought these fake fish tatoo stick on's in the city and put them on my ankle one day, then at the end of the day I had white fish spots on my legs where I had tanned around them    I got some amazing scenery and wildlife shots.  I chased this woodpecker all over camp trying to get the perfect shot    This beetle was very large and flew, ewwwwww    The pinchers of a wood beetle             Every day threatened a storm, but it just seemed to miss us, until Thursday.  We stayed out this time because everytime we came back worried about a storm, nothing happened.  This one, however, did happen, and it was a doozie.       Man did it rain.  It came down in buckets and hailed as well.  Lots of lightening and thunder.  We hid in our gazebo.    We kept 4 pike out of all the ones we caught and I cleaned them and they are sitting in the freezer at Kevin and Leslie's    So that was our week and Lakair and I want to thank Kevin and Leslie for being great hosts once again and Zach for attending to us all week, you were fantastic.  Thanks everyone for making this holiday a memorable one.  Cheers,  Joey & Tybo"
