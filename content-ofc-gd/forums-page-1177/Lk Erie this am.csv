96543,pikehunter,2007-07-21 11:55:00,1659,"Nice catch! The big lakes can be dangerous. There has been many times I have gone to Pt. Mait. and turned back because of the conditions. Be careful and don't stray out there when it's blowing. Even if it isn't bad when setting out you really have to keep watch over both shoulders, it can change so fast. You probably made a wise choice when you called it a day."
