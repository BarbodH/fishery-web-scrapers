95963,pikehunter,2007-07-19 22:47:00,1659,"Good job Dave!  I have to get around to say hi one of these days soon.  BTW, we were out on the river on Sun. not a thing, had a bight or 2 and caught nothing but a stick. It appears that the eyes have all moved out into the lake."
96184,Fish Farmer,2007-07-20 10:50:00,2234,"Uncle Buck, Red Fins are a must for me. Gold color, and Micheal Jackson, has done me good. The only thing they don't make the Jackson color any more.  Roy, when I'm by myself I like running way back, no need for all that heavy stuff on your line like Dipsy and boards. Slowing down then speeding up helps trigger hits along with zig zag turns. I know when I run 4 to 6 rods that could be a challenge with tangles.  Fishmaster, I see your boat was gone When I came back in and your truck was there."
96189,Roy,2007-07-20 10:57:00,13728,They took the Jackson pattern off the market. Seems they had a colour stability problem...they kept fading to white.
96191,Fish Farmer,2007-07-20 11:02:00,2234,Thats why I haven't been doing good with them lately. Good one Roy
