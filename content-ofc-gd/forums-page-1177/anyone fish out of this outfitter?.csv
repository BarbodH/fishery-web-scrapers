96491,Doop,2007-07-21 02:39:00,22,I was thinking about booking a fly-in trip to an outpost from Northwest Flying Inc.  They are based out of Nestor Falls and will fly you in to an outpost lake at half the cost of most outfitters.  Half the cost because you are sleeping in a tent.  Does anyone have any experience with them?
96611,Doop,2007-07-21 18:14:00,22,Let me ask this...would sleeping in a tent in northern Ontario be a bad idea?
96613,danc,2007-07-21 18:27:00,4677, I've done it many times. I'd suggest bringing a gun of some kind with you in case you run into bear troubles though. Especially on a fly in with no quick way out.
96646,Tacklebuster,2007-07-22 00:10:00,303,"never heard of the organization, but I don't see a problem sleeping in a tent.  As long as you don't keep you food in your tent, and hang it in the trees you won't have a problem.  Been camping for 30 years and have never had an encounter in our camp with a bear.  Had moose go through our camp though.  do you bring your own tent, or does the outfitter provide one of those propector tents."
