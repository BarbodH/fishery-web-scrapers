Getting up at 4 am just to run the son to his job sucks. Can't wait til he has a decent set of wheels.  Now I'm just browsing through OFC and the tackle catalogue before I run to the fishing show.
553272,Terry,2011-02-19 10:59:00,14456,I'm up because my brain still wanted to go fishing.. but the body knows to stay inside
553275,bigugli,2011-02-19 11:01:00,6138,I know that one only too well.
553277,Handlebarz,2011-02-19 11:22:00,3790,Dang this is sleep in time here but when you get up all week for 3-4am it makes it hard to sleep in. I do get more done before am then the rest of the day no one else up to slow me down other then OFC LOL.
