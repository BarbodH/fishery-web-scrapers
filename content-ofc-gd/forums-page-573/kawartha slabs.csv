553871,kingofthesteelhead,2011-02-21 01:45:00,140,Tried a new kawartha lake today with the intention of getting some perch and maybe some crappie. Got to the lake around 1200 noon and the bite was slow to say the least. Starting moving around and found about 9 feet of water. One my first drop my shad bait didn't make it to the bottom and up came a nice crappie. For the next 2 hours I caught around 35 crappie and kept these 15 for dinner. They were hitting on small pinheads and my shad body jig very slowly jigged.

553926,Handlebarz,2011-02-21 12:10:00,3790,Nice slabs for sure for the guys not catching them you are most likely fishing to low when you see on your finder a bunch of bait up high get your gig up there as you missing the crappie.
553938,Billy Bob,2011-02-21 13:15:00,5865,SWEET
553987,kingofthesteelhead,2011-02-21 15:12:00,140,"I do not use a fishfinder,but when I fish for crappie I start at the bottom and work my way up to sometimes halfway up the water column.Surprising a lot majority of the fish are within 3 feet of the bottom."
