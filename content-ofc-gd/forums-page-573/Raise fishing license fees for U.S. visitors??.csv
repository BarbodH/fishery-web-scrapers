The 2011 budget for defence related expenditures are between 1 and 1.4 trillion which includes homeland security, the FBI, NASA, the military etc.....DO YOU feel safe??? Good Luck..I'm afraid the most vulerable will pay the biggest price......"
553363,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-19 16:51:00,835,This is what? couple weeks after announcing the new joining together for  North America security perimeter. I guess Canadian side  will be $5 per person less secure than the US side.   NOT If they want some money just ask and we will ^ give it to them.
553365,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-19 16:52:00,835,Well that didn't come out right.
553406,pics,2011-02-19 18:27:00,1268,Tough choices for sure...The American people are going to have to watch closely to ensure the goverment looks out for the common mans interest. 5.50 per person won't save them....
553583,Billy Bob,2011-02-20 12:29:00,5865," YES, I feel VERY SAFE....money spent on the military is money well spent IMHO....don't want to learn how to speak North Korean or Chinese or have to join the Taliban....besides, if you were to make drastic cuts within the military that would only add to unemployment across the globe.  I agree 100% about NOT raising taxes and we could stop a LOT of the FREE money give away programs at home and across the globe...  In NYS we tax just about EVERYTHING including bottled water and where has that gotten us.....most businesses have left to states that don't tax anywhere as much....  We need another Ronald Reagan come 2012....  We are a hardy bunch, much like you Canadians. We have been through this before and came out even stronger and will do it again....just look at the stock market.....it's getting better by the week....if it keeps this up I may invest in some new fishing toys.

552582,blue pickeral,2011-02-17 16:50:00,267,"As it struggles to rein in a massive deficit, U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration is looking to squeeze revenue from every possible source – including Canadians.  The President’s proposed 2012 budget, released publicly this week, suggests charging Canadians $5.50 to enter the country by air and sea to help pay for security checks and inspections at the nation’s airports.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/us-budget-proposes-550-fee-for-canadian-travellers/article1910967/  Would like to see a few U.S. operators in Ontario who charge in U.S. dollars taxed as well...."
552590,Billy Bob,2011-02-17 17:39:00,5865,I don't know about by sea but we have been paying this fee on our plane tickets since 2001 so you are not being charged extra for the security fees.  Obama promised no tax increases for the middle class...  :rofl2:
552646,aplumma,2011-02-17 20:09:00,6896,"This fee is charged by ALL airports whether you see it as a seperate fee or you just pay for your ticket. If you fly to the Mexico you will hand them $10.00 cash as an entrance fee. Their was a waver of this fee between Canada and the USA that is now no longer being waved. When you cross the boarder by land they charge you for using the bridge both ways ""for bridge maintenance"" whats the difference their?   Art"

553176,aplumma,2011-02-18 23:44:00,6896, Thanks for the generous offer but with this $5.50 cents we should be set   I however am proud to say I have left thousands of dollars in the Great White North traveling by land and enjoying the people and places over the years. I if it was in my power would apologize for passing on this outrageous expense and hope not to bankrupt the nation to the North of the USA.   Ambassador Art  of the Cajun Clan

553208,John,2011-02-19 00:46:00,2956,"Very profound there Ambassador Art, I like the way you think.  I fly though many airports in the course of a year and it is amazing the charges that are levied in the guise of security fees, airport improvement levies, congestion charges, call it what you like, $5.50 is a drop in the bucket compared to what is charged at Canadian airports and others around the world."
553264,blue pickeral,2011-02-19 09:09:00,267," More tongue in cheek than anything else....and although I can't figure out why Yanks are so resilient against public health care, greatly admire the accomplishments of their country!  However,this is a fishing forum....and whenever whenever we get beat up by such things as soft wood lumber duties, extra border charges etc. fishing, hunting and sledding are the only things that our American friends take seriously in terms of retaliatory measures....  .....still peeved at having to pay fishing lodge fees in foreign currency in my own country."
