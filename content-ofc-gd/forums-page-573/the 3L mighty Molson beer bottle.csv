This is one of the reasons I became a Moderator on this board just so I can see random acts of kindness continue here on OFC.   Art
549479,anders,2011-02-09 21:26:00,1168,"uhh...yeah...i had a bottle that broke as well    ....ummm...can i get a replacement?   kudos to them for replacing it for you....   know, back to my bottle that broke....."
549519,Sebastien,2011-02-09 22:17:00,2,"Thanks for the good word guys, that's what we do at Molson, we are involved in our community and want to engage our consumers, and that includes internet forums, Facebook, Twitter, etc...  Sorry for the other guys that sent me emails, we only had 1 bottle left for Geoff.  But since there is a lot of interest in these bottles we might just make it available in a near future!  Sebastien  "
549542,GBW,2011-02-09 22:49:00,8460,Thanks again Sebastien!!!!!!!!  I'll take some pic's as per our email and send them to you soon.

549549,GBW,2011-02-09 22:55:00,8460,now ya tell me...  I just tore a corner off one and nothing came out... I guess the karma of giving a homeless guy (one HH and I see all the time) a winter jacket finally came back to me.
549653,camillj,2011-02-10 01:41:00,1988,  If you do I'd absolutely be interested in a co-branding/co-marketing arrangement ... Please PM me ... if there is any chance we could make some up for Charity events etc...

532367,GBW,2010-12-28 17:06:00,8460,"Hey all.  I hope everyone had a good Christmas.  I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get one of these 2010 Vancouver Olympics 3L Molson Canadian bottles.  The reason I ask is my father-in-law got me one with some pic's at a silent auction.  it was his special Christmas gift to me.  Well, I packed it in the van thinking there is no way 3L of beer would freeze and the damn thing blew up like a grenade.  So now I need to find one to complete the gift once again.  BTW, it was full of water I discovered as I cleaned up my wife's van...  Any info either here or PM would be great, thanks!  Geoff"
532402,FUSION,2010-12-28 20:56:00,81, That was probobly a one off thing Molson did for promotion of the gold medal win hense why you father-in-law got it at an auction.
532403,GBW,2010-12-28 21:00:00,8460,I get that fusion and that's why I asked if anyone has a line on where to get one.
532404,irishfield,2010-12-28 21:00:00,26272,Question is.. who drank the beer.. refilled and recorked??? ;O)
532405,GBW,2010-12-28 21:01:00,8460,"LOL, my father-in-law I bet..."

532407,GBW,2010-12-28 21:09:00,8460,"DANG, do they offer a medal for beer drinking and or, well ya know    cause then I'll give it a go (so to say)."
532412,mercman,2010-12-28 21:22:00,7054,"You may want to see if EBay is selling them Geoff.I dont believe they were available to the public at all. I nosed around on th net, but not alot of info available."
