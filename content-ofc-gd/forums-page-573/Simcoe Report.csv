I saw a few on their roofs frozen into the ice. Some just frozen in. I ran across one of my cousins collecting pieces of his hut, it must of tumbled to bits. Real sad because he made it with his father just before he passed away. There were quite a few smashed up ones. Some huts just seem to be missing, Adam's rental hut is not were I last saw it, I hope he moved it. A loss to a lot of people.  The Ice was great and dry the snow is knocked down allot but drifts of new snow are a couple of feet deep in places. oh Yeah I'm talking about the innisfil side. No fish  but banked and secured the hut and will try again tomorrow."
