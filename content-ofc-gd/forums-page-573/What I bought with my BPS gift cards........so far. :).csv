I went with a 7' Abu Garcia Verdict MH casting which will pair up nicely with my Abu Garcia Revo STX which I already had and I also grabbed a 6'8"" St.Croix ""EYECON"" snap jig rod to pair with the Pflueger Supreme 9040XT I bought. (the one on sale for $69..reg $140). As much as I live for ice fishing....I can't wait for softwater now!  Cheers, Colin"

553464,kickingfrog,2011-02-19 23:10:00,8333,The next month or two will go so slow.
553465,mercman,2011-02-19 23:12:00,7054, Gotta love new tools!!!! PSSSST...........be careful around SRT8 he has a reel bad case of newboatitis.No cure available till April.
553466,solopaddler,2011-02-19 23:16:00,8605, Next to Oct and Nov the next month and 1/2 is the best time of year to steelhead fish.  Things are just getting interesting.
553471,danbouck,2011-02-19 23:30:00,4380,"You will love the supreme, I grabbed one and a new rod to go with it  "
553475,ckrb2007,2011-02-19 23:34:00,449,I think I will! I didn't just buy it because of the price. It feels like a good solid reel......nice and smooth.
553476,adempsey,2011-02-19 23:35:00,1498,I've been considering that reel for the past few days.  Did the store have many left?  Figured I would check out the spring show first.
553477,ckrb2007,2011-02-19 23:39:00,449,"When I was at the counter, I asked the guy if they had any of them left and he said ""do we have any left???... of course we do!!"" kind of like I asked him a stupid question.....then he looked at the shelf and said ""hmmmm, they were right there this morning."" I was thinking, great just my luck...none left. He did find one on another shelf after a few minutes looking, so I'm thinking that they don't have many left.......I could be wrong though."
553482,danbouck,2011-02-20 00:11:00,4380," On Tuesday they only had the 2 biggest sizes left, they will be out soon"
