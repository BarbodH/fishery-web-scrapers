Everything has hardened up, there's the odd lump of frozen snow that might send you for a ""bit of air"" if you're not paying attention, very good for ATV travel.  Crossed a couple of cracks, nothing more than 6-8 inches wide but frozen.  One fellow on a snowmobile was broke down from over heating, no ice scratchers.  He had a tow strap ready to go, I offered, he declined, someone else was coming to rescue him.  North of Fox at portable hut city people were getting some whities and lakers, maybe I'll go back tomorrow.  That's all."
553730,misfish,2011-02-20 20:52:00,29133, Hope my guide has his on.   Heading out in the am. Think were heading north from IBP.
553732,Fisherman,2011-02-20 21:03:00,7201,"Oh ya, wouldn't go without them unless you zig zag back and forth between the thin little puffs of snow.   Good luck."
553742,icefisherman,2011-02-20 21:53:00,952,"Great report - thanks.  Any chance of been able to drive a vehicle on the ice this week? I'd think with all the water from last week frozen it might be getting close?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
553749,Rob,2011-02-20 22:16:00,467,"  Emil I would wait until next weekend for vehicles. Where the slush was last week the ice was still thinner than everywhere else. Now that the slush is gone, it should firm up evenly with the cold temps they are calling for this week.  Rob C"

553803,ckrb2007,2011-02-20 23:35:00,449," Saw a couple mini-vans out around the Big Bay Point area this afternoon. Not recommended though. ATV travel was perfect out there today......in fact it was a perfect day all 'round. No wind, sun shining, and a few fish to bring home for supper."
553806,Fisherman,2011-02-20 23:37:00,7201," Although there were a number of cars and trucks out there, I wouldn't do it this year.  There are still spots out there under 12""."
553808,misfish,2011-02-20 23:44:00,29133,"Sorry to say,but when one see,s one out there,they think its safe.Stupid is, what stupid does."
553812,irishfield,2011-02-20 23:50:00,26272,I'll ride with you.. in YOUR truck Brian.. with the window down.
553813,walleyejack,2011-02-20 23:51:00,358," I'll ride with you Wayne,in the back of Brians truck with no cap !"
553814,misfish,2011-02-20 23:55:00,29133," The cap makes a great air pocket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,for a few minutes anyways."
