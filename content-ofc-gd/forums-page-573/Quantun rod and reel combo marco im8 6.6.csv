Just in case it was a really crappy combo. Cant find anything at all, oh well. I did walk out with 2 Storm giant thunderstick lures for 8$ a peice.  (only one left on the rack btw).  Anyhoo, if anyone knows about this combo, some info would be apreciated. Im thinking its a special one time cheapo combo that some store couldnt sell. It would be great for the kids if the quality is good. Thanks in advance"
553418,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-19 19:15:00,4399,I wouldn`t expect much for 50 bucks and the fact that you can`t find any reviews probably says something!
