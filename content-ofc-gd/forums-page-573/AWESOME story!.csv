I've been especially busy, and am usually not able to get on OFC much at this time of year but this story hit home as I'm sure it will with many.  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmaster/columns/story?columnist=barone_don&page=g_col_Barone_Classic_AngelsII  PS. KVD is KILLIN' it!  Enjoy the end of your weekends!  Ryan"

My heart goes out to him and his family, and each and every person around the world in that position."

Too often we only think of professionals as nothing more than money-making entertainment machines when what we really need are role models and real heroes.  This story shows us that we can have both. In the case it's hard to say who is the role model and who is the hero. Perhaps it's a little bit of both of them all rolled into one. Good for them both for sharing their lives, trials and successes with each other and the rest of us to give a wonderful composite hero/role model.  Thanks for telling the story, Ryan.  JF"
