540400,solopaddler,2011-01-17 12:35:00,8605,"Very cool, thanks for posting those pic's! (next time use photobucket  )  I've fished Big East a couple times in softwater and always had to work for our fish.  I've gone winter camping/ice fishing several times N/E of Whitney. There's some excellent lakes there adjacent to the park."
540413,bigugli,2011-01-17 13:20:00,6138,Good on you for having a go. It's a different experience from fair weather camping and can be quite rewarding. Used to take scouts out for winter camping. They'd have a blast.
540426,I'mHooked,2011-01-17 14:26:00,525,"Love the ""Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum"" promo shot in the 1st pic!  Looks like fun.  What did you sleep on? tarp, foam, etc."
540444,LucG,2011-01-17 15:13:00,779,Cool! Must have been a neat experience. What was the interior temp compared to the outside temp?
540503,rfmcrx,2011-01-17 17:39:00,42,"we slept on a layer of pine branches with a tarp on top of that and some airmatress.then 2 sleeping bages each. It was really warm inside the quincy and i dont knwo the exact temp, but it was cold sunday morning. I would deffinatly do it again, only this time i would leave the water in the cooler. the worst part was getting the gear to site and building the quincy. we are thinking bout going back to the spot later this winter."
540509,bubbles,2011-01-17 18:03:00,591,That is Awesome.  Looks like a blast.
540510,NAW,2011-01-17 18:09:00,4022,That looks like a wicked weekend man.  Good on ya!
540511,fishindude,2011-01-17 18:12:00,220,"Good choice with the Muskoka Cream Ale  Looks like a great trip, I might have to try building one of those for fun heh"
540677,Sinker,2011-01-18 00:45:00,8692,"I've winter camped a few times too, and in my experience, the quincy is the way to go. I froze my balls off in a tent LOL  S."
540695,bigugli,2011-01-18 01:26:00,6138,"When we took the scouts out, we needed a shelter for 12 to 15 people.  Stick frame for a roof with a black tarp on top. Black tarp for floor, overlapped at the ground. Snow piled against the side wall as high as possible to seal the shelter against wind. Straw on the  floor to insulate. Got quite comfy in there for 2 nights. A snow drift quinzy is the way to go if there are only 2-3 people."
540697,shan&jay,2011-01-18 01:32:00,55,Hey bigugli I sent you a pm. I think you where my scout leader like 15 years ago. Lol. And I remember camping just like you described. Exept my feet where freezing.
