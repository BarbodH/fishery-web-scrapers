553054,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 18:37:00,11391," A few of us have been watching all day. I even got up early enough to have coffee before things got going. So far it looks pretty interesting, and it should be a entertaining weigh in. Especially since we all know basstrakk is horribly inaccurate"
553055,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-18 18:37:00,4399,  Is that the derby in the States?
553056,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-18 18:42:00,0,  They still have thoughs?
