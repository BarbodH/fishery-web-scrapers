In honour of that, here's the Top 10 reasons why Kevin VanDam is the Chuck Norris of bass fishing ...  • Some people wear Superman pajamas. Superman wears KVD pajamas.  • KVD doesn't need to actually cast for fish, he simply goes to a river or lake and says: ""You, you, you, you and you -- in the livewell!""  • KVD can win a game of Connect Four in only three moves.  • When the boogeyman goes to sleep, he checks his closet for KVD.  • When KVD goes fishing, he doesn't need a fishing pole - he just stares at the water till the fish jump into his boat out of shear panic.  • KVD runs until the treadmill gets tired.  • They found KVD 's to-do list ... It is now known as The Guinness Book of World Records.  • KVD doesn't do push-ups.
