553450,Grimace,2011-02-19 21:27:00,2020,They are giving away a 22 foot Starcraft Islander for I think 28 grand.  Inboard 6.  Beautiful boat.  I fell in love with the Lund Tyee 1850.  All in all the show is the same as it has always been.  A good day out. I did not buy a thing except an off the docks shirt for my son. All the fishing shills were there selling the same old stuff.  Lots of walking billboards. A good day out.
553457,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-19 22:16:00,3761,"Was there today also, just took a few pictures of the boats. Good show, a first time for me. JP had a decent seminar there today. Was also nice to stop and talk to the CO's that were there, lot's of good info these guys gave me in part to my schooling etc..  Here are a few pic's          "
553486,danbouck,2011-02-20 00:30:00,4380,"I honestly thought it sucked this year. Only thing I really wanted was a new VHF radio for the boat, The guys I spoke to at radio world had no clue about them and told me to go by the store   So I hit BPS afterwards and spent my money there."
553492,Grimace,2011-02-20 01:03:00,2020,That is too bad Dan.  The guys at the store are awesome.  I Overheard a guy at the booth talking to a guy about flashers and he did not seem to know much.  I think if you stopped into the store you would gave been pleasantly surprised with the selection and knowledge.
553519,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-20 02:50:00,1622,I was there today & didn't get enough so I'm going back tomorrow just have to go to Young & Sheppard 1st to drop the wife off at my daughters SBK
553529,HTHM,2011-02-20 03:09:00,4082,"My opinion of the show, MEH. I was not to terribly impressed, and found the show to be a bit SSDY (same stuff different year) Hed fun workin Off the dock's booth though.   The one booth well worth visiting."
553557,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-20 04:23:00,1622,"BASS MAGNET WOW they have some good looking stuff, I can see some big fish being caught on their product this year for TEAM # 10 SBK"
553565,walleyejack,2011-02-20 04:37:00,358,"Was at the show from 1 to 4, like buddy says SSDY,didn t see any big deals,listened to Paul do his seminar,always good. All in all was ok, a day out."
553566,bigugli,2011-02-20 04:42:00,6138,"There wasn't much to be impressed with. Almost everyone selling the same 5-6 lines of plastics. The usual discount racks and bins. A couple of newer outfitters. Got a chuckle watching 2 wee fellas fight trout in the pond. Couple of seminars that were worthwhile. The one chef had a potato and leek walleye dish that was heavenly. Met up with HTHM, and spent some time chatting with Maureen at Off The Dock. I love the caricatures you do. Well worth the money."
553664,targaboy175,2011-02-20 16:44:00,76,"i'll be going today, 30% off on rapala rods right ? i want to grap a shift baticast rod."
553671,Whitemikeca,2011-02-20 17:29:00,138,"I was there yesterday.  I enjoyed the Pyzer, Mania, Izumi and JP seminars.  Bought up a bunch of Japanese lures from Pro J and fishing world.  I was happy to see that Dobyns rods had a presence at Pro J and Fishing world.  For those of you that don't know about Dobyns, they are sweet bass rods.  IMO more sensitive and more attractive and better balanced than G Loomis.  I have the Champion extreme 744 rod and its the best rod I have ever used for pitching jigs and platics.  Unfortunately they didnt have the model I was looking for in stock.  JBs had some good deals on muskie lures and rods.  I will be back Monday morning to see the master muskie seminar"
553740,hammercarp,2011-02-20 21:50:00,964, Hey Bruce It was good to see you there.

553120,misfish,2011-02-18 21:47:00,29133,"The show was ok,IMO.Nothing really great,prices were fair I thought."
553122,Joey,2011-02-18 21:52:00,9122,Good info here on the show B.  Would you say the prices are cheaper than just going to the store?
553123,fishnsled,2011-02-18 21:53:00,3520,"Thanks for the low down on the show. I think I'll stick to my flip up for now as well. Don't think the sled will pull that trailer to easily, looks very nice though. What boat are you looking at Brian?"
553127,ah_long,2011-02-18 21:56:00,354,"Just got back.. prices are fair for the Rods and Reels, nothing really caught my eye..  I did load up on the Kopper Live Target stuff..  I find that LeBaron has better prices especially if you have a membership...  I did find a last season's G-Loomis Soft Shell Jacket from Pro J Tackle for $80 (Reg. $150)"
553129,misfish,2011-02-18 22:03:00,29133,"There were some good deals,but sales at stores would be the same.   Lowes FM175 w/115."
553131,livinisfishin,2011-02-18 22:06:00,661,Going tomorrow with the boys from work ..thanks for the heads up!

553151,lew,2011-02-18 22:48:00,12766,"Thanks again Brian, always good hooking up with you.  I knew going down there today that I didn't need anything and that's exactly what I bought....nothing.  Always good to come home with the same amount of $$$$ I left the house with  It's a good show this year and I spent 3 hours just wandering around looking at stuff and yakking with folks I know down there.  Anyone heading there this weekend should really enjoy themselves."
553156,Kawartha Kev,2011-02-18 23:02:00,281,I was also at the show and thought I recognized a couple guys walking around including Lew and if I was not mistaken Brandon and saw a few of the OFC hats on people that I didn't recognize. As far as the show goes it was just ok nothing special and I did not find anything I really needed food and drinks are very expensive bring your own if you can.
553174,misfish,2011-02-18 23:39:00,29133, 
553206,brandon,2011-02-19 00:45:00,857,"It was nice seeing you again Brian!  Lew, I heard you were there but I couldn't find ya.  I also chatted quite a bit with Steve Rowbotham.  I'll be there wandering around all day tomorrow.  I'll be wearing shorts, a blue hoodie, and have a camera around my neck - say hi if you see me!"
553231,bigbuck,2011-02-19 02:04:00,2449,"I got caught up with work today and couldn't make it. We're off to Honey harbour for the weekend so it looks  like I'm going to miss the show. Too bad, it would have been great to have a chance to gab with Pete Maina and Gord Pyzer again."
553247,vance,2011-02-19 03:12:00,719,The guy with the OFC hat was VANCE nice to meet you misfish:thumbsup_anim:  vance
553252,BillM,2011-02-19 03:51:00,17367,"Brian, how long is the rear grip on that rod????  It looks looooong"
553268,misfish,2011-02-19 10:18:00,29133," Thats kind of a personal question aint it Bill? Not sure,I,ll measure it when I get home.LOL  Sorry Vance,I just didnt remember.Was nice to meet you."
553344,Raf,2011-02-19 14:35:00,3495,"I'm going tomorrow.  In the market for a new Lowrance, hopefully there's a deal to be found.  Was radioworld a vendor?"
553347,lew,2011-02-19 14:41:00,12766," Yup, their there Raf but I don't know what the prices were like."

553354,lew,2011-02-19 15:52:00,12766,"Hey Dann, I was in Sea Cadets about a million years ago, but the only trips we ever took back then were to row a boat around Toronto Harbour.  Boy, have times ever changed"
553419,Pikeslayer,2011-02-19 19:22:00,1443,"Dann, I probably just missed you guys. My son in law and I left the show at 11:15. Would of been nice to meet miss Kelly and see Daniel decked out in his uniform."
553424,Pikeslayer,2011-02-19 19:51:00,1443,"I gotta say, I like this show better than the sportsmen show. It's pretty much dedicated to fishing, free parking, all the vendors I care to see and good location. Left the house @ 8:45 & home by 12:45. I just picked up some odds & ends; line, terminal tackle & lowrance structure scan. I met Maureen from 'Off the Dock' and picked up a pink onesie For granddaughter Leah.  It was nice to get out and start thinking about spring.Back to the hard water tomorrow."
553429,ADB,2011-02-19 20:19:00,444,"Show was good...there were some deals to be had.  Picked up a 7'6"" MH St. Croix Mojo Bass - normally $129.99 + tax - for $110 tax-in at Tightlines.  LiveTargets were also on at one of the retailers for buy 4, get one free.  Saw Bob's seminar which was cool."
