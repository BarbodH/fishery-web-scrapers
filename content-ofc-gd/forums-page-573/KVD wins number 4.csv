553818,HTHM,2011-02-21 00:14:00,4082,"As Dave Mercer said, KVD slams the door on number 4! What a good MC he is, even without a oicture it is fun to watch/listen to."
553819,bigmac1984,2011-02-21 00:16:00,193,"He did it with a huge bag of fish too.... Shattered the record, over 69lbs.  "
553823,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-21 00:21:00,3761,"Anybody got a weigh in link with photo's to share?? Congrads to him, he's a unreal angler. I wan't to be as talented as him one day."
553824,PikeMolester,2011-02-21 00:24:00,428,http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/tournaments/classic/live/index just had the whole weigh in. and footage of him catching him on the water. maybe theyll be replaying it
553825,Terry,2011-02-21 00:25:00,14456,HE IS THE MAN
553829,lhousesoccer,2011-02-21 00:30:00,442,"KVD's the man, and Mercer was an awesome MC.  His voice was cracking near the end though!"
553833,PikeMolester,2011-02-21 00:38:00,428,"I love Mercer...but hated when hed say ""G-G-G-G GIANT BASS.....BOOM SHACKALACKA!"" like it was gonna be his phrase and they will replay his amazing call in the years to come. Tried too hard certain times and shoulda came up with something more original to yell out. Other than that he is still the best MC"
553893,lhousesoccer,2011-02-21 02:52:00,442,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I thought he would have come up with something funnier and more original.  It was getting a little much after a while.  The test will be to see if they ask Dave to MC again in the future."
553915,Garry2Rs,2011-02-21 07:21:00,1425,"I watched all the weigh-ins plus on the water up dates etc. all weekend on my computer at http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmaster/index I don't have ESPN on my TV package, but the live link was just as good. Garry2R's"
