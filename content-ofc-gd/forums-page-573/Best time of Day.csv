He wants to be out on the ice at 7:30-8:00 am as he says the bite is better first thing in the morning.. I don't think it should matter too much as I have caught good schools in late morning and mid afternoon. Opinions? thanks skdds"
553223,irishfield,2011-02-19 01:34:00,26272,Lloyd will tell you that you need to be out before the sun comes up... I'll tell you when ever you get there is fine! lol

553306,turtle,2011-02-19 13:07:00,274,For me depends on the lake and also how bright the sun is and the particular lake.  I catch perch all day long on Simcoe but do best 9-11am and 3-dark.  Although I dont fish it much Scugog is known as a dusk and dawn bite.  My cottage lake produces mid-day for lake trout but if its bright sun only dusk and dawn.  I think the weather plays a big part as time/sunlight.

The afternoon bite has been just about non-existent, but once it gets within an hour or so of dusk it's game on, pretty much non-stop.  not sure if they move in or just getting active, but they can be just as picky as the walleyes when it comes to when they want to feed."
