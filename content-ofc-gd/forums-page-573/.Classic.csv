553601,fish_fishburn,2011-02-20 13:54:00,1311,"KVD heads into the final day with almost a 4lb lead.  The guy is awesome, probably the best pro bass fisherman out there.  And has been for some time now.  Just my opinion, what do you think?"
553622,OhioFisherman,2011-02-20 14:47:00,6623," Yes, maybe the best ever, very consistent, always a threat."
553645,backbay,2011-02-20 15:32:00,773,"Here's a link to the leader board for anyone interested. The guys who made the long run south have just arrived at their spots, so hopefully, the plot will start to thicken.... My link"

552891,Gregoire,2011-02-18 04:19:00,1397,That is pretty good. The fact that Klein took him seriously is golden.
552898,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-18 04:27:00,4399,who`s Gary klein and it is a fishing derby is it not? just like the Kentucky Derby is still a horse race!
552899,Gregoire,2011-02-18 04:42:00,1397,I think it's funny because Mercer is responding to a question and being entertaining and then this serious pro bass angler comes on and bashes him. Get over yourself.

552960,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 14:05:00,11391,I'm watching the live feed right now. Daves got some good interviews going on during the fog delay. He's an awesome MC to have  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/tournaments/classic/live/index
552965,Lunkerhunter,2011-02-18 14:17:00,455,just watched him doing some intro's lakeside and i must say he sounds good.
552966,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 14:22:00,11391," Yep, I agree. I'd still rather see him fish in the ""derby"" though, haha"
553019,mercman,2011-02-18 16:31:00,7054,He's a step up for sure. He brings a wealth of knowledge and a unique style to the job.
553025,HTHM,2011-02-18 16:51:00,4082,"I cannot get clear video at that site, Anyone know why? All I get is pixels that represent the image outline."
553028,mercman,2011-02-18 17:05:00,7054,  mine works fine Albert Did ya pay your pixel taxes on time

553032,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 17:20:00,11391,"Iaconelli with 14lbs, lol  I had to laugh at his interview or blog post that said he had about 10-12 bites in an hour of practice fishing, then Dave interviews him and it turns into 15 bites in an hour"
553034,lhousesoccer,2011-02-18 17:25:00,442,.
553036,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 17:27:00,11391," I like Ike as well, but his exaggerating always leaves me laughing.  Thats cool to have a friend fishing the biggest tourny of the year. Hopefully he does good"

553042,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 17:47:00,11391,"Martens has figured something out, hes on the fish big time. Damn that must be exciting in a big tourny like that.  I can't see Ike weighing in over 16-17lbs today, but he'll be in decent position if he can cull a few"
553143,d_paluch,2011-02-18 22:25:00,343,weigh-ins starting in a few!
553144,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 22:26:00,11391," yep, right when i have to take my son to hockey, of course"
553182,bigmac1984,2011-02-18 23:52:00,193,"watching right now online, Dave is doing a good job."

553421,PikeMolester,2011-02-19 19:31:00,428,I sent BASS a picture on their facebook and I'm going to be on the big screen at the Classic today. yay!
553423,backbay,2011-02-19 19:46:00,773,"I have to say the live videos and leaderboard have completely sucked me in. It's interesting to see how strategies have played out, some guys going for quality, some guys going for quantity. And yes, Mr. Klein should find or borrow a sense of humour...."
553436,EC1,2011-02-19 20:45:00,930,"It's been really good that I get to read some pretty detailed stuff about the Classic this year. I remember last year it was just Dave doing his FYI at the end of it all and I had my numbers in the Fantasy fishing, (which I did pretty terribly on).  It's pretty amazing everything is updated super fast too! Watched some of the weigh in yesterday. Probably will watch some more of it today since I won't be fishing this weekend."
553542,iankrzyzanowski,2011-02-20 03:30:00,20,"I think Mercer is doing a great job, but how about KVD... moving back up to where he belongs.."
