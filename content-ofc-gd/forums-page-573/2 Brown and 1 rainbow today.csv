553881,bassfighter,2011-02-21 02:08:00,366,"Finally able to find the right time to fish after 3 months of hibernation  Weather temp = -7 degrees than got warm to -2 Wind = 10km NE Water clarity = 4ft Crowd = at least 25 people fishing, fish were landed all over. No. of hours fishing = 7 hours.  Can't find a better day fishing during winter months.  Witness at least 15-20 fish landed the whole day.  Landed 2 Brown and one steelhead. Rainbow was kind of black and skinny. One of the brown trout was so pregnant, ready to explode at any time. I release them of course.  Lure used were a pink 3/4 oz jighead with pink hair(half streamer like), landed two fish with it, then lost it after it got snagged. One rainbow was landed using a white 4"" mr. twister grub. Fish were 5-7 lber average  Lost the Rainbow picture, coz' battery was too weak. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/fish2-1.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0002-3.jpg A bonus Dog fish on sale picture I took from a chinese food market, http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/dogfishsale.jpg"
