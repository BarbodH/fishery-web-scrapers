552933,Muskieman,2011-02-18 12:23:00,2472,The Excursion 3/4 ton Diesel is basically a F-250.... good machines..a few friends of mine have them... way better than a comparable Suburban.  I've had an Expedition @260000K(F-150 5.4) for the past 8 years and have had ZERO problems with her... regular maintenance is key.  Randy
