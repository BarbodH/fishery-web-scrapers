552223,craigdritchie,2011-02-16 20:14:00,1586,Nothing puts me to sleep faster than a TV fishing show. How on earth do guys spend all Saturday morning watching these things? Honestly - I'd rather have a barbed wire enema.
552230,solopaddler,2011-02-16 20:21:00,8605,"  That put a nasty picture in my mind, but I do agree.  Personally I was thinking having my nose hairs pulled out with pliers would be more entertaining."
552231,ehg,2011-02-16 20:31:00,2666,Haven't watched a fishing show for a decade or so. Did like Bob Izumi's show and Pete Bowman on Fish 'n Canada. Always liked Bob Mehsikomer nailing big muskies on Jackpots on Simply Fishing. Maybe if i have time on Saturday morning will check out to see if any aren't like an infomercial.
552244,lew,2011-02-16 21:06:00,12766, You'll probably be outta luck Eric.

552317,craigdritchie,2011-02-16 23:33:00,1586,"All-time favourite line from a Saturday morning fishing show:  ""And of course one of the key reasons we're catching these lake trout today is .... my dependable Fram oil filter.""  Takes 'jackass' to a whole new level."
552327,solopaddler,2011-02-16 23:56:00,8605,"I'm not a fan of Italos, but did any of you guys ever see the episode where he fished with an absolutely hammered Eddie Shack in the NWT for lakers?  I hate fishing shows but that was freaking hilarious.  ""Italo, where's my scotch?!!!""  ""I'm not sure Eddie, you just had it a second ago""   ""Whoa, this fish is HUGE!!

Wish it would come back to TV. Kept trying to win the lure pack each week but never had any luck. Now that was a fishing show the average guy could relate to."

552533,charlesn,2011-02-17 14:46:00,551,"Just got WFN again after a long absense as it wasn't offered by my provider (Bell IP-TV).  They still don't provide the HD feed which is kinda dumb since I think they offer it for their non IP-TV customers.  I DVR the following: Big Bass Battle, Classic Patterns, Scott Martin Challenge, Hook n'Look, Getting School'd, Skeeter BassChamps, PTTS, Collegiate Bass Championships, FoF and Lost Lake.  As you can tell, I prefer a certain species of fish.  lol  The DVR makes ALLLLL the difference in the world.  No mighty bite commercials, or other incredibly cheesy commercials.  For the shows themselves, I can skip the parts that I don't wanna watch.  I can rewind the parts I find interesting.  I'd take that barbed wire enema before I'd go ice fishing so I find this to be a very relaxing way to spend a couple hours a week when I have mastery of the remote.  Saturday morning I don't have any tv control, so usually it's Caillou and Wonder Pets.  I used to enjoy the occasional Lunkerville and Fishomania and of course FLW Outdoors for anything but king fish.  But they don't seem to be on any more.  I don't try to ""learn"" anything from any of these shows.  I'm just turning the brain off and being entertained by people doing something I love since I'm at home on the couch.  I find it amusing how some people are so critical about a fishing tv show.  Have you seen what garbage and filth is on the toob these days.  At least I can watch these shows and not have to be worried my kids are going to come by and see a dead body or young people sexing.  I think the critics should relax a little or if they truly think they can do better - go do it.  Nothing is stopping you from going for it other than excuses and fear of failure.  Charles"

551348,lew,2011-02-14 11:35:00,12766," Thanks Chris, that's the lady I was thinking of. She had a   pretty decent show for a couple years.  Way back in my foggy memory I seem I remember she was somehow caught up in all that trouble with Henry & Italo, but hopefully I'm wrong on that one."
551350,solopaddler,2011-02-14 11:40:00,8605," Nope. She was an employee of Canadian Sportfishing and her show was created and produced by Italo.  As was there hunting show, Outdoor Sportsman with Dave Kraisosky."

551360,solopaddler,2011-02-14 13:04:00,8605, Well actually all of their other shows were swept to the wayside after their troubles with the law.
551364,bigugli,2011-02-14 13:18:00,6138,"I'm sorry, but there is only one great Canadian fishing show. Some have come close, but none equal Red Fisher and his tales.  I realize half the folks on this board weren't even a twinkle in their father's eyes when his show ran, but it featured not just the fishing but the great outdoors as a whole."
551387,Headhunter,2011-02-14 15:06:00,5703,"I have to agree with this ^ And I'd probably pay to watch the show again, if they removed that background music and allowed us to hear what was actually said during the filming. Having met ""Red"" a couple of times, I would guess that a show like that would probably be sequestered to late night viewing! Language would have been colourful to say the least! HH"
551420,Spiel,2011-02-14 16:35:00,9065," I'm old enough to remember watching Red with my father and grandfather, is was a Sunday afternoon ritual for years. Worst fishing show ever IMHO, couldn't stand it...."

Why use one word when 30 is more? From the Wolf Blitzer school of Verbal Diarrhea.  Big City Fishing - Jamies' fine, it is just the Girl who appears totally out of her element.  I wonder if that is Executive Producer Henry Waszczuk's Hire.  Getting schooled (J.P.'s) - The seemingly endless filler on this show(""Lets check out Icast""...ten minutes later...Icast, ""Lets take it to the water""...ten minutes later...actual fishing, repeat, repeat, repeat.  Cheers, Mark"
551442,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-14 17:02:00,0,If I had to pick one it would be the Linders et al because they always seemed to lead the industry in cutting edges techniques for ALL species of fish.  The rest of the pack are just talking heads for their sponsors who spend 99% of their airtime bass angling.
551447,Harrison,2011-02-14 17:10:00,2202,"Stay Tooned...  100% fishing (sure we want to learn new things, but we also want to be multi-species entertained).  If you want details on the how, where and with what... you can go to the website if you choose.  All in the works.  But, I vote for the Linders for best ever.. simply because they are multi-species and do most of it on their own."
551460,Court R,2011-02-14 17:34:00,213,Here's a new show coming out this spring.  
551482,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-14 18:42:00,10439,  You got that right!!!! I wish it was still running. I blame Red for me living where I do. If it wasn't for Red doing all those awesome shows about Great Bear Lake and all of his other great locations I might not even be into fishing. Darn you Red!!!! You cost me a freaking fortune!!!!!!
551488,Billy Bob,2011-02-14 19:05:00,5865, Red Fisher like his booze... ... that's why he always had those binoculars with him...it was his flask.......he showed everyone on his last show how the eye lense screwed off and he drank from them.

551499,JoshS,2011-02-14 19:33:00,729,"I catch myself watching shows like the Next bite, Musky hunter, simply fishing, lost lake, linders fishing edge, extreme angler. If you can look past the endorsements, I like these kind of shows better than others because they seem to concentrate more on technique and patterns. I like the tourny shows too besides that guy that commentates and does those hardcore Berkley plugs, I don't think it gets worse then him.. ""just tie-on your berkley flikr shad people, throw it out there and if there's fish in the lake, you will catch them folks, a lot of them, and have a GREAT day fishing. Make sure you get a bunch of colours to try and see whats working to maximize your time on the water, increase your chances to win BIG money and have a great day on the water"". I know from first hand knowledge Bob Izumi is a great guy and I'm proud he's been in the spotlight for so many years. Can't stand Fish TV or Italo's show. Mercer throws one endorsed product all show and the show is seriously lacking the technical side but is a good guy to promote the industry to newcomers. The more technical shows get the nod for sure."
551518,Whitemikeca,2011-02-14 20:14:00,138,"Like most other people, I tend to enjoy the shows that focus on technical aspects and teach rather than shows that just show fish being caught(often with the help of a guide) but offer no redeeming knowledge.  My favs are:  Linders et al - IMO the best, most informative fishing shows ever made.  I am not a religious man so the last segment doesn't interest me much, but the rest of it is the most polished, informative fishing show currently on the air.  Lost Lake - I enjoy seeing the pros breakdown a new body of water.  The Next Bite - The walleye shows are really good but the Musky episodes are amazing.  Musky Hunter - Great tips and info.  I am hoping to attend Musky University one of these years  Real Fishing w/ Bob Izumi - Not as informative as the shows on my list but I have been watching Bob since I was a kid and he really is the greatest ambassador for fishing in Canada.  Classic Patterns - Good technique specific knowledge.

551712,NAC,2011-02-15 11:34:00,369,  looks decent but I'll probably not watch someone get so enthusiastic over 4-10lb fish.  Looks like he'll be promoting the blue zone.   fav show would have to be Gillznfinz but fav Canadian show would likely be Big Coast.

551826,Familyfisherman,2011-02-15 21:11:00,188,"Similar to others -- I like the Lindners Fishing Edge and In Fisherman shows.  I also enjoy some of the Canadian shows -- Fishfull Thinking, Fishin Canada, Bob, and Canadian Sportfishing.  However, the Lindners get much more indepth with their techniques and specifics...Charlie does more than some of the others also.  On the negative side -- I like Extreme Angler at times, but I really enjoy Mark Kulic, and he isn't on much anymore.  Also, I find the cameras change around way too much...hard to watch.  I don't like Going fishing...very limited techniques...I get bored watching people catch 1.5lb walleye one after the other on their free trip up north.  Not a big salt water fan...my 2 cents."

552146,torco,2011-02-16 16:21:00,656,I like the new fly fisher with bill spicer or some of the other hosts. I learn a tonne in each episode and if its an episode on an area of water i plan to fish in the near future i save it on the pvr so i can review it again. Maybe its cause i am new to fly fishing and still suck but they break it down nicely. Like flymax for the pure fishing aspect.

Babe was always there with what looked like 2 hookers, one under each arm as he left the one night....my cousin said, ""look for Herpes sores on the mouth during his next show...  This new wife Chris is..........errrrr not good looking at ALL....  I remember Charlie coming to Buffalo to sign her cook book and all the guys were drewling over her as she was wearing a slimsly white low cut blouse while the twins were poking out."

Real fishing is great because Bob is the man. Any saltwater fishing shows are great.  George Palmerano catches big fish. Linders are great. I even like those crazy Aussie shows where they randomly catch weird fish.

Shows like Sportfishing BC, Fishing WA, Alaska Outdoors (kinda biased on this one    ), I also like to watch Adventures North. I can still watch Bob and the Linders, but what gets turned off immediately are any shows that have anything to do with bass!!! Don't have 'em up here and don't care if I ever fish 'em again. That putz Italo gets totally ignored and I won't even look to see what is on his show."

Facts of fishing, Jp Derose, Fish'n'Canada,Next bite, Musky hunter, Lindners angling edge,Lost lake ( it be alot better if it be a multi-species show tho not just bass ) , Real fishing, Canadian Sportsfishing and Big city fishing gets my attention also... There's one thing that bothers me tho when I watch a fishing show is that when you start watching a show and they start saying our guide, our guide, our guide.... blah blah   I never used a guide... Don't wanna use one unless I would get invited by friends on a big charter or something, because it wouldnt be my fish it would be somebody else bringing us there wich in my book isnt called fishing, and I would definitely not take a guide to make a fishing show?? What does this say about the show? That the host can't find fish?   Shows would be alot more interesting if they wouldn't use guides at all... If I'm watching a fishing show and they keep talking about our guide, our guide blah blah  I ussually change channels Because it might as well be the Guide's fishing show not the hosts The fun is finding the fish , it's not interessting if the host keeps talking about the spots they found and they have a guide  haha Find your fish !

The Next Bite is a close second, good hardcore fishing, nice explanations etc, plus good personalities. And Daves Fact of Fishing, for the personality, good action and pretty good explanations. Although I think there is too much advertising taking away from the action.  I also like Scott Martin Challenge, just because I find it interesting. Same with Lost Lake.  What are your favorites and why? Maybe I can find some good shows to watch on a non fishing day"
550792,Gregoire,2011-02-12 19:36:00,1397,"Anything musky related. I like the next bite as the info giving on the show is good and Pete Maina is a genius. The musky hunter is good, I've only been watching it regularly this year and wish he didn't cast so much. My wrists and arms hurt just watching the show. Facts of fishing is awesome as Dave Mercer is the best fishing personality on TV IMHO. I have a soft spot for Bob Izumi, as this was the only show that was regularly on TV when I was a kid. I also have heard that he is a great guy to fish with (although not owning a boat I have found that anyone willing to take you out in his boat is a great guy to fish with). Fishing edge is a good show, but I find the last little bit with Al Linder to be a little different."

550869,Billy Bob,2011-02-12 22:54:00,5865,"I have In-Fishermen Shows taped that are 1 hour each from the late 80's....I would say 50 shows in all, maybe more......they are PACKED with info..  Now his Linder Angle Edge Show is pretty good....in 30 minutes you get 15 minutes or LESS in real content.  Also The In-Fishermen Show that the Linders sold is pretty good....but again 15 minutes or LESS in content......  All the rest I don't even bother with."
550874,Terry,2011-02-12 23:01:00,14456,Linders Fishing Edge   infishermen   the next bite...but I have not seen it on WFN lately...note to self..search for it..  Dave's OK too
