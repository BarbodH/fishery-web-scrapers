553594,mercman,2011-02-20 13:29:00,7054,Glad to se ya back home !!! Do they sell that stuff in 6 packs
553599,Billy Bob,2011-02-20 13:52:00,5865,"In the USA where the health care professionals are much better you would have been home the same day......OH WAIT, that's because the insurance wouldn't pay for a overnight stay....LOL  Now if they gave you any pain pills the trick is don't take them all now, save some for when you're all better...LOL  Get Well SOON, Bob"
553600,jedimaster,2011-02-20 13:53:00,3472,"Do you want the stephen king pills or the Meagon fox pills? Haha. When I told pharmacist about why I changeD my meds she was horrified and called the other lady over to hear the stories. A few other patrons were also listening, two patrons put down on there med records they don't want those oxycodone's. I know other people that have taken them without issue, but it seems a small percentage of people have some bad times on them. Eitherway The moral of the story is if you get meds and have issues talk to your doc they hot all the good stuff tucked away.  I am not sure of the name of these but they are a mix of cafffiene, Asa, codeine and barbiturate.  Might be a mix of redbull and cialis for all I know. Haha  Funny thing is I am a light sleep tossing and turning and I fell asleep and didn't budge all night my fiance told me she woke up and check to make sure I was breathing twice."
553636,Oggie,2011-02-20 15:12:00,588,Sounds like you caught it just in time!  Get well quickly and take it easy as you start to feel better. It's tempting to do too much at first.  At least you still have your sense of humour!  Dan O.
553638,ChrisK,2011-02-20 15:17:00,2772,Good to here your home and getting better
553641,Leecher,2011-02-20 15:23:00,7832,"Glad to hear your on the mend Jedi Like others said, take her easy."
552066,jedimaster,2011-02-16 10:29:00,3472,"Well I have been in the hospital for 3 days now, my appendix apparently was dead for some time now and it got gangrene. Now I am on a steady iv of antibiotics, morphine, jello and sponge baths.  To anyone that has had this surgery done I feel for yah.. To anyone that hasnt don't ignore stomach pains. Go get it checked out. I thought it was just a stomach bug for a few days until it turned really painful. To the point wherei could barely drive, stand sit or walk. So I got my ass dragged into rhe emerg and within 30 minutes of being seen by a doctor I was out cold with my guts hanging out... If i caught it earlier I woulda likely been out already. Now I am just praying I can fart.  3 days and counting of jello and chicken broth is not sittin well with me.  Have a good one folks and make sure you don't ignore barfing mixed with severe stomach pains.  QOD  ""would you like to wash yourself up or shall I have some nurses give you a sponge bath""  ummm is that serious question?"
552067,Terry,2011-02-16 10:35:00,14456,"aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sponge baths.....  man that sucks  hope you get on solid food soon"
552068,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-16 10:38:00,2582,Take it easy and you will be 100% well before you get the yak out on the water again  I tell you it's crazy what some people will do just to get a woman to give them a nice sponge bath  Be well
552069,Roy,2011-02-16 10:41:00,13728,Sounds really painful. Is the recovery long or will you be ok pretty well once the ABs have done their job? Maybe you can get someone to sneak you in some bacon wrapped pickerel nuggets and maybe even a beer to wash'em down!
552070,misfish,2011-02-16 11:13:00,29133,Now yer talking Roy.  Good thing you got yerself in. Could of spread and been worse.Speedy recovery Jed.
552071,jedimaster,2011-02-16 11:33:00,3472,"yah was lucky it didn't burst, the guy in the bed across from me had his burst, they are cleaning out his wounds hourly. The infection was pretty bad though so i gotta stay on the iv antibiotics for a while i think. i am hoping to get some solid food. I would kill for a nicely breaded fried in butter walleye fillet right about now. I think it takes a few months before ou fully regain your ab strength. Even thought they ony did they puncture three holes thing my abs are pretty sore."
552075,BUSTER,2011-02-16 11:54:00,1336,What hospital and rm# I will swing by with a burger and fries for ya get well

552131,mercman,2011-02-16 15:17:00,7054," Bummer Jed !!!if ya want to have some fun, put apple juice in the specimen cup next time they need a sample. Take it from me, that will get the buz goin at the nurses station  Get will soon !!!!"
552134,ranksda58,2011-02-16 15:30:00,69,"i feel for ya jedi...a few years ago, i was having ridiculous stomach pains but kept putting it off as indigestion...finally one day my parents convinced me to go to emerg. i was admitted immediately as they realized after an ultra sound that my gall bladder was full of stones. spent a week on nothing but IV fluids (no solid food, no water, no nothing) to get the swelling down, then had surgery...they tried the easy little laser surgery, but my gallbladder was so full of stones that it was like a hackey sack and they were scared if they tried to pull it out through the 2 inch hole they made that it would burst...and if that happened i wouldnt be typing this today i guess. now i have a 13 inch scar across my stomach and a great conversation starter with the ladies lol  i hope you feel better, enjoy the the jello, nurses and morphine now, because when you get home you`re going to have a heck of a time moving around. get well soon!"
552136,Nemo,2011-02-16 15:45:00,727,Been there done that. Try not to cough too hard it is painful. Double up on the morphine it is truly delicious.  Get well soon.  Nemo
552149,jedimaster,2011-02-16 16:32:00,3472,saved up a scoop of green jello and put it on my stomach when the nurse came in to check me she almost fainted... haha she got me back though it a needle to the stomach
552233,Terry,2011-02-16 20:38:00,14456,hey my wife is a nurse there I will tell her to put a little something extra in your next shot.....
552282,jedimaster,2011-02-16 22:27:00,3472,Yah hook me up.  I am sure they got a secret stash somewhere. What floor does she work on?
552289,Blue Lk,2011-02-16 22:33:00,337,"Get well soon. DO NOT let them give you a suppository,you may as well shove 1 up your butt for all the good it will do ya"

552514,jedimaster,2011-02-17 14:20:00,3472,"Well I have been upgraded to eating this white paste type stuff, had a fever last night, so i think i'll be in for a bit longer. its nice to have something go in my stomach. Thanks for all the comments guys, its so boring here."
553593,jedimaster,2011-02-20 13:22:00,3472,"Well it's been an interesting two days. I am at home now. Was released on Thursday afternoon. I got put on some oxy's for pain and a couple of antibiotics and sent packing. Thanks to everyone for the chat and the well wishes. I am still in pain but I tell yah the pills they gave me have not gone down well. I started off haluncinating a bit seeing things running around the walls. Then when I tried to sleep I had crazy dreams like out of a stephen king movie. Haven't slept since I was in the hospital. Then yeaterday I went to the doc office and got switched some different meds and I slept last night without issue. Actually my dreams were ""happy"" dreams all night   haha sleeping while on the drugs has been an interesting experience. It's nice to be sleeping again and nice to not be afraid to take the pain meds. If you get prescribed oxycodone or percocet and have bad dreams it's common and they can switch to something else. I have only good things to say about the folks at Newmarket hospital.  And thanks to everyone that wished me well. With ice fishing in the bag for me I am looking forward to the annual spring brookie trip."
