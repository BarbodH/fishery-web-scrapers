454315,Syn,2010-04-10 16:23:00,519,Ha that grunting video was interesting. Wonder if the worms would come up if your car woofer box face down on the grass and played some heavy metal?
454320,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-10 16:31:00,0,You can use Hot powdered mustard. Mix some up in a pale of water and pour a little down each hole.  It only takes seconds for the worm to come flying out it's hole. Wash it off in water and toss it in your worm bucket. You don't have to hunt at nigh or do you have to wait until it rains. Hope that helps.   ps...I wouldnt try the electric rod in the ground  trick.

454419,newboykool,2010-04-10 21:58:00,81,go to a soccer field at night after a rainy day
454431,fshrgy99,2010-04-10 22:48:00,9," Keep them in the fridge, loose soil or (if you want to spend $$) look for worm soil at CTC. Keep them pretty dry and they'll last 4 ever. Too wet and you don't want to open them in the house! Check them once in a while and add a few drops of water to keep them plump. I've got some that have lasted all winter next to my spool of Sufix (my wife stays away from that shelf    )  I check early after a good night of rain on walkways drives etc. ... picked up 40 the other morning (before the robins got them) and put most of them on my backyard lawn for future harvesting. My wife called me a worm poacher!"
454451,Mykester,2010-04-10 23:43:00,241,What is CTC? Canadian Tire Corporation?

454478,irishfield,2010-04-11 00:54:00,26272,Was a good movie in it's day... All because of electro shocking worms...
454486,LimbLifter,2010-04-11 01:25:00,27,"Does anybody remember the small tablets called Worm-Up.  You put them in the bottom of a bucket, put the hose in the bucket, and let the water overflow.  You would have worms come up everywhere...big and small.  it was an amazing product...just cant find it anymore."
454499,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-11 02:02:00,0,  scary worms....  make sure you only put the HOT WIRE in the ground after you wet it and don't walk around with the power on....ya it works well.
454503,Mykester,2010-04-11 02:07:00,241," I suppose you can get a solution of something that worms hate, kind of how a post here suggests to mix mustard powder with water."
454671,ch312,2010-04-11 15:14:00,1590,baseball and soccer fields are prime locations. you can also make any backyard a prime location by releasing leftover worms from fishing trips. my dad has been doing this for a long time and now the yard is littered with worms every night there is rain.  i like to go bare foot because it makes it much easier to walk silently and to avoid vibrations. you'd be surprised by how many more worms you will see if you tread very lightly. i also stretch a red balloon over my light to avoid spooking them. also makes it easier for you to see in the dark as the red doesnt effect your night vision.
453937,Mykester,2010-04-09 20:38:00,241,"Where should I focus my search on, as in beside trees where the soil is softer, or what (I don't have a backyard)."
453938,misfish,2010-04-09 20:43:00,29133," Baseball fields,soccer pitches."
453940,Mykester,2010-04-09 20:56:00,241," This will work. Do they just randomly come out at random places of the field, or would they congregate around the poles, trees, etc?"
453942,TC1OZ,2010-04-09 21:02:00,987,At my work after a long rain they all seem to head for the parking lot!
453943,irishfield,2010-04-09 21:03:00,26272,"Some will look at you strange doing it.. but you can ""grunt"" them to the surface as well. Google it...  Or the old electro trick.."
453950,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-09 21:30:00,10439,I used to hit up the baseball fields and the easiest pickin' was walking the base paths. After some rain it's even better.
453951,misfish,2010-04-09 21:30:00,29133," They will be everywhere. If you have a golf course contact,that would be the best place.Thats where alot of these wholesalers get thiers."
453972,misfish,2010-04-09 22:06:00,29133,
453999,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-09 22:39:00,10439,  But don't just walk onto a golf course and start picking because you will likely be attacked by headlamp wearing wormpicking ninjas!!!! Don't ask me how I know!!!!
454007,Cudz,2010-04-09 22:54:00,2652,"Use a small flashlight, not too bright.  I use my cellphone.  Find a grass area.  THe worms actually don't often come all the way out of the ground but they come out about 3/4 of the way so you sometimes have to pull them out.  They are fast and strong believe it or not.  Here is what i do.  Find a crawler, find the dark end vs the light end (colour wise).  The lighter end is the back end so that is the direction they will try to go when you grab them.  The closer you grab to the back end the more likely you will be able to successfully pull out a crawler.  Once you grab it quickly, pull gently until the whole worm comes out of the hole.  I get about 25-30 10"" to 12"" worms every night I choose to hunt for them using this method."
454023,Mykester,2010-04-09 23:10:00,241,"Thanks. Also, will they still come out? It's 3 C right now, it will probably be a bit lower at night."
454033,The JAY,2010-04-09 23:18:00,239,"I see them every night when I take the puppy out for a pee. (His, not mine) I usually sit on the porch and watch the leaves or grass moving. You can see them 15' away. A rain make it even more prolific. I just don't know what to put them in to keep them for more than a day or two..."
454078,misfish,2010-04-10 00:10:00,29133, If you can get a styrofoam box 16x24 8 inch deep(any fish market has them)Just dig a hole about 12-18 inches into the ground and the width the size of the box.Fill the box with peat and dirt.Add worms (strips of news print soaked with water is a must aswell).Now put the box in the hole you dug and cover.They will last for weeks.Just replenich the mixture every week or so.
454089,Rizzo,2010-04-10 00:21:00,4754,"what cudz said...they are surprisingly strong and can be quite frustrating if you don't grab them as close to the light end as possible. When  I first tried it in my yard last year the dang worms were close to 10 inches long! I couldn't believe part of them was still buried when they manged to pull out of my fingers and get away. Now I ""pin"" the light end to the ground and then get a real good grip on the rest of the worm that is still exposed."
454102,Muskieman,2010-04-10 00:46:00,2472,"EH!  I've tried ""grunting"" with a 2x4 and a 2x6 with some success... Electrifying the grass with a battery and coathangers works as well but seems to decrease the worms life.. Given your circumstance with no lawn to pick... I'd go to the nearest cemetery after a rain or the neighbors flower garden... look around house foundations..or ball fields... you can keep hundreds of them in the shade in a cooler with damp newspaper, sod and coffee grounds... they'll last forever.  Also when you attempt to grab the worm .. aim for the hole rather than the worm, try not to shine your light directly on the worm. It won't get spooked.. tread lightly and you'll have success.  GOOD LUCK!  RFS "

The best tip i've seen is in this thread so far is to not use a flashlight that is too bright, they are sensitive to intense light."
454141,Mykester,2010-04-10 01:52:00,241,Man either the worms weren't out or I just suck at this.

454148,The JAY,2010-04-10 02:08:00,239,"Probably a little chilly tonight. It's best after an evening shower. As a kid, I used to water the lawn after dinner, then go picking after sundown. Never failed."
454165,Mykester,2010-04-10 02:37:00,241,"Well it started snowing while I was out so I'm guessing it was a bit chilly. I'll just wait til the next shower, or go look by the river."
454221,kickingfrog,2010-04-10 11:31:00,8333,"I use a head lamp to keep both hands free. Some people will use 2 coffee cans tied to their legs so that both hands are free as well. I remember reading any article about crawler picking in a fishing magazine that mentioned using a sheet of red cellophane over your light so that the worms would not ""scare"" as easy. I never tried it though.  Careful with the ""electro shock"" the same article mentioned some sap who killed himself doing it."
454226,Big Cliff,2010-04-10 11:57:00,6899,"use sawdust on your hands, you will find that after picking a couple of worms your hands will be wet and the worms slip through your fingers, I just take a small can of sawdust and dip mu fingers in it as I am picking worms, you will find it really helps.  As for keeping them. Go to CTC or somewhere and get a bag of compost, I keep a box of worms in the fridge and they will last for several weeks. I use a styrofoam worm flat about 16"" X 16"" X 4"" deep and you can keep 4-500 worms in there no problem (I disconected the light kill switch on the fridge so the light stays on all the time) and you don't even have to put a cover on the box.  The other alternative is go and buy some from a wholesaler $30.00 for 500 last time I checked. Sure beats getting a sore back!"
