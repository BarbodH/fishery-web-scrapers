Well we tried all the regular stuff---marked a few---no go (Jiggin, trollin spoons etc.)  About an hour before pullin the pin time --I moved us deeper---bingo----60 fow bingo---I'm thinkin they had'nt moved up yet.  Anyway we did'nt need any more than this one.  Bushart  "

454851,Minnow,2010-04-12 01:21:00,177,"That laker is a Tank! Congrats, I went out for lakers today in Haliburton and got skunked. I was flat lining rapala taildancer, and other spoons and nothing, do you need downriggers to catch lake trout?"
454926,Carp,2010-04-12 05:43:00,1488,Sweet fish !!!  Congrats and thanks for sharing.
454954,bushart,2010-04-12 11:19:00,2628,  No to downriggers---I've caught a lot of lakers in my day without one---I'm not saying they don't have their place though.  Electronics plays a big role (Again)---try to sit on top of them and jig them when they're deeper----you may miss some middle fish---but at times you can reel and jig all the way to surface--slowly.  I was in the same geographic locale as you yesterday---(Central Ontario)---it was kinda tough
