454925,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-12 05:41:00,1107,just picked up my new to me boat she's old but doesn't show her age    
454927,SlowPoke,2010-04-12 05:51:00,2984," Congrats! Nice big dance floor in those, even with the engine housing. Pick up a kicker, it'll save you a ton of cash at the pumps."
454928,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-12 06:03:00,1107,"ya I'm thinking the kicker will be a off season purchase cause I will mostly be fishing pike and bass out of it this year proly only make it out trolling a couple times she come with riggers and rods,boards and dipsies now I just have to figure out how to use them LOL gotta put a new feul filter in and get it serviced before she hits the water but I'm sure I will like it and the wife and kid will be alot safer ."
454934,SlowPoke,2010-04-12 09:55:00,2984, When the walleye and bows make their way to Pt Burwell/Bruce give me a shout and I'll give you a crash course on trolling. Maybe we can put some numbers up for the team!

455052,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-12 16:34:00,1107, I will do that its a couple months still and I will have tried the riggers for pike out at bluffs bar  by then. I know quite a few guys around here so I will know where they are. And hopefully I will be able to get some fish entered soon if I don't get out I'm gonna go nuts. Thanks Dan B if ya see me on the bay come say hi.
455054,dave524,2010-04-12 16:37:00,4508,"Very Nice  ran the same hull a lot of years with a ""Sylvan"" label on it, good hull a little narrower than most current offerings in the 18.5 size but deeper which I liked when setting riggers and such. Console is way to the front maximizing cockpit space , you got a winner there."

455350,SlowPoke,2010-04-13 09:22:00,2984,"Have you considered vinyl flooring? I was able to match my original Starcraft flooring EXACTLY through Home Depot. They sell it as decking vinyl. If I recall correctly, it's $12/running foot at 6 feet wide. I can drop a sample in the mail to you and save you a trip to HD if you're interested. Or, if you're ever in London, drop in!"
455378,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-13 12:05:00,1107,I will check that out I was looking for the the stuff they put in new boats but no one carries it and the marinas I called can't even get it.
