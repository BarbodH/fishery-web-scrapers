455307,Muskieman,2010-04-13 02:16:00,2472,I just got back from looking for Smelts in the Sturgeon River..  .  WOW!!!!   Never have I seen Smelts like that!!!!  Wave on Wave.... and it's still very early... ! could imagine what it will look like later.  One would be able to fill a 5 gallon pain in minutes.  Not so many Walleye though ... seen about 7 of 'em.  Sturgeon River is Sanctuary... 'til opener.  With the abundance of these little fish they could let us fish for 'em.  Now this terrible picture doesn't do it any justice.... taken with a HP Photosmart M537  6MgP camera.   Randy
