454843,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-12 01:13:00,10439,Was watching kayak fishing on WFN this evening and saw some pretty extreme fishing. During fishing this movie one of the group of 3 kayakers hooks up on about a 250# blue marlin and while the other 2 are trying to catch up one hooks up on a striped marlin. By the time they land the smaller marlin the first guy is a speck on the horizon and they have to chase him down in the camera boat. After an epic 5 hour battle buddy ends up breaking off!!!  Here's the movies site: Movie site w trailer  And a good review with pics: Review
