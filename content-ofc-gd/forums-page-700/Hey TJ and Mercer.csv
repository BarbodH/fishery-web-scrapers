454522,radar,2010-04-11 02:28:00,138,Fantastic!
454523,irishfield,2010-04-11 02:28:00,26272,.... a little there on our left cheek Rob !!  Nice fish !! Looks like you're making out okay down there in the South..  Maybe you should try chumming the water next time we're out for Muskie !
454526,raptorfan,2010-04-11 02:34:00,126,"Nice fish man, good trip I take it?"

454531,misfish,2010-04-11 02:40:00,29133,Real nice fish there Rob.
454539,Ron,2010-04-11 02:53:00,1683,Looks like an awesome trip Rob.
454541,JPD,2010-04-11 02:55:00,296,"Congrats, beauty fish there. Don't feel bad about the puking, I did it down South as well and I'm used to fishing 6 footers on Erie all the time. The smell of the diesel combined with the motion is enough to make most sick."
454564,Joey,2010-04-11 04:30:00,9122,Beauty Fish Rob.  Looks like you're having a good time.  Keep the fish posts coming  Joey
454575,Cudz,2010-04-11 06:26:00,2652,Way to go Rob!  That is a sweet fish! Looks like a sailfish.  Nice.
454585,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-11 10:49:00,1362,Nice looking fish!....the water looks gorgeous!
454657,steverowbotham,2010-04-11 14:45:00,1800,im jealous
455056,kickingfrog,2010-04-12 16:44:00,8333,"Thanks guys.  The sea is a much different beast then anythings else I've experienced. Big, horizon covering swells and wind/waves blowing diagonally across the swells made me feel like I was bobbing on a cork.  Now that I'm back I'll post some photos from the resort as well."
455059,anders,2010-04-12 17:02:00,1168,thats a solid fish!
455060,fish-miester,2010-04-12 17:02:00,864,saaweeeett!
455064,NAW,2010-04-12 17:07:00,4022,Nice fish man.  Definitly worth the two pukes!  I've never been sea sick in Canada.  But I puke everytime I go out in the Bahamas.. Weird..
455072,Spiel,2010-04-12 17:26:00,9065,I don't see any blood Rob. Damn fish might be in the way though.
455121,kickingfrog,2010-04-12 19:39:00,8333, The fish is covering the puke as well. At least I didn't get any in my hair.
455134,glen,2010-04-12 20:24:00,2641,Nice fish Rob.
