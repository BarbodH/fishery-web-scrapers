453962,smitter,2010-04-09 21:56:00,106,"You are going at a really good time. Lots of the rivers in that area have a steelhead run of some kind, although the water level is very low this year. My suggestion, as you drive up hwy 17, you will see rivers, and you will see cars parked by the side of the road, they're not parked there to go bird watching. Those cars are your indicator that there is good fishing to be had in that trib.  If you feel like going for a bit of a walk, shoot me a pm and I'll tell you where one of my favorite holes is."
