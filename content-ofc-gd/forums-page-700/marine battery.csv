452723,babaganoush,2010-04-06 20:35:00,105,looking for opinions on a good battery that will last a few years and where to get it thanks
452755,fish_fishburn,2010-04-06 22:02:00,1311,ENERGIZER at wally world. they run about 100.00 and are a real good battery. I have three of them in my bass boat and no issues going on three yrs. As a matter of fact I checked them for charge on the weekend and they are all fully charged after sitting in a garage all winter without charging.
454387,scugpg,2010-04-10 20:43:00,1373, Hey what is the warranty on the Energizer deep cycles? Parents need a battery and this sounds like the easiest and cost-effective option for where they are located.
