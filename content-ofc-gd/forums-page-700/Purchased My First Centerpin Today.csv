453744,Twocoda,2010-04-09 02:27:00,4130,Congrates Laz...your goin to love the fight ....now place the bets on whether or not he lands his first bow on the pin....if i remember correctly when you decided to play with the bows i bet against you landing your first hook up.....but you did .....so ...im going to say ...you will land the first on the pin....hows that for faith?..lol...  take your time youll get the hang of it ..
453785,laszlo,2010-04-09 11:35:00,487, Myagi...that's a lot of pressure to live up to. I hope your right! That day might be Mon. or Tues. morning when the river comes down.
454146,BillM,2010-04-10 02:05:00,17367," pft, fancy Wallis casters!!!!!!!   I used to have an issue with line twist until I started to run a swivel above my float.  Now it's a non issue.  Congrats Laszlo, it's a riot man... Definitely a fun way to fish.."
454309,laszlo,2010-04-10 16:11:00,487,I just came back from practising in the river behind my place. I can see why many use the side cast as it came to me pretty easily. The wallis cast...hmmm...not so much.  I will stick with it because I really don't want to deal with the line twisting. I wasn't able to get it more then 10 feet in front of me and my aim seemed to always land way to the right. I retrieve with my left and hold the rod with my right.  Any pointers would be great. Thanks
454319,Twocoda,2010-04-10 16:31:00,4130,Laz if your side casting you might find it easier to back cast as opposed to forhand cast...if your practising ...load up your line with shot to make it easier to get the feel of it ....then you can lighten up the line as you get the hang of it ...  i personally use the spinning sidecast in backhand ...line twist isnt too much of an issue and on the rare occurrence it does happen ....do a really loooooooong drift and it will correct itself...make sure your tag ends are nipoped off short as they act like props in the water creating twist regardless of the cast  Bills method is effective as well but you leave yourself with another vulnerability joint to break off
454643,laszlo,2010-04-11 14:20:00,487,Only had a half hour of free time this morning so I practised in the river behind my place again. Once again the side cast no problems. The Wallis cast is slowly improving...  Now on to Tues. morning to fish a river for more then 30 minutes that actually has fish in it or Steelhead to be more specific.
454858,BillM,2010-04-12 01:28:00,17367,"My buddy Dave does a weird combination of a Wallis/Side cast... Work really well for him...  You start a side cast like normal, but mid swing you get the reel going with a big tug...  Line comes off the front of the reel instead of the side..  Hard to explain but easier then your standard Wallis cast."
454864,Twocoda,2010-04-12 01:42:00,4130,  pretty much what the spinning sidecast is....
453250,laszlo,2010-04-08 00:32:00,487,Let the transition begin... Any tips would be great!
453251,raptorfan,2010-04-08 00:34:00,126,Awesome man.  As for tips........read my posts...  and do the opposite of what I do
453253,Kinger,2010-04-08 00:35:00,351,I get my first one very soon! I'm so excited.
453255,vinnimon,2010-04-08 00:37:00,2593,"I beleive I saw it on gloomis site.Casting with a center pin,a very short video on casting a few different ways."
453268,solopaddler,2010-04-08 00:58:00,8605,Congrat's you must be stoked!
453269,Richard S.,2010-04-08 01:00:00,75,Lots of paitience when learning how to cast.   Rich.
453271,StoneFly,2010-04-08 01:01:00,574," Good Stuff Laz!!  what did you get?  My first tip would be if you have 2 rods,..bring the pin and spinner until you are comfortable enough with the pin,..the first few outings can be frustarting especially if you have to cast far."
453272,vinnimon,2010-04-08 01:05:00,2593,"Solo,I dont think this gent is going to sleep tonight.If he does hes not going to dream about geenie.Maybe with his center pin he will.Sorry dude"
453274,vinnimon,2010-04-08 01:10:00,2593,"Sorry bud for the comment.You are going to enjoy center pinning for sure, as I do."
453275,l2p,2010-04-08 01:10:00,346,"I Also bought a new pin today, thought mine was in need of a major update. Heres a question ill ask for you, Are there any backing alternatives out there? i know about dacron annd not to use mono because it shrinks after it gets wet and what not so im interested to find out if there are other lines i could use as a substitute.  thanks."
453279,anglerspro,2010-04-08 01:16:00,25,check this video for the side cast which is the easiest for most people. http://www.raventackle.com/casting_videos.htm

453285,solopaddler,2010-04-08 01:24:00,8605,"  Dacron backing is only truly a necessity on the aerial style reels that have pins instead of a spool.  On a regular centrepin with a spool you can use anything you want as backing, doesn't have to be dacron. Any heavier mono is fine like 14lb XT for example. The reason for backing is to fill up the spool as many of the reels have ridiculously huge deep spools with enormous line capacities.  Another thing I've done is wind on a level 4wt fly line. It weighs absolutely nothing and acts as a simple arbour filling up the deep spool.  There's very, very few instances where you'll need more than 150 or so yards of line to work with."
453299,l2p,2010-04-08 01:43:00,346,"ahh i see, i always heard that the tension that builds up from wet mono was enough pressure to deform the drums of reels but i guess that would make sense since the new reels now are 1 peice machined aluminum. well in that case i will prolly wind up some heavy mono since the sst3 is a lilbit on the light side paired with my 14' im8."
453458,StoneFly,2010-04-08 06:40:00,574,Laz you should return the pin...apparently it is only for elitest 'snub-nosed' brats who do not know how to fish any other way!! and have too much money to spend LOL  this is of course coming from guys way north...who for the  most part have never used one...or used one properly.or just have an attitude...
453477,laszlo,2010-04-08 11:28:00,487," For me it's just another method to expand upon.  My spinning set up will still have it's use as well. In the early fall when the fish are very active, tossing spinners in mid-depth riffle water can be deadly as I learned last year. Plus...when they take it feels like they want to rip your arm off.  Also, not too sure how much of an elitest I can look like while fumbling around trying to figure out how to cast :/ I may need your help bud."
453481,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-08 11:43:00,2690,Enjoy!!!!!!!!!
453487,bassman87,2010-04-08 12:05:00,586,"start practising with the walist cast, side case will cause line twist and just p you off even mroe when on the river."
453488,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-08 12:11:00,0,enjoy that!  the first fish is the funnest!
453597,bare foot wader,2010-04-08 17:42:00,1354,"def learn the wallis cast as quick as possible, as mentioned, the side cast will cause you more headaches in the long run due to line twist...."

453600,Spiel,2010-04-08 17:49:00,9065, I'll third that.        
453612,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 18:16:00,655,"Congrats on the pin!  I recommend going to a field or your backyard and learn to wallace cast. I made the mistake of trying to learn to wallace cast with my first pin on a river when the bite was good. Learning to wallace cast went out the window! I just wanted to hook fish. Had to put up with bad line twist casting off the side of the reel after that.  Good luck with the new pin, there will be no looking back now"
453613,l2p,2010-04-08 18:17:00,346,"Learn how to control the spool with ur fingers, this will be crucial when tryin to control ur float in fast,slow water etc. It will all come into place, just like everything practice makes perfection. Just keep at it and know that there will be frustrations, just gotta deal with them.  *oh and dont forget to have fun with it!"
