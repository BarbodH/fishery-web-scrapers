While the Tax agent was checking the books he turned to the CFO of the hospital and said, ""I notice you buy a lot of bandages. What do you do with the end of the roll when there's too little left to be of any use?""  ""Good question,"" noted the CFO. ""We save them up and send them back to the bandage company and every now and then they send us a free box of bandages.""  ""Oh,"" replied the auditor, somewhat disappointed that his unusual question had a practical answer. But on he went, in his obnoxious way.  ""What about all these plaster purchases? What do you do with what's left over after setting a cast on a patient?""  ""Ah, yes,"" replied the CFO, realizing that the inspector was trying to trap him with an unanswerable question. ""We save it and send it back to the manufacturer, and every now and then they send us a free package of plaster.""  ""I see,"" replied the auditor, thinking hard about how he could fluster the know-it-all CFO. ""Well,"" he went on, ""What do you do with all the leftover foreskins from the circumcisions you perform?""  ""Here, too, we do not waste,"" answered the CFO. ""What we do is save all the little foreskins and send them to the Tax Office, and about once a year they send us a complete dick."""
