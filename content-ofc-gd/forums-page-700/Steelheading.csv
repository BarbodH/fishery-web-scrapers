Best part was I with a buddy (Dr. S), my girlfriend and my Dad on 3 consecutive days.  Made for some great days on the water. Now that my Dad got out he was fired up and took my Mom out a couple of times, they got into some fish since I left.  I also hooked and lost a massive fish, havent seen too many like that one in those rivers....I'll have to come back and catch it another time.     "
