454552,Twocoda,2010-04-11 03:15:00,4130," lmao...sounds like carolina needs a bit of work with the special teams....or maybe they are just too ""special"" to realize it  i think there will be some new faces around their locker room come Monday"

454658,Woodsman,2010-04-11 14:46:00,1286,Gee & I though you were going to mention something else as a first.  A loss to the lowly Leafs guaranty the Habs a post season spot.
454673,SlowPoke,2010-04-11 15:18:00,2984," No kidding, Rick! I've always hated the 3 point game. We knew teams were sneaking into the playoffs by losing in OT but the Leafs/Habs game... the perfect arguement against it.  Boston/Carolina.... yikes! I'd hate to be on the bad end of that statistic!"
454678,addymark,2010-04-11 15:33:00,69,all 3 with less than 1:20 left in the penalty
