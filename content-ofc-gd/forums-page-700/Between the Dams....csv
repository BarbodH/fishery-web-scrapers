Found a nice little pool and hookked on a nice fat nightcrawler in hopes of finding a kitty or two... After birdnesting the baitcaster 3 times, I decided to wait until I did some reading and switched to the spinning rig. No nibbles, but I saw a ton of fish surfacing. Saw a muskrat too... Oh well, it's a better way to spend the evening than watching the tube, right? Maybe I'll have some better luck on Monday, if the river slows down a bit. It's still flowing really fast."
454554,fishing,2010-04-11 03:26:00,167,Thanks for the report and I think that surfacing fish are sucker. Good luck.
454558,johndox,2010-04-11 03:51:00,54,agreed they likely were suckers if you were fishing down from the dam in Caledonia. Whats on Monday?? Im off work on Monday and might be interested in a trip to Dunnville for catfish. Let me know I have a boat and might be looking for a fishing partner.
454652,The JAY,2010-04-11 14:31:00,239,"Well, suckers are most likely what was surfacing, after seeing their dorsal fins. Monday, I'm going back down to the river and teaching myself how to use a baitcast... Seems today is going to be devoted to Geocaching again with the wife and at least one daughter... I'll have to try to keep the truck outta the mudholes this week... "

454759,The JAY,2010-04-11 21:26:00,239,I'm putting on some 10LB Spiderwire MONO. Have it on my others and I really like it. Maybe I can sneak out tonight to check the river.... Where's my wife?.............
454766,vinnimon,2010-04-11 21:55:00,2593,"Suckers are whats surfacing the grand.Some mistake them for bows, due to the silver on their backs."
454802,basskicker09,2010-04-11 23:42:00,144,catch some sucker and keep it for bait for the cats
454818,Rizzo,2010-04-12 00:10:00,4754,not sure anyone could cast a nightcrawler with a couple of splitshot with a baitcaster so don't give up. Baitcasting takes a bit of practice so do yourself a favor and tie on something with some weight that flies like an arrow. For lobbing a worm out there a baitcaster (notice the irony) wouldn't be my choice.
454837,The JAY,2010-04-12 01:06:00,239,"LOL! I never thought about the irony, but you're right Rizzo. Rob, I was wondering about that, is there more to 'cut bait' than just butchering a sucker, or is there some secret herbs and spices.... Anyway, I went down to the river again tonight. Seems to be dropping abit, but still fast. 3 decent sized suckers. Better than an evening in front of the tube..."
