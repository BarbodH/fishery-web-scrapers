CRAA has commenced its daily fish lifts at the Streetsville ladder and will continue 7 days a week until completed. The purpose is to transfer wild fish above the dam to suitable habitat and promote a wild self sustaining fish population. It’s a fantastic opportunity to come and give back to the resource. Fish lifts commence daily at 5pm and continue until completion so come early if possible, please bring waders, or if not possible wet weather clothing and boots. Parking is at the top of the entrance to the fish way at the bottom DrenKellY.  Please be there on time as once we commence the gates will be locked and no one will be permitted access FISH LIFTS ARE WEATHER DEPENDANT SO PLEASE CHECK THE CRAA WEBSITE MESSAGE BOARD FOR INFORMATION ON CANCELLATIONS www.craa.on.ca  You may also sign up for the CRAA steelhead derby while at the ladder and you must sign in at the lifts via a clip board provided.
