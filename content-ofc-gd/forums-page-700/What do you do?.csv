455083,The JAY,2010-04-12 17:48:00,239,"As a buyer, I'd walk away. There's no shortage of boats out there, and it's not worth the headache. Just my opinion..."
455117,POLLIWOGG,2010-04-12 19:30:00,835,Talk to the lien holder and pay with a check made out to the owner and the lien holder. As long as you get all parties to agree shouldn't be a problem.
455156,irishfield,2010-04-12 21:52:00,26272,.. be thankful that he was honest and told you!! Most don't ask.. don't tell and don't know until the lien holder comes knocking.  Always be alert... name on vessel licence.. matches seller.. get his DOB.. First and last name.. address and serial number on the item you are buying and call Consumer and Commercial Relations to check for liens.  My link  Now dealt with by ServiceOntario.
