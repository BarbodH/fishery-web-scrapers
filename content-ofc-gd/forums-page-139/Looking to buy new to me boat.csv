955695,Loonietoon,2016-02-01 22:35:00,1450, I think Kelvin's looking to upgrade... I need a bigger motor though
955754,wormdunker,2016-02-02 06:22:00,1711,"fisherman 7 - It's a 20 hp.  My boat has a full floor, electric bow mount, 2 batteries & regular load of fishing gear.  Goes 23 mph with just me in the boat.  I had an older 30 hp Suzuki that was crazy fast at 29 mph.  A little too fast for me.  Good luck in your search.  You won't be disappointed with a Lund."
955756,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-02 07:45:00,8243,"29MPH, crazy fast? Oh Worndunker,man you are showing your age.  Kelvin, get 2 footitis and get something you can come out here and get out 10 miles and hammer those horse size Walleye on Erie. My 19 foot StarCraft can get into back bays on any lake and river and is comfortable enough that we can get out on the big lakes when I pick my days and feel safe enough to get back in from 10 miles out if the weather turns. I can stretch my legs, when there is 2 of us and I leave a few seats home I can put on a good tune and dance in the thing. There have been days I wish I had a 25 foot glass boat out on Erie but I am less adventurous now and watch the weather like a hawk. Go bigger or go home.  Good luck on your shopping, I come across many boats in my travels and will keep my eye open for you."

The important thing as far as I'm concerned is the reputation of the dealer or the private seller. The distance away from you that the dealer is, and the layout of the boat for your needs. We don't all need the same things in a boat. I presently have a Princecraft tiller with a 60HP 4 stroke. It's perfect for me. If I can afford another boat before I turn in my chips, it'll probably be another similar boat."
