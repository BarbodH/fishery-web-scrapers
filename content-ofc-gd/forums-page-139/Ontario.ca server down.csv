I tried to renew my license yesterday online, at Gagnons, and at the Whitby Service Ontario kiosk with all resulting in the same outcome-the server is down.  Just over a year ago, the Ontario.ca server was hacked. Im sure there were a few of us who opposed the idea of having the server located in Tennesee. In hindsight, there doesn't seem to be anything that the gov't can do/control on this side of the border.  To my knowledge, it's almost been a full 24hrs since the site went down."
