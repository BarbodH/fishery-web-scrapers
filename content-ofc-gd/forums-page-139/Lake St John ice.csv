956486,misfish,2016-02-06 18:04:00,29133,"        Drilled over 40+ holes. Good ice.10"" There was no fish harmed. There was no minnows eaten. Your secrets safe Mikey."
956490,cheaptackle,2016-02-06 18:19:00,849,"So I picked the right truck after all - cool! Sorry to hear no luck - it happens.  Couldn't really see you out there unless that was you right on shore almost (doubt it). Noticed a couple ridges up this end, one obviously very wet with the new snow really showing it.  Watched two guys walk out from the west shore only to turn back to shore to head south around the wet line at shore before coming back out, so I guess they didn't find it safe enough to cross. Not as many out there today as last week it seems.  Michael"
956498,misfish,2016-02-06 18:48:00,29133,"We went to the wall. 22 fow, worked the area. Then headed in to try and find weeds. Then we did do the crack line. No fish, but lots of walking and excersice..  That was terrys truck beside me."
956501,cheaptackle,2016-02-06 19:05:00,849,"You must not have used a hut then - didn't see any along that area you describe anyhow.  I saw yer sled tracks leaving the trucks and figured I had about 50/50 chance of picking the right one, along with not thinking you had a 4x4 for some reason.  From what you say I don't think you quite came far enough - with the binos I can see the crack you describe, and it would be past that a bit more.  The ones I can really see are much further along than that, they'd be past where I suggested. Maybe next time!  Michael"
952984,lovetofish,2016-01-13 02:58:00,500,"If you could keep me posted on how much snow is on top of the ice, that would be great"
952999,misfish,2016-01-13 12:05:00,29133,"We got a real good dumping over night. about 10"". Thankfully, it,s the light stuff. Wind should blow it off. I hope. I don't like walking were I cant see the ice. New ice that is. I,ll need to dig out the snow shoes me thinks."
953006,cheaptackle,2016-01-13 13:07:00,849,"We didn't get hardly as much - maybe 3-4"" - those squalls stayed south overnight.  I'll try jumping up and down (gently) on the shore ice this afternoon when I get home.  If that's ok I may wander out a bit.  Or not.  We'll see...  Michael"
953060,cheaptackle,2016-01-13 18:23:00,849,"OK - water rose again overnight so there's soft water on my bit of beach, then the thin new stuff.  I stepped on to the ice from some rocks where it's a couple feet deep and it felt pretty firm, so I gave it a bit of a go and walked out a step or two (brave - that's me NOT!) giving a couple hops and listening, no cracking noise and I didn't break thru.  Couldn't see any open water other than at the beach, snow coverage is not significant, a few inches at most I'd say.  If I really had to go fishing I'd take the next step and test it out with a spud and decide from there.  Can't use one right now so that's all I can offer - if you're gonna risk it be smart about it.  I'll stay inside and use the binoculars instead.  I'll check again Friday afternoon but I'm thinking it can only get better from here. Be safe!  Michael"
953067,misfish,2016-01-13 19:01:00,29133,"Thanks Michael.  I would guess if the snow is done for now, the ice should be good."
953085,cheaptackle,2016-01-13 21:22:00,849,"Welcome Brian - have to admit the pucker factor was quite high, normally wouldn't be an issue in just a couple feet of water but even that was intimidating with this bum arm.  I figured it was close enough to shore for it to be given a try and was REAL glad it held up.  Hopefully it will be a lot thicker and more solid by the weekend, think we'll have the temperatures for it.  I won't be partaking this season tho, even a slip and fall would be devastating to me right now, mightn't do any damage but guaranteed to be most definitely painfully hurtlikeasumbitch unpleasant (ya I can scream too!).  Michael"
953100,lovetofish,2016-01-13 22:45:00,500,Thanks a lot Micheal! Glad everything worked out for your safety. We will be heading up on Sunday for the day. We will be in a big blue clam Bigfoot xl4000t. Anyone is more then welcome to stop by and say hi!  LTF
953162,cheaptackle,2016-01-14 16:17:00,849,"Welcome LTF - if I wasn't both bored and curious myself I mightn't have dared even that little bit, but...cabin fever ya know! I'll check it again tomorrow as well as off the floating dock my other neighbour left in - it's about 3 feet deep there and 25 feet off shore so it should be a bit more representative of conditions.  Michael"
953306,cheaptackle,2016-01-15 18:10:00,849,"Came home - walked down to the shore & turned right around to go in the house. Observations - my shoreline is wet including where I tested yestereday - water level is up a bit again.  However, on the south shore west of the bluebird launch I can see several portable huts and maybe 1 large permanent are out & people walking around.  No sign of any machines though so maybe the large permanent is a real large portable.  binoculars can't see thru the trees so good ha ha! Be safe out there!  Michael"
953367,misfish,2016-01-16 01:23:00,29133,"Michael  Thank you very much for the great updates and reports. Im sure there have been a few thousand on lookers seeing your updates, and thats all well and good. You may have saved a few from going in for a cold wake up call, or maybe even not a wake up.  Im thinking Im going to sit back and wait one more week. Next week looks like more  ice making temps.  Once again, thank you."
953455,cheaptackle,2016-01-16 17:37:00,849,"Guess the onlookers had a different idea Brian - took a turn by the bluebird launch on my way back from town this morning, they're parking on the street cause they ain't no room anywhere else.  Out on the lake looks like the portable hut version of the ice fishing scenes in Grumpy Old Men - it's a zoo out there!!!  Even Cooch was well populated by the Curling club, and airport rd west of rama rd was full too.  My shoreline is even wetter than it was yesterday, guess it's just wet if there's that many out there.  Even looks like some snowmobile tracks pretty far out but I can't say for sure, don't see any machines out there. I just hope that all are checking and double checking to be safe, rather than a bunch of lemmings have followed one daredevil!  Remember it was just about 3 weeks ago they were water skiing out there!  Michael"
953460,misfish,2016-01-16 17:46:00,29133,"With todays winds, Im glad I decided to wait. There are reports of ice breaking up on Simcoe today. Lets hope no one gets themselves in trouble out there."
953694,lovetofish,2016-01-18 02:29:00,500,"Went out today drilled lots of holes, 5-6"" of black ice in every hole will drilled. All around bike bird park. Couldn't believe how many people were there! The most I have ever seen, so much for quiet  LTF"

956310,cheaptackle,2016-02-05 19:09:00,849,"My experience with cracking ice is that it's either good or bad...Good if the ice is forming although it can result in pressure ridges, and bad if, well, if it's deteriorating and that's someplace ya don't wanna be when it's happening.  From what I've seen the last two days - subject to you verifying for yourself - the ice is forming again although I also think the lake level has risen a bit again too.  Glad you had a good day, caught fish and are able to tell about it! Welcome to the board!  Michael"

I have not seen any real bad happening there by anglers ( during the winter that is ) The odd garbage,but pick it up. I know there seems to be a few bass tournys going on there during the year. Maybe the locals are not liking this. Or maybe some people want all the walleye to them self. LOL Go ahead,you can have them. LOL"
952257,cheaptackle,2016-01-07 23:44:00,849,"We got a notice about the launch by the Stepan plant when they closed it (not before - WHEN!) The Stepan plant closed the Longford Mills Rd. access when they discovered it was on their property.  The one oft repeated word was liabiltity, which is perfectly understandable these days even though the many many years prior to their discovery of ownership were absolutely free of any concerns.  Reality is if someone got stuck launching a boat and tore out a tranny doing it they could go after Stepan for not maintaining the launch. As for the other launch I'm not sure what's up down there. But from what I read and hear it's happening all over the province.  Michael"
952258,lovetofish,2016-01-07 23:54:00,500,There is no other good launch
952259,Kerry,2016-01-07 23:55:00,383,"I don't know, they started cleaning up Bluebird Park a couple years or so ago and making it a so called launch albeit a lousy one that was already much as it is.Then last year the launch at Stepan was closed off by Stepan.Ramara posted some nonsense about them not knowing the launch was on Stepan property which is Bull as I understood it was Domtar(original company) property years ago and Ramara was maintaining the launch for public access.Sad considering they dumped several loads of stone the previous year and did a pretty good job of smoothing out the launch area.Now ramara decides to close in the lane to Bluebird to the point where only cartoppers will be able to use it.Well I guess tooners too so you will be OK.lol. As far as garbage the Stepan side was much better in the last couple years but maybe Stepan had enough of being the land stewart to slobs - who knows.Maybe Ramara is going the same route.Sucks as you don't need to worry about boat traffic on a small lake nearly as much-it really is a good fishing lake not a lot of cottager traffic on it.

952279,cheaptackle,2016-01-08 02:01:00,849,"I believe its 32 new homes going in there - interestingly called My Rama Lakefront (hmmm...)  My boss did the clearing & put the road in.  It will be a private road strictly for the development as I understand it.  Good thing about the trailer park that was there being gone is that it took a ton of boats off the lake, much quiter now.  Sad thing was the year rounders that lost their homes. And yes Stepan is a surfactant (soap) plant that has had a number of owners including Domtar over the years.  Don't know what triggered them to determine to close the ramp based on ""finding they owned the land"".  That'd be something to hear I think. Didn't see anyone out there fishing today - can't see the whole lake from where I am on the north shore.  Michael"
