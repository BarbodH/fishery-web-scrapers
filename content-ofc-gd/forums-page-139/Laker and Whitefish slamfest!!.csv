The trips the past couple of weeks have seen amazing action with lots of Lakers and Whitefish caught.  Humps and underwater points in 35 to 60ft using set minnow lines and small minnow tipped jigs have been the ticket! Remember to be safe out there and check the ice often as it can change quickly.  Stay safe and Good Fish'n!.... Greg.    "
