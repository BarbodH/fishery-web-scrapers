Specific details about what the partnership will look like haven't been released yet, however Chief Scott McLeod and council have reached a consensus. According to a notice to membership issued by Nipissing First Nation Friday afternoon, chief and council had two choices – “rely on the status quo to manage our fishery going forward, which has not been an effective and accountable method for our members,” or “work in partnership with the ministry to manage the lake and move towards a more sustainable fishery while supporting the implementation of our own Fisheries Law and management plans.” The notices states chief and council chose the second option and referred to it as being in the best interests of the fish, the community and collective rights for now and future generations. According to Genevieve Couchie, spokeswoman for Nipissing First Nation, the memorandum has yet to be signed, “No formal announcement will be issued until the minutes are approved at the next council meeting scheduled for Feb. 16.” Chief and council decided to close the commercial fishery in August, which is a few months early. Data showed the walleye fishery in Lake Nipissing was severely stressed and Nipissing First Nation had exceeded safe harvest levels. According to Nipissing First Nation, closing the fishery before Aug. 31 effectively reduces the season by more than half - to just over three months from seven. The closure will remain in effect until the end of the 2016 spring fisheries moratorium. McLeod said in a previous interview “this is not a decision that is taken lightly. We understand it directly affects the membership.” Nipissing First Nation has been in discussions with the ministry for more than a year, according to the Notice to Membership posted on the NFN website. Both parties were looking to come to an understanding on how they can work together to best manage the fishery. “Nipissing First Nation has struggled with the implementation of its Fisheries Law, particularly due to issues of non-compliance around spring and fall moratoriums and commercial fishing regulations. According to Nipissing First Nation, a Memorandum of Understanding is not legally binding, however it does carry a degree of seriousness and mutual respect. “Nipissing First Nation can withdraw from the MOU at any time if it is not helping,” it states. “The MOU also does not allow for the surrender of the existing treaty rights of Nipissing people. It's about maintaining our right to fish by using the data we collect and receive to better manage the lake and to protect the resource for current and future generations.” "
