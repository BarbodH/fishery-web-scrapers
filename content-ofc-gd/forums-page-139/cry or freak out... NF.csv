956392,Steelheadphycho,2016-02-06 01:05:00,470,My God Rick! The emotional roller coaster your family has ridden in these few days!  Your all in my thoughts
956055,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 15:01:00,11391,"Ive never been so sad and mad at the same time?  Il let our cat out this morning as per usual...  Kids are getting ready for the school bus and I hear screaming from my daughter as I ready the lunches.  I run outside and our dog is rag dolling our cat! Wth???  I grab sweetie(our cat) and ivy (our dog) is just going nuts trying to get at her.  These are beloved pets that have always got along. I dont understand it?  Sweetie cant walk and its vet time, i think maybe her back is broken? She can move around but no use in the back legs when she tries to stand???  Ughhh im so friggen mad, 10 years and im afraid she gonna have to be put down.  Sad day regardless in our household?"
956058,BillM,2016-02-04 15:12:00,17367,Put the cat down.
956059,Big Cliff,2016-02-04 15:13:00,6899,"Oh man, I am so sorry to hear that! You have to wonder what happened to make the dog snap and worse yet you have to wonder if you can ever trust the dog again especially with small children around. Sounds like the kindest thing you can do for the cat is have it put down, a broken back can't be fixed. As for the dog...... I know what I would do as hard as it might be!"
956060,AKRISONER,2016-02-04 15:13:00,5558,wth!  i swear sometimes dogs just tick...and they literally turn to wild animals again. Ugh that must be aweful.
956063,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-04 15:18:00,8243,That is terrible news Rick. Especially with the kids witnessing it. I have heard of this happening many times before. The Dog never bothers the Cat for years and then one day just attacks it. My own dog years ago got along great with all the kids then one afternoon for no reason or provocation took a chunk out of my 4 year old niece. The Vet said this can happen with a dog when it gets older. Watch that dog closely M2.
956064,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 15:20:00,11391,"Sweetie is going in at 1030. I had hoped maybe she was just in shock.  She moves her legs etc but she cant get up.  Pretty sure the vet will put her down as much as i hate to say it.  But our dogs are invaluable to us as much as our cats. I dont think i can put her down on her instincs(she is a hunting dog/siberian husky)  Im just so mad at her! Shes never been anything other than superb with the kids and cats.  I mean, i dont know, maybe she was playing and took it too far?  Maybe she snapped? I dont friggen know?  Never ever have we had an issue with our dogs or cats for that matter, geebus"
956066,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 15:28:00,11391,Our cat has no claws so this must be from ivy as i tried to rescue our cat  
956069,highdrifter,2016-02-04 15:32:00,2534,"Wow man.  That's very strange and kind of unsettling at the same time.  I'd say keep an eye on your pooch..  If he starts to wig out, you're going to want to quarantine him.."
956076,bare foot wader,2016-02-04 16:26:00,1354,dog has all of his vaccines...distemper/parvo?  possible the cat was already injured somehow and triggered the attack?
956081,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 16:34:00,11391,Yes and no.  Sweetie was always one to play. Shed lay on her back and they would just play and shed leave when she had enough.  Not sure what happend honestly?   Our poor cat and our poor kiddos???
956085,mr blizzard,2016-02-04 16:57:00,1589,That just plain sucksFive years ago we had to put our 18 year old cat down. That was bad enough But your challenged even more. I know what I would do but I appreciate your positionAs mentioned keep a close eye on the dog. Showing those signsYes your dogs are important BUT your kids are more important than any dog imho  especially with a little one on the way
956087,Gallie,2016-02-04 17:03:00,1215,"Thats terrible bud, always sad to see this stuff happen. I have a 100lb american bulldog that is truly a big suck, but no matter what i will never trust her 100% particularily around my daughter, you just never know with an animal. Best of luck with whatever you do."
956094,bare foot wader,2016-02-04 17:14:00,1354,"even the best trained dogs are still animals, and huskys are more wild in nature than most dogs I'd say, not the first time I've heard of a husky snapping (sad stories in Calgary and somewhere in Quebec got national spotlight a few years ago)  you have mentioned before your dog has scrapped with coyotes and wolves right?...I'd keep a close eye on the dog and keep him quarantined until he can see a vet, run some blood work for distemper/whatever else, just to be safe"
956098,GBW,2016-02-04 17:28:00,8460,"sorry to hear this my friend. as others have said, watch the dog closely. more so with the baby any time now because if the dog has turned then all small beings can be a target for it. not saying that is why things happened today as they did but my buddy had to put his husky down many years ago. my sister breeds Weimaraner's for show and hunting if something happens and you need a new pup. again, sorry to hear man!"
956099,captpierre,2016-02-04 17:38:00,2521,Crazy. As a vet I see this sort of thing often. If kitty can move back legs the spinal cord is intact. There is hope. Back can still be broken. X-rays will help sort it out. Good luck.
956100,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 17:41:00,11391,Sweetie has been put down.  She had her lungs pierced   ???
956101,davew3,2016-02-04 17:42:00,430,"Rick,  Sorry to hear about your cat.  Some say  just a cat.  But then what next?  You hope nothing ever. Sorry to say."
956103,Freshtrax,2016-02-04 17:45:00,2215,"Sorry to hear, suprized The cat and  husky got along at all,  my family has had a few cat killing huskys over they years."
956115,netminder,2016-02-04 18:46:00,514,"My current cat was attacked by my old dog the day we found the cat. She wandered into our yard as a small kitten and I think my old/mostly blind/mostly deaf dog mistook the cat for a squirrel and went at her. A repaired punctured lung and hernia later I now have a 10 year old cat that is almost 20 lbs. Sometimes dogs can get confused or something could have happened and it was being territorial. They are still animals, after all. Not to say you shouldn't keep an eye on this dog from now on...  Sorry to hear about the cat though. Especially the kids having to see that."
956155,HTHM,2016-02-04 22:58:00,4082,I have no words...except I'm sorry you had that happen.
956171,leaf4,2016-02-04 23:52:00,2466,"Terrible, that's unbelievable for that to just happen all of a sudden between two who are so used to each other, so sorry for your loss! I've had my kitty for a little over 2 months now and couldn't imagine something like that, he's such a good companion"
956192,manitoubass2,2016-02-05 01:03:00,11391,Said and done.  Thanks for the kind words everyone.  She will be layed next to her old pal pheonix(our old boxer)
956194,Weeds,2016-02-05 01:19:00,782,That's pretty terrible. I don't see a dog like that having any place in a home that's got young kids or a baby in it.  Your in a tough spot though. I just don't see how you could ever really trust that dog again.
956253,limeyangler,2016-02-05 13:57:00,5204,"sorry for your family's loss Rick, RIP Sweetie."
956383,Joey,2016-02-05 23:45:00,9122,"Sorry to hear this Rick. I too would recommend keeping a close eye on the dog now, but I'm sure you already know that.  Good luck and RIP Sweetie"
