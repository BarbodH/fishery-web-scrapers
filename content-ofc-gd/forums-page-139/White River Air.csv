956436,bronzeback,2016-02-06 14:12:00,30,My report for Hambleton lake is the one on Mike's site.  The lake is stuffed with walleye and the average size is bigger than any of the other lakes we have fished in the area.  Pike were few and far between but the bragging wall in the cabin shows they are there if you target them.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  PM me with any questions.
