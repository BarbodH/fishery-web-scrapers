956616,Garcia96,2016-02-07 17:26:00,45,"me & buddies are planing on going camping up north this year. I never fished up north before and dying to try it out and just enjoy relaxing outdoors to get away from everything. We're looking for good private tent camping sites probablly right beside the water. A friend of mine went to windy lake last year but never went fishing. He loved the camping beside the water though!  Locations in mind is     WIndy lake , French river , Ivanhoe lake , or missinaibi Those are just some I seen online and was wondering if there is good private tent sites near the water? And of course good fishing. Mostly targeting pike and bass. Any suggestions and want to know your own experiences !"
956617,huzzsaba,2016-02-07 17:45:00,884,Check out Bonnechere Provincial Park.  Never been there but has great reviews and seems like decent riverfront sites.
956627,muskymatt,2016-02-07 18:47:00,2608,Algonquin park is a haven for rivers and linked lakes with great fishing and very private sites. Look at this link http://www.algonquinmap.com/
956661,Woodsman,2016-02-07 22:17:00,1286,Check out Finlayson Point Provincial Park on Lake Temagami.
956668,Garcia96,2016-02-07 22:55:00,45,Musky mat do you know specific lakes in Algonquin ? Having hard times reading that map. And woodsman I will check up that lake. Thanks for some ideas!!
956669,irishfield,2016-02-07 22:56:00,26272,"There are only 4 or 5 true water sites in Finlayson. Site #11 is the best one and we see the same people on it year after year for the past decade. Book ahead if you want water. Early season and late season one 1/2 of the park is gated off closed, and that is where the other two water sites are. There are a number of them along the shoreline road, but they are back side sites. You also can't tie a boat up to shore, has to go in the park marina.  If you have a boat.. skip the park and just grab the first crown site, almost directly across from the park, and set up there. Quick trip to town for supplies, park to use the comfort station, etc. Free vs $30 a night. I probably should stop pointing that out before the park ends up closed...."

956716,Acountdeleted,2016-02-08 14:45:00,2562,"If you don't mind the long trip, a co-worker of mine went to Lake Superior Provencal park last year and said he boated about 30 walleye in half an hour."
956775,fish_fishburn,2016-02-08 20:24:00,1311,Go west of Deep River on the Ottawa River. Find a nice beach and set up camp. Best part is its free and the fishing is good.
956831,chris.brock,2016-02-09 04:53:00,4053,"Wakami would be my pick too. Great waterfront sites. No bass though.  I wasn't big on Ivanhoe. Missinaibi is cool but the sites are set back. In Algonquin, Kiosk had some good waterfront sites and bass."
956884,bow slayer,2016-02-09 17:18:00,1074,"If you want i could give all  info you need on Restoule.The park is set back off 11 and has a remote setting ,has several good water sites plus several back country sites on the water. Fishing is good for walleye,bass,pike,musky and lakers. Best part most of the lakes have very little development along the shore hence very light traffic.Crown land surrounds most of the area lakes.Park has good launches and docking.North Bay is only 40 minutes away.  wakimi also sounds like a good option. I have never been but hoping to make it there this summer. Bonnechere is another nice option. Has lots of water sites with access to the lake. Great sand beach,the fishing is very good for bass and pike. Matter of a fact we were catching all day long right from our site on the water. There is also walleye and lakers. Ottawa ,Pembroke,and Petawawa close by. Good place to camp if you want to try some white water rafting on the Ottawa river also."
