956802,Fishenforcer,2016-02-08 23:16:00,18,Hey Mike. Trip was great. We miscalculated on how high the river would be that time of year so specks were tough but we did manage to get into them. I lost one(break off) that was probably 5lbs. Walleye and Pike fishing were awesome and the camp had everything you needed and more. Such a big lake to try and cover in 5 days so this year we are going back for 7 days and will be better prepared for the speck fishing. Can't wait!!!!

The rest of the time I'll be hitting the local lakes and streams and hopefully at least one more trip to my favourite smallie spot before the owner of the lake sells. By the way if anyone wants a private lake in the middle of Midwestern Ontario with amazing fishing and has a few million lying around have I got the place for you - you've only got to let me fish there whenever I want lol.
