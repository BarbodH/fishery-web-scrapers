The screen was active all morning, but boy were they tight to the bottom. That meant only one thing, set up the tip up,hook up some saltys on a small treble and let it lay on the bottom.  My longtime friend Rob C, hooked up with me this morning. It,s been a few years since we fished together. Was nice getting out and catching up. He had his fair share of fish (chances  ) this morning as well.  Back to the tip up. It just moved so slightly and stopped. Grabbed it,lift,felt wieght and up came a nice whitie. Followed by a nice size herring.  Fish left,so did we.  Good seeing you again bud, lets get out again soon.      Got to try out the new Milwaukie fuel 1200 touq with the 8"" finbor. It makes quick work I can tell you that. TOTALLY INPRESSED.  STAY SAFE OUT THERE ALL."
