Next thing I know neighbour has involved the town, and the town now wants the back quarter of the house torn down or a new foundation built. Either way we get put out the door.  At least I have a good 3 months to find another decent home."

956235,wormdunker,2016-02-05 10:22:00,1711,"I'd move north, quicker than a heart beat!  But 2 daughters & 3 grandchildren keep me in Niagara.  I keep telling my wife we 'd only be 4 or 5 hour drive from them.  She could visit them every week end, while I go fishing!  LOL!"
956265,Dara,2016-02-05 15:15:00,3052,Moved up here from downtown Toronto when I was 15 because my dad got a job on a long construction project. I can't think of any place I would rather live.
