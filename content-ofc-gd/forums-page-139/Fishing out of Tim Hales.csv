955870,Big Cliff,2016-02-03 09:07:00,6899,"Woke up yesterday morning and found out I had the day off; sat here for a bit reading the fishing reports and decided that I'd take a run over to Tim's and see if he had any huts available. It was last minute, I didn't have a reservation, and I didn't leave here until almost 7:30 so I wasn't sure what to expect.  When I arrived there was a sign on the door saying they were out on the ice but to call their number. Kim (Tim's wife) answered, said she'd be right down (what a sweetheart), got me all fixed up and aranged for me to meet Tim over at the harbour.  Well it turned out to be a wonderful choice; 5 minutes into the hut and I hauled up a beautiful perch! For about the next hour or so it was pretty steady, not a lot of really big ones but most were in the 10+"" range. It slowed down for a bit but at about 1:00 pm both rods went off; two double headers at the same time and all 4 fish were beauties.  From then until about 4:00 when they picked me up I never did get my second line back in the water, almost as fast as I could re bait and get my line back down I'd get another hit. I ended up keeping 15 and I lost count early in the game but I'll bet I could have filled a 5 gal. pail if I'd kept them all.  Thanks to Kim & Tim for a wonderful day, the huts were clean and comfortable, the fishing was terrific and I'll be back a few more times before this winter is over!"
955871,DanD,2016-02-03 11:45:00,2223,Great report Cliff. Nice when all the pieces fall into place; isn't it.  Dan.
955875,porkpie,2016-02-03 13:34:00,2521,"Last minute trips are often the best.  Less time for Murphy to catch up with you!  Nice haul, and probably best that you got out when you did."
955889,bigugli,2016-02-03 15:06:00,6138,"Nice to hear you had a successful outing, Cliff. You deserve it."
955911,Beans,2016-02-03 16:39:00,3339,Nice to hear you got some Cliff...Will be messy out there today and God knows what the shoreline will be like...
955919,Joey,2016-02-03 16:58:00,9122,That's awesome Cliff.  A great day for sure
955945,crappieperchhunter,2016-02-03 20:28:00,2582,Sounds like a good road trip Cliff. Enjoy the fish fry.
956369,ketchenany,2016-02-05 23:18:00,3229,"Good going Cliff, BTW you may still have lots of 5gal pails"
956374,wormdunker,2016-02-05 23:24:00,1711,"Way to go Cliff.  You have the knack.   We were at Port Bolster Tuesday &  Wednesday.  Got a few.  In hindsight, wish we went to Beaverton"
956562,captpierre,2016-02-07 00:06:00,2521,Great report Cliff. How's the leg?  Some brutal cold coming next weekend.
956582,Big Cliff,2016-02-07 09:36:00,6899,"Knee is still giving me trouble. Dr. said it's a torn meniscus. They just did an MRI last Monday but I don't get back in to see the specialist until mid March so I won't know what happens next until then. In the mean time I just have to be very careful to not put any side pressure on the knee or it gives out on me then hurts like crazy for a while. Could be a whole lot worse, plenty of people out there wish they had a leg!"
956589,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-07 13:51:00,8243,"They tend not to operate on torn cartilage once past 40 anylonger Cliff. My wife tore one a few winters back, told she can live with it and she does."
956626,Big Cliff,2016-02-07 18:41:00,6899,"And so will I probably! what will be, will be!"
956650,captpierre,2016-02-07 20:39:00,2521,"Glad to hear nothing serious, Cliff. Could be worse. You'll be good to go fish with me this season."
956654,Bill Shearer,2016-02-07 21:40:00,456,"Many times a quality metal/fabric brace by Breg or others can direct the bones to wear a new spot in the miniscus you have left. Of course it's by prescription, and of course they are not cheap, but if you have a plan, they are covered. I have one for each knee, and have worn them for years. The doctors now say that knee replacements are my only fix, and I'm not willing yet. Those braces gave me 5 good years, (plus two more so-so years) although they can be a PITA. Don't try and go through airport security with them on! You get to go into small rooms with two guys who want you to drop your pants. lol"
