955727,tomkat,2016-02-02 01:07:00,246,Picked one up for a good price at Lebaron seems pretty nice. Anyone used one?
955735,Gregoire,2016-02-02 02:45:00,1397,I picked one up before Christmas. Used it on my NZ trip. It is a nice solid rod. Hoping I'll get to use it in Florida in March.
955876,tomkat,2016-02-03 14:02:00,246,I got the medium action and it can be used as a 7 or 8 foot rod . Supposedly it was 200 dollars on clearance for 90? Should fit in the overhead by the look of it
