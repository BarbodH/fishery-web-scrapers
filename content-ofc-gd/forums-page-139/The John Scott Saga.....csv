955632,206,2016-02-01 01:42:00,563,I wanted him to skate the rink holding his MVP like the Stanley Cup.....he kept it classy tho. lol
955634,G.mech,2016-02-01 02:02:00,830,"And Bettman has the audacity to sit there and say that the NHL supported John all the way.....wow.  Besides that gong show, it was one of the better All Star presentations I've seen ever since my kids started making me watch it 15 years ago.  It was actually fairly entertaining and it was kinda fun watching the John Scott saga unfold!"

953752,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-18 17:32:00,8243,"And award 2 points to the holder of the Cup they win. As far as the All Star team give more $$, money seems to bring out effort, sometimes. As far as 1 team being able to get 2 more points than the rest? Well you hockey minds will figure it out."
953766,fishermccann,2016-01-18 18:22:00,655,"They should let him play, for some it does not matter, but for him it would make his whole career. He could just be a regular player not captain."

954018,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-19 17:28:00,8243,What else could have done by Betman and the NHL in order to save face? I feel bad for the guy that should have legitimately gone to play in the All Star game but Scott took his place.
954021,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-19 17:33:00,10439,I really hope he has a chat with some of the guys he's going to be playing against and they agree to have a fake (AKA WWE) fight during the game. Just to rub it in the NHL and Betman's face.  If you truly want All Stars in the all star game don't allow voting any player in. Have a list you can vote for.  And if you don't do it that way don't be surprised by who gets voted in and then try to change things after the fact. Learn from your mistake and change things up next year.
954027,Gallie,2016-01-19 18:00:00,1215,I hope he scores lol

954032,G.mech,2016-01-19 18:17:00,830,"Cool, I might actually watch some if it now.  I wonder if there was a method to the madness of the NHL on this......maybe they were counting on this whole saga to develop some fan interest but that may be giving them too much credit for their intelligence."
954045,woodenboater,2016-01-19 19:57:00,2277,"they need to rethink the entire fan balloting thing. that scott got in because imo, people were making him a joke, is kind of sad. nhl should pick a wide field of players, then let fans choose from that or else this is going to happen next yer. guaranteed."
954046,Mike Pike,2016-01-19 20:04:00,1332,"The absurdity of the fan balloting has had a most unintended result for the NHL.  It's created the most talked about All-Star game in history!  ...I still won't watch it, though."

As for Scott, yup he should have never been voted into the All Star game, Not even a question, But he did. It doesn't matter that the clam is too stupid to prevent this from happening, Scott got in, fair and square. He should play. He got there, let him play. Maybe Betman will grow some stones and actually do something positive for a change.  I apologize in advance to any clams that I have offended......muddler"

Personally I think Mr. Scott should contact a lawyer to see if there are grounds to sue the NHL, Arizona Coyotes and the Montreal Canadiens.

He has no place in this league and for that I'm glad, but he is just a guy who is trying to do what he needs to do. I doubt I would be any different.  The league has had at least 2 previous write-in campaigns and they still failed to anything to prevent this. Proving once again that they are fools. Willy loved his fools.  Scott himself didn't want any part of this but that is the theatre."

I don't know the guy but I know I couldn't have a guy like him work for me. A practical social media joke gone bad? Is he really that bad? When Zedeno Chiarra (sic) came into the league apparently he was a poor skater for an NHL player according to a WGR 550 discussion yesterday. He worked hard at it and has done well.  As far as a law suit, what are his real damages? Is there a bonus or game cheque for the All Star game? Maybe they paid him anyway."

The All Star game *should* be the best/ most popular players in the league and that Scott *could* have taken the spot from a more deserving player doesn't sit well with me. The fans who voted him in are idiots imo and probably the same fans who don't have a problem with how Bettman is running the NHL (horribly imo).
