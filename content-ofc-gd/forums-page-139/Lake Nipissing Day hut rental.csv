956719,Joeytier,2016-02-08 15:05:00,3990,If you don't mind traveling to the south shore there are lots of options.  Almost all of the operators that offer bungalows also have day huts.  The Waltonian would be my number one pick.

956835,Chuck Enwinde,2016-02-09 05:16:00,247,I'll second Reeds.  They launch out of Sunset Park in North Bay.  I was there in  a bugalow about ten days ago and the fishing was very good for perch and slot walleyes.
