955747,John Bacon,2016-02-02 05:05:00,3277,Maybe build a few these while waiting for some safer ice.  https://www.facebook.com/corey.blank.79/videos/10155239077990156/
955750,wormdunker,2016-02-02 05:57:00,1711,"Awesome idea!  But, I think they're illegal in Ontario."
955758,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-02 08:06:00,8243,"I think it would be legal here Brian, nothing more than a tip up really."
955763,Acountdeleted,2016-02-02 12:47:00,2562,It's like the 'jaw jackers'. It's not spring loaded so you can use it.
955764,Terry,2016-02-02 13:33:00,14456,Yes it is not illegal It is only illegal if there is an external spring to set the hook It uses the rod to set the hook so legal
955781,AKRISONER,2016-02-02 17:49:00,5558,guys were using one of these on island lake last weekend and the CO's were out...no issue...so this is legal for sure.
955784,DanD,2016-02-02 18:31:00,2223,Looks like a decent idea? The way it sets the hook; a dink perch would be slingshot right out the hole and into the white bucket. LOL  Dan.
955785,manitoubass2,2016-02-02 18:34:00,11391,This ????  Thats a bass pro hook set ???

955800,Acountdeleted,2016-02-02 21:59:00,2562,Perch trick shots? Now that's a YouTube video I would watch.
955801,manitoubass2,2016-02-02 22:02:00,11391,"Hahaha, perch billiards!  Jumbo in the corner bucket!"
955815,GBW,2016-02-02 23:05:00,8460,
955816,ecmilley,2016-02-02 23:18:00,2163,add a couple mods and could use it to play mousetrap
955818,misfish,2016-02-02 23:21:00,29133,"First off, nice work whom ever you are. I would add another piece to hold the rod better.  I have never got these things.  IMO,you have to be on aggrisive fish for these things to work. Im not sure about you all, but perch fishing is finnesse fishing.  I would say it would work good for pike, but I still wouldnt use one."
955819,GBW,2016-02-02 23:26:00,8460,"I would have a lower (flatter) than his 45* bend to have less tension on the rod if I was to make one like it. If there is no PCV that can match a lower line angel then raise the wire part up higher is what I would try. I've seen others and I like the idea but, more stuff to haul around at the end of the day too..."
955823,manitoubass2,2016-02-02 23:36:00,11391,"Yes, yes it would!  Also with said rig what would you use for line???  4-6lb mono and its gonna break(or rip lips or both)  10lbs mono is gonna break or rip off a lip  Fluoro is ripping lips  Braid is shooting fish 30ft in the air with the fish in two pieces lol"
955835,SirCranksalot,2016-02-03 00:24:00,3291,I made up a similar version last year but hardly used it at all. Somehow just couldn't be bothered once I got out there sitting (rrelatively) comfortably on my bucket. It would seem to take some of the fun out of it.
955848,GBW,2016-02-03 01:17:00,8460,I would still use a line rated for the rod and fishing style but in the video that looked like a heavy to MH rod but he had a panfish size jig on the line. I think of you load the rod up to 25 or 30% of load before the rig does it's thing it is more than enough and more so when using good and sharp hooks.
956728,Sterling,2016-02-08 16:15:00,477,"Spoke to a CO on Nipissing last year about this and it's quite simple;  If the ROD is tensioned and the device releases the tension in the rod, you're ok.  If any other device acts to set the hook, you're breaking the law!  In other words the device in the video is fine."
