953631,Fish Farmer,2016-01-17 20:30:00,2234,Anyone ever try fixing cracks and holes in their portable FISH hut tubs. Thinking of trying my soldering gun and piece of other plastic to fill in holes.
953635,chris.brock,2016-01-17 21:03:00,4053,"Is it a portable, blow up vinyl tub?  I'd buy a kit.  http://www.softubcanada.com/ca/shop-details/1279/tear-aid-vinyl-repair-kit  hard plastic I would try J B Weld marine epoxy. Never done it, just an idea."
953647,captpierre,2016-01-17 22:41:00,2521,"I'd call a reputable hot tub vendor. I'm sure they deal with this problem often. Should direct you in the right direction. Is it plastic, acrylic, fibreglass. There is heat and  lots of weight involved. Wanna do this right."
953660,Fish Farmer,2016-01-17 23:22:00,2234,"Sorry, I guess I should have said Portable Fish Hut Plastic tub, the bottom of a Clam portable. Black Plastic bottom"
953662,captpierre,2016-01-17 23:24:00,2521,My bad. Read Hot tub.  ?
953668,tedley,2016-01-17 23:40:00,36,I made a patch out of plastic from a molded plastic muffler display sign.and used machine screws and nuts to bolt it on. Then bolted downhill skies to bottom to protect the tub from rubbing on the ground.  
953673,NAW,2016-01-17 23:59:00,4022,"I can think of a few ways.  If you can find a similar plastic material, you could epoxy it on.  Maybe add a couple rivets for good measure.  Make sure you drill the ends of the cracks so they don't get any bigger..  I'm not 100% sure if it's thermoplastic or thermoset material.  If it's thermoset, melting it with a soldering iron won't work.   If it's thermoplastics you should be able to melt it back together, maybe with the addition of some filler material.  But I would use a propane torch, not a soldering iron.  You'll know right away if it's thermoplastic, because the plastic will melt when you heat it and turn liquid.  YouTube it.  I'm sure your find something"
953679,chris.brock,2016-01-18 00:35:00,4053,"My bad. Read Hot tub.  me too, just another hallucination I guess  I would still use 2 part epoxy"
953705,wormdunker,2016-01-18 09:04:00,1711,"Hey Dave - Cut a similar piece of plastic a little larger than the hole.  Use rivets to hold it in place, then apply a quality silicone to seal the edges.  If the plastic is different colors you can name it ""Patches""  LOL!  I have installed a 1/4"" thick piece of aluminum across the front of my plastic sled to save wear & tear such as ice chunks.  I purchased it from a steel fab shop, who in turn bent in on a roller to fit the profile of my sled.  Works great!"
953735,Fish Farmer,2016-01-18 15:48:00,2234,"OK Thanks for your info guys. I tried yesterday with my soldering gun, started with a lid off a Folgers coffee can, (black plastic) worked but slow, May try with my torch or soldering iron. Let you know how I make out, may take a few pictures if it looks professional  ."
953747,Fisherman,2016-01-18 17:19:00,7201,"I'm sure a little while back, someone had to get an ATV fender repaired and was quite happy with the price and outcome of the repair.  Icefisherman had the repair done. Here, http://www.plasticweldingrepairs.ca/"
953806,super dave,2016-01-18 21:06:00,323,"I have the same problem - a couple of holes in the bottom of my Clam Kenai.   I believe the tub is made out of a polyethelyne.   i saw a video on youtube where the guy repaired a large hole in his kayak using the plastic from a javex bottle, which is also made of polyetheylene.   If you look at the bottom of plastic containers they should have the PE 2 symbol.   I'm considering going this route on the smaller hole.  if it works out ok, i'll try on the larger hole.  try looking it up on youtube."
953826,aplumma,2016-01-18 21:48:00,6896,Dave didn't you have some hockey kick boards from your boat bunker project? A few strips might help stop future holes?  Art

954041,Fish Farmer,2016-01-19 19:21:00,2234,"Hope this helps someone else. I guess I could file roughness down but I think the ice and road will do the job. I covered holes I drilled in the past for the runners I had bought that weren't any good, hut filled with water. Was a slow job but it filled the holes and one big hole and crack.        Saw on one site you can use ties as welding rods    "

954163,Fish Farmer,2016-01-20 14:47:00,2234,"Brian sometimes I don't understand myself, that word is in the newf dictionary, Deefidets meaning Deficits.   You're half right Brian, I think we'll all be eating it. Checked the newf dicktionary, I spelt it rong, Deaficets. I think we need another get together."
