955906,AKRISONER,2016-02-03 16:00:00,5558,"Why because I think hip hop is garbage? Or because the NBA isn't the greatest basketball?  My opinion is as good as anyone else's.  by claiming ""hip hop"" isnt real music, you have basically displayed how little you know about the subject matter and music in general.  You dont have to like it, i dont like EDM, country or house music...but they are music and I can appreciate the talent of the individuals making it.   Manitou, i cant say i agree with you referring to ""rap"" either. You are now diving into sub genres. Rather than confusing everyone lets let KRS one provide the definition ""rap is something you do, hip hop is something you live""  we cant confuse the subject matter of one artist as now not being classified as hip hop/rap...many artists that you might listen to were mostly likely highly influenced by artists with said violent/negative subject matter, but that is the essence of music. True good music is a product of its environment, thats why hip-hop for example, that was born on the streets of compton in the mid 1980's is violent in nature. Its groundbreaking and simply a product of the environment. Its not manufactured. Thats how you can easily define good music.  Also please dont make assumptions that because I listen to hip-hop i dont know anything about music."
955928,manitoubass2,2016-02-03 18:30:00,11391,"You got me there.  BUT, rap in the 80's, 90's and early 00's was much different than the rap of today.  In those years many artist were borderline both genres are even crossed back and forth.  Nowadays its a whole different ballgame(unforunately)  But yes your point is taken.  And I agree, us that like or even love hip hop usually listen to alot of other genres as well.  Like I mentioned, I love the travelling wilburies also david lee roth, the scorpions, johnny cash, megadeth, system of the down, herb albert and the tiajuana bass haaha.  Pretty much just love music in general"

HH OK I'll rise to the bait, I understand you are a musician and quite a good one I hear, however, I have shared the stage with : The three tenors, The Nylons, Eugene Levey, Liona Boyd, sung for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, and participated in the world premier of a work by Goresky to name a few of my musical accomplishments. (I have the signed programs to prove this as well.) I say this to give weight to my opinion of Stings artistry. Don't ask because I won't tell. These are over a beer at the pub stories not published on the internet stories."
955766,Headhunter,2016-02-02 13:53:00,5703,"I guess I'll clarify my point. If you have ever been to a Raptors game, you would know that the building is a bee hive of energy. From the constant playing of up-beat music, to the interaction with the fans, the NBA is a fast paced form of entertainment. This is why I have made the comments that I have. Sting is not a high energy, fast paced performer. His solo work is considered among the high brow community to be rock n roll, but in reality, he's the Perry Como of ""modern music. i just don't feel that he is in any way a fit for this gig. Sorry if I have hurt any feelings. HH"

955802,manitoubass2,2016-02-02 22:08:00,11391," But me thinks you might be confusing hip hop and rap???  Hip hop(even if its not your cup o tea) is highly skillful.  A good DJ(a real dj, not that dood that has a playlist at a club) is insanely talented.  And the artists are brilliant with wordplay and storytelling.  Rap is like "" yeah g stacks and stacks of cash/enough to smack your b... a.../  With ghost writers and computerized beats etc  I dont listen to much country, but I sure can respect the skill.  Anyhow the correct answer is the travelling wilburies?"

Now when I think of the NBA and specifically Toronto, the last name I would have come up with is Sting. Looking at the demographics of the NBA, I can't understand how he got the gig! At 66 years old and not having anything in the recent past that resembles a hit, how could he have gotten this gig? Doesn't Toronto have a few world class musicians currently riding a huge wave of popularity? Your thoughts on this? HH"
