We the boys @ SA now have some winter ones for us winter guys. These are fleece lined and are wind proof as well. Was riding my sled for 3 hours packing down trail @ the cabin and was toasty the whole time.

Musta been putting along???  Reminds me of the first time I opened up my 700 and forgot to put my visor down.  Frozen eyeballs in 2.6 seconds  I wouldnt mind a few of those buffs  Yeah not rippin' fer sure. Was packing down trail and rippin' shreds trail. Wind was blowin' pretty good though. A pair of goggles would have been handy.  http://www.sateam.company/frost-tech/
