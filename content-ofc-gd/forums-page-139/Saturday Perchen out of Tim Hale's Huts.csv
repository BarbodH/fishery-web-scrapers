Buddy Cuong hooked into a very nice 13' Perch. then I caught it sister, but I had a very light action rod with no back bone, so the Perch was in charged, and it wrapped up all the lines, and just as I was doing my best Pro Bass lift out the line snapped, and I heard of small voice saying I'm Free I'm Free, and she was gone. finished the day with a nice dinner haul each. Ice was 8' and looken to head back up again but will check with Tims first on the ice"

955671,turtle,2016-02-01 18:46:00,274,"I also fished out of Tim Hales huts with a group of buddies Friday & Saturday this past weekend.  Friday was better size, numbers & a bonus small whitefish with Saturday slower & smaller fish.  No great hauls either day but a good fish fry each night.  Two of the group were first timers on the ice and had a good experience, caught & ate fish.  Only two herring caught & didn't see any schools go through."
955680,Sinker,2016-02-01 20:43:00,8692,"We had a slow but steady bite near you guys. Nothing crazy, but real good size fish. I think we kept 15 between my gf and I, but they were hogs. Our group of 6 had about 70 keepers for the group. I've seen better days, but Im not complaining, we got some real brutes.   S."
955748,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-02 05:09:00,8243,"70 keepers is nothing to poohoo at Sinker. Thick ice, a warm hut and keepers, that I can handle. Walking out on iffy ice and sitting on a bucket with wind whipping up my arse, nope. I'll leave that to you nut bar die hards. You know who you are Dave and Brian."
955752,wormdunker,2016-02-02 06:11:00,1711,"I hear ya Ironmaker!  +2 in Barrie today & I'll be sittin in a heated hut on Simcoe for 2 days!  Woo Hoo!  My buddy has been slayin whities all week walking out on 3"" of ice  - no thanx.  That's a little to thin for me!"
955762,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-02 12:01:00,8243,"The last time I was on Quinte it was a bit over 2"" thick, maybe, unbeknown to me until I got a ear full from a guy 25 feet away as the water came up from his hole as I walked by. Back to shore tout suite."
