956018,ecmilley,2016-02-04 01:43:00,2163,"my money it would be the 600 e tec 2 stroke see lots original km well over 15k and several with over 20 before needing refreshing, with 118hp on tap it will power through slush and deep snow and will give you options on deeper lug tracks, as for overheating thats what studs and scratcher help with, if its low enough to overheat the engine then your damaging the sliders and track clips anyhow, 600 has better resale value as well, skidoo has some sport models that use the older series 3 600 carb best deal on snow not sure if available with the utility sleds. i ride a yamaha apex one of the harder to cool sleds and run near zero snow pack on the lake on regular basis dont have any issues with overheating, always little tricks to cool watter wetter, scratcher, studs nd another trick is to mount a single stud in rear of each ski throws all kinds of ice crystals into the skid"
956019,Joeytier,2016-02-04 01:55:00,3990,600 carb is only available in MXZ/Renegade/Summit but they are a great deal and a proven reliable liquid.
956030,Dara,2016-02-04 03:29:00,3052,You just need to go shopping.  All the sleds are pretty decent nowdays. The 600 ACE is said to be the most fuel efficient engine made. A buddys daughter got one in a Tundra and the dealer said she would be lucky to put a full tank of gas through it all winter. My Vector gets 20 mpg running 70 mph all day long Another guy I work with got the Polaris 550 for fishing and so far he likes it but hasn't been out much. You can adjust the skis narrow or wide depending on what you want to do with it.  The 900 ACE in a Renegade will give you a fishing and trail sled  Price point means a lot too  I may have a 2012 Vector for sale next year

956312,blue pickeral,2016-02-05 19:27:00,267,"Ensure that BRP has fixed the problem with the 550 fan cooled blowing up due to limited compression space in its cylinders. Some dealers were installing an extra wide head gasket and increasing oil flow to compensate for a lean setting developed to meet CAFE averages.  The 600 ACE is a quiet efficient motor not prone to overheating in even thin conditions - ice scratchers should be used in extreme cases, instances of 20,000 miles (not kms) with out any type of trouble are common to this engine. 30 miles per gallon is a spec met by most users on medium weight sleds."
956315,Terry,2016-02-05 19:38:00,14456,thanks for the info
955941,Terry,2016-02-03 20:16:00,14456,"I am thinking about a new 2016 Ski-Doo Tundra LT 550f its light, long track and fan cooled so i dont have to worry about overheating as much as i need to with my liquid cool so that is why I want the 550f and not the 600 ace  4 stroke  so what do you think pros , cons  or maybe just a bad choice, or maybe they dont make them like they use to and its not the machine they were 15 years ago?///"
955947,porkpie,2016-02-03 20:46:00,2521,Bush sleds and ice fishing machines should be LT fans in my opinion.  I don't think you could go wrong with that choice.
955948,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-03 20:48:00,10439,"550F  Cons: poor gas mileage, 2 strokes usually need to be rebuilt much sooner than 4 strokes, use 2 stroke oil, if oil injection pump dies engine seizes.  Pros: 2 strokes are lighter, fan cooled better on hard pack and ice especially in warmer temps, start better in -30+ temps, 2 stoke engines are easier to work on.  600 ACE  Cons: Heavier due to 4 stroke engine, need to change oil and filter like a car, harder starting in -30+ temps (need block heater, batt blanket and plug in), over heat in warm temps and hard pack, glare ice conditions, 4 stroke engines are more difficult to work on.  Pros: Excellent gas mileage, no oil injection pump to worry about, are quieter and don't smell like a 2 stroke, very good low end torque and smooth power through whole throttle range, much longer time between engine rebuilds.  For warm weather running with a liquid cooled sled install a set of these (http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/eshop/detail.php?sectionId=AC&groupId=19&subGroupId=34&categoryId=105&itemId=2253&unitId=2174&unitName=2008%2BRS%2BVenture%2BGT&unitGroup=SM&unitYear=2008&items_per_page=12&page=8) and the problem is reduced to almost nothing."
955950,misfish,2016-02-03 20:51:00,29133,Have you been outside today ? I was looking at choppers today.
955952,Terry,2016-02-03 21:01:00,14456,thanks i want the fan cooled for all the pro reasons you gave I want to be able to run the side of the road to the lake and the liquid cools over heat on me you cant even  buy a pull start for the 600 ace  oh  so many decisions to make lol
955956,AKRISONER,2016-02-03 21:14:00,5558,"major benefit of 2 stroke over 4 is the ability to single handedly move the thing when you get stuck (which you will)  You wouldnt believe some of the situations you will find yourself in lol  if you always will be riding with a partner then whatever, but if you are trekking through the bush along, go 2 stroke."
955960,Joeytier,2016-02-03 21:29:00,3990," This is pretty much bang on, however those 550 fans don't pop nearly as much as the more powerful liquid cooled motors, you should expect at least 10 k out of a top end on those 550's.  I just bought a '16 Polaris Indy voyager 144 550. It is very comparable to the tundra Lt, but the major pitfall of the tundra for me is the pogo stick suspension. It gives you a much narrower ski stance making the machine very tippy and not as nice to ride as a machine with conventional a-arm suspension. It is only really beneficial to people running tight bush trails and traplines. Take a look at the Skidoo Expedition Sport 550, its basically a tundra with an a-arm front suspension, same off trail performance, or the Indy voyager 144 or the 155 (155 has floater skis and articulating rear suspension). Yesterday I pulled 3 guys and all our gear thru a fairly messy bush trail and across a lake with 2 ft of slush like it wasn't even there."
955961,Terry,2016-02-03 21:40:00,14456,the looks good  Skidoo Expedition Sport 550 is interesting too
955965,Big Cliff,2016-02-03 21:47:00,6899,I would be going with the two stroke air cooled personally! I think Drifter did a really good job of summing it up!
955966,Joeytier,2016-02-03 21:49:00,3990,"The voyager is the most bare bones work sled on the market, and the price is unbeatable.  It wont pull quite as much as a skandic or bearcat but its way more nimble and capable in deep snow, my 144 only weighs about 430 lbs without the battery in it (very easy to crank over cold)."
955968,Terry,2016-02-03 21:56:00,14456,thanks lots to consider here
955984,Sinker,2016-02-03 22:43:00,8692,I like the yamaha ventures.
955987,Joeytier,2016-02-03 22:55:00,3990,Ventures are awesome so long as you're not doing any serious offtrail.  They're fine until you have slow down lol.  I was riding with a venture 700 the other day...unbelievable trail rider.
955988,Sharkbait22,2016-02-03 23:20:00,297,"Take a look at the Skidoo Expedition Sport 550, its basically a tundra with an a-arm front suspension.  The Expo is the one.  Remove the second seat when not needed.  The 600 ACE is very nice. I think you will want scratchers whether fan or liquid cooled when there is little snow.  I have them for my fan sled because the sliders will melt without snow.  I have the spring style, 90% of the time you won't need them.  Stud the track.  You'll want them to generate some ice dust, stop, and get going when needed.

955995,chris.brock,2016-02-04 00:12:00,4053,"I think the Bombardier stuff is better now than it has ever been.  It's a shame nobody makes a simple, light, 340/ 440  long track, ice fishing, bush sled anymore. Huge suspension, big horsepower and electric start aren't necessary in a utility sled.  I would go fan for sure and compare the Polaris versus the Ski Doo. I like Yamaha but I don't like their current models as an ice fishing sled."

The EPA has got the North American small engine market by the balls.  I can guarantee you the 550 fan won't be around for many more years.  It is old, reliable technology, but smokes like a chimney and plows through the fuel.  I love mine, but a modern EFI 600 cc two stroke with twice the power will get around twice the fuel economy.  Same reason you can't buy 2stroke outboards under 15 hp anymore (even the small evinrudes are 4stroke)"

It is a niche market but the market exists."
