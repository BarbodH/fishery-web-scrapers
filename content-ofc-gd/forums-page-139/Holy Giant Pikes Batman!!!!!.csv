955864,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-03 02:49:00,10439,Baltic Sea? A Saltwater Pike???  Yep.  Biggest pike in the world come from there. They stay in the brackish areas during the winter but in warmer water will actually head into the ocean proper.

956072,mepps,2016-02-04 16:14:00,1301,A beast for sure - I've read posts claiming it was from at least 5 different lakes. Many sources say its Lac Maggiore in Italy.
