You know it O I,  the sun was actually out for the first time in what seemed like months, had to clean the dust off the sunglasses, was a beautiful day only 8 kph north east winds, temp was approx -32 wc  The only thing she ever says when she hooks up to a fish is ""YEP"" , thats when you know she is ROCKIN AND REELING   I asked her that day do u want to take the pop up out, she replied no its not that bad out, I am a lucky man"

Can't complain about that Hey Lucas, your absolutely correct, sure cant get the deals like you do for pork bellies, ribs etc but freshly caught  trout for dinner is not too bad either, had some last night with a salad and veggies mmmmgood"
