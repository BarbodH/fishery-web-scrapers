Now the chimney at our city home was going to need work according to the sweep we use and who used to do WETT certifications. Got another guy  to have a look and he confirmed first guy's deco.

It is getting more difficult to get fire insurance on homes with certified woodburning units. Some providers just will not insure any places with wood burning appliances. This came to light 12 years ago when I helped on a new build in town and plans were to build a gorgeous fireplace with an insert, no broker could find an insurer to cover a new build. Most of the guys I know that have woodburners in their shops are not insured for fire. That makes burning wood very expensive if a fire did happen. I have seen some that are a fire hazard waiting to burn the building down around it. Guy gets a new stove old stove goes into the shop. I think we have seen or done it perhaps.  I personally think it is a problem in areas of high density. Even out here at the lake. We had a nut bar neighbour once that would burn anything that grew out of the ground. He liked spruce and pine best. My wife has asyma(sic) when black smoke was billowing out his chimney and the wind was blowing from the west it really bothered her and that's only from 1 residence a few hundred feet away. Imagine an entire neighbourhood in the city burning wood. The neighbour moved. Long story, happy ending, for the neighbourhood. This guy gets a entire chapter in my book. OK I have to tell you one. He moves in and I remind him to take his stairs up before he heads south, I'll help. Nope not required he tells me, he's an engineer and nothing will move those stairs based on his research of wind and water levels here, Erie. OK. Of course the first October Gale the stairs go for a swim. They end up on my breakwall 30 feet from shore and 20 feet up the hill.. There's a knock on the door and 2 OPP are standing on my deck. He insists I stole his 15foot section of stairs because they are smashed to smithereens on my property. The cops let me off with a warning."

Not sure how bad it is in Montreal but Fairbanks looks like China during the winter. Yup I'd imagine it is Dave.  More of a remote location than Montreal though - and a long history of being more dependent on natural resources for survival than the average urban dweller.  American too, though not sure that's a big impact.  Like I said, I can see some of what the restriction is about, I don't agree with it being top on the list to go after but I can see why they are - it's just simply the easiest in spite of how incredibly silly they may end up looking- think long gun registry and all it's GOOD intentions being pursued, no matter what the cost was... And I'm sure every one of the businesses that will be putting in the new style stoves has lined up to complain about it too... I'm also sure government  sanity will appear one day - ain't got a whole lotta hope I'll still be kickin' when it does though!  Michael"
955285,Rod Caster,2016-01-29 00:33:00,5784,"Good call Mike, I thought the same thing... burning wood in a dense city is not a great idea. I'd assume that if you live in Montreal, you've already forfeited the self-sustaining lifestyle. First of all, hardly anyone (or no-one) in montreal likely has a woodlot large enough to actually be self-sustaining. Getting pre-split firewood delivered to your urban asphalt driveway is hardly self-sustaining haha.  Those outdoor wood furnaces can be brutal for neighbors too, the chimney's are low and they can burn some nasty fuel (soppy wood or dead bodies).  During a temperature inversion, I would not want to live down-wind of an outdoor furnace as buddy throws in 4 foot stumps."
955301,pics,2016-01-29 02:29:00,1268,"My insert is used daily all winter to supplement my heating and this year it has pretty much rendered my furnace useless . Being a high efficiency unit really stretches my wood supply. If you have blue smoke coming out the chimney then you aren't fully burning the wood. To make it worthwhile for me to heat my house I need the maximum number of BTUs out of the wood. In an urban area it would be foolish to heat with an inefficient stove because there are just too many people that would complain... once up to temperature a high efficiency has almost zero smoke, you can't even tell anything is burning.."
955306,SirCranksalot,2016-01-29 02:50:00,3291,The last I heard of this story was that older existing stoves were being 'grandfathered in' and didn't need to comply with the latest standards.

It has a very low density of energy and unless you can cut your own, it can be pretty expensive to buy, move, and store in the city.  Also, qc electrical rates are low enough that with a low cost heat pump system you can heat for cheaper than you can with natural gas in Ontario. "
955376,JoePa,2016-01-29 19:19:00,179,Like so many other things there are two sides to this issue - I've been burning wood since the 70s - I live in the country and have my own wood so it is a nice way to heat my home during the winter - three years ago I got a new stove - one of those low air use and very clean burning - it actually burns the smoke so has very little smoke - if any - living in the country makes a big difference - I don't have any close neighbors  My son lives in a developed area and  told me about  some guy who put in one of those outdoor furnaces - the prevailing wind blew the smoke across some neighbors house and just about smoked the neighbor out - the neighbor went to court and was successful in stopping the guy from using the furnace  So it depends - I could see some restrictions on burning wood if you live in a city where there are close neighbors - moral of the story - don't live in a city

He said the guys who do it as a BUSINESS have to pay taxes, meaning not all burned wood is tax free.  The whole post is about burning in the downtown core of Montreal - so there's probably few if any private harvestable woodlots to be utilized there (tongue in cheek), suggesting that wood comes from commercial interests.  Besides all that - the article was more towards the appliance side - meaning a certain type of wood burning stove was required in order to be allowed usage in Montreal, not about the wood fuel itself.  Taxes on the up to 9 grand suggested in the article for the appliance retrofit sure would be a chunk more than a bush cord or two of wood a season.  Michael"

We were ready to get it rebuilt, but then started reading about this stuff and now we don't know if it makes any sense having it rebuilt to meet current regulations. What troubles me is the previous owners had it inspected two years ago and they were using it until the sale but the inspector this time works for a company which just happens to specialize in rebuilding fireplaces and chimneys and he failed it.   Should we just repair the minor defects and have it reinspected by another individual? I'm thinking this inspector fails fireplaces to generate revenue for his company. He says it needs a complete rebuild, but I disagree. Needs a new chimney liner, rain cap needs to be thicker, stone on the bottom needs to be extended 4"", and some other minor stuff I can do myself. I just don't see how it's been fine for 50 years and now suddenly it's completely unsafe to use?"

I tried to tell him what was going on, but he knew everything there is to know about this stuff, so I just told him to take his quote and burn it.  We're up an running now, its great.  S."
