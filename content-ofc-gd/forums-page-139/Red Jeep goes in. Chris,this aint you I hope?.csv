955473,huzzsaba,2016-01-30 15:05:00,884,That's where Im going in less than a week.   How thick was the ice?  How do the operators get their guys to the huts?  Or is it walk to your own hut type of arrangement lol.

955706,misfish,2016-02-01 23:28:00,29133,"Bad landing, but cool pic of the lift ."
955731,irishfield,2016-02-02 01:19:00,26272,"He was going cross country and got into icing conditions. With his wings loading up with ice he had no choice, either land or be landed! He broke threw the slush crust into 18"" of surface water. Got off pretty lucky, other than the helicopter recovery it will cost him a prop, engine tear down and a lower cowling. Thankfully it never went over on its back."
955732,pike slayer,2016-02-02 01:49:00,1177,Buddy is lucky he had a jeep. Just pull the carpet to dry and the drain plugs but Geez what an idiot going out there.
