955673,icefisherman,2016-02-01 19:22:00,952," This works great for aggressive tires and those with directional tread as most are designed to dig down through soft material to reach solid ground for traction. This is exactly what you don't want when riding in snow or sand. You need a tread design which propels you forwards rather than digging. The Big Horn 2.0's are awesome all around tires and propel more than dig.   Tires are by far the most important factor on an ATV. It's ludicrous to suggest certain tires don't give a huge advantage over others. There's a reason why some guys can rip around everywhere in deep snow without getting stuck while others sharing your opinion get stuck in every drift or slush pocket around.   Yep. But, this only works with tires that have directional tread and is a complete waste of time doing so with unidirectional tread.   My lord, please do not take anymore advice from whoever told you the smaller front tires are a mismatch as 95% of ATV's sold will have a narrower front tire. Why? The narrower front tires are easier for the machine to push through material which then creates a tire track for the wider rears to follow which makes it easier to get around. Narrower front tires are also much easier to steer and provide better handling.  However, some people will switch to skinny/skinny or wide/wide combinations rather than the standard skinny front/wide rear configuration.  skinny/skinny - mudders do this as it makes it easier for the tires to dig down to solid ground for traction wide/wide - sand/powder snow as it provides better flotation skinny front/wide rear - best overall performance   Stock tires are a joke and are best for those who ride paved trails  OK, so do you recommend changing my current tires with say: Duro Power Grips Radials 26x9xR12 - front and 26x11xR12 - rear ? On original rims....  Considering the way I'll be using the ATV - i.e. mostly ice fishing and limited hunting.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
955746,vance,2016-02-02 04:50:00,719,The whole tire size thing boils down to different sizes have different diameters.Your atv was designed with certain tires sizes to match the front and rear gear ratios. If the front and rears dont match one will be be trying to go ether faster or slow than the other. this puts strain on the drive line and extra wear on the tires.Snow and ice thats not much of a problem but on hard gravel and pavement it is a real tire killer.  vance

955827,G.mech,2016-02-02 23:53:00,830,"The stock front and rear tires on Yamaha's (and most others) are the same height front to back.  Yamaha ATVs are almost all 25x8x12 front and 25x10x12 rear from the factory, in fact even the Rhino UTV tires fit a 350 Grizz.  The first number is the height in inches, the second number is the tread width, and the third number is the rim diameter.  The key is that you don't want to change the front to rear tire height or it will cause stress on your machine when in 4WD especially on hard surfaces.  If you go to 26's on the back, go to 26's on the front.  You can play with widths a bit too but the machines are intended to have a slightly narrower tread on the front than on the rear.  They can get crazy at high speeds with wider tires on the front as they don't steer properly (this is the alleged cause of a fatality in Flamborough this winter)."

Cheers, Ice Fisherman  Tire diameter, width and weight are huge factors when deciding on rubber. I have 26 Mud Lite XTR on my 700, but they're radials which makes them heavier and give better traction due to increased footprint over non radial. This means the machine needs to work harder to turn them and clutch mods bring back the power. There is a noticeable difference going from light 6 ply tires like Zilla's to the heavy XTR's even though the diameter is the same. You can't beat the XTR's for overall traction and they wear like iron. Plus because of they're stiff sidewall you can run them at 1-2 psi on the ice for better ice traction and the bead is super hard so no worries of popping a bead at low psi. I have fun them at 0 psi with no issues. You definitely get what you pay for with them and they're worth every penny.  Just changing the clutch weights to lighter ones will shorten the curve to increase low end torque, but you'll lose some top speed. 20 gram (stock) to 18 gram my top speed dropped from 107 km/h to 100 km/h and 16 gram took it down in the low 90's I believe, but wheelies were super easy and the trail riding was great as it accelerated so quickly. It's super easy and less than two hours to change the weights and deglaze the clutch. Add an hour if you're messing with the springs and shims.   I used my Tread Doctor on the XTR's to recut the treads after putting 5000 kms on them and should get another 3000 kms or more. With the XTR's and tread doctor you'll get 2-3 the life of cheap or even just 6 ply tires."
954958,icefisherman,2016-01-26 15:39:00,952,"What else does one do while waiting for some driveable ice on Simcoe? Spends money on his ATV to make it more ice fishing friendly ha ha ;-)  Anyhow...have a tire/wheel related question for my 2010 Grizzly 700 FI EPS Camo version.  Bought it used a month ago and it came with the following tires:  New Dunlop 25x8-12 in the front and ITP Mudlites 25x12-12 with plenty of tread left at the back.  It also came with stock black aluminum wheels. Not sure if I can keep the original wheels, or should I buy new wheel/tires combo? Front wheels have some dings on them and just had to take the front right one for repair, as it was leaking air from the valve and the rim (I was told).  Main use will be for ice fishing (couple months a year) and also a week of deer hunting each fall. All of that in SW Ontario. I'll never be running it in mud, rocks, mountains, etc. extreme terrain. Would like to go up in size (without getting too crazy) mainly for better clearance on the ice/in deeper snow. Do NOT want to make any clutch or similar modifications because of changing the tires.  Another key thing is....right now I am able to load the Grizzly in the bed of my F150 with 6'6"" box and can still close the tailgate. No one could believe it! Like to keep it that way after the tire upgrade. Therefore whatever bigger size tires I buy it must still fit in the truck's bed the same way.  Can use some advise from ATV/Grizzly owners here.

The stock tires that came on my Suzuki were used on the ice a few times but chains sure would have been nice. Two of the younger bunch way up sized their tires and have broken just about everything that they could break,if you up size dont go more than one size.My stock tires where replaced at 6,000 k and still had tread left and worked okay. If you do replace tire go to radials like I did as you get a better ride and traction. From what I have been told after market rims have a different offset and should be replaced a set of four.

955136,G.mech,2016-01-27 19:48:00,830,If you're going to be on the ice and don't like chains these work great:  http://www.gripstuds.com/ATV.php  I bought a cheap used set of stock tires and studded them with only about 30-40 #1300 studs per tire and they are amazing on bare ice.  In really deep snow once you're bottoming out I'm not sure it matters much which tire you have as the tires are usually off the ground anyway.  In middle depth snow they grab the ice underneath and push you through pretty nicely.   These will chew the crap out of concrete and asphalt though so you can't run them on your driveway....I just run these for ice fishing.
955173,vance,2016-01-27 23:39:00,719,"The few times that I have been on the ice whether towing a trailer or not I have found it is how deep the snow is the limiting factor. You can only push so much snow,eventually your tires are not touching the ice (high siding). We were at a hunting camp a few years back ice fishing and it snowed heavily while we were there,we had a half a kilometer to get back to the main snowmobile track on the lake.. Luckily we were eventually able to make a trail (4 hrs) and the guy with the sled towed each of us out to the trail. On ice i am sure it doesnt really matter radial or not traction is limited,studs would have helped but you wouldnt like what they would do to the bed of your truck !! I run Black Diamonds but never have run them in the snow but I dont see any reason why they would any better in the snow as all atv tires are not winter rated. I really dont think you can go wrong with most tires but you have to consider the tread pattern for where you are riding. I ride a wide variety of trails gravel-sand - shallow mud - rocky and I got a good deal. They have a fairly heavy lug pattern which is great on the rears but on hard packed and paved roads in gives a real buzz to the handle bars. Most of the time I dont run 4x4 as they will go thru most stuff except those muddy water holes 2wd.My experience is cheap doesnt last, my black diamonds have 7,000 k on them and I am sure I can get another 3-4 k out of them this summer.  vance"
