956592,Rod Caster,2016-02-07 13:54:00,5784,"JoeyT and I escaped for the day, starting at 530am and ending at 530pm. I haven't been out much this year due to work and family fun, so I was especially looking forward to this.  Gotta love living in the country; I was able to sled right from my doorstep to the lake.  The morning bite was crazy until 10am, it then slowed down for the rest of the day, so we made a few fires and drilled a few holes looking for big ones.  No big ones found but we got our limits of 5 each! I don't think I've ever done that lake spec fishing before.    Spec fingers! kind of like jazz hands.       "
