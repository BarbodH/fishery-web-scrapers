884083,paul_614,2014-11-30 17:07:00,168,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjSMfaUkoaw Just do a search for smitty sled plans
884095,Fang,2014-11-30 19:11:00,1330,Value Village or Salvation Army stores are good starts to pick up cheap used skis
884096,Fisherman,2014-11-30 19:27:00,7201,Here's another that allows leaving the flip over hut attached to the Smitty Sled. http://www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=261490.140
