882525,Fisherman,2014-11-23 02:49:00,7201,Little bit more weight on the wheels.
882546,Terry,2014-11-23 11:27:00,14456,The back ski on it broke so it was very hard to keep it strait up. And it was meant to tow me but it was the easiest way to hold it that day.  But still more weight wouldn't hurt.
882584,Moosebunk,2014-11-23 16:36:00,3970,My Lord that's too funny Terry!  You're a nut.
882592,JoshS,2014-11-23 17:12:00,729,Nice sled! Looks like it'll cruise smoothly. Let us know how it makes out. I gotta put some ski's on mine
882593,Terry,2014-11-23 17:21:00,14456,My Lord that's too funny Terry!  You're a nut. I'm still trying to figure out where my legs went
882595,irishfield,2014-11-23 17:28:00,26272,He has always been an Eddie Murphy fan...
882596,Terry,2014-11-23 17:29:00,14456,lol exactly
882597,misfish,2014-11-23 17:32:00,29133,"Little bit more weight on the wheels.   Im thinking this for weight.  Remove the rubber from the rims. Weld two 1"" thick plates to the rims. ( there will be a hole in the middle of the plate to allow wheel change) and then put the rubber back on, but use inner tubes. Fiill the tires up with foam."
882602,Fisherman,2014-11-23 18:08:00,7201,"How about welding on a couple of 12 inch circular saw blades,  that'll give ya some traction.."
882603,misfish,2014-11-23 18:12:00,29133,"How about welding on a couple of 12 inch circular saw blades,  that'll give ya some traction..  LOL  And they could work as a fish slicer too."
884234,Terry,2014-12-01 20:28:00,14456,here is what I have for mine so far simple design  a frame with wheels  and wood on the skis for the wheels to fit into      
884236,misfish,2014-12-01 20:32:00,29133,How are the wheels locked in?  That sure is an interesting design. Did Wayne help you with this?
884238,Terry,2014-12-01 20:42:00,14456,a strip of metal on both hunks of wood to hold the wheels in  I thunk it me self bye  it seemed to be simple and functional
884240,misfish,2014-12-01 20:45:00,29133,"I bye,she be just ducky."
884270,Sinker,2014-12-02 00:38:00,8692,Simple and effective....thats my style!  S.
882397,misfish,2014-11-22 17:16:00,29133,"Been dabbling away on this for a month or so. Little bit here and there. No real rush to get it finished, but will be complete by the time first ice gets here.  I had a Polar express flip that the tarp got eaten by moles. So I trashed that and the metal frame and kept the boggan .  Here,s the start and at the 80% finished product so far. It will travel on snow and road.  Wheels lock up out of the way when traveling the snow and ice.     And can be locked in for road travel as not to wear the sliders.       At first I was going to make it in two pieces so it would be  higher up off the snow,but rethought that and said to self,do you really want to be screwing around with that when it,s cold and windy? Just throw it in the back of the darn truck and be gone.LOL           I learned this way of hooking up the pull rope from my pop. The skis act like a spring and will allow the smitty to just hop up on rougher snow and act like a shock absorber.     Enough clearance for pulling on the road.       Fits just nice.     My plan is to put a hard top cover on it,but rethinking that now. May just buy the boggan canvas cover. Still on the fence about this.  Thats it for now  To be continued,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
882400,Terry,2014-11-22 17:21:00,14456,how high off the ground is the thing
882401,davey buoy,2014-11-22 17:27:00,5505,"Looking good,would love to have the clearance in the suv for something like that. My tools fill her up pretty good lol.What's the overall weight Brian?"
882402,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-22 17:31:00,2582,I really like your tying on of the pull ropes Brian...I might steal that idea   Your construction looks sound...I wish I had the same stuff handy to myself. Obviously I don't know how heavy it is just by looking at the pictures....but the pictures leave me with the feeling that you might have some problems with it tipping over on a windy day. Give us all another report after it gets out on the lake!
882405,wkrp,2014-11-22 17:35:00,656,Great handywork!
882406,Terry,2014-11-22 17:36:00,14456,I too thought how high it was and how narrow between the skis it might be tippy but hard to say till I see it in person
882411,misfish,2014-11-22 17:48:00,29133,"It,s 22 inches wide and there is 12 inches from the skis to the bottom of the boggan. Once the hub/tackle/auger are on it,it should be stable enough.  I can see where you are coming from Steve. Modifying it will be easy. Wider might be a good thing to think about now before later. Thanks for you input."
882414,misfish,2014-11-22 18:01:00,29133," Not sure Dave,but I can lift it up on the truck with one arm."
882416,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-22 18:03:00,2582,Only 12 inches from the skis to the bottom of the tub...wow...in the pictures it looks like a lot more Brian. After getting a better height perspective I really don't think you will have a problem. Give it a workout this winter and tweak whatever your not happy with.  Regardless thx for sharing your build with us all. I really enjoy these Macgyver posts
882417,misfish,2014-11-22 18:06:00,29133,I used the cell phone for the pics. Thats probly the reason.
882418,irishfield,2014-11-22 18:11:00,26272,I gotta drop by behind the plant and check out that scrap bin!! LOL
882423,misfish,2014-11-22 18:21:00,29133,"I gotta drop by behind the plant and check out that scrap bin!! LOL  Was waiting for that one. LOL  All material bought and paid for this time (I got a great deal from Ontario Steel, my nascar buddy). Well, I did borrow the screws.LMAO"
882426,Terry,2014-11-22 18:30:00,14456,"oh, I thought it looked higher too it should be fine"
882445,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-22 20:47:00,956,That's cool
882447,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 20:49:00,1814,Now that is pretty slick Brian! My only thought is the wheel size/clearance enough on messy roads to roll well.  Where did you get the aluminum angles? How thick is the material? It looks pretty beefy. I have been looking for stuff like that for a boat project I have in mind for the spring.
882455,misfish,2014-11-22 21:18:00,29133,"Now that is pretty slick Brian! My only thought is the wheel size/clearance enough on messy roads to roll well.  Where did you get the aluminum angles? How thick is the material? It looks pretty beefy. I have been looking for stuff like that for a boat project I have in mind for the spring.  Thanks Pete  If the roads are messy,then I will just use the sliders. The wheels are for bare pavement.  The angles are cut from a 12 inch piece 2""x2"" x 1/4"" aluminum angle. The tubing is 1"" sq x 1/8"" thick.  All made from 1, 10' ft piece.  Like I said,got a good deal from a buddy. Nice to have connections for this kind of stuff.  If your looking for a deal on material Pete, let me know."
882458,Rustic-Fisher,2014-11-22 21:39:00,826,"Nice work Brian, Your like a mad scientist when it comes to fishing lol"
882464,Moosebunk,2014-11-22 21:46:00,3970,Who's Smitty?  And how you pulling this beast around?  Aren't you old? lol.
882465,misfish,2014-11-22 22:01:00,29133,"Who's Smitty?  And how you pulling this beast around?  Aren't you old? lol.  Good question Drew. I have searched, but cant seem to find anything that is related. History wise.  As for your other question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I,ll pm my answer. LOL  Hey Ry, 4 days off coming soon. Blast and cast? Looking at the graph. Looks like blast only."
882469,Rustic-Fisher,2014-11-22 22:17:00,826,Coyotes ..... It's that time again !  Dropped one today with the 223 @ 175yrds But could of use a wingman.

882471,Terry,2014-11-22 22:39:00,14456,if your too old this can pull it     
882472,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 22:43:00,1814,Will do Brian! Thanks
882478,misfish,2014-11-22 22:54:00,29133,if your too old this can pull it       Working on some improvements for that.
882482,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:06:00,26272,The things you old guys do for s and giggles !
