884416,solopaddler,2014-12-03 02:23:00,8605,Great stuff Trev!  I'll assume some of those pic's are from your new place? Looks like you're figuring things out pretty well. Love the new dog! Speaking from experience I'll bet he's a bundle of energy. (Glad to see you put the powerful mojo attached to that rain suit to good use  )
884422,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-03 02:59:00,956,Nice variety.  Good year for you.
884471,Rich Clemens,2014-12-03 10:12:00,3131,Looks like you guys got just about one of everything this year.  Great season.
884525,trevy727,2014-12-03 19:12:00,351,"Yes Mike, some pics are from the new place. Figuring out the water just fine. As for our puppy, his name is Louie and we absolutely love him. He's 10 months old and spoiled rotten. The rain suit is awesome for warmer weather. It's definitely something I was missing."
884530,fishindevil,2014-12-03 19:28:00,6254,Awesome year of fishing for sure !!!! Thanks for sharing I have to do my year report & pics too !!!!  Fish-on !!!!!
884543,Moosebunk,2014-12-03 20:10:00,3970,"Some incredible fish this year Trev.  Seriously... Love the muskies and specks most but man, there's a tonne of goodies in this one.  Best to ya in 2015."
884552,msp,2014-12-03 20:45:00,1336,Well done. Looks like you had a great season. Some much needed porn for a cold day
884587,misfish,2014-12-03 22:54:00,29133,Nice collection of fish there.  You had me with this one though.  
884715,trevy727,2014-12-04 15:27:00,351,Definitely my best catch of 2014.
884752,solopaddler,2014-12-04 20:52:00,8605,"As for our puppy, his name is Louie and we absolutely love him. He's 10 months old and spoiled rotten.   My favourite breed, but the puppy stage can be tough. IMO it was more difficult than raising a child LOL! Daily excercise is key so it's a big commitment in time.  Just a beautiful pup!"
884820,Tim Mills,2014-12-05 01:00:00,476,"What a great season you and your family had, congrats."
884836,Rod Caster,2014-12-05 03:04:00,5784,Wow! Quite the season. Great post.
