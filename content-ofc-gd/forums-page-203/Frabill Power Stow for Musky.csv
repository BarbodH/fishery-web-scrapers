Seems like a good price, but the price also seems to have gone up. I needed this net in the summer but a lot of places were out of stock. Got the power catch instead.  "

884277,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-02 01:08:00,10439,No free shipping to Canada with Cabelas only the lower 48 states. I have shifted most of my purchasing to BPS as their free shipping deals include Canada and only charge $3.50 for brokerage fees.
884278,Dan668,2014-12-02 01:13:00,1120,I got free shipping.  I just ordered it for a friend as a gift. Used code 99blkfri. Its the canadian site. Came out to $192Cad after tax.
884279,Pigeontroller,2014-12-02 01:19:00,2793,Terrible mesh IMO. Tough on the fins...

884281,Dan668,2014-12-02 01:21:00,1120,I know. Ill advise him to buy the power catch mesh as i believe it fits on.  Hes been looking for a foldable net.  Not much else out there.
884284,Roy,2014-12-02 01:48:00,13728,"Maybe I'm wrong but when you're fishing alone (especially). you need your net to be ready. So, why would a storable net be more useful?"
884285,Dan668,2014-12-02 02:00:00,1120,I use the power catch which is great and imo the best net for skis.  He has a smaller boat so prefers the foldable to save space.

I have one and keep it open when fishing by myself,and have it stowed otherwise.   It does save a lot of space.  Also easier for travel and storage in general. Haven't seen any issues with fins.  It's a finer mesh for sure, but very soft with smaller holes, and super deep (almost comedically so).  I don't get how it would cut fins, to be honest.  It does tangle with hooks a lot more than the larger/thicker mesh though.  "
884299,PBenson,2014-12-02 04:57:00,154,Great net.
884381,Pigeontroller,2014-12-02 22:25:00,2793,"All nets split fins on Muskies, some worse than others, not the end of the world as they heal...you'll notice split and bleeding fins in a lot of Muskie pics..."
884428,landry,2014-12-03 03:19:00,1005,I have owned both nets. The power stow mesh tangles too much and prongs fish handling. We hated it. The power catch mesh is far better.
884436,cram,2014-12-03 03:57:00,1733,The tangle is a terrible mess. I just cut the hooks every time (except for spinnerbaits).
