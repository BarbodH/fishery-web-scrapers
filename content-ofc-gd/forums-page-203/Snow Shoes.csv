Last winter saw too much snow to go trekking into a family cottage, looking for grouse on some family land, or even looking for rabbit along fence rows in fields.I have only used a set once before ... I think they were Fabers.  I have line on a set from TSC ...make is ... I think Yanes.I might get to use them 3 or 5 times each winter and likely not much more than 1 to 3 hours at a time.  Anyone do much snow shoeing?Any insight as to what to look for?Entropy  "

I am 5'8"" and approx. 165lbs. Never used snowshoes before so we will see how it goes this season.I also just bought my 12yo daughter a pair of MSR Shift 7X20"" (she is about 70lbs) so we can trek around together.I don't know if it matters to you but there are some NA manufactured snowshoes around, and also lots made off shore. Faber and GV are made in Quebec, MSR are made in USA............. Atlas, Tubbs, Luis Garneau, Yukon Charlies, are all made in China.Burt"

Icy and hills you want the crampons/cleats underneath.  I use MSR Denali Clasics and a newer version.  They are great for harder packed snow, climbing hiils and ice but not so good in deep powder snow.  There are also the aluminum frame with decking and the traditional wood and gut decking types."
