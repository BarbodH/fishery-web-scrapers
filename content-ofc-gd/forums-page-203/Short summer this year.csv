884451,Joey,2014-12-03 04:50:00,9122,Apparently Flickr has changed their photo uploads.   I'll try again.

884491,Joey,2014-12-03 15:13:00,9122,"Ya, I can't figure out this ""cloud"" thing either, drives me nuts.  They keep changing the way you can post pics.  I did a whole report on my year of pics and it didn't work, took me almost an hour to do and then nothing showed up.  Frustrating to say the least"
884492,BillM,2014-12-03 15:14:00,17367,"Joey, just use the BBCode links in Flickr, it should work without issue."
884526,Joey,2014-12-03 19:14:00,9122,"Okay, I'll try again in a new post!  Thanks Bill"
