884255,Roy,2014-12-01 22:57:00,13728,You did good me Brudder. You're right about the fast first fish. There are exceptions though.
884257,davey buoy,2014-12-01 23:03:00,5505,Sounds like a heck of a good place to work  .You did well as Roy said.Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
884269,Ralph Field,2014-12-02 00:26:00,1018,Great fish ! Usually if I'm fortunate enough to hook up and land a fish on the first drift then my luck mirrors yours.
884291,MJL,2014-12-02 03:26:00,2427,Nice fish Brian  Methinks the fishies got violated the day before...
884296,BillM,2014-12-02 03:53:00,17367,Nice fish Brian  Methinks the fishies got violated the day before...  I hope you were gentle.
884300,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-02 05:23:00,8243,"Great fish. You guys are right about a fast hook up. First of 4 lines set out on Erie, bam 9 pound eye. Next 4 hours burn gas and oil. It will drive you off the deep end. Next day nothing for 4 hours, pulling riggers bam, you guessed it, nice eye on lead core, but only 1. Burned money for another hour, not even a farm animal.  Why do we torcher ourselves asks my dear woman? Because I love it,,,,,,almost as much as I do you."
884716,Beans,2014-12-04 15:32:00,3339,"The maddening thing about getting the first one right quick is thinking they must be on fire...I'll let this one go and keep a couple later for a feed...Then, later never happens...LOL!"
884726,manitoubass2,2014-12-04 17:20:00,11391,funny cause it's sooooo true
884735,Musky or Specks,2014-12-04 18:34:00,2710,same with musky fishing for me. I get one in the first couple minutes....usually means the rest of the day will suck....so you try to convince yourself you are happy you got one! I'm soo glad this isn't only me.
884736,manjo39,2014-12-04 18:45:00,354,"It happened to me twice on the lake this past summer.  First cast, 5 pound bass.  I headed back for breakfast shortly after."
884744,AKRISONER,2014-12-04 19:38:00,5558,"literally 3 of my personal best fish were caught first cast. Seems that when you find a fish, it will hit every time.  Ive even made a trip out, caught a personal best pike first cast...and then headed in because the weather was so terrible that I had accomplished what I had set out to do."
