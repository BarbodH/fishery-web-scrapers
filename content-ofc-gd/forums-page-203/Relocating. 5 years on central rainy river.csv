879192,manitoubass2,2014-11-02 20:56:00,11391,"Well,today is a bittersweet day. Because of new to me work, today was the last few casts I took here as a resident. I layed down tobacco, said a prayer and thanked the creator for many things. Our protection, our beautiful land and water, our experiences, alone and as a family. 5 years I took notes, developed patterns, won derbies, had campfires at camp etc. We havent left yet. But RRFN we will miss you...  First big RR walleye  First smallie at what became my favorite bass spot. Right in the rapids. I caught thousands of fish in there  Big walleye pull hard here. No wet socks. Many friendships were made over fishing here  Campfires by the hundreds! Unreal times with friends and our children.  Lots of fish frys as well.  Always nature all over. The kids found everything and anything. Baby snapper  My daughter caught this during a derby. Almost lost it at the hole but managed to save the catch. The derby was cancelled due to freezing rain  They just learned to hold bass lol. Didnt take long to master it, as they all have pb's over 4lbs on the first year  Big walleyes around in the fall and spring  Contnd"
879199,manitoubass2,2014-11-02 21:16:00,11391,"They just get thick! The average size in fall is probably 25""!  ice fishing started out very basic. the river can be a killer come ice  the kiddos would fish, go sliding when bored!why not catch some air?  come spring id take full advantage... we now had patterns!  snagged my first ever lamprey, ewww lol. i actually called the MNR over this haha  the fish that landed my first derby win...  not too bad for a 4 year old lol  with good times also comes bad. sturgeons netted and left to rot. we successfully realeased a few. sad day  hooled d√®ep and had to keep. hows that for a 6 year olds smallie?  the view of many summertime evenings!  many beauty days on the ice!  we fished no matter the weather"
879200,manitoubass2,2014-11-02 21:34:00,11391,"so many of these were caught throughout the years it became normal  highwater brought crappies and much excitement  a few years later, handling fish was no problem!  the kids had grown. now catching fish on their own. choosing their own baits, tying on and getting out snags  the crappies grew and increased our excitement  the kids helped local tourneys. they were now experts at handling fish    big bass just became so normal we could joke about it  in the past two years flood waters became the norm. changing patterns and fishability  aside from fishing we all enjoy golf. my drive landed next to this momma bear  we always enjoyed visiting the sturgeon farm"
879202,manitoubass2,2014-11-02 21:49:00,11391,more fish on the ice  fat fat fish  small sturgeon. they get pretty big here   they bend the rod a little lol  whitefish!!!! my first ever  addicted to buckshot jigs    my kids love the boat lol  need a break from fishing? go golf!
