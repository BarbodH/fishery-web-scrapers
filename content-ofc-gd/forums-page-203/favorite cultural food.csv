I've never looked back. My mom still is nervous coming over for dinner as she thinks we'll cook some weird stuff.  Love sushi and probably have it once a week now (also working for a Japanese company it's a given you must eat sushi!) Have been on the Indian and Thai lately cooking a lot at home. Amazingly easy dishes to put together and the sauces are easily available at most grocery stores. Curries, Masala and my current favourite is Vindaloo. You have to like the heat for this one. Simple one pot cooking with your fav meat and stir fry veggies added  Best Butter Chicken out there guys is at Costco!!!!. Big ready to serve plate - just add rice. You find it in around their meat counter in the prepared foods. Still the best curry dishes out there come from English pubs!  Also eat alot of seafood and fish now from the grocery store, Halibut loins, shrimp, catfish,..... A common request from my son is to have a pigout meal of mussels - steamed in butter and white whine  There is a Peruvian place opened up by me on Oakville called Machu Pichu that is getting a lot of press about the different ceviches they have  Rotis, Gyros, shawarma are my grill cheese and hamburgers now"
