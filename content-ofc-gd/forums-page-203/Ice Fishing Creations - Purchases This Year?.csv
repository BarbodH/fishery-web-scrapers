883061,Rod Caster,2014-11-25 21:49:00,5784,"I was a off topic on my last post: I need new line for my ice rods, other than that I'm pretty good for this year.  It's not going to happen this year, but I'd like to build an ice shack and place it on the lake down my gravel road; sure would make it easy to fish for a couple hours without having to haul all kinds of gear every time I want to go out."
884371,Fisherman,2014-12-02 21:38:00,7201,"Great price Let us know if they work well. Well the mailman dropped off the new purchase yesterday.  It doesn't come with any instructions, however I'm sure most of us can figure out the star drag, clicker button and spool drag without to much difficulty. The spool has the tiniest amount of wobble, nothing I'm worried about.  To engage free spool, push in the side gold button, to retrieve, just crank, instant anti reverse.  I put a 110yd pony spool of 6lb mono on, lots of room left over.   One turn of the crank retrieves 16 inches of line.  I pulled line a couple of times with different drag settings, seems to come off smooth.  Then I put on the smallest snap swivel, free spool and down it goes.  Added the tiniest split shot and it takes right off.  This was done inside.  I took the spool off, there's no grease in there to get stiff and slow things down in freezing temps.  So far so good, wait and see how it performs with a perch on the other end."
884373,Terry,2014-12-02 21:50:00,14456,"sounds like it will do the job, and a real good price"
884379,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-02 22:17:00,10439,It's not really for ice fishing but I could use it if I wanted. I'm in the middle of designing and building a large komatik to haul my building materials in to my cabin site. The size will be just under 4' wide and 12' long.  My new planer and belt sander should come in handy.  I'll post pics when I get it built.
884382,Fisherman,2014-12-02 22:25:00,7201,Here's a couple more ideas I found: http://i1359.photobucket.com/albums/q781/Deryl-v/IMG_2022_zpscdf587a9.jpg and http://i625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331/431-sigs/PC030005.jpg

884502,jimmer,2014-12-03 16:12:00,2730,Never seen those Black Betty reels before. They look interesting and a possible purchase. Is there anywhere to buy them in Ontario? Quickme: You're going to love the Titans.

884556,Terry,2014-12-03 20:53:00,14456,I did the same with my black betty and could not get it to do it
884559,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:01:00,26272,Thank God Terry... or you'd want to return it to the point of purchase...
884561,bare foot wader,2014-12-03 21:05:00,1354,"hmm, i warrantied mine right out of the box, the new one does the same thing....they told me that's how it was...  I've used the reel and like the freespool function, but has a tendency to slip into freespool when it shouldn't, ie right before i set the hook...left hand retrieve, so when I hold rod with my right hand, the spool naturally faces the ground"
884563,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:07:00,26272,Is yours the regular Black Betty or the 6061 bare foot?
884564,bare foot wader,2014-12-03 21:08:00,1354,"6061  I was on the preorder list from reeds in the US...with shipping and duty, I really wish I waited for them to hit local stores first lol"

884567,bare foot wader,2014-12-03 21:15:00,1354,"older model, bought it the first month they came out, I warrantied immediately and same issue  guess I need to check out their website, did they change much on the new model?"
884568,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:19:00,26272,They enclosed it for 2015.. which I don't like and why I jumped through hoops to find some left hand '14's

881848,EC1,2014-11-20 06:19:00,930,"Just seeing who's getting the itch yet. I've got it pretty bad but the snow and Monday is turning me off just a bit.  So far I've done: Painted some glow in the dark paint to my panfish rods to become better at bite detection during low light conditions. Haven't made any big purchases yet this year after last year's splurging, but am looking at a hard rod case potentially. And lastly bought myself my very first tipup.  Let's hear from you guys"
881864,Acountdeleted,2014-11-20 13:01:00,2562,"I am CHOMPING at the bit to get out. If I had the money, I would do up a whole new Lake Trout combo with a heavy 32"" ugly stick, Pfluger president reel, 10 pound braid with an 8 pound fluro leader. Alas I don't have that kinda money so it'll probably just be the line I add to my old combo.  Debating selling my flip over for a pop up but that's small potatoes. Also debating modifying a live target bait ball to be a jigging lure under the ice. If it works I'll post pics.  Mostly just countin the days and waiting for Chad or Joey to mention that the ice is thick up there so I can start scouting."
881867,Moosebunk,2014-11-20 13:43:00,3970,Getting the Bravo seat re-uphosltered then plan to mount it back on me skidoooo.  Otherwise might need some minnows come March when ice fishing will likely begin this year.
