884256,chris.brock,2014-12-01 23:02:00,4053,"What's more important, the fishing or the accommodations in your opinion?"
884265,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-01 23:48:00,956,"Not too sure about accommodations, but if they want constant fish after fish action send them to Cooks Bay in Lake Simcoe.  They have hut rentals there for about $50 a person.  I can land 100 perch in one day, but too bad they are all around 4 or 5 inches long."

884333,SmokestackLightnin,2014-12-02 16:13:00,390,Brooks Cottages on Big Caribou Lake   I'll second Brooks.  S.  Unless something has changed this year this is not an option for ice fishing.  When the Ministry reorganized the zones a couple years back moving Caribou to zone 11 it closed off lake trout north of 522 till Feb 15 which really limited their ice fishing so they stopped.  I would contact them first to confirm.
