882721,SuperDave,2014-11-24 14:17:00,204,"Hey everyone, Planning on going to Belle River for what will probably be my last muskie outing of the season. Any feedback out there as to whats going on ? Ice/water temps/ fish/no fish/don't bother/go to Detroit river/marina frozen solid etc  Thanks,  Dave"
882728,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-24 14:43:00,956,Good luck.  I'm hopefully heading to Upper Niagara for one last battle.  Those muskies now are all probably nice and fat.
882746,Pigeontroller,2014-11-24 16:46:00,2793,Good luck.  I'm hopefully heading to Upper Niagara for one last battle.  Those muskies now are all probably nice and fat. These strong SW winds will likely have turned the Niagara to mud for awhile...
882763,aznphil,2014-11-24 17:19:00,73,i'm almost literally in the same boat...one last go windsor or niagara?  I hear there is ice at some of the launches in Windsor but hard to say after the weather this week
882796,Andy,2014-11-24 20:43:00,330,"Good luck. I'd like to know how you make out. I live at the top of the Thames river watershed and the ditches here are full with water laying everywhere. We've had so much rain. It will sooner or later end up dumping into Lake St. Clair at Lighthouse Cove, so that part of the lake may be the color of dark chocolate milk for days, not to mention all the trash being swept along. The Belle may be better as it is a much smaller river."
882810,outllaw,2014-11-24 21:42:00,1232,ramps should be open im heading to Windsor ramp in morning myself. its 3 klm from my keyboard. pm me.
882850,PBenson,2014-11-25 00:28:00,154,"Hopefully the water warms up, bite was non existent on Sunday. Not one fish caught all day."
882962,aznphil,2014-11-25 15:00:00,73,some pictures of the water  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154819730145363&set=a.112988370362.201950.736525362&type=1&theater
883032,Sebastian,2014-11-25 19:34:00,208,Any updates from today? I hope SW west winds push the mud out.
883086,Handlebarz,2014-11-25 22:46:00,3790,The Thames river was up 2-3' today flowing fast with lots of trees and all other garbage in Chatham
883654,SuperDave,2014-11-27 23:39:00,204,Well we went to Belle River and the tell tale sign of fish not biting was present. Not a single shore caster and only one other boat. We gave it for 5.5 hrs and called it quits. A few shore casters showed up in the afternoon but nothing caught.
883852,Rizzo,2014-11-29 00:30:00,4754,man that is rough. I did the same thing last year around this time. It involved breaking ice at the marina and avoiding ice flows out in the lake. Brutal brutal day. we drove 6 hours round trip and probably only fished 3! Caught zip and not even a rip. This year I saved myself the aggravation and put the boat to bed last week!
883884,captpierre,2014-11-29 01:46:00,2521,You Guys are die hards.
883901,PBenson,2014-11-29 03:03:00,154,"Heading out Sunday morning, hoping the warmer weather gets the bite going"
883903,outllaw,2014-11-29 03:18:00,1232,troll slow . guys are using 10 inch straights slow. hey did I say slow
883935,PBenson,2014-11-29 13:37:00,154,I don't usually troll I cast or jig. Either method can be slowed right down though.
883937,lew,2014-11-29 13:56:00,12766,I don't usually troll I cast or jig. Either method can be slowed right down though.  If your looking for LSC muskies I'd take outlaws advice.
884073,Sebastian,2014-11-30 14:31:00,208,It all works if done properly. How did you make out? Is the lake dirty at all?
884078,outllaw,2014-11-30 15:42:00,1232,"just got back in from Windsor city marina. ramps wide open no ice. waters off but fishable. guys fishing perch from docks only 2 guys casting muskies.. at 55 degree,s its spring t-day and then back to reality.. I didn't fish. were testing proto-types.."
