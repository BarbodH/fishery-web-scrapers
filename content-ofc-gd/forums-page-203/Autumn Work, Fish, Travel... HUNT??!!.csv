882687,msp,2014-11-24 02:21:00,1336,Excellent report Moosebunk. Good luck on you future travels.
882696,Rod Caster,2014-11-24 03:09:00,5784,Great mini-book with pics.   That goose hunting experience was something else!... jealous.
882699,Tomcat,2014-11-24 04:03:00,395,Thanks for sharing Drew. Just an awesome read and truly enjoyable. Congrats and continued success with your life changes.

Put in plenty extra driving distance for bigger Larry fish when plenty easier skis are swimming the Reeedow down the road.  Gotta keep pluggin' away though, if it's another reward like that you're after.   A second page full of many of the long time members here sending along kind words, appreciated guys.  Thanks as always."
883218,TDunn,2014-11-26 03:47:00,680,Great report man. Always an amazing write up with some big fish involved. Good luck with  everything  TDunn

884142,S.M.05,2014-12-01 01:02:00,145,"Nice to see the pics of the hunt to go along with the story. Looks like you had another great multi species fall.  As exhausted as I was, muskie was a blast. Awesome of you to give me first fish! Hopefully get some ice time in with you.  Had to dig this up for ya. http://snltranscripts.jt.org/89/89rdiner.phtml"

882227,Joeytier,2014-11-21 21:09:00,3990,"Congrats on your new career avenues!  Loved the goose hunting shots the most, but they're all good, of course!  Nice Chevy too.  The new chevy front ends look nice but the front valences are way too low for my liking compared to previous generations.  I installed a 2"" level kit on my '13 and it made a huge difference."
882230,NewHips,2014-11-21 21:28:00,111,Great report....Thanks for sharing
882254,Rustic-Fisher,2014-11-21 23:06:00,826,A great read !!!  Gotta convince the wife to be a Nurse practitioner up that way ...... I'd be living the dream lol.
882261,Basskicker,2014-11-21 23:30:00,421,Awesome pics and story as always and congrats and good luck on your new path in life.

882267,ketchenany,2014-11-21 23:39:00,3229,"A truly great report as always  Nursing is a noble profession, I have one in my family."

882301,Moosebunk,2014-11-22 03:03:00,3970,"MB you are a master and deserve to be Paid to fish.  I think so too MB. lol.  Thanks bud!  Nice Chevy too. The new chevy front ends look nice but the front valences are way too low for my liking compared to previous generations. I installed a 2"" level kit on my '13 and it made a huge difference.  I hear ya Joey.  Think the face of the truck is a beauty honestly, but clearance is lower there for sure.  Arse end though sits up two inches higher at the trailer hitch than my 99 did.  To level the boat trailer have to go with the 5"" drop on the Reese hitch instead of my old 3"".  Side by side it's a bigger truck in appearance, but only time will tell if it's got the heart.  A great read !!! Gotta convince the wife to be a Nurse practitioner up that way ...... I'd be living the dream lol.  Meeee toooo.  It is in ""my"" long term plans for ""us"" to work six month winters away up North and chill at home and our Nipigon trailer in the summers.  Living the dream! lol.  moosebunk good karma to you and your family. we get to live thru your experiences you report. .moosebunk the nurse..father outdoorsman,photographer/story teller. once again thanks. im like a 12 year old kid reading your travels...thanks again.  Appreciated bud.  Hope the muskies have been good to you this season.  A truly great report as always  Nursing is a noble profession, I have one in my family.  A dirty noble profession. Man, buddies used to tease me for picking it... but I get 'em back nowadays. lol.  I guess Chevy does run deep, and I'm sure you and your new friend will find plenty of new roads  Sat in the new truck Chris and it felt just like the old one in many ways. Again, I've hammered on the last one and it's still going.  Fixing it along the way was still cheaper than payments.  The new one will see much easier roads and days, and the old one will stick around as long as it can for those times I need something to handle a beating.  Awesome pics and story as always and congrats and good luck on your new path in life.  Thanks Jay!  Great report....Thanks for sharing  Thanks Hips!"
882303,GRINGO LOCO,2014-11-22 03:08:00,20,A great read and pictures on a cold November night!
882328,wormdunker,2014-11-22 08:06:00,1711,Wow!  Awesome report!  Thanx for sharing.  Your pix are fabulous.  I'm a walleye guy.  Those are some of the nicest eyes I've ever seen!  Very healthy looking.
882337,spincast,2014-11-22 12:23:00,3279,spectacular scenery there MB. As usual a great read - a notable narrative  change compared to prior monologues.  Very cool path you have chosen to walk for this stage of your personal history - I look forward to the stops along the way. Somehow I suspect one of the next ones may include ice and some greys? Speaking of which - great shot and nice pair of fatties in this shot.
882346,RickOnt,2014-11-22 13:20:00,669,"Amazing Bunk A fantastic narrative and pics.  All the best, to you and your family, in your new endeavors.  Just another  ""life"" experience.  Have fun Cheers Rick"
882350,John,2014-11-22 13:34:00,2956,Simply awesome Bunk! You live your life how most of us dream. The difference being you have the balls to turn dreams into reality getting off your arse and doing rather than wanting! Kudo's........J...
882415,woodenboater,2014-11-22 18:02:00,2277,"great write up and wonderful photos ! I could spend days at the mouth of the river just taking it all in, the marsh grass looks gorgeous that time of year. Looks like you've found the right work/ life balance and we all envy your determination to chart your own destiny as you choose."

Somehow I suspect one of the next ones may include ice and some greys?  Greys will likely be the only thing for this winter, but if ending up in Nunavut at all and someone has a 13-foot auger extension and takes some pity, maybe there will be some char?  Simply awesome Bunk! You live your life how most of us dream. The difference being you have the balls to turn dreams into reality getting off your arse and doing rather than wanting! Kudo's........J...  Appreciate reading these words John, I do. Thanks.  Work and fish to make for more working and fishing.  great write up and wonderful photos ! I could spend days at the mouth of the river just taking it all in, the marsh grass looks gorgeous that time of year. Looks like you've found the right work/ life balance and we all envy your determination too chart your own destiny as you choose.  We'll see how it goes with the work/travel gigs to some of the more north and remote communities of Nunavut.  It'll be a big challenge and something to balance for sure.  I'll see in the coming weeks if I can snap some of the same Attawapiskat Autumn pics but during the winter snow and freeze up,   Thanks doods."
882468,woodenboater,2014-11-22 22:10:00,2277,"Just came back from Wabush, Labrador...that would be an interesting place to work. Everyone raves about the fishing and hunting there and if you love slinging flies, coastal Labrador is a short haul away. Also heard the Trans Labrador highway is pretty well all blacktop now, your truck would love a road trip methinks"

I totally respect your first part of this one. Taking time to think of changing your life and how it will effect you and your family. From all reports about your family,you have much love and support, which makes it that so much easier.  All the best to you Andrew.  Great pictures and loved the hunting report.  Happy holidays to you and yours as well."

882565,Bernie,2014-11-23 14:03:00,3190,Thanks for the entertaining read Drew.Hope I get the chance to ride the rivers up there someday.Most likely be on the ice road this winter at least a few times.

Also heard the Trans Labrador highway is pretty well all blacktop now, your truck would love a road trip methinks  That'd be an awesome area to check out.  Still, probably take the old truck. lol. Would like to one day fish in Arctic Quebec... that'd probably be the first goal.  Most likely be on the ice road this winter at least a few times.  Pop in the hospital if you're through town Bernie and I'm around.  Some awesome coffee just across the street, I'll buy.  Taking time to think of changing your life and how it will effect you and your family. From all reports about your family,you have much love and support, which makes it that so much easier.  They make all possible.  With all the ways to stay connected, the relatively short stints away will be a little easier.  Family travel plans for 2015 already booked to make up for some lost time."
