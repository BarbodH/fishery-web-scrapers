883991,kickingfrog,2014-11-29 19:02:00,8333,Zero gravity flights coming to North Bay:  http://www.nugget.ca/2014/11/28/s3-to-offer-zero-gravity-flights-2   Not in my price range.... and I'd likely spend the whole trip puking into a bag... at least I'd hope it would get into the bag.
883996,misfish,2014-11-29 19:21:00,29133,"LOL  Ya,not in mine as well.  You remember that ride where the wheel goes round and round then starts to tilt,and goes faster and faster. If you puked,it got back to you in a hurry.LOL"
883997,Terry,2014-11-29 19:25:00,14456,"if anyone wants to start a send TERRY to zero gravity flight fund, I would go  but it's too much money for 25 seconds of zero gravity for me."
884001,irishfield,2014-11-29 19:46:00,26272,"My kids, and a few adults, have been getting those for free... for over 24 years! lol Fun watching your pen float to the back of the tailcone..."
884004,Canuck2fan,2014-11-29 19:57:00,1444,"Irishfield, that is a pretty expensive way to steal someone's pen LOL.  My friend had his private pilots license when we were in our late teens, and when I could afford to rent a plane for an hour we would go, fly to another airport have lunch...  He would always go here hold the map for me, then make it float in my lap. So I can't see paying someone to do it now.  I didn't like those kind of G's I like the other kind.... So of course being a friend he would do it all the more once he knew it bothered me. Like what was I going to do step out of the plane, or knock him out and land it myself? I don't think so LOL"
884010,Rod Caster,2014-11-29 21:59:00,5784,Cool. I may get to see these planes as they take-off and start landing. They seem to like my airspace.
884026,kickingfrog,2014-11-29 23:13:00,8333,I'd be interested in just watching the dives and climbs.
884331,Mike Pike,2014-12-02 15:59:00,1332,"Flights would cost from $2,800 to $7,000.  I don't think I'd do it if payed that to ME!"
884426,Nipfisher,2014-12-03 03:14:00,2449,"If you can afford the tickets you could come stay at my ""bed and breakfast"". Cute little spare bedroom and a bowl of Shreddies in the morning for only $500 per night."
