884212,ketchenany,2014-12-01 17:58:00,3229,I just used this place for my printer and the products are good.  http://www.inkjetsuperstore.ca/
884218,Beans,2014-12-01 19:00:00,3339,I just bought 4 different cartridges for my Epsom Stylus NX130...  Even with the $9.95 for shipping it would have been cheaper at Inkjet Superstore...  I ended up paying more for the four cartridges than I paid for the printer itself...  What a rip-off !!!
884219,ketchenany,2014-12-01 19:15:00,3229,Look for the bulk packs cheaper still!
884224,BillM,2014-12-01 19:28:00,17367,This is why I use laser
884232,Terry,2014-12-01 20:23:00,14456,thanks I will check my model and see what kind of savings I get
884233,SmokestackLightnin,2014-12-01 20:25:00,390,Thanks for sharing this.  I have a Canon i960 that I use and ordered 14 cartridges at just over $50 including shipping.  Staples sells these cartridges for around $15 each so I am way ahead.
