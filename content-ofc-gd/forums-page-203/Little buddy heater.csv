884303,Mr.Topwater!,2014-12-02 06:48:00,81,C Tire $69. Warm enough for 1 man thermal hut?
884304,pics,2014-12-02 09:21:00,1268,I had an old school Coleman heater that heats mine well and my hut isn't a thermal...
884314,Thrilla,2014-12-02 12:36:00,164,Yes it is enough for a one man I use it in my 2 man and it takes the edge off fine
884332,BucktownAngler,2014-12-02 16:13:00,582,warm enough for a 1 man yes. a PITA to get lit on the ice in the cold.  id go with another option if possible
884345,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-02 17:14:00,956,Been using a little buddy heater for a few years in my four man tent.  Works great no problems
884348,Burtess,2014-12-02 17:41:00,901,"Puts out about the same amount of BTU as the Little Buddy but way cheaper, I picked one up to try out in my flip this year as the regular Buddy takes up more floor space.http://www.sail.ca/en/catalogue/camping/heaters/28/m-3s-heater/Burt"
884350,bow slayer,2014-12-02 17:54:00,1074,"I have a coleman Black Cat ,I think it is around 3000 btu   works great for my 2 man fishtrap"
884356,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-02 18:49:00,10439,"Wouldn't do squat for me. Most of the time my 16,000 BTU sunflower heater can't keep my hut warm enough to stop my holes and lines from freezing up. I do want to pick up one of the regular buddy heaters for use in my camper in Alaska though. I have used my buddies and it works quite well and I don't have to listen to the furnace going."
884358,mike rousseau,2014-12-02 19:48:00,4661,I used to use one in my trap pro 1 man... NOT THE THERMAL!!!  You won't be toasty warm... But it will cut the cold and help keep your gear from icing up...  I use a regular buddy heater in he same hit now and some days I'm glad I have the extra BTUs  And if you open your hut at all the little buddy takes a while to get the hut warm again  If your the type to seal your hut with snow and not open it all day you'll be ok...
884360,BillM,2014-12-02 19:53:00,17367,Thermal hut makes a huge difference along with making sure it's sealed up with snow if possible.
884363,bare foot wader,2014-12-02 20:12:00,1354,"little buddy didn't do anything for me in -15 or lower...went back to store within a week  regular buddy is a good unit, and you can also run it with a 5 or 10 lb tank, works out cheaper in the long run compared to the 1lb green tanks"
884384,misfish,2014-12-02 22:40:00,29133,"Funny how we grow old and want more then less. Well I want more heat and less cold.  Mr. buddy for me this year.  And no,you cant come in. I would have to open the door and let the cold air in. Bugger off.       "
