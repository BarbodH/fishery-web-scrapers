I have to agree with you, now I hear guys fishing with lead core and dipsys for Walleye, can you imagine  . I'd have a better thrill cranking my boat on the trailer. Can't think of eating any Walleye from there. There just picture fish, and some are not."

884336,c10,2014-12-02 16:40:00,131,"I went the week after thanksgiving because I had a break in October from school this year.  We caught one walleye over ten pounds and two around 20 inch's then the biggest drum i have ever caught, thing was almost 15 pounds and pulled the planer back like Kings do lol.  I know they may be junk fish, but i will tell you the big ones are sure fun to catch ahahaha"
884339,Acountdeleted,2014-12-02 16:49:00,2562,"My buddy has a cottage on Quinte and the only thing we target are sheepshead. All we do is throw out a nice big minnow on a rod and have a few beers, wait for the fight and hang on for dear life. Its always a blast. Forget targeting the bass or walleye."
884346,Mike Pike,2014-12-02 17:15:00,1332,"Years ago when I just got into fishing, I remember a trip to Hay Bay with friends to target walleye.  I hooked into what I thought was surely going to be the biggest walleye of our trip!  When I brought it to the boat, I asked my friends; ""What the heck is it?""  They seemed very unimpressed and said it was a Sheepshead and to throw it back.  Way back then, I had never heard of them.  Never saw one on a sportfish poster or read about 'em in the fishing magazines.  Yet, here was this big, bruiser of a fish that reminded me of the saltwater fish I would catch in Florida, and it fought better than any fish I had evey caught in those early days,  To this day, I can't understand the exact reasons for the disrespect the poor ol' Sheepshead gets but I for one love 'em on the end of my line and and admire they way they look and fight."
884393,SuperDave,2014-12-02 23:41:00,204,we caught quite a few on Erie this year while bass fishing. The respect is lost when you think it's an 8lb smallie and turns out to be a big ugly sheep. They definitely hit crankbaits hard though and put up a great fight.
884394,Steve,2014-12-02 23:50:00,2075,"its too bad folks are fishing deeper and deeper on quinte....  those fish sure are going to suffer....  folks using dipsy's without batting an eye.  others using divers off leadcore.....one person I read thought his leadcore was going 2' a colour....dropping a td11 off 5 colours of core and thought he was going 30' down....  a certain board owner suggesting that if you bring in your fish from the depths quick, and release it ""right away"", it'll magically fix itself and swim back down...how many folks reading that, not knowing any better, thinking he's correct?  whats worse is many of the guides, in order to get fish for their clients, are fishing deeper and deeper as well....  oh well....like most fisheries, as the quality of fishing suffers, the crowds will diminish...then the fishery will rebound, and go through the cycle again."
884557,msp,2014-12-03 20:57:00,1336,"Well said Steve. I was out there last weekend and at the end of the day I stopped by the Picton harbor Inn for a bit of "" dock talk "" with the guys. A full picnic table and 2 full coolers of giant walleye about to undergo filleting. When I asked a couple of guys how the bite was, the response was "" as long as you got your bait down below 40 ft. , you got bit "" Kind of sad to see so many big dead walleye. And that was a small tournament too. You would think these guys would be a bit more responsible. But I guess they have the right to keep their limit"
884566,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:12:00,26272,"Yes they have their right to a limit and if that's all they got ... no harm no fowl !  That said, I know at least one Charter captain that is never running below 30 feet and has no issue keeping his clients happy!"

884647,Terry,2014-12-04 01:42:00,14456,"but it's one over 24"" isn't it a cooler full of giants may imply  poaching"
884690,Moosebunk,2014-12-04 07:22:00,3970,"Not sure about the ""edible"" comments?  Consumption for numbers and size is greater off the Great Lakes than it is many, many remote and pristine Ontario back lakes.  Remembering that, it's mercury which is tested in walleye, as ""little"" levels of other pollutants are actually found in their meat and, they live rather short lives in the GL's.  This is only what I recall though, from a telephone conversation with someone with ""The Guide To Eating Ontario Sportfish.""  Think overall the boat only had few with blown-out air bladders this year, most bigger eyes actually hitting higher up on the shallowest lines. Wonderbread and Barbie were the best by far.  Those kept and consumed along with a few other keepers, tasted just fine."
