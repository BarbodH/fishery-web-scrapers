884663,John Bacon,2014-12-04 02:37:00,3277,"Licence is federal, tax is provincial.  Wouldn't the tax be federal now that we have HST?  I know the province gets 8/13 of the tax; but I believe it is all federally administered.  They gave all the PST employees severance packages even though they got jobs with the federal government."
884693,Weeds,2014-12-04 10:44:00,782,"I went so far as to get my m2 20  years ago. Every time I renew my drivers licence it renews as me having gm2, which is odd because I'm pretty sure that m2 expires after 5 years unless you do an exit test."

883557,Terry,2014-11-27 15:52:00,14456,So what has changed
883566,Fisherman,2014-11-27 16:56:00,7201,It has to be renewed every 10 years.
883581,John Bacon,2014-11-27 19:07:00,3277,Just tell your wife that your boat needs to be replaced after 10 years
883591,davey buoy,2014-11-27 19:53:00,5505,"Never understood that,as a side note a friend told me a few days back,that when he renewed his divers license,he noticed it was only a G now,not GM.He asked why his motor cycle license was not on it.They said after 20 years if it's inactive and you do not request to keep it  before renewal they get rid of it.What do I do now he asked.She said rewrite it again,(START FROM SCRATCH}. Very upset he was with no notification, and I would agree.I'm coming up to that point.I will be dropping in soon. Anyone believe that is right?,I'm thinking not."
883595,BFSC Kevin,2014-11-27 20:22:00,1351,New boat every ten years sounds good to me.
883601,Terry,2014-11-27 21:08:00,14456,"Never understood that,as a side note a friend told me a few days back,that when he renewed his divers license,he noticed it was only a G now,not GM.He asked why his motor cycle license was not on it.They said after 20 years if it's inactive and you do not request to keep it  before renewal they get rid of it.What do I do now he asked.She said rewrite it again,(START FROM SCRATCH}. Very upset he was with no notification, and I would agree.I'm coming up to that point.I will be dropping in soon. Anyone believe that is right?,I'm thinking not. how would they know it's inactive I have not owned a motorcycle in over 20 years, but I drive one every year, they would have know way of knowing just checked still DM but I had better check that on my next renewal"
883602,chris.brock,2014-11-27 21:12:00,4053,I guess they would assume you`re inactive because you haven`t bought a sticker for a bike plate for 20 years  redoing the course etc would suck
883604,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-27 21:15:00,956,Redoing it would suck.  I see that it's longer then when I first took it.
883605,Terry,2014-11-27 21:16:00,14456,"AGAIN,  you do not need to buy stickers to ride a motorcycle  cop could really be in trouble"
883636,John Bacon,2014-11-27 23:10:00,3277,I guess they would assume you`re inactive because you haven`t bought a sticker for a bike plate for 20 years  redoing the course etc would suck  You don't need to own a vehicle to drive one.  Lots of people have drivers licences without owning a car.
883650,Fisherman,2014-11-27 23:26:00,7201,"AGAIN,  you do not need to buy stickers to ride a motorcycle  cop could really be in trouble You mean the validation tag for the licence plate?"
883653,Terry,2014-11-27 23:38:00,14456,"what I meant was I drove someone else's bike, they have it licensed and insured  I don't need to own any vehicle to drive it I know a motorcycle cop that has never owned his own bike, he only drove the bike his work provided they would have no way of know he drives a bike every day, so if what was said true he and I would no  longer have the M on our license but we do as G license I know people who have never owned a car but have had their license for 50 years and drive all the time  sorry I just don't see it happening"
883657,chris.brock,2014-11-27 23:40:00,4053," You don't need to own a vehicle to drive one.  Lots of people have drivers licences without owning a car.  nobody is disputing that, it`s their assumption not mine  it`s not knowing about this rule until it`s too late and your M is gone that sucks"
883681,Fisherman,2014-11-28 01:02:00,7201,Any chance you have a copy of an old licence.  I'd be some cranky too.
883734,Fish Farmer,2014-11-28 12:50:00,2234,Just tell your wife that your boat needs to be replaced after 10 years I like that idea  Mines 11 years old. I wonder if you need to change the #'s on your boat or just update? Wonder how many new?
883771,DanD,2014-11-28 15:21:00,2223,"It's another way of getting a bite out of our wallets. A few years back they changed the designation of my mechanic's license from ""A"" which covered automotive and truck and I had my red seal making my licence inter-provincial. When they split the automotive and truck into S for automotive service tech and T for truck & coach; they grandfathered my truck license but pulled the inter-provincial seal? I tried fighting it; but they said if I wanted my inter-provincial truck back I would have to rewrite the exam; which comes with a price tag (can't remember how much); which wasn't cheap let alone the refresher coarse's I would need to take. Because I don't work in a ""truck"" shop doesn't mean I don't work on trucks; but now (not that I'd have a mind to at my age) I can't legally work on trucks out of Ontario; total Bull! I worked had to get my ""A"" licence and Ministry pulled part of it way from me?????  Dan."
883779,Fisherman,2014-11-28 17:11:00,7201,"I like that idea  Mines 11 years old. I wonder if you need to change the #'s on your boat or just update? Wonder how many new? No new numbers, no cost, probably just to keep your personal info up to date."
884538,Fish Farmer,2014-12-03 19:46:00,2234,I got a reply back from them and this is the form to fill out and instructions. Sent mine out this morning Click below http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/wwwdocs/Forms/84-0172E_1308-08_E.pdf
884560,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:04:00,26272,"Thanks Dave! Essentially they are concerned about SAR and having valid information on file. Makes some sense, but not a lot for many that have their boat registered to a home address and it stays at a cottage dock.  Also note the vague statement on the 10 years validity..."
884562,irishfield,2014-12-03 21:05:00,26272,IF there are CHANGES you must update your licence. Pretty pointless to just get a new piece of paper that has the exact same thing on it every 10 years... but it is the government...
884571,hirk,2014-12-03 21:44:00,571,"Lost my m same way, renewed and the m wasnt there, i didnt have a bike then an figured it was a typo but because i didnt bring it to thier attention within 2 yrs i lost my m."
884572,SylvanOwner,2014-12-03 21:56:00,266,"Very interesting, going through my M now.  Also, regarding the pleasure craft licence.  Would a renewal trigger a paper trail for any unpaid sales tax?  Just keeping an eye out for my fellow OFC'er of course."
884581,Fisherman,2014-12-03 22:36:00,7201,"Licence is federal, tax is provincial."
884584,irishfield,2014-12-03 22:41:00,26272,"Doesn't matter.. Transport Canada is indeed Federal, yet they are mandated to send the Province a list of ownership transfers of all aircraft on a monthly basis, so boats would be no different."
