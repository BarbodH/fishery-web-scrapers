884151,walleye ia,2014-12-01 03:07:00,5,"I should be clear I certainly don’t live up north, but sure wish I did.  I live in Iowa and enjoy camping and fishing the “bush country” as often as I can.  I like to be off the beaten path the adventure is half the fun for me.  Lately, I’ve been going quite a ways north of Pickle Lake beautiful and peaceful area.  My next area of Ontario I would like see is the whole Lake Nipigon region. Oh, by the way, tiller…of course lol. Thanks"
