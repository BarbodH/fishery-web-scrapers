Awesome report Dave, some beautiful country up your way and great fishing too!  Thanks for the report.  Maybe your work IT guys are blocking them? They are linked from my Facebook account. Glad to hear you got them @ home.   Thanks again all for the comments."
879922,jbailey,2014-11-08 18:51:00,866,great photos! the bend in the rod in that one picture is insane! love the pic standing in the river with the pooch. Thanks for sharing. Cheers
879948,Moosebunk,2014-11-08 22:43:00,3970,Alaska!!!  How can I not tell ya that I enjoyed this one Dave...
879949,pics,2014-11-08 22:47:00,1268,A grizzled bunch for sure.. but then again some of the nicest people I know look just like your crew... amazing pictures...
879971,MJIG,2014-11-09 01:39:00,227," That fish is a male Dolly Varden (cousin to the Arctic Char) in spawning colours.  Feature-wise, they look like they carry a lot of similar traits to specs. Did you eat any?"
879972,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-09 01:41:00,10439,"They are in the same family as char, brook trout, lake trout and bull trout. This is why they look similar. No eating of them. There is a limit of 1 under 16"" and they taste horrible @ that time of the year when feeding on eggs."
879973,MJIG,2014-11-09 01:50:00,227,"they taste horrible @ that time of the year when feeding on eggs.  Ah, so their beauty is skin-deep.  Pound-for-pound, specs give a pretty good fight - same with the Dolly's?"
879974,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-09 02:02:00,10439,"Yep, they pull like mad for their size."
879977,jace,2014-11-09 02:18:00,472,"Those are some nice fish, Dave.    Good fat 2nd run kenai silvers who got fat  waiting for the tourists to leave.  heh.     Kenai was so high and fast while i was there that it became dangerous.   A lot of people left to fish other spots.   What's funny is the number of people who went all the way to Valdez which had a run failure this season while other closer places like seward had record returns, so they ended up  turning around.   not very funny when it's 2-3mpg through the mountains at $4-5/gallon.    on second thought, that is funny.  LOL.  I like how that one fish looks happy to be photographed while he rest appear to be in shock or indifferent to being caught..  I ran into 4 other deadliest catch boats this year.  I'll put up photos and we'll assemble the fleet except for the Wizard which i've never seen in any year.  What did your friends think of the new 29"" and 1 trip halibut reg?   I heard about that from all sides and nobody likes it.  The new rule makes it nearly impossible to justify a charter business.  Do you know anybody from the Chitina area ?   LOL.   re: alaska bush family show."
879982,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-09 02:36:00,10439,"Don't know any one in Chitina, j ace. Never watched that show but most of them were charged with fraud a couple of weeks ago for falsely claiming PFD $$$$ in AK.  It's good when the water's high and people leave. The fish are still there and very catchable, they just move to different spots. When I was there in 2012 the river was so high that they closed the entire river to boat traffic for a week. I still caught tons of fish walking in and was one of only 3 boats on the upper river the day it reopened.  Can't say about what my friends think about the charter regs as most of my buddies have their own boats and those regs don't apply to private boats. Still a 2 fish any size limit for the private guys.  The crab boats are hiding in port right now as there is a wicked storm hitting the area this weekend. Forecast was for 100mph gusts and waves 50+ feet."
880010,solopaddler,2014-11-09 12:44:00,8605,Good stuff Dave! Wish the silvers had been in that thick when I was there! Your buddy Ed looks like a grizzly bear with a fly rod.
880012,Terry,2014-11-09 12:58:00,14456,great trip and report  another spot for my bucket list
880068,Musky or Specks,2014-11-09 22:50:00,2710,Man that is a dream trip. Whenever I get jealous of your life I just try to remember how much I hate winter.
880107,BillM,2014-11-10 01:50:00,17367,"Right on Dave!  I dunno what I'd do more, take pics or fish"
880207,hoops12,2014-11-10 19:41:00,127,awsome!!
881200,scuro2,2014-11-17 01:54:00,904,Amazing.....thanks for the pics...thoroughly enjoyed them.
882245,jace,2014-11-21 22:14:00,472,"the alaska bush family show was a reality show about a sitka family that moved into the chitina.   ...all fake, scripted, and staged.  The remote cabin on just off the highway but they never showed it from that angle.  There's a new show called Edge of Alaska (or close?) that takes place the tiny town of McCarthey.  I know 2 of the 50 people who live off the grid there.  LOL.   I'm sure it'll be a similar scenario.  Most of the people i know have their own boats too but a few of the have boats big/fast enough to charter people into the open gulf and business is way down because it makes no sense to pay over $300 to get on a boat and take home a 29"" fish under 10lbs plus another.  anyways, like mine, your countdown has probably already started for next year and already thought about what you'll do differently until you get it right.  ;D"
884131,S.M.05,2014-12-01 00:00:00,145,WOW! .....Trout and salmon haven for sure. Your living the good life up there.
884137,captpierre,2014-12-01 00:50:00,2521,Awesome.  So those bows.  Are they local river fish or do they live in the ocean?
884144,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-01 01:40:00,10439,Awesome.  So those bows.  Are they local river fish or do they live in the ocean?  They are native river fish Pierre. There are a few ocean run steelhead that roam up the river though.
884153,captpierre,2014-12-01 03:11:00,2521,thanks  Drifter.  pretty dark up there these days?
884155,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-01 03:20:00,10439,yup.
879772,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-07 04:31:00,10439,"Well I finally got time to put a little report together of my fall excursion to Alaska. This year’s trip was excellent and probably one of if not the best one so far.  The weather was excellent, the company and the fishing were even better!!! It was a pink year so there were millions of pink salmon in the river (mostly in the middle section) so I spent a lot of time down river hunting the giant bows that feed on the roe that litters the river during the spawn. I did spend about 1/3 of my trip fishing the upper river at the beginning of the trip while waiting for the middle river to turn on and caught plenty of fat bows and dolly varden. I had a weekend trip fishing for feeder kings and halibut out of Homer while I was there also. Enough jabbering, on with the pics!!!!  A little grizz chasing some anglers off their spot.      My buddy Joe from North Carolina came up for a week.    I taught him how to cast his centerpin and he managed a bunch of fish on it.    I even caught a fish or two.      I did a ton of fishing with my buddy Ed from Palmer AK, both on the upper and middle river. Here’s a nice upper river bow.    He brought his pooch along when we fished the upper river. It was a bit of a gong show with both our mutts in the same drift boat at times.    Heading out of Homer to chase some salty fish with my buddy Keith his girl and a couple of friends for the weekend. As usual in the off season FV/Time Bandit is docked in the harbor down in Homer.      Heading out to the fishing grounds.      First order of the day was to try and hook up on some sammins!!!      After catching a couple it was time to try for some tasty halibut. We did well on them on Saturday with a 60# fish as the biggest of the trip.    We also caught a couple of large skate.    At dusk we headed for the village of Seldovia where we had a cabin rented for the night.      Seldovia is at the end of the rainbow!!    The next day dawned clear and sunny. I knew it would be a nice day but the fishing would not be stellar.      We saw plenty of sea otters including this fella in the harbor at Seldovia.    I was right about the fishing as I caught the only halibut this day. The spots that produced the day before only held Irish Lords on day two. Tons of them. We must have caught 100 of the things.    Continued............."
879774,motv8tr,2014-11-07 04:40:00,2587,"Wow, some really great shots there, what an amazing trip!  Maureen"
879775,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-07 04:42:00,10439,"Back to the river fishin’, Middle river this time. I got out with a good friend and guide Billy from Cooper Landing AK. We spent the day along with his brother Carl and Billy’s buddy from California chasing big bows.             Some more middle river fishing, this time with Ed and his buddies Eban and George. During the time I fished solely in the middle I didn’t have a day off in three weeks. It was a bit like work without the dread and boredom. The weather was good for the most part with only a day or two of rain. A little rain and clouds can make for some pretty nice pictures though.        The silvers were in thick this year which is always a bonus. I got this fresh chrome on my new 11 ½’ 6-10# XST and it about maxed it out.    Ed got a big chromer too!!!    And the big one of the trip.      Time for a few pictures of big bows now.              We got a bunch of dolly’s as well.            By the last week of my trip the bite in the middle river had died somewhat so I headed back to the upper river and fished with my buddy Jack. We decided we would walk into some spots rather than use his drift boat as the fish were now holed up in a few spots that were easy to get to.       We got some snow late in the week just before I had to head home but the bruins were still out.    The trout were still about too.      A couple more parting pics.      Time to head home for another year.  "

Tuff looking bunch I tell ya.  The last fish on your first post wouldn't also be known as Monk Fish would it? Just had some poor mans lobster Sunday, 12 bucks a pound in Hamilton. It doesn't taste like any Lobster I ever had. Looks the same but it ends there. The fish is head and all tail."
