I guess you guys have never been in my rural neighborhood, the best one I like is the full size Stork with it's mouth open. Some would be considered folk art and would go for a few hun in a gallery in T.O."

Would have taken them a good 20 minutes to unbolt the thing from the steel railings. I'd get another, except that they will soon be cancelling local mail delivery"
