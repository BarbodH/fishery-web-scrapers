278194,danbo,2008-12-11 11:17:00,2646,Thanx bro..just remember to leave the pins in!!  BTW..a Christmas Card would be nice..
278197,SlowPoke,2008-12-11 11:25:00,2984,"He's just going to trade them... save the postage, ask Danbo what he wants and post 'em in the classifieds!   Back to the show.... Completely different! Not just the FoF format but Gar? I remember a long while back seeing a fishing show about peacock bass. It rocked. And then everybody did a show on peacock bass! Dave is the 'gator gar trailblazer! -Brian"
278203,danbo,2008-12-11 11:51:00,2646,I sure likes to trade..
278306,tdotfisherman,2008-12-11 17:20:00,317,"Review of Dave Mercer's Facts of Fishing: The Show; Season 2, Episode 1:  The introduction was funny as always, I liked the way you spliced in some new clips, but I found the old music a little bit more effective, but not that big of an issue. I still like the format, one day on the water. I liked how the show started off with a bang, in Texas for huge Aligator Gar. The enthusiasm was great, you could truely feel the fact that Dave was having the time of his life out there catching monster Gar. Funny and interesting as always. All in all, a very good first episode of the second season, which I know a lot of us have been waiting for. I like the new 'comic book' style of recapping you do in this season, it's visually unique and engaging I would say. I like the fact that you still keep with the ending, where you do the ""facts"" recap, this concept works well. All in all, I felt it was a good episode, it kept me interested the whole way through, and I look forward to more shows, wether they are shot in Canada, or abroad.  Thanks,  -TDotFisherman"
278340,Dave Mercer,2008-12-11 19:00:00,148,"Hey Guys, Thanks for all the great feedback and thanks for watching. As T.J said we will draw a winner for the lures on Sunday after everyone has had a chance to watch The Show on The Score. So please check out the show and give me your feedback for your chance to win.  P.S Thanks to all of you that sent me emails. You will never know how much your kind words mean!  Dave"
278342,Nemo,2008-12-11 19:03:00,727,Cool saw the FOF truck heading north on Yonge Street at Wellesley around 8:30 a.m. this morning. Nice rig.  You may want to brush the snow off the rear license plate so the Cops don't stop you.....
279039,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-13 16:01:00,3761,"WOW that was a great show. The aligator gar were huge, and looked like a tough fight. I wonder what the differences are from a aligator gar to a gar pike... Nice show Dave!!!"
279418,tibbs,2008-12-14 15:13:00,650,Just watched it this morning.  Great start to the new season.  Looked liked the alligator gar were a blast to catch!  If you liked still fishing then you should go out to the Fraser river to catch some of these:  
279428,Handlebarz,2008-12-14 15:19:00,3790,Dave your show was great as always as a musky nut I again am thinking of them big gators what a blast to see that show you sure do know how to have fun on the water you would fit in with the crowd down here on LSC chasing musky.
279529,Cudz,2008-12-14 18:21:00,2652,"Very good show. Very cool fish. I really enjoy your report card format of the show. My favourite is the beginning of the show when you are making that first cast aftern ensuring that everything is just perfect.  Bam!  Birdsnest!. lol.  I can so relate to that. Just one question about the show and the editing.  When you are about to set hook on that big gar (the one that you lose), You show the line being run off of a calcutta.  When you are fighting the fish you have a more saltwater style reel.  What gives?  (I may have to re-watch that because it is possible that I am wrong) Keep up the good work. Can't wait until the next episode. Also congrats at all the face time in the BPS northern catalogue.  Good to see you and Deforge in there as much you are.  Cool to see Pete in there a bunch as well."
279566,brifishrgy,2008-12-14 19:53:00,559,Great show ...Its always nice to see someone fishing for something different
279586,Handlebarz,2008-12-14 20:44:00,3790,Yeah Thanks a lot Dave this show has me so hooked today I was just watching it again for the fourth time (I did not get to watch the whole thing each time) when I missed what sounds like a great Bills drive (I am not a bills fan but like to watch Farve) But it was worth it as That first one you boat is a beast. I just wish you were able to boat that monster that broke off at the boat.
279592,nancur373,2008-12-14 21:03:00,1211,"I got one comment to make. This was the first time my wife has seen FOF. Her exact words were ""Dude can laugh""."

I swear the fishing god's are not happy with me no matter how often I say the Rapala prayer they just don't listen...  “Oh Lord…There he is…It feels like a big one…Please don’t let me lose him…I’ve never caught one this big before. I’ll try not to horse him, and if I land him, I promise to release him…and make a graphite replica if my wife says it’s ok. Thank you for the Rapalas…Amen.”"

278103,Hubbard,2008-12-11 01:30:00,22,Alligator Gar is what he is fishing for. I love Dave's show by far one of the best in the business.
278106,irishfield,2008-12-11 01:37:00,26272,Beat by a newbi on his first post Danbo.....that's gotta hurt ! lol

278114,GBW,2008-12-11 01:49:00,8460,"LOL! Ah, well the kids are now in bed BUT I missed the last 1/3 of the show! from what I did see I liked and that is one huge fish!  Nice going Dave.  I did like that this show was not in an exotic location either and is something that most people can afford to do. let the bait run with the line a bit... I wish I could do that but I feel a hit and set the hook sometimes missing the fish...  No wonder I didn't have a great year... Geoff"
278115,Rich,2008-12-11 01:50:00,3927,I knew it.. awesome show.
278116,Drew_10,2008-12-11 01:51:00,111,Alligator Gar in TEXAS!!!!

278121,moemoe,2008-12-11 02:11:00,352,"Awesome show, loved it! it was nice to see a unique species that hasn't been profiled before, Great fishing show too with not a lot of fluff,  I would have been interested with the fill in on info of what the dead bait was though"
278122,danbo,2008-12-11 02:11:00,2646,"Here's big Dan's review:  Well, with all the hype that Howie Longshot was crowing about.. I just had to tune in to the Season 2 Premier of Dave Mercer's ""The Facts of Fishing Show"" on WFN  TV. Son of a..gun, what a blast it was!  The Big Guy was off to the Lone Star state of Texas, USA. His mission: to catch the ""Dinosaur of the South"".. the Alligator Gar.  With his Guide ""Mark"" & trusty cameraman along for the ride, they loaded up the big barge for a run up the river. It was mid-morn & fish could be seen surfacing & chasing Mullet. With heavy-duty Shimano Baitcasting tackle they rigged-up. A stout 4x 3/0 Treble hook plus a strong wire leader was readied. Then a big chunk of bait was impaled, as they slowly scouted along for signs of their prehistoric quarry. Sight-fishing is the name of the game. As the menagerie of southern wildlife was admired, the boys had a few laughs with some Thumb-wrasslin'. Nothing like a wild 'gator or loon or Turkey Vulture to add to the relaxing boat rides ""atmosphere"". Soon the fish appeared & the baits were cast out. The anticipation of a hook-up was building fast! Suddenly..the water erupted as our Host hammered the hooks home! Six feet of tail-walkin', water-thrashin Gar careened across the screen! YeeHaw & Fish on! Like a monster Musky on Steroids..the mighty fish fought with all it's might!! I truly envied the fun those dudes were having. Finally wrestled into his arms, Dave hoisted a 100 pound creature that had him smiling so wide I thought his ears had fallen off! Lol. Them boys had as much fun as you could ever want, with all the fish they caught & lost.. Ya Baby! That's a Darn fine way to start the season brother! Now that's a wrap!  Cheers, Danbo"
278150,TJQ,2008-12-11 03:43:00,7806,Looks like Hubbard's GOT IT...  PM me you mailing address and Ill get the touque out to ya. Keep the comments coming and Dave will pick a winner on Sunday after the show has been on the Score!
278183,danbo,2008-12-11 10:39:00,2646,"Huh?  Where's Kirk..I need a ruling.. Technically speaking, Roy said ""GO"" & I did.    Dang..must be my Karma.."
