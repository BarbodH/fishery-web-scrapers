280735,2 tone z71,2008-12-17 05:11:00,1311,hmmm are you talking about Dave wheres your camp at
280739,kemper,2008-12-17 05:43:00,2232,"There is a rock shelf on buckhorn lake coming off of scotsman point that eats many boats every year. I spend a week there every year and in the past 10 years that  I can clearly remember, at least one boat has ended up toast because of them.  The best part? The channel is clearly marked with a red bouy about 300m off the point, and the rocks are bouyed as well.  Two years ago I watched someone roll in with their big truck and brand new triton. The guy blasted off at top speed completely ignoring the fact that you have to go AROUND the bouy to leave the bay and ripped his outboard off on the rocks. Idiot.   You are lucky to be telling us this story, definately a lesson for all involved. Boats and darkness can result in crap like this lol.  I have also heard of boats smashing into new peirs etc that arent loaded into the GPS units yet?"
280740,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-17 05:50:00,835,"Boating courses start in Jan.  maybe you can get a deal if you all go together, it'll be fun.  Buddy did something similar, he was trying to figure out what those goofy lights were when he hit the wake off a barge and got launched through the air at wot. The ladies still think he did it on purpose."
280764,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 12:29:00,8163,Absolute idiocy!!!
280780,Terry,2008-12-17 13:50:00,14456,so much for the Darwin Theory
280784,Roy,2008-12-17 13:58:00,13728,I don't know what you guys are complaining about. The dude obviously had his boater's competency card.
280786,TJQ,2008-12-17 14:07:00,7806,Wow... hey..  lesson learned Id say..  I'd comment on how ya shouldn't have done that blah blah blah...  but considering I live in a glass house...
280792,troutologist,2008-12-17 14:27:00,951,"Unfortunately its a part of growing up. Taking risks and learning from mistakes.  Glad no one was hurt. But its a heck of a story. I guess I appreciated it because it sounds exactly like me and a few buddies, expect minus about 250hp."
280805,BillM,2008-12-17 15:21:00,17367,"Our GPS works great!!!!   Now if I would have only paid attention to it when out in Severn Sound this summer.  ""Whoops, did I just miss that clearly visible green marker on the GPS?""  Bye bye skeg!!!  Ripped the damn thing clean off"
280839,Rizzo,2008-12-17 17:26:00,4754,"guess I'm paranoid but I'm rarely on the water after dark, and if I am, its barely faster than trolling speed so I can hear what's going on around me. Its not rocks I'm afraid of, its people who show little concern for their own or others safety...maybe you guys just proved I'm not so paranoid after all! At that speed no way could you avoid the drunk guy or teenage lovebirds who have gone out for a late night paddle. As a funeral director who has looked after many dead cottagers, I hope people learn from this post"
280844,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-17 17:54:00,10439,"I'm lucky!!!! During our open water season it doesn't get dark!!!! June, July and August there are no lights needed!! Well atleast not until the very end."
280851,LeXXington,2008-12-17 18:00:00,1928,outch.. 45 at night tisk tisk..  Glad no one was killed.  sure everyone in that boat will be more carefull
280858,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 18:28:00,8163," Yeah, and with a million candle power spotlight in my hand so I can see what I'm going to NOT run into!!!"
280865,mikeh,2008-12-17 19:01:00,824,"going that fast at night is asking for trouble, luckily nobody was seriously hurt.  We witnessed a guy in a Ranger bass boat with a Verado on the back hit Long Shoal on Simcoe (going about 30 mph), he was between the markers closer to the west one when he hit two different rocks. He was able to drive back to where he launched very slowly, during daylight hours."
280868,Cudz,2008-12-17 19:26:00,2652,He does.  He passed it the first time. We have all learned from that mistake and even in the daytime i find myself paying much more attention.  Tough lesson to learn but luckily nobody was injured and a lesson was learned.  I have been out since at night and we always take it really easy now.
280880,snag,2008-12-17 20:21:00,1932,I thought nobody drove a boat as bad as this guy:   Very Lucky man!
280898,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-17 21:05:00,0,"GPS at night? I'm pretty sure it says right on my GPS ..."" Do Not rely on Chart for Navigation Purposes. Not to mention that small amounts of light inside or outside for that matter, makes it very hard to see at night."
280931,sandybay,2008-12-17 22:40:00,64,I hit the tip of a pennisula one night at midnight and I was using gps it was out by a couple hundred yards. Cost me a new lower unit.
280937,Bass_boy7,2008-12-17 22:54:00,10,"Im glad to see your ok but my guess is there may have been a bit of boozing that night although you may not want to say it, everyone has done it, and shouldn't, but it happens on boats all the time, definately a lesson learned for sure."
280964,forrest,2008-12-18 00:06:00,1032,"Thanks for posting.  If I get someone calling me grandpa while driving the boat I have something different to tell them.  forrest PS On another bright side: at least the end of the boat sharing was amicable and you have a story to tell.  In your case, since, you hit it twice you can tel lhte story 2 times a night"
280980,Cast-Away,2008-12-18 00:37:00,790, Funny one SNAG! I call my fishing buddy Relic! Him and I sometimes stand up and hold onto the windshield when we are tooling along.
281015,nofish4me,2008-12-18 01:56:00,404,"  Yep, it was Dave. Our group, was staying at a camp in Key Harbour."
281135,maybe,2008-12-18 15:32:00,307,"Our little handheld Garmin is meant for hiking, and is loaded with street maps (shopping in Toronto) instead of topo or charts.  With a little sideways thinking, it works very well for getting home after dark.  During daylight, I took the GPS out and let it record our paths through the channels and around the lakes.  I know that if I'm within X feet either side of that track, I'm safe.  It's easier to keep the little arrow indicator on top of a track line on your way home than it is to look for markers on a chart.  Bonus:  the GPS has an alarm you can set to sound if you get ___ feet off track.  We carry paper charts for the lakes, and check them before we move after dark, to make sure of the safest way back to the known safe path in the GPS.  We also carry a 5 or 10 million candle power spotlight.  There are some channels where  s with little tinnies and canoes like to sit right in the middle without marker lights.  Sweeping the area with the spotlight before we go through keeps everybody safe.  It's also really helpful for doublechecking that you're a safe distance from known hazards."
281151,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-18 16:42:00,835,"Navigating with gps brings new hazards,  overconfidence in the accuracy being one. Tangledlines is right to make tracks and return on them because the gps is more accurate in reference to its own waypoints than it is to charts. A new one is the guy that sets up the gps to an autopilot and  then goes below.  These fellas were keeping poor watch and way too fast, like one off the guys said they could have hit any moving hazard like a log or canoe.  I missed a canoe by about 5'coming dead slow into a harbor, 20' away you couldn't see them looking right at them. When I first spotted them they were paddling hard coming from under my bow, no light.  As for the operators cards, in the boating education field, that proves that you guessed your way through boating kindergarten. Before the operators card this coarse was originally for twelve and under."
281164,blaque,2008-12-18 17:47:00,2419, It also gets them paddling out of the way pretty quick as they think you are the authorities lol
280684,Cudz,2008-12-17 03:48:00,2652,Tell her we can't do as much damage with a 12' tinner and 6hp.  We can try though.  Just get her to double up on the life insurance.  My wife expects me to do stupid stuff.  I told her about the accident and she didn't bat an eye.  I am always do something dumb.  I currently have a broken ankle.
280713,nofish4me,2008-12-17 04:12:00,404,"How about this? GPS can really suck! Would you trust your GPS over anything Coast Gaurd has? I'm not going to say where, except NE corner of GB, but I was in camp and heard a boat coming towards camp, it was 10:00pm. Fog, so thick, we actually had to have a ""Camp Day""! The feller, that came into camp, runs a camp in the French River delta and he was surprised when he came upon us ('cause he knows us). He said it was the first time in 23 years he was never able to get home. He had GPS, and (it was so foggy) a Coast Gaurd escort, leading the way. Guess what? Coast Gaurd actually ran into an Island ( they were travelling at at a snails pace ). About 2/3 the way they left and he was on his own. He spent the night with us and left the next morning (breakfast was late for American Plan). Hehehe."
280717,Bernie,2008-12-17 04:16:00,3190, I have seen two boats come into our shop that had worse damage than the one posted here. Guess how they were navigating?
