279076,brian.millar,2008-12-13 18:18:00,12,Hello  all. Merry Christmas and happy Holidays....    I was wondering if I could get some ideas of a good fishing resorts around 4-5 hours of the Barrie Ontario area. I will be going with my 10 year old.  I would prefer to take my own boat if it will save a bit on the price. We are looking for All inclusive meals lodging etc.  Any suggestions of areas that anyone here had a good time with would be appreciated. thanks in Advance.  Brian PS; were looking at spending around the 500.00 dollar per person..
