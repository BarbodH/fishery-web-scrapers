281242,iceslayer,2008-12-18 21:37:00,97,"Parkhill looked like it was coming along good but the edge wont let you on.  There is about 1.5"" of ice on a slope for about 10ft out.  I did'nt feel like gettin a soaker so I went back to where I've got 6"" of solid ice..  Gonna munch a nice bluegill/crappie diner tonight.   Maybe I'll have to head up and visit Leechman way up north to fish a differant lake...   Cheers!"
