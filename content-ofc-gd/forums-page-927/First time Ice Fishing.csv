I live in the Toronto area and I'm just wondering if i could get a few suggestions on locations. Thanks for the help guy and hope everyone has a great winter."
274826,charlied,2008-12-03 03:25:00,584,Lake simcoe for perch when the ice is safe is your closest bet.
274828,douG,2008-12-03 03:28:00,2693,"Lake Simcoe is the obvious choice, with perch, lake trout, whitefish and pike.  Stay tuned here, or there for ice thickness and fish reports.    Hope this hleps."
274833,purekgw,2008-12-03 03:37:00,585,i also wonna try ice fishing this year does lake erie freeze over?
274840,sonny,2008-12-03 03:49:00,511,"When erie freezes over,,,there's nowhere better!!"
274870,GBW,2008-12-03 05:03:00,8460,I'll be out on the 'bog' for most if not all of my outings this year.
275451,Ramble,2008-12-04 17:03:00,713,"The Scu is a good time. I always catch something fishing there. Sometimes we catch lots of somethings, and sometime we even catch the somethings we are after!  Tight Lines  -R-"
275525,ccmtcanada,2008-12-04 19:56:00,7971,"Scugog hates me, but I hear about ppl doing well with Walleye there.  Simcoe for perch for sure!"
275527,wuchikubo,2008-12-04 20:06:00,1114,"The Bog hates me too, 3 yrs of ice fishing skunking for me, even when taken there by guys that have done well there in the past.  I've heard that there are some big slabs of crappie if you can find certain spots. If you search last season's pages you may get more info. It's all hear-say from me, so I won't go any further.  Lady Simcoe has been much nicer to me. But still looking for my first laker. Gotta go build me another hut though.  Good luck"
275534,purekgw,2008-12-04 20:38:00,585,so erie does freeze over then?
275549,Jen,2008-12-04 21:13:00,833,"  Yes Erie Freezes, but its usually push ice which is a chore to move over... Check out some of the ice fishing pictures from last year and you will see what I am talking about.      This is the Lower Grand in the winter months  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ter+ice+fishing"
275584,johnnyb,2008-12-04 23:31:00,3413,Wow -- that is some crazy ice!
280895,profisher25,2008-12-17 21:00:00,185,"K here are a few options:  Lake Simcoe- Perch, Pike, Bass, and Whitefish  Lake Scugog- Perch, Crappie, Walleye, Muskie, and Bass  Rice Lake- Walleye, Bass, and Muskie  Hope that helps ya out"
280901,Steel28,2008-12-17 21:15:00,160,  I believe Rice lake is closed for ice fishing.
280905,Rizzo,2008-12-17 21:26:00,4754,bass and muskie closed too
280921,ciceri,2008-12-17 22:20:00,535,"if you wanna catch something, Scugog is close enough and easy to access, go out to the middle, punch some holes and you're guaranteed Perch."
280962,Clampet,2008-12-17 23:58:00,1947,"Ahem Isn't Lake Skugog a manmade lake shaped like a doughnut, with the center being land, so how would you:""Go out into the middle.."" and fish?"
280963,BassAsin,2008-12-18 00:03:00,806,hahahahah good call clamp it di granny point that out to ya'll?
280977,Clampet,2008-12-18 00:32:00,1947, Watch it youg'un 
280981,Rich,2008-12-18 00:37:00,3927,"Long Point Bay on Lake Erie usually freezes over and is not push ice. If you put your time in, the perchin' is tremendous. Pike can be pretty good through the ice there too."
280982,Rich,2008-12-18 00:40:00,3927, lol.. Great help! Bass and muskie through the ice in sanctuaries. Never thought of that!
