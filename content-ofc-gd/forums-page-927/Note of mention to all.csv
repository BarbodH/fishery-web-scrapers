279370,Spiel,2008-12-14 13:41:00,9065,"....In many ways we truly have something unique here Marc. And if my memory serves me right you've always been there to offer up your services as well, for that I thank you personally. You and all the good folks here at OFC have shown time and time again what it means to be selfless.  My hats off to all who have given of themselves to help others."
279883,Blake,2008-12-15 15:46:00,418,I do agree fully whether it's an auction or just kind words and support this community is something special.  When my mom passed away almost 3 years ago many members reached out with words of support that helped.  As Rick's signature says PAY IT FORWARD it does seem to work.

279992,Big Cliff,2008-12-15 22:29:00,6899,"It is the people, from the members to the Mods, to the founder that make OFC so special and so very different from most sites out there. We are family!"
