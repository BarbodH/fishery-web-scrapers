280438,Roy,2008-12-16 22:40:00,13728,"What are they gunna do? Call that a scandal? I've had two cop cars from my municipality pull up in front of my house with their trunks loaded with firewood for me.  Sure beats thefts, murders and rapes eh?"
280442,Roy,2008-12-16 22:46:00,13728,What amazes me most is that the reporter for that beacon of information was not aware of the mayor's address.
280482,Spiel,2008-12-16 23:35:00,9065,"....Yep, small town papers are great, everything is an event in small towns. My sweety (on the right fools) made the front page of one last week while we were attending her grandmother's 100th birthday.   www.tavistock.on.ca"
280484,Rich Clemens,2008-12-16 23:38:00,3131,"Happens everywhere TJ.   Even in my small town, the mayor gets plowed out first it seems."
280495,Grimace,2008-12-16 23:47:00,2020,Maybe the reporter would like to switch mayors with Vaughn?
280504,outllaw,2008-12-17 00:00:00,1232,"man ,, you are fortunate thats big news. i love seeing small town canada is still alive."

280758,Daplumma,2008-12-17 12:11:00,1961,"Our mayor nearby(Washington DC)got plowed quite often.He was even caught on tape with a hooker.My favorite line..""the B*tch set me up""!He did his jail time and got re elected. Joe"
280759,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-17 12:19:00,1362, Where'd the cops steal the wood from Roy??
280760,SlowPoke,2008-12-17 12:22:00,2984,Plowing the driveway eh? That's how it started for Kwame Kilpatrick.
280761,Roy,2008-12-17 12:22:00,13728, The mayor's house.
280762,BigSmallie,2008-12-17 12:24:00,61,"If it was a small town, the Mayor may have been driving the snow plow with all the budget cutbacks."
280765,bushart,2008-12-17 12:35:00,2628,"Yeah ya gotta love small town ""Tattler Tribunes'  I made the front page 2x for painting the local legend lake monster.  Eat yer heart out Bobby Bateman (sigh)  Bushart"
280818,douG,2008-12-17 15:53:00,2693,"This is for Rafal.  C: Dad, how come old photographs are always black and white? Didn't they have color film back then? D: Sure they did. In fact, those old photographs ARE in color. It's just the WORLD was black and white then. C: Really? D: Yep. The world didn't turn color until sometime in the 1930s, and it was pretty grainy color for a while, too. C: That's really weird. D: Well, truth is stranger than fiction. C: But then why are old PAINTINGS in color?! If the world was black and white, wouldn't artists have painted it that way? D: Not necessarily. A lot of great artists were insane. C: But... but how could they have painted in color anyway? Wouldn't their paints have been shades of gray back then? D: Of course, but they turned colors like everything else in the '30s. C: So why didn't old black and white photos turn color too? D: Because they were color pictures of black and white, remember?  You're welcome."
280827,Hotrod2066,2008-12-17 16:16:00,40,"The funny thing is the Mayors husband works for the town and parks his plow in the driveway all the time. Some people have nothing better to do than to mind the buisiness of others, what a joke."
280828,irishfield,2008-12-17 16:18:00,26272,Read the paper... that's what it's all about... he dropped the blade to plow to the stable.. to get their own plow truck out supposably.
280850,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-17 17:59:00,10439,  It was a theft recovery and the insurance company didn't want it!!!
