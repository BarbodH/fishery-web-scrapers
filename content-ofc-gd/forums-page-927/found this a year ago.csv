280145,BassAsin,2008-12-16 04:22:00,806,just took these with my cell phone camera it had 9 scorable points and only one of which did not grow off the main beam!    
280181,Ramble,2008-12-16 07:00:00,713,That's a nice score for sure. I have a nice set of sheds myself i found years ago belonging to a beautiful 10 point. This year i found a single spike antler. 1 point about 7-8 inches long. They are always a treat to come across of any size.
280182,BassAsin,2008-12-16 07:05:00,806,"this is the most cherished for some obvious reasons being a possible 18 point buck but the second favorite is off of what would have been an 8 pointer but the brow tine being 11"" is what makes that shed a dandy"

280226,ketchenany,2008-12-16 14:44:00,3229,"I found one many years ago at a friend's cottage. Took it home made a plaque and had the family name carved out of it and mounted the antler. It now sits inside his front door and used as a hat rack, better there tha in my garage."
