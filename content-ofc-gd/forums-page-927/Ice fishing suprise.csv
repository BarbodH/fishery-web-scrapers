280163,Ramble,2008-12-16 05:18:00,713,I'll take that kinda surprise any day of the week.  -R-
280185,Rich,2008-12-16 10:59:00,3927,Nice! Wish I had some ice!
280186,Terry,2008-12-16 11:12:00,14456,nice surprise
280222,Mike Pike,2008-12-16 14:35:00,1332,"I can actually relate to your experience JMahon.  Last winter on Simcoe I was jigging a little #2 Jiggin' Rap with 3 1/2 pound test and hooked into a pike.  Man, when that reel starts to peel, you really hold your breath, eh!  Everything has to work out just right.  So what was the size of the hole you drilled?  6-inch?  That usually becomes a bit of a trick too!"
280224,Rizzo,2008-12-16 14:38:00,4754,"that is a very respectable pike too, nice job (and a bit of luck not getting bit off)"
280229,Leecher,2008-12-16 14:59:00,7832,Nice surprise for sure Got to hate that when it happens  Good job JMahon and thanks for sharing Leechman
280246,limeyangler,2008-12-16 15:45:00,5204,what a blast! On light tackle that must've been fun  did ya eat it?
280627,JMahon,2008-12-17 02:33:00,48,"Oh ya, it was definately a blast with the UL tackle!   I was fishing out of an 8"" hole...so I had a lil more leeway to get his head up!   & No, I didn't eat him...he's back out there waiting to be caught again sometime!"
