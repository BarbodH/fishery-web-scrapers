Many of these areas are wide open right now.  I guess, it looks like I picked a good time to be out of town.  There are a couple of spots with people still going out, but it isn't safe to be just walking around.  I may look around tomorrow afternoon when I get back, but I'll be spudding every step of the way.  One spot that I checked on Tuesday morning had decent enough ice before I left, but I only went 150 yards or so out.  I would imagine that you could be on 4"" one minute and 1/2"" the next right now and possibly not see it for the snow.  Safety first, fish second...  Jeff"
