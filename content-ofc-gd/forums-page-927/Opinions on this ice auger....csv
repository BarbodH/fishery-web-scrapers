280431,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-16 22:31:00,2050,  I was surfing the net looking at augers and came across icefishingpro.com - I'm not sure what caught my eye but something told me that I should check and see if they had any valuable information on their website...  man we need some cold weather down here...
280437,TJQ,2008-12-16 22:39:00,7806,hmmmfffff.....   i think they need parkas..
280447,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-16 22:49:00,2050,At first I thought it was a picture taken @ one of BITEME's Polar Bear Dip events!   You wouldn't catch me in the water mid-winter...no matter who jumps in first!
