I personally am a big fan of this magazine, and have subscribed to it for 2 years so far. I have learned much information from it, and I think that for those who want to learn more about fishing, this is the magazine for you. Before subscribing to Ontario Out Of Doors, I would buy monthly issues of In-Fisherman. Its once again a great magazine to learn from, and it introduces many new baits, tackle, and techniques.  Does anyone subscribe to any fishing magazines, and if so, what do you subscribe to?"
280900,BassAsin,2008-12-17 21:14:00,806,"i suscribe to OOD and BASSIN' the main reason for OOd id becasue with my job i am all over the province and can read articles of many places i have been to or close to, and BASSIN' becasue it has a few tips in it that i enjoy trying mainly because most of my fishing is for  bass as you can see by my albums"
280918,pike slayer,2008-12-17 22:07:00,1177,"i get the mag and i love them! i cant wait to get mine! actually i just got the latest one today!! i like it cause its ontario and it relates i dont care about catching salmon on the ocean like what other mags write about. its a great read, probably the only paper i enjoy reading"

280926,Beats,2008-12-17 22:33:00,543,"OOD is my favourite, followed by Outdoor Canada.  I would recommend both."
280936,jediangler,2008-12-17 22:52:00,1923,I pick up Musky Hunter and Esox Angler at the local convenience store. I've been re-reading articles from over 10 years ago. Gets me through the cold months.
280945,trapshooter,2008-12-17 23:09:00,1234,"I receive a subscription to OOD through my OFAH membership.  I was just reading in the most recent issue that the OFAH bought OOD from Rogers Media.  The next issue with be the first one under OFAH's ownership.  John Kerr is also the new Editor, replacing Matt Nicholls."
280955,Clampet,2008-12-17 23:44:00,1947,"I buy it off the newstand once in a while. I used to like InFisherman, but I find it is half the size it used to be."
280958,BassAsin,2008-12-17 23:49:00,806,that s mainly cuz she used to be the size of a city phone book!
