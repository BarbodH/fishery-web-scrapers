281020,Bernie,2008-12-18 02:03:00,3190,Surfing around and found this. Hadn't seen this one before. Maybe some others haven't either. May be handy for some of you out there. Not too sure whether to trust the thick ice idea from the colour.  http://www.ottertooth.com/Temagami/News/08/sat08-12-fc.htm  Why would Lake Wanapitei still be open? Is it deep and spring fed?
281030,Greencoachdog,2008-12-18 02:22:00,8163,Does this mean it isn't +17*C at 8:21 p.m. up there like it is here?
281032,BassAsin,2008-12-18 02:26:00,806,"nope, its warm here right now at -6 celsius, quite above what we've been having and as for lake whanipitae i dont know why it isnt frozen there is a good flow of water running through it but last time i drove through there the river was froze up a bit"
281035,BUSTER,2008-12-18 02:32:00,1336,wahnapitae is 400ft deep in the south west side
281036,Bernie,2008-12-18 02:34:00,3190," O sure. Make me feel bad for complaining about the cold a couple days ago and you saying ""well you live in Canada""........ and then you turn around and say THIS?"
