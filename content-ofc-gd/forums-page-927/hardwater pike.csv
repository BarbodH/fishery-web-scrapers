278568,snag,2008-12-12 05:23:00,1932,"Well done,  I'm curious at what it went for.  They sometimes vary on their prey early in the season.   (everything or just about!!)  Seriously,  What was the bait?"

280726,BassAsin,2008-12-17 04:41:00,806,i dont know if i can tell you that! but if you promise not to tell anybody i was using some frozen smelts we net out of the lake in the spring. give them the odd jig and we do well the average in that lake is about 5 lbs so big smelt are on the menu!
280772,ciceri,2008-12-17 13:08:00,535,"ok cool. I'd like to get into some pike, but last year i only used those little pinheads or whatever, big scoop for $5. I'll have to go big or go home."
