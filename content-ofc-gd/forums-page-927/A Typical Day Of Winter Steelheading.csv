Sunday saw seemingly perfect conditions: a dropping and clearing river after a huge blowout combined with warmer temps and light rain for most of the day. These conditions a month ago would have seen huge numbers of fish caught. Sunday I worked hard for just a handful of fish... That's the way it goes and frankly I wouldn't want it any other way. After doing this for 30 years I still havn't figured these fish out but that's what makes the sport interesting and the great days all the more treasured. It's always a bonus when you can get out this time of year, not freeze your digits off and catch a few fish! There were fish being caught somewhat consistently though...and for those that're interested the top bait seemed to be.....live minnows.              Looks like there might be some decent conditions to be had on Thursday this week...   Cheers,  Mike"
280219,fish_finder,2008-12-16 14:29:00,370,"Tough time of year for sure solo....  I was out Saturday to freeze my guides a little, saw a couple of fish, one hookup and that was it for the day.  No complaints, I'm always happy to get out there regardless of fish caught or not!"
