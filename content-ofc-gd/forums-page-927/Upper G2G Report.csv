However, we did get a 49 x 21 just before coming in so that was a nice way to end the year.  Great to meet you guys and go for dinner afterwards, cheers to a good day.  I will post the pic when I get it off the camera with adam's 49  Mark  "

280074,Rizzo,2008-12-16 01:16:00,4754,"thanks for all the kind words everyone. It certainly was great to get out there one more time and see some familiar and new faces. after all those years of getting skunked at the season closer, nice to see 3 fish caught"
280205,solopaddler,2008-12-16 13:20:00,8605,"Awesome fish, well done!"
280223,Rizzo,2008-12-16 14:36:00,4754,"doughboy, thanks for posting that brute. What a sweet fish. I'm trying to imagine how big that fish would look with a regular sized human holding it. Any update on how it was caught (trolling? depth?). One thing I forgot to mention is that ours was caught in around 23 feet of water"
280232,Joey,2008-12-16 15:02:00,9122,"Beauty fish Adam, woohooooo, congrats man!!!  Joey"

280620,graftongal,2008-12-17 02:24:00,145,"Thanks guys,  13"" Grandma, 2.1 mph, crunching bottom in 16' dropped off into 20' and she ate, bait was probably 17' down. Thanks for posting Mark. The other two fish caught are beauties also.  Adam"
280625,irishfield,2008-12-17 02:32:00,26272,"Heading upstream, Adam, I presume...since downstream was 6MPH in Neutral ! LOL"
280801,ehg,2008-12-17 15:02:00,2666,All those Niagara muskies are really chunky. That's a healthy looking fish. Thanks for posting the picture
280807,jwl,2008-12-17 15:22:00,1056,"hey thanks for sharing that new pic...that's definately a nice fish there  Walleyemen lost one at boatside just as everyone was coming in that rated right up there with the 2 big ones...our tactics now that season is closed  We started off by trolling an area I know can be productive.....he had a decent little one about 10 lbs on trolling 20fow with a deep diving Salmo-whitefish in perch pattern.....we continued to troll the area as I was marking some big fish on the finder for a few passes.   We changed up tactics for the afternoon,as I figure the fish where not too agressive in the cold and where not really into chasing down our baits.    I talked to Walleyemen about sticking to the same general area and switching it up to slow things right down.     He agreed with my choice on giving a small area a big workout, and I suggested that we switch it up to big soft plastics and give that a try.  Weapon of choice was 10 inch FinS minnows....white/silver and a rainbow pattern....rigged up like a large scale version simular to drifting for trout.    With the winds and current, I had to experiement a little with boat placement on how we where going to drift..it didn't take very long before Wayne had a fish in the boat for us after that.    We where drifting a transition area where the bottom changed from a mud flat to small rocks going from 6-7 fow, drifting out of that area along a slope where there is a drop to 15 then another drop on the rocky edge to 21.   The idea was just to have enough weight on the baits so that we could stay in contact with the bottom while the bait could swim freely with about a 3 foot lead.    We hooked up on 3 fish this way in about 2 hours, and I still marked a couple in the area right up until it was time to come in for the afternoon.     The key was hitting the area where it changed from mud to rocks,you could feel the bounce along the bottom to tell us we where in ""the right spot"".  I have a feeling had I decided on switching things up a couple hours sooner we could have been into a few more fish for the day.   hey, but that's musky fishing for you!!!   Thanks again guys for throwing this together, thanks again to Wayne for sticking it out with me and going on my better judgement for the day when it comes to the area we fished and the tactics we used, it's always a tough call when trying to be somewhat of the guide for the day, but I am glad I helped throw a pattern together and get one in the boat, although it is a bit frustrating when you hook into 4 and only one sees the net  Congrats to the other 2 guys who caught some pretty respectable fish out there!!!, and thanks for sharing all the pics"
279498,jwl,2008-12-14 17:21:00,1056,"Wayne it was a great time having you in the boat for the day, thanks for going the extra mile and showing up a bit early to grab me and the boat so my wife had the option of using our van for the day to go out with my kids. And also so we could show up a bit early and start clearing the ramp...boy did we ever need to do that!!!!  By the time everyone rolled in, which I must add I was very impressed that we had 7 boats out there for the day!!!, we had accomplished the mission and everyone was able to launch without any troubles.    Thanks to Corvette1 for popping the boat in first and being the icebreaker for the skim on the banks.  It was great to see that we had some action with only about an hour into the day!!!, it still amazes me when musky fishing sometimes when you are using huge baits with a load of hooks, and fish still get off the hook     That first one you had on sure tested the gear ratio on your reel when it bolted straight at the boat and didn't stop!!! That made my morning right there just to know that we found what we where looking for.    The Niagara River can be a tough code to crack as it is an ever changing body of water when it comes to currents and wind ect, it plays a huge factor in the day.  We sure managed to pass the day very well for a pretty chilly day, with some great conversation of fishing adventures from each other's season, and times gone past and some other common interests and family ect along the way.  We must have had a great time because for sitting out there all day long in the cold, we sure managed to pass the day pretty quickly.   Thanks for bringing the thermos of hot tea out there it was good to warm the belly if you drank it fast enough that it didn't get cold    By the way, you left it in my boat if you are looking for it, I found it when I was covering it up last night and organizing a few things....will figure out a way to get it to you soon!!!  Thanks alot for having the patience to stick by my decision of not doing so much exploring but sticking it out in basically the same area for the whole day, alot of people would give up on an area after a while, but I had to trust my instinct on this one,perhaps it wasn't the huge adventure you where looking for, but I feel I made the right choice.  I think you will have no problem remebering that general area as a future refference..specially seeing as we pretty much blacked out that whole section on your GPS with our path  I am also glad that in my decision to stick to a general area that we had some action.   I love when my instincts and expereinces pay off and I help people getb into some fish for the day.  I don't generally care who catches them as long as the targetted species see my boat, it tells me I must be doing somehting right out there...although I do like to catch them once in a while too  I had somewhat of a game plan for the day, with a couple different presentations in mind, my only regret is that we didn't change up to ""plan B"" sooner, I have a feeling we would have been into to even more fish.    Once I decided to change tactics and you agreed to give it a go, then there was where a couple other factors of river fishing come into play....where to put the boat when starting a drift...gotta experiment with the way the current is going to take the boat, and also where it is going to take your line in comparison, and yesterday the wind was also a big factor in this as it picked up throughout the day.  You need to have as natural as a presentation you can or you won't get the fish in my experience.  It did not take us too long to find it for sure.  In the short remainder of the day we had left after revamping our game plan we some great action in my books.  Everyone who targets muskies knows it can be a tough go on the best of days, many hours put into it, and many skunk days in the mix, so for us to connect with 4 fish in the day..the last 3 being within a short time of the afternoon, I would have to give us a big pat on the back for doing something right, although we lost 3  The last fish of the day you had on was sure a nice one...I would hazzard a good guess to be well into pushing a 4 footer and a good 25 lber no problems...I still cannot believe that it just seemed to get to the boat..open it's mouth and out pops you bait...and I even rigged that one up with a stinger as well   Funny part is I was talkign to you about that earlier in the day saying it has happened to me on a few occasions over the years while musky hunting...and it happened to us a couple times..maybe next time we should talk about how well they where hooked.  Thanks for sharing the pics...gotta admit it, you look pretty cold in that pic, hard to smile with your teeth chattering???..lol  Thanks again for chipping in all you help and being part of a great day out there Wayne, it was a pleasure sharing my boat for the day and doing our best to get into some Niagara hogs..next time bundle up and I can give you a lesson on catching the monster steelies on the other end of the river"
