280300,Woodsman,2008-12-16 18:17:00,1286,Just heard on the CBC news at noon that there is a new virus that has the capability to steal all your passwords. Affects Microsoft IE and Netscape. Microsoft is working on an emergency patch but in the meantime it is recommended that you use other browsers such as Firefox. This virus can bypass protection from your anti-virus/firewall software. As you move from site to site it records your passwords. Thought to be used for creating bootleg games but can also capture your banking info (ect.) if done online.  Be Careful: Rick

280503,Leecher,2008-12-16 23:59:00,7832,"Rick,  Do you know the name of the virus? Leechman"
280514,PatrickGG,2008-12-17 00:10:00,562,"It only Effects Netscape And IE, It's a good thing i only use Mozilla Firefox."
280566,Woodsman,2008-12-17 01:13:00,1286,Leechman: I believe it's called AZN Trojan.  Rick

280615,Zebco,2008-12-17 02:22:00,123,"I caught it on vista last weekend had to format, I put xp back on."
280655,Marko,2008-12-17 03:05:00,854,Figures its going to attack and bypass a Microsoft based program.....
280664,GBW,2008-12-17 03:18:00,8460,Safari is a good browser from the MAC folks for WIN users too...
280711,PatrickGG,2008-12-17 04:08:00,562,Seems like the virus was a threat in August 2007 :  http://www.sophos.com/security/analyses/vi...jdloadrazn.html  Looks Like this time it's aiming for Vista IE7 Users.
