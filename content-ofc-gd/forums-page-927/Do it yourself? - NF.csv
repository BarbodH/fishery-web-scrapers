280554,Spiel,2008-12-17 01:01:00,9065,"....A friend here on the board e-mailed me this some time ago and I thought I'd share it. All I can say wow, this guys invention is definitely got what it takes to be mandatory equipment on table saws!   SawStop"

280565,Bernie,2008-12-17 01:13:00,3190,First time you saw a damp board . WHAMMO! Good idea though.
280567,forrest,2008-12-17 01:14:00,1032,"That is an amazing invention!  Its a great failsafe, it even has consequences ($$$$)  if the safety is engaged so people are encouraged to still have to be careful.  forrest"
280568,forrest,2008-12-17 01:15:00,1032,  I never thought about that.  My table saw scares me to death so I avoid wet wood. Being scared is a great safety too.  forrest

280572,BUSTER,2008-12-17 01:19:00,1336,thats got to go into every high school shop class!
280574,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 01:20:00,8163, There's 2 things in this world I really hate... and one of them is wet lumber!!!
280576,Spiel,2008-12-17 01:23:00,9065,"  And what would the other be Glen, soft wood?"
280610,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-17 02:18:00,64, Yea that is a good idea a kid from a high school here in Peterborough chopped all 4 of his fingers off about 3 weeks ago. That invention could have prevented it.
280614,Leecher,2008-12-17 02:21:00,7832,Thanks Spiel for the amazing video....   A great invention for sure and it should be installed on all table saw
280629,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-17 02:36:00,0,A friend of mine had a buddy over to his shop to cut up some wood. Pack-All International (Canada) Inc at derry and Torbram.  I have to say it better at $300 a pop than a finger. The blade didn't even leave a scratch. The comment about damp wood is also correct. That can add up....
280631,Gerritt,2008-12-17 02:37:00,6129,"That system has been around for sometime now.. I remember seeing it about two years ago I think on sale @ Normand woodworking... a good system for sure... but it is not a saw many contractors would ever want to use... imagine replacing the module constantly?? nawwww...   Good idea for the average joe though!..  And as for the comment about being scared of a tool?  If you are scared to use do not use it.. nothing spells disaster quicker then someone who is nervous about a certain power tool... Get a buddy who is more comfortable with the tool....  All to often I have seen people let their nerves get the best of them.... that is when accidents happen.  Here is a tip for chisels... the really dangerous chisels are dull ones... So no... you cannot use my 600.00 Chisel set....  Great link Chris,  G."
280648,Joey,2008-12-17 02:58:00,9122,"Man, he's a brave lad.  Cool video Chris.  Joey"
280774,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 13:18:00,8163, People that hate inanimate objects... which is kinda screwed up because I have to hate myself!
