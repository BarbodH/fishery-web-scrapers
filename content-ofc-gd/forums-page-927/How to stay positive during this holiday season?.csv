281271,Roy,2008-12-18 22:54:00,13728,This thread started out as some pretty decent materials to make a fine thread. I'll lock it for now and clean it up a little. Back later.
281200,BITEME,2008-12-18 19:09:00,1969,"""EVERYTHING TURNS OUT GOOD AT THE END FOR THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN GOD!""  Okay I have to tell you this I really dont like to see this here I dont believe and never have If you believe keep it to yourself or go to your church of choice and hang out with people in kind Things will work out for me in the end because I believe in MYSELF and why should I trust in somnething that does not exist I EXIST I TRUST ME AND MAYBE YOU AND MAYBE OTHERS NOT A ""CREATOR"" Please cease and desist I promise you this will get ugly  Peter"

281204,ricoboxing,2008-12-18 19:29:00,398,"too late, u just made it ugly"
281207,douG,2008-12-18 19:34:00,2693,Why is a statement of personal belief a threat to others?  Honestly.
281208,BITEME,2008-12-18 19:35:00,1969,"  just keeping it ""real"""
281210,fishing n autograph,2008-12-18 19:35:00,2540," So does suffering from a mental illness make a person dysfunctional? I hate to break it to you, a person doesn't choose to be mentally ill. Working 10 years in the mental health field I can tell you that many of the choices a child makes is from the mistakes by the parents.  Many people take anti depressants and many types of psychotropic or mood altering medication because they need it, not because they are bad people...."
281217,danbo,2008-12-18 19:42:00,2646,"Yo BM..what is ""real"" to you is the minority here.  You deny your Creator & he will deny YOU.  There are no athiests in a war-time foxhole either.."
281224,OhioFisherman,2008-12-18 20:23:00,6623,"All you can do is keep your chin covered and try to roll with the punches, stuff happens, deal with it the best you can and learn from the experience.  GWB throwing around the D word today, don`t know if his financial moves are working, Wall Street and the banking industry seems more intent on guaranteeing their own pay day."
281230,bushart,2008-12-18 21:06:00,2628," I'm not quite sure why the attack on his beliefs.  I am not an english major but he is only stating his beliefs and not telling you what you should or should not believe in.  You choose to not believe fine, but it appears you have taken a stand as aggressor here to tell the world your point of view. ""going to get ugly""---I see no ill will in his message. In this season I'll take his message over yours---touch less confrontational.  Bushart"
281234,Rich,2008-12-18 21:14:00,3927,"Let's see, I don't own a house, don't own a vehicle, have no outstanding loans and a full time job in an industry that I don't see dying in the next 60 years. Add to that I have a healthy family and I'd say I'm a very lucky guy and trust me I count my blessings every day!  The biggest of the blessings is that my wife loves to fish!!"
281235,Big Cliff,2008-12-18 21:15:00,6899,"Yesterday is history and until they invent time machines you can't go back and change it so accept it for what it is. What is done is done!  Today is a blessing, make the most of it for tomorrow, today will be history too.  Tomorrow has yet to come and for many it never will so I guess that today is the only day that counts. How would you like to be remembered by your children, friends, family?????? Get on with it, make the most of it, Live and give a part of you, it will be the seed of tomorrow!  Believe in what ever you want to believe in, to deny that there is a superior ""life force"" is un reasonable, it is like trying to deny infinity. You can't hold it or see it but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exhist.  As I wish you a Merry Christmas, I only ask that you respect my right to believe in what I do believe in and that because I feel it is something special and you are special, I would like to share it with you. If you are of another faith and wish to extend your greatings or well wishes to me, I will not be offended but rather honored that you would care to wish me well.  So for those of you that care; Merry Christmas! For those of you that are of a different faith; may the blessings of your maker be upon you! And for those of you that choose only to believe in yourself; you have a tough role to fill, I pray that you will have the strength to carry your load when the time comes! If you don't, all you have to do is ask and I would willingly share it with you!  Peace to all!"
281239,bigugli,2008-12-18 21:27:00,6138,"What is life without love and laughter.  In these times we need them more than ever.  Despite all that happens around us, we have lives to live out. What point is there if we do not have hope in a better tommorrow. Make do and enjoy the blessings you have.  Despite all the bad things that are going on in our family's life we are still here together, loving each other, and having a laugh or two when we can, and we know that there is always the promise of tommorrow.  Having said all that, I need some feel good music. "
281247,BITEME,2008-12-18 21:57:00,1969,I dont regret my belief not a stand as an agressor just taking a stand freewill and all Im getting tired of hearing it day in and day out being a non believer pretty much dooms you to being a leper I will bend over backwards to help pretty much anyone I do care and i will carry on always it is just the way im wired if im in a foxhole i will keep shooting if i were to have my tagline as godless and proud of it would'nt that just go over like a lead balloon everyone needs something to believe in and it just happens to be me and my fellow humans And I do wish everyone a very safe and merry christmas Peace out

Why don't you take it to PM's or something so that his thread doesn't get locked up!"
281264,BUSTER,2008-12-18 22:42:00,1336,sorry to be an azzzzz      cheers all
281266,danbo,2008-12-18 22:47:00,2646,"this is exactly what is wrong with humanity. We are divided on everything, every issue. The TRUTH is we all are a part of the whole. The universe, the source of life. Every single life counts..good or bad. When you finally discover that you are an Eternal being of spirit/consciousness..you will realize that the physical body is but one stage of your existence. Matter cannot be created nor destroyed. Study quantum physics & it all comes full circle..that the Universe was INTELLIGENTLY designed.  Merry Christmas y'all   (This Universal law even applies to people who buy Shimano products..   )"
