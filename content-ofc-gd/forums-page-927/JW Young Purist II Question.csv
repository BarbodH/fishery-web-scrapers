281007,Manc,2008-12-18 01:41:00,1,Any JW Young user knows how to take the spool off the Purist II 2051 reel? I see there is a bigger screw on the back plate and a really tiny screw on the front attached with micro-drag system. After i removed the big screw on the back plate the spool is still attached with the reel. I didn't want to force it out and mess up the bearings and whatnot.  some experienced advice would help.  thankx

On the front of the spool where the drag is, one side has a small wheel (drag adjust) and the other side just a spring.  You have to pull back with your finger the spring side and it will release the spool.  Its hard to explain but if you mess with that part you will figure it out.  Burt  Edit:  Here's a pic, arrow pointing at the spring side, and direction to pull away from the center of the spool, that should take it off.  "
