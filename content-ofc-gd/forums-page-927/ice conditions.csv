280531,johnnyb,2008-12-17 00:27:00,3413,I did hear that there were a few brave (?! not sure if that's the right word) souls on the ice near Guilford on the weekend...wouldn't think that the warm spell helped anything though.  not sure about Little Lake....wanna drive over and let us know?

281123,Fisherman,2008-12-18 14:18:00,7201,"Don't now how accurate they are but, the Barrie A Channel mentioned a possibility of up to 50cm of snow between Friday-Sunday, if that comes down, it will sink the ice and then have nothing but slush."
281261,steelhedrmatt,2008-12-18 22:36:00,278,"I was fishing Little lake on Sunday with 8"" of ice...  4 white / 4 black.  ATV's and sleds were out also.  Seen some yahoo out from guilford about 100 yards or so from open water.  Remember,,, spud, walk. spud, walk.  Please be safe everyone!!"
