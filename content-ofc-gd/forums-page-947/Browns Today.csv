263242,irishfield,2008-10-30 02:39:00,26272,Hey Mike.. wanna go Muskie fishing. I'll bring all the gear... you bring that horseshoe of yours along bud !

263255,Ramble,2008-10-30 03:39:00,713,Beautiful photo's Solo. If you have some other shots along that line i'd like to see them. Don't get to see to many good pictures of browns.  You've been on a pretty good streak this year. Keep it up!  -Dave
263259,limeyangler,2008-10-30 03:45:00,5204,  DITTO   Your doing it again solopaddler...making me green with envy.  Thanks for posting...the colours on those fish are awesome.
263295,solopaddler,2008-10-30 11:47:00,8605, I'd love to seriously! I think I'd need that horeshoe for muskie fishing. Ehh...not so much for steelhead fishing.
263337,strakey,2008-10-30 16:24:00,78,"Solo I'll have to agree with the other board members, you make this way to easy and we all become jealous. It leaves me to wonder if your job sits on the edge of some fabulous river where you can cast out the window and work at the same time.?? Man some guys have all the luck"
263338,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-30 16:41:00,10439,  Actually his job sits on the edge of acres of ashphalt!!!!
263344,wuchikubo,2008-10-30 17:13:00,1114,"Mike, nice pics, another jealous angler here. I've yet to hook up with a brown (ever). I'd like to join your ""fishing for browns 101 class"" when you start one up.  Seriously, nice fish.  Stan"

263425,douG,2008-10-31 00:03:00,2693,"Mike is the generousest pro I would ever hope to meet.  Just offer gas and gweeches, and be ready to go at the drop of a hat, and you will learn stuff, and catch many many feesh.  No ham but salami and pastrami are well received."
