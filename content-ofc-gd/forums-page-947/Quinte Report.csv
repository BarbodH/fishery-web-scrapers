This is one of the Walleye 32 1/4 ""   8 Rod spread   14 1/2 Lb. Sheephead, my buddy had a hard time lifting.  Most fish caught between Kieth Shoal and Bat Cave. Our other Buddy's caught 5 Walleye. Their biggest was 32 1/2"" All fish were caught trolling. We tried Thompson's Pt. and marked lots of fish. But the guys didn't want to jig, just troll. Next time down in Nov. I'll be jigin. :"
