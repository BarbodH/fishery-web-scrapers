I have a 1997 ford escort station wagon thats been great for me as a commuter vehicle but today I witnessed something strange that I cant explain although I'm not a mechanic. Heck I'm not even a backyard mechanic..Went for lunch today in the car and returned to work, but when I got inside the car to go home before starting the car I noticed the heating fan blowing and seems it was working for a few hours as the car was parked. Upon further inspection I noticed the headlights were on the whole time as well..Battery was dead of course and now I have to pull  a battery cable when I got home from work to prevent boosting the car.. Whats up with that?"
262848,Fisherman,2008-10-29 00:23:00,7201,"Probably something to do with the famous Ford ignition switch dilemma, park it in your garage and you're taking chances on your house burning down.  Ignition not turning off everyhting, relays on allowing heater, lights and anything else on relays to function."
262850,sturgman,2008-10-29 00:25:00,249,"Thanks fisherman.. I was wondering if it was a ""switch"" problem but nothing in my Haynes manual suggests that.."
262851,irishfield,2008-10-29 00:25:00,26272,Ignition switch is worn out... power contacts staying together even after turning key off and removing.  Try wiggling the key. If it's not that then it's a relay stuck and you'll find that in your fuse panel. Look for Access relay.. or ignition relay tagging. Pull it out.. lights go out. Give it a light hit and put back in.. so how it goes but time to buy a new one if that's it.
262853,Bondar,2008-10-29 00:26:00,817,"my buick had a problem that the heater would stay on when the car was off , it turned out to be a heater control module it was located in the air box under the hood up against the firewall , i am by no means a mechanic just a similar situtaion"
262858,Bernie,2008-10-29 00:39:00,3190,Couple questions Sturgman. Could you tell if it was the daytime running lamps on or the brighter regular lights? Daytime running light modules are notoriously bad in those years. Could be back feeding a circuit. Also have seen blower fan relays stick on these. Anything else staying on that could lead us to where the short is?
262863,sturgman,2008-10-29 00:44:00,249,Thanks Fella's.. Bernie. Im almost positive it is the daytime running lights and everything is peachy.. Radio included
262875,Bernie,2008-10-29 01:09:00,3190,According to Mitchell Manual the daytime light module is located  behind right side of dash at the top of the kick panel. If you can find it unplug it and see if the problem goes away. If it does- great. If not try disconnecting the blower relay mounted behind the left side of the dash near the kick panel. This one may be harder to locate though.
262884,Wild,2008-10-29 01:28:00,704,First get a voltmeter and probe the relay (s) primary terminals with the ignition off and then on. This will help to isolate the bad component.
262888,sturgman,2008-10-29 01:33:00,249,Thanks for all the help guys.. This gives me something to go on
262936,HTHM,2008-10-29 03:52:00,4082,A gallon of gas and a match should cure it
263052,Billy Bob,2008-10-29 17:08:00,5865,Do you have a remote start on this vehicle. Sometimes these remote starts are the leading problem with what you described.  Bob
263072,sturgman,2008-10-29 18:36:00,249," Thanks Bob, but no remote start on the car..."
263076,Raf,2008-10-29 18:44:00,3495,similar thing in my jeep.. was the drl module.  unplugged it and all is good.  not going to be replaced anytime soon. on the jeeps unplugging it also disables your highbeam indicator on the dash so be aware of that.
263143,Muskieman,2008-10-29 21:57:00,2472,Eh  B ....  come see me at work we'll figure it out    RFS  :Gonefishing:
263210,sturgman,2008-10-30 00:35:00,249,Thanks everyone...  Randy I'll see ya fer 2..
263466,Bernie,2008-10-31 01:46:00,3190,Any success with the repair Sturg?
