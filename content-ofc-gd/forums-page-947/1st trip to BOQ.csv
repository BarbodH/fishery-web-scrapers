262949,Streamerguy,2008-10-29 10:01:00,121,"Hello All,  I have been waiting a long time to actually see and fish BOQ for the first time.A friend/co-worker mentioned to me last month if id be interested in going and the day finally came on thurs night,we left way to early as we had to pick up the boat at another friends house and didnt want to show up at midnight waking everyone up!!  We picked up the boat and headed out to timmies in welland around 9:30 pm,couple extra lg coffee's and we were off.....    We arrived in Picton just after 2am(time we were suppose to leave)and picked up a few zzzz's before sun up! Started to get things going around 7am.Pep getting the boat ready        We headed down to the Glenora ferry and made our way across       The day started off with no wind and as soon as the boat went in to the water,the wind picked up! Started trolling the west side of the ferry,everything was great but the wind started to pick up even harder... being on a 14ft aluminum boat trolling at low speeds didnt set well with my guts!! Well i dont have to tell ya what happened next but we ended the trolling early and headed out to the drug store for some gravol!! It was time to get our room anyways so we headed out to the sportmans,unpacked and picked up a map. With the winds blowing so hard we decided to leave picton bay to the bigger boats and head out to Deseronto and fish the telegraph narrows.  We didnt catch any eyes or pike but did manage to hit the perch heavy,we caught over 100 but only a few will hit the pan       Time to get back to the room and i was told not to leave her out    here's where she slept for the weekend,at least she didn't snore, pep!!    Next morning after watching the weather channel,it was not looking very good,rain,wind,white caps.. ok back to room watch some fishing shows i guess until this clears up..... few shots i took from the launch that morning       Back on the water at 2:30 until sun down,2 days down and still no eyes or pike,only a few perch this was our leaving shot      Last day.....Sunday morning,sun comes out and the winds have died down a bit.We got out at 7am and i started casting again for that pike,while pep was still fishing for perch and walleye.After 2 hours i noticed we forgot the net...Oh well !!The perch have been hitting everything and anything (micro tubes,pink worms,anything small)all weekend long,so i decided to stop pike fishing after 3 hours of casting and go after the perch with pep. Take off my leader line and rig up a small jighead with a little red pom-pom to see if the perch will hit this egg imatation.I dropped it over the boat and before it could hit bottom.... My rod bent over and my reel screamed....I don't think thats a perch pep? After 3 good runs and no net i landed my PB pike @ 31''....Beautiful lookin fish,not huge by any means but a beauty indeed.....      The funny thing is,iv'e never caught a pike or musky when fishing for them...it seems when i go fish for other species i catch a pike or musky.I must be doing something wrong? A POM-POM  Caught some more perch for the fish fry and headed back home!!     No walter's this time but i had a great time non the less,beautiful area to visit and i will be back!!  Hope you enjoy cheers Streamerguy"
262954,Greencoachdog,2008-10-29 10:32:00,8163,Real nice report!!!  Some nice pics and fish!!!
262980,jwl,2008-10-29 12:51:00,1056,"cool report man, it may not have been exactly the type of fishing trip you where after, but goes to show you that you can adapt to the situation at the time and make a great trip of it.  Nothing wrong with a haul of perch like that, and catching a PB pike along the way.  You guys should have put that Mariner to bed standing up  Quinte is a bit behind right now for the walleye fishin, water a bit too warm still, don't dispair you guys definately aren't the only people to not see any walleye on your trip, the weather didn't help you much either"
263002,johnnyb,2008-10-29 13:41:00,3413,Nice report -- love the sundown shot of the bridge!  And certainly nothing wrong with a mess of perch to fry up --- just means you get to go back again...soon!
263014,trapshooter,2008-10-29 14:51:00,1234,Congrats on your PB pike.  Tough goin on the walleye but  you'll be back I'm sure.

263028,Wild,2008-10-29 15:47:00,704,Great perch and there will be plenty more to come out of there. But you know... a true die hard would have cuddled up with the motor to keep it warm on cold nights
