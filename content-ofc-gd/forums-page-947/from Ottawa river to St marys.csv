Thanks again Rod ,had a blast with you and you dad and learned a lot including how to net your fish  anytime  Saturday Morning yougest son and I were on the road before 4am headed to the Soo to meet up with Pikeie and spend 1 1/2 days fishing the St Marys.  Arrived at 10 am to find Pikeie fast asleep in his dorm , cell phone off .Luckily we knew which window was his .Couple of 'wanna go fishing' and he was up .Must be those late night'study'sessions.  Short drive downtown and a 10 minute walk past the locks Huron  Superior  we are at the river.  My second cast something slams my chartruse cleo , few minutes of fight and man do they pull, it was landed . Not the prettiest looking fish as they are nearing the end of the spawn     Fish kept us busy with 30-40 on and 15 or so landed.   couple of scenery shots    took a break for lunch then fished the after noon till about 5 , action definatly had slowed down .  Next morning (sunday) was cold and wet , we planned to fish till about noon. On the walk in we meet up with a fellow fisherman on his way out with a nice steelhead ,they are starting to move in and we we see one or two that morning moving by. a few more fish and we are about to call it a day when my youngest hooks what was probably the biggest fish of the day , unfortunatly it gets away on him and soon spools him snapping his line. Luckily Pikeie was downstream , grabbed the PP line and managed to land the fish   That was it for the day , another quick lunch and we drive home in the rain and snow . Spoons ( chartruse ,blue white ,pink cleos ) all worked well. Pikeie was fly fishing or drifting roe bags with his float rod ,Numbers of fish caught were pretty evenly split between the 3 of us. Next year we will go up earlier for the pinks or later for steelhead  Lots of driving some new friends and fishing with my sons , can 't be beat  TB"
