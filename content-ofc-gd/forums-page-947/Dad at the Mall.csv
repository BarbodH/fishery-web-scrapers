Dad at the Mall  I took my dad to the mall the other day to buy some new shoes (he is 92). We decided to grab a bite at the food court. I noticed he was watching a teenager sitting next to him.  The teenager had spiked hair in all different colors: green, red, orange, and blue.  My dad kept staring at him. The teenager would look and find him staring every time.  When the teenager had had enough, he sarcastically asked, 'What's the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?'  Knowing my Dad, I quickly swallowed my food so that I would not choke on his response, knowing he would have a good one, and in classic style he did not bat an eye in his response.  'Got drunk once, and had sex with a peacock. I was just wondering if you were my son.'     Not sure how it felt.(sex with a peacock) Misfish is SCRACTHING HEAD. LOL, but man that is so funny. "

263216,Wild,2008-10-30 01:00:00,704,"  Your dad should have seen this guy yesterday, tight black shiny vinyl goth outfit with 6 in boots, white makeup with black eyes and matching hair, standing in the post office getting greyhound tickets with his accessorized girlfriend. All I could do is snicker walking past the two.   Then I remember the long hair hard rock days of old and began missing the good times..."
