The wind sure made perching difficult. Could not keep my line taught to feel the hits on my bottom rig. Just kept feeding the perch. So picked up my bags and sought out a few spots out of the wind. I finally found a spot and the fish were stacked. Went through a good 40 or more minnows and a dozen worms. The weeds were still pretty thick so I went back to float fishing in 20 ft. of water. Of course some fish would have to be sacrificed to appease my appetite. Besides they wouldn't have survived  There were a lot of dinks and a lot of very large rockbass in the mix as well."
263162,Rich,2008-10-29 23:23:00,3927,Good stuff! I'll be out perchin' next Monday with my boss. Glad to hear they're hitting (even though it's in a completely different area)
263174,Leecher,2008-10-29 23:55:00,7832,Great report and pics Bruce  Nice little collection for the frying pan Thanks for sharing Leechman
263188,bigugli,2008-10-30 00:10:00,6138, Strictly from shore. I'm not allowed out in the boat by myself no more.
263200,Wild,2008-10-30 00:24:00,704,Nice color to them Bruce any particular recipe you have in mind for them?
263227,bigugli,2008-10-30 01:25:00,6138,I guess I'm saving the perch for a little pike derby and pot luck fry some of my fellow Niagara nutbars are holding on Sunday.
263231,Greencoachdog,2008-10-30 01:34:00,8163,"Another fine mess o' Perch Mr. Ugli!!!  Do you always fillet those panfish?... have you ever tried just scaling, gutting, and cutting the heads off and then frying them? That's the way I always do my smaller panfish and I find there's much less waste, takes less time to clean them, and the best part is I get to nibble on the fried tails and fins!!!  Fried fins and tails are kinda like potato chips!... once ya start ya can't quit 'til they're all gone!!!!"
263278,bigugli,2008-10-30 08:15:00,6138,Years back I would cook fish whole and pick out the bones. I then had to have bones removed that were lodged in my throat. Not a pleasant experience doing the scope thingy. I kinda get a bit queasy when I get any bones in my mouth now.  So I fillet all my fish.
263310,Greencoachdog,2008-10-30 13:05:00,8163," You et the bones?  You're not s'posed to do that!... and you're wasting all those beautiful tails and fins!  No need to go to the doc to have the bones removed, just post pics here and we can instruct your wife on how to remove them!  I grew up eating the fried smaller fish whole, I guess it's a southern thing though. Whenever you order catfish in the local restaurants down here they ask you if you want fillets or ""whole"".  Still tryin' to teach Ol' Yeller (she's    ) how to eat whole fried Crappie and catfish without gettin' a mouthfull of bones, usually have to fillet a couple up for her. She looks at me like I have crawdads crawlin' out of my ears when I eat the tails!"
263316,bigugli,2008-10-30 13:59:00,6138,"I remember a few restaurants asking me if I wanted my cats whole or filleted. Every time I've run South I make sure I get a few good feeds of catfish. Especially if it is an 'All You Can Eat' joint.  Like in my post ,I used to fry fish whole, we grew up the same way in that regard. I just find filletting easier for me. That way I don't risk ruining my appetite."
263325,Roy,2008-10-30 14:50:00,13728, There's just something about a waiter asking me that question that would make me stay very far away from there.
263328,jwl,2008-10-30 15:32:00,1056,"hey Bruce...no prefishing man...cheater  , you really don't need to bring any fish for the cook out..but if you are,let me know....I will be bringing a bunch of walleye to cook up, if you are bringing fish too, I won't take so much out"
263512,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 10:37:00,8163, That question is only ok when asked by someone with a southern accent!
263529,bigugli,2008-10-31 11:55:00,6138,"Preferably, a cute, blue eyed, blonde, belle.  As they bat them big long lashes while asking you, "" would you like taters or grits with that, honey child?"""
263530,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 12:08:00,8163, Buxom!... you forgot Buxom!!!
263536,bigugli,2008-10-31 12:38:00,6138,Keepin with the Southern theme that this conversation has taken Sah!  I was trying to be a gentleman and keep this conversation civil for the benefit of the fair ladies that do frequent this site
263547,limeyangler,2008-10-31 13:27:00,5204,"Nice haul of perch there Bigugli. Really nice colour to 'em. The lake i live on is stained a coffee colour from all the clay...looks like a giant Timmies double/double with islands in it...so the perch in have no colour at all, they look pretty sick actually...lol."
263571,bigugli,2008-10-31 15:13:00,6138,"Walleye and pike in muddy waters down here get that same washed out, colourless look."
