262758,lookinforwalleye,2008-10-28 21:19:00,4399," Glen is correct the regs are clear, you can fish musky with a conservation license.  The biggest problem with this urban myth is the people that should know the law don`t, instead they convey their own opinions instead of sticking to the law.  The biggest offenders are the police, last year on Scugog I was approached for a spot check and after my boat passed the check he inquired if we had caught anything and I mentioned my son had caught a musky and thats when the officer informed me that it was illegal to fish for musky with a conservation license and thats when I politely informed him that is perfectly legal to fish for musky with said license and it clearly states that in the regulations and I had a copy on board if he would like to check he declined."
262766,camillj,2008-10-28 21:34:00,1988,I always get the sportsmans licence ... not only is it worth the few bucks extra .... I happen to think musky... especially those 50+ girls ... tastes almost as good as sturgeon (flame away ladies )  Seriously though ... what is the difference between this and fishing on the upper credit where it is 100% catch and release ONLY ... what no speck pics allowed .. yea right !!!
262802,danbo,2008-10-28 22:52:00,2646,"It is the dumbest regulation in the books. So for the extra $10 of the ""Sportsman's License"" ,I could catch & keep & cook a legal-sized Musky everyday of the open season!!! But if I don't give them $10 bucks, then I should release a spent fish, so the Seagulls can peck it's eyes out??? MNR needs an Overhaul by some real Sportsmen instead of geekster Biologists & old fat bureacrats!!!! Money grubbers! The license fees don't go to the Resources!"
262820,Terry,2008-10-28 23:36:00,14456,"the answer is    yes here is cut and paste from mnr and link 3. The catch and possession limit for muskellunge is zero (0) if I have a Conservation Fishing Licence. Does this mean I can't fish for these species? Not at all. A catch limit is the number of a species that you are allowed to catch and keep in one day. (A possession limit is the total number of a species that you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit and so on.) As long as you immediately live release any zero (0) limit fish you catch during the open season you may legally fish for them using a Conservation Fishing Licence.  This holds true for such species as muskellunge, sturgeon, Atlantic salmon and aurora trout. Immediate live release is the key.  However, those who fish for muskellunge with a Conservation Fishing Licence should understand and be prepared to deal with the fact that occasionally muskellunge are injured beyond being able to be successfully live released. What would you do with the fish if it could not swim away?  Or, what would you do as the angler if you caught the world record muskie (something that is quite possible in several Ontario waterbodies) on a Conservation Fishing Licence? It would have to be released.  For these reasons and others, most ardent muskellunge anglers purchase the Sport Fishing Licence. The added bonus is that their licence dollars can help improve future muskellunge fisheries.   http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fishing/faq.html#N10037  so print a copy of this and the link and when that one CO tells you no...say the only no is the fact you don't kNOwn your job mister CO and show him , now piss off you bug me.....LOL"
262822,mattyk,2008-10-28 23:51:00,2110,"If you cant take a picture or use a net to release with a conservation license, then you shouldn't be allowed to take a picture of any muskie that is under the size limit. So if your fishing a waterbody that has a size limit of 48"" or 54"" or is catch and release only does that mean no pictures, and you cant use a net to land your fish, then release it? How would you land a 50+ inch muskie without a net? I need some clarification about this, any insight?"
262828,DANIMAL,2008-10-29 00:04:00,215,"  I know its stupid but technically that is the rule for pictures, but most CO's wont bust you for it. As for a net you are allowed to use one only for the purpose of getting the fish unhooked and realeased quicker and easyer."
262840,misfish,2008-10-29 00:13:00,29133,"I asked this question back on the old board,(BOY DAY JA VUE)as I was heading out for my first musky adventure. I got the same answers pretty much,,,,,,,,,except about the pi ss off one.LOL Ever since,I have bought the full/sports lic. Save    and having to answer questions if they arised."
262841,Terry,2008-10-29 00:14:00,14456,"and I believe you can take a photo according to the mnr and they have had people  holding juvenile muskie cut and paste Handling    * Keep the fish in the water as much as possible and handle the fish gently. * Reduce handling that removes the slimy protective coating on fish. * Do not squeeze or touch the gills. Grasp the fish just behind the gill covers. For panfish and bass, it is best to grasp the fish by the lower lip. * Use long-nose pliers to remove the hook quickly without tearing or injuring the fish. If the fish is hooked deeply, cut the line and leave the hook in when the fish is released. * Never put a fish that you may release on a stringer, use a functional livewell or release the fish immediately. Remember that all fish kept (in a livewell, on a stringer, etc.) and not immediately released count toward your daily catch and retain or possession limit.   Photographing    * Be ready ahead of time! Take pictures quickly, minimizing the amount of time the fish is out of the water. * Hold the fish in a horizontal position, supporting its weight with your arm and hands. Do not hold large fish in a vertical position.   Releasing    * Revive the fish before letting go. Hold the fish upright in a swimming position in the water, moving the fish slowly forward and backward so water runs through the gills. * Ensure the fish is breathing and can swim away under its own power before it is released.    Remember the future of fishing is in your hands!"
