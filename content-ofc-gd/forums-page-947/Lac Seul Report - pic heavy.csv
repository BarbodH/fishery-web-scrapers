262969,tinbanger,2008-10-29 12:00:00,1028,"Way overdue report from this past summer  The family vacation this year was a drive to Dryden to see my Sister and family .The first stop was S.S. Marie to scope out the college that Pikeie is now attending.Spent a couple of days checking out the city , droppping off resumes and lounging around the pool. Rained most of the time .  Up early and on our way to Dryden via the US . Had deceided this to take this route up due to lower gas prices and flatter terrain , hauling the boat , 5 people and gear was gonna take a bite out of the wallet . About $800 in fuel costs for the two weeks was bit hard to swallow none the less  Arrived in dryden and caught up with the family .The next few days hanging put and doin a little fishing as my Sister lives on the water northwest of dryden.   One of our planned excursions was to the famous Lac Seul area . We loaded the boats and packed the gear the night before and  off bright and early the next morning. Bit of an education on loading my bro in laws boat on a roller trailer ..oops sorry bout the prop .Luckily he had new one We arrived at the launch the following  morning to find water levels way higher than usual but not quite high enough as my brother inlaw dropped his nice new crestliner right on the launch ( damn roller trailers) fortunatly no damage but  couple of red faces for sure . Launch was busy but everyone was on the water in short order.   the 30 min boat ride was interesting ,last fifteen minutes or so was nothin but burnt trees ,Area was ravaged by fire 8-10 years ago .It was amazing to see the size of the fire ,islands in the middle of the river several hundred yards from shore burnt . There were little pockets of bush that had survived but for the most part nothin but burnt sticks. Good wind blowing meant for some rough water but a good dry ride    We stopped on our way to our final destination to try out a small bay area . Caught a few small fish but decided to push on .Glad my Bro in laws buddy knew his way around .Lots of submerged rocks ,logs etc.We followed thier tracks exactly  Finally arrived at the area that we planned to fish .Within the first hour we were hooking up with some fish .Kept enough 'legal' fish to have a shore lunch . no shortage of firewood thats for sure  After Lunch we decided to split up a bit having two boats we though we would try and cover more water .My Brother in law headed across the large bay area and we decided to fish the points and drop offs right near the lunch spot .Paid off with some of the largest fish of the day .  True to his name Pikeie started to target Pike and ended up with a couple of nice fish .   Even a decent walleye on a large spinner bait.   What we though wa shaze started to increase after lunch and we started to notice a distinct smell of smoke   we did put out our fire right ?  Turns out ( as we heard later) it was smoke from fires in Saskatchewan .  As always the day went by by way to quick and we returned back to camp /One day is definatly not enough time fro this fishery .   Walleye caught mainly on jigs tipped with minnows or white tube jigs , pike on spinner baits or large (5"") spoons.   tb"
