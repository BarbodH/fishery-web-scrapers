I'm no linguist, but somebody has got to know! Does anybody know? I'd be surprised if nobody knew!!!  No one?  Oh well!  http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/noone.html"
263288,Whopper,2008-10-30 11:10:00,2174,"Don't know why Rick would have to chime in on this, I think the elders have gotten the point accross."
263331,Headhunter,2008-10-30 15:56:00,5703,"I talked to Terry last year at the ""Q"" gtg about spam and he told me he prefers Kwik! HH"

262587,fishing n autograph,2008-10-28 14:50:00,2540,"K, i may sound a little slow.....but how fast is a knot?"
262593,bigugli,2008-10-28 14:54:00,6138,"A knot, or nautical mile, is not the same as a measured mile but is appx 10% greater than a land mile.  If travelling 30 knots the = roughly 33mph. On shipboard, speed was never expressed in knots beyond an estimate. Engine speed was gauged strictly by rpms."
262595,fishing n autograph,2008-10-28 14:56:00,2540,oh okay so it's pretty much the same as saying mph
262596,Marko,2008-10-28 14:56:00,854,1 knot is 1.85 kmh
262637,JohnF,2008-10-28 16:27:00,3494, How kwik are yer hands?  JF

262704,Governator,2008-10-28 18:45:00,879,Hoping the winds will die down for thursday... Planning to go then as temp warms.
262732,Terry,2008-10-28 20:00:00,14456,"the winds were strong  last Saturday on BOQ 37 km plus ,but Lloyds big  boat handled it nicely, we were safe and dry  if anyone wants to try BOQ walleye, I can think of a better guide to go with   http://www.stevemorissette.com/uandme/index.html"
262754,HTHM,2008-10-28 21:10:00,4082,I drove over the Grand at Caledonia today and there were WHITECAPS! on the river.
262811,fishindevil,2008-10-28 23:18:00,6254,"Man i can just imagine how rough the big lakes & places like the bay of quinte would be the day or two,and including today !!!! it would be a very rough rideto say the least,think of all the guys who booked holidays and drove tons of miles to be there this week. im glad im only an 1 1/2 away,i can do day trips if i have to,its supposed to get better in a few days,and things will be fishable again,as lots of fishermen ,myself included want a long fall before winter shows up,so we can get several more trips down to the bay before the boats go away for the big winter sleep !!!..lol..lol. hey G are you going to quinte this fall????"

262962,StrealHeader,2008-10-29 11:33:00,56,Please don't   here terry
262963,lew,2008-10-29 11:38:00,12767," Terry's not spamming, he's recommending a guide he's had a good experience with.  That's what we do here......."
263035,LeXXington,2008-10-29 16:16:00,1928,"  Yeap goes both ways too, bad service is also pointed out"
263049,jwl,2008-10-29 16:59:00,1056, that's classic man...someone with just over 60 posts commenting on something like that about someone with over 7000  so how's the weather shaping up again
263132,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 21:31:00,1780, That's the truth.
263202,StrealHeader,2008-10-30 00:26:00,56,"Had someone asked for recommendations for a guide and Terry had given his experience, then no it would not have been spamming. But bringing up a guide in a post about weather conditions is obviously spam, but i guess with a high enough post count it is tolerated.  Hopefully Rick will chime in."
