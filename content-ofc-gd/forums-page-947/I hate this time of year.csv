263001,Mike Pike,2008-10-29 13:38:00,1332,"I LOVE this time of year!  No more yard work so more time to fish.. which I do 12 months of the year down Niagara way!  Drifting for trout throughout the winter months keeps me so busy, there's hardly any time to icefish!!!"
263003,kemper,2008-10-29 13:43:00,2232,"There is only one time of the year better than late fall, and thats march!  The steelies are big, angry and hungry in march"
263043,LeXXington,2008-10-29 16:43:00,1928,Is it spring yet????
263198,limeyangler,2008-10-30 00:23:00,5204,i dont hunt....but i will fish all year....i'm gonna winterize my boat despite there being at least 3 weeks of softwater left...just dont wanna have to do it when its minus 20. Last year i was on the ice December 1st...COME ON ICE!!!!!!
263203,misfish,2008-10-30 00:27:00,29133,"Are buckets still in season????????????????????? Yes Im talking buckets. Terry you reading this??????????????????? , , , , , , , ,LOL"
263304,Greencoachdog,2008-10-30 12:23:00,8163, Everything is always in season down here!!!
262745,tinbanger,2008-10-28 20:34:00,1028,"Hunting posts , boat storage posts , steelhead posts , NF posts , hockey posts ...can mean only one thing ...soft water fishing is almost over.  I have 6 trips planned for the next 6 weeks and they will fly by .  December is the cruelest month  tb"
262747,misfish,2008-10-28 20:57:00,29133,"Suck it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The rest of us have too.LOL  Happy hunting ."
262753,bigugli,2008-10-28 21:09:00,6138,Fishing season never ends. Just get to save a lot of coin putting fish on ice.
262757,Wild,2008-10-28 21:18:00,704,Sounds like a GTG down to the southern states is in order to cure the winter time chills
262764,jwl,2008-10-28 21:27:00,1056,"I live 2 blocks from the Niagara River, and fish the steelies all winter long, and late winter lakers as well..there's always soft water fishing 12 months a year...my boat sees the water more in the winter than the summer"
262767,Mike the Pike,2008-10-28 21:36:00,3421,"You know you can fish the BOQ until December but a boat with windshield would be the better choice of vessels that time of year.And our Honda Odysseys not so good at the ramp in December where there is a wil there is a way.  What bothers me is how long it takes to get safe ice .I think we need to organize an Alabama G2G a little Nascar some fishing by the Dam ,maybe some ocean fishing hell we could even watch the Bozo's at GCD's favorite launch.  MTP"
262774,bigugli,2008-10-28 21:47:00,6138,I've been to Florida a few times to get some bass fishing down in Kissimee in January and February. Feels kinda strange to walk out of your hotel in the heart of Orlando and start catching bass and bream.  I think the City of Orlando had 30 stocked lakes in the city last time I checked. I've fished in Disney as well. What a hoot.  I could like that kind of G2G.
262775,tbayboy,2008-10-28 21:54:00,1497,"Oh man don't tell me that bigugli, I just bailed out of a family disney trip (7 days hanging out with my brothers bratty kids).  Now I've gotta rethink the whole thing!  Oh and to stay on topic, I agree - the next 2-3 months are painful, I have to admit that it's time to organize the lures that have been scattered into 100 different planos and clean the gear"
262776,Governator,2008-10-28 21:55:00,879,"Quick newbie question - What exactly does Soft Water Fishing mean?  Last time I checked, water is soft by nature"
262782,bigugli,2008-10-28 22:14:00,6138," You poor man. Early morning you walk out the hotel door and there is a stocked pond just stacked with C & R piggies. The grounds keepers become your private cheering section as you pound the banks. They have bass charters out of 3 different locations. They will provide everything. They even have a 2 hour kids session at Ft Wilderness. They also have pontoon boats to rent. I've fished at New Orleans, Ft. Wilderness, Pop Century and Disney downtown. On my last  trip down we took my mother along. She had never been to Disney. We booked a 1/2 day charter of spinnerbait and shinner fishing. What a hoot.  I went fishing every morning before breakfast. I go nowhere if there is no fishing!"
262783,tinbanger,2008-10-28 22:15:00,1028,governator you will soon see all that 'soft' water in the bay turn hard (ice) it just take so damn long
262784,Governator,2008-10-28 22:16:00,879,  Oh hahah gotcha   Thank you sir.
262791,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-28 22:33:00,1362,"I tend to love this time of year!!  ....no bugs to deal with....BOQ hawgs are startin to migrate in from Lake O, Muskies are starting their fall feeding frenzy....and last but not least...THE BEER STAYS COLD WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT ICE IN THE COOLER"
262799,chickenhawk,2008-10-28 22:46:00,612,"Come on there is always soft water somewhere....you just gotta know where to look! Anyways, good luck on the hardwater this season!   Hawk"
262810,Rich,2008-10-28 23:17:00,3927,"I agree, this time of year sucks! Bring on the ice!"
262813,solopaddler,2008-10-28 23:24:00,8605,"Every season has it own interest and excitement, (at least for me  )"
262817,Rizzo,2008-10-28 23:31:00,4754,"not so fast...I'm hoping there are still a muskie or 5 out there with my name on it. I'm fishing the next 2 days up GBay way, then after that its 2 or 3 trips on the upper niagara before the boat goes away"
262827,irishfield,2008-10-29 00:03:00,26272,Be safe Rizzo... big winds for the next couple of days on the bay!  Dave.... suck it up... There's some trips left on the bay yet fella! Water is still warm and boat's still ready... now just gotta find some/make some time! Got some new baits ready so gotta go hunting for the big gal...
262830,misfish,2008-10-29 00:05:00,29133, 
262862,Greencoachdog,2008-10-29 00:43:00,8163," Now there's a name you don't see to often on this board, Bream is what we Rednecks call all sunfish. It's even written into our fishing regulations meaning all Bluegill, Redear Sunfish, Pumpkinseeds, Green Sunfish, Rock Bass, Warmouth, and Fliers.  Our version of the Walleye/Pickeral thing."
262895,tinbanger,2008-10-29 01:38:00,1028,don't missunderstand ..i plan on sevral more outings its just that ..    THE END IS NEAR !  tb
262900,Rizzo,2008-10-29 01:43:00,4754," I'll be finding some smaller waters than the actual Bay itself (ie moon, magnetewan, etc) or some other offshoot."
262921,Moosebunk,2008-10-29 02:34:00,3970,Suckin' it up sucks!!!  I've been down and out for a month and likely have 4 more to go.  Enjoy your snowstorm tonight though... for those in the valley.
262924,rickster,2008-10-29 02:38:00,495,bring on the ice (after i get my deer of course)
262943,bigugli,2008-10-29 04:56:00,6138, Had a blast catching them in Florida. We were using little shrimp/ grass prawns? as bait.
