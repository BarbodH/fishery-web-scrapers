250970,mikeh,2008-09-18 20:58:00,824,"I have been down there a few times and fishing has been poor, lots of people still go there though."
263447,BigGuppy,2008-10-31 01:11:00,19,I take my son there to kill time pretty regularly. Tonnes of Gobies and Catfish. Nothing more than that though.
263644,Jet,2008-10-31 21:26:00,364,"I was there most of sept. but got nothing. Haven't been since. Then again the salmon ran late this year. I heard there is a creek west of the rouge that is much more productive. A few weeks ago some friends were there hanging out, not fishing, and said they were jumping consistantly."
