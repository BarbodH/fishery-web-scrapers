262824,GbayGiant,2008-10-28 23:56:00,1780,"Well last time out yesterday got a huge pike, and went out musky fishing again today and surprise- surprise another nice one but smaller than the last one, pike that is, can't get any musky, lol.  This one was on the other side of the bay not even close to where I got the one yesterday but same lure and same deal, it hit on a 15"" hump off a point rite when it started bouncing. I heard my real clicker start to scream and looked back and seen a nice fish fly totally out of the water 4 or 5 feet, so of course I thought to myself ""nice finally another musky"" started reeling it in and it jumped clear out of the water again, got it to the boat and its a damn Pike,   anyway not bad but it totaled the lucky Firetiger Jake and swallowed all the hooks so I had to cut them all out but she did swim away with no blood.  So much for that myth that Pike don't jump I guess.      I had no idea this Jake was wood, always thought they were plastic ? well off to the repair shop she goes.  "
262826,fishindevil,2008-10-29 00:03:00,6254,"Nice sized pike john !!!   great play by play report too,well hey maybe you should go pike fishing and maybe you will get your muskie !!!   at least you got 2 nice pike,and better luck next time with the ski hunting !!!...cheers"
262829,johnnyb,2008-10-29 00:04:00,3413,Very nice!  I love the shot of the Jake all torn to shreds
262836,DANIMAL,2008-10-29 00:11:00,215,"Nice pike. I dont think thats a jake, Ive disected them before and they are plastic. I think the grandma lures used to be wood and they look the same."
262845,irishfield,2008-10-29 00:17:00,26272,Great stuff John.. and quit putting the hook thru your line guides!
262847,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 00:22:00,1780,"I'm almost positive it's a Jake Dan but could be wrong, maybe Jake's use to be wood too ? I wish they were all wood still though could be they reason this one is working so good with a little different action. It's the exact same as my other Jake's in size and shape and my Grandmas have a different lip and a little smaller but could be a old style Grandma.    Yeah, that was just for the shot Wayne, I usually hook the top hook onto the reel so the hooks don't scratch the rod or bend the guides."
262890,pike slayer,2008-10-29 01:34:00,1177,"nice pike! i got a few lures that look like that to. pike do jump, not like a bass though. ive even had pike jump out of the water and on the way down grab my lure. on the weekend my buddy lost a nice 8-9pike cause it jumped and spit the hook."
262896,Rizzo,2008-10-29 01:39:00,4754,"wow, that's a beauty pike. At that size, I'd actually enjoy it rather than the usual ""dang pike"" reaction"
262898,Leecher,2008-10-29 01:42:00,7832,Great report and pics GbayGiant Another real nice pike... WTG  May be next time you'll get a ski Thanks for sharing Leechman
262911,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 02:14:00,1780,"Thanks boys.   Yeah I hear you Rizzo, they are still nice to get when there big but they are big enough to think you got a musky and then they get to the boat and it's not, but I can't complain they were fun to catch.  Think I'll have to go with the 14"" Jake's next time out, these 10""ers are to small for the muskies this year apparently."
262915,sharper,2008-10-29 02:27:00,279,Thats a monster pike good job! I'm surprised pike jump as well.
262916,Rizzo,2008-10-29 02:29:00,4754," man oh man where will it end! I've got a 36 inch novelty Rapala lure (in firetiger I might add), I think I'm going to try trolling it tomorrow. Tie it off to the transom and troll it for a few minutes in the prop wash!"
262917,Moosebunk,2008-10-29 02:30:00,3970,Don't go dissing the pike.  They're better fighters than them muskies.... Ahem (or so I'm told) lol.
262928,GbayGiant,2008-10-29 02:48:00,1780,"Ha, that would be a sight Rizzo, might be a little to big    but I have seen a pic of a guy that got one on a 22"" custom crankbait."
262959,chickenhawk,2008-10-29 11:18:00,612,nice lookin jack! nice job man thx for the report...    Hawk
263027,mattyk,2008-10-29 15:43:00,2110,nice looking pike!
