263371,John,2008-10-30 20:07:00,2956,I think that the typewriter on the table adds that little bit of olde world charm!
263375,misfish,2008-10-30 20:39:00,29133,"Animals on the wall Just because you won the largest trout at this year’s fishing competition, doesn’t mean it’s worthy of being hung on your living room wall. The same goes for moose heads, antlers, polar bear rugs, et cetera. They are tacky, and often end up frightening your guests, rather than impressing them. If you must see your trophy piece displayed on a wall, opt for a more modest room, such as the garage (or perhaps a dim corner in the basement.)   Spoken like a true p,,,e,,,,,, ah never mind,they aint worth it.LOL"

263426,bigugli,2008-10-31 00:05:00,6138,What a pile of panty waisted poofter dribble.  I like to see loads of outdoors mementos all through my house. Your home should be a representation of who you are. Animals and fish and rustic wood decor are just fine if they represent your lifestyle.

263438,Bernie,2008-10-31 00:33:00,3190,"When they start to say crap like this you know it isn't worth reading any further.  ""Even ceiling fans, though practical, should be avoided at all costs. ""  I hate when ""fashion"" comes ahead of practicality."
263441,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 00:45:00,8163,"  Yeah, form over function... I don't think so!"
263443,Bernie,2008-10-31 00:53:00,3190,Ummmm? Why were you looking at fashion/decorating anyway?   Can't say as I have ever looked for stuff like this.
