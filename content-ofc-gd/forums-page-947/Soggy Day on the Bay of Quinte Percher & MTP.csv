261782,Mike the Pike,2008-10-26 14:13:00,3421,"Just got up at 9am I was pretty tired from yesterday a long wet day almost everything I brought to Quinte was wet.  Last Monday I got the invite from Percher to go searching for the big eyes in the Bay of Quinte now how could I say no I was also looking forward to fishing in his new boat.We only fish together a couple of times per year since we both have our own boats.  We stayed at the Sportsmen Motel which I thought was a pretty good deal for the buck.Roomy clean and not too far from the launch in Picton.  Friday night Percher callled me on my cell and said we would need rain gear since we both didn't bring our gear of course.I stopped in Napanee to pick up 2 cheapie rain suits well one pancho and a suit for Percher what a mistake you will see why later.  We woke up to a soggy day we knew it was going to be a wet one.I went off to Timmies just after 6am and met up with Memart(Rob) we had a little chat I went back to the motel and well Rob told me he would be dry for the day because he had booked a charter with Lloyd in his roomy long Princecraft.  We Launched just after 7 and it looked like alot of folks decided to stay home due to the soggy day.Just before we left we put on the cheapie rain wear which ripped to itty bitty pieces in seconds  Dan and I had one messy episode at one point the whole boat spun around and what a mess 4 very tangled lines 2 off the riggers and 2 on the planer boards.The mess was so bad we had to go to shore and take off the line that had was wrapped aroung the prop on Perchers new kicker motor.After the biggest bird nest I had ever seen we got right back to it and headed for some new fishing grounds.  Now on with the pics.   After hours of trolling I finally caught this beat up old Walleye as you can clearly see she had many battle scars .I wish had done a better job holding her up folks but it was miserable out there just pouring rain all day and it never let up.I could barely see out of my glasses. I caught her flat lining it about 80 feet of water.She weighed 9 1/2 pounds.       I didn't take many shots yesterday because well it was always raining. This is a shot of Lloyds boat with Memart and Terry aboard the thought did cross my mind how dry they must be. Good to see you again Terry and Nice to have met Rob,John and Lloyd.When I arrived back on shore I was soaked to the gaunchy's but the day was worth it.Oh BTW Memart caught a nice eye hopefully he can post a pic of her.   Now as you can see Dan has gained some weight his Superman suit exploded trying to light that wet lighter     Thats a better shot of Captain Percher.   Now go figure its time to drive back to Montreal and the Sun comes out  It was short lived because it poured rain all the way home.      Well thanks for the Great day Dan always a pleasure fishing with you and thanks for putting me on a nice fish now if I could only catch fish in my boat.  I am looking forward to November.  Mike the Pike"

Good on Dan for putting you on that fish!  When fish are that old and the water is that cold, you don't have to beat them into submission with a machete Mike!  Just kiddin' ya Bubba!  Great report, pics, and fish!!!  Way to tough it out in miserable weather!!! You're lots tougher than me when it comes to cold weather!"

262126,Greencoachdog,2008-10-27 04:19:00,8163,"I think yer gettin' a nibble Jed...   Mike, consider the following:  1. He's an ignorant hick turned arrogant billionaire...  2.If you post a lot of words with a report, some folks may feel inclined to pick it apart... we're just here for the pics Bubba...  3. Internet sticks and stones don't pack near the punch as real life sticks and stones...  4. At least he didn't bash you post count!"
262150,Bly,2008-10-27 11:33:00,1556,"Mike and Dan,  Walleye might be a beat up one but still a nice one!   Thanks for the pictures and report guys, going to miss seeing you at Quinte this year, hope you land a few monsters!"
