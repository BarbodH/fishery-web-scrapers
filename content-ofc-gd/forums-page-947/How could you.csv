263440,Wild,2008-10-31 00:45:00,704,"In September alone there were over 81,000 forclosures and evictions in the US. Some have no choice"
263453,mbac31,2008-10-31 01:27:00,904,"There is always a choice. Wether or not you decide to make the right one or not is up to the animals owner. Let a friend or neighbor or someone take care of them until they get back on their feet.  I have a dog that was a shelter dog and will probally get another. 3 dogs right now and love them like family. One guy beat this poor beagle an killed his mother in a field. Took this dog 2 years to get to trust me.  They go fishing, hunting, cottage, long drives to Newfoundland each year, etc . I just have to say boat or truck and they  are at the door in seconds. I vaccum the hair each weekend out of my truck. They shed, big deal. We  will be having a baby in Feburary and will raise  my children with them. Sorry but this world has become a throw away society.  Same as children. Raise them properly and they will be ok. Dogs are a reflection of their owners.  My 2 cents"

263520,wgk36,2008-10-31 11:37:00,69,"That was hard to read.  My Golden Retriever got out Tuesday morning without his collar (first time in 8 years).  We spent hours driving around town looking for him.  At 8:30 pm, we got a call from the SPCA.  Someone had found him. He was safe.  Those hours were long and hard for me.  It was like loosing my best friend.  I dread the day when he is old and gray, and the right (humane) discission is to lay him down.  I can't imagine ""discarding"" him before it is absolutely necessary.  Having a dog is a life long comitment (his, not yours)."
263526,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 11:48:00,8163, Like I said... it's very sad.
