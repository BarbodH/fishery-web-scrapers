My brother accepted his 3rd professional MMA fight in Calgary on October 25th, so we made plans to attend.  My girlfriend, Kelli and I decided to extend our vacation afterwards and go to Banff for a couple days.  After planning this vacation, our roommate Cal decided to make a move to Banff for a few months, so he came with us.  Our first day, we flew into Calgary, helped Mike cut weight before weigh-ins and attended the weigh-ins.  Nothing exciting.  Fight Night.  The next night, we attended the fights.  You can read the report here if you desire .... RAW COMBAT RESULTS  The next morning, we got up early and headed to Banff...   Our first view of the mountains coming up   We finally entered the mountains and stopped for some photo ops      When we arrived in Banff, we dropped Cal off with his step-brother, said our goodbyes and we were off on our own.  Our first stop, the Banff Gondola      The Gondola costs $26 each and is worth every penny.  It is about a 10 minute ride up to the top of Sulphur Mountain, with amazing views and a skywalk located between two peaks, there are breathtaking views of Banff from up there.  But beware, it was a chilly -10C compared to the actual city's temp of 1C              When we got to our hotel, there was a deer laying under a tree, no fear at all.      The next morning, we went to the Banff Hot Springs ... gorgeous views, hot water, awesome to check out.       Banff Springs Hotel .... amazing!   Saying my goodbyes to the mountains, wish I had more time!"

262399,bpsbassman,2008-10-28 01:39:00,941,Great report Steve! Brings back some great memories. Had a buddy that got married at the top of Sulphur Mountain........ hint hint   :lol:
262408,outdoorguy61,2008-10-28 01:49:00,220,"Note- The area behind photo number 3 has a number of interesting fishing opportunities. It is a neat summer destination, with some big brown trout lurking at night. Just upstream, there is a series of backwaters that also provide an interesting fishery, as they remain generally ice free in the winter time and can provide a neat escape. Just passing this along ..... I lived for a number of years in Calgary and really enjoyed fishing this area.  outdoorguy61"
262420,Leecher,2008-10-28 02:14:00,7832,Breath taking pics Steve Thanks for sharing Leechman
262441,Joey,2008-10-28 02:49:00,9122,"Thanks Steve, that brought back some memories from when I lived in Calgary.  Used to drive down that highway every weekend to fish in the foothills and mountains.  The skiing is fantastic also.  You know how breathtaking the sight from the top of Sulphur Mountain is now, so imagine skiing down a mountian similar to that.  Takes awhile to get down and the scenery is awesome the whole time.  Thanks for sharing.  Joey"
