262443,silvio,2008-10-28 02:53:00,433,I always wanted to take it up as a kid but my mom wouldn't let me just yet now she has faced it its not a faze just something I always loved and is no longer holding my back. I plan to do the course over Christmas or march break if there offering it.
262450,Leecher,2008-10-28 03:08:00,7832, With that positive attitude you will succeed.  Been hunting since I'm 12 years old and just can't get enough of it My first few years weren't all that good but with time gain lot's more experience and a good friend of mine showed me how to become a better hunter.   So far in 31 years of hunting only were able to successfully shoot 5 deers.  Three of the racks are hung up on the wall and everyday looking at them remember each and every moment.  Best of luck to you

262892,Leecher,2008-10-29 01:35:00,7832," Thanks smokey Just receive an email from him and the story is that the deer, when he saw it was on the move and had to bark/yell 3 times in order for the deer to stop before him @40 yards,  black powder, you only get one shot and got him through the lungs and drop right in it's tracks.  He also says to thank everyone for the kind comments Leechman"
