263413,Bernie,2008-10-30 22:42:00,3190,Haven't got mine yet Brian. But it takes a while to get it here by dogsled.
263463,bucktail,2008-10-31 01:41:00,1857,Got it but havnt read it yet Brian. 4 times out havnt seen %^ this year. Will be out in the morning to continue pounding my head into my tree stand!
263485,douG,2008-10-31 02:35:00,2693,"Brian, that issue you are talking about arrived the day I got back from slaying steelhead with solopaddler and ccmt.  I read the steel article and thought, 'True, true, and true again, but there is still a little more to it,'.  I think that solopaddler should be writing those articles.  Better pictures for sure.  The stories he tells aren't true, but they are entertaining."
263521,Greencoachdog,2008-10-31 11:39:00,8163,Even Elmer Fudd doesn't use a feeder...
263573,bassjnkie,2008-10-31 15:28:00,1101," Just saw the post. The feeder is easy and cheap to make. I made one and put it in the field this yesterday morning, will check it out later today."
