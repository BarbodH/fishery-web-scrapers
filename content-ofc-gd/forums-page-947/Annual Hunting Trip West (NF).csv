263050,Billy Bob,2008-10-29 17:01:00,5865,"Great, NO EXCELLENT report. I always LOVE the pictures you guys post here. This has to be the #1 report IMHO ! ! !  Now about that .300 Savage. That gun is a Savage Model 99 lever action that is probably worth some nice coin if you didn't know already. I have one in a .243 Win that is in MINT condition. Depending on the condition of that model 99 and it's serial number it could even be a collectors item. Here is a site that can answer all that. Not many guns have there own sites but the Savage Model 99 is a really sought after firearm from the past.  http://www.24hourcampfire.com/ubbthreads/u...Board/40/page/1"
263152,Moosebunk,2008-10-29 22:13:00,3970,Enjoyed that very much TJ.  Thanks.  Good luck with a buck next year.

263417,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-10-30 23:05:00,0,"Great hunt TJ    Love the pitctures and smiling faces, and most important the comeraderie this goes with one of our oldest heritages, I fought fires near Fort Frances in an area buy Cuttle lake if thats familial back in 1979 80 regarding the blood and gore it just looks like your average day in the Jane and Finch area"

Congrats to Nicholas and to his dad and the group for passing on the hunting heritage.  Already having trouble waiting for the weekend to get together with my hunting group, you just made it alot worse.  I guess I can just look at some more satellite maps of my area again.  Thanks for sharing and enjoy the memories and fine eating ahead."

262761,bigugli,2008-10-28 21:25:00,6138,"The pics in the cutting room sure do bring back memories of the Soo TJ. There would be 5-6 of us carving, cutting and blending and stuffing 200lb. lbs of sausage. All done  while washing down a couple of gallons of homemade wine. Me being the new member of the party got to dig in and mix the sausage blend by hand. Right up to my elbows. Had to blend in a little bit of pork so the sausage didn't get too dry. Half would go in the freezer, the other half packed in oil to become cured dry sausage."
262763,solopaddler,2008-10-28 21:27:00,8605,"It's always the rookie who scores isn't it? LOL! Looks like a fantastic trip T.J., traditions are important."
