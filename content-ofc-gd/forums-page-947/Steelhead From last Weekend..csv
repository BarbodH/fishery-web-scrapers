263005,dobee,2008-10-29 14:24:00,301,Hit a couple tribs last weekend before the forcasted rain. Didn’t see a lot of people out but I didn’t see a lot of fish either. Cant wait to get out next weekend.  Enjoy.      fish on! dobee
263006,jwl,2008-10-29 14:27:00,1056,"nice fish Dobee..it only gets better from here, bring on the cold"
263042,Leecher,2008-10-29 16:36:00,7832,Great report and pics dobee Cool shot of the smaller one in your hand Thanks for sharing Leechman
263044,jdmls,2008-10-29 16:44:00,575,"Ya I did the same last saturday and only managed a couple ... The mud kicked in at about 11AM , but conditions were good before that ... Fishing the rise is tough, no to mention your usually in the middle of downpour on the rise which makes for an even more unpleasant experience."
263139,chickenhawk,2008-10-29 21:52:00,612,nice fish....nice fresh fish that hen is in the second picture...  Hawk

263173,ccmtcanada,2008-10-29 23:47:00,7971,Nice going Dobee!!  Gotta love the feel of steel on the end of your line.  Great job!
263185,kemper,2008-10-30 00:05:00,2232,and two different set ups to boot!  that is an addicted steelheader!  good fishin
263246,Doctrt,2008-10-30 03:02:00,141,Pretty sure that small one is a juvenile atlantic. Looks like a brown but the spots are redder and the tail is forked.  Looks a lot like this one I caught this spring on the headwaters of a local trib:    T
263247,silvio,2008-10-30 03:08:00,433,Dobee=brown doctrt= atlantic
263248,Doctrt,2008-10-30 03:10:00,141,"Looking again at the spotting patterns, I have to agree with Silvio as Dobee's does look like a brown (can't see the tail but I'm guessing it's squared).  Anyone getting any mature Atlantics?"
263261,limeyangler,2008-10-30 03:48:00,5204,"stop!!!!! i cant take it anymore....lol...NOOOOOOOO FAIR....we dont get those up here...and i wanna play too!!!!!   Awesome fish, do you float fish for those?...if you say yes...'m even more jealous.  Great report....go get 'em."
263286,dobee,2008-10-30 11:01:00,301,"thanks guys. that is a brown, it had a squared tail.  the 2nd pic doesnt do it justice, i had the camera on the wrong setting and it tooked crap pictures. all pixalated and stuff.. it was very fresh,  tight lines..  and yes i float fish for steelhead. but i do bring a casting rod for kwikfish and spoons just incase.."
263294,solopaddler,2008-10-30 11:44:00,8605,"Well done bud! If you're fishing this weekend it should be absolutely prime, good luck!"
