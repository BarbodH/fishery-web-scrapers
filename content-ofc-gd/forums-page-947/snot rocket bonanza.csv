The weather was just awesome, compared to the last week or so. It was still about minus 2, but the sun was out, skies blue, and no wind. maybe not the best for our target species walleye, but just too nice a day to pass up on the chance of fishing    STARTED CATCHING NORTHERNS STRAIGHT OFF THE BAT             AND CATCHING            AND CATCHING            AND CATCHING           AND CATCHING            THEY WERE LITTERALLY FLYING INTO TE BOAT....A 3 HOUR SNOT ROCKET FEST           AS THE SUN STARTED TO SET WE HAD BEEN FISHING FOR THREE HOURS, MOVED AROUND A BIT, CHANGED DEPTHS/STRUCTURE ETC....BUT NO WALLEYE           THEN AS THE SUN DIPPED BEHIND THE HORIZON...IT WENT COMPLETELY DEAD           WHAT A GORGEOUS EVENING ON THE LAKE THOUGH         JUST AS WE WERE GONNA CALL IT A DAY...THE WALLEYE BITE STARTED....AND ENDED 15 MINUTES LATER...BUT WE GOT SUPPER.  "

263219,Leecher,2008-10-30 01:12:00,7832,Great report and pics limeyangler  Lots of fun when the bite is on     Cool shot of the flying pike Thanks for sharing Leechman
263226,Greencoachdog,2008-10-30 01:22:00,8163,"Beautiful report LA!!!  There's nothing wrong with catching Poike!!!... Fish with big teeth and an attitude!!!  ... man I love that stuff!!!  When I go fishin', I fish for what is biting!  Good show on catchin' the Wall-ice when they were biting!... but you ought to know they're gonna bite best during the low light hours!  You've really got those fish of the GWN dialed in Bubba!     btw... do you ever eat any of those Pike?... they really are decent table fare!!!"
263252,jediangler,2008-10-30 03:32:00,1923,Great report and pics. Showing some patience payed off after all. Enjoy your meal.
263256,GbayGiant,2008-10-30 03:40:00,1780,"Happens all the time on those sunny no wind days, fish all day for walleye not a thing, than the sun dips down and you get 4 or 5 in 15 min.  Nice rocket fest."
263257,limeyangler,2008-10-30 03:42:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies guys. GCD...me and dave are among the few folk up this way that dont mind catching pike....they are not the most popular species up here at all, but i love 'em....fight hard and are always hungry...perfect fish if you ask me....and yup...i eat them...i actually prefer it to walleye...but if i said that out loud up here i would be shot at dawn...if not soooner!"
263262,Wild,2008-10-30 03:49:00,704,Nothing wrong with pike! cut into strips and boil them up and you have a tasty shrimp like alternative.
263279,bigugli,2008-10-30 08:45:00,6138,"Filleted, they're almost as tasty as walleye. I've got the 4 fillet method down pat.  The pike has to have some meat on its bones though. Gotta be 22"" or better They also are a favourite ingredient in my Gram's ""fish head soup"".  I can still remember her or my aunt, in  their heavy Finnish accent, with the weekly reminder.  "" You bring home pike for soup!"", and my great aunt giving my cousin royal heck because I brought home pike and he did'nt. Of course, Gram would reward me for being a good grandson and give me beer money for next weekend. The old girls were always giving each other the gears about who had the better grandson. Tyyne was always proud of her Finn boy.  Yup I was spoiled rotten."
263287,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-30 11:03:00,3761,"I wish i could catch pike like that, sorry you didn't get as many walleye as you wanted. Great Report!"
263367,GbayGiant,2008-10-30 19:45:00,1780,"I agree they taste the exact same as Walleye in the 20-25"" range, than they can get real fatty and oily."
263411,jwl,2008-10-30 22:36:00,1056,"right on, nothin wrong with that, it's great when you can get into a bunch of hungry pike on a frenzy..you never know when the next one is going to be a 3 footer"
263422,mattyk,2008-10-30 23:40:00,2110,"thanks for the report, some nice pics."
