263213,Wild,2008-10-30 00:51:00,704,"3D View GPS for above and below the water and it's a road unit as well !Garmin has an interesting unit coming out in 2009 and I am thinking about pulling the trigger on this one if it gives me an edge on defining structure. Technology is making GPS more interesting all the time.  Garmin GPS Map 620  New sonar is also on the  shopping list, while I have had Eagle products in the past Humminbird sidescan technology has my interest  Humminbird 1197 Sidescan Sonar  Thoughts on pros and cons?"
263240,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-30 02:23:00,835,I got an interphase pc view last fall that scans and hooks up to a laptop. my biggest problem was not having time to learn how to use it. It took a while to get it up and running due to conflicts with the gps and touchscreen but the guys at interphase got me sorted out. I haven't fished deeper than 18 feet since I  got it working so I haven't had a chance to see what it can really do. I'm hoping to take a run to BOQ and try it there before I pickle the boat.
263250,GbayGiant,2008-10-30 03:21:00,1780,"I got the Garmin Blue Vision chip in mine and I don't use the 3D at all just keep it on the regular setting, basically use it to find the general area and then it's the depth finder that I look at because it will be more accurate then the 3D view, the 3D view will follow the gps contours witch as you know are somewhat off compared to whats really under the water, the depth finder is 100% accurate. It's cool to look at, that's about all though, haven't tried the side views yet."
263254,Greencoachdog,2008-10-30 03:36:00,8163,"I'm not sure if the Humminbird technology is for you... it's built by Rednecks (here in Alabama) for Rednecks!!!  All I've ever owned is Humminbird products and they serve me well!  ... and in reality, all the major are good products!... It's just whatever you get used to."
263266,Wild,2008-10-30 04:07:00,704,I am going to look at the interphase sounds interesting Polliwogg can it record video onto the drive for reviewing later on?  What unit do you have John? Reading up about the sidescan technology and looking at the submissions it can define all types of structures rather well plus a wide area can be looked at in far less time.  OK OK Dawg you can come up and operate it next summer as we search for those monster trophies!
263274,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-30 05:22:00,835,I haven't used the interphase  much yet but I think it will record the screen. I thought I'd use it on LO but didn't get out this year.

263347,Billy Bob,2008-10-30 17:32:00,5865,"The Humminbird Sidescan technology really has something over Lowrance. It's transom mount sidescan transducer that they got a patent on is what separates Hummingbird from ALL other 2D sonar units.  If Lowrance could get around that patent you could bet your last nightcrawler they would have a sidescan unit on the market. You have to take a look at this post all the way down until you see member ""Doug Vahrenberg"" post the pictures from his sidescan unit. This is UNBELIEVABLE pictures to use while you are on the water and I'm a FULL TIME Lowrance guy.........  CHECK THIS OUT....... http://bbcboards.zeroforum.com/zerothread/...-final-decision"
263437,Wild,2008-10-31 00:33:00,704,"That's what I am talking about Bob this technology will prove very useful on uncharted or poorly charted lakes and rivers, you can see how fast structure can be found and detailed. I can't wait to try it out."
