197577,silveradosheriff,2008-05-06 19:52:00,1025,"Hit the big water with Iceguy this morning. It was a lovely morning to try and find some Salmon.  Fishing was slow, with only this wanna-be teenager cooperating. Taken off the rigger 40/80.  Neither the dipsey nor the core moved an inch.  :-)  "
197581,Reef Runner,2008-05-06 19:54:00,981,Good day anyway.  Beats sitting infront of the 'ol 'puter.  Thanks for sharing.  reefrunner
197585,Smokey,2008-05-06 19:59:00,1278,Nice fish and better then nothing. What part of the lake where you fishing?  Thanks for the report.  Mike
197590,silveradosheriff,2008-05-06 20:07:00,1025," Launced out of Dalhousie, fish was taken heading towards the Welland Canal."
197678,iceguy,2008-05-06 23:22:00,341,Better than being at work.. athough the reason I skipped work was to get my king fix which I didn't get.:-(
197700,silveradosheriff,2008-05-07 00:00:00,1025,"I think it was that darn rusty Torpedo diver - spooking the Kings! I am not about to sell the riggers...repeat, not selling the riggers!!!"
197723,irishfield,2008-05-07 00:33:00,26272, LOL... kinda what I figured !  You got out.. that's the main thing. It was great day to be on the water... we flogged GBay for 8 hours today too.
197751,silveradosheriff,2008-05-07 01:30:00,1025,"Ran the Torpedo off the church board - pulled pretty hard (Musky Torpedo) due to the weight of the diver (9.5oz), not the resistance. They will get a spot in the rotation as I will use them as an alternative to the core and the copper off the boards, maybe down the chute as well."
197781,live2fish,2008-05-07 02:08:00,70,we went 3 for 4 tnoight off weller. Do i need to get you guys back ont the reelhard and show you what catches fish?
197859,iceguy,2008-05-07 10:45:00,341,Anysize Bowen? What did you catch the fish on Reelhard.net ?
197901,silveradosheriff,2008-05-07 12:38:00,1025,Good work Bowen! All Rob kept talking about was your troll master....and beads.
198355,live2fish,2008-05-08 01:50:00,70,beads took most fish. one was near 20 but not quite other 2 were teens and one that was an inch bigger than the spoon. Shallower than before 30-40 zone spoons riggers.
198359,iceguy,2008-05-08 01:58:00,341,We tried near where we were for the scotty. Rans spoons in same spots just couldn't hook up. We ran the rusty beads all morning.
198402,Sinker,2008-05-08 02:51:00,8692,"I have to ask what your talking about when you mention beads? Is this some new rigging, or is it just a nickname for something else? Never heard of that before......I don't do any great lakes trolling either.....just from charter boats.  If its a secret, I won't tell anyone, I promise  Sinker"
198495,silveradosheriff,2008-05-08 12:09:00,1025, Just spit coffee all over my keyboard - that is damn funny!     It's a bit of a joke as one day I was busy spilling the beads used for the slide diver all over the boat...the dialogue deteriorated from there....
