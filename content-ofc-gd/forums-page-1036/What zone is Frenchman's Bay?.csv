198496,Yellow14,2008-05-08 12:09:00,29,"Just want to make sure I have the right zone. From the regs I am lead to believe that Frenchman's Bay is zone 20, which would put the pike in season.  It would be bad if I hauled in a pike only to find out that it is in fact part of zone 17. Otherwise I guess I will just fish for panfish."
198513,ccmtcanada,2008-05-08 12:31:00,7971,"If you look in the zone exceptions, you'll see Frenchman's Bay listed as zone 20.  The exception is noted for using 2 lines, but the inclusion in the list tells me it's zone 20.  All waters of Zone 20, including the Niagara River (downstream of Niagara Falls). The following waters are excluded: Jordan Harbour, Hamilton Harbour, Toronto Harbour, Frenchman's Bay, Murray Canal, Presqu'ile Bay, Weller's Bay, East Lake, West Lake, the Bay of Quinte (the waters lying west of the Glenora Ferry), the St. Lawrence River (waters lying east of Bishops Point and the easternmost tips of Howe and Wolfe islands), and all other tributaries to Lake Ontario."
