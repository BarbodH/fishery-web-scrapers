198178,Roy,2008-05-07 22:00:00,13728,"Might it be because you changed your ""personal photo"" and not your avatar??"
198180,Meely,2008-05-07 22:07:00,282,oops  and where might one find the Avatar pic re-setting feature thinga ma bob?  thanks Roy.  Meely
198185,Roy,2008-05-07 22:13:00,13728,"Emelio, at the top of the page, go to ""my Controls"". Scroll down the left side of the page you'll see ""personal profile"". Click on ""Edit avatar settings"" and select the pic you want from there.  Hope this helps.  The other way would be to send me the pic you want in there and I'll add it to where it belongs."
198188,Meely,2008-05-07 22:17:00,282,Thanks Roy. I think we got it ! Jeeze we got a good bunch on here.   Meely
