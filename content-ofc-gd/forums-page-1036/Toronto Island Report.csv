198167,frozen-fire,2008-05-07 21:45:00,542,"thanks guys... and yes, the females always outfish the males for some odd reason!  it's so hard to satisfy the crowd here.  I've posted before without blurred images and got some pms asking me to blur them. I blur them this time and people get annoyed of the blurring.  i didn't blur the carp pic cause it didn't reveal any shoreline structure. i know you can recognize the vegetation though.  next time i'm just gonna say what i caught and not post any pics.  hope to bump into some of you guys!"
198172,frozen-fire,2008-05-07 21:51:00,542,"and no, i don't have any secret spots. i think it's fair to say that the toronto islands is pretty heavily fished. there are so many people that fish it, it's ridiculous. But hey... the fishing still produces. When we got off hanlans, there were already 3 people fishing as we arrived,  half an hour later, another fishermen from hanlan's passes us. towards the end of the day, we see another group of fishermen all targetting pike."
198179,007,2008-05-07 22:05:00,537,"Nice pike and carp. When fishing the Islands, I have to say I always ended up catching the small jack pike like your holding, not the beauty that your girlfriend is holding.   I miss fishing the Islands - Always good fishing to be had once you find the spots and escape the crowds.  Hey dsn - you should know by now the carp are always stacked in that place at this time of year and even more so once the lillies start to come up!  007"
198191,ccmtcanada,2008-05-07 22:22:00,7971,Great to see you are leaving where you left off last year catching great pike on the Islands!!!  Congrats on a great day of fishing...both to you and your girlfriend.
197832,frozen-fire,2008-05-07 05:25:00,542,"Sorry for those who oppose blurred images. I don't want to upset anyone.  We decided to hit the islands for some pike. Skipped opening weekend cause of the weather, but today wasn't so good either. Chilly, overcast, and on/off showers. First fish was my gf's. She had a solid hit and was really excited. It then came off a few seconds later. She reeled in her line to show me that her leader was all twisted up. I knew that the pike had overshot, and took the line instead of the lure. I told her to throw it back in the direction where she got the hit. She didn't really believe me that it would strike again, but what do you know. The pike comes up and inhales the lure! Nice healthy fish.   The next fish was accidental. I thought I had a pike of a lifetime!!!!! Solid fight.... but it turned out to be a foul hooked carp. It was snagged on the dorsal fin. I brought it in to remove the lure, but decided to take a pic of it too. Pretty big one!   I then finally get lucky when I switch up the xrap for a jointed rapala. Small little guy, but fun nonetheless. It completely cleared the water twice. I was surprised it had so much energy considering the water is still pretty cold.   We bumped into other fishermen later into the day and they had some good success. They are also member on this forum too! They told us that there are police boats cruising the islands looking for fishermen and asking for licenses. Don't forget your licenses people. They are charging those fishing without them."
197834,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-07 05:33:00,435,I love the blurred images lol but I can still tell exactly where you were...doh  a little more blurr next time....right DSN lol  Nice clean looking fish though! Your GF's fish is a beaut!  Gotta Love that Urban Pikin'!  -Ben
197835,dsn,2008-05-07 05:35:00,1018,"Nice fish. I guess you were there the same day as me. But I was fishing the other end of the island. Yep I know where you were fishing.  I see you found the carp that I was looking for. Only a carp can give you a fight of a life time.  All the carpers know that, that's why they are carper's in the first place. Now I know where to find the carp now.  Thanks for info.    dsn"
197836,dsn,2008-05-07 05:41:00,1018," You got that right Ben !! And where you blurr also tells where you were !!! ahhh ha ha ha Look at this pic behind her. I see grass and that blur beside the grass, just under her hand tells me that its a cement wall. ha ha ha And we know where that wall is.  If you're going cover up, cover it all up!  DSN"
197837,frozen-fire,2008-05-07 05:47:00,542,"the carp are in there THICK. i had to get out of there cause i was afraid to foul hook more of them. we should all forget about pike and go for the carp!!! next time i'm bringing a can of corn hahaha.  if you guys can recognize those areas even with the blurring, then you're regulars who know the area well... like me haha. hopefully i can bump into one of you guys one day. might head down thursday."
197838,frozen-fire,2008-05-07 05:49:00,542,actually... it's NOT a cement wall at all hahahahaha we don't fish that cement wall often. you need to go more often!
197841,dsn,2008-05-07 05:56:00,1018,"  OH man, we ""LOVE Blurred pic bro."" The only thing we can't reconize is water yet. However I do know the color of the water in some areas. Example Black bottom, Green , and brown. DSN  I guess I should get out there with MJL with our heavy gear (buzzers and ground bait)"
197843,dsn,2008-05-07 05:59:00,1018, OOOOH ouch!!!  DSN
197844,mikeymikey,2008-05-07 06:23:00,376,"dsn, you can decrypt blurred images"

197882,BillM,2008-05-07 12:11:00,17367,"The blurred background pics are killing me!  This is Toronto Island, there is a very good chance that your 'secert' spot has been fished a million times by other people then yourself..."
197885,fatherof3,2008-05-07 12:17:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats to you and your girlfriend"
197926,MJL,2008-05-07 13:32:00,2427,Great report.  Nice fish too.  Top angling to your girlfriend.  She smoked you     (j/k)
197932,darsky,2008-05-07 13:41:00,586,why not blur out the carp location?
197937,RangerGuy,2008-05-07 13:56:00,564,You guys and your bluring pictures IT'S TORONTO! There's no secret spots LOL! WHAT A JOKE!
197956,tbayboy,2008-05-07 14:45:00,1497,"Thats a beauty your GF got, can't wait to hit the islands myself."

197960,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-07 14:59:00,241,I think I'm going to finally hit the island tomorrow. Can't wait. Nice fish dude!
197972,Reef Runner,2008-05-07 15:19:00,981,"Nice fish.  I went piking yesterday evening afterwork and got skunked.  I've noticed that most of these pike are caught during ""happy hour,"" ie. 11am.  Is that the case with your GF's pike?  I am just wondering if I'm wasting my time fishing late evenings because after 3-4 outings the skunk will never leave."
197973,CLofchik,2008-05-07 15:23:00,854, NP!  
197975,Carp,2008-05-07 15:27:00,1488,Excellent day for you. Congrats on the beauty fish.
