198622,irishfield,2008-05-08 14:33:00,26272,"I have no plans to make any fishinggeek.. they have to come up a 1200 foot laneway.. break into a hangar.. figure out how the 50 foot door opens.. and move three airplanes to get to my boat. When airplanes are gone back to customers..my boat is gone to the lake and trailer is in a locked trailer yard and insured for it's $3900 replacement. For other spots it's locked to my hitch... that can of course be easily defeated and a 5/8"" thick cable lock is thru one pair of wheels and around the  frame.  The thieves that eyeball them in laneways come prepared. Hydraulic cutters for the cable locks, etc and why I suggested the out of sight thru shaft. They'll get the hitch ball open and hook on and go.. but not far.  Pretty sure it was Terry that had the steel rod trick thru his wheels and his had been dragged a few feet in ""god's country"" before the thiefs fled."
198663,Headhunter,2008-05-08 15:19:00,5703,"My partner here at work has a cottage in the Kawartha's and has been broken into 3 times in the last 5 years! OPP state quite openly that it's ""just maw and paw Kettle out doing there grocery shopping"" get a security system... which they did. Now, when they get broken into, they find out right away, versus finding out when they arrive at their cottage for the weekend. The thieves stole all of their food, including what was in the freezer as well as some electronics... actually, anthing they could carry. A thief is the lowest form in my opinion. Garry... I have been talking to my wife for years about the exact same thing... but she's a city girl and I have my hands full with that one! HH"
198668,irishfield,2008-05-08 15:23:00,26272, You don't say...
198707,fishinggeek,2008-05-08 16:18:00,325," The Clamp looks cool, but with a price tag of $200 + taxes, shipping, and more if you want the wheel hub guard, that's a lot of money.  Personally, since I'm getting a new boat, I'm going to go with simple cable locks."
198553,Garry2Rs,2008-05-08 13:35:00,1425,"I get the weekly paper.  Because there isn't much to write about, they list the OPP calls. Most of the investigations are as Lew suggests, cottage break- ins.  These are mostly kids looking for booze...It's 9 O'clock, Do you know where your kids are?  Snow mobiles, boats and trailers occasionally go missing. I'll bet they're being stolen by city folk... No friends Crime may not stop at the city limits, but the farther from the Welfare Projects and the bus route you get the less there is. Things will be better when we built that wall across the 400 series highways! Up here, if a kid comes home with a snow machine, he will have to explain where it came from. If I come home with a new machine, I can expect a couple of people around town to comment, ""I see you got a new Skiddo."" It's one of those things about small communities. The attack in the woods story sounds more like Deliverance or Friday the 13th than real life to me, but I guess anything can happen. In my weekly paper this morning, there are no drive-by shootings, no murders, no stabbings, no dead hookers, no random violence, no home invasions, no Rice Rocket street racing, no Asian, Jamaican, or any other ethnic gangs, no gangs of any kind actually, no drug over doses, no homeless people or welfare mother dude stories and no Shots-fired police reports...What's in your paper?"
198567,bigfish1965,2008-05-08 13:44:00,3382,"I just insure everything to the maximum. Seems to take the sport out of it for the thieves. Last week I had my fence redone to include a gate at the end of the driveway. Now, I can simply move the boat into the backyard behind the wood fence where it cannot be seen and the gates open out so they'd have to steal the van (oh..that would so NOT break my heart) in order to get the gates open."
