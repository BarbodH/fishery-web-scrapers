197434,Bob Devine,2008-05-06 14:14:00,251,"Well I got the chance to take the guys who were the winning bidders on Tylers auction out yesterday. What a perfect Cinco de Mayo day it was, light winds and sunshine! Our first drift down the river Beaner boats 2 walleye. We continued to catch fish thoughout the day with a number of smallies, silver bass, sheephead and yellow perch to mix it up. We came back to the ramp with 12 good walleyes around 2-3 lbs. We had a great time telling jokes and having laughs, the guys were talking about having a few cold ones and frying some fish later in the day. I want to thank them and all those who stepped to the plate and helped Tyler and his family.  This includes those who did not win the items that they were bidding on.  Thanks again Dwayne, Jay and Beaner I enjoyed my time. "

197887,cthewrld,2008-05-07 12:22:00,99,Fishing with Bob is a great time.  I was out with him last week .... froze our butts off ......... caught more smallmouth than walleye ........ but still had a great time!  I hope to go out again when the weather is a little warmer!

198547,cthewrld,2008-05-08 13:23:00,99,"The luck of the draw.  A week earlier when I was out with Bob we had about 4 layers of clothes on as well as gloves and hats.  The wind was howling, and the walleye weren't biting.  Should have waited a week!"
