198385,ryan,2008-05-08 02:34:00,19,Just wondering if now is a good time to go after catfish or it is better to wait for warmer weather a bit later in the season. A buddy knows of a spot on the Trent river. Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks

While they are slower to take the bait they still will be happy to cooperate at those temps. As it get warmer they tend to leave deep water and move to their summer haunts like current breaks, points or areas were food is easily ambushed. I haven't fished for bullheads much usually we view them as bait stealing !%@$#$ some people have found them to be quite delicious  however I think they eat them because they haven't had a channel cat yet..... bullheads are just to ugly to taste any good.
