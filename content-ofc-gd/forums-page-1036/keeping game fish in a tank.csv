198839,e-z-out,2008-05-08 22:28:00,1052,  Thats what you feed them
198842,MuddyWater,2008-05-08 22:37:00,218,ive kept some small gamefish here and their bass are really cool but they eat to much. just remember thats part of your possesion limit !!!! i let go my bass where i caught him from!!
198857,purekgw,2008-05-08 23:02:00,585,so u can transport them because i go to sturgeon tomorrow and want some perch for tank and possably a walleye if it can fit in tank and have room to swim. when i get money i would like to buy a bigger tank like 100 gallons +
198873,steverowbotham,2008-05-08 23:47:00,1800,yeah you definitely shouldnt keep a walleye in your tank.
198874,irishfield,2008-05-08 23:50:00,26272, NO.. it's illegal to transport live game fish unless you have a permit to do so.
