198352,GBW,2008-05-08 01:46:00,8460,only when talking about raycroft...  LOL
198099,GBW,2008-05-07 19:25:00,8460,"So, is it ok to have one hand on the tiller, the net at your feet and the marshmallows on the console when youâ€™re out on the water?  To bad, I like Paul M as a coach.  I know, I know he never had the respect in the room and from the TO media the second he got the job.  Keep Matts if he wants to play in TO.  To me they need him more then any other player there.  On D start over!!!!!  Can'em all but T.K.  It seams to me that the MLSE has one thing in mind.  Sell out every game (and still have 30% or more of the lower seat empty) and take the cash and not say or do a thing.  They can buy any GOOD player they want under the new cap BUT the good players out there may not want to go to TO as MLSE isn't trying to win the cup, just sell tickets and not care what happens after that..."

198124,chubbon,2008-05-07 20:35:00,15,Give me thirty million dollars and I will build them a winning team :thumbsup_
198128,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-07 20:44:00,3761,"no no no You want to get rid of tucker, blake, and mccabe, and raycroft. sundin still is a very good player and has a few more years to go."
198155,chickenhawk,2008-05-07 21:21:00,612,Sundin is a plug! clean house and start all over again is what i say....but then again i could care less if the leafs win  GO WINGS GO
198159,misfish,2008-05-07 21:27:00,29133,"Well once again the coach gets the axe and not those that POORLY performed. Lets take a look at what they have. Tucker-another Domi,Good for the fans to get going, but not needed these days. GONE. Raycrap,never was a fan,GONE. Tusky,He,s a good goalie,STAYS. Needs a mentor. M. Sundin ,Stays,puts out more then others. N. Antropov ,T. Kaberle ,A. Steen ,A. Ponikarovsky,M. Stajan, no dought staying. B. McCabe ,yes maybe he is wife whipped now,so will be gone,but the leafs still need him. Maturaty will start to play a roll with him. Boyd Devereaux ,Keeper. Jason Blake ,can and will be a great leader. John Pohl ,love his play. Keeper.  As for the rest well do what with as they may. As for the big name player,leafs will never have one,not in the near future anyways. Sundin will be the main stay,and the brand name player for the next 2-4 years. Leaf fan all the way,but the days of Sittler and McDonald and Ellis and Salming are gone. That was a team base.  JMO."
198184,lookinforwalleye,2008-05-07 22:09:00,4399,"Jason Blake a great leader??? your kidding right?  Paul Maurice`s fate was sealed before last season ever started when he stated that this years team has the best collection of talent he had ever coached and they would contend for the cup, obviously the man is not a very good judge of talent or he is a lousy coach,maybe both."
198187,misfish,2008-05-07 22:16:00,29133," No I am NOT kidding. He has heart,probly more then Matts. Give the guy a chance to show it. I dont believe Paul M, is the fault of the leafs. If the players dont listen or give thier heart to the game,then who is to blame????????????? I played for a few coaches that just showed up to be a ""couch"",others were there to ""coach"" you, to preform better and do the team thing the way it was to be. Like I said JMO."
198346,Mattitude,2008-05-08 01:28:00,155,I heard they are going to replace him with Tiger Woods.........as their golfing coach
