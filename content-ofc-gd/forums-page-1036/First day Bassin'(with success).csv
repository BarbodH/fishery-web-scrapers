I struggled for a couple of hours then I found some fish that were willing too eat. In 3 hours I managed to land about 20 or so. The smallest was about 15.5"" and the largest was 20"" the 20"" was 4.9lbs on the dig. scale.  The first 2 shots are the big fish of the day     This one was 4.6lbs    This one was 4.3 lbs and the belly looks like it is going too explode    All the fish were puking up bait as I brought them in.The area I was in was loaded with bait but they still ate my tube offering This my first season of going to the US for the smallies early season hopfully I'll find a 6+lber before the move to their summer locations.  Thanks Rob"

198069,danbo,2008-05-07 18:26:00,2646,Nice fish. Full of eggs too. How big was the bait they coughed-up?
198096,Alumacraft,2008-05-07 19:19:00,139, Color didn't seem to matter as long as it was a dark one.
198097,Alumacraft,2008-05-07 19:21:00,139," The bait was maybe 2 1/2"" - 3"" ."
