198911,Dutch,2008-05-09 00:40:00,831,"Picked up a couple of new finders to upgrade out dated equipment, now for the wiring....  I would like to do some kind of terminal off the battery at the back of the boat with a positive and a negative post.  I would run wires from the battery to the terminal with an in-line fuse, then I would run the wires from the finders and hook up with eyes to the posts on the new terminal.  Anyone know where I could get something like this?  Should I bother, or should I just run the wires directly to the battery terminals?  Also, I need to lengthen the power wires.  Where can I get wire to do this?  They have automotive wire at CTC, but only in single wire and I would need double.  The instructions call for 18 guage multi strand copper wire.  I have some 18 guage speaker wire sitting around, but I don't think that's the way to go...haha.  Any other helpful hints are appreciated."
