198602,Garry2Rs,2008-05-08 14:13:00,1425,In past years one of my non-fishing friends and his family have come up to visit me on the Licence Free Weekend.  They dangle a line and take a boat ride with me etc.  I don't recall seeing anything in the new regulations about Fishing Week or the Licence Free Weekend. Has it been discontinued?
