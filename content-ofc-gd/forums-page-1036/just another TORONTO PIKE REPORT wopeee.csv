196771,snag,2008-05-05 14:35:00,1932,"My master can't even say, ""you have 1 hour to fish""  So his mother translated for him.  1 hour, including travel = 1/2 hour fishing.  I had no intention of fishing but Mommy needed us out of the house so that she could get things done!  The day was perfect; Cloudy light rain Calm Warm(ish)  Master allowed me a few casts and WOW!  This was a great 30-40min. WISH I HAD THE WHOLE DAY!!!!!  Master contemplating my demise   My wife borrowed some eggs from the neighbours. It's a mad, mad world. Run by maniacs. Soiling myself cut into delicate fishing time.    The fishing.  Just like Ben, Ranger and S&M reported; Crazy action! I caught 4-5 around 30"" at the start I had 2 bite offs??? (80lb leader and 30lb line)  Little guys went for the jerk  kinda left the zoom on!   Bigger ones for my secret weapon: ROCKSTAR LURE introducing: THE CLASH! as handmade by Cliff from fishingfury fame. (more to come on these lures!)    Such a cool lure. It's really a treat to see it move through the water!  Mr pike agrees, reluctantly    Sadly, Master needed a diaper change and some more food and the rain was no longer fun. We split.  Ohhhhhhh I truly wish I had the whole day!!!  Next year perhaps.  P.S.  I pulled up along this truck carrying: Weird gold caskets! 2 Arcs? King Tut and Liberace's remains?   Adios  Amigos,  S."
196774,tbayboy,2008-05-05 14:39:00,1497,"Master looks pretty serious there, glad he let you get in a little fishing .  Great report as always - now go enjoy your certified vegan eggs."
196775,fatherof3,2008-05-05 14:48:00,1769,great report and congrats on the fish
196790,Victor,2008-05-05 15:31:00,1609,that's awesome for 40 minutes of fishing. So when's your master going to get his first pike?
196793,Golfisher,2008-05-05 15:37:00,586,"Vegeterian eggs, eh?  Isn't that like marketing vegeterian t-bone steak?  LOL.  I concur with Tbayboy that the master does look pretty serious; I wouldn't mess with him either.  BTW, what's up with these handle changes?  Snag, Snog, Snag, and now Snap?  Enjoyable reading, as always."
196853,mepps,2008-05-05 18:10:00,1301,"Nicely done my friend, glad the lrues are producing for ya!"
196869,highdrifter,2008-05-05 18:24:00,2534,I'm not worthy..  You're pikeyness has surparsed my expectations.  You've attained the rank of...  Pussywillow!  cheers HD
196903,ehg,2008-05-05 19:06:00,2666,"Nice going, great HONEST quirky report as usual.  Tried fishing from shore there w/ daughter when she was 2 or 3, it was a no go. Maybe we will run into each other there one day.  Peace,  ehg"
196924,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-05 19:40:00,241,"Nice work dude! You, myself and High Drifter should hit it up later this week. Thursday or Friday perhaps?"
196951,snag,2008-05-05 20:37:00,1932," He's a serious dude. Maybe he saw the eggs on the table!   He'll out-fish me soon I fear.   I'm a messed-up train wreck. That's all   You're just jealous.   You know Erik, I bet it will happen like that too. As for honesty, that pike was 30lbs and dropped a golden egg on my foot.( before it turned into a butterfly and carried my son to a land of chocolate where gumdrop pigmies crowned him their king)   Um, Things are looking grim Billy. We shall be in touch. Thurs. looks nice and rainy"
196973,ScarSnake,2008-05-05 21:12:00,20,Cool report. Could be for a movie shoot?
197310,snag,2008-05-06 03:22:00,1932,"Actually,  I did hear that a new sequel for the ""Mummy"" was being partially shot here.hmmmmmm"
197329,snagmaster,2008-05-06 04:17:00,250,nice fish man....like the funky homemade bucktail
197341,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-06 07:14:00,435,Nice Pike SNAG!!! Even with your tricky backgrounds I can still tell exactly where your fishing! lol  -Ben
197398,Mike the Pike,2008-05-06 12:27:00,3421,Did you Snap or what no more SNAG  Nice gators
197928,MJL,2008-05-07 13:40:00,2427,Great report SNAP.  Love the pics.  Beautifully made spinners as well.   What about snog? LOL
197967,mattyk,2008-05-07 15:13:00,2110,"nice looking fish, thansk for the report."
198041,Joey,2008-05-07 17:08:00,9122,"Great report Snag.  Vegan eggs     What's the point  Those are some crazy caskets.  Will be interesting to see if they make an appearance in the Mummy movie.  Nice pike for sure and I really like the looks of that Clash Lure.  Been dabbling in luremaking myself and that one is sweet!!! (Oh great, now I'm into lure porn   )  Joey"
198082,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-07 18:48:00,0,Great Report and nice Pike!
198092,dheitzner,2008-05-07 19:08:00,314," I think that they're actually concrete vaults that you put in the ground (lid off)before the casket.  The casket is then placed inside,  the lid of the vault is put back on, and the whole works is covered with earth."
198109,snag,2008-05-07 19:57:00,1932, Rumour has it that Clive tests each lures strength by suspending himself from them.  You're so hot you are a lure. You just smile and the fish will jump on your lap!    Makes sense.  What a waste of space and nutrients for the soil!
198194,Tootsie II,2008-05-07 22:25:00,162,"Take it from a part time cemetery manager that those are burial vaults. The casket goes inside them and the concrete lid goes on top before the grave is backfilled. They are optional in most cemeteries but mandatory in some if that's approved in Ontario by the provincial Ministry of Consumer and Business Affairs. The funeral directors like them because for about a five minute phone call to the supplier, they usually make at least a 100% profit on them. The vaults help minimize the ground settlement over the years but don't do much to stop nature from taking its course with the remains."
198316,Rizzo,2008-05-08 00:50:00,4754,"As a funeral director I will agree that those are without a doubt burial vaults, but disagree about the ""at least 100% profit"" comment.  I know we don't make anywhere near that amount.  In any place where competition exists (ie another funeral home in the town, or the cemetery also sells burial vaults) the profit margin on a vault is around 50 %...now if you're the only show in town...who knows what you might charge (although if you are the only place in town, you're obviously in a small place and burying all your friends and neighbours so that also usually keeps the prices realistic!)."
198322,Tinman,2008-05-08 00:59:00,376,great report! not too sure about the eggs though......
198325,ccmtcanada,2008-05-08 01:05:00,7971,Another great pike report from the master!  Your son is growing up fast!!!  He's looking pretty close to accompanying dad on some weekend excursions. Sweet lures too... step up from the dollarama lures (not that there's anything wrong with them....LOL).
