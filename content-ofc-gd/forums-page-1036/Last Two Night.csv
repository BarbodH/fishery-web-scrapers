197990,anders,2008-05-07 15:53:00,1168,"Hey all  Well since the ice just left all the lakes in the last week or so, we decided to go for some ice out lakers on Monday night and then for some Specks last night.  We new we would catch some fish, but the size and the numbers we did not expect. We started monday night and after the first pass over a point, in 4 fow, we start. After a little tussel this 4 lber of so is boated, quick snap of the camera and back to swim.   Shortly after, Jay get a tap and sets is hook into this solid fish.  This one was caught trolling through a weed bed in 8 fow.   We continued to troll up and down the shoreline and boated 3 more lakers, one of which was another laker about 8-9lbs, and these two scrappy lakers.  All lakers went back to swim, as it was just fun to get out and catch them.  We ended up going 5 for 7 that night.     The next night we decided to go into a back lake for some specks. Thinking we might get the odd speck that would be 12-14 inches, we started to troll again.  We started fishing at 6 and had the truck loaded by 830.  We caught 10 specks all from 14-20 inches and kept 4 for a nice meal tongiht.  The first of many   A fine beauty   My big one of the night   Jays 1 of many   Nice little female   A fine meal indeed.   Cheers,  Anders"
