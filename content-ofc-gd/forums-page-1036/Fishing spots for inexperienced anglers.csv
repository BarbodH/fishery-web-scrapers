197319,snag,2008-05-06 03:42:00,1932," Agreed,  This website can be an open book most of the time for the best general fishing spots in Ontario.  That requires a sense of stewardship.  Not meant to be an attack Mikey, but the site your a member of isn't exactly an ""open"" site. I can't go there right now and view any full report without being a member, can I.  Is That worse than blurring?  We all practice discretion with important information until a level of trust is established. Just like your site has rightly done Mikey. If I understand correctly, that trust is the essence of your site?  MJL, always seem to agree with you!   S."
197332,Danubian,2008-05-06 04:37:00,65,How's Tommy Thompson Park in Toronto/Lake Ontario? Looking at the satellite picture in Google Maps there are bays where the carp may very well be living. Anyone fished there?  Danubian
197334,mikeymikey,2008-05-06 04:59:00,376,"Uh oh, my background checked again... But it's ok, I've already been background checked by Transport Canada, RCMP & FBI.  Anyways... yes I do agree with SNAP that we all practice discretion with important information until a level of trust is established.   I've only joined different site which is taking different approach. Some people don't like change but I like change."
197345,OhioFisherman,2008-05-06 08:59:00,6623,"Lake Erie! Note that fish swim, this is called movement, this also may vary depending on seasonal conditions, water clarity, food supply, water temps, ect.. A better question may be techniques for locating then.  If you depend on spots? expect to hear you should have been here yesterday, last week, ect. I wouldn`t want some else to hit a home run so I could run the bases.  If you need spots? get one of these to hit them!  http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/...sy_fishing.html"
197349,Big Cliff,2008-05-06 09:55:00,6899,"Over the years I have shared many many fishing spots with others, heck, that's how I met up with Rick on a fishing trip to the French River a lot of years ago. Some of that sharing has resulted in wonderful and long lasting friendships. Sure there have been a few occasions where the information has been taken and used without as much as an acknowledgement of my efforts, sometimes even abused but for the most part it has been respected.  One of the things that gives me much pleasure in life is trying to help others be it fishing or anything else and believe me I have been rewarded many times over. I can't even start to count the times members of this board alone have done things to help me, a recent example would be when I posted asking for help to put my dock in this year, the turn out was spectacular!  I am a little more careful now on how I give out information on spots etc. I don't post it openly on the internet anymore, many of the places I fish are places that others have shown or taken me. I feel that if they want to share those places then it is up to them.  I do think that a lot of it has to do with how you ask. ""Could anyone tell me some good fishing spots?"" isn't going to get you nearly as much help as ""I am planning a trip to Sturgeon Lake in July to do some fishing and wondered if anyone could give me some pointers on where, what, and how to fish there?"" being a little more specific in the kind of help you are looking for will give you more specific answeres.  If anyone asks me for help now I try to share some of what I do know and will give out some of the spots I have found on my own but I tend to do it by email or PM, I've just found that to be a better way and I must admit that the level of help I give is usually related to the level of willingness to help I have seen the asker demonstrate themselves."
197728,ironstone74,2008-05-07 00:50:00,201,"I am torn reading this post and I would like some tips on good Steelhead spots!  What I find tough is making time to scout out new locations; I have 3 young kids and I work a lot.  I have more time to learn about techniques and research online than I do out on the rivers.  I can't spend half a day hiking through a river 2 hours from my house with the hopes of finding a honey hole. Anyway, thanks for the tips, and to those who believe in tough fish love - fair enough.  It takes a lot of leg work to find new fishing turf. I got a lead on a new spot and I am going to slam'em next week!  Paul"

198147,JohnF,2008-05-07 21:09:00,3494, I've offered to show a few folks my favourite spots (the ones I'm actually tired of but they work) but they seem to lose interest when I tell 'em they gotta wet wade to get there. What is it with people who are afraid to get their legs wet? I don't usually tell the bloodsucker stories till we get well up the creek.  JF

198168,highdrifter,2008-05-07 21:45:00,2534," Carp are to be had pretty much anywhere in Lake O.  No secret there.  However, if I could help, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority does have a free shuttle service on weekends that runs from the entrance of the park to the very tip of the park.  There's plenty of shallow bays and inlets there, perfect for that particular coarse fish...  There, my good deed for the day.  Good luck!  HD"

198280,chickenhawk,2008-05-08 00:00:00,612,that i can say where i caught....lol below the locks in Lindsay! you can actually get some good fishing in there.....you can catch walleye there all year but they are best in the spring....we've caught musky there and smallies and i even lost a big catfish once....
197306,Sinker,2008-05-06 03:13:00,8692,"I don't post many spots on the web, but if someone pm'ed me and asked nicely, I'd give them all the detailed info they'd need.......with a reminder to keep it on the down low. Not that I'm greedy, I just don't need a bunch of guys fishing my go to spots. There is just something about sharing my info with the whole world that I don't like. Sharing with another fisherman, one on one, or face to face at the boat launch is another story all together......I'll tell them everything.....I've even gave away my lure that was catching!  I didn't have the web when I started looking for spots. I just went and fished.......and I was happy doing that. Now I pretty much fish the spots that produced when I went searching........the search is half of the adventure!  Sinker"

197318,Greencoachdog,2008-05-06 03:39:00,8163,"The find your own spot method is a little program i like to refer to as ""Tough Fishing Love"", it's hard... but they'll be better fishermen for it!  That's not to say that I wouldn't take a newb out and show him some of my techniques if I lived closer, I would... but don't sit around and wait for somebody to lead you around by the hand, get out and explore. My best fishin' spots are just that because I found them myself!!!  If a newb is a member of this board and wants to find places to fish, all he really has to do is READ AND PAY ATTENTION!!! There are plenty of spots mentioned on this board all the time without even having to start a ""spots for newbies"" thread.     So how many newbies are you taking fishin' with you this weekend jonnybass???"
196747,brickNblock,2008-05-05 13:54:00,598," Im pretty sure the residents of Whitevale would not be pleased to have read this anywhere... They have been trying to cut off access areas to anglers for years.....theyve also spent a tremendous amount of monies and time in rebuilding the banks of their stream. I found this exact location more than 35 yrs ago by accident walking the river from the south...miles south. These residents take great pride in their waterway to the point that local public school students are taken down there on school excursions to see the spawn and trout runs every year. They despise the out of town anglers who trash their waters and the banks....as well the no parking areas the angler parks in that are covered in litter by garbage they leave behind.  Im not bashing you johnnybass......its just not a good idea at all to post on the internet. This is why we have the hookups section. I was a newbie to musky fishing 5-6 yrs ago.....(well, after being away from it for some 40 years anyway) I was also a newbie to icefishing 9-10 yrs ago.... I just learned to study each species...everything that I could find written about the subject or on video. The AdventureMaps books were great beginner tools...but none better then actually getting out on your own and approaching anglers already there and learning from them. Look what happened to the TO Islands after all the posting some 5 years back right here on this board.....Ill admit, I was one of the newbies then too........Now there are fewer and fewer locations there that can be acessed.  H O O K U P - S E C T I O N........thats where it belongs."
196752,bigfish1965,2008-05-05 14:04:00,3382,"There are tons of places like Valens, St. Johns Conservation Area (Fonthill...tons of trout) and other stocked ponds that are perfect for beginners. Since these are put-and-take fisheries, they can be published without fear of wrecking someones 'honey hole'."
196769,Victor,2008-05-05 14:30:00,1609,Many great places to fish in and around our own backyard.  MNR Urban Fishing Opportunity
196785,shane,2008-05-05 15:18:00,652,I don't mind telling beginners where to go.  But I'll send them to beginners spots that are generally well known anyhow.  Any newbies in the London area looking for a place to start should try below Fanshawe dam.  Lot's of big carp that like corn niblets and can be a good spot for smallies when the season opens.  Also occasional pike and perch and silver bass and rock bass and suckers etc.  Good place to take kids.
196797,Golfisher,2008-05-05 15:43:00,586,"I wish I had enough knowledge to actually share with someone.  All that I know are carp holes, and these are found pretty much every bay and inlet in Lake O.  Man, I need to get out more."
196798,Zubris21,2008-05-05 15:44:00,563,"I have no problem telling newbies good spots, or well known spots.  I may keep the best of the best for myself or close friends, but giving away a location is only part of the secret, gear, tackle and presentation has a lot to do with your success as an angler as well.  I also find if kind of curious that many of you are concerned with the environmental impact, increased anglers will have on your riverbanks, lake shores, parking lots, etc.  I can appreciate that increased traffic relates directly to more garbage and pollution, and no one wants to see our pristine waters get any worse.   On the other hand I think that angling is a great outdoor ""introduction"" sport for many individuals.  Lets face it, less and less people are spending time outside in the wild, appreciating the beauty that Ontario, and furthermore Canada has to offer.  I truly believe that by introducing more people to fishing, they are more likely to fall in love with the natural environment, and show more concern for it.  The more people that are concerned about the state of a riverbank or section of forest, the better.  With that said beginner anglers aren't likely to enjoy their time, or become ""hooked"" on the outdoors if they do not begin in a productive location, catching fish is just more fun when your just starting out and that is really your only goal.  so I can't help with GTA locations, but Kingston Mills locks can be a great spot from spring-fall for pan fish, bass, pike, carp, gar and suckers when they're in season and I've also heard of muskie being caught there.  Also although I've only ever seen pictures, there is supposed to be a fairly good run of trout and salmon in the fall."
