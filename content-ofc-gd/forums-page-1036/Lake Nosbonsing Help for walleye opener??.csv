This occurs when the water rises and reaches 40 plus degree range.  Sometimes rapids or dams will concentrate these fish.  Try jigs on these spring-run fish. White, yellow, chartreuse and pink are good colors; the proper sizes can range from 1/8 to 1/2 ounce, depending on the current and depth. Both plain jigs with either a soft-plastic tail, minnow or pork rind. Cast the offering out and across or slightly upstream, let it sink near the bottom and reel back slowly and steadily with an occasional twitch or lift of the rod tip.  2. One of the best ways to catch spawning-run walleyes is with a floating/diving thin minnow plug rigged with extra weight. Tie the lure onto an 18-inch leader off of a three-way swivel with a few split shot trailing on a short 6-inch dropper leader fastened to the third eyelet. Cast and retrieve this offering slowly and steadily near or just off the bottom. If you hang up, you'll usually lose just the split shot and not your expensive lure.  3. Try a plain live minnow for spawning-run walleyes. Sometimes in cold water - a plain live minnow is the way to go. Hook a minnow through the lips from the bottom up on a size 1 to 4 hook and add a couple of split shot a foot or two up the line. Cast upstream and allow the bait to settle near the bottom.  Begin a slow reel stop pumping retrieve. Reel the rod and let it settle back down. Expect extra weight and not a hard strike on the line followed by the walleye feels the hook and then feed a little more line for a count to ten then set the hook.  4. Crankbaits are great for casting. You need to know of the different actions available. Lures with subtle action include Rapala Husky Jerks, Bombers and similar models. Moderate action  Rapala Shad Rap and Rebel Shad-Rap.  Experiment with them on any given day. Watch for fish that follow your lure but don't strike. Or switch to a different action when your combing of a prime piece of water doesn't get results."
