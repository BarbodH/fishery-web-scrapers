198366,purekgw,2008-05-08 02:12:00,585,damn that thing attacked me i would prob snap its neck
198368,huntervasili,2008-05-08 02:19:00,1604,snap!
198369,iceguy,2008-05-08 02:20:00,341,That thing was crazy.
198373,Mattones,2008-05-08 02:23:00,587,That is so funny. I love the end how he is gunning it and all you can hear is the goose.  'OH MY DAWG!'
198378,johnnyb,2008-05-08 02:28:00,3413,Was that greencoachdog?  Sounded like a hogswaller accent
198384,gone_fishin,2008-05-08 02:33:00,481,"you must have disturbed it's nest... i can't see any other reason for it attacking you like that.  i got dive-bombed by a robin when i was young, i was climbing an apple tree in my grandparent's apple orchard where this bird had it's nest... it was a similar scene to your incident...  those things are fearless when it comes to protecting their young."
198390,Sinker,2008-05-08 02:38:00,8692,Looks like he had a nice chessy in the boat with him. I would have let the dog have at er.......  GABBY......BACK!!  Why can't they do that when season is open.  Sinker
198403,huntervasili,2008-05-08 02:53:00,1604," My bro got attacked by a swan a few years ago... bit him on the leg, I had to kick it off of him, it was the size of him at the time. Crazy things!"
198405,shane,2008-05-08 02:55:00,652,This isn't my video.  I just came across it on youtube.  I think it's got something to do with global warming.
198408,Greencoachdog,2008-05-08 02:57:00,8163,  Not me...    ... I wouldn't be caught dead in a tiller in Alabama!!!
198409,e-z-out,2008-05-08 02:59:00,1052,That goose would have been dinner But could have been on gard like most of them are at this time of year. Watch out for nest and stay away or your going to get your johnson nipped at.
198415,Sinker,2008-05-08 03:03:00,8692, Looks like a center console to me Glen.......prolly why the goose was attacking him
198419,Greencoachdog,2008-05-08 03:23:00,8163, On second look... looks more like a Garbage Scow.
198421,Live2Fish83,2008-05-08 03:29:00,26,That was pretty funny  a few weeks ago i had encountered the same thing...some geese took my fishing spot they had there nest there but luckily they didn't attack me!
198560,Tacklebuster,2008-05-08 13:41:00,303,"that was just helarious.  The back ground sounds like he was in a wrestling match with the goose, too funny."
198592,Fishmaster,2008-05-08 13:58:00,920,My dog would have had that goose by the neck ...and  can you say Smoked goose Zoe loves Smoked Goose ...ive watched the geese on my rocks chasen people around while fishing it pretty funny to watch ..
198599,nuke,2008-05-08 14:09:00,60,Good thing that wasn't Chuck Norris' boat  !!!  Nuke
198609,bigfish1965,2008-05-08 14:18:00,3382,"Had a similar thing happen when my golden was a puppy. Me and a goose had quite the fight. They bite quite hard. I would have killed it, but there was lots of kids around. So instead I get into a 20 minute yelling and wrestling match as the thing goes after my dog. Eventually a few others joined in the fight till the goose gave up. Now when I go down to that conservation area, I always find me a 'walking stick' first. I would imagine had someone video taped it, it would have been quite funny to watch."
198692,Photoz,2008-05-08 15:49:00,792,"I was teasing a goose & gander up at Scugog in the park when the fishin' was a bit slow a few years ago, making like I was going for their 2 or 3 day old goslings . . .     the gander hissed several warnings, but when that didn't work, he flew right at me . . .   I got whacked several times before I managed a fast retreat! Those wings actually hurt, eh! I've also seen them go after playful unleashed dogs that try to 'investigate' the family! They can certainly be VERY protective of their offspring!"
