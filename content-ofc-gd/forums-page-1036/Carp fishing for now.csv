In the mean time, I have decided to aimed for carp, and I am hooked.  I landed 6 out of 10 fish on monday. The largest being 10lb+. We were using corn the whole time. I can get used to this if it was not difficult in the past. We were all using hair rig and corn.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...album/carp4.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...album/carp3.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...album/carp2.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...album/carp1.jpg   The other OFC buddy sharper caught a 25+lb carp.
