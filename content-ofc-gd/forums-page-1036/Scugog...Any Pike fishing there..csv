198819,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-08 21:53:00,3761,Just wondering if Lake Scugog in Port Perry has pike. If so what ideas do you have for pike fishing off the shore...not just at this lake at any lake ?
198821,keram,2008-05-08 21:56:00,585,"No pike in Scugog, at least not yet."
198826,mepps,2008-05-08 22:04:00,1301,No musky either
198829,keram,2008-05-08 22:08:00,585,"""No musky either  ""   They will show up on Muskie opener"
