198486,lew,2008-05-08 11:55:00,12767,"I got home yesterday to find a package on the front porch containing the latest Cabellas book.  A hard covered catalogue with 1510 pages of products and although I haven't had a chance to go thru it too thoroughly yet, I'm thinking it may contain about everything sold by Cabellas.  It's called the Limited Spring Edition 2008 and should make for some very expensive reading  Anyone else receive one ??"
198487,kickingfrog,2008-05-08 11:56:00,8333,I'm running out now to check my mail.
198488,Whopper,2008-05-08 11:58:00,2174,"Yep I got one to Lew.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, thinking I'll wait a couple weeks"
198490,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-08 12:02:00,957,Yep.  Only the best consumers receive those.
198491,kickingfrog,2008-05-08 12:02:00,8333,None for me. There was a BPS flyer though.
198505,BillM,2008-05-08 12:22:00,17367,What the hell is up with BPS?  I put an online request for a catalog months ago and still haven't gotten anything. Although I get all their flyers.  #$%#$%#$  I need some new bathroom reading material
198506,Stoty,2008-05-08 12:22:00,2910,Ebay...for all your fishing needs....LOL  Just bought a lot of 14 Xraps yesterday for $88.00. Cant get much cheaper than that!
198510,Billy Bob,2008-05-08 12:27:00,5865,I get two of these huge catalogs from Cabela's each year not to mention some kind of catalog each WEEK ! ! !  I guess they know when they got a big sucker on the line
198515,Seaweed,2008-05-08 12:34:00,135,Generally you have to buy a certain amount of stuff from them before you get the hardcover catalogue .... didn't you buy your new Lowrance from them Lew?  I know that I got the hardcover catalogue shortly after buying my Marcum LX-5 from them.  I think that means over $500 dollars purchasing customer.  Nice book though for sure.
198520,lew,2008-05-08 12:49:00,12767," Yup and they certainly must have appreciated my $$$$ cause I get flyers and small books practically weekly plus I also get email flyers quite often too.  I like the fact that they appreciate customers and keep them up to date on deals.  Funny thing too, I was in the local Dominion store recentely looking over the magazine section and saw a BPS catalogue on sale for $5.....why would anybody spend money to buy a catalogue to decide what they want to spend money on ??"
198523,Fishn Technishn,2008-05-08 12:51:00,198,Cabelas!! WOW! I visited my first Cabelas last weekend in Hammond Ind. on the way back from Chicago.  What a store!! Definitely better stocked than ANY BassPro I have been in( that's quite a few)> The staff were so helpful that they were ALMOST  a pest. Was an expensive bathroom break!! Tons of Musky stuff!!!(LEW). I will be making my annual Father's Day trip to Cabelas this year rather than BPS! I gotta call them and ask where MY catalog is!!!  FT
