198228,Muskieman,2008-05-07 23:01:00,2472,"I was having my morning coffee down at the town docks... my daughter noticed a Beaver , I always have a camera with me....  I made the pics smaller to fit here  but at the most was 4 feet away from the beast..  The second the FLASH went off he/she slapped it's tail on the ground and *barked* like a dog and then growled at me... so i then turned off my flash and took a few more..as I took a few steps back."
198229,irishfield,2008-05-07 23:05:00,26272,Oh Man Randy... there are so many things I could say about barking Beavers.
198233,steve_paul,2008-05-07 23:09:00,658, Barking ones don't scare me but the snapping ones are downright nasty  Nice pics Randy.

198240,GbayGiant,2008-05-07 23:24:00,1780,"Lol, I've had that happen before, nothing worse than a grumpy beaver."
198243,Gerritt,2008-05-07 23:29:00,6129,That Beaver looks nice and wet... I wonder though... because it looked so delicious.. did you poke it with your stick?
198249,Hookset,2008-05-07 23:34:00,367,"I have found that there are certain messages in the slapping and barking done by Beavers.  Slapping means...""Eventually I'm gonna end up with all your money""  the Barking means...""Then I'm gonna go after your pension""  If you come across one in the wild, feign drunkenness, and mumble the words ""Momma keeps takin' my earnings ta' feed our twelve young'uns""  They won't bother you.    Cool pics Randy   Hookset."
198271,steve_paul,2008-05-07 23:52:00,658,"You have some aggressive Beaver up your way.  Last May 24 long weekend I took my son and his friend out and we were stalking some French River Beaver.  This one let me get close enough for a pic    But when we got to close to her, she really let us have it  "

198284,bowshep,2008-05-08 00:04:00,378,l hear you have to cook the heck out of them because they are greasy. What vegetables would you have carrots and zucchini. Or just potato's with sour cream.  Ken
