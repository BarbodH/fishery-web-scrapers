774447,Pigeontroller,2013-03-19 00:12:00,2793, That would be someone with some soul...
774481,nitropaul,2013-03-19 03:03:00,5,this is one of the pictures of the tanks i found now you see why we need to get rid of these tanks
774483,Lenwaltenberry,2013-03-19 03:14:00,18,Wow do you have more pics? Can u email me them at [emailÂ protected] Did u find these all in the water or most on land? I know some people that need to see your pictures... Are you sure these still there?
774486,nitropaul,2013-03-19 03:29:00,5,they are all still in the water when i took my boat out this year i have talked to afew mnr people and hopefully they get taken care of .they are all over the southend if you go to the ministries warning of blue green algae you will see at the south end of the warning picture and go to the big island southern point you find the location of the inlet that they are hid behind.
774490,Lenwaltenberry,2013-03-19 03:41:00,18,I wonder why they were dumped? Makes no sence being they are valued for scrap metal.
774493,nitropaul,2013-03-19 03:52:00,5,if you can get them out of the ice go for it i dont think anyone would complain but dont take my word for it but the recycler in enismore would like them but i dont know his name or web site to tell him where they are.
774533,nancur373,2013-03-19 12:45:00,1211,Looks like an old floating dock
774534,nitropaul,2013-03-19 12:53:00,5,they could have been from the old trucking road from the lumber road
774627,Sinker,2013-03-19 23:12:00,8692,I'm thinking its an old floating dock too. I guess getting them is out of the question right now.  S.
350147,majorlifts,2009-06-09 14:15:00,171,"  Unfortunately this is the way of the new world, the old ways are gone, and the old ways of thinking have taken a back seat to development and big money. I`m sure when the Cree wrote that things weren`t as bad for them on their little pieces of land they were unjustifiably put on with clauses dating as far back as the late 1890`s that now have no power so big mining companies  can go on the land and do as they please with out any recourse. Exactly whats happening with the Ardoch in Algonquin. What the papers tell you and whats really going on, is a whole different ball game.  http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/1754  But then you are right, there are those who are just like the people they protest and they sometimes sell out for the cash."
350308,Jonny,2009-06-09 20:53:00,1380,"Well it is Southern Ontario, and not that far from Toronto and other heavy populations.  The good news is that a lot of weekend cottagers don't fish much.  And if there's a prohibition on docks and ""improvements"" within 100+ feet of the shoreline, maybe some of the aesthetic quality will be preserved.  I guess owners of these properties would need the services of two marinas - one on the shore and one on the island. I suppose that if you can afford the price of a lot, afford to build on it and afford the taxes, you can afford the slip fees."
350332,Billy Bob,2009-06-09 21:25:00,5865, Folks that spend that kind of money on a summer home usually don't fish at ALL.............:<)
418417,musky_bowman,2010-01-04 02:14:00,1,"i really hope that big island is left alone and doesnt sell to a developer everytime im on the water fishing i cant help not to look at it i like knowing its a big beutiful natural island where wildlife have a sanctuary of there own , its what makes pigeon lake special and gives us all something back"
418430,Rizzo,2010-01-04 03:02:00,4754,"Only fished pigeon once, but I can picture the island you're talking about. Can't blame the people for selling/developing it. Hard to argue with 5 million. I tell you right now I'd sell it in a heartbeat, buy myself an awesome spot on a private lake (where I own all the shoreline!) and still have a few million in the bank."
418530,lhousesoccer,2010-01-04 16:15:00,442,"I know we all dream of such a thing, but what you said kind of epitomizes the problems we are facing in the future with land development, water rights, and public access issues.  If everyone who could, did what you said, there would be no natural, wild lands or waters left, and the little that did remain, would be privately owned like your dream.  Not a good scenario."
418563,jediangler,2010-01-04 18:25:00,1923,I wouldn't be surprised if the price went up now that Pigeon lake is a year round fishery.
696768,Lenwaltenberry,2012-05-16 10:55:00,18,Is there any update on this topic? I understand the island was sold two years ago but can't find any info on what the future of the island will be?  Have people been banned from setting foot on this island as of yet?
769789,nancur373,2013-02-24 00:15:00,1211,Yeah...is there any update? Haven't been that far up the lake yet but will when i get the new motor.
769855,beertech,2013-02-24 15:19:00,118,I have a cottage on the mainland on the backside on the island and have been  told a single richguy bought the island with plans of one cottage.  I heard boyond that there wont be permits for water or septic.  It was my first year on the lake so dont take this as fact just what my neighbor told me.  He is the head of our association so i would assume he;s in the know
769869,nancur373,2013-02-24 16:30:00,1211,thanks
769892,Sinker,2013-02-24 17:29:00,8692,Nobody has stopped us from setting foot on the island yet. I go there every chance I get.  S.
770141,jimmer,2013-02-25 21:11:00,2730,"Yes there is. Not sure it will ever be developed, have any of you been reading about the northwest sewer trunk issue in Lindsay, or how long it took to get that new bridge built south of Bobcaygeon. Can't imagine a bridge or causeway ever being built to go to big island or septic systems being approved."
770146,Lenwaltenberry,2013-02-25 21:16:00,18,That small cabin is still on that rock of an island.
770147,Lenwaltenberry,2013-02-25 21:18:00,18,Camping on the big island (Boyd island) inspired me to buy my own island.  www.facebook.com/survivorislandoasis
770199,T-Bone,2013-02-26 00:24:00,160,Red Rock Island...lots of good memories of fishing and way pointing off of that. I know some owners up there and will see what I can find out.
770268,fishindevil,2013-02-26 10:53:00,6254,He proposes to build 99 lots of 1 acre each they did have a sign on the backside of the island as well they plan on a marina there as well !!! There was meetings and input a few years ago and a lot if red tape surrounding it !!!! I'm pretty sure there was a thread about this 2 yrs ago ?? I'm not aware if any new information regarding the development ??? But now I'm curious and will try to find out more !!!! My family was born and raised in bobcaygeon and I have been going to the island since I was a kid it would be a shame to see it all ruined it sure is a gem
770272,Roy,2013-02-26 12:22:00,13728,Here's a link to some discussion we've had on it. http://http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=32850
770287,irishfield,2013-02-26 14:30:00,26272,lol Roy!  Private land... private most likely before the crown stuff was bought around the shore..
774355,nitropaul,2013-03-18 14:48:00,5,I was fishing around the south end of big island in the summer and found at least 50 if not 60 discarded oil tanks for oil burning furnaces piled in behind the trees adjacent to the small island contacted wil wegman of mnr and he is going to speak with mnr peterborough to have something done about this hopefully they can track down one of the owners of these tanks and they can find out who dumped them there.also can anyone tell me how to post pictures
774357,lew,2013-03-18 14:59:00,12766," Are you talking about the big 200 gallon tanks ??  Those things are big, awkward and heavy and it doesn't make sense that someone would go to the trouble of loading them into a boat, one or two at a time, hauling them across the water and then carrying them back on shore again...that's really weird !!"
774360,ehg,2013-03-18 15:14:00,2666,"HaHa! That link goes back to this thread.   All this talk of development of 99 lots etc,,,,,has been going on for 15-20 yrs. At least it is  going at a slow pace.  Some of best fishing i have had in southern Ontario for SM bass, walleye, and musky has been around this island. Hopefully they don't screw up this great fishery."
774367,Sinker,2013-03-18 15:45:00,8692,"It wouldn't be too hard to haul those tanks across the ice, Lew.  I could use one of those for a maple sap boiler....I might have to go take a look before the ice goes out lol   S."
774373,ecmilley,2013-03-18 15:57:00,2163,"yeah you want some help ? could drag a couple over for you on the sled, give me an excuse to get out"
774399,SylvanOwner,2013-03-18 18:54:00,266,My old Director who has a cottage nearby was telling me the other weekend that a single individual has purchased all the privately owned land on the island and has no intent to develop.  Let's hope this is true.
349038,JeffBornFishin,2009-06-07 00:37:00,260,"Well I have been away from the board for some time as I have been sick for the past few weeks.  Now that I am feeling better I hit the boat today looking forward to the 'ski opener.  Big wind and big waves...nothing new including no big fish...the weather this season just plain sucks.  Decided to get outta the wind this afternoon and went up the back channel behind Big Island on Pigeon Lake.  I noticed a large group of boats concentrated around the middle of the Island so I went over to see what was up.  A very large for sale sign has appeared...everyone was looking at it dumbfounded.  It reads:  For Sale, 1,120 Acre Island approved for 95 waterfront lots.  Now I always thought that this was either Crown land or belonged to the township of CKL  I have taken a pic of it not the greatest quality...    There are no services that go to this Island that I am aware of and it has the nicest natural shoreline in the area.  Why mess this up.  Here is another pic looking south...was a popular fishing spot today.    Anyone else got any info on this being for sale?  All I managed today were a bunch of WGSF"
349042,Greencoachdog,2009-06-07 00:45:00,8163,I think you and the Addy should buy it and donate one of the 95 lots to me and Ol' Yeller... we'd be much obliged yanno!
349043,JeffBornFishin,2009-06-07 00:48:00,260, If I had that kind of money I would buy and it leave it undeveloped as is.  You should buy one of the nice half million dollar jobs just south of there at the former Three Bouys House Boats...  Only one is finished and another has been started
349044,BITEME,2009-06-07 00:50:00,1968,"Thats been in the works for a very long time that is why they shutdown tall cedars it was meant to be the acess point over to the island its to bad really i have always enjoyed a shore lunch and a sleep there nice area to fish got some decent ski""s around it"
349046,Pigeontroller,2009-06-07 00:58:00,2793,There's been talk of developing Boyd Island for 20 years or more...
349051,jediangler,2009-06-07 01:15:00,1923,I always thought that the island was owned by first nations people.
349205,fishdawg,2009-06-07 14:35:00,912,dang 
349307,Jer,2009-06-07 19:28:00,1426,  Half a million dollars? You wish! Double that and you might be getting close.
349310,Jer,2009-06-07 19:38:00,1426,"This Big Island development has been in the works for at least a couple years. My understanding is that the shoreline, for the most part, is to remain undisturbed. The houses all need to be set-back at least 100' (may have even been 200') from the shore.  The one house completed at Three Bouys is owned by a friend of my neighbour and they have similiar restrictions in place. He is not allowed a dock on his shoreline and also not allowed any landscaping within a certain distance of the shore. There is a central lagoon/marina on the property and all boats must be kept there. Funny thing is, with only one home built, all kinds of brand-new docking appeared in the lagoon over this past winter. There looks to be enough slips for every property on-site, must be included with your lot.  I would imagine the Big Island development would also have some sort of centralized marina for the residents but I could be wrong."
349329,joonmoon,2009-06-07 20:10:00,528,"Ok, all those in favour of pooling our $ and buying the entire island say ""I""."

349344,Pigeontroller,2009-06-07 20:57:00,2793,Disgusting!
349345,Billy Bob,2009-06-07 20:57:00,5865,  I rented from 3 Bouys Houseboats around 1987.......they had great NEW 40' houseboats that year. One of the best vacations I ever spent with my family and in-laws......  As far as the no dock restriction now imposed on that property but rather a marina where you must dock your boat.... that sounds like something the land developer got passed to further enrich his pockets......otherwise it really makes no sense to me.
349353,Sinker,2009-06-07 21:14:00,8692,"The sad part is someone will buy it, and it will get developed at some point. Why can't people just leave good things alone. Friggen mighty dollar rules all!!  I've always wondered who actually owned that island, and why there were no buildings on it. Its a great spot for shore lunch!  Sinker"
349361,JohnF,2009-06-07 21:22:00,3494,"Money rules. You can't stop progress, especially when it's backed by money. Rest assured that if the dollars make sense it will sell, and it will be developed. Perhaps the tax situation in the Kawarthas is better than in the Muskokas. That alone could draw crowds of end users.  JF"
349364,Sinker,2009-06-07 21:25:00,8692,"Hopefully some sap will buy it, and the final plan won't be approved...... .......it is just a draft for now. I'm sure residents in the area aren't going to be too happy about this either, as well as the thousands of people who use the island for recreation. I think it should be donated to someone who will preserve it.......... I know, I'm dreaming!!!  S."
349375,Billy Bob,2009-06-07 21:55:00,5865,"What you need to do is get one of MANY good do'ers that reside here in WNY and rally the troops to prevent any progress on that island.....they have been VERY successful here doing just that. Walmart has been there biggest target but just about anything that is ever proposed here has some kind of group or another rise up and defeat the building of ANY job bearing progress  in WNY........why you can't even cut down your own tree here now a days because of these people.......without saying we have no jobs here any longer, everything basically has pulled out of WNY.....  But anyways I am sure in today's economy it will be many years before the island is fully developed if ever.... living on a island can be a pain in the ass once you realize you need to boat over each and every time you want to do something on or off the island. That means is BAD weather as well as in good weather....I turned down a sweet deal on a private cottage on a island in Stoney Lake once I realized it was on a island..... been there, done that.  Bob"
349378,JohnF,2009-06-07 22:05:00,3494," Unless you and others who think that way can convince the gov't to buy it and turn it into a conservation or whatever. But there's a limit to the governement's ability to fund conservation of natural areas. If there's money to be made to help the region survive (taxes and jobs) and there's no compelling reason to stop development (environmental and ecological) then it will probably happen once the demand exceeds the cost for a developer. If you were a grocery store owner in the nearest community would you be wanting to stop this? Or if you ran a marina, or a hardware store, or were a builder ....  It's easy for us to watch at a distance and criticize but the real issue is what does it mean locally. We'd all love to see nature protected and preserved so we can enjoy it on our 2 week summer holidays but what about the folks who are toughing it out all year in that area you enjoy fleetingly? Don't you think they'd enjoy a bigger retail season to make the winter off-season easier to survive?  As the years go by and development and greed consumes our natural areas we're all gonna have to learn to go farther afield to enjoy nature.  Guys like Solo have got it figgered. They go far enuf that greed and avarice won't take away their playgrounds while they still can play. We all need to take a page from their books cuz greed and avarice wait for no man.  Dayum! I'm in a negatively philosophical mood today. Must be cuz I spent too much time out in the sun cleaning the pool and gardening. Also cuz I had a rather large deal take a left turn on me this week. I can be philosophical about nature but when my bank account takes a hit I get really really pizzed.  JF"
349580,Billy Bob,2009-06-08 12:40:00,5865,"Just like I posted yesterday about the do gooders in Buffalo they have rose up once AGAIN to kill moving forward with something, anything.........This time in Canada.  http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/696343.html"
349585,Banger68,2009-06-08 12:56:00,157,Is there still a cabin on the tiny island off the northeast corner of Boyd Island?

This is what happens when you put a price on things, when will they see that some things can not be sold. Build build build, when will it ever stop, is what we got not enough?  Oh look, life, lets kill it!  an old Cree saying goes,  ONLY AFTER THE LAST TREE HAS BEEN CUT DOWN, ONLY AFTER THE LAST RIVER HAS BEEN POISONED, ONLY AFTER THE LAST FISH HAS BEEN CAUGHT, ONLY THEN, WILL YOU FIND THAT MONEY CANNOT BE EATEN. CREE"
349722,solopaddler,2009-06-08 18:20:00,8605,  Have to say I find that saying pretty ironic. The Cree of northern Quebec sold their souls to Quebec Hydro so that several huge areas of their native territory could be flooded and hydro-electric generators built. The environmental destruction engendered by these mega projects is so vast and far-reaching that even Hydro-Quebec spokespeople have admitted that the consequences are incalculable.
349976,Pigeontroller,2009-06-09 01:22:00,2793," Redrock, that cabin was rebuilt a few years back..."
350103,Banger68,2009-06-09 12:44:00,157, He might not be too happy about this.
350129,ehg,2009-06-09 13:34:00,2666," Family had a trailer at Tall Cedars for nearly 30 yrs. until it was sold and shutdown. Former Nortel executive bought it, split it into 3 lots, sold them and moved on.  Still fish Pigeon Lake in that area and have seen actually lighter fishing pressure there than the late 70's and 80's. Remember counting 87 boats fishing around Red Rock, Roetzels area in 1979 or so on summer Saturday night. Now lucky if there 5-10 boats fishing there at similar time. Musky seem to be as plentiful as ever. Seem to catch one everytime up there.  There has been talk of development of Boyd(Big) Island forever.  People are more into wakeboarding and jetskiing it seems, fishing is still good up that way. Not a disaster yet.  Busy up there on long weekends, lake is practically empty of traffic in May, June and Sept.-Nov."
