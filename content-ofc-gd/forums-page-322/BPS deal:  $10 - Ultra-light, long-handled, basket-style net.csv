The long handle allows me to tuck it under my arm, but the net is so light that one can handle the net with just 1 hand.  I am very surprised that it is only $10 vs the plethora of $40+ nets, that I had to pass along the deal info.  Bass Pro Shops®  Silver Series Landing Net $9.97 ~ 20” hoop~ 48” handle~ Fish friendly, rubberized conservation netting~ Shallow, flat bottom for easy release~Easy hook removal material~Corrosion resistant finish"
