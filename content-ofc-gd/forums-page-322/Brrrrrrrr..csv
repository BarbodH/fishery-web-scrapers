774181,gino,2013-03-17 14:33:00,400,"that's cold,man...  ...looks like one of the longest winter even here in southwestern ON...still good solid ice on most lakes. Hang on, Simon...spring is coming, eventually..."
774183,mr blizzard,2013-03-17 14:52:00,1589,"Simon, Simon, Simon.........this is when we can start bbqing again true but lol anyways.  I am gald your happy with it, as I think it is the best time of the year.  No mosquitoes,  blackflies etc, just clean cool fresh air.  BBQD a steak last night, windchill around -38ish, and then we were blessed with a fairly intense northern light show, doesn't get any better...........well unless it had been a laker on the grill  How much ice do you have on the lakes down there, 48 to 50 inches here,  gotta love it  Have a sled ride for me today and post some video, they are awesome.  Cheers John"
774185,grt1,2013-03-17 15:17:00,638,"just checked the weather forcast, they are calling for another 10-25 cm of snow tonight and again tomorrow, just gotta love this March Madness."
774189,Leecher,2013-03-17 15:48:00,7832,"You can keep that cold air up your way, ya hear     Snow storm coming thru the Valley tomorrow and hope it's the last one"
774191,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-17 16:11:00,10439,When I left the house to hit the ice yesterday morning it was -35 with -44 windchills. My helmet defogger was not working so I had to ride with the visor open. Had to stop a bunch of times to deice my face as my eyes kept freezing shut!!! Looks like spring is finally coming though and if the weather dudes are right we will see negative single digit temps next weekend.
774217,Jet,2013-03-17 19:08:00,364,Looking forward to ice reports in May!
774232,lew,2013-03-17 20:02:00,12766,"It's hard to figure what's gonna happen around my area.  The newspaper says we're gonna get 4 inches of snow tomorrow, and the weather network says there's a 40% chance we may get flurries."
774243,spincast,2013-03-17 21:17:00,3279,"You guys in the northern climes can keep that frigid stuff - Me - I liked today in the Parissiene tropics . It was plus 5 and sunny here today. Warm enough for the Starcraft to exit her cave   working in the sun getting her ready for spring service I was almost warm! Cant wait for troling the shallows of Lake O for some spring time Browns, followed by the return of lunker lakers and krazy kings!."
