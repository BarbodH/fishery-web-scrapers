773326,irishfield,2013-03-12 14:31:00,26272,"Would have put in FNews but can't start a topic there for some reason....  Well after many decades and many dollars spent treating the Aurora as a species of it's own, the MNR managed to find a biologist willing to call it just a Brook Trout wearing makeup! The Aurora is no longer eligible to be on the species at risk list.. and suspect all funding will stop for it's care and stocking as well.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@species/documents/research/stdprod_091136.pdf"
773329,nancur373,2013-03-12 14:39:00,1211,That blows. won't be long till they're consumed
773330,Terry,2013-03-12 14:48:00,14456,I still want to catch one  Before it's too late
773344,adempsey,2013-03-12 16:50:00,1498,"Do you have a copy of the COSEWIC report by chance?  Would like to see that.  edit: Lol, sorry!  I hadn't realized your second link was to that report."
773350,Musky or Specks,2013-03-12 17:22:00,2710,As long as Whirligig and Whitepine remain sanctuaries it really shouldn't have an impact other than no more stocking of the 10 lakes with non selfsustaining populations.
773368,torco,2013-03-12 18:35:00,656,and the march to barren wastelands continues....
773378,jedimaster,2013-03-12 19:30:00,3472,It won't be long before the Mad Max revolution begins.
773381,BillM,2013-03-12 19:36:00,17367,"I wonder how much $$$$ the MNR is going to save because of this..  Honestly, I'd rather catch brookies with the spots"
773394,glen,2013-03-12 20:54:00,2641,"""new genetic and breeding data indicate that the Aurora Trout is not genetically distinct from Brook Trout""  So all the people that thought they were catching something special were not."
773398,highdrifter,2013-03-12 21:15:00,2534,You prepping for doomsday too?! 
773400,kickingfrog,2013-03-12 22:13:00,8333,I don't know about torco but the guy I usually get my preppin' stuff from wasn't answering his phone today?
773406,Rod Caster,2013-03-12 22:38:00,5784,"There is not a lot of literature cited in the references. Seems like a quick conclusion, maybe more science is needed?.... still, as Brad said, as long as whirligig and whitepine are kept as sanctuaries I'm not overly alarmed at the change in status. I'd better get into Liberty in two years before they all die.  It was more exciting knowing they were genetically different."
773508,Nipfisher,2013-03-13 13:26:00,2449,"Is the ""fancy"" brook trout going to be open yearly in the other lakes like Liberty and Wyn?"
773515,TJQ,2013-03-13 13:57:00,7806,That sucks...
773577,Moosebunk,2013-03-13 18:07:00,3970,My buddy will be bummed.  Cool fish... but little fish... in a big world.
773607,Rod Caster,2013-03-13 21:20:00,5784,Nipfisher- I'm gonna guess they will keep them rotationally open for a while.
773609,irishfield,2013-03-13 21:23:00,26272,Amazing what you can learn by reading council meeting agendas.... stuff that hasn't been presented to the public for input!! Even TJ didn't have it on his Aurora site yet... but of course he's busy boiling sap! lol
773630,lhousesoccer,2013-03-13 22:33:00,442,"It was a genetic mutation of the brook trout.  Just like some wolves are black and some are grey.  The genetic mutation that cause these ""brook trout"" to appear without spots and that bright red colouration stayed and was perpetuated by natural reproduction between individuals possessing that same genetic trait in the local populations, until they began to decline, and humans intervened to try and ""save"" them.  The remaining populations today have gone through a severe genetic bottleneck, being founded from a very small original population when the recovery program was started through hatchery breeding.  They have almost no genetic variability, which is a large threat to the population in terms of the ability to reproduce in the wild, grow, and survive.  Adding some new genetic material from brook trout won't dilute what makes the Aurora Trout what it is.  There's alot of work that's gone into this, and I seriously doubt it's going to be abandoned.
