774539,mikdor,2013-03-19 14:08:00,109,I am going to try and built a light weight trailer for hauling my 12ft. aluminum into back lakes with my atv. Does anyone have such  thing or suggestions . Thanks Mike
774554,vance,2013-03-19 15:46:00,719,I have a trailer for doing exactly that but no boat yet.It is a simple square frame and the axle has 14 inches of clearance to the ground.I added removeable sides and ends so it can be used for a box trailer as well.Its a little wider than my atv and maybe just a tad to heavy but it will take some abuse without breaking.  vance
