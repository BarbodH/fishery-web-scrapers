774245,redpearl99,2013-03-17 21:18:00,259,it seems like Basspro's Power pro box comes in 100 yards rather than 150 yards.  Do you guys think 100 yards is enough for a baitcaster?  thanks
774248,BillM,2013-03-17 21:31:00,17367,More then enough.
774251,fishindevil,2013-03-17 21:38:00,6254,Ya for sure and it really depends on what you are doing with the setup is you are casting or what ?? Put about 30-40yarss of mono backing on the reel then put your braid on !!! But like u said depends on how big the reel is and what you are using it for ?? I do the same for most of my baitcasters as well and it also depends on what the pound of mono backer is too some of my reels have 30lb mono backer some have 20lb  hope this helps
774257,gaspumper,2013-03-17 22:26:00,393,"I was at Bass Pro Fri. and bought two spools of 20lb test power pro it was 150 yds per spool,also had the 300 yds spool."
774258,Dan668,2013-03-17 22:28:00,1120,"When i used to use braid i only put around 60 yards and with mono backing. No need to use the entire spool, gets expensive when filling a lot of reels"
774259,Cudz,2013-03-17 22:45:00,2652,I usually put like 50-60 yards of braid and the rest mono backing
774260,kickingfrog,2013-03-17 22:46:00,8333,"Yep, as long as you're not using it on a downrigger, or ridiculous loooong flatlineing. I usually get the bigger bulk spools for braids since I'm not as concerned with them sitting on the shelf at home for a while before putting them on my reels. Most of mine have 75 yards or so and I've never seen the mono backing. At 75 yards I can have a few irreversible professional overruns before the line has to be replaced."
774262,davey buoy,2013-03-17 22:58:00,5505,I load my baitcasters with about 100 yards of braid.This will usually last me two seasons anyways.
774263,redpearl99,2013-03-17 23:03:00,259,"thanks everyone, i guess ill buy the 100 power pro online price for $11:)"
774264,kickingfrog,2013-03-17 23:08:00,8333,Flip it around and it lasts twice as long.
774268,davey buoy,2013-03-17 23:20:00,5505,That's what I do as well!.
774323,kemper,2013-03-18 03:38:00,2232,"How far do you cast?  100 yards is plenty, unless you are casting for salmon or something..."
774324,redpearl99,2013-03-18 04:01:00,259,do i still need to put the tape on the reel if i use some mono backing ?
774328,BillM,2013-03-18 04:19:00,17367, No.
774339,musky_hunter,2013-03-18 12:49:00,328,Depends on the spool. With my pixy I can fill 75 - 50 yards depending on the line. Enough for the purpose I use it for.
774342,Harrison,2013-03-18 13:24:00,2202,"Quite a few variables including # test, size reel your using and technique.  However, if you never have a ""professional"" override or your gear won't fray braid (ie bad eyelit) or fish near zebra mussels - 50 yards is ok.  I normally use 1/4 spool backing with the balance braid.  Not uncommon if you fish cover to slice braid on a dock post or zebra covered rocks/stump/weed.  I usually peel a 'few"" yards off the spool while on the water due to the above, including the overrides  Good Luck."
774385,SirCranksalot,2013-03-18 17:35:00,3291,"I,likewise, use backing. But I put on a bit extra. I find that I get quite a few tangles that are impossible to undo. So 100 yds soon becomes 75."
774394,jedimaster,2013-03-18 18:23:00,3472,"Here is my tip of the day. if you want casting distance think about the friction. I spool my reels up with just enough line so that the line is just barely touching the top of the reel line guide. This usually means about half the spool is filled, but I have never needed more when bass fishing. When musky fishing thats a bit different. I fyou fill it up you line will have a big presure point when its its full. Go look at it and you will see."
