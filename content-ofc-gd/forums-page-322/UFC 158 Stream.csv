Not sure if I have it in me to go out to a bar tonight after last nights festivities, but at the same time can't miss GSP vs Diaz   Thanks!"

774092,Nipfisher,2013-03-16 23:09:00,2449,www.firstrowsports.eu   It has never let me down.
774099,206,2013-03-16 23:33:00,563,"unless i just have poor internet connection, i have yet to fine an HD quality stream....But at least i still get the fights!"
774127,ehg,2013-03-17 01:55:00,2666," Yup, that one works great once you close irritating ads and go full screen. Time to start watching!"
774128,atvaholic,2013-03-17 02:02:00,271,"Careful Guys, my Avast went crazy when I hit that site. Says its malware.."
774145,hotsky,2013-03-17 03:09:00,400,Yeah those sites look like may have AIDS. glad I have a Mac!
774147,BillM,2013-03-17 03:17:00,17367, You'll never find a HD stream unless you're paying for it.
774150,Jigger,2013-03-17 03:26:00,1237,"X2! Doesnt help the barrage of popups though. Condit fights up next, hope he pulls out a win. Hendricks has a sledgehammer in his glove. Getting pumped!"
774172,d_paluch,2013-03-17 13:52:00,343,"If you use chrome/firefox, get adblocker plus. Stops the popups for me!  Good fights last night! The Condit v. Hendricks was a battle. Typical GSP fight, I was expecting more of a battle between the two considering all of the hype leading to the fight, but still nice to see him with the belt  I was asking about an HD stream because I have watched LeafsTV games in HD before, so thought maybe somewhere there was an HD link. Guess not!  Thanks for the website Nipfisher!"
774177,ehg,2013-03-17 14:21:00,2666," I use Avast, Google Chrome etc...... and received no malware warnings or anything. Closed a few ads and went full screen and it streamed perfectly.  Anyways, some fights were great. Condit-Hendricks especially. GSP dominated by keeping it on the ground. Not spectacular but effective ."
774178,Terry,2013-03-17 14:23:00,14456,only a couple of good fights  GSP fights can be boring..he sticks to his plan to keep his title..............never fights to beat up his opponent anymore...
774182,Muskieman,2013-03-17 14:46:00,2472,"My neighbor Mitch Gagnon was on the fight card , he was injured during training so couldn't fight,  he'll win next time !"
774196,misfish,2013-03-17 16:31:00,29133,"Hendricks keeps calling for GSP. I dont think he knows how well he can dominate. Ya he has the power,but I dont see him beating GSP.  Jordan Mein,this kid has some tools.Looking forward to watching him again."
774197,woodenboater,2013-03-17 16:39:00,2277,"Hendricks should get MacDonald first. THEN whoever wins, fights Ellenberger for the crack at GSP. Dana would probably have nightmares if it ends up MacDonald vs GSP. Would like to see Diaz/Condit Part Deux as well, Condit takes this one."
774198,danbouck,2013-03-17 16:40:00,4380,First fight I've seen in years. Thanks for the link!
774408,Toronto_Angler,2013-03-18 20:05:00,698,Hey ur mitch's neighbour? He does his standup with my partner at our gym. Great fighter. He's going to come back stronger after this injury
774412,Muskieman,2013-03-18 20:35:00,2472,Small world eh ?
774414,misfish,2013-03-18 20:40:00,29133, X2
