774105,Tayzak15,2013-03-17 00:20:00,318,Recently Picked up a Lowrance Elits 5 dsi with gps built in and I was wondering what size battery you would recommend for it? send me links to some you can even find online if you can. Usually will have it running 10-14hrs per day when I'm out on the lake and I suppose even double that time for weekend camping trips. Nothing else will be connected to the battery just the finder. Also recommend any other accessories I would need or would be an advantage to have.  Thanks for your help in advance guys. Never owned a fishfinder with an external power source before

774118,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-17 01:32:00,10439,I just used the female spade connectors already present. My Elite 5 DSI came as a portable. I just replaced the D cell battery pack with the gel battery.

774563,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-19 16:32:00,10439,That'll work fine.
774577,Roy,2013-03-19 17:50:00,13728,You can probably find another battery for $30 or so and keep both charged. That way if you're ever out in the sticks for a long weekend you won't get stuck without a sonar.
