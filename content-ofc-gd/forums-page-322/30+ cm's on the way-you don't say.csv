774289,moxie,2013-03-18 01:24:00,1566,I'm just hoping you guys out east get the whole bleepin mess. I'm done with old man winter and his dirty tricks. Enough is enough already!!!!!

774297,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-18 01:59:00,10439,I'll take some of that if you want to send it my way.
774306,craigdritchie,2013-03-18 02:11:00,1586,Old Man Winetr can kiss my grits already. Bring on spring!
774340,Harrison,2013-03-18 13:13:00,2202,"Sorry all, it's my fault.  Last week I put all the snow shovels and toboggans in storage.  In addition, I got all my spring crappie and perch gear organized and put together."
774344,ecmilley,2013-03-18 13:37:00,2163,"fine with me, have a full tank in the sled, need to burn it off"
774345,mr blizzard,2013-03-18 13:37:00,1589," x2, never enough winter, ice and snow, even with the extension  on the auger had to put it down to the handles to break thru to soft water yesterday, And now my starter  arrived, sledding season is JUST begining, YAHOOOO !!!!  53 inches of the good stuff.  Summer is good for mosquitos, sandflies , blackflies and SWEATING"
774346,Rod Caster,2013-03-18 13:40:00,5784,I just got my sled up and running... Winter can last right up to the third week of may.
774348,Sinker,2013-03-18 13:52:00,8692,"Your better to take advantage of it while we have it, than to gripe about it. This is the best and safest ice we will have all season. A bit of snow will just clean things up nicely. I'm loving it!  s."
774352,Moosebunk,2013-03-18 14:30:00,3970,"Would rather winter BE HERE until the time spring arrives.  A month of transition is an eye sore and total bore.  Gimme -1C with snow and ice, or 20C, sun and open water.  Everything inbetween can go away. lol."
774358,Tootsie II,2013-03-18 15:02:00,162,"LOL, the last time this happened, people around here were getting ready to put a bounty on the head of that critter from Wiarton who called for a early Spring."
774369,blaque,2013-03-18 15:53:00,2419,This sums up my outlook on seasons perfectly
