Even if you do just that and take out on hwy 69 or Harris lake it's a fantastic trip, especially in the upper half.  We portaged north of the Mag not to island lake, but to some really phenominal smaller back lakes where we've camped and fished. All those little pothole lakes north of the Mag are teeming with big bass. It's just an awesome area.  Can't help you with Island lake info, but can steer you to some other spots if you're interested.  Cheers"

Installing GAF shingles with a 50 yr warranty and transferable to the next two homeowners is  huge plus. I no longer have to worry about a roof that leaks. I do plan on going up to Montreal/Cornwall this summer to stay with family and fish St'Louis again, St.Francis and Lake of Two Mountains for Muksies. All areas hold big fish. Beyond that probably a couple of weekend trips supporting the MCI outings. I think that I will concentrate all my fishing this summer to LSC firstly and I am going to hit Georgian bay too a few times this summer. The K's are nice but it is a real pain fighting the TO traffic at the end of the day. No so much when you are coming back from a successful day on LSC."

Sept is the ""big"" one. I fly into Cree lake in northern Saskatchewan for giant lakers and pike. July is the only wildcard still. I'm either taking the family to Quetico park for a canoe trip or doing another fly in out of Nakina. Depends on what my assignment is with the magazine.  Should be a fun year."

The lake also holds a healthy population of whitefish and perch, so we hope to have some whities to bring home for the smoker! With 7 Lakes Outfitters having the only camp on the lake, we're excited to enjoy the seclusion of the north and the fantastic fishing it has to offer.

I was in Algonquin at the wrong season for trout last year, but after hitting up the lakes I did, I'd suggest Hogan, Catfish and Cedar. Really beautiful, but tough portages. Rivers are amazing with otters and moose on the scene. Lakers will be biting in Hogan and Catfish for sure, Cedar has pickerel, muskie, whitefish, perch, bass (in the season of course), and Radiant right beside Cedar has specks, pickeral and whities too.
