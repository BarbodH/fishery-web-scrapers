773979,Rod Caster,2013-03-16 12:48:00,5784,I think it's great! Lots of episodes on the FAR north and very little product pushing or even talking for that matter haha. Easily my favorite fishing show on Global now.
773983,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-16 12:58:00,10439,Watch it all the time and have even been on it.
773984,Rod Caster,2013-03-16 13:17:00,5784,No kidding! That's really cool. What were you fishing for?
773992,fisherman7,2013-03-16 14:04:00,325,Every weekend!
773998,Moosebunk,2013-03-16 14:15:00,3970,Have always liked that show.  It is simply done and it inspires one to experience the north.
774008,mr blizzard,2013-03-16 15:04:00,1589,"Never saw it what day and time is it on, love to see it."
774024,Rich,2013-03-16 16:01:00,3927,Isnt it pretty well all hunting? Or am I thinking of a different show?
774090,Rod Caster,2013-03-16 22:53:00,5784,"I'm seen mostly fishing shows, but I remember seeing some arctic hunting too.  It played on Global at 830 (i think) this morning (saturday)."
774125,Tootsie II,2013-03-17 01:48:00,162,"I've only seen the fishing episodes though you can probably bet there are probably some goose hunting episodes. Question is, will Global Tv broadcast them. Wouldn't want to offend people's sensibilities about harvesting geese for sport. It sure beats that ""Fishful Thinking"" which now has so many commercials that I no longer watch it."
774167,Rod Caster,2013-03-17 13:24:00,5784,"Ya, I thought Global was cutting out all the outdoor shows... wonder if that is for next season?  I have a hard time sitting down and watching a full episode when guys are selling you motor oil or a million other things...this show is refreshing and very Canadian."
774176,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-17 14:11:00,10439, It was a laker show on Great Bear back in '96 or '97.
774199,troutologist,2013-03-17 16:41:00,951,"Steve has a lot of cool sites that he highlights in the show. One of the longest running outdoor shows right now. I get the opportunity to compare notes on arctic travel with him every so often...always a blast. Keep an eye out for some of the new shows, they are also on WildTv....might even see me uglying up the place."
774277,Rod Caster,2013-03-18 00:10:00,5784,"Sweet, Jay! Keep an eye out I will.... give a shout out to OFC if you can hahaha."
774349,bigbuck,2013-03-18 14:08:00,2449,It is simple and focuses more on the scenery and less on the fishing. Its a nice change and it showcases our far north quite nicely.
774353,Moosebunk,2013-03-18 14:37:00,3970,"Think that might have been one of the Great Slave Lake episodes I saw Dave.  It was one episode that Gary Roach was jiggin' up lakers on one of his Berkeley Lightning Sig Series Rods.  The reel he had on the rod was a green Abu Cardinal spinning reel with a rear drag and 8lb mono.  He caught a 22 and 28lb'er I believe they were, on the set-up.  I loved that because I had the same set-up, still do, and it has caught it's fair share of fish over the years.  I think Adventures North is heavily tied to Tourism Quebec... and for that reason you often get to see some great places in Ungava region too."
774365,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-18 15:30:00,10439,Yes Northern Quebec Tourism is their major sponsor. There are some great episodes from there for sure.
