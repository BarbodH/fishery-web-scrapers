But I'm not going to fly to Norway just to tie some flies, so I was thinking about hosting one around here. I know there's a pretty healthy population of fly fishers in Ontario and I'm trying to get a feel for what kind of a crowd it could draw. There would be 6 categories, streamers, nymphs, dries, most accurate, a mystery fly, and classic/decorative salmon flies. Flies would be judged on symmetry, cleanliness, creativity and accuracy (when compared to the real thing). If enough people are interested I think we could do it around September? Anyways, just getting a feel. Thanks!"

774174,Christopheraaron,2013-03-17 14:01:00,3525,"Haha, we could have a viewing area?"
774216,bowshep,2013-03-17 19:07:00,378,l am getting better at tying l am in. Even if its to show what l am doing or my own variation of.
774229,Christopheraaron,2013-03-17 19:51:00,3525," Good idea, we could videotape all the entries being tied and then sell a DVD of all the patterns at the end"
774240,dhickey,2013-03-17 20:47:00,1038,Why not showcase your tying skills rite here? Lets see some pics. Wooly buggers would be a good start.
774241,Christopheraaron,2013-03-17 20:58:00,3525,"LOL, don't worry you'll have them this week.  I just thought it would be fun for everyone interested in fly fishing to come out, learn and meet some other like minded individuals"
774256,dhickey,2013-03-17 22:21:00,1038,Im in..
774269,Jacob,2013-03-17 23:23:00,186,"I would definitely be interested, great idea!"
774271,Christopheraaron,2013-03-17 23:41:00,3525,"Looks like we have some interest  Any ideas on location? We'd want something pretty affordable, like a library or gym maybe, would also need some tables and needs to be someplace relatively easily accessible to people from the GTA and Niagara."
