I know she is a smart girl and has always pulled in top marks rite from kindergarden but wow. She loves the outdoors and is almost allways out there with me whether its camping on long weekends or fishing simcoe on the ice. I think there is somthing to be said about letting kids learn about nature at a young age. My son is 19 now and going to ryerson and has a job as well as coaches football..  Proud Dad  You BETT.
