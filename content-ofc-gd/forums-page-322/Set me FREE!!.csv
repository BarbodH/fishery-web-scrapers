As much as it pains me to let this one go, open waters will soon lead the way to new challenges. What better way to celebrate this harsh but glorious winter but with a “Big Old Mix Tape”.  With no further adieu...      We had the honour to fish with an excellent bunch of skilled icers. Wish we could have been out with more, but time is so little and more seasons shall come. Early morning walleyes, complimented with pike setting fire to the tip ups, followed by after noon jumbo perch and slab crappy delights...ripping through the water columns chasing lake trout. We had it all.  Victory at times came with a cost but no giant is for free and perhaps we still carry the consequences but experience has shown that there is always light at the end for those who pursue and endure. The combination of day trips and local scouting missions quickly became a weekly exercise, surely there was no shortage of opportunities waiting to be ceased.  There are no favourite seasons and we are always excited for the one to come.  Winters in Ontario can be unpredictable at best but one thing you can be sure of is that mother nature doesn't care for days off work. She is as cruel as she is beautiful.  For us, every minute counts and this is a time for great adventure. The hardship is as much part of the experience as the success.  Take it or lea-- ...wait a minute is this a trick question?  There are no excuses needed as 3 am often comes too soon, little sleep willingly traded quickly for the promise of adventure. Going through minus 35 C without windchill, and no shelter, to the days of basking in the sun with a light sweater on, no chance is left to waste.  Fueled by the prospect of elusive beasts, menacing and powerful, under freezing conditions and most vulnerable to the elements with a possible chance for great tragedy, no questions asked. Well...  Yes Sir, Of course Sir  Nature is at its best when she is raw and intense, bigger than yourself. The challenge is only met by its rewards.  Times get tough, the tough go ice fishing...  Spring is approaching fast, which means high anticipations at Bassassins' headquarters. Pike spawn, steel-head runs, big carp and gar in May, small mouth and musky all summer long, chunky fall walleyes and first ice. Its a perfect loop.  Stay tuned  Tight Lines  Bass & Smooth"
