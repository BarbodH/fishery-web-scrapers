773864,ccmtcanada,2013-03-15 19:49:00,7971,Broken link for me....can't see it....  Edit:  Wow!  That would be scary!! (tried loading it again and it worked)
773865,vance,2013-03-15 19:51:00,719,"Well it does say LETS GO PLACES on the side of his boat,he just didnt get too far."
773866,kickingfrog,2013-03-15 19:52:00,8333,That'll buff right out.
773871,lew,2013-03-15 20:05:00,12766,"He's buried pretty deep in the bushes so he musta been going fairly fast, lucky they weren't tossed outta the boat."
773874,Fisherman,2013-03-15 20:17:00,7201,Well just a look at the loogans smile would seem to set the level of caring for the equipment.  Not much more than kids driving a rocket.
773879,SirCranksalot,2013-03-15 20:30:00,3291,Yahoos in training!!
773881,kickingfrog,2013-03-15 20:30:00,8333,"In all fairness that might also be a look of holly bleep ""look what happened... and we don't have a scratch."""
773882,fishnsled,2013-03-15 20:32:00,3520,"Michael Iaconelli.  Certainly not a kid or for that matter a lack of experience being he's been professionally doing this since the mid 90's.  Running down the lake and hit something and lost control, could happen to anyone.  Yes, he is probably not as worried about it given that he looks OK. (Or the holy bleep ""look what happened... and we don't have a scratch."")   And the fact his sponsors will have another boat waiting at dock when he gets back."
773883,pidge,2013-03-15 20:44:00,438,I think we've all thought about that happening before and how luck you'd be to be alive. Wasn't there time. Scary for sure.
773894,SirWhite,2013-03-15 21:51:00,210,"Looks like that new ""RealTree"" trailer is camo'd well. Not sure why it's needed but........."
773899,Joey,2013-03-15 22:02:00,9122,"Wow, scary stuff.  Glad they made out okay!"
773907,mr blizzard,2013-03-15 22:52:00,1589,"Naw .......they were just auditioning for  SWAMP PEOPLE,,,,,,,,,,damn gator got away again"
773908,misfish,2013-03-15 23:04:00,29133,  I was thinking the same thing about 3 hours ago.LOL
773909,mr blizzard,2013-03-15 23:04:00,1589," Oh come on someone, I finally made a funny  on the board"
773910,mr blizzard,2013-03-15 23:08:00,1589,Thanks  Misfish   great minds think alike.
773943,woodenboater,2013-03-16 02:45:00,2277,"That could have gone so wrong in so many ways, they're damn lucky. Would like to see wider photos of the water they were in, I mean that stuff is murky. and looking at the general vegetation, I'm not surprised it's deadhead central."
773974,206,2013-03-16 12:16:00,563," Looks like a narrows, scroll threw these pics of ""eye witness""  http://www.bassmaster.com/slideshow/ikes-crash-landing  at least he slowed down to pass this boat, I don't think he's a hooligan but there is tremendous pressure on these guys to preform"
