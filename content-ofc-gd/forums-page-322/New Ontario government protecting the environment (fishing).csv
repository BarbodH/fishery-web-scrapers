Liberal or not these fools do not deserve the posts they hold nor do they know how the real world works. Our world. I'm not really sure a few more smolts in a stream is gonna make the real issues go away but have at er'."
774309,BillM,2013-03-18 02:27:00,17367,"No one can actually think this is good for the fishery...  It's absolute insanity if you ask me.  Efforts of so many, destroyed by a few..   It's disgusting."
774312,mcdougy,2013-03-18 02:37:00,274,"SO if You hate the government and think local groups are a joke, who do you think will look after things?  Or is it some people like to cry and yell ABOUT EVERYTHING and still do nothing."
774320,chessy,2013-03-18 03:11:00,610,"If your comment is directed at me  yes my government is a joke and most groups are a joke they are only there for the MONEY . I yell and cry and have over 34 years of helping on my local river, and the most i have received is a thank you and a slice of pizza once a year. If memory serves me correctly the ofah took over a hatchery and charged the group 2 dollars a bag of fish food for the handling of it, can you believe that crap"
774321,mcdougy,2013-03-18 03:31:00,274,"Not at you or I would have quoted you. I appreciate all you do for the interest of sport fishing and water preservation. I also have never gained a penny ever, it actually costs me.  The groups I join are never pocketing money like you speak of, to my knowledge. All money goes directly into the hatchery. You must know the expenses of these type of things also. It takes alot.  I truly do not get into many political conversations.  My original post is how and will feel.  In this exact program, I feel it is a good thing to give some of the tax money to a not for profit hatchery, in the intentions they will use it to buy needed equipment, pay the hydro, buy the food, pay the property tax.............. and so on.Trying to preserve maintain or improve any body of water.    The ironic part is, people who think hatcherys are joke better not ever look at stats for stocking to pick a body of water to fish, because that right there would be a joke.   I came here to meet people and make possible friends, not argue and fight. i do not see the point of that."
774326,Twocoda,2013-03-18 04:15:00,4130,well our only other option is to farm fish ...if we want to keep on eating them....but then ....we know what hazzards thats going to bring ....my point is ...the decades of research you have read are infractions set by us non native fishermen....Honestly the general feel i get from the natives is positive to repair and thrive together with an upper hand to Gov Bull that they keep omnibusing in to law
774331,misfish,2013-03-18 09:37:00,29133," I didnt mean pay the volunteers,I meant for it to mean,they will give money to the groups that are volunteering. I still dont see why they should put out of their own pocket. It,s should be 100% funded. Like I said before,volunteering is a great thing,just shouldnt be at a great cost.  Hope that made sense this time.LOL"

774206,mcdougy,2013-03-17 17:04:00,274,Sounds promising....always good to get some of our money back in our hands.
774207,Terry,2013-03-17 17:07:00,14456,when did we get a New Ontario government  was there an election I missed or did we finally over throw the goverment
774209,woodenboater,2013-03-17 17:27:00,2277,Ramping up for an election methinks  but still good news if it does mean more $ for hatcheries and protection. Now if they could find some coin for CO's....
774214,Sinker,2013-03-17 18:31:00,8692,Sounds like their passing resources off to me. They don't do squat as it is.  S.
774215,misfish,2013-03-17 18:43:00,29133, I see they are going to give money to those that are willing to VOLUNTEER. WRONG way of thinking IMO.  Not disrespecting those that do.
774218,BillM,2013-03-17 19:09:00,17367, Who else is looking after your favourite river?   We both know it's not the government
774219,Rich,2013-03-17 19:10:00,3927,"They've done a pretty good job restoring the lynn river in simcoe. Not the MNR that is, private OFAH funded groups, related to this initiative."
774222,misfish,2013-03-17 19:27:00,29133," Thats my point Bill. Others are putting out their time and own money.Volunteering is great, We pay to play,so get the resource back the way it should be. This to me,is a bunch of crap. Get more CO,S AND THE MNR,back to the way it is to be."
774226,BillM,2013-03-17 19:37:00,17367," I'd love to have more CO's patrolling the river...   We usually have the district MNR biologist out to a few of the Nottawasaga Steelheaders meetings.    He provides us the data from our scale sampling, etc..   Pretty interesting stuff."
774228,craigdritchie,2013-03-17 19:51:00,1586,"Isn't this the very same ""new"" Ontario government that just let the Indians set up gill nets from Goderich to Owen Sound?  Yes, I'm sure that initiative will go a long way toward protecting fisheries. Nothing like a few miles of gill nets to put more fish in the system.  Idiots."
774230,Christopheraaron,2013-03-17 19:57:00,3525,A volunteer group of people to cut nets?
774231,misfish,2013-03-17 19:58:00,29133," When/where, is the next meeting Bill?"
774233,BillM,2013-03-17 20:03:00,17367," 2nd Wednesday of every month..   New venue is in Bradford (Don Cherrys)...  You should come out, good group of guys."
774239,Fisherman,2013-03-17 20:24:00,7201,Exactly what Craig said.  Why is the revenue going to restock when it gets raped by another group that has questionable limits.
774244,misfish,2013-03-17 21:17:00,29133, Sounds good. Thanks.
774246,misfish,2013-03-17 21:19:00,29133,"Like I said Erich  Get more CO,S AND THE MNR,back to the way it is to be.Time to push back."
774266,SirCranksalot,2013-03-17 23:14:00,3291, I don't think anybody is suggesting that volunteers be paid. It's just that some money will presumable made avail for the volunteers to do projects.
774272,bigugli,2013-03-17 23:46:00,6138,"With the courts backing native fishing rights claims, it's not likely the province is negotiating from a position of strength"
774275,chessy,2013-03-17 23:59:00,610,"more money going to organizations to deliver these project, at what cost. Most organizations pay high rates to manage money given to them by governments to pad there bottom line.  why spend one nickle on protection of fish and wild life as the MNR does not give a rats ass about some species of fish . I know of 3 phone calls to tips line on poaching rainbow trout that have never been called back but 1 call on taking a walley from rice lake was called back in less than 24 hours of the call being made, both occurrences came from the sam WMU so its not one officer is busy its the same guy. This is just another way to make non profit organizations vote on there behalf in the next ellection and yes i am talking trash fully on the OFAH"
774291,Twocoda,2013-03-18 01:28:00,4130," Your not looking at the big picture Craig...I am very optimistic now that SON has control over the water we will see change for positive outcomes to balance the fish back to a natural state,,,,All the natives i have talked to are excited about volunteering to existing hatcheries to learn the process with the possibilities of being the custodians of their own hatchery as they move forward to the future...Since the natives took over their right to fish on lake Huron there has not been one charge layed from going over quota..too bad we couldnt say same when we were the commercial fishers...as far as the new regulations in Colpoys and OS the nets may be eaiser visable by their location but it doesnt change the quota so the nets shouldnt be out there as long ... Im confident Syndenham and  Saugeen Nation will seize this opportunity to work together to remove nets during derby times Thats a false assumption ...the resource has already been raped....now its time to heal the damage..stocking hatcheries are in dire straits with the dropping participation of derbys....The opportunities are greater now for the Gov to actually work with SON and benefit us all"
774292,Jon,2013-03-18 01:33:00,209,"Without knowing the details, this appears to be good news. Some of you may have heard that MNR recently cancelled the Community Fish and Wildlife Involvement Program (CFWIP) but I don't recall seeing any press releases on this (surprise, surprise). I am assuming that this new program just replaces CFWIP, with some modifications. CFWIP had a budget of $1,000,000 annually and each District reviewed projects within the District. In my experience, projects were typically funded in the neighbourhood of around $1500. This new program appears to be co-ordinated out of Peterborough and after a very quick check, I didn't see how much is alotted for the new program. It has also increased the amount of funding to up to $20,000. Based on this amount, I am assuming that fewer projects will be funded, however, more substantial projects can be funded.  Jon"
774295,moxie,2013-03-18 01:40:00,1566,"For starters, no one elected whats her face so this government should mean even less to us than the one led by McGumby Dammit!! Secondly,  its just another way of throwing away more of our hard earned money (see any other Liberal Scandal). These Jackasses haven't to been able to find their own asses with both hands for 9 years and in doing so have downloaded Tonnes of debt onto any future Grandchildren my offspring might bless me with some day so what makes anyone think they're gonna start figuring it out now??????? Dreaming in technicolor folks.   Another Stewardship group??? Just keep in mind the Stewardship Gestapo that was stealing from us at the cash tills with that environmental fee crap. Did that change anything and what bottomless pit did that cash end up being thrown down? How does it go again,  If someone puts lipstick on a Pig would you be stupid enough to kiss it mistaking it for something else????? Whatever. Throw her and the rest of her cronies out and leave them pension less and homeless cause we'll be joining them soon enough if this continues. There's extra money???? PAY SOME DEBTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the hell is wrong with everyone?!?!?!    Five simple words; STOP BUYING VOTES AND GOVERN!!!!"
774303,mcdougy,2013-03-18 02:07:00,274,"Well, there ya go, Hope you feel better since you got that out!!  I'm wondering if you have ever been involved with any grass roots  volunteer hatchery, or similar?  From my experience on 4 different type organizations, I know how much time and effort and MONEY it takes to do this stuff. I agree with some other comments on hiring some more C.O's, but a thousand or two, to a couple hundred local clubs WILL and DOES make a difference.  But Maybe your right, Lets ALL pay for another election, and make sure those that are elected, are more pure than honey.  because that WILL HAPPEN, I can tell your sure of it. For Your record, I DO NOT vote liberal either."
774304,craigdritchie,2013-03-18 02:10:00,1586, What I'm looking at is several decades of historic experience. Fisheries rehab projects and gill nets have yet to make a good combo - in Ontario or anywhere else.
