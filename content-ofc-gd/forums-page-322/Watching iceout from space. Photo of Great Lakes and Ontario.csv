773962,fishindevil,2013-03-16 08:59:00,6254,Yes there is satellite pics every 12 hrs or so on coast watch that shows Ontario in pretty good detail as long as there isn't thick clouds !!!! Pretty cool that you can get that live from space !!! It also shows thermal temps of the Great Lakes !!!! Been using it for years !!! Someone will post the link I'm sure .... I'm on my iPhone and don't have it here... Thanks for sharing
