Are the marina's a good place? Is it the right time now that the ice is out? How about the Waterford ponds? Any help would be appreciated. From shore but could put a small boat in.

There's lots of channels to explore there but private property limits the shorefishing spots, bring a small boat for sure. If you drive through you'll see some spots on shore but get there early cuz locals are waiting for them, sometimes overnight I think.  I caught lotsa small crappies outta waterford but nothing over 9"".  My buddy caught a 13"", biggest I ever seen from those ponds.  Check the quarry out back for crappie, its deep and they move around so gotta get lucky.  I wouldn't keep the quarry crappie though.....just sayin  Good luck"
