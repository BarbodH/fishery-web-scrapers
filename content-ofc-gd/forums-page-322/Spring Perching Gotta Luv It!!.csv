774066,RickOnt,2013-03-16 20:20:00,669,"Not quite the warm No coat day But a LOT less windy than yesterday.  Headed out at Gilford.  The shoreline is broken up bigtime But doable, Once you are on the Ice the travel is about perfect!!  Started in the south end in 15 Ft,  LOTS of Fish but none in the bucket.  The water here is very murky Likely from all the runoff.  As I worked my way North the water cleared up and working a drop off I found what I was looking for!!        Everthing in the Box was catching Fish but the Big Girls were caught on the Buckshot and the Rap.   Still looking for that sunny,warm,no Hut, no jacket Day.   Rick"

774070,Joey,2013-03-16 20:34:00,9122,"Woohoo, great stuff.  Wonder how long the shoreline will be doable"
774074,RickOnt,2013-03-16 21:13:00,669,"Chris     Yes  Its gonna be good!!   Joey   Not sure!   The operators broke it up pretty good bringing in their Huts,  I am going to check out the end of 89, No open water there just a wall of ice that could likely be chopped down.  Rick"

774088,aplumma,2013-03-16 22:50:00,6896,Have you tried a silver buddy for Perch yet? They are the killer lure down here. I vertical jig them from a boat and they get the big ones from below the herd. Nice batch of fish for sure.   Art
