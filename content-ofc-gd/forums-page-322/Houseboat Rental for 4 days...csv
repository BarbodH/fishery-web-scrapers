774413,juan96,2013-03-18 20:36:00,23,Hello  I have plan to rent houseboat for 4 days on north Ontario area from July 15 - 18. I found some houseboat rental site but they have only weekly rental or almost $1600 for 4 days.  Anybody know good and cheap houseboat rental shop around $600 for 4 days?

774445,crappieperchhunter,2013-03-18 23:39:00,2582,The last Houseboating I did was almost 20 years ago and you couldn't get it for that price way back then. $600 for 4 days in peak season just isn't going to happen.
