774462,mbac31,2013-03-19 01:24:00,904,Hoping someone can help me here. Im looking for a not so bright mouldable strike indicator putty. I need it for very clear saltwater or very clear tidal water applications. I currently use scierras putty as i find it to be the best. I need a more dull one as i find the bright ones tend to spook the bigger sea trout. I am also using this on a salt water shooting head line so durability is a must. I might be over looking a company maybe from north america. I have to order this stuff currently from Europe.
774464,ChrisK,2013-03-19 01:46:00,2772,I use a product called Biostrike. Comes in a few different colors http://www.riverbum.com/Loon-Biostrike/

774512,mbac31,2013-03-19 10:53:00,904,Works fine for me. Im looking for a dark one that i can add a little dab of bright color as not to spook fish. Seems to be a non existant product.

774630,mbac31,2013-03-19 23:15:00,904,Ive been doing just that but it doesnt take new color very well.
774752,cuzza,2013-03-20 15:11:00,467,Why not use a small regular strike indicator and attack it with a drab coloured sharpie leaving just a spot of colour or do the same to one of those small styrofoam balls used for packaging or bean bags and thread it on the line if you need something really small?  I've used Biostrike and never managed to get to it to stay on for very long even around a knot.
