Sorry for the quality of this picture,but left my camera in the sleigh for about 8 hours in the cold. Couldn't get the lens to clear up even after hour with the heat on in the hut.Checked it now and it's working ok. Ended up with about 50 total for the day.Even the MNR officer stopped by to visit  "
