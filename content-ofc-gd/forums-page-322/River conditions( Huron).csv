I am looking to fish any Huron trib tomorrow in the Bruce area. I don't want to drive and hour or two only to find that river is full of ice and unfishable. I know the website for the river levels, just want to make sure the river is not full of ice.I am fishing alone if anybody wants to hook up shoot me a PM.  "
