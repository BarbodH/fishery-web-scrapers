772152,Rod Caster,2013-03-06 19:19:00,5784,no technology needed...except a camera of course  Cool video
772153,registerfly,2013-03-06 19:24:00,198,what noodle trout fishing??
772155,kemper,2013-03-06 19:39:00,2232,I'd love to see someone do that with my own eyes...
772195,Musky or Specks,2013-03-06 22:37:00,2710,Miro I've actually done this twice once with a steelhead and once with a brook trout.
772196,Rich,2013-03-06 22:44:00,3927,"Piff, I did it with a gar!"
772256,fishinmortician,2013-03-07 01:43:00,100,"I can barely walk 10 feet from the bank without spooking them, let alone jumping in and stirring up the water. Great video though"
772289,Joey,2013-03-07 02:51:00,9122,"Meh, did it with a whitefish in 80 FOW"
772316,young_one,2013-03-07 05:15:00,620,"Awesome video, thanks for sharing. Subscribed to his channel."
772354,mirogak,2013-03-07 14:10:00,387," If anyone on this board had done it, thought it would certainly be you or Mr. Borger ... I guess the reason why this is possible is because if they are in open water and they get spooked, they hide in these holes (their homes) and here they probably don't have much reason to be spooked, they already feel safe ???  And the quarters are probably so tight that they can't see much and if they do see or feel something, they think its other trout?  I think the guy in the video eludes to this point as well."
772369,SirCranksalot,2013-03-07 15:41:00,3291,"  That's nuttin. I caught a 6 ft shark once, still got the scars to prove it."
772405,craigdritchie,2013-03-07 20:13:00,1586,"Excellent. Too bad it's illegal, at least around here."
774139,atvaholic,2013-03-17 02:38:00,271, + 1. Especially Browns.
774152,Dabluz,2013-03-17 04:10:00,701,I've caught brook trout in a lake with my hands.  I released them because it's illegal to catch fish this way.  The fish that I have caught were caught at night in very shallow water.  I used a flashlight to spot the fish.  I didn't even have to get my feet in the water.
