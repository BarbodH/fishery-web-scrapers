774091,aplumma,2013-03-16 22:58:00,6896,Bernie I have always admired your skills working on mechanical items and I see it is from your ability to see things in a logical way. Good job on the shower it is a masterpiece of engineering.   Art

774382,fishnsled,2013-03-18 17:23:00,3520,"We got a foam seat G, don't push it...LOL!!  Looks like time well spent Bernie!  And thanks for not posting pictures of you actually using the shower...LOL!!"
774389,Harrison,2013-03-18 18:07:00,2202,"Awesome.  We do something similar at the hunt camp.  We built a sauna (best idea ever).  It has a wood stove in it with a big aluminun pot like the one you have on it.  Load it with rain water from the barrels and as it heats pump it thru a garden hose to a sprinkler head mounted off the side of the roof and woola,  Nothing beats it!"
774393,Headhunter,2013-03-18 18:22:00,5703,I bet Rubin would have loved that a couple of week ago! Well done Bernie... nothing can't be accomplished if you have the willingness to try! Did the shower help to get the curry smell out of the cottage!? LOL HH
774395,bigbuck,2013-03-18 18:25:00,2449,You will now officially be known as MacGyver. Nice to be able to clean up when you are roughing it.
774406,Big Cliff,2013-03-18 19:59:00,6899,"Anyone with a very high mechanical aptitude could have figured that out LOL! (naturally there will be those that say ""sure, it's a simple solution"".  Good on you Brenie, they say necessity is the mother of invention!  I always love it when I can take bits and pieces of something and turn them into a solution."
