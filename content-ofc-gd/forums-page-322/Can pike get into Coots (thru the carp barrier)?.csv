774310,hotsky,2013-03-18 02:30:00,400,Hoping to catch a few pike before the season closes in a couple of weeks. I've never fished for them pre spawn but heard it's a good time to get into some large ones. I tried the Harbour today for a few hours this afternoon but no luck. Coots seems like a good place for them to spawn but I wasn't sure of they can get thru the carp barrier.
774311,Garfisher,2013-03-18 02:36:00,229,"They'd be in Coots, the people who operate the barrier only send back the carp, everything else is allowed through"
774319,hammercarp,2013-03-18 03:07:00,964,The problem is that the barrier is only operated or checked  intermittently. There can be long periods when it is simply a barrier.
774387,pics,2013-03-18 17:40:00,1268,Is there even any water in coots??. It must be really low if there is....
774388,Marko,2013-03-18 18:02:00,854,Its usually really shallow in the spring. Last year i went there there were carp inside coots bay everywhere. Yes there are pike in as well. I watched those guys few times throw bass-pike in coots bay while carp and bows went back to the lake side. If i were you i would fish the mouth of the canal i really dont know that you have enough water in the bay
774421,hotsky,2013-03-18 21:41:00,400,"Thanks, yeah water was quite low in there, bearly any higher than it was in the summer. I was hoping the snow we had would help out a bit but I guess I didn't much."
