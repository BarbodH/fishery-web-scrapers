220373,icefisherman,2008-06-27 16:38:00,952,"Started at 5:30am this morning. Very slow day, seems for most everyone on the radio. I may have done better than most with 3 fish in the boat by 11am though...  First was 19 Lbs King on leadcore 10 colors out and watermelon NK28. Second one was 8Lbs Bow on HW flasher and green fly, followed by another bow(same size) on the other leadcore but only 5 colors out and with blue/silver/white NK28.... Tons of bait, some hooks but not very willing to bite...Did 100 to 200 fow, from 25 to 60 feet down. Forgot the camera so no pictures today. Nothing close in bite compared to last Friday. Oh well...if this weather gets settle once maybe we can start doing some normal fishing...it was COLD this morning, while the weatherman was calling for 29 degrees!?!? ;D  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
220483,bucktail,2008-06-27 23:35:00,1857,I went out of Oakville this morning as well and found the exact same results. 1 shaker chinook and a bow about 7 pounds. Only out for 2 hours and fished mostly from 150 to 200 feet. Water was very cold with inshore at 53 offshore at 56 . Guess the warmer water was blown down the lake with the fish.
