219976,modny,2008-06-26 19:57:00,502,"i've been there a bunch of times  imHO its no good  overfished, i never landed anything, spent alot of time there. its always REALLY windy too..  if u are going that way, just go to mountsberg. its like1 5 mins up the road. bigger fish, less people"
219991,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-26 20:37:00,2585,have not been there in a few years but used to get alot fo largies in that little lake there.  if the fishing has gone down hill then obviously the no spring fishing failed.  Cheers!
219993,danbouck,2008-06-26 21:06:00,4380,They have closed fishing this year until bass opening (this Saturday) to help from all the pressure.
220031,BITEME,2008-06-26 22:13:00,1969,DONT WASTE VALUABLE FISHING TIME ITS NOT WORTH IT
220035,pokerdemon4,2008-06-26 22:23:00,135,Ive caught some nice bass there pitching in the weeds.  I thought it was a great place.  You need to put your time in thats all.  There are some big largies there.  You just need to find them.  Cheers.  Thanks for all the info guys.
220054,Mattones,2008-06-26 23:04:00,587,I actually called today. Yes fishing is open.  I was going to head out there this weekend and rewnt a row boat..Then i figured Its kind of hard with just me doing it.
220067,misfish,2008-06-26 23:41:00,29133," Dan, this is not a personal attack on you,cuz you posted this,but looking at yer sig,this to me is what needs to happen on these smaller inland lakes.  "
220126,Rich,2008-06-27 01:27:00,3927,"Yup, nothing there. Nothing at all."
220139,2kj,2008-06-27 01:37:00,77,"I was fishing with a friend out of a canoe and we were not getting any action when he decided for a joke to put on  a 10 inch flipping worm.  Well if the saying big baits catch big has any truth it did this day, he hooked into and landed the biggest largemouth I have ever seen and we are bass guys who have seen plenty of 4s and 5s, this was 7 pounds 1 ounce, measured on a rapala scale.  He thought he snagged something until we saw it come out the weeds.  Only fish caught but who cares.  What a memory!"
220153,Mattones,2008-06-27 01:57:00,587,  haha awesome! i may be heading there this weekend for a few hours.
