219658,danc,2008-06-25 23:44:00,4677,The mods had a meeting and you're banned for life from the chat room Tom. Nobody informed you??
219660,Nanook,2008-06-25 23:52:00,565,"Cant help ya there Tom. But I downloaded it and got a new "" Office "" I get locked out of Chat occasionally, for no reason I know of, and its OK next day!!  Oh boy !! Time to try it again..............duh !"

219662,misfish,2008-06-25 23:56:00,29133,"Join the club. It would seem those of us that do not post fishing reports, are on the black list of ""OFC"". I for one, am going to try and get back on track."
219663,JohnF,2008-06-25 23:57:00,3494," Works fine for me, on Vista  JF"
219667,danc,2008-06-26 00:13:00,4677, I really have no idea what the problem might be Thomas. I'm sure somebody will help you though.

Recent updates with Vista, and my old pc crapping out on me ""AGAIN"", guess I will just have to work through it.   Chat with ya's in a couple of weeks,"
219687,Greencoachdog,2008-06-26 00:56:00,8163,"Check for Vista updates Tom, I had the same problem when first using Vista.  Did you restart your puter after loading the Java?"
219693,Clampet,2008-06-26 01:02:00,1947,Some insight on Vista: Click Here
219703,tjsa,2008-06-26 01:26:00,1578," Yup, complete shutdown and restart, still no go for the chat room.  Yak with you later..............maybe much later!!!!!!!!!!!!"
220254,tjsa,2008-06-27 11:52:00,1578," Problem solved. I had multiple updates of Java and my computer was pointing to an older version and trying to reconcile other versions and updates. Uninstalled all of them, went to the chat room, downloaded Java again, and all is well.  So.................I can participate in chat again................is this a good thing or not??????????"
220260,Greencoachdog,2008-06-27 12:04:00,8163,  Sounds like you're a glutton for punishment to me.
220263,tjsa,2008-06-27 12:14:00,1578," I can handle it, I got's a thick skull, and a lily white skin color, I figure I have the advantage."
