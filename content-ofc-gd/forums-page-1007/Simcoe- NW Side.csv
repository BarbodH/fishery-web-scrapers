Anyone have experience in that area, I've fished off JP and all along the SW section of Simcoe but never been to the north side. Boats small, 16.5' so were limited by weather....how is the fishing in Carthew Bay itself?  Any lakers/whitefish fishing up that way....look for a flotilla? Not looking for anyones secrets, but if there's good bass fishing off 8 mile shoal, its good in the bay or whatever pointers would be helpful.  Two younger kids so doubt we'll make a run to Willow beach etc, last time on Simcoe I got tossed around pretty good."
220437,richyb,2008-06-27 19:53:00,774,Hey ...  I havent had much luck in the bay itself ... I have got lots of nice smallmouth along the shore from the mouth of the bay to the 12th line.  If you go around the point in the bay from there to orillia is always decent for bass also ..   I havent fished lakers or whities in that area durring the summer tho so i cant help with that ...  Good luck
