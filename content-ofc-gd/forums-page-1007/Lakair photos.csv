218854,Moosebunk,2008-06-24 03:07:00,3970,Yep!!! Checked these earlier too.  Great shots KickinF.
219189,Greencoachdog,2008-06-25 00:03:00,8163,"It was great meeting you too Rob!!!  Beautiful pics!!!  ...I'll be bringing my tripod up next year, it seems that some of my pics came out as though the camera was ""teetering""... I can't imagine why?  ... and the ""fitting in"" as others have mentioned is right on the button... you may want to seek counseling for that eh?"
219194,Marty,2008-06-25 00:12:00,873,"Nicely done Rob.    Gotta say tho, you don't look much like your avatar.   Thanks for the great report and it was great to meet you."
219229,Mike the Pike,2008-06-25 01:17:00,3421,Excellent report and photos!!!!!!!!!  Love the shot of the doc at night with the green tint to it.  Also those purple sunsets just spectacular
219262,kickingfrog,2008-06-25 02:03:00,8333," Funny, most of my photos of you came out blurry too."
219264,kickingfrog,2008-06-25 02:04:00,8333, Neither do you.
219266,Beans,2008-06-25 02:09:00,3339,  Must have had sumpin' to do with that snazzy blueish rainsuit he was wearing...
220096,Rich Clemens,2008-06-27 00:53:00,3131,You got some amazing shots there.  Pleasure meeting you this year.
218417,kickingfrog,2008-06-23 14:55:00,8333,"First time for me at Lakair and with the exception of one, I had not met anybody else there in person. Board names, given names, avatar photos its a bit of a blur.  Loaded up and ready to go    Almost there     Went out for a paddle as soon as I got there   Think this guy knows the other place around the bend has a bigger one on his boat house???   I even had time to fish   Lots of people, many like me, with a board name and a given name   Night time at the dock   Bedtime after the campfire. (the campfire photos will be up for auction soon)   5 am and it's time to fish (after a couple of photos)     Lakair from the water    A nice little spot with deep water and a little current... and some fish    From the cast of characters. GCD kept his shirt on the whole weekend.(Roy too)    Gearing-up for the pike tourney     Group shot (and a testament to the dock's strength)   The big fish of the day... the pike not the angler     TJ fish jugglin'      One of our southern friends and his jet boat   Irishfeild thought I needed a shower???   Beans' shirt. There was not much of the former but a lot of the latter.   The prize table with the King and Queen presiding over their court.   First Canadian fishing trip for the Spawn of the Spawn of ED   Betcha he comes back   Ed, Spawn of, and Spawn of Spawn of   The winner   Series of sun set shots (that little dot of light is Bly and Cliff)   Bly and Cliff comin' in       Sitin' around the fire     Great time. Great people. Thanks to all. "
