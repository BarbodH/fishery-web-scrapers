219864,Fang,2008-06-26 15:39:00,1330,As promised from my trip report here's my buddies big trout    and his big pike  
219869,Pachone,2008-06-26 15:53:00,276,unbelievable!!!! that is one big trout !! what was it caught on?
219871,anders,2008-06-26 15:57:00,1168,"That Laker is worth the trip right there! Awsome fish....the size of the head is actually quite impressive.  Almost looks like its too big for the body, which is scary.  Definitly a sexy fish!"
219875,Fang,2008-06-26 16:10:00,1330,"Caught on a 5"" frozen herring in a Rhys Davis Super Herring rig. Just like fishing meat for Salmon on Lake Ontario.  We ran with a 1 1/2 oz weight in front of the bait and back 80-100 feet behind offshore planer boards. Trolling in 20-25 feet of water."
219878,limeyangler,2008-06-26 16:13:00,5204,Very impressive Laker.....where is Big Sand Lake?.....lol

219883,Fisherman,2008-06-26 16:21:00,7201,"Not to qestion Ontarios quality/quantity of fish, but Manitobas more northerly lakes are definitely worth the trip. I made two trips to Clearwater Lake east of The Pas in June 93 and 94, it is nothing to catch 50+ lakers a day and pike till your arms fall off.  You fish from sun up to sundown, 0400 to 2200, doesn't leave much time for sleep."
219885,johnnyb,2008-06-26 16:23:00,3413,WWWWOOOOWWWWW....those are some nice fish!
219889,jwl,2008-06-26 16:30:00,1056,"wicked nice fish man, you can see by the pic that the laker still has to grow into itself"

220206,Cudz,2008-06-27 03:35:00,2652,That is too funny about fishing clearwater lake in the Pas.  I too fished it in June of 93 or 94.  Good pike. Never fished for lakers.
