220379,lew,2008-06-27 16:59:00,12767,"  Thanks Ernie, I'll be heading up the 115 in a couple hours but I filled up yesterday in Toronto for $1.31 in anticipation of the increase for the long week-end......who'd have ever thought $1.31 was a bargain  That Petro-Canada just above the 401 is ALWAYS the most expensive on the 115 and I'd push my truck past him rather than buy his gas at the rip-off price he always charges. Guess he figures he's the 1st station on the hiway and folks will stop there not knowing their getting the shaft.  The cheapest on the 115 is ALWAYS the ESSO in the south bound lanes at the bottom of the hill just south of the 35 cut-off.  I filled up in North Bay last week for $139.9  Hate to think what the marinas are charging......."
220386,cranks bait,2008-06-27 17:25:00,721,"I filled up Thursday.  I said once it gets below 130, I'm getting it while it's cheap    129.9 is what I paid.  Truck and boat are full.  I'll go through a tank in the truck, but not much in the boat.  I figure I'll spend about the same or less than last year because of the more fuel efficiant motor.  As for the marinas, I live at one and I remember seeing 140 plus a few weeks ago.  I gerry can my fuel, as I do not need to fill up dockside.  I just do it after they leave so I don't rub it in their face."
220394,modny,2008-06-27 17:41:00,502,last year at this time prices were $1.02
220409,Kirk,2008-06-27 18:11:00,347,"I remember way back when, gas was 39.9 and 40 cents was the bra burning, nutmeg protest limit, long weekends the price would jog up to 42.9 and people would be outraged, conspiracy theories bla bla bla.  Its an easy news story, gets lots of hype, NDP and Liberal ragfest."
220533,Nanook,2008-06-28 02:54:00,565,$1:26 at the Indian Reserve just west of Buckhorn   Was busy as Hades today
220546,bullybass,2008-06-28 03:56:00,144,Weird.... went to Cobourg beach last night with the kids and it was $1.22 at the ultramar... had to fill up... across the street it was $1.32... how could I not fill up?? I can't believe it has come to where I think that $1.22 is cheap!!! what the hell is wrong with me
