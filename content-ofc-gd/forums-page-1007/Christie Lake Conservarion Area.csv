Has anyone been fishing here before with family or friends? If so, any tips on where to fish?  and if there are other good spots to take her fishing, please let me know  Any help would be awesome  thanks"

The ponds used to be stocked with decent brookies and rainbows but now it's only rainbows and some pretty tiny ones at that. You'll find the first 7 of the 9 ponds are the only ones worth fishing in with ponds 4, 5, 6 and 7 offering shady areas to avoid the sun. The lake has pike and largemouth bass though I've personally never fished it.  Light line under a bobber will do fine, try worms, corn or salmon eggs."

Fished it a couple years ago and caught nothing in 4 hours, then some workers from the conservation area pointed us towards Valens after informing us about them draining the lake annually."
