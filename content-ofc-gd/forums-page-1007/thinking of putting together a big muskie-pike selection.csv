They're one of my favorite trolling baits, (bumblebee) they also work well as a crankbait but they also make an excellent top water bait, specially after dark when cranked very slowly over top of a weed bed.  They've got rattles in them which work well in some instances, like after dark or in dirty water, but I like to remove the rattles on some of them to make them more of a silent bait and just let the natural vibration of the bait do it's thing.  Different strokes for different fish."
