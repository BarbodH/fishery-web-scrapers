220189,superior steel,2008-06-27 02:39:00,1,"All you tournament buffs out there should have done the rounds with various brands of fluorocarbon as a main line....I have tried Vanish and Vanish transition in 8lb, on spinning reels, and found it to handle like wire.  Any suggestions for a supple fluoro to use as a main line?  Thanks!"
220196,duber,2008-06-27 02:53:00,220,I've been using the new Trilene 100% Flourocarbon.  Seems pretty good so far but I ain't no pro!
220198,pokerdemon4,2008-06-27 02:56:00,135,Use braid and tie on a fluoro leader.  I gave up trying to use fluoro as a main line.  Braid rules.  No memory.
220209,fishnpro,2008-06-27 03:46:00,93,Its hard to say what fluoro is the best but I use P-Line Halo 10lb test and I like it alot but I am considering going to the 8lb.  -Fishnpro

220217,philly86,2008-06-27 04:21:00,10,"i agree with the p line flouro clear its solid, i've never had problems with it"
220227,huntervasili,2008-06-27 06:42:00,1604,Seaguar also makes an awesome fluoro. I have used it on a reel before and use it almost exclusively for leader and tippet material.
