The whole G2G was very well organized. T.J you the man! :clapping. This was the first time wifey and I got involved in a group G2G and it wont be our last.I want to give a special thanks to Spiel for cleaning that monster for me. I went out Fishing sunday at 5 pm for some walleye and i hook into this monster pike. It measured 38 inches without folding the tail fins. This thing went twice under the boat and took some line.I love the sound of the drag .When i finally got a look at what i had i almost sh,..;t. I coudnt see my lure and i didnt have a leader on.just fishing line comeing out of his mouth. The wife did a great job with the net. When she finally got it in the net she couldnt lift it into the boat,I quickly droped my rod and grabed the handle and hoised her in.  I will try later to post some pictures. Thanks to all again for a great time."

220092,Rich Clemens,2008-06-27 00:46:00,3131,"I add too that it was great meeting the two of you.  Yes - we did see a very nice pike lying the in the cleaning hut.  Congrats on that one.   Must be a first for bringing the wives along.  Brought mine this year and she really had a great time.   Myself, I met a number of new OFC'rs and renewed the friendships I made last year.  Truly a great time with even greater people."
