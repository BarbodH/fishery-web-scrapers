220382,wallyboss,2008-06-27 17:15:00,1095,Thanks for check the Fishing Limit inquiry thread and responding!!!  I felt I was getting a bad rap and just wanted to clear the air. I am also a catch and release guy. Except for a couple of walleye or crappy feed per year. I was only trying to help the guy have a good fishfry.  i am happy we are on the same page now.
220392,jwl,2008-06-27 17:35:00,1056,"don't get your panties all in a bunch now,   I just had the chance to check it out and I responded as soon as I saw the post and PM soon as I got back from running some errands before heading out on a couple day fishing trip to my camp, and appologized openly on the board to you and so everyone could see. I can admit to being in the wrong or taking somehting out of context no prob..even in front of the 3000 members of this board  We all know it's easy to misread something on a fishing board, and tonnes of people on here have probably responded in haste to something...I don't say nothin on the fishing forum I would not talk to you about face to face..I don't hide behind the keyboard.  Those who know me, know that about me, and that I am really not some kind of crap disturber just for my own personal entertainment for the day.  I have quite a few direct MNR contacts from being a trustee on the exec committee of a conservation club, and from volunteering the last couple years on a walleye enhancement project, I got no problem at all trying to get info from them and sharing.  Thanks for taking the time to do so in the other thread"
