220261,Gerritt,2008-06-27 12:07:00,6129,  So does this make me the new Number 1?  Congrats on the weight lose! Light Beer really does work eh?  G
220268,tjsa,2008-06-27 12:26:00,1578,"light beer helps, but less intake works much better.  I still haven't worked that last part out myself yet though,"
220299,LeXXington,2008-06-27 13:35:00,1928,"LOL, a problem true to my heart.  I have the 151 All sport.  Get the Hydro fin it really helps planing and will stop the hull slapping in larger waves.  You need to be above 13knots to get a plane going at top speed with the 25 you should be around 20-22 knots depending on waves, wind etc.  I added a second trolling motor battery up front too give me a little more weight near the front.  2 people on the boat is great to get a plane going but your not going to be able to reduce speed too much, 50% power will drop you below plane speed  3 people on the boat without the hydro fin, you need to balance people. yes move them all around the middle or close to the front. Then its WOT, start slowing down and you lose the plane.  4 people.. never going to happen  unless they all are on diets and small  With the 25 (4) I almost never allow more than 3 just due too the planing issue.. I would not worry about the WOT at all the 25 hardly uses any gas at all. I am normally  WOT or crusing not on a plane.  Too get on a plane put the motor down all the way and as you increase speed gently thumb the motor up. Once on a plane thumb the motor up until its at the max. Then you are going as fast as you can  When 3 people are on the boat.. a thumb click wait till speed increases, a thumb click etc.. do fast and you lose it.  25 is underpowered but for me most of the time Its me and a friend and only on rare occasions is it 3 people 4 people only when there is no other option.  Can't beat the trolling all day and it cost $$6-8 in gas"
220326,allbusiness,2008-06-27 14:19:00,23,"Thanks for all the posts guys  I'll screw around with it a little more today, as for the hydro foil I don't think I could bring myself to drill holes in a brand new motor - maybe in a couple of years when it isn't new I'll throw one of those on.  I think it is a little underpowered but like leXXington said it costs next to nothing to run it at WOT, so if I have to have it at WOT to stay on plane, so be it. most of the lakes I fish are fairly small so I'll only have to have it WOT for around 5-10 minutes.  I will be by myself most of the time and the other day I had a 200lb passenger so I think by myself I should be able to keep it on plane at around mayber 3/4 throttle (an extra 200lbs is a lot of weight) I will try to distribute the weight a little more evenly but besides my fishing rod, tackle bag, and all the safetly equipment (which is all up front in the storage compartment) I don't think there's a whole lot I can do.  I would've liked to upgrade to a bigger motor but the wife won't let me - so I'm stuck with the 25hp  Anyways, I'm going out again today - with about 100lbs less in the boat - so I'll post when I come back and see if that made a difference.  Thanks again for all the replys and helpful information"
220344,cisco,2008-06-27 14:53:00,597,I have an old Cresliner 15 fter with an old 25hp pushing it. BEST thing I ever invested in was a hydrofoil. Get onto plane quicker and stay on plane way longer.  I hear you can buy ones that don't require drilling screw holes.  Several folks here also advised you to install one. It'll save money in fuel and strain on the 25hp to push the boat onto plane. The Doel-fin one is only around $40. including tax at Bass Pro but requires 4 holes be drilled into the cavitation plate on the motor to install it.  I suggest you take the great hydrofoil advice folks gave you for your underpowered boat.  Sure made a world of difference on mine. And your motor being a 4-stroke with the power trim (unnecesary for a small motor like that in my opinion) means it's heavier than a regular 2 stroke witout power trim. I bet that poor little motor is quietly begging for a hydrofoil!
220354,Jay T,2008-06-27 15:14:00,282,"I have a 16' legend Pro Sport with the exact motor you have and I have no problem with keeping it at plane at 3/4 throttle or just under without the hydrofoil. I think lack of experience it the key, yeah a hydrofoil would help and make it a lot easier but getting to know your motor and boat is what you need to do. It is under powered IMO 1/2 the max, and so is mine I am at 5/8 of the max so not much under powered but I only had so much to spend. Just for your info you shouldn't be running that motor for more than 5min MAX full out when breaking it in. Keep at it and you will get it. Good luck"
220499,allbusiness,2008-06-28 00:24:00,23,"Well,  I just got back from the lake with the wife and having a 100lbs less in the boat made a world of difference, just had to use WOT to get it up onto plane and was then able to cut back to around 3/4 and it stayed on plane just fine. I'm still breaking the motor in so I only had it WOT for about 3-4 minutes at a time then eased back the throttle a little.  it would be nice to have a larger motor, but since I'll be fishing by myself 90% of the time, I think the 25 will do just fine, I can't wait to take it out by myself and see how much better it performs.  I think I just need to keep an eye on how much weight I put on the boat, as for the hydrofoil I refuse to drill holes into my new motor, unless I can find one that doesn't require drilled holes, I won't be putting one on this year - maybe next year when it isn't so new anymore.  anyway, having less weight in the boat improved performance 100%  Thanks for all the replys"
220501,allbusiness,2008-06-28 00:28:00,23," Yeah, it may not need the power trim, but I think it was the best 600$ I've ever spent, and I find it is nice to have. I would've regretted not getting it just to save a little money"
220507,Greencoachdog,2008-06-28 01:00:00,8163,"A lot of people don't realize how much weight and weight distribution affect vessel performance, especially the lower h.p. models.  At rest, your vessel should ""sit"" level in the water... forward to aft and port to starboard.  Always adhere to the load limits for your vessel, overloading can be very dangerous!!!"
220509,misfish,2008-06-28 01:03:00,29133,"Adapt, improvise, and overcome!"
220604,Spiel,2008-06-28 13:31:00,9065,  ....Here's your solution....No Drill Hydrofoil Stabilizer
220036,allbusiness,2008-06-26 22:24:00,23, With the 40 on the viper do you find you have to have it WOT the keep it on plane? I didn't have any problem getting my boat to plane today but if I cut the throttle back to roughly 3/4 (I don't have a tachometer) the bow would slowly start to rise until it came out of planing. I don't have a lot of experience with outboards so is it normal to have it WOT to keep it on plane? or should I be able to cut the throttle back a little bit and still stay on plane? I was wondering if I didn't have the motor trimmed out properly and if that was causing it to come out of planing when I cut the throttle back?
220042,jwl,2008-06-26 22:35:00,1056," no way, once on plane I can goof with the trim and run it at half throttle no probs at all..when you cut back on the throttle, trim the motor up more, you will see if you play around with it..hard to tell really when you are breaking themotor in cuz you can't really just give 'er and run the crap out of the motor to play around with it..you should not have to have your boat WOT throttle to keep it on plane...or to even get it on plane in the first place, and once on plane , with the trim adjusted well it should stay a smooth ride pretty much until you practically slow the boat right down..doesn't take much to get those boats on plane...the hull itself is only about 700lbs, my boat is probably heavier because it has more decking than the one you have."
220044,Gerritt,2008-06-26 22:39:00,6129,not to be off topic... but I thought 4 Strokes did not need a break in period??? was that not one of their virtues extolled by the boat gods on this forum in the 2 Stroke vs. 4 Stroke debate ?
220047,danbouck,2008-06-26 22:54:00,4380, i believe that was just the Evinrude E-tec 2 stroke
220049,jwl,2008-06-26 22:56:00,1056,"for allbusiness  in comparison, here is the differnce in the layout of my boat..they have the same hull, but layout is alot different, you may not have seen at a dealership if you got the boat new in comparison because they don't make this model any more for 2008.  I think maybe one of the reasons they took it out of thier line-up was sales...cuz in comparison as well the base price on the Viper compared to the Angler is about $3000 on the base package     "
220060,misfish,2008-06-26 23:27:00,29133,"I believe he,s state side now.LOL I do believe ,you are the next FF in line G.   I would offer,but I just lost 26 pounds."
220065,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-26 23:38:00,0,I also think you should get a hydrofoil or dol-fin or whatever its called. It will get you on plane even with a full load of people. It will keep you dry!!
220069,mikeh,2008-06-26 23:43:00,824,"if exchanging that motor for a bigger one is not an option, I recommend a hydrofoil. You can purchase them at BPS in Vaughn. They should give you a better whole shot plus keep the bow down."
220073,didoban,2008-06-26 23:48:00,65,"balance the load in your boat and try different pitch prop. I say lower pitch (will get you higher rpm, more punch at take off, slower top speed)."
220172,musky66,2008-06-27 02:21:00,273,You may eventually find a way to make your boat perform better with the existing motor- but you will be severely limited n the weather and lake conditions you can SAFELY fish in. Mu boat was similar to your in being underpowered and it really hit home one day on Balsam lake when my buddy and I were literally being stopped in our tracks at WOT by a strong wind and waves. It cost me a fortune to upgrade ( compared to buying the correct motor on the boat in the first place ) but it was the best money I have spent on fishing (next to my Beckman net!)
