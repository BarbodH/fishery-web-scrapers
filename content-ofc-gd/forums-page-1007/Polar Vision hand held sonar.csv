219898,Tie Twist,2008-06-26 16:57:00,10,"I am thinking of getting one of these Polar vision hand held units for my small inland lake portaging canoe trips, primarily for finding depth (and marking fish as a bonus I guess):  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true   Has anyone used one before? The key for me is that it is small and portable. If there are some alternatives I don't know of, I would love to hear them. Also, I have not found any in Ontario...anyone use them / found one in Ontario?"

220145,Tie Twist,2008-06-27 01:48:00,10,"Yeah, me too. I wouldn't mind a less expensive alternative, but it has to be very portable. Exactly what I am looking for though."
