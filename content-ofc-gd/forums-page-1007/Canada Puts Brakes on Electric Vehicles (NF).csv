219846,mooseroo,2008-06-26 14:56:00,80," How often do you haul 2 kids, 2 dogs, a trailer or whatever else? 2%-5% of the time, maybe?! Keep a log of the time you drive solo/with one passenger, towing nothing (to work, to the mall, to the ball game, etc...) and you'll be amazed! You do have the money to put a second car in your driveway... you're just burning it in your Suburban's tank every month. I'd love to know what you spend in gas every month on that Suburban?!  The gas money you'd save in driving a small car for the remaining 90% of your travels would probably get close to paying for the small car's monthly payments! You could keep your Suburban and buy a Civic, Elantra or other cheap small car!  Here's a fuel comparison of an Avalanche vs a Civic with old and new MPG measurements for city/highway/overall driving. Also includes Consumer Reports real world driving tests. EPA tests on a dyno with no wind/hills/cornering. CR measures in the field, driving the cars.  2006 Chevrolet Avalanche (available 4wd) ** Your Suburban is at least 1500 lbs heavier than this Avalanche according to Chevy!** Engine: 5.3L V8 Transmission: Automatic Old EPA City: 14 Old EPA Hwy: 18 Old EPA overall: 16  New EPA City: 13 New EPA Hwy: 17 New EPA overall: 14  CR City: 9 CR Hwy: 20 CR Overall: 13  2006 Honda Civic **Seats four comfortably... I own one and I'm 6'3"" tall and weigh around 250lbs and it's still comfortable. Engine: 1.8L 4-cyl. Transmission: Automatic Old EPA City: 30 Old EPA Hwy: 40 Old EPA overall: 34  New EPA city: 26 New EPA Hwy: 36 New EPA overall: 30  CR City: 18 CR Hwy: 43 CR Overall: 28  So according to the EPA and CR, the Civic would at minimum cut your monthly fuel costs in half! It's not even a hybrid/electric car.  Interesting fact: Statistics Canada pegs the number of Canadians that have ever/will ever take their SUVs off paved roads at under 13% of SUV owners! And, of those 13% of off-road going SUV owners, they are only going off of paved roads 2-4% of the time.   And others have the same rights to criticize them for driving them! The free market and gas prices will kill the ""glamour SUV"".  Check the news on Hummer these days! GM has stopped all work on the next generation H3, cancelled the H2 redesign, scrapped the H4 entirely, and they have hired Citibank to facilitate the sale of the brand.  http://blogs.fourwheeler.com/6255364/whats-new/next-gen-h3-cancelled-h4-shelved/index.html ://http://blogs.fourwheeler.com/625536...ved/index.html  U.S. auto sales dropped 8.5 percent in the first five months of 2008, led by the slump in demand for large pickups. Toyota's U.S. truck sales fell 7.3 percent in the same period! I wouldn't want to by working in a truck plant these days!"
219850,mooseroo,2008-06-26 15:08:00,80," Here's something to think about... would you rather spend two hours in your closed garage with an electric car running or a gas car running?  I thought so!  People that cry about economics and how we're all being manipulated, and ""the environmental lobby is all big business"" need to take a look around! Everything is big business and about making money!  ""Those damned environmentalists! They are just trying to manipulate us! They are just in it to make money! Those sweet oil companies are really into making fuel because they care about us! They really want to give it away! It's really the government taxes on fuel that are so high!... Oh...wait... I guess they are all into making money!""  Heard of solar? How about wind power? Sure, they all have some negatives, but relative to fossil fuels, they are minimal!"
220014,danbouck,2008-06-26 21:43:00,4380,   - I use about 40 dollars a month on gas for the suburban - My kids and dogs are with me 99% of the time - I am towing something 80% of the time - If gas is $4 a liter I will still be driving my suburban  As for wanting to criticize the people that want to drive SUV's that just childish. If you have the money to drive what you like go for it (Including a hummer  ).  The last thing I would want to do is get rid of something I enjoy because of a little extra money being spent.
220051,oncogene,2008-06-26 23:00:00,154," Yeah if i have too much spare money, I can buy a barrel of gas and just burn it in my backyard too... it's my money and my place yeah?!.  You're just missing the point...   $40 of gas a month for a suburban... So you only drive it for ~200km a month I guess?"
220058,forrest,2008-06-26 23:19:00,1032, If you have enough for a real Hummer you have enough money to by an economical car when you haul the kids and dog around.  No need to drive it for needs other than the off-road club.  An offroad club....its kind of a luxury (just about all hte toys we have are).......I guess one could also justify driving an Abrhams tank to work because they like blowing up sutff.  forrest
220120,Rich,2008-06-27 01:24:00,3927,"Why isn't anyone jumping all over the guys who run big boats? They use considerably more fuel than my 14 foot tinnie. And let's face it, a lot of those guys with big boats - don't need the big boat. Outboards and inboards pollute the air AND water. Do you criticize a guy for running a 22 foot boat?"
220161,forrest,2008-06-27 02:08:00,1032, A ban on all motors?  I could deal with that......old tyme styles paddle power?  How would the old guys get around?
220168,danbouck,2008-06-27 02:14:00,4380," I don't think I am the one missing the point here! I see you can figure out how much I drive it. That's a good start, now go back and get my point.    I think some people are just getting a little too peed off that they have to pay a little more at the pumps and want someone to yell at!"
220188,forrest,2008-06-27 02:37:00,1032, I'm not and I have not heard too many complaints about the price of gas.  I think the gist of this thread is one of conservation.  forrest
219585,Guest lundboy,2008-06-25 19:50:00,0,"Like I said, it is up to you to educate yourself.  If you think that I base all of my opinions on one guy's ""conspiracy theory"" you would be wrong.  There are a ton of FOIA (freedom of information act) and declassified documents that are now public that indicate just how far these oil companies, governments and ruling class have gone to ""limit"" refining and to cap off oil.  The climate change agendas, the eco agendas, all started and funded by elite foundations (Ford, Rockefeller, Warberg, Rand) fulfilling long term goals.  Oil limiting, false scarcity, carbon credits and taxes all part of the same game.  The Club of Rome stated in the 70s that Global warming would be the enemy of choice when searching for a new enemy (which in turn was humanity itself):  ""In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill ... All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself."" - in The First Global Revolution, pp.104-105 by Alexander King, founder of the Club of Rome and Bertrand Schneider, secretary of the Club of Rome  The Club of Rome is a huge global think tank, often used by the world powers to develop global agendas, and are behind UN agenda 21 (another piece of work against humanity).  The reason I pointed out that particular Lindsay Williams' links is because he is telling you what he witnessed in Alaska, and the reasons why the big oil intentionally cuts off the oil.  Not as a sole source of information, but one in which you may glean the extent of what is happening.  You would have to dig a lot deeper, way deeper to get the whole picture.  Way back to ancient Egypt and Babylon.  I can only point you to research what others have discovered, a lot of it 100% verifiable.  I can't make you understand it or want to dig deeper.  And I personally certainly can't explain it to you in any forum, you must research it yourself because it is so big and so incredible, so intricate and scripted that you would not believe any of it without taking the baby steps required to get the to meat of it.  The shock factor alone makes it too hard for most to pursue the extent and history of it.  Here's another link.  I hope you have the open mindedness to consider that there may be more going on than the cliche ""conspiracy theories"" that you have been conditioned to impose as a reason to dismiss something that doesn't express itself in pure scientific terms.  This is a ""reader's digest"" version of what I'm trying to get out to everyone.  Alan Watt has the proof, the original documents. He and many others are collecting them up before they are totally shoved down the memory hole.  Again read or don't it's up to you.  I'm glad that you at least took the time to read Lindsay William's document.  http://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/tra..._May302005.html"
219619,Gerritt,2008-06-25 21:02:00,6129,Lindsey Williams Document??!!?? it is a bloody infomercial!  G..
219629,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-25 21:41:00,314,Lindsay William's document is a joke.
219640,Clampet,2008-06-25 22:32:00,1947, Pride comes b4 a fall.
219641,Clampet,2008-06-25 22:34:00,1947," Can you imagine everybody coming home and plugging in their electric vehicle? How much hydro power would that require, and could they supply it?"
218416,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-23 14:53:00,0,"Do you know what is responsible for the Canadian soaring loonie?High gas prices....Oil is the number one money making thing in the entire world. (I think the way they rate currency is ridiculous to begin with).   We are talking HUGE profit margins. Why would the Canadian government that is backed by the oil industry, allow electric cars and ruin their goose that lays the golden eggs?  They want profits not progress......  It would be ideal for city travel and help out air quality down town. Whether Electricity, or Ethanol or Hydrogen is the way to go, time will only tell. What we do know for sure is that gasoline prices are too high and our climate will not be able to sustain a growing population of gasoline run cars. Once China and India get their auto industry in high gear, it will not be pretty for the climate...."
218428,barrystrs,2008-06-23 15:37:00,75,"I look forward to seeing electric vehicles on the road, but not the ones available today.  I believe the maximum speed for the Zenn is 40 kph.  If you have ever used an electric car,  you would realize how much they slow down going up a grade.  I would be surprised if it went 25kph up even a moderate grade.  I wonder if they have been tested when the batteries are cold?  Our traffic jams are bad enough now, and the hundreds of cars idling behind one of these fancy golf carts is going to waste a lot more fuel than it is going to save.  Never mind the lives lost due to accidents and road rage.  In my opinion any car on the road must be able to go with the flow of traffic. PS.  I use electic carts at work and they are terrific."
218809,Rich,2008-06-24 02:03:00,3927,"I know I posted the article, but I can't say whether I support electric cars or not. I like the idea of giving the gas companies some competition in hopes of lowering gas prices, however our country is already having electricity production problems. Electric cars would only worsen that and likely raise hydro prices. It seems kinda lose/lose to me either way.  The worst part is, a viable solution has probably been discovered and patented - the powers that be are just keeping it quiet."
218879,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-24 05:44:00,835,"Keep your eye out for the documentary ""who killed the electric car"".  When California legislated 0 emission cars the manufacturers made some very drivable electric cars and leased them, then fought the legislation till they killed it and rounded up the electric cars and crushed them.  I would rather see them build a better car than put a car on the road that doesn't rate just because the Americans do, then the Americans get a better car too."
218939,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-24 13:26:00,0,"We are having electricity production problems? Doubt it. They just made it seem that way so the politicians can privatize it and pocket some money. I think they privatized it anyways, but under the table.  Not long ago, we were powering a large part of Ontario and a large part of the USA with power generated from Niagara falls if I am not mistaken. Now I'm not sure if it is working full capacity, but a problem with the grid in Ohio, caused a black out here for several days? Something smells fishy.....  Pollywog. The first cars invented by Ford ran on electricity. The oil tycoons convinced Ford to use gasoline since it was really cheap at the time and that it would be more efficient. Well it ain't cheap anymore and it is a major polluter.  There are many rumours of cars made that don't run on gasoline but I am sure that they are all bought out by the oil tycoons.....I hear of all kinds of proto types every day, that run on everything from solar power, to hydrogen.  Profits have always gotten in the way of progress....."
219235,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-25 01:21:00,314,Oil companies buying inventions to replace gas powered cars.......  I say no way........  Huge rumor and myth  Why would someone bright enough to invent a better way to fuel the world sell it to the oil companies?  THEY WOULDNT  They would market and sell there own idea and become the next Bill Gates!!!  Totally non-sense thinking oil companies buy up idea's and hold them.   Thats media for ya making up crap to get viewers to watch and believe.  It falls into the same myth as theres a cure for cancer and aids but the pharmaceutical companies buy them up to maintain there profits.  NO WAY.  That would be like the messenger boy paying off alexander bell so he could keep his job!  Bottom line is..........  As of today there is not a cut in stone better alternative to oil.  Plain and Simple
