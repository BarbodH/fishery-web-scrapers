219327,figureight,2008-06-25 04:56:00,40,Awesome fish. thats what its all about.
219340,limeyangler,2008-06-25 05:54:00,5204,Thats a big fish Lew....great report.
219350,lew,2008-06-25 08:46:00,12767," Thanks everyone   Marty, it was so good to see Dawson having such an incredible time on his 1st ever trip to Canada and also to see all 3 generations of your family up there enjoying your trip together so much.  Father, son & grandson all fish'n together....that's what it's all about"
219388,RangerGuy,2008-06-25 12:41:00,564,Nice Report Lew... man it's going to be a long week after seeing your pictures LOL! We're going up Saturday morning  I hope the musky's are still biting  Nice fish
219398,Squid,2008-06-25 13:10:00,1656,"Awesome fish partner, figures you would catch one of them beasts when I am not there. Hopefully, there are more of those in August."
219401,Roy,2008-06-25 13:19:00,13728,"It couldn't have happened to a nicer fella. You work for those fish and you deserve everyone you get. I tell you Lew, when you showed me that pic on your camera on Saturday, I was really happy and impressed but what I really thought was ""justice has been served""  Good on ya!"
219406,TJQ,2008-06-25 13:38:00,7806,"LOL.. he he Lew's Compound is awesome... ""Chateau Muskie"""
219412,JohnAB,2008-06-25 13:46:00,178,Awesome fish Lew. Pics like that makes one thinking that a 2500 mile one way drive be worth it just for a chance to catch a big musky like that.
219448,mattyk,2008-06-25 15:51:00,2110,great fish Lew!
219592,fishnsled,2008-06-25 20:07:00,3520,  It wasn't the lenght but the thought of Lew keeping one of these big girls that was funny.  I get the impression that he treats these muskies like they are family and would not want to see any harm done to them whatsoever.
219733,ehg,2008-06-26 03:10:00,2666,"Thanks for your report on Lakair looks like a good time and good fishing for all.  BTW, that's a real nice musky! You even take a modest approach to that... Great fish again, ehg"
219766,lew,2008-06-26 10:02:00,12767," Sorry Jeff, I somehow missed your question.  I'll be back at Lakair on August 14th and will stay for 5 or 6 days.  Best of luck to you on your trip !!   And thanks again to everyone for your comments."
219825,Benthook,2008-06-26 13:56:00,56,You seize to amaze Lew....another job well done~!
219830,setomonkey,2008-06-26 14:09:00,872,"Beautiful musky, Lew, sounds like another great Lakair g2g.  Hard to imagine what it would be like to see a Nipissing monster if 48"" is only ""nice""!  Mike"
219849,Rattletrap2,2008-06-26 15:02:00,1652,"Lew, That sure is a beauty......but of course we expect no less from the Muskie Maestro! LOL"
220048,Cookslav,2008-06-26 22:54:00,1457,Thats fine way to start the season off! Thanks for sharing that.  I was working that same bait on the moon river this weekend...didn't work out for me the way I hoped but its nice to know it catches fish for somebody
220090,Rich Clemens,2008-06-27 00:41:00,3131,So that's what a musky looks like ?    Congrats Lew ... glad you were able to trigger a hit.  Patsy and I tried for 5 days straight ... never even having a follow.
220103,fishindevil,2008-06-27 01:03:00,6254,Nice musky lew !!!!!...great picture as well...cheers

219162,jediangler,2008-06-24 23:08:00,1923,Beauty fish lew. That is one chunky puppy.
219163,wvmedic,2008-06-24 23:10:00,144,Lew when in Aug. are you going to be there? My family and I will be there the 2nd. thru the 9th.  Jeff.
219202,Marty,2008-06-25 00:21:00,873,"Lew,  Outstanding fish bud.  I want to thank you for the kind gestures up there.   Dawson had a blast.    On the way home, he had my computer and was looking at all the fishing pics I have.   As he was browsing, he saw the pic of your big one on the Ottawa/Larry.   He got so excited and said ""Dad, I know him.  Wow, he does catch big muskies!"""
219213,Nanook,2008-06-25 00:47:00,565," The ""Maestro"" strikes a gain   Nice fish Lew ! Glad the new tent worked out fine for you."

219230,mike hagan,2008-06-25 01:17:00,50,WOW nice fish Lew. Getting up and getting to the spot on such a nice morning is almost as nice as catching the big one . Many thanks for the report.
219239,Loonietoon,2008-06-25 01:25:00,1450,Looks good on you Lew... Excellent catch
219242,Pigeontroller,2008-06-25 01:29:00,2793,"Nice one Lew, I'm still waiting for my first of the season..."
219251,muskymike,2008-06-25 01:39:00,772,"Hmmm Lew, how did you photoshop yourself over me? hahaha  Great fish. I am jealous, I think I need to get out with you and learn a thing or 1000.  Glad to hear you had a great time."
219263,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-25 02:03:00,957,A heavy fish Lew.  Way to go.
219297,Ron,2008-06-25 03:07:00,1683,"Awesome fish Lew. I like when you catch all these muskies, just means there is another one educated.  Good on ya bud!"
218975,lew,2008-06-24 15:29:00,12767,"Hi guys, I got home from Lakair this morning after another fabulous week up there and can't wait to get back up there again in August.  As has already been said in several posts, the 2008 trip was excellent as it every year. We had some scattered showers Wednesday & Thursday, then myself & Aplumma got caught in a huge downpour on Friday but other than that everything was beautiful.  I was using a new tent & dining shelter this year and everything worked out perfectly and never leaked a drop even in the heaviest of the rains.    Musky season opened on Saturday for Lake Nippissing and I was on the water & heading for a favorite spot as the sun was breaking over the horizon and when it looks this pretty, you just know the rest of the day has to go well too.    There was a nice chop on the water and I wanted to start casting to a  rocky point up in Muskrat Bay before it got too bright out. I was twitching a new Firetiger Shallow Raider and after  a few minutes it got smacked real hard by a musky I but only had her on for a few seconds before she spit the hook.  With the cool water this season the cabbage isn't as high or as dense as usual in many areas, but I headed to another favorite spot about 1/4 away mile to have a look and found some nice thick patches in some areas with plenty of open water between them which is something I actually prefer to cast to, rather than trying to cover a huge indistinguishable flat of weed.  I got downwind & clipped on a large black/orange Grim Reaper spinner bait and started working it thru the cabbage patches. The wind was working in my favour and with the help of the tracking lines on my GPS I was able to make several long drifts towards shore and move about 50' apart for each consecutive drift and cover all the patches.  On  the 4th drift and about 150' west of my starting point, I tossed the bait out and almost as it touched the water about 50' away, this big girl nailed it from just under the surface put up an excellent fight before I got her in the net.  A quick picture and measurment  and she took off strong and headed for home.  It was interesting too as I  got her only about 100 yards from where I landed another big fish in the fall of 05 and both fish came from 8 fow in the cabbage patches.  I'm already lookin forward to heading back up there in August to see if this girls Momma is hanging around the same area.    Thanks to all the OFNers who helped make this another fabulous week @ Lakair"
218979,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 15:34:00,7971,Great report Lew.  It was a real pleasure to see you again up there this year.  I took your advice and checked out that area you mentioned where you got that nice musky in your pic.  Had a follow and strike...just no hook set.  I think my heart is still pounding....LOL.  Glad to see you made it home safe.
218980,Whopper,2008-06-24 15:36:00,2174,Nice fish Lew!  Glad to hear you had a good time
218984,snag,2008-06-24 15:44:00,1932,Awesome!  What were the measurements?
218985,BillM,2008-06-24 15:45:00,17367,I'm jealous.... very jealous!!!  Awesome fish lew!

218993,jwl,2008-06-24 15:57:00,1056,"nice fish...all you guys with the nice musky pics are killing me, I can't give it a go until like Sunday or Monday.  That must have been the biggest fish caught on that trip, thanks for the big gigantic teaser"
218996,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-24 16:00:00,0,WOW! What a beast!! Good to hear you had a great time and that the trip was a success. Thanks for sharing.
218999,lew,2008-06-24 16:04:00,12767,"Sorry boys, she was 48 inches, I thought I included that.  A nice fish but certainly not a monster by Nippisssing standards though."
219003,Beans,2008-06-24 16:14:00,3339,Nice one Lew !...  Definately bigger than Maureen's but then again she doesn't have your experience...  48 inches eh?...one inch shorter you would have had to release her...like it or not...
219004,highdrifter,2008-06-24 16:15:00,2534,Right on Lew!  You look like you're straining under the wheight of that fish.  Beauty!  cheers HD

219053,addict,2008-06-24 18:30:00,475,very nice fish and oh so serious pose nice job.
219056,solopaddler,2008-06-24 18:33:00,8605,"Very decent fish Lew! Fish of a lifetime for most people, for you just another notch in the belt eh?  (Your new camping gear looks great!)"
219058,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-24 18:38:00,1362,Very nice fish indeed Lew!!  ....just think of what she'll weigh in at in the fall!!!
219062,aplumma,2008-06-24 18:46:00,6896,See I told you I wouldnt jinx your boat if you took it fishin. Nice fish Lew I hope to get out next year with you when we can actually fish for musky istead of pike.   Art
219064,linweir,2008-06-24 18:49:00,202,Waht a giant. Good..d.
219066,Musky or Specks,2008-06-24 18:51:00,2710,Very nice fish Lew didnt land anything that big this weekend but my buddy lost the fish of a lifetime casting a Grim Reaper bucktail to the Canadian Side Fish took and sounded screaming drag the whole way. Had it on for 5 minutes Head shaking the whole time but could get it off bottom then nothing reel up hooks pulled out. I think hes still shaking. We ve caught many fish in the high 40's and Ive been on the boat when a 37 lber was landed but nothing Ive seen put up a fight like this.
219069,TJQ,2008-06-24 19:02:00,7806,Good job Lew!! It was really nice to see you again.
