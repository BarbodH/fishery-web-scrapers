What happens is that when you stop for a red light a young, nude woman comes up and pretends to be washing your wind- shield. While she is doing this another person opens your back door and steals anything in the car.  They are very good at this. They got him 3 times last Friday and twice on Saturday.  He wasn't able to find them on Sunday."
