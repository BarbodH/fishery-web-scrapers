220148,Sinker,2008-06-27 01:52:00,8692,I'd expect you to be all teeth as you rip up the lake with your new tiller  You'll prolly run 25-30mph with a 30. My 40 2 stroke does around 30 on a 16fter.  Sinker
220151,modny,2008-06-27 01:54:00,502,"nice, that makes me smile already.  the boat doesn't have much in it.  iwas thinking of modding the boat so that the gas tank is under the middle "" seat/cross member"" kind of like how the lunds are, maybe this would help with weight distribution"
220155,Sinker,2008-06-27 01:59:00,8692,"Mine is bare bones too. Just a floor, and one bench seat in the front.......all the rest is wide open. Gas tank and batteries in the back.....on either side.  Its light and very responsive with the 40 on it.......my engine is lighter and has more power than a 30 4 stroke though, so its hard to compare them.  Your gonna have fun regardless  What was on it before?  Sinker"
220157,hogman3006,2008-06-27 02:03:00,41,might I suggest a stainless prop. It can do wonders.
220159,modny,2008-06-27 02:04:00,502,"it had a  early 90's merc 20 2 stroke.  i remember YEARS ago a friend clocked us doing 25 mph, me, my lil bro and my dad. mind u i was like 10 and he was 8. haha  now 15 years later.. its a lil different.  the 20 broke down, then we tried upgrading it to a 25 horse, with a 25 horse power pack etc, but so far no luck, we'll save that for another post..  to be honest, i was really lookin at a nice merc 40 2 strok til with trim and oil inj. but it was 10 years older, and i felt it would take more to maintain.  i think it should haul pretty good. and be nice and quiet"
