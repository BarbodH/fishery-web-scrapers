220170,kickingfrog,2008-06-27 02:16:00,8333,"Don and Ruth were very generous and offered me a spot in their boat during the pike Derby. I had a great time, even if I did lose a solid second place fish due to my own foolishness. The free board difference between my canoe and that beauty are significant to say the least.  Thanks guys."
220207,Cudz,2008-06-27 03:40:00,2652,That is a nice boat!   There is a dealer for similar boats in Barrie.  They are called Custom Weld boats and they are very impressive as well.
