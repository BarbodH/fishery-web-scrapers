639033,fishing n autograph,2011-11-10 12:44:00,2540,"Well, as far as I know the surgery went well. We don't know the outcome yet because the doctor never talked to us and even if he did he wouldn't be able to tell us if he got everything without further testing.  Mom is doing well, she is in a lot of pain and is very nautious. We're not sure if it is from the anesthetics or from the morphine she was given after the surgery. Either way she wasn't feeling well when we brought her home yesterday. As for my dad,well, god help him lol. I love my dad to death but the man is kind of useless when it comes to taking care of himself or my mom. So, I've taken the next few days of work off to take care of my mom and babysit my dad lol.  Hopefully she slept well last night because I know I didn't lol$"
639035,danbouck,2011-11-10 12:57:00,4380,Glad the surgery went well
639038,woodenboater,2011-11-10 13:40:00,2277,fingers crossed that the days ahead bring very good news for your mom
639044,NBR,2011-11-10 14:11:00,163,"Dave, Two weeks ago we had dinner with a couple. She is a 15 year breast cancer survivor. Years ago the prognosis was dismal but today it is much better.  Prayers for you all!"
639045,bucktail,2011-11-10 14:14:00,1857,Good thoughts for you and your family! hopefully they got it all!
639133,fishnsled,2011-11-10 20:13:00,3520,"Nice to know that the surgery went well. Thanks for the update, positive thoughts your way."
639134,NAW,2011-11-10 20:19:00,4022,"I'm sure no matter how crappy your mom feels, she's happy to be home, and to have you around for a few days to keep her company.  Good on ya.  Best Wishes for a speedy complete recovery.  My grandmother is 82, and has survived two rounds of cancer both over 20 years ago."
639135,Spiel,2011-11-10 20:38:00,9065,The fact that she's home would suggest (I hope) that things went very well.
639171,fishing n autograph,2011-11-10 23:32:00,2540,"Yes, her surgery went well. We brought her home yesterday afternoon and she was in rough shape. She was very nautious from the anesthetic and morphine. I stayed with them until late last night. So needless to say I didn't get much sleep because my dad being an old fashion dad, can't really take care of himself.  This morning I woke up and helped get my kids ready for school and headed over there. When I showed up my mom was a different person. She was up and about feeling better but still in pain. So I helped out at their place, but man, I forgot how boring it was there lol.  Thanks for the support guys! She has to wait a week for the results from her lymph nodes to see if the cancer has spread."
639172,fishing n autograph,2011-11-10 23:37:00,2540,"I forgot to add that the home care nurse came this morning. After changing the bandages she said mom wasn't drain much and that she is healing well. Surprisingly, she had no stitches, they used some sort of glue!"
639174,Fish Farmer,2011-11-10 23:40:00,2234,"My thoughts go out to your mom and dad, she will be better in no time."

631042,Nipfisher,2011-10-15 02:12:00,2449,"Dave, My mother went through this in 2008. She had all the treatments and a masectomy. When her hair grew back WHITE, she decided to leave it like that and never colour it again. It was a bigger shock to us then the surgery. She is happy and healthy now (she's 65). Pictured with my neices and nephews.        My mom is a very strong person and she struggled. BUT with family support she will make it through this. My thoughts are with you. Blair"

They have come a looooong way in sucessfully treating this form of cancer - a co worker was diagnosed with it this spring - had treatments, masectomy and is now 100% free, all in less than 8 months.  It can be beaten."

630824,fishing n autograph,2011-10-14 16:26:00,2540,"Well, I got a call yesterday and I found out that my mother has breast cancer. The doctor found a small mass and a biopsy confirmed that it was cancerous.  She and the doctors have no idea how far along the cancer is or if it has spread. She is scheduled for surgery in November. I haven't seen my mother cry so much since my grandmother died almost 20 yrs ago. She's a strong woman, but I don't know if she can handle this. My father is also a wreck and with his heart I'm worried he'll have a heart attack.  Anyways, I'm wondering if everyone could say a prayer or send positve thoughts her way.  Thanks all  Dave"

Keep focusing on the positive outcome that could be your Mom's.  If she hasn't already, have your Mom watch The Secret. There is a great part in there for her. In times like this, it doesn't matter how ""out there"" believing in something may seem, if there is even a slight chance it might work, it's worth a shot!

My mom had a mesectomy done and has been cancer free ever since. She is 75 yrs old and had a choice of removing the breast or just the affected area. She was told there would be a better chance of getting all of it if the breast was removed. She said I don't need em anymore so take it all off. There was no doubt in her mind or mine that she would make a full recovery. Stay positive and I will say aprayer for your mom as well.
