His future, like a book With half the pages still uncut.  This was my brother At Dieppe. The one who built me a doll house When I was seven. Complete to the last small picture frame. Nothing forgotten.  He was awfully good at fixing things, At stepping into the breach when he was needed.  That's what he did at Dieppe; He was needed. And even death must have been a little shamed At his eagerness"
