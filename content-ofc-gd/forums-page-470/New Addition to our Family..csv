After a long search, we finally chose a new pup last night and put a deposit down on a 3 week old male Victorian Bulldog puppy. We will picking him up middle to late December and are very excited. We're tossing around a few names but it would nice to hear some cool, original names that you guys could come up with.  Here's a few that we were tossing around.  Revo Ozzy Bubba Koda Jack  Cheers, Colin  Here's Domi enjoying one of his last treats........his last meal was a nice 1lb raw Sirloin steak I got for him.

They are such a joy, although exhausting sometimes    Enjoy him and again, congrats.  We just got ours two weeks ago.  I did the whole name search and picked Iggy for our French Bulldog, but Paul told me a dog picks his own name once you have them.  Sure enough, the first name out of Paul's mouth was ""Ralphy.""  I wasn't so sure but after calling him Iggy and Paul Calling him Ralphy, he ended up coming to Ralphy every time.  So now his name is Ralphy and it does suit him  Here he is at 9 weeks  "

I usually call her ""ping pong"" or ""pingers"" because she bounces like a ping pong ball. If Granny is around, she will ignore me and only answer to Peewee.  Your pup is too cute, Joey."
