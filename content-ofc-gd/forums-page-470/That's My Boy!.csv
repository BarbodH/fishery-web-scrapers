639124,torco,2011-11-10 19:09:00,656,My daughter is only 18 months but seeing that really makes me excited for my daughters future.  I can only imagine your pride as a Dad! Well done and congrats to your son his first steelhead!
639130,myot,2011-11-10 19:50:00,131,I have had my daughter out since she was 10 months old she is 6 now and most of my highlight fishing trips have involved her in the last year or so. Great job Mike  Dan

638240,ketchenany,2011-11-07 23:40:00,3229,"thanks for posting Solo, another kid who will have a very fulfilling life ahead of him with a dad like you. I still remember when my daughter caught her first trout at Glenn Haffy, many years later she discovered shoes and boys and advertising, and now a proud mother of a fine young man that hopefully I can take back and he will get his first one. when I do it I'll bring my camera and try to find the spot where her picture was taken."

638311,Handlebarz,2011-11-08 01:37:00,3790,thats just dang awesome congrats on getting him hooked early it sure is nice when they take after the old man and it reminds me of being a youngster fishing Dennie dam with dad I think I was 7-8 the first trip I had to stay on shore and dad would fish from the center of the river I would almost hit guys every once in a while dad would remind me to take shorter casts them days last for ever.
638320,ChrisK,2011-11-08 02:03:00,2772,Good on ya Mike.The kid looks like a reel natural

638481,strakey,2011-11-08 17:41:00,78,"Very nice Mike. Glad to see you teaching him early, but don't forget that the student passes the teacher one day. Can't wait for my turn."

638548,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-08 21:40:00,655,That's pretty awesome Mike! Can't wait for my son to be old enough for that

638574,solopaddler,2011-11-08 23:24:00,8605,"Thanks guys. I know every dad can relate to my pride.      Just this morning he told me flat out, ""Daddy I know everything about fishing already!!"", ""You don't have to teach me anything!!""  This after I told him he had to grow a bit and learn how to handle a fly rod before I let him use the spey rod.  Oh brother."
638606,Whopper,2011-11-09 00:47:00,2174,Awesome stuff Mike
638611,Remastered,2011-11-09 00:54:00,143,I guess you can't go wrong with a solo Junior. One that'll catch more fish than a Solo Senior...
638881,codfather,2011-11-09 23:44:00,8,way to go Brendan To his Dad   That boy is hook now
638883,limeyangler,2011-11-09 23:55:00,5204,Nice one Mike ....good stuff Brendan.  That video was the BEST!  Grinning from ear to ear here after he starts laughing near the end....priceless!
637979,solopaddler,2011-11-07 10:50:00,8605,"My son Brendan just turned 5 last month and last month reached another milestone in his young life, his first steelhead.  Every time I go now he begs me to come. It's tough to say no, and so far this fall he's been out with me a few times, and considering his young age, has done pretty well.  He recently caught 3 completely on his own, casting and drifting a 7' spinning rod rigged with a float.  Yep, he can already handle the big boy rod and reel with no problem.           I'm calling this one his first official steelhead. Yeah it was just a small skipper, but with help from dad he set the hook and landed it on my 13' float rod and centre pin reel.   That's my boy.   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7NqCcpxOteE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

637984,Musky or Specks,2011-11-07 11:08:00,2710,Been waiting for this report Mike good job on getting him out I guess steelheading is to much of a foulweather thing for the daughter. Your son can now say to her that she's never caught a steelhead.

Riley doesn't have the bug like my little guy, don't want to force it on her either.  It's funny you mention him upping her, or bettering her somehow. He's been reminding his big sister of that fact constantly LOL!    Anytime Gord, but I'm not going to track you down for an invite. You already know you're welcome.  It's up to you buddy."
