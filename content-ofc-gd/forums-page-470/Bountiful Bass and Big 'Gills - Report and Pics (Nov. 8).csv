Launched the boat at 10:30am and motored over to the productive spot that coughed up most of the fish the previous week. I decided to work in a bit shallower than before, hoping the largies would be relating to the cabbage and rocks that are prolific between 6- and 12-feet of water. Seeing a large school of baitfish in tight also helped with the decision.  FOR THE FULL REPORT AND TO VIEW ALL OF THE PICS, CHECK OUT:  http://justinhoffmanoutdoors.com/2011/11/09/bountiful-bass-and-big-gills-quebec-style/          Good Fishing,  Justin"
