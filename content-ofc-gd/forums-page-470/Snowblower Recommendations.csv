638721,smally21,2011-11-09 13:46:00,993,"i have a husqvarna snowblower and lawnmower. did a ton of research on the snowblower and didn't even know husky made snowblowers - build quality vs. price was remarkable - cheaper then just about anybody (except  the depot!) and heavy build, sealed bearings, etc...  i didn't think much of the ariens but they seem very popular! wouldn't have anything to do with the fact they are economical and at the front door of every home depot?"
638728,Jer,2011-11-09 14:01:00,1426,"My guess is that the Ariens you see at the Home Depot have very little in common with the Ariens of 10 or 20 or even 30 years ago that everybody raves about.  I'd say the Toro is probably your best built machine for the money these days. Besides, you'll get much better service in the future if you buy from a reputable independent dealer."
638740,bigbuck,2011-11-09 15:06:00,2449,"My Toro is 20 years old and still starts on the 1st pull every time. It's a 5hp 21 inch 2 stage. For my purposes here in the 'burbs, it's fine. You need a minimum 8hp maybe even a 10 or 12hp depending on how much snow you need to clear. I'd go with Toro, Ariens is fine as well but buy it from a dealer who will set it up and make sure it runs properly. Home Depot will charge you to assemble it and you have to make sure it's running properly."
638741,BillM,2011-11-09 15:10:00,17367,"Ariens, no doubt."

638803,Old Man,2011-11-09 19:37:00,822,"The new John Deere's are just re-branded Simplicity snowblowers. Simplicity it's self as a brand is owned by Briggs Stratton who also own the Murry, Snapper and numerous other brands.  As I said earlier, I love my Ariens Platinum, but also strongly considered Honda. I personally think Honda makes the best, especially their tracked models, but they do come at a considerably higher price. When making comparison to the Ariens and considering my needs, I just couldn't justify the extra cost of the Honda.  I'd also like to echo several other's opinion that buying from a dealer is worth the support and set up. My Ariens dealer in Fort Francis has be great and their prices were competitive with the Home Depot's of the world."
638816,davey buoy,2011-11-09 20:07:00,5505,"Just to add my 2 cents, Ive had the same 10/27 Murry select From home depot and have done oil changes every year,no problems.Imagine that in Barrie. I agree 10hp or greater is a must if you have any snow at all. A good cover to help slow down the rust and added weathering to the pull cord. Oh by the way I have a plastic shute and I add hot water some times because of freezing"
638832,mercman,2011-11-09 21:16:00,7054,"  I use spary lithium grease a couple of times a winter on the aiming gear, and i spray ''Heat'' deicer for windshields on the chute if it freezes, but i rarely have this problem unless its really wet snow."

639017,blue pickeral,2011-11-10 09:54:00,267,"It seems that this outfit - MTD Canada- makes quite a few snow blowers under different names:  http://www.mtdcanada.com/home.asp  It you buy one of them, parts are not a problem as they are shared over several makes.  I purchased a Cub Cadet two years ago. Home Depot was selling them, but did not sell the replaceable lugs??? They did not sell tire chains for them either - salesperson told me with the tires they came with, you wouldn't need them. (absolute baloney)A part-timer would be assembling it for $40 or so.  So I went to a local dealer-Georgian Small Engines. They took a deposit of 25% for pickup the following weekend. Following weekend, no one had any knowledge of my blower! They did get one together in an hour. I ended up re-assembling it myself as parts were loose.  The snow blower works okay now. But I'd recommend learning something about them before purchasing."

I have a 4 wheeler/ATV with plow but sometimes if the snow is drifted or we get more than I can push and Ramp up, a Blower would help. I have been spoiled as the neihbour has a big blower on His Tractor and He was doing some cleanup for me, However this year He is going to Florida for 3 Months,  What Size,HP,Brands etc would anyone recommend.

638594,mikeseb,2011-11-09 00:35:00,201,Agreed! toro is the best when it comes to snowblowers and commercial grade lawnmowers.  A bit expensive compared to the other guys but its worth it.  Another good option is ariens which can be found at most home depots.  For a toro you will have to find an independent dealer.
638596,Flappn,2011-11-09 00:37:00,245,Ensure the unit you purchase doesn't have plastic on any part of the chute.

638602,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-09 00:42:00,10439,"Toro are a good machine. As for size 28""-30"" and 10-12 HP is a good all around size. When I lived back in Ontario I used a 10HP 30"" maching to do my 200' driveway and it would take about 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending on snow depth. When we get those big winter storms with the high winds it was not up to the task as the snow got hard like concrete in our wide open driveway. When that happened we just called up one of the neighbours with a tractor and blower combo. There's no way a small blower like that is going to handle 5' deep drifts that a 200# man can walk on without breaking through."

All steel construction and made in the USA! I would stay away from anything with plastic components in the chute area as well. I almost made the mistake of buying a ""Murray"" by MTD. There is no comparison between the two machines! Mind you, the price difference was $600, but worth every penny."

638692,Big Cliff,2011-11-09 09:55:00,6899," X 3  I would suggest getting it from a dealer though, you'd be amazed at how many of these things right out of the box aren't tuned properly. You MIGHT pay a little bit more (sometimes even less) than buying it from a big box store but you will get much better service if you ever do need it.  As for what size to get; that really depends on how big an area you need to clear. If you are only going to use it occasionally to cut back drifts or snow banks or is it going to be your primary snow removal tool now?"
638697,fish_fishburn,2011-11-09 10:42:00,1311,"I just had a new Ariens delivered to my door last weekend from my local dealer. I purchased the 30"" 12.5 hp. I payed 1575.00 plus tax, free set up and delivery. Home Depot was 1599.00 and setup was 40.00 and delivery was extra as well.  The reason I recommend Ariens is because they are made to last. My last one I purchased in 93, a 8hp 24"". Never had any issues with it, but basic maintenance which I took care of myself. Two weeks ago I put new belts on it and a new bearing and sold it for 350.00 to my neighbour.  Another reason for buying a Ariens is that their parts distribution is second to none even if your machine is 25 yrs old or more. Trust me on this one, you won't be disapointed."

Cliff  I use the ATV with plow most of the time, But if we get a big dump with lots of wind the Bike will only push so uch, and by mid winter the driveway is getting narrower!!

638713,Fish4Eyes,2011-11-09 13:21:00,1022,If your interested in the Ariens go to Home Depot on saturday and tell them rona has 15% off one item and see if they will price match it. Would be a pretty good savings.
