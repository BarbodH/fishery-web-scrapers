637793,Billy Bob,2011-11-06 12:43:00,5865, Forgot to turn the clocks back....and the dog doesn't know how to turn her clock back either....
637794,bassman87,2011-11-06 12:51:00,586,"had both lowrance and hummingbird. i say go with lowrance, hands down better unit and service. just my opinion tho"
637796,lew,2011-11-06 13:01:00,12766,"Speaking of Lowrance service, where are they located now ??  They used to be on Matheson in Missisauga but evidentely they've moved from that location."
637798,mercman,2011-11-06 13:20:00,7054,"Just for the record, I am an equal opportunity angler.I have an X135 lowrance on the bow of my boat.Its only a finder, but i have no issues with it.I have no issue with the sonar on the hummunbird either, just the GPS. The Lowrance units came from the Brand new Ranger B/B that my brother bought a couple of years ago. He removed them immediately and replaced with humminbird units, and has never had an issue.He has always had humminbird. I had 2 x135 units, one is on my boat, and last year 4x4bassin was looking for a sonar, and i gave him one n/c. I dont need to know which one is best, my decision on brand has already been made.I believe my unit is defective,and just needed  some info, and your opinion regarding thier response. Thanks "
637801,mercman,2011-11-06 13:27:00,7054,"  Hummmm, interesting. I had a small issue/question on my x135, went to customer support, sent the email form, 6 months and 2 follow ups later not even a confirmation of of my questions."
637813,Billy Bob,2011-11-06 14:11:00,5865,"Merc.....When I purchased my first Lowrance LMS 520C unit, it had a small problem reading very shallow depths in thick weeds....I went on the BBC Board Forum site( http://www.bbcboards.net/zeroforum?id=13 )and everyone there said to contact Linda Colt...I did via email and she sent me out a Brand New Unit with NO money exchanged or even my credit Card for deposit, only on trust. When I received my new unit I put the original purchased unit in the box that came with the replacement which also has a postage free sticker back to Lowrance via UPS....now if anyone can beat that I would love to deal with that company also....Humminbird screw me years ago with a flasher unit...but that's another story all together.

637818,Skipper D,2011-11-06 14:24:00,1970,"Hi , its Skip here this morning filling in for our dearly departed Mr Rooney . It dose'nt make any sence to me at all why we have to rush down to the store to buy the latest Gps gadgets then rush home , get them out of the box and go out and try them to see how accurate they are . Then to find out they are incapable of putting us back on the head of a pin every time  we  want to get back to where we were yesterday . For me i 'd have too say that there is not realy all that many fish in the area the size of the head of a pin would'nt you . Personaly i like fishing a area of about 500'x500' at a time where they can fit in more fish doubling my chances and  that i can line up with by useing a tree or a rock seen on shore , gadgets that mother nature put there for free for every one to take advantage of and to which suite my pocket book just fine for now and in the future leaving something left over so i can get myself an icecream cone when i want or for any one in my family as far as that go's . So i strongly suggest boys and girls , keep the money and go back to useing mother nature , its alot easyer on the brain ..... thats how i see it ."
637822,Terry,2011-11-06 15:13:00,14456,"people will say the make they have is the best  just like trucks.........so ignore all that....it's useless info for the most part  speed should be very accurate over a few seconds of time it figures your speed by your position and the time it took to get there, so they are giving you a snapshot of your speed every few seconds  and really GPS for fisherman has not been around all that long it seems maybe late 80s..just guessing gps was off by 300 ft + or- was useless for finding your way back to a rock in the middle of the lake then Loran-c a land based signal would correct the inaccuracy of the gps but expensive and only worked in some areas then in the 90s..they dropped the military encryption so we were closer to being accurate..then waas not long ago and we are within 10 ft accurate..guessing from memory so don't quote me"
637823,Billy Bob,2011-11-06 15:17:00,5865,I had a Loran C unit.....GPS is much better.
637825,Terry,2011-11-06 15:22:00,14456,well yeah now  but back in the beginning it was the only game in town
637828,mike rousseau,2011-11-06 15:34:00,4661,I have spots that are literally 20-30 feet long... Literally... I wanted accuracy...  I thought the days of lining up Chanel markers with tv towers and trees were in the past...  It's a good thing I was taught that skill as well...
637841,charlesn,2011-11-06 16:51:00,551," I've had 9 diff Lowrance units. X25 (died), X135, X75, X85, X15, LMS 330 (died), 4 x LMS 332 (all died), 2 x LMS 520 (both died), X 26 (gps died 2 twice on day 1 of multi-day trip or tournament).  I'm not surprised the older units are still kicking - I bet my old x15 and X75/X85 are probably still working too.  Navico (who bought Lowrance) certainly don't build them the way they used to.  Buddy had 2 HDS 8s right out of the box dead on arrival.  Anyone can go google the unbelievable amount of Lowrance issues and customer service issues they've had in the last few years.  I was as die-hard of a Lowrance fanboy as there could be - but enough was enough.  I now run an 1197 and 858 networked combo that is pretty awesome.  BUT I also added an HDS 5 in dash as well for gps only backup because it can't hurt to have some insurance.  I might also go to dual 858s up front to have a dedicated sonar unit and a dedicated map unit.  Would be a bit more insurance in case 1 goes down.  Better safe than sorry.  No manufacturer out there makes a perfect trouble free unit - only a paid shill would even try to claim that.  Humminbird is definitely better than Lowrance at the moment in terms of reliability but they both should be a lot better for the amount of money we pay.  Go google the results of Lowrance vs Humminbird issues and see for yourself.  If we paid 2000+ for a laptop - would we settle for 10-15 second start up times, constant firmware upgrades just to be usable and 3-4 week waits for dead on arrival units?"
637843,charlesn,2011-11-06 16:54:00,551, How many Navico built Lowrance units have you used Roy?
637844,charlesn,2011-11-06 16:57:00,551, Unfortunately very common.
637846,charlesn,2011-11-06 16:59:00,551, Funny you mention Linda Colt.  Maybe google what Lowrance did to her as her reward for spectacular customer service.  Or go through the BBC archives to see how they treated her.  That was in my opinion the beginning of the end for their Customer Service.  She truly did treat customers like human beings and people as opposed to wallets attached to a number.
637876,mercman,2011-11-06 20:34:00,7054,  Thank you Charles
637880,GbayGiant,2011-11-06 20:54:00,1780,"Charlesn, you have had a very bad string of luck. I have not had to purchase another unit since I bought the 104c eight years ago. It was also discontinued like every one of the units you bought. It is still going strong like every Lowrance unit I have had. It must be a good string of luck."
637881,Billy Bob,2011-11-06 21:14:00,5865,"You know what......buy and use ""Birds"" while I find my way back to the hot spots and catch all the fish...."
637883,mercman,2011-11-06 21:44:00,7054,"Ok everyone.I think i have all the info i need.Thank you all for you input. Personally, i dont give a dang what you are all using.I don`t even care which brand you find better. Fact is, i own a Bird GPS,which in my opinion is deffective.It is still under warranty so it will be up to humminbird to do the right thing. I will keep you all up to speed on this, so please, lets not get this thread locked up."
637885,Billy Bob,2011-11-06 21:55:00,5865,Lock em up....LOL...  Sure take your unit and go home....baby..
639383,mercman,2011-11-11 19:32:00,7054,"As promised, a follow up to this thread. The unit was repaired, the card reader and the pcb containing the GPS chip has been replaced also. I also got an email directly from Humminbird in response to my concerns.So Humminbird gets Brownie Points for customer service 1 1/2 years later and i still have not heard from Lowrance in response to the email i sent regarding my x135. Here are the emails from both Humminbird and the serviceing company FishnTech.   Paul, I have your unit ready to go, I was mistaken when I told you the external antenna might help your situation, as it turns out the 500 series will not even accept the external antenna. I changed the card reader and the keyboard pcb that contains the gps antenna, the gps will not work with heading and speed unless you are moving at 1/2 mph. This is directly linked to the gps chip receiver that is used. Regards, GaryFISHNTECH514-990-8144 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Dear Paul,      Thank you for contacting Humminbird. We appreciate your interest in our products.     This occurs due to our units do not assume the heading is the same as the heading it was travelling when the unit/boat came to a stop so it will continuously look for the proper heading until you start to travel at .25mph or faster.  This is considered acceptible by our guidelines and we feel there is no issues with the GPS. If you experience issues with the icon on the chart view not correcting after you start traveling or if it shows you facing the wrong direction while you are moving please let us know.    If we can assist you further on this subject or any other Humminbird related questions please feel free email us again or contact our Customer Resource Center at 1-800-633-1468 to speak with a Customer Service Representative.

639385,Skipper D,2011-11-11 19:41:00,1970,Good ! That makes me like my humminbird better Paul .......... now i can sleep in peace...lol .
639424,mercman,2011-11-11 22:49:00,7054,"  Its a good sonar Skip.As good as any at that price for sure.I may just pick that up myself, to replace the lowrance on my bow."
637602,mike rousseau,2011-11-05 11:36:00,4661,It's just annoying that my 10 year old black and white gps(with external) out performed my current humminbird...  If internal doesn't work well... Why would they put it on the market?
637605,SlowPoke,2011-11-05 11:42:00,2984,"If they deem that level of accuracy ""acceptable"", one must wonder how accurate the sonar is. You might as well leave it demo mode."
637609,mercman,2011-11-05 12:07:00,7054,"  Exactly.We aren't rocket scientists.All we want is a safe accurate way to tell us where we are,where we are going,how to get back home, and how fast we are going. My automobile GPS is more accurate than my 587. both have internal antenna.I expected my Humminbird to be at least as accurate. At least when the car is parked, it says 0mph"
637610,manitoubass2,2011-11-05 12:16:00,11391,This doesn't really surprise me too much after doing some training last summer with a mining company/ontario government.  I was confused at how innaccurate our GPS co-ordinates could be/were. For 5 days I averaged about 6-8 metres off my locations(not very accurate)
637611,Billy Bob,2011-11-05 12:20:00,5865,"I gave up on Humminbird's toys long ago....  My Lowrance LMS 520C units both share one external puck antenna and it's accuracy is VERY good....HOWEVER, I do have water speed which I paid extra for...(the small paddle wheel on transom) WHY ???...Because when you're trolling in current your land speed and water speeds very a LOT and your walleye lures will spin if your going to fast.  Paul, if you satisfied with the Sonar readouts of the Humminbird then bite the bullet and purchase a external antenna...if not, remove unit and sell it and get yourself a Lowrance HDS unit....either way problem solved."
637615,dave524,2011-11-05 12:33:00,4508," If you got the same one I do Billy , been running one since before there was GPS, never could bring myself to hang a 300 dollar probe on a rigger cable. This combined with the angle of the dangle of the rigger cables, hum of the wires and the way the little bubbles break off the cable I do good enough on speed. There are even local to you. Mine is the Osprey model, it is even self powered unless you want the light.  http://www.moorelectronics.com/fishing/trolling/trolling.html"
637644,aplumma,2011-11-05 18:06:00,6896,Most of the GPS in a car have a program edit that will not let it read anything but 0 below 2 MPH or Metric Equal. GPS is a wonderful thing but to get the accuracy that people want would mean a really expensive receiver unit. To keep the costs down they sacrifice certain reality information with software parameters. Your Auto GPS does not really track your car on a map so accurate that it doesn't leave the road. They have a parameter that says chose the closest road and keep the car on their even if the GPS is off by X feet. The depth finder you use does not really read 10 ft 3 inches it reads 10ft going to 11ft but they have decided to relay that information to you as 10ft plus inches till it is 11ft etc. The best way to find your trolling speed is mechanical not electronic's your accuracy fluctuates with how many satellites are up their and what the angle of them are in relation to each other. You can make a mechanical trolling meter very easily using a string with a cylinder weight. hang it on a stick in the water and troll at the speed you want and check the angle of deflection from 6 o clock. Get a bite then mark it as the deflection and you can reset the boat at the same speed.   Art
637653,mercman,2011-11-05 19:14:00,7054," Ok, With all this new to me info, i can see how GPS in your car is great for getting you to a destination or finding gas stations and restaurants. But why do we even bother getting GPS on our boat if the accuracy level is so far off, that it is basically usless???? If the accuracy is so bad, then we really cant follow a depth contour,we could be 20-30feet off in either direction. We cant use it to navigate waters and avoid shallow areas, and we cant use it to troll acurately at a given speed. Why spend hundreds of dollars on naveonics cards if the machine we put them in, cant accuratley use the info on them I am so depressed now"
637656,GbayGiant,2011-11-05 19:38:00,1780,"MercMan, you say Lowrance has their problems. How many Lowrance units have you owned and what are the problems they have? I have had a few Lowrance units over the years and none have had any problems. I still have my old paper graph and x70 that still work quite well. Even my hand held h2o c works flawlessly. By the way. On charts and GPS maps it states to ""not to rely on for navigational purposes"". The maps are not perfect."
637657,SlowPoke,2011-11-05 19:40:00,2984, In colour no less!
637661,Roy,2011-11-05 19:59:00,13728,"I might be a little late with this but maybe you should have gotten a Lowrance? My LCX 25C works well and my old X-85, after all these years works flawlessly.  ps. Oh, disregard the above. Perhaps you should give Humminbird another crack at it. Hey, all the really good fishing dudes with those coloured shirts and sexy Humminbird logos all say they're the best they've ever used! C'mon Paul...buy another Humminbird. They already told you that they're aware of their limitations so it's only a matter of time before you're really somewhat happy with one."
637662,Woodsman,2011-11-05 20:31:00,1286,Last year I bought an obsolete but new in the box Humminbird 580. It has an external antenna & I find it quite accurate for speed & location using the provided UniMap or Navionics cards. Using either type of map places me in the water even when near shore. Have not found the need to use the map offset yet. Adjusting or confirming some settings in the unit may help your problems. Map datum - insure it's on the default setting of WGS 84 If running the tracking option set the distance & intervals to the lower values. With use of the map offset you should be reasonably close. What many forget is that for civilian use the receivers are designed to be only accurate to within +/- 10 metres 95% of the time and the US can downgrade the GPS signal anytime they choose for security reasons. That being said many/most units still perform far better than this standard.
637667,mercman,2011-11-05 20:56:00,7054,"  Well if what i am seeing here is true, it makes no differance at all what brand you buy, they are all innacurate.The technology is innacurate, period. Mine works fine too Roy.If it is a defective unit,i want it fixed. If its a problem that Humminbird is aware of, i want it fixed.If they do nothing i will take my propane torch and turn it into a door stop and buy a lowrance.Simple.  In answer to GBG, here are a few.Just type 'Problems with Lowrance"" into google, and get with the program bud. Both companies have thier share of problems.Whether you agree or not is neither here nor there The unit powers itself up when the boat is in storage or parked in the driveway. The backlight display is constantly turning on and off. It's like looking at a strobe. Lots of problems with lowrance transducers not being able to hold bottom at speeds much over 25mph. Sending back to Lowrance my third LGC-3000 antennal that has gone bad on my Globalmap 7300 HD GPS unit. Exactly the same symptoms: the unit works fine for a while, then, when powered up cannot find its location."
637676,Skipper D,2011-11-05 21:42:00,1970,"How ever which way its looked at ,technoligy can be hard on ya and in most case's shorten your life if your not careful , the dam cursed stuff ."
637681,aplumma,2011-11-05 22:10:00,6896,"Don't get me wrong GPS has lots of uses... It has the ability to get you back to an area that you visited last season and forgot that you caught fish their. It will allow you to troll the same line that you did repeating each pass thru the point you found. It allows you to plot a circuit to fish thru the day. What it can't do is get you to the pinpoint area due to physics. You are located by the triangulation of your position from space from up to 9 points. The closer or less amount of points the less accurate it is. The bright side is they can get you within 10ft most of the time all for around $500.00 with no monthly fee. What unit is best is up to what unit you read comfortable. I personalty after reading what does what and spending long hours on the water found that Lowrance reads the way that I understand the information and the controls it has to offer. It will take long hours of reading the information on the screen on the water and looking at the manual before you will even start to comprehend all of the features the little black box offers. To call the information that it does give you  valueless is incorrect it is actually invaluable to making a flat sheet of water rich with navigation aids, past memories, and the ability to mark it anytime you want.   Art"
637685,mercman,2011-11-05 22:25:00,7054," Thanks for that Art. I like my stuff to work properly.It allows me to put faith and trust in them.If the issue i am having is ""Normal"" then i will accept it and get on with life. If its not.....then huminbird will have no choice but to fix it. And believe me, they Will fix it.   Paul"
637690,Billy Bob,2011-11-05 22:53:00,5865,"   Your fishing PONDS compared to the Great Lakes......those units are for the birds...Lowrance is head & shoulders above the ""bird"" units...OK...I said it....so what..."
637711,GbayGiant,2011-11-06 00:20:00,1780," I got with the program years ago after buying my first Lowrance and have not had any issues since. Try not to believe everything you read in Google and go with experience instead. The problem with the transducers freezing over the winter is something that has been known for a while now. After market transducers will last longer than the units will. Just a heads up for you when it comes to transducer problems. As for the units not being accurate, they are bang on for Georgian bay for the most part but a good eye will help keep you out of trouble when off of the main channels which is something else that comes with experience."

637791,Big Cliff,2011-11-06 12:38:00,6899,"Well, I have had both Hummingbird and lowrance units, I currently own an HDS 5 and love it and I haven't had any problems with it other than messing up my settings a few times (my own fault).  As for accuracy, I figure that if it can get me within 20 or 30' of where I want to be, that is pretty good, my boat is only 18.5' long so if the GPS can put me within a boat length or so I have no issues. I have checked it out for accuracy on several occasions and found that within 10' is normal (1/2) a boat length!  As for speed, it seems to be pretty good but I haven't really had anything to really test it against. I do find that even when stoped it will fluctuate by .0 to .3 or .4 mph but when underway it seems to hold steady.  I hope Hummingbird comes through for you, it would sure be good business on their part!"

I know on my prehistoric Lowrance, it has several options of correction factors if the map or lake and GPS don't line up so you can manually correct it.  As for the unit indicating movement when you're standing still(that's a PQ thing, you guys always think you're going faster)although honestly, I think the unit should indicate zero ground speed.  I know mine will give fluctuating very low speed readings if I'm walking really slow or just slowly drifting with the boat.  If Humminbuzzard knows about the problem, then it's their problem.  Unless they advertized it as a crappy product without an external antenna, then they should at least ""give"" you the antenna.  Who pays for repairs if you run into a rockpile, I'm sure it's not in their parameters of things to do."
637537,aplumma,2011-11-05 00:21:00,6896,The external antenna being the answer indicates the one on the unit is not powerful enough to be accurate. I have 2 units one is internal and the other an external and the external does mark a little more accurately. The degree of accuracy on all of the units are within 20 ft usually. The dirty little secret between all of the units is the program of the units are told to read the nearest water. The GPS units for the car are also told to hold in the lines of the roads or nearest one possible. So basically if their units can't do what you ask no amount of complaining will make it exceed it's design capacity. The antenna while extra in cost is separate from the unit and increases it's designed capacity to what you want. Personally you will at best get to within 10ft of the actual mark. I have seen people who have a false belief that they can track back a route and miss the shoals up North after dark. It is just a game of Russian Roulette for sure.     Art
637541,mercman,2011-11-05 00:31:00,7054,"  Good point Art. I can live with the positioning thing.I can always set the map offset for each body of water i visit, but the speed issue is whats bothering me.When my boat is anchored or parked, it should be showing 0mph, not .8 to 2.6mph, and fluctuating this speed.If i want to precision troll for walleye for example, how do i know what speed i am doing?   Paul"
637545,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-05 00:39:00,10439, Not if you combine your mapping/GPS with a keen eye on your depth finder. A big freaking light doesn't hurt ether.
637547,Skipper D,2011-11-05 00:43:00,1970,"I own no GPS units , but can't help but think GPS means on the mark . I'd be upset if i own one such device and it did'nt do what i have come to believe they do do ."
637555,Twocoda,2011-11-05 01:20:00,4130,"your unit shouldnt be turned on when when the transducer is not in the water to be cooled off....who cares what it says when its on the trailer ....borrow someone elses handheld unit and make sure it is marking an identicle speed when you are fishing/moving ....if it works correctly when it supposed to be working ...then dont sweat it....if it isnt working correctly when its supposed to be then you response to them should be "" Im glad you aware of the reason this unit is the last i will purchase from your company"""
637556,mercman,2011-11-05 01:31:00,7054,"  I hear ya. Securely anchored on the water, same issue. Speed on boat speedometer indicates a faster speed than GPS, and my Bro, paced me in is Bass boat, and i was going faster than my GPS indicated.1-2 mph faster."
637559,mike rousseau,2011-11-05 01:47:00,4661,What happens is...  I'll be trolling a steady 5mph and the units on the screen jump between 3-7mph...  A lot of the time the speeds are correct... But the other day I was trolling 5+mph and for about 20 minutes it was saying a steady 3.5-4
637560,Twocoda,2011-11-05 01:52:00,4130,speedo on the boat will vary from the GPS due to currents of the water.....anchor could be dragging and your drifting ...
637567,mercman,2011-11-05 02:08:00,7054, Bingo.....exactly the same thing here too. I will keep you all posted on what Humminbird is doing to resolve this issue.

637574,esoxcrazy,2011-11-05 03:18:00,22,"Well the accuracy of the gps signals for civilian use has been a topic for many years.  There is only a few ways to help you map as accurate as possible:  The use of the external antennae is a must!  I run lowrance 520C with the external puck and the 522igps on the bow.  I also have my garmin hcx with the accuracy onscreen display.  The internal 522 is definetly not as accurate as the external reciever.  Having the accuracy of the waas reciever is a great piece of info that is gonna get you back on those ""spot on spot"" locations. You may need to hold off for the use of the european ""Galileo"" system that is expected to blow the american gps system out of the water! In 1999, the different concepts (from Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom) for Galileo were compared and reduced to one by a joint team of engineers from all four countries. The first stage of the Galileo programme was agreed upon officially on 26 May 2003 by the European Union and the European Space Agency. The system is intended primarily for civilian use, unlike the United States system, which the U.S. military runs and uses on a primary basis. The U.S. reserves the right to limit the signal strength or precision of GPS, or to shut down public GPS access completely, so that only the U.S. military and its allies would be able to use it in time of conflict. Until 2000, the precision of the signal available to non-U.S.-military users was limited (due to a timing pulse distortion process known as selective availability)"
637595,Gerry,2011-11-05 08:16:00,257,"Crazy is correct. GPS units, even with external antennas, are somewhat inaccurate in positioning and so it stands to reason that they will also be off when indicating low speeds. If you want precision at low speeds a GPS will not do it for you, especially worse with an internal antenna. If you want precision for trolling only a paddle wheel specially designed for this application will give that to you. I use this while trolling for walleye or salmon: Moore Subtroll."
