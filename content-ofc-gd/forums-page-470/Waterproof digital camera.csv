639168,ChrisK,2011-11-10 23:23:00,2772,Looking for a waterproof digital camera to carry around in my fishing vest. Any ideas which one will give me the best bang for my buck ??
639175,Remastered,2011-11-10 23:43:00,143,"There are a few at Best Buy / Futureshop, but most of the good ones don't have screens to show you what your recording. http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/category/sports-helmet-camcorders/25715.aspx?path=099ae705abbfa499f55f85a0fe62889aen01 I've had the helmet hero and I thought the quality was really impressive on high res."
639178,mike rousseau,2011-11-10 23:56:00,4661,I've had my Olympus for 3-4 years now... Good quality pics... And you can use it underwater... 200-250$ at Walmart....
639188,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 00:20:00,8333,I have a fuji FinePix XP10. It's small and is less than a $200.  http://www.fujifilm.ca/products/digital_cameras/xp/finepix_xp10/index.html

639203,spinnerdoc,2011-11-11 00:54:00,556,"I have the olympus Stylus and I'm really happy with it, dropped it a number of times and submerged too many times cant complain. Mine is the older one, my only complain is this model has the olumpus memory card(xd) which is limited to 2g but not really an issue bec. that can hold a good amount of fish pics, the real issue is I can't use my memory card from another camera.The newer ones I heard are gonna use standard memory cards like the rest."
639208,Guidofisherman,2011-11-11 01:03:00,206,This may help. http://forums.dprevi...mpactgrouptest/
639213,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-11 01:08:00,10439,Got one of the original Olympus Stylus 300's (water resistant but it's been dinked to 6' and lived) and an Olympus Stylus SW1050 (waterproof and have used it as such). Both still work fine after many years of service.  I have heard good things about the Panasonic Lumix cameras as well.
639245,fishnsled,2011-11-11 02:35:00,3520," Me too. So many good things I bought one tonight. A buddy of mine has one and has been very happy with it thus far. Check My link in the photography section as well. Was leaning towards the new Nikon but with the comments about them and the fact that the camera was just release, I opted for the Panasonic TS3. BTW - they are on sale at Henry's for $299."
639249,Remastered,2011-11-11 02:40:00,143,Nevermind. Thought I read camcorder not camera lol..
639260,scugpg,2011-11-11 03:25:00,1373,Best bang for the buck - Fuji XP series  Best Waterproof camera - Panasonic TS3 or Sony TX10
639266,timmeh,2011-11-11 03:59:00,609," I've got the same and am reasonably happy with it. Takes pretty decent picks, though it doesn't have the settings options of the more expensive cameras, if you're the type who likes to have those options. Really durable though. Mines been through the washing machine twice and still works fine."
639279,ChrisK,2011-11-11 09:51:00,2772,Thanx everyone for the informative replies. Will be going out next week to get my new camera
639322,BillM,2011-11-11 15:04:00,17367,"Chris, Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3!!!   Make sure you check it out!"
639323,bare foot wader,2011-11-11 15:23:00,1354,"x 2 on the panasonic, grabbed one myself recently, very happy  I'm slowly diving into dslr/learning photography past few years but basically, how the new nikon was explained to me is you could put a 500 hp in a ford focus but doesn't mean you're put that power to the ground...the nikon sounds impressive on paper but doesn't have a good enough sensor or something like that, so the picture quality is lacking unless under optimal conditions, not usually the case when you're fishing....the pics i've seen from that camera for definitely full of noise and grainy"
639362,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-11 18:07:00,655,"Best bang for the buck is the Kodak Sport at $79.95. Waterproof to 10-feet and my buddy that has one said it takes great photos.  It's at Future Shop right now for $69.99.  If you are looking for a higher quality waterproof camera, you may want to look at the Canon"
639380,OutdoorDan,2011-11-11 19:25:00,325,"I've had the Canon d10 for a while now and like it a lot.  It's waterproof to 30 feet and works well even in sub-zero temperatures.  Huge LCD screen for its size too, although it may be a little more bulky than what you are looking for.  It also *almost* floats - all I do is attach a little foamy (like on a boat key chain) onto the round clip in and floats.  Not being worried about dropping it over the side of the boat is awesome."
