I was actually in Protackle here in Belleville today looking to pick up a Bondy bait, but apparently some guy already cleaned him out. Seems like your lures are really getting popular and it's not hard to see why. Congrats on a day every musky guy dreams of!"
638477,cl_fishin,2011-11-08 17:11:00,138,"Great baits and great fishing Jon, WTG!!"
638536,bigbuck,2011-11-08 20:38:00,2449,Awesome!!! An 18 hit day for anyone is incredible never mind landing 14. There have to be some 50 inchers down there so time on the water will eventually pay off. Good for you!!!
638550,esoxansteel,2011-11-08 21:46:00,1307,"The secrets out and the bait is no secret anymore,   Jon you should have a disclaimer with those baits, as the hits are not for someone with a weak ticker"
638767,crappiehunter,2011-11-09 16:45:00,2,Nice
638790,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-09 18:32:00,655,That is an incredible day on the water! Congrats. Your client is spoiled in a very big way.
638213,Bondy,2011-11-07 23:01:00,40,"Took a very good client out today and in the am on the Detroit River, The two of us fished until 2:39 and hooked 18 landing 14, with the 3 biggest all being 48 inchers. Couldn't break the 50 inch mark. We started casting and had one come blasting out to eat a redhorse Meal Ticket. That was awesome. Then made one pass jigging Bondy's out in about 25 ft getting none. Moved to 15-17 ft and it fired up. Man they were eating good today. Had we had a 3rd rod out we would have had 20 I'm sure. I had one that I saw on the screen that was about 8-10 ft off the bottom, and I raised my jig up as far as I could do it. Holding on to the butt end of the handle pointing that tip sky high and that sucker ate it. By the time I set the hook she was at the top....what a day. Not an everyday occurance that's for sure. Here are some pics.... "
