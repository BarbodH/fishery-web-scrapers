Charles Weiss did this painting and called it ""sting the bling"" which he took from the Handlebarz catch phrase Zing the Bling.The print is available for sale and also its in his 2012 calendar its kinda cool having a painting done and not knowing about it until its done. I just had to share with eveyrone also have a look at his site he does some crazy work and great carvings.  http://www.charlesweissart.com/news.html  "

638700,Handlebarz,2011-11-09 10:55:00,3790,Thanks guys it was cool to find out that he did it I have a print of it already but am looking forward to see the calendar. One cool thing about his calendars is they are made so you can cut them up after the year and frame each print or just put them on display if ya like kinda like pin up girls for musky nuts.
