639102,Spiel,2011-11-10 16:55:00,9065,"Sorry Jon, no spares for that one here and you're right, not likely a repairable."
639105,camillj,2011-11-10 17:02:00,1988,"Oh well ... does anyone else hear a loud ""Katch-chinggg $$$$"" in the background ?  Probably have about 20 minutes for someone to make me an offer I can't refuse on their oh-so-special float rod (11' - 12') ... before I go SERIOUS (pre-christmas) shopping"
639106,Spiel,2011-11-10 17:04:00,9065,I know how easy it is to get attached to an old favourite but new rods are nice too.
639108,camillj,2011-11-10 17:07:00,1988,"Too true Chris .. still hoping to get on that waiting list for a ""SPIEL custom"" ... but for now I guess ... Le Baron's here I come !!!"
