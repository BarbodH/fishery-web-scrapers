Lest We Forget  In Waters Deep In ocean wastes no poppies blow. No crosses stand in ordered row. There young hearts sleep...beneath the wave... The spirited, the good, the brave, But stars a constant vigil keep, For them who lie beneath the deep. 'Tis true you cannot kneel in prayer On certain spot and think, ""He's there"". But you can to the ocean go... See whitecaps marching row on row; Know one for him will always ride... In and out... with every tide.  Eileen Mahoney  "

That's Dad on your right covered in coal dust after just coming out of the engine room.  His buddy beside him burned to death later on when the boiler exploded.    This was his ship.
