638978,scottyswing,2011-11-10 03:01:00,37,"Was at a local Conservation lake that has a variety of good fish. There is however a big sign as you go in that tells you the limit of each fish you can take home. (I'm sure you know where I'm talking about) Pike for instance, you are allowed to take two fish from the water.  The other day, while day fishing i watched two old guys take 6-7 pike EACH. When i asked him about it, he said he was told pike are a problem and are eating all the baby bass. He's not MNR though. So I'm not sure if i should be a little bit more of a dick next time i see it.  Would any of you say something? Or is it just the way it goes.  I've read on here that the size of pike in the water has been on the decline, and i assume the over fishing doesn't help.   Just want to know if i should point it out to people that the limit is two for a reason."
638995,Twocoda,2011-11-10 03:28:00,4130,i would/do say something all the time....sometimes people just dont know but other times they do know and are just jerks....
638996,northernpike56,2011-11-10 03:33:00,717,"yes, i know where we're talking about, and this is a common sight there... I would have been a jerk to them if they were ignoring me. They were probably using live bait too, right?"
638997,GBW,2011-11-10 03:34:00,8460,speak up as the MNR should know more then the average Joe
639001,kickingfrog,2011-11-10 03:39:00,8333,"If they take out all the pike the only thing left in there will be ""baby bass"" (stunted)."
639008,rocheleauc,2011-11-10 04:12:00,205,Personally I'd say something
639009,Pigeontroller,2011-11-10 05:17:00,2793,"As an ethical angler, I consider it my responsibility to say something!"
639010,Remastered,2011-11-10 06:30:00,143,"You don't even have to tell them anything if the fish are dead. Most people won't really consider what you say to them and since it is illegal, the best action would be to report them to the hotline."
639018,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-10 10:33:00,4399,"By all means be a ""dick"" us old guys love it when lugans are dicks!"
639020,Terry,2011-11-10 10:39:00,14456,"I say something, I snap pictures, I ask them to hold up the fish a shot I take pictures of their boat and numbers or their car..... and I tell them to drop the fish in the lake and leave or I will make sure they are charged.........  and so far I have lived to tell about it"
639021,fishindevil,2011-11-10 10:45:00,6254,"like terry says,take some pics..tell them you are reporting them...but yes i always say stuff as in usually too pissed off to contain myself,specially if they know what they are doing you can usually tell..."
639022,singingdog,2011-11-10 10:50:00,1047,"I wouldn't have said anything at all....just called the hotline. I get the same thing on a local stocked rainbow stream. I used to say something, but used to get the ""it's stocked, it's OK"" from one couple that consistently took double their limit. Now, it's pics of their license plate and a quick call to the hotline."
639043,NBR,2011-11-10 14:07:00,163,If I had my cell phone MNR would be called and information complete with car description and license number. The rules are to protect the fishery for all and not to be applied selectively.

639086,mike rousseau,2011-11-10 15:56:00,4661,thats like the people on the st.lawrence that have in the past and still kill pike... rockbass... sunfish...  another lake i know of... they would kill musky cause the locals prefered largemouth bass fishing...  these people are usually uneducated and dont realize the damage they can do to a water system...  a hefty fine from the MNR will educate em pretty fast...  i have the hotline on my phone...  in my area... ive seen them show up to a hotline call in 5-10 minutes... if they are close by... they will show up...
639092,johnnyb,2011-11-10 16:08:00,3413,"From what you wrote, Scotty, it doesn't sound like they were necessarily being dicks.  I would most certainly start by pointing the sign out to them...let them know it's clearly posted.  If they don't throw fish back, you don't need to inform them that you're calling TIPS....just call. Being a dick to them is just situation-dependent, IMHO.  Sometimes you need to, sometimes you don't.  Calling TIPS is a no-brainer though....always make the call"
639170,northernpike56,2011-11-10 23:29:00,717,if everybody keeps all the pike from there then the crappie and bass populations will explode and become stunted  I would rather catch some pike and a few big crappies then tonnes of tiny fish
639221,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 01:41:00,8333," Ya it becomes the self fulfilling prophecy. They remove too many top predators and the other game fish stunt, so they remove more pike etc."
639382,OutdoorDan,2011-11-11 19:29:00,325,"As if the reason they are doing it for matters, lol."
