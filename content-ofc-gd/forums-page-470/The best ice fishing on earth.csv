639495,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-12 12:10:00,2582,:thumbsup_anim:    BRING ON THE ICE      :thumbsup_anim:  Thx for posting that. I had a day once on Scugog ice where I got an insane amount of walleye. Stupid numbers. I actually came off the ice before the real good evening bite because I had just plain had enough. 14-19 inch clones one after another.  I can only imagine a day like that hauling in the brutes in this video.  Now you have done it  ....when I finish my morning coffee you have FORCED me to start to get my ice gear organized for the season.  jds63 you are evil
639498,Jds63,2011-11-12 12:59:00,1365," :thumbsup_anim:    , my buddy sent me that link and , yeah I figured this video would get the ice anglers pumped, doubt i would ever get lakers that big one after another down here but did have a day like you mentioned a few years back where we caught 20 lakers before noon on a lake 2 hours north of T.O , but they would all have been dinner for the ones in the video"
