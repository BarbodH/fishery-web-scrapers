639302,bubbles,2011-11-11 13:26:00,591,"The faceoff should have been in the other end, the DOG was caused by TB not fore checking.  What a pathetic excuse for a tactic, not hockey at all. I coach minors and we are constantly on them to chase the puck and gain possesion, hopefully they were not watching this crap."
639304,Mike Pike,2011-11-11 13:48:00,1332,"I'd be in favour of ANYthing that stops teams from trapping.  If I had to endure another decade of watching teams trap their way to the Stanley Cup, I'd stop watching.  I applaud Philly for bringing it to light( and believe me, I HATE Philly ).  If it was up to me, I'd have a rule where Tampa would get 2 minutes for 'lack of aggression.'"
639306,Harrison,2011-11-11 13:57:00,2202,"I liked it.  I hate trap hockey personally, exact opposite of how I was taught the game and enjoy playing it."
639326,K_F,2011-11-11 15:27:00,107, Tampa went to the third round last year jersey won a couple cups
639419,canada414,2011-11-11 22:20:00,40," but then St. Louis would have gotten a break-away,"
639425,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-11 22:49:00,0,i don't like the trap but it's a legitimate hockey strategy.  the best way to get rid of it is to render it ineffective with short passes or chips off the boards and counter it with good ol' fore check. standing around just makes laviolettte and the flyers look like attention whores to me.
639426,misfish,2011-11-11 22:56:00,29133, Oh that brings back the way we were coached. It worked very well.IMO

639190,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 00:23:00,8333, What did Doug have to say?   BTW that's a great white north reference.
639193,fishforfun,2011-11-11 00:34:00,105,"Under Hockey Canada rules, the delay of game rule for not moving the puck was removed some time ago. A defenseman or any other player can let the puck sit motionless for as long as he likes. You are not delaying the game because the clock is still running. DOG is defined as causing unnesessary stoppages or refusing to allow play to resume. If you can find the NHL rule that calls this DOG I would be most interested in reading it."
639195,GBW,2011-11-11 00:40:00,8460,there are no real DOG's on the ice in the NHL but some players play like them...
639196,Rizzo,2011-11-11 00:43:00,4754,interesting move by the flyers. hadn't seen that before
639197,Fisherman,2011-11-11 00:48:00,7201,"Is that like letting your floating Rapala sit idle in the water hoping a big fish will come by when you're not cranking it in.  If so, then I'll do that, Delaying of Biting."
639199,fishforfun,2011-11-11 00:51:00,105,"Lightening are playing the trap. Teaching systems such as the trap remove a players ability to be creative, Orr, Gretzky etc. Bad for the game in the minds of those who control it."
639200,misfish,2011-11-11 00:54:00,29133," The trap is not new to the game. Ya the bolts did not attack,but the flyers did nothing but stand there. DOG.  They could of atleast,past the puck back and forth."
639205,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 00:57:00,8333,"“Tampa Bay Lightning are chipping away at our escrow 1-3-1 at a time,” Phoenix Coyotes forward Paul Bissonnette tweeted."
639209,bigugli,2011-11-11 01:03:00,6138,sad excuse for hockey. Can the spectators get a refund?
639217,fishforfun,2011-11-11 01:24:00,105,"Misfish the trap is not new to the game, but playing systems only began in the 90's. It is killing creativity and boring the viewer. Philly could have challenged but they have been taught not to, maintain a 1-3-1 force the other team to make a mistake. Well the other team was saying not gonna happen. This was bound to happen sooner or later and it throws the game flow back in the NHL's court. If the game doesn't flow with speed passing and hits= boring. The call by the ref in my opinion was wrong, the play if whistled dead should have gone to center ice the offending team should have been warned and the next time you have this (for GBW) Delay Of Game. Who was delaying the game? If Pronger holds the puck for 20 mins, fastest period in hockey history. If Philly doesn't attack DOG?"
639219,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 01:27:00,8333,Anyone notice the resemblance to soccer?
639222,Cookslav,2011-11-11 01:44:00,1457," Yup...funny you say that cause I was thinking it. Except nobody was rolling clutching there knee for no apparent reason  I think I'd be inclined to call it a delay, but in reality the official did the right thing blowing it dead and giving the bench a bit of ""advice"" on the play."
639227,bigugli,2011-11-11 01:53:00,6138,Pull that kind of stunt at an NFL Sunday game and heads would roll.
639231,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 02:06:00,8333,"The fans want entertainment. The coaches want, make that need, wins. The two do not always go together."
639235,Grimace,2011-11-11 02:09:00,2020,It is Peter Laviolette's way of calling out Guy Boucher.   The 1-3-1 is boring at the best of times but to not send 1 single forchecker past the blue line is ridiculous.   This is not hockey.   The trap is bad enough but I do not recall any trap system not having at least 1 forchecker.   The first '1' in Guy Boucher's 1-3-1 is actually in between the red line and blue line.   Brutal.   I strongly dislike the Philadelphia Flyers but I am with Laviolette on this one.
639237,fishforfun,2011-11-11 02:16:00,105,"The head that would roll would be the the QB or anyone in posession of the ball, Foot ball and soccer references here are simply apples to oranges."
639239,danc,2011-11-11 02:20:00,4677,What a pathetic way to promote the game in the southern US where markets are struggling to begin with. Do they think that people are gonna pay a small fortune to come and watch that?
639244,Grimace,2011-11-11 02:31:00,2020,"  In Tampa, it is cheaper than going to a movie.   lol."
639246,misfish,2011-11-11 02:36:00,29133,"  I wouldnt know Grim,but that was funny as crap."
639247,kickingfrog,2011-11-11 02:37:00,8333,Ohh the notebook or a tampa game? I'd think about offing myself.
639253,misfish,2011-11-11 02:55:00,29133,Nice to see the Leafs dont use the trap or DOG.
