638509,Paulus,2011-11-08 19:07:00,522,"I recently got a chance to fish with Solopaddler and Drifter16 who was visiting our part of the country, to take in the “summer”-like coniditions (those NWT guys are used to some pretty cold temps!)  . Our target were some Georgian Bay tributaries that had had a recent dose of rain. The EPIC CHROME SLAUGHTER that we expected never really materialized, but there were definitely enough fish around to make a decent go of it. The motherlode was definitely out there, but we never lucked into it.   All fish were bright, energetic and a little on the small side (from a Lake Ontario steelhead perspective), and, although we didn’t get quite the quantity we expected, we got into them fairly consistently throughout the day.  As usual, laughs and chortles were pretty much non-stop throughout the day, so we did get the motherlode as far as that’s concerned,   and that’s usually the whole point anyway. If you can’t enjoy yourself, you won’t have a good day – no matter how many fish you drag to the bank!  I’ve included a lot of doubles, hopefully for your viewing pleasure .                          p.-"

638524,solopaddler,2011-11-08 20:07:00,8605,"Was good to get out with you guys and some chrome therapy was just what Dave needed I think.            Looking forward to tomorrow buddy, I sense a good day."

638535,Harrison,2011-11-08 20:38:00,2202,Thanks for sharing!
638543,misfish,2011-11-08 21:27:00,29133,Nice fish there guys.
638544,jpfishing,2011-11-08 21:31:00,53,Nice pcs thanks for updates! a
638554,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-08 22:02:00,10439,Yeah it was nice to get out. Would have been better under different circumstances though. It's riding the sled and drilling holes from here on out for me now though. 1st ice fishing trip of the year is planned for this weekend.  It was good to see you guys again. Take it easy and poke some chromers for me will ya?
638575,Victor,2011-11-08 23:25:00,1609,"I was expecting to see pics of Drifter16 in t-shirt & shorts  Nice fish guys! I have been sooo tempted to pick up one of those reels, don't know how much longer I can resist ..."
638578,solopaddler,2011-11-08 23:27:00,8605,"  They're truly beautiful, maybe the nicest reel I've ever fished."
638582,frozen-fire,2011-11-08 23:47:00,542,Can't beat fresh Georgian Bay steel. Great pics.
638652,corvette1,2011-11-09 02:26:00,1765,great day on the water guys
638655,backbay,2011-11-09 02:29:00,773,"Indeed, nice chrome and nice gear to boot!"
638682,Victor,2011-11-09 05:10:00,1609," Hearing that from you, is making it even harder and harder to hold myself back. haha maybe I will wait till Christmas rolls around and buy myself a xmas gift."
638684,solopaddler,2011-11-09 05:14:00,8605,"  You don't just ""buy"" a DeMarco. You place an order with Adam then unless you're very lucky, wait very patiently 'till your reel arrives. Sometimes the wait can be long."
638685,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-09 05:28:00,10439, Or you can just buy Mike's when he puts it up for sale. I don't think he's ever held onto one for too long.
638754,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-09 16:05:00,655,Very nice chrome  I never tire of viewing chrome reports. I've had some good days fishing that trib. Man did the lake look rough!
639054,l2p,2011-11-10 14:55:00,346,"Gotta love a fishing trip with good friends... looks like you guys had a blast, thanks for sharing!"
