638812,msp,2011-11-09 19:54:00,1336,I need to put on sunglasses to read your reports. Definetly a fun way to catch steelies. I prefer to use Kwikfish when throwing hardware. Good job guys !
638844,misfish,2011-11-09 21:48:00,29133,"Mike, Im going to bring my spinning gear with me next time. You had me thinking all day about this post. I have a few spots that I want to see if the spinner will out do the float.   Some real nice fish pics here guys."
638846,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-09 21:49:00,0,i never leave home without my lucky black and blue spoon.  when the fish are high in the water column especially it just seems like nothing fishing like hardware.
638850,dobee,2011-11-09 21:52:00,301,Always happy to be your cameraman mike! hardware was unreal... i shouldnt have left the hardware rod in the car!!
638853,SirCranksalot,2011-11-09 22:23:00,3291,"Solo(Mike),  I,m really glad to see your post. I'm just getting into 'bows and the only success I've had has been with lures, but I've seen so many(the vast majority) using roe that I became convinced that was the  way to catch them with any kind of consistency. So, as I mentioned elsewhere, I have been so far frustrated with roe. I think now lures will be my first choice and maybe use roe if that's not working. My limited luck has been on Little Cleos an 5 of diamonds.  I wonder why you use such a strong leader(12#). The roe folks seem to all use light (4-6#) leaders and still manage to land big fish. Allso, wouldn't a lighter braid be easier to cast i.e cast further?"
638873,esoxansteel,2011-11-09 23:12:00,1307,"Nice report Mike, been arking custom colorados through the runs for may years, if conditions are right, and yes the strikes are incredible, also enjoy bringing out the fly rod, and free drifting the runs as well with both roe and colorados as well, nice to take a step back in time, to remember how we used to catch chrome before long rods and pins"
638882,Twocoda,2011-11-09 23:49:00,4130, For the float set ups ....presemntation is essential hence the reason for the fine lines to try to mimic a natural flow of a fly or roe bag as it would if it wasnt attached to a leader...if you get snagged on the bottom your out a hook or two amounting to under a dollar  Chucking lures....the lure is the presentation with its ability to wiggle or make noise what ever the case may be  so the heavy line is to aid in getting off the bottom if you get snagged...lures cost ten bucks or so...it gets costly quickly....i normally run 10 pound tezt on my spinning reel( 10'6 rod) and 17 on my baitcaster ( 7' rod)...  Did i mention the RIVER is my tackle box.....  edit to add: im going to guess Mike runs heavy braid so he can be more versatile to target other species should the need arise

638961,solopaddler,2011-11-10 02:19:00,8605,"  Was a pleasure fishing with you bud, thanks for adding your pic's. Too bad about this week, it's on fire right now. Next time    Braid may be a liability if you were using an extreme fast action rod. With a rod that has a ""bit"" of softness in the tip though it's no problem believe me.  Braid has obvious advantages as far as hook sets and sensitivity goes...you can feel everything.  It's also simply more durable.  This particular type of fishing is pretty darned close to a saltwater experience in my books.  Big water, hot aggressive fish, arm wrenching strikes.... I had 3 steelhead in the 10lb range chase my spoon right to my feet today before one just walloped it.  Mono would simply not stand up to the abuse believe me. Unless you were using really heavy gorrila stuff, but then you wouldn't be able to cast as far.  If it was one or two fish then maybe, but I put 50 fish on the bank the other day and lost almost as many LOL!    Looking forward to getting out with you again Joe!    It's a 100% reaction strike, no finesse whatsoever. I'm fairly confident I could get as many fish running straight braid. The 12lb fluoro tippet probably does nothing more than give me confidence."
639023,singingdog,2011-11-10 10:59:00,1047," That would be my guess. If they are that aggressive, the flouro is probably overkill....but it's hard to argue with 50 landed steelhead"
639065,l2p,2011-11-10 15:10:00,346,"Way to be versatile! Nice fish, reminds me of this one time earlier this fall. Was fishing a large pool but the water was gin clear, you could see every fish in there. I was getting by using 3 lb lead and singles but after every fish id hook the pool would shut down for 20 min or so... then this older gent came up and started casting little brass spinners, almost every cast 5-10 fish would stray from the pod and follow with most striking short or ""tasting"" his lure. He hit 3 fish from that pool and was on his way... it was an awesome sight to see considering the fish were absolutely spooked from the morning bite."
639109,tonyb,2011-11-10 17:09:00,1637, Thanks for the response  Tony
639184,SirCranksalot,2011-11-11 00:14:00,3291," Snidley, I'm not sure what you mean by 'blade only' spinners. Would you mind explaining it a wee bit?  I googled backbouncing and I get the impression it's big on the West coast with deep waters and very big fish but the deepest river water I fished is about 15 ft, so it's probably too shallow for that technique.   "
639263,Snidley,2011-11-11 03:34:00,620,"Blades are similar to spinner rigs for walleyes. You put a spinner blade  through a clevis directly on your line and add a hook or tie on a pre made spinner rig like the Luhr Jensen ones or Hildebrandt ones (they are by far the best). You then use weight up the line, often off a 3 way swivel, to get the bait down to the fish. The current of the river will make the spinner rotate but the rig will not hang up on bottom like a weighted spinner ie. a Mepps/Blue Fox. They are often run off of baitcast floatrods which is the way I used them at places with high fast flow like the Grand, Whirlpool and Saugeen (when its high). The same sort of rig with a spin and glow instead of a metal spinner is good when you want less spinner vibration or the water is lower/slower/clearer. Personally I never use bait but you can put small roe bags, plastics etc on the hook (always a siwash or octapuss in my case (it's easier on the fish and does not hang up like a treble))and that adds to the appeal of the bait as you swing it.  In most rivers 15 feet IS deep. When I used to wade rivers I  backbounced Bronte Creek using small crankbaits like Rebel Crickhoppers and Big Ants with 3 split shots 18 inches above the lures. Worked like a charm but most days you will find it hard to fish busy urban rivers around the floaters using this technique as the two are basically incompatible."
639344,asdve23rveavwa,2011-11-11 16:15:00,2690,"Great stuff Mike!!!!!  I've only been out twice so far, but, have stayed away from the river...tossing hardware at the rivermouths.  Like you said, nothing beats the strikes.  First time out, was using my old school Trilene XT, 8 lb set-up.  Last time out, had my Pflueger Arbor 7450 (similiar to your US Reel) loaded with 30 lb braid, and a flouro leader. First time I've fished bows with braid...I'm a believer, definitely won't be the last time!!!"

639403,landry,2011-11-11 21:32:00,1005,"Thanks for the great post and especially for not naming the water you are fishing. I like fishing stories and reports - I just think advertising the location with a title like ""went 20 for 30"" is a bad idea. I used to laugh at people who photoshopped the background out of the picture but now I think it is the right thing to do - my opinion. If I want to show and tell on the internet, I am cautious not to ruin other people's fishing spots/plans by inviting everyone and their brother down the next day. Those are some nice chromies. Landry"
639406,T.Barry,2011-11-11 21:41:00,24,"Well not like the word is not out on how well that river is fishing this year anyways, but pretty easy to tell were they are from those pics no need to mention names if you have fished around the great lakes."
639410,BillM,2011-11-11 21:56:00,17367,That's the Catt.  The NYS steelhead fishery is doomed!  
639416,misfish,2011-11-11 22:17:00,29133,  Is the fishing good there Bill? Long drive to get nadda. 
638617,solopaddler,2011-11-09 01:18:00,8605,"As most of you know I love floatfishing with a long light rod and centrepin reel, but there are times when other methods shine.  For the last month I've had an absolute blast swinging spinners and spoons for hot aggressive steelhead.  When I say swinging, I mean that literally. I'm making long casts quartering downstream. Engaging the reel, and swinging the lure on a tight line with rod tip held high through the drift below. Sometimes I reel slowly, sometimes not, instead simply popping and fluttering the lures, especially the spoons, through the strike zone.  The strikes are unbelievably savage. Twice recently I've had fish snap my 20lb braid on the strike.  Speaking of braid that's an important part of the entire system. I'm running a long 11' spinning rod with lots of backbone. It's rated 6-10lb and most of the flex is in the top third of the rod with tons of power in the butt. This is necessary for casting distance, setting the hook and of course sensitivity.  The reel is an oversized US Reel Supercaster filled to the brim with as mentioned 20lb braid. On the terminal end I'm running 4-5' of 12lb fluoro to a tiny ball bearing snap then my lure.  With water temperatures still optimal and the fish being fresh from the lake and aggressive this method of angling is incredibly effective.  Most days totally outfishing the float guys.  For those who refuse to broaden their steelheading horizons by sticking solely with float gear, well simply put you're missing the boat.  This is an exhilerating way to catch these incredible fish. The strikes alone will leave you breathless...                                           Just to be different I've also caught a bunch of these guys as well, mostly floatfishing with beads (Just thought I'd throw that one in there  )     Get out while the gettin's good boys!"
638624,craigdritchie,2011-11-09 01:29:00,1586,Pretty old-school fishies!
638625,Twocoda,2011-11-09 01:35:00,4130,"ive said for years....but people dont think they look kewl without the bling of a centerpin....lol...even though most of them dont know how to use them...another great report Mike....i always get asked ""whats with the redneck fishing gear"" from some of the younger regulars when i show up with my spinning gear....and alot of the time they get to WATCH...why i showed up with that gear....after all ....it wasnt like they were doing anything anyways  if there was ONE lure in the world that i had to commit to ...it would be the original rattlin rap...steelies just cant say no regardless of the water conditions  Cheers"
638626,Rod Caster,2011-11-09 01:36:00,5784,Great stuff Mike! Mepps long cast is my favorite lure for large trout.
638627,MJL,2011-11-09 01:36:00,2427,"Very cool Mike...I've also noticed that the majority of my fish the last 2 weekends have come to hardware (spinners & Kwikfish) or large flies on the swing. With steelhead, there's nothing like the feeling of a big, bright steelhead pounding a spinner...It's like hooking a snag that jumps and goes ballistic"
638628,misfish,2011-11-09 01:38:00,29133,"Oh my, back flash.LOL  Real nice fish there Mike.   That spool looks dang short for long casting.  Again,real nice fish bud."
638634,Remastered,2011-11-09 01:49:00,143,"Those are some nice fish. Yes, I also think you can catch more fish throwing hardware than floatfishing. When they won't touch bait, a lure to trigger their instincts gets the job done. The bar for floatfishing has been set really high and with mixed results from so many anglers. I'm actually a bit surprised more people don't take advantage of the fish catching potential of lures. There are so many to choose from for steelhead. BTW that spoon seems interesting. Is it glow in the dark?"
638635,Eazy,2011-11-09 01:50:00,260,"NICE!  .....Like that spoon, found that orange and white works good for steelies!"
638640,solopaddler,2011-11-09 01:56:00,8605,"Thanks gents!      Brian, Brian, Brian...it's not length that's important, it's girth.   The spool on the Supercaster is incredibly wide. Much wider than any of the so called ""long cast reels"" with their longer more tapered spools.  The coils of line that come off it are huge.  Another reel that's similar and not bad either is the Pfleuger Arbor.  In order to optimize casting distance guides are important as well. If your first guide is either too close to the reel or more commonly simply not big enough, it's going to choke the line coming off the reel and reduce distance.  You're looking at at least 25"" from first guide to your foregrip and at least a #30 guide if you want to do things properly...  The ultimate spinning reels for long casting are likely some of the super high end euro carp reels. I aint gonna spend $700 on a spinning reel unless I win the lottery though."
638641,solopaddler,2011-11-09 02:01:00,8605,"  Floatfishing done properly will still catch more fish in the long haul, no doubt about that.  But...at certain times of the year and on certain river throwing hardware wins hands down.  Good eye on the lure, it is indeed a glow spoon."
638642,ketchenany,2011-11-09 02:09:00,3229,"I'd like to send you and article by John Kerr on the ""The Spinnerman"" OOD April '99, a good friend of mine. A real good read and brings back lot of memories, pm me your email, it's a hoot to read. Solo, great looking fish."

638658,northernpike56,2011-11-09 02:44:00,717,I had a steelie (I think) slam my monster 5 of diamonds spoons while fishing for pike in lake O. He instantly broke my 10 lb braid and went crazy jumping trying to shake the lure from his mouth. They are sooo much fun on hardware!
638679,Remastered,2011-11-09 04:29:00,143,"They seem to hit just as hard even in rivers. It's possible they are aggressive fish, but they hold back a lot due to their instincts. On that note, I'm pretty confident people can have better days with hardware if there is enough water to cover. I'd say it's an easy way to learn."
638703,fishindevil,2011-11-09 11:17:00,6254,awesome fall steel mike !!! those spinners look cool...some very nice trout for sure

638730,elusive,2011-11-09 14:07:00,77,mmmmmm...very tempted to bring along a spinnin combo out with me from now on!
638732,torco,2011-11-09 14:27:00,656,"Great report and its so true, to catch fish one needs to be versatile. Agree with most that float fishing will probably catch the most steelhead over the long run but something about the strike when casting a lure that can't be beat."
638733,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-09 14:29:00,655,"Awesome chrome Mike! I really like this post. Although I floatfish a lot, I also cast hardware at times, spring, fall and winter. There are times hardware definitely 'shines'   The hits are always incredible compared to watching a float drop.  I immensely enjoyed getting out with you recently casting hardware. That one steelie that hit so hard it snapped my line was the hardest hit I've ever had in the 33 years that I've been steelhead fishing!  I would love to get out with you again this week, but I'm gone almost 12 hours a day for work Mon-Fri and they will not even give me one day off, I asked   I like Joey's idea about calling in and telling work that ""I caught something""      "
638742,Snidley,2011-11-09 15:22:00,620,"If you like catching Steelies using hardware on a spinning outfit try hardware and cranks using a baitcaster. It's twice the fun because the sensitivity of the baitcaster allows you to feel the spinner spin or spoon/crank wobble and that not only sets you up for an exciting result when the salmon/steelie or even laker nail it but feeling the movement of your lure in detail will train you to reel in or backbounce at the optimal speed which can be a key to success. Personally I use a 7'11"" one piece heavy baitcater for Chinnooks and a 9'6"" med-light baitcaster for Steelies/Lakers. I use Fenwick Technas but they don't make them in long styles anymore however St Croix Avids are a very good product in those configurations and not too expensive either. Those new Rapala R Type 11' baitcasters rated to 14lb line that Aaron mentioned might be good too if you can ever find them at local shops. Rapala has not had great distribution for these rods around here. For deeper water lure anglers around here would do well to learn how to utilize backbouncing lures using weight to get the lure down to the fish and current to impart action to the lure. I have had steelies hit my Bagley's B Flat crankbait so hard backbouncing the Whirlpool that they have broken the lure off leaving me to reel in the lip only. In snaggy situations (like the Whirlpool)using spin and glows or ""blade only"" spinners can be cost effective as well as successfull too."
638747,thalweg,2011-11-09 15:42:00,112,Awesome!
638799,tonyb,2011-11-09 19:19:00,1637,"Incredible showcase of what seperates good anglers from great ones!  Nicely done solopaddler & Aaron.  The beauty about Steelhead is that there is such a WIDE range of techniques and baits that can fool them, and no one method is really better than another.  The key is being able to identify what is working best on a given system/day and applying it with success which you guys so clearly demonstrate.  The other thing is sometimes it's just more fun to catch them in a different way...why not try something different for a change?  EXCELLENT catching lads, hardware fooled fish are more rewarding any day    Question for you...Why do you prefer braid for this application?  I've always considered the no-stretch property of braid as more of a liability than mono on the initial strike.  Although it is obviously more sensitive than mono, it's not like you'll miss a steelhead strike, on the swing  Thanks in advance. Tony"
