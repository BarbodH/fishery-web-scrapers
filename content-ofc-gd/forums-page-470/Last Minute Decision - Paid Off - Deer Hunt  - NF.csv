Sorry no pics since we killed late yesterday afternoon and came back out of the bush well after sunset.  Pics were taken by our friend on his cell phone and when I receive them via email, will post them.  Keep reading and you'll understand  The location we hunt in, is in a gulley / valley type along the one side, a steep mountain... in the bottom, it's full of pine trees and swampy, on top, a section, is all hard wood and sort of flat    but to get there, it's a real pain climbing a steep hill, so we positioned ourselves in the gulley, on each side of it, at opposite ends, since deer will at some point visit to hide in (mostly at sunset).  The weather was excellent this weekend, with clear sky's and moderate winds and temps dropping below zero at night   First morning and snow had fallen, making it all white but during the afternoon, it melted, making it nice and comfy with above zero temps  To make a long story short, Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning, I heard  cracking noise, in front of me at the top of the mountain, so is my brother, and from where we were positioned, no way to see what caused it.... Had a suspicion it was a deer but could not confirm  Well Sunday, late afternoon, that suspicion was confirmed    The plan was for my brother and friend do a chase on top of the mountain while I sit in the blind, positioned down in the gorge and see if they could push a deer my way.  Best decision we ever made    So we proceeded... I got in position and waited while they climbed up the mountain.  Not 15 minutes went by and hear a cracking sound    No worries... it was my brother going by     Then a few second later I hear a gun shot BANG  This is when I reach for my two way radio and wait... I then hear my brother say ""Jacques, viens-t'en nous rejoindre.... monte en face d'la cache pit tu vas nous trouver...""  To translate for our none French members ""Jacques, come and meet us... climb up the mountain in front of the blind and you'll find us""  So I proceeded to leave the blind, my back pack full of gear and tackle my ascension...  Took a good 20 minutes to reach the top but couldn't see them.  So I use my radio to locate them.... once arrived at destination, laying sideways, was a nice buck    A spike   My brother was real happy  So now, the fun part past us, came the work part.... the gutting and the dragging  Our friend ask, do we have a rope and a bag??? Nope I replied!!! it's in my back pack in the deer blind down in the gorge   He says, it's all good, will have to put the liver and kidneys in my vest pockets    So he did  By then, I look at my watch and it's 4h45pm, not much day light remaining... up on top, you could see for miles but looking down in the gulley, it was getting dark  Our friend says to me ""Jacques, take the riffles and follow us""   I don't know about you but carrying 3 riffles going down a steep hill was quite a challenge and not to mention that I was dressed in multi layers to sit in a blind while they did the chase.... so by the time we got the deer next to the blind, it was pitch dark and all of us, was soaking wet from the hard work  There's more that follows but I'm affraid I'd be typing for ever  We got to our friends place around 6h15pm and celebrated our efforts with a nice cold beer, then we hung our guess outside to cool him down, finished cleaning him, removed the tender loins  The ultimate treat for hunters    The spike is guesstimated @ around 110Lbs, field dressed.  Got back home late last night.... happy to be back with a successful hunt.  Next weekend going back for more... hope to get to use my tag for another  Forgot to mentioned that a 12 pointer was spotted by locals going into the gulley... that in itself has my blood pumping for next weekend  Hope the story make sense!!!

638428,K_F,2011-11-08 14:55:00,107,congrats Jacques - keep up the good work
638434,wallyboss,2011-11-08 15:23:00,1095,"Congrats Jacques,  nothing like a tenderloin and liver snack. Sure makes all that hardwork worthwhile.   I had a story similar to that 6 years ago and the first thing that I did when I got to the truck all sweaty and totally exhausted was light up a cigarette. I loooked at the cigarette and said that there was something wrong with this. And decided right there and then that I was done with smoking, and I am still off of them."
638573,rocheleauc,2011-11-08 23:17:00,205,congrats and good work  sounds like a good time.
638673,Leecher,2011-11-09 03:34:00,7832," Thanks Cliff!!! LOL The little bit of dragging I did at the end was all on adrenaline... just wanted to see Mr. Buck get to the truck safely   Thanks Chad!!!  It sure is    Had I not have so many layers on, would of made the trip up and down that steep hill a little easier for me Just got word from my friend that a 6 & 8 pointer was spotted on the property   Saturday morning can't come soon enough   Thanks Corvy!!!  I'll give it my best   Thanks K_F!!!  I sure will   Thanks Dan!!!  Had the tenderloins tonight with my brother and they tasted great    After having Mr. Buck out of the bush and in the truck, the thought of a cigarette never came to mind... All I could think of was a nice cold beer   Thanks CJR!!!  ********* Photo Update *********  Got a pic in the mail tonight from my friend's daughter that she took Sunday with her cell phone... not the greatest shot but you can see the happy hunters and Mr. Buck    And the infamous hunters dream meal    Tight lines Leechman"
