A bombardier with a horse artillery battery, thrown into the gap left by the zouaves during the first gas attack at Wipers. He got a gong for his efforts, but rarely talked of it. My Uncle Matti, killed at the age of 16 during the Talvisota against the Russians. My father in law, Alf Conley, a surgeon with the RCMC, attached to the GGFG through the liberation of Europe. Uncle Harry, a CPO, lifer with the RCN. Carrier service from beginning to end. The cadets at Valcartier, 1974. I knew some of the survivors, and they were never the same again. My cousin Eric, a lifer PO recently retired from the RCN. Spent 3 years bouncing around the Serbian countryside setting up Canadian outposts  I cannot name the thousands I have known, and respect, who have served their country unselfishly through both World Wars, Korea, peacekeeping and in peace. Time and space will not allow. All too many with a scar that never truly heals. Each one a hero in his own right."

We are the dead: Short days ago, We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved: and now we lie In Flanders fields!  Take up our quarrel with the foe To you, from failing hands, we throw The torch: be yours to hold it high If ye break faith with us who die, We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields  Composed at the battlefront on May 3, 1915 during the second battle of Ypres, Belgium  On May 2, 1915, John McCrae’s close friend and former student Alexis Helmer was killed by a German shell. That evening, in the absence of a Chaplain, John McCrae recited from memory a few passages from the Church of England’s “Order of the Burial of the Dead”. For security reasons Helmer’s burial in Essex Farm Cemetery was performed in complete darkness. The next day, May 3, 1915, Sergeant-Major Cyril Allinson was delivering mail. McCrae was sitting at the back of an ambulance parked near the dressing station beside the YserCanal, just a few hundred yards north of Ypres, Belgium.   As John McCrae was writing his In Flanders Fields poem, Allinson silently watched and later recalled, “His face was very tired but calm as he wrote. He looked around from time to time, his eyes straying to Helmer's grave.""  Within moments, John McCrae had completed the “In Flanders Fields” poem and when he was done, without a word, McCrae took his mail and handed the poem to Allinson.  Allinson was deeply moved:  “The (Flanders Fields) poem was an exact description of the scene in front of us both. He used the word blow in that line because the poppies actually were being blown that morning by a gentle east wind. It never occurred to me at that time that it would ever be published. It seemed to me just an exact description of the scene.""  "
