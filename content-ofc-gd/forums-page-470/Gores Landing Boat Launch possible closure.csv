639145,Michael_Brown,2011-11-10 21:33:00,411,"Gores Landing Boat Launch possible closure  The Hamilton Township council is holding a meeting tonight in Gores Landing at the hall to discuss closing the Gores Landing boat launch and public dock.  If you are nearby tonight and can attend this meeting, please do so. The proposal to close the ramp is a real concern as they are also proposing closing the dock access. Lots of people use and enjoy this area of Rice Lake and if they close it everyone loses. The parking is a concern but they have options. According to the report they feel few people would be impacted by this decision and it would have limited impact on local tourism. It is up to anglers to let them know this area is important to us. They receive a few complaints on parking every year and this is what they are responding to. Time for the silent majority to be a loud squeaky wheel.  7 pm Gores Landing Hall. Just up the street from the ramp.  This same group is looking to collect fees for the Bewdley boat ramp, parking area and possibly the township park.  If you fish Rice Lake and enjoy good access to the lake and spend money in the region, you should have your opinion heard."

639154,Michael_Brown,2011-11-10 22:19:00,411,Not sure of their official position but if the access is blocked it will negatively affect tourism and employment by reducing tourism visits to the area by both resident and non-resident anglers and other lake users. Losing access to public angling areas is something we all should be concerned with.
639156,bigugli,2011-11-10 22:30:00,6138,Methinks a certain township might see an opportunity to collect $15-20 ramp fees like they do in a lot of spots on Simcoe.
639320,bigbuck,2011-11-11 15:02:00,2449,"The big problem there is that there is nowhere to park. There isn't a parking lot, just street parking in front of people's homes. I understand their concern but I also understand that anglers spend money in the area restaurants, gas stations, marinas, variety stores, bait shops and the like. Charge $10 to launch and retrieve, but provide a parking option. That's the root of the issue."
