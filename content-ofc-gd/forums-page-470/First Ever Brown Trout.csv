I first thought I had a snag, until it started to move.  He didn't fight very much, more of a sluggish pull.  However, I was pretty excited when I realized it was a brown. Overall, a pretty decent morning.  I also managed 3 small bows as well.  All fish were hiding under wood. Thanks for reading.           "
639057,l2p,2011-11-10 14:58:00,346,"Ive never really caught a brown in the rivers that fought like a steelie, come to think of it the only time ive ever seen a brown jump while hooked is at a certain marina when they used to come in heavy. Generally i think they just like to take runs and hug bottom. Nice fish btw"

639066,BFSC Kevin,2011-11-10 15:15:00,1351, Whatchu talkin' about? That brown I hooked into was jumping around and you thought it was something else.
639095,l2p,2011-11-10 16:13:00,346,hahah i stand corrected minus that one haha
639116,BillM,2011-11-10 17:40:00,17367,"Yeah, browns aren't really jumpers..  Total bulldogs..  Awesome fish!"
