638774,Canitalian,2011-11-09 17:09:00,75,Don't you hate the last cast of the day?
638776,johnnyb,2011-11-09 17:15:00,3413,Not if it catches me a fish!    But if that happens.... it's not the last cast
638778,Canitalian,2011-11-09 17:20:00,75,Good point. I'm the same way. If I do get something on the last cast then I'll cast a few more times just on case.
638779,mike rousseau,2011-11-09 17:22:00,4661,not on saturday...  i caught 100 walleye jigging then trolled up 5 more...  my arms hurt so bad the last cast was a relief...  but most days... yes... the last cast sucks
638783,EC1,2011-11-09 17:32:00,930,"Days where they're so bad that you can't wait til your buddy calls it? Had a few, but more often than not it'll be my last cast now, after about 5 more casts on top of that. Lol."
638788,Canitalian,2011-11-09 18:19:00,75,"For me it's like, time to go more that anything else"
638791,rocheleauc,2011-11-09 18:32:00,205,last cast/drift never ends up being the last one
638836,Canitalian,2011-11-09 21:23:00,75,"I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say that if it were up to us anglers,  we'd fish every second of the day, every day."
638838,Rod Caster,2011-11-09 21:36:00,5784,"Yup, last cast is always a hard one to call. It's usually pre-empted by several of these groans "" ..welllllllllllllll..."""
638840,Canitalian,2011-11-09 21:41:00,75,Good point Sinclair.
638842,misfish,2011-11-09 21:43:00,29133,"  This fall I have been wanting to keep drifting and drifting,but there comes a time when ya cant drift no more."
638845,Canitalian,2011-11-09 21:48:00,75,"Before you know it, ice fishing will be upon us. ??"
638854,misfish,2011-11-09 22:30:00,29133,  
638856,BillM,2011-11-09 22:36:00,17367," Then you get to walk out of the bush in the dark, lol.  That's always fun!"
638858,misfish,2011-11-09 22:40:00,29133," Ah I see we fish at diffrent times Bill. I walk in when it,s dark and leave when theres light.LOL"
638864,manitoubass2,2011-11-09 22:59:00,11391,"Oh my, sometimes my last cast happens consecutively for an hour or two. Last Cast can also mean, ""as soon as my spool runs empty, I'm done"""
638879,mercman,2011-11-09 23:38:00,7054,"The ""LAST"" cast....thats so sad  Almost like ""The Last Post"".I kinda expect to hear a soulful,lone bugle in the distance."
638880,Ron,2011-11-09 23:43:00,1683,"In the boat, I always call last cast. About a dozen or so casts later, i say out loud, ""Be the bigger man"" and put my rod away."
638886,Grimace,2011-11-10 00:20:00,2020,"I always say ""Well, I guess that's it eh Dad?"".  He says ""Yep, I guess it's that time"".   Then when he is putting his lure back in the box I continue to fish.  I snicker to myself everytime."
638887,misfish,2011-11-10 00:25:00,29133,  Yer cruel.
638912,Rizzo,2011-11-10 00:57:00,4754,thats ok. Make sure last cast is at the opposite end of the lake...gives you a long way to troll back
638917,Remastered,2011-11-10 01:01:00,143,I think I've made dozens of last casts on occasions. My father would eventually cut my line out of nowhere or somehow run away with my rod to end the day. I can't say I hated it though because it would always leave me laughing.
638982,Twocoda,2011-11-10 03:06:00,4130,"i object to the idea of a ""last cast"" as long as im still above sod....but sometimes there are long delays between them though"
639012,highdrifter,2011-11-10 07:09:00,2534,Ah yes...  The self proclaimed last cast..
639024,Skipper D,2011-11-10 11:00:00,1970,"... last cast for me is when i realize i can go home if i want to , genrealy caused by fatigue and hunger."
