I figure for sunday or monday I would love to fish Simcoe from sunrise to sunset, there is just one problem, I don't think there are any bait shops open at 6am and I worry that Emerald Shiners won't last 24 hours if I buy them they day before.  Those of you that are early birds, what do you usually do? Or is sleeping in the best option?  "
