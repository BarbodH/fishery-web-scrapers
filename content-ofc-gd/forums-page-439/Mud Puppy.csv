I thought it was going to be a good day......WRONG! A frew more perch was all for the day.  BassAssin (Matt) joined me around noon and after coffee and lunch we decided we would try some other areas. Having little concern for driving on the ice (minimum of 18"" all over now and more then 20"" in alot of areas) we tried the channel leading out to the main lake.  We fished around some of outfitter's huts in 21 feet of water and we were skunked. Marked very few fish for the 1st hour then a few came on to the screen. No takers. Back to my hut we went around 4:30. I left to pick up my boys and returned to finish the day with Matt. He had one more perch when I returned, and then pulled up a mud puppy.   My boys thought it was cool.   Day total was 4 perch and a mud puppy.   Here is a ""point and click"" picture I randomly took this afternoon. Thought it looks cool so I'm including it. "

667467,Nipfisher,2012-02-17 15:15:00,2449,  No stew but got me wondering.....can they be used for bait?
667470,Roy,2012-02-17 15:18:00,13728,I like the way they go into camo mode when caught and show spots that exactly match the spots on the ice. Ain't nature wonderful!
667482,Leecher,2012-02-17 16:02:00,7832,A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work... Did you stay for the night bite Blair?
667490,Rod Caster,2012-02-17 16:29:00,5784,  They are actually a protected species so they have to be released.
