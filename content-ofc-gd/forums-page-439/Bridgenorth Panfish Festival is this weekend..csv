666266,Ron,2012-02-14 02:29:00,1683,"The Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival is this Saturday on Chemong Lake from 10am - 2pm.   There will be refreshments, (hot chocolate), hot dogs and such. More importantly, this would be a great opportunity to get kids involved in ice fishing. Every kid will walk away with a great prize too. Last year some of the prizes were Shimano soft sided tackle boxes, Northland ice fishing rods, Shimano winter hats and tube jig starter kits to name a few.  Myself, along with several other people will be there, drilling holes, setting up Frabil ice huts to let people to fish out of. This will give kids and parents alike, a chance to see how nice of a set up you can have to enjoy the day out ice fishing. We will also have the new portable Aqua View mini camera along with Lowrance fishfinders. Some people say you can't run the HDS units as they eat batteries. i will be there to prove them wrong!  If you are interested in helping out with this great kids event contact Mike Brown, ( I hope he chimes in).  So.... is anyone from the board going to be there?  If you are, look for me at the Frabil huts, the one with the blue Artic Cat snowmobile.  I look forward to meeting a few new faces.  Cheers, Ron..."
666281,Michael_Brown,2012-02-14 03:16:00,411,"Hi Ron.  We can always count on our great volunteers to make this a fun family day fishing on Chemong Lake. Every year dozens of people, young and old catch their first ever fish at this family day and learn the joy of spending quality family time outdoors enjoying ice fishing together. Meet skilled anglers from the Kawartha chapter of Muskies Canada, Ontario Chinese Anglers Association and even the famous OFC member Ron.  We have been receiving lots of calls about the Bridgenorth Panfish Festival. Yes we are going ahead with everything planned. The ice conditions are very good with 15 inches of ice in the bay we fish. Weather is calling for -1 and sunny periods with tons of fish, family fun and smiles on Chemong Lake. This year as part of the Panfish Festival, activities will be going on inside at the OFAH Hertitage Center in Peterborough for more family fun. This is a great chance to see the cool facility and it's exhibits for free.  Maybe you will win a guided panfish trip for two with professional angler Chris Giles, or a night in an ice condo from BJ Tackle, a new ice hut from Frabill, rod/reel combos and clothing from Shimano, tackle boxes from Bridgenorth Sports, oil changes from Currie Tire, prizes from Lucky Strike, Canadian Tire, OFAH, Ontario Power Generation and many others who support this fun festival. Not many places you can spend a free day with the family and have a chance to win great prizes. Our sponsors are great supporters of youth angling and family fun. They support the angling community, we should support them.  Feb 18, 2012 10am - 2 pm Free for everyone, tackle, holes and bait provided Free prizes for youth and adults  Check the website for more details  http://www.bridgenorthpanfishfestival.com/"

666390,Live2fish85,2012-02-14 17:23:00,1633,I would love to bring the daughter and help you guys out with this but the girlfriend is ready to have a baby any day now. Today is the due date so I am sure I will have my hands full by this weekend.
666534,Michael_Brown,2012-02-15 00:17:00,411,Oh I wouldn't worry too much about who's coming Ron.  My phone has been ringing non-stop for the last week.  We are looking forward to a great day on the ice with lots of families and friends.
666920,Michael_Brown,2012-02-16 02:15:00,411,We filmed a segment for the 5 O'Clock show on Chex Tv for the Bridgenorth Panfish Festival which aired today. It was good to get out on the ice with some youth anglers again. Good warm up for the 1000 or so kids we are expecting on Saturday.  I'm not sure how to edit these clips down or if it's possible but here are the links for the show.   http://www.chextv.com/Watch/NW530/12-02-15/The_5_O_clock_Show_-_Wednesday_Feb_15_2012_Part_1_of_2.aspx  http://www.chextv.com/Watch/NW530/12-02-15/The_5_O_clock_Show_-_Wednesday_Feb_15_2012_Part_2_of_2.aspx
666935,Pigeontroller,2012-02-16 02:27:00,2793,Shouldn't it be called the Slush festival?
666951,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-16 02:44:00,627,Good interview Mike...when you get a bathroom in there she will be back.
666976,Michael_Brown,2012-02-16 03:46:00,411,"   Slush?  I was out yesterday and we have 16-18 inches of solid ice in the bay where we fish. No slush at all. The weather is looking good also, with a sunny high of 0 and 15kmh wind.  It should be a great day."
666983,Pigeontroller,2012-02-16 04:01:00,2793,Really? I guess its hard to imagine its actually winter when you live down here in the south...
667036,Jer,2012-02-16 13:50:00,1426,"  Best ice conditions in Ontario right here, I bet."
