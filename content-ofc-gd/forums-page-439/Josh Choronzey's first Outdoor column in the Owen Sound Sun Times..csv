667313,Ron,2012-02-17 01:16:00,1683,"It was a great read.  Nice to know people out there appreciate guys like Josh. This is a great way to get people aware of various projects that people could get involved in. I'll bet Josh has some great experiences fishing that he could write articles about.  Looking forward to reading other articles from the gentleman.   Cheers, Ron..."

667519,Grimace,2012-02-17 18:22:00,2020,Leave the old man out of it.  This is a good article by the son.  I happen to like the old man. Whether you do or do not like the old man has nothing to do with the work of the son.  He is his own person and should be judged on his own merits.
667522,Grimace,2012-02-17 18:26:00,2020,"If I lived in that area and was a reader of that paper, I would be thrilled that it added an outdoors piece.  I wish my local paper would do the same."
667523,davey buoy,2012-02-17 18:28:00,5505," Grimace,I was referring to the campfire comment,:oops:his sons work is good.I also like the old man."
667530,Grimace,2012-02-17 18:57:00,2020,"I realize that you were just responding.   I was just thinking that if the son would read this thread and saw it turn into a Darryl Choronzey thread instead of what it should be, well, it would be slightly depressing that's all.  Anyways, I thought it was a nice article giving credit to the people behind the scenes."
667532,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-17 18:59:00,1622," I Just sent an E-mail to Lucknow & Kincardine Papers it looks like their all owned by the same company, Maybe putting a bug in their Ear will get it republished in some of the Local weeklies, especially if the Articles are about the Area it can`t hurt, lets all send out some support & maybe get them thinking about it, this is the Companies list of papers check it out & send an E-mail Thanx & Tight Lines Spinnerbaitking"
