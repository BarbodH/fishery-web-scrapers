666519,Lunatic,2012-02-14 23:43:00,536,"I had a friend mention the KVD 1.5 silent crankbait to me the other day. he loves it and is talking like its the best thing hes used for crankbaits. im not a huge fan of crankbaits nor do i ever have much luck with them,but i jumped on bass pros website and read a few reviews (all of them good) and on youtube to watch more good reviews. anyone here use these? are they really this good?"
666523,Dan668,2012-02-14 23:52:00,1120,I like them. Use the 1.5 alot
666529,ecmilley,2012-02-15 00:01:00,2163,"yes there that good, have a bunch"
666559,Cudz,2012-02-15 01:28:00,2652,yes. 1.5 - hands down best crank i have ever used
666590,Lunatic,2012-02-15 02:56:00,536,"Hmm, looks like I'm gonna have to buy a couple when bass pro had their spring classic sale"
666612,ctranter,2012-02-15 04:12:00,543,"Shhhh mod please lock this thread.  1.5 KvD topwaters have been my secret for smallies in shallow lakes for years.  (p.s. I am kidding about locking, obviously)  good luck"
666670,OhioFisherman,2012-02-15 14:00:00,6623,"I haven`t used that particular one, but I wouldn`t go fishing with out carrying some crankbaits. Like any lure they can be hot or not on any given day, but you can`t determine that unless you use them.  It is self defeating to limit yourself to limited choices of lures, you don`t have to buy them all, just see what works for others and use them."
666723,Lunatic,2012-02-15 16:59:00,536,"I still throw cranks from time to time and always have them on hand but over the past 2 years they have been shuffled back in the arsenal in favour of better producing baits,same goes for buzzbaits, love using them but don't get much on them."
666825,OhioFisherman,2012-02-15 22:23:00,6623,"Lunatic, far and away most of my fish came on soft plastics, but I was always prepared and willing to throw other baits. I have caught 10 bass in 10 casts on a crankbait, won a tournament throwing one over a weed flat for two days, but it is not always the way to go. Also had real good days with a buzzbait, but other lures have worked better in the same spots at times."
666841,superdad,2012-02-15 22:53:00,353,"Saw a segment of ""Getting Schooled"" and KVd was hawking his rod and reel combo and stated that he could cast a lure 70 yards with his outfit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Must have a heck of an arm......  David  aka  Superdad"
666848,Djeep,2012-02-15 23:42:00,199,definitely worth looking into. ive seen quite a few different species go after these kvd's rattles and silent
666900,boombap,2012-02-16 01:44:00,310,"Bass pro sells a kit that comes with 12 KVD cranks, I picked it up.  http://www.basspro.com/Strike-King-Kevin-VanDam-12Piece-KVD-Square-Bill-Crankbaits-Kit/product/10211767/95043"
667042,OhioFisherman,2012-02-16 14:03:00,6623," My yard is 200 feet wide, roughly 65 yards? I for one would believe him."
667049,mike rousseau,2012-02-16 14:16:00,4661, I guess it depends on the lure...  I'm pretty sure he can't cast a small floating rapala that far...  I can cast over 100 yds with my carp rod...
667187,Lunatic,2012-02-16 20:56:00,536,I'm going to try to use them more this year and try to build confidence in them.
