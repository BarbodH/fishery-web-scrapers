Was only a matter of time with my penchant for falling over   Stepped into a snow filled hole and went for a spin. Heard my knee go pop real good. Didn't feel a thing, and figgered myself lucky, but the leg was not doing what I wanted. Got home and a few hours later I finally start to feel the knee seizing up  . Appears I'm supposed to be on crutches for a few weeks. We'll see about that. I have plans on being at Fishing for Tyler and doing more than spectating."
