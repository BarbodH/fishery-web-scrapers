667133,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-16 18:37:00,336,I just got a new Cabelas Platinum ZX rod this week.  The claim is a new 3M Powerlux composite graphite that is 15% lighter and 30% stronger.  Slappin on a Platinum ZX tournament spinning reel.  Also trying out Berkley's TransOptic 8# mono.  http://www.cabelas.c...%3Bcat104836680
667197,Jer,2012-02-16 21:31:00,1426,"Last June at Lakair, I was lucky enough to win beautiful Spiel custom light 6'6"" spinning rod in a raffle. I didn't have a decent reel for it all of last summer and didn't use it as much as I would have liked.  For Christmas I got a new Stradic 1000FI reel for it (only seen ice duty so far) so I'm looking forward to getting more use from the rod, sure to become one of my favourites. Looks to be a dandy panfish, light jigging and small crankbait rod."

667206,jedimaster,2012-02-16 21:44:00,3472,Can I have 3 favorites?  St.Croix Legend Tournament in 5'10 with my stradic for skipping docks. I love this setup and can skim one under a 30 foot dock front front to back bounce off the shoreline and land it in a pina colada laying down next to the a girl laying down for a tan  Cumara 6'8 M XF and curado E7 for finesse jiggs so light and comfy I can flip all day with this setup.  GL2 drop shot rod with a stradic. I love this setup as well.
667216,PainInTheBass,2012-02-16 22:06:00,102,Daiwa S O L baitcaster and a custom ultralight baitcasting rod for soft plastics.  I caught my PB bass on that as well as a musky.  Too much fun.

It seems like a great rod and cant wait to get it wet. I will be pairing it with my bps pro qualifier reel for now. It's the 6:4:1 gear ratio, what do you guys think?"

667508,Garry2Rs,2012-02-17 17:29:00,1425,"For the last ten years my go-to Senko rod has been a St.Croix Avid 6'9"" ml with a Stradic 1000.  I've used it so much that I had to re wrap the guides this winter!  I have a 7ft. Walleye series G.Loomis Crankbait rod with a Chronarch and an 6.5 and 7ft Loomis IMX's with Chronarch's as well.  These rods are great when I want a little more feel as with spinnerbaits and Carolina rigs etc.  This winter I built a new Crappie rod on a Spin-Jig blank that is now the love of my life...grin.  Using another Stradic 1000, it is light enough to throw 1/32 jigs, but the butt is strong enough to handle large fish...I have landed some 2 and 4 pound Bass with it no problem. Garry2rs"
666897,bucktail,2012-02-16 01:41:00,1857,The fishing show is this weekend and if your anything like me youll be suffering from cabin fever and looking for an  upgrade to your equipement to hopefully make you a little more effective this year.  Saying all of that what is your favorite rod and reel combo and why? This might help out someone else that is looking for a set up for certain conditions.  My personal fav is a Loomis crankbait casting rod with a Shimano Curado and 15 pound floro. Help a brother out!!!      Darren
666904,mercman,2012-02-16 01:50:00,7054,"Right now its a 6.5ft Quantum PT with a Citica E. 20lb power pro. Extremely sensitive rod, bulletproof reel. Working on my new favorite, when i find the right rod for my Curado 300.Any Suggestions?"

666915,bucktail,2012-02-16 02:13:00,1857,Merc.... I have my 300 on a Shimano Crucial medium heavy 7 footer. I use it as a flipper and a frogger for real heavy stuff. Works nice. I also put it on a Fenwick telescoping heavy fliupping stick for burning smaller buctails muskie and pike fishing.    Darren

666921,workwear,2012-02-16 02:16:00,592,i have to agree with wiser...the sustain's are very nice spinning reels...the smoothest ive ever had...
666923,mercman,2012-02-16 02:17:00,7054, Hummmm. The Fishing/hunting show is 23-26 here in Montreal.Maybe i should check that out I just love new tackle  Thanks Darren.
666930,Dan668,2012-02-16 02:22:00,1120," I have the that NRX also, have a Daiwa S O L 2500 but looking to upgrade. How do you like the new sustain?"
666936,Bondar,2012-02-16 02:28:00,817,I really like the sustain I've been using it from the boat on the lower Niagara for trout and the drag hasn't failed me yet ! So if handles the big jumps and runs of 10lb chromers I have no doubt it will handle any Bass on erie this summer . Minus the dumb kickstand lol
666941,ckrb2007,2012-02-16 02:34:00,449,"Love my Abu Verdict / Revo STX combo with 50lb Sufix 832, and my St. Croix eyecon snap jig / pflueger supreme xt combo."
666942,boombap,2012-02-16 02:34:00,310,"bucktail,  How do you like that rod? Im looking to pick up a new crankbait rod soon, I want to spend $150 tops.  I was looking at the st. croix premier series crank rods but havent been able to find one to look at up close. I also took a look at the BPS crankin sticks and they seem pretty nice considering the price.  Anyone have a opinion on a budget crankin rod?"

666960,MCTFisher9120,2012-02-16 03:03:00,3761,I have a Loomis NRX 7'1H that I love for pitching jigs in light cover...It's very powerful and the most sensitive rod I've fished. I paired it with a Core 50MG7 and the lightweight concept of the combo backed by a strong reel and 50lb braid. I suggest this setup for any body that loves to pitch jigs 1/2oz and under and plastics as well.  My favorite combo
666961,MCTFisher9120,2012-02-16 03:06:00,3761," Shimano Compre or Crucial Crankbait Rod. (99.99-159.99) and a Shimano Chronarch(204.99). The weight difference is noticeable in between these two series and any same rods compared. It's not much but enough maybe.  Decide between the rods but for a reel that you plan on casting with all day long I don't think the Curado would be good enough but I'm sure it will do the job. For $50 more you can have a very smooth light good reel that is well worth the price.  Hope this helps,  MTBF"

667009,wormdunker,2012-02-16 11:57:00,1711,"Loomis IMX 7' with Shimano Spirex 1000, 8lb Trilene XL for walleye.  Been using this unit for the smaller walleye for 10 years.  Love it.  I also use an older Browning 6' Cardinal 3 spooled with 8lb XL.  This unit is 20 years old.  I can't give it up - it has caught me more fish than I can remember.  For the ""hog"" walleye on Erie I use a 7' Shimano Clarus with Ambassadeur 6500 spooled with 30 power pro, & 5' flouro leader.  I really like the Clarus rod, so I purchased a spinning version as well, mounted a Penn 4500 on this baby!  I love them all - now which one do I use???"
667028,bucktail,2012-02-16 13:27:00,1857,Boombap.  I love my combo its slower action allows me to NOT pull the bait away from fish. For a cheaper rod you might want to check out the KVD crankbait rods. If he can win everything under the sun throwing a crankbait with that rod who am Ito second guess him!!LOL
667058,Ralph Field,2012-02-16 14:29:00,1018,Too hard to pick one. It really depends on the type of fish that I'm after and the method that I've chosen to use. I love my 6.5 Fenwick(hook setter series) paired with a Diawa SS1300 when fishing live crayfish. This combo certainly wouldn't be my favourite if I was after steelhead.
667062,ecmilley,2012-02-16 14:49:00,2163,favorite? hard to pick but if iam pitching st.croix legend with a core mfgv pitchen reel or tube dragging wacky rig for smallies is a st croix avid ipc med action with a core 50 both super light which makes a difference all day in the boat
667094,steel&chrome,2012-02-16 17:02:00,46,being that everyone's throwing shimano's in the mix i decided to give some love to diawa and would definitely go with the Diawa Zillion! with a 7 footer Medium St.croix legend tournament !  I'm itching just by the sound of that combo!
667103,backbay,2012-02-16 17:23:00,773,"My favourite combo isn't my best! It's a 6'2"" Gary Roach paired with a Pflueger Supreme. I've fished the combo for years; it's been used for all kinds of different rigs and lures, and has been a reliable workhorse of a rig that I don't have to baby. I just like the feel and familiarity of it, more than anything. The reel is excellent in its own right...."
