667013,ironstone74,2012-02-16 12:25:00,201,Has anyone done any inshore fishing around Panama City or Destin in Florida?  I have read there are Tarpon around as well as some Bass Lakes nearby.  I'm not sure what type of gear to bring for the piers?  Thanks for any help.  Paul
667018,Hud,2012-02-16 12:47:00,140,went out of Destin a hand full of years back.  We used Angry fish charters.  Interesting capt.  Had a decent day.  Fishing was a little slow but seemed to be the few days before and after as well.

We went for Sea Trout and it was a balst-non stop action, few fish over 5 lbs and best of all we kept a few, Cptn fillets them, drops them off at the little tiki bar at the marina and we were having fresh fish 3 wasy, with amazing homemade slaw and potato salad with ice cold beers. http://captrichknox.com/"
667344,craigdritchie,2012-02-17 02:13:00,1586,"Forget bass - Florida is for saltwater fishing. It's great, the fish fight way harder than anything in freshwater, and it's not something you get to do every day so take full advantage. Bass? Pffft - can catch them at home.  Shore fishing can be great, but you have to time it right. The best fishing is when the tide is actually running. It doesn't matter if it's going in or out, it just has to be moving. That gives you four periods each day, each lasting about two hours, when fishing will be really good. Buy a tide chart and figure it out. Fishing when the tide is not moving (i.e. high tide or low tide) generally sucks. You need the current to get things happening.  When the tide is running, lots of fish come to the shorelines and docks to feed. You can hook anything that lives in the Atlantic ocean - small stuff like pinfish and blue runners, to big fish like snook, redfish, tarpon and sharks.  I'm in Florida right now, attending the Miami boat show. Here's a crappy camera phone picture of some tarpon that were hanging around the docks this afternoon. These are babies .... only about three feet long, and 15 - 20 pounds. Last night, there were much bigger ones rolling around as it got dark.    We were feeding these guys French fries. Toss the fry in the water, watch it sink a bit, and here comes this big open mouth to gobble it down. It was awesome!  Saltwater fishing is a riot. Use whatever tackle you have, but heavier is better (remember to rinse it in the shower after each day's fishing). Just buy some live shrimp (sold everywhere) and enjoy. It couldn't be easier - or more fun."
667358,Stef,2012-02-17 02:41:00,63,"I have fished a lot on the beaches in the area and in Choctawhatchee Bay on the rocks off of the Hwy 331 causeway.  Used to stay at the bungalows at Topsail until they put the prices through the roof, usually for the month of April give or take a week or so either side.  Off the beach catch Pompano, Whiting, Redfish, Flounder (all good eating) and Cravelle Jacks, Lady Fish, etc. (not good eating).  Also some Mackeral, Cobia and others available.  Easiest way is to use a long rod, sand spike rod holder and a ""Pompano rig"" with sandfleas as bait.  Pompano rig is three hooks snelled to a main line, add a 4-5 oz pyramid sinker which digs into the sand on bottom and keep a tight line over the tops of the waves coming in (hence the long rod).  Some use a float rig made up of a balloon, heavy weight and a shrimp for bait, let the wind and waves carry the bait out further than a cast.  Most days I would walk the beach with an 8'6"" steelhead rod and 4000 size Sedona with 40lb braid and a 1-2 oz feather jig and sight fish to schools or on openings in the sandbar.  Same things on the Bay but not as nice scenery and difficult to walk the rocks, pull the car over to the side and get out a lawn chair or cast.  Some tips:  Get a book to help identify saltwater fish.  There is a Bass Pro in Destin and the Walmarts in the area usually have knowledgable retired guys working sporting goods.  Walk the beach once and talk to the guys fishing, they will almost always be happy to explain techniques, help identify fish, etc.  Saltwater kills tackle, rinse in fresh water after use and don't use expensive stuff.  Non-residents need a licence to fish off the beach in Florida, not so on the piers.  There are sharks along that stretch, lots of them, shallower than you'll ever imagine and you don't swim before 9 or after 5.  Swimmers (note the plural) are hit every year and its not discussed much because its bad for tourism, its a migration route and the deep water is very close to shore.  Don't fight fish standing in water deeper than your knees and back out as you get them closer to you.  Wear Polaroids and if you get a chance take a walk along the shore as the sun goes down, you'll see them...  If you want to throw a jig, its usually the longest cast you can make plus about 10-15' further that you will see the schools (wade a bit, heavier jig and just frustrating to see your lure hit the water short).  Look for light grey areas in the clear water moving along the bottom, again Polaroids and hat to shade eyes.  You'll also see easily spotted black fish shapes moving quickly if you can get a cast in front of them and Cobias look like small 4-6' sharks.  Ladyfish are a blast to catch but full of bones.  Salt water fish are hard fighters and if you get into them you will eventually be to tired to cast anymore, but what a way to go.  If you get bit off have a steel leader and re-tie with that, some of these guys have teeth and there're usually big.  You'll have a ball..........."
