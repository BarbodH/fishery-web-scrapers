Unfortunately, the diving goldeneyes stayed out from shore. Spent some time working on catching birds in flight. Not the easy task to do, but am going to try to perfect it over the next couple of months.  Here are a few images from my shoot. The full set, and some descriptions and details, can be found on my site:  http://justinhoffmanoutdoors.com/2012/02/15/a-day-spent-with-ducks/             Enjoy!  Cheers,  Justin"
