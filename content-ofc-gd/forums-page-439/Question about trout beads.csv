666774,misfish,2012-02-15 19:50:00,29133,"I now have some of those trout beads(going to give them a try this weekend) and was told to use a tooth pick to hold it in place on the line.I think the wood, would be abrasive to the line. My question is,is there another way? I hear theres a soft rubber peg you can get.  Looking forward to trying them out,as I have heard nothing but good things.  Thanks"
666779,kickingfrog,2012-02-15 20:02:00,8333,I've never had a problem with wood toothpicks. It's the rocks that concern me. Plus the wood is more Eco friendly.
666784,wallacio,2012-02-15 20:10:00,475,"I like the soft bead pegs myself...you can get them at Hook, Line & Sinker in Guelph.   Scroll down in this link to see a few pictures of the pegs.  http://www.hooklineandsinker.ca/hls/index.html  They can also be held in place by a knot...see link:  http://www.troutbeads.com/How_To.html"
666794,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-15 20:48:00,826,Thick piece of mono cut on a 45 and trimmed appropriately. We still have to get out. R
666798,Twocoda,2012-02-15 21:13:00,4130,kiss the wife goodbye and get up here....you have won a guide for the day....
666820,Sharkbait22,2012-02-15 22:03:00,297,"The toothpick is not a great idea b/c it defeats the fast sink rate of the egg. Not a big deal if your sink rate doesn't matter, but in a lot of places it does. Consider the end of a riffle before it drops into a pool. Sometime you need to get done into that transition water fast. Fish can sit in this water picking up drifting eggs from fish spawning on said riffle.  The rubber pegs are fine. You can easily tie them on too. Peg from the bottom up. my 2c"
666821,Garnet,2012-02-15 22:04:00,2056,Trout beads just another way to use Bobber Stops.
666870,Ralph Field,2012-02-16 00:48:00,1018,"A bobber stop works fine as already mentioned, a nail knot can be used in place of the bobber stop, grass trimmer line cut on an angle can be used in place of the heavy mono cut on an angle. I have the peg its that floatman sells,but I haven't tried them yet. A girl in the US is selling bead pegs that anglers say work better than the  peg-its. She charges $5.50 for 50 mailed to Canada. Her contact is( [emailÂ protected]). I have been pulling elastics through the bead with a scrap piece of mono and then trimming the elastic."
666872,Dozer,2012-02-16 00:56:00,896,"I knot the bead, same reasoning as sharkbait.  The beads I use are bouyant enough that I cant add wood."
666875,BillM,2012-02-16 01:00:00,17367,No issues using toothpicks.  Although I do have some killer soft rubber pegs that I haven't had the chance to test out yet.
666940,SirCranksalot,2012-02-16 02:33:00,3291,I have beads that float. I've tried them briefly w/o luck. I understand that most beads sink. I couldn't see how the little piece of toothpick left in the bead making much diff with the buoyancy.(don't need to leave the whole toothpick on the line)
666955,ironstone74,2012-02-16 02:54:00,201,I use peg-its.  They hold the bead in place and still can be slid up and down your leader.  Gives you the option to run just a single bead or you can slide the bead up and run a roe bag or yarnie on the bottom.  Beads were the only thing that worked for me today  Paul
667010,Garnet,2012-02-16 12:06:00,2056,The beads that float are plastic. They also have larger holes that a small bobber stop will slid into. Your hook will sink them in frog water.
667092,misfish,2012-02-16 16:55:00,29133,"Thanks guys for your input. Gave them a try this morning with no action,but old faithful roe bags worked.   I,m sure in the right conditions, they will work for me."
667123,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 17:55:00,10439, You want a faster sink rate just ditch the plastic beads and run glass or clay beads.
667126,misfish,2012-02-16 18:14:00,29133, Do you have an online/site contact Dave?  Thanks
667147,kickingfrog,2012-02-16 19:04:00,8333,Try a crafts store.
667149,BillM,2012-02-16 19:06:00,17367,"Brian, Michael's has all you'd ever need."
667151,misfish,2012-02-16 19:13:00,29133," Ya,Im heading there after my fish Friday.  As for the peg,I got a great pm tip.My wife wasnt happy,but I promised to buy her a new one. LOL"
667153,BillM,2012-02-16 19:15:00,17367,"The dollar store has all the pegs you need, just be creative"
667162,misfish,2012-02-16 19:29:00,29133," Oh that pm was,CREATIVE."
667169,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 20:08:00,10439, Here is a clay site.  http://www.sculpey.com/  FYI mixing and swirling=good beads. You can hand roll your clay beads or get a Bead Roller Just don't forget to make the hole in the bead before baking the clay. LOL  Glass beads can be had at craft stores like Michaels.
667209,Twocoda,2012-02-16 21:48:00,4130, the problen i found with craftstore beads is ....the hole edges are sometimes sharp...therefore it doesnt take much of a tug on your line to break you off once underload....but the ones walmart sells in their craft section seem to be ok ....while your there...pick up some of the round yarn balls...all ya have to do is put a hook through them and your good to go ....but ...they have a tendancy to slid off or up the hook ....experiment and youll figure it out...
667229,misfish,2012-02-16 22:36:00,29133,  Did that 20 years ago. Where ya been? LOL
