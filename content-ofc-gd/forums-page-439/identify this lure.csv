666895,hhpeter,2012-02-16 01:37:00,6,"I have this lure which is almost the same as a bad boy, somebody gave it to me sometime ago, I don't remember who ....if anybody knows the name or where I can find one please let me know "
666898,bucktail,2012-02-16 01:43:00,1857,"Its a Meegs ice jig isnt it, killer whitefish lure>"
666902,NAW,2012-02-16 01:48:00,4022,"That's what I was thinking, but there are some many knock off's these days.  The only real Meegs I've seen are warn out, with no paint left on them."
666906,Muskieman,2012-02-16 01:52:00,2472,Meegs for sure ... Matzuo make a close replica ... It's also pretty good available at CTC and Wally*World...  Randy 
666908,pike slayer,2012-02-16 01:55:00,1177,badd boyzzzz
666912,hhpeter,2012-02-16 02:07:00,6,"It seems more guys agree on meegs, where can I buy some of this Meegs or at least a knock off that looks the same ? I checked Canadian Tire, Bass Pro, le Baron, Trombolys in Orillia  nobody has them...."
666925,mukluk,2012-02-16 02:19:00,196,"Sure looks like a ""hump back creeper"" ;   a cousin to the Meegs bad boy."
666945,NANUK,2012-02-16 02:35:00,797,"Out of all lure of that kind/shape, I find Shoal Digger to be of the best quality, very durable paint, glass eyes and good quality hooks......and they catch fish !!"
666949,hhpeter,2012-02-16 02:41:00,6, I think you're right it looks like a hump back creeper do you know a store when I can get a few of this beauty's?
666959,ckrb2007,2012-02-16 03:03:00,449,I'd say humpback creeper. Meegs have a bigger head in relation to the body. BTW.......the new Meegs are awesome. New colour schemes. Thanks James.
666964,Grimace,2012-02-16 03:27:00,2020,  Correct.  Meegs have bumps on the top of them.
666972,GBW,2012-02-16 03:43:00,8460,even blue fox has a lure like it
666984,Sinker,2012-02-16 04:01:00,8692,"Thats definitely a humpback creeper. Caseys in port bolster has a few of them, as well as tight lines in pickering.  I prefer the shoal diggers too. Meegs work good, but the paint doesn't stay on, and the hooks fall out. They have THE BEST action though.  Humpbacks are good too, but they lay over on thier side when they hit bottom.  The shoal diggers have great paint, awesome hooks, and they last forever .  Matzuo work just fine too, until the paint comes off. Thier hooks are a little flimsy, and need sharpening all the time.

666997,davey buoy,2012-02-16 09:35:00,5505,The fish ontario on the 400 has these or a knock off of some sort.He sure goes through a lot of them.That's the service center in maple on the 4oo north side.
666998,wormdunker,2012-02-16 10:23:00,1711,"Hwy 400 runs north/south, so Fish Ontario would be on the east side (right side).  Do U get lost very often in WalMart?  Sorry couldn't resist LOL"
667007,hhpeter,2012-02-16 11:46:00,6,"Thanks a lot guys , this is a great forum...."
667085,Lunkerhunter,2012-02-16 16:26:00,455,wormdunker....pretty sure he meant on the 400 northbound side. not necessarily the north side of the highway. lol  if not than yes i agree with you he must get lost often.  i would also say its a humpback creeper. caseys in port bolster is where i get mine. also for whitefish when tipped with a small tube on the back end.
667086,Rob,2012-02-16 16:33:00,467,Nasty Nick. You can get them at Trombly's on Orillia.
667152,davey buoy,2012-02-16 19:14:00,5505,"400 north,east side lol."
