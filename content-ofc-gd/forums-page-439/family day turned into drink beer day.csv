It turned into your typical LONG WEEKEND GONG SHOW complete with beer, high speed sleds and testosterone levels that are off the charts. Geez another long weekend to avoid at the camp! I really hoped to see kids ice fishing, sliding, snowshoeing, etc. Too many people buy into the Coors lifestyle ads. Thanks rant over and i feel much better. Dan O."

667751,Frank,2012-02-18 21:46:00,74,"If I didn't have to work this weekend,  I would be taking advantage of driving north for some ice fishing with the guys and throwing back a few brews, that said, on Monday when my wife gets off work, we will be taking advantage of some of the Family DAY activities going on in our city. You could have the best of both worlds, but unfortunately work gets in the way. ...Remember it's Family DAY (Monday) not Family weekend."
667811,Oggie,2012-02-19 02:48:00,588,Good point and to their defense these guys don't have any kids. Good thing as they're drag racing with no helmets on.
667822,ecmilley,2012-02-19 04:08:00,2163,stay in then and make it family planning day
667823,danc,2012-02-19 04:12:00,4677,No different that any other Canadian long weekend IMHO. Us fishermen use it to go fishing. The party guys use it to party. Do you really honour the Queen mothers birthday in May??    Yup. Didn't think so.
