667521,misfish,2012-02-17 18:24:00,29133,"Got out again today. It was very slow. Hit many spots. Walked and walked. I finaly tried the Raven rod and sst2 I bought last spring. I was pleased with both,but my problem is,they dont balance. I,m going to try wrapping some copper wire at the butt and see how that works. I found it to be a bit tip heavy.  2 fish for my efforts. The first I got to shore,but the ice edge sliced the line.   The second was more manageable.LOL    Back at it again in the AM."
667525,BillM,2012-02-17 18:31:00,17367,"The Raven IM6 I had as my first rod was a wet noodle, I didn't have it very long."
667528,misfish,2012-02-17 18:43:00,29133," It,s not that bad Bill. Like I said,just a bit tip heavy. Other then that,I really like the combo. And the bigger reel is sweet to reel."
667529,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-17 18:52:00,826,"Nice one Brian, Love my SST, mine is not pretty ( years of roe crust lol) but it keeps spinning.  I reach for that pin more often than the others I have."
667537,misfish,2012-02-17 19:41:00,29133,"  Thanks. Ya that SST is a sweet reel. I spooled up my new Okuma raw for the rest of the weekend. Man that,s one sensitive reel. I put it on my Quantum pro. JohnF, is always watching over me when I use that rod."
667561,BillM,2012-02-17 21:05:00,17367, You wait until you hook into a 10lb hot chromer..  It will be up for sale after it breaks you off in the wood!    :)
667563,misfish,2012-02-17 21:10:00,29133," Ok,we will see.Im thinking not. If it does,it will be cause I was a wuss,and didnt set the balls to it."
667596,Twocoda,2012-02-17 22:41:00,4130, sentimental moment....i miss John...but hopefully his fishing desires are filled vicariously through you .....he used to get skunked ALOT
667703,Djeep,2012-02-18 13:16:00,199,"I have discovered the lack of power in my raven im6.. whats a good alternative without breaking the bank? I'm still new to this game but maybe if you slide the reel up a bit itl balance better.. that being said, i find it hard to tell when my setup is 'balanced'"
667853,BillM,2012-02-19 14:47:00,17367, Streamside for sure.
667101,misfish,2012-02-16 17:20:00,29133,"Was not sure what to expect this morning as far as river conditions. The weather has been crazy. Would it be high and dirty and fast? Just so you know,it wouldnt matter,as I was     . I arrived just as daylight was approaching.Snow mixed with some freezing rain greeted me. Get suited up and start the long walk. Note to self. When temps are close to zero and your walking a good klick or two,wear light wadders not neoprenes.  I didnt see a soul the whole way in, and that was just fine with me.Not even an old foot track. SWEET. Get to my spot and the water is a little high,but fishable, and it was my fav colour. I started the first 1/2 hour drifting the new beads that I had. I was hoping they were going to produce,but I think the water was a little to fast for them. Not sure.  So it was time to go to roe. BINGO. Fish on. Not big but still fun none the less. Quick pic and released. Dozen more drifts and fish on. Another small silver. I seem to only get small silvers for some reason.LOL  Once again,quick pic and released. My fav mesh colour is chartruce,but I tied a few bags with red mesh. So hook one on,make a drift and smash. It,s a good fish. Saddly,it was a short lived fight.   Still not use to big fish on the pin. I seem to forget the rod will do the work,but Im afraid Im going to break it.  After a few more drifts,I get a hookset and spit. LOL I didnt have alot of time to fish today so I started my walk back. On my way,I see a promising hole and give it a try for 15 minutes. I was rewarded with another small silver. So for 3.5 hours,I went 3 for 5. Not bad in my books,and got out. I,ll be back at it friday morning. I have the whole day.  Here are some pics of the three I was able to land. CLONES. LOL      This one could of choked to death on that sac.LOL    Thanks for reading."
667104,Twocoda,2012-02-16 17:23:00,4130,Nice shooting Bryan....the fish looks fresh
667110,Djeep,2012-02-16 17:34:00,199,"You had better luck than I today, thanks for sharing."
667111,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-16 17:35:00,65,"Wonderful post Byan, I loved the read.  So cool how you can have the morning and then be back with fish+pictures up by noon. =D"
667113,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-16 17:39:00,2690,"Nicely done!!  Some beautiful chromers as a reward for a long trek in miserable conditions  I'm still hoping for one last ice outing, but, I'm pretty close to closing the books on the short hardwater season."
667115,I'mHooked,2012-02-16 17:40:00,525,"Nice job Brian, good looking fish."
667136,Joey,2012-02-16 18:38:00,9122,That's awesome B.  It sure is looking to be better than my day here at work I'll tell ya that

667154,davey buoy,2012-02-16 19:19:00,5505,"Your sure having a great winter Brian,need to catch a couple myself:good:"
667156,mercman,2012-02-16 19:22:00,7054,That is a wonderful specimen Brian.I am so happy you let us see it.Please be careful out there.  
667157,misfish,2012-02-16 19:23:00,29133," Thanks buddy. They sure were spunky. Talk to you soon about that trip out your way.   You got out.That,s the main thing.   Ya, it,s nice to have many spots just minutes away. If it,s blown,I can go else where quick.   Thanks Frankie   Thanks,was nice to get out.   Hey J. If I didnt book a few days off,I would of blown up. I need to take time for me,and this is just what the doctor ordered.   Thanks my friend. You should come for a walk someday. Never know,ya just might like it.   Ya,like you didnt know Bill. LMAO If your free the next 4 days,give a shout bud."
667160,misfish,2012-02-16 19:28:00,29133," It,s like riding a bike Paul. TY   Hey Dave,dont you have something for me? Good reason for a hook up, dont ya think. Get back to me."
667170,Spiel,2012-02-16 20:15:00,9065,Nice!
667175,Roy,2012-02-16 20:22:00,13728,"That's fantastic Brian me brudder! Great day, great fish and great pics! Cook a nice one up for Miss Betty and you're a happenin' dude!"
667177,Twocoda,2012-02-16 20:27:00,4130, I think Paul was just making sure you keep the seat on that bike....
667180,misfish,2012-02-16 20:33:00,29133, Thanks Chris.   Thanks me brudder. Tonight were going for asian.As soon as she gets home from work.
667190,Terry,2012-02-16 21:05:00,14456," I would have to borrow equipment from you, but hey when it warms up a bit more I might just take you up on the offer"
667191,icefisherman,2012-02-16 21:16:00,952,"Nice report and lovely pictures brian. I've been thinking about going out myself but also can't decide on what the water condition will be...may just have to go and try it...can't believe the huge size of roe bag that one fish has gone after  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
667232,misfish,2012-02-16 22:38:00,29133," I have what you need,just say when.   LOL  And to think,I got to use it after that.BONUS"
667236,Rod Caster,2012-02-16 22:51:00,5784,"Fresh fish indeed! nice having the option of river or ice, isn't it?"
667255,misfish,2012-02-16 23:24:00,29133," Back when I was heavy into river fishing,I always chose to fish the river when/where possible. I like ice fishing,but it seems my old roots have returned.If the river permits,then that,s where I,m headed."
667269,spincast,2012-02-16 23:57:00,3279,jealous - some nice chrome there - day off work and fish
667328,MJL,2012-02-17 01:45:00,2427,"Nicely done Brian  Ironically, I've become the opposite. Since I got into ice fishing, once the lake freezes over, I find myself reaching for the auger and 36"" rods VS the 13'6"". It's been about a month since I last took a drift though...Maybe this weekend I'll be in your neck of the woods"
667480,Leecher,2012-02-17 15:53:00,7832,Nice chrome Brian    Good job bud Got to love it when you can have a spot all to yourself
