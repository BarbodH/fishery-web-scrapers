It was a beautiful day out on big Lake Winnipeg and after a tough mid week outing we put some nice fish on the ice. It wasn't a big numbers day today, but multiple 30""ers and a few fish in the 26-28"" range were iced.  On the ice early and lots of drilling to find the edges of very subtle breaks in the featureless south basin were the key to finding these fish. Fish showed a definite preference to yellow coloured baits today, a mix of Lindy Darters, Live Targets and scented plastics were the undoing of these brutes.  On the ice early    My big fish for the day     Local guide Lee Nolden, has a new on-ice ride, this thing just floats over the snow.    Can't wait until tomorrow and Louis Riel Day on Monday!!"
667784,bucktail,2012-02-19 01:29:00,1857,Nice eye and funkier ride!!!
667787,Gregoire,2012-02-19 01:33:00,1397,Here in Ontario we call Monday family day but I would way rather celebrate Louis Riel day
667808,Leecher,2012-02-19 02:28:00,7832,Redemption you say... White strips was what we had today after hitting a couple of lakes   WOW that big fish sure is purdy    Congrats Jay
667819,Bassnbows,2012-02-19 03:49:00,58,Nice going. Did'nt know Walleye hit Darters(lol) I've tried and tried and nothing. Hate them.
667821,Live2fish85,2012-02-19 03:53:00,1633,Nice work thats a nice walleye. That a sweet ice machine.
667835,Billy Bob,2012-02-19 13:03:00,5865,"Jay, very nice fish.......and that truck with those tracks is something else....you don't see that everyday.  BTW...how far are you from Aikens Lake....got a nice offer through Cabela's to fish at Aikens Lake Lodge....but still a bit too pricey when you figure in the airfare to Winnipeg. Have you ever fished Aikens Lake ?"
667848,Rod Caster,2012-02-19 14:32:00,5784,What a green slob that walleye is!  Those matt tracks are awesome. We used them in the high arctic and they completly conquered the terrain.
667858,troutologist,2012-02-19 15:09:00,951," Hey Billy Bob, have never been to Aikens but have talked to a couple guys that have guided there...apparently its a first rate operation with some very good fishing. Some other buddies flew in moose hunting in the same watershed and had some amazing fall fishing.  Take a look at flying to Grand Forks, often flights are cheaper. From GF it would be about a 2.5-3hr drive to the floatbase."
667859,troutologist,2012-02-19 15:12:00,951,"  They are American Truck Tracks out of MI, the Matt Tracks are pretty pricey....its amazing how much more weight distribution these offer over tires, where I was sinking to bare ice (6"") Lee was barely marking the surface of the snow.   Can't wait to finish hanging drywall and see what the evening bite will bring on the lake."
667872,Joey,2012-02-19 15:53:00,9122,"Wow, nice eye, and a pretty neat ""snowmobile"" there"
667912,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-19 18:57:00,0,"nice redemption buddy... maybe i'll get some redemption next weekend to make up for this one! haha dave's sled broke down so we weren't able to access all the remote lakes...
