667827,Dutchy,2012-02-19 06:25:00,416,"The best way of treating arthritis is to target tumour necrosis factor alpha which is secreted by the inflammatory cells. TNF alpha is very damaging and sort of causes a perfect storm as it causes joint cells to secrete more TNF alpha which then recruits more inflammatory cells. The current best medications on the market are etanercept and infliximab. These are recombinant antibodies which are injected into the joint and neutralize the TNF alpha and it last for about 6-8 weeks. So you need multiple injections. Problem is that they are expensive and most healthcare providers baulk at paying it. Its about $14,000 per year. They do work though. There are currently clinical trials going on which target TNF alpha using gene therapy, ie they inject DNA into the joints which switch off TNF alpha in the cells. Unfortunately there is no one size fits all treatment.  The other thing is if you are overweight, drop it as quickly as possible. The heavier you are the worse the joints will deteriorate. Obviously if it in your thumbs, this is irrelevant"

I have tried everything prescribed and some that are legally illegal. The only thing that I found that helps is heat and massage therapy, just spent a week in Punta Cana and felt good the whole week.  You will have to try different meds until you find a good mixture for you. Hopefully it won't cut down on your fishing time like it did mine.  Good Luck and keep up posted."

664240,bigbuck,2012-02-07 01:15:00,2449,Try Nutriflex along with fish oil supplements. Give that a month or two before you start taking heavy meds that will end up messing something else up. Good luck.
664250,JCRG,2012-02-07 01:31:00,57," X2 the best evidence is on low impact exercise if osteoarthritis, swimming in a heated pool is an excellent exercise choice. Rheumatoid arthritis and other of the inflammatory conditions are a little more complex and will require guidance from a rheumatologist Good luck"

I  take 40 mg of uloric a day for my gout and take colchicine three times a day if I experience an attack in the great toe, ankles or knees...If the other areas are bad enough I will take a percocet at bedtime but usually not more than one...between the colchicine causing diahherea and the percs causing constipation you can get a real war going on inside...the best rub for the thumbs I've found for me is Voltaren emulsion...

Just to tell me how severe it is and how will it effect me in a long term perspective. I have had issues with my back,a mild agrivating pain for many years. Now all of a sudden every bloody joint hurts like heck(putting it mildy). Now I know for a fact that stress(esp extreme stress) can flare up a dormant issue.  Today I went for a full scan in which was totally uncomfortable but I had no choice in the matter. After that I called into work and took the day off, i was of no use at all. At this point it was almost noon and decided I needed to excercise the areas that hurt the most. My legs and feet, so I went for a drive and short walks.   My hands , wrists and esp my shoulders were killing me so the best way as I was told is to warm them up by excercising and so i did.  A new solstace 4000, an old rod and a few new lures to join me. And it worked  Not 100% but it did  Who said fishing wasnt theraputic, 0 for 2(trout) today but who cares. Im back in the game, just a little slower this round  in body that is"
664584,pikehunter,2012-02-08 12:01:00,1659,"Both knees, ostio arthitis. Had the right scoped a few years ago to clean up my memiscus and he cleaned up some arthrits, had synvisc shots and multipule cortizone shots in both knees. Going to probably have my left knee scoped soon for a shredded memiscus I hope, but artritis will still be an issue as well as my messed up kneecap. Tried high doses of advil and it helps me a little, tried aleave too with the same results, T3 too and I don't like the effect and taken Oxy rarely but I don't take it and find that it doesn't help the pain, only makes my brain say I don't care about it.  Doctor spoke aout a knee replacement but said that I'm too young (55) as it would probably wear out soon anyway because experience tells him that at my age I'm still too active! And I'd be back in a few years for another.  Walking most of the time with a cane now and it helps me to move around easier. I'm afraid of falling if one of my knees gives out, which they do and I don't want to end up on the floor. Getting up from sitting is very painful and it takes some time to get a little flexible. By the time I finish an 8 hour shift at work walking on concrete floors I'm done.  Also I am having my left lower leg swelling up like a balloon, have had 2 ultrasounds and other tests done because they were concerned I may have a blood clot but thankfully no. This doesn't help the knee either and it is as much trouble as the other problems. Then I had the brilliant idea one day that hey! I should take one of my wife's water pills! That will take the swelling down. Little did I know that they have sulpha in them, I'm allergic to it! I spent the next 5 days scratching hives! And have scars on my swollen leg from the hives that broke the skin from scratching. More bullcrap! to deal with.  And yes I agree I have to drop some weight which would help."

Any other suggestions are more than welcome. Thanks a ton guys"
