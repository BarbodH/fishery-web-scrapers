The more active fish are away from the crowds and more willing to play during the weekdays.  My limit of Badboy Whities in 70FOW   Jigging Rap Lakers   Whitefish doing the chase, 20 feet vertical takeoff to hijack my lure.   Good luck out there, while ice is still here! Please stay away from my sonar, my Showdown is extremely sensitive to rivals."
667346,MJL,2012-02-17 02:16:00,2427," Sensitive wouldn't be the right word to use...More like ""destructive to other people's sonars"".LOL  My Humminbird only has 3 levels of noise control  Definitely itching to get out on the ice this weekend!"

667371,Wolf 3,2012-02-17 03:06:00,134,Nice fish young_one.
667414,Aaron Shirley,2012-02-17 04:39:00,655,Nice fish. Well done. Good thing you can fish on weekdays lol  I haven't been on Simcoe once this winter for the reasons you stated. I'm stuck fishing weekends and not interested in that zoo!
667416,BillM,2012-02-17 04:49:00,17367,"Aaron, you could probably make a few bucks out there on Sat directing traffic!  Bring your STOP sign  :)"
667435,misfish,2012-02-17 10:45:00,29133,  LOL   Nice fish. Better get while the gettings good. Who knows how long it will last.
