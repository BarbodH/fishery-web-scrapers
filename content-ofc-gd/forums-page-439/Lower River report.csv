667655,corvette1,2012-02-18 02:13:00,1765,  Went down to the Lower River today.......visability was less than a foot.  Got one rainbow on a kwickfish and two browns on shinners.  It was about a 40 minute bite.  
667662,Joeytier,2012-02-18 02:32:00,3990,Good fishin.  How do you like those lake o. browns?  I used to catch them by the fistful in the winter but never kept since everyone I talked to said the meat looked and felt more like mashed potatoes than flesh.
667666,Leecher,2012-02-18 02:43:00,7832,Attaboy Corvy  Great job  Some good eats for the smoker

667836,Billy Bob,2012-02-19 13:06:00,5865,Nice fish.......all I keep hearing is the river will NOT clear up this year.....no ice on Erie and lots of wind and some rain is not a good recipe for the lower river.
