667461,Nipfisher,2012-02-17 14:42:00,2449,"Introducing 	The Perfect Small Car for Women      Renault 	and Ford have recently joined forces to create what many critics call ""the 	perfect small car for women.""  By 	mixing the best qualities of the Renault 'Clio' and the Ford 	'Taurus,' 	they have launched the exciting new 'Clitaurus,' which comes only in 	pink.  According to the manufacturer, the average male car thief won't 	be able to find it - let alone turn it on - even if someone tells him where 	it is and how to do it.  The 	Clitaurus does have a few drawbacks, however.  Car and Driver Magazine 	reports that it leaks transmission fluid once a month and ""can 	be a real bugger to start in the morning.""      Some 	reports indicate that in particularly cold weather, you won't be able to get 	it to turn over no matter what you try.  New 	models are fun to own initially, but quickly become very costly to maintain 	and horribly expensive to get rid of.  Used 	models may initially appear to have curb appeal and a low price, but quickly 	develop an increased appetite for fuel, and curb weight typically increases 	noticeably with age.  Manufacturers 	are also baffled when trying to explain how the size of the trunk seems to 	expand with time, justifying the phenomena by arguing that the pink paint 	may cause the trunk to look bigger than it is.  This 	model is not expected to reach collector status.  Informed owners 	suggest that it is best to lease one and replace it each year."
