667705,Pigeontroller,2012-02-18 13:26:00,2793, I guess they moved it...To the International center on Dixon road...
667707,gordy28,2012-02-18 13:44:00,638,"Favourite thing to do as a kid was to go there with my brother a grandfather. He always let us get one of the big grab bags for $5-remember those?  Just a brown paper lunch bag filled with a few cheap lures, always a bobber and a pack of hooks.  I'll never forget the year my brother scored and there was a little jackknife in the pack.  My grandfather let him keep it as long as we didn't tell my Mom. Also loved the b ig ice creams cones-the ones where its a square or two squares of ice cream that they cover in chocolate and nuts.  Good times"
667708,bigugli,2012-02-18 13:44:00,6138,"Those shows were an annual event when I was a kid when we lived in TOronto. Hopping on the Bathurst ""car"" to the CNE loop.  Spending a whole day there and still not seeing it all. Have to admit I went through all of last year's fishing show in all of 2 1/2 hours but I spent a lot more time yakking with folks I knew."
666934,Pigeontroller,2012-02-16 02:26:00,2793,"Oh, yeah, and we only use that nice coloured money up here!"
667172,16 Footer,2012-02-16 20:16:00,191,"  On Friday it is half price admission if you are a senior, $6."

667199,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-16 21:33:00,698,"Call me simple but I enjoy walking around, catching some of the seminars and just looking at fishing stuff and boats. Fun way to spend an afternoon and costs about the same as going to a movie."
667203,Snidley,2012-02-16 21:40:00,620,"Just got an email from Mike at Fishing World. They are NOT attending ANY Fishing /Sportsmans shows this year. They are looking for in house sales and an improved web effort. They do not have any sales until March. Le Baron is not attending but is holding a no tax sale that started yesterday. I stand corrected if Pro J is attending as well as Tightlines as they are both great vendors. Still I'm not sure the show is worth attending from the perspective of good deals since in my experience its Le Baron, Fishing World and Grimsby Tackle that offered decent discounts on tackle and none of them are at the show. Some of the others have good stuff but at the regular/high prices that seem to be the norm here in Canada."
667246,boombap,2012-02-16 23:02:00,310," Le Barons no tax sale is only when you buy a rod/reel, it ends this Saturday.  I picked up a shimano crucial.. no tax!!"
667247,hirk,2012-02-16 23:04:00,571,Snidley lebarons has never been part of the fishing show and as far as deals they will there just like last yr and the yr before and before that. You just have to look for deals. I had a both last yr with everything 25% off and other dealers had great promo's as well so put the pipe down .
667248,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-16 23:04:00,2690,"It's been so many years since I've been to any of the shows I'm happy to just go and spend a day being surrounded by the sport I love!! Don't really care if I get a ""deal"" or not."
667250,backbay,2012-02-16 23:20:00,773,"^^^^Works for me! My kids love the Rapala simulator, on top of it..."
667251,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 23:21:00,10439,  They most certainly were part of the spring fishing show at one point. In fact they had the largest booth as well. Back in it's hey day the spring fishing show was the most anticipated show as it had the most fishing related stuff going on and not a bunch of non-fishing related stuff like the Toronto Sportsmans Show did. The first few years the spring fishing show was held in Pickering and it then moved to the International Center. I don't remember when the big vendors started disappearing but I think it was in the late 80's. I stopped going shortly after LeBarons left the show (only because it coincided with a bunch of other large vendors leaving).
667293,silveradosheriff,2012-02-17 00:35:00,1025,Lebarons has been there.....last time I recall is 2006 though. I remember this as I bought my onboard charger for my then new boat.  :-)
667296,Snidley,2012-02-17 00:43:00,620,"Like Drifter said. I suppose deals are subjective. 25% off what original retail price would be one question I would start with. I'll stand with what I said about the deals issue. No question seeing new stuff and meeting friends is also worth $12 to most anglers BUT at some point the cost of goods effects all hobbies including angling. I for one hope Mike and the boys at Fishing World get in the swing of internet based stores because when I watch the sales of goods on Tackle Warehouse, American Legacy Fishing, Tackle Experts, Land Big Fish, FishandSave, FFO-Tackle, Overstock Bait and Tackle, Fish USA etc I realize just how out of wack the price of fishing gear is up here (with the exception of Le Barons and Fishing World...sometimes) and to date I have yet to see a viable web based fishing site in Canada including the new Cabelas site based in Manitoba."
667337,hirk,2012-02-17 02:06:00,571,"I dont ever remember lebarons doing anything but the sportsman show but i've been wrong before:). No the 25% off was on stuff already priced competitively below msrp.I mentioned in another post that I matched or beat tacklewarehouse pricing on abu everyday so I wouldnt say that things are cheaper by a wide margin down south. You have to factor in freight,duties,brokerage fees and exchange rates that add to the product cost here since most of it is imported from the US when you see a spread in pricing, it doesnt mean the profits are higher for Canadian retailers."
667379,hammercarp,2012-02-17 03:15:00,964,Us carp guys will be there in building 4 by the Fly Casting pool. Drop by and say hi.
667391,Duckie,2012-02-17 03:39:00,305,"I went to last years show and I loved it.  fishing world was there, saw my friend Steve who works there at the booth.  bought a G. Loomis TSR791 rod for $250 including tax (not a deal because this is what this rod goes for but I couldn't find this rod anywhere else and wanted to physically handle it before buying).  its now my favorite rod (im an UL fanatic)  got to play with the new rods/reels etc.  however, the actual hall with all the fishing stuff was not well advertised.  people were leaving saying there wasn't much stuff.  thats because they were in the wrong hall that had mainly the boating/camping stuff etc.  i will be taking a peek this year too. fun way to kill 2 hours."
667395,BillM,2012-02-17 03:49:00,17367,The best was when it was held at the International Center on Dixon Rd.  That used to be an annual event for the oldman and I when I was a kid..  Deals everywhere!  Now?  Not so much....
667536,NANUK,2012-02-17 19:27:00,797,"The best deal for me, everything I love is under one roof, check out all models of rods, reels, tackle and other fishing related items, Talk to the reps at different booths about their product, attend seminars, I just make a day out of it, Its entertainment and a full day of fun for less then going to a movie, Not much else is there to do this time of year for me. As for saving $$$$ deals, I can find deals all through the season, you just have to watch what you need, there is always a deal to be had somewhere."
667553,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-17 20:35:00,1622,"If you don`t go to the Show you likely won`t see these guys at another in the area Bass Magnet Lures, Frostbite, Water Wolf & X Zone, always nice to see their new products in person rather than over the Net Tight Lines SBK"
667566,ah_long,2012-02-17 21:16:00,354,"not too many deals, at least not the stuff I want  Radio world has half price on St Croix ice combos and St Croix Legend Ice Rods  I picked up a Dobyns 705CB Glass from Pro J because they're the only one carrying Dobyns  I saw some good deals on fish finders/sonars at radio world..."
667572,misfish,2012-02-17 21:29:00,29133,"Oh to be a kid again,and think it was the show,the one you looked forward to every year with your pop. Thats the problem IMO. They need to make it like a candy store. Saddly, it,s not anymore."
667575,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 21:42:00,10439," Exactly!!! Back in the early days the show was awesome and we would spend the whole day going through all the vendors, manufacturers and outfitters booths. Now you can do it in an hour."
667580,Henricus,2012-02-17 22:06:00,118,"I agree with Stonefish.  Being able to handle all the different products you have an interest in is worth the price of admission.  Last year I had a g loomis pro put an NRX through its paces for me.  Although I could 't swallow the cost at the time, I ended up buying one from JB's later in the year.  Listening to a speaker or two is always beneficial also and although I'm not in the market for a boat, it's great to check out the new features.  The show might not be what it used to be but it sure beats the winter blues, if only for a few hours."
667588,Billy Bob,2012-02-17 22:33:00,5865," YES.......back then everything to ""me"" and sounds like to ""you"" were better because we if fact did experience the early day SPORTSMEN SHOWS that were in fact awesome.....but now it all about getting more money for the company that is sponsoring that particular booth.....  Now each and every booth is about separating you from you money all while the poor sap working that booth is getting almost nothing to be there..."
667630,silveradosheriff,2012-02-18 00:34:00,1025,"Not bad savings....got everything on my list, which reduces the hassle factor of running around!  Full retail would have been $360....got it for $285 including admission and got to see some kewl rides and hear and tell some fishy stories...."
667693,misfish,2012-02-18 10:20:00,29133,"  Don,t forget about the wooden carts that were outside with the best popcorn ever and those roasting nuts and cotton candy."
665915,boombap,2012-02-12 23:34:00,310,So this coming weekend will be the 5th annual spring fishing and boat show. I have never been but I am looking to pick up a new rod and reel before spring.  Do the booths hold any good deals? Is it worth to not buy at BPS or Lebarons and wait?  http://springfishingandboatshow.com
665916,danbouck,2012-02-12 23:35:00,4380,

666095,bigbuck,2012-02-13 16:42:00,2449,There are always a deal or two to be had at the shows. I  go to take a look and see what's out there. Great way to pass an afternoon.
666129,uglyfish,2012-02-13 18:28:00,981,"It really is more of a spectacle rather then a place for deals. Definately a fun place to spend a day. As said, always a deal or 2, just gotta keep ur eyes open."
666198,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-13 23:06:00,10439,There are always great deals on sunglasses and sausages at the show.
666200,Roy,2012-02-13 23:09:00,13728," If you're lucky you could score on aluminum windows, magic car wax, no stick fry pans and best of all, lures that have been banned in 3 states!"
666219,Pigeontroller,2012-02-14 00:01:00,2793,Show up Sunday morning! There just might be some great deals by bidding on the Silent Auction!!!
666220,I'mHooked,2012-02-14 00:09:00,525, See you there Dax.
666323,Garnet,2012-02-14 13:02:00,2056,Redwing Tackle will have their new float reel at this show.
666344,charlesn,2012-02-14 14:35:00,551,"People complain about the safety kits, socks, shamwow and other cheesy booths, but if not for them filling the booth space - the organizers might decide to can it altogether.  To some that would be no big loss - but to some vendors it's a hefty portion of their yearly income.  I don't think I've actually bought anything at a spring show in 10 years so I'm probably not an expert on the ""deals"" available.  I just go to walk around - see guys that I fish against that I haven't seen all winter - check out some new products.  It's cheap entertainment.  No parking fees, lots of free seminars, lots of informative and top notch anglers.  Lots of fellow fishing fanatics.  You can sense the cabin fever starting to break.  To me it has always been the signal that winter is winding down and fishing is just around the corner.  Perhaps earlier this year than most.  And it beats sitting at home doin' nothing.  Go without any big expectations of finding a deal of a lifetime and you'll probably enjoy yourself more.  People like to say how ""awesome"" the deals used to be and whatnot - but I've been going to the spring shows since about '95 or '96 and it hasn't changed all that much in terms of the ""deals"" offered at least as far as I can tell.  Most of the time getting acquainted with a local retailer and earning perks and discounts through loyalty will get you better pricing on whatever you need in the long run.  Charles"
666346,Harrison,2012-02-14 14:59:00,2202,"Well said Charles, hope to bump into you there."
666369,lew,2012-02-14 16:23:00,12766,"Charles nailed it !!  Nobody ever said these shows are always gonna save you big $$$$ on gear, but you may find some deals. I know I saved ALOT of money when I purchased my boat there a couple years back, but even if you don't find the bargains it's still a great way to spend a day.  Just don't go looking for a bottle of water if your thirsty cause they charge STUPID prices for those."
666507,Pigeontroller,2012-02-14 23:22:00,2793,"You said it Lew! Its a great way to spend a February day. You might run into some friends, socialize a bit. I will be there all day Friday, all afternoon Saturday, and most of the day Sunday...Either in or near the Muskies Canada booth."

You want a real deal....DON'T spend the money to get in, DON'T spend the money for parking and DON'T spend the money on the overpriced food and that new rod/reel combo is NOW FREE.....  Twenty years ago or MORE the sportsmen shows were a place to find deals and have a good time without spending a lot of money to just get in.....now it's nothing more then a money grab... "
666662,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-15 13:27:00,627,"Gee I don't see where spending fourteen dollars admission fee is a money grab. Parking is free, the seminars are free, the comraderie is free. Everything else is a bonus."
666676,charlesn,2012-02-15 14:22:00,551, I'll look for ya Phill.  Good luck with the show!
666749,Snidley,2012-02-15 18:01:00,620,"There sure won't be much in the way of deals since there are only 3 retail tackle stores attending this show, Natural Sports, JB's and the guy from Hwy 400. That's got to be the poorest turnout for stores ever. I've always heard complaints from the tackle vendors claiming the whole excercise is a futile effort I guess now they are acting on it. Maybe the Sportsmans show will be better this year."
666776,Grimace,2012-02-15 19:51:00,2020,I just went to the site and noticed they are bringing in a boxer to sell t-shirts.  It's getting pretty weird.  Lol.
666795,hirk,2012-02-15 20:49:00,571,"Snidley you have been misinformed, there are other vendors attending such as Tight lines for sure and likely Fishing World along with Pro J's."
666797,irishfield,2012-02-15 21:07:00,26272,"Apparently there is also a boat show in Hamilton this weekend. I only know this as the ""New"" Naden boat will be represented at it.
