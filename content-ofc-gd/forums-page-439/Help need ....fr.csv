667284,Big Cliff,2012-02-17 00:20:00,6899,"One of the nicest things about this board is that we all do the best we can. Money is tight for many right now and for many putting food on the table or paying the mortgage is the necissity.  I know we've had to cut back a little this year. There are several things up for auction that I would love to bid on but just can't afford to this year and I am sure that many others are in the same boat.  Don't panic guys, there is still time and whatever we manage to raise will be appreciated as the best we could do!"
