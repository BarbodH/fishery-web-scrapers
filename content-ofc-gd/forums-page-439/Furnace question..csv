667860,Tybo,2012-02-19 15:12:00,1373,I replaced the furnace this year and I was wondering if I could use a element filter on the air intake. I would still use the furnace filter also.

Anytime you put an obstacle in a flow environment, whether liquid, or in your case air, you will either speed up, or slow down the flow. In this case, a filter media may slow down airflow in the heating chamber and cause the furnace to overheat. I""m not saying this will happen for sure, just logically speaking.  Paul"
667904,NARDA1,2012-02-19 18:39:00,6,I'm no pro either but I've used a 1 inch thick pleated filter on the air return grille along with the 3 inch filter that is located at the furnace with no issues.
667915,Tybo,2012-02-19 19:07:00,1373," It's not the filter in the house I'm asking about,But the fresh air induct.Kind a like a cold air induction on a engine.Element filters are washable.This way it would help to prolong the filter in the furnace keeping cost down on filter changes.For I would not be sucking in dust from outside."
667929,NARDA1,2012-02-19 19:47:00,6,"There should be no reason to filter that air, unless you are in a very dirty / dusty enviroment because it is only used for cumbustion. any debris would be burned."
