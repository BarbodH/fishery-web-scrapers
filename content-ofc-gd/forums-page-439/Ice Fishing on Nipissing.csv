I'm pretty excited and just want to ask anyone out there for some friendly advice on good lures/depth/method to catch any of the following:  Perch? Walleye? Pike? Ling??  I'm all ears.  Cheers,  Dan"
658477,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 16:05:00,5784,"Some of the recent threads (top 4 pages) should give you a good idea of what is working. At the very least, a Nipissing rig AKA minnow and hook works best. If you get a chance, stop at North Bay outfitters and pick up a Jaxon spoon or two, they have produced better than average for perch, ling and walleye."
658575,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 23:12:00,2449,Yep. Search Nipissing on this board and read. PM me if you a specific question and I will try to help you out.

667756,dbick,2012-02-18 23:26:00,18,"Hey all,  The fishing trip was a great time, I really enjoyed my first ice fishing experience at Fish Bay Marina. When the fishing was slow the food, drinks, and the pursuit of fun made things great. Things were pretty quite though; the group of 18 caught about 10 perch, 1 pike (23 inch) and one real nice walleye (23 3/4 inch). Oh yeah, and 4 mud puppies and one PIG!! Yeah, a pig. We brought up a 40lb pig and spit and had a pig roast!  Thanks for the tips.  Dangler"
