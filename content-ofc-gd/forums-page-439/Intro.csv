666755,steel&chrome,2012-02-15 18:38:00,46,"Hey All!!  Just wanted to introduce myself, i must say, i've been lurking the forum for a week or so now and i've yet to find any other forum as friendly as you guys!!! I've been fishing for a while now and regardless of what it is, i just enjoy the awesomeness of what nature has to offer. But as you can tell from my login, im absolutely crazy about chrome!!. With that being said, i just had a quick question for you guys...what would be some safe options to ice fish for pike this weekend from around 2 hours from toronto??? I was going to find some back bays off of georgian bay or other lakes but made a few calls to some local hotels in the honey harbour area and they've been telling people to stay off...  Thanks!  steel&chrome"

I am not to sure about Georgian Bay but Lake Simcoe has some decent puke in there and is alot less then 2 hours.  I am sure a bit further north there are some more productive pike lakes.  Good luck.
666760,kickingfrog,2012-02-15 19:02:00,8333,Welcome. We're not as friendly once we get to know you.;-)  Ice is a tricky thing because it can change daily/ hourly. Cooks bay does produce some pike and is closer to you.

667075,BillM,2012-02-16 15:26:00,17367, I'd call the marina for the latest up to date conditions..  I tried to fish a spot on one of the Muskoka lakes yesterday and it was WIDE open..  Food for thought.
