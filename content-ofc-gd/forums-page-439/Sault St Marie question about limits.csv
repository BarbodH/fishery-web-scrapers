666588,superdad,2012-02-15 02:47:00,353,"I watched a Canadian Sportfishing show and he was at the Soo for their July Kiwanis Derby and each boat was allowed five fish and they brought in some really nice fish.  I was checking the Regs for 2011 and for 2012 and read that in Zone 9, Walleye limit was 2 for an 'S' licence and in Zone 10, the limit was four with only one over 18.1 inches for an 'S' licence.  Can anyone explain what was going on there?  Really wondering, even Italo referred me to the derby web site.  David  aka  Superdad"
666594,BillM,2012-02-15 03:05:00,17367,5 fish per boat no?  I watched the same show but didn't pay close attention to the derby rules.
666596,kickingfrog,2012-02-15 03:09:00,8333,I think zone 14 has a 6 walleye limit and that might be where the derby was but I'm not really familiar with that area.
666597,gaspumper,2012-02-15 03:13:00,393,"The way I read your reply is your allowed 4 fish with one being over 18.1 in. for two people you would be allowed to catch 8 fish total,but the derby only allowed a catch of 5 fish per boat,so you would be under the total allowed.Or am I reading it wrong?"
666603,BillM,2012-02-15 03:32:00,17367,They were fishing Zone 14.
666691,Targa01,2012-02-15 15:20:00,46,"Hi Superdad, I fished that tournament and it was on the St. Mary's river system. We were allowed to fish from the locks in the Soo to lake Huron. I am unsure what zone that is but I know St Mary's river is considered apart of the great lakes and I think it is open all year for walleye like lake Erie but I'm not 100% sure. There is no slot size on the river and the limit is 5 or 6 walleyes per angler but for the tournament we were only allowed 5 walleyes per boat ( 2 fisherman in each boat) and a minimum of 15 in because we were allowed to fish the USA side of the river and that's there regulations. Where Italo was fishing was on the Canadian side of lake George. I will find out the regs for you."
666838,superdad,2012-02-15 22:51:00,353,"Thanks for your replies, Targa01 made mention of Zone 14 and that's the answer to the question, special regs for the St Marys River.  David  aka  Superdad"
666869,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-16 00:47:00,0,saw this late... haven't seen the episode but I heard some familiar faces were guiding Italo and Barb on day one.
666993,TDunn,2012-02-16 05:58:00,680, Ya I watched the episode on youtube. Seen Matt and Aaron a few times throughout the show.      TDunn
667376,Joeytier,2012-02-17 03:09:00,3990,"As far as I know, there aren't any zones in Ontario with a sport limit of walleye over 4 anymore."
667382,irishfield,2012-02-17 03:17:00,26272," St. Marys River - from the gates of the Compensating Works downstream to longitude 83°45’W. which extends from Eagle Point (Hay Bay) south to the international boundary with the United States. Two lines may be used when trolling from a boat in open water. Walleye open from Jan. 1 - last day in Feb. & May 15 - Dec. 31. Walleye S - 4 and C -2, any size. Northern pike - any size.  In Zone 13 you can possess 6 fish on a sport licence."
