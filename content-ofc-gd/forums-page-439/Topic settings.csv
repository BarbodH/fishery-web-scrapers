I want to know what others are thinking about a particular subject. But I would like to stop receiving emails to the topic ""What song are you listening to now?""  Can we kill that thread and start a new one?  That way I will no longer have to receive those emails?  I know, I know, first world problems, cry me a river....haha.  Does anyone else share my sentiments?  Thanks."
