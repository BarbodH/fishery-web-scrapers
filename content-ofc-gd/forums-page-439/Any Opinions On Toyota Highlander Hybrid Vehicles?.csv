666680,registerfly,2012-02-15 14:42:00,198," are those realistic numbers? what did they say about a deal that looks too good it might be a sign to pass on it. I may be out of the loop on resale $ but that just sounds way off to me... This is from a dealer or private? Do you know the owner if private? If it's a dealer at that cost I would run from it. Just my $.02  BTW stay away from the Liberty, just saw a terrible write up recently from owners reports through the Star."
666689,solopaddler,2012-02-15 15:03:00,8605,"  One of my strengths is finding deals, I have a knack for it what can I say?  It's an estate sale. Talked to the son a couple days ago and am quite comfortable that everything is on the up and up. It's an '07 Highlander Hybrid with 56K on the odometer. He faxed me copies of all the pertinent paperwork including the vehicles history a couple days ago and everything looks good.  I can also have the vehicle checked by a local mechanic of my choice.   There is however a slight catch, it's located in Edmonton LOL!  That said I've already looked into one way flights and can get one for $240 tax in.  He said he'd pick me up at the airport as well.  I'd have to drive the vehicle home, however that's not all that bad.  I foresee a possible pitstop at Lake Winnipeg and Lac Seul enroute home for some ice fishing.  I love doing stuff like this, it's kind of an adventure.  Just have to make a quick decision and get a bit of time off work which may not be that easy."
666697,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-15 15:35:00,10439," Before you head East, head North for a 12 hour drive and come ice fish with me Mike."
666758,FUSION,2012-02-15 18:59:00,81," I have to agree here, that year vehicle with that miliage should be selling anywere from $25k to 28k. Why anyone estate sale or not would take that kind of ""bath"" on it baffles my brain. You would get more pushing it into the dealer on trade than $12k... I just can't believe anybody would start at 12k on a vehicle thats worth easily double that on the market unless there is a problem somewere, especially on a Toyota that has a strong resale value and reputation."
666771,solopaddler,2012-02-15 19:44:00,8605,Oh yea of little faith.
666788,jedimaster,2012-02-15 20:31:00,3472,"Pretty happy with my liberty, not a lick of trouble. I know several other liberty owners that haven't had any issues with them as well."

666865,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 00:39:00,10439,Mike If you get this vehicle does that mean we can call you Captain Highlander?
666884,BillM,2012-02-16 01:08:00,17367,Maybe we can finally get him to change that license plate Dave!   :)
666885,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 01:10:00,10439," Nah, he paid good money for it. Too bad he can't spell!!!"

666948,ecmilley,2012-02-16 02:41:00,2163,"batterys are designed to last 10 years or better in the hybrids, it's running them down and not charging them that shortens there service life, now what i remember most from my hybrid training is ""don't screw with the orange wire"" one of our shop vehicles was a 2007 lexus 400h, sorry can't really say anthing great about it it was well made and comfy but driving it felt weird, i suggest you drive one for a day, everytime i backed up i though for sure i was gonna hit something, confindence issue for sure but with a vehicle going in reverse with no engine running then kicking in is unerving to me just couldn't get used to it, but its sounds like a great deal go for it if you like it"
667024,Fish4Eyes,2012-02-16 13:03:00,1022,I herd a cab driver in BC got 325k on the batteries on a Prius hybrid. Thats good if you ask me. It would be well worth the purchase if you plan to drive the car in the city alot.

667497,Rice Laker,2012-02-17 17:00:00,24,Silly question: If and when the hybrid battery dies can you just run the car like a regular gas powered Highlander?

667723,bucktail,2012-02-18 16:34:00,1857,"Hey Mike    Its a little light on the towing cxapacity if that is a concern for you.  I was at the dealer 2 weeks ago and noticed it didnt have the same towig capacity as my FJ.   And I feel for you with everything going wrong, no idea why things do that all at once but they do it and it can suck!    Darren"
666247,solopaddler,2012-02-14 01:41:00,8605,I've done my due diligence and researched what I could online. Any thoughts from you guys on the Highlander hybrids?  I'm specifically looking at an 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid with super low km's.  What say you? Any pros or cons?
666249,pics,2012-02-14 01:50:00,1268,What is the battery life? Even with moderate use the batteries age and lose the ability to hold a charge over the course of 5 years. New ones could be very expensive but then again since it's a Toyota the quality is excellent..
666251,Roy,2012-02-14 01:56:00,13728,"Is there an off switch for the traction control on that model, Mike."
666260,BillM,2012-02-14 02:24:00,17367,"Highlanders aren't known for their mileage, even the hybrids  Other then that you're getting a bulletproof drivetrain, proven reliability, etc..  Very capable offroad as well (Depending on the options it's got)"
666264,cram,2012-02-14 02:28:00,1733,"Roy hit the nail on the head.  Pretty sure you can't turn it off, which means you can get stuck in the snow.  Opt for gas - the mileage is actually pretty good. Love highlanders too."
666273,solopaddler,2012-02-14 02:45:00,8605,"Thanks for the feedback guys.  My only concern with this vehicle is possible replacement of the batteries. I'm just not sure if that will be an issue or not. If it is it's expensive.  Under normal circumstances I'd go with a gas vehicle every time. I'm looking at this one solely because the price is so ridiculously cheap I can't afford not to. No way would I ever pay normal market value for a hybrid.  On a side note it seems everything's going to hell in a handbasket lately.  Since we've been back from Cuba my washing machine died, my furnace is not functioning properly and needs repairs, the new water heater started leaking, both computers in the house are fubar, and to top it off our car is dying (hence the search).  I kid you not every day it's been something else. LOL!"
666274,JTorra,2012-02-14 02:47:00,50,"I have the Lexus 400H. Very similar. Share drivetrains and some other parts. Give me a call and I'll give you the skinny. Billy, mileage is good. He will not trying be to spin the tires on a Duramax at 80 km/Hr!"
666275,BillM,2012-02-14 02:51:00,17367, I plead the 5th!
666280,Roy,2012-02-14 03:15:00,13728,Bottom line Mike is that I would buy one if the price was as good as you say it is. It's a solid ride. The only thing I'd be concerned about is getting stuck in sand or snow and having to get towed out by a Volkswagen.  Now that would burn me.
666285,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-14 03:40:00,10439, That and the $8K cost for replacing the batteries when the time comes.
666286,GYPSY400,2012-02-14 03:54:00,191,"I'm not sold on the hybrids yet.. The only advantage is city ( low speed) driving.. On the highway the electric stuff is not used, if it is, it's helping the gas engine.. So mileage is not really helped compaired to a straight gas version.. Also, when considering the extra cost for maintaining the cyberspace - that alone can buy a lot of gas.  If your doing a lot of city driving and keeping the vehicle short term - go for it.. If your doing a lot of highway and plan on driving it in the ground, it will never pay off."
666332,John,2012-02-14 13:46:00,2956,"Personally Mike, I'm not a hybrid fan. They don't make sense either economically or eco-friendly wise. I would go diesel in a heartbeat if economy from a larger vehicle is the goal."
666336,Fish4Eyes,2012-02-14 14:13:00,1022,"Good advice above by GYPSY400 and John. I would go VW Taureg TDI or Cherokee CRD if I were you Mike. I have personally driven and towed my boat with the Taureg TDI and it is amazing. I did not even feel the boat on the back, whereas with my 4Runner I know damn well its there. My brother went on a road trip to Florida in the Taureg TDI and averaged 11L/100km driving 120+ish almost the whole way. Mercedes makes the engine that is in the Cherokee CRD, enough said. If you decide to get a Toyota, make sure you don't take it to Red Hill Toyota for anything other than an oil change as they have tried to screw me around. Miraculously, every single bolt ""seized"" on my 4Runner when they went to change my timing belt and water pump. Lets just say they were quick to reverse the 6 additional hours of labour they tried to charge me. I wont even get into inexperienced ""mechanics"" not being able to diagnose a problem. Good luck with your purchase."
666338,BillM,2012-02-14 14:16:00,17367,"The Touareg TDI is a 70k vehicle....  Also, I don't think Mike is going to do much towing (if any)...  Those two vehicles are complete overkill."
666352,solopaddler,2012-02-14 15:20:00,8605,"Thanks lads once again your input is appreciated.     I'm not necessarily a hybrid fan either. The only goal I have is finding a cheap set of wheels LOL!     No need to warn me about Red Hill. A while back I had a small 4X4 Toyota pickup and made the mistake of getting it serviced there.  Let's just say my experience was similar to yours.  Without getting into the details, they were refusing to own up to their shennanigans and would do nothing further for me....until I walked into their service dept which happened to be filled with customers and started asking them why in a VERY loud voice LOL!"
666358,Uncle Buck,2012-02-14 15:25:00,1000,Hybrid Battery life is around 5 years... which is where you are with the vehicle right now...  you don't want to know what it would cost to change it...  As for the Highlander... My brother while working up in the oil sands in alberta raved about it...  said it had the least amount of problems out of all the site vehicles... these were abused day in day out in extreme conditions  and the highlander stood their ground he says
666392,troutologist,2012-02-14 17:28:00,951,"  On my Tacoma, you need to hold down the traction control switch for 6 or 8 seconds to turn it completely off...not sure if it is the same on the highlander."

666621,cram,2012-02-15 05:39:00,1733,"Like Roy said, you could get stuck in the snow.  Highlanders are great, but get a regular gas version."
666623,Ice_ice,2012-02-15 08:49:00,18,"Bottom line - go to Whitby Toyota, ask for Andrew and get the car you really want. Lol Toyotas are all right."
666626,solopaddler,2012-02-15 10:33:00,8605," If Andrew can get me into an '07 with less than 60K for under $12,000 I'm all ears.  'Cause that's what I'm looking at right now."
666629,Billy Bob,2012-02-15 10:38:00,5865,  Errrrrr....bottom line would be a GM product....  Toyota is the TOP of the Line....with TUNDRA leading the way....
666657,Fish4Eyes,2012-02-15 13:04:00,1022, I looked into one of these and the reviews on them are horrible. There is a reason they partnered with Mercedes to make a diesel engine to go in the Cherokee.
666664,Mike the Pike,2012-02-15 13:43:00,3421, Mike there are owners with 12 and 13 year old Toyota Prius the still have the original batteries.
