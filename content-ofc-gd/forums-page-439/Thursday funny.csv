The Trooper walks up and taps on the window with his nightstick, the driver rolls down the window and ""WHACK"", the Trooper smacks him in the head with the stick.  The driver says, ""what the heck was that for?""  The Trooper says, ""You're in Alabama boy. When we pulls you over, you better have your license ready when we get to your car.  ""The driver says, ""I'm sorry, Officer, I'm not from around here.""  The Trooper runs a check on the guy's license, and he's clean. He gives the guy his license back and walks around to the passenger side and taps on the window.  The passenger rolls down the window and ""WHACK"", the Trooper smacks him up side the head with the nightstick too.  The passenger says, ""What'd you do that for?""  The Trooper says, ""Just making your wish come true.""  The Passenger says, ""huh?""  The Trooper says, ""I knows that two miles down the road you were gonna say, ""I wish that son of a gun would've tried that crap with me!"""
