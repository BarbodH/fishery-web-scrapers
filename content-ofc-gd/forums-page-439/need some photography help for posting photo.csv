Select the size you want, copy the pics back out of the email and bingo!  Simple resizing in less then 10 seconds  Then upload the photos to Photobucket and copy the IMG information into your thread."

(avoiding lurkers to examine every detail of all your photographs) 3. Easy links to share via forum, email, instant-chats.  Quick and easy turtorial video on Posting photos using photobucket "
