667598,icefisherman,2012-02-17 22:46:00,952,"Nice day today so what better to do then check the rivers for active stealhead....they sure were active...one of my best days this season....8/9 final score...most fish were silver clean and very healthy...just one was colored...some larger then the rest but all full of energy and willing to play and show some pretty good acrobatics...Sorry for the picture quality but again not easy to take good pictures when you are alone with a cell phone, frozen fingers and trying to get the fish back in the water ASAP. Still better than nothing I think....  Few shots from the day for your viewing pleasure:                                      Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
667601,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 23:01:00,10439,Better get 'em while you can 'cause with this unusually warm winter they will just be a memory come opener and will probably already be out in the blue zone.
667622,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-18 00:08:00,2690,"  Which will be a great thing for the bows!!  They are sooo much better in the fall.  That said, way to go Emil.  This is still a fun time to catch them."
667625,misfish,2012-02-18 00:22:00,29133,Very nice Emil.  Nice shooting.
667628,dave524,2012-02-18 00:31:00,4508," ditto.... couple there , especially the first shot look like they may recently spawned out. BTW looks like you had a good day, nice fish"
667667,Leecher,2012-02-18 02:47:00,7832,Awesome chrome Emil     Congrats
667674,limeyangler,2012-02-18 03:06:00,5204,Didn't you just do a report like this last week?  LOL...WTG AGAIN!  That looks like fun.
667679,Dozer,2012-02-18 03:28:00,896,"First fsh looks spawned out  Great report, you have 'em dialed in"

667683,Live2fish85,2012-02-18 03:58:00,1633,Nice job. Those are some beauty steelhead. Can't ask for a better day then that.
667727,icefisherman,2012-02-18 17:20:00,952," Well you are probably right...but they can run and can't hide from me...boat is ready so let them go to the BZ....my favorite spot  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
667781,Djeep,2012-02-19 01:20:00,199,the one male fish looks like gonzo from the muppets
