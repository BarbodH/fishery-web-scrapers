667019,Skipper D,2012-02-16 12:50:00,1970,second picture
667021,Skipper D,2012-02-16 12:54:00,1970,third picture
667023,Skipper D,2012-02-16 13:02:00,1970,"Fourth and final picture , i beleive the space i need to build my fishing boat is complete , just have to wait a bit in order to take the boat out of storage and bring it in , i am excited to get working on it next andi  look forward to the ones here on the board to help me along with all their good ideas and incorperate as many as i can aford into the boat .."
667164,Dozer,2012-02-16 19:37:00,896,"Your shop is soooooooooooo clean, looking good."
662796,Skipper D,2012-02-02 11:54:00,1970,"  Ya redneck , back when things were simpler ............ lol . Bob give us some thing fishing to talk about , you pick it for today , you got some thing you need to understand ."
662797,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 12:04:00,5865," Well, since I can't walk on water and the fishing machine is in winter storage, there is no fishing here to be had....."
662815,OhioFisherman,2012-02-02 13:02:00,6623,"I used to catch my own bait a lot of the time, obviously a size 12-16 hook with the barb flattened to prevent damage to them is going to work better than trying to catch minnows or chubs with a size 2 hook?  For bass, walleye and such I have never seen a need to go smaller than size 1, and the amount of cover in an area can dictate whether I used light wire or heavy wire hooks."
663154,Skipper D,2012-02-03 10:48:00,1970,"Hook size /3 , /2  , 12-16 might be confusing trying to learn it from a forum for a newbie reading it in a post and trying to make sence of it , heres some thing that might help others to understand  what hook numbers mean , the lower the hook number the bigger the hook , i know it did for me"
663157,Skipper D,2012-02-03 11:08:00,1970,"  Thank you for your post Ohiofisherman , it just gave me another idea . Any one know what we might get if we crossed thease two things , family size pop bottle and a jar of dog treats ?????"
663167,OhioFisherman,2012-02-03 12:02:00,6623,"I suppose you could make a minnow trap? It would be wise to check your regulations? Size of the opening? One reason I fished for bait, what I liked to use for it wouldn`t fit thru the opening allowed. Also catching species native to the water you were fishing produced better results."
663171,Skipper D,2012-02-03 12:08:00,1970,"  Well theres a new for me, size opening regulation , any one know what that would be for us in Ontario ?"
663190,Billy Bob,2012-02-03 13:05:00,5865,I use a umbrella net to dip Emerald Shiners out of the Niagara River....there are Billions of them most times.....or you can pay a bait dealer $7 for 4 dozen....
663208,Skipper D,2012-02-03 14:27:00,1970,"  Make a minnow trap you sure can , if any one wants to see how i'd be glad to show'um , with Billy bob using a net  to catch minnows and lets say with me useing a minnow trap do i have to still worried about regulations for the opening on my trap ?"
663394,OhioFisherman,2012-02-04 00:53:00,6623,"Skipper it`s been a long time since I was up there and they have really worked over your regulations. As I recall the opening could be no larger than one inch? No idea if that has changed and I don`t see it stated in the regs, just a size limit for the trap. It used to be legal for us to trap our own bait there, that also changed to residents only."
663415,Skipper D,2012-02-04 02:20:00,1970,"  Theres always some thing new to know , with this home made minnow trap we should be ok , the opening is an inch , unless thats change here , think i'll do what i do best and play stupid til some one tells me differant ..... lol"
663426,spinnerdoc,2012-02-04 02:45:00,556,Haven't heard that in a while...for some reason reminds me of Howard Stern  Try em out Skip that's the best way to find out if yer ideas are good or not
663427,Skipper D,2012-02-04 02:52:00,1970,"  Thanks there spinn , sorry for the bad memory but i think your the one who's holding a rod for me right ?"
663466,spinnerdoc,2012-02-04 13:21:00,556,yup that's me...and the reel too
663468,Skipper D,2012-02-04 13:47:00,1970,  Your moneys growing with intrest .... lol ... we have to cross paths soon .
663770,Skipper D,2012-02-05 18:13:00,1970,"My old thread ""buiding your own custom fishing boat"" is so far gone down the pages on the board , i don't feel like going after it, figure i can pick it up here on this one for those who might be interested . I'd like to post a few pic's like before and after on getting an unused bay in my shop reno'd and made ready to have a place where i can work on the boat in my spare time , theres still more work to do but heres this for now .This is before.................................."
663772,Skipper D,2012-02-05 18:15:00,1970,This now.........................................
663773,Skipper D,2012-02-05 18:18:00,1970,"Some one asked , why reno to work on the boat , this is why and my favorite part as to why , i like my work space comfortable if i am going to do some thing ...lol"
663775,Skipper D,2012-02-05 18:21:00,1970,Another before pic of the junk storage room
663776,Skipper D,2012-02-05 18:25:00,1970,"And now of the same area , Ihave to pick up conduit yet and do the electrical for the new lighting and do a restore to the over head door before i can organize the room with tools and bring the boat in . Just puttering away with the time i have to spend on it from day to day ........lol"
664018,Skipper D,2012-02-06 14:53:00,1970,"A few pic's of the boat that will be getting the make over once the shop reno is finished . Why some ask , why not just buy a new fishing boat , i've always liked the bigger boats with the covered bow which is some thing you can't seem to find in a new fishing boat thease days ."
666963,Skipper D,2012-02-16 03:22:00,1970,After some PM's recieved today showing interest in how things are coming along i am bumping this up . Later tomorrow morning when i am on the other computer where the pictures are i'll post a few for an update to whats happening  .
667003,wormdunker,2012-02-16 11:27:00,1711,"Hey Skip thanx for the info.  Please show us how u make the minnow trap.  Nice looking shop, can I come & PLAY!!  U must be my twin.  I do ALL my work myself, forever tinkering in my garage.  Right now I'm putting the finishing touches on my portable fish hut that folds out in less than 30 seconds (ready to fish)!  It even has retractable wheels for running down a dry road.  When I get to the ice in less than 1 minute the wheels R retracted, the hut is now on skis WOO HOO!"
667005,skeeter,2012-02-16 11:38:00,1907,Keep us updated Ron.
667014,Skipper D,2012-02-16 12:27:00,1970,"  Thats great , feel free to post some pictures here and show all of us what you made , it sounds interesting and i am shure others would like to get a look at it as well ."
662439,Skipper D,2012-02-01 13:57:00,1970,"I would like to share in side this post for the next while  as well as gather information about any thing and every thing to do with fishing . I  will do my best to share what little i know or go find out for others who don't know and ask others here to do the same . My first question to get the ball rolling is .................... this is some thing i do and wonder if others are doing the same or is it just a lost cause ............ i got the idea last summer that i could perhapes control the size of fish i would catch if i was to adjust the size of my hook opening by doing so with a pair of plyers to change the size of the hook , was i thinking stupid or do others do this also  ?"
662456,Nipfisher,2012-02-01 14:55:00,2449,Another .....ummmmmm....interesting thread Skip.  If you open the gap of your hook too much forget about hook set.
662460,solopaddler,2012-02-01 15:09:00,8605,  Yes
662465,Skipper D,2012-02-01 15:20:00,1970,"funny .......... at the time i was trying to come up with a way to keep the gobies from getting on and once i had the hook small enough the bites stoped all together , i never thought about getting the hook to set tho , there were other times when i had fish marking with nothing other then nibbles and open the hooks and got action ........... now i am a guy who has minumal tackle in the box and who is learning from the bottom up and trying to still keep it fun for my self with out running to the tackle shop and spending a fortune to have what the pro's have , still i am not stupid to learn that yes there are some things you can't do with out  , i am not sure how to spell the next word i'd like to use and maybe i can .. utillize is what i like to do with whats in the tackle box if you will ."
662469,Billy Bob,2012-02-01 15:32:00,5865,YES Skippy you are correct.....that is why there are so MANY different hook sizes available....not to mention different kinds of hooks in the same size....it's pretty much endless when you start talking hooks....and then you want to modify said hooks....oh my.....maybe you should start a hook chart of all those sizes and kinds available and then show all the modifications one could make with said hooks to custom improve them even more....  Please make sure you list them all here when your done....  Willy Wob
662522,Skipper D,2012-02-01 18:13:00,1970,"So then whats the common hook size's  that you should keep in a tackle box ? I know there well be many but which ones , i am sure most guy have'nt every one ."
662532,mercman,2012-02-01 18:25:00,7054,Depends what you are fishing for. i carry 3/0 and 2/0 in my box.

662536,Skipper D,2012-02-01 18:34:00,1970,"  Thanks Paul , wish i had a picture to show every one"
662537,irishfield,2012-02-01 18:34:00,26272,"Might wanna rethink the small hook... small fish idea Skip. Sure if you don't want small fish try a huge hook.. and even that doesn't work with greedy pike and pickeral smashing musky baits. But thinking a small hook won't get you a big fish.. well this was caught on a 1/16th ounce jig with a hook opening of less than a 1/4"" !  "

662598,Skipper D,2012-02-01 21:48:00,1970," Awsome , so maybe i should rest my case right here ."
662602,mercman,2012-02-01 21:55:00,7054,Meilleur idee de la journee mon ami  
662609,Skipper D,2012-02-01 22:17:00,1970,I'd say we're off to not a bad  start with this .
662611,solopaddler,2012-02-01 22:24:00,8605,You're a good man Skipper. Welcome in my boat anytime.
662613,Skipper D,2012-02-01 22:34:00,1970,I'd go fish with any one on this site as long as i had the time .....lol .
662626,mercman,2012-02-01 23:27:00,7054,"Baitcaster or spinning reel.Its your time to shine Ron. Newbies are shy sometimes. I remember when i was only 3 months on here, and people were talking about worm blowers. I had no idea what the heck that was, and i thought they were joking around.I jumped in with a comment, and immediately wish i hadnt.Got spanked pretty bad by a few I had to google it to find out what it was.  So, maybe a simplistic ""how to"" post is a good thing.A place where newbies can feel free to ask silly questions, without sounding silly."
662632,Rod Caster,2012-02-01 23:32:00,5784,"Go fishing more often and fish with people willing to teach! Its the difference between learning from a book and learning hands-on. Judging by some of your amazing handy work, I'd say your a hands-on learner!"

662785,Big Cliff,2012-02-02 10:36:00,6899,"Funny, I use to be able to carry all the tackle I needed for a days fishing in a little box in my pocket. Over the years, it got to be that three tackle boxes weren't enough and if I didn't have at least six rods at my ready, something was wrong. Funny thing is, I think I caught more fish back when I just carried the tackle in my pocket LOL.  The last few years I have started winding it back down and going back to basics. I still have just as much fun, seem to catch as many if not more fish, and spend a lot less!  Hooks? A package small, medium, and large, if that doesn't work oh well! LOL"
662790,Skipper D,2012-02-02 11:29:00,1970,Thanks BC and thats kinda the way i feel too .
