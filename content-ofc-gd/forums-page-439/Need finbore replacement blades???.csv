Pretty good price imo.  http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/ice-fishing/augers-tools/fin-bore-accessories/prod109559.html  I also picked up a 6'6"" spinning Berkley Lighting rod for around $30. This will be my ""spare"" for next season. I'm still in the market for a fenwick HMG, St-Croix or similar quality spinning rod. I'm open to used offers as well  Time to hit winterlude with attidude... if you see anybody racing down the Canal bodychecking the slower people, come say hello."
