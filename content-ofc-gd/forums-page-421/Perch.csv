The fillets have the skin on, I have always cooked them without skin because that is the way I fillet them.  Do I need to skin them or can I cook them with the skin on and is the skin usually eaten?  thanks, Dan"
684858,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 20:22:00,2234,"Leave the skin on and fry or deep fry with your favorite batter. Leaving the skin on causes the fillet to curl, giving it a different look. Most restaurants leave the skin on. You won't notice the skin when cooked. The only reason we take the skin off is because scaling. Wish I had a scaler like they have at the processing plant. In Dover and other places, they use old potato pealing machines."
684871,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 20:45:00,2234,A recipe that is worth a try is dip the fillet in flour then in a egg-milk wash then in Kellogg corn flake crumbs then fry in oil. they end up nice and crispy crunchy. Gezz I'm making myself hungry

685038,Fish Farmer,2012-04-09 13:03:00,2234,"  Glad you like it Dan. I do that recipe when I do a small patch. I also use Italian bread crumbs instead of the cornflake, but the oil gets black after a few batches because of the cheese in the bread crumbs. But if it's for just a couple people it's OK."
