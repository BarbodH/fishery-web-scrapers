684442,John Bacon,2012-04-07 00:46:00,3277,Does any one if there is an available launch ramp on the west side of Frenchman's Bay? I know I can launch on the east side of the bay.  I wasn't too impressed with the ramp on the east side. I was ice fishing the bay this winter and it looked like Swans Marina on the west side of the bay had a good ramp. But I cannot find any information about launching boats from the west side.  Is Whitby harbour the next available launch east of Frenchman's Bay?  I would appreciate any information that you can provide.
684444,captpierre,2012-04-07 00:55:00,2521,"Yes, I believe Whitby is the next launch east.  You can launch off the beach just west of the gap out to the lake, into Frenchmans Bay.  If you have a heavy boat, you'd better have a 4x4.   Shallow launch -might have to put rear wheels into the water.  Not sure of the road but it's easy to find."
