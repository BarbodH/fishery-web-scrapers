684537,Terry,2012-04-07 13:51:00,14456," yeah, I saw that after the fact....still it seems to be the earth friendly way to do it..."
684543,Rod Caster,2012-04-07 14:01:00,5784,"Ah they just continue to use the oceans as a crapper. How is a boat with that much fuel just abandoned? Who the hell owns it, what is their insurance policy and make them pay for some of the salvage. An empty ship, sure, let 'er sink, but that's a lot of fuel to just dissipate. I think people often mistake the word dissipate with disapear. It doesn't just go away for christ sake. We pay crazy taxes and levies to cover ""green"" projects and make an effort to enviro friendly, and then in one fell swoop, 300,000 litres of fuel are sent to the air. We are talking out of two holes here. Its a joke and makes me completely hate solar power projects and other apparently meaningless green projects. Let's all evaporate a gallon of gas today... What difference does it make? Oh ya, you'd get fined! But a giant flippin tanker.. Target practice. Christ!"
684549,Terry,2012-04-07 14:24:00,14456,yeah  well as long as they don't start dumping their garbage in the ocean we should be fine
684725,Jer,2012-04-08 12:52:00,1426,"  Didja even read the story?  The ship wasn't abandoned...it was swept out to sea during last year's Japanese tsunami. I think they had more important things to worry about at the time...like thousands missing and killed, nuclear meltdown, total distruction...  The ship hade the capacity to carry 2000 gallons of fuel (nobody knows how much was actually aboard)...Where do you get the 300,000 litres from? It was a fishing trawler, not an oil tanker.  Most of us probably do evaporate (read burn) at least a gallon of fuel a day. We don't get fined, just taxed up the wazoo on it.  But you're right about Dalton's ""Green Energy"" plan, totally meaningless except for driving up hydro rates."

684768,Woodsman,2012-04-08 15:02:00,1286," What does this have to do with an outdated, worn out fishing trawler scheduled for scraping that was washed out to sea during a tsunami. The ships you referred to are in far better shape & mothballed."
684820,OhioFisherman,2012-04-08 18:11:00,6623,"Actually a lot of those ship will be cut up for scrap iron, LOL just as soon a China needs it! There are also a lot of old commercial ships sitting around, it is more cost effective to run the newer ones.  They had a program on TV here about some of the expense involved with our Military gear. The US military spends more fighting corrosion on their gear than the entire military budget of Canada.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suisun_Bay_Reserve_Fleet  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Reserve_Fleet  They have to remove hazardous materials from our ships before they are scrapped, I guess it is still ok to sink other peoples."
684844,Woodsman,2012-04-08 19:34:00,1286,Then you'd have no problem if the US spent their taxpayers money cleaning up & scraping that ship.

685017,lew,2012-04-09 11:04:00,12766,"To me personally, I always find it kinda sad to see a good ship sunk or scrapped, specially if it's one I've had a connection with.  HMCS Annapolis was built back in the early 60's and I had the pleasure of serving aboard her in 1966. She was a very high tech ship back in the day and spent over 30 years in service.  Alot of ships from different countries are completely cleaned of all hazardous materials and sunk to become artificial reefs for both fish and skuba divers. Several old Canadian ships have already been sunk and Annapolis is still waiting her turn.  This is Annapolis back in all her glory.      And sadly this is how she looks today, totally stripped down and  waiting to be sunk.      Another beautiful ship from the early 60's that served Canada well for many years was HMCS Provider. She was a tanker that supplied fuel to the fleet while  at sea and I served aboard her in 1964.      This is Provider fueling a pair of destroyers at sea.    And another of her fueling an aircraft carrier    When her years of service were completed she was sadly sold to a scrap dealer in Turkey but was at least given a good send-off when she left harbour for the last time behind an ocean going tug.      And here she is in Turkey just before the torches were put to her.  "

Could it not be towed to shore and disposed of correctly?   http://news.sympatico.cbc.ca/home/canadian_vessel_claims_salvage_rights_to_japanese_ghost_ship/3e662396"
684112,Rod Caster,2012-04-06 00:11:00,5784,I heard a report on the cbc that they were going to blow it up and allow the fuel to evaporate! I couldn't believe it

684182,bigugli,2012-04-06 02:37:00,6138,"Using a few shells in target practice will sink it, but slowly.  Certainly cheaper than guided missiles at a cost $250000 or more a piece. Of course, the USCG does not have access to that type of armament, just a bow mounted light gun"
684185,Christopheraaron,2012-04-06 02:42:00,3525,"I heard about that this morning, have the japanese said anything about it?"
684186,bigugli,2012-04-06 02:46:00,6138,"Why? Under international maritime law a derelict ship is free to whoever wants to take it under right of salvage. Further, under maritime law any derelict considered a potential hazard to navigation may be sunk or destroyed as deemed necessary. These are long accepted conventions."
684210,Pigeontroller,2012-04-06 03:57:00,2793,"I had the same thought, bad for the Ocean...But consider how much oil and fuel when into the worlds oceans between 1939 and 1945..."

684321,tb4me,2012-04-06 15:22:00,3295,"I agree, not that im a military professional, but it makes sence. What I dont get is, if they are out there doing target practice why not tow it back hoist it out of the water and scrap it out for scrap metal? Those diesel engines alone have to be worth a good penny. Why sink it like the ocean is a bloddy garbage basket. I dont get it at all..Couldnt somone get on board and start the beast and drive it to land? Did anyone actually try?"
684323,Terry,2012-04-06 15:27:00,14456,yeah but why build big guns if you don't get to use them....   I find it stupid for them to sink it and after a company says they will salvage it .... ah the military might
684369,uglyfish,2012-04-06 18:01:00,981,"because the cost to go out and get it and tow it back in an try to salvage anything off it, would be far more costly then shooting it.  not to mention, its been beat upon by mother nature and saltwater, which we all know is not good for steel. plus there is also the cost of disposing of the fuels one back on land, and the added cost of storage of the vessel and crew to actually strip it down and scrap it, which would take several weeks."
684376,Terry,2012-04-06 18:10:00,14456,"i think you are looking at it the wrong way  the company that claimed salvage rights goes and gets it at their own cost and they employ people to tear it apart and recycle the metal, and that is a win win situation no heavy oil spreading all over the ocean no rotting shell sitting at the bottom of the ocean  I see no down side to them towing it back for salvage"
684380,aplumma,2012-04-06 18:22:00,6896,The boat was slated for salvage in China before being washed out to sea.  The Coast Guard is not a free enterprise company that looks at the profit or lack of profit for a mission they are there to remove the hazard. If the company that claimed salvage had salvaged it it would be a moot point but after finding they either didn't have the equipment or the profit to do the job they left it. So why wait to sink it as it gets closer to shore ?The impact of the fuel and other hazards out to sea are a lot less than if we wait till it gets closer to the coastline. The Coast Guard discharges very few weapons however they save many people and protect the coastlines.   Art
684385,Steve,2012-04-06 18:34:00,2075,It is very interesting to see how differently americans and Canadians look at the same situation.

684398,aplumma,2012-04-06 19:45:00,6896,"It isn't a Nations line of thought or a us VS them train of thought. It is a matter of what does the most harm or presents the greatest hazard. Any nations ship could be damaged by a ghost vessel and the longer it is there the greater chance of collision. Just because a vessel claimed it, does not guareentee it has the finances or the ability to bring it into salvage in a timely manner.If  the vessel claims salvage rights and takes 1 month to get organized and in that time frame it drifts to shore or worse is in an accident is the company who claims salvage responsible? Taking action against a hazard in a timely manner is in the best interest of all of the ships that use that area.   Art"
684435,bigugli,2012-04-07 00:21:00,6138,"Maybe you should ask some people who actually know something about the subject. Someone with a coastguard or navy background. Maybe someone from TC. The rules are simple, A salvager takes it under control before it hits territorial waters or you sink it as an hazard to navigation before it can interfere with the coastal shipping lanes. Can't teach a lubber nuthin!"
684532,Jer,2012-04-07 13:07:00,1426,"  How is this an American vs Canadian thing? I'm Canadian, and I think if the US Coast Guard deems sinking the vessel the best approach...have at her!  The boat had already been claimed for salvage, but for what ever reason (probably cause they figgered it wasn't worth the money or the risk) they didn't follow up on their claim and tow it to shore.  I imagine that towing a vessel of that size and unknown structural integrity has to come with some risk to life and limb. It's a rusty old hulk afterall.  As someone already mentioned, when you consider the ships and planes that were sunk in the world's oceans during WWII, and the oceans survived believe it or not, one little fishing boat in 2012 is hardly significant. How many should risk their lives to bring it in, or should we wait for it to break up in a storm?"
684533,LeXXington,2012-04-07 13:22:00,1928,"The ship was originally slated to be decommissioned in Japan the owner gave up all rights to the boat.  Prior to sinking the vessel a fishing boat tried to tow it in under salvage rights.  Unable to tow the fishing boat  it was in the best interest to sink the boat.  1. Better to sink in far of shore where most of the fuel will dissipate 2. It was a hazard to navigation no lights, no driver and going into a high traffice area. 3. Towing it in would cost lots of tax dollars then you still have to pay for the disposal of the ship  Using it for target practice was just for fun, we really should have sent our navy they need the practice.  Ships sink every day all over the world, this one should have sunk in Japan but it wanted it see Canada first"
684535,Woodsman,2012-04-07 13:30:00,1286," Only one down side to it Terry. MONEY The Canadian fisherman that claimed the salvage rights on inspection relinquished them do to the condition of the ship which would not allow him to make a profit. He estimated it cost him $10,000 in fuel just to take his boat out to check the vessel. I seen him interviewed on TV."
