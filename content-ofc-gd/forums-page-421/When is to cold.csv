684506,davey buoy,2012-04-07 09:32:00,5505,Thought it might be time to get the boat ready.How cold would it have to get for your inboard/outboard motor to freeze and crack if left on a trailer outside? Thanks. I'm noticing our night time lows aren't getting below -2 or 3 degrees.
684514,fish_fishburn,2012-04-07 10:51:00,1311,It should not freeze if you make sure all the water has drained out of it after use. Keep it in the lowered position to drain and you should be fine.
684530,skeeter99,2012-04-07 12:27:00,109,  incorrect  the inboard/outbaords needs to be drained from the engine block   Lowering it to drain will not get all the water out of the engine block(disaster waiting to happen)  IMO the temps they are calling for in your area I would not worry much if it was sustained cold yes overnight not so much
684539,Sinker,2012-04-07 13:53:00,8692,"Yep, it would have to be cold enough for long enough to freeze it solid for anything to crack, and I doubt with these temps there is any ice at all inside the block. Its only below zero for a few hours over night, not long enough to freeze a block and crack it!  S."
