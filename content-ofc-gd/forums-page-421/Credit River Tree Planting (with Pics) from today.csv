684439,john from craa,2012-04-07 00:42:00,39,"Thanks to the more than 35 volunteers that came out to help today!  With so many volunteers we finsihed everything on the list and more!  We dug up about 1,500 trees from the CRAA nursery ranging from 3 to 20 feet tall from our growing beds.  Smaller trees were potted in 5-20 gallon pots.  About 1,000 of the largest trees were planted along the river including spruce, pine, fir, tamarack, cedar, poplar and maple.  Over 1,000 m of open river bank was planted.  Another 800 trees were potted for future work and another 1,000 smaller trees from the nursery were planted in beds for the 2014-15 seasons.  Projects like this go a long way to repairing damage done to the river over the past 200 years and help create the best salmon and trout fishing the river has seen.  In a few years shade will keep the water cooler, reduce erosion and improve trout, salmon and dozens of other species.  Here is a link to some before and after photos of past CRAA planting sites over the past 15 years.  http://www.craa.on.ca/fishing_beforeandafter.shtml  Many hands make light work.  I hope to see a lot more of you out there next time!  John  Peter with some big poplars in the 20 gallon pots.   Remo, Terri, Peter, Paul and Alissia planting small trees into the beds.   Trinity with a 6 foot white spruce.   Mike with a 20 foot poplar ready for the river bank!   Volunteers planting open field along the river.   Instant forest by CRAA!  Shade for years to come!   More trees for the river.  That huge silver maple beside my truck was planted by CRAA in 2003 as a 3"" caliper, 15 feet tall.  Now is 12"" caliper and 40 feet tall.   Make sure you don't miss the next event!  We saw some sweet water, saw some nice fish and had a great time.  John"
