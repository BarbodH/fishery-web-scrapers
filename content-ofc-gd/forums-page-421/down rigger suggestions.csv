684189,muskymatt,2012-04-06 02:51:00,2608,"My old cannons are kaput, I'm in the market for some new ones. I rarely fish deeper than 150'. Any suggestions?"
684191,irishfield,2012-04-06 02:53:00,26272,Kaput... are they past the trade deadline!  What's wrong with them? Probably cheaper for a refurb than new...
684196,muskymatt,2012-04-06 03:00:00,2608,"They are probably late 70's, early 80's models. Casings are cracking from age and the gears jump while retrieving. I'd be surprised if parts were even available"
684197,Kingsalmon,2012-04-06 03:10:00,107, Cannon bodies are guaranteed for life.  MAy be beneficial to call the service centre in North Bay and see if you can upgrade in lieu of repair.  It may be worth a try!
684199,irishfield,2012-04-06 03:15:00,26272,Yep.. call.. ask for George and you might be surprised!
684241,captpierre,2012-04-06 12:07:00,2521,"I've had good luck with my Scotties.  Fast, reliable, Canadian made."
684257,muskymatt,2012-04-06 13:08:00,2608,"I'll do that, thanks for the advice."

684624,dwc67,2012-04-07 20:13:00,140,take out  a loan a go with traxstech.  
684677,rhare,2012-04-08 01:36:00,387,"Why go traxtech?  The scotty riggers are still faster on pick up and drop,require much less battery power, parts are much easier to get, lifetime warranty, 100% made in canada for the last 60 years. $300 less per rigger, simple almost fail proof design and most important they are proven to be workhorses."
684717,RSF,2012-04-08 12:09:00,47,"Getting parts for the older cannons may be fun..If your having problems finding cannon parts, you might check out cannon parts at Fish307. I have ordered all sorts of cannon parts from them..good prices and fast.  Found the cheapest way to bring in the stuff from the USA is USPS/Canada Post. Under hundred they don't charge for Brokerage, just a flat fee of eight dollars and tax. Freight's cheaper than overnight methods too."
685048,silveradosheriff,2012-04-09 13:46:00,1025,"Canons, Scottys and Big Jons all make great products. If you can, get out on some boats and try them out. I am happy with my BJ Pro Tourneys and also like my buddies 1116s."
