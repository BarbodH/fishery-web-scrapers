684938,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-09 00:24:00,10439,Mike Just pick up one of THESE and you'll be good to go.
684953,solopaddler,2012-04-09 01:11:00,8605," Thanks buddy! Before your next fishing trip check this out, it'll help a lot!  http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/fishing-for-dummies-cheat-sheet0.html"
684956,kickingfrog,2012-04-09 01:14:00,8333, But do they float?
684958,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-09 01:24:00,10439,  Who cares they're only 40 bucks!!!    :rofl2:
684971,HTHM,2012-04-09 02:09:00,4082,"   Here is a story,possibly fiction and possibly fact:  One day two men and a boy went fishing together and were having a wonderful time, no fish were to be seen, except for some that decided to flip their middle fin at the trio. One of the trio is a well respected outdoors-man and fisherman. The other two members of the trio can be described as wanting and willing to learn from the master. truth be told, one of the members has the advantage of many more years of training  ahead of him, the last member of the trio, well he can be described as having more horsepower than brains. This horsepower comes into play as a possible explanation of the loss of the camera. The theory being put forward can be explained by physics. When  air travels over a surface that has a protuberance it will create what is called uplift, and the greater the wind speed, the greater the lift. One of these individuals that makes up the trio, deals with this issue in his daily work designing assemblies that are placed on the rooftops of buildings. He should have know better that to create the amount of lift required to vacuum a relatively lightweight piece of equipment off the deck of a boat. The key wind speed  in this case happened to be 47 MPH - coincidently the speed of the boat over the water at the time of the alleged incident. This is merely one theory that is being postulated as an explanation for the loss of the said camera. So OFC fact or fiction????"
684984,solopaddler,2012-04-09 02:57:00,8605,"That's a very well written tale my friend, full of wonderful descriptive words and fantastic imagery.  The condensed version is this: Someone gunned the throttle to show off and my camera flew out of the boat.   "
684987,Dutchy,2012-04-09 03:07:00,416,"Currently Canon I would say have the best technology. I run a research group and we have some very high end cameras ($10K cost) and canons just dump on the other brands for quality of image. Sony's cybershot was good, but because they had Carl Zeiss lenses (Zeiss manufacture microscopes so lenses are their business). They lost that deal with Zeiss and the cameras are now crap. They bumped up the pixel level to compensate, but the new cybershots suck.  You cannot go wrong with any Canon quite frankly, but for the price, the PowerShot ELPH 300 HS is a great camera. The photos are awesome, and I use the camera to tape concerts and the videos are excellent. It also has better sound capability which may not be a dealbreaker for you. It also has optical and digital zoom, tons of presets for different conditions, and it nice and compact."
685028,Paulus,2012-04-09 12:44:00,522,"One thing to consider - which I learned by accident this fall - is that cameras with an automatic lens cap (like the Canon SX series) can have issues if the slightest grain of sand or dirt gets into the mechanism that opens up the lens cap. There are ways of fixing it of course, but none of the methods apply in the field.  I had real issues with this last fall, when a fish kicked up some sand into the lens of my Canon SX120, and despite my best efforts at cleaning the actual cap, it still sticks and I always have to make sure that it doesn't mess up the edges of my shots.  Most of the waterproof cams won't have this issue - but most of the pocket super zooms will. So, if you get one - they're great, but very delicate.  Another option is to go old school... you can find old, working condition cameras on Kijiji and Ebay for prices that make accidents less painful.  I recently revived and refitted my old Minolta Z1, which still has one of the better CCD's imo - although it's only got 3.2 megapixels. You once referred to this camera as a ""beast"" - but I have no fear for this camera falling in the water.  p.-"
685070,John,2012-04-09 14:22:00,2956,Mike I would not go past Canon on Panasonic. Had Sony too but never has as good results. I am currently using a Panasonic Lumix DMC and it probably the best picture (for a dummy like me) that I have seen.  Check out comparisons here   www.dpreview.com  John
685076,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-09 14:42:00,10439,  Thanks Mike. Will you lend me your copy?
685082,solopaddler,2012-04-09 15:05:00,8605,  Trying to think of a comeback....I got nuthin'.   
685102,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-09 15:51:00,2690,"I'm chiming in a little late on this one, but, I love my little Nikon p & s...less than $120, and, takes great shots.  Pretty much any of the shots of Juli in my reports are taken with it...she uses the much more expensive Canon SLR for hers."
684596,solopaddler,2012-04-07 18:46:00,8605,"My good digital is now on the bottom of the Grand River in Dunnville (don't ask  )  Been researching cameras today as I need another one asap.  Can anyone recommend one in particular and if so why?  After some brief research the Canon S100 looks pretty good, does anyone have this one?"
684600,Dabluz,2012-04-07 19:01:00,701,"I have an Olympus.  The picture quality is disappointing.  Also, lots of pictures are yellowish.  Another thing, my camera uses XD cards which are harder to find and are more expensive.  However, the camera is well protected from the elements and takes quite a bit of abuse.  My daughter was given a Canon and even though it is an expensive model, the picture quality is great."
684603,woodenboater,2012-04-07 19:11:00,2277,Sorry to hear about your donation to the Grand River  My next point and shoot may be this. not cheap but would rock for fishing or canoe trips.  http://bit.ly/oFJABK
684604,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-07 19:11:00,10439,Mike The Canon Powershot D10 is supposed to be a good all weather camera as are the Panasonic Lumix TS series.  You already know about the Olympus Stylus series (they sink!!!)  LOL    :rofl2:
684605,Twocoda,2012-04-07 19:12:00,4130,Mike when i had to replace mine i took the advice of Ryan (Urban Fisherman) and bought one of the Fugi water proof cameras....its been a year and a half of total abuse on the camera and keeps on working   it has video functions and take pretty darn good shots @ 10MP ....the only complaint i have with it is its a bit too compact for getting the SD card and battery in and out of....but still a great buy for the money...i paid 200 but i think they have dropped in price to a buck fifty or so .....so it wont break the bank if you have the inevitable happen again...  would i buy this camera again? (glad you asked) i think so but i havent seen whats out there now as a durable cheap fishing camera that takes pretty good pics  edit to add ...i also have a floating strap attached to it ...so its just a matter of turning the boat around and picking up the camera
684608,solopaddler,2012-04-07 19:27:00,8605,"Thanks guys. I'm not really interested in waterproof or shockproof this time. My main criteria is compactness and quality of picture and video.  Dave I still have the Olympus, that's my daughters camera now. It was my new camera that went for a swim.  Was never impressed with the Olympus beyond its ruggedness."
684611,misfish,2012-04-07 19:31:00,29133,"  Im asking.It,s got to be a great story Mike.   I,m still using my FE-20 Olympus for my fishing/hunting trips.If it went to the bottom of the river,I would find something that was more water friendly."
684612,Old Man,2012-04-07 19:37:00,822, Love the Canon D10. Good all around mid price point & shoot.
684613,captpierre,2012-04-07 19:37:00,2521,Canon's tough to beat.  Decide whether you want a viewfinder or not.  Having one helps in bright light or if you want to makesure you capture a facial expression.  If not you get a larger viewfinder.  Make sure you can force it to flash.  For fish pictures you usually want the flash -especially if your subject is wearing a hat and his face is in the shade.  Get one that shoots HD video.
684614,woodenboater,2012-04-07 19:37:00,2277,What I currently use is a Panasonic LX3. Reason are: compact; wide angle lens (24mm equivalent and main reason I got the camera); does 16:9 video (720p HD). Newer model is LX5 and is wide angle as well but longer on the tele end.
684615,Dondorfish,2012-04-07 19:38:00,1000,I think my next camera will be the GoPro - heard some great things about it:  http://gopro.com/?utm_adcj=10902984&utm_source=cj&utm_affiliatecj=5636949
684632,gordy28,2012-04-07 21:22:00,638,I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC TS3 It's awesome for fishing-easy to use and best of all it's a rugged camera Which means it's; Shockproof from a drop of up to 3 metres Waterproof up to 40 feet Takes underwater pictures Has a gps in it- gps can be off or on.  When onitwill tell you the exact coordinates of every picture which is great for when you forget to use a waypoint in the excitement Got it as a Christmas gift but believe they are available between 275-300 dollars
684676,I'mHooked,2012-04-08 01:25:00,525," Oh there's a good story...on the camera itself! Let's just say that there is no longer any ""evidence"" of some catches my wife wouldn't otherwise believe me about.  At least I know what was on it! (and Mike can sign an affidavit verifying it!  )"
684685,Aaron Shirley,2012-04-08 02:44:00,655,"Mike, if you can afford this Canon, it will be worth the money. I know someone that got it and absolutely loves it. Great reviews on it as well. It has a wide angle lens and 14x optical zoom. 12mp and HD video. Impressive specs. It may be my next compact camera. There is a waterproof case specific for this camera that you can get later if you want as well for diving or taking your new camera for a swim on the Grand...  This camera should give you the quality that you are looking for with photos and video.  Canon SX230"
684694,fishnsled,2012-04-08 03:51:00,3520,"I'm loving my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3. Fits nicely in the pocket, waterproof for when it's raining or that underwater shot. I also got the optional floating strap.....just in case."
684701,Moosebunk,2012-04-08 05:23:00,3970,"  That happens all the time to river rats like us.  I've always liked my Lumix's... but what I like more though, is the old Jasc Paintshop program that goes along with the finishing.  What about a little Nikon Mike?  I haven't heard much about them as few people seem to buy them... but man, it's Nikon..?"
684704,Jet,2012-04-08 05:38:00,364,I'll second the TS3. I have the TS2 and the TS3 is a great evolution. New GPS feature makes it great for fishing.  You said picture quality and video are important and it does both amazingly. HD video is probably it's strongest feature against direct competition and picture quality is top notch. I use it for my business all the time. My website pics were taken with it and I am by no means a photographer.  TS3 Test Detailed review here.  So the water and shock protection would be an added bonus that I'm sure you'll find some use for  But that said non-weather Panasonics are cheaper with same creative quality.
684714,solopaddler,2012-04-08 11:46:00,8605,"Outstanding input guys, thanks!"
684716,BillM,2012-04-08 12:05:00,17367,"Mike, I forgot to mention in my email that I've also got a Panasonic TS3 for those wet/rainy days where I don't wanna bring out my 60D.  It's a good little camera, but I'm not a fan of the user menu at all..   If this is purely for a fishing camera, it's tough to beat the rugged package that the TS3 comes in..  If you're looking for an all around camera, there are better ones out there.   I usually suggest the best Canon SD series a person can afford   If you want a little more zoom out of a compact camera, the SX series that Aaron suggested deserves a look.  Bought my mom a SX200 for her birthday last year, takes some great pics with lots and lots of range."
684880,MJL,2012-04-08 21:02:00,2427,"And to add to the confusion even more, you should also check out the Olympus XZ-1 if it's in your budget. Video quality doesn't seem so great (compared to the Canon S95 which I used) but the photos I took with the one I borrowed were superb - Sharpness was excellent and colour seemed accurate. Lens apperture goes down to F/1.8 and it does an OK job in lower light conditions (eg. indoors) - Still not comparable to DSLR quality in low light but you shouldn't expect it to be considering the sensor is a fraction of the size.  I'm also in the market for a compact point and shoot for underwater work when I'm ice fishing...DSLR + underwater housing doesn't fit into the hole.LOL"
684910,Dutchy,2012-04-08 22:53:00,416,"Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS is the best by far in its price range. I have this, quality of videos and photos is superb."

Thanks Mike, but I doubt I'll buy another Olympus product again.    From what I've seen I tend to agree, but I have no yardstick to measure what I'm seeing against.  I'm not a camera guy so have no clue how the Canons stack up against other makes."
684929,SirCranksalot,2012-04-08 23:44:00,3291,"I have a Canon SX20(20 times zoom that I like for children and other wildlife, esp when canoeing). I have had it for a couple of years-(ever since mine found the bottom of the Mad River---you can ask if you like but I'll never tell ) and love it. It has most of the features of a SLR and Canon is noted for its quality glass ."
684931,Joeytier,2012-04-08 23:50:00,3990,"I got a Fujifilm 14 megapixel point and shoot last December.  It takes excellent quality HD video, but I must admit that my 3/4 year old Nikon Coolpix 8 megapixel takes better quality photos, and had far more options."
