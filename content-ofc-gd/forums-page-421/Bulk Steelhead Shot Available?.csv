684619,J-M,2012-04-07 19:56:00,65,"Hey guys, I find I'm always running out of small BB split shot for steelhead. Just wondering if any of the steelheaders on this board have found a supplier that offers larger quantities of shot? I'm talking large quantities that will last me more than a season or two.   Thanks guys   JM"
684623,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-07 20:08:00,10439,I just buy up a bunch of Water Gremlin (without the wings) from LeBarons when ever I start to run low.
684625,solopaddler,2012-04-07 20:18:00,8605,"Exactly, the so called ""steelhead"" shot is a waste of money. Not only is it more expensive, bit it's harder.  If you find yourself sliding the shot around on your line to adjust your shot pattern as I do, that stuff will bruise your line.  Round Gremlin shot is super soft, is easy on your line, and best of all it's cheap. It's all you need.  The only downside if there is any is it's bright and shiny.  To remedy that you can turn it jet black by bathing it in Liquid Drano for an hour or so.  I always do it, although it's probably just a confidence thing with me. I know Drifter doesn't treat his and he catches fish. Still, it's quick and easy to do so why not?"

684628,MJL,2012-04-07 20:41:00,2427, Was it because you saw me land double digit numbers of 20+lb steelhead today using split shots brought to you by the Water Gremlin Company â€“ For all your split shot needs?
684637,misfish,2012-04-07 21:34:00,29133,"  Ya,,,,,,,,,,,,,THATS IT."
684641,davey buoy,2012-04-07 21:59:00,5505," I didn't see you ,but I.m sold now lol."
684668,misfish,2012-04-08 00:25:00,29133,  You mean like this one?  
684669,misfish,2012-04-08 00:27:00,29133,  You mean like this one?  
684869,J-M,2012-04-08 20:41:00,65,"Does water gremlin have weights in smaller sizes though? Or are you guys using larger shot? I don't mind using larger shot for larger river systems, but for smaller creeks, I like the small BB's..."
684870,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-08 20:44:00,3761,Makes me wonder how much lead and hook is on the bottom of the creeks haha
684872,MJL,2012-04-08 20:46:00,2427," My box is stocked with B & BB sized water gremlin shots. According to the chart below, they are equivalent to AB & #1 shots. If I ever need to go smaller, I use Sure Shot in #4 but I can't remember the last time I've had to.  http://www.questoutdoors.net/gear/articles/shot-size-conversion/"
684875,davey buoy,2012-04-08 20:54:00,5505," How much for how many?,if you can remember. I can go by LeBarons any time while I'm in the city.Thanks."
684886,dnb_cbr,2012-04-08 21:21:00,61,"south bend non removable are a good alternative as well.  They are already fairly dark, and if you dont crimp them on too tight, they slide around fine on your shot/main lines.  forgot to add, they are available at walmart"
684890,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-08 21:34:00,10439," They come in B, BB, 3/0, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2 (smallest to largest)."
684899,misfish,2012-04-08 22:21:00,29133,  Spoken like a true P3TA.
684902,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-08 22:32:00,10439,  $1.88 pkg #'s differ by size.
684903,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-08 22:33:00,10439,  No need to worry Mike the Loons and Ducks vaccume them all up.
684911,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-08 22:56:00,3761, Had to throw it in
