684947,alexw,2012-04-09 01:02:00,74,"Hi everyone,  I caught a crappie this weekend with a tag on, and the tag has ""S.S.F.C"" and a number on it. Did a little bit googling, ""S.S.F.C"" stands for ""Sir Sandford Fleming College"". I understand that when a fish is caught with M.N.R tag, then I should report it to M.N.R. But, since this is a ""S.S.F.C"" tag, should I report it to ""S.S.F.C""?  Thanks,  Alex"

684954,Pikeslayer,2012-04-09 01:11:00,1443,I would think it would be the Lindsay campus you would want to contact.

684972,alexw,2012-04-09 02:12:00,74,Thanks for the replies. I will give S.S.F.C Lindsay campus a call this week.  Alex
