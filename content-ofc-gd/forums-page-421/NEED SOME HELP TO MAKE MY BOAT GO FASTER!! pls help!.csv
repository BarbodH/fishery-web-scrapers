684867,jedimaster,2012-04-08 20:40:00,3472,Are you ventilating at all? Losing water pressure? Chine walking? Are you even full up on the pad? Need a lot more details to help you out. The only thing about a jackplate on a smaller bass boat is the extra stress it places on the transom from the cantelever effect. Your transom may flex and have issues. Other than that the jack plate will give you a bit more stability and help you bridge waves a bit better.
684877,Jackie,2012-04-08 21:00:00,124,"It doesnt porpoise much, I can get out of water without issue, might be a bit slow, but not much porpoise. I think the bow didn't get lift up enough... I can see that while running at high speed, the water splash was right beside where we were sitting or maybe just abit behind. I guess supposedly the splash should be even further back near the transom area?"
684878,Jackie,2012-04-08 21:00:00,124,Oh and what do u mean by wedge the motor a bit?
684879,Jackie,2012-04-08 21:02:00,124,"I don't have a water pressure gauge on the boat, but I will soon put one on before I Play with the jack plate. But I think the cooling was running fine during the last outting, water flowing out was warm and coming out freely for the whole day"
684904,jedimaster,2012-04-08 22:34:00,3472,"Yep, get a water pressure gauge. When tuning a boat you want to run the motor as high as possible so that you don't lose water presure, and can still get out of the hole. Alot of guys will plug the upper water intake holes so they don't lose water presure.  This is because you will get less drag from the lower unit being in the water, As for wedging the motor, thats more if you need help getting out of the hole. But to wedge it you can just insert some washers between the jack plate and motor mounton the bolts. On the bottom if you need more bow lift, on the top if you need less. You can also buy wedges that do the same thing.  If you are porpoising when your running WOT (WIDE OPEN THROTTLE) then you have too much trim. You can basically run wide open, then trim up til it porpoises, then back it down a bit til it stops and tip up a bit more. Thats as high out of the water your can run.  Try and get the motor up high but DO NOT do it unless you have a water pressure guage. A water pressure gauge is manditory when using jack plates. I used to run a 12 inch jack plate on my 15 foot stratus and it made a huge difference in top speed stability.  If you have everything setup as well as you can and you still can't get to top rpms, you can try lowering the prop pitch by a degree. As was mentioned above you want your motor to max out rpm's so your motor isn't lugging. If you go too high in pitch you either won't get out of the water, or you don't have enough hp to push that much water.  There are some little things you can do like, getting a slightly smaller diameter prop, closing the prop vents(top end), adding vents(hole shot), move any weight as low as possible and as far back in the boat as possible. get a lighter trolling motor etc... there are alot of things you can do. It could be you have too much prop or just the wrong prop. Some boats run better with a lower pitch 4 or 5 blade. It depends if you need bow lift or transom lift. The cup a prop has can also make a difference."
684923,Jackie,2012-04-08 23:29:00,124,Woah! Thanks a bunch jedimaster for these useful info! I will sure get a water pressure gauge before I do anything else. Do u know if BPS sell them? And around how much should it be?
684925,Jackie,2012-04-08 23:33:00,124,Oh and what's the right psi for my motor to run in high speed? Or it varies between different settings?
684935,jedimaster,2012-04-09 00:12:00,3472,"It varies between motors, my friends evinrude, runs fine at like 6 psi. Best thing is to look up your motor specs. screamandfly is a great resource as is bassboatcentral.  Most guys plug the top hole at least and run the motor up high enough to just barely not lose water presure. I mean your not gonna break and speed records, but you should be able to get into the low 50's. The real serious guys get into streamlining there lower unit with a nose cone and a waterpickup a the bottom of the lower unit instead of on the top.  Losing weight, moving the weight to the back all helps with top end. Moving the oil tank to the back, gas tanks, batteries etc... thats all to squeeze out an extra mph here an extra 1/2 mph there. Just try and follow the basics of boat performance. I'll try and offer whatever info I can but I think I have pretty much exhausted my brain power. Oh yah, a big piece of advice when tweaking boats. Make one change at a time and test. What works on one boat may not work on another, if you make two changes you could get a 2 percent bonus with one and a 3 percent negative with the other and see a 1 percent loss but you actually could have gone up 2 percent."
684988,Jackie,2012-04-09 03:21:00,124,Haha yea that's a lot brain energy been used in providing these great info and advises. Really appreciate ur help! Thank you very much jedimaster! Now let's hope I can absorb all these info good enough to make everything work out soon!

Thanks for the advise guys!"
684698,Jackie,2012-04-08 04:26:00,124,"Waynechute, what's vent plugs? and what does it do?"
684728,aplumma,2012-04-08 13:10:00,6896,"I am not sure you are going in the right direction with a composite prop... The reason that a Stainless steel prop is better than an aluminum prop is it does not flex under load as easily. Going to a composite prop that is not as stiff even as aluminum will allow it to flex and it loses the cup and pitch to a certain extent. They are usually used on lower horsepower rated motors were they have less of a load on them. I have a 150 hp on a 1989 Ranger boat and their is roughly a 4 mph difference between my SS and my aluminum prop due to the lack of flexing of the SS prop since both props have the same diameter,cup and pitch. Personally your next step just might be to contact the company that makes the boat and get there input on what they feel is a good match up or visit a bass tournament in the area and see what they are using on the same set up. Checking with a few local marinas/repair places some have a loaner prop program where you get to try the prop for free to see which one is the right one to buy. Since performance is what you are looking for you will find that all of the go fast racing and bass master rigs all use Stainless Steel props not because they are shiny but because they are the correct answer.

684729,davey buoy,2012-04-08 13:13:00,5505, However Art more expensive and less forgiving than a aluminum prop when hitting a rock

684798,aplumma,2012-04-08 16:35:00,6896, You are correct the SS is more money and since it is ridgid it will break rather than bend. You got to pay to play when you are in the speed game.   When I am down here the waterways have less humps and shoals so the SS is great. When I come up North I change to the aluminum prop. because of the lay of the land and my lack of knowledge of the places I fish.   Art
684813,kickingfrog,2012-04-08 17:43:00,8333,I thought you got rid of the prop altogether? Man I can't keep you two straight.
684819,jedimaster,2012-04-08 18:07:00,3472,"Your numbers give that a prop slip of 20%, thats pretty high. The theoretical speed is 51mph for a 2.07 gear ratio, 22 pitch prop, and 5100 rpms.  If you are not able to trim up enough you can add a wedge on you motor/jackplate. If your boat isn't able to trim up enough that could help you to also increase your rpm's as you will be getting more of the boat out of the water.  With a 22 pitch prop, and 5500 rpms, your theoretical max speed is 55mph. I would think you should be able to get your prop slip down in the 10% range getting you around 50mph...  Just for some info high 50's with a 2.07 gear ratio and a 22 pitch prop, your motor would require around 6000 rpm's. The theoretical max speed at 6000 rpms is 60 mph, add in prop slip your gonna be into you high to mid 50's...  A boat CAN'T go faster than the theoretical max speed. You can't have negative slip. Its not possible. as in PERIOD. End of story. Unless you also have a jet engine pushing you. But at that point your prop would be slowing you down.  A prop is essentially a screw in the water. Given the angle of the screw (pitch) and the speed its spinning, it can only move through the water so fast. There is always some slip, caused by hull drag, wind resistance, water resistance on the prop, prop flex will also have an effect, losing you a few degrees f pitch with an alluminum prop at full speed etc... This is referred to as slip.  For an efficient hull, and setup in a bass boat your looking at around 10% slip. An souper duper Allison might down down into the 5% prop slip range under the right conditions. Anything better than 10 percent is great, less than that and you can usually do some work.  You at 20% prop slip right now so you have some work to do.  And btw do your speeed with a gps. Water based speedo's are crap at best."
684821,craigdritchie,2012-04-08 18:18:00,1586,"Okay, since no one else has, I'll bite.  To the OP ....... why do you need to go faster?  And, exactly how fast do you need to go?"
684824,jedimaster,2012-04-08 18:25:00,3472,Going faster means you can cruise slower using less fuel. An efficient boat is cash in your pocket. at 20 % slip he is throwing cash out the back of the boat even at cruising speeds.
684827,walleyemen,2012-04-08 18:35:00,316,"It,s not a matter of going faster as it is in having the motor running at its best, if Jackie can trim down and essentually loose no speed then its slipping, kinda like doing 60mph in your car at half throttle and punching it and gaining no speed or just even spinning your tires, lots going on but not going anywheres,if the motors workng to hard and not doing what it should or labouring to achive what it needs then your just killing the motor!"

684861,jedimaster,2012-04-08 20:30:00,3472,"There are lots of reasons for a jack plate.. Especially on a small boat. Every extra inch makes a difference. When you trim the motor fully do you porpoise at all? I think your going to need to wedge the motor a bit. This is pretty common. I had to do the same with my stratus. I am a little bit confused what the problem is though. Are you saying the bow isn't lifting up high enough, or it won't go down enough?  If you are under power and you are unable to trim the motor up up and raise the bow then you have a mechanical issue. I mean you motor should trim up right out of the water. If you have too much prop your likely to not even be able to get out of the water. How is it getting up on plane? I would raise the motor. Start with the prop shaft at 2 inches below the pad. When you drop to a 4 or 5 blade prop your doing this to get out of the hole faster not to raise your top end.  What pitch prop were your running on that high 5, what was your top speed and gear ratio?"
684501,Jackie,2012-04-07 06:14:00,124,"Hey guys,  I just bought a 1999 Ranger R61 with a 2004 115hp Opti. I installed a 5.5 inch jackplate and put on a 22"" Laser II SS prop. I went out today to test it, didn't get a good result. I can only get it up to 66kph/41mph at 5100 RPM...it won't go higher... Another weird thing is that I cannot trim the motor all the way up while running at high speed. I can only trim it half way as shown on the trim indicator on the dash, it just won't allow me...But I was able to trim the motor all the way up while idling. Just wondering what should I do...should I lower the jackplate or raise it up? and by how much? do I need to get another prop? and what size?  Thanks a bunch!"

684505,Gerry,2012-04-07 08:02:00,257,"Your RPMs at WOT should be 5500. Your prop is too big. You could try raising the jackplate but watch your water pressure. Don't fool with it if you don't have a water pressure guage. Also, a 115 can only deliver so much, I would expect to see no more than 45 mph. As you raise the jackplate you will get more slip which will counteract your quest for more speed. Hope this helps."
684516,fish_fishburn,2012-04-07 11:05:00,1311,Prop set up is a tricky thing. First you cannot lift your motor past high trim at wide open throttle. The motor has a built in safety feature that only allows you to use the trim phase only when the motor is running higher than about 2500 rpm. Get yourself a 21 pitch and try that before you start adjusting the motor height. Then go to bassboat .com and read the posts on prop setup. Lots of valuable info on there from some really knowledgable people. Not sure if a jack plate is going to help you much with a 115.
684518,ecmilley,2012-04-07 11:26:00,2163,"your close on prop, may have to drop it to a 21p i believe that anywhere from 5000-5500rpm wot your in the ball park, also remember Rangers are built heavy and stable takes a little more to get em going i.e my 363v 18ft ranger boat with a 150 runs 58mph so running 41 seems only iittle off. now where do you got the jackplate set? set the motor to 3.5 inches off the pad and work from there.

684522,solopaddler,2012-04-07 11:50:00,8605,"I'm certainly no expert, but my guess would be the jackplate needs to go.  In all probability it's impeding the motor which is why you can't fully trim at high speed as well.  I had a plate on my boat initially and kept fooling with different motor heights, props, trim levels, etc, and it never really ran properly no matter what I did.  Finally ditched it and installed trim tabs at the back. Honestly it was like night and day.  I found a marked increase in performance when I installed them. Both in the handling and smoothness of the ride, and in how quickly the boat went up on plane.  Even at low speed the boat goes on plane. Those tabs are amazing."
684527,skeeter99,2012-04-07 12:22:00,109,"  1. the jackplate is set to low (if it is manual raise until no blow out but decent out of hole shot) 2. I think it is a bit to much prop (especially for a ranger quite a heavy boat) 20 or 21 would be better 3. you cannot trim all the way up, (most bass boats you cannot and will blow out) if your jackplate is hydraulic drop it lower while you are running to achieve maximum/optimum trim angle   just for reference  I have a Skeeter ss90 with a merc 90hp 2 stroke , I run 51 to 53 mph depending on load/passengers  I am running a  20 pitch Lazer II prop  2 inches below pad(no Jackplate) at WOT 5100 to 5600 rpms depending on trim angle and load  but unfortunately it is a ranger (the best boat to fish out of in the world IMO) but they are not fast at all, that is why you see them with 250 hp and even 300 hp offshore engines on them and they cannot break that magical 70 mph, but other boats with a 200 hp can achieve 70 mph quite easily with the right setup"

684594,Terry,2012-04-07 18:09:00,14456,yeah I was in the boat when it did it...fast boat for a small motor
684601,Jackie,2012-04-07 19:09:00,124,"Thanks a bunch for these great infos guys! Really appreciated! I didnt have any problem getting the boat off plan. But really, im expecting more from this little boat with a 115 and a 5.5 jackplate on it! And yea i was getting a pretty high roostertail... But no speed... I will try lowering the jack plate by a bit and see what it will do first. Then I will try a different pitch prop. Apparently someone with a same boat same motor, same jack plate and same prop is doing 55mph... So there's gotta be something... Anyways thanks again guys !!  Jackie"

684629,Terry,2012-04-07 20:43:00,14456,"yeah but they said they tried different trim settings  he is not answering all the questions but from what I read into it the bow of thew boat is not getting out of the water enough only a small area at the back of the boat should be touching the water.....you should only see water pushing away from the boat at the back of the boat at the right trim setting as you lower the trim and the front of the boat comes down you see the water being pushed out at the side of the boat , trim down more and you see it going more and more forward..slowing the boat down with the drag from the water and I am thinking that is your problem  your jack plate needs adjusting and I think you need a prop that has more lift  a good marina will let you try out props till you get the right one at Top Gun Marina I bought a used SS prop and kept exchanging it till I got one that worked the best a high five was the ticket for me  I don't think you need a smaller pitch on the prop because you got up on plane easily.."
