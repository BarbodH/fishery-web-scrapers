Back in 2010 I bought a new 17' Sylvan Expedition with a 115 4-stroke which sadly doesn't get as much use as she deserves.  I'm a shift worker, so finding free time to fish has been tough as we have two young children.  This year, I'm hoping to change that though.  I keep my boat up on Scugog for the most part, and have found some great spots.  My wife is off for the year on maternity leave, so that may help.  I've read, Scugog gets a pretty bad rap as an overcrowded, tournament ridden fishery, however there are still many great fish to be had.  I live in Bowmanville, so it's great being able to leave the house, and be on the water within 35mins!  Anyways, if anyone sees a blue/white Sylvan out on the bog, be sure to say hi.  Jeremy"
