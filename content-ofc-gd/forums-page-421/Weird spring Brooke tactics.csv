684379,Freshtrax,2012-04-06 18:14:00,2215,Im headed into the woods for two days to chase bookies this weekend.  It's in a med size river with class 1-3 whitewater and a few big old logging dams along the way.  I know it holds some nice ones I've caught tons in the summer using basic brookietechniques any weird presentations out there you care to share? I'm open to anything new.
684389,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-06 18:54:00,0,"bring some steelhead floats, small shot, and early season fly patterns."
684396,Leecher,2012-04-06 19:34:00,7832,"For brookies, I always start with a simple setup... light line (mono my preferred type 6lbs   )  a size 4 hook and a dewie... cast out and let it fall naturally... if there's any trout in the vasinity you'll know real quick  Also keep your shadow from reflecting in the water... always have the sun in your face  Good luck and tight lines Leechman"
684410,northernpike56,2012-04-06 21:37:00,717,"4 lb fluorocarbon, small hook, small piece of a worm. no split shots or anything else. just drift it along and you'll get them. I also did really well on tiny spinners last year (panther martin #1, mepps #0)."
684418,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-06 22:37:00,310,Not sure if you consider this weird but I often have great success in the spring trolling SLOWLY with flies on a spinning rod. Black or Olive wooly buggers always do the trick.
684479,Freshtrax,2012-04-07 02:41:00,2215,Thanks guys.   Trip got shortened still getting one day in.   Canoe is on the roof. Rods freshly spooled. I'm stoked for the first real fishing trip of the year.
684633,Dabluz,2012-04-07 21:27:00,701,"Yep....most definitely go with the very light clear mono, size 6 Gamakatsu Octopus hook and the head of a large night crawler and nothing else.  If you do add a split shot, put it on at least 24 inches above the hook.  It's got to go deep and slow.  Panther Martins are my favourite brook trout lures.  They are the first things I use.  Small minnow imitations also work good but they also have to go deep so use sinking models."
