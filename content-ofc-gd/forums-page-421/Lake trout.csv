683957,Christopheraaron,2012-04-05 16:46:00,3525,Are they in the shallows yet?
683963,BillM,2012-04-05 16:53:00,17367,They've been in the shallows since ice out.
683966,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-05 16:56:00,0,only one way to find out.
683981,fishindevil,2012-04-05 17:51:00,6254,guys have been getting them good until last week !!! some impressive fish too !!! haliburton area north has been great
684065,trapshooter,2012-04-05 22:06:00,1234,"in my experiences, IMMEDIATELY after ice out they are still deeper.  Takes a bit of warming weather to get things happening in the shallows.  Up here you can catch lakers 'shallow' through the month of June."
684214,Sinker,2012-04-06 04:20:00,8692," Ditto.......usually just when the black flies start, the lakers are hot in the shallows!  S."
684225,chris.brock,2012-04-06 07:26:00,4053,"I agree, just after the ice goes out, it's like a needle in a haystack, some deep, some really deep, some suspended, but none of them very active I'm going to Haliburton for a 4 day easter weekend, the ice has been out for over 2 weeks but it's been pretty cool weather, I'll see what happens"
684229,singingdog,2012-04-06 10:25:00,1047,"Lakes in this area they have been in the shallows for at least 10 days. My buddies dad has had a couple of 30 fish days, all in less than 15' of water."
684448,Jigger,2012-04-07 01:05:00,1237,"Got out for a bit today. Didnt mark anything, and the shallow areas that have produced in the past were vacant. Water temps varied, but hovered around the 40deg mark. No wind would be a blessing for tomorrow."
684452,moose,2012-04-07 01:18:00,266,we fished today for lakers 12-14 landed ad a good a little chappy and windy but fish are biteing
684459,livinisfishin,2012-04-07 01:35:00,661,What kind of lures are you guys using when fishing for them in the shallows?
684515,musky66,2012-04-07 10:59:00,273,"Spoons and minnow baits when I am out, when they are shallow and active I have had great success with  Rapala spoons, Husky Jerks and Smithwick Rogues"
684544,pike slayer,2012-04-07 14:01:00,1177,I find it takes 2-3 weeks and some nice weather with the bugs to start coming out before they are in shallow and binge eating before they head deep. the lakers are like ahhhhhhh the sun!! and it takes a couple weeks for their eyes to adjust hahhaaha!
684699,lickmyarmpit,2012-04-08 05:10:00,359,"Got into a few today on lake ontario,there starting to move out to deeper water.   Marked most of our fish from 90 to 110 purple and black was the color of the day.  Very fat fish must be eating well......"
