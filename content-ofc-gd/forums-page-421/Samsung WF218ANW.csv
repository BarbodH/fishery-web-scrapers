684760,vance,2012-04-08 14:48:00,719,any ways my old Kenmore it started to do the same thing and I found out after taking the drain system apart a smallish drill bit (that I had been looking for) had jammed the pump.After removing that and $10 worth of change from the pump it worked fine.  vance

684769,mercman,2012-04-08 15:04:00,7054,  Sounds like the pump may be blocked.I believe there is a filter/button trap at the pump that you can remove and clean.Also check the drain hose for blockage.The machine has a st amount of time to drain before it enters spin mode.Is there an error code on the display?
