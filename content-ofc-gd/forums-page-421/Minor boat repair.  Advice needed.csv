684851,Jer_H,2012-04-08 20:03:00,25,"First off, Happy Easter!  At the end of the season last year, I pulled a little too hard on a hinge on my front casting deck and pulled a couple screws up.  What would the best way be to secure them back down.  A friend suggested to simply use a larger diameter screw, however I'd prefer to somehow fill the existing hole and re-use the original screws.  Suggestions?"

684859,Tom McCutcheon,2012-04-08 20:29:00,627,"Times two, if you have access, remove the screws, drill out the hole all the way through and install stainless bolts and lock nuts."

684874,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 20:53:00,2234,"Peg the screw hole with a peace of wood with Welbond glue. let glue dry then use the original screw or new, a little bigger if you like. Make sure Stainless screws. Whittle the peace of wood to a point"

If not use a good epoxy, mix with some thickening fibres, fill the hole, soak the fastener in WD-40 and slowly turn the fastener into the epoxy filled hole.  This will allow you to remove the screw but will be very strong.   "
