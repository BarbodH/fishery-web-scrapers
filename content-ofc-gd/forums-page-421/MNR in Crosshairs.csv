681326,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 01:04:00,2449," MNR in crosshairs <h3 class=""npSubheadline""></h3> By GORD YOUNG The Nugget  Updated 9 hours ago The provincial government may be planning to hammer yet another nail into the coffin of the once visible and respected Ministry of Natural Resources.  Lumped in with pay freezes and pension reform for public employees, the axing of planned corporate tax cuts and making well-off seniors pay more for drugs, Tuesday's provincial budget included a section titled Ministry of Natural Resources Transformation.  It's not likely to get more than a mention in the flurry of articles and tweets coming from Queen's Park. But here in the North, the MNR plays an important role -- albeit one that has been diminishing.  As is the case with most government announcements, it's unclear exactly what the provincial Liberals have in mind.  But it doesn't sound positive.  According to the budget, the province plans to ""conduct resource management with a stronger regional focus and fewer field offices; and redesign its science and delivery activities to shift away from a species-by-species approach to a risk-based ecosystem/ regional approach.""  The province is also looking at ""transforming key parts of legislation, regulations, policies and guidelines with a view to streamlining and automating permitting processes and requirements.""  Streamlining, automation, regional focus, fewer field offices ... that sounds a lot like downsizing and centralization.  The provincial ministry responsible for fish and wildlife never recovered from cutbacks in the 1990s and  deteriorate during the past decade.  Environment Commissioner Gord Miller highlighted the issue with a scathing report released in 2007 suggesting gradual but steady erosion of funding, staffing and expertise at the MNR left the province's ecosystem at serious risk for  catastrophic events.""  It was around that time that MNR workers in several Northern communities, including North Bay, staged bake sales to draw attention to the funding deficiencies, claiming they wanted to raise money to fill enforcement vehicles with gasoline because operating expenses for conservation officers had been slashed.  There has not been much communication from the MNR or its workers in recent years. Perhaps that's because there are too few of them left and they see little hope the MNR can be rebuilt.    Biologist Dave Fluri, a steward with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, said the MNR can't take anymore downsizing.  If that happens, he said the government may as well completely shut it down.  Fluri said the danger associated with a adopting a regional approach to fish and wildlife management is losing touch with what's really happening on the ground in specific areas.  John Thornton, chairman of the Greater Nipissing Stewardship Council, said he doesn't quite know what to make of what's proposed for the MNR in the budget. But Thornton said he doesn't have much faith in the provincial Liberal's commitment to Northern Ontario.  Thornton said he has some serious concerns, especially when he reads about a regional approach and fewer field offices.  He said the loss of the North Bay MNR district office would hurt his organization, which heavily relies on the expertise and resources that's currently there.  The MNR is an easy target because it plays a less prominent role in southern Ontario and the effects of cutbacks aren't necessarily immediately apparent.  But the thought of even fewer eyes on our lakes and forests, fisheries and wildlife populations is worrisome.  We need to be careful about how much we take from nature and we must be mindful of the implications of our decisions on habitat.  The MNR has long been the guardian of those resources -- an essential role that's more important today than ever before.  "

681331,Rod Caster,2012-03-29 01:20:00,5784,Can't say we didn't see this coming.  brutal.  Our Environment is so easy to ignore from an office.  
681332,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 01:21:00,0,soon i will stop purchasing licenses...  i`m not giving my license fees to build roads in the GTA or pay mpp`s 6 figures to gut the mnr.
681342,bigugli,2012-03-29 01:40:00,6138,"Streamlining, downsizing, simplifying....   Sounds like more excuses for watering down environment and resource protection for the benefit of corporate interests/ More clearcut logging, pit mines, tailing ponds and quarries."
681348,troutologist,2012-03-29 01:47:00,951,"Make the environment an election issue...the gun registry was a huge one, why can't folks wanting accountability for resource protection and stewardship."
681351,Nipfisher,2012-03-29 01:51:00,2449,"Yep, Joey. I think there is only 3-4 officers for this region. 2 that I know of in West Nipissing.   ""Streamlining, automation, regional focus, fewer field offices ... that sounds a lot like downsizing and centralization."""
681352,bigugli,2012-03-29 01:51:00,6138,Because most victims/the public don't like to admit they've been raped.
681363,Grimace,2012-03-29 02:13:00,2020," I am usually in agreement with you on many issues (this being one of them) but this statement of yours is asinine.  You are suggesting that in the future,   your fishing licensing fees will be used to pay for the paving and maintenance of Toronto roads?   What is this thought based on?  Your vitriol for Toronto is getting weirder by the day."
681364,chessy,2012-03-29 02:14:00,610,not a big deal with the wardens downsizing them.... hold on ..   most of the sit in there office waiting for the tips line or the crime stopper line to ring so they can go investigate very little driving around exempt of for opening days
681366,Grimace,2012-03-29 02:17:00,2020," Correct.  That is why people who have a Dodge/Ford/GM/Toyota swear up and down that their's is the best, because it would break their heart to admit that they have been duped or did not make the best decision.   Blind patriotism/faith works the same way."
681408,Jer,2012-03-29 10:17:00,1426,"...but I thought it was only wacky right-wing, bible-thumping ""neo-cons"" that did this type of thing...not Daddy Dalton, say it ain't so..."
681409,Bondy,2012-03-29 10:24:00,40,I worry we will end up with environmental leftists running the MNR like they have in Germany and other socialist countries. Resource management should not be infiltrated by the liberal's left wing green agenda or we will see our access and historical rights to use our provincial resources slowly and incrementally dwindled in the name of 'science'.
681412,Bondy,2012-03-29 10:33:00,40,"In Michigan to save money the Michigan gov't combined the Department of Environmental Quality with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources...that didn't last long. If the MOE and MNR were to be combined to save money (I don't know whether this is planned or not-but it could be done) then you would see code words like 'ecological preservation' used instead of the term they really mean which is translated to 'limited access to sportsmen'. I've seen enough of the agenda driven, money losing windmills and solar panels within 5 km's of my house to make me very worried about who has wormed their way into the MNR senior ranks."
681415,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-29 10:59:00,4399,I didn't vote liberal!!!  Like someone said make it an election issue!
681434,aniceguy,2012-03-29 12:24:00,1094,"the MNR was an election issue two cycles ago, there was a clear cut policy document that the tories ran on.  It covered parks, fee for service, enforcement, Special purpose acounts, increase in CWFIP and lots more a really good map for the rebuilding of the MNR.  I wrote much of the policy the was adapted and put into the campaign I can dig it out and post it sadly someone decided to bring line 87 of the blue book out and tory lost the election. The MNR is continuing to get a gut once again.  The liberal cabinet office has no care of concerns for the environment, hence the risk management policy.  I think sooner or later someone will sue the MNR over its lack of capacity, and heaven forbid someone gets hurt due to the provinces mismanagement of its affairs.  Lately all I hear is ""MNR cant do that due to its lack of capacity""  so the do nothing approach is taken which is simply unaceptable.   Organize a 10,000 person march on Queens Park and I think some changes might ocur, sadly if it was organized 100 guys would show up..and thats a true symptom, in the absense of revolt the government assumes all is ok. Consider ourselves lucky we have what we have."
681506,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-29 14:34:00,0," it's a metaphor grimace.  our licenses are being collected and not reinvested into the fishery.  those of us in the north have a bit of a chip on our shoulder with regards to how decisions are made in offices far away that greatly impact the north and how with regards to health care, road maintenance, and education we are treated as 2nd priority.  crown land access rights, the cancellation of the spring bear hunt, non-existent natural resource funding, flawed forestry allocations, ontario northland sake, etc are other decisions made that aren't noticeable for residents of more populated areas.  when i refer to ""toronto"" it is referring to our provincial capital, and home of the politicians making these decisions, not the citizens of the big smoke.  i hope this clears it up a bit."
681514,Headhunter,2012-03-29 14:46:00,5703, Thanks for clearing that up Doc... I was beginning to wonder as well... HH
681519,torco,2012-03-29 14:49:00,656,"When the budget came out there was a small blurb but didn't sound good. If I am not mistaken all these cuts amount to 13-20 million dollars which has a huge impact on the management of the resources but is peanuts for balancing the books. My suggestion to the Liberals is they clean up the mismanagement in the large portfolios like healthcare before they gut the small portfolios like the MNR. Christ, what ornge has wasted would do wonders for the MNR.  Very disappointing budget that showed no creative thinking and planning (and I am not anti-liberal)"
681671,Jer,2012-03-29 20:19:00,1426,"  The horse-race industry had a few marches with semi-impressive numbers, still got them nowhere. They'll all be outta work as soon as the OLG pulls their slot-machines."
681687,coreyhkh,2012-03-29 20:44:00,163,"We spend way to much on health care, I would rather see more money put in to protecting what little natural spaces we have left. The way the health care and schooling system is now does not work the government just keeps pumping money into it with little effect.  In 40 years I don't think there will be much point in living as the world will be pretty much a waste land do to Human greed."
681712,Grimace,2012-03-29 21:32:00,2020,"Yeah, cut health care and education.  Health care and education are two of the most important things we have.  They are the two things we have that are not born of the greed that you are complaining about.  Corporate tax is at an all time low world wide and the corporations are agitated that it is still too high. Lol.   Maybe we should get the corporate tax back to a reasonable rate before we cut health care and education."
