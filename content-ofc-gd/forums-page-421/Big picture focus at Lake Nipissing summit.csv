Presentations at the Lake Nipissing Summit Tuesday morning focused on fishing pressure over the past century, climate change science and water quality data.  Options for strategic studies and improved fishery management will be discussed today as the two-day event wraps up at Nipissing University's Chancellor's House.  Richard Rowe, a biologist with FRI Consulting, said negative trends in spawning-size walleye noticed first in 2009 only make sense if there was an unexpected harvest.  Rowe used a digital slide show to demonstrate how data from fall walleye index netting correlated with fishing pressure over the past 10 years.  He said spawning-size walleye increased in 2004 as slot regulations for anglers and Nipissing First Nation's commercial fishing management systems, including nets that allow larger walleye to escape, were introduced.  But the line graphs showed drastic changes recently.  “Extra harvest had to occur in 2009 and 2010,” he said, noting the data makes the most sense when non-compliant commercial activity (including commercial spearing during the spawn moratorium), more anglers taking slot fish and possible Dokis First Nation commercial activity.  Rowe, formerly a biologist with Nipissing First Nation and the Ministry of Natural Resources, said there's an abundance of young walleye, but they seem to be skinny and maturing slowly.  He said the challenge is ensuring a greater amount of young walleye survive the double gauntlet of commercial and angler pressure to reach spawning age.  Bharat Pokharel, of Nipissing University's faculty of arts and science biology, explained how the green house effect is increasing temperatures around the globe.  While the cause can be debated, Pokharel said thousands of natural thermometers prove overall warming trends are happening.  He urged more studies based on predicted impacts in this region, referring to the potential for more heavy rain events in this watershed, which has a tributary collection system many times the actual size of Lake Nipissing.  “Are we ready for these things?” Pokharel asked, suggesting that lake level fluctuations, decline in ice quality during winter and fish habitat changes could threaten economies.  He said communities can assess the risks, coordinate long-term data management and integrate safeguards in planning.  Ministry of Environment representative Andrew Patterson talked about chemical water quality studies on Lake Nipissing over the past four decades.  While phosphorous readings in the 1970s and the last studies in 2003-04 are hard to compare due to different analysis and gathering techniques, Patterson said spikes in nitrate levels in Callander Bay in early spring and August raises questions.  “It's definitely worth going back to study this,” he said, adding “chloride concentrations are certainly something that should be tracked.”  The summit is organized by Nipissing First Nation and involves officials from each community on its shores.

683423,Joeytier,2012-04-03 23:50:00,3990,Thanks for posting.  Abundant small fish and a lack of slot fish has certainly been noticed by just about everyone fishing the lake on a regular basis.  Very interested in following this.
685212,capt_hooked,2012-04-09 22:00:00,212,Lake Nipissing's yellow walleye are the result of massive stocking efforts way back in the 1920-30s.  Yellow walleye (which for years have been important to commercial and sports fishing alike on this lake) are not native to Lake Nipissing.  Yet the Ministry of Natural Resources insists that stocking is not a viable option.  If we take more fish out of the lake than can reproduce naturally then we need to re-stock these fish!  There is plenty of natural food in Nipissiing to support all the walleye we can throw into the lake.  The Ministry also warns that stocking fish may compete with the navtive walleye population. Let me repeat myself here:  Yellow walleyes are NOT native to Lake Nipissing.  sheesh...!
