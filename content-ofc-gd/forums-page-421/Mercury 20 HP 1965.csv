I found one deal which really good for my budget. It's 1965 20 HP Mercury. It's a desent shape, owner checked compresion - it's all good. The lower unit was complete rebuilt drive shaft, prop shaft all seals new impeller. Top end was all checked out. New fuel lines and fitting, new tank. Bearings were fine. Complete sand down of motor and repainted with zinc chromate and than a two part paint. This was done 2 years ago. Friend of mine is saying that i don't need it, because i will be in trouble all the time. I don't know what to do? It's quite old motor but how good is it? Is it reliable?  What whould be your advice - should i buy it?"
684873,archer379,2012-04-08 20:52:00,277,i have had a couple late 60s omc products that ran well but you can never tell when something may go wrong. i just bought a snow machine ran fine fair compression took it for a ride worked good second ride 5 km in took a piston out one can never tell. if the price is right keep your 9.9 as a spare

I would think that 65 Merc will suck back the gas, and pollute like no tomorrow.  As for reliability.  It could be a great motor, or if could be a lemon.  You won't know until you get a few hours on it.  Not worth is IMO.  ""edit"" Unless it's DIRT cheap.  If you want a stronger engine, I would suggest something in the 90's.  If you can't afford it right now, then start saving.  Pick up something cheap at the end of this season??"
