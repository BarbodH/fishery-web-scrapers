On sunday/monday/tuesday we have high winds and rain forecast...that will be the end of it.  The weather has been great here the last 2 days and evenings have been spent with Jack and mum casting from shore, love the early ice out....NO BUGS BITING!  I have been setting up ice out pike rigs with a great big sucker minnow while Jack has been casting his combo rod with a jig and minnow. Jack beat me to it this year landing the first fish from our shore...a respectable 27"" pike!  He was reeling in and said to mum....""its stuck on something...i need help"", mum grabs the rod to realise right away its not stuck but has a fish on! Mum reeled it in but Jack's superior jigging triggered the bite! WTG SON!  Roloff is slowly getting braver and venturing deeper into the water...but the water would still be a bit cold on the ole nutsack so i dont blame him for not fully taking the plunge yet!   Anyhoo....here is a pic of Jack';s Jack and some iceout/Roloff/random yardfishing pics from yesterday and this evening.   WTG JACK!                       "
