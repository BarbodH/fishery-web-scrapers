684281,Rod Caster,2012-04-06 14:00:00,5784,Shell completly approves of this plan! Actually that's the only place I fuel up so I guess I'm participating in this plan... Although my Suncor stock says otherwise. I'm conflicted.
684295,Lunatic,2012-04-06 14:39:00,536,i always fill at pioneer. its always cheapest in my area anyways.
684357,express168,2012-04-06 17:29:00,327,"  The stations wil not sit idle though, we all have an amount of gas we all have to buy every week no matter what. As people sit in line ups for 45 minutes at a discount station to save 5 or 6 cents a liter many of us will just pay at the other station to get in and out. An extra 5 cents on a 60 liter fill up for me is $3.00 and my time is worth more to me than that. Plus as the demand at the discount station increases so will their price til it reaches the level of the other guys. The demand remains the same until we actually take cars off the road which isn't going to happen and seeing how they supply the discount stations to their gas is still moving."
684429,Oggie,2012-04-06 23:43:00,588,"Didn't see this thread and started another one. Sorry OP.  I think it would work but as soon as the price drops on the banned companies, the crowd would lose they're resolve and move back to the PetroCanada or ESSO.  If you could get people to stay away from these two for even a week, the prices would change.  There WAS a shortage of refining but that isn't why the price is up currently. This is out and out gouging. They couldn't get it out of us in home heating after the mild winter so they're hell bent they'll make it up in vehicle fuel.  I say let's give it a try. Dan O."
684449,Kerry,2012-04-07 01:12:00,383,"After realizing that I got better mileage with shell midgrade over crappy tire premium last year I only use shell mid grade and premium fuel.I won't waste my time filling up at a station you can smell the ethanol ie sunoco,petrocan,ultramar.Yes I know shell has it too but not nearly as bad as the others and the premium is ethanol free. Kerry"
684477,pikehunter,2012-04-07 02:27:00,1659,"Here's a real hairbrained idea that would demand attention. Biggest problem is that it would never come together.  The entire country unites and everybody in industry, retail, construction, trades, services all of us except for those who are in emergency services does not buy anything at all, all stay home emptying the roads and highways by calling a 2 or 3 day strike. Nothing happens, nothing moves, no stores are open, not one restaurant fries a burger, no money changes hands. It would definately get the point across.  I don't think that 2 days of missed pay will bankrupt most people, it may pinch you but it won't kill you and the politicians as well as industry leaders will have to wake up it and will hurt them more than the us.  Told you it was a wild and crazy idea. And all we have to do is make one call and complain we can't work because we're all sick in bed with ""Gas Pains!"""
684172,Roe Bag,2012-04-06 02:14:00,246,"Copied and pasted from an email I just received.  GAS WAR STARTS MAY 1st 2012   THIS  IS NOT THE 'DON'T BUY' GAS FOR ONE DAY, BUT IT  WILL SHOW YOU HOW  WE CAN GET GAS BACK DOWN TO   $1.00 PER  LITRE.  This  was sent by a retired Coca Cola executive.  It came from one of  his engineer buddies who retired from Haliburton.  If you are  tired of the gas prices going up AND they will continue to rise this  summer, take time to read this  please.  Phillip  Hollsworth offered this good idea.  This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than  the ""don't buy gas on a certain day""  campaign that was going  around last April or May!   It's worth your  consideration.  Join the resistance!!!!  I  hear we are going to hit close to $ 1.50 a litre by this summer and  it might go higher!!  Want gasoline prices to come  down?  We  need to take some intelligent, united  action.   The  oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn't  continue to ""hurt"" ourselves by refusing to buy  gas ...  It  was more of an inconvenience to us than it was a problem for  them.  BUT, whoever  thought of this idea, has come up with a plan that can Really work.   Please read on and join with  us!  By  now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $.99 is super  cheap.  Me too!  It is currently $1.28 at SUNOCO and ESSO for regular unleaded in Hamilton and Ottawa and climbing every  week.  Now  that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to  think that the cost of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $.87 to .99, we  need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the  marketplace..not sellers.  With  the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to  take action.  The  only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit  someone in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas!  And, we  can do that WITHOUT hurting  ourselves.  How?   Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just stop buying  gas.  But  we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a  price war.  Here's  the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY gasoline from  the two biggest companies (which now are  one), SUNOCO(PETRO CANADA) and ESSO.  If  they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their  prices.   If they reduce their prices, the other companies will  have to follow suit.  But  to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of SUNOCO(PETRO CANADA ) and  ESSO gas buyers.  It's really simple to do!  Now, don't  wimp out on me at this point...keep reading and I'll explain how  simple it is to reach millions of  people!!  I  am sending this note to 30 people.  If each of us send it to at  least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ...  and those 300 send it to at  least ten more (300 x 10 =  3,000)... and  so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth group of people, we  will have reached over THREE MILLION  consumers . If  those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends each,  then 30 million people will have been  contacted!  If  it goes one level further, you guessed it.....  THREE HUNDRED  MILLION PEOPLE!!!  Again,  all you have to do is send this to 10 people.  That's  all!  How  long would all that take?  If each of us sends this e-mail out to  ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people  could conceivably be contacted within the next 8  days! Acting together we can make a difference.  If  this makes sense to you, please pass this message on.  I suggest that we not buy from SUNOCO, PETRO CANADA and ESSO UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE  $.99 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN.  THIS CAN REALLY  WORK. REMEMBER â€“ STARTING MAY 1st NO GAS FROM ESSO / PETROCAN / SUNOCO!  Who knows? Could be worth a shot."

684183,bigugli,2012-04-06 02:41:00,6138,I don't buy from those 3 anyways. Lots of small stations always selling gas for cheaper.

The distributors would soon create a  war on a Middle-East country ,claiming that our supplies are at risk....  At the 15 minute mark the price will rise again ....  OPEC can kiss my horse....."
684200,Musky or Specks,2012-04-06 03:15:00,2710,with the nice weather coming my bicycle  is getting a tune up this weekend and it will be biking to and from work again this summer. Saved myself a good deal on gas expenses last year and will do it as long as my ass and legs will let me. Now if more people did that that would hurt the gas companies.  Warning intended for mature audiences  
684202,BillM,2012-04-06 03:17:00,17367, There are 3 major refineries that distribute fuel to ALL stations in Ontario..  You're buying their gas without even knowing it.
684203,irishfield,2012-04-06 03:19:00,26272,"Well I put $168 in my truck today. Thought nothing of it as the drive that fuel is gonna take me on, to meet up with my old school buddies to celebrate 30 years since grad this Saturday.... will be priceless!"
684223,Sinker,2012-04-06 06:25:00,8692,"How do you figure this will work?  If I don't buy gas that day, I will have to buy it the next day. These things never make any sense to me. The gas companies will get their money one way or another. If they lose, they raise the price....its that simple.  S."
684231,Fish Farmer,2012-04-06 10:32:00,2234,"It can't hurt, anything is worth a try. As mentioned above, I refuse to buy from those 3. Something has to be done. Stand together, don't be a sheep."
684233,Twocoda,2012-04-06 10:42:00,4130,the radio stations controlled the gas wars in Alberta years ago....all they had to do was advertise the best gas prices in town...and people flocked to the stations....it worked well but fizzled out as soon as the big guys lowered their prices the momentum was broken...and all went back to gouging again...there were a few small stations that went under too because they couldnt afford to reduce the price...
684247,bigugli,2012-04-06 12:25:00,6138,"But not at their mark up. Every Esso, Sunoco and Petrocan is pegged 2-3 cents more than the small chains here."
684248,Roe Bag,2012-04-06 12:29:00,246," It's not about one day. It's about boycotting the three mentioned. In my neck of the woods, Sunoco has been rebranded Husky. If everyone avoids them. Buys from a competitor. It has to have an impact somewhere in the system.  Suppose Ramp X is gouging. Eveyone starts driving down the road to Ramp Y. Do you not think Ramp X might have to change his tune?"
684250,Roy,2012-04-06 12:40:00,13728,I filled up at $149.9 to visit my Joey in Richmond Hill. Let it go to $3.00.
684254,express168,2012-04-06 12:56:00,327,"Petro Canada and Imperial Oil(Esso) are the main refiners in Canada so even when you buy from the little guys you are buying from them essentialy. What is needed is increased refining capacities, there hasn't been a new refinery built in North America for almost 30 years now because of strict environmental conditions that must be met to get approval. The time to get approval can take about 10 years, so until you can increase refining those that have control of that have control of the prices."
684255,Handlebarz,2012-04-06 13:00:00,3790,it can work if everyone will stick to it this is NOT the STOP FOR ONE DAY CRAP this is BOYCOT THE MAJOR RETAILERS. Another thing is DO NOT SPEND ANYTHING INSIDE THERE STORES they make cash there also. Even thought the mom and pop places buy there gas from the big boys it will still hurt them as they make a killing on there stores have you ever wondered why they have so many new things in there store its covenant shopping STOP that and they will lower the price to get you back. Esso here in Chatham is always one of the first to raise the price Petro only goes down to stay in touch with 7/11. Our shell station is usually good for prices but I buy most from 7/11.  If everyone or most would stop worrying about there air miles or what ever points they get for a few months this could work yes we all need gas but they are just asking us to not hit the major retailer stores. Let give it a try I will for sure what can it hurt lets not do like we have in the past and PISS ON A IDEA BEFORE IT HAS EVEN STARTED.
684256,Fish Farmer,2012-04-06 13:07:00,2234,"You got it,   it's got to hurt some way. If we just sit, we deserve what we get."
684258,Roe Bag,2012-04-06 13:09:00,246, Perhaps! But how many gas stations do you think they want to see sitting idle because people are avoiding them???????
684259,Fish Farmer,2012-04-06 13:10:00,2234,Mike I want you in my army
684264,Christopheraaron,2012-04-06 13:37:00,3525,"There used to be a small gas chain around richmond hill, it was called olco it always had prices at about 5-10 cents cheaper and it was full serve! But only the locals knew about it so all of the people from the hwy 7 and hwy 407 right down the street just went to the shell, people won't go to the local stores if they don't know that they exist, the idea would work it would just be hard for people to find the stations sometimes. Also if we all buy from the small stores then they have a major boost in revenue and maybe they expand their station, you know put in a few more pumps, if when the major companies lower their prices and we leave the smaller ones then they can't afford those changes they just made and suddenly they go under. BUT I still think that if we didn't all just flock back to the big brands and maybe put in the extra time to find little stations this plan could WORK!"
684267,BillM,2012-04-06 13:41:00,17367,  Small stores get there gas from the same place the big ones do...
684270,Christopheraaron,2012-04-06 13:45:00,3525, They still have to pay for it!
684278,BillM,2012-04-06 13:57:00,17367," Huh?  Of course they pay for it...   You realize regardless if you buy fuel at a Esso branded station, the odds are extremely good that the little mom and pop gas station down the street is also using Esso fuel?"
