684350,ch312,2012-04-06 17:01:00,1590," exactly like i said. jealousy brings out the evil in some people.  do you guys honestly believe that a billionaire would hire some joe schmoe lawyers for this purchase? odds are he has a team of expert lawyers that went over every single detail with a fine tooth comb to make sure his ass was covered. on top of that, the government gave him permission to block access so i'll assume he bought the road too. but yeah, a few OFNer's are certainly more informed  the article states that he enlarged the size of the lake by flooding his land before stocking it, so i'll assume more legal mumbo jumbo comes into play under these circumstances. therefore, any part of that water body outside of the original lake was created by him making him the owner, no?  correct me if im wrong, but if a marina excavates channels on a lake aren't they deemed the owners of said water/channels and can post no trespassing?   that said, how many of you would allow the public to have unrestricted access to your piece of paradise? he's living the life that we can only dream about. you're all getting worked up about an issue that has nothing to do with any of us. as someone else mentioned, why not worry about issues closer to home?"
684375,woodenboater,2012-04-06 18:08:00,2277,"Not pointing to this specific case but I think we should be aware of and fight for issues beyond our own borders. We need to help others in their battles if we are ever to expect/hope for outside help in our battles.  There may come a time when there's an issue, oh let's say the Mega Quarry for example, that has no effect whatsoever on someone in another province but they see this as a bigger picture issue where Ontarians could use the support of others. Could be us today and who knows who tomorrow kinda thing.  If people outside BC didn't care, then Clayoquot Sound might not be what it is today and MacBlo may well have cleared it outright.  I believe fisherman, as people benefitting from the outdoors and also giving back to it, need to offer our support (not blindly of course) to those seeking to protect the environment we work/ play in."

684122,irishfield,2012-04-06 00:20:00,26272,"  Thanks for that Peter!!  Always a why him not me world it seems. My mother grew up on the West shore of Glamour Lake (Little Bear in her days), inlet dam to outlet dam. Her Uncle paid for that land with what little he had and also paid someone to build them a home cira 1900 or so. After a few days of walking, from where they were dropped from the train and a horse carrying their gear, they arrived to find that the guy that they paid to build a home had squandered the money and they arrived to find a hand dug footing.. nothing more.. in NOVEMBER. They survived in a make shift lean too and hand sawed all the boards to get a house started before they froze to death as winter was setting in.  A couple decades later with my Grandmother and Grandfather living there, My mother was born in 1926. Her father left home to find work and never came back during the depression. She became the ""father"" of the family being the oldest to help Gramma raise her 5 siblings. Time goes on and even when I was a kid and going to Grammas in the summers (late 60's early 70's), there wasn't another single sole on that lake nor a boat that ever passed by to my remembrance. It was ours to play on. Years fly by and the crown sold off the entire East, North and South shores. My Uncle, now 85 years old would like to severe up some of that massive piece of property. Told he can't.. too many people already on the lake!    The Government made their money selling off the land, but my uncle isn't allowed to. I suspect the next generation, that the land will be left to, may have some energy to attend OMB. I'm in a similar battle up North.. owing the oldest privately owned parcel of land on a lake (20 years before the first cottage) and told by all the ""newbies"" there's enough cottages already and I'm not allowed to develop."

684194,camillj,2012-04-06 02:57:00,1988,"Darn .. so I guess I am in trouble now that just bought some (family owned) waterfront property... guess now everyone should feel free to use the road I paid for,  and the dock I built with my money and sweat .. and perhaps even nap in the Hammock which hangs between the two trees we planted over a generation ago. Heck ... why not feel entitled to sample the food in the fridge of the cottage which is never locked ... after all its right in the middle of a natural paradise.  Don't get me wrong folks, I have enjoyed public lands all my life and hope I will always be able to do so ... but when someone pays AFTER TAX DOLLARS ... especially to the government for crown land - they should have every right to expect their property rights be protected - and if someone is uttering threats about doing harm to them or their property they also have the right to expect to have protection from their government.  Any other attitude would require us all to arm ourselves to be able to provide our own protection .. and that is NOT what my Canada is all about."

684243,aplumma,2012-04-06 12:17:00,6896,Why do you feel that because a man who works hard and has money needs sympathy? This is a legal issue not a wish fest for what people want that can't have. Talk to the government that allowed this man to purchase 100% of the land around this lake. Can a community up North buy all of the land around a lake and not have a public boat ramp on it? Does every body of water no matter how small need a public right of way?  Complain all you want about the people that have worked hard to get a piece of land or even a whole lake it just smoke until you get off your butts and take action in the political arena. Complaining is the easiest thing to do and a spirited discussion on a forum is still nothing more than entertainment for the masses here no matter what side you are on. On the same note the rash of political rabble raising lately has and will be allowed as long as it does not become full of personal attacks or break any of the other rules here. My parting though is from a quote I have forgotten the Author but here it is  Human nature compels most of use to watch a train wreck and given time to call a friend to watch it with.   Art
684263,Grimace,2012-04-06 13:32:00,2020,The roads are public.  He is dumping tree stumps on the public road to a public lake.   He is wrong.  He is breaking the law.  Why the law is not being enforced is a fair question.  The fact that his power and money are allowing him to break the law is something to be concerned about.  The people here are suggesting that the man is well within his rights to do this are just plain wrong.

684271,express168,2012-04-06 13:48:00,327,"The issue is not the land he owns but access because of the public road, the road may have been included in some of this purchase. The transactions need to be reviewed, the province can sell a public roadway hence the privately owned 407 in Ontario. I am not picking sides but I am sure his lawers did a very good job laying out these land purchases to protect his interests just as your lawyer should have when you bought property. Everyone here who is saying that nature can't be owned, give up your homes and property because that was all nature before it was developed and built on just on a smaller scale than this guy.   Everyone likes to believe that billionaires all inherited their money, some likes Gates, Jobs, Zuckerberg,Buffet, Basille, came from families that weren't poor but they created their ideas and earned their billions. There are many others, Micheal Dell, Oprah, Walton,John paul De Joria, Ralph Lauren, just to name a few that started from very little. Don't be upset that they made it, even if your born into it you need to be smart enough to keep it, plenty of fortunes disappear after the idiot son takes over the business. Don't blame him for making it, blame the government for a poorly made deal if that occured. Your right we would all be billionares if it were easy but its not, they do keep many of us employed and if you feel like a slave working for them than do something for yourself and move on. Problem is we are so comfortable that we don't wish to take the risks and challenges, and then just bugger about the ones that did and made it.  Sorry just my rant for the day."
684282,Jer,2012-04-06 14:04:00,1426,   ...bout sums it up for me.
684283,camillj,2012-04-06 14:06:00,1988, That is completely true .. while it is still crown land ... BUT when the government decides to sell it (whether or not we agree it is a good idea)... and collects what it deems to be fair price for it ... and then starts charging the owner property taxes on it .. then everyone else gets the benefit of those tax dollars ... in exchange for giving up enjoyment of that land - otherwise why would anyone buy anything from anyone (especially the government) ?
684287,Grimace,2012-04-06 14:13:00,2020,"  Correct.  But again, we are not talking about his land, we are talking about the public road and the public lake.  If my neighbours and I got together and blocked off the public road going through our properties we would be a committing a crime.  If I owned the properties on both sides of my road and decided the road was mine and blocked it off, would you consider that a reasonable action?"
684296,camillj,2012-04-06 14:40:00,1988,"Not at all Grimace ... and I apologize if I wasnt clear ... I wasn't speaking to the issue of the 'billionaire' who apparantly was told by the authorities that he had the right to block the road (which I can only assume means he owns or has exclusive rights to it) ... I was responding to ZWB's comment where he quoted my original post.  I know first hand that there is often a lot more going on than the observers assumptions might be aware of ...we have had similar issues in our access road and parking area (which our club built on our own private property - and which we maintain with our own money (despite also contributing annually to the 'public access road maintenance' - We keep our private access road gated (and many might have assumed it was once public because before we upgraded the road (and built a proper parking area and repaired/replaced culverts) we never did have a gate - but we do now - mostly to ensure we have somewhere to park legally and to prevent the abuse (trash/garbage, tree cutting for fires etc) by people who have nothing invested in the area ... this in no way prevents access to the lake since there IS another public road controlled/maintained by the province... but it is about 40 minutes shorter 4 X 4 drive from the main road so some people think they have the right to vandalize our gate and trespass across and park on our private property to fish the lake).  We are not rich, we are not arrogant, we do not believe we OWN the lake or the fish in it ... but we do own the land and we have put a great deal of energy and money and thought into our improvements - all with government approval ... so if you see a gate across a road I suggest it would be more appropriate to call the township ... find out who owns the land and ASK them NICELY for permission to cross their property ... and respect their decision if their answer is no ... who knows, you might even make a new friend."

684311,Grimace,2012-04-06 15:08:00,2020,"We seem to be discussing two different things.  I am talking about the guy dumping trees on a public road going to a public lake.  You are discussing something far different.  You brought your situation into this conversation (which I did not address) to make a point. We have now established and agreed that there are differences between your situation and the situation in B.C.  Your drive is private.  You have not even remotely blocked off public access to the lake.  So, with those loose knots tied up, do you think this man is within his right to block a public road going to a public lake because he owns the land around them?  And if so, do you believe my neighbours and I should have the same right to dump tree stumps across the public road that goes between our properties?  What I guess I am asking is this, now that you look at the big differences in the two situations, do you feel differently about the topic?"
684314,Grimace,2012-04-06 15:14:00,2020,"  You have not stated if the access ""Guy"" is blocking is his own or public.  I am assuming public if you are bringing it up. If so revert to your first post. If it is in fact private, revert back to your first post.  Once you figure out where you stand get back to us...."
684319,camillj,2012-04-06 15:19:00,1988,Thanks for acknowledging the validity of my perspective on this discussion in the context of my own experiences.  To answer your question (as best I can) - no I do not believe anyone should be allowed to interfere with public property for their own benefit.  BUT - I cannot presume to have enough information about the facts of that persons specific rights or actions or to know whether what he did was wrong - I would be surprised however that the town (government) would say he is within his rights if he was really interefering with public access to public property. And it was be a very dangerous precedent to condone anyone taking vandalous action based on their own suppositions.  Is it not possible that an invalid assumption has led us all down the garden path ?  The point of describing my situation was to show that sometimes things aren't what they appear (especially when for whatever reason you wish that they were).
684325,Grimace,2012-04-06 15:34:00,2020,"Indeed. Good points.  I am interested to see where this goes.  There is not enough information in this article.  The more I think of it the more questions I have, from how it is managed to the legalities of the sale in the first place."
684328,mike rousseau,2012-04-06 15:42:00,4661,"   alright....  the ""GUY"" owns property on both sides of the creek and put a gate across the water blocking the ""public"" from entering the creek...  once the gate was put in i stayed away...its just a creek and i dont have the ambition to get into a legal battle with the ""guy"" over him wanting a swampy creek to himself... i have more important things to do with my time...""let him have it""  what i was trying to say is who cares what the heck is going on in BC... we have enough issues like this going on in ontario to bicker about...  this will probably never effect any of you directly...  worry about your own backyard...   thats as clear as i can make it for you Grimace... is that acceptable for you? or do you have any more questions?"

683975,Dabluz,2012-04-05 17:23:00,701,"I also believe that nature cannot be owned.  That large plot of once public land was for many years protected by the public with public funds.  This means that everyone participated in the management of this land.  It was not given away to anyone.  It may have been leased to lumber companies at one time, mining companies have surely surveyed this area, trappers have most certainly trapped at one time in this area.  Natives hunted this land to provide food.  Canadians protected this land from invaders.  Hunters and fishermen demanded laws to protect the animals that inhabit this land.  Now....all of a sudden....it belongs to one person.  It's his personal paradise now.  That is not right.  If it had not been protected....it would not be a paradise....it would be a wasteland or a garbage dump for some big city.  I don't mind someone owning the land but the public still has a certain right to continue to enjoy this land and most certainly to enjoy the part of this plot of land that is public.  I've seen many lakes in my area become encircled by private land.  Only the land owners can now enjoy these lakes now.  It's getting to a point where even huge bodies of water like the Great Lakes, the St-Lawrence Seaway, our ocean coasts are becoming less and less accessible to the public."
683977,Ben_Daniels,2012-04-05 17:42:00,435,"Everyone seems to be using the words land and nature interchangeably? If the guy owns the land its his choice what he wants to do with it.

683978,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-05 17:45:00,0,"  i have been the most vocal on ofc against the blocking of roads in northern ontario and anywhere else.  it should also be added that lakes are federally legislated, and is owned by the crown... aka the canadian people!  so we, the taxpayer own that lake.  if you want a better analogy, think of it as owning a home but you're told you can't go to it because you don't own the land around it."

If you want to fish it you need to ask for permission and some will allow you that privilege. Remember all land was owned by the government at some time it doesn't matter if it was 5 years ago it changed ownership or 400 it is now owned by someone other than the government. If you purchase the deed to a plot of land up North and you put a small house up their and grow a lawn and one morning you find a man has pitched a tent up and was sitting in front of a campfire you would be a little grumpy. You run outside and ask what the heck he is doing and he says""It was Crown land and my dad used to take me hunting up here as a kid and I decided to come back and hunt again."" Would you say that's fine have a nice day or call the police... don't kid yourself here comes the police for sure. Just because it was once Crown land if the Government sells it your issue is with the government not with the person who buys it.

683831,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-05 03:33:00,0,"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/04/04/bc-fishing-ranch-dispute.html  A dispute is escalating between the American billionaire owners of a massive B.C. cattle ranch and a local fishing group.  The fishermen say the ranch is blocking their access to two public lakes located on the Douglas Ranch near Merritt, B.C.  The 200,000-hectare property — reputed to be the largest working cattle ranch in Canada — is owned by billionaire Stan Kroenke, who's also owner of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche. His wife, Ann Walton Kroenke, is the daughter of Wal-Mart department store founder Bud Walton.  Members of the Nicola Valley Fish and Game Club claim ranch managers are illegally blocking access to Minnie and Stoney lakes, by dumping tree logs on a roadway that is publicly owned.  ""This is definitely an attempt to keep us the heck out of here and off a public road,"" angler Rick McGowan told CBC News. ""They're trying to lock us out of half a million acres of Crown land and all the lakes and streams in there.""  The fishermen say the last time they went ice fishing, the ranch manager confronted them, calling them trespassers.  But while they insist the road is public and their only access to a public lake, the provincial government disagrees and has told them the ranch can lock the gate, blocking access.  Ranch manager Joe Gardner says the lakes are surrounded by private property and only the middle of the lake is public because the once tiny body of water has been enlarged, spilling onto private land.  McGowan argues that Kroenke may have flooded his own land, but that doesn't change the status of a public lake.  But Gardner says the ranch stocks the lake with rainbow trout and anyone who fishes them is stealing, the same as if someone stole a cow.  ""It doesn't make any difference how much money Mr. Kroenke has. What matters is what our legal rights are. We have private property rights,"" said Gardner.  The Nicola Valley Fish and Game Club is now raising money in hopes of suing the ranch owners for access to the road to the lakes and the club intends to ask the BC Wildlife Federation for help."

683838,Twocoda,2012-04-05 04:22:00,4130,Now this is going to be an interesting situation to follow
683853,12footspringbok,2012-04-05 11:17:00,459,I don't like it one bit... This type of thing is happening everywhere. This winter up north I noticed a few more old trails had been gated up... What worries me the most is how alot of these different stories parallel The UN's wildlands project...   Coming to a favourite fishing hole near you!

683867,Skipper D,2012-04-05 12:25:00,1970,"Heres how i see it from the other side of the fence wearing the other guys shoes , i'am only writing this so ill know that every one here did take a look at the both sides of this story ,  i wont be sticking around to defend it either . I once worked for a guy like this and because of his wealth and for what all he owned i was never comfortable in letting any one know who i worked for , besides  him not being to well liked by the less fortunates around . Some here will know who am talking about when i say Cold Spring Farms with Harvey Beatty as its owner . I did grow up on a small famiily farm and real enjoyed the oppertunity Cold Springs gave but i was still shy to say so till one day they did an interveiw with Harvey on national tv . Because of who he now was , they atacted him pretty good , and their main consern was how big he had become and how he might be hurting others . What they did'nt talk about was the four hundred or more people he employed and how he was considered to be a god send to his community . When Harvey was asked the question about weather or not he thought he was hurtting the smallers guys around who were trying to make a living doing the same things farming , his answer ........... Harvey said he did'nt think he was hurting any one because he had started off as just a small family farm him self . So for me when i put the shoe on the other foot so to speak and if i was either lucky or worked my butt off , in most case's its worked your butt off and some of us do that a bit better then others i'd have to say . Amagin if this was you and you managed to buy land up with your hard earn money like we all do because thats how we get to keep it ............ then have a group come one day and tell you they have rights to part of it ? When i read the above post i could'nt help but think how i might have aproched this  land owner with a commity of buisness men with a buisness proposition that might have been a win win for every one on sharing this body of water ....... but first , dose any one know if the fishing is any good there ? Have fun with it gentlmen and thank you for letting me add my twist to it ."
683873,Dave Bailey,2012-04-05 12:59:00,1641," Good for him, but that doesn't give him the right to restrict the liberties of others.   The point is that a person should not have the right, at least in my opinion, to buy up land surrounding what was formerly public lakes and then restrict access. Let them buy up a lot of it, but the access should be maintained.  Until it's resolved I would take the interim stand that he can't own the water, and would be encouraging fly-in operators to access it constantly with floatplanes. Wait until he gets tired of a few Cessna 180s and 185s flying in and out, props screaming away in fine pitch. And a bunch of ultra-lights buzzing their lawnmower motors over his house, (the local ultra-light schools might like to use it as an area for float training). After a while he might prefer the peace and quiet of a vehicle on a road."
683876,BillM,2012-04-05 13:01:00,17367,"If you want to buy up land around a public lake, you still need to provide access to the public.   Seems simple enough."

We live in a country/civilization were $$$$ always wins even when it loses it wins because he can afford the legal team to keep this tied up in court for a long time. The fisherman can't.

683906,cityfisher,2012-04-05 14:43:00,959, Not the case. This has been discussed before.  All the land around the lake is private.. anyone trying to access it is treepassing.. Thats a fact.. Call your local CO .. he will say the same thing
683907,bushart,2012-04-05 14:49:00,2628,I'm of the understanding that if there has been an established access over time---it cannot be cutoff  Kind of like a right of way
683913,Christopheraaron,2012-04-05 15:03:00,3525,Looks like Canada is going to have to buy us all helicopters to get to the centre of that lake!
683915,Harrison,2012-04-05 15:07:00,2202," Not sure, but does there not have to be an allowance on a body of water?  Reason I mention this is an old friend worked for a conservation authority and we hunted a private lake once but gained access through an allowance.  If I remember right the allowance was only 25ft wide or so and you would never of found it without a map."
683918,Grimace,2012-04-05 15:23:00,2020,All this talk of a right of way does not matter in this instance.  There are public roads going through the ranch.  If you buy up a pile of property on either side of the road it doesn't give you the right to block the road with tree stumps.  It is a public road and he is not within his right to block it.  The lakes are public and he is not within his right to block them.  The only reason he is getting away with this behaviour is probably because he has plenty of money and power.
