That all came about years back when some political type found out that a few hundred tonnes of lead were SOLD each year in Canada so he assumed they were ALL ending up in the water.  Guess he never thought to ask me or about a million other anglers how many pounds of lead we have collectively still in our possession.  Lotsa controversy on this subject but I did find that one mislead fact seemed to be at the forefront for all those complaining.  Michael
