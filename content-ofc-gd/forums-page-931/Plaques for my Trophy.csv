276432,Leecher,2008-12-06 21:37:00,7832,"Guys,  It's been some time since I could work on my trophy project and last night went to Rona and bought a Pine edge glued panel 11/16"" x 16"" x 36"" made by Brico Pano.  I thought I'd buy tongue and groove pieces of pine but could not find any thick enough for what i wanted so this piece I found just satisfied my likings.  This morning, started to work on the template because the one I had was not big enough..... here a pic of the two    The blue is the one I had for the smaller racks but had to make a bigger one.   Got to work and this is the results    I laid down my trophy on it just to get a feel for what it was to look like..... and this is the results    Since the piece of pine I've bought was big enough, why not make a couple more    Now I have to figure out where I'm going to hang it on my trophy wall.... the wife won't accept that I put it above the fireplace and this is the only wall I can hang it amongs the others    Roy, TJ, Spiel the other two plaques are available for the auction if need be and will ship them at no cost to the highest bidder. My Christmas gift to me is almost finish and real proud of it Hope you enjoy! Leechman"

276446,highdrifter,2008-12-06 22:22:00,2534,Aye stun beau travail d'artisan!  Shame it had to be pine and not birds eye for such a presentation.  The light wood exentuates the dark of the antlers well though.  cheers HD
276452,misfish,2008-12-06 22:28:00,29133,"Birds eye would of been awesome. Great job Jacque,and what a great offering to the auction."
276454,Leecher,2008-12-06 22:30:00,7832," Thanks HD.... Pine is the only wood that I can find at a lower cost and it's easy to cut, router and sand down. Real proud of it"
276456,Leecher,2008-12-06 22:34:00,7832, Thanks Brian..... were you out today on the hunt??
