According to the weather reports we will be having double digit figures at night for the next couple of weeks and the ice conditions should be in good shape.  We have a walleye guide that meets at our store and his name is ""Hawg Hunter"" and he is extremely knowledgeable of the Bay of Quinte and most likely will be one of the first guides to head out on the ice and check the thickness of the ice etc. in time for ice fishing season. I know that some members here on OFC has used Hawg Hunter in the past and have had excellent results with him.  As soon as we get good ice conditions I will be posting here as well as updating my site on a regular basis and hopefully we will see a few OFNer's this year up here to fish and with any luck I will hopefully join you for a great time on the ice.  Well all I can say now is bring on the ""Hard Water Season""  Best regards, Sam"
