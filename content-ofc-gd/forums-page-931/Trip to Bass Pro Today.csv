To my much happy suprise I find tucked away amongst the hook aisle the new Mustad Slow Death hooks.  These simple worm hooks designed to spin a crawler just like a salmon flasher and fly. They've been the secret of the pro walleye tour for the last 2 years. I saw a bit of footage on them in the spring and figured to bend my own. Experimented with a few in temagami this summer and caught fish pretty consistent on windy points drifting.  For all you walleye guys, these are pretty neat and so simple it amazing nobody thought of it before. Ran a 3/16 brass sinker, ball bearing swivel and 6ft of 8 lb flouro to one of these hooks.  Oh yeah I bought a new turkey slate for next spring, gotta start practicing now."

277079,fishindevil,2008-12-08 16:24:00,6254,"Yes indeed they do work very well,and they really do have an awesome spin on them !!!! i have used them several times this year,and caught a few nice walleye on them....i also slide a soft glow bead on to the very top part of the hook shaft,just before the bend....it helps make it a little more visable,when its dragging through the dark weeds & bottom debris !!!!   cheers"
