276621,waterwolf,2008-12-07 06:03:00,556,my hunting bud was scouting a new area this fall and discovered a huge deer carcass . a pack of coyotes cleaned this animal down to bone right up to the skull . probably wounded by a hunter and layed down to retire where my buddy found it. this rack is very impressive for a six pointer and really should be measured by a certifified person .it has the length and mass of a decent 10 pt'r. my buddy has moderate interest but i'm all over it . any info would be greatly appreciated.
276629,richyb,2008-12-07 06:44:00,774,"look up pope and young on the web ... they have a page that shows you how to score a deer . .a 6 point would have to be massive to havea decent  score,  so i doubt that would even make the required 125 for p&y..  do you have any pics of the antlers ?"
276630,waterwolf,2008-12-07 06:58:00,556,"thanks for that info . you'd usually be correct in that thinking 'bout a 6 pointer not gettin' a decent score ,, different animal here. one of those reasons to have a camera always present.  you won't see many like this !!   it's got to be 22 in or better inside , 6 or so bases with 21 in mains .these are not actuals.  wish i knew more 'bout the age etc. , just for the simple fact of what could this deer have become????"

276969,waterwolf,2008-12-08 04:14:00,556,"talked to my buddy 'bout gettin' it scored and he's all for it. if i finish work early one day this week i'll head over pick it up , get some pic's and drop it off to get it scored."
