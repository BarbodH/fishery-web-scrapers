276558,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-07 02:23:00,64,Yea thats a good idea. I might just have to steal that idea.
277014,tinbanger,2008-12-08 12:53:00,1028,"Patent pending !!!  Can't take the credit , stole the idea from numerous OFC posts .Works well and best of all ...cheap  TB"
277084,osmondrs,2008-12-08 16:38:00,61,"Good one, Dave...  Nice to see you got your first muskie.  Congrats!"
277085,wuchikubo,2008-12-08 16:40:00,1114,Congrats on your first and PB!
277117,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-08 18:20:00,1362,Congrats on your first Muskie Dave!!  ....what a nice color on those Niagara Muskies!!....  Man do I ever miss the soft water and boat
275600,tinbanger,2008-12-04 23:57:00,1028,"And not just any Muskie    My First Muskie  after a few weeks of getting snowed in I finally picked a good day .Temperatures into the single digits and sunshine . Met up with Hometownhandyman in Hamilton and after a quick stop a CTC ( Left boots at home   ) we headed off to the river . Arrived at the Netherby ramp around 10:30 ( after a tour of the surrounding farmland  ) Ramp was bare and dry ..however the water was heavily stained (brown)  Launched and headed up stream .Water clarity seemed to improve as we got into deeper water a bit farther upstream , although wasn't much better than maybe 12-18"" .water temps at 39 degrees. Trolled a few hours with only the odd 'tick' showing on the electronics.Clearing weeds was the only exercise we got . Enjoyed the company the scenery and the snacks ! Watched the us coast guard run up and Down the US side  Decided to try a firetiger grandma and that was what proved to be effective as this pretty little fish was on my line not 30 minutes later.quick measure (34"") and a quick release ( she thanked me with a nice face full of cold river water) wire cutter came in handy as she had chomped down good on the front treble .  After several trips out this year it wasnice to actually hold a fish , not big ...but hey my first!  Tinbanger"
275617,douG,2008-12-05 00:22:00,2693,"Looks a lot like my first muskie, caught out of season, and some one else's boat ( Colin), about 5 years ago.  We were fishing the lower N, bouncing junk for steelhead in March, when I snagged up.  Reeled down, another firm tug, still tight.  Then I gave 'er a snap, and that's when the drag started to buzz.  That fish fought tough, and an honour to land it.  Congrats on your PB."
275626,lew,2008-12-05 00:55:00,12767,WTG Dave and congrats on your 1st ever musky.........that's excellent  Good to see the plan came together for you.
275629,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-05 01:09:00,3761,"Congrads man, very nice musky man!"
275630,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 01:13:00,8163,Great lookin' 'Skie for a first!!!  Congratulations!!!
275636,jwl,2008-12-05 01:30:00,1056,"right on, way to practice up for the 13th..I am pretty surprized as the water was pretty stirred up for a couple days..it's getting better today.....that's a good sign, nice spunky little river musky there  looks like you beat the odds and got into a fish even in the crappy conditions.  I have a couple spots in mind for next weekend"
275646,smbhunter,2008-12-05 02:04:00,186,Congrats on your first musky. Nice colour pattern on that fish.
275649,limeyangler,2008-12-05 02:17:00,5204,   Congrats on the first musky!   I am still a musky virgin....lol
275653,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-05 02:25:00,64,Congrats on you first musky!
275656,Pigeontroller,2008-12-05 02:38:00,2793,"Yes, congrats on the Muskie! They are a very addictive!  Did the Coast Guard boat have the 50 cal. on the bow?"
275676,Leecher,2008-12-05 03:23:00,7832,Great report and pic Dave  Congratulation on your first ski Must feel real good to finally get one.... I'm still ski'less but will have to try next season  Again great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
275679,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-05 03:26:00,2038," Well we could always give it one more try this weekend Jacques ,,"
275681,Leecher,2008-12-05 03:34:00,7832, I thought you said that you had winterized the Princecraft..... but if you insist
275699,HTHM,2008-12-05 04:31:00,4082,"It was a very enjoyable day, including the tour of the back-country, which was my fault......Anytime you want to do it again, let me know. Maybe that time I will get a fish too. *dude*"
275706,jwl,2008-12-05 04:52:00,1056," that's musky fishin for ya....everyone who does alot of it, even the most successful guys have days where they just can't seem to boat anything at all....don't feel too bad,I never landed one this year all year except for a couple small OOSers while pike fishing the river in the spring...and closest I came all the rest of the year was losing one about a 4 footer off my dock atthe trailer  For those conditons I am totally impressed you guys got one in the boat  , I live 10 minutes away from where you put the boat in pretty much and keep tabs on the conditions all the time for both the Upper and Lower river, and we had some pretty crap winds and the river was right mucked up, and it just started to get mucked up...that's the hardest time to get anything  .  This slows the fishing right down for a couple days...if it stays that way for a week or more, after a couple days the fish adjust and put the feed on again..only they get a little closer to shore cuz that's where the bait goes,dirty or not, they still gotta eat eventually.  I hope my boat sees one on the 13th, heck anyboat for that matter, I lovecathcing fish, but I get a giant kick out of other people putting a nice fish in my boat..I got no probs being the net man if I have to  thanks again for the report boys, and kudos for sure for toughing it out and beating the odds"
275722,TerryC,2008-12-05 05:45:00,196,"The first Muskie, that's where the addiction starts. Stay away from tackle shops for a few weeks or you'll end up spending a couple thousand on new muskie gear.  Congrats, nice fish. That one will keep you dreaming all winter.  Clarence"
275737,tinbanger,2008-12-05 12:01:00,1028,"thanks for the replies  Pigeontroller - no gun seen ,maybe we should have taken a run over to see LOL  As far as conditions the water sure was mucked up , but we didn't know enough to stay home .  tb"
275749,corvette1,2008-12-05 12:59:00,1765,congrats on your ski

276503,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-06 23:55:00,64, What kind of tacklebox is that in your pic?
276530,HTHM,2008-12-07 01:24:00,4082,"A pretty clever setup....a milk crate filled with cut up vinyl downspout, works very well IMHO"
