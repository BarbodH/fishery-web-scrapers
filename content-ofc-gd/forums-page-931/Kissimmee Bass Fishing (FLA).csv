I was wondering if anyone can recommend a certain place/business where I could rent a (decent) boat for a few days, and try my luck. I have done the whole guide thing before (see my Avatar picture), and even though its amazing, its also quite pricey.  Ideally I would be able to rent a boat myself for 2-3 days for the price it would cost me to get a guide for one.  Any help is much appreciated!  *Stoty"

You can surf fish for free on the beach and maybe hook into a monster snook, redfish, shark, mackerel, sea trout etc. or you can take a head boat deep sea fishing for app. $70-80 for a full day trip and hook into some grouper and snapper.  Send me a PM if you need any surf fishing tips.  Good luck!"
