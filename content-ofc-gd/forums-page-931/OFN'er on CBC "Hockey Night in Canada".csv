It was our own Crazyhook and his daughter all dressed up in Sens gear cheering on the hometown team. The Senators won 3-2 so I'm sure the two of them enjoyed their day."
276497,SlowPoke,2008-12-06 23:21:00,2984,"That's devestating news... imagine being caught on a national broadcast clad in Sens gear! We're here for you Jamie, if you need to talk."
