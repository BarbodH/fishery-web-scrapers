I had never explored the area before, I usually stuck to the ponds....here are some of the visitors I met.  Here is one of the dozens of black capped chickadees that were feasting on the pine seeds    A Blue Jay that didn't want me around!    I missed a great photo opportunity of an Osprey that flew over head after I scared him from his roost. I didn't miss the redtailed hawk that flew over head seconds after!    A flock of geese that I scared lol      Saw this heron hanging out at the water front. I could have gotten closer, but a dog decided to charge through the bush and scare it off!     This field sparrow was hanging out beside my car door    So I left trying to make it home in time to get my wife to her doctors appointment. But couldn't help but stop at the side of the road when I saw a huge flock of turkeys in the field...this is just a little group. There were many many more!  "
277236,4thgen,2008-12-08 23:56:00,157,Nice pictures! I think that's an American tree sparrow though -- the field sparrows should be well south of here by now. Keep an eye out for the dark spot in the center of the breast that most tree sparrows have.
