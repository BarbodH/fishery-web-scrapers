I was listening to the radio last night and they were saying that it's even made the news in Europe about how Canadians are honouring our soldiers in this way.  Several years ago there were 4 soldiers killed and one of them was from Toronto,  and I attended the funeral service and couldn't believe how many civilians were there for the same reason. There were hundreds of people there and it was so nice to see so many strangers gathered together for the same purpose.  It must mean an awful lot to the guys who are putting it all on the line for us, to know that so many of us back here are appreciative of what their doing and are willing to take some time out of their schedules to show them the respect that they most certainly deserve."

That Canadians once again care for their sons and daughters.  It wasn't that long ago when the news media and the public could've cared less about them. I've 'stood to'  for friends and messmates and seen only a handful in attendance back during the Trudeau years. A minister of defence who declined to attend the funeral of a local son in his riding, killed while peacekeeping. Back when ""soldier""  or ""sailor"" were dirty words.  Careers  "" only deemed suitable for backward yokels and the mentally challenged"" as one Canadian journalist put it.  They faithfully served their country. They have, regretably, died on Canada's behalf. They deserve to be honoured and respected for their sacrifice.  Thank you for your report Hammercarp"
277310,hammercarp,2008-12-09 02:02:00,964,"I dove out to pay my respects today. I live in Hamilton and work in Burlington so I had to drive through Toronto to get there. I like to think that I have a feel for the pulse or mood of the traffic. Today I did notice a difference. People were very well behaved and patient on the 401. It was like everybody knew what was coming down the highway and they would have died of shame if they were the cause of something that interfered with it. My first glimpse of people gathered on the brigdes was at Morningside and then I saw something stuck me as very poignient. Off to the side of one of the bridges standing to the inside of an on ramp were a woman and child, a girl I think. They stood there patiently waiting by themselves for the motorcade to pass by. I was filled with emotion at that site. No parade no flags just a mother and daughter silently waiting to say thanks and pay their respects. I kept driving until I was in Pickering and I heard over the radio that the motorcade had passed Oshawa . I pulled off on Brock road but came back west to Liverpool. I parked at a Tim Hortons and grabbed a coffee. I walked across the the street and started up the bridge . People along the way said hello. I got to where the people had gathered. A firetruck was there with lights flashing. I took up my place beside a gentleman who introduced himself and said that he had been here many times. I said I was from Hamilton . There was a young man beside and we exchanged greetings as well. In about five minutes flashing lights were visilble under the next bridge as the motorcade drew near. As the procession got nearer the man beside me saluted. I slipped my hood off and removed my hat and held it over my heart. Everything got quiet as everone stood still and our attention was on the four funeral hearses that went by. A few more cars and then it was over. The crowd began to leave the bridge. I felt like a wieght had been lifted of of me. I was worried on my trip there that I would get caught in traffic and would not get to do what I had set out to do. A lot of things went through my head on the drive back. Feelings of sadness and pride in my fellow Canadians. I never thought that in my lifetime someone would lay down their life for me. And these soldiers had. They had stood for me and my country and I was glad to have stood for them just for a tiny bit."
