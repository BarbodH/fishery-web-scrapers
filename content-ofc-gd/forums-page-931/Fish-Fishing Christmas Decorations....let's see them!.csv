With those chores completed, and snow flurries in the air, it seemed like the right time to decorate our Christmas tree.  Our little one did most of the ornament hanging, but she wanted to be sure to put some fish/fishing ones up.  Here are some pictures from this afternoon.  Let's see your fish/fishing related decorations!!            Happy holidays everyone!"
