275386,anders,2008-12-04 13:47:00,1168,lets face it..theres a good chance we wont see this guy on the ice anymore.
275390,rickster,2008-12-04 13:53:00,495,I just realized I have wasted minutes of my life thinking and posting about this idiot when I could have been thinking about fishing and hunting  Last time I look at this thread
275407,wallyboss,2008-12-04 14:40:00,1095,"  Nothing ballsy about that!!!!!  He would be ballsy if, when it was time to duke it out that he would stand up and duke it out, instead of doing a good turtle imitation. The guy is a goof. I just hope that the Stars can get out of that ridiculous contract."
275486,blaque,2008-12-04 18:24:00,2419," had me worried for a second there chicken, at first glance, i thought you said.......ah nevermind"
275520,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 19:49:00,612,lol
275578,Greencoachdog,2008-12-04 23:14:00,8163,"Judging by his character, it was only sloppy seconds for the first 2 inches (maybe less) and prolly why she ran off with someone else!  Anybody that idolizes this schmuck prolly has the same problem."
275604,walleyejigger,2008-12-05 00:03:00,876,"  THAT was funny, better watch yourself though you might be the next one attacked by his great wit, lol  the reaction from his own team says it all, shame"
275644,Zubris21,2008-12-05 01:53:00,563,"Gotta say that his comments were a tad tasteless, but I feel for the guy.  Due to his on and off ice nature this situation is being blown out of proportion.  I agree with Chicken and Steve, he is a valuable player on the right team.  Is he worth 4 mil. probably not, are the Dallas Stars the right team for him?  probably not.  But he has grit, tenacity, and yes even talent.  I watched him play many many games in the OHL when he played for Kingston and he hasn't changed a bit.  Was a super-pest then and still is now.  Same can be said about his skill set, the guy has excellent hands, great positioning and draws a ton of penalties.  If he was such an awful player and had not value, he wouldn't have been playing on the same line as Modano.  I don't think he'll play another game for Dallas, but he will find a new home in the NHL.  Also I bet he wouldn't hesitate to drop the gloves with Phaneuf, again in the OHL I saw him drop the mitts with several big defensmen.  Sometimes he got his clock cleaned and sometimes he won, but I never saw him back down."
275647,Radnine,2008-12-05 02:12:00,1538,"Given their past hirings (Tie Domi, John Fergusen Jr., Matthew Barnaby) I say that he will make a nice addition to TSN's hockey panel."
275740,chickenhawk,2008-12-05 12:36:00,612, do you even know what hockey is??? lol
275745,holdfast,2008-12-05 12:50:00,1813,Did anybody care what Phaneuf may feel.  At least its not sloppy thirds that Avery could of stated.  It could be worse.
275763,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 14:05:00,8163," Our definition of hockey down here in the South is a little different than yours.  If you've watched the old tv show MASH, you may have heard Col. Potter exclaim ""Horse Hockey!!!""... he wasn't talking about a game played with or by horses, he was talking about a horse byproduct!  Down hear you may hear a child tell it's mother ""Momma, little Billy Bob stinks... I think he has hockey in his diaper!""   I think the game Hockey got it's name because they used to play it with a frozen Moose turd back in the old days."
275809,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-05 16:13:00,3761,"So it turns out he got a 6 game suspension, 2 of with he has already served.  http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=396352"
275854,Hotrod2066,2008-12-05 18:34:00,40,"6 games for being an idiot???????????????? how many games did the Montreal guy get for smashing the van ryan kids face into the glass from behind? I think it's crap that a guy can get suspended for being an idiot, he said nothing against officiating or the league, it should have been handled by the team, maybe they should ban Ron Mclean for all his crappy jokes. Is it worth more games if you hurt someones feelings rather than smashing their face in or running a guy from behind? I am by no means an Avery fan but I think this is crap."
275858,anders,2008-12-05 18:42:00,1168,Bettman is probably using the Conduct Detrimental to the league.  I think the suspension is about right.  It will be interesting to see what the Dallas Stars are going to do.
275860,walleyejigger,2008-12-05 18:52:00,876,"it's not just for being an idiot, he's a compounding problem, hits from behind and on ice goonery can usually be classified as a spur of the moment incident, this was obviously premeditated, not like he's a first time offender,  he's also ordered to anger management and perhaps counselling, IT""S FOR A REASON,  Manitoba Moose also said they didn't want him if he'd be sent to the minors,  repeat  repeat offender, throw the book at him"
275903,Hotrod2066,2008-12-05 21:22:00,40,"Hollweg was a repeat offender too, and what did he get the last time he ran someone for the third time? I think the discipline in the NHL is a farce. What hurts more and does more damage, having a good player getting run into the boards and being put out for the season and the perp getting 3 games for doing it or a guy goading people with nasty comments. I think this was a matter for internal punishment from the team, the league should have stayed out of it. The league is boring with all the canned answers the players give, it's no wonder nobody says anything because you get suspended if you do."
276045,Zubris21,2008-12-06 01:31:00,563,"I don't think a suspension was warranted at all.  Bettman and the league are too concerned with the ""image of hockey"" not appealing to the masses, that any highly publicized incident like this is going to result in disciplinary actions, deserved or not.  Unfortunately the conduct that really hurts the players and the game isn't drawing attention outside of the hockey world.  The Montreal-Toronto game that was previously referred to should have resulted in several players being suspended for some of the dirtiest play I've seen in a long time.  Heck Carbonneau even said he was embarrassed by his players after the game, and not for a lack of effort.  Like I said before I don't think Avery will play another game in Dallas even if the coaching staff feel as though he can contribute to a winning franchise.  The front office will give him the boot to show their sensitive side and ""clean up the game""."
276772,holdfast,2008-12-07 19:38:00,1813," You may have a point, that could open a can of worms.  Apparently Avery never even got a hearing or Tribunal whatever its called.  Anger Management? What the, seems he was more joking than angry.  Now the NHL will have to come up with a Book on words and phrases you can not use.  Wow, an NHL Human rights commission run by Bettman.  Guilty till proven otherwise."
276796,chickenhawk,2008-12-07 20:26:00,612,no doubt......would love to see some of Avery's comments while in his anger management classes lol
275050,John,2008-12-03 19:27:00,2956," This has absolutely nothing to do with the players value to his team on the ice, which is dubious.  It has everything to do with disrespect to women, his team and to the sport of hockey.  The man (subjective) is indeed a moron!"
275051,steverowbotham,2008-12-03 19:28:00,1800," If there were stats for ""penalties drawn"" you would know his value ... every penalty drawn is a power play and an advantage he gave his team.  Value is not all about numbers."
275052,steverowbotham,2008-12-03 19:31:00,1800," My opinion had nothing to do with the fact that he's an idiot.  I know hes an idiot.  My point was to the people that have such a strong opinion about how he's not a good hockey player, when in fact they dont follow hockey, and dont really know what value he has. He's paid 4 million a season for a reason."
275053,anders,2008-12-03 19:40:00,1168,"yes he draws penalties, however, does it help your team though when he is leading the league in penalty minutes.  If he was doing his job, he wouldnt be in the box.   People are still waiting to see the reasoning."
275054,Mike Pike,2008-12-03 19:47:00,1332,"The Dallas Stars owner doesn't think he's that valuable.  He agrees with the suspension and said if the league DIDN'T suspend him, the team would have!  Most sports bundents I've been listening too say they'd be suprised if Avery plays another game for the Stars."
275057,John,2008-12-03 19:58:00,2956," Sorry Steve, most of us who know hockey also know that he is overpaid by probably 2M a season and that's if and when he keeps his mouth shut. His conduct off the ice erodes most of his remaining value to any team!"
275058,steverowbotham,2008-12-03 20:03:00,1800," He has 3 misconducts .... thats 30 mins right there, which are served, but the team is not penalized.  Without those, he'd have only 47 minutes, still a lot.  But thats his role.  I'm not going to argue my opinion anymore.  I said he;s an idiot.  his off ice antics are ridiculous. However; He's a valuable player to any franchise."
275059,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-03 20:04:00,3761, My thought's exactly.
275060,muskeybugged,2008-12-03 20:09:00,282,"After all his trash talking lately of Dion and Iginla, I think this was his way of getting out of his   whoopin - that I was waiting all week to see.  He's always been the first guy to run his mouth then skate away from a fight that he has any chance of losing. Yeah he'll fight C class fighters.  I hope he gets to play again, only so I can see someone do what's been needed for a long (overdue) time."
275063,anders,2008-12-03 20:11:00,1168,"this is really a good conversation.  i am enjoying it  I have played hocey my whole life, like i am sure most of you have as well.  I know that if i am sitting in the box for 10min at a time....that is not valuable.... at all.  Penalty is a penalty...and those misconducts are the worst of all...cause you usually get them after you already been called for a penalty and cant keep your mouth shut...ive had em....no value to a team in the box...2 min..is a lot better that 10."
275108,Dutch,2008-12-03 22:07:00,831,"  Now that is funny....what Avery said is not.  It is disrespectful and shows a tendancy to mental abuse towards women - maybe why they aren't together anymore.  Good luck finding a new partner that isn't an escort or hooker Avery.  Douchbag!  As far as a previous comment about getting into your opponents head by saying that....if that was by design, Avery sure has issues.  I don't think he knows the difference between what is acceptable and what is not.  If that comment by Avery was pre-meditated, which it seems the previous commenter meant by making the asserttion that the comment was made to get into Phaneuf's head, Avery proves he is a total low-life that doen't deserve to make millions or be in the NHL."
275115,rickster,2008-12-03 22:14:00,495,  Just because he is paid 4 mil a season doesnt mean he is worth 4 mil a season and as far as him being valuable to his team why is the owner and his teamates not sticking up for him turco and richards clearly showed their disgust with him when questioned about it as did the owner  he used to be considered valuable but now i don't see any team thinking his antics are worth it
275117,holdfast,2008-12-03 22:17:00,1813,"Oh GEE WIZ. Tis, Tis, Tis.  Id like him to play for Mtl and put some fire down their throats.  But alas, they may have to play tough hockey.  As far as his comments?  Anybody ever hear of locker room talk.  His only problem is he invited the reporters.  Nobody ever said he was smart."
275194,Zib,2008-12-04 00:40:00,369,Instead of suspending him the NHL should be praising the guy for bringing interest to hockey. They took away fighting & people lost interest. With Avery shooting his mouth off it gets all the sports people on TV & radio talking about hockey & it sparks interest from people & they'll watch the soap opera to see what happens next.
275201,rickster,2008-12-04 01:10:00,495,  so with this line of thinking one would assume a racial slur would be ok too because it is bringing attention to the game  just because it is attention doesn't mean it is good for the game  and as far as fighting goes http://www.hockeyfights.com/stats/
275207,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 01:23:00,612,im gonna have to agree with steverowbotham on this one.....avery always has an impact when he focuses on hockey.....this year.....he has been focused on the media.....after his suspension is served and he is traded from Dallas.....Avery will play some good hockey....   Hawk
275209,J Wilson,2008-12-04 01:28:00,16,"There is no question how Avery approached the media with those comments was a complete act of immaturity. I don't think the league should be suspending him though?. A fine perhaps. Like I was told as a child, sticks and stones break bones but names will never hurt you. I'm sure they are over it now?.  Better yet, they should have let Aves dress and get agrro'd agains the Flames."
275210,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 01:31:00,612,couldn't agree more...as much as i like him...he sure has a beating comin his way....wouldn't it be funny he got traded to the flames.....   Hawk
275225,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 01:54:00,612,For those who haven't seen it....a reminder that this may be offensive to some  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnXC6C_b0CA
275230,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-04 01:57:00,3761,Is this what were all talking about????  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnXC6C_b0CA
275232,ch312,2008-12-04 02:02:00,1590,"i laughed when i saw it and im guessing others did too. its one thing to beak off in the heat of the moment during the game, but this is pathetic. get rid of the useless moron already."
275236,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-04 02:07:00,3761,"   O man u beat me to it, sorry for the double post."
275247,timmeh,2008-12-04 02:24:00,609,Well for those who claim Avery to be a valuable player have a look at how Dallas did last season and in the playoffs. And then have a look at how they are doing this season after signing him. And have a listen to the comments guys like Modano and Turco are saying about his impact on the team.
275289,holdfast,2008-12-04 03:54:00,1813,"Sloppy seconds, havent heard that since I lived in the Shacks (Barracks) Of course it was Guy talk with guys that are not your oversensive guy wannabees now.   Im starting to like the little guy.  Hes got nuts to say that about Phaneuf."
275334,chickenhawk,2008-12-04 12:14:00,612,that's why i like him....he's ballsy....
274914,chickenhawk,2008-12-03 12:06:00,612,as disrespectful as his comment was i couldn't help but laugh.......im not sure he needed to be suspended i think he should have been fined...it was just words...would love to see him traded in the near future....im not sure it's working out in Dallas for him.....wouldn't be surprised if he were to end up in Philly....any1 else??  Hawk
274921,Chris,2008-12-03 12:24:00,405,Chicken....not a good idea to laugh at someone who is making derogatory comments about women on primetime tv. Avery should be booted from the league for this latest dumbdumb move. The on ice stuff is a joke but this is totally unacceptable for the league and over the top even for Avery. He doesn't deserve a second chance this time in my opinion.  Byebye Avery and good riddance
274923,chickenhawk,2008-12-03 12:28:00,612,it's all mind games ChrisS.....gettin into his opponents heads....yeah he stepped over the line.....but he will be back in the league...don't worry...
274925,steve_paul,2008-12-03 12:30:00,658,They should have MADE him play last night and let Phaneuf handle the punishment.   The little crapbag would be living on soup and protein shakes for months.
274926,holdfast,2008-12-03 12:35:00,1813," Hey, thats what Don Cherry said about him last year but not in those words.  Yea, what he said was funny."
274928,chickenhawk,2008-12-03 12:40:00,612,he obviously isn't too concerned about phaneuf or else he wouldn't have said it....
274931,BillM,2008-12-03 12:51:00,17367,That guy is such a moron.   Time to grow up.
274933,chickenhawk,2008-12-03 12:53:00,612,ill bet he don't play in Dallas again this year...
274939,jediangler,2008-12-03 13:27:00,1923,"I agree, you may be right about Philly. Who else would want him?"
274952,rickster,2008-12-03 14:13:00,495,Avery is a jack  hopefully trade him to nashville or atlanta because then we wouldnt have to hear him anymore cause no one pays any attention to either team
274956,JohnF,2008-12-03 14:18:00,3494," I'm thinking he's perfect for the Russian league, unless there's a circus in need of another clown.  JF"
274957,bucktail,2008-12-03 14:21:00,1857,"Ok Ill say it.......... I,ll be happy to take his old girlfriend!"
274960,anders,2008-12-03 14:35:00,1168,send him to Russia..i agree...that way my buddy Chris Simon can make em eat a his meat through a straw.  Phyisical abuse is only tolerated for so long by the NHL....verbal should be the same way.  Its unfortunate that some players had to be the scapegoat....time for Avery to be this scapegoat.
274967,timmeh,2008-12-03 15:01:00,609,"As far as any trade goes, he makes almost $4mil a year. Do you think any team in the league would want him, especially knowing they'll have to pay him that much $$. There are some bad GM's in the league but i can't imagine any one will touch him."
274969,dobee,2008-12-03 15:02:00,301,what a meat head... i hope dion demo's him next time they meet.
274970,fishing n autograph,2008-12-03 15:04:00,2540,Even Barnaby...one of the biggest idiots in hockey history said he stepped over the line. Stuff like that should be left on the ice and not to the media....what an idiot...
274974,Mike Pike,2008-12-03 15:10:00,1332,"If they were 'just words' he wouldn't have been suspended by the league, the team owner wouldn't have come out against him, nor his coach, nor his team mates.  Appearantly, most people think it more that 'just words.'"
274976,fishing n autograph,2008-12-03 15:17:00,2540,"i wonder.....if he's such a tool, maybe he can cross over to football because he'd be a good fit on the Raiders or the Bengals!"
275001,snoil,2008-12-03 16:22:00,139,Not in the manner he did it.The mans an idiot.
275008,Canuck2fan,2008-12-03 16:35:00,1444,It isn't like he didn't have a plan before saying it. I wonder what he thought would happen... If anybody in the league is dumb enough to take him on after this it will be interesting.  To say something like that about one of Canada's rising starlets is just unfathomable. He is just lucky she really isn't Jack Bauer's daugther is all I can say....
275012,Andy,2008-12-03 17:00:00,330,"I think the NHL has to take the high road here and stick to it. Boot him out. He is supposed to be a role model for young boys across the country. Young boys stay up late with their fathers to watch their favorite teams, and they need to spend that time talking about great goals and good hits, not ""Dad, what are sloppy seconds?"" It's not like hockey needs the attention lately, with the Frost trial exposing the darker side of hockey where booze, drugs, poor attitudes towards women,  and poor behaviour are tolerated and accepted as part of the game. Andy"
275017,kemper,2008-12-03 17:14:00,2232,"Just youtubed it...  another event in the circus that is Sean Avery. The thing is, by the media jumping all over it and people talking he is getting exactly what he wants. Sean Avery is much more an attention uh..hoor than he is a hockey player. He has no place in hockey, chirping on the ice is one thing, but deliberatly stirring up as much crap as possible off the ice and in the media is not part of the sport.  Get outta here Avery."
275019,Mike Pike,2008-12-03 17:18:00,1332,"Because ""others have said and done worse"" doesn't mean the league and ownership shouldn't take action.  In fact, I hope other leagues( and owners and team mates of those who choose to behave with that kind of ignorance and disrespect )would take the same kind of action.  Bet ya he doesn't play another game for the Stars."
275037,steverowbotham,2008-12-03 18:46:00,1800,"Everyone deserves an opinion, and while I think he crossed the line, I think people are blowing it out of proportion.  Honestly, how many people on here follow HOCKEY enough to know Sean Avery.  Most ""hockey"" fans, are Leafs fans, or Habs fans, or Sens fans, or Red Wings fans.  You follow your team, and not the whole league.  People who say he doesnt belong in hockey have no clue. Sean Avery is a player who puts up decent numbers every season.  He'll never be a league leader, or even a team leader, but he had like 35 points last season, and he only played 50 or 60 games.  Those are good numbers, and makes him a valued player.  On top of that, Sean Avery is a pest, he gets under peoples' skin, he draws penalties and that WINS games.  Any team, ANY team would benefit with the addition of Sean Avery.  Like him or not, Sean Avery is a valuable player to any team in the league, idiot or not."
275039,anders,2008-12-03 18:58:00,1168,"GP  G  A   Pts  +/-  PIM Year to date:  2008-09  23  3  7   10  +2    77 On Pace:                     81  10 24 35  +2    271   Those arent stats of someone that is valuable to a team to me.  George Laraque is a type of valuable player, he know is role and place on the team, Avery does not.  he thinks he is a superstar because he pulled a sweet contract!!  He should go back to interning in New York.  He doesnt have a place in the NHL.  Players who play the  ""pest role"" never, ever said things like that. Claude Lemieux, Ciccerelli, those guys were pest and value to a team.  The league also suspends players for racial or derogatory slurs on or off the ice.....this is no different.  The league doesnt hit the nail on the head most of the time, but they are going in the right direction this time."
