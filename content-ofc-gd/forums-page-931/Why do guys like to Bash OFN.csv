276923,fishing n autograph,2008-12-08 02:07:00,2540,hmmm.....  perhaps he has issues with a site that has several intelligent people who are able to do more than just fish and who like to give advice to those who need it......   hmmmm........
276931,tizfun,2008-12-08 02:38:00,292,"Wow !!!!!  Can you believe this person..  I check this board on a daily basis and really appreciate all the posts and comments on here.. They have for me, been informative and helpful and as I've seen for others, supportive and that's what it's all about.. Sure we can talk fish all day, but it's nice to hear others talk about life in general too...  Keep up the great posts everyone !!!!  Tizfun"
276932,ehg,2008-12-08 02:38:00,2666,"Happens every year at this time, little is open and folks get a little stir crazy. Did a post about it couple of years ago. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=1030&hl="
276936,Twocoda,2008-12-08 02:47:00,4130,Well i just went through the fishingreports section on the Longpoint site ...and was wondering what two nuclear reactors  had to do with fishing ...other then the fact that  people that work in that field or live around that area and are members of that site ...obviously love to fish ...isnt that a common bond ??? The long point site is very well moderated and seems to be helpful for many things ( although i never knew it exsisted)... but when and if i do head down to long point in the future for a fishing excurtion ...ill be sure to read more indepthly on thier site to get the lowdown...and will go fishing with the knowlege i aquire  from there as well as here......I wasnt even going to entertain a post in this thread but the shovel comment kinda made me laugh ...because we had two feet of fresh snow fall last night and my snowblower just went on the fritz....  Anybody got a shovel???...preferably with an operator...lol...
276960,Ramble,2008-12-08 03:43:00,713, Yeah that must be it...  -R-
276961,bigugli,2008-12-08 03:47:00,6138, I got one set you can have. It just eats its weight in beer and groceries each week
276966,hammercarp,2008-12-08 04:08:00,964,I went to the other board and clicked on todays posts. There were six of them and two were non fishing. Kinda weird that the guy would post on that site that there's too many NF posts here.
276970,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-08 04:34:00,64,Maybe he just needs to hear the anthem? http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...p;hl=theme+song

I do feel however that singling someone out on this forum to bring negative light upon them is not warranted nor condusive to our community spirit. So in that regard this subject is closed."
276852,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-07 23:50:00,1362,"I've had enough of listening to this individual who consistently bashes OFC!!!!!....Not sure what his anger issue is, but I thought I'd share some of his latest comments from another site and ask your opinion on his comments.....  Is he an ""outcast"" from this site????  "
276854,Greencoachdog,2008-12-07 23:56:00,8163,Bad publicity is better than no publicity at all Steve.

276859,irishfield,2008-12-08 00:04:00,26272,"He can bash all he wants... he's obviously reading daily! So OFC can't be all that bad now can it..... wonder how he enjoyed my concert review!  The only ones that seem to bash OFC are the ""takers""... not the ""givers"" !  BTW Steve.. was he bashing OFC in general or just the fact that YOU directed someone in OFC's direction?"
276860,Joey,2008-12-08 00:04:00,9122,"Ya, I've seen quite a bit of OFC bashing going on on other boards lately, and frankly, it upsets me.  I've met alot of great people here so putting up with a few troublemakers is worth it.  The mods do a fantatic job, one I don't envy, but with the member count, it has to be hard to control everything.  We've already come to the conclusion we like NF posts, so if that guy doesn't want to read them, why bash?  Nothing better to do I suppose.  Joey"
276862,Ramble,2008-12-08 00:12:00,713,"Hey now, It's one thing to put up posts about people bashing, another thing to put up their name, and something different all together to post their picture. This sorta thing is exactly what he's talking about.  He got me the stocking list i was after when no one else here had it. Him and i both belong to other boards, and you have to admit there is some lame-ass posts here from time to time. He doesnt like it, and wants to joke about it...NO PROBLEM. If you have a problem with him you should take it up with him, not make a public post about it. I'm hoping this one gets cut by the mods really soon.  -Dave"
276864,tschirk,2008-12-08 00:14:00,261,"It must be ""fish"" envy. OFC ROCKS! I value it's members and their unabashed opinions. Cheers Ted"
276868,ccmtcanada,2008-12-08 00:16:00,7971,There are other boards???  I barely have time to keep up with this one.
276869,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-08 00:17:00,2038,"No RJ is not a bad Dude ,,The guy knows his stuff no question there,, He does put on some impressive reports every now and then  I think maybe belonging to a ( Boring private site ) might cause him to lurk OFC once in awhile"
276870,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-08 00:18:00,3761,looks like a sens fan to me....
276873,Terry,2008-12-08 00:21:00,14456,"if you can't compete, then bashing is their only hope"
276876,douG,2008-12-08 00:27:00,2693,"Ramble / RJ, and others, too.  Let's all consider this:  Thumper: He doesn't walk very good, does he? Mrs. Rabbit: Thumper! Thumper: Yes, mama? Mrs. Rabbit: What did your father tell you this morning? Thumper: [clears throat] If you can't say something nice... don't say nothing at all.  That was 1942, already, I thought we were through this by now.  Pay attention."
276877,bigugli,2008-12-08 00:29:00,6138,"i would have to agree that posting a person's pic, without consent, would not normally be appropriate.  Have to say I have not heard any one bash OFC.  We all, for the most part, have the ability to pick and choose what we read and don't read. A lot of the NF stuff is a hoot.  As for some of the more colourful personalities I have read about....."
276878,Bernie,2008-12-08 00:31:00,3190,I would take it as somewhat of a compliment. I bet they feel threatened. This is without question the best place to hang out. Yes it's main thing is fishing. But it would be pretty boring if that was all there was to talk about. I love the variety! And you dont need to look all over for stuff like other formats. It's always got something happening too. Rock on OFC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
276880,Marko,2008-12-08 00:34:00,854,Its funny that he complains about it but he knows all about fairly new topics that have been discussed on here. He must be here often enough to know whats going on around here.
276883,douG,2008-12-08 00:41:00,2693,"I think we should have other sub boards where we can discuss all the non fishing topics, like a plumbing board, and a busted car board, and a bird feeder board, and a new arrivals/sudden departures board, and a snow shovel board (for RJ).  Can I hear 'All Right'? [/sarcasm]"
276885,jediangler,2008-12-08 00:45:00,1923,I knew I should have put my old snow shovel in the classifieds section.
276889,LeXXington,2008-12-08 00:53:00,1928,"Its easy to bash OFC becasue its the most active and best..  Not that I am saying anything wrong with other boards but at OFC there is steady chatter fishing/ non-fishing, life etc a Where some boards focus on a type of fishing or location that may be just what you need.  Check out some other boards late November.. wonder how you type the sounds of crickets?"
276893,Leecher,2008-12-08 00:58:00,7832,Well all I have to say is OFC is the best site on the planet.... love this place and lots of good folks with lots of knowledge and if he's bashing us on other sites must be jelousy. Leechman
276897,Mike the Pike,2008-12-08 01:02:00,3421,"Thats OK with me Steve if you posted it.  I think RJ is short for reject,Real Jerk,Rejected Jigger,Ripvan Jerko,   .I wonder how many actual fishing reports are coming in on his sight. Its that time of year too dangerous or difficult to launch a boat. Thankfully we have some Steelhead reports and Simon keeps us entertained with ice fishing reports. Maybe this site is too simple for little RJ  No other site has action like this one, topics move; I guess his sight is so dead he had to talk about this one.  OFC is a close family Mr.Black sheep needs to get a life and"
276899,joonmoon,2008-12-08 01:03:00,528,Tisk tisk....I smell an OFC wanna B...lol. I feel sorry for those that can't be mature and just admit it. Tisk tisk. Maybe someday he will grow up and join the real thing...lol.

276915,jwl,2008-12-08 01:34:00,1056,"as for ""non-fishing reports"" heck in the last few days there been some hardwater reports, some tribin, some musky fishing, some big river trout fishin....posts on gear, boat questions,some questions on tackle and gear selections, some posts about future fishing plans, hunting,cooking......if that ain't fishin and loving the great out doors I don't know what is  , I don't know about much of this ""not fishin stuff"" I manged to squeeze a few reporst in this last couple weeks"
