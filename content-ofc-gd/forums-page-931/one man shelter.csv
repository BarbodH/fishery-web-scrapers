277222,drwxr,2008-12-08 23:35:00,453,just came back from canadian tire and saw this one man shelter that was added to the ice fishing section (never saw it before) only $99 
277226,irishfield,2008-12-08 23:39:00,26272,I think that's the junk that Dan fell over inside of last winter on Temagami... 3 uses and it was  toast.
277229,misfish,2008-12-08 23:43:00,29133,"Just dont get out of yer seat on a windy day.LOL Whoop there it goes.  I am seeing these even for the hunters. Something tells me we can make these. A fold up chair and a quick pop up tent? Yes ,no???????????? For the price I guess you cant beat it. Myself, I would go with a one man flip. Sure it maybe a couple hundred more,but thats the way I would go."
277234,Terry,2008-12-08 23:49:00,14456,I remember that hut with Dano...LOL  but it did fold down nicely....before it broke that is...
277248,paul_614,2008-12-09 00:18:00,168,"I bought the 2 man one last year and have had to do some repairs on it. Like what was said, windy day = stay sitting."
277257,Clampet,2008-12-09 00:27:00,1947," Just how much does ""Dan"" weigh?"
277261,nancur373,2008-12-09 00:32:00,1211,For 100 dollars you could get a nice sized tent and cut a few holes in the bottom.
277263,PERCHER,2008-12-09 00:39:00,787,Save your 100.00 and put it towards one of these new or used you will be glad you did.I bought the guide verson on sale at bps last year.And it was the best money spent when it came to ice fishing equipment. http://www.clamcorp.com/fishtrap_scout.html I think BPS might have them on sale now.

277264,Riparian,2008-12-09 00:42:00,269,"I have the two man version... paid 89 bucks for it.  You get what you pay for... The chair broke first outing. There is very little room to fish. There is small holes in the canopy where the stitching is. The canopy dosent quite hit the ground. It looks like it should be a foot longer.  Anyway its all ive got now so it will have to do. Theres no new ice shelter in the future for me.      Edit: It comes with 4 ""ice screws"" that work pretty good. They anchor the chairs to the ice and hey screw in suprisingly well."
277270,Riparian,2008-12-09 00:50:00,269,Wait... on the plus side theres two beverage holders in it.
277271,paul_614,2008-12-09 00:52:00,168,"The chair was my problem too, that's all fixed. I have been called a turtle while carrying out to my spots."
277273,tbayboy,2008-12-09 00:52:00,1497,"I used one last year and like everyone says, you get what you pay for.  It's better than nothing and is easy to carry around.  If its windy you definitely want to use the ice anchors (the one man onyly came with 2 anchors).  Mine help up over the 10 or so times I took it out last year but if you plan to go out every weekend I'd say your better off spending more money on something a bit more serious (I've upgraded this year).  However if you find one used for a good price than I'd say say go for it - it's better than a bucket out in the open wind.  Here's a quick video I made last year during a really windy day - pretty much pushed it to its limit:  <object width=""445"" height=""364""><param name=""movie"" value="""
277277,drwxr,2008-12-09 01:01:00,453,"im glad i didnt buy it, thanks for all the input. i guess ill invest in a better one."
277285,4thgen,2008-12-09 01:17:00,157,"  I found the Eastman 2-man hut to be well priced and excellent in terms of both durability and ease/quickness of setup. It is light, will fit in the trunk of a car and pops open so there is no assemble. I found the ice screws to be tough to get into black ice so I just throw a cordless drill on the sled for pilot holes. It faced 30km winds and inside, you couldn't tell. It was great for the ~20 trips last season, hopefully it will work well for this season as well."
277293,Clampet,2008-12-09 01:29:00,1947,Here's an alternative fer about $50.00 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2878pKUFxs
277382,douG,2008-12-09 04:47:00,2693,"That was good stuff there, TbayBoy. I almost felt like I was there in the tent too.  Wait a minute, what's that smell?  Jed, I thoroughly enjoyed your journey as you pursued a windbreak that wouldn't blow over.  That was good too.  You're right, if this wind would just STOP, I'd be fine."
277386,bigugli,2008-12-09 05:44:00,6138,"I have the 2 man version. I like the convenience of use, and it is light to carry. Got it as a gift I did not ask for. Wife really surprised me so I can't really complain.  Downsides. Hinge pins for the canopy are cheap. Replaced with good ones. Canopy and back pack use common thread and poorly stitched. Many seams repaired with sailmakers thread and a palm."
