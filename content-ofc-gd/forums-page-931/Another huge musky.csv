276472,irishfield,2008-12-06 22:50:00,26272,A beautiful Mills fish... and a good picture that shows it's length. There is another shot available that shows just how fat she was as well.  Foot and a half of new snow in the last 36 hours here in the buckle of the snow belt. Don't think I can find a usable launch...

275916,johnnyb,2008-12-05 22:18:00,3413,oh no....
275918,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-05 22:23:00,0,Mills knows how to put the big ones in the boat for sure.
275920,Pete Maina,2008-12-05 22:24:00,213,"Good lord. Another monster!  Yep, putting the boat away early"

275927,ohhenrygsr,2008-12-05 22:30:00,947, You and Glen should go giver soon
275937,trapshooter,2008-12-05 22:46:00,1234,that old muskie is a war pig... huge though!
275948,forrest,2008-12-05 23:04:00,1032,I think that fish was caught 3 weeks ago.  How about posting the thread you got it from?
275964,fishindevil,2008-12-05 23:38:00,6254,Awesome fish for sure !!!!
275966,muskeybugged,2008-12-05 23:41:00,282,Wow! Nice fish...... Amazes me how these pigs can still have the speed to feed.  Maybe that's why they seem to be chasing lures going by at only 3-5 mph these last few days.  Great Job angler
275977,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 23:50:00,8163, All fish slow down when the water gets cold... including the bait! The Musky have just as good of a chance to get a meal now as they did in the summer.  The Musky weight calculator puts a 55x28.5 at just a Gnats ass under 56 lbs.
275986,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-05 23:56:00,2038,"Yep , That falls into the '' Serious Beast catergory ''   "
275994,Beats,2008-12-06 00:08:00,543,The fish has a bigger head than the angler.  If only fish could talk..
275996,fishingisliving,2008-12-06 00:13:00,170,"yeah, monster. Jodi knows how to do it!  what a fish!"
276001,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-06 00:22:00,3761,"THATS HUGE, congradulations to the guy who caught that giant. I can only imagine..."
276006,Jigger,2008-12-06 00:33:00,1237,"Oh my...  Hmm, my boats in the garage but these threads are beginning to make her want to see water next weekend...Congratulations again are in order to the lucky angler."
276019,tonka-toy,2008-12-06 00:48:00,139,"Icouldn't agree more,I mean 10 to 15cm of snow and low of minus 11 doesn't sound all that bad.See you out there"
276030,lew,2008-12-06 01:03:00,12767," Were doing a musky trip to the Upper Niagara on the 13th Jigger, why not drag the boat outta the garage & join us"
276058,Jigger,2008-12-06 01:53:00,1237,Thanks for the invite Lew! I was thinking water a little more on the smaller side seeing as I only have a 14 footer. I've seen the pics of the past few trips you guys made at his time of year. Looks like it can get pretty hairy out there! Maybe someone has a spot open? I'm guessing theres a sticky up so I'll check in there.Now I just have to slide it past the warden   .
