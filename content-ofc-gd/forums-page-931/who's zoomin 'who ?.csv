[i'm telling myself]. ok, no explosion, so i grab my gear and head'r out to meet my huntin' buddy. he has had a  similar experince. zip . we're out at the truck now , removing layers of clothing ,, talking, warming up the truck [with performance exhaust],, he asks for the nikons . ""you won't believe""  he says. even in the dieing light we can make out the ouline of a really good doe at about 250 yards ,,,,,,smiling  at us.  we weren't out for more than 20 minutes . where'd she come from?  did we laugh  . even the the most uneventful hunts sometimes turn into memorable ones , as i sit  here scratching my head. i think i was the one being watched.  always great seeing deer , even at a distance.  tomorrow's another day . round two."
