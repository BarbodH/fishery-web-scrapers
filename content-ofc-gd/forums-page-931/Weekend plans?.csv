276810,BillM,2008-12-07 21:09:00,17367,"Brian, I just finished cleaning the driveway.  Its windy as $**$# out there..."
276836,misfish,2008-12-07 22:59:00,29133," Yep,and I get to get up at 4 am Monday to go and blow snow at work so the little people can get to thier machines. Wonder if my last name got me this job.  Brian Blowes,blows snow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Better then some of the things they said back when "
276847,lew,2008-12-07 23:37:00,12767," Jeeez Brian, your missing the best part of the day when you sleep in that late"
275770,BillM,2008-12-05 14:28:00,17367,"I didn't get out last weekend because I had gf duty.  I really don't want to hit the Notty again just to get skunked, I'm starting to hate that river  I am sure a drive to Meaford or Thornbury would be great, but I've never fished the Bighead before so I'd probably just waste my time.  Then there are the Lake O tribs, but if you get more then 4 guys there is no more room. Plus it's a good 2hr drive to anywhere productive from Barrie.  Should I sit at home and drink the bottle of Crown my neighbour brought over lastnight instead?"
275775,fishing n autograph,2008-12-05 14:37:00,2540,drink up! lol....j/k  not sure what you should do. Unfortunately I don't have time to drive to a Lake O trib either. I have to go to my wife's staff xmas party so i'll be dropping by a few of our local trails to snap a few pics. I'm hoping the bald eagles have returned....they winter along the grand river
275786,ketchenany,2008-12-05 14:55:00,3229,"Yup drink the Crown and you'll know exactly what the ""bighead"" is like"
275787,kemper,2008-12-05 15:11:00,2232," drink away bud, its WAY cold out there.  Its alot less fun when you have to chip ice off your float"
275816,huntervasili,2008-12-05 16:30:00,1604,"Way Cold? Sheesh, I am gonna go icefishing on the weekend, lots of ice here now. Ohh wait, nevermind I have Exams Monday, tuesday...etc  Looks like I get to stay home and study! The joys of first ice, and university. My advice, dress up, get on the water, enjoy the day while you still can, then drink the bottle of crown."
275821,huntervasili,2008-12-05 16:49:00,1604,Soon the rivers will be frozen and everything will look like what I got to see this morning 
275824,Leecher,2008-12-05 16:57:00,7832,"Bill, if I was you, I'd try Bighead.  Looks interesting, new body of water to explore and just never know  Then have a few shots of the Crown when you get back Good luck with your decision Leechman"
275845,tibbs,2008-12-05 18:05:00,650,I was just out.  I saw some fish but got skunked.  I'd stay at home if i were you its freezing out there.
275847,jdmls,2008-12-05 18:13:00,575,"Talked to some guys , who were out east this morning... Its stupid cold out there today...Bring out the tire for tomorrow !!!"
275859,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-05 18:43:00,1362,Stay at home and get into that Crown  ...I went out on the river yesterday in my 14'er and lasted 1hr braving the 50km/h winds...I quickly came to my senses and got the hell off the water....today the river has a skim of ice over it...that's it for me for softwater fishing...I'M DONE til next spring!!
275895,johnnyb,2008-12-05 20:54:00,3413,"Goin to work on Saturday...but the bags will be packed, 'cuz on Sunday, we're heading down to Cuba!"
275987,12footspringbok,2008-12-05 23:57:00,459,"Two weeks ago i went down to my favourite hole to burn a few hours. Got there nada no good completly frozen over no other good spots open either. Tried a few drifts under the ice with no luck, time to dust off the ice fishing gear. "
276059,Rustic-Fisher,2008-12-06 01:53:00,826,"Fish,fish,and fish...LOL Always fish around, slush is a pain but worth it on some days. Here's a few of the fish we hooked into today. Froze out there  but managed fish     Good luck"
276060,misfish,2008-12-06 01:58:00,29133,"Hey Bill,if ya got a deer tag and a bow,you can head out with me and Remo in the morning for some venison look,n. We,ll be heading out at 6 am from the park and ride at the Essa/.400.  After that you can come back and have  a shot or two if ya like."
276508,irishfield,2008-12-07 00:16:00,26272,"I decided to do this this weekend Bill...  included some pre-drinking, drinking and post drinking... lol"
276539,KelfuN,2008-12-07 01:34:00,246,bill i hope you didnt hit the eastern lake o tribs.  i checked several creeks today and was it DEAD. total of 2 fish pulled out all day long.
276609,BillM,2008-12-07 05:13:00,17367,"Wasn't dead at all where I was..  First trib was a bust, no flow at all... Second trib was a bust for us, but some other guys were nailing them pretty good.  I think we saw about 6-7 fish out of a single hole.  Berge had a really nice one on, but he had a tackle malfunction and she snapped off.  Had to be smacking them in the face with the bait today for sure...  Anything is better then sitting at home, maybe I'll put some more hours in on the Notty tomorrow."
276611,ctdd2006,2008-12-07 05:19:00,531,but how's the crown???
276613,BillM,2008-12-07 05:26:00,17367,"Just finished watching Manny lay a beating on De La Hoya   Crown is about half empty, lol"
276617,ctdd2006,2008-12-07 05:42:00,531,....you mean De La Hoya's retirement farewell fight???  I think I could have beat him!  I don't think I could've dropped the 80 lbs though for the the weigh in!  Was it worth my $55 plus taxes??? Not sure yet!?
276618,BillM,2008-12-07 05:46:00,17367,De La Hoya should have retired a few years ago.. That fight was an embarrassment.
276755,bbnotty,2008-12-07 18:57:00,93,"Hey Bill, almost went out today but the winds told me to stay in bed. yesterday was sure interesting, would have been nice to see the one that broke me off. we'll do it again when we get a warm spell.  Berge"
276757,jdmls,2008-12-07 19:04:00,575,BillM's new avatar pic...  Maybe the nightmares will stop now  Good to here you boy's got into some. I just didn't have it in me for this weekend
276770,BillM,2008-12-07 19:32:00,17367,"Dave, I heard my avatar was giving you a few sleepless nights, so I decided to change it  :)"
276778,misfish,2008-12-07 19:50:00,29133,"I woke up this morning,heard the wind against the window. Thats all I needed to hear ,for me to stay in and stay with the warm wifie. Not fit for any ""BOW"" hunters today."
