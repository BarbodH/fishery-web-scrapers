I bought a sled this year and would like to find some lakes that are accessible by sled, do some fishing, set up camp, cook your catch and camp out for the night.  Can anyone lead me in the right direction as to where some lakes are accessible by sled.  South of sudbury.  I camp all summer and id be going out with friends, not alone.  thanks"

Making sure you keep your clothes dry in bed  or out is big.  Dry bedding area is also important. We would drag in a few bails of straw as an insulator and dry layer."
