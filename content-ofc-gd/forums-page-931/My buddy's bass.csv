276660,Cudz,2008-12-07 13:58:00,2652,My buddy has a pond on his property in Ohio.  He found this bass floating near the shore.  Looks like he bit off more than he could chew.  My buddy tell me that it was a fairly large bluegill that is stuck in his throat.  
276663,chickenhawk,2008-12-07 14:09:00,612,kinda looks like a walleye with a perch in it's mouth but i can't see it very well....too small of a picture....see if you can post a bigger pic.....either way neat picture!   Hawk
276669,BillM,2008-12-07 14:53:00,17367,"That's definitely not a bluegill, maybe a sucker or something?"
276670,Stoty,2008-12-07 14:55:00,2910,"It's definitely not a walleye.....it's a bass. And BillM is right, doesn't look like a bluegill either."
276672,steverowbotham,2008-12-07 15:14:00,1800,definitely a largie .... but not a bluegill that he munched on

276725,OhioFisherman,2008-12-07 18:01:00,6623,"Also agree with the L/M, not with the Bluegill though, not a very good pic of it though. Sort of unusual most I have seen, even pike tried swallowing it tail first. Fins open and it gets stuck. Soft ray fish chubs shiners and such are better  bait. Fish have adapted to them and know there are no issues eating them."
276730,fishing n autograph,2008-12-07 18:17:00,2540,why are you staring at his buddy's bass???
276743,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-07 18:35:00,3761,That fish has a blue spot on it's tail.
276761,Cudz,2008-12-07 19:13:00,2652,"When I first looked at it I said it was no way a bluegill, too thin but he says it is.  It is 100% a LM though"
