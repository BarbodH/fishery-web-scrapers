277461,Curtis,2008-12-09 15:41:00,83,Me and my father own a private lake. Its already totally covered over but only with about 2 inches i tested it yesturday. I am just hopping that this warm front dosen't destroy what is already frozen.. I cant wait to get out and hunt for some big jumbo perch.  Does anyone know about the haliburton area lakes? They must be getting close to having safe ice..  CT
