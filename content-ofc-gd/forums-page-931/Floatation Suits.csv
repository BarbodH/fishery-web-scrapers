These are the lowest prices I could find on the www.  http://www.kodiakoutback.com/detail.aspx?ID=600  http://stores.implex.net/sailboats/mustang...ms2075-p-2.html  Which one do you think is the better buy?"
276585,douG,2008-12-07 03:30:00,2693,"Those are both fine suits, Glen.  I looked for pfd approval, neoprene cuffs at wrist, zippered ankles AND SUSPENDERS when I bought mine.  The suspenders keep the suit from hanging off yer neck and choking you, and reduce the dreaded bunching thingy.  The Mustang is by far the more better suit, but you get whatcha pays fer, being more spendy and all, but still without the suspenderers."
276639,Greencoachdog,2008-12-07 12:38:00,8163,Does anyone know of any good Canadian web sites that sells these suits?
