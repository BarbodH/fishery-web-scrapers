Anyway....its  1996 Polaris XLT Touring 600....around 4000 on the clock....not a bad deal at $1900...i thought so anyway .   Goin to winnipeg to pick up a frabill/eskimo/clam 3 man sled/shelter next week....should be set to go for ice fishing with a vengeance this year!!!                              BEST THING WAS DRIVING IT HOME FROM KEITHS ACROSS WABIGOON LAKE RIGHT UP MY LAWN!!!  "
276428,Cudz,2008-12-06 21:32:00,2652,good sled.  Stickers might need  a change of colour but it should really serve your purpose well.  No way I could live up there without at least one of those. I really like your property.  Nice.  Must have been a big cahnge from sunny England. My wife is from England as well. You will have a sweet setup when you get your portable hut as well. Look forward to seeing lots of hardwater pics from you.
276451,Grimace,2008-12-06 22:27:00,2020,Nice ride man.   I just picked mine up today as well.    Ice fishing just got a whole lot better.
276476,fishindevil,2008-12-06 22:53:00,6254,"Well you will be all set big time this winter !!!!.  ..you will never want to be inside once you get that portable hut,paired with the machine,look out walleyes !!!!.  ..sure looks like you have a nice place up there,i think we should have an OFC g2g at your place this summer !!!..lol..lol.."
276487,Leecher,2008-12-06 23:10:00,7832,Great sled you bought Simon Hope you don't sink it like your truck J/K  It will be usefull for ya since you have a ton of lakes close to your place Leechman
276493,mistyriver1,2008-12-06 23:16:00,600,"Good stuff Simon, congrats.  I'm dying to give mine a run now."
276501,pike slayer,2008-12-06 23:45:00,1177,not a bad deal for the north. its a polaris so it should last you a long time! its a bit on the heavy side so dont get it stuck! i had my sled out last night and what a blast! i'm just itching to get out on the lake!
276542,Greencoachdog,2008-12-07 01:38:00,8163,"What'd you do, shake hands with a ""sweep""?    Looks like a sweet deal to me!!!"
276557,ctdd2006,2008-12-07 02:14:00,531,"I have the same machine and wouldn't let you have it for 1900!  Keep an eye on your crank though!  I blew mine last year at 5000 miles and ended up nearly putting what you paid for yours to bring her back to shape.  I love it though....but the colour.  My fishing buddies call it the ""purple gay fish slayer""."
276720,limeyangler,2008-12-07 17:46:00,5204,  That would be awesome...got nine acres here...6 acres of land suitable to pitch tents....would give me an excuse to build the dock i keep saying i'll build....lol
276781,Cudz,2008-12-07 20:00:00,2652,Maybe it could be a dock building/fishing G2G
276787,Joey,2008-12-07 20:15:00,9122,"Sweet Ride Simon  We bought a used sled last year for ice fishing and what a difference it made.  We can go pretty much anywhere now.  It helps with the success rate for sure.  Great score, congrats  Joey"
