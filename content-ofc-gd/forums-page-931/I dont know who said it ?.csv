277268,misfish,2008-12-09 00:50:00,29133," Have you seen the lake ? Its still a wee bit soft out there. I did hear a rumor that Little has a crust started. I may just venture out during the Christmas break for an eye or crappie. Then again maybe ST.John may also be good to go.  YES YES YES,I will be heading out."

277373,Cudz,2008-12-09 04:19:00,2652,It has been frozen for about 2 weeks. I drive past it everyday.  Orr lake has been frozen for the same amount of time as well.
