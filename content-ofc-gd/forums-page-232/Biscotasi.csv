I hung around the lodge checking things out. Things are finally warming and the flowers finally starting to show.   A little solo fishing .  When they got  back, there was a healthy number of pike for me to clean   The gang with their guide.  Back to more fish in the evening to put more bucktails to the test.   Rob would use the same spinnerbait all week.  Tuesday morning we headed out on our own for a 1 hour run past Grey Owl island to hit a walleye flat with some great results.  Lots of double headers     My Quasimodo walleye with a big face tumor  Then we hit a nice shallow bay for pike in the afternoon.   Our end tally  That evening we went and scouted a few more spots. We found that the bait of choice was leeches. and the walleye preferred them baited on a minnow head, instead of a ball jig.   The next day, would again be about walleye"
