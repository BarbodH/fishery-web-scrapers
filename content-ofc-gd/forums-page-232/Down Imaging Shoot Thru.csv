857807,Pitta,2014-06-12 02:23:00,1,I just purchased a Lowrance Elite 4x HDI and I wanted to know if the down imaging will work if I mount the transducer on the inside of the boat as a shoot thru method.  I'm sure the other aspects of the device will work but will the down imaging work?  thanks for the help
857827,porkpie,2014-06-12 07:31:00,2521,"I have been told it will not.  I have a spare transducer for my Humminbird, and thought about mounting it as a shoot through on my kayak.  What info I have found says it won't work.  I could be wrong, but I am sure a call to lowrance will sort that out."
857832,lookinforwalleye,2014-06-12 11:03:00,4399,"Read the manual...."" the DSI transducer can be epoxied to the hull for shoot thru applications. This is not a recommended method as it seriously degrades DSI performance""  Page 17"
857839,aplumma,2014-06-12 11:35:00,6896,I would not do it but if you want to try it before you epoxie it into place put the transducer into a plastic bag full of water and put it in the location you think you want to put it in. Make sure there is no air bubbles between the hull and the bag and this will give you a true reading of what it will show you after shooting thru the hull.    Art
