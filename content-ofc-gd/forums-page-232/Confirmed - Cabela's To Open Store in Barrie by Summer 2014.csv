Those stores are good when you can't find the product elsewhere or you want to give family members a list of gift ideas. LOL The local stores are in and out for what I need, not buying a bunch of stuff because it's in my face. American companies coming to Canada is only good if we get their prices."

Two major American retailers have targeted Park Place in their scopes for two new stores. Target Canada will put shovels in the ground this fall to build a 127,000-square-foot department store with plans to open August 2014. And Cabela's, a large hunting, fishing and camping American retailer has inked a deal that will see them digging a 70,000-square foot foundation this fall for a spring 2014 opening. “We're really excited, this is really going to flesh this thing out and get the whole area up and going,” said Terry Coughlin, managing partner of the North American Development Group that has been patiently bringing retailers to Barrie's south-end since 2010. Cabela's opened in 1961 and now has 45 stores across the U.S. including three stores in Western Canada in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Saskatoon. The large fishing and outdoor gear retailer will offer about 200 jobs in Barrie. “Thanks to the loyalty of our thousands of Canadian customers, and especially those across the province of Ontario, it was an easy decision to bring the Cabela’s retail experience to Barrie,” said Tommy Millner, Cabela’s chief executive officer. “I can’t say enough about Canada. It’s a Cabela’s kind of place.” Target Canada's big box store, slated to open next summer and employ several hundred people is its first build in Canada. Its initial foray into Canada saw 120 Zellers stores converted into the American name-brand retailer that opened earlier this year. Target says they plan to open approximately 200 stores in Canada within the next 10 years. Coughlin says there are 200,000 square feet of stores currently open, and Phase II – of which Target is the mainstay – will offer as many square feet, however several smaller stores are planned for the periphery. “Next summer, you'll see it start looking full,” he said. Originally the Molson Park lands, the 195-acres of Park Place faced severe opposition by Barrie city council in 2002 when it was initially proposed and ended up at an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) hearing. Park Place received OMB approval to begin building in October 2006 and plowed through the recession with contracts signed by Bed Bath and Beyond, Best Buy, Marshall's, a Future Shop (that has since closed), as well as several large restaurants including the Lone Star Texas Grill and Milestones. An LA Fitness club is currently under construction and slated to open later this fall. Although the majority of jobs in Barrie's south end will be at the lower end of the wage scale, Coughlin believes they are still viable employment opportunities. “At the Lone Star, they hired 150 people, but there were 1,500 applicants,"" he said. ""So, anybody saying we don't need those jobs, tell that to the people who applied.”  [email protected] Twitter.com/cherylbrowne1"

800048,rob v,2013-07-25 13:04:00,535,great news !
800049,BillM,2013-07-25 13:06:00,17367,"Let me guess... they'll put this at Park Place and make traffic a million times worse, lol!  I can't figure out how a city with only 130,000 people has such a traffic problem.   There are some civil engineers that need to lose their jobs in this town.   It's unreal at times (Essa/Ardagh/400/Little intersection is a great example)"
800053,Fisherman,2013-07-25 13:21:00,7201,"Yes, there's a bunch of numpties for sure that designed the Moson Pk/400 interchange.  They should have put the off/on ramp behind Costco to come out at the next lights east,  there's far too many unsynchrinized lights there.  Same with that cluster at the bottom of Essa, should have the off ramp run into Little and then close the rest of it, one less light to cause delays.   I'm waiting for the the 400/Duckworth replacement, that'll be something to see."
800054,wkimwes,2013-07-25 13:21:00,76,"Nice, finally another choice. Maybe this news will spark some better service and prices with BPS."
800055,BillM,2013-07-25 13:31:00,17367," Me and Chris (Cudz) were discussing this a few weeks ago..  Ardagh should have run right under the highway into Little (It's a straight shot)..  it would have bypassed that entire clusterfub at Essa/400 right now.  I can't imagine what the Duckworth/400 upgrade is going to be like, lol!  Luckily I don't go near that (If I need to get on 90, I just run down to 27)"

800065,BillM,2013-07-25 14:10:00,17367, That would relieve so much traffic at the Essa/400 intersection..    Maybe the new Cabelas will be going where Molsens used to be?

800068,LeXXington,2013-07-25 14:33:00,1928,IT's GREAT news!  I just hope they adjust the pricing unlike another major competitor  Can’t understand the logic if I can order from the US and get it delivered to my door cheaper than driving 20K away and buying it.  Watched a family get in a argument with a sales person… “but sir we can get it from your store online and have it delivered cheaper than its listed here” the response was sorry please order from the online store? nothing we can do.
800069,Fang,2013-07-25 14:34:00,1330,This will add 2-3 hours to the drive to temagami
800071,BillM,2013-07-25 14:35:00,17367,If you go in looking for that deal you'll get an argument every single time...   Everything is more expensive here for the most part... If you can get it cheaper there after taxes/duty/shipping then order it online.  Stop hounding the part time salesmen about corporate pricing structure.
800072,bare foot wader,2013-07-25 14:43:00,1354,"well if the store is anything like the edmonton and saskatoon stores you're in for a disappointment....I order online all the time, but won't step foot in their stores....we get the ""canadian downsized version""....poor selection and insane markups"

800078,BucktownAngler,2013-07-25 15:03:00,582,its good to have competition. but if its pricing is the same as cabelas.ca i wont be shopping there
800080,kickingfrog,2013-07-25 15:19:00,8333,Oh no. At least with the others a 40 minute drive away I could resist a little.  I guess this is how my wife feels when a new mall is announced.
800082,kickingfrog,2013-07-25 15:35:00,8333,There are a few reasons. The bay in the middle of the city doesn't help much to start and the city was the fastest growing in the 80's and still is one of the fastest leads to a planning nightmare that the city never has properly  been able to manage.
800088,BillM,2013-07-25 16:19:00,17367,"I think a distinct lack of common sense is probably the best answer, lol."
