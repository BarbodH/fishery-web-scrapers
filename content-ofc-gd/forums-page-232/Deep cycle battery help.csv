857676,glen,2014-06-11 16:27:00,2641,My one year old deep cycle is bubbling when it is unhooked from everything. It has about a teaspoon worth of electrolyte on the top leaking out of the vent caps. What's wrong with this battery.
857691,NANUK,2014-06-11 18:03:00,797,"Try cleaning the cables/connectors and battery terminals, make sure all connections are tight. Check water levels, should be just below the neck of each vent hole. Make sure you use face protection. Boiling is usually caused by over charging or a slight short, I have a feeling you need a new battery."
857697,glen,2014-06-11 18:18:00,2641,It's not connected to anything. Small short inside the battery? Thanks for your help.
