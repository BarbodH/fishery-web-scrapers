857886,adempsey,2014-06-12 16:17:00,1498,"I am sure you can get cheap ""truely"" polarized glasses with 100% UV.   The $20 sunglasses I bought at BPS seem just fine to me, although I cannot test to UV protection myself.   You can test the polarization in the store by putting two pairs of sunglasses together at 90 degree angles, much like in that video with the monitor posted above.  The differences are going to be in the quality of the optics, not necessarily the polarization & protection.  You will likely [hopefully] get increased clarity and better color with more expensive lenses.    So, you have to gauge if that is important enough to spend 10x the $.  For myself, it's not.  However, I don't sight fish either.   If I did, I'd probably invest in a better pair of shades."
857978,Sharkbait22,2014-06-12 22:44:00,297,I've had Smith photochromatic brownish tint and polarized glasses that were great but heavy. My understanding is that Smith can be difficult to work with on warranty and repairs. Rapala ones from CTC were ok for $20 buck but the fell apart after a year and one pair had a noticeable distortion. I've had Maui Jims for the last four years in prescription and they are the best so far. Not cheap but with the prescription I never have them off my head unless my regular glasses are on - in which case they are in the sturdy case they provide. Maui Jims seem to have exceptional polarization (all their glasses - not an option). So much so that they get get by with less tint to block out sun. I can were mine in really low light or on sunny days.  A stereo is only as good as your ears or the room and the same goes for glasses.  Some percentage of people need glasses but don't wear them so why buy $$ glasses.

Make sure you get the right colour for what you typically fish or at least 1 amber based colour and 1 grey based colour.  Google search should tell you the rest."
858119,FrankTheRabbit,2014-06-13 15:14:00,479,"Went on a deep sea fishing charter in Miami last year and the guide swears by his Abu Garcia polarized glasses. Granted, they were $350 a pair so I can see why he would! I tried them on and couldn't tell much of a difference with my $25 pair of H2Optics. But I think it was more of my lack of knowledge in knowing the differences between my pair and his. Just like how some people might not appreciate the difference between a Stradic and a Stella."

For fishing those that won't spend the $ can get by, it's not a make or break kind of deal. But my son and I also shoot skeet and trap. We use the same glasses as for fishing but with diff col lenses for diff days and col. Would never trust cheapie stuff for that, ever. $ does buy you better clarity, quality and safety"

The bottom line is: if you do a lot of sight fishing investing in a good pair of sunglasses is worth it. I know that I have tried $50 sunglasses and they pale in comparison to better ones. These are the cheapest ones that I own that work. They also have the advantage of having interchangeable lenses for different light conditions."
857681,Walleye72,2014-06-11 16:36:00,156,"I got a pair that I like at Mountain Equipment Co-op.  They are Sun Cloud, and they are polarized.  http://www.mec.ca/product/5028-295/suncloud-hook-polarized-sunglasses-unisex/?q=suncloud%2Bhook  I like the amount of light that they block due to the style of the frames.  They are similar to the cheaper ($20) pair of Rapala glasses that I previously owned.  It seems to me after having worn both pairs, that the clarity of the lenses in the Sunclouds is better than the Rapalas.  Down the road I might consider a more expensive pair, but right now I like these.  And I don't have to worry about losing a $200 pair of glasses while I fish.  One last thing.  Be wary of buying online without having tried them on.  It was amazing how important trying on all the different options at MEC was.  Many of the glasses that I viewed on the website were not comfortable on me at all.   I am grateful I didn't order the pair I thought ""looked the best"" on the site as they felt awful.  Lesson learned."

The UV protection is amazing, I've had sun burn on my face except where my glasses are.  so yes, you can get great glasses on the cheap, but hard to find.

Copper is a good universal colour for tea stained water.  Green for green or clear water (you'll see a lot of ocean guys wearing green/blue costas). - Dark grey is best for brightest days, but sucks when it's not.  You can get polarchromic lenses which darken with brightness and visa versa.  I have this in mine, though not sure how well it works."

857871,aero_ball,2014-06-12 15:13:00,19,"I have used glasses with MSRP under $30 and over $200, from my experience you ""somewhat"" get what you paid for.  What I mean is that, first off, the more expensive sunglasses usually have higher markups, so if you're buying a pair at MSRP then it's likely overpriced. However if you get it at a discount the performance enhancement would usally worth the extra money spent.  I can't really comment on UV protection but regarding polarizing performance, some (not all) of my budget sunglasses are less than desirable to say the least. I've had ones that the lenses were not cut at the correct polarizing angle so I'll have to tilt my head to one side for maximum glare cut-out. Worse yet I've had budget glasses in which the left and right lenses were cut at different polarizing angles. So not only does it make it impossible to get maximum glare cut-out, I would actaully feel dizzy after wearing it for any prolonged period.  Secondly, many of the higher end sunglasses have a more sturdy / quality built. I know when it goes down the drink the $200 ones sinks pretty much just as fast as the $20 ones. However, quality does come into play. For example, many of the screws on the budget glasses were mounted directly onto the plastic frame. Depending on how the users treat their sunglasses and how much ""mileage"" you put on them, the threads could wear out quickly. I've had to glue some of the budget glasses solid, while the metal threads on the more costly ones work year after year. And if I can't fold a pair of sunglasses and put it in a case it's a matter of when it gets crushed and decomissioned.  Regarding optical performance, from personal experience, the clarity of higher end sunglasses are better than budget ones in general. My take is that if you're getting a pair that's $100+ then the quality is usually there. If you're getting a budget pair then you've got to weed out the bad ones. Of course you might find a hidden gem along the way. That said some of the glass lenses that come with more expensive pairs have supreb optical performance. It's heavier and breakable but if you want more clarity then I found that's the way to go.  I love my pair of Maui Jim in grey from Costco (around $100). It's got glass lenses and one feature that I really liked personally is the gradation they put on the lenses. The top and bottom parts of the lens were darker and the middle band is lighter. I found it exceptional cuz it cuts out the light from the sky as well as the glare from closest to the boat. At the same time it leaves the area straight ahead more visible with the lighter shade.  Color wise I use an amber/copper pair during low light and a grey pair when it's bright. Much like how I use seperate combos for drop shottin' and flippin'. Just my 2 cents."
