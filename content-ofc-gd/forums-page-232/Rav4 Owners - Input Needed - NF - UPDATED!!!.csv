841917,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-18 21:25:00,2582, My wife has this notion that sitting a bit higher up is safer for some reason... (not that a few inches make a difference) And the Foresters sit a bit low for her..  It's all in her head.  I'm afraid she has a point and insurance companies agree with her.  Last year I traded in a 2002 VW Golf for my 2013 Sante Fe.  If you asked me I would say the 2002 VW is a more solid better built car. My insurance dropped nearly $150 a year.  I thought they had made a mistake and questioned it. They said it was because  a higher built car was considered more safe. Never in a million years would I have thought a brand new car would be cheaper to insure then an 11 year old one.

842504,FrankTheRabbit,2014-03-21 16:29:00,479,"Coming off of a company lease on a 2011 Rav4 base w/AWD. Racked up 87,000km from Nov 2011 and it's been a great vehicle for all seasons, especially during winter. Not bad on gas...I got about 9.0-9.7L/100km on highway driving and would get around 11-12L/100km city driving. No major problems, but regular maintenance was done at the dealership. Some of my favorite features were the front windshield defroster, sliding & reclining rear seats, and being able to drop the rear seats for extra storage from the back. Some things I didn't like were the seats (they are OK, but got tired tushes on long distance drives), the audio system, and the swinging rear latch.For the new vehicle, we narrowed it down to three 2014 choices: Forester, Tiguan, and Rav4.Tiguan was small, but had a comfy ride and required premium fuel. Great features for the Trendline w/4Motion. Heated front seats, fog lights, good rear seating space even with the front seats fully extended.Forester was great all around. Quiet and confident drive. Lots of features with the 2.5i Convenience pkg. Has a ground clearance of 8.7"", which is higher than the Rav4 (6.3"") and Tiguan (6.9""). Their asymmetrical AWD system is legendary, great fuel economy with their CVT (slightly better than the 2014 Rav4), and huge trunk space 2115L with seats folded down. A nice feature to have is their Xmode, which also includes hill descent control with their CVT transmission.Rav4 was a nice surprise. Compared to the 2011, it drove more like a car. The ride comfort was noticeably improved and cabin noise was also reduced. Highway driving can yield over 600km per tank, which is improved over our current model. Lots of features as well and their sound system has been much improved over our current Rav4.We have narrowed it down to the Rav4 and Forester. It's difficult to ignore the reliability and service of Toyota, but the ride height of the Forester and its solid AWD might be the deciding factors for us."
842509,NAW,2014-03-21 17:03:00,4022,"Thanks for the write up!  Those are some good details, I appreciate it!  I was at the toyota dealership today looking at some.  they also have a used forester there which I am going to test drive."
842518,BillM,2014-03-21 17:53:00,17367,"CVT would kill it for me on the Subaru, those transmissions take any fun out of low HP motors."
842527,FrankTheRabbit,2014-03-21 18:16:00,479,"Anytime NAW. There's so many little details that I'm leaving out between all three vehicles. I felt all three vehicles had excellent visibility all around. I've had a 2009 Dodge Journey and that had terrible blind spots, so I'm basing my experience on that vehicle.  One other interesting little thing I found on the 2014 Forester. There are these side panels, at the bottom of the doors, that flare out and run to the bottom of the chassis. The idea behind them is so any kind of mud/dirt/snow/rain/etc will run down and drip away from the frame so you won't get your pants dirty. I thought that was a small, but clever feature.  Let us know what you think of your test driveâ€¦maybe I missed out on some things too."
842529,FrankTheRabbit,2014-03-21 18:19:00,479,"CVT would kill it for me on the Subaru, those transmissions take any fun out of low HP motors.  Don't have any prior experience with this current CVT, but from what I've heard, they're kinda sloppy or feels like a rubber band? I think it has been redesigned from the previous model and it does provide better fuel economy compared to their manual transmission counterpart. Not perfect by any means, but at least there is a benefit in that regard. The 2.5L NA puts out 170hp and their 2.0L turbo puts out 250hp (has a modified CVT to handle the increased torque demands). On our test drive (the 2.5L version), it seemed fine. Granted, it was just a regular road & highway test, with short bursts on the accelerator. So anything beyond that, I wouldn't know how good or bad it is."
842557,Big Cliff,2014-03-21 21:58:00,6899,"Just a little thing and doesn't make much difference in the operation of the car but: A couple of years agoI was doing some sales/marketing work for a coffee supplier. I had talked to quite a few car dealerships as part of our program. Most of them were interested in providing coffee and tea for their waiting rooms but the Subaru dealer in Peterborough insisted right off the bat that he wanted the best for his customers because they deserved it!  We talked for a while about what system would supply the quality and variety he wanted for his customers and he decided on a single serve system. His cost per cup was almost tripple what most of the dealerships wanted but as he explained: They buy the best, they deserve the best!  That statement alone made me think that If I could afford it my next car would be a Subaru. For a variety of reasons I did opt for a Nissan but I really wish I hadn't!"

857820,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-12 03:49:00,10439,Here's a Subaru warning for you. One of my employees had two of them that they bought at the same time. An SUV for the wife and a WRX for him. There is no dealer here so all of their oil changes and other maintenance was done by one of the other dealers in town. They made the mistake of not keeping every receipt for said maintenance. Unfortunately  both vehicles had engine issues not sure what the issue with his was but hers had a defective timing belt that broke well within the warranty period. Because they didn't have service receipts Subaru Canada denied warranty on both vehicles. They instantly traded in both vehicles on new ones that were not Subaru and vow to never ever purchase another and tell everyone contemplating it not to.

841325,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-15 02:44:00,2582,"As per Rattletrap2's comments. My 2013 Sante Fe gets between 7.9 and 9 Km per litre in the summer when we are going to the cottage every weekend...so lots of highway driving.  This winter the mileage is worse as we are doing almost no highway driving. So I would say highway only is between 7.9-8.3L/100KM. City is over 10.

They even provided me with an upgraded fully loaded truck for the seven weeks mine was laid up while they changed the engine and also gave me back my lease payments for the seven weeks. Once the engine was changed out, there were never any other problems.  With this Rogue about the only thing I keep hearing is ""that's just the way it is""!  They will fix the tailgate under warranty but it is a new car, it shouldn't have to be fixed already and they will fix what I can see but what about the stuff I can't see right now. (they have also said they would talk to the body shop about having the front spoiler plastic welded when the tailgate is being done for a a fee of course)  They have offered to disconnect the sport mode switch but that doesn't solve the problem of it being very poorly desigined. You pay for it, it's no good so they disconnect it?"

The XT (turbo 2.5L) if you can find one in your budget would be a great vehicle. All the boxer engines can develop head gasket problems as they get older and especially if they are not properly maintained. Besides a bad gasket material choice which seems to have been remedied in the early 2000s they are also prone to improper coolant types and change intervals and it would seem ethanol doesn't help (the turbos take premium so you don't hear about them having as many problems). They AWD system is great! with the recent snow fall where everyone was getting stuck I was able to plow through everything with my snowies on. As others have mentioned I think they went a bit to generic in exterior styling on their 2014 update, all the small-mid SUVs are starting to look the same anymore, Hyndai, Honda, Subaru etc. they all have similar body lines.

It is roomy and great to drive.  She doesn't tow or take it off road.  It handles Toronto snow conditions.  We live at the bottom of a hill on a cul-de-sac; so we often have to drive up an unploughed hill after it snows.  It handles that well; but this is Toronto snow, not Barrie snow.  It also provides good ground clearance.  It doesn't bottom out on our drive way; some minivans do.  It also provides a good amount of interior space for the size of the vehicle.  We have never tried it in snow belt conditions.  The one thing that I do not like about it is the adjustment for the drivers seat.  I am 6' 4"" and my wife is not.  In addition to sliding the seat all the way back; I have to pump a lever to tilt the whole seat back to give me more room.  Then I have to adjust the angle of the back of the seat to compensate for tilting the entire seat.  Then my wife has to the opposite when she drives.  It's a bit of a pain to adjust between our heights.  If the seat would just slide back an extra couple of inches it would eliminate all of the other adjustments."

As stated above if your a big person (I'm 6'4"" 275lbs...) it's not roomy by any means... But I can get in and out find and sit fairly comfortably..."
841155,adempsey,2014-03-14 04:10:00,1498,"I leased a 2009 RAV4 for 4 years.  Great car, NEVER an issue.   It has the most room of all compact SUVs as far as I know.  After my lease was up,  I purchased a 2014 Mazda CX-5 (last June).  Great car as well.  Almost picked up a 2014 Subaru Forester instead, but opted for the CX-5 because it was more stylish.  I test drove every single compact SUV on the Canadian market (at least I think I did!).  I left Toyota for reasons not related to car quality.   I also really disliked the look and feel of the new RAV4, but loved my 2009 RAV4.  If I were shopping used, I'd be looking at the RAV4, CR-V and Forester for sure.  Probably look out for some of the higher end brands as well, like Acura MDX and Volvo.XC60."
841185,aplumma,2014-03-14 12:01:00,6896,I would look at the forester if there is a dealer in the area. Great cars and lots of value for the dollar.   Art

841190,NAW,2014-03-14 12:13:00,4022,Thanks for the info so far.  You guys pretty much are confirming what I thought to be true.  I've heard the subaru's can be hit more miss for quality.  But obviously great for driving.  My wife was looking at Nissan Rogue..  But I haven't heard much good things about them...  I notice they haven't been mentioned in this thread yet..
841191,Rod Caster,2014-03-14 12:24:00,5784,Rav-4 or the Soob are good vehicles based on my anecdotal evidence and reading . Don't get the Nissan.  Agreed with whoever said the forester and the new Rav are UGLY.  My dad has an older equinox and its a terrible vehicle.

841205,Raf,2014-03-14 14:11:00,3495,"get a jeep.  rav4s are fantastic vehicles, my mom drove one for years till it was totalled when she was rear ended.  very reliable vehicle and she loved it.  she replaced it with a 2013 forrester."
841211,Big Cliff,2014-03-14 15:15:00,6899,"I have a Rogue and I am not the least bit happy with it:  The back up sensors on it are a joke (they are actually pointed up in the air rather than down behind you and even when they do work, you can't hear them)  I have had my air bag light come on but they can't figure out why (they said it must be weather related but they don't know, that is very rearasuring)  I don't find the seats comfortable for long trips, they are hard and boxey  The ""sport mode"" switch is located right beside the drivers seat so if you are wearing a coat you are constantly putting it into sport mode which is harder on fuel but does little else for you  My car is only 4 months old and already there are rust bubbles coming through the paint on the tail gate  I get 460 km for the first half a tank of gas and less than 100 km before the empty warning light comes on, clearly the fuel gauge isn't calibrated properly but as with so many other things with this car, ""that's just the way it is!"".  You are not supposed to be able to lock yourself out of the car while the key is in the ignition, yup, 4 times so far when I talked to the dealership about it they told me that it happens so often now the techs even put the window down on the car when they are working on it. (Not good when you are trying to warm the car up on a cold winter morning).  The first time I took Sue out on the highway with it she kept checking to see if the one of the windows was open because of the wind/road noise, her Toyota is much quieter.  Start the car on a cold winter morning and you'll think you have a deisel, even sitting in the car you have to turn the radio up to hear it over the valve clatter.  In Jan. I went through a snow drift coming in our road, my neighbor had been through it 20 minutes before me with his Honda, Sue drove through it about 10 minutes before with her Toyot, as I went through it I herd a snap sound, when I got home I checked and the spoiler had a crack in it from the top down, I showed it to the dealer and their comment was that ""well this is a much colder winter than normal""  Wait a minute, the Honda and Toyota which are both smaller than my Rogue didn't have any damage to them and there is no impact mark or anything so I didn't hit a chunk of ice or anything.  I have been driving Nissans for 12 years now and was always very satisified but based on my experience with this one it will be my last.  I have even requested a meeting with Nissan regarding the issues with it, that was three weeks ago and as of this morning they have not responded or even acknowledged my request so if you are thinking a Rogue you might want to consider my experience!"
841215,NAW,2014-03-14 15:31:00,4022,Dang cliff.  Nuf said.  I will let my wife read this post and it will change her mind for sure!!!  Sorry about your luck!!

Doubt you'll find someone that owns one and isn't happy with it.... Hyundai has come a loooong way.... X2 for the Sante Fe. Really really happy with mine. Love the extra room and gets about 550-650KM per tank. I must add that it is only 1 year old though..so I can't comment on how well they stand the test of time. I know several people who own them and all are happy. The other Plus for me anyway is the dealership has been 100% great to deal with. Debbe drives a 2005 Accent so we have been dealing with them since 2005. I see lots of Santa Fe's on the lot that aren't very old and are well within your price range."
841230,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-14 16:21:00,826,"Picked up a Subaru Forester last year. Traded in my jeep Rubicon for it :-( . Honestly , it's been a great vehicle thus far. With a set of high end winter tires and the all wheel drive system the little beast feels unstoppable in cruddy snow conditions . I'm reaching for the Subaru keys over  the Dodge Ram Megacab  keys 9/10 times and not just due to fuel. Not to impressed with the dealership though, but that's another can of worms."

You must have a decent track of every attempt you made to have the vehicle fixed and the outcome,  time/date is excellent, who you spoke to, any paper trail such as the work orders, etc.  When he submitted his case, he had all his ""ducks in a row"",  the arbitrator was amazed and the Nissan rep just sat there dumbfounded.  He only lost a small amount for the 5 month period."
841291,NAW,2014-03-15 00:05:00,4022,Thanks for all the info everyone!  I called my buddy who is a service manager at a Hyundai dealership.  He agreed that the Santa Fe is a great vehicle.  He also said the older v6 Tucson is the best vehicle Hyundai ever made.  So I'll be checking them out as well.  So the list has been narrowed.  Thanks to OFC.   Rav4 Santa Fe Tucson CRV Forester  Time to start test driving!!!
841300,tbayboy,2014-03-15 01:42:00,1497,"I'm driving a 2007 V6 Rav 4 sport and love it. 180K, no problems at all (not lots of miles for its age so take it with a grain of salt). Lots of interior space but the right size overall for living in the city (and easy to hoist the kayak onto the roof). The V6 has plenty of ooomph - I really love that part.  Haven't towed with it yet but its seen some rough roads up in the temiskaming  (yeah I cant spell) area without a problem.  The new ones worry me though - no more V6 and they moved the spare from the back to underneath which is a pain in the *ss but thats just my opinion I guess."
