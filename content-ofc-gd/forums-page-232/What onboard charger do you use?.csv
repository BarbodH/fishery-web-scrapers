857318,Handlebarz,2014-06-09 19:36:00,3790,I need a new charger I remember reading here about other chargers but can not remember what the other brand was that most liked.  What are you using?
857321,lew,2014-06-09 19:59:00,12766,"Get yourself a Guest charger Mike, their excellent."
857322,Roy,2014-06-09 20:02:00,13728,"Another vote for Guest here, Mike."
857325,Handlebarz,2014-06-09 20:33:00,3790,That was the name I was confused as CTC has Genius ones I did not think that was the name. What places have the best prices? Thanks guys
857326,Terry,2014-06-09 20:34:00,14456,I had guest for years sold it when I sold the boat and bought a cheaper make wish I bought a guest
857328,Handlebarz,2014-06-09 20:49:00,3790,I can only find them online and my local store does not have them listed in their books and have not heard of them. I guess I am buying online
857329,lew,2014-06-09 20:58:00,12766,The last Guest I bought was back in '99 Mike and I got it from West Marine in Toronto but I have no idea if they still carry them or even if they'd ship you one.
857330,Roy,2014-06-09 21:03:00,13728,"Got mine from Cabela's, Mike.  I had to get mine online but you probably get down there from time to time ? Mine is model 2611."
857338,Handlebarz,2014-06-09 21:32:00,3790,Ok thanks guys I will look at both of them
857354,Ron,2014-06-09 22:08:00,1683,"Guest is the answer. I bought mine at BPS a few years back. It finally calfed and had to buy another one as well. BPS no longer carrys Guest now=bummer.

857356,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-09 22:13:00,10439,I have the Nautilus three bank from CT. It's made by Schumacher Electric and re-branded with the Nautilus brand. Comes with a 5 year warranty. Had an issue with a fan in mine in year 4 and got a replacement no questions asked. I'm pretty sure the NOCO Genius is the replacement for it. It also carries a 5 year warranty.
857378,wdodgetruck,2014-06-09 23:53:00,27,I have been using a Bass Pro brand for 4 years without a problem . The Bass pro charger are Pro Mariners.
857437,Cosmos,2014-06-10 12:12:00,588,MinnKota is a charger in my boat.
857589,Pigeontroller,2014-06-11 00:40:00,2793,"Here's what I'm using Mike, worked well now for 4 years...On sale too!  http://www.basspro.com/ProMariner-ProSport-Series-Onboard-Marine-Battery-Chargers/product/97825/"
857623,Gerry,2014-06-11 05:12:00,257,My 2006 Ranger came with a 4 bank Dual Pro. Prior to the Ranger I had a Triton and it came with a Dual Pro.....had that boat for 6+ years. And before the Triton I had a Lund ProV and it also had a Dual pro. That one was replaced free when something went wrong with it after 4 years of use.
857686,fish_fishburn,2014-06-11 17:25:00,1311,Dual Pro are the best on the market. Mine is 15 yrs old and still works awesome. Might be why I get at least 5-7 yrs out of all my batteries.
857702,grimsbylander,2014-06-11 18:32:00,3016,I need a 4 bank for my boat...guess I'll be shopping for a Dual Pro as well.
857829,RangerGuy,2014-06-12 09:38:00,564,"Guest gets my vote, have owned 2 and neither has failed. First one was 7yrs old when I sold the boat."
