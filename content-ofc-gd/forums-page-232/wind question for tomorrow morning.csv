858174,iFish4real,2014-06-13 21:24:00,386,Hey! How 20km/h NW wind would be for my 14' deep Lund tomorrow at Port Burwell? Advice appreciated.  
858175,misfish,2014-06-13 21:29:00,29133,"It,s an easy thing here for me.  Wadding creeks with the fly rod and spin.  Not even thinking of taking the float tube out anywhere.  Dont let me down weather (dick) man  ."
858181,spincast,2014-06-13 21:44:00,3279,"hmm I would think somewhere between uncomfortable and wet might be descriptive. Of course,  you might also be uncomfortably wet?. But My experience on E is somewhat limited. 15 K on O was my comfort zone for solo fishing  in the 16 foot dual console."

But My experience on E is somewhat limited. 15 K on O was my comfort zone for solo fishing  in the 16 foot dual console. 15 kms  is my comfort zone as well.The boat does well in even heavier winds but not comfortable at all,fishing . I think 20km winds ifish4real would be far to much IMO."
858224,bushart,2014-06-13 23:07:00,2628,Not Me--maybe Sunday---it's the gusts
858237,misfish,2014-06-13 23:30:00,29133,Not Me--maybe Sunday---it's the gusts  Not on the streams.
858241,davey buoy,2014-06-13 23:35:00,5505,Sunday's showing 10km right now.That is doable.Will have to wait and see.
858246,misfish,2014-06-14 00:10:00,29133,Sunday's showing 10km right now.That is doable.Will have to wait and see.  Thats tube a do for me.
858284,i2cool2fool,2014-06-14 03:33:00,349,I think I'll be playing it safe and cutting the grass tomorrow.
858304,Fisherman,2014-06-14 12:10:00,7201,"Hmm,  25 gusting to 36, that could put a fine chop on the water."
858317,esoxansteel,2014-06-14 13:45:00,1307,"I was out on Rice, and jiggin on my knees on the front deck a week ago, with the west wind and 3 1/2 footers for 2 days straight, knee pads came in handy, big chop for sure, follow Brian on the creeks"
858322,iFish4real,2014-06-14 14:31:00,386,"thank you all! we didn't go in the morning, thought it was wiser not to we're trying the afternoon, wind supposed to die down to 12km/h"
858333,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-14 15:43:00,8243,"As a resident of Erie I wouldn't be going into that lake in a 14' anything, even 14' deep Lund!. Never. My 19'6"" is too small many days after going out in glass like conditions. As soon as I feel a wind shift, off the water I head. If there is any breeze in the AM there are stiff winds all afternoon.  I swear by WindFinder.com. Also check weather.gc.ca for Eastern Erie reports. When it says 1/2 to 1 meter waves forget about it, I can gaurantee you 6 foot or more swells during gusts. 10 knot winds is my stay home and golf winds because if it says 10 there will be gusts to 15knts or more.  I beg you not to go out on this Lake in a tinny, please.  I have to add. Right know if I told you the lake has 1 foot Walleye chop one would think it would be fine to head out on, only 12"" no big deal. Bit that 1 foot chop has white caps on them, far different than slight 1 foot roll. This tells me the caps are remnants of large breakers only a few miles out. Sure enough I look by telescope and it's very rough not far from shore. Plus the wind is blowing harder that the wave height would indicate, it's going to be rough until 5PM then lay down till around 8PM, then pick up again.  20 years watching this Lake now full time. Years before coming out fishing. She can be scary."
858345,iFish4real,2014-06-14 16:30:00,386,Dude...u really sound like u wanna keep that lake only for yourself ))) I've been there many times before in my 14' lund and waves were nasty but still made it to shore safely after catching lots of perch... Nice try anyway
858346,leaf4,2014-06-14 16:38:00,2466,hopefully those are not famous last words! good luck
858349,misfish,2014-06-14 16:40:00,29133,It was blowing good out there on Simcoe.  Fly fishing the creeks was the right call.
858353,iFish4real,2014-06-14 16:50:00,386,Seriously... we can make the difference between stupid and rational...
