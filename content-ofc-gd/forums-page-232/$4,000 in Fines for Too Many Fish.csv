857981,leaf4,2014-06-12 22:52:00,2466,"not trying to be rude but it can't just be me that reads through these things and noticed the amount of Asian names that end up with fines, seems like a blatant disregard in most situations"
857983,Whitespinnerbait,2014-06-12 22:54:00,2038,"Well surprise, surprise...The dudes in question are Asian"

857997,Roy,2014-06-13 00:21:00,13728,Please be careful of what you post. Pulling the race card on these things is classless an quite inaccurate. Thanks.

Even though no race or culture has the market cornered when it comes to infractions, as far as this particular article reads the boys who ventured on that ooohhhh so scary path were bang on. Just saying."

858067,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-13 06:17:00,8243,I would suggest all subscribe to the Ministry site through the link TJ has so kindly provided. Some great info there.  Question about transporting live fish. If they are alive in my live well when I put the boat on the trailer am I in violation? I usually try and shut off the recirc pump well before hitting port but have found a few alive when I get to the closest store to throw a bag of ice in the livewell. I'm talking 150 perch sometimes from Erie. And I check if any are alive before leaving the marina.  But am I in violation as soon as that boat is on land and they aren't all dead?
