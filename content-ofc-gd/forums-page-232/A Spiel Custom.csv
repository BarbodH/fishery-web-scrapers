857202,Ron,2014-06-08 20:07:00,1683,"Hey all,  A while back, I had Spiel revive my IMX float rod. My style of fishing has changed and the handle needed to be retrofitted to accommodate a centerpin reel and position on rod. I was contemplating on just having a new rod blank built but with the research I did, I decided to just have the IMX rebuilt. Boy, I am glad I did!      Here are some pics of the rod complete.  As for cost, I got the price down to about $1.10 per fish. Not bad considering I didn't get the rod until some time in March! I liked the build so much, I am getting another one built, so is a buddy of mine. These ones will be on 11.5 Rainshadows. Got a few teaser pics of them too.First, my buddies.Now mineCheers"

858171,aplumma,2014-06-13 20:47:00,6896,I know how you feel I have a few rods he has made me over the years and just about had a heart attack when a friend offered to help me put them in the truck. He opened the door and had 4 of them leaning between the open door and the inside of the truck. If the door had closed all 4 would have been destroyed. I am happy to report nothing happened and my fishing buddy is still alive.lol   Art

858354,misfish,2014-06-14 16:57:00,29133,Nice Ron. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the short butt. You must have wrists of steel.
858355,Handlebarz,2014-06-14 17:01:00,3790,Im guessing we will not hear from Ron for a week or a bit over that I heard from a text bird he is now in the bush with out cell service.
