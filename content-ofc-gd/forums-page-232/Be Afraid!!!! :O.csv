857132,SirCranksalot,2014-06-08 01:19:00,3291,I remember seeing a video where an octopus grabbed a shark and ate it!
857168,Dave Bailey,2014-06-08 14:03:00,1641,"Don't know how deep in the flesh the transmitter is, but a possible explanation: Cookiecutter shark. It could have bitten out and swallowed the spot where the transmitter was, and then descended; they dive very deep. And they aren't big: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookiecutter_shark"

857497,kickingfrog,2014-06-10 17:23:00,8333,Nobody makes a show about an improperly attached tag falling off.
857558,mosquito,2014-06-10 21:38:00,111,"They do admit tags fall off, you can see the shark Betsy's tag on it's way to England.  Betsy's other tag is good though and she is swimming around west of Florida.  http://www.ocearch.org/  Betsy is almost 4m Species: White Shark  Gender: Female Stage of Life: Immature Length: 12 ft. 7 in. Weight: 1,400 lb. Tag Date: Aug 12, 2013   and the biggest on there seems to be Lydia..big enough to eat a 3m for sure.    Species: White Shark  Gender: Female Stage of Life: Mature Length: 14 ft. 6 in. (4.4 meters) Weight: Approx. 2000 lbs."
858121,milton44,2014-06-13 15:21:00,1,"Australian here, there are plenty of whites around to knock off a 3m one. I'm from one of the biggest white breeding grounds in Aus and 2.5-3.5m sharks were pretty common along with the bulls and tigers. There were also resident sharks closer to 5 and further north when the whales would migrate the big girls came out (5-6+). Theres a museum up near Fraser Island (Hervey Bay) of a guy who used to catch these back in the 70s-80s (Vic Hislop). There is a 5+ meter one on ice as well as a picture/painting of the biggest one he caught which went over 6."
858126,BillM,2014-06-13 16:09:00,17367,I would guess another great white as well or possibly an Atlantic.

857007,bushart,2014-06-07 01:34:00,2628,And that's why I always spool power pro...just n case a super predator hits my berkley bait while i'm back trollin with my Merc Motor and Crestliner boat and stayin at the Best Western and gettin my Tim Horton's coffee on my way to the launch tryin not to spill anything in my Dodge Ram with the Sportsman edition storage lockers but luckily I've got Yokohama tires for greater stability.   WHAT THE FRIG EATS A 3 METRE SAHARK!!!!!!!!
857009,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-07 01:40:00,10439, WHAT THE FRIG EATS A 3 METRE SAHARK!!!!!!!!  I'll let you know when I catch it. Just need to get a few 3 metre Great Whites for bait first.
857011,bushart,2014-06-07 01:47:00,2628,"I wanna see ya Drop Shot rig a 3 metre great white  'WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT"""
857012,kickingfrog,2014-06-07 01:51:00,8333,"If the tag data isn't defective all that can be said for sure is that it appears that the tag was ""eaten"". Whether or not the shark was."
857013,Tim Mills,2014-06-07 01:56:00,476,Very interesting. Watching the video I was hoping the super predator would show itself boat side and eat the shark.  You would think the shark would have the speed to elude most whales. Is a giant squid capable of eating a shark that size?
857016,kickingfrog,2014-06-07 02:05:00,8333,"Not sure about the speed thing but sperm whales and orcas are really the only species big enough to eat a 9 foot shark, or at least part of it."
857019,Joey,2014-06-07 02:21:00,9122,I'm thinking it was just the tag that got eaten too.  Wonder why they didn't mention that as an option.
857022,Burtess,2014-06-07 02:40:00,901,"Another Great White shark ate it........   stomach temperature of Great White shark is reportedly 13 - 25 F over ambient, so 46F to 78F change in temperature could make sense.  Orca does not make sense since the inner temp of these whales looks to be 97.5 to 100F.....  Sperm whale I don't think eats something this large.   Burt"
857025,Steelheadphycho,2014-06-07 03:05:00,470,  BUUUUURP! I ate it...........
857026,Steelheadphycho,2014-06-07 03:08:00,470,"""Here's to swimmin with bow-legged women"""
857029,Locnar,2014-06-07 03:22:00,645,"Orcas are known to kill great whites. I would place my bet on the suspect being an orca, or a group of orcas."

857033,dhickey,2014-06-07 04:01:00,1038,I guess a kayak is out of the question?
857037,bushart,2014-06-07 10:39:00,2628,I thought whales only ate Krill and Leaf fans
857040,mosquito,2014-06-07 11:40:00,111,What eats a 3m shark... a 5m shark.I had a 2m reef shark make some real close approaches to myself and my son when snorkelling last winter down south....a 2m shark doesn't sound too big on TV but looks HUGE when it is coming in at you for the 3rd time getting closer each time.... we got out of the water!
857050,Christopheraaron,2014-06-07 13:26:00,3525,I'm thinking it was just the tag that got eaten too.  Wonder why they didn't mention that as an option. Because it's not as exciting  I'd bet it was either another shark that took a bite out of it in a fight.
857052,GbayGiant,2014-06-07 13:37:00,1780,Big baits. Catch Big fish!  
857053,Canuck2fan,2014-06-07 13:37:00,1444,"Sharks aren't just predators they are in the food chain too.... Again anything could have knocked the tag off and a friggin mackerel could have eaten it if it was shiny. I don't think the people tagging it did to many stress tests to see just how attached the tag was ( I know I would saying HEY BOSS on WORRIES that tag is IN THERE really good, now can I get my 8.25 an hour LOL)  "
