857880,16 Footer,2014-06-12 15:59:00,191,My water softener is 20+ years old and needs to be replaced. Town well water is too hard and a softener is a must. I plan to move in 5 years and do not want to spend big $ on a new softener. Any commendations on good reliable reasonably priced water softeners would be appreciated.
857883,Gerritt,2014-06-12 16:01:00,6129,Call culligan about a rental? They are not too much monthly. I think mine when I lived in caledonia was about 15 bux a month...  Edit to add.... I have one in my current house that is not needed or used... Perhaps if interested send me a pm. All it will cost you is the drive down here and the modification costs to the plumbing.  G

You will save enough money on salt to pay for the softener. Btw, we use on average 125 gallons of water a day, the unit keeps track of all this and more, so we don't scrimp on water."

857928,16 Footer,2014-06-12 19:54:00,191,"I checked out the high efficiency model at Culligan and they quoted $3,500 plus tax. It will take along time to save on salt to cover the extra cost over a regular softener."

858150,ssminnow,2014-06-13 18:42:00,48,"I replaced mine about 4 years ago with one from TSC.  It was on sale for $400 for 30,000 grain model.  TSC seems to have one model on sale for about 40-50% off at least once a month. The brand was Miralcle Water MW-30.  It has worked fine so far.  Don't now how much water we use but there is 3 of us in the house. The water here is 15 grain water and little or no iron.  I put in a 20 kg bay about  every 6-8 weeks I would say if I were guessing."
