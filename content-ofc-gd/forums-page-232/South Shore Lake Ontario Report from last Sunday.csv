We were on the water by around 530. It was tough seeing the fish on Richards little screen.    Richard got this Brown on the Dipsey ,  I also lost a small rainbow on the dipsey.    We each got a decent sized Laker on the down rigger rods.  The guys in the other boat caught a couple of small kings.     We caught the fish on brightly coloured spoons.  The first laker was caught on a spoon that looked like the bottom spin dr.    I'd never seen that seat base style rod holder before.    It was a good learning experience, thanks to Richard and Shawn for letting me tag along."
