The trip was very successful to say the least with lots of trout caught , good weather , good friends and no bugs ! Here is a small report of our weekend .  Arrived at the trail head fairly early to a cloudy and cool start . A couple things I noticed right away was that there were no bugs to speak of and the surrounding trees had just started to bud out , felt like March instead of May but I wasn't complaining it was just good to be out after a looooong winter !    The trail ride in was the wettest I have ever seen it , with a couple small washouts but nothing we couldn't handle      The main trail is really no big deal just long ( 10 km ) with a few mud crossings and rock climbs . Its the off shoot trail to the lake that is narrow , muddy and filled with tire splitting rocks .    Once at camp we set up the tents cut up some firewood and headed out to find the lakers . The water temp. was pretty cool ( 49 degrees ) so we knew the lake trout would be in shallow and scattered throughout the lake . The trolling gear was setup with a 1/2 oz inline weight and spoons . The lake trout were quite aggressive all weekend and seemed to be really favoring the gold/red cleo that my boat partner had tied on . I had a silver williams tied on that usually works but not this weekend , the gold and red was the ticket ! Here are just a few of the fish we caught that weekend              Out of the 4 days we are there we have at least one fish fry , a couple unlucky lake trout for the pan      We were actually casting the shore for the lake trout as well , they were really up shallow , but this was my view for most of the weekend trolling along ( very relaxing )    Here is a picture of our boats successful lure choices  , 3"" silver husky jerk , 3/4 oz darter with a fluke and the famous gold/red cleo    Hope you enjoyed my little report and I hope to be back up there in a couple months , until then ...........    Cheers       "

858301,solopaddler,2014-06-14 11:08:00,8605,Very cool! I just returned from a fly in trip out of White River for lakers and the gold/red cleo was also killer. FWIW that lure has traditionally been a killer for lake trout so I'm not surprised! Many of our fish last week were already deep and a large number of them were caught on leadcore.
