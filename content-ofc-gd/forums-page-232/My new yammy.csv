My older 30 hp Suzuki would push my boat at 30 mph with just myself & gear in the boat.  That was scary fast for a 14 footer.  The yammy although 10 Hp lighter does 23.  I'm very pleased with it's performance.  I would also like to add the sales & service people at Bay City Marine in Hamilton were great to deal with.  I now have a 30hp Suzuki for sale.  PM me."

858167,scugpg,2014-06-13 20:29:00,1373,Congrats bay city is great.  Did either of you guys get power trim on your 20? Interested to see if its a true trim where you can adjust it while trying or on a plane rather than a tilt only setup.
858262,Lunatic,2014-06-14 00:57:00,536,"no power trim,sorry."
858292,Freshtrax,2014-06-14 05:59:00,2215,How much for the Suzuki ?   Is it a tiller or not?
