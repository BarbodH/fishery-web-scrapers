858054,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-13 03:29:00,8243,"Hey Shloim ready to sell that beautiful boat yet? I'll give you what you paid!!!  Good luck and as I said in my PM go hammer them little buggers. Send us a report.  After all the launching tips, don't forget the gas.  As I type this Wynne has her girlfriend on stage giving her acceptance speech. Time to make that move to Nova Scotia, I'm very serious. I'm too old for this crap."
858128,Shloim,2014-06-13 16:31:00,515,"Let me get it wet once at least! Had my mechanic buddy over yesterday he gave it the once over, even changed the lower unit oil and did a compression test. Got 145 on both cylinders and 2 thumbs up over all and hes a tough critic.  As far as Wynne goes and all the candidates in my opinion, god help us were gonna need it! And gas is going up today as if we haven't suffered enough"
858129,grimsbylander,2014-06-13 16:44:00,3016,I pulled out of the driveway with the onboard charger still plugged in. Made it EXACLY 25'.
858147,Raf,2014-06-13 18:17:00,3495,"I forgot the plug once and I don't think I will ever again.  Realized it as soon as I tapped the brakes at the bottom of the ramp and she slid in.  Wasn't a big deal as it was still attached by rope, quickly pulled her back on the trailer and ran the bilge.  Straps once as well but I can see that happening again.  In both cases, I was thankfully the only one at the launch."
858162,lew,2014-06-13 20:15:00,12766,"In both cases, I was thankfully the only one at the launch.  Yeah, it never hurts as much if no one see's the screw up LOL"
858177,JoshS,2014-06-13 21:34:00,729,First time I ever launched I forgot to take everything off the back.. transom saver and straps. That was a good laugh
858274,mike rousseau,2014-06-14 02:28:00,4661,That's my number 1... Lol  I do that once a month... Lmao...  I've forgotten the transom straps...  And once my brother was pulling me out at a weigh in and didn't flip the switch on the winch... I have rollers... Rolled right off the back... Luckily I had a bit of water under the motor and was holing it straight... Skeg hit hard but no damage other then the underside of the skew getting scratched... Btw... This was my brand new yammy!!!! Everyone at the weigh in heard me yelling as I rolled off the trailer...    Oh and I've done the plug a few times... That's no biggy... Lol
857736,Shloim,2014-06-11 20:35:00,515,Getting out this Saturday for the first time. Gotta admit a bit nervous about launching the first time solo...  I've tried to post pics but its a pain in butt and I don't have the patience. I'm fishing near midland on the Trent in the lost channel area. Launching at Big Chute any advice on what to target and what I should use???
857779,FloatnFly,2014-06-11 23:53:00,1640,target anything except for bass
857781,Pikeslayer,2014-06-11 23:57:00,1443,You may want to invite an experienced local member if your nervous about launching solo and are short on patience . I'd be happy to help you out but Midlands a little far for me.
857784,Pigeontroller,2014-06-12 00:29:00,2793,"Good advice from Pikeslayer. If you're an inexperienced boater take someone along that can help and offer advice. If backing up a trailer is something new, do yourself a favour and find an empty parking lot and practice! A busy boat launch is no place to begin. Worry about the fishing later. Take the boat out, get used to it, figure things out."
857793,SuperDave,2014-06-12 01:09:00,204,and don't forget the plug!
857802,Tim Mills,2014-06-12 01:59:00,476,I know the feeling it can be intimidating. The first few trips out I have taken experienced boaters with me and it really helped.  Its also good if you can get out on their boat.  There are also some good Youtube videos about launching boats.  Make sure you have your safety gear with you in case you get in trouble or get stopped.
857814,mikeh,2014-06-12 03:03:00,824,buy yourself a good GPS/depth finder and study the maps  also  stay between the markers as there are lots of shoals in the georgian bay area  good luck on the maiden voyage
857818,Paudash,2014-06-12 03:18:00,273,"took my new to me boat out for the first time Monday night, spent the first 20 mins floating around trying to get it started.  Forgot how turn on the choke switch.  Just floated around thinking how am going to tell my wife I just bought a lemon then I finally remembered about the choke switch and it fired right up  first trips are always fun and memorable"
857822,tender52,2014-06-12 04:13:00,270,I woud set her a float in Glouster pool. Do a nice cruise through little chute. Or are you going to stay above the locks?
857833,Shloim,2014-06-12 11:11:00,515,"Well I would love to do the pool but my final destination is a friends cottage on lost channel and I think I'll be ok. I have considerable experience I've just never done it all, alone, and with my own boat....so I'm basically heading north east from Big Chute. If any mbers wanna come out PM me I'll be launching at big chute around 7:30-8:00 Saturday!"
857866,bigbuck,2014-06-12 14:47:00,2449,"3 things, remember the key, the plug and tie a line from the boat to the do k ag the launch before you let the boat loose so it does not drift away. Make sure you get a chart of the area. Wherever you go, have a current chart,best advice I was ever given."
857875,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-12 15:26:00,8243,"Make a check list of everything you need on that boat, checklist for safety items, back up items for the boat, what you will need if you get a flat, towing it and do a walk around like a preflight check, for trailering, launching including starting, docking, shuting down, and loading onto trailer for trip back. Then a list for parking, like blocking wheels etc.  Check lists don't forget, don't get mad, they don't get exited and never get hot and tired.  Make a check list and don't forget anything.  And don't forget the proof of boat registration, something I never did until last year when the OPP let it slide during an inspection, it's supposed to onboard the vessel, not in the truck with the trailer ownership or at home somewhere.  Also while I'm at it the batteries in the water tight flashlight if you don't have flares, something I always forget to check regularly. The flashlight has to actually work."
857896,Freshtrax,2014-06-12 17:29:00,2215,"Step one put plug in  Step two remove transom  straps, deploy bumpers and tie 20 ft length of rope from bow of boat to trailer.   Final unhook trailer winch.  Step three backup and hit the brakes firmly at the bottom of the ramp.   Boat will slide off and then pull forward gently with truck.  Do not do any of this with a roller trailer.   Honestly if it's a busy ramp ask someone to help,  if it's not busy just back in deep.get in the water and push it of the trailer ( make shure you have a long rope attached)  then walk around to dock and pull your boat back in , secure it then pull truck and trailer out."
857904,lew,2014-06-12 18:33:00,12766," Step two remove transom straps,   And even with 50 odd years experience backing boats into the water, you WILL occasionally forget to remove those darned transom straps....believe me"
857906,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-12 18:37:00,8243,
857909,Shloim,2014-06-12 18:40:00,515,"I think I can, I think I can... I'm sure I'll make some mistake but thanks for the advice!"
857910,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-12 18:40:00,8243,"X2, how embarrassing, even dragged the transom saver up a ramp once, what in the Lords name is that noise? Lucky I didn't loose it, another 100 bucks goof tax."
857911,esoxansteel,2014-06-12 18:41:00,1307,"Watched 2 guys in a new Mer Benz SUV, launch a brand new Lund Baron, with an e z loader trailer with rollers, they apparnetly unhooked the winch strap from the trailer and backed down the launch at the Dutch Marine on Chemong lake, and the new lund rolled back off the rollers, and slid down the ashpault ramp eventially ending up in the water, with some major damage to the hull bottom, practice before you get to the ramp"
857916,misfish,2014-06-12 19:11:00,29133," And even with 50 odd years experience backing boats into the water, you WILL occasionally forget to remove those darned transom straps....believe me   Dont forget the transom saver,,,,,,,,,,, Why wont that boat come off the trailer???????????"
857960,SuperDave,2014-06-12 21:48:00,204,"  Dont forget the transom saver,,,,,,,,,,, Why wont that boat come off the trailer??????????? LOL been there done that too. And the straps as well. And the plug too! I've done it all it's the fun? part of boating."
857986,Shloim,2014-06-12 23:05:00,515,You guys give me such hope....   ;)
857988,BillM,2014-06-12 23:08:00,17367,"Watched 2 guys in a new Mer Benz SUV, launch a brand new Lund Baron, with an e z loader trailer with rollers, they apparnetly unhooked the winch strap from the trailer and backed down the launch at the Dutch Marine on Chemong lake, and the new lund rolled back off the rollers, and slid down the ashpault ramp eventially ending up in the water, with some major damage to the hull bottom, practice before you get to the ramp  Had this happen the very first time I launched a boat with rollers.  Luckily no damage, just a bruised ego (it ended up with the transom hitting the sand in about 6 inches of water.   GREASED LIGHTNING!  Now the strap only comes off when the boat is in the water   All those years removing the strap/safety chain with bunks, it didn't even cross my mind."
857995,workwear,2014-06-12 23:25:00,592,best advice i was ever given while backin a trailor was to grab the steering wheel from the bottom...and steer in the direction you wanna go.....when your hands are at the top...its the reverse  also very important........navigate the boat very very very slowing round docks and ramps...for some reason boat manufacturers dont install brakes on them  now youve said your on your own....youll need a long rope....back up the trailer to the point where itll come off....at this point youll need to tie a rope from your boat to the dock...  back the boat off...oh make sure you have enuf slack..
858019,HTHM,2014-06-13 01:46:00,4082,"X 2 on the checklist, I had one on the back of my boat and used it most of the time. I have made all the mistakes as well. Except for having the boat fall off the trailer."
858034,kickingfrog,2014-06-13 02:15:00,8333,I went down the driveway with the jack wheel still on the ground.
