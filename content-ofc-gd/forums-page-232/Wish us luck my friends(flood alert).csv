Fort frances, international falls and rainy river have began sandbagging. FN's northwest bay and stanji are also currently in trouble. The township of rainy river looks to be in much danger, the river is feet from the township. More rain forecasted as well. Geez. We are pretty safe/elevated here but i think will go help our friends sandbag in rainy river. Crazy"
