858009,Roy,2014-06-13 01:17:00,13728,"Yes Cliff I did read it around 7 or so this morning. Whisky was online after we had fixed it the last time. So far, I think it has to do with his password but still I have no real reason why he can't get in....give me another day please."
858012,Big Cliff,2014-06-13 01:27:00,6899,Thanks so much Roy. I'll let him know!
