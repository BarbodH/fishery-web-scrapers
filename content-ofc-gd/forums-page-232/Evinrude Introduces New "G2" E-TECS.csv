858443,craigdritchie,2014-06-15 01:17:00,1586,"Today (yes, a Saturday) BRP formally introduced its new second generation, or ""G2"" E-TEC outboards at a gala unveiling in Milwaukee.  There are six new engines - a 200HO, 225, 225HO, 250, 250HO and a 300. All use the same 3.4L V6 block with direct fuel injection.  BRP says the G2 engines produce up to 75% fewer emissions than current generation four-strokes, 15% better fuel efficiency, and 20% more torque. They have digital throttles and shift, use a new power steering system and - wait for it - come in a choice of colours. The side panels and top panel of the cowling can be removed, so you can order the engine with the colours that you like best or that match your boat. Present choice is five colours, and 14 different accent colours.  No word on retail pricing. They're apparently going to be available in early fall.  Click here to read an article in the local Milwaukee paper on them. More info to follow.  "

858448,BillM,2014-06-15 01:36:00,17367,Reminds me of Star Trek.
858449,captpierre,2014-06-15 01:38:00,2521,impressive.  I think they have had power head trouble with their 1st generation big engines
858451,Gerritt,2014-06-15 01:47:00,6129,Welcome the iEvinrude.... I see this being a giant PIA for dealers with buyers wanting colour options.....  G
858456,BillM,2014-06-15 02:02:00,17367,"impressive.  I think they have had power head trouble with their 1st generation big engines  They did, and they didn't like to warranty them either.   One of the reasons you'll find all the Canadian Coast Guard boats powered by Yamaha this year"
858458,Bernie,2014-06-15 02:23:00,3190,If the engines were under warranty there were no issues with BRP at our shop.My 2001 175 ETEC is still running strong. Used every day through open water season since new.
858471,grimsbylander,2014-06-15 03:50:00,3016,Different looking design for sure. Every year the outboard companies advertise a 10-15% reduction in fuel consumption. In 10 years they'll have some explaining to do. Haha I'd love to have a red 200HO on my boat.
858484,Gerry,2014-06-15 06:38:00,257,"Radical......I like it. But, will they improve the quality issues."
