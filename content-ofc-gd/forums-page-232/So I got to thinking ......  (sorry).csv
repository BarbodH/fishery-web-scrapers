What is to stop someone from flying a quadra-copter into a prison yard and drop a few ‘tools’ off to a select few inmates.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eibyRBcmLvc  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2lj4mEaMdM&index=130&list=PLr6ILQvWUgT0Y56v1XydzvEk1NV1BnPz9  Is it legal to possess something like this in Canada?

Apparently the guards in the courtyard areas are unarmed, because they don't want to take a chance on the prisoners getting hold of weapons."
857512,bman32,2014-06-10 18:37:00,27,Can't really build a prison to be impossible to break into. They are designed to not be broken out of. I'm assuming guard towers with automatic rifles would ruin a helicopters day. Not like the civilian models are armoured.

I listen to a project in high school on Millhaven and Sainte Anne des Plaines, both are built off identical plans with a SHU added (special handling unit) basically 23 hour solitary confinement. They represent our Max security prisons replacing Kingston Pen. and i remember hearing that the guards are armed with C7 assault rifles on patrol vehicles"
