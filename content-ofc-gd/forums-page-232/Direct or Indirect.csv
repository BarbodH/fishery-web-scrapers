857743,wkrp,2014-06-11 21:14:00,656,I lost power to my fishfinder last time out fishing. I had it hooked up to the fuse panel on the console. It was pretty hard to trouble shoot on the water. So my question is is it a good idea to run the fishfinder wires direct to the battery ?

So my question is is it a good idea to run the fishfinder wires direct to the battery ? In line fuse is cheap and worth it's weight in gold..I would not hook anything up without one when your talking descent dollars for your electronics. Run it directly but make sure there is a fuse.

I hate where my panel is, just hate it. The only thing on the boat that bothers me.  If I had have lost my GPS in a gravy type fog 2 weeks ago on Erie I certain we would have been in trouble, even with my good quality compass. I would have ended up on the rocks for sure."
