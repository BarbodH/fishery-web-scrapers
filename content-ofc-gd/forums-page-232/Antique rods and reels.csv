Mitchell 300(I have 1 already), Cardinal etc. The sellers seem to want a pretty penny for most of these. Why? Are folks making a pile of dough off these or what?"
858213,kickingfrog,2014-06-13 22:52:00,8333,"People can ask whatever they want. A buyer can offer whatever they want.  If the two can't come to an agreement then one of them didn't want/need the item, or the money, enough."
858221,bushart,2014-06-13 23:05:00,2628,The original mitchell 300 was the cutting edge at the time of spinning reels---they made various models later called the 300---not the same animal
858225,Tom McCutcheon,2014-06-13 23:08:00,627,You can't leave the original Cardinal 4 off that list either. It and the Mitchell 300 were the GO TO reels in the 60's
858236,OhioFisherman,2014-06-13 23:26:00,6623,"I think some people believe that just because their reel is old it is worth a fortune? Some of those old reels were produced in massive quantities, those are not usually the ones that carry the premium price.  Collectors, look for condition and rarity usually unless they are limited to certain reels, some are difficult to find in any condition, but who wants to spend a fortune for a piece of junk?"

Made a tidy profit selling it on Ebay.
858240,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-13 23:32:00,10439,You can't leave the original Cardinal 4 off that list either.  Still own one of those.
