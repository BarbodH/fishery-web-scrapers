( by south river)I have not found much online in regards to this. I am going up there in a couple of weeks and just thought to ask you guys. Any help would be great thanks. Cheers"

857509,Roy,2014-06-10 18:26:00,13728,"The Mikisew Park site says ""Eagle Lake is a popular fishing lake for Walleye, Small and Large mouth Bass, Lake Whitefish, Perch and Northern Pike.""."
857655,Bassjunkey,2014-06-11 13:35:00,10,"Thanks guys, I saw the write up to the lake as well but on further searching and different postings all I saw was everyone talking about the bass fishing. Plus I called them up and none of the people there said they ever see walleye being caught there. So I thought better to ask on here. Hence the question. Well if they are there I will  search them out and hopefully have a few for shore lunch. Thanks again."
857656,bushart,2014-06-11 13:45:00,2628,It's a very clear lake (my wife's parents have a cottage on Eagle)  So keep that in mind when searching them out---what walleyes do in clear water
857667,Bassjunkey,2014-06-11 15:33:00,10,"Thanks bushart, I will scout out the lake a bit and try find some deep holes and hoping to get a few at dawn and dusk trolling the shoreline. I will repost the turnout when I get back. Thanks again."
