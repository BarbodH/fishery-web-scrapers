731703,Fang,2012-09-22 12:45:00,1330,Has anyone recently seen the moonshine casting spoons anywhere in the west end. My glow Cleos are getting old and not holding a charge at all. Was out casting last night and saw the moonshine spoons in action.  Saw a few dirty old boots jumping around the breakwall but other than that it was deadly quiet.
