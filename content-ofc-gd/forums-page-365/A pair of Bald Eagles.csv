730271,lew,2012-09-16 21:51:00,12766,"Seems every year we get more Bald Eagles around the Kawarthas and fortunately, there's at least a couple that I see regularily around here.  Today these 2 were quite low and spent about 10 minutes circling directly above the house and I was able to get a few pictures with my point & shoot which unfortunately, just couldn't zoom them in close enough.  Sure wish I had Joey's camera today.  I don't know about anyone else, but to me, these bird are just plain majestic and it sure is nice to have them around.  Hope you enjoy these pics            "
730274,Joey,2012-09-16 21:57:00,9122,"Just awesome Lew, I love seeing the bald eagles when we go up north.  Maybe you might want to get yourself a camera like mine for next time  You should be having a birthday or something soon right, maybe Christmas"
730280,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 22:08:00,3525,Yup they are beautiful animals! I think Joey is on contract from blacks! LOL
730358,motv8tr,2012-09-17 00:40:00,2587,"They are my favorite of all the birds, great shots Lew...  Maureen"
730398,ehg,2012-09-17 02:19:00,2666,It is great to see them down that way.  What a treat to see them and get some photos. Great stuff!
730401,Joeytier,2012-09-17 02:42:00,3990,awesome!  I was lucky enough to spot a few on the Ott river last weekend.
730409,manitoubass2,2012-09-17 03:08:00,11391,"Hey Lew, I have 6 around my house right now! I have no idea what they actually do, but the ones around our house appear to be doing the same thing as in your pics.  Beauty birds for sure, I love seeing them. This time of year, I'm not too sure what their doing, but the sure are active. Flying in loops, chasing each other down etc, very cool to see, especially so close to the ground  Thanks for the pics, much appreciated!!!!"
730437,mike rousseau,2012-09-17 11:10:00,4661,Saw a pair of huge eagles on the Larry yesterday... Not bald eagles tho... But they were huge.... Going at it with an osprey... The eagles made the osprey look like a sparrow
730438,Roy,2012-09-17 11:13:00,13728,"Goldens I guess.  Edited to add: Y'know, we're just on the cusp of the turkey vulture summer range and with a 65"" wing span they'll dwarf an eagle.....could be...."
730444,lew,2012-09-17 11:41:00,12766,"Your right Roy, we've got lots of those turkey vultures around here too and there HUGE. Seems like whenever little Marvin is out in the yard there's even more circling overhead"
730446,Roy,2012-09-17 11:53:00,13728,"I wouldn't worry about Marvin, Lew. Vultures are carrion eaters. I'd be more inclined to worry about the balds and goldens...also coyotes if you have them."
730540,fishnsled,2012-09-17 17:54:00,3520,Always a great sight to see Lew. Thanks for posting the pics.
730619,OhioFisherman,2012-09-17 22:52:00,6623,"Great pictures Lew, the only birds I get circling here are the buzzards, as slow as I move they must think I am half dead? LOL  A couple of years ago I was out in the yard and my neighbors had their Italian Greyhound out running loose in their yard, a hawk kept diving on it trying to get it. They are smallish, light dogs, 8-10 pounds. When I told them they took the dog inside."
730896,Tootsie II,2012-09-18 21:15:00,162,You didn't have a small dog or a cat running around the yard at the time did you? My cousin and his wife had to start watching for eagles when their Shitzu was out in the yard at their place at Mattagami Lake near Gogama.
730907,Rattletrap2,2012-09-18 21:48:00,1652,"Nice photos Lew! Be careful with Ol' Marvin. Our friends lost an old teacup poodle to an owl one night in their yard!The dog was very frail and old, and I guess the owl used this to it's advantage. There were other small dogs in the yard, but this one was the slowest and weakest. Easy prey!"
730925,lew,2012-09-18 22:51:00,12766,"Marvins put on a few pounds in his old age so the birds may have a problem lifting him now, but we do keep and eye on him when the eagles are around.  One of the neighbors did tell us recently though, that their cat went missing and they figure it was grabbed by a big owl they'd seen in the area several times.  There was another bear right at the end of my driveway this afternoon and he may be more of a concern to the dogs around here than the birds.  There's at least 4 that live in the bush behind me and they get seen all over the place at all times of the day and night."
731076,bigbuck,2012-09-19 14:25:00,2449,"Lew, just make sure that you don't leave any food scraps or garbage out. Once those bears start coming round, they keep coming round looking for an easy meal. Keep a close eye on marvin."
731084,lew,2012-09-19 14:49:00,12766,"There's never a scrap of food or any type of garbage left outside around here Bruce, absolutely nothing to attract them."
731114,NAW,2012-09-19 16:23:00,4022,"Nice pics Lew.  I was lucky enough two see two bald eagles across the road from my house last year.  I thought it was such a rare occasion to see two flying together in my neighbourhood, that I should maybe go buy a lotory ticket or something.  Then 5 minutes later, my wife called and told me she was pergnant"
731116,captpierre,2012-09-19 16:31:00,2521,Watched a 2 minute dogfight between a Bald Eagle and a seagull on Pigeon.  The eagle got close several times but the seagull became exhausted and had to ditch in the water a few times for a second.  Then it abruptly ended.  Not sure if the eagle wanted the seagull or a fish the gull had.  Didn't see one.   Amazing
731348,bigbuck,2012-09-20 13:42:00,2449,"Good. You around on Sunday?? I might be heading up to Pigeon for our annual tourney. I'm hoping to wet a line depending on how work proceeds at the cottage on Saturday. I'll be hitting the water probably around 10am or so depending on how long it takes me to drag the boat from HH to Bobcaygeon. Also, when you coming to HH for a day?? I'll pm you some potential dates next week."
731360,ProFishermanJones,2012-09-20 14:36:00,77,"Nice pictures, just in the lat 2 days I've seen hawks migrating, about 3000+ birds all in a straight line and a big ball as far as the eye could see, then i seen a single bald eagle and an osprey!"
731370,ch312,2012-09-20 15:00:00,1590," it's awesome that they're making a comeback and sighting them is becoming more and more common every year.  here in brantford there has been a nesting pair near wilkes dam the last couple years. we had the opportunity to see our first ""baby"" (immature, not colored like an adult yet) bald eagle this summer too.  cambridge has a few flying around the river too..."
731389,lew,2012-09-20 16:33:00,12766, It's a coincidence that you posted that because I've had a young eagle flying overhead for the last hour. He's cruising up & down the shoreline so I spose he's searching for  shallow swimming fish.  Smaller than the adults I posted the other day and this guy is very dark with a black head.  Still a beautiful bird even when there young.  Here's a couple pictures I got of him.        
731727,ch312,2012-09-22 15:27:00,1590," that's awesome! i tried getting some action shots of the eagles fishing, but my camera skills are definitely lacking. maybe you're a bit better in that department?  quite honestly, i had no clue that the immature eagle we saw was in fact an eagle until it landed right beside the adult bird near the nest. anyone know how many eggs are laid each year and the survival rate of young bald eagles?"
