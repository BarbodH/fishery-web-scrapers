731293,John,2012-09-20 02:40:00,2956,"Amazing Ron, what a trip! Let's hope we do as well when we finally get together on SC......."
731302,mirogak,2012-09-20 03:32:00,387,Impressive indeed
731305,tb4me,2012-09-20 04:09:00,3295,"Niced work Ron! Now thats somthing id like once, never 4 times in one weekend.."
731310,Terry,2012-09-20 09:37:00,14456,did Keith let you catch any of them....lol
731331,RangerGuy,2012-09-20 12:54:00,564,"Nice Job Man!.. 4 50""+ fish that's just sick!"
731333,Handlebarz,2012-09-20 13:08:00,3790,Ronnie it was awesome To see you guys again. Awesome fish for sure I was wondering how long you could hold out on not sharing that weekend.  The big girls down here have been very hot on the big blades the last month and a half. Just think they say the best is yet to come.
731345,bigbuck,2012-09-20 13:35:00,2449,Holy cow!!!! Those are some beauty 'skis!! I guess bucktails DO work LOL. Those Handlebarz look great and your fishing trip is a testimonial that they catch fish too. NICE!!
731347,ehg,2012-09-20 13:40:00,2666,4 50+ inch musky in  a weekend. I'm convinced that Lake St. Clair area is the premiere musky fishery in the world.
731351,fishnsled,2012-09-20 14:07:00,3520,Very impressive indeed. WTG gents!!   Mike - I'll have what they were using.
731352,Harrison,2012-09-20 14:08:00,2202, Amazing Ron!!!!  I'd be so pumped I wouldn't of realized I'd lost an elbow either!  This is a great shot of you pal!
731353,mepps,2012-09-20 14:13:00,1301,"You cant ask for a weekend much better than that! Awesome stuff! I've been planning to add a few of those Handlebarz to my lure collection, guess I better do it soon!"
731412,Rich Clemens,2012-09-20 19:35:00,3131,Simply AWESOME !!!!
731444,Ron,2012-09-20 22:35:00,1683," Tks..... I now understand the saying.... The sky is falling! The sky is falling!  It's not easy doing clouds either.  Cheers, Ron..."
731461,esoxansteel,2012-09-20 23:46:00,1307,"Nice shootin for you and Keith, Ronnie, very impressive, thats the place it could happen though, talk about prime feeding windows, with big fat spotties,  "
731468,danc,2012-09-21 00:24:00,4677,Just awesome Ron and Keith. Thats one the best Muskie posts ever on here.
731493,Jen,2012-09-21 02:04:00,833,"Truly awesome, Chilli told me about the fish you caught I was amazed...Great to see the pictures! Kudos"
731512,tonka-toy,2012-09-21 03:44:00,139,"wow...pretty good trip,or season,or decade."
731650,Whopper,2012-09-22 00:41:00,2174,"Sounds like an amazing weekend, congrats to you and Kieth.  Thanks for sharing"
731756,Spiel,2012-09-22 17:32:00,9065,Wow! What more can I say?  Good stuff Ron and a great testament to the effectiveness of Mr. Parkers lures.
731768,SlowPoke,2012-09-22 18:34:00,2984,"I'm not only happy (and jealous) for you guys but I'm happy for Mike. I'm sure he'd give away his Handlebarz lures if he could afford to just for the thrill of hearing about such great success stories. At the price he's selling them for, he ain't getting rich! Those are some great looking fish and I hope to get ONE some day!!!"
731770,Squid,2012-09-22 18:37:00,1656,Sweet Sweet fish!!!
731791,mistyriver1,2012-09-22 20:26:00,600,Congrats Guys !! Truly a weekend to remember.  Well done.  Jim
731851,ttahhan,2012-09-23 01:25:00,191,AWESOME FISH BOYS ! EXCITEMENT AT IT'S PEAK....
731203,Ron,2012-09-19 21:48:00,1683,"A good friend and myself planned a trip for Muskie. After a stop to get some of Mike's Handlebarz dbl 10's we were off to see if we can hook into at least one muskie for the weekend. What happened after launching the boat went beyond anyone's imagination! Not only did we boat a Muskie, but we boated 4 Muskie over 50 inches over the weekend. I am still in shock!  All fish came on Mike Parker's Handlebarz dbl 10's. He is selling these way too cheap if you ask me. The quality is beyond any Cowgirl I have seen, especially for the price!  Blazin Walleye coughed up a few and a few other ""custom"" colors did the rest of the work.  Thanks for maken them up for us Mike, muchly appreciated!            Here is Mike's web site if anyone is interested... http://www.handlebarzmuskylures.com  Cheers, Ron..."
731204,Christopheraaron,2012-09-19 21:51:00,3525,"Great fish there ronny, but what's with the waders, weren't you boiling?!"
731205,glen,2012-09-19 21:53:00,2641,Must have been fun.  Thanks for the pics.  Did you catch any small ones?
731206,davey buoy,2012-09-19 21:53:00,5505,Good for you guys!!!Must of been a awesome feeling. I'm still looking for my first 40'+. LOL.
731207,Ron,2012-09-19 21:54:00,1683,"  Tks  It is actually Gortex Pro Qualifier rain gear. Keeps the slime off us and therefore out of the truck.   Cheers, Ron..."
731209,Live2fish85,2012-09-19 21:55:00,1633,That is awesome. Those are some wicked muskie. I am going to be there soon so I can't wait.
731211,glen,2012-09-19 22:01:00,2641,Did you catch any small ones?   I guess you dont mind getting your boat slimmed.
731213,Roy,2012-09-19 22:03:00,13728,"WTG Ron, you know your stuff !!!!!!!!!!!!!! You and your Bud did super well. Glad the Handlebarz did so well but if you use them there's no doubt they'll produce. Thanks for this great report.....another for the archives."
731216,irishfield,2012-09-19 22:05:00,26272,You sure it was the lures and not that Keith guy.... he's a friggin fish magnet! LOL  Great stuff lads and yes Mike makes some great baits. Have a handfull of them myself that I need to get using.
731223,lew,2012-09-19 22:22:00,12766,"Awesome fishing boys, infact very impressive  !!"
731224,landry,2012-09-19 22:22:00,1005,Good job! Nice fish! I was out on the same body of water on Sunday but it started getting rough and we moved west as I was worried we would get in trouble. We should have stuck it out in hindsight as the winds never got worse. The area we fished seemed empty of fish or we were devoid of skills???? How deep we're you fishing if you don't mind me asking as we hit it all between 5 and 17? Landry
731225,Musky or Specks,2012-09-19 22:24:00,2710,You just joined Borger on my list. 20 yrs and I still haven't hit 50
