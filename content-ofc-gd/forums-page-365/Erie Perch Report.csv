Definitely glad I got the full top when I bought the boat because we put it to the test today!  Anyhow, 60 fow and they were on fire!  We caught 50 in a couple hours and 40 of them were good keepers.  I also spent the last 2 weeks building my own rod, and it was awesome to catch them on something I made myself (shout out to Spiel for a lot of awesome advice while building it).  I'll post some pics of the finished product.  Not craftsman quality, but pretty darn good for a first attempt."
