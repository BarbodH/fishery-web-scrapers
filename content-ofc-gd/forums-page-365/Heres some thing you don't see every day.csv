731833,Woodsman,2012-09-22 23:39:00,1286,No problem being proud of your son & keeping pic's like this. Actually almost expected. The difference between the two is one is a newspaper article and the other a direct advertizement. Just hoping he didn't get taken advantage of. If he has not signed a waiver he could be due a good settlement.
