732406,mirogak,2012-09-25 03:45:00,387," So true - but guess what, I just finished the deck boards.  Think I am gonna sleep like a baby ..."
732166,mirogak,2012-09-24 17:09:00,387,"Of course - the answer for most of you will be fishing but unfortunately for me , I think, I have to finish my deck (90% done) and begin the work on my shed as the temperatures are dropping fast and won't be long before the trees start shedding.  THIS     OR this        For those trout fishermen, enjoy the closing weekend on my behalf too.  Miro"
732170,solopaddler,2012-09-24 17:18:00,8605,"That's a no brainer Miro, finish the deck. Looking good so far btw."
732173,ttahhan,2012-09-24 17:24:00,191,Finish the deck! just do it
732177,jimmer,2012-09-24 17:32:00,2730,"Those trout look pretty good. Only one closing weekend a year, I would choose the fishing. You live in T.O., lots of time to finish those projects."
732179,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 17:32:00,3525,"Trout, trout, trout, trout! I'll be at the same lake as you were this week in Algonquin, just to add to the jealousy."
732181,mirogak,2012-09-24 17:35:00,387, NOoooooooooooooooo stop it ....!!!!
732186,woodenboater,2012-09-24 17:54:00,2277,"Deck. That's one job I'd hate to be putting off, esp while the weather is half decent."
732187,Musky or Specks,2012-09-24 17:55:00,2710,7 months to finish the deck till trout opener. Only 7 days left to fish in the park.
732190,mirogak,2012-09-24 18:01:00,387, OMG - love the how the 7's fit right in...  Alright - seems I have to reassess my situation on Thursday evening and will make my mind up on that night.  I just hope I don't regret either decision.
732192,Musky or Specks,2012-09-24 18:19:00,2710,I know eh. Its like its trying to tell you something
732193,fishnsled,2012-09-24 18:25:00,3520,Squeeze in as much deck work as you can this week and finish it (or as close as possible). Then fish on the weekend. Best of both worlds.  Then complete the deck next week/weekend if necessary. What you have done looks great!
732198,torco,2012-09-24 19:13:00,656,"Go fishing if you can....I know I just came back from a 3 day fishing weekend and the first thing my wife said to me is don't expect to go fishing this coming weekend or you'll come home to the locks changed. It sounded like a Brad Paisley song, my response was well I'll take the van, at least I can fit everything I need in it  The point of this rambling is unless your wife is going to lock you out of the house if you go fishing, its best to get out and get the last weekend of the season in since the deck does not care if it is done this week or next!  I should add this of course is all in jest. I am not actually going fishing next weekend, and if that deck needs to be finished sooner than later, you probably should get it done."
732207,solopaddler,2012-09-24 19:35:00,8605,"Never let fishing take precedence over your other responsibilities. Home and family always come first, no exceptions.  I speak from experience."
732210,misfish,2012-09-24 19:54:00,29133," Yeah your lack of reports tell that story,,,,,,,,,   Lots of good fishing to be had. Finish the deck. If ya lived closer,I would give ya a hand to finish it up quicker.  Are you covering that with 5/4 decking?"
732214,solopaddler,2012-09-24 20:11:00,8605,  I can see where that comment's coming from.  But if the general public at large knew what I did with the rest of my time you might be surprised.  Work hard and play harder.
732215,mirogak,2012-09-24 20:15:00,387,You guys are tearing me apart even more.  Yes - those will be covered with 5/4 14 foot boards.
732220,misfish,2012-09-24 20:23:00,29133,  I wouldnt be surprised Mike.   Hard work (in many ways of life) makes for more playing.
732224,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-09-24 20:39:00,310,"With gorgeous fall colors like these, is it even a debate?    I think it's safe to say that once completed, your deck won't look this good. "
732226,misfish,2012-09-24 20:45:00,29133, Use screws.
732227,Twocoda,2012-09-24 20:51:00,4130,The deck will still be waiting for you after fishing...if the wife and family arent...just rent one in the off seasons..lol...the time it takes for you to keep checking in on every ones responses to this thread....it could be finished..  I kid of course
732262,trevy727,2012-09-24 23:05:00,351,Why aren't you working on your deck now rather than on the computer asking stupid questions. Pound some boards down now! And then go fishing!
732309,Joeytier,2012-09-25 00:18:00,3990,Plenty of great trout fishing to be had after the park closes...
732323,northernpike56,2012-09-25 00:39:00,717,"I know what I'll be doing... Fishing brookies!! Try and get the deck done after work, then fish on the weekend."
732403,mirogak,2012-09-25 03:38:00,387, Definitely brother. I will be using galvanized screws and even predrillimg them to avoid cracks.  And thx for offering help. Appreciate it.
732405,mirogak,2012-09-25 03:42:00,387,.
