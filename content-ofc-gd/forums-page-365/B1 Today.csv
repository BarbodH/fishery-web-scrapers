732022,grimsbylander,2012-09-23 22:18:00,3016,"It all comes down to education and experience. I have a 20ft Ranger and spend 90% of my time on Erie. I been caught out in 5+'s and would not dream of owning another boat. For battling big water waves, other than the fiberglass walleye style fishing boats, I choose my Ranger."
732023,Whitespinnerbait,2012-09-23 22:41:00,2038,Hmmmmmmmmmmm............I'm fishing in a Bass tournament on LSF Oct 6th WITH MY 14 FOOT TINNY  :canadian  :
732026,BillM,2012-09-23 22:48:00,17367," You require a 20ft Ranger, get with the times!"
732035,Harrison,2012-09-23 23:34:00,2202," Severe chop?  Have you ever stuffed your ranger?  I've run bass boats and deep v's across Lake Ontario, Simcoe and other big bodies of water in very angry weather.  It really doesn't matter what boat your are in, it is no fun, none at all.  Hands down I would take a Deep V in the really rough stuff, no doubt about it.  A Glass Deep V is a true rough water gem."
732036,UglyBug,2012-09-23 23:43:00,148,"Have I ever stuffed my Ranger, yup sure did came around a point into the main body of water I fish in and hit the wind and chop dead on took me by suprise speared the wave dead on at about 25 mph but the boat handled it like a champ. I know lots of guys who fish LSF for bass and go out in all kinds of weather. Would I fish walleye from it nope, not because the boat could not handle the water but it's not set up for that species, and neither am I    "
732038,backbay,2012-09-23 23:48:00,773," /Thread. Everybody's local conditions are different when nasty, you don't become a hero simply because you went out, then were able to make it home again."
732039,UglyBug,2012-09-23 23:49:00,148," My my aren't you a sarcastic type. Superman LOL not at all, no where did is say LSF I said I have fished in rough weather. I guess your rough weather is rougher than mine LOL.  Unlike many I have nothing to prove to anyone just the facts mam just the fact LOL   and if I have to die I can think of no place better than doing what I love, fishing from my Ranger"
732043,mercman,2012-09-24 00:11:00,7054,  
732066,darsky,2012-09-24 01:47:00,586,I don't want to die out fishing in my boat. Not good. Would upset a few people.
732067,i2cool2fool,2012-09-24 01:50:00,349,I don't know you but would be saddened.
732098,BillM,2012-09-24 04:06:00,17367,"Drowning in a Ranger definitely doesn't sound like a good way to go, I can't believe anyone would think that, lol!"
732124,Headhunter,2012-09-24 13:12:00,5703,"I fished a Quinte Fishing Series tourney a number of years ago... it was like piss on a plate at blast off, so many made long runs to hit spots... launch was out of Trenton. As the day progressed, so did the wind... Big Bay was pretty angry by 2:00pm... came around the corner point of the bay to greet 5-6 footers... buddy's Targa 20ft boat, very deep V glass handled it pretty well, the two big bass boats that flipped end over end, not so well. Everyone was ultimately safe/rescued, but I think a few lessons were learned... Know your boat and know what the body of water your on can do, when it get's a little riled up! HH"
732128,i2cool2fool,2012-09-24 13:26:00,349,Yikes. Glad to hear everyone was fine at the end of the day.
731715,darsky,2012-09-22 14:13:00,586,"overcast,showers,and high winds and that's the better news. Day 2 will be rain,higher winds AND cold front. Me thinks fish will be deep and weights will be low. I can't imagine doing the long run west against the 35+ kph wind and waves.Looking forward to today's results."
731745,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 16:27:00,4661,Loving it...
731749,Roy,2012-09-22 16:42:00,13728,Hey Darren....I haven't looked at the roster. Did Currie register this year?
731750,misfish,2012-09-22 16:59:00,29133,"it will show,who are the men,and who are the crazies.  Whats first place? Is it worth the run? Time will tell."
731752,Roy,2012-09-22 17:12:00,13728,This is the payout Brian.  http://www.berkleyb1.com/payout.html
731755,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 17:28:00,4661,It'll truelly seperate the ones that  are willing to work for it...
731760,misfish,2012-09-22 17:52:00,29133," Thanks Roy.  Nice boat(but I dought my Avenger could haul it)LOL,but I dont know if I would bash mine up on a chance."
731766,darsky,2012-09-22 18:17:00,586,no Roy-not registered and not interested.
731794,DaveMc,2012-09-22 20:37:00,89,"some big bags being weighed in, 23.51 topped the scales the last i saw, and i lost count how many 18lb bags i saw weighed."
731806,Dan668,2012-09-22 21:46:00,1120,Awesome
731899,DaveMc,2012-09-23 12:55:00,89,"they have had to cancel day 2 due to severe weather, the awards ceremony will take place at noon."
731904,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 13:13:00,4661,What?????  It's beautiful out today....  Sunny Bluebird skys And reasonable wind   I guess that means I can go out and not be bothered...
731919,DaveMc,2012-09-23 14:18:00,89," 20k wind gusting to 40k in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec according to environment canada"
731922,mercman,2012-09-23 14:27:00,7054,"  Not compatble with a floating bass platform, thats for sure."
731932,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 15:51:00,4661,I guess safety first... That's good that the organizers are on the ball for safety...  Just surprised....  Maybe in the future they can launch in a more protected area then if it's nice hit the open water... And if it's nasty they are already in the protection of the islands...  But it's hard for anywhere to handle 150 boats launching...
731933,mercman,2012-09-23 15:57:00,7054,"Especially in Valleyfield. I have fished there a number of times this summer, and west winds of 20K produce huge waves and very difficlt launching where they held the event.Its one long stretch of water from Lancaster to Valleyfield with nothing to slow down the wind."
731934,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 16:10:00,4661,I've never been in a bass boat before.... Kinda figured they could handle some heavy weather.... They are 18-22 feet long with plenty of power...
731936,Roy,2012-09-23 16:16:00,13728," They're not made like yours Mike. They'll stay afloat in bad weather, the problem is trying to stand up to cast (and stay standing)."
731939,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 16:19:00,4661, I guess so  Man overboard is a terrible situation.... Any time of year
731941,lew,2012-09-23 16:23:00,12766,"I remember the 1st November OFC g2g we had at Quinte a few years ago and it was extremely rough, but the only boat that was swamped was a big bass boat. They sunk that boat down in the water all the way to the gunnels and the 3 guys aboard were up to their knees in water.  Some guys say their OK for rough waters, but when it gets nasty out, I'll take a deep-V anyday."
731958,i2cool2fool,2012-09-23 17:31:00,349,Indeed. A deep V matches my comfort level and compliments my fishing preferences. I like the flexibility to target multiple species and bodies of water.
731982,DaveMc,2012-09-23 19:06:00,89, Driver makes all the difference.  it is nice to see the organizers put the safety of its anglers first.
732001,UglyBug,2012-09-23 21:01:00,148,"Totally disagree, I fish in all kinds of weather including severe chop. Never felt like I was going overboard and I stand all day. It comes down to knowing what your doing, what's going on around you, always wearing a life vest and not being stupid on the water. Fish like weather and so do I. I was out a few weeks ago with wind gusts to 35 mph and felt completely safe. Mind you I own a Ranger so that might be why :-)   "
732013,darsky,2012-09-23 21:47:00,586,""" I was out a few weeks ago with wind gusts to 35 mph and felt completely safe.""  Just curious-were you out fishing on L ST Francis on this particular day? Do you know that you can die out on Francis ? I know someone personally who fishes that lake out of a 21.5 ft RANGER and will not think about making the run from Vallyfield to Lancaster or anywhere west of that under the conditions that you brag about going out in. You must be Superman in a boat.Not the first time I have heard this."
732014,mercman,2012-09-23 21:48:00,7054, I think most people have never actually seen a Ranger BB out of water.Most assume its a flat bottom fishing platform. Your Ranger has a very pronounced V shaped hull which gives it incredible stability on the water.That and the width of the boat make it very comforable in choppy water.  edited to add  Wouldnt want to have it on Franny in 35mph winds out in the open though.The Franny is a whole different ball game for sure.
