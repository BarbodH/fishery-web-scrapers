731277,GBW,2012-09-20 01:40:00,8460,please send the youtube link when it's up as I have better things to do right now like have a beer and a smoke.  I can watch it from my cell at lunch if you do if the host is that bad...

They dummed down a very interesting subject that has dramatic potential for the future. The technology is amazing but I could not help but think that the implementation would require really cleaver technicians, like the ones that Tiger moms raise...in China. That opinion is actually shared by Ken Whiting who I happen to know and is an expert who believes the best quality rods are now coming from Asia. The furure is now and ours does not look all that bright.."
