730735,kickingfrog,2012-09-18 13:11:00,8333,Blue Jays expected to announce deal with Buffalo Bisons for AAA team.  In all seriousness the Bisons have a great history and play in a beautiful ballpark and I think this is good for the Jays.  http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2012/09/bisons-blue-jays-agree-on-affilation.html
730739,Headhunter,2012-09-18 13:31:00,5703,"I think this is a really good move for the Jays... Escobar's recent move, not so much! HH"
730766,blaque,2012-09-18 15:06:00,2419,Its funny how we have that gem of a ballpark thats actually in the right location (downtown) for our minor league baseball team. Yet we still have this antiquated NFL stadium miles from civilization? I guess i shouldnt complain........it would suck tailgating in parking garages in downtown Buffalo.
730779,Billy Bob,2012-09-18 15:37:00,5865," It was proposed by some radio guy....never hear of him or seen him before...but Channel 2 interviewed him last week...his idea was to build a football domed stadium downtown...when asked about tailgating he said you have to give up something to get something....well the way Ralph fields team, the tailgating is the BEST part of the day...take that out and no fans will come."
730781,Billy Bob,2012-09-18 15:39:00,5865,The Blue Jays will be better then the Mets...but the best was Indians...wish they would re-contract with them. Better yet get a REAL MLB team in here and do away with the Bills and Sabres....
731230,Garry2Rs,2012-09-19 22:50:00,1425,Oops...I thought this thread was hinting that the Jays could win a few more games by playing in the Minors.
731424,Stoty,2012-09-20 20:38:00,2910, Jays or Leafs..???
731500,GreenCanada,2012-09-21 02:22:00,375, Take your pick at this point! And that's coming from a fan of both teams
731504,HTHM,2012-09-21 02:44:00,4082,Hey at least the Leafs won't have a losing season this year....
731562,Stoty,2012-09-21 15:23:00,2910, They'll find a way... dont worry! LOL
731587,Billy Bob,2012-09-21 17:21:00,5865, OR a winning season............
731610,misfish,2012-09-21 19:13:00,29133,Maybe the Argos should get the Bills as their farm team.
731699,Billy Bob,2012-09-22 12:09:00,5865, For the Canadian Football league.....is that still around....
