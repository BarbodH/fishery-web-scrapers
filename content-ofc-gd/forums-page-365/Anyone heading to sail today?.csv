731319,Handlebarz,2012-09-20 12:12:00,3790,Im heading up TI check out sail on Weston road will be there around 9:30-10am looking at some more bulldogs they have great prices and no tax right now.  I also want to know what do you all store your bulldogs in? I was just using the Plano boxes when I only had 4 I'm at 9 now and adding colors today just looking for new options.
731323,backbay,2012-09-20 12:27:00,773,"Mike, I only have two, so keeping them in a 3700 box is no problem. Time to treat yourself to an Encase?"
731340,bigbuck,2012-09-20 13:28:00,2449,"I've got a soft sided Flambeau tackle bag that fits musky sized lures and it works great for me. Plenty of storage for leaders, tools, etc...."
731372,Handlebarz,2012-09-20 15:14:00,3790,Just left sail what a great store was talking with a couple guys in the fishing  department great guys. Prices are awesome not over priced good selection also. I will be back when passing through the gta
731380,Joey,2012-09-20 16:07:00,9122,"Damn, wish I had read this earlier, I'd have met you there for some of your Handlebarz Lures Mike!!!  Gonna be heading up to Nip shortly and wanted to take some with me.   As for my bulldog, I just leave it on the boat floor  "
731384,Handlebarz,2012-09-20 16:25:00,3790,Lol I like that color Joey bet it would be awesome on nip. It would have been nice to see you again I got a feeling it will be soon
731385,Joey,2012-09-20 16:27:00,9122," yes, I have a feeling too"
731433,mike rousseau,2012-09-20 21:50:00,4661,I pile em Plano trays... I have a box with 8-10 plastic baits... Bulldogs... Bondy baits.... Red October tubes....  I don't worry about color bleed because I haven't experienced much... And of I do... I'll call it a custom...lol
731528,outllaw,2012-09-21 10:25:00,1232,"joey your bulldog is beautifull.he/she is the right st clair color lol. too bad the dont come with webbed feet, better swim action. just kiddin eh."
731624,landry,2012-09-21 21:28:00,1005,  I use a milk crate with plastic downspout for bait holders. If you put a plastic liner in the bottom the tails will rest on the bottom and not poke through. Saw it on another Muskie site. I have 3 boxes and just mix and match for what I need. The boxes actually slide right under my deck addition and act as supports on my crestliner fish hawk.
731627,F_ast,2012-09-21 21:58:00,154,"Good idea Landry.  I use both open and section large planos like the others.  One thing I do try, is to keep ""like colours"" together.  I have had dark baits bleed their colours onto lighter baits."
731641,landry,2012-09-21 23:43:00,1005, I just stole the idea.  Hey mike. How much were the dawgs????? Landry
731644,Handlebarz,2012-09-22 00:01:00,3790,I have been using the down spout for many years now I use soft sided cooler bags which work well.  The mag dogs were $15.99 smaller ones $18.99 double dogs and pounders 19.99 and double pounders $29.99
731714,landry,2012-09-22 14:08:00,1005, Thanks mike. I plan on going tomorrow. Those r verrrry good prices. Landry
