732061,SlowPoke,2012-09-24 01:19:00,2984,"Two piece rods are fine, you just don't get the same selection you would in a one piece rod. Before deciding on a rod, take the reel and try it on a number of rods and pick the one that feels best balance-wise."
732063,uglyfish,2012-09-24 01:28:00,981,"Buy a curado and a compre. They are designed to go together. Compre is cheap as far as rods go, but very high quality and have a lifetime warrenty"
732071,northernpike56,2012-09-24 02:48:00,717,"There seems to be a much lower selection for 2 piece as well, which is why I am kind of leaning towards a 1 piece now. However I somehow need to fit this potential rod into the trunk of a mazda 3 (seats do fold down), but that would mean I couldn't bring any friends with me fishing with my new rod cause it would take up the back seat...  Maybe the option is to buy a 2 piece rod right now then buy a 1 piece compre or verdict next season, and just use the reel interchangeably."
732075,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 02:55:00,3525,"I can get a 6'6 going from the trunk of our crv to the front going over the seats, don't know how much room you have though..."
732077,BillM,2012-09-24 03:03:00,17367," Perhaps from shore, but from a boat a 7ft rod is the perfect rod for jerkbaits, topwaters, whatever. (Unless you're a midget, lol)"
732078,northernpike56,2012-09-24 03:07:00,717,"Yeah I've gotten 72"" 2x4's in the car before, so I could probably angle the rod diagonally, and have it go across the passenger seat. God help me if I ever take a turn too fast  I've been looking on BPS, and maybe I could get a 6'6MH vendetta 2 pc, and then a 6'10 MH compre 1 pc."
732107,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 11:11:00,3525," Actually I've had problems from boat too and I am about 5' 8""."
732108,Live2fish85,2012-09-24 11:45:00,1633,  It may not be the rod as much as the operator lol.  7' is not a problem. I use a 8' for musky and have no problem with jerk baits.  Northernpike there is not need to put it through the trunk. Just put it through the passenger door and have the handle at the feet and the tip dangling in the back seat passengers face lol. I don't put them in the trunk as something can roll on it and break it.
732110,goteeboy,2012-09-24 11:53:00,175," It's good that you're finally entering the world of real fishing, haha, just kidding.  I think if you want to get decent gear, it's worth while to consider buying used stuff.  I do it all the time via fishing forums and ebay.  You will be able to get a set up that you'll really enjoy for your price range.  In terms of the reel you'll need to decide on round or low profile, though most seem to be going the way of low profile these days, as the manufacturers have really been beefing up the gears and for more comfort.  If you can get an older shimano chronarch 101D (these were the gold standard a decade ago) for a $100 I don't think you'd regret it.  I had one a while back and they casted just as far if not farther and smoother than modern reels. Or a Daiwa fuego magnesium. I have one, bought it on ebay, beefed in up w/ orange seal boca bearings, and it's just silky smooth.  And then buy a St. Croix Premier 6'6"" or 7' MH also used...and you're set.  Good luck.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/SHIMANO-BANTAM-CHRONARCH-101A-LEFTY-BAITCASTING-REEL-/150887838667?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item23219db3cb  or  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Team-Daiwa-Fuego-Reel-Buy-it-Now-or-Best-Offer-/110953660032?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19d55a7e80  or  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Shimano-Curado-201-E7-Baitcasting-Reel-Choose-Size-M-10-110yd-7-1-1-7-2oz-LH-/271062711824?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f1c98be10"
732112,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 12:23:00,3525, But how do you work them? If you went to the side then it woldnt be an issue but I like to work them with big sweeps straight down.
732116,Live2fish85,2012-09-24 12:37:00,1633,It all depends on what lure you are using and how you want to work it.  If they tip goes in the water it really doesn't hurt anything. I try to keep it out but if it happens oh well. I mean my rod goes in atleast a foot when I do a figure 8 so they are to scared.  If there is a will theres a way haha. I don't think the fish care if you are pulling straight down or side ways. Jerkbaits are meant to be worked to make it look like a injured bait fish if it twitches enough they will take it.
732117,Ainsley,2012-09-24 12:38:00,142,"Let me add another recommendation for the shimano curado E series.  They can be hard to find now but keep checking kijiji and other online classifieds. I have the entire line up of E series reels and the 200E7 is the best general purpose reel.  For a rod I'd suggest a shimano calus, compre or a st. Croix premier.  7' is the way to go, Infact my past two rods were 7'4"" one piece. The extra length really helps make longer casts in open water."
732131,BillM,2012-09-24 13:32:00,17367, Get outta here with this non-sense!  LOL!
732134,BillM,2012-09-24 14:02:00,17367, I use my nieces Dora rod for jerkbaits.   It's pretty awesome
732139,mepps,2012-09-24 14:44:00,1301,"I've got several baitcasters and for a starter real I think the Diawa Megaforce series is top notch! They will be under $100 at BPS. I'm a huge Shimano and Quantum fan but the Megaforce is by far the easiest and most forgiving real I own. I've taught several of my friends (who aren't regular fishermen)to use them in about an hour with minimal backlash.  That being said, the Megaforce died this summer after 4 years of pretty serious use. I was casting some fairly big lures with it that I really shouldnt have though...plastic gears dont like heavy lures.  Replaced with a Shimano Caius which is also solid for a reel under $100. If you can spend an extra $50 or so you will get a much better reel."
732152,kickingfrog,2012-09-24 16:05:00,8333,"Angler hight (as well as preference) can make a difference, but so does the hight of the boat and whether or not you are standing on the floor or a casting platform."
732156,ckrb2007,2012-09-24 16:13:00,449," I agree with the Megaforce reel being super forgiving. My first baitcast combo was the megaforce combo and still use it today. In fact, I landed a 20lb musky this year on it while draggin' tubes for bass. lol My youngest son has started using it and has caught on quickly with minimal trouble. My other preference is the quantum energy pt series. Awesome reels IMO."
732158,SylvanOwner,2012-09-24 16:27:00,266,"  I have a Simano Caenan that I bought from an OFC member a month or so ago that I am selling.  It's a CAE101.  I bought a couple Curado's from him at the same time and didn't really need the Caenan but bought it anyway    .  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the reel, it's virtually brand new and I'm just looking for the $50 I spent on it.  Dan"
732197,davey buoy,2012-09-24 19:06:00,5505,"Been using a canean on a 6' daiwa IM7 MH rod. Super combo,and that reel casts a mile. About $100 for the reel new with the shimano VBS. I use two bait casters, but this one is my main one. Good luck on your search!."

732480,Oryx,2012-09-25 15:27:00,186,"I too just jumped into the the baitcasting pool,  Being a NEWB to this type of setup, i ended up with the Shimano Citica LH and the Shimano Compre 6'10"" 2 pc. MH. LOVE IT  I tried the 6'9"" Abu Veritas rod as well, absolutely hated it, to me, it just did not feel right.  Did not have the casting precision nor the feeling that the compre has. I also like the reel.  Gear ration of 6.x to 1 is great."
732564,lookinforwalleye,2012-09-25 21:29:00,4399,"A couple of years ago at the BPS spring sale I picked up a Johnny Morris Gold signature reel for half price 80 bucks if memory serves and it is a great reel, I have a handful of reels that I paid 2-3 times more but the Morris is in my hands more often than not. If you can find one at that price you will not be disappointed! As far as rods go since you said two piece and again if you can find one try a Shimano Bob Izumi signature(blue one) a super rod for the money!"
731854,northernpike56,2012-09-23 01:48:00,717,"I want to buy myself a baitcasting setup finally. I am a newbie to baitcasting, so don't really know what brands/models to be looking at, nor how to match the rod and reel. All I know is that I want a 7'0 MH 2 piece setup. Left hand retrieve. Anywhere from the $100-$200 range. What are my options?  Thanks,  Matt."
731856,kickingfrog,2012-09-23 02:18:00,8333,There are a lot of options out there. I'd recommend spending more of your budget on the reel because it will make casting easier. You can up grade the rod later. Maybe something like 2/3 of your budget on the reel.
731857,mercman,2012-09-23 02:25:00,7054,I still use the first baitcasting set i ever bought. A Shimano Citica Reel. A truly bullet proof reel for around $139.The VBS brake system is very easy to use. paired with a 6.5 foot MH Fast Quantum PT rod for around $100
731859,chris.brock,2012-09-23 02:33:00,4053,"totally agree with KF, if you go cheap on the reel, it will be a nightmare to use, my vote would be for the Shimano Curado, I've abused mine for almost 20 years and it still works great, my wife (never used a bait caster) tried it this summer and within 15 minutes was whipping casts around no problem"
731861,musky_hunter,2012-09-23 02:43:00,328,some options are the new Daiwa Lexa 100 and Abu Garca Revo S or SX

731873,Muskieman,2012-09-23 05:45:00,2472,Why is everyone sold on Shimano and Loomis ?
731897,GBW,2012-09-23 12:37:00,8460,because they work and work well. I was a 'i don't care what brand as long as it works' guy but I made the more to shimano recently too
731901,Christopheraaron,2012-09-23 13:05:00,3525,I have an ABU Ambassador reel paired with a bass pro 6'6 MH for about $120 and it works great.  Edit: the rod is 1 piece
731902,kickingfrog,2012-09-23 13:11:00,8333," I too like them both, but it does become a bit of a self fulfilling type of thing. They do make some good stuff and you try it. It works, you want to upgrade, you think why change, you buy a level, or 2, up from your last combo and of course it is better then the last, so it confirms what you already thought was true. I do own other brands but I always compare the product back to my comfort zone. I think many of us do that with a lot of things. Vehicles for am example."
731911,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 13:37:00,4661,"  I guess I'll ask...  What type of fishing are you mainly going to use this combo for...?  If its casting then the fellas are right.... Put more money into the reel...  If its drifting or trolling its the opposite.... Spend more on a quality sensitive rod because you don't need to cast....  If its a complete mix of techniques then I'd spend $100 on both the rod and the reel... For 200 you can get a solid combo that can do everything ""ok""..."
731912,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 13:43:00,4661,Like I'm a troller... I use a baitcaster set up... My rod is $450 and my reel is $150... I did this because I need to feel EVERYTHING with the rod... As for a reel I just needed something reliable...
731927,SlowPoke,2012-09-23 15:02:00,2984,"Before you get too far into reel selection, determine if you want a round or low profile reel."
731944,UglyBug,2012-09-23 16:29:00,148,"From my perspective does not really matter as long as your happy with your gear. However I got rid of all my gear and replaced it with GLX IMX and GL2 Loomis rods and switched over to all Chronarch reels in various sizes. Does it make me a better fisherman (nope because I already am the best ) I like the best and IMO nothing beats these two for how I fish, you might have differing ideas but I know what I like. Recently had a 18 year old Loomis IMX Mag bass re-eyed with the Loomis tungsten guides and wow what a rod still. That rod has caught hundreds of fish in18 years and still one of my go to rods. That's quality    "
731959,Beans,2012-09-23 17:37:00,3339," Rather than trying to match a rod to the reel, I'm a firm believer in buying a combo set-up from shimano or diawa for a first time user...once you become an expert at using them then maybe upgrade...I read this advice in the North American Fishermen's magazine many years ago as the manufactures make sure their combos are balanced... it made good sense to me..."
731960,davey buoy,2012-09-23 17:43:00,5505, That's a heck of a idea! A good starting point as to what you may or may not need to upgrade later.
731971,Gregoire,2012-09-23 18:21:00,1397,"I am with Sinclair on looking for used gear, you will get more bang for the buck. I used to be all over the place in terms of reels, but then I started buying shimano reels. Then some of my other reels (ones made by pure fishing) needed repairs and I had a lot of trouble getting parts, even finding places where I could get the parts. If I need parts for a shimano reel I can always stop in at the factory in Peterborough and get it, that is not an option for other manufacturers except for rapala. I am not exclusive to shimano, but if they have a reel in the price range that I am looking for I will buy a shimano over any other company. I do not fathom why someone would spend 100+ $ on a reel if it cannot easily be fixed if it is broken.  If I was just starting out and wanted to buy a new setup I would seriously probably get a shimano citica and pair it with a shimano compre. The rod has a lifetime warranty and if you decide to sell it you could get a decent amount of your money back."
731976,Snidley,2012-09-23 18:41:00,620,"Absolutely avoid ""combos"". It's just the opposite to stated here, the manufacturers go out of their way to make sure that combos are the worst of the worst that they produce. Balance would be the least of your problems with a Combo especially the reel. Go with a quality baitcast reel to learn and if that means you only have the $$$ to buy used then buy quality used gear. Unlike spin reels baitcast reels can be an excellent used buy. I got a used Revo STX here on OFC for $90 and it has been an excellent reel for everything from Bass up to Chinnooks. I have a Diawa TDZ that I bought used for $180 and it also has been a terrific piece of equiptment ( and about the most forgiving reel possible for a new learner)."
731977,BillM,2012-09-23 18:48:00,17367,"Not a fan of combos either..  Definitely spend more on the reel then the rod as everyone has stated.  A cheap reel will give you nothing but headaches, a cheap rod is just a cheap rod.  Citica was my first reel and my oldman still uses it as his walleye rod to pull around worm harnesses..  Never an issue with that reel, it was also fairly cheap ($120 or so)"
731988,uglyfish,2012-09-23 19:32:00,981," If u live anyplace near hamilton, I have a quantum kinetic PT baitcaster ill sell u for 80 and u can use the rest on a rod. Its an excellant reel, easy to use, great brake system, its basically brand new, bought in the spring, Its a step up on the shimano citica, and would be better then the new curado's as well."
732044,northernpike56,2012-09-24 00:23:00,717,"OK, so from what I've read I'm going to buy a curado low-profile style. I don't mind spending money on quality things, I just don't know anything about casting setups, lol. Somebody also mentioned that 2 piece rods were of lower quality... Would a 6'6 MH Abu Verdict 1 piece be a better buy? Does losing that 6 inches on your rod make a difference in casting?  If I were to buy these, would the rod and reel match up? The reason I ask is because I have basically no experience with casting equipment, so have no idea how it should feel, whereas I can pick up a spinning combo in 10 seconds and decide whether I like it or not.  Also, I would only be using the combo for casting, I troll with spinning stuff."
732045,BillM,2012-09-24 00:25:00,17367,"I really like a 7ft rod, regardless if it's 1pc or 2pc."
732051,Christopheraaron,2012-09-24 00:48:00,3525,"If you use jerk baits a lot, a shorter rod will give you more room to work."
732053,mercman,2012-09-24 00:55:00,7054,"  The verdict is an excellent rod for the money.2 pieces is not lower quality.Some people like them, some dont. The only thing i find odd about the verdict is that the metal clamping screw loosens.I got around this by putting a single drop of superglue where the threads mesh.The glue lets go easily if you twist the clamp to remove the reel."
732060,Gregoire,2012-09-24 01:12:00,1397,"Although the claim that 2 pc rods are of inferior quality to 1 pc rods is a generaliztion, I find that 1 pc rods are more senstive than 2 pc rods made of the same material. If I did not have a reason to break a rod down I would choose a 1 pc rod over a two piece."
