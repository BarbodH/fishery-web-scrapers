732199,darsky,2012-09-24 19:14:00,586," After 2 seasons of draining milky oil I brought the boat in for a change of seal kit and its been draining dark used oil color ever since.No it won't cause a problem unless the lower unit has too much water in it and it freezes over the winter,expands and cracks it open."
732206,mike rousseau,2012-09-24 19:33:00,4661,  3 months left of season.... At least 12 hours a week.... So 48 hours a month... 144 hours... Minimum....
732211,lew,2012-09-24 19:59:00,12766, You'll do that much this Saturday
732212,mike rousseau,2012-09-24 20:08:00,4661,  That's why I said at least...  But not my boat this weekend...lol
732258,aplumma,2012-09-24 23:00:00,6896,If you have water in the oil and you let it set it will separate out and give you the illusion it is o.k. Any oil that is milky has water in it. If your boat is not exposed to freezing conditions then the only thing that will happen is corrosion but unless it is stored in a heated space up North I would have it pressure tested/fixed as suggested.

731804,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 21:33:00,4661,Well that didn't take long...  2 months and i have an issue with my new yamaha outboard... But this isnt yamahas fault...  I had a buddy who I won't name (member here) get caught in my prop while trolling... And I wasn't aware due to the fact that I was helping the other guy on the boat land a walleye... So the motor was in forward for about a minut with line in the prop...  And when I did my 100 hour oil changes today my gear oil was milky...   So it would seem my oil seals on the prop shaft have been damaged...  Is this something I can fix myself... Or is this something I should get a pro to fix...?  Let's say 1-10 scale... 10 being a really tricky job...  Thanks
731805,misfish,2012-09-22 21:39:00,29133,"Why was Ron trolling so close to the prop? LOL J/K  Spend the bill,and get it done right.  Peace of mind.  Are you sure the fill holes are sealed/tighen, properly?"
731807,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 21:47:00,4661, They were really really tight actually...
731812,SBCregal,2012-09-22 21:51:00,688,tight enough to maybe squish out any seal/o-ring that was on there?
731821,glen,2012-09-22 22:30:00,2641,Go fishing. Then drain oil   Put oil in a clear bottle wait 24hrs then see how much water is in it  Wait for the off season to fix it
731826,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 22:58:00,4661, So your advising me to to run another 150 hours on my brand spanking new outboard with water getting in the lower unit?  That doesnt seem right to me...
731828,Fishing4Tails,2012-09-22 23:16:00,38,Put new gear oil ..  Check after a few trips .. If it still milky get one to check it .. Best before freeze up .
731829,glen,2012-09-22 23:20:00,2641,One little trip mike.  then pull the oil.
731835,mike rousseau,2012-09-22 23:49:00,4661,Ah
731838,irishfield,2012-09-22 23:55:00,26272,Did you pull the prop and look for any line sticking out of the shaft seal?
731840,glen,2012-09-23 00:07:00,2641,Make sure you put the cotterpin back in.
731841,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 00:12:00,4661, Pulled it and everything looked perfect...  Seals appeared to be in great shape...  The line that wrapped the prop the day it happened was 20lb mono and I got the whole leader back out imidiatly... I had hoped that the larger diameter of the 20lb mone wouldn't cause damage...
731846,strik,2012-09-23 00:36:00,175,Let's say 1-10 scale... 10 being a really tricky job...   If you need to ask...  On a new eng and the amount  you use it  i would go pro   Good luck
731858,Skipper D,2012-09-23 02:31:00,1970,"Well i know am not the one who trolled close to the porp ..... lol , I would ask the dealer Mike why the oil in your new motor lower unit is milky with only 100 hr on it . I can't see the oil get that milky that fast with no line stuck in the prop ."
731866,danc,2012-09-23 03:23:00,4677,"After 30 years of owning a boat, I've never changed my bottom end oil without it being a little ""milky"". Never has it caused me a problem."
731872,Viking,2012-09-23 04:15:00,39,"I would, as suggested change the oil and take it out, then check it again. I wouldn't assume shaft seal though. I'd pressure test lower end to find leak."
731875,Handlebarz,2012-09-23 07:25:00,3790,I would bring it in have them look at it or question them why it might be milky and not talk about the line. Maybe the breakin oil breaks Down in some form like that???  I do remember some one asking about the difference in the original oil and stuff you use after the breakin period. But I have never bought brand new.
731890,Billy Bob,2012-09-23 11:51:00,5865,You need to see evidence of WATER in the oil...not just a milky oil....  Just put a leakage test on it.....bet it doesn't fail it.
731891,F7Firecat,2012-09-23 11:58:00,347,"I had an evinrude that when I changed it would always appear milky, brought it in they pressure tested it passed with flying colours......go figure never had a problem with the lower end but did change the oil religously regardless"
731894,bigbuck,2012-09-23 12:21:00,2449,Take it in and get it pressure tested. Don't mess around. That lower end is 5 grand.
731920,4x4bassin,2012-09-23 14:26:00,1025,"I'm no expert but I can't see #20 mono getting wrapped into the prop for that short of time damaging your seals , I have had #50 PP braid wrap up with no damage . Also maybe your drain/fill plugs were tightened to much thus damaging gaskets ! If I were you I would take it in and get it tested just to be safe , way too much money invested at this point on a brand new engine to screw around !"
731925,Sinker,2012-09-23 14:41:00,8692,"Did you drain it after running it? What I mean is, did you use the engine, then get home and drain it? A lot of times, if you check it after using it, the oil will appear milky, but if you check it after sitting over night it will be clear.  I would drain it, fill it back up, run it for a while, but only check it after its been sitting over night. I bet it comes out clear again.  S."
731928,mike rousseau,2012-09-23 15:03:00,4661,It sat for 12 hours before I drained it...  I put fresh oil in and I'm gunna run it and drain again and see
732195,jimmer,2012-09-24 18:52:00,2730,Definitely bring it back to the dealer and ask why the lower unit oil is milky on a new motor. No way that line should have caused a leak. There could be a bad seal installed or a bad washer on one of the plugs.
732196,NAW,2012-09-24 19:06:00,4022," Leak tests only take a few minutes.  Well worth the effort.  Hey, are you really going to fish 150 hours before end of the season.  What's that, 2 months. 75 hours a month.  That's almost 20 hours a week.  Busy guy!"
