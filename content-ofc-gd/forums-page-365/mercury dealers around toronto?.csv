I was going to order parts online, however if anyone here has a favorite marina/dealer that you trust, and know are honest price wise, I would love to hear it. I would honestly rather support a local business if I can, as long as pricing is competative with other places I have found. Thanks guys"
731876,ttahhan,2012-09-23 09:03:00,191,"Perhaps Bass Pro Shops as i believe they are a Merc Dealer.....hope this helps, which parts are you looking for ???"

731880,Woodsman,2012-09-23 10:47:00,1286,If your not in a big rush your local UAP/NAPA store can order in most parts at a reasonable price. Ask to see the marine cataloge. Delivery can be 3 days to 3 weeks.
