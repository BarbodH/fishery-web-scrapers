731441,backbay,2012-09-20 22:30:00,773,"Pretty much sums it up. I think there are some pretty delirious guys around here, lol!"
731443,Roy,2012-09-20 22:34:00,13728,"I think you're right. If you look at the classifieds, you'll notice that a lot of guys are selling or trading their happiness for newer happinesses."
731447,mercman,2012-09-20 22:43:00,7054,"As soon as you buy the latest happiness, some one goes and introduces a new IMPROVED happiness. So we can always have something to be happy about."
731452,davey buoy,2012-09-20 22:53:00,5505,"I love happy,but happy costs a heck of a lot!!."
731453,backbay,2012-09-20 23:00:00,773,JDM happiness works very well over here as well!
731454,Live2fish85,2012-09-20 23:12:00,1633,I am the happiest man right now.  Got my new fly reel and the rod comes soon lol.
731466,tb4me,2012-09-21 00:15:00,3295,i have been living off the same ol happiness for years now...lol
731470,kuhaman,2012-09-21 00:32:00,503,And beer
731483,cheaptackle,2012-09-21 01:23:00,849,"We really need George Carlin to rewrite ""more stuff"" to ""more happiness""!  Too bad that ain't gonna happen!  Michael"
731485,Christopheraaron,2012-09-21 01:26:00,3525, How about baseball and football to bass and Muskie!
731518,hawk-eye,2012-09-21 04:05:00,141,True.......BUT my happiness quickly turns into sorrow when she finds out how much happiness I bought.
731520,Twocoda,2012-09-21 04:46:00,4130,Happiness is easy to apologize for rather than ask for permission
731533,hawk-eye,2012-09-21 11:46:00,141,"HahahahahahahHhHha Funny you should say that. Last summer at angling outfitters I picked up a new fly reel. Josh had it marked down from $150 to $99. I bought it and asked him to put a $49.99 sticker on it for me. He laughed when I told him the wife would be happy that I got what I wanted for less then half of what I was willing to spend. Let's just say we were both full of ""happiness"" that day."
731538,Harrison,2012-09-21 12:56:00,2202," Nice one!! HA  With eTackle I can change what name reflects on the customers credit card statement.  I was considering something along the lines of ""Gifts for Her"" or ""MAC Makeup""  but thought the single guys may not appreciate it."
731665,funfishing,2012-09-22 02:24:00,147,"Very cool poster, eTackle should sell it, if it doesn't already"
731666,funfishing,2012-09-22 02:25:00,147,"PS. I think the point of the poster is that fishing is happiness, not gear, the gear is just the enabler. Actually I don't think so, I know so, from plenty of first hand experience."
