731762,Woodsman,2012-09-22 17:53:00,1286,And you'd be wrong. Just looked up the contract on the net. Players had the option to opt out on 15 Sep 2009 with proper notice. This they did not do. Contract ended 15 Sep 2011 with the players having the option to extend it until 15 Sep 2012. This they did. Contact remains in effect year to year thereafter unless either party delivers a written notice of termination with the proper notice. This the owners did. It should be obvious who stopped the season. See Article 3 - 2005 NHL/NHLPA Collective Agreement

732004,Dave Bailey,2012-09-23 21:17:00,1641,"Bottom line: 7 years ago Bettman and the owners IMPOSED a settlement, and now because it isn't working it's the fault of the players.  Makes perfect sense to me.  And a correction to those who think that we pay the player's salaries: not one cent that we put into the turnstiles goes to the players, every penny goes to the owners. They then decide how much the players will get. Seems that they decide to pay them a lot, and then whine that they're paying them too much.  Snivelling money-grubbing crybabies."
732017,Woodsman,2012-09-23 21:51:00,1286,"What's not working? Overall the league owners are making a very good profit. Some franchises may not be making money but the blame should be on them for being in the wrong place with the wrong management strategy. Bettmans US strategy. I never could figure out how the southern US was a prime location in places without large numbers of Canadian or northern Americans living there at least seasonally. As for the concept that we the fans are paying for the players salaries yes we are along with the owners profits. Without the fans there would be no NHL. We don't watch = no gate ,no television rights, no merchandise revenue, no sponsor revenue ect. Don't believe for a second we the fans & even non fans don't pay for the players salaries & the owners profits. Every time even a non fan buys a sponsors product they have contributed to the fund."

731403,kickingfrog,2012-09-20 18:31:00,8333,You used an image of a combat soldier for this discussion and I missed the point?
731556,ch312,2012-09-21 15:08:00,1590," i believe you're fully aware of what i'm saying, but you're avoiding the truth at all costs.  hockey players are crying because they feel they're entitled to more money for playing a game while people that are serving our countries get paid peanuts to put their lives on the line and live in hell for months on end."
731567,Woodsman,2012-09-21 15:49:00,1286, ch312 do you actually believe any Canadian soldier has redeployed to Afghanistan & only earns 20 grand a year. Your so far off it makes your point completely useless. Almost as useless as saying the players are on strike. The owners stopped the season instead of continuing negotiating to push their agenda. A strike happens when the players stop the season instead of continuing negotiating to push their agenda which in this case did not happen.
731571,jedimaster,2012-09-21 16:14:00,3472,"I really hate to get into this fight here but a few ponts. 1) The soldier in that picture is american and not canadian, and although I do appreciate any allied solider, the picture would hold more meaning for me if it was of a canadian soldier, just the very same if it were a canadian soldier being shown to am american audience. 2)That picture if I recall was of bertuzi after dealing with the moore incident and not the strike. I doubt any hockey players are actually crying about this. 3)The salary as mentioned of the soldier is actually valid in Canada. I was in the reserves and could have deployed to a warzone but the timing wasn't there for me to do so as I was in school at the time, and I tell you this, I was making less that 20k at the time. You get paid roughly 44 dollars per day, of course rank and what not has an effect on the actual pay rate. Now for Reg force full time non officers, they start at about 33k per year for a private, and go up to 100k for a Chief Warrant Officer.   As for the complaining issue. Hell yah, of course they are complaigning. Would you? I mean should anyone making anything more than a private in the army be allowed to complaign? I complain and I do a hell of a lot less work than a Cheif Warrant Officer does. However I choose to be a civi and not in the Reg Force. Thats a choice. There is no conscription in Canada, although I think it would do some good.  I certainly don't mean to put down the army folks, as I have oodles of respect having put in 6.5 years in the reserves, its just that its a choice. Its not comparable. The two jobs are apples and oranges.  Are the Player's overpaid? I dunno, I guess that depends on your perspective. If you compare it against say a soldier, LEO, CO's, nurses etc... yes. But if you compare it against, basketball players, Baseball players, etc.. I think they are underpaid.  There work generates a certain ammount of revenue. Like it or not, Sidney Crosby generates more revenue than a Private in the canadian army. Due to economics the NHL player will get a bigger salary.  Thats like saying Stallone during the making of Rambo should have made about 3,000 dollars for shooting it. Its just not how the world works.  I mean lets all be a bit reasonable here and look at the facts.  The players said they would work during negotiations. The Owners said no new deal, no hockey.  Who is to blame for there not being a deal? Both, and the players and NHL has said that.  Who am I mad at? The Owners and bettman. Why? They are CHOOOSING to cancel hockey without a new deal, when the current deal is the one they wanted when they locked the players out the last time, and its a deal where all but the teams that IMO should be folded are making oodles of money.  JMHO of course."
731575,jedimaster,2012-09-21 16:27:00,3472,"And the  players actually said, no we don't like your offer, but we will continue to play under the current deal until we can work things out. its a chicken or the egg. In the end the Owners hav the final say if there is hockey or not. The owners say no. its my puck no hockey. The players are saying yes lets play and figure it out as we go.  Further to the complaigning issue as I really hate that argument... her eis another comparisoin for you guys with soldiers...  In the army I at IMP's for about 2 weeks at one point. It tasted like crap, but none of us complained. Does that mean noone in the world is allowed to complain about bad food? No thats just silly."
731577,tb4me,2012-09-21 16:34:00,3295,Well with Tyler Seguin heading to sigh with a swiss team the players union is already showing a divide..It wont be long untill the players accept the owners offer..I hope....If more of OUR young stars head overseas the union will crumble eventually..Thats my opinion anyway. Today was opening day of preseason..Media day..THIS SUCKS.
731578,jedimaster,2012-09-21 16:36:00,3472,"Yah, in reality I don't care  how much they make other than leaving salary cap room for the leafs to possibly improve. I hope one or both cave and a deal gets done. I love watching the Leafs. I will miss it for sure."
731579,Harrison,2012-09-21 16:47:00,2202,"It is not a union gents.  It's an association.     Chris Lomon - NHLPA.com September 21, 2012   For NHLPA member Dan Winnik, this summer has been all about one thing: communication.  A veteran of nearly 366 regular season big-league games, Winnik has been a busy man over the past few months, including his large involvement in the CBA process and a two-week trip to Asia.  “I’ve been fortunate to be part of a lot of meetings throughout the CBA negotiations,” said the 27-year-old. “I’ve had the opportunity to speak with a lot of my fellow players, some of whom I’m played with and some that I’d never met until recently.”  The level of contact, from NHLPA Director Don Fehr, to the interaction between the players, has been ‘unbelievable,’ according to Winnik.  “From young guys to the veterans, teammates or opponents, to Don, the communication is constant,” noted the 265th overall selection in the 2004 Entry Draft. “Everyone is engaged and aware of what is going on at every moment. I’ve talked to a number of guys, either in person, or on the phone, and every player has been brought up to speed. If you have any questions, they are answered immediately. The players are very comfortable in knowing they are aware of everything that is transpiring. Everyone is on the same page.”  There’s no disputing the players belief in Fehr.  “He has an open-door policy, where every player can call at any time and he’s available,” said Winnik, who appeared in 84 regular season games in 2011-12 between Colorado and San Jose. “We’ve been kept in the loop every step of the way…we have a great amount of respect for what he’s done coming to his role with the NHLPA. We were fortunate to get Don. He’s the best in the business.”  With the league-imposed lockout of the players now in effect, Winnik, who starred at the University of New Hampshire for three campaigns, understands the frustration of the fans.  “Before any of us played in this league, we were fans, too,” said Winnik, who signed as a free agent with Anaheim this July. “I was at university during the last lockout and it was disappointing to not watch hockey. We know it’s tough for them. They want to watch us play and we want to be out there playing.  “But in order for us to get back on the ice, there needs to be a fair deal for both sides,” he continued. “Our goal is to work with the owners to make the sure game is on solid ground, to grow the game and ensure stability. We understand the fans just want to see hockey. But this CBA will affect a majority of the careers of the players. We know the passion the fans have for the game. We want to play.”"
731580,Jigger,2012-09-21 16:50:00,1237,My sister married a Swiss. Their home team is Bern. They signed Rick Nash and Jumbo Joe Thornton. Not everyone is depressed over this.
731581,BillM,2012-09-21 16:59:00,17367,"I love these comparison pictures, great for a laugh!"
731582,Woodsman,2012-09-21 17:05:00,1286," Obviously you also have no clue on current pay rates and policies. 1. The lowest current pay rate for a reservist is $88.51 per day. 2. By the time anyone is trained to the standards to be able to deploy they will no longer be at the lowest rate. Basic training plus trades training plus work up training for the tour would take close to 1.5 years if everything happened bang, bang, bang. 3. All Reservist's deploying to Afghanistan are put on Class C service which uses Regular Forces pay scales. 4. As the photo that started this it said ""redeploys"" inferring a second deployment at least. With enforced time between deployments we are now talking a minimum of Corporal basic and even that is unlikely. 5. Corporal basic is minimum $4622 per month. To this add danger pay, separation pay ect. and you are well over $60,000 a year. Taking into account a great portion of the pay will overseas will not be taxed it will have a far higher value.  If someone is going to use figures to argue their point at least use the correct numbers. Do not take this as a complaint about our troops being overpaid because I believe they fully deserve and earn their pay.  BTW: I spent 13 years in the Canadian Forces and did one overseas peacekeeping tour for just over 6 months in length.  Pro Patria: Rick"
731583,jedimaster,2012-09-21 17:12:00,3472,"Considering that picture is about what 6 years old using the current rates is a little bit misleading anyway. And they were using yearly amount not rates during deployment. Not many resvists that I know of had a stay for longer than 6 months, so your basically getting half a year worth of reg force pay and and half a year at reservists pay. so its not going to be anywhere near 60k per year."
731588,jedimaster,2012-09-21 17:23:00,3472,"But just to use the current pay scales.... 6 months as a corporal in the reservers, 2 weekends plus a half day for fridays, 4 half days per month at 129 per day comes out to...  903 per month, for 6 months... is $5418.00  Now add 4622 per month a for 6 months at reg force pay... thats 27.7k plus the 5418 thats 33,150 for the year, plus danger and seperation pay. I believe in afghanistan a corp was getting about 1,900 in danger pay per month. Added to that it used to be about 11 dollar per day for seperation pay.. thats 1980 for 6 months.. so thats an additional $13,380  dollars in danger and separatation for a 6 month tour. However we both know they won't be away for 6 months, maybe 5 months of that, but use the full 6 months anyway...  So 33.1k plus 13.4 is about 46k per year, for a reservist corporal, that has a 6 month tour in an actual danger zone.  Far from 60k per year as you suggest. Yes you are granted an extra 6k or so in tax free income, but at that tax bracket it doesn't amount to a whole lot.  Eiter way the whol point is that yes even though someone in the army make a tiny amount of money compared to a Project Manager or a Hockey Player, or a Gas Station owner, the jobs are not comparable, and I don't see the validity in that comparision.  Becuase some people choose to work harder for less in more danger it doesn't mean those that make more for doing less in less dangerous conditions shouldn't be paid that way.  Heck if that was ture I would make 10 times what my boss makes, but thats going to happen now is it.  and btw not everyone gets separation pay. Not everyone is married or common law. I know I wasn't when I was in."
731607,jedimaster,2012-09-21 19:02:00,3472,Here is a new one... from tsn     I find it interesting that the NHl would think that it should be allowed to operate a franchise in a jurisdiction without having to abide to local laws. Seems weird. I don't know of any companies that are allowed to pick and choose what law it has to abide by when operating in mulitple jurisdictions.
731682,Woodsman,2012-09-22 04:50:00,1286,"I guess letting the facts not confuse your point is not a strong point for you. Your first big mistake is the work up training is 9 - 12 months full time at full time pay plus the 6-10 month tour. No reservist leaves their reserve unit to proceed directly overseas without the possible extremely rare exception & this would never be a reserve Corporal. Maybe a medical Doctor but this would also be rare without some pre-deployment work up. You also forgot to add FOA (field operations allowance for the training periods out of posted location) plus separation allowance if the reservist has a spouse or dependent for the total time of the contract. I was actually underestimating the monetary compensation for a reserve Corporal for one year including the tour time. Total time required for tour would be a minimum of 15 months up to 20 months. Also you could add on free room & board for the total time as it is an attached posting. If the single reservist has furniture & effects & a vehicle these would also be packed and stored at no cost to the member.  Back to my previous statement ""Obviously you also have no clue on current pay rates and policies."""
731725,ch312,2012-09-22 15:09:00,1590,"jeez, some of you (biased hockey fans?) are looking into that picture WAAAAY too much. it's NOT the actual picture i wanted you guys to think about, it's the message behind it. clearly some of you lack the intellect to put two and two together, eh bill?   i hope you guys put as much thought into issues that actually matter to society..."
731726,ch312,2012-09-22 15:19:00,1590," biased fans can't grasp the concept that if the players really ""love the game and want to make the fans happy"" they'd gladly accept cuts to keep on playing. but, they wouldn't accept it as they'd prefer to negotiate while continuing on with the season to get as much money as possible.  like i said before, both sides are equally at fault. it's much easier to see this when your opinion is 100% unbiased"
731728,Roy,2012-09-22 15:27:00,13728,"In keeping with the original topic which is hockey, do the zamboni drivers get paid mileage? In the event of a full season lockout, will the zambonis need to be winterized? If so, who pays for that?"
731731,ch312,2012-09-22 15:42:00,1590," well, at least they'll have some time to play...    :P    seriously though, i don't think anyone has really thought about the rest of the people involved with the game that will be effected by the strike. anyone have some numbers on how many people in the ""other"" category are going to be jobless due to the strike?"
731732,Woodsman,2012-09-22 15:46:00,1286,Gee I was under the impression that EI was paid out of the EI fund which is paid into by both the workers & employers. If the taxpayers are paying the benefits I'll have to find out why I'm paying almost $15 a week (plus my employers contribution goes there also) to a fund that's not used.
731733,Woodsman,2012-09-22 15:51:00,1286,Again not letting the facts confuse your point. Why call it a strike when it is a lockout? A big difference due to who made the decision to halt the season.
731736,Woodsman,2012-09-22 15:58:00,1286,You must be wearing one heck of a set of blinders to have such a narrow view of the situation.
731738,Woodsman,2012-09-22 16:04:00,1286,Actually there is a separate EI fund which is in access of what is being paid out on EI claims. It is not a fund in individuals names but like any insurance a large fund of the whole which pays out the claims. The government has been known in the past to raid this fund for other reasons when the surplus gets larger. There is no interest being charged on the the money due to lack of funds.
731744,Woodsman,2012-09-22 16:19:00,1286,Our national debt is a fact which costs us big interest. This I agree with. The EI fund is not part of our national debt though and it's surpluses have been siphoned off in the past to service the national debt.
731746,Woodsman,2012-09-22 16:32:00,1286,"Not at all. Although I have not seen the actual contract the was in use before the lock out I have seen many in the past. Every contract I've ever seen included a clause to the effect of ""after the expiration date of this contract it will remain in effect unless either party notifies the other of their intention to cancel the existing contract"". This is what the NHL owners have done. The players were abiding by their existing contract so in no why did they refuse to work. The owners chose to stop the work (season)."
730152,danc,2012-09-16 03:16:00,4677," I hope that you're putting $300.00 a week away to realize what I already have done. That's a mortgage payment Bud. I never had to worry about it. It was paid above my weekly wages and not a deduction to my wages. That,s called a fully funded pension. You have 35 years to go? Good luck. I love how kids these days have everything figured out when they're so young. Get back to me in 35 years and let me know how it went."
730158,danc,2012-09-16 03:41:00,4677," Maybe I could have. But I've seen the time and stress that owning a business has put on my employers. A union working wage is enough for me. I'm not into the making more money thing. Just paying my bills and having some extra cash to do a few other things is good enough for me. This summer alone I went to a huge country music festival in Minnesota, went on a fly in fishing trip, and next month I'm going to Kansas City for a NASCAR race. Throw in a couple of fishing trips to Lake Nipigon. That's enough fun for me in a year. Oh. And I'm retiring at age 58 in a few years too. Tell me. What were the highlights of your year?"
730161,danc,2012-09-16 03:53:00,4677," Wow. You're 30? I would have guessed 22. So, at age 30, surely you have at least 15 grand per year pension built up by age 55? If not, you have some catching up to do. By the way. I'm only 54."

Especially given the players are the only reason people spend any money on the NHL at all. Personally I think the should just have a cap increase freeze until the revenue split is 50-50. Then increase the cap accordingly maintaining the 50-50 split.  That would mean no roll back. The Owners can start to increase there percentage of profit, and everyone goes back to playing hockey."

Analysis: The most unnecessary lockout of them all  DAVID SHOALTS The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Sep. 17 2012, 9:11 AM EDT Last updated Monday, Sep. 17 2012, 10:57 AM EDT   Now that Gary Bettman and the NHL owners marked their irrelevant deadline by locking out the players on Saturday, all eyes turn to the next step.  Well, the league already took the next step with that ridiculous statement it issued following the lockout but more on that in a minute.  The really big next step, one that actually produces progress, is going to take some time. After all, the great deadline of Sept. 15 declared by the NHL commissioner only marked the expiry of the collective agreement, not the start of the season or even the start of training camps. No one in this mess will be inclined to get serious about labour negotiations until pay cheques and gate receipts are missed, which is almost four weeks away.  There is no reason for NHL Players' Association executive director Donald Fehr and the players to do anything right now. They know they have the moral high ground and are, for a change, winning the public relations battle. And the league is doing nothing except shooting itself in both feet right now with Sunday's statement as Exhibit A.  First of all, the NHL seems to be the only business in the world that thinks the expiry of a labour agreement means business must cease. This is the fourth time since 1992 the league ceased operations due to a labour dispute and it is the third time the owners locked out the players, all three of them coming on Gary Bettman's watch.  Where every other business carries on operations while a new labour agreement is being negotiated, with both labour and management rightly regarding a strike or lockout as the absolute last resort, Bettman and his chief labour strategist, outside counsel Bob Batterman, rush to lock the doors. As Ansar Khan of MichiganLive.com noted, the NHL has now lost 1,698 regular-season games due to labour disputes since 1992. That is more than Major League Baseball (938), the NBA (504) and the NFL (0) combined.  This is the most unnecessary lockout of them all. It is not about fighting for a new way of doing business like the last one. It is merely about how to slice up a billion-dollar pie.  Funny thing, though. You might think with all that practice Bettman and the owners would be a little smoother at trying to pull the wool over the fans' eyes. It was bad enough they spent the months leading up to the lockout bragging about record revenues in the seven years since the last lockout that saw the NHL grow from a $2.1-billion (all currency U.S.) business to a $3.3-billion one only to plead poverty a few days later. Not only that, one of the guys at the table demanding the players take a 24-per-cent pay cut because the salary cap system they demanded and won after an entire season was lost in 2004-05 is now not working, Minnesota Wild owner Craig Leipold, was fresh from signing two good but not great players to 13-year contracts worth $98-million each.  No, only these guys could compound that with the statement the league issued Sunday after it locked out the players: ""This is a time of year for all attention to be focused on the ice, not on a meeting room. The league, the clubs and the players all have a stake in resolving our bargaining issues appropriately and getting the puck dropped as soon as possible. We owe it to each other, to the game and, most of all, to the fans.""  Yes, that really was issued by the NHL public-relations department. It did not come from The Onion or any other satirical outlet.  No, the NHL owners really aren't that stupid. They're just not afraid of the fans. They don't even respect them. In their eyes, the fans are simply ATMs with arms and legs. They came back last time, the owners believe, and they'll come back this time, once we've rooted through the players' pockets for every nickel."
730543,jedimaster,2012-09-17 17:59:00,3472,"Yep I agree, they don't care, and they haven't learned.  Nothing will change for any of the owners. I think 5 teams should just get cancelled  2 could be relocated to quebec and markham/hamilton/KW and be done with it."
730553,Stoty,2012-09-17 18:57:00,2910," Agreed!  Or simply move all 5 to Canada....but the tiny bodied, big-eared American that runs the league would never go for that, even though he would make A LOT MORE money if he did.  Screw the LOCKOUT.... Bettman needs to be KNOCKED OUT!"

728448,kickingfrog,2012-09-09 00:31:00,8333,"Yes and no.  In general most players under contract will not be payed. In a normal season they don't start to get paid until the regular season starts. In other words: The players don't start missing salary cheques until middle of October if there is a lock-out.  Some players have contracts that pay them bonuses in the summer. Some of these bonuses were put in contract offers by general managers to make the contract more difficult for other teams to match. The Flyers offer sheet for Weber this summer has such.  Some of the younger players can play in the ahl or chl and still get paid. Some of those deals would have a reduced salery (2 way contract) Higher drafted/better players are less likely to have 2 way deals.  The players who contributed to the escrow account last season will get most of the 10-12% (that they paid into it from their salary) in early October whether the players are locked-out or not.   Edit to add:  Wade Redden, who has been down in the minors for the Rangers for the last 2 (3?) years because the team that signed him, didn't want the cap hit will get paid 5 million dollars this year and 5 more next year playing for the Wolfpack."

728676,jedimaster,2012-09-10 15:22:00,3472,"Talked to an NHL'r this weekend, and if you're contract expires at the end of this season it doesn't get extended until the next one. P.S. he said its likely to be a lockout. The players wanted to play under the current deal until a new CBA got negotiated. It should be mentioned that every team(short of 3) were profitable last year. Clearly This is a LOCKOUT and not a strike. This has nothing to do with anything other than the @sshats at the league wanting to scrap the season to put more money in there pockets.  He said that if there is a lockout he is gonna go to play in europe and most guys he talked to will also go play in europe. If they lock the players out he will miss out on his last year of his contract and will come back as a UFA. I told him to play for the leafs when he comes back so he can get me tickets. haha. Plus I think he would be a great fit for the Blue and White. AND he LOVES to fish. Serious hard core bass guy."

729985,kickingfrog,2012-09-15 14:38:00,8333,"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/league-and-players-are-fighting-in-an-age-of-disagreement/article4543964/   League and players are fighting in an age of disagreement  KEN DRYDEN Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Sep. 13 2012, 7:13 PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Sep. 13 2012, 8:33 PM EDT   For years, from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, Gary Bettman kept searching for an answer he couldn’t find. With no salary cap, the NHL teams that could spend, including the New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings and Philadelphia Flyers, did. But many teams that couldn’t spend, including teams in smaller markets, more southern U.S. cities and Canadian teams, except Toronto and Montreal, overwhelmed by a 70-cent Canadian dollar, also spent to a point beyond what their revenues would support. In NHL governors’ meetings, Bettman would point this out, at first forcefully, over time as if possessed.  He presented elaborate charts: Here’s what the league and individual teams take in, here’s what we spend. It makes no sense. Here’s what winning teams spend, here’s what losing teams spend. There’s no correlation between spending and performance (there was, in fact, some correlation). It makes no sense.  He would run a roll call of teams, and one by one take team owners, with all their private business splashed up on a big screen for everyone to see, to the principal’s office. Here’s what you’re doing – you idiot – here are the results you’re getting – you moron – and, always prefaced by the anti-trust defeating phrase, “Of course, you have the right, as everyone does, to make any decision you want” – what are you going to do in the future – you total fool.  To get out of the principal’s office, team owners learned to respond as if at an AA meeting.  “Hi, I’m Bob, and I’m a spend-aholic.”  “Hi Bob.”  Bettman’s buildup would continue each year until free-agent day – July 1. This year would be different. Then on July 1, all hell broke loose. Bob, as well as Dick and Harry, spent his brains out again.  Mutual support and individual humiliation weren’t working. Bettman’s response was to generate more and worse of the same. But each year, he got the same result. It was suggested to him that his approach didn’t work and would never work because many owners had a logic that overrode even financial success. Owners are competitive people, as players are. Owners want to win, as players do. But a player who wants to win, as a free agent, can go to five or six teams, playing each team against the others to drive up the money he seeks. An owner has no place else to go. An owner has to win where he is. When a player he thinks he needs to win sets to leave, he runs after him. An owner’s addiction isn’t chemical, it’s to his own self-image.  Every several years a collective agreement between the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association expires and a new one needs to be negotiated. If owners couldn’t restrain themselves, Bettman knew they needed a collective agreement that would do that for them. Bob Goodenow, head of the NHLPA, naturally, wasn’t looking to co-operate. Goodenow knew these rich, tough owners were actually weak. All he needed was to say “no” to every proposal. Eventually they would cave. And they did.  Finally, Bettman realized they always would. The only way for the owners and for him to win was to take the power out of the owners’ hands. He couldn’t do that directly. He was their employee.  He had to get their support to change the NHL bylaws so that a higher percentage of team owners were required to override any proposed agreement with the NHLPA he brought to them. Then he’d need the support of only a few friendly owners, and the negotiations were his. He got the bylaws changed.  Bettman girded himself for the 2004 negotiation, month by month building up in himself a belief in the rightness of his position, in the wrongness of the players’ position, and a solid dislike of Goodenow. And this time he had the power.  Goodenow said “no” as he always did. The owners locked out the players. The season didn’t start. Goodenow said “no” again and again. The owners would cave. Bettman didn’t. Goodenow had no other strategy. Goodenow needed the players. Bettman didn’t need the owners. It became Bettman against the players. The players caved.  The NHLPA disintegrated. Goodenow left. Infighting among players and their agents produced warring factions, new heads and acting heads of the NHLPA, and a mess. Finally, Donald Fehr, former long-time head of baseball’s players union, by far the most effective and respected of North America’s professional sports players unions, agreed to be the NHLPA’s head. And now here we are. The collective agreement expires at midnight Saturday. The sides seem nowhere near an agreement.  The owners and players both want an NHL of 30 teams because owners have made big investments in those 30 teams and because players want the jobs those 30 teams provide. Some teams are financially weaker. To survive, they need help. The owners want the players to give up more of what they have to see that these teams make it. The players want the owners, especially richer owners, to give up more of what they have to do the same. So the biggest fight between them is over what percentage of league revenues should go to the owners and what to the players, and what constitutes “league revenues.”  The fact is, both the owners and players are doing relatively fine. Their fight is not one of economic necessity. Bettman needs to win because he won last time, and he’s a winner. The players need to win because they lost last time and have to prove they’re not losers. The two sides didn’t really start to negotiate until July because there wasn’t much to talk about, and because for each to win what he needed to win, neither could agree before the collective agreement expired. There’s no agreement because neither needs an agreement. It’s not a fight they need to have. They fight because they can.  There’s something not quite right about this. Others are affected. It’s not obvious that a fan will be better off if the owners win, or the players win, no matter what Bettman or Fehr argue. Fans want their game. They pay for their game – steeply – but a price they accept to pay.  Eight years ago the NHL lost a full season. The fans could have developed new interests. Old hockey-viewing habits might have been broken. But the fans came back in even greater numbers and paid even higher prices. Bettman says the NHL has the “world’s best fans,” and maybe he’s right. But is it necessary that they prove it? Might love and loyalty not be paid back a different way? Or is this just the way things are: a strike or lockout every number of years, an 11th-hour season-saving deal, then two-thirds of a season of games crammed into a half-season of days, and critically, a full playoffs to try to make everyone forget?  We have become better and better at difference. We hire more experts to push our own case. It’s their job to win, their only job. Nothing else matters. It’s black and white, winning and losing, winners and losers. Grey is boring. Conviction is good. Compromise is weak. Compromisers are spineless. The media decide what’s worthy of attention. The media love difference. There’s drama in difference, drama in conflict. There is no bigger interest. There are only interests.  So we fight for as much as we can get.  What are the losers – the fans – to do? They could try to stand up together, develop a strategy, stay home from games. As unlikely as that is, big surprises happen, and the strong are never as strong as they seem.  Or the players and owners might say, this is going nowhere good. The way we live isn’t about total victory, about being the only one left standing, the only one who wins. An economy, a society, politics, sports don’t work if only a few win. With no overwhelming issues, NHL owners and players have agreed to disagree.  They need to learn how to agree to agree."

These teams are spare time, spare money operations for the most part. Nobody forced anyone to buy-in. Nobody forced them to sign the big contracts.  For the most part you can swap out the name of the owner/city and repeat this in most of the papers in that have nhl teams that have or are looking for new arenas. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/edmonton-city-council-rejects-oilers-bid-for-more-taxpayer-dollars-for-arena/article4540405/    Edmonton city council rejects Oilers bid for more taxpayer dollars for arena DEAN BENNETT EDMONTON — The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, Sep. 12 2012, 3:36 PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Sep. 12 2012, 6:10 PM EDT  A new downtown arena for the Edmonton Oilers hit the ditch Wednesday as city councillors rejected a bid by the NHL team for more money from taxpayers.  Mayor Stephen Mandel would not say how much was asked for, or what is was for, but said the ball is now in the court of the team’s owner, pharmacy billionaire Daryl Katz.  “Optimistic might not be the best word,” Mandel said.  “Frustrated might be a better word. But I’m optimistic in the sense (we can) get back together and see how we can make this work.”  Construction on the $450-million arena is slated to begin early next year.  Mandel said the request from the Katz Group did not come with an ultimatum, although Katz has said the Oilers won’t play indefinitely at their current home of Rexall Place in Edmonton’s north end.  The Katz Group, responding to council’s decision through a prepared statement, said it has become clear during the design and engineering process that the $450-million cap won’t be enough to build the “iconic” structure that both the city and the Oilers want.  John Karvellas, executive vice-president of the Katz Group, didn’t say what the revised cost would be, but said the Oilers would pay their fair share for any costs over the $450 million.  Karvellas said they have already gone above and beyond expectations by spending $70 million to date.  “We have made these investments of time and money in good faith and without regret and continue to believe this project can and must succeed,” he said in the statement.  Mandel and the councillors rejected the Katz request Wednesday morning after debating it behind closed doors.  Their decision comes almost a year after the Katz Group and the city agreed in principle on a cost-shared deal for the rink, which included a maximum cost of $450 million.  Mandel said council voted to keep that original agreement in place.  “In my opinion (it’s) a very good deal for all parties to keep sustainable, strong, great NHL hockey here,” said Mandel.  Councillor Kim Krushell, a longtime supporter of the project, was asked if council was “blindsided” by the Katz Group request for extra funds.  “I would characterize it that I was surprised. That’s about all I will say,” Krushell said.  The deal for the new rink has led to sharp and heated debate in the Alberta capital.  Proponents say public money for this private venture will lead to economic spinoff benefits, a revitalized downtown core, and a higher international profile.  Critics say no public money should go toward a private venture.  A third group says it can see a role for public money, but says the deal struck is too lopsided in favour of the Oilers.  Under the agreed terms, city taxpayers will put up $125 million to go with $100 million by the Katz Group. A ticket tax ($5-$6 a ticket) would pay for another $125 million.  Another $100 million is being sought from the province, although Premier Alison Redford’s government is adamant no tax dollars will go to private ventures.  Mandel said that they’re getting closer to solving that problem.  “We’ve been working with the province on various programs and we believe they’re getting close to coming up with a solution that would deal with the realities of every town and village and city ... coming up with funds for facilities like the arena project,” he said.  Council has already been told that the city’s ultimate contribution will far exceed $125 million.  Officials estimate that when borrowing and land purchase costs are factored in, the number becomes $305 million. Another $57 million will be spent for a light-rail transit extension to the rink, a pedestrian corridor and an above-ground walkway over the main avenue in front of the building.  A proposed community rink would add another $21 million. The city would also pay Katz $20 million over 10 years to advertise through his team. It’s not clear what form that advertising would take.  The base number itself is already rising.  In July, councillors were told revised estimates have boosted the original $450-million figure to $485 million, prompting designers to look at ways to cut back on some of the amenities, like some of the concession stands and the Oilers retail store.  The Oilers would pay their $100 million in instalments: $5.5 million in annual rent for 35 years, plus interest, for a total of $186 million.  The team would pay to operate the building and keep the profits for 11 months out of the year.  Katz would retain the naming rights for the building. Comparable estimates put that at $1 million a year.  The deal would bind the team to staying in Edmonton for the next 35 years.  The proposed rink is a futuristic structure of wavy lines and curves done over in zinc, masonry and glass in the broad shape of an oil drop.  There would by 18,400 seats along with clubs and bistros, even a space to hold beach volleyball tournaments, along with underground parking.  The city is banking that the arena will be a catalyst for more retail and housing.  The rink would replace the aging Rexall Place, which has been the home of the Oilers since their World Hockey Association days of the 1970s.  Built in 1974, it’s the second-oldest rink in the NHL. The oldest is the arena where the New York Islanders play.  The Oilers are the only NHL team that doesn’t get non-hockey-related revenue from its building."

The owners said they wont play without a new CBA. Case closed. The season won't start on time, neither the players nor the owners, nor bettman cares what may seem logical.

If they were advocating cheaper tickets at the gate , i might have some sympathy. But theyre not and I dont.  Dont get me wrong. The owners are absolutely swimming in money and i have none for them either.

726873,kickingfrog,2012-09-03 15:11:00,8333,"http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-elliott-nhl-labor-20120902,0,6653644.column   NHL good at getting labor negotiations wrong By Helene Elliott September 1, 2012, 6:35 p.m.  ""I know the league's future is bright, and this will be to the benefit of the game. We had no choice but to get it right."" — NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, July 22, 2005, announcing the labor deal that ended a season-long lockout.  Whoops…. Maybe Bettman and the owners who authorized him to cancel the 2004-05 season didn't get it right after all.  The collective bargaining agreement they negotiated with the NHL Players' Assn. expires Sept. 15, and the league is again pushing hard for substantial givebacks by players. No new deal, no new season, Bettman has decreed, leaving the hockey world to face the third league-imposed lockout since 1994.  It figures: The Kings waited 44 years to win the Stanley Cup and the NHL will implode before they can raise their banner.  This dispute was predictable the moment the NBA and NFL won concessions that dropped players' salaries to 47% of agreed-upon revenues in the case of the NFL and to 50% in the case of the NBA. The NHL, which navigated the recession surprisingly well and generated $3.3 billion in revenues last season, wants to change an equation that favored players by 57%-43% and make it 54%-46% in the owners' favor.  The cut actually goes deeper because the NHL, citing higher business costs, wants to exclude some currently accepted hockey-related revenues from what players would share in the next deal. If business is booming why shouldn't players share the bounty? The 57% share they want in the fourth year of their proposal is probably a bit high, but the NHL's offer of 46% of a smaller pie is too low.  ""We need to be paying out less in player costs."" — Bettman, Aug. 9, 2012.  Maybe so. But who told the New Jersey Devils to overbid for winger Ilya Kovalchuk, offering a 17-year deal that was reworked to $100 million over 15 years? How could the small-market Minnesota Wild afford to sign free agents Ryan Suter and Zach Parise to identical 13-year, $98-million deals in June?  The ink on that ""get it right"" labor deal hadn't dried before general managers found ways to shred it, principally with front-loaded, long-term contracts that reduced the average annual value and salary-cap hit. Another escalating factor has been the huge jump players are taking from their entry-level deals to their second contracts. That rising tide brought other boats up with it.  The seven Canadian teams, helped by their dollar's increased strength and the NHL's return to Winnipeg, continue to account for about one-third of ticket revenues in a still heavily gate-driven league. The Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens will always be pillars of strength, but one small downturn in the value of the Canadian dollar could create havoc.  While Bettman is fond of pointing out that the NHL has increased its revenues from $2.2 billion before the current labor agreement to $3.3 billion, he's less fond of discussing the franchise values of some unprofitable small-market teams.  In a story dated November, 30 2011, Forbes reported that Bettman had said three years earlier that no NHL franchise was worth less than $200 million. However, since then the Buffalo Sabres were sold for $165 million (plus debts), the St. Louis Blues sold for about $130 million and the Phoenix Coyotes' sale has become a sad, strung-out saga. Former San Jose Sharks executive Greg Jamison has had trouble assembling the financing to meet the $170-million price tag the NHL set for the Coyotes, whom it has operated for nearly three years. Large-market teams are strong, but smaller markets struggle to operate profitably while meeting the rising salary floor, and they've gotten little help through revenue sharing.  That made it comical when Bettman last Friday dismissed the NHLPA's insistence on discussing revenue sharing as ""distracting."" In truth, he's trying to placate powerful big-market owners who don't want to share much with their small-market brothers. It's clear several markets added through the NHL's over-reaching expansion — and others that have been mismanaged — are causing problems owners won't solve on their own, making lockout threats a certainty each time a labor deal expires.  ""I hope it never happens again. We're both going to kill each other if we do it again."" — Mike Gartner, then the NHLPA's director of business relations, on losing a season to a lockout, July 21, 2005.  Sorry, but it looks like deja vu all over again. ""We recovered last time because we have the world's greatest fans,"" Bettman said Aug. 23, and with reason. He has two advantages: Hockey remains best seen in rinks rather than on TV, and he knows fans' bottomless passion will bring them back.  Whatever happens over the next two weeks fans will return, sadder but wiser. For the moment, they're just sad this is happening again without much apparent chance of a long-term solution.

The owners want a socialized system of paying the players, while not sharing the revenue amongst themselves. Hypocrites.  The owners have never once had someone pay a $120 to watch them work. Who would watch an old saggy azzed white guy sit on his butt and find more ways to not pay his taxes?  The owners said they needed cost certainly and that ticket prices would go down if there was a cap. They got it and it didn't.  Every beer league bozzo says that they would play for free. blah blah blah Easy to say when you own family won't watch you play for free.  Imagine how it would go over if your company was making money hand over fist and they came to you and said ""We're going to take 24% of your salary."" And we are going to reduce your opportunity to make money in the future even though you are the sole reason we make any money.   We can shake our head all we want and say they make too much money but they only get paid what the market will bear, well almost, since the owners have a cap.
