731563,Harrison,2012-09-21 15:27:00,2202,"Gents, are we still allowed to fish from the City shoreline? If so, below  is a shot from my new office for while.  Is it worth the walk down to the area pictured and have a looksee for myself for ""allowable"" fishing water or should I head east/west?    And for the CN tower fans, pretty cool view.  "
731566,Christopheraaron,2012-09-21 15:42:00,3525,Not sure but the islands are very nice.
731586,mepps,2012-09-21 17:18:00,1301,"You sure can! Keep away from boats and marinas though! Dont forget the net, some of the walls are pretty high!"
731718,ehg,2012-09-22 14:25:00,2666,"They did put ""No Fishing"" signs up but they were taken down and by-law was changed to encourage fishing there.  Seems all the Toronto pike anglers have disappeared from this board. 6-8 yrs. ago there was a bunch like FHR, Highdrifter, Snag etc... the fish are still there. Late March is best time using deep diving X-Raps, Husky Jerk, etc... still worth try anytime."
731850,ttahhan,2012-09-23 01:18:00,191,In recent years I have heard a lot about the great fishing in and around these islands. You can either come over on the ferry or get into the canals with your own boat to try your luck at the largemouth bass and pike that call this place home. Fishing here offers a unique experience as you can see the Toronto skyline while you are pulling in some monsters. There was No Fishing Allowed Anywhere But as Of June 12 2012 The Ban Has Been Lifted Fishing is now again encouraged and allowed. Here's also the area map and jurisdictions just some extra info.

731924,tdotfisherman,2012-09-23 14:38:00,317,"The GTA has a wonderful Pike fishery. Lots of large, heathly Pike swimming around... Any opportunity you have to cast a line for Pike I would recommend doing it. I'm going out this week for some Lake O Pike, I'll let you all know how it went..   *Update 3 days later: was skunked, lol. Conditions sucked, 1 pike follow, no pike on.."
732040,Ralph Field,2012-09-23 23:53:00,1018,You are allowed to fish the Harbour front . Some anglers fish there regularly and post many pictures of the pike that they catch.
