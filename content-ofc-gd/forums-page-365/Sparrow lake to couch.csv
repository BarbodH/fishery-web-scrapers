731719,fisherman7,2012-09-22 14:31:00,325, The severn river from the bottom of Sparrow past the locks to the top of Couch is speed controled at 10kph. I do this a fair bit in my cruiser so you should count on at least 40 minutes of travel time plus whatever it takes to get through the locks. Good thing is that at this time of year the locks are very quiet. We went through last week back and forth and was only one other boat in the locks.
