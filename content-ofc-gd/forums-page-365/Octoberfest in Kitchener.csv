731550,Lunker777,2012-09-21 14:48:00,866,Hey everyone  October 12-13-14 weekend we are throwing a bachelor party for friend. I'm the best man.... we were going to pull the trigger and head to Chicago for the weekend. but we can't seem to gather everyone up due to $$$.  So it turns out Oktoberfest is that weekend and we were thinking that might be a good time . Head down for the day and then hit up some bars at night haha  Would it be the type of event for a bachelor party ?  We don't want to do the typical drunk fest/strip bar night....
731551,Christopheraaron,2012-09-21 14:52:00,3525,"If that's not what you want then don't go. Also it's spelt Oktoberfest, probably named by a couple drunks. LOL!"
731589,ironstone74,2012-09-21 17:32:00,201,"Try to get tickets for the hall at Concordia Club on Ottawa street.  It's a massive tent structure with live bands, bikini dunk tank, excellent German food, games, ladies...  It's a blast and would be great for a bachelor party!"
731591,craigdritchie,2012-09-21 17:36:00,1586,"Been to the real Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. It isn't cheap, but it truly is the ultimate experience every man needs to have at some point in his life. No exceptions! Just Google 'Oktoberfest photos' to see why.  By the way, the name comes from its German origins, where 'October' is spelled 'Oktober.'  So it was probably named that way by drunk Germans."
731636,spincast,2012-09-21 22:50:00,3279,"I remember going several times; Only remember leaving a few.  But I was much younger then.  It is expensive and it is a beer and sausage celebration - so plan (and dress) accordingly. Take a bunch of freinds and its  a lot of fun (the first few times anyway).  If you are from out of town - book a hotel. Take  a cab to the event that way the only  way home is to cab or walk. The alternative is  a different accomodation for the evening, which from the papers appears to be quite full."
731662,kickingfrog,2012-09-22 02:11:00,8333,My wife went to Laurier when we were dating. I've been told I had a great time.
731671,Dutch,2012-09-22 02:47:00,831,"Yes, I was there in University.  All I can remember is that I'm glad I wrote the address of the place I was staying down on a piece of paper to hand the cab driver."
731683,Toad Hunter,2012-09-22 05:38:00,261,"I live in kitchener, been many times, but as for concordia club, it will be $$ trying to find tickets this late. But plenty of other options all over the city."
731694,kickingfrog,2012-09-22 11:40:00,8333,"My wife has a great sense of humour, you should mention that if you interview with her company."
731918,LimbLifter,2012-09-23 14:13:00,27,Too busy and too many drunk drivers.....
732070,Cudz,2012-09-24 02:26:00,2652,"I went to UW and spent a number of nights at the high school down the street (WLU). Lots to do but you do need to get tickets asap if you are going to do this.  THere are several big event areas, best to choose one. You basically go to one event each night.  Don't try to do more."
732122,Lunker777,2012-09-24 13:00:00,866,I found some tickets to the concordia Club for Saturday the 13th. Would that be worth the trip or what ?
732126,Joey,2012-09-24 13:20:00,9122,"I think it would Lunker, I've seen some photo's from it and know some people who went there and it looks like a complete blast.  Take a cab from your hotel tho, then no temptation to drive!  Have fun"
732135,troutologist,2012-09-24 14:20:00,951,Buses used to be free in the evenings. Good times to be had.  Don't build a tower of empty beer cups it will cause problems.
