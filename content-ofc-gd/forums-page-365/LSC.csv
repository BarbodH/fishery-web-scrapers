731573,mistaredone,2012-09-21 16:20:00,913,I'm on the fence about fishing Kawarthas or LSC this weekend. The Weather is much better at LSC but I'm not sure if the wind will be too much for my 16' bass boat?  I checked modis and the lake seem pretty dirty as of yesterday so my plan B of hiding from the wind on the Detriot might be out?  Would Mitchell's bay be protected from the west wind?  Any skis in the bay or are they out deeper this time of year?  Thanks

It's a west wind which means it has the whole lake to build.  I've heard the musky have started to move into the Thames which would be much nicer to fish. If its bass you are after, there are a few channels by the Thames where the largemouth bass have started to move into according to some reports.  I am going over this same debate myself, I want to get out on LSC tomorrow but I think it will be constrained to the river and channels given the wind."
