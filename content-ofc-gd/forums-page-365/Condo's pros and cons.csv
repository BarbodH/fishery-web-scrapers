I have someone cut grass etc., I have a snow removal contract and I manage some money for major repairs.  Nothing better than coming home and watching someone do my yard work, while I light the BBQ and have a beer. When I explained it to some, they said they wished they never moved.  Just my take on the topic. Hahaha"
