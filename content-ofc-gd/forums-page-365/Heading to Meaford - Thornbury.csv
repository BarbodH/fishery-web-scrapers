730770,STJ,2012-09-18 15:10:00,12,Heading up to Meaford for a few days. Just wondering if much has been going on? Any news? I will post on Friday how we did on our outing. Thanks

730944,Fisherman,2012-09-18 23:46:00,7201,Maybe he's going to buy some fish at Valu-Mart
730954,STJ,2012-09-19 00:19:00,12,"I am sorry guy's, allow me to rephrase.  I may be traveling in the general direction towards the southern portion of Georgian Bay. At said time I may be inclined to take part in the ancient art of angling. If someone else has had such a desire and would share a humorous antic dote it would be appreciated. If not so be it, I would be happy to add another comment to the forum upon my return.  Many Thanks  STJ  "

731024,misfish,2012-09-19 09:38:00,29133,"Lots of heavy rain here yesterday and over night. Locally,it,s blown,but never know up there. More rain called for thursday friday."
731109,FrankTheRabbit,2012-09-19 15:54:00,479,"There's no fish in them waters, but no fish for sure if you end up staying at home."
731171,davey buoy,2012-09-19 19:48:00,5505,"Heard on Sunday,little bit of a slow start so I'm hearing."
731467,STJ,2012-09-21 00:18:00,12,"Just back, weather was not on our side but we managed two bows in the 3 lb range. I will return."
731490,SirCranksalot,2012-09-21 01:42:00,3291,I understand that salmon and bows run a bit later in the Bighead than other area rivers.
731622,misfish,2012-09-21 21:00:00,29133," Yes you are correct. Once the trib keeper,s clicker hits a  number,the gates are closed, and they move on north,to the next trib.Where another trib keeper is waiting. Once that trib has reached it,s count,the gate is closed,and off they swim to the next. By the time they get to the Big Head,they are dead tired.  "
