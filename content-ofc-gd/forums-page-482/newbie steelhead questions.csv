627956,northernpike56,2011-10-05 05:30:00,717,"I have been hearing about trout fishing and I think I would like to try some of that this winter.  1. What type of rod, reel, and line should I be using?  2. Do trout start decomposing when they spawn like salmon or can they spawn multiple times?  3. Would it be safe to eat the trout out of Lake Ontario?  4. What lures should I be using?  Thanks,  Matt."
627970,ccmtcanada,2011-10-05 10:55:00,7971, Good luck Matt!!  Lots of reading material out there on the web too..do as much research as you can!
627990,BillM,2011-10-05 12:53:00,17367,"If you are going to be casting off the piers, you'd be better off to wait until the spring (Or get down there right now!)"
627998,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-05 13:23:00,2690,"The only thing I would add, is for chucking hardware...if you can afford it, go out and buy yourself a medium action rod between 8-10 ft.  You WILL appreciate it not only for ease of fighting the fish, but, also for distance on your casts. Doesn't have to be expensive, plenty of good rods in the $60-100 range for pier chucking. Good luck."
628005,BillM,2011-10-05 13:45:00,17367,"Good advice Frank, for pier chucking the 10' Shimano Convergence (which is about $70) is a great stick.  Combine that with a 2500 Series reel and you are set."
628014,12footspringbok,2011-10-05 14:15:00,459,"Pier fishing for rainbows should be getting good right now, and it should be good right up until december when the water cools significantly and the fish become less active. Although I know you can catch them all winter, best bet for that is roe still fished though. Best days to cast from shore at this time of year are often the days you don't wanna be out there, a strong onshore wind almost always means action up here on Gbay.  There is no tips or tricks better than plain old practice and experience. Just get down there as much as you can even if you're the only one there."
628015,beginner,2011-10-05 14:15:00,542,"I just bought the new convergence, 83 bucks in le baron... Its good for far casting, I used it from bass, pike, walleye, trout, salmon or almost everything... cant go wrong with the price too... gudluck in your steelie"
