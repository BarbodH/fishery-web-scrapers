627353,misfish,2011-10-03 19:34:00,29133,"Got the recall in the mail today. Apparently they have an issue with the tank straps rottening out. They will replace with new. I had mine done 2.5 years ago because of this . Ford says they will reimburse (with an invoice provided) Heres one of those times I wish I had not paid cash for the work and straps.  Im still going to take it in,as to make sure these ones are ok."
627383,lew,2011-10-03 20:27:00,12766,Pretty sure that recall is for older 150's Brian but I may be wrong on that too.
627394,misfish,2011-10-03 20:44:00,29133,Yep Lew.And mines one of them
627421,johnl,2011-10-03 21:46:00,197,My gas tank fell while i was driving down the road two weekends ago!Ford fixed the straps and put on a new tank because it was damaged free of charge.It was a shock to me and it ended me and my gf's fishing trip pretty quick.
627423,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 21:49:00,5865,And you would have thought Ford would have learned after the 1970's Pinto fiasco....
627427,irishfield,2011-10-03 21:52:00,26272,Come'on Billy Bob... everyone knows that Pintos only blew up when hit from behind when they had their left signal light on!
627430,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 21:57:00,5865,But everyone know's the Ford Pinto's turn signals were problematic and rarely worked...LOL  I actually had a 1980 Pinto wagon for about 10 years....never a problem until it started to leak oil...if it wasn't for that I might still have that little beast...
627433,irishfield,2011-10-03 22:05:00,26272,"I had no problem with the one I had when I was 16/17 either, after I pulled the 4 banger and shoed in a 302 that is !"
627450,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 22:21:00,5865,"Oh, what year...was it a Boss 302 ?"
627452,Ron,2011-10-03 22:22:00,1683,"Sure glad I traded in my 99 Ford JUNK for a Toyota! All I had to deal with was the mystical sticking gas pedal which was proven to be the fault of the drivers. Hmmm didn't seem to hear to much about the results of that court case. ha ha ha  Cheers, Ron..."
627471,davey buoy,2011-10-03 22:42:00,5505,"Is it just the pick ups Brian?or other makes,models,years. davey"
