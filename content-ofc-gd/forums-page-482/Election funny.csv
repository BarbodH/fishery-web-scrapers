Both of her parents, stuanch NPD'ers, were standing there, so I asked her, If you were Prime Minister what would be the first thing you would do?  She replied, Id give food and houses to all the homeless people. Her parents beamed with pride.  Wow…what a worthy goal. I told her, But you dont have to wait until youre Prime Minister to do that! You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds, and trim my hedge, and Ill pay you $50. Then Ill take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.  She thought that over for a few seconds, then she looked me straight in the eye and asked, ' Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50? '  I said, Welcome to the Conservative Party. Her parents still aren't speaking to me."
