Now I should enlighten her and let her know it's only a so-so fish..................   Nah, my mother didn't raise any stupid kids."

627693,limeyangler,2011-10-04 14:31:00,5204,"In the world of internet....and particularly youtube.....the use of certain words like monster, huge, biggest....etc....is a tactic to get more views or 'hits'.  Those words are similarly used in forums to attract attention to posts(my opinion), but from my own point of view i am just as happy reading an interesting and/or informative and funny yet fishless report than one filled with BEHEMOTH BASS(insert air guitar and thrash metal soundtrack here).  Although giant fish are fun to catch and look at too"
627785,Djeep,2011-10-04 19:36:00,199,"Frame of reference is key in this discussion.  If you catch fish that are so big that looking at others prized accomplishments is a ""waste of time"" then you probably dont need this website for anything other than bragging.. I've learned a lot on this site, regardless of how big the catch in the thread was or the words used to describe it."

627806,Handlebarz,2011-10-04 21:06:00,3790,"  Ronnie you and I were thinking along the same lines I was wondering why this guy was hugging a 32"" musky??? must be the water where he lives.  I have a perch on the wall that is 13"" it is not a monster for what we have here on LSC or Erie but on lake X in sudbury area it sure was for where it came from it was in a area in the middle of this lake that was full of reeds I caught 13 pike off it and dad caught 8 then he caught the 13"" perch on crank bait we figure that it was a great memory for us and took it home what a great day it was we slammed the eye's saw a porcupine swimming followed a moose swimming and bashed the hell out of the pike that day dad was also bitten of by a HUGE pike to us at that time maybe 40""??? but that one perch means more to me then my first 50"" musky."

627918,Roy,2011-10-05 01:42:00,13728,OK. I think we've reached the end on this one. Repeating what everyone else has posted it pointless. I'm sure that there were some poor choices where words are concerned in this thread as well.

626778,Lungelarry,2011-10-01 13:24:00,294,"After seeing many posts about monsters,giants and even behemoths, I think  internet message boards needs a standard set of words to describ big fish. I know to everbody its different and one guys trophy is anothers dink, but come on,certain words should only be used IF it truly is a behemoth.I don,t mine if in your topic title you write,monster for this lake,but don,t put monster and its only a 48 in. muskie,cause its not even near being  a monster.Certain words are being tossed around much too easily these days.

626789,lew,2011-10-01 13:49:00,12766,"I got an 8 pound large mouth from the Kawarthas a few years back and for this area that really is an outstanding fish, even to a serious bass angler...which I'm not.  Many would have called it a monster, a giant or even a behemoth.  A tournament bass guy from southern Florida or Mexico would have called it a ho-hum fish and not given it a 2nd look.  Lotsa variables when describing a fish."
626794,muskymike,2011-10-01 14:17:00,772," You pulled the words right out of my mouth Terry. Well said.  If it's a monster to the guy who catches the fish, let him feel as good as he does. If you don't think its a monster, pass by the topic and move on.  We have to remember that no everyone has the opportunity to fish certain bodies of water where others are more privileged. Not everyone gets to fish x amount of hours.  I don't know why this would bother anyone. There are far better things on the winternet to complain about"
626798,danbouck,2011-10-01 14:29:00,4380,I will call it a monster if it's a monster to me.
626800,whitbyboatguy,2011-10-01 14:32:00,130,"It depends on who is saying it and where they are saying it.  A 16"" bass is caught -if a little kid is saying I caught a HUUUUGGGGEE bass I will agree with them and tell them. -if a guy that rarely fishes and is not a known jerk then it is pretty big or big for this lake. -if a blowhard says it then I either say nothing or laugh a little and shake my head or say it out right OR say it is big for this lake.    On the same topic when the walleye are on fire and the guys say they boated a tremendous 30 walleye. How does this compare to Limeangler's hauls? Does it make 30 a lesser number? Anyone going to say ""my buddy caught 150 in less time?"""
626813,Tybo,2011-10-01 15:15:00,1373,I have a 18lb Pickerel on the wall.What class would this fall into when I have caught alot of double digit Pickerel. Or is just a trophy fish since I still have a chance of catching a bigger one. I also believe in the eye of the beholder.  ART IS ONLY A BOYS NAME!

If it bothers someone to see the words Monster, behemoth, Pig, gigantic,used for so called mediocre fish, then maybe they aren""t enjoying the fishing as much as the competition."
626821,mike rousseau,2011-10-01 15:33:00,4661,  There are usualy quantity or quality...  Up north... Usualy quantity... So when guys like limy post about bigger then average walleye... Good for him...  I get walleye over 5lbs almost every time out... And small ones for me are 2lbs... So when someone like me posts about good numbers... Good for me...  The biggest thing is YouTube... Those titles are misleading... At least on the forum you can compare to the posters previous posts

In my case they are usually monsters (I often fish alone without a camera)."

627410,Lungelarry,2011-10-03 21:14:00,294,"Strange post...maybe. But with all the millions of words we have,why describe small and medium fish with the words that mean the biggest. Also I don,t mind if your TOPIC Title says"" big to me"" or ""big for this lake"",thats fine, but to say in your TOPIC TITLE monster,superdupper, than thats a lie and you wasted my time. Also what happens when one of you guys caught a REAL MONSTER,all the words have been used up,you will have to say you caught a SUPERDUPPER,whiter than white epic awsome fish...........and I would never ,ever poop on a childs ccatch,they are always great fish......you guys are adults"
627412,I'mHooked,2011-10-03 21:21:00,525,I guess it's all a matter of perspective. Live and let live.
627443,whitbyboatguy,2011-10-03 22:14:00,130,"I am going to take a guess at where this is coming from. This is not a bass, trout, walleye or even pike guy. This is a Musky guy.  They are almost the biggest and almost the meanest fish around here and since they are only share the top of their food chain there are not too many (oh those pesky Pike). When someone catches a decent sized musky when they are casual fisherman that usually catches other fish of course they are going to be excited and say it is huge because it is compared to the other fish they have caught.  I am not sure what the tarpon and marlin guys say about Musky. Maybe they say I had tarpon snap off many 1000lb rated hooks/line this season you call that 55lber a monster???    It comes with the territory....your stuck with it and the youtube juveniles ""must see"" videos."

Maybe you dont think so, but I DO. I think someone is just a bit cranky"
627476,Ron,2011-10-03 23:00:00,1683," Dude, you need to change your avatar. Got anything bigger to put up? Wait a minute, how about your MONSTER Muskie you caught, seriously!    Cheers, Ron..."
