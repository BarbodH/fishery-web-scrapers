627364,captpierre,2011-10-03 20:04:00,2521,Hey Guys.  Going to winterize my Yammy 115 4 Stroke this year myself for the first time. Which oil does one use?  Yamaha makes marine oil from the dealer but is a chunk more dough. Is it the preferred oil or can you use auto oil.  I wonder what the marinas use.

627422,Billy Bob,2011-10-03 21:46:00,5865,ANY oil that is approved as per spec's is good to go.....I have NEVER taken in any of my new vehicles or used so called manufactured oil to insure warranty...but I have always use the proper oil and kept said receipts just in case...and then only once did I have a engine fail on a GM product.....after 2 weeks of Bull they finally ponied up and repaired said vehicle....

Matter of fact you can get the information from the Yama website, viewable manuals, page 15 for oil recommendations.http://www.yamaha-motor.com/outboard/service/servicehome/home.aspx"
