Once the state is done milking the fish out, they become available for sale. Eggs too.  From an official press release on the Michigan government website: ""The DNR maintains multiple sites where fisheries biologists and technicians collect eggs and milt from chinook and coho salmon for use in the hatcheries. Fish in prime physical condition are made available to the public by American-Canadian Fisheries (ACF), a private vendor which assists the DNR with the salmon harvest."" They even list a bunch of places where you can go buy their unwanted salmon. Bring your own tartar sauce.  Click here for more info."

A couple I managed to hook into this fall cartwheeled twice in a row, tail-walked across river and came off even before I realized I needed to set the hook.LOL"
627485,John Bacon,2011-10-03 23:19:00,3277," The credit is still stocked with Coho's. This is through MEA, not the MNR. At this point we do not have permission to stock other rivers."
