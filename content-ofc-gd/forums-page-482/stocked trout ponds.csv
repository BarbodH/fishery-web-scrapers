627350,northernpike56,2011-10-03 19:28:00,717,Where can I go? Are the private ones still open?
627363,Big Cliff,2011-10-03 20:03:00,6899," You could try giving these guys a call, Kawartha Lakes Trout Farm 705-799-8040. I haven't been there in a long time but they use to keep their ponds well stocked year round. I know it is a bit of a drive but it is/was a nice place, three ponds, never crowded."
627371,Spiel,2011-10-03 20:13:00,9065," The areas you mentioned that are under direction of the regional conservation authorities follow the open/closed seasons for inland trout with respect to the FMZ that they're in. Private pay to fish ponds are exempt and set their own access times, days, weeks, months at their discression.  "

627691,cuzza,2011-10-04 14:27:00,467,Fish4Trout is definitely still open http://www.fish4trout.ca
627732,bassjnkie,2011-10-04 16:31:00,1101,The Ponds Trout Fishing Keswick is open weekends........905-473-5291
627778,northernpike56,2011-10-04 19:17:00,717,"i called 50 pont right now, the girl said theyre open until the end of november so I might try there or fish 4 trout depending on how much time I have"
627857,dave524,2011-10-04 23:10:00,4508," I'd double check that with some one in the know better than the girl on the gate that answered the phone, just because the park is open to the end of Nov. doesn't mean it is legal to fish trout in the pond. It would be zone 16 and the only trout pond I see listed that is open past the end of Sept closer is the Waterford Pond, pretty sure if any other ponds in zone 16 were open they would be listed specifically as well. That would be my take on reading the regs anyway  edit: private owned pay to fish ponds are another story, I was just referring to public Prov. fishing Areas."
