626704,docknocker,2011-10-01 01:21:00,36,"Thanks Ive seen this story several times(always sent to me) YES I am a Dog lover!!!(and it always brings a tear to my eye EVERY TIME dammit)  have an Old Golden retriever that I attained as the owner left him in the store. It went like this The guy comes in with this dog(shaking and scared)thought he was going to crap on the floor, Dog runs in crawls under my desk(I hadn't had the pleasure of a dogs company in many years) and missed it so... This is a New Car dealership. Guy yells at dog Dog shakes some more.. Guy says to dog, Fine you stay here then!! and leaves What to do??? Take Dog home? Old guy has been the best pal we ever had Gotta lift him into bed every night(his hips are hurting)but I don't mind Mine are too! Wifes Best Friend, she's at home all day too. He doesn't retrieve, he don't like to go for walks Wants no part of getting in a car for a ride(never went back where he came from) so the car means (to him) he's going away again! poor old guy is getting old, as am I. Brought us more joy in life than we could ever hope for! Guess things have a way of working out. We needed him and he decided he would be happy with us,,, Been about 7 years now Sorry to be so long winded.... But other Dog Lovers would understand... Thanks Again SteveO"
626754,southpaw24,2011-10-01 12:30:00,32," I want to buy you a beer now lol. I am also a huge dog lover, my wife and I have 2 golden retrievers, and have adopted another dog that her mother stole from us. It was half great pyrenese/something else just showed up at our house one day. We put signs up for a month around the area and a radio add for a bit as well. No-one ever claimed him so we were going to keep the big guy, but then my wifes parents golden died of cancer and they wanted another one, so she stole him from us."
