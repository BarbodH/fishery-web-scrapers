Wasn't really sure what to use for the roof?  Any ideas?  Hoping to keep it light.  Thanks,  lovetofish"

If so I would consider buying one since a good folding up one is going to be hard to make and take a lot of time.  If you are looking for something that doesn't fold up you have a lot of options.  Making the walls/roof out of tarp could make for some obnoxiously loud days if it's windy though.  The best small hut I have seen had a transparent roof, I assumed it was acrylic.   The guy let me in for a bit and it was hot in there!  Then again if you want to see better through the whole it's counterproductive.  I think if you were clear in your intentions a lot of people could help out.  How often are you going to be transporting it?  What are you transporting it with?  For how many people?"

The hut is 12'x7' the walls are made from 2x2, 2x4 and 1/4"" chip board.  ps.  I know what your talking about, about those windy days!!!  I was/am using a fold up hut that was made from tarp and plywood.  thanks,  lovetofish"
