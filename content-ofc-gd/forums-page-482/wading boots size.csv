627425,misfish,2011-10-03 21:51:00,29133,"14-15.  I was told to go 2 sizes.Im going to get one size down, as I find I am tripping over my feet with the 2 size up."
627426,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-03 21:51:00,4399,I would go plus 2.
627439,mike rousseau,2011-10-03 22:13:00,4661,well...  there arent many 15s  some 12 wide fit me... but im mostly a 13......
627440,solopaddler,2011-10-03 22:13:00,8605,Definitely 2 sizes larger.  You need waders with stocking feet large enough to accomodate a THICK pair of wool socks and not be too tight.  In turn you need wading boots large enough to accomodate the waders without being too tight.  If the boots are too tight your feet will freeze in cold water.  Unless all you do is fish in warm weather no way no how will boots one size larger cut it.
627441,BFSC Kevin,2011-10-03 22:14:00,1351,Depends. Some are already adjusted and recommends you to use your street shoes size
627444,mercman,2011-10-03 22:16:00,7054,  Sure its the boots doing that Brian
627449,registerfly,2011-10-03 22:21:00,198," Yes correct, you must double check with each manufacturer as more and more are adjusting their sizes to represent actual shoe size you would wear instead of going up. But 2 sizes was what I used and was perfect for 2 pairs of thick winter socks. Makes it harder to order online unless you have tried them on here 1st"
627469,mike rousseau,2011-10-03 22:41:00,4661,should i play it safe with these instead...?   http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=722183&categoryId=0&parentCategoryId=0&subCategoryId=0&indexId=0&itemGUID=cbf0218bac107053382cb2b01f8cc14d&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products&destination=/checkout/basket.jsp   5mm boot on waders... 800 gram insulation boot...  these would also double as duck hunting waders when i start doing that...
627481,dave524,2011-10-03 23:11:00,4508,"When it gets real cold I'm a fan of oversized bootfoot waders and if you are duck hunting, stockingfoot waders and wading shoes just don't do well in black stinky marsh muck"
627484,BillM,2011-10-03 23:19:00,17367," Boot foots are good when it's super cold, but you'll sweat your balls off using those in the fall.  They are absolutely NOT breathable, lol."
627499,mike rousseau,2011-10-03 23:41:00,4661,how about these?  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-First-Flightreg-Breathable-Hunting-Waders-150-Regular/749162.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dfirst%2Bflight%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts&Ntt=first+flight&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products
627532,skeeter,2011-10-04 01:20:00,1907,How about going to walmart and getting a pair of hiking boots? Works good for me.
627544,Bondar,2011-10-04 01:49:00,817,I had to go up 2 sizes with my simms
627590,Parisite,2011-10-04 04:19:00,66,I was trying on wading boots today. With some brands I needed to go a size bigger than my shoe size and other brands fit the same as my shoe size. I would recommend trying some boots on prior to ordering online.
627997,blaque,2011-10-05 13:20:00,2419," LMAO.....you'll sweat em' off hiking to that hard to get to hole, and then you'll freeze em off once you settle in the hole"
628089,craigdritchie,2011-10-05 18:18:00,1586,"That's the best advice yet, and something I've done for years. Get some inexpensive hiking boots that are two sizes larger (and perhaps a size wider) than you would normally wear. They'll only cost you about $35 and will work every bit as well as the $100+ wading boots you'll buy from a fishing store.  If Wallymart doesn't have your size, try a cheap shoe store.  I like the lug sole on hiking boots for wading, as they give a good grip on all surfaces. Some guys swear by felt soles .... they're admittedly very good on bare rock or gravel (just like a lug sole) but they're absolutely useless on mud, and that is what you find on the bottom of and along the banks of most Ontario creeks. In cold weather, felts freeze easily, so you have even less traction."
628092,mike rousseau,2011-10-05 18:27:00,4661,  Thanks... That's a great idea
628107,BillM,2011-10-05 19:37:00,17367,"If you get hiking boots from Walmart, make sure to drill in some drain holes or you'll be walking around with boots full of water all day.  Also pick up some sheet metal screws and drill them into the soles."
