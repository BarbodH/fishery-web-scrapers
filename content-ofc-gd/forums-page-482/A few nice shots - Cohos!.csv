627325,kemper,2011-10-03 18:14:00,2232,"Here's a few to look at...I've cropped them the best I can, so if you recognize the spot good for you -  fish it in the spring when it's open again.        By far the most fun fish in the river.  Kemper"
627326,Joey,2011-10-03 18:19:00,9122,"Cool, I like the last shot the best"
627376,Joeytier,2011-10-03 20:16:00,3990,"Great shots!  I've still yet to catch a coho in the tribs.  Not much of a run in my typical haunts, it seems."
627398,craigdritchie,2011-10-03 20:51:00,1586,"Love cohos. Beautiful photos, especially the last one."
627400,blaque,2011-10-03 20:55:00,2419,Same here.........Ive always dug cohos. Dont seem to ever find consistant catches of them in my area either.
627401,Musky or Specks,2011-10-03 20:58:00,2710,I don't miss steelheading to much but I certainly miss traveling up to LLSP to fish for coho's.
627474,MJL,2011-10-03 22:43:00,2427,"Sweet fish Brady. Didn't manage to get out very much this fall, but I haven't seen a coho run like the one this year in a heck of a long time. I really like the last shot"
627478,dave524,2011-10-03 23:03:00,4508,"Very nice, another fan of cohos in the tribs.  They seem to make it farther upstream in better shape than the chinook boots, that actually fight more like a boot too  Watch for period runs of coho thoughout the fall, years ago one of the biggest influx of cohos happened just b4 freeze up."
627502,canadian_copper,2011-10-03 23:48:00,925,THERE GOES MY SECRET HOLE  LOL NICE FISH BRO
627518,l2p,2011-10-04 00:32:00,346,Sweet pics and hoe buddyy
627534,BillM,2011-10-04 01:21:00,17367,YOU JUST SPOILED THE ENTIRE LAKE ONTARIO STEELHEAD FISHERY BY POSTING PICS FROM THAT SUPER DUPER SECRET SPOT!!!!!   Nice fish dude!
627543,kemper,2011-10-04 01:46:00,2232,"   Dang Bill, l2p is going to be real mad...he took me there!  Par, I have more pics that Anes took but there is some graffiti that would give it away for sure"
627566,ehg,2011-10-04 02:43:00,2666,Fine looking coho there. Grew up pretty close to there. It was great for spring steelhead in late 80's.
627880,Paulus,2011-10-05 00:08:00,522,  I love this shot. Well done!  p.-
627903,kemper,2011-10-05 01:08:00,2232," All photo credit goes to l2p on these ones! Thanks buddy  I rarely photo my own fish anymore, especially if I am fishing solo...too many cameras lost to the depths"
627944,Sawyer,2011-10-05 03:33:00,48,"To echo other members responses, the last shot is amazing.  I have yet to hook my first coho!  -Sawyer"
