627362,grimsbylander,2011-10-03 20:01:00,3016,I spoke to the seller and he said as long as the new motor doesn't push the boat over 60mph it would be fine.. I want to know if there's any truth to this.    +60mph in that boat? Hmmmm Does that sound right?
627368,ah_long,2011-10-03 20:11:00,354,"nononono.. the boat doesn't do 60MPH+, it's just that if the new motor pushes the boat over 60MPH, then it's not insurable with this company"
627372,irishfield,2011-10-03 20:14:00,26272,"Most insurance companies raise the risk $$ rate after 50mph and why mine only does 49.. being so heavy and all that 275 just can't get it past 49 !  I didn't think you'd have an insurance issue, as I've said many times there is no law against overpowering a boat in Canada and I don't imagine the insurance company can do much after the fact if they take on the insurance coverage contract with boat and HP stated on the application."
627431,spooner_jr,2011-10-03 22:02:00,193,"Typically, the insurance company will ask for the max hp rating before setting up the insurance.  If you lie, they will deny any claim."
627568,ah_long,2011-10-04 02:46:00,354,"called them up and even told them the boat saids max 90hp, but they sent it to underwriting and said it's fine"
627570,Rattletrap2,2011-10-04 02:55:00,1652,Looks like a nice boat and a good deal! Enjoy!
626634,ah_long,2011-09-30 22:23:00,354,I'm about to purchase a new boat and I found an 2003 Alumacraft Magnum 165 CS w/ a 2005 Mercury Optimax 115hp  anything I should know about this model as well as the motor?  What's a fair price for it and are there any other alternatives?  Thanks
626636,Terry,2011-09-30 22:31:00,14456,"I would think the 8,500 they are asking for is about right"
626637,ah_long,2011-09-30 22:34:00,354,obviously you know which ad i'm looking @  I feel the price is right too.. just want to know if there's any problems or issues with this year of model and the motor
626639,Terry,2011-09-30 22:39:00,14456,"any problems with the Optimax had been worked out by that year I think it a real fine motor  and I thought the whole package looked good, I had sen twit off to a friend who is looking for one, but he wants a dual console"
626640,misfish,2011-09-30 22:41:00,29133," As long as Im dry,who needs a dual?"
626641,ah_long,2011-09-30 22:41:00,354,"there's only one concern though, the boat is rated for a max of 90hp and it's a 115hp on it..  I'm not too concerned about the boat being able to handle that motor as much as whether I'll have a problem with the insurance if an issue arises (touch wood)  I spoke to the seller and he said as long as the new motor doesn't push the boat over 60mph it would be fine.. I want to know if there's any truth to this."
626642,Terry,2011-09-30 22:47:00,14456, well that can be a problem.....  you could check the us plate and see if it's good in the US for 115 hp..and get alumacraft to send you a US plate....then when you insure it you state the fact it has a us Plate and you should be OK........if the US allows the bigger motor which is usually the case
626643,misfish,2011-09-30 22:47:00,29133," There was a post regaurding over horse power.Do a search here. Not sure who started it,but did read it."
626646,ah_long,2011-09-30 23:02:00,354,seems like 90hp max is the same across the board..  I tried searching for the thread but couldn't find it.. any pointers?
626647,Billy Bob,2011-09-30 23:03:00,5865,"The first thing I thought was too much hp on a 16.5' boat.  I hate to say it but I would think insurance would be null and void if something happens....and I am not referring to the boat but rather to someone hurt, be it in the boat or elsewhere. You could be facing a HUGE lawsuit...be extra careful.  BTW is it possible that this motor could have a governor installed on it ? ? ?...  Bob"
626651,woodenboater,2011-09-30 23:12:00,2277,"not to jack your thread ah_long but a question for the wise ones here and it's kinda on topic  I'm looking at getting something similar next year or so (full console if I can swing it) and I'm not a speed demon on the water, what would be  a good all rounder for this ? 40 ? 60 ?   thx"
626652,ah_long,2011-09-30 23:12:00,354,"I highly doubt there's a governor installed on it..  I share the same concerns as you, I'm not too worried if I lose the boat as much as if someone else gets hurt"
626658,Terry,2011-09-30 23:32:00,14456,"it is only 25hp over rating...peanuts  if I remember it is the same weight as the 90 Optimax.....you could prop it it minimize the speed..but I don't think it will make that much difference  but because of insurance concerns, contact your insurance company and others and see if you can find someone to insure it..that would solve the problem   if not I will trade you for my 90hp"
626662,ah_long,2011-09-30 23:37:00,354,"as far as weight is concerned, I know it's the same as the 90 so it's ok there..  just concerned about insurance and all those legal crap.. I'm on hold with my insurance CO right now and see if I can get a green light from them  If anything, I'm thinking about buying a 90hp cover and put it on.."
626664,Alumacraft,2011-09-30 23:43:00,139,"I have the same boat but a '01 I don't have one bad thing to say about it. Great riding and handling (no feedback steering) . Mine has a nice big livewell, baitwell, lots of good laid out storage. What you might do about your motor issue is what a buddy had to do with Lund. He wanted to put larger motor on his tyee was he got them too send him a letter that their enginer / service rep. Ok'd the larger motor"
626666,ah_long,2011-09-30 23:47:00,354,"interesting, never thought about that..  I'll give that a shot...  personally I don't see a problem with the larger motor and let's face it, who doesn't want a faster boat"
626701,BFSC Kevin,2011-10-01 01:17:00,1351,That's the first thing that popped in my mind when you said 115 on a 16 footer. If you can't get a go by the insurance company then I'd skip the deal. Or just go without the insurance....
626705,mike rousseau,2011-10-01 01:25:00,4661,Just buy it and trade somebody for a smaller motor...  Shouldn't be hard to find a trade... Most guys are looking for a bigger motor...
626710,ah_long,2011-10-01 01:45:00,354,finally got a hold of him.. going to take the boat out this coming week
626760,bigcreekdad,2011-10-01 12:43:00,546,"  I have a Magnum 165 in tiller model. I bought it new about 12 years ago. Great boat....likely my last. Great ride, even in chop, lots of room, and stable as hell. Mine is powered by a 60 hp Yam 4 stroke. That's the largest the tiller model is rated for. Top end speed is about 35mph, which is fine for the water I fish (mostly French River and small inland lakes).  As others have said, I would be concerned about the motor size for that model. I like the idea from others about buying it and replacing the motor via trade or resale. The boat itself is great. Also, smaller motor will save you a little gas money."
626768,bigbuck,2011-10-01 12:57:00,2449,"Contact Alumacraft. Get a letter from one of the engineers and you will be fine. DO THAT before buying the boat. Having to mess around to trade for a smaller engine involves potential problems (blown engine or pooched lower) and also the cost to switch. Too many unkowns. That hull with a 90hp would be awesome, plenty of power to get up and go with a full load. A 115hp, even better if the boat can take it. Good luck!!!"
626957,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-02 03:15:00,4399,According to my insurance agent if you overpower a boat your insurance is null and void.
627318,ah_long,2011-10-03 17:51:00,354,I called MD marine insurance (the current insurance policy on the boat) and it's a green light  the only thing that won't be covered is if the motor falls off due to the increased weight but I don't see that as an issue  so hoping all goes well @ the test drive
627321,Terry,2011-10-03 17:54:00,14456,I knew it would work out  and I knew my buddy should have bought it...but good for you...LOL
627324,ah_long,2011-10-03 18:05:00,354,"i mostly fish solo or duo, so i think it should work good.. but if you put 3 or more ppl on the 165, I find it too cramped up"
