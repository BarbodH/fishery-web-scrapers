627759,Miracon,2011-10-04 17:35:00,200,"Wally - you said it!!! :-)  Sinclair - You are probably soooo right! But then again, I was more interested in the 2 rods peeking out from the garage loft then the closets full of shoes I could have had! Not sure how many women would have thought the same! Haha!"
627799,adolson,2011-10-04 20:49:00,783," Yeah, when I got my second rod and reel on my birthday, my wife was like ""so you can sell your other one now?"" and I was like, uh, no..."
627147,Miracon,2011-10-03 01:01:00,200,"My mother-in-law just went into a retirement home and we have been packing up her home that recently sold. A lot of stuff!  I KNOW I've been bitten by the fishing bug, because out of all the home contents of china, crystal, jewelry, etc., (that I could have) the only thing I got excited about was seeing the handles of 2 fishing rods hanging out a loft above the garage! It took 2 weeks of knowing they were up there and could be absolutely anything, to finally get them down!  They are covered in years worth of dust but I swept them off a bit and they feel sooooooo nice! I was thrilled to see they were both combos. I took pics and was hoping maybe someone here (what the hell am I thinking...maybe! Of course you guys will know!), would know if they are decent. Here are the pics...         "
627150,mike rousseau,2011-10-03 01:08:00,4661,I bet those reels are tough... They'll last a long time...  And as long as they work and you like em...  That's all that matters...  Enjoy those combos...
627151,Roy,2011-10-03 01:20:00,13728,"Yup, aside from being dirty from sitting around all that time, neither one of those reels appear to have been used very much at all. Clean them up, put new line on them and you should be fine. I still have one of those and with minimum maintenance, they'll last you a long time."
627154,mbosh1980,2011-10-03 01:33:00,349,"No joke, I rocked that bottom combo for probably 15 years. Caught everything from carp to muskie(incidental) on it. The reel gave in two summers ago and I just retired the rod as the reel seat was stripped."
627155,Miracon,2011-10-03 01:36:00,200,"Thanks Mike and Roy! The line IS worn as one broke when I hooked the hook in my sweater (long weekend and a car full of crap! haha!)! But apart from that, as you said, they look mostly unused. Just wish we'd have found them a month ago before buying the 2 Quantums! I'm sure they would have done us just fine!"
627156,Miracon,2011-10-03 01:38:00,200,OMG Bosh! Awesome to know!
627160,adolson,2011-10-03 01:42:00,783,"Yep. I can tell they're good because if you look closely, the two reels say ""Shimano.""  /fanboy"
627161,Roy,2011-10-03 01:43:00,13728," Look on the bright side. You're now a 4 combo family. When hubby breaks his two, you can rent him one of yours."
627164,Miracon,2011-10-03 01:51:00,200,"Thanks Dana! Knew they were good for bikes! haha!  Roy - LMAO! Love it and will remember that when it happens! The other bright side is we have 4 kids between us (3 of which like to fish too!), so they will come in handy! Just not sure which 2 combos we should use now if it's just the 2 of us! The Quantums or these 2. Decisions, decisions!"
627168,adolson,2011-10-03 02:00:00,783,"Take them all with you and rig each one up differently, then you can instantly change lures, or you can just have them identical if you're using live bait. Handy if you snag and break off or whatever.  I said I'd do this with my Ugly Stik, but I don't. The only thing I'll use that for now is if somehow I lose my Voltaeus in the lake... Then I'll troll over the spot with the Ugly Stik until I hook my good rod. Haha"
627174,ccmtcanada,2011-10-03 02:11:00,7971,"As long as you like them then that's all that matters!!!  Rig both rods up differently so you can switch up easily....one with classic worm and bobber maybe, and the other with a snap swivel on it so you can attach whatever lure you want.  It's all good"
627175,Miracon,2011-10-03 02:15:00,200,Dana & ccmt...this is why you guys ROCK! I wasn't even thinking outside the box enough to think that logically! Totally going to take your advice and maybe rig 2 with plastics and 2 with live and switch back and forth! Now I am totally thrilled to have 4 combos rather then whine that I could have avoided buying 2! Yeah!
627182,mercman,2011-10-03 02:49:00,7054,"Did the same thing this spring with Mom. Dad was a great angler and i found a ton of his, and my grand dads rods and tackle.One old 50's vintage levelwind, i am cleaning up this winter and will re introduce it to fishing in the spring. Who fished in your familly, to leave those combos for you to find?"
627196,adempsey,2011-10-03 05:56:00,1498,"Great little reels.  My brother has had his forever.   Not sure what type of quick fire that is (""auto reposition"" or not), but it can be a nice feature.   Harder to find reels with that nowadays."
627197,Miracon,2011-10-03 08:35:00,200,"Mercman, they were my father-in-laws. He went into a nursing home about 4 years ago with Dimentia. He wasn't a huge angler but did a little fishing. We found a little tackle box too with some stuff but nothing overly impressive in there. May post a few of the lures to see what the heck they are used for! Haha! That's awesome about the equipment you inherited!  FishLogic-That's great to know! I'll let you know about the auto reposition (whatever that is?! Haha!)."
627216,Rizzo,2011-10-03 12:02:00,4754,"I used to use those exact same combos. Once bought one for a girlfriend as part of a birthday gift (that did not go over well by the way, I was young and not very wise in the way of wimmin). They were an entry level package which I used for many years. Never had a problem with them, they're a good find because you can never have too many rods and reels! Definitely change the line though, I bet that line is just ready to jump off that spool."
627217,monsterfish,2011-10-03 12:04:00,48,I received that same reel for my 14th birthday and I still use it.  I'm 35!  Keep your hooks sharp!
627230,NAW,2011-10-03 12:32:00,4022,"Miracon,  Those are decent reels, and should last a long time.  The rods should be OK too, they may have lost a little back bone with old age.  The top rod looks like a great pan fish set up.  Make sure you clean the reels out really good before you spin them to much.  If you're in the neighbourhood, stop by, I can show you some basic reel maintenance tips.  The combos you guys bought earlier this year are mush better.  I'd be using them for my primary rod.  These two old ones are good back up rigs..  or for the kids.."
627241,Miracon,2011-10-03 13:24:00,200,"Rizzo - LMAO about the girlfriend gift! And will definitely change the line! Don't want to lose the monster I am catching next!  monster - Great to know it's lasted that long!  Nick - Awesome! I was really hoping to hear the ones we bought were better after investing the money in them. It would have been a shame to find out these are way better and we could have made do with them before buying more. I'm glad we have a little variety now though...and yes, it's perfect for the kids considering both boys love to fish too. In fact, I keep having to put off a dock fishing date with my 16 yr old son because of moving my mother-in-law.  Thanks for the offer to give some maintenance tips! I would definitely love to take you up on that and will keep in touch!"
627242,mike rousseau,2011-10-03 13:24:00,4661,Oil the reels also...
627278,adolson,2011-10-03 15:19:00,783," My Spirex has this feature, and the only way it'll make a full backwards rotation when setting the hook is if I let go of the arm. So, hold on, and you'll be fine.  I'd like it if they made a reel with constant anti-reverse as well as quick fire. I understand the logic of having the one set stop, but it'd be easy enough to just stop reeling in when the trigger lines up. But I had to choose, so I went with faster and easier casting."
627310,Miracon,2011-10-03 17:05:00,200,"Thanks Mike! Will definitely oil them!  And thanks so much Sinclair and Dana! At the moment, I seriously can't tell the difference from one combo to another so your information has been extremely helpful! I've definitely come to the right place to learn! And hopefully one day I won't be so green that I can be a little helpful to future newbies!"
627342,aplumma,2011-10-03 18:51:00,6896,"Go get um you got 4 rods to use now. You will find you are spoiled after awhile and will fish with 3 and 4 rods rigged at a time. I have usually 4 rods rigged one with top water, one with spinner bait, one with senco and the last one has a crank bait. You can then as you move from spot to spot figure out what the fish want in that area as the areas change without retying lures.  Art"
627490,Miracon,2011-10-03 23:27:00,200, Thanks so much Art! I am writing down how you mentioned how to rig them and will follow your advice!
627671,wallyboss,2011-10-04 14:05:00,1095, You can never have too many rods and reels. The 2 Shimano reels do not have instant anti-reverse?? I have a few like that and they are on my spare rods that I lend to people.  Free is always nice
