627414,Miracon,2011-10-03 21:35:00,200,Welcome Blainer! I'm quite new here myself and and am completely new to fishing. I am learning so much from the awesome group here! The Salt of the Earth hang out here. Everyone here are beyond helpful and the humour is plentiful!  A HUGE word of warning...this place is extremely addictive causing less productivity!  Consider yourself warned!!!
