627882,Handlebarz,2011-10-05 00:09:00,3790,not me I was not in a sub way that I could enter the contest
627897,Dutch,2011-10-05 00:44:00,831,"C'mon guys it's ONLY been 7 weeks since the contest ended (August 14th).  We can't possibly expect things to take any less time than that.  From what happened last year - apparently the ""legal issues"" take a long time to sort through and that is apparently the reason for the LONG wait between the end of the contest and the announcement of the winner."
