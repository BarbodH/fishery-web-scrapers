736305,walleyebob,2012-10-14 00:10:00,27,"I thought i'd report on my August fishing trip. Me and a buddy had sevn days to go go up north and do some fishing and exploring. I had bought a 14ft sportspal transom and a 2 hp honda engine which i love mainly for this trip and future ones  (The last  night i dropped the engine in the lake and thought   but the next morning after a quick oil change it started right up after a few pulls. I spent that night thinking about the possible 25 km or so paddle out   )  I wish i had pictures but our camera got wet the first day , i swear it rained everyday  At least it was warm enough things were able to most dry out between showers. In all we did fairly well with a 25"" walleye being the largest walleye that we released. It's funny we stopped to fish this small pothole lake/ pond on our way out and in 2 hours we caught 14 chuck 27-28 "" pike which were more and bigger pike than we caught in the main target lake. On our first night we camped beside this lake and heard several large splashs on the lake but never did try that night because we were so tired . It was an 8 hr drive and 2 1km plus portages up to this point in the rain .   I am definitely looking forward to next year and trying a new spot. I thinking next year we are going to try an even more remote spot and hopefully get into some true quality fishing"

736315,Rod Caster,2012-10-14 01:06:00,5784,Oil change in the middle of the bush. That has to be fun...at least the engine started up again. Hope you carried out the old oil.
736318,walleyebob,2012-10-14 01:36:00,27,"It was a great time. I had alway's wondered how much better the fishing the fishing would be on this lake because i had fished a near by lake that had easier access ( logging road pretty much right to the lake) and the fishing was ok some days. We actually stayed on this lake the last evening and could even get a nibble.  Yes i did pack out the oil , actually had planned on changining the oil before hand because honda reccommends every 20 hrs in the manual( seems not very long too me) which we were well over.   One interesting thing we did see was the last night we were trolling into a river mouth and at first it looked like a beaver swimming across (could just see a wave in the distace). As we got closer , on one side of the river a large lyxn runs into shore and into the bush and on the other bank a wolf runs in the bush on the other side. I have no idea who was chasing who neither were too small but it was quite a sight, and would never  have thought i'd see that. Never did see any moose or bear."
736319,walleyebob,2012-10-14 01:44:00,27,"Oh yes, i'd prefer to carry a motor a few km's than too have to paddle around all week plus even a 2hp is alot faster to get were your going   According to my friends gps were were 9.9 km/hr and we had one loaded canoe."

With all the rain it probably raised 6 inches because on our trip in we had to do a growling portage because on river was to low to travel up but on our way home there was more than enought water. We actual meet 3 aluminum boats on this intermediate lake that required a push over a beaver dam up this river we couldn't access on our way there coming home. Talking to them they didn't have alot of luck on that lake so we didn't even stop to fish it. They were saying they were there like 10 years ago and the pike fishing was amazing and this time they had no luck. They were actually trying to scout out getting to the lake we were at but there is no way they could get there aluminum boats how far it was  They were still 2 lakes away with 2 portages of 1-2 km each.
