My '91 Merc 115 runs like a top.  http://www.citymarinetoronto.com/  Check out all the mechanics training certificates on the wall. All current.  Tell David/Linda that Simon sent you.  ps. If you're entertaining any marine mechanics in the Burlington area, be sure to pm me. There is one company there that you definitely want to stay away from."
