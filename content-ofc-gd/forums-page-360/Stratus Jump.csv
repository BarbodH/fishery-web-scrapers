736431,misfish,2012-10-14 21:01:00,29133,"Watched til he approched 118,000,then we had to split and watch some girls hockey   . Guess we missed one piece of history.  Is there a link some where to watch the dive?"
736441,206,2012-10-14 22:08:00,563,"i swear i heard him say he was feeling like ""passing out"" on his fall?  Can't imagine his feeling when his visor was fogged and he's plummeting toward earth at such great speed not being able to see  Can't wait to see the video from his camera's  If anyone finds his footage LMK"
736443,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 22:20:00,3525," He did say that, that's why the emergency chute went up and he didn't break the record for longest free fall."
736451,Musky or Specks,2012-10-14 22:48:00,2710,Thought you all might enjoy this   That's a set of stones I tell you
736454,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 22:56:00,3525,Was anyone else wondering what that red button was on the outside?
736462,mercman,2012-10-14 23:16:00,7054,  Ejection seat
736463,Musky or Specks,2012-10-14 23:18:00,2710,He pressed it when they asked him to turn on his cameras??
736464,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 23:18:00,3525,   and how does he press it when he's inside? Seems a little pointless.
736465,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 23:19:00,3525, That might make sense but they asked him to turn on his leg cameras when he was inside for a test?
736466,The Urban Fisherman,2012-10-14 23:22:00,2050,"Watched it with Averie and Luke - Figured it was history being made and they should witness it.  I made the mistake of telling Luke that if his suit ripped his eyes could pop out... then 3 year old Luke was walking around the house going ""BLAAAHHHH MY EYES POPPED OUT - I CAN'T SEE"" over and over. lol  Anyways, it was pretty awesome to watch!  We also caught the press conference... he made Mach 1.2 so he did break the sound barrier and he pulled the shoot himself at 5200 feet... the protocol was to pull it at 5000 ft. so he'd have time to pull a backup shoot if something went wrong...  Glad we watched it!"
736467,mercman,2012-10-14 23:23:00,7054," if i remember, he hit that button when they told him to start his camera."
736468,The Urban Fisherman,2012-10-14 23:25:00,2050,"Before he jumped he said something along the lines of:  ""I know the whole world is down there watching me right now and I wish you could all see what I'm seeing right now - Sometimes you have to go really high to realize how small you are"" - I thought it was a good quote..."
736477,Christopheraaron,2012-10-15 00:14:00,3525," It was all pretty rough but sounded like it was probably pretty good, glad someone translated!"
736489,Jds63,2012-10-15 01:24:00,1365,"amazing stunt ! 0 to 690 + miles per hr in 40 seconds , I believe BBC will have a 2 hr documentary in a couple of weeks"
736503,irishfield,2012-10-15 02:47:00,26272, Fairly certain it would have been to close the door before the capsule decended.
736506,Christopheraaron,2012-10-15 02:55:00,3525, Now that makes sense!
736507,BillM,2012-10-15 03:03:00,17367, That red button started the external cameras.   They mentioned it right before he hit the button.
736565,BillM,2012-10-15 15:58:00,17367," A guy I know on a car forum works for the company that built the tubular frame for all the external cameras on the capsule..  He also told me that in order for the door to stay shut once Felix left,  they would have to re-pressurize the capsule..  That's the only reason the door sealed was from the internal pressure.. It was a pretty slick design according to him."

736390,206,2012-10-14 17:00:00,563,Just checking the board to see if anyone had linked this....This i gotta see
736392,TJQ,2012-10-14 17:12:00,7806,Crazy stuff!! Live feed here: http://www.youtube.com/user/redbull
736393,fishingwithbob,2012-10-14 17:40:00,123,Anyone calculate how big of a hole he is going to make?
736394,206,2012-10-14 17:43:00,563,"I think even if he dies the shute will open...He almost choked to death on a test jump from lower altitude  this is nuts, but technology is wonderful!"
736395,206,2012-10-14 17:46:00,563,"CNN is ahead of my ""Live"" feed?"
736397,danbouck,2012-10-14 18:04:00,4380,Video says he is at 128000' but mission control says 113000' ???
736400,Jigger,2012-10-14 18:17:00,1237,Big stones! Cant imagine the thoughts as he stepped out and then off. That is one crazy guy!!!
736401,Rich Clemens,2012-10-14 18:18:00,3131,That was awesome
736402,grt1,2012-10-14 18:20:00,638,he's got bigger ones than me
736403,lew,2012-10-14 18:20:00,12766,Give the guy an A+ for guts !!
736405,TJQ,2012-10-14 18:24:00,7806,That was just incredible.
736406,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 18:25:00,3525,Just finished watching for 2 hrs! Awesome! Guy's got guts!
736408,Handlebarz,2012-10-14 18:32:00,3790,That was crazy awesome.
736409,Roy,2012-10-14 18:38:00,13728,Watched the whole thing. History being made. Now tell me that you had dry eyes as you witnessed his safe landing and watched his family and friends as they watched him land. Just great. Thanks for putting me onto it Dave.
736410,woodenboater,2012-10-14 18:47:00,2277,"Man, dropping into a half pipe was crazy enough for me back in the day. But to step off into nothing from 120XXX feet is totally off the charts. Hopefully this can lead to technology that can help astronauts who encounter severely adverse situations.  It was great to watch his mom's reaction and her immense relief when he came out of the spin and deployed the chute."
736411,Muskieman,2012-10-14 18:48:00,2472,"First ever televised suicide attempt , glad he didn't succeed , that was pretty cool ... Excellent protocol and safety measures , a whole lot better than the Wellenda/Niagara crossing .... Contrats to Felix Baumgartner !"
736413,mercman,2012-10-14 19:01:00,7054,"Most amazing thing i have seen since man allegedly set foot on the moon. Awesome courage, and emotional landing"
736423,Handlebarz,2012-10-14 20:11:00,3790,I watched it on my iPhone with my son it was cool sitting on the couch sharing the time. Best part was when Mikey said what would happen if he lands on a cactus all I could do was laugh more then a lol. I was very worried when he was spinning then silence and the shot of mission control it did not seem good for that short period.
736424,davey buoy,2012-10-14 20:20:00,5505,That could sure open a can of worms Paul !!!!!.
736425,ch312,2012-10-14 20:31:00,1590," i think they meant the cabins pressure was equivalent to X number of feet while he was at 128k and equalizing the pressure. of course, i could be totally wrong"
736427,Rich Clemens,2012-10-14 20:43:00,3131, I think you got it.
736429,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 20:47:00,3525, He did.
736430,mercman,2012-10-14 20:54:00,7054,  I was bored.
