735932,Ron,2012-10-11 20:05:00,1683,"Hey all,  Just curious if anyone has dealt with this Canadian based website for ordering parts for a Maytag dryer. If you have ordered parts on line with another company, who were they and what was the service like?  Thanks for any input.  Cheers, Ron..."
735935,fishnsled,2012-10-11 20:24:00,3520,Send Mercman a PM with what you need Ron. He's helped me and a few others that I know of on the board. Service and price were great.
735936,irishfield,2012-10-11 20:24:00,26272,Send Mercman a PM Ron... from what I've heard nobody can beat his prices or service.
735937,fishnsled,2012-10-11 20:28:00,3520,Were you looking over my shoulder Wayne? lol!
735938,Ron,2012-10-11 20:28:00,1683,"Hey, I think I will send Mercman a PM, from what I have been told, you can't beat his service or prices.  Thanks guys!  Cheers, Ron..."
735939,bare foot wader,2012-10-11 20:30:00,1354,"sounds like mercman can help you out....but if not, I have used partselect before and no problems...ordered some stove parts, at my door a little less than 2 weeks later (probably 7 or 8 business days, it was over the wknd), I was happy...didn't research how competitive their prices were, my total bill was 70ish so i was ok placing the order right away"
735991,ketchenany,2012-10-11 23:47:00,3229,"  Yes merc is the man, even sent me FREE screwdrivers with my order!"
736012,mercman,2012-10-12 01:30:00,7054,"  So, what are we looking for Ron? Parts Select are ok, but they play a little dirty.Not useing proper manufacturers part numbers, so you cant check priceing or find the part anywhere else but them. Feel free tp drop me a PM anytime at all. I can even do the research right here and right now LOL."
736013,GBW,2012-10-12 01:36:00,8460,I have to say that Paul's service was VERY fast and I knew I didn't need to shop around.  so another vote for mercman.
736014,GBW,2012-10-12 01:37:00,8460,you can't figure it out from right at the start?
736018,mercman,2012-10-12 01:41:00,7054,I dont sell dryers Geoff.......but i could order the parts so he can build one
736020,mercman,2012-10-12 01:42:00,7054, Much obliged
736028,Rattletrap2,2012-10-12 03:16:00,1652,"As it turned out, I didn't actually need parts for my Daughters Range, but Paul was a tremendous help to me with great info!"
