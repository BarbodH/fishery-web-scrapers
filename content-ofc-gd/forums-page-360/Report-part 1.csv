As everyone experienced it was an intensely hot summer! Personally not my cup of tea but the fish didn’t seem to mind all that much! My summer began with only two quick trips out o the St. Marys to chase Atlantics before I had to head north.           July took me up to the big town of Oba, Ontario for a two week guide job at Ontario North Fishing Adventures. Having been twice before, I knew exactly what kind of fishing to expect..... Even though I didn’t bring a camera I was able to snap a few photos with my ipod.  Guest cabin   Oba River....which we ran 12km up each day                   Biggest pike was 35"", walleye 25"" and a few jumbos were caught including a gigantic 15 3/4 incher!  I decided to do some bass fishing on my next few trips from both a kayak and boat. I had a blast flipping and pitching for largies in the thick stuff. This is one style of fishing I don’t do enough but will be in the future...I hope!  Didn’t do a lot of smallmouth fishing but some were caught off docks.               Next up I had Rich who heads the Border City Classic up for a day of fishing in Lake Superior Park. Rich hasn’t fished for lake or brook trout much so I gave him a quick run  down on my set-up and we were off in our Hobies.  Despite a rather slow first hour I took him on my milk run and we must of landed 15 lakers between the two of us and Rich also hit two nice brookies.           Next up was a day in LSPP but with no fishing rods! We just hit the beach, chilled then had a bite to eat at the Voyageur on the way home.         Since we enjoyed relaxing at the beach so much we decided that a camping trip was needed. A group of us headed up into the park the following weekend. We stayed at a campsite that was about a 20-25 minute hike but it was well worth it.......  The next two days and nights were filled of drinking, eating, swimming and drinking.....lol                       not enough room for one post....part 2 is posted   TDunn"

736118,EC1,2012-10-12 20:59:00,930,"The walleye look very tasty! BTW, I think largemouth fishing in the thick stuff is probably the most fun type of fishing there is!"
