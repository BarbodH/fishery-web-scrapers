735418,Roy,2012-10-09 16:26:00,13728,"Another exceptional report, Kevin. You did great. Now we all have hawg envy."
735469,Whitespinnerbait,2012-10-09 21:58:00,2038,"  Very easy to access the lake in question, But it's a Lake trout lake ( a good size one at that ) with maybe a dozen or so cottages...........and none of them seem interested in fishing"
735476,Fishing 24/7,2012-10-09 22:38:00,709,  when you talk to the locals about fishing bass they think your stupid for even trying for them!   :whistling:
735479,kemper,2012-10-09 23:08:00,2232," Length is surprising - my old man pulled a 23.5"" smallie from Buckhorn a few years back and it didn't even break 6lbs. Was a bit of a snake, and its best days were probably behind it... might have been record material at one point in her life."
735480,Fishing 24/7,2012-10-09 23:18:00,709,"  it depends on how the fish are built man.  i cought some fish that were built like a tank like the ones in this report dude 18-20 ''  a 19 '' is a nickel a 20 '' is a 6 lbs bass.  then i fished another lake  bass are built like WUSS.  HUGE HEAD you can fit two knuckles in them.  but the body bro no girth. snake type of a fish.  a 20 is a nickel a 22 '' is a 6 pound bass.  like a musky its all in the girth.  the lengh has nothing to do with what th efish will weigh.  ITS ALL IN THE GUT!  look at a 5,6 male with a beer gut chances are hes 300 lbs  im 5,6 and i weigh 135 lbs  think about it."
735510,Lungelarry,2012-10-10 01:24:00,294,"5'6""....135lbs, your just a goby in the fish world...........congrats"

736172,LefroyFisherman,2012-10-13 01:17:00,602,Huge Bass! amazing!
736536,RangerGuy,2012-10-15 12:43:00,564,"Those are some huge bass!!! if I didn't see the colour of the leaves, I would have thought you were down south somewhere.. Truely trophy largies & smallies!  Thanks for sharing"
735288,Fishing 24/7,2012-10-09 00:03:00,709,"The title says it .  I SAW ... What Must be the new Quebec/Canada Large Mouth Bass Record.  Some will believe and others will dream.  some say its impossible.  the canadian record was set in what 1789 ?  What i SAW and what i Landed ...... There a fine line .  Me and a buddy went out for a October camp on a remote island.  the only info i can give you is thats its FAR FAR north.  some would say the bass need hot water to grow big.  There doing fine in this laker infested cold waters.    All week was on overcast day.  rain on and off. wind 10 - 40 km/h sometimes.  high of 15 oc low of -2 .  i even saw the first snow this year and the first frost....  my hands are still sore from the cold and from all the fish and all the hook sets and the repetetive casting.  How many cat's can one throw in 4 days... we will never know.    Some were on the flip others on the spinner bait.  heck i could have done the hole trip with just 2 lures..  why bother with 10 000 $ of equipement ?    iv had 10-12 different buddies in my boat this year and everytime i see there 15 $ rod and reel combo i threw it in the lake makes for a gift to the gods.  a give them a heavy casting rod with a good 7 to 1 wich reel on it.  trust me on this one 20 lbs fluoro straight no leaders. 1/4 spool .      This 20 '' x 16 '' hit a Huge black and blue beaver on a 3/4 titleshot jig.      my buddies and i were trying to catch the perfect release shot even tho the water temp was 58oF .  we finaly got a picture that reveals the true size of a 6 lbs bass swimming away.  After throwing mikes set up to the fish and creating new structure.  he got hes flipping skillz tested.    wasent hard when im putting him right in the honey holes but the smile on his face... i didnt tell him.  YEAH BRO YOU GETTING GOOD A THIS !  Frank laurin ( big hit lures) had a big part in this outting.  slow rolling the double colorado blades perch patern 1/2 onze was a must.    The rain was on and off like a light switch.    this pic reminds me of your chromers / stealhead / brown trout outting. minus the trout..... just the pants .  when the sun came out . i knew the rocks were getting hot. the deep rocks/ rock faces.  i flip a HOT rock . a Large Mouth Bass was sun tanning and saw a Crayfish land on his face.  GULP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    19.5 '' Pure muscles.        As the sun was setting the cold temp were kicking in.  bon fires and rhum was key.  i slept next to the fire in my - 40 sleeping bad looking up at the stars. it was spectacular.  The next day would be one of the best days of my bass fishing season.  Im slow rolling the spinner bait over a drop off. minding my own buisness.  And this TANK from WW2 comes up and DESTROYS the lure to bits and pieces.  literaly Ripping my rod, reel ,hand , arm and body into the water.  This bass was on a mission and the bait fish was not suposed to survive this hit.  After the boat flip back into its up right position.    This 18 '' bass lost the fight.  Mike realy liked the new set up i had put in his hands.    Landing smallies was hes new goal in life.  We did our part for the bait fish.  eating a couple of bass after all the hard winching we had done throughout the day.      after a bass fiesta it was our last outting of the trip an outting i wont soon forget.  i flip the same shoal.  *TOC*  Set the hook like a mad man.  Mike you better get the net for this one.    Believe it or not another 20 '' Pig made its way into the boat.  Just a couple of houres left into the long week-end.  and im slow rolling the spinner bait again.... back to my old habits i guess.  The my OTHER ARM gets Ripped into the lake. thewse bass had a meeting or something.... Rip this GUYS are off Befor he punches Holes all over our faces!        All the Huge spawners were released .  we kept 6 bass out of the Crazy numbers we got.  my hand is sore just typing this report.  and im still trying to warm up beeing chilled to the BONE.  But it was well worth the effort.     Enjoi!"
