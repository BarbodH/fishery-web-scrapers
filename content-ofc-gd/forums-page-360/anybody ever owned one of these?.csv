It's small enough that I think I could tow it with my moms mazda 3, keep it in the garage, and it goes reallly fast..     EDIT: here's another clip:"
736327,ah_long,2012-10-14 02:40:00,354,if you think that's fast  
736328,northernpike56,2012-10-14 02:52:00,717,    lol
736329,irishfield,2012-10-14 02:58:00,26272,Had one as a kid that my brother built. Keep in mine.. when you stop suddenly.. they transom swamp and sink!
736337,dave524,2012-10-14 08:28:00,4508,"Teenage buddy had one similar in the early sixties, pretty sure the plans came from the old Mechanics Illustrated mag. That looks like a step up from what he had, like Irish says we were fine with a 10 horse on the back but one day we clamped on a 18, and that was wild , had to beach it to stop or you would sink  OHH!! the one he had was called a Sea Flea, lots of info if you google it. He and his dad built it in the garage, rounded bottom from memory not a tunnel."
736342,GBW,2012-10-14 12:17:00,8460,"Been there and done that...  I too had a 'sea-flea' and it went like a bat outa hell with even an 8HP on it.  My top speed was 22mph in it and I was 5'10 (or so) and about 175lb's.  Mine was a flat bottom and the only 'pontoons' on it were at the front on both sides.  also look up ""pickel fork"" boat design as two of my uncles build and raced these.  in fact 1 of them in the Mansfield area might still have one."
736343,GBW,2012-10-14 12:19:00,8460,"one last thing, if the motor cannot get you up on plane quick then it's time for an upgrade as you can swamp yourself or even flip it due to the back end dropping.  you want to get almost on the bow asap to get it on plane."
736344,GBW,2012-10-14 12:23:00,8460,This is the kind I had; never had a helmet tho when I was a kid...  
736364,NAW,2012-10-14 14:22:00,4022,"my dad built one as a kid.  It's on the bottom of 6-mile lake somewhere.  The neighbour at the cottage has one as well.  runs a tricked out OMC 15 hp.  The motor is heavily modified, but the guy boasts that it will run 50 - 60 mph..."
736368,fishermccann,2012-10-14 15:10:00,655,"A good friend of mine had one in the 70's with a 15 on it. He hit a stump with it , he was ejected but the boat went  airborn, 5 feet up into a tree on shore ,with the moter still running, It never went back in the water again."
736372,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 15:42:00,3525,Reading the replies it sounds like you may be better off getting a jon with a 15 for fishing.
736373,BillM,2012-10-14 15:43:00,17367,Sounds like a death wish to me..  Goodluck!  lol
736376,northernpike56,2012-10-14 15:50:00,717,    the one I found has a 20 hp johnson on it
736377,northernpike56,2012-10-14 15:51:00,717,    How did they even end up 'catching' the boat?

736385,BillM,2012-10-14 16:15:00,17367,Who would ever wanna fish out of that thing?
736387,Terry,2012-10-14 16:22:00,14456,fun ride had to have guys hold the back up till we took off or it would sink and had to run it up on shore to quit......
736396,fishermccann,2012-10-14 17:53:00,655,"I fish from a seadoo lots of times, it is great for scouting shallow areas."
736404,GBW,2012-10-14 18:21:00,8460,"ahh, the good old ""regatta"" days..."
