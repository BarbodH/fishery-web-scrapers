Kid had a blast playing with a few 2-3 lb fish in the river today, and had a great time walking/working the dog last week(mom was there for that,just for safety). Looks like I'm on the way to creating a future outdoorsmen. Hope everyone else is enjoying the Autumn . PS, Brian (Misfish) the kid left you a few Cheers R      "
