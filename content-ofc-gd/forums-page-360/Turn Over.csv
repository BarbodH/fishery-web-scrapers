735973,Twocoda,2012-10-11 22:42:00,4130,you lose the thermocline as the surface temperature water get dispersed though out the depths...then fish will be scattered all through the water column...happens after a big blow for a few days..  Just noticed....edit to add...welcome to the board

735979,mike rousseau,2012-10-11 22:51:00,4661,"Hmm  From what I've read it's when surface temps get colder then bottom temps causing the water on the bottom to rise to the surface and surface water to sink to the bottom....  So the lake literally ""turns over"""
