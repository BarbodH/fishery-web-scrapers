736460,Christopheraaron,2012-10-14 23:13:00,3525,LOL! Can you show us what a juiced skeeter looks like next?

736518,Billy Bob,2012-10-15 09:35:00,5865,"You see........if that was a original Toyota battery, the press would of broke..................."
736522,buick14,2012-10-15 10:46:00,741,"You know I have that exact energizer I bought from Wally mart, in 2008, and it still works like a charm (outlasted my deka's!).  Anybody know of a place which will give me cash for about 5 crapped out boat batteries?....I know u get core on trade in, but I just need to rid of the batteries.    Anyways, it hurts to see that in the press, I assume it let you down when you needed it most!"

736534,Parisite,2012-10-15 12:38:00,66,Everyone on the board should take up a collection of gobies and send them to whitespinnerbait. Squish them a dozen at a time in clear plastic containers.
