736192,mercman,2012-10-13 03:15:00,7054,I have seen this same thing on a couple of fish i caught too.VHS or Aliens???  
736201,Dave Bailey,2012-10-13 11:07:00,1641,"I did this image search for ""fish vhs"" and it certainly looks like it."
736203,Luke V.,2012-10-13 11:34:00,286,I would say 40-50% of the fish I have caught this year on the lower have looked like this. Some much worse than others.  It seemed to be more common with fish coming from the shallow weed beds
736213,outllaw,2012-10-13 12:57:00,1232,the only actual way is to test the fish.
736215,Dave Bailey,2012-10-13 13:01:00,1641," Looks unappetizing, but from what I've heard they are perfectly safe for human consumption. In fact if I caught one I would probably cook it up, it removes one more infected fish from the system. A drop in the bucket maybe, but it couldn't hurt."

736256,GBW,2012-10-13 18:44:00,8460,Welcome and good 1st post too.
736276,livinisfishin,2012-10-13 21:01:00,661,Thats some painful looking stuff
736278,northernpike56,2012-10-13 21:32:00,717,"thats pretty gross.. especially the one with the infection on his/her underside. I caught one in the upper reaches of a small stream I fish, and he had the same thing behind his gill. I kept him (don't like the bass messing with my resident trout), and just didn't fillet the infected part off. It seemed fine to me, I do the same with the lamprey marks on steelhead, and I'm still here!  Matt."
