735512,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-10 01:30:00,196,A quick compresson test could have showed you that your machine was suffering from a cracked piston. You can order a new high compression piston online that'll guarantee that your machine will blow the weeds out of any whippper snipper on the market......
