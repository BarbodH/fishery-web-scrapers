735463,Rod Caster,2012-10-09 21:34:00,5784,"Casting randomly into polluted and un-natural waters with anything that resembles something alive and reeling it in while I read OFC on my phone. Actually, for smallies, I've become a real fan of 4"" white tube with a straight-eye 1/4oz, long shank jig. Has worked really well near rock piles."
735465,Stoty,2012-10-09 21:36:00,2910, AMEN! Just make sure you dont bold the product names...
735467,manitoubass2,2012-10-09 21:49:00,11391,"Spinnerbaits, then top waters, then flat raps or xraps.  Almost everything after that is plastics, weighted or unweighted, depending on depth. Favorite plastic is still the Black & red flake Berkley chigger craw  Pretty quick it will be drop shotting ^^^ X-zone Slammers"
