736478,Rich Nelson,2012-10-15 00:15:00,332,Awesome fish Moe. Catch n release at its best!
736479,Handlebarz,2012-10-15 00:16:00,3790,Very nice great way to end the season again.
736480,Gregoire,2012-10-15 00:17:00,1397,That is cool. With the population being as small as it is in Georgian Bay I would guess that it is the same fish.
736481,lew,2012-10-15 00:18:00,12766,"Beautiful fish, congrats on that one.  And every chance it's the same fish as the year before, I once caught the same fish 3 times over a year and another time I caught one twice in a weekend."
736483,moemoe,2012-10-15 00:25:00,352,"I had fished the spot quite a few times over the summer with nothing but pike, thought it was cool the fish returned to literally the exact spot a year latter"
736491,Joey,2012-10-15 01:44:00,9122,"Beautiful fish, very cool if it is the same one.  Sure looks like it"
736496,glen,2012-10-15 01:56:00,2641,Nice work. I hope you get her again next year.
736546,spinnerbaitking,2012-10-15 14:07:00,1622,Very Nice but I hope I catch it next year lol Tight Lines SBK

736558,mistaredone,2012-10-15 15:11:00,913,Solid fish man congrats!
736559,ehg,2012-10-15 15:15:00,2666,Very nice musky!  You can tell it is the same one just by looking at the plating and its face.  This has happened to me as well. Did a post on a few different versions of board going back many yrs. ago. Here is that post. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=223    No doubt to me you caught the same fish twice. Beauty fish and surroundings. Congrats!
736596,irishfield,2012-10-15 19:30:00,26272, Tagged Muskie on GBay... interesting!  Great fish Moemoe !!!
736597,Terry,2012-10-15 19:36:00,14456,"well they are not tagged with radio transmitters I monitor all tagged radio telemetry frequencies, to find muskie and can't find any on Gbay  lol"
736611,mike rousseau,2012-10-15 19:57:00,4661,LOOKS LIKE THE SAME FISH...  THE DARK SPOT ON ITS BACK LOOKS THE THE ONLY SCUFF THAT HASNT CHANGED....  MY BROTHER DID A RECAPTURE A FEW YEARS BACK... 55 INCHER TWICE IN THE SAME SEASON... 2 MONTHS APART... ON THE SAME SPOT... ONCE EARLY SEASON (LATE JUNE- LATE LULY) THEN AGAIN IN EARLY FALL (SEPT-OCT)...  HAD A PATTERN OF LAMPREY MARKS ON ITS HEAD THAT WERE UNMISTAKABLE....
736631,kickingfrog,2012-10-15 20:41:00,8333,"The Musky Hunter magazine had an article recently that mentioned the same muskie caught 7 years apart.  November 1, 2004 the fish was 50 inches and on Sept 11, 2011 the fish was 54.5 inches. The fish was caught in Minnesota's Lake Vermilion."
736643,Christopheraaron,2012-10-15 21:21:00,3525, COOL!
