Thanks!"
735902,torco,2012-10-11 18:29:00,656,The first step in selecting a fly reel is figuring out what you are using it for. In fly fishing the reel is not nearly as important as the rod and line.  If it is for small trout and bass for example its merely a line holder and need not be expensive.  If you are going after larger game fish like steelhead then the reel should ideally be large arbour to help reel in line faster and have a good drag system to help fight the fish.  That reel in your picture is from Patagonia and is likely expensive

735911,Bondar,2012-10-11 18:59:00,817,"he said he couldnt find any info on it , i just posted some info on it that is all  look at Maybe an Okuma SLV cheap and pretty bullet proof , that was my first fly reel   if you go on ebay and type in the weight of fly reel you would like you'll have about 5000 choices from $6 - $6000"
735926,bare foot wader,2012-10-11 19:41:00,1354,"what do you plan to fish for?  if trout and bass just get a cheap and simple click pawl drag and spend the savings on quality fly line  if you plan to go after salmon, steelhead, pike then spend a bit more and get a disc drag  virtually all manufacturers make entry level reels...okuma makes a decent reel for the money"
