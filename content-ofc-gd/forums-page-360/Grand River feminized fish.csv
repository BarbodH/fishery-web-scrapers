735216,rmarentette,2012-10-08 15:56:00,124,"Before everyone starts jumping on the bottled water bandwagon read this article from the BC Medical Journal- http://www.bcmj.org/council-health-promotion/bottled-vs-tap-water  It states in the article that bottled water falls under the Food and Drug Act and under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. How many of you are eating Alberta beef this week? The bottlers charge an exorbitant price, with very little paid for gaining access to a most precious resource. As for mistrusting municipal water systems after the Walkerton tragedy remember that it was caused by unqualified personnel. It's going to get worse as private interests try to gain control of locally run water treatment facilities. Water is the new oil, let's not let this happen!"
735811,Jacob,2012-10-11 12:08:00,186, Finally!  Someone who reads and gets the bottled water problem.
735896,G.mech,2012-10-11 18:08:00,830,"So, just to sum things up:   1) Women are to blame for the mutant fish and should give up the pill  2) Fish with both sex organs like to party  3) The last point is not 100% clear... It's either that mutant fish are the bottled water manufacturer's fault or the fish should not have used bottled water, I'm not sure.  In either case, we need to blame the world's problems on water bottlers, they are evil.  Soda pop manufacturs apparently use no water, plastic or energy and provide a healthy product for our kids....    I'll take what's behind door #2 cause it makes me laugh.  How folks can turn a serious concern over pharmaceutical chemicals in our ground water into an arguement over the safety and morality of putting water in a bottle totally escapes me.   They are mutually exclusive arguements and the latter one has nothing to do with the original post."
735913,SirCranksalot,2012-10-11 19:05:00,3291," So, what's your point?"
736027,G.mech,2012-10-12 02:51:00,830,"  Point is, start another thread, preferrably on another forum, to debate bottled water.  Although it is great cannon fodder for so called environmentalists, it has nothing to do with this particular discussion."
734889,rmarentette,2012-10-06 19:54:00,124,"CTV has a news story about male fish in the Grand River filled with eggs. This is happening in other North American locations. Several years ago, a study of Walpole Island birth statistics showed an alarming decline in male birth rates due to suspected environmental exposure. Just the other day a comment was made on this board that stated that the environmentalists have gone too far. It's incidents like this that should be raising a red flag, but unfortunately too many people are still in denial! At the risk of being subjected to ridicule or being labeled as an alarmist, here is the link.  http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/video?playlistId=1.985637"
734900,captpierre,2012-10-06 20:42:00,2521,Blame in part the birth control hormones in the sewage systems.  Good thing I still have a deep voice
734933,ttahhan,2012-10-06 23:45:00,191,Thank you for sharing....when i saw this post.....i thought it was a joke...but after reading and watching it ....its alarming Im trying to imagine the impact to the fisheries sector....but not sure if it would really be bad ...........its just so left field....
734959,danc,2012-10-07 01:53:00,4677,Something like this is bound to happen when we are putting (stocking) fish all over the country. Why are we catching Pacific Salmon in Ontario and Ontario Brook Trout in BC? Because we can? Stuff like this is just wrong.
734966,Joeytier,2012-10-07 02:06:00,3990,I'd like to know why you think that's AT ALL relevant to this topic.
734978,blarg,2012-10-07 02:36:00,289,"  You should raise your concern with environmentalists many of whom are modern progressive women on the pill, ask if they are willing to give it up to save the fish, take note of the blank stare you receive in return."
734982,Gregoire,2012-10-07 02:51:00,1397," Although this opinion is twisted in the implied assumption that if we were more conservative as a society we would be better off, it does raise a valid point. How many environmentalists would be willing to give up their car?  For the record the amount of hormones flushed down the toilet is minuscule compared to the chemical hormones released by the industrial sector into our water. I also think that the public is kept in the dark in terms of how much the products they use damage the world we live in. But that is just my opinion as a somewhat left leaning environmentalist, who by my own admission am not willing to give up my car.  I hope you were trying to be ironic by blaming modern progressive women for this problem. I hope you weren't the type of person who watched the meaning of life and had a tear come to your eye during the ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" bit."
734992,danc,2012-10-07 03:37:00,4677," Even if I'm wrong, and I probably am, it's a man made problem that will never be solved. My opinion is that we are screwing up this planet by the minute and it is irreversible. I'd like to know what your answer is to such problems Joeytier. Relevance solves nothing here."
734994,Nipfisher,2012-10-07 03:47:00,2449,"My new career has me working in water and waste-water. I just came back from Barrie where I took a week long water course put on by Walkerton Clean Water Centre. According to the instructor the Grand River is an absolute horror story. There are lots (I think 7) waste-water treatment plants on the river and although they follow strict Ministry of Environment standards there is still minute ammounts of harmfull chemicals in the effluent that accumulate in the water. Add to that industrial site dumpage/spills, septic tank leechate, city water run-off, and agricultural waste and the river is full of contaminants.  Pretty scarry that several communities draw ther water from the Grand."
735004,northernpike56,2012-10-07 04:43:00,717,"So, we shouldn't go eating any 20 inch bass or 30 inch pike from the grand then??????"
735014,captpierre,2012-10-07 12:11:00,2521,Wow.  Not too surprised.  Then add in low waterflow mid summer and winter when  less crap is flushed out to Erie  I'd be drinking bottled water
735022,outllaw,2012-10-07 13:21:00,1232,"if you think the grandr. bad. try the thames. we are 1 flush downriver from london.efluents from farming,manufacturing far exceed crap from toilets. oops unless it rains."
735023,timmeh,2012-10-07 13:31:00,609,And to think the Grand is very clean now compared to what is was a few decades ago. There are some many emerging chemicals of concern and no one really knows their impact on the environment or people. Very interest episode on nature proposing that chemicals in our environment are partly to blame for societies obesity problem. And unlike diet and exercise it's not something we can change.  This is one reason why I don't consume fish from southern Ontario.
735025,Rich,2012-10-07 13:36:00,3927,This should more be a signal of what the water contamination is doing to US.
735036,Fish Farmer,2012-10-07 15:05:00,2234,This has been happening in Hamilton harbor for some time now with the estrogen and ammonia coming from the treated sewage water and ending up in the harbor fish. RGB has netted Pike with both male and female organs.
735037,Rich,2012-10-07 15:08:00,3927,I hear those types like to party.
735038,GbayGiant,2012-10-07 15:26:00,1780,What about quear deer? A Doe with a set of horns? What is with that? It is a good thing they are mostly found down in the southern parts of Onatrio because I sure hope they don't start showing up here.  
735041,Christopheraaron,2012-10-07 16:10:00,3525,"I'm fishing the grand today, guess I won't be eating any of the catch!"
735065,northernpike56,2012-10-07 19:40:00,717,"yep, the thames is way more gross then the grand. The grand in the upper reaches is actually pretty clean, at least I think. Past brantford it's pretty gross."
735077,bushart,2012-10-07 20:54:00,2628,I you'sd ta eat phish outta dat River in the 60's when I wuz a kidd---and I'ze kan wreed n rite  think I you'sd ta chear for da Leafs den two----figurr any konnections
735081,SirCranksalot,2012-10-07 21:38:00,3291,"Something fishy is going on here!!---------------oooops, couldn't resist!"
735082,SirCranksalot,2012-10-07 21:40:00,3291," Naah, Leaf fans have far more serious problems than that!   "
735092,Nipfisher,2012-10-07 23:22:00,2449,  Water that has been treated and distributed to your home is safer then any bottled water!
735137,Rich,2012-10-08 03:28:00,3927," But... like... you could, either way... right"
735211,captpierre,2012-10-08 15:25:00,2521,"As far as  drinkingwater plant treatment goes.  They remove sediment and kill organisms.  Usually with chlorine.  Chemicals, heavy metals, hormones  -are mostly untouched.  I know in some provinces ( I think Alberta) municipal sewage waste has to be dumped into the river upstream from the drinking water intake.  Makes you do a good job treating the waste.  Still, lots of things get thru.  Increased waterflow spring/fall dilutes it all more.  But midsummer/winter......."
