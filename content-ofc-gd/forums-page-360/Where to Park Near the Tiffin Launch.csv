I'm probably going to be fishing in and around Barrie for perch and smallies in the next couple of weeks, but then I had a question I wanted to ask before I get a ticket for parking at the Tiffin Launch.  Is there somewhere I can park and walk back to the launch, or will I need to find somewhere else to go? Thanks and have a good weekend!"
736125,BillM,2012-10-12 21:25:00,17367,Lots and lots of parking down there..  No need to park at the launch if you don't have a boat.  I would suggest parking across the street in the big gravel lot.
736138,Fisherman,2012-10-12 22:40:00,7201,"Or go to the parking lot directly west of the launch and walk back across the foot bridge, takes about 45 seconds."
736292,EC1,2012-10-13 22:47:00,930,Thanks Gentlemen! Used the parking lot where you have to walk across the footbridge. Boy oh Boy does that spot right past the foot bridge smell awful   ....Lol.
736354,Fisherman,2012-10-14 12:53:00,7201,"Ya, right across the road is the turd burgler factory, can get a little rancid now and then."
