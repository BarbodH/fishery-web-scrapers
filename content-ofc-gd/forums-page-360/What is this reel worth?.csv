735184,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-08 13:41:00,196,"I have a Daiwa Fuego 2000 spinning reel in good condition.   It's one of the older red coloured ones with the magnesium bodies.   The reel still works great although not as smooth as it was brand new.  Maybe it just needs a good cleaning and to be lubed (??). The reel is in great condition cosmetically (9/10) with just a bit of the finish worn away by the bail support. I have the extra aluminum spool, all papers and box with the reel.  I'm thinking about selling this reel and was wondering what a fair price would be.        "

735223,Dutch,2012-10-08 16:17:00,831,Older reel with some rash - $75 for a quick sale $100 if you want to wait a bit.  Get it working 100% first.

735878,ah_long,2012-10-11 16:47:00,354,"keep it, it's not worth selling considering how Tackle Warehouse just blew out the new Fuegos for cheap and just botched the market...  if you really insist on selling it, you're looking @ around $75"
