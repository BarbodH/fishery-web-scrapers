I had planned on Pefferlaw perch due to the busy action, but the wind forecast looks ugly for my tin boat.  Any recommendations on where we can connect with some fish from shore?  I've heard of the Barrie docks, the beaver(?) river and a public dock on the west side of Cooks (near/south of Lefroy, I think).  What are your thoughts on our chances of success in those locales at this time of year?  Your input is much appreciated.  Also, can GTA minnows be used in simcoe or do I buy them up there?  I haven't used bait in a while.  Many thanks in advance!  MoB"

735795,misfish,2012-10-11 10:10:00,29133, They chain lock the gates at the docks now. No fishing from them.The breakwall at Heritage Park is your best bet.

735877,SirWhite,2012-10-11 16:35:00,210,Lefroy dock will hold panfish for sure. Use worms instead of minnows. I believe there is a bait shop on site. Good luck.
