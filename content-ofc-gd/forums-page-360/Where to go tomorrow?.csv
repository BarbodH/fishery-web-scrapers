735719,Christopheraaron,2012-10-10 21:57:00,3525,"Thinking of going out tomorrow morning with the canoe. Thinking of hitting mitchell or canal for some pike, bass and maybe some shore musky. I just want to get into a setting like the kawarthas for a while and try for some pike before it gets too cold. What do you guys think? (would have to be within an hours drive) Thanks!"
735726,mistaredone,2012-10-10 22:41:00,913,Might be too windy to be in a canoe tomorrow. 8-22kts according to windfinder in orillia
735728,davey buoy,2012-10-10 22:50:00,5505,"What about the Holland river/canal in Bradford?,sheltered,not much musky thou."
735731,woodenboater,2012-10-10 22:53:00,2277,"PD day or skipping class  agree with davey, sheltered river might be best option, unless it lines up with the blow"
735732,Christopheraaron,2012-10-10 22:57:00,3525, Home schooled remember?  The holland's a little ugly this time of year what about going a little further to big chute? Would it be sheltered enough?
735733,woodenboater,2012-10-10 22:59:00,2277,you're home schooled ? cool. toronto islands maybe ?

735735,Christopheraaron,2012-10-10 23:12:00,3525,  Big chute or holland? Either way I'd love to! Maybe I'll just opt for some shore exploration tomorrow.
735736,davey buoy,2012-10-10 23:15:00,5505, Holland.
