735785,musky_hunter,2012-10-11 03:40:00,328,"looking at a proper bib and jacket. Would like to buy locally as i want to try on the bib and jacket first. I dont want to spend $500 and have bib too long or sleeves too short!! what rain gear do you guys recommend? BPS 100 MPH, Frabill FXE, or the new Shimano Dryfenders?"
735817,DaveMc,2012-10-11 12:23:00,89,"Well, i bought a Frogg Toggs set mid year this year and i have the Shimano Dryfender set coming in the spring if that says anything."
735818,fish_fishburn,2012-10-11 12:23:00,1311,"I heard the Frabill is good quality. My brother is a motorcycle enthusiast and he swears by his bike raingear. He says its cheaper than fishing raingear and has much better closures since its designed for keeping the water out at hiway speed. Go into a bike shop and see what they have to offer. I have XTEREX but it is quite pricey, no complaints here."
735887,Fish Farmer,2012-10-11 17:31:00,2234,Buddy just called and he bought his today at Home Hardware in Caledonia $28.00 Say's it looks good for the price. I may have a look myself
735897,fishnsled,2012-10-11 18:09:00,3520,A couple of buddies have the BPS Gortex suits and have been happy with them for the last 3 seasons. . I bit cheaper than the 100mph suits. I ordered my suit from Cabelas (Guidewear) and have no complaints with the fit. Great suit as well.
735898,UglyBug,2012-10-11 18:14:00,148," BPS 100 MPH ,have had the set for 4 years now and love them. I bought mine in Florida and was able to mix and match the different sizes and colors to meet my requirement. Cabalas is also great stuff, Just keep in mind you don't want to skimp on something as important as rain gear.  Take the drive to toronto and see for yourself. They had a good selection last time i was there"
