736578,Luke V.,2012-10-15 17:12:00,286,Came home to this little guy hanging on the screen of my patio door. I was able to get really close to him/her.    As I have learned through the internet they are not common to my area (Niagara Region)  Feel Free to post any uncommon sightings you have seen this fall.

736673,DRIFTER_016,2012-10-15 22:28:00,10439,One of the rare sitings I had when I lived in Ontario was a Scarlet Tanager. I only ever saw one and it was on a fence rail near Grand Valley where I lived at the time.
