Buttocks clenched he performs a slow pirouette and gently slides off first the right welly boot, followed by the left. He then hunches his shoulders forward and in a classic striptease move lets his braces fall down from his shoulders to dangle by his hips over his corduroy trousers . Grabbing both sides of his checkered shirt he rips it apart to reveal his tea stained vest underneath and with a final flourish he hurls his flat cap onto a pile of hay. 'What on earth are you doing Bob?', says Garge. 'Lord tunderin' jeezuss, ye frightened the livin s*it out of me' says an obviously embarrassed Bob, ' me and the Missus been having some trouble lately in the bedroom department, and the Therapist suggested I do something sexy to a tractor.'"
