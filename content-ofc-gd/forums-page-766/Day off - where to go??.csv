Now silly season has died down on the Lake Ontario harbours, I was going to head to one of them but the main question is whether the fish that are there through the summer (not talking species like salmon here) are still around or do they move into the deeper water as things cool down?  Just trying to findout whether it's a complete waste of time or not really as I haven't fished fall over here yet.  Thanks"
