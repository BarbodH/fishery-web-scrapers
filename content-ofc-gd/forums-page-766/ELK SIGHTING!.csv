400495,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-09 01:32:00,0,elk or caribou>?
400497,troutboy,2009-11-09 01:34:00,125,"Bull elk, my friend got a shot of the the same bull from his stand 40yards away.Ill try to post it!"
400501,troutboy,2009-11-09 01:39:00,125,Here you go! 
400503,siwash,2009-11-09 01:42:00,683,That is a gorgeous animal... Where was this???
400504,troutboy,2009-11-09 01:45:00,125,We spotted this about 100km west of Thunder bay.
400512,siwash,2009-11-09 02:04:00,683," Do you think this is one of those animals from that Alberta heard or was it a ""native"" - did the MNR release in that area?"
400516,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-09 02:12:00,0,very cool.  how far is that away from where they released elk years back?
400520,cram,2009-11-09 02:18:00,1733,"I know its likely impossible but there was what looked a LOT like an elk taken down by wolves on my parents property SE of north bay.   Had wrapped its leg up in a fence and taken down...not sure if the wolves found it wrapped up or if it was backing up into the fence to get away from them.  I looked at what was left and could swear it was a young elk - but then, that's impossible......right?"
400523,Sandbag,2009-11-09 02:20:00,533,Very cool...and a great photo by your buddy.  Cheers  Craig  PS...how did the moose hunt go...???

400614,troutboy,2009-11-09 13:23:00,125,"Thanks, Im thinking it may be one of the lake of the woods elk, im not totaly sure on it.ps..the hunt went good!"
400616,Roy,2009-11-09 13:26:00,13728,"What a majestic animal!  ummmm, how tall a tree is your bud's stand in?"
400617,gaspumper,2009-11-09 13:28:00,393,"There are several living in a bush 1/2 mile north of Madoc on my buddys farm, he says they do a lot of damage to his fences."
400650,troutboy,2009-11-09 15:51:00,125,"He had a ground blind,he said the elk was looking at me while I yelled holy crap! He stayed feeding for about 5mins."
400815,siwash,2009-11-10 01:32:00,683,  they're obviously not wise to the ways of hunters yet since there's no open season!  two years off...  i wonder what they tast like>\?
400860,rickster,2009-11-10 03:19:00,495,Cool pic He probably is from the bunch released near Cameron Lake south of Kenora about ten or so years back they are pretty spread out now. there is a few hanging around just north of town here. Buddy found a shed this spring of a nice bull.
401068,gdelongchamp,2009-11-10 19:02:00,199,Nice picture.  Are you sure this was taken from a tree stand? Looks like a crouching ground postion to me.
401114,TJQ,2009-11-10 21:36:00,7806,Wow... cool pic.
401127,PAZE,2009-11-10 22:51:00,132,"I for one cant wait till theres a season on them, what a blast."
