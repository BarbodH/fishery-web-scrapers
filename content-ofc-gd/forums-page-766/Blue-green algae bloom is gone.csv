Testing by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment has verified that toxins do not persist in the water of the bay. This allows the Municipality of Callander to operate their two water plants, if necessary.  ""We are very pleased with the cooperation of the Municipality of Callander,"" said Peter Jekel, Director of Environmental Health. ""They handled the blue green algae situation well and took all the appropriate steps needed to protect the health of the area residents and visitors."""
