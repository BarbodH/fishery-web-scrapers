401051,addymark,2009-11-10 18:11:00,69,"any other symptoms other than the diarrhea and weight loss?  you mentioned no stomach pain, but have you noticed any other changes?  you best bet is to take a trip to a physician rather than researching on the internet.  There is so much information it may very well lead you in the wrong direction and you could be worried about a more sinister pathology.  Consulting with a fishing resource about your medical problems just shows that you are concerned with this, so the time you spend reading people's responses should be spent waiting for the doc."
401053,POLLIWOGG,2009-11-10 18:16:00,835,"Go see a doctor and don't forget to tell them you asked for medical advise from all your on line fishing buddies, insanity might be a symptom.  Upgrade to a better beer."
401057,Guest gbfisher,2009-11-10 18:27:00,0, I'd say its from the   Beer they make now a days. No doubt .....lite Beer....
401058,mbosh1980,2009-11-10 18:28:00,349,new food allergy maybe...
401061,JustinHoffman,2009-11-10 18:36:00,482,"Not that I am a Dr., but my best friend's brother had similar symptoms a few years back - was skinny as all hell (was always losing weight), constant trips to the bathroom, etc.. Well, he was diagnosed with Celiac disease - an allergy to gluten. Once he was on a gluten-free diet, he gained weight back, the toilet issues disappeared, and he regained his health.  Not saying this is your problem, but moreso, to highlight that it could be a number of things, and if left unchecked, can really do some damage.  Like others have said - go see a Dr. That's your best bet.  Good luck,  Justin"
401062,highdrifter,2009-11-10 18:42:00,2534,Maybe tapeworm or beaver fever??!!  Do yourself a favor;  have a doc run some tests...
401073,bubbles,2009-11-10 19:30:00,591," LOL  That's it!, you drink Lucky don't you......."
401074,badman187,2009-11-10 19:32:00,28,Better see a doc bro your sick.There is no way you can be losing weight by drinking more beer and eating fast food everyday.Are you working out and taking crank or some kind of supplements?
401084,NAW,2009-11-10 20:09:00,4022,  That would do it to ehh.  Crank and Lucky.  Yum..  Sounds like fun.
401086,I'mHooked,2009-11-10 20:14:00,525,"Yes, as mentioned above, it definitely sounds like tape worm.  Probably nothing shorter then a 24"" specimen with those symptoms!"
401092,fishermccann,2009-11-10 20:26:00,655,Smoking ( nicotine) is a laxative.

401188,Greencoachdog,2009-11-11 01:16:00,8163,"Any time you start losing weight and you're not trying to should be a   red flag!!! It could something as simple as an allergy or irratable bowel syndrome, or as serious as a bacterial infection or cancer!... but the longer you let an ailment go without treatment, the harder it will be to cure!!! A lot of people have lost their lives because they waited too long to seek treatment for an ailment!!!   As far as they wait at the doc's office goes, an office visit for me is 3-5 hours... and I have to pay for it!!!"
401202,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-11 02:01:00,2038,The biggest thing  '' Wrong ''  with you is you haven't been to the Doctor yet....
401217,T Fisher,2009-11-11 02:18:00,139,"You must see a Doctor. Any unxplained weight loss must be investigated 15lbs in a month yike's. I would say you're probably are suffering from a intestinal parasite. I can't remember the name of it but it comes from eating uncooked chicken. Have you ever ate wings in a bar and the bone is still red? i'ts also found in some Woman without getting to specific.  Solution: H-PACK they looks like horse pills over 8 days they will fix just about all that ails you.  You may have the beginnigs of crones / collites you need to go on a strict no beer diet, well cheap beer anyway. Check out there web sites for info.  Good luck"
401252,pike slayer,2009-11-11 04:20:00,1177,"ya i was never on any medical sites before and i was hoping for some ppl suggested and opinions and ideas are always nice. and i dont drink that cheap crap beer, usually its coors but ive been getting into the bud light lime alot lately and that stuff is pricey at $45 for a 24 of cans ouch!! i called the doctors office this morning and hes gone on vacation for the next month!! that must be nice! now the walk in clinic ooooo i'll definitely be dragging my feet walking in there!!"
401277,danbouck,2009-11-11 12:05:00,4380,"So you started eating fast food daily, you are drinking more, you started smoking and you are confused about why your health has went downhill?"
401279,Spiel,2009-11-11 12:09:00,9065,I think the general concensus here would be for you to see a Doctor. Nuff said.
400892,pike slayer,2009-11-10 04:26:00,1177,"ok so the past month or so my stomach has been screwy. every couple days ive been having diaherra and a loss of appetite, it goes away after a day or so then comes back. my stomach has not been really bothering me like no pain or anything and i dont feel sick and i havent been feeling tired well not more then normal after a days work. just over a month or so ago i weighted 160 and im down to 145lb!! thats 15lb in a month! that cant be good! the weird thing is my diet has changed a bit in the past month, ive been drinking more beer, eating fast food almost daily for lunch and i've pretty much started smoking which i never thought i'd do in my life time(it started with victory cigars fishing and after so many victories i got addicted) . the only thing i can think of is my body isnt liking the change and this is its way of rebelling. on the plus side and now i look great, no more beer gut and there has been alot more women that seem to be noticing me then before and my sex life has increased! does anyone have any ideas as to what is going on? ohh and im 22 if age has something to do with it! or does anyone know of websites where i can post something like this and get answers from knowledgable ppl like an online doctor?? thanks"
400893,Kinger,2009-11-10 04:30:00,351,
400894,GBW,2009-11-10 04:31:00,8460,the squirts could be from a food allergy (or a LOT of beer).  I never had any allergies growing up but in the past 10 years (now 36-yrs old) I am allergic to foods I loved. And stress can cause you to go through changes like that as well.
400895,pike slayer,2009-11-10 04:38:00,1177,"thanks for the link kinger! and gbw the beer hasnt been a huge increase, i dont binge drink to much but i have been going out on the town to bars alot more lately. maybe the women have been stressin me!?"
400896,timmeh,2009-11-10 04:43:00,609,"Most likely just a response to smoking and diet change, but you never know? If you're really looking for advice from a doctor, then go see one, don't count on online docs to give you knowledgeable advice."
400897,jayess,2009-11-10 04:43:00,187,"it goes without saying, but see a real doctor. it could be something minor, or it could be something serious. things like this you never know...  here's hoping all's well in the long haul for ya!"
400898,GBW,2009-11-10 04:44:00,8460,"work stress, $ stress it all adds up.  I was 185LB @ 6' tall and when my work situation got bad I went down to 168LB (but still 6' tall )  It can be many things so just go see your DR."
400899,pike slayer,2009-11-10 04:46:00,1177,ya i was thinking about seeing a doctor but im trying to do my own research and try and come up with a solution myself and try some different things and when those fail get to a doctor before it gets to worse
400902,GBW,2009-11-10 04:56:00,8460,why not just go see your DR?  It could be worse then what you think you find out online...
400903,redneck666,2009-11-10 04:56:00,563," lol. in this town its not all that easy to get a doctor. me and my family been here for about 2 1/2 years now and my father is the only one with a doctor cause his mother referred him to hers. me and the rest of my family have been on a waiting list for as long as we've been living here and so are a bunch of my friends and some of my relatives. i went to emerg. with a purple swollen ankle cause i was runnin around in the bush with my boots un-done (lol kinda stupid of me) and i had to sit in the waiting room for a good 3 hours and a person who was there after me (nothing wrong with them) got in before me. anyways thats my rant. and im not sure if Gavin has a Doc. either so, maybe he can see one without goin down to the walk-in and sittin forever."
400904,pike slayer,2009-11-10 05:00:00,1177,ya i have a family doctor and he works wednesday evenings so i have no excuse not to go really.
400906,timmeh,2009-11-10 05:10:00,609," Okay, well that is unfortunate and hopefully you can find a doc, and I have waited for hours before myself so I know it's real annoying, but.... waiting a couple hours is a small price if you're legitimately worried about your health.  Also, there is a number you can call anywhere in Ontario and talk to a nurse (think it's telahealth or something like that, but I can't recall). You'd have to search the web and find it but that maybe a better option for you."
400907,MJL,2009-11-10 05:10:00,2427,"Earlier this year (the month of June) I pretty much had what you’re going through except replace “every couple days” with “everyday, 20 times a day” for 3.5 weeks.  I had no pain, no cramping, no nausea, no real fatigue – In my case it was damn inconvenient and my sleep patterns were a little screwed up...Missed out on a carp fishing tourney and bunch of other trips.  My diet didn’t change.  I lost 7lbs in 2 weeks which doesn’t sound like much but for those who’ve met me in person, they know I didn’t have much weight to lose to begin with – I’m already stick thin and underweight as is.  My doctor thinks I might have had some sort of intestinal parasite (something like giardia or cryptosporidium – I doubt it though). By the time I finished a slough of blood tests, stool tests, abdominal and thyroid ultrasounds I no longer had the runs...My doc did say I might have other problems with my kidneys though.  See your family doctor if you can ASAP.  Could be a whole bunch of stuff which can be tested for like: Celiac disease (allergies to wheat), lactose intolerance (can’t drink milk or eat cheese), allergies to other certain foods, IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome), Intestinal parasites, mild case of bacteria poisoning, etc."
400908,pike slayer,2009-11-10 05:17:00,1177,"is IBS genetic? my mother has that, could it be passing down to me and just showing up now and affecting my body different??"
400916,StoneFly,2009-11-10 05:52:00,574,"That seems like ALOT in a month.  I dont have alot of faith in Canadian Doctors,...Try some of the websites,..just google in your conditions and you will find a wealth of info as well as Q&A blogs where real Doctors answer you and other people with the same issues.  That could take months going to see a doc.  Atleast it will give you an idea of what the possibilities are.  It definately sounds like a parasite, however there could be more serious things at work. Personally i like to go see the doc armed with education.  it can only help you to suggest things, it makes them look harder.  There are aLOT of reason you could be having what you are.  First step is get off the fast food, drink more water and well beer is beer, but do what you can to chill out.  Where is Dr Salvenius?  what kindof doctor is he anyways?  Foot?  nose and throat?  CMON,..you post here daily,..say smthn....or Im gonna start making fun of your little trout pics when you live in the God Given haven of trooooot and should have much better catches   lol...seriously Doc, chime in here,...these guys arent alone...."
400927,bigfish1965,2009-11-10 11:14:00,3382,"I just went through 8 days of salmonella poisoning....gawd that was nasty. But sounds like you have something more chronic. Go see a doc and get a scope and blood work done. When I first got sick, they asked for a 'sample' as they handed me a sample vial. I asked if it came with a funnel..lol."
400954,BITEME,2009-11-10 12:39:00,1968,22years old ...young Buck...yoyo weight....women noticing.......Id say you are RUTTING
400957,Spiel,2009-11-10 12:50:00,9065, LMAO....is that how it was for you Pete?
400963,MJL,2009-11-10 13:09:00,2427,"No clue if it's genetic WD...I guess it might be because I was asked if it ran in the family.   You do realize that ""Salvelinus"" = Char (as in brook trout and lakers)   Didn't they at least supply you with the popsicle sticks to start you off on your gold digging adventures?   Too funny!"
400965,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-10 13:14:00,1022,"Go see a doctor bud. 3 hours is considered good where i'm from. People wait up to 8 here. A hospital will take better care of you then a family doctor anyway. All the family doc will do is send you for tests and maybe give you some pills. Why not just cut to the chase and go to the hospital and they can do the tests that day and give you the required medication? For now I would not eat anything with fibre (whole wheats, whole grains, whole grain cereals, fruits), but strictly foods that are high on the glycemic index ie) white bread, white rice, pasta, potatoes. These foods take longer to break down, thus your less prone to bowel movements."
400992,troutologist,2009-11-10 14:57:00,951,"  I appreciate that. Can't muster the mettle to go downtown and catch decently sized fish becasue its not remote enough....he eats waa burgers and cries for dinner Ive heard.    WD, for someone 160 15lbs is alot of weight to drop in that period. Im all over not going to the doc but you best see ol' sawbones and see whats afoot. Can't chase fish or women when you're on IR."
400995,MJL,2009-11-10 15:03:00,2427, I heard he can examine your lamprey and get it back to life should it go dead and limp
400998,NAW,2009-11-10 15:12:00,4022,"I think you’ve answered your own question man.  Changing your diet, even in the slightest way, can really change other aspects of your body.  Smoking can do the same thing.  Everyone is different.  I changed my diet around for a 3 months period (cleanse).  I had the worst for a year after that.  Not kidding either, and full year if not more...  If I where you, I’d start to eat healthy and kick the smoking now, before it really screws you up.  Slow down on the beer too.  I went to the doc several times with my stomach issues.  (Well, a walk in clinic, if you consider those guys doctors).  They basically laughed me out of the office once I told them how hard I am on my body.  I was around your age when all this happened.  I went from 215lbs to 170lbs in three months."
401017,bubbles,2009-11-10 16:08:00,591,What is wrong with you? - you are asking for medical advice on a fishing board!  Go see a doctor.
401038,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-10 17:20:00,0,"  I am a doctor of charr catchology my friend. Is Lake Superior the ""god given haven"" of steelhead?  Last time I checked Lake Superior's fish were much smaller.   I should be making fun of the lack of fishing posts coming from you guys!  I'm envious of the size and numbers of steel down south.  Up here the population is naturally reproducing but in much colder, less productive water, and with a healthy native lake trout population to compete with.  While we do get the odd beauty, our ""average fish"" are around 2-4 lbs with some 6-8lbers being our BIG ones.  My fish averaged 6-8 lbs on the salmon river in pulaski!   If you want big trout pics you'll have to wait until brookies and lakers re-open in January!   As far as your malady, as others have suggested, I'd recommend a trip to the doctor just to be sure although you said ""increase in beer and fast food"" and that COULD be causing you hard times.  Trust me, I'm a doctor."
