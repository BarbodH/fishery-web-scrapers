401384,Spiel,2009-11-11 18:25:00,9065,"Due to the overwhelming negativity of the replies I wasn't going to view the clip and now all I can say is why, why did I do it? I may never forgive you for this Craig."
401386,bubbles,2009-11-11 18:34:00,591,"I stuck a fork in my eye once, sounded the same"
401391,Cookslav,2009-11-11 18:58:00,1457,Are they serious?....I totally took that as a spoof.  Its so ridiculous they must know its horrible....they must?
401393,irishfield,2009-11-11 19:04:00,26272,"Nice rack for her age.....  ..or is that the ""plastic"" part of the album title??"
401416,aniceguy,2009-11-11 20:27:00,1094,I was sorts thinking the same but didnt wanna admit it lol
401421,Roy,2009-11-11 20:33:00,13728,"Ok, how many people kept the clip and put it in their bookmarks/favourites?"
401443,craigdritchie,2009-11-11 21:47:00,1586,"She may sound like a cat in a blender, but I hope I can still move like that (and look that healthy)  at  *cough*  76 years old."
401452,wuchikubo,2009-11-11 22:04:00,1114,"I was truly not going to believe it could be that bad, but......... now I can't understand how anyone could listen and watch that longer than the 1m:04sec that I could bear. That was truly awful. I'm still getting shivers thinking about it as I type this.  Glad I didn't watch the whole thing."
401076,craigdritchie,2009-11-10 19:40:00,1586,"Lots of serious thoughts this week as we commemorate Remembrance Day and think about Canadians presently in Afghanistan ......... so this might be a good time for a chuckle. This is Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band performing on the Jimmy Fallon show last week. Yoko may have her strengths, but singing definitely isn't one of them.

401077,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-10 19:49:00,0,yoko has strengths?
401078,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-10 19:49:00,0,that was definitely painful.
401079,Roy,2009-11-10 19:50:00,13728,"Thanks Craig....back later, looking for a barf emoticon."
401080,Joey,2009-11-10 19:52:00,9122,"Wow, I'm actually speechless."

401096,BUSTER,2009-11-10 20:37:00,1336,"I heard it on stern, wow,,  but if  you think about it , great marketing ploy"
401112,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-10 21:27:00,2038,Yoko ono =

401123,dave524,2009-11-10 22:26:00,4508,"I am not going there, unfortunately I had the misfortune of seeing her perform once and that was enough. It was my first year of University. I lived on campus just a couple of hundred yards south of Varsity Stadium and there was a great lineup at a rock concert there the first weekend after I moved in. Even my favourite artist Eric Clapton was onstage with her and John at that time but it still sounded like some one torturing a cat.  On the bright side I did get to see the Doors and a lot of other great acts of those times.  http://rockandrollrevival.tripod.com/"
401132,TJQ,2009-11-10 23:16:00,7806,"Im never gonna get that time back, am I???"
401138,misfish,2009-11-10 23:36:00,29133,  That was her recreation of her last orgazim with John.
401141,Twocoda,2009-11-10 23:38:00,4130,   in the words of Meatloaf......ya took the words right out of my mouth...   holy crap ...is this somekinda new music i just dont understand????  music is supposed to make you feel something ....but ....my testicles tighting to the point of pain ????
401144,aniceguy,2009-11-10 23:42:00,1094,"craig thanks for that one...next time I see you on a river your swimmin lol that was actually painful, funny part is my dog started to howl now that was funny"
401205,craigdritchie,2009-11-11 02:04:00,1586,"I'm still in a state of disbelief. Louis, my apologies to your dog."
401235,aniceguy,2009-11-11 03:09:00,1094,"explain it to cookie she is scared for life now...I dont know if she can handle the emotional scaring  you be the judge, I think you owe cookie a doggie treat lmao  "
401236,Fang,2009-11-11 03:16:00,1330,"2 cats and a possum are clawing at my back gate trying to get as far away as possible  she's just plain awful, and I like wierd music  but as I always said love is blind and there must be some talent hidden there (just not singing)"
401237,John Bacon,2009-11-11 03:18:00,3277,"Funny thing is, the people in the audience were clapping... where did they find those people?"
401270,Stern Rules,2009-11-11 08:21:00,342,I heard this on Stern too and I don't need to see the video. The audio was waaaaay to much. What the hell was that?
401271,ChrisK,2009-11-11 08:41:00,2772,What the....
401294,craigdritchie,2009-11-11 13:17:00,1586,"I heard it on the Stern show too and just had to look it up - it's hard to turn away from a train wreck.  The drummer's face is just priceless, as he realizes he's on national TV, and will probably never get a woman again."
401301,Jer,2009-11-11 13:36:00,1426,  You watched the entire 5:20? I could only stand about 2:00.  That may have been the worst thing I have ever heard...
