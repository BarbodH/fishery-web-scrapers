399227,Joey,2009-11-04 03:45:00,9122,"So there's a new contest hosted by WFN called:  ""WFN's A Great Day for Fishing with Joe Mercurio Contest""  I wonder if I could borrow a few votes from y'all.  I'd love to go fishing with Joe down in Florida, sounds like it would be awesome.  They asked for one of your fav days of fishing, so I posted the day I caught that huge carp on Lake Simcoe on New Years Day when Paul and I ice fished with Terry, that was a blast!!  Here is the link if anyone could send a vote my way.  I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks in advance  Vote Here  Joey"
