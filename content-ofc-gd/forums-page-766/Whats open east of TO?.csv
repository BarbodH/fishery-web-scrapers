I am gonna be in Toronto this weekend, and I talked the girlfriend into letting me slip out for some early morning fishing I want east of TO to Bowmanville, Wilmot, somewhere like that. What part of the streams are still open. Is it still the same as it use to be from the CNR to the lake.  Thanks guys  Cheers"
401071,ehg,2009-11-10 19:19:00,2666,"From what i could gather from Duffins eastward at least to Wilmot the season is still open from HWY 2 south to the lake until Dec. 31st , then it is CNR south from Jan. 1st onwards. Thought it was a recent change as well but apparently not. Good Luck"
