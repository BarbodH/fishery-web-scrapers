400999,BITEME,2009-11-10 15:12:00,1968,Good Morning All  At some point this winter I was thinking of doing a step by step water pump change on my 50hp 4 stroke I dont need to change it but figured I would do it with pictures since it always comes up and people want to know . They are pretty much all the same. Also we are putting the rescue boat to sleep on the weekend and we will be winterizing a pair of 4.3l if there is interest in this I will also put some pictures together with a write up. I will gauge responce on whether to do this or not. Im not a pro but sort of in the know.  Just a Thought Peter  Oh yeah here is a fishy pic just in case you dont think I fish(afterwork for a few mins)6inch husky jerk
