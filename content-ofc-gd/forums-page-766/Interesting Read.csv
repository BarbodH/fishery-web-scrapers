401377,Roy,2009-11-11 17:58:00,13728,Good find ADB. This has been going on for years. I buy a lot of fish in a month so I have 3 places who I trust to sell me what I'm paying for.

It's pretty scary when lab scientists can't even identify a fish by comparing genetic samples against ""the most comprehensive database that has ever been constructed.""  Good grief!  As someone who really believes you are what you eat, that's truly alarming.  I think I may go walleye fishing this weekend."
