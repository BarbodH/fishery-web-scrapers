I picked up an entry level musky rod/reel, a membership, line, and a top raider for about $150.  http://www.lebaron.ca/english/nov_09%20sale.pdf  * I'm in no way affiliated with lebarons, just thought OFC'ers would like a deal as much as i do."
400656,Roy,2009-11-09 16:18:00,13728,Thanks for the heads up. Which rod and reel did you get?
400657,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-09 16:22:00,1022,"how do you become a club member, and how long does it take?"
400661,mbosh1980,2009-11-09 16:29:00,349,"roy, i got a daiwa heartland 2 pc 6'6"" heavy paired with an abu garcia c3 5500.  A bit small for monsters but I'm more likely to use it for pike and (hopefully) big bass  than muskie. I think its an ok setup to get me started on a budget.  what are your thoughts? I needed a two piece rod for transportability.  4eyes i signed up at the cash ($25) and it took about 2 mins."
400662,GBW,2009-11-09 16:29:00,8460,"cool, thanks!!!  I was going to head over at lunch today and look at a new reel, now I have to go... To be a club member you pay $25.00, get a card that is good for 1-year from the day you get it and get 10% off everything not on sale in store.  You just have to have your card with you when you shop to get the 10% off. No, I don't work there or have anything to do with them either..."
400901,GBW,2009-11-10 04:55:00,8460,"OK, I so I go in looking for a new reel today and get one (not what I had in mind as the sales person was very helpful).  the problem is I left with a reel, rod, spool of line and a few more lures AND I missed some things so I have to go back tomorrow.  working so close to the Markham store is not a good thing for my wallet..."
