401147,misfish,2009-11-10 23:45:00,29133,"My plan today was to walk in and retrieve my card from the trail cam after work,then move it back out to the field. So I do just that.As I walk out of the greens in the bush,then into the hardwoods,I jump a big doe.I quickly grab my grunt call out of my jacket and give a few calls.She settles down and stops.I watch here for a minute.I decide to see how close I can get to her,when all of a sudden,this big buck jumps out from the same spot.Im thinking they were doing the thing.  That was all it took,they were both on thier way, back deep into the far greens.   Stupid stupid me,  I should know better then not going in without my bow.  Ohwell,atleast I know there are still some animals around.  The cam produced some turkeys.Yeah,they know the season has passed dont they.LOL  Looks like I need to fix the time on the cam.     "
401149,Twocoda,2009-11-10 23:49:00,4130,lol....kinda like peeing off the boat...... when the far rod is going off....
401185,Leecher,2009-11-11 01:10:00,7832,tsk tsk tsk Brian.... you should know better At least you know that there are some deers roaming around Now go get that big boy you just spooked Jacques
401194,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-11 01:41:00,348,You'll get em Brian!
401207,Skud,2009-11-11 02:07:00,739,I still haven't changed the time on my camera either. I retrieved my card today also. I had some Does coming in at 4:30pm yesterday and a new young buck show himself but again only at night.  I would take note of the spot those deer came out of that you spooked. They may bed down on a regular basis in that spot. With the right wind you may be able to put a stalk on them.
401213,Terry,2009-11-11 02:15:00,14456,LOL
401216,TJQ,2009-11-11 02:17:00,7806,Keep on ' em bud... you will prevail!!
401224,rickster,2009-11-11 02:28:00,495,DOH! At least you know the buck is still around Went in to switch cards in my cams today and saw four doe in the field. They just walked off into the bush (must be getting used to me or they knew I had some apples for them) Got these two pics off the one cam Haven't set the clock back on the cam yet got tomorrow off...can you guess where i will be at dawn The was also a pic of a big doe in between these two pics. I'm thinking he was following her around the salt lick         Hope to post a buck down report tomorrow Hope you get that buck Brian  rick
401466,Big Cliff,2009-11-11 23:01:00,6899,"Silly, if you had taken your bow, they would have left before you got to see them. Deer ar smart, they know when you have your bow with you how else do you explain the fact that you always see them when you don't have it and never see them when you do? They go to school for that stuff you know!  I can drive my bike down into the field in the middle of the day where my stand is and see 3 or 4 right in front of my stand. Get in there and sit all day and see nothing. They KNOW!  That is one fine looking buck yum yum! Hope to see your post down post soon!"
401502,misfish,2009-11-12 00:02:00,29133,"Cliff, you speak the truth my friend. Those animals are smart. Had a guy at work say to myself and a few other hunters.Im going to get my hunting lic,and show you how it,s done.We all just laughed and said,yeah,OK.LOL"
