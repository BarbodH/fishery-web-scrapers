400538,snag,2009-11-09 03:07:00,1932,"I’m not sure what to do here because my evidence is circumstantial.  Like I’ve said before: OFC needs a security screening program for its members (excluding myself) I’ll let the few pictures I found on my camera speak for themselves.  Met up with GBW or “psycho Geoff” as I now call him. He was all smiles and happy, happy when we met. Gradually, I noticed he seemed kinda anxious and would snap at little things quite quickly. I ignored it and chalked it up to another miserable internet relationship bound for avoidance.  I’ll cut to the chase. I’m having some difficulties remembering what happened. The pics left on my camera have helped put the pieces back together......  Happy, happy, guy smiley, I’m your best bud-Geoff.   We aren’t having much luck and my date is growing increasingly agitated/violent. Suddenly, “fish on!”, I cry! It looks pretty good. I'm stoked!   As I’m reeling it in, I recall raising my hand for a “high five” from Geoff Geoff raises his hand to oblige.........   Then, blackness   When the light returns my head is spinning and something sticky and red is in my hair.   Geoff is laughing and screaming at me to stop napping and to get the camera ‘cause he’s got a fish on! Strange, HE'S HOLDING MY NEW ROD AND REEL!  I ask if we could go to the hospital. He laughs and plays the fish.   I ask again, meekly, about a hospital trip. He snarls with gritted teeth, ""TAKE THE PICTURE MAGGOT""   Stumbling back to the car I decide to ""brain"" him with my pliers.   But then I thought ""hey, we didn't get skunked!""  Guess we can fish again Geoff.  Congrats on your first T.O. pike buddy  S."

400887,ehg,2009-11-10 04:18:00,2666,"Another T.O pike report with a twist, have to give it a try sometime but never do. Are the fish still hitting in the late fall down there?"
401007,mepps,2009-11-10 15:52:00,1301,"Never turn your back on a fisherman man!  And for once, I have absolutely no clue where that spot is!"
401130,snag,2009-11-10 23:09:00,1932," Yup, that alllllll you need!   That's EXACTLY what it was too! Well done   We live to please you   Gracias!   Just keep a safe distance and everything is cool.   Hey Erik, That was at the same spot we last saw each other. Just over in the East Bay.   It's tricky, next time you're in town we'll go."
401152,GBW,2009-11-10 23:53:00,8460,but you failed to tell them what you offered me at the end of the day...
