398757,fishhunter,2009-11-02 22:02:00,604,I found 2 great places for dinners in picton this season if any one wants names ill post them. We could also do a big group dinner thing sat night.
398775,douG,2009-11-02 22:37:00,2693,"It sounds like my plans are falling into place too, with Memart accepting gas money for the boat and  Mike the Pike and GlenK steeling themselves with free earplugs and a share in the rent.  Fishhunter, being a local, is the best choice for a group dinner on Saturday.  I like that idea.  We could leave the reservation until Friday when we have a better count.  "
398970,Headhunter,2009-11-03 13:43:00,5703,"It would be cool to over run a local restaurant with OFC'ers, but speaking from experience at these GTG's, my guess would be that some of the folks coming, may be too drive to drunk. Better left at the cottage! HH"
398982,fishhunter,2009-11-03 14:34:00,604,lol you may be right but for those of us that go to have fun and fish with out getting drunk it would still be nice. A good place to go is on the main st. its called Gus's http://www.restaurantica.com/on/picton/gus...urant/23012980/
398995,Headhunter,2009-11-03 15:11:00,5703,"Gus's was good the last time I went there, just be sure to STAY AWAY from that ""Family Restaurant"" next to or near McDonalds... can you say cook, re-heat and repeat! Oh and by the way Lloyd, drunks are people to, ya know! LMAO HH"

401390,Headhunter,2009-11-11 18:55:00,5703,"Lex, the smoke only bothers you for the first couple of days, after that, you are pretty much accustomed to it! Let us know if you change your mind, you are welcome. HH"

None.  This will be another celebration of the cycle of the seasons, diminished by our absent friends.  But never mind that, can we get a roll call?  Please post to this, saying where your group is and who you is.   If you need help with the rent or boat gas and have some space, make a note of that too.  I think we meet for a meal on Saturday night, at Shoeless Joe's, see ya there."
