400367,lew,2009-11-08 14:27:00,12766,"Thanks Terry  It's sad that some don't get it, but fortunate that most do.  We owe so much to so many."
400372,John,2009-11-08 14:41:00,2956,Thanks Terry.  I share a few silent moments each Remembrance Day with a close friend who lost his Dad in WW2.  We DO owe so much to so many....

400379,carp-starter,2009-11-08 15:27:00,253,"Thank you Terry.  I thank the young men and women who are overseas right now. They are offering the their lives for us. For this, I thank them and will always think about them. I will never forget.  I also think about the veterans - especially WW2.  If they were not across the pond fighting for our freedom, I might not be here right now typing this post. I was born there at that time.  Thank you. I will never forget.  carp-starter"
400381,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-08 15:48:00,2582,Thx Terry. That pretty much sums it up.  God bless them all.
400402,Danubian,2009-11-08 19:35:00,65," Perhaps for most of them the two World Wars were just 2 little paragraphs in some odd history textbook, that they didn't read anyway. One comes to wonder how is this much different than the fact that more and more often the Christmas is being replaced by the ""Winter Holidays""?  Sad or not, it's a sure sign of our times..."
400631,irishfield,2009-11-09 14:39:00,26272,"Thanks Terry....  Means a lot in our family and while clearing stuff from Mom's farm house yesterday, with my Brother (Gulf War Vet), we found our Father's platoon picture and his service medal from WWII. Neither of which I'd ever seen..."

I think it should be all across Canada at least till noon.  Personally, I cant see myself shopping at 11 o'clockish on Remembrance Day    "

401315,Tom McCutcheon,2009-11-11 14:29:00,627,Bumped up once more. Very fitting Terry and the first time I have seen this video. I will remember  the sacrifices that the men and women of the armed forces make each day.    Then and now. I write this just before heading down town for our own services in Peterborough to remember the dead.  Respectfully  Tom.
