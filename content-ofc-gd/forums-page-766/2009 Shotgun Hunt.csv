400420,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-08 21:56:00,348,"Thanks man....I'm usually really good with my aim...it may have been because that was the first ever buck that I saw in person...who knows...but thanks for the congrats. Last year, on this gun I had tru glo sights on them...one broke off and I didn't replace them, so there's just the beeds on the top of this gun...I went shootin' just before my moose hunt, fired 6 slugs at 80 yards and bullseye on all 6.  I just finished skinning it in the garage and there were two shots in it....one of them not so good  I still have one more tag for my bow...at least that one has a scope on it!"
400423,richyb,2009-11-08 22:30:00,774,Congrats on the deer. Everyone thinks that hunting is like it is on the TV shows and thats bull crap. Not every deer is standing perfect broadside and a perfect shot made. In the real world there is running/ bounding/ un optimal shots but they can also get the job done. NICE BUCK
400440,Leecher,2009-11-08 23:12:00,7832,"Appreciate the added explanation AzuluSpookd but to me, was not necessary..... what really matters is that you have yourself venison for the next little while  You did good and it doesn't get any better than that!!! Again great job man!!! Leechman"

400636,GeorgeJ,2009-11-09 15:07:00,207,"  Exactly, if you don not have a clean vital organ shot and I know it's the hard to do but wait for the next one. Nobody wants an animal to suffer needlessly and I'm sure you didn't either, but this one probably did. Another thing that may have helped is to have waited a half hour or so after your shot before tracking down the animal allowing it to settle down and die."
400726,fishinfool,2009-11-09 20:54:00,366," I guess it's a matter of who you are and how ethical you are when you hunt. I personally would never shoot at a ""running/bounding"" deer. Those shots are for the rednecks that are all about getting a deer on the meat pole no matter what the cost to the animal. All my hunting partners pride themselves in the one shot one kill rule and none of them would ever make an ""un optimal"" shot as you call it."
400774,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-09 23:36:00,348,....Happy Hunting to all  .
400792,Fisherman,2009-11-10 00:27:00,7201,"Don't go running to buy that rifled barrel yet, have you looked at the ""saddle scope mounts""? I have one on my Browning BPS, a run of mill, a.k.a. cheapy Tasco scope,  with a bit of patience and perseverance, 3-4"" groups at 80m with just regular remington 2 3/4 slugs."
400795,Sinker,2009-11-10 00:30:00,8692,"I have a rifled barrel for sale right now if your interested. Its a remington, 3"", fully rifled, with iron sights. I've only shot it at targets, never hunted it. Maybe 20 shots thru it. Mint shape, asking $200.  Pm if your interested.  S."
400806,Moosebunk,2009-11-10 00:57:00,3970,"Cool Zulu!!!  You don't report often enough, but when ya do, ya make it count.  Always enjoy the hunting threads this time of year... and this one was no different."
400135,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-07 02:38:00,348,"Well...certainly was in interesting morning! Got off work at 0500, checked the wind, perfect, decided on where I was going to set up. Went home, grabbed my gear and headed over to Wayne's. The walk in took a little longer than normal, as the leaves had dried out and I didn't want to spook anything. Set up underneath some overhanging pines, on the edge of a small field on top of a hardwood ridge. I was at this spot the day before and counted quite a few scrapes.  I could start to see clearly about 0635 and did a few small grunts. About 0650 I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye and all of a sudden here comes a buck  ...didn't really care how big or small he was, just knew it was a buck!!  He was a good distance away, but moving away from me...so bang...he didn't move...looked at me...I'm thinking...huh?...bang...he starts running into bush, starting to go down the ridge..stops...looks at me again...bang...I've had to have hit him....I waited and I started walking over...blood...nice....I could still hear him in the bush...oh no...waited...started walking...I see him get up and go..this goes on for quite a bit, finally he's down at the bottom near the swamp still walking around....I get to within 20 yards and I can see him through the thicket........I then realize I have NO MORE SLUGS   ...oh oh....I waited for two hours watching him when he finally expired....went over and was pleasantly surprised.  I hike all the way back to the top and go and visit Wayne...he asked if it was me and I said, it sure was...however I heard alot more shots throughout the morning...he got this four wheeler and met me down there and we got that buck out...took a bit, but we got her out. Sat and chatted for a while, when I realized how tired I was getting from working all night!   Said my many thanks to Wayne and told him I would be back next week with some nice venison for him and Leah...along with some wine.  Thanks again Wayne!          "
400136,rickster,2009-11-07 02:43:00,495,Nice buck congrats...   oh and by the way ...for your wifes sake I hope in that second pic the gun isn't loaded...  again congrats  Rick
400137,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-07 02:49:00,348,Thanks rickster! Remember....I ran out of slugs
400138,rickster,2009-11-07 02:51:00,495,  I hear they have a little blue pill for that now!!!!!!   Sorry it was too easy
400139,Terry,2009-11-07 02:55:00,14456,nice going
400140,misfish,2009-11-07 02:57:00,29133,Nice job Marty.Congrats bud. It sure was crunchy and slippery this morning.
400141,irishfield,2009-11-07 03:03:00,26272,Hill doesn't look that steep in the picture.. why didnt you just carry it up? LOL  Does look shallow...but trust me lads it's a 45 degree or better slope and thankfully the winch cable was 3 wraps longer than needed !  Gonna sight your gun in before next hunt ??
400142,Mattones,2009-11-07 03:05:00,587,Congrads on the buck! Although i am happy the hunt is over and hope to god my buck is still around
400148,Skud,2009-11-07 03:18:00,739,Way to get'r done. Congrat's
400154,ch312,2009-11-07 04:06:00,1590,"congrats  you sure are lucky you didnt lose this buck. you should never push a deer and it would have been much wiser to back off for a couple hours before tracking once you saw blood. pushing a deer is the main reason people lose deer. he would have laid down and died the first time he stopped if you hadnt pushed him. luckily he didnt go too far and you were able to find him.  im not trying to bring you down or nothing, but following up too quickly is the worst thing you can do."
400158,Cookslav,2009-11-07 04:20:00,1457,"So I gotta ask....  How many shots hit the mark LOL! Was it the first, second, or 3rd shot that counted"
400161,Sinker,2009-11-07 04:35:00,8692,"Nice buck !!!  I always bring way too much ammo, but I've never run out!!  S."
400173,Fisherman,2009-11-07 12:23:00,7201,Who's making the mashed potatoes..looks good..
400187,wuchikubo,2009-11-07 14:43:00,1114,Congrats on the buck!
400219,fishinfool,2009-11-07 19:25:00,366,"Just a question! Where do you shoot a deer that is heading away from you? Three shots, I have never shot a deer that took more than one shot and it was always in the mortal wound area. If it took the deer two hours to expire, I would have to say that the shot should have been re-thought or passed on completely. Looking at the pics tells me that the deer was shot somewhere in the haunch area and suffered a long and painful death. Sorry to put a damper on your buck but I am surprised more hunters on this site have not spoken up already. Firing a few shots at a paced off tree at up to 80 or 90 yds prior to the hunt would help this immensely IMHO. Not trying to start a war, just think that hunters should try for the one well placed shot, one kill scenario."
400222,Burtess,2009-11-07 19:30:00,901," I was going to say the same thing, but was worried about getting flak for it.  Getting my nuts blown off and waiting a couple hours to croak sucks IMO....  Burt"
400231,Sinker,2009-11-07 20:52:00,8692,"At least he got the deer. If it was lost, it would be a different story. Always smart to carry extra ammo, you never know what will happen out there.  The second picture is scary. Whether the gun is loaded or not, having a shotgun pointed at me, closed with no safety on isn't going to happen. EVer. Period.  BTW, keep your orange on too!!  Congrats again Marty, I know you haven't been hunting long, so you gotta learn somehow. I learned a lot of things the hard way, its the best way IMO.  S."
400239,Leecher,2009-11-07 21:27:00,7832,Congrats on your harvest AzuluSpookd Beauty buck Thanks for sharing Leechman
400240,misfish,2009-11-07 21:34:00,29133,"  Just amagine the carnage the shooters cause,  shooting at dogged running deer.  I never heard so much shooting as I did this  year.You would think there was a hundred of them running around.  But yes,I am a believer of one shot,one kill. Marty did well to not lose track of the deer.  Congrats again bud.  Good points Sink."
400268,T Fisher,2009-11-08 00:15:00,139,One shot b-4 the hunt will show you if the gun shoots where you are aiming. Your lucky you retrived the gut shot deer. Adrenaline will make the meat as tough as leather.  Gongrat's on the Deer.
400276,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-08 01:06:00,2038,Wow  ..  Sounds like some Deer hunters only need to bring one Bullet with them...   Congrats on your success..
400297,misfish,2009-11-08 02:10:00,29133," No one is saying, you need to bring one bullet or slug or shell. What I believe most are saying is,a more higher percentage shot,should be taken.  You can stop    now."
400355,IndySKS,2009-11-08 13:43:00,134,"  And some need to bring more than 3 !   I'm not going to comment on your shooting skills or choice of shot,  I'm just glad you recovered the deer, congrats nice buck"
400395,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-08 18:06:00,348,"Fishinfool....to answer your question....when I look to the left he's walking towards me....then he gets directly in front of me and continues walking, which means going away....to my right....I understand what your saying and it probably sounded as if he was walking directly away from the front of me, but that wasn't the case. Either way, as Shayne said...you live and learn.  Last year's Doe was a perfect shot placement. Last year's moose was a perfect shot placement, even at 250 yards. This year, well...something went wrong. Could be excitement, who knows.  Do I wish I could have placed that shot perfectly? Absolutely. Did I try to? Absolutely. I didn't but I was lucky enough to recover the deer.  Thanks to all who congratulated me, it certainly was a great morning.  One thing I do know, is after this year, I will be getting a deer gun, with a rifled barrel and a scope!!!!"
400419,Cookslav,2009-11-08 21:48:00,1457,"Hey Bud,  You shot it, you tracked it you recovered it... It sounds like you felt like you could make the shot count so I say Congrats. For the record I was just curious/joking about your aim LOL!  Did you end you hitting it more then once?"
