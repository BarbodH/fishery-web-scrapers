400701,BITEME,2009-11-09 19:14:00,1968,"I had a major issue with my truck and went to war with Japeneese Engineers. I didnt recieve the part I needed till later Saturday afternoon and needed to have it all back together Sunday. I was still closed up in my shop doing battle it needed to be done so that I would know if I had more work ahead of me on Sunday. By 0200 all was back together and I dragged my sorry butt to bed. Sunday was trial day and all worked well. Best part of this whole job I only had 2 screws left. If anyone has changed a heater core before they know were I am coming from with this it is one of the first things they put on a vehicle when they build it. Heater Core $500.00 Removal and replacment of the dash of a Toyota 4 Runner 20 hrs 4 litres of antifreeze $20.00 ,skin loss and dna transfeer free , doing it all yourself and saving $1600.00.....Priceless  Oh got a few pike to boot had to bike it though( just little 2 footers) The Victim  The Weapons  The Surgery The Recovery The Celebration   Cheers Biteme "
400715,BITEME,2009-11-09 19:50:00,1968,here they are sorry for the repeat   
400716,Terry,2009-11-09 19:57:00,14456,"nasty job I had to have mine done I didn't have the place or time to do it myself...garage said 1000 bucks to remove the dash, then the price to remove and replace the heater core......  my butt still hurts..."
400717,BITEME,2009-11-09 19:59:00,1968,My whole body hurts from contorshinism but I dont feel lighjter so thats good
400719,Raf,2009-11-09 20:02:00,3495,"if its any consolation, the american engineers don't do a much better job.  the interior would look similar on my jeep if i had to replace the core."
400724,SBCregal,2009-11-09 20:47:00,688,"should've pulled the seats out...way more room to move around, and not much work really.  i run when i see jobs like this come into the shop!"
400732,Sandbag,2009-11-09 21:09:00,533,WOW...you're more of a man than me....LOL  Gotta be some satisfaction after getting it all back together though..  Nice job  Cheers  Craig
400733,kemper,2009-11-09 21:11:00,2232,"Yikes.  I have a motor teardown to do on my car...idle is all wrong. Thing is, I don't really feel like doing it. So hopefully the old beater gets through the winter and then Ill just get a new one...lol"
400736,FLEX ROD,2009-11-09 21:17:00,394,"Hats off, never would I think of even attempting a job like that. Gret job, good on you.  FLEX"
400739,shane,2009-11-09 21:33:00,652,Good for you.  I would have just got a thicker winter coat.
400741,fishinfool,2009-11-09 21:40:00,366,"Just think biteme The next time you do it, you will probably do it in half the time. lol A job well done!"
400745,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-09 21:49:00,2582,"I'm in awe when I see such things.  I have my chest PUFFED way out when I assemble a new BBQ. And am darn surprised when it actually works after assembly...cause I usually have bags of spare parts and screws I didn't use  Give yourself a pat on the back, relax and have yourself a beer. You earned it."
400761,BITEME,2009-11-09 22:42:00,1968,  Could be a vaccum leak....now dont shoot me for this but get a propane tourch and lift your hood open the gass on the tourch and vent gas on all the vaccum lines you have to take your time because it takes a little bit to get to the motor the ne will make your motor race a bit  and youve found the leak My 2 cents
400762,BITEME,2009-11-09 22:50:00,1968,"I cant take all the credit for this, although I learned alot in life, the internet is an amazing tool. it cant turn wrenchs for you or FISH but you certainly pick the brains of a whole lot of people at the same time.And then there is a place like this with VERY COOL PEOPLE   THANKS Peter"
400764,Roy,2009-11-09 23:04:00,13728,AHHHHHHHHH Hush up Peter. Take it as a compliment and move on!
400802,chandru,2009-11-10 00:46:00,63,"ouch that's some serious cash, i should start a repair savings fund before i buy a truck..."
400805,douG,2009-11-10 00:54:00,2693,We are all SO proud.  And a hearty AttaBoy to Peter.  I wouldn't have known where to start.
400867,kemper,2009-11-10 03:36:00,2232, I was thinking IACV or its in need of a cooling system purge... but vac leak is also a likely culprit and Ill have a look thanks!
400919,pikehunter,2009-11-10 09:51:00,1659,"last time I had heater core issues was with an '89  Corsica, I couldn't believe the stupidity of engineers burying it under the dashboard! Yes it did cost a good chunk of change to have a shop do the work.  My first experience with a heater core replacement was so simple! It was a '71 Ford Custom 500 with a 302 motor, predecessor to the recent Ford 5 litre.  The whole job cost me 15 bucks! Just had to pop the hood, undo 2 heater hoses into the firewall, remove a few screws, pop out the core and take it into the rad shop that used to be at the corner of Brant and Grahams Lane in Burlington. Get it recored, pay the dude 15 bucks and take it back home and replace it. Ahhh so simple...why are cars so complicated anymore  My hats'   off to you for accomplishing such a PIT   job."
400968,cuzza,2009-11-10 13:31:00,467," cleaning the IACV is a good place to start but it could be a temperature sensor, that would cause the idle to go up and down if the engine can't work out whether it's hot or cold.  Good job on the heater Biteme, hope you don't end up with loads of rattles after taking the dash out!"
400993,johnnyb,2009-11-10 14:59:00,3413,"Nicely done, BiteMe...I hope you won't be letting your son drive the truck any time soon..."
