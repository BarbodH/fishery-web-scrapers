We got up to camp before dark on Friday, and went in with an inch of snow on the ground.  Saturday was cloudy, but Sunday was likely the best day we've had all fall, we managed 9 birds over the course of the weekend and put a lot of mileage on the bike.  heres some pic's.                       Hoping to head up one last time next weekend with the wifey!!"
