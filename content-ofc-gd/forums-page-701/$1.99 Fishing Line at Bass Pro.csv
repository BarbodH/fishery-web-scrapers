454095,John Bacon,2010-04-10 00:34:00,3277,Bass Pro is selling Rapala fishing line for $1.99 a spool.  They have an assortment of 6 to 17 pound test... mostly 8 pound test.
454112,fish_fishburn,2010-04-10 01:09:00,1311,Sounds like the perfect line to use as backing for all the cp guys out there.
454122,waterwolf,2010-04-10 01:24:00,556,"i tried a spool a few years back but was disappointed because of very high memory , found it hard to work with, tie'n knots an' such. might be a different animal of late, don't know never went back."
454128,bassman87,2010-04-10 01:30:00,586,sounds like it'll be good for arts and crafts. bead bracelet anyone?
454134,Fang,2010-04-10 01:39:00,1330,The Rapala Tough line is very high memory. Although I've been running 20 lb on my riggers and it as good as my old standby Maxima green  If you can get a hold of any of the Finesse line it's much better and at that price it's good for a few trips and then change it out
454145,John Bacon,2010-04-10 02:04:00,3277, It is the Finesse line that they are selling.
454193,Cudz,2010-04-10 03:58:00,2652,I wouldn't even use it as backing.  That is all I am going to say about that.
454196,Stern Rules,2010-04-10 04:25:00,342,"Last year they had the tough, finesse and long cast but this year I think it was all finesse and green. I bought a ton of it last year and got more this year but have only really used the 4 lb. line for crappies and haven't had problems yet. Last year they had hardly any 8 lb. but loads this year. I can't speak on the memory issue. From what a few have said here, it's not that good but for $1.99, it's worth a try."
454213,archer379,2010-04-10 11:02:00,277,i  bought a roll to put on my newbaitcaster so when i am practiceing in the back yard and  get it all messed up i am not wasting a ton of cash lol.
454345,danbouck,2010-04-10 17:58:00,4380,I bought 6 packs of it for backing and for the kiddies rods.
454448,kingofthesteelhead,2010-04-10 23:34:00,140,"bought two spools of 6 lb line and have been using it for panfish for 3 weeks now and no issues. No casting problems ,tangles or anything.Seems like good value for the money!"
