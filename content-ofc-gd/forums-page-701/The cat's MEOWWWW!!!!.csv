453314,Fisherpete,2010-04-08 02:13:00,1814,"Once more, Wednesday afternoon found me prowling the murky waters of the Grand River in Dunnville, hunting for my first giant kitty. This time I came armed with a secret weapon : superguide Steve Piggott and his 20' Lund! We launched around noon, and within minutes of anchoring were onto fish. All I can say is WOW, I have seriously been missing out on catching these things, they are an absolute blast. Big headshakes and strong runs, and the closer they get to the boat, the harder they scrap! I will let the pictures do most of the talking, but here is a quick summary... 5 hours fished, 10 fish landed, most were around 10-12lbs. I had the pleasure of reeling in six, but five were hooked on each rod, so I guess we call it a draw Steve lol... I also had the honour of landing the big cat of the day, 34.5"" and 18lbs! What a tank... and an upgrade for Team One Rippin' Weeds in the catfish category too! (Big cat measured 35"" from the tip of the tail to the tip of the mouth using OFAH rules, and 34"" straight up, so I settled in the middle) Here's the pics... enjoy!                                Anyone who wants to have a great day of fun, and learn how to catch these things on your own - seriously consider giving Steve a call and booking a trip. You won't be dissapointed! He is a member on this site, send him a PM and get out there while the cats are hot! I can't wait to do it again..."
453316,brifishrgy,2010-04-08 02:17:00,559,happy to see you got into em .. not to happy about yours being bigger then mine.. now I am going to have to get an bigger one this weekend
453319,Fisherpete,2010-04-08 02:22:00,1814,I cheated. I used a guide LOL! We'll see how I fare on my own next time out... armed with some new knowledge and a second anchor... my new goal : 20 pounder!
453332,bigugli,2010-04-08 02:31:00,6138,Well done
453334,Sinker,2010-04-08 02:32:00,8692,"Nice work Pete!! If your off every wed, we should hook up. I'm off wed/thurs, and usually looking for someone to play hooky from work to join me! I'd love to get into some of those cats too!!!  S."
453357,solopaddler,2010-04-08 02:50:00,8605,"Well done guys, gotta get over there myself soon."
453417,Stern Rules,2010-04-08 04:23:00,342,Nice cats.   I gotta get down there soon.
453441,Cudz,2010-04-08 05:37:00,2652,Those are really big.  Managed a 27 pounder last year.  It too was big.  They are strong fish indeed.
453454,vinnimon,2010-04-08 06:24:00,2593,"Nice going cheater,LOL.Did you use any of my advice or location.Btw you bumped my fish,LOL.Oh well, More inches for team 1, keep at er folks."
453470,Steve Piggott,2010-04-08 10:54:00,196,"It was a pleasure fishing with you Pete, may head up for those crappy you were taking about.If it was not for the rain it would have been a great day"
453509,brifishrgy,2010-04-08 13:27:00,559,  Its not cheating.. Its a good idea if you want to learn the ropes..  and yes the 2nd anchor is key.. didn't have one last season but got a second one for this year .. makes a world of difference
453510,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 13:29:00,655,"Wow, out with the Grand-master, nice. great day with quality kitties! WTG  I heard Steve is the man on the Grand. Sure kicked our butts last Friday."
453524,fish_fishburn,2010-04-08 14:17:00,1311,"Nice Cats. And the colour, there so green. The cats here out of the Ottawa are way, way, darker almost black. What kind of cats are they?"
453583,brifishrgy,2010-04-08 16:58:00,559," boot mat to keep the carpet clean,  great idea"
453735,CLofchik,2010-04-09 01:47:00,854,"How did that new Frabill hold up? Like the Hideaway, neat no clutter but I wasn't sure how it would hold up with bigger fish."
453738,Fisherpete,2010-04-09 01:59:00,1814,"Steve's boat has the vinyl floor, for easy cleaning anyway, but yep, the boot mat kept all the yummy blood and guts contained quite well.  The Frabill hideaway net is really well designed and built... no problems with any of those big cats."
