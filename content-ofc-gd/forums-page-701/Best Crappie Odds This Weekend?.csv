453539,diggyj,2010-04-08 14:38:00,548,"Where will the best chance to hook into some Crappie this weekend be? Scugog, Rice or in and around Simcoe? I have never fished for them before and only got hooked on them when I went ice fishing for the first time this winter.  I have a boat and can trailer to any of the above lakes. Will the odds be better from shore at some of those ""HOT"" Simcoe spots that everyone knows about?  Thanks.  Dirk"
453568,Ron,2010-04-08 16:12:00,1683,"Where did you find them through the ice this winter Diggyj?  I don't recall seeing a report on them from you.  Cheers, Ron..."
453575,bassman87,2010-04-08 16:31:00,586,heard scugog was doing pretty darn good
453577,Mykester,2010-04-08 16:38:00,241,"From what I've read in another thread, the Kawarthas are on fire."
453611,diggyj,2010-04-08 18:14:00,548, Out in front of Goreskis on Scugog! First time ever on Scugog.  Dirk
453629,fish-miester,2010-04-08 19:35:00,864,"   Key word .. ""was"" its been really swept.. some of the bays they have been catching them have been packed with boats.. not to say that you wont catch them.. just wont be as good as it was a week or so ago."
453657,Big Cliff,2010-04-08 21:25:00,6899," Slipped out for a bit last night on Sturgeon since the rain let up, only caught one in a place we were pounding them last weekend. Guess I'll have to expand my search. Water temps are changing fast with the wind and rain and that could have something to do with it."
453680,highdrifter,2010-04-08 22:38:00,2534,"Rice Lake, right off your dock...  And there's always OOS Bass if you get bored muahahah!!"
453712,kingofthesteelhead,2010-04-09 00:43:00,140,"Scugog,Pigeon,Chemong,just look for shallow bays. Sometimes early am is slow and it picks up as the day goes on. Was on them last weekend both days from late morning until we left.In the Kawarthas.At times it was doubleheaders and fish every cast."
453725,jedimaster,2010-04-09 01:24:00,3472,"Treid chemong, for a bit but it cooled right off only small ones were hitting. Gonna try some of the other lakes this weekend, Scugog or rice may be a better bet."
453736,Stoty,2010-04-09 01:53:00,2910,"Scugog is STILL in fire. We've been out the past two days, and killed them again. We'll be out again tomorrow too!"
453758,GoneFishin,2010-04-09 03:29:00,349,"Any one try fly fishing for them? I did good with a float last weekend then went back with my fly rod and some top water flies. WOW I couldn't keep them off it, don't know if I'll ever float fish for crappie again lol."
453842,Harrison,2010-04-09 14:20:00,2202,"diggyj, I'll be on the lake under your avatar."
453897,fish-miester,2010-04-09 18:09:00,864,  haha Rick me and a few buddies brought out 1 fly rod and figgured we'd try it out.. man we were fighting over it..! so much fun to use
