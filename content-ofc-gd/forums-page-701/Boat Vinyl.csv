453885,radar,2010-04-09 17:08:00,138,Think its about time to re-do the boat flooring. I will be using vinyl. Anyone know of a supplier in and around Markham or Durham? I want to get a few quotes and don't mind travelling.  This board has some awesome posts and content about this topic using search.

453907,Spiel,2010-04-09 18:30:00,9065,Can't say I've ever dealt with them but there's one here in Hamilton and also one in  Barrie and one in Newmarket. Supposed to be discount pricing. Might be worth looking into with a phone call.   http://www.endofther...m/newmarket.php  http://www.endoftheroll.com/barrie.php
453914,solopaddler,2010-04-09 19:00:00,8605,"Ironically enough I'm redoing the deck on my lund today with vinyl.  You can get it from:  Special Touch Marine Upholstery & Canvass  209 Brigade Drive,  Hamilton, ON L9B 2G4   905-385-3409  He doesn't have it in stock but takes about 3 days to get.  Cheers"
453925,Ron,2010-04-09 19:51:00,1683,"I got my exterior vinyl from Home Depot. It's been on for 2 yrs now. A bit thinner but once applied properly, can't tell the difference. There is also a place called DECK TEK in Peterborough, phone number is 1 888 813 7519. We have used this product on many balconies which over lay living space on the condominiums. Extremely durable."

I'm just getting around to doing something about it and thought I see if there was some other choices around here to do some comparrison shopping. I've contacted Boat Tech in Pickering and he says he can order it in too.  Grant Mills Boat Tech 1058 Copperstone Dr, Unit 2 Pickering, ON L1W 3V8 905-686-5008  Found this site through the search feature here that has some really good tips too.  http://bbcboards.zeroforum.com/zeroforum?id=19"
