453499,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 13:08:00,655,"Well, this is something that is long overdue. I have meant to do this for years now, and finally spent the time to sign up on Facebook.  You are all invited to my Facebook.  It will take me a bit to update my profile and figure out how to use Facebook, so if any of you on Facebook have any tips, I would appreciate it.  Hope to see you there.  Aaron"
453516,bigfish1965,2010-04-08 13:57:00,3382,Got a link Aaron? You are too new to show up in search..
453520,Muskieman,2010-04-08 14:12:00,2472,found ya
453525,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 14:18:00,655,"OK, this might sound really dumb, but how do I get a link for my Facebook?  Aaron"
453526,bigfish1965,2010-04-08 14:19:00,3382,just copy and past your URL or ID number
453528,GBW,2010-04-08 14:21:00,8460,copy the URL from the top of your profile page. http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/geoff.warwick
453541,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-08 14:46:00,10439,Welcome to the 21st century Aaron!!!!
453556,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 15:25:00,655,"LMAO I am actually not that bad with technology, although ya wouldn't know it right now LOL. I still can't figure out how to get my Facebook URL from my Blackberry. Maybe I have to be on the regular site, not mobile?  I'll get on at home and update my profile and grab the URL. Will be much easier   Thanks for answering my dumb question!"
453558,GBW,2010-04-08 15:30:00,8460,I'm going to guess this is you Aaron. http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100000951112956&ref=search&sid=539966252.3841836396..1
453560,GBW,2010-04-08 15:37:00,8460,"You might want to creat a group too called ""Getting Hooked with Aaron & Barry"".  I say this because if you look at Dave, he's got so many ""friends"" he's got to do a group page for people to join.  Then you can link it from your web site too.  Cheers. Geoff"
453570,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 16:12:00,655,"Thanks for the tip Geoff!  I'm pretty Facebook ""green"" right now, but I'll figure out how to create a group with that name when I jump on my pc.  I've only been on Facebook on my Blackberry so far.  Thanks again!  Aaron"
453571,GBW,2010-04-08 16:15:00,8460,"Not a problem Aaron.  I'm never on that site anymore, my wife can track me that way, LOL!"
453590,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 17:20:00,655,"Ahh, another good tip.. Don't accept my wife as a friend  LOL  joking!  She knows where I am and what I'm up to all the time anyway"
453616,blaque,2010-04-08 18:45:00,2419," Ahhh, the evil facebook.........might as well sell me your latest boat (cheap) and all your gear. Your freetime has been extinguished LOL.  I dont belong to it, but ive seen what it can do to a normally outgoing and productive person. Was hoping to run into you someday out on the water aaron, but thats going to be highly unlikely now that youve fallen to the facebook."
453824,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-09 13:19:00,655,"Haha Blaque, don't think I'll give up the boat or fishing any time soon  The only reason I am even able to join Facebook now is because I have a Blackberry.  I am rarely at home, and when I am, I rarely have time to hop on-line.  You just might see me on the water yet"
453830,MJL,2010-04-09 13:47:00,2427,"With Facebook, if you want to increase your online 'cool' status, under 'relationships' select 'married to' or 'engaged to' and pick Barry  It'll also make Barry look cool should he have Facebook too  Don't worry, the wife won't care...She'll actually be for it because it's the cool thing to do"
453844,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-09 14:25:00,655,"Haha, very funny MJL, although my 'cool' status might shift to San Francisco LOL  I still haven't had a chance to get on the main Facebook site at home to see all the options. Hopefully by the weekend or early next week, and I can finally update my profile."
453852,blaque,2010-04-09 14:59:00,2419," lol, i hear ya......the only time i get online is at work   Its rare that i get on while im home."
