454183,limeyangler,2010-04-10 03:12:00,5204,"Great read Southpaw, given your location, you are a lost cause if you thik your'e addicted now....lol, Lac Seul is a fish factory !"
454191,Cudz,2010-04-10 03:50:00,2652,As a teacher I resent the fact that you use that quote to describe anything but a teacher.  I thought we had exclusive rights to that one.   PS congrats on our fish.  I hope you have an understanding wife/girlfriend in other words she understands why she won't be seeing quite as much of you as she used to (and that goes for both the wife and the girlfriend lol).
454197,Jonny,2010-04-10 04:29:00,1380," Not to derail the thread but, yeah, it's a well-known quote. Too bad it's so wildly inaccurate."
453979,southpaw24,2010-04-09 22:15:00,32,"Hi everyone... so I had work off today and decided to go fishing. Went to work got a cheap reel (my gf got me a rod for my birthday) got some jig heads and berkley 3"" minnows and went out. After q bunch of snags and a lot of lost line I decided to cast out 2 more times and then walk to the car. Well on my first of my last 2 casts i felt a tug. Now at first I thought I was just snagged again so I didnt really react much to it but then when I saw my line moving in the water I gave a tug back and saw a flash. By this point I was just happy to have something on my line!  So I pulled and reeled in the little critter and this is what I brought in. 15"" of pike!    I know its not the best pic but I was by myself  now I know he's not a monster but for a guy who's definition of fishing was drinking beer and catching minnows in a pond, this was awesome. I am hooked now, pun intended... and cant wait for the summer to get here!   AA"
453983,fishermccann,2010-04-09 22:22:00,655,OOS fish! Try for something else.
453988,Mykester,2010-04-09 22:25:00,241,Nice fish. At this time you should also be targeting bass!
453989,Jer,2010-04-09 22:26:00,1426,"  That really depends on where he was, doesn't it?"
453994,spincast,2010-04-09 22:31:00,3279,welcome to the addiction.
453995,brifishrgy,2010-04-09 22:32:00,559,nice fish ..you don't need expensive stuff to get em.. not gonna jump on ya for an out of season fish because I dont know where you were fishing.. just make sure you got a regs book and read up before you get yourself into trouble
453998,Roy,2010-04-09 22:36:00,13728,Way to go Southpaw. I can feel your pride.
454003,Bigworm,2010-04-09 22:48:00,119,"The pic reads Sioux Lookout, and besides, know one said he kept it. I don't remember the regs saying you can't catch a fish out of season. I'm sure if that were the case, we all would be arrested. Nice fish!"
454006,southpaw24,2010-04-09 22:51:00,32,Hey sorry guys... I am in zone 4 and pike is open year round. And for now I am catch and release... This was the first time I got out for more than half an hour lol... feels good
454008,Bigworm,2010-04-09 22:54:00,119,Exactly! Don't jump on people until you know the facts.
454009,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-09 22:55:00,10439,Pretty amazing this internet thing. Anyone can come on and slag someone for catching a fish without knowing squat other than the species!!!  
454018,The JAY,2010-04-09 23:06:00,239,"Ummm, pike... I'm jealous.... OOS here, but if they're good to go in Zone 4 I may be in for a drive... Where's Zone 4? LOL"
454020,Bigworm,2010-04-09 23:08:00,119,"  Jay,  Go to 17 it's closer."
454024,irishfield,2010-04-09 23:11:00,26272,"1/2 of Ontario is open all year. First time I've seen someone jump on an ""OOS"" Pike picture here. ... it's usually a bass... that's open all year in only a 1/3rd of Ontario."
454031,southpaw24,2010-04-09 23:16:00,32,"Come on guys he didnt know where I was, it's not his fault.  And Jay, your looking at about a 26 hour drive to get to 4.... Sioux Lookout, beautiful country and fish!!"
454038,MillerPhoto,2010-04-09 23:22:00,147,Also Zone 17 - Northern Pike are Open All Year..
454040,Jonny,2010-04-09 23:24:00,1380, You've got lots of bigger 'uns waiting for you!  Pike ... probably my favourite fish for catching.... and eating. You walleye (pickerel) guys move over...
454043,Terry,2010-04-09 23:27:00,14456,"nice going , wish I could get one and I do think a couple of guys should repost and say they are sorry for falsely accusing you"
454046,Sudzy,2010-04-09 23:30:00,88,Great looking fish.  The fish from up north always seem to have stronger coloring than the southern Ontario fish.
454049,spincast,2010-04-09 23:35:00,3279,http://mainehuntingtoday.com/bbb/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/bonw268.jpeg  It isn't always clear what is in season.
454052,Jer,2010-04-09 23:36:00,1426,"Considering the original accuser hails from both Pickering and Cameron Lake, both places that pike are open year round these days (Lake Ontario and zone 17), you would think he would know better."
454055,Jer,2010-04-09 23:38:00,1426,My bad...I guess Lake O is closed right now.
454094,Rich Clemens,2010-04-10 00:31:00,3131,Good deal Southpaw.   Thanks for sharing your excitement with the rest (or most) of us.
454099,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-10 00:41:00,10439, In Spain it's the running of the bulls and in Maine it's the running of the moose!!!!
454103,misfish,2010-04-10 00:46:00,29133,"Drifters on a roll tonight.  Southpaw,forgive the ignoramise.  Welcome and nice catch."
