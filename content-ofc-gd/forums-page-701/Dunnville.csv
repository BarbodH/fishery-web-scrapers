I have a boat but its up in Georgian bay right now so I dont think that im going to bring it to Dunnville. My question is, Is there alot of accesible water from the shore? I have heard that the fishing isn't bad from near Fishmasters. Has anyone fished from shore below the dam and was it successful? Thanks."

There may be two inflatables out so someone can give you a ride a lil bit out. Given that they are inlatables i think you'll have to itch in for paddling lmao !  Oh and ya FM has tonnes of place for you to fish from, and we wanted to fish below the dam but couldnt figure out what technique to use, maybe sliding floats ?  If you are out there tommorow night look for a dude dressed in black with facail fuzz dat'd be me"
