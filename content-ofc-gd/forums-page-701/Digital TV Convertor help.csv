We dont watch a lot of tv nowadays (rather be outside) and I'd rather spend money at the tackle shop then to give away to Bell  anyways, a friend gave me his convertor that he never used (Apex 250 i think)... I hooked up all the connections properly &I ran the auto program scan, but it only gives me one channel (23, from Buffalo)  any suggestions/ideas? greatly appreciated thanks"
454231,Fisherman,2010-04-10 12:15:00,7201,"I think that's because we, north of the border haven't really gone digital yet on over the air broadcasting, still using analog.  If you live in whats referred to as the Lake O bowl, the you will pick up a number of digital stations from south of the border."
454238,Terry,2010-04-10 12:53:00,14456,it is only US stations and many of them are on hold till the economy picks up
454292,Billy Bob,2010-04-10 15:27:00,5865," ALL USA TV stations are now ONLY Digital as it's the law here. However, the digital signal is MUCH weaker then the analog signal so many that enjoyed USA TV stations will no longer receive them. But the signal that you do get is nice and sharp.  One other thing is if you have a VHF and UHF combinder on you over the air antenna then this will decrease your incoming signal...all digital signals are now only UHF. Took me a few months to figure out why 30% of the time I could get signals on certain channels...took off the combinder and now I have a great digital signal.  Bob"
454490,HTHM,2010-04-11 01:35:00,4082,"You also need a digital antenna, availble at Nuetech electronics in Hamilton."
454520,fishdawg,2010-04-11 02:27:00,912," ahhh  that there could be my problem? i have a big 'ol ""annalog"" antenna on the side of my house... i assumed i cold just hook that line up to the convertor & then to my non HD TV & all would be well....  thanks for the responses everyone"
454544,gogu392,2010-04-11 02:58:00,142,"Where are you located? I am located in GTA and with a LCD TV with ATSC tuner built in I am geting 13 HD channels (6 from Canada, 7 form US). I do have a high performamnce antenna. It is a Winegard (US made) omni directional antenna, broad band with amplifier build in. I have it on a pole at roof level. 13 HD channels for free with no monhtly fee. The signal is LEGAL FTA (free to air). and is not compresed as on cable or satelite, that means PRIME QUALITY PICTURE. I like to show the finger up to the big suckers (b e l l and r o g e r s). I will never be their client. More cash for my, less cash for the leaches of this society. The term HD antena is a myth. There si no such concept is jus a markenting brain wash to buy antennas. A god antenna as above mentioned cost $100. The RG6 cable anoter $20. And forget about fatty bills from from leaches. Strong signal to you."
454593,Billy Bob,2010-04-11 11:46:00,5865, I agree......my regular outside antenna that I have had for YEARS works just fine once I took off the UHF/VHF combinder....never even heard of a HD antenna.
454599,Fisherman,2010-04-11 12:10:00,7201," Digital over the air is broadcast on the old UHF band, if you're close enough, you can use a ball of steel wool, bunny ears, UHF antenna.  The signal doesn't care if it's caught by Spidermans web or your wifes spagetti strainer, I'm not being crabby,  honestly, do some research and get wise.  I had words with an employee at an electronics store who was trying to sell a Digital antenna to an older chap for his trailer."
454602,Terry,2010-04-11 12:17:00,14456,some are confusing HDT (High Def) with DT (Digital TV)  they are two different things however HDT is sent digitally
