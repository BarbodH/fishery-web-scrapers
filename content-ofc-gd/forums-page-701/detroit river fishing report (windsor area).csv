454223,wormdunker,2010-04-10 11:37:00,1711,Jay  I was in LaSalle Easter week end.  Had a ball reeling in perch at the Marina behind the TD Canada Trust at the end of Laurier St.  There were lots of boats launching & going to the right (upstream) by the end of the island (I don't know the name).  I heard they were getting walleye.  Just launch & follow the boats.
