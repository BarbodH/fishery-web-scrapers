453566,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-08 15:51:00,2582,Nice!!!  Save some for the 16th though. Looking forward to my first big kittie.
453567,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-08 15:53:00,2690,"Hey, Steve...never tried smoked catfish...what is it comparable too, or is it a totally unique flavour?  Thanks, and, nice fish!!"
453588,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 17:07:00,655,Cool kitties. WTG  Didn't know anyone ate them from the Grand.
453606,John,2010-04-08 18:03:00,2956,"Look great Steve, let's hope the water looks like that next Friday. I remember not being able to hold bottom last year even with 3 anchors out!"
453608,John,2010-04-08 18:04:00,2956," Ya don't eat 'em Aaron, you smoke 'em.........."
453620,CLofchik,2010-04-08 18:57:00,854,"Blackenend Cajun Grand R. kitties, done in a cast iron pan on the grill......  Pan fried works the best for me, my low cholesterol, arteries full of plaque, can't have fat bro-in-law tried grilling them straight on the bbq once and that didn't work out too well.  It takes a bit of practice to get the skinning right, but fish under 10lbs are tasty enough it's worth it.  Have tried smoked yet, mmmmmm"
453659,Big Cliff,2010-04-08 21:31:00,6899,"Steve, save some of that smoked cat fish for me, I'll trade you some jerkey or pepperetts or my daughter or my dog (Ok, Ok, maybe not the dog)for some!  I might even bring some home and try making jerkey from it."
453713,bucktail,2010-04-09 00:43:00,1857,Nice cats as always!! Will the river be fishable this weekend? The creeks are up to there banks here on the north shore?
