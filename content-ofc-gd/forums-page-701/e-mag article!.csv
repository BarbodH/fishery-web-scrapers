453663,Pete Maina,2010-04-08 21:38:00,213,"  Hi, Thanks Tb ... pretty interesting stuff to think about really, and can have some interesting effects. Water that gets blown to one side and stacking in narrow areas - has to return for lake to stay level. Wind has many effects and DIck Pearson is actually the guy that really got everyone thinking about it.  Best,  Pete"
453667,Roy,2010-04-08 21:50:00,13728,"I read that yesterday TB. You're right, a very interesting concept and not something that us mere mortals would have considered.  Something else that always jumps out at me when I read any of Pete Maina's articles is that they're never wordy. The man could say in a couple of paragraphs what many would flower up with filler. His stuff is always interesting and to the point.  Thanks for bringing it up."
