453715,Mykester,2010-04-09 00:53:00,241,"Taking a friend fishing who barely does, going with the good old plentiful bluegill. I'm too lazy to go out and get worms (even though they should be coming out because of the rain) and I'm too lazy to drive to the store, so I'm making doughbait. I need something for scent, mind you, I'm not going to buy things because then I would just buy worms. I have vinegar, coffee powder, honey, pancake syrup, cinnamon, vegeta, horseradish sauce, and a few different kinds of cheese. And I'm pretty low on flour, so this is only a one shot thing."
453718,Syn,2010-04-09 01:09:00,519,Wonder if some tuna or can of mackerel would work mixed in with bread. Something with fish oil.  Also are there any bugs under a rock or worms in your back yard?  Got any berkley gulp juice?
453721,Mykester,2010-04-09 01:14:00,241, Backyard doesn't apply to me as I live in a highrise apartment. I cross through a small park each day when I come home so I might check that out.
453723,Syn,2010-04-09 01:20:00,519, Any frozen breaded fish in your freezer maybe?
453726,bigugli,2010-04-09 01:31:00,6138,juice from  canned of fish.
453727,Mykester,2010-04-09 01:32:00,241," Nope. I have some kielbasa, but then again I don't know if I'd want to waste some good old kielbasa."
453729,Fisherpete,2010-04-09 01:37:00,1814,"Go outside and pick some worms! With today's rain, you can get 100 in 10 minutes or less. I was just out there... they are the best bait for bluegills..."
453734,Syn,2010-04-09 01:45:00,519,"Do you have a cat, maybe some cat food?"
453737,skeeter,2010-04-09 01:55:00,1907,fisherpete is right. the wife and i went out back of our apartment last night and in less then 15 minutes we grabbed over 125 big fat juicey worms. easy pickins.  dann
453739,Mykester,2010-04-09 02:01:00,241," Cat or cat food, eh?  Also I might go lurking for worms tomorrow I guess, there's supposed to be some rain in the evening."
453741,Syn,2010-04-09 02:09:00,519, Check the asphalt bike trails on Scarlett and/or Eglinton for the worms.  Any dead flies on your windows sill from summer? I'd put that on a small hook.
453743,pike n' whities,2010-04-09 02:14:00,131, i heard cats are good for musky.... so maybe it applies to bluegills?  i never really tried making dough. i've used berkley power dough for trout.... was useless. maybe i fished it wrong. who knows. one word... worms..... the fish oil idea sounds like a good one too.
453748,Dozer,2010-04-09 02:43:00,896,"Can of tuna costs .99 cents and you can get tonnes os scent from that... not sure how well it works but it is stinky scent.  I second cat food, observing doughbaits made here at my house, my dad used fish flavoured cat food( dry bits ) which he'd soak over night into a ""mash"" and work it into the dough bait."
