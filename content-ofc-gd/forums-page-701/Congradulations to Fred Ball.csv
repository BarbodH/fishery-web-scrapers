He has been involved with or in charge of the fish-lift at Cobourg Creek for more than 25 years. Fred puts in many hours of work preparing each year for the lift and organizing it. Lifting the rainbow trout is an important environmental function and not an easy piece of work, and Fred has shown tremendous commitment to the cause.  By my guess that is over 5000 rainbows lifted, thousands of volunteers, tens of thousands of extra angler hours trying to catch the lifted fish and countless rainbow fry hatching in quality habitat.  Excellent work Fred, congradulations you are an example for us all."
