434285,Garry2Rs,2010-02-17 19:35:00,1425,"In the past I've stated that I am a long time Shimano fan. Both because of their service and the fact they have a Canadian office, just down the road in Peterborough. However, I do own several Quantum's baitcaster's. With their external controls, beginners seem find them quite easy to use. This morning Cabela's sent out a new e-mail flier. They are advertising a $50.00 savings on the Quantum Catalyst casting reel. (reg.$149.99 for $99.99US.) This is a nice savings, but the purchaser also qualifies for a KVD, Strike King, six lure bonus pack from Quantum. The bonus pack is a $29.95US value for $7.95 in shipping and handling. According to the coupon this offer is valid in both the USA and Canada. If I were buying my first baitcaster, this would be a tempting offer. Garry2Rs"
434301,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-17 20:29:00,3761,Could you see it being a good flip/pitch reel?
434365,backbay,2010-02-18 00:13:00,773,"Garry, that's a well-reputed reel for a good  price. Personally, I've never bought anything in the States and had it shipped here. What are the other costs, duties, and that sort of thing likely to add up to? Thanks, Chris"
434370,Syn,2010-02-18 00:23:00,519,"If they ship by UPS you likely will get murdered by brokerage fee, but if the ship by USPS then Canada Post has a flat fee which is very low. Last time I checked Bass pro USA still uses UPS and the shipping fee was still fairly high.  I wish we could order from Basspro USA for those prices and do free pickup at the VaughnMills Bass Pro."
434437,Garry2Rs,2010-02-18 04:46:00,1425,"Cabela's told me tonight that they charge $14.95 to ship that reel anywhere inside the USA. To ship to Canada they charge $15.95. Mike: The Catalyst reel doesn't have a flippin' switch, but if you want the one with the switch, I have a spare Quantum Accurist that I don't think has ever been used."
434462,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-18 13:00:00,3761,"Quantum Accurist...hmm, what model is it. I'm just looking for a photo/info on it."
434484,Hellfish,2010-02-18 14:52:00,308,"The accurist is a workhorse for bass and pike, the flipping switch is a nice bonus feature."
434490,Syn,2010-02-18 15:15:00,519,Did they mention what shipper? If its USPS then thats a good deal.
434496,JohnF,2010-02-18 15:27:00,3494, That didn't say it included brokerage fees. They're the killer. I've been down that road with scuba gear in the past.  JF
434505,uglyfish,2010-02-18 15:42:00,981,the catalyst would do just fine for flippin and pitchin.
434516,scuro2,2010-02-18 16:59:00,904,Angling outfitters in Woodstock is selling last years model for $70. Bought one. They have a few left.
434518,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-18 17:14:00,2690,Would it have enough guts to handle musky fishing?
434520,Syn,2010-02-18 17:27:00,519,"Personally it would not be my first choice for muskie looks more like a bass reel to me. Anyhow, people catch muskie on their walleye gear all the time.  Here are the specs:link to reel"

434711,jace,2010-02-19 09:55:00,472,"  cabelas uses both courier and USPS so it depends.   send an email to customer service, they'll get back to you in a day."
435541,adempsey,2010-02-22 05:28:00,1498,"I ordered from Cabelas USA about 5 times over the past couple of years.  Brokerage fee was always $3.50.  Shipping varied depending how much I ordered from ~$17 to $19.  Also charged tax.  They lost my order on two different occasions though.  However, they did replace everything free of charge both times without question - and these were 20 to 30 item orders."
