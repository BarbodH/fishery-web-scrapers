434834,Toddyc20,2010-02-19 20:01:00,141,So i just got back from fishing Paudash lake.  We stayed at Anchorage resort and were shown around by our host Brian.  He did a great job of informing us of what the lakers were hitting and how to use the different baits properly.  The fishing was very tough and the bite was extremely light.  If we were not holding our rods we would not even feel the fish hit.  We ended up pulling in 2 lake trout that were in the slot and had to be released.  Probably about 4 or 5 more fish were hooked and missed.  Overall we had a great time and we will probably be calling up Brian again in the future.

435233,mistaredone,2010-02-21 16:00:00,913,I've past that lake a million times heading up to Baptiste. I gotta try it one day.
435285,Toddyc20,2010-02-21 19:08:00,141,Baptiste is a great lake also.  Once a year my fishing buddies and I head to Elephant lake lodge.  Usually once in the weekend we will take a trip over to Baptiste.  So many different kinds of game fish available.
