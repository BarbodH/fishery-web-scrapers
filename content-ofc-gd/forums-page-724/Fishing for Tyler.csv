435163,Woodsman,2010-02-21 03:33:00,1286,Great time today meeting up with some old friends & meeting some new ones. To bad the fish in the deep water didn't co-operate for me.   Lots of lookers but not big on being takers. Only one bite which I lost after a long battle including the fish running off quite a bit of line. Hook broke off the jig. Still have the jig just no hook. On the way in I stopped in 47 fow for 10 mins. to try for perch. That worked out pretty good. Landed 3 fish in 10 mins. including one which got me 3rd place in the perch category. I sure like my new cast iron pot & lid. After the tourny I went back out with the same results in the deeper water. Move back to the same spot for perch and got bites as quick as I could get my maggot tip jig back down until 5:50 pm when the bite just shut down. As I said great day.  Best Wishes: Rick

435206,tonyb,2010-02-21 13:59:00,1637,"I'm glad to be a part of another successful Tyler fundraiser and fishing day in 2010.  There was a really great turnout yesterday, maybe the biggest ever, and as a result there were a lot of fish brought in which was nice to see.  You could tell by all the smiles and the sound of laughter that everyone had a good time.  Congrats to the big Laker caught by Doug, I think, and also to the guy who caught that massive Whitefish, some real impressive fish guys!!  I didn't see the winning Perch but I think it was around 11 or 12""..not too shabby either.  Hopefully Tyler continues to inspire those around him and improve with the love and support of his family and 'community'  Until next year, good fishing.  Tony"
