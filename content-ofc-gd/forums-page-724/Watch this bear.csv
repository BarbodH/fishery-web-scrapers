434401,solopaddler,2010-02-18 02:08:00,8605,"Cool. I've seen that in the wild more than once myself. I've also been driving south down 11, mid-day, and saw what I thought was a hitchiker. Turned out to be a bear standing erect on the shoulder with one ""arm"" outstretched.  I was so startled I almost stopped and picked him up."

434414,HTHM,2010-02-18 02:30:00,4082,I am surprised I did not hear the videographer slapping the misquiters.  That is amazing footage.

435542,Dozer,2010-02-22 05:29:00,896,Awesome video! Nice to know male bears don't discriminate against the disabled bear population.
435641,fisherman7,2010-02-22 17:16:00,325,That's just freaky! I think if I saw that walking in the bush I'd swear it was bigfoot!
435663,ehg,2010-02-22 18:46:00,2666, Ya this is so obviously fake. The bear just gets up and strolls quickly around
