435077,bowshep,2010-02-21 00:06:00,378,"Oh Waaaaaaaa. l wish l had your knowledge. l wish l could bring in more fish than l do. l have been made a joke at OFC as the drama king and do l quit. l have gone trout fishing 30 times in a row with out catching a fish do l quit.  l am not a person to say nice fish,nice baby, nice truck, or l am so happy/sad for you. As a fisher man do you quit? DMass is a great person and is an avid and dedicated person when it comes to fishing and will help anyone even my useless fishing talent. Almost every time he posts someone has to crap on it. He is still here and still my friend and still helps me with the trout.  You want to quit then that's your choice but don't leave because you have not received the acknowledgment in which you think you deserve. Vanity is destructive.  Ken  Ps. l even wish l could write posts as good as you."

Cheers! Kerry"
435154,douG,2010-02-21 02:46:00,2693,"2Rs took me fishing on his home lake near Apsley the same day that the power went out all over the NE, 2nd week of August it was. 2003.  But anyway, it was Garry who took me muskie fishing for the first time, and gave me my first lesson with a baitcaster.  On that same afternoon, I succeeded in pulling a bait away from a really nice muskie.  My first.  Garry was also famous for the best photography on OFC back in the early days - some of his captures still ring the bell.  He is a wise and gentle man, a nice guy I guess you would say.  Garry, these are all things you know.  I don't expect a comment from you on my posts, even if I actually went fishing and caught something, a very rare event.  I enjoy your reports and seeing your scruffy mug  again, if only to learn how to take pictures.  I think your posts stand on their own merit, replies or no.  Best to you, 2Rs."

Figure that sometimes people just want to look but have nothing to say but still enjoyed the story or the pictures however yes responses due make a difference because if no comments are made then a person can say why bother?  Hope you have a change of heart and stay around, I do enjoy your posts and can still remember your escapades about the accident on your way south.

435213,ChrisK,2010-02-21 14:45:00,2772,"Garry, I only got one thing to say bud......dacron sucks Almost ten years after we haggled over this topic for the first time ever I still use mono(after experimenting) for all my applications,bass,walleye even pike and muskie oh ya,even steelhead  ....If I can land a ten pound steelhead on 3 pound mono what does that tell ya ??? I guess its mostly personal preference for me. Don't get me wrong,after arguing with you on numerous occasions I did try to cross over to the dark side spending oodles of cash on dacron to test it out and see if there was any merit to your argument only to end up with a lot of abrasive twine to tie up my tomato plants with and even then the stuff kept on reeking havoc buy cutting into the plants instead of into my guides and flesh. Now common and lets move forward,keep your posts coming.We read them and obviously they satisfy our expectations or you would be getting negative response and eventually ending up with little locks beside your threads which I have never seen or done yet so your doing something right. Your a good man Garry and we have come along way so hold it together bud and carry on....."

It's worth noting that just because you don't get a response it does not mean what you posted was not appreciated. If nobody was reading your threads It would be a different story. I think you'll find that some of most worthless threads are actually the longest. Maybe see you around if I ever get a boat that works. Cheers, Ross"

434962,Garry2Rs,2010-02-20 10:55:00,1425,"Although no one could ever accuse me of being mute, this is will be my Swansong. My last few fishing/tackle posts have had over 150 hits each, but no reply's Perhaps instead of a fishing reports or product reviews I should have asked a question... Something mundane, like ""What's the best line""... or ...""What's length rod should I use?"" Maybe a wild opinion like ""I think my CTC rods are just as good as G.Loomis anyday!!!"" would have stimulated the masses.  I have decided that this will be my last post to OFC and so in an attempt to leave you with something of value, I will offer you one final input, that I hope will be of interest.  In my constant search and research of fishing topics, I found a man in Wichita Kansas who does reels repairs, cleaning and tuning.  The comments I saw on US boards were all quite positive, so I contacted him and ultimately sent him six bait caster's to tune for me.  What can I tell you?  After he worked on my Calcutta's, Chronarch's, and Ardent 1000's, which are among the best reels on the market, they are even better than new.  His prices are low, less than $20 per reel, and his work is outstanding.  Why should you care? Well the simple facts are these: The main difference between a $180 reel like a Curado and a $300 model like a Chronarch is in the smoothness attained by the polishing of the working surfaces.  This is hand work, so you will pay dearly for it.  As part of his Pro-tune, Kevin smooths all of these working surfaces.  The net result is that you gain yards on your casts and your anti-backlash controls work better than ever before.  Check out: www.proreelservice.com Good Luck and Goodbye.

I can only suggest that you leave nothing to question - your reports are fully detailed and leave nothing to wonder about.  I suggest this to be the reason for little or no response, coupled with jealousy over your location right now (I know I am!).  I hope you reconsider, I promise I will respond, I just haven't felt I've been here long enough to interact as much as others.  I sure would miss your reports, I got a real kick out of how short your ""winter"" was there.  Michael"

You must realise that there are alot of younger guys on these forums, or people that are new to a form of fishing that ask some of those questions legitimately.  I know when I asked about musky rods, I got alot of responses, including many offers for used rods...one of which I purchased, another that I still might. Granted there are many topics that just make me shake my head...ignore them and move on. Great info on the reels.  Good luck and good fishing!!"

If it ain't about the Olympics or ice fishing it's getting little to no action, and icefishing isn't even getting that much of late. You've been spending too much time chasing Yuma bass in the warm sun and have forgotten how the cold and snow stifles our curiosity up here. When we're all wetting lines regularly we hang off your every thread, and for good reason. But this late in the winter doldrums we're all suffering brain freeze and can barely muster the enthusiasm to argue about hockey let alone summer fishing.  If it weren't for guys like you how would us newbies learn to do it right in the nice weather? C'mon ya grumpy old fart. Cut us some slack here.

435003,Radnine,2010-02-20 15:56:00,1538,"Garry, I should probably send this to you in the form of a PM, but since you opened this can of worms I will weigh in. I consider you a very knowledgeable angler that is clearly dedicated to the sport (so much so that you can apparently derive some income from it). And that could be a part of the lack of response problem. When you speak it tends to be a thread ender (check it out, you have ended more threads than the mods!). What I mean by that is when you weigh in with a ""I'm Garry two R's and that's the way I see it"" post, what are us mere armatures supposed to say? Perhaps at the end of the day this forum isn't ""all business"" enough for you. Personally, the fact that someone can post a kick-ass fishing report then follow it up with a ""what kind of tires should I buy?"" post is what is awesome about this place. And maybe it is just me but, I also think that people are becoming slightly more aware of guides making posts that don't say much other than ""if you want to actually know anything, hire me"", and respond accordingly.
