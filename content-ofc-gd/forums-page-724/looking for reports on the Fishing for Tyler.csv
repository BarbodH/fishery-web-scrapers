435064,Fisherman,2010-02-20 23:03:00,7201,"I'm sure they're coming, I was out with 12footspringbok, saw BigChevy4x4 and Lady Walleye, TJ and Avery were wandering around the bay having a chat with everyone, stiff leg Terry was hobbling around with a cane, DMasse and his entourage was whaling up the perch.  First went to a big laker around 30"" from there the whities took over.  A great day, good burgers and dogs.  Hope this happens again next year."

I go to get back in the truck and it's 3pm, lol.   I went by the park but everything was being packed up so I headed home.  Sorry I missed everyone!"
