It's not going to swim and move like a real minnow, but I wonder if the scent alone is enough to entice some bites on a set line like this.  Anyone try it?"

I think next time I go into the park I'm gonna bring a pack of 3"" Shad and try them against my buddy running real (dead) minnows!! In the park you cant use alive bait anyways so if these actually work it'd be nice to just use the GULP and not worry about stopping at the bait shop, making sure they're dead, dealing with the MNR etc etc..."
435063,Muskieman,2010-02-20 23:00:00,2472,I've tried it.... On a dead line and .... NOTHING!!! I've tried it on a Jiggin' rod and SUCCESS!!!  Gotta keep her movin'  RFS
