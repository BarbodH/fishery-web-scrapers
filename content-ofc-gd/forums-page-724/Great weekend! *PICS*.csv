These two ladies had never tried ice fishing and wanted to give it a shot.  We targetted perch for their first time.  We started in 46 ft and marked a ton of fish, but very finicky.  Moved to 57 and found some more aggressive fish.  They iced about 50 fish in the 4 hours and brought home about 25 for the pan.  Not a phenominal bite by any means but steady and enough to keep them happy, thats what matters.  Most fish taken on nymphs and a new ""bug"" I've been working on.  Met my second group at 1pm and headed out to the laker grounds.  Set up shop in 94 feet of water and never moved.  Steady marking the whole trip until 5pm, with some very aggressive pods moving through.  Will and Decker managed to go 6 for 10 including 2 double headers.  2 fish caught on a tube, 4 on the zonker.     Sunday Well I met up with Brad and Amy for a half day on Simcoe today.  Had a productive day yesterday so decided to try the same spot.  Slow start then the whities started moving in steady.  The fish werent very aggressive in general, but the odd fish would SMASH the zonker jig.  The two guys limited out and I brought one home for myself, cant wait to get it on the smoker.  "
