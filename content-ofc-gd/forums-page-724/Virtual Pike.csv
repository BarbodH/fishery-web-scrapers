434822,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-19 18:29:00,3761," lol, it's the same obviously"
434833,dave524,2010-02-19 19:44:00,4508," Yeah, I saw that it was tied to google by the logo, but, the last time I was on google it did not have street level for anywhere between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. Just tried google again and see my house there. Google has expanded their coverage recently, my mistake, thought the new site had better coverage."
434835,EC1,2010-02-19 20:19:00,930,"wow, mighty good stuff! Thanks for sharing it!"

434848,archer379,2010-02-19 20:51:00,277,last sumer while working the google maps car drove by. We were talking about it the other day so i thought i would check it out and sure enough  you can go that adress aqnd see us working. funny thing is that we were working at a corner and the first time the car went by we are working the second time we are on break
434849,Roy,2010-02-19 20:56:00,13728,"Hard to believe that not more people know about this. My house pic was taken June 4th '09. I can tell by which vehicles are in the driveway, the progress of the hanging baskets and flowers and the recycling bin out on the curb."

435038,Twocoda,2010-02-20 19:41:00,4130,How true Clofchik.....how true....i guess my street isnt important enough to be worth the bother of filming ...
435209,Governator,2010-02-21 14:11:00,879,Google expanded nearly everywhere and that vpike site went viral as if they magically created it.  Tis a shame.
