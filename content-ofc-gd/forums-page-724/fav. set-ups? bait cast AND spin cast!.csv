434859,Toddyc20,2010-02-19 21:43:00,141,Mine is a 7' MH Basspro Rick Clunn crankbait baitcasting rod and Quantum energy burner reel.  I use it for my spinnnerbaits and it works very well.
434865,BillM,2010-02-19 21:52:00,17367,Most likely my 7ft St.Criox Avid + Shimano Calais 200 baitcast setup running 20lb Suffix braid.  Then there is all the float gear..  Hard to pick!!!

434957,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-20 07:29:00,158,"10+ year old curado (what a champ of a reel) and a newer 7' fenwick. 6' light berkley series one with  shimano sendona 1500, i swear i can feel walleye fart near the jig in 30 fow with this thing. 7'6"" Okuma Heavy EVx  Musky Rod and shiamno calcutta 400TE.    Its a bit light for a lot of stuff i throw, but man it is a treat to fight big pike and muskie on, the drag is so silky smooth, best reel i have ever owned of any style/type ever...."
435130,brickNblock,2010-02-21 01:44:00,598,"..I'll have to agree with the Calcutta...Got the 401TE myself(Lefty).,amongst many others for 'llunge fishing and still enjoy every moment it is in my hand and yes, the drag is silky smooth...also have the 301.  Like Weeds however, I made a trip to the past and invested in some spinning gear last season...I too forgot all about the finnese of this type of gear...Picked up the Shimano Stradic 3000 coupled with Shimano Crucial'7'MHFast, in August picked up another identical for jigging walleye out on the BOQ....love it...every combo tho has their own unique uses as they should but then SOME...you just dont want to put down."
434145,redneck666,2010-02-17 03:40:00,563,"so, whats your fav. set ups people? i myself love my cheapie deals.... $60-$120... great rods and reels that have caught alot of fish!  im sure some people enjoy posting about it....?  keep 'er short! im too lazy to read long paragrahps  maybe a small explination with the set up? lol  JP"
434410,bucktail,2010-02-18 02:15:00,1857,"My favorite now is a Loomis Crankbait series MH with a 200 Curado and30 pound power pro. Braid gives me that feel and the extra fast tip on the Loomis slows my hooksets long enough to let the fish get it better, also the extra fast tip absorbs the shock so you dont pull the bait out. If anyone has the money I urge them to get this outfit, it really will ioncrease your crankbait scores."

This season I plan to add to it Croix Legend Tournament Walleye's in 7' Medium Moderate and 6'8"" Medium Extra Fast with either Shimano Stradic Ci4's or Daiwa Fuego's.  These 3 rods should cover all my Walleye spinning rod needs, I'll have to add a couple baitcasters/trolling rods for heavy bottom bouncers and planer board use as money permits   ."

434529,archie_james_c,2010-02-18 17:51:00,618,"Is it just me or G Loomis' website rediculously hard to navigate? I am interested in their rod's, but everytime I go to research them I am frustrated with their site. They classify the rods by a serial number, and if you don't already know the meaning of it forces you to click on each single model to find out the action and power of the rod. Very frustrating if you ask me.  Croix I think outdid themselves on ease of use as far as their website goes. Click on a particular series and a chart with every length, power and action comes up, and below the chart a brief description of the rods intended use."
434533,uglyfish,2010-02-18 18:36:00,981,"  yes, but they have an explanation someplace on the site of what it all means. when most companies just rate a rod medium, med/hvy... moderate, fast, xtra fast etc. loomis uses a number system.  if u cant find it on the site, PM JP derose and ask him. he will tell ya exactly what u need to know if ya tell him what ur looking for."

Balance is right on, the extra fast tip makes it easy to drive those hooks home and it has just enough give to feel that jerk bait twitch when you load the rod..   The extra length is great for working big pike off the harbour walls too!!  HD"

I've played around with it in the backyard and it feels pretty solid as a good Spinnerbait/buzzbait rod.  This and within a few weeks  I'll be buying myself a Revo SX and a new Abu Vendetta 7'6H Flippin Stick for pitching jigs. Going to be a sweet rod/reel

Was an awesome combo, caught a pile of assorted fish with it last year tossing senkos, small spinners and float fishing. I'd gotten way to into using baitcasters over the last couple of years and this combo brought me back to my senses; made me realize the practicality and enjoyment of using more of a finesse approach/tackle."
434851,Jigger,2010-02-19 21:12:00,1237, You tried that setup yet? Seems to me that you'd want to avoid the PP. I've seen your hooksets dood.
