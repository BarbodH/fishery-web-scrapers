434759,10point,2010-02-19 14:02:00,165,"Some of you may remember me being on here some last summer. I live in Indiana and my wife is from London. I am thinking about taking a trip possibly in June. The plan would be to drop my wife off in London and head North no more than say 7 hours. We would have a boat and would be looking for Walleye, Northern, or Bass. Any suggestions? We would probably be looking at 3-4 days of fishing.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
434761,bigbuck,2010-02-19 14:18:00,2449,"You could look at some outfitters North of Sault Ste Marie but it'll be about 9-10 hours from London. The French River would be a good bet at about 5-6 hours or so. There's walleye, bass, pike, muskie, and smaller fish in there. I'm not sure if bass and muskie will be open whenever you come up in June but walleye and pike will be."
434763,10point,2010-02-19 14:31:00,165,Would the French River be wade fishing or could we use a boat?
434766,timmeh,2010-02-19 14:46:00,609,You will need a boat to fish the French river. Bass doesn't open until the last Saturday in June so if you're interested in them you'll need to hold off your trip until July.
434767,bow slayer,2010-02-19 14:47:00,1074,"I would go to the west side of Nipissing/French River area. Great fishing walleye,pike,bass,musky ,tons of resorts to choose from and amazing scenery.   Here check this link    http://www.lakair.com/"
434769,Governator,2010-02-19 15:12:00,879,Are you planning to camp or rent a place?
434770,10point,2010-02-19 15:27:00,165, We would rent a place.
434780,Moosebunk,2010-02-19 16:05:00,3970,"Bruce has some cozy little cabins at a good price at... www.tamarvacations.com  About 6-7 hours from London.  BIG structured lake with good walleye and bass fishing.  Pike and lakers also available.  Docking for your boat at the island, parking for your vehicle at the access road.  Lake maps available online or at the tackle shop on route."
434847,bigbuck,2010-02-19 20:50:00,2449,"The French River is more like a lake than a river, it is over 60 miles long. You need a boat most definitely."
434989,Billy Bob,2010-02-20 14:26:00,5865,"I guess we should know how big is your boat.....Nippissing is very large and can get rough, but there are MANY MANY other lakes of all sizes to choose from."
435028,NBR,2010-02-20 17:49:00,163, I have been to Tamar and thinks it is a great place. The bass season opens June 26 this year. Bruce is a great guy and the smally fishing is very good. Without working to hard 50+ fish days are pretty common. Northerns aren't as plentiful as other lakes I've fished but size is great. They really fatten up on those lake trout.  Tamar is a boat in place which I highly reccommend. If you want more info shoot me a PM. I'd be happy to give you some guidance as to the maps to buy and where/how to fish.  Where are you from in Indiana? I was born there and spent most of my working life calling on the automative parts makers in Indiana and southwest Michigan.

435078,Billy Bob,2010-02-21 00:08:00,5865,"Another great question is, do you have GPS mapping with Sonar.....like a Lowrance LMS 520 or similar...if so it really makes a difference when navigating unfamiliar waters....the French River really has no mapping for it's waters and that is really one area that should have since it's so large and complex.....but if  you do have a Sonar/GPS  unit you can get excellent mapping for the Kawarthan Lakes.....Stoney Lake is one of my favorites along with Upper/Lower Buckhorn and Pigeon Lake. There are many guys here that fish these lake regularly and some even live on these lakes that will chime in if  your interested enough in one of them....for me the Kawarthan Lakes are the hidden jewel in Ontario...not to far 3-4 hours from the Peace Bridge and everything to offer you can think of.  Good Luck, Bob"
435210,greyhawk,2010-02-21 14:28:00,33,"Highly recommend Memquisit Lodge on the West Arm of L. Nipissing. Wonderful cabins and a great meal plan, if you are interested. They also offer a good boat/motor/meal package."
435270,Mark Kulik,2010-02-21 17:52:00,348,"Try Olive the lake the Lake lodge near Marten River, its a small lake, really easy to figuire out, never gets rough, and has Walleye, Pike and tons of smallmouth bass, meals are awesome, and they have the only lake access. they have a facebook page and a website."
435295,Tomcat,2010-02-21 20:13:00,395,"I'd recommend looking into the Abitibi-Témiscaming area of north western Quebec (about 65 miles north east of North Bay, Ontario). London to Témiscaming is 353 miles (just about 7 hours driving according to Mapquest) and a lot of it on 4 lane highway (e.g. 401, 400, 11). Quebec walleye possession limits are 6 or 8 depending on location and there are no size restrictions other than a minimum size limit. The Shield Lakes in north western Quebec are deep, well structured and provide access to lake trout and northern pike fishing as well. A non-resident fishing licence for 3 days is $27 CDN. If you have any interest in trying a fishing trip to north western Quebec, let me know and I'll send you a PM with some recommended locations and outfitters."
