Just wondering if anyone has been to this lake or surrounding area?  If so, I would appreciate any hints or tips you have for the area. Thanks."

The area I'm in is approx. 40 km from Lawton lake, so you'll be roughly in the same area. What you'll probably find is some stands set up around your area looking over a lake or swamp. You shouls avoid running around in the bush. There is no need for that. The moose are there, it's just a matter of enticing them out. You will need to know how to call them in. You won't have worry about that if you have a guide. They'll take care of that."
