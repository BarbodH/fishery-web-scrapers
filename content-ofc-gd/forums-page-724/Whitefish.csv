435093,phiphntek,2010-02-21 00:52:00,115,they are excellent brined then cold smoked
435131,xeon,2010-02-21 01:44:00,350,"Filleting is easy, start the cut behind the head, run the knife along the spine to the tail, cut out ribs, make two small slits to take out the pin bones, remove skin, done.  Cook it just like any other fish."
435141,vinnimon,2010-02-21 02:04:00,2593,"Thanks,I was a little concerned about the bones.I heard they were boney.I may also cut them up into steaks and add some dill and lemons  yet.Or even just some lemon pepper and salt  .Im more of pickerel and trout guy for eats.Maybe I can dice it up and cook it slowly in a cream of brocoli or cauliflour soup,as I did once for pickerel while camping."
435144,Sinker,2010-02-21 02:12:00,8692,"Just cook it like you would your walleye then. I fillet them, and fry them just like any other fish. They're good deep fried in beer batter too. Actually, they're good any way you can get them!! LOL.  Try and remove as much fat, and mudline as you can. It makes a big difference.  Cut thru the pin bones when you fillet them, then remove them after you skin it.  S."
