The Exit from the 400 is Inisfil Beach Road. Take it all the way east to the lake.  There is a Tim Hortons/ gas station right off the hwy.  There are a number of gas stations as well as coffee shops right down by the lake access, including another timmies and a few mom and pops. Sorry no starbucks for those of you from the big smoke (bring your own).  There are some places for bait, but the word is minnows are hard to come by, or non existent.  12- 15 inches of solid ice. Lots of cars and trucks on the lake, some snow and some bare spots. Use your own judgment if you are thinking of taking your vehicle out on the lake.  Anybody else have something of value to add?  Tight lines. "

Area is towards Snake/Fox Is.  If you don't know the area, ask."
