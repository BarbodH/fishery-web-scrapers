These people were truly salt of the earth awesome hosts...The bite started from the minute the first minnow hit the water and was off and on all weekend...We brought home about 50 jumbos between the 4 of us but threw back well over another 100...The walleye bite was pretty cold for us we ended up with 3 none  over 13"" and all went back (figured we'll get those ones next year)...we did see a few caught over 24 which if I was being honest made me completely jealous yet incredibly excited at the same time...Oh yeah even put a mud puppy on the ice LOL...all in all a great first ice outing for all of us have a bunch of pics but literally just walked through the door and am far to lazy to tackle that right now...I thank you all for putting me on to Idle Tymes and will from now on be a repeat offender there!!!   For the boys on team 7 I don't know if quantity over quality counts in the tourney but nothing for nothing it was a fantastic Tyme truly nothing Idle about it!!!!"
