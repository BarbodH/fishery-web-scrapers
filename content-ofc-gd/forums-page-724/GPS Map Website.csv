435061,danbouck,2010-02-20 22:47:00,4380,just came across this website http://www.magicmaps.ca while deciding whether or not to drop the money on a map for my new GPS. I have downloaded some and loaded them onto my new GPS and they work great.  Best part is they are FREE
435072,uglyfish,2010-02-20 23:40:00,981,only works for magellan GPS units though according to the site...  not much use for us lowrance guys
435108,IndySKS,2010-02-21 01:11:00,134,"uglyfish I believe there is a program out there that you can use to convert those Magellan to Garmin or whatever, I thought I had it but i cant find it right now."
435112,danbouck,2010-02-21 01:19:00,4380, there has got to be some sites around for lowrance. This one saved me $100. Not bad considering I saved almost $200 on the GPS itself.
435132,Syn,2010-02-21 01:45:00,519,"Theres always http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/ for ""older"" garmin. Might work for lowrance too, not sure."
435134,BUSTER,2010-02-21 01:50:00,1336,"Thanks to Dan, I picked up one myself today..But I havent had much luck with that zip file map, might get you to call me dan and walk my incompetent azz thru it........"
435135,Syn,2010-02-21 01:53:00,519,  zip file? Did you look inside the zip? Maybe you have to extract it.
435145,vinnimon,2010-02-21 02:15:00,2593,Does anyone know if a magellan sport tac color is considered as a crossover series?
435192,IndySKS,2010-02-21 11:54:00,134,Try using GPS Babel. You get get a free download (use Google) or use GPSvisualizer.com.  it converts the files from one brand to another.
