631408,Jewelbee,2011-10-16 17:13:00,422,There is a product called Mellisa's Pet. It is Aloe Vera based and I have heard good reports about it. I think you could find it by Google. Might be worth a try. Good Luck! Found a link for ya http://www.dogsincanada.com/melissas-aloe-pet
631409,skeeter99,2011-10-16 17:18:00,109,you can try stridex or gentamycin pads/ointment  in these dogs alot of the time it is cause by diet (ie. poor food) try the food avoderm it will help alot with the skin issues. also the bowl he eats from should be a flat bottom with straight sides to prevent as little of the skin touching the food/bowl which also helps and you yourself should be vigilante and wiping him down with baby wipes/soapy towel to keep clean

631432,ChrisK,2011-10-16 19:17:00,2772,Here's something interesting and worth while looking into. My Arnie had some skin issues as well and the vet told us to use human Nyzerol shampoo to help him get rid of this yeast issue on his skin. A lot of it may be food related too like mentioned above and in this link.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100416113601AAZUU
