631255,OutdoorDan,2011-10-15 23:43:00,325,"Hi all,  I recently got a Ci 4 2500 and wanted a spare spool for it.  I find it ridiculous that the reel doesn't come with a spare spool in the first place, but what can you do...  Anyone had any luck getting spare spools?  I checked ebay but the only available options were from Japan or USA which converts to 35$ shipping.  Is is possible to get the directly from Shimano?  Thanks!"

631464,esoxansteel,2011-10-16 21:31:00,1307,"I have been told the C4s spools have been back-ordered for ever, as there are many looking for them as well"
631466,scugpg,2011-10-16 21:35:00,1373,They are also sixty dollars a spool from what I've been told. The mgfb spool will work and much cheaper
631469,Terry,2011-10-16 22:16:00,14456,If it's just as a back up the regular stradic spool works fine on it so I was told I am going to buy one for mine  
631490,esoxansteel,2011-10-17 00:02:00,1307,"  Think thats expensive, a Stella spool is double that then add 30 more bucks, theirs gold in them their spools"
631707,adolson,2011-10-17 18:55:00,783,"Yup, call them direct: 866-491-5229  I just ordered a spool from them for my Spirex. Came out to $28 or so with the $3 shipping charge, should arrive in a week to ten days."
631710,OutdoorDan,2011-10-17 19:11:00,325,"Thanks, Dana!  As for the spare spools being expensive, yes, but it's still better than buying a new reel and I'm too used to having a spool of mono and braid for the same reel."
