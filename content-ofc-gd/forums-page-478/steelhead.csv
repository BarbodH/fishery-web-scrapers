630938,northernpike56,2011-10-14 21:12:00,717,"It's been raining around here for the last few days and from what I've read, that is good for steelheading. I have some pink berkley worms as well as some marabou jigs in black and white and a few #2 and #3 mepps spinners.  At this time of year, would the steelhead be in the tribs or still staging at the piers?  Also, I drove over a river beside my house and it looked like chocolate milk. Would this affect the fishing because the steelhead would not be able to see? Should I be waiting a few days for the water to clear up a little bit so the steelhead can see my lures but can not see me?"

630944,esoxansteel,2011-10-14 21:25:00,1307,"Knowing which rivers clean the quickest will be your ace in the whole, as the eastern tribs are dirty, but the rivers will no doubt hold fish and when visibility increases will be your best chance  "

630947,misfish,2011-10-14 21:31:00,29133," But,with rain the last two days and more tonight,I would think give it a day or two.  Yes DAVEY"
630998,Pangle,2011-10-14 23:51:00,64,"I was out today and surprisingly the water had about 2-3 ft visibility.  I went 6 for 7 (all bows) with 3 over 18"".  The fish seemed to turn on during the down pours. My phone camera will not allow me to upload the pics.....so no fish porn.....sorry."
631001,misfish,2011-10-14 23:59:00,29133," Ya, those south of 89 have that problem."
631013,BillM,2011-10-15 00:29:00,17367,"Only rivers that aren't going to be blown are those high gradient freestone rivers.  Not many of those around..  I am fishing this weekend, but not anywhere close to here, lol."
631015,GoneFishin,2011-10-15 00:42:00,349, I wouldn't be to quick to grab the gun in the morning  I'm just sayin
631026,misfish,2011-10-15 01:15:00,29133,"  I like my meat dark.LOL  Good luck Bill. I,ll give it a go Sunday."
631219,northernpike56,2011-10-15 21:09:00,717,Great! So I'm assuming that the rainbows and browns would be in the rivers now? will they stay in there all winter? It rained again today so I think ill give it about 3 days before I try
631223,BillM,2011-10-15 21:15:00,17367,"Browns are fall spawners, steelhead are spring spawners (For the most part)  Browns usually spawn, then head back out to the lake.  Steelhead will winter in the river, spawn in the spring then head back to the lake."
631250,misfish,2011-10-15 23:13:00,29133,"I made the right call. River was way up(from what I could see,6 inch vis) and the ducks were flying upside down with the high winds this morning."
631259,SirCranksalot,2011-10-15 23:51:00,3291," Are you talking about the Notty? It looked pretty good today in W. Beach. At  least a few fish being, but not by me :-(.   "
631261,misfish,2011-10-15 23:54:00,29133,"AH, NO Nice of you to say,"
631264,SirCranksalot,2011-10-16 00:10:00,3291, I don't really understand that response. Are you saying that I revealed too much  info on this forum?
631267,misfish,2011-10-16 00:23:00,29133,"removed my post, as not to derail northernpike56 question.    feel free to pm me .PLEASE."
631282,buckster,2011-10-16 01:08:00,530, YES!
631418,northernpike56,2011-10-16 18:01:00,717,Thanks for the info! maybe I'll try the pier soon
631424,Pangle,2011-10-16 18:25:00,64,"Northerpike65, its best to take a look for your self each time it rains.  This way you can judge how the rain will affect your local trib/river.  Over time you will develop a ""feel"" of the rivers and decide which will be fishable.  You will usually be able to predict when to go, but sometimes you will run into chocolate milk......lol. For example, I was out driving today and noticed 3 tribs to be very fishable and 1 questionable.  Anyway good luck."
631498,northernpike56,2011-10-17 00:40:00,717,  Thanks!
