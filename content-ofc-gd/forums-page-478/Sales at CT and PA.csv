630749,scugpg,2011-10-14 13:18:00,1373,I see that Princess auto is carrying the ctek chargers now at a special price next week. Also looks like Canadian tire has a good sale on their tie down and ratchet straps for those interested.
630975,spoon,2011-10-14 22:42:00,74,"I bought one while the last sale was going on, I used it as per instructions to charge my Optima. Showed fully charged, but when I used it the next day the battery lasted for an hour max and then it just died. Battery doesn't hold voltage anymore. Battery always worked perfectly, before I used this charger, Optima was basically brand new.  Just wanted to share that with the fellow OFC'rs"
630984,Terry,2011-10-14 23:05:00,14456,"I don't consider them a real charger, but I know a bunch of guys here swear by them  for me 10 amps is a charger if the battery was down 100 amps it would take 10 hours to get it up 100% ......a 5 amp charger would take 20 hour that 3.3 would at 30 hours to get it up if I get home at 5pm from fishingand am leaving to go fishing at 5am that only give me 12 hours to get the job done"

631168,Dabluz,2011-10-15 17:27:00,701,"  You have to be really careful about which charger to buy these days.  Many do not recharge deep cycle batteries.  I ruined a battery last year because I could not fully charge my deep cycle battery with a battery charger that I bought at C.T.  I now have a Schumacher battery charger that I bought at Walmart and it works perfectly.  I got it too late to recharge the battery that wouldn't recharge last year.  Yes, it does fully charge now but the battery's capacity is greatly reduced."
