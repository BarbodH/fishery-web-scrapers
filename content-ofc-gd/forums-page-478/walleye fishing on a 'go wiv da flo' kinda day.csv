630710,limeyangler,2011-10-14 04:08:00,5204,"Hi all,  Plan was to go to Lac Seul this morning. Had everything ready to go and was up at 6:30 am. Rain was bucketing down outside and I think the noise on the roof woke baby Jack. He came out to the couch and we snuggled up...before I knew it and 3 episodes of toopy and binoo later it was almost 9 o'clock!  I made Jack some fruit salad and we all had pancakes too, by now I did not want to go up to Lac Seul, just a good family morning.  About midway through shopping in town....the urge to fish was again upon me. I planned to just put the boat in locally somewhere after lunch. I lay down with Jack to give him his nap time milk...fatal...I woke up 2 hours later next to a snoring baby and sleeping mum.  I eventually headed out at 3:30pm and after a brief detour to town was at my shore fishing spot at 4pm. A guy called Rob who I met 2 years ago at the same spot was there again. Him and his buddies have been coming up to the area for 20 years to moose hunt. We missed each other last year and had a good chat about what had gone on for both of us in the last 2 years.  Fishing was awesome and it was a fish a cast for the 2 hours we were there.
