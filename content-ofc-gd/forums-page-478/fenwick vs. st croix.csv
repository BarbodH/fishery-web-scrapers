631153,Moosebunk,2011-10-15 16:10:00,3970,"Can almost count on two hands how many Fenwicks I've broken.  1 Shimano too but that was Bull.  St.Croix's lower end rods are better than Fenwicks mid... but gawd... those walleye class rods I used to have were so nice and touchy with those little walleye tap taps, but then you'd sweep the hookset and snap the rod in half. lol."
631164,Alfiegee,2011-10-15 17:08:00,14,"Wow. I can't believe so many guys have broken rods. In 40 years I only remember breaking 1 rod and that was because a 70 lb roll of tar paper rolled over it in the back of my truck, totally my fault. I have a 10'6 St Croix Wild River and it is excellent. I have seen people break rods so I always carry a back up if you will. My Orvis 8'6 fly rod is always with me too. I don't think I can really call it a back up tho as it sees as much use as the St Croix. I also didn't see anyone mention Mitchell in this thread. I have a 7' Mitchell spinning rod that has been thru everything in the last 10 years since I got it. Including a 25 lb carp 3 weeks ago.  Alfie."

629882,Sharkbait22,2011-10-11 23:05:00,297,"I grew up fishing Fenwick.  This was back when there shop was in Niagara Falls 80s. They were the best rods or one of the best. They used to sell Woodstream products too.  You could buy ""seconds"" for very cheap.  My first steelhead rod was bought in 1984 - a second.  I still have it today although it’s been replaced many times.  I own several St.Croix rods too.  The Ultra Legend series is terrific. I've built several of these for fly rods. Fenwick quality may have decreased, however, I recently bought two (HMX) and I'm happy. St. Croix uses nice components for the price and they are a good company, but their gimmicky rods aren't my thing. Triumph rods are variable – I had one break.  Checking it out afterwards the spine was super thin on one side. Go for the lifetime warranty with St.Croix and you won’t go wrong.  But $$ where as Fenwick will honour 5 years but the price is lower.  BTW - Canadian Tire does sell St.Croix - Kenora I believe.  Also they have a centre in Mississauga for warranties."

629902,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-10-11 23:42:00,535,I bought a fenwick elite tech muskie rod from Crappy tire (got it on sale so I figured why not) but now you guys have me worried lol. Good thing I have another rod. I haven't had a problem with it so far but I haven't used it that much either.
629905,Roy,2011-10-11 23:52:00,13728, Handle it with care and there'll be no reason for it to break....usually.
629911,miller,2011-10-12 00:02:00,223,i work at a tackle shop and have heard great things about both brands but i must admit fenwick hands down is the most returned brand with broken tips and top ends. st croix used to be quite a hassle to deal with warranty and returns but thats no longer the case for us. we take a 20 dollar deposit for shipping and other fees and if we have the rod in stock we will hand you a new one then and there.
629920,EC1,2011-10-12 00:10:00,930,"Let's not start a fear campaign for everyone that uses Fenwicks. They definitely aren't at the top of the industry now, but I feel that they sure are a contender for $80 - 130 range.  The 2 times I did see a fenwick break, they were more in user fault. (Wrapped around tip and loaded up the rod, Trying to pull apart a beaver dam). And the warranty service has been good for me.  I sent it to the States, and had a new rod in just over a month. No, Fenwick doesn't sponsor me, but they sure can contact me here to do that  I also think that Elite Tech Smallmouth Series is looking mighty fine!"
629942,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-12 00:49:00,0,st. croix all the way if you don't mind spending the coin.
629981,adempsey,2011-10-12 01:54:00,1498,"Nothing really wrong with either IMO, but they address different markets.  St. Croix is a more premium brand and serves the mid-range ($80-$200) and high-end markets (>$200).  The lower priced products are assembled in Mexico, but the rest are from the USA.  Fenwick used to be a premium brand, but was bought out by Pure Fishing and they moved production to China [AFAIK anyway].  They primarily serve the low and mid-range market (<$150).  Of course, there is some overlap between the product lines based on price.  However, does Fenwick use the same quality blanks and other components as St. Croix in those products?   Maybe in some cases, but I'd guess they probably don't for the most part.  So, personally I'd go with St. Croix if I was looking for a rod in the mid-range price point."
629995,Eazy,2011-10-12 02:39:00,260,"St.Croix = made in USA.........Fenwick = made in CHINA.........That alone should tell you something, and personally, I'd gladly pay a few more bucks to support a North American company!"
630004,gogu392,2011-10-12 03:17:00,142,IMHO  No.1  G. Loomis No.2  St. Croix  After that the rest of the pack.
630178,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 19:05:00,5865,"25/30 years ago I built my own rods using Fenwick blanks that were warrantied  for life...that kit cost me $65 way back then....  Now I only purchase Cabela's Fish Eagle® II Spinning Rods which can be purchased for only $59.00...don't know who makes them, don't care.....I no longer pay for name brand stuff...Cabela's stands behind their products 100% and that's good enough for me."
630199,mercman,2011-10-12 20:18:00,7054," Made in China, does not always mean CHEAP.remember, they do not design the rod, they manufacture it to the specifications of the company they are making it for."
630202,mike rousseau,2011-10-12 20:25:00,4661,  then how come nothing in a dollar store comes from Canada...lol  i worked for a company that had other companies make their product to their specs... are stuff was great... the outsourced stuff was crap... and that is within our borders...
630208,mercman,2011-10-12 20:55:00,7054,"  For the dollar store stuff, lets just say, cheap labor force.For the company where you worked,who knows.Maybe if it had been made in China instead of within our borders, it may have been tastier Now, back to your regularly scheduled thread. Fenwick still makes a decent rod, for people who have a budget to follow.I have used mine for 2 years without a complaint.Its sensitive, light, strong enough for what i use it for, and comfortable to hold all day long while fishing.I probably wouldnt use it for walleye, or bigger fish, but thats why we all have differnt rods for differnt apps."
630213,Duckie,2011-10-12 21:12:00,305,"  agreed.  these two manufacturers are far ahead in terms of design, actions etc.  you really don't know until you cast a higher end offering from SC or Loomis.  everyone else is playing catch up.  I have a fenwick from the late 90s that was made in the USA and it is a great rod.  but its heavy for its rating.  one thing that both SC and Loomis do better than most of the others is make light blanks.  I don't bother with the other brands anymore. if I am going to spend money on a rod, I save up for one of the mid to high range offerings from these two."
630234,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 21:58:00,5865," Mike, you have to go to the ""loonie"" store..."
630529,RobbieTheM,2011-10-13 16:22:00,35,I have both and they are both great companies. GLoomis is the only better as far as I am concerned!
630561,torco,2011-10-13 17:51:00,656,Love my St.Croix fly rods! I had a Fenwick when I was a kid and it broke rather easily but that was many years and may have had more to do with me.
630656,Ralph Field,2011-10-14 00:01:00,1018,I own both types of rods and have never had problems with either. I have to agree with what some of the other respondents have said that I would buy a St. Croix over a Fenwick today because Fenwick is now owned by Berkley. St. Croix rods are at least built in North America.
630695,michigander fisherman,2011-10-14 02:03:00,64,I have a st croix premier baitcasting rod and i absolutely love it. i feel everything that touches my lure but i also mosly use it for pike fishing so i use a braided line which helps with the feel too.
630776,ohhenrygsr,2011-10-14 14:15:00,947,"I love my Fenwick Techna rods, than they came out with the elite series and I lost interest in Fenwick. I'm kinda lost right now with rod buying.  I think I'll give the 2012 Shimano Compre's a try. I also have some of last years Quantum Tour edition rods before they downgraded there tour edition to a cheaper blank. I've got both the old and newer Tour edition rods, they don't seem that bad."
630790,snowdown,2011-10-14 15:19:00,24,both are good.
630793,ps40102,2011-10-14 15:32:00,3,"As far as Float Rods and Fly rods go, I think Fenwick makes a great product(gotta look @ price point) Myself I Own a 10""6 HMX and a 13 SAGE love em both!!"
630794,troutologist,2011-10-14 15:33:00,951,"I have to say I'm much more impressed with St Croix rods than Fenwick. I've only had 1 issue with St Croix and it was dealt with quickly and for $20...it was a client rod and was subjected to just about anything one could imagine. In my opinion, they are a premiere rod maker and offer excellent customer service.  I do have one 15yr old HMX which has been a go to for countless portage trips for trout that has stood up well. Also a Techna AV muskie rod that has been great. Besides these, I've blown up 5 or 6 other Fenwicks in the last 5 yrs....made the switch to St Croix and have broke none.  In the end the brand doesn't mean as much as its feel to you. The brand usually means reliability and warranty."
629706,bassmaster4,2011-10-11 14:46:00,801,"I recently picked up a fenwick HMG 6'6 ML spinning rod at a local tackle shop and i am happy with my purchase,my buddy has been telling me that st. croix rods are far more superior in quality to the fenwick rods.(i tend to disagree but i have no problems with st. croix and would gladly buy another) I was an owner of a St.Croix triumph that snapped while fighting a pike (mainly my fault). I was just wondering about your guys opinions on st. Croix rods vs. fenwick rods which company would you rather go with or what is your personal preference and why? Thanks in advance bassmaster4"
629714,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 14:56:00,4661,First off... Triumph is the cheapest st.croix you can get...  Premiers are good...  I love my avid  And my brother has some legends and they are incredible...   Fenwick is at Canadian tire now... Wich says a lot...  Fenwick quality has gone downhill...
629716,cjgraham,2011-10-11 14:57:00,104,I'm a Fenwick guy all the way. I own an HMX and absolutly love it. I've heard a few stories about St Croix's snapping. Could just be that they are more popular though. They seem to be all the rage right now kinda like shimano was back in the day.
629717,lew,2011-10-11 14:57:00,12766,"I'd go with St. Croix, I've seen quite a few Fenwicks, including brand new, break for no reason, but only talking about the musky series."
629719,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-11 15:00:00,2690,"Twenty years ago, I'd have said Fenwick...now, St Croix for sure.  Had a Fenwick snap off with hardly any force on it while up north this year."
629720,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 15:03:00,4661,I had a brand new fenwick spinning rod snap below the first eye on a piece of rush bed grass... Barely pulled...
629721,scugpg,2011-10-11 15:03:00,1373,"St. Croix! But if you are worried about warranty etc, check your dealer for warranty procedure. I've never had to warranty mine (knock on wood) but I have heard that you have to ship and pay shipping. Some dealers do over the counter on some brands....even if its a small charge it beats sending it away."
629722,EC1,2011-10-11 15:04:00,930,"I'm pretty sure there is a huge St. Croix fanbase going around all over north america, and they are really are good rods! The triumph can't be the judge, as I'd say you need to try the Avid to really see how good they are.  At the same time, I love my Fenwicks. I had a 6'0MH Walleye class that was beautiful for fishing senkos, until I broke it. Then, I had access to an HMX 6'10MH - This one seemed kind of heavy and not very sensitive. But, this is also the cheapest fenwick I've held. (an $80 rod in the 90's paid for a lot more rod than a new $80 rod does now.) Now I currently have a 6'6M HMGAV(Long discontinued) and a 6'6MH HMG - 2 beautiful rods that handles everything beautifully.  Fenwick is one of the most underrated rod companies out there now. The older guys will probably have to explain how they were the leaders in the industry at one point way back when.  Another thing to keep in mind is that a rod doesn't make you a better fisherman. It all comes down to YOU, time on the water, and lots and lots of practice."
629724,bassmaster4,2011-10-11 15:07:00,801,"ouch looks like my buddy is right, this wouldnt stop me from buying another fenwick or st. croix, keep in mind i was not judging st.croix rods just because my triumph broke. Thanks for everyones input! keep the replies coming i am interested in hearing more opinions."
629726,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 15:18:00,4661,St.croix has awesome customer service...  I broke a ten foot wild river rod... My fault totally... They have a set up where you can buy the replacement tip section for 30 bucks...!
629736,Roy,2011-10-11 15:56:00,13728,"Fenwicks were a decent rod 40 years ago. If they work well for you, great but they really DO have a bad reputation for blowing up."
629737,registerfly,2011-10-11 15:57:00,198," I wish my replacement/warranty was rectified that quickly. It's been 2.5 months going and it's not even a St Croix company issue per se. Indirectly yes it is, but my dealer is great and gave me an avid in place of my son's legend for the time being. That just reflects the dealer, not St Croix, so take it for what it's worth. Last I heard no one made an indestructible fishing rod unless we all want to fish flagpoles. As for rod company choice, go with what you want to, we all make purchase decisions based solely on personal reasons and objectives. If it feels right in the hand then you will know. BTW are they even in the same pricing category? Doesn't seem to make sense trying to decide between 2 rods if one is double or triple the cost. Unless you are trying to purchase based only on $ and not type of rod and application, ie Fenwick's more expensive against St. Croix entry level rod."
629738,Roy,2011-10-11 16:03:00,13728,"And FYI, go to the Fenwick site http://www.fenwickfishing.com/ and read what it says on the cover page. Those four words alone should give you an idea as to their competence.  Fenwick answers Bassmaster's question themselves."
629740,Jigger,2011-10-11 16:04:00,1237,"Bought a fenwick spinning rod. It broke. Sent it back, they replaced it with a new one. It broke. I bought better rods. Was happy."
629744,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 16:16:00,5784,"The Fenwick Highlander goes on sale at CT for 49.99 sometimes... Best rod for that price and CT has an easy return policy, although I've havnt had to use it in 3yrs. I'm VERY hard on equipment but I like quality... The Highlander is the answer for me. It sounds like the St.Coixs are in a different league nowdays, but for 50.00 I will take the Fenwick anyday thank you very much."
629761,adolson,2011-10-11 16:51:00,783," CT's customer service is sometimes sketchy in my area... (I believe the company as a whole changed their policies in recent times, but I could be wrong on that). Be sure you ask them about it, and if it were me, I'd be getting it writing.    Some day, when I have extra money, I plan to get a St. Croix. Until then, my $50 rod with lifetime warranty will do."
629771,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 17:11:00,4661,"You gotta think this way...  Sure you can buy 2 or 3 replacement 50 dollar rods for what I paid for my st.croix avid...  But that means 2-3 ruined fishing days... 2-3 trips back to the store... 2-3 times dealing with the highschool kid at costumer service... And you are using a lower quality rod...  What's your day on the water worth to you?  In my experience... If you can afford the ""investment"" on a higher end rod... You'll be happier in the end...   Also my brother broke a st.croix legend (his fault) flipping a 5lb walleye and ""fumbled"" the ending... Lol  He contacted st.croix about what happened... They said it sounds like a defect... So my brother said he didn't wanna wait 1-2 months for a new rod... So they sent him a new one charged to his credit card... And when they received the broken rod... Reimbursed him... The new rod was here in less then a week..."
629772,F_ast,2011-10-11 17:18:00,154,I have had good luck with some my HMG AV stuff.  It is one of their higher end muskie rods though.  They have seen a ton of fish... But these rods are several years old now.  Not a complaint out of my St.Croix stuff.
629782,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 17:35:00,5784,"  Haha it's not that bad. I've never had a ruined fishing day because of my $50 rod. The only Fenwick I ever broke was the victim of my car door. I bring a $20 spare with me everywhere I go and it serves me just fine.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have a Top Quality rod, but unless you have Top Quality rod holders/carrybags/protectors/boat etc. it hardly seems worth the ""accident"" factor. It all depends on your fishing style.  Either way, according to the masses, it sounds like the overall quality of the St-Croix's is better than the Fenwicks... but for $50 for a rod that is much better than anything else on the shelf, I'll take the Fenwick Highlander. Just my opinion of course."
629811,mercman,2011-10-11 19:31:00,7054,"I have a 6'6'' MF fenwick HMX, paired with a Pflueger Asaro, and really enjoy fishing with it.Mind you i have only used it for LMB, but i have caught some nice fish on it.Its super sensitive in my hands. My other rods are either Quantum, or Shimano. I hope to get a St.Croix Musky rod for Chritmas so i can pair it with the Calcutta TE 400 that Santa may get me. As you can see, i am not a brand loyal angler, and i fish with what feels good in my hands, rather than what the big advertising moguls tell me is best.  "
