631391,Tybo,2011-10-16 16:02:00,1373,What is this suppose to mean. My dad was the most responsible man I knew and mom was mature. But their would have been no chance that I would buy a vehicle from them. They both loved to drive and pounded the snott out of there vehicles.
631393,misfish,2011-10-16 16:05:00,29133,What happen to you?  What ever sells I guess.
631398,Joey,2011-10-16 16:21:00,9122,"Uh ya, I can attest to the fact his mom was mature, but I'd never get in a vehicle with her at the helm"
631433,Fisherman,2011-10-16 19:17:00,7201,"In the believable world, it usually means that it's a person who takes care of whatever they're trying to sell. For instance if you bought something from me such as an ATV, you can be rest assured I didn't drive it like some goatee bearded monkey on steroids trying to drown it in a mudbog or seeing how much air they could get before crashing back to earth.  That's the same as ""mint condition"", everybody thinks their XX year old stuff is mint. No, mint is when it's new out of the box or barely used.  Anyway, no goatee bearded monkeys have complained about my reference to their use of steroids.. yet."

631440,glen,2011-10-16 19:39:00,2641,How much $ do you want?
631442,Terry,2011-10-16 19:58:00,14456,so far all I got from this thread is    I am not mature  people who have seen me drive my  atv  skidoo boat  truck can attest to it
631472,Rich,2011-10-16 22:40:00,3927,Because someone's appearance is a sure sign of maturity level.
