630531,RobbieTheM,2011-10-13 16:24:00,35,That is a beauty unit. I have been in many nice huts before but that one may take the cake! Enjoy it!
630542,motion,2011-10-13 17:04:00,403,Nice hut Simon. Looks like you're going to be fishing in style (and comfort) this winter. Cant wait for the ice myself. I was out looking at new huts in Basspro Shops last night. Just got my second sled this year and my son and I will be cruising as soon as its safe! Bring on the cold weather........
630543,tb4me,2011-10-13 17:04:00,3295,Nice Simon! Good score my man..Let me know what weekend works best for company this winter...lol. Anyway I was wondering if your sled will pull that hut out on the lake? Do you have a quad? That beast will be heavy I'm sure. Anyway congrats my man! Get a battery operated TV and a high def. antenna and you can watch the leafs make the playoffs while fishing in style this winter.
630582,Harrison,2011-10-13 18:47:00,2202," Good someone else caught that too!  Perfect gift simon, I see your right on the water.  Forget about being in the ""dog house"", you can go to the ""Ice hut""."
630585,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-13 19:06:00,2690,"Bang, Bang on the door baby!!!!!!!!!  Very nice Simon!!  Enjoy...can't wait to see the videos."

630602,mike rousseau,2011-10-13 20:31:00,4661,hey simon....  id wait to put the insulation on...  your gunna have a wood fire burning a couple feet away from you...  i insulated my shack... and heated with a propane heater...  cooked us out on low... and wood fire is way hotter...  so i say try it out... if you find it chilly... the insulate it on the ice... its not hard to do...
630705,limeyangler,2011-10-14 03:10:00,5204,"thanks for the replies folks, yup...its going on our lake...just round the corner on the ice road though.  I'm glad a few of you caught on (at last) to the B52s references   Musky mike...good advice...will see how it goes first although i think i will put up the heat shield before the ice comes."

628971,Grimace,2011-10-08 20:11:00,2020,That is fantastic.  I wish I had one.
628975,Sandbag,2011-10-08 20:25:00,533,That's awesome Simon...looks like a beauty>  That little stove will have you fishing in your short pants all winter long.  Is it going on your lake?  Cheers  Craig
628976,misfish,2011-10-08 20:26:00,29133,"No need to go home til sunday now.LOL   Very generous friend.    Good thing it,s only 2 and an 3rd eh Simon."
629007,Rod Caster,2011-10-08 22:06:00,5784,nice gift. Good times ahead for the family!
629030,Joey,2011-10-09 00:05:00,9122,"That is a thing of beauty Simon, very generous of your neighbour.  Wow, you're gonna have a great hard water season bud"
629036,Fisherman,2011-10-09 00:30:00,7201,"Sweet, a couple of reclining high back bucket seats on swivels, popcorn shaker for the stove and you've got a fine hut."
629041,adolson,2011-10-09 00:42:00,783,Lucky for you! Too bad the snow has been postponed for this year. It will resume its regularly-scheduled stupidity in November 2012.
629044,Fishnwire,2011-10-09 00:47:00,983,"That's a heck of a gift!  I wish I had a neigbour like yours.  I'm sure you'll have some good times with it.  ""Tin roof...rusted!"""
629064,limeyangler,2011-10-09 01:43:00,5204," I'm thinking the house warming will be around 12th December.    Yes Craig....i think i'm gonna join our little ice shanty village on the ice road to town this year....Jack has already made some friends with some of the old timers there.    LOL...they grow quick though....he is getting one of these next Xmas....another neighbour in the bay has put it aside for us at a great price (her son is too big for it now)       Cant wait for the season....fired up the snow machine today...3 pulls and she fired right up    lol...  :worthy:   What the hell...yoiu trying to JINX it or what...grrrrrrr.     Yup...they are good neighbours who will be sadly missed.  They are moving further north for job reasons, and they have stored a whole heap of stuff behind the tree line of our property to get it out of the way as requested by the realtor...  the shack was his way of saying thanks for the temporary storage...really nice of them!"
629103,Big Cliff,2011-10-09 11:58:00,6899,Beautiful! I think I am going to build one for this winter. Enjoy!
629150,adolson,2011-10-09 15:57:00,783, I hope so! Let's skip straight to spring!
629159,The Urban Fisherman,2011-10-09 16:18:00,2050,Simon that is bad-ass! What a wicked neighbor - hope you bought him a case of beer or maybe his wife a bottle of wine! ;o) hope you enjoy!
629163,MJL,2011-10-09 16:42:00,2427,"I want one too...The only ice shack I have is my survival suit...And my epidermis  If you paint the bottom of the hut white, you'll be stealthy on the ice and the fish won't be able to see you.LOL"
629166,limeyangler,2011-10-09 16:51:00,5204, have you ever ice fished dana?
629172,Nipfisher,2011-10-09 17:02:00,2449,"Very nice Simon That stove will keep you very warm. Did you neighbor ""skin"" a few construction workers? Further South of here the farmers shoot the ground-hogs and hang them on fence posts to show them off."
629213,adolson,2011-10-09 19:31:00,783,"Yep, years ago I went a few times.. Didn't enjoy it as much as real fishing. hahaha  In all seriousness, I want to get into it because it'll help make winter pass quicker and with company it could be a good time. I wish I had a snow machine but I need a truck long before toys like that. If I get a hut myself, it'll probably be a portable tent type I think, because then I can carry it to various lakes and it'll fit in my car and stuff... I need an auger and some other gear too, so this might not happen this year. I don't even know much about it all to be honest, like when is it safe for a fatty like me to step on the ice, or where to drill holes, etc. I have a lot to learn because prior to this year, almost all of my fishing was done with adults when I was a kid or teen, and I didn't pay much attention."
629215,Spiel,2011-10-09 19:50:00,9065,"That's pretty sweet Simon, no doubt you'll get maximum use out of it.  Just a thought though, some rigid insulation between the studs will make it t-shirt cozy!"
629217,Fisherman,2011-10-09 19:54:00,7201," Yes, one inch pink panther styrofoam works like a charm and is almost weightless."
629227,limeyangler,2011-10-09 20:21:00,5204,    I was thinking the same thing guys.  Would i not then need to put up board on the inside too?
629229,Spiel,2011-10-09 20:24:00,9065," No, but you may want to put some sheet aluminium (spaced off the frame a 1/2 inch) in the corner behind the wood stove or leave that lower corner free of insulation."
629249,Fisherman,2011-10-09 22:42:00,7201,"If you can't find aluminum as a heat shield for the back area of the stove, go and get the largest diameter round duct you can find at your local hardware store.  An 8 inch diameter pipe opens to 24 inches wide and usually comes about 4 feet long.  2 of those are pretty cheap, galvanized and won't rust."

629325,limeyangler,2011-10-10 04:07:00,5204,    Thanks guys...good tips!
