631635,motion,2011-10-17 14:41:00,403,"Mike, you seemed to have done more in one summer than most of us dream about doing in a lifetime. My hat goes off to you!"
630906,S.M.05,2011-10-14 20:08:00,145,"Every summer I think is gonna be less busy than the last.......... and every summer I'm wrong. A day off a week has been welcome, at one point it was 4 weeks straight without a day off between work and other jobs.  I did sneak away for a fish any chance I got though, even if it was just for an evening walleye or brown trout fish and I seemed to have done all right.  Here's a bunch o pics of my summer.   The family of Cooper's Hawks returned this spring.     First trout in the new square back.         A quick trip got me into a new P.Best inland brown.       A couple of evening trips for eyes.           Campfire Sweet Chilli Thai wings. Mmmmmmmm.       Overnight trip for bows.         Had a weekend to explore and got into to a back lake full of these laker imitators. Caught 7 and missed another 5 by noon before the storms rolled in.         While talking with this fella over a chipmunk dinner he mentioned an elusive trout.       ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!!!!             Looks like the fall is here along with a weeks worth of well needed vacation.  Fall Spec   Fall splake    Hope you enjoyed."

630940,S.M.05,2011-10-14 21:15:00,145," Yes the golden Aurora Trout, largest one I have caught yet."
630945,S.M.05,2011-10-14 21:25:00,145," 6 trout species.  At first I thought it had hurt its wings, then I realized he was crushing his meal for a couple mins before he dug in. Couldnt tell what he was snacking on till I got too close and he flew away holding the chipmunk.  Oh well one less tree rat"
630954,Rod Caster,2011-10-14 21:47:00,5784," 6 trout! I need to relearn how to count.  Ok, I got the impression it was you guys eating the chipmunks... I have only tried squirrel. Haha"
630955,Ron,2011-10-14 21:47:00,1683,"  Yes, I think I can speak for everyone on this post...  WE ALL ENJOYED!  Seems like you found yourself a little piece of Heaven. All these species found relatively close to you?  Cheers, Ron..."
630959,d_paluch,2011-10-14 22:00:00,343,"amazing report  what beautiful fish/scenery. I have never targeted or for that matter, caught a trout before. They sure are gorgeous creatures"

631142,Moosebunk,2011-10-15 15:41:00,3970,"Much nicer seeing some of those pics off the camera screen and blown up big here.  NEVER can I remember, ANYONE posting about 6 trout species all caught within a summer.  That aurora takes the cake Mike just because, but man... that brown, that splake...  You never fail to impress each year with your Grandslam 5 trout reports... but this year with 6 ya hit it out of the park then rounded two more bases for a double.  WarCanoe... lakers... hopefully soon."

631400,S.M.05,2011-10-16 16:26:00,145,"Glad everyone enjoyed these as much as I did.  Ron all of those trout species are within a few hours of home except for the Aurora trout.  Bunk a trip in the war canoe would be ultra cool. Just pick a Sunday or Monday  Even with these 25-30km winds, rain and a wicked cold keeping me away from the lakes for the last half of my vacation I managed 2 solid days of fantastic fall spec fishn."
