631211,Fisherman,2011-10-15 20:17:00,7201,CarQuest and NAPA both have what you need by the foot.
631213,danbouck,2011-10-15 20:51:00,4380,Parts source too I believe
631240,davey buoy,2011-10-15 22:10:00,5505,"Too add,any plumbing/hyd hose supplier will have what you need."

631371,SlowPoke,2011-10-16 14:53:00,2984,I assume you've already checked Hose Headquarters?
631375,Tybo,2011-10-16 15:18:00,1373,Make sure it ethanol compatible.Diesels don't need it. So there is alot of fuel line out their that isn't.
631416,scugpg,2011-10-16 17:56:00,1373, Not yet will give them a call this week
