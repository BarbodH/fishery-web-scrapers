630942,Bigworm,2011-10-14 21:17:00,119,"Going to be around Hay Bay, Thompson's, Sherman's and possibly down past Aldolphus and the ferry. Anyone getting any fish through that stretch yet?   Thanks in advance."
630993,Terry,2011-10-14 23:34:00,14456,looks like no one around here has been fishing it  I would like to know how it's been too  can't wait for when I get down there
630994,mike rousseau,2011-10-14 23:36:00,4661,X3  I'm itching to head up...
631103,superdad,2011-10-15 13:21:00,353,"There have been reports of some fish in Adolphus Reach and some fish caught at the Upper Gap.  A couple weeks ago there were lots of fish (tyoe unknown) between Thompsons and Shermans, we got one around 4.5lbs.  The next few days it's going be BREEZY....................  Lotsa Luck  David  aka  Superdad"
631147,Cosmos,2011-10-15 15:57:00,588,"I was fishing Picton Bay last weekend.  Didn't get any walleye, perch bite was on all day. Saw one boat who hooked a walleye, talked to the guy - it was around 3 lbs, no more fish for him. He said it's too warm, need to wait couple weeks at least."
631149,Moosebunk,2011-10-15 16:03:00,3970,"Superdad... it's ironic how a couple weeks ago while there, dodging weedmats over 65C I too picked up one of those 4.5'ers.  Hopefully the strong consistent winds this weekend blowing out of the reach push some of that hot water out."
631172,fishhunter,2011-10-15 17:40:00,604,If you put the time in you will find fish. Lots of bait around so watch your sonar for fish on the bait. Best speed for me has been1.9
631222,BFSC Kevin,2011-10-15 21:11:00,1351,I assume that is 1.9 water speed and not 1.9 gps?
631224,Thrasher,2011-10-15 21:20:00,39,What are the temps like right now?
631225,Terry,2011-10-15 21:24:00,14456, I would think GPS
631244,Harrison,2011-10-15 22:33:00,2202,"Supposed to have fished the gap today but postponed until Mon.  Friends report fish, however still deeper then I like to fish."
631252,fishhunter,2011-10-15 23:21:00,604,Gps speed. Lots of fish in safe fishing depths above 30'. With all this wind things will be a mess for a few days. Guys that fish for fish deeper then 30' are not thinking of the well being of the fish. Unless your keeping the fish you catch deep then I see no reason to take a chance damaging the fish.
631389,Grimace,2011-10-16 15:54:00,2020,Those deep fish are not biters anyway.    I have always found that the fish higher up are the biters.
