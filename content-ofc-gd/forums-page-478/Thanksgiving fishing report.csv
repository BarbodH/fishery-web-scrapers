629739,GBW,2011-10-11 16:04:00,8460,"Well thanksgiving has come and gone and this is one that I will remember for a long, long time.  We went to my folks place on the lake Saturday afternoon.  So I take off for an hour to get some fishing in trying to get me a nice fresh walleye for dinner.  No dice.  All I caught was just bass…  I gave up and went back to the cottage.  As the day was turning to evening I figured I would give it one last shot.  Packed my jigging rod in the boat and set off to find me a walleye or two.  After a few more bass I get a solid thump.  I’m thinking, oh man here’s either a huge fall smallie or a real hog of a walleye!  It’s now getting dark out and hard to see but as I look down all I see is a massive tail as the fish is heading under the tinny.  I’m about 250/300 feet away from the cottage, I can hear them talking and sure enough when I see the tail   “Oh damn it’s a huge Musky!” was sort of how it went.  Lucky for me the kids’ didn’t hear that…  Here I am fighting the biggest musky I have ever seen in this lake (and I’ve seen a few sight fishing for them at opener!) on a cheap spinning combo with 12LB nanofil line!!  The fish decided to take one last run as I reach for the net and I’m lucky my drag was set just right.  It took about 45’ of line out as it mad it’s dive away from the boat.  I managed to get all that line back rather quick, get the net ready and land it!  This fish was AMAZING looking!!!!  I got it unhooked in the net in the water and was reaching for my b.berry to take a pic when it decides to do a death roll in the net.  It had part of the net in its jaw so being the rookie musky guy that I am I went for the pliers to help free the fish, D’OH!  Down they go to the bottom of the lake…  So I get the fish freed up and think, ok, now is it pic time?  I bring it in the boat and get it ready, no chance as I almost lost the phone and now I had the fish out for 20 seconds and said the hell with it, the fish going back means more to me!  So now the fish is back in the lake and I’ve got it by the tail, only cause that’s the safest place to hold it in my mind!  I get the tape measure out and I’m ready to see how big this amazing, gorgeous green monster is…  I have the tape hooked (well laying) in front of its nose and just as I’m getting to the tail and reading between 43 and 45” long it decides it’s spent enough time with me…  So I call it a night and head back in to be questions by everyone “where is the fish?” and further comments like “we could hear you but not clearly and we could see you with the net, what happened to the fish?”.  To my reply of it was a musky, I had to let it go!  Sure enough the “well, where are the pic’s of it?” came out and then I had to educate them on how fragile they are and that I wasn’t going to drag it back to the cottage for a pic as I would have killed it doing so.  Needless to say my wife and father are the two that had seen me with the net standing in the boat and a ‘big fish’ in it as it went from dusk to dark.  It was my last fish for 2011 from that lake because I decided to end my season there on a high note.  Thankfully I had the huge net with me or all I would have is the memory of the big fish that got away…  Thanks for reading.  Geoff"
629742,Jigger,2011-10-11 16:11:00,1237,Atta boy Geoff! Nothing wrong with the only pic of that fish being in your head! You did good and the fishing gods will reward your goodwill toward that ski.
629743,Carp,2011-10-11 16:16:00,1488,Great story ! Thanks for sharing and congrats.
629746,mercman,2011-10-11 16:19:00,7054,"SIGH.............I'd really like to believe you Geoff.....but               JK !!! Best advice is to stay calm, let the fish calm down, and do what you did, release it as quickly as you can, and enjoy the story telling for years to come."
629749,Terry,2011-10-11 16:31:00,14456,"these days  if it's not caught on video or camera, did it really happen       LOL    sounds like a good way to end the season...."

629793,Joey,2011-10-11 18:10:00,9122,I believe you Geoff  Sounds like that was a really exciting end of season for you.  At least you know it is there now and can go catch it again and get a pic next time

629809,GBW,2011-10-11 19:21:00,8460,"Thanks all, I think...   Come smell the net or take a DNA (or is it ESA or MSA?) sample off the net.    I can get the jig out it killed and post a pic of it if needed..."
629891,mercman,2011-10-11 23:25:00,7054, Ya cant mistake that smell eh Geoff? It sticks on ya for a while
629901,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 23:42:00,5784,"Haha ""...just bass.""  What a catch man! When fishing for musky do you recommend that I tip my 1/4oz jig with a worm?"
629992,ccmtcanada,2011-10-12 02:26:00,7971,Nice going Geoff!  Suuuuuure you got a Muskie....I believe ya!  I caught one on a jig at Big Cliff's Sunday but didn't bother replying it....who'd believe me? Lol  Sounded exciting man!  Sure gets the adrenaline running doesn't it?
630000,Kwan,2011-10-12 03:11:00,132,"reminds me of how i caught mine a while ago, no camera just a memory."
630013,young_one,2011-10-12 05:23:00,620,"""where is the fish?"""
630081,Headhunter,2011-10-12 12:50:00,5703,"What with your recent issues with regard to your ""honesty"", the only thing I can be sure of from this report, is that you were out on the lake in the dark, screaming like a school girl... it was dark after all! HH"
630092,Lunkerhunter,2011-10-12 13:26:00,455,quick release pic or one in the net while it was still in the water would have been some good evidence. lol glad you were thinking of the fish first.
630200,mercman,2011-10-12 20:21:00,7054,   I wouldn't have put it quite like that.   ya....i guess i woulda
