629596,SHINNY,2011-10-11 03:08:00,39,"k, so im getting a new float reel and its gonna be a islander steelheading but dont know what colour, idk if i should get gold or silver so which ever has the most, i guess ill get that colour. lol"
629602,GoneFishin,2011-10-11 03:28:00,349,"purple.  Are you really asking a question like that on here? I could see if maybe you were worried about the glare from sun shining off it but come on, what color do you like better?"
629606,SHINNY,2011-10-11 03:50:00,39,"  well im trying to decide between silver and gold, its a just a qeustion."
629607,MJL,2011-10-11 04:05:00,2427,"If you go with gold, you can have the best of both worlds...After banging the reel on rocks or sliding it across a rough concrete pier, it will eventually turn into silver..."
629610,OutdoorDan,2011-10-11 04:28:00,325,"Personally I think silver looks much better in those reel in the water and fish alongside rod handle shots, especially against fall backgrounds."
629618,ChrisK,2011-10-11 09:15:00,2772,"Dev, I like the green Islander Right now Devon is using my back up reel ""Floatmaster"" and he has the Walace cast down to a T. He went 1 for 3 Steelhead this weekend where I got a big goose egg and the kid is only 14. Go for the gold Dev !!"
629622,solopaddler,2011-10-11 09:26:00,8605,I'll throw in a vote for silver.
629630,Roy,2011-10-11 09:53:00,13728,"Strictly from an esthetics perspective, I'd say that silver might not stand out as well with chromers. Silver would be visually pleasing with browns and speckleds. Gold would probably clash with your riverwear. I don't think that green is a pin type colour but it might be your only option."
629688,Ralph Field,2011-10-11 13:49:00,1018,"I owned a gold Islander and enjoyed fishing it. What I've noticed in watching the classified adds for reels is that gold reels are not sought after with comments like, ""NO GOLD PLEASE"" so I would go with silver so you will have an easier time selling it later on. I loved the look of my gold Islander. I think the black Islanders are hard anodised and therefore more sought after, but my gold reel had no marks on it after 5 years of hard fishing."
630079,craigdritchie,2011-10-12 12:42:00,1586,"Why don't you just get a back one? Then you won't have to worry about glare, or having the sun shine of it and spook the fish."
630091,BillM,2011-10-12 13:22:00,17367,I heard the champagne Frogwater is nice looking *cough* I have one for sale *cough*  lol!
630156,msp,2011-10-12 18:12:00,1336,"A wise steelheader once told me.... "" Its not about how many fish you catch, but how good you look doing it """
630584,linweir,2011-10-13 19:03:00,202,Silver for sure.
630610,solopaddler,2011-10-13 20:49:00,8605, You know as long as I've been fishing trout I've heard that said.  Never once has the shine of a reel spooked any steelhead I've encountered.  I could see the merit if you're fly fishing a tiny spring creek and have to crawl on your belly on your approach and cast blindly to the fish. Otherwise...  Perhaps this could be an episode of myth busters.
630611,Bill Shearer,2011-10-13 20:57:00,456,"Have to agree with Mike, Buy the colour that looks good to you, and on your rod! Fish really could care less!"
630613,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-13 21:23:00,4399,"with gold at 1600.00 or so dollars a ounce I would definately go for the silver one but thats only if it matches your rod, after all you don`t want to clash on the river!"
630622,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-13 21:46:00,0,i like silver myself.
630624,davey buoy,2011-10-13 21:50:00,5505,"shinny,if you haven't used one yet,believe me colour is the least of your problems.Just saying:rolleyes:"
630625,Victor,2011-10-13 21:51:00,1609,how come no one mentioned grey? Or people just don't like it?  Personally Grey would be my favourite ... however I couldn't find one used while I was looking for mine and opted for the 2nd option - Black.
630640,MJL,2011-10-13 23:09:00,2427," That’s because they saw the reel miles away and already knew you were coming  My matt black Angspecs are coated with the same finish used on stealth aircraft and are impervious to steelhead radar above and below water .  The reels don’t exist to steelhead until they’ve been captured, unhooked and had their pictures taken with the reel lying next to them in the water"
630712,GoneFishin,2011-10-14 06:04:00,349,So what rod will you be slapping it onto?
630896,SHINNY,2011-10-14 19:29:00,39,  11 foot fenwick till i get a new one
631305,craigdritchie,2011-10-16 05:48:00,1586,"Never been an issue for me either, but figured I'd throw it out there for fun!  Definitely a job for the Mythbusters."
631336,dave524,2011-10-16 12:03:00,4508,Now I have had a couple of guys move onto the far bank of a pool wearing bright yellow rainsuits and shut it down after I'd been getting fish steadily in my camo deerhunt raingear
631337,ChrisK,2011-10-16 12:09:00,2772,Now that there's a show stopper for sure....Got to love it when that happens !!
