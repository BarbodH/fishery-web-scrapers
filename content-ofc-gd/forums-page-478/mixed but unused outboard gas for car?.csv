631403,lplp,2011-10-16 16:44:00,83,"I have used gas from 2 years old,, dont worry about it, i dont even use stabilizer,, you dont need it now a days ,they put so mcuh stuff in gas now,, dont put in car either, nowadays with all the electronics and sensors will screw it up for sure .use in lawn mower if anything or anything 2 stroke , or i will pick it up and use it next year if you are that worried about it."
630153,saneryin,2011-10-12 17:55:00,39,"I have a 20-Liter of 1:40 mixed outboard gas in a gas tank. never have chance to used it.  It was freshly filled on July 15.  can I used it for me car? if so,  - does the outboard engine oil that mixed in will affect my car?  - is the gas already too old for me car even there is no mixed engine oil?  - what if I add 5L to my car each time. and used them out in 4 weeks?  any suggestion?  thanks."
630154,NAW,2011-10-12 18:08:00,4022,"I've done it once or twice in the past..  Didn't mess up my car.  Probly not the best thing to do though..  I've also done the same thing with my lawn mower, when I ran out of gas cuting grass.  It also ran fine with an oil mixture.  I'm not a mechanic, but I'm sure a few people here will give an exact answer."
630159,spinnerbaitking,2011-10-12 18:19:00,1622,"I've done it quite often, dump it in & fill it up, it's not 40:1 any more, had no problems that I know of yet SBK"
630167,tb4me,2011-10-12 18:46:00,3295,with the price of gas i would do the same thing..It would be useless in an outboard by next spring anyway..Add it to your tank and fill it up.
630194,skinny,2011-10-12 20:00:00,442,it shouldn't hurt anything do not do it if your soon going for etest only because it is oil in the fuel it could mess up the readings  I do it all the time
630206,scugpg,2011-10-12 20:42:00,1373,Wouldn't it coat o2 sensors etc? I'd be more inclined to use in weed whacker etc instead of my car with all the sensors etc.
630207,danbouck,2011-10-12 20:53:00,4380,I did it once in my 81 chev pickup but didn't realize it until i started it. The neighbors were not happy lol
630210,otter649,2011-10-12 20:57:00,118,    Any left over gas for my outboard (Merc 8) that carries over to the spring - I put a gas stablizer in the tank for the winter with no problems starting up the motor in the spring......
630214,bigbuck,2011-10-12 21:15:00,2449,"Drop some Stabil in it and it'll be fine for next year. If you want to use it, 5L at a time in the car will be fine, the oil would become so diluted it won't harm a thing."
630350,Rizzo,2011-10-13 01:06:00,4754,wow I never would have considered doing such a thing. The leftover mixed fuel I have from the summer is being used to start bonfires in the back yard! Maybe I should toss a few litres in the truck...although that would make my next fire less spectacular
630357,limeyangler,2011-10-13 01:15:00,5204,Leftover outboard gas...how the hell did you manage that!!???  :dunno:
630439,tb4me,2011-10-13 05:06:00,3295,Ha ha awesome Limey...I was thinking the same thing
630454,BITEME,2011-10-13 11:21:00,1968,Am I missing something here because if I have that much left I just leave it in the tank and run it next year never had any problems weed wackers lawn mowers or boats even dirt bikes not even a chug  jm2cw  Peter
630467,Billy Bob,2011-10-13 12:05:00,5865,Your options are:  1) add some fuel stabilizer like Sta-Bil and use in outboard next spring  2) add it to the truck/car/suv tank and be done with it  3) Have Billy Bob over for a nice dinner and I will take care of your excessive fuel problems at no charge.....  note: #3 is the safest option going....
630472,chuckymcd,2011-10-13 12:19:00,144,"I would not do it, cars are ment to be run on straight gas not a mixture, I would not take the chance but thats just me"
630486,wallyboss,2011-10-13 13:37:00,1095,Marine Stabil and use it next year.
630495,cuzza,2011-10-13 13:55:00,467,Another vote for Stabil here - I know it's not much oil but I doubt it'll do your catalytic converter any good and they're expensive if you do manage to poison it.
630498,Old Man,2011-10-13 14:10:00,822,"Bad for your converter and O2 sensors, don't do it. Replacement of these cost way more than saving 20 litres of gas. Dump some Marine grade Stabil in the tank and use it next year."
630499,Fisherman,2011-10-13 14:11:00,7201,"Put stabilizer in gas from July, it's already past its prime."
630550,saneryin,2011-10-13 17:31:00,39,"Thank you for all replies.  Maybe I should call Billy Bob LOL. He is a nice guy, had given me good suggestion before.  I will try to use it...I already have 2 bottle (10L/each) gas at the yard... not sure about the stabilize...because my engine is poor though.  so...before solid lake surface, what we can fish now is perch? I have read a lot post here.    "
630557,cuzza,2011-10-13 17:47:00,467, Your call - a catalytic converter is $200 and O2 sensors are $50 each as a minimum plus fitting which is a lot more than a bottle of Stabil!
630563,fishermccann,2011-10-13 17:52:00,655,"I use gas from  the last year all the time with no problems in my boats, without any stabiliser. The motors run fine with no missing, but then I am a regular user of Seafoam!"
630721,Fishnwire,2011-10-14 10:14:00,983,"Assuming your vehicle's tank is 60 litres and you put the unused gas in the next time you fill up...your looking at a 120:1 ratio of gas to oil.  Unless you drive an Indy car or similarly high-tuned machine, that small amount of oil one time will make no difference short or long term.  I'm not a professional but I've spoken on this very subject with several people who are.  ""It won't hurt nothin'"" is what I've been told."
630913,Tybo,2011-10-14 20:24:00,1373,We where talking about this at work. We figured the tcw3 is so low ashe now that it will not do any harm.
631070,GYPSY400,2011-10-15 07:19:00,191,"I do it all the time.. My truck, quad, lawnmower etc have all seen mixed gas and honestly I can't tell the difference performance wise."
