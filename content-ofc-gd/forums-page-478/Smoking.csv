631184,skinny,2011-10-15 18:25:00,442,Ok so as per my other post My brother and I built a smoker looks nice but not working very well. Issue was it wasn't creating smoke. we put the tray of chips in above the flame area but they didn't start to give off smoke until we actually lit the chips to burn. and the flame unit just kept the heat. I always thoght the flame would make the chips smolder. any of this sound familure to anyone out there that smokes.  looking for more info/how it works in yours
631185,GBW,2011-10-15 18:35:00,8460,"i put it in the fish's yap pre-light so there is not reason it can't get it going...  ohhh wait...  are you soaking your wood chips at all?  If not, you need to..."
631186,skinny,2011-10-15 18:38:00,442,my Brother was the guy that did the test run I will ask him if he did is it something like soak for an hour and then put them in the tray wet
631187,GBW,2011-10-15 18:39:00,8460,I soak my chips over night (1/2 the time the fish is in the brine) and yes I put them in damp.
631188,Rich,2011-10-15 18:42:00,3927,"Yea, definitely gotta soak the chips pretty good for best effect."
631192,skinny,2011-10-15 18:54:00,442,it seems the heat is not enough to make the chips smoke. I spoke to my brother he soaked the chips for the night and put them in damp
631194,Fisherman,2011-10-15 19:05:00,7201,"In 20 years of smoking, I've never soaked my chips, store bought or home made.  If you're using an electric heater, your chip pan is either too thick or not close enough to the heater.  My smoker has a 250 watt ""U"" shaped element that almost touches the bottom of the tin pan.  It takes about 1/2 hour for the element to really heat up red and then the chips will smoulder and make smoke.  They never ""burn"" outright.  Looking back at your photos of the smoker, if that's your chip pan, it needs to be a lot closer to the heater."
631195,GBW,2011-10-15 19:07:00,8460,gas or electric smoker?
631200,nuke,2011-10-15 19:16:00,60,"One part dry, two parts wet (I believe)."
631201,skinny,2011-10-15 19:27:00,442,the smoker is gas  my bro let the chips soak over night he put them in cabinet and watched for 2hr and no smoke cabinet temp reached 180 easily in that time  after aprox 2 hr he lit the chips with a torch to get them going and I think things were ok from then  how long should it take for smoke to start  I'm wondering if the flame is to large causing it to heat fast and stop thus not putting chips in heat long enough  I also think he mover the chip tray closer to flame several times it maybe sitting on top of flame guard now
631204,Fisherman,2011-10-15 19:51:00,7201,
631206,Roy,2011-10-15 20:02:00,13728,I didn't see any vents in there Skinny. Is that thing airtight? And Fisherman is right about the element. I usually soak my chips but just so they might last a little longer.
631229,skinny,2011-10-15 21:40:00,442,curently there is a bit of gap around door (not closed) we havn't cut a vent yet as it is easy to cut holes hard to fill them so we want to make sure things are right before getting carried away with holes how much vent you think is needed???
631234,Fisherman,2011-10-15 21:53:00,7201,"Maybe a 1 inch hole on each side at the top. It also functions to let out the vapour from drying the fish(or whatever else you're smoking).  Are you aware that propane also gives off a fair bit of vapour that will otherwise stay inside the smoker.  To cover the vents or make adjustments, you can use a small plastic baffle on a wingnut. The aluminum smoker I have has small crinkles in the joints at the top and also the front door has about a 1/8th gap all around for venting."
631237,skinny,2011-10-15 22:00:00,442,"it's not propane it's nat gas and we will start with 1"" holes I guess I also thing we are going to downsize the jet a fair bit to try and increase flame time"
631238,misfish,2011-10-15 22:00:00,29133, Theres yer problem. Just saying.
631251,Fisherman,2011-10-15 23:21:00,7201," Natural gas does the same as propane, just think about winter and all those chimneys giving off the vapour. You just don't see it in warmer weather because the vapour doesn't condense for the visual effect like it does in winter."
631376,pameladallaire,2011-10-16 15:21:00,470,"To smoke meat that has to be cooked at the same time, I just use my BBQ.  On one side I put lots of charcoal briquets.  When they are hot, I place on top, wet and dry mixed wood chips wrapped in double tin foil with holes in it.  On the other side of the BBQ on the top rack I put frozen, or really cold meat, and a drip pan below.  When the meat is cooked through, it looks like ham inside and tastes great.  I usually completely fill the one side of the BBQ with frozen roasts, sausage, and pork backs and take each out as they are cooked.  Sometimes I smoke jalapeno peppers above the meat.  Pam"
631399,GBW,2011-10-16 16:22:00,8460,"skinny, you need to tell us what you are seeing and doing rather then telling us what your brother thinks is going on.  If I'm going to smoke anything I plan to waste the day doing it so it's done right.  I made a wood box smoker before and it took forever to get hot and do the job.  But keep the wood chips as close to the flame/heat as you can for it to make smoke."
631457,bushart,2011-10-16 20:56:00,2628,I had a tin smoker for years and done lots of trout and salmon in it  Electric element---l'il frypan---never soaked my chips  I loved Hickory  Anyway I digress---My cuz had a fridge turned into a smoker---but the fire was lit of course in a box outside and piped into the box  Your call  There's hot smoked and cold smoked  My old tinny---would be a whole day and probably too many ales  Neighbors hangin outside waitin on that fresh smoked fish and a cold beer----dang I miss my smoker
631477,skinny,2011-10-16 22:55:00,442,well the first time going he did everything with out me around so I have to just relay what he did/saw. I don't think anything will be attempted again till next weekend and I'm hoping to be there to watch/report
631617,bubbles,2011-10-17 13:49:00,591,"I have not been smoking long, only done it a few times so I am learning every time. I soak my chips for a few hours, the thought is they will last a little longer, not sure that they do. I wrap my soaked chips in foil and poke holes in it to avoid them catching on fire and in hopes that they last longer. A package of chips seems to smoke for about an hour. Propane smoker.  Yesterday I smoked a prime rib (MMMMM), was very windy and a little cool outside, took about 45min - an hour at 240 for the chips to get smoking.  Your temp seems pretty low, maybe just some more patience.  I say have one more beer next time before you give up.  Just try again, and keep messing with it.  Smoking seems to be frustrating for a while but the food tastes fantastic so it's all worth it."
