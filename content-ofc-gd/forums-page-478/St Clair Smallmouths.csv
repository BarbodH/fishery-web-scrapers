Great numbers of quality fish are roaming the shallow weedlines and the weather has been amazing. Tubes, Spinnerbaits, Senkos, ""Fluffies"" and Jerkbaits are all working, with this weather they will prob remain shallow for awhile still. Heres a couple from yesterday "

630655,msp,2011-10-13 23:46:00,1336,"Some really nice fish there. May I ask what ""fluffies "" are?"
630699,cl_fishin,2011-10-14 02:17:00,138," Its actually called the St Clair Shiner jig but everyone just calls it the ""Fluffy jig"", its a small swim jig with a pearl mylar skirt and grub tail, deadly when the Smallies are chasing bait. Its very popular on waters with schooling baitfish like the Great Lakes, St Clair, and Simcoe too. "
630982,msp,2011-10-14 23:02:00,1336,"Nice , those look very cool. Im sure they will work on any water with smallies. Thanks for the info"
631283,Bob Devine,2011-10-16 01:17:00,251,"Nice fish Carl. St. Clair has been on fire for bass and muskies recently. With both numbers and size it is an awesome place to fish. Most outdoors people have left the fishing and picked up the hunting gear, leaving the lake with plenty of open water opportunties."
