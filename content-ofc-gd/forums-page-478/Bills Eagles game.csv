629856,registerfly,2011-10-11 21:52:00,198,Closet Bills fan since my HS days. Not like the Kelly days of course(which was heartbreaking) but the comebacks have been impressive. Here's to hoping they rack up a few more wins. And am I the only one here who thinks the Vick experiment is over?
630023,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 09:32:00,5865,"NICE PICS........better then what the local paper takes.  Photo #6 shows holding that the NFL no longer calls because this is now a passing, flag football league... ...don't hit the QB, don't hit the receiver, don't tackle from behind, etc.....  The Bills need to step it up on the defensive side of the ball....you can NOT allow the other team to gain 450+ yards each week and expect to win...when your defense takes away the ball 4 times in a game you should be winning by 21 points or more...not by one score....but they are what they are.....only problem the schedule now gets much tougher.  They have enjoyed a lot of good ball bounces.....hopefully the luck will continue.  GO Ralph Wilson and leave the Bills behind......"
