631249,alexmedic,2011-10-15 23:00:00,186,"Although I've never met you Cudz, I have to say, I'm glad that you never gave the sport up.  I also battle with the obsession to get out when ever I can, and with 2 same girls myself, and a wife that does not understand why I chase green slimy things around the water, I know it can be very demotivating to get out and feel the pressure of ""I gotta be home soon, or else""!  As the girls get older, I have come to realize that my fishing time will become less, time on the boat with them may be for boating and swimming (with 15 minutes of fishing or so put in the mix), but I have also realized that the fish will always be in the lake, and one day I'll have to beg them to spend some time with me...  From your posts, it is very apparent that you understand and love the sport and to drop it completely really would be a shame.  So welcome back and I look forward to the posts, (even if they are fewer than before)."
631268,Skipper D,2011-10-16 00:25:00,1970,Well put 1090...........
631295,Cudz,2011-10-16 03:04:00,2652, I wish I could say I was fishing but I am not.  I still check the site but I have not fished since I quit. I really do miss it especially with last weekend's weather but I have not been fishing since quitting.  I am still lurking around the board and am willing to help out a fellow angler with spots or baits.
631302,livinisfishin,2011-10-16 03:47:00,661, Good to see your still around!
631328,Skipper D,2011-10-16 11:34:00,1970,"Hot dog!!! Looks like a fishing day today for any one who wants to get out on Lake Simcoe , Barrie web cam looks good and so dose the windfinder . To bad i have to go up to Wasaga Beach and excavate a new water line in for a customer right now . BUT WHEN I GET BACK .... am going Fish'n .

631073,Skipper D,2011-10-15 10:32:00,1970,Sure would like to head out right now for a day of fishing on LS. The wind weather forcast dose'nt look like it might let us .... dam .
631074,Fisherman,2011-10-15 11:02:00,7201, BIG anchor time.
631075,lew,2011-10-15 11:03:00,12766,"The winds are gusty out there already Skip and I think their sposed to get stronger as the day goes on.  She'll be nasty on the big lake, me thinks."
631076,Roy,2011-10-15 11:15:00,13728,Winds on  Simcoe  don't look too pleasant at all but I'm sure that there are places one can find where it'll be a little calmer. Good luck wherever you go.
631077,Skipper D,2011-10-15 11:16:00,1970,"I keep watching Windfinder.com, looks like the only window we might have is tomorrow around noon , today would be big anchor day for sure FM , O 'well theres other things i can do , maybe head down to the city to Radioworld and pickup a new transducer , maybe head out to the shop and modify that Danforth , or maybe finish building the plastic Mininow trap til the lake says OK ITS TIME ..... lol ."
631078,Terry,2011-10-15 11:31:00,14456,yeah I will not be fishing today
631080,alexmedic,2011-10-15 12:06:00,186,Had another great day on Kemp yesterday.  No shortage of perch  I'd would put a special thanks out there to my 25lb anchor and bimini top though!!
631081,Skipper D,2011-10-15 12:07:00,1970,"Sorry Roy & Terry for not anwsering back right away , this old computer keeps shutting down when it feels like it , never now when its going to happen , some times one boot of the foot starts it back up other times it takes five , i'll be glad when the new note book gets here from Dell . Yes the fishing dose'nt look good out there today for some of us , If i knew how to fish for some thing other then perch  i could do like Roy mention ."
631082,Skipper D,2011-10-15 12:09:00,1970,  You should have come and picked me up there 1090.........lol .
631120,LeXXington,2011-10-15 14:14:00,1928,There are some super gust's right now. I think anyone going out in Simcoe today better stay close in.  Simcoe does not forgive.  Stay safe all.
631122,Skipper D,2011-10-15 14:25:00,1970,"Thank you for the info , good stuff"
631140,bucktail,2011-10-15 15:39:00,1857,One word...................................NO
631151,Skipper D,2011-10-15 16:07:00,1970,"Hey there Bucktail , hows it going , lousy day hu.........."
631159,misfish,2011-10-15 16:58:00,29133,"I drove by the bay at 10:30,  west wind,just a ripple.No big anchor required. And to my surprise,only 3 boats out there."
631171,bucktail,2011-10-15 17:35:00,1857,"Hey Skipper......... its one ugly day in Burlington, which sucks since I am dieing to do anyhing but sit in the house! The waves are only 3.5 meters on Erie, think Ill wait for another day!!   darren"
631181,Cudz,2011-10-15 18:06:00,2652,It is great out there.  Stay near beach.  It is perfect no waves with a strong west wind.  All the fish are close in anyway.
631182,fishindude,2011-10-15 18:09:00,220,Safe enough for a 15' canoe + trolling motor? Have always wanted to get out on the bay for some perchin'
631191,Familyfisherman,2011-10-15 18:52:00,188,"If you're launching at Barrie and staying right in the bay there's places to fish, if you're thinking you'll head out into the big lake you really shouldn't...50km winds and gusts up to 80km -- that's just dangerous in any boat.  Water's getting colder...why bother?"
631209,misfish,2011-10-15 20:15:00,29133,"There was lots of parking,for got to add."
631220,Jigs,2011-10-15 21:09:00,136,Lake St. Francis is looking might angry too. Kept me off the water today.
631226,Skipper D,2011-10-15 21:25:00,1970,"  But , but , but the big one's are out around the bend tho Cudz ....lol"
631230,Skipper D,2011-10-15 21:42:00,1970,  Sorry to hear you 'r suffering over that way too . This sucks
631231,bucktail,2011-10-15 21:43:00,1857,"Man everyone just be carefull this weekend if you fish, its not worth it"
631235,Skipper D,2011-10-15 21:57:00,1970,"We need a bit of bad weather to go thru with a bit of wet snow before indian summer can start , at lest thats the way it suppose to work . hope that was'nt it last week and it over ............."
631236,misfish,2011-10-15 21:58:00,29133,Cudz who?
