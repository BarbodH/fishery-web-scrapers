The new engines will be available at BRP dealerships in early 2012.  Clickto read more."
631260,scugpg,2011-10-15 23:52:00,1373,Are they going to be 4 strokes then? Very interesting.
631288,dhickey,2011-10-16 02:09:00,1038,I have herd good things about those engines. Concidering buying a 15hrs. Any one know who the parent company is ??(to tohatsu?)
631290,dave524,2011-10-16 02:22:00,4508,"I thought small Mercs were Tohatsu's too, looks like they'll have the market cornered"
631306,craigdritchie,2011-10-16 05:52:00,1586,"So far as I know Tohatsu is the parent company. They make all sorts of small engines - outboards included.  Scugog - it would appear that yes, they will be four-strokes.  Dave - Yup, they should be more or less identical to Mercury's small outboards, and of course, Tohatsu's own-branded engines.  The Johnson four-strokes that BRP used to sell were made by Suzuki.  Definitely interesting times.  In Vancouver tonight for a trade show that starts tomorrow. Wish I was fishing."
631326,scugpg,2011-10-16 11:12:00,1373,Tohatsu also makes the nissan line of small motors. Should make it easy for parts!
631346,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-10-16 12:38:00,1362,I love Tohatsu!!.....bought a new Tohatsu 40HP 2 stroke back in 1994 along with a 20' pontoon boat.....sold the boat and motor last year and the motor was as good as new!!  Upgraded to a 20' fishing boat and bought an 8HP 4 stroke Tohastu kicker last year....runs great and it was much cheaper $$$$$$$$$$ than any other motors out on the  market!!
