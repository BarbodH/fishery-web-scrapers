630653,Terry,2011-10-13 23:36:00,14456,LOL  and that is why it was a thing of beauty...LOL  man I was stuck for a while in that slush
630658,misfish,2011-10-14 00:17:00,29133,"  Maybe you should rethink bud.Blowing a path, might be better. Oh wait,they may follow.  Reminds me of a good  newfie joke.I followed the tracks and ,,,,,,,,,,,,      Never mind."
630703,dhickey,2011-10-14 02:51:00,1038,Quick tip..... Be safe play smart. # 1  float suit #2 GPS / CELL minnimum.. sleds are by far best on the hard water( carbides and studded is a MUST)  As far as cheap transportation an old air coolled is a safe bet.
630850,smally21,2011-10-14 17:29:00,993,"have you considered one of these? perfect to get the ice fishing crowd out to the island.....    it eats bicycles for fuel, and the occasional atv"
630868,Familyfisherman,2011-10-14 18:12:00,188,"Quite the party wagon...  You can walk to a few places on Simcoe, especially at first ice.  Bear Point, out around the hump between the 6th and 7th of Oro, etc.  The walk is a couple of kms.  However, the fish don't stay around those places long into the season.  The fish move, so you have to as well to stay catching them consistently.  A sled or ATV are both viable options, but do require an investment on your part.  That's part of it.  By far the bigger investment is in TIME -- to research, to spend time at it getting up to speed.  Ice fishing has its nuances just like open water fishing.  It takes a large investment on your part to changing fish on the screen to fish on the ice.  If you're serious about giving it a try, hook up with someone who has a 2up sled or ATV, an ice fish finder, a power auger, and knows what they're doing...then go quite a few times and give it a real chance.  To go out walking to a place where there isn't fish, without the proper equipment and little knowledge of what you're doing will result more often than not in a poor days fishing...you'll join the crowd and say Simcoe has no fish, and you'll think ice fishing sucks.  However, on the contrary, if you go with someone, a guide perhaps, who keeps you on fish, you'll have a blast and realize how much fun ice fishing can be.  The choice really is yours..."
630933,registerfly,2011-10-14 20:58:00,198,"Got the finder and all else needed from last season just the means to get out 3plus clicks out. that truck looks like an overgrown argos  This season I'm just looking for some bigger fish. Last year we had days of max fish per person, but not what I would consider eating worthy so back in it they went. Kinda lookig forward to the new season and see how we'll do.  thanks for all the replies  "
631367,Swedie,2011-10-16 14:26:00,8," That's a Swedish military vehicle, I have driven the 4 wheel version of it for a year when I did my military duty. It not the safest or reliable car but it doesn't stop for anything. I know there are a lot of them for sale back home."
629991,registerfly,2011-10-12 02:26:00,198,"okay, I'm cheap and not really sure if ice fishing is my cup of tea. Went out maybe 3-4 times last season with moderate success, mainly perch and not that many jumbos at Simcoe. before I invest anymore $ into something like a used atv/snowmobile to get out ""there"" to set up camp, wanted to know if it is really necessary to get out that far to fish? I know it depends where you fish and structure etc. but are there any businesses that provide transport service to and from general spots? And lastly, has anyone considered using their bike ie mountain bike with studded tires to pull their sled to their favourite spots? I know it sounds out there but I've got the tires and ride trails all winter long.  Got the hut on order and was able to find my favourite buddy heater so all set aside from the long walk out."
629999,Rod Caster,2011-10-12 02:54:00,5784,A german sheppard or husky would probably pull a portable hut with minimal effort.
630001,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-12 03:14:00,10439,It is not necessary to go out too far in most cases. I usually walk less than 2 miles one way on my trips. I hoof it on all my early season trips until the ice is safe for sled travel. I don't see why you couldn't use your bike as long as there is not much snow.
630027,Terry,2011-10-12 09:45:00,14456,"if simcoe is your target lake and you want to get to the best spots as the season progresses, then you need a snowmobile to keep on top of them also if you have all the toys and a hut. it sure makes it easier to move them  an 8hp icewalker might do the trick, but won't know till this winter"
630039,misfish,2011-10-12 10:42:00,29133," Sure hope it does,I hate walking."
630047,skinny,2011-10-12 11:03:00,442,what is a icewalker
630055,Fisherman,2011-10-12 11:37:00,7201," That may be okay for bare ice, but, wait til you get a foot of snow or 6+ inches of slush, you'll be cursing a blue streak or two."
630089,registerfly,2011-10-12 13:18:00,198,thanks for the info guys.  re: icewalker  http://www.theicewalker.com/  is this legal here and has anyone even tried this? Seems like it was patented  few years back with adjustments for retrieval.  doesn't sound like the one with the engine though...
630109,Terry,2011-10-12 15:00:00,14456,not the ice walker I was talking about guess meant Snow&Icewalker  details at first ice on cooks bay   
630126,adempsey,2011-10-12 16:06:00,1498,"I don't own any form of transportation with the exception of my two legs and a plastic sled to hold my gear.   I primarily fish Simcoe for whitefish/trout and typically have to walk out up to 3km to reach 80+ FOW.  Some years we do amazingly well, other years not as well as those that can travel much further out and quickly move to new locations.   So, you don't NEED the transportation to be successful by any means, but it's really NICE to have.  IMO, a floater suit and a sonar/flasher are far more important than an ATV/sled unless you have difficult making the trek on foot.  I've also considered some type of mountain bike, or a three wheel bike, with studded tires.   I don't see why it wouldn't work, but it would be tough going on some days."
630141,DOS,2011-10-12 16:40:00,119,"Depends where on Simcoe you go, I target mainly cooks bay from the Gilford side and it can be walked pretty easy.  They do run an Ice Taxi service there also but not sure what it costs. Quads are nice, sleds are better, but the best is friends with quads or sleds...LOL  RED"
630158,Terry,2011-10-12 18:15:00,14456,"the older I get and the more toys I get the harder it is to get all my toys out onto the ice  it's not the walk out because most times you walk out a bit and fish, then move out a bit farther, then farther and farther then you are done for the day and realize you have a 5 mile walk in with dragging a sled or hut.....having help sure is better then walking  3 miles out and a blizzard starts a quicl 3 minute ride in is better then a hour walk in, in a blizzard"
630160,Headhunter,2011-10-12 18:23:00,5703,"Or, you could do what I do and drive my truck out there. HH"
630187,registerfly,2011-10-12 19:26:00,198,"exactly what I am waiting for, my buddy to get a sled or quad. Not too gung ho about driving out there but would depend upon the launch locations.  I think this year I'll try towing with my commuter bike and get the feel for the conditions. Last year most of the days I went out there was little snow, only ice so that would be fine. It's the 6"" of fresh or loose stuff I really want to test out.  thanks"
630333,RickOnt,2011-10-13 00:30:00,669,"Hey Fly  The biggest challenge for the Mountain Bike is deep snow,  So!!  Your best travel time is Early season re First Ice little Snow or after a mid season thaw and Freeze.  Or give me a  PM, and if I am going out I will haul your butt out there!!  Rick"
630346,misfish,2011-10-13 01:00:00,29133,"     My vid of me an Chuck, are on my pooched drive. It was a blast."
630358,BillM,2011-10-13 01:17:00,17367,"Wait till the ice is thick and drive out.  I've had my truck 13-14 miles off of 9th line on multiple occasions.   Although now I have a sled, it's a lot more fun"
630367,registerfly,2011-10-13 01:36:00,198, That's a sweet offer Rick. I might make you regret it LOL. Yep the deep stuff is going to be the main challenge so will definitely be avoiding it at all costs. I figure the first couple times out will be hilarious. Then when it gets nice and thick the van will be the answer
630368,Rizzo,2011-10-13 01:40:00,4754,"I'm thinking the bike will be a nuisance on most days...having said that, I have nothing better to offer. I walk, but no more than 1 km each way. Last winter I found some perch spots close to shore that produced well so this year it won't even be a 1 km walk"
630519,registerfly,2011-10-13 15:44:00,198, I'm gonna fish with you Roger!!
630601,Rizzo,2011-10-13 20:28:00,4754," you're on! The first time I got out this past winter I did the 1 km walk because thats where all the huts were. Somebody told me try much closer to shore, forget the walk to the shantytown, and guess what, it worked! Because its a short walk I'm gonna fish in style. Got the hut, bought a Coleman this summer, gonna whip up some bacon/eggs and coffee while you drill the holes (don't worry, got the gas auger too). Only thing I don't have is a proper toboggan - see my avatar shot taken at the Simcoe GTG 7 or 8 years ago."
