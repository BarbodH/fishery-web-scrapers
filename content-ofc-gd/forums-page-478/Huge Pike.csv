631228,bucktail,2011-10-15 21:35:00,1857,Im going to post some trophy emerald shiners next week!! Maybe in a violin hold!!
631232,Miracon,2011-10-15 21:47:00,200,Thanks for the input Geoff! My little rant was cause I'd be thrilled to catch a fish even half that size and some didn't seem at all impressed! Haha! Plus...I'd had a few rum and cokes late on a Friday night and was more inclined to speak my mind!  I don't think anything could actually discourage me from this forum and all the awesome members here...I'm HOOKED! I just wanted to stick up for Dave's big fish and make sure my future little one's were welcome here!
631233,danbouck,2011-10-15 21:50:00,4380, Lol
631296,Cudz,2011-10-16 03:08:00,2652,Nope.  Still have not fished since quitting.  Just creeping around here from time to time.
631304,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-16 04:26:00,1107, thats like a herion addict snorting coke haha just teasin good to see ya still around even if your not phishin

631325,Handlebarz,2011-10-16 11:10:00,3790,"  Miracon don't get discouraged about posting your pictures here, in this thread most were joking about Dave as he would have it no other way.  I use P&S camera also and take pics best I can using the self timer some times they turn out and some times they don't kinda like the pics of my daughter and I last week it was so blurry but I posted it.  If some one is so truly upset about a picture because of the camera angle or distance that the fish is from there body and they are serious then they need a time out to get fishing as they are to fish deprived. The rest of the OFC family will point out that they are out of line just like in this thread.  Keep fishing and posting them up here you will see it takes a while for the family here to accept new people heck some still have not accepted me and I have been here longer then I can remember.  Now that your done reading this go get out fishing and bring back lots of pics."

630895,bucktail,2011-10-14 19:25:00,1857,I have to agree with Craig on this one. I really dont like that picture setup. If its a huge fish would dont have to make it look bigger. Some of the people on this board do some awesome creative pictures. First one that comes to mind is Dan and his brookies. I think the older you are and the more fish you catch the less interested you are to do this. Lew is perfect example he has caught so many nice fish he doesnt even take many pictures now unless its an extraordinary one.   Darren
630904,The Urban Fisherman,2011-10-14 19:56:00,2050,I think it's a great shot.. Heard the guy that took it is a really cool dude to!
630905,mistaredone,2011-10-14 20:07:00,913,I'll take the first guess of mid 40's but super FAT!!  Awesome fish but not a fan of the cheat

630910,GBW,2011-10-14 20:21:00,8460,Me too and....
630930,bubbles,2011-10-14 20:47:00,591,Great fish.  I look forward to the seminar on how to hold a fish to properly and keep everyone happy.
631016,Daplumma,2011-10-15 00:43:00,1961," Too funny Dan.I like the OP pic.Big happy dude holding a good sized fish,thats what its all about,right? For the record,the fish in my avatar was pulled from my parents aquarium and held real close to the camera."
631028,backbay,2011-10-15 01:20:00,773,"There you go, another reason to never throw ANYTHING away!"
631031,lovetofish,2011-10-15 01:35:00,500,Wow thats a beauty!  Any measurements?
631033,Handlebarz,2011-10-15 01:41:00,3790,Knowing Dave from the show and Ryan from here I would say that pic was done in fun it is cool and you can tell from the look in Dave's eyes he just wanted to let the fish go so he could grab the minnow bucket.
631036,Rizzo,2011-10-15 01:53:00,4754,"Man what a fish, congratulations.  Lew as I was reading that I'm thinking ""What the heck is he talking about"" Then I scrolled down, saw the picture, and spit coke all over the screen. Classic"
631048,GBW,2011-10-15 02:50:00,8460,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
631058,Jen,2011-10-15 03:40:00,833,Great catch definately...  If I am holding a fish away from me like that it is usually so I don't get all slimmy. No one mentioned that part!
631066,Miracon,2011-10-15 05:24:00,200,"As a newbie here...I just want to add my unbiased opinion!  Held further away from the body...close to the body...regular lens...fish eye lens...whatever! It's still a big freakin' fish! Especially to a newbie here whose PB is a 12"" Perch!  When I joined this forum and knew any pics of mine (at least for the next few years) would pale in comparison to the more advanced anglers here, I still felt excited to post my future experiences with pride!  BUT...when I read this thread and went from ""WOW what an awesome fish!"" to reading everyone complaining about how the pic was taken, I thought...this is way out of MY league! And now I will feel I will never measure up so ...why bother.   The complaints have seriously discouraged me from wanting to post any future pics of my journey into this hobby for fear they aren't ""technically"" correct. I won't ever have a qualified ""photographer"" on board. At most, I'll have a P&S camera with an amateur behind it. And the angle may never be quite right...and I definitely might not know how to correctly hold the fish yet!  So...my question then is...  Is this forum THAT serious about the guidelines of the pictures taken...that simply taking pride in a shared interest and posting fun pics to excite all AND make all newbies want to take part in the sport not acceptable?! I certainly did not get that impression from the awesome members here so am a little surprised by this thread!"
631069,zamboniwaterboy,2011-10-15 06:32:00,126,Miracon Just keep on posting your pics.  If you are proud of your accomplishments brag!  As far as the pike posted at the top great catch and the pic looks awesome!   
631083,GBW,2011-10-15 12:14:00,8460,"Miracon, don't worry about the comments as nothing will ever be perfect.  Dave (the guy in the pic) has a show and is an emcee for a major bass tour so some times people take shots when they can.  Ryan (theurbanfisher) works for Dave and took the pic hence his reply.  I found the pic via twitter or facebook and posted it cause it is a very nice fish and a cool pic, so why not share...  Post your progress and pic's and you will have the full support of everyone here (just look at Dana! ).  the odd time someone will poke fun at you (I get it all the time! so does CCMT, HAHAHA) or tell you that you held the fish wrong but don't worry about it.  poke fun back and learn from the past to do it right the next time.  Just enjoy...  Geoff"
631095,bigcreekdad,2011-10-15 13:06:00,546,  That pic of the guy with the monster pike has been posted in various places on the net for many years. Every time it pops up it's caught on a different lake just recently. I believe it was actually caught somewhere in Europe.
631105,GBW,2011-10-15 13:30:00,8460,Roy was just messing with everyone for that very reason...
631146,Moosebunk,2011-10-15 15:55:00,3970,"Hard to know for sure...?  I think this photo is cool, and, would like to see another as well that better represents the fishes realism... (even if it was another with similar EAP but just backed off from the fish and angler)  Got some photos here of pike at 42-43 inches that look bigger than the ones taken of 46-47 inchers.  With the angle this photo was taken those same 42-43's could look like 50's no problem.  Great fish nonetheless for Dave.  Girth is a given, but length... really could be anywhere from 40-50.  One thing about all Tobin pike I've seen posted online, is they are some of the slobbiest fish to be found anywhere.  It's OK to play with camera angles and poses with the catch, just as it's OK to fine tune photos within the modern day darkrooms we now call photoshops.  Dave's catch, Dave's picture, Dave's memory, Dave's life, Dave's choice.  This photo of Dave's catch from ""Tobin,"" tells me he's doing something right.  Great catch and photo.  That grin says alot more about the moment than anything or anyone else."
631161,danbouck,2011-10-15 17:00:00,4380," No, my friend told me that his friend caught it"
631163,Rod Caster,2011-10-15 17:05:00,5784,Great fish Dave! Very impressive. If you hold it out just a little further you could use it to slap a few people.
631165,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-15 17:11:00,1107, and I wish they would quit photoshoping my face out I'm WAY better looking than that guy LOL  WHO really cares anyways it's obvious some people are really jelous of that fish and wish Dave would hold them like that LOL my spelling and comments are meant to be terrible just like the comments in this thread .Hey Dave mabye next time you can hold your big pike like a guitar
630753,GBW,2011-10-14 13:27:00,8460,caught on Tobin Lake in Saskatchewan.  
630754,craigdritchie,2011-10-14 13:33:00,1586,"Nice fish, so there's really no need to hold it a mile out and use such a wide angle lens that it distorts the image.  Why do people insist on doing that?"
630758,danbouck,2011-10-14 13:35:00,4380,because it looks nice
630761,GBW,2011-10-14 13:42:00,8460,"maybe the two belly's combined he had to? Sorry Dave, I had to..."
630766,craigdritchie,2011-10-14 13:51:00,1586,"Ha!  Maybe that's the reason.  I dunno, you see so many pictures where people hold the fish way out in front to try and make it look bigger. Makes me wonder why they have to do that. Is it not big enough? And do they really think they're fooling anyone?  Too bad, because Dave's pike really does look like a nice fish. I wish I could see what it really looked like.  I've always preferred more natural pictures. Both the fish and the angler look better.  Just my humble two cents'."

630777,lew,2011-10-14 14:31:00,12766," It can work in reverse though too Craig.  If you catch a monster fish and accidentely hold it too close to your body  you can actually make your 6 foot long, 50 pound fish appear to be small  "
630778,Remastered,2011-10-14 14:41:00,143,Awesome fishies. But how about some measurements since he's holding it so close
630781,ccmtcanada,2011-10-14 14:50:00,7971, THAT made me laugh Lew!!!
630783,mercman,2011-10-14 14:58:00,7054, Thats comical Lew !!! You must be 18 feet tall.
630784,Harrison,2011-10-14 15:03:00,2202,"Hope I am not alone, but I ducked twice reading this thread.  I think it is a cool shot.  Lew... beautie! ha."

630806,danbouck,2011-10-14 15:54:00,4380, I heard that was caught in Long Point Bay 2 months ago
630812,Roy,2011-10-14 16:01:00,13728, It sure was Dan. On 8lb mono. Can you believe that? The dude was apparently targeting walleyes.
