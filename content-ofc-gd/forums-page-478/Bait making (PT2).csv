630932,GBW,2011-10-14 20:49:00,8460,"Roy got me thinking and I did ask in his post bout I would rather not derail his.  So, does anyone here make soft plastic baits?  I would like to clone the 5"" grub I buy now and make my own but be able to tweak the colours and so forth a bit from here and there.      So, I'm asking if anyone can show us all some tricks, tips and products?  I would like to even figure out a good and easy to use low $$ mold to make/use that is easy and WORKS.  No, I don't want to mess around with plaster but if it's the last resort I guess I will have to (buy more baits then)"

630983,Dutch,2011-10-14 23:04:00,831,"I looked into making my own plastics about a year or so ago.  I found out it is really a labour of love and won't save you a lot of cash up front after buying your supplies, but maybe a bit over the long term.  The best molds are cast aluminum and you can get them on the net or have them made custom.  Some other people use silicone molds that are home-made that also work well and are a lot cheaper.  Thing that really turned me off was the heating of the plastic - need a microwave and you have to be VERY careful as it has to get up to about 300 degrees+.  You need to wear glasses and gloves at a minimum.  Also, everything has to be absolutely dry as any water will boil instantly and could cause a blow-up.  Also, it stinks to high heaven, so you have to do it in the garage or a shed somewhere.  I don't mean to turn you off, but just want to make sure you are aware of what you are getting into."

631045,GBW,2011-10-15 02:42:00,8460,at least the bait was never shown...
631046,GBW,2011-10-15 02:45:00,8460,"PS Adam, your last order went missing... find anything in Shanghai to use?"
631086,GBW,2011-10-15 12:21:00,8460,how did you know that was the name of the pattern anyway?!?!
631087,GBW,2011-10-15 12:23:00,8460,Thanks and yeah I do know how bad it can be.  I would rather use a hotplate then the microwave and do it all in the garage.  I do have a TV and radio in there too so it's not that bad out there...
