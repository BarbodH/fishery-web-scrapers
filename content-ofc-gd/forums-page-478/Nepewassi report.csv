My Aunt offered us her Cottage on Lk Nepewassi for Thanksgiving W/E I gladly accepted   .. since my Sister owns the Cottage next to hers.. it was a Bonus!  I showed up on Saturday and had a few beers.. I decided to head out for some Musky with my wife...  3rd cast with a 10"" Bumblebee Believer I got buzzed by a 50'+....   figure 8.. backup rod w/8"" BIG-O Twister...  then to a 10"" Spinnerbait .... and WHOOSH!  Bugger buzzed me again... Never bit , I spent 30 minutes on her and never seen her again.   ......... bla bla bla Sunday...   I took Megan out she's my 8 yr old .     I set her up with a 3/8Oz. Fireball/ Red Dace...   first drift she says ""Dad, J'en ai un"" and sets the hook................. BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..............  Low and behold ... an HUGE 50+"" Ski breaks the surface ...   I chase her down with the trolling motor ... and get within 10' and the line snaps...  Megan wasn't impressed ...   .......................  I returned for Walleye with Sue for a bit and on her first cast she says ""Ostie, Je l'ai manquer""   and then ZZZING!!... she didn'nt miss it , her P/B was swimming UP....  I grabbed the net and ... My Wife's PB Walleye 26.5"" and 6.4Oz on a Rapala scale...    After bringing Sue and her Walleye to camp .. I set out for an evenin' bite...  I reeled in a few Rock Bass..  a couple of Tiny Smallies ..... 2 x 12-15"" Walleye and a pretty nice one @ 25 3/4 ""     Best Thanksgiving EVER!!!!   Randy "
