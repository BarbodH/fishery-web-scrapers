Temperatures in the mid- to high-20′s and pure and unobstructed sun made it feel like summer once again. Digging out the shorts and sandals in honour of this one last hurrah sure felt fulfilling.  I had the pleasure of sharing the boat with Ashley Rae of http://SheLovesToFish.com on Monday. Not only is this woman an accomplished angler in her own right  and a breath of fresh air for the fishing industry  but she is also one of the most down-to-earth and friendly people you could meet. Regardless of the fishing action, I knew we were in for a fun day on the water.  October 10  I made the drive down to Kingston to meet up with Ashley early this morning. After a quick introduction and a stop for gas, we headed northward to a favourite lake of hers. Arriving at the launch some twenty minutes later, we are joined at the ramp by Dale Minicola, CEO and President of http://marinecentral.ca. Behind his tow vehicle was the Charger bass boats he carries. I gazed over with a slight hint of envy!  After a few quick words and well-wishes, we set off in our prospective boats in search of some fish tales. Ashley and I take a short ride up the lake and stop at a point. Working out from it in the ultra-clear water, we begin tossing baits in the 8- to 15-foot depth range. It doesnt take long for Ashley to connect with the first one of the day on her drop-shot rig.
