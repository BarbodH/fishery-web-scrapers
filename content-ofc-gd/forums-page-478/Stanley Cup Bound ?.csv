631064,manitoubass2,2011-10-15 04:39:00,11391," Yes, but hopefully its not one series against the Sens, my god.   "
631090,Jer,2011-10-15 12:31:00,1426,  From the look of the Sens so far...I don't think that'll be a problem...
631091,Rizzo,2011-10-15 12:36:00,4754,"but if it is, its a series they might actually win. Unfortunately for Leafs fans there is no playoff series for the 26th team vs the 29th team. No playoffs for either Leafs or Sens would be my guess, but if anyone sneaks in at 8 I'd guess the Leafs have a better shot"
631099,Ralph Field,2011-10-15 13:11:00,1018,"Leaf fans have got to be the most stubborn fans alive , they are disappointed year after year but keep the faith."
631102,grimsbylander,2011-10-15 13:13:00,3016,Reimer is playing great again this year but that might not be a good thing! It seems that any time the Leafs get a great goalie they stop shopping for better guys to play in front of him. I hope Burke is the exception. Go leafs!
631137,tb4me,2011-10-15 15:07:00,3295,"This year....Cup no , Play-offs yes indeed!!!!"
631291,dhickey,2011-10-16 02:41:00,1038,Im going out on a HUGE limb here Beloved Maple Leafs go to semi finals.  Razz me in feburary?  SALTYDAWG   (Oh God help me)
631387,Jds63,2011-10-16 15:47:00,1365,Oh yeah ... Reimer held them in the game again last night for the win ....
631425,tb4me,2011-10-16 18:28:00,3295,was a great game!!! Kessel sits at the top of the NHL in scoring and points baby!!!! This is going to be a good year to be a Leaf fan
631459,Jds63,2011-10-16 21:02:00,1365,"It sures is nice to see Kessel scoring , just hope he stays healthy, more than likely there will be a low point but for now it looks promising"
631476,craigdritchie,2011-10-16 22:54:00,1586,where or where is Johnny Bass?
631488,Cookslav,2011-10-16 23:48:00,1457,"  I'd agree that statement. The leafs actually looked pretty good last year outside of a gaping hole mid season...fantastic start, and a great run at the end. It was their prolonged slump that sunk them. Moving forward the only real question of any concern is did they figure out the chemistry.... Last year they started ridiculously hot, but when the rest of the league warmed up the Leafs shut down and couldn't break out of their slump. They got frustration and forgot how to play like a ""TEAM"". Every game was like watching a bloody try out....single efforts, hot dogging and selfish play. That goes nowhere when you play in the big leagues, espeicially when you are more or less a one trick pony....the phrase ""shadow Kessle"" comes to mind  Anyway, If this team has actually gelled, and Wilson has found a way to keep them calm and positive(which is got to be a rarity for Wilson) then we have a chance....but as its been said already lets see what transpires between now and Christmas before we get planning any parades."
631612,jbailey,2011-10-17 13:37:00,866,"well they better make the playoffs, or atleast hope florida doesnt! They're the only 2 teams that havent made the playoffs since the lockout! ahah"
628608,Jds63,2011-10-07 13:02:00,1365,"I know , I know  .... the Leafs nation is now full of optimism , but it still feels good to get a shutout against the Habs  could Optimus Reim be the real deal ??? ,,,, all we have is hope"
628619,Oryx,2011-10-07 13:31:00,186,"  Reim is the real deal.  I am a HUGE Leafs fan but my oppinion is not based on the usual Bull that goes with the start of every season.  Reim's background speaks volumes on his play.  I have never seen such an elite athlete so grounded.  He was the best goalie in last years ttraining camp, proved his worth with last years second half performance,  20 - 8 - 2.  and is picking up where he left off.  The difference this year he has a more cohesive defence in front of him.   (Pic was taken from Brian Burkes private box.  Thank you A.M.640 for the thrill of a lifetime) "
628626,Rod Caster,2011-10-07 13:44:00,5784,Let's see how they play against an NHL caliber team
628628,cjgraham,2011-10-07 13:55:00,104,"Great first game. A little shaky in the first period, but I liked how Remier really settled in. I'm hoping Deon can play like that every game too. and Steckel!!! what an addition!!!  "
628629,bassmaster4,2011-10-07 14:02:00,801,"i was pulling my hair out during the first thinking here we go again but they really turned it around in the 2nd and 3rd despite being outshot 30-18 reimer stole this one(although we didnt play too bad at all), but hey im sure any leaf fan will take it. Unlike other years i have a renewed optimism about this season not thinking their gonna win the cup, hoping for a playoff berth finally though, that would sure be nice. GO LEAFS GO!"
628633,addy79,2011-10-07 14:27:00,573,"UGH...  I bleed blue, but must admit, the habs played awful hockey last night."
628634,solopaddler,2011-10-07 14:34:00,8605,"Reimer sure looked good. Lombardi and especially Steckel were big surprises as well.  Say what you want about Burke, but right now Franson and a healthy Lombardi for Lebda and a minor league forward is just ridiculously one sided.  Not getting overly excited though, weren't they 4-1 or something like that to start last year? LOL!"
628636,GBW,2011-10-07 14:44:00,8460,"that's it, I'm growing my playoff beard now!"
628671,craigdritchie,2011-10-07 16:36:00,1586,"Ah yes, time for the annual Leafs discussion.  I will bravely say it right now - they will not make the playoffs, and will finish between 25th and 30th place.  Again.  Let the games begin!  :-)"
628672,Rizzo,2011-10-07 16:39:00,4754,Don Cherry was particularly prickly too!
628678,uglyfish,2011-10-07 16:46:00,981,"It wasn't that montreal play awful. The leafs just played that much better periods 2 and 3. They all skated, back checked, blocked shots, moved the puck well, and defensive zone coverage was excellant. Lots of hitting too! Komisarek played his best game as a leaf last nite. Should have been one of the 3 stars."
628680,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-07 16:54:00,2690,"I refuse to comment on any Leafs threads until Christmas  Okay, one comment  Really like Reimer, great kid with a ton of pressure on him...hope he succeeds."
628690,Jds63,2011-10-07 17:11:00,1365," really like Reimer as well, ... lets hope he doesn't fall to the Leafs starting goaltender wasteland ....  I don't agree with Don cherry calling out those 3 fighters as ""pukes"" ,, thats ignorant  I know its early but ""Its the most wonderful time of year"","
628691,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-07 17:14:00,4399,This could be a long year!!!
628719,Roy,2011-10-07 19:03:00,13728,"Don't worry about it Gord. It's the same thing every year. Kinda like teaching grade school..every September, a new batch of kids show up and you have 6-7 years to teach them that there are no miracles. BTW, it was an early spring which explains why it's started 2 weeks earlier than usual. Let's hope it's an early FALL. <---- pun"
628761,camillj,2011-10-07 22:33:00,1988,Tabernack Roy  I was just getting the sea-foam out for the shredding machines ... so we'd have plenty of confetti on hand for the parade
628860,Billy Bob,2011-10-08 10:42:00,5865,Sit back and enjoy.......because it's . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ............MILLER TIME  GO SABRES
628883,Dave Bailey,2011-10-08 14:18:00,1641," ? They were outshot 32 to 18. To me that means the defence isn't that great. And it's been a pattern for quite a few years. Even in games they have won with big scores they have still been outshot, meaning that their goalie is nothing but a puck target. They had better hope that if Reimer goes down with an injury any back-up is just as good. I know that in hockey as in any other sport the most important statistic is the final score of the game, but shots on goal tells you a lot about how your defence is, and 32-18 doesn't look good to me. It's only one game, but I'm not holding my breath."
628949,fishinguypat,2011-10-08 18:49:00,547,I don't care if they win their first 5 games they still suck... oh wait last year?
629043,uglyfish,2011-10-09 00:46:00,981," Actually, the past couple seasons they have outshot their opponent in most of the games.  And shots against don't necessarily mean bad defense. Most of those 32 shots, were poor quality shots. Its scoring chances, not shots that are a more telling stat."
629066,Grimace,2011-10-09 01:48:00,2020,"  Indeed.  Frustrated teams take many shots from low percentage areas because the shot are easy to take.   Shot selection is key.   Wilson was quoted many times over the last few years saying ""I think we made the other goalie look good tonight""."
629069,misfish,2011-10-09 01:54:00,29133,"They won again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
629070,d_paluch,2011-10-09 02:03:00,343,"haha,  can't win a cup with a game like that. But still....Go Leafs Go!"
629385,Woodsman,2011-10-10 15:00:00,1286,"""Stanley Cup Bound ?""  :rofl2:  Only if you can find a time machine to transport us back to 67."
631060,RobbieTheM,2011-10-15 03:42:00,35, So true.... but we can all only hope for just one playoff series. I miss getting excited about a hockey game that means something!
