631431,Fisherman,2011-10-16 19:08:00,7201,"I made my own from a 5 gallon pail, cut the upper rim off with the handle and left the ridges on.  Got out the sewing machine, about 4feet long by 3 foot wide piece of nylon material and sewed it to make a cone shaped tube. The small end is about 6"" open the upper has a hem sewn in with 550 cord inside.  Slide the big end over the ridges on the pail, tighten it up and there's your bag.  Slowed the boat right down to 1.5mph and it keeps the boat running straight when only using one downrigger."

631455,Terry,2011-10-16 20:52:00,14456,I tried the link and some do work but most of them are archived web pages...meaning no long there  have you heard of anyone buying them recently
631460,wkrp,2011-10-16 21:12:00,656,No. I thought someone on the board might have some info. A lot of the US walleye forums talk about them.
631471,Terry,2011-10-16 22:20:00,14456,I read a couple of forums and people said they contacted them but no reply  if you can find a phone number that would be the best way to find out
631484,spincast,2011-10-16 23:17:00,3279,They advertise in Great Lakes Angler all the time. www.glangler.com I have a Buggy Bag from them. Got it from a guy who was liquidatiting his store  on his recommendation-- Its a tad  oversized for my boat - as in when I use it I have to throttle up a fair bit to use it. It is a very sturdy product.
