630215,Duckie,2011-10-12 21:15:00,305,thought I would share a pic of this monster I landed last week.  I froze my butt off but it was so worth it! 
630218,mistaredone,2011-10-12 21:22:00,913,Nice fish.  I put the boat in the water for an hour on Sunday at Bronte.  I was looking for pike but all a saw were bass around the pier and one massive bull head.  Good to see you had better luck than I did
630230,lilkynan,2011-10-12 21:52:00,173,Great spot - even named my Daughter after Bronte - well phonetically correct for an East Mountain Hammer Boy - Bronny
