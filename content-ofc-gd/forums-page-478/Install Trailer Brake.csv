630965,smally21,2011-10-14 22:18:00,993,"forget the disc brake idea. im only saying that cause i never embraced it. to me the industrial nature of the application doesn't fit disc brakes, but i could stand corrected here. ive never put disc brakes on a trailer. i talked people out of it but it could be because i didn't know enough about it to come across as an absolute know it all, a feature i felt very important when dealing with customers.  the PA axles aren't the same quality as alot of the dexters out there, but sometimes they actually sell dexters so the argument goes phht.  the electric braked axle @ 220 from PA is a very good price. the problem is the spring center is what it is, no custom sizes.  i know nothing of excalibur prices. just they are local to the TO set.  cerka will sell over the counter. the discount they give after buying a few hundred sets of axles was staggering. but there over the counter prices are very, very competitive. i have priced lights at 40$ each they are 9$/pair at cerka. they are not a retail outlet like princess,  but they do over the counter sales. do yourself a favor have all your measurements and stuff ready when you call. they have a website now.  i think that 750 is a reasonable price for a guy to crawl around your trailer for 3-4 hrs, and sell you a few hundred in parts. it kinda hurts to think its about 30-40% the value of the trailer to add a couple of brake drums though.  if cost is a big issue go electric buy the brakes and drums and DIY it. its gonna run you a couple hundred smackers but if you want them...."
630968,Terry,2011-10-14 22:23:00,14456, the places I checked it was $412.00 for parts to do it myself
630970,smally21,2011-10-14 22:31:00,993,"welll for example cerka is 45 for the brake, vs 80, i havent priced the whole job or anything.  i already have brakes."
630978,Terry,2011-10-14 22:53:00,14456,"yeah I was not clicking enough times to see thier prices there  7'*1.25' LH ELECTRIC BRAKE DEXTER 	Retail $65.61  7'*1.25' RH ELECTRIC BRAKE DEXTER 	Retail $65.61  '5 ON 4.50' BC 7' H-D CUPS ONLY DEXTER ELE BRK Retail	2x $45.90  '7/16 BOLT KIT FOR PAIR OF 10' DEXTER ELE & HYD BR 	Retail $2.75   wiring kit 	25 bucks  1.980"" ID Wheel Bearing Set 	$15  300 bucks that is better for sure"
630981,Fisherman,2011-10-14 23:01:00,7201,"Heck if his present axle has the 4 hole backing plate, he should buy the PA axle, strip the required parts off it and put them on his axle that's under his trailer at a really good price."
630985,Terry,2011-10-14 23:07:00,14456, but I don't think it has brakes just the hubs unless I read it wrong
631027,Fisherman,2011-10-15 01:16:00,7201,"On your present axle, look behind the hubs and see if there are square plates with 4 holes welded to the axle, that's what the electric brake parts get bolted to.  If not, then you need the plates welded to the axle and the whole rest of the kit and kaboodle."
631029,Terry,2011-10-15 01:21:00,14456,I will check thanks
631072,Billy Bob,2011-10-15 08:56:00,5865,Get a bigger truck.....brake problem solved....
630127,ra95,2011-10-12 16:09:00,49,"To be safe on the road, I plan to install the brake onto the shorelandr trailer (SLB30BAL Basic model). Anyone knows: 1. Where can I get the brake installed? 2. Any experenice to share with me? 3. What should I be aware of and be careful of?  Thanks in advance on any opinions and information."
630129,Fisherman,2011-10-12 16:11:00,7201,"First of all it helps to know what area you're in, I'm sure someone could recommend a dealer in Halifax.."
630150,craigdritchie,2011-10-12 17:41:00,1586,How heavy is your boat/engine/trailer combination?  And what are you towing it with?
630184,smally21,2011-10-12 19:21:00,993,"legal requirement for brakes is loads in excess of 3000lbs.  i find the easiest/cost effective method is to switch out the entire axle assembly. or you can just change the hubs.  either way --  for electric you just swap out the idler axle for a braked axle and wire it up. same coupling. pretty inexpensive if your vehicle is already wired for brakes.  for hydraulic you put on a surge brake coupling in place of your existing coupling, and swap the idler for the braked axle. then you run a piping kit from the coupler to the brake drum, then across to the other drum. bleed the brakes and you are done. this is the more expensive option but then you dont have to add the electric brake controller.  parts cost depending on your choice of axle/hub replacement will be between 150-450. takes between 2-3 hours.  if you are local to milton there is a great distribuor there.  ive installed hundreds of braked axles if you want to pm me i can fill you in...this is a do it yourself job with a socker set and a car jack...  and what you are towing it with really doesn't matter to me."
630190,ra95,2011-10-12 19:41:00,49,"... A Ford Escape 3.0L 4WD, towing a Shorelandr with 17' boat with 115 engine, total is 2450lb including trailer. So it is less than 3000lb.  But my concern is that it is always nice to have a brake.  GTA area ..."
630492,wallyboss,2011-10-13 13:46:00,1095,My boat is lighter than yours and I have always been iffy about the Escape's brakes. I replaced my Escape so I do not have that problem anymore. I have a Princecraft Pro165 with a 75-4stroke. Any heavier and I would've added brakes on the trailer.
630500,smally21,2011-10-13 14:19:00,993,"trailer brakes can only improve your safety and ride quality. not to mention lengthen the lifespan of your expensive vehicle brakes by beating on your cheap trailer brakes...  if you travel alot with your trailer every state and province will have different regs, so adding brakes might get you closer to complicance...  IMO opinion any trailer built with a 3500lb axle should come equipped with brakes, if you are able to load it above the legal limit you probably will!!!at some point.  kinda like a customer with a super light 30' boat only wants a single 3500lb axle. sure its legal and works in his application but some yahoo could put a 30' twin engine cruiser on it.."
630635,Billy Bob,2011-10-13 22:51:00,5865,Change your front brakes on the Ford Escape to Carbon Metallic pads and you might as well change out the rotors also while your at it. Carbon Metallic pads will greatly increase stopping power and should be enough depending on home much weight you are stopping...unless I missed it you didn't mention total towing weight. Ceramic are cleaner but Carbon is much better for stopping.  ALSO....(very important) drain and fill your tranny fluid every other oil change...if done this way there is no need to completely drain/flush system...1 gallon of new tranny fluid is what you will be required to do this job......Ford Escape's have delicate trannies.   Bob
630639,Skipper D,2011-10-13 23:02:00,1970,"Some thing a bet cheaper , take a look at the axle just behind the hub , if you see a square plate with four holes in it welded to the axle tube you can  buy the brake assemblies that come with the backing plates that will bolt to the plates i mention ."
630690,ra95,2011-10-14 01:50:00,49,"During research, I also found many resource believe electric brake is not a valid option for boat trailer which is supposed to submerge at ramp."
630734,smally21,2011-10-14 12:11:00,993,"and gum stays in your stomach for seven years.....ive heard it lots of times and to be fair i built 100 surge brake boat trailers for every electric brake boat trailer. it is more traditional for utility, landscape applications. consider that trip down the highway in a pounding rainstorm, lights and brakes are as wet as they are gonna be with high pressure water getting everywhere..  the signal coming from your vehicle for lighting and braking is, in the bigger picture, negligilbe. im not going to say it can't happen but ive been up and down the boat ramp 50 million times with plugged in lighting and electric brakes, never been a problem.  in my experience electrical equip. that behaves improperly when wet or submerged already has some other problem, poor connection, wire almost grounded, etc.  at the end of the day however, my boat trailer would have surge brakes...  some of my more demanding customers (ontario hydro, opp, parks canada, toronto fire, etc.) wouldn't consider electric brakes so i guess i wouldn't either.."
630735,lew,2011-10-14 12:20:00,12766, Surge brakes on my boat trailer too & their excellent !!
630743,smally21,2011-10-14 12:53:00,993,a little off topic but a funny thing about electric brakes...  so a common error when wiring a 7pin plug with the diagram in front of you is are you looking at the rear of the plug or the front of the plug. if you make the simple mistake of thinking the wiring view is from the front you would wire the 7pin completely backwards.  the end result is the brake signal from your brake controller (reduced signal) is now the left turn signal (100% power application)  so i build a 38 foot tri axle with 21000lbs of carrying capacity with six of the biggest brakes you can find. take her out for a test drive and of course at some point put on my left turn signal.  you will never understand the awesome braking power of your trailer until you try this. when the blue smoke cleared i had broken all records for 100km/hr to zero stopping distance.
630762,craigdritchie,2011-10-14 13:44:00,1586,"Thousands upon thousands of boat trailers have electric brakes, and work with no problems whatsoever.  Smally's advice on swapping out the axles is bang-on. If you want to go the factory route for parts, Shoreland'r is handled by Do-It Industries, in Bolton, Ontario (800-842-9666).  If you're not comfortable doing the mechanical work yourself, pretty much any auto garage, marina or boat dealer can do it for you. A marina or boat dealer would be best, as an auto garage won't be set up to get the boat off the trailer if needed."

630864,ra95,2011-10-14 18:10:00,49,:wallbash:  I hate internet. It provides good information but it often overwhelms!  Disk Brake or Drum is another decision to make. Disk is said no good for boat trailer which is light(<3000#) and idled often so that Rotor rustness dooms.  But now you guys told me even electric has to be an option  Maybe I cannot decide till I take a university master degree on all knowledge about a small boat trail braking theory?
