617336,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-08-31 11:10:00,1362,"As some of you know from an earlier post, I had to cancel our trip down to Nantucket for Bluefin Tuna because of Hurricane Irene   ....it was actually a good decision because they had closed the Providence Rhode Island airport on Sunday and I would not have made it down in time to get on the boat yesterday...  So I puttered around the house and completed some outside chores which gave me the green light to head out on the river for a couple of hours last night before it got dark....I can't believe how short the days are getting!!......water temp dropped 5 degrees from last weekend with these cooler nights....  They're starting to fatten' up....  "
