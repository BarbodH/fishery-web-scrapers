I like the one that says ""Muskie- Picture a Northern Pike with jailhouse tats and a sawed off 12 guage"".    Funny Fishing Shirts"

617604,Nipfisher,2011-09-01 01:06:00,2449,Yep that one is good too.
617616,NAW,2011-09-01 01:26:00,4022,My wife keeps asking me for a gift list for my up-coming birthday.  I'm going to forward her that link.  I think I know which one she's going to pick.  Thanks Blair!
