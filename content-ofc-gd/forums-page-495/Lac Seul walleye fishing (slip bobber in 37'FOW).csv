The first couple hours produced the usual suspects of 20"" to 24"" fish with some keepers and even lost what was probably my biggest ever SMbass..oh well.  After that i tried deep but the majority of the fish were small. Despite the size the fishing was non stop...even in 37'FOW it was a bite a cast. Because of this i started experimenting and messing around with baits etc...slip bobbers, twister tails(i never use them) and even four inch white tube jigs inspired by a smelt a walleye coughed up all worked. Slip bobbering in nearly 40 feet of water was funny.  Jigs with minnows, leeches, suckers and nightcrawlers all work...so did combinations. A good lazy , hot day on Lac Seul...just what the doctor ordered!

616463,Rod Caster,2011-08-28 17:42:00,5784,Nice!! Never used tubes for walleye... Its cool that you can try new methods and just keep catching them walleyes.
616470,mercman,2011-08-28 18:13:00,7054,Great report Simon.I notice alot of people get smallies while targeting Walleye. Why is that anyways
616472,ehg,2011-08-28 18:15:00,2666,Always enjoy your videos. Kinda like watching a TV fishing show but better.

616553,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-28 23:55:00,130,Are you sure you are not supposed to pay some guy at a booth for each fish you caught?  For the benefit of those that do not get to do such experiments.....what bait/presentation failed to impress the fish or caught more bass than walleye.
616567,johnnyb,2011-08-29 01:01:00,3413,"Awesome stuff, Limey....what a fishery that lake is!  I like the hook inside of that tube jig....what is it?"
616587,rob v,2011-08-29 02:13:00,535,Great stuff - thanks for sharing.
616614,rufus,2011-08-29 02:55:00,267,Great video and pictures Simon. Looks like a fun day!
617343,limeyangler,2011-08-31 11:29:00,5204, It helps to be on a lake where as far as catching is concerned the pressure is off!    The spot i was fishing is just a classic bass habitat...and because it is a reef surrounded by deeper water tha walleye are present also......walleye and bass love minnows/leeches.    :thumbsup_anim:    cooling off?    that day ...although everything seemed to work...i would have to say that leeches were least favourite. I have found this to be the case on Lac Seul on 2 occasions this year.    Hey JB...those hooks are awesom...they have a rattle in them too.      My pleasure.    Thanks man...how's Cletus?
