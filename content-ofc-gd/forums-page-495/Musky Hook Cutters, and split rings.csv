617069,lew,2011-08-30 15:42:00,12766," After you've cut a few 7/0 hooks you'll wonder how you ever got along without the Knipex.  Well worth the $$$$, both for your safety and the fish."
617073,fishnsled,2011-08-30 15:51:00,3520,Some great info Wayne and Lew.
617118,F_ast,2011-08-30 18:04:00,154,They run about $50 at Lowes right?  Anywhere else to find them?  Any place to get a good price?
617127,lew,2011-08-30 18:20:00,12766," I payed around $60 for mine a few years ago so I think $50 is a good deal but other than Lowes I don't know of any other retailers that carry them. I think I heard somewhere that you can get them thru Muskies Canada but I'm no longer a member and don't know for sure, but one of our members should be able to help.  Maybe contact PigeonTroller or MIkeP"
615927,K_F,2011-08-26 18:37:00,107,"didnt wanna hi-jack Matts thread, but its got me thinking.  I currently use cheap cutters (havent bought the knipex) and I find it really tough to cut some hooks that are deep in the throat.  Its always doable - but, I wish my cutters were as long as my needlenose.  Are longer mini bolt cutters on the market?  bought a set of these needlenose off a matco tool truck - best money ive spent on fishing tackle and highly reccomended....very stong.  http://www.gearwrench.com/catalog/pliers/double_x/  Also, split rings.  The ones I have arent tapered in like some of the ones on my lures.  Can anyone reccomend somewhere to get good split rings that are tapered in?  They make for really easy changes. Am I looking at a trip to into JB's?  Ive looked around home and cant find them.  Any insight."
615999,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 21:57:00,4661,Not sure what you mean by tapered rings...  But I've replaced my split rings with wolverine heavy duty rings...  And have tried spro rings as well... But they are way more expensive...
616000,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 21:57:00,4661,Sorry...  Rollie and Helens musky shop
616005,Handlebarz,2011-08-26 22:07:00,3790,best advice I will give ya for your rings is head to WM and get a set of the split ring pliers they sell they are AMAZING and work better then my high $$$ ones.  I have used the heavy stainless steel ones from reel pro AKA luremaking.com they are very good and strong I am not a fan of triple rings for crank baits as they some times mess up how the hooks hang.
616006,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 22:10:00,4661,  That's when I use the spro rings...  And I second the split ring pliers... Very very useful tool...
616014,mattp33,2011-08-26 22:32:00,290,"My guy at the tackle store made me buy split ring pliers today.  We got to talking and he said ""if you are going to musky fish you are going to need these""  He started going around the store and  grabbing thing and those pliers were one of those thing.  Also spro split ring and treble hooks!  I third the very very useful tool!!!"
616031,GBW,2011-08-26 23:07:00,8460,Lowes Canada was selling Knipix cutters for $4x.xx a set?  I have them and I can cut through a deck nail like butter to give you an idea how good and easy they are to use.
616090,Pigeontroller,2011-08-27 01:10:00,2793," Looking at them today at the Lowe's in Hamilton, $47.99"
616098,GBW,2011-08-27 01:16:00,8460,"And they work SOOO well.  We had a guy (cabnet maker) working on some things at my folks place and his dog hook himself right through the nose tip with a hook in his truck.  My dad went and got my knipix and the dog was fre is seconds, no yalping, no blood and the owner was VERY impressed.  even more so with the price.  these are reg. $100 in most musky shops or more."
616318,muskymike,2011-08-28 01:29:00,772, What model do they have at Lowes?
616320,irishfield,2011-08-28 01:40:00,26272,The good ones!  I added the spring and the retention cable. 
616323,muskymike,2011-08-28 01:47:00,772," Perfect, thanks Wayne."
616356,GBW,2011-08-28 11:53:00,8460,All I added was a hello kitty sticker to mine so others would think they are my daughters and not take them.
616358,lew,2011-08-28 12:12:00,12766,"Like Wayne, I also attach my Knipex to the boat 'cept I use a long coiled telephone cord. It coils up to nothing when not being used but can reach anywhere in the boat when needed. You can see them on the floor beside the drivers seat.  Those cutters are too darned expensive to drop in the drink.    And FWIW, when trolling with rods in the holders, I also attach them to the boat with 4' wire cable incase they come outta the holders, which I have seen happen under the strain of huge baits.  "
616401,muskymike,2011-08-28 15:00:00,772," Lew, where are you hooked on to on your Tekota?"
616416,irishfield,2011-08-28 15:44:00,26272,If you look close in this picture Mike you can see the loop of cable around the reel base that gets clipped on to.    Watch out for that wave coming !
616419,lew,2011-08-28 15:48:00,12766," Mike, use the same wire as the safety strap, make a loop a couple inches in diameter and join it with a couple crimps. I also use some shrink wrap on mine.    Loop it over the feet of your reel, then put the reel in the seat of the rod as always. Just be sure the loop is small enough that it can't fit over the top  of the reel and come off.    It works really well and with the safety strap 4 or 5 feet long it doesn't get in the way and after you pick the rod up outta the holder you can simply unhook it."
616422,irishfield,2011-08-28 15:50:00,26272,Funny.. that reel looks just like the one in my photo...
616423,lew,2011-08-28 15:51:00,12766,"Wayne, I don't think I've seen that picture before but if I remember correctly, I think that wave got us.  That was a rough & tumble day"
616425,irishfield,2011-08-28 15:54:00,26272,'twas a little cool as well.... even got you to wear a coat!  
616437,mike rousseau,2011-08-28 16:24:00,4661,Great set up lew...  I really like that idea of attaching the wire to the rods... Thanks a lot... Now I have something to do today in this crappy weather
616443,lew,2011-08-28 16:46:00,12766," That was a fun day Wayne that I'll remember for a long time  I drove up to your place and it was snowing like crazy all the way up, then when we hit the water we could see everything was snow covered on one side of Midland Harbor and bare as a bone on the other side"
616444,lew,2011-08-28 16:49:00,12766," Your more than welcome Mike, it's an idea I got a few years ago from Richard Collins, a great musky guide on the Ottawa River.  Pretty cheap insurance to keep the expensive rods & reels from taking a header into the lake."
616670,K_F,2011-08-29 12:34:00,107,"Thanks again guys,  Lots of good stuff to be learned here"
617065,F_ast,2011-08-30 15:33:00,154,I have to get myself a pair of Knipex.  I have gone through a few sets of the cheaper mini bolt cutters.  The cutting surface just cannot take the the hardness of hooks these days.  Love the phone cord idea LEW.
