A fellow angler, -  Alex"
616272,Rizzo,2011-08-27 21:20:00,4754,"I've always found Balsam to be a hit or miss lake when I target musky. I'll go 3 trips and get 2 fish each time, then I'll go 3 trips getting skunked. I'll tell you one thing, there are some big pickerel in there and they like big musky baits. I get a 5+ pound pickerel almost every time I go there (at least it feels that way). Dang things won't leave me alone. Was there last week for an evening and morning bite. Evening produced a big pickerel on a hellhound glider bait(maybe I'll post the picture later if I get it off the camera) and a 20 inch largemouth, the next morning was 2 muskies (42, dink). Good luck let us know how you do, Some great drop-offs from sand/weed to deep water"

617322,EC1,2011-08-31 05:17:00,930,Bass seem to have moved out of the slop for me. Got a few at 8-12 fow today in the channel today. No bigguns though.
