Thanks, fishinguypat"

Just to note though anything you cook the spoons in should not be used for food afterwards. I found for small items using an old toaster oven works fine. The process of cleaning the spoons after sanding is important and spraying them down with brake cleaner then blowing them off before you preheat them helps. Once cleaned though don't touch them with your hands or the coating will not bond correctly. Finishing off with a clear coat is not needed if the prep is correct the bonding to the metal is harder than paint and is used on motorcycle casings and with special powder 1000 degree exhaust systems.

615893,aplumma,2011-08-26 17:39:00,6896,"The process of powder coating is melting the powder into a solid sheet on the metal. It causes a bond between the CLEAN metal and the plastic. You can clear coat it if you want but it is a step that is not needed if the powder cured correctly. I have used powder coating on motorcycle casings, lawn furniture,chisels, and tool handles without clear coating. If you really want you can get a clear coat powder that we use to keep aluminum from turning after you polish it it adds depth without a chemical reaction.   Art"
