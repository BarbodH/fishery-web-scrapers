I brought my neighbour out with me to do a little perch fishin.  Caught a ton of dinks, and lots of sun fish.  No perch bigger then 8"".  Caught this guy in the middle of the bay, 30' of water.  I've caught lots of catfish, but never one with spots like this.  Some sort of sickness or parasite?  Holland river crop dusting maybe?    "
