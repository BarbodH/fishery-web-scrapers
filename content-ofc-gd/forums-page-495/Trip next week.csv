Have been reading up on fall fishing for pickeral and sounds like the bite can be slow.  any idea's ?  what's my best option this time of year?  I have aquired a wide range of tail dancers and worm harnesses.  i usually fish for them early season (opener) and here and there thru the summer months.  do you think that given the time of year, they could still be in summer mode? bill"
