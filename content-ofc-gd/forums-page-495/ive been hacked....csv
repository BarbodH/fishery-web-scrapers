616992,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-30 13:04:00,1022,I was contacted by my IT department yesterday and told that my computer has malware on it. Judging by passwords being taken from others I suspect this is the case with those affected as well.
617005,mike rousseau,2011-08-30 13:25:00,4661, i did a full computer antivirus scan... but i guess nowadays that doesnt help much...  as far as i can tell i have controll back... ive changed all my passwords...etc...
617071,adolson,2011-08-30 15:44:00,783, I run Linux. So I sincerely doubt it in my case..
617086,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-30 16:26:00,1022, Did you do an update prior to running the scan?
617104,SirWhite,2011-08-30 17:26:00,210,One piece of advice:  NO Internet Explorer  USE Mozilla Firefox it has security features that prevent viruses and popups from getting your info.  True Story  and watch out on Google Images one click could cost you big bucks.
617109,mike rousseau,2011-08-30 17:40:00,4661,since ive been hacked... my computer screen flickers from time to time...  does anybody know why...?
617131,Rod Caster,2011-08-30 18:32:00,5784,"If you have a built in webcam, put a piece of black tape on the eye... or at least put a shirt on. THEY ARE WATCHING YOU!  Maybe try resetting your IP address. I'm not a computer wiz, but there is a way of doing that... google it or call your Internet Service Provider.  "
617133,mike rousseau,2011-08-30 18:39:00,4661,Got microsoft security essentials and it found some adware thing...  Hope that was the problem...  Also got firefox...  Thanks everyone...

616765,HTHM,2011-08-29 18:53:00,4082,"Oh great, I sent you my credit card info for no reason at all?? Sorry to hear that Mike. In retrospect maybe I should change my password from 1234 to 4321...."

616769,grimsbylander,2011-08-29 19:03:00,3016,  HAHA Good point!!  Just read your last post and I don't blame you for being ticked off. Who gets their jollies causing someone grief?? I always imagine this is done by some little coward sitting in his Mom's basement. How would you like to meet them face to face? Just once!
616773,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 19:17:00,4661,"heres the message that ""I"" sent gbw...  :spam:  :spam:  I'm writing this with tears in My eyes My Family and I came down here to (Leyton, London) for a short vacation,unfortunately We got mugged last night in alley by a gang of thugs on our way back from shopping, one of them had a knife poking my neck for almost two minutes and everything we had on us including my cell phone, credit cards were all stolen,quite honestly it was beyond a dreadful experience for us but looking on the bright side we weren't seriously hurt or injured and we are still alive so that is whats important.  We've been to the embassy and the Police here but they're not helping issues at all and our flight leaves in less than few hrs from now, but I'm really having some difficulties clearing our hotel bills and also need to pick up a voucher ticket at the counter for us to catch a flight back home in a couple of hours.  Am freaked out at the moment and i need your help right away! wondering if you could please loan me some money to settle the hotel bills and get a flight back home, i promise to def refund it back as soon as i return home.  Hanging in here to read from you.  Mike.    :spam:  :spam:"

He uses better gramar  Just kidding Mike........Hope you know that. Sounds like you have had a run of bad luck lately. Sorry to hear about this latest .  "
616780,Roy,2011-08-29 19:26:00,13728,That's a really old (by internet standards) scam. It's not a hack job. Your email problem is something completely unrelated.
616782,motion,2011-08-29 19:28:00,403,Darn hackers! Just found out our business phone system was hacked by long distance thieves. They made 4 hours worth of call to Nicaragua so Bell shut it down. Apparently they hack though your voice mail system so we had to change all the passwords. That just sucks!
616784,cheaptackle,2011-08-29 19:30:00,849,"Add this to your contact list in your e-mail program:  [email protected]  You'll immediately get an error e-mail if anything is sent to this address from you and then you will know you've been hacked, hopefully before they get around to changing your passwords.  It's not the best but at least it's something.  Michael"
616793,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 19:53:00,4661,im into my accounts again  here's the email addy to give you guys a heads up...        [email protected]
616813,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-29 21:08:00,336," I too have been hacked into this past weekend.    Perverted crap sent to all my contacts.    My mother, pastor Thanks for this tip."
616822,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-29 21:40:00,336,"  When my dad died in 08 my family wrote an obituary of his life.   Some scammer must have studied ours and preyed on my mothers grief.  Canadian fishing has been a huge part of our world and they worked it into their scam. My mother was contacted by someone purporting to be Canadian authority and they have my nephew in jail.   My nephew is a DEA agent and posesses a MMA belt.  His percieved trouble would have cost him his job so my mother sent the money.  These low life scammers prey on good people through obits and the like.  It seems that here in the states something could be done to spank these idiots!  No, we are busy letting baby rapists run free and busting good people for pot."
616858,irishfield,2011-08-30 00:23:00,26272,Guessing you have a gmail account...
616863,Roy,2011-08-30 00:47:00,13728, That is heartbreaking stuff.  Sorry your Mother and your family had to go through that on account of some low-life waste of skin.
616867,adolson,2011-08-30 01:00:00,783,"I was hacked a few weeks ago. I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but I noticed it within seconds because I was watching a video on my PS3 with my wife beside me on the couch, when suddenly I'm signed out due to signing in at another location. I couldn't get back in. I tried my email, couldn't get in there either. I managed to reset my email account quickly, and then reset my PS3 password. The IP address in my email's activity history is a TOR IP, therefore it's useless - anonymous network utilized by hackers, amongst others.  Hasn't happened since, but some odd timing... I signed up for an angler site right before this occurred. But that may be coincidence, considering the PS3 hacking and whatnot. But how my email and PS3 account were linked together, I have no idea, as they're completely different domains and everything... What's that mean?"
616918,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-30 03:39:00,336,  Thank you Roy for your thoughtfulness.  I did happen to notice slight adjustment in my post.    Low-life waste of skin is better.
616920,irishfield,2011-08-30 03:45:00,26272,"  I've only seen the.. .I've been mugged.. send money.. email from contacts of mine that have gmail accounts, which leads me to believe they aren't overly secure."
616940,Billy Bob,2011-08-30 10:49:00,5865, I have had a Gmail account for YEARS......but I use a elaborate password...now a friend of mine used his address for his password and he got hacked.
