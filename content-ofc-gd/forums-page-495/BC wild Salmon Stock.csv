Very unfortunate that the DFO would attempt to bar this information and stay in the pocket of the salmon farmers. The provincial Govt should be ashamed of itself for not taking action on this, knowing full well what happened to the Cod fishery out East. People don't seem to learn... Thanks again for sharing."
