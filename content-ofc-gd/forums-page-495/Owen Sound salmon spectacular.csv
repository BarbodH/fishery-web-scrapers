616926,lakemaster,2011-08-30 07:42:00,36,"Whoa isn√®t Owen sound in Lake Ontario how come the flesh of the salmon there are color red, the one I catch in Lake Ontario are colour white its nasty, Does the salmon in owen sound taste good?"
616929,Terry,2011-08-30 09:24:00,14456,great video
616944,Jer,2011-08-30 10:56:00,1426,"  Owen Sound is on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron."
616949,danbouck,2011-08-30 11:08:00,4380,Awesome vid!
616956,FrankTheRabbit,2011-08-30 11:29:00,479,"Regarding Rjay's comment about the salmon flesh, is there a reason for the difference in colour? I too have noticed their flesh being white from Lake O."
616963,wallacio,2011-08-30 11:59:00,475,"The difference in the flesh colour with fish from Georgian Bay vs Lake Ontario is due to their diet.   Specifically, prey items which contain carotenoids (usually invertebrates).  The Salmon in Lake Ontario feed primarily on oily baitfish such as Alewife (as well as Smelt) which do not contain Carotenoids so their flesh is white and (IMO) not very palatable.    Baitfish populations in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay crashed around 2004 and fish have had to switch to other food sources including invertebrates which contributes to their flesh being orange.  Since they are not eating oily baitfish, they are quite tasty!  Great video BTW.   Talk about bumper boats out there!"
617067,FrankTheRabbit,2011-08-30 15:39:00,479,Makes perfect sense. Thanks for the clarification!

617303,HTHM,2011-08-31 03:20:00,4082,"What an excellent explanation, thank you!"
617428,12footspringbok,2011-08-31 15:44:00,459,Sweet video of a great event thats doable for the smaller less serious angler. That shot of the boat lights in the early morning doesn't do it justice. One has to pay attention to which direction they're trolling out there...LOL  Edited to add: Good to see alot more healthy fish out there this year with lots of high teen salmon being weighed in
617489,lakemaster,2011-08-31 19:04:00,36, but still how come there flesh is red
617490,lakemaster,2011-08-31 19:05:00,36, Yeh I know that the salmon in the west coast have red flesh because they eat prawn ( red shrimps) I dont think theres prawn in lake huron
617491,lakemaster,2011-08-31 19:06:00,36, ohhh wow so its good to eat the salmon up there hmm Im going to try fishing there one day
