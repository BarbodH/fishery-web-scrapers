Any recommendation  Thanks,"
617153,irishfield,2011-08-30 19:42:00,26272,"James.. go practice backing up in a parking lot, better yet an industial park with a truck loading ramp so you can see first hand how the boat disappears out of the mirror range. Oh.. practice putting the drain plug in as well..."
617157,Roy,2011-08-30 19:56:00,13728,"You might also want to get a little practice removing the tie downs, removing the transom saver and putting out the bumpers."
617161,ra95,2011-08-30 20:08:00,49,I tried backing on my drive way. I need to find a slope to feel the ramp
617177,smally21,2011-08-30 20:41:00,993,if the boat ramp is wide enough for 2 boats you shouldn't be in the middle of it!
617183,Roy,2011-08-30 20:55:00,13728,"With some of the ramps we have, you might get better practice backing it off a cliff."

Maybe pracitse on a weekday in the middle of the day?"
617226,workwear,2011-08-30 22:37:00,592,"great vids......but who really ""pushes"" their boats off a trailer......usually i just get backed in and float off of my trailer...  great advise from the others......when i first learned....i too went to an industrial complex on a sunday afternoon and tried on their loading docks....great experience from it...."
