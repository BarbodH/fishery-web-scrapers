616718,Dave Bailey,2011-08-29 15:44:00,1641,"From someone calling themselves axe1112:   Can't see this one getting any traction. There are probably cottagers on the lake with more than 40hp, what are they supposed to do?"
616720,Terry,2011-08-29 15:46:00,14456,"well it's a land locked lake, they just may get it the way things are going"
616753,cheaptackle,2011-08-29 18:31:00,849,I called BULL and challenged the OP for some details.  I've only been away from Dal a few years and there ain't no way there's a 20 year old anglers association that I wouldn't have heard of or had belonged to!  As for the rest of the fantasy....did I read something about traction? (seems like SOMEONE has one wheel in the sand).  He'd have more luck reintroducing walleye stocking!  Michael
616761,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-29 18:48:00,4399,These Dalrymple cottage types are getting out of hand!
616781,kickingfrog,2011-08-29 19:26:00,8333, I agree.
616785,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-29 19:30:00,4399,  Not a cottager Rob but I do enjoy Dalrymple every weekend from April to the end of October!  See ya Friday I know your looking forward to spending a week in a cabin with a couple of Habs fans!!!   Nakina or Bust!!!
616859,irishfield,2011-08-30 00:32:00,26272,"Well don't be too quick to turn your eye off the situation... we had a cottage association on Temagami that made an attempt at banning floatplanes.. regardless of the fact that at least 20 of their own members owned same. Of course like everything else they do they probably would have tried a grandfather clause for ""it's fine of us, but nobody else"" !"
616862,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-30 00:44:00,130,hahaha 40HP....I guess they have just enough people on the lake that think 40HP is enough for them because that is what they own?  If they were brining this up as a matter of pricipal they would go with the more standard low or 0 HP restrictions OR went with a dB type restriction like 25HP for 2 strokes and 40HP for 4-strokes.  How about baning water skiing....wait some people like doing that (I find them a pain)  I may be jumping the gun a little but my little voice tells me that they are selfish jerks.
616885,bigugli,2011-08-30 01:51:00,6138,"What is so unusual about requesting a horsepower ceiling? As I recall there were a number of lakes that successfully petitioned for similar horsepower restrictions, and other associations were successful in obtaining restrictions on all motorized craft. Mind that was back in the 80's and 90's. It very much depends upon the reasons behind the request. There are a few big stakeholders, such as the resort, that would be quick to oppose such a request."
616908,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-30 03:10:00,4399,"I am still not convinced this is real, wouldn`t surprise me if it was the same    that put up the MNR sign on his dock. Perhaps Craig Smith was by and told him to remove the sign and now he`s upset."
617089,Jon,2011-08-30 16:41:00,209,"There are actually a number of lakes and rivers with boating restrictions (e.g. no boats, speed and horsepower limits, no electric or power propulsion).  The list can be found at: Canada Shipping Act/  I couldn't find Dalyrmple in there but maybe your lake is already listed.  Jon"
617129,jimmer,2011-08-30 18:26:00,2730,Everyone wants a private lake Can't see them setting a precedent with Dalrymple.
