Lots of people are finding fish and sea turtles miles from the ocean. And this one guy found a shark swimming up his street.    That's the difference between Ontario and Puerto Rico. There, they take its picture.  Here, by now it would already have about 20 treble hooks stuck in it."

617007,Roy,2011-08-30 13:30:00,13728,Sorry rain on your flooded street but that pic is a hoax. Try comparing that shark to the National Geographic 2005 issue of the shark and the kayak. What I CAN tell you though is that there's surely a pic about to hit the net depicting a flooded NYC street with Jimmy Hoffa going downstream on a one way.

617326,pikehunter,2011-08-31 08:38:00,1659,"Wonder what the daily limit for shark is in Ontario? Cllues in the picture give it away as a fake. Look atthe water depth along the barricades and the photogtaphers side view mirror is in the pic. Don't think he would be driving in water deep enough for that size of shark to swim in, non the less it's a great picture and gets the imagination working."
