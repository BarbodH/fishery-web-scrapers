614239,spincast,2011-08-22 09:16:00,3279,Yikes. Amazing power the wind has. Thanks for the pics. Shame about the church - always thought that was a very striking building. Town will never look the same - lots of those buildings will have to be demolished.

614279,bigbuck,2011-08-22 12:44:00,2449,"That was a pretty little downtown area. Too bad, most of the old buildings will have to come down now. The power of Mother Nature is just simply astounding."
614415,splashhopper,2011-08-22 16:37:00,2931,"My fishing buddy, with the blue taurus in the pics, was right in the thick of it.  Said the noise was horrific and the flying debris was brutal. He sustained minor cuts and bruised from debris. The drivers side of his ( lake side) is destroyed is grateful to be alive."

617245,Musky or Specks,2011-08-30 23:34:00,2710,My cousin just sent me a pic of his house. My aunt's and uncles place was missed and same with another cousin although he's part of Mine Rescue so he had to deal with some of the real bad crap.       He lives pretty close to the square so he counts himself lucky
