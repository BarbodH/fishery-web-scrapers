616727,limeyangler,2011-08-29 16:18:00,5204,"Hi All,  posting to let y'all know ive been a non smoker for 3 months now!   To everyone who offered support and advice...thanks...i owe some of my success to you   I would like to recommend trying the patches to anyone considering quitting. I had been a smoker for over 30 years and had never even tried quitting before. The main reason i had not attempted to quit was the fear of feeling the withdrawals. I am happy to say that the withdrawals were nowhere near as difficult as i had anticipated and the patch definitely works. The whole reuction course of patches is 10 weeks and i'm now 2 weeks without even the patches.  The first patch free week was tough.....but having 2 1/2 months of practicing not smoking was a definite help too.   If you do try the patch....i also recommend taking it off at night....and also try taking it off early in the day when you are feeling strong....this helped me in the transitions to lower strength patches.  I start my fitness blitz next Monday....because i am putting on weight."

616731,Rod Caster,2011-08-29 16:30:00,5784,By fitness blitz you mean intense arm workouts right? All those Walleye must have given you disproportionately large biceps!  Congrats on quitting!
616734,mercman,2011-08-29 17:08:00,7054,"Congrats Simon. I bought a box of step 1 patches in January, and like you, the fear of the withdrawl kept me from making a real attempt to quit.After your success, i may give them a go,who knows   "
616738,John,2011-08-29 17:14:00,2956,"Awesome Simon, as I said in my PM, you are definitely a non-smoker and that's amazing. Stay with it and you and your family will never regret it.

616823,ChrisK,2011-08-29 21:41:00,2772,"That a boy Simon. I've been off the butts for 25 years now. Helped my wife quit cold turkey about 20 years ago. Do yourself a favor and keep cut veggies in the fridge like carrot sticks,celery and collie flower. Makes for great munchies when you get the uncontrollable urge to eat just for the sake of eating."
616827,rufus,2011-08-29 21:54:00,267,WTG Simon  I wish they had the patch back when I quit!
616854,toca,2011-08-30 00:07:00,274,"Good job another three months and you are in clear sailing. Also I've been almost six months and 1/3 your years of smoking. The biggest mistake was to take fla few drags of foreign smokes.... You know what I found out? I did not enjoy it and I didn't miss it either, but for two weeks I was really irritated and got upset very easily. Also please don't be smug about it. I really hate these ex smokers and they put down or feel sorry for them smokers and it really pathetic. The only thing I find annoying is those that say they want to quit or going to quit but make no efforts at all!!!!"
616857,irishfield,2011-08-30 00:18:00,26272,Jack will love you for it Simon... did I say that before??
616866,Daplumma,2011-08-30 00:58:00,1961,"Congrats,the only way you will ever smoke again is if you light one up.You got this beat,cause I dont think anyone else will do that to you.Good job.  Joe"
