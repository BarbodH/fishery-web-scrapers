617457,codegreen,2011-08-31 17:31:00,9,"Hey Guys,  My fiance and I are heading up that way on the 9th of Sept weekend and I was wondering if anyone might know of any areas that are decent for walleye/pike from shore. We'll be using minnows/worms as well.  Any info would be great as we don't get out that much to fish.  Thanks in advance.  cg"
617468,mike rousseau,2011-08-31 18:04:00,4661,sorry... onshore walleye spots are to precious to share... there are enough guys fighting over which rock they get to stand on next...  there is miles of public shoreline in the cornwall area... take your rod and go for a walk and you might get lucky....
617484,Roy,2011-08-31 18:38:00,13728,I'd help you but I don't fish the Cornwall area at all. If I were you I'd buy my bait somewhere there and have a talk with the baitshop people. Good luck.
617488,codegreen,2011-08-31 18:59:00,9," Well, that doesn't seem like much of a help lol, but I can see where you're coming from. I'm originally from the area (Finch, Ont) but I have been gone from the fishing scene for 13+ years in that area.  Would anyone recommend the Power Dam area near Cornwall, I think there's a trout pond somewhere on Power Dam dr....what about the Long Sault causeway...  Yeah, that sounds like it may be the best way to get info, just speak with the local bait shop guys.."
