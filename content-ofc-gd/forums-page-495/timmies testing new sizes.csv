616951,Musky or Specks,2011-08-30 11:12:00,2710,Disappointed still haven't introduced Tub'O'Coffee
616952,BillM,2011-08-30 11:12:00,17367,More like the US everyday...  Sad really.
616957,blaque,2011-08-30 11:40:00,2419, Think of that as a good thing......better steelhead fishing
616972,smally21,2011-08-30 12:27:00,993,its gonna be called the 'panic attack size' and comes with 6 cigarettes...
616973,NAW,2011-08-30 12:28:00,4022,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that Tims used to have Extra Large coffies that where huge.  A few years back, maybe 6 or 7, they dropped there sizes down smaller.?  Anyone else remember this, or have I put to much baileys in my Tims this morning..."
616976,smally21,2011-08-30 12:41:00,993,"im with you NAW - in college there you used to be a giant coffee we called 'the pail' because it should have had a bucket style handle on it. the coffee was the size of an apple juice can. if i drank a whole one i'd curl up in a ball in the corner and shake for a few hours....paranoia, hallucinations, frequent urination, etc.  don't know when it went off the menu but good riddance. it was like a speedball in a paper cup!"
616978,BillM,2011-08-30 12:42:00,17367," Eh, there isn't much south of the border that can even hold a candle to a Notty or Saugeen fish.  Now, if you're into cookie cutter stockers, then yeah the US is a great place to fish, lol."
617088,kickingfrog,2011-08-30 16:35:00,8333,"Well how about that, a coffee thread turned to a fishing thread. It's normaly goes the other way.;-)"
617091,solopaddler,2011-08-30 16:42:00,8605,"  So I guess Michigan isn't part of the States then?  The Salmon River in Pulaski is pretty incredible too...   As far as the giant coffees go, bring 'em on!!"
617092,JTorra,2011-08-30 16:47:00,50,"Ughhh...a large Timmies is too much, never mind a ""super sized"" portion.  Admittedly, it is used a a caffeine delivery mechanism that I use when in a jam."
617095,solopaddler,2011-08-30 17:04:00,8605, You're way too healthy for your own good.  FYI Sept 28-Oct 2 is set aside for a trip north!
617096,blaque,2011-08-30 17:09:00,2419, Oh I'm into cookie cutter stockers   lol

617168,Rod Caster,2011-08-30 20:26:00,5784,"I'm glad they didn't bring it here, otherwise the junkies would be blocking my driveway even more than they already do."
617203,porkpie,2011-08-30 21:26:00,2521,"  Lol,  did you go fishing there just once?? Some Erie tribs have some incredible scenery, and some unbelievable fishing.... although its not as quiet as it was 15-20 years ago.  And I find the fish can definately hold a candle to a Notty or Saugeen fish, having beached many of them over the years!  You have clearly never hit a 20 in a trib on the south shore of lake O."
617205,Muskieman,2011-08-30 21:37:00,2472,"My bud Terry brought me one from Sudbury 24 Oz  XL   I have 2  XL   3x3  every morning (from previous coffee topics hasn't changed), my wife has a M/ Mocha ... 6$... add a after supper run to that and ya got  10$/ day... that's 300$/Mo .... X 12 + ? ... now who's good at math?  ... see what I mean?  For me, a 24 Oz will replace 2x regular XL's for a Toonie.. that translates to about say... 700-800$/yr toward my spring shopping spree.......... I'm all for this Idea ...It did the trick for me..  But...........  I'm still angry at myself/spouse for allowing ourselves to spend this much on COFFEE...per year ... really. This cuts into my ,Beer / Smokes / Miscellaneous budget.  Does anyone else have this problem?   Randy "
617211,mercman,2011-08-30 21:56:00,7054,"Not me Randy. I make my coffee at home,2 double vanilla cappucinos, and at work, i have a Bunn-o-matic that i keep full for my customers for free. never drink Tims coffee, it sucks."
617212,kickingfrog,2011-08-30 21:56:00,8333,"Wow Randy, you may need a wrist brace."
