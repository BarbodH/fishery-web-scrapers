616061,fishboy,2011-08-27 00:04:00,550,I was Tue and Wed and had some time to see if the smallmouth were willing to play.  They seemed to be interested in lipless cranks and tubes...here are a couple:  
616084,EC1,2011-08-27 00:54:00,930,"Nice. In Haliburton, ive tried jerkbaits, and topwaters without much luck this year. Will try tubes and Cranks next time if I go back before the end of summer."
616108,Toad Hunter,2011-08-27 01:37:00,261,"Headin that way next weekend hopin for some eyes but would ""settle"" for some of these beauties that's for sure.."
616235,fishboy,2011-08-27 16:49:00,550, This year has been one of the more challenging...the bass never really settled into the usual patterns.
616432,limeyangler,2011-08-28 16:07:00,5204,a couple of pretty big bass right there...never had luck on tubes up here....mepps seem to be killer.
616537,singingdog,2011-08-28 22:22:00,1047,Lipless cranks have been a great producer for me this year. Nice fish.
616538,fishboy,2011-08-28 22:23:00,550,thanks...I'm not usually a crankbait guy but you have to feed the fish what they want...
617079,F_ast,2011-08-30 15:58:00,154,Smallies smash spinner baits and jointed minnow baits on our lake.  They also kill inline spinners with black grubs line lining for lakers over 80FOW withing reasonable proximity to 35ft humps.
617267,Toad Hunter,2011-08-31 01:34:00,261,Can't go wrong with an ol lucky strike tiped with a gulp alive leech (almost anythin eats that !)
