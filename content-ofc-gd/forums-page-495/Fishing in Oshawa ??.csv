617451,TheKDOG1970,2011-08-31 16:57:00,4,"Hi everyone, I'm a newbie to fishing here in Ontario and specifically to Oshawa.  Was wondering if anyone has any decent places to just through out a line and maybe catch a fish or two, doesn't matter what kind, just want to get out and have a little fun.  I've read about Wilmot creek but not really sure where on it to try so I'm going to head out today and try a few places but any help would be appreciated.  Thanks, K."
617454,ricoboxing,2011-08-31 17:13:00,398,"oshawa creek would be a good place to start. look for some structure, usually a shopping cart or the occasional dead body. the salmon should be staging down by the pier anytime now."
617455,ctranter,2011-08-31 17:25:00,543,Scugog is 20 minutes north of Oshawa.  It holds a variety of different species.  I hear people fish from the docks in Port Perry and near the boat launch.  Good luck

There are lots of fish in the area...just depends on how mobile you are...what equipment you have and what you skill level is...  For instance, big Salmon are at creek mouths, but you will have to fight potential crowds and have a pretty good heavy setup.  If panfish is what you want then there are lots of potential places as well.  Oshawa creek is a good start.  Here's a link that may be useful...always make sure you have the regulations handy to see what's in season and what is not etc...depending on the time of year, not all these spots are open. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165643.html"
617461,Harrison,2011-08-31 17:47:00,2202, ..... what about for walleye Cliff????? hmm hmmm....  sorry had to.
617463,ccmtcanada,2011-08-31 17:49:00,7971," LOL Harrison!  Truth be told, I haven't tried for them in over a year in that ""spot"".  You can only catch so many 13 lb+ walleye before you start getting bored.  Trade you a spot for that new Okuma float reel??? LOL"
617473,Harrison,2011-08-31 18:20:00,2202,"HA! your a good man Cliff.  Let me know where you want to meet up, I just finished printing off the reel for ya."

617533,TheKDOG1970,2011-08-31 21:25:00,4," Thanks, I'll check it out.  K."
617534,TheKDOG1970,2011-08-31 21:26:00,4,"   Appreciate your support, I haven't caught a Salmon before, may be fun but panfish are the easiest.  Also would love to catch some Pike or bass if there are any around.  K."
