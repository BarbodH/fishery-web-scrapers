I know its a long shot but if there are any Toronto contractors on here looking for a guy please let me know. I have been working for myself for the last 9 months and don't have a large enough customer base to keep my head above the water (pun intended). I am skilled in ALL home maitenance/ reno work, and just looking for someone to work under so I don't have to stress about where the money is going to come from. So please if you know of anyone PM me. Also if anyone on this site has an problems (house related) feel free to ask for advice, I'm always more than happy to help. Thanks."
