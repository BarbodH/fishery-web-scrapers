593266,Fish Farmer,2011-06-15 13:01:00,2234,"I've been using my CTEK charger and it gets fairly hot, is that normal? I know there is a few guys on here that has one. Thanks for any info."
593268,Dan668,2011-06-15 13:08:00,1120, Yup mine gets hot.
593271,mercman,2011-06-15 13:16:00,7054,So does my MinnKota portable.
593280,scugpg,2011-06-15 13:46:00,1373,Yup mine too. Weaker the battery more hot it gets I think it works off resistance some way also make sure connections are clean and tight
593333,Fisherman,2011-06-15 16:26:00,7201,"i've got 2 of them, they may get warm but not hot to the touch.  If I have to recharge a battery that's been depleted, then it goes on the auto car charger first and then back on the CTEC."
593334,Fish4Eyes,2011-06-15 16:30:00,1022," By CTEC do you mean the setting with the pic of the motorcycle? That setting charges at the lowest aperage. I only use that setting, but I don't deplete my battery totally."
593405,Fisherman,2011-06-15 20:00:00,7201,"No, those settings are for different sized batteries.  What I mean is, I use a larger Schumacher 10Amp charger when the battery is really down, it would take a long time for the CTEC to bring a big deep cycle back up to 100%."
593451,Fish Farmer,2011-06-15 21:57:00,2234,"I used my new 27 deep cycle battery every day last week for 7 days strait, every night I came in, It got hooked up to the CTEK on the car setting. In the morning it showed 1/2 battery, it didn't get fully charged. I think on that setting it only gets 2 amps. Like Fisherman says. Since I came home it's been charging 2 days now and it's not 100 %"
593457,Roy,2011-06-15 22:14:00,13728,The C-Tek is more a maintainer than a charger. It's a great little gizmo but I'd say your boat would have to be plugged in all the time it's not on the water.
593460,icefisherman,2011-06-15 22:15:00,952,"My runs warm but I wouldn't say hot....very good charger...quite happy with it so far.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
593861,Fish Farmer,2011-06-17 01:20:00,2234,Findley hit 100% and has cold off.
593920,Billy Bob,2011-06-17 11:44:00,5865,I agree with Roy.....you really need a on-board charger if your fishing day after day....you little C-Tek would probably be OK if you just fished one day in the week....with my Cabela's on-board charger both my batteries are ready to go in just a few hours...but it will send more amps to the battery that needs them more....so my cranking battery will recharge on the way in so most of my amps will go to the trolling motor battery. Here's what I have mounted in my boat (ProSport II 12)....like it very much.   http://www.cabelas.com/product/Boating/AutoBoat-Batteries-Chargers/On-Board-Chargers-Inverters%7C/pc/104794380/c/104698080/sc/104465880/Cabelas-Advanced-Anglers-ProSport-II-On-Board-Marine-Battery-Chargers/734150.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fboating-auto-boat-batteries-chargers-on-board-chargers-inverters%2F_%2FN-1100565%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_104465880%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104794380%253Bcat104698080&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104794380%3Bcat104698080%3Bcat104465880
593921,Roy,2011-06-17 11:59:00,13728,I'm using this one for my two TM batteries...the main starter battery looks after itself. http://www.cabelas.com/product/Boating/AutoBoat-Batteries-Chargers/On-Board-Chargers-Inverters|/pc/104794380/c/104698080/sc/104465880/Guest-Charge-Pro-Waterproof-On-Board-Battery-Chargers/737490.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse.cmd%3FN%3D1100565%26WTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104794380%253Bcat104698080&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104794380%3Bcat104698080%3Bcat104465880
593933,scugpg,2011-06-17 13:09:00,1373,"Guys CTEK makes a 7 amp charger designed for larger batteries.  If your charging 110AH 31 series batteries or bigger you're pushing it to its absolute limit being a 3.3A charger on the 3300. Recommended range I think is 1.2 to 120AH on their US site.  I have no issues charging my batteries, but I have the small deep cycles somewhere around 55AH. If I charge the really big batteries it gets really warm and takes a very long time. Also as per manual for the 3 settings (motorcycle to Optima symbol):  Mode 14.4V/0.8A This mode is normally used for batteries <14Ah. Mode 14.4V/3.3A Normal setting for wet batteries, maintenance free and for most Gel batteries. Some gel batteries prefer a slightly lower voltage. Please consult the battery manufacturer when in doubt. Mode 14.7V/3.3A This setting is recommended for a battery at temperatures <41Â°F. It is also recommended for many AGM batteries like Optima, Maxxima and Odysses. Consult your battery manufacturer when in doubt."
593948,Fisherman,2011-06-17 14:22:00,7201,"They are on sale this week coming for $49, 40% off."
593949,Roy,2011-06-17 14:25:00,13728, They seem to go on sale every 5-6 weeks at CTC.
594019,ColdH20guy,2011-06-17 20:31:00,312,I have one as well (that get hot) but I would much rather have the nautilus one with the digital readouts....I know they are on sale right now as well at CTC but I really dont need 3 chargers!
