I've just purchased a Garmin 500c and its uses either 200kHz or 77kHz. I've noticed, when using the split frequencie screen that one seems to mark better arches while the other seems to have better bottom definition.  Is it as simple as that or is there mor to it. Is it better to use one vs the other when in deep/shallow water.  Thanks"

593960,Roy,2011-06-17 15:08:00,13728,200 KHZ will give you the best definition. It'll give you minute details of underwater structure including fish. 50 - 90 KHZ give you much greater depth penetration but less definition.
