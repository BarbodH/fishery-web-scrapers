592669,fisher,2011-06-13 22:24:00,451,"We are spending a week on Buckhorn (first time there) July 2-9th and was wondering if anyone can suggest any areas/presentations that would work on walleye and crappie on that lake at that time of the year.  Our cottage is just about right on the point between Buckhorn and Chemong (pretty much on the narrows dividing the two lakes).  Any suggestions on what we can use, places to concentrate?  I have a fish finder with GPS and navionics chips that I will be using for the first time - hoping it will be useful.  Thanks."
592705,Jer,2011-06-13 23:04:00,1426,"We don't tend to get much of a crappie bite at that time of year, more incidental catches while fishing walleye or bass.  One place to concentrate on near your cottage, would be in the channel out front of the bay in front of Emerald Isle Marina. There is some deepish water (15' or so) with some big humped weed beds to the south of the channel. Jig the edge of the humps and you might find a walleye or two.  Good luck and enjoy your stay."
592825,Dutch,2011-06-14 02:07:00,831,"I don't want to sound facetious, but skip on over to Pigeon and fish Grenadier Island and points south.  Look for stained water with coontail humps in the 5+ feet range and you'll get walleye."
592927,Harrison,2011-06-14 12:33:00,2202,"Both gents have given great areas to have a look at.  Personally I like the deeper stuff Jer talked about above.  Find the old river channels and fish the weedlines on the edges. Here is a link to a post I made a lil while ago, with some ideas of how I get Kawartha walleye this time of year.  http://""http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=42144&hl=flipping%20jog&st=0""  The fish below was caught almost right in front of where your going.

592978,jimmer,2011-06-14 15:11:00,2730,Tough to find stained water at that time of the year. You will have to look for the thickest weedbeds in the deeper sections to find any concentration of fish. Fishing after dark might help.
593134,fisher,2011-06-14 23:08:00,451,thanks for all the tips....I'll give them a try and will report when I get back.
593282,fishindevil,2011-06-15 13:59:00,6254,"troll drops and points with worm harnesses,or stay out from edges,and dropshot them big time !!!  cheers and have fun"
593484,Billy Bob,2011-06-15 23:19:00,5865,Go either direction away from the main channel looking for a flat with weeds in about 14-16'...then use 1/8 all black bucktail jigs at the edge of the weeds....I have done very good in I believe the uppper Buckhorn Lake where Deer Bay (Beachwood Resort) breaks off from the main channel...so any area similar should be good.  http://www.beachwoodresort.com/
