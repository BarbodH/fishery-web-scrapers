593191,mercman,2011-06-15 02:19:00,7054,"The wife and i did our usual outing.Get home from work, grab a bite, on the water by 6.30. We have our usual spots, and we have been watching the other boats on the water carefully for clues as to where the Eyes can be hiding. We get one, but they dont seem to be there in quantity.The perch however, are getting bigger and better. I'd love to be able to post bigger and more fish, but that will come soon i'm sure. I have been getting OOS smallies lately, so when the season opens here on Friday, maybe i will have some good fish to show off. Here are the makings of a good little meal.  "
593192,HTHM,2011-06-15 02:24:00,4082,That middle perch looks like Quasimoto...or maybe a camel crossbreed
593194,irishfield,2011-06-15 02:28:00,26272,"Great to see you putting that boat to regular usage Paul!.. and with the wife, can't beat that."
593217,Rod Caster,2011-06-15 03:02:00,5784,"Nice feed!! Those are really nice perch Paul. Walleye aren't always easy to catch, sometimes just getting one is difficult. Good luck next time."
593232,fishnsled,2011-06-15 04:01:00,3520,Nicely done Paul.
593233,beginner,2011-06-15 04:06:00,542,thats a good size for eating... nice catch...
593308,Leecher,2011-06-15 15:00:00,7832,Nice catch Paul Are you trolling or jigging to get those? and are you allowed live bait such as minnows? I'm only asking cause my preffered way of targetting walleyes is to drift and jig with twister tail & live leeches since up here no live minnows allowed in my zone. Jacques
593319,mercman,2011-06-15 15:40:00,7054," Thanks Jacques Spinners and Dew Worms Jacques.On saurday, Roy and i were useing Rapala XRaps and other hard baits,trolling on a bottom bouncer setup up. All i got was an OOS Bass.The 2 shown above were caught in shallow(less than 8Ft) of water. I will find them....garanteed.  Paul"
593322,Oggie,2011-06-15 15:48:00,588,I fish the upper Ottawa river and I haven't been doing very well either. The slot size means alot of fish go back before June 15th.  I wonder if the Quebec side of the Ottawa river has a slot size?  Dan O.
593326,Leecher,2011-06-15 16:07:00,7832," Bottom bouncer is an effective way of targetting them and also cover a lot of water.... Good luck with the goldens   Dan O, yes there is a slot now.... new this year in zone 10 also  From the QMNR regs: Quote ""One walleye or sauger more than 40 cm length in zone 25 between March 1 and 31 and between May 20 and June 15, 2011 (Note1 )."" Unquote  Zone 10 Quote ""One walleye less than 37 cm or more than 53 cm in length from the following waters (Note1, Note4) : the waters of zones 3 to 12, 21 and 27 excluding the waters of Zec Petawaga (zone 11) and of RÃ©serve faunique Papineau-Labelle (zone 10)"" Unquote"
593327,mercman,2011-06-15 16:09:00,7054,"Yup, we have a slot size in my zone at least.Zone 8, 35 to 53cm we keep, all the rest go back.The 2 shown were 39 and 44cm.  "
593382,bigbuck,2011-06-15 19:13:00,2449,"That looks like one of those Polish Perch lures!! I'm getting snacky as my little one says, gotta get into some 'eyes this weekend."
593487,Billy Bob,2011-06-15 23:24:00,5865,"VERY NICE.....breaking the walleye barrier....not bad....it's all easier after that nice catch....GREAT fish fry this Friday...eh...  Looks like with everything I have been doing here in the back 40 my first (I hope) walleye will come next week sometime by Cliffs....  Again, nice catch and nice perch to boot...  Bob"
