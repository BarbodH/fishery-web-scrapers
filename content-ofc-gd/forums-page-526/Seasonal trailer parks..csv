We are looking for a family oriented park with lots of kid activities (we are raising our 3 year old grandson) We originally wanted to be located on either Upper Buckhorn,Pigeon & Chemong. We're interested in knowing if anyone has any recommendations for any parks in the Kawarthas? Thanks in advance.  Schooner"

They show all the amenities and rate the parks. The kawarthas is Region 8 on their website.  http://www.campgrounds.org/  Region 8 - Map  I've heard a lot of good things about Skyline RV Resort on Chemon. I've never been there but it's on the top of my list to visit.
