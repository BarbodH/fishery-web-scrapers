593298,LucG,2011-06-15 14:35:00,779,"Hey Guys,  Just wondering if anyone knows if the boat launch in Callander will accomodate a small 16' tinner.  Thanks"
593301,Mike01,2011-06-15 14:44:00,378,"Ive launched my 16' deepv there a couple times.  Be advised, it's shallow and there is no dock"
593329,LucG,2011-06-15 16:21:00,779," Great, Thanks! Thats the one just off Park St?"
593343,Mike01,2011-06-15 16:56:00,378,"not sure what the street is, but its right beside the playground where the dirt parking lot is."
593399,Nipfisher,2011-06-15 19:52:00,2449,"Why not use the launch at the old marina? Darlings marina it used to be called. Turn towards the lake at the Callander Tavern and go to the end of the road. Close to where they store the cheif in the winter.  Boat launch is free, tons of parking and the dock is decent. Could easily launch a 20' cruiser there. I'll be launching there tomorrow morning with Joeytier."
593400,Nipfisher,2011-06-15 19:54:00,2449, It is off Lansdowne. Where the royal bank and callander tavern are.
593416,Mike01,2011-06-15 20:19:00,378,"Good call Blair, I never thought of that!"
593624,LucG,2011-06-16 12:11:00,779,"Yeah, the one launch is too shallow for me. Thank Blair, glad I have OFC on my mobile, I was able to change plans on the fly, haha."
593890,Nipfisher,2011-06-17 02:44:00,2449,"  Did you go out today? Joeytier and I were on the bay from 10am - 3 pm and only managed a 14"" keeper walleye and a rock bass. Joey had a pike bite off at boatside and lost something bigger (maybe a drum).  I'll PM you."
