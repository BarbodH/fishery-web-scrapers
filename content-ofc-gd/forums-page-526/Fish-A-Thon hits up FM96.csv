593209,The Urban Fisherman,2011-06-15 02:51:00,2050,"Hey guys!  The morning crew over at FM96 in London offered to hook me up with some air time to talk about the Fish-a-Thon in hopes that we might be able to gain some more interest and support for our cause!!  I'll be on there @ 8:50 ish and you bet I'll be mentioning OFC while I'm on the air!  I'm going to wing it, so hopefully I don't say anything stupid! haha  Anyways it was very generous of them to extend this offer out to me so if you can take a listen for a few minutes! You can listen online if you like as well...  http://www.fm96.com/  Thanks again for all your support!  We've got over 50 people signed up and the support just keeps coming in!  OFC has been a big part of this since day 1 so thanks again!  We'll have a thread set up with full details very soon!  Cheers, Ryan"

Still trying to work out my vacation/work stuff, not sure I'm getting any time off this summer.  Still hoping to fish it but will send a contribution regardless as always. Good luck tomorrow!!"
