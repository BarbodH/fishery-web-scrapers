593318,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 15:37:00,4661,i was wondering if you can cut a transducer wire and put a connector on the wire  im wondering this becaus i need to remove my bow mount trolling motor every night and there is a transducer on it... and the mount for my humminbird doesnt really allow you to disconnect the wire like a lowrance...  so im interested in knowing if i add a connection in the transducer wire will the transducer will still work? and will it be just as sensitive?
593321,Terry,2011-06-15 15:48:00,14456,yes you can   I have cut them and rejoined them and I have cut them and installed shielded rca plugs  never had a problem with them
593331,Fisherman,2011-06-15 16:23:00,7201,"Keep it well above the water line.  There are waterproof TNC and BNC connectors available at electronics shops, Radioworld will probably have them."
593337,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 16:37:00,4661,No issues with sensitivity either?
593354,Terry,2011-06-15 17:27:00,14456,you should make sure you keep it shielded which just means metal breaded cable or tinfoil or shielded connectors ..anything that will wrap it in metal and you will have no issues as said water proof it too
593357,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 17:41:00,4661, ok... so im planning on cutting the wire... crimping on male and female connectors... shrink tubing the connectors... so i guess the most important thing is finding good connectors that are water proof/resistant...  thnx guys
593367,irishfield,2011-06-15 18:09:00,26272,Neither suggested crimp on connectors Mike (although you probably could get away with it). Terry is suggesting RCA plugs.. like the stereo/DVD cords to your TV. Erich is suggested BNC connectors similar to what you'd find on a radio antenna.
593369,Terry,2011-06-15 18:13:00,14456,BNC connectors would work very well I use them for video cables and they lock together so you wouldn't have to worry about them popping off
593376,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 18:46:00,4661,"Ok... So ""the source"" would probably have these type of connectors then?"
593377,Fisherman,2011-06-15 18:50:00,7201,"I'm not quite sure if the Source still carries those items, an electronics repair shop such as those that deal with VHF radios will have them.  BNC or TNC connects are quite acceptable.  Matter of fact I got a TNC for my old bag phone from a Bell Mobile installer."
593378,Terry,2011-06-15 18:51:00,14456,yeah they would  http://www.thesource.ca/estore/Search.aspx?language=en-CA&keywords=bnc+connector&pagenum=0
593393,Roy,2011-06-15 19:28:00,13728,"But if you heat shrink the connection, how will you disconnect it when you remove your bowmount? Am I missing something?"
593395,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 19:33:00,4661,Heat shrink the wire end of the connector... Were the wire enters the connector...  Should help keep water out...  And I think I'm gunna have the connection take place inside a compartment
593402,Fisherman,2011-06-15 19:56:00,7201,"You can get waterproof BNC or TNC connectors, the male/female connection seals with an O ring, same thing that's in the back of your pants."
593406,mike rousseau,2011-06-15 20:00:00,4661,Ok... Thnx
