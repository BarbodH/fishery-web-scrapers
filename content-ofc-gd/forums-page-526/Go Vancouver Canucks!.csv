It really bothers me that this happened.  What about all the people that took their kids to the game and had to fight their way out of downtown Vancouver?   That must have really sucked."
593618,Rod Caster,2011-06-16 11:25:00,5784,"Haha, the rioters should be automatically enlisted into the army. That would stop 'em. Congrats boston, they were by far the better team. Vancouver let this one slip away."
593898,Dan668,2011-06-17 03:38:00,1120,"Sad to see all that rioting. Was expected though, even if they won imo. They couldnt score on Tim Thomas, and Luongo let in all softies as usual.  "

For that to happen it'll take the Sedins to step up (where have they been?) and Luongo to stand on his head. Here's hoping. Go Canucks!! P.S. I'm a Leafs fan and I want the cup in Canada any way possible. "

593381,solopaddler,2011-06-15 19:11:00,8605,Here's what I'm hoping for tonight.  They play a scoreless game and take it to 12 overtime periods with both teams finally collapsing from exhaustion.  Bettman declares neither team truly deserves the cup and for the first time ever it's pronounced a draw.  (Hey it could happen.  )
593389,blaque,2011-06-15 19:21:00,2419,"  Funny thing is, your right, it absolutely could happen. But not with Bobbylou in net"
593390,irishfield,2011-06-15 19:21:00,26272,..or Bettman drops the opening puck and the stick swing takes his head off and ends his nonsense for ever...  Canucks in OT !

Unless you are referring to Bettman, in which case I would easily agree...he is a real C@#$@! (Rooster) However, this having been said, I do know that as far as Rosters go....their are 11 Canadians playing for the Canucks and 17 playing for Boston. We are talking 6 players on a team that does not exist in any Province In Canada that I know of by the name of Massachusetts.  The fact that the Canucks are on this side of the border, easily makes them more Canadian then 6 players playing for the dark side! lol  Ab"
593429,blaque,2011-06-15 20:58:00,2419,You guys think too much.....
593436,jedimaster,2011-06-15 21:18:00,3472,Bruins 5-2 and Loungo gets the hook before the end of the second.
593437,BillM,2011-06-15 21:24:00,17367,Stanley Cup hasn't been decided in OT since '54.  I could go for some of that tonight.
593440,misfish,2011-06-15 21:30:00,29133," One can only wish Wayne.  Bruins 5-2 Go ahead Van fans,burn the city down. Make Montreal proud. No matter what happens. Tims the MVP OF THE PLAYOFFS. Never missed a game or pulled and made it to game 7 in the final.  Tim Thomas MVP. If he dosent get it, win or lose,thats a crying shame."

592811,uglyfish,2011-06-14 01:34:00,981,"I wanna see boston win. I'm a leafs fan, and since boston screwed the draft pic they gave us... They may as well win. And they have more canadian players, and tim thomas deserves it more then anyone for the way he plays!"
592836,knightfisher,2011-06-14 02:22:00,237,Odds alone dictate that Boston will not lose four in a row in Vancouver. Not to mention they were in every game there. Boston without a doubt wins the cup.

592869,dhickey,2011-06-14 03:33:00,1038,So if we ever meet up fishing hockey discusions are out of the question?  I think so.  Kaby is a good solid player and so is chara but the majority of cup winners are primarily based with CANADIAN players. WHY? Because we all grow up dreaming about winning the cup . If your not on the ice your on the road playing street HOCKEY.! Or sitting on a bus.
592870,kickingfrog,2011-06-14 03:35:00,8333,"Someone really needed to tell the bozos in the booth that Seidenberg was sliced by Thomas' skate. How many times did they show the replay? And they still had no clue. ""He grabs his knee, after he bangs it on the ice."" Two villages are missing their idiot. Craig Simpson is the second best sports personality in his family.  I am indifferent to the winner (although the van fans and the commentators are becoming insufferable) I want entertainment, so I am happy with seven games."

592909,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-14 11:49:00,0,"i've heard the argument 1000 times that the team with the most canadians is the canadian team but i honestly couldn't care about the players.  it's a game for the fans, and i'm always rooting for the canadian fans to get the cup. if the number of canadians determined what team was ""more canadian"", none of you bitter leaf fans would even cheer for the leafs.   it's become obvious that leaf nation cheers against every other canadian team and we're fine with that.  we all cheer against you too!"
592941,Grimace,2011-06-14 13:25:00,2020,"I don't care about Canadian players or Canadian teams.  Patriotism is a silly concept (don't get me wrong, I am extremely proud of being Canadian),  I cheer for style of play and personalities.  Neither of these teams excite me, in fact they both put me off a bit.  I would rather Boston win because I despise them less.  Cheering for the Stanley Cup final this year reminds me of voting.  I called Vancouver in seven over Boston in the thread at the start of the playoffs.  I hope I was off and Boston pulls it off.  Edit: Spelling"
592999,blaque,2011-06-14 16:57:00,2419,"Either way ya look at it, the cup will travel to both countries once it is won. Ive tried picking a team to root for the whole series and just cant. So as someone has said earlier........im just glad it became a 7 game series and will just hope for a good close overtime finale.  If i had to pick, i guess id like to see the home team win the trophy. Its always so lame when the away team wins in front of a building full of depressed fans. That NBA final was a joke, you wouldnt have known any of the Mavs just achieved their lifelong dream."

592784,Rod Caster,2011-06-14 00:54:00,5784,"Sure boston has more canadian players, but there are far more canadian fans cheering for Van... Well until the 4th goal.  Anyone else remember Calgary and Edmonton in they last game 7 finals?? Uh oh"
592785,GBW,2011-06-14 00:55:00,8460,I want to say a 9 - 1 final tonight BUT I think 7 - 2.  Roborto doesn't chirp often but he did and look what happened.  He couldn't save a beachball if he tried.
592786,Rod Caster,2011-06-14 00:56:00,5784," Hahaha, why would any team want him after this breakdown... He's a liability"
