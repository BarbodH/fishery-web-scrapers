593632,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-16 12:48:00,4399,Ah yes blown in 75 now that brings back some memories!!!
593668,bigbuck,2011-06-16 14:39:00,2449,"Geez, looking at all that chrome, high rise intakes, blowers, cold air/ram air intakes brings me back. Gotta love cruise nights/car shows in parking lots. I'd love to see Waynes 'Bird some day. If you ever want to dyno it for s's and g's, my buddy has one in Scarborough. It'd be a nice little drive for her to stretch out her legs a bit. Definitely be nice to see a real car on that dyno and not a rice rocket!!! Big Blocks Forever!!!"
593675,GBW,2011-06-16 14:49:00,8460,"Hey Brian, Here's some ""food for thought"" for you one night... http://www.haugensbbq.com/classic_car.htm"
593767,Headhunter,2011-06-16 19:00:00,5703,"Thanks for posting the pics Brian... definately brought back memories... especially the Chevelle SS as my brother had one. His was green with white trim. That thing was a beast... but I would not want to buying gas for it at these prices! LOL He sold it when he got married, to get more of a ""family"" oriented car... and brought home a Buick Grand National! LMAO Ended up trading that for a mini van when my sister in law got preggers! HH"
593774,Terry,2011-06-16 19:18:00,14456,pic photos Brian  no classic car show is complete without a Gremlin and a Bug
593533,misfish,2011-06-16 02:19:00,29133,"Been listening to adverts about a car show in Barrie and thought WTH lets go.  Love the old and improved looks.  Enjoy,we did.                                      That Gremlin was there too.Got to see what was under the hood. Had a great talk with the owner and got invited out to thier place.      When buddy started this up,I thought of our late friend JohnF.

593536,tinbanger,2011-06-16 02:23:00,1028,NICE  good to see a Gemlin again !

593541,misfish,2011-06-16 02:28:00,29133," I must admit Dan,Im learning and was happy with the results.  Thank you.   I want one,but would give me ole lady up for the Dart. SSSSHHHHHHHHHH"
593546,misfish,2011-06-16 02:39:00,29133,Some more                    
593547,BillM,2011-06-16 02:44:00,17367,"Brian, you ever go over to the Burger King on Sat evenings?  I'm hoping one day I see Wayne there with the 'bird!"
593551,mercman,2011-06-16 02:49:00,7054,
593555,irishfield,2011-06-16 02:58:00,26272, LOL... my days are long over of frazzled nerves from letting people scratch my cars at cruise night!
593557,misfish,2011-06-16 03:00:00,29133, Yep been there.Wayne better buff that bird.
593559,misfish,2011-06-16 03:02:00,29133, Give it to me Wayne for a couple of shows. Didnt see to many frazzled owners tonight. Guess they know how to park.
593560,irishfield,2011-06-16 03:02:00,26272,I've buffed my 'bird before... and that's no lie !
593562,Cudz,2011-06-16 03:04:00,2652,Nice.  When was this?  I am a car junkie.  I never even heard about it.  I have a few friends wth some classic.  I am not a ford guy but that fairlane or galaxie with the 427 is beast.  I had a neighbour with an originalfalcon with a 427 and that teardrop hood.  It was a serious ride. That dart is clean but what is up with the vinyl top and flowers.  I have never seen that before.  I hear you Wayne.  When my kids are at the shows I take them aside and tell them 30 tims not to touch anything.  Do not even go near the cars.  If they want to look inside I lift each one up so they can have a look.
593563,misfish,2011-06-16 03:08:00,29133," Tonight Heritage Park.   Could to see you came out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OK. LMAO"
593564,irishfield,2011-06-16 03:10:00,26272,It was rarely the kids cudz...although I did have one ambitious little bugger that pulled himself up to the window to look in and then back down.. with a zipper on his jacket. In general it was usually some jealous zelot with a janitors chain of keys on his belt that would intentional drag them over each corner of every car. I think one of such individuals is still lying unconscious between the trees in Little Lake Park in Midland.... He did about 15 cars before he was dragged into the woods by most of the Georgian Bay car club..
593565,Cudz,2011-06-16 03:11:00,2652,Is it a wednesday thing or a one off?
593566,GBW,2011-06-16 03:13:00,8460,why a Dart when you could have a Deamon...
593568,Cudz,2011-06-16 03:14:00,2652,That is insane!  I don't even own a car like that and I would probably sort someone out for doing that to such awesome cars.  I can't believe someone would do tht intentionally.  Maybe that is why that Rat Rod fad was so popular.  No worries aboutsratching the rusted matt paint jobs.
593570,Cudz,2011-06-16 03:16:00,2652,"Dart was faster.  1969 Plexi windows, fiberglass front, bare bones with a 426.  Demon what?"
593576,misfish,2011-06-16 03:30:00,29133, My pop owned one Cudz. I will get pics when I see them again.
593578,misfish,2011-06-16 03:33:00,29133, Rubbing compound????????   
593593,Cudz,2011-06-16 05:36:00,2652,Very cool.  Our family car from 1970 - 1978 was a Dart swinger with a 340.  My dad used to drag race it on the weekends and my mom would drive it to work. lol.  Poor lady. Sold it in 1978 for $1500 Would love to see the pics Brian.
593598,GlennB,2011-06-16 07:29:00,25,"Hi all Gearheads  I have been to many classic car shows on both sides of the border. This was my love and passion for more years that i care to remember.  On Fathers Day every year Georgetown Ont. has Classics For Cancer at the park.  Great cause and some of the nicest, best restored cars around with something for everyone.  If the wife or girlfriend kicks up a fuss about fishing that day, give it a shot you will not be disappointed.  cheers glenn"
593622,fishindevil,2011-06-16 11:51:00,6254,awesome brian !!! some classics there for sure....
