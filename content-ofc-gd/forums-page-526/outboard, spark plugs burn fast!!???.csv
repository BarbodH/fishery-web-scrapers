593859,Big Cliff,2011-06-17 01:17:00,6899," What do you mean by ""blows the plug""?  Who told you to mix oil with the gas?  What grade of plug are you using?"
593860,Handlebarz,2011-06-17 01:20:00,3790,my old 1962 sea king was 25:1
593881,ecmilley,2011-06-17 02:26:00,2163,"need the year make model for sure, but with most outboard 2 strokes a gas/oil mix as well as the injection is recommended for the first tank just to confirm the oil pump is functioning. I am currently running my engine at a 25:1 ratio for break in and having no issues with any fouling; you have a pic of the plugs do you?"
593927,bigbuck,2011-06-17 12:46:00,2449,"Make sure you are using the correct spark plugs. Consult your owner's manual or contact the manufacturer. I'd go with good quality oil as well, not the cheap stuff, esp. for break in."
