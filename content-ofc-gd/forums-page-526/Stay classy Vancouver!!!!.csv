Cheers to him and the many like him that did not see any reason to act stupid.  The guy in the 40oz shirt needs a cuff in the head or 20.   Those jerks make me sick.   The guy that stopped it rules.

593910,ctranter,2011-06-17 04:57:00,543,"I have a hard time believing that 'terrorists' wore Canucks jerseys (that they bought for this occasion and would never have worn otherwise, i.e. NOT FANS) and caused all of this mayhem.  I understand it is premature to typecast Canuck fans based on the limited media coverage that we see, but anyone argueing that this is NOT disgraceful needs a serious reality check.  Gee, I'm sorry that all of Canada, scratch that, North America (if not the world) thinks the people of VC are hooligans.  It's not like we watched a relatively small city decline into social chaos last night.  Again, any educated person will hastily avoid typecasting all Canuck fans as renegage rioters, but for gods sake how can anyone defend the city of Vancouver?  It's ok guys, someone made a facebook group... Did you see the video of of the guy defending the Bay, who gets pulled into the horde and beaten from all angles?  Was this Al-Quaida, or another 'terrorist' organization?  No.. It was Jim and Suzy from next door.  I'm really sorry your feelings are hurt, City of Vancouver, but quite frankly you look like fools and with good reason.  Enjoy cleaning up after your own babies."

593989,GreenCanada,2011-06-17 17:57:00,375,"I just thought I should throw my two cents in.  1) It was not just young drunken people. 2) They WERE hockey fans and non hockey fans. I'm pretty sure hundreds of anarchists don't go out and spend that kind of cash on vintage Pavel Bure or Trevor Linden hockey jerseys and then forget to cover their faces... 3) It was classless of those that participated, and equally classless of those who stood by watching/cheering/standing around. If those that were not participating just left the area, then 1) the police could have moved in and arrested/beat down the ones participating, or 2) the participators may have calmed down a bit because they didn't have an audience.  To me this doesn't speak to how Canadians are as a whole, but to the poor organizing that led to 100,000 people crammed into a 2-3 block area. It's like giving a child an unlit firecracker in one hand and a match in the other and telling them not to light it on fire. It was going to happen.  It was disappointing to see, but I'm glad no families who were there to watch the game died. It could have been much worse..."

How'd Luongo ever get outta there alive........he must have a Heliport on top of the arena"
594005,NAW,2011-06-17 19:19:00,4022, He's probly still there.  Curled up in a corner shaking..

593716,manitoubass2,2011-06-16 15:57:00,11391,"The fans in the building were definitely respectful from what I seen. I too laughed when the crowd booed Bettman.  Unfortunately acts like this are almost inevitable. I'm sure similar things would happen in any other city.  What I don't understand is when did it become acceptable to celebrate a win, or in this case a loss, in a violent fashion??? At some point this type of action became normal in various sports.  Quick question though, do any of the hooligans get charged with serious crimes? To me destroying parts of your own city is similar to an act of terrorism. Or do they get petty charges, like vandalism???"
593720,BillM,2011-06-16 16:03:00,17367," We agree on that.  With so many camera phones, video and everything else you'd be stupid to be making an ass out of yourself lastnight."

593758,Grimace,2011-06-16 18:16:00,2020,"My buddy wrote this on my Facebook and I find it to be clever, funny, and of value.  Enjoy.   I live in the Greater Vancouver area. Have done for roughly 16 years now since leaving Ontario and I'm beyond embarrassed. What happened last night was inexcusable and unforgivable.  Allow me to let you all in on a little secret West Coasters would prefer the rest of the country doesn't hear: Vancouver sucks. That's right I said it. Vancouver sucks. On the face of things it's a beautiful world class city. Really. The place LOOKS great. No doubt about that. Mountains. Ocean. Lots of 'green' (believe me they LOOOVVVEEE being seen as 'green'!). Lots of beautiful, health-conscious, latte-clutching people running around. A lot of obvious 'Hollywood North'-style wealth being flaunted everywhere you look.  Look deeper through that thin Yuppie veneer though and you'll see the following pretty quickly: Squalor that matches and even eclipses the wealth. Until you've experienced the Downtown Eastside you don't know what skid row looks like. And I say that as someone who also knows T.O., Detroit, Chicago, and Atlanta.There's the drugs and gangs too. Some of the worst and most active violent gangs in the country operate out of Van. You've also never met as many casual and serious drug abusers as you will if you come out here for a year. Add to that incredibly high, almost 'impossible' cost-of-living standards, a corrupt, greedy Provincial government, and some of the higher taxes and unemployment rates we can boast and I for one often find myself wondering just what the damn is the appeal!?!  I see fewer 'peacenik', eclectic, 'laid back', thinking types in Van than I do ruthless Yuppies, testosterone-fuelled jocks, angry 'career protesters', and smarmy, holier-than-thou young professional types. Underneath all of the crap about being a 'world class city' with a welcoming nature is a lot of pent-up rage, snobbery, and wealthy indifference mixed with a smouldering, growing underclass, a rampant drug/crime culture, and a very worried, shrinking middle class. Don't believe the hype. What you saw last night was a very troubled city shedding it's big nose, glasses, and Charlie Chaplin moustache to reveal what always lays simmering underneath."

593768,kickingfrog,2011-06-16 19:01:00,8333,   I contend that very few of the 19000 people inside the arena had anything to do with the mayhem outside on the streets.  And Vancouver lost game 7 in '94 in NYC.
593776,Harrison,2011-06-16 19:23:00,2202,"Stay Classy eh Vancouver, I'm"
593790,Dutchy,2011-06-16 20:25:00,416," Could not agree more. I lived there for 4 years and I was back last week for a conference and it has changed even within 4 years. Very violent undertones there particularly downtown. I was downtown when they won game 2 of the SC and the atmosphere turned on a dime. You felt that something could kick off at any time. Not cool at all.  Vancouver is not a great place to live. For the reasons above. What happened last night was disgraceful and there were more than a ""few"" canucks fans involved. And fans were involved for sure."

593803,blarg,2011-06-16 21:02:00,289,"Vancouver and Montreal are the most lefty, liberal, and progressive cities in the country, do you think maybe the type of undisciplined and anarchistic type of environment fosters this sort of behavior? I do.  Not only did they riot, people are bragging about it on facebook..just what kind of society are we building here and does anyone think that this would have happened the way it did a few decades ago...with people feeling free to be photographed and openly brag about it?  That is what happens in a society where there are few if any consequnces."
593804,Grimace,2011-06-16 21:08:00,2020, What nonsense.  Complete drivel.  Do you know what progressive means?  Would you like a more reactionary world?   Mindless babble.
593806,Dutchy,2011-06-16 21:22:00,416," Unfortunately you are right. Anyone who looks for 30 mins on facebook or even on Global BC will see people really not giving a rats ass about being photographed. Teenagers, people in there early twenties, smashing cars, including one pic of a guy lighting the gas tank on a police car. They don't care, cause even if they are caught they will get a slap on the wrist, nothing more. There is something seriously wrong nowadays with the youth."

593640,scugpg,2011-06-16 13:31:00,1373,To see all of that on camera last night was disgusting. Not a highlight to be Canadian. Some on the news kept mentioning bars and booze but I suspect a few of them were on much more than a few drinks...

And you know what that would have happened even if the canucks would have won the game!!!  The fuzz should be looking at the video very carefully to identify as many as the punks as they can so the law can deal out a little payback of their own.  I weep for the future!!!"

If so, ther gang attire is a strange choice what with all the Vancouver hockey jerseys and capes, and sponge hockey puck hats."
593658,Joey,2011-06-16 14:22:00,9122,I saw on the news this morning they have a Facebook page where the police are requesting you submit your photos of the riot so they can possibly identify the vandals and morons to charge them!!!

593670,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 14:42:00,0,I don't see why an entire city is held responsible for the actions of a few but if knee-jerk reaction and over-reacting is your thing then be my guess.  These things are typically organized by anarchist groups looking to intentionally ruin something the general populace holds dear... aka hockey!
593674,BillM,2011-06-16 14:47:00,17367, I guess you missed the bottles thrown at Chara when he received the cup?  Act of holigans as well?  Give me a break.
593680,4x4bassin,2011-06-16 15:03:00,1025,"I some what agree with you that all the people from Vancouver shouldn't be painted with the same brush here but these acts by a select few idiots will result in Vancouver's image being tarnished , thats just the way it is !"

Thats gotta be good for a few years in a cell.  If I'm the NHL Vancouver is going to be punished to some degree, I have no idea how though?"
593693,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 15:21:00,0," I also saw an arena full of people stick around to cheer when Boston received the cup as well as when Thomas received the Connie.  The bulk of the ill will I saw was directed at Bettman, which he probably deserves.  Like I said, you're applying the actions of a few to all.  If you think Toronto would be different you're gullible.  There's  's  there too!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32OW6cu4Ypk"

593701,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 15:36:00,0,"I am on topic. A few drunk frat boys and some hippy punk anarchist types do not reflect the overwhelming majority of the population, and every city in Canada has them.  I hope those responsible are nailed to the wall."
593703,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 15:38:00,0,Personally I thought Vancouver was quite classy in the way they handled the loss.
593707,12footspringbok,2011-06-16 15:48:00,459, I have to agree. IF (LOL) Toronto ever made it to the cup and had the same out come I'm almost positive there would be tards in the streets doing the same thing.
593712,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 15:55:00,0," It's unfortunate, but true. And I'm not worried about Vancouver's image, the city will be fine.  My concern is about the safety of the majority not involved and how they shouldn't feel embarrassed for their city but angry for those responsible."
593713,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 15:56:00,0,"I think if anyone should be embarrassed, maybe it's Luongo and the Sedins!"
