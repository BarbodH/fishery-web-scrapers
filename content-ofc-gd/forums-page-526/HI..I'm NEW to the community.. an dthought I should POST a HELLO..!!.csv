Geoff and I TRY and get out on Four Mile Lake( Burnt River/Bobcaygeon area ) as much as we can. My HOME is in Hastings, as RICE is the 5 minute EASY FIX when I get the shakes..  Have been out 5 X already this early season and have been meeting with Avg. sucess. Gearing up for MUSKIE Hunting and already have ordered some COWGIRLS from Mike P. ( Thanks Mike loving the Purple flashed ULTRAlite BTW.. ) and a LOVE getting out Rain or SHine. Thanks for all the Update posts RE: conditions and choices of tackle et all. Hope to have some stories and pics too.  Peace Out Dave"
