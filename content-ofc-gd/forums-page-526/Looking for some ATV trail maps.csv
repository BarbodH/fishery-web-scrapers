593540,Paudash,2011-06-16 02:27:00,273,I just bought a couple of ATV's and and I am looking for some trail maps if anyone could send me a link.  Also if you know of some fun to get to lakes in the Bancroft area that you are willing to share that would be great

593600,Big Cliff,2011-06-16 09:26:00,6899,Go to www.kawarthaatv.com they have all sorts of trail maps and links. They also offer guided rides which would be a super way to introduce you to the trail system in this area.
