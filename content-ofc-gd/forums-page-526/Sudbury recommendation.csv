592888,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-14 05:48:00,479,I'm in Sudbury at the moment and would like to fish out of Ramsey Lake this Wednesday. Does anyone have a marina to recommend on renting a boat for few hours?  Thanks!
593260,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-15 12:05:00,479,I was able to speak to a local tackle shop owner and he said that there are no marinas for public boat rentals. Just in case someone else was wondering.
