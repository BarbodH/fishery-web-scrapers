Two of the best scoring players in the league this year combin for 5 points in 7 games.  Disgraceful!!! Great job by Boston.  Grinded their way to the championship.  Fun to watch and I was cheering for them tonight.  woohoo!

593626,pics,2011-06-16 12:15:00,1268,They had about the same number of Canadian players but Vancouver relied on europeans for their top lines....they got hit and it threw them off their game....Thomas played brilliantly while luongo was inconsistant.........

"" they rode him to the end "" Yeah they did.... but they also scored over 20 goals in 7 games.  I have been cheering for Boston since game 1, and the reason for that was proven last night by the Canuck fans and there rediculous actions after the game ! The only city I have ever seen that cheers when there goalie is pulled. UNREAL !!!!   Welp... hockey is over.... Fishing season is in FULL swing ! ..... LETS GO WINGS !!!!!"
