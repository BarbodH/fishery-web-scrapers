The ""usual"" late start with the kids in tow...but by 7am lines were in the water....just to find it is a rather cold water at that.... and almost no hooks on the screen.....so I knew it'll be tough time trying to find the warmer water with hooks in it....got few large kings while searching for better temps....let them go as they were too big  (18 and 19 Lbs)....covered lots of water and further West I went warmer it got....and the bite eventually started after 10am....off the lake by 12:30....score for the days 8 for 12....hits on dipsy (wire with fly, and braid with spoon) and on the riggers....only one hit on the leadcore....  wire was out 115' over 150, and braid 130 over 150....most of the day was between 100 and 160 fow but most hits were 140-150 fow.... some serious hits on both dipsys.....almost went in the drink with the wire dipsy ....  Mixed bag - Kings, Cohos and Bows....let most bigger Kings and bows go to get bigger....kept a few for the smoker....  Kids were happy even though they've had hard time fighting some of the bigger fish....had to work in team to manage ha ha ha  Few shots from the day:                Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
