593392,Roy,2011-06-15 19:24:00,13728,Sorry folks...extremely busy here. I will turn it up a notch or two. I guess some of the newer members have not read the rules. It's a pretty bad state of affairs when you need rules to keep people civil.
593404,John,2011-06-15 19:58:00,2956," No worries Roy, we can make a citizens arrest once in a while when the keepers of the peace are otherwise engaged..."
593432,Big Cliff,2011-06-15 21:03:00,6899,"Kudos to anyone who helps stop poaching in any way be it a phone call to the authorities or laying charges if you are in the position to do so. Perhaps if the poaching stopped there would be less anamosity toward the people who seem to be doing the poaching.  As for the gill netting, if you don't like the laws that allow it then do something to change them. Otherwise respect the rights of those that are operating within the law."
593434,misfish,2011-06-15 21:07:00,29133, Do the same rules apply at Lakair??????? LMAO.

593445,Big Cliff,2011-06-15 21:35:00,6899," Oh please no! Not the old fishing stories!!!!!  I'll be good, I promise!"
593449,misfish,2011-06-15 21:44:00,29133,"  I love old stories of others catching in the 1940,s."

593518,mercman,2011-06-16 02:05:00,7054,"  Wouldnt have it any other way DanBesides, All the troublemakers are gone to lakeair"
593809,misfish,2011-06-16 21:32:00,29133," Not yet,,,,,,,,,,,"
593810,GBW,2011-06-16 21:36:00,8460,and I'm not going there either...
593815,mercman,2011-06-16 22:14:00,7054, Did ya pack enough liquid gold Brian
593822,misfish,2011-06-16 22:54:00,29133,"Just enough for me, and all my friends."
593894,Nipfisher,2011-06-17 03:02:00,2449,"Getting this thread back on track........  Myself and Joeytier were appoached by OPP in their jet boat today on Callander Bay. They were polite and asked to see our licences (not check the stickers only see the cards).  They had no interest in my boaters card....why do we need it if Police dont care?  They asked to see my safety kit but didn't ask to see if the lash light worked or if I had a whistle, etc. Just having the orange bucket was good enough. I believe I need to have flares too...which I dont.  They asked for my fire extinguisher (because I have a built in tank) but never asked for life jackets??? which I showed him.  They never asked about alcohol or if we had a cooler?  They never asked how the fishing was? They didn't care if we had slot sizers or oos fish which of couse we didn't.  They were not overly friendly but also did not waste much of our time.  Maybe it was the OFC sticker on my windshield????"
593899,OutdoorDan,2011-06-17 03:38:00,325,"I think they just randomly pick things to ask, it would take to long to go through everything. Just imagine: fishing license, ID, boater card, whistle, rope, propelling device/anchor with rope, flares, fire extinguisher, life jackets, fish in livewell, alcohol, compass... the list goes on. Chances are, if you have the orange bucket, you have the other stuff that is in it and so forth. Also, they might just be good judges of character and had you gotten nervous or snappy with them, they may have then felt the need to make sure you have all the details."
593904,crossover,2011-06-17 04:27:00,172,I don't want to derail the topic (too late) but I was fishing a couple of days ago and was asked by some young person on a bicycle to show my license. Can someone other than OPP and COs fine you? (btw I did have mine...)
593905,manitoubass2,2011-06-17 04:30:00,11391," No. Ask him for his bicycle license next time, and make sure he's wearing a helmet"
593990,GreenCanada,2011-06-17 18:09:00,375," I'll pretend you're being serious, because I agree, thank goodness they punished someone for taking more fish than allowed under the regulations they agree to adhere to when purchasing a fishing license. Don't like the lake littered with gill nets (  ) as you so eloquently put it, why not take the fishing pressure you exert while on the lake and put it to use on a different lake? Then you won't have to worry about getting all bothered by something you have no control over.  All in all, I love hearing about poachers getting what they deserve!!"
593284,Mike01,2011-06-15 14:06:00,378,"I know everyone likes to hear these kinda things so I thought I'd share the story with you.  My buddy was on shift last week and took a ride out on the government dock(King's Landing), being an avid fisherman he was chatting with a few of the guys to see how they were making out.  When he approached one of these ""gentleman"" the guy didn't want to talk or answer any questions.  My bud thought this was a little strange and asked to see his fishing license.  The man responded with a few F-bombs and other choice words and told him that he wasn't the MNR so he couldn't do anything.  BIG mistake, he nailed him for having six walleye and two of them were slot fish!  He told me they actually have a guide book they keep in the cruisers that lists all the charges for illegally fishing and hunting.  It's good to know that there are more than just CO's protecting our resources cause lord knows there aren't enough of them, especially up in these parts."
593287,Headhunter,2011-06-15 14:14:00,5703,Nice work there Mike... kudo's to your friend for steppin up...the lake can use all the help it can get! HH
593288,baal,2011-06-15 14:18:00,16, These guys should be put into jail. Your buddy did an excellent job! I am curious where are these fools from?
593290,NAW,2011-06-15 14:22:00,4022,    Good on him for doing that.  I don't know to many cops that would have done that.  Around here anyways.
593293,misfish,2011-06-15 14:26:00,29133,Mods are at lakair. LOL  Mistakes happen. Im sure it wont happen again.  Thanks for sharing Mike.
593295,Gerritt,2011-06-15 14:29:00,6129,I am sure Dan will be working overtime this week....
593297,John,2011-06-15 14:33:00,2956," LOL, not yet they're not.."
593300,Mike01,2011-06-15 14:42:00,378,"The guy was a local.  Lol, how did that get through!"
593306,manitoubass2,2011-06-15 14:55:00,11391,"Good on your buddy for doing his job.  For those who don't know, all police officers in Ontario are trained CO's, or at least according to the MNR website.  Yes, a police officer can and will enforce fish and game laws, as proven right here!!!"
593313,blarg,2011-06-15 15:09:00,289,"Thank goodness, after all, punishing someone who bought a license for keeping fish in the slot will surely protect the fish stocks on lake littered with gill nets."
593314,kennyman,2011-06-15 15:12:00,737,Glad to hear it. Most cops are good guys. I'm glad this one stepped up and nailed that piece of crap. I wish it would happen more often. 
593315,Mike01,2011-06-15 15:13:00,378,  seriously.....?
593316,Terry,2011-06-15 15:17:00,14456, Lame  we have to start somewhere
593320,fishindevil,2011-06-15 15:41:00,6254,well good for him !!! thats good news for a change...cheers
593323,Flappn,2011-06-15 16:01:00,245,"You either have to be very new to the country or just down right ignorant to go fishing with out a Lic and also keeping slot fish. I don't know about you, but I would not be having a good time fishing if I new I was fishing illegally. Do people not worry? right and wrong is one thing...but my conscious would not allow me to fish without a lic."
593332,irishfield,2011-06-15 16:25:00,26272,He's got better things to do during the day.. like chase 30 kids vs the 2000 here.  Guess who has Wi Fi now.
593336,coreyhkh,2011-06-15 16:34:00,163,Awesome.
593342,fishing n autograph,2011-06-15 16:56:00,2540, Hey can your buddy snag one of those guides for me? I've never seen one nor have I been provided one and for me to find out the approproate charge and wording would involve a lengthy call to the mnr! I'd love to tag some of these guys
593344,Mike01,2011-06-15 16:59:00,378,"  I can ask him, I'm not sure who has produced them, whether it's his department or a government agency."
593347,GBW,2011-06-15 17:11:00,8460,Is he OPP or local agency?
593349,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-15 17:15:00,0,"hah... blarg is kind of an    and as far as he's concerned everything is the natives fault.  i'll say what i always say...  those who are first to point the finger are often some of the worst resource abusers and they don't realize that when they point the finger, there's a few more pointing back at themselves.  great to hear that your chum is looking out for the resource regardless of what badge he has.  cheers!"
593360,kickingfrog,2011-06-15 17:45:00,8333,"I used language like that once, I didn't have the time to sensor myself and was courious to see what I thought was an automatic program would turn my phrase into. I was a very suprised to see that it went unchanged right to the board.  It did serve its purpose by drawing attention to what I thought was an offensive statement.  Not one of my finer moments. I did also receive a pm from a mod about my behaviour as well."
593372,Whopper,2011-06-15 18:29:00,2174, Maybe YOU ought to edit your own post...just saying
