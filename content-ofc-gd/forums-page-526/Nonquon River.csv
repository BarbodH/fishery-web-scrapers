593373,ty1on,2011-06-15 18:33:00,12,I joined this forum a few years back when I moved onto Lake Scugog and have been fishing it regularly.  But now I want to try a few new places on my canoe.  Has anyone fished the Nonquon River that feeds into Lake Scugog?  I was hoping to go west of the bridge in Seagrave.  If so any particular baits that work well?  I am a catch and release guy.  Ty

I lived in port perry for 14 years and fished it regularly. as far as lures go. id say beetle spins with a grub or t-tail. not once have they let me down. any other questions, feels free to send me an inbox.  hope any of this helped a fellow angler. -Alex"
