593172,baironhorse,2011-06-15 01:00:00,145,"Yes another battery question: I baught an 27class interstate last Sept 2010 and used it approx 5 times and kept it mainted througjout winter...the battery is stamped Aug 2010 so it was a fresh one when I baught it....as I am upgrading my TM from 12v to 24v I plan to run a 2 battery system wired in a series...My question is as I need another battery, I was going to buy the exact same battery only difference it will be alot newer. Will the age difference in batteries (although minor IMO) affect the series once wired up? Will the weaker battery cause a weak link?"
593175,landry,2011-06-15 01:14:00,1005,No worries.

593189,baironhorse,2011-06-15 02:10:00,145,Ok cool...so Im good to go then with adding same battery? 
593198,Fishnwire,2011-06-15 02:35:00,983,Go for it.  If your older battery was borderline (ready or nearly ready to be replaced) then I would buy two new ones...but if there's nothing wrong with it...there's nothing wrong with it.
593206,baironhorse,2011-06-15 02:48:00,145,right on! thks guys
