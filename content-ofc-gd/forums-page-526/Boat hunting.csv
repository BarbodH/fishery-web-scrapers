593591,Guest LivingLegend,2011-06-16 04:50:00,0,"Im checking out a 2010 Crestliner 1850 Canadian tomorrow. Its basically the boat, 115 Merc hp, trailer and four seats. Could possibly have it for just over $20,000 taxes/fees included. Any advice? gonna see the condition but it looks good from the pics. I checked out other Crestliners and they seem to be high 20's mid 30's. Wish me luck........"

593697,SmokestackLightnin,2011-06-16 15:32:00,390,You should also look into the cost of changing your OFC handle from LivingLegend to LivingCrestliner.
593714,Terry,2011-06-16 15:56:00,14456,the price seems great
593732,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-16 16:36:00,1351,The max rating is 175hp.. wouldn't the 115 be a bit under-powered?
593748,misfish,2011-06-16 17:49:00,29133,Go with the 150.
593829,Guest LivingLegend,2011-06-16 23:36:00,0,"  LOL, good one"
593830,Guest LivingLegend,2011-06-16 23:37:00,0,  They come with 115 to 175. I think it should be ok......
593840,Mike the Pike,2011-06-17 00:14:00,3421,Seriously upgrade the motor the 115 is not going to cut it on an 18 foot boat .Pay now or you will be paying in the near future .Find out how much more it probably won't make a difference in your budget.A bigger motor does not have to be run full throttle .Think about it.There are members of this board who have been down that road.
593858,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-17 01:10:00,4399,Check out boattest.com there is a good review on the 1850!
593909,Guest LivingLegend,2011-06-17 04:44:00,0," That is a good review which is the reason why I think $20000 final is a pretty fantastic price on 2010Crest-Liner, even if its just a 115hp. Alot different opinions and I thank all."
