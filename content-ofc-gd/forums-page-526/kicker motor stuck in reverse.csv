Throttle at console was freely movng as well and moving the motor lever no problem. Really head scratching. I have a 115 and the 8.8 connected w/ the same linkage and separate throttles at the console. Is there a quick fix to this or am I bound for a trip to my mechanic? Thanks to all who respond."
