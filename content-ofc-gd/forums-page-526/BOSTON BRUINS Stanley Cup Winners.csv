593801,blaque,2011-06-16 20:46:00,2419," Two things in your post almost made me throw up in my mouth a little.........Baseball, and the New England Patriots"
593802,Billy Bob,2011-06-16 20:48:00,5865, And you consider yourself a Blue Blood American....not get in the back yard and start throwing the baseball around to your wife...and don't duck when she throws it back too hard....
593805,blaque,2011-06-16 21:13:00,2419," Ya mean pack a chew, have a seat, and maybe gear up to run a base a couple times a game..........maybe have to cowboy up and catch a ball once or twice. Id have more fun doign a Sudoku puzzle."
593807,Billy Bob,2011-06-16 21:23:00,5865," In all actuality Baseball takes the most talent to play.....your at the plate all by yourself trying to hit a 98 mph fast ball or will it be a curve ball or maybe a slider but possibly a split finger that dive into the ground just as you swing or maybe a change up and you swing well before it even reaches the plate and you look like a idot....when you fail to get a hit you have no other player on your team to blame....you didn't Git 'R Done.....but when you do make a play at the plate ""YOUR"" the hero of the day....  BTW it's a MUCH MORE complicated game then it looks from a non-baseball fan.....if it's a close game it becomes a chess game via the manager starting in the 7th inning but if you're not a fan you would never understand."
593808,blaque,2011-06-16 21:31:00,2419,just razzin......i know there's talent involved. Theres obviously some sort of draw based on the amount of people who like it. As you said.........i just dont get it thats all. Im gaga over hockey and you arent........same thing.
593816,express168,2011-06-16 22:27:00,327,"Yeah BRUINS! Thomas carried them and Luongo dropped the Canucks. I like Luongo personally, but his firepower upfront didn't put it in the net plain and simple. You cannot win without scoring."
593826,muskymike,2011-06-16 23:29:00,772,"I would have to say Thomas could have played one of the best single season and playoffs in NHL history.  I am not a fan of Boston at all, but Thomas was and this is an understatement, Incredible!!! I don't know if we will see another goalie perform like that in the next generation or 2. Unless he does it again next year.  Well done Boston.  I still think Vancity is 10x more talented then Boston could ever be, but if you cant score when it matters, talent means nothing."
593856,jediangler,2011-06-17 01:06:00,1923,Baseball is for people who can't skate.  :blahblah1:
593863,Rod Caster,2011-06-17 01:23:00,5784," Yup, Thomas put up some incredible numbers all year, AND won a cup. A great accomplishment to say the least"
593886,tb4me,2011-06-17 02:36:00,3295,"HA HA this is soo funny..To me anyway.. This guy got what he deserved  <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_DiVW8ohIiM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
593919,Billy Bob,2011-06-17 11:31:00,5865," Ya, your right...."

593552,umKthxbye,2011-06-16 02:49:00,247,"You mean Boston Bruins, carried by Tim Thomas Stanley cup winners."
593571,corvette1,2011-06-16 03:18:00,1765,ya baby awesome win
593574,kickingfrog,2011-06-16 03:21:00,8333,You'd think a goalie had never played a big role in his team winning the cup.  :blahblah1:
593585,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-16 03:58:00,1622,"I would have loved to see Vancouver win it but they didn't deserve to Win, Boston did Congrats to the American's that had enough sense to put the Canadian boys together on the Bruins Team it Paid OFF BIG TIME lol SBK"
593586,jediangler,2011-06-16 04:05:00,1923,"When you are 6yrs old and your team wins the cup and then they do it again when you're 8, you think that they'll win it every second year. I've been waiting 39 long years for this one and it feels GREAT. Vancouver fans know that you have to score more than 8 goals in 7 games to win the cup. Not to worry though, Recchi and Lucic will be bringing the cup home to the left coast some time this summer."
593611,Grimace,2011-06-16 10:52:00,2020," Congrats, it must feel good for your team to win the cup.  Hopefully I can see that one day.  I noticed you were not yapping too much during the playoffs, that shows you have better sense than Roberto Luongo.  Lol."
593615,Billy Bob,2011-06-16 11:17:00,5865,  
593625,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 12:13:00,0,the more deserving team won.  vancouver are gutless.  8 goals in 7 games or something... pathetic.  and it seems Tim Thomas picked the right time to play the best hockey of his career.  Congrats on the Connie!
593627,Lungelarry,2011-06-16 12:20:00,294,"I have been a Bruins fan (especially tough here in Montreal) since I was 10years old,that's 44 years now. Two Cups in my life , its like I've  won the Jackpot. Today is a GREAT DAY to go Fishing"
593634,blaque,2011-06-16 13:01:00,2419," I hate boston, lol...........but this comment makes no sense.  Would you hold it against your team if they won the cup because their goaltender played lights out????  Dont forget the guys up front scored 23 in 7 games (something like that)"
593635,Harrison,2011-06-16 13:03:00,2202,"Damn, I pvr'ed it.  Thanks."
593666,anders,2011-06-16 14:34:00,1168,One of the happiest days of my life!  Speechless actually!
593692,Headhunter,2011-06-16 15:21:00,5703,"Did anyone else laugh out loud when Bettman presented the cup to Chara and we got to see what that little weasle looked like, standing beside a hockey giant! He looked more like a weasle then ever before. I also got a chuckle out of the Vancouver fans booing Bettman, thoughout his entire speech... I guess the only folks who like Bettman are the club owners! Fishheadjoe"
593702,davis,2011-06-16 15:36:00,128, not really. pretty classless. what gripe do canucks fans have with him?
593719,Beans,2011-06-16 16:02:00,3339,"...Too Late !!! My prayer for the Canucks                       Our Father, who art in Rogers Arena, Hockey be thy name.     Thy will be done, the cup will be won, on ice, as well as in the stands.     Give us this day, our hockey sticks, & forgive us our penalties,     as we forgive those who cross-check against us.     Lead us not into elimination, but deliver us to victory.     In the name of the fans,     in the name of Lord Stanley,     in the name of the CANUCKS.     AMEN!!!  "
593723,Headhunter,2011-06-16 16:05:00,5703,This... for the win! HH
593724,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-16 16:08:00,0,"I definitely laughed.  Hey GM's, and ownership, take a hint."
593727,GBW,2011-06-16 16:21:00,8460,Prior to the 1st game of the season I had been saying Boston would win and as much as I don't like Z I'm glad they won.   
593736,Billy Bob,2011-06-16 16:51:00,5865,But the better season is at full throttle.....B A S E B A L L  GO RED SOX ....  :clapping:  I don't like the NE Patriots but Boston could possibly go for the Trifecta this year. Stanley Cup  World Series   and the Super Bowl...
593754,John,2011-06-16 18:00:00,2956, Yeah but this Stanley Cup win is for season gone not coming............
593755,John,2011-06-16 18:01:00,2956, Not a revelation guys.............. playoff hockey is all about hot goalies!
593764,Flappn,2011-06-16 18:41:00,245,Thomas played very well but don't discount the Boston players. Goals have to get scored...I didn't see Thomas score a goal.
593789,Billy Bob,2011-06-16 20:24:00,5865, Thomas didn't score any goals....TRADE HIM...Ha ha ha ha....just kidding....I watch most of the game yesterday at the fire hall....now I'm by far a hockey expert...but it seemed to me that Vancouver out played them but Boston out scored them....the puck was always in the Boston end....or am I way off point here...not really much of a hockey fan.  Bob
593795,mercman,2011-06-16 20:37:00,7054,  way too funny.
