593106,boatman,2011-06-14 22:14:00,350,I was talking to a guy from Environment Canada today in Meaford. He said some idiot(s) broke into the Bighead river stream gauge and stole $5000 worth of specialized water level monitoring equipment last month. He said the equipment is so specialized that it has no resale value. So now we tax payers get to foot the bill for this senseless act of vandalism.
