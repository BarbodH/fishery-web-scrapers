593200,Rod Caster,2011-06-15 02:37:00,5784,"What a beautiful day today! Low winds, high sun and no work. I mapped out a new lake just 30 minutes north of town that Fish-Online indicated it held walleye--- they aren't always correct, but I figured they were right this time since this very small lake is attached to bigger lake known to contain walleye. I ate a balogna and hot sauce sandwich at the launch, starred down this 70 hectare lake and launched the canoe at 3:30.  Paddled and drifted for about an hour when I got my first bite!    She was 57cms long, 3 shy of the 60cms slot limit. ... don't go by the tape reading in the photo hahaha    I paddled nearly the whole shoreling, dragging and popping white maribou jigs tipped with minnows off the bottom, in 8-14 feet of stained water.      At one point the bottom livened up and my 3/8 oz jig was bouncing on rocks; as soon as I felt the rocks a big perch smashed my jig. ...new perch PB!!! 14 inches and full of crayfish. I kinda screwed up by taking a measurment shot and not displaying my TEAM 8 OFC Tourny Logo.. Minutes later I cleaned them and go 4 walleye sized filets. Sorry Team 8, but I am NOT going down the garbage shoot to recover the carcass.      Well, that was my day. Tomorrow is Vac day #2 and my GF is joining! Can't wait."

593488,Rod Caster,2011-06-15 23:29:00,5784," Yes it does. I fished another small lake further north today and only got a few pike. Beautiful weather made it all worth the effort!  Solo: only premium ingredients for this paddler hehe  Manitou; I didn't notice any blue, probably just the pic. That would have been neat though.  Mike01: franks indeed..xtra hot!  Slayer: don't worry; I don't think anybody has lost the OFC tourney because of just a few inches... Right? Hehe uh oh"
