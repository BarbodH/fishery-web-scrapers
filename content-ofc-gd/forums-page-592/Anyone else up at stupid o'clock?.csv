536953,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 11:57:00,2540,My rant is over...waking up really early bites and I mean earlier than Lew o'clock...  This is posted almost 4 hours after the alarm went off  Dave
536954,Handlebarz,2011-01-09 12:00:00,3790,Dave 3-4am was the original Lew O'clock. But no for some odd reason I slept in today and did not get up until 6am it was kinda weird.  Hope you were up just because you were excited to get out fishing or something cool like that.  Well its off to the shop time to tie some lures hope yer day goes better.  Cheers Mike
536955,cheaptackle,2011-01-09 12:04:00,849,Work for me too - off to try & sell some of what Mike is making (should try & get some of yours on the shelf Mike!).  This working for a living sure interferes with fishing!  Michael
536956,Woodsman,2011-01-09 12:04:00,1286,Hell I work straight midnights. I'm always up at odd times.
536958,Rich,2011-01-09 12:05:00,3927,"Up between 4 and 5 everyday, work or not. Live the butcher life! lol"
536959,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 12:06:00,2540,"Yep, up for work....and its cold old -15 with the windchill"

536962,pikehunter,2011-01-09 12:13:00,1659,"Been up for awhile. First day back to work after vacation, haven't been on the floor since Dec. 20th/10. Ya you got it...I'm really looking forward to getting back to it If I ever get around to downloading the pictures I'll post some of them."
536966,lew,2011-01-09 12:44:00,12766,"I've been retired goin on 11 years now and I'm still up every morning between 2 and 4 0'clock as it's definetely the nicest time of day.  When I was working, the firehall I worked outta the last 25 years was only a mile from home yet I'd still hop on my bike about 3 A.M. and log anywhere from 10-30 miles before heading into work and I'd do that 12 months of the year, course when there was a foot of snow on the road I may not go quite as far."
536972,Fishnwire,2011-01-09 13:07:00,983,Just got off a nightshift.  Between 5 and 6 when I'm about to get off I can barely keep my eyes open.  Once I get home I don't feel like going to bed.  I really should do that right now.
536986,Woodsman,2011-01-09 14:18:00,1286,How I know that feeling.
