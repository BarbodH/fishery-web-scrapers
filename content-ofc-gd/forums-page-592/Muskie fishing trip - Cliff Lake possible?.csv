537243,catmanjake,2011-01-10 01:05:00,1,3 guys looking to do some muskie fishing in July.  One person mentioned heading to Cliff Lake and staying at resort there for a few days.  Anyone ever fished Cliff Lake for muskies?  Any other ideas on lakes/resorts to check out? Would like to keep search to around no more than 4 hours north of International Falls. Thanks for any thoughts/info you can give me.

I suggest taking a look through the search engine on this website or the e-magazine also offered by this website for all your musky fishing in NW-Ontario. bNb"

He's a member here and a great friend of mine.  he guides musky on lac seul in sioux lookout.  there are some absolute monsters in lac seul!!!  if you do a search on here for ""lac seul musky"" you will see a couple musky that i caught with ben this fall.  Ben is an awesome guy and a very knowledgable guide."
537364,grt1,2011-01-10 06:45:00,638,"Ok guys, I have heard that Cliff lake has muskies, in fact one of my friends used to have a camp on Cliff and he told me it was the best kept secret about muskies in the area. That said, a year or two ago I saw a Fishn Canada show they did on the Indian Lake chain (near Vermilion Bay) and they had a lot of musky catches on camera, then again there's Eagle Lake and Wabigoon that are prime musky lakes.  Cliff Lake is also a great lake trout lake.(and bass too), but I've never gone down the road to try it so i'm just going on hearsay from friends."
