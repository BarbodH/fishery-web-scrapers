536888,12footspringbok,2011-01-09 03:04:00,459,How many K's on it? Looks to be in pretty good shape. Makes ice fishing that much easier and more fun.
536896,thebigcatch,2011-01-09 03:16:00,138, Only 8000 k on it!
536901,limeyangler,2011-01-09 03:22:00,5204, Awesome little machine...looks pretty much mint for the year....good deal right there!  I have been wondering whether to get a little fan cooled 340 too...but up here an old beat up Elan goes for around $  1500
536911,Old Man,2011-01-09 03:41:00,822,"Looks like a excellent buy.  Be careful on the ice this year, there's a lot of dodgy spots in some areas."
