536514,jeffw,2011-01-08 16:57:00,267,I tried it but stripped it off after 1st use. Too much memory for my liking. Back to berkley line. Cheers Jeff

536601,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-08 19:46:00,2690, Seems to be a common problem with a bunch of the so called ice lines.  Thanks for the input.
536658,Muskieman,2011-01-08 21:28:00,2472,Trilene XL here...  no problems yet 20 years +  I have no reason to try anything else
536662,irishfield,2011-01-08 21:31:00,26272,I jumped to the ice lines at first.. found them (mono) to be crap. If you need the blue to see your line.. that's all they are good for. I went back to the same Trilene I fish with in the summer in 6 and 8 lb depending on the targeted species and I have one rod with Powerpro ice on it for in the hut when fishing deep.

536769,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-09 00:14:00,0, amen brother.
536855,Leecher,2011-01-09 02:17:00,7832,Never tried Northland so can't comment on it..... I use Power Pro Ice for my jigging rod and Dacron on the tipups.  Leechman
