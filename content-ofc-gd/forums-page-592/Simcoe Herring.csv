536030,aplumma,2011-01-07 19:59:00,6896, Actually the icefishing is very good down here. I have found if you use 2 fingers instead of your thumb you will fit in the glass and can reach the ice easier.   Art
536034,misfish,2011-01-07 20:05:00,29133,"   Like oldphart said,you could catch them by the bushel. I was one that did keep alot of them.  As for HH.  I would gut,scale and split them in half.Rub with pepper and salt and broil them so thier pretty much dried out. I ate alot of them,and if they do open them back up,like Andy and I were discussing today,theres got to be a limit put on them.  The simcoe population is huge right now.Not like the numbers back in the 70,s but is up there.I say keep them closed for another couple of years."
536051,Terry,2011-01-07 20:43:00,14456,I remember when they would drive up to pressure cracks with their pickup trucks full of 45 gal drums and they would stay till everyone of them were full  we need a small limit on them when they open again
536069,irishfield,2011-01-07 21:16:00,26272,What.. you can't keep them..    
536072,Terry,2011-01-07 21:18:00,14456,you're asking me? I can't even catch em  LOL  can keep them on a hundred other lakes
536074,misfish,2011-01-07 21:20:00,29133,"Nice whitie,,,,,,And herring."
536078,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-07 21:25:00,2582, The only fish I have caught to keep and then never ate. Got a few on Nip years ago fishing for walleye. Tried filleting one and found there small bones a real PITA ...and not much meat either. We gave up and threw the 2 or 3 we had in the garbage. Never had the desire to keep one since that episode.
536412,MJIG,2011-01-08 13:08:00,227," They are perhaps the easiest fish in the world to scale. You can almost do it with your own fingernails.  We occasionally got into them in deep Haliburton lakes while fishing for Lake Trout. Once we caught one accidentally, it was time to place a small pearl on an eight inch piece of line onto our spoon via snap swivel to get a meal."
535400,Headhunter,2011-01-06 15:44:00,5703,"I have been Perch fishing on Simcoe for many a year, but I have never caught a Herring until this year, where I have caught four in two trips. Actually we saw a few schools go right under our holes on my last trip out. All were released in a timely manner. Do my results mirrow yours? Do you think that maybe we'll see the moritorium on Herring lifted in the next few years? Just wondering out loud here! HH"
535408,NAW,2011-01-06 15:57:00,4022,"Caught 2 or 3 last year.  1 while perch fishing in 30' with minnows, and the others in about 100' jiggin a williams."
535413,Court R,2011-01-06 16:26:00,213,Caught one 2 weeks ago in 35' on Cook's bay.
535415,Terry,2011-01-06 16:36:00,14456,"last year I could have caught hundreds of them   the screen was black with them and I could see some down the hole, but I never brought my spoon up higher to snag them"
535417,12footspringbok,2011-01-06 16:43:00,459,"I'm no biologist but it seems the simcoe herring have come back to a healthy level. Already seen a few pulled out perching in cooks this year. Last year caught quite a few whitie and laker fishing and many times had massive schools cruse by under the ice. Seen some pretty good sized ones as well like 2lb+. You would think they will be having a limit on them soon, not that i care to target them."
535419,Terry,2011-01-06 16:47:00,14456,"I think the problem is there are only 2 different year class of herring, which is not enough to call it a successful come back a few more years of successful spawning and I think you will see it open"
535424,12footspringbok,2011-01-06 17:09:00,459,"Perhaps you're right Terry. That being said last year we had a massive school pass underneath me and a buddy. We watched down the whole for about 5 minutes as they passed and i recall seeing small like 8"" to bigger i would say 2 pound or so herring. One thing we can agree on is that its definatly a positive sign."
535454,Carp,2011-01-06 18:43:00,1488,"My dad, uncle and cousin caught and released 55 herring one day last winter. They could have caught more, but the lines were constantly up and down with perch as well."
535505,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-06 20:57:00,2582, Had 2 similiar days out of Innisfil last winter...60-65 FOW. Everybody in our area was nailing them.
535512,kickingfrog,2011-01-06 21:07:00,8333,The numbers do appear to be increasing. We may have a sustainable fishery in the future.
535526,steverowbotham,2011-01-06 21:28:00,1800,I agree with Terry.  They're definitely making a comeback but they're not at a level yet to lift the ban.  Give it a few more years and we may see a small limit on them.  The herring coming back is only aiding the laker fishery!
535535,jedimaster,2011-01-06 21:44:00,3472,Wonder if they will also help with the musky rehab?
535537,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 21:47:00,0,  There are so many Herring that come spring you cant keep the riggers set cause the dam herring are hitting to much. They could open it and there has been talk the passed couple years about doing just that. A small limit though and why bother. They're only good for Trout bait... They can be a pain to the point you have to move. Not that moving is a problem. On Simcoe it's the KEY!
535540,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 21:51:00,0,  What rehad?...  No fish this year! With the amount they introduce it would take two life times to do anything. Not to mention the harm that comes to the places they take them from. Not worth it in my opinion.
535543,jedimaster,2011-01-06 21:52:00,3472,I thought the musky in simcoe were on the incline over the past little while?
535549,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-06 22:01:00,0,"by themselves maybe   .....just like the herring,whitefish,trout,bass, perch etc. The OMNR is lacking in regards to fishing if you ask me. Funding might help some. ...I know...No one asked..."
535556,aplumma,2011-01-06 22:05:00,6896,"We have an area that has a very healthy mud shad population and it has become a food base for some of the best Bass,Striper and Blue Catfish in the nation.I hope it does the same for Simcoe.   Art"
535600,kickingfrog,2011-01-06 23:38:00,8333, Ya but what's the icefishin' like there Art?
535603,Cudz,2011-01-06 23:42:00,2652,"Oh, here is a good one.  I have fished Simcoe for quite some time.  Lets say the better part of 25 years.  I have caught a total of 1 herring. Weird."
535694,Headhunter,2011-01-07 02:09:00,5703,I've fished for Perch for quite a few years and this is the first time I have every caught one... and I've caught four and seen nine caught in two trips to Cook's Bay this year. Just sayin HH
535704,BillM,2011-01-07 02:40:00,17367,I saw some guys getting busted at the IBP boat ramp last year with a bucket full of herring..  I can't imagine the fine they got for that.
535819,oldphart,2011-01-07 14:32:00,665,"~~~Back in the 50s as a kid we phished for them off Minetes Point look down the hole and watch giant schools swimming around, and we would be using barley for bait, dropping it down the holes, and using a treble hook with a pearl attached, you could catch a bushel a day, and that why we needed to ban phishen for them, and I still believed the ban should stay in place, for a few more years, then have a set limit on them"
535823,Headhunter,2011-01-07 14:38:00,5703,"Herring is a new thing for me, so I have a question for you ""old timers"".... so to speak! How do you prepare them, assuming you were keeping them for the table? Are tehy good table fare... I sure do like pickeled Herring! Just curious... HH"
535831,Beats,2011-01-07 14:49:00,543,I've caught one herring on Simcoe while laker/whitie fishing a few years ago.  I know a guy who caught ninety-six (not kept) in an hour once back when there was no limit on simcoe.  Supposedly really dumb fish that once a large school comes they will hit anything as fast as your line can get near them.  Never eaten one but I know they are great smoked.  Easy to catch and great to eat is a bad combo for any fish.
535836,Woodsman,2011-01-07 14:52:00,1286,"A week & a half ago I caught one about 16"" long in Cooks Bay when fishing for perch in 31 fow."
