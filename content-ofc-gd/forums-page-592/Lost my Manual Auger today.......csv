It fell out of my sled and didn't realize until it was too late. It's the folding 8"" off-set style.  If you found it please email me...   [emailÂ protected]  Thanks, Colin"
537191,BillM,2011-01-09 22:52:00,17367,"Ah crap man, are you kidding?   We didn't see anything on the walk back in."
537194,ckrb2007,2011-01-09 22:56:00,449," Well I guess it's my fault for not checking as we walked out. We walked back in once we noticed but didn't find it either so we drove to my buddies place and grabbed his. There were lots of guys coming out at the same time as us so I'm crossing my fingers that someone on one of the fishing boards finds it.............by the way Bill, this is Colin...the guy who bought your suit. LOL"
537196,BillM,2011-01-09 22:57:00,17367,"I know exactly who it is by the avatar pic  :)  I hope you find it bud.   We got squat today, walked out almost all the way to Snake, lol."
537197,irishfield,2011-01-09 22:59:00,26272,Amazing how fast stuff gets scooped up out there. My auger cover disappeared in 10 minutes last year!
537199,bassman87,2011-01-09 23:00:00,586,hope you get it back
537221,ckrb2007,2011-01-09 23:45:00,449,"Yeah it is amazing that nobody yelled at me since there were lots of guys getting on the ice shortly after me....and there's only really one ""ice road"" out to the fishing grounds. I hope I get it back as well since it was a father's day gift from years gone by.  Fingers crossed."
537222,I'mHooked,2011-01-09 23:46:00,525, Roughly how far is Snake from Innisfil?
537223,misfish,2011-01-09 23:51:00,29133,Too far for walking IMO.
537231,BillM,2011-01-10 00:35:00,17367," I was just about to say this, lol!!!!  According to my GPS we did about a 7km loop today.  I also didn't turn the GPS on at the ramp, probably about half a km out."
537237,wallacio,2011-01-10 00:51:00,475, At least we got our exercise in for the day bud!   The legs are going to be burning tomorrow!
537257,BillM,2011-01-10 01:28:00,17367," Sorry, I forgot to answer your question.  A solid 4kms, most likely a little further."
