536688,spincast,2011-01-08 22:11:00,3279,"Last year, I shopped for boats. Surfed the internet, read magazines, and dreamed. Hit the Spring Fishing and boat show. Bought a boat in March and proceeded to go nuts as the first 4 weekends after I bought it and brought it home had high winds and crap weather.     Well, cant do that again (unless I get a BIGGER boat, but that's for another year), but, seeing as how this boat thing is new to me, my experience before being limited to river fishing or my 12 ft tinner, and I like to fish for something more substantial when the opportunity permits, like below caught off Port Burwell on an outing with Vinnom last year   I figure this one has lots of potential for now.  HOWEVER  that doesnt mean she's all done ... and although I dont mind getting wet, and wearing my rain gear, its always nice if you can, minimize it, I set myself this goal this winter of upgrading a few things - so first was adding a bit of water proofing to the machine this November courtesy of a local canvas shop   Next, was an investment in speedy down riggers - with a pair of Scotty pro packs, then some spygear -  Lowance Elite 5, a couple more down rigger rods, lead core set ups, a dispey rod (just got that today) and the trollers bible. Still to do is get some pictures to Buster so he can look over a set up of d-r  and rod holders. For the most part - other than the electronics - I try to buy at discounts - like the sale Fishing fanatics had for going out of business or from trolling the fishing forums.  Then, eveyonce once a while I make the occassional sacrcastic comment on this board, or hijack a thread and watch all the Monty Python guys come out. Or just enjoy reading what the guys here do - even the hard water fishers - vicarious fishing I call it.  As you can probably tell, I do not deal well with winter. 88 days Twocoda.  Oh, and I put ""fishing days"" in the bank. My wife scrap books and we have kids. In the summer, most Sundays I 'm on the water, so she's got the kids. In exchange, in the winter if my wife wants to scrap book, hit the spa or do wahtever, I say see ya. That way I have ""get out fishing cards"" for all water of the soft water season Frankie65 keeps teling me he's going to give me the hard water addiction, but so far weather hasn't been too coperative."
536696,AverageJoeFishing,2011-01-08 22:25:00,70,"Your gonna have to start ice fishing man! lol If not your gonna be watching lots of fishing shows on TV , reading lots of fishing magazines... and watching lots of hockey games lol  Dress warm and get out there... If you want fish that have lots of action during the winter months go for some pike, lake trout, whitefish,perch or some splake fishing. Splake is my favorite during the winter months because they will bite all day and are very aggressive just gotta do some research to make sure wich lakes have been stocked from year to year "

536727,irishfield,2011-01-08 23:23:00,26272,I was going on a fishing trip one time and told my wife to pack my silk boxers. When I got back I told her that she forgot to pack them and she said crap... they're in your tackle box !

536734,bigugli,2011-01-08 23:27:00,6138,"Before I took up with the ice fishing, I would sit in front of the TV, drink beer, watch too many shows put on by so-called ""fishermen"" or watch the Leafs pretend to play hockey"
536737,mercman,2011-01-08 23:29:00,7054,Hey Bernie absolutely love that ole boat.Loks like the one my dad took us out in when i was 10. belonged to my Gramps. Is it cedar strip or spruce.
536754,marth11,2011-01-08 23:45:00,60,"before I took up ice fishing I would go steelheading with little to no success got tired of not catching and gave up on that, a buddy asked me to go ice fishing with him so I went a to local tackle shop and bought my first rod which came with the epic spring bobber and a scoop of minnows, cracked open some pre drilled holes and caught this   was hooked so I went next weekend since I was in school with another friend no minnows anywhere so I used preserved minnows on a swedish pimple and caught this    and here is a vid of the fight as well    so long story short is eventually you will get the bug and get hooked on ice fishing"

536427,splashhopper,2011-01-08 14:20:00,2931,"I used to to paint on the glass with my nose too.  Then I started ice fishing! It is a LONG time until trout season opens around here and even longer for bass.   Give it a try, you might ""get hooked"" on a new OBSESSION too."

( -11c with windchill of -17c   this am going UP TO  windcill of -10c this afternoon)  But if I knew of a hut or two close to London, I would be jumping all over that to go.  We'll see though.
