536535,danbouck,2011-01-08 17:32:00,4380,"2010 was once again a very busy year. I didn't get out as much as I wanted too but still made a lot of great memories. Best part of 2010 was realizing that my kids are getting old enough to spend more time outdoors with me   . I still made time for fishing with friends but the majority of time was spent with my family fishing, camping and many other great things.  Monster Jam - I am never missing one of these shows again, just amazing!      Long Point Bay Ice Fishing - I only made it out once last year      Long Point Bay Perching - Twas a good year        I wish i had smaller hands        Carping - A new found love        Cottage Time -                Lakair - What happens at Lakair, stays at Lakair      Bassin' - Only targeted bass a few times this year          Pike - The year of the snotrocket          Restoule - A gem        Fish-A-Thon - Amazing Day        Let's see what 2011 brings!     Dan"
