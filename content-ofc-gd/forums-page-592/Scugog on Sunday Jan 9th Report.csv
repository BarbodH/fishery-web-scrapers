I booked with http://www.stilesfishhuts.com/ pretty much at the eleventh hour.  fit 7 people in a 6 man hut. ( 4 guys and 3 ladies)  fished from Viewlake from about 10:30 to 3:30.  Steve is a good guy.  Had us set up and ready to go the minute we got there.  Like all of you said he told us before hand that the bite doesn't happen till sunset or really early morning.  He offered to let us stay as long as we wanted ( nice of him to do so)  The fishing action was constant the minute the lines hit the water, if you were okay with catching little dinks ( biggest was 6"").  It was fun for the first timers that were with us so atleast we didn't get any complaining.  Over all a good day for everyone.  It beats changing diapers and I made it home to watch the packers win!!  There were photo's but I don't think a 6"" perch deserves to be displayed with all the other photo's on here.  Like putting a stick person drawing next to a Picasso.   Nick"
