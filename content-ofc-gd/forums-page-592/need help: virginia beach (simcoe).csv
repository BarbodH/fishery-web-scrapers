536388,Grimace,2011-01-08 06:59:00,2020,You have to check for your self.  It would be irresponsible for anyone to tell you if the ice is safe.  There is no such thing as safe ice.  If you would be uncomfortable checking for your self than you will have to wait until layer in the season. I am sorry to sound like s bit of a wiener but you cannot just go around talking about safe ice.  Safe ice is judged by the person on it.
536395,Terry,2011-01-08 11:11:00,14456,but there are lots of skidoos and atvs on the ice around virginia beach but again judge the ice for yourself
