Basically sign up a new account on their photocentre website HERE and you get 50 free 4x6s. Then with this code fsi50bonus you get another 50 free. Just upload pics and they are ready in an hour"

537002,Beans,2011-01-09 14:44:00,3339, Thanks for posting this Dan...  My printer (Lexmark 3470) always has a green tint to any pics I print even on Photo quality paper  I was hoping to get some decent prints to take to Jack's (Nanook) Celebration of Life Memorial at Buckhorn Community Centre next Sunday 19 Jan 2011...
537032,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-09 15:41:00,3761,"Cool stuff, my dad want's me to print off lot's of pictures of out summer trips these last 2 years while the pictures are still safe on my computer.

537051,shane,2011-01-09 16:44:00,652,You can even e-mail your pics in and then you only have to stand in line to pick up your prints. Or you can have them mailed to you and then you don't have to go there at all.
537053,Grimace,2011-01-09 17:02:00,2020,Yep pretty slick.   I can not find out where to put the bonus code in though.

537296,BillM,2011-01-10 02:47:00,17367,If you want high quality reproductions (ie you're going to frame them) don't get them at Walmart.  You get what you pay for unfortunately.
537298,Gerritt,2011-01-10 02:50:00,6129,anyone else having issue with the preview  not working?  Thanks for the heads up Dan .
537309,danc,2011-01-10 03:03:00,4677," I can't speak for myself because I print my own stuff, but in several photography forums that I frequent, Walmarts photo lab is often highly recommended by posters that live for photography."
537311,brifishrgy,2011-01-10 03:07:00,559,"  I cant upload the pics, its probably just their site having an exra bunch of activity from everyone on OFC"
