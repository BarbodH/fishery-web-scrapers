536496,Mike01,2011-01-08 16:31:00,378,"so I'm heading out on Nipissing with my four year old today.  Is he allowed to have his own line on top of my two, or is it split up between us?  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
536498,irishfield,2011-01-08 16:33:00,26272,He can have two of his own by the regs.. but can he actually tend them himself?  I know at least one here that put his new born baby in a love seat and ran two extra lines on Lake O !!
536504,Mike01,2011-01-08 16:37:00,378,"I had a quick peek through the regs but couldn't really find anything.  He's almost five so I'm hoping he can, but I guess there is only one way to find out!  My plan was to have a tip up outside and the two of us jigging in the hut"
536506,irishfield,2011-01-08 16:38:00,26272,You'd be fine doing that Mike. One rod and tip up yours and him beside you jigging his own. Even if you put the rod in a holder beside him in the hut you are legal as he's tending the line and will pick up the rod when you yell fish on... no different than us yelling at Terry !! lol
536507,splashhopper,2011-01-08 16:42:00,2931,  Geesh... what did Terry ever do to you guys ?   lol
536513,Dondorfish,2011-01-08 16:55:00,1000,[quote n no different than us yelling at Terry !! lol    Poor Terry - always gets picked on!   Tracker (Don)
536516,Muskieman,2011-01-08 16:58:00,2472,four lines between the both of you.
536548,Mike01,2011-01-08 17:49:00,378,"great thatnks guys, just heading out now.  I'll post some pics when we return."
536551,Terry,2011-01-08 17:56:00,14456, DAMN  can I say damn  damn
536552,irishfield,2011-01-08 17:59:00,26272,Good luck Mike!!  Terry...    thought you were going fishing..
