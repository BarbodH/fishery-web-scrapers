536012,GBW,2011-01-07 19:38:00,8460,"Hey all.  Well I'm in need of some new winter boots; so who's better to ask then you all?      I don't want to spend more then $100 if I don't have to.  I'm looking for something light and warm for walking to work and back to the GO station.  I have my other ice fishing boots but they are too heavy and starting to smell (I think HH likes the smell tho   ).  So, any ideas?  Thanks.  Geoff"
536016,ketchenany,2011-01-07 19:42:00,3229, CT has an assortment. Have had a pair for 3 years half leather half rubber. Warm and waterproof.
536017,muddler,2011-01-07 19:43:00,623,"Try some snowmobile type boots with a replaceable liner. All kinds of those available at marks workwear and CT, Zellers, Sears, etc. Good time to buy a pair as a lot of stores have sales on those items. Get an extra pair of liners and switch them when wet. Warm and light.  muddler"

536128,SBCregal,2011-01-07 22:22:00,688,"i bought them at sportchek, but lots of places seem to have them.  you'd probably get the best pricing online somewhere, just go to the store to size them or whatever then buy online.  that was my plan, but they were on sale when i went in to try some on.  as for considering it light... well i wear workboots all day, so these are definitelty lighter than what im used to wearing  ryan"

536413,SlowPoke,2011-01-08 13:08:00,2984,"If you can try on a pair of Red Wing's. I've bought probably 20+ pairs of boots under $100 and none of them have fit so nice out of the box. They're warm in the snow yet my feet don't get too hot while driving. They're light, dry and have as much grip as my Sorel's. When I need to replace them, Red Wing will be my first stop and I don't regret paying over $100."
