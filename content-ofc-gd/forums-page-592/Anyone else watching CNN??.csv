536915,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-09 03:57:00,4399,"  Yes but when you mix a nut with a gun you see what you get, just way too easy for the nuts to get the guns!!! Remember the Florida car dealer that was offering a AK47 with a vehicle purchase and that is just nuts as you say!!  Nice too know that perhaps a neighbor or two have a AK47 at their fingertips!!!"

536924,irishfield,2011-01-09 04:20:00,26272,Sorry guys.. but the lunatic fringe doesn't stop at the border. It's not like we haven't had our own similar nut jobs up here..
536928,Roy,2011-01-09 04:22:00,13728,Folks love this kind of stuff. I don't think we need this on our board. Good night children.
536627,Gerritt,2011-01-08 20:53:00,6129,Massive shooting in Arizona... including a Congress Women shot point blank... as well as a Judge...  Last I saw 17 shot 6 are dead...  Watching a live news conference on the CNN website...  I hope for the families of this tragedy that those wounded recover from their injuries.  G

536644,Muskieman,2011-01-08 21:11:00,2472,  I know ... it's just nuts........glad I live in a small town.. not to say that we're exempt from stuff like this but it's less likely to happen.

536695,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-08 22:24:00,4399,American`s sure love their guns! My sympathies to the victims and their families.
536699,Grimace,2011-01-08 22:28:00,2020,I hope she pulls through.   This is terribly depressing to me.  Dr Sal.   I saw that before also.  The guy she beat in the elections was making references to automatic weapons and what not as well.  They pander to the gun lobby so they use terms like that to get public approval.  I wouldn't think that anyone would take it seriously enough to kill people. If they did they are nuts anyways and you can't go around worrying about how a loony is going to take what you say.

536826,Garry2Rs,2011-01-09 01:30:00,1425,Leave the gun lobby alone. Nuts is nuts and this was done by a nut.

536853,mercman,2011-01-09 02:15:00,7054,  i second that.Nutz is as nutz does.
536856,Grimace,2011-01-09 02:19:00,2020,"I said nothing of the gun lobby except to explain why Sarah Palin has targets all over her stuff, and why the guy Gabrielle Giffords was running against said something to the effect of ""go with a full automatic"".  The second half of my post read exactly like this --  I wouldn't think that anyone would take it seriously enough to kill people. If they did they are nuts anyways and you can't go around worrying about how a loony is going to take what you say.   The guy was a nut.  Plain and simple."

I've had friends that have lost everything ex.( came home and found wife with his best friend)  Some don't care, but others see red. We just hear one side sometimes. Just saying thats all.
