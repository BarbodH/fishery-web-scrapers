536811,Twocoda,2011-01-09 01:08:00,4130,if your posting reports to be commended on your efforts....then your posting for the wrong reasons Mike...quite honestly ....bass bore me ...ive read your reports and normally always do they are very well written but i dont post a response ....i didnt even make a comment on your thread when you caught that almost 7 pounder...doesnt mean it wasnt an excellent report of a wicked fish.... just meant (to me ) oh ....nice bass!!!!...to bad its a bass..  there are several reasons i dont post fishing reports on here...a few quick ones would be  1 There are already some great reporters for the fish species im passionate about 2 My fishing location is accessible by a vehicle for anyone that can put 2+2 together (and i think photoshopping out the scenery is stoopid) 3 Im a techno peasant..heck i just learned to type while keeping my tounge in my mouth  remember Mike you dont need validation if it makes YOU feel good!

536841,Rizzo,2011-01-09 01:51:00,4754,"I love the way OFC confirms the statement ""nothing new under the sun""...in the 6 or 7(?) years I've been a member here we see the same things over and over...the giant Italian pike...the giant sturgeon...THE SIAMESE PIKE...and of course the ""nobody replies to my posts"" thread. Fortunately this one doesn't come up nearly as often as the others. Don't take any offense Mike, there's lots of reasons people might not respond, but there's all kinds of people who enjoy those well written, time consuming posts that you and many others make. Sometimes its just easier to comment on non-fishing posts because people are often looking for advice. When you read a great fishing report there often isn't much more to say than ""great report""...so what's a guy to do? You can write ""great report"" 5 times a day, or you can offer practical advice on snow tires, motors or fishing lodges. Let people respond where they want and don't sweat if a report gets only a few responses (even though it may be frustrating after the effort it took to write). Regardless of the # of responses, we all love great fish porn!"

Not replying to a thread doesn't mean WE don't like reading and getting some good info. Maybe I bore people with my threads, some reply and lots don't. Coming here is a place to laugh,learn,get info,make friends,and maybe give a little info. You could be right, maybe just reply with the Thumps up emotion. But can you see how many pages we would make on every thread. Now that you made me type for an hour. You own me a good fishing tip or story"

I guess I just didn't understand why there were lot's not writing but that's ok now because i now see lot's of people appreciate the reports that they look at on here...just never put 2 and 2 together. I'm not taking any offence so don't worry, I know I don't just fish to make them and get a bunch of ""congrads"" but when I fish I take the photo's to put them together, it's good fun for me to tell my story to tones of people when im fishing. Never had people in the family who shared the sport with me and there was a lack of friends in high school who fished, just got drove out and I did my thing....OFC is my second family  Keep em coming"

I read your post yesterday but was in 'surf' mode as opposed to 'reply' mode, it was on my to do list as i try to reply to all fishing report threads as i know how much time they take to put together...Gawd only knows how Moosebunk finds the time....lol....and i know i have not replied to some of his...SHAME ON ME.  Like Rizzo says though, this post being a case in point....if it asks for opinion or initiates debate its more likely to get a response, cuz fishing reports tend to be self explanatory."

My thing for replying depends on the time I have most times I am reading I dont have alot of time to sit and post replies I just read and go, or I dont have anything to add so I read and go.  I usually check in here and a few other places and then try and get away from the computer maybe I should be posting more kudos for the reports out there if for no other reason then to let the person know that there time was not wasted.  For me and lack of threads heck last year i only got out fishing 4 times since July 5th alot of family stuff and it kept me away from the lake all is good now but the ice is here so the boat will be away until who knows.

I don't post them up either, but if someone is asking for info on a place I know about, or have fished recently, I'm always willing to help!  S."
537020,JohnF,2011-01-09 15:23:00,3494," I know what you're saying Mike but the fact is that we're off the water right now and I think most of us aren't that interested in hearing the same old same old rehashed ad nauseum unless it's a truly incredible story.  There doesn't seem to be as much hard water talk as last year but I'm not interested in that so probably am missing the good stuff that's posted.  My take on the posts we're getting right now is that it's nice to see there are members who want to maintain a connection to the site and the other members by finding other material to discuss even if it's not fishing related. I like a lot of the people I've met here and look forward to meeting many more, and reading about our other interests etc is a great way of getting to know the rest of you.  Many similar forums (not necessarily fishing related) are exactly the same. The keeners want pure fishing, or diving, or golf (others I've been active in) but the truth is that after a few years as a serious reader/contributor to an active board you get tired of answering and/or reading the same posts from newbies and new members over and over again and though it often sounds rude to keep sending them to the search function cuz it's been done to death already it's what's gonna happen.  I say just enjoy the posting activity and if it bores you then either find some fresh fishing content to offer in hopes of stirring fun or informative responses, or just take a break till the fishing talk heats up again. There's only so much new gear stuff the guys like 2RR's can offer up and it's great when he and the others can. Newer fisherpersons like you and me don't have as much to offer in terms of experience and gear knowledge. We're still learning and not ready to teach yet although at the rate you're going you'll be on the giving end of the technical stories soon enough. I've been exactly where you are when I first got into scuba diving and was itching to learn everything I could online and hear as many great stories as i could there. But the day came when I was on the old hand side of the forum able to talk the tech talk with the best of 'em and was as guilty as anyone of wandering OT and talking other stuff out of boredom.  Hang in there. The warm water's coming, bud.  Respectfully JF"
536624,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-08 20:50:00,3761,"Hey OFC got a few concerns about this great place. First off I know it's winter and times are slow right now on the board but I keep seeing reports coming and going and we are only getting 10...15...somtimes only 3 or 4 reply's to a report. I love to share reports and put a short story together for members to see but it seems nobody is really taking the time to post and give out a ""good job"" anymore. I try my best to find reports and give a good job out whenever I see them and it's because this is the best part of OFC to me is to share my catches and view others.  From this comes another question, I know there are lot's of members here that are on the form and just don't post...for whatever reason though we are getting the most replys on pages that have nothing to do with Fishing. This is a great community and off fishing topics are great, but with a armm of fisherman that we have don't you think it's the fishing the members(you) would be paying attention to.   Happy Ice Season fokes, I encourage members to post reports and we all say this when we get new members but are we not giving the good gesters for the work(it's not much to upload and post) that we do for sharing our adventure.  First rant, well see where it goes.  Mike The Bass Fisher"

536638,aplumma,2011-01-08 21:05:00,6896,Actually it is not a rant it is the direction that the Moderators are striving for this Community to go in. It is a monumental job because the glamor of the winternet brings an atmosphere of the train wreck syndrome. (You are afraid to look because you will see the wreck...You are afraid to not look because you will miss the wreck.)While we will attempt to continue to keep the board from offending people with its content we have allowed a lot of latitude as far as content regarding sensitive subjects. If people keep the basic rules in mind as they post we should all survive to fish the soft water season.  If you have never posted a report with photos you don't know how much effort went into the process. Your average trip down memory lane takes at least 1/2 hour and a end of the year extravaganza can be hours of their time to share the memories with you. If you enjoyed the thread a short thank you is more than enough payment and who knows your next fishing buddy just might appear.   Art

536676,irishfield,2011-01-08 22:00:00,26272,Don't let it bother you Mike.. I know it's hard. I've had some threads that took me 3 hours or more to put together that got less than a dozen replies. It certainly does make you wonder why you bothered in the first place. Then some guy just finishes his drug deal I mean sandwich.. gets a gun shoved in his nose and it goes 12 pages..
536680,solopaddler,2011-01-08 22:03:00,8605,It does take a lot of work putting a decent report together. No doubt about that.  I've been slacking recently but I'll put something together soon.

536697,bigugli,2011-01-08 22:27:00,6138,"Yes, sometimes, you will put up reports and get few responses, but you will get a couple hundred views. Some people may or may not care for your reports or the style of fishing, or the target species. It comes with the territory. I share because I can. I just haven't had much worth starting a thread with lately. Other times we just aren't here to reply to a thread, haven't much to say, or someone has said it for us already. Some of us have been kinda pre-occupied with some real heavy crap lately and fishing just isn't on the mind. 11 pages of music bits was a great way to forget about some of that crap.  This is not to put you down. I'd love to think of nothing but fishing all day. Unfortunately it just ain't possible. You do put up great reports and some neat stories. Be happy that you can."
536701,fishnsled,2011-01-08 22:38:00,3520,"My 2010 year was pretty average for fishing. Nothing really worth while posting imo. Lots of numbers just not the size. How many pics of small to medium sized fish do I need to take a picture of, not many unless there was something special about the fish. I also fish with Cliff and he takes all the pictures and puts up the report.  Maybe Lincoln will put up the report from our day of bassin' but I doubt it, I just smoked him with fish after fish while he took them pics. I think he is still up set about that.  If nothing else he should post the pic of the boat with all the crap he brought that day.  I also think more people are protective of the locations they fish and will not post any pics. I don't blame them for that either. Others are just busy with life perhaps. I've also done up reports in the past and forgot to copy them before trying to preview or post them to have all the work disappear. To po'd to type it up again so no report.

Nothing personal against anyone, it's just not something that gets my attention.  As for posting fishing reports, I haven't put one up for about 3 years now mainly because I have no time for all the so called ""musky experts"" around here that like to disect everything and have far too many opinions for my liking, but that's just me.

I love your reports and think that the passion you have for fishing reflects the detail you put into them  The board has not change one bit.  It's been the same since the day I've joined back in 2008.  I've posted a lot of reports since then and some get replies and some not as much,  I'm fine with that.  The control you have when posting is when you press the submit button but the reply button  is another story, you don't.  I could name a few members that post regularly and don't get replies for it and that's fishing and non fishing reports  I understand your frustration not getting the replies to the reports you post to share but you can't expect every member browsing at the time to drop in and reply.  I for myself, this past Friday celebrated my dad's birthday without him (past away a couple of years ago) and was in no mood to chime in / in any of the threads being posted  Hope this was not to harsh on you but is what I think of this rant Keep doing what you enjoy doing, go fishing and post reports!!!

When i saw the name Ontario Fishing Community,i wasnt sure, I live in Quebec, if i was allowed to join.But i applied, and was surprised to see other quebecers in here too. When new to a forum, its hard to get accepted,and find your niche, thats why i get into everyones 'face' and jump right in with both feet.There are some 'clics' in here.members who only reply to 'friends' threads, but that happens everywhere, and is a normal.I have met some really good people on this board, not bad for a guy who joined only 7 months ago  tite lines  Paul"
536774,spincast,2011-01-09 00:22:00,3279,"If the point of posting a report is to see how many replies you get - then, IMO, you may need to consider why you post (or fish?). I post to share my enjoyment. Size of the fish doesn't really matter - its nice when you get a PB and we all want to share those. But hey - how often does that happen? Any day on the water - fish or not - and we have seen some really cool posts where the posters got skunked - is a good day . Some posts I reply to some I don't, depends on so many things we experience in life. Some days I'm just too tired to respond. But I still enjoy the read! As many have said - family, medical, personal issues are common to us all. But we do read them, and we enjoy them, even if we dont respond to them. AND somedays, with friends who share common interests, we just want to share a joke, a barb, some pain, some joy. We all come here cuase we fish, but we share far more than that everyday  Although really, why do Leafs fans still exist....... I mean if we fished a river that skunked us that often.... but I digress."
