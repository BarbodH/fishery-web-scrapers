536649,Big Cliff,2011-01-08 21:18:00,6899,"Just had a wonderful day fishing with CPH. We met up at 7:00 am and had a fantastic breakfast at the curling club in Oshawa then headed out to lake X. I had trailered my ATV as I had a new 4 man SubZero I wanted to try and walking 3/4 of a mile hauling a sled load of gear is getting a little hard for this old man. CPH thought it was kind of neat when I un hooked the trailer from my SUV and hooked it up to the ATV, we loaded all our gear and away we went (yes Beans we had helmits LOL).  We got to the secret fishing hole, drilled a couple of holes and within minutes Steve had fish on. Wee fished for a bit and while it wasn't too cold we decided to try to set up the hut. It took us about 5 minutes to figure it all out and binge hut up. Then I lit my new Bear Cat heater up. we moved our gear inside, and continued fishing. We didn't count but there was plenty of action and we managed to land about 25 nice keepers and the action was fairly steady until about noon then Steve hooked a nice size pike which gave him one heck of a good fight but got off just short of the hole. That was the end of the pirch bite. We stayed until about 1:45 and decided to head back.  I have to tell you, that SubZero was wonderful, lots of head room, plenty of space for two guys and all their gear and that little heater kept it quite comfortable. I parked the ATV on one side and the trailer on the other to anchor it to, it wasn't going to go anywhere LOL.Packing up was a breeze, I would say it took us less than 2 minutes to drop it down and pack it up. In the future I would think we could set it up easily in less than 2 minutes now that we know how it all unfolds.  Anyway a wonderful day with a great friend, some fish to boot, what more can a man ask for.  Thanks again Steve for a fantastic day!"

536656,Muskieman,2011-01-08 21:26:00,2472,great report ... but you need a camera and a photobucket
536659,irishfield,2011-01-08 21:28:00,26272,He gave his camera away... it's in the Mississauga sorting station right now...  Great to see hear you were out Cliff..
536661,Joey,2011-01-08 21:30:00,9122,Great report Cliff.  Sounds like a great day.  I'm about to meet CPH shortly  Joey
536682,bigugli,2011-01-08 22:03:00,6138,Glad to hear you fellas had a great day. We opted to stay close to home and hunt for crappie ( something to do with the son not getting home til 2 am  ) Less than stellar results. Highlight of the day was a 3lb smallie. He got off at the hole by lodging the hook in my hand.
536736,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-08 23:28:00,140,"Was going to go out today,but took one look at the snow early this morning and went back to bed,guess I am getting too old for this.Was out to that spot with Steve a few times this year and have had some awesome fishing for big perch. Cliff I will have to get Steve going on that camera thing,but I still wouldn't want his mug in the pictures LOL."
536744,fishnsled,2011-01-08 23:34:00,3520,Sounds like a great day Cliff! Thanks for posting.
536746,BUSTER,2011-01-08 23:38:00,1336,Sounds like a perfect remedy for cabin fever.   nice to get out even better when the fish bite.
536748,misfish,2011-01-08 23:39:00,29133," Dang,is he still bothering you about that? LOL  Great report Cliff.Good to hear aswell yer getting out.Those big huts are hard to pull,just ask Terry.   TFS"
536775,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-09 00:25:00,2582,"Thx for a great day Cliff.  For a walker, getting an ATV ride out AND fishing in a heated hut was like winning the lottery  As I said several times today..I was very impressed with the Sub Zero. Tons of room and very easy to set up. I love my flip style hut, but I'm thinking that the Sub Zero is the ticket when the time comes to get the Grandson out.  You know where I am when you wanna do that again.I hope Sue yourself and Andy enjoy a few good feeds of perch."
536847,Leecher,2011-01-09 02:09:00,7832,Sounds like you both had a great time Cliff Just doesn't get any better then that Leechman
536852,limeyangler,2011-01-09 02:14:00,5204,Great report Cliff. Nothing better than a day on the ice with good company and a few fish too.....what more can a guy ask for?
536870,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-09 02:41:00,2582,Sorry you never came up our way Bruce...would have been good to ice a few with you. Hope your hand is OK.  Ted you should have driven up the highway. The snow stopped south of Port Perry and everything was dry and clear the rest of the way.  Pictures are for fish porn....mug shots not required.
536906,Beans,2011-01-09 03:31:00,3339, Hey Ted...are you referring to mug shots like these???        Or ones like this with fish...???     note: multiple pictures under 250K total per post     
536921,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-09 04:15:00,140,Wrong kind of fish!
536946,Woodsman,2011-01-09 09:38:00,1286,Sounds like a good day Cliff. As for hooking up the trailer to the ATV when I go out with my buddy George (his ATV) we do it that way also. In goes our 2 flip overs & equipment and out we go.  Rick
