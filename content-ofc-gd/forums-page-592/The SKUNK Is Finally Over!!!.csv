537233,skeeter,2011-01-10 00:39:00,1907,"went out with my son on saturday morning and got home here today. stayed over night in the hut. the insulation seems to work rather well--LOL i have a brinkman 2 burner stove and 90% of the time i only had 1 burner on as low as it would go. but i did have to turn it up one notch at 4am this morning. the hut is sitting over 23' of water and the perch were hitting pretty good. we kept some and threw a whole wack of them back to live another day. i have no idea how many we caught but it was a lot. we started keeping some if'y ones, but quickly started to get a little more picky as the size was getting bigger. had to keep some of the smaller ones cause they swallowed the hook to far.      perch are considered fish so the skunk is gone!!!!!"

As there's no hut, if I can just get an hour or two out of him (without his Nintendo DS  ) I'd be pretty happy. Even with those fast & furious Perch!"
