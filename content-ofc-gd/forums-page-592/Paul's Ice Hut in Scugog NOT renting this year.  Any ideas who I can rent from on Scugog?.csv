535418,quickme,2011-01-06 16:46:00,261,"Just wanted to see if anyone has had a chance to rent from Paul's Ice Huts?  I've been given a few hours of ""free"" time from the Mrs and wanted to try my luck.  I haven't been on Hardwater for about 6 years now so I'm pretty excited to be out.  Going out with 6 other people and only planning to fish from 10 - 5.  If you know anyone else let me know.  Any feed back would be great.  Thanks!  Nick"
535499,quickme,2011-01-06 20:54:00,261,  Okay so I found out Paul is not renting this year.  He's taking some time off.  Anyone help me out with renting a hut in Scugog?
535529,Terry,2011-01-06 21:32:00,14456,love to help but I don't know of any other operators over there
535592,GBW,2011-01-06 23:16:00,8460,"there is only one other and I cannot think of it right now.  when I'm back on my home pc i will look it up, but i don't know if they are still open.  i'm sure there are a few more too but they don't advertise."
535659,sash,2011-01-07 01:17:00,26,"you can try al,(not me) he had rentals last year.  mind u if those are the times you are fishing chances for any eyes' or crappies are low.  it's a twilight bite usually ,better to be there ready when the sun hits the trees.  Contact: AL 905-986-9699 or [emailÂ protected]"
535713,Jds63,2011-01-07 03:11:00,1365,never rented from this guy but have seen the ads on Kijiji  http://www.stilesfishhuts.com/
535714,GBW,2011-01-07 03:14:00,8460,"I did years ago, nice folk.  that's who I was going to look for to tell the OP"
535715,sauce,2011-01-07 03:15:00,219,"Ya, if you plan on fishing scugog from 10 - 5 you might as well bring a deck of cards. 5am to 8am and 3pm to 8pm have been best for me."
535837,quickme,2011-01-07 14:58:00,261,"thank you everyone for your replies.  As I suspect, it probably isn't the best time to go out but the MRS is giving me some free time and I'm going to make the best of it.  A bad day on the water is better than a good day changing diapers...   .  Let me give the guys you sugguested a call and see how I do.  Hopefully there will be a report on Monday from me.  Nick"
535895,Laker272,2011-01-07 17:05:00,45,"I recommend Al as listed in one of the prior posts. Al lives on the lake, and knows it very well."
535920,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-07 17:35:00,2690," Checked that out, just for the heck of it, I love the fact that they don't charge for children under 12.  Would be nice if some of the other hut operators around the province would have that policy, although many do have children that age as 1/2 price."
535925,quickme,2011-01-07 17:45:00,261,  Called AL..  REALLY nice man!  He doesn't have any 6 man huts ( have 3 ladies that are 1st timers and can't bear to be apart from their friends and their boyfriends   ) so still searching.  If I go with just the boys I will definitely get a hut from Al.  Really reasonible prices. $30 per person is awesome.  Just went to LeBaron and got some tackle for the weekend.  CAN'T WAIT!!!  Nick
536241,David Chong,2011-01-08 00:41:00,836,"Been on Scugog with Al, really knows his stuff! Not sure who would have a 6 man hut out there! Good Luck! Dave"
536415,MJIG,2011-01-08 13:24:00,227," As others have said, the action on Scugog often just gets started at about 4:30. If you pack up to leave for 5:00 on a day that the evening bite is a go, you'll be heartbroken, especially if you sat there most of the day with little action. Try to talk your friends and the operator into staying until 6:30 or 7:00."
