Fished a lake off of Lake Ontario with my buddy GoneFishin from sun up until 4ish today. Managed one pike right off the hop then got only a few strikes but made a move to some perch water just after 11am.  Here's the Pike, a little guy but a start. This was my 3rd trip out...bout time I got something with teeth    Once we moved we fished live minnows off of bottom, pretty self explanatory. Here are my 2 biggest of the day, a both just barely under 12"" with a pinched tail once thawed out and home.    Until next weekend thanks for viewing, in total I probably managed about 8 or so perch, many in the 7-9 inch range with 1 dinker. Rick managed a half dozen perch towards the end, just didn't see the size today. Bite was tough.  Tightlines, MTBF"

536195,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-07 23:56:00,3761," Ice is 9.5"" thick at our furthest spot...I'm not a early season guy, only been out 3 times. Earliest was around the same ice thickness."

536874,limeyangler,2011-01-09 02:46:00,5204,Great report Mike!  Lol..i just finished reading you 'rant' post. I saw this post yesterday and it was on my to do list tonight to reply.  I dont think i have ever got on the ice before sun up like your pic with the Pike...good job... i always plan to but then i forget the minnows/wallet/etc....  pick up smokes from the tackle shop...get chatting...etc...etc...  You have inspired me to try and accomplish that feat this season!
