497599,sauce,2010-08-24 01:06:00,219,"So I took a look at your rig. It makes sense.  I assume that your slip knots are bobber stops. Or something along those lines.  The thing I don't like about your rig is all the extra knots. You've got a lure on a leader - 2 knots. Then a 3rd knot that attaches your weight. When you hook a fish, your leader is gonna slide down the mainline to your weight. A lot can go wrong here. Especially when dealing with fish in the 20 pound range.  Just a suggestion... google ""snap weights"" to me, this is a much easier way to get trolled lures deeper. You can make your own using snaps (try the red or orange offshore releases), split rings and bell sinkers. The only limitation is how heavy of a weight your tackle can handle."
497602,highdrifter,2010-08-24 01:16:00,2534, Dat's the one!!
497603,jayess,2010-08-24 01:17:00,187, I have to agree with this -- snap-weights are a no-nonsense method.
497612,sauce,2010-08-24 01:28:00,219,No nosense is right. Time on the water is best spent fishing. Break off? Then re rig. Snap weights get you back to fishing fast. Just tie on a new lure and clip on a weight and you're in business. I imagine retying a fancy rig in a kayak could be an awkward project.

497803,dobee,2010-08-24 15:37:00,301, oh yes it will   trolling for salmon from a kayak is very doable. it takes time to master but once you do its game over for them
497807,toca,2010-08-24 15:53:00,274,hmm i could just go and buy a pickeral rig and use that instead
498021,siwash,2010-08-24 23:20:00,683,Buy a downrigger.
498071,SlowPoke,2010-08-25 01:53:00,2984,Torpedo Diver. Problem solved.
498303,CLofchik,2010-08-25 17:13:00,854," Heh, tell that to the guys in Michigan beating stinkpots in derbies!      I've been dinging Kings out of canoes for almost 20yrs, in the new mussel cleaned water stealth is king baby (why do you think catches drop off in August nowadays?)  Paddle craft can actually have an edge trolling the skinny water for staging Kings in 40-60FOW.  If you're still around here next spring I'll take you out chasing brownies in the shallows, it's like stalking bonefish around Hamilton"

497503,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 21:22:00,0,"Trolling for trout and salmon is really popular, especially with 3 way rig. But the only problem is you can get tangled with a 3-way swivel easily, so I came up with a rig I invented over the winter.  It needs:  2 slip knots 2 stopper beads an ordinary swivel  and your sinker for the main line   Instructions:  Put a slip knot on on the line Then put a bead on the line Then put a swivel (2-way) Then put a bead again Then put a slip knot again Then put the sinker on the end of the main line  You can now tighten the slip knots wherever you like to make the distance to the sinker as long as you like, and tie your leader to the swivel and your lure on the end of the leader.  NO MORE TANGLES, I'VE TRIED IT, IT WORKS, NO WORRIES MATE"
497505,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-23 21:25:00,1107,Leadcore would be a lot easier wouldn't it ?

497522,jayess,2010-08-23 21:44:00,187,"  I am not sure how this is any better than the 3-way swivel method -- the lure can still tangle on the line going down to the way, no?"
497523,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 21:45:00,0,no
497524,CLofchik,2010-08-23 21:53:00,854,"Except when you snag up you lose the whole rig. If your rig keeps getting tangled letting it down you need to drop it slower, not just opening your bail and dropping it.  In a paddle craft it's easier to drop when your moving down wind, then start on your trolling path."
497527,solopaddler,2010-08-23 22:08:00,8605,It's actually not a bad way to rig imo.  Only exception being you're attaching the weight to end of the mainline.  In a normal 3-way or Wolf River rig the dropper with the weight is always lighter line.  That way if you get snagged you just lose the weight and not your entire rig.  As an aside I've been using 3-way rigs for a long long time and have never had a problem with tangling.
497529,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 22:09:00,0,"You can use a lindy snag free weight, I can't wait to try the rig out for trolling"
497537,MJL,2010-08-23 22:35:00,2427,"That’s very similar to the helicopter rig that surf and carp fishermen use for distance casting.  It is a low tangle rig in flight because as the lead weight travels through the air, the leader (and bait) will rotate around the mainline (I’m guessing from centripetal force).  Mind you it works a lot better if both the leader and the mainline are stiff.  I’ve personally never used it with lures (or outside of carp fishing). I’ve only used it with extremely durable baits (like cow corn and boilies for carp) as the rotational forces will cause softer baits to fly off the hook.  I normally rig up my bottom bouncing/drift rigs with split shot on a dropper line.  If you have a mainline, a swivel, and then your leader and hook, you can leave a longer tag end on the knot which joins your mainline to the swivel – Put your split shots on this tag end of line.  If your split shots snag up, one gentle pull will usually slide them off the dropper."

497547,MJL,2010-08-23 23:00:00,2427," Actually Roy, the forces involved are probably centrifugal not centripetal.  Either way, I'm pretty sure no one else has used the word centrifugal either.  High school calculus is all flooding back to me now.LOL"
497548,Pigeontroller,2010-08-23 23:00:00,2793,I think I'll stick with my Downriggers and Dipsey Divers...
497549,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 23:03:00,0,Yeah downriggers would be a better choice unless your in a kayak or can't afford the equipment...
497550,Roy,2010-08-23 23:07:00,13728," No Michael, trust me, that would be centripetal force."
497551,Pigeontroller,2010-08-23 23:08:00,2793,"I hate to break it to ya, but Salmon fishing isn't going to work out of a kayak, unless you are casting the piers, which will be soon...If you're still around here next spring I will take you out on Lake O."
497556,highdrifter,2010-08-23 23:19:00,2534,Pretty soon you'll be able to get away with long ligning..  and keep in mind that you'll be able to sneak up on em way easier with your yak!!
497561,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 23:23:00,0," Your right, I've been waiting (almost wrote mating) for the salmon to come to the piers and enter the lower sections of the rivers or for the wind to come from the north so I can go to them, but it hasn't happened in the GTA yet. Thanks for the offer, but I think I can do it in a kayak. Their so close I can feel it lol..."
497562,Guest Rapala Boy,2010-08-23 23:26:00,0, whats longlining? Is this a new trolling Method
