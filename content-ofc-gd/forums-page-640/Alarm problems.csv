498357,mistaredone,2010-08-25 19:24:00,913,When I start my motor I get a random alarm sound coming from the throtel?  It goes from a few beeps in neutral to a long beep when I excellerate. The motor seems to be running fine. Just wondering what could be the problem or is it just a loose wire?
498359,walleyemen,2010-08-25 19:28:00,316,"Could be a low oil warning alarm or overheating alarm, stuck thermostat or not enough water pressure from the pump.The pick up may have some weeeds plugged up inside of it causing poor water flow."
498361,smally21,2010-08-25 19:30:00,993,"toss us some info on the make and model.  johnson/evinrude models have a precheck that is a series of beeps and tweets.  if you ignore the precheck and just start the engine, the precheck continues with the bells/lights/whistles.  just an idea, you could be hearing this."
