497467,rover1.5dx,2010-08-23 19:54:00,23,"Just dreaming of a day when I might have the time and money for a cottage.  Wondering what the best cottage lake in either the Muskoka or Haliburton district would be?  Criteria: 1) multi-species including lake trout, brook trout, walleye, bass, muskie or pike, and an assortment of panfish (yes, I know very few lakes have a combo of cold and warm water species). 2) quieter lake 3) clean water 4) good cottage association 5) money no object 6) within 2.5 hr of GTA  Thoughts?"
497469,cram,2010-08-23 20:01:00,1733," If money is no object, try Lake Rosseau -- a truly vast fishery that sees little pressure.  Hardly a quiet lake, but its so big and complex that you can easily find quieter bays/peninsulas/etc/"

My place is halfway between hali and bancroft, on a small lake with lakers and bass. There are so many lakes within a half hour drive, I have a hard time deciding where I want to fish!! After 20 years in the area, there are still sooooooooo many lakes I want to fish!!!  S."

It was a multi species lake, bass, walleye, lakers and muskie, might fit the bill for you.  http://www.ourlakes.ca/loon%20lake%20july%2016%202010.pdf"
497521,CLofchik,2010-08-23 21:44:00,854,"The best fishing lakes in Muskoka & Haliburton don't have cottages on them.  1)  Buy canoe & camping gear (think of it as a portable cottage, every weekend on a new lake!  ) 2)  Wave at angry, frustrated, indebted, passive aggressive cottagers warning you not to fish their docks as you paddle by 3)  Spend the saved money on fast motorcycles, hookers & blow"

Have spent over 150 days in Algonquin, worked in Quetico and paddled rivers in Quebec, BC, NWT and Nunavut and caught some amazing fish (cutties, grayling, arctic char, etc)...been there and will continue to do that...  ...but my next chapter in life may entail being a little more sedate and making the mrs. happy...  Keep the suggestions coming.  Thanks! "
497583,GBW,2010-08-24 00:28:00,8460,Then ask HER where SHE is willing to drive to.  I do like the hookers and blow idea...

A dream is a good thing to have, and a lake that is good for all those species is probably that: a dream.  There was a great place for sale up here a couple of years ago: one cottage on an otherwise uninhabited lake for a cool 1.5 million....but no specks!"
