497114,streamerstripper,2010-08-22 19:10:00,28,Here we go with a question about the C - hang on tight!  I'm a little confused about access above the QEW but below Erindale - on the CRAA website it has this listed as a sanctuary but nowhere in the regs is this mentioned (that I can find).  Being new to ONT I am a little unclear on the water rights laws as well - if one could access this stretch legally and stayed 'wet boot' is it legal?  Sorry for the dumb question but some places I have lived go by the 'wet boot' policy and some do not.  Thanks - please PM if you are worried about pasting sensitive info all over the net.  
497115,chessy,2010-08-22 19:13:00,610,never fished there but never take leagle advice from anyone .. call the mnr in your area and ask for the enforcement supervisor he can explain the rule... he even overrides his co when it comes to interpretation of the fish and game laws ..

Can you let me know where (maybe we missed an update on the site), as the regs section on the clubs site states it is open...see link.  http://www.craa.on.ca/regulations.shtml  Thanks,  John"
