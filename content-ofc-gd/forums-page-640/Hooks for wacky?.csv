497590,chong,2010-08-24 00:54:00,102,I would like to know what is the best hook for fishing wacky style.Right now I'm using a worm hook. 
497593,GBW,2010-08-24 00:57:00,8460,circle works too
497601,scugpg,2010-08-24 01:15:00,1373,I've been using the Gamakatsu Finesse Wide-Gap Hook...25 pack. Aint cheap but seems to keep the fish on!
497611,chong,2010-08-24 01:28:00,102, Are theses the same hooks used  for drop-shot?
497615,scugpg,2010-08-24 01:31:00,1373, Not sure...never dropshotted lol.  http://www.outdoorproshop.com/Gamakatsu-Finesse-Wide-Gap-Hook-p/gamakatsu_finesse-wide-gap.htm
497625,uglyfish,2010-08-24 01:49:00,981,"1/0 circle hooks, or 1/0 octopus hooks. the trokar dropshot hook is a good choice."
497635,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-24 02:04:00,2050,Laser sharp makes an awesome wacky rig hook... I use it for drop shooting as well... I'll find a link when I'm on the computer rather than my phone....
497641,fishindude,2010-08-24 02:13:00,220,Mustad Demon Circle Hook in size 1 or 1/0
497664,jedimaster,2010-08-24 03:01:00,3472,"Mustad weedless widegap whacky hooks. I have used em all,from trokar, to gamagatsu to circle hooks and octopus. The mustad ones perform the best."
497667,Cudz,2010-08-24 03:11:00,2652,octopus 2/0 but no smaller than 1/0 circle 2/0
497710,singingdog,2010-08-24 10:07:00,1047,The gammie wide-gap finesse hooks are great. My other favourite is the weighted wacky hook from Northland: great for getting them a little deeper and into heavier cover.
497738,bdox,2010-08-24 12:22:00,329,"Falcon weedless weighted ""k"" hook in 3/32oz or 1/16oz"
497777,Gregoire,2010-08-24 14:46:00,1397,I was watching a bass show and they recommended an offset hook to increase hook ups. Has anyone tried this? Does it make a difference?
498017,chong,2010-08-24 23:04:00,102,Are the hooks I'm using ok or should I switch to circle hooks?  
498022,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-24 23:21:00,3761,"This summer I used a 1/0 Lazer Tro Kar drop shot/circle hook. Worked well and got the fish hooked right in the top of the mouth every time just like this average senko bass. Caught lot's on these hooks and they are still sticky sharp.  Great hooks IMO, MTBF"
