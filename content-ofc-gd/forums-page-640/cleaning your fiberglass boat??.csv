497234,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-23 02:28:00,4399,Pulled the Stratos out the other day after having it sitting in the water for a couple of months and of course the algae build up was pretty bad and very tough to get off. Just wondering what you glass boat owners use to get the hull sparkling clean.
497239,vinnimon,2010-08-23 02:37:00,2593,"I use an industrial degreaser soap,used by a few companies!diluted in warm water and then I rewax the boat!"
497243,Cast-Away,2010-08-23 02:58:00,790,Lysol toilet bowl cleaner in a bucket with an small bristle broom gives amazing results! A very light scrub and them a good rinse with the hose and the slime comes right off of the hull.

497261,lew,2010-08-23 08:47:00,12766,"I use a product called On & Off that I picked up at my boat dealer. It's specially made for cleaning glass boats and really works well. Brush it on, rinse it off and the boat is spotless.  http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=8829&familyName=On+Off+Gel+Hull+%26+Bottom+Cleaner"
497264,Jer,2010-08-23 10:20:00,1426,"Most toilet bowl cleaners will do the job, especially if they say 'Swish' on the label. Make sure you rinse well."

497499,stubbex1,2010-08-23 21:14:00,164," This hull cleaner was the answer to my fiberglass boat, nothing else worked except for it. Spray on, hose off, just make sure you do it outside as it is acid based and will get you high as a kite if inhaled. Spray nine works good for upkeep afterwards."
497506,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-23 21:26:00,4399,Thanks for the tips guys!
497577,IndySKS,2010-08-24 00:14:00,134,Once you get the grunge off and want to keep it clean and shinny try Bass Boat Saver.
497794,bigbuck,2010-08-24 15:12:00,2449,"Pretty much any of the acid based hull cleaners will do the job very nicely. My boat is a mess too and I'll be pulling it out of the water in a couple of weeks to give it a quick cleaning. I picked up a 4L jug of hull cleaner at one of the local marinas for a good  price and pour about 1L into a pail and mix another litre or so of water and then fill up a spray bottle and spray the hull down, a quick scrub with a car wash brush and hose off and she looks great."
