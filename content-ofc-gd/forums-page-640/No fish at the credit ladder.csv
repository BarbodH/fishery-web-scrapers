497898,Spiel,2010-08-24 18:31:00,9065,Sometimes the best info to post on an open forum is NONE!
497901,dobee,2010-08-24 18:34:00,301, agreed!
497938,bongo,2010-08-24 19:47:00,67,"Thanks Rapala boy, but did you not pay attention to the other posts about Salmon?? Those who know when Salmon make their early runs, don't need to know from someone else, or don't need the whole world showing up at the local river, what's the point, you would do better for yourself if you keep this information secret.  I already caught a few chrome salmon, a week and a half ago, but trust me it's better keeping quiet until late September  Thanks"

497964,bigfish1965,2010-08-24 20:42:00,3382,Meh..I don't care either way. I know where the walleye will be in a few weeks.
497971,solopaddler,2010-08-24 20:57:00,8605,What I'd like to know....is Rapalaboy really a girl? (as per his/her avatar info).  Inquiring minds want to know.      I'd be inclined to cut her some slack if she's actually Rapalagirl.  
497974,Roy,2010-08-24 21:07:00,13728," It's our fault, Mike. In the profile section, gender is multiple choice and there being 2 choices, SOME people have a 50% chance of getting it wrong."

497991,salmon,2010-08-24 21:54:00,334, I will give 5 dollars for each person who hits him with a 3/4 oz spoon when he trolling in his kayak close to the Credit rocks LOL  Some guys just do not have common sense

498023,BillM,2010-08-24 23:25:00,17367," Then use a bit of common sense next time.   Check out the number of 'views' compared to 'replies' you have, maybe that will give you a hint at just how many people LURK this forum for nothing but information."
498025,danbouck,2010-08-24 23:27:00,4380, so you are saying that you are Rapala boy or girl or whatever

498032,highdrifter,2010-08-24 23:46:00,2534,This is obviously a joke.  And a bad one at that.  I think you ought to quit while you're ahead rapalagirl.
