So I was hoping that someone here might either:  -have an empty spot in a boat and looking for someone to split gas and such and go for a days fishing (or two) -Be interested in renting a boat together and going fishing -Or maybe get a small group together and do a charter?  I am in Milton so anything within 5 hours or so is fine for me. Let me know if you are interested."
