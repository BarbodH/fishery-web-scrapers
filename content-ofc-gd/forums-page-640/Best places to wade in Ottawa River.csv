498118,Parisite,2010-08-25 04:01:00,66,I'm working in Ottawa for a couple of days and I've heard the Smallie fishing is pretty good in the Ottawa River.  Driving along some areas near the river it looks like boating is the best way to fish.  I packed my waders and was hoping to wade for a couple of hours.  Does anyone know of any access points to walk in?  Thanks.
