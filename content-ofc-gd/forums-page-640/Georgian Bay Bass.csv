497448,eyefish,2010-08-23 19:18:00,135,going up to penetangushine bay this weekend and good largie spots close by?
497480,Cudz,2010-08-23 20:22:00,2652,"yes.  Go out of the penetang harbour and find some smaller bays.  find pads at the bottom of most bays.  Throw senkos or frogs over pads and hold on.  Smallies are more abundant and bigger.  Find some boulders or fish off points with tubes, slammers and senkos and you will do well. Penetang bay itself holds lots of fish too.  I actually8 caught a nice largie right beside boat launch.  There is a weedbed there and I caught it on a spinnerbait"
