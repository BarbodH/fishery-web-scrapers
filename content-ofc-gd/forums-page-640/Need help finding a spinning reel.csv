I was wondering if anyone here knows a large-sized SPINNING reel (sorry, I can't use baitcasters or standard trollers) that has a large reel foot that can fit a 8-10 foot trolling rod. Preferably Shimano or Daiwa reels. Thanks."
498148,Duckie,2010-08-25 11:13:00,305,I have a Daiww Tierra 3500 sized reel that has a pretty large reel foot. it holds 210y of 12 pound test mono so it is pretty large.  I think they go for around 120 bucks.
