498171,Dave Bailey,2010-08-25 12:41:00,1641,"  Nope, almost fell off my chair when I saw that!"
497711,Billy Bob,2010-08-24 10:07:00,5865,Not much more to say than watch this.........  
497716,danbouck,2010-08-24 11:15:00,4380,"That's about the same as 4 hours on Erie, still plenty of fish"
497717,ontariofisherman,2010-08-24 11:18:00,52,thats over a year old
497718,Roy,2010-08-24 11:20:00,13728,"Watch it carefully, there's got to be a small walleye in there somewhere."
497720,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-24 11:38:00,0,Why cant they make smaller meshes so they can catch tons of gobies!
497852,Billy Bob,2010-08-24 17:08:00,5865,I'm quite sure if they had a market for gobies they would target them but at the present time I don't know one person eating them.
497855,cwpowell,2010-08-24 17:15:00,265,How do the fish get latched on to the net?
497861,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-24 17:22:00,2582,"  That made me chuckle  ...and watch the video again. Never saw an ""EYE"" though"
497920,Billy Bob,2010-08-24 19:03:00,5865, They are GILL NETS.....the fish don't see them and swim into them head first and can't back out because their gills flare open and the netting gets behind the gill plates. Anything usually caught in gill nets are as good as dead.  And yes I thought I seen one small walleye plus one white perch in that catch.  Bob
497927,misfish,2010-08-24 19:27:00,29133,Sure is alot of comments about this.My ears were burning with all the profanity. LOL  touchy touchy subject
497929,splashhopper,2010-08-24 19:30:00,2931,I don't know about that video.... but perchin was AWESOME for Dutchy and I a few weeks ago       Average size was amazing too  
497978,misfish,2010-08-24 21:26:00,29133,"Huge perch SH. Nice haul. LOL at the cig pack,as ref to size."
497980,Terry,2010-08-24 21:29:00,14456, ok..I have to use thin line and fluorocarbon line so fish will not be spooked but fish don't see the net..how the heck does that happen...LOL
497992,dave524,2010-08-24 21:56:00,4508,"Believe this was posted here before, lots of eyes here. Can't hardly believe they can fish with a gill net and be so selective. We get lots of sheephead when angling Think there's a lot more to professional commercial fishing than the average angler thinks. I've fished Erie now for over 50 years, its as good or better than it's ever been, 70's were really a bust, lot of people thought it would never recover.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG3mTKSiyx0&feature=related"
497998,danbouck,2010-08-24 22:06:00,4380, I see SRT has seen it lol
498014,aplumma,2010-08-24 22:48:00,6896,  Am I the only one who finds this full of irony and funny on so many levels?   Art
498028,Billy Bob,2010-08-24 23:36:00,5865,Many of those who smoke are afraid to eat salmon from Lake Ontario..
498052,splashhopper,2010-08-25 00:37:00,2931,Dutchy is the smoker.. and he outfished me 3-1 that day.
498059,GBW,2010-08-25 01:10:00,8460,"No Art, the fact that ""smoking kill's"" is layed out beside the dead catch of the day is good.  Yes I had to spell it out for some that just didn't get your post...  either way, nice haul!"
498063,splashhopper,2010-08-25 01:19:00,2931, Dang... i didn't even notice that... I wonder if Dutchy saw the warning label
498066,GBW,2010-08-25 01:25:00,8460,"I think he did splashhopper and that's why he went 3 to your 1... PS, I see a dreaded white bucket of death in these pic's too...  oh the horror..."
498067,GBW,2010-08-25 01:30:00,8460,Um Billy Bob.  I smoke and if you ever catch a lake O salmon and do not plan on eating it msg me.  it can go right in to my meat smoker...
498126,shimano25,2010-08-25 05:08:00,31,"I know how marketable perch is and how great it taste, but that video just made me a tad upset."
498135,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-25 08:45:00,1107, Ya gotta love youtube hero's dude calmed down and seemed like a decent guy we talked for a bit off the comment page I think he took my first comment the wrong way LOL
498143,Billy Bob,2010-08-25 10:25:00,5865," Misunderstanding here I believe. I meant cigs not smoked fish. And I don't hesitate to eat fish from Lake Ontario, smoked or otherwise. As far as cigs, I pray for those who have trouble stopping and for those who that just started."
