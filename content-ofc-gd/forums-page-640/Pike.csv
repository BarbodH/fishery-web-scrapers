497849,diggyj,2010-08-24 17:02:00,548,Nice looking gator!  Dirk
497853,Guest natron,2010-08-24 17:08:00,0," Thanks!  He just about broke my rod, hahaa. I really thought I was snagged on either a log or stick, as I could feel it float somewhat as I pulled back. That continued for about 5 minutes, then it started running and surprised me, it went under the boat and I had to jump over to the other side of the boat, and I barely got it in time. After that, I had to baby it because I was only using 4lb mono at the time.  I wanted to get a few more pics, but it flopped and I lost my grip, then flopped again right out of the boat."
497859,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-24 17:18:00,932,That's a fat monster pike - awesome fish.  Sure beats the way those little walters scrap.

497871,mercman,2010-08-24 17:47:00,7054,What a gator !!! how do you handle a fish that size if your gonna put her back? Always afraid to hurt it.
497873,Guest natron,2010-08-24 17:50:00,0," very carefully, lol. I almost thought we would have to keep it, took about 3 minutes to get oxygen flowing and swim off, scared me as well. Didnt help how it flopped outta the boat either"
497874,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-24 17:56:00,932, Keeping a fish of that size horizontal is a must as well.
497882,Guest natron,2010-08-24 18:06:00,0," Good point!  I should also mention my pics never turned out, so this pic is of a good friend I fish with on occasion"
497967,Guest natron,2010-08-24 20:45:00,0,"Here is the orange jig I caught it on.  It's rusty now from sitting in my tackle box but that fish destroyed this jig, as you can see. lol "
