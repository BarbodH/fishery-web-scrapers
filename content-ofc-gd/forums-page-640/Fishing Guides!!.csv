So i was wondering if there are any guides on here that have an availabilty this week. i realize its really short notice but i figured it was worth a shot. It is me and a friend and we are willing to drive up to 3 hours from the burlington area. We are looking to hook into some bass pike and pickeral. So if anyone knows of anyone or anyone on here reads this and thinks they could help us out let me know! shoot me a message and we can go from there. Prices would be helpful too haha.. Anyways thanks to anyone who reads this!"

498228,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 15:23:00,932,Why not stay close to home (internet-speaking) and send a message to some of guys who contribute to this forum?  Send Garry2R's a message and send SteveRowbotham a message too.  They're both kind of in your neck of the woods.  Post a sweet report after the trip!  Good Luck.

Pauls sight fishing skills on Erie were incredible, and I couldn't believe how well he had the Lower River figured out.  A stellar angler that truly lives to fish.  A big recommend for Paul Castelano from this guy. Darcy"
