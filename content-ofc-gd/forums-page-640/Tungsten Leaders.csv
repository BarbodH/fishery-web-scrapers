It shows a pic of a pike on the package but I don't know.  These things are pretty thin.  Can they withstand a pike bite?  They are 13.8"" long.  The reason I want something thin is that I go to this lake that has nice smallies but mixed in with them are some decent pike. I am tired of setting hook and having nothing left on the other end.  I have afew fluoro leaders but the snaps on them are too big a tube.  The snaps on the tungsten leaders are really small and of good quality."

A polish fellow that fished the same area swore by them and gave me an old one he had bought from back home. It worked great since the minnow could still swim pretty freely and we never had any bite offs. The line was so thin that you could tie a knot in it and barely be able to get it out. I'm still a big fan of floro even for pike, but if you worried about bite offs, this stuff should work great."
