Alof of good suggestions and i recently tried a few on the water. I had 1 break at the knot (likely my tying skills - or lack therof), but they all seemed to work once i felt comfortable tying them.  My question this time is how beneficial is it to use some sort of glue to ensure the knot is very secure? does anyone do this with like an epoxy or something? If so, what brand/type do you recommend to put on the knot so I have real piece of mind that the bond is strong and won't break.  Thanks again everyone."
498343,ld17,2010-08-25 18:58:00,319,I've used the surgeons knot and uni to uni and have never had it slip or break.  But I can't see any harm in using a super glue on the knot.  Test it out and let us know.

498348,MJL,2010-08-25 19:09:00,2427,Loon makes something called UV Knot Strength…I’ve never used it but I used their UV wader repair stuff to make a loop in my fly line (beyond repairing my waders with)...Seemed to work pretty well and was strong.  Other products you can take a look at commonly used by fly anglers are zap-a-gap and Pliobond.  I think both are waterproof/water resistant.  I've never tried super glue or crazy glue...If you have some around the house it might be worth a try experimenting with it at home before you hit the water.

498372,bassjnkie,2010-08-25 19:42:00,1101,"I use the triple surgeon or uni to uni and never had to use glue. There is stuff called Gorilla glue, but as said above perfect the knot first, glue won't hold bad knots."
498401,BucktownAngler,2010-08-25 20:56:00,582,"no glue needed, just a well tied knot.  i've never had my knots break on me...the fluoro will snap before the knot breaks"
498425,Bernie66,2010-08-25 22:20:00,123,"I use the albright. Its a very strong and compact knot.  The tag ends comes out parallel to the lines. As for the glue, any dollar store superglue will do.  You only need a dab. I use it as a confidence thing so I know there is absolutely zero slippage in the knot.  This hasn't failed me yet."
