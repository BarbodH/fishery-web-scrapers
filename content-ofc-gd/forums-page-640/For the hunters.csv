498125,oxcowboy,2010-08-25 05:05:00,544,just wondering if you guys would harvest this young guy? Im kind of tempted just for the unique antlers.    This is also another buck that i would love to take.    jason
498130,Sinker,2010-08-25 06:05:00,8692,"Yup, I'd whack him!! I wouldn't even think twice about it!! I like those unique ones!!  S."
498132,Stern Rules,2010-08-25 07:11:00,342,Any deer's a good deer. It's not about the horns although a nice full rack would be nice
498151,BITEME,2010-08-25 11:27:00,1968,"Well not gonna lie when it comes down to deer im soley a meat hunter and that means I shoot the first deer that walks out of the bush. Male, female, one horn I really dont care and has been the case in the area I hunt its usually multiple tags. Im not big on shooting the biggest baddest buck I can find Ive let them walk by they are the breeding stock. Mind you there is a big buck in one of our spots we call him the refrigerator been seeing him on and off for about 6 years now ""his day is coming"" he is very wyly. anyway for me its just about the meat.  my 2 cents Peter"
498179,NAW,2010-08-25 13:04:00,4022,"I'm in the same boat as the guys above.  When I see a deer, I'm thinkin about venison chille, not the rack.  That's one squrrely rack though!  Is anyone else going out of their mind thinking about the upcoming season.    I have no skin left on my fingers from shooting my recurve in practice.."
498180,Steel28,2010-08-25 13:05:00,160,"as other said, I'd wack him as well"
498190,chessy,2010-08-25 13:34:00,610,never been able to eat a rack yet
498192,Harrison,2010-08-25 13:41:00,2202,"More of a meat guy now, I've got my bucks in the past.  Usually take a smallish deer early for selfish BBQ reasons and trophy buck hunt the rest of the season.  More of a typical fan, but come new years eve day, I'd take that buck.  Now the 2nd buck is a trophy animal where I hunt in southern Ont, and looks lean, I wouldn't pass on him."
498225,LucG,2010-08-25 15:19:00,779,"Drop him dead, put the antlers beside your 5lb bass, and the back straps in the freezer"
498245,smally21,2010-08-25 15:59:00,993,you guys can shoot 'em all. just making the back roads safer for the rest of us. im not against some nice fresh venison either!
498253,Jay T,2010-08-25 16:10:00,282,"I would have no problem putting an arrow through him, but this year I will be shooting a doe. First I must get a bear, only three weeks until I go"
498296,lew,2010-08-25 17:07:00,12766,The only deer shooting I ever do is with my camera in my own backyard      
498341,anders,2010-08-25 18:57:00,1168,with out a doubt!
498345,misfish,2010-08-25 19:04:00,29133,"I passed up a button buck on the opener last year,as I thought, the season just started and I,ll get another chance.NEVR HAPPENED.Now it,s,first come,first served.Meat is meat."
498371,jedimaster,2010-08-25 19:41:00,3472,"""If its brown is goin down"" is the motto at our camp. The only rule we have is that we let Doe's walk til the friday."
498505,Leecher,2010-08-26 01:37:00,7832,Like the majority..... definitely put it out of it's misery
