I was wondering what any other board members think about it, I kind of find it interesting.  I believe this is true, because it makes sense, the waves are coming from the direction of the wind, and the fish are facing into the waves. Anything in the water is being slowly pushed to the windward side of the lake, and so the fish in the lake are fighting against the current produced by the wind. The wind/wave action often pushes the weeds in the direction of the wind, so to swim through the weeds is easier if they are going upwind.  Having said all of this, I doubt that the wind matters quite so much if you are fishing very deep water, but I dont know.  Also, I dont really know which direction is best to present to a fish, if you come up from behind them with will they spook? or if you pull a lure straight at them will they spook? is it better to pull a lure sideways across a fishes field of vision?"

Fish have a wide field of vision and their natural food approaches them from all directions so i don't think direction matters too much. Having said that, it's easier for them to move forward to take a bait than circle round for it."
