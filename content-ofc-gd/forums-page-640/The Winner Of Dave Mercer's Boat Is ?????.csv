496783,ontariofisherman,2010-08-21 17:37:00,52,this sucks cause i never knew this contest was going on.
496788,glen,2010-08-21 17:59:00,2641,I didnt enter because i already have a boat but i hope an OFNer wins it.
496791,ColdH20guy,2010-08-21 18:12:00,312, what?!  have you been hibernating for months? how could you have missed it? lol
496842,Teressa,2010-08-21 21:51:00,55," dont feel bad, cuz I didnt either...we've gone to subway a few times this summer and didn't see signs or anything"
496851,lllmojo,2010-08-21 22:12:00,13,no result??
496889,danbouck,2010-08-22 00:22:00,4380, Read above!   I can see a server overload happening
496894,ontariofisherman,2010-08-22 00:42:00,52,"I don't like subway, quiznos is much better. If i had know i would have gone"
496897,Dave Mercer,2010-08-22 00:45:00,148,"Lets hope it does not overload lol! But hey this is once again our chance to show the world how strong the fishing world is. Lets get as many people as we can to log into the video that day. Ohhh yes that is a challenge if your wondering. Tell all your friends and family about it. Heck post it on Facebook, Twitter or your local bathroom wall. Where ever you can get the word out would be awesome. Thank you ALL for your support as always!!! Good Luck to everyone that entered!"
496900,Spiel,2010-08-22 00:51:00,9065,"It's okay Dave I'm sitting down, go ahead and tell me I won."
496911,Cudz,2010-08-22 01:21:00,2652,I hope I don't win that boat.  If I did my wife would make me get rid of it.  She is good like that.  I do however hope an ofner wins it.  That would be sweet.  Great prize by the way.  When I first heard about the contest I thought you would be giving away a little g3 tinner or something like that.  Cool bananas.
496933,mikemcmillan,2010-08-22 03:05:00,50,"Saw this ship on Lake Cecebe a couple of weeks ago, very nice, would look good sitting at my dock."
496996,Dave Mercer,2010-08-22 13:07:00,148,Yep I was up on Cecebe with my family for vacation the kids rocked the bobber's big time. It was awesome!
497002,Nipfisher,2010-08-22 13:24:00,2449, Dave did you fish at all? Or is it a vacation from the greulling job  I have seen some big walleye come out of Cecebe.
497007,Handlebarz,2010-08-22 13:32:00,3790,I saw it out of the water at US customs well duty free so I ambushed Dave heck the poor guy cant even stop off in a international safe zone with out a fan being there.  I entered but not near as many times as I should have as the stores here in the Chatham area did not get the stuff in they new nothing about it good thing for Tottenham store.  Good luck to everyone like many others I hope a OFC'er gets it I would love to get it just to put some down east rod holders on it and slime that thing up good.
497040,Dave Mercer,2010-08-22 14:56:00,148,"I fished everyday but it was all bobber fishing with my kids. I was in charge of rigging worms for them and unhooking fish lol. If you guys are looking for a great little lake to bobber fish with your kids Cecebe is a good one. You can pull up to almost any pad bed and catch bluegill, perch, rockbass and small Large Mouth until your arms are sore.  One night I did get to throw a spinnerbait around for a bit and caught a few Pike with one being a big one around 40inches. All in all it was a great family trip now back to the adult fishing before the winner of my boat take's it away from me.  Good luck to you all!"
497047,BUSTER,2010-08-22 15:04:00,1336," I entered soo many times,In every city I've visited since this started, I used my Mercer signed sub way card for good luck  I still have extra ballots in the Van pre filled out!! Cant say I didnt try..."
497050,BUSTER,2010-08-22 15:06:00,1336,"Come to think of it I wrote ""BUSTER was here"" on most of the cardboard cut out's too"
497088,johnnyb,2010-08-22 17:51:00,3413,"Sigh...I went in to a Subway once....they still had the cutout on display, but the contest was over.  I am so ashamed"
497097,GBW,2010-08-22 18:17:00,8460,"even if I don't win the boat, when do we hear about the other prizes?"
497299,Dave Mercer,2010-08-23 13:10:00,148,Yes we will be announcing the remaining smaller prizes on www.factsoffishing.com this Friday at 1pm as well. So GOOD LUCK to you all!
497325,Sherriff,2010-08-23 14:10:00,252,I would be happy with any prize but the boat would be truly sweet!!!  Sherriff
