497528,cstrapp,2010-08-23 22:08:00,3,"hey guys, new to the website but have been comming here for some good fishing info for quite some time now. I have a friend down from Australia and he wants to see what Canadian fishing is all about. I brag and brag about the fishing here but i have not been able to hook him in to some good fish. He is looking to get into some pike and pickeral, but i mean even some good action bass would be awesome. So this week we are planning on going somewhere for two days one night to get some good fishing in. Which is where i need some help. We dont really wanna travel more than 3 hours, and we have a small motorized aluminum boat so we can get to the good spots. So i know no one likes giving up the good fishing spots, but does anyone know of any good lakes within 3 hours driving distance of Burlington Ontario that we can get some good fishing in? bass pike or pickeral? we were thinking about doing a campsite or something for the night but if anyone knows of a cheap fishing cabin we can rent for the night and can help us out there please let me know! i hope someone can help us out here!  Cheers, Chad"
