497912,diggyj,2010-08-24 18:48:00,548,Am looking for a handheld GPS and was at CT during my lunch break and noticed they had an instore special/managers special on the Garmin E Trex SUMMIT.  All I really want it for is to put in some GPS coordinates/way points so I can get to the same spot in the future. Will this unit do the trick? On sale for $59.98  Thanks.  Dirk

I just got the GPSmap 60 Cx and I love it. It cost me $250, but worth every penny. As long as you don't expect a lot of advanced features from it, the eTREX is a great deal at that price."
