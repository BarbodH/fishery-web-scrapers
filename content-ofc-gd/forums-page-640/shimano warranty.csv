497653,mmhmmh,2010-08-24 02:45:00,3,Earlier today while smallie fishing my compre broke while fighting a fish i got it a bass pro last dec. I am going up north next week and dont want to buy a new rod and the warranty through shimano wont have a replacement by the time i leave. I was wondering if anyone knew if bass pro will do the over the counter warranty like they do in the states. Thanks for any help.

497663,mmhmmh,2010-08-24 02:58:00,3,Alright thank you very much
497913,mmhmmh,2010-08-24 18:48:00,3,Ok i talked to bass pro and the manager said they won't do it. I can't drive to Peterborough as i live in Dunnville so its a long way. Does anyone know the phone number for Shimano Canada all i can find on there website is a phone number that's in California. And what is aikmans?
