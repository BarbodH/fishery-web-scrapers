I cannot see why Mike Hart would cheat for a top prize of only $40,000.00, I do not know. Forty thousand dollars would not change my life.  Perhaps the reason is greed. Such people do not deserve a 2nd chance as shown by the Bass organization.  This is the kind of stuff that gives fishers like us a bad name.  Any opinions from you guys?  carp-starter  http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/blog/19468/cheating+scandal+at+us+open+rocks+bass-fishing+community/  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?id=2870012  http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/aug/23/cheating-mike-hart-acted-alone-rigging-bass-tourna/"

498064,Dave Bailey,2010-08-25 01:21:00,1641,What I find equally disturbing is the apparently increasing use by tournament organizers of those pseudoscientific pieces of garbage known as polygraphs. It shows a complete lack of scientific understanding and will lead to lawsuits when the inevitable happens and an innocent person is publicly pilloried for no reason.
