497444,misfish,2010-08-23 19:09:00,29133,    Sure is a blast.I got to live mine aswell.  Great report. TFS
497446,Duckie,2010-08-23 19:15:00,305,"the first and only time I have been on a bass boat was on Lake Tarpon near Tampa Florida.  with a 150 HP motor on the back the guide accelerated up to 60 mph. it was insane.  a memory. peels your eyelids back going that fast.  and now, they are putting 200's and 250's on the back of the same size boats. this was back in the early 90's when few had bigger than 150 HP motors on them.."
497457,mercman,2010-08-23 19:34:00,7054,"  i hear ya. he has a 175 2 stroke, but i've seen them with 250 and up. Impressive as heck, but imho, its the old 'my dingy is bigger than your dingy like he said, he's never caught a fish at 60 mph."
497460,charlesn,2010-08-23 19:42:00,551, And let's hope none of us ever do as an asian carp at 60 mph is gonna leave a mark!
497466,Terry,2010-08-23 19:52:00,14456,damn I miss my nitro and 60mph rides across lake simcoe   but the 60 bucks plus every time I started it up...I don't miss
497473,aplumma,2010-08-23 20:15:00,6896, Now what would make you make such an assinin statement as this? A boat as well as a motorcycle all have different characteristics and you drive/use the correct tool for the job. My bass boat will not go in the same water that my Jetdrive outboard does. My bass boat will not weather 3 and 4 ft seas like my Marinette will. I have 3 different boats for 3 types of boating/fishing that I do. Why does this make me an  elitist/ someone who looks down on other? Same with the Motorcycles I have 3 also one for speed one for looks and one for cruising and yes one is a Harley and the others are Yamahas. You have managed to offend with your stereotyping not only bass boat owner but Harley owners all in one short statement. Hopefully in the future you will chose not to make broad sweeps with the stereotyping brush it makes you seem other than what I know you are (a good person).   Art
497477,Cudz,2010-08-23 20:20:00,2652,Well i can afford neither but would have either or both.
497486,wormdunker,2010-08-23 20:35:00,1711,Sounds pretty wild to me !!  I'm getting too old for that speed!  A friend took me for a ride on Lake Erie at 50MPH -it was scary!!  But when we fished we caught nice jumbo perch.  Good luck fishing
497492,dave524,2010-08-23 20:49:00,4508," Back then the rules stated a max of 150HP. for the pro bass tournies. There were quite a few motors made that had 150 decals on them but were conservatively rated. It seemed that some prescribed to the NASCAR motto "" if your not cheatin' you ain't tryin'"" Guess rather than deal with the infractions they just eliminated the restriction."
497722,fish_fishburn,2010-08-24 11:44:00,1311,"I've had a bassboat since 1995. Thats when I sold my 17 foot Princecraft and bought my first bassboat. As far as I'm concerned there is no better platform to fish off of then a bassboat. Lots of storage and rod lockers. In the wind they are way better than any aluminum because of the lower profile while sitting on the water. They can float in really skinny water, and you can go like snot when you feel like it. Did I mention I also like performance and speed. We tend to get a bad rap as bassboat owners because of a few yahoos, but there few and far between."
497760,mercman,2010-08-24 13:29:00,7054," it all comes down to being responsible and using common sense.99% of all the fishers in bass boats i've come accross are modest, highly responsible people who appreciate thier rides and avoid people like me in smaller boats. However, the 1% who pass you in warp drive, 50 feet away, should be forced to fish in a paddle boat for a year"
498053,Pigeontroller,2010-08-25 00:43:00,2793,"Alright, let me justify my comments. Not all Bass boat owners are bad people. BUT, if I had a nickel for ever time some bass boat driving passed me within 200 feet at 50-65 mph while I was fishing in my boat I'd have about $4.75  I like all mororcycles. I believe many Harley riders have one purely for the fashion statement. I recently worked with one who seemed to think everyone held him in high regard and were envious because we ALL wanted a HD too!  Art. Are we ok?"
498072,fishboy,2010-08-25 01:55:00,550,Speed on the water is a blast.  A few years back my cousin had access to a boat they used in shows (some tricked out 2.5L Merc on a Checkmate) that got us up to a ridiculous 87 mph.  He got the thing over 90 on a flat day...
498119,Guest natron,2010-08-25 04:03:00,0," haha, sounds like my rig"
498342,aplumma,2010-08-25 18:57:00,6896, We were never not O.K. bud it will take more than that to chase me away. I did understand where you were coming from I just hate the word ALL it is so inclusive.   Art
497237,mercman,2010-08-23 02:36:00,7054,"My brother invited me to go fishing this weekend in his new Ranger bass boat. I jumped at the chance cause i love bass fishing. Up till now, ive never gone more than maybe 15 or 20 mph in different fishing boats, mine only has an 8hp on it, and thats always been good enough for my needs. 5 am, its a cool 10 degrees, we get to this lake just west of Ottawa, put our gear in the boat and he tells me the rules. ""if it doesnt have carpet, dont step on it, keep rods and lures off the gelcoat, and have fun."" We backed away from the dock, and he hands me some ear protection. ""whats that for"" i said "" to keep you from going deaf"" he said. Now my heart starts to race, am i going to make it  He points out the ""holy crap handles"" and slams his foot to the floor. i almost fainted. The boat went into a 45 degree stand, and as the bow began to fall, the wind began to howl, and the pressure difference between my protected ears and the outside air rushing over my face made my ears pop ! now i mentioned it was 10degrees. With a 65 mile an hour wind, whats the windchill factor,-40 i think 65 mph on water is a sureal exoerience. if i looked forward it was a blur, but when i looked to the side towards shore, we hardly seemed to be going that fast. He pointed to his GPS 65.8 mph, yup, thats what i thought i looked over to see my dear bro laffing his butt cheeks off. i looked down and saw that the wind had lifted up my sweater and shirt, and my big bare belly was taking the full -40 wind uncovered. i tried to pull the shirt back down, but it was twised behind me in an improved cinch knot that wasnt coming undone. In just under 9 minutes, we were in his sweet spot, 10 miles up the lake. My hands were so cold and shakey, i couldnt tie the hook onto my line. I had taken my hat off, and sat on it, but i think the wind lifted me a few times, cause it was no where to be found. my brother said something about where he thought it may be, and  we laffed like idiots. Make a long story short, we caught our quota of nice LMB before noon, and had a great time. His boat drives like a cadilac, minus the shock absorbers, and is the most comfortable fishing platform i have ever been on. i'll post some pics if i can figure out how. It says that they are too big to upload. Going again is September, cant wait.  "
497245,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-23 03:05:00,10439,If you thought that was wild. Ask him to take you out when there's a nice 3 foot chop and hammer down.
497246,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-23 03:06:00,1107,It sure is a lot of fun the first time I can't wait to get my own.
497250,danc,2010-08-23 03:21:00,4677,But does it catch fish??
497256,OhioFisherman,2010-08-23 03:52:00,6623,"you haven`t lived yet, get a day with a nice steady rain at blast off time, then you will understand the need for a motorcycle helmet. Rain in the car behind the windshield is a lot more comfortable than at 60-70 mph on the water."
497271,mercman,2010-08-23 11:12:00,7054," like my brother said, there are faster boats out there, but he never caught fish at 60 mph. Other than a comfortable fishing platform, you're no better off than any other boat. you maybe able to fish more spots in a given time frame, but a smaller slower boat has its advantages too."
497272,Roy,2010-08-23 11:26:00,13728,"Sounds like a good time, Paul."
497275,Rizzo,2010-08-23 11:34:00,4754,haha great story. I've only been in a boat like that once before and it is quite an experience
497297,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-23 13:07:00,0,"Sounds like a blast. I had the opportunity about 10 or so years ago to go on a 200 + H.P bass boat but turned it down. He said I would only have to pay for the gas and that it guzzles alot of gas. He wanted $80 for the day. Remember, this was well over 10 years ago."
497300,craigdritchie,2010-08-23 13:18:00,1586,The real fun is when there are a lot of bugs out. That's when you wear a motorcycle helmet with full visor. Taking a horsefly in the forehead at 70 mph is not as much fun as it sounds.
497307,OhioFisherman,2010-08-23 13:29:00,6623,"LOL Johnny, ya gas can be an issue. My SeaRay had a 75 gallon tank, docked at a marina and the fuel prices for on the water fill ups average a bit higher. It wasn`t too hard to push the limits of the fuel tank in a busy weekend, of fishing or just cruising around.  If I used a 6 gallon tank of gas on my 35hp and smaller boat I considered it a run and gun day on smaller inland lakes. A lot of the lakes and rivers here have expansive no wake zones, one river we fished often is 6mph until you get out into Lake Erie, and you could catch good fish in the river. So on rough lake days or after work open tournaments it was a favorite. You could weigh in 10-15 pounds of bass and never put the gas motor down.  It is nice to have the speed, you don`t always have to use it? Bass boats just make a nice stable fishing platform under most condition."
497342,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-23 14:57:00,947,Haha i remember my first Bass boat experience.  It was about 8 years ago.  I was fishing my first club tournament we launch my heart was racing for blast off.  not paying attention to the boater and looking at every other boat lining up for blast off.  i turn back to mention that this is my first real bass boat experience only to see him putting on a helmet.  all i thought was FML
497343,Joey,2010-08-23 15:01:00,9122,"Hahahaha,great story, reminds me of when Paul had his performance boat - what a blast!!!  Sounds like you had a good time and caught fish, perfect!!  Joey"
497383,Pigeontroller,2010-08-23 16:14:00,2793,"It seems that owning a 65mph+ Bass boat is more about going fast than actually enjoying what fishing is about...Relaxing,enjoying the peace and quiet..."
497385,ecmilley,2010-08-23 16:22:00,2163,"most people think that till they own one, I relax more, fish more am more comfortable and when i am done fishing i can cruise the lake checking out all the girls"
497392,mercman,2010-08-23 16:46:00,7054," all i could think of was Will Smith in Independance day when he got to fly the saucer.  I got to get me one of these !!!  had a blast, but i'd be happy with a princecraft pro series and a 70hp...maybe next year"
497400,fishnsled,2010-08-23 17:19:00,3520,"Sounds like a great day,  fun report to read.  Spent over two years running around in Rangers over 20 years ago and love every minute of it.  It wasn't just about the speed though, it was also about the comfort of the ride while running and while fishing.  Also loved the storage on the boat.  "
497401,GBW,2010-08-23 17:24:00,8460,"A Junebug is worse, trust me..."
497417,mercman,2010-08-23 18:21:00,7054,"  OR A LOON MAYBE !!! lots of loons on the lake, i could just see showing up in emergency and having the nurse say. so what seems to be the problem. i have a loon in my face. how did you get a looney stuck in your face?? no, not a looney, a loon......"
497418,Pigeontroller,2010-08-23 18:22:00,2793,  I guess Bass boat owners are like Harley owners...They both are under the impression everyone wishes they had one too! I could afford either but would rather have neither!
497421,charlesn,2010-08-23 18:25:00,551," I guess some people are just that much smarter than everyone else that they can DEFINE ""what fishing is about"" for everyone and be sanctimonious towards anyone that falls outside of their definition.  Charles"
497424,ecmilley,2010-08-23 18:29:00,2163,"hey each to there own, I'll never own a deep-v or a tin boat again, i enjoy fishing from my bass boat to me it's perfect platform for what i do, now if i feel like towing hardware my buddy has a lund"
