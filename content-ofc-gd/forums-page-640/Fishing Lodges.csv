497086,kevinhiles,2010-08-22 17:34:00,22,I'm thinking about going to a fishing lodge with some buddies. Can anyone recommend a good one within 3 hours driving distance of Toronto?  We'd like to have access to a guide and a boat if possible.  Help is appreciated.  Thanks
497087,Terry,2010-08-22 17:39:00,14456,what do you want to fish for
497158,kevinhiles,2010-08-22 21:10:00,22,I'm kind of a newbie. The equipment I've been buying is more suited to bass or pike. So i would say that's what I'd be looking for.
497162,BillM,2010-08-22 21:24:00,17367,"3hrs from Toronto?  You might wanna increase that a bit, it will vastly increase your chance of catching better quality fish."
497167,solopaddler,2010-08-22 21:52:00,8605,"In the range of 4 hours and less from Toronto I'm partial to the lower French downstream from hwy 69.  These are water access camps. The outfitter picks you and your gear up at the marina and shuttles you to the lodge.  These places are both rustic but nice and in great fishing areas:  http://frenchriverlodge.com/  http://atwoodisland.com/   Another great option is Georgian Bay Fishing camp. It's on an island in the N/E corner of Georgian Bay where the French, Pickeral and Key rivers flow in.  Access is via the Key river down to the bay and across to the camp. They'll pick you up at the hwy if you don't have your own boat:  http://georgianbayfishing.com/"
497186,Handlebarz,2010-08-22 23:20:00,3790,Dad and I stayed at French River Lodge back in the early 90's it was amazing time up there and from what I here the fishing is just as good today.  If I were booking a place I would go to Tomiko lake lodge its just north of Sturegon falls home of the OFC BOSS and Tj also there is a lot of great bass fishing with some big pickerel I have only fished it on may 24 weekend but have friends who fish it all year and they do great. I don't know if they do guiding but you really don't need a guide as its not a large lake and there are great places to fish out of the wind if it gets tow rough out.Her brother lives up there or did and he is always out giving reports so that they can help you out. The prices are out of this world and Lisa takes great care of you. Just be sure to let her know you heard it from Mike from Chatham or Brad from Dover she will treat you great. I don't know if you will need a 4X4 to launch this time of the year or you could launch from the other lodge there. Contact her and see what there is to offer there.On thing to check and see is if there is a BBQ or bedding as she was getting out of Bedding and some of the BBQ's needed to be replaced i don't know if they were.  http://www.tomikolakelodge.com/

498005,Billy Bob,2010-08-24 22:22:00,5865,From what I have read the French River fishing has SUCKED this year until recently when it has really HEATED up with limit catches PLUS....  If you can afford this place you can't go wrong.....boats with new motors yearly and Indian guides. THE FOOD IS THE BEST you will EVER HAVE.  http://sandbeachlodge.com/  Bob
