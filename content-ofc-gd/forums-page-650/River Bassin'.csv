Yesterday, I decided to hit one on my way home and hopefully get the long weekend off to a good start.  With the heavy rains a few days ago, I thought the river would still be high and murky but it was pretty clear when I arrived so stealth would be the key.    I threw on the waders and wandered to my favorite trough and started casting.  With the weeds up in mid-summer, floating a crawler is a pretty good way of getting bait down to the fish without picking up too much salad with every cast.  Nice and natural too, with the clear water.  It didn't take long for the first fish to hit.  A little guy about a foot long that gave a good account of himself in the current.    A short time later, another Smallie about the same size as the first came out to play.    A nice fight, quick photo, and off she went.    Then, looking down into the water, I was nicely surpise by a visit from this fellow.  Not sure what kind of turtle it is( I'm gonna look it up )but it was pretty big, about 14-inches long.  Neat to see.    The Smallmouth weren't the only fish in the hood.  A few Sunnies came by to change things up yesterday.   I ended up catching about a dozen or so Smallies, however nothing of any bragging size, but that's fishing.  A great couple of hours and a good start to the long weekend, though.  Have a great long weekend and good fishing to everyone!  "

490239,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-01 11:59:00,0,Sounds like a few hours well spent to me. That looks like an old painted turtle but I'm not turtle expert.
490243,kyle7273,2010-08-01 12:10:00,65,"By the way, that turtle is a Red Eared Slider. Not native, likely an unwanted pet that someone released. Many people don't realize how big those little twonie sized turtles in the pet stores will get."
490260,Mike Pike,2010-08-01 12:45:00,1332,I'm thinking Red Eared Slider too Kyle.  Thanks for that.  It has a more pronounced red band higher on the head than a painted turtle.
