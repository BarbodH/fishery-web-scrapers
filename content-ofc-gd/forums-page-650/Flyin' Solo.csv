488091,danbouck,2010-07-24 23:23:00,4380,More of a photography report but here ya go.  I had the day off yesterday so later in the afternoon I headed down to the boat to do some evening fishing. I knew it was a gamble because of the weather but I had the chance for some R & R so I took it.  It poured down the whole way with lightning EVERYWHERE! I was about to turn around when I saw this      So I kept going and was rewarded with a couple hours of great weather. The bay on the other hand wasn't so nice lol! I went out a bit and decided to come back in since I was solo and I started casting at the dock.  I ran into a ton of these little guys.    I managed one decent pike but it decided to slip out of my hands before I got the camera. Did see a bunch of carp in the channel as well as a gold koi   The lighting in the distance was fantastic to watch so I did a bit of this for a while.    The sky was doing some weird things that was pretty interesting to watch. This one had me a little worried though    I hung out through it all and I was rewarded with these shots      I watched the insane lightning show over the lake and finally headed home around 10PM.

Were you using those for bait? I tell my kids, dangle your toes over the edge of the boat and don't be surprised if a snapping turtle thinks they are candy."
488108,danbouck,2010-07-25 00:04:00,4380, Funny you say that a couple weeks ago I had my feet in the water and a giant snapping turtle came out from under the dock!
