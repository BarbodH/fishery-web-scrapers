Going threw my lures I noticed a harness, I forgot I had! HEHE three other ones were sent off on the lonely lure venture!!!!!With fisherpete and spincast! So I rigged it up on a three way swivel bouncing off bottom, minnows attached.I felt a bump and wham gottem, then lost(Im sure it  was a walter).Oh well!!Next time! I proceeded to the other point and again the line triggered. A huge bucket mouth!!!!!5lbs plus!!!!!But stupid me I had my rod tip up and he gave the fin while tailwalking See ya sucker . Anyway, I continued on across the lake,marked a few and wham! AGAIN!A huge smallie! On one of the lonely lures,Gotta love it!MPB for this seasons smallie! A decision that paid off indeed! Pics on its way soon,on my thread of the lonely lures! I did feel obligated to use the spiner,since I started the thread on the adventures of the lonely lures! In that,since I caught and posted a fish(soon),I have to pass it on to another OFC member. Pm me if your interested,if your in the hammer area."
