486921,rstinson,2010-07-20 22:04:00,2,"... I'm headed up to Woseley Bay next week (French River) and wondered where I could get a decent map of the river (hydrographic/topographic) or whatever. Given my limited fishing experience, I need all the help I can get! I undertstand there is an outpost store off of 69, but would they carry decent maps of the French?"
486924,Pigeontroller,2010-07-20 22:12:00,2793,"There is a French River Prov. Park map that is excellent, basically a topo, no depths...Most canoe/paddling stores will carry it."
486925,Rich Clemens,2010-07-20 22:13:00,3131,"Rosti:  The French River Trading Post, along Rt 69, should have a map of the French River.   This will be on your left-hand side shortly after you cross the Pickeral and French Rivers on Rt. 69.   It will provide the outlines of the shorelines of the entire river, shows the various camps, rapids, etc.  I'm pretty sure there are no maps available that show water depths, shoals, etc., since this French is not considered a navitable water-way - or so I have heard before.  I have a couple of these and gets to be quite large when you open it all the way up.  If you are staying at a lodge, they may have one of their own.  I stay at Wolseley Lodge and the owners have a little self-made map with some of the fishing ""hotspots"" marked for their general area."
487261,rstinson,2010-07-21 20:19:00,2,..Sounds good - I will explore both options. Thanks. Rosti
489927,stubbex1,2010-07-30 16:44:00,164,I have been trying to find a decent map of the french as well.  This is what I have found and ordered. http://www.fedpubs.com/mpchrt/maps/french_river.htm  I'll post back on here when i recieve it in the mail!!
489937,Rich Clemens,2010-07-30 17:13:00,3131, That appears to be the same map that I had purchased from the French River Trading post. At least - based on the pic I saw on the website.
489954,stubbex1,2010-07-30 17:41:00,164,"I wondered if it would be the same Rich, as there appears to be a limited publishing of maps on the French.  How do you like it? Do you find it helpfull?  Please tell me you didn't pay $3.99 for it at the trading post"
490002,DanD,2010-07-30 19:32:00,2223,Would this be of any use to you? It’s an interactive map where you can zoom in and navigate to different areas and then print off what you want.  http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map?mapsize=850+666&scale=300000.000000&mapxy=1151158.9373001728+-172976.52871906053&mode=zoomin&layers=other_features%20million_grid%20t50k_grid%20grid_50k_3%20roads%20hydrography%20boundary%20builtup%20vegetation%20populated_places%20railway%20power_network%20manmade_features%20designated_areas%20water_features%20water_saturated_soils%20relief%20contours%20toponymy%20contour%20nodata_ntdb_50k&hidetextbox=  Dan.
490030,Rich Clemens,2010-07-30 21:58:00,3131,"  I primarily use it to check out 'potential' spots and overall layout of the river, bays, and such.  Beyond that, I really don't use it much.  I'm sure I paid over 10.00, but I don't recall now.  The one I have in the house here doesn't have a price written on it."
490032,Rich Clemens,2010-07-30 22:01:00,3131,  Thanks Dan. A little more detail than the French River map as this interactive ones has some of the rocks marked.  Some I recognize as I zomed into the Wolseley Bay area.
490063,DanD,2010-07-31 00:03:00,2223,Thanks Rich; but I shouldn’t take the credit for the link to that site. I believe it was Roy or one of the other long time posters that gave up the Web site here about a year or so ago? I’ve used it quite a bit looking at all the places I would love to go to and fish.  Dan.
