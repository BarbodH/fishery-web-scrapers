490215,Mattones,2010-08-01 04:29:00,587,yeah kill them. The girlfriend makes me do it.
490216,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 04:32:00,0,Ya you really have to kill these little nasty critters or no more perch for you and ur wife. They are eating the bass eggs etc. The only way to kill them is to bite their heads off and burn the bodies................. ........ joke my friend just crush'em or toss them onto land
490217,toca,2010-08-01 04:57:00,274,they make great bait
490250,4thgen,2010-08-01 12:28:00,157,"You're supposed to kill them but they are so well established already that you are only taking a handful out of a population of millions, probably more. So don't feel bad about letting them go, at this point killing them would just be for the sake of killing and not much else. Might as well get used to them, they're here to stay..."
