Prior to this, the biggest fish I had caught was about two pounds (discovered fishing the end of last summer) on the Ottawa and Rideau Rivers. The treble hook in a 4 pounder was in its mouth in such a way I could not get my thumb in to hold it. I used instead my still to be christened ""Berkley TEC Pistol Trigger Grip"". The fish thrashed around jamming the grips while I quickly took the hook out. I had to bend back one of the jaws to release it unharmed. Have now read several customer reviews stating the same problem has occurred to them. I am now in the market for another grip BUT not a ""Berkley TEC Pistol Trigger Grip"". Heading up to Georgian Bay in two weeks.  Any recommendations?  Thanks,  Bill "
