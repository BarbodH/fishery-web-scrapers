Well I went to CT in Milton tonight just to ""see"" what they had. I had a budget in mind of $100. When I got there, the selection was not that great, but I saw this puppy and I thought it was kismet:  http://www.epinions.com/review/Abu_Garcia_Cardinal_500_Spinning_Reel/content_348641398404  Who says history never repeats? From all accounts it seems like a pretty good reel for the money. I paid $70 (could have got it at BPS for $60 if I wanted to drive half hour each way on the 407 which would have cost me more than $10, not to mention the obligatory $100 in ""extras"" that always follow me out of BPS)  The wife and kids are heading out of town for an overnighter tomorrow. Can't wait to try this puppy out!!"
