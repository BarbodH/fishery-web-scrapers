I am thinking about a weekend getaway to go Bass fishing was just looking on Google. The Long Point area looks like interesting water at least from the Google map. What do you guys think? Are there any good places to stay for a weekend in that area? What about boat rentals or charters? Any info would be helpful. The idea of going into the wildlife park to do some photography also has some interest for me.  Bill"
