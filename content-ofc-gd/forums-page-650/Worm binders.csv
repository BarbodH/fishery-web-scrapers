The Plano ones I have are ok but don't have as mutch storage for the hooks etc and I have one or 2 pouches with the ziplocs separating from the bags, The Storm ones I have are garbage, although in all fairness they are much smaller sized than the others, and I only bought them due to the price (impusle buy! not what I needed)  jjcanoe"
