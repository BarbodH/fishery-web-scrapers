I was wondering if you guys could give me some tips for those of you that have experience fishing this area.  I have only really fished for smallmouth  in the St. Clair river, and all we do there is drag lizards along the bottom with a texas rigged setup.  my question is, what sort of setup would work best in Lake St. Clair??  I wont be able to have the boat conrtol for dropshotting, so that will be out of the question.  I have been told to start out near the XE2 buoy and fish 10'-15' of water.  Any tips and help would be appreciated...thanks in advance."
