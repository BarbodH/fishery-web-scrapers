489824,fish_fishburn,2010-07-30 09:56:00,1311,Theres a huge marsh I fish for largies in my neck of the woods with lots of largies 5lbs plus and the bullfrogs are veery territorial and agressive. They will chase anything that comes near them. Maybe thats why the largies are so big.

489845,jediangler,2010-07-30 12:09:00,1923,Was he a screamer?  
489847,crappieperchhunter,2010-07-30 12:14:00,2582,That's a beauty. Got one at the cottage near that size....my mission this summer is to catch him when my grandson is around.  Years ago I caught one on a little lake off a Ranger road up on the Bruce. When I held it in my hand it's back legs hang down past my elbow. I have never seen another one close to the size of that bugger
489874,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-30 14:06:00,0,"Ya Ive caught some pretty huge ones, this guy was just out on the street in front of the house, another was hit by a car,looked like ground beef. My place backs onto a golf course here in NOTL and they are coming from the ponds, seen some small bass flipping around out there too.."
