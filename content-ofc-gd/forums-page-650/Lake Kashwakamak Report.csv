The fishing was tough, caught a bunch a smaller bass, one eater size walleye (Tasted great), and a couple of small Pike. Last year when I was up there I caught an blue/silver pike and was told that there pretty rare...well I caught another one   I go up to lake K once or twice a year and 2 silver/blue pike in 2 trips seems like alot eh? It's a bue pike factory I tells ya! I didn't take a lot of pics but heres some... ""Got enough beer for two nights dad?"" ""You're right...we should get some whiskey""         Blue Pike      Last Years Blue Pike      -Ben"

489769,Ben_Daniels,2010-07-30 02:16:00,435,"The Steamwhistle is a great beer and a great company, I converted my dad who's been drinking Heineken for years but now prefers the Steamwhistle hands down, its only got 4 ingredients! Now that I'm looking at my pics, I'm thinking I caught the same pike two years in a row...Look at the horizontal white line by its eye... Could it be? If so catch and release sure does work!  -Ben"
489806,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-30 04:29:00,932,"Great report and nice looking Blue Pike - awesome fish!  That poor fish is probably craving a cigarette now of the second hand smoke lobby has anything to say about it  and  Catch & Release works . . . period.  It has been proven time and time again.  I'm sure I'm repeatedly catching some of the same fish, and I know for certain that I caught the same brown 3 times this spring."
