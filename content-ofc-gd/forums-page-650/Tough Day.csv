490165,toca,2010-08-01 00:07:00,274,What Kind Of Fish Is That?  Some Kind Of White Fish?
490171,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 00:37:00,0,"  I was thinkin it was a white bass but i dont think so, its Lake Gibson so I say its a mutant . Im sure someone will have the answer....."
490172,TC1OZ,2010-08-01 00:39:00,987,Sheepshead.  I still haven't caught one!~
490182,hunterjoe84,2010-08-01 01:34:00,52,definitely a sheepshead  caught many of those on lake erie
490196,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 02:48:00,0,"Sheephead it is and it was a fun little fight, now I can add thatto my belt........ 1st one."
490244,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-01 12:16:00,0,Better than nothing. I didn't know there were sheeps head on Gibson Lake??? this is the lake on hwy 69?
490253,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 12:31:00,0,"The only hwy's I knoe are Hwy 50, 67 and the 406 that run right over lake gibson in the town of the Thorold. Lake Erie and the welland canal flow through this lake. Fish should not be eating out of here......."
490303,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-01 15:45:00,0, The Gibson lake I know is up north near Georgian bay. Different lake. Thanks
490307,livinisfishin,2010-08-01 15:53:00,661,I thought that's was pretty weird to when I read gibson lake...but different one. Good job on adding another notch to your belt!
490308,siwash,2010-08-01 15:54:00,683,That kind of threw me off too... Gibson in Muskoka should not have sheep head unless someone dumped them in there
490326,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 17:43:00,0,Id rather be fishing the GB area but this is it what I got close to me....... Do people even eat sheepheads?
490331,Spiel,2010-08-01 18:21:00,9065,"  People do eat 'em, I don't.  "
490334,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-01 18:24:00,0,Ya I will be skipping out on eating that too
490414,kyle7273,2010-08-02 03:45:00,65,"We tried some on a trip to Nippising recently, no so good, but they are one heck of a strong fighter when hooked."
490422,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-02 05:06:00,0,"  Really? Whats it like? Are they hard to clean. The fight was nice, I guess if the Pike or Bass arent gonna hit i will take a Sheephead on"
490484,Frank,2010-08-02 15:15:00,74,"I have caught hundreds of sheephead a.k.a freshwater drum in Lake Erie,Lake Ontario Welland Canal, Welland River and Grand River. Many people do take them home for consumption, I personally never would, but then again I don't keep anything from anywhere. Sheephead are a fun and easy fish to target and I have seen some big ones come out of the lakes, a quick google search ""Lake Erie Sheephead"" will show you how big these guys can get."
490664,Fish Farmer,2010-08-02 23:12:00,2234,"Don't knock Sheephead, you insult my favorite GAME fish, my feelings are hurt  . I'd sooner catch one big Sheephead than 10 of those drag-in-dead-BOQ Nov. Dec. Walleye boots that hundreds of anglers pursue, I still can't figure why I go after those BOQ boots  Maybe it's the camaraderie after, back at the Motel  and me telling the guys about my Sheaphead battles.  I knew a couple guys that loved to eat Sheephead. One guy told me you couldn't beat them. He filleted them, cut the filet's up in strips and dropped the strips in boiling water with 1 cup of salt added, scoop the strips out as soon as they turn white and put on ice, take the strips and dip in Shrimp sauce. He called them poor-man-Shrimp. I know Spiel, you just couldn't resist sending me this thread"
