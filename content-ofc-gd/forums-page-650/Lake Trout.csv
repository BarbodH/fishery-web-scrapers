490573,jtuffedge,2010-08-02 19:05:00,6,Once a year I travel to Ontario for a fly in trip.  We don't generally spend much time catching Lake Trout but I want to do it more this year.  We use a 4oz or 5oz weight along with a 3 way swivel and catch them trolling around 100 feet deep.  Is it best to use a heavy rod like a Musky rod or something a little softer?  I appreciate the help.  John Arlington Texas

I used my 7'6"" flippin stick and it worked out just right. 12 lb test to a small lucky strike gang troll and we trolled frozen 3 ft behind in a meat rig. Simple rig and worked out real well"
