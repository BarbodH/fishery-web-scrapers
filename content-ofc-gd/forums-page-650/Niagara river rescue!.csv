490642,lew,2010-08-02 21:57:00,12766,"Link doesn't work here either but I caught part of the story on Global. Sounds like they were near the railway bridge just downstream from the Peace Bridge when the boat sunk. Pretty sure they said there were 11 people on board but they all got rescued safely.  As I say though, I only caught part of the story but I think that was the jist of it."
