The 21-foot Zodiac came to rest at the intersection of Cundles Road and Livingstone Street West around 8:30 a.m., July 14.  No other vehicles were involved and no one was injured.   A long-time male employee of the police department who was driving the vehicle has been charged under the Highway Traffic Act with failing to secure a load.  Police say a secondary chain attaching the boat to the trailer had not been secured.  The boat was sent to CO2 Inflatables in Oakville for repairs, but the bill amount was not available on Thursday.  The Zodiac is back in the water and will be patrolling the lake for this weekend's Kempenfest.  ""It's all set to go,"" said Const. Rob Adam, adding damage to the boat wasn't as significant as initially believed.  The boat was being prepared for its summer duties when the incident occurred. It was due to be launched into Lake Simcoe at the Barrie Marina."
