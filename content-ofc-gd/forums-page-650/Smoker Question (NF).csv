489835,Jay T,2010-07-30 11:24:00,282,"I am having a get together this weekend and I am kind of new to smoking (I have done some fish before), I am doing a beef roast, pork roast and a turkey breast in the smoker. What wood would taste best with all of them cooking at once? I have Cherry, Apple, Hickory and Mesquite, I was thinking a apple cherry mix? Also how should they be prepared? What has worked and tasted best for any of you?  Thanks  Jay"
