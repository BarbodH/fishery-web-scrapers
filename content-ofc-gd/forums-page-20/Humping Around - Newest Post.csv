When you are on a fly-in with limited time that makes sense.  I fish a small lake up in Greenstone that has Walleye and pike and the Walleye are rarely found more than 50 yards away from a very small point of land. The strange part of this is that there are no discerning features on the depthfinder that would indicate a good fishing spot. I bet many of those fly in lakes are similar in nature.  As much as I dislike trolling for Walleye, it can be an effective way to find those types of spots.  It's true that 90% of the fish are in 10% of the lake.."
