1071645,Big Cliff,2021-03-31 10:36:00,6899,"Last week I reached out to Zoombaits, a while back someone had given me a package of one of their products, limetruse plastic worm. My son and I really liked the product but I hadn't been able to find more and we were almost out of them. I sent Zoombaits an email telling them about our success and explaining I was looking for a Canadian supplier. I got a very brief email back suggesting I contact a vendor in Virginia Beach. A follow up email from me explaining I was looking for a Canadian supplier has gone un answered.Â  It's a great product but by the time I pay exchange, freight and potentially brokerage it's going to be a real PIA."

1071664,Ronzo,2021-03-31 17:24:00,124,"I found this site,Â https://5aught.ca/catalogue-suppliers.php?Zoom Bait Company&supplier=76Â , that seems to carry Zoom worms. Checked the reputation, not a lot of information around, but does not seem like a scam site."
1071665,Big Cliff,2021-03-31 17:37:00,6899,"I am sure, ðŸ˜ž"
1071666,OhioFisherman,2021-03-31 17:48:00,6623,"Not sure if that is the one you want, but it shows them in that color. Your average local tackle store can't stock every item, but a good one may be able to order an item for you? That link didn't work?"
1071667,Big Cliff,2021-03-31 17:48:00,6899,"Thanks, I have sent them an email, hopfully I can purchase them locally, well at least from Canadian based supplier"
1071668,Big Cliff,2021-03-31 17:52:00,6899,"Thanks, I realize that smaller local shops can't carry everything but I would have thought that the manufacturer could give me the name (s) of some Canadian distributors, I did provide my full name and address."
1071678,GBW,2021-04-01 02:24:00,8460,"Cliff, worst case, try Jerry on Queen St in Lindsay to see if he can get them if you're still having a hard time."
1071679,GBW,2021-04-01 02:30:00,8460,"PS, seems like the CTC in Barrie has a few packs left online shopping I found them.Â Â https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/zoom-trick-worm-lure-6-1-2-in-1780998p.html Maybe call and ask them to grab all the remaining stock and hold them for you??"
1071680,GBW,2021-04-01 02:31:00,8460,"Also, Amazon.ca.Â Â https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Zoom+Trick+Worm&ref=nb_sb_noss_2"
1071681,GBW,2021-04-01 02:34:00,8460,Oh andÂ Peterborough Pro Tackle sell's Zoom and so does Walmart.Â  Walmart is great for blowing out old stock for next to nothing.
1071684,Big Cliff,2021-04-01 08:23:00,6899,"Thanks Geoff, really appreciate the effort, there seems to be quite a few places that sound promissing but that one color in that particular style is elusive"
1071688,T-Bone,2021-04-01 12:28:00,160,"You want a very specific brand of a very specific bait, in a very specific color, only from a CA distributor, and are complaining about an email not being responded to? Sounds like you're setting yourself up for a frustrating PIA from the beginning. Yes, buying local is always preferred, but for products marketed worldwide and sold via hundreds (or thousands) of reseller channels...it really doesn't matter where you get it from. The paper-thin profit from 10 packs or even 100 packs of those worms is not moving the revenue needle for whomever you buy it from. "
1071693,mamona,2021-04-01 14:15:00,597,Forget about Amazon. It is way overpriced nowadays.
1071738,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-02 21:11:00,720,Agreed  And they are massively profiting from covid while our little shops suffer.
