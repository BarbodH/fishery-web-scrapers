1071720,Northerner1212,2021-04-01 22:56:00,23,Looking to by a nav card for my new fish finder it’s a lowrance elite fs I’m not sure what card is better c-maps or navionics has anyone had any experience with these cards ?
1071726,porkpie,2021-04-02 15:20:00,2521,I’ve used Navionics for many years.  It’s was decent to start and I find them  pretty good in Ontario waters these days.  Occasionally they are way off but for me that’s been the exception not the rule.  No experience with the other one.
1071756,fisherman7,2021-04-03 13:57:00,325,Has anyone ever updated their card? Is it worth it? Mine's about 10 years old and I'm on Upper Buckhorn Lake. Can't imagine it's changed that much.
1071764,AKRISONER,2021-04-03 17:36:00,5558,Chat with dave Chong about this. He’s got the scoop on navionics
1071799,BillM,2021-04-05 12:19:00,17367,Probably not worth it.    Do you have 1ft contours?   If not then it might be worth the upgrade.
1072865,KawarthaAngler,2021-04-30 13:44:00,273,I'm on Upper Buckhorn as well.  I've never found a reason to update the maps for the Kawartha's.  I have the Navionics on my phone and do the annual subscription so that it updates (it's pretty cheap compared to the Nav chips in our fish finders).
1072905,Canuck,2021-05-02 16:40:00,491,"I have navionics on my old Raymarine C80 and I upgrade every couple of years in case the Coast Guard moves any buoys.  Yeah you can see them, but I would rather have the charts close to the actual locations.  I like Navionics better than C-map because it looks exactly the same on the iPhone, iPad and the Raymarine."
