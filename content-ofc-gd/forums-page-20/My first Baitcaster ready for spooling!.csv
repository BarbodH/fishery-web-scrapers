1071969,dave524,2021-04-11 12:39:00,4508,"I use a different grip on a baitcaster handle when casting as compared to retrieving and reeling, usually palming the reel in an upfaced left palm and reeling with my right hand, but then again I learned back in the old offset pistol grip days. "
1071649,AKRISONER,2021-03-31 13:17:00,5558,"Hell don’t confuse the guy lol bloody bass weirdos switching hands with bait casters still to this day is wild lol. I still don’t understand why people do this, but then again, go down south and watch how guys cast. You can tell they fish a heck of a lot in the trees. I could swear to god the guys on santee don’t even know how to sidearm or overhead cast. They flip everything from crankbaits to dropshots!"
1071659,siwash,2021-03-31 15:35:00,683,I choose a lefty reel. Usually go right with spinning got advice to go left. Hope that was correct info!!  my yard is pretty big so I should be go to go to practice back there.
1071661,misfish,2021-03-31 16:10:00,29133,"Spinning and float/fly reels I reel left hand,cast with right . Bait caster,  the opposite.  LOL"
1071663,siwash,2021-03-31 17:17:00,683,"Oh no, now I'm confused! 😂"
1071669,OhioFisherman,2021-03-31 18:27:00,6623,"Basically it's just a comfort thing, I am right handed, but all my reels were left hand retrieve, and all the baitcasters I learned on were right hand retrieve."
1071674,AKRISONER,2021-03-31 22:56:00,5558,"So try to keep this short...but guys that started baitcasting would cast and then switch hands to then reel. don’t ask my why they do this especially these days now that both handed baitcasters are available (back in the day reels only came one way) to this day it makes no sense to me, but with both handed baitcasters now available I think people that fish in this old traditional method will slowly disappear. I personally cannot reel comfortably with my left hand, so for me to have right handed spinning reels and then left handed casters makes no sense at all. I want to reel with my right hand all of the time so I do that. I guess some right handed folks never feel comfortable controlling their spool while baitcasting using their left hand, hence they want to control the spool with their dominant hand even if it means that they then have to reel with their left hand which is sometimes the opposite of the hand that they use for reeling spinning gear. im a real weirdo and it’s probably because of hockey? But I’m right handed in all things but hockey and batting while playing baseball and golf. Hence I can actually control a fishing rod comfortably with both hands. But don’t ask me to cast a rod from my right side, it feels super akward...unless that is of course while I am fly casting...because I fly cast right handed...I’m a mess lmao"
1071677,kickingfrog,2021-03-31 23:55:00,8333,"30 Years ago just about all bait casters had the handle on the right side and it's only been about 20 years that left handle (used mostly by right handers) have been readily available across multiple brands. I think this is from the time of the old level wind reels, the belief was that the dominate hand should be used turn the handle. For most of us using our dominate hand to power the cast (top hand on the rod) or to one hand cast makes sense. Then, for most, we prefer to use our dominate hand to control the rod and impart action and our offhand just collects the line. The long time bait cast guys that learned when there was only one choice switch so fast and smooth that it really doesn't matter to them but it does stick out if you look for it."
1071695,Duckie,2021-04-01 15:07:00,305,"yup, when i learned how in 1998 shimano was just starting to release a few lefties but most companies had only righty's available.  so we cast and switched. tough to unlearn that once you get good."
1071707,OhioFisherman,2021-04-01 16:52:00,6623,"My first lefty was one like this, an Abu 5001c from 1971, it was the first lefty reel I had seen. Like because my first one had what they called grooved rims. A couple of years later I got another from Bass Pro Shops that had beveled rims like this one and a power handle."
1071713,BillM,2021-04-01 18:00:00,17367,I switch hands in the air with all my baitcasters.    I must be doing something wrong
1071717,woodenboater,2021-04-01 21:35:00,2277,"am right handed and cast with the right (spinning, bait cast and fly) but use left handed reels"
1071721,misfish,2021-04-01 23:31:00,29133,"Funny part with me is,when I am flipping, I have the rod in my right hand . After I set the hook,  I switch the rod to my left hand and reel in with my right.  And if you want to see a B.A.S.S pro right hand cast and switch to the left, I do a real good one. Almost looks like a cowboy throwing a laso rope. LOL"
1071913,siwash,2021-04-09 13:43:00,683,Hey guys - switching the topic up a little but still on the baitcaster; can I use old powerpro that's on a spinning reel to practice? I was thinking of spooling it into my new baitcaster.  I think it's 30 or 40 lbs test... it's a few years old and a touch faded but seems ok... maybe I'll strip off 10 or 20 yards then spool?
1071917,AKRISONER,2021-04-09 14:27:00,5558,thats a great idea...braid never really goes bad until its been worn and frayed from a lot of casting. Guys will even unspool reels with braid and then flip the line around and put the old stuff towards the backing and the stuff that hasnt been cast on a ton at the end.  Heavy braid thats 30-40lbs is also wayyy easier to cast. I think youve got yourself a good idea there.
1071921,lew,2021-04-09 14:39:00,12766,You've received some good advice here siwash but just remember that there's absolutely nothing mystical or difficult about a baitcaster and just think of it as another tool in the box and in no time you'll be firing baits all over the lake without thinking about. As someone mentioned before just snug down the tension a bit to start and gradually loosen it off as you get the hang of it. I had all my reels set up so that I could fire a bait as hard as I wanted and as soon as it touched the water the reel would stop spinning. As the weight on the different baits changed it just takes a slight adjustment and your good to go again. Just takes a bit of practice & you'll be golden.
1071922,dave524,2021-04-09 14:49:00,4508,"I recall seeing a lot of oldtimers in the 50's early 60's when spinners were becoming popular, cast a spinner with their right hand and then switch the rod to their left and reel backwards with the right with the reel sitting on top of the rod, talk about AFU. 🤣 edit: sometimes the reel was on a offset pistol grip handled baitcast rod"
1071923,siwash,2021-04-09 14:49:00,683,thank you!
1071924,siwash,2021-04-09 14:52:00,683,Thanks to all for the excellent and thoughtful advice! I will update you on my birdsnest count soon!!!! 😆
1071929,Mr Greedydrift,2021-04-09 16:47:00,25,"Baitcasters for me are a tricky thing. I like to cast baits far so I dial in the tension to do that. Then turn the boat into the wind to follow the weedline - backlash. Wind is a baitcasters enemy. This is where thumbing the spool as the line goes out is important. As for the right/left thing, here is my opinion- Spinning reel - left hand retrieve, float reel left hand, fly reel left hand, downrigging reel left hand, mooching reel left hand etc. Baitcaster - left hand retrieve. Why anyone would fumble around switching hands during a cast is something I will never understand. I once saw a buddy almost lose his musky rod when his reel backlashed while he was switching hands. I just think its a wasted movement.      "
1071931,OhioFisherman,2021-04-09 16:56:00,6623,"Depending on how and where you fish you probably don't need to fill the reel up with braided line, use some mono for backing."
1071963,BillM,2021-04-10 21:23:00,17367,"It's funny, I couldn't cast with my left arm even if I wanted to.  All casting is right hand dominant, doesn't matter if it's spinning, baitcast, float, fly, whatever.    I'll happily strip line and reel with my left hand if I'm fly fishing or float fishing or spinning.   But baitcasting, gotta use my right hand.   Doesn't matter if I'm tossing 1/4oz topwater for bass or Pounders for muskie.  Switch is always made in the air before the bait lands.   I've been doing that forever, I don't even notice it now.    I'm sure it looks odd to some."
1071964,captpierre,2021-04-10 23:24:00,2521,Use a heavier weight at the end of your line to practice. I stood on a picnic table at the park. A light lure will require a harder cast. This leads to a bird nest because of spool  over spin. IMO you need a magic thumb to cast light jigs with bait caster. For me a spinning reel is best for the light stuff.
1071966,siwash,2021-04-11 01:54:00,683,What about using lead weight?  like a 1/2 ounce?
1071967,captpierre,2021-04-11 01:56:00,2521,Sure. Sounds about right.
1071968,AKRISONER,2021-04-11 12:33:00,5558,"I would literally say the complete opposite. Not to toot my own horn here, But I also consider myself pretty decent with the caster. At least at casting. still learning precise underhand skipping with it. But I put the time in to practice it. (side note if you want to watch some baitcasting mastery, watch bassmaster live today and watch guys like Seth fieder flip baits those guys are fishing really really shallow right now and a guy like fieder is one of the best on the entire tour casting to lay downs etc.) the perfect example of this are with smaller crankbaits and square bills etc. Stuff that with a spinning set up just doesn’t fly, especially into the wind. With the caster I can still get them to go. the thumb is getting a workout though that’s for sure. But learning to cast on Georgian bay has been really really good for teaching me how to cast into the wind, there’s no other option when the wind is over 20kmh+ off of the lake every day in the summer."
1071529,siwash,2021-03-27 11:21:00,683,"Hey folks, A couple of months back I asks questions/recommendations about which baitcaster combo to buy - this is my first experience with them.  I ended up with a 6'8"" medium-heavy (medium-fast flex) Falcon rod (BuCoo SR) and the reel is an Abu Black Max.  Nothing special or overly complicated.  I figure it should serve me well for a few years before I feel the need to upgrade. Several of you had suggested practicing in the yard (after watching some YouTube vids).  I intend to do that now that the snow is gone and now I need to select some line. I believe most said go with MONO.  The rod is rated for 10-20lbs, 1/4 to 3/4 oz. Should I go with a 12lb mono?  I am a generalist and fish for everything from small mouth to pike to lake trout...  is that a good weight to go with? Is there a brand you prefer?  I like original Stren for my spinning outfits.. Also, should I generally tie a leader to that setup? 12lbs is heavier than what I'd fish with, for say SM bass..  Thanks for any suggestions!"
1071530,AKRISONER,2021-03-27 12:29:00,5558,"Get braid...wayyyy easier to learn on. 20 lb power pro. tie a leader to it for what you are fishing. Topwater, mono, a lot of other stuff fluro, slop for largies no lead"
1071531,Garnet,2021-03-27 12:55:00,2056,I would get mono 17lb. And cheap the Zebco OmniFlex at Wal Mart will work. About $3. Change baits or weights of often. Get all the cast in. When your thumb gets educated start backing the controls off.
1071532,GBW,2021-03-27 14:42:00,8460,Any cheap mono to start while pitching plugs around in the yard.  Mono cost's less too when having to cut a birdsnest out.
1071534,kickingfrog,2021-03-27 15:21:00,8333,"Mono is more forgiving when you are learning and cheaper to replace if you end up with the mother of all birds nests (I heard from a friend).  Pound test is a little more tricky and has a lot to do with rod/lure/conditions and preferences. The general rule of thumb is 10lb test mono is as thin as you should go, so 12-14 might be good for the fishing you described. If you do go with braid then 30lb test is about as thin as you should go (again, general rule of thumb) and does work for most of our inland fishing unless you are way back in the slop for bass or you are targeting big pike/muskie.  When fishing bass I don't bother with a leader except if I have braid and I'm looking for a little more stealth and tie on some flouro. If you run into pike while bass fishing then a beefier floor leader can help. I don't use wire leaders often but they can be handy if they don't dampen the action of your lure.  "
1071535,Northerner1212,2021-03-27 15:48:00,23,20 # power pro braid kinda set it and forget it kinda thing
1071536,misfish,2021-03-27 16:01:00,29133,"Flipp.n heavy cover,straight braid. It is a reaction bite. They will not notice the braid."
1071555,siwash,2021-03-27 22:13:00,683,Ok so mono seems to be the consensus. Should I eventually switch to braid once I learn?
1071556,siwash,2021-03-27 22:15:00,683,I don't fish for Lrg mouth and generally avoid the thick heavy cover. It's the one species I don't target and all catch are incidental for me.
1071558,kickingfrog,2021-03-27 23:08:00,8333,"You can, but don't have to. I think braid has a lot of advantages especially if you are looking for versatility from an outfit."
1071559,AKRISONER,2021-03-28 00:03:00,5558,"Honestly I think it’s a mistake to try and learn with mono. It’s far more difficult to cast mono and flurocarbon then braid. I think you should learn with braid, I find the birds nests easier to get out too. Just remember when you bird nest, do not pull on your line and tighten it! Just slowly lightly work it out like you are untying a really tight knot. Pick away at it slowly and it will come undone. Also I’ll mention that even the pros birdnest from time to time so don’t feel bad about it. Don’t start by casting directly into wind. Try to have the wind at your back at first. Make short smooth casts and get used of braking the line before it hits the water/ground and work up from there. honestly if you are super carefully with your birdnests and work at them you will almost never need to cut your line no matter how bad they are. Typically the only time I get birdnests now a days that are bad enough to cut is when I absolutely try to launch something a mile long and something strange happens like I bump the handle and close the spool somehow or my line had a knot around my rod and I’m not paying attention and try to launch my bait and it goes nowhere. Honestly the last time I birdnested so bad it had to be cut I cast so hard my line snapped and my lure went flying 100 yards into the lake  once you get the hang of it you will almost never go back. Trust me!"
1071561,LostAnotherOne,2021-03-28 01:11:00,956,"Whatever your comfortable with.  I use mono, but my bro uses braid.  It's a never ending argument.  Grab some cheap line with your first spool up and practice in your backyard or an open field.  If your practicing for the first time on water we'll have fun lol."
1071562,Weeds,2021-03-28 01:26:00,782,"I’m pretty much in full agreement with AKRI but I’d even suggest going with 50 pound braid. You can always dial it back later to 20 if you wish, just makes picking the knots out that much easier, and less frequent in my experience."
1071563,siwash,2021-03-28 01:53:00,683,Thanks guys! I appreciate all the helpful responses!
1071565,grimsbylander,2021-03-28 04:34:00,3016,"It’s spring and they’ll be bird nests everywhere! Lol Another vote for cheap mono. The only thing I’ll add is this...if you know someone that is proficient with a baitcaster, after you’re all spoiled up ask for a quick lesson. This could save you a boat load of trial and error not to mention fishing line."
1071566,Garnet,2021-03-28 10:40:00,2056,Mono is just a starting point. You have a life time to try other lines. And lb test. Have fun and judge it on smiles after you get threw the misery.
1071586,greyhawk,2021-03-29 16:26:00,33,"Find a YouTube presentation on how to fine tune your Abu black max for the weight your will be practice casting. It will go a long way to mitigate many bird nests. Personally, I would use 30lb braid. You will be amazed at its efficacy!"
1071592,siwash,2021-03-29 19:34:00,683,Thanks. For braid would you go with PowerPro?
1071623,woodenboater,2021-03-30 22:34:00,2277,"if you start with braid, I'd suggest getting a picker for working out the bird's nest you're going to have."
1071630,siwash,2021-03-31 01:16:00,683,A picker??? Just realized I have old Powerpro on a spinning outfit.. either 30 or 40lbs (i think 30...) - should be alright to use old braid for practice?  its a few years old... a bit faded.  
1071632,Terry,2021-03-31 01:31:00,14456,"When you start out with a bait caster make the best cast you can , then peel out another 30 ft of line and put 4 inches of electrical tape on the spool and reel it back in. It will stop bird nests and as you learn to cast better you just put the tape a little deeper.  This is the best way to learn"
1071633,siwash,2021-03-31 01:34:00,683,"Oh wow, that's interesting! Ok.. will try that. So cut a 4"" piece and stick it on in the same direction as the line comes off the spool ?"
1071634,Terry,2021-03-31 01:37:00,14456,Yes you don’t make it too tight if you manage a real far cast the line will peel the tape off so you don’t lose the cast and you just put the tape  back on
1071635,siwash,2021-03-31 01:39:00,683,👍
1071648,Duckie,2021-03-31 12:42:00,305,when i started learning in 1998 I used to take the hooks off of a Rat L trap and practice casting either on my street or a local park with 12 pound mono.  22 years later I still use 12 pound mono (I like Sufix Siege) lol After a while you will be so good you will cast and switch hands without even thinking about it (often before the lure even hits the water) (assuming you are using a classic righty reel)  Good luck and practice practice practice off the water first so by the time you hit the water you are confident.  have fun!
