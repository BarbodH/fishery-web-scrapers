1072617,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-25 15:31:00,720,"Hey guys, I’m considering buying another device to add to my helix 7  DI SI. I love the helix, but I find it small in split screen modes (sonar + nav) I was debating getting a gps enabled android 7-10” tablet in a contractor case and dash mount for Navionics alone but I hear the sun can overheat them. I don’t need another all purpose device and I’d prefer not to break the bank if possible. I’d like to stay under $500 if possible  any ideas?"
1072619,BillM,2021-04-25 16:19:00,17367,Sell the Helix 7 and add that $500 in for a Helix 10-12.    This really is going to be your best bet.
1072621,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-25 16:25:00,720,Thanks I’m looking into that. I think I’d be more like $1500 out of pocket if I wanted SI DI Nav?
1072622,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-25 16:26:00,720,Maybe I could buy another Helix 7 w/o SI I’ve seen them around $550
1072625,BillM,2021-04-25 16:58:00,17367,A G2N Helix 10/12 would do you just fine.  No need for a G3N/G4N
1072626,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-25 16:59:00,720,Thanks I’ll look into that.
1072632,porkpie,2021-04-25 21:42:00,2521,I’ve been running two 7 inch screens for 4 years now.  I really prefer this.  I like having 2 transducers and 2 units capable of nav/fish finder in case one craps out.  I had this happen once when my transducer ripped from its mount and the water pressure broke the ducer cable.  I was down rigging for kings and If I hadn’t had 2 fully functioning sonars my trip would’ve been over.
1072645,fishdawg,2021-04-26 01:44:00,912,I like pork pies suggestion Also good luck finding a new Helix bigger than 7 inches
1072646,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-26 03:14:00,720,Supply and demand shortages?
1072649,Garnet,2021-04-26 11:10:00,2056,Have you tried making fish  finder screen little smaller and nav screen bigger.
1072701,fishdawg,2021-04-27 01:28:00,912,Yes You could get lucky tho.. happy hunting
1072702,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-27 03:16:00,720,"Yup, thanks. I mean it works, and I love it, i really want both sonar or imaging AND nav or the chart full size. a) because it is so much easier to read, and b) I find I scroll through screen selections quite a bit. I haven’t been able to figure out favourite presets on it. I think that’s Solex features? maybe another 7 is the ticket. I can set each as wanted, and I could also grab and move one to the front as needed? I’d have to buy an extra power cord and ducer. That just hit me. "
1072704,fishindevil,2021-04-27 09:56:00,6254,i run 3 helix gn2 on my lund 2 on the bow and 1 on console the 2 up front i use 1 for just chart and the 1 attached to my ulrext is for mega down imaging like bill said invest in another unit and you will be all set....
