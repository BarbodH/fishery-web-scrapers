1071166,porkpie,2021-03-12 04:51:00,2521,Thanks all for the input good or bad.  I’ve been pretty happy with my ford but just want something different.  I think I’m looking more towards the hemi in the warlock trim at this point.
1071171,pike slayer,2021-03-12 12:10:00,1177,The warlock with the hemi is a solid truck and probably the best price being a classic model.
1071189,misfish,2021-03-12 19:23:00,29133,Get the yella one.
1071202,porkpie,2021-03-13 01:30:00,2521,That’s a bit too flashy for me brother lol.
1071207,John,2021-03-13 13:07:00,2956,"I was a Ford guy through and through. Had 3 F150's in recent years. Last two gave me sleepness nights. Both had V6 Ecoboosts. Between undiagnosed misfires and electronics that would go blank and reset while driving. I also know at least 3 friends who have had problems with 2018/2019 F150's with 5L. Huge oil consumption. I assume that Ford has fixed the issue with 2020/2021 models. So, I went to the dark side. Bought a 2019 RAM Rebel with the Hemi. Love it so far. Put over 30K on it and not a squeak. Gas mileage around town is not quite as good as the V6 Eco, but with the trailer or boat on it's night and day. The twin turbos were forever kicking in on the Ford and mileage went down. On an East coast trip I was averaging around 25L/100Km. Unless something unforeseen happens I intend to keep this truck 'till either it dies or I do...or, maybe a RAM TRX if I will the lottery..🙂😁"
1071220,porkpie,2021-03-13 16:19:00,2521,"Yeah the eco booms have been nothing but trouble for a couple friends that had them, and we had them in explorers at work and they went down often enough there too.  I’m still rocking the old 4.6 and it’s been a great combo.  Not tons of power but it’s been a reliable ride and tows anything I want to perfectly.  My buddy is on his second Coyote powered ford and hasn’t had any issues.  I’m surprised to hear that guys have had trouble but I guess anyone can make a lemon.  I always thought Ford was pretty good with 5.0’s."
1071260,John,2021-03-15 14:50:00,2956,Yeah Ford was very aware that they had issues with Coyote 2018's. A couple of members of this board found out first hand. Some 5L's were burning a litre every 1000Km's. They seemed to get it under control in 2019.
1071264,porkpie,2021-03-15 15:47:00,2521,Well that’s no good!
1071474,porkpie,2021-03-24 13:08:00,2521,"To close this out, I have a 21 1500 classic Hemi Warlock in the driveway.  I like it quite a bit, although to get one in stock I had to get quite a few more options than I ever would have, it sure is nice having heated seats and auto start though.  So more stuff to break.  It was a sad day leaving the old F150 on the lot.  It was a good truck.  I couldn’t quite sell myself on the V6 although I nearly pulled the trigger on one with 3.55 gearing.  Here’s hoping it does well.  If it’s in the shop much during warranty I’ll be moving it along no doubt."
1071641,siwash,2021-03-31 06:57:00,683,"I'm dreaming of a Ram for my next vehicle.. I've never actually owned a pickup before but know many who have and those who own/owned Rams had few if any issues - with the V8.. but the one guy who owned an eco diesel did have major issues, so it seems like their Pentastar and V8 is fine.. just steer clear of the diesels..."
1071642,siwash,2021-03-31 06:59:00,683,"Btw, what are the Ford and GM diesel products like? Any issues?"
1071670,porkpie,2021-03-31 19:25:00,2521,I had a 1997 Chevy 1500 that gave me good service and is one of my favourite body styles and drives of any 4x4 truck I’ve ever been in.  I had 11 good years out of my 2010 F150 that replaced the Chevy and I had very few issues.  So either way I really couldn’t say one was better or worse than the other.  Both where gassers.  I can’t speak much to the diesels but a buddy of mine did have a Ford 6 litre diesel circa 2006 that ate a couple of head gaskets and gave him some trouble.  He plowed with it and used it as a work truck though so it didn’t lead an easy life.  I thought I’d try the dodge this time and see what happens.
1071902,ch312,2021-04-09 02:43:00,1590," I have an 07 1500 with Hemi and 140,000kms. At 110k I replaced all of the ball joints, tie rod ends, sway bar links, wheel bearings and serviced the calipers. New steering shaft to tighten her up and it felt like a new truck. 3/4 of parts were still good, but I needed an excuse to finally wrench on it. Body is starting to show visible rust. Whatever, at 14 years old it's to be expected. Solid truck that gets worked hard. I will definitely buy another."
1071912,siwash,2021-04-09 13:40:00,683,"Owes ya nothing at 14!! Good to know...  they've won ""truck of the year"" three consecutive years... FWIW"
1070883,porkpie,2021-03-03 00:03:00,2521,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm kicking around the idea of a Ram truck...  I've been a Ford guy for the last 11 years, and before that had a Chevy.  Neither have owed me anything.  Is anyone here towing with the 3.6L pentastar V6?  I'm pulling 3500lbs fully loaded with gear and gas.  I will  never pull more than that unless it's a one off, and I won't be getting 2 footitis any time soon as this boat is as big as I'll ever need.  My starcraft is a bit of a kite with high sides, but the  4.6L I'm currently pulling with has always been plenty.  It looks like the Pentastar makes more HP and just slightly less torque than my current engine.  The furthest I'll tow the big boat is to North Bay on a semi regular basis, but I'm planning to leave my tin boat up there this summer so I won't pull my big boat up all the time.  Otherwise I travel weekly to lake Erie or Ontario which can be up to  a solid 2 hour run for me.  I'm also looking at the Ford 3.3.  I won't buy an ecoboom as we had a bunch of failures in the vehicles at work so that's out entirely.  When I'm not towing it's a daily driver with a 20 minute commute, and the most I'll haul otherwise is an ATV in the back or a double sled trailer from time to time.  I'm questioning the need for a V8 with the tech that's available.   Anyway, thoughts on those who've towed with the current generation V6's are appreciated.  Input from mechanics on these engines and drivelines also appreciated.  I think this is fishing related as my primary concern is towing my fishing boat!"
1070885,Terry,2021-03-03 00:48:00,14456,I would say I have towed that much weigh with mine. And had no problems towing. However all the great gas mileage goes to hell in a hand basket when towing
1070887,Cosmos,2021-03-03 02:53:00,588,"Towing my 17,5 foot princecraft with mine - no issues. Served me well for last 5 years. Terry advised me on that truck. Fuel economy is pretty good too. I am doing around 14 litres per 100 km from Innisfil to French river and back."
1070889,porkpie,2021-03-03 03:50:00,2521,"Thanks fellas, I’m not worried too much about mileage while towIng.  It’s all the rest of the driving where it  matters.  I’m just concerned that it will pull the weight without issue."
1070892,Woodsman,2021-03-03 04:11:00,1286,"I have a 2014 Jeep Wrangler. The 3.6. I like the motor but yes towing does drop the gas mileage. A couple to three extra litres per 100 k isn't unusual. And the Wrangler isn't the greatest mileage to start with. I pull a trailer with a snowmobile or an atv, Sometimes a tent trailer."
1070893,misfish,2021-03-03 09:37:00,29133,"I have yet to tow anything with mine,but if you want to save mileage bud,you can leave it here and that will help on the mileage a bit. I promise to wave wash it on the weekends."
1070896,misfish,2021-03-03 10:10:00,29133,"Not if you let the wife drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1070900,fisherman7,2021-03-03 12:58:00,325,I've had the 3.6L in two vans and then my 2016 Ram. I towed my 17' G3 and I had no problems. My new Ram has the 5.7L Hemi. Only difference I really notice is the gas mileage. Way better with the 3.6. So next truck I will go back to the 3.6L.
1070909,LostAnotherOne,2021-03-03 14:31:00,956,I picked up one of those last July.  Brand new 2020.   I’m really glad I choose the V6 over the Hemi.  Zero issues towing my 14’ boat or flatbed.
1070913,mamona,2021-03-03 15:13:00,597,So what about V6 towing 25' RV trailer?
1070914,Cosmos,2021-03-03 15:42:00,588,I think it might be overkill for it. Towing is 5000 lb.
1070915,DanD,2021-03-03 16:12:00,2223,"All you guys with the 3.6 engine; don't let the guy changing your oil filter, over torque the filter cap. The torque spec is only 18 Ft. Lbs. Over tightening the cap could cause the lower housing to crack; creating a fairly large oil leak; that will run from the crack, under the intake manifold and then run out the back of the engine, socking the transmission bell housing. This filter housing is also part of the engine oil cooler assembly. There is no repair for this other then replacing the assembly. The lower intake manifold has to come off to get at it. Parts and labour adds up to about a Grand. Sorry for the hijack; but just a heads up, for you Mopar guys. Dan."
1070916,greyhawk,2021-03-03 16:34:00,33,The new Pentastar v6 is rated at 6730 lb towing capacity. You should not experience any probs with this vehicle.
1070922,410001661,2021-03-03 18:36:00,127,"I'm towing my 16'8"" Renegade with my Ram 1500 V6 and it does a great job - I hardly know it is behind the truck.  Plenty of HP and torque to do the job without ease - plus it is nice to store the cover and gear in the back of the truck while out fishing.  Before that I was using my wife's MDX and that was a dream to pull the boat but a lot more $$."
1070938,porkpie,2021-03-03 22:29:00,2521,"The reason I'm asking for real world examples is because rated towing capacity from the manufacturer seldom lives up to expectations.  And while weight wise my boat is no issue, that sucker has high sides and a big profile so it's a real kite.  Anyway, thanks all for the input.  By the sounds of it shouldn't be an issue."
1070941,misfish,2021-03-03 23:31:00,29133," Awesome,I will prepare a spot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1070943,porkpie,2021-03-04 00:54:00,2521,LOL alright pal deal!!
1070947,hirk,2021-03-04 02:20:00,571,"Make sure you get the 3.55 gears makes a big difference. I tow 3,500 easily."
1071126,pike slayer,2021-03-11 12:08:00,1177,I had a 2012 Jeep Wrangler with the 3.6 and I wasn’t that impressed with the motor. Had some electrical issues with it. Might have been a jeep  thing! I have had my 2017 ram with the 5.7 for the last 3 years and I love it. I’ve towed my 26’ camper trailer with zero issues and what you tow would be nothing for it. And I’m impressed at the fuel mileage I get with a full size with a v8.
1071128,AKRISONER,2021-03-11 12:33:00,5558,"Probably the only saving grace with my Eco diesel is that I have to be honest, towing my 18 foot glass skeeter with a 130 full of gear and 100 litres in jerry cans of gas etc etc im literally still getting 12mpg and depending on the drive that can dip into the 11's... Highway driving im consistently in the 9's and city its higher 10's. Ive towed a 26 foot glass cabin cruiser with it and it really didnt have any problem with it. It was heavy, and my mileage suffered but it handled it without issue. That weighs about 7000lbs so your boat will be quite all right. Now...for the bad, its a friggin dodge and what does that mean? Well it means that my windows are always de-railed (one nearly fell out on the highway recently) no matter how many times they have been fixed, I randomly have problems with the electronic shift control...that seemingly vanish. The entire EGR cooler system in my truck has been broken since I bought the truck in the summer of 2016. You can read my other posts about this but basically if I knew a lawyer id be suing FCA because after taking my truck to them literally 5 different times complaining about the exhaust dumping into the cab when I had my heat on and my truck eating coolant since new which progressively got worse and worse over time, I fell out of warranty and took it to a proper diesel mechanic who immediately told me my EGR cooler was cracked (and obviously has been since brand new) the diesel Dr's were the ones that ended up telling me that my EGR cooling system was actually under recall. Add this onto my turbo couplers blowing off multiple times randomly etc etc I forget the rest...long story short Dodge, you fooled me once, shame on you...youll never fool me again."
1071134,mamona,2021-03-11 15:18:00,597,"Geez, and me was looking at RAMs recently."
1071140,misfish,2021-03-11 17:34:00,29133,"Go like me. I do not care for fancy crap. My truck is basic. Roll up windows,manual locks and no fancy crap. Not even a CD player . KISS."
1071141,BillM,2021-03-11 17:38:00,17367,"You need to fully delete those Ecodiesels.    I think the lowest mileage I'll see in my Duramax is when I'm towing the 5th wheel + boat (About 12mpg US)   Problem is the most I'll see is maybe 17 unloaded, lol!    It is what it is."
1071147,AKRISONER,2021-03-11 18:01:00,5558,Pain in the butt that the companies doing those flashes are being threatened with law suits now. I’m looking at the new odb2 flashes now available to get mine finally done. It’s long overdue.
1071148,BillM,2021-03-11 18:10:00,17367,"The companies making the flashers are the ones under fire right now, although you can bench flash these ECUs.   Lots of guys out there that can rip everything off these engines and retune them."
