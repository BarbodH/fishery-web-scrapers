1071637,Dara,2021-03-31 03:27:00,3052,Sounds like a good plan And if you didn't get quite enough letting a bit of air out of the tires would help I guess. I have been wanting to do a bit of paint on my trailer and this would work. Thanks

1071643,cisco,2021-03-31 08:53:00,597,Your welcome. Many ways to tweek if needed. Done several very big fiberglass cruisers this way. Eg. is to trailer jack up the front after supporting the stern as described and then support the front under the trailer with blocks Now lower the jack so trailer jacks wheel is off the ground the height you want to increase and put some wood on the ground under the jacks wheel so jack can then be used again to lift your rig higher as needed.

1071355,Crimsongulf,2021-03-18 23:57:00,294,I am getting this over in Crawfordville FL this weekend to be the Napanee boat.  I have always liked a stick steer.  
1071364,ckewley,2021-03-19 09:07:00,699,"Last year was a total bust for me nothing saw the water but this year will be different!  This little rig has seen quite a bit of water just not in the last few years, extremely stable in the water. With the 2.5 she moves pretty good as well  However, ever since I got my Canoe the other boat sees mostly a storage rack. I will be moving this spring/summer to a place with lots of water around so getting both boats out will not be a problem, really looking forward to it!!!!"

1071537,boombap,2021-03-27 16:22:00,310,Nice boats guys Figured I’d ask this here before making a new topic. Ive recently discovered a good amount of water getting into my old deep v aluminum. It’s a riveted/welded hull. I put some water in it last week and the only spot I could find that was leaking was where it was missing a rivet. I replaced it with blind pop rivets and 5200. My issue now is that there’s a line of rivets where the boat sits on the bunks. When I had water in it the bunks were bone dry so I’m assuming they’re not leaking. Is there an easy way to lift the boat off the bunks to have a look?
1071538,Crimsongulf,2021-03-27 16:42:00,294,Do you have a picture of it sitting on the trailer?  I have used a floor jack and blocks to get it up then put jack stands under the boat.  I have also gone shade tree and used come alongs on a big tree limb to lift one off the trailer.
1071539,boombap,2021-03-27 16:52:00,310,Here’s a couple.. I thought about using a come-a-long and a strap and tying it off to the beam in the garage but ehhh that kinda worries me.  
1071542,Crimsongulf,2021-03-27 17:14:00,294,I would go with the come along.  The joists look strong and the boat doesn't appear to be heavy..  I did that in my basement garage using 1/2 inch poly.  I sealed some leaks on the old 14 tinner at the cottage with Gluvit.
1071546,boombap,2021-03-27 17:39:00,310,Maybe I’ll give it a shot In theory.. if the boat sat with water in it for 45 mins and the bunks were dry then the rivets are probably fine.. yeah?
1071548,Crimsongulf,2021-03-27 17:49:00,294,I would think so unless  there is a small leak that the bunks pressing up stopped..  I used the gluvit because it was leaking where the transom and hull join on the starboard side.  I didn't want to do a teardown so I tilted it up a bit and let the gluvit run down into the seam.  It has been three or four years and is still dry. 
1071549,boombap,2021-03-27 19:07:00,310,Gluvit is great stuff.. used it on a old build years ago. 5200 is also great.
1071550,Crimsongulf,2021-03-27 19:22:00,294,Just make sure whatever you put 5200 on you never want to ever move it again.  Don't ask me how I know that.
1071552,BillM,2021-03-27 19:44:00,17367,"If you want to remove it later, 3M 4200 will work just fine."
1071553,cisco,2021-03-27 20:29:00,597,"Easy. Boat guys all do this to work on their hull. Just use the trailer jack to lower the front as much as possible. Now pile supports like cement blocks with wood under each back corner as close to the hull as possible. Now just jack up the front and the rear now rests on the supports and you can easily put supports like blocks with wood to cushion, under the front sides but IMHO best to use a long beam like a 4 X 4. Can do it so the trailer can be driven out from underneath to allow almost complete access to do your work. But of course ensure you use sturdy supports and cushion things so the hull doesn't get scratched on, say, cement blocks."

That called for a full vacuum and wash of the entire boat. Then the boat launches were closed, which meant even more cleaning and waxing to pass the time.

The only thing that isn't great in my mind is that the transoms are low in some models. Water splashes into the water wells more than others. So much so that one guy I know installed a 2nd bilge pump under the water well just for that. Other than that great boats. That 91' 680T Ranger of Tomcats is a beauty.

Up to a few years ago I helped reconfigure 3 early 19' 1990's era full wind screen StarCrafts into centre council ( center for you). Perfect for out here. The same 115 HP Mercs with the same hull and removing the front and rear casting platforms and the full windshields are getting 20 or more MPH at WOT. It's like going from fishing out of a phone booth* to being the only couple on the dance floor. The only downfall is for the other guys not ducking behind the small windshield going into the wind back to the north shore. 9.99 times the wind is out of the NW heading into shore on Erie. A local Marine dealer has brought in center council Key West glass boats a few years ago. I don't know how sales are. They sure ain't priced like Trackers. *For you yungins' here a phone booth had a telephone mounted on the wall, something called a ""phone book"" was hanging from a chain and that was basically an analogue manual 411 Google. The phone only worked if you put money in it. Things really got modern when you could use a ""Bell phone card."" Then you didn't need cash to operate it. I think they have one at The Smithsonian in Washington D.C. It is next to a 1st generation lap top that went for more than $3000.00 CDN. And that was when CDN was at par or more than USD."

Erie is probably worse because the rollers launch you when you crest them. Regardless, bassboats aren't for everyone. They have a unique purpose and for those that want it, nothing fishes better. Trolling isn't one of them. Multi-species boats do a lot of things well but give up performance in some areas to accomplish this. No biggie, pick your poison and spend your money where you see fit."

1058397,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-30 20:16:00,8243,Thanks Bud. We took a core sample from the floor and the isostyrene foam was dry. I know we are going to tear it all out and find the leak in the future. We would probably turn her into a centre council if we tear it all out. We did that with 2 other identical Star Crafts of the same vintage a few years back. Amazing how much more room without the wind shield and rear casting platform. A lot of work for sure but it beats dropping 50 grand or more on a new 19'er. Plus the same boats get another 15 to 20  MPH with less weight at WOT. Maybe like this one.

1058425,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-31 01:51:00,8243,David are you looking for a similar style boat when you pull the trigger? The reason I ask is earlier in the month I was in Proctor Marine's showroom and they had a Crestliner 195 on sale for the high 40's regular price was around 65K if I can recall correctly. 200 HP Merc. It must be a new 2019. A great deal for anyone looking for a new boat this year at last years prices. I think Dany Columbi took me out on his 20' Skeeter on a Musky charter out of Sturgeon Falls 5 years ago. It was more Walleye boat than a Bass boat. I think he has more electronics on it than NASA's Apollo missions had in the 60's. No I don't think I know. http://www.proctormarine.com/showroom/2019-crestliner-1850-super-hawk-simcoe-on-n3y4r5/

Bass boats are specific, personally I wouldn't ever buy one. I can fish Bass in my 19' deep V StarCraft that has only about a 12"" draught but I can't go out and troll for Pics in a Bass boat unless the water is dead calm. I went out in a co workers Bass boat for perch here on Erie. When the wind picked up I got a nice shower heading into port.

It didn't get the bottom wet for 2 years and wanted to make sure she was 110% ready to go. The main thing was to pump out all that old gas in the main tank and dump the 5 gallons in the kicker tank. I won't put 2 year old gas in any 2 stroke tool I have. Glad I did take her in as they found a few small things that could be huge on the water, like a bad bilge pump and the power pack was pooched on the kicker as well the power cable to the GPS combo had to be changed. My marine Guru Ted is using a walker now so I had to pay bigger. I've saved thousands over the years helping Ted work on my boat and learned plenty. Such is life.  Our trip to Georgina for Perch next month cancelled. No motels available and I'm not sure I would stay in a 5 star Marriot in this thing we are all trudging through today. The up part is traffic on the highways are nil. We might just commute or go to Burwell or Bruce."

I never lost the desire, just the means to accomplish what I wanted to do. I made due to some extent with renting a boat on occasion, but you don't get things like trolling motors and electronics that you become accustomed to. In 2017, I purchased a new boat package.....and then promptly had a speeding dump truck try to eradicate me from this earth!! The last couple of years are seeing more and more outings, but I got to admit....if we ever get out of this isolation or ""social distancing"" crap, I am chomping at the bit to get back at it!! Here's to getting all of hose purty boats in the posts above, wet as often as possible this season!!"
1057714,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-22 03:16:00,8243,"I hear you. I was a hand shake away from selling the StarCraft Superfisherman 190. I am so glad I didn't. For what I would have sold it for I would be several 1000's of bucks short to get into a 14 or 15' side council. When I was at my Marine guys showroom a few weeks ago they had a 19'6"" Crestliner on sale for $49,000.00, 15K off. Much deeper and wider with a 200 HP 4 stroke and a dual axle tandem trailer. Not this year, maybe next year who knows. Our  boat isn't perfectas  it occasionally leaks. After some outings water drains from the bilge, some days dry as a bone. She's a 94', 26 years old, well beyond it's best before date for any aluminum pleasure craft boat, the experts say a tin boat's life expectancy is 15 years . I could spend a few bucks on replacing the old carpeting and a new VHF, might as well upgrading the GPS and sonar while I'm at it, a screen can't be too big for me. The 26 year old 24V front electric troller is kaput. I sure don't Bass fish much anymore but that's the 1st thing I would upgrade. It's not the end of the World if I don't have a new $1500.00 whatever unit. In the blink of the eye I just spent nearly 4K and I'm doing all the work. Where can you be safer than out in the middle of the lake with a 1st mate 6 feet away from you. Unless it's the partner you sleep with. 6' away would be a separate bed. If this becomes an epidemic I'm going fishing. I'll launch at a pals Marina only 17 minutes from us if all others are closed. Yes lets get all dem purdy boats wet. ASAP. Johnny D/Selkirk ON. "

We are making a game plan going forward to deal with the leak(s) are. I say we because I have gifted 50% ownership to a friend I have known since the very 1st day of high school. He thinks he owes me 5K. You were here when we were doing a remodel of the cottage. He wouldn't take a penny and did most of the work with his guys that I know he paid. Imagine I know the man for 52 years and still can't get rid of him. He might as well own the boat because 99% of the time he is with me on her fishing anyway, he might as well chip in a bit now. I filled her up yesterday from MT as well as 5@20 liters of high octane fuel for 91.9 cents a liter normally $1.30 or higher around here and even more at the marina's.

The """"Boat Whisperer"""" Ted's health has gone for a bad turn this past winter and he sold his shop where we did all the work. He is doing better but not up to helping me or anywhere to do it nice and warm and dry. Dry as in not getting wet. As they say use it or lose it. From draining old fuel and looking into a bilge pump problem those 2 little jobs turned into a $975.00 bill I paid on Monday. But look at all the money I didn't spend in the last 2 years. It is what it is. Now I can take Ted out for a few Erie Walleye this summer. He is also """" The Pic Whisperer"""" Can't wait to hit some Perch 1st at Georgina ASAP."

The current 'big water' boat is a pimped out Princecraft Yukon. It's been half way across both Erie and Huron a few times 😄 and what a sweet little boat for smaller waters. I may keep it tho plans are to pick up a cheaper tow vehicle and maybe my dream boat, a Kingfisher Warrior 1825 in, the next few years         "

1055881,AKRISONER,2020-01-31 19:19:00,5558,"shes not nearly as quick as devil's Lund strapped with that big ass merc, but for an 18 foot boat shes fast enough to scare me lol. Chine walk when you dont have any more juice to push through it is about as scary as it gets when boating ahahaha, This boat gets on pad nicely and scoots pretty damn well when shes up on plane. ive got it to 56mph on the GPS but that was on the right day, the right load and me riding solo. When its tournament day with a partner and a boat full of gear she does between 49 and 52 dependent on conditions. Its a bass boat though so if im driving under 37 it rides like a snowplow. I drive it 40 any time im not tournament fishing, otherwise I cant afford the gas bill. She eats premium when shes opened up. Gotta love a big carbureted two stroke lol Skeeter makes a good hull, and considering I dont have a jack plate or a trim tab (this annoys me a lot, especially with how important trim is in a bass boat) ive spent enough time driving her now that I can get her going pretty good. I drive the boat by ear, I can tell where the sweet spot in the trim is by listening and feel and watching the GPS. The boat is scary at full throttle, It took me a while to get comfortable driving it that fast, when i first got it I couldnt do it.  Im not a total maniac but ive spent my entire life driving stuff, snowmobiles, quads, boats etc. so I drive with a bit of an edge. Enough to scare my friends too sometimes but within reason. If you can believe it, 130 is underpowered shes rated for a 150! heres me scaring my buddies down on Santee Cooper catching some air lol "
1055882,Musky Plug,2020-01-31 20:37:00,398,Yes I would be in 100%. We will have set something up for-sure!

I've managed to somewhat scrape some time together, but its never been good, I was only able to access one of my more preferred fishing spots for the first time this past weekend only to have the weather completely throw a stick in my spokes.

1055643,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-25 22:38:00,8243,"A Lund was always what I wanted. I only shopped for a fishing rig since 1980. I finally did get my Lund. A 17' Adventurer I think it was with a 90 Yamaha used from a dealer in Simcoe. They offered a 90 day warranty on the O/B. I had them write in a hull warranty for 14 days, long story. The very 1st time we took it out the day after I got it home for it's maiden voyage it took on water, a lot of water. Lucky we didn't sink it as I had 2  former offensive linemen with me, about 900 lbs of humanity. The hull was cracked from stem to stern. I was devastated. The dealer couldn't believe it as it was a long time customer that traded it in. His kid was the last one out in it. ?????? They honored the warranty. One of the sales guys there decided to sell me his own StarCraft 12 years ago and I couldn't have more happy. That saying about 2 days being the happiest for a boat guy the day buying and selling is bunk to me. Going from 17' to 19' doesn't sound like much but it is. Much wider and deeper. You have a nice rig there Pigeontroller. The Lund deep V's and the StarCrafts look very similar. Someone told me they shared the same hulls in certain models back in the 90's."
1055644,lew,2020-01-25 22:48:00,12766,Loved my SKEETER and had it for 10 years without an issue on boat or motor.  It was a great musky fishing boat and we saw plenty of action together.   But when I decided to retire from fishing I sold all my gear including the boat and this was the last day I had her and the new owner picked her up just after this picture was taken. Kind of a sad day really.
