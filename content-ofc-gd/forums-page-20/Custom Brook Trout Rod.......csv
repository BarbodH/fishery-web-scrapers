1071809,Spiel,2021-04-05 18:24:00,9065,"A while back I was asked by a friend to build a custom Brook Trout rod for his annual fly in trips. ""No biggie"" I said. 	Then he asked if I could make the reel seat look like a Brook Trout, well that was going to take me into new territory. 	I accepted the challenge and when his name came up in my build book I set to work. I was more than comfortable with all aspects of this build with the exception of the ""Brook Trout"" themed reel seat. Ideas cooked for a bit in my mind, then I came up with a design but I needed someone willing to take on the painting of the components I had envisioned. I reached out to my very talented friend Brandon Trafananko up on the Bruce Peninsula. He jumped at the chance to be part of this project.  	So in short, here are some pictures of the project from start to finish.           "

1071836,Spiel,2021-04-06 12:57:00,9065,The material Brian is white acrylic turned to shape on my metal and to mortise it for the reel I have a bull nose router bit in a metal lathe/mill combo and a vertical riser to hold in place on the cross slide.
