1071736,GBW,2021-04-02 20:52:00,8460,My folks lake (4ml) is half clear now.  Anything South of it looks to be open.  Tight lines all!!!
1071741,porkpie,2021-04-02 22:16:00,2521,I've been in the boat 3 times already.  Sadly less time to fish than I'd like at the moment.
1071800,BillM,2021-04-05 12:20:00,17367,"Boat has been wet a bunch this year.   Lake O, Georgian Bay, etc.   Love the spring!"
1071802,AKRISONER,2021-04-05 13:08:00,5558,I’ve been out for bass already !
1071803,LostAnotherOne,2021-04-05 13:44:00,956,This last Saturday.  Wife doesn’t play around when it comes to masks lol   
1071814,Moosebunk,2021-04-05 21:56:00,3970,Spring if home I'd be all over those lakes open already north of Lady O.  And probably on the big pond after lakers too. Can't wait for May.
