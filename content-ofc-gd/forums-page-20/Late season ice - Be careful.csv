1071472,AKRISONER,2021-03-24 13:01:00,5558,"I’m not surprised what so ever by someone doing this, what I’m most surprised about is that someone that bloody moronic and stupid has a good job that pays them enough to buy a new f150 the idea of driving on any lake south of Sudbury scares the hell out of me...the idea of driving on simcoe!!!! Last week!!! When most guys had called it a season the week before even for walking is absolutely mind blowing. heck we didn’t even take the sleds on the ice in parry sound this weekend"
1071473,Fisherman,2021-03-24 13:07:00,7201,Ya just can't fix stupid no matter how much duck tape or WD40 you use.

1071483,craigdritchie,2021-03-24 22:56:00,1586,"Here's a Boeing 737 landing on a frozen lake in NWT. It's actually pretty common, it's how they get heavy equipment that's too big for a float plane into those remote northern fly-in camps. Just wait for the lake to freeze, then load up a 737 and give 'er. That said, it's landing on five or six feet of solid ice. I don't think I would try this on Simcoe right now either. https://youtu.be/5FQp1siO41s  also: https://worldairlinenews.com/2018/04/16/nolinor-aviation-boeing-737-lands-on-a-frozen-lake/"
1071485,grimsbylander,2021-03-25 03:03:00,3016,All I can picture is me sitting on a lake jigging and thinking how convenient that someone plowed a nice big path. Hey what’s that noise????
1071507,Dara,2021-03-25 22:59:00,3052,That begs a couple questions  First   do the run studded snow tires  second  I guess they don't have the speed limit like on ice road truckers
1071512,Ronzo,2021-03-26 13:40:00,124,Head in sand -> truck in water.  I'd like to hear the story behind this one.
