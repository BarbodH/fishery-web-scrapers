1071900,captpierre,2021-04-09 01:12:00,2521,I hope the spring spawn for walleye is good.   Saw a couple guys fishing the bottom of Burleigh Falls today just up from Stoney. Signs all over about Fish Sanctuary.  😐
1071901,AKRISONER,2021-04-09 01:47:00,5558,Hope you called the mnr tips line with their license plate numbers
1071907,porkpie,2021-04-09 12:27:00,2521,Dollars to donuts they’ll have status cards if their obvious about it.  Same thing happens at Buckhorn every year.
1071910,captpierre,2021-04-09 13:08:00,2521,That’s what I suspected.
1071915,mamona,2021-04-09 14:06:00,597,"Forgive me asking, what are status cards?"
1071919,AKRISONER,2021-04-09 14:28:00,5558,indegenous ID Which usually allows you to fish within your treaty grounds. Being Metis status doesnt mean you get to do whatever the hell you want.
1071925,mamona,2021-04-09 15:02:00,597,Thank you for the clarification. In Alberta no one was even reacting when something like that was happening. Only me 
1071927,OhioFisherman,2021-04-09 16:32:00,6623,"The Walleye spawn here on Lake Erie has been going on for a few weeks now, the Perch seem to need help? https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/about-odnr/news/yellow-perch-daily-limit-reduced?fbclid=IwAR12VZUwbffAdfxQHst_F7GgWrThkxmDCQGyJ7kXYg4fFRUVg3B5_SyBAUo"
1071928,captpierre,2021-04-09 16:38:00,2521,What is Mites status?  I was under the impression that they have the right to fish and hunt whenever/wherever they want as long as it’s for their own use 
1071930,Fisherman,2021-04-09 16:50:00,7201,"Metis,  when non indigenous got hitched up with natives and made Metis."
1071961,BillM,2021-04-10 20:30:00,17367,"Nope, it's gotta be in their territory or treaty.    Everywhere else the normal FMZ rules need to be followed."
1071970,AKRISONER,2021-04-11 12:57:00,5558,My bad with the autocorrect lol what Bill said
