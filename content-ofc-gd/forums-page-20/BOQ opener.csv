1072818,206,2021-04-29 12:31:00,563,Who's going? I gotta work this weekend but just curious what is going to happen down there. I have heard launches are still open at this point but will police be stopping people? What has the world come too that you are afraid to go fishing 
1072820,mitch seguin,2021-04-29 12:46:00,98,Please no more more covid opinions.  The thread just goes sideways from there.

1072857,pics,2021-04-30 03:44:00,1268,Bayfront ramp is open here in Hamilton and the police marine unit is actively stopping and harassing boaters. They have to leave or be ticketed
1072859,Terry,2021-04-30 10:35:00,14456,For what charge
1072866,irishfield,2021-04-30 14:50:00,26272,Gathering with other than household members. 4 or 5 guys in a boat..
1072867,Terry,2021-04-30 16:10:00,14456,Well yeah if they are stupid enough not to follow the rules they deserve the ticket so no charge for traveling no charge for boating or fishing I can live with that
1072868,pics,2021-04-30 17:49:00,1268,The ramp is open to essential launching only.. whatever that is. BOQ should be ok for fishing as long as the ramps are open because I doubt they have a marine unit patrol..
1072870,irishfield,2021-04-30 18:13:00,26272,"LOL, BOQ detachment dock is right beside the Ferry..."
1072871,Garnet,2021-04-30 19:34:00,2056,My story will be I'm harvesting food.
1072872,Headhunter,2021-04-30 19:38:00,5703,Assuming they have the money for fuel and wages! HH
1072874,jonasdry,2021-04-30 20:26:00,63,We have charter rights for both mobility and assembly in Canada. Our charter rights are not at the discretion of any level of gov't and means that we cannot be prosecuted by the gov't for exersizing these rights. I will be fishing soon enough and have no fear of these fines they are handing out because the orders are a blatant violation of our charter rights.
1072875,Mr Greedydrift,2021-04-30 22:06:00,25,It seems the OPP are the only ones enforcing anything so I will launch where they arent around. I know that a ticket from them could be fought in court but I dont need that hassle. Regional police are not chasing boaters. Not that Ive heard of anyway.
1072888,Sinker,2021-05-01 13:24:00,8692,"Go fishing if you want. I've been out several times, no issues whatsoever. I had an OPP follow me most of the way to the lake the last time I went, and no issues. Drove past many PTBO police towing my boat too.  You are all falling into the trap if your not going. Your not spreading anything, or catching anything if you are alone, or with a member of your household. Just go. I'm sick of all the Bull rules. There is nothing illegal about it at all. Launches are open, unless your township are jerks. Just go!  See you on the water! S."
1072913,kickingfrog,2021-05-02 19:18:00,8333,My buddy has a boat house not too far from Picton. He's not sure if he'll be putting his boat in this year as the water is down a least 3 feet. My boat would fit but I need a ladder to get up about 5 feet to the landing.
1072915,woodenboater,2021-05-02 21:20:00,2277,was in PEC last week and saw a sweet Lund (guessing 18' or longer) at a gas station on 33.
1072934,Dara,2021-05-03 20:42:00,3052,An old friend went fishing in BOQ this weekend but way up here out of the hot zones our launch is barricaded
1072937,AKRISONER,2021-05-04 02:28:00,5558,"Drove north and went fishing this weekend. Was towing the boat, had the OPP cruising with me on the 400, no issues. Was a great weekend caught a bunch "
1072945,Musky Plug,2021-05-04 13:09:00,398,Which launch did you use? Was thinking about this weekend!
1072949,AKRISONER,2021-05-04 13:37:00,5558,"weve got a private launch at our new place. If you are headed to PAB, head to The Moorings at the end of north shore road. Id imagine Brian will let you launch at his place. I think its $15? in and out."
