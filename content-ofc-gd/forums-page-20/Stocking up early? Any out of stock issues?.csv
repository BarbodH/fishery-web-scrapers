This winter all stores booked much bigger¬†orders to restock and prepare for another busy season. Add to the fact that there were n still are supply chain issues and shipping delays and you get the current situation.

I am in the process of outfitting a new boat and have been buying up rods/reels, fishing tackle and boat accessories all winter because I had zero confidence that these items will be available come spring.¬† Some items I needed to order out of the US or on Amazon because I could not find it in Canada.¬† My first stop was Fishing World and/or Grimsby Tackle, then amazon, then I'm looking on-line (Canada or USA).¬† Not one item purchased from BPS or Cabelas. - O'Brian Water Skis, Minnkota iPilot kit for trolling motor, 2 trolling rods and counter reels, planer boards, Navionics + card,¬†snap weights, over $200 in lures and tackle, boat storage cover, rod holders (x4), new life jackets (x3), & a bow mounted fish finder."

Canadian Tire actually had a certain soft bait I couldn't find anywhere else. I picked up all sorts of flipping and EWG hooks, lines, and baits.

I was lucky enough to find a brand new 2019 Lund that a dealer still had in stock.¬† Since then I've bought many of the things you listed because I had no confidence I'd be able to find them come spring.
