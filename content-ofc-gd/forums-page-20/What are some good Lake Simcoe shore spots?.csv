1072061,Terry,2021-04-15 15:47:00,14456,The only place I get walleye From shore on simcoe is near Beaverton and as for the others the good spots I have are good because not too many people know them. So sorry but I can not share
1072065,Headhunter,2021-04-15 18:28:00,5703,"Don't believe Terry, he's actually not sorry. HH"
1072068,misfish,2021-04-15 20:11:00,29133,"They must be really secret Joe. Even I don't know them,or maybe I do and have not caught anything at them ."
1072069,misfish,2021-04-15 20:16:00,29133,"Your question is pretty loaded friend . Asking for spots on ANY open forum is pretty much taboo.  As for shore spot on Simcoe, you will be pressed to find any that you will need to be a resident of the area . It is getting worse by the year . Good luck to you and your search."

1072085,Rizzo,2021-04-16 00:43:00,4754,Dave if you released those fish they will be HUGE by now. Great tip!
1072250,AKRISONER,2021-04-19 13:39:00,5558,"funny how this guy hasnt posted again or seemingly even been back? My suggestion is if you are going to fish simcoe from shore, make sure you cast towards the water."
