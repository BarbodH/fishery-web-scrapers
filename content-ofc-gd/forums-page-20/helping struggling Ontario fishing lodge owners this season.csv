1071751,T-Bone,2021-04-03 02:54:00,160,That’s great... but why wouldn’t they have been doing that since like 2010? It’s free. Businesses that weather adversity thrive...the others...well... Like all business...gotta be smart and ready for almost anything...even this crappy hand we’ve been dealt. The good ones will make it...the others weren’t meant to... It’s been put to song many times because it’s so true...only the strong survive.
1071752,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-03 12:30:00,720,"So true. I think we’ve all seen businesses wither away because they didn’t stick with the times or adapt to changes. Granted, Covid 19 caught so many off guard, so to prepare for that was probably not possible (speaking of the first year). but we’re in this now year two and probably going to be lingering effects for the next few so immediate action on counter strategy is vital for those who’s clientele have been greatly reduced and will likely to be over the next few years.  	 I.e. marketing strategies, package options, value added services, etc. Thinking outside the box instead of trying to plug away as usual may not only help survive the times but also build the business into a much stronger, profitable one post-covid. I wish all business owners luck. So many have folded already. "
1071755,Adam Wood,2021-04-03 13:57:00,3,"I agree completely social media is imperative these days we spend hundreds of dollars advertising each month only in Ontario.  The challenge in times like this is getting people to book.  People are afraid to make a booking. Lockdown after lockdown and stories of lost deposits and delayed reservations makes it tough, We completely get it. We made a decision to offer residents a full refund if your trip get cancelled due to a covid lockdown or restriction that prevents your trip from going forward.  Hoping that if people have nothing to loose then they will feel more comfortable making a booking. Even then people are afraid.  I had a Coorporate trip where the business was picking up the tab, and they could not find enough people willing to travel for free!! Times are tough and unprecedented for sure.   Hang in there folks we will get through this.  Adam"
1071773,scuro2,2021-04-04 10:33:00,904,"I dunno. I think that sentiment is a little tone deaf. No one saw this coming. You can social media till your eyes bleed in this 2nd year but if the bulk of Canadian fishermen live in the GTA, how many Canadians are going to drive anywhere near the distance to Thunder Bay and your establishment? As a lodge owner you may have made a big investment in 2019 and I bet there are a lot of operations where they are now fully dependent on the wife's income to keep their establishment afloat. In this situation bull-crap to, ""only the strong survive"". There is a lot of chance and luck playing into this also. If your place is on the French River you're golden, you will be fully booked and it's the best of times. If on the other hand you're on Lac Seul and you had a STRONG business with 95% American customers, you could be on your knees.  	This is exactly why I'm doing it different this year and making the trek out that way. Go fish in a different pond, it's an adjustment that if enough of us made it, then it could make a difference. Like a mini Ontarian fishing Dunkirk. You get a banner fishing year in prime fishing weeks with some lodges more then 1/2 empty. To boot some places are offering discounted rates. Win-win."
1071262,scuro2,2021-03-15 15:10:00,904,I've been looking for a place to go this year and have looked as far as Saskatchewan. Problem is when is a safe time to get on a plane? What some lodge owners did last year was to open their lodges up to Canadians and they may well start their season off like that again this year with the borders being closed. Who knows where it goes from there. Like last year those places closer to Toronto are fully booked or near capacity. This year there is a good chance my wife and I will have at least one jab at the start of the season. It may be the year to take that long road trip west. Having retired it could be a trip that lasts several weeks.   	Perhaps there are others like me willing to go to western Ontario for the 1st time to fish. If you own a lodge or know of a lodge that would be struggling this year I'd like to hear from you. We could be in the enviable position where you only have to commit to a few days but could stay as long as you like if you stubble upon a gem.
1071273,DanD,2021-03-16 13:16:00,2223,Have a look at Ontario Fishing Network. There are tons of links directing you to lodges all around Northern Ontario. You should be able to find what you're looking for? TJ (The Owner of OFC) is an admin here and the original owner of this message board. OFC  Dan.
1071281,scuro2,2021-03-16 15:24:00,904,"This is unlike any other year in the business. Last year most places stayed closed. This year it's a mixed bag. Some are closed, some are full steam ahead, and others are sitting on the fence. I imagine some lodges have gone out of business. I've contacted establishments that are not returning emails. It would be nice to help those establishments who are seeking business and probably need business. WIN-WIN. We are a community so I thought I'd give it a try. May be I'd get a lead or two but no worries if nothing comes of this, I have some spots in mind already. I'm just fishing for ideas to make a search a little easier!"

1071292,Whopper,2021-03-16 19:51:00,2174,"Sportsman's Lodge and Manitoba Trophy Outposts (trophypikecanada.com) Owned and operated by a Canadian. Brett Geary lives in Red Lake and owns this fish camp on Little Vermilion along with a couple outpost camps. This is a fly in that is economical, just a short ten minute float plane ride from base camp on the the Chukuni  River. Lots of small to medium size walleye and giant pike.  "
1071293,scuro2,2021-03-16 21:54:00,904,"Thanks for that! I've been to Wawa before, we stayed at Naturally Superior, and I really liked the area. They outfitted a lovely day canoe ride down the Michipicton river which I'd love her to do for the first time. I had always wondered about fishing in these parts. I'll show the Mrs and who knows!"
1071295,Old Ironmaker,2021-03-16 22:46:00,8243,"It is encouraging to know that outfitters/lodge owners are getting bookings. Many have gone under in the last year. It was tough getting bookings and many never recovered from the last Super Recesion let alone losing an entire year of revenue due to Covid. The hydro, gas, telephone, property tax bill among others not mentioned doesn't care if you don't have business, ""No money? Too bad pay me. You are sick and can't work a second or 3rd job, too bad, pay me. Wife lost her job? Too bad pay me. Kids moved back home, too bad pay me."" To answer your 1st question, it may never be safe to travel by air in the future. We just do not know enough about covid-19 as well as the vacines for C-19 to answer that question for certain. What about novel virus covid-21. (The number behind the word covid is the year the virus is identified.) The second thing is that the borders are closed to non commercial vehicular traffic or persons walking across a border crossing for the purpose of vacationing i.e. snowbirds driving across the border to vacation south. It gets cloudy when someone outside the US owns property within the US rents it out and can prove that.  Anyone can fly across the border, rent a car and be on their way for any reason including fishing in Saskatchewan. I have a close freind that has property in Florida and South Carolina he rents out. He made arrangements to ship his car to Florida, flew to Sarasota airport where his car was waiting for him and his wife and he will stay in the US for the next 6 months. Another couple had their car waiting for them on the NY side of the border, got in it and drove to a rental in Florida. Please do not take my word for it. The Canadian and US governments have a boat load of information stating what rules and regualtions are in place for crossing the US?Canada border. Regulations may vary for each country. DO NOT ASSUME anything, have paperwork, such as a tax roll for your US or Canadian property you may own in place and at your disposal to show US or Canada Customs. Not every Customs/Immigration official knows 100% of the regulations, it seems they change with regularity. "
1071299,scuro2,2021-03-17 00:28:00,904,"Oh I think many people will be flying sometime this late summer or fall. Once many are vaccinated and the rate of spread drops off a cliff there will be about as much danger flying as during a normal flu season. Those vaccinated don't have to worry as much about the worst outcomes. You will also see Covid much weaker during the summer as it was last year. Where we go late 2021-22 who knows. It could be more like normal, perhaps with booster shots at your pharmacy for those that want it. I think you will see mask wearing by a portion of the population for some time."
1071305,pics,2021-03-17 13:18:00,1268,The more southern Ontario resorts were fully booked but Northwestern ones were hit hard. Apparently most people think that it's too far to drive past Temagami..
1071306,pine portage,2021-03-17 13:56:00,12,"Yes you are correct, but really Toronto area to Wawa is about 10 hour drive, but there are alternate highway options like  hwy 144 that does cut off about 2 hours."
1071312,pics,2021-03-17 18:57:00,1268,People really don't know what they're missing.. I travel to the Nipigon region myself...
1071314,Pochucker,2021-03-17 19:23:00,16,Im still having trouble wrapping my head around possibility that even though i'm fully vaccinated (which I am) I might not be allowed to drive to NW ontario this summer to fish in middle of nowhere. I get it if your not vaccinated stay out.
1071321,Old Ironmaker,2021-03-17 21:29:00,8243,"During normal years this would be considered advertising on the site and discouraged. With what our business people such as yourself are going through now, advertise away. Nice looking place you have there. I've never stayed at a lodge but if I ever was I picture a place like yours. Luxury for us was a picnic table and indoor plumbing. One cabin on the Ottawa we rented for years starting mid 80's for years and we actually eventually purchased on crown land for 5 grand was $100.00 a week including a 12' tinny, no motor though. Good luck."

1071326,aplumma,2021-03-17 23:13:00,6896,No offence taken we do have very good advertising rates and would welcome you to discuss them with TJQ  He has a few avenues that I am sure could help you increase your business  as well as support this site. Good luck and hopefully we can get back to a more normal world this year and fish. Art

Thanks and contact Tj this group is a good one."
1071338,scuro2,2021-03-18 02:26:00,904,I am curious about owners and their specific situation. How was last year compared to this year and how is this year shaping up? You are up Cochrane way so would have less American clients?
1071339,Adam Wood,2021-03-18 02:53:00,3,So we are quite a best west of Cochrane. We fly in out of Nakina.  Last season (our first as new owners) we did not open until the end of August. We had 2 weeks of fishing and then our hunting season.  This season we are open for business and taking bookings. With the border closed and many others reluctant to spend money in uncertain times our bookings are not where we would like them.  We are offering a money back guarantee for this spring for our resident guests to assist in people feeling more comfortable booking. Our fishing is usually a good mix of residents and non residents.    	We are here for the long term and will make the best of a poor situation.  Again we wish the best to everyone this season. Adam

1071345,scuro2,2021-03-18 14:36:00,904,Love hearing from the owners. Keep those post coming. I look at each one. From considering a possible trip we are now going for sure and will book when we get our vaccination appointments. I'd like to get to at least Thunder bay and can see us staying at a 1/2 dozen places.

1071743,Hack_Fisherman,2021-04-03 00:22:00,720,I think it would be a good strategy for those who normally cater to Americans to start using social media and other means to shift their focus on securing Canadian guests. We stayed on the French twice last year. The lodge owner had some decent interest by using social media and word of mouth. I don’t know if they were booked solid but I believe they were quite steady.
