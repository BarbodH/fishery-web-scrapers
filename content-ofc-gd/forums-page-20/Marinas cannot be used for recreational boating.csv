It is easy to say what we should do when we have no education in the matter (how many epidemiologists are members of this board?) and no data to drive good decision making.  There are too many YouTube experts here.  We have Public Health departments for a reason.

It worked, they created a bubble.  	Otherwise look at my case, you can't even trust your own family to do the right thing because the young  don't take CV19 as seriously. In my daughter's case she avoids news and learns of things if it is trending on one of her platforms. To the young we are out of date relics and in some ways we are. The flip side to that coin is naivety."

1072563,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-24 01:02:00,602,They closed the innisfil beach rd park launch. Thankfully I belong to a private beach around here with a launch.

1072569,scuro2,2021-04-24 10:17:00,904,"But is it really wow?  	In both the US and Canada cases and deaths spiked after Thanksgiving. Who was dying? In a nutshell Grandma and Grandpa. Generally speaking they are not the ones flying to get to Thanksgiving. So people came to thanksgiving already infected. You can't get infected and spread CV19 within 3 days so you couldn't catch it while travelling and then spread it once there. I'm sure there were many discussions within families ahead of time to be safe, to isolate. In Canada many younger ones could isolate because they were on CERB. My daughter's definition of isolation included being with her one friend who was also ""isolating"". Think of the skeptics on this board, how many of them would even know all the guidelines for isolation? If CV19 is ""just another flu"" most likely you're not going to take this as seriously and pour over federal guidelines as someone who is worried about dying from this, like grandparents."
1072570,GregF2,2021-04-24 10:39:00,46,"Canada’s leaders are so clueless.  Lockdowns do not work.  This is the fourth one and every time Covid just comes back.  Live with it.  Look at TX and FL, wide open, no masks and doing as fine or better than Canada and any other State.  Canada has become a lockdown and isolationist Country within it is borders and outside of them.  How crazy is it they outlaw golf, maybe fishing and other outdoor activities?  They have lost it. Canada’s leaders should be fired.  No planning to manufacture the vaccines and they use lockdowns as excuses.  Meanwhile, many business will fail and people are losing valuable time in their lives by not being allowed to do anything. But, hey people that like lockdowns, must love a Socialistic/Communist country as that what is happening.  Learn to live with Covid, it is not going away. I and my son have had Covid and it was like a bad flu.  Just fine now.  In the US over 70 percent of the population over 65 now has had the vaccine.  1/2 the Country has one shot.  What the heck have Canada leaders done.  Absolutely nothing!"
1072575,Rizzo,2021-04-24 12:09:00,4754,"I think this phrase is key. As someone who believes there is more to this life than what we see here and now, I am not afraid of dying. When we get older there are many things that could take our life that younger people would not fear. Covid is just one of them! So when that day comes for me,  I imagine I will want to spend as MUCH of my time left as possible with family and other loved ones! I often wonder if you ask Grandma and Grandpa ""Would you rather live another 2 years locked away, isolated from loved ones OR would you rather have 1 more year surrounded by the love of your family""...which would they choose? For me, it is a no brainer. I would take quality over quantity any day. I have heard of many people who have pulled family members out of nursing homes for that exact reason, and I applaud them for it (and my family has permission to do the same to me if a time like this happens again when I am older!)"

1072588,scuro2,2021-04-24 13:47:00,904,"It may be that sort of binary choice for some of the elderly, risk death or get hugs and kisses. Some can't live without touching, but it's not that way for most. The elderly often are well informed and do everything to not get infected. I do get it, try not to live in fear and live your life. But again that is not a binary notion. You can take precautions knowing that you're doing the best you can do and move forward.  	We have all learned that most need in person human contact. If something like this happens again and I'm much older I will seek low risk human contact. Take the smarter risks for human contact, meet outside or only see one or two people that you can fully trust. Being part of 20 plus person Christmas celebration in the middle of a pandemic at 80+ is idiotic if you desire to live. We mostly don't need lots of hugs and kisses necessarily but just to be around people and 6ft away seems to be good enough for most.  	This is why the Ford ban on all outdoor contact is Stuupid. Allow for low risk contact. Singles tennis or two person fishing 6ft apart if you come in separate cars should have been a given. The knowitalls will do whatever they want to do anyways. The vast majority of the population will follow smartly thought out rules."

1072631,Musky Plug,2021-04-25 21:24:00,398,"X2 wow is right.  At the end of the day people should have the freedom to choose how they want to live. Either in fear or the choice not to. If you want to stay home and live in fear that’s your choice but I along with probably many other refuse not to. I refuse to let someone else ruin my life and my livelihood, when I worked my f’n ass off to build my company to where I am starting to see progress. The survival rate is 98% respectively for most age groups who are healthy. I currently know 2 people with COVID who are fine and know several people who have had COVID and all have recovered. Most people who have died in the past year in Canada even when COVID wasn’t the direct cause had COVID written as the cause of death. They’re are countless videos on the internet with hospitals from all over the world showing COVID units and ICU units empty. A simple search will show the videos. As stated above the overdose deaths in Canada have increased over the last year but no one has reported on that. The suicide rates in Canada have increased as a direct result to COVID and lockdowns but no one reports on that. The oncology departments are operating at 60% respectively and once COVID is over there will be a dramatic increase in cancer diagnosis or people who could have their lives saved with a diagnosis. But no one reports on that. Not to mention all of the respiratory and health affects and skin affects constant mask wearing have. The flu has seemingly all but disappeared this year which is also a virus spread in a very similar was to COVID. However social distancing measures have all but eliminated that but not COVID. And dispite some of the strictest lockdowns COVID cases still rise? Something just doesn’t add up for me. But what do I know, I’m just a dumb construction guy sharing my worthless 0.2."

He’s 7, I can see some older kids doing alright with it, but being younger and he also has ADHD it’s a bit of a struggle. I can’t imagine trying to teach 20 kids on zoom. I really really hope the kids go back to real class in the fall, kinda lost hope for this year. There is going to be a massive education gap with kids, some were able to flourish online, some not, some probably weren’t even able to with both parents working essential jobs and such."

1072650,Ronzo,2021-04-26 11:51:00,124,"Doing at home school right now, I have a three year old, a six year old, an an eight year old. Six and eight have done online learning all year long, and you're right, no interaction with friends is very hard. When restrictions have lightened, we've had playdates with our other bubble family. We chose to keep them at home because Six year old has bad asthma, and we felt we'd be keeping him at home often anyhow, given the self-screening for symptoms that everyone is supposed to do prior to school each day. We ended up removing our eight year old from online learning and homeschooling her for the year. Teachers have had a hard time (my sisters are both teachers) and many have busted their butts to try to keep the kids going, but the teacher my daughter had wouldn't budge from trying to teach it like an in-person class. What a total crap show. Kids in the class crying because they were stuck with a computer problem and the teacher wouldn't let them ask for help! I run an IT business, so I homeschool my daughter while I work, while my wife balances keeping the six year old on track with eLearning and keeping the three year old busy. It's hectic. Academically, they're doing alright, but they've gotta get back to being ""in the herd"" and socializing with other students... Our entire household is really hoping for in-school learning to return to somewhat-normal in September."
1072651,lew,2021-04-26 12:13:00,12766,My kids were born in '67 & '72 and thankfully there was nothing even close happening back then like what's going on in schools today. We were also fortunate that I earned enough money that my wife didn't have to work and could stay home with the kids when they were small and we almost never needed a babysitter. I really feel sorry for parents today who need both incomes but with the on-line learning someone has to stay home and give up that 2nd income. It must be terribly hard on so many families moneywise and so many have probably even lost their homes because of it. Not really going anywhere with this other than just sorta thinking out loud but my wife and I haven't really been affected by this virus other than some travel plans have been interrupted but I just feel so bad for the 1000's that have been hit so hard by it all.
1072652,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-26 12:21:00,602,"I was off 6 months last year, some of that by choice and some because of no work. I’m an Audio Visual Contractor in the GTA. I was able to use my time off to build my garage basically all by myself with the help of my dad when he was able to get down. So at least that was a plus for me, saved about 25-30k by doing all the work myself. Work has been a little hit and miss this year so far, I do a lot of rack work. George brown college and hydro one orillia so far.  We have done alright financially but can’t keep this up forever. It sucks for my kid being an only child and I was really hoping he would have been able to spend time with friends last year and this year, here’s hoping by this summer at least."
1072489,Rizzo,2021-04-23 12:14:00,4754,"see and i would say this is proof that they DON'T work. If they did, why did we need 3 of them? In my opinion, all lockdowns do is slow the inevitable. These stats prove it. A virus will do what a virus will do. You can't stay locked down forever (unless you are retired!). So THAT is what they should have done....""lock down"" the vulnerable, and let others carry on with their lives."
1072490,AKRISONER,2021-04-23 12:17:00,5558,"And end up with what happened in the United States with people dying at 2x the rate that Canadians did. Curious, what number of dead people are you comfortable with? we’re at just over 20,000 so we bump that to 40k? Funny that’s the same number of Canadians that died in world war 2...that’s acceptable?"
1072491,Rizzo,2021-04-23 12:29:00,4754,"So the US has a higher death rate...how do you know Canada will not catch up? The lockdowns slow things down...at the end of all this the death rates may actually be similar. We all will die some day (unless the world ends first!). In my work have first hand experience with all types of death. Almost every single covid death I have seen has been in people 80 and over...and almost every one of those, the family told me the person was in very poor health as it was. In other words, they were already near the end of their life. I think I have only seen one under the age of 70 (that person was 69, and also in poor health). So I am not ""comfortable"" with any death, but I do understand that death can not be beaten...it is inevitable. If I saw numerous younger people dying I would change my tune perhaps. But I have not seen that. What I HAVE seen is a ridiculous increase in overdose deaths during this pandemic...and I mean ridiculous...like more than one a week. For instance in the past month we have had one covid death (that person was over 90) but I have seen approx 10 overdose deaths, the oldest of those people was just over 50. THAT is a bigger issue than covid in my opinion. All deaths matter, but for us to think we can ""beat"" death, especially in people over 80, we are fooling ourselves."

Because Nunavut did lockdown last spring.  They closed their three borders tight and implemented two week quarantine periods in isolation hubs for any of their residents and non-essential employees looking to return the territory after being south.  Ottawa, Winnipeg and Yellowknife were the designated sites and throughout most of the year the quarantines worked.  Essential employees were also expected to answer to Public Health with regards to their own social distancing practices for the two weeks prior to travel into Nunavut.  On a small scale, something much easier to evaluate than international travel in and out of Canada, Nunavut represented very well what travel restriction, quarantine, isolation and being responsible can do to thwart the spread of Covid. But then... a case did finally break through.  Nunavut being one of the last places on earth to see a first case, they were quick to act.  Sanikiluaq picked up the first couple cases of Covid, they identified the cases, did the contact tracing and locked the town down, especially isolating the positives.  Poof!!!! Like that, no Covid.  Then another person brought a case from Winnipeg into the airport at Rankin Inlet.  Passengers moving onward landed in Whale Cove and Arviat.  First positives identified, contact tracing complete and Poof!!!  Whale Cove and the bigger hub of Rankin locked it down, did the tracings, isolated the positives and reset their case numbers to zero.  Arviat on the other hand, being totally underserviced, one of the sickest populations in Canada and also the youngest, well... it took six weeks of hard work.  A public health emergency team was deployed there, the Chief Medical Officer traveled there as well and, within about 6 weeks with case numbers in the town of 3000 or so people reached over 300, a lockdown, some big efforts and isolation of the positive cases reset Arviat right back to zero.  Nowhere else in Canada has a case count affected about 10% of any single localized population within such a short time... Looking at Arviat and each other Nunavut community as a small scale version of what is to be the expected outcome of Covid case control, and, also looking at Nunavut's excellent border control as a whole, it's my view that lockdowns, Public Health efforts, healthcare efforts and personal protective practices can totally work.  The problem for the rest of Canada is, not everyone can easily get on board with it for many different reasons.  The one thing that I have found for certain is, that those people who could be on board but instead choose to whine, piss, whine, moan, complain and scream that it doesn't work, they are the biggest plague to bettering the health of Canadians and helping all just get through this."

Yellowknife, 20k people approximately,  a mousefart worth of population compared to Canada's 3 major cities."

It seems like they've tested the entire population of the province a number of times so far.  I believe it is a real virus and is killing, but have lost all confidence I did have in any Politician or government. Everyone saying outdoor activities are fine, gee lets close outdoor activities. It's all a spin all the time every time they talk and I hate it all. They had been talking about a 2nd and 3rd wave forever but did nothing to prepare for it. What pisses me off more is a few weeks ago they seemed soooooo surprised with the numbers they were getting and the variant taking off when they had been projecting 10k cases a day for months and months and months and were always wayyyyyyy off.  Left borders open for the very variant that we are dealing with now and the double double triple mutant is already here.

If anything I could’ve made a pile of OT this year if I wanted to.  But I find it loathsome money and won’t touch it.  I think a lot of those in support haven’t been touched by the realities of many.    Anyway we are where we are.

1072486,AKRISONER,2021-04-23 11:31:00,5558,"This graph literally shows that large cities with high population density suffer severely with the disease (New York city and Los Angeles) and places that disregard lockdowns/covid measures also have the most cases of disease (texas, Florida) therefore directly proving that covid safety measures/lockdowns do work. There’s loads and loads of data out there showing how disregarding covid measures ie not wearing masks and not locking down at all had the most significant negative impact those populations. Conspiracy theorists love to point to outliers like New York and LA...the places that are most dense with the most multi cutural population ended up with the most cases of covid. Look at the stats on the west coast where the population density is similar and it’s not cold all winter and see what comes up when comparing to Florida and texas. you’ll note the case’s per population are actually the lowest in the country aside from the middle grain belt states. Even California’s case count in relation to population is extremely low. by the way, I don’t know what the hell kind of “severe” lockdowns you are referring to in california. Great, their measures were severe by texas and Florida standards but if you follow basically anyone in LA on Instagram (almost any celebrity) it sure as hell doesn’t appear like there were any severe lockdowns. You want to see those, look at New Zealand and Australia and how they handled their lockdowns and how effective they were. Australia has basically not been locked down since last summer. as Bill pointed out, our lockdowns were implemented wrong, they allowed high powered businesses to disregard any measures and it really screwed up our system. Please don’t point to the United States as “the place that got it right” people quite literally died in the US at twice the rate of canada when looking at it comparison to their population. 570,000+  Dead now, That’s almost the entire population of New Brunswick. I would also argue that that number is severely understated because healthcare is not free. Heck a covid test in the United States cost $100+ so how can you tell me anything is accurate in regards to their figures. Furthermore you think the folks that live in poverty in the back woods of alabama and West Virginia are getting top notch medical care? another place that has no ability to lockdown simply due to population density and corruption is India. They opened everything up and look what’s happening, they are “reporting” 300,000 cases per day! Remember only the wealthiest of the population in that country receive medical care. You can only imagine how many people are actually infected in a place as unsanitary and densely populated. we’ve proven it 3 times in a row, lockdowns/stay at home orders work. 3 waves we’ve gone through and within a week case numbers begin to drop every single time. We are already dropping our cases in Ontario. And every time we get out of the lockdown our cases go up again."

As far as ICUs being full they aren’t. Same Bull over and over. Last year this time my father was in the hospital with health complications and media was blowing up saying the icus were full. I went to icu and Covid unit at the hospital where he was staying. Ghost town. People can’t continue to have their lives and livelihoods ruined. If people are responsible and safe like they’re supposed to be every time you go out on the water then why shouldn’t they be allowed to. If you don’t want to fish stay home. More fish for us.

But that's the day before the 2-4 weekend starts. So guess what's coming? You guessed it, another lock down. It never ends. Walmart and SuperStore were packed, international flights in and out, but that's ok.  Boating and fishing are the main super spreader of Covid don't you know?

How many times have any of us ended up in ICU from a fishing trip? I am gonna put those odds at about 1 in 100 000. Far more end up in there from alcohol and drug use...yet that seems permissible Hospitals overwhelmed? When we were in lockdown last year I went to the hospital. I had injured myself playing hockey before lockdown, but I waited awhile to go because the hospitals were apparently overwhelmed. Finally when the pain wouldn't subside I went in. What I saw was a shock! Honestly you could have shot a cannon through the Guelph hospital! I have never been served so quickly in my life. Checked in, met a doctor, had an xray, met a doctor again to get the news, and then back in my car driving away in less than 45 minutes! There were tons of staff hanging out at the nursing station talking to each other. The hallways, meeting rooms and waiting areas vacant. I acknowledge I was in emerg not icu, but seriously...if icu was so stretched why did they not re-allocate some staff or room from emerg? Lakes will still be there in a month - I hope so!

1072317,AKRISONER,2021-04-20 15:41:00,5558,"guys,  I am 100% on your side that so much of this stuff doesnt make any sense. Without being political our politicians are 100% accountable for what is going on.  But lets not get into the conspiracy theory garbage ""the ICU's arent full"" Theres quite literally only 1,200 ICU beds in Ontario. 750 of them are currently occupied with covid patients. That quite literally leaves 450 beds for every single other person that needs to go into intensive care in the entire province. Think about what you are saying for a second. Basically any person that is in danger of dying ends up in the ICU, what happens if a natural disaster, terrorist attack or any other form of mass casualty event occurs, i guess we are going to leave it once again on the doctors to decide who lives and dies? People pushing for us to not care until the ICU's are literally totally full so that in the event that you get in a car crash you will simply be left for dead because there is no space is a strange way to think. If you want to talk about the Covid situation being a mess, have at it, but lets not completely disregard what doctors nurses and those in the medical field are going through at the moment. My direct team member at work's wife is a nurse, she is not trained nor certified to work with intubated people with severe cases of covid, but guess where she started working this week due to staffing shortages. You guessed it, she has been assigned to the covid ward out of desperation. Please Please Please do not make light of the situation at our hospitals at the moment.   	I invite you to talk to any nurse/doctor or other healthcare practitioner working with covid patients prior to announcing that your hospital is totally fine on a fishing forum.

Pre-Covid they averaged 50-60 patients in the ICU at a time because they are the biggest trauma hospital in the area. Since Covid they have dedicated 10 of those ""wards"" for individual Covid cases reducing the ICU capacity to 40 patients max. Yes, the ICU there is full but they reduced the overall capacity by 33%. A week ago 3 Covid patients were from the Hamilton area and 7 were transfers from the GTA. It's not hard to see why ICU's are full when they have cut the capacity 20-50% across Ontario. If there wasn't an imposed isolation of Covid patients from eachother while in the hospital there wouldn't be this ICU crunch going on."
