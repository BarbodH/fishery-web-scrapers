913362,acplumber,2015-05-02 11:59:00,28,Hi fellow OFCer's Heading up to Lowell lake lodge at the end of May for 4 days What lakes around the area have decent walleye fishing in them. We have a quad and a trailer with a 12' tinny so getting to a back lake shouldn't be a big deal. Thx

913444,Joeytier,2015-05-03 11:10:00,3990,I'd have to look on a map...only went there once.  Within eyeshot of the firetower.

Better off going to Temagami Shores - better acommodations, restaurant, friendlier young couple, right on big lake Temagami. You can walk into the village."
