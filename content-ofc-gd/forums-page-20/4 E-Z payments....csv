1072348,kickingfrog,2021-04-20 22:52:00,8333,...of $287 for a lure. Now I need a rod that can swing a 43oz bait.  
1072349,Dara,2021-04-20 23:11:00,3052,I need a fish that can eat a 21.65 inch lure Not likely even a Simcoe perch
1072356,BillM,2021-04-20 23:25:00,17367,"You should see what a Wishmaster muskie lure goes for, lol."
1072360,kickingfrog,2021-04-20 23:54:00,8333,That thing retails for $1147.99.
1072372,grimsbylander,2021-04-21 12:50:00,3016,"The ultimate status symbol?? A lure? lol I guess you hook it on a chain and wear it around your neck. The crazy part is, they'll sell them. "
1072374,lew,2021-04-21 13:34:00,12766,I've paid $85 for lures before but anything more than that is getting just plain crazy.
1072375,AKRISONER,2021-04-21 13:35:00,5558,"the funny thing about the wishmasters is that they just look like a normal musky bait. I remember fisherpete showing me one and I was slightly confused lol but who the hell am i to talk, i pay $30 for a giant Dog X instead of $9 for a zara spook all to catch bass...I have no idea why either cause I caught a lot with the zara lol."
1072387,BillM,2021-04-21 15:13:00,17367,Wishmaster don't look like anything special.    I don't think the fish care to be honest
1072388,glen,2021-04-21 15:17:00,2641,"All lure prices are off the charts crazy.  Muskie baits are starting at $30.  The same ones I bought for $10, 15 years ago."
1072390,Snidley,2021-04-21 15:46:00,620,"A Rapala J13 is now $18 a Bass Pro. A Williams Whitefish is $19 there. Our PM, Fluffy, claims they have a handle on inflation. I have an easy chair called a Stressless chair from Norway. It's a nice chair I paid top dollar for years ago. I believe it was about $1200 which is a lot for a chair particularly back then.  I was at a high end furniture shop down the street from me here in St Catharines and the cheapest Stressless chair was $6200. Freakin' Norwegians. I hate to think what a Franky Bait costs these days because they were $125 years ago. They really work however."
1072391,lew,2021-04-21 16:02:00,12766,My current truck cost 4 1/2 times what my 1st house cost....THAT'S inflation  LOL
1072392,Snidley,2021-04-21 16:08:00,620,"An new Cadillac Escalade is $102,000 USD. Rappers better start working the B's and H's harder"
1072395,glen,2021-04-21 16:46:00,2641,“cheapest Stressless chair was $6200. “ the price of the chair adds more stress then the chair could ever take away.
1072398,akaShag,2021-04-21 17:27:00,2073,and when you get that lure snagged do you hire James Cameron and his submersible to retrieve it?  😮
1072408,Snidley,2021-04-21 18:40:00,620,"Same store had a Canadian brand chair that was not a Stressless brand chair but was way nicer looking, with equally quality leather and a motorized massage function that was only $1800.  Maybe we should buy up all the Canadian easy chairs and sell them to Norwegians like a reverse Canuck arbitrage in furniture. Trouble was that you had to order the Canadian chair and the wait time was 8 weeks or so.  The Canadian manufacturer made a nice chair, for a great price but he must be making them in his basement with one helper who is off work more than on because he's being paid more to stay home than turn up for work. Could tis lead to disaster?"
1072414,craigdritchie,2021-04-21 19:37:00,1586,"I've caught fish on all sorts of crap while joking around with friends: cigarette butts, gummy bears, surgical tubing, a ripped plastic bag, and even a carrot (trolled 70 feet down off a downrigger on Lake Ontario, no less). No way I'm coughing up $1,100 for a designer fishing lure. That said, good luck to the guy selling it. If he can find some fool to pay that much, then why not? Kind of reminds me of the artist who duck-taped a banana to the gallery wall then sold it for $120 grand."
1072415,Snidley,2021-04-21 19:58:00,620,Back in the day Donovan Leitch convinced some of us that smoking banana peel was the way to a legal high. You would not believe how hard it is to keep a banana peel lit. The banana is close to free but the hernia you got trying to smoke it was expensive and painful.
1072422,Dara,2021-04-21 23:20:00,3052,What horse power is it  You can't get a 2 for that now
1072423,Dara,2021-04-21 23:23:00,3052,"Hey, Thats where the part time high school drama teachers assistant says the luxury tax kicks in. And only at 250k for a new boat....something tells me his buddies want new boats  sorry to be political but its so funny"
1072425,John Bacon,2021-04-22 00:31:00,3277,"Total rip off.  If you shop around, you can get one for under a grand.  😉    although that is without hooks."
1072426,crappieperchhunter,2021-04-22 00:44:00,2582,Or perhaps just an indication how old you are lew😀
