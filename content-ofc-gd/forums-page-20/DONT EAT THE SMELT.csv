I am GLAD we have a guideline in this province for eating sportfish.  I do consult it from time to time, especially if I am fishing a new-to-me area and intend to catch a meal or two.  Hmmm, Quinte walleye: mercury, mirex, PCB, insecticides and dioxin, yum yum!!! I am guessing that the MNRF is NOT responsible for advising the public about consumption limits for commercially caught fish, but that's just a guess. Doug"
