1071246,Raycaster,2021-03-14 21:36:00,528,"Trying to squeeze in some camping/fishing time and the first week of may is available. Unfortunately, Balsam PP is not open? So I am wondering being so early if I should bring the boat at all since most fish are OOS. Would not mind chasing pike if they are available... Actually never been to that park and unsure of boating facilities etc.  Any help appreciated, thanks.  "

1071772,b_cdot,2021-04-04 04:00:00,270,Always lots of aggressive pike in the bay. Lots of good perch fishing to be had in may and june some years too.

Good luck I also will be up that way that weekend!Â  As long as the ramp stays open, which I think it will."
1072276,woodenboater,2021-04-19 23:50:00,2277,"should be lots of info on this Ontario Parks page.  basically, camping as far as I know, is not happening. day use is open. http://www.ontarioparks.com/covid19"
1072277,irishfield,2021-04-20 00:03:00,26272,Was gonna say... you ain't camping. Day use only until the stay at home order is over..
1072285,woodenboater,2021-04-20 01:40:00,2277,just in time for the 2/4 long weekend
1072682,RookieReeler17,2021-04-26 18:34:00,25,"They most likely will extend it to ""prevent"" people from gathering.Â Â ðŸ™„Â  But then Ontario Parks will lose a ton of money being the 2nd busiest weekend in the year for them... as long as they make the money."
