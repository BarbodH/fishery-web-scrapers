It's been insanely busy trying to maintain a living in these COVID conditions but luckily I was able to maintain my sanity with a fair bit of ice fishing! Missed the Toronto Boat Show, Spring Fishing & Boat Show, Ottawa Boat Show, Barrie Sportsman Show and all the other spring consumer shows. So I ended up spending more days on the hardwater than I have in a few decades, definitely helped me through the winter! Whenever I went out on a foray onto the ice with friends, we always travelled in separate vehicles, had our own huts, gassed up at home and brought whatever snack we needed to make it through the day! Had many stellar days but of course some tough ones as well, that's why they call it fishing & not catching!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Â Lots of hi-lites though: Anyway, glad that open water season is here and I hope that everyone had a great ice season! Here are a few pics from this last winter!                        "
