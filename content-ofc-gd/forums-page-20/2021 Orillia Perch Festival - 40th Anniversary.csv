I have had lots of ties to the city of Orillia and have been participating in this event for probably over 35 years. It is a great event designed to get everyone out fishing, kids , families and drew many visitors from far & wide to the ""Sunshine City""! Due to COVID times there are plenty of changes, the most recent one is the change of dates to May 8 - 29, 2021 to comply with province of Ontario's ""Stay at Home"" order! For the first time it has also become a virtual event: I hope that everyone takes advantage of these new changes and enters this awesome fishing event, this may be your year! Best of luck to all!

1072026,David Chong,2021-04-14 13:22:00,836,"I do believe that is still being discussed at town council and possibly during the current ""Stay at Home"" order, hence the change of dates. Because of the virtual format of the event you don't actually have to go up to Orillia to partake in the event. You can fish and enter a perch anywhere in Simcoe County and all waters and shorelines of Lakes Simcoe & Couchiching!"
