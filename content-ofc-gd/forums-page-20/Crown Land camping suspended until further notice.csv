KFLA is dropping and I am sure that lockdown is helping with that but you can't lock things down forever.  Sooner or later even gov't money runs out. IMHO, until a majority of the population is vaccinated nothing is going to change.  Just look at history.  Numbers go up and a lockdown is implemented.  Numbers go down and things start to open up, then numbers go up and another lockdown happens.  Wash rinse repeat. In the states, Michigan had some of the strongest lockdowns in the country and now have the highest covid numbers in the country.

Luckily the company is not gigantic about 40 employees and ownership is 100% on board with doing everything in their power to keep people safe. They have provided full paid leave to any of the staff that have even been exposed never mind contracted covid. well anyways today my brother was describing the fact that he has one employee that is on a company mandatory quarantine after returning from his month long vacation in India. Another employee leaves Monday to go see family in India for three weeks. Both were working out scheduling with my brother and he found out that due to the fact that both of these employees are “essential” just like absolutely anyone else that is still working (check the essential list of businesses) you are exempt from the mandatory 14 day quarantine. I knew this was the case for truckers but I never put two and two together that it simply applies to anyone thats “essential” so this entire “14 day hotel thing” is entirely bogus and doesn’t actually exist except in the limited case where a foreigner comes here isn’t working.  my mind is frigging absolutely blown. My brother has told the employees that they are both not allowed to return to work without quarantining and providing a negative covid test. But without his companies policy there’s literally no quarantine for people traveling to India, Brazil etc etc  mind friggin blown"

1072260,Big Cliff,2021-04-19 16:51:00,6899,"Sorry, the sarcasm went right over my head, I am not use to that from you! So, would you feel better if a 75 year old who lives alone stayed in his own house alone when he could be out in the bush with no interaction with anyone else? My motor coach has 1000 km range. The fuel tank is full, I don't even have to stop for fuel. I  have enough food here to last me for 2-3 months and the ability to take that with me so I don't even have to go into town for supplies. My property there is fully serviced, water, septic, hydro. I have already given up so much in the intrest of doing my part, Christmas, my son's 50th birthday, the birth of a great grandaughter. If you can give me one valid reason why my isolating there where I can fish and hunt without having to contact anyone else is going to put anyone at risk then I  will consider it."
1072264,Dara,2021-04-19 17:09:00,3052,"In your instance Cliff I wouldn't have a problem with it and would do it myself. I was quoted by people agreeing with me about locking health zones then they say you should travel. I really don't know what to say. We need to isolate from others and if we do that nothing should be a problem.  I want to go fishing on my own but doubt there is a spot open to launch my boat. I do go to my cabin a few miles out of town with just my dog because it's actually safer than walking it in town. I do think that with all the other stuff in place there should be restrictions on health zones at least because thats the only way I can think to keep people from moving around. We have no vaccines here because they are all being allotted to the hot spots. So, people need to stay in their hot spots rather than spreading this virus. I sit here wishing I could at least get an astra shot when I hear people in hot spots are turning it down Its a very frustrating and depressing situation I can't go visit my only granddaughter for her 2nd birthday. I have seen her all of 2 times so far and she lives in Canada "
1072265,Duckie,2021-04-19 17:14:00,305,"its one thing to protest lockdowns because people need to go work to earn money to pay bills and live etc its quite another to believe Covid is all a big scam - that site looks like it leans towards the latter. it preaches removing masks and posts old videos from the early days of the pandemic with information that has since been corrected as we learned more about the virus (eg masks dont work, 50% false positives etc)"
1072269,cisco,2021-04-19 20:56:00,597,"Sorry Duckie but it may be both real and a scam. (Virus is real and the response has been criticized as basically a way to funnel wealth and power upwards. I don't see anyone here saying it's not a real virus. I see concerns that it is being used for other purposes and I read that many are questioning the need for lock downs. Me, I posted something many here missed so I'll post it again. EVERYONE should be aware of such 'possible' cures for covid which are NOT even mentioned in MSM or from our elected and non elected 'bosses'. https://noqreport.com/2021/02/25/peer-reviewed-study-ivermectin-cuts-covid-infections-deaths-by-75/ As a researcher it seems odd that the many doctors and jurisdictions in the world who are using this are basically being called 'liars'. If so and since they aren't doing it for profit since the med is not patented and so cheap, then the doctors/office people/corp owners who disagree or question the honesty of these doctors are also liars. I will say this. I personally know a chap that was a 'long hauler' re aftermath of covid. A couple months of not even wanting to get out of bed to go to work. Now, after approx 3 wks after taking 3 Iv pills he is 100% he says. IMO it took this time to heal his internal organs after stopping the virus which was still sneaking around inside him. Right now the former patent owner of Iv has announced a 'new treatment' which many think is just a rework of Iv in order to gain patent thus $billions$. Why am I telling you all this? So a few may forward questions/pressure to our 'leaders' to properly investigate/review Iv and hopefully to allow its use to end all this reverse Robin Hood nonsense of the rich taking from the poor to give to the rich. Word is slowly getting out with pharmacy mags even stating in articles that Iv works. The only way to hide it is to stop us from hearing about it and to push vaccines as savior."
1072270,cisco,2021-04-19 21:24:00,597,I keep watch on vids re Drs claiming positive results. They aren't liars. Insane to think what they are telling the world is bogus. https://noqreport.com/2021/02/25/peer-reviewed-study-ivermectin-cuts-covid-infections-deaths-by-75/
1072283,Crimsongulf,2021-04-20 01:34:00,294,"At some point the Canadian gov't has to take vaccinations into account.  As of now the official CBSA stance is ""There are no exceptions for vaccinated travelers  at this time"".  We already have the  ArriveCan app downloaded and will do the same as last year.  In prior years we would say we were going to the cottage, last year we just gave the county road address. We could run into an issue bringing the little boat across but we have checked into having a transport take it across the border, but either way that isn't a deal breaker."
1072286,scuro2,2021-04-20 01:59:00,904,"Boy you're pushing this one hard. Funny that the whole rest of the world missed this miracle. It's a plot. It's a juicy narrative, it's a conspiracy theory."
1072288,cisco,2021-04-20 03:07:00,597,"Yes I am pushing this hard. You are having fun pushing hard dissing doctors? What qualifies you? Did you even watch the video before planning how to attack? The rest of the world hasn't missed this medication. Maybe look at just the last vid to say why just this one doctor is wrong or lying. Again, I am pushing this 'hard'. From all I have read and observed I am cynical of MSM and what we are being told because I do research and have found many examples of bias in the research that has been done to disprove anything and everything except about the experimental vaccines. If a 'magic bullet' to cure and to stop the virus was indeed a reality then this would be a worthwhile thing for most of us anyway. But certainly not for all. Not for you it seems. Rather than constantly offering hollow negative assertions perhaps do some research re what doctors who are using it around the world are saying. Oh and I mean doctors rather than regulators or Big Pharma or cynics such as yourself."
1072291,scuro2,2021-04-20 04:27:00,904," Quack cures are a dime a dozen for CV19. So are quack Drs and quack published papers in support of these miracle cures. Rule of thumb, if no national health agency is interested in this then it's not worth my time to go do my ""individual research"" on youtube or other stray websites. If it had validity and could save countless lives the world would take notice. Pushing this on OFC won't speed up that process. Try politcians, some are actively looking for red herrings."
1072343,cisco,2021-04-20 21:19:00,597,"Thank you for your highly clinical and scientific and medical analysis. Hahaha! For the record I and others are pressuring agencies to review Ivermectin. I am here since many may feel there is no hope. I know some members here and like them. So I want to give members hope that a cheap and easy cure may be present regardless of the naysayers with no credible reasoning behind their attacks. For the record here I am stating that Ivermectin will become the 'standard of care' for treating covid. Me, I have had both vaccine shots due to the work I do. I am not an anti-vaxer. Vitamin D3, C, and zinc are taken daily. Our gov't isn't even advising on ways to boost our immune systems. I have also read Finland has achieved proper vitamin D levels since 2014 by adding it to milk products. Finland has by far the lowest virus cases and mortality rates and has stopped shut down methods from what I have read. Why hasn't our gov't advised on at least vitamin D? Maybe I missed it. IMHO incompetence or some other reasoning......   "
1072368,Duckie,2021-04-21 12:39:00,305,they aren't because unless you have antibodies in your immune system already (which you won't unless you have either had the virus previously or been vaccinated and allowed the time for your immune system to build them up) having a good immune system does very little to stop yourself from being infected if exposed. thats how viruses work. its not the same as bacteria. Viruses are very good at infecting otherwise healthy people who have strong immune systems. thats why are they such a problem. 
1072137,GregF2,2021-04-16 23:37:00,46,"Trudeau has done nothing, especially on vaccines.  Funny - how Canadian media was blasting US last year on Covid.  How the tide turned.  Sad.  I just want both Countries to get this under control, so I can travel to to Canada again.  Really miss it and the people. Amazing to me how Canadians can fly to the States, but we can’t fly to Canada.   Trudeau has no clue, especially on his constant lockdowns. At least let vaccinated people in when it gets more under control.  Can’t stay buttoned up forever."
1072140,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-17 00:38:00,602,"Trudeau wants to sit in a circle and hold hands singing songs, useless twit. It's his screw ups that has causes all of this hardship. Also, lockdowns don't work but lets keep trying them again and again and again."

1072149,Dara,2021-04-17 02:56:00,3052,I'm not sure if it's allowed now. I think if you bring your dog and say you're walking it it might be ok but not sure. I hope so because thats next weeks plan but the police can stop you and ask where you're going. Thats another problem because I don't want to tell them my secret fishing spots...jeez
1072154,Big Cliff,2021-04-17 09:15:00,6899,"I live alone, have been tested several times for covid because of medical appointments, always negitive. I have a piece of property in French River, fully serviced lot and a motor coach. I can literly leave here not have to interact with anyone and stay there for the whole summer without having to go into town but under the current guidelines I am not alowed to do that.

1072166,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-17 15:55:00,602,Basically every police precinct has said they won’t be enforcing that rule of stoping people and asking where they are going. I’m sorry how is golf a super spreader? Or a kids playground.  
1072170,Big Cliff,2021-04-17 16:28:00,6899,"If a cop does stop you and give you a ticket, don't blame the cop, they are only doing his/her job. Blame the people that have put him/her in the position where they have to do it. Blame the idiots that have made this necessary!"
1072171,scuro2,2021-04-17 16:42:00,904,"Our infection rate has now surpassed the US infection rate. This is strong evidence that vaccinations work. Our death rate is still way below the US death rate. I do agree that all the outdoor restrictions are counter productive, on the other hand the alternative of no lockdown to curb outbreaks has been proven time and time again around the world to boost your death rate within hospitals to about 10% and lead to many other deaths from other conditions."
1072172,scuro2,2021-04-17 16:50:00,904,"Yes, as a nation we were stupid to become dependent on other nations for vaccinations. Most people don't know that our Pfizer and Monderna supply comes from Europe because the American plants will give us none of their created supply. It has led to delays in our contracted totals. If you wonder why the Europeans are cheesed it's because both the US and GB expect that Canada and other nations get supplied from their European plants. In England's case it is insisting that the Astra Zenca produced in Europe only go to the UK first till they are fully vaccinated.  	So you can rightly blame our government for many things but not supply issues."
1072173,LostAnotherOne,2021-04-17 17:02:00,956,"Golf courses are no way super spreaders.  Just couldn't understand last weekend trying to find a launch cause a bunch that I use were closed down, but golf courses were allowed open.  Both are similar to eachother I think and don't cause much of a threat.  As with being pulled over is the OPP still following through with issuing tickets?  I may be wrong"
1072174,LefroyFisherman,2021-04-17 17:15:00,602,Almost every precinct has said they will not be pulling people over just because.
1072188,cisco,2021-04-18 01:07:00,597,But if a cop does check you for some reason you may be in for it. This morning the news loop interviewed an infectious disease doctor from Trillium down here in the GTA and he said he deals with covid patients and he said they all got the virus from crowded work places or from folks who brought it home from crowded work places. He said it's better to get us outside where more distance is than have us at home crowded with others to more easily spread the virus if one had it. Oh and the vaccine has neither proven to be safe nor effective from all I have read. Our PM was even joked about by US reporters for responding to whether we can stop with masks and social distancing when all are vaccinated.... he replied that ....no we can't cuz over in the UK even though vaccinations have been massive the cases are growing fast. A US expert when asked why cases aren't down due to vaccinations and she said the vaccine effect is a delayed one. what the heck!! When Fausi was asked why Texas has lower cases yet ended lock down a while ago he said maybe cuz they're outside more.....he made no mention that maybe the vaccine is helping. Things sure are confusing.
1072192,scuro2,2021-04-18 03:03:00,904,"I have some questions about the points you made.  	How many millions of doses of vaccine have been given out and how many cases of blood clots are there in Canada? Is there any vaccine that is 100% totally safe? What are your odds of dying if you get covid19 and you are not vaccinated, and what are your odds of dying if you have been vaccinated? Who has claimed that vaccinations gives everyone a 100% immunity? The infection rate is way down in the UK, who claims that it is going way up? Only a 1/3 of all Americans have been vaccinated, why should the virus disappear instantly there now? Infection rates are dropping in southern states but rising in northern states, could Faucci be right?  	Things seem crystal clear to me. vaccinations work.  	With regards to Covid19, the US was a dumpster fire but now look at them. Even with many states having few or no restrictions their infection rate has gone way down and levelled off."
1072193,siwash,2021-04-18 03:52:00,683,"How's everyone enjoying the erosion of your rights and freedoms?  I'm beginning to wonder about this virus. last year I was fairly concerned, mostly for my folks... then people I know got Covid.. a few dozen over the past 12 months last time I counted - no one died. Worst case characterized as a 3 week nasty flu.. most others said mild to moderate symptoms, some no symptoms.. yes, the elderly were hit hard in the homes.. but this is not the first time a flu outbreak has killed elderly people in Canada.  If you can trust the numbers, 3 million deaths out of 8 Billion people.  That ranks pretty average and even on the low side of other diseases killing people.  By the way, more people died of drug overdoses on BC last week than Covid.  I don't know.. this seems like a massive overreaction. Some must be benefiting large from this otherwise there wouldn't  be so much attention.  Schools should not be closed. ALL students should be back in class. This is terrible for young people and equally bad for business and the economy. Wait til the bill is calculated!  Are we mortgaging the future of our children?"
1072194,porkpie,2021-04-18 11:08:00,2521,The order was amended overnight.  You can’t be arbitrarily stopped to be asked where your going.  No Police service save the OPP (and that’s questionable) was going to support a breach of charter rights anyway and they all came out and said it.  It was terrible egg on the face of the government and they should have known better.  That said you can still get gonged for failing to comply with an order if your engaged in some nonsense like a big party etc.  A guy quietly fishing on his own isn’t nonsense.
1072195,scuro2,2021-04-18 11:35:00,904,"If you compare a virus to diseases like cancer then yes, CV19 is no big deal death wise. If you compare CV19 to other virus' that kill people then CV19 is a major killer and is anything but, ""average"". The only thing that compares to it is AIDS, otherwise you have to go back to the Spanish flu of 1918. We did next to nothing to stop AIDS  and we have a similar yearly death rate with AIDS at it's peak. On the other hand we've got 3 million dead and the world has taken extraordinary steps to slow this virus down, what if nothing had been done? Countries like Brazil and India are getting clobbered right now and in India's case it might take 4 years to vaccinate enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. There now is a specific Indian variant. We in the west will be okay because we can vaccinate against future variants. We are not done with CV19 yet and are probably only in the middle innings. This pandemic is one for the history books. Say 5 to 10 million dead is a BIG deal"

1072197,cisco,2021-04-18 12:47:00,597,"Here are some points where Fauci, that US lady expert and our PM are quoted and on video. Sure the vid is from Utbe and Tucker calson but the vids are of the experts and our PM. https://video.foxnews.com/v/6248922358001#sp=show-clips US lady expert at 7:10 Fauci re Texas 8:00 Our PM re the UK  12:20 We should be very happy that pressure applied got Ford to relax some outdoor activity allowances. Many of us are doing what we can to push for outdoor activity rather than indoor virus transmission. We need listen to doctors who treat patients and do proper demographic research to focus on problems rather than imposing broad brush restrictions that are ineffective stopping virus transmission but highly effective re harming our mental health, employment/economy, schooling and so forth."
1072199,scuro2,2021-04-18 13:55:00,904,"There is Fox news and everything else at Fox which they classify as opinion shows. When sued programs like Tucker's claim it is an entertainment show. Their defence is we can't be held accountable to any fact even if our misinformation inadvertently kills people. People know it's all Bull.  	Looking at the specific clips you provided all three are making the point that we can't stop with masks even when a significant portion of the population has been vaccinated. Transmission is still occurring in all states, and in a number of states rates are still going up even with vaccinations because of the new variants. They are far more contagious. Israel with a 54% vaccination rate only today stated that you no longer need to wear masks outside. A very small percentage of people who have been vaccinated still have died or been hospitalized. Most will not get sick but those who do can still transmit CV19. The percentages go way down but they don't disappear.  	Otherwise I agree with the second half of your response."
