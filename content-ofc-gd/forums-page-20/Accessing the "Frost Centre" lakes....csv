1071976,siwash,2021-04-12 03:54:00,683,Hey folks it's been many years since I've been there and I understand that the centre was sold but I am assuming you can still freely access the lakes? I am going in just for a day trip with a kayak on the Kennisis side of the area. Is there anything I should be aware of?  thanks
1071977,misfish,2021-04-12 08:43:00,29133,Maybe contact them ? Here is a link that might help.  https://kawarthanow.com/2021/01/08/opseu-buys-historic-frost-centre-in-haliburton-from-ontario-government-for-3-2-million/

I never had a rod but do recall some guys getting some small specs in the creek that dumps in Nora right at the school."
1071982,mitch seguin,2021-04-12 12:29:00,98,I worked as a Resource Tech there in 1978. The only restricted lake access was the former mill property south of the Frost Centre that was the home of the biologist.  That property was sold separately.

1072003,singingdog,2021-04-13 11:29:00,1047,"If you aren't camping, the lakes are all accessible. If you are camping, most of the lakes are part of the Algonquin Highlands Water Trails system. https://www.algonquinhighlands.ca/trails/water-trails.php"
1072066,turtle,2021-04-15 19:21:00,274,I read that OPSEU (prov govt union) bought the property and buildings on the hwy 35 side.  I have a cottage on the west side of Kennisis and access the lakes in the former Frost Centre at the dam going into Red Pine Lake.
1072089,singingdog,2021-04-16 12:10:00,1047,"Yes, OPSEU did buy it. Doesn't affect access at all as the boat launch at the old Frost Centre was not part of the sale."
