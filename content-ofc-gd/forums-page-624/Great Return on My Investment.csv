510496,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-08 22:58:00,957,"After a few close calls, my two sons married at ages 42 & 39.  My older son got married on his farm on May 1, 2004, I headed to my favorite fishing hole for the walleye opener and returned for younger son's marriage at the top of Starr Mountain, near Chattanooga on May 29, 2004.  We had about a 50 minute hike up the trail to reach the wedding site.  They started coming up with grandchildren in the summer of 2006 and now my younger son has three girls, 17 days old, 22 months old and 4 years, 3 months old.  My older son has a daughter 4 years and one month old, plus an adopted son who is 23 months old.  I brought them up thinking kids and dads were supposed to do stuff outdoors and here's what's going on in their lives.  My older son and his wife picked up their 4 year old daughter from pre-school this afternoon and the four of them, including their son, are canoe camping in primitive campgrounds on Dale Hollow Lake.  They plan to move to a new site on an island every day.  They'll be eating lots of fish.  They've done several overnighters, but this is the first 7 day trip.  My younger son has been working out of town much of the week.  He's working at home today.  His wife, after delivering their newest daughter 17 days ago, took all three girls out rock climbing with two of her friends today.  Yesterday they were at Gee Creek campground and hiked a portion of the trail leading up to their wedding site.  Mom and her three daughters made it home last night around 10:00.  Mom's sister will be watching the three girls tomorrow while my son and his wife go mountain biking for a few hours.  Four year old daughter wants to go sea kayaking on the lower Ocoee/Parksville Lake Sunday.  Yep, it pays to do exciting stuff with youngsters.  In 1969 I received a job promotion that included a free membership in a Country Club.  I turned it down and invested in a Chris Craft Inboard for water skiing and a 14' V hull for fishing.  Being an active member in a Country Club didn't seem right for our family.  I made the right decision.  They were presented a lot of challenges right from the start and they came through.  My daughter, who water skied at age 5, is also into biking, hiking, canoeing and camping.  It's been a great run with a good future."
