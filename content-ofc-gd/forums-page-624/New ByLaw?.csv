509716,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-06 15:25:00,0, I think this is laughable and that this law will not last too long. Just the Auto industries unions alone would make enough noise to kill this bill.
509760,Bitsmith2k,2010-10-06 17:47:00,396, the chip doesnt provide the bank with the ability to 'turn your account off'..
509785,capt bruce,2010-10-06 19:21:00,820,"""the chip doesnt provide the bank with the ability to 'turn your account off'..  Bitsmith2k you got that right ,I was mailed a new ""chip card"" but put in the drawer and forgot about it , Labour day weekend Im up in Manooth and go into town on Sunday morning to pick up some things my debit card does not work ??? say my sorrys and head over to the cibc machine across the street , card does not work !!! call the 1-800 number and Im told they disconnected my swipe card as all cards now have to be chipped and I was mailed a new one why am I not useing it , Sunday long weekend 72 cents in my pocket 300 miles from home and they cut off my money!! After getting thru to a supervisor (22 minutes off my cell ) they gave me a 7 day grace period to activate my chipped card , dont need no chips to cut you off !!!!!"
509791,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-06 19:56:00,2582,"I don't care how many cars you have in your driveway...fit em in with a shoehorn if you have to. My problem is when you park them all over the street. My neighbor directly across from me has 4 grown kids still at home and they all have cars... so 6 adults equals 6 vehicles PLUS him and his son's company work trucks  make 8. AND there garage is so full of junk that they can't park in it. So usually 4-5 vehicles on the street ALL the time, and that's not even counting when they have company because all visitors park on the street as well. It can be a little frustrating getting the boat trailer in and out of the driveway sometimes  Totally illegal for them to park on the street  overnight in the winter because of our snow removal by-laws...but the rest of us are trying to be good neighbors and not complain....but it's getting harder and HARDER to keep quiet.  I'm just patiently waiting for there kids to stop suckling at the teat and move out."
509804,Bitsmith2k,2010-10-06 20:59:00,396," ouch! i had my old, non-pin, card disabled as well. i wasnt nearly as far away from home as you were, but it was frustrating non the less.."
509829,Dara,2010-10-06 23:09:00,3052,"that sounds about right. They gotta pretty up the driveways the same as they are doing for lake superior. They are putting windmills all over it to make it look better...oh wait, no, thats to supply power to toronto...talk about not in my backyard.   Look at it this way...you can just shoot the guy that complains"
509994,jedimaster,2010-10-07 13:41:00,3472,Well I have gone through about 6 chip cards in the last year as I keep leaving it in the stupid debit terminal. Evenutally I won't need on as I'll have one saved for me at every store.
510008,Governator,2010-10-07 14:42:00,879,"  Totally agree with this, happens across the street from me as well.  Also in the townhomes here, their garages all seem to be packed so they park their extra vehicles on the road."
510012,Dara,2010-10-07 15:03:00,3052,"  I had a neighbor that parked on the street just because. I had a heck of a time getting my trailer in the yard. He was out one day and I said its a pita. He said well just come ask me to move it. I said, no, I'll just drive into the side of your van if its in the way.  So 2 weeks later he comes to my door and asks about the big dent in the side of his van. I just smiled and closed the door. He doesn't park there no more."

510098,Flappn,2010-10-07 19:16:00,245,It think it also has to do with renters. I know where I lived they eliminated parking on both side's of the road. When I called they said  that most houses in your area have single car driveways and are intended for single family use. With the increase in renters in basement apartments we are now seeing parking on the street increase and renters are not what we are looking for in this neighborhood.  I gotta tell ya...for all you land lord's out there good for you...but having renters in basements beside my single family dwelling has caused me nothing but grief in the past...so I liked the city's explanation and all for it. I've since moved (because of the renters).

If you live in the big populated city you gotta expect a bunch of crappy rules that keep people in line. It sounds bad but like the other guys say, it keeps the renters from covering the street in cars.  Sure glad I moved away from there...now I gotta go skin this coon  edited to add...just got a phone call from my daughter as i was hitting the post button. Some idiot lowlife just ran into her car in the parking lot and took off"

509618,BFSC Kevin,2010-10-06 01:21:00,1351,"Are you frigging kidding me?     Link: http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101005/new-parking-bylaw-101005/20101005/?hub=TorontoNewHome   Parking in Toronto just got a little more complicated thanks to a new bylaw that restricts how many vehicles homeowners can park on their driveways.  City council quietly passed the regulation, part of the new harmonized zoning bylaw, at its last meeting of the summer, CTV has learned. The bylaw took effect Oct. 1.  The law allows residents with a single-car garage to park one vehicle in the garage and one on the driveway. Those with double garages may park two vehicles in the garage and two on the driveway.  Details can be found in the online version of the bylaws. The parking section (10.5.80) begins on page 29.  The change has sparked some debate among Torontonians.  ""It's nonsense,"" Scarborough resident Sal Lamantia told CTV Toronto's Naomi Parness. ""In terms of my own driveway, it should be my own decision.""  Others say the new rule keeps streets looking cleaner.  The law was created after some residents complained others were turning their driveways into parking lots, city officials said.  The city will rely on complaints in enforcing the restriction, officials said. Fines will be determined in court, and could reach up to $5,000.  The regulation is being grandfathered in, meaning residents used to packing several cars on the driveway are still allowed to do so.  They'll have to show they've been doing it for a while, which could prove difficult, said Lance Cumberbatch, director of the municipal standards and licensing division.  Residents buying or building new homes will be most affected by the change.  At least one resident has appealed the bylaw, sending the matter to the Ontario Municipal Board for review."

509638,Duckie,2010-10-06 02:24:00,305,ps:  so what if you have people over and they park in your driveway and you are now over the limit. will you be fined $5000 if someone complains? LOL
509640,ADB,2010-10-06 02:32:00,444," It may easily be overturned by the next mayor.  However, they have rules for not being able to park on your lawn, so I guess there is a precedent for being able to tell you what you can and can't do on your property ""for the good of the neighbourhood."""

Well, now is the time so speak up.  Use the media if needed but speak your voice or be shut out...  Ford vs????  Ya, you know he's next...  It's kind of like ""NOOOOOOOO BODY!!""

509654,chilli,2010-10-06 03:42:00,199,There's always at least one attention distraction during every election. This bylaw needs to be tested quick but you have to ask; what exactly are they trying to draw attention away from?

509678,Fish4Eyes,2010-10-06 12:21:00,1022,A few residents complaining about people having too many cars will be nothing compared to the number of complaints the city will receive if this bylaw is implemented. I bet the city is drooling at the thought of up to $5000 fines.

We think we do, however, should the city decide to do something with your property, you have very little recourse against them... you may ""own"" your house, but essentially, your ""rent"" your land from the Corporation that is the city. It's my understanding that existing house will have their parking situation grandfathered, by the city, meaning that only new homes will have to abide by this new by-law... and the city officials have indicated that they will only investigate/charge folks based on complaints received.
