509371,NAW,2010-10-05 13:22:00,4022,I'm glad to see you've changed your mind from the 6hp you where talking about earlier this year.
509375,craigdritchie,2010-10-05 13:47:00,1586,"Moot point anyway, as not one company even makes a two-stroke 9.9 any more. In that power range, Yamaha, Merc, Suzuki, Honda, Nissan, Tohatsu and APS only deal in four-strokes now. Even Evinrude doesn't build one - closest they have is a 15hp E-Tec, which I'm told is tough to obtain since it's essentially a de-tuned 25."
509690,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-06 13:18:00,3761,Anybody know what speed range I could achieve with my boat and a 9.9hp? The boat is 12'long and very deep it feels.
509704,Fisherman,2010-10-06 14:09:00,7201,"Rough guess, maybe 15-18km/h, give it a burst with a GPS."
509705,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-06 14:12:00,0,when you're solo it will move quick.  every bit of gear will increase your drag on a boat that small though.
509731,Fish4Eyes,2010-10-06 16:45:00,1022," These motors are abused and beat up, as sometimes they are operated by inexperienced individuals. I would be weiry purchasing a resort motor."
509807,scugpg,2010-10-06 21:17:00,1373," With 2 guys and a casting deck, battery, trolling motor....I bet around 12-14mph Can it hold a 15? That would get you around 20+ with 2 people. 25 with just you...that might be a little scary though in a 12.  Do you plan on fishing with the boat loaded and with a buddy most of the time?  Now's the time to research and decide man...its a big purchase and the last thing you want is to be disappointed with it."
509984,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 13:01:00,5865,"Bottom line is......spending $3,000.00 PLUS TAX on a outboard for a car top 12' boat is NUTS !  !  !  Find a good used motor at 1/3 that price of less and it will serve you until you get a bigger boat and you will if you fish much.  Bob"
510004,SlowPoke,2010-10-07 14:17:00,2984," I tend to agree.... unless.... the motor you buy today will be with you for twenty years or become the kicker motor for the next boat you buy. Otherwise, you'll never realize its worth."
510316,scugpg,2010-10-08 12:20:00,1373,Probably can find a 9.9  4 stroke in the $1500 range that isn't too old. But if that merc is $2300 thats not bad.  Do your research......you'll find something that works.
510332,GBW,2010-10-08 13:42:00,8460,"Mike, did you check kijiji?  If you like one you see, get a set of muff's and go test it out before you buy.  Some of these ad's are for a full pacakge for less then $1000.00. http://toronto.kijiji.ca/f-9-9-outboard-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-Oshawa-Durham-Region-W0QQCatIdZ29QQKeywordZ9Q2e9Q20outboardQQLocationZ1700275"
510340,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-08 13:57:00,3761," I agree, that price isn't too bad at all. I don't know, there is just something about a used motor that i'm not interested in. Getting a new outboard means it should run true from the moment I use it. I'll have it for years and I can trust something that I have taken care of."
510343,GBW,2010-10-08 14:00:00,8460,"Mike, if you test it (a used one) before you buy it then you will feel better about your puchase.  My Honda is over 10 years old and runs like a brand new unit.  I bet it will still be going strong in another 10 years.  *edit* if you want to see what I mean on Sat. then PM me and you are more then welcome to check out my Honda.  BTW, mine isn't for sale."
510371,Billy Bob,2010-10-08 15:51:00,5865,My Johnson is now 25 years old and this year I finally had to pay for a thermostat to be installed..........that's it besides plugs and 2 impellers which is really just maintenance.  Bob
510372,scugpg,2010-10-08 16:01:00,1373, Not only that but there's usually a 3yr warranty that gives you peace of mind not having to spend $$$ on major repairs just keep it maintained.  I bought a used 4 stroke this year maybe had 10hrs on it. I lucked out its been a champ. As long as its not a camp motor I wouldn't be concerned about buying a late model used.
510544,danc,2010-10-09 01:44:00,4677,"With our dollar nearly at par, these are worth checking out.  Nissan @ Cabelas"

510547,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-09 02:26:00,3761, Those look awesome wow great link. Do you think it would be easy to get them fixed and worked on around here?
508908,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-03 20:50:00,3761,"Hello again OFC, hope everybody has been catching more fish than I have been. Haven't been out in a few weeks for any fishing...got to handle lot's last week during my Fall Field Camp on Sturgeon but it's just not the same!!  Anyway, Dad and I are up for a 9.9hp motor for our 12' boat. I know it might be a small boat but hey in my eye's I'll always need and use a small boat, northern Ontario trips,back lake camping, or for the next few years while I'm still in school this boat will stay in our family for a long time. We have decided on getting a 9.9hp 4 stroke outboard. A clean, quiet, fuel efficient NEW motor.  Here are a few options I have looked at. And of course prices will change when dealers offer specials and rebates. My main question is what brand...I've looked into Mercury, Yamaha, Honda, and Suzuki motors and all are priced in the same range.  Here is my little research chart on the different weights with these motors with the prices(except Mercury, stupid site doesn't have one price on it...not very helpful but if somebody can fill in the blank for me it would be appreciated)  Honda 9.9hp 4 Stroke Short Shaft Manual Start $2999MSRP 92lbs  Mercury 9.9hp 4 Stroke Manual Start Short Shaft Cost______ 83lbs  Yamaha 9.9hp 4 Stroke Manual Start Short Shaft $3157 91lbs  Suzuki 9.9hp 4 Stroke Manual Start Short Shaft Cost_____ 95lbs Well there is what I dug up. In all honestly a Mercury or Yamaha seems to be the best option but I don't want to count out the other two. Looking to hear some stories of customer support, motor servicing at dealerships etc...Just a little insight before getting a boat motor.  Thanks, Mike"
508919,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-03 21:25:00,0,"My work has gradually switched over to the yamaha outboards.  we have a 4hp, a bunch of 8-15hp, and a few 25-30hp, and they are all phenomenal motors.  We put them through hell running the rivers and we've had very few problems.  The only downside I saw of these (and all 4strokes in general) is that they don't idle down nicely like the 2 strokes.  BUT, other than that, I know my next motor will be a yammy (presently I own an early 90's Merc."
508923,Roy,2010-10-03 21:29:00,13728,"Michael, I'd go Yammy or Merc.  I have a Merc 4 stroke 60HP and it idles down to nothing......don't understand why a 9.9 wouldn't."
508930,lew,2010-10-03 21:50:00,12766,"I'm running a 150 Yamaha 4 stroke Mike and after 2 seasons it still purrs like the day I picked it up, and I have full confidence that a smaller Yamaha would be excellent as well."
508931,camillj,2010-10-03 21:51:00,1988,I love my old Johnson Seahorse(s) .. they re great and will putt along at zero-point-five
508935,Grimace,2010-10-03 21:57:00,2020,I have a 2006 mercury 115 4 stroke.  5 seasons of pure bliss. Not 1 problem.  I have a 2003 mercury 9.9 kicker. The same.  From what I can tell you can not go wrong with any of the manufacturers. They all seem to make a solid motor.  Honda's seem  a bit heavy though.  I would not count out a 2 stroke either.  Good luck
508946,Fisherman,2010-10-03 22:53:00,7201,"Here's another place to check prices, my son has an older '92 Honda 8, runs like a top.  I had an old '84 7.5 years ago, never a problem and now a '96 25 Honda on my boat, no problems.  I think if I was to go with another brand, it would be Suzuki. http://www.spmw.com/"

508949,glen,2010-10-03 23:13:00,2641,Buy a brand that you can get parts for.  Oil filters and a repair shop nearby.  Other then that i would get one that will charge a battery.  You might be able to save a few bucks if you can find a good used one.

509020,Raf,2010-10-04 03:58:00,3495,"I think you'll find most people happy with whatever brand they own.  That's a good thing, means they're all pretty good - buy the one you get the best deal on and can service without hassle near you.  Until you start moving up to bigger motors (25-30+), I'd be looking at a 2 stroke if I were you.  1) It'll be cheaper, 2) It'll be lighter - might be a big deal on a 12'.  Modern 2 strokes are pretty darn efficient and clean, the difference between one and a 4-str will be negligable in that size."
509029,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-04 05:07:00,947, Good point.  Service after the sale is very important.  Merc has accomplish this by having the biggest Dealer link in North America.  Majority of Marina's are Merc dealers and service centers.
509085,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-04 14:59:00,947,Here is MSRP from Merc  9.9M 4-Stroke  $3202  our pricing  $2342
509094,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-04 15:23:00,3761, I'll be in touch with a price like that. Send me a msg in a few months if you remember but that's a very good price in my eyes
509095,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-04 15:24:00,947,Yea Mike.  no probs at all all brand new 2010 outboards
509096,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-04 15:40:00,2582," That's why I have a 2 stroke. Some of my fav spots I have to haul the boat and motor into because there is no launch, and the 4 stoke is much heavier.  Your not going to spend much in a season on fuel for a 9.9 regardless if it is a 2 or a 4."
509097,scugpg,2010-10-04 15:41:00,1373,I'd go with a Honda or Yamaha. Merc would be a close 3rd choice. That's just personal preference.  I don't think you can really go wrong with a small motor like that. Like others mentioned warranty and local parts is a big plus.  If the 12 can hold a 15hp I would consider that though. Same weight and don't you have a casting deck etc on it as well? Might like that extra power if it has a deck and a couple of big guys in there.
509099,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-04 16:13:00,0,"Have had many different types of motors from seahorse to Merc. I ended up with two 4 stroke Yammy's one of which is a 9.9. I have heard about and seen issues with larger Mercs, etecs, Johnsons. I havent seen or heard of any with Yamaha.  Different strokes for different folks they say. Hope yer happy with what you decide on.   Then there's Honda."
509115,Grimace,2010-10-04 17:02:00,2020,I would also point out that before 2007 merc 4 strokes were manufactured by Yamaha.  My 2006 merc 115 which I love is technically a yamaha. Not sure about the smaller sizes.
509117,GBW,2010-10-04 17:15:00,8460,"Mike, my Honda 8HP 4-stroke is great.  It also has an alternator built in so I run a cable to my batt. for the fish finder and it charges it as long as the motor is running.  Mine is over 12 years old and is still going very strong.  I would get a used Honda any day!  In fact, I think I had seen one in the classified here not that long ago..."
509135,Billy Bob,2010-10-04 17:56:00,5865,"I would also seriously consider a 2 stroker for that small boat....not only weight wise (which is important) but also power wise....on my last fly-in trip to Ivanhoe the owner told me he sold all his 1 year old 4 stroker 9 hp Yammies and replaced them with 2 strokers because of all the complaints from clients that they were having planing out. AND you can save some money to boot.  GOOD LUCK,  Bob  BTW if you are near any fishing camps / cottages that replace their outboards every year or so maybe you can snag a nice deal."
509143,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-04 18:11:00,947,"2-Strokes are still good outboards.  But are becoming dinosaur motors.  Merc has stopped production back in 2009 for conventional 2-strokes they still make the opti cause it's compliant to California emissions.  Buying a 2 Stroke is like going back in time.  Pollution, noisy, Smokey mixing and carbon build up.  It is nice to be able to troll without raising your voice, smelling smoke and oil in the water.  Doing 1 oil change a year and straight gas fill up is a Plus in my Book.  Doesn't matter what brand you go with they are all great outboards.  Personal preference is what it comes down to GM, Dodge, Import etc..."
509150,scugpg,2010-10-04 18:53:00,1373,With how light the 4 strokes are becoming I wouldn't even consider a 2 stroke anymore.  I believe the smaller Mercury outboards are made by Tohatsu.
509291,craigdritchie,2010-10-05 02:16:00,1586,"Completely agree - unless you plan to load it in and out of float planes on a daily basis,  I would not even consider a two-stroke now. There's just no good reason to cling to 1950s technology any more."
