510169,digitalkreation,2010-10-07 21:46:00,25,"Hi all,  I'd like to try my hand at fishing the bays in and around Toronto on Lake ON.  Does anyone know of any free launches near some good spots?  I've only got a 14' Springbok, so I'll only want to venture out on the lake in calm waters and stick close to shore..  Thanks for any and all replies!  Mark"

510194,Dave Bailey,2010-10-07 22:58:00,1641,"Frenchman's Bay is one. Go south on West Shore Boulevard, when you get to the very end turn left. Keep going until you're driving on sand and you'll see a launch area on your left."

510304,Billy Bob,2010-10-08 11:16:00,5865, You need a special license to boat around harbor/islands in Toronto ? ? ?
510308,BITEME,2010-10-08 11:47:00,1968,  Yes it is true You can thank whoever it was that drilled the planes into the towers  Bite me
510323,Dave Bailey,2010-10-08 13:11:00,1641," I'm pretty sure it was required long before then. And if I recall correctly it only applies to powered vessels, canoes and such are okay."
510325,digitalkreation,2010-10-08 13:18:00,25,"Thanks everyone for the replies, I got a lot more than I thought I would, just like my last take at panfishing..  Question, what can I expect (other than Pike) to fish in a small boat close to shore on Lake ONT?"
