509896,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-07 02:34:00,70,"  This is a follow up discussion of the blue walleye from the topic posted by Randy from sturgeon!  Here is a picture of a three person limit ( 4 each ) from last year with 2 ""blues"" They are as good to eat as the regular ""yellows"" ! It's only pigments and mucous in their color... They're not really a blue walleye but are always a real eye catcher for fisherman who have never seen them ! But you can clearly see wich ones are the ""blue's"" and wich ones are the ""yellows"", you can almost say they're mutants lol ! I've seen many of these so called ""blue's""  in my life and have seen one up to 5lbs! Now thats a nice blue walleye!!"

510314,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-08 12:12:00,70,"It's not real ""blues"" they're regular walleye with messed up color pigments... and don't worry I do my fair share of catch and release!"
