Ended up weighing 21.36lbs on Day 1 and 20.22lbs on Day 2 and placed 2nd overall!  Not bad being that I've never been on the bay for bass!    Yesterday, I met up with one of my best friends from college who's down visiting from the Yukon.  We took the afternoon to fish Lake Simcoe for some smallies.  It wasnt a spectacular bite, but we managed to tangle with about 10 nice smallies, and even got a surprise walleye fishing the deeper water!  Great way to spend the day with an old friend!  "
509717,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-06 15:28:00,0,Very nice. Congrats on the win. And nice eye. Rumor has it that pickerel are being caught on a regular basis in Simcoe. You just have to know where.
509720,Joey,2010-10-06 15:36:00,9122,Congrats on 2nd and that is a nice pickerel  Joey
509721,TC1OZ,2010-10-06 15:38:00,987,"Awesome report. Congrats on placement, if you can't get 1st, 2nd is the next best  Those look like some real hogs man!"
509746,ld17,2010-10-06 17:28:00,319,I think something is wrong with your camera.  The background in the walleye pic is all blury!
509759,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-06 17:46:00,2690,"Nicely done, Steve!  Beauty ""pickereye"" as well!"
509766,jbailey,2010-10-06 17:55:00,866,dammnnn im jealous those smallies are gorgeous
509779,Rod Caster,2010-10-06 18:55:00,5784,"You must like that number 2 position! haha... I foresee 1st for you in the near future.  As soon as i saw ""surprise"" in the title I figured it was a walleye. Awesome catch Steve."
509980,steverowbotham,2010-10-07 12:55:00,1800," Ya wierd, it does that sometimes haha"
510016,ehg,2010-10-07 15:22:00,2666,"Another great report Steve! You really know that area.  Nice Simcoe walleye. My PB walleye(16 lbs) came from Simcoe ice around Beaverton,(15 yrs. ago) when the season was open until Mar 31 st. There are some brute walleyes in Simcoe, saw many coming off the ice in 15-20 lb. range. Football walleyes.. um 'pickies'."
510049,Leecher,2010-10-07 17:18:00,7832,Nice looking walleye Steve and congrats on your second place finish Leechman
510132,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-07 20:26:00,932,That's a gorgeous Eye Steve - I'm so used to these BIG bass from you that the Walter takes precedence
