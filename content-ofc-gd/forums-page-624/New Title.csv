502198,scugpg,2010-09-07 21:33:00,1373, 100% agree. I love my Nils.  I have the 4'' and think I'll get a 6 this year.
502210,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-07 22:47:00,2690, I second Geoff's question...where can you buy the Nils manual auger in southern Ontario?  Was doing a quick bit of research...reading many good things about them.
502224,scugpg,2010-09-07 23:35:00,1373, Call Jocelyn @ Angling Outfitters but call early...he usually sells out of them.
502227,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-07 23:41:00,2690,Beauty...Joc's store is a ten minute drive from my house!!!  I'll check it out.
502247,scugpg,2010-09-08 01:05:00,1373, I wish I was only 10mins from there....actually maybe its best I'm not LOL.

502260,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-08 01:26:00,2690,I'll PM you what they have or will have.
502271,mercman,2010-09-08 01:55:00,7054,"they got augers now !!! will wonders never cease...the last time i ice fished, my dad used an ice chipper and an axe. the constant battering of the axe never seemed to spook the fish, we got tons. augers.....wow, am i old or what."
502274,GBW,2010-09-08 02:10:00,8460,"Great, thanks!"
502328,Jer,2010-09-08 12:52:00,1426,"We fished Kawarthas last year with nothing but a hand auger, which was fine until the ice kept getting thicker and thicker and thicker. We even adapted a power drill to the auger with limited success.  A gas auger is on the Christmas list for this year."
502341,adempsey,2010-09-08 14:11:00,1498,"I think it would depend on a] do you walk on the ice, b] how far do you walk and c) how much gear do you have on your sled?  I walk out.  Sometimes the walk is a lot longer than I would like - last year on Simcoe is a case in point, the whitefish/trout seemed to be much further out compared to the previous seasons.  The 2km walk is more than enough for me and I wouldn't want the extra weight of a gas auger to deal with as well.  I don't have a pop-up hut for the same reason.  I currently use a 6"" manual auger, but prefer the 8""-10"" holes.   The 6"" is great for finding fish and has worked fine for me, but I often use my buddies 8"" manual auger.   Part of the reason is I share the hole with my flasher, so a larger hole makes it easier.  Connecting two holes with a saw isn't a bad alternative though, but I prefer to keep the holes under 12"" for safety reasons.  Anyway, if I didn't have too far to walk [or I had an ATV/sled] I'd consider a gas auger.  I'd also go for the 10"".  Good luck!"
502352,Fisherman,2010-09-08 14:51:00,7201,"The older you get the more the gas version is appreciated.  4-6 inches of ice, okay, I'll still hand crank, beyond that fergedaboutdit, Jiffy 30 does the job. 20 years old and still running without any problems."
502354,ckrb2007,2010-09-08 14:58:00,449,"As some of the other members have mentioned, it's all about have often you ice fish and how many holes you plan on drilling. I have a manual one for early ice and a gas auger for anything after. Living in Barrie I ice fish as much a possible (3-4 times per week) and I like to move around a lot so for me, a gas auger is a must, especially late in the season when the ice is 30""++. Keep your eye open for deals. I picked up an 8"" Jiffy a few years back at Walmart in the clearance section for $175.00. If there was more there, I would've bought 'em all!!! LOL  Good luck!"
502361,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-08 15:33:00,2690,"Thanks for all the input, everyone!!  Great that an ice fishing question can generate this kind of response in September! I'm leaning towards the manual for this year, either a Nils or Finnbore.  Although Lloyd (Fishhunter) has said he'll be dancing around me drilling holes with his gas auger, first the machete, now that...have to keep him away from those sharp objects"
502366,tknohpy,2010-09-08 15:49:00,162,"Hey Frankie65  I am in the market as well, thanks for starting a great thread!"
510354,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 15:00:00,2690,"Dug out this post again.  I spoke with Jocelyn at my local tackle shop...he only has the 4 1/2"" Nils in stock.  Fine for perch, smaller fish...no way on Quinte or Simcoe.  He also says that Nils can be a PITA to deal with so wasn't too interested in ordering more. Anywhere else that might have them??? If not I might just grab the Finn Bore...""Doc Sal"" and a few others recommended it.  Still a few months to go, but, time is flying!!"
510358,GBW,2010-10-08 15:14:00,8460,"Hey Frankie, I had an 8"" Strikemaster and didn't like it at all.  Now I have a 6"" Normark and it's good.  But if you can get one with curved blades like the Eskimo units get it.  They go through the ice like a hot knife in butter."
510369,fishnsled,2010-10-08 15:42:00,3520,"I've been happy with my Eskimo 8"" auger.  Had it for about 14 years and still going strong.  Only thing I've done to it is put in a spark plug and a new gas cap."
502066,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-07 14:30:00,2690,"So, here we are with a few great months of open water fishing to go.  Not to mention some great steelheading in November/December.  However, for some perverse reason, I'm thinking hard water fishing...probably due to Ryan's photos of him and his daughter in the hut. My question for all the hard core ice anglers out there is do I go with my original intention of buying a manual 8"" auger, or is power the way to go.  Keep in mind I don't have an ATV or snowmobile, so I am the ""pack-horse"" pulling the equipment out on the ice.  Thanks!!"
502071,Governator,2010-09-07 14:46:00,879,"I don't own a power auger, but the additional weight of 25-35lbs (I'm guessing) is just too much for me to haul around by foot.  I use a 6"" manual as it's less ice to go through than 8"" so it's quicker and more importantly easier on the arms."
502073,cwpowell,2010-09-07 14:48:00,265,"It all comes down to money in the end right. And how often you get out ice fishing. Personally I don't do enough ice fishign to warrant a gas auger, but if you do check out home depot, they always sell of their used tool rental ones fairly cheap."
502075,BillM,2010-09-07 14:54:00,17367,"I use both..  Early season it's the manual auger, mid/late season when I'm driving the truck out 8-9 miles it's the power auger."
502078,fishhunter,2010-09-07 15:00:00,604,"MANUAL 8"" TO START THEN GAS ALL THE WAY AFTER THAT 10"" HOLES. BIG LAKERS LIKE BIG HOLES"
502079,MJL,2010-09-07 15:06:00,2427,I just got into ice fishing this past winter almost exclusively on lake Simcoe for lakers.  I don’t have an ATV or snowmobile either.  I can’t imagine walking the distances we walked on the ice with a gas powered auger (Anywhere from 4-7km in total per trip depending on how the action and snow was).  I picked up an 8” Finbore III and it was way easier to cut holes than any other manual auger I’ve tried.  I prefer getting both hands cranking VS 1 single one.  It takes me about 20-30 seconds to cut a hole through 2ft of ice…It takes most people about 10 or less with the same auger
502080,fish-miester,2010-09-07 15:06:00,864,CWpowell said it. its all about time and money... and well how stuburn you are (how many holes are you going to punch) I say to myself im going to punch only 2 or 3 a spot.. but on some lakes like kawarthas you will punch a hole to find out its all weeds.. or no weeds then you go on to try a new hole and a new one after that and so on.. it can get tiring (thats where you would want a power auger)  personally I use a 6'' or 8'' hand auger and well it does the job. the thing to keep in mind tho is you have to constantly sharpen the blades or else you'll be sore!  also different sized holes/blades for different species.. if your going to just go for pan fish.. 4-6''.. walleye 6''.. walleye/pike/lakers/whities.. 6-8-10''
502081,buick14,2010-09-07 15:10:00,741,"Get yourself a Nils Master Manual Auger, and buy an extra blade in the event you tune it on the ice best quickest lightest there is..those Fin's were onto something...but very $$$"
502084,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-07 15:16:00,0,"i second the finn bore if you go the route of the manual but where a 6 inch is a breeze to cut holes, an 8 can be a devil, especially ""run n gun"" laker fishing."
502092,Fang,2010-09-07 16:07:00,1330,"I carry a 6"" normark with new blades every year. If they ain't sharp they don't cut!!! I also now carry a 32"" demolition hand saw with me. I picked up this beast for $20 at CTC and it goes through ice like butter. Drill 2 6"" holes side by side and zip out the ice between with the hand saw. Did it a couple times last year and it works out fine when you need the larger hole for lakers, walleye.  Just for the record I pulled an 18lb laker through that 6"" hole a few years ago. It was snug but doable.  After a few years cutting with a manual 8"" auger I'll never pick up another one. I can blast through a 6"" hole 3 times faster with sharp 6"". It amazing how that extra 2"" on the auger adds to the effort required."
502093,sauce,2010-09-07 16:07:00,219,Gas augers are nice. And there's times that you absolutely need one. But for all around fishing a 6 or 8 manual is all you need. Don't lend your auger to strangers or people that are clumsy. Its very easy to damage the blades. A new set that is well taken care of should cut through hundreds of inches without too much effort. One little knick in the blade and you'll be cursing. Some people say you can sharpen them others say its a waste of time. I've never tried. Just take care of the blades and replace them every 2-3 seasons. You'll know when its time.
502099,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-07 16:21:00,2690,"Thanks for all the responses, so far, guys. I'm gathering from what I've read that the manual is the way to go for me...perhaps a 6"" for walleye/perch/panfish, AND, an 8"" for those Simcoe lakers.  Now if I could catch one as big as Lloyd did, for anyone who hasn't seen the video it was MASSIVE, I'd have to get the sled and a 10""er"
502102,vinnimon,2010-09-07 16:28:00,2593,"Ive always used a manual auger,but cutting holes all day is tiresome.I purchased a power auger a few years back,glad I did!As a few mentioned a nik in the blade,or lending it out to a newbee,it becomes  a pain in the rear!

502122,capt bruce,2010-09-07 17:14:00,820,"IM an old guy so its gas for me now , but I think the niose it makes , slows down my fishing as it takes almost an hour before things calm down after punching a few holes , most of my ice time is spent on the bog and the noise my augger makes in the shallow water must scare every thing in a kilo radius ,might not be so bad in deep lake trout water on simcoe , but like I said Im old and even tho a good manual will cut ice like butter , only have so many turns in these poor shoulders left ."
502158,Burtess,2010-09-07 18:30:00,901," The difference in ice between a 6"" (28.26 sq.inch) and an 8"" (50.24 sq. inch) hole is 78% more for the 8""!!!!  That is why it is so much more effort to cut over the 6"".  Burt"
502160,Bondar,2010-09-07 18:40:00,817,I'd get a Manual auger and take the extra you save from the gas auger and buy yourself a portable Graph or flasher !!

Then I made 2 open end boxes for my power auger Strikemaster 4 stroke lightest available. Adjust the boxes so there is some pressure from bungee cords. Add fairly long ropes that are also for safety. Hauled 2 different people out over the years that weren't getting out. And you have all that exacter room for rest of stuff. Caring sucks.
