509600,Terry,2010-10-06 00:25:00,14456,great report  I guess I missed this one while I was on vacation
509627,Joey,2010-10-06 01:53:00,9122,"  HAHAHAHA, yep, that was one fine meal Wayne.  I don't think I could duplicate it either.  Either way, that last, poor, lonely chicken sure was mighty tasty!!!  As for the no lips - now THAT is funny  Can't wait for your pics Wayne.  Joey"
509701,Rod Caster,2010-10-06 13:46:00,5784,"Great photography. That baby gar shot is stunning, as is the egret shot. You got good eyes!"
509919,irishfield,2010-10-07 03:10:00,26272,"Paul... we do have them well trained though, don't we! "
509928,splashhopper,2010-10-07 03:31:00,2931,great pics... are u sure you are not the sales and marketing manager for that outfit though
509938,Tybo,2010-10-07 04:32:00,1373, I's think it had something to do with the chicken!
490390,Joey,2010-08-02 00:29:00,9122,"We had the pleasure of being invited up to Wayne and Leah's cottage, so we decided to do a half & half Temagami/Lakair week.  We headed up to Temagami on Saturday the 24th and after a bit of a ""which launch are we meeting at"" we found Wayne and Leah     They helped us unload and take all our gear over on the boats to their glorious island cottage.    We're obviously at the right place    It was a nice little work out every day from deck to water    This was our typical scene of relaxation and good conversation.      Every morning at 8:00 a.m. sharp, this plane took off, and then proceeded to land and take off about every hour for the rest of the day.    We wondered to ourselves who made the mould for this nose    This cute little Merganser duck was sunning itself on the first morning before we headed out for some lakers.    There's that plane landing again.  Thought this pic turned out pretty cool.    Some crazy man down near the water!!    A beautiful dragonfly out sunning itself.    This rock was weird, the only rock with this moss growing on it.  Leah said she scraped the moss off just to see what would happen, and it grew back just the same.    Our wonderful hostess with the mostest!!    We fished for two days and only had one laker on.  Paul thought he was salmon fishing and set the hook, and we're sure ripped the lips right off the fish     Needless to say, no fish was there when he reeled in.    The scenery was just fantastic up there.      Bear with me here, I was trying to get the hang of my new camera, which was not an easy task since I had left the manual at home.   I tried to get some action shots and others so I'll post them just for fun.    This was a mid-air bird fight and I wish it had of been in focus, oh well, I'll get it soon enough.    Just out trolling!    Tuesday and Wednesday were hot, but way too windy to downrig in Wayne's huge boat, so us gals decided swimming was in order.            We ate well and had Blackened Chiiiicken Tuesday night.        Some more camera playing.         So Wednesday rolled around and we were sad to go.  We had such a good time, but since it was windy again we decided it was the best day to make our drive to Lakair.  We can't thank you enough Wayne and Leah.  We had just a super time.  Joey & Paul   con't.........."
490391,Joey,2010-08-02 00:29:00,9122,"Soooooo, off to Lakair, which meant driving right past TJ's house.  But alas, he was up at camp Jiggy Jiggy.    We unpacked and settled into our cabin.  Paul was ready for the bugs and I was just happy to be unpacked again      I ended up catching two eater pickerel, but was busy taking scenery shots and then forgot to take a pic of the fish            The eagle was just a bit too far out of my camera range, but I tried.    Sitting at our picnic table, a family brought down their spaniel to jump off the dock and fetch a stick.  I took an action shot of him jumping, then a few of him shaking the water off.  Turned out pretty cool.          A nice Lily.    Honest, it was this big    I was looking around for stuff to take a pic of while Paul yacked, and noticed this baby Gar in the water.      Of course I had to try the self-timer!!!      Random shots.        So, all tolled, we caught one pike each, and I got two pickerel.  Here is one of the pike - sheesh!!  Water was silty and stained and very low.  6"" lower than June.              So the highlight of the trip to Lakair was my chance to see and get pictures of this Great White Egret.  What a beautiful bird.  Took my breath away.                   And one final Photo    It was a great week off and the weather was nice for the most part.  Great food and awesome company more than made up for the bad fishing.  Cheers and thanks for your patience with my photography learning and playing.  Joey"
490401,danbouck,2010-08-02 01:29:00,4380,"Awesome report, I'm happy that I'm not the only one with mostly scenery shots  Too windy for Wayne's boat   I'm hoping to visit him early September"
490413,Joey,2010-08-02 03:32:00,9122,"You'll have a blast Dan.  With the wind and his boat, its more of a boat control with the downriggers problem.  No matter, it was nice just sitting chatting.  Joey"
490417,walleyemaster,2010-08-02 04:16:00,325,excelent report joey looks like you had a great time..awsome picyures will keep you in mind when i need a camera crew..lol
490423,Bly,2010-08-02 05:39:00,1556,Beautiful pictures Joey!   You are getting very good with your new camera.  Sounds like you had a wonderful time
490427,SlowPoke,2010-08-02 06:49:00,2984,"Great report and some really cool pictures! You guys should have maxxed out your motor, it seems the fish are outrunning you!"
490431,lew,2010-08-02 09:51:00,12766,Sounds like fun times Joey and your definetely getting the hang of the new camera. Was the eagle picture taken over at Aikenheads where we saw him a couple years ago ?? He was there again last month.  We're heading back up again in 2 weeks but staying at Memquisit this time and I was hoping the water levels had come up since last month but no such luck from your report.
490434,Roy,2010-08-02 11:34:00,13728,"Great report as usual, Joey! Wish I could have joined you for a day at Lakair but it wasn't in the cards. You have some great shots in there. I'm really glad you both had a relaxing holiday."
490440,corvette1,2010-08-02 12:09:00,1765,awesome trip joey looks like everyone had a great time
490449,solopaddler,2010-08-02 13:00:00,8605,"Thanks for posting that Joey, looks like a great time."
490451,Joey,2010-08-02 13:18:00,9122," Yes Lew, he was at Aikenheads, but he was really high up soaring.  I wasn't even sure it was the eagle until I zoomed in, but even with my zoom lens, he was very far away so the pic is still blurry.  Didn't even get a sniff from a pike in that bay.  There are lots of weeds tho, just zero visabiity.  Yes, the water is very low and we did hit a rock right off the get go   .    As Kevin said, pretend its a whole new lake that you have to learn because it has all changed.  There are even rocks he didn't know existed.  Good luck up there, the big gals should be good and hungry by then    Thanks everyone for the nice remarks on my photos, but its still a learning process.  Maybe Santa will be good and get me a bird watching telephoto lens"
490462,John,2010-08-02 13:41:00,2956,"Great report Joey, awesome photo's."
490665,lew,2010-08-02 23:13:00,12766," Thanks for the up-date Joey and good to hear the weeds are filling in as they were very sparse a month ago, so things should be good in a couple weeks."
490674,Squid,2010-08-02 23:32:00,1656,Great company and awesome pics Joey!!
490726,fishhunter,2010-08-03 01:52:00,604,great report and pics!! I Love spending time at his cottage.
490776,Rich Clemens,2010-08-03 10:10:00,3131,"Great report guys.  From the looks of it though, it doesn't seem all too disappointing that the fish weren't cooperating.  A lot of fun with good friends."
490899,TJQ,2010-08-03 17:46:00,7806,Awesome report Joey.. sorry we missed you!!
490912,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-03 18:10:00,2690,"Some great shots, Joey, could have done without the one of Wayne's butt leaning over the bbq  !!"
490967,AzuluSpookd,2010-08-03 20:46:00,348,"Nice report Joey, thanks for the pics. That dog just looks like a big meanie! What a glare he has...  Wayne certainly looks like he's in his happy place!"

Blackened... my specialty... but having a real problem duplicating that wonderful meal on the new BBQ !! lol  I don't even know where my camera is... but I'll get around to adding to your thread Joey!  Oh... BTW Paul, we were out fishing on the 30th and snagged a Laker in the side of the head... he couldn't bite the hook as he had no LIPS !"
509596,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-06 00:18:00,2690, IT'S ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
