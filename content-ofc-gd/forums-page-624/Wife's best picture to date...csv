510376,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 16:18:00,2690," With fishing that good, I'd take him up on it Terry!!!!  What's a few bugs in the teeth?  LOL!!"
510380,irishfield,2010-10-08 16:21:00,26272,"LOL.. Terry was asked first, but something about a ""Swivel Servant"" not being able to book time off for the first time in 10 years...."
510386,Terry,2010-10-08 16:43:00,14456,"yeah a few more days notice and I might have been able to get the time off  they cut the staff by so many there is no one to cover thedays off , so now only one of us can book off any days so the early bird gets the worm.......I already book off for the BOQ trip and was the first for those days, so I.m good to go"
510401,fishhunter,2010-10-08 18:04:00,604,WELL TERRY IM HAPPY YOU HAD TO WORK I ENJOYED MYSELF!!!! WHAT WAS GOOD WE THOUGHT OF YOU EVERYTIME WE HOOKED A FISH LOL
510406,Terry,2010-10-08 18:17:00,14456,so it worked out the same as if I was there  you guys catch the fish and yell out I'm not Terry
510424,Leecher,2010-10-08 19:00:00,7832,Excellent pic Wayne Sounds like a riot on the back lakes Looking forward to the full report of your summer Thanks for the sneak peek!!! Leechman
510441,misfish,2010-10-08 19:40:00,29133,"Great shot Leah.  Man thats a payload on the front of that canoe eh? Oh wait,it was balance out at the stern.LOL  Thanks for sharing Wayne."
510248,irishfield,2010-10-08 01:19:00,26272,"Just starting to go thru the 500 pictures we took, in the last 3 months, and the 18 videos I shot in 1080 HD. Here's Leah's best shot that I can remember in a long time. Lloyd and I taking off during fog lift for a back lake never to be disclosed.    .. oh and are you having fun yet Lloyd??? There's one... got it !! There's one.. got it!    Over 100 lakers per day..  Water clarity (see down over 35 feet) and colour is just amazing on this lake.    Hopefully I can find some time in the next month to put together a proper report for the summer."
510252,Pigeontroller,2010-10-08 01:25:00,2793,I gotta ask Wayne...Wouldn't the boat be more aerodynamic with the bow facing forward?
510253,smally21,2010-10-08 01:26:00,993,what is the name of the lake?  just kidding great pics.  1080HD videos are outrageous. play them on the right tv i couldn't beleive the picture quality.  it must be awesome to lake hop like you do.
510254,irishfield,2010-10-08 01:28:00,26272,Definitely not Dax. Same reason a wing is blunt at the front and tapered at the back (it creates lift that way). The other reason is smooth airflow off the rear of the canoe. If you had the flat end back there it would blank airflow over the stabilizer and nobody would like that last ride.
510255,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-08 01:31:00,957,Nice shot for sure.  Makes me wish I were up yonder right now.
510264,The JAY,2010-10-08 01:58:00,239,"Wow, that's a nice pic of the plane taking off, and the water color is amazing... I'd love to know where 100 lakers a day is possible! Thanks for sharing.  Ps. Does it make me a geek that I understand the physics behind the Bernoulli effect Irish is talking about? Yeah, I thought so..."
510268,irishfield,2010-10-08 02:13:00,26272,Thanks.. and I'll add that it's not a stocked lake either! Flesh is this beautiful colour and the taste is the best I've ever had in my life. Pickeral can step aside for these ones!  
510270,Twocoda,2010-10-08 02:17:00,4130, yep it does Jay ...but it s a geeks world...yep ....its a geeks world ...otherwise i wouldn't be communicating to this question through my telphone without cables ....  beem me up now Scotty!   nice shootin on the fish Irish
510274,Joey,2010-10-08 02:23:00,9122,"Wow, that really is a good photo that Leah took Wayne  Joey"
510275,irishfield,2010-10-08 02:25:00,26272,"It came out pretty clear for her, that's for sure. Her still shots are generally blurry and we were doing about 45 MPH there at lift off."
510279,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 02:33:00,2690,"Nice Wayne!!  Looking forward to hearing the story from Lloyd on Sunday. He was just a LITTLE EXCITED when he got back and updated his status, LOL!!!"
510287,danc,2010-10-08 03:03:00,4677," That's it? I took over 1200 last weekend. Seriously. Besides all that, it's great to have you back Wayne.  And that's an awesome shot by Leah."
510295,Terry,2010-10-08 09:09:00,14456, you're killing me  some real nice pictures there
510305,fishhunter,2010-10-08 11:25:00,604,I LOVE THAT LAKE!!!
510307,blaque,2010-10-08 11:44:00,2419,"I too cant believe you can just strap a boat to the outside of an airplane and it doesnt effect anytyhing LOL  That amazes me........i thought every corner, rivet, taper etc......was critical for aerodynamics to get a plane in the air and keep it there.  Its why Im not a pilot I'd imagine lol"
510318,Headhunter,2010-10-08 12:34:00,5703,"Nice shot Wayne! And I see from the other pic, that you got Lloyd's good side! LMAO HH"
510322,johnnyb,2010-10-08 13:06:00,3413,FINALLY some pics!!  Pristine back lakes brimming with trout....you really know how to do it up...can't wait for the full installment
510336,bigbuck,2010-10-08 13:53:00,2449,Nice Pic!! Nice laker fillets too!! I'll bet they were pretty tasty!! Nice to have you back Wayne. Maybe I'll see you out on the water this weekend. We'll be cruising around tomorrow on the 'Bay.
510339,tb4me,2010-10-08 13:55:00,3295,That is one cool pic Irish. I didnt notice the boat the first time I looked. Must be nice to lake hop like that. Can you by any chance adopt me and let me and my family move in with you and yours? Ill be your new fishin buddie!! lol Awesome and thanks for sharing
510349,Rod Caster,2010-10-08 14:15:00,5784,What beautiful meat on those Trouts!!! Looks SOOO clean and fresh.
510366,Terry,2010-10-08 15:34:00,14456,I hear he straps Lloyd to the outside of the plane too  to balance the boat   LOL
510367,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 15:38:00,2690,
