I work on my own and work has been very slow for the past 3 months.3 weeks ago my wife (who has worked for 20 years at Sears Barrie) went to the doctor. She was told she had pneumonia and with a doctors note was told to stay home for a few days. After 3 days she went back to work fearing she would get in trouble. 2 weeks later a week ago last Sunday she did her day shift. She came home at 6 30. At 9 pm my son and I rushed her to the hospital, very cold pale and low pulse. After testing to see if she had a mild heart attack, they ruled it back to pneumonia. She was told to stay off work for 3 to 4 days. She had a doctor note. She was off 3 days only.  She went back on the Friday. 2 of these days during the week were her normal days off. Wednesday of this week she was wrote up for missing to much time. SHE IS FULL TIME AND THEY HAVE MADE HER WORK 7 WEEKENDS IN A ROW. She was in tears and coming down Bayfield she stopped for a red light. The car ahead of her and my wife being behind were both going to make a right turn. About 30 feet down the side street some headbanging punk runs out in front of the car ahead. She swerved to avoid him and my wife caught the back left bumber of the car ahead. It just scraped the bumper.  Now we have to come up with the 500 deductable. MY 15 year old paid for my wifes prescription out of his grass cutting money.  NEITHER one of us have ever collected UI or any other assistance. If any one can help please contact"" Monika Zajkowski of Co Operators Yonge St Barrie 728 3545.  At the very least thanks for reading this, it helps to take away some of the frustration. You would think that after spending 6 years in the military Sears would treat their staff with a little compassion."
