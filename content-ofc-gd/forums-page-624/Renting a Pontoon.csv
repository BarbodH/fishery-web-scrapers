509815,EC1,2010-10-06 22:08:00,930,"Good Afternoon all, I was just wondering if anyone knows where it's still possible to rent a pontoon for a day? The preferred locations would be in the Kawartha's and maybe I'll even be willing to drive out to the Rideau Waterways.  I can't do smaller boats as I need to take about 4 - 5 people total onto the same boat, as I'm the only one with a boaters license. And am I looking at fully booked rentals at this time of year, or should there be some rentals available just walking in without advanced notice?  Thanks in Advance !"
509819,ADB,2010-10-06 22:30:00,444," Plank Road Marina on Rice rents pontoons: http://www.plankroadcottages.com/  They shouldn't be booked at all.  I would just give them a call a few days beforehand.  Plus, I think they have two pontoons."
509821,SBCregal,2010-10-06 22:31:00,688,you don't need a boaters license to drive a rental boat from what i understand.
509823,Tom McCutcheon,2010-10-06 22:35:00,627,You could try Happy Days Houseboats. They are located just south of Bobcaygeon on the west side of Pigeon Lake. I think they rent pontoon boats as well as houseboats.  www.happydayshouseboats.com  Tom.

509848,EC1,2010-10-07 00:02:00,930,"Thanks for the help guys. We're pretty set on it being an entire family thing, I think I should have mentioned this would be a fishing trip  Might not go all the way to brockville, as I was thinking of somewhere as far as being along highway 15 and 30k's within the 401. Will look at the Rice lake spot, I'll tell you guys how it ends up going."
