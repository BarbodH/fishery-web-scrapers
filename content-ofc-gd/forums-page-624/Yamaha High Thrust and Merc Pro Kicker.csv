However, I want more power to push my boat faster. Current speed is 4.5~5 Mph under this T8. I plan to upgrade to Merc pro-kicker 9.9 HP. Wonder if it can improve alot?"
509754,irishfield,2010-10-06 17:37:00,26272,"It won't improve top speed at all... 4.5 to 5 mph is ""Hull speed"" for the boat. If the motor doesn't have the power to put it on plane.. that is the best it's going to do."
509792,capt bruce,2010-10-06 20:05:00,820,What Irish said . want more speed get a twenty than maybe you can get the boat to plane .
509801,linweir,2010-10-06 20:53:00,202,Txs guys. I think I may trade in another 15 HP yammy instead.
