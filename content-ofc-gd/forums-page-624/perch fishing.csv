509540,SBCregal,2010-10-05 21:41:00,688,"hey all,  I was out fishing the barrie waterfront this past weekend and caught quite a few perch and we were planning on going back again this weekend coming in hopes of getting enough decent ones for a feed.  sizes we were getting was maybe 8-9"" which seems too small to keep for me.  the guys next to us were getting larger ones, i think its because they were setup differently and were able to cast further out, i'll try this setup this weekend.  all that being said, what do YOU consider a keeper perch???  ryan"
509541,danbouck,2010-10-05 21:43:00,4380,IMO the best tasting perch are between 8 and 10 inches.
509545,bigugli,2010-10-05 21:50:00,6138,"8"" and up is the general rule of thumb for panfish. Maybe 7""+ for sunfish."
509548,GBW,2010-10-05 21:52:00,8460,"way to kick him while he's down Dan, LOL.  9.5"" and up here but if I only have 3 or 4 in that size in the livewell back they go."
509551,perchslayer666,2010-10-05 21:57:00,280,12-14 inchers - Good thick fillets.  Big Perch = Big Fillets = Less cleaning.  Go deep for the Big Uns'
509554,misfish,2010-10-05 22:02:00,29133,"My youngest has been doing very well off the break wall.  His bait of choice,shrimp.Yep.He bought a shrimp ring, he,s getting the 10-12 inchers.  Casting out and slowly dragging it back to him on the bottom.    Oh,his shrimp ring has lasted him almost 3 weeks now.Heck,it would last 30 seconds in my hands.Im going to have to go with him just to eat."
509556,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-05 22:02:00,2582,I perch fish alot so I can be pretty selective. IMHO anything under 10 inches doesn't warrant keeping it because they just have very little meat. A 10 inch perch will have double the meat of a 8.5 inch perch. I also release anything over 12 inches. Some people feel the size matters with regards to taste. Personally I have never found this to be true.  Like I said I get out alot. If you only have the chance to sneak out a couple of times by all means keep whatever you are comfortable keeping and enjoy the fish fry.
509563,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-05 22:25:00,2690,"When out at Long Point usually 9"" minimum for me.  Smaller lakes, I'd say 8"" and up."
509570,Fisherman,2010-10-05 22:49:00,7201,"Brian with a one track mind...food..starvin.. Those shrimp do work,  was there Sat and Mon morning for a bit, two young guys at Tiffin were having some luck."
509574,SBCregal,2010-10-05 23:01:00,688,thanks guys.  hopefully i'll get enough keepers for a nice feed.  i'll be sure to report if i get anything
509591,ctranter,2010-10-06 00:11:00,543,"I know people that keep almost any size perch, but they are such a pain in the arse to clean, I don't know how they do it.  I only keep 10-12""+, not because of taste, but because anything smaller is annoying to clean."
509683,oldphart,2010-10-06 12:40:00,665,"~~~I out most weekends from Sept. to Nov. after Perch keeping only enough for supper. I like them over 10"", and only using spoons or small jigs."
509695,ch312,2010-10-06 13:37:00,1590,"9""+ unless they are gut hooked. i have noticed no difference in taste between 8"" and 14"" fish and i have ate perch literally every week this year since april. it takes about 1 minute with an electric fillet knife to get boneless/skinless fillets.  best rig so far this year for the bigger fish has been a drop shot rig.  ultra light rod/reel 8 lb power pro 3ft, 4 lb floro leader 2 hooks...one red other chartreuse 1 oz bell sinker"
