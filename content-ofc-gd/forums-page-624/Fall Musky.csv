509293,baironhorse,2010-10-05 02:25:00,145,"Ive read a few post and trying to gather some data...Im not looking for spots but rather your advice on technique, lure selection and what parts of water to fish for musky at this time of the year....In nut shell what advice can you give?"
509305,GBW,2010-10-05 02:50:00,8460,"where are you going or want to go and fish?  what type of gear do you have?  are you a regular musky angler with all the tools to catch, release in a safe for you (and fish) manner?  I honestly think your post is going to sink to the bottom without any details..."
509313,tonka-toy,2010-10-05 03:30:00,139,musky hunter and The next bite web-sites both have article sections with good reads on the subject.
509314,baironhorse,2010-10-05 03:33:00,145,"OK...I have caught decent size pike in past...but never a decent size muskie....Heading to Balsam and Canal Lake...In terms of tackle I have larger bomber a, husky jerks and rouges...have access to a cradle and a couple of suwicks (not sure on spelling)...couple of buck tail spinners..braided line...steel leader and a couple of heavy action rods...juts basic stuff..not really a muskie fisherman but I thought I would try my luck...hope this helps..thanks "
509319,GBW,2010-10-05 04:07:00,8460,"first off, bolt cutters are a must for you and the fish.  Then the net, rod, reel and line.  As for rod, reel and line (not incl. leader) go heavy and or/strong stuff.   Reel, same.  Rod, somening that you can 'horse' the fish in with fast so you don't kill it due to a fight time that was too long (ie, a musky on a bad rod isn't a good thing).  play safe and good luck..."
509321,tonka-toy,2010-10-05 04:11:00,139,"I know a few guys who do well for pike on canal,only ever fished Balsam a few times as a kid.I used to fish Scugog and Pigeon alot for musky.We had a blast trolling believers on short lines ,very fast.Good numbers,really exiting."
509344,ehg,2010-10-05 11:51:00,2666,Canal Lake has only pike now. Balsam Lake and Kawartha lakes eastward have good musky fishing. Try a jointed perch pattern bait like a J-13 or larger. Make sure you have proper equipment for landing and releasing and have a good time.
509614,baironhorse,2010-10-06 01:04:00,145,"I typically don't fish muskie or have ""muskie"" gear...I just want to try and see as I have couple of old heavy action ugly sticks lying around and I figured I will give it a shoot in between some bass fishing... I guess my best luck would be trolling 10- 20 ft close to shoreline? What do you guys think"
