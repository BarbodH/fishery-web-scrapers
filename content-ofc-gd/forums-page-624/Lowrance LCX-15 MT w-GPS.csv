509718,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-06 15:28:00,957,"I'm perfectly happy with my Lowrance LCX-15 MT w/GPS, but I also realize that happy and dumb often go together.  It's still doing the job for me, but I'm wondering if I need to begin convincing myself to upgrade.  It was a bargain purchase for me in early 2005 and was my first sonar that told me the truth."
509719,Terry,2010-10-06 15:32:00,14456,"I have new units hds5, but I would never part with my x15 and it's still on my boat  it is just the best fishfinder ever made, IMHO"
509724,Pigeontroller,2010-10-06 16:07:00,2793,Colour is nice!
509726,Whopper,2010-10-06 16:13:00,2174,I have dibs if you upgrade
509729,Roy,2010-10-06 16:28:00,13728,"Connie, I wanted Marc Thorpe's LCX 15 once he'd finished the season some years ago and someone else jumped in in front of me. I was disappointed because it truly is a great unit. The following year or the one after that, his LCX 25C became available and I jumped on it. I'm very happy with it cause yes, colour is nice but I'd still be very happy with the 15. To this day, as many say, it continues to be one of the best units out there."
509742,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-06 17:17:00,957,"A couple of years ago I passed up a deal for about $250 or so, including the GPS antenna.  There were just a few new units, offered by Cabela's.  I took a night to think about it and they were gobbled up by the next morning when I attempted to order."
509774,Raf,2010-10-06 18:37:00,3495,"Hold on to that X-15 Connie, it's a great unit.  We've run it on JPs boat for years -- it has now been moved up to the bow but it still works great.  Dibs after Phil.."

509961,fishhunter,2010-10-07 11:40:00,604,I HAVE TWO AND WOULD NOT GIVE THEM UP. NEW IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER.
