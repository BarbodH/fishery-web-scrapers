509827,aplumma,2010-10-06 23:05:00,6896,Well the Saturday 2 weeks ago I had a squeal from under the big boat coming from the running gear. I brought it to the mechanic hoping it was just a piece of rope in the drive train on one motor. They craned the boat out and started to tear into the problem and found both the port and starboard drive shaft Carriage bearing were seized up and needed to be replaced. The estimate was given and the work begins. I get the expected phone call after 2 days and more bad news one of the drive shafts was wedged in tight to the bearings and had machined a groove in the 1.50 inch drive shaft and was not coming out. A new estimate was furnished to heat and beat the old unit out and send it to a machine shop for rebuilding and truing of the shafts. Well fast forward 10 days and they resplashed the boat and I went and paid them for their kindness....I ran the boat back to the slip and it is working like a champ. The Velvet drives slide into gear without a noise and it only drops 50 rpms from neutral to in gear. So its tile to get fishin again just in time for the big Cats to start the winter feed.   Art

509834,aplumma,2010-10-06 23:23:00,6896,We would have done it in our younger days but....after seeing the effort it took to do the job I am glad we got old.   Art
