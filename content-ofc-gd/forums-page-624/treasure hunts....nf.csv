509736,smally21,2010-10-06 16:59:00,993,"i spend alot of time at home with the kids.  an interesting part of each day are the 'treasure hunts' - you know, all 4 pairs of kids shoes are in my wifes car, the sunscreen found its way into the liquor cabinet? etc.  so to keep our sanity around the place i pretend these frustrating last minute searches are treasure hunts and get the kids on it.  here is the latest, i had to take a pic. went thru sons sock drawer 5 minutes before school.....    almost defies logic, not a pair in the bunch.im sure we've all been there. carry on."
509739,Roy,2010-10-06 17:11:00,13728,"Those are my size! I like the grey and black just above the red one on the left. If you can find the match, I'll buy them."
509770,capt bruce,2010-10-06 18:17:00,820,"Smallie just do as I did when children were small and wife worked early leaveing me to the take to school chore , I just matched them up , darks and lights , two dark socks ie blue black etc. or two light ,whites greys etc. it worked for us .

509781,TC1OZ,2010-10-06 19:08:00,987,I don't feel so alone anymore! This is almost as good as a fishing report! hahahaa
509790,Joey,2010-10-06 19:44:00,9122,I thought everyone knew about the sock aliens.  They come down at night and steal one sock and them zoom back to their planet.  They've been around forever
509794,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-06 20:23:00,2582,Do you have a cat? Our old cat WAS the sock alien. Years of frustration blaming the kids and Debbe too... who does the laundry... for losing socks. Then we go to replace an old couch down stairs in the family room and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD we find the elephant graveyard of socks stuffed in under the couch where the cat used to sleep/hide alot.  The upside....I got enough work socks now to last me until I retire
509808,capt bruce,2010-10-06 21:17:00,820,"We have a cat maybe I should stake him out and get back all those socks . Want to know whats worse than socks , I ,my son and my daughter and wife play guitars and banjos etc.,pretty well anything that has strings , never could figger out things ya got to blow in , Every time Im near a music store I buy picks , two dozen at a time been doing this for years , must have bought well over 1,000 maybe over the years 10,000.

509814,mercman,2010-10-06 22:06:00,7054," i read about this in science weekly, scientists have discovered and outer band in the atmosphere full of little polyester and wool objects, they call it the hozone layer i think......."
510069,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-07 18:06:00,2582, Thx for that Capt Bruce...got a good chuckle out of that  :thumbsup_anim:
510090,Chance,2010-10-07 19:02:00,420,"Boy looking at all those little socks brings back memories.I am inthe same boat (pardon the pun)spending alot of time with the kids.It quickly progressed to pens,they either dissapear completely or someone mysteriously drains all the ink from them overnight"
510119,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-07 19:57:00,2582," Pens with no ink made me think... about something critically important I should pass on to parents with young kids, and I can't stress this enough.  Sit down with them as often as you can when they are still young and MIGHT listen...and impress upon then how vitally important it is to change the roll of toilet paper when it is finished.  Get the message across when they are still pottie training...it's your only hope."
