509786,Whitemikeca,2010-10-06 19:21:00,138,"I am heading up to Pigeon on Friday for some fall muskies but unfortunatly none of my regular fishing partners can make it.  I am still going to go up by myself but I would rather have a partner if possible.  If one of you is interested then PM me.  I would prefer someone who has experience with musky fishing, specifically how to handle the fish and preferably with their own muskie rod/reel.  I am coming from Toronto so I could also pick up if on the way.  PM me and we can discuss.  Hoping to have another successful outing like this past weekend. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=47561"

509851,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-07 00:25:00,0, Man you struck gold with Raf! Really knowledgeable Musky fisherman. I may be going musky fishing too Friday. That is if the doctor OK's it on Thursday. Looking forward to your report!

509997,Whitemikeca,2010-10-07 13:46:00,138, Nice!  I can't wait to get out on the water.  Looks like is should be some decent weather.  Hopefully we get a little cloud cover.
