509326,lew,2010-10-05 09:04:00,12766,"I went as far as phoning Mustang customer service in British Columbia yesterday afternoon and she said there are no suits made in shorter versions.  Seems strange that nobody makes them when so many folks are looking for them. Even the ladies extra small suit comes with a 29"" leg.   Terry, the 2 piece suit may be an option for me and with the amount of time you spend on the ice they must work well. Did you get the insulated bib pants to go with the jacket ??  And also, where did you buy your suit ??  Thanks everyone for your suggestions and my search will continue, and thanks for the offer on your old suit Garry."
509327,Terry,2010-10-05 09:13:00,14456,I got the jacket at CTC when they were on sale and the bib pants I got at royal distributing . and they are snowmobile pants insulated but not floater
509329,lew,2010-10-05 09:59:00,12766,"That sounds good Terry, I think I'll look into something like that. I've already got waterproof insulated pants but would prefer the bibs.  I was in CTC in P'Boro the other day and they didn't have any floater coats so I'll make a few phone calls today."

509336,lew,2010-10-05 11:07:00,12766,"Thanks for taking the time Roy, I haven't checked the HH suits  but I'll see if there's anything around here. I'll also call those 2 places on Lansdown but I think their more into jogging & running types of things.  I just had a look at LeB's website and they carry a couple different Mustang coats so it may be time for a drive.  I'm not into ice fishing but we fish the softwater right up until Dec. 15th"
509346,oldphart,2010-10-05 12:19:00,665,"~~~I'm 5'5"" with real short legs, to get the length I need I have to cut off almost 12"", and lose the warranty"
509349,Headhunter,2010-10-05 12:35:00,5703,"Hey Lew, Take a look, as some have mentioned, at buying a floater jacket and getting the bib pants separately. I have a Mustang Bomber jacket and Boy o Bouy bib pants... all were gotten from Cabella's... I use the jacket year round as my floatation and only use the pants during cold weather. You should be able to find pants that fit you. I really like the two piece system as it allows for free and easy movement and I don't find it cold in any way. According to the Mustang site, if memory doesn't fail me, the two piece system doesn't really limit the effectiveness of a one piece suit. HH"
509360,BITEME,2010-10-05 12:55:00,1968,"Morning Lew  I know you are big on life safety, the only recomendation I can give you is SALUS its a bit more money but in my opinion far superior to all out there. I have an odessey class it is fully adjustible for length of arm and leg it has built in weight support parts to prevent fulshing and is ventable and damn near bullet proof I have tried alot of suits and considering I like to fish alone alot I would trust my life with nothing less. If I had the money right now I would buy another and store it. Very comfortable to fish in. You may need to make a trip to Waterloo to size one up but its worth the trip to see where it is made.  Just my 2 cents  Peter"
509362,lew,2010-10-05 12:56:00,12766,"Thanks Joe, I think I've decided on a 2 piece as there's doesn't appear to be any one piece suits in the size I want."
509364,lew,2010-10-05 12:58:00,12766,"Thanks to you too Pete, we were posting at the same time."
509373,misfish,2010-10-05 13:36:00,29133, Lew  I stopped into the hook and bow here while I was out.They had a med and large. Asking 350.Looks like a pretty good suit.
509387,hirk,2010-10-05 14:14:00,571,"Lew check your PM's,I think you will be happy."
509491,Uncle Buck,2010-10-05 19:20:00,1000,"Mine fits surprisingly well, especially considering my petite frame...  here's my brother in my suit... he's 6'0, 220...    that's a 3xl... probably a tad big for ya Lew  i bought it in 05, when i was ""skinny"" then met my wife which added around 80lbs to me and it still fits...    very happy with my Nautilus NFS1000 suit"
509498,NAW,2010-10-05 19:36:00,4022,"I have to second all the comments about Salus.  IMO they are by far the best floaters on the market.  Life vests too.  Canadian made to boot.  I'm 5'11"" 220..  I picked up a Salus Endurance last season, and am way beyond happy with it..  The leg length is fully adjustable."
509499,lew,2010-10-05 19:39:00,12766,"Hey Goran, there's probably enuff room in your suit for both me AND your brother  After much deliberation I've decided I don't want to spend several hundred $$$$ for a suit that won't fit, so I've taken the advice of several of our members and am gonna go with the Mustang Integrity jacket and get bib pants to go with them.  Seems like lotsa good features to this coat, including the soft material in the collar and pit zips for ventilation.  Thanks everyone for your suggestions.  "
509564,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-05 22:37:00,0, This Alpha 1 suit sounds like the one I want. I am also 5'9-5'10 220+ lbs. Does BPS or lebaron carry them?

509967,Harrison,2010-10-07 12:18:00,2202," ouch, nice one Lew!!!  Just a note, how do you like your bananas? ripe ok?"
509167,lew,2010-10-04 19:49:00,12766,"Hey guys, I'm 5'9"" and 220 pounds and I can't find a survival suit to fit me. I've been looking for 2 years now but every suit I look at is for someone 6'4"" it seems. I can get them to fit in the chest but the legs are about a foot too long.  Nuthing up here in the Peterboro area and I just got off the phone with  Gagnons, BPS and LeB's and their suits are all for tall guys.  Where the heck do the un-tall and un-thin buy their survival suits ??"
509169,aplumma,2010-10-04 19:55:00,6896,This is one of the few times I am not trying to be funny but......Ask Roy or T.J. were they got theirs.   Art
509170,misfish,2010-10-04 19:55:00,29133,"As you know Lew ,I to am with that hieght issue aswell.LOL  I bought the the pro2000 and it fits just right.  Not sure whos selling them."
509171,cram,2010-10-04 19:56:00,1733," Hi Lew.  I was looking at floatation suits last night and the salus brand (which is made in KW, btw) apparently has telescopic legs. Not sure how that works, but presumably they might fit better than the one-size-fits-all that tend to err on the tall side.   Also, not sure if they make survival suits (vs. float suits, unless that's what you meant) but worth a look - Salus Marine."
509172,Garry2Rs,2010-10-04 20:00:00,1425,"Hi Lew; I have a survival suit that I don't need. It will fit you width-wise, but will be too long. If you take it to a tailor etc. you can have it adjusted to fit you.  Since it is free, the cost of remaking it will be less than the cost of a new suit. Garry"
509177,mattybculp,2010-10-04 20:15:00,388,"Hey Lew , I also live in the peterborough area and had the same troubles I am 5""10"" and around the same weight. The only spot i found that had one that fit me was grimsby tackle and it was a black and yellow bouy o boy one and it fits great i wear it for everything winter related, It was a few years ago that i picked it up from a muskie convention in st.catherines but give em a call."
509178,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-04 20:18:00,2582,I'll be following this thread. 5 foot 7 so mine in that much more too long for me
509179,BUSTER,2010-10-04 20:18:00,1336," 5'10 230LBS GUY HERE, with the same problem as you."
509180,BUSTER,2010-10-04 20:19:00,1336,ASK MERCER!!!!!!
509188,walleyejack,2010-10-04 20:46:00,358,"I replaced mine last year with Ice Armour. am short 5""8 180 and fits great, got it at gagnons"
509190,wkrp,2010-10-04 20:49:00,656,"As Cram mentioned give Salus a serious look . I bought one of their suits last year and very happy with it . I am 5'9"" and 210 lbs"
509191,TC1OZ,2010-10-04 20:53:00,987,I'd be interested to know as well! For a friend who's of those dimensions....
509195,Terry,2010-10-04 21:09:00,14456," but ice armour isn't flotation,,,,is it?"
509198,Lungelarry,2010-10-04 21:22:00,294,And some people say fishing isn 't a sport  :thumbsup_anim:
509199,Fisherman,2010-10-04 21:25:00,7201,"Well it shows the guy floating like a bobber, ""arctic ice armor"", maybe a newer product.  Couldn't find anything that says it's MOT and CCG approved for floatation."
509200,Tom McCutcheon,2010-10-04 21:29:00,627,"I don't know who the designer is for those suits but they must be between 5'10 and 5'11 and between 195 and 200 lbs.  You guys can't get one with arms and legs short enough and I am at the other end of the spectum 6'5 and just short of 300lbs.  I have contacted the head office of several manufacturers and the answer at all of them was the same ""TOO BAD, SO SAD""  Apparently Stacy Ash at Pro Tackle near Belleville has a line on a new product which will be out this fall he guarantees will fit me.  Tom."
509209,Terry,2010-10-04 21:50:00,14456, I think Ice Armour and Arctic Armour are 2 different companies
509215,Sinker,2010-10-04 22:08:00,8692," Yes, they are.  I'm in the market for an Arctic armour suit right now. I'm trying to find a camo suit, and having a hard time locating one. Anyone seen one around?? They do float, they're water proof and breathable too. Only come in two pieces as well, so getting one to fit is much easier. They're a lot more comfy than  my old mustang survival suit too!! Just the breathable factor alone is enough to sway me that direction. They're not CCG approved, but they float for sure. I always have  PFDs aboard anyways, so no big deal. I don't think my camo mustang is approved either, only because of the colour!!  Im tall and thin........my XXL mustang suit is just worn right out after 15 years of hard use.  S."
509218,Terry,2010-10-04 22:13:00,14456,"thought so  my flotation suit is around 25 years old  I didn't like the fit, being around the 5.9 mark  last fall I bought a 2 piece and I have never been warmer or more comfortable only the jacket is flotation and bib pants don't float"
509221,HTHM,2010-10-04 22:22:00,4082,"Aww, com'on Garry. No need for that, if you fall overboard we DO want you to survive."
509223,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-04 22:27:00,0,  yer gonna have the opposite problem Lews having....lol
509232,misfish,2010-10-04 22:54:00,29133," WHO YOU KIDDING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SHRIMP.   Very nice offering Garry."
509242,BillM,2010-10-05 00:08:00,17367,"I gotta sell the brand new Mustang Integrity HX I got last year, it's not tall enough, lol."
509243,walleyejack,2010-10-05 00:09:00,358,"IceArmor is not flotation,but my Boy O Bouy,is just wore out,knees shot,and all the insulaition in the arms is down at the cuffs, but I really like the IceAromor,easier to get around,less bulky,more comfy,and much warmer. I only use it for ice fishing and in the early season i wear my boy o bouy, just in case,I dont want the helicoper looking for me   "
509251,BUSTER,2010-10-05 00:24:00,1336,"I just got back from sweating my lowers off, tried on a few suits and broke the bank, settled for the Helly Hansen Alpha 1 float suit in extra large, fit really well, only issue was the hood has to be out ,not rolled up in the collar, I cant stand the thick collar that wont fold down, felt like someone was pushing on the back of my head, little expensive, but the delta 1 and delta 2 and the other one didnt fit like this one.Piss zipper,suspenders,pockets sold me. good luck lew, but I'd have to say try one on, Iam 5'10-5'11,225 ok maybe 235! Fit well.  Cheers"
