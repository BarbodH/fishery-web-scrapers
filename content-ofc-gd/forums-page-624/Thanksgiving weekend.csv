509925,Raycaster,2010-10-07 03:22:00,528,"The family is ""stealing"" one last weekend by renting a cottage on Sandy Lake.  This isn't really a fishing trip but the guys will get out every chance possible. We'll probably play on Sandy Lake for awhile but try to get a full day over at Lower Buckhorn.  Any advice is sure welcome as it's a first time for all of us at this location.  Last year we rented in Brit and out of shear luck landed a couple big pike so hopefully luck will return. Snowed on us too.."
509929,Carp,2010-10-07 03:31:00,1488,Saturday  My daughter has a hockey game at 11:45am  My son has a hockey game at 5:10pm and practice at 7pm at his home rink. Should be an interesting evening. At least I get out of Thanksgiving dinner with the wife's family.   Sunday and Monday are up in the air.  I'm doing some renovations in the kitchen. I have some smaller jobs to keep me busy until the new counter tops arrive.  I also have to finish the brake job on my truck. Only did the rear.  Going to try and get out bow hunting.

510065,Pikeslayer,2010-10-07 17:55:00,1443,"Well, things could not have turned out better. Was supposed to have the family + the outlaws (son-in-laws family) up to the cottage for a Thanksgiving weekend (= more cooking/entertaining & less fishing) pending the birth of a grandchild which was due Sept. 30th. As it turns out, my daughter is 'past due' and scheduled for induced labour tomorrow morning (meaning the baby should arrive sometime Friday or Saturday). So get this; the 'women-folk' don't want the men (except for son-in-law) hanging around and getting in the way. We recieved our marching orders last night. The men are to retreat to the cottage and stay away until Sunday or Monday. They'll let us know when to come home. Honest to goodness, true story. So we'll be fishing for pike & walleye. The ladies (& son-in-law) will be fishing for a baby."
510180,danbouck,2010-10-07 22:12:00,4380,Well I'll be at the cottage so I'm sure all of you can figure out what I'm fishing for!
510182,JoshS,2010-10-07 22:15:00,729,"Plans just changed.  If anyone has a spot, I'd love to get out!  I'm located in TO and a die hard fisherman for everything but carp. If not I will probably hit up some rivers and maybe some local pike or brown haunts."
