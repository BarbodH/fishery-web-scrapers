509377,Shaun Rickard,2010-10-05 13:51:00,144,"My mate Kris and I have made it out a few times over the past few weeks in several bays around the Toronto Harbour area. We spend a lot of time running and gunning from one bay to another looking for active fish, and it has paid off so far. We've boated around 50 or so Pike in the past few weeks, a lot of smaller guys but a few nice one's too.  The water temps have varied considerably, from 49F one weekend to 62F the next. During the colder temps the fishing was natuarally much slower, we had to slow our presentations way down to entice a bite. The most productive baits by far have been the Rapala Husky Jerks and X-Raps, using a very subtle twitch pause retrieve, and you guessed it, 90% of the fish we have caught hit the bait on the pause. I'll let the bait sit without twitching it for 5 to 10 seconds at times, it takes patience try it, it's harder to do than it sounds lol! As far as colours, Silver/Black, Baby Bass, Perch and Tennessee Shad have worked well. As you'll see below in some of the action shots, the Terminator spinnerbaits nailed a few fish too, 1/2oz in white/chartreuse. The spinnerbaits will generally only prove to be productive when the water temps are at or above the 60F mark, below that the pike generaly won't hit the faster presentation.  The most productive times for us have been a little later in the morning, between 8am and 11am, once the water warms up a little from the sun the Pike seem to wake up and put on the feed bag. The Fall is a great time to have a shot at hooking into some good sized Pike as the larger females move into these bays for the Winter.  If you fish these bays please do me one favour, practice catch and release. These fish are no good to eat and are way to valuable a resource to kill off for no reason. How many cities in the world can you catch trophy pike? Not many, so let's put them back for everyone to have a shot at enjoying.  below are a few shots of some of the better fish we've hooked and boated:                              Cheers, Shaun"

509439,ld17,2010-10-05 17:01:00,319,"Nice pike Shaun, I have a question.  When you were using the jerkbaits did you have a wire leader?  If so how did it affect the action of the bait?  Thanks.  Are you starting up a tv show again.  I haven't seen anything new lately.  Cheers"
509449,Joey,2010-10-05 17:20:00,9122,Nice Jack's Shaun.  I like the pics where the fish are still in the water - cool!  Looks like you know where to find them  Good going.  Joey
509463,Shaun Rickard,2010-10-05 17:55:00,144," No, we're just fishing buddies, can't keep him out of the boat  Cheers, Shaun"
509465,Shaun Rickard,2010-10-05 17:58:00,144," Yes LD17, I always use a wire leader, a really fine 7 strand one, with a small swivel at each end, I tie one end to the main line then slide the other swivel directly onto the split ring on the bait.  As for the show, we're working on some stuff, stay tuned  You can view updates on our FB page at the link below.  Cheers, Shaun"

510335,Shaun Rickard,2010-10-08 13:50:00,144," bassman, the beauty of this type of fishing is that if you live in the GTA and only have a few hours on a weekend you can head out early in the morning, catch some quality fish, and be home before lunch time, thus avoiding spousal abuse lol!  Cheers, Shaun"
