509098,ADB,2010-10-04 16:09:00,444,"The season starts on Thursday.  If anyone is interested in a pool, PM me or send me an e-mail to [emailÂ protected]"
509101,Rod Caster,2010-10-04 16:17:00,5784, Are you making up the pool yourself or are you gonna use an online venue like nhl.com or cbc?
509109,ADB,2010-10-04 16:45:00,444," My own pool, but it will be posted on an online pool-managing site."
509322,Stoty,2010-10-05 04:18:00,2910,What is the format?  Rosters? Positions? Points?  Is it draft or fantasy format?  What pool-hosting site are you using? I HIGHLY recommend Yahoo! Fantasy Hockey (I'm a hardcore poolie and that's what I use)
509405,ADB,2010-10-05 15:14:00,444,"Trying for a somewhat larger field, so it's a simple box pool. Roughly 10 players from each position, plus some rookies and sophomores.  Points will be simply one point for a goal, one for an assist.  I'll be using officepools.com "
