I have the little buddy heater right now and I find it a bit big. This one has about 7000 BTUs and the little buddy will max at 9000 BTUs, so they are pretty close to temperature.  Thanks, Rob C"

510334,GBW,2010-10-08 13:49:00,8460,I picked up a used one of these Coleman Black Cat for $25.00 or so and it works great in my clam 2000 hut.
510341,Fang,2010-10-08 13:57:00,1330,I've been quite comfy the last 2 years using a 3000 BTU in a 1 and a 2 man hut. With this one you'd probably be fishing in short sleeves. I might pick one up to try. At this $ that's a good deal. First thing would be to build a better base though
