509063,Spiel,2010-10-04 13:27:00,9065,Sure do.
509082,perchslayer666,2010-10-04 14:50:00,280,"Sweet baby jesus!!! 7 hundo is a lot for a rod, but then again it looks and probably feels like a million bucks.... This is a hard one to think about...."
509084,solopaddler,2010-10-04 14:53:00,8605,   You could have the exact same rod built for a lot less money with less expensive components.
509088,Spiel,2010-10-04 15:09:00,9065,"   True, you could go with lower cost guides, prefab handle and no Stuble hardware and bring the cost down by a few hundred. "
509111,TJQ,2010-10-04 16:50:00,7806,Sweet Rod!!
509692,Fish Farmer,2010-10-06 13:21:00,2234,"Mike, I hope you catch some nice Steelhead with that piece of art. The 5'ultra light rod Chris made me was for 2 to 4 lb.test and I only seem to catch big Muskie on it and some BIG beauty Sheep-head.  Doing the math on the size of your Spiel rod, your Steelhead should come in around 50 to 100 lb. Can't wait to get into some of those Quinte Sheephead. MAN not being on the water for a few days, makes me think in strange ways Nice rod Mike, I had your seat in my hand, that thing is like gold. I also saw a few stages of it being built. Chris told Brook to keep an eye on me that your rod wouldn't grow legs"
509707,dobee,2010-10-06 14:18:00,301,thats a real beaut!!   nice work spiel!
509722,solopaddler,2010-10-06 15:41:00,8605,"  I heard all about the big musky you caught perch fishing, quite a feat!  Good luck out in Quinte."
509723,tb4me,2010-10-06 16:00:00,3295,wow nice work Spiel! Is this what you do for a living? im impressed. I woudnt mind a nice 1 pc ultra lite setup for bass and eyes on the river..
509728,Spiel,2010-10-06 16:24:00,9065," For a living, no! It's been a 35 year hobby that has turned into a near full time job lately.  I'm pretty busy right now but we can certainly discuss it further after the new year if you're interested."
508671,solopaddler,2010-10-02 14:41:00,8605,"I contacted Spiel 2 weeks ago to build me a new float rod, this one a 15' 4-8lb CTS.  Just picked it up this morning. The man does some pretty fine work and it's done fast.  This one was a bit more involved as the cork handle is made with individual rings and hand turned.  Great job Chris, THANK YOU!  Hopefully I can de-virginize it tomorrow.          "
508672,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-02 14:47:00,0,that's a gorgeous handle and seat.  got any free time spiel?
508674,Joey,2010-10-02 14:50:00,9122,"Wow, that is gorgeous.  Great work Chris  Joey"
508675,BillM,2010-10-02 14:50:00,17367,I'm going to have to make a drift with that sucker tomorrow
508676,kickingfrog,2010-10-02 15:06:00,8333,All these rod photos are making me envious.  Nice work Spiel.
508677,Spiel,2010-10-02 15:09:00,9065,"Free time.....LOL  I used to have free time until Solopaddler found out I built rods.  Thanks for the compliments and I'm pleased that you're happy with the work Mike. You'll also be happy to know the bottom section off the 13' you dropped off yesterday for stripping and rewinding is already spinning with the finish on, you're gonna be ecstatic."
508681,OhioFisherman,2010-10-02 15:51:00,6623,"Nice looking stick, quality work and low key."
508683,solopaddler,2010-10-02 16:07:00,8605,  That's actually hilarious LOL! You're a great guy to work with my friend.
508690,RickOnt,2010-10-02 16:52:00,669,"That Rod Should Catch Fish on Looks alone!!!!   Spiel  Do you make an Ice Rod???  Something in the 28""-32"" range, Med/heavy.  Rick"
508692,Spiel,2010-10-02 16:56:00,9065,"   Certainly do Rick, I have a few tip sections laying around here that might fit the bill. What are you targeting?"
508712,ChrisK,2010-10-02 20:12:00,2772,"Solopadler, That is one sweet float pole. Great workmanship from tip to butt from what I can see. You'll have to let us know how it measures up on the river.  Spiels working on a fly rod for me as well. Hopefully he'll have some spare time(between your poles)to get her put together this fall so I can try it out on some Huron trib steel"
508717,Leecher,2010-10-02 21:22:00,7832,Excellent craftsmanship Chris
508723,Dusky,2010-10-02 21:35:00,310,Fine craftsmanship!!!
508734,vinnimon,2010-10-02 22:43:00,2593,"Excelent craftmanship you have there, Chris!Im still deciding on what rod I want! Decisions, decisions !"
508750,Gerritt,2010-10-02 23:27:00,6129,"Mike, I was going to brag to you I had that rod in my hand before you... but figured someone would chime in and say I had you're ""rod"" in my hand LOL! it is a sweet rod however.. Chris did an amazing job on it... I understand the cork was a real pain in the arse as the darker rings have rubber in them.. and do not sand evenly compared to the cork which equals alot of added man hours and patience.  But the Burled maple seats, turned rings and the cork handles look awesome on that rod.  Chris is working on my new pickeral rod... this will be my third from him. Quality rods from a quality guy, plain and simple.  Sooo... when are we having beers at you're place? (from another thread.)   G"
508756,solopaddler,2010-10-02 23:44:00,8605,   That's funny 'cause I had your rod in my hand when I was over there.          The cork was a huge pita for sure. Chris did a helluva job and I'm pretty picky about my float rods.    That's gonna be a sweet rod.    As soon as possible.  I was thinking next week but I may be headed to the camp for thanksgiving.  I'll let you know bud.
508761,Loonietoon,2010-10-02 23:51:00,1450,
508768,John,2010-10-03 00:49:00,2956,I had Mike's rod in my hand too! Great job Chris. I saw it as a work in progress and she sure is a thing of beauty finished.
508810,ctranter,2010-10-03 05:19:00,543,That rod should be rotating in a glass case at the corner of Yonge and Queen for Nuit Blanche because that is a work of art!  very jealous
508826,WeedLine,2010-10-03 12:23:00,322,"Beautiful pole. Great workmanship Speil. Solo, I'm sure you'll have lots of fun and trout with that work of art."
508846,brickNblock,2010-10-03 13:15:00,598,"Yes-Sir, another fine Spiel special! There'll plenty of enjoyment outa that rod.  I am hoping to have one in time for next years lunge opener.."
508886,fish_fishburn,2010-10-03 17:12:00,1311,"Nice work Speil, can you elaborate on the blank a little more? The burl seat is sweet."
508888,splashhopper,2010-10-03 17:19:00,2931,I think I have rod envy
509026,perchslayer666,2010-10-04 04:33:00,280,"Very nice, how much?"
509034,Spiel,2010-10-04 09:31:00,9065,"Thanks again everyone, most kind.    I don't know much about the blank other than CTS' are available through John Collina at jccustomtackle.com in Caledonia. He designed the CTS line of Float Rod blanks for local steelheaders and they are getting great reviews from those using them.   Well prices can vary depending on components used but would likely run about $700.00."
