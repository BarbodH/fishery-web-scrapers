We were on the water by 09:00... bite was kind of slow today and the wind was a bit swift as was the current...we managed 10 Walleye and kept 7 averaging at 14""  With the occasional ""hand sized"" Rock Bass and a few Smallies..  All in all It was a great day.       Not bad for fishing in Downtown Sturgeon Falls.  Randy "
