366524,e-z-out,2009-07-26 23:12:00,1052,Damn Rocks we would still be out there fishing well Pete i hope it doesn't cost much
366528,musky66,2009-07-26 23:19:00,273,Exactly the reason why  you shouldn't use SS props- an aluminum one would have bent the prop and maybe not the shaft. But if hole shot and top end are important.....
366594,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-27 01:50:00,10439,"  Exactly, that's why all us shield lake guys use aluminum. Cheaper to fix or replace a prop than a lower unit."
366598,chinookhunter,2009-07-27 01:56:00,68,always go with aluminum props. s.s props look nice but will take out your bottom end even hitting a sandbar. (i found out the hard way)
366627,danc,2009-07-27 02:42:00,4677,I had to replace a prop shaft on a 60 hp Merc about 6 or 7 years ago. The cost was in the $600.00 range.
366845,tinbanger,2009-07-27 17:55:00,1028,sorry to hear that pete. Hope it doesn't take to big a bite out of your wallet . dave
366942,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-27 23:52:00,2038,   Man .....  When I read it was a 200 Yamaha even I cried.................
367084,hawg_hauler,2009-07-28 10:52:00,69,Putting an aluminum prop on a 200 would be like driving a car with no tires!
367088,Roy,2009-07-28 11:09:00,13728,Hard to imagine lower unit damage at 4mph. Good luck to you.
367107,e-z-out,2009-07-28 12:34:00,1052,Roy you had to be there to understand what happend. When i saw the Prop come out the water it looked like Waynes Prop on his Lund.

367444,e-z-out,2009-07-29 00:36:00,1052,Pete dont forget to bring the camara this time. This time around we need to use the trolling motor
367583,aniceguy,2009-07-29 13:34:00,1094, the torque would bend the aluminum prop
367604,blaque,2009-07-29 14:17:00,2419, seriously? dang
367610,fisher,2009-07-29 14:30:00,451,"Good to hear you are getting it fixed at a reasonable price.  I always make my self feel better by saying it could have been worse.  This past Spring Sal helped me out too.  I had the motor on my boat re-built last spring at Discount Marine and at the beginning of this year, one of the pistons was causing the boat to stall at top end.  Without hesitation Sal agreed to fix the problem - no charge even though my warranty had certainly expired on the rebuild.  Considering I used the boat all of last year without any problem, I was at least expecting to pay something.  Goes to show, he is really a good guy not out to fleece anybody.  Say hi to Sal for me when you pick it up - and let him know his consideration and reasonable prices are appreciated.  Frank (with the 40 HP Merc/16 foot Starcraft)"
