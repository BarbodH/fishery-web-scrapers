366264,fishinguypat,2009-07-26 01:56:00,547,i'm spooling my line soon for salm0n/trout and maybe pike /carp ..sooo i was wondering should i spool it with my trilene tough 8lb or trilene XL 14lb? i have always said 8 or over is good but i really want a better chance at salmon/trout this year ...what do you think?   fishinguypat
366269,Twocoda,2009-07-26 02:05:00,4130,Depends on the set up your using ....presentation is EVERYTHING if your float fishing ..so i recommend 8 # and reduce from there with a leader .... if your set up is for downrigging ....i run 20 pound but if your talking chucking lures in the river ...straight 8 pound ( you dont want to lose too many lures)  Good Luck
