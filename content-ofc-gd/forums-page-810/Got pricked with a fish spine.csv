367000,johnnyb,2009-07-28 02:11:00,3413,"Luc, if you haven't gone to see someone about this by NOW....   ...let us know how u make out"
367014,marth11,2009-07-28 02:32:00,60,def is infected i remember getting a good cut across the palm from a carp back in april/may disinfected it and bandaged it i recommend seeing a doc right away if you already then tell us how you did and get better
367018,Paully,2009-07-28 02:39:00,712,No big deal... Happened to a buddy of mine once too.  Cut off both his hand... he's all better now
367060,Sinker,2009-07-28 04:23:00,8692,Slime flu for sure!
367061,pacman77,2009-07-28 04:24:00,2,lol..I know how you feel I have been spiked a few times they hurt for a day or 2 as all fish spines have a degree of bacteria on them hard to see how the rash is related best to use a glove or towel when handling the spiny ones.
367128,LucG,2009-07-28 13:32:00,779,"Well...I'm still alive. I went to see a doc at a local clinic and he didnt seemed too concerned, but that didnt surprise me. By the time I had gone to see him, the red dots had faded and didnt seem as bad. He told me to go buy benadryl or reatin and sleep on it.  I woke up this morning with still no pain or swelling to my hand and all the spots are almost completely gone as well as any redness.  But I am feeling quite a bit of joint pain and general weakness throughout my body. Could this be from the meds?"
367129,LucG,2009-07-28 13:34:00,779, LOL
367133,TC1OZ,2009-07-28 13:40:00,987, Called it!  And yes...when you go to walk-in clinics be happy if they at least look you in the face while your talking to them lol!
367143,smally21,2009-07-28 14:23:00,993,benadryl and most antihistamines contain stong stimulants like ephedrine.  they act as vasal (vascular) dilators that shrink swollen cells and tissue.  like any amphetamine they can cause hangovers.  good thing you didn't eat this toxic fish of death.
367149,Rich,2009-07-28 14:42:00,3927,Wasn't there a dude on this board who was so allergic to fish he had to wear gloves all the time while fishing?  That looked pretty nasty dude. Glad it cleared up.
367497,wallyboss,2009-07-29 02:38:00,1095,I always have a bottle of Purel Hand Sanitizer in my tackle box.  After getting stung a couple of times by catfish and mudpout I tried the sanitizer and took the pain away instantly.  Before it used to hurt for 3-4 days.
367725,alphaalpha,2009-07-29 19:37:00,475," same, a guy i worked with got a slight cut up north and thought nothing of it.  the next day he was in hospital battling flesh eating disease.  he was/is a very large man (300ish) but lost about 80lbs and was very sick for quite a while.  the doc told him to always keep iodine with him while fishing, it kills everything the best.   i personally trust that a good dose of hand sanitizer will do the trick immediately upon any cut.  Its a very scary thing that these serious problems can arise from such a small start, i never take this type of injury lightly anymore.  AA."
367731,chinookhunter,2009-07-29 20:06:00,68,Go to a Docter !! Get the right advise when it comes to your health.
366796,LucG,2009-07-27 16:38:00,779,Four days ago I poked the palm of my hand on a big ol bass' spine. It never really got infected or hurt in anyway.  Then this morning I woke up to this. You can clearly see the area that I got poked in (arrow). And th hives/spots were all over my body. But only my hands were itchy. The only reason I am thinking it has to do with the spines is cause out of nowhere it becam red.  Has anyone else ever experienced similar symtomes in relations to fish spines?  
366799,BillM,2009-07-27 16:43:00,17367,Any chance the tip of the spine is still in your hand?
366804,LucG,2009-07-27 16:51:00,779,Not at all. It barely drew blood. It didnt go in very deep at all.  It almost looks healed.
366807,bushart,2009-07-27 16:52:00,2628,Maybe a trip to the doctor is in order---a few years back I knew someone that got blood poisoning from a good jab from a fish.  keep an eye on it for sure  Bushart
366810,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-27 16:57:00,0,it looks like you're mildly allergic to fish?
366811,LucG,2009-07-27 16:59:00,779, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Does that mean I can't go fishing?   lol
366813,fishinguypat,2009-07-27 17:03:00,547,i would say go to the doctor or a pharmacy to check it out...have you disinnfected it yet or added  lotion to stop the scratching?
366814,LucG,2009-07-27 17:08:00,779, The first thing I did when I got back that night was to put some antibiotic cream on it.  And I do not have anything at home for the itch. Going out soon to have it looked at.
366817,spinnerbaitking,2009-07-27 17:12:00,1622,"I would say you can go fishing just don't catch any thing & you should be fine MAYBE, honestly though I would have it looked at it looks nasty Tight Lines Richard"
366818,TC1OZ,2009-07-27 17:13:00,987,Definitely looks like an allergic reaction.  If you go to any walk in clinic they will just tell you to go get benadryl and sleep on it!  Gotta love our health care system!  In the US they would run a million tests (assuming you have health insurance lol)
366820,cpguy29,2009-07-27 17:22:00,148,"Yep, got stung by a pickeral last month on my palm near the thumb. Stung for a week, no blotches."
366822,Greencoachdog,2009-07-27 17:26:00,8163,Puncture wounds can be very dangerous!!!... NEVER put a topical antibiotic on a puncture wound!!! This will cause the top to heal over trapping any foriegn substance or particles underneath!!!  You may try lancing the original wound with a sterile needle and soaking your hand in hot (as hot as you can stand) epsom salt water.  ... but I say Go To The Doctor!!!
366835,Greencoachdog,2009-07-27 17:37:00,8163,"I just found this on the web.  1.If the puncture wound is contaminated, the victim should consult a doctor as soon as possible for a tetanus vaccination or booster shot. Wounds of the feet, those that cannot be cleaned right away, and wounds made by animals all have a high risk of contamination  There is fish slime in your puncture wound... this is not good!"
366841,LeXXington,2009-07-27 17:50:00,1928,"Outch, bad reaction"
366850,LucG,2009-07-27 18:08:00,779,I'm just glad I don't break out like this when I eat fish as well.....lol
366852,bushart,2009-07-27 18:12:00,2628,"Yeah but like the ""Dawg"" was sayin your not eatin the slime---and I'm sure has a touch of bacteria in it.  Best to err on the side of caution here---sometimes the simplest looking of injuries can turn into big problems unattended.  Bushart"
366858,Jonny,2009-07-27 18:52:00,1380,"Looks like an allegic reaction. My wife gets this same reaction to certain things. As you get older you can develop a reaction to things that didn't bother you before; it happened to her.  Benadryl is good advice (same as the doctor told my wife).  For disinfectant - iodine or hydrogen peroxide on the open wound. No good if it's skinned over. If it were me I'd make sure the puncture is well-open and give it a good shot of iodine.  I would say it's not very likely you have a piece of spine in it. The spines are flexible, not very brittle."
366872,Kinger,2009-07-27 19:53:00,351,Should have pee'd on your hand bro! Get some salve on that.
366898,Greencoachdog,2009-07-27 21:16:00,8163,"  It does look like an allergic reaction, but also looks like it's becoming infected as well!  ... but I may be wrong on both counts.   It may be this!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK_jDA3qrUU                                 ... have you noticed any hair trying to sprout from the afflicted area???"
366905,pike slayer,2009-07-27 21:29:00,1177,i would hope that fish didnt have aids haha! this is gonna break out into a whole new swine flu type thing maybe call it slime flu? oooo that was a growner lol
366906,smally21,2009-07-27 21:35:00,993,"while some allergic reactions dont appear immediately 4 days is extreme to show symptoms.  its possible you got into something else just prior to the reaction, as the rash is most definitely a reaction due to its tendency to not be local to the injury.  infection wouldn't explain  the rash but would explain increasing tenderness, reddening of the area and joint pain starting near the injury and spreading. blood poisoning results in extreme, and i mean EXTREME pain of the joints and serious swelling.  just to be sure you should catch the fish and put a stake thru its heart."
366908,camillj,2009-07-27 21:40:00,1988,OK ..two things ... one - infection ... definitely ... and very common from fish related cuts ... fastest cleanup ... wash your hands in warm water with a little comet or peroxide.... cleans it right out and kills literally everything ...  Second thing ... pretty likely .. but not for sure ... an allergic reaction to something ... could be the slime or could be the bacteria in the slime ... again quite common ... fast acting and relatively safe is ...REACTIN OR BENEDRYL  (BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND TALKING WITH YOUR DOCTOR FIRST IN CASE YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IT COULD REACT WITH)...dont drink alcohol ...
366939,curlrap,2009-07-27 23:44:00,58,That rash is defenitely a reaction to something. If the red area of the sting becomes larger or spreads that is  due to infection. If you start having a fever then you know there's something wrong and you should be going to the ER. A Doctor will most likely give you benedryl and possibly an antibiotic for precautinary reasons.
366948,bigfish1965,2009-07-28 00:52:00,3382,I think half the spine pokes or bites I get from fish get infected...must be something in their slime that is nasty. But that infection looks bad..yeesh. Let us know what the doc says!
366963,MJL,2009-07-28 01:21:00,2427,"As a kid I used to play with perch and bluegills that were 'living' in my uncle's ""white bucket"".  I'd get poked and had similar reactions to what you have.  The next morning I had rashes that itched a little on my hands and arms - A day or two later they were gone.  Since then, I haven't experienced anything like that for almost 20 years despite getting spined by some feisty sunfish and perch.  With that said, getting cut or poked by fish spines or other fishy parts is definitely no laughing matter.  A few years ago, my aunt told me a story about one of her friends getting a small cut while holding a pike by the gills.  The pike thrashed a bit and his hand slipped.  He received only a small nick.  3 days later it was infected to the point where he had to have several fingers amputated."
