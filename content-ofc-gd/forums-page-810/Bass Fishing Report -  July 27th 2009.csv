367263,Greencoachdog,2009-07-28 18:56:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Jacques!!!  Looks like you and Paul opened up a big ol' can of Whoop-Ass on some very nice Green Trouts!!!  Big smiles and big fish!... it doesn't get any better than that!!!
367276,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-28 19:14:00,2038,  Yep....  Dem Darn Green Trout were on Fiyaaaah yesterday....  :thumbsup_anim:   Tomorrow were heading out for some eyes....
367340,Leecher,2009-07-28 21:22:00,7832,"Thanks again folks for your kind replies   Thanks Glen    Them G trouts weren't in their usual holding pattern because of the water temp being so low.... normally they're so tight to shore that it's where we find them.... had to work a little harder to locate but once found, like you said ""just doesn't get any better than that  Going for golden eyes tomorrow... wish us luck!!!   Yeah Paul, they definitely were on fiyaaaah!!!! what a blast Will talk later!!! Jacques"
366952,Leecher,2009-07-28 01:03:00,7832,"Well folks, the mission today was for Paul and I to hit one of our local lakes for bass.... Weather wise up here is still not the greatest to put it simply.... Lots of rain and thunder storms.  Woke up this morning at around 6:30am, temperature was 18C with heavy clouds and a slight southerly wind at around 5KM/H... left home around 7:15am, made a pit stop to Timmies and the way we go!!!  Got to destination at around 8:00am.  Got the boat launched and started working the shoreline.... Immediately tied on ""The Little Woodie"" and started casting.... was not able to hook into any fish....  it then started to rain quite heavily....  so we put on the rain gear and kept working.   After maybe 10 - 15 minutes of casting with it,  I got a hit, set the hook and it got off    I was hoping to land one but alas it wasn't meant to be  So I switch over to a white BigO and rigged my second rod with #4 Octopus hook and a Gulp 5"" black sinking minnow and immediately hooked this beauty on the BigO!!!    As you can see the rain had finally subsided and we're able to remove some rain gear LOL We did not land any bass off of the shoreline but instead caught them in the middle of the lake on a hump that we know spawns from one end of the lake to the other.  On the hump is only 2' fow and on each side drops off to 15' - 20'.... this is where we caught most of our bass  Water temp was 70F which is really low compared to other seasons at this time of year.... should of been in the 80's by now.... this cause the bass to be hard to find in the pads and heavy weeds close to shore. They were in a scattered pattern but when we hit the hump.... well let just say we had a great time hooking into all kinds of bass of different sizes  Paul was landing great numbers on his white Northam spinnerbait & other lures that he had rigged up and I was doing the same on the BigO and Gulp..... Let just say that it was a 50+ fish day each!!!  I know it's unbelievable but this lake never cease to amaze me  We did manage to land a couple of decent ones and pics are displayed at the end....  Here is the ones that we were able to capture with the camera while it wasn't raining.... Enjoy              Here one with the Gulp in his yap!!!                     And last but not least.... the two biggest ones 3Lbs 13oz on my left and 3Lbs 8oz on my right on a digi scale!!!     On a final note here is the lures of choice today:  Spro frog, Buzzbait, White Spinnerbait, white BigO, Gulp 5"" sinking minnows in black and olive color....  Thanks Paul for a great time out bassin Hope you enjoy!!! Leechman"
