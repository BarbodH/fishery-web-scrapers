367053,bigugli,2009-07-28 03:46:00,6138,Half the fun in fishing is in what we share and the friendships we form in our adventures
367054,splashhopper,2009-07-28 03:49:00,2931,nice smallies.... I might try rigging the tubes I bought Last Year weedless and drag em across some weeds or Pond Scum  thanks for the idea
