366428,Mike the Pike,2009-07-26 18:21:00,3421,Well I have been back for a week now and am just getting around to posting a report .  Although we enjoy camping the wife wanted to rent a cottage this summer for a week.  I did some searching in February and found this place in the Quebec region of Parc Papineau Labelle not far from the well known Lac Simon region.  When I found this place on the internet I knew the wife would approve  did not take long to convince her. This was the first time I had rented a cottage with my family for an entire week.My oldest daughter who is 14 wanted to bring a friend so I said yes .Got to love having the minivan when you need to carry more people.  Here are the pics hope you enjoy!  First morning out my son catches his first ever smallie and a nice one it was.      Not to be out done by my son I caught this monster.Why do little fish hit wee lures?     Ah my younger Daughter Robin who is 12 is fishing again now if I could just get the 14 year old back into it.   It was a looney night fishing.       view from the screened in porch.   The wife doing what she does best painting a master piece.   Ah if only she coud fish like she paints.       finally!   I had a local tell me my son caught babv atlantic Salmon (lnd locked salmon)     One of the nicer days only 21C but hey we got to go to the beach which is accessable by boat only.   My daughter expressing her hate for deer flies and horse flies.       my eldest daughter(right) 14 in the tube with her friend.   about to blast off with the tube.This is the only time I miss my old  2 stroke it takes alot longer to get on plane.     coming back from tubing.     I get a lead on a good place to fish for bass and these ducks would not leave. every cast was follwed by the ducks   coming back from fishing I could not get the lakers to bite off my downriggers.     the yound lad wants his own boat someday.   What I love most about vacation doing nothing.                     Its july and a balmy 14C.what a heat wave.that was our vacation very cold and lots of rain.       Falls in Duhamel    This is my wife's completed painting.    Well that was our vaction Hope you enjoyed the pics.  MTP
366431,danbouck,2009-07-26 18:25:00,4380,Great Report!  Looks like everyone really enjoyed themselves even with the cold.
366432,lunkerbasshunter,2009-07-26 18:26:00,2585,wow great report and pics!!!  Cheers!
366434,Raf,2009-07-26 18:27:00,3495,i could barely see your son with the camo cast wrap thingy..  that's awesome.  your wife has some skills too.  looks like a great time with the family regardless of what the weatherman had in store.  well done
366435,Paully,2009-07-26 18:28:00,712,Looks like you had a nice time relaxing!  p.s  That Atlantic looks more like a common creek chub to me
366437,darsky,2009-07-26 18:34:00,586,ditto on the chub-1000%
366438,Mike the Pike,2009-07-26 18:38:00,3421, I had a local Darren tell me it was baby quananiche.I thought chub also. The guy who owns a marina there told be the baby salmon are black down ther spine and bright silver. when they mature the spine turns green.I never seen something so little fight hard like these thing.Ryan caught about a dozen or so.  Sounds like the local has the fish ID  wrong?
366439,Terry,2009-07-26 18:42:00,14456,looks like a great trip  and great painting
366440,Greencoachdog,2009-07-26 18:42:00,8163,Great report and pics Mike!!!  It looks like y'all had a real good time!... and that looks like a real nice cabin!!!  Your wife is a talented artist!  I'll second the Chub and not an Atlantic.
366461,camillj,2009-07-26 19:59:00,1988,"Great report ... thanks for sharing ... I wasnt gonna mention it because there was no reason to take away from your fabulous report ... but since its already happened, I'd have to agree .. chub 100% ... BUT ... one of the other dozen or so that he caught  may well have been a baby land locked salmon ... just not the one in the picture ... would have been excellent bait by the way"
366464,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-26 20:05:00,3761,"Great report, looked very exciting yet restful! Good job on the fish catching too.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
366510,Leecher,2009-07-26 22:29:00,7832,"Hey Mike excellent report and pics Mon ami  Duhamel is just an hour & half from where I live and you could not have choosen a more beautiful place for your vacation!!!  Like others said, your son's holding a lake chub not an atlantic.... most of the lakes and creeks will hold them... they sure can put up a good tussle  Congratulations to your wife for this awesome creation    a real beauty!!! Looks like you guys had a great time even in this kind of weather Thanks for taking the time to post your adventure and sharing it with us Jacques"
366511,medmart,2009-07-26 22:32:00,587,Hey Mike great report looks like every one had a great time the weather could be better but we have to take what we get when does Ryan's cast come off? your wife does some great work  Rob
366618,Mike the Pike,2009-07-27 02:29:00,3421, Rog he got his cast off on Monday its been off for six days but he finds it tender I wish he was in the pool more but the weather won't permit such a thing.  I will be at Dan's next weekend for some slamon salmon.  Mike
366622,splashhopper,2009-07-27 02:37:00,2931,"great pics..  great painting  amazing cast .. i ""almost"" want one too"
366628,Rich,2009-07-27 02:45:00,3927,"Excellent report! Looks like a blast for you & yours. Awesome.  For the record it is a fallfish, definitely in no way a salmon."
366647,ciceri,2009-07-27 03:23:00,535,Nice trip..  Defiantly a Chub.

366717,johnnyb,2009-07-27 13:08:00,3413,"Great report MTP!!   Thanks for finally getting around to it   You need a bigger, more stable boat, so your wife can paint while you fish"
367008,Mike the Pike,2009-07-28 02:24:00,3421, I would like her to change her themes and paint something fishing related. I would have prefered an all out fishing camp but I had to compromise.  Thanks for the kind words and compliments folks.  MTP
