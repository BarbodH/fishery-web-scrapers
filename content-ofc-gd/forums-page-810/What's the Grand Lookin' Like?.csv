367154,Rich,2009-07-28 14:49:00,3927,Just got an offer to stay at a friend's trailer tonight up Brantford way and fish the grand. After all this rain I cant see it being prime fishing conditions.. anybody been out that way lately that can give some river conditions?
367214,tbayboy,2009-07-28 17:38:00,1497,"Hey Rich, I did a quick couple hours between storms on Sunday near Kitchener (so not quite your area).  The water level was surprisingly low given all the rain and there wasn't any more current than normal but the water was pure chocolate milk so not surprisingly I had nothing to show for it.  Can't speak for Brantford but that's what  I saw."
367215,Victor,2009-07-28 17:40:00,1609,"Hey Rich, I fished the Kitchener stretch for about 2 hours with Marko and another member yesterday evening. The flow wasn't all that fast but it sure was murky. We had nothing to show for it as well (fishing for carp)."
367251,packrat,2009-07-28 18:32:00,93,Looked at the river in Brantford this morning-----starting to drop and clear somewhat.   Lots of algae floating around.
367315,LeXXington,2009-07-28 20:26:00,1928,If you see Noah go by can you please let me know..    http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cf...b1=6&Sub2=5
367345,tbayboy,2009-07-28 21:31:00,1497,Party pooper Lexx.  Glad I got out before that spike
367348,Rich,2009-07-28 21:34:00,3927,"Thanks for the info. Didn't end up going tonight.. probably headed there tomorrow morning. Looks like it should have dropped significantly by then,... provided there isn't more rain tonight."
367352,Musky or Specks,2009-07-28 21:39:00,2710,Rich saw someone fishing it today in K-Dub but Im sure it was piscatorial self abuse as the river was chocolate.
