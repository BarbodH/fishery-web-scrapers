367111,TC1OZ,2009-07-28 12:51:00,987,Thats too cute!  I'm gonna let my little guy learn to walk before fish! (Even though some of you might disagree!)

Kudo's to you for taking the time with Botbot  to teach her about fishing and our natural surroundings. It is time well spent. My daughter loved fishing, or at least spending time with DAD...until she discovered boys  ...but now her son just turned 1 and Grandpa is looking forward to fishing with the wee ones again    Had my daughter out ice fishing....in a heated hut...when she was 3 months old. I really can't remember if we caught anything, but I do remember all the fishermen in the Bombadiar on the way in and out fussing over Erika and the big smile on Debbe's face the whole time people where fussing over her pride and joy!  PLUS breatfeeding in the hut!!!! I would think I was the only guy on Simcoe that got to see boobies on the ice.  How can you beat that?"
