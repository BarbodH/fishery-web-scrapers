367138,Backroad Benny,2009-07-28 14:00:00,6,"Good guess, Cudz. This lake in NW Ont. seems to have just finished the spawn within the last 3 weeks, so these big females have a lot of filling out to do yet. I was thinking an even 4lbs."
367146,Cudz,2009-07-28 14:31:00,2652,Yeah maybe closer to 4.  I can't tell the girth.  Generally when I see the fish live I have a good shot.  I caught one the other day and guessed it was 3.4 pounds.  On digital it was 3.37.  Last night I guessed 2.4 pounds and it was 2.34 pounds.  Last week I guessed 3.8 and the fish was 3.95.  I am getting better at this game.

366897,badman187,2009-07-27 21:11:00,28,This one was close to 5lbs
366901,Backroad Benny,2009-07-27 21:27:00,6,"Awesome! Hard to gauge weight on a smallie from the ""brag shot"". But thanks for putting up the tape pics with the girth. Those solidify it's definately a pig. Great job releasing that to be caught another day as well.  What do you guys think this one goes weight wise? It's 19.5"".  "
367073,Cudz,2009-07-28 06:00:00,2652,4.41 pounds
