366755,trapshooter,2009-07-27 14:49:00,1234,"  I've seen them all.     I guide for the lodge that Linda owns (Moosehorn).  She's a great muskie angler and dedicates a lot of time to chasing them.  Her biggest this year is a 54.5"" and her fishing partner boated a 56 1/4"" monster last week.    Between them they have 10 over 50"" this year alone."
