Had 4 come right to boatside hot... one even attacked my spinnerbait on the figure 8, but bit on the darn blade, not the hook!   Two of the follows were in the 40"" class. Totals for the day were 4 follows, one hooked and lost on a jump, one landed, a 31"". The 31"" is the first muskie I have ever caught on a spoon... mind you, unless there is also pike in the lake, I rarely give spoons a shot for muskies. anyone else use spoons regularly for skis?  "
367230,muskeybugged,2009-07-28 18:01:00,282,Nice one.... Clean..... Sounds like my report!  Yet to try spoons myself.... thanks for all the more reason to try em'

367342,musky66,2009-07-28 21:29:00,273,Spoons work for sure- my first two 'ski came on a crackle frog Daredevil with a single Siwash hook I dressed with deer hair. A few years later my father got his first on the same spoon. I have a hard time throwing spoons though as for the correct action- you need to swim them kind of slow. Mine came while working it high and hard- the fish were on that day!

367351,Greencoachdog,2009-07-28 21:38:00,8163,That's a real purdy fish Pete!!!  .. sounds like you should've been throwing spoons all day!
367353,Musky or Specks,2009-07-28 21:43:00,2710,We regularly use big spoons and they have produced fish just no monsters.
