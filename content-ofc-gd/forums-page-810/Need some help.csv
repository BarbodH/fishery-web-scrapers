367363,xrap,2009-07-28 21:53:00,683,Me and my dad are planning on going on a fishing trip for this long weekend. Were coming from Hamilton and looking for a 6-7 hour drive at max. Were interested in catching walleye bass and pike and renting a boat. Can anyone recommend any good lodges or resorts they have been successful with in the past?  Thanks

367405,smally21,2009-07-28 22:56:00,993,take a look at tamarvacations.com friend said he had a good time at muskiebayresorts many places around the kawarthas that dont require driving too far good luck
367420,solopaddler,2009-07-28 23:29:00,8605," Not that it really matters but Bisco is 7 hours tops from Hamilton.  There's lots of places closer than Bisco, but how many are on a 26km lake that has but one camp, with walleye fishing that's comparable to a fly in?  Also Ray's camp is not on Biscotasing lake. They pick you up in a water taxi, take you to the very end of the lake and your stuff is hauled over to Ramsey lake with a tractor. From there it's a boat ride to the camp.  It's as remote as you can get within that driving range.  I've been to Ramsey a bunch of times. Never stayed at Ray's camp, always camped. There's a rough boat launch in Cat Bay at the north end of the lake. Good for light aluminum boats only.."
