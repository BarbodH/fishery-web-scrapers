367069,Cudz,2009-07-28 05:19:00,2652,We had a blast tonight fishing for less than 2 hours off a dock.  We managed 10 fish (nothing big but lots of fun)  2.4 pounds was the largest. Crazy double header smallie bullhead all interupted by a phone call in the middle of it.  Too funny. Lots of fun and I will do it again soon. 2.4 pounder  Strange double header  Last cast of the night   I also fished the same area this aft from my boat and lost a big fish but still managed 5 smallies and a bunch of perch. nice little fat fish
