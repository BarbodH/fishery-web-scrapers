366998,Rattletrap2,2009-07-28 02:09:00,1652,That's interesting! I worked on the Twin Otter line in Downsview from 1977 to 1979. It was a pretty interesting time in my life.  Are there any other ex- DeHavilland people out there?
367002,kickingfrog,2009-07-28 02:14:00,8333,"They mentioned that they found the old press from Downsview, where it had been outside for years. They shipped it out to Alberta and are using it, although they are still trying to figure out some of the notes written in marker on the press. Maybe you could set them straight?"
367208,I'mHooked,2009-07-28 17:07:00,525," Not me personally, however my father-in-law worked on the Otter, Beaver, Caribou, Buffalo etc... I guess with 45 years in he pretty much worked on them all. Engineering dept. The family day they have is always interesting to cruise around the plant.  As a private pilot I knew we would get along just fine when the girl friend (wife now!) first told me her dad built planes!"
