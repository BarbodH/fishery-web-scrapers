The lakes I will be on are Big Crow, Crow Bay, Lake Lavielle, Dickson Lake and Wright Lake. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to fish in these lakes? And tips on how to fish for Lakers and Brookies in these lakes I am leaving Wednesday July 29th so a quick reply would be much appreciated. I look forward to hearing from you cheers"

367144,drumstick_jolly,2009-07-28 14:23:00,7,  what does that mean?
367169,BillM,2009-07-28 15:19:00,17367,  That means tell us a little about yourself...  Asking for fishing info in your first post isn't a very good way of introducing yourself
367228,drumstick_jolly,2009-07-28 17:59:00,7,"Im sorry, this is my first forum I have ever joined so I am not familiar with the unwritten rules.  Anyways, I am a 23 yearl old male living in Windsor ontario. I have been canoeing for the past 5 years and just deciding that I would test my luck fishing. I tried last year up in algonquin just casting from shore, but I didnt really know what I was doing. Needless to say, I didnt catch a thing. I am moving up to Northern Saskatchewan at the end of august with my girlfriend. I figured there would be a lot of fishing up there as well, another reason why I joined the forum. I plan on reporting back about my trip too tell you all what works and what doesnt on the lakes that I fish.  Again, I am sorry for being rude, I didnt realized that that wasnt appropriate. I leave tomorrow though so I was hoping for a quick reply  Cheers"
367253,Jigster,2009-07-28 18:37:00,33,Drumstick - you'll see a main lake point on your left in proulx with a nice campsite  before hanging a left for the passage to big crow - there are brookies to be had aroud this point in off the dropoff... as for big crow I would make sure to camp on one of the three choice sites right next to the entrance to crow river as all other sites are not nearly as nice and swampy. Also watch for the swampy area before getting into crow river - i tipped a canoe there with a past girlfriend and the area is infested with leeches. Thank god we escaped from that one unharmed... fish big crow at the log jam for brookies... i've never fished dickson but i hear if you can make it up to Laveille good times are to there for the taking...

367535,drumstick_jolly,2009-07-29 06:32:00,7,"  Thanks a lot That was awesome I will be staying on Lavieille for 2 nights. Do you know of any hot spots on this lake or what to use?  Its a pretty big lake. Also, do you have any tips on trolling from a canoe. Im going to use the three way swivel tecnique. how exactly do I get the bottum though? from what i gathered, the lakers are way down there Thnks again"
