367206,MJL,2009-07-28 17:02:00,2427,Can anyone recommend a place to stay in Dunnville?  My dad and I are looking for a decent (yet inexpensive) motel to stay for one night (this Friday).  We’re just need a goodnight’s rest and a shower - We’ll be roughing it out at a carp tourney the next couple of days.  Thanks

Or better yet... MSG Fishmaster - he's in the area... he could better lead you."
367279,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-28 19:19:00,1022,On your way to dunnville you will see a motel on your right about 1km before the bridge. PM for potential spots to try if interested since your making the trek from the GTA. I saw them playing on the top of the surface in the shallows about 3+ weeks ago. Good luck.
