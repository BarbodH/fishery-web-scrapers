367255,TC1OZ,2009-07-28 18:40:00,987,hahaha. I have noticed you've been wearing that hat in your pics...and they seem to be over several years!
367280,bigugli,2009-07-28 19:20:00,6138,The fish in Martindale will be spooked for at least a week come Friday and there won't be any available shoreline. The Henley rowing regatta beings this weekend. Hundreds of rowing shells and motor boats zipping back and forth 12 hours a day.
