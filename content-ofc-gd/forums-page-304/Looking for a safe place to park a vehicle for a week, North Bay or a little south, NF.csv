My Dad and me want to head to Haliburton, my cousin back home to the Hammer, my brother to Ahmic Lk for the week (lucky bugger)  anybody from the area (North Bay, Powassin, Trout Creek) have a tip on a safe place to leave a vehicle for a week? A green P, train station, hotel?  thanks in advance Chris"
790274,Bernie,2013-06-04 00:28:00,3190,Hello Chris. How many vehicles?

790289,Muskieman,2013-06-04 01:21:00,2472,Are you talking hwy 11 in Marten River / Temagami area  ? If so you can park it in my yard in Sturgeon FREE and safe ..
790290,Bernie,2013-06-04 01:28:00,3190,"You can park it in our yard in Powassan Chris. Lots of room now, most of the boats are gone."
790291,Joeytier,2013-06-04 01:28:00,3990,The northgate plaza is a common long term parking area and right on the highway.  If you park right along highway fence you will be worry free.
790311,Nipfisher,2013-06-04 03:44:00,2449,"Chris, I can offer up a spot in my driveway. It is 3 cars wide and the boat usually goes on one side but it it at the trailer. I am only one minute from the bypass. No inconvenience whatsoever. I'll PM you."
