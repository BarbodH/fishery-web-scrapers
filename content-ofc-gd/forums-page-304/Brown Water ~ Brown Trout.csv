790206,misfish,2013-06-03 20:57:00,29133,Great fish and outing.  I cant wait to get my first legit brown on a fly.  Great pan shots. I like that feature on my camera.

790214,fish_finder,2013-06-03 21:24:00,370,That coupled with the right fly and technique definitely gets the job done.

790225,Musky or Specks,2013-06-03 21:48:00,2710,This is a magnificent report with some truly spectacular fly caught browns. Thank you I am green with envy. If your ever looking for someone to join you feel free to PM me.
790236,fish_finder,2013-06-03 22:10:00,370," No idea where abouts you live, but if you're headed to this area and want to get out, shoot me a message.  I live in Guelph, plenty of decent trout fishing around here.  These fish aren't from around here though...  The least I could do is show you some setups and techniques anyways."
790260,BillM,2013-06-03 23:34:00,17367,"Nice job Dave, water looks up put pretty clear."
790264,wallacio,2013-06-03 23:52:00,475,I'm confused...I can't find Nunyer Creek on any maps???
790269,fish_finder,2013-06-04 00:14:00,370,Its there if you look hard enough.  I'll post a treasure map later dude
790270,fish_finder,2013-06-04 00:14:00,370, Was pretty mucky in the morning.  By the time I decided to start snapping pics it had cleared up quite a bit.
790275,BillM,2013-06-04 00:29:00,17367, Gotta love rivers that clear up that quickly.  Upper Pine is very similar.
790279,esoxansteel,2013-06-04 00:37:00,1307,"Very nice report, gotta love Browns"
