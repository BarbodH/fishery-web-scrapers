Has any tried to use an NMEA compatible cell phone for gps with their fish finder. While its not necessary, as I have the GPS on the phone and could use it along side my finder. Im wondering if anyone has tried this type of setup before. The down side to this is it would require 3 cables to connect the phone to the finder, only to see if it would work. Any thoughts?"
