790883,wkimwes,2013-06-06 17:09:00,76,Good read and glad this is being put up front.
790939,Musky or Specks,2013-06-06 21:40:00,2710,Interesting I wonder if that female catch rate %/time frame is just a Haliburton phenomena or whether that is a province wide occurance. If so that  July 30 season ending timeeline should be adopted every where.
