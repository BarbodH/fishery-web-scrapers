790703,danc,2013-06-05 23:36:00,4677,I've always preferred a knife thats a little less than razor sharp for filleting. I have a Fiskars rubber handled serrated filleting knife thats somewhere between 15 and 20 years old. No maintainace reqiured. Still works like new. I like it.

790710,aplumma,2013-06-06 00:04:00,6896,I have put a few knifes at 10 degrees for people who ask but have found they mistreat the edges and dull them quickly. I have a few straight razors that are at 6 degrees and they have been honed to .05 microns they make a scalpel look dull. I did it mostly to see how far I could push the envelope more than as a practical use. I ran my finger down the side of the edge (I thought) and didn't feel the cut till I saw the blood. As I guess people know I like the concept and execution of a finely honed knife it is kind of a hobby for me.   Art
790712,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-06 00:09:00,8243,"I have a 30 year old Rappala knife that works 12 months a year. I don't agree they are garbage. Maybe the knives sold today, certainly not those from 30 years ago. The blade is almost gone now. I have a pal sharpen all my knives for me and use the steel on it every time used, I don't know what he uses but you can shave a baby's bum with it, I'll ask him. Sometimes use the steel on it more than once during the job."

790723,Metisfisherman,2013-06-06 01:03:00,11,"Extremely hard and durable, the carbide can be ground to a much keener and more durable edge than common carbides. Each of the two blades has four edges and can be rotated to a new edge if one is accidentally damaged. The sharpener comes as a right-handed version but the blades are easily reversed to convert it for left-handed use. To sharpen a knife you just draw it through the intersecting carbide blades with light pressure. A very dull knife may initially require several light passes but can be maintained thereafter with a single pass for touch-ups. Not only is it easy to use, but if used with care, it should last for as long as you (or we) live."
790738,Nipfisher,2013-06-06 02:33:00,2449,"Joeytier, I use the Edgemaker Pro like a few others have mentioned. It is fast and easy and makes the blade super sharp. Probably rips up the blade a bit like Art explains but works extreemly well and is cheap. If you are around town check mine out."
790582,Joeytier,2013-06-05 11:12:00,3990,I have a very nice folding Buck filet knife.  Very impressed with it...blade stayed sharp for much longer than any other knife I've owned in the past however it is now quite dull.  Never liked the multipurpose sharperners...I have a fine stone and some oil but I clearly don't know what I'm doing because I've yet to really see any results.  What is your favourite method?
790583,Andy,2013-06-05 11:25:00,330,"I don't seem to have much of a feel with a sharpening  stone either. I'll try it if the knife is an absolute mess. Otherwise I just pull it thru one of those red Rapala  ceramic stone sharpeners/hones, and if I have it handy, I touch it up with a steel after. Doing this whenever I feel the knife isn't what it used to be seems to keep them sharp enough for me."

I couldn't tell you what angle I use, it's just something you'll need to figure out for yourself. Once I have the edge I want, it's very easy to keep it with just a bit of work on the stone."

I have chefs bring their knife rolls to me to sharpen for a fee of course and they keep coming back. If you have 2 or 3 friends that can slit the cost with you it will make it about the same price as a good set of oil stones. It actually becomes addictive to see how sharp you can get a knife I am now up to using .05 micron pastes to polish the edges to a mirror shine on some of the higher end knifes.   Art"
790587,wormdunker,2013-06-05 11:37:00,1711,X2 for the Lansky sharpening system.  The trick is to sharpen your knife at the proper angle.  The jig holds your knife at the proper angle.  I've had very good results using the Lansky.
790589,Ainsley,2013-06-05 11:44:00,142,I use a 1x42 belt grinder and a series of progressively finer belts up to a compound loaded leather one. I should add that I make my own knives so the investment in the machine and belts is worth it for me. Before that I used the spyderco sharpener and was moderately happy with it.

The restaurant owner would send the knives off to get ""professionally sharpened"" by Nella, but they were not as sharp as I was able to get them with the back of a ceramic plate. If you got an old ceramic dish laying around, give it a shot and see for yourself."

790637,FloatnFly,2013-06-05 15:55:00,1640,"  only thing with that, is it says it ""sharpens like a butchers steel"", well, steels aren't for sharpening knives, they're for straightening the blade an honing between sharpenings, even using a product like this, eventually your knife will get to a point where it just won't hold and edge, and you'll have to use either a stone or belt.  I have been a butcher for the last 15 years, and also sharpen my own knives."
790642,T-Bone,2013-06-05 16:49:00,160," My understanding is that a steel fine tunes an already sharp knife...used right before you're ready to start carving to fine-tune that good edge. I've used this system to take knives that would be considered 'dead' in any drawer and return them to extremely sharp, knick-free blades. I would guess most people associate a ""butcher's steel"" as the one tool they can relate to sharpen a knive's edge and the company is using that as a catch-all to sell the system. Again...my experience tells me this is WAY more than a steel...it's a whole ""dull to razor's edge"" system.  Good luck..."
790648,SylvanOwner,2013-06-05 18:00:00,266,"I'm kinda' reading into your original post a bit but one suggestion I would have is to not wait until your blade is dull but instead hone the edge every time you use it.  This will help build and maintain a consistent angle.  I use a lansky and I also use one of the red Rapala handheld ""dohickies"".  I use the Rapala one the most and use it every time I use the knife (also a Rapala....they're good and inexpensive), always 2-5 swipes on the rough edge and then 2 or 3 with the fine side.  If I'm doing a lot of fish then I'll touch up the blade at intervals, usually just the fine side.  My thoughts on angle are that it is very important, but not tha there is one that is right for every knife and every application.  Angle seems to be a trade-off.  The more acute the angle, the sharper the edge that is possible but also requires more maintenance.  The less acute the angle, the less sharp it can be made but it is more durable.  I like the filet knife very acute (and sharp) but a bread knife doesn't need to be like this.  If you constantly use different methods you will likely be changing the angle each time and will not be able to get a good edge.  Find something you are comfortable with, can do well and that you actually will use......stick with it.  disclaimer:   there are people who have already posted that doubtless have more practical experience than I ever will but this works for me"

790669,aplumma,2013-06-05 20:01:00,6896,I found the issue with the Lasky system is it sharpens only one side of the knife and the guide is so wide that it allows for poor angle control. The angle of a knife is very dependant on it's use. A boning knife is trained at 18 degrees while a butcher knife is 24 degrees and a cleaver 28 degrees. A well trained knife is one where the edges  are even and the spine is in line with cutting edge. A sharp knife that is done on a course stone will feel sharp but it has a tearing motion like microscopic edges which is good in most cases that people use a knife in. A polished blade down to the micron level does not tear but cleanly cuts thru the material like a scalpel. This edge is more for show knifes or fine cuts such as sushi knifes and a few of the other chefs knifes that have some really pricey price tags. The grinder methods or belt sanders are good for the tearing type of cutting blades if you want a quick and fast edge on cheap knifes. The down fall of them is they generate heat and pull the temper out of the knife so resharpening is needed more often. Because of the fast removal of material they also are easy to get the spine and the edge out of alignment making for a knife that over time is labor intensive to correct. The friction disc sharpeners rely on pulling off a layer of metal in a predetermined angle and as they wear they lose the angle and you lose the advantage of the specific angles needed for different cutting jobs. The plate method works well for those who have the knack and need to refresh the edge similar to what a steel can do. The steel is basically a tool to remove a burr or rolled edge from a blade that was used on an unforgiving cutting board. I personally advise only wood cutting boards and separate boards for meat and vegetables. I will also say that very few people need a knife as well trained and sharp as what you can accomplish with the wicked edge but if you get past the price you will not be disappointed by the end results.
