790493,Handlebarz,2013-06-05 00:14:00,3790,I bought a split grip three years ago and love it. I can not say why I love it but I know when I use my full grip rods it sure does seem weried
790511,porkpie,2013-06-05 01:03:00,2521,"I like em both, and have plenty of full handles, and a good few split grips!  They all have a place in my boat from time to time!"
790557,mercman,2013-06-05 02:34:00,7054,"I have to agree with Spiel on this one. The price of cork has sky rocketed over the years, and this is most definately a way of saveing production money, and increaseing profit.Personally though, i like the look and feel of split grip rods for most applications. My arsenal is a mixture of both.Split for casting and trolling, full for jigging and drop shoting.The full grip for these last technics, allows me to comfortabley hold the rod in different places so the my arm and hand dont fatigue as quickly."
790568,Henricus,2013-06-05 03:25:00,118,"In cold temps the split grip isn't a problem but I have to agree with the rib pain in warmer weather when wearing only one layer.  I have the split grip sling blade and the truth is I much prefer my full grip Loomis.  Marketing tells me St Croix is the way to go - experience with both tells me otherwise.  If you are going to spend the money make sure you take the Pepsi challenge, you might be surprised."
790734,esoxansteel,2013-06-06 01:42:00,1307,"The guru of rod builders has the correct answer to the question  Corks rings are expensive, and eliminating cork saves companies money, eliminating cork altogether saves more money, hence the eva foam. Reps and Pro-staff will tell you a whole bunch of ideas on why its better, cause they are payed to, but in the long run, its your decision, and your decision should be solely based on your preference, but the lightness thing that they talk about is really a non-issue and something you will not even notice especially on a musky rod as your only talking in grams."
790421,JoshS,2013-06-04 20:08:00,729,Thought I'd get a little debate going over this as I'm in the market for a new combo. What does everyone prefer and why?  
790424,lew,2013-06-04 20:44:00,12766,"I've always used full grip musky poles, mostly Premiers, Avids and Compres, but liked the looks of the new St. Croix Legend Tournament rods with the split grip. I went down to Gagnons a year ago and spent alot of time looking at the 8' model and really liked the feel of it so I bought it.  I paired it up with a Calcutta TE and it is, without a doubt, the best musky set-up I have ever used.  Not saying the split grip makes the difference, but to me it just feels good."
790426,Raf,2013-06-04 20:55:00,3495,"it'll be a matter of how it feels to you.. so go into a store, put the same reel you own on one and try it out  they are slightly lighter than a full grip, but really when you're dealing with the weight of a muskie combo it is negligable.  other than feel, there's no advantage one way or the other."
790427,lew,2013-06-04 20:59:00,12766," Your 100% correct about the weight Raf, but for me personally, I just liked the way it balanced with the reel and the overall feel of the whole combo."

790430,jedimaster,2013-06-04 21:05:00,3472,How do the split grips fit in your rod holders? That's my concern with split grips for musky. Just feels like the full handles will be better long term for wear and tear in and out of the holders.
790432,JoshS,2013-06-04 21:17:00,729,"Thanks Lew.. I actually read your post on that combo when I was doing some searching through old OFC posts earlier today. Looks like a sweet setup.  The rod I'm getting is the Lone Ranger St Croix Legend 8.5ft MH 3/4-3oz. I've handled both split grip and full and the split grip feels nicer. My issue with split grip is bruised ribs! The rod will be used 85% of the time for lighter bucktails, spinnerbaits, topwater, which split grip is a fine choice for. BUT I also throw cranks on this setup and some I like to fish like a jerkbait, on split grip I end up with a sore side after a day of fishing. So 85% of the time the split grip will be nicer... 15% of the time I'll have a sore side. My solution is a combo strictly for jerkbaits only but not in the budget for this year."
790434,Gregoire,2013-06-04 21:23:00,1397,I love split grip rods for casting as Lew said the combos just feel right. As far as the rod holder goes I just use my old full grip rods for trolling.
790435,lew,2013-06-04 21:24:00,12766," OK, I'm missing something here Josh, why would a split grip hurt your sides while fishing jerkbaits but a full grip doesn't ??"
790437,lew,2013-06-04 21:28:00,12766," Alot of the musky guys, me included,  use the DownEast holders for trolling so the grips don't really come into play. It's basically just the part of the rod below the reel that sit's in the holder.  Can't really speak of any other kind of holder myself."
790438,JoshS,2013-06-04 21:32:00,729," I won't be trolling with it. I'd get full for that.  I have both split grips and full and I definitely like the split grip better for casting straight retrieve lures like bucktails. They do feel nicer to me than full grips.  However I also like to throw lighter cranks like depthraiders on this combo that I like to fish really erratically with sharp rips. I use a similar split grip rod to the lone ranger for that application now and it kills the ribs after a few hours of ripping the depthraider.  However I'll be mainly using it for bucktails, spinnerbaits, topwaters so I think I'm going split and will just have to get a designated jerkbait rod down the line."
790439,JoshS,2013-06-04 21:34:00,729, The exposed blank smacks against your ribs when using jerkbaits as opposed to the cork which cushions the impact.  Anyone else get this?
790443,Spiel,2013-06-04 21:39:00,9065,"I've said this before and I'll say it again, ""split grips"" are nothing more than a marketing gimmic to save pennies on manufacturing costs with no real advantages that I can find after 38 years of rod building.  Pros, extremely limited.  Cons, many. Obvious one for musky rods, putting it into your your rod holder."
790444,Roy,2013-06-04 21:42:00,13728, He probably tucks it up under his arm for the retrieve?
790446,Andrew Grant,2013-06-04 21:48:00,201,.
790447,Pigeontroller,2013-06-04 21:51:00,2793,"Call me 'gimmicky' but I like the Split-Grips, all my Muskie amd Bass casting rods are split grips...Why? I like the look, and feel..."
790449,Pigeontroller,2013-06-04 21:52:00,2793,14-16 hours days???!!!  I'd be surprised if I fish more than 6-8 and thats on a fishing dedicated trip.
790450,JoshS,2013-06-04 21:54:00,729, That's it Roy. What Andrew said above sums it up pretty good. It only happens with ripping baits to the side and banging your ribs all day. A shorter jerkbait rod that doesn't smack the water on rips would be the ticket.
790451,lew,2013-06-04 21:55:00,12766," I've got 40 years of casting for muskies under my belt Chris and IMHO, the split grip that I'm currently using for bucktails and spinnerbaits feels much better than any other rod I've used. Maybe it's the split grip that works., or maybe not, but to me it's perfect and if and when I buy another musky pole, it'll probably be exactly the same as this one.  But again, that's just me."
790455,Spiel,2013-06-04 22:02:00,9065,"Some like, some don't, I don't!  To each their own and I can accommodate all and I always have. I'm just expressing an opinion on how it's all about pennies saved to increase profit not function."
790457,JoshS,2013-06-04 22:07:00,729,"It may be a marketing that has sold split grip rods and saved manufacturers money but it's not 100% a gimmick. They do have their advantages and make sense... like the way you are forced to hold the rod for longer/easier casts, a little saving on rod weight, nicer feel and balance. For bass and walleye, they seem to feel nicer, lighter, more sensitive. Damn those big fishing companies have me brainwashed!"

790467,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-04 22:45:00,535,"I use both, I like the split grip but it doesn't really matter, doesn't help you catch any more fish lol.While on the subject of musky rods, St. Croix legend tournament rods are a dream to use."
790469,kickingfrog,2013-06-04 22:49:00,8333,I'm pretty traditional for some things. Full cork grips are my preference.
790471,BillM,2013-06-04 23:03:00,17367,"Full cork or nothing for me.  Split grips are awful looking as well, lol."
