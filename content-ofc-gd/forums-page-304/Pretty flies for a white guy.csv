790893,adolson,2013-06-06 18:08:00,783,"I don't really know anything about flies or fly fishing, but I have these... They look better (to me) than the Danielson brand flies I see at Canadian Tire, and that's the only selection I saw in town last I checked (though I missed the actual tackle shop, as they were closed).  Anyhow, let's say I were to acquire a fly rod and some knowledge on casting and fishing, would these be any good to use for trout (any more effective than other flies such as the Danielsons or whatever)?  Or should I just keep them as memorabilia (they were my grandfather's) and pass them down to my son? It looks like a full set in this little metal tin. The only wording on the outside says ""Fly Box.""

790897,misfish,2013-06-06 18:37:00,29133,Don't give or sell them away. Nice little treasure Dana. I have one of those old green tins too.
790898,bare foot wader,2013-06-06 18:38:00,1354,"I'd keep those as memorabilia  no doubt you could catch a trout or two on some of those flies, but they are far from what I'd call a well tied fly, and nothing wrong with that, they have great sentimental value especially if your grandfather tied them....IMO they would be a great gift to pass down to your kid and should be preserved that way  any more pics of that fly box? is it stamped anywhere? pic of the fly box logo?"
790902,adolson,2013-06-06 19:09:00,783,"I don't think he tied them himself, but I don't know for sure.  Here's the outside of the box.  "
790903,davey buoy,2013-06-06 19:19:00,5505,"Nice collection,my grandfather left me a tin of fly's,probably 60 plus years old.He passed 30 years ago,and we were close .Never saw him use these at least the last 25 years he was around. Similar to what you have but will never use them. They sure look nice,tempting though I must say.Too eaches own.Really don't know if there is much value anyway. Just a keepsake."
790918,adolson,2013-06-06 20:23:00,783,"Yeah, I wouldn't want to sell them. My uncle says these are from the 50s. Use or keep."
790919,Sinker,2013-06-06 20:33:00,8692,I'd be proudly displaying them somewhere that everyone could see them!  S.
790931,fish_fishburn,2013-06-06 21:28:00,1311,Put them in a small shadowbox frame with a pic of your grampa. I can do that for you. I was in the framing business for 20 yrs and still have all my equipment and still do it as a hobby now.
790935,Musky or Specks,2013-06-06 21:35:00,2710,"Those are, ""pretty flies for a white guy"" You could say they are ""Straight Outta Cobalt"" The yellow and fusia ones are are variant of a mickey finn streamer and should work quite well in the brook trout lakes Dana."
790961,Christopheraaron,2013-06-06 23:15:00,3525,"Don't fish them, you can see that the knots are coming apart. I'd definitely keep them, the hooks themselves are actually quite interesting, I'm sure more valuable than the flies. If you want to fish them I'd agree with Brad, fish those streamers, the wet flies won't be of too much use in lakes."
