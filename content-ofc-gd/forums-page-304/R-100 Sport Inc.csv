790163,SlowPoke,2013-06-03 17:15:00,2984,"Fishboch confirms what I've often wondered when I first saw those sport track adapters. I see the stress my 8""+ gunwales take with my riggers/track and I can only imagine the damage being caused over time. Tall risers aren't a good solution either unless their to each other or to the gunwales.  This would solve the problem... and since money is no object when it's time to rig out the boat... lol http://berts-tackle.shptron.com/p/8ft-downrigger-board-w-2-6tracks-2-risers-and-2-end-caps?pp=8"
790177,Terry,2013-06-03 18:59:00,14456,"well I bought the Traxtech  18 "" track for my downriggers with  3  per track, protrack brackets  if the T brackets don't hold I can screw the Traxtech  18 "" track right to the gunwales"
791160,Terry,2013-06-07 21:17:00,14456,sure have spent a lot and the boat  hasn't even arrived yet

789517,Roy,2013-05-31 08:34:00,13728,"If I heard bad stuff about that place it would be the first time. If it'll put your mind at ease and if it's not too late, I can take a run out there and buy them for you and ship them off to you from my place? It's only a 40 minute highway run from my place."

789823,misfish,2013-06-01 18:20:00,29133,Good to hear bud. I got that nylon you were asking about.
789827,Terry,2013-06-01 18:26:00,14456,"great, if we ever get out fishing I will grab it......if a boat show up or the river drops and clears up"
789836,Roy,2013-06-01 19:17:00,13728," No worries, Glad it worked out for you Terry. I hope the stuff is as good as you expect it to be."
790033,Fishboch,2013-06-02 21:48:00,9,Well looks like everything worked out for you. Just saw this post and I did the same thing earlier this spring. I too was looking for a solution for my new Lund. I dealt with these guys strictly through emails. Did the bank transfer thing and was a little skeptical too but everything worked out fine. They had to order some parts before the could fill my order but once they had everything they let me know and it was here in two days. The only problem was the manufacturer's claim. Not sure what boat you have or what application you are trying to setup but I was trying to setup downriggers on my 1775 Impact. Traxtech claimed a 24 inch would be good enough for downriggers. I tried them when the gear arrived and there's just too much torque on the gunnels. I'm getting some custom risers built that will mount to the floor for the riggers and the Traxtech system will be used strictly for my rod holders when trolling for musky.
790034,Terry,2013-06-02 21:53:00,14456,"dang, where  were you yesterday when I needed you..........lol  oh well, ordered now"
790056,Dan668,2013-06-03 00:14:00,1120,Walleye central is a great place to ask questions on lunds. Lots of impact owners there. What electRonics are you putting on your new rig?
790058,Terry,2013-06-03 00:20:00,14456,yeah I read a few posts about these things on Walleye central and people seemed to think they were good but the lund ones were too weak for downriggers
