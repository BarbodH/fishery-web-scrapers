My buddy Grant and I were giggling like school girls when we did the math, two 53's a 52 and a 51 incher.  2 hours fishing, 4 good casts and 209 inches of Gar....all sight fished on new favorite Gar bait.  Jackall Cherry 0 footer.  Quality hooks right outta the package!  Grants new PB.        This last one was a pig, it looked like it ate a cormorant.  21 inch girth and the heaviest gar I've ever caught.  Tipped the digital scale well over 22 lbs.     A few more pics of this wild couple hours fishin are here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1227  RJ"
790509,Locnar,2013-06-05 00:54:00,645,"Congrats on the beauty fish! Gars are some beautiful prehistoric beasts... Definitely one of my bucket fish, along with bowfin."
790513,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-05 01:05:00,535,"Those are huge! I saw a ton of them the last couple of days while musky fishing. Even had a couple inspect my sledge before swimming away, but none were even close to that big!"
790515,Handlebarz,2013-06-05 01:09:00,3790,That is totally awesome congrats
790521,kickingfrog,2013-06-05 01:19:00,8333,"That is one fish that I still need to check off my list, and now I've got a boat to do it in."
790561,fishsevern,2013-06-05 02:50:00,112,"Those are big gar, wow. I've seen a couple decent ones over 30"" this year. Neither even looked at my bait cruising by. One swam under the boat, no fear of man it seemed. Caught a small one at the grand river once off minnow."
790567,Joey,2013-06-05 03:17:00,9122,"Wow, congrats, what a beauty!"

790728,Rich Nelson,2013-06-06 01:18:00,332,Very cool!
790732,Chappee,2013-06-06 01:27:00,10,Amazing fish lads! That 22lb would be the ontario record would it not RJ ahhhh you already hold that title.... Your a hard act to follow.
790736,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-06 02:16:00,8243,"Ok, your photoshop skills are amazing. I'm jealous. Jackall Cherry O, never heard of one or seen one until tonight. Am going out to Bills Bait tomorrow I hope the guys have them.  They look like they would be great for Bass.  Great fish and it looks like a great bait as well. Which one did you use the 48 or 52 or ? While I'm at it what colour as well? Can't hurt asking."
791069,lhousesoccer,2013-06-07 13:48:00,442,"Nice gar!  How do you get the hooks to stick in their bony bill?  All the hits I get never result in hook-ups.  As soon as they open their mouth, the hooks just fall out. Can't penetrate that bone."
791073,mattyk,2013-06-07 14:05:00,2110,Very nice!
791080,mistaredone,2013-06-07 14:39:00,913,Great pics
791157,RJackson,2013-06-07 21:11:00,113,"Thanks folks, it's been a weird spring in Eastern Ontario but still managing to find those special windows of good conditions.   No photoshopping needed for these ones!  I tied on the Jackall Cherry 0 footer 56 in Tenesee Shad at seasons start and it hasn't come off since.  RJ"
