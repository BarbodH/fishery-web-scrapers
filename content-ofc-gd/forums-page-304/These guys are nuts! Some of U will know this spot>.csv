791000,Musky or Specks,2013-06-07 01:44:00,2710,Yep I've fished there too and you feel like you definately don't want to fall in.
791016,NAW,2013-06-07 02:22:00,4022,"That's awesome.  Fished near there.  But to honest, I had no idea those falls where there.  Gunna have to check it out!!"
791017,Rod Caster,2013-06-07 02:23:00,5784,"""now that's how you run it"". haha . That was intense. The first guy had the best run"
791024,Joey,2013-06-07 03:44:00,9122,"Wow, crazy stuff."
791032,fishindevil,2013-06-07 07:31:00,6254,Wow !!!! That's intense ...
791055,Rich,2013-06-07 12:23:00,3927,Awesome!!
791072,SirCranksalot,2013-06-07 13:57:00,3291,"Wow! Not sure why they bothered with PFDs, though----extra padding I guess?"
791083,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-07 15:00:00,4399,Well when one of them cracks their melon on a rock the PFD will keep their body afloat for easier recovery.

Notice the yellow first aid kit on a rock on the left bank? Maybe your supposed to grab it on the way bye.  Now if this was an event in the summer Olympics I would actually watch, these guys are the real deal kayakers."
791100,woodenboater,2013-06-07 16:44:00,2277,Paddlers running extreme gnar will almost always be in high volume boats vs slicey playboats. The volume keeps the nose from diving and possibly pinning. The wood at the end is actually the scary part as a pin there would be VERY problematic.  The music was actually pretty mellow for a kayak video
