That morphed into Babaghanouj (that tasty eggplant dip) and was consequently shortened to 'Ganoosh'.  Jack has taken Ganoosh to mean 'baby'....and he will say....""when i was a Ganoosh(baby)"".  We have been taking him to this little flat rock camping area on the Wabigoon chain of lakes since he was a baby.....so he calls it.....'The Ganoosh Place'   So yesterday morning we were just sitting around....asked Jack what he wanted to do...he said...""why dont we go to the Ganoosh Place"".....off we went.   We got into a pile of hammer handle pike and i got one nice 13"" crappie. Would have liked to have stayed longer, but the crappie were biting shy and concentration and patience was going to be needed to unlock their 'lockjaws'. With Jack in the boat, lunch to cook and a nap for everyone before night shifts the crappie escaped closer scrutiny.   We had a great lunch, a mini adventure in the woods, and headed home, great 3 hour outing.                       pg.html][/url]                                                      Absolutely love summer! Hope for more camping adventures in the future.    "
