He said for anyone that wasn't there, it would be difficult to imagine all the ships coming in and the unbelievable number of fighters & bombers flying overhead.  It was a proud day for all involved.  This was my Dads ship.  "

790855,mercman,2013-06-06 15:41:00,7054,"We Canadians are known world wide as a polite, laid back, and content population. Never argueing, or stirring trouble with the world. Every where we go, we Canadians are loved and treated like royalty.But when asked of us, and when the chips are down, there are no more fierce and determined soldiers in the entire world.Where ever we have been asked to defend or attack, we have been victorious. I am proud of all Soldiers, but Canadian Soldiers are in my heart forever.  "
