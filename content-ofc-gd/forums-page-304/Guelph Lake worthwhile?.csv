790543,Shloim,2013-06-05 01:58:00,515,Was thinking of hitting it in my canoe?  Any recommendations would be appreciated?
790552,chris.brock,2013-06-05 02:14:00,4053,"this is 20 years ago, but it would cough up the odd 12 pound pike  not relevant but anyways-  I remember walking a trail back to my car, just after dark, head down to follow the dim trail, when I walked right into a giant buck, it snorted so loud I nearly filled my pants and had my heart stop, it stood it's ground as I bolted like a scared rabbit"
790566,Fishaholic,2013-06-05 03:16:00,22,"Guelph lake has a bit of everything. Pike, bass, crappie, perch, and a fair number of carp.Electric motor only, so fishing pressure is far less from the GTA crowd then say Belwood. Nice camping/beaches as well.I've never been skunked there, smallmouth/largemouth in 3lb range, snot rockets, a nice population of perch/crappie (Big crappie).I def like it as a day trip if you live in GTA area.Water levers later on in the summer can be quite low, as it is a reservoir and likley affects the fishing some. Used to have ice fishing there."
