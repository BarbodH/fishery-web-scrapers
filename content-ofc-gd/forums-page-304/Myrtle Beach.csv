Also does anyone have any tips.  I was going to take a telescopic fishing pole as I don't want to pay for shipping one of my 1pc rods  I will be staying in North Myrtle Beach"
789108,BillM,2013-05-29 14:54:00,17367,As long as you have a state license you should be fine..   A jig with half a shrimp on it will catch you all kinds of stuff.
789121,Freshtrax,2013-05-29 15:24:00,2215,Your going to want a heavy weight rod.  Pick  up a heavy ugly stick or something similar in a 2 pc.  I lived  in Wilmington nc. For a while you never know what your going to catch.
789184,Rizzo,2013-05-29 21:55:00,4754,you never know what you'll get out there...we got a small hammerhead once!
789311,BillM,2013-05-30 12:48:00,17367," Probably a bonnethead shark.  Same family, we catch them down in Florida all the time.  Awesome looking shark!"
789382,jbailey,2013-05-30 16:58:00,866,"and bonnetheads fight harder than any freshwater fish of the same size, its incredible."
789415,BillM,2013-05-30 19:26:00,17367, Anything in salt water fights harder then pretty much anything in freshwater.   Even those little 16in Whitings fight like crazy.
790876,canadabacon,2013-06-06 16:51:00,1,"Just came across the post... today is June 6th so hopefully you will read it. I go to North Myrtle Beach every year. Saltwater licence is $11 for 14 days that can be purchased at Basspro in North Myrtle  Beach. Saltwater fishing allows for 2 rods. You can fish from the beach with the $11 licence or you can fish from piers (Apache pier is in North Myrtle beach and the longest one). Pier admission price ($8/day) includes licence. In terms of fishing rods, for $20-30 you can get a 2 piece 14 ft surf rod from Bass Pro. I mostly catch sharks on the beach in front of the hotel and from the pier. Scared the crap out of people when I pulled out a 4-5 foot shark in front of the hotel. Some people don't know there are sharks there... go figure Have a good trip!"
