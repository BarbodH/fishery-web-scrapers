788955,aplumma,2013-05-28 22:45:00,6896,I would P.M. T.J. he has lots of reviews on lodges and has been to quite a few of the Northern Lodges.   Art
788959,FloatnFly,2013-05-28 23:04:00,1640,"personaly, i've always wanted to go to lake of the woods, so this is where i would go  http://www.bignorthlodge.com/fishing.html"
788997,craigdritchie,2013-05-29 01:10:00,1586,If money was no object I would be fishing in Manitoba or Saskatchewan. Both have pike and walleye fisheries that will beat anything in Ontario.
789000,Fang,2013-05-29 01:21:00,1330,"My vote would be Big Sand Lake. It's been 5 years since I was there and it left such an impression. The fishing was out of this world as well as the staff, location, scenery,...... the list just is too long  Moose sightings every day, shore lunch to die for  about the only thing not there for a ten year old is a lounge area with TV or video games. Let's be honest a week without any of that would be hard on any kid."
789025,beagle dad,2013-05-29 02:12:00,224,Knee lake lodge....everything except musky available
789028,Shloim,2013-05-29 02:23:00,515,I would without a doubt do a fly in trip in northern Ontario. Lake of the woods is apparently unbelievable... But take note that the bugs are in season and likely out of control!
789029,Whopper,2013-05-29 02:25:00,2174,Lac Seul and hire Ben Beattie for a week. Not that far as others have suggested and has everything your asking for
789043,Loadman,2013-05-29 04:05:00,63,Great Bear or Slave lakes..... you will pay though....
789051,glen,2013-05-29 06:42:00,2641,Labrador. I am planning a trip right now.
789054,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-29 07:22:00,8243,"I would choose Nippissing. Close to TO and the outfitters there could use our support. If money really isn't any object check out Klotz Lake Camp. It's near Longlac. Fly to Thunder Bay, rent a vehicle and get ready for an adventure of a lifetime. One can drive into many back lakes on the old Kimberly Clark logging roads. Portage the rapids to Flint Lake with a 14 foot aluminum. 2 at a time walleye on a pickerel rig, fill the boat with perch, put on a good old fashioned Red Devil and hold on for dear life when a 20 plus pound Northern hits it. While you ice down your sore wrist and elbows from reeling in trophy pike, watch the Black Bears and Moose do what Black Bears and Moose do.  And you can do all this in sunlight until 10:30 PM. Snowball fight in the morning and shorts and t shirts at noon. Pretty amazing for a 30 year old Ironmaker that had never been in the woods north of Dundas. Now I hear they have a TV! I can't imagine why for the life of me.  I miss the real north, forget about Sask and Manitoba. That's all trick photography and besides this the Ontario Fishing Network. Who want's to go to Klotz next June?"
789057,fishindevil,2013-05-29 07:54:00,6254,I'm with Craig Ritchie on the northern sask probly tobin lake the lakes up there are world class and all have the potential to hold record walleyes and pike it's some of the best fishing in the world for those 2 species !!!! Come on Craig lets go !!!! I will hook up the Lund right now.....lol
789100,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 14:24:00,3970,"Ontario...?  Some incredible fisheries across this Province from drive-to to fly-in.  Too many ideas to list really... especially with that recipe of fish species.  But from Chicago area I'd think NW Ontario would be as easy a choice for travel as anywhere else in the Prov, and that'd open up a tonne of options yet to be explored, especially on the muskie front.  Have a buddy from Wisconsin that comes up each year and has fished different NW Ontario spots and almost too many amazing arctic Canada fisheries for lakers and pike.  If you'd ever want suggestions for that, I could certainly ask Seth about any places you're thinking about.  Do have some favorites for ON though, a list which keeps growing with age."
789111,BillM,2013-05-29 15:05:00,17367,Hard to beat NW Ontario.
789112,troutologist,2013-05-29 15:07:00,951,"Scott Lake Lodge on the SK/NWT border. Unreal pike, lakers and grayling and they are adding a walleye lake this year.  One of the best in the business."
789116,davew3,2013-05-29 15:14:00,430,Why not try a train in.  Drive to Sudbury then take the train to a lodge.  Check out this link.   Also you could always check out Science North in Sudbury.  http://www.northtoadventure.com/
789157,dylan21,2013-05-29 19:23:00,22,"Slippery Winds wilderness resort in NW Ontario. Got all of your listed fish. Lakers, bass, musky, pike, walleye.  http://www.gwnlodges.com/Slippery_Winds/Slippery_Winds.html"
791028,camillj,2013-06-07 07:02:00,1988,Thanks for all the advice fellas ...much appreciated
791062,MrSimon,2013-06-07 13:20:00,217,"It depends on you and your son.  If you want amazing fishing and a true wilderness adventure, then get an outfitter to fly you into a private camp on a small to medium sized lake.  It really is as good as it gets .... but its also quite the undertaking and might not be a good idea for a 10 year old's first trip.  The other option is to find a good, reputable drive-to lodge in NW Ontario on a big lake.  I recommend one that has a few bush lakes you can access for a day trip.  You and your son will have a great time staying in a cabin, talking with the other guests, exploring the lake(s) etc etc.  Oh, and spending a lot of money is not synonymous with having the best experience.  A ""true Ontario experience"" means roughing it a little bit and un-plugging for a while."
791070,SirCranksalot,2013-06-07 13:49:00,3291,"The Borgerman knows all sorts of great places in NW Ont., if you can get his attention. I know folks who have gone to Esnagami Lodge and caught lots. There's lots of info on the net re Esnagami."
791081,fishnsled,2013-06-07 14:42:00,3520,Well if money is no option then NW Ontario - Lake of the Woods and hire Gord Pyzer as your guide for the week.  One of the most knowledgeable fisherman I've had the pleasure of fishing with.  Ben Beattie on Lac Seul would be another great choice.
