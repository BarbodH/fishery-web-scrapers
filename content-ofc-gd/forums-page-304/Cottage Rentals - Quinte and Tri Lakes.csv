Does anyone know of any places that have good accomodations and will do per day rentals vs. an entire week? I'm only looking to go to each place on a Thurs-Sun trip.  For the Quinte trip, I'm looking to stay in the Belleville/Trenton/Deseronto area and for Tri-Lakes, I have no preference right now.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
