450263,fishnsled,2010-03-31 03:35:00,3520,I wish that option was available on my previous boat. Might have been cheaper then the divorce.
450270,Syn,2010-03-31 04:05:00,519,I was waiting for him to hook her red top with a backcast.
450271,skeeter,2010-03-31 04:08:00,1907,that is great. wonder how much it would cost?
450273,Dondorfish,2010-03-31 04:35:00,1000,  I'll let you know when the bill comes in - I had it installed on the passenger seat of the Tracker.
450279,okumasheffield,2010-03-31 05:58:00,318,I thought girlfriend is the optional accessory ...
450285,solopaddler,2010-03-31 08:53:00,8605,Hmmm..if I had to choose between the Nitro and her I'd pick the girl. Earplugs are dirt cheap y'know.
450301,backbay,2010-03-31 10:52:00,773,"Been there, done that. I'll take the boat!"
450316,kickingfrog,2010-03-31 11:59:00,8333,I guarantee that the boat is cheaper... and would last longer.
450319,Sugarpacket,2010-03-31 12:08:00,82,that was great!
450337,Roy,2010-03-31 12:54:00,13728,"Yes it is kinda funny but I find it strange that he would dislike someone enough to sit her down on an eject seat. After all, with the billions of potential female partners out there, he's the one who selected her. Gotta wonder about the dude's mental stability....also about the company who would choose an ad agency who would even propose the ad. Things that make you go hmmmmm....."

450349,backbay,2010-03-31 13:10:00,773,"Lolz, that's pretty funny! Wonder if it was the same ad agency??"
450365,fish-miester,2010-03-31 13:56:00,864,haha
450416,Terry,2010-03-31 16:32:00,14456,the guy was stupid he had to know the water was to shallow to drown the be-uch
450418,Roy,2010-03-31 16:33:00,13728,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
