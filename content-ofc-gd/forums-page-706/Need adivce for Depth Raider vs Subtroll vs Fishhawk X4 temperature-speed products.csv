449803,Randy,2010-03-30 11:14:00,115, I have been using the Cannon speed and depth with the coated cable for the past 4 years or so. I tried using the regular cable but I kept losing signal deeper than 40'. With the coated cable I don't have that problem.  The coated cable that came with the unit was rated for 135 lbs compared to the 150 lbs for the uncoated. Since I bumped up the weight of my ball I also got a 150 lb Moor coated cable.  The Cannon unit not only provides speed and temperature but it also tells you the depth of the ball and the amount of light at that depth.  I'm not sure of the unit that uses a transducer instead of the cable to return the signal if the transducer will interfer with your generously proportioned transducer.

This was back in the nineties and technology has changed since then but I found the sub troll to be a bit Mickey Mouse and way to cumbersome to use. I then purchased the fishhawk and it performed well. I have heard good reports also on the cannon line of products.
