450000,mistaredone,2010-03-30 19:46:00,913,Looking to get the boat out this weekend as the weather look amazing!  Just wondering what my options are?  Zone 17 pike?  Frenchmans bay?  Canal or Mitchell ice out yet?  Zone 16/20 perch?  Simco fishable?  I know Erie is an option but I wouldnt know where to start.  Anything open lower Niagra?

450024,Terry,2010-03-30 20:38:00,14456,if you meant simcoe most areas still have lots of ice some canals and rivers and the bottom of cooks bay has an open area by strawberry island has an open spot but most of simcoe is not fishable I have been trying to getr real reports about the ice on Canal or Mitchell but have not heard
