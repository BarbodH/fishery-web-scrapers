About 3 years ago I replace my Minn Kota trolling motor on my front deck...first time out the darn thing ran BACKWARDS...and YES I had the wiring correct...when I got home I triple checked everything out again then called Minn Kota...after a reasonable amount of waiting on the phone I got a lady tech who help me trace the problem down...from the factory (China, Mexico who knows) they had THREE wire crossed on the foot control.....been fine ever since."
