450127,solopaddler,2010-03-30 23:49:00,8605,I've owned 2 CRV's and currently an Accord. I've never paid higher premiums ever. Beyond reliability the reason I like Honda is resale. In my experience nothing even comes close..  If you do in fact pay slightly higher premiums for a Civic you'll recoup the loss 10 times over with lower maintenance costs and the high resale.
450151,pikehunter,2010-03-31 00:20:00,1659," SOME of US do care where a car is made, or where everything they buy comes from. For those who wish to help their neighbours out the best they can it does matter. Sure not everything I buy is made here, but if I have the opportunity then why not? Probably the Vibe and Matrix are equal, if pricing is the same then why not buy the Matrix or Civic and be proud of the fact that Canadians can make a decent and well respected product.

This was a first year Matrix and I will admit to paint chip problems , espically around the windshied and back hatch also an ongoing rust stain running from a rear door handle . The car drives very good still , the front end still feels tight ( all original ) everything is still original other then tires and the brake job . I would recommend a matrix with 4 winter tires and wheels and your'll have a great little car for the summer and a fun little tank in the winter . Winter tires are needed as the oringinal tires are wide all seasons and will not work in slush ...at all . Also the Matrix is a little taller so the driver can see more then ie - a civic . The driving position was a little hard to get used to , which could have been corrected with telescopic steering but I don't notice it anymore ."

They are a year old and have the remainder of their long GM WARRENTY remaining . As much as I recommend a matrix ( I payed around 26500 tax in , almost 8 years ago ) and feel that it could easily go 400,000km with alot of highway driving ,it is hard not to look at one of these Cobalts at $8800 that are a year old . I think that they bought 250 of them so you'll have a good pick . They have also bought Gran Prix's and Impalas in the past and they sell them for half price and they are all 1 year old with warrenty . My friend bought an impala for over $30,000 new 9 years ago and said that he got another impala a few months ago at Georgian for around $14,000 , 1 year old . Check their website .

449054,blue pickeral,2010-03-28 10:24:00,267,"Have 3 Toyotas, but not a brand fanatic. A few related ideas that might be helpful:  -there are quite a few 'brand' specific internet forums from which you can find common problems inherent in each car. When researching a Toyota Echo back in 2004, there was so little that went wrong with the cars, some of the female members were posting racy pictures of themselves! A good forum for Toyota is www.toyotanation.com. Enabled me to download all Technical Service bulletins, and as variable speed intermittent wipers are an absolute for me, saved $1,500 learning that a snap in module could be bought for $100, which saved going to the upward 'options' package in which it was included. Also was able to keep track of major changes in models, that as being newly instituted, might not have the 'bugs' worked out yet.  -join the Automobile Protections Agency - www.apa.ca - their new car purchase service enables a pre-arranged no haggle price from dealers with which they have pricing agreements. Bought wife's Corolla through this, and knowing invoice price of a truck before hand enabled good price with a non-APA dealer and better trade in value. Have no experience with CarCostCanada, but many people use this as well. No pre-arrange pricing.  -Have heard that the Matrix/Vibe are essentially the same vehicle, so better pricing might be available by a 'go between' dealers. After purchase servicing might be easier having two brand facilities to choose from.  -finding a manual transmission these days might be problematic. Waited 3 months for factory order for truck as no standards on anyone's lots.  -as far as buying North America is concerned, despite the location of assembly - Canada, US, Mexico = most of the parts are from this continent anyway.  -for certain vehicles where the warranty is 'no haggle' throughout North America (check the APA web site) you may be able to buy an extended warranty from a US dealer for less than half the Canadian price at time of purchase. For Toyota/Ford owners for instance, a fellow named Troy Dietrich in Greenfield, Mass. sells the authentic (not 3rd party) warranties to Canadians after they have owned the vehicle for 1 year. Purchased a 7 year, 160K, $0 deductible, all inclusive (except for wearable parts)for $950.00 US. Simple process using mail and call in Visa number. A google will bring up the site. (not sure of forum rules with regard to commercial links)"

It's very small and feels very cheap compared to my former company car. I never thought I would miss my '05 Malibu Maxx (it had a few of it's own issues), but I do.  The Chevy was much more spacious, had a much better stereo, much more fun to drive powerwise and just more luxurious all the way around.  The Honda is very tight for space, my buddy is rather large and can barely fit into the passenger seat, his head almost sticks out the sunroof, the factory stereo sounds like crap, the thing is a gutless wonder and sounds like a sewing machine and the car feels altogether cheaply made. Even the mileage is only slightly improved, I would have expected better since the motor is only half the size (1.8L 4 cylinder compared to 3.5L V6).

I'm sure she'll get 200,000 miles on this engine. She gets 35-40 mpg. Those are the pluses. On the negatives, I don't like sitting down so low to the ground and I hate just getting in and out. Once I'm in there is plenty of room for a 6' 200lb+ guy. It is not the most quiet cabin, especially running winter tires. Finally, while nothing of consequence has ever failed, she has had 4 or 5 minor warranty things, 2 switches, a module, a recall, and the like. Bottom line is she really likes her car even after nearly 5 years, and plans to keep it another 2 years minimum. If you put 70K/year on a car why not buy a late model used vehicle and let someone else take the depreciation hit for the first 2 years?  ps.

VW & Audi are the two marques I'll never own, just for reliability reasons alone (forgetting inflated prices, questionable build quality, hell even the OIL that is mandatory has a 150% markup).  I still know people who keep insisting on driving them, but darned if I know why, latest is a friends GTI that was parked for 3 weeks last summer waiting for an ECU to be flown in from Wolfsburg.  If you ask him he'll still tell you his VW is ""pretty reliable"" with a straight face.  I dunno.   There were only two vehicles in the last decade that had every component manufactured in N.America, the Toyota Camry & Crown Victoria.  So if you want to be a patriotic motorist, get busted for street racing in your Camry and hauled away in the back of a Crown Vic  Hybrid Camry's use powertrain components from Asia, but with your mileage they might be worth looking at.

448596,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-27 00:48:00,4399,  Ya but the tip is pokin you in the ear!!LOL
448599,Muskieman,2010-03-27 00:56:00,2472,"    I third that.... but unless you buy it from a chop shop you're not getting a Canadian product. As for being expensive to fix.. not that much more than the average import 10% or so more than the average domestic but breaks 70% less.  But I would second the Focus/Mazda 3.. and not a disguised Daewoo like most GM mid sized ""not the Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix""  Good luck!!  RFS "
448615,BillM,2010-03-27 01:33:00,17367,70k a year?  You'd be crazy not to put a TDI on that list.  522k on my daily driver and it still runs like a top.
448628,Daplumma,2010-03-27 01:58:00,1961,Scion..Great cars.Run forever. Joe
448632,misfish,2010-03-27 02:10:00,29133,"Bought the wife a 2007 Focus 4 dr with low km last year. Great on the pocket book, as far as gas goes.Alittle road noise on the hwy,but other then that.Great car.Very roomy.  New F150 reg cab/short box, is on order for me."
448653,Burtess,2010-03-27 02:50:00,901,"VW is not on the list, though the mileage of a TDI would be nice.  My parents and siblings (and nephew etc.etc.) are VW fans....  I watched my dad pour a litre a week of high end ""VW"" synthetic into his 2007 Passat, VW insisted it was normal consumption.... the 2009 is better... not as reliable as I want unfortunately. Scion??  Can you even buy them in Canada? Burt"
448674,canuckjack,2010-03-27 04:35:00,121,"315K on an '02 Corolla, and until last year it cost me absolutely nothing in repairs...now I'm dealing with clutch issues but they'll get sorted out.  Engine uses a bit of oil, but for the cost of about a litre between each oil change I won't complain.  I'd highly recommend Toyota"
448709,ColdH20guy,2010-03-27 12:09:00,312,We just got an 05 Vibe and love it so far..its AWD as well so we'll see how that is next winter....other car is a Toyota and love that as well..
448713,Tybo,2010-03-27 12:21:00,1373,Why don't you want another Buick?
448729,Burtess,2010-03-27 13:12:00,901," I would love another Buick, the car before this one was a 01 Century, I sold it with ~380K on it.  Did a coil spring and a battery on that one lol... Problem is Buicks are over $30K for all models now, and they got rid of the 3800 V6 (which was my fav).  I need something cheaper and more fuel efficient.... something that fits in better with the mileage the company pays me. But if I could swing it I would buy another in a heartbeat!  Burt"
448737,FUSION,2010-03-27 13:47:00,81,Have you considered looking at a Ford Fusion?
448760,pikehunter,2010-03-27 14:22:00,1659,Matrix: Made in Ontario Vibe:   Made in California Civic:  Made in Ontario Focus:  Made in Mexico  Need I say more?   There are only 2 real options to choose from. But if the Focus is a cheap deal then?
448794,Burtess,2010-03-27 15:42:00,901," I was under the impression that the Focus was assembled in Wayne, Michigan?? If not I would probably scrap that idea as I would like to support Canadian / USA manufacturing...  Burt"
