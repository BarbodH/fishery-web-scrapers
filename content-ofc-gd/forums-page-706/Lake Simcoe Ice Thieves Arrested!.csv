Two individuals pulling a hut with a yellow snowmobile pulled up to him and struck up a distracting conversation for a few minutes. One of the individuals now is known to be 13 years old, the other his ""father"".  They left and soon my friend noticed his cordless drill and auger missing.  As luck would have it, he went back to shore see the culprits loading their sled up. He was able to get a plate number.  He reported this to Police and his drill which was etched with initials was recovered, along with numerous other property in less then 2 weeks.  Many thanks to York Region Police, especially lead officer with the badge number 1094.  If you have further info or have been a victim, contact York Region Police."
