Is this time of the year generally good for pike? Also what are the best ways to target them so we dont catch anything else? Dont want any waleye or muskies on the end of the lines if we can help it.? I would assume any live baits are out?No? was thinking spinners and xraps n such. Any advise would greaty appreacatied.. Sorry for the natsy typing this is being done on my blackberry. Thanks, Guys"
