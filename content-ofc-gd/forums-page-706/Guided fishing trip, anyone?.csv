I would call myself an enthusiastic fisherman with little experience and some success (caught Pike/Bass/Muskie/Walleye from shore). I have always wanted to go on one of those guided fishing trips (here in Northern Ontario). Now that I finally have the time to do it, I am confronted with the most unlikely challenges of all: my friends aren't too keen on spending $1-2k for a week-long all-inclusive guided fishing trip (this is what I found online http://andersonslodge.com/ap1.html let me know if you have any recommendation).  So here is my question, how do you normally organize these trips if your friends aren't super crazy about landing big pikes? Are there places that people meet for these things?  Cheers"
