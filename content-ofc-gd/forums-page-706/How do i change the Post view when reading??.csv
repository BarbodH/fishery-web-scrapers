How do i change it so that it loads all replies on the page automatically like my home computer?"
450422,Governator,2010-03-31 16:39:00,879,The old board use to have an options button to change display views.  Try this:  Click on your username on the top right corner and the click settings.  The last setting on that page should be display view.  Change it to look like a forum not like a list.  Afterwards click save changes.
