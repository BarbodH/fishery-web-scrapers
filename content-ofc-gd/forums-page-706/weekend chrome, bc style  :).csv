449318,spinnerdoc,2010-03-29 01:37:00,556,"tried a couple of times in the winter, and nothing but skunk... well this weekend ended that..i was freezing in hip deep water when the first steelie hit...fought her a bit and was able to get her close to me, thought she was done and as i was trying to net her,  had to drop the rod and kinda hold the middle of the rod to get her close enough to swing the net and i wasnt able to maintain pressure, she twitced and she was off. man i was disappointed. and she swam ever so slowly as if to taunt me.  a fellow angler saw me and was chatting with me a bit on how landing a fish like that is a bit hard esp with a 10.5 foot rod. better off coming to shore and landing it there.i realized why in the hell didn't i think of that....as we were talking i was putting roe on my hook and casted it out and bammmm... a hit ...i told him i'm coming to shore for this one, so i was fighting the fish and watching my step bec where i was, there were deep spots and shallow so had to watch my step....made it to shore and landed the fish. had another hit that day but broke off ,  i didn't tie the knot very well, but over all was a fine day.  i am new to steelheading, so getting tihis much action in a day put a wide grin on my face. now i don't feel bad for the days i have come out empty, it's a blast anyway everytime i get to go out and enjoy fishing and the scenery  here's the beauty that lived to spawn another year "
449323,Leecher,2010-03-29 01:46:00,7832,Awesome spinnerdoc     Sounds like you had a great time out on the river's edge Congrats on landing that beauty     but the link does not work for me.... may be you need to upload the pic to Photobucket and copy / paste the pic properties into your post.  I'd be nice to see your first!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
449325,spinnerdoc,2010-03-29 01:52:00,556,there i think that's better
449326,Leecher,2010-03-29 01:54:00,7832,Much better  Beauty again congrats
449331,spinnerdoc,2010-03-29 02:09:00,556,"thanks. actually this is my second landed.  i can't find where the first pic, i caught it around early november.  i had to admit fishing in the middle of winter having to manoeuver the float set up to avoid slush and ice..and of course ice on the guides and lines, frozen fingers, slipping a couple of times. in the beginning the floats were cocking nicely but after a while out of whack bec of ice weighing down the float and split shots....well i have no regrets.  man some of the scenery makes up for  all the challenges of winter fishing. tough fishing but worth it.  tight lines"
449421,MJL,2010-03-29 14:37:00,2427,"Nicely done man...BC I'm guessing stands for Baitcaster  That fish is as chrome as can be...If I'm heading down your way, I'll give you a shout for some big water steel."
449446,solopaddler,2010-03-29 15:48:00,8605,Nicely done!
450286,spinnerdoc,2010-03-31 09:06:00,556,"MJL:  let me know in advance i work weekends once in a while.    SOLOPADDLER:  thanks, actually i keyed in on the charteuse roe bags from one of your post...always a wealth of resource. guys like you and mjl make this forum the best"
450287,spinnerdoc,2010-03-31 09:10:00,556,actually the bc part was meant to be bc as in the east coast....but bait cast fits since i was float fishing with my baitcaster...he he... works like a charm...till i get my pin ready this will be my gear....abu record with 10.5fenwick hmx float rod
