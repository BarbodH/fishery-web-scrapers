I had a plate on it before and seemed to work ok,it was a spring loaded one so it came up the faster you went,no cords or anything, worked great untill my buddy back it into a rock pile, and they don t make that one anymroe so can t get parts or fabricate anything, so I am wondering if anyone has an opinion on what kind of plate works best for 75 hp. any ideas would help. i looked at Cabellas, they have afew that might be ok, but not sure of the quality. thanks for any help."
