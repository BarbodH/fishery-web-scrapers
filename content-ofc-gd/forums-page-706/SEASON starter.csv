449806,BITEME,2010-03-30 12:00:00,1968,Well after 3 years of trying to catch trout with a bobber/float Ive decide it just is not my deal so switched back to a spoon with the 13 footer and tagged 3 of these inside 30 min. I no why I hate boober fishing it just dosent turn my yaya. So in case you thought all I do is complain no I do fish just to much effort to post pictures sorry team no sign  Peter

449877,BITEME,2010-03-30 14:36:00,1968,I just like the slam on a moving target better then a bobber plus my ADHD wont allow me to sit and watch a bobber for to long
