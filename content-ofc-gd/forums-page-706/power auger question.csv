The question is is it okay to stay in the box or should i take it out and add some engine storage spray to lube the pistons? Like I said it has never been out of the box. thanks."

They both have a shelf life of 2 years or more.  There would be many seized motors out there if that was not the case.  I'm sure The factory has applied enough agent on the metals for you not to worry about it until it is used."
