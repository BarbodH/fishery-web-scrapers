449263,Beans,2010-03-29 00:02:00,3339,Took a run down by the lake on Saturday at noon...    The sub zero temps Thursday and Friday Nights put a thin shell of ice along the shoreline...With the forecasted temps in the twenties next weekend the ice won't be around much longer...
449279,Leecher,2010-03-29 00:29:00,7832,"Yes Beans the ice won't be around for long.... one of our local lakes up here ""the infamous Casino du Lac Leamy""  has gotten open on the shorelines as I was driving along the highway 50 last Friday  It's just a matter of time now Leechman"
449282,Jer,2010-03-29 00:34:00,1426,The whole lake in front of me is open...except of course for my bay which is locked in pretty solid right now.  I walked over to the point today and fished the open water there a bit...no bites though.  The warm temps this week should do it.
449286,pike slayer,2010-03-29 00:37:00,1177,"i was at the lake infront of my new place yesterday, still fully covered in ice but i wouldnt chance going out there looks like pure slush. wont be long probably 2weeks or so."
449370,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-29 10:06:00,2582,It won't be long beansie. Get your crappie gear ready to go!!!

449537,misfish,2010-03-29 20:08:00,29133,Norm You just need a 12 ft plank and yer off to the races.LOL
449551,Big Cliff,2010-03-29 20:36:00,6899,Lake is wide open out in front of our place but my marine railway is still locked in solid. Really pissed me off to see boats out there today and I wasn't one of them.
449552,Beans,2010-03-29 20:37:00,3339," Thanks for the vote of confidence Jack but, truth be told, I still have to take a reel off my ice-fishing rod, top the 4lb test mono on it with 6 lb. test, walk it all off then reverse it back on the reel so that the unused end of the 4 lb will be on top...  Other than that I'm ready to rock and  roll...  Back in the olden days we used to say ""boogie"""
449554,Beans,2010-03-29 20:39:00,3339, Hey Cliff...wanna borrow my spud...
