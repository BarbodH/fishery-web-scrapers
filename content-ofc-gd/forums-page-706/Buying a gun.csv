Todays young hunters,(EVEN THOSE THAT WISH TO START AT AN OLDER AGE) are not the same as what was brought up back in the day.Yes, there are some that are brought up with the right ways,the respect of the sport and respect thier kill. Many think ,when they get thier lic, guns,they can just shoot anyway they want.(dont start with me, as I have seen it first hand)If you dont see the way society has become today archie,yer as blind as the nonowner/ anties.IT,S NOT THE SAME ANYMORE.

Back on topic though, a 22 250 is a great cartridge as well...and btw I love my 30-06, if it were legal I would use the AR15 for deer hunting though.

450309,scuro2,2010-03-31 11:34:00,904, The waiting time is not a bad thing. My brother applied for a gun license. He was mentally unstable....as did a former coworker who wrote some disturbing stuff on FB about her employer. I'm not totally up on this but I believe you need to supply references. The wait time may very well be so that they have enough time contact references in case there are red flags. Neither of the two people above got their gun license.
450315,Billy Bob,2010-03-31 11:57:00,5865,  When you speak of a gun license in Canada is it the same for the whole country or is this a Ontario license..Also is this gun license for any firearm or do you need something else for a hand gun.
450318,dave524,2010-03-31 12:05:00,4508," They are my favourite too, Bob. Got a stablemate to that one, M77 6MM Rem bull barrel with an old Weaver T-16 on it, year newer, 1976 with the "" Made in the 200th Year of the American Liberty"" stamped into the barrel markings.  Shot a lot of chucks with it, liked it so much I added another M77 , again in 6MM with a sporter barrel for a coyote rifle, then a M77 in 30-06 for big game and still another bull barrel this time in the .220 Swift, continuing with my fondness for Rugers, I'd always admired the No.1 single shot so added a .218 Bee in one of those. Can't have too many varmint rifles, as Warren Page, a benchrest shooting pioneer used to say "" the only interesting rifle, is an accurate rifle"" or something very similar."
450323,Billy Bob,2010-03-31 12:24:00,5865," Nice little collection you have there..  ..I liked my .22-250 Ruger so much that I also purchase a .270 Win in the Bi-Centennial Edition...hey you're not suppose to have one of those up there..  ...That's my deer rifle. Those Ruger #1's are REAL PURRDY. Back in the 70's a neighbor purchased on in a .220 Swift...he had a real hard time finding one. That .220 Swift you have is the only cartridge that can beat out my .22-250......how is ammo up there, especially on the .220 Swift, available or do you reload.  Lately I have purchase a couple of the newer Savages for my son and nephew for deer hunting.......nice gun, especially for the money. With it's free floating barrel and Accu-Triggers it's a hard gun to beat when it comes to accuracy right out of the box. Got my son one in a .243 Win and my nephew one in a 7mm-08 Weather Warrior Model...both shoot clover leafs at 100 yards. My younger son Bill now says he has more time to hunt now that college is finally over so I have a 1969 Savage Model 99 that's in mint condition for him. This is one of the nicest lever actions ever made.  Bob"
450327,Jer,2010-03-31 12:28:00,1426,"  The gun license program is a national thing.  Hand guns are a different animal altogether, near impossible to obtain legally."
450333,OhioFisherman,2010-03-31 12:45:00,6623,"Rattletrap take a look at the ammo prices, a 22 long rifle will work on most small animals, and you won`t put much of a dent in the wallet buying ammo to practice or shoot. Center fire cartridges are much more expensive. Most of your 22 rifles are chambered for 22 longs I wouldn`t mess with shorts, just not as strong. I don`t know what they sell up there, but here you can by 22 subsonics, a much quieter round, not as fast moving though.  A 22 rifle can be very accurate in the hands of a good shooter, and they are popular because of their price and the price of ammo for them. I can shoot in my back yard here in the country and have done so, I have railroad tracks that are 4-5 feet higher than the land at the back of my property a back stop. A 22 will go a long way, some caution is needed if you have neighbors behind you.  a rough idea of ammo prices  http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/browse/browse.aspx?c=96  Neighbors here regularly knock off groundhogs with 22`s, lol and my dog brings their dead bodies home, bad dog! leave it in the neighbors yard. Ground hogs and horses don`t mix well, too many chances for broken legs."
450347,Steel28,2010-03-31 13:08:00,160,  I'm thinking of getting CZ 453 Varmint in .17HMR
450361,dave524,2010-03-31 13:45:00,4508," I reload, need to to get every last bit of accuracy out of a rig. Really the 220 Swift ammo is pretty readily available at most gun shops, but don't expect to find it at Canadian Tire or Walmart here. The tricky one to get is the 218 Bee, with a #1 the best option is to handload as the only ammo made for it is flat tipped bullet stuff suitable for use in tubalar magazines of old Winchester lever guns for which it was originally designed. The #1 allows the use of more efficient spitzer bullets and you can load up to a bit more velocity than what the old lever guns would allow. As a teenager in the 60's I could walk into the local hardware store and come out with a gun and ammo without any ID, do I feel any safer now with the bureacracy and paper work, NOT IN THE LEAST.  The original poster should pick up a Ruger 10-22 in .22 rimfire. Fun gun for the money and lots of cool aftermarket stuff."
450364,bigbuck,2010-03-31 13:54:00,2449,"You can get a handgun here in Canada but you have to have a Restricted PAL. That means getting your regular PAL, joining a recognized shooting club and jumping through a few more hoops. You can get it but it's more difficult and any handgun you buy has to have at least a 4inch barrel otherwise it would be considered a Prohibited weapon. Amazingly enough, I have been to a couple of gun shows with a friend who shoots pistols competitively, you should see the sort of stuff out there. I have seen a Russian 23mm Anti Aircraft gun with ammunition that gets fired every year at a range. That, I don't understand. What on Earth do you need an anti aircraft gun for??? Pistols too for that matter, they are designed to kill people, not animals for hunting purposes. Rifles and shotguns definitely. I am opposed to the Registry. If you take firearms out of the hands of your citizens, you in effect control them and can do whatever you wish because they cannot defend themselves. That is Sociology 101 kids."
450376,suds,2010-03-31 14:34:00,70,"I just when thru all this as I let my PAL lapse ( don't do this!). I would definetely recommend it for the hands on handling of different firearm types. One piece of advice I got was take both portions; un-restricted ( hunting stuff) and restricted ( handguns). The reason was that 5 years down the road the government can decide all firearms are restricted with a stroke of a pen and you are coughing up another $150 bucks and another weekend. The RCMP called everyone of my references, including my wife and asked about 20 questions of each of them- took about a month for the Ontario firearms officer to return my exams and then you forward them to the RCMP out east. That took 2 months.  I thought the firearm courses were good.  The hunter safety course is also worthwhile, although Ontario does not recognise that I have completed one in BC and AB. That is a total cash grab on their part.  good luck  suds"
450389,jedimaster,2010-03-31 15:09:00,3472,"Its funny how the whole thing works, a friend of mine just got his, RCMP called me and asked me if I knew him and thats was it. Another guy I know they never even called his wife. Some people get the 20 questions. There is no way to catch everyone. When I got mine about 6 or 7 years ago they never called a single reference of mine. Yep it is federal its across canada. Dito on getting the restricted if you can, you might as well. Its known as RPal to the gun enthusiasts."
450405,Billy Bob,2010-03-31 15:58:00,5865,"They're not only using all this licensing for control but for a LOT of revenue....think about it..I can without any of your gun classes, gun license come into Canada with my rifle or shotgun to hunt...I am except from all your requirements that a resident needs just to own a gun because I am coming into your country to spend money...this is also true when I bring my boat into Ontario...I don't need no course or boating card because I am going to spend money there...double standard or what."

Can anyone tell me what the current steps are required to do this?  I'm assuming I would need to take a course(s) to obtain a Firearms Acquisition Certificate? Is this still the rule? What is a PAL? I think I read about this somewhere.  I have never owned a gun or had any of these permits.  Also, where would i go to obtain these things? Is there a course online or anything?  Thanks"
449864,BUSTER,2010-03-30 14:04:00,1336,"BASS PRO offers the one stop program, hunter safty and firearm course, usually around $275-300 the one i took was friday night 5-10pm saturday 8-7pm and sunday was 8-5 but I was first to do the practical and got out around 1pm sunday...super easy"
449866,BITEME,2010-03-30 14:06:00,1968,Yeah what he said after all the farting around you are probbably looking at 5 bills
449873,DANIMAL,2010-03-30 14:25:00,215,And after doing the course it takes a good 2 months for your application to be prossesed. I've been waiting about a month for mine.
449875,Rattletrap2,2010-03-30 14:35:00,1652," Thanks guys. After doing some more reading, I see that a PAL is a ""Possession and Acquisition License"". I'm thinking that this is all I need right now because I don't intend to hunt or go off my own property with it. Looks like $145.00 to $150.00 for the course and exam if I read it right? I guess you could always challenge the exam for $40.00, but having never owned a gun, the course is probably a good idea. I just keep thinking of the ""Operators Card"" for boating and what a joke that really is. Hopefully this course is actually worthwhile? Any comments from those who have taken it recently?  Now, is a .22 the right thing to choose for small animals? What about long and short .22 bullets?"
449880,Syn,2010-03-30 14:41:00,519,Have you checked to see if air rifles for varmit shooting would fit your needs better? You'll still need pal for the higher FPS guns.
449896,Cookslav,2010-03-30 15:26:00,1457,"Go to your local gun shop, or shooting range and ask about the PAL course. Chances are there is a local place that can hook you up. I highly recommend taking the course if your not familiar with handling firearms. you'll learn a few things, but more importantly they pretty much drive saftey into your head which IMO is a Great thing, and also the reason incidents are so rare in Canada.  Its usually a weekend course or 2 weeks part time so its pretty unintrusive to your schedule. Bass pro would be great if your close....I'd prolly end up spending about 3x the amount in after class ventures though LOL! Cheers,"

449934,Billy Bob,2010-03-30 17:13:00,5865,"WOW, almost $500 just to purchase a firearm in Ontario...here you would go to any store that sells firearms...some Walmart's or just a gun shop and show them your drivers license and they do a INSTANT background check over the phone...takes about 30 minutes while you fill out the paper work...pay for the gun and go home....however, you do need a pistol permit if you want a piston...the above is only for shotguns and rifles.  So for a rifle or shotgun the only cost is the gun itself.  Bob"
449948,BUSTER,2010-03-30 17:35:00,1336, That's nice.....I think i'll be better off knowing people that own firearms in canada have to pass some sort of accredited testing.
449959,FUSION,2010-03-30 18:00:00,81, I wasen't aware they could check you mental stability over the phone...
449971,jedimaster,2010-03-30 18:22:00,3472,"If you aren't taking the hunting portion just go to the library, buy the book and challenge the exam. Its not that hard. The difficult part will be the hands on portion if you have never handled a gun before.  However I think unless you have a farm you will need to get a small game sticker and hence you will need to take the hunting course. As for  your choice of shells. I would take a look into the Varmint Grenade round from Barnes. It is by far the best ammo for varmints. If you are bored jut go onto you tube and do a search for varmint grenade.Its awesome. It will dispatch of varmints quickly and humainly. After seeing the video you will see why they call it varmint grenade. They come in 20 cal, 22 hornet, 22 cal, 223 and 6mm.  I would opt for a .223 it will offer you the best range of the three and 6mm is a bit of an awkward round to find a cheap gun for. If you are lookingt for a place to buy a cheap decent used gun try ellwood epps, they always have a good selection of used guns. There are all kinds of good guns that shoot .223 ammo. A .223 is also known as 5.56 mm. Its a Nato round use by the Canadian forces as well. If you are looking for a fun gun to shoot go for a semi like a ruger mini 14. They are so cool and fun to shoot and non restricted. If you are looking for acuracy, a nice bolt action remington 700, sako or a savage with an accutrigger will serve you well for many years and you will be able to hit a garter snake at 200 yards. Stay away from the single shots as you will quickly get bored of it. Removable magazine is also a great feature to have.   JMHO"
449985,Billy Bob,2010-03-30 19:16:00,5865,It's more about being CONTROLLED by your government....seems in Canada they control EVERYTHING you do up there...
449988,Billy Bob,2010-03-30 19:21:00,5865," Some GREAT advice.......only thing different I would recommend a .243 Win over the 6mm Rem round...basically the same round but the .243 Win is a MUCH easier ammo to purchase as far as availability even down here...if you want the BEST varmint/predictor caliber get yourself a .22-250 Rem...like this one....  I call this one ""Chuck Mate"" as it has never missed...with it's bull barrel and a 12X Leupold Scope I'm good to 400 yards.."

Unfortunatly the world has changed alot since then and I for one agree with Hunter education aswell as responsible education in owning and possesing firearms. I am not an advocate of the soon to be scraped gun registry but I do support the courses and education needed to aquire a gun today.
