449340,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-29 02:51:00,2050,"Hey gang!  I think this is my first thread on the new board.  I haven't had a lot of time to check out all the new features, but it looks awesome so far!  Good work on the change over guys!  I've been meaning to get Averie out for her first time picking worms and tonight was the perfect night.  Light drizzle, and warmish out.... Ginny let Averie stay up a little later to have a shot at catching some bait for next weekends panfish outing... We managed plenty of worms in about 20 minutes and boy was it funny watching her try to catch them! haha She had fun out there though and I can't wait to get out on the water next weekend. Get out there and get 'em!  Pretty funny video of Averie getting frustrated with the worms! lol          next weekends bait! free of charge, and memories made in only a few minutes of time!   Cheers, Ryan"

449360,jayess,2010-03-29 04:26:00,187,absolutely adorable... i imagine you can't wish for a better fishing buddy than that!  thanks for the laugh!
449367,steverowbotham,2010-03-29 09:33:00,1800,thats awesome
449378,Musky or Specks,2010-03-29 11:25:00,2710,Brought a huge smile to my face.You do realize however that if she fishes AND can catch bait you wont be able to keep the young men away from her when she gets older. Now all you need 2 do is teach her small engine repair
449380,lifeisfun,2010-03-29 11:30:00,99,"hehe, great pictures and catch !"
449381,Roy,2010-03-29 11:33:00,13728,"Adorable. It doesn't get much better than that, Ryan."
449382,solopaddler,2010-03-29 11:40:00,8605,Ryan that's priceless.  I cannot believe the worms are out already. That's incredible.
449383,splashhopper,2010-03-29 11:44:00,2931,"I love the look on her face with the dish full of worms.  Do you think she was gonna ask Ryan if she ""had"" to cook them for him too!"
449390,skeeter,2010-03-29 12:32:00,1907,i remember those days! with all 3 of my kids. now they wont do it. BUT and there is a BUT now i have a 5 year old grandson  thanks for the memory post
449402,dsn,2010-03-29 13:21:00,1018,  That's mighty grip she has there ! Anymore striength... and I can see the worm explode through both ends  The tail ends is already straighten out !!    DSN
449419,MJL,2010-03-29 14:32:00,2427,"Your daughter is super cool to the max Ryan...That vid was crazy awesome.  Also had a dewie picking session last night myself...Ended up with 90 or so snakes to add on to the other 40 I got from last weekend which didn't get gobbled up by steelhead yet.  The secret is to creep up to them like a ninja, jump on them like a tiger and then use the Jedi mind power trick to convince them to slide out of their hole   Hey Mike, we're right on schedule...Started the midnight worm snatching about 3 weeks ago...Usually this is the best time of the year for worm picking...Don't have to mow the grass before you start.  Lawns with grub problems are best - No grass at all"
449422,ehg,2010-03-29 14:38:00,2666,"Nice catches by you and your daughter  My daughter loves doing that as well but it was too late many times,so during the day, her idea was to scare and chase robins when we saw them pulling them from the ground and we would get a bucketful of worms. Going to nearby parks always got her a nice yield. Fun stuff!"
449602,ratmanrod,2010-03-29 22:21:00,2, Hello i would like to buy some worms i live in Indiana Usa would you know any one that would sell me dew worms?I would like around 500 to a 5000 thank Rod   [emailÂ protected]

449776,Sugarpacket,2010-03-30 03:53:00,82,awwww shes getting sooo big! just think in a few years you'll have to bait catchers for yourself never need to use the bait vending machine again!!!
450142,Syn,2010-03-31 00:10:00,519,"What a sweet child. I must be getting soft in my old age because when I see little kids enjoying their first few years of life and looking at everything around them in wonderment, it warms my heart.  Found this humorous today: http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-fish-almost-destroyed-my-childhood.html"
450322,Sugarpacket,2010-03-31 12:17:00,82, That was freaking HILARIOUS!!!
