Sure was nice to finally be able to spend the whole afternoon puttering around to get her all cleaned up and ready for another  fishing season after a long winter. Might even get all the electronics put back in tomorrow.  Now, if we can just get the rest of the ice off the lake I'll be all set  "
450038,skeeter,2010-03-30 21:14:00,1907,lew with that size of motor you should be able to jump across the ice back to open water.
450062,irishfield,2010-03-30 21:59:00,26272,Did you install the siren on that red truck yet???  ...to clear the launch area!  Mines ready to go too Lew... as I never even got a cover on it after the last musky trip. My rod is still leaning against the windshield with a perch bait on it..
450136,Rizzo,2010-03-31 00:02:00,4754,"that looks really sharp. i took the snow tires off the wife's van tonight after work, hope to do my car tomorrow after work then MAYBE get the boat from my sister's barn this week-end. Maybe if I tell my wife ""But Lew's boat is ready"" she'll let me go get it!"
