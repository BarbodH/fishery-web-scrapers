450068,Kawartha Kev,2010-03-30 22:07:00,281,I have a cottage on Lower Buckhorn and keep up to date with things by watching a webcam from a resort on the lake. I haven't been up to the cottage yet this year but it looks like the water levels are way down and there as no snow around to melt and raise the level anytime soon doesn't look good. Here is a link to the webcam if you are interested. Anyone else around the area that can add to the info on lake levels in the Kawartha's?

450105,Beans,2010-03-30 23:01:00,3339,I was down by the north shore of Pigeon Lake this afternoon checking the ice...  I would guess the water is up about a foot from last Saturday...    Today...  
450107,Sinker,2010-03-30 23:03:00,8692,Definitly the lowest I've ever seen it at this time of year. By far. Last year we were millimeters from a new high water record right now.......amazing how things change in one season huh?  S.
450118,Beans,2010-03-30 23:20:00,3339,"Ya Shane...last year the water was up to the top of our dock at the launch...today it is two feet below that...The waterway guys really lowered it a lot last fall...  Looks like I won't have to call on the Kawartha Dock Repair Comittee (Buckster, Meely and Crappieperchhunter) this year to fix any damage from the ice leaving our lagoon...she's all clear to the end...  I could launch the ""Tin of Beans"" in the lagoon but the entrance to the lake is still ice bound..."
