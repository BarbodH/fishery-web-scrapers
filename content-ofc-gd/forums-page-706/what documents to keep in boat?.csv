450223,Joey,2010-03-31 01:58:00,9122,"Also,  - Proof of Insurance - Boat Registration - Directions to closest beer store"
450226,irishfield,2010-03-31 02:01:00,26272,No requirement to have insurance on a boat hun... but I wouldn't go without it!  VHF radio operators licence if you have one installed. If they dont see you talking on it though.. not much they can do... until you're calling for help anyhow!
450241,POLLIWOGG,2010-03-31 02:34:00,835,ID with a picture...You have a half dozen licenses and your operators card  that are useless if you can't show ID.
450242,irishfield,2010-03-31 02:37:00,26272,"Good point Polliwogg. I generally leave my wallet on shore and only have my operators card and fishing licence with me... up until this fall when I heard they were asking for your drivers licence so I started carrying it. Not sure they can make that stick though.. as there is no requirement to have same in your possession when operating a boat, or fishing. I've personally never had the OPP or CO ask me for a drivers licence or photo ID.. and we've been pulled over beyond a dozen times in the last 2 years...and the last time was in Decemember."
450248,POLLIWOGG,2010-03-31 02:50:00,835,"Its in the books somewhere that you need ID, its in the fishn regs to prove over 65 and its part of the courtesy check. The trick is to give them anything but a drivers license, They want the drivers license to run you through the system."
450251,irishfield,2010-03-31 02:53:00,26272,On Outdoors Card is government issued ID! lol
450274,Guest nuker,2010-03-31 04:42:00,0,"is the boat registration the same as the pleasure craft license issued by transport canada?  it has my name, boat description, etc...  i figured that if i were to be checked by law enforcement, they'd prefer i have directions to the closest tim hortons?  "
450294,Rich Clemens,2010-03-31 10:13:00,3131,"I used to do the same as Wayne, with the wallet back in camp.   Recent years though, I've started keeping it with me.  I also keep a copy of our boat insurance and registration in the boat.   Being from the states, while in Canada, I also keep a photocopy of our passport photos."
450340,OhioFisherman,2010-03-31 13:01:00,6623,"My boat had a fixed pedestal on the drivers seat, the seat lifted off of it. I keep all my documents and out of state, country, fishing licenses in a baggie in the post."
450378,Uncle Buck,2010-03-31 14:37:00,1000,They ask for your drivers licence when you're getting a ticket for no lifejackets on board...  don't ask me how i know that...
450404,POLLIWOGG,2010-03-31 15:57:00,835,Nuker  The boat registration is for big boats that carry a name instead of license #. Generally much larger than most of us here would have. When the guys here talk about their boat registration what they are likely referring to is their license that the boat shows the #'s on the side for.
