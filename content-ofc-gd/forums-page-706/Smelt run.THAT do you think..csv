449853,mrpike,2010-03-30 13:53:00,151,THIS should be the week for the SMELT  run to start. I would think last night was a full moon and day time temps are getting up there .ICE is almost out in SIMCOE. I would think by THURSDAY NIGHT  it should be a go..  
449860,BITEME,2010-03-30 14:01:00,1968,I think I may dig out the poles and the seal beam and try Bronte It has been a very long time the net is probably rotted
450093,walleyejigger,2010-03-30 22:49:00,876,"i cant believ there hasn't been reports of runs already, the weather up here seems right if not past already"
450099,pike slayer,2010-03-30 22:56:00,1177,"ya seems to be about right and only a good month early!! last year i went april 21st and the last i went was the second week in may. conditions are right, waiting for some go getters to come back with reports before i venture out. i dont really care for smelts because of the whole cleaning part but catching is sooo much fun! anyone ever catch and release smelt???  hahahaha!!"
450106,Dara,2010-03-30 23:02:00,3052,"Still a bit early. Ice needs to be out of haviland and a good warm rain brings them in...mostly, we need the rain"
450109,Kinger,2010-03-30 23:04:00,351," This! Next rain I will be heading up north.  Gotta fix my auxilary net as well, the girlfriend is gonna put in a few hours this season instead of sitting around the fire."
