449220,laszlo,2010-03-28 22:29:00,487,Can't say they were the freshest of fish but they did come out to fight hard. I was sure this fish was going to push 9-10lbs. Pound for Pound the hardest fighter I've ever caught!     Partner in Crime...     And let's not forget the Sucka MC.      Finally the Pink Worm had my back!!!
