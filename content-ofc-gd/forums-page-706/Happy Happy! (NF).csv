449610,cheaptackle,2010-03-29 22:44:00,849,"Not one to normally get all uppity about moving, BUT!  Check out my new (formerly Uptergrove) location in my avatar. I've never fished this lake in my life in spite of it's proximity.  Today, while picking up the keys, I spent 45 minutes tossing out a slip float/micro tube jig set up just to get a line wet.  I was fishing from the ""front yard"", which is a small cove on the north shore, fairly deep & well protected.  You might say I christened it (the lake) today but it was more to get my float balanced to chase crappie (every time I take a car load up  ) later in the week. It's only an apartment in a house, but it's big enough for me and has the LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Along with being new ""turf"" to explore & enjoy year round, YAAAAY! Now I have to find me a boat (on a dime store budget) and start really ""testing"" all the goodies that seem to find their way into my satchels (yes, plural!) instead of on to the shelves (one of the few perks of being self employed - can't get busted for raiding the inventory!). I move in the middle of April and will probably still be unpacking in December 'cause the water is only about 50 feet thataways from the front door!  Yippee!  Michael"
449614,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-29 22:53:00,2582,"Congrats man!!!   Fishing in the back yard...you lucky son of a gun. I haven't fished St John in years and have only ice fished it, but I always wanted to have a boo at it in the summer sometime. I always thought it was a nice looking little lake. Post some pics when you have a lawn chair set up at the edge of the lake and your sippin a beer and setting the hook"
449618,Beans,2010-03-29 23:01:00,3339,"Congrats on finding new digs so close to fishing...  I always thought ""Uptergrove"" sounded obscene whenever I was driving through it..."
449625,irishfield,2010-03-29 23:12:00,26272, Just hope you're on high ground... the previous 2 years the water was above the front doors..  
449626,cheaptackle,2010-03-29 23:12:00,849," Ha ha! - that sounds even worse!  Thanks beans & hunter, I'm finding it difficult to not just pack & get there now (could if I wanted to) just because my new view of the lake will be much better than the inground pool I'm looking at now!  Michael"
449629,cheaptackle,2010-03-29 23:18:00,849," Wayne, I actually had heard and asked about that - when the lake was at its highest there was still a couple feet of freeboard to the house, but the break water did have waves topping it.  Grade slopes down from the house to the breakwater, about 2-1/2 foot drop from the top of the breakwater to the beach.  Water's real low right now, usually about 6"" up the breakwater I'm told, now there's almost 6 feet of ""beach""."
449636,irishfield,2010-03-29 23:37:00,26272,..and airport road in... if you're on bluebird..    I was in a few days before and was pushing water with my front bumper
449640,cheaptackle,2010-03-29 23:47:00,849,"Not sure about that one, Wayne, but I'm on (will be on) the North shore.  I never asked about the road in, or sighted along it either, it does dip down & up a bit from Rama Rd. but once you get in the trees it's not easy to sight line it.  I had asked if there was any problems with the high water and was told none, but we didn't discuss the road specifically.  I'll ask about it next time, thanks for the tip.  Michael"
449655,irishfield,2010-03-30 00:04:00,26272,That's the road into the airport...ends up on the East side of the lake.
449660,cheaptackle,2010-03-30 00:08:00,849,"Drove to the airport years ago.  I'll be diagonally northwest from there, right up by the trailer park.  Sent you a pm about it with a request.  Michael"
449696,Gerritt,2010-03-30 01:02:00,6129,"I pretty much grew up on that lake, spending every summer there with my grandparents.. and Wayne is right... watch for flooding. there is many years we have gone to the cottage only to find things floating... and Airport Rd, is prone to flooding.. and there is nothing that can be done about it as there are many areas that are protected all around the lake as a protected wetland, there by stopping any and all development.  anyways good luck with the move, and I hope it is not a basement Apartment!  G"
449829,cheaptackle,2010-03-30 13:03:00,849,"Thanks everyone!  It's a lower level on a raised cottage on the NORTH shore (nearest Washago, airport is on south shore nearest Casino).  As I said, I'll have to ask about the road in because we didn't discuss it, but the house was well above the high water line when St. John overflowed.  I get the idea, though, it's not as low lying as the rest of the lake might be. One of the best features about its location is proximity to other fishing opportunities (shorefishing) until I can scrape together enough for a small boat.  I've got enough years left in me (I hope) to finally really explore, hence my signature line indicating how I plan to be on the move.  I'll be keeping a note book and might even start a blog about it. Back to packing - it isn't easy to be inside my current location getting ready to move when I could be elsewheres fishing!
