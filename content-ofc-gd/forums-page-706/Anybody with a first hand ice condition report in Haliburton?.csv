450506,singingdog,2010-03-31 21:59:00,1047,"It really depends on the lake and the boatlaunch. Kashagawigamog is mostly open, Head will probably be open by the weekend. I have been kayaking on Mountain for 2 weeks, but it's easy for me to get on the water. The boat launch on Horseshoe is free of ice, as is much of the lake. Kennesis is mostly still tight to the shore, with a few open spots where there is current. Feel free to drop me a line with specific lakes, and I can go look for you."
