I've been going there a couple times a year now for 4 or 5 years and was just curious to see if anyone out there can give me any(more)advice on what they find works for the Pike and Walleye up there... we Usually fish around Elliot Island, Harris' and Hunter's Bays and had fairly good results but this year I want to be the leader in the boat so.. any help would be Appreciated.. Also any tips on the Musky would be nice too (would be handy later in the year)"
