I have gotten lots of good info and advice from reading all your posts, this is a great community.  I live out in Pickering but have fished all over last fall and hadn't landed anything in about 12 trips.  I had one on at the whirlpool but it snapped my line 20sec after hooking him.  I went out to a local creek on monday and finally landed my first bow! I had another one on shortly after that but he got off.  i did take a picture but it turned out quite poor on my 6yr old phone (mainly because i haven't used it in such bright sunlight and didn't adjust any settings).   I am going out again thursday morning and can hopefully get another with a decent camera on hand  I just want to thank everyone for keeping up such a friendly atmosphere here and hopefully i will be sharing lots in the next few months."
