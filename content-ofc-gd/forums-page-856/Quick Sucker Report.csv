I was down at the creek for a hour and a half today and caught 2 small suckers  Nothing to amazing but hey it felt nice to have a fish on the line. Was using a small hook tipped with a worm and 2 split shot leaving it on bottom.  Pictures: 1st Fish of 2009   And the second little guy,   It could not of been a better day but I'll be sure to bring a bottle of water next time, was pretty hot walking up and down the river."

335652,GoneFishin,2009-04-28 00:51:00,349,"Good job, suckers can be quite fun to fish for. You should bring a bag with you next time and try to keep some smaller ones and freeze them for pike fishing witch I'm sure you'll be doing in the future lol."
335664,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-28 01:18:00,3761," I saw some smaller 5-10"" sucker's, maybe I'll downsize some and try to get some. How should i freeze them, just in water say in a ziplock bag?"
335692,BillM,2009-04-28 02:02:00,17367,Slice them up as bait and sell them down in Dunville for the guys catching kitties
335709,GBW,2009-04-28 02:41:00,8460,"freeze them in a bag with no water, you will be good to go.  Oh and one per bag to make life easy... Good on ya for your first fish of 09, cheers!"

336112,profisher25,2009-04-28 23:17:00,185,The second pic of the fish looks like it has a lamprey wound or something on it.
