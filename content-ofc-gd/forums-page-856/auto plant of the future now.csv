336516,jediangler,2009-04-30 02:13:00,1923,This is a video of the Ford plant in Brazil. I found it quite interesting except for the cheapshot at the UAW at the end. It is from the Detroit news.  http://apps.detnews.com/apps/multimedia/pl...dex.php?id=1189
336518,joefish,2009-04-30 02:18:00,165,Of course no mention of how low the wage is....
336521,Roy,2009-04-30 02:22:00,13728,I didn't hear a cheap shot in there.
336525,holdfast,2009-04-30 02:41:00,1813,"I guess the Cheap shot is the Quote,  IF THE UAW WOULD ALLOW IT.  Meaning if the could have a plant using the same system in the USA.  Of course the UAW wont allow it.  Its mostly Robotic, who are they going to have to fill their pockets? with Union Dues."
336566,kenzy31,2009-04-30 04:49:00,261,no cheap shot at all! truth and nothing but
336572,mbac31,2009-04-30 04:59:00,904,Truth hurts.
336614,Gerritt,2009-04-30 12:51:00,6129,Interesting! thanks for the video  G

If the wages were not so high,then Ford and the rest the auto Industry,would not need to go to robots.The robots,if anyone knows,Is mostly used to assemble the body/fenders,rocker panels  firewall and such.The rest is done by working bodies.  That vid showed a very good concept that here and south of the boarder should really take to heart. IMO"
336775,jediangler,2009-04-30 21:05:00,1923,"Hey joefish, the minimum wage in Brazil is $200 U.S. per month. They did have a three day strike at the plant because they were getting considerably less money than other workers in the region. Who says you need a union to strike."
