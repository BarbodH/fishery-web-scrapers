336039,lew,2009-04-28 20:50:00,12766,Get yourself some square vinyl eavestrough and cut it to the lengths you need and put them inside your bag.  It makes for a decent tackle box for big lures.

I also use an electrician type carry-all for all my necessities- camera, sunblock, bug spray, leaders, terminal tackle, knife etc."

My buddy uses pails and hangs lures around the rim.  I have read that in the 70/80's guys used to use Styrofoam coolers.

336414,wolfmachine,2009-04-29 20:15:00,89,what if i spraypaint the styrofoam?                                                                                just joking
