All of my fish are catch & release. Most of my free time is searching for trout. I do alot of flyfishing/casting here in Ontario & in the Adirondacks......I'll start of with this little 9"" brookie I caught this afternoon with a small sliver/yellow panther matrin with the two barbs sniped off & the remaining barb bent back, as are all of my lures & hooks. Just as Red Fisher would have wanted it.  Cheers to all. "

335759,xeon,2009-04-28 04:13:00,350," Welcome to the board kewl-blue.  Keep in mind when your planning on releasing fish, take care to not harm their slime coat. Putting them on the ground like that is terrible for it. The dry dirt or grass will absorb it all like a sponge. But at the end of the day, youre really doing the fish more of a favor releasing it than keeping it, so good for you."
