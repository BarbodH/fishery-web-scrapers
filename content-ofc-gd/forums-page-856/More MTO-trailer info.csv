One of the conditions of your insurance coverage is that you be authorized by law to drive the vehicle or vehicle/trailer combination that you are operating.  Drivers of private passenger vehicles pulling trailers with a gross vehicle weight of more than 4,600 kilograms are required to possess a Class A license or a restricted Class A with a condition “R.”  The Gross Vehicle Weight is the combination of the vehicle weight and load.  The restricted Class A with a condition “R” applies to drivers who pass a Class A road test using a smaller truck and trailer combination, such as a pick-up truck pulling a large recreational, horse or utility trailer, while prohibiting them from driving larger, more complex tractor-trailers.  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/dri...classalic.shtml"
336470,Nippissinger,2009-04-29 23:38:00,53,"Yes this will apply to towed vehicles where the total combined weght of trailer and load exceeds 4600kg.  This will affect horse haulers with dual wheel pickups. Fifth wheel recreational haulers. Tandem and tri-axle haulers like personal watercraft and landscapers.  Basically any heavy tandem or triaxle without air brakes will be affected.  Also remember, if trailer has the RGW on ownership over 4600kg, then you are required.  Single axles are the way to go...Or of course have or aquire appropriate license for vehicles used...  Will"

336697,Woodsman,2009-04-30 17:01:00,1286,This is not new. As for enforcement. IIRC this came in effect in 2004. This post doesn't completely explain the current law. Please check out the Ontario MTO website.  Rick
