Coming out of his garage the rain is pouring down: it is like a torrential downpour. There is snow and sleet mixed in with the rain. The wind is blowing at over 50mph.  Minutes later he returns to the garage. He comes back into the house. Turns the TV to the weather channel and he finds it is going to be very bad weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the garage, quietly undresses and slips back into bed.  There he cuddles up to his wife's back, now with a different anticipation and whispers, ""The weather out there is terrible"". To which she sleepily replies, ""Yeah, can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in it?""    any more?"
