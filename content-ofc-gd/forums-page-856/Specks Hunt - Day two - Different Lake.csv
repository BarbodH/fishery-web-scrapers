336587,canadian_copper,2009-04-30 10:40:00,925,AWESOME FISH BRO . CONGRATS
334748,Leecher,2009-04-25 22:56:00,7832,"Well guys, today tackle another lake in hopes of catching more specks.... the plan was for Paul and I to go to our favorite lake for them.... Left home at 6:30am, temperature was 10C with a slight south west wind, made a pit stop to timmies for some hot refreshments and the way we go.  Got to destination at around 8:30am and this time around did not have a boat, had to walk around the lake to tackle our hot spots.   Man I must be getting old cause my legs a just hurting right now LOL  Keep reading you'll understand.  It's totally different scenario fishing this lake from shore with a lot of dead fallen trees on shore, hauling our gear through bush very tiring and makes casting our lures something to think about.  So I decided to leave my stuff to the first spot I stop to and continue on.... Not 20 minutes went by and make a good cast out, started my retrieve and guess what.... yes the inevitable happens... I get snag on an underwater  tree  Had to break the line and loose a $6.00 dollar Mepps  Now at this point I'm kind of peeved of loosing my lure, that my tackle box is about 100 meters away and have to walk over to get another..... lets just say that once I got back to my first spot and tied on another Mepps, I wasn't going back.... so I stayed where I was and chose another....  Got busy casting the second Mepps and all of sudden I get another snag.... well at least I thought it was until I see my line move to my right     I'm like ""OK SET THE HOOK!!!""  LOL  the battle lasted a couple of minutes until I saw this brute surfaced   and had to basically handle the rod so that it wouldn't run directly into a sunken tree.   Once I was able to beach it's head on shore, I reached with my right hand under it's belly and literally threw it on solid ground  LOL  Was I ever happy to see this monster out of the water.... Here it is folks, 18"" long by 12"" girth.... had no scale on hand and don't know what the weight is!!! All I can say is that is the biggest speckle I ever caught on soft water    Here's another shot of her    This would be the only one we caught all day.... got back home at around 4:00pm. I just can't believe the size of the fish.... All in all was great to be out and thankful that I had to return to my original spot to retie.  Hope you enjoy Leechman  P.S.  Glen aka GCD, I know in my previous report I said that I would make a video of how I clean specks but this one is too big for that.... she's going to give me a couple of big filets"
