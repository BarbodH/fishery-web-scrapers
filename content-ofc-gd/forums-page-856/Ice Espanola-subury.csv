334114,BassAsin,2009-04-23 23:10:00,806,was out for a while today for specks open about 10-20 feet from shore on North  (south facing side)  still almost enough snow in the bush to snowmobile in a lot of spots this is a shot from about 20 feet up you can see the ice is pretty crap. might still be ice on them in a week  this was north of espanola about 15 miles.  Matt!

334163,Dara,2009-04-24 00:49:00,3052,  You won't get me on any ice now. I think it was 3 or 4 years ago we lost a friend up here on the ice about a week ago. If I stand at shore and say....I think it should be ok...then its not. For a couple fish...I don't think so.   You planning on Big Basswood pikeslayer?
334204,irishfield,2009-04-24 02:16:00,26272,Didnt' say it was smart... just that the ice is still there and will be for a couple weeks yet. I'm gonna lose my ice out bet of the 28th I know that. Be lucky if I can drive the boat up the lake on the 11th.
334278,youngvedder,2009-04-24 12:07:00,72,"perhaps with all the warm weather/rain this weekend up there the ice will take a final beating and be gone for MAy 1st!  thanks for the info guys,  Yv"

335469,pike slayer,2009-04-27 17:02:00,1177,dara i wasnt really planning on big basswood but i did hear theres no longer ice on it. i was talking to a buddy that has a camp on garden lake up the ranger lake road and he said there is pretty much just a bunch of ice bergs floating around and by the end of this week the boat is going in the water. im currently waiting on motor parts and as soon as those are in i'll be heading out. although i was thinking of hiking into clearwater lake behind northland lake for some ice out lakers but i bet there is still ice on it and would suck hiking in all that way. also there is still snow in the bush and more then likely snow on the roads and a high possibility of getting the truck stuck in the slushy melting snow.

336391,Dara,2009-04-29 19:03:00,3052,"  I heard Basswood opened up on Sunday. If I can bum a ride in a boat I will be going for whitefish saturday or sunday. I just ordered my boat today and will hopefully have it for next week. I don't feel like putting the old one in the water as I already sold it. Pretty much to the first guy that I said...hey, I have a boat for sale if you know anybody interested.  Never heard of clearwater  PS...know anybody that wants a good ATV?"
336397,Craig,2009-04-29 19:14:00,33,Sent you a PM about the ATV. Thanks
336426,pike slayer,2009-04-29 20:40:00,1177,ya you never heard anything about clearwater   what kinda atv is it? i'd love to get one but cant afford one right now unless someone gives me a good chunk of change for my sled. 03 rmk 700
