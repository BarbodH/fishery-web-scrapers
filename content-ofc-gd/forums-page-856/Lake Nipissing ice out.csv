336619,Bob,2009-04-30 13:00:00,370,"Now this is the kind of thing all those global warming alarmists should look at.  Doesn't seem like there's any pattern or trend there at all.  I realise that this is all a local thing but......  if warming was truly global, you'd think that some kind of pattern would appear wouldn't you?  From the 1890s to the 1920s, cooling was the hype. Then from the 30s to the 50s, it was warming.  In the 60s and the 70s, we had an ice age coming and then from about 80 on, it was warming.  Looking at those numbers, I just don't see it. I lived through the hype in the 60s and 70s and didn't believe it then and I still don't."
336714,4thgen,2009-04-30 18:06:00,157," Glancing at a data set and deciding whether or not there is a trend? Not exactly scientific.  The more appropriate term is ""climate change"", which implies that the climate is changing, not necessarily warming everywhere.  The effects are far more pronounced in the arctic where warming has been well documented for quite awhile.  I'm not a subsciber to the whole Al Gore thing because alot of what he has to say is blown out of proportion, but to deny that the climate is changing is just plain stupid."

336815,johnnyb,2009-04-30 23:21:00,3413,"In 1996, I remember taking supplies to Camp Mac Mac (one of the lodges near the mouth of the French) on May 12th, the day after the ice went out....nasty 18 mile ride with big waves...one of the boats got its floorboards cracked from the gear bouncing up and down in it...good times"
336849,hotrod,2009-05-01 00:45:00,103," I don't think it's stupid to question global warming at all, and changing the term to climate change is an attempt to mislead people. Bob's got it right, this is the new hysteria.  http://www.dailynewscaster.com/2009/01/06/...ear-population/  http://www.wnho.net/global_warming.htm"
