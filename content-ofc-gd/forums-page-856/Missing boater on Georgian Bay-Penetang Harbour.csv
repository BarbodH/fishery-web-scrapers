After five days of searching, no sign of the 29-year-old boater has turned up, including his 14-foot fibreglass vessel.  Police had been searching a massive area this week -- some 150 square kilometres -- from Penetanguishene Harbour to north of Honey Harbour, but the focus has been diverted back to the local harbour.  The OPP's underwater search and recovery unit arrived in Penetanguishene Harbour yesterday morning, near Dusome's last-known location. They are using side-scan sonar in their search for clues. The unit is expected to be back in the harbour today.  ""We're still searching, we're still active,"" said Southern Georgian Bay OPP Const. Peter Leon. ""But every day that passes, it's more difficult for the family and for the officers involved.  ""But we want to bring him home safely, so we're bringing in every possible resource,"" the constable added.  Assistance from the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Trenton was suspended around 3:30 p. m., Wednesday, and the OPP has taken over the investigation.  Police say Dusome moored his boat last Thursday evening at the Town Dock and went ashore to Yorkie's Bar and Grill. He was last seen leaving the bar around 12:30 a. m., last Friday, and presumed to be making the return trip in his boat to Harbour West Marina on the other side of Penetanguishene Harbour.  His family reported him missing Monday night after he failed to return home or show up for work.  Recent weather conditions have made the search difficult, but provincial police had a helicopter in the air over Penetanguishene Harbour yesterday.  ""Unfortunately, the water conditions and wave action were very turbulent, making it very difficult for our spotter being up that high,"" Leon said.  Authorities are not sure what kind of safety equipment Dusome had aboard his small boat, which he uses daily as his primary mode of transportation to travel from his home to work at nearby Bravo Marine Services.  Area residents are asked to call the provincial police communications centre at 1-888-310-1122 if any possible evidence of Dusome's whereabouts washes ashore.  His boat is described as creamy white with a 25-horsepower Johnson outboard motor.  Dusome is described as white, about six feet tall with a muscular build, short brown hair and a reddish goatee. He weighs about 210 pounds. He was last seen wearing light brown overalls, a dark green jacket and dark coloured boots.  Article ID# 1537512"
334493,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-24 22:15:00,0,Its strange they dont say that they found his boots washed up in two separate areas. He was a very nice guy. Give you the shirt off his back. It's a sad deal. Hope they find him soon.
334504,irishfield,2009-04-24 22:33:00,26272,"The whole thing's weird Andy... rumour all around town that they found him in one place and his boat in another today and no ""official"" news of that.. so I'll leave it as a rumour."
334701,Rich Clemens,2009-04-25 20:36:00,3131,Well then ... there's still hope.
336440,ciceri,2009-04-29 21:21:00,535,Anyone hear anything new?

333113,BillM,2009-04-21 18:11:00,17367,:EDIT:  Let's hope they find him.
333117,Cast-Away,2009-04-21 18:25:00,790,"Unfortunately he was wearing dark coloured clothing, so if he did fall out of the boat, he will be difficult to spot. When the water is this cold, a floatation suit makes alot of sense, but was not mentioned in the article, so who knows if he was wearing one?"
333192,Cudz,2009-04-21 23:01:00,2652,Yeah I saw that Herc out this morning coming into Penetang.  I thought it must be a search but I hadn't heard anything about it.
333215,Sinker,2009-04-21 23:45:00,8692,"Its a bad time of year to swamp your boat, that's for sure.  I hope they find the guy.  Sinker"

333237,irishfield,2009-04-22 00:25:00,26272,"For god sakes lads... lets not take this thread ""south"" as well. His family is devistated... Anyone one of us could be in this position tomorrow...  Nothing as of 5pm when the boys went by for the last time to wave me good bye before heading back to Trenton. Some of my brothers old crew...  Leah said she saw a helicopter over Waub way and three ambulances booting down #12 at 6:30... not sure if it's related or not. I've heard some talk that it's possible he headed for Waub after getting in the boat in Penetang Harbour Thur Night/Friday am."

333278,Tom McCutcheon,2009-04-22 01:23:00,627,Was that wind as bad in your area yesterday as it was here Wayne? If so I am sure the waters were whipped up pretty good.  Hope he is OK.  Tom.
333280,irishfield,2009-04-22 01:28:00,26272,Yep... wind to 65K yesterday. Strong today as well. Hope he's holed up an an island somewhere.... but we're now talking almost 4 full days.

333641,Cudz,2009-04-22 20:55:00,2652,He is 29 years old and I believe his name is Nick Dusome.  Does't look promising now but you never know.  I hope this somehow has a happy ending.
