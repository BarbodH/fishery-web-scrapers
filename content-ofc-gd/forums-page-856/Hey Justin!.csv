Sentier is a great magazine to write for, even though I can't read a single word when the issues come out..  And the English version of that very article will be in TJ's next issue of the newsletter...  As for reports, only made it out on the ice once this season But will be uncovering the boat this weekend, and getting her good and wet - for the next 7 months!!  Here's wishing you all a good season...  Justin"
