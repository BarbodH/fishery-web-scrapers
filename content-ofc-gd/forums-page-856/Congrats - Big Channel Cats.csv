Great fishing, yet no update for the leader board there have been some nice fish caught...  Third place leader weighed in another one ( man in float suit in pictures) tonight weighing 20.60 so they are still around..."
336528,e-z-out,2009-04-30 02:44:00,1052,I'm getting the itch to go back again this weekend jen. Now will the weather be good for the weekend?
336589,wallyboss,2009-04-30 11:17:00,1095,how do they taste when they are big like that??
336591,Whitespinnerbait,2009-04-30 11:26:00,2038, Probably taste like Catfish .............
336593,Gerritt,2009-04-30 11:36:00,6129,You do not want to eat them that size.
336669,CLofchik,2009-04-30 15:56:00,854, I'd take Grand kitties over any trout or salmon from Lake O. Under 10lb. they're darn tasty.
336673,Dara,2009-04-30 16:07:00,3052,"Well, you don't need many for a meal at that size. I wanna catch some a them"
336813,Leecher,2009-04-30 23:17:00,7832,That's some enormous kittys them guys caught!!!  congratulations to all of them Thanks Jen for sharing those beauty pics Leechman
336817,johnnyb,2009-04-30 23:24:00,3413,"I ate a 10 lb'er last weekend...wll be the last big one I eat...lots and lots of fat.  THe meat itself was delicious though!  Can't wait to eat the smaller ones that are swimming around the freezer Unrelated to the consumption of said catfish, my 9 year old son is looking a little pale...don't think he'll be fit for school tomorrow...we are heading down to Dunnville, 'cause we've got cat fever!!!!"
336823,smokin joe,2009-04-30 23:31:00,226,"I myself prefer the 3-6 lb range for consumption when the waters colder.  They're quit tasty.  Thanks for the update Bern, how have Steve and the boys been doing?"
