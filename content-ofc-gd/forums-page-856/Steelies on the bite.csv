336055,tibbs,2009-04-28 21:22:00,650,This opener all my steelhead have been on pink worms with an exception of one that hit roe.

336143,silverstreak,2009-04-29 00:44:00,146,The Riverworms that I use come in 2 and 3 inch lengths. You can rig them wacky style however I like to use them on Jig heads. On occassion I also use the old needle technique and thread the line down the worm. Hope this helps. Cheers
