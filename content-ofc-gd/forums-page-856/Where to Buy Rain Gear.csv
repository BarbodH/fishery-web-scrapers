336296,holdfast,2009-04-29 12:51:00,1813,XS Cargo you can get a decent Rain Jacket for $6.99.  I got a Colemans at one time.  I think what they have now are Wet Skins.  Just by your Bibs at Marks as Sonny eluded to you.  We out in Oil Country have a Factory Wearhouse where you can buy industrial cloths at a decent price including Fireproof coveralls.  Not sure if its a chain that is out your way.
336297,Raf,2009-04-29 13:05:00,3495,"go goretex or go home.  try mail order.  the $20 rainsuits are priced appropriately, they will tear on you and you'll sweat your balls off"
336329,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-29 15:14:00,947,Gore-tex or Frogg Toggs
336330,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-29 15:14:00,947,Columbia too
336460,bow slayer,2009-04-29 22:57:00,1074,try the Columbia Outlet in Windsor. They have a ton of rain wear about half price or even lower. It is all Columbia brand  they have light weight suits all the way to top of the line marine/boat wear.
336517,splashhopper,2009-04-30 02:14:00,2931,TSC stores at Wonderland / Wharncliffe/Exeter road junction  OR  the new TSC store at Veterans Memorial Parkway(Airport Rd) and Dundas st
336519,rob v,2009-04-30 02:19:00,535,I'm not sure what their selection is like or their price range but you may want to try Novak's right down town. I haven't been in their store for lately but I know they have all kinds of out door wear.  http://www.novacks.com/article/default.asp?aid=112
