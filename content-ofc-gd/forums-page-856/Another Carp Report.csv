No more than 15 minutes at the spot and I had the first one on. My son decided that he wanted to help bring it in so he grapped on and found out that carp a a little more powerful than him!      So we got it in and it was a decent 23 1/2"" with a few battle scars on her.    She decided to get back at me and kick 5 pounds of mud on me during the release. Thankfully my wife didn't have the camera.  In the next 30 minutes I got quite a few hits but couldn't get the hook set. Finally I got another one on and brought it in by myself this time. But Jacob did join me for the picture    Had a few more hits before it got dark but it was time to get the baby to sleep. It was another great evening with the family and a great way to forget about the day at work.  Dan"

336276,Victor,2009-04-29 11:48:00,1609,"Great job once again! That seems like a nice little creek to fish at. I'm sure it won't be long before your son land his first carp, and don't be suprised if that one is bigger than all of the ones you have been catching"
