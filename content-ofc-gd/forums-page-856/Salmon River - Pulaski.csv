335770,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-28 04:44:00,0,"So I've hit the end of a 6 day stint working around the salmon river. What a fantastic fishery.  I literally walked out of my hotel 10 minutes and was on fish. Some of the days the water was as high as 1600 cfs, but when they dropped flows down to around 700 cfs the fishing was fantastic.  Truthfully, with the exception of a few high water and cold days, the fishing was great.  Average size 'bow was about 5 lbs with my new PB being over ten.  I don't have a ton of pictures as I was fishing alone much of the time and didn't feel safe trying to tame 'bows, a 15'6"" rod, and my DSLR all at once...  Here's two pics though..One is of my coworker and him holding an average salmon river steelie and the second is of my first brown (over 8 inches anyways)...  All in all, in my brief morning fishes before work I landed about 20 steelies, had my ass handed to me on a plate by a bunch more...    "
