336753,misfish,2009-04-30 20:28:00,29133,"About 6 years ago, I got permission to hunt on some property that took me awhile to get.Showing honesty and helpping out with the land owner  sharing my reward of the kill,and also be a watch dog for tresspassers. Now I have another 100 acres of bush to hunt,that holds turkey and deer. How did I get it? Well, I gave the name and number of the land owner I now hunt on, and he checked it out. Came back to me and said I was more then welcome to hunt on his property.He has had some issues with trespassers as did the land owner whos property I hunt on now.I told him to just give me a letter signed,that I have permission to hunt there and I have the power to ask anyone to leave.I,ll be out there Friday afternoon to post signs around his whole property for him. Ioffered to pay for the signs,but he said he will have them for me.  Im so stoked.  Looking forward to hunting a new piece of property."

336787,kickingfrog,2009-04-30 22:10:00,8333,  There is a workout you would be hard pressed to simulate in the gym.
