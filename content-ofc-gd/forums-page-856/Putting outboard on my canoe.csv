336674,addy79,2009-04-30 16:08:00,573,"It depends on the quality of battery you purchase...  I bought the Marine battery, think its called ""Nautilis""?? from CTC.  If im alone on the canoe, it will last me around 6 hours (im usually only trolling at speeds 2 or 3), the more you stop and go, the quicker it will drain.  I have used mine to troll for lakers on back lakes as well, as long as you keep a nice steady troll and avoid the stop and go it should last AT LEAST 5 hours.  be sure to drain the batt all the way before re charging to increase its lifespan (Those batteries arent cheap!)"
336677,addy79,2009-04-30 16:09:00,573,  is this true????!  i thought it was only for motors over 10hp? your telling me i need one for the minn kota!? WOW  what about boat rentals?? do u need the card to rent one now to??
336678,CLofchik,2009-04-30 16:15:00,854," If it's over 13' ANY motor needs an operator card, if you ever fish around Toronto you'll also need a harbour license. $250 fine without a card and putting a Minn Kota on a 16' canoe.  Rentals you don't need a card.   http://boating.ncf.ca/#reg"
336685,Dara,2009-04-30 16:24:00,3052,"So I still have a hundred an thirty eight days to get it...np  Thats pretty cool a 12 year old and a 16 year old can run a 40 hp and a 12 year old and a 17 year old can run 300hp But I can't run a 12' boat with a 15 hp without a card.  I know, this has been way overdone, but I'm like that"
336695,Woodsman,2009-04-30 16:55:00,1286,Those 12 -17 years of age you refer to also need a card now. As for a 12' boat everyone needs a card now. The hp on these boats do not apply as far as requiring a PCOC.  Rick
336336,Craig,2009-04-29 15:34:00,33,Just wondering.  I have a 16ft older kevlar canoe.  Weighs about 40lbs or less. I wanted to hit a couple of back lakes but don't feel like paddling against the wind anymore. I was looking at the Suzuki 2.5hp at 30lbs or the merc 2.5hp at 38 lbs.  Are there any issues I need to be aware of putting a small outboard on this type of canoe?  I thought about electric but carrying that battery around turned me off.  I should clarify.  It's not a square back.  I'll need a side mount bracket.  Anything I should know.  Thanks everyone.
336339,Nemo,2009-04-29 15:43:00,727,How will you be mounting it? Also it may change the initail stability of the canoe i.e it will seem tippy to side the motor is mounted.  If mounting to the gunwale please note that the kevlar may crack form the motor's torque.  Also I would test out your set up before hand. Any issues would be better to discover before your trip. Don't ask me how I know
336340,Woodsman,2009-04-29 15:45:00,1286,Side brackets can seriously upset your weight balance. A wave or even worse a boat wake can flip you easily. About 6 years ago I had to rescue 2 people in the middle of Wildwood Reservoir. A boat wake flipped them and their canoe with a side mounted motor. Of course everything in the canoe including fishing gear and his wallet were lost to the bottom.  Be Safe: Rick
336341,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-29 15:48:00,10439,"If you want to put a motor on your canoe, sell the one you have and get a square stern Sports Pal. Your canoe wasn't designed for a motor and you should not put one on it. Buy the proper gear and be safe."
336342,Craig,2009-04-29 15:49:00,33,This is exactly why I'm asking!!!  I'm no small guy at 6'3 245 so tippyness is important to me... Thanks! Keep your thoughts coming. I
336353,pike slayer,2009-04-29 16:41:00,1177,"just balance it out and get a motor for each side! if money is a concern or you dont want to get rid of the canoe cause who knows it may be great grand papas then i say rig something up and test it out, go to kinsmen pond or something and give it a try. if not just find a flat back, also most back lakes have boats stashed at them. dont mind giving away this back lake your thinking of?  if you need a buddy to come along im more then willing to go, im layed off and i have nothing to do. and i already have a minn kota and just toss the battery in a back pack."
336354,Craig,2009-04-29 16:41:00,33,Anyone have good results with this set up? Getting nervous...
336355,Craig,2009-04-29 16:43:00,33, Just wondering if I should fork out the $1000 for a motor.   The other responses got me nervous. Work at Essar?
336360,pike slayer,2009-04-29 16:48:00,1177,"those 2.5hp mercs are very nice, i believe h&s has 09s for a 1000 plus taxes. but they do put out alot of power for a canoe, my buddy has one and it will go faster then an old 7.5hp evinrude. no i wasnt working at essar, i worked at fitzpatrick industries in industrial court. i say tinker around a bit, im sure you can rig up something that works, besides if your fishing a back lake theres normally zero waves or other ppl. put your gear in 5gallon buckets and wear a life jacket incase the worst happens."
336362,addy79,2009-04-29 16:52:00,573,"i hate paddlin as much as the next dude, but wouldnt do that!  i hooked up a 32lb thrust minnkota to my 90lb coleman canoe and it MOTORS on my backlakes, not neaRly as much of a weight issue to deal with.  the only canoes ive seen with outboards are the old colemans with the flat back  minnkota goin for less than $200 at CTC n basspro"
336366,troutologist,2009-04-29 17:13:00,951,If it was a heavy old fiberglass canoe you would be in business.  Wrong material. theres a couple square sterns on sootoday if you want to go that route.
336374,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-29 17:50:00,10439,If you end up putting a motor on your current canoe go with a mount like this one on the Edmonton Kijiji site.  Canoe Motor Mount
336376,Craig,2009-04-29 18:01:00,33,"Okay, if most people are saying no, does the same apply for the electric motor?"
336377,addy79,2009-04-29 18:08:00,573,"i mount my minn kota to the side of my canoe all the time, never had an issue with the weight dispersion.  just slow down if your makin a sharp turn and put a pail of sand in the front when flying solo.  works like a charm!"
336380,Craig,2009-04-29 18:23:00,33,Do you attach it right to the side or on a motor mount? I guess the battery could go up front to help offset the weight (me).
336395,Victor,2009-04-29 19:11:00,1609,i have never owned one but it doesn't seem that it'd be good to put a motor mount + motor on a kevlar canoe ... correct me if i'm wrong guys ... (i think someone mentioned it earlier as well)
336400,Craig,2009-04-29 19:22:00,33,"Its seems to be okay to put an outboard on a 38lb sportspal, I just figured it would be okay for the kevlar. I guess it's in the construction?"
336428,addy79,2009-04-29 20:46:00,573,"I mount it right to the side of the canoe, just behind my seat. hopefully the motor has a telescopic handle and you can stretch it out in front of you. The closer the motor is to the back of the canoe, the easier it will be to manouver.  You wont need any special mounts, i just put pieces of wood on either side of the bracket to ensure it clamps on flush.  if the batt cable can stretch to the front of the canoe, problem solved, otherwise i would suggest a bucket half full of sand to keep the nose down.  my minn kota is, i think, 35ft/lbs of thrust and she boogies a hell of a lot faster than i can paddle her! if your is kevlar it prolly motors even more!  good luck!"
336435,ciceri,2009-04-29 21:03:00,535,"been using a 2hp johnson on our 16 foot, side mounted, usually 2-3 people in the canoe, never a problem."
336447,Radnine,2009-04-29 21:48:00,1538,I don't have a thought on this one way or another (because I don't have a clue) but I wanted to say the quality of responses on this thread have been top notch. This is what makes this community great. Jim
336498,gdelongchamp,2009-04-30 01:00:00,199,Grumman use to make a very nice 14' square stern canoe that was extra wide. Great for carrying a moose quarter. I would suggest checking a couple sites for one of these.  A camp operator use to keep a couple on Upper Medicine Stone lake (NW Ont) and we would borrow it for a day when we hunted the lake. They were great. I onwned a couple aluminum canoes back then but the Grumman was the best handling in frigid waters. You don't want to upset at this time of year.
336524,CLofchik,2009-04-30 02:38:00,854,"Just remember as soon as you put a motor, gas or electric, on any water craft you need your Operators Card.  Canoe, surf board, even a pontoon or float tube."
336532,Dara,2009-04-30 03:01:00,3052,  You're still ok till sept with a 14'  I'm working on getting an old 2 hp running. If you think about it long enough you can use it to give it a try before you dump a grand buying one to test it. I need a gas tank for a 2 hp evinrude about a 1975 model
336604,Woodsman,2009-04-30 12:21:00,1286,Depends on your age.
336611,Craig,2009-04-30 12:42:00,33," Just curious, was it Kevlar?  I agree, these are amazing responses.  Thank you everyone.  In summary, I understand putting a outboard on a canoe is okay as long as it's built for it.  My old kevlar likely is not.  However a light electric motor would be a good option and somehow put the battery near the front to offset my weight in the back.  With a 30 or 36 lb thrust motor can I troll around all day? (battery life)  Lake trout is right around the corner up here!  Thanks again everyone!"
