335654,GoneFishin,2009-04-28 00:55:00,349,I wish it would open sooner! I seen a nice 40+ incher cruising around today and it got me right stoked for pike opener again. I wish they would open it a little sooner in zone 20...
335657,pikeie,2009-04-28 01:02:00,380," well i wouldnt say the ""rest of ontario"" opens on may 9th. i know that the Soo is open all year for pike.  and i belive anywhere past Sudbury is too...."

336094,RsX,2009-04-28 22:42:00,48,that's why u guys coem down to the big LAKE O
336114,Cudz,2009-04-28 23:21:00,2652,I want to fish near here and be able to fish for both pike and walleye.  ight hit up Couch.
336442,ciceri,2009-04-29 21:24:00,535,"I want to hit up Georgian Bay this weekend, but it's been rough out there these days, and we launch the boat with marine railway, so it's tricky as we are out in the more open part."
336846,pidge,2009-05-01 00:32:00,438,"my bad guys l.ontario looked to me like zone 16, thanks for the heads up maybe I bump into some of ya down there May 2. tight lines."
336852,MillerPhoto,2009-05-01 00:49:00,147,Thinking of giving Brighton Bay a try this weekend! Theres a few locations that are fishable from shore in which you can reach the edge of weedbeds. Also know of a little shallow cove that ive heard of people catching pike in.
332430,MSBruno,2009-04-20 13:00:00,369,"Where's everyone planning on celebrating this momentus occaision?  I haven't fished for 5 years and trying to get back into it, but I'm looking for some spots in the Toronto area where I the likelyhood of getting skunked is lower than ususal.  I'm on call for work, so I'll have to stick to the Toronto area.  Leslie Split? Ontario Place? Spadina Marina?  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.  If you wish to not publically share ur honey hole, please feel free to PM or email me at markbruno at sympatico dot ca if you care to share with me your spots  Thanks in advance!"
332448,juan96,2009-04-20 13:32:00,23,I have no idea around Toronto area but Belwood lake is one of the famous place for pike fishing. Also I will head up to Mountberg from 2nd Sat. of May.  Mountberg is my favorite place because there is very close from my home. Lots of pike in there too.
332450,MSBruno,2009-04-20 13:35:00,369, Do they still have their annual pike derby?  Any link?
332476,jediangler,2009-04-20 14:00:00,1923,Here's a link to the Belwood pike derby.  http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cf...b1=5&sub2=0  May 23 & 24th.
332599,cranks bait,2009-04-20 18:48:00,721,"If I am lucky, I'll be going out my front door and about five minutes up river in my boat.  Although opening day weather usually is windy cold and rainy so I wimp out?"
332604,tdotfisherman,2009-04-20 18:57:00,317,"Unfortunately for me I'm going to be working the weekend of Pike opener.. I'll probably get out on the Monday after opener.. the action should be good still, and a lot less people, just the way I like it.."
332609,salmon,2009-04-20 19:06:00,334,"Island lake, Orangeville.  If not then May 24 long weekend, always pike in there. Riot to catch  Jose"
332620,mepps,2009-04-20 19:17:00,1301,I'll be out at Toronto Islands on May 2nd hopefully!
332641,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-20 20:14:00,3761,"I'm not going out right on the opener but soon after it. I'm going to Parry Sound to fish the Georgian Bay, can't wait"
332652,irishfield,2009-04-20 20:28:00,26272,The end of my dock..
332655,trophypikehunter,2009-04-20 20:29:00,89,"You can find me on Cook's Bay(but I hope you dont) searching for that 40+ incher,"
332792,bassmaster4,2009-04-21 00:24:00,801,Belwood used to be good for getting lots of 20-25 inch pike but now it is really over fished and most people keep all of their fish that fishery has taken a huge hit
332839,SBCregal,2009-04-21 01:25:00,688,i'll probably be around somewhere in the hamilton bay area... down by the bridge maybe  has anyone fished bayfront park for pike?  ryan
332872,jediangler,2009-04-21 02:34:00,1923,"bassmaster4 is right, but, where else can you win big bucks with a 24"" pike."
332884,Mike the Pike,2009-04-21 02:59:00,3421,Who cares about Pike thats when I would rather be hunting walleye.  Of course I always seem to catch Pike while fishing for other species.Thats how i got my name.
332887,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-21 03:10:00,270,"going to hit Rice Lake this Saturday with another new member seems like a nice fellow. I will have to be heavily medicated that day to seem ""normal"" lol"
332906,Ramble,2009-04-21 03:50:00,713,I'll be after turkey's. I MIGHT manage a pike outing or 2 In Prince Edward County....then I'm off to the north!  -Dave
332930,Nippissinger,2009-04-21 10:00:00,53," Define ""normal"". Medicated with a controlled substance is accepted by many...LOL"
335280,pidge,2009-04-27 02:55:00,438,its May 9th correct? not the 2nd for Toronto (zone 16) area pike.
335290,RsX,2009-04-27 03:07:00,48,it's first saturday in may what is may 2 right??
335297,pidge,2009-04-27 03:17:00,438,"umm not sure Nigel. Thats why I wana make sure. The mnr site says for pike in zone 16 (which is where Toronto falls) Jan 1st-March 31st, and second Saturday in May-Dec 31st. Second Saturday I belive is the 9th."
335353,MSBruno,2009-04-27 11:31:00,369,May 2 for Lake Ontario - Zone 20  May 9 for Rest of Ontario - Zone 16
335360,Governator,2009-04-27 11:52:00,879,  Yea this is correct.  Zone 16 opens 2nd saturday in May.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001335.pdf
335362,Governator,2009-04-27 11:54:00,879,  This is right but wrong zones.   May 2nd - Zone 20 opens (L. Ontario)   May 9th - Zone 16 opens (basically southern ontario)
335364,MSBruno,2009-04-27 11:56:00,369, my mistake  I've corrected my post
