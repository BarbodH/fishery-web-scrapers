336785,bassman,2009-04-30 21:38:00,384,"Hey gang,  I'm staying on the east side of Six Mile Lake in a few weeks, and I wanted to see if there are any boat launches on the east side of the lake (Hungry Bay Road). If not, where are the launches?  I did notice a bait shop in Bala. Are there any bait shops closer to the lake?  It's my first time there and any help would be appreciated.  Thanks"

Hungry Bay is near middle to both. Wauwatosa is on Crooked Bay Rd. 6 Mile is on same offramp as provincial park"
336899,irishfield,2009-05-01 02:46:00,26272,I peeked around on Google Earth and see a landing and numerous docks on Hungry (presume a launch there?).. on the West side of it's Northern Bay. Access would be the road off the 400 after 6mile PPark (when heading North).. in on it and then south down the road on the Pennisula in the middle of the lake.
