I'll give Clamp-it credit he satyed out in the cold all day(I had lo look after my little girl in the nice warm flip up) No picks but a fun day."

296776,Sinker,2009-01-24 22:02:00,8692,"Atta boy! Good on ya for getting out........some members whimped out today!!!!  Clamp-it, gotta hand it to ya man, it was a brisk day!! Did you set up the tarp?? It wouldn't have been as bad out of the wind, but still friggen cold out there!!!  Sinker"
296781,Greencoachdog,2009-01-24 22:07:00,8163,Jeds a tough ol' bird when his back aint actin' up!  He was able to spend the day out in the cold because he had Granny's antifreeze pumpin' thru his veins!!!  Maybe y'all didn't catch as many as you wanted to today... but I'm sure you skeered the   out of the ones you didn't catch!  Y'all will get them next time!!!
296785,Terry,2009-01-24 22:11:00,14456,and here I wimped out today and stayed home  fish and fresh air is always better then sitting at home or work
296792,Clampet,2009-01-24 22:22:00,1947,"That Ray is a class act, and his daughter is very well behaved and didn't mention going home even once.  I suppose it helped she was oufishing the both of us 2 to 1. Perty good fer a 10 year old!  Here is a couple pics..     "
296860,Radnine,2009-01-25 00:56:00,1538,"You know, I hate the cold. Hate it. But there are times when ice fishing looks so cozy, and this is one of them. Nice pictures. Jim"
296884,BUSTER,2009-01-25 01:48:00,1336,I wimped out today also
296888,BassAsin,2009-01-25 01:53:00,806,"walls are lookin pretty frosty in the flip over too! i can relate on being outside all day Clamp-it, although i had a fire nearby.   good job on the young one for beating ya'll"
296890,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-25 02:00:00,260,Was very cold out today.  I made it out myself to BOQ and didn't have a portable hut  No takers today but was fun to get out.  Thanks for your report and pics
296891,Clampet,2009-01-25 02:11:00,1947,"Yeah, I did. Kinda pathetic looking, it's embarrasing. "
296916,Sinker,2009-01-25 03:07:00,8692,"  Still better than nothing!!  Beats sitting in the wind all day, thats for sure!!  Sinker"
296921,jwl,2009-01-25 03:16:00,1056,"cold is an under statement, I was out in a buddy's boat for like 2 hours today and it was freeking cold..can I borrow your plans for that high tech wind break next time I head out??  Good to see I am, not the only nut job.  You guys caught a few fish and that's what counts right there, and sharing an adventure with the little ones is always enough to add soem warmth to the day"
296930,Jet,2009-01-25 03:32:00,364,"Good job getting out there. I also got out there today. The morning was cold but by noon it wasn't too bad at all with the sun beaming down. Like you the Perch weren't biting much. Managed 20 myself with only about 5 worth keeping out from Pefferlaw. I think Sunday will be better, too bad I can't make it out there tomorrow"
297031,Jer,2009-01-25 15:16:00,1426,"Brrr cold it was yeasterday.  Three of us were out with Mitchell's in Beaverton for perch. Thank God for a nice comfy hut. We had to wait awhile in the morning for them to get the Bombardier running, I think my cheeks froze off.  Fishing was slow with only about 30 perch coming out to play, about 18 of them were worth taking home for dinner but none were terribly massive."
