295610,Governator,2009-01-22 03:40:00,879,Well since I just started fishing last summer I never really thought or cared about what I'm drinking but as I kept getting up earlier and earlier to go fishing I started to appreciate Tim Hortons a lot more.
295643,sonny,2009-01-22 04:23:00,511,"I remember going fishing with my father when i was young and when we did he always bought ""tahiti treat"",,,wish i could find it now for when i take my son fishing!"

Second choice is a fishermans Coffee - 4 oz coffee, 2 oz Baileys, 2 oz Jack Daniels.  Silver Bullets - Tequila and Peppermint Schnapps   There's a story behind each one of them there drinks."

294557,Zubris21,2009-01-19 15:25:00,563,"I'd have to say coffee for the early mornings, black coffee of course, the only way to take it.  Then move on to water or iced tea later on in the afternoon.  Back on shore its onto the brews and maybe a couple Caesars."
294568,OhioFisherman,2009-01-19 15:40:00,6623,"Easy for me, tournament rules no alcohol in the boat, everyone I knew took it seriously. Most of the time a long drive home after a day on the lake, so it wasn`t a good plan after the tournie.  Places we went to for a two day might a beer or two back at camp in the evening but you wanted to be sharp for the next day.  Boat to me is like a car or truck, don`t have it in them, not in the boat. Fish give me a buzz!"
294572,lew,2009-01-19 15:44:00,12767,"I'm nearly always on the water at least an hour before sunrise, so a large thermos of coffee & cream gets me going in the morning.

294909,Jigger,2009-01-20 03:54:00,1237,Water on the water. BEER on the pier! 'Cept in the morning when two fingers of Irish make their way into the coffee. I might have a few out on the ice if I'm in a heated hut and don't have to drive. Then its probably rye. Maybe beer.

294364,Beats,2009-01-19 01:53:00,543,Beer is probably a popular answer.

Gets kinda dangerous some days in the summer but I never want to stop casting.  If I'm doing some relaxed fishing during warmer months I'll usually have a coffee or jug of water.  Oh.. and off the water after a day of fishing - let the beers fly down!"
