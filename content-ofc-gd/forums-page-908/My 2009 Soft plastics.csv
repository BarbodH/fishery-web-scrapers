294686,River Rat,2009-01-19 21:42:00,161,"90% of my plastics are in those deep compartment plastic boxes, along with hooks, weights, rattles etc. I keep one WAY over stuffed BP worm bag for those scented baits and gulps that need to stay in the zip locks. That bag is like 70lbs man, I am sure I have grown into a 2nd by now. They fit nicely into the deck storage on my bass boat and keep me organized by size, color and bait type etc. Plastics are a sick addiction once you figure them out.  Guys and Gals, please do all of us a favor ......please keep a can or comparment, container or whatever open when you are fishing plastics for the garbage baits......please do NOT throw that garbage in the lake. We all lose plastics on hits but when a torn bait is no longer usable, please for the love of fish, keep them on you boat and throw them away at home. I can only imagine how many fish die due to choking on those baits and not to mention, littering the water.  P.S....I have made some very interesting steelhead baits with my discarded plastics, glue, spike it dye, and a razor blade....heck, it's fun for the whole familly.  River Rat"
295123,rbaquial,2009-01-20 22:46:00,968,"QUESTION, If the plastics are scented, doesn't putting it in a box take away from holding on to its own scent?? (thats always been my conception) Can someone please verify this...."
295269,Cudz,2009-01-21 04:33:00,2652,"As for the original plastics.  There are a few plastics there that would not come out on the boat with me but to each their own.  You need to get some stick baits for sure.  Senkos or Yum dingers or Zeros or any of the stick worms.  4"" - 6"" sizes are a must.  I would also add in a few more tubes in different colours.  You do have a good start with some of the grubs but if it were me I would get some other colours, especially black.  I would also invest in some hollow belly swim baits.  3.5 - 5"" long.  I also like gulp alive leaches and minoows but they are kind a special plastic.  My primary soft plastics can be narrowed down to 4 types 1- senkos 2- tubes 3- grubs 4- swimbaits  I very rarely use any more than those with the exception of soft jerkbaits once in a while.  As previously mentioned I also drop shot a lot with gulp alive minnows and leaches."
295327,forrest,2009-01-21 14:04:00,1032,"The less environment polluting plastic the better.  Lots of fish can be caught on stuff that doesn't off gas in your tackle box to make every thing else stink, including the box itself.  Lots of fish can be caught without busted up used up plastics sitting on the bottom of the lake.  Gulp is biodegradable, I stick with that.  I have not seen any indications from Berkley or others about polluting chemicals in it.  There is likely something not so good in it.  Why don't manufacturers make enviro friendly baits?  According to a BPS article they do but their physical qualities are low compared to the polluting plastics.  So, Profisher I think you have enough real plastic in that picture.  forrest  PS Where are those enviro college guys on this?"
295337,Cudz,2009-01-21 14:27:00,2652,I have a bachelor of environmental studies from Waterloo. Not sure I 100% agree with all you said but you do make valid points about Gulp.  Not only do they bioderade but they also catch fish.  win-win situaltion.
295339,tinbanger,2009-01-21 14:30:00,1028,"Keep the used up baits on board . We use 'plastics' alot and only lose a few a year in the lake, most end up having to replaced due to wear and tear . Having said that I would guess our use of hardbodied baits vrs plastic increased last year . The gulp product is pretty good (use the minnows) and would like to see more products like that . ' Envirnomentaly friendly ' is a phrase that is way over used and abused these days.  You also could look at manufacturing processes ( raw materials used , waste ,pertro chemicals etc) shipping distance ( China vrs local manufacturer) packaging etc .  keep the lake and surrounding areas clean . We almost always haul back more garbage than we take out , especially ice fishing !  TB"
295373,Markystang,2009-01-21 16:29:00,131,"http://www.bigbitebaits.com/ Came across this the other day. They've got a whole line of what they call ""Biobaits""."
295407,River Rat,2009-01-21 20:26:00,161,"Bio-degradable baits are great, they are also expensive, and can't be stored along side the conventional plastics in the planos. Still, the benifits far outway the negatives.  I keep a BPS binder bag for mine....Gulp works great, Food Source is another company that makes them too and Nories will be coming out with a full line as well in the near future...from what I hear.  When the stick bait bite is on, BPS stick o's and economical and work well. When the stick fish get finicky, I get out the super supple dingers or quivery yamamoto's. In lock jaw or open water or deep water situations, craws on rock piles.....out come the bio's. I seldom run bio's in cover because they are too soft (non durable) and reaction triggers the hit anyway.......when the fish are taking time to sniff, I run bio's  I still see lots of people throwing used baits in the drink. Likely force of habit more than anything....I'm sure that will get better as word gets out that it is a bad practise. I used to see people leaving the boat launch with stringers of bass to take home, and those siteings are becoming less every year too. It's word of mouth and education.  See you out there  RR"
296463,Stoty,2009-01-24 03:04:00,2910,I'd have to agree with most things said about the plastics. Def get some senko-type baits. They are worth their price in gold on those tough days. I am going to switch to plano boxes for sure now!
296526,GoneFishin,2009-01-24 05:42:00,349,"Like said above, Yum Dinger (senko's) and GULP!!!! believe it or not... It catches fish .PERIOD! trust me you can not go wrong buying some Gulp Minnows, I guarantee you they will catch you something. Drop shot them and you won't believe you fished with out them."
293669,profisher25,2009-01-17 17:16:00,185,These are my soft plastics for 2009!  Your welcome to leave any comments or suggestions as to new plastics if you'd like!       
293679,Garry2Rs,2009-01-17 17:43:00,1425,"You don't seem to have any Senko 4 or 6 inch worms. The curly-tail ones you have are okay, but the straight ""Bic Pen"" style Yum-Dinger or Senko worms are my personal favourite.  You can fish them wacky or weightless Texas rig them.  For basic colours, I like Carolina Pumpkin with a Chartreuse tail, Watermelon with Red or Black fleck, Motor Oil, and Root Beer a translucent reddish brown colour that is called Camouflage by the no-name generic worm maker in my area.  To start the day, I try to match the colour of the worm to the bottom...green over weeds, browns over sand or rock."
293685,salmon,2009-01-17 17:57:00,334," Agreed You should get some 5"" YUM LPT dingers. Wacky worm style drives them crazy. My fav. coluors are black, blue and natural worm colours. Look into the Yamamoto worms too, but they tear very easily."
293701,bassjnkie,2009-01-17 18:51:00,1101,+ 1 on the Senko's. The ultimate go to bait.
293733,BillM,2009-01-17 20:32:00,17367,You need some Senko's and a better selection of tube jigs.
293767,BassAsin,2009-01-17 22:38:00,806,is that one of those bass starter kits from wal mart?
293773,bassjnkie,2009-01-17 23:06:00,1101,"I just have to add something here. Suggestions for any bait is not 100%. I use senkos a lot, but there are different sizes, colours and brands.What works for one person, doesn't mean it will work for you. The size of hook, the setup, the rod, the weight, will all affect you catch rate. Not everyone out there is using the same things, in the same conditions. All I am trying to say, don't spend a lot of money on wasted baits. Buy a few different baits that you think will work in area. I have so many bass baits, but I usually leave 3/4 of them at home.  Hope this helps,  Daniel"
293779,diggyj,2009-01-17 23:21:00,548,"I'd agree with what the others have said. I would add some 4 and 5"" Senkos in the Bubblegum color. Maybe some more tubes also.  Is it better to store plastics in their sealed bags or take them out and store them in a PLANO box? Will the dry out? Lose there scent?"
293783,River Rat,2009-01-17 23:26:00,161,"I don't think Profisher25 is fishing bass...are you ? Most of those baits look like walleye or crappy baits.  I thank the bass gods for being kind enough to provide me with the Senko, the Fluke and flappin shad, the horny toad / yum frog and the floating worm /trick worm.  RR"
293803,OhioFisherman,2009-01-18 00:31:00,6623,"Like River Rat mentioned, hard to comment or make suggestions with out knowing what your intended target is, and I can`t make out the size of the baits from the picture.  Personally I have no problems with the u-tail worms, I used Zoom ss u-tails myself (6 inch), a good bait and I have caught a number of different species on them besides bass. Ring worms are also a favorite on mine, 4 or 6 inch( I don`t consider 7 inch worms 7,they get labeled 6). Berkley Power worms are also good baits.  Lizards worked for me, 4 to 8 inch a bigger profile bait than most worms and usually a bigger average size fish. Sort of the original creature bait.  2-3 inch sassy shad or grub on a jig head is a good poke around to see what is in the area lure, a pre-fish lure for me for bass on strange waters, just want to catch something to see what is holding in the area. They will catch bass, I have also caught pike, walleyes, and just about everything else on them. Not my choice on a tournament day unless I am pretty confident they will put what I am looking for in the boat, just prefer a larger bait, unless they ain`t working.  Like others have mentioned, no one lure is going to work every day, doesn`t hurt to carry a mix of styles and colors."
293873,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-18 02:17:00,3761,"I don't think you have any of those killer Original Fishing Snakes there bud...They are one of the best topwater soft plastics out there  Along with those comes my reliable Yum Dingers, and then you will be all set my friend."
293912,Zubris21,2009-01-18 03:12:00,563,"If your targeting bass I would certainly pick up some yum dingers, They have worked excellent for me.  My preferred colours are the watermelon, bumblebee and I always have pink in the boat too."
293931,BassAsin,2009-01-18 03:47:00,806,"you forgot to mention ""storms"" 8*   lizard in a sandy brown!!!!!"
293932,profisher25,2009-01-18 03:47:00,185," No, actually, i just bought the box at BPS, and filled it up with a whole variety of bass, walleye, and panfish baits."
293933,profisher25,2009-01-18 03:51:00,185," Yes , you are correct, its made up of bass, walleye, and panfish baits! These are the main species of fish i target with soft plastics. The predatory species i usually target with hard baits, spinners, and spoons."
293939,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 03:58:00,8163,"You'll need lot's more 8 inch Lizards!... the females LOVE the 8 inch Lizards!!!  http://www.culpritstore.com/catalog2/produ...=11&type=13  The ""French Tickler"" of Lizards!!!"
294016,Fishnwire,2009-01-18 11:45:00,983,At my camp (north of Sudbury) medium power bait tubes (must be smoke coloured) is THE go to bait for huge smallies all July and August.  They gotta be smoke though...the smoke tubes get hammered non-stop while anything else produces many (I'm talkin' MANY) fewer strikes.  I think the smoke colour most accuratly mimicks a crawfish which all bass up there that time of year seem to be full of.
294062,limeyangler,2009-01-18 15:26:00,5204,  That was the question i was gonna ask!
294085,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-18 15:56:00,2585,my go to bait is a 4 inch yum dinger.  I highly recommend it or something simular  cheers!
294163,profisher25,2009-01-18 19:49:00,185,"To make things easier... the size of the lizard is, i believe, 5 inches, (fully stretched out of course) .. if you want to get an average estimate of the rest of the baits sizes."
294166,aniceguy,2009-01-18 20:00:00,1094,"this thread got me thinking so I paid a visit to the winter resting grounds of the boat to check a chip I bought for the new unit, pulled the cover and emptied 1 side of the compartments...I think I need to sell some stuff, on the other side sits 2 plano boxes of tubes, 2 boxes of jigs a box of jerk baits and crank baits and a box of frogs, never mind the 2 boxes of hooks....and Im not even going to talk about the dozens and dozens of bags in the front compartment "
294241,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-18 23:13:00,3761, This pic makes me want to take out all of my soft plastics out of their bags and put them in a container...
294304,OhioFisherman,2009-01-19 00:47:00,6623,"Mike I have kept most of my soft plastics in those style of boxes for years, some of the newer soft baits may need to be kept in their bags most don`t. Some baits I bought in quantities of one hundred or more didn`t come in zip lock bags. I put what wasn`t needed to load a box in a quart zip lock freezer bag and store them in 5 gallon buckets with lids."
294310,BillM,2009-01-19 00:54:00,17367,I am definitely going to get my plastics into hard containers this years.  Bags are such a pain in the ass.   Which plastics *shouldn't* go into containers?
