292700,Stoty,2009-01-15 17:22:00,2910,"Sweet, thats good to know Grimace. He says he has taken care of it, and has had no problem at all with it.  He claims 47 MPH as his top speed via the GPS unit. Stainless prop included!"
292761,purekgw,2009-01-15 20:20:00,585,i know how u feel i have always dreamed of owning a ranger GL with purchase
292787,aniceguy,2009-01-15 21:27:00,1094,"hirk is on the right direction and thats about 1/2 the stuff we can go through that day, ohhh I am bringing rabbit ears and tools to pull the plugs and lower unit drains. Dont worry while Im not a mrine mechanic I have been through a pile of personal boats and its more a matter of looking not for whats right but what looks wrong, Hirk is dead on if that power head looks as if the paint seal is broken your gettin dragged away lol ohh if we dont start the engine we also walk away, I would hate to see you get the screws on a boat inparticular a fine first boat that you have........now we need to get you to come to mississauga for some bass club meetings lol"
293092,Stoty,2009-01-16 13:20:00,2910,"Sweet, thanks dude! I really appreciate your help with everything."
293992,HTHM,2009-01-18 05:50:00,4082,So.....what happened???
294093,aniceguy,2009-01-18 16:10:00,1094,20 cm of snow made it a no go jamie and I talked quite a bit on the bill of sale and some warranty insertions....the seller agreed on them we will go up this friday as per plan
294140,Stoty,2009-01-18 18:34:00,2910,OF ALL DAYS FOR IT TO STORM!!!!!!!!!
294473,HTHM,2009-01-19 04:28:00,4082,Don't worry it'll be there next week as well. I have been sitting on a certain starcraft the whole winter waiting for the seller to blink.
294514,Stoty,2009-01-19 13:43:00,2910,"Hahaha, right on. Again...they are calling for snow Friday...grrrrrrr  Let's hope the forecast changes before then, cause I really want it this weekend!"
295852,Stoty,2009-01-22 19:32:00,2910,"Does anyone know of a marine place that's open past 5 pm on fridays, and works on Yamaha engines? I am picking up the Ranger tomorrow, and I have to get it looked at within 14 days to ensure everything is OK with it.  Ideally, I'd like to stop on my way back tomorrow and have it looked at.  I'll be going down hwy 11, then 400, then 401 east to Port Hope.  Any help is much appreciated."
295857,mikeh,2009-01-22 19:55:00,824,"I'd recommend you take the boat home during daylight hours and get it looked at on Saturday, I think you'll have a hard time getting someone to look at it Friday after 5 pm. I have never delt with them but Hastings Marine deals with Yamaha and they are not far from Port Hope."
295858,Stoty,2009-01-22 19:57:00,2910,"Ya, they seem to be the only ones that have time to do it anytime soon.  Thanks."
295914,misfish,2009-01-23 00:06:00,29133,  I would have to say yer going right by TopGun marine then.  You have Pauls number already.
296099,Stoty,2009-01-23 13:59:00,2910,"Today's the day!!!!! I meet ""aniceguy"" at high noon at BPS, to start our journey to pick'er up!"
296117,solopaddler,2009-01-23 14:33:00,8605, Good luck you must be stoked!
296119,Stoty,2009-01-23 14:34:00,2910,Thanks  I can't wait!  I think I'm on Cloud 4729472!
296136,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:11:00,563,Good luck Stoty.  Can't wait to see all the pictures once you have it!

292467,misfish,2009-01-15 00:37:00,29133,"Heres a question for you Jamie. Do you need it that new?  Are you trying to impress?  Look around. I,ll bet you,ll find something that can be an all around boat and still catch them green fish."
292470,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:38:00,2910,"Not trying to impress anyone. It's been a dream of mine since I was about 7 to have a Ranger. I am not in the financial situation to be able to get one.  I couldn't care less what people thought of me or my boat! No, I don't need a fancy boat to catch fish, but it will sure be nice!"
292475,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:41:00,1094,of course if we could convert you to a true bass boat there is a nice green triton around to catch them green fish you ll find the ranger and triton guys jab a lot lmao
292476,misfish,2009-01-15 00:41:00,29133," I beg to differ. I could of run my 18ft ranger with the 115 hard and pounded the Simcoe waves,but choose not to. But,there are others that would not give it a second thought.IMO Dont forget the pounding the transom takes aswell."
292478,misfish,2009-01-15 00:43:00,29133," Would you stop that,the wife is reading.LOL"
292480,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:46:00,1094,naw the waves needed to crack it IMO would have stuffed the bow way too many times and scared the pants off...dunno tritons dont crack so I just skip across them waves lmao
292481,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:47:00,1094, dang......I have been trying to get her email to show here exactly the next boat she should buy for ya come birthday time.....lol
292483,misfish,2009-01-15 00:49:00,29133," Chill dude. I was once like you too. I have learned though. Took me a few years but I have come to the thinking,I would like a bass fishing,laker fishing,whitie fishing,perch crappie fishing boat,with riggers. Cant do that with a bass boat.Well you can,but cost ya a pretty penny in fuel and upgrades.   AH HE LL LIVE YER DREAM KID,I DID."
292485,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:51:00,2910,"I'm fine....(the joys of not being able to hear a person's tone online).  In all honesty....I have no interested in laker, whitie or rigger fishing. I do bass/walleye/pike/musky/panfish, in smaller lakes. I don't hit up Erie or Lake Ontario. Kawartha chain mostly.  This is my ideal boat. Then...once I get an SUV...I'll look into a 21ft'er."
292493,misfish,2009-01-15 00:56:00,29133," Then why all the questions.LOL Those lakes will be fine................................ Just stay off of Simcoe,she,ll eat you alive.LOL  Just make sure you get an honest guy to look her over good for ya."
292497,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:58:00,2910,"Questions are regarding the condition of the goods being purchased, not whether or not it will run Rice Lake in about 13 mins flat, LOL.  ""ANiceGuy"" has offered to come with me to look at it, which is AMAZINGLY generous of him!"
292558,Stoty,2009-01-15 02:53:00,2910,"I talked to the guy on the phone tonight, and he seems like a really nice guy. Answered all my question very thoroughly, and knew what he was talking about. His dad owns the marina near his house, so all the maintenance was done through him, so its been well taken care of.  I feel good about the deal so far!"
292561,irishfield,2009-01-15 02:56:00,26272,"Sorry Jamie.. but I'll never buy a mechanics car! Oh..sorry to you too Bernie ! lol  Just go cautiously and walk away if anything doesn't go right. Be sure to take Louis up on his offer to be the ""leash man"" and pull you away."
292578,Bernie,2009-01-15 03:38:00,3190,"Regardless of whatever takes place. Take it to an independant mechanic for an overview. There was a thread here recently about a snowmobile. Remember that? Just because it isn't too old doesn't mean it wouldn't have some serious hours on her. Maybe the kid got a ""special deal"" on an engine the customer wanted a refund on.Not likely but it's a major investment. Get your moneys worth.     OK Wayne I admit my truck doesn't always get the TLC it used to. But that's merely cosmetic. It receives a generous undercoating and regular servicing. Just because the guys in the shop call it the ""toxic waste dump"" doesn't mean I don't like the old girl."
292620,Stoty,2009-01-15 13:39:00,2910,"He also said that if I brought the attachment with me, we could possibly start up the engine so I can hear it run (depending on the temperature). My buddy has the attachment, so I am going to bring it with me.  So between running the engine, and having ""aniceguy"" with me, that should hopefully give me a good idea about the quality of goods."
292623,BillM,2009-01-15 13:47:00,17367,I would have a tough time dropping 17k on a boat without actually water testing it...  Rabbit ears or a garbage pal full of water wouldn't likely show any issues if the engine had them anyhow.
292625,magicfingers,2009-01-15 13:56:00,37,just go with your gut feeling and dont let anyone scare you off the boat you want.Seems like you did your home work so feel good in the decision you make. I drove 10 hours to buy my last boat  in march with out even hearing it run. I think you asked a fair question about price and ect. so i dont know what all the grief is for. If this is what you want and everything checks out to YOUR standards buy it. just my 2 cents
292628,mikeh,2009-01-15 14:01:00,824,Stoty give Paul at Top Gun Marine a call and ask him about that motor and what to look for. Maybe ask him what it would cost to have one of his mechanics check it out or maybe he knows someone in the area the boat is located.
292629,Stoty,2009-01-15 14:02:00,2910,"Thanks MagicFingers, I appreciate that."
292662,hirk,2009-01-15 15:33:00,571,"Stoty take a guy with you that knows boats,if you can get a comp gauge you can check it yourself (warm it up 1st!!).Give the boat a good look and pull the cowling,pay close attention to the block gaskets and heads on ALL bolts,does it look like anything has been pulled apart/replaced or bolts with chipped paint or marred?This will tell you if it's been worked on,if it hasn't you can run it for piece of mind but as said that doesn't really tell ya squat except it starts/idles/revs,not how it runs under load etc..You are wise to ask the owner lots of Q's and pay attention to responses,sounds like you found your rig,G/L with it if you get it."
292666,Stoty,2009-01-15 15:48:00,2910,"Thanks for the tips Hirk. I will be sure to take a good look at everything. I'll let ""aniceguy"" go in with a fine tooth comb! hahaha.  Thanks again for any/all help from everyone. I didnt think this thread would be over 1,100 views, lol."
292672,Stoty,2009-01-15 16:04:00,2910," Oh ya?? Alright, leads me to my next question...... does anyone have one?"
292684,Grimace,2009-01-15 16:33:00,2020,"You can get one here.    hehehe.  Maybe if you wait a bit, it will go on sale.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...02563f78abb9cfa"
292691,Stoty,2009-01-15 16:50:00,2910,"Oh, sweet. I just might have to pick one of those puppies up!  Thanks very much!"
292695,Grimace,2009-01-15 17:06:00,2020,"Hey Stoty.    Just for the record.   I have an 06 Merc 115 4 stroke.  They were made by Yammy until the beginning of 07 or half way through, I can't remember.   Either way, my 06 Merc is a yammy.  It is bulletproof.  I have not had 1 issue with it at all.  So if this dude has taken care of it, you will have one fine motor on your hands.   I do not know haw fast it will push that fiberglass boat.   I have a 17.5 foot aluminum full windshield jobby and I can get 45 or so out of it, depending on the prop.   Stainless would be a bit quicker.  Good Luck man."
292204,charlesn,2009-01-14 16:08:00,551,"It works both ways.  I know guys with little boats always seem to want to have that little bit of extra speed, comfort, storage and safety.  The guys with the bigger rigs want a smaller rig that will be easy to fit in a garage, easier on gas and easier on the wallet.  If you're not planning on fishing any big tournaments in the near future, you will be totally satisfied with a 17 & 115.  My third boat was very similar to what you're looking at and although I'm on my 2nd 20 footer, I miss that 17 foot boat a lot.  I may even downgrade at some point as the options for big tournaments up here are becoming very limited.  Also remember, there are circuits out there dedicated to 115 HP & under, so if you fished one of those events, your rig would obviously be one of the top dogs and you'd be at no competitive disadvantage.  I also know what it is like to have a dream boat.  Mine was always Champion.  Picked my first up in Denton Texas after about a 21 hour drive.  I think I floated on air the entire tow home.  Still think fondly about it.  $17 is a very fair price on that rig.  Have a mechanic take a look at the motor if it is out of warranty for some peace of mind.  Also the trailer.  The boat itself is a Ranger, that speaks for itself and their customer service is legendary and warranted.  It is a great first boat and certainly not what most would consider a starter boat.  You will love it.  Once you are comfortable and want to squeeze the last few ounces of performance out of it, talk to Paul at Top Gun Marine.  He did wonders for all my little boats and is still the only person I trust with my boat and motor after 3 marinas I won't mention that tried to jack me.  You can ask misfish too, he dealt with Paul and he knows that Paul will do you right at a price the competition will not want others to know about.  Enjoy the boat!  Charles"
292215,mikeh,2009-01-14 16:34:00,824,"I know this is off topic but, I'd highly recommend Paul at Top Gun Marine also. He has fair prices and excellent service , I've actually taken my boat there and went for a coffee,came back and it was done."
292240,linweir,2009-01-14 18:06:00,202,Anyone can estimate price of a Yr.2004 Lund Mr.Pike 18 with same yr 150 HP & 8 Hp Yammy (both 4 stoke)? $20 K is reasonable?
292306,misfish,2009-01-14 20:46:00,29133,"Pauls a great guy,and does great work. Just one of the boys sorta speak."
292353,aniceguy,2009-01-14 22:15:00,1094,Paul I dont think if I recall works on yamaha engines though...or...did I miss that part
292363,Roy,2009-01-14 22:36:00,13728, Is that Jody Mills' boat in Parry Sound?
292381,mikeh,2009-01-14 23:05:00,824,"Paul at Top Gun Marine does fix Yamaha motors ,he fixed mine a couple of times last year. The first time I took my boat to him, I felt like I was getting the run around by another marina and he had me back on the water in three days."
292401,aniceguy,2009-01-14 23:29:00,1094,sweet thanks Mike
292445,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:17:00,2910,"Where is Top Gun Marine? I will be having a mechanic look at the boat (if I buy it), when I get it back home. I am trying to see if the guy selling it will hook up the hose to the motor or put it in a bucket, so I can hear it running.  Can you tell a lot about a motor by the looks of the inside of it? Are there things I should be looking for?"
292446,irishfield,2009-01-15 00:21:00,26272,If you mean INSIDE the engine by using a borescope YES.. If you mean inside the engine as in under the cowl/cover.. NO>
292447,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:22:00,1094,"yes have him show you the lower unit fluid, granted he could have changed it and such, a simple compression test on the engine and the lower unit should tell you what you need, I dont know if that engine has a diagnostic port on it to connect, if it does that would answer every single question on it.. the engine isnt that old look at the power head if it looks like it hasnt over heated ( chipped paint or a different color ) then it more then likely is ok, pull the plugs look for fouling, but again lots of these things can be covered up and a compression test by a mech is the best bet and well worth the 150 or so it will cost.  I would also ask who serviced it and go there and ask, also any reciepts on work done...I was lucky I bought my boat from a trustworthy person, and the marina that serviced it gave a thumbs up knowing the boat inside and out, but there are some that will sell crap that cosmetically looks ok a test tank or a run on muffs wont tell a darn thing other then it turns over and spits water"
292448,Terry,2009-01-15 00:23:00,14456,"just noreth of Bradford south of 89 just off highway 11   (905) 775-0862 Address : 2230-14th Line Innisfil, ON ,"
292449,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:24:00,2910,You can't tell if the motor has been looked after by removing the cover?
292450,misfish,2009-01-15 00:24:00,29133,"Top gun (905) 775-0862  Have a compression test done. I dont need to tell you this ,as Paul will tell you what you need to know.  You might want a marine survey done as well. Thier not cheap,but worth the 3-400 bucks."
292451,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:25:00,2910," Ya, he removed all the oil from the lower unit. Is that what you mean?"
292452,misfish,2009-01-15 00:25:00,29133,"Holly ,were all on the same page.LOL"
292453,irishfield,2009-01-15 00:25:00,26272, Absolutely NOT !
292455,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:27:00,2910,"I plan on having it looked at, but its a 3hr drive from me. It's been winterized each year, and all the necessary service has been done on the engine (so I am told). It's an '06 so I am sure it's alright."
292456,workwear,2009-01-15 00:27:00,592,compression test and a leakdown test!!!....both should be done proir to buying  have any idea how much a replacement motor will run.....still no garuntee it not blowin up on ya ....but a piece of mind none the less ....do it before you buy....17k is 17k   all the best with your new toy
292457,BillM,2009-01-15 00:28:00,17367," Not really..  Everything inside there will be clean, regardless if it's been taken care of or not."
292458,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:29:00,1094,"no no no an 06 is not ok even though it might have max 250 hrs on it, a blown power head, an accident on a rock etc.. can happen the test wont cost more then a few hundred bucks and is well worth it......"
292459,irishfield,2009-01-15 00:29:00,26272, Oh.... to be young and naive again! And I mean that in a nice way Jamie.  Take someone with you to look at it. Compression test can be done on site by cranking the sucker over. Leak down test can be done with a portable air pig.
292460,Stoty,2009-01-15 00:32:00,2910,excuse the stupid questions...but like I said..this would be my 1st boat.  If the oil and such has been drained....you cant crank it over can you?
292462,irishfield,2009-01-15 00:34:00,26272,The lower unit oil and engine oil had better have been replaced after he drained it. Nothing worse than an empty case and bare gears thru the winter/condensation etc. If he's leaving them empty thru the winter....walk.
292464,aniceguy,2009-01-15 00:35:00,1094,"the hull imo shouldnt have any stress crack issues....with a 115 I dont think it can go fast enough to pound hard enough a simple but hard look should tell if the hull was ever repaired, ( bright light looking for blemish or glass blending) but the engine is a whole diferent world..sure visually you can take a guess on the powerhead, looking at the plugs lower unit fluid etc, but lots of that can be masquaraded, compression test is the only choice, I would tell him thats your intent that you ll do the deal but on that condition and find a local marina up there to do it before any exchange of loot, if it fails its his bill it if passes its your bill to pay...IMO that should flush out his true intentions  and here I agree with wayne if there is no fluid in the gear case or if it hasnt been fogged I would raise the flag"

291936,hirk,2009-01-13 22:48:00,571,"Stoty don't pay too much attention to NADA values,their guide has more holes in it than a speed freak,the best thing is to comparison shop similar boats.I will second what niceguy said,you may find under 18' is VERY small once you get used to it and will not have the speed,rough water handling or stability at rest a 18'+ w/v-6 has."
291951,misfish,2009-01-13 23:06:00,29133," I can attest to the smaller boat/engine. I had the 350V Ranger with a 115. Great for the 2 footies like Milo said,but once the 3-4,s start,you can skip the first two,but that third can be a duzzie."
291980,SBCregal,2009-01-14 00:09:00,688,"trader.ca has a value finder for cars...not sure if it does for boats too, you enter make/model/yr etc and itl lists high/low and avg pricing"
291985,Stoty,2009-01-14 00:20:00,2910," Thanks for the advice but my truck is a street truck (Chevy Xtreme), so I am limited as to what I can tow. The 20+ full sized boat are too much for my truck. My life long dream has been to own a ranger, and this size is great for my 1st ever boat actually.  This isnt an upgrade from a 14ft tinny like someone said...this is literally MY first boat.  Again, I appreciate all the comments/advice though. Sounds like I am getting a good deal, that's for sure."
291992,trapshooter,2009-01-14 00:28:00,1234,Research that motor.  We had 1 at the lodge where I worked and for 2 years it was nothing but problems.  Our 90's were almost flawless but that 115 was a bugger.  I heard someone else say the same thing one time too about that 115.  At least ask the owner for the maintenance history to see if he's had to have it in the shop a lot.  Just an FYI and I didn't want to rain on your parade but when you're spending that much $$$ you want to cover all your bases.  Odds are it works well though.  Good luck.
292005,misfish,2009-01-14 01:01:00,29133, It was a joke me son.  Hope you enjoy yer ride if you get it.
292089,River Rat,2009-01-14 03:21:00,161,"dude, I don't know what a footistis is but if that means dragging more than one buddy along....forget it! I can barely tolerate a partner let alone a third of fourth person on my boat....even if it was 30 feet long. Anyway, it obviously depends on what water you are fishing 80% of the time.....big water will be a problem from time to time but if you can handle it, that ranger will too. Common sense prevails on the water bro,......live the dream, get the Ranger.  RR"
292092,Stoty,2009-01-14 03:32:00,2910,AMEN BROTHER!
292100,mikeh,2009-01-14 03:55:00,824,"If you always wanted a Ranger, then buy it. Seems like a decent boat. The gas costs go up when you move to a 20 footer and 225 hp (towing and driving around the lake)."
