296595,Terry,2009-01-24 14:44:00,14456,"ok to start with, it's cold out there I got up this morning, and my driveway was plowed in by the time I finished I was cold and back hurt, so I whimped out and will try fishing tomorrow  so don't bug me about whimping out...LOL  back to the question in hand  I was watching bob izumi and gord pyzer  fishing in ontario for pike with quick strike rigs with 2 treble hooks which I read as being illegal on live bait rigs gord is ex MNR, he should know????????????????????????? now I am thinking, they feel that because it has a couple of small spinners on it, it becomes a lure and each treble then is counted as one hook  but I have been told that that does not count...what ya think  poor quality  but I think you can see it <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/bob.flv"">    feel free to jump in Bob, Gord"
296605,Spiel,2009-01-24 15:06:00,9065,...Attaching a spinner makes it a lure which makes it legal.
296608,Terry,2009-01-24 15:15:00,14456,"I was also told that adding live bait to a lure, you then have to count each point as a single hook.....  I had a mepps spinner with a treble, I added a stinger  treble hook  and live bait a guy at the camp I was at said the MNR told him he had to remove the treble and put a single hook if adding live bait  I really wish the MNR would all read from the same book so we had the same rules with every CO out there"
296613,Greencoachdog,2009-01-24 15:21:00,8163,"Only 4 baited hook points are legal in Canada eh?  A jig is a lure, what is it when you tip it with a minnow?... 1 baited hook point?... or is it still a lure?  If the quick strike rig was made up of 1 single and a treble it would be completely legal."
296614,Spiel,2009-01-24 15:23:00,9065,  ....That there is certainly a problem. I believe it was Raf who said that different CO's have different views and/or  interpretation's.
296626,kickingfrog,2009-01-24 15:55:00,8333,Another point to consider is that in Northwestern Ontario they may just slip over the border and be fishing in Minnesota waters. That might change the regs as well.  As stated though... interpretation.
296632,Terry,2009-01-24 15:59:00,14456,"oh sure, confuse the issue LOL  I think they said they were in sunset country and I think that implies north west ontario....  I would really like a clear and forever and by every CO firm answer"
296638,DANIMAL,2009-01-24 16:09:00,215,"I'm pretty sure that in the old regs, adding a blade makes it a lure. But in the new regs it sounds to me like you are allowed to use 4 hooks per line wether they are trebles, singles,or used with bait or a lure."
296643,Moosebunk,2009-01-24 16:17:00,3970,"Watched that this morning too.  Gord sure has a knack for stretching his fish.  Don't much care whether it's legal or not... the rig suspends bait horizontal for a better presentation but... twice a hook got caught on the bottom of the hole and Bob had to dislodge it with his scoop, and twice did a fish come up with that second treble burried in the back of it's head.  Now I don't imagine these guys are going barbless, and that second treble could just as easily be stuck in an eye next time.  Not sure I like those rigs... would have to try the old way vs that style in waters with some depth.  That's where the horizontal presentation likely outshines a slightly more vertically dead quickstriked rig."
296646,Terry,2009-01-24 16:19:00,14456,you are correct the new regs. just state 4 hooks per line but as many COs have said the regs we read are a summary of the  complete regulations and not all laws or info are included in the summary but apply to all
