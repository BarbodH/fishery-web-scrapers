295757,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 14:31:00,8163,"When rigging a plastic grub on a jig, do you prefer the tail up?    Or the tail down?     Until recently, I always thought the tail should go up... but have found I have better results with the tail down. I believe this is because when the jig is worked/retrieved near the bottom the tail kicks up more mud/sand/debris giving it the appearance of a crawfish or baitfish fleeing.  I also like the tail down when tipping the jig with a live minnow... it keeps the tail from flogging the minnow to death.  How do you rig yours?"
295762,Leecher,2009-01-22 14:41:00,7832,"I always rig mine tail up.... don't ask me why  May be the reason is, I used to buy the ones that are prerigged at CT in packages and they're setup with the tail up.  I will certainly give the tail down a try.... Thanks Glen for that tip Jacques"
295773,Zubris21,2009-01-22 15:07:00,563,"I've always been a tail down fan myself.  Don't know why just always looked ""right"" to me.  If I'm not mistaken I think I saw a facts of fishing segment where Dave Mercer completely threw me off.  He flipped the grub over and rigged it so the tail was nearest the weighted head of the jig.  His reasoning was it gave the grub more action/profile one the bottom for the fish to pick up. never tried it though."
295775,Stoty,2009-01-22 15:11:00,2910," Not to mention it would keep those pesky panfish from nibbling off the end of the tail! Also, not a bad idea to increase your hook-up percentage on ""short"" strikes. The fish would basically be biting the hook, since there is no emtpy space between the tail and hook itself."
295778,OhioFisherman,2009-01-22 15:17:00,6623,I have always rigged them tail down.
295779,Cudz,2009-01-22 15:20:00,2652,"According to John Bondy (as stated in bassmaster magazine Dec issue i believe), you should always rig the grub with the tail curling down.  It is much less likely to get fouled on the hook. He has some other good tips in there as well with regards to grub fishing."
295781,DANIMAL,2009-01-22 15:26:00,215,"Tail up makes more action on the retrieve, but tail down makes more action on the fall. So it depends how I'm using it, but i mostly rig it tail up."

295823,jediangler,2009-01-22 17:24:00,1923,"I rig mine tail down, until the body is torn, then I flip it over and rig it tail up."
295826,Basspro,2009-01-22 17:29:00,11,I've always rigged my jigs with the tail up!   Never though of putting the tail down.  Will have to try it that way when the water gets soft again!  Mike
295828,shane,2009-01-22 17:39:00,652,UP!!!!      Any other way is wrong.    Is this going to become one of those console/tiller type of things?
295840,Dozer,2009-01-22 18:17:00,896,"Damn, thats how you put on those plastic grubs on"
295853,ch312,2009-01-22 19:40:00,1590,up? down?  what about to the left? right?  just close your eyes and thread it onto the hook. likely doesnt matter to the fish which way the tail is pointing...
295856,Victor,2009-01-22 19:52:00,1609,"never really paid attention to that until you mentioned it Glen ... but then I don't do much grub fishing. I think I would put it tail down. JMO.  Meh, lets just wacky rig it."
295882,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 22:04:00,8163," Me too Jacques! If you'll look at the prerigged ones, over 80% of them have the tail up!     That's a good point, I noticed that happening when I was rigging mine up!      Then your jig swims in circles and twists your line... not to mention looking real dumb to the fish and scaring them away!!!    I did the opposite of that, and that's when I realized I was getting more bites and catching more fish with it down.    That's ok fireball, maybe I can fish the back of the boat with you someday and show you all the fish you're missing!!!   Thanks for the replies folks!!!"
295898,ch312,2009-01-22 22:50:00,1590," thats why they have this new technology called a swivel  with the action you see from all kinds of crazy lures, i doubt it would spook the fish."
296010,Andy,2009-01-23 04:02:00,330,"Jigging down.  Swimming, alone or as trailer, up."
296046,singingdog,2009-01-23 10:36:00,1047,Down: less hook fouling and the tail moves better at slow speeds and on the fall.
296112,buckster,2009-01-23 14:25:00,530,I actually talked to a berkley rep....... and he told me to rig them tail down.......  But what does he know!
296115,solopaddler,2009-01-23 14:30:00,8605,Tail down always. It interferes less with your bait if you're tipping the jig as well.
296258,Whopper,2009-01-23 20:55:00,2174,I do both.  If I'm catching fish and loose a tail I'll keep fishing with em till I quit catching.
296264,anders,2009-01-23 21:10:00,1168,"never paid attention to that, i dont think that i will in the future.  I cant see it being any difference up or down."
296268,capt bruce,2009-01-23 21:17:00,820,"IF IM filping and bounceing it off bottom  I fish it SIDEWAYS so as to look like a craw arm and i think it slows down the fall alittle,  I was not jokeing , if im swimimg it I fish it tail up so I get the most thump.."
