I saw a new show coming from him and knowing his style and his outward helpfulness it should be a hit.  I ll bet his and Mercer's show will be 1 and 2 for canadian content on WFN"

296753,JPD,2009-01-24 21:02:00,296,"Thanks Louis... I didn't know they were running a promo until yesterday. The show with be called Getting School'd and it definitely has a different spin... more of a product showcase with great tips from pro anglers and cool new products coming out this year. There is a ton of information and is really geared towards helping people get the most out of the new product that hits store shelves every year. There will be a bit of on the water fishing at the end of each show but it will be focused on tips and tricks to help you load the boat your next time out.  The show will debut on Thursday, February 12th at 8:30 pm  JP"
