296051,Roy,2009-01-23 11:40:00,13728,"Those videos always remind me of those famous last words... "" Hey y'all, come watch me do this!""  Hiya Ric, nice to see you on board. Hope NY is treating you well."
296181,camillj,2009-01-23 17:03:00,1988,"Yes I say that the other day ... thats just WILD !!!  The real question for me is who was the guy who first said ... ""hmmm lets see if this will work"" .... and lived to tell about it"
296262,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-23 21:06:00,2582,Pretty Awesome....but there's not enough booze/meds on this planet to convince me to ever even think about trying it.

296398,FishHeadRic,2009-01-24 01:13:00,226,"Hey guys, l thought you'd all get  kick out of that.  Roy, How've you been? NY has been treating me really well. Been keeping busy making lures now that the winters here. Only a month and a half till the flounder season opens and two months till Striper season so I'm just cranking them out. Doing mostly Poppers and Bucktail Jigs but l'm also going to be venturing into a metal lipp swimmer or two. Always learning! I'll do a post later in the week after I finish up the ones l was doing for Snag. You should PM me your address and l'll get a couple your way as well. How have you been T.J.? Congrats to yourself and Jaden on her PAL test scores!  Ric"
