I was supposed to do this last night but had some 'puter problems last nite so here it is.  Let me know what ya think of the show every week and Ill draw a winner at random from the responses.  The winner gets to pick a T-shirt from Daves store!!  http://www.factsoffishing.com    
281502,TJQ,2008-12-19 12:52:00,7806,Heres one of the shirts!  
281981,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-20 16:35:00,3761,"WOW, that was a great show. Love the fact that you used a older bait, i myself have 3 of those lipless cranks that have never even saw water   maybe i will try them out next year.WTG Dave, can't wait to see u again next saturday on The Score!"
282035,SlowPoke,2008-12-20 21:09:00,2984,"I loved the ""mellow Dave"" part..... ""... and the fish appears to be digging...."". Another great show and nice to see the G3 in the background. I thought the support team was relegated to a 12' tinny with a 5hp viking. You really do spoil your crew Dave!"
282577,brifishrgy,2008-12-22 00:02:00,559,Another great show .. hard to believe those rattle raps actually work .. I have NEVER caught anything on mine .. gonna have to dig them out and give em another go
282796,Chrispy,2008-12-22 14:08:00,168,"Like all of the Facts of Fishing shows it was very entertaining!!  First doing an entire show on an old bait was awesome!!!   How many of us have older baits that were the hot thing of the season and forgotten in our tackle boxes??  I know that I will take the rust off some of the old baits and start throwing them....Mellow Dave was definitely funny!!!!  As always I find that I look forward to seeing a new Facts of Fishing show every week!!!  Keep up the great work Dave!!!!  Oh, and the comic book panels at the end of the show were cool too!!  Chrispy!"
282802,Handlebarz,2008-12-22 14:31:00,3790,I remember the first time I got one or the RR it was many moons ago and we would pound the crap out of the Smalies and eyes up north.  Dave I always find your show to be funny as hell and also very informitive as others have pointed out its great that you did this one on a old favorite. I love the intor for this one where ya take off to go fishing I know I can relate to that as many others should also how many times have I left the house for fishing and not got the chore list done???
283098,Markystang,2008-12-23 03:52:00,131,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again...Facts of Fishing is the best show on WFN...(even if I've never caught anything on any of my lipless cranks...lol...I'll have to give them another try I guess.)"
283379,TJQ,2008-12-24 00:14:00,7806,"OH YA!!

283472,Handlebarz,2008-12-24 04:10:00,3790,Dave asked people to let him know what they thought of the last episode if you gave your opinion on this thread then you were given a chance to win a shirt from the show. Dave then contacted TJ and said Dang its Christmas lets give everyone who posted on the thread a shirt I believe that you had to post before Dave said give everyone a shirt but thats just my take on it.
283475,TJQ,2008-12-24 04:29:00,7806, That is correct.
