295818,Tybo,2009-01-22 17:01:00,1373,"Soap or coolent, Weather stripping is the same material that coolent o-rings are made of. All oil based substainses will make the stripping brake down in time."
295844,OhioFisherman,2009-01-22 18:41:00,6623,Ya armorall works but needs to be done regularly.
295849,Beans,2009-01-22 18:57:00,3339,I find my pry bar does the trick !!!...
295850,Bernie,2009-01-22 19:08:00,3190,Careful with peeing on it. Look what happened here.  
295867,misfish,2009-01-22 21:00:00,29133,Graffite?????????
295897,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-22 22:48:00,0, okay I will help you out  Graphite spray   LOL!!!!
296274,CLofchik,2009-01-23 21:22:00,854,"Dupont makes a Multi-Use spray that works lightyears better than WD40 for lubing stuff. Some motorcycle guys swear by it for their chains, I've been using it pretty much everywhere you'd use 40.  Works great in the cold and is rubber safe.  Been using it to keep the dogs leash in the backyard from freezing up, stopped all the squeaks in my cars dashboard and has kept my car windows unstuck all winter (I'm a smoker, like to roll the window down before it thaws out).  Downside is you can only find it at a Lowe's.  "
296302,fishfarmer2,2009-01-23 22:16:00,76,Ok i use cooking oil on rubbers works great ok
295524,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-22 00:42:00,2582,"Love my 2002 VW Golf. But since winter number one with it I have had problems with the doors freezing shut. A mild wet spell followed by a quick cold snap and water freezes onto the weather stripping across the top of the door. When it is really bad I have to pour hot water on it just so I can open the door.....then towel it off real quick....PITA... it is.  Anyone out there have the same problems? And if so how do you remedy it?  Any and all help would be appreciated.  Regards, Steve"
295525,irishfield,2009-01-22 00:44:00,26272,My GMC truck does the same all the time and has the broken door handle to prove the pulling. Spray the weather strip with Silicon.. it helps but doesn't totally prevent it.
295526,Muskieman,2009-01-22 00:47:00,2472,Use white lithium grease on a rag and wipe down the weatherstripping and the inner door pillar and kick plate... works for me!..  2 vehicles 8 doors and haven't frozen yet!  RFS 
295527,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-22 00:51:00,2582, Just where might I find this magical stuff?
295528,douG,2009-01-22 00:56:00,2693,"Any auto supply shop or home maintenance depot will have it.  Shake the spray can well, it shoots out of the can like some sorta white gloop.  I'm just sayin'.  CTC or Home HdWr, Home Depot, Walmart, Rona."
295530,buckster,2009-01-22 00:59:00,530,You can get white grease at canadian tire.  It comes in a spray can.........
295532,misfish,2009-01-22 01:09:00,29133,"Never mind,I cant spell graghfite"
295547,pikehunter,2009-01-22 01:59:00,1659,"Move to South Florida. This will solve many winter problems, it's the only sure answer I have found."
295575,musky_man,2009-01-22 02:59:00,159,I've been told that PAM spray works well for that.
295577,snag,2009-01-22 03:02:00,1932,"Urine,  I'm not kidding.  Obviously for emergency.   We p'd on my dads Pinto for years before it got rear-ended and blew up.   Then the doors opened."
295579,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 03:02:00,8163,Leave your doors open!!!
295582,snag,2009-01-22 03:10:00,1932,  You have a PM
295584,Leecher,2009-01-22 03:10:00,7832,and also WD40
295600,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-22 03:32:00,10439,"Move up here, we don't get warm spells in winter!!!"
295604,Greencoachdog,2009-01-22 03:35:00,8163, You have one as well!
295606,Governator,2009-01-22 03:36:00,879,"Not sure if it's good for the paint or not, but I saw a guy at Canadian Tire who couldn't get in to his car because the doors were froze shut.  He poped open his trunk and grab windshield washer fluid.  He poured it over the door seal and the door opened with little effort.  Thought it was cool."
295641,sonny,2009-01-22 04:20:00,511,"i run into this quite a bit  when it gets  cold like this,,,silicone spray is the best but it is a maintenance this,,,spray the rubbers down once a week irishfield was right on the money!"
295658,BillM,2009-01-22 04:57:00,17367,"  Well seeing that 90% of your windshield washer fluid ends up on your roof anyhow, I am sure the paint would be fine  lol  Anything that doesn't freeze will work really, you could spray Windex on it if you wanted.  Chapstick also works good!!!"
295660,irishfield,2009-01-22 04:58:00,26272,Windex freezes... I have the solid bottle in the hangar to prove it.
295665,Bernie,2009-01-22 05:09:00,3190,"I would not recommend anything with oils in it on your weatherstripping. It may be absorbed into the rubber, expand it, and fall off. Silicone spray is the best option."
295669,BillM,2009-01-22 05:39:00,17367," Is yours diluted?  I've had a bottle out in the garage for a few weeks, it hasn't frozen yet."
295688,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-22 10:34:00,2582,  That doesn't sound practical....think of the commute?  But you did make me chuckle.
295722,Joey,2009-01-22 13:05:00,9122,"Well my quick fix for that, if you're in a hurry and need to get to work and the door is frozen, just pour some warm water on the door frame.  Works for me every time, and its free  Joey"
295801,camillj,2009-01-22 16:04:00,1988,Heh ... now you got me thinking ... its something I have been meaning to address for the Mrs' vehicle (as she gets to park outside) ... has anyone tried Armorall ... its made for the plastics/vinyl etc and leaves a real smoooooooooth skid area on hardwood (I have noticed quite literally by accident)
295803,ChrisK,2009-01-22 16:06:00,2772,I'll second the WD40....Works great !!  Cheers !!
