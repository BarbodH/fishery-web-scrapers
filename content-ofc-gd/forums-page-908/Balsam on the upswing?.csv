296028,Joeytier,2009-01-23 04:56:00,3990,"I realize this doesn't really apply to any recent fishing, but I've been hearing rumours about the walleye stocks in Balsam doing a lot better in the past season.  Did the strict limits have such an impact already?"
296033,Ramble,2009-01-23 05:56:00,713,"From what i have heard from a friend they had no problem catching 'eyes when ever they targed them. He caught a few big 'eyes on his muskey gear. I think mot are in the slot, but its helping.  -Dave"
296034,Joeytier,2009-01-23 05:58:00,3990,"I'd rather not keep eyes in the Kawarthas, anyway.  They're under enough pressure as is."
296035,kemper,2009-01-23 05:59:00,2232,"Not sure about Balsam, but I definatly caught many more on buckhorn this season intentionally and accidentally.  Actually found that I couldnt keep them off the bass lures around dusk!"
296045,Terry,2009-01-23 10:22:00,14456,I find the last 2 years the numbers and size have been way down
296049,Rich,2009-01-23 11:16:00,3927,"Walleye are very prolific in the right conditions, under a slot protecting adult fish it's possible the stocks could have gone up already."
296244,ranger520vx,2009-01-23 19:40:00,164,The restrictions on Balsalm Walleye have been in place much longer then the new limits Walleye are seeing on other Kawartha Lakes.  I think its in its 7 year of slot regs.  The fishing is always been good and I can say its better in the last 3.
