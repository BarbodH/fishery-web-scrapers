296790,Greencoachdog,2009-01-24 22:18:00,8163,Those are some good looking fish!!!  Even if it does look like they're nuptialating!!!
296793,RickOnt,2009-01-24 22:24:00,669,One thing I have to get used to With the HBird Flasher Was marking a LOT of Fish and NOT getting any Bites  Although  Last Year I met up with Big Chev and Lady W and  I think Looking at Lady W's Aqua View and SEEING the Fish and NOT  getting any Bites is Worst!!!!!

296799,Cudz,2009-01-24 22:41:00,2652,Congrats.  I got out today for an hour and got nothing.  Can you tell me what a hump back creeper is?  Is it a bad boyz jig or meegs or something like that?

296849,waterwolf,2009-01-25 00:33:00,556,"some gals just don't  understand ,,, being stubborn is a good personality trait.  way to go,, you were catching fish today if it was in the cards or not!!  make it happen!!  thanks for sharin'."
297037,Jer,2009-01-25 15:36:00,1426," Are they perchance cheaper than the Bad Boyz jigs. I went to buy some Bad Boyz on Friday, at $4.99 each, I only bought one."
297059,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-25 16:10:00,10439,  That's cheap compared to the price of them up here. Last month I bought 5 Badd Boyz jigs at the tackle shop in towm and the total with GST (we don't have PST here) was $27. Either you want to catch fish or sit on the side lines!!!!!!!     FYI The Blue fox jigs are usually a little less $$$$$$$$
