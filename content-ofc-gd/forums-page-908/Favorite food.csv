296352,Sinker,2009-01-24 00:05:00,8692,grilled cheese!!  I also like venvison or goose jerky or pepperettes.  I can't stop jigging long enough to actually cook something out there.......I'm lucky to stop long enough to wolf down a pepperette!!!  Sinker
296357,Leecher,2009-01-24 00:06:00,7832,Fish fry.... that is if you catch any before lunch
296389,Clampet,2009-01-24 00:54:00,1947,Apparently Cooks bay on Lake Simcoe will have a chipstand/burger shack on ice starting this week-end.
296433,bigugli,2009-01-24 02:06:00,6138,I'm usually too busy on the ice to be munching on anything.

296452,Beans,2009-01-24 02:42:00,3339,A thermos of chicken broth and a couple of spam g'weeches...lots of fat content to help keep you warm...some shortcake cookies...  unless...  You are at the Tyler G2G...then it is a sausage-on-a-bun mit saurkraut (worth at least a $5 donation)
