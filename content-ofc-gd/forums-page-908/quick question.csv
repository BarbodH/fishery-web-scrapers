291854,Roy,2009-01-13 20:02:00,13728,"At the top of the page, go to ""My Controls"". Scroll down the left side of the page you'll see ""Edit Signature"". The icons on that page will let you do almost anything you want. PLEASE ensure that the graphic you insert is no more than 75 pixels high by 500 pixels wide. Thanks."
