Which is both great arteries come out of the right ventricle instead of one right and one left. He also hase a sizeable hole between the ventricles. But all said he came home from Sick Kids last night and is doing great. His heartrate, breathing, and oxygen levels are normal. He will have to go for surgery in four to six months. He has to have check-ups every two weeks in the meantime. We're just so happy to have him home and doing so good. Very excited. Oh by the way he weighed 8lbs even. With lots of hair.  Thanks for reading.  Curt"
