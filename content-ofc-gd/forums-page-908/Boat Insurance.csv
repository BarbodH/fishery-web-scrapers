296164,justin elia,2009-01-23 16:19:00,151,"Does anyone know of an insurance company that will insure boats for the entire year without a lay up period so I can use it year round? I am currently with Aviva.  Here is the issue I have.  From May 1st-Novemeber 30th I am allowed to use the boat (put the boat in water). From December 1st-April 30th I am still insured for fire, theft and liability (while the boat is at home or I am trailering); however, once I put the boat in water I am not covered.  What I need, is to be able to use my boat anually.  Im sure alot of you fish the Niagara or go fishing in the spring for Salmon or crappies or whatever, so hopefully you should know a few providers for this type of insurance.  I have also spoken to a few friends that own boats who said that they had the insurance for annual use; however, one just found out that he wasn't covered during the lay up period for usage and the other was just ""told"" by their agent that they are covered which I am scepticle about.  For me, I want to see it in writing, so if anyone has a policy where it states clearly that you can use the boat year round and are fully covered, please let me know.  Thanks."

296174,John,2009-01-23 16:34:00,2956,"I am insured through State Farm, cars, home, umbrella liability and boat. It is insured for year round use."
296180,JenTavolacci,2009-01-23 17:00:00,68,Geico now insures boats but I don't know any details. I just saw the commercial.  -Jen
296187,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-23 17:17:00,10439,I used to be insured through Medovale Ins. Brokers. Give them a call.
296206,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-23 17:54:00,835,"Guys that travel might want to check and make sure you are covered in all the places you go, some limit you to an area. I would hate to pay for insurance you can't use."
296208,tonyb,2009-01-23 18:01:00,1637,My premium would double to go to year-round coverage.  My layup is from Dec 31-Apr 15 but I had to negotiate that...normal layup was Nov15th-Apr 15th.  I am with Marine Expert insurance.

296298,BigSmallie,2009-01-23 22:02:00,61,"State Farm is the only one that I know of that is year round, it's more expensive and does have some limitations such as no coverage for guiding. I'm with Premier Marine and it is a Dec 1st to March 31st layup period."

296426,Muskieman,2009-01-24 01:59:00,2472,"I have my boat insured under my house[at no extra charge] policy ING this includes fire and theft. I't's automatically insured if it's hooked up to a vehicle any vehicle..even yours.  I have no collision fire or theft for when I'm on the water or docked at a marina or something.  but what I do have is a 1,000000$ liability policy at 108.60$ /yr..    ING  if i hit someone or cause death to a swimmer or damage private property I'm covered.  If I hit a log or run aground   I take the loss.  RFS    14 ft Tracker SGV-14T/30 hp 'Rude"
296432,JPD,2009-01-24 02:05:00,296,"My boat is with CoOperators under the house policy Justin and you know how much I use it all year!!! Way cheaper than State Farm... give me a shout if you need more info,  JP"

296467,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-24 03:15:00,10439,"  I'm pretty sure that's who held my policy through Meadowvale Ins. Brokers. I had my boat insured with them since new with full coverage and it was covered for the full purchase price. I paid just over $300/year for my 18 footer w/90 hp + trailer, trolling motor and electronics."
296644,justin elia,2009-01-24 16:17:00,151,"Finally got it sorted out.  State farm confirmed what the few of you mentioned.  Covered all year, in or out of water.  State Farm offered a lower price for the entire year of usage than Aviva offered for April 1st-November 30th.  Live and learn I guess.  I've got a quote coming in from the Co-operators as well.   I've been quoted for 27K for replacement value, (19' 6"" Lund, 200 hp) 2M liability, covered for fire and theft.  $700 from State Farm  If anyone has any insurance contacts who think they can do better, fire away.  Thanks.  JP, flip me an email when you get back."
296671,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-24 17:20:00,835,Will state farm insure a boat without moving all your other insurance to them. They won't even talk to you about motorcycle insurance unless you plan on insuring another vehicle with it.
296682,justin elia,2009-01-24 17:40:00,151,They will insure just the boat.
296691,aniceguy,2009-01-24 18:06:00,1094,wicked deal Justin I emailed the broker just now
296701,Dartee,2009-01-24 18:28:00,47,"I'm with Gore Mutual and have all year coverage.  And I'm covered for all risks (fire/Theft /Collision, on and off the water which includes contents) with $1Mill liability. Premium is $220 for a 162 Prince with 40hp strk."
