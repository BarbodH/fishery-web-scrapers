Nice and light, very sturdy and fold up nice and compact  Folding stool  Can't wait to ditch those folding lawn chair. man those are hard on the back."
296692,Fisherman,2009-01-24 18:11:00,7201,"I think I would have to buy 2, one for each cheek, I think they are made for those of a skinny stature."
296698,kickingfrog,2009-01-24 18:25:00,8333,I use a folding stool sometimes. Keep in mind that if the snow is deep and/or soft the small legs/feet will sink into the snow.
296700,johnnyb,2009-01-24 18:27:00,3413,"Not a bad idea, Fang!  I currently use a lightweight folding stool, but it has no back support!  Always something more to buy for the gear pile, isn't there"
296731,Photoz,2009-01-24 20:06:00,792,Do ANY of the CTC stores actually stock 'em? (This should be interestin?')
296735,Stoty,2009-01-24 20:16:00,2910,"I just bought 2 of those last week, and they are sweet. THey save SO much room in a two man shelter! And they fold up so thin, I keep them right inside my portable hut when it's folded up!"
