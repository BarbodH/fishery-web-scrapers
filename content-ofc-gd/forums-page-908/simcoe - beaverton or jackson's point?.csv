296742,Sinker,2009-01-24 20:38:00,8692,"Nope, Floyd Hale doesn't run the operation anymore. Its not even a Hale that runs it if I remember right.  Try here:  Tim Hales Fish Huts, 705-426-9669, RR#3, Conc. 7, Beaverton, Ontario. L0K 1A0  He's got some great huts, and nice machines to get out and back. I've always caught fish with him, everytime I've gone out.  Sinker"
