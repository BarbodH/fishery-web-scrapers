We've been pretty much benched for the last 2.5 years, having an infant son to raise (), and so we haven't been able to travel with the boat to fish at all.  This coming summer however, with our son at the age of 3, my wife and I want to finally plan a week's vacation and fishing trip with the boat and our son.  I have a few criteria in choosing a place, in order of most important to least : Alternatively, we'd also be up for renting a private cottage if anyone knows of one that fits the bill !  Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks for your time, and tight lines ..."

296577,cranks bait,2009-01-24 14:04:00,721,If you are looking for something on the Larry.  Check this place out.  http://www.gananoque.com/caigers/  Quiet spot.  Awsome veiw.  good Docking.  Small beach.   They have a ramp to put your boat in right there.  Oh and it's in that area of the MacNair Muskie.  There's also a tackle/hunting shop just up the road incase you forget something.  There is a bike path as well that goes along the river for a nice evening walk or ride.  Feel free to pm me if you have questions.  No I am not affiliated with them.
296685,Billy Bob,2009-01-24 17:43:00,5865,I already PM you with one lake but I didn't see you were interested in the St Lawrence so if you can find a phone number of Green Acres Motel & Cottages on the NY side it is PERFECT for a family vacation with a provided dock on a nice and quiet bay PLUS a pool. Also have you considered Oneida Lake in NYS. It's really a walleye lake but I'm sure it holds Smallmouth and Largemouth bass. Here are a couple of websites in you are interested in fishing NYS for the above mentioned areas.  http://realtravel.com/h-198554-clayton_hot..._motel_cottages  http://www.fishoneida.com/  I FOUND the Green Acre Website. see below  http://www.swanbaybeachclub.net/accommodations.htm
