295918,Sinker,2009-01-23 00:13:00,8692," Hey Cliff,  I was out on a bike today. There were a few spots where it was working hard in the drifts, but its totally doable. I was riding double on the back. If we get this bit of mild weather, then the cold, it should firm the snow up a bit better for quads. No probs on a bike though. If your off during the week and want to head out, get in touch!!!  Sinker"
296072,solopaddler,2009-01-23 12:56:00,8605,"Good job boys, some nice fish there! Looks the fish were really inhaling your lures in some of those pic's."

295608,Sinker,2009-01-22 03:39:00,8692,"Met up with Buckster this morning for a little simcoe fishing. We hopped on his hot rod of a sled, and headed out.  We werent there 5 mins and Tony had a fish on.    He got another one in a matter of minutes, and things were looking good. I  was starting to get worried, but hooked into our target .........a nice whitie. I thought we were going to get into the whities really good, but they just didn't want to play........or the lakers scared them off.....I dunno  We were marking lots of fish, but most of them turned out to be lakers............not that I'm complaining  We had a fun day out there. We got a few pics of some of the fish, but not all. Most went right back down the hole. We had to work for our whities, but we got them in the end.  Heres a few of the lakers we got.  Buckster with a nice fatty.    Yours truly....        A couple hole shots.....      Double limits......    It sure was a fun day out there. A little windy and cold and snowy, but we were kept busy  Team 8 has a couple entries in the tourney as well  Sinker"
