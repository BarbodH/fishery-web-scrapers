296101,chickenhawk,2009-01-23 14:04:00,612,"Well, now that the world junior excitement is over it has me wondering what our olympic team in 2010 is gonna look like....here is my predictions.....all others are very welcome  FORWARDS Iginla Crosby Heatley Spezza Nash Thornton M. Richards Getzlaff E. Staal Gagne Levaclier St. Louis  DEFENCE Phaneuf Pronger Campbell Redden M. Green Jovanovski  GOALIES Luongo Giguere Brodeur  OTHER POTENTIAL GUYS M. Savard S. Doan C. Perry R. Smyth J. Toews D. Keith C. Phillips C. Ward  What do you guys think? what would you change or not change.....can't wait to see some other predictions...."
296103,Stoty,2009-01-23 14:09:00,2910,"JEFF CARTER!!!!!  Not too sure about Giguere. Maybe Fleury/Price?  Other than that, you have pretty much the team picked!"
296107,chickenhawk,2009-01-23 14:16:00,612,but who would you get rid of to add in jeff carter?
296118,Stoty,2009-01-23 14:33:00,2910,with the way he's playing lately.....Spezza  St. Louis is also not living up to his ability.
296129,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:05:00,563,"Definitely Carter over Spezza.  Way better team guy!  and I doubt Giguere will be there, I agree Fleury or Price.  Also I wonder if Brodeur will still be at his peak when the Olympics roll around."
296130,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:06:00,563,"And just too add another name into the fire, how about Jay Bowmeester?"
296140,anders,2009-01-23 15:18:00,1168,"I'll Play  Heres who i would pick  Centres:  Thornton, Crosby, Getzlaf, M Richards  (other - Savard)  Wingers ( and yes lots are centres but they need to know there role): J. Carter, Lecavalier, Nash, Marleau, Iginla, Gagne, Heatley, Toews (other - E Staal)  Defense: Phaneuf, M. Green, Campbell, Boyle, Keith, Weber (other Doughty)  Goalies: Luongo, Turco , Ward (other Fluery, Ellis)   There you go, pick em a part, but i think they need to bring some young guys, like they have in the past that will be the go to guys in the future. They may not play much, but having them there would be beneficial."
296144,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:33:00,563,"I agree with the young guys needing to be there.  Good call on Shea Weber, he will likely be there.  Can't say I agree with Turco or Ward though.  I think Price or Fluery are more likely to be in the backup spot."
296176,Evan Gallimore,2009-01-23 16:43:00,37,Hawk must not be cathin anyfish lately. Need to talk about somthin!...LOL
296177,chickenhawk,2009-01-23 16:53:00,612,lmao u know me too well gallimore! take me fishing!!!! i need to know what it's like to catch a steelhead....oh wait i've caught one this year over 5 lbs!!! HOORAY FOR ME!!! lol but seriously gallimore....when are you gonna continue the lessons you left me with last spring???
296186,kemper,2009-01-23 17:16:00,2232,"Lots of good calls, but what about steve mason?  I think you could see him in the backup spot the way hes been playing  Also think toews will see the ice"
296193,chickenhawk,2009-01-23 17:37:00,612,"mason will be too young still in my opinion....maybe in 2014 he will rise as an elite canadian star....as much as i'd love to see Tavares there next year that prolly won't happen either same with Patrick Sharp, Cody Hodgson, Jordan Eberle.....all players im sure we will see in 2014.....should be an exciting tournament"
296200,anders,2009-01-23 17:48:00,1168,"those guys are all going to be rookies next year, except for Sharp and there is no garantee that those players will be in the NHL even.  Even Tavares might not crack a lineup (good chance he will) but he is still a rookie.  Those guys wont even get a sniff.  Mason...Maybe...but there are too many good quality young goaltenders before him."
296211,kemper,2009-01-23 18:10:00,2232,"  Ive been watching tavares for 4 years (seasons tickets), and the kid is the real deal.  Watch the numbers he is going to put up for london during the rest of the season, first star his first three games out there."
296222,JohnAB,2009-01-23 18:33:00,178,"Goalies: Brodeur, Luongo, Price  Defense: Pronger, Phaneuf, Campbell, Green, Bowmeester, Regehr,  Centres: Crosby, Getzlaf, Thornton, M. Richards  Wingers: Iginla, Vinny, Heatley, Nash, Carter, Toews, Gagne, Perry"
296232,chickenhawk,2009-01-23 19:00:00,612,i totally forgot about regehr a good hard hitting defenceman....and also cory sarich would be a good guy to look at too.....
