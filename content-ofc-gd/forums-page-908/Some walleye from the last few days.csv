296527,Cudz,2009-01-24 06:06:00,2652,LOL When I said twin and both catching I was doing so tongue in cheek.  It is very hard to tell on the computer unless I stated it. Nice eyes though.  That part I was not kidding about.

296603,WeedLine,2009-01-24 15:03:00,322,Those are some quality eyes! Great job and good luck on the lakers.

296689,centerpin_drift,2009-01-24 17:55:00,94,thanks for rubbing it in our faces that your fishing eyes on lac seu.  great report and great fish
295991,trapshooter,2009-01-23 02:45:00,1234,"I've been spending a lot of time lately chasing walleye with my buddy Graham up here in Northwestern Ontario.   We're putting a lot of km's on the sleds and a lot of holes in the ice.  There's a spot on Lac Seul that we've been spending most of our time at over the last few days.  It's a channel with some current and a relatively flat bottom in 27 FOW.  The fish seem to use it as a highway, passing through fairly regularly.  Jigs have been outproducing spoons for me lately.  I'm really getting some confidence going with the horizontal jigging baits like the Foxee jig and the jigging rap.  Set lines with small jigs and small minnows have taken the bigger fish, however.        A couple nice ones for graham.  25"" from last night.   28"" first thing this morning.   Fish fry tomorrow night then time to chase some lakers this weekend."
295998,Sinker,2009-01-23 03:05:00,8692,Nice work guys! Those are some beauty pickeral!!!  Sinker
296004,rob v,2009-01-23 03:18:00,535,Beauties !!!    ... wish I was there !

296008,tknohpy,2009-01-23 03:50:00,162,Nice eyes!  How do you like the Hummingbird?
296014,Cudz,2009-01-23 04:26:00,2652,"wow, very nice. In your last pic it appears that both you and your twin brother caught big walleyes.  Well done to both of you."
296017,tdotfisherman,2009-01-23 04:38:00,317,Nice report.. always nice to see those big Lac Seul 'eyes
296022,limeyangler,2009-01-23 04:46:00,5204,"excellent stuff Ben, i'm not jealous at all...lol  just glad you'll be there Sunday so i can learn a bit of that fish catching know how from ya.....and paln to join ya fior some lac seul action ibn the next couple of weeks, like you said we're not more than 1/2 hours drive away if we meet in the middle."
296023,Joeytier,2009-01-23 04:46:00,3990,"This report is really making me anxious for getting onto Quinte.  The eyeless-waters of Scugog have been less than satisfactory, to say the least."
296031,brkygetr,2009-01-23 05:17:00,425,"nice Ben..I'll meet ya sunday your a trooper for chasing the walters in the winter...  Lotta holes, lots!"
296055,solopaddler,2009-01-23 12:20:00,8605,Awesome Ben. Are you tipping the horizontal baits or running them clean?
296060,b2kptbo,2009-01-23 12:40:00,1505,"WOW, some nice ones 4 sure, good stuff..."
296065,tinbanger,2009-01-23 12:44:00,1028,Nice fish guys  Thanks for the report  TB
296073,corvette1,2009-01-23 12:59:00,1765,nice eyes congrats cant wait for the lakers
296075,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-23 13:00:00,1362,Wow...those are some real beauties   .....congrats!!
296078,Spiel,2009-01-23 13:03:00,9065,....You got my attention. How many kliks from Hamilton to Lac Seul......
296091,Leecher,2009-01-23 13:47:00,7832,Great report and pics Ben  Congratulations to both of you     Real nice fat eyes Thanks for sharing Leechman
296100,trapshooter,2009-01-23 14:01:00,1234,"Thanks for the kind words everyone.  tknohpy - love the Hbird.  This unit brought flasher technology out of the dark ages.  Cudz - I'm not in the last picture.  Both Graham with the same 28""er.  2 photo's are stitched together.  Simon and Brkygetr - Really looking forward to Sunday and chasing lakers on Big Sandy.  Solo - I'm tipping them.  The walleye are not very aggressive at this time of the winter and you need some meat to get them to commit.  Even with the meat, it's still a very light bite most of the time.  Spiel - not far at all.... @ 2000kms.  Let me know when you're arriving"
296106,buckster,2009-01-23 14:15:00,530,Yup about 2000km is right i did the drive once lol.......  Good going guys!   I just love that lake!  its a pic factory!
296141,Spiel,2009-01-23 15:19:00,9065, ....Well it won't be this winter but I have every intention of spending some time ice fishing up that way after retirement.  If I remember correctly I drove past the exit to Lac Seul on my way to Vermillion Bay.
296145,trapshooter,2009-01-23 15:35:00,1234,"If you were in Vermillion Bay, you were close.  You can access Lac Seul from here in Sioux Lookout, from north of Dryden and from Ear Falls.  The VB turn off goes up to Ear Falls.  Let me know and I'd be happy to show you around or give you some info if you're going to a different part of the lake."
296146,Zubris21,2009-01-23 15:40:00,563,great fish!  thanks for taking the time to share!
296495,ehg,2009-01-24 03:59:00,2666,Those are some nice walleyes
296521,chilli,2009-01-24 05:19:00,199,Beauty colour on the big ones. Is that a photoshop or were those 2 walleye twins?
296522,trapshooter,2009-01-24 05:22:00,1234,It is the same fish.  Just 2 different photo's stitched together.
