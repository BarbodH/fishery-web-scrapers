296269,Terry,2009-01-23 21:18:00,14456,"Well I have not tried for whitefish and trout this year, so I guess I will go out from  between willow and  jackson point and will try spots from other years where is everyone else going,"
296278,misfish,2009-01-23 21:29:00,29133,"Yer going where,when,have you seen the temps that are coming,let alone the wind chill???????????????? It,s going to be cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DANG COLD. I,LL JUST STAY HERE AND BE WITH MY WARM COMPANION."
296286,Terry,2009-01-23 21:41:00,14456,I think they are only calling for a low of -17 if you can believe weathernetwork
296295,Governator,2009-01-23 21:57:00,879,They are calling for -20 sat morning with windchill feeling like -30 (At least here in Barrie).  Can't imagine what it'll feel like on the lake.
296297,BUSTER,2009-01-23 22:01:00,1336,id love to pull up a laker! maybe ill head out?  lets see............. lay hard wood in living room or fish simcoe? ahhh  decisions?
296325,raysfish2005,2009-01-23 23:16:00,163,"Well i'm going to take my little girl out for some perch, i was thinking lakers and whites but i dont think with the cold from comming that there will be to much caught, so perch it is and she will be happy pulling them in. I'm going to take the qaud, there is no way i'm pulling my flip in thats snow again, hhm have to putthe chains on the quad."
296331,linweir,2009-01-23 23:31:00,202,"I tried to book a hut from one of ""my"" operators, but they're full."
296377,Jer,2009-01-24 00:36:00,1426,We're headed to Beaverton out with Mitchell's to their perch huts. Hope the cold snap doesn't shut the bite down.
296404,ozaibak1,2009-01-24 01:28:00,401,"Not going fishing because its too cold on the body is a valid reason, but not going because the bite wont be on because its cold is not! I went last Saturday with the exact forecast conditions: relatively warm (~0C) dipping to -18 low, and the bite was on!!! Was fishing for perch though."
296454,waterwolf,2009-01-24 02:46:00,556,"man ,, i don't mind the cold at all ,,, it's the dang wind that  spoils the party.   scimmin' holes is no problem ,, bringin' one on the ice is no problem. performing a delicate surgery on a beauty pike with a deeper than perfect hook-set in a howling gail when time for that big girl is an issue ,, is a damn near emergency , even on a small lake . simcoe with the gails ,, -15 to -17 could be a rough ride . be safe ,, be smart. i might stay home too!   maybe."
296455,Fisherman,2009-01-24 02:50:00,7201,"There's a white out snowstorm about 10km west of Barrie right now, might be hard sluggin tomorrow."
296461,Terry,2009-01-24 02:56:00,14456,"yeah, it's snowing like hell in Bradford right now  I might be watching it on tv instead of doing it on the ice  I haven't been on the ice in that area this year, I don't like traveling blind with all the fresh snow"
296464,misfish,2009-01-24 03:04:00,29133,"Bud it,s blowing and snow is too. Ah winter,ya got to love it. Now back to my $360,000 in holdem. 5 minute rest is just about up."
