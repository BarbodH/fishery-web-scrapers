296817,pigeonfisher,2009-01-24 23:27:00,696,"Hey all,  I think we may get the program tonight.  I am possibly the last person alive still paying for these things...  who are the winners?"
296820,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-01-24 23:35:00,135,Unfortunately GSP doesn't fight until next weekend.
296829,forrest,2009-01-24 23:49:00,1032,"Yep, next weekend.  Tonight it is Steve B's brother and another fight with Fedor E and Andrea A.  forrest"
296830,Greencoachdog,2009-01-24 23:50:00,8163,"Isn't all that ""watching big sweaty menzes in clinch"" kinda G-A-....?"
296835,forrest,2009-01-25 00:03:00,1032," Only if your calling the fighters ""menzes"""
296838,misfish,2009-01-25 00:09:00,29133," The mrs,s dont seem to mind.  As for GSP,I think.he will have his hands full with Penn. Penn is one tough dude."
296844,Terry,2009-01-25 00:21:00,14456,"GSP, may be pound for pound the best fighter out there"
296846,misfish,2009-01-25 00:27:00,29133, No questioning that. Im just saying that Penn is no push over.Be interesting to see if GSP can open him up with a strike game. I have to give the ground game to Penn.
296848,Terry,2009-01-25 00:31:00,14456,"oh yeah, I think its going to be a  great fight"
296850,ironstone74,2009-01-25 00:40:00,201,There is an Affliction fight card on tonight.  Starts at 9:00; headliner is Arlovsky vs. Emallianenko.  It's on the dish or Pay Per View. Should be a beauty.  Can't wait to see GSP dominate BJ Penn.  Paul
296852,Greencoachdog,2009-01-25 00:40:00,8163," Yeah, reminds me of the 3rd review in this clip....  "
296857,pigeonfisher,2009-01-25 00:50:00,696,I was just trying to get a head start...  Of course I knew it was next weekend....hahahahhahahaa
