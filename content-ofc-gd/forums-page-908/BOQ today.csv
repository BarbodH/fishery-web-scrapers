Picked up some nice minnows at Carras in Belleville.  Headed out from Zwicks park by the bay bridge as there were some huts and other cold fools standing around outside there   was -16C when I walked out.  Figured I may as well try there as I have not been on the ice here since the early eighties  The walk out at first was a little tough given the deep soft snow.  Punched a bunch of holes, had something take some minnows but did not ice any fish.  Average 8 - 10 inches of good solid ice.         Was great to be out on such a sunny day.  The boys and girls from CFB Trenton were training most of the day with the new C-17 so I got to enjoy that for a while.  Packed up there and drove over to Trenton.  Same ice conditions there but a lot more people fishing right on the mouth of the Trent.  I spoke with several people who also got nothing all day.  Maybe next time I will have more luck.  A slow day fishing sure beats any day working  One thing is for sure:  Cold doesn't bother me but a shelter or hut would be real nice"
