296494,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-24 03:59:00,0,"Phone hydro. If you changed the fuses, could be outside. Can't say for sure with out testing at the panel.  good luck. Don't wait to long....lol"
296502,Sinker,2009-01-24 04:22:00,8692,"We had that happen here too. The ground from outside burnt off, so we only had 100, of our 200amp service.  Phone Hydro......they'll set you up temporary until they can get er done right.  Sinker"
296505,Ziki,2009-01-24 04:26:00,128,check your fuses
296508,HTHM,2009-01-24 04:29:00,4082,"call hydro and cuddle with your wife, that will keep you warm till the morning when Hydro can respond Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, know what I mean eh??? (obvious Monty Python reference)"
296510,Sinker,2009-01-24 04:32:00,8692,Hydro came for us right away. Within an hour.  Sinker
296545,Big Cliff,2009-01-24 12:34:00,6899,"I have a portable generator, only 1000 Watts but might be enough to run your furnace, call me, I'll bring it over 328-0750"
296561,Guest lundboy,2009-01-24 13:26:00,0,"Probably half the panel is out.  All breakers down one side.  This could be caused by arcing in the panel (dirty contacts on the bus bar) or it could be as others have said an outside problem with a leaky line coming in or a break.  call hydro first, if they don't find anything then call an electrician."
296569,ecmilley,2009-01-24 13:42:00,2163,"on your panel check the main breakers/fuses on the side not working,if hydro doesnt find nothing, I can help later saturday, not a liscenced electriction, but can usually repair without much of a problem"
296576,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-24 14:03:00,260,sounds like one phase is down on your service.  all kinds of electrical problems this week in the kawarthas...I have seen more blown up stuff this week than I would care to count.  Call hydro one.
296726,steverowbotham,2009-01-24 19:58:00,1800,"We fixed it. We bought it as a rental unit, so there were 2 seperate fuse panels ... one of the cartridge fuses on the main breaker switch had gone, replaced it and we're golden.  thanks for the advice, and big cliff, thanks for the offer."
296795,Spiel,2009-01-24 22:31:00,9065,"  ....That there is still something to be concerned about, those fuses don't generally blow for no reason."
296801,Whopper,2009-01-24 22:43:00,2174," Chris you are correct, although every once in a great while it does happen.  If it happens again get it checked out by someone who knows what their doing"
296827,Greencoachdog,2009-01-24 23:43:00,8163,"  What does an ""office boy"" know about being an electrician?... besides burning their eyeballs out of the sockets when they don't "" lock out, tag out""???"
296877,steverowbotham,2009-01-25 01:42:00,1800," We had an electrician in to fix it, and he lives in the building.  Doubt he'd want to see problems in his own building"
296886,Daplumma,2009-01-25 01:50:00,1961,"Tighten up the connections,fuses and breakers go from heat or over amps.Heat can come from loose lugs.Check that if your electrician bud did not,said the plumber. Joe"
296894,Whopper,2009-01-25 02:14:00,2174," Wasn't born behind the desk, turn screws with the best of em for a very long time.  As far as burns, poop happens"
296998,Baldy,2009-01-25 12:39:00,44,"It is still worth checking out the entire panel.  If it was a branch circuit that had a problem then the smaller breaker or fuse should have tripped first.  There are a few reasons why that fuse would have faulted, loose connections being the number one.  Also worth checking to see if the house was wired with aluminum cable, notorious for termination problems i e arcing & overheating due to loose connections. I have seen too much burnt wiring and charred equipment.  Better to be safe than sorry."
297000,Big Cliff,2009-01-25 12:44:00,6899," Anytime neighbour! Just remember I work for a rental company, If we have it and you need it, you got it!"
