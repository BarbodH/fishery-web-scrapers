296910,rbaquial,2009-01-25 03:02:00,968," I'd love to go fishing on the water! I use to go with a buddy of mine, but he moved to the states, and took his boat with him! How much would I be looking @ spending for  TINNY and a 9.9? (either new or old)... I'd need a TRAILER, wouldn't I? (or would that depend on the size of it?)"
296942,Cudz,2009-01-25 04:01:00,2652,About $1500 will get you a decent one with trailer.  NOT NEW though.
296813,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-24 23:14:00,3761,"Very nice selection of lures. I am also a shore angler and have not even half as many baits as you have, guess you might have a few more years of collecting on me though . From what i have i had good success with the x-rap slashbaits last year in the start of the bass season until i lost my baits to snags, and i see you have good numbers of these lures. Also look and try out the gold, and the purple ghost colors on those x-raps. Also a ideal topwater poper would be Rapala's Skitter Pop. I bought a cheeper BPS poper and it just was not the same, so again i strongly suggest the skitter pop. Aside from that you seem to have pretty much everything covered with the exception of more dinger/senko type lures and maybe 2 or 3 bass jigs to try out!"
