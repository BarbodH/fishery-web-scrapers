46035,easton13th,2007-03-12 15:47:00,371,Hello All;  Great site as to what I have seen so far. I was introduced to the site by a couple of existing members.  I am mostly a Bay of Quinty area Pickerel angler. Not objecting to some bass and pike when the pickerel are not hitting.  There is nothing more I enjoy than a day on the lake with family and friends.  Looking foward to interacting with the members on the site. Sharing good and bad fishings days. (if there is such a thing as a bad day fishing). and stories of the ones that got away.  Looking forward to another great season starting in only 53 days.....Tournament on Bay of Quinty..  Good luck to all.  Easton
