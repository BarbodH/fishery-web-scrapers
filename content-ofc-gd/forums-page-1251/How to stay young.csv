Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down. (Keep this in mind if you are one of those grouches!)   3. Keep learning: Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain get idle.  ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" And the devil's name is Alzheimer's!  4. Enjoy the simple things   5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. And if you have a friend who makes you laugh, spend lots and lots of time with her/him !   6. The tears happen: Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is our self. LIVE while you are alive.  7. Surround yourself with what you love: Whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.   8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.  9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.   10. Tell the people you love, that you love them - at every opportunity."

My wife was laughing so hard she had to leave the room.  She assured the neuro I wasn`t suffering from depression though!"

47772,huey graphite,2007-03-16 11:16:00,362,  That's hilarious!  Caffeine Enema I've never heard of. Yogurt yes but caffeine.....never!
47777,OhioFisherman,2007-03-16 11:30:00,6623,The really funny part was she was falling for it. She was ready to ask the doc about it.
47801,just2manylures,2007-03-16 12:55:00,144,I think the Expresso Enema would be good as well.

Gotta stay single , get a pet instead of kids , stay active physically and sexually , have a fun job , AVOID READING NEWS , avoid getting educated , some red wine here n there helps also . Unless there is some unexpected illness that hits you , you'll live as long as your genes let you"
47890,Puckhead,2007-03-16 16:57:00,377, You're on your own there bro...  My daughter has brought so much happiness and laughter into my life that if far outweighs kid stress... I highly recommend rug rats..  Why do you think women live longer than men?  They spend more time with the kids while they're actually kids...
