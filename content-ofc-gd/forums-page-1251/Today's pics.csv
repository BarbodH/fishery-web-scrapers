47654,xrap,2007-03-16 02:09:00,683,"Went out today and didn't really expect too catch anything. trib was blown so we just dropped a worm in the bay see if anything would bite. Nice too see some open water out there, maybe another two more weeks of plus temps and were good to go.   Chocalate water.   Swan   The Bay   Another swan   Racoon, you can't see it too well in this pic "

47852,just2manylures,2007-03-16 15:12:00,144,Some nice shots.  The waterfowl seem to be enjoying the open water
47858,SHAD,2007-03-16 15:19:00,134,"Looks like the bridge at Grindstone and the back end of the harbour looks open!  Won't be long now till the boat launch is ice free, woot woot"

47909,OhioFisherman,2007-03-16 17:34:00,6623,Nice pictures! The ones I have seen of the rivers here on the news look like shots of rapids areas.
48200,magnum,2007-03-17 03:15:00,13,Very Nice Pics....thanks for sharing.......BTW there is a  raccoon that is a pet near there.....not that I would advise it but you can hand feed him........he belongs to the guy with the only house down there......if you go in summer and see him outside the raccoon will be right by his side.......near the dog no less. and yes he roams free.......just some useless info for you.
48201,ccmtcanada,2007-03-17 03:16:00,7971,Nice pics!  I know what you mean about blown tribs...pretty much the same around here.  Let's hope for lots of reports from you and I this time next week after they've had a chance to calm down a little!  Good luck!
48209,xrap,2007-03-17 03:26:00,683,"Racoon for a pet? wow..  There was a bunch of racoons by our car as we were leaving and weren't scared of us at all. I seen the man by the house but i never new he acutally lives thier. And yep lets hope some warm weather next week should bring in some fish and clear up the tribs. Might hit a trib tommrow after work if i got time, I'll post up if I catch anything (don't count on it)"
48210,GbayGiant,2007-03-17 03:29:00,1780," Haha, a famous raccoon, gotta love it.  Nice pics."
