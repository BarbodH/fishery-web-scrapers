47413,mart,2007-03-15 14:37:00,93,"Hey Brian, My partner and I both ordered 2 of the Z's each. We thought that choice was the best style to fit us. My last shirt was that style and I liked the fit. Good luick this year. Are you fishing any of the CFT's?"
47419,mepps,2007-03-15 14:53:00,1301,pro z!
47420,Terry,2007-03-15 14:59:00,14456,"on clothes, I don't like red on ........ but boats..well that's  a whole different story red is the bomb.......... and well your boat...that's the best color.....    you think he will let me back on his boat........lol"
47421,trapshooter,2007-03-15 15:02:00,1234,the pro z looks dark and would likely be warmer from the sun.  PRO X ALL THE WAY BRIAN!!!
47422,steverowbotham,2007-03-15 15:04:00,1800,"Well, it depends how much of a business man you are.  And tournament fishing is about business.  If you feel that you are getting enough from Ku-Man-Chi to display a BIG logo, then the Pro X is a gorgeous shirt, if not, and you feel that another company may deserve that BIG logo, or you want to hold out on a bigger sponsor, then the Pro Tournament would be wise."
47432,bbog,2007-03-15 15:30:00,665,"Pro Z, white is too tough to keep clean!"
47433,misfish,2007-03-15 15:32:00,29133," Hello Mart,welcome to the board. Have we met? I will be fishing the CSFL Western Series as well as a couple 115,s with my oldest son. As of right now,I want to fish the CFT 115 Bog tourny,just waiting for a confirmation from another angler.   Steve I leave the bussiness part back with the sponsor. For someone as myself just starting to get a few years under his belt,I am thankful for what ever I can get from a sponsor.Ko-Man-Chi Baits has selected a few Ontario guys and gals to try and get thier product out in this province.What they offered me in return to me is a very fair deal.Will it lead to more,one never knows. Like I had mentioned long before,I have sponsors that just give to help with the pocket dollars and ask for nothing in return,but I put out from my own pocket a few dollars to pay for some decals I have made up as a token of my appritation,and have them on my boat and truck.  Im not holding out for any big deal. I am in it for the fun and living out a long time dream.Sponsors just make it a little more easier to enjoy.  Terry you know your always welcome in my boat,heck I,ll even give you the bow seat."
47434,Victor,2007-03-15 15:34:00,1609,Personally i like the Pro Tourney one ... black seems too hot to wear under the sun ...
47441,mart,2007-03-15 15:51:00,93,"Hey Brian, No we haven't met. Saw your profile on the Ko-Man-Chi site and just wanted to respond to your post.As a fellow pro-staffer I just wanted to say hello. I'm fishing the CFT 115's so if you make it out to the Bog I fish out of a Crestliner FishHawk. I believe we are boat 5 this year. Hope to see you on the water!!"
47506,misfish,2007-03-15 18:43:00,29133,Well thanks for all the replies all.I went with the X and Z.  Cant wait to see how they look in person.
47522,Flappn,2007-03-15 19:45:00,245,Pro X
47528,fishsmasher,2007-03-15 19:55:00,26,"hey brian i like the mega-city shirt lol there one avalible for you .how you been bud long time no hear ,where you fishing this year"
47550,Puckhead,2007-03-15 21:21:00,377,"What, no pink ones?  I like the pro X the best... hands down."
47560,GbayGiant,2007-03-15 21:40:00,1780,Pro Tournament.
47563,Grimace,2007-03-15 21:56:00,2020,Pro X
47580,tjsa,2007-03-15 22:53:00,1578,"Sheesh, did your MOM lay out your clothes until you were in your teens, or what??  :lol: JUST KIDDING!!  Pro Z,  for when you accidentally badly hook a fish, the red will absorb the blood spatter!! and you can always say it is the pasta sauce from your quick lunch of day old pizza.  Hey, I am a CSI fan,  Yeah, the black will be to hot, and the white too garish, although cooler for the body."
47585,Rich Clemens,2007-03-15 23:03:00,3131,Another vote for the Pro Tournament.
47591,Roy,2007-03-15 23:12:00,13728,"It really is difficult to answer correctly without knowing the colour of your slacks n' socks let alone which ties we have to work with. There's also the question of PFD colour and style. (while wearing the black and white shirt, you MUST wear amber glases.)"
47595,steverowbotham,2007-03-15 23:23:00,1800,"sounds good brian!  good luck with your deal, I hope it works out for you!  See you on the trail this year!"
47596,OhioFisherman,2007-03-15 23:26:00,6623,LOL Brian doing good in the tournies is much more important than who`s gear you are wearing! I am sure you know that! Good luck! I wish you well! Pictures! Reports!
47606,Roy,2007-03-15 23:53:00,13728,"Paul, I'm sure Brian will do his best and do very well this year again. He also has Casting for a Cure (with Dave Mercer) as incentive so I KNOW he'll do well, God love'im."
47619,daisy_girl58,2007-03-16 00:28:00,116,Pro Z the colors will not bleed onto the white....  Lorissa
47761,misfish,2007-03-16 10:26:00,29133," As you can see,Roy knows what he is talking about. The gogles do suit the PFD. Notice the Red/Black combination.LOL (Terry you still have this vid?)     Forsure Steve we will have to hook up. Maybe a pizza after day one at Muskoka.  Thanks again all for the replies and well wish,s,and like Roy mentioned, I will be trying my best once again to take some of your hard earned pennies for thr Dave Mercer Cast For Cure. This time I will be organized   . I apoligize for the screw ups last year."
47882,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-16 16:29:00,4399,No disrespect intended boys and girls but fishing shirts and Nascar shirts are the gaudiest things i have ever seen having said that Misfish your shirts are the exception of course.
47324,misfish,2007-03-15 11:21:00,29133,"      There are other colors,but yellow dosent match the boat. LOL Black would be toooo hot."
47326,crappiesteve,2007-03-15 11:29:00,220,"Brian,the Pro tournament looks good.  Steve"
47327,Roy,2007-03-15 11:29:00,13728,Best for you would be Pro Z. Best for the sponsor would be Pro X. Good baits  by the way.
47328,charlied,2007-03-15 11:31:00,584,is say pro x...or try this one...... http://www.tvstoreonline.com/al002NEW.html ....... LOL
47329,JEREMY,2007-03-15 11:39:00,300,I would go with the pro z
47330,taper,2007-03-15 11:40:00,611,"I agree with Roy, I like the pro Z but your sponsor will say pro X."
47333,misfish,2007-03-15 11:45:00,29133,"Those are my choices Charlied.  I am partial to the Pro X myself also like you said,name stands out."
47336,OhioFisherman,2007-03-15 11:51:00,6623,Pretty in pink? LOL Brian Pro X or Pro T although I really prefer camo.
47337,bpsbassman,2007-03-15 11:51:00,941,What Roy said.
47355,just2manylures,2007-03-15 12:46:00,144,I hope they are paying you to wear that.  They all look good to me
47359,Terry,2007-03-15 12:50:00,14456,X or T I don't like red..so the less red the better
47360,misfish,2007-03-15 12:52:00,29133,"Im recieving 2 shirts so Im thinking the Pro Z for when Im out on the boat,and the Pro X for the wiegh-ins.  J2ML, I am taken care of,thats forsure."
47361,misfish,2007-03-15 12:53:00,29133,"  I,ll remember that next time Terry. You can swim right????????????? LOL"
47369,BabyHerc,2007-03-15 13:25:00,285,I like Pro X
47370,1leggedangler,2007-03-15 13:28:00,364,"I like the white one. Good luck with your season Brian.  Cheers, 1leg"
47374,Smokey,2007-03-15 13:33:00,1278,I like the pro Z.
47392,Joey,2007-03-15 13:53:00,9122,"I like the Pro Z, its Sexy B!!!  Joey"
47393,Garyv,2007-03-15 13:54:00,547,"Pro X lettering will most likely show up better, but if there free I would take tham all....LOL  Your luckier thn me...only people I could get to sponser me was Frederick's of Hollywood....you should see what they want me to wear...."
47402,mdej,2007-03-15 14:09:00,98,I think the ProX would have the same heat issues at an all black.  I like the Pro Tourny good mix. What do your other teammates wear?  Wear something different so you stand out more.
47405,Fishnfiend,2007-03-15 14:12:00,357,Pro X
47406,PatrickGG,2007-03-15 14:16:00,562,"Pro X Looks nice and my second pick would be pro tournament, the Pro Z has to much black on the shoulders and chest area wearing it all day in the sun i think the heat will be aggravating."
47408,easton13th,2007-03-15 14:20:00,371,I would go for the Pro X.....  But if they are willing to go for both.....take both and take your time to decide. Good luck  Easton
47410,Beans,2007-03-15 14:27:00,3339, Sounds good to me Brian...as long as the red doesn't spook the fishes...
47411,bigfish1965,2007-03-15 14:30:00,3382,"Which ever one hides the pizza and beer stains the best, really..."
47412,misfish,2007-03-15 14:32:00,29133," L M A O  How did you know I like to pack cold pizza for my lunch,s ? Seriuosly"
