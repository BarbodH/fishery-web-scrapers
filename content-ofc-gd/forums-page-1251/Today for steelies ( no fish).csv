48378,ryanheritage,2007-03-17 18:09:00,180,So I made it out today for the first time this year on my local trib for a couple of hours... Had one on but I became overly excited and off went my first steelie of the year. I should have prob put some new line on and a lead instead of 6lb all the way.... Conditions were real nice when I got there but then the water got a bit murky when things warmed up... It was great to get out though... I think I have found the solution to the waiting game for may first and open water!!! BTW I ran into a guy from FF.net that brought up Canadain Copper when I spoke about OFC.. Had nothing but good things to say about CC and that he was a bit disapointed that someone would try and knoock him I said it was some 17 teen yr old kid and the guy laughed and said who was it ME.inc? I said yes and the guy just called him a loser then hooked up a nice little steelie..needless to say at that point I was on the move to my next spot!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thanks fer the photo help CC

I'm going to try a bunch of east end tribs next weekend...going to be much milder and they should clear up pretty well by then.  Good luck!  Hey BTW...I grew up in Ajax...lived there from 1974 until 2002....I'm in Whitby now...I know...didn't move too far...haha."
