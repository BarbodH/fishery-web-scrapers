Since she didn't have to do a lot of driving, and her 'ex' grudgingly looked after the maintenance of her car, she's now learning a few things the hard way. Like blowing a tire on #11 between Orillia & Barrie last weekend . . .     she has a phone, but she had little idea of exactly where she was. Thank her lucky stars for a kindly O. P. P. officer who stopped, changed her tire, and escorted her to a place he knew would be able to repair the flat!! But . . . .    she hadn't gotten around to getting SOME kind of emergency road coverage. Somebody told her Crappy Tire has something . . . .     but over the last couple years I've seen their service get some bad press. I usually drive a new vehicle and in over 20 years have not had to use 'Roadside Assistance' programs, so I know little about any of them, except I've rarely heard and bad reports about either I mentioned in my heading. Can anyone help her out on what might be the best service, what she can expect to pay, where does she get an application? She does a lotta travelling between Vaughn / Markham to north of Huntsville . . . .     and drives a 10 year old Grand Prix . . .    that things are starting to go on. We thank you VERY much."

48292,OhioFisherman,2007-03-17 13:29:00,6623,"I don`t know if CAA is like triple a down here, we have it! Ours has a basic plan and a plus plan we have the plus. Different features one was towing distance. LOL my old van broke down at work one day, the pickup coil in the distributor went. I didn`t feel like fixing it at work, they towed it the 28 miles home.  It is worth the money just for the peace of mind."
48293,sonny,2007-03-17 13:29:00,511,"caa gold plan is the only way to go,,,,with the gold plan they will tow you to your own shop  regardless of distance,,,witth the regular plan the will only tow you to the closest repair shop,,,weather open or not"
48297,huey graphite,2007-03-17 13:32:00,362,"I second the CAA recommendation. Been with them since I started driving about 20 years ago. Roadside service is great. Battery boosting, will bring you gas if you run out, will jimmy your locks if you lock your keys in. I would go with the ""plus"" membership as opposed to the regular. They will tow up to 250kms as opposed to 10km with the basic membership.  Check out all they offer on their website. They have ticket discounts for amusement parks, hotel discounts, we booked our honeymoon through their travel agency.  Kudos to you for offering her some guidance."
48300,Photoz,2007-03-17 13:38:00,792,Hm m m m  m   ?? I guess the old Ontario Motor League went the way of the dinosaur . . . .     I just tried to find it on GOOGLE . . .     CAA comes up? But . . . .    it sounds like CAA is the only way to go . . .     and well worth the extra for the better service . . . .   I'll pass the message along. T'anks.
48307,Rob,2007-03-17 13:50:00,467,I have Esso auto club gold. They seem to be pretty good. Had a tow from Newmarket to Orillia no charge!   about $70/year  Rob C
48341,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-17 16:20:00,0,CAA has so much more then what's already been mentioned like CAA dollars. I use my CAA card while gassing up at Sunoco whenever I can and I get enough CAA dollars to reduce my membership in half.
48418,pikehunter,2007-03-17 21:02:00,1659,"If she has a cell phone check with the phone service provider to see if they have a plan. I used to have the plan from Bell Mobility for about $4-$5 a month. Used it one time only and the truck was there pronto. The biggest problem with clubs like the CAA/ AAA is that when you need a truck so does every other member in the group! And waiting times can be atrocious!  I used to work in the towing business in the early 80's, I also did some CAA towing under contract. Our nickname for the auto club was ""The Awful Club""  There are many clubs to choose from. Right now I pay about 4 bucks a month to my insurance company, if I need service I pay and then get reimbursed. Funny thing is, I have never used it...knock on wood!"
