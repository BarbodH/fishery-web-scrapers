47234,tbayboy,2007-03-15 01:11:00,1497,"I went in today to swap a rod I'd picked up on the weekend (wasn't paying attention and got the wrong one).  Also picked up today special - the fish fryer for $30 and a Shimano Sahara (I can't believe I held back on the Stradic) but here's where I think (hope) I've set myself up for a good summer of fishing.  The woman working the service desk was pretty frazzled, someone was trying to put 4 or 5 of the fryers 'on hold' behind her while some other guy was pestering her about where the other person who, I gathered, was suppose to be helping her was and well she just seemed to be having a bad night.  So needless to say she was getting all confused with my exchange + new purchase then as she's typing it all up some other guy walks into my rod so it spins and wacks her in the arm pretty good.  I meekly said thanks and walked out.  As I got to the car it popped into my head - I was billed $50 but the Sahara was $70 and the fryer was $30, whats up? I checked the bill and sure enough she'd taken off the $100 for the old rod but hadn't charged me for its replacement.  Up pops the little devil and angel on the shoulders - Run away screamed the devil and I thought about it for a bit but then I remembered how bad this girls night was going and that probably was enough to make me go back but then the real reason popped into my head: Would you want to fish with a rod holding bad Karma like that?  Hell no so back I went and she seemed quite relieved as I'd also walked out with the store copy of the exchange form by mistake.  I'm now out a hundred bucks but I've got a rod that I'm hoping is full of some good fishing Karma.  Of course if it breaks on the big hookset I'll know to listen to the devil side from now on"
47309,Victor,2007-03-15 04:52:00,1609,Good for ya TbayBoy! Make sure to let us know if the angels do help you out on ur outings  Just came home and realized i actually found the answers to my question in the BPS flyer ... but thanks guys
47316,misfish,2007-03-15 10:08:00,29133,"Roger, are those the Garry Rouch light,n rods? Also, are they coming in 1 piece aswell?  As you may recall,I donated one of them to Lake Erie acouple of years ago."
47338,bpsbassman,2007-03-15 11:55:00,941,Not sure Brian.  Maybe Baby Herc or someone could clarify.
47429,fishersquige,2007-03-15 15:25:00,52,They aren't Garry Rouch's but they come in many different lengths and actions and also one and two piece.
47435,misfish,2007-03-15 15:35:00,29133,Thank you. I was thinking they may not be as they are up there in price.  Thanks for the reply
47443,Hooked,2007-03-15 15:52:00,891,"My guess is they would be the Buzz Ramsey or Hank Parker, same rod, sig series.  They are actually nice rods, have a 7'.  Seen them elsewhere for $30, can't go wrong with the price BPS is offering."
47449,fishersquige,2007-03-15 16:02:00,52,"Come on down on the weekend boys Baby Herc (Chris), BPSBASSMAN (Roger) or me Fishersquige (Luigi) we'll be there."
