47786,pameladallaire,2007-03-16 12:15:00,470,Does anyone know a PDF maker program that is inexpensive or FREE???  I need one for my art club.  Pam
47791,Bly,2007-03-16 12:27:00,1556, I don't know if these are any good but both can be used for free.  The second has an advertisment banner unless you purchase it but I think it is only 19.95 for the suite.  cutepdf  Pdf995  bly
47806,mepps,2007-03-16 13:04:00,1301,"Havent used any myself, but if you google PDF maker there are several free options that appear.  Download .com is another good place to try...  http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?t...dumb ass&tag=srch"
47810,bigfish1965,2007-03-16 13:11:00,3382,"There are very few good PDF makers that are free. The best solution I found was to make oneon the Adobe site. http://createpdf.adobe.com/ They have a free service there. For a PDF reader, the best system going is Foxit PDF reader. I absolutely hated Adobe Reader because of its massive resource use and tendency to snarl up any browser made. Download Foxit here. http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php There is also a nice extension for Firefox users call PDF Download which allows you to save or view PDF files in either PDF or HTML. Super easy to use and install. http://www.pdfdownload.org/"

47839,tbayboy,2007-03-16 14:37:00,1497,"Here's a couple options:  1) Google docs: docs.google.com - has a save as PDF for docs and spreadsheets (among other features) 2) OpenOffice: All of the apps (shreadsheets, presentations, word files, etc) can be exported to PDF: www.openoffice.org"
47910,mdej,2007-03-16 17:37:00,98,I second Foxit PDF its a great tool set.  TBayBoy has a good point as well.... same one my office mate responds with when asked about writing a PDF by our clients.
47955,pameladallaire,2007-03-16 18:56:00,470,Thank you guys...some of the downloads were free trials so I installed Open Office for free and now I have a power point presentation creator that I can save as pdf files.  I also have the other office programs that didn't come with my home computer.  I'm all excited.  Pam
