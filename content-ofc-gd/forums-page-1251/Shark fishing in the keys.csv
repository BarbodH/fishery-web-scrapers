48195,Dondorfish,2007-03-17 02:55:00,1000,Just got emailed pictures of my buddies trip to the keys. Managed to get out on his dad's boat for a day of fishing - hope the pictures come through!   Don               Nice little nurse shark - and I think the smile tells it all:     
48246,taper,2007-03-17 07:53:00,611,Looks like a good time. Are all sharks caught kept or can they be landed and released. Just curious.
48252,Greencoachdog,2007-03-17 11:41:00,8163,"  Most sharks aren't even landed, the larger ones can be very dangerous to bring onboard. Small Sharks can be landed and released without any problem."
