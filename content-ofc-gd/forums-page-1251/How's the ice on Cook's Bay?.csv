47683,Fishnfiend,2007-03-16 03:05:00,357,"I want to take my father (#1 fishing partner and the person responsible for my addiction) fishing for some Jumbos on Saturday morning off the end of '89.  He just recently retired and moved to the cottage with my mom.  I figure he could use some quality 'guy time' and want to take him out.  However, I want to ensure that it is still safe... Can anyone tell me how thick the ice is?  Do I leave my truck on shore and walk?    I know that Cook's is full of 'dinks' this year, but I really just want to take hime out.  Even if we don't end up with too many keepers.  I had my tuck on the ice last weekend and know that there was plenty of ice...  Any help/information is greatly appreciated."

I fished alone and didn't even have time drill a second hole for the first 1.5 hours of my day.  I just wish that I had got there before 8:30.  The fishing died off at lunch so I left.  My friend ""Mr Augermesiter""  and his faithful companion joined me on Sunday:    The fishing was veeeeeerrrry sloooooooow until the nite bite, but we got to hang out and catch some rays, throw the ball for the dog and enjoy a cold one in the warm sun.  Augermeister's dog (Gar Bageater) is very obedient.  When told to 'go fish', this is what he did:    Hopefully, you tell me that the ice is still good and I can post an nice report early next week."

48008,misfish,2007-03-16 20:02:00,29133,"Lake Simcoe ice unsafe: Police Friday, March 16, 2007 - 01:12 PM By: Anne Winstanley   Toronto - A warning from York Regional Police about the ice on Lake Simcoe .. stay off it.  The recent warm temperatures have caused the ice to deteriorate, leaving areas of open water along the shoreline.  Police say a vehicle that was attempting to cross the lake this morning near Virginia Beach just north of Pefferlaw, plunged through the ice. The driver was not injured and was able to get out safely.  All ice fishing huts were to be removed from the lake by midnight last night.  York Regional Police is urging residents to follow these safety tips:  - Wear proper flotation attire and clothing when participating in a water-related activity - Tell someone about your plans and specifically where you are going - Know the condition of the ice or water before you go out and take into consideration the recent changes in the weather may have had on the ice - Be suspicious of gray, dark or porous spots in the ice as these may be soft areas. Ice is generally strongest where it is hard and blue.  For more information, please contact the Marine Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7320, or visit www.yrp.ca."
