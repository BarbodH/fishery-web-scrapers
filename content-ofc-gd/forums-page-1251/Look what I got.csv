Nobody will ever play with me though  I used to play with my brother and parents and they would accuse me of cheating saying that I knew where the biggest fish placeholders were ( I would place all those little cardboard pieces), so they would just follow my boat around and fish where I was fishing  Bob actually has hair! Good times! Tony"
