48009,misfish,2007-03-16 20:04:00,29133,"Lake Simcoe ice unsafe: Police Friday, March 16, 2007 - 01:12 PM By: Anne Winstanley   Toronto - A warning from York Regional Police about the ice on Lake Simcoe .. stay off it.  The recent warm temperatures have caused the ice to deteriorate, leaving areas of open water along the shoreline.  Police say a vehicle that was attempting to cross the lake this morning near Virginia Beach just north of Pefferlaw, plunged through the ice. The driver was not injured and was able to get out safely.  All ice fishing huts were to be removed from the lake by midnight last night.  York Regional Police is urging residents to follow these safety tips:  - Wear proper flotation attire and clothing when participating in a water-related activity - Tell someone about your plans and specifically where you are going - Know the condition of the ice or water before you go out and take into consideration the recent changes in the weather may have had on the ice - Be suspicious of gray, dark or porous spots in the ice as these may be soft areas. Ice is generally strongest where it is hard and blue.  For more information, please contact the Marine Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7320, or visit www.yrp.ca."
