48137,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 00:49:00,2984,"Setting up my boat for trolling and I would like to pick up some extra rods. I'm not looking for recommendations, I know what I would buy if money wasn't an issue - just looking for opinions on these Heartland rods.  Looking for 2 downrigging rods 8'-9' for salmon Also looking for 2 dipsy rods 9'-10' forbows and salmon.  These rods are really cheap at $30, are they a good value or a waste of money?  -Brian"
48187,jigger08,2007-03-17 02:40:00,38,"Hey Brian I have a pair of these in my stash and they are well worth the money.They handle downrigging,straight line and inline planer boards with ease and are more than adequate for salmon and trout.Better balance than my slightly more expensive Eagle Claws."
48212,canadian_copper,2007-03-17 03:33:00,925,i dont have a boat but i do sell alot of those rods at the show!!! i got to use them last yr in my bud boat and i liked the way they handled very well!!!
48294,Fishmaster,2007-03-17 13:30:00,920,Used them on my charters for years good rods ...
48298,OhioFisherman,2007-03-17 13:33:00,6623,"I don`t have any of the trolling rods, but some baitcasting and spinning. Decent rods, no problems with them."
48436,silveradosheriff,2007-03-17 21:31:00,1025,"Been using two dipsy rods - so far, so good!"
48444,bassdreamer,2007-03-17 21:49:00,128,me and walleyedreamer been using these rods on quinte in the fall for the last five years with no problems.they pull the in-line boards and the big lures with ease.
48448,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 21:55:00,2984,Sounds like these rods are a great buy (for the money). I've read elsewhere that the guides stand up well for wire too. Thanks for the input folks! -Brian
