741719,dave524,2012-11-02 19:04:00,4508," My rule of thumb is just the opposite, the later and colder it gets the more roe I use, hardware is better when it is early and warmer."

741728,solopaddler,2012-11-02 19:23:00,8605,"Yep, now is prime time. When the water gets colder they won't chase a lure quite as much."
741738,asdve23rveavwa,2012-11-02 19:57:00,2690,"Never too early for hardware.  Like the others have said, they chase less as it gets colder.  I've caught them at rivermouths on spoons pretty much right up until December."
741743,Snidley,2012-11-02 20:13:00,620,"Once they get used to the cold they will resume hitting lures of all sorts. The vast majority of the winter steelhead I catch are on cranks, spinners and spoons. Come to think of it they like jigs hopped across the bottom too. Some of those guys are Lakers though. Right now trolling will be a big part of keeping the bite on all day. Or you could give up and go to bait."
741745,Bill Shearer,2012-11-02 20:27:00,456,Kwifish and spinners in the deep slow pools anytime! Osuch a rush when they hit!
741820,ironstone74,2012-11-03 00:24:00,201,I got schooled by some old timers tossing hardware on Monday. I got 3 on beads and roe and they each landed twice as many as I!
