741261,mike rousseau,2012-11-01 00:59:00,4661,So I kept my boy home from daycare today to have a guys day... This included a trip to NY state to pick up some fishing gear...  On the way over the fella working the toll booth had brought in Halloween chips to give to kids crossing the bridge....  I just thought it was really nice... No matter how it was funded....  Little things like that can make a kids day and you don't see those gestures very often....  Needless to say my little fella loved the mini Doritos...  Thanks toll booth guy

741354,mike rousseau,2012-11-01 14:49:00,4661,This was the toll booth... Not customs....  And they were also nice... $120 in gear... No tax...
