740808,mike rousseau,2012-10-30 17:25:00,4661,The other day a woman I work with said she had something for me.... Ended up being an old FULL kids tackle box...  Everything in it was pretty old... But the coolest item was this  Original heddon wood vamp   
740818,ecmilley,2012-10-30 17:47:00,2163,nice little treasure
740821,Headhunter,2012-10-30 17:56:00,5703,"I have one just like that, well, not quite like that as mine has the finish coming off of it! Caught some nice smallies on that lure... HH"
740822,mike rousseau,2012-10-30 17:57:00,4661,Any ideas when they stopped producing these baits...?
740826,Headhunter,2012-10-30 18:08:00,5703,"Maybe because they were having problems with the finish splitting off of the bait?! I know I bought mine new and only used it a few times, only to find that the body was soaking up water and splitting the finish off of it. Just a guess mind you... HH"
740836,Skipper D,2012-10-30 18:43:00,1970,  Do you still have yours ...... lol

740849,jimmer,2012-10-30 19:27:00,2730,"That was my favourite lure as a kid, then they started making them in a plastic model."
740860,mercman,2012-10-30 19:57:00,7054,Awesome find Mike !!! Pops used those lures for Pike and Walleye when i was a kid.

740945,Skipper D,2012-10-31 00:03:00,1970,"I love looking at this old stuff , very nice to see it ..............."
740968,kickingfrog,2012-10-31 00:57:00,8333,I used a perch river runt (looks like a smaller version of the vamp) a lot as a kid. Lots of Nipissing smallmouth could not resist it.
740984,UglyBug,2012-10-31 01:26:00,148,Was produced from 1966 thru 1983
741038,mike rousseau,2012-10-31 06:09:00,4661,  And this box will be my sons first after I clean it up...
741042,OhioFisherman,2012-10-31 11:02:00,6623,"Pretty sure than was called a Strawberry vamp, and it was one of our go to lures at Point Au Baril in the 60`s and 70`s. At one point back then I had a half a dozen of them, pike would play hell with the finish.  As I recall all of mine were purchased in the Parry Sound - Pointe Au Baril area, they weren`t a lure that was regularly seen or used in this area, perhaps due to a pike shortage in my area."
741044,Rich,2012-10-31 11:15:00,3927,Pfleuger Supreme is worth serious $$$$
741247,mercman,2012-11-01 00:24:00,7054," Not really sure, but i dont think so"
