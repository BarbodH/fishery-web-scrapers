740794,mike rousseau,2012-10-30 16:17:00,4661,Don't know how many of you remember that weird video posted with the sheep head fishing and gotye music in the background.... And jigs in some other guys face....  Well that guy landed himself a tv show starting next year....  Uncut angling on wild tv.... And pursuit channel....  If its anything like his YouTube videos it will be exciting multi species action with plenty of big fish...  Way to go Aaron....  Can't wait...
740796,Christopheraaron,2012-10-30 16:32:00,3525,"Alright Aaron! Love his videos, lots of information, and lots of big fish! are they going to have it on WFN?"
740802,206,2012-10-30 17:05:00,563,"nice, congrats guys  uncut angling.com"
740823,craigdritchie,2012-10-30 18:02:00,1586,"That's excellent news. I just love these guys - they're truly fearless, and about the only ones out there doing anything creative or different. I look forward to seeing their show, since the vast majority of TV fishing shows on air now are just plain awful."
740844,Fishing4Tails,2012-10-30 18:56:00,38,I've had the honor Fishing against Aaron in competitions and Fishing for fun with him .. He just an amazing angler that lives and breaths fishing .. Congrat to Aaron and his crew !!  As richie said above ... The other show are getting boring !!
741029,Skud,2012-10-31 03:54:00,739,Fun guys to watch. Looking forward to seeing the show.
741064,SmokestackLightnin,2012-10-31 13:07:00,390, Well said
741102,lhousesoccer,2012-10-31 15:17:00,442,"I had never heard of them so I checked out their website and watch a couple videos.  I've never seen anything like it.  The sheepshead video .... I'm speechless.  I don't know what to say, other than I couldn't stop watching.  It was the most odd, amazing, mesmerizing, entertaining fishing video I've seen, possibly ever.  These guys are gonna do alright! "
741116,Toad Hunter,2012-10-31 16:29:00,261,"always look forward to knew fishing shows, but if its anything like that Gotye video I hope he either starts to wear sun screen or spray on tan .. watched a few of the other videos... looks good"
741152,Terry,2012-10-31 19:09:00,14456,"if it's the video I am thinking of, it seemed gay... (not that there is anything wrong with that)  but it's not for me...wasn't he singing to the other guy in the boat and being about as manly as Richard Simmons    (not that there is anything wrong with that) but it's not for me."
741162,Twocoda,2012-10-31 19:57:00,4130,That video was designed to draw attention...I think it was a successful decision...not all of the videos are Richard Simmonsy...I think they will be good to watch up until they get on the sponsor ship wagon
741177,TJQ,2012-10-31 20:37:00,7806,Good for those guys... i though the vid was pretty funny... not that there's anything wrong with that.
741199,misfish,2012-10-31 21:08:00,29133,"Ever since I watched that vid,everytime I hear that song,I think of them. Not that thats wrong."
741295,troutologist,2012-11-01 03:10:00,951,This will be awesome. That crew goes full time and catches some amazing fish. Not to mention puts a different twist on catching them. Keep your eyes out for this show!
741324,Rod Caster,2012-11-01 12:29:00,5784,"They definitely seem eccentric....hooks in the face, eating worms hahaha. Good entertainment for sure. Bring it on."
741333,craigdritchie,2012-11-01 12:55:00,1586,"Here's a hoot - go to Wikipedia and search ""Somebody That I Used To Know""  Or just click here   :-)  Scroll down to the section titled ""Cover versions and media appearances"" ..... and read the last paragraph.  These guys are going places, I tell you!  LMAO!!"
741337,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 13:01:00,3525, Cool!
