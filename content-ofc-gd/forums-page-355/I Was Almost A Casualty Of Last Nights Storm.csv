741080,BillM,2012-10-31 14:17:00,17367," Nah, he lines them up and hopes they move.... They never do, lol!"
740967,solopaddler,2012-10-31 00:56:00,8605,"I thought I'd share this with you guys, it's pretty bizarre.  I was on my way home from work this morning at 6am, winds were gusting like crazy and trees were downed everywhere.  I was about 2km's from home driving on a heavily wooded sideroad, all the while being buffeted by the heavy winds.  As I was driving underneath a dense canopy from a huge overhanging oak tree a huge gust hit and a squirrel landed right on my windshield.  I almost ended up in the ditch. It was easily one of the more startling things that's happened to me in a while LOL!"
740969,Christopheraaron,2012-10-31 00:59:00,3525,Glad you're ok Mike! But how was the squirrel?
740971,kickingfrog,2012-10-31 01:02:00,8333, Delicious with a little breading and melted butter.
740972,Rod Caster,2012-10-31 01:06:00,5784,"Good thing your ok, but really, I feel worse for the squirrel haha."
740973,Christopheraaron,2012-10-31 01:07:00,3525, Ever had one? They look kind of tasty.
740974,Joey,2012-10-31 01:10:00,9122,"Terrifying  I just ran into a coyote on my street while walking Ralphie.  Was trotting down the sidewalk.  I was paying absolutely no attention whatsoever, and was looking at houses and checking out their cool halloween decorations.  Ralphie tugged at the leash to go see the ""dog"" and as I looked, realized it was a coyote.  I yanked Ralphie's leash and pulled him to me.  The coyote was about 5 feet away, 70 lbs and very tall.  Looked at Ralphie, then at me, then at Ralphie again, then trotted off.  First time on my street.  Guess I'll have to keep an eye out from now on."
740975,Fisherman,2012-10-31 01:10:00,7201," Damm right they are, especially the ones that dingbat across the road used to feed 50lb bags of peanuts to."
740978,mercman,2012-10-31 01:15:00,7054," Sorry Mike, but after reading your fishing stories and excellent adventures, i was not ready for the Squirel.I almost swallowed my tongue i laffed so hard."
740981,solopaddler,2012-10-31 01:21:00,8605, Beat me to it.    At least it wasn't blown out of a tree by a huge wind gust right onto Ralphie. That would have been much worse.    It was like a scene out of a John Candy movie.
740982,Twocoda,2012-10-31 01:24:00,4130,windy ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=E0okh6dxfgs  edit to add ..those are 50 foot cliffs
740983,Christopheraaron,2012-10-31 01:25:00,3525, Sure you're in richmond hill. we're surrounded by a gated community.
740985,Grimace,2012-10-31 01:31:00,2020,I vaguely remember a funny story you told where there was some sort of crazed chipmunk or something.  Big bears don't seem to have a problem with you but all sorts of little critters are trying to do you in.
740986,SirCranksalot,2012-10-31 01:32:00,3291,"I've heard of it raining cats and dogs, but that's a new twist!"
740988,I'mHooked,2012-10-31 01:39:00,525,"Meanwhile, back at the nest...""Honey, you've got to hear this! So I was climbing through the big Oak tree down the street, minding my business, when all of a sudden I feel like Dorothy and am flying through the air! Wee this is cool, I always wondered what it was like to be a bird, when all of a sudden WHAMO! My nutsack is flat against some guys windshield and he's getting an eyeful of my junk against the glass. Well I'll tell you, this guy looked so impressed he had a hard time keeping his car on the road. Almost sent me flying into the ditch! Needless to say I think he's got a new appreciation for our kind. Should of seen his expression when I flipped him the bird and dove for cover! Anyhow, that's why I'm late dear. How was shopping at the old Maple tree?"" "
740989,kemper,2012-10-31 01:40:00,2232,"Don't get anywhere near Mike's truck, it's a axe-wielding murderer.  Last time I went fishing with him I think we annihilated an entire family of raccoons."
740990,i2cool2fool,2012-10-31 01:41:00,349,Glad it was only a squirrel and not the tree on your windshield!

740993,solopaddler,2012-10-31 01:48:00,8605," Was going to mention that, but I didn't think anyone would remember or get the connection.  Here it is  :  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8695&st=0&p=88741&hl=squirrel&fromsearch=1entry88547    HAHA!    Damn straight."
