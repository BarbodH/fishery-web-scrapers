741987,Terry,2012-11-04 01:19:00,14456,"Queensland could be his home but of course he drinks beer, doesn't everyone "

741883,woodenboater,2012-11-03 13:49:00,2277,"checking IP's this morning Roy ?  Is he working or vacationing down there ?  Australians are great people, very much like Canadians, but with accents. They love their beer with some backbone as well lol."
741901,Rich Clemens,2012-11-03 15:02:00,3131,"  That would be cool to see some fish from the ""Land Down Under"" I watched a couple of ""RIVER MONSTER"" shows that were taped down there."
741912,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 15:58:00,3525," I find the aussie fishing championships interesting, especially the barramundi!"
741915,woodenboater,2012-11-03 16:19:00,2277,which taste...nom nom nom
741921,John,2012-11-03 17:53:00,2956,That's really cool Roy

741930,Roy,2012-11-03 18:53:00,13728,"Yes, he's my youngest brudder. Moved his business there (Brisbane) more than 10 years ago."
741932,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 18:55:00,3525, Tell him to sign up!
741935,misfish,2012-11-03 19:02:00,29133," You ask,not tell. Wheres your manners."
741936,Roy,2012-11-03 19:05:00,13728,"Christopher, Christopher, Christopher, you can't tell my kin anything....you have to suggest and wait for it to sink in."
741937,Roy,2012-11-03 19:05:00,13728,See? Me udder brudder knows dat too!
741939,DoubleDigits,2012-11-03 19:12:00,140,"Here are some pics i dug up of some fishing my brother and I did in SE Queensland (near Brisbane) a few years ago. First is a vid of memorable catch, my only attempt at freshwater while i was there netted me this nice little Aussie Bass:   Here are some other saltwater pics: My buddy Damon with a shovelnosed shark  And the baby version:  A man-sized Bull Shark...this one didn't come in the boat...  My fave Aussie fish, the Snapper (Pagrus Aurata). Looks, fight, eating...has it all  Called Squire or Pinkys as juveniles,   This is a Longtail Tuna, an inshore species that come into the bay for a short season and can be chased and sight fished with fly or lures. This one took bait.  One of the best eating fish in the sea, a Spangled Emperor:  Another tasty one, Goldspotted pigfish:    This is a Spotted Wobbegong, one of the many local shark species:    Great place to fish... "
741940,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 19:15:00,3525,that spotted wobbegong is cool!
741941,DoubleDigits,2012-11-03 19:18:00,140,  It was trying to bite me the whole time lol
741942,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 19:18:00,3525,I like the shovelhead too...
741952,kickingfrog,2012-11-03 20:18:00,8333,I'd love to see more photos of those fish anytime you get a chance.
741956,Christopheraaron,2012-11-03 20:27:00,3525,"He did miss the flats fish, permit, bones..."
741960,DoubleDigits,2012-11-03 20:40:00,140, There isn't much pure flats fishing in that part of Aus...but I did used to wade a nearby flat for a tasty but ugly fish called dusky flathead.
741961,DoubleDigits,2012-11-03 20:43:00,140," Thanks. I will dig up the old lap top and see what I can find. I didn't take nearly enough pictures. I caught and released many creatures that I would never see again, without a camera around...thought I was going to be fishing there forever..."
741962,misfish,2012-11-03 20:46:00,29133,  AWESOME STUFF THERE. I too look forward to more.
741967,DoubleDigits,2012-11-03 21:10:00,140,"This is pretty snapper caught by my bro. This is a good fish for inshore.    This toothy critter is called a Yellowtail Pike:   Here is a nice snapper, and a Painted Sweetlip, or Slatey Bream, (depends who you ask). Never kept another one of those...gross!   Another 'error' in the trial and error of discovering which ones taste good...this fork tailed catfish. Caught at 110 fow well offshore. It was brilliant silver when alive.   Orange-lined Triggerfish:   A couple of Giant Trevally, or GTs:  "
