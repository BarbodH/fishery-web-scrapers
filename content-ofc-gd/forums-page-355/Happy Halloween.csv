741085,Roy,2012-10-31 14:33:00,13728,"Of course he'll like the pumpkin, it's a source of heat and light to him. Kinda like a portable fireplace eh?  I guess tonight's the only night in the year that I can call to ask what you're wearing eh?"

741088,Roy,2012-10-31 14:38:00,13728,"Are those the entry or exit points, Wayne?"
741089,irishfield,2012-10-31 14:39:00,26272,Entry... as for exit.. we were using hollow points. No need to scoop goo or seeds out of these ones!!

741092,irishfield,2012-10-31 14:49:00,26272," Yah.. you don't wanna mess with my gals!!    Either of them.. I could say take another 1/4"" off the left side of that nose hole and bang.. it was gone. Great way to vent some frustation.. killing something that was already dead!  Joey.. where's the pumpking Paul carved??"
741096,Joey,2012-10-31 14:54:00,9122,"Sure looks like a blast wayne (no pun intended   )   We had to throw Paul's away, it scared the neighbours too much"

741108,jimmer,2012-10-31 15:30:00,2730,Something about Halloween that brings the worst out in me. Happy Halloween to all the kiddies or adults that just love sweets!
741113,misfish,2012-10-31 15:39:00,29133,Nice traditional carving J.
741117,Fish4Eyes,2012-10-31 16:40:00,1022," Waiting for the punks who cause trouble on ""Devil's night""?   I warned my girlfriend not to leave the pumpkins on the porch. The next day I found them smashed on the trunk of my car. I laughed it off and remembered my younger days when I used to cause havoc. I seem to have an incident every year up to and including getting egged while driving and having my window open just enough to get egg on my face"
