I pulled it loose and began dragging it in. Within 10 yards of me my line was up in the air with a Gar pike at the hook end. Perhaps he was he was at the wrong place at the wrong time having the line tangle up in his snout, or he went for it Has anyone ever had a gar pike hit a roe bag before?"

740991,kemper,2012-10-31 01:42:00,2232,"Never a gar pike...  Bass, Northern Pike, Carp, and hulk sized creek chub have all had a snack on my roe bags at one point or another though"

741055,Rich,2012-10-31 12:14:00,3927,"What the heck is a gar doing in frigid steelhead water? And feeding? Very weird. Gar like very, very warm water."
