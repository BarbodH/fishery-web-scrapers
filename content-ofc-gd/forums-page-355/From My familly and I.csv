The wake and funeral are over, and Mom and Dad have been reunited. I reconnected with familly i haven't seen in years, and we all celibrated her life, the way she would have wanted us too, with love and fond memories. As i sat there and listened at the church, as her pastor talked about her love of life, and her love for friends and familly, a gentle breeze touched my face, and for an instant, i smelled her perfume.No one else noticed, but i did, and thats all that counts.  Thanks from my familly to you and yours.   Paul"
