741591,chris.brock,2012-11-02 02:51:00,4053,"another great trip, lots of pike, not huge, but tons between 8 and 14 lbs, we found a spot we called ""craddle bay"" because of all the times we had to craddle pike, seemed like an evening walleye bite, one evening while solo, I caught 30 fish in less than 2 hours, mostly walleye, steady action, we also discovered a 10 km, straight lake, isn't enough water to keep us amused for a week, some jumbo perch too (no pics though)  loading up, dropped the canoe off at Mattice for a future canoe trip (that's another story though, a good one too)    spent the night at Owen's, Dad and Cousin enjoying the sunrise, a possible, drunken bear sighting exactly in the direction they're facing, the night before    the outfitter wasn't impressed with the tower of beer, because lots of beer = prop damage, cabins burning down, general destructiveness, etc, they spoke in French for awhile, then we boarded the plane (some type of cool, extended, turbo beaver (Irishfield?)) and we where off    wow, even a Curado can get bugged up if you're careless, yeah, I know friends don't let friends use mono, but braid would have been alot worse    then the pike came    not huge, but decent and plenty, and shallow, and fiesty    lots of solid pike    bit of a beer belly on this gal    craddle bay again, these are just my pics, the other guys did as well too    no need to portage, ramming speed, no damage done, it's alot easier when it's not your outboard, this was the trip where my cousin coined the phrase, WGFUBWDFYSU, ""we get _ up but we don't _ your _ up""  "

741597,chris.brock,2012-11-02 03:18:00,4053,"cool, glad you like them, they're not quite comparable to a solopaddler report, I'll likely do a few more tomorrow, killing time"
741629,Rod Caster,2012-11-02 12:32:00,5784,Good to see these up. Awesome trip. That's a lot of beer haha

741876,Joey,2012-11-03 13:04:00,9122,"Really enjoying these reports Chris, keep em coming"
741903,Rich Clemens,2012-11-03 15:04:00,3131,Love the pike shots.  Question:  Did you require a separate boat just for your beverages - or did you make a couple trips.
