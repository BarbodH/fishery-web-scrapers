741920,Burtess,2012-11-03 17:40:00,901,Picked up a jar of Gulp Pink Earthworms.... wondering if anyone has used them for steelhead and their effectiveness vs. the Powebait worms?  Burt
741925,Rich,2012-11-03 18:14:00,3927,I never got anything on the power bait ones.. got 2 on the gulps this year though
741927,bare foot wader,2012-11-03 18:30:00,1354,"the gulp worms in the jar are always in my steelead pack, you can get 2 different sizes, skinny guys and the fatter ones...I use these equally as much as I use roe, esp the natural colour in gin clear water  best there is IMO"
741928,misfish,2012-11-03 18:36:00,29133," I,ll have to give them a try. I have had great success with the power ones. Pink and orange. Natural worm in the spring,"
741929,bare foot wader,2012-11-03 18:40:00,1354,the skinny ones are labelled earthworms and the larger ones are labelled nightcrawlers  http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/soft-bait/gulp
