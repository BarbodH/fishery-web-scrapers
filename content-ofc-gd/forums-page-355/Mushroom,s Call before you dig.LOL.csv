741225,misfish,2012-10-31 22:33:00,29133,Out for a walk with Gizmo and came across a great crop of shrooms under a bunch of pine trees.  Eatable or not?      
741229,Joeytier,2012-10-31 23:13:00,3990,Did you just pick one at random without any baseline knowledge of edible mushrooms?  You are one brave man...
741235,camillj,2012-10-31 23:41:00,1988,Careful bud .. some are dangerous even to the touch

741242,ehg,2012-11-01 00:07:00,2666,"Don't eat it. It is some type of russula mushroom. Not deadly but not edible. Did a lot of mushroom foraging back in the day, very few were edible. Anything with white gills is almost deadly.  Did find chantrelles and other good ones, lots of times they would have tons of bugs though. Here is a list of good ones. You have to be careful. http://northernbushcraft.com/guide.php?ctgy=edible_mushrooms&region=ontario"
