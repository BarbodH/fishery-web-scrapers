741140,BillM,2012-10-31 18:31:00,17367," There have already been no kill sections implemented in certain rivers that have proven to help the fishery..   I'm just failing to see how having more CO's there to enforce those rules will have a direct impact on the fishery.  Like you've said yourself, most people obey the law, even with a million CO's patrolling Ontario there will still be those few that don't.   Does that mean we shouldn't implement things like no kill because it's doomed to fail?"
741143,Gregoire,2012-10-31 18:50:00,1397," I Think that no kill zones in specific areas are a good idea in some situations. I doubt that imlementing a no kill zone in the GTA would be succesfull unless the policy was heavily enforced. I think that honest aglers would see dishonest anglers taking fish and not facing any consequences and some would choose to do the same, and may be tempted to disreguard regulations. I definitely would argue that there is not point in implementing things that are doomed to fail. Just think: How many people would buy a fishing licence if they knew that they would never be checked for one."
741144,kemper,2012-10-31 18:53:00,2232," I've been checked for a license one time...ONCE!  I spend probably 65-85 days on the water each year, during spring and fall up to 4 time/week and often in popular spots.

741145,BillM,2012-10-31 18:57:00,17367," How many times do you get checked now?  Do you still buy a license?  I don't think you can implement an entire species as No kill, but little steps at a time... it does work."

741236,ch312,2012-10-31 23:47:00,1590,"  this past sunday in caledonia the CO made a special stop to check me and one other guy who had to wade about 75-100 yards to show his license. i had the pleasure of showing it again the next day too. i fished the grand for a good 15 years without seeing a single CO on the river and then i got checked two days in a row. weird coincidence i guess?   it would be nice if there was a way to have appointed volunteer CO's after having went through minimal training. they could hand out fines for simple thing's like being over the limit, no license, littering, etc and strictly enforce those rules only leaving trained officers to deal with more complicated or dangerous issues. it would cost next to nothing to operate, generate huge revenue for the fish, clean up the trash (garbage and poachers), and improve our fisheries.  but, i assume that would never happen?"
741238,Twocoda,2012-10-31 23:52:00,4130, you dont have to be able to write a ticket to say something or carry a garbage bag...just saying education doesnt always have to have a punishment attached to it...

741374,ch312,2012-11-01 16:20:00,1590," my post said ""appointed volunteers that have went through minimal training"" meaning volunteers wishing to take part would need to take some training on how to deal with people and enforce the few rules i mentioned. they would target those 3 specific violations and would hand out tickets only for those simple thing's that can't really be disputed. i wasn't suggesting that every john, joe and harry would be able to hand out tickets, only a select few for each water body that are hand picked by the MNR.  lowering the number of people fishing over the limit, no license and fishing in sanctuary/closed areas would be very beneficial to our fisheries and are simple black and white regulations that could be enforced by someone with minimal training.   but, like i said, i assume it would never happen."
741375,Musky or Specks,2012-11-01 16:23:00,2710,"This was tried on the no kill stretch of the Grand. It didn't work because they had no power all they could do was phone for a CO and take notes. We already have that program its called tips. People break the law on the No Kill stretches of The Grand, Credit, Whiteman's and the Notty yet all these sections of river are healthier and producing more CPU then the equivalent non regulated rivers. If what you want is better catching opportunities No kill and strict slots are the proven solution."
741376,ch312,2012-11-01 16:33:00,1590," the majority of people breaking the rules know what they're doing and simply play stupid when confronted. you're suppose to know the rules before you play and this is something we all learn when we're kids.  a speeder that claims to not now the speed limit shouldn't get a ticket if he didn't see the sign? a hunter shooting a deer with a gun in a bow only area is ok if he didn't read the regs? if i kept that sturgeon i caught it would be ok as long as i claimed i didn't know they're protected?   sorry, but i believe adults should be held accountable for their actions. it's not like fishing regulations are something new"
741377,ch312,2012-11-01 16:37:00,1590," no, what i'm suggesting was not tried on the grand as those volunteers couldn't hand out tickets. having people on the water that can't enforce anything and the tips line = complete waste of time, we all know this.   thing's would be much different if people were being handed $125 tickets rather than warnings from angry anglers. lack of enforcement is the #1 reason we all see so many laws broken."

741453,ecmilley,2012-11-01 21:14:00,2163,or of course a mess of these.
740841,BillM,2012-10-30 18:54:00,17367, What exactly are you insinuating?
740848,kemper,2012-10-30 19:13:00,2232,  I hope you aren't implying that I gut and chuck salmon?   My thoughts as well...
740864,chris.brock,2012-10-30 20:01:00,4053,"the Kawartha's receive a constant, high fishing pressure. They're shallow, productive lakes that sustain the pressure better than other lakes. But compare the Kawartha's for example, with a fly-in or portage lake, and you can really notice the difference. Fishing pressure makes alot of difference on the Kawartha's, the Bog, Rice or Simcoe. There is likely other population cycles working too, but the harvest pressure is definately significant."
740884,kemper,2012-10-30 20:53:00,2232," I've been fishing Upper Buckhorn since I was a kid with my old man - no doubt the numbers and size are down over the past ~15 or so years. Every once in a while there is a bumper crop of one species or the other, but it doesn't seem to be consistent."
740906,Stoty,2012-10-30 22:04:00,2910,"Personally, I think slot limits are the way to go. IMO, all lakes should have slot limits on the most popular ""catch and keep"" species. Nothing hurts a fishery more than over-harvesting of the main ""brood"" stock fish.  The slot that the Kawartha's have for Walleye is perfect, IMO. Perfect eating size fish are legally allowed to be kept, whereas the really young and the good ""brood"" stock fish are to be released. To me, THAT is the perfect balance between Anglers and the treehuggers.  From multiple personal experiences while guiding on Quinte, I sure wish they would put a slot limit in there instead of the current limit (4 fish with one over 24""). I think a 14-20"" would be a great slot to have there and the limit should be ZERO on fish over 24"". Especially with the netting and such that goes on. (I have native status, btw... not pointing fingers at anyone)."
740913,BillM,2012-10-30 22:21:00,17367,Slots work great.. A combination of all of these surely would make for a healthier fishery.
740914,northernpike56,2012-10-30 22:29:00,717,  what if you don't need your fishing license yet?  I just always carry my drivers license in my pocket for ID
740923,Steve,2012-10-30 22:54:00,2075,"Stoty, you cannot have it ""zero"" fish over 24"".  you HAVE to provide right to allow an angler to keep his trophy fish.  now, like GB did with muskie, a trophy fish has to be viewed as a true trophy...no 50"" muskie there, no 14lbs walleye on quinte.  but like someone catching a 56"" muskie on GB has the right to harvest it, someone should have right to harvest a 15lbs plus walleye on quinte.  however, otherwise, I agree with your post 100%."
740924,Stoty,2012-10-30 23:03:00,2910," I'm gonna have to disagree with that. With the technology we have (cameras, taxidermy, etc), there's absolutely no reason to keep a trophy fish these days as the replica's are identical and a lot of the time look even better than the actual fish.  What's the point of harvesting a 15lb Walleye anyways? The meat isn't great from a fish that old.  Edit to add: I had a client in 2010 catch a walleye that went just over 10lbs. It was hooked deep and was bleeding pretty badly. He obviously had the option to keep it..and declined, and since I knew there was a good shot at the fish not making it, I decided to not let it go to waste and kept it myself. The meat was JUNK. It was a greyish colour and rubbery."
740933,Rich Nelson,2012-10-30 23:29:00,332,Stoty gets it. Let the big ones spread their genes. Replicas are a great option.
740934,Steve,2012-10-30 23:30:00,2075,"ummmmm, well, for one, replica's look like toys, and they aren't even close to looking like your fish.  they only look like a mold that the replica artist may have on hand.  salmonoids and walleye look absolutely brutal done by replica's...and i'm talking the good ones, you know, from advanced.  i promise you, when, not if, but when I catch my trophy walleye it will be bonked, put on ice, and mounted the way I want it - a skin mount.  otherwise I might as well just give my credit card number to advanced and order me a trophy.  replica's are fine for guys who want the toys on the wall, but for a true trophy hunter, there is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a true trophy...."
740937,Stoty,2012-10-30 23:35:00,2910," Whatever floats your boat, I guess."
740940,Steve,2012-10-30 23:43:00,2075,"BB, to further your point, a fish has no genetics to spread when they reach ""true"" trophy status.  its like having your great grandfather trying to procreate.  many studies have been done that point to the lack of fertility in advanced aged fish.  it is a great thought however. thankfully the human race didn't follow it, or we all wouldn't be here right now."
740946,Rich Nelson,2012-10-31 00:05:00,332,"Well to some a 8lb walleye is worth a skin mount. To others its a 14lb. I realize that people keeping trophy fish to ""stuff"" isnt a big concern for numbers in a fishery. Its the anglers keeping their limits every time they fill them to eat. Lower density fish such as Musky are a different story. Release them so they can reproduce, or be enjoyed by another angler. And there are replicas that look as good as a skin mount. ( and they will last a lot longer)"
740952,Steve,2012-10-31 00:10:00,2075,"I agree with you there.  We have released 6 walleye 14lbs or greater - none 15lbs however.  90% of anglers would consider those wall mounts.  we also released a 24.5lbs brown trout. again, another fish that likely most would consider a wall mount.  however, all were released.  when I do catch a trophy, a true trophy (16lbs walleye, 25lbs brown, etc) I will kill it to stuff. i wont feel bad doing so either.  replica's are ok for big fish, but a true trophy, nothing wrong with putting that on your wall. i'd hate to have the mnr say to me that I cannot keep my trophy."
741071,laszlo,2012-10-31 13:40:00,487,I would have no issue with a no kill for all river run trout after the 30th of Sept.
741074,Gregoire,2012-10-31 13:54:00,1397,"AS has been pointed out the real problem here is enforcement. The government of Ontario either does not have, or is unwilling to commit the resources to enforce our current fishing regulations. Going to to a tag limit, which I think is a great idea, or a no kill system is not possible without first having access to enforce those limits. This would mean a massive increase in the amount of CO's that are on the water. I have fished many highly pressured water ways in the past year, and on weekends as well. Not once have I come across a CO this year. Something like a CO on the water in every major lake in the Kawarthas, and multiple CO's on a lake like Simcoe would be needed. At the very least CO's stationed at boat launches at the end of the day to check anglers catches at the end of the day. The greatest ideas in the world are useless unless we are able to act upon them."
741077,Rich,2012-10-31 14:10:00,3927,"Selective harvest is often a very good thing for most waterbodies, it keeps populations in check and allows a larger population of trophy class fish, so i'd have to disagree. And im 95% c&r."
741079,BillM,2012-10-31 14:14:00,17367, So you think everyone would just disobey the law and keep fish regardless?  Most people out there obey the law without having to have a CO standing behind them.
741082,adolson,2012-10-31 14:20:00,783," At $15 for an average rainbow trout fillet, my wallet can tell the difference."
741094,kemper,2012-10-31 14:53:00,2232," Have you eaten a steak, chicken, pig, etc lately?  Antibiotic use in Ontario aquaculture is low...VERY low compared to other types of farmed animal.  Somewhere around 2%-3% of Ontario farmed trout receive any form of antibiotics, and they are only administered when needed - not included in regular feed like other agriculture.  There is also a wait period after fish are fed antibiotics to ensure low residual value.  Just putting it out there, after working in the agriculture industry I would much rather eat a farmed fish than anything else from a farm."
741097,jimmer,2012-10-31 14:56:00,2730,"I don't like putting in regulations or laws that are based on the few (abusers/poachers), rather than the many. Enforcement with heavy consequences is the answer. Unfortunately, no kill is playng into the hands of you know who."
741129,ch312,2012-10-31 17:50:00,1590," lol...don't get so defensive, it implies guilt   i wasn't implying you do this as i haven't a clue about your fishing practices, but we're all aware this happens everywhere. i just don't see how someone can justify targeting one species and harvesting the eggs to help them catch a ""better"" fish. i guess it's the main reason why i'd fully support a ban on the use of roe.   as far as buying fish vs wild caught. we all know it costs much more to catch them ourselves, but i think most of us are just fine with that."
741135,rob v,2012-10-31 18:13:00,535,"I would support lower catch and possession limits - but more importantly I would support more and better enforcement of our existing limits/rules.  As someone said earlier - unfortunately some people can't be trusted to do anything by the book -  take a limit, put it in the car and go back and start again ??? Those kind of folks should be fined, have their equipment taken away and be banned from the sport !!  But we need enforcement."
741137,Gregoire,2012-10-31 18:13:00,1397," I hate it when people only quote a part of post, that way they can skew your opinio. If you would take the time to read my post you would see that I do not think that there is a point in making rules that are impossible to enforce given the current amount of resources we devote to policing. Although the majority of citizens are law abiding, there is a minority that would realize that enforcement is lacking and would do what they want, much like the situation that exists now. While throwing around ideas and discussing this topic is worhtwhile, if we really value and want to protect our fishery we need to devote a lot more money to managing the resource. Unfotunately that would mean either taking money away from other departments, raising taxes overall, or taxing fisherman at a much higher rate. Personally I would be ok with raising taxes overall, or paying more for my fishing liscence, provided I knew the money was going to maintain the fishery. I realize that I am in the majority on this issue."
740495,kemper,2012-10-29 14:55:00,2232," I agree 100% Bill - would be nice if people understood ""selective harvest""..."
740497,jedimaster,2012-10-29 14:56:00,3472," Whens the last time you caught and release 25 walleye in a day?  I hear what you are saying and when I fish for something that is sensitive to release, like walleye, I tend to catch what I want to keep and then go fish for something else. I don't think I would support a 100% no kill, but I would support some sort of rotating No Keep on certain species in certain areas.EG Kawartha Walleye... rotate the lakes so that they each rotatoe CnR every other year or something like that."
740515,ecmilley,2012-10-29 15:33:00,2163,"Not at all, as usual it's getting so that people jump on others for even entertaining the idea of keeping a fish what ever happened to enjoying your catch? with regards to the rivers I say shut it down if it's that big of a problem i guess playing out large fish on 2lb test isn't gonna kill anyfish, if people were really concerned about fish welfare then they would actually use line rated to what there fishing for but i guess there's no sport in that."
740516,torco,2012-10-29 15:39:00,656, This pretty much sums up my position.
740518,misfish,2012-10-29 15:54:00,29133," Sunday was blown big time. Oh well.LOL   I cant see that stretch being closed to C&R for ever Bill,but it is nice to have and yes,others are watching to make sure no fish are taken. Eventually though, it will get over populated .I think anyways. They will need to open certian parts of it to catch and keep, to sustain the population. NO??????   Oh BTW Theres a big white sign posted there now. Fishing access fee. It,s no for fishing,it,s for access to the land to fish, the fish, you have to release.LOL  I may have to reconcider buying one now,as I enjoy it to much to be hasseled."

740521,Fisherman,2012-10-29 16:12:00,7201," Back in the years before the limit came out for perch, there were motorhomes equipped with multiple freezers, electric fish cleaning drums, etc that sat at the Narrows in Atherley in the campground by the bridge.  Those loaded freezers went south and made a healthy profit from our resources.  Nowadays without naming anyone/race/etc, fish get gutted, ground up and fish burgers/soup are made from them.  Maybe that's why we need limits, but definitely not the other solution."
740522,12footspringbok,2012-10-29 16:14:00,459," You were fishing the wrong part of that river yesterday...   If you guys think the C&R section is the only thing that has made the fish stocks in said river better you're wrong IMO.  Sure its  helped but I think conditions in the lake, summer weather, and the drop from 5 fish to 2 fish limit has played a much bigger part.   I could go on but it would be like beating a dead horse with a stick."
740528,Jon,2012-10-29 16:30:00,209,No kill - no. Lower catch and possession limits - Absolutely!  Jon
740608,chris.brock,2012-10-29 22:32:00,4053,"I'd rather catch fish, instead of trying to fill the freezer or show my neighbors how much of a man I am because I caught this stringer of fish, so I would support a move in that direction  introduced stuff (salmon, bows) or put and take stocking systems, I don't care  there's way too much fishing pressure in most of Ontario, the fishing gets better around Thunder Bay and west from there (more lakes and less fishing pressure)"
740612,Steve,2012-10-29 22:42:00,2075,"Fish Farmer, to add to your point, they also allow fishing for the spawning fish, with the fish spawn itself!"
740617,Dutch,2012-10-29 22:58:00,831,"Just some point form thoughts:  1) No kill would never work - no where near the man power to enforce it  2) Even if it were introduced, people break the rules all the time as it is, they will continue to do it  3) Everyone needs to worry more about what they personally do when fishing.  In general people worry way to much about what others do."
740635,Snidley,2012-10-29 23:47:00,620,"There's no question that some people are scofflaws or only prepared to follow laws they agree with but the vast majority of anglers will follow the law just because it's the law. They will also self police those situations on the river when someone is breaking the law in obvious fashion. Here's what works elsewhere  A) Make people display their fishing license on the outside of their clothing, the investigative aspect is obvious, the self policing aspect would be omnipresent on stream. B)have large no kill, no bait, single hook, no barbs region, like the GTA as an example. Guys who wanted to, would learn effective ways of catching fish in this area without one bait , specifically roe and with no incentive to harvest a toxic waste dump and feed it to those you love, anglers would release all of the fish for angling seconds, thirds, etc.. C) Ban roe fishing, at least in pressured areas as it is still far and away the most egregious aspect of the ""harvest- no harvest issue. And the most hardcore guys rabidly cling to it despite the fact Ontario is the last province where it's legal..  The biggest problem in Ontario is that the fisheries law has been ""harmonized"" one of the weak ass legal speak terms a government uses to make it's job easy. Ontario's Fisheries law is easy to understand, easy to enforce but the results are ultimately harmful to the basic issue, ie., fish abundance and respect for the law in a recreational pursuit that includes death as a byproduct. Our province has to get serious about the laws of conservation that are based on conservation not ease of understanding"
740641,chris.brock,2012-10-29 23:58:00,4053,"I have to disagree with you on some of that BB  I can't remember a stressed, heavily fished, fishery in Southern or Central Ontario, that suddenly corrects itself and produces bumper crops  the heavily funded fisheries are basically put and take, mostly with non native or introduced species, it's sort of like fishing in the big swimming pool for rainbows at the Toronto Sportsmen Show."
740662,Sinker,2012-10-30 02:13:00,8692," Ever fish the kawartha's?? They go thru cycles, and it has NOTHING to do with fishing pressure.  trent severn waterway is the biggest culprit. When spawning beds are left high and dry for a few years, you notice the decline in fish populations. The years we have high water in the trent, we get lots of fish. It happens. Check the scugog walleye population right now....check it again in 3-4 years. I've seen it happen in all the kawartha lakes I fish.  S."
740692,Grimace,2012-10-30 03:29:00,2020,I like to eat the odd fish every once in a while.  If this silly rule was in effect the poachers would still poach and I would not get to keep a fish every now and again.

The bio behind this move is a personal friend Who lives and breathes Steel.He learned the effects of catch and release sections on the Grand from back in the day. He was the brown trout sections personal bio.We went from being unable to really sample any second year fish. To more big fish than small fish. Turned it into a world class flyfishing destination.

I am 100% for a no kill law on low density species that arent table fare ( or on species with low numbers on certain waterbodies that need help.) Lower limits should be put in place as well.  Things like slot sizes are proven to help a struggling fishery, as Im sure lower limits would as well. Lowering limits would be much more cost effective than trying to stock a waterbody that has been destroyed by over angling."

740411,BillM,2012-10-29 03:47:00,17367, The best thing about No Kill sections on particular stretches of river is that it's just not the CO's making sure people aren't taking fish.  It's all the other anglers as well..

Out west I believe they have lakes that limit access to public (limit effort not kill).  There are a few sanctuary lakes in the province where you can see how amazingly good fishing can be but I've never seen this on rivers excluding Portage Creek.  Most sanctuaries are up north and remote.

740459,ch312,2012-10-29 13:10:00,1590," out of curiosity, how did you come to the conclusion that there has been an ""over-harvest"" of trout and salmon this year?"
740463,Fish Farmer,2012-10-29 13:36:00,2234,"NO! Can you imagine if there was less Muskie in our waters, we wouldn't need a slot limit on Walleye. OH those bacon wrapped Walleye filet's MMMMMMM OK I'm gone."
740464,Christopheraaron,2012-10-29 13:39:00,3525,"I would not support a %100 no kill, but I would support a tagging system or reduced limits. I don't see the need however to keep fish like muskie, apart from a mount (which you can get a replica of) there is no use for them."
740465,kemper,2012-10-29 13:39:00,2232,"  This is very far from the truth. Ontario's aquaculture industry is one of the best in the world, and most of our fish farmers are very responsible with their practices. Have you eaten an Ontario farmed trout lately? Anyone who thinks they can tell the difference is lying to themselves.  True, there are MANY examples of bad aquaculture around the world. The key is to know where your fish comes from, and what it was fed. Tilapia for example, is a fish that should be avoided at all costs unless you know exactly where it came from. I'll give you a hint, the answer is often China.    Agreed, the number of fish in the ""eater size"" range in that system is astounding.    Take a walk along the shore of a Gbay or Huron trib and see for yourself. Or hang out for the day and watch people take limit after limit back to the car, campsite, trailer, etc.  It's pretty clear that humans can't be trusted to do anything sustainably, and this seems to be no different.   Again for the record I have no problem with sustainable harvest of any fish, the key word there being sustainable. I would think the hunters out there would raise hell if in that system you could get away with going out every day and blasting a deer without any chance of repercussion."
740467,Fish Farmer,2012-10-29 13:50:00,2234,"One thing I can't figure, is why do they allow fishing for Trout in rivers while they are spawning. Other fish species are closed. Might not need to stock as many. Just saying."
740470,Fisherman,2012-10-29 14:06:00,7201, You've been drinking that special Whitby water again haven't you.
740472,fishnsled,2012-10-29 14:10:00,3520,"A for a no kill policy - No.   So true. We like to think we did our best to revive them properly but the is no guarantee that they will not died is the next couple of days. And for those that don't take the time for help the fish to revive, should have just kept it. Obviously certain fish will bounce back better then others and time of year (water temps) play a big role.    Absolutely!! The last thing I want is for our heritage of fishing to become a catch a kill one. Can't imagine going perch fishing and killing everyone I caught up to my limit or any other species for that matter. Selective harvest."
740473,Billy Bob,2012-10-29 14:12:00,5865,"BELIEVE IT OR NOT we have some closet P3TA folks among us...they, might not even realize it themselves...  95% of the time the reason you have poor population of fish and the lack of good fishing is NOT because of ANGLER fishing but many environmental factors instead...some we understand and many we don't. And then out of the blue, the problems correct themselves and we have a bumper crop of walleye, bass, crappie, etc......and then the cycle repeats itself after a couple of good years...  By doing away with keeping any fish, you will no doubt lower the amount of fishermen and they are the ones FUNDING many of the programs to increase populations of fish in your area."
740482,kemper,2012-10-29 14:36:00,2232," I get it Billy Bob, natural factors are always at play. I'm not sure I agree with the 95%, there are lots of examples of fishery collapse due to over-fishing (commercial and sport alike).  From what I gather the majority would not support a no kill - that's understandable, I like eating the buggers too. There does seem to be some interest in altering the regulation system though. Of course, we all know that disaster what would cause...  I think the biggest difference between today and our ""heritage"" is the sheer number of angler and commercial pressure on the stocks.  Has anyone noticed the impact of the 2010 opening of ice fishing in the Kawarthas? I noticed almost immediately that panfish were smaller, I wonder how many good sized fish went home in white buckets the past 2 winters...  Again, problem is not with ice fishing OR keeping fish but maybe we need to rethink the limits - 300 sunfish, 30 crappie, 50 perch seems crazy to me..."
740487,BillM,2012-10-29 14:43:00,17367,"Who in there right mind would ever wanna fillet 300 sunfish?  LOL!  I think No Kill has it's place.. certain rivers, certain times, certain sections along with things like selective harvest...    If we make sure the fishery is kept healthy, there should be zero impact when someone wants 2 for the table."
740488,Freshtrax,2012-10-29 14:45:00,2215,That's why I liked the idea of tags.  You can have a few good fish frys a year but you can't kill 150 fish 50 times a year.
740367,kemper,2012-10-29 02:07:00,2232,"I enjoy eating fish as much as the next guy, no question. I had a wicked Atlantic salmon fillet for dinner tonight, usually eat fish 3x per week.  That said, it's almost always store bought and sustainably farmed. I did some consulting type work in the aquaculture industry so I have the benefit of knowing most of the operations in the province, but for the most part Ontario does a pretty decent job.  Here's my question -  If it came down to a vote, would you support a no-kill on your favourite species?  What about a partial no-kill? Lake/river rotations? Tag systems (annual limits)?  I'm leaving panfish out of this one, let's talk musky, bass, trout, salmon etc.  I can honestly say that I would back a no-kill 100% on every species I fish, but I suspect that I'm in the minority. A more reasonable option might be an annual tag system, where you can take your limit (say, 10?) on a single day, or over the course of the entire year as you please provided you have the ""tags"" for the fish.  I haven't thought out the logistics here, so don't jump on me for that one.  Just a thought. The over-harvest that I've seen this year is worse than ever, and to be honest is sickening.  Cheers,"
740369,Joeytier,2012-10-29 02:11:00,3990,"I would support it in areas where it most needed, yes."
740372,Live2fish85,2012-10-29 02:13:00,1633,I don't agree and I rarely keep fish other then perch.
740373,irishfield,2012-10-29 02:17:00,26272,"We need a 54"" or better to ""Kill"" on GBay when it comes to Muskie as it is. That said, those that think they ""swam away for another day"" need to take a better look in the mirror most days anyhow. Many days I just think it would be better to catch your limit on what ever you're fishing, call it a day and bring them home. Doing so would = less dead fish in the system!"
740374,HyperActive,2012-10-29 02:20:00,56,"I used to fish and hike with the same buddy in Ontario and B.C. In my opinion he had no regard for nature of any sort. He almost killed us both twice no less!!!   I think because of him I always carry a garbage bag with me and he has helped turn me into a catch and releaser only.  He was/is a pretty good guy but seriously lacked common sense when dealing with mother nature.  I can imagine and have seen the negative effects he left behind, I can only imagine the effects a small minority of fishermen have on some species.  I would back a no kill movement,"
740375,kemper,2012-10-29 02:20:00,2232,"  A good point - I've watched countless Muskies dragged in to the dock to be shown off to friends and then ""released"". Might as well have bbq'ed that fish because it's toast anyway..."
740377,Acountdeleted,2012-10-29 02:26:00,2562,I would agree. I could pass on taking walleye home if everyone (or most people) were playing by the rules.  As long as I get to keep a few perch and Crappie I'd still be happy.
740380,bigugli,2012-10-29 02:31:00,6138,"To say ""no kill"" is the same as banning fishing for a species. There is no possible way for one to guarantee a released fish survives the stress and exhaustion from the fight."
740381,irishfield,2012-10-29 02:32:00,26272, Edzakery and what my point was... anyone that thinks otherwise go join P3TA now and just shut us fisher folks down for ever!
740384,ChrisK,2012-10-29 02:35:00,2772,Although it might be good for fish populations it would definitely infringe on the rights of fisherman to keep there possession limits so I would say no. It kinda reminds me of that useless gun registration law they just got rid of. All it did was make life difficult for all of us law abiding gun owners instead of going after the crooks that use guns to commit crime. If you want to see poachers behind bars then that's who you have to go after.
740387,Twocoda,2012-10-29 02:38:00,4130,i wouldnt support a no kill unless the species was over culled and require it to be....i would be a strong supporter of a tag system and more stringent sanctuaries though eg. 2 feet or less...no fishing regardless if it outside an already existing sanctuary
740389,fishdawg,2012-10-29 02:45:00,912,NO
740391,BillM,2012-10-29 02:47:00,17367,"Already a no-kill section in my home river, more rivers up this way need it."
740392,jerdog,2012-10-29 02:49:00,39,Bigugli has it bang on.  The only no kill is no fishing.  It's a big range but the average reported here (MNR C&R guidelines) suggests 16% of fish released die.  If you catch and release 25 walleye you have the same impact as a guy that keeps a limit and quits.
740393,kickingfrog,2012-10-29 02:50:00,8333,"I guess I would ask what is the purpose of a catch and release only? Is to protect a particular species? Or a particular species and/or a body of water?  If taking some fish, however restricted, harms the fishery then more is likely need then just a no keep regulation.  Another potential problem is that some anglers will just go somewhere else and put more pressure on another body of water."
740394,kemper,2012-10-29 02:52:00,2232," I disagree, it simply means you aren't allowed to intentionally kill the fish for consumption. No-kill sections of certain water bodies have been successful in Ontario, and there are many examples on the West coast as well.  Do some fish die? Inevitably yes, but a released fish has a much better chance at survival than one on a rope...  By that logic I have to stop fishing after I have a limit because catch and release isn't possible?    Trust me, the last thing I want to do is give P3TA any credit. I've spent 15 days on the water since October 1 and caught/released a whole trolley of fish, if I wasn't able to fish I'd be in the loonie bin by now...    Straightforward point, taken and respected."
740398,kickingfrog,2012-10-29 03:01:00,8333," The ability of fish to survive varies so much from species to species, time of year, gear used, depth of water and skill of the angler that it is difficult to put a catch all percent to it. And other studies have shown that the numbers are lower then what was once believed do to angler education and experience.  Twenty five years ago how common was it for anglers to release many/most of their fish?"
740399,Freshtrax,2012-10-29 03:08:00,2215,"I like the tag idea.  I dunno max 50 sport fish, 500 pan fish/perch .   Most fisherman would not take their fifty a year.  But it would cut down on the people who take 1000's a year."
740400,jerdog,2012-10-29 03:12:00,39,"Here's the section of the report where the 16% came from:  ""The impact of mortality caused by catch-and-release practices is often underestimated by both anglers and fishery managers. From a review of 118 catch-and-release studies (Appendix 1), which, in total, involved over 120,000 fish, the average mortality associated with catch-and-release angling was 16.2%. Thus, while many anglers may assume that by practising catch-and-release they are having no impact on the fish population, a significant number of released fish may die."""
740401,hammercarp,2012-10-29 03:13:00,964,No. There is something wrong with the idea of not being able to eat the things that grow here. I have a great idea though. More people should fish for carp. This would help take the pressure of other species. This is especially true in S. Ontario's more densely populated areas. Carp are a tough fish and can handle C&R if handled with a little care. Our carp angling group has pictures of carp caught multiple times over a many year period. I am serious about this. It is part of the reason I took up carp angling and chose to help promote the sport.
740403,BillM,2012-10-29 03:15:00,17367, There's been a big swing in C&R techniques in the past few years.   That report was done when?  2005?
740404,northernpike56,2012-10-29 03:21:00,717,"No. I like keeping fish, if it's bass, walleye, perch, crappie, trout, or even pike on a particular day. That said, I think that it was a pretty good idea to introduce no-kill regs on some very well known trout streams in S. Ontario. Combine that with stocking, and you have a pretty neat fishery that wouldn't happen if these things were not put into place.  I think it would be cool with most people if the size limits were raised higher for muskie, but I can't really say anything too much more about that species because I am not a muskie angler, and really know nothing about the fish.  Basically, I think if everybody followed their limits, and was a 'conservative' angler at most times, we should have no problem with our fisheries (large waterbodies I'm speaking of). I also love the idea of stocking a bunch of fish in the more well-populated areas in S. Ontario that really couldn't handle as much fishing pressure that they get if they were just wild fish. I can think of 1 huge example of a success by stocking (Lake O!!)  Matt."
740405,kemper,2012-10-29 03:23:00,2232," I think the stocking thing goes both ways. Certainly can increase the population and if done right genetic diversity and ""wild strain"" can be kept in tact, but it also seems to make people think its OK to kill everything you catch."
740408,kickingfrog,2012-10-29 03:29:00,8333, The report was done in 2005 but some of the studies used were from the 1955's. Just scan down to the appendix.
740409,bigugli,2012-10-29 03:36:00,6138,"Truth is there are far too many yahoos fishing the ""tribs"" in southern Ontario. You want to see just how bad? Just going hurrying along the river bank, muttering to all that you pass, 'the CO's just showed up'. Amazing to see how many pack up and scurry away. There is no effective enforcement beyond token appearances. Adding another layer of restrictions and regulations will not change a thing."
