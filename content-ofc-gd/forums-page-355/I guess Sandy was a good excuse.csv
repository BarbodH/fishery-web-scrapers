741605,lew,2012-11-02 09:24:00,12766,"Looks like Hurricane Sandy was a good excuse for the oil companies to hike the gas prices.  Just when the cost of gas was coming down, prices in the Peterboro region jumped 11 cents yesterday afternoon.  Everybody else see the same thing in your areas ??"
741606,fishindevil,2012-11-02 10:07:00,6254,"yes i did lew in the lindsay area,but now its back to $113.5 in manila on hwy 7  !!!  i gassed up monday as well knowing it was gonna spike,and it probly will as they are saying theres a gas shotage now in the american seaboard as many stations are damaged and cant get gas !!!"
741610,ketchenany,2012-11-02 10:59:00,3229,Lew they don't need an excuse!   :wallbash:
741615,SlowPoke,2012-11-02 11:33:00,2984,"Flying J in Napanee was $1.10 yesterday, $1.23 today."
741617,outllaw,2012-11-02 11:37:00,1232,in windsor 123.9  got mine at 117.9. no lew they didnt clean the windshield or check my oil either lol.
741618,lew,2012-11-02 11:41:00,12766," I shoulda filled up here yesterday morning for $1.09 George, I'm heading down your way in about 4 hours."
741619,ecmilley,2012-11-02 11:52:00,2163,"I don't even look anymore, but the pump clicked off at $108 so it must of been down when i fueled up."
741620,Rizzo,2012-11-02 11:56:00,4754,that is just ridiculous...the gas at the stations has been inventoried LONG before any effects of Sandy were felt. It is exactly what Lew said - an excuse
741625,Snowball,2012-11-02 12:13:00,167,"Price in Thunder Bay went from 1.329 to 1.349.  Regards, Snowball"
741628,mercman,2012-11-02 12:32:00,7054,It actually dropped to 127.9 here yesterday
741635,fishindevil,2012-11-02 13:10:00,6254,"i know,they were showing some stations had 2 hr line-ups and a guy acually pulled a gun on another motorist who budded in line !!!! thats just bizzare...."
741636,misfish,2012-11-02 13:17:00,29133,Cost me 65 buxs to fill up today. Damit.  Dont miss the truck fill ups.
741646,gaspumper,2012-11-02 14:14:00,393,Hwy 2 at Shannonville is $1.03.9
741649,Sour_Squirrel,2012-11-02 14:22:00,196,Some oil sheik in Saudi could cut his finger and that will be reason enough for the oil companies to raise prices !!!
741668,Tdel,2012-11-02 16:02:00,393,The regular gas prices in Midland/Penetanguishene range from a low of 115.3 to a high of 119.9 Same price as yesterday.  I was waiting for them to use the hurricane as an excuse to raise the prices. Of course we know they don't need an excuse because they have that excuse wheel that they spin whenever they need any extra cash and where it stops is the excuse of the day.  Tom
741673,TJQ,2012-11-02 16:13:00,7806,1.22 today which is lower than yesterdays 1.24

741736,irishfield,2012-11-02 19:49:00,26272,"Just last week you weren't worried about what fuel was gonna cost you for that new truck Lew?  Let us know how the trip to LSC went... with the Ecoboost running rich for the first 5k or so to break it in. Those extra litres/100km, not being burned, could have offset that price rise!    Seriously, I want to know your fuel mileage."
741746,fishnsled,2012-11-02 20:38:00,3520, I'd be curious as well. Been hearing mixed reviews through the grapevine. Best I heard was averaging around 750km per tank (110L I believe)
741760,Handlebarz,2012-11-02 21:15:00,3790,I filled up for $114 but it went up to $124. For anyone heading down here to fish lsc stop in tilbury and get fuel it was $117 today
