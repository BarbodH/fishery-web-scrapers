I probably know 5-6 people who have well over 300k KM on their cars and they are different companies/models.  Do you know how many people I've come across who don't even get their oil changed. My 02 Accord V6 has 310,000 KM and still going strong. Engine is still smooth as butter, but the maintenance issues are adding up. I need a new timing belt, all season and winter tires, and a few other minor fixes. I can probably get another 100,000 KM easily if I continue to take care of it.  Take it easy on the road and get it fix when you have a problem. I know it's easier said than done because I have a friend whose a mechanic who takes care of me.  Last night, I hit 9 red lights in a row with this other vehicle on Yonge Street in the middle of the night. When I saw the yellow light from a head, I would release my gas and slow my pace and by the time I got there, it was green and I accelerated at 30km/h. This guy stopped at every red light because he didn't drive smart. There were also no other cars except us two. That can't be good for the car to be driving with a such heavy foot, especially if you drive everyday. A lot of wear and tear."

But NHTSA also mentioned another possible cause: drivers pushing the gas instead of the brakes.  Many drivers may have confused the gas and brake pedals a problem that may account for ""the vast majority"" of the unintended acceleration incidents the agency investigated, NHTSA deputy administrator Ron Medford said at Tuesday's NHTSA press briefing.  ""What mostly happened was pedal misapplication where the driver stepped on the gas instead of the brake or in addition to the brake,"" Medford said.  OH...forgot to add this part too...  This summer, NHTSA released the results of some investigations into Toyota sudden acceleration incidents. Those investigations specifically looked into 58 alleged unintended acceleration cases. These investigations suggested that drivers themselves may have been partly at fault.  But I'm sure this is NOT even good enough for those Toyota haters....."

I'm not a Toyota hater at all, I just think the way they handled the entire issue is unbelievable.  Oh BTW, is your truck in the current 7.4 million vehicle recall for the faulty window switches?

The reality is though that my experience with Toyota or the Fords has zero impact on what the next Toyota or Ford would be like if I bought one.

Ah, later and the toyota and the rest of the herd try to copy the concept. But so far the Crapler has the top of units sold. Why? Why? Why? Because a smart guy said once: The quality is in numbers. How the heck is that? Let me explain suckers.  In WWII best tank built was the german Tiger. Pice of art. But in spite of the best tank the germans did not win the batle of Kursk (bigest ever battle as tanks number) and the war. Because the quality is in numbers. That was said by Stalin. And indeed, in some case the 'quality' is in numbers.  So if you have nothing to do with your cash spend it on expensive cars and brave all the time that yours is shine and better that mine. I have my path, not always more expensive is better. And ultimately all the cars Toyota or Crapler in 10 years end up in scrap yard. But I paid less and the suckers more.  Same story with the phones and all the comercial crap. Buy premium gasoline becasue is better for the pockets of the oil companies. Just seen to documentary on CBC (premium gas is just for a specific segment of cars and is a way to milk more money from suckers).  So in conclusion here is the sucker that likes the Crapler that don't give a crap on the shinier cars that any way will end up as rust in few years. Those one are for kids and teenagers. Have fun."

How many of these people knew enough to either switch the transmission to neutral or even pull the key out of the ignition. Toyota took full responsibility and instituted measures to rectify the problem and continues to formulate more safety related features because of this.  Chrapsler rode the minivan transmission fiasco into the 2000's with nary an admission of guilt or an apology to any of the millions of minivan owners.  General Morons rode sensor and relay fiascos for years as well as rack and pinion and front trans axle failures with the same ignorance and lack of admission.  I know I'm reaching but who knows how many incidents led to accidents and/or deaths.  I drive an 02 Sierra with 260,000k and love it. There are certain vehicles both manufacturers build that do have some merit but when either can build vehicle that will last 8 years, 223,000 kms, where no original parts are replaced other than brakes and a battery I might consider buying one because thats what our  04 Honda Accord has done for us.

Does anyone truly believe that vehicle manufacturers still make every single part in their vehicles? Amazing, if so, because it hasn't been that way for at least 25 years. With only a handful of very expensive exceptions (Lamborghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin, etc) the vast majority of car manufacturers outsource a large number of parts. Toyota didn't build the faulty gas pedals that sent their vehicles crashing into walls, they were sourced from a gas pedal manufacturer in Streetsville, Ontario. That company also sold gas pedals to other manufacturers besides Toyota.  All sorts of parts, like computer control modules, oxygen sensors, brakes, exhaust systems, rads, throttle assemblies, starters, you name it, are outsourced. It's the only way they can keep car prices down. If Toyota had to build every single part by themselves, a Corolla would cost more than $60,000 and no one would ever buy it.

741385,BillM,2012-11-01 17:39:00,17367," My '05 Jetta TDI makes about 180whp/330ftlbs as it sits.  Stock they are gutless, but they respond to mods extremely well.   Even a stock PD ('04-'06) with just a tune (ECU upgrade) will gain around 40hp/70ftlbs."

740925,Dutch,2012-10-30 23:05:00,831,"Is your tongue in your cheek BB?  The only reference in that article to GM is about the Cadillac brand and the Volt, which is way overpriced and has already gone through a recall.  Ground breaking news - Consumer Reports are getting more complaints about touch screens and fancy audio systems than they are 5 years ago.  These types of systems weren't even available 5 years ago.  I think the respnses to their survey are probably jaded this year - people are upset about the Government bail-outs and are more critical of domestic makers because of that.  To base reccomendations based on as little as 100 responses to a survey is irresponsible."
741060,blue pickeral,2012-10-31 12:46:00,267,"GM in their advertisements says they have top ratings in CONSUMERS DIGEST, a for- profit magazine sponsored by the car makers and others. Do not confuse this with Consumer REPORTS a non-profit organization. I won't even look at GM because of this sleazy tactic alone."
741069,BillM,2012-10-31 13:24:00,17367," I'm sure GM is very upset that you won't buy one of their vehicles, lol."
741073,moxie,2012-10-31 13:51:00,1566," IMO; I'm so glad to hear that I'm peeing my pants right now!!! Does this mean they can pay back the loan they were given by us to save the skeleton crew(compared to headier times) that operates in Motor City now????   I'm guessin' that the main reason General Morons is second from the top of the food chain is because they're giving their cars away for 84 MONTHS again and if memory serves me correctly they heavily leveraged against the monthly payments then too.   As far as the Volt goes, I surely hope that the plant that develops and manufactures them is hit by a Biblically Proportioned Bolt of Lightning(After hours of course), so they can at least recoup some of the hoards of money they have sunk into that $40,000+/ea Battery.   In my lifetime (since the 70's) has failed to truly understand the automotive experience as it should be for everyone involved in the process and that is why they are about to Fail once more. Hopefully this time will be the last time.    Edited because I my post was venturing into my usual ramblings that make eyes glaze over."
741109,blue pickeral,2012-10-31 15:31:00,267,"Yes, they are."
741111,BillM,2012-10-31 15:37:00,17367, Take your tinfoil hat off.
741115,Billy Bob,2012-10-31 16:24:00,5865," Me too....since a LONG time ago I did have one of their credit cards that earned points to use a money when purchasing a vehicle....If I remember correctly, I got just over $1800.00 off the price using those points...then shortly afterward they ended that program...and to today, GM still sends me the adds for their vehicles just as if I still had their GM Credit Card...  I am a customer of their online bank...""ALLY BANK""...best rates ANYWHERE..."
741122,Fish4Eyes,2012-10-31 16:57:00,1022,"IMO, it is well known nowadays that Toyota is one of the most reliable car makers. Just if they could make them sip less gas."
741123,BillM,2012-10-31 17:02:00,17367, Reliable at crashing itself into a wall.   No thanks..  Toyota isn't what it used to be in the 80's early 90's...

741141,BillM,2012-10-31 18:35:00,17367, Using Autotrader.ca as some sort of de facto standard on used cars....  Now THAT is funny!  LOL!!!!
741164,SlowPoke,2012-10-31 20:01:00,2984,Perhaps that is how you interpret the numbers. One could make the argument that Dodge owners are extremely reluctant to sell their reliable vehicles OR that Honda and Toyota automatics are problematic and should be disposed of beyond 300K.
741241,ch312,2012-11-01 00:06:00,1590," when was the last time you shopped for a cheaper car? i went through this last year to help a friend and ALL of the higher mileage and older big 3 cars were complete garbage. most ran rough, hard shifting, leaking fluids, tons of rust, horrible mpg, and many parts that can wear had tons of play or were broken. after seeing nothing but junk she decided to spend more money and we started looking at the imports with the same high mileage and it was like comparing apples to oranges. i'd say we looked at and drove about 12-14 cars total and it was very evident that the big 3 cars were junk and simply worn out.  if you'd read what i posted you'd see the point of posting those numbers is the cars from the big 3 are often scrapped or used in demo derbies when they're around the quarter mill mark while imports are still going strong. and no, these people aren't keeping their big 3 cars, they're selling them when they have much lower mileage.  you can use autotrader, kijiji, craigslist, used car dealers, etc to browse for yourself to see REAL WORLD stats on what holds up over the years and miles. but, i'm sure you'd rather listen to websites and magazines that just happen to be funded by the winning brand?"
741243,ch312,2012-11-01 00:09:00,1590," from what i've seen, your interpretation is the exact opposite of what really happens.  remember, this is for cars. the big 3 do build good trucks that last, providing it has a ram on the front"
741244,iFish4real,2012-11-01 00:13:00,386, they do...everywhere else except N. America they have TDI engines
741246,iFish4real,2012-11-01 00:19:00,386,imao...nobody beats the krauts at making cars
741249,moxie,2012-11-01 00:33:00,1566,Dodge builds a Truck for Skeeter and GM builds a Vette for Bubba. Do they make anything else worth driving? hehehe.

741262,big guy,2012-11-01 01:04:00,414," You do know that the case of the ""sticking gas pedal"" was proven to be 100% user error, don't you? No mechanical problems were found.  If there was ever a case of conflict of interest, it was this one, the American government, part owner of the big 3 NA auto makers leading an investigation into problems with a rival auto maker. As the sales stats show above, it looks like it backfired."
741266,BillM,2012-11-01 01:30:00,17367," Find me the article that states all those unintended acceleration issues were due to user error... I'll save you the hassle, you can't.   But feel free to prove otherwise.  You probably believe 9/11 was a government conspiracy as well eh?   The tinfoil hat crowd is strong on this board."
741269,Joeytier,2012-11-01 01:37:00,3990,"Even if I were to completely ignore the discrepancy in overall quality, it's quite clear that 'import' vehicle manufacturers are typically providing much better working environments for its production employees, often without unions.  I say this as an employee of a former GM affiliate.  Not to mention Mexican Motors and El Fordo are outsourcing to foreign plants with god awful living standards, and 'import' brands continue to increase North American production.  The line between foreign and domestic may as well not even exist anymore.  ...and I love my Tundra."
