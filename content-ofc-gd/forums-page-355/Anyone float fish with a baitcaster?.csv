741661,thalweg,2012-11-02 15:19:00,112," Its a super pleasurable outfit to fish with.  The strain on my body after a full day on the water has been reduced substantially. The sensitivity and rod power usually puts me firmly in control when fighting fish. Usually ... the odd 12+ lbr in the sticks is unpredictable...but with this setup and my line choices, it gives me much better chances than what I normally see on the river.  As you would expect the drag is as smooth as they come.  I usually set it relatively light and augment with my thumb for full braking power when needed.  Jumping bows affect the degree of drag vs them screaming down stream, so it requires variable drag coefficients that a thumb and drag combo can offer.  In moments when I'm blessed with good timing and an extraordinary high volume of fish, then I'll crank it right down and experiment laying the boots to them.  When those opportunities arise, the fight, simply put, is just violent. Half the length of time of the usual battle, but exponentially higher force and energy felt through the rod.  Oh and I should add, that I don't use puny hooks anymore either.  Gone are the 12's and 14's (unless I'm single egging) now I up size to 6's and 8's and some times even 4's for great lakes steelhead. I only fish super gin clear conditions now with a fly rod and natural flies...so don't require that super stealthy approach.  My landing ratio has gone way up since then...and I have the confidence of putting as much strain as I can on the fish with minimal hook problems."
741663,solopaddler,2012-11-02 15:38:00,8605,"That's pretty cool, I think that type of combo will definitely have a place in my arsenal at some point.  I'm with you on the larger hooks as well."
741693,Sharkbait22,2012-11-02 17:07:00,297," Hi Waterrunner do you mean 10.5 ft Avid?  I can't find a 11.5 in their current catalog. Older model?  Is that a Core 50 or 100?  AVC106MLF2 10'6"" ML Fast 2 6 - 10 1⁄ 8 - 5⁄8 6.2 5 $ 260 AVC106MF2 10'6"" M Fast 2 8 - 12 1 ⁄ 4 - 3 ⁄ 4 6.9 5 $ 260  I was thinking the 6-10lb range for my purposes - I fish the lower productivity waters of the north mostly.  Thanks again.."
741703,thalweg,2012-11-02 17:31:00,112," My error and apologize...it is indeed the AVC106MF2.  The ML is to light for my approach.  Core 50 with 7.1 ratio. If you are into longer drifts then I suggest something with a bit more line capacity.  I use sunline 10lb MONO which has the smallest diameter I can find for mono, but am still experimenting with that.  I don't recommend braid or flouro for main line.  Braid gets messed up in freezing temps and flouro usually sinks.. Mono with line butter applicant keeps it supple and floating on the tail end of medium drift lengths.  I rarely drift past 30 yards..very rarely and can still toss hardware way past that if required."
741716,Snidley,2012-11-02 18:35:00,620,"It certainly won't work with a Core 50 sized reel because it is thick line, but, P Line HydroFloat line is not only great on a pin or spin reel it also excels on a baitcaster. It's braid that  not only floats but it does not take on water like regular braid (it's coated like a flyline) and it's high visibility colour as well as its floating properties make it the best line for floatfishing IMO. Those 10'6"" Avids definitely sound like the ticket but I would go with the lighter one, the ML version, as it will be more fun for any fishing in colder water where the fish don't have the same power."
741729,thalweg,2012-11-02 19:24:00,112,"Great tip...I'll check that line out.  The Core is just about the smallest you'd want to go or get away with. (i choose it more for weight)  I tried the ML and don't recommend it.  Even if I let off and take it easy, it had a tough time taming 6lb fish or better.  It reached its maximum bend to early in my opinion. It was a disappointing experience and having to go back to the shop to upgrade it was another time waster.  Just my opinion...some folks really like the super spongy feel of light noodle rods.  I personally think it disconnects you from the sensitivity and energy from a fish."
741730,misfish,2012-11-02 19:28:00,29133," Not sure about the baitcaster,but I used this line on my pin,and I will say,it was of it in about 3 weeks.It was coming apart,coating was coming off. The second spool I bought,I used it as backing."

741737,Snidley,2012-11-02 19:54:00,620,"Trying the rod out is always great advice. Buying from a store that will swap out for a different rating is another great piece of advice.  I think sometimes if you fish with braid the whippy feel is diminished somewhat. A lot depends on how much weight you feel like chucking too. I have my 9'6"" for hardware so it's a floating only rod for me. In the end I will actually turn up with my reel in hand then string the rod to see what it feels like loaded up. I know that with St Croix their Wild River vs Avid,vs Legend Elite steelhead rods all feel and perform different, as per rated parameters, than one would think. Not brand consistant like say Loomis or Fenwick."
741741,Snidley,2012-11-02 20:07:00,620,"I never used my pin all day long. In addition I used a spin rod, baitcaster on all outings. I know that pin anglers at the Whirlpool blow through line at an amazing rate because of the strong flow, and rocks as well as the need for max casts on heavy weight. Most guys use slip bobbers but they still drop tons of line from twist, abrasion and casting issues. The travails of being a one rod angler I think. Possibly you have to change out the Hydro line frequently. Even with the expense and hassle I like the Hydrofloat to the same point I like braid on every other rig I own. I never use mono of any sort except for leader."

741469,Sharkbait22,2012-11-01 21:50:00,297," Awesome.  Thanks for the advice.  I have some friends just getting into the sport that might be interested in this too bc they have decent bait casters but no float rod.  There are a lot of times and places when fish (steelhead salmon etc) hit a spinner or spoon much better than a bead.  The ability to do both with one outfit is appealing (cuts down on the rods too).  So is a Calcutta 200 the way to go?  There's a new version in a 300, too big?"
741479,solopaddler,2012-11-01 22:02:00,8605,"Just to add to the post, here's my thoughts on the topic.  I believe using a baitcaster is advantageous because of its versatility and the lightness of the reels. Paired with a suitable rod they're a joy to fish.  That said I find float fishing with a centerpin to be more effective in all but the largest flows. I also enjoy fighting fish much more on a long light rod and single action reel.  I also fish with hardware a ton which constantly forces me to carry two rods on the stream. A huge pita at times, but that's the way I roll.  I don't believe a baitcaster would be as fun or efficient to fish hardware with as my custom 11' CTS and magnesium bodied spinning reel.  So the bottom line is unless I'm fishing the Black river at Lake O's east eand, the Genessee in Rochester, the Niagara, or some of the flows in Michigan I'm not fishing a baitcaster. I'm carrying two rods and am usually pretty successful doing so.  I can completely understand why someone may choose a more versatile option though."

You could get away with a 9 footer on our smaller streams but i wouldn't go much less. 11 ish feels just perfect to me in nearly all river types the Great Lakes has to offer.  I avoid the temptation for super long drifts that a long rod can induce.  Prefer to use my feet and gradually step down the pool or stretch to cover water.  It's getting tougher these days with the crowds to do so...but I've abandoned heavy crowd fishing decades ago so I fare well with that approach now a days.  I know the Calcutta 200 but don't have direct personal experience with them to offer any sound advice.  I use a Shimano core 7 to 1 ratio.  Does the trick nicely."

If you are serious about it, get it re-wrapped (or depending on the price, just buy a new stick) and do it right.

741380,thalweg,2012-11-01 17:08:00,112,"Sold my pin years ago..went bait caster and never looked back.  I find it far superior in almost every circumstance. Unmatched versatility.  A quality baitcaster will pay line as smoothly as the highest quality pins even in sub zero conditions.  I find most folks who got pins upgraded from a spinning outfit (rightly so btw) because its better than spinning.  But more likely felt they saw everyone else using it.   Pinning in my opinion is far over rated method.  If the fish are on a horizontal highspeed bite...try throwing hardware on a pin. Ain't gonna happen.  Casting distance, further assistance of quality drag (yes and the super sensitivity of using your thumb in tandem), complete removal of line twist, throw any bait/presentation you wish, light weight (if you spend the bucks on quality), reduced hand fatigue (can use gloves with it) faster retrieves with more casts per hour....the list of benefits go on and on.  A bit of practice with the weights completely off.  Yup you'll get the occasional birds nest first couple go arounds , but after that, pure steelhead fighting bliss.  Oh...and I long ago abandoned super whippy float rods and sub 4lb leader material. Simply foolish in almost 99% of all circumstances.  I now run 10 pound main and 8 pound flouro frog hair leader in most conditions with rare occasion of 6 lb tippet, and upgrade to 12 pound and 10 pound tippet in turbid conditions.

Almost always outfishes those around him. His casting distance and the water he can cover is the key. Darryl Chronzey and Lorne Green (LG Cusom and G. Loomis Canada) hooked up and did a show together many years ago using baitcasters on 11 1/2' IMX blanks built especially for baitcast reels. Probably early 90's. Darryl also did several magazine articles (Ontario Fisherman) close to twenty five years ago now using this method.

740206,Snidley,2012-10-28 15:32:00,620,"I used baitcasters floating for years now. I particularly liked the technique for big water, in winter, specifically the Niagara for me.  Years ago I met the chap who fishes the Saugeen with a baitcaster. We talked in detail because I also was running a baitcaster float rig. First off he uses a much longer rod than I would. I believe he uses a 14' rod. He also used at that time , an Abu C3 or C4 reel. Again just like BC, but in my opinion a really hack reel. Personally I used a Calcutta 201 first and then I moved to a Daiwa Millionaire 251 CVZ. The quality reel makes sense for casting distance and a good solid drag at low settings so don't cheap out here. If you fish in cold weather there is another major consideration and that is the line quide configuation. With most baitcasters the line guide on the the reel is a  moving unit with a small hole to pass the line through. It freezes up quickly in winter and inevitably leads to blown casts and birdsnests. Very hard to keep clear, in winter. The Record, C3 and C4 Abu's as well as Daiwa Millionaire CVX and CVZ and the newer Luna have a much different configuration using two parallel bars that moves along the rail of the reel. This configuration  offers a much larger pass through that is easy to keep open in freezing weather. This is a VERY desirable feature if you fish through the colder months like I do. The chap up north also does something very few anglers do anymore. He fishes with sponge not roebags. It must behave under water in a much different way than a roe bag because this guy does slay them and even though he does cover water the centerpin crowd can't reach he is still fishing a lot of the same water as the row anglers but with better results. The same can be said for using Glo Bugs at the 'geen, often works much better than roe especially in pressured situations.  When I started  I used a 13' GL2 that I had converted to baitcasting handle and guides. It was a blank listed for up to 8lbs. and in my opinion it was too long and too soft. I then had a custom rod made up from a 1263 blank from Loomis. It was rated 8-12lb. and is the most common blank used in BC for this purpose. Too me this blank is way under rated at a max of 12lb. and to me it is a rod that was too stout but exactly the right length. I eventually sold my 1263 and I spent a few years looking for a 1261 or 1262 GL3 that I could make into a baitcast rod but never found either the blank or an actual rod tied that way. A 10'6"" baitcaster rated up to 10lb line would be the ideal for here in Ontario, in my opinion. I believe ST Croix makes one in the Avid line and I see that St Croix.com is offering a Wild River 10'6"" M power in their bargain room for $80 or$90. If one was on a budget or testing the waters out this might be a rod to look at as a Wild River rod is much softer than an Avid per it's line rating. Rapala also makes a baitcast floatrod I think rated Medium and that's probably why Italo was using one on his show. I've met him too and he is a very nice chap who made a mistake about 15 years ago that the perfect types won't let go of. He know's a lot about fishing, lure modification as well as boating  and he is very willing to share his knowledge if you see him at any fishing shows (usually in the Rapala booth)  Baitcast floatfishing offers a competent caster a much superior method of getting your cast to places where even the best caster with a pin can go. You use more weight and slip type bobbers or very large set floats (Drennan Pikers and big Raven slip floats are most common but the Big Thills are good too. The best floats however are made from the handle of an aquarium net. That compressed foam handle is bright white for visibility on extra long drifts, has a big hole through the middle to allow your weight to drop the bait quickly and floats enormous weight. The handle itself is heavy so as to enhance casting. They are cheaper too.All of this is good). The other thing about casting rods over noodle set ups is that you can effectively use alternatives to roe bags and flies. I use Hot Shots, Quickfish, Spin and Glows, Blades and big jigs with a baitcaster float rod and although you could use the same gear on a pin setup the overall delicacy of a pin rig here in Ontario makes these methods less than ideal. Today when I use a float rig it's always on big water and I now use a 9'6"" rod Fenwick Techna. 10'6"" would be better  but I can still effectively fish my 9'6"" rod for floating and chucking lures without a float so the transport issue is somewhat mitigated.  For anyone interested in floating a baitcaster I would suggest a 10'6"" med light rod, a round baitcaster with the Abu/Daiwa line guide set up and big floats with lots of weight. It won't work well everywhere but it can really change up the way you fish and will produce better results some of the time in some of the locations. Feel free to contact me and I will share what I know of this fishing method"
740208,craigdritchie,2012-10-28 15:37:00,1586,"Agree with Bill. On big water, using big floats and fishing big current, long baitcasting rigs they work great. But in small streams or light currents, they're not so good. The small spool on a baitcaster doesn't turn over anywhere near as easily as the large spool on a centrepin. Fish slow runs and the difference is night and day."

740227,Musky or Specks,2012-10-28 16:59:00,2710,I ripped all my braking devices and magnets out of my baitcaster 7 ball bearing model from Quantum given to me by rep from company for said purpose. I had a custom Loomis rod made by Jon Witzke that had twist guides to take the line from the top of the rod to the bottom. Sold it here on the classifieds last year cuz I can't be bothered to steelhead fish anymore  Here a pic    I never had any problems on frogwater or small flows. Inferior to a pin yes but not by a lot.
740236,mikeseb,2012-10-28 17:25:00,201,"Why all the hate on Italo? lol  Personally hes one of my favorites and arent all fishing show guys sponsored by fishing companies?  Sure he preaches about sail and rapala like no tomorrow but Ive heard dave mercer trying to ""sell""  yamaha outboards?  Their just doing their jobs.  Italo is a great guy, very interactive with his fans he has almost every episode on youtube and if you message or comment a question he will always respond and sooner that you would think.  Only thing that I dont get is why he fishes in india so much"
740241,Christopheraaron,2012-10-28 17:37:00,3525," +1  I'm also not too sure what's up with the god bless you thing when he responds to questions, but I don't mind."
740246,kemper,2012-10-28 17:43:00,2232,"Works great - I'm looking for a blank to build on right now for a baitcast specific rig.    Huh? With the right size gear I can blast a centrepin right right across that sucker...  The Niagara is a different beast however when it comes to needing length on your casts.    Italo is a knob, not a great guy.  April 3, 1998   Two Men Fined A Total Of $1,800 For Fishing Violations Italo Labignan, 41, of Freelton, Ontario and Henry Waszczuk, 47, of Burlington, Ontario were fined a total of $1,800 today on three charges under the Ontario Fishery Regulations.  Labignan and Waszczuk pleaded guilty to a joint charge of using a hook in a manner to hook whitefish in body parts other than in the mouth. They appeared in Ontario Court (Provincial Division) in Trenton. Labignan also pleaded guilty to a charge under the regulations of failing to release a fish in a manner that caused the least harm to the fish and was fined $200. Labignan and Waszczuk are the hosts of a television show, Canadian Sportfishing.  Conservation Officers from the Ministry of Natural Resources investigated the two men's fishing activities after receiving a complaint. During the investigation, COs seized a number of video tapes. The tapes, along with other evidence, showed the two men as they were videotaped fishing for whitefish in the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995 using a fishing lure commonly called a jig. They caught a number of whitefish, and with the possible exception of one or two fish, the fish were hooked in parts of the body other than in the mouth. The whitefish were re-hooked in the mouth and then the fish were taped being brought in once again.  As part of the sentence, the court ordered them to destroy all video footage for November 6, 1995 that may be in their possession or control. Video footage already seized by the MNR was ordered forfeited.  Labignan's charge of failing to release a lake trout caught during a closed season resulted from an incident on the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995. Labignan obtained a lake trout caught by another angler, hooked it onto his own fishing line, and recorded the fish being brought in.  In addition, Karen Monaghan, 37, host of a TV show produced by Canadian Sportfishing called the Natural Angler of Toronto, was fined $800 after she pleaded guilty to a charge under the Ontario Fishery Regulations of using a hook in a manner to hook whitefish in body parts other than in the mouth.  The court was told this offence also took place at the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995, Monaghan hooked a number of whitefish in body parts other than the mouth using fishing jigs. The fish were then re-hooked in the mouth and recorded being brought in, hooked in the mouth. Monaghan was ordered to destroy all video footage for November 6, 1995 in her possession or control, and a forfeiture order was issued for the video footage already seized by MNR.  Waszczuk is scheduled to appear in Burlington court on April 6, 1998 to answer a charge of fishing in a fish sanctuary, and also in Peterborough court on April 16, 1998 to answer a charge of fishing for bass during a closed season. Both of these charges are under the Ontario Fishery Regulations.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FOR MORE INFORMATION: Brian Blomme Communications Services Branch TORONTO (416) 314-2095"

740249,kemper,2012-10-28 17:50:00,2232,"Sorry for the highjack...   As for the baitcast set-up, I think in the right situation it's perfect. I hate freezing my hand off using a pin in the dead of winter, I can't change it up and chuck hardware with my pin, etc, etc.  You need the right stick though, a 14' noodle just won't do the job correctly (unless perhaps it is spiral wrapped). I'm searching for something in the 11'6"" to 12' range with lots of meat to build on."
740250,kemper,2012-10-28 17:52:00,2232," I'm not so forgiving. That puts those two idiots in the same category as the tuna rod/treble hook crew in my books.  When you're being paid to do a job, cheating is a lousy thing to do."
