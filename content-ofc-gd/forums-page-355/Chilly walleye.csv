Headed back to LS for a final kick at the can. Was expecting a much better bite....was not to be. We got our limit of nice 17"" fish, but the bites, though aggressive, were at least half an hour apart. Marking lots on the bottom....not much moving. Water temp was still a respectable 47F at the surface, but it was blowing a blizzard and -8C on the way out and did not go above -2C all day. Cliff missed a rough grouse on the way out....lol...even they were hunkered down!        <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/N-dkx66X2Ls"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                         "

740908,Terry,2012-10-30 22:11:00,14456,"you need to build a nice warm house for your boat, then you can keep fishing till the ramp freezes up"
740918,Rod Caster,2012-10-30 22:37:00,5784,at first look I thought you had a double header on that last photo.  I'm jealous that you are much closer to ice season than I am.
740930,spincast,2012-10-30 23:23:00,3279,a half an hour between bites! bloody 'ell mate -- lucky you didn't freeze solid   Looks a wee bit chilly for sure.  Be a few months before the next bite hits my boat
741106,northernpike56,2012-10-31 15:23:00,717,nice fish!
741365,mike rousseau,2012-11-01 15:32:00,4661,This report got me thinking I need to get ready for the cold weather....  Dug out the thermal layers... Little buddy heater.... Big boots.... Water proof gloves....  I love it when it's cold enough for rods to freeze and your still getting fish while the rest are hiding at home watching people catch fish on TV...
741495,Moosebunk,2012-11-01 22:37:00,3970,"Great snowy hell mate!!!  I remember some morning scenes kinda like that.....  Brrrr.  But, at least you're not going soft and just staying home.  Fall walleye can be tricky at times, ya done good Simon!"
