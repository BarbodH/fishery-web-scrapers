Seems he dug all the used ones out of the waste basket, then he emptied out the new ones in the box.  At least he is not as bad as Peanut. She used to dig into the dirty clothes basket and chew holes through the ladies underwear."
741403,Roy,2012-11-01 18:52:00,13728,Give him a break. The poor dude has a cold.

741408,lew,2012-11-01 19:28:00,12766,"Tough to get mad at a pooch as cute as him Bruce  When my dog was a young pup and my wife and I would go out for awhile, he'd grab every shoe he could find and drag them up onto our bed.  Even now when he knows he's going out for his daily walk, he grabs all the shoes and piles them beside his food bowl.  Who knows what goes thru their minds ??   :lol:"
741410,Twocoda,2012-11-01 19:50:00,4130,It shows great character to grab a camera and show the humour to us then get pissed off ...Casey is a lucky dog! Heres an older one from last summer that we came home to...I think Paxton was trying to eat the pictures of meat off the flyers or he actually learned to read and seen the sale prices
741413,bigugli,2012-11-01 19:56:00,6138,It's not Casey's fault that Mom leaves the tissues where he can get them  . So I don't get angry with him. He is a character.
