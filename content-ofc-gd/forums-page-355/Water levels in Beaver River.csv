741180,BillM,2012-10-31 20:41:00,17367,"Fishable right now?  No, not even close."
741182,misfish,2012-10-31 20:43:00,29133,"Any trib, will be done for atleast a week. Should be prime after my return from the deer hunt."
741184,BillM,2012-10-31 20:45:00,17367," I wouldn't say all, but 99% of them...  Should be good once the water levels get back to normal."
741186,n.clarke00,2012-10-31 20:49:00,8,"I had a feeling it would be a bad time, the nottawasaga looks like it rose over a foot!!!does anyone know of a website out there that post updates about water levels in rivers?"

741222,SirCranksalot,2012-10-31 22:14:00,3291, The Notty is up at least 2 ft!
741231,DundasSteelheader,2012-10-31 23:17:00,166," I've seen the wilmot dirty up real bad and quickly wouldn't be surprised if its blown, and yeah a 13'6"" will work.."
741232,Joeytier,2012-10-31 23:31:00,3990,"If there's less than 300 hundred cars jammed along the side of the road, it's probably not fishable..."
