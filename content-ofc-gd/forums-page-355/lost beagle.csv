741019,Freshtrax,2012-10-31 03:15:00,2215,Ah man that stinks. Hope he is found quickly
741033,Christopheraaron,2012-10-31 04:14:00,3525,"Sorry no info, hope someone can find him!"
741061,Ralph Field,2012-10-31 12:46:00,1018,That is one cute dog! I hope someone finds the dog and returns it safely.
741104,NAW,2012-10-31 15:19:00,4022,"I'm assuming he got on a rabbit trail, and went for a run?  Hope they find the little guy!  I couldn't imagine what I would do if my dog go lost.  She's dumb as a stump.  Wouldn't last long out there."
741128,ch312,2012-10-31 17:37:00,1590,"i have the ""pleasure"" of owning a beagle/walker hound cross and know how stubborn they can be. i'm willing to bet he'll come back on his own as long as nobody interrupts him. there's been times when i take the dogs for a walk which ends up with me sitting and waiting for a couple hours sometimes for her to return. they seem to be very good with direction.  hopefully he comes back soon and all is well   slight hijack to help keep it up top;   does anyone use a gps tracking device on their dogs? if so, how well do they work?"
741142,mike rousseau,2012-10-31 18:45:00,4661,Check local gas stations..... I know up north if anyone finds a dog they tie it up at the nearest gas station.....
741146,Harrison,2012-10-31 18:59:00,2202,Maybe the folks who lost the dog know this already.  But friends of mine own beagles and when they ran off they would leave an few items of their clothing the area the dogs went missing.  Dogs would track back on the scent and lay on dwon an wait for the owners to return.
741149,irishfield,2012-10-31 19:06:00,26272,  Was just gonna post similar Phil... we get numerous Beagles running thru the property and all have been recoved by just leaving their blanket on the side of the road... well accept one that I netted off the pool cover!
741161,misfish,2012-10-31 19:51:00,29133,"  Exactly how I got my Short hair back. Out hunting one day,and poof,she was no where to be seen. Did like said,came back in the morning and there she was."
