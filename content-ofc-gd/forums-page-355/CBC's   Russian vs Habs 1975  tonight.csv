741980,SirCranksalot,2012-11-04 00:39:00,3291,  That's a bit like watching a Leaf game---you already know the outcome!!  Speed---I think they are a lot faster these days.  
741983,Twocoda,2012-11-04 01:04:00,4130,Anyone want to bet on the game?  (must be born after 1975 to play)
741985,chris.brock,2012-11-04 01:16:00,4053,"urghhhh, I'd still rather be watching live NHL right now, I wish they would settle, the weather's crap, the days are short, I love my Leaf games and look forward to them"
