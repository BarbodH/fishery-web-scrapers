My wife was diligent in phoning in to win tickets from The Wolf and we had the pleasure of sitting in the second row to watch these two Canadian rock bands. The Sheepdogs rocked the joint and sounded a lot like Lynyrd Skynyrd with their own twist. It was both The Wolf and Sloan's twentieth birthday party. Everything was great, but I found it wierd that The Wolf didn't throw out any t-shirts or hats to the audience."
