However, saying that, I took this weekend off fishing so i could clean the boat, lube my reels, spool up my new Toro, make leaders, sharpen hooks. silicone my line guides, grease the boat motor.  OK OK OK, so I lied, yes I'm darn excited to get out. Just sticking local though, won't get our for real fish til Thursday.  Hope we get a weekend like we did last year.     "

788622,Handlebarz,2013-05-27 00:32:00,3790,We had a great day in Windsor at the bass and musky show today getting excited about the 2013 season. I was lucky enough to meet a lot of the next generation of musky anglers they were full of questions and I was happy to answer them all.  This season is looking to be a great one just by all the good karma that is coming.  Good luck to all the musky nuts ready to get going.

I hope to be an adequate net man for him and get him on the board early. Going to fish some new watersthis year - Musky Canada Mississauga outing then going to go and meet Mike P and Crew at their outing. As always Lake of the woods is what I am working hard towards. good Luck all and look forward to your pictures.
