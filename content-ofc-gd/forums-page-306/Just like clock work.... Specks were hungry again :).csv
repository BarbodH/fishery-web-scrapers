788471,Leecher,2013-05-25 20:46:00,7832,"Some details from today.... Raymond and I hadn't wet a line in some 20 years since our last time out barbotte fishing in the Gatineau Park   He was my wife's colleague at work and good friend...  now retired and will be celebrating his 70th next week!!!  After some thoughts of, am I going fishing or not tomorrow, gave him a call to see if he was interested in some trout fishing... without hesitation, the answer was YESSSS!!!!  5h00am, look out the kitchen window and see 6C on the thermometer     Not again    Winds was blowing directly from the North.... my my my what was I thinking     WELL  turns out it was a perfect day trouting and they were hungry  We both limited out in 2h30 hours of hard work Here's a little video I made for this occasion... Enjoy  "

788496,kickingfrog,2013-05-25 23:46:00,8333,"Awesome stuff. Sometimes, with fishermen, 20 years can seem like 20 minutes."
788503,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-05-26 00:09:00,310,"Aye, laisses-en pour moi Jacques!    Great speck shore fishin' right there. Since it was so cold I guess the black flies weren't that bad? Or maybe even non-existant."
788509,Leecher,2013-05-26 00:41:00,7832," They sure are Jeremy!!!   Thanks Rob!!!  This priceless moment was long overdue... had an awesome time out there   Pas de problème W`m F... j`vais t'en laisser    The flies were non existent early morning but as soon as it warmed up a few degrees, some were coming out of hibernation... the wind played a great role in keeping them in check"
