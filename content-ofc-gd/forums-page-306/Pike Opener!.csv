788317,BillM,2013-05-24 14:03:00,17367,Nice snakes Steve!

788319,snagged,2013-05-24 14:11:00,67,"Them some monsters for sure!!! Btw, what type of leader you using?  It looks nice and thin"
788321,steverowbotham,2013-05-24 14:47:00,1800,"I tie my own leaders.  I just buy a spool of 20# coffee wire from Malin, along with some 20# crimps and tie like a mad man the night before opener lol."

788391,steverowbotham,2013-05-25 00:33:00,1800,Finally!
788395,tbayboy,2013-05-25 00:43:00,1497,"Beauties Steve, knew there was a missing pike report due here"
788397,Moosebunk,2013-05-25 00:59:00,3970,"Sadly I was primed to head north for pike this month but had to bow out when the weeks kept getting pushed back due to ""ice"" still on the lakes up north and the work schedule built up.  But this little diddy gets me primed for a couple other pike tours ahead.  Good fishing Steve.  Some beat up spawned out chunkers and some clean mean machines too.  Love the pikes."
788450,Fisherpete,2013-05-25 15:25:00,1814,Beauties Steve! I am going to get out for pike this week... hoping to get into a few like those!
