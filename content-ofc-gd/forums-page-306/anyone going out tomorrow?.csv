788456,Sinker,2013-05-25 16:58:00,8692,"Just go. Rice has been great!  I'd join you, but I plan on being out there with my son anyways.  I'm not sure how this cold and wind are going to effect the fish, but last time I was out (thurs) they were on fire!!  Husky jerks, taildancers, ans bucktail jigs all caught lots of fish.  S."
