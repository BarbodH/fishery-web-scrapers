788491,kickingfrog,2013-05-25 23:40:00,8333,Can it be done? Is it just a case of saving the info to a memory chip and transferring it? Both units only have a single spot for a chip.  Thanks for any help.
788498,Sinker,2013-05-25 23:56:00,8692,"Yep, save them to your map chip, and just swap the chip.  S."
788499,BillM,2013-05-25 23:58:00,17367,I wouldn't be saving waypoints to your Navionics/HotMaps card..  If you need to transfer use a blank card to copy them over.
788500,kickingfrog,2013-05-25 23:59:00,8333,So I'm making it harder then I need to? I thought I needed a blank SD (or mini SD) card to swap saved way points from the units hard drive.
788501,Sinker,2013-05-26 00:02:00,8692,"What's wrong with saving them on the map chip? I'm new to this, help me out here.....  S."
788505,BillM,2013-05-26 00:17:00,17367," Navionics and the rest of the companies advise you don't do this.  There is potential to render the card useless.  Then you're out $200, lol.   Exporting them to a blank SD card is really easy, as is importing them into your new unit (Should find them automatically after it boots up)..   One nice thing I like about the HB units, dual card slots.. One for the map, one for recordings, etc..  SD cards are cheap, I wouldn't take the chance."
788506,Sinker,2013-05-26 00:22:00,8692,10/4......I should really read the manual I guess. So far I only have one waypoint saved anyways lol.  S.
788515,BillM,2013-05-26 01:39:00,17367," When you save a waypoint on the unit, it saves to the unit memory, not the SD card.  The only way to get them on the SD card is to export them..  If you haven't exported them, they aren't being written to the card."
788540,jammer,2013-05-26 12:03:00,43,good info...  don't forget to turn units off before removing cards...
