788754,Rod Caster,2013-05-28 00:46:00,5784,"She's pregnant!!!     By far the longest and fattest I've ever caught. 15-16"""
788755,Rod Caster,2013-05-28 00:47:00,5784,double
788756,Christopheraaron,2013-05-28 00:56:00,3525,Nice! That's a fatty
788764,Burtess,2013-05-28 01:28:00,901,Nice!   This reminded me of a trip years ago with the kids where my middle daughter caught a prego one as well.... she was so proud to get the biggest one of the day over her sister....    Burt
788766,kickingfrog,2013-05-28 01:30:00,8333,I look like that after thanksgiving dinnerâ€¦ and it's not comfortable.
788768,Moosebunk,2013-05-28 01:33:00,3970,Look more like that everyday... Ho hum.   Phat Barbats for sure.
788782,Rod Caster,2013-05-28 02:05:00,5784,That's a real nice on Burt!! Very similar in color too. Most of the ones I've seen are much darker in complex.  Haha to the turkey dinner comment... Apparently it still had room in there for a dew worm and grub!
788784,kickingfrog,2013-05-28 02:11:00,8333,There's always room for dessert.
788786,Joeytier,2013-05-28 02:19:00,3990,Shoulda done him a favor and poked his pooper!  and/or done a little fattening of your own with some fresh catfish...
788805,adolson,2013-05-28 06:10:00,783,"Eww.. cut the line, or shake the rod until the hook dislodges."
788814,Rich,2013-05-28 09:31:00,3927,Yeah they are rough on the manicure I usually get before fishing.
788832,Rod Caster,2013-05-28 12:33:00,5784,"I ain't pokin' no poopers Joey hahaha. If the whities ever show up, I'll be doing lots of fattening up of my own.  Dana, just think of it as a triple-spined, wide-mouthed, whiskered and rubbery trout...it's easy if you try  One the other hand Rich, the slime acts as a good moisturizer!"
788900,Leecher,2013-05-28 17:40:00,7832,That's not a bullhead... it's a submarine    Active and hungry fat barbotte
