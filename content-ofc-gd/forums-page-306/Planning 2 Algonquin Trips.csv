The only lake I've fished was Burnt Island Lake last year (caught some smallies, perch and one single brookie. Also had a musky crash my buzzbait... Destroyed it completely)  For the July trip I plan on going to Tom Thomson Lake and in August - Big Porcupine. I've been to both lakes but never fished them. I remember some sexy spots on the way to these lakes but I havent scoped out the lake themselves.  If anyone here has fished them before, I'm accepting pointers.  Pretty sure I know what Im bringing with me, but any suggestions would be lovely also.  I get skunked 45 mins from home, not trying to get skunked all the way out there. I will drown my sorrows in room temperature brews.   Thanks Brohams    "

Since you are going in August it may be a bit more challenging, you will have to get down deep for Lakers. Troll with a 3 way swivel and some good weight.  Be sure to try Coon, Bonnechere, Phipps and McGarvey, all are easy day trips from BP."

I almost didnt want to tell that story and be ""that guy"" lol. Burnt Island isnt supposed to have brooks either but... I got one.  I've been reading abour Bonnechere. Seems like the fishing out there is better the BP. I'm going to give it a shot"
