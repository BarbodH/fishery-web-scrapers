787584,gordy28,2013-05-20 23:10:00,638,If you use the search function you will find some reports from Brennan Harbour -including our groups from last september For us bottom bouncers (at least 2ounces) with harnesses were the ticket for walleye Would definitely recommend paying for the guide at least for 1 day and 1 boat. He's a good guy and a good guide and will show you the best spots and techniques for that time of year/that week as he guides all year long for the lodge and on his own Cheers Gordy 
787592,paul sr.,2013-05-20 23:40:00,10,thanks for that.yes I have searched the topic. I noticed all the trips discussed were either in early spring or September. I got a little nervous that we weren't going the right time of year. the idea of a guide makes good sense.
787661,gordy28,2013-05-21 11:06:00,638,"I think you will be fine in July A few thoughts: It can get rough quick. But there is a big bay to your right as you come out of the Bay the harbour is in- we caught pike, walleye and bass in there and it's not a bad run if it's rough Most if not all of the spots marked for fish from the lodge produced for us. We had other spots but those were a good place to start Good luck but I think you will enjoy it Gotdy"
