785723,jimmer,2013-05-10 19:59:00,2730,"Like someone said, all freshwater fish have some form of parasite in them that's why we can't eat them raw. Cook them and everything is good, or let them go so someone else can catch the fish. I used to line the tape worms up as a kid when I was cleaning walleye years ago to find the largest one. That was on Scugog."

Since I was stuck in the fish hut waiting for the extreme thunderstorm to slow a bit before heading back to the cabin, I took extra time to check the fillets out.  They looked nice and clean to me, mine are goin in the frying pan :-)"
788568,gaspumper,2013-05-26 17:26:00,393,Tape worms do not get in the fillets they are in the intestines only.

Do not throw the tapeworms to the eagles... they taste good in a Caesar salad.  And finally... a true story.. I knew a professor of biology at Nipissing University in North Bay.. who grew his own tapeworm... (in his guts) as an experiment...  I think when he flushed it out it was some 10 feet long... Now how cool is that....?

I read that the actual tape worm is in the intestine but the eggs are in the flesh... So as long as you fully cook you fish... No worries...  And if you must see this worm picture...

I would look that up if I was you and just make sure what it is ?? Or if affects the meat ....did u take pics of it

785071,Dabluz,2013-05-08 01:15:00,701,"For the guys who think that parasites in fish is rare....they are simply just stupid.  All fish have some form of parasite.  Even the fish in un-fished northern waters.  Some worms are tiny and live on the fins and gills, other worms are very large and long.  Some worms are in a dormant state and you see them as black spots on the skin.  They got there after travelling through the flesh from the intestine on their way to the skin.  Worms in the flesh are very rare.  Yes, saltwater fish often have worms in the flesh and they are very easy to spot.  I fish for cod and halibut and every time I have a fillet in my hands, I put it up to the light and let the light shine through the fillet in order to check if there are any worms in the meat.  The fish fillets are always visually checked by passing them over a white translucent counter top with a strong light source under the counter.  However, there are many worms and a lot get past the inspection.  I check all of my fish fillets by putting them up to the light and I have never come across any worms in the flesh of freshwater fish.  No worms can survive the cooking process so there is no danger.  Raw fish.....I wouldn't trust any raw fish that I did not catch and clean myself.  I have caught a few fish that did not have any noticeable worms in the intestines but these fish were young brook trout caught in streams.  Larger, older fish seem to have more parasites.  I guess this is normal because they have been exposed for a longer period of time and the parasites have also had the time to increase in size and numbers over time.  Tapeworms coming out of the anus of a walleye, or pike, or trout or bass or any other fish is normal.  The host (walleye) is dead and the tapeworms can no longer feed so they are just abandoning ship."
785074,Dabluz,2013-05-08 01:20:00,701," I hope you quit fishing and take up the sport of golfing.  Golf balls don't have worms.  You can eat as many as you want.  Guys like you should take the time to learn more about fish, their life cycle, their parasites, their management etc."
785075,Dabluz,2013-05-08 01:23:00,701,"  I guess you have been working there for only a few days because if you closely inspect the intestines and stomach content of walleye, almost all walleye have some sort of worm infection."

586544,umKthxbye,2011-05-25 17:08:00,247,"Just cook it fully. You'll know if you got a tapeworm in you. It will eat any protein B(i think it's that) then you will get sick and go into the hospital. It will never get to 30 feet inside a human unless the human has no sense of pain cuz it will be painful as hell. There is actually an episode of House MD that touches on tape worms, good episode. It's really your call though. I don't like eating fish all that much so I wouldn't eat it but if it's cooked well it will just get burned to death and disintegrate into oblivion."
586545,jimmer,2011-05-25 17:17:00,2730,"The tape worm is in the stomach. Most walleye have them and not many anglers realize that they are there when cleaning. Do not throw them out. First it is illegal and second you are wasting good fish. I have seen this many times over my life and it can't hurt you. At least it never hurt me, that I know of. LOL If it's the white grub in the meat, just pick them out and forget about it."

I don't keep that many fish but when I do run into a tapeworm, I'll fillet the fish and put it in a separate bag marked ""TW"" and take it to the fourth neighbour down.

586579,Live2fish85,2011-05-25 19:00:00,1633,"One thing I can say is don't go by anything you see on a T.V. show. And as for the walleye just eat it. Tape worms stay in the intestines therefore the meat is still good I have seen them in the odd Erie Walleye, I still eat them and never have got sick from them. The meat is cooked therefore killing anything in the meat. It's not as if your eating it everyday. You can't imagine whats wrong with the things you eat lol. Lots of times when I worked in the butcher shop we would get cows with cancer. It was pretty nasty and we would clean it off and the meat and cut it and on the counter it goes I have had it and it tastes a bit off to. So just eat it don't waste it."

Your eating the meat not the guts. The yellow grub or Tumors would be my worry. Plus you can pick the grubs out. Cod is full of worms and we eat Cod. Tilapia   is another poop story."
594323,pics,2011-06-19 13:01:00,1268,Your're right on Dave...Worry more about what is in Tilapia and Basa than walleye....most of the time you can see the white and black grubs when you land the fish...There are probably more tapeworms around then people realize...we just don't open the bellies often enough to see them......(sometimes you just have to see what they're eating...)
594325,mike rousseau,2011-06-19 13:07:00,4661,The black and yellow worms are not tape worms... These were 5 inches long...  And read the eggs are in the meat
