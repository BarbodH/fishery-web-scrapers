787223,Leecher,2013-05-17 18:50:00,7832,For those interested and not knowing... made a little video of how it's done  
787270,limeyangler,2013-05-18 01:31:00,5204,Great video...neat way to do it....kinda reminds me of how i clean a musky
787274,Moosebunk,2013-05-18 02:02:00,3970,Clean house and clean fish Jacques.  Quick and easy for ya.  My girls used to like seeing 'em cook with the heads on though... so most times I'd keep 'em happy.  Spring fishing is going well for ya it looks like.
787302,Leecher,2013-05-18 15:09:00,7832, Thanks Simon!!!  Simple and fast     Musky????? LOL   Thanks Drew!!!  Spring fishing for me was not great until yesterday... glad they got hungry... loved the 15 minute workout I got
787640,Dabluz,2013-05-21 02:56:00,701,Don't you remove the blood along the spine?
787728,ch312,2013-05-21 17:20:00,1590, that's easily done with your thumbnail when rinsing the fish.   i learned this technique during one of our trips to newfoundland after fishing multiple small pools with 4x8 ft areas that were literally black with specks. talk about good eats
787797,Leecher,2013-05-21 22:09:00,7832," I sure do, running my thumb along the spine... was just showing how easy it is to get them cleaned    Didn't include the last bit...   ch312     Good eats... they sure are"
