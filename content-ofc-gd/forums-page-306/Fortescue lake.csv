788633,Sinker,2013-05-27 01:57:00,8692,I think it has musky too.  S.
788634,Rizzo,2013-05-27 02:02:00,4754,Would musky be open there as well starting this week-end? Maybe a later start?
788644,Sinker,2013-05-27 03:37:00,8692,"Yep, june 1st.  S."
788645,Squid,2013-05-27 03:47:00,1656,Good luck launching I hear there is not much of a launch.
788671,danada,2013-05-27 14:07:00,31,"Taking a tin boat and small motor. Not too worried about launching, just curious to find what i will be fishing for."
788676,Joeytier,2013-05-27 14:19:00,3990,"It is a stocked, year round lake trout lake.  Beyond that, I dont know much other than its very deep for its size"
788677,jimmer,2013-05-27 14:21:00,2730,A very interesting lake. Very clear and deep water.
788681,danada,2013-05-27 15:10:00,31,Thanks for the replies.
788715,Sinker,2013-05-27 20:47:00,8692,"There's a splake lake at one end of it you can hike into for a few casts. I've caught them in there before, but many years ago. Surprisingly decent numbers of musky in there.  S."
