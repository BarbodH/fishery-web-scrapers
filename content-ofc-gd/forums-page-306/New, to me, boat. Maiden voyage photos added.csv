788387,Roy,2013-05-25 00:07:00,13728,So how did it go? Are you happy with it? Any tweaks you want to do?
788388,kickingfrog,2013-05-25 00:19:00,8333,"I forgot how much of a pain it is to troll from a console.  I only had a few hours before picking up the kids from daycare. Things went so smooth I kept expecting to have the motor fall off on the highway home. I'm used to my hummingbird so there is a bit of a learning curve with the lowrance, but no big deal. I hope to go fishing next week and that's where I'll start to get a sense for any tweaks."
788389,Sinker,2013-05-25 00:29:00,8692,Uh oh.......skunked on the first outing is a bad sign!  Glad to hear it went smooth otherwise.  I fully understand the whole trolling/console thing.   S.
788517,Rizzo,2013-05-26 02:09:00,4754,...looks great Rob! Glad you got out and that all went well. A real nice look with your tow vehicle.
788519,Rizzo,2013-05-26 02:12:00,4754,"my 3 year old son (who should be in bed) just peered over my shoulder while I was looking at your photos and said ""hhheeeyyyyyy that guy is fishing in OUR boat"" (and now he's bugging me to scroll back to the picture)"
788520,kickingfrog,2013-05-26 02:14:00,8333,"Ya, you gotta watch what's one the screen when the little ones are around."
788524,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-26 02:31:00,10439,There are a couple of options when it comes to preventing stone chips. The flaps are OK but do nothing when stones are thrown from vehicles passing you.  The Bow buddy attaches to the front of the trailer to protect the hull from stones. http://www.trailer-rockguard.com/  If you travel a lot of gravel roads the Trailer Tux is the one to have. http://www.trailertux.com/  I want to add one to my trailer and I think the Tux is the one I will go with. They aren't cheap but neither is a paint job.  Almost forgot to mention that they are both Canadian companies.
788583,motv8tr,2013-05-26 20:44:00,2587,"Nice!!!  Congratulations Rob, I know you'll enjoy that...  Maureen"
785868,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 14:30:00,8333,"That's funny.  I'd love a dedicated fishing boat with a tiller, but since 2 boats are out of the question this was the route for meâ€¦ for now. And he included the bowmount in the deal.  The list is getting longer every day."
785958,HTHM,2013-05-12 04:16:00,4082,"Well it is time for this again....      http://www.youtube.com/embed/d2gIdMRwfuM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>"
785959,Joey,2013-05-12 04:33:00,9122,
785963,Roy,2013-05-12 09:02:00,13728,"Congrats to you Rob, that's a great boat! I have basically the same boat except mine's a tiller. I put a 60hp 4 stroke on mine and that thing'll scoot! I have the identical trailer but I can't believe how good yours looks compared to mine. Mine's all pitted from stone chips. Here's what mine looks like...in fact I'm sure you took this picture one morning on Nipissing.   "
785964,fishindevil,2013-05-12 10:00:00,6254,Nice rig !!!! They were sooooo popular they sold a ton of them during those years and just as many are still on the water !!!! Treat her well keep all the service up to date and she will be around for a long time !!!!! Cheers.
785966,Handlebarz,2013-05-12 10:49:00,3790,Nice looking new ride just in time for the great weather
785967,aplumma,2013-05-12 11:14:00,6896,Well done a nice boat score for sure.   Art
785973,Rizzo,2013-05-12 12:12:00,4754,"I had the same issue Roy, but every couple of years I would sand down the areas that had the chips and then repaint those spots."
785980,lew,2013-05-12 12:35:00,12766,I ordered this mud flap from from Cabellas last year and it does a great job of keeping the stones off the boat & trailer. Hooks onto the hitch and is very simple to attach and remove from the truck.    
785981,woodenboater,2013-05-12 12:38:00,2277,"geezus Lew, how deep is your garage ??? would kill to have one that big in the city"
785983,lew,2013-05-12 12:48:00,12766, 50' and plenty big for all the toys  I spend more time in the garage than the house  
785984,davey buoy,2013-05-12 12:51:00,5505,I can see why!!What a nice set up!
785993,woodenboater,2013-05-12 13:19:00,2277,"If there's a fridge and wifi, my wife would never see me again until dinner time lol"
786011,mr blizzard,2013-05-12 14:52:00,1589,"Kickingfrogs boat, Lews garage and HTHMs video,,,,,what a package that would be lol. congrats on the boat."
786014,JJW,2013-05-12 15:08:00,6,"Great looking boat, would look even better with a planer board mast flying in the wind."
786052,kickingfrog,2013-05-12 17:26:00,8333,Love the room in yours Roy. Maybe that's where I fell in love? Roger sure looks after his stuff.
787264,Wolf 3,2013-05-18 00:55:00,134,Very nice. Congrats!
787267,danc,2013-05-18 01:08:00,4677, First thing I did when I ordered my boat was upgrade to a galvanized trailer. Still like new 12 years later.
787350,kickingfrog,2013-05-19 00:52:00,8333, Really makes a difference eh? I'll keep that in mind if/when I go new in a few years. Unless rizzo is willing to sand and repaint it for me every couple of years.
787374,Rizzo,2013-05-19 12:10:00,4754,haha good luck with that. I think the boat was getting lower to the ground...the last time I did it my belly seemed to be a lot closer to the hull as I was lying on my back under the boat.
787376,kickingfrog,2013-05-19 12:35:00,8333,Unfortunately I think that is likely to continue.
787525,kickingfrog,2013-05-20 19:25:00,8333,Tow vehicle is finally set-up... and the forecast is for thunderstorms for the next 3 days.  Watching the weather more closely then a farmer for the next couple of days.
787538,muskymatt,2013-05-20 20:17:00,2608,sweet! should be some great pics taken in that boat now
788266,mercman,2013-05-24 01:47:00,7054,Ya can NOT go wrong with a Princecraft Rob. Congrats and get it slimed soon
788386,kickingfrog,2013-05-24 23:53:00,8333,Finally got out in the boat today. Just a quick tour and I was too preoccupied to take more photos. Although I should have had my brother take a few of the boat running but that will have to be for next time.    
785764,kickingfrog,2013-05-10 23:38:00,8333,"Before:   After:     You may remember a month or so ago Rizzo was asking about boat/motor combos and features. I asked him about his current boat and he sent me some photos. A few weeks later, the new boat is bought, he needs to make room in the garage and puts his old boat up for sale. A few PMs and some emails and a deal is struck.  The list of things to do in the new house is still long but maybe I'll get her wet by the long weekend."
785765,misfish,2013-05-10 23:39:00,29133,"Ah,so yer the guy.LOL  Nice grab Rob."
785766,Cudz,2013-05-10 23:41:00,2652,Nice looking boat Rob!!! If I see you out I will come by and say hi
785767,danc,2013-05-10 23:43:00,4677,Looking good Rob.
785768,davey buoy,2013-05-10 23:44:00,5505,"Very nice!!!,congrats!"
785773,irishfield,2013-05-11 00:07:00,26272,Just like New.. Roger never used the thing!!
785777,cynmar,2013-05-11 00:42:00,169,I AM JEALOUS
785778,Dan668,2013-05-11 00:43:00,1120,Awesome.
785782,Rizzo,2013-05-11 00:55:00,4754,"...dude...can I have it back? It is a bit sad seeing it go, but then I picked up my new alummacraft and suddenly felt a lot better! I hope you enjoy it Rob, it was a pleasure meeting you."
785783,pidge,2013-05-11 00:55:00,438,Thats what Id get. Thats a great lookin boat right there Kickinfrog.
785785,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 01:00:00,8333,It sure looks like the livewell never saw a fish.
785786,irishfield,2013-05-11 01:06:00,26272, Not that I ever heard about !
785789,woodenboater,2013-05-11 01:14:00,2277,"nice new water ride. btw, move that Weber kettle a bit and you gain a couple of feet for boat storage"
785790,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 01:15:00,8333, And meeting you. I wanta see some photos of the new rig (I'm sure I'm not the only one). Who knows maybe in a few years when you get the 2 footitis we can deal again.
785793,Moosebunk,2013-05-11 01:22:00,3970,Great rig Rob. You're going to enjoy that.  What are the boat specs?  Motor HP and such?
785801,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 02:19:00,8243,"That rig sure makes your garage much nicer. You know the old saying about the 2 happiest days of a boat owner, it's Bull. Enjoy. I remember when I got my new rig after going without for 20 years, I would get up to take a, well you know what, and had to flip the light switch on and look outside and say "" that's mine "". I still do, wife says come to bed honey, it will be there in the morning, I promise."
785802,Radnine,2013-05-11 02:24:00,1538,"A  few too many rivets for my liking, but hey, if it floats your boat... Well done and congratulations to you!!!! Jim"
785803,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 02:24:00,8333,16 ft Princecraft pro series. It's maxed out at 50hp with a Johnson 4stroke.  Here are a couple of photos Rizzo sent me:    
785805,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 02:32:00,8243,"A Johnson, oh no, tell me it's not so. I didn't notice the Johnson. Sell the boat, now. Don't wait until the morning, sell it now!!!! Every time I see a Johnson the cowl is off.  That's OK don't panic, you can always upgrade to a Merc someday. Enjoy. It's Friday night and this vodka sure tastes fine!"
785815,bow slayer,2013-05-11 03:04:00,1074,"actually not a johnson...that is a 4 stroke so it is a suzuki,no need for him to downgrade to a merc You will love the motor ,i have a 70 4 stroke johnson(suzuki) and has been a dream to own."
785826,SlowPoke,2013-05-11 04:02:00,2984,Those Jozuki's are great... I'm still looking for a 15 longshaft electric. Nice boat Rob. You might need a Q7 to pull it though
785830,Sinker,2013-05-11 04:09:00,8692,"Congrats Rob. Not a bad rig, but the tiller model of that boat is much nicer  Did Rizzo keep the bowmount? Your gonna have to go shopping asap!  S."
785841,Rizzo,2013-05-11 08:14:00,4754,"...you're nuts. That their engine is the best I've ever had out of the 6 outboards I've owned in my life...and 2 of those have been mercs! Like someone else said, it is actually a Suzuki. Would not have changed it for the world."
785842,lew,2013-05-11 08:23:00,12766,"Congrats on the new ride Rob, you got a good one.    "
785848,spincast,2013-05-11 10:27:00,3279,nice toy - congrats. Those  Bass Pro flyers will start to take on a whole new level of meaning.
