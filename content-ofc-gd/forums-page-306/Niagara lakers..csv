788573,Ainsley,2013-05-26 19:14:00,142,"After not getting out fishing much over the winter I've had the chance to fish the lower Niagara at the glen three times over the past few weeks.  These were some of my best days I've had for lake trout, the first I went 7/7, then 2/3 with the biggest laker I've caught.  Today was the most recent, I went 3/3. Here are the highlight pictures:     This was the biggest.  Fought for a good 20 min and I ended up running 3-400 ft down the shore to keep up with it "
788574,Raf,2013-05-26 19:34:00,3495,beauty laker

788580,BillM,2013-05-26 20:23:00,17367,"Love big lakers, that last one is a cow!"
788582,Ainsley,2013-05-26 20:40:00,142,All but one were caught on a kwikfish on a 3 way rig with a 3/4oz pencil weight.  The last one today was caught on a streamer I tied. Pretty much any minnow imitator will work.

789362,Ainsley,2013-05-30 16:04:00,142,"Thanks everyone.  It was a blast catching those down there. I was using my calcutta 100dc on a st. Croix 9'6"" wild river rod. 12lb floro mainline and 10lb leader. The 7 fish day I was by myself which makes landing them quite tricky."
