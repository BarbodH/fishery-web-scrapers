788856,BucktownAngler,2013-05-28 15:22:00,582,"what is the best/your fav dropshot hooks and why?  anybody find the vmc spinshot hooks any better or worse then a regular hook & swivel?   also, and preference over ball shaped weights vs long cylindrical shaped weights?"
788857,Ainsley,2013-05-28 15:25:00,142,I like the gamakatsu split/drop shot hooks. I use a swivel above it to reduce line twist.
788860,oldphart,2013-05-28 15:31:00,665,"~~~~  Gamakatsu Red hooks a must for me, and in heavy rocky areas I like to use Long Flatten out Sinker, which I hammar out myself"
788861,bigreddog,2013-05-28 15:36:00,84," x2.  Those and the Owner Down Shot Offset hooks are excellent.  I have no experience with the VMC spinshots, but I would probably want to try the Gamakatsu version first (one less knot).  As for weight shape, it depends on the terrain.  For very rocky terrain with lots of crevices, cylindrical weights work better for me because they will snag a little less."
788878,BillM,2013-05-28 16:34:00,17367,VMC spinshot hooks worked great for me last year.  No complaints.
788892,JoshS,2013-05-28 17:11:00,729,"They all work but I think I like the owner hooks over the gammys, they seem thinner gauge and are super strong. I haven't bought a pack in well over a year so times may have changed."
788916,wkimwes,2013-05-28 19:14:00,76,"I usually use the Gamakatsu drop shot hooks, never really used a swivel, just use the standard palomar and with a clip pencil weight at the bottom.  I did get two of those VMC spinshot hooks to try out when I received my May 2013 Mystery Tackle Box subscription.  Will have to try them out.  (I guess maybe I don't have that much line twist problem, because I use a Baitcaster for my drop shots..I used a MH/XF Cumara 6'8"" - with a Curado 50E, loaded with 8lb floroclear.)"

788930,Lape0019,2013-05-28 20:46:00,647,I use the spinshots almost exclusively. I like them and haven't  missed any fish yet. I don't like the amount of tying involved though. I rigged up two with a sinker for perch a few weeks back and they worked extremely well.  Adam
788931,adempsey,2013-05-28 20:49:00,1498,I also like Owner hooks.  I picked up ome TTI-Blakemore Standout Hooks that I thought were kinda cool.   Haven't had the chance to try them yet though.

788989,jedimaster,2013-05-29 00:35:00,3472,I do a lot of drop shotting and i am not a fan of the spin shots at all. I prefer to use a mustad octopus hook. The vmc hooks I find are heavy and add extra bulk. I don't really have much of a problem with line twist. I use braid and a floor leader.
789055,fishindevil,2013-05-29 07:27:00,6254,Yes I use braid as well and a flouro leader too !!! But I don't mind trying a new product so if they work great that's good if not oh well I still have all my other back ups as well !!!! I thought maybe in the strong current of the Ottawa river it might help a bit .... So that's yet to be determined
789075,Live2fish85,2013-05-29 11:44:00,1633,"I dropshot a ton out on Erie. The majority of the time I am dropshotting, the VMC hooks are awesome. I haven't had any problems or complaints at all."
789092,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 13:40:00,3970,Prefer the SpinShot VMC's over Gammys by a mile.  No experience with the Owners.
789098,DropShot'r,2013-05-29 14:19:00,62,For finesse applications I prefer Gamakatsu Splitshot/Dropshot hooks and Gamakatsu Wide Gap Finesse hooks. I have heard good things about VMC Spin Shot hooks. For most finesse presentations I use the cylindrical weights. I purchased a Do-it mold and pour my own weights.  Dropshotting isn't always about a finesse presentation. It is a bait delivery system that can be used anywhere.    Drop
789101,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 14:26:00,3970,"No one is more enthusiastic about the drop than you Steve.  But hey man, it totally works for you everytime... as has been noted often."
789114,grimsbylander,2013-05-29 15:08:00,3016,"I use the VMC Spinshot hooks for three reasons. First, much less line twist than tying direct with a palomar knot. Second, snags are inevitable and retying takes time so I use a 2 or 4 lb drop line. Using a less than half the weight drop line below your main line means only breaking off below your hook. Saves baits and hooks too. And remember you dont need to tie a good knot on the drop line. Tie something like a clinch with two wraps only. Third, the gammy version of the Spinshot is stupid expensive."
789115,aero_ball,2013-05-29 15:12:00,19,Owner 1/0 Mosquito hooks for me. Liked the needle point hook point as well as the relatively thick wire hook in case I need to get the bait and fish out of structure quickly.  Owner 2/0 Down Shot is my second choice. Sharp cutting point hook point with minimal effort to set the hook. Not as strong fishing around thicker vegetation though.  I always use a paloma knot and fish a cylindrical sinker 95% of the time. The sinker shape give me good bottom contact and is relatively snag-free the way I work the drop-shot.
789249,RJackson,2013-05-30 01:35:00,113,"Owner 2/0 Downshot for me.  Light wire with great penetration.  Don't use braid with em, you'll open em up.  Just a steady sweep and they stick every time.  RJ"
