I have 2 x 7.5Ah Batteries that ususally only last about 7hrs. each.  If I could figure out how to turn off the GPS, I'm sure they would last longer, as there is no hydro at the camp we are going to, to recharge. My unit is the HDS5 Lake Insight version.  I have looked through all menu's, and can't seem to figure it out.  Any help is appreciated."
