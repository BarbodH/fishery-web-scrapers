I had an hour to spare before night shift so we had a short family fishing session on the lawn. Jack has a new rod and 'taco' box (thats how he pronounces 'tackle', he does his best to mimic my accent....lol). The walleye we are catching are spawned out males.....still waiting for the big pike to make an appearance. Supper tomorrow night is looking good!     "
