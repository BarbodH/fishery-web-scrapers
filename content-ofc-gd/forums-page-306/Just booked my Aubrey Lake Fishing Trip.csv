A few friends and I will be camping about a mile from the lake. I have never been fishing there as all of my prior trips have been around Nipigon. Does anyone have any tips for fishing the lake, or at least some past experiences of fishing there? We want to target pike and walleye, and will also be trying to fish for some smallmouth bass. Also, I wouldn't mind trailering over to a different lake if it means better fishing. I just need to be able to tow in my 16ft Alumacraft fisherman and launch it with a truck. Thanks in advance, any knowledge or tips you guys have will help a ton and will be greatly appreciated as I know nothing about this lake."
