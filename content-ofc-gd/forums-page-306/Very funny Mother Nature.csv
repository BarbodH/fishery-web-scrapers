788610,danc,2013-05-26 23:31:00,4677,"I'll try to put up more of a report later, but here's what I encountered at my preferred boat launch this weekend. It's almost June Mother Nature! Helloooo???  "
788611,spincast,2013-05-26 23:34:00,3279,"beauty scenery - but yeah, it is definitley one confused spring this year, aint it?"
788612,Lape0019,2013-05-26 23:35:00,647,"Man,  I haven't seen any of that stuff for over a month here. I would not have been happy."
788613,Terry,2013-05-26 23:38:00,14456,Mother Nature is just protecting her brook trout .....lol
788614,lew,2013-05-26 23:40:00,12766,We had wet snow here a couple days ago Dan but nuthin like you've got up your way....thankfully
788615,Spiel,2013-05-26 23:44:00,9065, It's been far too long since I stood in that spot and enjoyed the view Dan.  Maybe this year.
788618,Rizzo,2013-05-26 23:54:00,4754,wow that sucks
788619,kickingfrog,2013-05-27 00:10:00,8333,I think you and I have a different sense of humour Dan.
788624,Handlebarz,2013-05-27 00:34:00,3790,"At least you had winter we have not had enough safe ice on the Thames river to get out in three seasons. My daughter is not impressed I would like to get out but 2-3"" of uneven ice is not good for me."
788630,Joey,2013-05-27 01:51:00,9122,"Yes, she's a fickle bit............  Nevermind, I feel your pain!"
788635,BillM,2013-05-27 02:02:00,17367,No dock I bet as well eh Dan? LOL!!!!   That's insane!   Let's hope it warms up for August  :)  Did you end up checking out the launch at Pine Portage?
788638,danc,2013-05-27 02:22:00,4677,"Launched at Portage Bill. Put over 40 miles on the boat without a sniff all day. We were dodging icebergs all day and never found water warmer than 36f. Had some fun in the lower river sections though. I walked into a place where a creek enters the system and caught 6 Specks in half an hour from shore. They're in there after the smelts, which are still spawning up here. And we got some Steel and a few more Brookies in the lower section. Not the best weekend, but still had some fun and found a few fish."
788641,Moosebunk,2013-05-27 03:17:00,3970,Poor guy.  Six plus specks and some steel.  That does make a cool pic Dan.  Too bad it didn't go quite as planned but I bet you enjoyed the w/e nonetheless.
788658,Harrison,2013-05-27 12:13:00,2202,Great shot Dan! That's the stuff of a beer commercial.
788660,ccmtcanada,2013-05-27 12:31:00,7971,Yikes!!!  That's just brutal!  Glad you found a place to launch though.  Looking forward to your report...always love the pictures you take!!
788666,4x4bassin,2013-05-27 13:40:00,1025,"Wow , yes mother nature has been a fickle lady this year !"
788847,fishnsled,2013-05-28 14:47:00,3520,"That would drive me crazy at this time of the year.  I was upset when we launched the first weekend in April and saw a skim of ice at the launch.  At least you got out and found a few fish, can't ask for much more than that given the conditions. Hope that ice is gone soon for ya Dan."
788944,camillj,2013-05-28 22:13:00,1988,Blah Blah Blah ... whine whine whine .(or should I say wine wine wine)... where's the speck pics ... my monster this weekend was 1lb 12 oz .... probably BAIT for your coasters   Still waiting for my invite btw
