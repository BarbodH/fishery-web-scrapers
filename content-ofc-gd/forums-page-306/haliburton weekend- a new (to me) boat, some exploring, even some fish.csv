789328,Sinker,2013-05-30 13:47:00,8692,"Great weekend. My kids are bugging for a pontoon boat, but I just can't do it......yet. They are comfy rigs, and quite versatile too. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  S."
789335,wkimwes,2013-05-30 14:01:00,76,"Nice boat, it is something we are looking at getting next year, but we are trying to figure out if it's worth it to get.  I may have to follow up with you next year."
789336,chris.brock,2013-05-30 14:03:00,4053," that's your exact, favourite lure! it caught the laker, I caught the walleye on a white twister tail though  it seems like a decent lake, the drive is a little far though, are you going to get there this summer?"
789339,chris.brock,2013-05-30 14:05:00,4053," it's slow with the 25 hp, 20 kph, but super comfy, I think we're going to enjoy it, follow up later if you like"
