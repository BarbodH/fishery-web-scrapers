But it did have 2 air chambers on the sides that were still fine, so we carefully cut them off and set them aside since it looked like it could be useful.  So this spring I remembered about them, I went out, bought a lawn chair, carried it on my back a couple kilometres from canadian tire, drilled some holes, cut the legs, filed the edges and strapped the pontoons on. Just took it for a test ride in the pool and it handles well and it very comfortable  Brian and Terry don't have nothin on me! LOL  "
