Jack is getting more confident in his fishing skills and absolutely beat me hands down last night at a local pond. He insisted on small weights and floating jigs, not my egg sinker and large floating jig, and thats exactly what the fishes wanted....lol...i changed up pretty quick to his rig.  He rarely turns down the opportunity to fish and has been bugging to get out in the boat......even been helping me prep the boat thias year...sanding bench seats etc...etc.  The fish are scarce at the moment from shore, late ice out and other things playing a role there....but we have had fresh walleye for supper a couple times now this week, no complaints there!     Here's some pics and video of yesterdays fishing.                                                                      JACK TOOK THESE PICTURES....NOT BAD EH?                    "

788464,spincast,2013-05-25 18:36:00,3279,great stuff Simon.Jack sure is growing up fast! Nothing like being out fished by your boy - not sure who smiles bigger each time G does it to me - but he definitely smiles longer
788493,Joey,2013-05-25 23:42:00,9122,Wonderful pics and video.  Jack is becoming a great fisherman and photographer!!!  I see a bright future

788534,bigugli,2013-05-26 09:45:00,6138,"My son does not clean my clock too often, but he does have his days. As for cleaning fish, he hands em off and asks for fries and a side of slaw to go with em"
788536,Roy,2013-05-26 10:04:00,13728,"You got yourself a regular little coureur des bois there, Simon. Just add moccasins and a muzzle loader and he's ready to rock!  Thanks for sharing."
788546,Rod Caster,2013-05-26 12:36:00,5784,Your boy knows exactly where his food comes from... very cool and important. Good job Simon.
