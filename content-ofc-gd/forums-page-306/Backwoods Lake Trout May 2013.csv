So many sights , sounds and smells in the bush come springtime I just love being out there ! As well all the planning/dreaming over the last couple months have finally come together . Our travel day started early from our meeting place in Barrie without a glitch and we all headed north 3 hours to our little parking lot in the bush trailering our atv's and gear . The trail into the lake was some what dry but the usual rock crawling is always the challenge especially on the way in with our quads completely loaded to the max . We keep our boats at the lake cached away so no trailering boats  (once was enough) The trip on the trail is a long , slow ride with us covering 12km of trail in a little over an hour . Once at the lake it was time to setup tents and tarps as well cut a mess of wood , then we enjoyed a couple laughs about our journey in over some rums  This would be my home for a couple days , nothing like waterfront real estate in the middle of nowhere    We started the next day ""fairly"" early . This lake is a great jigging lake but once I turned on the lowrance I found out that the water was only 51 degrees I knew that the trout would be scattered and in the top 20 feet so we started trolling the shallow areas around the deep basins . The fish were active for our whole trip and trolling was the ticket in the morning and evening with jigging being the way to go come the afternoon .  Here are a couple fish pictures I took , didn't take too many because these guys are really hard to hang on to for a picture .        The lake trout in this particular lake do not grow very big (mostly bug eaters) but they sure make up for it with there fight . The average size on our trip was around 3-4lbs . We always have one fish fry on a trip and these guys are good cooked in some butter over a fire with some lemon  This laker was the chosen one    Just before hitting the pan    The trip was a great one with good times and great fishing had by all . The blackflies were some what non existent which was a real plus as well . The lures of choice for me was a 1oz white bucktail jig and a silver/red Williams with a fly streamer trailering it attached by a 12"" piece of flouro. The other guys had good luck with a silver/copper Sutton spoon trolled. Best depths for trolling seemed to be 25-35' and getting on and off the throttle a bit seemed to be the ticket . Jigging depths of 40-60' worked well but trolling was the way to go this weekend . Jigging will be better once the water warms up and they gather in the basins , just in time for my next trip !  Here are my setups for the weekend      I have to mention Christopher K of our OFC family for making me my lake trout streamers , they were top quality and looked great as well they caught fish . On the last morning I caught all my lakers on CK's streamers . I think my friends will be ordering some for next spring . If anyone is intrested in getting some flies/streamers I would not hesitate in recommending Christopher for the task . Thanks again CK  Here is a picture of the flies CK made me minus one that I lost on a nice laker    Hope you enjoyed and I will be going back to this spot in the summer for some deep water lake trout and smallies Cheers Dave"
788094,Rod Caster,2013-05-23 01:20:00,5784,Now that is a good spring trip! Good call stashing a boat..sure makes it easier doesn't it? The flesh on those fish looks amazing!  I can vouch for CK making good quality stuff. I ordered some marabou jigs and they really look like quality gear. Now I need to try them in the water asap.
788104,Joeytier,2013-05-23 01:42:00,3990,Great stuff.  Interesting that you keep the hook on your spoon for trolling with a snell...ill have to go that a go
