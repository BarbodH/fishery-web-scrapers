788661,Billy - Curtiss,2013-05-27 12:34:00,241,It's been a good long while since I have perused these forums. I have rekindled my passion for fishing. Playing music has eaten up most of my time but I'm stoked for spring piking in the metropolis. And north when I can escape! Hope to see some old friends. Cheers folks!
