787874,millerman,2013-05-22 00:53:00,29,hi everyone i just wanted to know where and when is the best time and place to catch silver bass i have caught one while bottom fishing at pc and it has to be shore cause i do not own a boat yet and also what would be the best thing to use for  them thx u in advance 
787922,hotsky,2013-05-22 03:56:00,400,I've caught a number of them last year on small spoons and spinners. Worm would work too if you're into lazy fishing
787943,bigugli,2013-05-22 10:57:00,6138,"Time is now at mouths of tribs, or even upstream."
787945,Rich,2013-05-22 11:10:00,3927,"Anything flashy and fast seems to work. Agressive little buggers.  I like a small little cleo, blue/silver."
788231,Burtess,2013-05-23 21:44:00,901,"I have good luck in the rivers with a 1/16 to 1/8oz jig + a 2"" white curlytail.  Also #2 spinners with a bit of worm on the treble.  Burt"
788247,Handlebarz,2013-05-23 23:48:00,3790,White twister tail has always worked great for them or small meps style spinner baits rooster tails and panther martins were my favorite
788329,ehg,2013-05-24 15:06:00,2666," Yup, the next month (June) the white bass will be near mouth of Lake Ontario tribs. I remember as a kid catching jumbo perch, sunfish and white bass during last few weeks of school at creek mouth. Little Panther Martin spinners are good."
788402,Pickeral eater,2013-05-25 01:34:00,155,"Upper Niagara has good fishing for silver bass and good sized perch from shore around Nichols Marine.  Scoop your minnows from shore and fish away.  Most guys use pickeral rigs and 1/2 ounce bell sinkers, myself included.  Had great luck there"
788443,BillM,2013-05-25 14:02:00,17367,"We used to slam them in front of the lighthouse in St.Catharines when I was a kid.   Little Cleos, etc... Anything you could cast super far..    Great fish to target with the kids, they are ferocious and if you've found one, you've found a 1000, lol.  Also right below the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie as well..   Love silver bass."
