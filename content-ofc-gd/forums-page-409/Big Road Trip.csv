695401,danbouck,2012-05-12 01:51:00,4380,"So I just landed a contract for work that is sending me to Moosonee in a few weeks with about 10 stops in between. I will be staying in Cochrane a couple nights, Moosonee for 1 night and if things work out Temagami for one night.  Basically what I'm looking for is the best place to stay in Moosonee for the night and something to do for the morning after (preferably fishing or a cruise of some sort). I know there are only a couple places to stay but I haven't heard great things about any of them  I'm also hoping to find a spot near Cochrane to catch some fish.  I'm hoping that Temagami works out. I think I know a guy who can help me with that one   Feel free to PM me  Thanks, Dan"
