695962,Rod Caster,2012-05-13 23:13:00,5784,"I couldn't find definitive answers on their website or elsewhere.  What is the difference between the A, B and C type handles on Shimano spinning rods (Crucial specifically)?? If I'm correct, the C-Style handle comes with the ""finger hook"" that is typically on a casting rod?"
695978,rmarentette,2012-05-14 00:00:00,124,"Tackle Warehouse site shows the spinning rods and according to their information the A handle is 11-1/2 "" B handle is 12"" and C handle is 12-1/2""  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Shimano_Crucial_Spinning_Rods/descpage-SCRS.html  You can also check there for bait cast rods as well."
695987,Rod Caster,2012-05-14 00:21:00,5784,"  Thanks, I've never been to that site...great info. The site I'm looking at has the incorrect photo and I believe it is showing the Crucial Casting model. I'm mostly unfamilliar with Shimano rods so I'm having trust issues with some of the information on the web.  The site I'm looking at must be offering last years model, since it's quoting an IM-9 blank. The one at tacklewarehouse is quoting an IM-10."
696009,Rod Caster,2012-05-14 00:55:00,5784,"Yup, they posted the wrong photo. The handle types (A,B,C) only refers to length (thanks Rolly). The spinning rod does not have the finger hook (or whatever it's called).  They posted one of these models as a Spinning Rod. I'm gonna call them tomorrow to see if it's last years model... they are on sale for almost 50%  "
696171,Rod Caster,2012-05-14 15:02:00,5784,"Now that I've placed my order... check this sale out.  http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/shimano/home/fishing/fresh-saltwater-fishing/spinning-rods/c0-c20-c201-c20102-b100673-p1.html  Shimano Crucials Spinning(last years discontinued model) is on sale from $154 down to 89.

696278,rmarentette,2012-05-14 21:45:00,124,Wow! Great price. How much for shipping?
696284,Rod Caster,2012-05-14 21:50:00,5784,"  $10 I think...it's fair and it comes from Winnipeg. They are just adding it to a back-order I placed a few weeks ago. Soon I get : canoe rod holder, sweet life jacket, yoke pad and a new rod."
