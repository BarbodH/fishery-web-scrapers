It truly wa awesome to see in the right light conditions and weather conditions. After witnessing it, I promised to show the kiddos, but weather wouldn't co-operate. But after some fishing today in harsh winds, It looked like the winds would die and conditions were favorable to witness these amazing creatures in the act.  We headed down after a phone call from Limeyangler where we spouted off about trout, lol. Always good talking to ya dood!  Upon arrival, the light was perfect for a mere moment, so I got busy with the camera. I shot a few short videos and took a few pics.  The kids were astounded by these beautiful fish. So violent in the current, yet so subtle and elegant. It lasted all of ten minutes, but the kids will have it etched in their minds for a long time to come.  The Rainy River Sturgeon!!!!

695451,manitoubass2,2012-05-12 05:37:00,11391," The top two are video! Not the best, but cool.  The water levels are holding, the river will clear up. I'll try my darndness to get some good clean pics/video in the next few days  "

695466,Christopheraaron,2012-05-12 09:34:00,3525,"Awesome! I was scrolling down and saw you were holding some thing and almost had a heart attack thinking it was a sturgeon, luckily it was too pink to be a sturgeon."

695557,kickingfrog,2012-05-12 15:06:00,8333,That's as close fish porn as I've seen here. Very tastefully done.
695563,manitoubass2,2012-05-12 15:26:00,11391," Thanks KF, glad you enjoyed it!  I have one more video where the kids are hollering at the sturgeon in an attempt at getting them to jump, lol, but it's taking forever to upload. I'll post it up a little later so you can see two fish rise to clean their gills   "
695625,fish_fishburn,2012-05-12 20:42:00,1311,"Awesome, thanks for that."
695664,manitoubass2,2012-05-12 22:47:00,11391,"Sorry guys, no more vids today. Water is way too blown out from high winds"
695678,manitoubass2,2012-05-13 00:08:00,11391,"Finally got the last video from last night to upload.  2 fish cleaning their gills. I told the kids if they told the fish to jump, they would. The sturgeon were real champs about it and gave us two water breaks.  Enjoy!!!  "
695681,Live2fish85,2012-05-13 00:26:00,1633,Great video man. Nice family shot you got to.  Thanks for sharing.
695764,manitoubass2,2012-05-13 04:46:00,11391, Thanks dood! And my pleasure!!!!   
695768,Twocoda,2012-05-13 04:56:00,4130,Quality time with the bambinos...Thanks for taking the time for us too Cheers
695885,Leecher,2012-05-13 18:58:00,7832,This just blows my mind that you have all this happening in your own back yard     Man you are one lucky dude Rainy River sure has a great fishery to be discovered Thanks for sharing the videos Manitou... loved them
695905,manitoubass2,2012-05-13 20:18:00,11391," Glad you enjoyed them!  If everyone crosses their fingers, the weather will co-operate the next few days and the sturgeon will still be spawning, so I can capture on film what I witness about 5 days ago.  It's an unreal site to see thousands of them in shallow water, doing there thing! From 14"" to what looks like some that would surely measure 90"".  I'll keep trying for the members here, cause I know not everyone gets to witness such an incredible sight...   "
695907,limeyangler,2012-05-13 20:25:00,5204,Good stuff Rick...absolutely amazing to watch. I remember seeing those things jump when i was fishing with you that time....big beasts!  Good looking family!
