695307,bucktail,2012-05-11 17:26:00,1857,Thinkng of going to Erie out of Chrystal Beach this weekend for perch. I have only been there once before so any help on locations for some good perch and some bait would be really appreciated. Also wondering when the walleye start out there. I went last year and had a really good day but that was July Thanks  Darren
695326,Grimace,2012-05-11 18:37:00,2020,I sent you a PM with all you should need to know.  Good luck.   Hope it helps get you started.   After you come off the water hit up the Portuguese chicken place by the Tim Horton's. Great chicken.
