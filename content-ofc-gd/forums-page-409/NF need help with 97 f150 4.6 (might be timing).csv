I parked it at a creek to fih when I was ready to leave it backfired. ever since it runs like its out of time popping and snaping. i had my neighbor over with his scan tool it gave no real codes to help I have swapped out coil packs and also the mass air sensor with no change looking for pointers or ideas  I would check the timing chain but it looks lke alot of work anyone have a simple way to check it  could really use some ideas need to drive to work in morn
