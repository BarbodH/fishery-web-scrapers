We were making a big fuss over our own mothers that I never noticed that my wife was being unusually quiet...I was informed why later...  All I could think of saying was...""But you are not my mother""...which made things even worse...  So guys...You got time...go get sumpin' even if it is only a card..."
695533,Grimace,2012-05-12 14:00:00,2020,Hopefully the gas station hasn't run out of flowers.   :-)
695538,crappieperchhunter,2012-05-12 14:15:00,2582,Come on Beansie...you know I treat Debbe like a queen 364 days a years  Sundays for my mom.  So far I haven't had to sleep in the garage or out in the car Sunday night
695542,crappieperchhunter,2012-05-12 14:25:00,2582,  LOL...thx for that Grimace. At an intersection by our house there is always a broken down van with the back doors open and some raggedy looking person selling flowers on mothers day.  I made a remark to Debbe one day while passing by. I asked her if flowers from there would show her  how much I truly loved her.  Her comment was if you get flowers from THERE make sure you sanitize them first
