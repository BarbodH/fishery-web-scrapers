We only had worms so we had to fight to keep the sunfish and bluegill off (although some were very decent). I went out early Sunday morning (after I found some old Berkley 3"" minnows in the bottom of the tackle box and got two more. Then he and I went again in the afternoon and picked up  a few more keepers with a few throw backs. All in all a great time and a new experience for me targeting crappie. Oh! and might I add Delicious!!!!    "
