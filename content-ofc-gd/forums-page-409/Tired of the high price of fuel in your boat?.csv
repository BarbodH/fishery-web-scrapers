695336,Bernie,2012-05-11 20:12:00,3190,"A week ago I spotted something across the yard. I went over to have a look. Wow! Haven't seen anything like this one. The guys over at the boat shop have been working on something that I'd like to see in action when it's completed. A fellow had the guys build him a boat to install a steam engine into. They constructed the hull, then the fellow installed the steam engine. Now it's back to have the seats, floor and some details made to complete it.            When you stop for a shore lunch just pick up a little bit of driftwood and away you go again...."
695337,Terry,2012-05-11 20:14:00,14456,now that is cool
695338,davey buoy,2012-05-11 20:16:00,5505,"That's a great idea,but throwing another log on the fire to me is better left for home.Lol.:thumbsup_anim:Make sure you keep us up to date!!"
695340,Headhunter,2012-05-11 20:25:00,5703,That's pretty cool Bernie! Hopefully it'll still be around in a couple of weeks... I believe that we are stopping by the shop on the way up. Uhmm... where would they get the water for the steam? HH
695342,mercman,2012-05-11 20:32:00,7054,"Boiler is nice Bernie, but the boat is SPECTACULAR !!!!  "
695343,NAW,2012-05-11 20:35:00,4022,"That's cool.  If you have a chance, post some pics of the completed project.  I'd love to see that!"
695344,jedimaster,2012-05-11 20:44:00,3472,I guess if you run out of wood on the lake you could always cut a piece off the deck...Pretty cool
695345,Terry,2012-05-11 20:45:00,14456,but it would run for ever on Lake of the Woods
695353,fishnsled,2012-05-11 21:29:00,3520," Hope it's there is a couple of weeks as well, would be great to check it out.    "
695372,kickingfrog,2012-05-11 22:36:00,8333,Didn't the Little Rascals use a boat like that?
695376,bigugli,2012-05-11 23:27:00,6138,I can imagine the tickets the vessel operator will need to posess. Steam propulsion is not as simple as some would have you believe.
695390,Muskieman,2012-05-12 00:54:00,2472,Now.... THAT IS COOL !!!
695419,Mike the Pike,2012-05-12 02:20:00,3421,Thats a great idea.THe boyz are on to something.  MTP

695540,Beans,2012-05-12 14:17:00,3339,"Great way to camouflage a ""still""..."
695636,wallyboss,2012-05-12 21:22:00,1095,And the smoke will keep the bugs away.
