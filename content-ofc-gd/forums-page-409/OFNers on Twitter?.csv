680753,Grimace,2012-03-28 00:10:00,2020,Twitter is good for sports.  I find I have to get rid of most of the professional fishing crowd as all they do is shill incessantly.   I have kept the good ones like Shirley and a few others.

I guess they were trolling LOL  I only go on it once in a while now, I find it kinda hard to say anything in 140 characters.  @elhreporter"
651733,206,2011-12-30 01:02:00,563, Danm...I musta signed up for the wrong twitter? Or i'm just not as good looking as you grt
651825,Toccobender,2011-12-30 06:27:00,10,I just started the twitter thing and don't really get it at all lol. @toccobender
651852,Mike Pike,2011-12-30 13:55:00,1332,"Never thought about Twitter as an angling tool Boss.  Might be a reason for me to sign up.  I've just always seen it as a marketing / selling tool.  Everyone who tweets typically has an agenda of somekind, whether it's to promote themselves or their products or companies.  I'm not a huge fan right now."
651857,Harrison,2011-12-30 14:04:00,2202," Your right, there is alot of businesses and promotion on Twitter but once you do create an account, you can choose who you follow therefore controling what content you view.  It is actually a great tool for anglers.  @eTackle_ca"
651861,Roy,2011-12-30 14:14:00,13728,"I've never liked (no pun intended) any of the so called social networks. But I guess when your goal is to get as many followers as you can, it has some marketing worth. I keep getting a mental image of sitting in a boat with fishing Bud saying ""Hey I got 23 likes today, how many did you get?"" Kinda makes me puke just a little."
651871,BucktownAngler,2011-12-30 15:05:00,582, already following you  getting first notification of the sales
651873,BucktownAngler,2011-12-30 15:08:00,582," either did i, but once i realized this ive been addicted. A lot of the pros are on there, and post news, tips, and articles. As well as businesses, who show new products and sales, etc.  And of course fellow anglers, who share fishing catches, tips, stories, etc."

651896,Harrison,2011-12-30 16:35:00,2202, I think the folks that would talk like that would be more likely to be trolling behind a computer then on the water.
