This is what I found out so far: Boat is welded Monark is a part of Starcraft Monark makes Legend welded hulls they use 0.100 gauge aluminum  I also see that they stopped making boats out of the Monark brand and have launced a new brand name under Starweld, I suppose they are the same boats?  any info will be appreciated  Long"
