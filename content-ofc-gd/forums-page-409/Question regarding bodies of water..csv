For example, I'm looking on google maps and see a million small lakes by muskoka, but are all these fishable?  Do all these little lakes have streams that water can flow in and out of?  If a lake has no in-flow or out-flow stream into a larger body of water, will it still contain fish? Or will it be dead water?  And about dams. If a river has a dam, with no fish ladder. Will there still be fish beyond the dam?  I've fished for many species of fish before and really want to try for brook trouts up north, which is why I'm looking to explore new waters.  I love the feeling of being out on a lake or river/stream with nothing else around you. Just you, your fishing gears, and the beautiful environment.  Any input will be greatly appreciated.. Thanks.    Regards,  Dan"

Try fishing them and see what you find.  MNR stocking lists may lead you to a few trout lakes. But nothing is going to replace getting out there and fishing them."
