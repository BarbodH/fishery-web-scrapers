695432,TDunn,2012-05-12 03:07:00,680,"Hey OFC!  Its been a busy spring for me. Sorry for the lapse in reports!  Anyway, our spring like most other places was odd to say the least. My last trip on the ice was somewhere in Lake Superior Provincial Park. It was a horrible day spent basically gathering wood to stay warm.      9 days later in the St. Marys rapids        12 days later on Superior             March was hands down the best month for steel up north. We were greeted with fantastic numbers at almost all our spots.                nothing like 2 cold ones after a solid evening of steel   Soon the mouths slowed and I moved up river                  This was Teds first full spring using a pin......ya he's addicted....  Ted Hooking A Steelie    I was invited to fish some private property on a stretch of river. It was probably the tightest fishing Ive done with the pin in a few years and it really isn't my cup of tea but I have to admit was fun pulling steel from the brush piles. We walked a few km of rivers and found the fish stacked in two deep holes that were littered with wood.  My buddy ended up getting to try his new smoker    We snuck out for walleyes twice before the season closed here. Its not to often we get to slide our boats in and fish the mouth of a few rivers but this year the entire lake was ice free before closer.....Amazing...  Anyways the numbers for fish in the 16-20"" range was great.    I had the lucky stick on the first evening hitting these two nice ones  25""   28.5""     Ted did the second outing. A nice one coming just short of 27""     It had probablky been 3 maybe 4 weeks before I hit the St. Marys again but it was on fire when I did. Fished the rapids 3 days in a row with 2 buds and we lit them up. Bouncing roe took most fish for us  Some of the better fish/shots                      Bonus lakers          My last 2 trips to the rapids had fish involved but it wasn't as hot for me as it had been....  Its only about 3 weeks away until my trip to Lake Nipigon! Giant everything is the target! I'm looking for info on the lake. PM's would be appreciated!!  Then I'm guiding walleye for 2 weeks. The day I get back from that job, I head south to a OKFS event. Bring on the bass.... Somewhere between these trips, I'll sneak in a report!  Take care everyone,  TDunn"
695434,Rod Caster,2012-05-12 03:12:00,5784,"Awsome as usual. You seem to catch as many steelhead as I catch perch. That 28"" walleye was a beauty!!"
695438,irishfield,2012-05-12 03:30:00,26272,THANKS Tyler!!! Will keep my forum blood flowing until I return in October!!!!
695460,Jet,2012-05-12 08:56:00,364,That was absolutely awesome. The variety of fishing is what it is all about.  I grew up in Nipigon. You'll enjoy that water regardless of the action.
695484,highdrifter,2012-05-12 11:30:00,2534,"Good work budday!  I'm gonna have to milk you for info later...  And by all means, if you can join Mike and I next week, you gotta do it.  cheers HD"
