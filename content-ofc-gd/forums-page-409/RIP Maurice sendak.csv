Maurice Sendak was a children's writer however prided himself on showing young ones more serious things in life and was utterly disgusted by today's ""princess"" books that sugarcoated kids. Though not the most conventional children's author kids and adults loved his work and all took meaning from his books. He was the author and illustrator of books such as ""Where the wild things are"", and ""in the night kitchen"". RIP Maurice Sendak.
