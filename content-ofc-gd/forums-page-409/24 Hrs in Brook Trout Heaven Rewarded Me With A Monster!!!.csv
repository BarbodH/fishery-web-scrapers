695812,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-05-13 14:08:00,310,"Ever since the first day that I met my buddy Bass over 8 years ago, he's been telling me that we need to go fish in a certain neck of the woods where there are legends of snapped lines due to 6-8 pound brookies. Yeah, o.k, is what I'd tell him, I'll believe it when I see it.   After Bass' buddy (who had the towing vehicle and a 14 foot boat) cancelled on us last minute, we threw my 12' tinny in the back of Bass' cargo van and headed north to big brookie territory.   Nothing was going to stop us from arriving at our destination, even rough, narrow, almost washed out quad roads weren't enough to deter us.   We were on the water at 6am and eager to slay some giants.   Once it was all said and done, we boated a dozen brookies and nothing was under 2 pounds. Most of them were between 16-18 inches with one 19.5'', one 20'' and one giant 23 incher.   Bass started things out with a nice 18.5'' speck.   Check out this football. The first 3 brookies that Bass hooked into had another jealous trout following up to the surface. At one point, I didn't know which fish to net.   After a couple of lost fish, I finally got into some action.   Here's Bass with his biggest of this heavenly trip, a sweet 20'' brookie.   The evening bite was nothing short of spectacular. After this one was released, I had no idea what was coming up next...   After a long and stressful fight, I finally had her in my hands: 23 inches in length, 15 inches in girth = 6 pounds of beauty. A personal best brookie that is easily the most impressive trout I have ever caught.   For over 20 years now, I've been hiking mountains and walking through thick bush to find remote lakes in the hopes of catching that elusive trophy brook trout. I can now proudly say that the search is over and I finally found what I was looking for... the fish of my life. "
