695601,saspirilli,2012-05-12 17:35:00,27,"Hello to all,  Was hoping for some advice as we are looking to purchase a fishfinder as a gift for a friend who has just purchased his first cottage and a new 14foot tinny with a 9.9hp motor for tooling around his lake.  We'd like to stay under the $150.00 price point and simplicity of use is a priority - as mentioned, this will be installed on a very low-tech boat.  We picked up a Humminbird 550 that is currently on sale at Canadian Tire as a back-up - http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443281565&bmUID=1336843833211 - but are willing to return for another unit if another style is recommended.  Also noticed the PirahnaMax series:  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/FishFinders/PRDOVR~0793911P/PiranhaMax+160+Fish+Finder.jsp?locale=en  And the clamp-on style like: http://www.basspro.com/Humminbird-110-Fishin-Buddy-Ultimate-Portable-Fishfinder/product/97460/102949  None of us have ever installed or used these units, so would very much appreciate the advice of the experienced.  Thanks so much."
695685,Woodsman,2012-05-13 00:40:00,1286,The 550 should be good. In the PirahnaMax  series go with the 170 or higher. The 550 is better though with a bigger screen.
695759,saspirilli,2012-05-13 04:15:00,27,Thanks Woodsman - hope the installation isn't too hard for a rookie boat-owner.  Appreciate the feedback.
695760,Jet,2012-05-13 04:32:00,364,"I'd stick with the 550, much better unit than the PirahnaMax. I recommend getting the portable kit and a portable transducer mount. Then you can take it in and out of the boat as needed and use it for ice fishing and other boats. I use it this way all the time all season long.  http://store.humminbird.com/products/322967/PTC_U_NB  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp12/tite_lok.pdf"
695772,Woodsman,2012-05-13 09:39:00,1286,Installation is rather easy & explained in the manual. The problem with the portable kit for use on a boat is the suction cup mount for the transducer tends to pop off if you are running at speed from spot to spot. Removing the transducer from the back of the boat when running at faster speeds solves this but you now lose the use of the unit for depth. For the transducer mount linked to above you can almost buy a second transducer. Mount your transducer to the boat as in the instructions & buy a icefishing transducer if you plan on using it on the ice.
695847,saspirilli,2012-05-13 16:23:00,27,"Thanks again for all of the feedback. Sounds like the consensus is that the 550 on sale is a much better unit than the other options in the price range.  I doubt that my friend will be ice-fishing or using the unit on another boat, so I think the hard mounting will be the preferred/best option."
