Just got off the phone with him, and he says that he would like to grab some live bait (minnows) on the way there.  I haven't a clue as to where we can do this.... any helpful suggestions?  Thanks."

696051,Dave Bailey,2012-05-14 02:38:00,1641, You're really asking for it by posting a thread with that title around these clowns! I think they let you off lightly this time.
696146,bigbuck,2012-05-14 14:14:00,2449,BJ Tackle is right in Bewdley beside the boat launch. Good luck on Rice.
696173,Harrison,2012-05-14 15:07:00,2202,"I have to send a shout out to Ben everytime I can.  When I held my Big Brothers & Sisters fish days Ben let me use his property for BBQ and awards.  The township was giving me a hard time for permits, he heard about these events and stepped in.  You'd be hard pressed to get a better pulse on what going on with Rice Lake then at BJ Tackle in Bewdley."
696262,thatleetboy,2012-05-14 21:04:00,143,"Thanks for the helpful advice... a  great place to deal with. He told us where to fish, what to use, and we just kept reeling in pickerel....  Thanks guys!"
