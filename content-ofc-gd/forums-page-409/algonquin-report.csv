We decided to do an easy one this year, only 5 short poratges into Algonquin and a couple 10+ klm paddles. We were in on a Friday and out on the Sunday. Beautiful weather, fish were bitting and they sure tasted great. We got a bunch (10?) of Brook trout around 15-17"" and 1 lake trout that was a bit bigger. We feasted on Brook trout after the first full day of fishing. I've never kept 4 fish in a whole trip before, this day we kept 4 for one meal.It was fantastic! Awesome time as usual.    "
