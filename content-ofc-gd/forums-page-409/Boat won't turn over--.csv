692265,fisher,2012-05-02 19:13:00,451,"okay, so i lined up an appointment with Top Gun Marine for this Saturday...they were very nice to agree to have me drop off my boat this weekend...hopefully they turn it around quickly as i,d like to get out soon.  thanks again for everyones help and advice."
692267,fisher,2012-05-02 19:13:00,451,oops double post
692304,esoxansteel,2012-05-02 20:05:00,1307,Is the kill switch tether strap hooked up or did you remove it last fall?
692332,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-02 21:26:00,10439,  He and Tybo figured out the problem (cracked stator assembly) so now he just needs to get the repairs done.
692366,monsterfish,2012-05-02 23:06:00,48,"Hey Tybo!  Good on ya, that was a great move!  You deserve many fish filled outings this season!"
692401,Bernie,2012-05-03 00:48:00,3190,In direct injected outboards the spark plugs do need to be indexed. The electrode interferes with the fuel flow and creates an area of no fuel at the gap which creates a misfire.
696236,fisher,2012-05-14 19:03:00,451,"A huge thanks to Paul at Top Gun Marine!  What a great guy. It was worth the extra drive to bring it there. He got my boat fixed in less than  a week - and that is saying a lot since this is May!  I am sure it helped that Tybo diagnosed the issue for me - bad stator.  (Thanks again Tybo!)  Regardless, the quick turnaround was greatly appreciated!"
696252,Flappn,2012-05-14 20:33:00,245,"There is a place in King City called ""Discount Marine"" (on keele just south of king vaughaun townline) who friends of mine have used and always been happy with their service."
691141,fisher,2012-04-29 12:10:00,451,"The annual spring ritual of hoping my boat starts after the winter is upon me and this year, it won't.  It cranks but just won't start.  So, now of course that is all I have been consumed with since yesterday and now I have given up and need to hand it over to the pros.  Has anyone used BassPro mechanical services?  Do you drive up an drop off, or do you need an appointment?  I am waiting until 10am to give them a call but thought I would ask here first."
691142,Roy,2012-04-29 12:14:00,13728,It doesn't sound like something that needs professional service. What make/year outboard is it? Did it run smoothly last season? Sounds like either a fuel or spark issue.
691144,Nipfisher,2012-04-29 12:17:00,2449,Is it electronic choke or manual choke?
691145,fisher,2012-04-29 12:22:00,451,"Hi Roy, it ran great until I winterized it last fall.  So, yesterday after a few hours of not being able to get it to start, I decided to change the spark plugs.  A minute later, it fired right up and I let it run afor a few minutes and thought great, it worked.  But then when I shut it off and took off the plugs to see if they were dirty (which they really were not, I put them back in).  It hasn't started again since.  i fiddled with the plugs on and off but still nothing.  Could it be I put them in too tight or too loose?"
691146,fisher,2012-04-29 12:24:00,451,"It is a 1992 merc 40 hp, manual choke, just above the electronic ket starter (sorry I am not mechanically versed).  The choke is a lever that is above the key.  Some other notes: I hear a click when I push the key in to start, so I know that works (I think it is the enricher).  The fuel is new, I ran stabilizer and fogged the engine last fall).  The ball is hard when I pump it on the fuel line."
691147,Roy,2012-04-29 12:25:00,13728,"You changed the plugs, it started and ran fine then decided to look at the plugs to see if they were dirty?"
691149,fisher,2012-04-29 12:28:00,451,"yah, i know. I looked at them to see if they were blacked up with oil and stuff...I know, wish I left them.  Regardless, I put them back in and now it does not work...that shouldn't happen."
691152,skeeter,2012-04-29 12:45:00,1907,Did you switch the plug wires by mistake?
691154,fisher,2012-04-29 12:49:00,451,"i thought about the plugs too, but no...it is 1, 2 3, 4 firing order and wires were the same order.  thanks"
691156,bushart,2012-04-29 12:51:00,2628,Couple checks  Fuelfilter??--they're cheap and need replacing regularily  You changed plugs  Have you been burning reg-unleaded ethanol added gas?  2 yrs ago I had a similiar prob---that rubber deterioriates with ethanol---little chunk in one carb--getting sucked in??  Just a thought---did you use fuel treatment??
691161,fisher,2012-04-29 13:09:00,451,"fuel filter and stabilizer all done. always premium gas at esso, shell or petro canada - all ehgtanol free Basspro here i come."
691164,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-29 13:20:00,10439,  Actually that lever is the fast idle. To choke it push in the key and it will send a shot of fuel into the cylinders.
691171,fisher,2012-04-29 13:42:00,451,Thanks Drifter...I do push the key in and I hear a click and a squirt of fuel..so that's not it.
691174,SlowPoke,2012-04-29 13:57:00,2984,$3.00 might save you $100 in diagnostics http://www.princessauto.com/pal/product/8003334/Electrical-Repair/In-Line-Spark-Plug-Tester  Check kill switch if applicable. Check your tilt also. Some engines won't start if tilted too high.
691181,wallyboss,2012-04-29 14:40:00,1095," Unless you keep pushing it in, you could be flooding it."
691190,ecmilley,2012-04-29 15:17:00,2163,"check your kill switch, common enough issue when they sit. where you located there are much better service centres than bps, if anything try top gun marine only another 30 min north and you get a real expert to look at the boat. if your near lindsay i would look at it for free for an OFC a 40 hp isn't to bad to work on, though it does sound like you flooded it, have you tried cranking it over with the choke off anf wot to clear it"
691191,Tybo,2012-04-29 15:17:00,1373,"Fisher,If you are close to Richmond Hill I got time to take a look."
691197,fisher,2012-04-29 15:35:00,451," Hi Tybo, I am actually 5 minutes from BassPro in Woodbridge.   Do you have a number I can reach you at?  PM me if you prefer. Thanks,Frank I pm'd you my number."
691290,fisher,2012-04-29 23:46:00,451,"Just wanted to thank Tybo for his help today.  While we didn't get the boat started, he did diagnose a bad/cracked stator (spelling?).  Anyway, I plan to call Top Gun Marine tomorrow to see when I could bring it up for them to repair it.  Thanks to everyone for their input and especially Tybo for taking the time to help out a fellow member."
691293,Scott S,2012-04-29 23:59:00,203,That's awesome. Good job Tybo
691295,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-30 00:04:00,10439,Ouch!!! That sucks!!! At least you found the problem. Could be a little spendy to repair though. Here's hoping for the best.
691338,rdambros,2012-04-30 02:31:00,71,"I have heard that some engines require that the plugs are lined up in a certain direction for the engine to fire. In other words, the electrode has to be pointed in a certain direction. I would think that the engine would have to be marked at the plugs with an arrow, then it would be a matter of marking the plugs so that they line up in the right direction. Just a suggestion, that based on the facts might be the cause.  Check your owner's manual or download one from the manufacturer's website."
691342,marrex_mike,2012-04-30 03:14:00,40,You could also try Central Outboard Marine in Markham..they aren't to far from Woodbridge and I have brought my boat there for a while and so have friends of mine..
691358,whiskywizard,2012-04-30 10:23:00,305, Be really careful taking any advice from the the guy who told you this....
691367,bigbuck,2012-04-30 11:54:00,2449,"That sort of thing is for F1 racing engines. Lining up plugs!! Ha!! Tybo, good on you bud!!! Get'r running and the fish await."
