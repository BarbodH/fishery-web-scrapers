117961,tkeyla67,2007-09-27 00:08:00,5,"Help, I've riped out all my old wiring and have started to replace it with marine grade wiring.  I installed a new fuse/rocker illuminated 6 switch panel on the dash, made the connections for my new fishfinder, VHF radio, bielge pump and running lights.  I tested the running lights and nothing. I ran a cable from the battery to the panel, (positive battery to the positive terminal on the panel and same thing for the negative) new wire from the white light and red/green light, spliced them together and connected to the panel,(positive wires to the ""pigtail"" on the panel and negative wires to the negative terminal on the panel).  When I connected the battery, the illuminated switch on the panel lit up.  When I flipped the switch, nothing happened.  I know the lights work because I touched the wires directly to the battery terminals and they came on.  What am I doing wrong?  Any help or advice would be much appriciated.  Thank you."
