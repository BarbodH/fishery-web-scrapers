Fishing was a little slow but I managed to get a couple of small bass.I decided to wade out to try a different spot and glad I did as I landed this one.My biggest bass of the year.   The boys had no luck and manged to catch zero.All well,there is always tomorrow.The moon came out early so I thought I would take a pic.  Tyler was determined to catch something with his new reel and stayed out until dark but it was not meant to be tonight.Here is a pic of someone looking like he is ready to go home.  I will assume Tyler will want to try again tomorrow so hopefully he has better luck."

117560,tbayboy,2007-09-25 23:37:00,1497,I'm trying to picture tylers face of a nice big carp hat hit right after that 1/2 asleep pic .  I'm sure he's dying to break in the new reel.
117669,Mike Pike,2007-09-26 03:38:00,1332,"Love the reports Fatherof3!  Hey, you're gonna have to give your kids a quick lesson on using the camera so you can get yourself in the pics with a nice liplock on Mr. Bass.  Keep the river in the background and you'll have yourself a nice collection of pics to remember your outings by.  You guys are ending up with a lot of fish on the end of your lines!  And I agree with Johnny Bass; your kids are lucky to have a Dad who takes 'em out fishing so often!  Bet they'll remember these times as fondly as you will.  Cheers!"
117671,sharper,2007-09-26 03:43:00,279,Your so lucky to be able fish almost everyday! Nice spot you got there.
117690,fatherof3,2007-09-26 10:29:00,1769,"thanks everyone,as long as they keep asking to go I will keep taking them."
