104552,tinbanger,2007-08-17 11:51:00,1028,"Some more  - plan to have at least 1/3 more fuel than you think you will need. - ensure all required safety gear is on board AND WORKS (ie flashlight , fire ext) add some basic tools - trailer lights work ,see 2 or 3 every week on the highway with no working lights - Our rule is big motor on , PFDs on .Rough water PFDs on .Fishing alone PFDs on -invest in a floater suit for early and late season fishing - cell or Marine radio for the bigger lakes  Good post  TB"

104914,Greencoachdog,2007-08-18 11:05:00,8163,1.Never try to help me land a fish by grabbing my Sabiki Rig!!!  2. Wearing a Lindy glove will save wear and tear on your hands when handling toothy fish.  3. Always have the throwable PFD within plain view and easy reach.
105783,tonyb,2007-08-21 14:38:00,1637,"Always wear some form of eye protection when fishing.  Sunglasses, clear safety glasses at night, etc.  It will save you from a trip to the hospital and this! Oh nevermind the picture is too gross to put up, but I think you folks have seen it before...  Protect your eyes!  Tony"
105791,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 15:03:00,7971,"When fishing in the winter from shore (Tribs or piers) or on hardwater, pick up a set of these to put on your boots to help with traction on icy surfaces....  "
106259,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-22 19:12:00,835,Drop your anchor.  When you loose control of the boat due to break down or as the young  fellas the other day couldn't row against the wind.
106398,Cast-Away,2007-08-23 01:07:00,790,"When trolling through unfamiliar water, lower your bow mounted electric motor if you have a fish finder mounted on it in order to see underwater obstructions before you run aground with your boat."
110862,irishfield,2007-09-06 17:59:00,26272,When you are in loaded Canoes....don't try paddling to your pick up point in 4 foot swells...the odd 6 footer...so you can be at the agreed pick up point for your father on time. Sit put..or two go in an empty canoe to the agreed pick up to direct to where the gear is stashed. Almost lost our 19 year old daughter and her 4 friends on Sunday afternoon. Thank God we had just rounded Devil Point in our 22 foot Lund as we watched in horror as one canoe get rolled and the other swamped. Thankfully I had left early for the pick up... as we could only push thru the entire 12 miles of the North East Arm of Lake Temagami at 16 MPH into these waves and we arrived at the exact agreed time....otherwise the outcome could have been very different. Needless to say all 7 of us ended up very wet...but everyone alive and I have two canoes to fetch from the bush in the next couple days. A few items lost to the depths of Lake T...but amazingly all electronic items still work.
114047,Vanselena,2007-09-15 02:21:00,269,"Forget the Canadian Tire get past the OPP safety kit. Buy Flares, have an air horn, install a bilge pump, keep a charged spare battery if your motor is electric start. Keep your eyes on the sky, on the big lakes if the wind picks up and remains strong after 5 minutes then leave."
114192,HTHM,2007-09-15 21:48:00,4082,Dont rely on just your cell phone as signal strength drops quickly out from shore.
115034,fishnsled,2007-09-18 15:28:00,3520,Carry a set of booster cables long enough to get from the trolling motor batteries to the starter battery.  You may just have enough juice at the end of the day to start the main motor to get you home if the starter battery fails.  Or get a boost from another boat.  Test your batteries regularly to make sure they are holding a charge.  If not holding a charge then replace them.
115138,Greencoachdog,2007-09-18 21:39:00,8163,ALWAYS CHECK THE WEATHER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!!!!
118341,holdfast,2007-09-27 23:57:00,1813,"When canoeing in rough water, into the waves and lower yourself by kneeling.  Have a decent first aid kit that can handle a deep gash. IE pressure bandage, not just band aids  When line is twisted troll, with nothing on the end to untwist  That loop on your spinning reel.  Pull line out with drag or take the spool off and pull your line off backwards to avoid coils  With compass ""off shoot"" for example instead of going directly to a cross roads.  Purposely go right so when you do end up on the road you definitely know to go left to the cross roads instead of guessing right or left if you are off the mark  Netted laundry bag makes an excellent anchor (with a rock after you portage) your canoe"
