117609,bassboy,2007-09-26 02:18:00,161,"TJ...I am very envious  As well....my most fav band of all time. The lyrics have thought put into them and tell a story. The music is very technical, complex, and well thought out (at least in my estimations anyway).  I have seen them a number of times myself, though not as of late.  As for fav songs, I could list far too many here, but if I were to pick three, would be La Villa Strangiato, YYZ.....was amazed when I learned Morse code and figured out that the first part of the song was based on the morse code for the airport code for Toronto, and then Jacob's Ladder...Does anyone know how many times Neil changes the timing on the fly in that song? Ill give that air guitar champion a run for his money if they want to do it to a rush song. Or even air drums for that matter  The talents of these guys never cease to amaze me......  Thanks very much for posting the pics TJ!!!!!!  Bill"
117641,Mike the Pike,2007-09-26 02:50:00,3421,Ya TJ I am also a huge fan of Rush last time I saw them was in the early 80's the Signals album tour.  My favorite album is 2112.  Great pics man
117703,huey graphite,2007-09-26 11:39:00,362,"Great pictures. It must have been quite an experience for Jaden.  I was in high school reading JRR Tolkein's The Hobbit when I got into Rush's Cares of Steel and it was interesting to see the references in the lyrics to the story of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  Saw Rush several times including in the early '90s when another great Canadian band, The Tragically Hip opened for them.  HG"
117715,musky66,2007-09-26 12:56:00,273,Took my 15 year old son to see them in Toronto last week. They are one of his favourite bands. even with all the new stuff he listens too. He is also a big April Wine fan and he will be seeing them for the 3rd time in November at the Grey Cup Classic. Canadian Rock Rules!!
117326,ScarSnake,2007-09-25 15:23:00,20,"Seen Rush ten times. Just couldn't swallow the ticket price this time around.  Best concert ever was Rush in Buffalo, with Marillion opening (my 2nd fave band at the time). They've had some great opening acts like Red Rider/Tom Cochrane, FM (surprisingly awesome), and others I can't recall just now.  I met Neil Peart at a Safewater Benefit concert back in the 80's. I bid on and won an autographed albumn (Signals). I still have it!"
117328,snoil,2007-09-25 15:33:00,139,I'm old.Rush played our high school...Love em.
117329,BrianV,2007-09-25 15:34:00,35," You didn't go to Lakeport, did you?"
117331,snoil,2007-09-25 15:38:00,139,Nope it was @ Etobicoke C.I.
117354,TJQ,2007-09-25 16:32:00,7806," I dunno.. they used them a couple of times   Like Geddy... when you are as famous as WE are you can get away with some things...   WE try to keep our kids pretty grounded.. it doesn't hurt that we really enjoy music so from the get go they had to endure our tunes.. which means they have grown on then as well.  To be honest other than  a few she new... she enjoyed the set of new stuff better than the old classics... which is a good sign for the band I think..  New Rush stuff has always taken a while to grow on me.. lol   You bet!!  For a while there... I don't think we listened to anything else... 'cept maybe April Wine!!  LOL   WE were lucky.. one of the guys we went with goes to alot of concerts and is on a few lists for good tickies I guess.. I was happy and to be honest for the experience I didnt think it was too much $$$...  In my heyday, I'd spend that at the bar in a heart beat (pre kids... LOL)  Ya I saw Santa.. lol...  front and center with ear plugs in!!  Did you see the little woman to his right.... she jumped up and down throughout the whole concert.. lol... never stopped once.. and knew EVERY word to EVERY SONG... even all the new stuff!!  She was 80lbs and couldn't have been more than 4 feet tall!!  AWESOME!!"
117389,John,2007-09-25 17:51:00,2956,  Dang good job that girl looks like her mother! 
117392,John,2007-09-25 17:54:00,2956,"Hmmm.....not sure why I got a photo of my new granddaughter in there, but she's cute too, so what the heck!!!!!!!!!!!!"
117481,fishdawg,2007-09-25 21:15:00,912,"very nice TJ I am only 26, but a big Classic Rock junkie  Lakeport - the highschool Neil went to, same as me  - sadly they are probably going to be closing the school in a year or two...  Lakeside Park (aka Port dalhousie) is one of my faves"
117511,Joey,2007-09-25 22:09:00,9122,That's great TJ.  I've always loved Rush.  My father lived across the street from Neil Pert for a long time and they became friends.  Great pics and Jaden looks awesome - You Rock Girl!!!!!  Joey
117541,dwc67,2007-09-25 22:50:00,140,did ya wear the retro geddy silver cape?
117557,holdfast,2007-09-25 23:33:00,1813,"Wow seen them way back in Montreal when they backed up Aerosmith at the forum.  Still remember my Buds standing on top of the back of the seats and six seats tipping with him to the next row as they were attached togeather.  The fans just plunked him back on the seats.  OH YEA, Yea YEA.  My wife bought us 2 tickets to see OZZY and Rob Zombie in Saskatoon. 5th row.  Luv it.  24th October cant wait"
