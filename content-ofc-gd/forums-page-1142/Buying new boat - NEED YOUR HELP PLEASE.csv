As many of you know I've been looking to buy me a newer boat for the past few weeks. I went to see one I liked tonight and am seriously considering buying it tomorrow. It is quite a bit of money so I want to make sure I don't take a wrong step or something. Most importantly how can I make sure the boat is free and clear? The seller looks decent guy but I'd like to be sure. Can you do a lien check for boats/trailer/motor/ similar to the one we all do for cars when buying them? If so can it be done on line as my time is very short....  I am going to have more questions as soon as I put my thoughts together but this is the most important one and I wanted to ask you all ASAP as it is getting late and I need to know TONIGHT or very first thing tomorrow morning...   Also how can I check the year when the main motor was manufacturered by the Serial number I have? Can I do it online as well?  Thank you very much to all who can help me out.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

As far as leins go - i was once told by a police officer that I should always have on the receipt that the item is "" free and clear of all leins"".  Make sure that the seller signs it.   You could probably do a search at the ministry   Hope that helps a little - and good luck with the purchase.   Don"
118392,vance,2007-09-28 02:16:00,719,don't know for sure but if you are buying a trailer with the boat there should be something about that a the DOT.I am sure someone like evinrude-dude who is in the business would know for sure.BUT be careful a friend of mine bought a boat cheap a few years back that was communal property in a divorce settlement and he was the one that suffered..  vance
