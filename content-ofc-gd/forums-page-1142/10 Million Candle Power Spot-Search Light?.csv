117867,fishnsled,2007-09-26 19:55:00,3520,"I've got 2 of them.  One that is battery operated and the other plugs into the cigarette lighter.  Both work great but I can't remember the brand names for the life of me.  I don't know that there is a way to extend the battery life because it draws the power needed to operate the bulb.  I'm no electrical wizard by any means but maybe a lower wattage bulb.  Lower draw, longer battery life???    When I couldn't find a proper replacement bulb for my unit I put in one that was 1/2 the watts and didn't notice a big difference (brightness wise) for my purposes."

117952,Tomcat,2007-09-26 23:25:00,395,"We used a 10 million candlepower light on the low setting to return to camp after fishing into darkness. Before we departed for  our fishing location (remote location with no access to power), we tested the length of operation of the light on the low setting. The 8 AH battery that came with the light would last about an hour. We estimated that that amount of power would get us back to camp only 2 evenings (30 minute ride). Consequently, we stripped down the light to bare essentials and took along a 30 AH battery to provide power for the week. Worked out fine. OK, the 30 AH battery weighed about 25 pounds. However, a generator that probably weight that much or more. This was our solution and no doubt there are many more."
