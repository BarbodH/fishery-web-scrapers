118293,addict,2007-09-27 21:56:00,475,"i will agree upsream fishing is flossing and a waste of time and i dont bother with it.but personally i dont care this is a put and take or put and die fishery.to my knowledge they dont reproduce,ihave caught many of yearlings and smolt rainbows but have never caught a baby nook.if this activity was that harming the mnr would step in with new regs.i say get some roe and wait for steel."
118296,Roy,2007-09-27 22:01:00,13728,"Well chilluns, I think that most people reading this thread were given an education but I suspect that most of what they learned had nothing to do with fishing. Really, to the uninitiated, this thread sounds like a fence war between the trout ""purists"" and the evil ""pagan"" salmon hunters.  Most of what people wanted to get off their chests has come out in this thread several times. So,we'll lock this one down and give everyone a chance to re-load and find new targets."

118236,misfish,2007-09-27 18:39:00,29133,"PM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It works,right Pete I use to see guys thrash through the river and not even know what they were doing ie:stepping in and distroying a laid bed.They would also see a couple of salmon swaying back and forth thinking theres an easy snag,yet what they didnt know,they were pulling them off the beds.Thats the only thing I see wrong. As for them dieing,yep they will,then they will stink the river up to high heavens. Take and eat so they say. I say be my guest.   I havent fished the credit in probly 20 years. Is there anyone here that fished it in the late 70,s earlly 80,s and are still fishing it? I would like to hear if you have found the number of salmon (chinnys) dropping or still the same. Im thinking they are probly close to the same,but there are way more fisher people."
118237,misfish,2007-09-27 18:42:00,29133,"  Hey Raf what up bud?  Im thinking when they get up to the streetsville area where it ""use"" to be santuary,not sure if that has changed or not,there has to be some reproduction going on up there. It use to hold the largest rainbow spawn I had ever seen. Thats about the only place I think the number could be higher.Other then that area and any other that is closed,it,s a total loss. IMO."
118238,aniceguy,2007-09-27 18:43:00,1094,"Brian I started fishing it in the early 80's first at my dads side when the dam at streetsville and went from there.  There are less nooks now then in those days partially due to less fish stocked, less stray's and a loss of access to habitat due to a management plan not allowing them above streetsville now."
118243,misfish,2007-09-27 18:51:00,29133,"Does anyone here remember back a couple of years ago when I had memntioned about ROTATING CLOSURES of the main tribs????????????????????????????  Might be something to think about,and yes I understand there is not enough manpower out there to inforce this ,but I really do think it would work and help the repoduction.  Just thought for conversation."

118254,Rich,2007-09-27 19:35:00,3927,"One of my favourite salmon experiences was fishing a creek with Sleded last year. It was late october and we were fishing steelhead. Sleded was casting a Cleo in a pool when this salmon came out of a logjam and smashed it. It chased the spoon probably 5 feet upstream before hitting, 3 of us witnessed it.    But nope, they don't eat."

Although you had many good points in which I agree 100% the way it came out was a little to touchy feely for me (if ya catch my drift, not literally)  Ive often wondered why folks dont print up some flyers and post them around local tribs....maybe hand a bunch out to some folks who are fishing the river."

118273,mooseroo,2007-09-27 20:34:00,80,Good link Raf! The short form is that a decent percentage of the salmon in the tribs studied had wild/reproducing populations of salmon.    Source

118034,danbo,2007-09-27 03:22:00,2646,"Same old story every year.. The King of salmon gets relagated to the rank of ""boot"". Every joker that can even tie a knot goes to the rivers to snag out a trophy. I find it very sad that so many ""Sportsmen"" have no respect for the wild things. Natives beleived the Salmon had souls & deserved utmost respect for the food they provided. Now it's a circus on the tribs.. Time to go bass fishing for me, instead of seeing the rapes going on our rivers."
118048,irishfield,2007-09-27 03:52:00,26272,"Dang....is it this time of year again already ! Thank god I'm heading back out fishing in a couple of days, for a couple of weeks, so I won't have time to read much of this sheeeet."
118049,Darek,2007-09-27 03:55:00,20,"What a joke. ""Guiding"" the rape hole at record low flow for decomposing chinooks. Any real steelheader wouldn't even think of fishing that spot in these conditions. But hey, to each their own I guess, whatever makes you feel like a champ"
118055,Beats,2007-09-27 04:14:00,543,"I just don't see why people want to catch fish that already look dead by the time you reel them in.  Fishing for salmon at piers and mouths of rivers is ok as the fish usually have some colour and life to them still and haven't yet been beat up by the rocks and brush of the rivers and creeks . IMO once they hit the creek rivers and especially the creek-sized rivers, they should be left alone to do their thing.  I know they will bite/attack spoons and other baits when they are entering the rivers but trying to get a near dead fish to EAT your lure in a pool the size of a hot tub and 3 feet deep is probably about as likely as having a carp randomly decide to chase and eat your spoon.  I just don't understand why ppl enjoy the act of catching fish that look like they are rotten/decaying.  It must just be for the overall size/weight of the fish to impress others.  I mean, if you were to show a pic of a river/creek salmon to your uncle who doesn't fish or your grandmother they would probably think that you caught the fish of a lifetime.  In reality, the fish is near death and most likely could be kicked onto shore and merely picked up.  A few years ago I visited Bronte creek for the first time and was amazed at the literally hundreds of dead salmon along the creek that were in piles all over the place where people had clearly stood over small pools and snagged fish, slit the bellies, taken the eggs, and then threw them into piles 1 foot from shore in the water and as well scattered them all over the shore  I guess that's fishing..."
118059,DMASSE,2007-09-27 04:21:00,420,"Its pretty clear BEATS that you have caught a salmon in the rivers.  Yes in about 2-3 week from now you will see the dead salmon that did do there business, and or the ones that people killed by slitting open the bellies for fresh roe, male and female...What can I say people are stupid  Anyway this is getting boring,  Like I said in the past if you dont like fishing for salmon then dont...  Fish for what ever you like, have fun and RESPECT other people..  ANICEGUY,  lets get out sometime and do some backwater fishing, I am sure we both have great  spots...  Dave"
118060,Beats,2007-09-27 04:27:00,543,"just a note: I have never caught a salmon of any kind in my life.  I tried in years past, and based on seeing how it was done never had any interest in it again."
118064,chilli,2007-09-27 04:34:00,199,I love the small streams but stay away come September. Not only do the salmon bring out the worst people but they bring out the worst in people. We're like a bunch of damm bears only we're trying to make it look legal. Well it doesn't look that way and the fish aren't very edible. The truth of the matter is it's primarily poorly skilled anglers or egg hunters screwing these streams over.
118071,Riparian,2007-09-27 04:47:00,269,"Still waiting for rain here and the steelhead to show up... I went down to the one of my favourite spots on lake huron today to check out the water levels.  Was suprised to see not even one dead salmon, the water is that low."
118074,fish_finder,2007-09-27 05:00:00,370,"I can see where this is coming from...but I can't see why  it is so large of an issue for you.   These are non-native fish....they have been put here for the simple reason of put and take.   Now...I am not condoning snagging or any other illegal means of fishing...but, what gives?   No Luck out there??   Dead or alive...these fish are doing nothing for what should be in our neck of the woods.  Ever seen Brook or Lake trout spawn?  I see no mention of the attacks on these NATIVE species!  I don't think the majority of anglers are out to gut a fish for its eggs, although they are out there!  If that was the case...our harbours would be full of carcases...which they aren't as opposed to the usual die offs and kills.  Although I fish for pacific Salmon...they are by no means high priority on my fish wish list....and I don't think guides should be targeted for influencing customers to fish for migratory fish......much like myself, your license fees pay for the stocking of these intruders, which I, personally think should be eliminated!  What good is an unsustainable fishery?????  $$$$$$....yes...I guess only in the lake from your point of view??"
118086,Riparian,2007-09-27 05:59:00,269,I agree with the above...
118090,Bojangles,2007-09-27 06:42:00,46,Good reply Louis... I'm glad you took the time to shed more light on Salmon in rivers.  Lol @ drifter24!
118095,solopaddler,2007-09-27 09:42:00,8605,Well just woke up and suddenly had the urge to go floss some fish in the nearest thermally stressed stream  . Later guys....
118219,Squid,2007-09-27 17:43:00,1656,"What a joke. Most of the guys that are ranting started fishing these salmom not knowing any better. These fish do not even reproduce in the river. They do this based on instinct. Stress the fish!! it's gonna die!!! I agree with Wayne this is sheeet. If you don't like what was posted then PM the guy, keep it off of the board!!"
118230,xrap,2007-09-27 18:18:00,683,"Wasn't thier a simular topic last year with a bunch of these expierenced ""steelheaders"" that got into it with CC. I'm pretty sure the guy was banned from the site and somewhat embaressed infront of a couple of other guys. Come on you guys know better, this is a great site don't let someone's post get to you. You certainly don't want to be banned from this site. Keep it on the low and go fishing"
118231,aniceguy,2007-09-27 18:23:00,1094,"Sites like this have many purposes and one of them is to educate anglers and that involves all gamits of fishing.  A thread like this is not designed to result in a charecter debate and hopefully it doesnt.  What it should do is hopefully educate some folks on some of the contentious points within the topic.  Oh by the way Chinook reporduction on the north shore of Lake ontario is in the 30 - 40 percent these days, so while its dependent on stocking, ( more of a habitat access issue) a lot of those fish are naturalized to the system.  Threre lies part of the entire issue a lack of awareness and knowledge on it, and up front sorry if it offends but the truth of the matter is the chinook fishery contributes to 140 million dollar direct and indirect Lake Ontario fishery.  The fish is naturalized at this point regardless of its origins its here to say.  Many of the eastern tributaries and in fact a good  portion  of Lake Ontario tributaries never recieved any stocking but yet have runs of naturalized fish.  See like all angling tactics this is one that needs some education"
118233,Raf,2007-09-27 18:31:00,3495, what is your source?  i understand *some* natural reproduction occurs but the actual percentage is more like 1%.
