That company makes everything from sewing thread to rope, and used to package about three different braided lines under the Tuf Line brand.  I don't know if they still do or not.  Originally, Power Pro was smaller in diameter, for a given pound test, than the Tuf Line products.  My understanding was it was wound under tension to more tightly compact the fibers.  When Western Filament introduced XP is was the same diameter as Power Pro and in use, I couldn't find any difference between them.  Tuf Line was cheaper in Canada, but the same price as Power Pro in the USA.  I have used the Spiderwire Stealth and thought it was about the same as Tuf Line...I would stay away from the cheaper lines like Gorilla Braid, I didn't have good luck with it or the old Berkley Fusion.
