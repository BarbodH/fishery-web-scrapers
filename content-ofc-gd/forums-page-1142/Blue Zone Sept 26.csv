Best results came in the 400 ft water 35 ft down. Everything worked Riggers,Dispey and leadcore.You can see these guys were in the river in the past year as there tails are worn down digging the redds."

118151,Smokey,2007-09-27 13:05:00,1278,Nice fish Iceguy. I've heard a few guys using the term blue zone lately. Can anyone explain to me what this is?  I'm just learning about fishing the big lake this year.  Thanks  Mike
118319,iceguy,2007-09-27 23:21:00,341,"The blue zone is about 12- 16 miles off shore, We head out of humber launch. Lot's of good fishing just have to be careful with the wave and weather."
118329,Smokey,2007-09-27 23:31:00,1278,Thanks for explaining iceguy.  Mike
