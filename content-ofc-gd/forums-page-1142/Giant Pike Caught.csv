Yep, Zander are big walleye.There was talk of bringing them to the states somewhere and doing a study planting some time ago.Can't remember where tho.  Kerry"
117550,Muskieman,2007-09-25 23:18:00,2472,or is it this one ?

117706,Kerry,2007-09-26 12:03:00,383,I remember seeing that one Dan a few years ago.Something tells me that one wasn't photoshopped.Apparently the U.K. one was.  Kerry
117110,Baptiste,2007-09-25 00:31:00,37,"On the back page of the Orillia Packet and Times on Saturday there was a very familiar story about a guy catching a giant pike...last week. It happened on (insert lake here) in this case Rainy Lake. The story was accompanied by two photos, one where a huge pike is biting a slightly less huge pike and another where the angler is holding the huge pike in the boat. Last Week...Rainy Lake...weird. I think I had a dream about this. It all seemed so eeirily familiar."
117114,danc,2007-09-25 00:35:00,4677,"Those photos are making the newspapers now? Rainy Lake this week, huh? I think it's Lake Nipigons turn next week."
117115,Rizzo,2007-09-25 00:36:00,4754,"ya, I've already heard the rainy lake one.  Wonder where the fish will be from next?  Might as well make it a longshot, my money is on Island Lake -Orangeville"
117116,danc,2007-09-25 00:41:00,4677, LOL...
117117,ecxstriper,2007-09-25 00:44:00,343,I was thinking about catching that pike next week myself . We should probaly start a number system . We wouldn't want that pike to be caught twice in the same week or even the same day . The UPA (united pike association ) won't put up with that.
117119,bigfish1965,2007-09-25 00:47:00,3382,That pike is living proof and C&R works. I think everyones brother/cousin/mailman has caught it. Oddly they are all wearing the same clothes at the time.
117120,danc,2007-09-25 00:48:00,4677,That picture is everywhere. I was in a clients office last week and there on the wall was THE picture.
117136,HTHM,2007-09-25 01:17:00,4082,Post the pic! You got me curious
117137,danc,2007-09-25 01:23:00,4677, No way man....
117142,Bear,2007-09-25 01:26:00,106,"wish i had the link Hometown, think this thing has been around for a couple yrs now"
117144,solopaddler,2007-09-25 01:27:00,8605,How 'bout this one? Caught it earlier this summer up at the lake...    
117157,Greencoachdog,2007-09-25 01:37:00,8163,That Pike was actually caught on Lewis Smith Lake down here in Alabama!!! We thought it was a mutant legless Alligator... so we BWASTED IT TO SMIVERWEENS with our 12 gauges!!!   Damn Invasive Species!!!!
117158,Bear,2007-09-25 01:37:00,106,
117171,Baptiste,2007-09-25 01:57:00,37,"Seriously, the bottom half of the page...small story about unknown angler and two big pics. coming to a drive-in near you THE PIKE THAT WOULDN'T DIE. (or go away)."
117233,snag,2007-09-25 03:54:00,1932, Now that's a hum-dinger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
117241,Roy,2007-09-25 10:21:00,13728,Rumour has it the fish was caught on a walleye rod.
117244,mcallister.grant,2007-09-25 10:40:00,327,I heard it was caught on an ultra light Roy?
117255,ccmtcanada,2007-09-25 11:56:00,7971, LOL...great one.  What I want to know is how did you find that old pic of me...it gives away where I caught the thing...jeez...there goes another hotspot.
117283,TJQ,2007-09-25 13:58:00,7806,I caught this one outta the same spot...   
117285,Rich,2007-09-25 14:00:00,3927,Well yeah you throw them on a mini and of course they're gonna look huge!
117313,Fishnfiend,2007-09-25 14:59:00,357, That looks like a musky TJ...
117370,BLACKFISH88,2007-09-25 17:01:00,191,Kinda reminds me of this one and a Lew smile to boot!!!LOL! 
117437,douG,2007-09-25 19:19:00,2693,  My brother says he knows a guy who says his cousin says his barber on his mother's side caught it on Nippissing a year ago last November.
117496,Kerry,2007-09-25 21:51:00,383,Every time I see that picture that dinkey looking berkley rod holder stands out and I have to laugh.I got one sitting on a shelf after having a 5lb walleye crack it on a troll.  Kerry
117544,Muskieman,2007-09-25 23:01:00,2472,"probably this one !!  these pics are from germany and the netherlands ,,, been there fishin' when i was younger definitely true as poop!!... our average pike from shore was 20 lbs + kinda like fishin' from a dock for sunfish at yer uncle's cottage in the summer... their average pike is bigger and way more abundant than our average Muskies... pike over 45lbs are caught regularly ...every year a 55-60lb is caught but is'nt registered as a record ... when i was there i seen a picture of an old man and the MONSTER.... they estimated this pike at about 75lbs and to me ...well I beleived it ... the pic was taken after WWII in the late 50's.  as for Rainy Lake and such stories ....naw not here.  Ya wanna se a 35 lb walleye?  go to Germany or Holland   .. they're called Zander... looks pretty much tha same as a Walleye .  but on average 2x the size."
