117383,FinS,2007-09-25 17:44:00,463,was wondering if anyone knew what these are called  they dont have any writting on them      
117385,keram,2007-09-25 17:46:00,585," Do not worry fish cannot read  , just use them."
117386,jediangler,2007-09-25 17:48:00,1923,"I can't remember what they are called but I know I had one years ago and it ran like crap. Always pulled to one side and when you went fast, it rolled over. No way to tune them either if I remember correctly."
117393,Headhunter,2007-09-25 17:55:00,5703,"The Green on is a Luhr Jensson (sp) Power Dive... apparently they don't make them any more... if you don't want it, I'll take it to Quinte with me this fall and show you how it really is!!! LOL If you can find a yellowish one, they are a great bait for fall Picker-eyes! The red one looks like a Bagley. (sp) HH"
117397,Zib,2007-09-25 17:57:00,369,Those are Luhr Jensen lures. The fat bodied one is called Hot Lips. The longer bodied bait is called the Power Dive Minnow.  I've caught some nice bass & walleye on both the Hot Lips & Speed Traps.   http://www.luhrjensen.com/

117627,Rizzo,2007-09-26 02:41:00,4754,"whatever they are, they're all too small.  When the lip is bigger than the bait you're undersized"
