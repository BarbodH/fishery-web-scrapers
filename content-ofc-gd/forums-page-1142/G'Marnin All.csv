118093,Photoz,2007-09-27 09:00:00,792,"STB?? How are you guys finding your fave perchin' spot? Badly weeded up? I took a run up to Barrie last week . . . .    the whole Tiffen boat launch area is blocked off . . . . .     constructing SOMETHING? Up toward the fountain, and up just north of the marina it's so badly weeded up, you'd need about 5 ounces of lead to get your bait down through 'em! Didn't even try. I still have very little night vision . . . .     that 3 months of treatments really screwed my vision, but, it's STARTIN' to come back. Hopefully I'll be in decent shape for when the trout show up. I'll be watchin' for your results posted later today . . . .    I guess that ditch you use for a boat launch will be dried right up by now?"
