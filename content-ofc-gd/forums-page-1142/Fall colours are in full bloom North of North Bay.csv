Dropped in there on Monday for some pike fishing and thankfully I'd just changed my memory card over from the last months worth of pictures to a new blank memory card. If you have time next season maybe you can drop in there and find it for me....oh...and maybe my leatherman knife from Spawning Lake as well...Thanks!  Hope to get a post or two together before heading for Montreal on Sunday AM. Can't believe the summer is over and how fast it went by....but I know there's no sympathy for me here... LOL  Leah's off to Henry's Camera tomorrow..... for my third Canon digital of the season!  This is the way this season went...."

118149,Smokey,2007-09-27 13:02:00,1278,Too bad about the camera. I was thinking we'd get to see some aerial shots for the first time this year. It's amazing how quickly the leaves seemed to change this year. It's my favorite season and it's just beginning.  Good luck with the new purchase  Mike

118156,Terry,2007-09-27 13:19:00,14456,you might want to look into a camera that floats  or you could build a set of floats for your new camera....you just know it will end up in the water
