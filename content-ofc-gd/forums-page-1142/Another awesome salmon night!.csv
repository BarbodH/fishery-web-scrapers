Persisted through it and were rewarded with a couple solid hits and fish-ons...but soon became fish-offs. After the rain died down, my bud soon hooks into one that wasn't gonna get away. Nice male.    Then the night became day, and i was prepared to be skunked again. I switch the good ol' cleo for a chrome rattlin canadian wiggler, and casted it out only for it to be chased by seagulls. I think it was about my third cast out, when the lure hit the water, big splash and it was fish on baby! I've never experienced a hit from so far, and so topwater like. nice silver female inhaled the lure.    Both my buddy and I were 1 for 4 that night. Now my question is... would larger topwater lures be effective? Never really seen anyone go this route."

118079,Dozer,2007-09-27 05:30:00,896,Was that you guys at the Bluffs today?
118121,ccmtcanada,2007-09-27 11:53:00,7971,Great job!!!  Awesome pics and report.  They are much nicer catching them before they enter the tribs...much prettier fish.   Last night was a good one for me as well....seems the rains from the previous night/morning brought more of them closer to shore.
118123,Blake,2007-09-27 11:57:00,418,Great pics and reports.  Haven't used top waters but a slow falling weightless plastic may take a few.
