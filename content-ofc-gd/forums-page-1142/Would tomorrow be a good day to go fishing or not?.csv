I have the chance to take the day off work tomorrow and go fishing down at the Toronto Islands - probably for the Islands 'Big 4' - Bass, Carp, Pike and Salmon.  However what with the weather forecast to be cool and cloudy, I'm wondering if it would be a waste of time and better to save my time off for a day with better weather.  Can the fishing be good in such conditions?  Thanx for any advice  007"

Whats in your hand.Nothing right so what do you have to lose nothing right.Go and fish and post us a great report you always have great shots and we enjoy them .Good Luck

If you're in Toronto head down to the lake shore and give a few casts over by the canoe rental harbour. ( By the mouth where they launch the Kayaks ) I'm pretty sure you'll be pleasently suprised! This time of year especially... Trust me on this one.   FHR"

118114,ccmtcanada,2007-09-27 11:44:00,7971,I'd go fishing if I were in your shoes.  The cold front actually came across yesterday and I had a great night of fishing.  Good luck! (if you go)
