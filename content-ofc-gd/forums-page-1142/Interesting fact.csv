117891,jedimaster,2007-09-26 20:33:00,3472,Thats about 24 beers per year.  I am always trying to improve my fuel economy.
117899,JohnF,2007-09-26 20:55:00,3494, Jeez. You buy big beers.  JF
117907,jedimaster,2007-09-26 21:06:00,3472,Don't you buy the big ones from montreal? lol yah yah too much beer not enough calculator.  Missed a decimal 240 beers per person. That seems like alot. I wonder where they come up with that stat. I know I don't go through a 24 per month...Well at least not since I left college.
