I've never fished the islands so I expected a long day of walking and wasn't sure what I would catch. I packed my backpack and took a couple of spinner rods and off I went. Started out fishing the harbour for a half hour while I waited for my ferry, nothing much was taking but I didn't have that much time.  Headed over in the ferry and started walking. Found some boat docks and decided to start my day there. Flipped jigs under the docks, caught a couple perch but nothing to write home about. Noticed alot of small largemouth bass and was hoping that their mother's were nearby Started working a spinner bait off a bigger dock and immediately had a pike hit. Brought it in after a quick fight, turned on my camera and noticed my batteries were dead...DAMN! Let the pike go (Just a small jack pike) and cursed my luck. Started walking again and found some green weeds under an overhung tree...BANG! Big largemouth, brought it in and it was about 3 pounds. That was about it for the rest of the day as it's hard to find places that hold fish when it's your first time there due to the size. I've found a couple places that I will try next time. Also noticed a lot of Carp which I'd like to come back for."
117461,BrianV,2007-09-25 20:17:00,35,Hmm... perhaps I should try the islands sometime. It's only about 45 minutes' driver from here (Hamilton).
117504,dsn,2007-09-25 22:04:00,1018, Watch it they are back breakers. I should know. ha ha ha. And if your not careful they are rod breakers too. And gear destroyers.  
117508,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-25 22:06:00,698, That's why they are so much fun to fish for
117546,007,2007-09-25 23:04:00,537,"Sounds like a reasonable day.  Better than being in the office.  Pity about the camera and no pics.  Which ferry did you end up catching?  I've found that the Islands can be either the best place you've ever fished or the most frustrating place ever.  Either way you usually end up covering a lot of ground and keepin fit! You'll always spot some fish though, it's just whether they are interested in biting that's the problem.  007"
117551,MJL,2007-09-25 23:18:00,2427,"Nice report.  Islands are always worth a try for carp.  I've seen some real biggins cruising in most canals. In all the times I've fished them over the years, I don't think I've ever blanked.  Great carp fishery close to home."
117574,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-26 00:32:00,698," I ended up catching the centre Island Ferry and walking from there. Next time I need to bring over a bike, it would be a lot easier."
117678,sharper,2007-09-26 04:05:00,279,The islands are really good. It could be a hit and miss at times. The only bad thing is the walking! Walked from Halans Point to Wards one time and it was a mission.
117755,ccmtcanada,2007-09-26 14:41:00,7971,"Sounded like a good day out there!  A slow day of fishing beats a quick day at work anytime in my books.  You caught a few fish (or so you SAY you did...no pics....LOL), so at least there was no skunk.  Good job!"
117793,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-26 16:00:00,698," LOL! I'm changing my report, I actually caught 10 bass, 5 Pike and a Salmon."
