He's 12 weeks old, that's the main reason I haven't been out doing much of the goooood stuff lately but after the rain last night I couldn't resist. Brought the 12 footer to work with me seeing that my work place backs on to a feeder creek between Oshawa and Cobourg. (That should be enough of a hint) The fish are everywhere, only fished for an hour. Two chinnys and one steelie on the river bank but virtually every drift was a take down. Get out there while it's hot boys and girl, I think with the fish having to stage for such a long period of time because of the low water this may very well be one of the bigger runs of the season, not to mention come this weekend alot of the fishable water to the north will be closed until April. Good luck to all B"
