117850,tonyb,2007-09-26 19:11:00,1637," That's why you sometimes have to look into some other key identifying features when a fish looks a lot like a similar fish.  In this case, the huge anal fin gives it away.  Chinooks have the largest (most rays) anal fin of all the Salmon.  So it is true what they say...the best way to identify a keeper is by checkin' out the ass"
