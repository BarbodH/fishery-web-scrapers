116305,dr_freelgood,2007-09-21 23:50:00,13,"402 hook points      134 trebles. If I am lucky enough to win, I will send it off to Maureen to use at the ice derby next year."

116390,JohnF,2007-09-22 14:27:00,3494,"I counted all the little fishy looking heads, multiplied by 2.17835 for multiple and damaged hooks (assuming a treble with missing hooks is now a double or a single or a nilble), divided by 1.33333 for missing hooks, and added 23 for the unattached hooks sneakily planted under lures and in shadowy corners and got 47 1/2 rounded up to 48. That's my carefully calculated and considered guess.   48  JF"

115484,aplumma,2007-09-19 19:46:00,6896,Well after counting all of the hooks and seeing that over half of them were dull I came up with an official count of 118 treble hooks.  The exact winner is EC Milley for his guess of 118. The second winner was Slowpoke with his guess of 116.   I would like to Thank you Jen and Pete for providing this prize for the Tyler Foundation last winter as a prize for the auction. The extra mile that your company goes for all of us fisherpeople is greatly appreciated.  Ec Milley and Slowpoke check you P.M. box to receive your code for your $25.00 gift Certificates. Please note that they will expire on 12/31/2007 so shop quick and shop often.  A final thanks to our fearless leader for permiting  ME to have this contest on this site even if the lawyers did not get a chance to approve it.
