117462,maward,2007-09-25 20:22:00,2,"got back saturday from my yearly trip to camp ashtabula,  may be my last with the dollar parity now and a bit of a hassle at the border and not to mention the inability to get some sales tax back for us from the u.s.  any ways the fishing was so so with seven musky from 29 to 45 inches, acouple nice largies and smallies and walleye mixed in and some perch for the table.  all but a couple of the bass and perch were released healthy.  i must say i had to work xtra hard for the fish this year,  the rising barometer and warm weather of last week didn't help much, but as they say a day fishing is better than a day at work.  the muskies like black and orange and natural and gold and all the nicer other fish were caught while casting for muskie. [i cast 98% of the time, maybe troll from one area to the next if i feel like it]  the 45 was a personal best for my fishing partner as was his 5# smallie."
