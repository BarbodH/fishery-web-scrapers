This really is a wonderful Lake.Much more cool structure that a guy could fish in many many years.Despite the poor moon phase we did very well.3 inch gulp minnows ,crawlers and frozen shiners all produced well.The boats were were well maintained and gassed by 7 a.m. each day I look forward to my return. That Pike came off Wolf Island by the way Connie. Kevin does indeed live to fish.and happy to share his info.This is a very reasonable trip into an exciting lake and I would recommend a visit to anyonewho has comtemplated it."

117586,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-26 01:03:00,957,"Nice job with the photos Bryon.  You guys had a good week.  Wolf Island was good to us also, and some other fishermen wrote me that they hit them hard on Fishgut Rock, Three Sisters and Gull Rock.  So much for my weak moons.  Thanks for the report.  It got me fired up.  I'm heading for the 51st latitude tomorrow morning.  Out of the driveway way before the sun comes up."
