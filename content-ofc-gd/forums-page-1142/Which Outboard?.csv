117741,doubleheader,2007-09-26 14:22:00,497,"The truth is most any choice can be the right one depending on personal preference.  I've had Mercs and Hondas and I now have a Merc Verado- all have been great. I'm sure E-Tec, Yamaha, and Suzuki are also excellent choices. All this Bull on how fast one goes compared to another or fuel economy is somewhat trivial and almost always biased in my mind. Reliability is the most critical feature- period.  Personally I like the 4- strokes. The comment that they haven't been around that long is untrue- my 1997 Honda 50 is a 4 stroke and it still runs great. In 10 years I had one problem. The flywheel came apart 2 years out of warranty and Honda covered it 100%. I would, however, suggest fuel injection. I've heard great things about the new Honda 90 hp. Hondas are bullet proof for sure and they are great at standing behind their products.  Make sure whatever you buy you can get serviced to your satisfaction. In other words do your homework on the dealer. Last, look for some great incentives like free extended and/or transferable warranties (read the warranty details as they are not all the same)."
117742,corvette1,2007-09-26 14:23:00,1765,i know they all break but i would like more than two years just my opinion
117757,doubleheader,2007-09-26 14:44:00,497,"Corvette1, I couldn't agree more.  One of the reasons I bought my Verado was a 6 year warranty. Bigcreekdad, beware of people that slam other brands.  Most of the time there is an agenda."
117758,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-09-26 14:50:00,39,"your going to need that 6yr warranty and i hope you have a big bank account for the gas consumption.The Verados are gas pigs.No agenda here just letting people know the truth because you won't here from mercury.HIDDEN AGENDA THAT""S LAUGHABLE.  ENJOY YOUR BIG BLACK ANCHOR LOL !!!!!!!!!!"
117795,corvette1,2007-09-26 16:04:00,1765,thanks doubleheader i think a verado will be on my next pro-v 40% better gas my freind  is buying two 250 verados for lake

117803,Tybo,2007-09-26 16:28:00,1373,"First I would like to start by saying,  the E-tec is all hype.  A friend of my that money is no object owned a 2025 Lund pro V. It was a 2000 with a 225 Opti on it.  Beginning of last season he bought the same boat,with a 225 E-tec.  Not long ago we were talking. He tells me that his E-tec has lower fuel efficiency,less power then his Opti and runs like dirt in the rain. He tell me that he like the engine. theres truly nothing wrong with it. The only thing that peeves him, is how much the salesman kept telling how better this engine was over the merc. Then he joke. They must have compared there E-tec to a regular merc 2 stroke. I have tendencies too believe this man. For he puts over 150 hours on the engine a year.  True engine efficiency does not come from the engine,but the prop you use. A stainless is better then aluminum. A cleave over stainless .A four blade over three.  Merc will also sell more engines then all the other manufactures will build."
117808,doubleheader,2007-09-26 17:02:00,497,"E.D. have you read many posts on the site? Generally folks try to get along. We all have our preferences, some as a result of personal experience, some from trusted friends and acquaintances, some for no reason at all other than it's what they believe, but for the most part folks express their opinion and personal bias(that means preference)  without feeling the need to attack another person's opinion.  It's called maturity. As for the gas my Verado uses here's the deal- I can afford it dude. And guess what, if I don't like my boat or motor I'll get rid of it because.... you guessed it, I can afford it.  I have no agenda,  I'm not a boat dealer, just a guy responding to a guy with a question. You on the other hand are in need of help before you can help someone else."
117824,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-09-26 18:22:00,39,OF COURSE MERCURY WILL SELL MORE ENGINES THEY OWN EVERY ALUMINUM BOAT COMPANY EXCEPT FOR FOUR.DO YOU REALLY THINK IT IS FAIR THAT A COMPANY FORCES YOU TO BY THEIR MOTOR ? THE LEGEND THREAD COMES TO MIND.YOU ARE AWARE OF COURSE THAT THE VERADO CANNOT BE FIXED AT A DEALER BECAUSE IT MUST BE FIXED AT THE FACTORY WITH A COMPUTER.OH YEAH I FORGOT MONEY IS NOT AN ISSUE I SURE HOPE NOT LOL !WHERE IS THE PERSONAL ATTACK BY THE WAY I GUESS IGNORANCE REALLY IS BLISS.

117840,tonyb,2007-09-26 18:57:00,1637,So Brunswick Marine owns Mercury and Lund right? Why is it that I can put a Honda on the back of a Lund?  Does Brunswick also own Honda?  Tony

117889,ecmilley,2007-09-26 20:28:00,2163,"I would think the 4-strokes have been around near long enough to determine there reliability, a 4 -stroke will outlive a 2 stroke  and uhem a 2 stroke will always use more oil than a 4 stroke engine  , no mix required  i don't mind any of the outboards available today but if slammings required i really wouldn't trust my hard earned cash to any brp product, seeing most of my friends 2-stroke sleds have a hard time getting 2500 km out of them without frying a crank withe either power-tek or sdi controls how much different can a outboard be from brp? let them show me some quality with a machine they have been building for the masses since 1961 i believe i maybe i would buy into that e-tech technology. At this point after sampling the available technologys on the water. snow ect, i would say 4 stroke technology is just as good if not better than 2-stroke technology and it's here to stay"
117910,boatman,2007-09-26 21:24:00,350,"4 stroke technology is definately here to stay. Its been around as long as we've had outboards. Its only really been the last 20-30 years that the technology has become viable. However, to say that a 4 stroke outboard will outlive a 2 stroke is a bit of an overstatement. Only time will tell. There are outboards still in service that are approaching 100 years old. I have several from the 1950's that run like new and have never been rebuilt.  You may prefer 4 stroke, but it hasn't proven to be superior, yet. If it was then all outboards of all hp ranges would be 4 stroke and we wouldn't question it. I certainly don't mind 4 strokes. In fact, I was saddened to hear that BRP is letting the Johnson (4 stroke) line of outboards die. If I was to buy a new 4 stroke outboard I'd get a Yamaha or a Honda even if Johnson was still building them - actually Suzuki was building them. Mercury's will all be Tohatsu's (probably) soon enough.  Also, snow machines and outboards are too different to be compared. Snow machines just don't hold up like outboards."
117930,fishdawg,2007-09-26 22:26:00,912," didnt know they were gonna stop making them.  I am the original owner of an '04 30 hp 4 stroke Johnson tiller. Love it, not a single hiccup yet.... I plan on keeping it for a very long time... hopefully aqiring parts for maintenance wont be difficult later on....."
118057,irishfield,2007-09-27 04:18:00,26272, Absolute Bull...my 275 Verado burns 12.2 Gallons/hour at 42MPH on a 2150 Baron. That is less than 0.3 gallons per mile. AT WOThrottle it burns 35 gallons per hour and I'm doing 61 MPH...max burn is thus about a half gallon a mile. I've used less fuel this year....with more time/distance on the water...than I did last year with my 115HP 2 stroke Johnson on a 17' boat. Hasn't used a drop of oil since it's first 10 hours break in.  ...and by the way..how many Evinrude/Johnsons did you have blow up on warrantee this year. Temagami Marine had 9 brand new BRP engines blow their power heads this season. Warrantee's great...but doesn't do much for the cottager up for 2 or 3 weeks with no boat.  The previous 2 years it was the larger Hondas with issues. Haven't seen a Merc torn apart on the floor there yet.  ..and can I hazard a guess that Evinrude-dude = Spectaculure
118106,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-27 10:59:00,621," really I would not say that I own a Dodge and I run Merc,Ive runned Optimax's and Verado's Lets see how many hours and miles Ive done 3335 000 km on my dodge and 1000's of miles on all my merc's Pretty cheap in the long run if I tally up the repairs and probs Ive had,which are insignificant  I would have to say,You really do not know what your talking about  In a competive and comparative market no one is the best"
118108,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-27 11:06:00,621," Ya but I beat up others for my Dad,so its me you gotta face"
118110,Terry,2007-09-27 11:15:00,14456,"chuck liddell offered to stand up for my dad, so I said I  would sit this one out"
118113,Randy,2007-09-27 11:43:00,115,I replaced my 11 year old 50 HP evinrude 2-stroke this year with a new e-tec. I'm pleased with the quietness of the engine and the total absence of smoke. I'm especially pleased with the significant reduction in the amount of fuel I burn. I haven't taken any measurements but it seems I'm using about half the fuel I used to compared to the old 2 stroke. I bought my e-tec this past winter and got the 7 year warranty. It was the warranty that sold me.  The big reductions in fuel and no smoke mean big reductions in emissions. My effort for global warming.
118198,Tybo,2007-09-27 16:06:00,1373,"So if Merc is a Chrysler and their suppose to be crap?  Why do you see so many Neons and older mini vans on the road.   No one is saying E-tec's are junk. What I see is that they don't match up to BRP makes them out to be.  I have read some independent testing results and not one said that the E-tec is a better engine then the Opti, but a equal. The one thing that the reports said is that they are not as fuel efficient. the reports on the net, you just have to look."
118223,PERCHER,2007-09-27 17:57:00,787,It wont help TYBO he is blinded by Evinrude .And everything else is junk especaily Mercs.
117650,boatman,2007-09-26 03:00:00,350,"""The E tec is a glorified Ficht engine fellas the one that bankrupted OMC ,it has lil or no more power than its 4 stroke competition of the same size,dont be fooled by the hype "" - That's crap.  They are all good motors. You see more Mercury's now because Brunswick Marine owns everything (not really but it seems like it) and they only want to put their motors (Mercury) on their boats. There is no ""most reliable"" outboard. Any of the motors you mentioned are fine. Personally I'd buy an ETec. Price + economy + power/weight ratio = the winner. JMO"
117698,lookinforwalleye,2007-09-26 10:54:00,4399,I love it motor wars everybody has a preference my is Yamaha so far so good. When I was looking I tried to find a dealer who put E-Tecs on his packages and could not find one.
117704,2 tone z71,2007-09-26 11:43:00,1311," Boat man ive got an E tec 115 ,my boss has 2 200 HOs ON THE 26 center console work boat,his brother has a 250 on a pursuit and a 115 on a whaler,my dads been a OMC mechanic going on 15 yrs ive been buying parting selling outboards since 1999,ive driving many many boats with many many motors,what are you comparing your results with the DVD that sinks the Yamaha"

117721,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-09-26 13:04:00,39,"HEY PERCHER YAMAHA HASN'T MADE MERCURYS MOTORS SINCE 2005. WHY DO YOU THINK YAMAHA BOUGHT A BOAT LINE (G3) ? THEY HAD TO BUY A BOAT LINE SO THEY WOULD HAVE SOME WHERE BTP PUT THERE MOTORS.AND JUST FOR THE RECORD AS WELL THE EVINRUDE ETEC DOES BURN MORE OIL IN THE BREAK IN PERIOD BECAUSE IT IS A 2 STROKE BUT AFTER BREAK IN THEY BURN HALF THE OIL A 4 STROKE DOES!!!!!!! THIS IS WHY I WOULDN'T BUY A HONDA EITHER.THEY ARE QUIET BUT THEY ARE THE HARDEST MOTORS TO START WHEN THEY ARE WARM.HONDA HAVE JUST AS MANY PROBLEMS AS MERCURY.WHEN I SPEND $30,000 ON A BOAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE ANY MOTOR I WANT BUT MERCURY HAS MADE IT SO THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY THERE MOTOR.PERSONALLY THIS IS BLACK MAIL BY A COMPANY WHO OBVIOUSLY KNOWS THEY HAVE THE LESSER PRODUCT.IF YOU WANT TO PUT AN ANCHOR ON YOUR BOAT GO RIGHT AHEAD.AS FOR THE VERADO BY MERCURY DO ANY OF YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH GAS THESES MOTORS BURN.275 VERADO IS 2MILES TO THE GALLON LOL !!!  EVINRUDE ALL THE WAY NO BETTER MOTOR OUT THERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
117723,taper,2007-09-26 13:05:00,611,I think all new motors are quite good. My father in law has a new Merc and I have a new Yamaha the Yamaha is a bit quieter than the Merc. Also Yamaha has been very pro active with customer satisfaction surveys with their products so far ( nice to see they are worried about what you think after they have your money ). My kicker is also a Yamaha and if I buy again it will be another Yamaha.
117730,boatman,2007-09-26 13:21:00,350,"2 Tone, I agree that video is crap. Complete crap. Its a marketing tool. Your comments suggest that the ETec is just a piece of Ficht junk and does not make good on any of its claims, which is simply not true. But I'm not here to defend them. I just don't like misinformation. There has been enough objective testing to support that the ETec is more fuel efficient and has fewer emmissions than most outboards.  Evinrude would be my choice, however I also stated that any of the outboards mentioned would be fine.  Also Yamaha and Mercury are going their separate ways. I'm not sure if any 2008 Mercury's are using Yamaha parts."
117731,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-09-26 13:23:00,39,FORGOT THE BEST PART OF ALL.EVINRUDE OFFERS 7YR WARRANTIES DURING BOATING SEASON AND WAS OFFERING 5YR WARRANTIES FROM JUNE TO JULY.TO GET THE EXTRA 4YRS WITH MERCURY YOU NEED TO SPEND $ 4000 !! AS FAR AS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION YAMAHA IS GOOD BUT EVINRUDE OFFERS THE SAME WITH WAY MORE WARRANTY.BOYCOTT MERCURY THEY ARE NOT DOING ANY OF US BOATERS ANY FAVORS.
117732,corvette1,2007-09-26 13:35:00,1765,i have a 115 evinjunk on my lund pro v blew up twice just after warr was up would not cover any thing merc next time
117736,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-09-26 13:59:00,39,any motor can blow up and yes there have been issues with the 115 this is why you don't see a 135 hp by evunrude.Key word blew up After Warranty what do you want a free ride for life ? trust me if the merc blew up after warranty you wouldn't be getting anything from them either if anything it would be worst.mercury is by far the worst to deal with.poor quality and constant problems.Why do you think they keep changing who makes them.They can't stay with anybody for any extended period of time.Do you think that a dealer who is Mercury specific is going totell you something good about an evinrude ? We sell both and i know the true reality. 4 STROKES HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH FOR A FAIR COMPARISON !! Not to mention mercury just put out a slam campaign against Evinrudes.Why do they care if they have the best motor and own everything ?..... because they are nervous and know there product doesn't compete and the only way they can respond is to tell lies to the consumer.Why not spend those million of dollars making your motors better ?Mercury is the Crysler of the boat world.Let's buy everything thing and then ruin the quality buy trying to make them cheaper.Cheaper parts make cheaper motors !!!
