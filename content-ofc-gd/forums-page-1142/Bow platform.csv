I have a 176 Princecraft and the bow area where my trolling motor would mount to has become soft and fungus growing out of the carpet.  I know I need to replace the wood and  was wondering how thick should I go and where to pick up carpet that matches the rest of the boat... which happens to be burgandy.   Thanks  Ken"

You can use the old floor as a template to cut the new one.  You can contact any Princecraft dealer to get the carpet, I think it only comes 6' wide (mine did).  It won't be cheap, but the colour will match."
