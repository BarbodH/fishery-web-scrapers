You know who you are and thanks so much, it really is for the cause.  There are 6 yes......6 draw prizes...all incredible prizes and if you get 5 or more tickets you get in on the mini draw which I will be announcing the winner Aug 11th.  There are only 10 days left to get your tickets...still time to get them back for the draw, so lets see if we can have a sellout on the tickets.  Just Pm me your address and how many tickets you want and I'll mail them immediatly.  Thanks again folks, you have shown the support of the fishing community the way it should be.  Cheers  Matt"
