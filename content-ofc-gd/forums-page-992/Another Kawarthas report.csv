230071,ehg,2008-07-20 06:11:00,2666,"Hi, went up to Pigeon Lake with buddy Dave to try a some fishing and had a decent day. Nearly stepped on this when we arrived at spot. Nice little green snake.  We went up thinking we would troll for muskies and stick with that, but that didn't last long. Seemed that bass were hitting topwaters so we did that mostly. (like always) Ended up catching many largies but nothing big.   Even caught alot of similar sized smallmouth.   The ever popular rock bass was also hitting topwaters   The basses were hitting topwaters even around lilypads in slop but i found it hard to get hookset with the weedless frogs and missed a few nice fish in that stuff.  Did end up doing a musky troll for a bit and tried around deep structure in main basin. For some reason i put on a perch shallow raider for a deep water troll, and ended up catching a musky on it while over 55' of water.  The musky fought well and jumped numerous times near the boat It measured a bit over 46 inches.  Of course the release  Forgot to get team entry sign in a picture from too much mayhem and excitement from musky.  Turned out to be a better day than usual, i think due to full moon effects, as the fish were on here for us.  cheers, ehg"
230073,Musky or Specks,2008-07-20 06:34:00,2710,According to my guru Mike Lazurus. Thats the way your supposed to troll. You sift the water starting shallow and working deeper with every pass. Its very effective as you now know
230082,Billy - Curtiss,2008-07-20 10:39:00,241,Sounds like a great day dude! Nice musky! More inches for the team! Or did you forget your sign?!  edit - I guess it pays to read the fine print! Too bad about the sign!

230462,ehg,2008-07-21 02:36:00,2666,"Thanks for replies! Probably caught a couple of dozen 1-2 lb bass mostly once the angle of sun was lessening. It was so sunny and hot out there yesterday it felt like we were in a microwave. Didn't get to lake till about 10:30 am so we fished mostly in the heat and sun. Caught the musky about 2:00 in the afternoon after the bass shut down a little, went off the lake after that fish to get out of sun for an hour or two. The bass were mostly caught in the late afternoon and evening. It was almost a fish a cast as the sun was setting. Personally i've done this enough to notice a higher feeding activity, probably from full moon phase.  cheers, ehg"

230524,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-21 11:38:00,1362,great report ehg!!...man does that Muskie ever look healthy...nice colour to her!!
230574,ehg,2008-07-21 13:43:00,2666,"Was marking fish in 10-15 ft. of water no matter what the depth. Decided on this lure since i planned on trolling by humps and reefs topping out at 12 ft. and didn't want to mess around with weeds or other snags. Luckily, caught this off structure. It's a nice fish for sure.  Fished the north part of Pigeon since i was a wee lad, my favorite place in the world! cheers, ehg"
