230403,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-07-21 00:57:00,0,"Hey guys,  As much as I would like to find and explore rivers/spots holding bass, it seems I always get skunked everywhere I go except Goderich ... which is almost 3 hours driving from my place (I could not stand it ..)  It seems to me that pictures with huge bass (2lb+ is huge to me .. how sad) are mostly taken from boats ... does it mean that unless I just want to kill time otherwise I should not bother to go bassing?  Any information regarding how to read bass holding spots in rivers or where good spots to get me started would be greatly appreciated  Otherwise ... I may start throwing our all those bass stuff I have bought .. (didnt really get into bass fishing until this year ..)  Thanks"

230515,Victor,2008-07-21 11:20:00,1609,"i feel for ya FFL.  I'm kinda in the same boat. Have never been able to catch the bass also ... didn't do so well when I was shore-bound, now that I have the boat I only managed ONE 12-13"" fish each trip.  I read up on a lot of reports, articles, but it just doesn't work when I'm out there. I guess the only thing we can do is ... ""keep at it""."
230525,bushart,2008-07-21 11:40:00,2628,Current breaks--undercut banks are usually gold---eddies---bridge structures are money--slack water weedlines.  If your driving to Goderich---grab a buddy and a canoe and trip the Saugeen up to Walkerton/Paisley area---tons of beaut smallies  If your fishing from shore the ponds(Small lakes) in Waterford have or had some big Largies (and prehistoric snapping turtles)  These will get the rust off that bass gear---but if your fishing clearwater rivers go lighter in techniques---light line--spinners/tubes and such.  Now if all this fails--Whatta ya want for your stuff
230533,Greencoachdog,2008-07-21 12:02:00,8163,"I have my best luck shore fishing for Bass around/off of deep water rip rap covered slopes... bridges, causeways, and dams. Bass hang around these places because of the minnows that feed on the algae on the rocks and the Crawdads that hide in the rocks. Light spinning tackle, light line, and inline spinners work best. Keep moving until you find the fish."
230535,BITEME,2008-07-21 12:04:00,1969,I wish i could keep the bass off long enough to catch other fish
230539,Spiel,2008-07-21 12:10:00,9065,.....Good advice above but you are driving right past one of the best smallie rivers in southern Ontario where you can use it. Try exploring the Grand River in the Cambridge area. It's bass heaven.
