230348,Seaweed,2008-07-20 22:50:00,135,Got out on the river finally on Sunday hoping to get a few hours in before the big storm they were calling for hit.  The storm never did show up for the party.  But the Bass did.   8)  Sunday fun   Getting nicer   Third time lucky   Nice hog   I came off the water at about 1pm because the wife said that the storm was close... it's six now and it still hasn't rained.  Oh well.  Nice pre-fish for the SEBO tournament on the Ottawa out of Rockland next weekend.  There should be some nice bags brought in.  Although who knows what the rain this week will do to things?  Here are some shots of last weeks single fish outings... it has been a bit slow on the river for me this year.  Last weekend    First catch

230691,Seaweed,2008-07-21 17:57:00,135,Still have to find a partner Johnny.  Any of you folk get up this way drop me a line and we can get out on the river for what ever species you want to try for.  A OFC gathering in this neck of the woods might be interesting someday... tons on great fishing.
