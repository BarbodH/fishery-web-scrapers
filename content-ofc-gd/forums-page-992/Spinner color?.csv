230434,modny,2008-07-21 01:49:00,502,throw everything u got sonny
230439,Leecher,2008-07-21 02:01:00,7832,Personally I'd use white & red spinners or black ones.  LM
230446,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-21 02:09:00,3761,I like the solid silver spinners.
230522,mepps,2008-07-21 11:33:00,1301,These   and mepps black fury with chartreuse dots
230562,buckster,2008-07-21 13:15:00,530,i had good luck with a vibrex pink body with a silver blade
230584,kemper,2008-07-21 14:16:00,2232,spinner baits?  or in line?   white white white white white for spinner baits with a silver blade   otherwise i think classic silver works best
230587,MuddyWater,2008-07-21 14:18:00,218,orange cant go wrong with an orange colour for some smallies. also when its getting to be evening chuck some big gold mepps everything likes big gold mepps
230595,Zib,2008-07-21 14:33:00,369,For spinnerbaits you can't go wrong with white.  For in-lines I've always done great with a plain Mepps in rainbow for SM bass. Plain silver also is a good choice. On cloudy days go with gold or copper.
230625,hoops12,2008-07-21 15:45:00,127,White....white....white....white
230697,Rich,2008-07-21 18:07:00,3927,"White with a gold blade, I don't know if I have any other colors! (if you're talking in-liners)"
230837,Garry2Rs,2008-07-21 22:45:00,1425,"The common wisdom is to use metal blades, silver or brass on sunny days, because the sun will make them flash.  On overcast days, painted blades will show-up better. White, white and chartreuse and chartreuse all resemble many types of bait fish.  I also like to have a Fire-Tiger spinnerbait in my collection.

230838,Angler16,2008-07-21 22:45:00,188,have em both already!haha but thanks
230841,PatrickGG,2008-07-21 23:00:00,562,Never mind Spinnerbaits throw some Tube Jigs.  But i suggest White and blue Spinnerbaits and be sure you throw a trailer hook on them.
230846,misfish,2008-07-21 23:19:00,29133,"Grab yerself some Vibra Fox #3 spinners in Chrome. Thats all I can offer up on this,as Nip is to far away to fish. I got all the water I need right here.LOL Have a great time and be safe."
230908,Greencoachdog,2008-07-22 01:42:00,8163,"Black and orange, white, firetiger, white, and red and white."
