Saturday morning/afternoon most of the guys are going to  Mooneys beach for some volleyball but 2 of us want to strike out and get in a few hours fishing instead.  So my question is - does anyone know somewhere relatively close to downtown (1 hour drive tops) that either has shore fishing or cheapish rentals that don't require prebooking.  The reason for the last criteria should be obvious - the stag starts Friday night and there's a very real chance we'll bail on the fishing Saturday morning .  Any tips would really be appreciated. Doesn't have to be anything fancy - a shot at some bass would be fine (not enough space to bring up the musky gear thats for sure).  I remember there being a small lake just a bit out of town with some bass in it but of course don't remember anything else about it  Thanks in advance Sean"

From the Ontario side, follow the bicycle path.  There's always people fishing there and you never know what you'll catch  Here is a link to it's location:  http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&q=vic...=1&ct=image  Hope this helps Tight lines and good luck Leechman"
230665,tbayboy,2008-07-21 17:16:00,1497,Thanks guys.  I've double checked with my buddy and he wants to get out on a boat and go bass fishing so any recommendations for any local lakes/rivers that rent boats and that are easy for a couple hung over guys not from the area and without GPS  to find?
230674,Charman,2008-07-21 17:31:00,5,"You should go to Hog's Back.  Just across the street from Mooney's.  Great shore fishing... lot's of smallmouth, walleye, and some Muskies too."
230681,RobHall,2008-07-21 17:41:00,261," Constance Lake is considered one of the best self producing lakes in all of Ontario.  At only 15 feet in depth it is abundant with Pike, Perch, Bass, Crappie and Catfish.  It is about 30-45 minutes from downtown Ottawa.     Contance Lake lodge (at the end of Contance Lake Rd) rents motor boats , row boats and canoes.  Constance Lake is easy to find as well.  Cheers,  FOTB "
230683,Charman,2008-07-21 17:42:00,5,"Just read your latest post.  I'd recommend Manotick Bait and Tacke.  They rent boats at a reasonable price and will point you toward the good fishing... largemouth, smallmouth, pike and muskie."
