I've never been up that late and was wondering how the weather might be. I assume pretty nice during the day and chilly at night. The lake is about an hour or so north of bellville. thx in advance."

Focus on weather patterns a week or two before you head up.  Smallmouths should be en route or already settled into their wintering areas regardless of temperatures.  They make their transition from summer areas to wintering holes relative to amount of daylight, not water temperature."
230891,tomO,2008-07-22 01:05:00,363,I was just wondering what the weather was normaly like that time of year.
230894,TennesseeGuy,2008-07-22 01:07:00,957,"I've missed only one October in the past 16 years.  It's a great time to fish NW Ontario.  Not the numbers, but size usually is better.  New moons and full moons have been good to me.  Drawback is that not many fishermen are around to exchange information.  Do it.  Weather won't matter, just go fishing."
