Apparently the pike come up there at a certain time of year.. I remember it being this time of year but guess I either missed it or was too early.  Anywho, with all the fallen logs and stumps in the river I decided to flip for bass while I was there. I stopped the boat (it was bright and sunny at this point) just to tie on a plastic lizard and by the time I was done rigging it it was cloudy as heck. The wind picked right up too. Odd, I thought.. where'd that come from?  Then suddenly Sugarpacket and I were stuck in a MAJOR storm that just blew up in like 5 minutes. WOW we got soaked, lightning hit trees not more than 500 feet from the shoreline. We hightailed it as soon as we heard thunder but wow, that was a scary experience. All this talk of storms thought I'd share my own story.  So we came home soaked and skunked! Haha.. better luck next time I guess."
230698,ccmtcanada,2008-07-21 18:08:00,7971,We're you shooting and episode?  Will be see it on your show????  Would make for some cool footage!  Glad you managed to get off the water safely!
230702,Rich,2008-07-21 18:11:00,3927,I wish! Was too worried about keeping the camera dry to pull it out in that downpour. I guess I could have fitted a plastic bag over it or something. Didn't really think of it til we got back to the launch. Dang.
230707,Cookslav,2008-07-21 18:15:00,1457,"Ya theres a few cells on the Radar that just kinda ""popped"" up moving Northwest to south east... Odd direction for this time of year, but thats weather in Ontario!"
230709,solopaddler,2008-07-21 18:20:00,8605,"  Not really odd at all..  Just arrived for my shift at the weather office at 2pm and 4mins later all hell broke loose. Wow is right, what a deluge!"
230712,Leecher,2008-07-21 18:23:00,7832, I'll second that.  Leechman
230912,Big Cliff,2008-07-22 01:51:00,6899," I don't know how much better luck you could hope for? You made it in safe didn't you!  Storm took down three trees at work today, one ended up right against our shop, good thing it wasn't 20' taller!"
