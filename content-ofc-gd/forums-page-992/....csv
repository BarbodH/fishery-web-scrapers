228628,nancur373,2008-07-16 22:23:00,1211,Will be getting my new-to-me boat on Sunday  http://peterborough.kijiji.ca:80/c-cars-ve...QQAdIdZ60840238
228665,Bass Tard,2008-07-16 23:56:00,128,"Will be getting mine in a couple of weeks!  17' Bass Tracker with a 50 horse Evinrude.  I'm so pumped, no more fishing out of tubes.  But no, you can't use it."
228829,cranks bait,2008-07-17 11:21:00,721,"Watcha lookin' fer there GCD?  I've been looking since April.  Cannot decide what I want.  So far I have a new motor and that is it.  All I can say about that is, holy crap what a difference, much more powerful, quieter and uses hardly any gas."
228832,ccmtcanada,2008-07-17 11:36:00,7971,Hey Glen....make it a minimalist trip for you.  Some chest waders and a float tube is all you need!  Don't forget the swim fins.  No need to trailer and good on gas.
228840,Mike the Pike,2008-07-17 11:59:00,3421,New boat whats that mine is 3 months old and has some new battle scars.Not new anymore.  Lets see daughters friend drove into the boat in the driveway  on a bicycle and left a nice 18 inch scratch in the hull.  I am not complaining about the gas with this boat which consumes less than $10 per day its pulling it with the van that costs $$$$$$$$$$$$$$  Besides some new scratches on the doc I am lovin it.  Problem is my boy is catching all the fish
228878,RobHall,2008-07-17 13:34:00,261," No new boat here, but i'm trying to win one.    If i win, i will bring it to lakeair in Sept and let you ""put it through it's paces"".  Cheers,  FOTB "
230806,nancur373,2008-07-21 20:58:00,1211,"Got her home last night. Will take more pics later. She's rough, old, and a little tired, but she floats."

230900,Daplumma,2008-07-22 01:14:00,1961,I have one you can borrow if you want.Not so good on gas but she runs pretty good in skinny water. Joe
230909,nancur373,2008-07-22 01:44:00,1211,I'm sure I'll get her back to form.
