230672,kuhaman,2008-07-21 17:23:00,503,I've stayed at Oakes cottages on lake Mindemoya a few times. The cottages are pretty nice and the walleye fishing can be fantastic. The lake itself is really clear so the best bite is usually just before dark. Hope this helps.  Mika

230764,swahrer,2008-07-21 19:47:00,28,"Hey Joe,  I have stayed at Mac's Camp & also Fred's Camp.  Both are on Lake Kagawong.  Lake has a ton of SM and apparently some big Pike & Jumbo Perch.  I personally only caught the SM's.  I didn't get a lot of time to fish but had a great time when I was out.  Both camp's are very close to each other but I would say Mac's camp was best for fishing out of.  Cabin's may be booked but they have camp sites for tent's or Trailers.  Worth a look.  http://www.manitoulin-island.com/macscamp/boating.htm  The lake is Beautiful with huge Lime Stone walls and shoals.  Lake looks tropical it is so clear and emerald green.  Have a great time!"
230772,Cudz,2008-07-21 19:57:00,2652,I used to go up there 20 years ago.  We stayed at mountainview resort (cottages).  Great smallmouth right in front of the cottage.  Great location on lake manitou.  Recommended http://www.mountainviewresort.ca/
