230381,mikeymikey,2008-07-20 23:52:00,376,that picture of you holding that smallmouth came out very unique/nice.
230455,Domi Fish,2008-07-21 02:23:00,46,Gotta love those highway 28 bass. Great pics.
230460,johnnyb,2008-07-21 02:35:00,3413,Awesome shot of that pike...nice bass pics too....from where I'm sitting [on the couch!]
230479,Garry2Rs,2008-07-21 03:53:00,1425,"Cory was responsible for the fancy photography, I just had to hold them...grin."
230512,danbo,2008-07-21 11:13:00,2646,"Good stuff,Garry..I'm jealous!"
230517,bushart,2008-07-21 11:26:00,2628,The one thing I know about Apsley is that I make sure I'm driving the speed limit when I'm 10 miles either side of it---not even 10km over---I've drove that route for 30 plus years and I'm pretty sure they get a new radar gun every year cause the last one wore out.

230518,Victor,2008-07-21 11:26:00,1609,Nice fish Garry.  Maybe I should strap my couch down onto my boat. That sounds like a great idea
230549,1leggedangler,2008-07-21 12:21:00,364,"Beauty report and love the underwater pic of the piker!!! Thanks.  Cheers, 1leg"
230558,Reef Runner,2008-07-21 13:02:00,980,Very respectable Bass there Garry.  Beautiful up your way.
230684,rpsmith,2008-07-21 17:45:00,28,Good looking bass!!!
230685,misfish,2008-07-21 17:48:00,29133," Yer not telling me Cory went bass fishing are ya    No way,he would ever do that."
230805,Cory,2008-07-21 20:58:00,170,"nope, never...that would be as crazy as fishing for carp."
230807,misfish,2008-07-21 20:59:00,29133,
230833,Garry2Rs,2008-07-21 22:30:00,1425,In the olden days Apsley was the home of the OPP radar school. Those days are gone and so is the radar school.
230850,bucktail,2008-07-21 23:41:00,1857,Was that pike in  Jacks???? Not good news if it was. Been a long time since I was at Jacks but pike in there is bad news for the Muskie population. Congrats on the good time tho!
230883,Garry2Rs,2008-07-22 00:54:00,1425,"No, the Pike wasn't in Jack's Lake."
230888,misfish,2008-07-22 01:00:00,29133, Was it tasty?
230941,Garry2Rs,2008-07-22 02:58:00,1425,I never took it out of the water.  Just grabbed the hook with the pliers and let it shake off at boat side.
