230197,pokerdemon4,2008-07-20 16:47:00,135,Way to go bill.  You deserve it. All your hard work has finally paid off.  Thanks for posting.
230979,lew,2008-07-22 08:17:00,12767,"WTG Bill, that's great news & congrats on your 1st ever musky.  You worked hard to get that girl and it's good to hear you enjoyed the experience so much.  I haven't been on the board much the last few weeks and missed this post entirely."
229290,BillM,2008-07-18 03:22:00,17367,"Finally finally FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!  Dad and I went out to Gloucester Pool tonight to try out my new rig (Shimano Calais 200 + St.Croix Avid 7"") on some smallmouth bass.  Didn't hit the bass like we have other nights, I think we got 4 in the boat and missed atleast that many..  On our way back we stopped at a new spot I knew had some nice structure..  First cast netted me a 3lb smallie, a few casts later a monster bass rocketed right out of the water, completely missed my bait but gave us a good show none the less..  A few casts later with my Zara Spook Jr and the water just erupts and my rod doubles over...  All hell breaks loose as I try to tighten the drag down because this fish is running like mad..  I get it tightened down and start to make some headway..  Maybe 30 seconds later after some bulldogging she comes to the surface for a big headshake..  I yell out ""HOLY IT'S A MUSKIE DAD!!!!!!!!!!!""  He starts to yell at me, ""Don't horse the wrong word thing!!!"" lol!!!  I get her coming towards the boat and one good scoop and she is in the net.  Not a monster by any means, but atleast a new PB for me.  We didn't get a measurement on her because I really wanted to get her back in the water, I would guess somewhere around 36"" or so and maybe 10-12lbs..  Gorgeous fish, no marks at all and extremely feisty.  Hooks popped out in the next, 2 quick pics with my cell phone (ugh, they turned out like crap) and back she went!  Here are some really crappy cell phone pics..  In the one pic she looks tiny for some reason   The other not to bad. Even with the crappy pics, I sure you can see the big eating grin I have on my face.  What a night!   "
229294,muskymike,2008-07-18 03:27:00,772,Finally Bill. Great job.  Okay we can officially hook up now. haha I had to wait until you broke the ice haha kidding.  Feels a lot better then washing those lures eh?
229296,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-18 03:27:00,2050,a hell of a way to test out the new combo Bill!  right on dude...
229298,BillM,2008-07-18 03:30:00,17367,"Yeah, quite a good test for the new rod and reel   My dad was teasing me pretty much all night about my virgin setup, lol..."
229302,Musky or Specks,2008-07-18 03:37:00,2710,Congrats welcome to the fraternity.
229307,woodee148,2008-07-18 03:43:00,14,Great fish!  and you can still see the grin thru the blur!!
229313,Raf,2008-07-18 04:06:00,3495,"uh-oh.. it's over dude  Sell the house, sell the car, sell the kids... you're never coming back."
229314,Master of Bait,2008-07-18 04:12:00,196,"Nice work!  I'm willing to bet you're going to start paying more attention to those toothy critters going forward!  Nothing like a highly desirable incidental.  Cheers,  MOB"
229368,bpsbassman,2008-07-18 11:33:00,941,Way to go Bill!!!! You got me excited just reading the post! And I know what you mean about the grin!!
229373,ccmtcanada,2008-07-18 11:42:00,7971,Hmmmmmmm.....I don't know....looks like a pike to me....  Just kidding...congrats!!! Must have been a fun ride!!!!
229376,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-18 11:48:00,1362,Welcome to the club Bill...  nice report and fish!
229393,Victor,2008-07-18 12:12:00,1609,"WTG Bill! Congrats on completing that 10,000 cast!  There's no better way to christen the new combo!  haha @ Cliff's comment."
229423,Reef Runner,2008-07-18 13:26:00,980,"So was the 10,000th cast?  Goes to show you, when ya want to catch a ski', do some bass fishing, lol.  Congrats on the Musky Bill. Know you've been on the hunt for a while.  Awsome story!"
229427,BillM,2008-07-18 13:31:00,17367,"I wish I actually caught it while musky fishing with all the new gear I've picked up in the last 6 months, but I'll take it any way I can.  My PB before this was all of 12 inches, lol..  I'll have to hit Balsam again soon, and maybe Pigeon.  I am itching to get some slime on my musky setups!"
229439,muskymike,2008-07-18 13:42:00,772,"Bill we should go explore the Moon River Delta. I have never fished it, only seen it from GBay. But its worth a shot."
229443,Leecher,2008-07-18 13:47:00,7832,Congratulation on your PB Bill Great report...... Thanks for sharing.  Leechman
229446,tbayboy,2008-07-18 13:53:00,1497,"Congrats Bill.  They sure are exciting fish especially when you don't expect one.  See you in 10,000 casts!"
229450,BillM,2008-07-18 13:57:00,17367," Yeah, I think the Moon/French River delta is probably one of the best places to pick up a giant.  I'm ready anytime, just let me know"
229456,limeyangler,2008-07-18 14:04:00,5204,"Thats just awesome, what a way to christen a new set up! WTG   (like Victor i also found Cliffs comment very amusing)"
229466,salmon,2008-07-18 14:21:00,334,Great job Bill I knew you would not wait until the weekend to get a workout on the reel and new rod. That reel is smooth eh? Also a good test for the drag on the reel. Keep the reports coming in.  Jose
229480,BillM,2008-07-18 14:50:00,17367,"Jose, this thing casts a mile..  Atleast an extra 20-30ft beyond my Citica..  Even with the 30lb braid and the small spook, zero problems."
229493,fishnsled,2008-07-18 15:41:00,3520,"No Cliff, it is a musky but it has been put in with photoshop.  A little less on the blur effect and I might have believed you Bill.   I guess it wouldn't count anyways because your were bass fishing  CONGRATS MAN!!!!  Nice to get that monkey off your back.      And yes, it counts!"
229495,steve_paul,2008-07-18 15:45:00,658,"Congrats Bill, good to see you break in the new set up like that."
229496,BillM,2008-07-18 15:48:00,17367,"Thanks guys!  While I was reeling it in, I think I said ""It's a musky, it's a musky!"" about 100 times  Even my oldman was pretty pumped up about it!  Now, to find that elusive 50incher"
230159,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-20 14:31:00,0,Congrats on your first Musky of the season! Those are weird pictures. Looks like 2 totally different Musky! Blurry pictures are better than no pictures!! Thanks for sharing!
