229992,TJQ,2008-07-19 23:00:00,7806,"These fish were caught up a very small creek... I took some video of it when I let it go...  I think its spazzing cause it was outta the water..  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
229993,Musky or Specks,2008-07-19 23:08:00,2710,"That video leads me to beleive that they are dogfish/bowfin they can use their swim bladder as lungs and frequently gulp air from the surface if they are low on O2.  The bowfin has a light covering of rounded, overlapping scales, a large mouth, and sharp teeth. Its swim bladder is capable of functioning as a lung, and the bowfin can survive out of water for a day. It prefers sluggish water and surfaces occasionally to gulp air."
229995,solopaddler,2008-07-19 23:19:00,8605,"I thought Bowfin myself initially.....but the lower fins are too long. Definitely more ""ling like"". If you check the lings life cylce, quite surprisingly (to me at least) it says they're also found in shallow streams."
229998,Musky or Specks,2008-07-19 23:24:00,2710,"I bleive ling are considered a coldwater species and the smaller shallow streams they are talking about are mountain tributaries. I could be wrong, but that behavior of gulping air from the surface is definately bowfin behavior. The pics are not the greatest quality as far as showing fins the profile photo looks like the fish is dried out some and the other photo show no features really. We see bowfin gulping on the surface like that all the time when we fish the Rankin System."
230001,TJQ,2008-07-19 23:46:00,7806,Here are a couple of other other views in hi res:      
230002,TJQ,2008-07-19 23:53:00,7806,Burbot perhaps.. (not to be confused with barbut.. lol)    http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...age/200074.html
230004,Spiel,2008-07-19 23:56:00,9065,"....Burbot, lawyer fish, ling whatever. A key identifier of the ling is the barbel under the chin which can be seen clearly in the video clip.    Yes they are usually a cold water fish and no I can't explain it's gulping behavior but it is a ling none the less."
230005,TJQ,2008-07-20 00:00:00,7806, Its not a ling.. its a burbot...  lol...   AKA northern pickerel hater
230006,solopaddler,2008-07-20 00:06:00,8605,"In Quebec they're called ""lush"".  Maybe a more appropriate handle?"
230043,wallyboss,2008-07-20 02:16:00,1095,"Solopaddler  the french word sounds like ""lush""  but it's ""loche"""
230084,solopaddler,2008-07-20 10:49:00,8605," I know, I know. But ""loche"" doesn't achieve the effect I was striving for  ."
230458,Moosebunk,2008-07-21 02:30:00,3970,"Great report TJ.  Tanker perch for sure.  For them trouts try a willowleaf about a foot above a hook and a worm and just drag it around real real real real real slow along steep shoreline points, deep structures and deep weededges, or any holes around the ole beaver lodge."
230526,Victor,2008-07-21 11:40:00,1609,"wow. what a perch. Nice report TJ.  Monique's been on fire eh! First she's got that HUGE pike, and then this. It might be a good idea to target walleye/pickerel/wall-ice next tiem!"
230568,ehg,2008-07-21 13:27:00,2666,"Exactly what i was going to say first the huge fat pike, now this massive perch! Great report, ehg"
230627,addy79,2008-07-21 15:49:00,573,"what a perch, looks a bit like a peacock bass!"
230659,modny,2008-07-21 17:01:00,502,yea those are lawyers  LUNKER perch
230673,wuchikubo,2008-07-21 17:23:00,1114," I'd have to agree with Spiel, the single barbel was clearly visible in the early portion of the video. Burbot or ""ling"" as some call it, it's one species on my list of fish to catch too.  Congrats to Monique on that huge perch."
229594,TJQ,2008-07-18 20:19:00,7806,"Monique and I got up to camp without the kids for 3 nites.  Got into a few back lakes and spent the first time up there without building anything, it was quite nice!    I took this picture... we barely got to camp before the skys opened up.    The bass were on for a couple of days.    I had a chance to do some underwater video.. not much success this time.    We managed to get to the boat I had put below the lower set of rapids... fishing is just as good as at camp!!  Not much water but Monique cleaned up.    She even let me catch a few.    We tried a new speck lake... um someones gonna have to show me how to fish them...  LOL..    The second lake we went to was GREAT in three hours we must have caught at least 20 decent pike and them the last fish was this... Moniques personal best perch, on a red/brass spoon.  We brought it back to camp, as she had never ate one before, so I cleaned it up and the fillets were just as big as a decent sized pickeral.  I honestly think its bigger than any perch I have ever caught.       heres another little pond on the way into camp, that I'm gonna have to get on...    The minnow traps were full of these guys... way up in the creeks.. I'm assuming its a ling... but I'm not sure.      A good time... bugs were fierce at nite and some more sun would have been nice, but hey what can ya do??"
229603,tibbs,2008-07-18 20:30:00,650,Great Report.... as Usual!  Wow that's a monster perch!
229606,steve_paul,2008-07-18 20:32:00,658,"geez that is one big honking perch, nice catch Monique"
229610,Joey,2008-07-18 20:41:00,9122,"Sweet report, it looks just gorgeous up there.  Nice fish, that's a huge perch, or was I should say  Joey"
229611,Reef Runner,2008-07-18 20:41:00,980,"Huge perch, very nice.  Glad the Mrs. let you get into some fish, lol.  I would think that 'minner to be a ling.  Awsome report TJ! The smiles say it all."
229646,Smokey,2008-07-18 21:53:00,1278,Great fish and Congrats on the adventures to the new lakes.  Mike
229649,wallyboss,2008-07-18 22:01:00,1095,HUGE PERCH!!!!!!!!  Congrats. Nice to be able to fillet a perch like that in the summer and not have it full of worms.  Thank god for Northern Ontario.  I going up there next week.  Sure looks like a ling to me.
229654,Greencoachdog,2008-07-18 22:04:00,8163,Excellent report and pics TJ!!!  That is a Killer Perch!!!
229659,Musky or Specks,2008-07-18 22:27:00,2710,Those are not ling the are mudminnows which are a very hardy minnow species. Looks very primitive like a ling or a bowfin. Nice perch.
229662,fishindevil,2008-07-18 22:30:00,6254,"Nice fishing tj !!!!..well it looks like your wife outfished you again !!!!.  ..she always gets the big ones too,nice pics too,great to get up there and spend time without the kids too,thanks for the report   cheers"
229693,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-18 23:29:00,2585,wow aweosme report! That is one huge perch!!!!  how long was that?  Cheers!
229696,Terry,2008-07-18 23:50:00,14456,nice perch  but I had to look twice at the pike in his avatar   
229708,PatrickGG,2008-07-19 00:23:00,562,"Nice Jumbo Perch must have been Tasty, Thanks for sharing the Pics and nice report."
229723,Handlebarz,2008-07-19 00:54:00,3790,Thanks boss now I gots a woodie and need to get rid of it. I just love the reprots from the north that place is amazing I hope you can get some help on the specks I am sorry I could not be of any help LOL.  Please keep them reports coming they are great
229746,Leecher,2008-07-19 01:37:00,7832,I call that a monster perch or perch on steroids....   that thing is huge  Good job Monique   the filets in the plate sure look yummy  Great report TJ and thanks for sharing.  Leechman
229772,Greencoachdog,2008-07-19 02:13:00,8163,  ...yeah!  ... like yer the only one!!!
229782,Musky or Specks,2008-07-19 02:37:00,2710,Help with specks. Once water temps warm up. I find using leadcore line works the best. I try to find flats in the 25-30 foot range next to structure like points and humps. generally 4 colours seems to put you in the fishes range.
229791,Cookslav,2008-07-19 03:09:00,1457,"Cripes thats a beauty Perch!!!  I'm soooo envious of that camp The Type of lake would dictate how I approach those specs I think... I find it makes a difference in the how they feed...especailly once its hot  If its a kettle, or spring based lake, I'd bet the water temps will remain a constant cool...so I'd bet you'd hammer them in shallow cover. Logs along shore in 6' + of water is what I would Target primarily with the usual small spinners(blue fox, Mepps etc), or small Rapalas But....if you can get ahold of some crawfish, leeches or minnows I'd give them a run.  If its a steam or Tributary fed lake I'd take Musky or specs advice fer sure....shoals, and any ""big rocks"" that cast shade in deeper waters. But... Thats Just my $0.02  Cheers,"
229840,solopaddler,2008-07-19 12:16:00,8605,"Beautiful shot of the river, looks like nice water! There should be some decent walleye in that current... Nice perch as well! Not sure about the species I.D. without doing some research but I'm pretty positive it's not a mudminnow. Unless it's a sub species I've never encountered. My first thought was juvenile Bowfin, but I don't think the lower fins are correct for that..  Cheers"
229845,oxcowboy,2008-07-19 12:47:00,544,"wow thats a nice perch, congrats on another successful trip at jiggy.  glad you got to get up there and just relax for a change.  jason"
229848,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-19 12:59:00,1362,great report and what a NICE perch!!...congrats to the wife for the PB
229851,ccmtcanada,2008-07-19 13:04:00,7971,"There's something about your reports this year that's different.....I can't quite put my finger on it.  Oh yeah!! There's lots of fish pics!!  Monique still kicks your butt as usual, but it's good to see you get into a few too.  That's a sweet pike and a massive perch!  Great report TJ....glad to see you taking full advantage of Camp Jiggy Jiggy as much as you are this year."
229900,Spiel,2008-07-19 15:30:00,9065,"....Right on, another good report from Jiggy Jiggy. The fish in question is definitely a ling"
229949,TJQ,2008-07-19 19:09:00,7806,Thanks for the advice guys!!  Ill likely give it another shot!!
229959,Musky or Specks,2008-07-19 20:06:00,2710,"I dont think so shallow open water thats probably warm is not ling habitat.  If its not a mudminnow it might be yoy( young of the year) bowfin  Something I found about young freshwater burbot  What is their life cycle? Burbot lay their eggs in the middle of winter under the ice, generally in January or February. They spawn at night in shallow water over sand or gravel. They do not make a nest - the eggs just drop to the bottom of the lake in shallow water. The eggs hatch after about thirty days and the young fish move into deeper water. Burbot have been known to live up to 20 years but most do not live more than a decade."
