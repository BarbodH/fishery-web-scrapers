229968,GoneFishin,2008-07-19 21:06:00,349,I've been wondering the same thing! I would love to enter a bass fishing derby but wouldn't be able to keep up with pro's lol. I tried to search for some but couldn't find what I was looking for. If any one knows any that would be awsome.
229970,misfish,2008-07-19 21:11:00,29133,I dont think you will find to many without one or two pros fishing. The season is short and tourneys are limited.  There is the Toonie tourney.
229986,vance,2008-07-19 22:38:00,719,Although it is more than 2 hours away this is a nice amature tournement that some of us from oshawa have been going in for about 8 years.If you want more details just ask. http://www.minnehahacamp.com/bass.html   vance
229996,aniceguy,2008-07-19 23:21:00,1094,Join a local bass club for $60 generally.  Then fish the club torunaments some are low key 10 boats or so some like the one I fished today are 20 plus boats.  Usually the fees as a non boater are $40 or so to fish the tourny $50 as a non boater fee to the boater for gas and your good to go.  Cant get much lower key then that where you can fish off a bass boat. two sites http://www.goldenhorseshoebassanglers.ca/phpBB2/index.php and http://www.bigfatbass.com/index.php

230035,Mark Kulik,2008-07-20 01:34:00,348,Nice guy has the best advice-trust me it can be a tough learning curve on your own-with a club its inexpensive and you can go as a non-boater-check out the Canadian Bass anglers federation or Downtown Bass anglers out of Oshawa-great bunch of guys more than willing to teach-pm me if you need more info-Mark
230080,Guest skeeter99,2008-07-20 10:32:00,0,"you give them to much credit  i have fished 27 bass tournaments  I have 1 win 2 3rd's  and my worst tournament I finished 31 and the average tournament has about 80 boats  just this year in 2 tournaments I have a 18 and 23 place finish, and I only fish about 3 to 4 times a week and by no means a professional  the last tournament 2 guys who I did not even know with a 16 foot bassboat with a 115hp weighed in over 20 pounds to beat the **pros**  remember fishing is a individual sport and it is more mental tougness than you think you fish hard non stop for 8 hours, thinking every cast you will get a fish  and here is something to think about !!were do they go to eat after the day of fishing **MCDONALDS JUST LIKE YOU**"
230116,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-20 12:43:00,0," Local bass club for $60? The local bass club here is over $300!! Is Big Fat Bass a bass club???  I am sceptical about joining a bass club, now that my partner is ill, but for $60?? Will definitely consider it! Any around Toronto(North York)?  I asked a few friends. Does anyone know the number of The Bass Pro shop bass club run by David Chong?"
230188,aniceguy,2008-07-20 16:21:00,1094,JB both of those sites have sections that list the local clubs....$300.00 I havent heard that one as of yet... One other point to mention....most of the clubs are usually looking for non boaters to fish....getting on a boat with someone who knows what they are doing makes the curve easier....and to top it off can even put money in your pocket
230202,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-20 17:03:00,0, Mega city bassmasters. Well over $300 for the first year and then $200 or so every following year. Don't know what that includes.  I have a boat but I have no problems getting on someone else's boat. As long as they are not burning hundreds of dollars of gas on the boat a day........  I am getting all the information now. We will see what happens...
230243,GBW,2008-07-20 18:58:00,8460,"check out cbaf.ca and you will find the BPS chapter info there.  Yes, it is only $65.00 a year to join too.  As a non-boater for the events myself it's a great deal when you look at at.  I just with it was Aug 10th already...  HAHA"
230253,misfish,2008-07-20 19:32:00,29133, Whys that?  Great members at the BPS Chapter.
230374,fishindevil,2008-07-20 23:36:00,6254,"Hey maybe we should have our own bass club the ""OFC BASS CHAPTER""   OFC WALLEYE CHAPTER  OFC MUSKIE CHAPTER   OFC SALMON CHAPTER    why not,then once a month we have a meeting,and the meetings could be rotated around the ""GTA"" so that everyone has a chance to go  !!!!!!....what do ya think ??????"
230392,Stoty,2008-07-21 00:30:00,2910,"Fishing against pros in big bass boats doesn't matter. My buddy and I fished a tourney on Rice Lake back 3-4 years ago in his 16 ft, with a 30 HP and finished in the top 20. we beat quite a few pros, one who had a 21ft bass boat with a 225, and his own TV show!  Just because you aren't a ""pro"" doesn't mean you cant compete with them."
230481,GBW,2008-07-21 03:55:00,8460,"why, because it's an event day that I am looking forward to! yes, all the members are great and are willing to help each other out as well as others any day of the week."
