230395,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-21 00:33:00,0,"Ya great report.lol We stung all the big ones on our last trip! Caught lots of little guys and rockbass, perch and crappie. Jeff lost a little pickerel at the boat too. Tried for a few hours for Musky but it was a no go..Didn't even see one.  There is something really stinky in Scugog! The farmers must be using some very powerful fertilizer!  Oh ya! And that big one Jeff caught? It attacked my bait and Jeff stole my fish.lol!!!  Another great day on the bog."
230399,cpguy29,2008-07-21 00:44:00,148,  Hopefully that stink will be gone after todays rain. Sorry about the stolen fish but after losing that pickeral and a few bass I was getting desperate...LOL
