230029,Mike01,2008-07-20 01:14:00,378,Most bass fishing takes place in central Florida.  However I'm sure there are still plenty of bass in the panhandle.  Have you considered any saltwater fishing?  I'll poke around a bit and see what I can find out.

230044,Greencoachdog,2008-07-20 02:17:00,8163,"Bass fishing is open year 'round in Florida!  The Dead Lakes (actually 1 lake) near Wewahitchka will be your best bet for BIG Bass in the Panama City area. It is a Cypress stump swamp. The most effective way to fish it is with a 20' long cane pole rigged with 25 lb. test mono a large bobber and a 6-12"" live Golden Shiner. Drop the live Shiner at every stump you see, if no bite in 1 minute... move to another stump. A 5-15 lb. Bass is a helluva fight on a 20' cane pole. Hire a guide if you can for the first day.  Wewa is about a 45 min-1 hr. drive from P.C.  If I was you, I'd charter an inshore saltwater trip for Bull Redfish and Saltwater Sheepshead (Convict Fish). The Red (fish) and Black drum will rip your shoulders out of the socket and there isn't any finer eating than the Sheepshead (different from fresh water). The Bull Reds will definately be running at that time of year.  Deep sea isn't worth the time at that time of year because Red Snapper and Grouper seasons are closed.  If you need anymore info you can PM me.  Dead Lakes: http://www.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?ar...ELK&CU_ID=1   btw... this is the size of the Redfish you can catch down there from shore and small boats in the Fall and winter:   The fish in the foreground are Sheepshead (Convict Fish)"
230355,huntervasili,2008-07-20 22:57:00,1604,"Yup, redfish is a hell of alot of fun. Aswell basically any Pier you find, especially by breakwalls has lots of fish... fish for them with a 1/4-1/2 oz egg sinker abover a swivel with a 1ft heavy (25lb+) leader with some fresh dead shrimp which have been peeled... toss it and leave it anywhere by the pier and you should have some luck... we got upwards of 6 species of fish around 5lb's and up doing that. Lots of fun. Good luck to you!"

I did go to Panama City for a Spring Break weekend back when I was 18... ended up leaving 3 years later!... can you say PARTY!!!   ... finally sobered up enough to find my way back home..."
