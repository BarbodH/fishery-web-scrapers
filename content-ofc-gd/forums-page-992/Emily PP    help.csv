230658,bow slayer,2008-07-21 17:00:00,1074,Looks like I will be camping there this weekend. If anyone has some info on the park please share. I will be camping at either site 43 or 39 . How is this area for privacy and trees? I also plan on bringing the boat. Can you dock them in the park or do you have pull them out.  As for fishing any tips would be appreciated as in where from the park waters for different species.  thanks for any replies.
