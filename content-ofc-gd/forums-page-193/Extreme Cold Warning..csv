896401,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-06 15:35:00,10439,"Unlike back East they don't issue a cold weather warning @ -15C. If they did we would be under one from October to April!!! They wait for it to get a little colder here in the North country before one is issued. OK, a lot colder!!! Like 35* colder!!! They don't issue one until it hits -50C ambient or windchill. So if you think it's cold there, it really isn't.  "

896410,solopaddler,2015-02-06 16:37:00,8605,I sincerely hope you're right and the temps will be warmer in early April. Otherwise I foresee little fishing and plenty of rum consumption.
896411,Terry,2015-02-06 16:40:00,14456,Cold temp warning  Yeah but you don't have all the homeless people. Sleeping on the street  like we have down here  Well not anymore with temps like that
896415,manjo39,2015-02-06 17:10:00,354,How do your eyeballs not freeze in temps like that?
896420,Fisherman,2015-02-06 17:16:00,7201,"Well I can tell ya, living in a tent at -50, we each had 2 burner coleman stoves with 2 tanks, one burning, one refilled and ready to go.  At 1 hour and 55 minutes you put the refilled tank very close to the side burner and heat the naphtha, otherwise on flame out, the second tank wouldn't light up.  That's on top of a coleman lantern and an alladin blue flame heater going.  Did we have tent eye.. Regular motor oil was stiff, like solid.  I had a trailer tire that was completely deflated but didn't go down, that's how stiff the rubber was.  And these weiners whine at -15."
896423,Fisherman,2015-02-06 17:18:00,7201,"How do your eyeballs not freeze in temps like that? I can tell ya what does freeze,  you can just about whizz icecikles, never mind going for a #2."

896437,jimmer,2015-02-06 18:40:00,2730,I was just going to ask how one would take a leak. Never mind finding the little bugger in that cold.
896542,wormdunker,2015-02-07 09:23:00,1711,Sounds like Fort McMurray.  Cold as hell.  Last year -35C & -40 was normal!  Upper management did shut the job down one day at -54C!  This year - I'm not sure - I'm sitting at home waiting for the oil prices to rise.  Come on guys - buy more gas & heating oil!!  LOL!
896568,mr blizzard,2015-02-07 15:56:00,1589,"Went out for my mile and a half walk yesterday had to pry off the belaclava a little firm it was but refreshing, wish I could download pics on this thing  And dave u forgot we never have school bus cancellations or school closures.  A couple of years ago when our son was in school still some of his friends did not initially believe us that they had school closure days down south  not just for the snow but the cold.  The high schools dont have busing for them .  Just the public schools"
896570,Joey,2015-02-07 16:05:00,9122,"I lived in Flin Flon, Manitoba for grades 3 and 4 and we had to walk to school in -50. Mom used to make me wear a skidoo suit and then I'd wrap a scarf around the hood of it over my face.   You could see through the scarf a bit, enough to walk anyhow.  And yes, it was up hill both ways"
896577,lew,2015-02-07 16:40:00,12766,"  And yes, it was up hill both ways  And don't forget you were barefoot too Joey"
