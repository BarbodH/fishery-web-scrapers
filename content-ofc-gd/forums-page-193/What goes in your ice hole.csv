I had just picked up a new UL St-Croix ice stick and had set it up with a nice lively minner in the first hole..  Started jigging the second hole and I look back and the rod is off the holder, sitting on the ice..  I put my rod down, and proceed to walk over to the other rod..  About half way to the first hole, the rod kind of did a stand-up and went ploop, down the hole!!  After a few colourful remarks, I walk over to the second hole and start jigging again..  I feel a bite, set the hook and whatya know, I had hooked the bail of the reel of the new UL set-up with my tube!   And as luck would have it... the fish was still on the line!  I proceed to play the fish and managed to land a beauty splake!!  Pretty flukey, eh?!"

During the fall pickerel bite this year a couple of guys saw us start catching and of course encroached right in on us. it was to our satisfaction that 10 minutes later the guy dropped his rod in the lake and it was gone. Unfortunately for us he accidentally snagged it a short time later, however the icing on the cake was when i reeled in a 9lber while they remained skunked for the day  Perhaps my all time favorite was when my pops was trying to park the 27 footer and a gust of wind threw my mom in the lake. no ice on for that one, would have been funnier if there was!"

Watching a guy heave his guts out leaning over a hole is hilarious until you realize puke don't sink, now that's what I call chumming.  The best thing that went overboard. Out on the boat with a free spirited young women 35 years ago. She decided she should sun bathe and didn't want tan lines. She put her stuffin a beach bag, all her clothes, and when she wasn't looking I put the bag in a dry livewell and told her the bag must have blown overboard the last time we moved the boat.

I grab the phone, but it says it is too cold. So naturally i throw it down the front of my bib to warm up and keep fishing.  After a while I reach back to grab a bag of chips out of my bag behind me, the phone slips out of my bib, takes a weird hop and proceeds to slide 4 feet across the ice like a golf putt, right into my hole.

I was fishing on a party boat in Florida about 20 years ago, having a super time and there was a pot for the biggest fish (a few hundred bucks). I hooked into a really nice grouper, it was easily the biggest fish of the day and putting up a great fight when suddenly my $400.00+ gold bracelet came undone and dropped into the ocean. Minutes later I lost the fish and let out a string of (not suitable for younger ears words). The guy beside me just looked at me and said ""you got more upset about loosing that fish than you did about your bracelet""! I replied that the bracelet was insured, the fish wasn't!"

895615,akaShag,2015-02-02 16:29:00,2073,"Buddy of mine won a REALLY nice spinning reel in an ice derby.  Next time we were on the ice he decided to swap the spool he had on for one with a different line on it, ie heavier or lighter, I forget which.  He starts taking the front drag disc off the reel (which holds the spool in place.)  I tell him, ""Phil, you want to move away from your hole so you don't drop that down the hole.""  He looks at me, says, ""No way"" or something similar, then plop, roll, plunk, down goes his reel part straight down the hole.........  I MAY have said, ""I TOLD YOU SO.""  Years ago, fishing out of commercial ice huts on Simcoe, we snagged several items including a hole skimmer and a Coleman lantern.  They were the old style huts with one gigantic hole in the centre of the hut, and I understand it was common practice for anglers to enjoy a few wobbly pops out in the shacks....   The operator said there was any amount of stuff down there including minnow buckets, rods and reels, etc.  Cell phones did not exist at that time, so there were none of those........  Yet another time out on Simcoe, over Beaverton way about 1983 or so, there was a hut operator who was a pretty tough chap, seems to me he had been in combat and had caught a bullet in the teeth (and lived).  Anyways, at the end of the day he came out to pick us up with his sled, and there was blood all over the place.  what the hell?  When we asked him about the blood, he told us the group that was out near us were a bunch of gay men (we already knew that since one of them propositioned my buddy on the way out that morning) and anyways when he went to check on them, they were in the shack buck naked, smoking dope.  One guy jumped down the ice hole and was sinking, when the hut operator grabbed the gaff and gaffed him through his cheek to pull him back into the shack.  So although I did not SEE the guy dropping down the ice hole, I am thinking that is the oddest ""item"" I ever heard of going down a hole.  And I am here to tell you, a gaff wound to a cheek leaves a lot of blood.  Doug"
895617,ketchenany,2015-02-02 16:40:00,3229,Many years ago on Simcoe the operator wanted a deposit for any beer yes beer that went out on the ice. IF any tootle or cap was missing tou lost the deposit! Well I dropped a cap in the hole. I always carry a magnet with me so down it went and sure enough I got it back with much luck and trials. From then on I always carried an spare cap just in case. On Nip we were given the third degree on dropping anything down. I picked up almost all of his utensils during the night. he had very few words to say in the morning.

He pulls it out of his camera bag and as he turns, he bumps the frame holding the bunks in place and then this caused his camera to slip out of his hands. That bounced several times before it went ""plunk"" down the hole it goes. We even saw the splash of the water! Everyone was speachless and I remember buddy saying...""Oh my wife is gonna $#@#$%$ kill me!""  On Sunday as we were packing up, we were all chuckling about his mishap and then something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. I take a second look and low and behold, there it is,,,, buddies brand new camera just a mere inch away from the hole. It didn't go down after all!

This of course caused the shanty to collapse on us and we barely had a clue what just happened....it wasn't until we looked into the holes and noticed we each had a half of the pole at the bottom before we realized.  The shanty was basically useless after that, i have fixed it with a pc of dowel in place of the poles but it just isn't the same...."
