894577,fishnsled,2015-01-27 22:23:00,3520,A great ready as always Bunk! Pretty damn funny! #prostaff #mustjoin.    Thanks for putting that together.
894578,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-27 22:27:00,8243,"You just can't keep a Viking Warrior from landing a beauty blond Mermaid. You got me on that one. What's the best way to handle a blond as to not harm them when you handle her?  A great report Bunk and very refreshing, no same old same old from Bunk. Reading your early prose out load I swear I'm back visiting at Sydney Steel in the 80's. There was a transplanted Irishman at the plant who's favorite saying was "" Me can't says fer sure but I heerd it."" Classic.  I have always enjoyed your Winter pics. What camera are you using if I may ask Bunk?  Please see PM.  Thanks for the great read and see.  Johnny D"
894620,Moosebunk,2015-01-28 01:26:00,3970,"Been here before, but....  Got to a computer that would let me watch that.  Had seen it, still funny.  As someone who has targeted splake multiple times with zero success I tip my hat to you.  Splake are my nemesis.  You have no idea.  Funny but, I would go to this lake from time to time and probably a half dozen or more over the years.  Never a fish.  This fall I was kinda sorta guiding an American friend here for 4 days, take him to the lake so he can try for his first splake and of course... he bangs a 21.5 incher.  Catching a few this time around, that really is because of the backwoods trout knowledge my buddy Mike has.  He's ""Pro"" and always has been.  Noice one Bunk!  But thanking China...  wouldn't that be, as the Brits so adeptly put it...  taking the piss?!?!  Is that how they put it?  Didn't know.  But I could see those stuffy teapot, banger and mash munchers saying something like that.  What's the best way to handle a blond as to not harm them when you handle her?  I have always enjoyed your Winter pics. What camera are you using if I may ask Bunk?  Please see PM. Johnny D  Wondering if there's a punch-line a coming to handling blondes or, if you're asking John?  Camera most often used now is a Nikon D40X but, still use the Lumix plenty too."
894658,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 09:14:00,8243,"I was told not to lip them. Can I say that here? That's pushing bad taste for sure. Both cameras are beautiful tools from what I read, You get what you pay for. Nice, but not in the budget"

894201,porkpie,2015-01-26 00:37:00,2521,"You need to change names from a handle to you real name so you can get your name out there, gain lots of followers, then start pimping lure lodges and gear.  Once all this happens, you will eventually get yourself in a few magazines.  This is the sure road to success these days.  It can't happen until you lose the handle though dude, you heard it here first!  I'm just going to step out and pick up some duct tape now!"
894203,Terry,2015-01-26 00:57:00,14456,great report  you have to know he mounted the one

894205,Gallie,2015-01-26 01:07:00,1215,"Hahaha, bunk you are a wordsmith if there ever was one, wonderful fun as always. If you ever have to give up fishing you could always write books?"
