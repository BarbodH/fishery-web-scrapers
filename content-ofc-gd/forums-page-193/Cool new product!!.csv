895824,bare foot wader,2015-02-03 21:55:00,1354,"definitely sounds cool but not sure how practical it would be, since my iphone sucks in the cold  are they making heated iphone cases yet lol"
895829,Spiel,2015-02-03 22:07:00,9065,"Cool, it would seem so.  But personally I'd rather leave my expensive phone safely stored away from a hole in the ice. The dedicated sonar I have is always in view, doesn't require me to hold it to see it nor is near said open ice hole because it stands alone and can't fall through said hole!"
895831,Terry,2015-02-03 22:18:00,14456,"transducers  work better  when put near the bottom of the ice, that doesn't  every limited  power lag time sending to phone running an app all day long on your phone  I see no up side to this thing"
895835,Fishwilly,2015-02-03 22:56:00,206,Have to agree about product shortcomings and limitations.....however that unit he used to pull his sled around is pretty cool. Anyone know what it is?
895836,akaShag,2015-02-03 22:56:00,2073,back to Terry.....  ......the upside was the guy who wrote the ad getting some practice with his Engrish........  Doug

895842,pics,2015-02-03 23:30:00,1268,This certainly wouldn't do well with thick ice.. I think it might be worth maybe $100 but not 300.. it will sell well with the tech set...
895846,akaShag,2015-02-03 23:34:00,2073,that sled:  Google Yvon Martel MIT-136 and you'll find it.  Doug
895847,Fishwilly,2015-02-03 23:35:00,206," pretty sure it was posted here last year, remember seeing it, French Canadian guy Found this but not the same device. The one in the Deeper video has enclosed track and the guy loads his gear on top. Very cool.  http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/18/mtt-136-electric-treaded-tank-sled/"

That's what I was thinking.  If it was under a $100 it would be an cheap alternative to a regular sonar.  For $300 I would rather buy a portable graph.
895886,SirCranksalot,2015-02-04 03:26:00,3291,back to Terry.....  ......the upside was the guy who wrote the ad getting some practice with his Engrish........  Doug  If that's the case he will be overqualified to write the users' manual!!
895889,irishfield,2015-02-04 03:45:00,26272,>> and that's something coming from Terry.... as he has every other gadget known to man!!
895901,Terry,2015-02-04 10:06:00,14456,lol  but I was thinking  if it works (somewhat) it might be cool to use it for a tipup that is  out from where you are set up   depending on how far the bluetooth goes you could see your lure 50 ft away  while you sit at the other hole jigging
895951,Raycaster,2015-02-04 16:05:00,528,Not trying to promote products (unless I get a cut!!!) but this has been available for awhile and works with Navionics already and is cheaper. Not a super high end scanner ( no side scan/chirp etc and not sure about depth max) but...  http://www.sonarphone.mobi/navionics  I like the idea of people at back of boat also being able to check depth/fish etc. from their phone or tablet. Everyone on boat can login to the device to view info.
895964,Headhunter,2015-02-04 16:41:00,5703,"Phones should be left on shore and outta reach... isn't that one of the reasons we all enjoy the sport, to get away from day to day? HH"
895974,mistaredone,2015-02-04 17:02:00,913,I never understood why navionics haven't cut out the middle man. A lot of people have smart phones and tabs that are probably a lot more powerful than a 3 grand unit and unlimited potential. Seems like the only way to go to me?
