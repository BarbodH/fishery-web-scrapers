895869,Loonietoon,2015-02-04 01:37:00,1450,Awesome news cabelas just started to carry handlebarz woohoo. Way to go Mike.. no more truck driving soon
895892,AdamS,2015-02-04 05:04:00,161,"  No deals anymore and when you figure in entrance fees, parking, food and beverage you payed more then double for anything you bought there.  And now with Cabela's in the area why bother to go and pay to see the same stuff Cabela's has everyday on their shelves. There's a coupon on the website and parking is free so your looking at a whopping $13 if you eat before you go. I'm not that close to a cabela's or bass pro, plus it's good to get out and support local companies, get info from manufacturers, meet the pro's, and be around a bunch of people with the similar interests."
896250,mosquito,2015-02-05 23:12:00,111,"For those going, how about a bit of incentive.  http://springfishingandboatshow.com/?page_id=2 "
896253,Christopheraaron,2015-02-05 23:40:00,3525,"I'm going to be bringing a bunch of fly rods too, if anyone wants a casting or tying lesson I'm more happy to help and there are some truly amazing casters in the club too."
896296,Handlebarz,2015-02-06 01:44:00,3790,Hey all I have had a bunch of emails and a couple phone calls about my comment on getting into cabalas. I was joking in my response to another comment about their store having all the same gear as what will be at the fishing and boat show.  Now when we do get into cabalas I will let ya all know.  Looking forward to next weekend.
894084,Handlebarz,2015-01-25 14:25:00,3790,I went to the Spring Show in 09 intending to pick up a couple musky baits but came home with a new Skeeter instead.  The day cost me a tad more than I planned on spending Lew just think of the memories that your skeeter has brought and the new name you went from Rainbow Lew to Skeeter LOL and not to mention I see a lot of smiles from the old boat. Are you going to get down to the show?
894086,lew,2015-01-25 14:34:00,12766,"you went from Rainbow Lew  I still laugh every time I think of the nasty nasty PM I received after making that post, that was some really funny stuff Mike  No, I won't be going to the show this year, I don't fish much  anymore and don't use even a fraction of the gear I have now.  Maybe it's time for a garage sale LOL"
894095,Pigeontroller,2015-01-25 14:48:00,2793,"It would be nice to see you Sunday morning Lew, its a whos-who of the Muskie world, and your smiling face should be there!"
894099,grizzlybri,2015-01-25 14:56:00,565,"Someone owes me a free pass.  LOL  2 out of the last 3 years (for the sportsman show) I've gotten free passes, to bad my friend I got them from each time seems to have vanished"
894103,lew,2015-01-25 15:13:00,12766,"It would be nice to see you Sunday morning Lew, its a whos-who of the Muskie world, and your smiling face should be there!  Thanks Dax, it's definitely a great day but I don't think I've been to the show since I moved up here 5 years ago."
894172,Handlebarz,2015-01-25 21:58:00,3790,If I can get some passes I will post a quick contest here for them
894197,Christopheraaron,2015-01-26 00:10:00,3525, Maybe it's time for a garage sale LOL Please let me know when that is happening!
894319,BucktownAngler,2015-01-26 19:37:00,582,is there somewhere where it shows what vendors will have booths at the show?  i tried the website http://springfishingandboatshow.com/ but no luck

895519,Acountdeleted,2015-02-01 23:47:00,2562,I'll be going to this one and passing on the sportsman show. The distance and free parking has sold me.
895520,SirCranksalot,2015-02-01 23:55:00,3291,. The distance and free parking has sold me.   Maybe you can pay the downtown parking in monthly installments!?
895533,Acountdeleted,2015-02-02 01:01:00,2562,Are you kidding? I don't pay that much on the car.
895535,grizzlybri,2015-02-02 01:40:00,565,Well I know I'll be going to the Spring fishing show and the Bass Pro spring fishing classic which starts next week

895780,Handlebarz,2015-02-03 18:26:00,3790,Awesome news cabelas just started to carry handlebarz woohoo.
895784,BillM,2015-02-03 18:44:00,17367,"Is this going to be another thread where guys constantly complain about prices and how it's not like it was in the 80's?  Reality check folks, it's NEVER going to be like that again, get over it, lol.  I love going to the fishing show, and I rarely ever spend $$$ on tackle there."
895807,outllaw,2015-02-03 21:00:00,1232,"guys shows in winter are a great break from canuck winters. as for products. normally the new and latest styles and colors appear. as for pricing on products ,please remember lure builders are hostages also. parts/pieces go up every day. when canadien dollars fall parts are more expensive.smaller and custom builders have a love,cause it certainly isn't buying them a better cut of beef for the table.."
895830,Meegs,2015-02-03 22:11:00,249,I'll be in a booth with impact baits.  I'm only going to be there myself on the Friday and Sunday.

893650,Christopheraaron,2015-01-23 04:24:00,3525,"I'll be there tying, should be fun!"
893655,Handlebarz,2015-01-23 08:59:00,3790,I just booked a booth for the show last night when talking to Andy he said that their are alot more fishing related booths and not all the filler stuff that they had in the past.  Be sure to stop by the booth we will be across from the Muskies Canada booth along with beaver lures and another musky booth.  I can't wait to actually have time to get caught up with many Ofc members. Chits I hope your not sick this year.
893743,captpierre,2015-01-23 22:28:00,2521,Will be there. I can spend the $100 normally spent at the boat show.  Tickets. Parking. Food. That'll buy a Symmetry on sale Yippie!
893744,JoshS,2015-01-23 22:40:00,729,I'll probably check it out...

893772,mistaredone,2015-01-24 01:01:00,913,I hope to make it this year. I do need a bumper board
893778,SirCranksalot,2015-01-24 01:19:00,3291,"That's the one out near the airport rather than the one at the CNE, right? Holy cow---the CNE---what a crappy location for a show! Getting there is definitely not 1/2 the fun!!"
893785,FloatnFly,2015-01-24 01:54:00,1640,was thinking about checking this show out! the outdoorsman show is gettin old
893787,grizzlybri,2015-01-24 02:03:00,565,"was thinking about checking this show out! the outdoorsman show is gettin old  I agree, and with the sportsman show just hasn't been as nice since they moved to the CNE, So I'll most likely be at the show"
893797,John Bacon,2015-01-24 03:20:00,3277," I agree, and with the sportsman show just hasn't been as nice since they moved to the CNE, So I'll most likely be at the show  Do you mean back to the CNE?  There have only been 2 or 3 out of the last 30 or so years that they were not at the CNE."
893806,Roy,2015-01-24 05:48:00,13728,"I was at the Sportsmens' Show at the CNE 54 years ago. What a great time that was for me. It still was a great time for many years after that.  Now, I prefer the truly Outdoors shows. The Spring Fishing Show, in my opinion is a far better show. Just sayin'. The smaller swap shows are nice too."

Lucky for me and my brothers,he caught her and we got to enjoy many young years attending the show and was able to take my boys to it.."
893814,Handlebarz,2015-01-24 10:52:00,3790,This year Muskies Canada have brought back some awesome speakers for musky Sunday including Marc Thorp Big Jim James Linder Gord Pyzer. If you have not heard these guys talking about musky do yourself a favor and get out for it Marc was there last year and he stole the show I loved the biology talk and the stuff about releasing musky was awesome as I could picture musky acting just like he was talking about I saw many others nodding their heads in agreement with his findings on swim bladder. He is worrth the trip alone
893829,Pigeontroller,2015-01-24 13:39:00,2793,"We will be having an amazing Silent Auction Sunday morning along with the Speakers! Guided trips, Custom Baits, etc."
