895728,c10,2015-02-03 06:53:00,131,"Yea I just saw this on Facebook as well! certainly something I am going include in my budget when I get a quad or sled! It is expensive, but I don't think you can really put a price on safety... metaphorically speaking lol.  Thanks for sharing though eh"

895730,Terry,2015-02-03 10:41:00,14456,I was checking that out on the weekend it is a great idea in their video  the atv is totally underwater  but not far down and the thing acts as a raft for people to get on
895761,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-03 16:19:00,10439,"Yep, a lot easier to recover than from 200' down."
895766,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-03 16:48:00,8243,"I don't sled but it looks like a great idea and would have one on a sled or ATV, can they be used on a ATV?  . My only question would be that would the air bag be able to push through big slabs of ice to come to the surface. I see where machines have gone down and a huge hole isn't created sometimes and the slabs of ice basically cover where it want down."
