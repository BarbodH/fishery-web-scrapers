Best approach if you don't have a factory service manual is to have a mech diagnose the issue. Unfortunately I sold my '91 Merc 90hp last year along with the factory service manual otherwise I could have copied and sent you the diagnostic steps to test out your components.  As for basic tools, yes and no depending on the issue. For testing you just need a volt/ohm meter. If you have to replace the stator you will need a puller to remove the fly wheel. That is the only specialized tool you will need."
