896015,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-04 19:21:00,8243,"Luckiest driver to be alive, the bus driver that dodged the pipe better than Ali could dodge a punch. Luckiest biker, tie between the guy that had a tre fall on him doing 60 and did not lose control, and the biker that just missed being killed by a flying mattress. Luckiest animal, the squirrel that missed being squished by the race car. Not so lucky, the bear, the deer, the cow, the other deer, and a few others. Quick call Peetah.  Thanks, I needed that. Bad day here on the north shore of Lake Erie, really bad day. I have to thank everyone here on OFC because there is always something here to pass the time and take things off ones mind. 3rd death of a dear friend in 4 weeks yesterday. I hope things do come in threes, this is insane. This will be the third time asked to be a pall bearer in a month, just too much. I don't know if I can do it. Man......I better stop. If I've been my usual yappy self today that's why. Thanks all my OFC pals for listening. What a party pooper eh?"
