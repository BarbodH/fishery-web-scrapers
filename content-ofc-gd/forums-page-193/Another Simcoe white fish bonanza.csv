894903,Sebastian,2015-01-30 00:07:00,208,"On the ice i quickly bag my fish and put them in the slEd. If anyone asks, i havent caught and im not marking."
894907,ketchenany,2015-01-30 00:21:00,3229," When we had the huts if someone caught a fish the others stayed clear, when people see a crowd they assume fish on and move in close. We had enough in our group to set up a perimeter around the huts With flags indicating holes . . . any fish caught was place in a cooler in the hut or under snow and no blood anywhere.  Some people have no respect for others."
894909,irishfield,2015-01-30 00:31:00,26272,"Doesn't matter where you go Emil... has nothing to do with seeing fish.  4 guys fishing an entire lake mid week on sleds... 3500 miles of shoreline... and this guy pulls up in his truck, pulls his Clam out of the back and sets up 60 feet from Terry. Never even says hello!  Joke was on him this round... it was a spot we'd never fished and we just stopped there to give ita try and have lunch. No fish, or structure, there!  "
894910,Acountdeleted,2015-01-30 00:31:00,2562,"Wow. Just terrible how some people act.  I'll be the first to admit, Simcoe is huge and imposing and thinking about finding fish can be daunting, but why oh why would anyone bite the hand that feeds? I really don't know why people take a good thing and spoil it.  Sorry to hear that some louts that were more interested in personal enjoyment then respect ruined your day."
894912,misfish,2015-01-30 00:44:00,29133,"Nice fish and you got a day with the boys Emil.      I was out  last sunday. Set up away from the village. 1/2 hour later,atv pulls up out of no where, not more then 50 ft away. I think WTH????????? All this open space and you come to set up by me????????  Stops,drills and sets up. It was too cold to break down camp and move,but what a dick. It was even to cold to go out and yell at the dick.  Dont let it get you down. It,s not worth it.  Im exploring a new area this weekend. Have not seen an angler there . Im sure if someone see this lone soul out there,they will think OMG,he,s on fish.  Chive on.  B"
894915,Locnar,2015-01-30 00:52:00,645,How's about a two-four for guidance? haha
894916,kenzy31,2015-01-30 01:32:00,261,"Awesome report Emil!! Great to see your boys slammin fish with you  I knew that good thing could only last so long after all the ""trolling"" they did around us last week. Now I don't even know if I want to go there tomorrow... My fuse and patience is a LOT shorter than yours! And I won't have my kids there to make me think twice lol."
894917,Gallie,2015-01-30 01:37:00,1215,"Nice whities!, i have been laughing pretty hard at some of the stuff ive seen just this year.  Guy doing donuts 50 feet from my shack, sleds and atvs flying by almost crushing my tip ups. You know i never set a tip up more than 20 feet from the hut for fear of its demise haha. That being said, in spite of the stupidity i have been slaying fish non stop in the bay so bring on the huddled masses to watch my greatness ??"
895080,glen,2015-01-30 17:21:00,2641,And that's during the week.
895081,manitoubass2,2015-01-30 17:24:00,11391,Reminds me of this...  
895086,Headhunter,2015-01-30 17:56:00,5703,You must eat a lot of Whitefish Emil! HH
895163,icefisherman,2015-01-31 01:21:00,952,"Not just me John, the whole family loves it and eats it 2-3 times a week. Just finished smoking this last batch....nothing better than smoked whitefish.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
895773,TheTallPolak,2015-02-03 17:49:00,26,"Nice Fish! You always seem to know where the fish are! Any tips you'd be willing to share, I'm new to ice fishing and wondering what kind of structure or depths might be the best for targeting Whitefish and Lake trout!"
895776,Beavertail,2015-02-03 18:01:00,331,"Tallpolak, maybe read the original post again."
