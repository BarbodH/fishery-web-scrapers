894170,misfish,2015-01-25 21:22:00,29133,"Auger still cuts like the day I bought it! If I have to replace the cutting head one day, so be it! It doesn't owe me a penny. At the rate it's going though, I don't anticipate it any time soon unless I hit a rock or some crap in the ice!   I would love to try one with my electric drill. I know they come with a plate already attached, but have read where the mounted bit is weak. The drill rounds it off.  I would be just interested in seeing see how it cuts compared to the fin bor 3."
894175,porkpie,2015-01-25 22:15:00,2521,"Me too, I keep thinking I might rig up an adapter for my drill, but I have a gas auger too, so I never seem to get around to it lol!"
894176,misfish,2015-01-25 22:20:00,29133,"Me too, I keep thinking I might rig up an adapter for my drill, but I have a gas auger too, so I never seem to get around to it lol!   I did 14"" of ice with my 8""  finbor 3 today with my cordless. it drilled with ease.  Yesterday I did 32 holes and still had power left from the first and only battery I used."
894246,Fish Farmer,2015-01-26 12:44:00,2234,"Chances it's not your blades, it's your frame the blades are fasten to. Take the blades off and put the frame part that the blade is screwed to in a vise and give it a bend towards the angle it's factory bent. Put the blades back on and you should be good to go. The frame gets bent over time, that's why after you shim your blades it works for awhile then nada. Mora augers are known for that. You have nothing to lose. New blades are almost half the price of a new auger. It worked on my old Mora, cuts like new and my blades are not super sharp."
895675,SirCranksalot,2015-02-02 22:47:00,3291,"Good news! I had a closer look and I could see there were some burrs toward the OD of the auger, esp on one blade. I Googled 'sharpening auger blades' and came up with this: ah, phukit!"
895712,S.M.05,2015-02-03 03:16:00,145,"I always buy them new, never had any luck sharpening them. Don't buy the ones made in China only the original made in Sweden."

895791,Joeytier,2015-02-03 19:51:00,3990,You could have just spent 15 bux and have an auger that cuts like brand new in about 2 minutes lol
895939,Sinker,2015-02-04 15:10:00,8692,"Yep....this ^  Sharpened auger blades never work the same as new. Get new, and take care of them. They last a long time if you're careful with them.  S."
896608,SirCranksalot,2015-02-07 19:14:00,3291,I guess you guys are trying to be helpful but you sure as hell had  me fooled!!
896641,porkpie,2015-02-07 22:06:00,2521,"I don't think they are being unhelpful, just truthful.  You said yourself that it's better but doesn't cut the same.  I tend to agree with them, I've never found re sharpened auger blades to be near as good as brand new ones."
893671,SirCranksalot,2015-01-23 14:08:00,3291,"I have a 6"" manual auger that doesn't seem to cut too well. I suspect the blades are a bit dull even though it's only a couple of years old. The feel sharp, though. I'm thinking of buying new blades to see if that's the problem. I have heard that some replacement blades are actually better than the original ones. Comments? Any recommendation on brand or where to buy?  Thanks a lot, from Cranksalot!"
893678,Fisherman,2015-01-23 14:59:00,7201,"What brand of auger?  Some blades fit different augers, most don't."
893682,Rod Caster,2015-01-23 15:19:00,5784,"If it's a finbore:  1350 Phillip Murray Avenue, Oshawa, ON L1J 6Z9(905) 571-3001  Order direct, get a couple replacement sets."
893685,manitoubass2,2015-01-23 15:42:00,11391,"Oh man I do not miss the days of using my manual auger lol.  Replacement blades are available almost any outdoors shop, just make sure you get the right ones.  Keep em sharp man, or thats tough work drillin manually.  Not sure where I heard it but after each outing I used to give my blades a quick shot of wd40 and they stayed really good for a few years. I also babied it so maybe that was it???"
893694,SirCranksalot,2015-01-23 17:24:00,3291,"It's a Normark, but the blase are marked MORA ICE (And lemme tell ya', there was mora ice yesterday than I wan't to drill thru  ) I'm not sure if Normark is a manufacturer or a wholesaler e.g they sell Rapala lures but don't make them.   ."
893703,Rod Caster,2015-01-23 18:40:00,5784,"I buy my blades directly from that number I posted, save in store mark-ups. Give them a call and ask if they have your model of blades"
893715,dracokaos,2015-01-23 19:44:00,116,I believe Artisan is the parent company of Rapala and Normark
893740,Joeytier,2015-01-23 21:56:00,3990,"I just received my set of 6"" Finbor blades from the Normark wholesaler today.  Ordered on Tuesday and shipped up the North of North Bay.  Super easy to deal with!"
893750,SirCranksalot,2015-01-23 23:12:00,3291,"Now I've read elsewhere that sometimes the blade angle is wrong i.e. too small and that it can be shimmed to make it cut better. I might give that a try, given that the blades feel quite sharp. Has anybody tried this and head success with it?"
893759,Joeytier,2015-01-23 23:43:00,3990,"Is the auger fin-bore (curved blades) or swede-bore (straight)?  If they're curved you shouldn't need shims, just buy new blades, they're only 20 bucks."
893833,Mister G,2015-01-24 13:54:00,1429,"You can also convert that hand powered auger into a electric portable drill auger for about $25.....did mine that is a 7"" and it cut right through ice without a problem."
893839,SirCranksalot,2015-01-24 14:14:00,3291,"JT---mine is straight, so must be Swede. I don't mind paying the $20 as long as that would fix the problem, but maybe the blade angle is the problem.  Thx, guys, for your suggestions. I'll try Normark in Oshawa if I buy new ones."
893841,Rod Caster,2015-01-24 14:24:00,5784,"99% of the time, dull or 'off' blades are the problem. It takes very little to ruin that edge.  The Swedebore blades are much easier to find in stores I've noticed."
893855,Joeytier,2015-01-24 15:23:00,3990,"If you really want your manual augering to be far less work, buy a Fin-Bore auger.  The blade design is far superior and the handles are offset.  I bought a swede-bore a few years ago in a pinch when it was my only option and I couldnt believe how much worse it was.  I havent used it since."
893868,KLINKER,2015-01-24 15:57:00,256,"Buddy had a machine shop and they'd bring them in for sharpening, every time it was the angle of the blades had been bent."
894091,SirCranksalot,2015-01-25 14:40:00,3291,"I was at CTC yesterday looking for something else but I check to see if they had blades. They did, but I was talking to another customer who said he sharpens his with a belt sander with a 160 grit belt. He'd tried various other methods w/o too much luck."
894092,Rod Caster,2015-01-25 14:41:00,5784,"I brought mine to a professional sharpener.... they worked ok, but not nearly as nice as the factory angle."
894118,manitoubass2,2015-01-25 16:36:00,11391,"Resharpened are never as good as new.  Thats what Ive seen on this board a thousand times.  I wouldnt know because I just replace mine.  In fact im buying some new blades today. I let a buddy borrow my eskimo shark and he like to drill half holes to store the auger, or redrill old holes.  He wont be using my auger again"

I just used mine one season maybe about 8 outings, so I'm surprised that they already have a problem(but as I said, they feel sharp).  Yeah, your buddy abusing your machine----doesn't auger well for the future of your friendship.  (Sorry, just can't resist)"
894126,manitoubass2,2015-01-25 17:09:00,11391,This will be the first time on this machine. Its also my first gas auger.  When I used a manual auger I changed blades probably every 3-4years.  With my gas auger I believe I could go longer. I take good care of them

894136,porkpie,2015-01-25 18:17:00,2521,"I've got 8 seasons and a ton of holes on my Nils Master.  I haven't had to replace the cutting head once.  Don't bang the blades, don't open old holes, don't lend your auger, and give it a light coating of oil after every trip, if you do this with every auger no matter the brand, you will experience very prolonged blade life!  I agree you are wasting your time trying to sharpen mora style blades. They are generally junk once they need a sharpen!  Buy new, save the headache.  Nothing worse than an auger that cuts poorly."
894139,misfish,2015-01-25 18:33:00,29133, Dont leave your auger in a half drilled hole to use it as a stand. The hole freezing back up will bend the blades. I cant believe how many I see like that out there.
894144,misfish,2015-01-25 19:23:00,29133,"  Replacing those is not cheap. It a whole head,not just blades.  http://www.fishusa.com/product/Nils-USA-Auger-Replacement-Cutting-Heads?utm_source=google_ps&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=google_ps&gclid=CMydiv_ur8MCFQeRaQod5RcA0w"
