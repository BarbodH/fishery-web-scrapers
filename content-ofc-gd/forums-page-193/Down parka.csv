Would it lose its ""loft"" after awhile? It's reassuring to have it out on the ice, but I don't always need it. I was also thinking of using a dry bag. Any tips? Thanks."
896127,chris.brock,2015-02-05 02:42:00,4053,"I don't have any facts or references to back this up, but I wouldn't compress it. I don't have a jacket but I keep my sleeping bags hung up and out of the compression bag as much as possible."
896129,woodenboater,2015-02-05 02:54:00,2277,"I wouldn't worry about compressing it for the day but like Chris says, don't store it packed tight. Down needs room to breathe during storage afaik. My down sleeping bags are stored in oversized cotton stuff sacks. Parkas on hangers. Having said this, I do have a MEC down parka that I keep in my car for emergencies, in a stuff sack. Never had a problem fluffing it back to life a minute or two after pulling it out."

896147,wormdunker,2015-02-05 10:06:00,1711,"Interesting topic as I also have a down bag & an older parka.  My sleeping bag is rolled tightly in a duffel bag & never had a problem keeping me warm when I pull it out.  Recently I have been looking at the Arc'Teryx jackets.  They are awesome!  Lightweight (14 oz). durable & warm.  Many features such as storm cuffs, storm hood which is best hood I've ever seen.  Rather expensive at $750.00.  That's probably why I still don't own one."
896153,Yellow Fever,2015-02-05 12:03:00,139,"Down is supposed to be ""stuffed"" that way it does not get any empty insulation parts in folds or creases...of course as mentioned make sure it is dry before you put it away."
896365,singingdog,2015-02-06 11:21:00,1047,"Stuffed for the day, or several days, will not affect it's long-term insulation. I have a 30 yr old down sleeping bag that has been on many multi-week trips (stuffed every day, all day), and is till as warm as I remember it being new (insert disclaimer for old brain). As Chris said, store sy it uncompressed when you get home. I cannot say the same for any synthetic insulation I have owned....all have lost significant loft over the course of just a few years."
896417,Mister G,2015-02-06 17:14:00,1429,"We have a HUGE comforter that is all down filled....it sits on the bed and is about 4-5"" high without exaggeration. We put it in one of those bags you attach a vacuum cleaner to suck out ALL the air for summer storage and it hasn't effected it in over 15 years."
