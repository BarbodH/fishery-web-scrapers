896128,Joeytier,2015-02-05 02:51:00,3990,"Lots of good operators, not many bad ones.  Time to check some websites.  Tama Kwa and Rob Hyatt's bungalows are typically good fish producers, but Idle Tyme and Waltonian Inn are also in good spots, but are typically are a little more hit and miss.  Avoid Snofari at all costs unless you like mudpuppies and being right next to one of the busiest access points on the lake."
896133,Dutch01,2015-02-05 03:42:00,1431,"Last I heard Tama Kwa is not doing huts this year.  Don't take my word for it though, that's just what I heard.  Went there in September and had a great time.  Spent a weekend in one of Dennis Johnston's Ice Bungalows in January and had a great time as well.  I would fish with them again, they're a good outfitter."
896135,tender52,2015-02-05 04:02:00,270,The boys and I have been traveling there for years. Rob is your best bet. we like to bounce around and check out other guys. Rob is where we finally said no more other guys. Bear creek has day huts. They will come get you at night. I think your Missus might like a comfy bed. Plus after sun down nothing hits
896139,2 tone z71,2015-02-05 04:48:00,1311,Thanks fellas I fired off a email to Rob ..ya showed momma the bunk with a sliver of foam ..conversation got quite lol
896143,Nipfisher,2015-02-05 05:55:00,2449,"Reeds Outdoor Adventure will get you the most fish. They were formally Grump and Grumpy's and have the best spot on the lake for numbers of perch, walleye, and ling.  Another great spot is Barry Kraemer from Seguin Beech Campgrounds. He has 4-5 bungalows that are decent. You will not beat the service Barry provides.   Our member NAW should chime in by the weekend with his report from Palace Nipfisher. He is staying in my hut for 2 nights and although it is not a bungalow.....it fits the bill."
896148,wormdunker,2015-02-05 10:10:00,1711,Nipfisher has an awesome hut!  Make him an offer he can't refuse!  LOL!
896252,NAW,2015-02-05 23:32:00,4022,^^^^^^^.  Just got back from 2 nights at Blairs hut!!  But the missus might kill you!!  Unless she's hardy...
896314,2 tone z71,2015-02-06 02:34:00,1311,Lol read your report..she's raring to go ..I'm excited..we got a bungalow thru Rob ..really looking forward to it
896326,Nipfisher,2015-02-06 02:56:00,2449,You won't regret booking with Rob Hyatt. He is a good guy and treats his customers well.
896328,irishfield,2015-02-06 02:58:00,26272,Just don't steal his 4 wheeler to go to the mozzy!
896333,2 tone z71,2015-02-06 03:01:00,1311,They closed the mozzy last yr no ?
896337,irishfield,2015-02-06 03:07:00,26272,Don't know.. I only see it from the highway on every pass North.
896338,Nipfisher,2015-02-06 03:07:00,2449,Yep. Closed.
896351,Joeytier,2015-02-06 04:37:00,3990,"It was bought and will be re-opened, apparently as a ritzy joint!  Not sure how it could get any classier though"
896355,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-06 04:51:00,8243,"PM Nipfisher, his hut looks great. Where is/was mozzy? I thought we hit every place around Nip in the last 36 years. Is the Ballet still open in Nord Bay? Maybe that's mozzy."
896358,2 tone z71,2015-02-06 04:53:00,1311,Ritzy joint lol..you mean the piss smell ..mold on the ceiling tiles and $ 5.00 plastic lawn chairs are getting upgraded ..not to mention the classy 4x8 untreated piece of plywood they had for a stage/pole awww miss the ole mozzy
896359,2 tone z71,2015-02-06 04:54:00,1311,Fannys is still open
896447,Rod Caster,2015-02-06 19:33:00,5784,From what I understand Blair's shack comes equipped with full entertainment and free drinks
