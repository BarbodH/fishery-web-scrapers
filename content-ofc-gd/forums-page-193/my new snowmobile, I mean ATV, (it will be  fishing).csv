896332,2 tone z71,2015-02-06 03:00:00,1311,What kinda chuck wagon contraption lol..awesome engineering Terry..love the garage builds ..looks like fun
896336,workwear,2015-02-06 03:07:00,592,you know your a redneck when..........lol...j/k.....looks great...best of luck!!
896347,Joey,2015-02-06 04:13:00,9122,"Wow, very Cool Terry.   Paul is on call this weekend, but you can bet we'll be out there next Sunday.  PM me if you want to go"
896354,Joeytier,2015-02-06 04:49:00,3990,Don't you have a sled?  Lol
896357,irishfield,2015-02-06 04:52:00,26272,LOL Joeytier... it would have been easier for him to put wheels on his sled skis.. YES!
896360,wormdunker,2015-02-06 08:30:00,1711,"That is awesome!  I really like the width of the tracks - more grip & better traction.  Very good ideas here.  Fabricating skis that go around the wheels is an awesome idea - in case you accidentally engage 4 wheel drive.  Last year I investigated the tracks for ATVs (the type that wrap around the original 4 wheels) - they were about $4,000.00, then you also need a big engine to drive them.  I was advised a 500cc might be a little small."
896361,Joeytier,2015-02-06 08:52:00,3990,"I saw tracks on an Outlander 500 earlier this year, and it performed quite well in deep snow, but 4 grand buys you a very nice snow machine!"
896368,wormdunker,2015-02-06 12:03:00,1711,Right on Joey!  That's why I don't own a set of trax.  Terry's set up is something I'm going to give a lot of serious thought to.
896375,Sinker,2015-02-06 12:46:00,8692,"What was the bottom line on this project, Terry? It will be awesome on the lakes, but maybe not in tight trails.  S."
896378,Terry,2015-02-06 13:21:00,14456,It is as wide as some Polaris atvs  Bottom line. Price?  I have. 2200.00. Into it  A big expense is you have to buy smaller tires so when you add the track they are the same hight as the front. Then you need the 2 followi tires for the ever back.
896394,Gerritt,2015-02-06 14:55:00,6129,Easily removable in case of breakdown? Blowing a track etc?
896395,BillM,2015-02-06 14:56:00,17367,"Terry, that's pretty awesome!"
896397,Terry,2015-02-06 15:08:00,14456,You could still run it if one of the tracks blew Really the only thing that could slow you down would be a wrecked track or tire.   And you would be able to travel slow with this. Unlike a regular Atv or skidoo.  You blow a track or tire on them and you are done  I have 40 mins of running it so I can't answer all the questions
896398,Fisherman,2015-02-06 15:10:00,7201,"Every time you drive up highway 11, they still have that one on the post way up in the air.  Too bad they went out of business."
896408,Terry,2015-02-06 16:34:00,14456,Yup  It is too bad
896419,glen,2015-02-06 17:15:00,2641,Just sitting there it is cool.
896574,mr blizzard,2015-02-07 16:33:00,1589,"Awesome , some thought and time went into that for sure, have fun with it."
896592,fishnsled,2015-02-07 17:58:00,3520,One wicked looking ride!    to you and Brian!
896812,Moosebunk,2015-02-08 20:04:00,3970,Ohhh you gotta be fnkiddinme!  That's gnarly dood!  Job well engineered and done Terry.
896263,Terry,2015-02-06 00:14:00,14456,it's been a long time getting everything I need  to build it got the last part today and put it together after work and took her out for a spin         
896267,Ice Fishing Ham,2015-02-06 00:25:00,83,Nice work Terry. Looks like it will go through anything. Is this a kit or did you make it from scratch?
896268,chris.brock,2015-02-06 00:26:00,4053,Very cool!  Is that a kit or a home made invention? Put a video up if you get a chance.  edit- IFH beat me to it
896269,Terry,2015-02-06 00:27:00,14456,"I got most of the  parts from  hitch a track , they are out of business but had some parts  Brian made a bunch of parts for me"
896272,lew,2015-02-06 00:31:00,12766,"Very impressive Terry, looks like that thing will go just about anywhere."
896274,John Bacon,2015-02-06 00:41:00,3277,Nice work.  I assume that you started with a two wheel drive machine?  If it was four wheel drive those skis on the front may not work quire as well as you hope.
896276,manitoubass2,2015-02-06 00:45:00,11391,Where is the ductape red green??  Looks awesome
896278,Terry,2015-02-06 00:49:00,14456,"I can switch from 2 to 4 wheel drive, so the skis will work just fine Wayne came up with a way to have the skis built around the wheels , so it will be able to be in 4 wheel drive, ..a summer project"
896279,irishfield,2015-02-06 00:49:00,26272,MUD FLAPS!! It needs mud flaps!.. well snow flaps..
896280,Terry,2015-02-06 00:50:00,14456,oh yeah it does
896281,Sinker,2015-02-06 00:54:00,8692,That is SLICK!!
896291,ecmilley,2015-02-06 01:26:00,2163,Looks intresting lets go back laking
896298,Gerritt,2015-02-06 01:50:00,6129,Sweet rig! Look forward to some video!
896300,irishfield,2015-02-06 01:52:00,26272,We'll get some for you G when he's stuck between two trees!!!
896301,porkpie,2015-02-06 01:54:00,2521,Pretty cool setup!
896304,Terry,2015-02-06 02:00:00,14456,"I will be making it 4"" narrower , but not in time for the trip"
896305,irishfield,2015-02-06 02:02:00,26272,4 inches shouldn't make any difference on our normal portages.. not sure you'd get up to Brown's with that though.
896307,muskymatt,2015-02-06 02:09:00,2608,kewl
896308,Gerritt,2015-02-06 02:15:00,6129,LMAO!
896313,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-06 02:31:00,8243,"The ingenuity of the folks on this site is phenomenal. What a nice set up. Dragons Den boys? I'll do the Bull ing, you do the builds."
896319,Terry,2015-02-06 02:46:00,14456,"it's 8 "" wider then most skidoos what yea think am I going to get stuck between 2 trees"
896323,irishfield,2015-02-06 02:53:00,26272,I don't know...you know the tightness of some trails. I'm just thinking before skis were the wide part and the narrow end followed. You're the other way around...
896324,Terry,2015-02-06 02:55:00,14456,you want me to go in reverse lol
896327,irishfield,2015-02-06 02:56:00,26272,We could video that too !!
896330,NAW,2015-02-06 02:59:00,4022,That's wicked!!
