In the first half with 6 seconds to go  afield goal try was the obvious thing to do. He gambled and they score a touchdown. Suddenly he's a genius.   6 seconds is enough time to attempt a short pass into the endzone. If incomplete would have 1-2 seconds left on the clock to kick a FG."

895553,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-02 06:02:00,8243,"All the talking heads are calling Uncle Petes call the worst call in the 49 years of Super Bowl play. If that was a seasoned QB back there, Rogers, Manning, I can make a long list he would have changed the call to 41 fire. Simple 4 back pounds it through 1 hole. Done, game over, size your ring, go to Disney land. NFL network reports Seattle players screaming at the top of their lungs coming off the field various disparages with Carols name attached. Too bad, no way to lose with the highest scoring RB in the league blocking on a pass play from inside the 5. Stupid is all I can say. Absolutely insane. Coach choked."
895558,muddler,2015-02-02 12:21:00,623,"Should have, could have , would have, etc. Carroll has always been a gambler.  In the first half with 6 seconds to go  afield goal try was the obvious thing to do. He gambled and they score a touchdown. Suddenly he's a genius.  Now all the nay sayers call it a dumb play at the end. If the pass is 6 inches to the right, it would have been caught. If the defense was not just perfect that pass is a TD. New England and and the rest of the world expected a running play. We all expect the running play to score, I wonder what the New England defense was thinking? The interception was a split second decision and it worked.  Pete Carroll got them there by gambling, just look at the previous game against Green Bay.  These are pros. They know what they are doing. Shuolda, woulda and coulda are great after the play. It came this close to working. Good call. The gambler lost .......this time.   I didn't like either team and I watched because it is the Super Bowl. Great game."
895560,Handlebarz,2015-02-02 12:37:00,3790,My thoughts for NE was just let them score fast so you have extra time on the clock. I was with the rest of the world Lynch will run it in but was shocked to see it flying through the air. My wife and I were both yelling NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO then the interception Woohoo what a great game. I am not a huge fan of either team but have always like watching the Pats. Back in the 90's I was Green Bay all the way but now I watch for players I like not any 1 team. Lynch is awesome to watch same as Wilson. I would have loved to see Indy there.  Best Super Bowl I have seen in many years. Usually I head to bed at 9 to get sleep for work last night I stayed up for the end glad I did.
895571,FloatnFly,2015-02-02 13:41:00,1640,"i can understand the thinking behind it, pick on a rookie dman, who doesn;t have a single career INT, you still have 3rd and 4th downs, you still had 30 seconds on the clock with NE having 3 timeouts, and brady has picking apart your defense all day.  so pass the ball and run some time off the clock and give the ball to NE with as little time left as possible"
895573,BillM,2015-02-02 13:57:00,17367,Passing the ball when you're on the 1 yard line when it's 2nd and goal with probably the best running back in the league?  Who thought up that master plan? LOL!!!!
895576,Mister G,2015-02-02 14:15:00,1429,"Big games are won and lost on great plays and the NE defensive back made a GREAT play....his only interception in his rookie year.  Somehow I was hoping both teams could lose because I can't stand either one.........and in a small way they did.......Seattle LOST the game and NE just got lucky Seattle didn't run the ball because NE knew the game was in the bag for Seattle until a stupid pass play was called.  So as I said.............NE didn't win the game.......Seattle LOST the game, similar to the Bills losing Super Bowl 25 to the Giants."

895580,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-02 14:32:00,8243,"Now that the smoke has cleared the  thinking behind he call was that Lynch had 5 previous attempts from inside the 1 during the season, he was stopped 4 times. Not one QB had thrown a pick from the 1 yard line during the entire season including playoffs. So the odds were in coaches favor.  Muddler, if everyone thought the way that you do there would be no reason to pay all the talking heads out there. And by the way while I have this keyboard this Monday AM, this armchair QB must admit you are right as far as second guessing, that's were the fun is."

Food wise, it has nothing to do with the game but I just grabbed a mammoth prime rib roast from Costco for Sunday.

894733,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 21:41:00,8243,"Sorry guys quote feature still not working even with new today laptop.  Mike Borger, I am a fan of the game not the NFL. The league wants me to hurl chunks. Just rule making beurocrats (sic) that think they need to save the world and the game. They constantly think it's broken when it's not. The best recipe for Prime Rib I have ever had is from irecipes.com called Restaurant cut. Dry rub with flour and herbs, just great.  Mr. G, I watched the video and that sure looks like a winner. Now if it was an entire deboned piglet that is splayed and rubbed with a pesto of fresh herbs like fennel, basil, rosemary, parsley , dry oregano, fresh garlic and a few I don't remember that is made into a pesto and rubbed all inside then rolled and tied with a bouquet of sprigs of those herbs as a bed and baked for hours in the same manner is an ancient Roman dish that is called Porcetta. It can be served warm or cold.  If anyone has been to one of those huge Italian stags most likely Porcetta was served as an appetizer and at mid night usually. I know that there are bakeries in Hamilton that will do one or more for you in their ovens. You can bring them the dressed piglet or they will do the entire job. Same idea as Chef Mikes shoulder. His I like because I can do it myself in the kitchen or on the BBQ without doing an entire piglet. I personally like it hot, not cold. I don't like cold lard like fat but love hot crispy skin and oily fat. Too bad I shouldn't eat it. I guess a slice won't kill me."

Next comes 2 lb lean ground, garlic, celery, onions, beans, mushrooms and a generous helping of ginger.  Sauce base starts with 1 can of manwich, tomato paste, Guinness BBQ Sauce, thai seasoning and add a bit of hot sauce so it just has a slight bite!  Slow cooked in the crock pot for 3 hours. Unfortunately it's also what I have brought for lunch the last 2 days so unlikely there will be any left for Sunday. Plan to go ice fishing anyways!"

894627,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 02:33:00,8243,"As far as the overly hyped day where multi millions ( heard it's close to or more than a billion) of dollars change hands I'll remember what my dear Uncle Chuck whom was born in Lexington Kentucky and raised in North Tonawanda in western NY said one Grey Cup Sunday. As we sat waiting for the kick off that Sunday that was sometime before 1959 he simply said, "" I wish we had something like this ( Grey Cup week) for our leagues in the states"". That was in the days the CFL eastern and western conference championships were a 2 game total point playoff series. I'm either getting old or remember everything I have ever heard from birth.  As Rodbender said the team I have a square on or my measly dime bet on is the team I want to win the Lombardi. Or if the Bills are in I pay money to have my heart broken, again and, and, and again."

894651,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 05:50:00,8243,"You folks are making me hungry. I had to read the Pot Brownie suggestion a few time before I got it. Super Bowl Sunday is the day domestic violence calls to the Police are the highest of the year. If everyone ate or smoked pot instead of drinking shots and chasing them with beer or some other imported powder or pills domestic violence would drop instead of rise. I don't smoke stupid stick but can tell you when I worked the doors at the bars way back when Moses was a teenager and we had the bar after I left the plant I never, ever, not once had a problem with someone high on weed, even at the steel company come to think about it.  One puffer fell asleep one night and the staff never checked the stalls before closing, a big, big no no. Forget the safe you can have 10 grand in food and booze there for the taking. The motion detector triggered an alarm at 5AM and I got a call from the security company as well as the building super, I told the security company to silence the alarm and call the Police as I was an hour away. The cops could clearly see someone quietly sitting at the bar. When I got there 45 minutes latter (one Cop mentioned that, sharp young lady) there was what I thought was the entire downtown division of the city Police dept. outside. I called the bar but the intruder didn't answer. I went up to the window to see if I could see who it was and this with a strong protest of the staff Sgt. It was a young puffer who I called Johnny Chicodia, I'm not sure of the spelling but chicodia means dandelion in Italian, or in other words ""weed"". I opened the door and asked what the f*#k sakes was he doing. He fell asleep before closing time and then when he woke up everyone was gone. He went to let himself out the alarm went on and he was trapped and frightened, really felt for the poor kid. He didn't answer the phone because he remembers me saying absolutely no one was allowed to go behind the bar besides staff. So I sent the cops away and got the $100.00 fine for a false alarm. I could have had him charged with trespassing and save the 100 bucks, no way, this kid wouldn't harm a fly and if anyone was going to get a goof tax it was the bouncer who didn't check the facility before lock up.  Anyway I made Johnny and myself a big breakfast and he left. But not before he asked of it was OK to fire up a blunt, I said are you nuts? He replied "" There's no one here Dude"" I'm here Johnny Chicodia, I'm here!!  Now that's a thread hi jacking for sure."
894653,manitoubass2,2015-01-28 06:01:00,11391,Epic story....  what football game?
894655,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 08:22:00,8243,"Mani2bass, I think that was the Carolina New England game, yes had to be 2001. We served Carolinian BBQ pulled Pork and Crab Rolls. No way I was feeding those Hamilton hooligans Lobster, they would have eaten us into the poor house. But it was real crab, I don't know what ocean it came out of though. Actually had someone drive down to Niagara Falls NY and got the real deal Crab Roll buns. That was a great game regardless of the half time Tom Foolery. Wardrobe malfunction, yea that was a new one.  No one caught my mistake that Denver played the Pats for the Super Bowl. Can't happen can it?"
894677,blaque,2015-01-28 13:05:00,2419,"Great story.............Im not a ""puffer"" either but can tell you without a doubt, Id rather hang out with a pot smoker than a drinker any day of the week lol"
894684,Mister G,2015-01-28 15:15:00,1429,"Hate both teams.......but I guess with Lynch, I hate the Sea Hawks even more.....so I guess go NE.  The NFL should make NE play with a over inflated ball for this game.  BTW we are having what I would at any game...........HOT DOGS done on my open fire from my wood burning stove. Also French Onion soup that a member here shared his recipe with me....I think in a previous life he was a CHEF ! ! !............can anyone here guess who he is  ?    ?   ?"
894685,manitoubass2,2015-01-28 15:19:00,11391,Bigugli? Hes the man for chefing it up
