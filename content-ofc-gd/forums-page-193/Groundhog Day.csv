895559,Fishwilly,2015-02-02 12:34:00,206,Ok gang what's your prediction? (for what it's worth lol)
895561,Gallie,2015-02-02 12:39:00,1215,6 more weeks of winter
895562,Fishwilly,2015-02-02 12:42:00,206,That's what I always thought
895567,Acountdeleted,2015-02-02 13:20:00,2562,The groundhog can't get out of the hole. The snow has it packed in.
895568,Terry,2015-02-02 13:29:00,14456,I use a calendar to predict spring. This year it says March 21
895569,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-02 13:35:00,956,Back in the day they used to use bears instead of groundhogs lol.
895570,bigugli,2015-02-02 13:37:00,6138,I hope earlier than last spring.  We still had patches of frozen ground April 15th
895574,SirCranksalot,2015-02-02 14:02:00,3291,The groundhog is never wrong! Six more weeks of winter and an 'early spring' or one and the same thing!!
895618,Big Cliff,2015-02-02 17:00:00,6899,"That little sucker is only right 37% of the time so that means he is about as accurate as the weatherman (well a little better than the weatherman, oh to get beaten out by a dumb rodent, the shame of it)!  Best thing you can do with a nice fat groundhog is make a nice stew, sit inside where it is warm and watch spring come when it gets here."
895619,Joeytier,2015-02-02 17:03:00,3990,Only 6 more weeks of winter would mean an early spring here.  Bring it on!
895621,SirCranksalot,2015-02-02 17:13:00,3291,Only 6 more weeks up there would mean global warning has hit full stride!!!
895622,Rich Clemens,2015-02-02 17:16:00,3131,Yeah.  Cloudy and raining down here this am ....   so how dioes he see his shadow ? Maybe if we turn off all the camera lights - we may get a true prediction.
895628,davew3,2015-02-02 17:37:00,430,"In six weeks I will be sitting on a beach in St. Martin with a cold beer and my fishing pole, so I don't care what Willie said"
895683,Fishwilly,2015-02-02 23:06:00,206,I hear ya brother. I'll be parking my ass on a beach in Mexico at the end of the month.....Oh yeah and do a bit fishing!!
895691,SirCranksalot,2015-02-02 23:24:00,3291,Wimps!!!
895735,Big Cliff,2015-02-03 12:37:00,6899,

I shot the little bugger last year.....didn't you notice this  year they used a ordinary woodchuck....LOL"
895746,Mister G,2015-02-03 14:57:00,1429,"BTW just in case you didn't know.........6 more weeks of winter would mean spring on March 16th..........sounds good to me, however we all know better."
895747,outllaw,2015-02-03 15:04:00,1232,the hogs in the slo-cooker here. were snowed in.
