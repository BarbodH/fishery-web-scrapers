895794,lew,2015-02-03 20:18:00,12766,Great video !!  Catching muskies on an 8 is without doubt the most exciting way to get them.  Nothing better than seeing a big girl twisting & turning trying to grab your bait and then just hammering it and the fight is on.  If your not doing an 8 or at least a circle after EVERY cast you missing alot of fish.

896126,Gregoire,2015-02-05 02:31:00,1397,The best way to learn how to do an good 8 is to LOTW. On waters where they seem to only eat on the 8' you learn really quickly how to do it right.  Musky on the fly is something I really want to start doing. Those ones look like they came from St Clair.
896134,landry,2015-02-05 03:50:00,1005,1/3 of my St Clair muskies came on figure eights last summer. It is a great feeling. And there is a knack to it. That guy's figure eights looked a little sketchy but it worked.
896136,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-05 04:28:00,8243,"Insane stuff. I can't imagine a good size Musky on a fly rod. I finally had the pleasure of feeling the power of a few smaller Musky on heavy equipment last fall with Dan Columby, all I can describe it as is pure power, unadulterated power. The closest had to be a 33lb King in Lake Ontario."

You certainly don't need to travel to LOTW to learn how to get fish on a figure 8. All muskies will hit an 8 and ANY lake that has muskies is a good spot for a newbie to learn how to do it.
896159,manitoubass2,2015-02-05 13:12:00,11391,"Nah, come fish LOTW's???"
896160,lew,2015-02-05 13:16:00,12766,It'd be a nice trip for sure.

All muskies will hit an 8 and ANY lake that has muskies is a good spot for a newbie to learn how to do it.  I was a bit sloppy with my post. I meant to say fish waters where you see a lot of fish follow and eat on the 8. You really learn to refine your technique.  Check out this link to see Cowanjo catch a nice fish on the 8:
