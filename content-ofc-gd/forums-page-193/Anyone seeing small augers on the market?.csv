896473,misfish,2015-02-06 22:38:00,29133,I remember seeing perch fells with 2.5-3.5 inch ice augers for perching.  Has anyone seen these for sale any where? Would be nice to have for locating depths quick with the electric. Instead of augering 8 inch holes all the time.  Thanks  B
896479,gaspumper,2015-02-06 23:22:00,393,You should be able to set your transducer in a tub of water or right on the ice to see how deep it is.

896483,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-06 23:33:00,10439,"Smallest I have seen lately are the 4 1/2"" Nils. Cabelas actually has the high velocity model on sale for $104 right now.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Nils-USA-High-Velocity-Hand-Auger/1089564.uts  If you have good clear ice it is easier to put the transducer (as long as it's a flat ice ducer) on the ice (shovel away snow) and with the sonar on pour a little water on the ducer to couple it to the ice and you can read depth easily. I have read depth through more than 5' of ice and I have even marked fish through the ice."
896484,misfish,2015-02-06 23:37:00,29133,"Im sure the ones I seen were old  Nls. They were that green color. I know my BIL had one many years ago. Maybe he still has it. I,ll have to give him a call.  That thing just zipped through the ice."

896517,Christopheraaron,2015-02-07 02:43:00,3525,"4"" augers are easy to come by, never seen smaller though."
896525,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-07 03:26:00,2582,Check out Sail Brian. I got my Finn Bore 3 in the Oshawa Sail a few years back. Never use anything else when I go after perch. I have a 5 inch Lazer I use for crappies and walleye. Can't believe how much easier a 4 is then a 5.
896526,ch312,2015-02-07 03:36:00,1590,You should be able to set your transducer in a tub of water or right on the ice to see how deep it is.  A bit of minnow water splashed on bare ice is good enough for the x67 and if you're not into minnows you can simply spit on the ground and swirl the transducer a bit. Any clear liquid will work and you only need the smallest amount of form a bit of suction between the ice and transducer.

(keeps it from freezing). Easy to refill after you drill a hole or two.

896530,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-07 03:45:00,10439,If there is any white ice or air pockets it doesn't but on clear ice it works perfectly. I think the thickest I have shot through so far is about 5 1/2 feet.

896558,Fisherpete,2015-02-07 14:07:00,1814,"All hand augers are on sale at SAIL in Oshawa right now... 20% off... They have the best prices on Fin-bores anyways, regular $99.99 for an 8"" - so you can grab one right now for $80! I think they also had 4"" and 6"" Fin-Bores for even cheaper."
896564,BFSC Kevin,2015-02-07 15:10:00,1351,"Yes.  I saw a 4"" Finbore III at the sail in Vaughan last week."
896572,Sinker,2015-02-07 16:30:00,8692,"I usually drill a couple turns of the auger, put a little water in, and shoot the ducer right thru the ice. Never had a problem. It won't mark fish or anything, and might not tell you the depth properly on the readout, but it will mark bottom, and you can figure it out from there. Works great. I never drill holes to find the depth.  S."
896593,Sharkbait22,2015-02-07 18:07:00,297,Same thing works in a canoe. I use my X67c icepack in the summer on back lakes. Put the iceducer down and a few drops of water. Way better than a awkward bracket over the side!
896612,SirCranksalot,2015-02-07 19:18:00,3291,If there is any white ice or air pockets it doesn't but on clear ice it works perfectly.   Slushy ice is pretty well all we get here in sub-tropical S. Ont!!!

Going to stick it out til seasons end and see if there are any real deals.  Shane,I,ll give your way a try. Lots of snow coverage here now. Walking and dragging and popping shallow hole is in order for the morning trip out.."

896766,misfish,2015-02-08 16:58:00,29133,Thanks Pete.  More worried about getting around out there now. Holy snow fall. DAMIT.
896786,ch312,2015-02-08 18:53:00,1590," Slushy ice is pretty well all we get here in sub-tropical S. Ont!!!  Not this year on the waters I have fished. Simcoe, LPB and a couple smaller lakes all had clear ice before we got the dumping of snow. Makes for a great reaction from first timers when you're gunning it towards what appears to be a massive area of open water and they think you're on a suicide mission."
