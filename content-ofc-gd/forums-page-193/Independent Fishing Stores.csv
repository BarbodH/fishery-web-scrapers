896003,kuhaman,2015-02-04 18:48:00,503,I buy almost all my gear from Peters tackle in St Catharines or Lake Huron Rod and Gun in Underwood. Both are great stores and have great staff
896010,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-04 19:00:00,8243,"Mr. G,  You can't go wrong with service like that. I don't think there is a Cabela's within 2 hours of us. I'm not sure what big box was opened recently in Niagara? That would be under 2 hours. I sure would deal with a store like that if I had to but will still go out of my way to go to a local Mom an Pop. That is if they don't treat me like crap, as did the lady at a tackle shop on the Grand River just south of Hamilton off Argyll St., I won't mention the town, starts with a C and ends with an A. I will quit fishing before I ever give them my money again. I bought a down rigger rod and reel combo and while spooling it the very next day realized the reel was FUBAR. She told be less than 24 hours after I bought it from her that I had to deal with Okuma. Okuma was amazed she didn't take it back right there and then. And that was shortly after dropping $300.00 on a inflatable PFD and a load of tackle. I know of at least 12 pals that will not go there because of this incident. It has cost them many $$$ just from my crew in sales because she didn't hand me the other combo sitting in the rack that was identical. I ran into her husband shortly after that in town and told him, I think if he wasn't married to her he would have canned her. He said I should have seen him first, too bad this ain't baseball, 1 strike your out. Maybe if he offered me something for my troubles but didn't. News travels fast in small towns, all I had to do was tell the town Barber or Mailman. Come on man, or lady. Never again ever."
896013,Mister G,2015-02-04 19:10:00,1429,Sorry to hear about your bad experience with the local guy and that can happen anywhere.......at least you got your rod/reel combo replaced and that's the most important thing there.  BTW what is FUBAR ? ? ?
896016,Gerritt,2015-02-04 19:30:00,6129,I always had good luck and good conversation with the boys from bills bait and tackle once they took it over.. Sadly I moved 3 hours away and small tackle shops like thiers are just not in my area.
896024,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-04 19:55:00,8243,"Yes Mr. G, Okuma came through for me. But it wasn't nessecary and Okuma was very apologetic, they had me go to Sail in Burlington that exchanged it with the OK from the Okuma rep. Actually the rod was of a better quality to boot. That was good of Sail as well, they had zero obligation to do so, a favour to the local Okuma rep they said. I go to Sail now when out that way, just a huge selection where I don't have to wait for Bills to order an item for me. A place like Bill's just can't be expected to have everything stocked like the big box guy.  FUBAR is a saying coined by  US and Canadian servicemen during WW2 to easily describe a very bad situation. screwed up beyond all recognition.  edit: Auto correct uses screwed instead of another 4 letter word that I did not type, just the letter F followed by 'd. There computer try and auto correct that, I dare you."
896052,misfish,2015-02-04 21:27:00,29133," I like to support our local guy. I have even told him straight up,I,ll spend an extra buck or two on items then give to CTC or wally worls or Cabels.. No issues there for me. But the big ticket items he has now,I wont. I wont get into details,but when I can save 40-60 bucks else where,well thats not a few dollars is it. I have even told him that. Not sure of his thinking,but it,s his store right."
896069,bigugli,2015-02-04 22:40:00,6138,  His wholesale cost will be nowheres near as low as a Basspro or Cabelas. Their cost is based on a purchase volume of thousands of units per order.  Pretty hard for a small store to order in 5-600 marcums or 1000 Okuma rods or  1000 Shimano reels. Funny thing is that the big box buying discount is often rarely carried over to the consumer except for a sale event.
896074,misfish,2015-02-04 22:48:00,29133,Very true Bruce.
896125,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-05 02:28:00,8243,"Very true Bruce. Tough for them to compete. A few bucks I can take the hit, for a 25% discount I have to be realistic as well and go where the deal is. If they can't match the price they understand business is business, nothing personal."
895502,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-01 22:16:00,956,"How it going guys.  So hopefully I'm not the only guy here who supports those fishing stores down the street without that popular sign above there store like Canadian Tire and Walmart.  When fishing for tackle and other stuff I always head to my nearest fishing store not to just grab stuff, but to talk to the guys there.  They have a ton of knowledge that I'm sure CT and Walmart can't even compare too.  Imagine heading to CT and asking some kid where the fish are hitting.  Just my two cents."
895509,John Bacon,2015-02-01 22:58:00,3277,Or going to Canadian Tire or Walmart for minnows.  I think a lot of members like to support the small stores.  It does get mentioned occasionally in posts.
895511,davey buoy,2015-02-01 23:03:00,5505,Seems to depend on what is needed..Love the local guys !
895529,chris.brock,2015-02-02 00:42:00,4053,"CT moved in to Minden, and Jack sold Minden Live Bait and Tackle.  I remember walking in there one winter morning, there was the owner Jack, Brent Coltman, Rocky Crawford, Jack Prentice and myself. We all chatted. Priceless conversation! These guys are Haliburton back lake living legends. You don't get that at CT or Wally."
895534,bigugli,2015-02-02 01:38:00,6138," What!!!  He close up, or just sold to someone else? I remember when he first opened up in the early 80's on top the intersection. That would leave no shop from the 48 on up along the 35?"
895537,chris.brock,2015-02-02 01:55:00,4053,"That was John (slim, soft spoken guy) in the 80's at the corner. Another great guy. He sold to Jack and he moved it south of Highland Supply beside Boatwerks. Jack recently bailed and a younger couple bought it, it's still open, new owners, nice people, hopefully they do well."
895543,bigugli,2015-02-02 03:28:00,6138, I do hope they do well. It was the only shop left once Norland closed up. I trapped frogs for them long time back
895563,Garnet,2015-02-02 12:43:00,2056,I was into Minden Tackle week ago today. Nice guy and the minnow's were reasonable.
895613,wormdunker,2015-02-02 16:28:00,1711,"Count me in for shopping at the smaller local tackle shops.  Saturday morning on the way to our daughter & son in laws for a visit.  Lo & behold we were near Grimsby tackle - my truck suddenly took a hard left right into their parking lot!  Pheew, it was close!  So of course I go in chat with the boys - my wife elected to stay in the truck to do some urgently needed texting?  1/2 hour late I return with only 3 small lures.  Wife says ""they must be out of stock"".  So that's my funny for Saturday.  What did I purchase?  I knew you would want to know!  2 slab grabbers, 1 with a white bead, the other a red bead, & a small silver Williams, cause my other 2 are badly tarnished.  Oh the reason we headed in that direction was a garbage dump run - but she found her way to the truck!!  LOL!"
895614,wormdunker,2015-02-02 16:29:00,1711,I know - I got too much time on my hands.  Can't get out - 1' of new snow here in Niagara & still snowing & blowing.
895704,Sinker,2015-02-03 01:36:00,8692,"I get all my gear from the small guys. Ive been to bass pro 4 times. Left with nothing 3 times. The 4th time they replaced my worn out redhead socks lol  I go to BJ's bait and tackle for almost all my stuff. If he doesnt have it, he'll get it. Even boat parts, engine repairs, you name it.  On top of all that, its family run, and they treat me like a friend, not a customer. Its worth it for that alone.  S."
895708,Pigeontroller,2015-02-03 02:20:00,2793,"I support my local Canadian Tire, I'm always treated good there. I do not go there for fishing gear though! I don't think to many serious anglers are shopping for gear at a Canadian Tire."
895734,Yellow Fever,2015-02-03 12:18:00,139,"Most guys would love to support the smaller independent if they have them....problem is fishermen are wicked cheap for the most part. We have a good Canadian Tire here in Kingston ran by a good guy, and they are good corporate citizen ...always helping out the local fishing clubs etc. If I can get it local I will and pay the price but we all know someone who will drive to the states to save $10 and then ask CT to sponsor their kids hockey team!!!!!"
895739,Gerritt,2015-02-03 13:52:00,6129,I will second Kingstons CT.... What an awesome store compared to other CT's I have been in. I like shopping for stabby things while viewing thier aquarium....  G
895741,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-03 14:25:00,4399,isn't that the truth!!!
895898,wormdunker,2015-02-04 06:40:00,1711,Yellow fever- Your last sentence says it all!  And it's the truth!

It depends on the CTC store,our store in Belleville is well stocked with fishing ,last year alone they had 72x6ft of rubber products alone.High end rods and reels"

There are a number of smaller shops in my area of Scarborough and I drop in to see what they have in their clearance bins and to talk fishing/find out what's working. That kind of resource right on my doorstep is invaluable!"
895928,Gerritt,2015-02-04 13:54:00,6129,"True, Belleville does have a great CT as well with a huge outdoor dept. I wander around in there for hours.... No fish tank though lol  GP having any luck on the ice this year?  Seems everywhere is slow.... I have tried most of the usual haunts including Bain last weekend..... Thinking up heading up to Glen Ross this weekend to give it a go..  G"
895943,Garnet,2015-02-04 15:34:00,2056,"I always try to support the local guy. But if they don't have what I'm looking for Sail, BPS,CT and mail order no problem.  The CT in Kingston,Bellville,Coburg and Lindsay are all a cut above And the Wal Mart in North Bay."
895950,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-04 16:01:00,8243,"This was discussed a while back. Regardless we should always support our local guys, it's tough to make a living for any small Mom and Pop business. It is a more personal shopping experience. I always go to Bills Bait on Upper James in Hamilton, then Fishing World on Barton St. East second for sales, both an hours drive. I probably pass 3 CT and Wally Worlds to get there. The good folks at Bills will meet most sale prices if they have it in stock. If they don't have something they will order it for you. Try asking CT or Wally to do that? No one to ask anyway. I doubt the lady stocking shelves at those places has an opinion on fishing anyway. Most don't know the difference between a line counter and a line up at the counter. Support the little guy, please."
895977,Mister G,2015-02-04 17:07:00,1429,I support Cabela's because they ALWAYS stand behind everything they sell 100%.
895986,Lape0019,2015-02-04 17:24:00,647,"90% of my stuff comes from 1 store around the corner from where I live. He sells almost everything I need and has alright prices on most items.  For what he does not carry, it is either a trip to SAIL or I order online from TW."
895988,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-04 17:31:00,8243,"Mr G,  As does Bill's Bait, no questions asked. I lost a Reef Runner when the knot on the flouro/leadcore came apart that they tied for me when I bought the line there. I couldn't prove they tied it and I didn't even get the lure there and they retied the line and asked me to pick out any Reef Runner or any other comparable lure, no questions asked. Would Cabela's do that for you? I'm not sure. The one and only time I went to Bass Pro on my way to Newmarket I went online and found a good deal on a reel, when I asked for it they tell me that price is in USD, what a waste of time."

I am not sure if Cabela's would do that for me but here's a few times they stood up to the plate and hit it out of the park IMHO.  A 4.5 year old on-board charger with their name on it failed to work. Cabela's replaced it free of charge.  A 1.5 year old pair of THEIR waterproof low cut hiking shoes (I use them as my winter sneakers) a seem started to open up. Cabela's replaced them free of charge.  A 3 year old spinning rod broke. Cabela's replaced it free of charge.  A 5+ year old pair of mittens, expensive ones that are Gortex, plus have glove inserts and zippers so you can get a trigger finger out to make a important shot. Well the stitching was giving away right where the zipper was attached. Cabela's replaced them free of charge.  A LONG time ago my wife purchased me a expensive electronic trolling speed indicator for Christmas and it sat all winter until late spring to install it. I then tested it and found it was actually defective. Glad I didn't cut a hole in my dash and then find out it didn't work. I called Cabela's and explained it to them. No problem they said and refunded the full amount including the shipping cost.  The last time I visited their store I read a sign near the customer service desk that said their clothing with THEIR NAME on it has a lifetime warranty.  It don't get no better then this IMHO."
