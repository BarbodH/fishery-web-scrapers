896363,wormdunker,2015-02-06 08:59:00,1711,Pretty neat rig.  For certain back lakes - great idea!
896374,ckewley,2015-02-06 12:44:00,699,"Pretty neat idea, a buddy of mine has a Fold-a-boat or something to that effect but it is not as transportable as this thing"
896426,4x4bassin,2015-02-06 17:35:00,1025,"That is pretty slick , can you imagine the water you could fish with that setup Anyone know a cost of one of these units ?"
896428,ckewley,2015-02-06 17:42:00,699,I saw an on-line price of $3000.00 but they are at the Sportsman Show so I'll check to see if that is correct
896455,bare foot wader,2015-02-06 20:32:00,1354,"http://predatorplastics.com/page10.html  is this the same company?   when I first saw these last year I was immediately ready to buy, and they actually had stock at a local dealer and checked them out, pretty cool, seems sturdy and highly useful...but the local price was 3,599...it's just way too expensive"
896464,Joeytier,2015-02-06 21:30:00,3990,You can buy an ATV trailer and a good quality older 12 footer for less than what that costs.
896466,Fisherman,2015-02-06 21:46:00,7201,"I can just imagine, the holding open clip lets go, giver gas and the dm thing folds shut with you inside..."
896477,4x4bassin,2015-02-06 23:03:00,1025,"Wow , that's a bit pricey don't you think , as Joeytier said you can buy a quad trailer and used 12 ft aluminum for $1500"
896478,bare foot wader,2015-02-06 23:08:00,1354,"Wow , that's a bit pricey don't you think , as Joeytier said you can buy a quad trailer and used 12 ft aluminum for $1500  exactly what we ended up doing   the folding aspect is nice, but 3k for a piece of plastic is insane...if it was priced around 1K it would likely be a better seller"
896494,misfish,2015-02-07 00:19:00,29133,"It,s pretty much what I was given by one of my uncles many years ago. it looked like a suit case. Strapped it to the top of my ole chevet. LOL  It was a trunk that was 4'x4'x4'. It was held together with a 4' hinge. I fished and duck hunted out of it."
