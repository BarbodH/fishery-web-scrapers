That's crazy considering Selkirk was the ""Gas Town"" of Ontario for years. Still have Gasfest. Anyway Featherstone Ted signed a contract in October for 59 cents/lt. They were paying over 90 last year with no contract. All it took was a phone call to tell the provider to come and get the tank and they renegotiated the price to meet the competitors.

896341,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-06 03:26:00,8243,"By reading the amount of wood some have you gone through it tells me this winter has been colder than last year. Last year was the coldest down south here that I can remember. There were a few nights that I stayed up and filled every container, jug, mug, glass, did every piece of laundry and wasted a load of water to run the pump every 25 minutes. We had 60 knot winds blowing off the lake. If I waited 30 minutes there was slush in the line from the cistern. It was the coldest night in my life save for a few crazy nights at E Blast Furnace keeping every known fluid known to man from freezing, including Hot Metal at 2700F, freezing is 2300F. This year has been a walk in the park, a warm park compared to last winter, so far. I have insulated this place to the max. That in a nutshell is the key to thermal efficiency. Creating a thermal break is paramount to fuel efficiency. Without a true thermal break you would be surprised at the heat loss. I have been thinking about pulling off the siding and spraying the perimeter 100% with closed cell isostyrene insulation. I walk around here with a smoke flare checking for leaks as this place moves up and down back and forth during the crazy high winds here on the point. A good heat loss survey could save you folks thousands in the long run knowing where to tighten up and insulate. 30% of heat loss is through the floor. If you don't need shoes or slippers in the winter and bare feet are cool in the summer you are almost half way to energy efficiency.  I heat 1200 sqft of ground floor with around $130.00 per month in Natural Gas including stove, hot water, dryer and BBQ, and supplement cold nights with 2 oil filled electric portables at 600W during the night, 900 to 1200 on -20c plus wind, and there are nights 1500W is a must. Those nights we sleep in the loft where it's 75F. If it were not for the spiral staircase and my weak bladder we would be up there every night like 5 years ago. We know when to head up there, when the cat does we do. Then I turn the electrics to the lowest settings.  I don't read where or what you guys do to insulate or provide wind protection at your properties. A few strategically planted pines, dense cedar  and spruce can do amazing things to break down wind flow that will result in energy savings that would amaze you over the years. My neighbor cut down a row of cedars that blocked the SW wind coming off lake a few summers ago due to the view. He was latter amazed to find how cold the cottage  was that next winter, a better view though. I have a partner too that gets 1 more vote than I do."
896346,Gerritt,2015-02-06 03:51:00,6129,That sounds a bit extreme to heat your place in the winter.... I am curious about its construction and why you need electric to supplement your furnace  G
896348,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-06 04:17:00,8243,"We don't have a furnace. The primary heat source is a 45,000 BTU gas fireplace. No duct work. I just can't get the heat to the back rooms. Is $130.00 a month in NG considering all appliances except the fridge extreme? It's very , very cold here on the shoreline of Erie with that wind blowing hard, constantly. The lakeside gable end is more windows than walls. That's a killer but why look over the lake if you can't see it? Hydro is around $90.00 a month in winter and less than $90.00 in summer with 1 old window unit and a portable A/C unit. Gas in summer is less than $30.00.  Seldom are the 2 electric units cranked, I often shut them off when we get up in the AM. I would have had to tear out new exterior and interior walls to put in forced air as code calls for 4"" ductwork and the walls are only 4"" thick (true dimensional 2X4). It was a tough decision but we would have lost valuable space for the furnace, trunkline and returns upstairs. I never ever thought we move here full time. Some nights and hot humid days I question the why didn't I but can live with it. It is a storey and a half balloon construction and I blew in isostyrene between the 2X4 studs and in the 2X6 ceiling but can do better by furring out the exterior walls with 2X4's , spraying the walls and creating a full thermal break.  .  edit, I just asked my wife how much the last bill was and she said Decembers was $115.00. She said if I paid a bill once and a while I would know, smarty pants. So Januarys would be close at 130. I don't dare ask her exactly what Hydro is.  Edit again, 07:00 AM. I always say if you don't know what the price of tatters are don't go into the French Fry biz. Yea Hydro is $90.00 a month, in October, Try $255.00 for the bill I just looked at for January. Can anyone tell me what a ""clean energy credit"" is and why there is a 10% credit for it? Does it apply to everyone?"

896393,wormdunker,2015-02-06 14:18:00,1711,"Very good info here.  Thanx for sharing.  Please explain ""thermal break"".  I have 2200 square feet of living space not including the basement.  My NG bill is $135.00 per month year round.  My furnace (5 year old Carrier high efficiency), dryer, hot water tank & BBQ are on NG.  Electricity bill is $85.00 per month.  Our house is well insulated (I installed it), attic has 12"" blown in.  I feel my gas & electricity bills are OK.  For 25 years I burned 12 - 15 face cord of wood per season.  I was fortunate to get most of my wood for free - except for the labor which was OK while I was younger.  I haven't burned wood for 3 years & find the basement floor very cold.  OH - airtight was in the basement family room.  So it was very cozy while burning wood.  Another question - Is the ""dry core"" sub floor worth the expense?  That's the 2' x 2' squares with the plastic dimples against the concrete.  I want to finally finish off the lower basement (laundry & mechanical room).  Is dry core the solution or should I use 1 1/2"" styro  SM in between 2x4s laid flat for a sub floor?  Please comment."
896442,bigbuck,2015-02-06 18:51:00,2449,"Dunker, you can use the plastic dimpled membrane they use to protect foundations on new homes. It comes in a big roll, roll it out to size, cover with tongue and groove plywood and nail down with concrete nails. Cheaper and same thing pretty much. We did that in my basement and the floor is nice and warm."
896470,wormdunker,2015-02-06 22:03:00,1711,"big buck - thanx, I'll definitely look into that.  I priced out the styro SM, 2x4s & 9/16"" T & G & believe it or not the drycore was a little cheaper.  I'll crunch some numbers & let you know.  Your idea sounds better due to buying the waterproof membrane in bulk."
896482,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-06 23:29:00,8243,"wormdunker I have used Dri-Core with good results. It will not give you an R value of any great degree but if your floor is below the frost line it is not imperative to insulate that floor. It will save your flooring from damage due to minor basement leaks, not floods, because it allows the water to drain between the dimples to the drain below. No hardwood or ceramics should be laid on Dri Core. I have never used the basement foundation membrane, make sure it is safe for indoor application, not all materials are.  A fantastic explanation for Thermal break is in  Wikipedia under Thermal break. (sorry this site won't allow me to cut and paste).  Simply a break is where any substance or material that isolates  the building envelope and the elements. Inert gas between 2 panes of glass is a Thermal break. Caulking between the window frame and the window itself is a Thermal break. Insulation of any kind between dimensional lumber does not create a Thermal break. Think of this, I have a wall constructed of 2X6's, there is no insulation on either side of the interior or exterior of the 2X6 when we traditionally insulate in this fashion. Add up all the 2X6's that have zero insulation on either side of the interior or exterior of the 2X6. Now put all the 2X6's that are on all 4 or more exterior walls side by side. Depending on the length of the walls imagine how much linear space has only house wrap, vapour barrier, 5.5""  of softwood and sheathing between you and the exterior weather. zero insulation. Same goes for Cathedral ceilings where trusses are 16"" on centre. That's a lot of uninsulated home. Spray insulation on the entire exterior wall and you have a thermal break."
896531,ch312,2015-02-07 03:49:00,1590,"You can most definitely put tile or hardwood over Dricore, assuming you follow their instructions for fastening the panels properly and using the proper underlay. With tile you'd use normal tile backer board of your choice and for hardwood you'd lay plywood first."
896539,wormdunker,2015-02-07 08:59:00,1711,"Excellent info here - thanx for your input.  Ironmaker - You explained the thermal break very well.  Thanx. I can definitely see where there is no insulation value if you were to push all the framing members tight to one another.   I'll investigate the use of foundation material for interior use as well.  I don't agree with your statement  'below the frost line is not imperative to insulate that floor.""  Right now that part of the basement floor is very cold.  To demonstrate to wifey - I placed a piece of styro SM on the floor.  Instructed her to stand on the concrete with bare feet for a minute or so - Now stand on the piece of styro.  I think you know the answer. Now add a layer of T & G plywood & lets say laminate flooring - even better!   I've read a lot as you spread your ""words of wisdom"" to the OFC members.  LOL! ch312 - I did read where it is acceptable to lay laminate, hardwood or tile on drycore.  Thanx for your input.  Now stop typing & go catch some fish!!  That goes for you as well Ironmaker!"

They get it from Sarnia and have it trucked up here.  I mentioned earlier in this thread that my tank was topped up yesterday at $1.05/litre so if your getting it for $0.95 you're getting a good deal, but maybe it's better to pay the premium and be assured of delivery.  As for my thermostat setting, I keep it at 74F as that's a temperature I like and find comfortable and even in the hot summer days I set the AC at 74 also. When I'm outside in the summer months I find low to mid 70's most comfortable so I keep the house the same.  No way I want to sit in the house all winter wearing a sweater and long pants with the thermostat set in the low 60's to save a few $$$$  I have an airtight downstairs in the family room and run that alot thru the winter and when it's burning it sends enough warm air up the stairs that it exceeds the thermostat setting and shuts the furnace down.

832615,aplumma,2014-01-25 20:29:00,6896,Not sure what type of heat pump you have experience with but mine was great cooled the air in the summer and provided heat in the shoulder seasons and still provided heat down to minus 20 celsius. The great thing that I found is that in the shoulder seasons it provided great efficiency of 4 to 1 and of course as the temp drops so does the efficiency. Best money I ever spent. The cooling aspect of a heat pump is excellent it is the heating season that is it's downfall. There is a finite amount of heat available for it to scavenge from the air. The process of scavenging the heat produces heat from the compressor and the small amount it gets from the air then needs to be supplemented with aux heat. Once the unit get to cold it goes into a defrost cycle where it uses electricity to thaw out the coil and this heat is lost for the most part as it is in defrost cycle but a small amount is recovered as it starts the cycle of savaging heat. They are no worse than a gas furnace but the laws of physics has made the efficiency of them not the first choice in areas that see temperatures below 34F . At 32 F you have only 160 btu available to change of state ice to water 20 C you are getting little to no  heat from the outside air. Even if you get 100% efficiency from a system(so far not possible) physics work against you in the colder regends. If the price of electricity is less expensive than gas (not the case down here in the USA) then I could see it as a wash scenario with the negative of more moving parts to break and trained technicians for a system that I suspect is not sold that often. Don't get me wrong it is wonderful technology and it has come far from even units 10 years old but would not be my first choice as we move North.   Art
832621,crappieperchhunter,2014-01-25 20:47:00,2582,"The cost for fuel is brutal these days. 25 years ago, electric heat was the way to go, 10 years ago, oil was very cheap (40 cents/ltr, now 1.10), propane a few years ago and even that has skyrocketed. This is why we decided to close the cottage for the winter. It has electric baseboards and a woodstove, it is ok when you are burning wood but when the baseboards are going, the meter spins outrageously fast. Our neighbours laid in 3 bushcords of firewood in the fall to help defray the cost of oil in their furnace, they are almost 3/4 the way through their firewood already. stay warm folks and hopefully we all have a few bucks stashed under our old playboy mags like Lew to help pay for the added cost of fuel during this 1970's type winter.

Art I am sure you have some basis for your numbers but in my case the new technology from Mitsubishi worked wonderfully right down to minus 20c. This winter has seen some extreme temperatures but the historical average temperature in my neck of the woods averages -8c or so in the winter and the Mits was giving heat quite comfortably. In the case of Mr. Crappieperchunter with a small one floor cottage the Mits would be a no brainer in my opinion. The Europeans have been using this technology for some time but we in North America are a little slow at grasping new technology as is usually the case. Interestingly when I bought mine the main reason I bought the unit was for AC as the house was a little sweat box and with no ducting it was the only real choice. This unit was incredible for cooling the house just put the unit on dehumidify and Bob`s your uncle, far more efficient than a central unit trying to push cold air where it does not want to go! In our case a small two storey well insulated with good windows we never turned on the baseboards, we had a gas fireplace in the basement which radiated heat up which helped in heating the first floor. Our utility costs all in were in the 225/month range. Everybody's situation is different but it is a technology that people should start looking at....if I had a 1000 sq.ft. or so bungalow/cottage it would be a no brainer, if your paying the kind of numbers that some people are throwing around here the unit would pay for itself in no time!!!"

Now my back doesn't like it as much anymore but it is still the most excersize I get all year. After a few weeks of working at it my back actually starts to improve as the muscles develop. Nothing beats wood heat IMO. Everyone just loves to stand beside the wood stove and soak it in.  Cheers   Agree 100%"
839000,lew,2014-02-28 15:18:00,12766,I payed $1.05 / litre for my home propane on January 24th and just had my tank filled this morning and it's dropped to $0.96 so at least we're heading in the right direction for a change.
839003,Lape0019,2014-02-28 15:47:00,647,"LOL,  Last year, our fill ups were between $0.67 a litre and $0.79 a litre. This year, January's bill was $1.09 a litre and six weeks later, we are at $0.99 a litre. I agree it is great it is going down, but I sure hope it drops more than that for my next fill up.  The sad thing is at $1.09 a litre, I was only 3 cents cheaper than my buddy who heats with oil! And for some reason, I have always found houses heated with oil feel warmer and stay warmer longer. My funrace seems to kick on at least twice as much as his does."
839004,Big Cliff,2014-02-28 15:50:00,6899,Just had mine filled testerday $0.999
832433,manjo39,2014-01-24 20:54:00,354,Just got my propane bill on Jan 21.  $579 to fill my tanks after two months! Don't want to see my March bill after these deep freezes.  
832439,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-24 21:10:00,4399,Not sure the style/size of house you have but you might want to look into a air source heat pump.  That`s one thing I don`t miss with the house being gone the upkeep and energy bills!!!
832440,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-24 21:12:00,10439,I do two fills per year for my tank. Between $800-$900 per fill. I think the current price is around $0.89/L. You don't seem to have it too bad.
832461,aplumma,2014-01-24 22:55:00,6896,We are cheaper down here if you prepay under contract it is 1.99 a gallon. Don't bother with a heat pump they are for temperatures above 34 F after that they are junk IMHO.    Art
832468,fishindevil,2014-01-24 23:37:00,6254,They just said on the news that propane will probly be  $1.05 to $1.10 per liter very soon that it has not peaked in price yet !!!! And the sinking dollar and high demand is making it happen !!!! Not gonna get any better either just look at electricity prices as well .... It sucks
832470,irishfield,2014-01-24 23:40:00,26272,"Yep they're propagating a propane shortage...  .. still trade you for my oil fill today, last filled Dec 30th,  at $838.63 and I've also burnt 2 full face cords of oak and maple in the same time frame as well. The joys of having to keep the house at 23.5C so Jen's comfy."
832474,misfish,2014-01-24 23:49:00,29133,"  Just think Wayne. You got a good work out,and your keeping the loved ones warm,,,,,,,,,,,   PRICELESS BUD."
832475,Sinker,2014-01-24 23:51:00,8692,"I've burned more wood already than I burned all last winter. Had to bring two more BUSH cords into the wood shed this week. I hope that's enough!! If I cound my hours of cutting/splitting/stacking firewood, I'm probably further behind than guys running oil/propane.  S."
832484,Entropy,2014-01-25 00:16:00,747,propane shortage?  Next thing you know we'll be going to war with the U.S. ....  LOL
832485,Entropy,2014-01-25 00:17:00,747,"propane shortage?  Next thing you know we'll be going to war with the U.S. ....  LOL   I hear ya on the wood, I think by the end of Feb I could be out. Lots of homes in Ontario have reported going through a pile more fuel and wood than normal.  "

832490,lew,2014-01-25 00:27:00,12766,You've got a great memory Brian
832495,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-25 00:40:00,4399,Not sure what type of heat pump you have experience with but mine was great  cooled the air in the summer and provided heat in the shoulder seasons and still provided heat down to minus 20 celsius. The great thing that I found is that in the shoulder seasons it provided great efficiency of 4 to 1 and of course as the temp drops so does the efficiency.  Best money I ever spent.
832496,Fisherman,2014-01-25 00:42:00,7201,"Then I guess I can't grumble, $176 for the last 2 months on NG for furnace, hot water, dryer and back yard garage.  We had the exterior of the house resided with an extra 1 inch foam sheet underneath. Added about another 8-10 inches of blown in insulation in the attic too."
832501,icedude,2014-01-25 01:22:00,459,Keep it  a 'Balmy' 17 here as well--Fuel oil in a 2500 square foot living space was running us approx $3K a year-albeit not a terribily well insulated century home  Converted to high efficiency gas--halfed the cost roughly  Shop has a wood burning stove and supplemental heating when required  It's a damn cold winter on the south shores of Lake Simcoe--Good for making ICE  Paul www.perchinforms.com      Stay Warm All
832503,bigbuck,2014-01-25 01:27:00,2449,"My NG bill will probably be about 150 this month. Since I replaced my windows a few yers ago, I noticed a big drop in my gas bill. Hydro is a different story. Stay warm folks. This is a real winter. We have had it easy for a long time. I hope all of you heating with wood have enough. My last few dry logs went into the fireplace tonight. I have almost a full cord of mixed hardwood from the ice storm that is nice and wet and has to wait till next winter. I'm going by a buddies place tomorrow to pick up some dry applewood. Never burned that before. It is supposed to be pretty good."
832504,bigugli,2014-01-25 01:31:00,6138,Have to admit this is one year I don't miss hauling wood for the fire. Most folks I know who heat with wood are about 25% over their normal rate of burn. A few are going to run short.
832505,bigugli,2014-01-25 01:33:00,6138,". I have almost a full cord of mixed hardwood from the ice storm that is nice and wet and has to wait till next winter.

832507,porkpie,2014-01-25 01:40:00,2521,I guess I won't complain about my $70 a month gas bills for my little bungalow.
832517,bigbuck,2014-01-25 03:14:00,2449,"Actually, the applewood I am getting is about 3 years old. He has some oak in there too so yippee!!! Free firewood is always good."

I had to clear a section of orchard a number of years back. Wound up with 40 facecords of fruitwoods sitting in my yard for 2 years"
832529,bigbuck,2014-01-25 04:23:00,2449,"The cost for fuel is brutal these days. 25 years ago, electric heat was the way to go, 10 years ago, oil was very cheap (40 cents/ltr, now 1.10), propane a few years ago and even that has skyrocketed. This is why we decided to close the cottage for the winter. It has electric baseboards and a woodstove, it is ok when you are burning wood but when the baseboards are going, the meter spins outrageously fast. Our neighbours laid in 3 bushcords of firewood in the fall to help defray the cost of oil in their furnace, they are almost 3/4 the way through their firewood already. stay warm folks and hopefully we all have a few bucks stashed under our old playboy mags like Lew to help pay for the added cost of fuel during this 1970's type winter."
832530,irishfield,2014-01-25 04:37:00,26272,"Bigbuuck... just pull the main and don't worry about the place or the chance squirrels might short a wire out while you're absent. Decide to go up for the weekend.. just throw the main back in and the place will be up to heat in under 4 hours, less if you throw a few logs in the fire. What we do in Temagami... and it was comfy with slippers in 3 hours on New Years Eve when it was -32C outside! Leave.. pull the main and go home!  Oh.. do you have a '81 with Shannon Tweed as a natural women?"
