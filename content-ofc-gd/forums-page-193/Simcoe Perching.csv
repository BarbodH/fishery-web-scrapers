896581,Hellfish,2015-02-07 16:44:00,308,So after looking into operators for Feb 16 and the reports I have been getting I am not confident at all about what I am hearing. I am thinking of booking with Terry Goy but all the reports I have heard are all little perch. I have all the equipment I need to be successful out there just not sure where to go if I was to head out without a operator. Can anyone give any good suggestions? Thanks in advance

I was thinking of heading up to daves fishing huts in Jackson point.  They have 2 packages.  whitefish and lake trout, or perch and pike?  Which is the best one to go with?  I would like to go with the lake trout and and whitefish, but since its my first time going, I would rather go for the one that will likely catch something (ie not get skunked)."
