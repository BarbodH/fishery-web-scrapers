I will be going down probably around February 10th or so and looking at the prices Scottsdale seems to be a fair bit more expensive so I am not sure it is worth paying the difference?  I will be driving down and the wife and daughter will fly down and my daughter will only stay for a week and then fly back the wife will stay and then we will drive back.  Any suggestions on which location and / or any suggestions on where to stay?  Also anybody have a place they rent out?  Thanks,  FLEX - John"

895765,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-03 16:35:00,8243,"I can tell you from my experience that Scottsdale is a very expensive bedroom community with not much going on but golf. 50 courses in a low population community. I really didn't know it was a tourist destination except for golf. not much to do but visit the desert and a few bars and restaurants that can be very pricey. Only been once golfing, people that live there think and act like they live in L.A. one local I golfed with told us. Real Hoity toity."

I'm guessing Scottsdale would be the nicer, classier neighborhood since it has higher prices.  It depends on what you like to do, but I thought the Sedona area was the most scenic with lots of hiking trails. I'm guessing it's expensive though.  I love the desert. It seems so foreign to anywhere I've been in Canada."

895817,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-03 21:26:00,8243,"I think I miss interpreted the request.  If anywhere in Arizona Sedona is the place to visit. It all depends on budget, it is not in my budget."
