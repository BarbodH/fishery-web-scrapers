It's a 30"" medium action rod i purchased primarily for walleye. On my first day out the ice was only about 4"" and as usual, the Thames River was dirty with about 6"" of visibility. I tossed on a size 6 fire tiger rippin rap tipped with a shiner and after a bit, i marked a suspended fish about 5ft off the bottom. I reeled right up to it and next thing i felt was just weight followed by numerous head shakes. It was a beautiful 24"" 5.5lb walleye and the picture taken couldn't of been more perfect with the sun peeking out.  The picture was submitted for an ice contest and i was lucky enough to make on the top 10.
