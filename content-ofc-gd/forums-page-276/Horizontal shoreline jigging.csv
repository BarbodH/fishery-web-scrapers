LOL  With all the shiners around this year (anyone that thinks Simcoe is not healthy,think again.) Trillions of shiners every where here. Stupid crazy.  Anywhere there were clouds of them,the bite was real bad. I moved to 4 different spots,and there they were. I thought just maybe,find an area that had a good deep drop off,they wouldnt be there.  I found a spot,but there were some shiners around,but nothing like the clouds of them I had seen at the other spots.  Started off with a craw tube on a slip float. Set it at 20 ft. The odd hit. There were a couple of other anglers in the area and they were having the same results.  I look in the bag and find a small ice fishing spoon jig. I think ok,replace the micro tube with the jig and vertical jig. After my first cast out,the jig was to heavy for the float.  So,lets try this. Just the small spoon jig, I removed the side hooks.Cast out,let it flutter down,twitch the rod reel up a bit. Repeat. And repeat again,line jerks out,fish on. There were no real bigg,ns,all about the size of this one. Lots of them. Even managed a few juvy herring. Surprise.Sorry,no pics of OOS fish.    I continued to use this pattern and it worked all morning. I had a few of the other anglers ask what the heck I was doing. I was more then happy to show them,and one guy says,I got one of those. He set up and he was on to them too.  Water has gotten colder which is nice. Think,n when I get out in the tube again,it will be winter woolys under the track pants..BRRRRR.  At one point this morning,a hoard of cormerans came in. The local terns and gulls werent to happy.    "

813989,BillM,2013-10-20 18:28:00,17367,"Casting jigging spoons has been a killer smallie pattern for me this season.  Find the bait, find the fish!    Gotta love marking those giant bait balls with those green streaks all through them."
813995,davey buoy,2013-10-20 18:51:00,5505,"Good to hear you caught some fish,thinking outside the box.! I never think to hit the lakeshore and give it a go.Will have to keep that in my back pocket."
814020,misfish,2013-10-20 20:12:00,29133, I was on SHORE. LMAO  But I hear ya Bill. LOL
814028,BillM,2013-10-20 20:39:00,17367," I was on SHORE. LMAO  But I hear ya Bill. LOL  Well yeah, but the pattern is the same.   You definitely don't need a boat to casting jigging spoons"
814034,mike rousseau,2013-10-20 20:47:00,4661,When I was little I never used a float for crappie fishing.... Ultra light with a small tube or Swimbait reeled slowly... Key was the lightest jig possible that could be cast the distance needed...
