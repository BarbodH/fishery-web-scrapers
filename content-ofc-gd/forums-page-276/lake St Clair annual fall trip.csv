813083,outllaw,2013-10-16 12:31:00,1232,I talked to a big musky the other day. she said wheres that SQUID guy.
813237,Squid,2013-10-16 23:43:00,1656,LOL French river with MCI and my son and then its all LSC George!!
813254,Handlebarz,2013-10-17 01:06:00,3790,Ronnie you don't need to explain we all know you needed some food as you can not live on all you can eat ribs and you can't take the extra with you.  I'm sure that every weekend there are a bunch of OFC members that will be pounding LSC. This weekend is no different. If anyone is heading down and staying in Chatham and you love BBQ then head over to blazin BBQ on st.clair street it's a awesome place.  Shoot me a pm if you want to meet up.
808132,Squid,2013-09-17 12:10:00,1656,"For the past 5 yrs a group of us, changes every year, go down to lake St.Clair for the weekend to fish for spotties. Is there any interest in having a G2G this yr in Belle River?Probably in October 2013."
808133,Sinker,2013-09-17 12:11:00,8692,"I do a trip down there every fall, but in Nov.....for ducks. Have a great trip!  S."

808175,outllaw,2013-09-17 16:24:00,1232,stop bye pete. you did make my day last trip. im still chuckiling. mike reminded me the other day.
808178,Locnar,2013-09-17 16:37:00,645,Spotties?? Another slang for Largemouths?
808182,mike rousseau,2013-09-17 16:49:00,4661,Spotted musky
808185,Squid,2013-09-17 17:02:00,1656,Sorry Yeah they are called spotties in the LSC area. Ok George we can swing by as I want to show my son your workshop.
808186,Squid,2013-09-17 17:03:00,1656,I am looking at the end of October/ beginning of November for this trip. We will be fishing righ up to the closing date again this yr. last year we managed over ten fish in the two outing days in December during the last week of musky fishing.
808203,Handlebarz,2013-09-17 18:50:00,3790,Pete I might be able to make it lol  And yes them are awesome tires

808379,Squid,2013-09-18 19:21:00,1656,Maybe we could target the weekend of November 1st?
808446,Ron,2013-09-19 03:04:00,1683,"My buddy keith and I will keep it in mind. It might work out, depends on whether I'm on call for that weekend or not."
808462,Squid,2013-09-19 13:49:00,1656,Ok Ron we re-up this thread as we get closer. I will be going there most weekends until close anyways
808524,Rizzo,2013-09-20 00:25:00,4754,I got a 2 day trip planned for early to mid Oct...so I should be due for at least a day trip by early November! If I'm off I'll come for the day
808627,Whopper,2013-09-20 18:39:00,2174,Count me in also
808633,outllaw,2013-09-20 19:11:00,1232,whopper bring perch fillets. betcha thought I forgot eh. thanks again lol.
808693,Whopper,2013-09-21 02:57:00,2174,
808708,Handlebarz,2013-09-21 11:42:00,3790,We can go to Captain Nicks for dinner as its not usually busy and has a lot of seating right at the boat launch. Even if you cant fish that weekend but are in the area be sure to stop by as it is a good time.  One other thing to think about booking at the yacht club as there are docks right outside your room and you can bunk a bunch of guys in it instead of just two from what I hear. its around $100 a night
812591,Handlebarz,2013-10-13 13:11:00,3790,IS there any trips planned for you guys yet? How about just guys coming down I know every weekend there have been guys down that I get to meet up with and enjoy dinner or just a visit to get caught up with. The weekend of the 2nd should be good with the New moon out.
812680,Ron,2013-10-13 22:22:00,1683,"We are interested Mike and Pete.  Just hoping my ""tennis elbow"" is healed up by then. I had to stoop so low as to fish for Perch and bass this weekend!"
812710,Handlebarz,2013-10-14 01:39:00,3790,The weekend of November 16th is out for me my sons bday weekend. I will be fishing a bit but have to be home for the afternoon party.
812872,Rizzo,2013-10-15 00:09:00,4754,Well I have my mid oct trip planned...its this week. Let me know what dates you choose and hopefully I can make it!
