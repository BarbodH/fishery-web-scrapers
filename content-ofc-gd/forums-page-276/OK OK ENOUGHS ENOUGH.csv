813634,Fishnwire,2013-10-19 02:01:00,983,"I come here almost every day.  I almost never post in the ""fishing"" threads, because there's usually nothing I can add that someone hasn't already.  To be honest, I forget the last time I actually learned something here that I didn't already know.  I have zero interest in anything about centre pins, salmon, fishing tribs, etc, and there's a lot of that here.  Basically if it wasn't for the non-fishing threads, I probably wouldn't come here.  The locked threads are (for me anyway) by far the most interesting threads on this site.  Whenever I see a thread is locked, I always click on it.  Often I wonder why it was locked and think the only possibility is ""too entertaining"".  That's on those occasions when the obvious reason for the lock isn't ""too embarrassing to conservatives"".  Hey-oh!  This thread will be locked."
813635,manitoubass2,2013-10-19 02:11:00,11391,I tend to end threads with my lacklaster comments.

813638,pike slayer,2013-10-19 02:26:00,1177,i have to agree with fishNwire. thats why i come on here to. and i like to see the odd fishing reports from guys like moosebunk. the only time anything should get locked here is if someone is posting porn or straight up threatening a fellow member on here.
813648,jbailey,2013-10-19 08:40:00,866,agreed. I come here to read fishing reports but have been sucked into other various posts. Its evident that threads get shut down for personal reasons or disagreements with statements. Kind of sad really. Used to be a resourceful site for FISHING and now its just a joke.
813660,Roy,2013-10-19 11:56:00,13728,"I have too much to do today. Busier than a 3 legged cat burying a turd on a frozen pond. I'll be back sometime today to add my 2 cents to this thread. In the meantime, food for thought: Ours is the busiest fishing community in Canada (real numbers) so we should all be proud as contributors to our success. Those who don't like it here  ahhh what can I say, you're still here so I'm not worried. Anyhow, gotta get some stuff done, back as soon as I can.  ps. Brian, you should have marked the thread ""NF"".  Toodles."
813674,aplumma,2013-10-19 13:24:00,6896,"While we wait for Roy to return I will add my .02 cents worth. What the members see on a thread is not all of the information that the Moderators see. We see the reports from members that alert us to a thread that is breaking the rules. We see the comments that we remove that are inflaming the threads. We then have just a few minutes to make a decision on will this thread be corrupted again or will it fly straight without consuming our time. We all have lives to live we get the fact that every one wants to be the hero of the internet and say the right thing and have people hang onto our every word. It will not happen on either end some of the members will always be disappointed with the way the forum is moderated and the moderators will once again ask themselves why do I keep this site open when all we get is kicked in the balls again and again and again.  Food for thought folks  this is not a money maker for us I make over $100.00 an hour as a Company owner and Master Plumber the time I share with this board and the people are because I love the people and the community it has grown into. If you think it is a power trip for me to lock a thread your world is to small in any given day, the decisions I make at work on one job affect  projects with costs that affect both people and business that could buy and sell the net worth of this board 20 times a day.  Winter is coming and we allow a little more lateral in this season but realize it does not mean you can break the rules. Keep in mind as you bash the moderators that we are people to and when the last one of us says ""Uncle"" the light will be turned off.  Thanks for reading my rant I am glad I asked Roy to watch over this thread My first impulse was to lock it down, he has taken a better course of action. I am grateful both for his knowledge and tact.  Art"

Sorry if I called you out Roy,but you seem to make sense of things and understand some posts that go a stray.

813582,Big Cliff,2013-10-18 22:26:00,6899,"Is this a fishing form or a fishing person (being politically correct here)! A fishing form should be limited to fishing (roughly 15% of the threads here). A fishing person form should be open for a wide variety of discussions on a wide variety of topics. We are people, we love, dream, think, discuss and sometimes we disagree but we always respect others opinions.  Sometimes I think threads get locked when they shouldn't but this isn't my board and I have a choice of coming here or not.  If you don't like the way things are run, you have the right to say so and you also have the right to go somewhere else. I know there have been a few times I have taken a break but in the long run I find that for any negitive there are plenty of positives."

The last thing you ever want to do, is discuss anything meaningful or helpful about actual fishing spots or situations.

I also want to say that moderating a forum of this size is not easy. Roy and Art do most of the work. And they do a fantastic job imho. Sometimes decisions are discussed in the mods forum. Sometimes not. Never will a decision please everyone. I'm sure that if the decision were up to you Brian, you would have locked a thread or two over the years too. Which ones? And why? Not that easy, is it?"

We have the ability here to give detailed information by personal messaging for someone that asks for specifics. If someone takes the time to ask me via a PM I'm more than willing to help if I can.  I personally don't think politics on a fishing forum is necessary. However if one comes up I tend to follow the thread. If only to gauge the pulse of the everyman here in Ontario and beyond as to how they feel about our government(s). I'm the kind of taxpayer that loves reading Letters to the Editor from the rural weekly newspapers, not the big city rags where everyone is a political pundit. It gives me a feel how the "" average taxpayer"" really feels.  It's the inconsistencies in threads being locked is what gets people going. What in heavens name does a 20 page thread about hockey, the Maple Leafs have to do with fishing? I'll tell you, people are interested in it. There is a long going thread that a fellow member has about the tragic story of an ailing child. There is plenty of politics in that thread, plenty. The health care or uncare system, our reps in Queens Park and Parliament Hill I believe. I may be mistaken and if I am I apologize.  The common denominator is just that, the common denominator, us and our opinions. Many before us and even today have given their lives in order for us to voice our opinions here or anywhere would be disgusted to know that someone, anyone can arbitrarily censor our opinions  Having said that trollers and those that are vile, disruptive, prejudice, sexist, need not apply here. Even an anus has an opinion, everyone has one."
813630,FloatnFly,2013-10-19 00:53:00,1640,you know its funny how a mild conversation about a police officer getting what he deserved gets locked but yet a heated discussion about roe harvesting or government spending remains open
