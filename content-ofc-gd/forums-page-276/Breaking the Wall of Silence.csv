Saturday was all but a bust due to the rain and only managed about 45 minutes on the water with nothing to show for it.  Wake up Sunday morning with the intention of catching up on the fall clean up, my boy asks if I'm planning on hitting the water and after a little push I let him talk me into heading out.  Hook up the tin and make the 5 minute trek to the local harbour. With light winds, clear skies and the sun beaming we were the only boat on the water so it was almost perfect, except for the front that made its way in the night before.  The first hour was spent tossing a dropshot, cranks and jigs and even a few spoons looking for Smallies and/or Salmon which looked promising given the third cast of the dropshot managed to lift a Sammy that shook the hook. Fished up one side of the outer break wall to the pier head and back down the inner wall with nothing willing to accept our offerings.  Shoot across once again to where the Sammy hit and found some sparse weed growth  on a flat off the outer break wall when my sons' rod doubled over. After a short fight a Pike appeared, was netted and released. For the next hour we tangled with a wolf pack that saw 6 Pike caught, 3 spit hooks, one break-off and more than a few follows. No Smallies or Salmon netted on this day but an unexpected and welcomed surprise as the Break Wall spoke and we listened to every word. Thanks for your persistence son. Perfect day after all.  First in the Wolf Pack to surrender  Weighed in at 14.54 lbs  lbs? Your guess is as good as mine. "
814094,Joeytier,2013-10-21 02:35:00,3990,Great stuff.  I grew up just down the road from there and only discovered the awesome pike fishing in there a year or two before i left.  Tons of toothy critters in there early spring but never landed any monsters like that last one.  What a beast!
814095,chris.brock,2013-10-21 02:36:00,4053,"awesome, I'd rather catch those toothy critters than bass or Lake O salmon"

814123,Rod Caster,2013-10-21 11:57:00,5784,Good numbers and those ain't small fish either!
814125,ehg,2013-10-21 13:22:00,2666,"Nicely done! That last pike must be around 40 inches or so.  Funny how maybe some of best pike fishing in Ontario is around Lake Ontario in GTA.  Back about 15-20 yrs. ago entered Canadian Sportfishing magazine contest. Won  Pike Angler of year, for all of Canada,  couple of years just by entering bunch of 40 inch pike caught around Toronto harbourfront. lol   Great fish! Thanks for posting."
814148,Jigger,2013-10-21 16:37:00,1237,Great looking pike moxie! Nothing better than your kids asking to go fishing!
814178,aplumma,2013-10-21 19:57:00,6896,I so love fish with teeth when I go fishing that's what I want to catch. Very nice fish for sure    Art
