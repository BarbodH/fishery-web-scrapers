Well today, some of them were ready and some egg collecting took place. The staff there are very accomodating and didn't mind at all that I took a video. The fish are netted from the holding tanks and then put in an anesthetic solution that immidiately calms them. They think that the Brook Trout might be ready next week. I'm hoping that I can see some of that. Here's what I got today. "
