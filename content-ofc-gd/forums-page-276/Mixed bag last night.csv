Last night was one of the most mixed bags of fish as well as techniques I've had in a while... But it was the various techniques that got me some sweet fish...  I started off throwing a chunky Swimbait... I connected with a feisty 23 inch eye within a few minutes.... About 10 minutes after that I somehow managed to snag a 45"" musky in the tail.... After a long battle she was ok after a quick water release.... Just lucky the water was cool...  Then I tried trolling through the area I got the walleye casting... Bang... I got smoked... It didn't feel big be it was taking runs and peeling line... I had no idea what it was... The I saw it... Baaaaaaaa... Sheepshead....  I'm outta here...lol  Them I went searching for new fish/spots.... I went to a spot we have got few walleye in the past but we hadn't ""figured"" the spot out yet... The sonar lit up... I dropped down a shiny offering jigging vertical and on the 3rd or 4th lift I got smoked... And it was heavy... I thought right away that I might have found another sturgeon holding area and accidentally got one of them... Nope... Get the fish to the surface.... 27"" walleye.... Awesome!!!  Quick release... Drop my line again.... Couple more jigs and bang.... Another heavy fish.... Unfortunately this time is was a sturgeon..... After a 30-45 minute epic battle on 6lb fire line on a 6'3"" med light spinning rod.... A huge beast came to the surface.... This dinosaur measured in at 57"" without a tail pinch... Longest fish I've ever boated...  After that I picked up a buddy and did the night troll... Found a new spot... And finished the day with 9 walleye.... 1 giant sturgeon... 1 sheepshead... 1 musky... 1 smally...  Also saw the St.Lawrence River Institute out electro shocking for fish... Eels I think... Great to see $$$ being spent in our area...  Fun and interesting day...  Sorry I don't have pics..."
813496,chris.brock,2013-10-18 14:10:00,4053,"sounds like an exciting day, too bad you didn't take pictures, a quick picture of the sturgeon would have been interesting"
813498,mike rousseau,2013-10-18 14:12:00,4661,Not for this site Chris....
813500,Muskieman,2013-10-18 14:31:00,2472,^^^ LOL ! Sounds like fun !
813505,Roy,2013-10-18 15:20:00,13728,Not for this site Chris....   ???
813508,Musky or Specks,2013-10-18 15:27:00,2710,No pics argggggg
813509,fishindevil,2013-10-18 15:31:00,6254,right on mike !!!! well done....thats a great catch for a night out...
813512,mike rousseau,2013-10-18 15:37:00,4661," I know they're protected and closed year round... But when they end up being my biggest catch of my life I'll take a pic every time... I've caught a fair amount now and only take pics if it's a new PB...  Here you go...  No slamming please.... The fish was only outta water for a few seconds.... And it was an accidental catch... I got a 27"" walleye just a minute earlier in the exact same spot....  Mods if this turns into a bashing just shut her down ok...  That's a 60"" tape for reference....  "
813514,lew,2013-10-18 15:48:00,12766,"Congrats on that beast Mike, really incredible catch !!"
813530,2 tone z71,2013-10-18 17:47:00,1311,"Thats wicked !! thanks for sharing ,,bet that Muskie by the tail was a ride"
813532,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-18 17:50:00,0,these hardy fish survived a scalpel at my hands (inserting tags)... i have no doubt this fish survived just fine!
813535,Headhunter,2013-10-18 18:05:00,5703,"Alright, I'll be the one to take a shot! I would have preferred a closer up photo instead of the full length shot! LOL Sounds like a great night out to me! Congrats! HH"
813536,FISHEYEZ,2013-10-18 18:18:00,49,Sounds like you had an awesome night on the water
813537,aplumma,2013-10-18 18:20:00,6896,well done and a nice trip. Thanks for posting another one of your awesome reports.   Art
813552,Cosmos,2013-10-18 19:46:00,588,Thank you for your report Mike. It's a fish of lifetime.
813554,davey buoy,2013-10-18 19:51:00,5505,"Mike that fish is sweet,Never understood why people bash,if the fish is released.Good for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
813575,Locnar,2013-10-18 21:56:00,645,"Sounds like some epic fishing man! That Sturgeon is awesome, must have made the trip interesting eh."
813576,Fisherpete,2013-10-18 22:01:00,1814,Gotta love the variety of fish that you can catch on the Larry eh! Great trip and PB Mike. Sturgeon are awesome creatures.  Pete
813662,Rod Caster,2013-10-19 12:26:00,5784,"Yikes! What a day. Love seeing Sturgeon, and ya, they are pretty hardy fish from what I understand."
813746,esoxansteel,2013-10-19 16:12:00,1307,"Nice Sturg Mike, and a great multi-specie trip, nice to see some pre-historic history still navigating our waterways."
813882,Ron,2013-10-20 09:34:00,1683,"Nice pig of a sturgeon! i am surprised on how dark it is, I always assumed they were more of a silver/grey color. I have never caught, let alone see a live one in person. The mooskies starting to put the feed bags on now too?"
813887,Terry,2013-10-20 10:26:00,14456,I would love to get down there with my underwater cameras and get shots of those big ones swimming around
813890,buick14,2013-10-20 11:32:00,741,"Absolutely awesome! Never had the opportunity to be like ""awww man think its just another sturgeon""... Looking good."
813970,mike rousseau,2013-10-20 17:16:00,4661,I know a couple spots chuck full of emTerry...  My underwater camera doesn't record.... It's a cheapy black and white...  We could get some great footage in this clear water...
