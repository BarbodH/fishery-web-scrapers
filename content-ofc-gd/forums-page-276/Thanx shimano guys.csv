Thanx Shimano for great service above and beyond the ordinary"

813305,Headhunter,2013-10-17 12:50:00,5703,"Glad you got that all worked out! Sorry, but your story made me LOL... Reminds me of my brother who likes to chase the toothy critters. He likes to sit on the top of the back of his boat seat as his seat is pretty low and he can see easier from up there. Well, that's all fine and dandy, if you remember that you keep dumping your musky lure on the seat after changing up. So one fine summer day, he is fishing the Moon basin with his family in the boat. Notice a thunder storm making it's way across the bay and decide to boot it back to camp before it hits. So he is sitting on top of the back of the seat again, travelling along at 30 mph, when they hit another boat's wake. He slips off the back of the seat, right down onto a cluster on 10 to 12 inch baits! Yes, he now has a 12 inch musky lure attached to his rear end! He had to lay down across the back seat of his truck while my Sister in law drove him to the clinic. I think the folks at the clinic in Mactier are probabaly still laughing about that. I'm pretty sure he has started putting lures away after that encounter! HH"
