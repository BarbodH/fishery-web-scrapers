812899,Whopper,2013-10-15 02:56:00,2174,Exactly what I was thinking
813880,Ron,2013-10-20 09:08:00,1683,"Thanks for the replies and comments everyone. I am at the stage of my life where the kids have all ""growed"" up now. No grand kids, only our youngest daughter's lizard to take care of. Some how she forgot to pack that up when she moved out. My wife is and always has been a ""home body"", she would much rather do her quilting and read her murder mystery books than to go somewhere. So this leaves time for me to get out as often as I can. There's a neighborhood joke going around, something like ""It's awe full nice of you to move the boat so your wife can cut the grass under it"".   A change in my business has taken away some fishing opportunities, but in the same token, has encouraged me to take more than just 2 weeks holidays a year.  I'm glad I did!"
813886,wormdunker,2013-10-20 10:26:00,1711,Awesome pix!  Thanx for showing off! LOL I agree - mighty fine of you to move the boat so wifey can cut the grass.  She must be busy cutting grass 7 days a week??
813909,Ralph Field,2013-10-20 12:50:00,1018,You need to rethink your definition of ugly.
813912,Jds63,2013-10-20 13:31:00,1365,"A lot of trophys for sure , congrats on a great year so far !"
814197,Handlebarz,2013-10-21 22:17:00,3790,Dang you have had a killer year. Oh wait I have to see them picks each time your over just tempting me to give up musky fishing for some of the colourful fishies.
