I worked nights the night before so had to sleep in a little, then later met him up the road at the lake, and jumped in his boat.  sunrise    what a great outfit to fish out of, super comfy, lots of top end for hitting different spots    now for some fish pics, Fishindevil put on a clinic out there!,    spinnerbaits were a steady producer (even without a blade!)    Fishindevil with a nice fall bass    I even got in on the action too    sunset    back at the cottage, just in time for a rib dinner, perfect!    I went looking for a different species the next evening    thanks Fishindevil, a great day, great weather (sunburn in October!), hopefully we can hook up again"
