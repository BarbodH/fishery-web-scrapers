Initially charged for assualting a PO, when the tape surfaced, things were reversed.  He's going to visit Bubba for a year,  justice served."
813409,NAW,2013-10-17 23:27:00,4022,Good news.!
813411,davey buoy,2013-10-17 23:32:00,5505,And the Barrie chief said she's going after complete dismissal from the force. Have to love video in this case.
813415,Terry,2013-10-17 23:46:00,14456,"maybe it will make a few more ""tough guy"" cops take it down a notch or two"
813427,Rod Caster,2013-10-18 00:36:00,5784,excellent. That was a horrible video to watch
813431,Cast-Away,2013-10-18 00:47:00,790,How does a guy like that get through the screening process in the first place? He was just a bully and a sadist.
813435,Rod Caster,2013-10-18 00:57:00,5784,"There is an officer in Sudbury who has a bucket full of convicted and outstanding charges who has been on payroll since 2011 and not working!. ...I wonder if the bully in the video got paid for being a d### as well. Police budgets are approx. 95 percent payroll....brutal waste of money, or at least they should have to pay it back if convicted.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/prosecutor-calls-sudbury-police-officer-deceitful-1.1703453"

813462,bigugli,2013-10-18 11:00:00,6138,One year for a crime that can carry a 5 year sentence? That is called preferential sentencing.
813477,2 tone z71,2013-10-18 13:03:00,1311,  Don't count on it. lets hope
813484,fishing n autograph,2013-10-18 13:25:00,2540, In the last 8 years I have seen very few people go to jail for assault. It was the breach of trust that landed him in jail
813486,2 tone z71,2013-10-18 13:37:00,1311,all union crap....there's thugs on the street and some of them carry badges too...he will do 2 months safe and sound in PC with pay
813488,fishing n autograph,2013-10-18 13:42:00,2540,No he's already fired
813490,2 tone z71,2013-10-18 13:50:00,1311,excellent
813502,DanD,2013-10-18 14:35:00,2223,It was the breach of trust that landed him in jail  And that's is the sad part; we teach our kids to trust the police and then a bone head like this guy breaks that trust we all should have for/in them.  I service a number of OPP cruisers and I've got to know quite a few of the officers; most a great people but there's a few that make you wonder why they've  been able to keep their jobs; let alone allowed to carry a gun.  Dan.

813522,fishing n autograph,2013-10-18 16:53:00,2540,News to me that assaulting a person equates to espionage but that's just my understanding of the criminal code
813565,Spiel,2013-10-18 20:36:00,9065,Fodder or another forum perhaps.... *big yawn*
