Personally I have never had an issue crossing the boarder in either direction. And this includes crossing this past weekend after going to the Bills game."

813724,fishing,2013-10-19 15:36:00,167,More than 95% of officers are fine. Should interview a PR lady than an OFFICER. They are not trained for that.

813747,Canuck2fan,2013-10-19 16:20:00,1444,Holy crap that clown needs to be fired and quickly... He obviously has some major power trip issues.
813796,HTHM,2013-10-19 19:59:00,4082,This is That is a satirical CBC radio show known for its ability to fool some of the people most of the time. So yes this is not an actual border guard but rather an actor portraying one in a satirical manner. Feel free to unknot your panties.
813799,davey buoy,2013-10-19 20:47:00,5505,"That was pretty funny,I just had to share it lol."
813801,Joeytier,2013-10-19 21:01:00,3990,Hahaha!  This is That strikes again
813803,Canuck2fan,2013-10-19 21:16:00,1444,Yep I was had.... Although I had a very similar experience in real life with a border guard coming back across. The voice sounded just like him I assumed he had got promoted LOL. I did learn one thing that night though DO NOT ever go across for just 2hrs with a buddy who is Jamaican and won't speak English when being questioned but insists on driving and a Japanese national who can't resist being sarcastic when confronted with authority...
813806,i2cool2fool,2013-10-19 21:23:00,349,^^ sounds like a trip to remember.
