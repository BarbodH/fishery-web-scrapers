813253,Locnar,2013-10-17 01:03:00,645,"I've been out a couple times in the last couple weeks, and I find every year around this time... at least my usual spots... that shore fishing this time of year yields very little success. At one river location, I usually catch largies... I'm guessing most of them have journeyed out to the lake for the winter? I usually fish rivers if I'm stuck on shore, is there anything I should look for in order to find success? Changes in lures? Or do I need to have a boat and head out on a lake?"
813258,ChasinTails,2013-10-17 01:17:00,90,"float the pools, swing the pools, dead drift pools, flick spinners in the pools so on and so on"
813261,Locnar,2013-10-17 01:33:00,645,"Thanks Chasintails, is that mainly for trout and salmon for the areas with extended seasons... or would that those techniques work for smallies in the rivers?"
813264,Canuck2fan,2013-10-17 01:42:00,1444,Just after Bass opens I like to float worms or leeches for bass.... Tons of fun. I know the bass were chasing minnows in the river on Monday. Too bad I was after chrome or I would have floated a minnows for bass.
813357,ChasinTails,2013-10-17 18:59:00,90,"Thanks Chasintails, is that mainly for trout and salmon for the areas with extended seasons... or would that those techniques work for smallies in the rivers? works for anything as long as u have the right bait/lure/fly"
813375,Rich,2013-10-17 20:53:00,3927,"Stick to shallower waterbodies. The fish, no matter how inactive, will be forced to seek out shore refuge due to a lack of safe 'deep zones' to winter in.  Its the only way ive been able to keep catching warm water species the last two months."
813377,esoxansteel,2013-10-17 21:02:00,1307,"Dams also block upstream migration, and concentrate fish in the deeper pools usually found below, this is for inland bodies of water only, you cannot not directly fish below dams/barriers on tributary creeks flowing into the great lakes."
813378,Old Ironmaker,2013-10-17 21:20:00,8243,"When I was able to bushwhack into streams and rivers in the  fall was always the best time for Smallmouth for us. Normally we couldn't get to them in the summer as they were deep in the lakes when we didn't have access to a boat. Fall was best for us.  The Maitland river was a honey hole for smallies. I'm not sure about now. Leech like plastics and Mr. Twisters on jigs, shinner imitation minnow baits fished slowly brought nice catches of bass. Find a bend in the river and fish the undercut of the bend, slowly. Drifting a black twister rigged below a quality float was a winner as well. And rigged California style as well, which is simply a hook, rubber and a few splitshot above the hook enough to bounce bottom.  Burleigh Falls from the rocks held Bass and Walleye.  Port Maitland pier is also hot this time of year before and after dusk for nice Walleye on Reef Runners and deep diving Rappala's. Bounce the bottom which is about 12' to 15'. Be careful of climbing around the rocks, bring a long handled net."
813419,Locnar,2013-10-18 00:04:00,645,"Thanks for the responses guys, I'm gonna give the smallie river a go this weekend and see how she goes. Maybe I'll bring along some minnows for good luck."
813422,ehg,2013-10-18 00:21:00,2666,"My guess is your in the Oshawa/Whitby area. If so i did a lot of trib. fishing there in 80's and 90's.  Go to the mouths of local rivers (especially Oshawa Creek even Whitby marina.). The steelhead kinda disappear until March, but Browns and big Walleye start hanging around the river mouth.  Try minnowbaits, long casts worked slowly. Switcch up to fresh roe/float or spinners for something different. From now until ice up fishing is slow but.caught biggest fish by surprise, long fish less hours turned out to be worthwhile."
813424,Locnar,2013-10-18 00:28:00,645,"Yes I am in the Whitby area, I was thinking of driving up to a river in the Kawarthas that I've had success at. I've never had any success fishing the piers or creek mouths in this area though. I did catch one small bullhead though... but nothing else. Did you ever fish the Whitby harbour?"
813428,Sinker,2013-10-18 00:37:00,8692,"Crappies and eyes should be at any of the locks on the trent now at night.  Even off shore in the lakes, the eyes will be in shallow water at night.  The last hour of daylight, into the dark is the best time, but we catch eyes all night long. A simple ""pickeral rig"" with minnows almost never fails. Clip a bell on your rod, and enjoy yourself.  At night, the shallows are warmer, and full of minnows. The eyes come in chasing bait. Suspending stick baits, with a slow pull, pause retrieve works good too if there's not too many weeds.  Good luck! The fall can be some of the best shore fishing of the year!  S."
813430,ehg,2013-10-18 00:45:00,2666,"Did you ever fish the Whitby harbour? Ya, but you have to put in the time. The Oshawa Creek right at mouth was by far best. Not the pier now. Like i said Roe/float, minnowbaits, spinners and lots of patience Right at river mouth 5- 10 ft. depth there."
813433,Locnar,2013-10-18 00:55:00,645,"When it comes to the Oshawa creek mouth... is that the part where it meets the harbour? I tried the harbour once earlier this year, it was pretty grimy looking and didn't seem like anything there. And sinker, I'm guessing below the locks?"
813440,Old Ironmaker,2013-10-18 01:27:00,8243,"If your close to the Kawarthas and you are, get your butt to Burleigh Falls and fish off the rocks right of the Falls off the rocks with minnows or spinners or, or, or. You will not regret it this time of year. Walleye, pike and Smallmouth. This time of the year big bait, big fish."
813441,Sinker,2013-10-18 01:36:00,8692,"Yes, below the locks. You'll see other people fishing there.  S."
813478,mike rousseau,2013-10-18 13:03:00,4661,Any specific species you want to target?
813569,Locnar,2013-10-18 21:15:00,645,"Mike, anything really... Smallies, largies, pike, walleye... Not looking to keep anything, unless some tank crappies/perch decide to join the fun."
813571,misfish,2013-10-18 21:26:00,29133,Hit the break wall at Heritage park here in Barrie. All the perch you want. Get here early. Hit the Bait Bucket for some minnows ... Opens at 5am.  Great guy  http://www.thebaitbucket.ca/  Have a blast.
813850,ChasinTails,2013-10-20 00:42:00,90,any one fish fenelon falls ?
813921,Locnar,2013-10-20 14:29:00,645,"No sir, I fish Bobcaygeon quite often though."
813922,Rich,2013-10-20 14:37:00,3927,"Fenelon falls kinda sucks. Grandpas cottage is near there. All i ever got is tiny smallies, big gills and cigar walleyes."
813955,ChasinTails,2013-10-20 15:34:00,90,"Fenelon falls kinda sucks. Grandpas cottage is near there. All i ever got is tiny smallies, big gills and cigar walleyes. i fish literraly at the base of the falls, losta 2lb smallies and massive panfish its fun if youre there already but not to specifically go to for fishing, i always see massive carp at the locks but i cant fish there"
