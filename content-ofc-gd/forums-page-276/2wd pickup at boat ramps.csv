Can't say for sure how many times it has saved my butt but can tell you of all the times I wish I had it when I was driving a 2wd truck.  When I went from a 4.3L S10 to a 5L 1500 the gas was only an extra $10 per week, a small insurance price for some piece of mind.  I used to put patio slabs in the back of the S10 and bags of sand, ran winter tires and it all helped but not even close to what having a 4x4 will do for you.  Get the 4x4 and you won't have anything to worry about.  X2  After owning a few two wheel drive trucks years ago, and then driving more than my share of 4x4's I would NEVER go back to a 2WD.Even in everyday winter driving it's handy. No spinning from a stop or struggling up inclines.If you do a lot of boat launching I'd highly recommend a 4x4. X2   Maybe if you're talking about the big 2500 series trucks with the diesels, but a 1500 4x4 doesn't require any more maintenance then a 2wd model...  I'd agree with that, never had much more to do then gas, oil tires and brakes about every 45-50K.  Last set of brakes lasted 60K on the F150."

I did own a nissan that I could drive in sand dunes and it was quite capable.  All wheels provided traction.  Not 2 corners, with limited slip engaging the other side once in a while  which is the norm with most NA vehicles.  Not much of a box though and horrible gas mileage...  That being said if your going to purchase a truck to deal with toys it may as well be full size with 4 wheel drive.  I also agree with others who said if it has unibody then it isn't a real truck!"

Mileage alone is not a good determining factor for break wear.  Obviously, stop and go city traffic is going to wear your breaks faster than the equivalent mileage on the highway.  Towing or driving with a heavy load will wear the brakes faster.  Driving off road and getting your breaks dirty can cause them to wear quicker.  An aggressive driver will go through breaks faster...

813317,Raf,2013-10-17 14:29:00,3495,honda doesnt make a truck  fwd <> truck
813318,Richie Razor,2013-10-17 14:39:00,536,"Sure they do - ridgeline. It's not a full size, but it's an extremely capable and reliable light pick-up that'll tow about 5k lbs, plus it has 4wd."
813319,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-17 14:57:00,10439,"Actually it's technically all wheel drive, but yes they are much more capable than a 2wd pickup. Just ask the guy in Alaska with the 4wd suburban who got stuck on the beach and me with my widdle Honda got his arse unstuck and pulled out. It pulls my boat, camper and snowmobile trailers just fine too.  "
813322,glen,2013-10-17 15:19:00,2641,I have used a minivan and a 2wd ext cab truck.  Capability is about the same.
813324,chris.brock,2013-10-17 15:27:00,4053,"I think Raf was implying the Ridgeline isn't a ""real truck""  it's funny, once you get out of the city, nobody buys Ridgelines or Avalanches"
813333,DanD,2013-10-17 16:08:00,2223,You can't compare a ridgeline to an Avalanche; but I am thinking of swapping out the spare tire in my Avalanche for one of them there Honda's. It would look cute riding in the box of a real SUV.  Dan.
813334,ch312,2013-10-17 16:13:00,1590,"I think Raf was implying the Ridgeline isn't a ""real truck""  it's funny, once you get out of the city, nobody buys Ridgelines or Avalanches  Yep. Unibody = wannabe truck    Apparently Ford is switching to unibody in 2015 and I imagine those who use trucks for work/offroading will sway away from Ford for that reason.   After owning a 2wd truck for a few years and now having a 4wd truck for a couple years, I will never own a 2wd vehicle ever again and can't understand why anyone in Ontario would even consider a 2wd truck over a 4x4. Adding weight to the back does increase traction, but it will never compare to a 4x4.  Life is just so much easier when you can turn a knob and have power to 4 tires..."
813339,tb4me,2013-10-17 17:16:00,3295,I drive a 4x4 dodge ram 1500 I tow a 18.5 smokercraft. Only once have I had to use the 4x4 to get my boat out of the water..That was when the water was low and I had to almost put the truck in the water to get the boat on the trailer. So ya 2wd you will be ok 95% of the time its that 5 % that would scare me..lol
813341,tb4me,2013-10-17 17:19:00,3295,"Not my truck, time to switch to Toyota or Honda. Honda...lol that's funny  Toyota is a good truck but the cost is int even comparable to ford dodge or chev.."
813196,tomkat,2013-10-16 22:01:00,246,Thinking of replacing the minivan with a pickup and was wondering about traction at boat ramps.I have never had a problem with the minivan but it is front drive.I would rather avoid 4wd for cost mileage etc. My package is 2500 lb but when I upgrade the boat likely about 3500 lb. Any thoughts?
813201,dave524,2013-10-16 22:16:00,4508,"Never towed with a front wheel drive  but casual observation has told me they are about the worst vehicles for traction at a launch ramp. I have towed with a 2 wheel drive pickup and had no problem. Get limited slip/ posi type rearend , it helps."
813203,Fisherman,2013-10-16 22:18:00,7201,"Dry concrete ramps don't pose much of a problem,  if they're wet or loaded with algae or slime, it can be tricky, frozen ramps can be hair raising.  Gravel/dirt ramps depending on how hard they're packed can be a real hit and miss.  If you're set on a 2wd, make sure it has a limited slip or locking rear end.  Then invest in a couple of traction pads and a stout recovery strap, usually someone will find it in their heart to pull you out so the next person can launch/retrieve."
813204,Joeytier,2013-10-16 22:24:00,3990,The miniscule gas savings youd get from buying 2wd would go to waste from having to mash the gas pedal to get out of any less than perfect boat ramp.  Buy a tow strap lol
813205,Jarfish,2013-10-16 22:25:00,20,"I've got a 2 wheel drive Colorado and I've never had any problem with it. I launch on concrete,wet concrete,gravel and all are fine. I pull a 17 and a half foot starcraft bowrider."
813207,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-16 22:28:00,10439,I launch on loose gravel a lot and you would likely get stuck in 2wd. Ice is another issue if you run late in the year.
813208,lew,2013-10-16 22:32:00,12766,Get the 4x4 and you won't have anything to worry about.
813209,davey buoy,2013-10-16 22:39:00,5505,"I agree Lew,I couldn't imagine going back to a two wheel drive with some of the launches I frequent.Some ,no way you could use a 2 wheel drive.For example,try sturgeon point marina with a 2wd and a descent size boat .WOW lol.Saw one fellow pulled right into the river from the launch."
813210,BillM,2013-10-16 22:41:00,17367,I can't understand why people buy 2wd trucks to be honest.
813211,Bernie,2013-10-16 22:46:00,3190,"After owning a few two wheel drive trucks years ago, and then driving more than my share of 4x4's I would NEVER go back to a 2WD.Even in everyday winter driving it's handy. No spinning from a stop or struggling up inclines.If you do a lot of boat launching I'd highly recommend a 4x4."
813212,Richie Razor,2013-10-16 22:47:00,536,"True. I mean what's the difference in cost, 1-2k tops when buying new? And fuel savings is absolutely a non issue since some newer SUVs and pick-ups can run on 2 front wheels when city driving and the 4x4 kicks in when needed, all electronically.  Simply put, if you are going to tow a boat or a trailer (or whatever) buy a reliable vechicle with 4x4 capabilities.... That is unless your boat is an inflatable (rubber to some) dingy."
813213,OhioFisherman,2013-10-16 22:47:00,6623,"Most of the guys I know pull with a 2 wheel drive F 150 or a Chevy pickup two wheel drive, but ramps here tend to be civilized."

813216,Raf,2013-10-16 22:49:00,3495,"95% of the time you'll be fine in a 2wd, it's the 5% that's worth the 4wd.  in my old jeep cherokee i rarely had to put it in 4wd to pull out a 2500+lb lund but when i had to, I sure was glad i had it."
813218,Raf,2013-10-16 22:52:00,3495,"True. I mean what's the difference in cost, 1-2k tops when buying new? And fuel savings is absolutely a non issue since some newer SUVs and pick-ups can run on 2 front wheels when city driving and the 4x4 kicks in when needed, all electronically.   even in 2wd mode you're still lugging a significant amount of weight for the 4wd system.  however, i can't see the mileage difference between an otherwise same truck being more than 1-2 mpg between a 2wd and 4wd model"
813219,davey buoy,2013-10-16 22:52:00,5505,"95% of the time you'll be fine in a 2wd, it's the 5% that's worth the 4wd.  in my old jeep cherokee i rarely had to put it in 4wd to pull out a 2500+lb lund but when i had to, I sure was glad i had it. I hear you Raff with my 3000lb plus boat .With a lot of the lakes lower water I'm finding I'm backing in where my back bumper is submerged,and the bottom very muddy and sandy to say the least."
813220,ChasinTails,2013-10-16 22:53:00,90,"go with a 4x4 like most said its better, more traction and power"
813222,tomkat,2013-10-16 23:04:00,246,Pulling my lund explorer all over the place for the 9 years I have owned it with of all things a minivan never once had an issue at a ramp 200000 k on it . I just want to know if the truck would offer better or worse boat ramp traction than the van?
813225,Henricus,2013-10-16 23:07:00,118,4x4 is like insurance.  Seems like a waste of money until you need it.  The first experience of getting stuck on a ramp in your 2wd will haunt you until the arrival of your 4x4.
813226,i2cool2fool,2013-10-16 23:12:00,349, I am on my 2nd 4x4 now. The first I bought used then I ended up buying new later. I can't ever imagine going back to 2wd - not willingly!
813227,ChasinTails,2013-10-16 23:15:00,90,"if you can, get a 4x4 suv, they have better mileage and unless your a contractor or something u dont really need a truck just my 0.2 cents"
813228,irishfield,2013-10-16 23:17:00,26272,98% of the time I pull my 2150 Baron out in 2 wheel drive. It's that 2% of the time that I don't... that makes the difference between it all going in the lake and pulling the boat out!
813231,tomkat,2013-10-16 23:24:00,246,Alright I give up even the wife says get 4x4 I was just gonna go bare bones f150 base to keep the price down but will probably keep it 10 yrs anyway so maybe I should splurge a bit. Thanks for the input
813232,aplumma,2013-10-16 23:25:00,6896,It gets fun when a 2WD is spinning the tires and the boat launch has enough angle to it to drag the truck backwards. I bought a 4X4 for the weather and towing of boats for down here in the South I imagine you can get more use and justify it easily up North  Don't forget to look at the Eco Boost you will not regret it.

813241,Raf,2013-10-16 23:51:00,3495,"Pulling my lund explorer all over the place for the 9 years I have owned it with of all things a minivan never once had an issue at a ramp 200000 k on it . I just want to know if the truck would offer better or worse boat ramp traction than the van?  if you never got stuck in your fwd van, you wont get stuck in a 2wd truck  it sounds like you use good launches and/or dont launch in november, december or march, april  i'd still get a 4wd though."
