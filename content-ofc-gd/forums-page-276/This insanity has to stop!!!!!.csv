And accordingly, media always hates the current government (whatever party it is) and feasts on presenting stories of scandal and crisis, because quite frankly, that's what sells newspapers and drives viewership. Go back through history and you will see clearly that no government has ever escaped this. The media has hated them all.  While I discount a lot of what I read in the papers, I do accept information from credible, unbiased sources like the auditor general. And given that this is the third time the auditor general has identified major problems with the Ontario Liberals' accounting (the other two being e-health and Ornge, at about $1 billion apiece), this government has clearly reached its expiry date and needs to go out in the compost toute-de-suite."

812638,Twocoda,2013-10-13 17:40:00,4130,I would think the move to save the industry is a self serving political move to generate and promote gambling to the masses so that eventually it will be another source of income to the party once it eventually does turn a profit ( which it will) people get additions easily in time of financial crisis when there is a false hope being slammed in their face on a daily basis...the people lose...government wins

812643,Canuck2fan,2013-10-13 17:59:00,1444,"I don't agree with the 400 million being given away or the 1.1 Billion that was wasted. What I do agree with though is that both the Liberal and Conservatives were GOING to close those plants to get elected in those ridings. It just so happens the Liberals ""won"" only to lose big time once the truth came out.  It is complete insanity that about 100 people with money who lived near the proposed plants had the ability to cause this financial fiasco. Another thing I don't understand is how come the people who got the buy out money aren't being put of our business, due to public outrage.  They should be boycotted into bankruptcy after gouging us the tax payer for something they didn't even have to deliver? Do those losers, not have a shred of dignity either? I guess when you wine and dine politicans to get those lucrative contracts it like lying down with dogs you get fleas too... Remember the next time you get upset about this, that money went to companies and people who didn't for what ever reason full fill what they promised, but they cashed the cheque anyhow. To me that is just as low as the politics of it. I could see them having there ""proven actual"" costs covered but anything more is just morally wrong.  As for the horsey deal, the real story isn't about the 400 million being given to horse racing.... The real story is the actuaries at OLG discovered that losing horse racing tracks and popularity will cause the ""CASINOS"" at the race tracks to lose money from other games. The 400 million is probably revenue neutral if you look at what the OLG makes off other games at the tracks. The press can't mention that though because people might realize they almost always lose more than they win if they keep gambling. The OLG contributes 1.7 to 2 Billion annually in profit to the government and some of those funds do go to food banks and other things mentioned.  The other small upside of horse racing surviving is it will tick P3TA off and that is always a good thing for outdoorsman. If they spend more time and money fighting the sport of kings it is less attention giving to stopping fishing."

With the PC's  led by Hudak wanting to give everyone temporary minimum wage part time jobs. The conservative druggie  Ford brothers etc,,,,,.....Maybe the NDP are the choice.  Just graduated from college  last time tNDP were in power and was offered a bunch of well paying unionized jobs. Mike Harris PC's  came to power and i lost good job due to lack of seniority in the sick union busting crap."

PC is just as bad on a larger scale..have you read a newspaper in the last year? ...If political threads tick you off...you still have the right not to click on them....for the time being anyways
