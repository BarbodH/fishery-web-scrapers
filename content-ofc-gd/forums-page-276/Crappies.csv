813933,BillM,2013-10-20 15:03:00,17367,I do the best in the fall to be honest.  Find those deep weed edges with green weeds and you'll find the fish.
813939,benzumi,2013-10-20 15:11:00,17,Thanks for the advice Bill. Going to try and get out to the Kawarthas next weekend. Will have post a report after that
813944,BillM,2013-10-20 15:19:00,17367,"I like your standard ice fishing jigs along with really small tube jigs.   Gotta keep an eye on your sonar as well, if you're 10ft off the spot you won't catch a damn thing, lol!"
813950,benzumi,2013-10-20 15:25:00,17,lol I know! I missed the spring fish for crappies this year because I was in Amsterdam for a wedding so hoping to get my fix this fall. Here's hoping the winds don't get too crazy and will be able to get out there.
813974,Fishnwire,2013-10-20 17:33:00,983,We sometimes get them off the dock at my buddy's marina on the French this time of year.  I'm hoping to try next weekend.  We pretty much employ standard ice tactics.
814024,aplumma,2013-10-20 20:23:00,6896,I use a slow troll with a jigs tipped with a mealworm. I try to get down 1/3 the water column so 12 feet water 4ft jig depth. Once I get a hit I drop a buoy and fish behind it 10ft or so . Today I used 50 mealworms and caught 75 fish it was a bright sunny day so don't let the sun keep you from fishing.   Art

814054,aplumma,2013-10-20 23:20:00,6896,Yes pond X has been very very good to me. I was just scouting and didn't stop to fish any of the pods I found which was about 30. Big fish was 15 inches most were 10-13 inches few were smaller than 9 inches. As a bonus I got a few platter sized bluegills and a few nice bass to mix it up.   Art
814061,benzumi,2013-10-20 23:58:00,17,"Tried a couple times at Chemong in the Fall at night last year. Nothing really hitting. Depending on the weather next week, if the winds are in our favour we'll try during the day and look for those deeper weed patches. Nothing like catching a giant slab on an ultra-light! have the i"
