813756,Ralph Field,2013-10-19 16:42:00,1018,110 is about half price which is good. I've never handled one or fished with anyone that used one. From a picture of the reel the handle placement is too close to the rim for my liking. Best of luck!
813760,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-19 16:57:00,0,i don't know anything about but the price seems good!  i have found that the brand of reel is much more forgivable than the rod.   i have many friends that happily use entry level brands like okuma and catch more fish than people using much more expensive equipment.  pair it with a quality rod and you'll be set.

813769,GbayGiant,2013-10-19 17:28:00,1780,I am sure one of the regular pin heads on this site will chime in and tell you what they think.  
813777,shimano19,2013-10-19 18:33:00,196,like others were saying the reel isn't the most important aspect of the setup. I was using a rapala r-type for a while and I had no problem landing kings and steelhead. you could always put new bearings in that reel if your not satisfied. yesterday I got a nice surprise for my birthday...a islander steelheader. cant wait to use it!
813779,porkpie,2013-10-19 18:35:00,2521,"If I had to spend my money on an entry level centerpin, I would probably go with the new rapalas.  My first choice would be the classic drifter that runs about $150-160 at lebarons, my second choice would be the rapala R type, that I think retails around $110 or $120.  I own multiple float reels, and have fished many more, and the classic drifter would be my first choice based on design, startup and overall smoothness, and the price sure isn't bad!"
813805,lurechucker,2013-10-19 21:22:00,28,i dont think you can lose much sleep for that price

813897,spinnerdoc,2013-10-20 12:11:00,556,"If I were you I would get a float reel that feels good in your hands. Go to the stores and have a feel for the ones that they have within your budget. Nothing like seeing a product in person.  Amundson reels are more popular out west. They are a Canadian company  but  their manufacturing facility is in China. I have  a switch rod set up from them and I could not complain  of the quality. That bring said I cant comment on the reel since I have not handled it. The most important feature, for me at least, is the start up. If it's any consolation, it's hard to find float reels nowadays that has a bad start up. Start up and spin time are not one and the same. A reel that does not spin that long does not necessarily mean it has a bad start up.  Fit, finish,  weight its all subjective to what you can live with in your  budget."
813905,Ralph Field,2013-10-20 12:39:00,1018,The reels you saw on ebay are prone to have the line stuck behind the spool according to what owners say on other forums. They aren't much better than what you presently have. If you feel strongly about buying it then go for it.

Cheers and Tightlines"

You won't break the bank if it's not your cup of tea. The reel spins nicely and it's fairly light but the one flaw I found is the clicker placement on the back plate.  Constantly engaging while holding the reel.  They have one model higher that is better."
