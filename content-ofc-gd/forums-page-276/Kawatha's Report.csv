813097,Propwash,2013-10-16 14:18:00,19,Beauty Tiger and good fishing.  Sound like you boys had a great time.
813103,Sinker,2013-10-16 14:24:00,8692,"Beauty tiger!! I've never caught one! I'll assume that came out of Balsam, and not sturg?? You guys did awesome, thats a pile of musky!  S."
813104,Renegade67,2013-10-16 14:29:00,86,That tiger is just stunning!  Awsome job!
813105,TJQ,2013-10-16 14:35:00,7806,Yup... That tiger has stripes!!!
813126,BillM,2013-10-16 16:16:00,17367,"16 for 53 sounds like a steelhead report!  Good job, that's a lot of toothy critters."
813233,Hank Jr,2013-10-16 23:29:00,146,"Thanks guys. My son caught 2 Tigers on Balsam the other was mark nice to but was only 37"" we also had a follow from a smaller one . It was a fun week and the time really went quick ."
813235,Ron,2013-10-16 23:39:00,1683,"Sounds like you guys had an awesome trip. It makes me wonder why I always leave this area to go on a week long fishing trip. That is one spectacular looking Tiger, still haven't been able to put a notch on the belt buckle for myself."
813259,wormdunker,2013-10-17 01:18:00,1711,That Tiger Musky is awesome!  Thanx for posting.
813315,kitch,2013-10-17 14:26:00,42,"Nice looking fish there Hank!  Looks from the pictures like you had good weather too.  I wouldn't mind catching either of those big girls, I've been stuck in a sub 40"" rut for a bit now."
813329,JoshS,2013-10-17 15:33:00,729,That Tiger is a beauty!!!

813826,mistaredone,2013-10-19 22:44:00,913,16 for 53 isn't your typical Muskie fishing stat. Sounds like an exciting trip. Amazing pic of that tiger. I'm jealous
813869,Rizzo,2013-10-20 03:06:00,4754,"some gorgeous fish and a great trip I'm sure. Maybe you mean 16 for 23 though? If not, may I suggest hooks on your lures"
813901,benzumi,2013-10-20 12:23:00,17,Amazing catches. Thinking of hitting Sturgeon next weekend. Last time we went in the summer it was crazy windy.
813911,NAW,2013-10-20 13:31:00,4022,Amazing tiger for sure!!  Nice report man!
813916,Joey,2013-10-20 14:01:00,9122,Great job     Love that tiger!!
