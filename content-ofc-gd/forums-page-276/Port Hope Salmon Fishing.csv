Would there be salmons if we go by end of this week? Looking to have a great time. Also, we have a conservation license, we can catch two right and keep it?"
812932,FloatnFly,2013-10-15 15:09:00,1640,"check the regs, ganny open from the cn tracks to the lake only, you have about 200 yrds of river to fish, good luck"
812933,BillM,2013-10-15 15:22:00,17367,I like salmons!

812950,chessy,2013-10-15 16:46:00,610,river is actually open from the cp tracks to the lake witch gives you a extra 75 yards... till the end of the year then closes to the cn tracks south
812951,Paulus,2013-10-15 16:59:00,522,"Salmon are fun, for sure. If you go,  please don't litter! Bring a bag for your garbage and take it home, or place it in one of the many public trash cans available."

No need to pay for parking, the fine folks at Port Hope, have free parking, but the 50 cent drafts at the Walton Hotel are a long gone thing of the past. Was a great place to go if the Salmons arnt biting"
812956,ChasinTails,2013-10-15 19:11:00,90,"anywhere is good when the fish are coming in, everywhere is also bad if there not there"
812960,porkpie,2013-10-15 19:17:00,2521,"May be a few late runners if the expected rain comes through.  Majority of the salmon Re in the closed sections of the river.  As Chessy mentioned, you can only fish to the second train bridge north of the river mouth.  Lots of water to fish there, but your timing may be off.  Good luck!"

813107,Shimano,2013-10-16 14:42:00,2,Would you guys happen to have address of the location for parking or a pin point in the map where it is a good spot for salmon fishing? I know it's down there but I don't know if I should park on the west of the river or the east if there are parking spots.
813124,BillM,2013-10-16 16:08:00,17367,"Follow the crowds, you won't be the only one there I can guarantee you that."
813128,FloatnFly,2013-10-16 16:25:00,1640,google maps work.....

813198,Salmonidstalker,2013-10-16 22:09:00,265,"I want to catch a salmons, legal."
813215,Richie Razor,2013-10-16 22:48:00,536,"Don't even bother, the run is over. You'll go there and encounter nothing but stink."
