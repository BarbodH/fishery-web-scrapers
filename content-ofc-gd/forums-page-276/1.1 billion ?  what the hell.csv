813646,jbailey,2013-10-19 06:31:00,866,Antonio Nicaso could explain alot of the canadian politics for those toronto sun readers.
812880,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-15 01:00:00,4399,Green party eh...well if the sun didn't rise one day and they were to get elected you could probably kiss our natural resources sector good bye and in all likelihood what remains of our manufacturing sector. On a positive note they would legalize marijuana and while I am not a user I would support this for the many people that it would benefit medically. On the down side if elected and May was unable to lead the government her deputy is none other than Georges Laraque.....not sure if he is PM material but he could probably punch the crap out of the rest of the world leaders.  Yes indeed vote responsibly.!!!!!!!!!
812903,jbailey,2013-10-15 04:11:00,866,if only responsibility meant the same thing to everyone..

812957,jimmer,2013-10-15 19:12:00,2730,"I opened this thread thinking that there might be someone defending the fiberals. I am worried that they will get back in though, as TO always votes for them. (as someone said earlier, just because they always vote for them) Sadly, I have chosen not to place a vote in the next election; I agee with Cliff, no other party really offers a better altenative, just crooks in a different colour. Someone should be going to jail over the $1.1 waste. My bet is they will get a bonus and still receive their gold plated pensiion. If no one is held accountable; there is no stopping future politicians from doing the same. Amazing how there are no laws for behaviour at a political level."

812991,Cookslav,2013-10-15 22:40:00,1457," Thats the problem bud, There hasn't been an example to show anyone.  We don't hold them accountable...instead we vote them in again and give them a second round. If we kicked them out each and every time, at some point someone might just get the message. Although I'll be the first to admit it thats dulling the issue down to a very boad scope.  So many variables to play into... I just wish more people really looked into why they are casting their vote. GTA is Staunch Liberal country, but very few will actually say why...they just vote red, again, and again.  I simply hope people look into the platforms next time around and hold them accountable.... Vote for Harry Potter for all I care, just don't let the Liberals have another turn. Its all I'm say'n..."
813049,jbailey,2013-10-16 04:40:00,866,"understanding politics is a lot more than reading a platform or understanding a stance on some sort of issue. Look at the US, supposed to be the american dream but that is not the reality. You can argue about all of this or really concern yourself with whats attainable and what is not. As a citizen we can guilt you into voting and say that is the problem, but realistically that is not the issue. Everyone wants to pretend like they know better. Conservative, Liberals and NDP are all pawns. If you think McGuinty is responsible for everything thats going on than you are very niave. Look into the condo boom of Toronto and why the crime rate is so low of a 2.5million population. The stretch of money goes far beyond the politics that the average individual believes."
813358,shane,2013-10-17 19:05:00,652,The only time any party is telling the truth is when they are calling the other party a bunch of liars.  They are only looking out for #1. And you ain't even #2.
813381,Cookslav,2013-10-17 21:34:00,1457," As the once elected leader he most certainly is responsible for a lot of things gone wrong....granted not single handedly. He's just the face of the party, and of course there are many many other variables. But you can't say he does not hold a senior level of responsibilty when it comes to the parties track record and more specifically Ontario's Hydro ""issues""  I wouldn't say casting an educated vote is the only way to change things, or even fix 50% of the issues we have these days, but I certainly would say that it is more proactive, and 100% more effective in aiding our situation then blind voting or not casting one at all.  Outside of learning and understanding politics and casting an informed vote though there is very little one can do outside of actually doing somthing about it like running in an election, or taking up a political career of sorts.

The issue is about 60% of the people who vote do not actually research the platforms and understand the party positions they are supporting. Many times people just vote based on ""preferred"" parties whom they think reflect their way of thinking... I have friends who vote Liberal because they ALWAYS vote liberal...They feel the Liberals are more Left minded and therefore more in line with their personal though process, while my parents are members of the PC party....they ALWAYS vote PC for the same reasons. I personally try to keep in mind there is no ""perfect"" party to vote for but… There is always going to be that one party whom is the lesser of the evils.  But for cripes sake if we can’t support any one party and we know they are all liars there is one thing we CAN do…..Hold them accountable!!!! If they muck it up....Vote ‘em out and give the next jerk a shot. If we did this more often we’d see some accountability. Letting McSquinty slide last time sealed our fate….at this point I'd rather try ANYONE but the Liberals. They had their chance, again, and again...time to let ""someone"" else have a shot.  We can be cynical all we want….we can say they are all alike, but how do we know until we try? Should we just not vote, take our lumps, be told what to do and be complacent?

812070,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-10 19:49:00,4399,Everybody who voted Liberal in the last election knew what they were getting in McGuinty he had a well established track record of lying and mis-management so if you voted Liberal in the last election you got what you voted for.....enjoy!!!!
812072,davew3,2013-10-10 19:57:00,430,"Folks,  this cannot be the only place you discuss this.  This should be discussed with fellow workers, family and friends.  We have to make these people accountable.  Me personally, I cannot afford to throw my money away.  Or be forced to work to an elderly age because there is no pension left.  67 now !!  ( But not for the politicians)  Now I am no crusader that you are going to see on the news but you can bet the people I know are going to hear me.  And maybe even people I don't know.  Regards"
812073,workwear,2013-10-10 20:01:00,592,"What is the differance, it doesn't matter who you vote for they all do the same thing! They lie, break promisses, raise our taxes and give themselves lavish pensions and nothing ever gets done about it. There is no accountability, if they get caught stealing they just pay it back and all is forgiven because they are all doing it. I keep hearing ""if you don't vote you deserve what you get!"" I have voted in every election since I was old enough to vote. Different party names but it is all the same game!   finally someone who truly understands!!!"

Perhaps we need to do the same?......"

812088,outllaw,2013-10-10 22:01:00,1232,and the judge just gave Kwame Kilpatrick 28 years in Detroit. why cant Canadians have a justice system that would do something. policticians should be held accountable and jailed.
812091,glen,2013-10-10 22:10:00,2641,"28 years lol.  Agents who pored over bank accounts and credit cards said Kilpatrick spent $840,000 beyond his salary during his time as mayor. Defense attorneys tried to portray the money as generous gifts from political supporters who opened their wallets for birthdays or holidays.  How many years do you get for 1.1B."
812093,Terry,2013-10-10 22:25:00,14456,How many years do you get for 1.1B.   4 more years as leader of the liberal party
