463460,pikeguy,2010-05-06 03:12:00,195,"when u launch you'r boat and go under the bridge look strait ahead thats oak island. on your way to that look to the Right you will see the bay's the third on is a good place to go.  go from the point and aim for the island, do not go behind the island shallow water even more so this year ,The other side of that island to the big patch of weeds  is good to. Send me your address i will send you a map for some more places to go and try it will just take less time that way    "
