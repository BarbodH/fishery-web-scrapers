463976,Disspatcher,2010-05-07 14:29:00,73," If its not a large boat..woodbine to Ravenshoe, East past Queensway to Lake Dr. turn right follow North to launch on left side. 1 or 2 stop signed north."
463981,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-07 14:41:00,3761,As a side note it blows my mind that city's charge people money to park their vehicle/trailer for the day...honestly tax's should be able to pay enough...maybe for the first year or so of a completely re-made boat ramp to help cover expenses but not for 10+...kinda like Port Perry's ramp.  Sorry I can't help you
464012,cityfisher,2010-05-07 15:27:00,959,good idea... need something like the bog
