463433,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-06 02:10:00,435,"Went out for some Pike fishing in Toronto on Tuesday. I only got 1 small guy but saw 3 fish that were at least 35-40 inches sitting right on the bottom not moving and inch. I had time to put 3 or 4 lures in front of these fish and they wouldn't even move... I even bumped my soft swimabait off of the nose of one! He didn't even move after a tap in the face by a lure, what the hell!!! I'm going to try again tomorrow but who knows. Saw a bunch of people fishing who also weren't having much luck, forgot to ask who's on OFC, Had a little chat with the Fishing Fury guys but forgot to introduce myself and ask for some of those sexy spinners    -Ben"

463454,GBW,2010-05-06 02:51:00,8460,"nice fish Ben. Here you go for those that ""are in the know"" so others don't know... "

463477,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-06 08:00:00,435," LOL I knew someone would mention that! I actually took the time to blur it then thought to myself, why do I care if someone sees where I caught a dink pike!? Don't worry I'll blur the 40 incher  -Ben"
463521,mepps,2010-05-06 13:51:00,1301,"I know that spot even with the blur!  Good to meet you the other day, Tuesday was a really tough day. I managed just one pike too. Wednesday was a great day though - I'll get a report together soon!"
