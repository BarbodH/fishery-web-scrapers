463978,TJQ,2010-05-07 14:36:00,7806,"Took Monique and the kids up to camp to try out the new bike and do a bit of riding and fishing. One things for sure, it should be a great year for partridge up north, they are everywhere. Almost as thick as the bears.. Just before the turn off for camp we saw 5 bears beside the road, a momma and 4 cubs.. I couldn't believe it. I've seen them with two cubs before, but never 4... here's some pictures, The sun was in a bad place, and I never did get them all in the same picture.. but there were definitely five.. just ask Muskie.. he was going ballistic in the back of the vehicle lol.                         Why you should always put your tackle away...     The fish were finally biting, although we didn't get out too much.      Got my new bass lights up... I need about 4 more strands to do the whole porch.     Great picture of Jaden and Mom.. Jadens wearing her xmas present to bed.... BackFlap and all!    Muskie enjoying his boat ride.     Another great weekend.. gonna get back up there soon!"
463982,Roy,2010-05-07 14:41:00,13728,I re-planted some shrubs and did the lawn this morning....you and your whole family make me sick. I hope the bears drink all your beer.

464000,ctranter,2010-05-07 15:08:00,543,I've never seen that many blackbears in one spot without being surrounded by a field of garbage.  Great pics
464002,TJQ,2010-05-07 15:10:00,7806,"Thanks... hey what can I say.... next weekend it back to camp. Better than sitting at home. Pools not ready yet... and the lawn needs mowing . best to be somewhere else.  I always have a bear tag.. I really hope I don't need to use it.. its not my favorite thing to do, thats for sure."
464011,discophish,2010-05-07 15:26:00,392,"Are you sure those aren't squirrels?  The squirrels these days have been feasting on their fall harvest leftovers, so they can be quite large during the spring season, and often mistaken for bears."
464073,Joey,2010-05-07 19:11:00,9122,"Cool pictures TJ.  I hope you don't have to use your tags either.  Jaden sure has Monique's eyes, just gorgeous.  Nice bass too  So that really is a b...ass lure  Joey"
