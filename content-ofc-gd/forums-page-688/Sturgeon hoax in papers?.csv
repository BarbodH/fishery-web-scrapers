463315,wuchikubo,2010-05-05 21:29:00,1114,"My receptionist out front asked me if I had heard about the 1000lb sturgeon caught from Kenora (as the paper reports). I looked at the pic at it was a pic I have definitely seen in the past on here (boat in the background with about 11 guys holding a sturgeon in the water. Sounds familiar?) Anyways, I wanted to look up the post to confirm it, anyone else have the link to the original post?  Why don't the newspaper journalist don't seem to verify their stories before publishing it?!!  I'll see if I can find a link on the paper's website, apparently they reported it was information from the Toronto Star."
463320,Roy,2010-05-05 21:40:00,13728,"They don't need to verify the story, Stan. Their mission is to sell papers, get folks to visit their website and try to get as many people talking about them."
463321,Muskieman,2010-05-05 21:45:00,2472,I've seen it to and have received e-mail about it being caught in here Sturgeon Falls  and in the French or Red Rivers.... If I'm not mistaken the pic you seen is a Sturgeon caught in the Fraser River in B.C. A real fish nonetheless. RFS 
463323,wuchikubo,2010-05-05 21:51:00,1114,"All very true Roy, but it's annoying nonetheless.     Yes, Randy, I'm talking about that Fraser River Sturgeon pic. I'm not saying the fish was a fake, just the story behind it.  Stan"
463324,Muskieman,2010-05-05 21:54:00,2472,  Is this it?.....   not a fake.... I seen a 750lb  near Port Coquitlam in 1994... the story that's posted isn't true not from Kenora.  RFS 
463328,Roy,2010-05-05 22:00:00,13728,We caught one JUST like that at an OFC get together.....you still have the pic Terry?
463332,Terry,2010-05-05 22:05:00,14456,
463338,fish_fishburn,2010-05-05 22:31:00,1311,I would put my money on the Fraser River for that one.
463357,wuchikubo,2010-05-05 23:18:00,1114,"Yes, Randy, that's the exact same pic in the papers. As I mis-typed earlier and meant, I believe the fish to be real just not from Ontario."
463364,ciceri,2010-05-05 23:42:00,535," If I worked for a newspaper, or knew someone, I'd have that published too, lol."
463372,Rizzo,2010-05-05 23:57:00,4754,"humber river actually. the boat in the background is actually stuck between a shopping cart and an old tire. Yup, good 'ol humber browns we used to call them. That's just a little one"
463382,irishfield,2010-05-06 00:20:00,26272,Biggest piece of tail I ever had a hand on.. I can tell ya that !!
463429,rock34,2010-05-06 02:05:00,215,"I have seen that pic and heard that it was caught in Southampton, Ontario as well as Wasaga Beach.  That one has been around and reported everywhere.  Since were talking about Sturgeon....Last July, Fraser River.  5ppl, 2.5hrs, 9ft exactly 480lbs.  Ive never felt power like this in my life.  It was intense.    "
463462,Nipfisher,2010-05-06 03:26:00,2449,That's a big fish Rock. Terry that is a funny picture.
463466,skeeter,2010-05-06 03:56:00,1907,what do you mean FALSE reports as to the different locations????????????????????????????  have you guy's never heard of catch & release?????? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
463596,Mike Pike,2010-05-06 16:18:00,1332,"I'm willing to bet that that story and pic was never actually published in a newspaper.  It was made to LOOK like a newspaper article, but the only place I believe it was 'published' was the internet.  Although the pic is legit the accompanying story isn't which claims the fish was caught in places where such sturgeon don't exist.  One heck of a fish, though!"
463615,NAW,2010-05-06 17:08:00,4022,I saw that exact picture saying it was caught in lake huron.  I was e-mailed to be about 8 or 9 years ago...  Been around for a while..
463617,anders,2010-05-06 17:22:00,1168,Rock...two awesome pictures
463626,4thgen,2010-05-06 17:57:00,157,"I received that picture/story as an internet forward, to which I replied: That's a white sturgeon, not a lake sturgeon so this picture was taken on the west coast, probably the Fraser River. It is a big white sturgeon, but by no means is it a record. I really don't see the point in finding a cool picture, making up a ridiculous story and then sending it to everyone you know."
463629,TJQ,2010-05-06 18:03:00,7806,HOAX... no way... you can clealry see me in the picture!! I was there I tell you!!
463664,Twocoda,2010-05-06 19:42:00,4130,Nice dinosaur Rock !!!!! ive only caught one in my life and it was only 49 lbs 54 inches long ....that alone was intense ....i can only imagine ( for the time being) how yours felt on the rod
463726,rock34,2010-05-06 22:05:00,215," Yeah it was fun.  first fish of the day too.  We actually lost one similar size 1hr into the fight later that day, there was a knot in the line  I brought up this exact picture to our guide when I was there because I was gullible (not sure how to spell) enough to believe that it was caught in Lake Huron at the time.  He told me that it was caught in the Fraser in 2000 or 2001 and that it has circulated everywhere.  It was caught 1km up river from the Mission bridge."
