463682,kickingfrog,2010-05-06 20:15:00,8333,With all the openers and spring fishing trips at this time of year I thought this just might slip someone's mind. Plus now that I've bought my cards you can have at the left-overs.
463687,irishfield,2010-05-06 20:18:00,26272,"Thanks for the reminder Rob ! One call that I, unfortunately, don't have to make this year.... but it reminds me to kick the kids! Both girls come in from Paris Friday night and it will be the last thing on their minds to have taken care of..."

463702,Roy,2010-05-06 20:43:00,13728,Oh and here's another helpful hint. NEVER buy them anything with a cord.
463704,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-06 20:47:00,4399,  Yes cordless is much better!!!
463715,JohnF,2010-05-06 21:15:00,3494,Does a big prime rib count?  JF
463716,Billy Bob,2010-05-06 21:16:00,5865,As long as you include a good supply of batteries...
463765,HTHM,2010-05-06 23:47:00,4082,I'm covered. Now I just have to fund my kids presents. The boat fund is takin' a hit!
