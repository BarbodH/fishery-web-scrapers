How is the fishing?  The accomidations?  Thanks, just looking for some stories (good or bad) before I book.  I know that its on the French river system but that's all I know about it.  Is it a good place to spend a week? thanks everyone for some insight   Thanks all!"

In the evening go up the river as far as you can go, drop an anchor and fish with minnows. Casting off the docks you will never know what you will hook into.  They also have a great buffet night.  Beware the bugs though.  Buy a bug jacket.  Have fun."

You can catch everything from largemouth, smallmouth, pike, muskie, walleye and even perch.  We've always had good luck in the area.  Lots of islands and rocks just below the surface so go slow the first few times just to be safe.  I second the idea of asking for a cabin on the river.  It's nice to go out and fire out some baits while everyone is sitting around the fire."

463589,Rich Clemens,2010-05-06 15:48:00,3131, We'd love to hear about your trip when you get back.   I'll be at Wolseley in early September - just let me one or two will ya.
