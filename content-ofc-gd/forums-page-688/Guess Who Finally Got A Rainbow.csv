463426,The JAY,2010-05-06 01:54:00,239,"Wow, I pass creeks like that all the time, and would never have guessed there would be fishies like that in them. Nice work!"
463427,GBW,2010-05-06 02:00:00,8460,"Not a problem Dann!  Any time we can get out it's always fun, fish or no fish.  If you can't tell from the pic, there is a rather large drop off behind Dann that he had to get down to get that fish after it was hooked.  Glad it was him and not me doing that climb, LOL!"
463436,GBW,2010-05-06 02:16:00,8460,"Um, Dann, you should have done the ""standard"" blurr or twirls... "
463437,skeeter,2010-05-06 02:19:00,1907,"rutt roww i better go see the DR,"
463440,GBW,2010-05-06 02:22:00,8460,"I wasn't trying to hide ""man boobs"" but I was trying to ""cover"" your watch so people wouldn't know what time we were fishing at.  yeah, that's it..."
463445,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-06 02:30:00,10439,"UH, Where's the river?"
463450,GBW,2010-05-06 02:41:00,8460,"In Ontario.  FYI, I made the pick look like there are man boobs but Miss Kelly is prob. going to hit me for that..."
463455,Mattones,2010-05-06 02:55:00,587,Eh look there is a deer in the background on the right side! Muahahaa.  Great fish!

463518,torco,2010-05-06 13:44:00,656,"LOL. I think its safe to say most people know where most spots are out east.  I love the deer in the back corner, didn't see it at first!  Congrats guys on a successful outing."
463524,young_one,2010-05-06 14:06:00,620,"Nice fish Skeeter! What you catch it on? Nice spot you got there, no overhanging tree snag, nor submerged snag fest! LOL I love that hidden dear in the distance!   So GBW is still goose egg, and 'enjoying' the art of centerpin?"

463645,MJL,2010-05-06 18:53:00,2427,Congrats Skeeter on your first bow  I'd be tempted to chuck a few spinners or kwikfish in that creek at night to see if there are any resident browns that live there...

463890,GBW,2010-05-07 04:00:00,8460,"Wasn't it the mallows?  LOL! I went back this evening on my way home.  ALL bow's were gone, ALL suckers were gone and that DAMN deer was gone.. Glad I didn't bring a rod on that walk as it would have got in the way...  The rain has pushed them SOUTH..."
