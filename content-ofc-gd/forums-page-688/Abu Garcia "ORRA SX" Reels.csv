I've narrowed it down to these 3...  The Abu Revo S for $129 The Shimano Citica for $129 ...ORRR.....The Abu ORRA SX (????) for $99  My question is ... Has any one used or seen or heard of any one that has used the new Abu ORRA SX ??? They have come out with a braking system similar to Shimano and I was wondering if there was any feed back ?  BPS doesnt sell them by the looks of it, so I couldnt read any reviews on them.  Thanks for any help !"
