463168,DMASSE,2010-05-05 11:39:00,420,"Hello  I usually get ready for walleye opener on the third weekend of may, but my buddy who fishing the dams on opener told me that the season has changed and that the opener  is this weekend.  We usually fish Hasting to Bobcaygeon.  Can anyone help me out to confirm this is true...  I looked in my regs but couldnt find any info...   any help would be appreciated  Dave"
463175,EC1,2010-05-05 12:39:00,930,"From what I read, it's the second saturday in May where it opens, so you should be good for this weekend. If someone knows that it's different, please correct me. If I'm right, I am going walleye fishing this weekend!"
463176,Lunkerhunter,2010-05-05 12:41:00,455,zone 17 (kawartha's) is open may 8 for walleye http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr_e001336.pdf
463185,skeeter,2010-05-05 13:14:00,1907,new regs aswell sport is 4 walleye must be between 35-50cm
463190,snoozer,2010-05-05 13:27:00,7,"Check the Zone 17 (Kawarthas) Exceptions.  Most, but not all, fast water areas below dams are sanctuaries until the third Saturday in May."
463191,mbac31,2010-05-05 13:31:00,904,"Its open this friday night 12 am. Balsam, Mitchell and Gull river system have exceptions other than the regular rules. Keep note of this. Some area are sanctuaries until 3rd saturday but its a go elsewhere in zone 17"
463192,Stoty,2010-05-05 13:32:00,2910,"It's always been the 2nd Saturday in May, as far as I know."
463195,jimmer,2010-05-05 13:35:00,2730,"I know the dam in Lindsay doens't open until the weekend after the regular opener. I would think that all the dams fall under the same rulings.  Check the acceptions in the regs and as a past poster said, remember that there is a new slot in FMZ 17.  Only 13.8"" - 19.7"" in standard measurement can be kept, all other released. Good Luck out there!"
463199,jimmer,2010-05-05 13:45:00,2730,"http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr_e001336.pdf This is the link to the exceptions (spelling mistake in first post, duh). It looks like most of the dams open the friday after the second Saturday in May if I read them correctly."
463205,skeeter,2010-05-05 13:55:00,1907,"It looks like most of the dams open the friday after the second Saturday in May if I read them correctly  yes that is correct. but read carefully.  friday after the second Saturday in May = the 3rd saturday, may 15th  i miss read it myself the first time."
463208,jimmer,2010-05-05 13:59:00,2730,It is weird how they have it written.
463210,fish-miester,2010-05-05 14:01:00,864,agreed.. they should make the regulations a little easier to understand lol
463273,Keenan,2010-05-05 18:02:00,59,"It opens May 15th below the dam, they have signs posted all over down there."
463343,muskeybugged,2010-05-05 22:44:00,282," If they did that then how would the C.O.'s catch people if they knew ""clearly"" they were not supposed to fish there?"
463346,fish-miester,2010-05-05 22:57:00,864,  ya I guess thats true..! then I'm sure we would have even less C.O's
463444,Dutch,2010-05-06 02:30:00,831,"Many fast water areas are sanctuaries in the Kawarthas.  The Otonabee River is also closed from lock 19 to bensfort bridge.  Always opens a week after.  Remember the slot size, basically 14-19 inches (rounding up on the low end, down on the high end), and only keep 4 with a sport license, only 1 with a conservation license (I think)."
