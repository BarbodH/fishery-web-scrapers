Here is a last ice pic of of some monster Jumbo's on the last week of March when I had my son out on Simcoe.... 1 month later we fished the Georgina Fishing Series Perch Attach on Simcoe this past Sat. and won 'Big Fish' for the overall biggest perch brought in and 3rd place for the heaviest bag of 15 Perch that won us $1,800.00 cash for the day .... great day on the water fishing with my son!     Take care and good fish'n... Greg."

463331,oldphart,2010-05-05 22:04:00,665,"~~~~Drat was hopen to make that Derby couldn't get a partner. Congrats on 3rd. place, and monster Perch. Next Year bud, I'll be sit off your stern"
463336,fish-miester,2010-05-05 22:17:00,864,congrats! sounds like a good time !
463352,ciceri,2010-05-05 23:11:00,535,Nice. I'll have to enter that event some time.
463353,fish-miester,2010-05-05 23:12:00,864,  if I had a boat big enough for Simcoe I'd take ya.. but I dont think my 14' + 9.9 would like it out there very much !
463356,ciceri,2010-05-05 23:16:00,535," I was thinking I'd use my 12' and 9.9, lmao. Gotta pick and choose your days I suppose."
463359,wuchikubo,2010-05-05 23:20:00,1114,Congrats Greg on the 3rd place finish and the monster perch. I'm hoping I'll have a bit more time to fish this summer.
463378,misfish,2010-05-06 00:14:00,29133,Hey Greg. Congrats to you and your son.   Good to hear from you again.
463387,spinnerbaitking,2010-05-06 00:33:00,1622,Great Report hard to say who's smiling more Congrats Richard
463435,Dutch,2010-05-06 02:15:00,831,"Greg, I always enjoy your reports.  Thanks."
463448,ctranter,2010-05-06 02:32:00,543,That perch is bigger than most bass I catch  Nice post
463459,charlesn,2010-05-06 03:08:00,551,"The fish weighed 1.38 lbs which was a great fish on a very tough day.  Good job with your son Greg!  As far as the comments about a 9.9, I believe there was a little tinny with a 9.9 in the event and another little boat with like maybe a 20 HP motor.  Great to see these guys come out and compete.  It ain't the boat or motor that catches the fish."
463465,Cudz,2010-05-06 03:54:00,2652,Nice perch. I can't figure out what type of vehicle/vessel/hut you are fishing out of on the hardwater.  Do you have a pic of it?  Is it a vehicle of some sort?
463468,ciceri,2010-05-06 04:38:00,535,Argo with a hard top?
463479,fish_fishburn,2010-05-06 09:53:00,1311,"Nicely done. Which one of you caught the big un? How do you split the cash win 50/50. I tried the 1/3 for each,with my nephew last summer, 1/3 for me 1/3 for him and 1/3 for the boat... Made for some good conversation on the way home haa. But I gave him half."
463620,Leecher,2010-05-06 17:35:00,7832,"OMG, a freak of nature Congrats Greg and son on your 3rd place finish Leechman"
463632,Slayingm,2010-05-06 18:21:00,204,"LucG - That Perch was 14.25"" long and weighted in at 1.38lbs. OldPhart: Missed you out there this year and look foward to next.  $10K guaranteed payout should see more teams in 2011! Stan: Good to hear from you man and good luck on the water this year! Cudz: Funny guy... ya.. hardtop Argo in the winter and 21' Stratos Walleye boat on the soft water... included pics of both. http://profishntangl...es/100_0488.jpg   http://profishntangl...com/MyPictures/Gregs New Argo2.jpg   Take care and good luck all....
