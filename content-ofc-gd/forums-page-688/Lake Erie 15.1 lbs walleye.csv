462823,Bob Devine,2010-05-04 12:57:00,251,Here is a pic of a PIC 15.1 lbs caught by my team mate Ross Robertson of Big Water Fishing Pro Team. You can find more at http://www.bigwaterfishing.com/pro_team.php This was caught in the western basin of Lake Erie. The troll bite is starting to heat up so if you are looking to book a trip I suggest you contact a guide soon as many will already have their wknds spoken for.
