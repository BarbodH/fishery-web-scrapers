463036,Marko,2010-05-04 23:06:00,854,"Had a day off yesterday and what better way to spend my day then to fish. Stayed local, places i have not been to yet this yea. Fished from 8 am until about 1pm, here are few pics. Fish were in spawning mood and not interested in feeding at times. First 5 casts i think i had 5 fish on, then the fish got spooked and it slowed down.      .  Did manage to catch another mirror, second or third already this year.           I caught about half of dozen of suckers as well, and few rock bass. After i had completely spook them, decided to move again. Water in this place was really murky and i was not expecting to catch anything but boy was i wrong. Had a run every 5-10 minutes for good 2 hrs. Here are few pics         .  Got a few more but did not bother taking anymore pics. This guy would appear more then few times. I think he was letting me know that i was intruding on his territory. He would just stick his head out and stare at me for minutes at time and then disappear. He was a decent size turtle, almost made me feel uncomfortable every time i had to net my fish.   All in all a great day, between 20 and 30 fish caught, cant really complain. There were no monsters caught but the quantity made up for it. Hope you guys enjoy it.  Tight lines"

463675,hammercarp,2010-05-06 20:09:00,964,WTG Marko! That's hauling.
463724,Marko,2010-05-06 22:04:00,854, I switched to the hair-rig later in the day when i changed fishing spots. FIrst place i went to was really shallow so i was just using corn and bottom bouncing it in pools full of carp. Second place was much deeper and water was muddy so i used hair rig with a feeder to attract some fish.
463730,Marko,2010-05-06 22:09:00,854, I was wondering why you weren't picking up your phone. I completely forgot that you went away for couple of weeks lol. When are you coming back anyways??
463732,Marko,2010-05-06 22:10:00,854,Thanks for the comments guys. This year has been good to me when it comes to catching mirrors. This is already second one i got this year and only been out like dozen times.
