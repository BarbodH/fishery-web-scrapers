463492,KingKarp,2010-05-06 12:01:00,2,  It's real - Wels Catfish
463493,cuzza,2010-05-06 12:05:00,467,"Yeah - they're real alright, Google for River Ebro Catfish to see more of the same. Apparently it's like tying your line to the back of someone's car!"
463497,aplumma,2010-05-06 12:45:00,6896,Come on down to Virginia we use them things for bait.   Art
463507,anders,2010-05-06 13:20:00,1168," Hahaha..how do you hook them, through the tail, or lip?  I always wondered about that."
463545,aplumma,2010-05-06 14:56:00,6896, Thru the lip that way you can get your bait back... While the bait is only $100.00 each the cost of the livewell I built for them was the big expense.     Art
