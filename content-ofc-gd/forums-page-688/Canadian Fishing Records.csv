461328,Stoty,2010-04-29 19:18:00,2910,"Can anyone tell me the location of the Canadian Live Release records? My dad hooked/fought/and lost a MONSTER fish today (25-30lbs) on 8 lb test line, and it got me thinking whether or not his could have set a new line record.  I can't seem to locate the records online though?"
461330,anders,2010-04-29 19:20:00,1168,what kind of fish...thats huge
461334,Stoty,2010-04-29 19:24:00,2910,"We were Pike fishing, but it was a Musky. Honest to god..the biggest fish I've ever seen. Easily 50+"" A fish of a lifetime, no doubt!"
461336,Raf,2010-04-29 19:25:00,3495,"well it would not have, because it was out of season."
461337,anders,2010-04-29 19:25:00,1168,sweet!
461340,Stoty,2010-04-29 19:33:00,2910,I'm aware of that...
461341,daryl0815,2010-04-29 19:34:00,225,"http://www.igfa.org/records/default.aspx  you can try that, but I think that it wants you to sign up for something, because it is saying that you have to enter your username and password or become a memeber, but this is world records, not canadian but they do have line class records or so they say.  Does a fish have to be in season for it to be entered as a new world record? I dont know that it does"
461342,Raf,2010-04-29 19:35:00,3495,"the IGFA is the only organization I am aware of that keeps line records.  you may want to check their website.  I don't know that they have a live release category though.  btw, if I am not mistaken, the O'brien record fish was caught on 8lb test. Although it was clubbed."
461344,daryl0815,2010-04-29 19:36:00,225,"I just looked into it and it costs money to join to gain access to the records, what a scam"
461345,Raf,2010-04-29 19:37:00,3495,There's lotsa things that are a scam about the IGFA hahahaha  and yes a fish has to be in-season.
461346,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-29 19:43:00,0,  hahahahaha was that all?.....
461424,johnl,2010-04-30 00:18:00,197,i think i'd be clubbin' and stabbin the one in gbfisher's pic !

461464,bigugli,2010-04-30 01:36:00,6138,The Canadian and Ontario records used to be listed on Italo's site.
461658,bucktail,2010-04-30 19:25:00,1857,"All IGFA records have to conform to all rules  in this case MNR regs. That monster bass caught in Japan took so long to confirm because it was rumoured to be caught in a ""no fishing "" area."
461662,Muskieman,2010-04-30 19:41:00,2472,"I once caught a 8.5Lb Walleye on a Berkley Elite fly rod with a 3Lb leader while using a streamer.... I was 16 or so back then .I cleaned it and cooked it. On Christmas of that year my Sis-in-Law bought me a book called ""Gamefish of North America"" and in the back there were all of the North American records both C&K  &  C&R and line class/species.  Turns out I had blown away the ""Walleye on a fly"" record by more than 5 LBS. I was too little too late..  RFS "
