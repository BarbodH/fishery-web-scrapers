463793,johnl,2010-05-07 00:41:00,197,Do you have to register a 14 foot boat in ontario if it's not on a trailer and is in the back of a truck?
463797,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-07 00:45:00,10439," The only reason you need to register is if you are running a motor bigger than 10HP. Just because it's on a trailer you don't need to register, just plate the trailer."
463799,johnl,2010-05-07 00:55:00,197,thanks for the info
463808,HTHM,2010-05-07 01:18:00,4082,"As has been said you don't have to register, however it would be nice if there is one more way of identifiying the boat if stolen or the (lets face it) body. And it is free."
463818,fish-miester,2010-05-07 01:32:00,864,  good point
463877,Dara,2010-05-07 03:16:00,3052,  But then you are required to carry the paperwork on it...and anybody stealing it is taking the numbers off
