They seem to go a step beyond Rapala finish and quality, and was wondering if anyone knew if they were sold in Canada.  I know of a few American websites that sell them, but the selection isn't always the best and I would like to see some in person.  Does anyone know a retailer that sells Megabass tackle? (GTA preferred if given the option)   http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Megabass_Ito_Vision_110/descpage-MB110.html#pImage  ^ this with the GG perch pattern is my dream lure."
