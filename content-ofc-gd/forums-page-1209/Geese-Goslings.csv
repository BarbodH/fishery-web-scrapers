One of the goslings had fallen into a space between two large rocks,and [according to my wife] was having trouble getting out, and the parent geese were very agitated.Jackie went closer to see if she could do anything[being a nature lover  ]. One of the Geese rose up and ran at her.hissing and flapping its wings.Wifey ran like h***  As I was telling her of the danger's near Geese / goslings, the trapped one got out of the hole and all was quiet once again!!"

Never had on attack me but his and chase yes... they will give you a good bruise with their bite though... My little brother once got attacked by a VERY large swan and it bit him on the back of the leg giving him a huge welt... scared him soo much he didn't wanna fish the lake anymore lol...
75866,Daplumma,2007-05-28 01:18:00,1961,I was attacked by a goose on a stand up jet ski in a no wake zone once.On a stand up ski you have to be on your knees or sort of dragging behind the ski when not on plane.That was a lot of hate to be sure.It quickly became a wake zone and I would take a ticket over a goose bite every time!Your better half did well for herself to run.
