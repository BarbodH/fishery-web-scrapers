Since I have never been there, but heard some wonderful things about it I am wondering if anyone on here can tell me if I am going to be wasting my time or not?  I know I can go and make my 3rd official ""last"" trip for rainbow of the season and probably be successful, but I really would love to get some perch and have it for supper with my Grandma.  If anyone knows if they are in Port Bruce yet please let me know?"
