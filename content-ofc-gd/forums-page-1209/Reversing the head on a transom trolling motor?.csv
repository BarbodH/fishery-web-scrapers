76061,redmanca,2007-05-28 14:04:00,7,Has anyone ever reversed the head on a transon mount trolling motor so that it can be mounted and used on the bow of the boat. I would love to mount a hand control motor on the front of my small boat but I cant justify the price tag of a foot controlled bow mount motor.  Any ideas I would love to hear about them!  Thanks in advance! Redmanca
