75579,Ron,2007-05-27 03:19:00,1683,WAYNE!  GET BACK TO WORK ON THE CUSTOMERS PLANES!
75580,irishfield,2007-05-27 03:23:00,26272,Thanks Ron! Someone needed to kick me...other than my Doctor that dropped by this afternoon... that suggested maybe a room around the corner from here!
75629,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-27 13:23:00,0,"I guess well nuts may not work for all that excessive weight. All I have on my brackets are a couple of downeasters with a couple of rods with tips in the water and sometimes they get hammered by 40 pound muskies.  I actually had problems with my last ones, it seams that the ones I was getting from CT were crap. The nut was round and could be just be cranked right through the rubber. But I did find the ones with a propper nut and these brackets will never come off.  As for my boat I waited way to long to put it for sale and I did get a great offer but it was to late to get a new one in time for the season. Thats to bad as the deal won't be as good next fall.   I actually don't mind keeping it, I'm so busy these days I could not find the time to rig up a new boat."

75638,brickNblock,2007-05-27 13:54:00,598,"Lemmesee..... I was green w/Envy last year when you went out and purchased all them exellent musky rods/reels. Looking at the pics of your new rig in this post........ Well, lets just say my bottom jaw is still on the ground....and I'm 6-3. AWESOME,...............awesome job Wayne. Wish I were comming to Lakair this summer to see this marvel."
75648,glen,2007-05-27 14:26:00,2641,That is one nice boat.  When you are done rigging it it will be easier to catch fish.  Having the right gear makes   a big difference.   I have to wipe the slobber off of the key board just thinking about it.
75650,JFR,2007-05-27 14:40:00,498,"Nice work Wayne.  You gotta do it yourself, then it's done right the first time.  You put a lot of thought and time into your needs for fishing and boating.  Hope there's a spot come late fall  John"
75715,Cast-Away,2007-05-27 19:24:00,790,"Wayne, I've said it before and I'll say it again; ""you are one quality guy""! By the way, you need to take down your Evinrude poster now that you have a Merc!"
75723,SlowPoke,2007-05-27 20:07:00,2984,"LOL!! Actually, I think that is at the dealer... no plate on the trailer."
75747,misfish,2007-05-27 21:19:00,29133,"Actually Wayne ,I have some wiring I need done. I want to put in a breaker panel,can ya fit me in say MONDAY morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Nice work bud."
75884,irishfield,2007-05-28 01:42:00,26272,"Yes Cast-Away...that picture is from Feb at the dealer.  Played in her again today. Installed a HD ""lighter"" plug, back in the rear access compartment, to run the plug in coleman cooler off the kickers battery. The Verado charges both it's battery and the kicker battery thru an isolator, but i can kill the kicker battery and still start the Verado.    Then like I've been doing since I was about 12 years old... when my Mom bought that brand new 8 track stereo system from Sears...I gotta tear new things apart. Seriously, Lund expected the forward battery hatch hinge to take the load of a person or persons walking on it. It was already bending down from the dealer just doing the Lowrance network install in the front hatch. Added a piece of 1/8"" thick 1.5"" x .75"" 6061-T6 alum angle and now I can jump on it...the way it should have been when built!         And YES Ronnie....I'll work on the customers stuff tomorrow !"
75913,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-28 02:43:00,0,You always work in yer socks???
75915,irishfield,2007-05-28 02:45:00,26272,Na...it was pouring rain outside and I walked thru the mud between the shop and the hangar. Didn't wanna mess it up too much just yet! At least they're my good socks and me toes ain't showin...  Is your front hatch the same Andy?
75916,Greencoachdog,2007-05-28 02:54:00,8163,A Coleman stove eh!!!... where's the Back Bacon Hoser???
75917,irishfield,2007-05-28 02:57:00,26272,I thought you was bringin it Dawg!
75924,Greencoachdog,2007-05-28 03:25:00,8163," I can do that!... what is a Back Bacon???  Oh!... and if ya grill some Hot Dogs, let those drippings go into the lake! You'll have hoards of Catfish circling your boat in no time!!!  May be good for some Tourney points."
75937,Ron,2007-05-28 03:44:00,1683, What????? Is it something I said??? lol
76035,Landlocked,2007-05-28 13:11:00,171,"Hey Wayne, The battery compartment on my Pro-V is under the rod locker storage which is real solid but I get where you're coming from...the entire front half of my boat is storage and some of the compartments do flex quite a bit.   NOW STOP IT!!!  I barely have time to fish let alone keep up with all these cool modifications/ideas of yours!!"
76048,Tomcat,2007-05-28 13:39:00,395,"Wayne:  I'd just like to say thanks for sharing these modifciations and enhancements to your new ride with the rest of us. At least for me, it's a real education. Thanks"
76122,cisco,2007-05-28 15:33:00,597,
76146,irishfield,2007-05-28 16:32:00,26272,"Thanks Chris...like you say this is my boat for the next 20 years. Couldn't afford the depreciation hit to do another one....  And Tom..that's exactly why I put up the ""how to"" pictures. Thought others could learn from them, for when the time comes to do their own set up.  Just found the issue with the electric brake lock out solenoid for backing up (SUPPOSED to dump pressure so brakes don't come on in reverse)...Shoreland didn't bother to ground the trailer frame and expected the chains/hitch etc to compete the circuit to the brake solenoid. Guess now that they are using LED's and taking the ground wire right into the sealed units someone forgot about the brake solenoid needing a ground wire. Amazing just how much juice can come out of 12V thru a wound solenoid when you jumper to your bumper with a bare wire to get ground. Sent me back 5 feet...just like a good drag car ignition coil would."
76152,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-28 16:47:00,0,  Yup it is   ...but only the kids go up front anyhow.  I'm a troller...no front casting for me...EVER!...........
76197,irishfield,2007-05-28 18:17:00,26272, Well if you ever want it fixed....
75502,PERCHER,2007-05-26 23:58:00,787,Well Wayne you have got every bell and whistle now.Looks like you could stay out for a couple of days at a time.Nice looking rig and well done.I had a few electrical problems and small trim problems with my Lund also.But I blame the dealer because it all should have been caught in the P.D.I.Thats what you pay for.At least its done now .Good luck with the new craft and how about a few pictures of that Verado?Dan
75505,irishfield,2007-05-27 00:06:00,26272,"Dan, The Verado is going to take some getting use to. Digital throttle is TOUCHY..especially when throwing into reverse when docking. Click reverse and think about some throttle is enough...I just haven't taught myself that yet!    You can be going FULL bore at 55+ MPH and throw it in reverse. Engine will auto throttle down and then select reverse...I ain't gonna try it, but it can be done. Gear cut is such that pulling the power back quick is like throwing the brakes on..seat belts would be a good idea IMHO...to keep your head off the windshield.  Engine is quieter than the 9.9 kicker and you think it's shut off when you go to dock. That is why they made it so if you turn the key to start when it's already running it shuts off...as they know many will think the motor quit. If anyone is running anything else at the same dock, you have to put your ear to the engine cowl to hear it run.  "
75512,PERCHER,2007-05-27 00:16:00,787,That motor looks awesome.They should come out with some smaller models even a tiller would be cool.
75540,Terry,2007-05-27 01:51:00,14456,ah.....boys and their toys..........
75541,irishfield,2007-05-27 01:56:00,26272,More stuff tidy'd up today. Planner mast lines retriever finished up    Drilled and tapped an end cap on each side for the rope stay.    Ripped that brand new stove apart and did some drilling. Also realized it might be REALLY smart to put it on the side WITHOUT the fuel filler on it!     Added some good Aircraft hardware    Trial fit and some wing nuts underneath    Had to turn the pressure reg line fitting around. Requires heat to break the loctite and then found if I'd done that first I would have mounted the stove an inch or so closer to the boat so the bottle would have sat on the gunnel. Oh well...2 litre bottle will fix that..and there's always one of those on board.  If you're wondering why the mounts are offset to the left...it's to clear the grease catch tray that I wanted to leave on so we're not polluting the lake.    Made up some safety cables for the rods. Great when aircaft material and tools are just a few steps away
