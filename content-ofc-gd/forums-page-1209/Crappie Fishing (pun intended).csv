76103,bbog,2007-05-28 15:11:00,665,Thought I would load up the canoe (last Saturday) and take my last shot at Crappie in the shallows. Much to my horror I arrived at my favourite Kawartha lake to find the bay taken over by Carp. The Carp were jumping and splashing and frollicking and well you get the picture!!    Combine this with 68.3 degree water and the Crappie were long gone.  Turned our misfortune into a nice little paddle around. The lake was very calm and a gorgeous day. Tossed the micro tube out along an open water weedbed to see what was around and lo and behold - Crappie! Nothing of any size but they were fairly predictable.  Kept a dozen or so around 10 inches and released all the others.  Hooked into a number of OOS Largemouth ranging a great deal in size (of course these will be no where to find when the season opens.    Caught a number of great fighting Sunnys and Rock Bass to complete the outing. Sadly I left the camera in the car when I saw the courting Carp.  What looked to be a bad day turned out to be fantastic. I guess I'll have to travel much further North now to get my next Crappie fix.    Or set my sights on a Whitefish outing to Simcoe (in a boat of course and not the canoe)  Thanks for reading and hope everyone had a great weekend.
76106,Joey,2007-05-28 15:16:00,9122,Great report.  I'm surprised the crappie were biting in that degree of water.  Good for you.  What time is dinner  Joey
76229,bbog,2007-05-28 19:49:00,665,"Sorry Joey but you missed dinner    Ice cold beer, homemade french fries and a garden salad - along with Crappie filets in Fish Crisp. It was heaven!!"
76271,Blake,2007-05-28 21:15:00,418,Great report.  Crappie in Fish Crisp sounds great.  Glad you had a good trip out.
76278,Rizzo,2007-05-28 21:28:00,4754,"Good times.  Should have tried for some carp on the ultralight gear!  Probably tow you all over the lake, or at least the swampy areas of the lake."
