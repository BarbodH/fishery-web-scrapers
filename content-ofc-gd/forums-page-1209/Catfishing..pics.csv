75491,Daplumma,2007-05-26 22:55:00,1961,"Went out on the lower Potomac for some Cats.Specifically Channel cats for the tourney.Didn't take long to get into them.Art got this guy right off.A good 19.5 incehs for team 8  We caught prolly 20 or so a good mix of blues and channels all about the same size.Art finally broke into the mid 20's with this 23.5 cat.  Here is the happy angler holding his catch.  Not a bad day,alittle hot and sticky,we got to get air conditioning on that boat soon!The big blues will be out the beginning of June then you will see some big ol' cats!I got nothing bogger than what I have already entered in the tourney so no pics for me today.Here is one from last week in case you forgot..and just to rub it in that Art couldn't pick up his pole at the right time!  Joe"
75499,Roy,2007-05-26 23:27:00,13728,Good stuff Art and Joe. What? You can't afford a mahogany cutting table? At least teak fer Gawd's sake.
75507,motv8tr,2007-05-27 00:10:00,2587,"Good stuff guys, glad to see you're enjoying the new boat, looking forward to more reports and huge fish.  Hey Art, from the looks of that  picture with you holding the cat I'd say you ate well this past winter  Maureen"

75530,Daplumma,2007-05-27 01:24:00,1961,Dont start Dawg.We spent a lot of time putting spots on that cat! Joe
75532,Smokey,2007-05-27 01:32:00,1278,Great fish Joe. Looks like you both had a great day on the water with that many fish boated. Thanks for the pics and report.

75827,aplumma,2007-05-28 00:28:00,6896,Why Roy how nice of you to volunteer to make us a new prep station. I will send you the measurements.   Actually since pops workshop is packed up for the big move I had to put that one together to keep the fish guts from getting all over the boat. After Pops gets moved in I will see if he can build us a nice board that is fitting for such a noble sport fish.  If you all are following the fishing adventures that is Possum Point power station in the back round and we are fishing on pole B  for the cats.   Art
75843,RobHall,2007-05-28 00:43:00,261, Some nice cats there.      Too bad about the sign though.  Oh well...better luck next time.  FOTB
