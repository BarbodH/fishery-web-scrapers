72133,snag,2007-05-16 03:13:00,1932,Thanks again!
72140,wolfville,2007-05-16 03:38:00,396,Thanks for the map. Has anyone tried there yet this year? I am thinking to hit it for crappie in the coming long weekend...
72155,mikeymikey,2007-05-16 04:59:00,376,I just wanna go and do some pike fishing from the shores.
72198,jediangler,2007-05-16 12:46:00,1923,I don't usually go to Island lake until mid or late June for Crappies. They always seem a little more active then. The pike are always eager to bite so I think anytime is good for them. Good luck. They give you a copy of that map at the gate when you arrive.
72202,Golfisher,2007-05-16 12:58:00,586," I was there last Saturday, for pike opener.  As always, caught a bunch of pike, most of them snot rockets, but a couple of fairly decent ones as well.  A big suprise for me was a huge OSS largemouth that nailed an x-rap; I thought bass had gone almost extinct in that lake, as I had never caught one before, but it was good to see that there still were some good bass around in that pike-infested lake.  Water temps were still a bit cold, ranging from 50 to 53, and there were hardly any new weed growth.  Fishing wasn't as good as last year's opening in terms of number, but in terms of size, it was better.  As for crappie, I didn't target them, but I heard at the dock that a couple of guys had some success."
72269,tbayboy,2007-05-16 16:05:00,1497,"Hey Golfisher, thanks for the report (and thanks for the map Mike).  I was out there a few times last year and was thinking of driving up this weekend - did they have the rental canoes out when you were there?  I have a couple shore spots but I could use the exercise of paddling around a bit"
72285,Golfisher,2007-05-16 16:45:00,586,"Tbay, yeah, the canoes and boats are out.  I rented one of those boats with a trolling motor.  I'd avoid afternoons though; it seems every time I'm at that lake, the winds always pick up in the afternoon."
72341,tbayboy,2007-05-16 18:54:00,1497,"Cool thanks Golfisher, I'll try to make it up one of the days this weekend and make the call on canoe vs motor based on the wind (or just go real cheap and hit the shore spots).  Got some bass there last year but only  a couple:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/93/233192403_b138e23a71.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Surprise bass"" /></a>"
72436,mikeymikey,2007-05-16 23:08:00,376,"  So you fished from a boat?  How about fishing from  the shores?  Will I be able to catch a lot of Pikes ?  Oh one more, do I pay at the gate to fish? How does that place work?"
72451,tbayboy,2007-05-16 23:40:00,1497,You pay on your way in - $4.25.  You get all the info you need here: http://www.creditvalleycons.com/recandleisure/islandlake.htm  I've caught pike from the shore but only one (the shoreline isn't 100% accessible so you only have a few spots to try from without a boat)
72462,Golfisher,2007-05-17 00:06:00,586,"What Tbay said:  fishing from the shore is very, very limiting.  Rent a boat or a canoe for half a day; it's well worth the expense."
72505,salmon,2007-05-17 01:56:00,334,"Guys The cost of the rental for the boats have gotten really expensive. To rent a boat with electric motor for 6 hours is $50 (2 years was $35) for the whole day it is $80. They have upped it big time, do they have more boats? It keeps the young ones busy with all the snot rockets and the occasional bass. I was surprised at the size of the largies"
72528,wolfville,2007-05-17 03:07:00,396,"There are some good size bass, I have caught some around 3lb (real 3lb, not so-called 3lb LOL) in the past years Not sure how big was the one you caught. But i am sure they're there. The thing is, it's hard to avoid them before the opener, so if you catch one in the area, it's better to move on so they are not disturbed during the spawn/pre-spawn.  The C.A has been promoting C&R for LMB and encourage you to take away pike. I guess that's working."
72543,mikeymikey,2007-05-17 03:42:00,376,Catch & Eat Pike ?  How does pike taste?  I heard it's got a lot of small bones?
72545,jediangler,2007-05-17 03:49:00,1923,"Don't forget about that awesome panfish bite.  Pops showing off a sunfish from last year.  This crappie was 13.5"" and tied a personal best. The other was caught at Guelph lake. A couple of years ago brother Joonmoon and I caught our panfish limit (25 per boat at Orangeville) in less than 4hrs. We only kept crappie between 9-11"" so we released 30 under and 6 over that self imposed slot. As well we caught a dozen pike each but all were under 20"". Great place...as long as the wind isn't howling."
75794,Stalker,2007-05-27 23:25:00,2,Is there any good spot to fish for crapie/panfish/perch with kids from shore/dock? Thaks for sharing.
75953,wolfville,2007-05-28 04:02:00,396,"Stalker, saw your other post asking for panfish spots. No, Islandlake is not good for shore fishing. A lot of poeple fish the shore but I don't think they are catching anything (at least not consistently). With a boat though, it's a totally different place."
