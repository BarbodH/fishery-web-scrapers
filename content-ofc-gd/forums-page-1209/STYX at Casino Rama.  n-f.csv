75695,Carp,2007-05-27 17:53:00,1488,"Saw Styx at Casino Rama (Orillia, Ontario) on Friday night, including a newer canadian band member some of you will be familiar with. Lawrence (Larry) Gowan.  A smart move as he fit in perfectly with the band. Tommy Shaw's voice is as solid as ever and the guitar work he and James Young (JY) displayed was wicked.  The show was awesome. One of the best concerts I've ever seen.  Afterwards, Laura and I ventured into the casino. I set her up with enough slot credits to keep her busy. While I checked out the card tables, I ran into fellow OFNCer TJ Quensel. He was at the concert too, along with his possey of buddies. One of them was getting married for the second time and he spotted his ex at the casino. What a soap opera.  Spent some time at the bar being entertained by the possey and their tutu wearing leader, who was feeling no pain. All gestures, acts, conversation and topics discussed (they talked, I nodded and smiled a lot) would not be appropriate for this board, or any other I can think of, so....... what happened at the casino, stayed at the casino.  A great night out for the Mrs. & I. We needed the break, even if it was only a few hours."
75703,fishindevil,2007-05-27 18:28:00,6254,"RIGHT ON.....sounds like a great night of entertainment....styxx have been around for along time,glad you had fun with some members,and the big cief....lol.lol   cheers"

It was my first time at Casino Rama... what a nice concert hall they had.. concert was great....  Im not sure if Gowan payed better Styx or if Styx played better Gowan...  I have to say I dont think there is a bad seat in the house!! we were up pretty high, and I know that next winter, Ill be making a weekend of it down there for me and the wife at some point in time for sure.  We wound up at one of the more upper class bars in the area.. the ""something Arms"", I can' t remember the whole name for some reason... anyway, I must say it was full of VERY friendly people... lol...."
75730,Mattitude,2007-05-27 20:26:00,155,And no one came by to say hello to me....I was pretty busy though and didn't have much time to look up.  Too bad I would've liked to have met you guys.  Hope you all had a good time!
75737,Gerritt,2007-05-27 20:37:00,6129,"LOL I could just picture TJ at the ""Arms"" LOL!!! some first class entertainment there! you have seen Orillia's finest for sure! our cottages were literally 3 minutes from Casino Rama....made for some interesting times!   sounds like an awesome night out!   Nothing beats small town ""entertainment!""     Gerritt"
75753,misfish,2007-05-27 21:33:00,29133,"I met him once too,nice guy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TJ that is.LOL"
75762,Carp,2007-05-27 21:51:00,1488," We were pressed for time Mattitude, but it would have been cool to hook up. Had to drop the kids off in Toronto and scoot up to Orillia quickly. Sat down 2 minutes before the band got on stage.  I've probably driven by hundreds of members at one time or another. I used to drive all over southern Ontario for work and stopped in many towns and cities."
75765,martymonty,2007-05-27 21:59:00,26,"Styx was my favourite band in the 70's.....still love ther music, glad you enjoyed yourself!"
75934,Joey,2007-05-28 03:41:00,9122,"Styx, LOL, should have known TJ would be there.  How old did they look  Sounds like you had a great time.  Joey"
75952,irishfield,2007-05-28 03:59:00,26272,Surprised they haven't changed their name from Styx to Logs by now... They've got that age thing goin on like all of us. And who'd a thought...TJ at the peelers...NAW couldn't be...
