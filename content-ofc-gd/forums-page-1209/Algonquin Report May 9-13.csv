71703,solopaddler,2007-05-15 02:11:00,8605," I'm dead serious, it was tough  . Really though, I figured being there for 4 days most of our time would be spent just fishing with the camera turned off, and that wasn't the case at all. It was all business for the bulk of our time spent there. Most of our time was spent trying to get each shot perfect, and believe me it's not that easy. Between stumbling over our words    and serious issues with one of the microphones not working, there were multiple takes for almost every single shot. I know I mentioned that Ben fixed one of the mic's on Wed. night, what I didn't mention was that the second mic crapped out when we were in the park. It was really frustrating... (it was fun though  )"
71706,solopaddler,2007-05-15 02:15:00,8605," Have you ever heard the term shrinkage? Seriously, the water was numbingly cold. Even holding our underwater camera in the drink for moments became physically painful!"
71720,Dano,2007-05-15 03:05:00,719,Congrats on a succesful trip! Nice specks dude.
71738,Badger Shark,2007-05-15 04:28:00,291,Man I really love these Algonquin reports.  How cool is that? going in on a film shoot.  I would love to do this.
71907,bpsbassman,2007-05-15 17:21:00,941,Great Report Solo!  Looking forward to seeing the finished product.  Keep us posted.
72330,setomonkey,2007-05-16 18:21:00,872,"Great pictures, I love Algonquin Park. Hope to see the video!  I have never fished for trout in Algonquin though. I've only gone in summer months (July or August), and fish for smallies when there's time.  Mike"
72350,Nemo,2007-05-16 19:13:00,727,Seto there's plenty 'o' Trout out and about in July and August you just need to get deep.
72362,Tomcat,2007-05-16 19:43:00,395,PriorGuy:  Were your two big specs out of Lavielle?
72370,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-16 19:56:00,191,Cool report and some awesome scenery
72475,Black_Blade,2007-05-17 00:41:00,258,"Solo...love the pics...I grew up on the east side of the park (Deep River)...seeing those pics sure makes me itch to get back in there again. Just havin' a heck of a time convincing the wife of the merits of 'real' camping     Really looking forward to seeing your venture work out and be able to watch the show!  Question:  Trout fishing in there...what kind of lures do you use, depth etc for those lakes up there?  All we ever did back home was mostly pike or walleye fishing...my dad thought bass was a garbage fish and that trolling was the only real way to fish...."

76307,irishfield,2007-05-28 23:08:00,26272,NIce report...but where'd the pictures go.........
76311,solopaddler,2007-05-28 23:24:00,8605," Sorry 'bout that Wayne, I removed the pic's from photobucket.... Things aren't looking good at the moment for Northern Explorers, doesn't look like it's going to happen (at least not right now). I think I need to create another post and make an announcement...."
71658,ehg,2007-05-15 00:23:00,2666,"The pictures and the post are great. Hopefully that's some indication of the show in works.  I think Pete Bowman and Marc Travers tried outdoor shows that didn't work due to lack of fishing, Survivorman they were not. Keep fishing in the forefront and you'll have a winner. 23 minutes ain't much.   Good luck,  ehg"
71666,Clampet,2007-05-15 00:53:00,1947,I can almost smell the fresh air. Thanks for a look into one of Canadas' foremost Provincial parks.
71670,Rich Clemens,2007-05-15 01:02:00,3131,One very nice report Mike.   As I was reading you you talking about cooking up an awsome meal ... I was already thinking of pics.  Sure enough ... you didn't disappoint.   I'll best that was a great tastin' meal.   Man I'd love to do something like that some day.  Thanks for sharing.
71678,crappiesteve,2007-05-15 01:22:00,220,Solo..What can I say Awesome Man.Dreams of many.  Steve
71691,007,2007-05-15 01:52:00,537,Fantastic report.  Thanks for sharing.  Now you've got me all excited for my forthcoming camping trip to Algonquin.  Just hope the weather and fishing stays as good as that for us and those bugs stay away.  Thanks and good luck with the tv show. 007
71693,Moosebunk,2007-05-15 01:54:00,3970,"Mike.  I think you're spoiled. lol.  No more complaining about how tough it was.  C'mon... how tough IS it going to Algonquin to camp, fish, and take pictures.  Although, you'd have to carry most people after the first fifth of that portage into lake D."
71694,Cast-Away,2007-05-15 01:55:00,790,What a great report Mike! Were you able to take a quick dip or was the water too cold?
