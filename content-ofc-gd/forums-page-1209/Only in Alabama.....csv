75243,tjsa,2007-05-25 23:02:00,1578,"C'mon now, that thing would be larger than most of the moose up here, sheesh!!!!!!!!!"
75244,Gerritt,2007-05-25 23:07:00,6129,Hogzilla was PROVEN to be real.. they dug it up! albeit only estimated to be 800lbs judging by Skeletal remains... big enough for me!  they did DNA tests on Hogzilla and was a domestic farm pig and a wild hog cross... some sort of weird mutation ....now could those super hogs be having super piglets?  cant believe the size of it... but kid you not it is real.  Gerritt.

75249,misfish,2007-05-25 23:35:00,29133, What would you know.L M A O  UNREAL.
75252,pigeonfisher,2007-05-25 23:43:00,696,that is one big pig.  I like the play by play...I blasted the pig 8 times then chased him for 3 hours and finished him point blank.  they must be looking forward to the 500-700 lbs of sausage.  I can't imagine what that much sausage would look like.
75255,fishdawg,2007-05-26 00:08:00,912,whadda bout 500-700 lbs of chicken wings steve?  lol
75259,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 00:15:00,8163,"That hog was actually shot in the Anniston area, 20 miles from my house. Nothing unusual about kids hunting with pistols around here, and the Feral Hogs are becoming a nuisance. There's no season or bag limit on them here. They're domesticated hogs that have escaped and turned back wild and sometimes crossbreed with wild hogs. They do alot of crop damage around here... the dang things eat like pigs!!!"
75262,Daplumma,2007-05-26 00:22:00,1961,"I spent a summer going to military police school in Anniston,Alabannannannas in the early 80's.There are some real hogs there for sure !Judy's Oyster boat comes to mind.Nice country though. Joe"
75271,tjsa,2007-05-26 00:38:00,1578," I still do not believe the size of the hog in the picture, but i can relate to shooting off a .50 calibre Casull(sp) handgun. Got a couple of 35mm pictures around here somewheres of me lying prone on the ground just before firing it off, and the next pic is of me,  ""2 feet further back"" after pulling the trigger.  That thing packs a punch,  I did not get the chance to fire off the Desert Eagle my bud had, the ammo did not arrive in time, DANG!!!!!!!"
75277,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 00:52:00,8163,"  We've got some ""good sized"" 11 yr. olds around here... it's the biscuits and gravy yanno!!!"
75310,John Bacon,2007-05-26 02:56:00,3277,"  Are you referring to the hunter or the hunted?  Sorry, I couldn't resist"
75315,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 03:15:00,8163,  Said the man named Bacon?
75337,OhioFisherman,2007-05-26 04:33:00,6623,"I have shot a .50 Desert Eagle, a kid could do it."
75350,Photoz,2007-05-26 08:16:00,792,Musta been one tough pig to take EIGHT hits from a 50 calibre handgun . . . .     musta been one tough kid to fire it NINE times!!
75413,Jen,2007-05-26 16:41:00,833,  mmmm biscuits and gravy!!  That is one amazing animal...wow
75429,gussser,2007-05-26 18:27:00,85,"LOOK at the picture.. If hog is supposed to be 9 feet long- the kid must be 2'6"" tall---just another tall tail.

75562,Joey,2007-05-27 02:39:00,9122,"Mmmmmm, Pork chops and Apple sauce  Joey"
75578,John Bacon,2007-05-27 03:14:00,3277," I am a little perplexed by your statement about the kid being 2'6"" tall.  If you are trying the to estimate the size of the hog by comparing it to the size of the boy; then, the larger the boy the larger the hog and vice versa.  A 9'4"" hog would be 3.6 longer than a 2'6"" person is tall.  The same hogs length would be less than double the height of a five foot tall person (a more reasonable height for an 11 year old).  A hog that mad an 11 year appear to only be 2'6"" by comparison would have to be much larger than 9'4""; not smaller as your post implies."
