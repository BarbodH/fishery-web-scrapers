The fish weren't biting but he did manage to land a good sized pike late in the afternoon. We decided to head out mid-morning on Sunday despite the weather conditions because we figured that was the type of day the fish would be biting and sure enough they were. Although we weren't able to stay out long due to the choppy water and rain, we hooked into three fish, between 3-5 pounds.  All in all, a good weekend.  Looking forward to hitting more lakes further up north on our many planned camping trips.  "
