I am planning to go to the Willow Beach area but have no (and I stress No) idea of what I am doing.  Never done this before.  I have heard a set up consisting of a Meegs? jig, tipped with a minnow just off bottom would work.  Questions are:  Is there a launch near Willow Beach and how early does it open? Can I buy minnows near by? What test line should I use? ANY OTHER TIPS?  Thanks and looking forward to your replies (either on the forum or PM'd   if you'd prefer)."

Anchor somewhere in the area and just drop the lure to the bottom and move yer bait slowing in a vertical postion about 2 inches up and slowly back down.  No need for live bait.  Launching I,ll leave to someone else on that side."

76158,Terry,2007-05-28 17:11:00,14456,Mahoneys  Crates $10  if you boat is low enough to get under the bridge or the East Point Marina in Island Grove $20
