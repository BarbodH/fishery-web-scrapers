75546,charlied,2007-05-27 02:05:00,584,pretty cool..now imagine if spawning salmon did that in the Niagara when one was caught and the all started jumping at a boat!
75553,silveradosheriff,2007-05-27 02:13:00,1025,That is kewl!
75554,ilario,2007-05-27 02:23:00,166,"predators don't have it easy...they often get seriously hurt or killed trying to take down prey... i read a book that researched wolf behaviour (David Meech?) and it when on to explore the amount of injuries wolves recieve when trying to take down moose, musk ox, mountain goats and even white tail deer...lots of broken bones, internal bleeding, and death from hoof kicks and antlers.."
75560,danc,2007-05-27 02:35:00,4677,Africa??? HAH!!! Yeah right. That's the gang at Lakair last June fighting over the last Old Milwackee!!!!
75563,DebS,2007-05-27 02:42:00,56,"Wow, that was unbelievable! It's a wonder any of the young ones survive to adulthood. Thanks for posting that Rick!"
75567,kennyman,2007-05-27 02:54:00,737,"Thanks for posting that. I had the wife and kids come watch it too. One of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Very cool how the lions worked together then the buffalo joined forces to rescue the babe .... and attack lions  !! I had no idea they would do that. Quick recap.Lion sees steak, lion wants steak, lion chases steak, alligator want steak , big steaks save little steak. They live happily ever after."
