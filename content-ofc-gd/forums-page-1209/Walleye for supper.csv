75618,Bernie,2007-05-27 12:18:00,3190,"Went out yesterday evening for a quick fish. drifted for a bit and hooked into one. Just as I was going back to anchor another boat came by and anchored very close to where I wanted to be. Went upwind of him and anchored. First cast hooked into another one. About every second cast was rewarded with a pickerel. None of them in the slot.Weather was fantastic, just a slight breeze frrom the northwest.Forty minutes from the time I left the cottage until I got back with my 4 fish. Fresh pickerel for supper tonite.MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM yum. Sorry no pics, forgot my camera"

75665,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-27 16:04:00,0,Thanks for the report. The pickeral were biting well last evening. Unfortunately so were the Mosquitos!
75673,Bernie,2007-05-27 16:31:00,3190,Thanks for the replys guys. I'll take a pic of them when I eat em up for supper tonite  . I was by myself and really wasnt expecting to catch anything so the camera stayed at the cottage. Just so nice out and I worked hard on the boathouse all day and a fishing break was in order. Guess that a pic of them when I got back would have been possible. Nothing big for the contest so it didnt cross my mind to take any.

Had too many brown pop. I did stop by B.J. Tackle in Bewdley on rice lake and there was a company fishing derby. They weight in 54 walleye by the 2pm deadline. Average size were 4lbs and the largest was around 8.5 lbs."
