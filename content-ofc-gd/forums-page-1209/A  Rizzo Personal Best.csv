76329,Rizzo,2007-05-28 23:57:00,4754,"Johnny B...I smashed that one just for you!  I gotta admit, I was pretty surprised to see that fish surface.  Pickerel, especially big ones, aren't too common up there."
76336,motv8tr,2007-05-29 00:38:00,2587,"Good stuff Rizzo, beats my personal best, and I've fished for them even  .  Maureen"
76378,snag,2007-05-29 02:02:00,1932,"Awesome,  I love suprises!"
76381,fishindevil,2007-05-29 02:09:00,6254,"Congrats on your new PB, walleye.  ....thats a beauty,and a nice big bruiser pike too.....way to go,and on a spoon as well....cheers"
76383,GbayGiant,2007-05-29 02:12:00,1780,"Congrats for releasing the walleye, that's a rare occasion on it's own not many would have, especially a PB.  How the heck did you get it to pose so nicely for you ?   she had her gills and fins flaired out perfectly."
76396,Whopper,2007-05-29 02:34:00,2174,"Good stuff Rizzo, good to see ya out almost thought you gave up the sport  Whopper"
76421,discophish,2007-05-29 04:15:00,392,"Hey Rizzo, I bet that 40 incher is your sheep that jumps over the fence now and for a while before you doze off each night!  Hehe.  Congrats to your pb catch!  She's very fine indeed.  There is a reason a fish makes it to 40 inches, and they behave curiously and cautiously just to let you know that you are on their territory.  Good job!  It sure is exciting to get to new lakes, especially the local ones that you have always wondered about."
76464,OhioFisherman,2007-05-29 12:19:00,6623,"They used to have a guy on the news here named Rizzo that gave the sports reports, I like yours better, he never mentioned fishing! LOL Nice fish! Congrats on the PB!"
75881,Rizzo,2007-05-28 01:39:00,4754,"Finally got the boat out for the first time on Saturday a.m.  The plan was to do some piking so we tried out an inland lake approx 15 minutes south of Parry Sound.  Never fished here before, so it took a bit of time...but not too long...before the first fish was on.  Not what I was looking for, but a nice incidental catch.    This was a 6.5 lb walleye that hit a 5 of diamonds spoon.  Never having been to Quinte, and never deliberately trying to catch a walleye, this was actually a personal best for me!  Fish was released healthy.  Funny thing is, I had just finished telling my partner that I had never caught a bass on a spoon before, but that I had caught walleye on a 5 of diamonds while pike fishing at Lakair.  Couldn't have been more than 2 casts later that this fish was caught.  Nonetheless, we didn't drive up to Parry Sound for incidental walleye catches.  Pike was our targetted prey.  We had a tough time finding even a hammerhandle on this new lake, although just before we were entirely discouraged my partner had a follow from a pike that looked like it had a shovel for a head...an absolute monster. As he quivered at the back of the boat, I caught a glimpse of the fish that appeared to be in the 40 inch range with an absolutely huge melon.  About an hour after finally raising a fish, we managed to land one when I coaxed a 32 inch fish with broad shoulders out from under a boathouse.  This fish had only one eye, but had a big girth so clearly wasn't having problems seeing the dinner menu.  Throughout the day we had some follows of nice pike (mid 30 inches) but they seemed a bit lethargic, just kind of curious.  The out of season smallies were out in full force though, being quite aggressive and hitting some large baits.  Ended the day with this pike, not huge (a little under 30 inches) but a good way to wrap up the day.  Good times out exploring new waters.  "
75888,irishfield,2007-05-28 01:52:00,26272,Thanks for the report Rizzo....one beauty 'eye that is!

76261,bbog,2007-05-28 20:56:00,665,Fantastic report and an incidental Walleye to boot  How were the black flies? I gonna be up in that same area next weekend.
76265,Rizzo,2007-05-28 21:02:00,4754,Black flies weren't too bad.  Fortunately there was a breeze that day and a lot of the black flies are pretty much done now.  The mosquitoes at the launch at 8 a.m were just stupid though.  I brought a bug hat but only needed it at the launch
76269,setomonkey,2007-05-28 21:11:00,872,"Congrats on the PB, very nice 'eye!  Mike"
