75031,Squid,2007-05-25 13:29:00,1656,For a minute there I thought that it was Terry writing the story    I hope it all works out for you Wayne.
75033,tonyb,2007-05-25 13:36:00,1637,"Wow! 61mph!? That's the same configuration I was planning on, that is some serious speed.  Why would you open it up like that if you don't know the water???  Tony"
75035,wuchikubo,2007-05-25 13:37:00,1114,"Wow Wayne, that was a rough start to the boating season for you! But just think, now that all of the bad luck is out of the way you should have a fantasic year of fishing. I believe the good luck is coming to balance off all the cr@p you had to endure!  Good to hear you got into fish! (Or so you say, I'll have to see the pics to give the thumbs up!   )  Don't cause yourself too much grief as it's not good for the health!  Take care,  Stan"
75044,kennyman,2007-05-25 13:49:00,737,"Well, they say bad luck comes in threes. Seems like you and Leah should be done.   I'm sure you'll get the boat figured out. Maybe you should switch careers and start building high end boats instead of planes? I'm sure there would be a market for a fine hand crafted piece of machinery/art for those folk ""too thick in the wallet""."
75051,Tomcat,2007-05-25 14:03:00,395,"Your report was a sad story indeed. Sorry that you and Leah had to endure it. However, on a positive note, I'll be more able to face some difficulties myself after reading about how well you seemed to handle all those misfortunes. And although it's no solace, thanks for sharing about your new Lund. Be sure to let Lund know that there's a heck of a lot of people reading your posts."
75053,camillj,2007-05-25 14:11:00,1988,"  Well, look at the bright side Wayne ... no cigarette burns or kiddy barf  ... sorry to hear about your pains .. but you are sooooo right .. it could always be worse ... be thankful for the good side ... you got your boat ... it catches fish ... even under the 'cloud' .... once the cloud lifts she's gonna be a sweeeeeet purring fishin machine .. I just know it !"
75069,Sherriff,2007-05-25 15:07:00,252,"Wow Wayne, sorry to head but it will only get better from this point on...  Sherriff"
75071,OhioFisherman,2007-05-25 15:16:00,6623,"LOL, thanks Wayne, you got me drinking again! Sorry about your lack of luck? Something has to go right!"
75081,theRJ,2007-05-25 15:36:00,55,"That was quite a trip for you Wayne, just think of it as getting an entire summer's worth of bad luck out of the way at once (maybe 2 summers if it was one of the really nice Canon's) I do hope your next trip goes much better for you.  RJ"
75094,Cast-Away,2007-05-25 16:00:00,790,"Jeez, Wayne, it sounds like a Friday boat from Chrysler back in the 70's! You don't expect to hear that about Lund. I fact, that is the first time that I ever heard a complaint about Lund. I'm with Ron, that your marina, especially if they know you well, should had done a better PDI job. You do after all pay for the service on top of the boat. Just don't paint the boat bright yellow! I hope that everything gets fixed up really quickly for you. I remember the excitment in your posts last winter about getting this new puppy!"
75098,bigbuck,2007-05-25 16:14:00,2449,"You know, I hear stuff like this and I don't feel sorry for the manufacturing sector in North America. People are losing their jobs to places like China, Korea, Taiwan and the like because workers here have been spoiled for too long, great benefits good pay and NO QUALITY CONTROL!!! For God's sake, take pride in what you do! There is some underpriveleged person out there just waiting to scoop your job in a 3rd world country. The workers at LUND should be ashamed of themselves. Wayne, you bought a $75k boat + options and taxes and it looks like it was put together by a blind monkey (no offence to our furry cousins)........that is freakin' emabarrasing. LUND had definitely better bend over backwards to address all of THEIR issues i)at no cost to you, and ii)give you a loaner boat in the meantime. Your marina should not be on the hook for this FOR THE MOST PART. They should have noticed some of the problems when they did their PDI. Come on, crooked guages!!! Wayne, I feel for you. You must have had just an awesome trip, glasses, camera in the drink.......at least you caught some fish. Good luck with getting the boat fixed up to spec."
75105,Bernie,2007-05-25 16:38:00,3190,Geez Wayne. That all really sucks. Feel bad for you. Im sure the company's involved will make things right for you. Glad the odometer didnt turn until after you visited with me  . Did the pike hit one of the jigs I gave to you?
75113,solopaddler,2007-05-25 16:48:00,8605,"Murphy's law strikes again! Remember Wayne, what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger!"
75117,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-25 16:50:00,1183,"I too am sorry to hear of the let ""downs""---but you do have a way of making some of it quite humurous.  That's it now for the bad luck - all good from here on."
75119,irishfield,2007-05-25 16:51:00,26272,"Lost both of your jigs to ROCK bass Bernie. I know where they are as well and will retrieve when the water's warmer!  Thanks everyone for your sympathy posts...all in all it's not that bad...it just could have went a whole lot better. All will be fixed and made right, that I know or I'll be driving the Limited Edition 2025 Pro-V around the lake for the summer. (that's already been offered for the interm)  Now out to the shop to figure out how to get these Pursuit tracks lashed down to the gunnels..."
75123,glen,2007-05-25 16:54:00,2641,"""Maybe I'm a tad pickier than some""  No way.  When it is new it should be perfect.  I hope they get there stuff together and fix it properly."
75168,Daplumma,2007-05-25 18:53:00,1961,"Geez Wayne,I would be going thru that boat with a fine tooth comb looking for the Bannanna that some one stashed in it!Best of luck with the issues. Joe"
75225,motv8tr,2007-05-25 22:23:00,2587,  I swear it wasn't me  Maureen
75308,MuskyBill,2007-05-26 02:49:00,311,"Wow, Wayne, that's a tough one to read....sorry to hear."
75313,fishindevil,2007-05-26 03:06:00,6254,"wow....sorry to hear all that wayne,thats some awefull bad luck to happen to you,and you dont deserve this thats for sure,i hope everything works out for ya, try to keep cool.....make sure they know how mad you are,and all your hard earned money is at steak,they will get the drift real quick"
75314,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 03:10:00,8163,"  I've heard THAT one before!!!    BTW... Wayne, whatcha gonna do when your hour meter rolls over to 666 on the boat???"
75319,irishfield,2007-05-26 03:20:00,26272,Smash the Merc Smart craft gauge a few hours before....or have you in the boat when it rolls over Bud !  Drilling 40 holes in the barstard made me feel a bit better this afternoon.....
75442,musky_man,2007-05-26 19:42:00,159,"Wayne,  Very disturbing when you spend that type of money and get that type of workmanship -- Lund should be making good and then some -- let us know how you make out.  In the end though, how many people would dig like you have to see how they are really put together -- precious few .... so I suspect Lund will only make good on those who do the digging.  Stuff like this really ticks me --even when you spend top buck for the best, there is no guarantee you are getting it ... I know in the end they will do right by you, but why the hell should you even have to go through the aggravation.  Take care,  - Mark"
76046,Whopper,2007-05-28 13:30:00,2174,Damit man after reading this episode I think I'm going to start drinking.  Hope thing work out for ya Wayne  Whopper
76070,Dano,2007-05-28 14:22:00,719,"Sorry to hear about your grief Wayne, you should have come with us, you would have had just as bad a time. Looked for your boat at the dock when we stopped for fuel in Temagami, but didnt see it so we carried on. Breakfast with you would have been the best part of our trip....."
75015,irishfield,2007-05-25 12:58:00,26272,"Thanks everyone! Yes everything will be fine, when all is said and done. Just not the way you envision things to go after waiting since November to let 'er rip and if you talk to Leah you'll find I wasn't a great companion to be around for the last 10 days! Good thing we'll be spending June 8th 'till fall a mile from the Marina...so they can install the replacement items as they come in from Lund. Think we'll just pre-plan for Tuesday am service visits each week. Marina owner isn't at all happy with Lund either. At his expense he's had to replace the solid pedestals under the captains chairs with Air units as that's what I have on my invoice and Lund didn't install them saying he ordered wrong. He's also out a pair of trim switches for the bow, the time to install them and 50 hours of PDI work that he'd figured 8 should have covered... if Lund had done the pre-package fully like was supposed to happen.  The Lund rep already left me a pair of Lund PDF's for the letter I wrote the VP of Lund back in the winter...ie their dealer non-participation in quoting my boat. Maybe after all this Bull....when I get back to the lake I'll find an SS Classic for a tender waiting for me I arrive."
75022,tonyb,2007-05-25 13:12:00,1637,"Wow! Now that is a trip to look back on one day and just shake your head and laugh.  I wouldn't say you are picky at all Wayne.  You bought a Lund because of what they are supposed to be, quality and a tradition of solid workmanship.  I hope that they aren't getting complacent these days, relying on their reputation to carry them, that only works for a very short amount of time before word gets out.  I trust they will do everything to correct the problems, but that's not the point, you paid to have it perfect from the time you took delivery.  I think it is completely unacceptable that they could deliver your boat in that state, where is quality control?  Maybe they are the ones drinking? Tony"
75026,irishfield,2007-05-25 13:19:00,26272,Quite possible Tony..ie drinking.  They shot themselves in the foot closing the Manitoba plant. They don't have enough capacity now. You can't order a 2007 boat to your specs...you can only buy what's on the dealer floors/pre-orders now.  Speaking of which...if you still want that serial #1- 2025 Limited Edition I've already crawled thru it somewhat. Can complete the PDI for you in a couple weeks! LOL
75027,Joey,2007-05-25 13:19:00,9122,"Well Holy Crap, I can see why you didn't post your report right away.  I'm glad you didn't succumb to your drinking urge, because we all know, that never solves anything.  It can only go uphill from here Wayne, AND you caught fish  Thanks for the report!  Joey"
75028,irishfield,2007-05-25 13:23:00,26272,"Yep..we caught fish. The boat is good luck in that regard. Hopefully we'll have it all straightened out before Lakair.  Could have been worse believe it or not...  The Temagami Marine Fishing ""Pro"" dropped his new 2007 - 1900 Pro-V in the water right behind us on Wednesday. With a total of 0.3 hours on it and it's 225 Optimax he shoaled it doing 61 MPH. Sheared about 75 rivet heads off the bottom and made the lower units bullet look like a peeled banana!"
