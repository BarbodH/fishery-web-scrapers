75569,007,2007-05-27 03:00:00,537,"Well done guys!  Looks like you hooked into some nice carp there. I like the head on shot!  I failed in my quest to hook a GTA carp today - though I saw plenty of them and saw what must have been a fish of 30+lbs swim past my bait near Hanlans Point at the Islands.  Tried worms instead of corn but all I could hook into was the odd OOS largie, so called it a day.  Keep those reports coming UrbanAngler and Dsn. 007"

75607,dsn,2007-05-27 11:12:00,1018,"We were being stalked by two other fishermen out there. We were pulling carp out like theres no tomorrow. While these two other guys were getting skunked. Urbanangler pulled out 6 fish from the same spot and these guys were watching. One even pretend to see if he could see any fish and came over and stood beside us and never said even ""hi"". He wantted to see what we were using. Then he goes back to his buddy. Later on when things slowed down Urbanangler and I decided to target bigger fish so we left out spot. Went for a walk. One of the stalkers yelled out... ""Where did they go?""  We heard them.  After walking for a bit we went back to reclaim our spot. Things slowed down even more. Then we decided to try one of urbananglers locals. Nothing happened there.  So we decided to head back to where we started from. Sure enough those guys took our position. We saw them and decided to try out a secondary spot. We could see them and they could see us across from the lake. They had no action at all. As for urbanangler and I we got into fish again directly infront of those guys who took our chummed spot. This time urbanangler gets a serious hit. It was the biggest carp of the day. Also cleared his spool of line almost. Then seconds later after I help him land his fish.. I get a monster on. And urbanangler helps land my fish.  And all this was happening right is front the those two guys who took our chummed location. Boy did we make them look bad  . The fish were following us that day. A friend of mine went over and tried to talk to them but he came back and said they were too friendly.  That'll teach them for not being friendly.  dsn"
75662,RobHall,2007-05-27 15:49:00,261," Nice Carp UA.  Thanks for sharing.  Did you happen to take a measurement of that Carp with the OFNCommunity.com sign?  It's over 30""...but how much over?  FOTB "
75667,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-27 16:06:00,0,Gotta love carp! The first Sportfish I ever got into. Lotta power!
75689,Mike the Pike,2007-05-27 17:43:00,3421,Good for you URBY.Nice pics great to hear how the fish almost spooled you that means it was great battle.  Looking forward to the next outing and report  MTP
75693,urbanangler1990,2007-05-27 17:50:00,933, you know what we actually didnt measure   at least i got the sign in there
75818,RobHall,2007-05-28 00:17:00,261," Hi UA,  It looks to be about 30""...so i will put it down for 30"" on the leader board for Team 10.  I believe you are with Team 10.  It also qualifies for the 2 bonus inches.  Submit the pic with the ""ofncommuniy.com sign to OFAH.  Then provide the link to me and i we add an extra 2 inches to team 10's total.  FOTB "
