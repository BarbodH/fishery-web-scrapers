75089,fishindevil,2007-05-25 15:47:00,6254,"Well we got to the ottawa river around 5am sat morning and the weather conditions were amazing,so off i went to catch some walleyes,and i did,most were all around the 15-20 inch range,and were very hard to catch,as there was some kind of mayfly hatch going on and the fishing had been very slow for the last week,i managed to catch most of my fish running a worm harness setup,on a 3-way rig,just trolling the drop-offs,and they were really lite biting and i lost alot of fish till i put on a stinger hook,once i had them figured out i managed to do pretty well,and even nailed a few nice sized pike,with the biggest around maybe 9lbs,its kinda tough taking pics by yourself,so i did the best i could,i also took some pics of the walleyes in my livewell,so the rest of thew weekend went pretty much the same with my count of about 30 walleyes and kept enough for a great fish-fry,and man are they tasty....so enjoy the scenery   sorry everyone i tried to get my pics up but i have forgotten and i will try again,it ruined my post.....

75090,ccmtcanada,2007-05-25 15:51:00,7971,Hey Shawn...sounded like a great time out there!! Congrats on all the eyes and nice pike.  I clicked on your photobucket link...I only get one pic....would love to see the rest.  Alone in your boat?  Should have called me...although the Ottawa river is a bit far from me...LOL  Take care Cliff
75092,easton13th,2007-05-25 15:56:00,371,Sound like a great time. I can not view any photos though. Would love to see them.  Easton
75136,Joey,2007-05-25 17:16:00,9122,"Yep, no photo's here either  I'd like to see them if you can get them to work.  Joey"
75140,Badger Shark,2007-05-25 17:22:00,291,"I gotta say its nice to have the Ottawa right in my backyard.  I love fishing on it.  My favorite spot is Constance bay, there is everything in there this time of year before the water heats up.  Big pike, musky, smallies, largies, eyes and big cats, and of course annoying panfish!   Anywhere on the river you can catch fish.  Man thats a long haul to drive.  And I dont see your pics either, but I sympathize as I am still trying to learn the whole upload deal."
75251,Mike the Pike,2007-05-25 23:39:00,3421,Well Shawn I was wondering where you have been.Good to hear you did very well but please hurry up and get us those PICS  Hurry up and break that boat in  WTG we are waitingggggggggg FD  MTP
75253,solopaddler,2007-05-25 23:47:00,8605,"Nice report! It's funny you mentioned the mayflies, 'cause every fish I cleaned last weekend was stuffed full of the nymphs. That's bizarre to me as the hex hatch doesn't normally occur 'till mid to late June up there. And it's not like we've had an overly warm or early spring.... Just goes to show that nature is unpredictable."
75281,irishfield,2007-05-26 00:57:00,26272,Mayflies flying around in Temagami as well the last week or so.  Good to hear from you Shawn...and where are the pictures!?!?
