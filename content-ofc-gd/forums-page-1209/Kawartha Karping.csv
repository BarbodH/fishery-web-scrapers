76299,Photoz,2007-05-28 22:51:00,792,"Well, after yet ANNUDER supreme skunking yesterday, I was a bit apprehensive about getting outta bed at 03:00 and driving well over an hour to just get skunked again!! 'ell, I could stay at home and get skunked fishing my bathtub . . .      without paying $30.00+ for gas! But bein' a real masochist & hawg for punishment, (aren't ALL anglers?)  I dragged my poor tired old butt down to my van just before 05:00, and arrived at Lake 'X' about 06:30 . . .    saw about 4 carp jump as I was setting up. Tossed in about 06:45, walked up to my van, only to hear BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!! I made a run for the rod, fish gone. Not a wiggle for about a half hour . . .    strange? I haul in . . .    corn pulled off hair rig . .    bait up again . .     this time within 5 minutes, had one on . .     got 'im stopped . . .    a few head shakes, he throws the barbless hook! This goes on till 09:30, when I landed my biggest one of the day . .     a scrawney looking 30"" that only weighed about 15 pounds. Got another 2, slightly smaller a few minutes later, then back to numerous line bumps until about noon. I moved down the shore about 100', not a sniff for over 3 hours, then between 3:00 & 4:00, missed 2, landed 4 more. Well worth the drive, 7 fish, but average size was only about 13 pounds . . .    but they did fight well. Matter of fact, I enjoyed myself so much, I'm going back tomorrow. This is the scrawney 30 incher I got first, and they got smaller. Geeze . . ..  doesn't anybody feed these poor creatures? I gave 'em at least 10 pounds of corn & groundbait today to fatten 'em up!!

76358,lazybum,2007-05-29 01:34:00,142,You're building up momentum now.   The next outing will get even better.  I didn't land any this season until last Sunday and that one day made up for three weeks of zeroes.
