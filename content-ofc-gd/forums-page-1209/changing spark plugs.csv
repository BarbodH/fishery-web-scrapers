76026,Terry,2007-05-28 12:55:00,14456,well you can clean the area around the plug while the plug is still screwed in but I wouldn't clean when the plug is out the threads should be fine and you risk getting dirt and whatnot in the cylinder and that's a bad thing
76031,misfish,2007-05-28 13:04:00,29133,Make sure the area is clean.You can put a drop or two of 3 in 1 oil.I wouldnt use a spray.
76036,boatman,2007-05-28 13:13:00,350,"If its really bad, I will spray the area (with the plugs in) with WD40 or something to loosen the oil and dirt. Then I blow it out with compressed air. Sometimes you need to do a little scrubbing with a toothbrush."
76053,misfish,2007-05-28 13:44:00,29133,"Watch using that WD 40 stuff. Keep it off the wires and boots of the plugs. That is nasty stuff on rubber after time,and is very explosive.  Seen it happen,not pretty."

76210,misfish,2007-05-28 18:53:00,29133," Hey douG,how about that blue lock tite.   What ever way you do it,just make sure you get NOTHING in the cylinders."
