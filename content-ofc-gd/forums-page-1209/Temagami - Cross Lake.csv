75907,co-pilot,2007-05-28 02:31:00,1,This will be our 8th year heading up to South Temagami and Cross Lake areas (June 1-8) We found a few hit and miss spots but have no idea where we are going in Cross Lake. Does anyone have any input on generally where to go in Cross Lake once we enter via the narrows from Lake Temagami? (I did nail a 5 lb OSS bass last year off a big sheet of rock in one channel - but nothing else.)  Thanks

There's so much water up there all you can do is work it like everyone else. I've got two full summer under my belt..spending 16+ weeks a year on the lake and haven't found a good ""spot"" yet.  And welcome to the board. Be sure to post a nice picture filled thread when you return."
