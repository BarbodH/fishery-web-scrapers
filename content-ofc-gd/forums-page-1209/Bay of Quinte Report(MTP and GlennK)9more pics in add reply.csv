75539,fishindevil,2007-05-27 01:45:00,6254,"Great report & pics mike,WOW.  ...that sure was an awesome fishing trip,man you guys caught some real nice walleyes,and some very impressive pike as well,it sure is nice when walleyes are on the menu all weekend long.....thanks for sharing your adventure with us,.....cheers"
75972,nelly,2007-05-28 07:44:00,256,"That was some amazing report and pics there MTP. Never have fish for walleye on soft water in the BOQ, must give it a shot one day. Mike, is the walleye fishing that much better in Ontario than Quebec?"
75999,Mike the Pike,2007-05-28 12:00:00,3421,  No the Walleye fishing is just as good here in Quebec after a few cold and snowy May 24 weekends up North in the Mont-Laurier region we changed locations.Its warmer in the BOQ May long weekend no bugs no black flies no endless hills to climb 401 cruise control all the way.  I catch Walleyes regularly on the St.Lawrence there is excellent walleye fishing in Northern Quebec but its a long drive  6hrs is too long for a weekend.There is something I like about the BOQ very easy to navigate a boat.  No where else can you catch many Trophy Walleyes in the Fall as the BOQ More than 3 double digits in one day is not uncommon.  Mike
74487,b2kptbo,2007-05-23 23:04:00,1505,"That a good fishin trip, thanks for the pic's..."
74491,huntervasili,2007-05-23 23:08:00,1604,Great report Mike... Glad to see ya didn't drive all the way there for nothing... looks like you caught a bunch of fish and had a great fry after too... I caught a couple of those white bass or perch when I was out for walleye this past weekend too... they are full of eggs or at least the ones I saw were... thanks for sharing the report with us  Bill
74504,tjsa,2007-05-23 23:33:00,1578,"NICE MIKE, what else is there to say, other than FANTASTIC report."
74518,Roy,2007-05-23 23:59:00,13728,I still say that that's a white bass. Probably interbred with a white perch (which is also a bass).
74540,Greencoachdog,2007-05-24 00:41:00,8163," White Bass and White perch are both Temperate Bass, White Perch however occur in waters with a higher saline content. White Bass cannot tolerate high saline levels.  Since Mikes fish was caught in a ""Fresh"" water body, it is a White Bass."
74547,Daplumma,2007-05-24 00:54:00,1961,"White bass,white perch..looks good to me,rolled in corn meal and fried up crisp!Great report. Joe"
74563,fishdawg,2007-05-24 01:48:00,912,Tonys right its a white perch for sure  - just as tasty as a yellow though  nice outing guys - gotta love Quinte - one of my fave spots to wet a line for sure
74567,Clampet,2007-05-24 01:58:00,1947,"Grrrreat Report. Nice Fish, nice boat. Nice weather, good friends. Great looking food.  Good stuff, like the fact you got some nice table fare Walleye! "
74570,007,2007-05-24 02:06:00,537,Mike the Pike - Great report.  Thanks for sharing so many photos.  Tony B - out of interest where did you get the info/drawings of the fish species? - I'm always looking for good sources of info for the different fish species in Ontario.  Cheers 007
74573,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-24 02:17:00,191,Great report and who is the guy in the black and red coat with the sunglasses I believe his mother is in the nursing home that I work in her name is Jean Andrews. Pretty sure he was in to the home the other day too. Cheers.
74582,postman,2007-05-24 03:05:00,12,"Great report. I thought the mystery fish was a white bass. The white perch from kansas don't get that big. If you remembered when cleaning the fish, white bass tend to have the red meat and white perch is more like crappie or walleye having white meat. Thanks for sharing!"
74583,Tomcat,2007-05-24 03:08:00,395,Great report and pictures - made me feel like I was on the trip too. Thanks for sharing.  One question - would you mind providing some details about your boat and motors please. Nice looking rig!
74598,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-24 07:01:00,2585,great report with great pics!
74623,Mike the Pike,2007-05-24 12:10:00,3421, Blackfish the guy your talking about his name is James he came fishing with us for the day he was staying in Belleville and his mom is in a nursing home.James came to visit us on his motorcycle did you see him with a helmut?  Small world.Mike the Pike
74624,Mike the Pike,2007-05-24 12:12:00,3421, No the fish(white bass) went back into the big Pond I just like the taste of perch and Walleye.
74626,Mike the Pike,2007-05-24 12:18:00,3421," Tom my boat is a Lund SSV 18.5ft long with a 50hp Honda 4 stroke with power trim and flat floor inserts my kicker motor is a 2 stroke Yamaha 8hp I connect both motors with a steering bar when trolling ,I troll with the 8hp and steer with the 50hp.It is a very stable boat. Coming back from Hay Bay on the weekend there were 3 foot swells I had it going full throttler trimmed up and over the waves she rides like a cadillac.I like my big tinny."
74655,tonyb,2007-05-24 13:51:00,1637,"You guys are funny, fish species identification has nothing to do with saltwater vs freshwater (That's like saying there are no sharks in freshwater!!!) or colour of flesh (which is actually determined by the fish's diet).  Sharks in freshwater... http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/20...bullsharks.html   Tony"
74684,ehg,2007-05-24 15:52:00,2666,"Awesome report Mike the Pike! Like the boat pics as well as the fish pictures. That Ungava is a cool lil' boat.  By the way i've caught hundreds of White Bass, which that fish isn't! It is a White Perch as TonyB points out. Has no stripes, a greenish hue and perch like face. A rarish sight here.  Great report,  ehg"

74999,Smokey,2007-05-25 12:30:00,1278,Great looking fish. Congrats on a successful weekend.  Maybe a heads up to your friend Glenn.  It is against the law to tow more than one trailer behind your vehicle unless using a commercial vehicle. A quote form the Ontario MTO site.  I'm not sure if his van is commercial or not so just mentioning it cause I actually saw him on the road and couldn't belive it as you barely ever see it in Ontario. Some provinces and states do allow it.
75018,Mike the Pike,2007-05-25 13:09:00,3421, Thanks for the concern Smokey Glenn did his ontario Homework though if you have commercial plates in Ontario it is Legal.I have seen many fifth wheel trailers with boats behind them in Ontario.Remember Glenn had Quebec plates so were not sure the law would apply to us .The law in Quebec is a limit of 63ft long.But really that boat adds little weight to his maximum tow.  Thanks for the heads up .Mike
75024,irishfield,2007-05-25 13:15:00,26272,GREAT report Mike! and what Smokey said. First trailer has to be a 5th wheel. Can't be tongue to tongue.
75058,hydro,2007-05-25 14:21:00,24,Hey those are some nice 'eyes!  Great job....that is a Northern not a hybrid.  I agree its a white perch - there are no lines running the lentgh of the body.  Nice fish!
74353,tonyb,2007-05-23 14:13:00,1637,"Nice report, looks like you guys had a great time fishing and EATING!  The mystery fish is actually a White Perch  Here is a technical comparison:  White Bass    COMMON NAMES: White bass, Silver bass  SCIENTIFIC NAME: Morone chrysops  IDENTIFICATION: White bass are silvery in color and have a milky white belly. In addition, they have six or more dark lateral lines on the sides and back. This fish has two dorsal fins with the first having nine spines. The white bass closely resembles the hybrid striped bass and the white perch.  White Perch (Your mystery fish)    COMMON NAMES: White perch, Silver perch, Gray perch, Blue nose perch  SCIENTIFIC NAME: Morone americana  IDENTIFICATION: The white perch is a deep bodied fish that looks very similar to the white bass. The main difference is that the white perch is all silver and does not have dark lines running the length of the body.  Hope that helps! I know it's nice to know what you have caught  That other fish that you were wondering if it was a hybrid or not, it is not, it is just a nicely coloured Northern Pike. Tony"
