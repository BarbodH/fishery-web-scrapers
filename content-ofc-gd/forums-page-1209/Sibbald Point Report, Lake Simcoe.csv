Fishing was slow and my partner and I did not catch any.   The winds and rain picked up around 1:30 and we decided to call it a day.   We only saw a couple of whities landed by the other boats during our time on the water.  Most of the fish that were caught by the the other boats were taken on a half gold and half silver Williams.   We fished with Williams and Meegs jigs with no success.  Also while we were the there, the York Region Police boat was out checking licenses and safety equipment.  Nice to see them doing their job.  Bill"
