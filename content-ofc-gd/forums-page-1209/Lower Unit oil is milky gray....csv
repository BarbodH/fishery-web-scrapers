76033,boatman,2007-05-28 13:09:00,350,"I'd run it a couple times before I committed to changing the lower unit seals. The source of water was probably because you didn't have a washer on the drain screw. You might still have a bad seal or two, but I'd test it first. Also, you should run the motor on a boat. You want the gearcase to heat up. It might not fail in the barrel, when it will on the lake.  You don't need to fog the engine or anything. That is for storage. Just run it for the season. Also, it couldn't hurt to change the impeller since you don't know the service history of this motor. Nothing wrong with old motors. I don't have a motor newer than 1988 and I have lots of them."
76227,ilario,2007-05-28 19:42:00,166,"Well, I ran it in the bucket for a good 25 minutes or more after I put on new washers... mostly neutral but I kicked it into gear (F and R) a couple of times.. couldn't do much more than that because the bucket wasn't big ennough.  Afterward, i drained the gear oil again. Hard to say for sure, but it did seem a little opaque...just a touch off and not as clear as when I poured it in. However, this could be b/c of the crap that was alreay in the gear case. I also think that I'm being a bit paranoid at this point!  I hope that I won't harm it by running it in the lake for a a trip or two then checking it to see if there really is water coming in.  BTW, how much does an impellar cost? I am already over budget...but if I have to... can it be readily installed or do I have to dish out more $$ for a mechanic?  thanks!!"
76246,boatman,2007-05-28 20:29:00,350,"I don't know about Honda parts, but OMC and Mercury impellers for an engine that size are $20+. If you have a manual it should be an easy replacement. The oil could be alittle opaque because of air bubbles. Check the oil after each outing for a while. I bet it'll be fine."
76273,fishboy,2007-05-28 21:17:00,550,"You said the engine oil was quite dirty and that it being a small motor there's no filter.  That being the case, you might want to consider changing the engine oil part-way through your first season to have a look.  Hopefully it's much cleaner and it won't even cost you $10.  Taking care of the oil is the simplest way to a long, happy life with any motor."
76344,Fisherman,2007-05-29 01:11:00,7201,"The engine oil fill does not go through the dipstick hole, there's a fill cap there about the same size as used on lawnmowers.   I replaced the impeller on a 7.5, not hard to do, it's the same as a 10HP, undo the bolts underneath the cavitation plate, pull the cotter pin out of the linkage for the shifter at the motor end, takes a bit of looking to find it. You should be able to pull the whole lower unit down.  If I remember, there's 2 bolts that hold the impeller cover on.  Cost was about $17."
76387,ilario,2007-05-29 02:17:00,166,"  thanks...i will look into impeller... as for the oil port, I think we're talking about the same thing! I called it the diupstick because it doubles as both...the cap is yellow and the same size as what you described...a lawnmower!   thanks...hopefully, I won;t need to replace the impeller... just changing the oil and plugs was a huge leap forward for this mechanical idiot!!! but i'm feeling a lot more comfortable now in terms of working on the engine...should save me some $$$$ in the future...  thank you to all memebers!"
75722,boatman,2007-05-27 20:06:00,350,"You know what they say about opinions...lol. There is always descrepency. When it comes to my outboards I always error on the side of caution.  If you don't grease the prop shaft it can corrode and become one with the prop. You will be very upset if this happens and you need to change the prop. You may even find that the prop is fused so badly that replacing the prop also means replacing the prop shaft $$$.  The gear case is designed to run with the constant backpressure of the prop. Without it, you run the risk of gear case run-away where the gears spin too fast and fail. I'm not saying that running a motor in a barrel without a prop will result in failure, but it increases the risk of it.  Water in the gearcase is a problem. It can be very serious. Its a problem I would fix immediately. However, you don't yet know where or why it is leaking. The most common source of water in the gearcase is due to bad seals at the oil changing screws. These seals are either o-rings or washers. They are too be replaced EVERYTIME you change the oil. Few people actually do. That's why I suggest replacing them and then running the motor a few times and checking the oil afterwards. Since you don't have any free water in the gearcase so your leak is very minor. Therefore, you have little risk of failure as long as you are diligent in checking the oil. If you find water is still getting in then replace the seals. That is what I would do, but its just an opinion. I'm not a marine tech. Just an enthusiast."
75746,misfish,2007-05-27 21:16:00,29133,"Grease the shaft as like said by BM, it will become as one,or if anything hard to get off,plus it will work it,s way into the bearing some what and it,s all good.. As for the bottom end thing.I went 5 years with my 78 Johnson doing like I said,just changing the oil. If you want to be at ease,get it looked at and fxed.  It,s only a little water in some oil.It,s not like your running a 250 or something. JMHO."
75816,ilario,2007-05-28 00:13:00,166,"i will definitely replace the seals (washers..) in fact, one of the screws didn;t even have a seal! I don;t remember which scew it was as it came out quicly when I loosened it and the oil oil came rusing out   as for the 'oil filter', apparently, i t doesn;t have one! Is this possible? I went on the i-Boats forum and posted in the Honda section. The one response thus far stated that the motor doesn't have a oil filter, per se.  So, I've done everything else, and I will buy the seals tomorrow. I will start it up tonight to see how it runs.  thanks again..everyone has been very helful here"
75946,boatman,2007-05-28 03:50:00,350,"I wouldn't know about oil filters. I've never worked on a 4 stroke outboard.  The missing o-ring is likely the cause of water coming in. However, you say the oil came rushing out. Is that because you opened the top (vent) screw first and then the lower (fill) screw? You will find it easier and less messy to remove the bottom screw first and re-install it last. If you found that the oil came rushing out after only removing the bottom screw then you have a really bad seal somewhere in the lower unit. The oil should come out very slowly until you open the top vent screw."
76003,ilario,2007-05-28 12:14:00,166,"  i did remove the top one first, as I recall... but that wasn;t where it came spewing out. It was the engine oil on the other side where there is only the one screw. The engine oil on the 4 strokes is poured in from the dipstick and there;s the one drain screw... it came out really quick, which surprised me. It waqs as dirty as I've seen oil. Very dark brown, gritty, and very unclear. I'm assuming the former owner did not change it the past couple of years. Ypu;re all probably thinking why I bought it. I got it for a good price and it actually runs well in the tank. Starts first crank. I'm not sure if this means it will actualy perform well in real world conditions (i.e. on a lake!) but I took a chance. Motot looks good, otherwise.  I will be buying those screws/washers today. Then I will run it in the tank with the prop on(!) for 20 minutes then and I'll check the lower unit oil after doing this. Worse case, I have to get the leak checked into... i still think it was a good deal!  thanks!"
76004,ilario,2007-05-28 12:16:00,166,"Oh, one more thing; I put in the new plugs yesterday. I cleaned out the plug holes as best I could with a towel as they were dirty. Should I have sprayed something into them, like a fogging spary? Can I still do so?  thanks"
76008,Fisherman,2007-05-28 12:19:00,7201,"I'm suspecting by the motor colour,(blue leg) that it may be a 7.5 or 10HP?, then no, it doesn't have an oil filter.  If it was my motor, I would seriously take a look at the upper seal by the water pump impeller and the seal behind the prop, thats another place for the water to get into the lower unit.  Is it worth the hassle, like they say, you pay now for a couple of gaskets, or later for a set of gears. Your choice."
76012,ilario,2007-05-28 12:24:00,166,"  Yes, it's a 10 HP. I will try to locate these seals... Should I just replace them now before running it? Maybe I should just run it in a lake for a few outing s then see if the gear oil holds up...'  thanks!"
