189598,bassfighter,2008-04-19 20:06:00,366,"I met an angler and he told me that Salmon comes into some river system or at least close to shore casting distance during spring time. I than ask another experience salmon angler about it as well and so far it was our first time hearing this. The fellow seemed to be serious and stated he has 20 years experience fishing the area, and caught Salmon, aside from trout.  Can someone elaborate on this ? True or a Myth?"
189601,jonnybass,2008-04-19 20:14:00,346,False as far as I know. He may have been thinking about Browns.
189614,Woodsman,2008-04-19 21:01:00,1286,In past years I've caught  small coho at the mouth at Bayfield in the spring.  Best Wishes: Rick

189616,Marko,2008-04-19 21:04:00,854,I havent heard of Salmon comming up to rivers in the spring. I know trout comes to spawn in the spring and salmon in the fall.
189644,Fang,2008-04-19 22:39:00,1330,Around most of the major tribs you can catch silvers (smaller salmon) in the spring casting spoons and body baits. I've been poking around Bronte as it's only 10 minutes from home and there's a few guys down there but not much catching right now. Last year I got into a coupe nice 4-5 lb chinook and 1 coho casting off the breakwall  We used to hook into the odd laker up on the flats on the credit in the spring but never seen a salmon past the rivermouth area
189773,danc,2008-04-20 02:19:00,4677,"The Nipigon River gets a small spring run of Chinooks. I see them every year in May and June in their half decomposed state, much like they look in the fall after spawning."
189775,Spiel,2008-04-20 02:29:00,9065,....Salmon and trout can be found near shore in the spring and not just rivermouths. It's bait there after and if water temps are right the bait move into spawn and the salmon and trout are right with them.
189783,niagara jeep,2008-04-20 03:11:00,20,Every few years I come across a chinny spawning in the spring!  Very odd but it does happen.   The majority of them I have seen have been on Huron tribs.
189849,Woodsman,2008-04-20 10:23:00,1286,The small coho (2-2 1/2 lbs.) I was referring to seem to be following the trout in to feed on their spawn.
189871,fish_finder,2008-04-20 12:20:00,370,"The smaller jacks definitely make it within casting distance of shore.  Warm water discharge from energy plants and such are also good areas to try.  It would be pointless to target them in the rivers as any that make it in there are probably pretty confused.....and there won't be many.  But.......breakwalls, estuaries and the like are great places for another couple of weeks to try for some Jacks......I like to toss fry flies out for them.......match the hatch if ya catch my drift!!"
189988,bassfighter,2008-04-20 19:26:00,366,"In conclusion, on odd cases some salmon do hang around close to the river mouth duirng spring time but will not enter into the river system, they are seen castable distance from shoreline,  the reason of being there was not preparing to spawn but to eat smaller fish that might be spawning outside the river.  Thanks"
190092,Scott S,2008-04-21 00:06:00,203,Have caught a few nice salmon in the spring time casting big spoon's like little cleo's and william's wobblers off the end of piers on lake huron!! Scooter
190094,danc,2008-04-21 00:19:00,4677, The Chinooks that I'm seeing are definitely spring spawners.
190098,Rizzo,2008-04-21 00:26:00,4754, you might call that a fishing oxymoron  :D
190132,fish_finder,2008-04-21 01:49:00,370,  I've defintely heard of this before in a fly fishing mag sometime........I'm gonna have to find that one!!
