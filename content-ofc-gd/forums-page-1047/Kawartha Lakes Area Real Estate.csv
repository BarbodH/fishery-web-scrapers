Things are finally starting to slow down again, so hopefully I'll find more time to post again. I've managed a big (but wonderfully good) career change recently and we're looking to move up to the Kawartha Lakes area. I am wondering if anyone can suggest a real estate agent in the area that they can personally vouch for. We are hoping for something within a 30 minute commute from Lindsay, hopefully waterfront!!!  Thanks! Snady"
