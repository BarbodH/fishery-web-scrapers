189808,Wendel,2008-04-20 04:40:00,213,"I'd pick George to KO Chuck Norris I just watched the fight of GSP and Matt Serra, wow... he was so focused."
189809,BillM,2008-04-20 04:41:00,17367,That fight defines the work domination.
189838,Gerritt,2008-04-20 06:50:00,6129,a great card tonight... wow... talk about bloody!.... I feel for the guy from BC though.. what a wimp.... I have NEVER seen anyone backpeddle as much.... even the announcers mentioned I am not too sure what his strategy is here... LOL I was howling..   I would still take Lew vs. Chuck Norris though.... my thinking is a fist would smash you from his Moustache before you stood up!  G
189895,BillM,2008-04-20 13:24:00,17367,I enjoyed the kid who fought from WoodBridge..  He took a beating but kept on coming for more.
189955,bullybass,2008-04-20 16:47:00,144,Ya that Woodbridge kid was beaten like a redheaded stepchild!!! ... but it was unreal he didn't give up after those knees to the face!!! real testament to Canadian toughness!!
189984,danbouck,2008-04-20 18:58:00,4380,I agree GSP is a great fighter but Chuck Norris? Come on now do we have to bring back the old Chuck Norris thread
189987,Gerritt,2008-04-20 19:23:00,6129,"Funniest fight I have ever seen..... even the ref stated... Iam not sure what his strategy is here!

190027,Terry,2008-04-20 21:11:00,14456,it was the saddest fight I have seen in a long time
190062,forrest,2008-04-20 23:04:00,1032,"What was up with that guy running away?  Now that I remember that guy had a history of flinching, giving up or just plain being a wussy (as far as UFC goes).  How that guy keeps making it on the main events is beyond me.  Did I miss something?  Was the guy hurt or rigged with some sort of nuclear device that would blow if he got hit?  forrest"
190068,forrest,2008-04-20 23:16:00,1032,"OK.  A friend of a friends sisters guy cousin just confirmed this:  Story behind Kalib Starnes running away:  Al-Quida placed a nuclear device in his jock and body sensors all over him.  If one of those sensors got hit, BLAMO!!!  Kalib is a hero!!!!"
190071,danbo,2008-04-20 23:24:00,2646,"How 'bout, Chuck Norris vs Bruce Lee?"
190082,danbo,2008-04-20 23:46:00,2646,
190090,skeeter,2008-04-20 23:58:00,1907,Gerritt that was hilarious. what made it even funnier was watching Your avatar up in the corner showing him what he was suppose to be doing............. LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Dann
190130,glirw,2008-04-21 01:41:00,200,"Overall, I'd have to say UFC 83 was pretty disappointing compared to previous shows.  I didn't get the flashy victory that I was so hoping for in the main event Travis Lutter ran out of gas Starnes ran out of courage  Everything else was everything else"
