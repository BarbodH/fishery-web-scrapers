189949,little angler,2008-04-20 16:27:00,128,"Two years ago i used that kinda of line but it was like 15lbs or something and was in a purple box , absolutely hated it . -It tangled way to easy -When i casted i saw my line was coiled -It also frays easily i found I'm back to Triline now  Good Luck Little Agnler"
189950,nancur373,2008-04-20 16:31:00,1211,thanks
189952,little angler,2008-04-20 16:36:00,128,no problem happy if i helped
189957,BillM,2008-04-20 16:59:00,17367,"On most muskie and pike setups you'll find super lines..  Spiderwire, Power Pro, Fireline etc...  I run 20lb Spiderwire on my baitcast setup for pike last year.  No complaints other then the line did discolour quite a bit from it's original shade.  I am going to respool with the same line, but start from the other end (So this year the untouched line close to the spool will be the line hitting the water).   Can't beat the super lines for strength or lack of stretch."
189958,irishfield,2008-04-20 17:02:00,26272," Remember there are different ""breeds"" of Spiderwire. Stealth would be the muskie variety !"
189962,nancur373,2008-04-20 17:17:00,1211,Do you guys still use leaders with these lines? If so what type? Is it better to go wire or mono or flouro?
189979,Roy,2008-04-20 18:44:00,13728,"If you're targeting esox, go with fluoro leaders. 80lbs+. So far, Seaguar is the best I've seen."
190066,nancur373,2008-04-20 23:11:00,1211,I decided not to go with the spiderwire and bought Power Pro 40lb instead. Is this too heavy?
190069,Greencoachdog,2008-04-20 23:16:00,8163,Should be just right!
190105,xrap,2008-04-21 00:48:00,683,Boooooo!! Spiderwire sucks!!!!
190164,BillM,2008-04-21 02:45:00,17367," You gotta remember 40lb Power Pro has the diameter of what, 10 or 12lb?  It's not to heavy at all...  I think I am going to run SpiderWire Ultracast Invisi-Braid on my muskie setup this year(as suggested by a seasoned pro), or 50lb PPro.  As for leaders, I think I'll let the guys at JB's set me up with some flouro or titanium single strand leaders."
190259,Marko,2008-04-21 12:44:00,854,"I dont understand why that heavy of a line is needed for pike fishing. Musky i get it, but pike arent as strong."
190562,nancur373,2008-04-21 23:23:00,1211,It's just me that's too strong. I don't want to break line when i set the hook...lol.  Thanks for the help guys.
190582,Burning Babies,2008-04-22 00:00:00,150," It's more of a handling issue - ultra thin line, heavy baits and baitcasters are a difficult combination to work with."
