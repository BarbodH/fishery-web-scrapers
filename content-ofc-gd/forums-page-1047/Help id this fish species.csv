190675,evster,2008-04-22 02:13:00,367,"Hey,  My wife and I went for a walk through a local park and crossed a stream.  There were about 75 of these guys all piled in one spot.  I have no clue what they are.  The pics aren't that great but maybe someone can recognize them.      Thanks! Evan"
190677,Casey123,2008-04-22 02:14:00,461,how long were they?
190678,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:15:00,2710,Pictures arent the greatest but Im going to say white sucker.
190679,ehg,2008-04-22 02:15:00,2666,male white suckers in spawn colours
190681,evster,2008-04-22 02:16:00,367,Oh yeah...they averaged about 8 to 10 inches I would say.
190684,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:21:00,2710,Yes heres a link look at photo Photo down abit in the middle not first photo you see http://www.naturenorth.com/spring/creature...er/Fwhsuck.html
190688,Victor,2008-04-22 02:25:00,1609,hey evster.  lol there's no way to tell from your pictures but i think i know which creek your talking about ... i go to the uni. of waterloo and saw the exact same thing last year around this time... they are suckers ... only here for probably 2 weeks or so and they'd disappear
190689,Joeytier,2008-04-22 02:25:00,3990,Suckers. The creek close to my house is full of them as well.
190692,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:28:00,2710,Yes Laurel Creek has oodles of them they dont dissapear they just arent spawning anymore so they tuck back up into the brush/banks/crap
190694,Joeytier,2008-04-22 02:29:00,3990,"I heard they hit flies pretty good. Do they fight good? My creek's closed right now, but on the opener, if there's no bows around, I wouldnt mind a shot at some of them."
190695,Gerritt,2008-04-22 02:30:00,6129,"If they are 8 to 10"" long.... The Muskie guys call em bait!  G"
190698,gone_fishin,2008-04-22 02:34:00,481,100% definitely suckers... most creeks and rivers are loaded with them right now. they spawn at the same time as the steelhead.
190745,outdoorguy61,2008-04-22 03:42:00,220,My granfather used to have me net them and stored in a pen by our dock many years ago in Bolsover Ont. They sure seemed to do the trick with holding fish close to our dock and bringing in the musky.  outdoorguy61
190773,Billy Bob,2008-04-22 11:23:00,5865,"VERY hard to identify from the pic but from what other are saying I am guessing there are creek chubs (that's what they are called here) and make very fine bait for bass, pike and muskie."
190823,evster,2008-04-22 13:16:00,367,Thanks guys!
