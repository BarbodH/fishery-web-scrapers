Currently I have the following equipment: 3 TDR rods I have the following reels:  A couple of questions: If I buy one more TDR rod, what should it be to compliment the others? What reel should go on what rod?  I plan on starting out flat-lining using planer boards and later going to dipsies and my one electric downrigger. Most of my Salmon fishing will be done in the spring.  Any help would be appreciated."

Wire dipsy 4. 10 colour lead-core for either the chute or off the boards.  Of course, the more the merrier after that.  :-)"

190131,moosehead,2008-04-21 01:42:00,90,"Roger I would pick up another 9'6""MH and use the 2 of them as dipsey rods, put the tekota on one and the accudepth on the other definetelty need braid or wire for these with linecounters. Put the gold cups on the other 2 rods and use one on the rigger and the other can be used for flatlining, might want to spool this one up with leadcore.  I will be running 2 9'6"" MH TDR's with braid as dipsey rods and 2 8' M TDR's with mono on the riggers.  Have you been out yet? I am going to try and get out next weekend, have heard good reports coming from the Jordan/ Port Weller area."
