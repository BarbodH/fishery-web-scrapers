190147,irishfield,2008-04-21 02:14:00,26272,"I brought mine home spring of 2005.. had it sandblasted.. then welded up some holes.. primed it with Tremclad primer and then put two coats of temclad paint on it. I touched up the below water line edges of it last summer as it was starting to lift.  Before I painted it I asked a friend that's been in the marine business for 35 years, and use to own Bay Mourings in Penetang, about whether to use an expensive 2 part epoxy or just good old Tremclad and he said go Tremclad as hasn't seen any life difference. The only issue with it is that it seems to absorb the water.. as the paint is a lighter colour on the under water section than above water. I figure I'll get another year or two before I have to prep the sides and bottom again... other than that inside is mint and above water mint.  "
