(This was my very first time painting...and like we women say after giving birth...NEVER AGAIN)  I made an absolute mess of the ceiling....I broke a glass vase, 2 long stem glass flowers and a ceramic candle holder.  But the biggest disappointment was when it was time to remove the painter's tape...the bleeping paint peeled...one wall is toast...and I figure that I will just go with Crown Moulding near the ceiling to hide the mess.  A friend was 3 walls too late in suggesting an exacto (spelling) knife, which did help.  Anyhow...I am giving you a before and after little looksie....  Thanks to Workwear for the ongoing advice....and thanks to Roy for being my audience today...   Before   After   Nancy"

190647,Big Cliff,2008-04-22 01:33:00,6899,Love the colour! Sorry to hear you had the problems!
190653,Gerritt,2008-04-22 01:48:00,6129,the trick is to cut in the ceiling with as little paint as possible and remove the tape before the paint dries... I like the suedes  also the knife trick works if you were too late in removing the tape.  consider it a lesson learnt  A simple fix though...   plastic off the walls and repaint the ceiling! LOL!..  If you were closer I am sure you would have alot of help!  G
