Nicole, my daughter Taylor and I had a great day out on the lake. We caught over 20 pike, some were big, some were not so big.  Here are a few pictures.  Taylor with her first fish of the season, she is quickly learning how to outfish her dad, once she get's better out casting watch out!!!     Me with the First REAL fish in the new boat lol    Nicole's first real fish of 08, she actually tried to hold this herself, but it was going to bite her so she dropped it and ran... well, not really, but I guess I could photoshop her in later...    It was a great day out there, many more to come this season!"
