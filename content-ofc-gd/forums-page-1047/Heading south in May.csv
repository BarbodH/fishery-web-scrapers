190725,mepps,2008-04-22 03:04:00,1301,"I have 2 weeks in Augusta in mid May to get some training for work.  I was thinking of traveling west to Alabama and fishing with one of our own OFNers - but they missus and the baby are gonna be joining me, so I gotta keep the road trips short.  I'll be 3 hours from Havannah, 2.5 hours from Atlanta.  Im thinking Atlanta may be the place to be since we can see the georgia aquarium and hit up Bass Pro (no Cabelas nearby).  As much as I'd love to do some saltwater fishing, its way out of my price range right now. I really hope to do some large mouth fishing though and have scouted out a couple nearby lakes.  I've got evening and a weekend to explore!   I watched an episode of Real Fishing recently where he was fishing a couple hours south of Augusta and they were hitting 7lb bass consitantly - I'd be happy with any size bass at this point!  Anyone have any experiences fishing the south?"
