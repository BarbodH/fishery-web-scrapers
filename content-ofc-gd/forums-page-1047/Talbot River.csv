A quick observation and question, I saw what looked like small perch hanging around the banks of the river but I was thinking that that may be a little far for a perch to come all the way from Simcoe.  Is it possible that they were very young Walleye?"

More likely though it be a immature walleye making a false run and just hanging out with all the cool kids in school.  (What, I'm the only one who thought that was funny???) Could have been a half dozen other things as well I suppose."
