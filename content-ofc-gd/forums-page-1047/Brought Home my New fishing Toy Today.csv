189896,brickNblock,2008-04-20 13:25:00,598, Sweet looking NEW BOAT Bud! I bet your on it all day today...even if its the carport. Mines been parked on the front lawn for a month now and every weekend Im on it figuring things out or adding items. WTG...heres to many enjoyable and successful outings.
189900,Roy,2008-04-20 13:35:00,13728,"Great boat Mike. Congrats! Just think, another year or two and you'll be fighting Ryan for the boat keys. :-)"
189917,John Glynn,2008-04-20 14:38:00,25,Beautiful rig Mike. What hp is the engine.
189935,Tomcat,2008-04-20 15:29:00,395,Sweet looking ride!! I'm envious.
189937,Carp,2008-04-20 15:47:00,1488,Congrats on the new boat. Looks great.
190153,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:30:00,3421,well Wayne wish I had more time for fishing .The body of water I was on is closed to all fishing until mid may.  I could go out on the Larry but friday I spotted big chunks of ice floating out there.This is the only place trout is open all year long.  I will be out in her next weekend  for trout opener .Please burn that hat
190155,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:33:00,3421,I bet you would take a Tiller right now over shore fishin eh Dog
190157,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:36:00,3421,Rob not sure about riggers yet I have to drive 90 mins to 120 mins to use them which I would only do 2 to 3 times per year .These places also charge 20 to 30 dollars to wash and park the boat.  BTW did you get your new boat yet??????
190160,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:38:00,3421,Don don't you own a 12 footer with a tiller
190163,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:44:00,3421, Nope would not be fair Sonny you have a 60hp four cylinder and I have 50hp 3 cylinder you would surely leave me behind.  last year I was running beside you in another 1660 classic with a 60 merc console and we clipping along at 37mph and we barely passed you in the 2 chop .Your boat is faster than 32mph.
190168,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:48:00,3421, John I have a 50hp Honda.
190172,Mike the Pike,2008-04-21 02:52:00,3421,Well thanks for the kind words folks it is the boat I have always wanted I was very surprised at how smooth it really runs.  Hopefully next weekend I can put some fish slime in it.  MTP  Why is it when I click the multi quote button nothing happens.How can I multin quote in just one post
190176,douG,2008-04-21 03:05:00,2693,"Very nice ride, Mike, that is definitely the smile of a proud owner.  As for the multiquote, it's a lot of cutting and pasting I think."
190179,Joeytier,2008-04-21 03:12:00,3990,"Wow, what a beauty of a boat!"
190182,carll2,2008-04-21 03:15:00,443,amazing boat mike!! my dream.. good luck for opener  looks like masawipi will be your best bet...mempremagog is still looking white
190185,Musky or Specks,2008-04-21 03:47:00,2710,Bass Guys arent crazy for ging fast... They are crazy because when you go that fast you might as well be pouring gas right out of your tank. At a buck twenty a litre THATS crazy!!!
190204,Chris,2008-04-21 10:11:00,405,"Nice rig Mike, congrats. I have a 50 Honda as well (on a Lund 1650 Sendero) and get roughly the same top end. The 50 Honda is bulletproof...you'll love it.   Plus I see you are a connoisseur of fine music."
190242,mattyk,2008-04-21 12:01:00,2110,sweet looking ride!
190244,solopaddler,2008-04-21 12:15:00,8605,"Mike, as far as I'm concerned you've got yourself the ultimate boat, congrat's!"
190246,Spiel,2008-04-21 12:17:00,9065,"....A big Lund tiller, sweeeeet !"
189697,Mike the Pike,2008-04-20 00:27:00,3421,Well the Day finally came and it was time to pick up my 2008 New Lund 1660 Classic.  Arrived at the Dealer bright and early I chose the right position for my Seat at the tiller and the dealer proceded to bolt her down.  After that they quickly installed my rod holders on the sporttraks and I was off to the Launch with my dealers mechanic to try out the boat.   While I was waiting for last minute details I managed to take a pic of my old boat now motorless A Lund SSV 18 footer.I bid my final farewell and off to the launch we went.   At the Launch well there was no Launch it was under water because the water on the Richelieu River was 5 feet higher than normal.The entire launch was under water including the cement sides. There were some lads removing minnow traps that are left in the water all winter.   After trying out all my new gadgets like the new Lowrance GPS Combo and I also tried my new bow mount out which I know I am going to love .Gone will be the days where I tried to control the big tinny with a Transom mount electric motor.Finally some boat control.         One thing I did notice the sides of this boat are much higher than my SSV.     I think I am in love  I found this boat handles like a Cadillac so smooth.She is not that fast but I was Happy to manage a top speed of 32mph on the GPS.Rolling along with tunes full throttle now that was awesome listening to Hells Bells from AC DC.  I can't wait until next weekend for Trout opener .  Now I have alot of reading to do have to figure out how all this technology functions.  Hope I can sleep tonight.  MTP
