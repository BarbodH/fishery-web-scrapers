Also some nice morning shots of the marina.            I did take cuddles for a walk aswell.    I didnt take any shots of the driving range we hit today,as I did not want to offend anyone After that is was a skate comp for the young one,well he still is young   . Great to see so many young fellas competing and having a great time.        And last but not least,Grandma and mother to be.    Thanks for looking.  Poppy Brian"

190177,douG,2008-04-21 03:09:00,2693,"Poppy Brian, that sounds great.  Thanks for the shots, that's a nice place you live in."
190275,Rattletrap2,2008-04-21 13:26:00,1652,"Hey ""Poppy"" Brian, Hope you don't mind, but I saved #7. That is a beautiful shot! Thanks for sharing your day!"
190454,misfish,2008-04-21 19:40:00,29133," Hey Sink there is a huge one there aswell. He walked in like he owned the yard,the shot didnt turn out very good so I didnt post it.  Thanks for the comments on that 7th pic. I cant understand why my camera can take great pics at times and crap ones like the turkey ones. Guess Im going to have to finally invest in a new one.  Hey Mr.B,Nice to hear from ya bud,hope alls well."
190504,Gerritt,2008-04-21 21:47:00,6129,Brian... my guess is the digital zoom...  by that I mean in your other shots your using your cameras optical zoom... in those long range turkey pics your into digital (Crap) zoom.  G
