The issue I ran into was once the boat was in the water the elec trim for my T8 yamaha kicker wouldnt work. It worked in the driveway when tested but has since stopped. I was able to get it up manually but havent been able to get it to work since. Battery is fine and all fuses fine so just wondering if anyone has even ran into anything like this and if so and thoughts on what it could be.  I am new to the boat ownership thing and unfortunately dont know a whole lot about these things. So any thoughts are appreciated. I figure I will have to bring it in but thought if there were any thongs I could try it would be worth it.... I just dont know what it could be as it worked fine until the weekend then just stopped......  Thanks in advance,  Benny"
