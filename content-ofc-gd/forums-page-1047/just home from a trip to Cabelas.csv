It pays to shop around.  I got a hummingbird 565 for the wife's fishing position on the back of the boat at fleet & farm for $175, (cabela's and bass pro wanted $199). picked up a eagle 640c for the front of the boat (where I direct the action) for $449 at cabelas. got a new mk510 battery charger, several baits (sonars & cicada's) , a new drift sock (reg $70 for $35) at cabelas. ram mounts for the depth finders and a universal sonar cord for the 640c.  Got a deal on the optimax engine oil, $30 for a gallon, here in red lake the marinas charge $60 a gallon, so i grabbed 4 of them .  Too bad I can only make the trip once a year , maybe it wouldn't run $1000 a trip for fishing gear."

190690,Gerritt,2008-04-22 02:27:00,6129,sounds to me like you saved a fortune! Well worth the trip in my eyes!  G
190776,Billy Bob,2008-04-22 11:30:00,5865,I LOVE Cabela's and it's probably better there is no store anywhere near me and all my purchases are mail order.  I probably spend between 2-3K each year on stuff from Cabela's but that includes hunting and clothes plus Christmas gifts.  What I like is they have always stood behind what they sold. NEVER had a problem with sending something back even after it's 6-7 months old. I wish more companies were like that.  Bob
190874,bigbuck,2008-04-22 15:00:00,2449,I'm trying to set up a pilgrimmage to the Cabela's in Dundee Michigan one of these days to check it out and give my credit card a workout. Good to hear you saved a bundle.
190887,Billy Bob,2008-04-22 15:28:00,5865,When you guys travel back over the border do you have to declare the purchases made in the USA and do you get charged a duty fee ? ? ?   If so that would really cut into the savings eh  Bob
190913,BillM,2008-04-22 16:45:00,17367, Depends if the goods are declared or not  :)  Should they be?  Yes..  Have I had bouts of amnesia when buying things in the US and bringing them back over the border?  Many times....
