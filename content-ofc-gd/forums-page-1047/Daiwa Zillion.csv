143924,Alumacraft,2007-12-19 13:35:00,139,"I have the 100HA its a great reel for heavy or light baits. It's the sweetest baitcaster I have ever owned definetly the longest casting reel. Super smooth drag/micro click adjustment,6.3 gear ratio and the best magnetic cast control system.I'm planning on buying another one before next spring. If you pick one up you will not be disappointed."
