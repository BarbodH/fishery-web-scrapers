189974,Big Cliff,2008-04-20 18:22:00,6899,"Nice day, sun is shining, decided to hook up my irrigation system: Everything went according to plan, hooked up the pump, intake line, just had to put the foot valve out in the lake. It's Ok, the water is only up to my knees, no problem so I waded out , set up the intake, stood back and admired my setup. I turned to head back to shore, slipped on a rock, fell over my marine railway and ended up swimming. DAM THAT WATER IS STILL COLD! My buddy (if you know what I mean) pulled a turtle and I doubt I'll see him for a few hours (he doesn't like cold LOL). Nothing hurt but my pride but I am starting to think this kind of work is best suited to the younger guys LOL. Anyway just had my first swim of the season and probably the first swim anywhere in Sturgeon Lake this year! Glad there was no one there with a video camera or that one would have gotten posted on the internet as ""what not to do""! LOL"

You have decent neighbours then I guess cause when I slipped and fell on the ice 2 years ago while shovelling the driveway I was embarassed as hell and didn't want look around to see if the neighbours had seen me fall. Finally, on my way back into the garage I got the courage to take a peek across the road and saw three of my scum neighbours holding up signs. 9.9, 9.8 and 7.6. I owe them big time."
