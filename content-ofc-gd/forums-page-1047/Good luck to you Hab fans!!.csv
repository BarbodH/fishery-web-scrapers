187996,KyleM,2008-04-16 04:11:00,218," I didnt think it was worth replying to...... I guess if you want me to say something, I will.  Toronto has zero grit and no heart, thats why they have missed the playoffs the past few years and thats why they will continue to hang around the back of the pack. You know aswell as I that regular season records mean squat come playoffs. Thomas is playing amazing and to be honest, tonites game belonged to the Bruins.   Who says Im a Habs fan?????????  I guess a quick whitted Leafs fan could only miss that hahaha"
188027,Chris,2008-04-16 11:26:00,405,"Well, in last night's game, the reffing was much, much better and what a game it was. Hockey played the way it should be played. Only disapointment was the habs won.  I now change my prediction to ""the Bruins in seven""  Go Bruins Go!!!"
188136,blaque,2008-04-16 15:54:00,2419,"Rick Jeanerette and Jim Lorenz were our LONG TIME pair calling the games. Lorenz retired last year as he was ready to settle his feet and didnt like the travel anymore ........and we somehow brought Harry Neal on board to replace him. Im as confused as you are as to how we pryed him away from Canada.  As a sidenote, i like the unique sound of Harry Neal, unmistakable voice that is just plain ""Hockey"" to me when i hear it, but im not thrilled with him in Buffalo. We had Buffalo guys here forever, true hardcore long term Buffalo guys.......a comfort zone if you will with them, and Harry , as good a guy as he is, just doesnt seem like the right fit. Not knockin him at all, But its hard to get used to letting a new guy into the circle."
188262,DanTheMan,2008-04-16 21:18:00,257,"This is my Favorite annoucer, Chris Cuthbert.     Why cbc let him go, I dunno. Oh well, TSN gain and cbc's lost"
188266,carll2,2008-04-16 21:25:00,443, for the bruins to win theyd have to win 3 games in a row..i highly doubt that will happen with 2 of 3 next games beeing in montreal(if needed)...GO HABS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!! nah nah nah ...nah nah nah  heyyyy goooodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
188273,Gerritt,2008-04-16 21:39:00,6129,Some great replies! My problem with Cole is he commentates on Leafs games... and he obviously HATES the Leafs.... and your right about not knowing the players names... I am surprised he knows his own!  G
188329,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 22:55:00,481,"  right, you're a bruins fan, sorry... obviously i'm not too quick witted am i? hahaha  like i said, i know the leafs sucked this year, but i still think it could have been a close series.  and i REALLY hope the bruins do take the series... cause i hate the canadiens."
189070,holdfast,2008-04-18 12:55:00,1813,ALL QUIET ALONG THE EASTERN FRONT.  Big Bad Bruins are digging in for a Battle to eliminate the Montreal Europeans.  Half the Team have dropped their Arms and are Running to the Hills.  Their Leader is nowhere to be seen and no one wants to step up as they may meet certain death or injury.  However there is hope as Komerserek is ready to take up the slack for the Team.  Atta Boy.
189082,Chris,2008-04-18 13:19:00,405, Yep nah nah nah nah fer sure. 5-1 buddy!!! 8th place vs. first place. Should've left the riot police and parade floats at home. They may have scared the Bruins into hammerin' the habs the way they did. Gotta feel for young goalie Price tho'.....NOT.  Woooohoooo Bruins in 7  Go Bruins Go
189127,walleyejigger,2008-04-18 14:39:00,876,"yup bad game for the boys,(well half a game anyways) and a tough lesson for price, looked like a ""workplace injury"" instead of doing it the safe way he tried to take a short cut and got bit, oh well live and learn, he'll bounce back,  sure makes it a whole lot more interesting, lovin the flames/shark series aswell  GO HABS GOOOOOOO"
189150,KyleM,2008-04-18 15:23:00,218,"Loved the game.  I love Don Cherry LOL  To think the Leafs would have put up the same battle is a little ""out there"""
189185,corvette1,2008-04-18 16:30:00,1765,still alive
189189,Stoty,2008-04-18 16:39:00,2910,"Would rather have my teams go 6 or 7....they get me more points in my hockey pools!!! Pens...sure they killed OTT, but they only played 4 games. DET/SJ/CGY/MTL are all playing at least 6... As long as DET and SJ win, I am golden!"
189190,Headhunter,2008-04-18 16:43:00,5703,"It appeared to me anyway, that Montreal was suffering from the same illness that apparently had taken over the good folks in Ottawa... NO FLIPPIN HEART! Man, I can't get over how playoff teams can come across as being so un-interested. They seemed to be going through the motions... I wonder if Canadian hockey teams have been given a deal at their local golf course because they sure look like their gettin ready to shine up the clubs! HH"
189672,holdfast,2008-04-19 23:29:00,1813," No its not the Golf.  Over half of the team would rather go home and brag about their exploits and how much money they make.  They would rather do that than risk injury, for a cup that we Canadians and Americans cherished while Growing up.  Lets face it, half the players have family over- Seas.  By the way, you notice how these games are looking like soccer games/  lots of acting.  Yea I like Cherry too, Great Canadian and Hockey Mind,  I like his Latest Point.  All the Scrums that we are Experienceing Lately,  His point being that if the Refs would let it go, half of the players would Sheeet themselves.  Montreal is a Classic team.  A bunch of wimps with visors chatting it up, instead of duking it."
189762,KyleM,2008-04-20 01:54:00,218,"Totally agree, diving bunch of women.  The true heart shines through"
189782,walleyejigger,2008-04-20 03:02:00,876,"if ya watch the games both teams are pretty even on the diving, guess you guys are watching with one eye closed,a shame either way, and if you've watched any habs regular season games you'd see that they've brought up their physical play quite a bit, the first three games were quite physical, they're stepping up in that area but it's the only one IMO,  they need to get back to their game,"
190187,KyleM,2008-04-21 04:03:00,218,"One problem, the Bruins were supposed to step up to Montreal....not the other way around.  It comes down to the coaching situation IMO.  I love the excuses on the TSN website too.....""that last goal was off-side"" That was way to close to call and nevermind the fact that the B's were pushing the entire game.  Poor fellas, theyll be singin oleeee ole ole ole on the fairways."
190206,Chris,2008-04-21 10:21:00,405,"Win or lose tonight, I'm so proud of my Bruins. They're giving the first place team a darn good go. There has been some dummy style reffing (again in game 6) and I hope they don't factor in the outcome tonight. When the refs stay out of it, these two teams put on a real good show.  Good luck to the Habs fans. I'll be cheering the Bruins on tonight and may the best team win.    p.s. to the Habs fans.....if the Habs win, please don't sing ole' ole' or nah nah nah"
190207,Roy,2008-04-21 10:27:00,13728,Well said Chris.
186936,KyleM,2008-04-14 13:46:00,218,"The refs have done their job IMO. This series could easily be 2-1 for the Bruins right now.  You clowns that say Toronto would have given Montreal a run?  GIVE ME A BREAK.  Stop dreaming guys, the Leafs have sucked for awhile now.... they wernt giving anyone any scares this season. The only reason the B's are doing so well is because of their D type play...something the Make Me Laughs really lack."
187073,gone_fishin,2008-04-14 17:50:00,481,"  I'm not disagreeing that the leafs were terrible this year... but come on... Leafs vs Canadiens in the playoffs... it would be a battle and a half. this year the two teams played 8 times, the leafs won 4 (one of which was in overtime), the Canadiens won 4 (one was in overtime, and another in a shootout). and you don't think it would be a close series???"
187242,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-14 22:25:00,4399,  If you mean the interim captain he was the one that scored the overtime winner after one of the big tough guys you like drove his head into the ice.
187265,holdfast,2008-04-14 23:01:00,1813,"All I seen him do yesterday was flopping on the ice and barking like a seal.  Other than that, invisible.  Oh yea, way too many penaltys, I mean Boston.  Watch the other Games, except Ottawa, and tell me if Mtls little fellas, and big Muffies, stand up to the other teams.  They are playing like theyre at war with each other.  Not the turn my back when I hit, or get hit,  so I wont get bruised type game, that MTL favors.  As far as getting his head drilled, seems like it worked, Kovelev and the other Russians are puck shy now."
187341,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-15 00:54:00,4399,your comments about Europeans and Quebecers are getting a little boring and are starting to make you sound like a biggot!
187381,darsky,2008-04-15 02:13:00,586,LOL  Careful he may pm you challenging you to a fight
187575,walleyejigger,2008-04-15 15:31:00,876,"at least there is ONE post without his clever    brisebois translation,  if ur gonna translate something, do it right  it would be Breakwood, either way not even remotely funny  GO HABS GOOOOOOOOOO"
187731,carll2,2008-04-15 20:54:00,443,"to have met brisebois and hung out with him hes not an amazing player but has some expirience to help the team.. this is why i love playoff hockey!!! its a whole different game, the teams that once sucked during regular season(boston( know that its thier last chance so of course thier gunna give it all they got."
187906,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-16 01:46:00,4399,  nah nah nah nah hey hey hey good bye!  and the winning goal is scored by holdfast`s favorite player!
187910,darsky,2008-04-16 01:48:00,586,Brisbois AKA Broken Wood ==========================   GAME WINNING GOAL !!!!!!!!  WTG!!!!!
187916,DanTheMan,2008-04-16 02:00:00,257,Ugly win's count
187920,Gerritt,2008-04-16 02:08:00,6129,Now comes the real debate...  Anyones else hate Bob Cole?  G
187923,KyleM,2008-04-16 02:10:00,218,"yep.....an ugly win for a couple of ugly fans LOL  BTW, I agree with holdfast....and im no biggot!!!!!!!!"
187943,Stoty,2008-04-16 02:31:00,2910,"YA HABS!!!  I am by NO MEANS a habs fan, but they won me $37.50 tonight!!!"
187954,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-16 02:41:00,4399, Oh baby the last 2 games I turned to RDS after 5 minutes.
187957,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 02:46:00,481,"  DUDE!!!!! you have no idea how much me and my dad rip Bob Cole apart every time he does a game... hahaha!  here's my impression of Bob Cole...  ""and the bruins come up the ice, and get a good shot on net, it was deflected, but the canadien's goalie makes a great save, then the canadien's bring it out of the zone. the bruins make a good attempt to stop them but they get it into the zone... there's a shot, but the bruins goaltender makes the stop and it goes over the netting into the crowd""  he has seriously gone senile... he doesn't know any of the players' names. just terrible... and he signed another contract with CBC for next year... i'm just going to have to kill him... like really, he's never going to quit is he...  P.S. I'm not really going to kill him... i just wish he would either quit or i wish CBC would let him go... like seriously... this has gone too far."
187963,irishfield,2008-04-16 02:56:00,26272,He's the only commentator that I can have the game on with my back to the TV and I know when to turn around for something good. Try that with any of the TSN mono tones.
187964,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-16 02:56:00,4399, no biggot just a closet Don Cherry!
187966,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 02:58:00,481," TSN colour guys may not be the greatest either, but Jim Houson is the best guy goin right now!"
187969,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 03:01:00,481, by the way... why hasn't KyleM responded to my response to his leaf bashing comment that he left yesterday... i guess it made too much sense for a HABS fan to understand! hahahahaha  see page 2 if you missed it.....
187970,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-16 03:04:00,4399,"none of the current talking heads can compare with the past greats, Danny Galivan, Dan Kelly, Bill Hewitt those guys knew how to call a game."
187973,darsky,2008-04-16 03:09:00,586,Dick Irvin
187974,gone_fishin,2008-04-16 03:10:00,481,"Danny Galivan, Dan Kelly, Bill Hewitt are all WAY before my time, so i can't really comment on them, but right now, Jim Houson is the best guy goin! he should have the number one spot on CBC right now... unfortunately Bob ""Senile"" Cole has that position until he dies....."
187986,kennyman,2008-04-16 03:51:00,737,I loved Harry Neal as a colour guy. Somehow Buffalo stole him?
187988,holdfast,2008-04-16 03:57:00,1813,"Good move by the coach, Put Streit forward and use the young guy.  Dont play Brisbois much on Defence and use him on the powerplay.  That way the Bruins dont have free rein around the crease.  Now if he can only come up with a plan for Hammer-Lick and MarKov maybe they wont own the Mtls net when Komerserek is resting.  Yup, lucky win thanks to the penalty, otherwise could of been 2,2 Series.  Again most of the team was hiding except maybe Begin, Kostalopolus, Higgens.  Mtls got to do some rebuilding if they want to keep up with the other teams.  And what about that Captain?????  Where was he."
186199,KyleM,2008-04-13 00:04:00,218,"Well, Iam a huge Bruins fan but its great to see the Habs in the playoffs.  Either team with a W in the series is good for me.  Its always a great match-up when you have two amazing coaches going at it.  There is no way in hell that Ill wish the Sens goodluck."
186246,Gerritt,2008-04-13 01:21:00,6129,2-2 Going down to the wire!  G
186276,sturgman,2008-04-13 01:50:00,249,Sudden death.... Soon to be 3-2 Bruins    I have 2 faveroite teams. The leafs and anyone who is playing Montreal. Go Bruins go!!
186277,gone_fishin,2008-04-13 01:54:00,481, Hahaha    good call! but i don't know how the Bruins made it this far... man they suck!
186278,gone_fishin,2008-04-13 01:58:00,481,"there it is, game over"
186346,lickmyarmpit,2008-04-13 03:18:00,359,"That was a nail biter, cant wait to meet the habs in the finals ......go red wings!"
186351,sturgman,2008-04-13 03:24:00,249,"What ever happened to the unwritten rule in overtime , where you had to practically take a guys head off for a penalty.. The ref's won this game for Montreal.. That call in overtime was a freakin joke, and a disgrace to the game of hockey.  3 years ago= no penalty     Montreal still sucks!!"
186357,gone_fishin,2008-04-13 03:42:00,481,"i agree, LAME penalty indeed! those refs are getting worse as each game passes. it's hard to watch games sometimes when these guys are calling a penalty every time a player breathes on one of his opponents. and they are so inconsistent from game to game."
186359,Carp,2008-04-13 03:45:00,1488,"  Fortunately for the habs, the Leafs didn't make the playoffs. I think they would have given Montreal a much tougher time than Boston."
186363,gone_fishin,2008-04-13 03:47:00,481," i agree, me and my dad were just discussing that tonight during the game."
186367,sturgman,2008-04-13 03:54:00,249,Either way a crappy call in overtime like that just burns my ass
186371,Gerritt,2008-04-13 04:06:00,6129,no worries... the Ref's are ruining the Dallas/Anaheim game as well.......... Argh...  G
186376,sturgman,2008-04-13 04:22:00,249,"  Been noticing the same thing tonight Gerritt. Seems the ""good ol Hockey game"" is long gone.............."
186377,gone_fishin,2008-04-13 04:25:00,481,"it'll never be the same. even if the league decides to try going back, the fans will expect the lame calls and boo every time someone falls to the ice. they've ruined hockey!"
186396,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-13 06:02:00,4399,  LOL maybe next year if they change the playoff format to lets say 1st  place plays 12th place you may have your shot!!!
186397,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-13 06:06:00,4399,  I agree they have taken this too far to much flopping and diving.  Just want to say thanks to Claude Julien for having the guts to have his 2 cement heads on the ice at critical times and taking stupid penalties.
186480,nancur373,2008-04-13 14:08:00,1211,How about the lame assed call on Kovalev to give Boston the 5 on 3 after he was beaten down to the ice and pinned.
186509,bbog,2008-04-13 15:17:00,665,The refs certainly did their best to kill this game - but the expected outcome was the same.
186582,DanTheMan,2008-04-13 20:23:00,257,  !!!!!GO HABS GO!!!!!
186591,Mike the Pike,2008-04-13 20:42:00,3421, I here ya Dan go Habs go can you hear the Habs bashers.  You poor guys have nothing better to do than pick the refs and the Habs apart.  Have you ever been a ref in a game if you think its easy then your whacked these guys do the best they can with pucks that go over 100mph.  In this day and age there is more sticks stuck in players faces than in the old days when there were no helmets and visors worn.  Good for them if they are calling more penalties than before all these refs are Neutral and do not favor certain teams this is why they travel.  Oh and that 4 minute major was a great call by the refs for the stick in the face that drew BLOOD. I think when this happens the GUILTY player should be thrown out of the game.  Its too late when the player loses an eye.  If your team is out accept it.Our Habs have been there.When they were not in the playoffs I have always cheered for the remaining Canadian teams.  Yup its been along time since the cup has been in CANADA if you like seeing those parades in the US keep cheering for the US teams.   If the Habs don't make it all the way one thing is for sure I will be cheering for the CANADIAN team.  So keep on wining you winers for now I hope the STANLEY CUP RETURNS TO CANADA where Hockey was created.   
186645,DanTheMan,2008-04-13 22:08:00,257,"  Like Koivu a few years ago and NO CALL??????? So, it all evens out!!!!!!!!!"
186875,Chris,2008-04-14 11:16:00,405,NaNa...NaNaNaNa.....heyhey....goodnight  Ole'...Ole'....Ole'....Ole'   The Bruins pretty much dominated last night   (despite the unbelievably lopsided officiating). So much for a habs sweep. I'm picking the Bruins in six. If I were a habs fan (don't worry it'll never happen) I'd be very worried.  Go Bruins go.
186878,DanTheMan,2008-04-14 11:24:00,257,"If we play like that again, I got to agree. We wont last at all!!!"
186885,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-14 11:41:00,4399,  Well I agree with the officiating bit it`s just plain lousy on both sides. The Bruins played well but it was one of those phantom calls that was coming that allowed the extra attacker(Savard) to be on the ice and he scored. So despite what you think about the officiating last night they handed Boston the win.
186908,holdfast,2008-04-14 12:50:00,1813,"yea typical.  A bit of hitting and the Europeans disappear ( Practically the whole Team).  Where was the Habs tough, lead by example Captain.  Mtl has no chance if they make it past Boston.  For the Record, I feel sorry for my favorite player Komeserek.  The only guy with Balls. Oh and Carrey also.  He was doing the work that Hamerlik, Markov, Brisbois (AKA BROKENWOOD) Streit, did I leave any European or Quebec defence out.  Where is Boullion anyways and that new guy number 3."
