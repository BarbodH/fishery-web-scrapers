188904,LundGuy,2008-04-18 01:12:00,169,There doesn't seem to be any shortage of fishing or family companions in this forum. Nice to see so many wonderful pets and caring owners.
189173,hawkeye,2008-04-18 16:00:00,162,"Well somebody already broke the feline barrier so I thought I would add this little guy. Pure bred Siberian kitten, not very common a color point variety sometimes called a Neva Masquerade  "
189495,Joey,2008-04-19 13:10:00,9122,"Well my feline is like a dog so does that count  He's a very stressed cat as you can see from the pic.   His name is Felix, but his nickname is Chili, because he's so cool    Joey"

189500,mistyjr1,2008-04-19 13:57:00,97,"Great pictures everyone.  Here is the ""Misty Clan"" Dog name Lainey.  She is going to be four years old this summer.  I still remember the day we picked her up.  She is a HUGE part of the family and she knows it, heck she is on the casting deck chair.  "

189765,LundGuy,2008-04-20 02:01:00,169,"  Great shot,I remember my yellow hunting lab Niki doing that, brings back many good memories."
189920,hawkeye,2008-04-20 14:51:00,162,"We sure are animal lovers that's for sure. So here's the whole herd. Ivan, the Siberian, I posted before, but here he is again at 3 1/2 months of age. Pretty small compared to the others but they mature slowly taking up to 5 years to get to adult size. Ivan Czarovich, Ivan son of Czar. Small in size but fearless    The old girl of the group is a 6 1/2 month old Norwegian Forest kitten. Jenny (Jensynn) is a wonderful girl but somewhat skittish. She mothers Ivan    Lastly the gentle giant of the group Dora (Dora Explorer) a 4 1/2 month old Maine Coon Cat. Such a sweet loving kitten, best I have ever had    And there you have the forest cat family, all 3 breeds. Although the color point Siberian is a source of conflict. Some say that since neither the Main Coon or Norwegian Forest cats have the color point variety the Siberian is not a forest cat. However the color point can occur between 2 non color point parents. Anyway these are ""the kids"" in our house."
190145,LundGuy,2008-04-21 02:10:00,169," Nice cats and I love cats , unfortunately I just found out this year that I am allergic to cats. I was going into some customers houses to quote work they wanted done and found my self sneezing uncontrollably . I thought it was just the sun or maybe some dust. Then I started to see cats showing up every once in a while and always when I was sneezing, never when folks had dogs. So I got tested and low and behold, I have a cat allergy.   Funny thing , my wife and I had cats for years and never a problem. Guess age has something to do with it."

Got my beagle from a foster home while living in my fraternity house during college.  His mom's owners didn't want to deal with the pups so they shipped them away as soon as they could.  He was only $150.00 with all his shots and checkups. (just to cover the expenses for the foster home)  Since then I've had to spend a fair bit of money on him as he likes to get into things. Stiches from getting kicked by a cow next door, he got into the garbage and swallowed a trout hook so that surgery was like $1200.00 etc. etc. but all well worth it and I'm glad to have my buddy with me.  Otherwise I'd be the only guy at the house!  Here's Tamias and I taking a break from a game of ball hockey on the back pond.  He gets frustrated because he can't keep up with me on the ice! "
