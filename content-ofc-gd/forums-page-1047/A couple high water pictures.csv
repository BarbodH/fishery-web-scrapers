190808,lew,2008-04-22 12:49:00,12767,"We spent this past weekend at my buds place north of Peterboro and took a drive around the area to check out the high water that's causing so many problems for some folks in the area.  This is the lock at Lakefield and it gives a pretty good indication of the amount of water being dumped into the narrow Otonabee River south of town. It doesn't show too well in the pics, but some of these waves were close to 5' high. Hard to believe boats will be navigating these waters in a couple more weeks......hopefully.      This is the dam at Youngs Point a few miles north of Lakefield. The 3rd picture is the ice flows coming down from Clear Lake and some of these were about 200 sq. ft. and 4-5"" thick.  The water was about 5' above normal in this area but has evidentely dropped about a foot in the last few days.        And of course all the critters were out enjoying the nice spring weather.  "
190827,Roy,2008-04-22 13:26:00,13728,"Really nice pics, Lew. Thanks for the update. That colour water always reminds me of pickeral and the opening nights at Hastings."
190828,Reef Runner,2008-04-22 13:30:00,981,Nice pics Lew.  Thanks for sharing.  Might be a rough opener this year.
190832,highdrifter,2008-04-22 13:41:00,2534,WOW.  That's a lot of water.  That first shot is a good indication of how high the water is! Hard to believe the wall I've stood on so many times is submerged.  Should be good for the smallies this year.. bad for home owners..  cheers HD
190834,Joey,2008-04-22 13:59:00,9122,"Cool pics Lew, thanks for sharing those.  Joey"
190842,mattyk,2008-04-22 14:06:00,2110,some nice pics lew. Lots of water! I wonder how all this high water will affect the fish spawning this year.
190843,Garry2Rs,2008-04-22 14:07:00,1425,Seeing all that water makes me glad that they repaired/renewed the bridges at Young's Point and Burliegh Falls ... GRIN.
190880,Casey123,2008-04-22 15:11:00,461,NO WADING FOR A LITTLE WHILE!
190882,bpsbassman,2008-04-22 15:20:00,941,Unbelievable Power!!
190884,smbhunter,2008-04-22 15:20:00,186,"Great shots lew. That's alot of water. In a way all this water is a good thing, it will boost up the levels in some lakes that need it. Look out in about 3-5 years when most species will be of catchable size from this year. More spawning habitat available and more oxygen in the water for fish like walleye and trout. The bad news is for the people that are directly affected by the high water."
190911,lew,2008-04-22 16:41:00,12767,"I was talking to a few of the locals up there on the weekend and it sounds like a lot of docks have been pulled from their footings and drifted out into the lakes after all the high water this year, so it looks like we'll have to be even more careful on the water this spring.  Don't want to be hitting a submerged dock in the middle of the lake at 40 MPH"
