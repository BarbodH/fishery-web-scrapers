190543,jeffw,2008-04-21 22:47:00,267,Is it the pressure or the return line that you need or both??
190547,sonny,2008-04-21 23:00:00,511,"did you punch a hole in the rubber part of the hose or the aluminum??,,,if it is the rubber part of the hose it can prob be replaced with a new rubber peice for much cheaper,,,what you will have to do is take the hose off and bring it to a hydrolic line place and they should be able to make you up a new hose by replaceing the rubber part,,,i know i have done it here in hamilton,but not sure where you are from,"
190580,Daplumma,2008-04-21 23:56:00,1961,After replaceing the hose you will have to evacuate the system and weigh in a new refrigerent charge.That is prolly why the charge is so much. Joe
