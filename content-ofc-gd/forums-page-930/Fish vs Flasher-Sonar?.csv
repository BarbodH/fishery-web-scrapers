Vex came out with it to knock Marcum down... vex is 400W, Marcum is 2000W  Look at it this way...  the more $$ you spend on a sonar, the more wattage it has... if wattage will drive fish away, why aren't the $1000+ sonars 500W  PAthetic to be honest with you... Vex's inferior product and lame marketing...  here's the new marketing ad on their site  "
