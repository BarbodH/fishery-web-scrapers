Very cold Water clarity : under 1 ft visibility Lure used: Pink Grub on 3/8 oz jig head line: 8 lb mono. Fish caught: 5lb rainbow trout.   Fish from 6:30am-4:00pm. A hard fishing day  My buddy and I both caught fish with this set up. Pink grub, half of a storm pink worm. I colored my jig head with Florou colored paint on jig head, the  buddy just used normal colored ones. We were not sure if this set up will work, but the pink color was the most visible color on stained water, we did fool the fish! I got lucky and caught it on my second cast. I would not have stick to this set up too long, and then the other guy asked me for some of it and he also caught one not too long. Now, I am convinced pink worm does work. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...jigheadpink.jpg  Trout picture was not too good, I was alone and have to do this quick. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...bum/rainbow.jpg   The other angler also landed his catch using roe."
