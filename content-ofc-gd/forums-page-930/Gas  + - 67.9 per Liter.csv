Remeber ...when you do the math... you gotta factor in the 30% difference in cost of USD$ ... so our current price of CDN 67 cents is not far from what you would expect at USD$40/bbl

Except that we are still getting hosed! The oil barons figure we are all stupid and will be happy to see the pump price down to less than half of what it was even though the barrel price has dropped to about 1/2 of it's highest value. What a rip, I say that though without taking into consideration the Canadian dollar's drop in value. But at least the price is better, I can't deny that."

I work for Syncrude, owned by Exon and as of the last financial report, the cost to produce 1 barrel of oil was $27.42.  You do the math on the Meryl Lynch report....????"
277860,Guest lundboy,2008-12-10 13:48:00,0,"Here's what I've heard...  Take it or leave it.  The price of oil will remain below $50 (with minor ups and downs) per barrel for at least the next 6 months to a year, so enjoy the cheap gas while you can.  Take advantage of it.  OPEC does not control the price of oil, and they will be ineffective at raising it back up causing the OPEC nations to suffer greatly until bankruptcy of some or most of them.  This is by design of the big oil companies to bring the OPEC nations to their knees, and to hurt the growing Russian oil industry.  A side affect of this is that the OPEC nations hold extensive American debt, and are one of the chief purchasers of this debt.  OPEC nations require a minimum of $80/barrel to fund their own societies, and will not be able to buy up any of the U.S. junk bonds and debt that they usually do, which will have a devastating affect on the US economy.  After about 6-12 months you can expect the price to rise substantially as OPEC falls and the US dollar tanks."

276296,Clampet,2008-12-06 17:21:00,1947,I don't understand how come the cost of gas has plummeted so low! Has the demand really subsided?

276304,Greencoachdog,2008-12-06 17:31:00,8163,"Yeah, I filled the truck up for $40 last week @ $1.71 per gallon/.45 a liter.  It seems that OPEC has some inner squabblings going on and they're reducing the price as a way to get even."
276305,ccmtcanada,2008-12-06 17:31:00,7971," Demand is down,  but that's not the only factor.  Speculators drove the price of a barrel of oil up for the past year or so, causing the raw materials for making gas more expensive.  A barrel of crude has dropped from around $148 down to $41, so it doesn't cost as much to buy that raw material.  Since the world is in recession, the outlook for the demand isn't looking great, so speculators are shying away from investing, thus the price is low.  The retail price is reflective of those two reasons, but also the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the US dollar.  You may think that since gas was at it's peak over $1.30 per liter...the cost of oil has dropped around 70%, that gas should also drop by 70% as well.  Since the price of oil is purchased on the world market in US$, when our dollar drops it still 'costs' more for us.  Also, there are fixed costs in production that don't move no matter what the price of oil is at, or what the value of our dollar is.  I'm not an expert...this is just how I believe it works...if anyone else can clarify anything I've written, it would be appreciated."
276325,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-06 18:19:00,2038,It was 69.7 cents a liter in Ottawa last night

276336,OhioFisherman,2008-12-06 18:29:00,6623,"CCMT ya you seem to have it right, demand is way down and expected to drop more, prices could get to 1-1.25 a gallon here as predicted by the experts. OPEC is supposed to meet to lower supply, but if there is no demand prices still won`t rise much.  Prices should remain lower as long as the recession is continuing, maybe a rise for the summer driving season. Still not a time to buy a gas guzzler if you don`t need one, rising oil prices might be a marker the recession is ending, but I don`t look for that soon."
276348,Grimace,2008-12-06 18:48:00,2020,at 44 dollars a barrel we should be paying around 42 cents a litre.    We are still getting chiseled.

276614,OhioFisherman,2008-12-07 05:27:00,6623,"Terry, don`t quote me on this but diesel is a denser fuel, I think they can get more gasoline out of a barrel of oil that diesel fuel.  Home heating oil is closer to diesel fuel than gasoline, one of the reasons a lot of owners-operators here used to live in the country where they used home heating oil to heat their homes.  Some found it`s way into the fuel tanks of the truck to lose the 40+cents a gallon highway use tax. None in home heating oil.  They do check, diesel has a dye in it, home heating oil doesn`t, they don`t check often though. They also like to see receipts to match amounts of fuel purchased to amount of miles driven. Anything way out of line can raise a red flag.  Truck scale stations along the highways do more than just weigh the trucks to ensure legal limits are observed. They are a convenient place for enforcement officers to examine loads, check logs, inspect the safety of the vehicle."

276616,ccmtcanada,2008-12-07 05:35:00,7971," Oil is bought by speculators on the world markets.  All current indications are pointing that the price for oil will remain low for a while.  Until the world economy is out of recession, demand will remain lower around the world.  In the past, when OPEC says they are going to restrict supply, the price always is driven up by those same speculators.  When the US states it's oil and gas reserves, if they go down then the price of oil also rises.  For the past few months, OPEC has tried to stabilize the price of oil by announcing cutback on production, but they've had no effect...it keeps dropping.  Same with US reserves...nothing seems to be stopping this slide right now.  Gas prices will always be variable, but I think you are safe for the holidays....it may go up a little, but nothing like what we saw this past summer."

276657,Billy Bob,2008-12-07 13:36:00,5865,It will remain low and might even drop a bit more until after Christmas. Then another bad report about the economy will drive the price even lower once retailers reveal how bad a Christmas year it was.
