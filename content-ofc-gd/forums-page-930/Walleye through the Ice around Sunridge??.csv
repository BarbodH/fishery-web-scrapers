277608,kuhaman,2008-12-09 21:35:00,503,"South bay, lake Nipissing. Not too far of a drive from Sundridge."
277668,irishfield,2008-12-09 22:58:00,26272,I'd think Barnard would be full of them... stop at the tackle shop at the lights and get them to point you in the right direction.  Safe ice would be the first step though... it ain't there now.
277675,steelhedrmatt,2008-12-09 23:08:00,278,"  I dont think there are walleye in Bernard? ( I could be wrong though) Cecebe, and Ahmic have good walleye populations, that's near Magnetawan."
277698,irishfield,2008-12-09 23:43:00,26272,Yah you may be very correct. Sounds like it has Lakers/whitefish and Ling.
277717,reelinrolly,2008-12-10 00:21:00,281,"I know bernard has ling, lakers and whitefish.......on Cecebe....wheres the best spot to walk out from?"
277722,Grimace,2008-12-10 00:34:00,2020,"If you go on google you can type, walleye fishing lake cecebe.   You will find and click on "" Ahmic and Cecebe fishing tips""   then click on lake cecebe  then it says "" If you would like a free copy of a lake fishing depth for Cecebe click here  and download a PDF file  ""      click on the word HERE   and it gives you a depth map.     Took me 5 minutes.   Good luck man.   Looks like there is a public access on the northwest part of the lake."
