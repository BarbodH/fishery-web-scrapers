277803,HTHM,2008-12-10 03:41:00,4082,Didn't anyone else notice the down-east accent? Might be a clue as to how he got those SKILLS!

277953,Reelpro,2008-12-10 18:49:00,73,"Guy's quick.  He did'nt zipper them though.  Missed the last step, for the filets to be 100% bone free.  For the ""fussy"" diners."
277968,Billy Bob,2008-12-10 19:28:00,5865,Far from a maintaining a clean sanitized surface to work on and I believe I can match up against him as I have been doing it for almost 40 years     But sometimes my fingers get in the way and I end up poking one or two of them going that fast.  My personal best is 70 crappies in one hour.
277984,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-10 20:16:00,64,Im suprised he still has all of his fingers
278004,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-10 21:20:00,3761, lol. He must fillet a lot of fish to be that fast.
278108,brkygetr,2008-12-11 01:37:00,425,"This might be a fun game...i have been a butcher for 15 years, not a nick i might add, and have been filleting fish since I was allowed out after dark...LOL. My buddies and I once had a 'debate  ' about this exact subject and I was sure I could come in under 30 sec....with ALL bones removed. The debate has never finished to this day....I am gonna assume that was about a 20(ish)"" walter so I think I will get it on tape over this winter and we'll see what happens. Any contenders??? That being said.....  thats amazing...I hate cleaning crappie. I actually don't, if someone will clean I will catch, but they are far too annoying for me. Billy Bob you must have been happy as a dog eatin' beat root when that was done...LOL  Cheers and sharp blades."
278244,Billy Bob,2008-12-11 14:12:00,5865," Actually I find crappies to be the easiest because you don't have to contend with belly meat, there is none. I think that is what makes filleting that fish the fastest.  Now yellow perch I find the toughest on my fillet knife as the skin/scales are the toughest around. I like to run my blade on a sharping steel about every 6-7 perch. Don't have to do that with any other fish. I like eating perch but they are definitely my least favorite to fillet.  BTW I still use just a regular 4"" fillet knife. Never tried a electric one.  Bob"
