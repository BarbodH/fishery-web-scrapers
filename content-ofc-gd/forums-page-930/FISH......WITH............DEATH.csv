273037,solopaddler,2008-11-28 20:28:00,8605,You are one seriously demented (and funny) dude!
273175,TerryC,2008-11-29 02:53:00,196,"Awesome Job, My wife and kids think I'm nuts cause I can't stop howling!!!  Well Done.   Clarence"
273188,Joey,2008-11-29 03:18:00,9122,"That was awesome, you should write children's books  Wouldn't the timmies just pour out of him when he drinks it  Joey"
273201,Streamerguy,2008-11-29 03:38:00,121,"That was pretty kool Snag....   You have and amazing sense of humour or maybe your a sick and twisted individual ? but i'd still fish with ya  Thanx for the post,funny stuff  Streamerguy"
273434,ccmtcanada,2008-11-30 00:02:00,7971," Hmmm...I have fished with him before.  If he gets a glassy look to his eyes, and starts to say ""Hey...I have a great idea for a report...could you stand over there on that rock by the rapids for me?"", run...run away fast and don't look back."
273721,TJQ,2008-11-30 23:04:00,7806,I finnaly got a chance to read it.. lol.. nicely done.....
274331,snag,2008-12-02 03:22:00,1932,"Thanks all,  I'm in Florida on business right now.  No time to fish unfortunately!  I'll reply to y'all below.  Cheers!"
274356,snag,2008-12-02 03:50:00,1932," Thanks Clamp, though I'm not sure they'd want my content!   I'm drying up!   Lurkers have honey holes!   Let's turn that handle on your face into SMILE!   Takes one to know one!   Your avatar make me howl!   Yeah, he's a slob. Drinking problem, you know...dead guys!!!    I'm glad you like my resume!   Let's go fishing Cliff, somewhere.. secluded.............   Great avatar, are you from Holland?."
277370,mepps,2008-12-09 04:10:00,1301,What have you done to my rockbass!!?!
277596,JohnF,2008-12-09 21:08:00,3494," Get out and hit the beach with yer camera then. Florida's always good for some dead stingrays and sharks if you walk a bit. They'd really cap yer depraved fish fiction. I can't help but respect a man who is not only over the top imaginative, but seriously twisted to boot.  Great job.  JF"
272588,snag,2008-11-27 17:17:00,1932,"O.k.  I'm not superstitious. But on the drive home the other day, I see this: A dark black funnel cloud forming over my house   Then I see this:  It was a little disconcerting.   Next day, I look out my window and I don't like the ominous shadow on my wall.   It's DEATH! oh crap! He's soul trolling and I'm the catch of the day!   I politely ask him to leave while I stay safe behind my door. I know Death cannot have your soul if you do not invite him in.   DOH! Now I'm screwed.   O.k. I was weak, So we strike up a deal, I'll take him to all my honey holes for a Multi-species, multi-spectacular day of fishing and he'll spare my soul.  Deal! and into the car we go. This dude is a talker. He's goes on and on while we're driving. ""I've fished the River of Styx, Love canal, Dead Sea, Hamilton Harbour....Blah, blah, blah......"" Couldn't wait to get to our spot so he'd shut up.  So we get to our honey hole and a couple local losers are crowding us out. I tell Dr.D that we should split. D says,""Hold on mortal""   Anyhoo, D waves his hand and harvests there souls! We get our spot back again! Man this dude ROCKS!   D gets his line in the water pronto    He's a little anxious because he's not catching any, so he's chain smoking. I tell him he should cut back on the smokes 'cause they'll kill you. He looks at me blankly.     Then suddenly, Bass On! Man this thing went nuts!  Then it didn't move so much.   I'm like,"" DUDE WHAT THE HECK??""  Wellllll, Turns out that one little detail Dr.Death didn't care to share was that, EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES DIES! So much for catch and release, LOL    Oh well, I figure I've fished with some real freaks before. I can handle his quirks.  Then suddenly, Pike on! Feisty, scrappy and mad  A little docile now as D tries to hand-land him. Doofus.   Like, 2 seconds later, another one slams his chartreuse HJ   Nice One. We forgot our tape so D puts it beside the rod for sizing   and the release shot. (She was hooked deep and I worry about her survival)     The action slows so we move on. Ran into DSN lakeside, He turned death onto carping. Nice fight here.  Seemed to lose a little weight pre-release?    We hit a local river and run into a local angler who's furious about fishing. The rockbass were jumping at anything.  Of course buddy had to hold it himself. Look out Rich, you're next.....   Salmon were jumping too!  Buuuuuuuut not for long. Impressive teeth.    We even ran into CCMT/Cliff at the mouth of the river.  He has a fish on, looks over and sees death, liquidates warmth into his waders, drops his rod and runs, screaming. Like a baby. Dr.D pics up the rod and takes over the fight. He's a man of action. As you can see, pink worm was the ticket. Brilliant chrome.    I tell death that perhaps he would not frighten people if he could take a human form. He looks weepy   Then he tells me he has a human form! I say, ""What? Why don't you use it, moron!!"" He says it's not much of an improvement. I agree, But I still ask for an autograph.   I'm dying for spring to come.  Cheers,  S."
