277437,jat,2008-12-09 14:24:00,138,I am looking to get a decent reel for ice fishing and don't want to pay too much (max $60). I have my general use reel but they seem to stick during the winter. What do you guys suggest? Thanks  I was looking at the Cardinal C104.

You decide what size to buy according to the ""specie"" your after (and what line you use.) You can even use a flyreel for deep lakers or big pike!"
277458,Curtis,2008-12-09 15:34:00,83,I have the same reel. I use it on my Ul for creekfishing and tubes for smallmouth & of course for ice fishing. I have had less trouble with it than i have with real ice fishing reels most of them get real stiff and hard to turn but no problems with this reel. I think its your best bang for your buck..  Ct
