I was wondering if anyone was familiar with the area around Brunswick and in particular St. Simons sound and Sea Island. I have only done limited Surf fishing with very good success but want to get some advice from all of you. I know the basics, and have had a heck of alot of luck using Live/Fresh dead shrimp on sliding sinker rigs/pyramid sinkers and casting into the surf, as well as off of piers. Any Help on the area or techniques would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance all!"
277407,Greencoachdog,2008-12-09 12:16:00,8163,"Not familiar with the area Bill, but use the same method you used last time (but you may need a heavier sinker at this time of year). Try using a live Pinfish (if you can get some) hooked thru the lips for a big Redfish, Black Drum, or maybe even a Striper!!!"
277604,huntervasili,2008-12-09 21:28:00,1604,"Thanks Glen, I will give it a try. Are any of the baitfish you can catch on sabiki's and such any good for bait?"
277686,bassman,2008-12-09 23:28:00,384,Tip your sabiki with bits of meat or squid for quick bait catching action. If the pinfish are around you'll have a dozen in no time.
277689,Greencoachdog,2008-12-09 23:32:00,8163," Yup! those are the ones I'm talkin' about Bill... bait each Sabiki hook on the rig with a little piece of shrimp or squid and they'll hit it faster if they're around. The Pinfish look a lot like Bluegill in their body shape, you might catch some Sardine type lookin fish too... they're Alewives or Pilchards and they're good bait too!"
