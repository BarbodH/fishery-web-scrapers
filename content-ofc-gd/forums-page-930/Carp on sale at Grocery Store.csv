277398,Greencoachdog,2008-12-09 11:19:00,8163,"  ... and if you'd read a little further down the page you'd have found this:  Decline of the glasseels   Glasseel No one yet knows the reasons, but beginning in the mid-1980s, glasseel arrival in the spring dropped drastically — in Germany to 10% and in France to 14% of their previous levels — from even conservative estimates. Data from Maine and other North American coasts showed similar declines, although not as drastic.  In 1997 European demand for eels could not be met for the first time ever, and dealers from Asia bought all they could. The traditional European stocking programs could not compete any longer: each week the price for a kilogram of glasseel went up another US$30. Even before the 1997 generation hit the coasts of Europe, dealers from China alone placed advance orders for more than 250,000 kg, some bidding more than $1,100 per kg. Asian elvers have sold in Hong Kong for as much as $5,000 to $6,000 a kilogram at times when $1,000 would buy the same amount of American glasseels with gunfights at their catching sites. Such a kilogram, consisting of 5000 glasseels, may bring at least $60,000 and as much as $150,000 after they leave an Asian fish farm. In New Jersey over 2000 licences for glasseel catch were issued and reports of 38 kg per night and fisherman have been made, although the average catch is closer to 1 kg.  The demand for adult eels has continued to grow, as of 2003[update]. Germany imported more than $50 million worth of eels in 2002. In Europe 25 million kg are consumed each year, but in Japan alone more than 100 million kg were consumed in 1996. As the European eels become less available, worldwide interest in American eels has increased dramatically.  New high-tech eel aquaculture plants are appearing in Asia with detrimental effects on the native Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica. Traditional eel aquaculture operations rely on wild-caught elvers, but experimental hormone treatments in Japan have led to artificially spawned eels. Eggs from these treated eels have a diameter of about 1 mm, and each female can produce 2 to 10 million eggs  You blame the Chinese solely for the decline and that's just isn't true!  Your bias may be considered offensive to some readers on this board."
277451,Rich,2008-12-09 15:11:00,3927,I dont even know what a glasseel is.. I was talking about American eels.
277455,Stoty,2008-12-09 15:19:00,2910,ummm...I don't care how good it tastes....I wouldnt eat something that feeds off the bottom of lakes/rivers. NASTY!

277588,Greencoachdog,2008-12-09 20:42:00,8163," So was I.  Glasseel is the larval stage of the American and European Eel while it is still in the ocean before it reaches it's freshwater estuaries, then it starts taking on color once it reaches freshwater and becomes a juvenile eel or Elver. When the Elvers grow up and reach sexual maturity, they swim back into the ocean and take on a silvery color and are called Silver Eels.... but they are all the American or European eel."
277841,pikehunter,2008-12-10 11:26:00,1659,Sooooo....some don't want to eat anything that is a bottom feeder or is part of an animal's mouth but will eat sausages encased in a pig's intestines. Interesting.

276228,Rich,2008-12-06 13:20:00,3927,"Numbers are in decline because every eel in the world spawns in the same spot. Some swim north, some swim south, some immediately enter ports to the west. The Chinese were harvesting the eels from this spawning area every year. You keep killing off the breeding hole every year and well.. bye bye eels.  Anywho, I've tried it smoked, fried, baked.. never could stand the stuff!"
276236,Greencoachdog,2008-12-06 13:40:00,8163, That statement is in error... you may want to read this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel_life_history  Fried Eel... not so good... baked and smoked is delicious
276323,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-06 18:16:00,835,"WE did up an eel  on a fishing trip once , put it on a spit over the fire and the oil dripping off the eel will keep the fire going. It was actually pretty good.  My uncle used to sell carp to  restaurants, they would take the small ones and pass them off as halibut. This would be around late forties."
276333,highdrifter,2008-12-06 18:27:00,2534," You have a pretty refined palet dawg..  Smoked eel, wrapped in sea weed over sushi rice...  Believe they call it Unagi..  OOH BABY.  Like Oprah on a baked ham..  Lunch has been decided.  NOICE. HD"
276341,wuchikubo,2008-12-06 18:40:00,1114," Bbq'd eel (Unagi) with sauce is very tasty and good for the body.  They are a bit hard to prepare initially, but once you get the hang of it it's like filleting any other fish. I wouldn't eat any of the eels from China a the moment as they've been fed things that shouldn't be eaten. If memory serves me correct the American eels was taken off the list of harvestable fish as it helps in controlling an invasive species in the great lakes.  Deep fried in Chinese 5 spice is tasty too, not like other fried methods.  Never even thought about lamprey until I read that insert by hammercarp.  That's an interesting read.  Stan"
276715,Rich,2008-12-07 17:40:00,3927," The spawning grounds for the two species are in an overlapping area of the southern Sargasso Sea, with A. rostrata apparently being more westward than A. anguilla, and with some some spawning by the American eel possibly even occurring off the Yucatan Peninsuala outside of the Gulf of Mexico, but this has not been confirmed. After spawning in the Sargasso Sea and moving to the west, the leptocephali of the American eel exit the Gulf Stream earlier than the European eel and begin migrating into the estuaries along the east coast of North America between February and late April at an age of about one year and a length of about 60 mm.  From your article..?"
