277201,Leecher,2008-12-08 22:52:00,7832,"Guys, here's another one of my creation but those were built some time ago.  I've always like to play cribbage and somehow got intrigue into making my own.  It's a long process drilling all the holes and countersink them with a special drill bit but it's rewarding when you get to play on your own creation  Here a pic of a few    For my futur project, would like to build a table for the living room so that when we get guests, can play on it but this one is going to take some thinking in the making Hope you enjoy Leechman"
277208,misfish,2008-12-08 23:13:00,29133,Love the game. Was taught by my uncle and never forgot it.  Nice job J

277237,Greencoachdog,2008-12-08 23:58:00,8163,Looks great Jacques!!!  ... you could go blind drilling all those itty bitty holes!
277253,Leecher,2008-12-09 00:22:00,7832, Thanks Brian.... Mom and dad were part of a cribbage club and was fortunate to learn from them.... Love the game also   You've said it.... a great game   Thanks DanielM   Thanks Glen.... Yeah I know what you are talking about
277375,Ron,2008-12-09 04:20:00,1683,"Love the game!  I remember the first time I played against my neighbour. He said ""You know, I've only lost playing crib once in my life, and even then the guy cheated!"" ha ha ha, I'll never forget that from his voice, may he rest in peace."
277387,bigugli,2008-12-09 05:46:00,6138,"Seems my fave crib score  is usually ""19"" when I have the crib"
277422,corvette1,2008-12-09 13:15:00,1765,great looking board you should have home field advanage
277433,lew,2008-12-09 13:41:00,12767,"Jacque, my old grandfather was a fanatic at crib and would take on all comers, but as the years progressed and his eyesight began to fade with age, it got harder for him to see the holes and insert the pegs, so my dad built him a 4' long board on legs with 1/8"" x 2"" pegs.  It sat about 2' high, just like a coffee table, and him and his old buds could then sit for hours and enjoy the game.  Great stuff"
277439,mistyriver1,2008-12-09 14:25:00,600,Great job Leechman.  My wife and I used to play years ago when we would go camping after we got the kids to sleep.  I haven't played in so long I think I've forgotten how.
277443,Mike Pike,2008-12-09 14:46:00,1332,"Hey Leechman, no need to apologize for the posts showing off your handywork.  A lot of us quite enjoy 'em.  Must be very satisfying to create works like that( and your tip ups ).  Cheers Bud."
277454,shane,2008-12-09 15:17:00,652,I learned how to play crib when I worked at the army base here in London playing againts the army guys.  I lost 5 to 10 bucks a week from my pay-cheque for the whole time I worked there.  Do you know it's legal to steal points from your opponent if he doesn't count them?
277681,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-09 23:14:00,2038,"Yep,Last creation for sure ,,Because starting this weekend it will be Ice Fishing reports from now on    "
277735,Fisherman,2008-12-10 00:49:00,7201,"Yup, if he can't add, to bad, so sad...."
277740,Leecher,2008-12-10 01:02:00,7832," Thanks Ron    I remember my first game, was against my cousin and everytime a hand was dealt, I'd sneak out to see my mom for advice.... but thanks not cheating   Thanks Bruce    yeah I know what you mean, gold old 19   Thanks corvette1   Thanks Lew     That's the sort of thing I want to build next but will also have drawers to put away the cards and pegs and cup holders for refreshments.  I want the pegs to be made out of metal and each hole will contain a round magnet so that when you position it over top will hold"
277747,Leecher,2008-12-10 01:11:00,7832," Thanks mistyriver    Playing cribbage is the same as riding a bike, you never completely forget   Thanks Mike Pike    Very rewarding   Yeah I know what you mean..... my cousin always played that way and when you tell your score and put down the cards, then your opponent is allowed to take those points that you missed but must prove it to you so that you can see where the extra points comes from   OK Paul.... I guess we won't be playing much cribbage when we hit the ice"
