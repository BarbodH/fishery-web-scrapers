The man went    to the front desk and asked for a room. He said,    ""This here is a very special, it's our wedding night,    and we need a good room with a strong bed.""    The clerk winked and asked, ""Do you want    the Bridal?""    The Cowboy thought about it a while and then    replied, ""No, I guess not, I'll just hold on    to her ears until she gets used to it."""
