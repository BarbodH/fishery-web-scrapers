277516,Pondo,2008-12-09 18:14:00,36,A banner year for sure Bunk but I think I said the same last year  .  Living vicariously through you is all good though.  Well done Sir! The girls are sure growing fast!

277587,solopaddler,2008-12-09 20:42:00,8605,"Very nice Drew. Would have liked to have read the version you lost, that's too bad. (Happened to me last month after spending 6hrs typing. Almost had a stroke on the spot, so I can relate  )"

277733,Cudz,2008-12-10 00:47:00,2652,"That report was off the hook (sorry about the pun). Incredible!!! Pics of the Char were awesome. Pics after the fishing report were sick. Wow! Like Urban said, there is no chance of me doing a 2008 round up after seeing that.  lol  Congrats!"
277786,msp,2008-12-10 02:25:00,1336,"Moosebunk , Thanks for taking the time to show us your adventures abound. Its nice to see that your family is included in the adventures from time to time.You have a beautifull family.

277427,lew,2008-12-09 13:25:00,12767,"Moose, you have an amazing talent for telling stories, and when you combine that with your skills at fishing & photography, your posts are always a favorite of mine. I know their gonna be a long, enjoyable read so I always set them aside till early the next morning and enjoy them with my morning cuppa, and you never disappoint.  Thanks for all your fantastic adventure tales over the years"
277431,Mike Pike,2008-12-09 13:39:00,1332,"I'm setting aside some time later on at home too just to enjoy fully your tales and pics, Moosebunk.  I guess that's why I don't buy fishing mags anymore.  lol  Tremendous advertures, Moosebunk, and I just wonder how you're able to get it all in!  Thank you for sharing with the rest of us.  Wow!"
