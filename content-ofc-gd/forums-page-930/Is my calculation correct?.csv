277935,JohnF,2008-12-10 17:47:00,3494," That's why I wondered about putting the gov't funding into the legacy program support (pensions, health ins, etc) instead of giving it to the companies that will quite likely finally declare chapter eleven or whatever and forfeit on all the bailout debt anyway. The gov't allowed the problem with the pensions and so on to evolve because they did't require the Big 3 to fund the plans properly in the first place. If the Big 3 had been required to properly fund the pensions and health plans as they accumulated they might have avoided or at east better anticipated the problem they now have.  That would address the problem that would otherwise arise for the innocent victims. As for the industry infrastructure breakdown, I figger the market for new vehicles won't go away completely, so why not let smarter operators like Frank Stronach and some Asians pick up the existing manufacturing facilities, suppliers, and labour force and run the industry more efficiently. Might suck for the unions to have to deal with tougher employers but at least there will still be jobs for those who actually wanna work.  JF"
277979,JohnAB,2008-12-10 19:56:00,178,I say let them go under. I pay taxes is this country and I do not want them going to some companies where the CEO is getting $9 million in bonuses and flying around in some corporate jet. The Big 3 have to learn to build a quality vehicle in a price range people can afford.
278022,Chris,2008-12-10 22:17:00,405,"So let me get this straight...... I own my own business (in operation for almost 20 years now) and make less than an assembly line autoworker. I have no pension or benefits. I went to post secondary school to get into my trade and have had to continually upgrade my skills (at my own expense) to keep up with the times and to stay in business. I won't even qualify for pogey if work dries up. Several of the factories here in Eastern Ontario that I used to get work from have closed....none of them received any kind of bailout. I'm talking Nestle's, Domtar etc, etc all big companies......not a dime from the feds or McGuilty. After saving up for what seemed like an eternity we finally had enough money and went out and bought a brand new Buick. The thing turned out to be a piece of crap from day one and neither the dealership nor GM could care less abut the problems I had with the car.....their warranty ain't worth the paper it's wriiten on.  And now as a taxpayer I'm expected to keep these guys employed. Sorry but all the crying in the world ain't gonna influence me.  Let the big three fall. That's what happens when you charge to much for crappy products made by overpaid union workers."
278028,knightfisher,2008-12-10 22:47:00,237,"Here's a sane solution...    Saving the Big 3 for You and Me ...a message from Michael Moore  Wednesday, December 3rd, 2008  Friends,  I drive an American car. It's a Chrysler. That's not an endorsement. It's more like a cry for pity. And now for a decades-old story, retold ad infinitum by tens of millions of Americans, a third of whom have had to desert their country to simply find a damn way to get to work in something that won't break down:  My Chrysler is four years old. I bought it because of its smooth and comfortable ride. Daimler-Benz owned the company then and had the good grace to place the Chrysler chassis on a Mercedes axle and, man, was that a sweet ride!  When it would start.  More than a dozen times in these years, the car has simply died. Batteries have been replaced, but that wasn't the problem. My dad drives the same model. His car has died many times, too. Just won't start, for no reason at all.  A few weeks ago, I took my Chrysler in to the Chrysler dealer here in northern Michigan -- and the latest fixes cost me $1,400. The next day, the vehicle wouldn't start. When I got it going, the brake warning light came on. And on and on.  You might assume from this that I couldn't give a rat's ass about these miserably inept crapmobile makers down the road in Detroit city. But I do care. I care about the millions whose lives and livelihoods depend on these car companies. I care about the security and defense of this country because the world is running out of oil -- and when it runs out, the calamity and collapse that will take place will make the current recession/depression look like a Tommy Tune musical.  And I care about what happens with the Big 3 because they are more responsible than almost anyone for the destruction of our fragile atmosphere and the daily melting of our polar ice caps.  Congress must save the industrial infrastructure that these companies control and the jobs they create. And it must save the world from the internal combustion engine. This great, vast manufacturing network can redeem itself by building mass transit and electric/hybrid cars, and the kind of transportation we need for the 21st century.  And Congress must do all this by NOT giving GM, Ford and Chrysler the $34 billion they are asking for in ""loans"" (a few days ago they only wanted $25 billion; that's how stupid they are -- they don't even know how much they really need to make this month's payroll. If you or I tried to get a loan from the bank this way, not only would we be thrown out on our ear, the bank would place us on some sort of credit rating blacklist).Two weeks ago, the CEOs of the Big 3 were tarred and feathered before a Congressional committee who sneered at them in a way far different than when the heads of the financial industry showed up two months earlier. At that time, the politicians tripped over each other in their swoon for Wall Street and its Ponzi schemers who had concocted Byzantine ways to bet other people's money on unregulated credit default swaps, known in the common vernacular as unicorns and fairies.  But the Detroit boys were from the Midwest, the Rust (yuk!) Belt, where they made real things that consumers needed and could touch and buy, and that continually recycled money into the economy (shocking!), produced unions that created the middle class, and fixed my teeth for free when I was ten.  For all of that, the auto heads had to sit there in November and be ridiculed about how they traveled to D.C. Yes, they flew on their corporate jets, just like the bankers and Wall Street thieves did in October. But, hey, THAT was OK! They're the Masters of the Universe! Nothing but the best chariots for Big Finance as they set about to loot our nation's treasury.  Of course, the auto magnates used to be the Masters who ruled the world. They were the pulsating hub that all other industries -- steel, oil, cement contractors -- served. Fifty-five years ago, the president of GM sat on that same Capitol Hill and bluntly told Congress, what's good for General Motors is good for the country. Because, you see, in their minds, GM WAS the country.  What a long, sad fall from grace we witnessed on November 19th when the three blind mice had their knuckles slapped and then were sent back home to write an essay called, ""Why You Should Give Me Billions of Dollars of Free Cash."" They were also asked if they would work for a dollar a year. Take that! What a big, brave Congress they are! Requesting indentured servitude from (still) three of the most powerful men in the world. This from a spineless body that won't dare stand up to a disgraced president nor turn down a single funding request for a war that neither they nor the American public support. Amazing.  Let me just state the obvious: Every single dollar Congress gives these three companies will be flushed right down the toilet. There is nothing the management teams of the Big 3 are going to do to convince people to go out during a recession and buy their big, gas-guzzling, inferior products. Just forget it. And, as sure as I am that the Ford family-owned Detroit Lions are not going to the Super Bowl -- ever -- I can guarantee you, after they burn through this $34 billion, they'll be back for another $34 billion next summer.  So what to do? Members of Congress, here's what I propose:  1. Transporting Americans is and should be one of the most important functions our government must address. And because we are facing a massive economic, energy and environmental crisis, the new president and Congress must do what Franklin Roosevelt did when he was faced with a crisis (and ordered the auto industry to stop building cars and instead build tanks and planes): The Big 3 are, from this point forward, to build only cars that are not primarily dependent on oil and, more importantly to build trains, buses, subways and light rail (a corresponding public works project across the country will build the rail lines and tracks). This will not only save jobs, but create millions of new ones.  2. You could buy ALL the common shares of stock in General Motors for less than $3 billion. Why should we give GM $18 billion or $25 billion or anything? Take the money and buy the company! (You're going to demand collateral anyway if you give them the ""loan,"" and because we know they will default on that loan, you're going to own the company in the end as it is. So why wait? Just buy them out now.)  3. None of us want government officials running a car company, but there are some very smart transportation geniuses who could be hired to do this. We need a Marshall Plan to switch us off oil-dependent vehicles and get us into the 21st century.  This proposal is not radical or rocket science. It just takes one of the smartest people ever to run for the presidency to pull it off. What I'm proposing has worked before. The national rail system was in shambles in the '70s. The government took it over. A decade later it was turning a profit, so the government returned it to private/public hands, and got a couple billion dollars put back in the treasury.  This proposal will save our industrial infrastructure -- and millions of jobs. More importantly, it will create millions more. It literally could pull us out of this recession.  In contrast, yesterday General Motors presented its restructuring proposal to Congress. They promised, if Congress gave them $18 billion now, they would, in turn, eliminate around 20,000 jobs. You read that right. We give them billions so they can throw more Americans out of work. That's been their Big Idea for the last 30 years -- layoff thousands in order to protect profits. But no one ever stopped to ask this question: If you throw everyone out of work, who's going to have the money to go out and buy a car?  These idiots don't deserve a dime. Fire all of them, and take over the industry for the good of the workers, the country and the planet.  What's good for General Motors IS good for the country. Once the country is calling the shots.  Yours, Michael Moore [email protected] MichaelMoore.com  P.S.

278053,JohnF,2008-12-10 23:57:00,3494," As reviled as Moore is by many factions in America (even Canada) I get a huge charge out of how he cuts to the bone on a lot of issues. Let me go on record right now as saying that I'd bet money he could secretly care less if real honest to goodness hunters (even the Camo Cowboy from Motor City or, rest his soul, Ben Hur) wanna shoot some deer in season, or the odd skunk, or a bunch of competitive minded souls wanna shoot targets weekly to test their prowess. I think what he objects to is the unnecessary shooting of innocent school kids and office workers by yahoos who were raised to believe the gun is all powerful, and that by taking a loaded gun in hand they are suddenly rulers of the universe, and some sort of superior entity. That being said I'm not writing to offend any responsible gun owners. On the other hand any gun owning yahoo cowboy types (read irresponsible   ) can take all the offence they want.  For those who can overlook Moore's anti-gun sensationalizing I think he makes some valid observations and conclusions here. Love him or hate him, he ain't stoopid.  JF"
278268,ozaibak1,2008-12-11 15:21:00,401," No, I do not. And it's not due to lack of sympathy for the people losing their jobs. I do not think the stimulation package is sustainable, or will solve any problems even in the near-term. The bailouts only help the inept management at the very top, whether it be in the banking or auto industries. The effects do not 'trickle down'. The US bailout that was done practically at gunpoint, had the CLEAR STATEMENT that banks would use this money to lend to people, which they have not.  Same goes with the money to the auto industry. Who gets it? The crappy management that has failed in the first place. This is like giving more money to someone who keeps failing. Unfortunately, it happens very often in our society today, even before this whole mess.  A little fishing analogy: this industry is a fishing tournament. And the people who run this tournament keep rewarding the guys who are losing, and you rig the rules to make your 'buddies' who are losing benefit.  Interested in your thoughts holdfast."
277633,holdfast,2008-12-09 22:15:00,1813,Just to be clear on what your saying.  YOU DO NOT AGREE with a Stimulation Package for the Canadian Auto Industry as proposed by the three losing partys that are trying to bring down the Government of Canada. YES OR NO

Both have been reliable and I would buy either again. Although if I ever buy new again I would be considering a Honda or Toyota built right here in good old Ontario.  And...if you buy a used vehicle what difference does it make if you buy import or domestic? Either way you are not contributing to Canadian or US manufacturing.  I know far too many people that work in auto manufacturing that refuse to buy new because new cost too much!! Wow! You make them and get paid the big bucks but you don't buy what you make. How hypercritical is that? So then these same people want our government, you and I to support their over paid jobs! I don't agree with this entirely.  And one more point that confuses the whole issue. When Toyota and Honda built their plants in Ontario how much government money was given to them to sweeten the pot? With that point then are the others also due some support?  Just some random thoughts from one who can't decide which side of the coin is   right."

MADE IN CANADA. as for staements of auto workers un-educated or folks in manufacturing, check the stats. many have degrees and to even qualify for applications, tough screening is done.. goverments have allowed the downward spiralling of wages and benefits. its not workers faults or unions. put the blame where it belongs upon goverments and greedy ceo,s. i have driven foreign and big 3 vehicles. my bucks are spent on north amerrican made products.."

276668,carp-starter,2008-12-07 14:47:00,253,"Since people are comparing cars, I will inform you all about my old Honda clunker.  Date bought – May 1996. This makes it – 12 years and 7 months.  Exterior appearance – it looks like brand new and there is NO RUST anywhere.  Mileage – 178,500 km or 110,918 miles.  What I have done to the car? I have done the standard and normal maintenance like oil changes and etc.  Muffler replacement This was replaced in the spring of 2006 – more or less 10 years. Went to Mr. Muffler and I got a figure of $500.00 plus tax. I bet you that the cost would have been higher by the time all was completed. Then I called 3 Honda dealers (Burlington, Oakville and Mississauga) and I got 3 different costs. Since I was not getting anywhere with the dealers on the phone, I went to the one in Oakville. I do not know why but they suggested I go to this small (tiny) place at Dorval and Speers and I was informed they do a good job. So, I did. Their estimated and guaranteed cost was $250.00 plus tax. The funny thing is that the small place did not replace what Mr. Muffler was going to replace. I got 2 small pipes replaced. When done, I asked as to how long the pipes would last because in the past, the pipes did not last many years. I was told that they would last because they are stainless steel pipes. My muffler nor the big tail pipe were not replaced because they both were stainless steel.  New battery replacement It was replaced in January 2006 – close to 10 years. It probably would have lasted a bit more but I did not fel like going outside on a very cold night to run the car - at 2:00am.  Brakes I had to replace the pads on the front brakes once – I do not know the date. It was done around 100,000 km. My EX used the brakes often because she liked to speed. She would accelerate even though the light at the next intersection was already RED.  After having my regular maintenance done, I was informed that I have to replace the pads on the front brakes. The back brakes are still the originals and they are still OK. This is at 178,500 km or 110,918 miles. I would say – “not bad”.  New tires I put on new set of tires in April 2008. I would say that this is good.   So, I have no reason to get rid of the Honda.  I bet you that most American cars would not be able to match my Honda in quality. Or am I wrong – I did say “most American cars?”  I am guessing but I believe my Honda will be with me 10 years from today.  carp-starter"

276708,azanier,2008-12-07 17:09:00,23,"  I remember back in '95 when my parents were looking to buy a Ford Windstar minivan. I can also remember people who supposedly knew about cars telling them that Ford's were pieces of garbage. That minivan ran with no problems up until last year when it finally started to rust.  At the same time though I knew someone who bought the exact same car (make/model/ year) and had nothing but problems with it so sometimes it all depends on the luck of the draw.

276740,Tomcat,2008-12-07 18:34:00,395,"1. The credit crisis wasn't the cause of the problems with the Big Three - it just highlighted the blight that's been there for years.  2. I don't support bailing out the Big Three and I've written my MPP to let him know my opinion. Everyone here should write their MPP, regardless which side of the fence you're on.  3. Sales staff in dealer showrooms make no where near the amount of money assembly line workers make nor do they have anything near the same benefit package. That's why we're not discussing auto sales staff.  4. There's a good possibility that one or more of the Big Three could declare bankruptcy even after US and Canadian handout loans - and then we the taxpayer really get screwed.  5. The CAW website indicates in their membership profile that 13% of its 250,000 members (or 32,500 workers) work in the major auto industry in Canada. A $6 billion bailout in Canada equates to approx $185,000 per auto worker. Obviously, there's other options than bailing out the Big Three.  6. The video on the Ford Camacarie plant in Brazil was excellent and a sign of things to come. Canadian auto workers should be getting ready for new careers as should others associated the Canadian auto industry."

276431,camillj,2008-12-06 21:37:00,1988,"My Toyota was made less than an hour from here ... so the 'import' story doesnt work for me .. and those jobs (in Ontario) matter just as much to me/us as the ones in Oshawa.  Truth is we all have a really big problem ... and this part of the Auto market (big 3) is just the tip of the iceberg ... the wholoe industry is the rest of that iceberg .. and theres a wave of other icebergs flowing through .... if we dont print the money along with the rest of the g8 we'll have a long mountain to climb to catch back up (if we ever can) ... the key is to make sure that its money well spent ... personally I like the 'guarantee' for leasing (qualified buyers) ... I like the line of credit ... and I like the equity financing ...  What lots of folks seem to forget is that right now (never mind if any of the big 3 ever get into bankrupcy) - many 'qualified' car buyers - even if they choose to buy GM FORD etc -  CANNOT get financing for their lease - this is a self-fulfilling failure  NO MATTER how much money you throw at the problem - if the buyers cant buy then the producers MUST stop producing .... or flood the lots with unsold product... and the whole thing implodes...  The solution HAS to include a means to enable (not just entice) willing 'qualified' buyers to buy... so at the very least the govt needs to get involved - I say the fastest solution - with the lowest real-dollar cost would be to offer no interest loans and allow the PST/GST costs to be income tax  deductible.  The second low-cost (real dollars) idea would be to bring back the concept of company car without the associated income tax penalty ... then small business folks will be incented to buy cars for their employees rather than pay out cash bonuses .... and in fact it is a 'no-cost' approach to the tax-payer since these are cars that otherwise will NOT BE SOLD anyways and so there would never have been a tax collected on the sale ... of course this option is only viable if there is still an auto industry left to support .. so we HAVE to do what it takes to buy the time to implement a longer term solution...I say buy the shares and control the board (the total combined market cap is something like 3 billion) ... then make the changes in the market place to make it work.    The only real caveat is for the other players/investors/workers - who will (rightly) cry foul if the playing field isn't kept level.   By the way, it strikes me that not so long ago Japan introduced legislation requiring cars to be OFF the road after a period of time (think it was 3 years) - a planned obsolescence - and built in engine for the marketplace - I am pretty sure it was introduced as part of a emissions control measure ...not sure this is the answer but it is important to understand that the producers are only one side of the equation ... the consumers (and the parameters around their consumption) are at least as important in it.   Just my 2 cents"
276457,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-06 22:34:00,10439,"  If the North Americans would stop building junk vehicles that last like the imports, get fuel mileage like the imports, were as nice to drive as the imports, Maybe, just maybe they would sell more vehicles.  I have owned Chevy's, Ford's and Chryslers as well as Honda's and my Honda's have all been much better vehicles than the American's.  And guess what They are built in Canada by Canadians!!!!!!"
