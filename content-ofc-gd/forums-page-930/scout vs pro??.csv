277606,Uncle Buck,2008-12-09 21:31:00,1000,"how big are you is the first thing  the pro is much bigger...  nice thing about the scout though is you don't need to retract/extend the poles...  same sled i believe but in the scout you sit width wise, rather then length wise like on the pro...  I like more room, mind you i'm 6'6 & 300+  factor in heater/flasher/camera/minnowbucket/cooler then decide which unit is right for you..."
