277814,Doctrt,2008-12-10 04:10:00,141,"I picked up this nice buck on a nearby trib last week.  After measuring the length at 32 3/4 inches I was convinced it was a very big fish.      After measuring the girth at 18 inches and doing so me quick math, I realized this fish would only go 13 lbs 3 oz.  Still a beauty but my weight guessing seems a bit off of late.  I could only imagine what a 43lb record bow would feel like!  I get the feeling that mark will never be bested by a wild fish.  T"
277815,Beats,2008-12-10 04:12:00,543,"Nice catch.  Fairly dark fish with great colours.  I wouldn't worry too much about its weight, it's a great catch."
277816,Leecher,2008-12-10 04:16:00,7832,Great report and pics Doctrt  The measurements alone is good enough for me.... WTG Thanks for sharing Leechman

277823,bassfighter,2008-12-10 04:39:00,366,That is a salmon pretending to be a trout. So he can flirt with all other female trout.  What a size! Great catch!
277894,kemper,2008-12-10 15:59:00,2232,"Very chunky fish, my PB is longer than that by quite  a bit but I am sure that fish outweighs it. They never seem to weigh as much as you would think haha  great fish"
277896,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-10 16:01:00,1362,Nice size Bow for sure!!...congrats!
277970,super dave,2008-12-10 19:39:00,323,Hold the fish out when taking a picture and the weight jumps to 17lbs.
