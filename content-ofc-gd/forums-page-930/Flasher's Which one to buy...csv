277487,Curtis,2008-12-09 16:56:00,83,Hi guys.  I was just wondering if i could get some feedback on what kind of flasher to purchase. I have my mind set on a vexlair but they are so exspensive. I am not looking to spend much more than $300 can i even get one for that price?? Anyways any help and advice would be greatly appreciated..  CT
277488,Beats,2008-12-09 17:07:00,543,I have a Marcum Lx-5 and I love it.  I am sure this has been asked in the last few weeks.  Try doing a search to find the threads.  The brand seems to be mostly personal preference.
277490,trapshooter,2008-12-09 17:12:00,1234,"You'll be hard pressed to get a new vex for $300.  The FL8 is about $350 and they go up from there.  Marcum is similarly priced as the vex's.  The best markum is nearly $600.  The Humminbird ICE35 flasher is about $350  You can get this aquaview for $250 through cabelas Canada.  It is not a flasher though, rather a vertical pixel graph but it is designed for ice fishing.   Good luck."
277519,Curtis,2008-12-09 18:23:00,83,Does anyone have experiance with the bottom line fish finder. I am a little specticle of its design and how it works... I have never seen one in action that is why i ask.
277523,wallyboss,2008-12-09 18:34:00,1095,Either one of thses would be a good choice     But I have a VEX FL-18 and I love it.
277525,modny,2008-12-09 18:42:00,502,i'll get back to you  i know danbo's wife knows alot about flashing.

277534,Meely,2008-12-09 19:04:00,282,Here is my advice...... Wait until you can put aside the $350 and get a Vexilar. You will not be disappointed. I have the FL-8 model and have been using it for 3 year now. It will change how you ice fish and also make you wonder how you ever fished without one before.  Meely
277536,Curtis,2008-12-09 19:07:00,83,Thanks for the imput.. and by the way nice photo. lol  Ct
277539,iceslayer,2008-12-09 19:11:00,97,Completely agree with Meely.  Had mine for 5 years now and wont leave home without it.  Vexilar has a new site now for only icefishing and it will really help you understand the vexilar unit.  icefishtoday.com       I think..  Good luck.
277805,John Bacon,2008-12-10 03:45:00,3277," I owned an old Bottom Line TBL 300 that I bought off of Karl Kalonka before he became rich and famous  I believe it was a late eighties model.  It functioned fairly well from 1994 to 2007.  I have owned a couple of Eagles purchases brand new that did not last that long.  The power cords did have tendancy to wear out but Bottom Line replaced them free of charge.  Overall, I would say that it was good unit with great service.  I think they have been merged with Humminbird now."
