277376,Cudz,2008-12-09 04:21:00,2652,Planning to fish Simcoe on Wednesday evening if the launch is not frozen.  I probably won't get out until 7 pm.  Should be interesting.  We'll see.
277391,cram,2008-12-09 07:06:00,1733,"be careful, and wear a floater suit."
277435,Fisherman,2008-12-09 14:17:00,7201,"And what do you plan on catching at 7pm, kinda dark out."
277438,Stoty,2008-12-09 14:25:00,2910,Last time I checked....fish bit better under low-light conditions.
277483,steverowbotham,2008-12-09 16:40:00,1800," Last time I checked, that usually depends on the species' in which you are targetting, time of year, water temp etc."
277485,Stoty,2008-12-09 16:46:00,2910,"Assuming Musky/Walleye are the targets, since bass is closed....I think that's a pretty accurate statement."
277489,steverowbotham,2008-12-09 17:07:00,1800," Musky in Simcoe?  Might as well play the lottery, you'll be warmer ... I've SEEN one ... in my life"
277491,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-09 17:12:00,0,There is no season for Musky on Simcoe. I hear the Perch are bitting pretty good though.....
277492,Raf,2008-12-09 17:13:00,3495,"3 words: moratorium, regs, perch  ok a 3 bonus ones:  good luck cudz."
277605,Stoty,2008-12-09 21:30:00,2910, Then they are in there! Throw perch in there too.....they also bite pretty well in low-light conditions.  But that dude's statement was like...what do you expect to catch when its dark....
277613,bukee,2008-12-09 21:44:00,58,"From what I've been told, Simcoe is pretty much frozen over for the first few hundred feet from shore.  So, I doubt it matters what time he is going out anyway, unless he's got an argo/wilcraft.  Stay home/stay safe."
277622,misfish,2008-12-09 21:57:00,29133,"It,s a big lake. I seen waves where he,s going to head out. Ramps are snow covered. I,ll be waving from the red truck with a warm timmies.LOL Stay safe out there."
277651,Cudz,2008-12-09 22:37:00,2652,I am not going now.    The forecast changed.  I got the weather today I was hoping for tomorrow.  Maybe next monday. I will (beleive it or not) be targeting walleye.  THere have been several caught recently just outside the marina off the wall a bit.  People catching perch and the big walleye taking the perch and not letting go.  A few 10 pound plus fish.  If all else fails I was planning to catch some perch. Oh well.  Maybe monday if the water is still soft.
