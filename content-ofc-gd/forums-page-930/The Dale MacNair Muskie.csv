277992,Handlebarz,2008-12-10 20:43:00,3790,"Lew, Dale just told me today that they will have the big girl or "" Big Kahuna ""  has he calls her that is just a great fitting name for her at the Odyssey for all to see. I cant wait for that show this will be a great year last time the Obrian fish and now the MacNair monster"

277529,BillM,2008-12-09 18:44:00,17367,Sweet OFC made the article!!!!  To bad it was about people being jackasses and wasting 6 pages arguing about the size of the fish...
277533,bigfish1965,2008-12-09 19:01:00,3382,Wow...stared at that pic for a long time. What a beast!!!

Thank you to all who put it together and a special thanks to Dale MacNair for his generosity in letting everyone share his spectacular event.  Edit: I just put a post-it note over my avatar.

277575,SlowPoke,2008-12-09 20:26:00,2984,"Thanks for posting Ron! World record or not, who really cares? It's so nice to see a fish that size go back into the water. It was a shame to see the skeptics spewing and the begrudging bloviating. -Brian"
277576,Handlebarz,2008-12-09 20:28:00,3790,I bet I will have to listen to it many times over as I would get distracted when Dale was talking I would be thinking of that big girl on the end of my line and then realize that I was just listening to a story what a great recording.  Once again congratz dale.  The on line journal looks great also

277607,lew,2008-12-09 21:34:00,12767,"Excellent interview and you could hear the excitement in his voice as he re-lived the fight.  Sounds like their gonna have the reproduction done fairly fast and seeing as Dale lives in Ontario, I wonder if there's any chance he'll have it at the Musky Odyssey in April ??"
277627,Handlebarz,2008-12-09 22:08:00,3790,Lew I bet he will have it there at the MCI booth that will bring alot of people over and be great to here the story all day long. I just hope he does not do the carp show in Ottawa if its the same weekend that would really suck if I find out I will let ya know here
