Always great service, warm bungalows, and the fish are there, you just have to work for them at some times of the year. Last year I was out on the opener and closer, and we got lots each time.  Good mix of keepers and slot fish, my biggest 'eye out of there is 6lbs. 2 years ago my buddy got a fat 38"" pike as we were packing up to leave. Really solid operation, you'll have a blast. Darcy"
