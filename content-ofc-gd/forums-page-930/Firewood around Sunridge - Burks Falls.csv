277904,reelinrolly,2008-12-10 16:19:00,281,I was just wondering if anyone could give me the nujmber of a place to get fire wood around burksfalls or sunridge?
277972,Billy Bob,2008-12-10 19:41:00,5865,"I can't help you as I am in the Buffalo area (east). But I will tell you they are getting crazy with the prices here. Most are asking from $80 - $120 per face cord and delivery is optional.  I paid the same as I have for the last four years, $50 per cord but I have to get it myself. It takes me 4 - 5 loads for me to bring in 6 or 8 cords every year. This year my guy, a cousin of a former co-worker said he will not be doing it after this year because the trees are worth more as timber than firewood. He has mostly hickory and some black cherry. But then my buddy said, Tommy probably will do it again next year. I hope so as his wood is the BEST by far. CLEAN, Cut, split and DRIED for one year. Here's hoping as I heat the house with wood now.  Bob"
