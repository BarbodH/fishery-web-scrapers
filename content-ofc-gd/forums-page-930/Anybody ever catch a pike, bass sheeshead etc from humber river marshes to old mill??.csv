I have stories about pike being caught, large bass, sheepshead and even gar.....  I ask because I am interested in hearing what people might have caught in that stretch, as there are some deeper sloughs by where the humber river marina is..............  thanks!"

The Humber marshes has a good population of large mouths and some pike in early spring..  Mind you, water clarity is poor most of the time, so you gotta pick your days carefully.  cheers HD"
