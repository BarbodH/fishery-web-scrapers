278385,charlesn,2008-12-11 21:14:00,551,"Reminded me of the Tyson ear biting.  Guy was expecting to beat/dominate an opponent, the opponent was doing better than expected, so the villain (Tyson/Badr) resort to unsportsmanlike conduct so that they can say they lost by DQ as opposed to ""getting beat fair and square"".  The first foul (throw/trip) was heat of the moment, the stomp was pre-meditated, the comments afterwards the clear sign of a sore loser."
278391,danbo,2008-12-11 21:22:00,2646,I totally agree! Badr is a goon!
278397,Bitsmith2k,2008-12-11 21:35:00,396," what comments did he make afterwards? didnt hear or read anything about it.. regardless, he's a bone head.."
278401,charlesn,2008-12-11 21:39:00,551,"He call Remy a ""good actor"" implying that the foot stomp didn't cause the double vision and dizziness that Remy claimed.  I guess he thinks Remy took an ""easy out"" instead of getting back up and shaking it off.  Remy had a good idea, if Badr thinks it was acting, maybe before a rematch he can allow Remy to stomp his head.  lol"
