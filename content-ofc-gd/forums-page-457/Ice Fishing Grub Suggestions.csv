650977,Rod Caster,2011-12-26 01:58:00,5784,"With the impending shiner shortage this year I will rely on soft-plastics more than even. I have a few go-to soft plastics such as the ones below but I'd like to add to my walleye/Perch arsenal with your help. Thanks ahead for suggesting your favorites. 3"" Gulp Shaky Shad http://www.basspro.com/Berkley-Gulp!-Alive!-Pogy/product/96071/139128  Yum Walleye Grubs http://www.basspro.com/Yum-F2-Walleye-Grubs/product/10222546/91181  Bassassin Walleye Assassins http://www.bassassas...es/CAT-E71D114/"
650986,EC1,2011-12-26 02:41:00,930,"I'm always one that wants to try baits that no one around me will be using. (And it usually doesn't pay off, but I continue to do it )  In terms of swimbait tailed grubs, I'd look into the   X Zone Swammer - Canadian and I've seen some pretty good results on the ice with them.  Reaction Innovations Little Dipper - Looks good, I might try it next year.  For normal grubs, I never really use them at all (Maybe once or twice a year) and the Yum grubs have been more than fine with me.  How do you plan on rigging these through the ice? I want to try these on a scrounger head, but haven't even tried them out over softwater. If that doesn't work out, I'll be trying it on a normal jighead."
650994,Rod Caster,2011-12-26 03:15:00,5784," I forgot to mention that... typically I just use 1/4, 3/8 or 1/8 oz normal jig heads, nothing fancy. I buy my jig heads from Gramps near Temagami. He carries some good quality jigs with good colors...and throws in a few free ones if you buy a lot.  Good suggestion with the Swammer I'll have to pick some up next time I'm at Rack and Reel in Barrie. I'm really impressed with the Slammer model... by far my most successful bait on a dropshot.  The Keitech look great as well. Thanks!"
651008,Leecher,2011-12-26 04:45:00,7832,"Chad, when I'm not using frozen minnows (salties), I always tip any of the lures I use with Gulp fish fry... chartreuse or white works great for perch and walleye"

651027,Harrison,2011-12-26 14:47:00,2202,"Berkley Gulp and powerbaits are very popular for walleye and perch through the ice.  Fish Frys, minnow heads, power minnows, trout worms, maggots etc. Sample of some of these baits here.  Swammers are another plastic that was used through the ice last year by some of his field staff (gents I know) and they did well with lakers, whities and walleye.  I've sold a few of them to some guys I know who are die hard Quinte guys for the eyes.  I used to use the FinS minnow for perch alot too.  Good Luck Rod!"
651031,Rod Caster,2011-12-26 15:23:00,5784, Fin S http://www.tackledirect.com/lunker-city-fin-s-lures.html They look similar to the Walleye Assassins.  I'm definitly going to try the Swammers... the Slammers impressed me for bass and Canadian made is a bonus.  Thanks Harrison!!  Going out to check the ice on Nosbonsing right now... if it's solid hopefully I'll get my first perch of the ice season.
651032,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-26 15:25:00,2582,Another vote for FinS minnows here. Can't go wrong with Arkansas shiner for a color choice. I however use the FinS shad bodies...1.5 inch size through the ice for perch & crappie. The larger sizes will probably work just as well for larger fish.
