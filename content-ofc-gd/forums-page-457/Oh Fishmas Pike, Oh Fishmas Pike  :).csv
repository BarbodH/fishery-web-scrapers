No giants but we did catch a bunch with 2 really decent sized ones plus we lost a couple of really good ones. Ice thickness.............15"" of good black ice. I'll let the pictures tell the story. Enjoy!!                "

651275,Skud,2011-12-28 00:54:00,739,Sweet pike Dave. Looks like you are continuing to shrink away. How much weight have you lost now?
651277,Rod Caster,2011-12-28 00:56:00,5784,Good stuff Dave. Nice pike! It's getting cold here finally...
651297,Rizzo,2011-12-28 01:44:00,4754,I would take those pike any day through the ice
