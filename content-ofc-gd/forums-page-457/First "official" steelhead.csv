So I got a few bass pro shop gift cards for xmas and decided to invest in a good quality noodle rod for steelheading as I am hooked!  I headed up there today to check out some rods and ended up buying the okuma aventa 15.6 foot rod for 109.99.  I got back at around 1 and thought id head down to the creek to play with my new toy.  After a few drifts my float goes down and im into a fish.  A nice fat bellied fresh hen with plenty of fight in her, taking to the air a few times, is on the end of my line.  After a 10 minute struggle with a 3# leader she was in the net of a fellow angler, and I was able to finally get a pic of these magnificent fish after the only other one I landed broke off my leader and swam away before i could get the hook out and snap a pic.  After a quick pic she was back in the water and darted back into the deep water in seconds.  I lost another fish due to a birds nest in my reel and decided to call it a day after that as it was getting dark.  All in all a great few hours on the water Im hoping to get out every day until closer and will hopefully have much more fish porn to share!! lol  thanks for reading, Mike "
