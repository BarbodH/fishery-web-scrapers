650659,Michael_Brown,2011-12-24 01:59:00,411,Looks like Lake Scugog.  If he keeps using his spinning rod upside down it's going to blow up.
650662,BillM,2011-12-24 02:26:00,17367,"That's the way to ice fish for big lakers..  Downrigging rods and big reels, get those fish up and back in the water.  I'm guessing NWT for sure."
650666,OutdoorDan,2011-12-24 02:41:00,325," I'd bet it's a fiberglass rod, so I doubt anything will happen to it.  These videos are really making me hate this weather!"
650674,WeedLine,2011-12-24 03:26:00,322,It's Cold Lake Alberta. I love this vid. There's a part 2 as well.

650715,captpierre,2011-12-24 14:58:00,2521,Wow!  If Ice fishing were like that here even I would do it.

651084,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-27 00:29:00,26,WOW now thats awesome ice fishing right there!
651095,Grimace,2011-12-27 01:24:00,2020,Great video.  Those were absolute tanks.
651281,Rizzo,2011-12-28 01:01:00,4754,man that was crazy. For the first few seconds I thought the guy was standing at the edge of the ice fishing into open water!
