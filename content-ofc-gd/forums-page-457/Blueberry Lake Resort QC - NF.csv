She rented a cottage and invited us over for Christmas eve dinner and a sleep over   Guess what was on the menu???  Yep!!! deer bourgignon with brussel sprouts and mash sweet patatoes and garden salad  Destination, Blueberry Lake Resort in Labelle QC, just 30 some kilometres past Mont Tremblant... Paradise on earth if you ask me    I was anxious to see what was waiting ahead, the plan was for my brother to pickup my mom and meet us at my house, then leave on our journey... 2h 30 minutes later we got to destination... up there the scenery was all white, a beautiful place  The cottage, well I shouldn't say that, more like a mansion if you ask me... I'll let the pics do the talking  Here is the kitchen as we got in    Dinning room      Me and mom    Closer shot    Looking at the cathedral ceiling, front view    Gifts    Fire place and decorations    My sister up above on the second floor    Shots from above    Brother in law waving down below    Mélissa and her cousins snacking    One of the 3 washrooms    One of the 4 bedrooms    Basement, entertainment room with pool table, lots of shots                Needless to say, that area is enormous  Now the hot tub.... outside   My brother and Mélissa    Mélissa    Couple more      The next morning it was snowing when I got up and took a few shots from the side porch  The lake      Front porch view    Did not manage to get shots from the outside main entrance but you can always go to the following link to see  Blueberry Lake Resort  All in all was a great time    The trip back home took 3h 30 mintues due to a snow storm and the roads were slippery.  Once arrived we had to prepare for another gathering at my sister in law for Christmas dinner.  All this to say that this is a moment in life that we soon not forget Again best wishes to all for the holiday season Tight lines Leechman"
