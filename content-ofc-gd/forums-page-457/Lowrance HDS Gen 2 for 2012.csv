646194,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 17:36:00,8333,Makes you wonder what is next eh.
646211,Dan668,2011-12-07 18:23:00,1120,"So do i get a discounted 8 or buy a gen 2 hds 8 to go with my hds 7, tough decision"
646219,scugpg,2011-12-07 18:39:00,1373," I'd buy a new one if it were me, the speed improvement alone should be worth it IMO.  You never know, maybe the pricing will be good."
646222,craigdritchie,2011-12-07 18:43:00,1586,"Good chance that website is going to land in hot water for that. Lowrance has an embargo on that info till December 15. Not sure where they got it from, but someone's getting a letter from the lawyers."
646233,Dan668,2011-12-07 19:23:00,1120,Bass pro leaked it on their own site and catalogue
646234,Roy,2011-12-07 19:25:00,13728,"Craig, BPS has them and the specs on their online catalogue.  I saw them there very early this morning."
646251,craigdritchie,2011-12-07 19:58:00,1586,"You know, stuff like this is precisely why I lost any and all respect for the fishing tackle industry. They make you agree to not write about this or that till a specific date, then it's in someone's catalogue a day later. Honestly .... it is an industry that survives in spite of its own best efforts."
646254,kickingfrog,2011-12-07 20:09:00,8333,Someone hit send to all in thier email list?  Frustrating I am sure.
646263,Wolf 3,2011-12-07 20:45:00,134,I heard about these new units last Friday. Here is a link with a screen shot. http://www.bbcboards.net/zerothread?id=748574
646280,Billy Bob,2011-12-07 21:58:00,5865,"When they make new units that make the fish bite, especially on those very difficult days....then I will buy a new one..."
646302,beertech,2011-12-07 23:09:00,118,so what basicly do these do over the old units.  Is it mainly an upgrade if you use structure scan or want to save data
646360,RickOnt,2011-12-08 02:37:00,669,This HNS Gen 2 info has been out for about a week!!  Kinda coincided with the Ptice Drop and Rebate on the current HDS Units.  Rick  So Now who has the  Best price on a Gen 2 HDS-7??
646553,Wolf 3,2011-12-08 22:49:00,134,"For those interested, here is a video on the new HDS Gen2 units.  http://www.lowrance.com/Products/Marine/HDS-Gen2/"
646944,Dan668,2011-12-10 00:11:00,1120,Looks like ill be getting a gen 2. Do you guys find structure scan on the console or bow more effective? My older unit will be going on the opposing spot without structure scan.
646951,Wolf 3,2011-12-10 00:33:00,134, Here's one. http://www.hydrowave.com/index.htm
647020,Billy Bob,2011-12-10 10:41:00,5865, Looks like PURE Quackery to me.....
650500,Nipfisher,2011-12-23 03:41:00,2449,What would be a good price on a used HDS-8 that is 2 years old (no winter use)? My buddy is upgrading to the Gen2 and will sell his to me for a decent price. What do you all think? New they are still advertised for $1600.
650508,Dan668,2011-12-23 04:24:00,1120," At the time of sale, from the states they could be had for 1399 +200 rebate. So 1200 new"
650509,Nipfisher,2011-12-23 04:27:00,2449,  I was going off of Radioworld prices on line.   What is a good price for oner used?
650513,HTHM,2011-12-23 04:37:00,4082,"What ever YOU think is a fair deal for the both of you. A good price would be 300 a great price would be 100 a FANTASTIC price would be 20. A fair price, that is between you and him."
650516,ah_long,2011-12-23 05:49:00,354,"I bought my HDS7 and 8 a week before they put out the new Gen 2  but the more I think about it, I'm not losing too much... I do have the LSS-1 bundled with the HDS-8 and boy did I get a good deal on it on top of the rebate..  the structure map functionality is nice but it boils down to what species and lakes you're doing...  to my understanding, it's better to put the LSS-1 ducer @ the back, mark the structure you want to fish and use the sonar and GPS up at the bow to fish"
651149,scugpg,2011-12-27 15:09:00,1373,"Here's an interesting video on the speed comparison. Gen2 is way faster but his Gen1 looks really slow, I've never seen one perform that slow on the water or in a store though. Maybe with structurescan running it slows it right down?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6vT2OAth7E"
