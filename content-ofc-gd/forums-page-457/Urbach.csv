It looks like an intersting lake to ice fish.  I""m not looking for a honey hole just looking for general impression/opinion of the lake. cheers all!"
651127,OutdoorDan,2011-12-27 10:54:00,325,Are you talking about the one near Apsley?  I don't think you're going to get much about such a small lake on a public forum...
