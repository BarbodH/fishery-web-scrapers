651246,Raf,2011-12-27 23:51:00,3495,the gall of someone to post a fishing report on a fishing board.  this is not wrapmyselfupinbubblewrap.com.  do you even fish bob?
651248,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 23:55:00,5865," See, that's the thing Mike....I do trust my experience, since I have over a decade more than  you do....as a matter of fact I was ice fishing in high school before you were born....  BTW and please correct me if I'm wrong....aren't you the same Mike Brown that has a financial stake in one of the Kawarthan Lakes...maybe it was Rice Lake  ? ? ?  P.S. I'm not offended in anyway.....just trying to keep inexperience safe through another ice fishing season....  Bob"
651251,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 23:58:00,5865,  LOL....do you...
651255,bushart,2011-12-28 00:12:00,2628,funny---steelheaders won't post in case somebody takes their spots---so there is an assumption lurkers are out there trying to fast-track the experience curve  How can that same logic not be applied in unsafe ice fishing--talking from experience--some times youthful enthusiasm and excitement will cloud safe judgement.
651257,skeeter,2011-12-28 00:16:00,1907," BOB how dare you give your opinion on an open discussion board. Maybe they should put that in the rules, but that's just my opinion."
651258,mercman,2011-12-28 00:18:00,7054,"Bob may come accross as a redneck, but there is nothing redneck about him. If he thought it wise to post his opinion on the ice thinckness, then i am sure he felt it was the right thinkg to do. Not a jab at the OP, just a warning for new and younger ice fishing enthusiats, to be patient until ma nature is sure what she is gooing to do about the ice. Having that opinion backed up by a wise and respected founder of this forum should be enough to validate it."
651284,206,2011-12-28 01:06:00,563,"Got out today as well, buddy took me to a lil spot i'd be surprised if the ice was 4...3 for sure we had a great day lil crappy and jumbo perch.  As a 300lbs man i was a lil nervous but stayed dry and had a blast."
651285,Michael_Brown,2011-12-28 01:08:00,411,"Your right Bob.  I have little experience in safety, ice fishing or fishing in general. Plus my opinions are clouded by running fishing festivals for families.     Sorry."
651288,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-28 01:11:00,2582,Thx for the report Michael. Glad to see someone is enjoying the ice.  I made a last ice report ONCE on another fishing board and got attacked by quit a few members as well.  Seems I was sending the uneducated to there death beds if they read my report and tried anything as foolish as fishing on 14-18 inches of ice the first week of April  I understand peoples concern.  I however have never ever even got a soaker in 30 years on the ice. I'm probably as cautious and safety minded on the ice as anyone you could possibly meet. That is the problem with a one paragraph report on an open forum. The readers where not there and don't know the current conditions or the level of caution the poster uses when they are out.  I see both sides of the story here. An ice fisherman thrilled with finally getting out and sharing his day and a few readers worried about the safety of others. A mix that always ends with a bad taste in everyone's mouth.  Sorry if they took the wind out of your sails Michael...but again congrats at getting on some ice  Don't bother with anymore first/last ice reports. Just enjoy your day and save the memories for your own scrapbook.
651301,Billy Bob,2011-12-28 02:20:00,5865, OK then......
651327,Ron,2011-12-28 08:07:00,1683,"Ok everyone,  Take a deep breath and hug amongst yourselves. The area where Mike and Chris were fishing, was in deed safe ice. As Mike had posted, take it upon yourselves to what you yourself consider to be safe ice. Why someone would get flamed or crapped upon for a fishing post is beyond me. Opinions around here are like , everyone has got one, but some make the best of what they have.  Thanks for the post Mike, it has given me the option of getting off my  and checking out some lakes myself. Hope I get into some Whitefish. I will send you a PM so as not to offend the sensitive people on this board on how we make out.  Cheers, Ron..."
651331,Billy Bob,2011-12-28 10:28:00,5865,"OK everyone, I guess 3"" is now safe ice..."
651357,Court R,2011-12-28 13:36:00,213,"Nice haul Mike! was thinking about making the drive, that much ice already wow! really makes ya want to do a report with so many experts behind there computers.."
651370,Roy,2011-12-28 14:45:00,13728,This one's done but it's staying up. Thanks for everyones' input.
651066,Michael_Brown,2011-12-26 21:27:00,411,Got out on a kawartha lake today and pounded the panfish. No monsters but the action was steady. You need to extra cautious but if you find the right back bay or protected shoreline you can fish. The warm weather coming will not help but it was nice to stand on the surface again.  Chris Giles wrote a piece on our outing today.  http://www.nationalprostaff.com/report/404/First+Ice  Be careful and have fun. Kawartha's ice fishing season round 3 has begun.
651067,OutdoorDan,2011-12-26 21:45:00,325,"Great report, thanks.  Getting excited!"
651080,Rizzo,2011-12-26 23:54:00,4754,"wow I wouldn't have guessed the lakes were ready to go yet, exciting news!"
651086,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-27 00:55:00,627,"[quote name='Michael Brown' date='26 D Be careful and have fun. Kawartha's ice fishing season round 3 has begun.   So what you are saying Mike is, someone like myself should wait a month or so?"
651108,Ron,2011-12-27 03:19:00,1683," Just strap some planks on Tom.  You'll be alright then....  Cheers, Ron..."
651112,Michael_Brown,2011-12-27 03:44:00,411,"We started getting fish in 7-8 feet of water Tom, even if you went through it wouldn't be over your head.  "
651128,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 10:58:00,5865,"Wow, less then 4"" of ice....kind of foolish IMHO. Reports like this could  entice others into dangerous situations."
651129,kingofthesteelhead,2011-12-27 11:20:00,140,"call me when there is 6 inches of good ice,that's my comfort zone,after all they are only panfish!"
651130,Roy,2011-12-27 11:25:00,13728, But you'd do it for walleye?
651131,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 11:43:00,5865, I wouldn't even do it for a mere maid...
651132,ecmilley,2011-12-27 11:46:00,2163,walkin around on sturgeon no probs yesterday was around 4 inches of ice once i got off shore more than 2 ft ventured bout 100 yards till the spud went through
651141,Rizzo,2011-12-27 14:45:00,4754, ...you know you've gone too far when...
651153,oldphart,2011-12-27 15:44:00,665,"~~~This morning Web Cam shot from Reach Harbour Lower Buckhorn. Harbour frozen, but main lake wide open, for me I'm looken for open ramps to launch my boat alot safer"
651176,Michael_Brown,2011-12-27 18:46:00,411,  Everyone has different comfort levels. I think I posted a few times that caution should be used. I have no problem with 4 inches of solid black ice. I have a fairly good handle on my safety but you should stay home until you have 24 inches IMHO.
651184,Roy,2011-12-27 19:37:00,13728," I think Bob's right on this one Mike. The problem with these things being posted on a public forum is that we have youngsters reading this and even perhaps a few inexperienced adults and seeing National Pro Staff members posting about the fun they're having on 4"" of ice, well, it could send the wrong message..  Just my opinion."
651185,ecmilley,2011-12-27 19:42:00,2163,"pretty sure the mnr guidllines specify 4 inches, i was out today in 4 inches of good ice, why all the alarm if you don't feel comfortable don't go"
651188,Roy,2011-12-27 19:50:00,13728," Just my opinion, Ernie."
651190,ecmilley,2011-12-27 20:02:00,2163,"to day at 1:30 pm south shore sturgeon lake, i was running around checking thickness and looking for some decent weeds, wife took this: "
651192,Roy,2011-12-27 20:04:00,13728,That's great. Looks like it's getting ready.
651201,Skipper D,2011-12-27 20:37:00,1970,If you can do what you want out there and stay out of the news then i feel better .
651204,bushart,2011-12-27 20:44:00,2628,Good Tip there Roy---Kids and the inexperienced should stay away till it's been cold for an extended period with safer conditions  4 inches in one place could be half an inch very nearby---no fish in this world worth lookin up at the bottom of the ice for.  some may see this on the board here and not know about things like creek flows---neck down areas etc.
651217,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 21:24:00,5865," I think you need to go back and read your own post and your partner's post also....as nowhere did you mention 4 inches of solid black ice, but Chris Giles did post at NationalProStaff.com that there was ""about 3 inches of ice with one open spot that we could see off in the distance""....this in dangerous ice fishing not only IMHO but by many other veterans as well....  When I read your OP my first thought was exactly as Roy posted....there are many young and experienced anglers here and I for one would feel horrible if something would happen to one because they ventured out on thin ice after reading a report like this.....and I'm sure you would too....but if your more interested in taking shots at me, go ahead....I'm a Redneck who has pretty good aim when I shoot back....  Bob"
651225,OutdoorDan,2011-12-27 21:59:00,325,"In Michael's defence, he mentioned more than once to be extremely careful and take the proper precautions.  I do agree that reports of fishing on thin ice has the potential of leading to inexperienced people taking unnecessary risks, but at the same time reports like this are needed on a fishing forum and he presented the report in a responsible way."
651239,Michael_Brown,2011-12-27 23:16:00,411," Pretty sure I responded to your first shot at me Bob. Reply button is not mandatory.    Stay off the ice or open water, wear a seat belt, life jacket, helmet and have 911 on speed dial. Don't trust your experience or common sense. Be safe.  I'm done, moving on to another topic. Feel free to lock this post so as not to offend anyone else."
651245,Billy Bob,2011-12-27 23:45:00,5865," Yep, read that part also....it can be interpreted by some (young and inexperienced ice anglers) as ""be careful on unsafe ice"". That is why I responded as I did on my very first post....  Are unsafe risk reports like this needed on a fishing forum....well, again ""IMHO"" as I believe that what this forum is about, ""opinions""....then I again would say ""NO""."
