649567,Billy Bob,2011-12-19 19:49:00,5865,As others here I have some family traditions we do at Christmas time and something everyone asks if I will be making it again this year....especially by visiting out of town family....so I thought I would share it here if anyone is interested...it's super easy to make but should be made at least 3 days or more before consuming it...make it in a carafe if you have one and place it in fridge and shake every so often...and don't forget to eat the fruit as it good for you....LOL...you will find many folks that never would drink whiskey ask for a second one... ...Merry Christmas...   CANDY WHISKEY DRINK  1 Pint of WHISKEY ¼ lb of String Rock Candy 6 Maraschino Cherries 6 Chunks of Pineapple in HEAVY Syrup 4 Slices of Oranges 4 Slices of Lemons 2 Teaspoons of Cherry Juice 2 Teaspoons of Pineapple Juice  This is only a guide……I have always doubled or tripled the above ingredients because I try to use a liter of Whiskey. The more stuff in it the better.
