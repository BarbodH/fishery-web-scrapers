Jack is now 3 months away from his 3rd birthday....and while last year he kinda got the whole xmas thing...this year he totally got what it was about.....it was the best feeling in the world to see his little face light up opening presents, the excitement in his voice all day, the look of disbelief and joy when he was allowed to eat candy and chocolate at will in large amounts...priceless.    Here are some pics from xmas and boxing day.............                                                              Hope you enjoyed those....now i have 4 days of work...then 2 days chasing Lakers and Whitefish!!!!!  Happy new year to you all,  Simon."
