651196,Spiel,2011-12-27 20:25:00,9065," My Brook was just the same when I saved her Bruce but she's one happy dog now, spoiled rotten! Good on you for giving Molly a new outlook on life. Big applause."
651345,Jewelbee,2011-12-28 11:50:00,422, Brook? Spoiled? NOOOOO LOL!
650781,bigugli,2011-12-24 19:56:00,6138,"It's been like a morgue here the past week, since Peanut's passing. I needed a walking companion, and we needed some life back in our home. Even our 16 year old, Lucky, has done nothing but whine and whimper. We decided to visit a local dog rescue to give someone a fresh start at life, just as we had done for Lucky. Here is Molly.   She is a 3 year old hound that is friendly if a bit skittish, but so was our other rescue dog at first. She certainly has energy. We'll just have to see if she retrieves fish.  Merry Christmas Hyvaa Joulua  Thank you again for all your warm thoughts."
650783,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-24 19:59:00,2582,So happy to see this my friend. Happy Holidays. Molly looks like a fine family Christmas gift to me  :thumbsup_anim:

650841,ckrb2007,2011-12-24 23:57:00,449,"A great Christmas present not only for you and your family, but for the dog as well!! Congrats!"
650857,Loonietoon,2011-12-25 01:03:00,1450,Good for you Bruce & Merry Christmas to you and your family... I know it will not replace Peanut but it will help fill the void..
650862,motion,2011-12-25 01:40:00,403,Good on you Bruce for helping out the little pooch. Molly looks like she is going to be a great walking companion. My Toby keeps me young. Merry Christmas and enjoy your new friend.  Cheers!

650894,woodenboater,2011-12-25 06:20:00,2277,"ha ha, already looks at home on the sofa  Gotta love beagles and agree with others on your move to get a rescue !  merry christmas and have a happy new year, with your new walking buddy"
650896,Rich Clemens,2011-12-25 11:00:00,3131,Great to see this and providing just one dog a chance for a long and happy life.
650900,Jewelbee,2011-12-25 11:58:00,422,What a wonderful thing to do!!!!! Peanut is smiling down on you.. I'm sure Merry Christmas
650904,Big Cliff,2011-12-25 12:53:00,6899,"Oh Bruce, what a wonderful thing, Molly needed a special person to love her and you needed a Molly in your life. It truly is Christmas. Doesn't matter if she fishes or not, the most important thing is that you both need each other! All the very best to you and Molly my friend!"
650925,NAW,2011-12-25 16:19:00,4022,That's great Bruce.  Good on ya!
650931,Ralph Field,2011-12-25 17:41:00,1018,"Congratulations! We have a rescued beagle from Ohio with the same colour pattern as your dog. I'm sure you won't wear her out from walking her, as they seem to be able to go forever."
650943,bigugli,2011-12-25 18:50:00,6138,"Molly certainly settled in quick.  However, it is obvious she has been abused. She cowers whenever I pick up my cane, or when you go to throw a stick for her to fetch. She'll realize soon enough that the cane is not for hurting her."
650971,Joey,2011-12-26 00:15:00,9122,That is just awesome and Molly is one lucky dog.  Congrats on the new addition to the family!
650993,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-26 03:06:00,2582, She'll come around soon enough Bruce. I know you have the gentle patience to take her fears away. However if I where YOU....instead of the stick fetching...I'd be teaching her to retrieve fishing rods thrown in the water
650997,bigugli,2011-12-26 03:25:00,6138,Et Tu Brute   Oh so true
651006,corvette1,2011-12-26 04:32:00,1765,congrats bruce
