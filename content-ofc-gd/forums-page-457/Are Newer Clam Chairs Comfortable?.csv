650759,Oggie,2011-12-24 18:25:00,588,I've developed a really sore back (physio required) and I think it's from my Clam chair.  I noticed it right after sitting in the hut over a whole winter.  Anyone else developed a chronic sore back from the old style chairs?  Are the newer chairs any better?  Dan O.
650950,Joeytier,2011-12-25 19:38:00,3990,Mine is 2 years old now.  Definitely not so comfortable.  Not sure if they've since improved.
650951,Terry,2011-12-25 19:52:00,14456,and that is why I remove one of the chairs and use a folding lawn chair to sit in make more room for storage too
650968,CRAPPIE,2011-12-26 00:04:00,213,I have one for sell for 35 dollars. let me know if you are interest

651107,Oggie,2011-12-27 03:19:00,588,I'm going to use a folding chair as well Not sure what you're sell crappie?
651117,Moosebunk,2011-12-27 06:00:00,3970,They are NOT comfortable... at all.  Lawn chair is waaaaay better.
651135,oldphart,2011-12-27 13:24:00,665,"~~~~Yeah my back ache also, last year I was so stiff I tried to straighten my back, pushed back, and snapped the bolts holding the seat back. Was able to fix it no biggie, but I taking it out and getting a folding lawn chair, bou not the bucket style, they hurt my back also."
651159,GoneFishin,2011-12-27 16:18:00,349," I got the new clam folding chair with rod and tackle storage built in. When I sat in it I was thinking man this is uncomfortable, maybe I can bend it back a bit lol... It looks to be a back pack also but unless your built like a semi its not going to fit your shoulders.. No place to fit my tackle trays or round tip up. Looks to me like clam slapped their name on a cheap product they found. I will be looking a lot closer at clam produds before phurchasing again.."
651276,BillM,2011-12-28 00:54:00,17367,"The seats in my Nanook, for a lack of a better word, suck!  Replacing them for this season."
651361,rhare,2011-12-28 13:59:00,387,Seats have gotten much worse over time. I have a couple of huts from 10 years ago and they are a bit better but I wouldn't discribe them as comfortable. Clam huts have went waaaaay down hill in the quality department. The new ones are pretty much junk.
651424,Oggie,2011-12-28 18:47:00,588,Thanks guys for the input.  After the Clam chair did a number on my back it's been sore for years and now all kinds of situations irritate it.  Can you put a folding camp chair partially into the sled. I'm wondering if the two back legs will punch through the bottom of the sled?  Dan O.
651428,Terry,2011-12-28 19:17:00,14456,I used a folding camp chair for 5 years now without a problem with it hurting my hut
