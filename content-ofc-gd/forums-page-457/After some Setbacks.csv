Admitted Tues at midnight after being there all day. Got up for work again Wednesday at 4.30 am to go to work got home Wed night to go to Hospital to get home 9.pm to pass out on the bed. Finally released again Thursday at 4.30pm and now I have her back home again on meds. At least we have here home now and the doctor wants to see her again in 2 weeks. Hopefully she will not need to call him again till then.  Just an update for all"

This Christmas is even better yet with her healthy and moving well on arm crutches. I'm sure next Christmas will be extra special for you and Diane, as you look back on all this and reflect.  Wayne"
