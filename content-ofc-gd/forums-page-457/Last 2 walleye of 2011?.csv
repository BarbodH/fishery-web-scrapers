Have been looking forward to this all week, even bought a new rod and reel with some 'Nanofil' which my boy helped me spool up.  Fishing was sloooooooooooooooooow....but the snowmachine ride was awesome...perfect 6"" of  flat snow on the lakes!  Got one nice 22"" and a 15"".  Drilled lots of holes, both fish from one hole in 47' FOW.   (nanofil was ok....it was mild out and not many bites so  a full field review still pending)   HAPPY XMAS TO YOU ALL!   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mkTuqjbqhaA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
