This has put a huge damper on the Christmas spirit as everyone copes in whatever way they can.  I just wanted to tell my fellow OFC'ers about how my Christmas was saved by my children, specifically my 2.5 year old son.  Having no spirit of my own left I slowly began to feed off his energy.  By late Christmas Eve, after watching him give and receive presents with the family, I got my spirit back.  Probably stronger than it's been in years.  Children are the greatest gift a man could ever receive.  Merry Christmas everyone.  RIP Dave."

I fully understand the children part of your story though and I can take it one step further. My kids are 25 and 22. The Christmas spirit has not been much to write home about for a number of years now. HOWEVER my 3 1/2 year old grandson just gave grandpa and grandma a full helping of that again this year  :thumbsup_anim:   Little kids, and family at Christmas will pretty much cure anything."
