650600,captpierre,2011-12-23 21:05:00,2521,Dropped in at the cottage yesterday for a peek to make sure all was well.  Lake is frozen shore to shore in our area.  Thru a 2 lb rock up in the air from the dock.  The ice held and sounded fairly solid.  West of Hurricane Point the water was still soft.  Cold last night and today.  Won't be long
