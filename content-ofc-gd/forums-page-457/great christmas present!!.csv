650939,DundasSteelheader,2011-12-25 18:28:00,166,"Congrats nice reel man, got mine about a week ago, love it"
650957,Joeytier,2011-12-25 22:20:00,3990,The Steelheader's are nice reels.  Look after it and you'll get a lifetime of use out of it.  I just couldn't get over how much heavier they are than what I currently use.  But if you line it up right you can get it nicely balanced making it not so noticeable.
650975,Ralph Field,2011-12-26 01:40:00,1018,Congratulations on receiving your new reel. Islanders are true work horses and hold their value better than many of the other brands.
650991,ChrisK,2011-12-26 02:52:00,2772,Nice reel Devon. Now we just got to match that up with a new pole.
651113,newb09,2011-12-27 04:00:00,49, Sweet reel!!Congrats. Enjoy it
651139,davey buoy,2011-12-27 13:59:00,5505, What type of rod would you suggest for that reel Chris? Maybe looking for a reel like that myself soon:thumbsup_anim:
651147,Spiel,2011-12-27 15:00:00,9065,"Congratulations Devon, you're gonna like using that baby!"
651166,GBW,2011-12-27 16:53:00,8460,"I can't wait to see some of your reports as you get older.  you are a great angler as it is right now but mastering new toys, tricks and tools as you get older is going to be cool to watch (your reports).  I'm sure Spiel can match that reel up to the right rod, lol."
