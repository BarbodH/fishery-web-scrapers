Thanks Pam for using your creative Genious to work my photos into this...    and another view    lastly my christmas tree    Thanks again, Pam.  I look forward to receiving the print for my office."

13573,pameladallaire,2006-12-18 13:37:00,470,"That is a big wall.  It could have accomodated bigger.  I'm just glad you are happy with it.  I loved painting it!  Big, bold strokes.  A lot different than the smaller pieces I work on.  That is the way I'm heading, bigger is better in my book.  Merry Xmas pigeonfisher and family.    Pam"
13576,pigeonfisher,2006-12-18 13:44:00,696,"thanks, Pam.  We couldn't be happier.  Everyone who sees it is truly astonished by the beauty.  What I like is everytime you look at it you can find something else that makes it unique.  The use of bright colours in the rock and ""dirt"" is just WILD!!!!  Happy Holidays to you to Pam!!!   I will let my wife know that you liked the decorating job on the tree!  What do you think of the painting?"

13724,pigeonfisher,2006-12-18 19:53:00,696,I couldn't be more impressed with her work...hopefully another piece to add to the wall next year.
