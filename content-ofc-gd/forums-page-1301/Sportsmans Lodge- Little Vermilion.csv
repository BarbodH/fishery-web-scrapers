13072,John Glynn,2006-12-17 02:31:00,25,Just wondering if any of you guys ever fished at Sportsman lodge. Is the pike fishing good there. I am looking to do some trophy pike fishing in NW  Ontario next spring. Thanks in Advance  John
13077,MuskyBill,2006-12-17 02:46:00,311,"The Pike fishing is AWESOME, but no, I've never been.  Mepps will be on this thread before long, & he's caught some behemouths from there...."
13083,TennesseeGuy,2006-12-17 03:18:00,957,It's a good one.  C & R only for trophy pike.
13115,bpsbassman,2006-12-17 04:29:00,941,"Hey Tennessee Guy, Good to hear from you.  You really need to post a few of your beauty beasts!!"
13168,TennesseeGuy,2006-12-17 13:13:00,957,"Bpsbassman, my photos had their turn on the board.  PM went to Glynn offering pics and now giving him time to write back.  Going in May 12, 2007 if ice is gone and out June 2, 2007.  2007 is a catch up year for me."
13175,bpsbassman,2006-12-17 13:46:00,941,"Understood TG. However, every time I think about doing a trip up there I still have mental images of you holding those monsters. Good luck next season and I hope you make up for lost time!"
13190,Whopper,2006-12-17 14:36:00,2174," Roger, TG convinced me, Come on May  Whopper"
13250,mepps,2006-12-17 17:19:00,1301,"I have had the pleasure if fishing at Sportamans, and the honor of fishing with TennesseeGuy.  Both were rewarding and unforgettable events.  I missed out last year, but would like to be there this spring for sure.  And what LV thread would be complete without a couple photos of big pike... Here are a couple from May 2005              "
13275,Moosebunk,2006-12-17 18:23:00,3970,Those pike have more girth than Mepps.  Looks like a half decent vacation spot.
13277,mepps,2006-12-17 18:26:00,1301,"That last one probably had a girth that was close ot my waiste size for sure!  Its a great place, wonderful hosts as well!"
13326,John Glynn,2006-12-17 21:46:00,25,Guys Thanks for all the responses. Cant wait to get there. Great looking fish. I love the one with the suick hanging out of her mouth.
13344,setomonkey,2006-12-17 22:36:00,872,"THere have been some amazing piking reports from that part of Ontario, hopefully someday I'll make it up myself.  Mike"
13384,John Glynn,2006-12-18 00:08:00,25,Mepps  Did you guys get one off the dock?
13388,mepps,2006-12-18 00:36:00,1301,"Lots off the dock! Pike and walleye too.  When the wind is blowing into camp, it can be one of the best spots on the lake!"
13398,TennesseeGuy,2006-12-18 00:54:00,957,"Many a time I've arrived in camp late Friday and picked up supper off the dock.  Stay there an hour or so and a trophy pike will chase your lure.  JP made a living catching pike while constructing a dock in early May 2005.  Hammer a handful of nails, make a couple of casts, bring in a nice pike, hammer a handfull of nails, make a couple of casts..........................................................Pose for picture...............  They spawn in the back of the bay and go past the dock on the way out past the point into deeper water, which becomes their recovery area."
13584,arthur,2006-12-18 13:58:00,11,"Great thread. Mepps, those are awesome shots!  I saw another pic on your website, also with that Black/Chart spinner. Was that a favorrite lure for you up there? (Looks like you had no leader?!?)  What are your go to baits there?  Hope to see ya'll in the spring!!!"
13784,mepps,2006-12-18 22:57:00,1301,"Spinner baits are my favorite lure on any lake really.  They produced most of the big fish at LV too.  I have made my own spinners (#8 blade) for the next trip.     I have some secret colour combos I will be testing this year!  To tell you the truth, we didnt use leaders much that trip, didnt have any break offs luckily.  But some of those fish were caught while going after walleye.  I have started using leaders regularly since then, but at that time I rarely used them for pike, braided line has always held up."
13898,arthur,2006-12-19 03:03:00,11,"Thanks for those shots. Real nice inlines you've made there. Looks like a weedless hook on that first one, yeah?  Have you tried Hildebrandt blades? I love those for safety pinâ€“style spinnerbait replacement blades...."
13907,mepps,2006-12-19 03:11:00,1301,"Havent tried them, but I just looked them up, they look great!  I may have to test them out sometime."
13926,trapshooter,2006-12-19 03:33:00,1234,awesome looking in-lines man.
