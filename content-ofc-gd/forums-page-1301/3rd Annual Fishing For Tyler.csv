11644,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-13 13:13:00,0,"Maureen, Corey (mistyjr) and I intend on being there."
11664,JFR,2006-12-13 14:27:00,498," Moe, I'll work on that, and I might need a letter.  I'll also have the three portable BBQs and a coleman stove available for Cliff and Loonietoon John"
11674,TJQ,2006-12-13 14:47:00,7806,"here is the video for the news clip of Tylers G2G last year...  Tylers 2005 G2G  Is a bit too far away for me to commit, but ill try to be there....  maybe wife and kiddies too!!"
11677,Headhunter,2006-12-13 14:51:00,5703,"I'll be there and depending on the weather, if it's not too cold, I'll bring my 4 year old son as well! Either way, I'm glueing myself to Terry, as it's obvious, he knows where the Lakers are hiding! HH"
11686,Terry,2006-12-13 15:12:00,14456,Headhunter.....lol  maybe you should read how I caught it before you waste you time following me..it was pure  luck  .Terrys 2006  Bull luck  lake trout catch
11687,Headhunter,2006-12-13 15:15:00,5703,"I have a few ""lucky"" jigs at home, I'll be sure to bring along! HH"
11705,Terry,2006-12-13 16:01:00,14456,well I meant that it was Bull that I was even trying to catch a fish at that point  the meegs jigs have worked well for me
11711,misfish,2006-12-13 16:08:00,29133,"Yes you are a lucky fishermen. LOL   On numerous occasions last year, we all did well with the Meegs."
11720,dwc67,2006-12-13 16:46:00,140,i will be there and i will try to get tonyb to come he does a good job landing my fish
11746,Joey,2006-12-13 18:16:00,9122,We should be there for sure.  I have to beat my tie for second place this time  Joey
11759,tonyb,2006-12-13 19:14:00,1637,"I'll be there for sure, but it's your turn dwc67 to land my fish!  It will be a good outdoor test for my new Humminbird to see if it plays well with the Marcum flasher.  Also see how the screen holds up if it is cold out.  Maureen - I may have a handle on some Chicken for the food end of things.  Boneless skinless breasts that are 'par-cooked - 85% cooked' so they only need to be cooked on the bbq for a short period of time (Yay no raw chicken!).  I'll check with the supplier and get back to you before the event.  I might even be able to get some flats of desert bars like I brought last year, I think people liked the double-fudge brownies!  Looking forward to the event, hopefully I can also get some things for the prize table and I'll try to drag some buddies out as well.  Great cause, good for you for organizing it!  Cheers, Tony"

12030,motv8tr,2006-12-14 12:44:00,2587,"  TJ, it would be great if you and Monique and the kids were able to make...none of this would be happening if it weren't for you guys...here's hoping  As for the food, well I'll let you guys deal with Cliff on that one, he has generously offered to handle that end of things for me.  Please get in touch with him re: donations and such.  John, I will send a letter for you to use, and if anyone else needs a copy of the ""request for prizes"" letter I have been using please let me know and I will get it out to you.  Maureen"
12042,DT10Sam,2006-12-14 13:31:00,480,"Hi Everyone,  Well I will probably be there to act as body guards for Big Cliff and Loonietunes so that they do not get rushed at the BBQ's and the desert tables.  If I remember correctly we did have to check the deserts so that they were edible for everyone  Moe I will again come up with some prizes for your event.  Best regards, Sam"
12049,motv8tr,2006-12-14 13:38:00,2587,"Great news Sam, I'm looking forward to seeing you again, I hope this year you can bring Laurie and the kids with you.  Maureen"

I meant to do that last year, but got wrapped up in work, and, sadly, forgot to do so. Maureen, I will need your mailing address again. It's........""somewhere"".......on my pc, lol."
11450,motv8tr,2006-12-12 23:13:00,2587,"Hey Joe, I know Art won't come but if Glen is able to make the trip maybe you could join him?  And Tom, I was hoping you'd make the trip and deliver them yourself  Maureen"

Ok, now while TJSA and Aplumma are visualizing me without a shirt and with hard nipples... put me down for a $50 gift certificate from CT.  Hopefully my personal crap storm will have died down by then and I'll be able to attend, but it's comin' down by the bucketfulls right now.  Yer a good egg Mo, and if there's anythin' else I can do let me know.  Glen"

11493,Carp,2006-12-13 01:20:00,1488,"It's at Lake Simcoe nautifish. Last year, we were at the park at the end of Innisfil Beach Rd., south of Barrie. West side of the lake, just minutes to hwy. #400.  We had over 80 derby participants last year and hundreds of onlookers and people buying food and drinks back on shore, waiting for the might anglers to bring in their catches for measure.  Even made the local newspapers and a mention on the 'A' channel. (local T.V. station). Nice little clip of our very own Terry and his winning fish if someone can post it. I'm not that savvy yet with the puter.  I'll see if I can get something to add to the prize list Mo. This time I can give the potential donor(s) a bit more notice.  Oh well. I was beaten again. Too slow to post the location.  Hope to see ya there nautifish.  It's only 1hr from Timmins Dan.......by commercial plane. Seriously, it would be great if you did make the trip."
11500,irishfield,2006-12-13 01:26:00,26272,"4 hours from Temagami, Dan, in good weather....."

11543,DanTheMan,2006-12-13 02:31:00,257," Hmmm, Sounds like a good plan.Maybe  I can work something out with him"
11577,Ron,2006-12-13 04:07:00,1683,"I'll be bringing the same gear as last year Moe. If anyone else has an extra table or 2, Moe sure could use them.   This time, I'll make sure the coffee maker is plugged in too."
