13630,bpsbassman,2006-12-18 15:02:00,941,Two questions. Will anybody be down in Florida in January that might be interested in going bass fishing? Does anybody have a highly recommended guide for the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes?
13682,1leggedangler,2006-12-18 17:14:00,364,"Been out with Gator Rod Charters a couple of times. He guides out of Lake Toho in Kississmee. Offers full and half days. Never been disappointed, looking at a 9lbs largemouth mount on my wall from a day with him. PM if you would like details.  Cheers, 1leg"
13693,BabyHerc,2006-12-18 17:35:00,285,"Roger, not sure if they are part of the Kissimmee Chain, but Farm 13 and Stick whats his name are reportedly the best lakes in Florida for numbers of double digit bass.  Might be hard to find a guide, though."
13711,setomonkey,2006-12-18 19:13:00,872,"Hi Roger,  No matter what you do I think you will have a good time. Being able to go bassin' in the middle of the winter is a treat. I'll be in Florida in Feb with my wife, around the Orlando area.  I won't be hiring a guide but I've done so twice before, both times on inshore saltwater trips. Happy both times, I found the guides through this site. There are a few listed that guide Kissimmee or nearby.  Cyberangler Guides  I'm sure Jamie (crazyhook) will jump in too, he's fished Florida a lot.  Mike"
13714,bpsbassman,2006-12-18 19:18:00,941,"Thanks guys.  I remember somebody on this board mentioning an OFC type equivalent in Florida where I might also be able to hook up with someone.  Does anyone recall that. I've been tempted to do it every year, but most of them use minnows and balloons that time of year (not my style).  I would rather go out with someone and throw traditional rubber and lures. 1leg, how did you catch your lunker??"
13755,1leggedangler,2006-12-18 21:43:00,364,"Roger the biggin was caught with shiners, can get a little expensive as those buggers aren't cheap down there. Sounds like you don't want to fish with live bait but with the amount of pressure some of those inland lakes take it might be something to think about. Hope your have a great time!  Cheers, 1leg"
13758,Whopper,2006-12-18 21:58:00,2174,"Roger here is a link to the website that CH gave me before I went last spring, I was more interested in saltwater fishing at the time, It's a pretty big site that breaks down to regions.  http://www.floridasportsman.com/regions/  Kind of funny I registered a got a lot of good feed back and a couple of invites, but the guy that was supposed to meet up with me never made it past the hotel bar  Good Luck in your search!    Whopper"
13763,irishfield,2006-12-18 22:04:00,26272, Just like goin to Lakair.....
13767,Whopper,2006-12-18 22:08:00,2174," LOL Wayne  Wayne the guy emailed my after I got back, said he showed up every night while I was there looking for ""Whopper"""
