12728,Greencoachdog,2006-12-15 23:10:00,8163,"I voted console!  I'm sure a tiller has some advantages... but I can't think of any. I prefer a console for the simple fact you can always see where you're going, using a tiller and taking off from a standstill.... give 'er gas and look straight forward, what do you see?... the front floor of the boat, the same with stopping... but that's just me!   Art, that is called stick steering... you're playing with your boat's stick, pushing it back and forth, back and forth..."
12747,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 23:36:00,3421,"Here is something I found on the net.If only a Manufacturer could build a boat that you could drive with a wheel switch to the stern in comfortable position to troll. now that would be the ideal boat maybe even a retractable winshield.      This is from the net  I've been looking the Lowe Angler series of aluminum boats for fishing lakes >and light duty saltwater.  For each length model the choice is either >console or tiller steering.  What are benefits and advantages does one have >over the other?  This is going to be my first boat purchase and your >insights would be greatly appreciated.  >TIA...bg    Biggest difference will be in comfort/convenience vs. fishing room.  A console steered boat has some shelter from the wind and water, which are valuable if you fish in rough condiitions.  The only thing more uncomfortable than sitting and fishing on a very cold day is driving across the lake at 35 mph on a very cold day.   With a console, you also get a convenient arrangement of controls where everything is within half an arm's length.  You also get better weight distribution with more weight toward the front of the boat; the overall performance of the boat may be be a bit better, although the weight of the console eats some of that up.   A tiller steered boat offers maximum useful space.  There's nothing in the middle of the boat (like a console) to snag your line on.  You can have more people fishing from the boat without feeling as crowded.  It's a simpler boat to maintain, with no steering or trim systems, and all other wiring systems   (Tillers Now have power trim) simplified since everything is right there in the back of the boat.   Here's the bad news:  Whichever you get, you will probably be sorely reminded of the advantages of the other style when you are needing those features.   Here's the good news:  You'll probably own both types in your boating lifetime.   Here's more bad news:  When you have moved from one to the other, you'll miss the old one, too.   No boat is perfect.  Analyze it, pick one, go fishing.   -- Rich Stern"
12913,OhioFisherman,2006-12-16 14:17:00,6623,"Don`t old guy`s use tillers? I mean really, younger guys like myself and Lew have adjusted quite well to steering wheels, granted it takes some doing, but I am sure that given enough time even some of you geezers can do it! LOL just kidding, it`s a matter of personal preference, if you troll a lot on smaller waters a tiller makes sense.  How many don`t get the car thing?"
13032,IanD,2006-12-17 00:27:00,16,"All I have ever run in 30 years is a tiller. New rig follows the same style. I like the extra floor space and the extra degree of control offered. Now if I was making a 30 mile run, I'd let the son-in-law drive. "
13035,danc,2006-12-17 00:41:00,4677,"Sight fishing, and seeing whats up front of me is my game, so a console is my choice. And, although I rarely do, I have the option of battening down the hatches and putting the top up in inclement weather. From what I understand, the precision that back trolling for Walleye requires is best done with a tiller. But that's not my game. I'll stick with my console with all of my gauges right in front of me."
13041,Clampet,2006-12-17 00:58:00,1947,"Console, for shelter from elements."
13052,Bob Devine,2006-12-17 01:33:00,251,"I prefer a console but with a smaller boat 14-16 a console would be best. I had the chance to guide a guy last yr on the Detroit River with a 20 Ranger with a 150 tiller/power steering of course and thought it was cool. Only problem was blast off, it was a 4 stroke and you had to keep an eye when as it took a bit to get on plane. Lots of room for fishing on that boat. I have a 21' - 225 Merc with the console and for the big water around here, LSC, Erie and other bodies that I fish I would have nothing else."
13182,Fish Farmer,2006-12-17 14:14:00,2234,"TILLER all the way I have both, Stand up top in all. But doing some real fishing, give me my TILLER."
13229,glen,2006-12-17 16:41:00,2641,my boat and motor can be tiller or console.  I have never used it as a tiller.  I had a tiller before and the console is better.  I can talk to the person beside me when running at speed.  Try that in a tiller with a guy in the bow.
13461,PERCHER,2006-12-18 02:52:00,787,Also a Tiller fan.More floor space.I need all the floor space I can get for all those monster fish we catch
13530,Carp,2006-12-18 05:58:00,1488," Ditto !!!  Have both, but I prefer the side console."
12400,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 04:12:00,3421,Ok Guys and Girls what do you prefer Tiller or Steering Wheel?Need your fair opinions!We already know what the Bass Boats prefer.I see some boats with a console and a steering wheel trolling with a tiller kicker.  Disreguard my first 2 attempts at this poll which ended up in the Help section.LOL I am just getting used to this board.I am stuck in between tiller and wheel.I like fishing for walleye in the warm summer  with a tiller but come November I would prefer to have a full wrap windshield with the steering wheel and a roof.  Mike    
12402,kemper,2006-12-15 04:16:00,2232,"large can of worms you just opened...  but for the record, console!"
12407,TJQ,2006-12-15 04:21:00,7806,Yeee Haa!!!   I wait for this thread EVERY YEAR... its like a xmas present!!!
12411,kemper,2006-12-15 04:25:00,2232, It really is!  CONSOLE!!!!!
12413,irishfield,2006-12-15 04:27:00,26272,The true answer in a perfect world...TILLER  The only solution for ours...full windshield and top !
12430,Blake,2006-12-15 05:04:00,418,I prefer a side console with wheel and shield.  I have this on my Lund and its great and the perfect compromise.  I have tons of fishable area and its easy to walk around all over the boat.
12433,Bernie,2006-12-15 05:09:00,3190,Two times its happened on opening day on Nipissing in the last few years-SNOW...Give me a top and a wheel.
12448,mrpike,2006-12-15 09:25:00,151,THIS is what I think . If it is just for fishing then tiller is the only way togo. IT is better for fishing because you can control the boat better tighter turns and everything is at your arms reach . I had a tiller and I miss it.  I have a 17 ft LUND now with console  and wish I got it with a tiller .MY next one will be tiller thats for sure.  ITS  hard to operate steering wheel and a down rigger at the same time for one person. YOU REALLY need to try them both out so you can make up your own MIND. IT really is personal THING.  Just my too cents.  IT really comes down to what suites you best . Try them both out before you buy and you CAN'T GO WRONG.
12459,Whopper,2006-12-15 12:18:00,2174,"IMHO to me it boils down to two things size of the boat and what kinda of fishing your doing. Smaller boats tillers a great, larger boats I don't think you can beat the comfort of a console.  Whopper"
12461,aplumma,2006-12-15 12:25:00,6896,"Dang I never do any good at this question because I dont know what my boat is. You sit in the middle of the boat up high so you can see were you are going and the throttle is on the right and the steering rod is on the left. I dont have a console and I aint giving my motor a ""reach back"" soooooo......?  Art"
12462,Whopper,2006-12-15 12:28:00,2174, Art your special
12466,DanTheMan,2006-12-15 12:36:00,257,"Voted,  Tiller all the way!!!!"
12467,Motorhead,2006-12-15 12:40:00,163,I own a 12 tinny with a 7.5 merc. If I ever save enough to buy something bigger it will be a console  Doug
12470,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-15 12:55:00,4399,"I own a console full windshield rig now and i love it,its nice on those long runs on cold mornings. My previous rig was a tiller and it was great for fishing lots of control but those long runs on a cold morning were no fun."

12480,John,2006-12-15 13:14:00,2956,"In a perfect world, both.  Can't beat a tiller when fishing alone, BUT, like Wayne, I am a windshield and top man all the way for various reasons."
12486,Terry,2006-12-15 13:26:00,14456,full windshield and top for cold wet days tiller for small lakes
12488,Spiel,2006-12-15 13:34:00,9065,....Tiller....    Since I can only afford one boat it'll have to do. I understand you can get tops with full enclosures for tillers. I may look into though I'm quite fond of frostbit cheeks.
12508,b2kptbo,2006-12-15 14:05:00,1505,"Have both, still get wet when it rains and lose my hat in the wind... "
