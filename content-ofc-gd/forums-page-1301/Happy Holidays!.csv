13623,b2kptbo,2006-12-18 14:52:00,1505,Good job with the lights. And a happy safe Xmas...
13672,Whopper,2006-12-18 16:50:00,2174,"Thanks everyone for the kind words.  Believe or not I have actually downsized the last couple of years, for a few years it was out of control.   Besides the installation (about six full days) the maintence was taking way to much time and by the time it was all up and running right it was time to take em down (another three days). But I do enjoy doing it.  One year I was late getting them up and I had people stopping at the house to see if everything was ok and if I needed any help  Peter the trailer had bee sitting at the lot at my office and when I took the locks off so they wouldn't bigger up the trailer it must have made them mad so they shot the window out of my office, that didn't go over to good with the landlord.  Lew it's always a big joke after I get the lights done because my wife will say ""Clark your lights aren't twinkling""  Happy Holidays All!  Whopper"
