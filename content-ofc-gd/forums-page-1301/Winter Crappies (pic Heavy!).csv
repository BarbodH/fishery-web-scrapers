12955,Rich,2006-12-16 19:32:00,3927,"Maybe that title should say SPRING crappies! The weather sure felt like spring out there and the fish were biting like it was early March. Tons of crappies caught today in the bass hound on a local pond. Sleded scored with the ""trophy"" of the day, a 13 incher. Lots of nice surprises thrown in the mix as well. Gotta love being in the boat in mid-December!  All fish were caught on 1 inch chartreuse grubs.                "
