14122,Smokey,2006-12-19 18:08:00,1278,I had the 4.7 in my 2001 Dakota. Was a strong engine with lots of power but heavy on fuel. I had no problems what so ever with the motor though for the time I owned it.  Mike
14156,carll2,2006-12-19 19:05:00,443,4.7 v8 is a good engine..stay away from the 4.0 v8 in the grand cherokee its just as hard on gas as the 4.7s
14168,Smokey,2006-12-19 19:45:00,1278,I agree with Carl. I had the 4.0 also and it was heavier on fuel then the 4.7.
14170,Raf,2006-12-19 19:48:00,3495,"Propably due to the extra size and weight of the GC.  Motor has to work harder.  I have the 4.0 I6 in my regular Cherokee and while it's no econobox, the mileage is OK."
