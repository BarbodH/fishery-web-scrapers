13449,GbayGiant,2006-12-18 02:33:00,1780,"My boat is getting old and the paint job (original 1980) is getting worn out, I like boats that have no paint job just left chrome/silver.  What would be the best way to remove all the paint and just leave it chrome ? or would it be easier to give it another paint job ?  As much as I love sanding"
13455,irishfield,2006-12-18 02:39:00,26272,"Drop by a jobber shop that sells paint supplies. Ask for the Mar Hid stripper..but you want the Alum compatible stuff not the regular (and they'll probably have to order it in)...has a Jet on the can last time I saw it. About $50 a gallon.  Has to be done inside or you're wasting your time. 65 to 75*F shop...no breeze...otherwise the stuff can't ""wax"" over and let the stripper do it's job.  Other option is someone that is GOOD at soda blasting.  As much as it's tempting...a wire wheel in a drill isn't the smartest thing to do on aluminum...not that I know anything about alum!  If you do ""sand"". Be sure to use either 3M Scotchbrite pads or alum oxide sandpaper only."
13511,GbayGiant,2006-12-18 04:44:00,1780,"Thanks for all the tips Irish, I guess you know a little about aluminum"
13534,Carp,2006-12-18 06:54:00,1488,He be the OFC aluminum guru that Irish dude.
13537,Greencoachdog,2006-12-18 09:43:00,8163,"Citrus Strip sold at Wal-Mart is the easiest thing I've found, it also needs a temp of about 65*F but has no noxious fumes, isn't flammable and washes off with soap and water... it's REAL GOOD stuff!"
13681,irishfield,2006-12-18 17:11:00,26272,Haven't seen that stuff Glen. Next time I'm in Walmart I'll grab some and give it a go on an old Cessna tail fin I have in the hangar and see what it does for 40 year old paint and zinc chromate primer.
13701,Greencoachdog,2006-12-18 18:28:00,8163,"Try it Wayne, you'll like it. It's in the ""Paint"" section of Wal-Mart, it's what I used to remove the carpet adhesive from the inside of my boat... and the spots that had adhesive over paint, it removed the paint too."
