13447,Blake,2006-12-18 02:31:00,418,Just found out a new Sponsor to the Board Fishing World in Hamilton is having an after hours sale this Tuesday Dec 19. Couldn't find out everything on sale but was told there would be some great stuff available for Xmas gifts or gear that you just want to buy.  I did ask TJ if it was okay to post and I thought since they are new sponsors to the board it would be a great opportunity to show Fishing World some support.

14066,tonyb,2006-12-19 16:00:00,1637,"Sounds like a sale to off load all the crap they couldn't sell all year.  None of that stuff piques my interest, unfortunately.  Tony"
