12842,snag,2006-12-16 04:02:00,1932,"Hey Glen,  Glad all went well.  My Dad went through the same thing and is still around to see his 7 month old grand child.  He still needs you."
12852,verno,2006-12-16 04:47:00,178,Glad to hear it all worked out well.  Hope he keeps recovering quickly.
12858,Nanook,2006-12-16 05:03:00,565,"Good to hear 'bout your Dad Glen, ya cant keep those fiesty old Guy's down for long. Once he's healed up,he'll be in better shape than you"
12859,GbayGiant,2006-12-16 05:10:00,1780,"Glad to hear he's doing good, my old man only (57) just had a quituple bypass, the works, it's been 5 months and he's feeling better than ever."
12862,Dondorfish,2006-12-16 05:21:00,1000,Welcome back - and glad to hear your dad is on the mend. Hope you get some time at Christmas to go back and spend some time with him.    Don
12870,irishfield,2006-12-16 06:27:00,26272,Sounds like things went well Glen. I'm sure he's a tough stubborn bugger like you..so I can't drill it home to you enough to be sure he isn't in a situation of needing to lift anything PERIOD for months!  My mother had her quad at 65 and is now into her 81st year as of May. My sister had a quad at 50..3 years ago now and even though she says she didn't...I know she was carrying around her new Granddaughter before she should have been. Now she has a sternum that is a jelly mass instead of bone structure/muscle and is permanently disabled and had to resign as head floor nurse.  I repeat...make sure he's in a position where he doesn't have to lift anything and he'll have many wonderful years ahead of him.  Wayne

12894,b2kptbo,2006-12-16 12:29:00,1505,"Glad to hear thing went well for your Dad, hope he has a speedy recovery..."
13013,tjsa,2006-12-16 23:13:00,1578,"Hi Glen, sorry to hear about your dad, and your pup. I have been out of sorts for over a week myslelf(chest cold, and probably a touch of the flu). Don't remember much since last saturday. Probably was in chat, but don't remember. Glad your dad is doing ok. My dad had quad bypass also way back in 1995, and he got through it fine. Recovered well within a year, and was back out walking a few kilometers within 2 yrs. Hope your dad does also, and hope the pup recovers as well."
13148,OhioFisherman,2006-12-17 11:08:00,6623,"Glen glad to hear your dad is doing good, I know I am slow ."
13154,kennyman,2006-12-17 12:35:00,737,"Glad to hear everything is looking up. My mom had her first heart attack last Christmas. Thankfully,she only needed a stint and is doing fine now (it was still really scarey). It was a real eye opener and it changed the way I live my life. I quit smoking and even though I'm eating better I've put on a few pounds (part and parcel. I think).  I started doing the outdoors thing,camping and fishing etc. It made me put things in perspective and see what really is important. Kind of sucks at Christmas,but just think, you've already got the best present you can get. Hope the next couple weeks is a little calmer for you. Sounds like a good reason to take it easy and go fishing.  . Take care."
13158,Rich Clemens,2006-12-17 12:45:00,3131,"Seems like open heart surgery is relatively routine any more with a very high sucess rate.  I know of many people in the age range that had multiple bypasses, valve replacements, and all were succussful.  My grandmother was in her mid 80's when she had it done and recovered wonderfully.   Great news to hear your father came through this and improving each day.  Just make sure he follows the Dr. instructions and don't rush the recovery process ... it will come"

I've known a few folks who've had the same operation and every single one was 100 % better after they got back on their feet again.

12817,pigeonfisher,2006-12-16 02:46:00,696,"Wow...pretty tough eh Glen?  Glad Dad is pulling through.  buddy at work had a former co-worker go down on the job two days ago with a major coronary.  guy had about 14 hours of surgery in the last 36 hours but is now apparently speaking again and they think he may recover.  Gotta love medicine, and those wonderful, patient doctors and nurses!"
