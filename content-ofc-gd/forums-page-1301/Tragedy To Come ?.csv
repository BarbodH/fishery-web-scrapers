12585,Entropy,2006-12-15 18:18:00,747,"After reading,  http://www.nugget.ca/webapp/sitepages/cont...name=Local+News  I’m worried that this year might be full of ice related accidents and tragedies.  Can you recall some ‘notable’ problems with ice in the last 5 years.....?  Was it two years ago when all the cars and trucks went through the ice on Simcoe, right near shore?  Entropy"
12586,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-15 18:22:00,0,"Right at Gilford, first week of January....  "
12591,Entropy,2006-12-15 18:40:00,747,"mistyriver1,  was that last year?  why did that happen.... simply too thing of ice for the weight, or did the water level drop and .....  Entropy"
12593,misfish,2006-12-15 18:46:00,29133,I think that happen due to 10% thin ice-90% stupidity.  Was to earlly to be parking out there then.
12594,cplummer,2006-12-15 18:47:00,165,I was told it was from some guy that bought a new power auger and decided to try it out  within 5 feet of his vehice  and combined with all the weight the water came up through the hole and the rest is history.. cliff....
12598,misfish,2006-12-15 18:51:00,29133,"Hey Cliff,I did say 90% ."
12599,Entropy,2006-12-15 18:54:00,747,The guy with the neon got lucky.
12601,MuskyBill,2006-12-15 19:02:00,311,"Yup, that was Gilford last year.    I heard the same story about the auger, but who really knows, maybe just an 'urban legend'."
12603,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-15 19:05:00,0," Yes, that was last year.  I didn't see it happen but took this picture as we came in from fishing.  I think MuskyBill has some more.  There were two many cars parked there for that time of year. Don't know about the auger story, like I said this was what we walked in and saw.   I knew you had some more pics Billy !!  Yours were obviously taken after mine."
12604,Pigeontroller,2006-12-15 19:10:00,2793,Anyone who drives onto the ice and parks like its a Walmart parking lot  is too dumb to live long...  Remember Natural Selection?
12606,dheitzner,2006-12-15 19:12:00,314,"the story about someone making a hole with an auger is true!  i don't know if it was new or if it was a power auger but there was indeed a 6 or 8"" hole amongst the parked cars on that day. i was walking into shore after fishing for the morning and noticed water on the ice near the cars.  closer inspection showed water flowing up through the fresh auger hole.   guess the weight of the cars coupled with all of the water on the ice was too much. i'd hate to be stuck with the tow bill for something like that."
12673,yzer93,2006-12-15 21:43:00,7,stupidity plays the major part i think....next time you won't
12682,Fisherman,2006-12-15 21:57:00,7201,"Pigeon troller has the right answer, to many nitwits practicing their parking like it's Walmart. The ice at a given thickness can only support X amount of weight spread over a limited area, beyond that, I don't care if there's holes or not, you will sink.  It's called Physics."
12699,Clampet,2006-12-15 22:24:00,1947,"I copied the following from:  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/safety/ice/index.html  Ice safety tips  Before venturing out on a frozen lake or pond keep in mind: There is no such thing as 100 percent safe ice!  Recommended minimum ice thickness  Recommended ice thickness for: people - 4 inches; snowmobiles - 5 inches; cars or small pickups - 8 to 12 inches; medium pickups - 12 to 15 inches. Ice 2 inches thick or less: stay off! 4"" of new clear ice is the minimum thickness for travel on foot 5"" is minimum for snowmobiles and ATVs 8""- 12"" for cars or small trucks  (Remember that these thicknesses are merely guidelines for new, clear, solid ice. Many factors other than thickness can cause ice to be unsafe.)  Check for known thin ice areas with a local resort or bait shop. Test the thickness yourself using an ice chisel, ice auger or even a cordless 1/4 inch drill with a long bit.  Refrain from driving on ice whenever possible. If you must drive a vehicle, be prepared to leave it in a hurry--keep windows down, unbuckle your seat belt and have a simple emergency plan of action you have discussed with your passengers.  Stay away from alcoholic beverages. Even ""just a couple of beers"" are enough to cause a careless error in judgment that could cost you your life. And contrary to common belief, alcohol actually makes you colder rather than warming you up.  Don't ""overdrive"" your snowmobile's headlight. At even 30 miles per hour, it can take a much longer distance to stop on ice than your headlight shines. Many fatal snowmobile through-the-ice accidents occur because the machine was travelling too fast for the operator to stop when the headlamp illuminated the hole in the ice.  Wear a life vest under your winter gear. Or wear one of the new flotation snowmobile suits. And it's a good idea to carry a pair of ice picks that may be home made or purchased from most well stocked sporting goods stores that cater to winter anglers. It's amazing how difficult it can be to pull yourself back onto the surface of unbroken but wet and slippery ice while wearing a snowmobile suit weighted down with 60 lbs of water. The ice picks really help pulling yourself back onto solid ice. CAUTION: Do NOT wear a flotation device when travelling across the ice in an enclosed vehicle! DNR News:  12/04/2006: Make a set of ice rescue claws Full story  More DNR News Releases What if a companion falls through thin ice?  * Keep calm and think out a solution. * Don't run up to the hole. You'll probably break through and then there will be two victims. * Use some item on shore to throw or extend to the victim to pull them out of the water such as jumper cables or skis, or push a boat ahead of you. * If you can't rescue the victim immediately, call 911. It's amazing how many people carry cellphones. * Get medical assistance for the victim. People who are subjected to cold water immersion but seem fine after being rescued can suffer a potentially fatal condition called ""after drop"" that may occur when cold blood that is pooled in the body's extremities starts to circulate again as the victim starts to re-warm.  What if YOU fall in?  Try not to panic. Instead, remain calm and turn toward the direction you came from. Place your hands and arms on the unbroken surface of the ice (here's where the ice picks come in handy.) Work forward on the ice by kicking your feet. If the ice breaks, maintain your position and slide forward again. Once you are lying on the ice, don't stand. Instead, roll away from the hole. That spreads out your weight until you are on solid ice. This sounds much easier than it really is to do.  The best advice is don't put yourself into needless danger by venturing out too soon or too late in the season. No angler, no matter how much of a fishing enthusiast, would want to die for a crappie.

12716,Greencoachdog,2006-12-15 22:48:00,8163,It was actually this year '06... but last season.
13738,Entropy,2006-12-18 20:31:00,747,"I guess I never really thought about that... don't drill holes too close to parked cars.  Awww, and I like fishing off of my tailgate. ....  Should I stop?"
