14136,Sandbag,2006-12-19 18:30:00,533,Just starting to get a little bit worried.  I have an annual ice fishing trip with the boys planned for January 11th-16th on Lake Nippising.  Things not looking too good right now for having ice.  Anybody else getting the jitters about a planned trip????
14138,Raf,2006-12-19 18:36:00,3495,We're booked for the 19th.  Fingers are crossed!!
14139,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 18:38:00,3382,14 day outlook for North Bay doesn't give much hope for ice making on the lake. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/1...84.htm?CAON0484
14140,Raf,2006-12-19 18:40:00,3495,"Remember Rick, those are daytime highs.  Lots more night-time this time of year.  I think Nip Ice will be ok mid-january."
14141,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 18:44:00,3382,I just saw the forecast for my area and will be in the teens again around New YEars...outdoor parties will be big
