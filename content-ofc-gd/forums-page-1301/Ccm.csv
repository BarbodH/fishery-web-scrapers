13605,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 14:32:00,7971,"  For those who missed it....here was my ""coming out"" so to speak....hehe.  Ok, my secret is out, I might as well confess........the real reason all our pictures are at night, the real reason we are never in the same photo, and the real reason we catch ""big"" fish........ Ccmt is a hobbit. His real name is Grigory Bolger and yes, we do live in the Shire.  Thank you Moosebunk for outing him, it is such a relief, now he can be himself. By the way, that 4 pounder was actually 4.25  That is a BIG difference for ""little people"".
