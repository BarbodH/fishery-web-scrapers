13667,BITEME,2006-12-18 16:16:00,1969,Hey Tonyb i like junk in the back Terry the box dosent look like much but if yo fold the seats down turns into a suit case Lew i tried to get the jumla stickers of the old lady but they were stuck like poop to a blanket...I hope there are still some floating around iI would be honoured to fly another one Joey I bet that cooler would fit in the back
13793,Mike the Pike,2006-12-18 23:42:00,3421,Pete nice rig but your good friend works at Ford??????????. Now that that you ditched the old lady who was only 2wd.I guess you will be trying the mistress on all fours.  
13796,Rizzo,2006-12-18 23:50:00,4754,"your mistress looks familiar, pretty sure I saw a few different people take 'er for a test ride while she was still on the market"
13806,Carp,2006-12-19 00:09:00,1488,"SWEET RIDE !!!  Yeah, I took little miss 4 Runner for ride. Had her on all fours most of the time.  She's a good woman, look after her and she'll give ya what you need."
