13545,Rich Clemens,2006-12-18 11:17:00,3131,"Multi-species.  I do most of my fishing north of the border.  July is bass season and we do fairly well.  Late September we target Muksie and Pike.  After a period of time wiht no activity, I guess you could say I'd be happy with anything that takes the line.  But - we're out there enjoying the out of doors regardless of the bite.  We typically keep a few basss for a fish fry and everything else is released for someone else or our next trip."
13561,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-18 13:05:00,0,"Great question Jamie.  I would say mulit-species for me, but the toothy guys are my fave"
13569,MJL,2006-12-18 13:31:00,2427,"Carp 1/3 of the year, steelhead/salmon/browns the other 2/3's.  I still do the odd trips in summer for bass and pike though."
13572,setomonkey,2006-12-18 13:37:00,872,"Multi-species, I fish whenever I can but will target certain species depending on season and the lake we're going to. Trout in the early spring (though not last year), panfish in April/May, then pike & walleye usually open, mostly bass in July & August, and then bass, pike, or muskie in the Fall.  Don't usually target 'eyes, except for a couple of hours around dusk at the cottage lake.  Have never targeted carp, catfish, etc.  Mike"

13590,tonyb,2006-12-18 14:11:00,1637,If it has fins it makes me grin Multi-species all the way.  I am currently getting pumped to catch some Ling in the great white north this winter. Tony
13614,fishnsled,2006-12-18 14:41:00,3520,Multispecies angler for sure.  In the fall mainly muskies with a trip or 2 to Quinte thrown into mix it up a bit.
13619,Basskicker,2006-12-18 14:47:00,421,"I love my bass fishing, but I'm definately a multi-species fisherman.  Pike, walleye, perch during the ice season, trout in the early spring.  Usuall spring trip to Kirkland lake for a week for some huge pike....then a bit of walleye before the bass season opens.  Then bass until September before the salmon hit and some more trouting until freeze up.  12 months a year....  Jason"
13628,brickNblock,2006-12-18 15:01:00,598,"Great thread and equally great responses from everyone. I grew up close to one particular trib so I'd half to say creek 'bows and it's still my Fav, but, This board has turned me into a muskymaniacman...fortuante enough not having to have paid my full dues with 10,000 casts...and I believe I have more musky equipment/lures then for all other species combined. I love the ice for perchin cuz its nice being able to feel a tug on the line in the cold winters when my creek has frozen up and its the time my whole family will get out and actually all enjoy. Reaaly enjoy my outings with fishdawg..so I have to add LakeO salmon/browns/lakers to the list. Multi-Species for sure."
13634,arthur,2006-12-18 15:09:00,11,"Bass and pike most of the time. Lakers, pickerel and browns are the by-catch....  A little bit of panfishing (YP, sunnies, and Crappie) when that action is hot.  Surfcasting for stripers....  Carp fishing with bait and soon on the fly...."
13640,Entropy,2006-12-18 15:20:00,747,"Anything that tugs my rod, I'll take."
13646,shawnf,2006-12-18 15:30:00,46,"Multi-Species.... but thats a reflection of my job. hahahha  I REALLY want to focus in on the bass, however not a lot of bass here in So Dak.  The rest of the family here are Walleye, and Pike.  Maybe if I look hard enough, I'll find the bass in this region."
13649,b2kptbo,2006-12-18 15:42:00,1505,"Multi-Species, have a least 4 rods rigged with different stuff so I'm ready to go..."
13708,charlesn,2006-12-18 19:01:00,551,"Bass.  From May to late June (Lake Erue).  My fishing season ends on Nov 30th most years.  Now that NY is open 365, I will be able to start bassin probably in late March/early April.  Have fished for steelhead and lakers in the Winter on the Niagara, fun but just too darn cold.  Perch in the early spring is fun - once or twice when the winds on the big lake force you inland.  But there is just something about bass that makes it occupy 99.999% of brain real estate.  The competitive aspect is probably what drives me to improve.  Charles"
13716,Rizzo,2006-12-18 19:19:00,4754,"I'm a simple guy: musky, pike, bass when in Canada.  Dolphin, kingfish, wahoo, barracuda when visiting mom in florida (oh ya, hard to beat the fight of those pesky bonita as well)"
13722,Headhunter,2006-12-18 19:31:00,5703,"Walleye guy here! If the body of water holds eye's, I'll fish for them first! HH"
13752,huntervasili,2006-12-18 21:08:00,1604,"I will try anything but Particularily Like fishing for browns and bows with the fly rod... no roaring engines or anyone to bug me.... just the sound of a river is what I wanna hear... I like fishing for Walleye, Bass, Pike too... Anything else is just a bonus..."
13774,BITEME,2006-12-18 22:20:00,1969,Anything and every thing dont usually target carp or suckers though Fresh or saltwater If its wet ill dip it
13778,danc,2006-12-18 22:34:00,4677,"I've always been a Trout guy. I used to live for Steelhead fishing, but eventually graduated to Brook Trout fishing. I'll target just about anything except Pike and course fish, if the time is right though. There's nothing like a good feed of Walleye."
13783,jeffw,2006-12-18 22:54:00,267,I live on sturgeon lake so every species in there especially muskie at the end of the season unfortunately. But I have too say my favourite passion is saltwater reef and flats fishing. Especially with a flyrod. Cheers Jeff
13812,Ben_Daniels,2006-12-19 00:23:00,435,Im at work right now and that sounds like heaven...
13823,fishindevil,2006-12-19 00:41:00,6254,"I love fishing period,its my love and passion i will fish for anything and every species i have equiptment for almost all the freshwater fish,anything goes from panfish to sturgeon   im not afraid to say it,i love to catch all kinds of fish,and will forever  but if i had to pick my favourite it would be      WALLEYE...MMMMM YUMMMMYYYYY"
13840,Pigeontroller,2006-12-19 01:12:00,2793,"My main species has changed over the years...And for a few it was more about being the fish than fishing...  As a teenager Bass and Steelhead were my main targets...  Now I'm mostly interested in Muskie from June till late fall! Last spring my interest in Salmon/Trout trolling on Lake O was sparked, hoping to do more of that next year.  Still willing to go after any finned adversary though!  "
13881,tjsa,2006-12-19 02:35:00,1578,"Primarily walleye for me, but during specific times of specific months, steel, brook trout, salmon(coho and chinook), lake trout also. Pike are an incidental catch when after waldo's, consider them trash fish really, annoying pests that steal my bait and break my lures off, lol."
13412,Crazyhook,2006-12-18 01:41:00,1154,"Do you have a true passion for bass, musky or walleye or do you enjoy any fish that pulls on your line?  I was a die hard musky angler ( still toss and turn and think about them all the time) but do really enjoy my annual bass / pike fishing tournament, fishing for sharks down south ( my current greatest love) , all saltwater fish, my new friend the carp, and will give fly fishing a good go next season  what makes you happy?"
13415,Gerritt,2006-12-18 01:45:00,6129,"Well I was a multi-Species angler... mainly Walleye and Perch...MMMMmmmmm... but I seriously think I am addicted to Rainbows... they are all I think about after spending a week fishing for em.. I mean 6lb-8lb test, 4lb leader and a fish that fights like heck whats not to love... seriously they are all I am thinking about!!!   Gerritt."
13418,FishFinder,2006-12-18 01:49:00,481,"Yeah, insert <Steelhead> for me too"
13424,Bernie,2006-12-18 01:58:00,3190,"I work on engines and noisey equipment, listen to the doggone phone ringing, and occasionally my wonderful wifes tongue lash. When I go fishing I dont want to troll and listen to another engine running.Park it on a reef and catch a bucket of walleye. Nothing finer."
13425,dheitzner,2006-12-18 01:59:00,314,bass is my first passion when it comes to fishing but i really love whatever's on the end of my line.
13427,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-18 02:01:00,0,There is a time and a place for EVERYTHING.  To much of a good thing is not a good thing. ...unless its fishing.. ...then it's never enough..!!   
13428,muskymatt,2006-12-18 02:02:00,2608,"Muskie , then lake trout, then walleye ,,,but I do have to say any pull is exciting to me.  Matt"
13433,medic,2006-12-18 02:13:00,16,"Love the eyes, but anything that pulls is a thrill !!"
13434,Raf,2006-12-18 02:14:00,3495,june to december it's pretty much just muskies but the other months are spent fishing for the other species.
13436,urbanangler1990,2006-12-18 02:14:00,933,"every season different species, ill go after 2 species per season, like for summer ill go for bass and carp... and so on..."
13465,Ben_Daniels,2006-12-18 03:01:00,435,"I am a multispecies angler, but started bass fishing young and whenever i go out to fish pike, walleye, crappie I always end up fishing for bass without even thinking about it..."
13473,ChrisK,2006-12-18 03:12:00,2772,Anything and everything !!! 
13483,Carp,2006-12-18 03:47:00,1488,"I'll fish for just about anything, but walleye and great lakes salmon and trout are probably my favourites. "
13485,fishdawg,2006-12-18 03:50:00,912,"definetly multi species  though I am really starting to enjoy open water trolling for salmon, trout & walleye, i still find time for all the others.  Its nearly impossible to be a year round angler with just one species in mind, though it does make things a little more pricey to outfit yerself to be able to do so  I also enjoy travelling around to new spots/places, so being a multi-species guy I am never disapointed with what species are available in a given spot."
13492,GbayGiant,2006-12-18 04:01:00,1780,"Love it all, but Muskie, Walleye, salmon/rainbow are my go to. I think it just has alot to do with where you live, grew up in Collingwood all salmon/trout action, moved up north now it's all Muskie Walleye action."
13494,gbalardo,2006-12-18 04:05:00,20,take it season by season....fish it all.
13495,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 04:05:00,7971,"This past year, it's been exclusively Walleye...but it's that by default.  I dont have a boat, and because of my day job and kids, I can only get out at night.  Catching trophy eyes is an awesome feeling, but next year I'd like to get out for Salmon and Muskie!!!"
13498,kennyman,2006-12-18 04:12:00,737,"Let's start by qualifying my answer as a ""newbie"". I just started fishing alot this year. I guess I'm in the ""Anything"" camp, but what get's my heart really pounding and my knees shaking ..... fish with teeth. Pike or musky are my favorite so far, but I guess if a 6 or 7lb bass hit my line and tried pulling my arms off I'd like that too. I guess any fish that hits topwater would qualify for sure. I love that!"
13499,Mike the Pike,2006-12-18 04:12:00,3421,"walleye mostly,Pike bass,perch,trout. Love the look of a Garpike.I am yet to catch a steelhead,chinook,Lake trout and Muskie.My buddies named me Mike the Pike no explanation needed.When i go walleye fishing always end up with a pike .Casting for bass becomes pike fishing.LOL"
13520,wolfville,2006-12-18 05:15:00,396,"I only fished about 10 times for bass this year, but I probably fished over 150 times this year so far... Some of you already know what I went after in those 140+ times, if you don't already know you probably don't want to know anyway...."
13523,Rich,2006-12-18 05:19:00,3927,Well if you asked me 6 months ago I would have told you I'm a die hard bass guy. But after trying for and catching a variety of species this year I can honestly say I'm a multi-species angler. With a fetish for musky
13536,Greencoachdog,2006-12-18 09:36:00,8163,"Multi, multi, multi-species!   Life bis too short for me to just chase one kind of fish!"
13538,IanD,2006-12-18 10:01:00,16,"First love is chasing big pike. After that, if it swims, I'll chase it."
13541,lew,2006-12-18 10:28:00,12767,"I'm 99% a musky fisherman and when their in season, it's the only species I fish for.  In May, before musky opens,  I enjoy fishing for pickeral in the Kawarthas & Quinte (and hopefully tomorrow) and then in the winter I fish with Squid a few times on the Lower Niagara, and even the odd weekday salmon trip thrown in early in the season on Lake O  No interest in ice fishing though."
13543,SlowPoke,2006-12-18 11:04:00,2984,"For me the reward is in the fight, not the species. Having said that, I can get skunked and still have a good time on the water! -Brian"
