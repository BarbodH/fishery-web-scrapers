13683,Mike Pike,2006-12-18 17:16:00,1332,"...that deal to bring Pass Pro Shop to the Buffalo waterfront as part of huge multi-million dollar re-development project is off.  I guess the waterfront re-delelopment will go ahead, just not with Bass Pro.  It still could be a negotiating tool being used by Bass Pro, so I guess we'll have to wait and see.  I could see a lot of their customers coming from the Hamilton and Niagara area."
13688,Terry,2006-12-18 17:27:00,14456,"the deal was reported to have fallen through about 4 times with the toronto Basspro shop, and it happened without a shooting range/gun club, so it does seem to be a negotiating tool"
13727,misfish,2006-12-18 20:02:00,29133,"With the way the dollar is going and you were the TO bass pro owner,would you want one just an hours drive down the hwy?"
13731,Headhunter,2006-12-18 20:10:00,5703,Maybe we could convince them to build a Cabela's there instead!!! That would be worth the drive! HH
13732,SlowPoke,2006-12-18 20:16:00,2984,Nothing is worth the drive to Buffalo. -Brian
13736,misfish,2006-12-18 20:20:00,29133," LMAO SP.  There was a time though,it was worth driving down to see the bills play.LOL   Gander Mountian is there,man nice store,just way to cluttered I found.Also nothing like walking in and hold up a rifle to see how she feels.LOL"
13742,bpsbassman,2006-12-18 20:35:00,941,"Same guy owns them all Brian.  I would think that it would affect the Auburn, NY store more. Would still like to see it. It was supposed to be bigger than the TO store and have a restaurant as well as rumours the boats would be in the water and that they would also run charters out of it."
13756,fishdawg,2006-12-18 21:51:00,912,"well with Fishing World 30 minutes from me, Bass Pro 65 minutes & and a Gander mountain 25 minutes from me in NY, I am most interested in seeing a Cabelas built somewheres along this zone"
13802,daisy_girl58,2006-12-19 00:04:00,116,"I am from the city that originated Bass Pro, which is Springfield, Missouri. I went to the one there in Toronto and I was thoroughly disappointed. It is not that much comparable to the Missouri location. It seems to me a cheap imitation of what built Springfield and the community...  Lorissa"
13946,spanky,2006-12-19 04:26:00,195,how the heck fast do you guys drive?! ... takes me 1 1/2hrs to get to BPS from St. Kitts and an hour to get to Gander (love this store- clutter is mostly during huge clear outs and season changes- crazy deals tho  )... usually do 120km/h so you guys either have some lead feet or my speedo is way off LOL  i use BPS and Gander as reference points when i need to buy something... test it there and buy locally... with the larger selection 9//10 times i have to order from my local shop
13954,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 05:04:00,3382,"With the development deal for the casino falling apart and now BassPro not coming, it appears firefighting will have to remain Buffalo's top industry. Go Sabres!"
13970,pikehunter,2006-12-19 11:25:00,1659,I could hear the sighs of relief from tackle shop owners from Niagara to Burlington when I first heard the news. 
13975,tipupesox,2006-12-19 12:25:00,167,"Wow, plenty of Buffalo bashers on this board.  I live in the suburbs about 30 minutes from downtown Buffalo and find it sad that the government which runs the city can't get it together.  They have been talking about revitlaizing the waterfront since I was a young man, still have not seen any improvements.  With a viable resource at their door step,lake Erie, you would feel they would do everything possible to market that to improve the city's status.  But than again we are talking about politicians..........."
13987,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 12:58:00,3382,Politicians on this side of the river are no better. It is a universal constant.
13989,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 13:01:00,7971," LOL...How many times as a kid did you hear....  ""Fire in North Tonowanda....this is Irv Weinstein reporting, channel 4...."""
13993,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 13:13:00,3382,Irv was Channel 7. Irv was the best. Easily the best straight man on the news ever.
14050,charlesn,2006-12-19 15:28:00,551,"Lorissa,  The granddaddy in Sprinngfield is our Mecca.  No other Bass Pro compares.  The next best one I've been to was in Grapevine (DFW Texas), has a restaurant and the Big Buck Brewery attached to it and a couple o' mid to high teenagers living in the tank.  Truly astounding.  The next best one I've seen was just a few weeks ago in Nashville.  Tremendous stock and selection in a space comparable to the Toronto one.  The one near Detroit I recall being impressed with, but not overly impressed.  Not sure why, maybe it was too recently after the visit to Grapevine.  The Toronto one is okay, but after the recent visit to Nashiville, I'm once again reminded what a Bass Pro SHOULD look like in terms of having gear and popular items in stock.  The biggest weakness of the Toronto store is the people who are ordering the inventory ""might"" not be anglers so there is often a lot of stuff that needs to be ""clearanced"" and never what you are looking for.  For anyone looking for a vacation, the grand daddy in Missouri even has a clearance center beside it.  I'm a little afraid to go, I don't think my credit cards could handle it!  Charles"
