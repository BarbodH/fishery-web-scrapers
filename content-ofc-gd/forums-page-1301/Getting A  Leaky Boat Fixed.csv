13696,snackpack5150,2006-12-18 17:57:00,79,Hello all... got a 14ft alum boat that leaks a little wondering where I can get it fixed? Any thoughts and roughly how much would it run to have some rivets fixed.   Ken
13697,Fisherman,2006-12-18 18:00:00,7201,"Well give us a hand and explain roughly where it leaks. If it's under the seats, then you may well have to remove the seats to reset the rivets, a bit more work."
13698,Guest skeeter99,2006-12-18 18:02:00,0,you think I crazy saying this but it works real well and is cheap and can be done in about 2 hours   go to crappy tire and buy the pickup truck boxliner coating and apply to boat of aluminum boat and bingo no leaks fo $50  my buddy did this on his bush boat for kapuskasing we drag through the woods to remote lakes and dry as a bone like mew  It works reallly really well   Troy
13700,Entropy,2006-12-18 18:22:00,747,on the inside or outside? 
13702,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-18 18:36:00,0,reset the rivets....takes 2 guys but worth it. The other suggestion on box liner or undercoating works as well....TRY BOTH...
13709,irishfield,2006-12-18 19:06:00,26272,"Guess you missed the other 2 or 3 threads on the go about this! LOL  Biggest expense if you want to do it yourself...2 heavy hammers..a 5 lb sledge for the ""bucking bar"" and a 3 lb ball peen for the striking hammer.  The box liner trick will come back to bite you in the a$$ !"
13715,yellowboat,2006-12-18 19:19:00,211,What Irish said.
13730,Guest skeeter99,2006-12-18 20:09:00,0,in reply entropy u put it on the outside flip boat over and roll away   Troy  hey irish   it has been seven years on the bottom of the boat and drag around with atv's and not even a nick in the boxliner coating  I think it saved my buddy some $$ so he can buy the stuff to wipe his A$$
13743,irishfield,2006-12-18 20:37:00,26272,"What ever ""floats your boat"" I guess Troy. If it worked it worked but I sure wouldn't be doing it. Someone here on OFC went thru the nightmare of attempting to clean that stuff off of a hull and I'd imagine it wouldn't do anything for top end speed either."
13745,Entropy,2006-12-18 20:43:00,747,"Ya, I just picked up a 'free' boat with ... some black stuff all over the bottom, it now weights a lot... doesn't leak where it has been laid though."
13747,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-18 20:49:00,0,LOL....no one asked about weight....  ...just forget the undercoating if weight is an issue or speed for that matter....if will effect both in a big way.   
13749,irishfield,2006-12-18 20:52:00,26272,I'm praying Santa comes too Andy! LOL
