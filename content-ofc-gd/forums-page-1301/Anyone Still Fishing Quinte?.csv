13140,POLLIWOGG,2006-12-17 06:45:00,835,I haven't been in town this week but I suspect they're still at it.
13141,Hooked,2006-12-17 06:47:00,891,"My dad went up there on Friday, coming back Sunday.  I'll post here if he caught any.  They should be in big time though if anyone has a chance to head up there."
13144,Mike the Pike,2006-12-17 06:54:00,3421,I am pretty sure we will see some posting this evening.I fished today from shore with very little clothing and no gloves.Quinte I am sure is wide open no ice.  Looking at my boat covered up I wish had kept it ready to go under the carport.  Can't predict the weather.  looking forward to Quinte pics/  Mike
13155,Joey,2006-12-17 12:40:00,9122,Tybo and a buddy fished it yesterday while I Christmas shopped (and we all know how that turned out a couple of years ago  ).  He'll post his report in a bit.  Joey
13167,lew,2006-12-17 13:12:00,12767," Hey Jamie, if you can find a boat to take to Quinte, I'll join you for sure this week."
13172,DT10Sam,2006-12-17 13:40:00,480,"To quickly answer your question, the bite is still on and it is east of Glenora ferry to Thompson's Point.  All the walleye caught are 10 lb plus.  Reports have been great all week long.  Seems that deep divers are the way to go with boards.  The weather has been real good, no ice on any of the boat ramps and there does not seem to any bad weather coming in the next couple of days or so.  Hope this is of help to you.  Regards, Sam"
