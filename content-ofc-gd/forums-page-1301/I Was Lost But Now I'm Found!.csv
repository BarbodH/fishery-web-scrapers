13477,Mahumba,2006-12-18 03:33:00,28,Hey all!  Just registered. I had a heck of a time of viewing this board. (still on dial up here) but I just hung in there and did some work around the house while it loaded up.  Hope everyone is all ok and now that this is in the ol' cache I'll be checking in.  By the way.......is anyone looking for a cappacino machine? I got one real cheap. (DanC can tell ya about it Ha Ha)  Roger
13480,Gerritt,2006-12-18 03:41:00,6129,"Yup Roger the board is a little slower for alot of us... Due to design, graphics etc... on HS DSL here...   Welcome back! Been while since I heard from yah... how's the back etc?  Gerritt."
13486,Roy,2006-12-18 03:50:00,13728,"Hey, Raheem McHindu! How you be? We will soon have a 'no frills' skin for folks who are on dial up or just plain prefer a quicker interface."
13487,danc,2006-12-18 03:50:00,4677," Well, apparently it runs in the family. The cappacino machine blew up all over Rogers wifes hand yesterday. That was right before he ditched his plow truck removing snow from his neighbors driveway, which happened right before the truck died altogether. So, there's nothing new with Roger..."
13516,Joey,2006-12-18 04:54:00,9122,"Hey Rog, how ya been?  Sounds like life is treating you about the same  Drop in more often eh!  Joey"
13517,Carp,2006-12-18 04:55:00,1488,Welcome back dude.
13582,setomonkey,2006-12-18 13:51:00,872,"Hey, welcome back!  One of the things you can do to speed things up with dial-up is to set your browser not to download pictures. You'll see a red X for all the photos (avatars, post pics, etc.). If there's one you want to see, just ""right click"" it using your mouse and it will download just that one photo.  Mike"
13610,Mahumba,2006-12-18 14:35:00,28,"Thanks all!  Mike, One of the main reasons is to check out the pictures! See that one in the avatar......Cooler Girl (Joey)  Ha HA  Roger"
13612,lew,2006-12-18 14:39:00,12767,"Hey Roger, good to see you stopping by again bud, but what the heck ever happened to my glass musky baits your pal was making and wanted me to test drive ??  I've been sitting here waiting patiently for a couple years now and don't know how much longer I can stand the suspense"
13680,douG,2006-12-18 17:09:00,2693,"Great to hear from Mahumba again.  BTW, there is a thingy at the top right hand of the page that shows you if you have a PM.  Take a look there, 'k?"
