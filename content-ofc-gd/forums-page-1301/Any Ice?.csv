13769,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 22:12:00,7971,"The only ice I think I'll be seeing is in my drinks...or maybe in my freezer.  Sucks for ice fishing, but great if you hate snow!"
13799,Bernie,2006-12-19 00:00:00,3190,Fish Bay was wide open today---  no ice

13818,Rich,2006-12-19 00:31:00,3927,Keep lots of beer on ice and you'll have no need to fish.
13820,Carp,2006-12-19 00:33:00,1488,"Ice ?  What ice ?  Looks like it may be a late freeze up like last year. I don't care if it doesn't snow, but I hope we get a cold spell to make some good ice and cold nights to maintain it."
13862,Deano,2006-12-19 01:46:00,767,"It must be my fault, i finally bought a gas auger and was wanting to use it. Around the sudbury area, the lakes have open up in many places. We need some real cold to get some ice. I heard further up toward gogama and timmins theres ice, but I don't want to travel far for something we usually have."
13886,tjsa,2006-12-19 02:42:00,1578,"Have heard of one lake up here people are driving vehicles on, supposedly 8-10 inches(NOT ME, NO WAY) I don't think the ice is that solid yet, not black ice conditions up here that I know of. But quads and snowmobiles are OK on them.  Seeing the satellite pics, lots of our smaller walleye lakes are indeed frozen over, but the deeper laker lakes have open water on them.  Haven't been out myself yet, maybe this saturday for some late night walleye."
