13568,Fish Farmer,2006-12-18 13:19:00,2234,"Congrats on your first Bows. Your hooked now. Glad to see young anglers getting out. Then mom looking over the table at her son, Eating her sons catch. Lots of rewards I can see from a great sport. Should be more kids like yourself. Merry Christmas and may you catch more in the new year"

13678,urbanangler1990,2006-12-18 17:08:00,933," hey brick, i didnt have any roe, and snagged my last jig on a log, lol, all day ive been using pinkies, no need to change, that what i found out...  thnx guys for comments!"
13808,woodro,2006-12-19 00:19:00,168,"congrats dawg! pinkies are wicked baits, last season i think i caught just as many fish using pink worms as i did using roe bags. dont listen to the guys that are ripping on you for keeping your second rainbow ever, as long as you were in your legal limits, you ate it, and your mom enjoyed it, its all good hombre! hopefully we'll see you on the river"
