13467,PERCHER,2006-12-18 03:03:00,787,Any body have any ideas on how to remove these dents or know anyone who can remove them.When I got home from the Quinte get together I noticed this huge crease in the side of the boat.I don't know how it got there but its there.I try to keep the boat in as new condition as possible and now this .Can anybody help?
13469,Gerritt,2006-12-18 03:08:00,6129,people pay big bucks for that NIKE Swoosh!! LOL   sorry brother.... perhaps a rubber mallet and a soft touch?  but that is more then a dent it is a crease... much more difficult to remove without drilling holes and pulling it out...  Good luck!  Gerritt.
13472,irishfield,2006-12-18 03:09:00,26272,"The dock as someone leaned over to catch it!  Access available on the inside Dan?  ..what is this ""how to work with aluminum"" night?  Gerritt...you got the hair on my back up and an ill feeling happening..""drill holes and pull it out"""
13474,PERCHER,2006-12-18 03:20:00,787,Yes Wayne you can get to it from inside.And I believe you are right about the dock.
13475,irishfield,2006-12-18 03:27:00,26272,Well I'm leaving Tuesday am..but will be back Thur night late. You could bring it up Friday if you want and we can work it out...or some other convient time thru the winter/spring. Shouldn't be a big deal with a carpeted chunk of oak held tight on the outside and a flush face in my rivet gun on the inside.
13476,Bernie,2006-12-18 03:29:00,3190,Ouch- battle scar. I think if she were mine I would leave it be.   Trying to remove a crease like that may cause stress marks in the paint anyway. An autobody guy may be able to tell you better.
13478,Gerritt,2006-12-18 03:37:00,6129,Wayne... thats how I pulled a crease outta my car... the kit sold at CTC! lol  A boat is different I know... but then again I aint a sheet metal worker... I did high steel for awhile but hardly a sheet metal guy...   DanC might also chime in here... with a suggestion...  looks like a bad crease for sure I I would be worried about stress pulling it out vs. anything else considering its location....  might be best to just leave it???  Gerritt.
13479,PERCHER,2006-12-18 03:39:00,787,Thanks for the offer Wayne.I might just take you up on that in the spring.And maybe when we are done we can hit the lake and do some fishing?
13481,danc,2006-12-18 03:44:00,4677,"  I can make just about anything you want out of aluminum, but I'm no pro at fixing creases. Wayne has the right idea I'd say. But be careful as aluminum stresses and fractures easily. But I'm sure Wayne knows about that too. I'd probably just leave it. Tell everyone that a big Muskie made the crease.."
13482,Mahumba,2006-12-18 03:44:00,28,That crease is near impossible to remove. Aluminium doesn't take to stretching to much. If the paint is still there that's a good thing.  I wouldn't try to pound that out either. Like someone mentioned......Nike logo! Or some other graphic to cover it up.  Roger
13488,irishfield,2006-12-18 03:51:00,26272,Sounds like a plan Dan! LOL  Gerritt..we won't induce any stress into 5052 taking that back out properly...but like I said what do I know about aluminum.  The paint I can't guarantee...but I don't think we'll hurt it either.  Too bad we can't put the boat on it's side and run it back and forth thru the English Wheel ! It's also amazing what you can do with 1/2 a pound of lard and an oak rubbing stick.
13502,bpsbassman,2006-12-18 04:19:00,941,"I'd put my money on old Wayne. He sure did a good number on my boat all be it for another issue, but the da man do know aluminum"
13521,Ron,2006-12-18 05:17:00,1683,"I 'd trust Wayne's experience and suggestions before I would anyone elses on this one. (He's been know to fix a few on this site.) Shhh, don't tell em though, it'll go to his head."
13676,irishfield,2006-12-18 17:04:00,26272,Percher has nothing to lose Ron...well at least I don't! We'd go fishing first and then take a WACK at his boat afterwards! LOL
