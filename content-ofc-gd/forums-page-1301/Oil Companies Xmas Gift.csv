13998,Mike the Pike,2006-12-19 13:33:00,3421,I wonder why the Oil companies are increasing the barrel again.Could it be the low demand for heating fuel.The hurricane season is long gone and it was a tame season.Perhaps the demand has increased from late fall boat use .There is no excuse for the sudden increase.Perhaps it is just another way to increase profits during the final Quarter of the year.Yesterday in Montreal 94 cents per litre today it is $1.02.00.  Give me a break.Mike

14009,Garyv,2006-12-19 13:47:00,547,"Last week NYMEX trading per barrel was on the increase caused by OPEC'S decision to lower production quotas in Feburary, therefore our friends increased their price to us.  Yesterday ( Monday ) the price per barrel dropped $1.22 a barrel closing at $62.21.  The rest of the week will be intresting to watch."
14022,Deano,2006-12-19 14:19:00,767,there was a big (explosion) fire at the sarnia plant last week. http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...1214?hub=Canada funny thing is it has dissapeared and no mention of the cause.
14032,Garyv,2006-12-19 14:46:00,547, Living in the area releases and small flares are quite normal but with this explosion it's amazing no one was hurt or killed.  They still have not found out the cause and it may take some time due to the damage.  The output of that facility wouldn't put a huge dent in overall production but it may have had a slight affect on prices.  I can tell you that US border security was elevated for a short time but by the time I went across later in the day it was back to normal.  When I came back into Canada the sky was still smokey and there were particles of fine ash floating around at 4:30 in the afternoon.
