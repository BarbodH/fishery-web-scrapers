Also once I got the eggs off i put them in a ziplock container not bag. What should i add to it? or just put it in the freezer? TIA  Alex"
13413,Gerritt,2006-12-18 01:41:00,6129,That is called Skien... and depending on the size of the eggs and how much time you want to devote to picking the eggs out....  you can also just fish with the Skien as well...   perhaps one of the more experianced Steelheaders will be chiming in soon.

13417,Fisherman,2006-12-18 01:48:00,7201,"It all depends how ""ripe"" the eggs are.  You can very carefully scrape the eggs off the membrane with a dull spoon and then process them, or cut up small chunks, dime size, and store them that way.  They should be rinsed in stream water, not clorinated tap water.  Some guys will cure them with a variety of egg cures, you can buy it in the store, some use a home brew of borax and brown sugar. My son freezes them in small batches in pill containers.  Good luck."

13663,Basskicker,2006-12-18 16:04:00,421,As for curing eggs...there are hundreds of recipes on the internet....I've tried quite a few but this one is by far the best I've used.  It is also amazing on salmon in the fall in slack water....enjoy.... or ya the only place that I've found the anise oil is Bulk Barn.  http://www.thefishingoddess.com/AngieEggCure_page.htm   Jason
