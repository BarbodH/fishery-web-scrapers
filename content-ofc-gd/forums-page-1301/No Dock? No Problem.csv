13913,irishfield,2006-12-19 03:17:00,26272,I could just imagine what that would do to the hull when the winds/waves kick in!  If you can get that on the shoreline just back your trailer in and leave it instead!
13921,PERCHER,2006-12-19 03:27:00,787,Maybe if I had that at Quinte only the bottom of my boat would have got dented and I would never ever have seen it.And then it wouldn't bother me so much.
13950,Fisherman,2006-12-19 04:42:00,7201,"Unless you have that ""dock"" out of the water far enough to stop wave action from slamming the boat around, I would really not trust it for one minute.  I would be more tempted to use an old bunk trailer, not something you would leave there unattended."
14266,fishindevil,2006-12-19 23:12:00,6254,"yes fisherman,thats what i was thinking too,rick you would need a smooth decent shoreline too and you almost have to pull it right out or the waves will was right over the transom...im not likin it rick...lets send one to the bad people that do bad things to our board...lol...lol..."
