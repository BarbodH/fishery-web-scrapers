13452,PERCHER,2006-12-18 02:35:00,787,Its a sad thing to see any animal suffer.
13554,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 12:43:00,7971,Very sad story...esp since it struggled for so long.     This probably happens a lot more than we think...esp in warm winters like this.  Sorry you had to witness it.

We were flat lining and our troll took us past a very productive point several times. Each time we passed, we couldn't help but notice the rotten odor in the air. Finally, we noticed a half rotten moose that apparently suffered the same fate as the moose that you saw. The ice had only been gone for a week or so before we got there so I assume that the moose broke through the thin ice near shore and couldn't pull himself out, as the shore was still covered in ice and snow. Such is nature. I'm not sure that this has anything to do with global warming as there will always be such situations every spring and fall."
