13500,snag,2006-12-18 04:12:00,1932,Stop it!  You two are out of control!!!  Wow etc.  What kind of walleye aphrodisiac are you spraying on your lures???  Way to go guys.  I love it when nice people prosper.  
13508,Carp,2006-12-18 04:38:00,1488,"I just can't stop dreaming about those beauty walleye you two are nailing.  Keep at it as long as you can. If you keep beating your personal bests, I can see an 18 + lber soon."
13515,moemoe,2006-12-18 04:54:00,352,Nice fish!
13524,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 05:28:00,7971," It's funny you mention that....this one fought like crazy.  I mentioned to my wife ""It's fighting like crazy...must be a small one"".  We've found the 12 plus pounders are so lethargic that they are like logs coming in after about a minute of fighting.  The 9 to 11 pounders seem to have more fight in them.  I then saw it surface and I didn't say another word...I knew it very well could have been my personal best and I switched to full concentration mode.  Once it came in and I saw how FAT he was, I looked like a deer caught in the headlights...couldn't believe how big he was."
13589,dustink,2006-12-18 14:09:00,526,Wow...another great report!!  Looking forward to the next one!  dk
13607,fishnsled,2006-12-18 14:35:00,3520,Great report again!!!  I haven't seen anyone else that has beat their personal bests as many times as you two have done.  CONGRATS!!!!    And have a MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!
13761,ccmtcanada,2006-12-18 22:04:00,7971, Weather permitting.....you may be right.   I can only hope!!!

Please tell me(us), what was the magical lure?"
13185,ccmtcanada,2006-12-17 14:21:00,7971,"Ok...I know we posted a season ending report a few weeks ago, but with all the mention on the board as to how hot the action still is in Picton, and this awesome mid-December weather, we just had to go out a few times.  Here is a little summary of our success....starting with this ""little"" guy.  Blyght's 8.5 pound, 30"" length x 15"" girth   Next came my 11 pounder, 30.5"" x 17"" girth   Now they got BIG!!! Here's Carole's 14 pounder, 31"" x20"" girth   Now...for the first time, I have the biggest fish of one of our reports!!! This was a 14.5 pound, 32"" x 19"" new personal best for me!  While Christmas shopping ""for the kids"", I stopped in at a local tackle shop and bought a new lure....I had a good feeling about it!!!   All of the toothy critters swam away...to spend Christmas with their families....eat tons of food...and we'll try to meet up with them again next year.....hehe"

13243,huntervasili,2006-12-17 17:07:00,1604,thanks for the great report... Second best to getting on the water....
13256,ccmtcanada,2006-12-17 17:37:00,7971," Wow...thanks for your great comment!  We never really thought of it the way you explain it here.  We're actually flattered that people remember the details of our year!  We just love going out...spend some time together, and not sit like silent vegetables staring at the TV....LOL.  I know that if my wife wasn't into fishing as much (or more) than me, that I wouldn't get out there nearly as much.  If the weather holds up, hopefully we'll have more reports....until then....we'll keep crossing our fingers!  Thanks again!"
13261,fishindevil,2006-12-17 17:42:00,6254,"WOW....you guys sure put the time in fishing at the docks in picton,those fish are friggin amazing its incredible to catch fish like that from shore way to go and congrats on your effort and hard work,those are all trophy walleyes no matter where you fish people like me have chased walleye all my life to get6 fish like that ....   congrats on your new PB..im sure we will be hearing more reports from you guys in the near future...merry xmas.."

13279,Moosebunk,2006-12-17 18:30:00,3970,"What you don't realize is CCM is a Hobbit who dwells down in the Shire near the River Gumbleberryhumdingerwalleye.  The fish are only 4lb'ers but in his Hobbit hands look lke 14.5's.  See, if you note he only has 3 fingers...... Hobbit for sure.  "
13281,Clampet,2006-12-17 18:42:00,1947,"Beauty report!!  Thanks for sharing, it's good that you included the fishs' weight along with the length and girth, it gives us an idea of the size difference between an 8 pounder and a 14 pounder."
13284,b2kptbo,2006-12-17 18:53:00,1505,"Good stuff, man""o'man musta bin some good tugs on the line..."
13315,Joey,2006-12-17 20:57:00,9122,"Beauty!!!!  I just can't believe the weather right now.  Perfect for fishing, and you two are cleaning up man!  Joey"
13323,Bernie,2006-12-17 21:35:00,3190,"O wow!!!! I wish we could catch fish that size on Nipissing.(they are rare that size here).Good stuff and great pics. -----Moosebunk, that was totally funny!!"
13328,ccmtcanada,2006-12-17 21:49:00,7971, Oh great...now everyone will know there are Walleye at Picton...thanks fishindevil....LOL
13332,Bly,2006-12-17 22:04:00,1556," Ok, my secret is out, I might as well confess........the real reason all our pictures are at night, the real reason we are never in the same photo, and the real reason we catch ""big"" fish........ Ccmt is a hobbit.  His real name is Grigory Bolger and yes, we do live in the Shire.    Thank you Moosebunk for outing him, it is such a relief, now he can be himself.  By the way, that 4 pounder was actually 4.25     That is a BIG difference for ""little people"".

13366,motv8tr,2006-12-17 23:42:00,2587,Great stuff you guys!  Those are some sweet fish for sure!  Glad to see you're taking advantage of this amazing weather.  Thanks  Maureen
13373,Crazyhook,2006-12-17 23:51:00,1154,what beauty fish! you two sure had a great fall congrats
13389,Matt15,2006-12-18 00:37:00,107,Nice fish
13443,jediangler,2006-12-18 02:26:00,1923,"Another great report, and good on ya for releasing them back to spawn more of the same. The big ones don't taste as good anyway. When I spent a few days at Quinte, several years back, you could see the colour of the meat changed from white to pinkish when the fish were bigger than 3.5lbs."
13463,FishFinder,2006-12-18 02:59:00,481,Great report as always
