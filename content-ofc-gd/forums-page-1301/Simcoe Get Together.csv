10900,huntervasili,2006-12-11 15:29:00,1604,well maybe even a two day thing could be possible where those who can come only one day do and the other day the same... cause I doubt everyone who wants to go can make it on the same day... May be less people but much more convinient... Just a thought
10901,knotaclue,2006-12-11 15:29:00,136,"sounds great, let me know if i can bring anything"
10935,Terry,2006-12-11 17:00:00,14456,"13 sounds good to me  as long as I have a date,I'm good,  many plans are already in the works for the winter, if the ice comes"
10952,PERCHER,2006-12-11 18:20:00,787,It is now set Jan 13th 2007..If there is ice.As time draws closer we will decide were and when.I am thinking the end of Gilford rd.Pick up our bait from Peter at Ice Cabins and go.Peter has a party hut he leaves open for people to warm up in for those who maybe open air fishing.I will make arrangements with him.Any other suggestions let us know.Dan
10966,Terry,2006-12-11 19:20:00,14456,sounds like a plan
11059,glen,2006-12-11 23:59:00,2641,I am in.  But how far out do we have to go?  Cause i aint got no ride.
11065,PERCHER,2006-12-12 00:11:00,787,Glen its  not are a far walk at all 10 maybe 15 minutes at the most.I always walk out.
11213,motv8tr,2006-12-12 12:46:00,2587,"Well I won't be able to make that date as I'll be working, I really hope you gusy have some ice for that date.  As for me, my vacation is booked fr a week in Feb. and I am in the planning stages for our 3rd annual fishing for Tyler on Feb 24th as Wayne said.  I figured to wait until after the holidays to post more about it, but if you want to know a little take a look at the link in my signature...  Maureen"
11217,Terry,2006-12-12 12:58:00,14456,"Maureen, I think you should post a bit about it including the date I already have 5 weekends booked and I am sure many others are starting to set dates too, so the earlier you let people know the less conflicts with other outings...just my thoughts"
11302,fishnsled,2006-12-12 17:15:00,3520,I'm in for the 13th as well!
11709,brickNblock,2006-12-13 16:06:00,598,An exellent idea. Cooks Bay is an absolute blast for a family g2g. All members of my family get out for the hard water fishing. We are deffinitely doing Maureens g2g for Tyler too!!!..last year was fun for all.
11880,Rattletrap2,2006-12-13 23:47:00,1652,Jan 13th is pencilled in....pending ice conditions! Things had better turn around real soon. We are in double digits today and looking at 8 degrees through Saturday!
12431,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 05:04:00,3421,Well ya I am in 666kms drive to go perch fishing.looks like I will be bringing the boat.I will be setting up the 2 man Frabill in the boat.Ice Ice Ice we must pray for some ice  ask   for some ice.Keep the    away he will melt the ice.
12536,irishfield,2006-12-15 15:11:00,26272,"I've got a nice circle cutter for aluminum, Mike, that works very nice in a cordless drill. Cuts holes to 12 inches!"
12574,lilkynan,2006-12-15 17:35:00,173,Yea-call me when it is time
12750,crappieperchhunter,2006-12-15 23:43:00,2582,Jan 13 works for me. That's my weekend off. Looking forward to meeting some OFC folks. Bring on the ice !!!
12830,pigeonfisher,2006-12-16 03:16:00,696,"dumb question I am sure...if the water was open, is it legal to fish from your boat during the Jan. 01-March 31 (or whenever the closing is) time period?  WHY would we even have to consider it?  Boat...January? Other than fast flowing water it should be closed up, maybe that is not the fuure and cold water jigging from the boat will be the new ice fishing?"
12898,fishdawg,2006-12-16 12:45:00,912,no reason why you couldnt fish from a boat - no different then soem of the boats that fish the open waters of Quinte duuring the winter - of course you are only allowed one/angler in the bat
13893,PERCHER,2006-12-19 02:50:00,787,Well guys it looks like it may end up being Jan 13 2008.Were the heck is the cold weather?
13897,jeffw,2006-12-19 03:02:00,267,Count me in if we actually have ice then. cheers Jeff
13900,Mike the Pike,2006-12-19 03:05:00,3421,Lets go back to the BOQ.Take the boats back out.Will we have a choice????????????//
13928,Dondorfish,2006-12-19 03:37:00,1000,I'm with you Mike - after seeing all the reports coming out of quinte the last few days - who wants to mess around with perch!  Don
10389,PERCHER,2006-12-10 05:22:00,787,I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in a one day get together on Simcoe for a day of perching .It would be nice if we could bring our family's.Maybe Cooks Bay it usually has the first SAFE ice.Any body up for it maybe in January.Dan
10418,Terry,2006-12-10 12:46:00,14456,sounds like a great idea to me
10424,dsn,2006-12-10 13:00:00,1018,Sounds like a Good idea to me. I'm in for now. Not sure how I'll get there though I have no ride. LOL Plus I can't say what I'll be doing then too far off.    dsn
10452,brifishrgy,2006-12-10 14:29:00,559,sounds like a good idea... the way the weather is going might have to wait till February
10456,MuskyBill,2006-12-10 14:43:00,311,"Count me in, I love Cooks Bay Perchin'...."
10459,Dondorfish,2006-12-10 14:49:00,1000,Count me in to - sounds like fun.   Don
10523,PERCHER,2006-12-10 16:46:00,787,"We will have to keep an eye open for ice conditions and when its starts getting at least 8""we can then pick our date.For those who own portables bring them and others can rent if they wish.But if it turns out to be a real nice day huts won't be required.I might be able to set up a deal with Peter at Ice Cabins out of Gilford.I know he has a mobile restaurant service that would come in handy.We could also hire him for transportation services."
10526,ChrisK,2006-12-10 16:52:00,2772,Thought I would pin this one up folks....  I'll defenetely try to make it this year....  Cheers !!
10529,Ron,2006-12-10 16:54:00,1683,"Sure!  Only thing is, I gots lots on the plate as it is now. Crap the season hasn't begun and I already got 3 weekends booked. Plus the Month of February is fully booked now too with fishing related items. There are some days I wonder why my wife still loves me!"
10550,TAH,2006-12-10 17:16:00,133,and don't forget about the annual OFC fund raiser that is usually held in February   TH
10559,irishfield,2006-12-10 17:34:00,26272, Are ya ever home long enough to find out Ron?  Maureen's Ice Fishing for Tyler event is Feb 24th if I remember correctly. Maureen will pipe in sooner or later I'm sure.  Spiel...hurry up and get your '07 shift schedule bud...it's gettin busy.....
10569,Rizzo,2006-12-10 17:59:00,4754,"why not, I need a new avatar photo, taken last time I made it out to simcoe for a meet and greet (about 4 years ago)"

10647,Spiel,2006-12-10 21:56:00,9065," ...Should know in a week or two Wayne (I hope?).  As for getting out on Cooks for perching, well it's usually my first ice outing. If I'm off I'll likely be there!"
