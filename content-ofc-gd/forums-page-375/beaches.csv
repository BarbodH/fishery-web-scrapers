Grand Bend is a good beach but alot more traffic and people.Plus you have to pay to park. Port Glasgow also has a beach that seldom has many using it."
721807,Grimace,2012-08-11 13:28:00,2020,Lake Huron Beaches are nicer in my opinion.  The kids will have fun splashing in the waves that the west winds provide and the sunsets can be astounding as they set in the west on the horizon of the water.
721810,shane,2012-08-11 13:38:00,652,Ipperwash beaches are really nice and much less crowded than Grand Bend. No lifeguards though.
721811,largemouthtrout,2012-08-11 13:39:00,53,"I prefer The Pinery Provincial Park in Grand Bend . There is a good spot on the highway between the Pinery and Grand Bend for ice cream and pizza ( can't remember the name .. but it's hard to miss ) . It is on the lake side of the highway . The pavillion at the pinery also has decent burgers and fries .  There is a river that runs thru the park also . I have never fished in it , but it looks good for fishing and canoeing ."
721812,gino,2012-08-11 13:50:00,400,"i like Huron better than Erie for a day at the beach with the family. Water is much more cleaner, sand is really nice...any of the options mentioned above are much better than Erie.Enjoy!"

721945,spinnerbaitking,2012-08-12 00:04:00,1622,"Chantry Derby in Kincardine ends tomorrow at noon you could go a little further & see some nice fish being weighed in also, Lake Huron either way, we were at Goderich last Monday with our Grand Daughters & they enjoyed it very much Tight Lines SBK"
722028,iFish4real,2012-08-12 12:13:00,386,Huron all the way !!!
722065,reelinrolly,2012-08-12 14:26:00,281,Canatara beach in sarnia is also nice.  You can take the kids under the blue water bridge for fries as well. Not to mention feeding the fish at the blue water anglers hatchery tank. I may be biased since I live in sarnia lol
722082,adempsey,2012-08-12 16:07:00,1498,"I prefer Lake Huron as well.  So any beach on that water would be my choice.  However, Port Stanley is a bit closer."
722097,scugpg,2012-08-12 18:13:00,1373,Lake huron gets my vote too. The pinery has a nice beach and isn't much further than pt stanley

722179,hotsky,2012-08-13 01:52:00,400,Long Point beach is hard to beat IMO.
722215,bow slayer,2012-08-13 04:42:00,1074,"huron beaches are no more cleaner than Pt.Stanley, large hog operations in huron county have led to increased e-coli levels on many beaches in huron county.  http://environmentaldefence.ca/articles/blue-flag-coveted-rating-evidence-lake-erie-much-cleaner-now-years-past"
722216,colin519,2012-08-13 06:01:00,101,"Depends on the day you want. There's something to be said for a secluded stretch of beach on Huron near Bayfield. Port Stanley is a bit more small beach town, Grandbend if you wanna play 'Who Let the Dogs out' from your Jeep Wrangler. Long Point or Rondeau can be nice for wilderness and beaches. Pinery as well of course."
