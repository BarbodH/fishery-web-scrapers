723765,jimmy v,2012-08-19 23:47:00,33,"Spent a couple of days down at Port Bruce walleye fishing.Lots of eyes,3 distinct year classes-(1-2 pounders,4-5 pounders and some 9-10 pounders).Got to get out to 67 feet of water-it`s a long way(17 miles) but they were there in great numbers! Down 50-60 feet,riggers and dipsies were best.Spoons and ripplin redfins worked the best.Darker colors right away,then brighter colors started to go.Fish seem to be heading southwest in a hurry! Also a few salmon have moved into the harbor at Owen Sound,defintely not many-casted for 4 hours,saw 4 jump ended up landing 1 about 11 pounds.Heading to Lake O for salmon this week as they are staging at most ports."
