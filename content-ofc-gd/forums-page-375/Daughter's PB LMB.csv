723149,Cudz,2012-08-17 02:38:00,2652,THis is my middle daughter's PB LMB.  SHe is 9 years old and the fish was all hers from the cast to the fight (great fight).  THe only thing I did was net it and take the hook out.

723152,kickingfrog,2012-08-17 02:46:00,8333,Shouldn't you be takin' them (and yourself) clothes shopping???  Nice fish. I'm sure she'll always remember that fish.

723167,Cudz,2012-08-17 04:23:00,2652,Easy Rob I still have well over 2 weeks of vacation left. I don't even know what number of the month it is and haven't for about a month now.
723168,Cudz,2012-08-17 04:25:00,2652,"Nope, didn't get a weight. I am usually pretty good at guess and I would say around 3.5 pounds.  It might have been 4+ if it was a bit chunkier."
