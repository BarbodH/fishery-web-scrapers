It is a big lake and the best fishing is on the mid to northern stretches, didn't feel like doing the 20-30 mile runs in the boat with the kids so we stuck to the south portion and it was pretty good for keeping the kids busy. We located some rocky points that held lots of small SMB, no records but you hooked one every cast once you located them we would get about 30 off of each of these points when we located them. Lots of SMB around but never got anything of major size but I was concerned with keeping the kids busy with fish, mission accomplished with hook and worm or worm tipped jigs. Never got into any pike or walleye but some guys coming back from the northern parts had some nice looking walleye. Had to do my best John Candy impression one night when a bat flew into the cottage and the kids had a blast with the chipmunks taking peanuts right out of their hands. They were amazed to see a hummingbird and a woodpecker for the first time.It was nice to spend the week with the family with no cellphones or internet to distract us. Decent place for the price and cabins are going under renovations so should be pretty nice in the next couple years, thanks Serge and Tuula at Northwoods for a nice week.   Chipmunk Feeding   Average catch     Girl catching too   On the bridge at the French River Rest Area  Can't wait to get up north again soon."
