714772,snagged,2012-07-15 23:42:00,67,My baitcaster is not as butter smooth as it used to be.  It needs to be cleaned and oiled.  Where can I bring it (I live in the GTA)?   Tia
714776,bigbuck,2012-07-15 23:48:00,2449,Aikmans in mississauga. Near dundas and hwy 10.
717749,snagged,2012-07-25 16:22:00,67,"Big thanks to Ah_Long who is a member on here.  He serviced my steez baitcaster and now its smoother than ever.  Also got my daiwa outta luck serviced with a clean and boca bearing upgrade   I'm a very happy camper.  BTW, your rod and reel collection was a real treat to look at"
717751,kickingfrog,2012-07-25 16:29:00,8333,Did he pimp it out as well?
717773,ah_long,2012-07-25 18:04:00,354," I would pimp your reel out as well...  no seriously, I have some guys who already contacted me for some winter project ideas..."
717776,kickingfrog,2012-07-25 18:20:00,8333," I'm seriously thinking about it. Although I'm more of a all go, no show kind of guy, so I'll just want the bearings upgraded."
717778,johnnyb,2012-07-25 18:27:00,3413,"Okay AhLong....sounds like you're getting quite the reputation...and from the looks of your collection and vids, I'd say it's well deserved   Do you touch spinning reels, or strictly baitcasters?"
717779,sandmann,2012-07-25 18:29:00,51,"My new bearings feel great. He's got all the parts to pimp a reel out as far as u wanna go  Warning, looking at his modified gear will make u wanting more lol"
717924,ah_long,2012-07-26 03:38:00,354,I strictly do baitcasters at this moment..  a full reel service from me is a bit different than Aikmans.. all the following are done when I do a full service of a reel:  disassembly of the entire reel degrease everything flush and inspect bearings ultrasonic cleaning oil/re-lube bearings and gears reassembly
724097,FrankTheRabbit,2012-08-21 02:19:00,479,"Hey peeps,  I just wanted to vouch for Ah_long in his service with my Quantum Smoke bait cast reel. Super knowledgeable and if my reel were like my own flesh and blood, I'd have no worries that he would take very good care of it.  I don't think my Smoke reel is anything to pimp out on, but if I ever acquire a high end reel, I know he will come up with the best way possible to pimp it out.  Many thanks man. I know we will cross paths again!"
