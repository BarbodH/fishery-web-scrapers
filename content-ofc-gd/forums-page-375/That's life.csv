723598,Roy,2012-08-19 13:36:00,13728,Or something significant like:  Today I was wondering if it's the round lip or the square lip that gives you the widest wobble on a crankbait.
723674,glen,2012-08-19 18:04:00,2641,Ya but the wife figures out a way to cheer me up.
723702,Rich,2012-08-19 20:25:00,3927,My girlfirend just assumes it's because i'm not fishing.

723718,iFish4real,2012-08-19 21:26:00,386,"In my opinion, you can tell the wife abt the motorcycle but...there's to versions of the consequences  1. She's gonna make a scene: ""Oh my God, that's all you were thinking about all this time? You don't care about how I feel? You don't talk to me? You love the motorcycle more then me?...All you care about is that damn thing...and start crying 2 A smart wife, like Glen mentioned up here, gives you a good BJ when you go to bed, then you tell her how much you love her and you both go to sleep HAPPY"

I was thinking, and I was watching the wind on the trees.  A couple minutes later, my wife looks at me and then says: ""Are you thinking about going fishing?"""
