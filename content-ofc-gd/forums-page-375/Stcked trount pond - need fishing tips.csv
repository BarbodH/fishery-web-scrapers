722916,hotsky,2012-08-16 13:49:00,400,"I'm going to fish at a stocked pond for rainbow trout and bass this weekend, but I never fished for trout before. I have a few Mepps Syclops lures that I use for pike but know they are also good for salmon. I'm guessing they would work well there too? I have a little bit of everything in my tackle box and will be fishing from shore (small pond) with my GF so need some tips on locating the fish and what lures and techniques to use. Thanks."
722920,Oryx,2012-08-16 13:52:00,186,I've always had luck with Panther Martin's for rainbows
722925,Broker,2012-08-16 14:05:00,482,Im sure a good worm will work for both bass and bows. Even more so because its a stocked trout pond the fish wont have the same eating habits as the wild fish.
722938,Musky or Specks,2012-08-16 16:02:00,2710,Is this a pay to fish stocked pond? If so anything that looks like Purina Trout Chow (now called Aquamax) will get them going.
722975,hotsky,2012-08-16 19:27:00,400,Its in a conservation area. Id rather use lures will the syclospes work?
722977,Broker,2012-08-16 19:28:00,482,The trout would be kinda hard to get from shore ..
722980,capt bruce,2012-08-16 19:33:00,820," This is a stocked pond these fish have eaten trout chow all their lives . Any way you dont want to catch to many as in these ponds the trout are catch and KEEP and at the prices per inch and I see you trying to save money on boat and fish finder etc. you should hope to NOT CATCH MANY as five of these fish will buy you that watch fish finder easy .. Lures MAY work but these fish will average 1 to 2 pounds , stick to corn ,trout pelets or worms ..This is like fishing in your bath tub , ..."
722981,adolson,2012-08-16 19:37:00,783," Do you have any Little Cleos? I don't know much about pond fishing (only did it once as a kid in winter, and we used a hook and piece of corn.. But I suspect we could have used a bare hook). However, I've caught lots of brook trout from stocked lakes using those, as well as small Panther Martins. Mepps #3 dressed work well too, though I've not caught on those (fishing partners have).  I wouldn't know about the Syclops - I've casted them a bit but never had a hit."
722995,Rich,2012-08-16 20:00:00,3927,"Big O crankbaits work very well in the stocked conservation areas i fish, provided they are deep enough. Otherwise a panther martin #3 is your best bet. Gold blade, orange fur."
722997,Rich,2012-08-16 20:01:00,3927,"But, p.s. - nothing beats a live worm once the fish are used to their reservoir surroundings. Good luck!"
723014,craigdritchie,2012-08-16 21:16:00,1586,"A lot of the fish you find in stocked ponds are fairly small, so keep lures small as well. I've always done well with a number one Mepps. Small Panther Martins work well. So do small crappie jigs.  Anything large enough to interest bass or salmon will often scare the crap out of pond trout.  Use a live worm, either on bottom or under a float. It catches everything."
723019,paul_614,2012-08-16 21:29:00,168,Find out the pond depth and set a slip float so that your worm is just off bottom. Even ask if the sides drop straight down or gradually slope. My girls and I did well in a stocked pong near Niagara falls a few weeks ago fish bottom with worms
723076,hotsky,2012-08-16 23:22:00,400,Thanks guys. Will twisters work?
723079,fishinmortician,2012-08-16 23:32:00,100,Last pond I took the kids too almost broke the bank. Of course a 5 lb'er took the first cast!  Good luck and bring lots of money
723088,hotsky,2012-08-16 23:48:00,400,"I called and they only charge like $10 to get in the park and you can keep 2, no extra pay."
723089,davey buoy,2012-08-16 23:54:00,5505,I wouldn't know about the Syclops - I've casted them a bit but never had a hit.    Me too .

723204,hotsky,2012-08-17 13:40:00,400,"I read somewhere that stocked trout like shrimp too, so ill try that. About corn do i put it on a hair rig  like for carp or straight on a hook?"
723212,Christopheraaron,2012-08-17 14:12:00,3525, Right on the hook...
723250,Rattletrap2,2012-08-17 17:16:00,1652,"I used to fish the ponds at Glen Haffy many years ago. A small ""0"" or ""1"" Mepps, Panther Martin, or Olympique type spinner would usually work well. Drive by it most week days now and never give it a try!"
723346,Christopheraaron,2012-08-17 23:12:00,3525,I forget is it catch and release at glen haffy? I'm looking for a place to catch good fighting fish (trout) easily for a younger kid.
723349,gaspumper,2012-08-17 23:20:00,393,"If your stocked trout pond's are anything like ours are the trout jump out of the water after your bait as you try to put your line in the water.The speckles are at least 12-15 inches,so the price adds up pretty fast."
