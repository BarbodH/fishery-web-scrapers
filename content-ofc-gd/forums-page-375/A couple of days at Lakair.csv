721919,motv8tr,2012-08-11 22:06:00,2587,"I went up to Lakair for a couple of days and took my best friend and her two boys, their first fishing trip.  It was really nice to see Joey, Paul,Roy, J, Joe, Art, Lew and Dianne, their daughter Sherry, it was also nice to meet Joey's son Al and Roy's son Phil.  The weather was pretty good for Wed and Thurs, Fri, it was overcast for a good part of the day, then it rained from 4pm and didn't stop until early morning Sat.  Unfortunately as a result I couldn't take the boys out fishing before we left, so I will try to get them out one more time this season.  They had an awesome time, and I really enjoyed watching their reactions to everything they saw and did....as they say pictures say a thousand words, so I'll let them tell the rest for me  Home away from home   Legolas's Castle   Ralphie   Size does matter  This is Roy's motor   Wow!   First ride in the boat   First ride ever in a Bass Boat   Marvin watching over the boys   Kaelebs first Pike, caught off the dock   What it's all about   Loon   I would like to thank everyone for helping to make this such a memorable trip for the boys, especially Art for taking them out for a ride on your boat, and Joey for letting Kaeleb try his first fresh fish....they will be talking about this trip for a long long time, and are already asking when they can go back  I will post a few more photos a little later on  Maureen"

721921,Rich Clemens,2012-08-11 22:09:00,3131,Good times Mo.   Sorry you couldn't make up in June.
721931,Joey,2012-08-11 23:14:00,9122,"Great photos and trip report Moe.  Was nice to see you again and meet your friend, her sons and the dog.  We are home now and I'm just uploading the pics for a report"
721932,Leecher,2012-08-11 23:14:00,7832,Awesome Maureen    Sounds like you and the boys had a Great time
721936,motv8tr,2012-08-11 23:21:00,2587,"  I figured you got home before me as you passed us as we got back on the highway after a stop at Tim Hortons in Parry Sound, and that was after a stop at the Moose Lake trading post...lol  Glad you made it safely home  Maureen"
721948,Rich Clemens,2012-08-12 00:14:00,3131,"Ha ha ha.   MooseLake is one of my ""Required"" stops each time we come up"

722073,woodenboater,2012-08-12 15:04:00,2277,"Good to hear you and your friend had a nice time up there, I trust everyone liked staying in the wall tent ? Also can't beat hitting pike off the dock, that must have been cool for him.   I always just motor past that place but if you and Maureen give it the thumbs up, well I guess I know where I'll be pulling over next time !"
722140,motv8tr,2012-08-12 22:49:00,2587,"The tent was good, except for the sqeaky door, I kept waking everyone up in the morning as I am an early riser....they are not  We stopped at both French River Trading Post and Moose Lake, more for my friend than me, I'm not a shopper.  Her boys sure were happy leaving there though, they somehow managed to find something at both places...imagine   If you like fudge though, there's good stuff to be found at Moose Lake"
722319,aplumma,2012-08-13 19:30:00,6896,Thanks again for the excellent dinner Thursday and the great company. Just so you know the dog was I-I close to getting a new home South of the border.  Art and Joe
