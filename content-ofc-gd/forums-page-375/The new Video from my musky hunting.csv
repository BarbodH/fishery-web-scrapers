722810,Handlebarz,2012-08-15 21:18:00,3790,Thanks all I'm happy with the way it turned out I just need to remember where to put the rod and my hands or try to angle the camera differently when boat side or during the figure 8.

723085,Handlebarz,2012-08-16 23:37:00,3790,I want to get another Gopro with the dive housing and have it recording underwater just beside the boat most days you can see to the bottom. Even in the stained water that day I had 3' I could see.
723107,Rizzo,2012-08-17 00:34:00,4754,here I thought I was the only guy crazy enough to fish musky barefoot! Great video
723124,Handlebarz,2012-08-17 01:06:00,3790,It's funny the looks I get in November when I am out there in cutoffs and shorts. The best was when I was telling the MNR I thought they were crazy going out when the weather was so bad it was blowing the lake had 3-4' waves and I was heading out in my summer cloths both MNR officers looked at me like I was nuts
