I've been down the river dozens of times and I'm looking but i want to go explore new areas.  Does anyone know off any other rivers around kennisis that may be worth exploring."
724010,dave524,2012-08-20 21:26:00,4508,"A bit south of you but the Burnt River follows HWY 503 for long ways east and west of Gooderham, lots of access points and for the most part pretty tame, slow and meandering.  sorry that's the Irondale, the Burnt starts in my old stomping grounds Loon Lake and they both eventually hook up, and both are fairly tame canoeing rivers ."
724013,notvincent,2012-08-20 21:31:00,25,Thanks Dave do you know what species i could expect
724028,dave524,2012-08-20 21:56:00,4508,Upper Irondale has some brookies and I understand that since I've been frequenting the area Browns have been stocked in the Burnt. Also expect to find smallies and a few walleyes even musky in the warmer stretches.
724038,notvincent,2012-08-20 22:18:00,25,Sounds like a great river I'll have to check it out for sure
