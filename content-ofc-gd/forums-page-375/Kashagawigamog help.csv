721092,chris.brock,2012-08-08 20:46:00,4053,"the better muskie fishing is up in the north end, and into Grass and Head lakes, we cast bucktail spinners around weeds or troll body baits in deeper water"

721150,NAC,2012-08-09 00:39:00,369,I'll be there on the weekend too Darren.  Staying at Kashaga Lodge. I can give you some bass info but all my muskie catches have been incidental. Fish the weedy bays close to deeper water.  You can get hydro maps at the Minden MNR. Good luck and say hi if you see me.  Will be in kayaks.

721188,Toad Hunter,2012-08-09 04:46:00,261,"Only been out a couple times this year, and all I can say is the bass bite is reeeeealy slow. Like bounce a worm off their snouts slow.  Been finding a lot of them in 15-20 ft of water with steady drops, rocky shores with deep weed edges/drops , but none of the ones I got to commit to eating were worth writing home about so take from this info as you wish."
723452,bucktail,2012-08-18 15:20:00,1857,Well we ran into Canning and Little Canning and picked up about 15 largemouth and snallmouth working shallow weedbeds and other sight fishing targets.  Nothing photo worthy with the biggest being about 2.5 pounds.    Thanks for all the help.   D
723456,fishboy,2012-08-18 15:42:00,550, that seems to be the Haliburton theme this year...topwater has been the best for me this year as it seems you need to annoy them into striking
723458,NAC,2012-08-18 16:05:00,369,"Saturday I got around a dozen largies in Grass on saturday with the biggest being 15"".  Went 1 for 3 on muskie in the same spot.  All on frogs over pads. Sunday was about the same on Kash with no muskies but a couple decent smallies in the 17"" range.  Definitely no tourney winners."
723459,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-18 16:10:00,535,"I caught a 31"" musky casting in Kash on monday, lost one trolling and caught a fiesty little musky in Head lake that just hammered my lure with everything it had."
723466,Toad Hunter,2012-08-18 17:05:00,261,ya I tried top water a couple times (was dieing to try my new (at the time) live target mice) - had a few blow ups but with the bite sooo slow I wasn't expecting anything and missed the hook sets. they didn't seem to big then either.
