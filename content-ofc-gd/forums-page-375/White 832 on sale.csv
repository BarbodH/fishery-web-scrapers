I picked up a Saros Reel on sale for $100.00 and a spool of white 832 line. The line is marked down to less than $20.00. In the past I have used white line and had no problems. Usually I start be dying the last six feet black with a Magic Marker. Whether this improves my catch, or not, I'm not sure... Since no braid holds it's colour, we all wind up using very light coloured braid after awhile. Anyway, If you're in the market for new braid, this is a good deal. Garry2R's"
