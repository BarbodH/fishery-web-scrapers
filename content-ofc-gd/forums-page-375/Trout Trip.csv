Now that I've been able to do all the basics of fly fishing and catch fish, It feels to me that you just havn't expierenced fly fishing to the fullest without catching trout and "" matching the hatch"" and such. I'm aware of the steelhead run coming through in september october but looking for something in August as the weather cools down a bit..That being said, over the next month I'm looking to go on a day trip to a trout stream within an hours drive.( I live in york, by Caledonia) If you guys have any suggestions on where a good place to wet a line is it would be greatly appreciated, shoot me a PM if you want. Doesn't matter to me if its brooks browns or bows!"
