723628,limeyangler,2012-08-19 14:59:00,5204,Cool recap Jacques.  How quickly a year goes by....seems like yesterday seeing some of those images again.  Thanks for sharing...  PS......How the $%#@ did you manage to get facebook to upload a video longer than 3 seconds??!!
723717,Leecher,2012-08-19 21:25:00,7832," Thanks Simon!!!  Yeah it certainly goes by fast I managed to get a video on FB simply because I know the owner, a friend of mine   and got me exclusive access to upload what I want  Joke / joke     No no.... just a lot a patience is what was needed to upload this 100Mb vid"
722190,Leecher,2012-08-13 02:10:00,7832,"I know... I know... your going to say... what the hell dude    giving up already   this, the best time for fishing    For me, mid August is a time to get ready for hunting and nothing can get me more pump up     My time along the water's edge has expired for a short time    Not that I really want to, but other things must get done before the fall hunt  So I thought this would be a good opportunity to share my best moments with you all Enjoy!!!

722206,gino,2012-08-13 03:30:00,400,"awesome report Jacque  , now I'm really drooling for some trout. Have great and safe hunting season...."
722267,mirogak,2012-08-13 15:54:00,387,Nice vid report - loved them trouts.  Now you got me pumped for the fall trout.
722271,adolson,2012-08-13 16:09:00,783,"Nice fish. Out of curiosity/ignorance, where are you allowed 4 lines in at once?"
722278,corvette1,2012-08-13 16:33:00,1765,awesome video jacques good hunting
722281,mercman,2012-08-13 16:50:00,7054, Quebec.    Great report Jacques!! Busy busy busy !!!!
722284,Joey,2012-08-13 17:01:00,9122,Excellent video Jaques
722327,adolson,2012-08-13 19:54:00,783," I just looked at the Quebec regs. Very interseting how different it is compared to here (up to 10 ice lines in some zones, brookies are properly classified as char and have a limit of 10 in the zones I checked, spouse/children using your license, etc). Interesting stuff, I had no idea. Quebec is actually closer to me than many of the lakes I frequent (need to drive a few hours to get to a sane zone with no brookie size limit, for example).  Anyhow, didn't mean to derail the thread or anything. Back to the awesome video: I think it has inspired me - this winter I'll be trying for rainbows through the ice more than the twice I tried (unsuccessfully) this past season."
722353,Leecher,2012-08-13 21:07:00,7832," Thanks gino!!!   Thanks letsgofishing!!!  Good luck with your trout hunt this fall   Thanks Doug!!!   Thanks Paul!!!   Thanks Joey!!!    Thanks Dana!!!  Yes, up here in Qu√©bec we are allowed 5 lines during hard water season, some areas down towards Montreal (not all), are allowed 10 but no live bait (minnows) allowed... only frozen ones   Only other bait allowed are leeches & dew worms.  Referring to my video, where I was explaining my setup and was abruptedbly (spelling here  ) interrupted by a strike, -18C was the temp at the time... I was basically cleaning the ice buildup in the holes every minute or so    Most of the trout lakes I fish up here are stocked & accessible... the ones that are not as easily accessible (back lakes deep in the bush) are not and holds some true monsters   Wish I had an ATV and a small tinny to get to them  Rainbows are fun to catch and put up a great fight    especially on a 24"" jigging rod    The ones you see in the vid are my very first ones I caught... was my first attempt at them but not my last     One out of 5 times trying was successful for me so don't dispare and keep trying for them  Good luck on your rainbow quest this winter and thanks again for your kind words!!! Tight lines Jacques"
722355,misfish,2012-08-13 21:13:00,29133,"Oh ,you just wait til my fall,winter,spring, steelhead fishing is done.LOL'   Nice vid bud.  Happy hunting."

722884,danc,2012-08-16 02:44:00,4677,Loved the video Jacques. You and I think alike when it comes to the outdoors.
723083,spincast,2012-08-16 23:36:00,3279,Great Vid Jacques - took me this long to get my old laptop to download the whole thing A great selection of shots. 10 lines!!??? Wow. Awesome place to get some winter fishing in. (still to early to put away the rod though bud  )
723144,Leecher,2012-08-17 02:27:00,7832," Thanks msp!!!   Thanks Manitou!!! My pleasure   Glad you loved it Dan    Thanks!!!   Thanks Rick!!!  Yeah I know, it's a big file (around 100MB   )  It sure is a great place for fishing"

723372,fishnsled,2012-08-18 01:39:00,3520,"Great video Jacques but far too early for a year end report.	It's times like this I'm glad I don't hunt, it would drive me crazy!! Fishing, no hunting....Hunting....no fishing. lol!"
723432,Out4Trout,2012-08-18 13:32:00,98,"Enjoyed the Vid Jacques!! Good fishing for sure. I can relate to the hunt vs fishing dilemma, although I usually make it out for Sept-Oct smallmouth a few times. Once mid October arrives, hunting rules the free time. Then, ice fishing again!! Soon!!"
723501,Leecher,2012-08-18 23:14:00,7832," Thanks Will!!!    Yeah decisions, decisions   Thanks Out4trout!!! Glad you enjoyed it    So true, once hunting is done... Ice is up"
