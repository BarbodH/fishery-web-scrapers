715900,scott_f,2012-07-19 00:05:00,3,I bought a pair of Cocoons from Bass Pro Shops .... but they're over the glasses sunglasses. They really fit well over a pair of eyeglasses and they're polarized too. Pretty good for $50.
715963,206,2012-07-19 04:27:00,563, I too wear eyeglasses and wonder that the best over the glasses type are or is it truly better to splurge on a scripted pair?
716277,scott_f,2012-07-20 01:45:00,3, That I'm not sure ..... Like some of the other guys on here I can't justify spending big money on sunglasses. A scripted pair probably be (or at least should be) better but I thought I'd give these a try. They have different sizes and colours too .... check the website. They're big enough to fit over my glasses but not too big to look dorky! They also seem to block out most of the sunlight from the sides ... and they're pretty comfortable too.
717398,GreenCanada,2012-07-24 04:18:00,375,"What model of Maui Jim's do you guys wear? I see only two styles ""dedicated"" to fishing, but obviously others would work as well.  I'm looking for your input!"

They were $19.99 i think for two pairs. I keep them in the boat for tying or reading charts, then pop the Maui Jim's back on after."
717688,registerfly,2012-07-25 07:45:00,198, If you can wear contacts they have bifocal ones that seem to work where your eye starts to focus on the section of the contact for close up reading.

I sat on em and they still fit and I'm a lard ass  Costco have been selling the same model for several years now. This is my second pair (lost or stolen not broken) Costco's warranty is about the best there is. It's pretty well unconditional    The Amber tint seems to give me the best contrast."

The prescription ones set me back about $300 a pair and worth every penny. Difference is night and day when compared to the fit overs.

715356,grimsbylander,2012-07-17 16:14:00,3016," I agree. I use Flak Jackets with the dark polarized lenses on bright days and switch to H2Optix with amber lenses in low light hours and cloudy days. I'll be buying a pair of Nema glasses next though...just to try cause I've heard good things. Bottom line, don't go cheap with your eyes. People always underestimate the protection and performance you receive from quality lenses. I've had friends borrow my glasses when in my boat and then be surprised at the clarity and polarization."
715357,whiskywizard,2012-07-17 16:15:00,305," I have tested them side-by-side. Maui Jim glasses are worth the extra money. But there's no need to pay full retail. Ebay has some real deals on Maui Jims.  Or go with a local eye care professional. One of the best buys I have had on Maui Jims was my local small-town optometrist. My wife was looking for sunglasses for me as a gift. The local guy matched prices for her  and provided far better service.  Besides, my eyesight is important to me. I place more value on good UV protection."

The difference between a cheap pair of glasses is the standard of the lenses. Any imperfections of the lens and thickness differences will cause your eyes to constantly compensate for this flaw and can cause eye strain. They are also impact resistant to keep a hook from getting to your eyes. I broke the nose clip on mine and called the company I shipped them back and they said the lens coating after 5 years was no longer shedding water correctly so they shipped me a new pair.

A family friend of ours (Steve Arpin), who has been on the verge of driving in NASCAR for the past couple of years, recently announced a sponsorship by Skeleton Optics. So to help Steve out a little, I bought a pair of THESE. Well, I have never been so impressed with a pair of shades in my life, ever. So I bought another pair for my 75 year old Mom. She tried mine on and simply said WOW. Where did you get these? Then I bought a third pair, same style, way different colors  (Check them out) for my gal Nita. She loves them. For fishing, the polarized ones that I wear are amazing. I've never been able to see so much structure under water. For general use, the colors just pop unlike anything I've experienced before. The product itself is made in Italy. The lenses are made by Carl Zeiss, which is a highly regarded German camera glass lens maker. I've had a couple of Zeiss lenses for my cameras and they have been among my best for picture quality. The product is reasonably priced too. Around $100.00 a pair. Hook up to their facebook page and they often have 25 to 40% off sales."

For some of the numbers I have seen here or in stores I would only want to pay if they were prescription lenses. I wonder if some of the buyers of these expensive brands have actually done a side by side field test to compare cheap ones to their pricey twins?  I have a brand new pair of Oakly lenses, never been used. My son wanted the name on the frame when he ordered new prescip. sunglasses but the lenses are of no use to him! He was willing to pay 250 bucks for what I see as a cheap plastic frame to have prescription lenses put in them because that name was inscribed on the temple! VANITY!  I have a cheap pair of Berkleys bought in FLA. a few years ago, 8 bucks and just bought another pair at Wallyworld across the border for 5 bucks out of a sectioned off cardboard box so they were cheaper than the other Berkleys. They are great! The glare on my car's windshield totally disapears and find I can't drive that piece of crap car I have without them in any sort of daylight. As for fishing, they work pretty damn good too. But then some people are not happy unless the name on the label says $$$ s. A can of peas or a green pepper at Fortino's or Lawblaws came from the same warehouse and was shipped on the same truck as the ones at No-Frills but they cost more at the first named stores.
