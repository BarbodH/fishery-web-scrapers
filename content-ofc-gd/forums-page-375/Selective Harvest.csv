723298,Woodsman,2012-08-17 20:48:00,1286,"Where did I ""reference WWII human rights case law"" ? All I stated was ""Cases in point - WW2 war crimes trials where may were found guilting as the orders they followed were illegal"".(Note may should have been many. My spelling mistake.) This I stand completely behind. Did not not say all. War crimes trials were not human rights trials. They were charged and tried for committing crimes against the accepted standards of war. Yes in some cases human rights violations did play a part. In most cases their home countries were signatories to these standards. The point was following orders contrary to the law is not a valid defense which has been held up in legal trials."

723220,adolson,2012-08-17 14:56:00,783,"Well, I used to weigh my fish, but after some... uh, ""education""... from guys on this very forum, I tossed my scales in the trash and now I only measure length, if that.  --  Early this year, when there was still ice to stand on, I had posted on a social networking site that I was ""3/4 of the way to my 2012 fishing goal."" Someone who doesn't fish much (maybe 3-4 times a year) got right pissed at me, claiming I was damaging the fishery and ""imagine if everyone did what you are doing."" Must've been thinking that I caught and kept nearly two thousand fish, before ice out, hahahah... Obviously that wasn't the case at all, with ""2012"" being the year, and my goal of the year being simply to catch one of each of the four trouts available in my area. Still, goes to show that some people are passionate about the fishery, even when they use it only a few times a year themselves.  I would agree with Terry and say that law-changing is the way to fight unethical practices, because in my limited experience and observation, education from fellow anglers more often than not boils down to angry berating and belittling, with very little in the way of trying to convey reason and transfer knowledge. And at the end of the day, that gets you nowhere. Maybe to get a fishing license, you should have to take a course..."

I am always within the posted regs and until they change the laws and make it illegal then i say, people who don't agree with me or others should save thier breath and not try to educate me. Thats not your job and its not something I am asking for. I fish for fun and really don't need to be converted:sarcasm: sorry meant educated.

723226,jimmer,2012-08-17 15:22:00,2730,"Panfish populations can definitely be hurt by over harvesting. I have seen it happen over the years. I'm sure that's why there are limits on panfish in certain areas. There are anglers out there that don't fish within the law and feel that the resource is endless (similar to the cod fishery that was mentioned earlier), but I doubt education will change anything. They will just move to a different lake when their success dwindles. One thing that I learned over my years, is that nothing will ever stay the same. Some of the phrases I have heard over the years: We always limit out when we go walleye fishing in the kawarthas. You'll never fish the crappie or bluegill out of the lake, they're endless. Go perch fishing in Lake Simcoe, you can fill your trunk. If I don't keep it, someone else will. Sad"
723229,Fisherpete,2012-08-17 15:35:00,1814,"Education and common sense certainly needs to be applied here - bottom line is that they should not have been musky fishing without any release tools. If they had been bass or walleye fishing and caught a monster like this by accident, different story, but to intentionally target muskies without having basic release tools is just wrong. Is it required to have a massive Stowmaster net, 16"" long pliers and a pair of Knipex? No. There are more economical and still functional options out there - but to spend $1000 on muskie rods/reels/lures and not have the basics shows a real lack of common sense.  I think if they had pulled a 40"" up on the shore, there would still be anger, but to do it to a 56"" just plucks the anger strings of all us serious muskie anglers who are so passionate about the sport and fishery, and spend so much time and money chasing a fish like that. It's wrong either way, but feels EXTRA wrong in this case because we all want to catch that fish.  As for the original post, I too used to keep quite a few fish, but soon figured out that smaller ones do taste better, and that I enjoyed the sport of catching the big ones year after year. My cottage is on Rice Lake, and over the years I certainly have seen my share of pails getting filled up, but in all honesty things have gotten better in recent years with regards to poaching. I used to see stringers and pails full of largemouth every May and June, but have not in recent years. Maybe it is enforcement, maybe it is better awareness, either way, it seems to have made a difference.  We all need to remember and respect that while some people fish purely for the sport of it, others do so as a source of food - and as long as they fish within the law, we should not judge.  Pete"
723230,ecmilley,2012-08-17 15:42:00,2163,"just like the jehovah's gotta show up and try and make me believe what you believe. I remember the times when a part of fishing was the ability to share and enjoy it if you felt like it, now everyone gets ragged on for keeping a couple bass or walleye or god forbid a musky. I'll keep fish as a feel and don't worry about what the yahoo's think so long as i abide the law. as I recall I have never yet had anyone refuse a plate of fresh walleye yet, pretty sure most of the people offended by catch and keep just can't catch dinner"
723235,Gregoire,2012-08-17 16:09:00,1397,"I will not question an angler who keeps a legal fish. I just worry that this angler in particular will catch much more fish that he legally must release and will end up killing them due to not having the proper release tools.  I believe that if you are fishing for sport and not for food ethically you must make sure that you do everything in your power to make sure that the fish are released with as little harm as possible.  Paul I think you may have jumped the gun a bit in calling this guy out. Now he is probably feeling defensive and will reject all advice that you give him. Maybe he has a pair of plyers in his boat, and water releases smaller fish.  I also think that some muksy anglers, including myself, feel a little jealous that a fish this big was caught by someone else and not released, as it means that I will not get a chance to catch it.  For those of you who feel that musky anglers are pompous know it all zealots who look down on other anglers: there is a bit of truth to that thinking. There is a movement in the community to change this opinion, and to stop the negativity associated with posting pics of musky. I hope that most people who are reading this thread are getting more information than negativity."

If people don't like that, well to bad sucks to be you,  Hope your a good swimmer because if that came up during a harvest of yummy fish, you would be swimming back to shore pretty darn quick. I wonder how many people would stop taking pictures of out of season fish if someone told them to stop. I think zero is the answer. All  aside I have found most people have selective morals and also selective memories that they try to impose on others for the greater good.  I say its time to be true to yourself and let others find thier own moral level. Almost 100% of the conflics in the worlds history are caused by someone thinking they are morally superior. The same goes for fishing. As long as I am within the laws of my area I have the right to excercise those laws to the fullest without having to defend to anyone.  As I said before, if your panties are so much in a knot then lobby to get the rules changed. If the majority wants that done, and they are changed I will be the first one to adopt them with open arms. Until then, I do respect that you do have the right to think how you, do as much as other have the right to think as they do. So whois right ""everyone is"". Thats the beauty of opinions"

In my mind it is similar to the ""I was just taking orders"" defence.  I am not trying to attack you with this post, I am just trying to point out that you can act within the law and still be acting unethically. As a small example, legally I could choose to release a fish by punting it as far as I can into the water, but ethically I would not. On a similar note legally I could go panfishing and keep all the fish and filet them and store them in my freezer, but since I do not eat fish, I would have an ethical problem with doing this.  I am just trying to give you something to think about.   By the way, it is not illegal to cheat on your wife."

I will continue to be true to myself and if I should decide that I might like to change then that too is my choice not others.

723274,Gregoire,2012-08-17 19:30:00,1397," Some people choose to engage in debates and hope to learn from others opinions. Others want to close off discussions.  I also disagree that all opinions are right and valid. For a long time in our society we thought that women were not equal to men, amongst other things. By engaging in discussions about what we think is right or wrong we, as a group, can come to a consensus and hopefully make changes for the good."
723281,Woodsman,2012-08-17 19:48:00,1286,"""I was just taking orders"" defense is only valid if the order is valid. If someone is given an illegal order (ie: to do something against the law) it is their legal obligation to refuse such an order. To follow an illegal order is not defensible. Cases in point - WW2 war crimes trials where may were found guilting as the orders they followed were illegal. If the order is legal than no law is broke so a defense for it is not required. No similarity in these cases. If you think you ""legally I could go panfishing and keep all the fish and filet them and store them in my freezer"" maybe you should check out the regs. Most panfish have catch & possession limits. If you think ""legally I could choose to release a fish by punting it as far as I can into the water"" you better check out the regs again. This could very well constitute allowing edible fish to spoil. Please refrain from giving legal opinions of which you have no clue just in case someone believes you, then they get charged for it."

723291,Gregoire,2012-08-17 20:27:00,1397," When referencing WWII law it is important to realize that many people were found guilty of violating international law specifically human rights laws drawn out in the Geneva convention, not the law of the country that they fought for. In some cases people were found guilty even though they apparently did not violate any laws. This was the case with Adolph Eichmann. If you are interested in that topic specifically Hannah Arendt wrote a great book called ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" on the topic.  Should I point out that you should not reference WWII human rights case law unless you are certain of what you are citing, as you may mislead people?  This is an online forum, I doubt if someone got charged for punting a killing a fish they could use the information they received as a valid legal argument. Just in case, and for the record, it was not my intent, nor did I want to provide a legal opinion about what does or does not constitute the proper release technique of a fish of the catch and possession limits of any type of Ontario sport fish. Sorry for the confusion Woodsman."

723131,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-17 01:45:00,336,"I'd like to throw in my perspective from an American who has been to Ontario at least once per year for over 40 years and mostly to the same lake.  There has been a lot of change in that 40+ years.  I remember that on all of my first trips that we killed a crapload of big fish.  We were allowed 6 fish per species (walleye/pike) and we always tried to limit out usually with a 22"" minimum.  Even the fish we ate were big and we ate a lot of walleye.  Most any big pike we would also harvest.  It was a badge of honor when we got back and bragged about the fantastic fishing in Ontario.  I think that was the prevalent feeling amongst my fellow American anglers at that time. We have pictures from that period in time, that frankly, I'm embarrassed. About the mid to late 80's it seemed like we had to work harder for fish, much harder, and the fish were smaller.  We began an introspection of ourselves.  We always thought that there was so many fish in this lake and by our fishing harvesting habits, we are not seriously affecting the fishery, are we.  In the early 90's, we changed our ways.  We started to kill walleyes 18 and under to take home and eat.  We would talk to other groups that flew into our beloved lake and tell them as nice as we could that this is our collective fishery and we all need to take care of it.  It wasn't long until Ontario was one of the first regions to recognize the benefits of using slot limits and selective harvest techniques to balance the need for taking a few fish for table fare while leaving important breeding stock in the lake to perpetuate the species.  Today, I feel that my group has come full circle.  The only walleye that we keep over 18"" is a walleye that would not live if released.  I also feel that most Americans have come around to this way of thinking.  So, don't blame us, look at the guy with the white bucket."

At that time for them, doesn't matter to me what sizes of fish they are, and it shouldn't for them either as long as they're within the law.  They're having fun, keeping far fewer fish overall than most of the serious anglers I know, and wanting to enjoy eating some fish they caught.

723069,misfish,2012-08-16 22:53:00,29133,"  You mean like,your not laying up on that par 4,that,s reachable with a 3 wood? HAHAHAHA  Back to our OP thread."
723071,Terry,2012-08-16 22:56:00,14456," but it is as you say ""in your eyes"", who are you to think you know better then the next person...that seems like one hell of an arrogance  go after the law and leave the legal fisherman alone, your are not better then them  do understand that there is a law against harassing legally fishing fishermen and that seems to be what you are doing, hope you get charged"
723073,Pikeslayer,2012-08-16 23:01:00,1443, Only if it's a dogleg right Brian
723074,misfish,2012-08-16 23:02:00,29133, Yer rpm is skipping.
723077,DoubleDigits,2012-08-16 23:25:00,140,"If the guy in the video was planning on releasing that fish, then I would understand the criticism, and agree that he is an idiot. If he intended to keep it (legally), then I see no issue (though he very well might still be an idiot). Look at the outcomes: This guy now (hopefully) has a very impressive fish mount on his wall that he gets to show off forever. One man is very happy, and some people that go to his place will be either impressed/amused or grossed out.  His wife will hate it. Also, there is one less big, old, predatory fish (since we aren't talking about legality, then who cares what type...right?) swimming around in that river/lake. That particular fish will never reproduce again.  It is perfectly valid to think that killing a fish for a trophy or food is wrong or unethical...it just always sounds a little suspect coming from fishermen. Especially when accompanied by self-righteous outrage.  Besides, if you're into confrontation and re-education, there are plenty of illegal fishing practices to focus your vigilance on..."
723078,Christopheraaron,2012-08-16 23:31:00,3525," It's called a replica, I really wouldn't be upset by this except that it was a musky..."
723080,Joeytier,2012-08-16 23:35:00,3990,"I am not being arrogant.  I was lucky enough to be raised with not only fishing, but catch and release since I was very young, and since I feel it a vital part of securing the future of fisheries that I plan to fish for years to come.  I consider it a responsibility to let people know how I feel about the issue.  No harassment or vigilance from me, but feel free to report me."
723081,Rich,2012-08-16 23:35:00,3927,I wish we didn't have to impose laws to instill common sense.
723082,DoubleDigits,2012-08-16 23:35:00,140,"Yes, I know."
723084,Terry,2012-08-16 23:36:00,14456," if you want a replica thats fine, some people like the real thing try showing up at a party with a replica girl ..  real girl or blow up girl...well you will find out I am sure"
723090,DoubleDigits,2012-08-16 23:55:00,140," This is a solid point...and again, to each their own."
723091,Woodsman,2012-08-16 23:55:00,1286,Terry I'm in full agreement with you. If someone is acting within the law I don't know why some people feel it's OK to preach their opinion to try to change their habits. I see this just like those who will knock on your door trying to convert you to their religion. Also not on in my book. We as anglers/hunters must support all those who act within the law. If we divide ourselves the antis will surely use this divide and concur. I have no problem discussing different views but trying to converting those to your views when they are acting within the law and have different opinions is over the top.
723092,Rich,2012-08-17 00:00:00,3927,"These are biological facts they're preaching, would be the difference."
723093,GbayGiant,2012-08-17 00:02:00,1780,You guys talk like this happens every day. You can probably count on one hand the number of fish this size that come into anyone's boat in one year. I would say most go back. I would also say that over half die regardless of weather they were let go. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but it gets really sad and pointless when those people try and force others to follow them in their thinking.
723094,mercman,2012-08-17 00:02:00,7054,"  No arguements there my little bearded buddy. I told him that it was legal,but a sad mistake.When asked why he had no net, or tools onboard while fishing Musky, his answer was he spent 1000$ on rods and tackle, and could not afford a net and tools. When asked if he couldnt pay for proper tools, how was he going to pay the 1000+$ to have it mounted, he mean mouthed me and logged off.  Then logged back in and proudly announced he was going back out Musky fishing again tonite.  I see the need for education here"
723095,Rich,2012-08-17 00:05:00,3927,I know places where it certainly happened everyday. Long point bay for example. Doesnt happen anymore though. The fish dont often reach 5 or even 4 pounds anymore.
723096,UglyBug,2012-08-17 00:07:00,148,"As long as they are within the law I say people should mind their own business and move on. This will most likely cause a crap storm but I say if you are really so concerned about this, lobby to get the laws changed. Until then quit poking your nose into others business it might get poked back."
723097,mercman,2012-08-17 00:09:00,7054,  Magnificent memory you have Sinclair !!! I am awed
723098,Rich,2012-08-17 00:09:00,3927,"Lol, alrighty"
723101,Rich,2012-08-17 00:15:00,3927,"Threats for promoting selective harvest, i hate to see what people asking for donations get.  lol"
723102,Muskieman,2012-08-17 00:17:00,2472,"  I've kept Muskies for the smoker , 33"" Walleye , 22"" Smallies and 45"" Pike .... Not to mention the Sheepshead , Silver Bass , Gar , Catfish , Snapping Turtles , Bullfrogs , Clams an Crayfish .... all you can friggin' eat ....  I don't always do it .... but when I do , I do it for a reason ...  To each their own .  Randy "
723103,UglyBug,2012-08-17 00:23:00,148, That's easy they get nothing
723104,Christopheraaron,2012-08-17 00:30:00,3525," I suspected that this would come up, ya I was, but I did think better of that."
723105,mercman,2012-08-17 00:30:00,7054,  Bens Voyons Randy !!!! No mud puppies !!!???
723106,Rich,2012-08-17 00:31:00,3927,"I in true honesty dont even see the harm in mounting a fish. Really, somebody does it once in a lifetime. Put it this way, if 5 pounders are all you catch, keep them and you might get some 6 or 7's next year. If all you catch is 12"" bass and one 5 pounder per year, think about it. Thats one less chance to get a 5+ next year, until all you ever get is 12"" fish."
723010,Rich,2012-08-16 21:00:00,3927,"Is there any way to teach the masses ""selective harvest""?  Keeping the largest perch, crappies or bluegills you catch is the obvious preferred choice, and understandably. These fish are essentially baitfish and would be difficult to eradicate with sportfishing practices. However, i still just dont get the ignorance/stupidity of people dragging home stringers of big bass, pike or other predatory fish. Like, why? Those fish are unhealthy to be consumed as they are old and have soaked up years of pollutants. They dont taste as good, i dont care what anyone says as i tested the theory as a youngster. Largemouth bass in the 12-14"" range are among my favorites to eat. 16"" and up, i wouldn't even wanna smell that cooked driftwood. Night/day taste difference, even fried.  Still, i fish a lotta little lakes and rivers, and see way too many important, large, breeding fiah go home in buckets or stringers. I often try to inform the people of the polluted fish they are keeping, but most go into this old school, defensive ""its my legal right"" rant and just can't be reasoned with. Seriously, the bucket your fish is in is the reason your prize is so damn rare!  Thats my rant of the day. Tried to keep it non-biased and civil. Please do the same."
723013,bobowski,2012-08-16 21:14:00,360,Well said. I think that the problem is due to the fact that most people do not know nor care about what you just spoke about. They don't know how long it takes a 40 inch pike to grow to that size and how much better a fish half its size would taste. I think lack of education about the eco system of fish is the problem in most cases. If they are aware of the way it works then it comes down to just plain ignorance. The way things are going now I wouldn't be surprised if in the next 50 years our fisheries are nearly extinct.
723015,misfish,2012-08-16 21:20:00,29133," Wonder what was said 50+ years ago?  Rich,well said.  I have not kept,or eaten, a fresh water fish in about 9 years. I am enjoying the sport of, FISHING.."
723016,Terry,2012-08-16 21:22:00,14456,"when the perch are full of eggs I throw back the monsters and keep the mid size perch I just can't bring myself to kill that many babies.. and I catch my limit but limit my keep...I never keep more then I can eat, no fish go in my freezer but what others do with in the limits of the law is not for me to comment on....."
723017,davey buoy,2012-08-16 21:22:00,5505," Don't say that,most all of my fishing buddies c&a. The odd one might take one or two home once in a while.On that note seeing that trend,our fish stock should see a rise?. Years ago remembering my grandparents,every time out,lots of fish came home. That was the way than. I like the lower and hopefully even lower limits of fish per person. Who needs 50 perch per person a day as a example?. Slot size,great idea!!"
723020,Rich,2012-08-16 21:30:00,3927,"I think a slot limit seems like a viable solution in most situations, provided it were abided and enforced. It would seem to be the best way of keeping the breeding/large genetic fish in a waterbody. And manage the smaller fish from overpopulation which is actually a main problem on most fisheries. Too many small fish."
723024,misfish,2012-08-16 21:41:00,29133," Are you suggesting slot limits on perch and crappie and blue gills? Rich, that would be hard to  enforce. We don,t have enough resources to make sure this is up held.  These days,the saying,honesty is  the best policy,comes to mind. To much ignorance out there."
723025,bobowski,2012-08-16 21:43:00,360," I should of worded it differently. I mean ""most people that are over harvesting"". Not most people in general."
723030,Rich,2012-08-16 22:03:00,3927,"The baitfish can be harvested and sustained with regular catch limits. I've seen no negative impact of the current limits on the perch or bluegill populations where I fish. Crappies, perhaps, i feel a lower limit would also be best. For predatory fish, genetics are of much higher importance, as much fewer fish, even in prime conditions, make it to the ""trophy"" or even above average size range."
723031,mercman,2012-08-16 22:09:00,7054," I removed this video because i believe there was foul language and/or profanity. My laptop speakers do not work, so very sorry if i offended anyone"
723032,Pikeslayer,2012-08-16 22:13:00,1443,"To each his own.  My nickel,  Slayer  edited to add: made this before seeing Paul's above.  ps. over/under on lockdown is 21. I'll take under for 20"
723033,davey buoy,2012-08-16 22:14:00,5505," What a shame this still goes on!!!,it just ""has"" to get better with the new way of thinking:canadian:"
723035,Christopheraaron,2012-08-16 22:19:00,3525," I watched the first 30 seconds and then decided ""why the heck do I want to see this?"""
723036,misfish,2012-08-16 22:23:00,29133," Here, they were crazy numbers for about 4 years. Now,good luck. Ya I,m going to say it,WHITE BUCKET FISHERS. It,s not only the crappie,AS MANY HERE KNOW."
723037,Terry,2012-08-16 22:24:00,14456,"but if it a legal fish does he not have every right and if it legal who am I to put him down for fishing within the law  in many European countries it is against the law to release a fish, they say it is one thing to kill a fish for food, but to abuse a fish for the fun of catching catching it is cruel and you are charged with animal abuse... so if people are fishing within the law do not try to impose your opinion on them... try to change the law and leave the legal fishermen alone..."
723039,mercman,2012-08-16 22:25:00,7054,"  I confronted him about it, and he said it was his right, to keep it as a trophy The thing probably rotted before he could get it to a taxidermist. I cant see the attitude changeing anytime soon.At least not in our big urban environments."
723044,misfish,2012-08-16 22:33:00,29133,"  There,s a limit to everything. It,s just how far, do we want to carry it? Save for the future,or take all we can get now, and to hell the rest."
723045,timmeh,2012-08-16 22:34:00,609, Sure it is. But we're not supposed to discuss it because it's an awkward and difficult topic. So we're just expected to look away and ignore it.
723046,Terry,2012-08-16 22:36:00,14456,"yeah but as I say go after the law, get them to change it and leave the fishermen alone..if the law is changed to stop someone from killing a 54"" muskie then we can insult anyone killing them, but if caught with in the law it is none of our business what he does with it"
723047,Spiel,2012-08-16 22:39:00,9065,"You can change the laws all you want, but since we (provincially) can't enforce the ones we already have (sadly) I suspect education is the only avenue."
723048,Pikeslayer,2012-08-16 22:41:00,1443, It is his right Paul.
723050,misfish,2012-08-16 22:43:00,29133," We need to get out and fish.  I hear what yer saying.(we have had enough talks about this) LOL With in the law,they break no law.But, let education,not the law, change their ways,thought,of our fishery.  Was typing as you posted Spiel."
723051,Christopheraaron,2012-08-16 22:43:00,3525," Ya it's his right, but that does not mean that we shouldn't be able to confront people who do that and try to re-educate them."
723063,Pikeslayer,2012-08-16 22:51:00,1443," Confront? Re-educate?  The word aggressive comes to my mind. In his, he did nothing wrong and confronting/re-educating him could lead to whole new level of confrontation.  Just sayin."
723066,Joeytier,2012-08-16 22:51:00,3990,"So provincial/national law takes precedent over everything?  I disagree strongly, and believe I have every right to be critical of someone who is my eyes is harming fisheries unnecessarily.  And yes, I understand the very act of fishing is essentially doing no good to our natural ecosystems, but unnecessarily killing trophy fish for meat, is in most cases a simple case of ignorance, so why not attempt to educate them?"
