The post to Selma's Caveat was to show you that this issue isnt just about dogs and to point out to you what you refer to as ""silly"". Police Officers are required by law to have a warrant to enter someones house if unwelcome...""Silly"" in my mind is that an Animal Control Officer doesnt require one and can steal your property (dog) on an allegation of an untrained eye (neighbour/politician/peace officer) just by saying the word mythical ""Pit Bull"" You seen in the video Bryant trying to pick the ""pit bull"" out of the photographs. DO you not think if he is writing a LAW for us Ontarians to abide by..he should at least KNOW what he is writing it about? Now thats ""silly"" and ignorant. Silly is not looking to a sucessful format such as Calgary's.

723992,Twocoda,2012-08-20 20:36:00,4130,"Tragic Suicide After Pet Dog Is Destroyed:    Mark Amston, aged 20 years, committed suicide in 1991 the day after he had his own dog, a pit bull terrier, destroyed, he had failed to get the compulsory insurance.The pit bull terrier ‘Sandy’ had been brought as a six week old puppy in March 1991 before the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 was introduced.  The death of Mark Amston was investigated by Coroner Mr Dewi Pritchard Jones, the inquest heard that dog owner Mark had been worried as he had failed to get the compulsory insurance for his dog under the restrictions introduced in 1991, the coroner Mr Jones said that Mr Amston’s position changed from having a family pet to being the owner of something which in the eyes of the law was dangerous and had to be controlled, Mark Amston had his dog put down and the following day he hanged himself. The Coroner said:   “In this case it was a family pet that had to be put down, not a fierce animal. There was no evidence that this dog was fierce. I think the lesson from this death is that legislation should be based on reason and not on panic.”  Mrs Christine Amston, Mark’s mother said that the dog had been brought as a puppy before the new regulations came into force and that the family had no idea her son had been planning to have the dog put down or, after he had, that he was planning to take his own life.  Mark’s Amston’s seventeen year old sister found him hanging from an attic doorway at the top of the stairs the day after Sandy the dog was destroyed.  Coroner Mr Jones said that the death of Mark Amston, aged 20, from Caernarfon, was “a consequence of legislation rushed out and not properly thought out”.  He also said that it was obvious that the Government had been pushed into an action by a press campaign which had highlighted dog biting incidents, however trivial and “all of a sudden this family pet became a dangerous weapon, you might say, subject to controls and compulsory insurance, as if one were in possession of a lethal weapon”.  Mr Jones said that Mr Amston had left a note and it showed that he was closely attached to the dog and had decided to die with him. The note had simply read:  “Goodbye; me and Sandy will be together for ever.  Me and Sandy will never be parted again.”"

724050,GreenCanada,2012-08-20 22:50:00,375," I don't know why I bother commenting on this thread, other than to prevent users from taking what is presented here as fact.  In 1991, if memory serves me correctly we had a Premier by the name of Bob Rae, leader of the Ontario NDP. (Not McGuinty)  The legislation spoken about in this article (not sure where it originated from, as I found it on some website that anyone could make) is from 1991. http://www.endangereddogs.com/DDA-Suicide.htm  It does not make mention of the same statutes that were passed in 2005 and therefore is not relevant to your discussion of BSL in my opinion.  This young man obviously was not being provided the care, treatment/counselling, or restraint that was required of his situation. He did not die because of the legislation enacted in 1991, he died because he did not know how to continue on without his companion. This is unfortunate, but I would hazard to say a VERY RARE occurrence, unless the person in question maybe was dealing with some serious mental health issues. Did this young man suffer from undiagnosed mental health issues as well? I have no idea.  I am getting sick and tired of reading the bleeding heart stories being posted here and am just about ready to counter each one with an equally devastating story from a victim of a dog attack, whether it be a chocolate lab (my dog breed) or a pit-bull type dog.  Your political diatribe is getting old and I would appreciate you creating an email listserv of willing participants instead of spamming our fishing board with this one sided debate using stories that are designed to pull at heart strings, while not providing unbiased intelligent debate.   So my last comment in this thread, before matching story for story is this.  Create an email list Twocoda, where you can send weekly/daily/hourly updates on your cause and crusade.

A longtime critic of local government now works for the town. The Chester Town Board recently appointed June Maxam, publisher of the website North Country Gazette, to the post of animal control officer. JuneMaxam has used the website to blast the town and Warren County, and their officials, for years. She regularly tosses allegations of nepotism and back-door deals at local officials and fire officials.  But June Maxam’s confrontational past is raising eyebrows in and around Chester Town Hall. Chester Supervisor Fred Monroe hasn’t been immune to Maxam’s poison pen.  “I know I’ve taken a pretty hard line approach and I’ve won a couple rounds,” Maxam said. “Fred and I have had our ups and downs, but we respect each other.” She said Monroe asked her to apply for the job. Some local officials said they expect criticism when news of the appointment spreads.  Maxam recently lobbed allegations of unethical and illegal conduct at local fire officials and the Warren County Sheriff’s Office. June Maxam is currently appealing the ruling in a lawsuit filed earlier this year seeking to force the Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company to release its financial records.  June Maxam served nine months in jail in 2003 on a felony conviction for falsely accusing her neighbors, Donald and Eleanor Lambert, of harassment. The conviction was overturned on appeal and dismissed in 2005. (June Maxam is the publisher of the website North Country Gazette).  Chester officials said she was chosen based on her record with animals, not her past interactions with local governments.The town makes about $4 per license, and it’s that cash Maxam plans on using to fund her outreach and enforcement efforts. Maxam replaces Bill Mosher in the $6,600-a-year post. MORE FROM THIS SOURCE.  The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press March 27, 2003 – June Maxam, who has published the North Country Gazette in Chestertown, New York, since 1981, is serving a nine-month sentence in the Warren County Jail after a state appellate court in January rejected her appeal of felony convictions for falsely accusing her neighbors, Donald and Eleanor Lambert, of harassment.  “The record reveals that defendant has had a long and tortured relationship with the Lamberts, as well as just about every elected official and police agency in her community,” the court wrote in its decision. “Defendant claims that all of these people have demonstrated animus toward her because she has criticized them in a local newspaper that she intermittently publishes.” In July 2000, Maxam was convicted of two counts of filing false harassment charges and sentenced to nine months in jail, according to court documents. MORE FROM THIS SOURCE.  UPDATE Tuesday, November 22, 2011 …Chester NY board reaffirms June Maxam appointment after hearing complaints. CHESTER – The Town Board has decided to stick behind its appointment of June Maxam to the post of animal control officer, as dissent from local residents and officials continues to swell in what may be the most controversial hiring of a dog catcher in recent memory. Supervisor Fred Monroe said he asked the Town Board late last week if it wanted to hold a special board meeting to reconsider its decision to appoint the controversial website publisher to the job  Included in those displeased with the town’s decision to put Maxam on the payroll are Eleanor and Donald Lambert. Maxam accused the Lamberts of harassment in 2003. The charges against the Lamberts were dropped and JUNE Maxam was convicted of filing false accusations, a felony, and served nine months in Warren County Jail.  “I’m livid. If I had a dog, I wouldn’t allow her on my property,” Eleanor Lambert said late last week. “They’re rewarding her for all of the troubles and heartache.” MORE FROM THIS SOURCE.  UPDATE POSTSTAR.COM Thursday, February 23, 2012 9:25 pm. Chester NY parts ways with June Maxam, notorious animal control officer whom supervisor praised has been fired.  CHESTER — June Maxam’s short but controversial tenure as town animal control officer ended Thursday night as the Town Board overrode Supervisor Fred Monroe and sacked her.  Maxam’s employment status has been ambiguous for more than a week. She quit last week in an executive session of the Town Board, only to return the following day to pick up the equipment she turned in the night before and began again responding to animal complaints. Many town officials believed that Maxam’s job ended last week when she stormed out of the board room, but Monroe welcomed her back  On Thursday, the Town Board overruled the longtime supervisor, firing Maxam in a 4-1 vote. Only Monroe voted against removing her from the $6,600-a-year, part-time job. “The Town Board does not desire to continue to employ June Maxam,” read Councilman Mike Packer from the resolution. MORE FROM THIS SOURCE.  Jailed for 9 months and fired as dog catcher, June Maxam appears to be the most hated person in Chester NY, most people dId not want her to even be the dog catcher at $6,600 a year, how low can you go.  Chestertown is a hamlet (unincorporated village) in Warren County, New York, United States, in the Adirondack Mountains, in the Town of Chester.   Bill Warner Private Investigator Sarasota Fl at www.wbipi.com""  Here is an even more interesting synopsis of her recent trials and tribulations.  https://encyclopediadramatica.se/June_Maxam  I would quote the article, but unfortunately there is some choice words I would rather not have associated with me. It is a very telling read though and provides a bit of a contrast to the article posted above that was written by June Maxam. If you care (I don't) feel free to read it.  I am not even going to bother stepping into the debate about dog welfare in this post as it is obvious this topic is not designed for constructive dialogue, but to push ones own point of view."

Pit bulls are still outlaws in Miami-Dade County.  Voters overwhelming opted to keep a 1989 ban on American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers and high-content mixes of both.  “The fight does not end here,’’ said Debi Day, an activist with No Kill Nation. “Plans B, C and D will go into effect immediately. We will not let the ""pit bulls"" and their owners be forever victim to this discriminatory law.’’  Dade residents voted 63.2 percent to 36.8 percent to keep the ban in place.  Among them, Patrick and Sonia Reid, of West Kendall, who consider the dogs “vicious.’’  ""People don't always do what they are supposed to do,’’ said Patrick Reid. “They are supposed to keep them secured.""  But on the flip side, graphic designer and mother Lily Sanchez voted for repeal.  “These dogs shouldn't be discriminated. It's up to the owners and breeders on how they train their dog,"" Sanchez said. ""With a 23-year ban, it's time to stop.""  Repeal advocates waged a passionate grassroots campaign with the help of celebrities like Shorty Rossi, from the reality show “Pit Boss,’’ and Marlins pitcher Mark Buehrle, who settled in Broward after signing with the team because one of his family’s pets, Slater, is an American Staffordshire.  Dahlia Canes, founder of the Miami Coalition Against Breed-Specific Legislation, the group that spearheaded the ban repeal, was disappointed but not surprised.  “We didn’t think it would pass,’’ said Canes. “This was handed to us [by the County Commission] whether we liked it or not and we had to take up the challenge. We only had a few months to reeducate an entire county that has been brainwashed for 23 years.’’  In February, a group of Miami-Dade commissioners short-circuited what appeared to be a winning effort in the state legislature to abolish the ban, calling it an attack on the county’s home rule authority.  Repeal advocates say that pit bulls suffer from unwarranted stereotyping as vicious killers with nearly supernatural powers of destruction, and that thousands live peacefully as family pets all over Miami-Dade despite the ban.  Miami-Dade Animal Services Director Alex Munoz said in a statement that the department “respects the will of the electorate and its decision to not repeal the ‘pit bull’ ban today.  “We want the public to know that while this ban continues, the department will continue to work with rescue organizations and adopters to find new lifelong homes for ‘pit bulls’ outside of Miami-Dade County.’’  Read more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/13/2951979/pit-bulls-remain-illegal-in-miami.html#storylink=cpy#storylink=cpy"

LACED WISDOM: Time to get rid of a bad law  View more by Mike Lacey  Learn more about the upcoming march at http://www.facebook.com/events/146688082136740  Mike Lacey is managing editor of Peterborough This Week and owns a mixed-breed dog that is not a pit bull.  (PETERBOROUGH) You have to give the pit bull crowd credit. You would have thought that now, seven years later, they would have given up on repealing the Province's pit bull ban.  But not a chance.  So next Saturday (Aug. 25), the Peterborough Pit Bull Co-op will be marching to support Bill 16, which, if passed, would end the restrictions on owning the so-called dangerous breed in Ontario. The march takes place at 2 p.m. at Confederation Square.  The ban, unfortunately, came with a few problems. For starters, there is no actual pit bull breed. As such, a list of breeds with pit bull traits are illegal to own, while any dog with that look -- you know, that pit-bull-shaped head and body -- must be destroyed.  It's really just a general word we use for a dog that looks a certain way, a type of dogism or breedism, if you will.  Which is one reason why humane societies and other animal rights groups were against the law at the time.  After all, the law requires government officials to remove young pups from their mothers and kill them. Sadly, yes, that is what occurs if they happen to find ""pit bull"" puppies.  But the other problem with the ban is that pit bulls are not even the most likely dogs to bite. That distinction usually falls to the Golden Retriever or Labrador Retreiver -- no doubt a result of the fact the animal is a popular family pet.  And just because a dog is ""pit bull,"" that does not mean it is going to be an aggressive animal. Aggression is tied to a few factors, key among them being whether the animal, if male, is neutered, and whether the owner treats it with love and positive discipline.  I've known many a pit bull over my time. Some were ruthless and frightening, but others were quite gentle and loving.  The difference? Owners.  An unneutered dog with a bad owner is a dangerous recipe.  I can understand the original intent of the ban, but it's a bad law. After all, before pit bulls there were Dobermans. Before them, German Shepherds. You can toss in mastiffs to the mix of dangerous aggressive dogs.  Unless we're prepared to ban all dogs of a certain size, you can never prevent the damage that a large animal with a bad owner can inflict.

723460,tb4me,2012-08-18 16:31:00,3295,"Wow, I just read this today. Its sad that that's the way it is now. As you know Dave I have a husky. She is a bit of an idiot but wouldn't hurt a human. Now another animal, well its fair game, as far as she is concerned . when we decided to keep her we also decided that she will have to be kept muzzled in public and always on a chain. The only time she runs free is when she swims. I run her daily on my Mountain bike. The point i'm making here is, we know we have a dangerous dog and we take full responsibility and take every precaution possible. Now having said all that there is no way we will ever do this again. Breed specific is exactly how we will look for a new dog later on down the road. None of the above listed dogs for us. Too much work and too much trouble. Good luck on the fight Dave, however i'm afraid your fighting a loosing battle. There are some dogs that you cant control, and i'm afraid the breed specific ones are the trouble makers. Sad but true. Is the law right, I honestly don't think so but tell that to the kids that get bitten and families that loose their beloved family pets that get ruthlessly killed by these dogs. Our Husky will be our last for this very reason.."
723559,Twocoda,2012-08-19 04:49:00,4130,"  This is my cousins Dog Dakota Ron and he lives in Calgary a place that has a 78% decrease in dog incidences since its inception 10 years ago of a scientific based system regarding animals and holding the Owners any dog (of ALL Breeds) responsible and liable for their pets should an incident occur...Last April or May in Calgary there was a little 7 year old girl that was torn apart from 2 Huskies that were set free into the public by an irresponsible owner for whatever reason they couldnt handle the dogs...Who is to blame? Is it the dogs fault they were out in public ruining this little girls life or is it the owners fault for setting them free to cause this incident? More importantly should my cousins dog have to pay with its life for the actions of two irresponsibly owned and handled  Huskies ? If this incident had of happened under a Breed Specific Legislated area ...my cousin's dog would pay with its life and set my cousin as a second class citizen for the unconstitutional violations BSL imposes on EVERY dog owner..Based on BREED (looks) and not Deed (actions) his and YOUR dog would be euthanized.  You are right that owning a dog of a ""dangerous breed"" isnt for everyone and with that comes extra precautions and education which in turn results in a safer environment for the public and your dog.. so that you can enjoy the breed you selected and reap its benefits (its your right) just as it the public's right to have their kids play safely in a park..Killing certain breeds does nothing to solving the problems of dog incidents (Toronto is proof of this) but holding owners liable for the incidences will do wonders for reducing incidences  (Calgary is proof of this) You are a responsible owner of your dog and for that you make the concessions you do (same as me) and i understand the idea of not wanting the EXTRA concessions of owning a certain breed but for me....i cant see myself never having the breeds that i have now..they are just too awesome but im sure as i get older and not so active ill stay with the same breeds but just be more selective in the dogs energy level when the time comes Yours sounds like it might be a high level energy dog where as my cousins is a medium level energy Huskey that is quite content playing ball for a half hour a day and chilling for the rest of the day.  Heres the sad part of the battle...Dalton McGuinty jumped onto the bandwagon of a soundbite in the media (coincidentally a Liberal supporting group) and used ""dogs"" as a smokescreen to ensure the public he was doing something to cover up the fact of his Governments incompetence, All CRIME was high in Toronto in 2005 and instead of dealing with the real issues a boogey man (Pit Bull"")_ was created and 1000s of dogs and good families pets ended up paying for it. SO is the battle worth fighting? I definatley think so as little or as big as my contribution is to the cause...""If you have never angered anyone ....Then you have never stood for ANYTHING"" Winston Churchill...  The architect of Breed Specific Legislation Michael Bryant has killed more people than any ""pitbull"" while driving under the influence of alcohol  You will never get me to agree that either of these dogs deserve to die because of the way they look so i whole heartily disagree with your comment "" the breed specific ones are the trouble makers"" and instead tell you that Dogs are a reflection of what they learn in life and how they are handled  Heres what happens to Dakota when he doesnt get his daily fix of playing ball.  heres what happens to my dog when he doesnt get his fix of playing frisbee    Cheers Ron the river is starting to get active ...let me know if you want to give it a go this fall  http://thetruthaboutbsl.blogspot.ca/?spref=fb&m=1"

I'm not saying that I fully support BSL, but to brand the preposed law as an infringement of our rights is silly. Sometimes the larger population needs to be protected from individuals who raise dogs without proper due diligence, either through neglect or ill intentions, or due to their own naivety. By keeping a pet that has the been bred to maintain attributes best suited for causing physical harm, it is reasonable to assume that that pet has a higher likelihood of harming a human being.  ""Woman attacked by pair of pitbulls in Sundre  Mike Tarasko and Don Cook  Aug 18, 2012 14:29:01 PM  A 26-year-old woman is in a Calgary hospital after being attacked by a pair of pitbulls early Saturday morning.  The victim was staying at a friend's home in Sundre, when the animals became violent.  The woman was bitten on her arms and face.  Adam Loria with EMS says they were called to Sundre around 2:00 a.m. to deal with the incident.  ""We classified her as in critical, life-threatening condition and immediately transported her to the local hospital in Sundre,"" say Loria.  She was then flown to Foothills Hospital by STARS Air Ambulance with possible life-threatening wounds, but has since improved.  There are reports this is not the first time the animals have been hostile.  When officers arrived, they couldn't corral the two aggressive animals and as a result, one of the dogs had to be put down on-site.

723809,Twocoda,2012-08-20 01:57:00,4130,"Here is an article and video interview explaining the ineffectiveness of the Bad Law as it pertains to Dogs...The man in this story is Bill Bruce. One of the key people in Calgarys success of animal control and the reason their statistics of dog incidences have dropped 78 % even though Calgary as a city has grown to over a million people.Since i posted the video of the the ""clown/human and animal killer"" Michael Bryant to this one sided discussion...i thought it would only be fair to bring an EXPERT opinion to this thread regarding BAD LAW as it pertains to YOUR pets Ill post the link to the bottom of this post for those that want to watch the video   Ineffective Laws Ineffective laws set neighbor against neighbor, discriminate against responsible owners, create unsolvable enforcement problems for animal control officers, waste precious public resources, and do not address problematic owner behavior.  Bill Bruce, advisor to NCRC, and Director of Animal and By-Law Services in Calgary, Alberta, discusses ineffective laws in this video interview.   NCRC Interview with Bill Bruce on Ineffective Dog Laws.  Ineffective Laws are: Over and under-inclusive. If a dog owner complies with the standards set forth in his community, how many dogs he/she has, or what kind of dogs he/she has, should not be public business. Ineffective laws penalize responsible dog owners while failing to isolate the problematic ones. For example, in a community that limits owners to three dogs in an effort to control nuisance and other issues, a responsible pet owner with five dogs, who does not create a nuisance or threat to neighbors may face a loss of one or more of his companions. A limit law does not address the irresponsible owners who, however many dogs they have, leave them out at night barking, allow them to damage neighbors' property, or worse, allow them to threaten other animals or people.  Difficult to enforce. How can animal control officers know when responsible pet owners are in violation of a limit law, breed-specific law, a time-limit tethering ordinance, or a mandatory spay/neuter law? They can't -- unless they patrol door-to-door looking for violators, which, in the case of a timed time-limit tethering ordinance means making a second stop after the expiration of the time limit. All this is timely, costly, and just not practical. Breed-specific legislation is especially difficult to enforce because it is impossible, even for animal professionals, to breed label dogs of unknown origin.  Learn more about Breed and Behavior and the inaccuracy of Visual Breed Identification for a more complete understanding of the ineffectiveness of breed-specific legislation.  Costly. Ineffective laws waste precious public resources. Laws that target a breed of dog not only waste currently budgeted resources, but demand additional appropriations. Best Friends Animal Society developed a fiscal impact calculator that allows communities to estimate the cost of attempting to enforce breed-specific legislation. A recent study shows why the expense related to enforcing ineffective breed-specific legislation does not produce the desired result of reducing serious dog bite-related injuries. Click here to read about this study. In addition to the taxpayer expense, ineffective, discriminatory laws are costly to individual dog owners, who may be confronted with the high emotional cost of having their family pet taken from them and destroyed. Or they may bear ordinance-imposed financial costs as a result of a requirement that they maintain higher liability insurance limits, or purchase expensive containment systems. Finally, because ineffective laws lower license compliance, communities also lose licensing revenues that could have been used to fund important animal services.  Alienate pet owners from each other and from the community. Ineffective laws set one group of pet owners against other groups of pet owners. Responsible pet owners who may be over the limit law, who own a breed or breed mix targeted by breed-specific legislation, or who have an intact pet in an area with a mandatory spay-neuter law, will be less likely to license pets and less likely to take pets to the vet for fear of facing stiff fines or worse: having their pets taken from them and destroyed. The resulting impact to communities is a loss of licensing revenue, and an increased threat to public health for animals that do not receive vaccines that prevent the spread of disease in the community.  http://nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/dog-legislation/ineffective-laws/"

My dog can kill your dog look at me I have the toughest dog blah blah blah.My dog got torn up at the dog park by one and when I asked the idiot owner if he wanted to help with the vet bills he asked if I have it on video.What is the appeal of a dog that when it does screw up the results can be devastating? When we talk about the owners being held responsible it is already too late and most of them don't have a pot to piss in anyways. Why are these dogs so popular in the rougher areas of the city? None of the lowlifes ever seem to have a retriever or other non threatening breed. Maybe they need to come up with some sort of IQ test before you can have one. Although if you pass the test you probably wouldn't want one anyway.

723896,GreenCanada,2012-08-20 15:43:00,375," I read the article you linked Dave, but I fail to see the usefulness of it when it comes to providing support for your argument against BSL. The article is written by someone who has a deep hatred for the Liberal Government it seems. I can commend Selma Mulvey for her overall use of sentence structure and grammatical wherewithal, but there is nothing of substance in her opinion piece that sheds new light on any aspect of BSL. What she needs to do is not alienate every single person who doesn't agree with her 100%.  When there is an issue that is so divisive, we must exhibit compromise, and empathy of the other side. This is especially important when your goal of repealing BSL requires the support of the people who voted for BSL in the first place (ie. voters in Ontario).  Being more open to discussion and compromise, not a one sided push of information is the only way this issue gets serious consideration."

Labrador Retriever/Boxer Mix, Neopolitan Mastiff, and Various Mixes of Boxer and Lab with something else....  and now the Minden additions of Rotties/Mix and Mastiffs/Mix  So what does all this mean....it means ....IF you own any of these dogs or anything that ""LOOKS"" like these dogs...YOU fall into the DDLA (Dangerous Dog Liability Act) which means ...no warrant to come into your house and take your dog from you and your family...and makes you a second class citizen because it violates your rights on a constitutional level for at least 7 reasons because ...like it or not....YOUR DOG IS A PIT BULL (which isnt even a BREED of dog)  SO if your Dog ""might possibly"" resemble ANY of these dogs.....Welcome to the ""CLUB""  Do you have a dog in your family now?"
717206,BillM,2012-07-23 19:02:00,17367,"I think some people blinded by love for their dogs are missing some very key points here.  My sister has a AB, biggest pushover you can imagine.  But that doesn't mean a damn thing if one day she decides to take a bite out of someone..  The problem is the amount of damage these dogs can do in a very short period of time.   That's the one common factor with all these dogs, regardless of how well you've think you've trained it..  Not to mention the pain threshold these dogs have, you could take a baseball bat to its head and it wouldn't phase it.  So combine those certain attributes into 120lbs of muscle and you've got the potential for disaster.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what an animal will do is fooling themselves.  These dogs (AB's for example) were bread as working dogs (to catch and hold livestock none the less).  Do I think my sisters AB would ever harm a fly? Honestly, I don't think she ever will.  Is there potential for extreme damage or even death if she does compared to other breeds?  Absolutely."
717309,Twocoda,2012-07-23 23:56:00,4130," your right Bill to an extent....accepting an AB for example also means your accepting the responsibility that comes with ANY large dog socializing the people that come in contact with your dog is just as important as socializing the dog itself....if an owner of a dog senses any signs of unrest in the animal or person...simply crate the dog or put it in a bedroom...just because a certain dog looks like something that dosnt exist...is that reason to euthanize them all out of the province..and strip dog owners of their constitutional rights.maybe the target should be on the puppy mills and bloodsports people..Farming animals applies federal inspections apply it to breeders and punish anyone else.No dog should ever be 100% trusted regardless of its breed or size...punish the deed should an incident happen...not a certain breed that doesnt exist and owners of a breed that ""looks like"" it"

718599,Twocoda,2012-07-29 18:32:00,4130,"Heads up Montreal....This isnt going to bode well for you....heres an excerpt to spark your interest...but please read the whole article  © By June Maxam  MONTREAL, CANADA—Montreal is embracing a new Nazism but its not against Jews, it’s against dogs.  If you live in Montreal and own a dog, you may want to consider moving.  Unless the people of Montreal take immediate action, a new bylaw being proposed by city government would be even more draconian than the current one which resulted in the death of the much beloved Wicca on Thursday.  The Montreal SPCA says a new bylaw planned to be enacted by the city would provide for automatic and mandatory euthanasia in cases where a dog causes a skin laceration regardless of the context or the severity of the injury.  In order words, if your dog scratches a person, the dog would automatically be put down.  Dog owners wishing to fight an euthanasia order from the city will also only have 24 hours to obtain a behavior analysis from their own chosen expert in order to contest the death order, according to the SPCA.  The SPCA says the 24 hour delay will not permit a dog’s owner sufficient time to obtain their own expert evidence as the wait list for dog behavior specialists in the city of Montreal is generally greater than a week.  “What is so scary about what Mayor (Gerald) Tremblay’s office is proposing is that it means that if, for example, a dog was to bite another dog or a person while defending themselves the dog would be automatically sentenced to death by the City” said Alanna Devine, director of Animal Advocacy at the Montreal SPCA, “and it will be impossible for dog owners to even contest this death sentence because the delay of 24 hours is not nearly enough time to find, hire and consult with an expert in canine behavior”.  Montreal residents should attend the next meeting of their borough’s council, call city hall and send emails to voice their adamant opposition to Mayor Gerald Tremblay’s plan for what could result in essentially a mass extermination of dogs in the city.   http://www.northcountrygazette.org/2012/07/28/dog_euthanasia/"
718600,Twocoda,2012-07-29 18:42:00,4130,"What is BSL? Breed-specific legislation is a law that bans or restricts certain breeds or types of dogs based on the belief that those breeds or types are more dangerous than others, when there is no scientifically proven link between breed and aggression. We talk of breed discrimination rather when for instance insurance companies do not provide insurance or landlords allowing dogs refuse to rent an apartment for an owner of a specific breed or type.  What is the Lennox case? Lennox was an American bulldog-Labrador cross that was seized in 2010 and killed two years later by the Belfast City Council Dog Wardens Department after he was deemed a pitbull due to the BSL in place. Lennox never bit or attacked anyone, his owners were responsible and followed the law.  What is the Wicca case? Wicca was an American Staffordshire Terrier that was seized and euthanized by Montreal city officials after an incident where she bit two people. There is no BSL in place where Wicca lived and she is for that reason not a victim of BSL. However, the bylaw in place gives power to a city official to order killing of any dog deemed a danger for public security based on deed and without an expert opinion.  Is there a difference? Although both dogs were killed by city officials empowered by their bylaw, Lennox was killed for his looks – no deed committed, while Wicca’s killing order was based on her deed. The alternative to BSL is to implement bylaws that “punish the deed, not the breed”. In the case of Montreal’s bylaw which is not breed specific, the alternative would be to include consideration of an expert opinion for deeming a dog dangerous, and allow alternatives other than death for dealing with dogs deemed dangerous that could be based on the severity of the injuries caused. Confuse both issues impact your credibility, and that of others defending the cause.  I own a dog, what can I do to keep her safe? Your dog safety is your responsibility: Know and follow the bylaw in place, licence and leash your dog, spay/neuter, pick up after her: Keep your record clean. Provide her with proper socialization, exercise, and veterinary care. Enrol among your service providers an accredited dog trainer: Just like you had to learn to drive, you were not born with the ability to handle a dog that will in the course of her life face issues in learning to behave in a human lead world. Contact your accredited dog trainer if you notice issues with your dog. Most dog bites are easily prevented: Know what ticks your dog and respect it, or work with your accredited dog trainer.  I have a pitbull-looking dog, should I worry? Know and respect the bylaw where you live, and avoid living and bringing your dog in a BSL area, and as with any other dog: see above. Work against the stereotype: Smile and say hello to passersby when you walk your dog, you’ll be amazed how this simple action will ease your life in your neighbourhood. Get involved in your community. Be a good neighbour and an exemplary dog owner. Your deed impacts owners of similar type of dogs.  My dog bit someone, what should I do? A dog bite is a serious matter that is covered in most bylaws, and the result of circumstances that you either did not see or know about, when you should. While a dog bite at home is a private and civil matter, a dog bite in the public space becomes a public security issue and concerns your local government as well. Contact an accredited dog behaviourist right away – and get a lawyer.  What can I do against current laws? Understand the issues at hand. Know your local politicians, organizations and activists and who you should and should not associate with based on their agendas. Educate yourself on canine issues using credible sources, and educate others. Build your arguments on logic and facts, and remember that officials are responsible for public security: arguing that a dog is more important than a human will not be productive and will discredit all others supporting the same cause. Research the facts before you act and base your actions on those facts. Avoid bringing discredit to yourself and the cause you support by acting on and disseminating assumptions, distortions, lies or half-truths. Respect city officials: They are the ones you will need to work with in order to change the bylaws in place, antagonizing them will bring you nowhere."

Phillip tried to get updates from DLCC regarding Ginger's well being to no avail. Even after all these years Phillips voice trembled on the telephone of hurt when he speaks of the incident. Phillip is a large man of over 6 feet but in my eyes he is immeasurable for standing up for whats right and going through all that he has ...for the love of his dog. It has made me wonder...if i could have done it without completely losing it all together. It is planned that we are going to meet in the near future but for simplicity sake...hopefully he will attend from the invitation i sent forth to him to appear on the 27th because it would be an honour to thank him personally  for surviving the tribulations BSL has bestowed upon his life as a Canadian . To think we live in Canada is a mistake....we live in ONTARIO and apparently we do things different here. Its truely a sad situation when it takes a dog named Lennox from another continent to piss people like me off.

I have seen a show where not even Caeser Milan could rehabilitate a dog that was taken away from its litter too young. I know a guy who works for the SPCA in Mississauga and he claims that labs are the most frequent breed to bite.

After asking the owner how often do you walk it, he replied a couple times a month. After I educated him a bit, he had no clue that you should walk a lab atleast once a day, preferably twice for about 30min."

715089,Jer,2012-07-16 22:17:00,1426,"Its a brutal law and I have some personal experience.  Years ago, shortly after the legislation was passed, we were looking after my girlfriend's daughter's dog for a week or two. Paco was ""pitbull"" kinda looking dog, a mutt really. Anyways, one day while I was at work, the younger boys were playing with Paco and our dog, Bear, down in the water. I'd warned them to keep a close eye on him and not let him wander, not because I was worried he was dangerous, but I knew of the legislation and wanted no issues.  Anyways, as 14 year-olds are prone to do, they didn't pay enough attention and Paco ended up out front of the house when the neighbourhood busy-body happened to be walking by. Apparently he jumped up at her (probably looking for a pet) and she went home and called the cops reporting a pit-bull attack. Absolutely no bites or marks besides maybe a paw print on her pants.  Two weeks later, well after Paco had gone home, we got a visit from the OSPCA with ticket book in hand. $2000 in fines (at least 3 different charges all regarding a restricted breed) and a death warrant for the dog, only on the say-so of the neighbour. The OSPCA had never even seen Paco (and never did), nevermind determine if he actually was a pit-bull.  It was a heart-breaking situation, we tried, but had no luck in placing him with a rescue organization and Rachel couldn't bear keeping him under the even stricter restrictions he was placed under in the short term. So a healthy, friendly young dog had to meet his maker well before his time, all because he might have been a pit-bull. To be honest, he probably was but why should that really matter, the poor bugger never hurt a fly.  Here he is all mean looking waiting for a cookie with my dog Bear:     Just as a contrast, Bear who was a much bigger, more powerful animal in all respects, had pretty much free reign throughout our little nieghbourhood for more than 12 years without issue, thank god he didn't look like a pit-bull..."

His life gets turned inside out and upside down for loving the ""wrong"" breed of dog and having an incident happen beyond his control....SO essentially I (and you) AM HUGGING and my American Bulldog is Lennox and so is yours with the growing additions to be added to BSL.. the I AM LENNOX Campaign Around the World is set up to let BSL know....it is going down like the thousands of innocent dogs it has already killed ( Hersheys Law in Ontario)....Its obvious this subject has become near to my heart that it surprises me too that i would ever appeal to OFC and its members to please....
