I stuffed/layered it with, prosciutto and baby spinach.        Fold back together    Wrap with bacon    On the grill it goes    Slice    And serve    Thanks for your post Pikeslayer8  Hope no one was hungry.LOL"

723358,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-18 00:19:00,336," Misfish,  Spectacular     	jaw   dropping    feast.    I think that your bacon weaving looks great and looked perfectly cooked, nice and juicy. 	What kind of awesome sauce did you finish it with?  Could that be added bacon on them taters?    Mmmmmm bacon.     Way to go Brian"
723367,Joey,2012-08-18 01:01:00,9122,"OMG now I'm hungry B, thanks"
723371,fishnsled,2012-08-18 01:26:00,3520,Just finally got around to eating dinner and I could eat again after seeing that. Looks great!
723380,Blue Lk,2012-08-18 01:58:00,337,"After reading the 1rst post about this I had to try. My weaving skills also aren't the best,the veggies were all fresh from the garden & roasted in a pan right under the roast to catch all those bacon/pork drippings. It was a big hit with my GF & the neighbours. "
723402,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-18 03:14:00,336,"Blue LK,  You guys truly honor me!  Looks fantastic.   I think your homegrown veggie tray is a most spectacular idea.    Looks great."
723419,misfish,2012-08-18 10:29:00,29133,"Thanks again all.    Yes it was juicy. I leave most of the cap on the roast as well. The sauce is fried brown mushrooms ,with 1/2&1/2, salt, pepper and worcestershire sauce . Yes more bacon.LOL"
723420,Handlebarz,2012-08-18 10:53:00,3790,WTH I gotta stop reading these food threads at 7am. They both look great

723441,Scott S,2012-08-18 14:06:00,203,That look's awesome Brian. How long does it take on the BBQ? I think I may have to go back to the store. Scooter
723486,Joey,2012-08-18 21:09:00,9122,Ok what did you marinate it in B?
