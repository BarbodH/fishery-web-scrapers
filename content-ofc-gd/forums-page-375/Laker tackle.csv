But i want to set up a really good soft tackle box dedicated to lakers. So the question is, what would you have in your box?  I mean lures, spoons, terminal tackle, line etc. Man im looking forward to this!!!! Thanks in advance!"
723865,jimmy v,2012-08-20 13:48:00,33,"I`ve found that lakers show a preference towards chartreuse/green tones as well as a good silver finished lure,both trolling or jigging,Good Luck!"
723884,gaspumper,2012-08-20 14:57:00,393,"Can't go wrong with any of the Williams spoons,also the canoe spoon."
723886,Broker,2012-08-20 15:07:00,482,"Green,blue,silver,gold any of those colours for little cleos and williams warblers. Vertical jigging on very calm days can produce with soft plastics aswell, the colour white for those are best."
723887,bare foot wader,2012-08-20 15:10:00,1354,"green is visible fairly deep in the water column, which explains why it's such a good colour, here's a graph and a link, soon as I read up on colour absorption I think it explained why black/purple is my fav colour to pull on lake O  1/2 oz jig with a white tube or grub is a must for me, if I can't get them downriggin soon as I mark baitfish or big arch's on the screen i'll pull the riggers up and jig  http://www.educatedangler.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=921 "
723918,adempsey,2012-08-20 16:33:00,1498,"You can use all sorts of spoons, spinners and minnow baits.  I currently use a three-way rig with a MH rod and braided line.  I don't own any leadcore/steel or line counter reel type setups since I don't regularly fish for lakers in the summer.  So I use the three-way setup and it works.    So, if I were putting together a ""kit"", I would definitely have:  Sutton (Savant) Silver Spoons in sizes 44 and 72;   Lucky Strike Half Wave Spoon in Nickel;   Rapala floating/jointed minnows in size F-9/F-11 in black/silver and/or blue/silver; .  I also have some X-Zone Swammers in pearl that are popular, but I haven't had much opportunity to try them much.    and as already mentioned some Williams Wablers and white tubes."
723921,adolson,2012-08-20 16:37:00,783,"I haven't caught lakers on anything other than white tubes (as I said in your other thread) but I also have only targeted them a couple times and didn't really know what I was doing.  That being said, my go-to for other trout is the blue/silver Little Cleo. It landed me my first brook trout of 2011 and many since, including trolling, casting, and jigging through ice. It also caught my first soft-water splake this weekend, so I would say have at least some of those in there. I'm confident they'd catch lakers too, I just haven't tried much yet."
723922,4x4bassin,2012-08-20 16:38:00,1025,"White/Silver or Black Shad bucktails tipped with a 4"" gulp minnow and homemade treble stinger , probably catch a 100 lake trout on this set up each year !"
724109,Stoty,2012-08-21 02:57:00,2910,"If you plan to fish through the ice at all for them, then DEF get some Xzone Swammers in pearl as mentioned above!"
724111,manitoubass2,2012-08-21 03:13:00,11391,"Tanks for all the replies guys, much appreciated!  Now how about rods, line and terminal tackle?"
