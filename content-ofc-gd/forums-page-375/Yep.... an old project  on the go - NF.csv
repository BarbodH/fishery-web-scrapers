Deer Blind Project  Anyhoot, today started staining the panels (6 of them) that was sitting in my shed for the past couple of years    About time I get to it don't you think   and with all my staining jobs I've done in the past, never fails, rain was on the menu late in the afternoon     Well, before it happened, had done 3 panels out of 6 and were dried enough without worrying    so my Mrs and I put 3 of the panels back into the shed and the other 3 are sitting outside in the elements since they are water proof now  Made this little video for your viewing pleasure... will keep you guys updated... Enjoy!
