723470,Raycaster,2012-08-18 17:51:00,528,"Got a great deal on a used boat but alas no trailer...  Lots of ads ""boat & trailer"" where the boat is junk but the trailer is usable. It would be nice to buy a new trailer but the wallet's not in the mood.  Anyways, just wondering on the work and cost of disposing a old fiberglass boat (without motor). I'm handy with a reciprocating saw and not afraid of a little work but don't need a $500 bill at the dump.  Thanks ahead."
723479,Skipper D,2012-08-18 18:44:00,1970,"Most places .. dump sites will take it  if you cut it all up , public costs at thease places are 90.00 per ton or less depending on where you are , you wont have that much if the boats a sixteen footer i would'nt think ."
723489,Uncle Buck,2012-08-18 21:36:00,1000,it cost me $50 for a water logged 16'trihull...  They just grabbed it off the trailer and the guy had a blast crunching it!
723495,John Bacon,2012-08-18 22:02:00,3277,One option would be to cut it all up and then slip a few pieces into your garbage each week. This will require a place to keep it for a while.
723496,cheaptackle,2012-08-18 22:05:00,849,"Listen to the Uncle!  Cost me 25.00 for a 16 footer at an old ""no scales"" county dump AND they let me fill it up first!  Not sure where you are but check with your local landfill/transfer station - if they have scales you're probably less than/around 1/2 ton in most cases.  Michael"

723522,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-19 00:53:00,10439, Make sure you fill it up with barrels of toxic waste before you scuttle 'er cap'n.    :tease:
723526,mike rousseau,2012-08-19 01:16:00,4661,I'd buy the boat/trailer combo...  Then post an add for a free boat...  Then you don't have to worry about low balling...lol
723588,Blue Lk,2012-08-19 13:13:00,337," Exactly what I did,posted add for free boat,6 calls in 1rst 1/2 hr,boat gone in 1 hr."

723626,Twocoda,2012-08-19 14:52:00,4130,its a glass boat...they make for ALOT of black smoke that can be seen for miles...unless you burn it at night with no moon...

723917,Raycaster,2012-08-20 16:25:00,528,"Thanks guys, since its fiberglass wondering if one of those rental portable diamond blade saws would be quicker ""slicing and dicing"" than a reciprocating saw with metal blade?"
723931,zamboniwaterboy,2012-08-20 17:00:00,126,Boat recycling.  This is the most responsible disposal I have heard of.  Can't hurt giving him a call.  http://www.sandycovemarine.com/Page.aspx/pageId/30181/Sandy-Cove-Marine-Recyclers.aspx
724037,Twocoda,2012-08-20 22:15:00,4130, it sure would be quicker...a concrete saw would eat it up in no time or if you have a large angle grinder that would be quicker than a saw zall too... keep in mind to wear your safety equipment...fiberglass can embed right into your skin or eye and the dust from the epoxy and paint isnt very good for your lungs
