722896,Handlebarz,2012-08-16 10:49:00,3790,Dang how did I miss this one until 6:30 am? Wrong time to read this post I think I will be hitting subway got to get some pulled pork to get me through until I can make that.  Did you trim some of the fat off first and just get flavor from the bacon?  Looks awesome
722913,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-16 13:42:00,336," Wow Toad, those look delicious.  I think that may be the the next on the docket.  I'm thinking a 50/50 blend of hamburger and pork sausage stuffed with havarti and jalapenos and finished just like your misses did. Think I'll put em on the smoker for a couple hours. Thanks for the ideas."
722918,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-16 13:50:00,336," Oh no you didn't.  Me, cut off fat, blasphemy.    If I could a, I'd a stapled some more fat on er.  No, the fat cap under the bacon, rubbed with the same rub that you make also, is the most delectable bite there is.   Thanks everybody for all the kind words."
722921,tipupesox,2012-08-16 13:56:00,167,"A local butcher shop in the Buffalo, NY area has a similar item.  They call it a pork explosion.  We had one on a fishing trip last year, yummy."
722922,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-16 13:58:00,336, Pork Explosion lol.  That's what I call it the day after.
722924,Toad Hunter,2012-08-16 14:05:00,261,"I've been hounding her to add bacon bits to the sprinkles (real bacon not that salty dog food like crap) - but she says "" baby, there's already enough bacon"" (pffffft ) I should also add that she puts minced bacon in the meat loaf as well lol"
