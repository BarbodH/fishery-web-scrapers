723871,Raycaster,2012-08-20 14:29:00,528,Need a hitch for a 2003 Windstar and just wondering if better to deal straight with Trailer Hitch Stores or online or maybe Princess Auto? Towing a small 16' pontoon boat.  Thanks ahead of time.
723899,bigbuck,2012-08-20 15:46:00,2449,Best deal I found was U Haul. Installed wired and a bar and ball cheaper by at least 50 bucks.
723900,Luke V.,2012-08-20 15:47:00,286,  I agreed 100%. For a bumper pull hitch they are your best bet. Clean install and they have the proper accesories.
723916,Raycaster,2012-08-20 16:21:00,528,Thanks Guys. Will phone today.  $327 Installed.  Is it worth to install myself and save $75? I'm handy and good with wiring.
723920,Luke V.,2012-08-20 16:36:00,286,Does the mounting harware for the hitch come with? If not you have to purchase it eating up some of your savings. You also have to consider how/where the hitch is mounted on the frame. Some styles use existing fasteners/bolts. Being an 03 some of these bolts could be a bit of a hassel to get out. Not to sure on the windstar how it is mounted though.

My current car I took it to Uhaul, just under 300 bucks and included the draw bar and tax. All depends on if you want to get down on your back in the driveway, 10 years ago I was OK with it, not these days I'm afraid to say.  Hitch World on the mountain is close in price and have a good reputation, they didn't have one to fit my car in stack and the same went for the old van which I had an appointment booked and they said they had one. Went all the way up there (lived in Burlington back then) and they didn't have one in stock but they had confirmed it on the phone that they did.  Crappy tire puts them on sale once in a while but when it came to my car they would have had to order it in and they wouldn't give me the sale price on it, sort of p'd me off! At the time I had more than that to say to them about what my opinion was!"
724059,bow slayer,2012-08-20 23:44:00,1074,"you could do what i did a few years back to save some money on the hitch itself. I went to the local auto wreckers and found one like new on the same type vehicle,they removed it and let me have it for 50 bucks(hitch was about 200 bucks at any retailer)and i got a trailer shop to install it and  wire in the harness for another 50. Total cost was about 130 bucks with new mounting bolts and  wiring harness,i then just bought new draw bar and ball for another 20 bucks (princess auto sale). Everywhere i called they wanted about 300-350 installed plus taxes. I figured i saved about 200 bucks."
