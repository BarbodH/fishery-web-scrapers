So I'm heading up to Haliburton for some musky in about 1/2an hour. If it were you, what techniques would you try if you were the one going out today? I already have the shovel and salt loaded for the ramp and it looks like theres some good wind today. I'm thinking cranks and jigs may be the way to go. Thoughts?"
