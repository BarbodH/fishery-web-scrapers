He finally found the right specialist and now is on new medication, this has helped tremendously.... So maybe now we can get out and enjoy the outdoors do a few  activities we like to do..... Thanx for your prayers, concern it is well appreciated! Plus our computer business is booming, I am so proud of him stepping out on a limb.... He has found his niche in life and is being blessed for his hard efforts.....  Lorissa/DaisyGirl58"
