7645,jjcanoe,2006-12-02 05:50:00,744,I'm sure that some of you have fished here before and hope you'll share some info on fish species caught in the lake.  I'm going to check out a cottage for sale up there next weekend.  Thanks jjcanoe
7663,BabyHerc,2006-12-02 13:21:00,285,"Bass and muskie positively, and I'm fairly certain walleye, and to a lesser extent pike, as well."
7738,LebowSKI,2006-12-02 17:10:00,27,"Moira has a very good fishery.  Pike, L/SM Bass, Walleye, and some giant Muskie.  It's one of the lakes I frequent every year.  That Muskie in my avatar is actually still swimming around in Moira Lake."
7742,mepps,2006-12-02 17:19:00,1301,"I have fished there  a couple times, caught nothing but pike, rockbass and smallmouth.  As listed above, there is definetly musky there."
7890,jjcanoe,2006-12-03 03:53:00,744,"Thanks for the info guys, I wish I was going to bring the boat up but that won't happen this time of year especially if the weather is as wonderful as it has been the last few days.  glad to see that it's a good fishing lake.  Hopefully the cottage we're going to see is worth the trip.  jjcanoe"
