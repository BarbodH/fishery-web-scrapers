7809,Joey,2006-12-02 21:51:00,9122,Not much else to do on a cold windy day so we took advantage of the BPS sale on the two man Clam today ($199).  I think it's a little big for the kitchen tho.  This will be nice in the upcoming hard water season as we usually grin and bear it in the wind and snow.   Our first clam   We got the Little Buddy heater too ($99).         Cheers.  Joey
7814,fishdawg,2006-12-02 22:14:00,912,good deal Joey I bought mine 2 yrs ago & am happy with it - still need the Buddy though
7821,Garyv,2006-12-02 22:54:00,547,I posted about the same unit at the same price ( except in U.S. Funds ) at Gander Mountain about 2 weeks ago.  It was a good deal at that price but better one in Cdn Funds.  If my hut wasn't in the great shape it's in I would have purchased the same thing.
7823,Carp,2006-12-02 22:59:00,1488,Very nice.  An early Christmas present for you ?  Congrats.

7843,Beans,2006-12-03 00:23:00,3339,"Geeeze Joey...I was going to say ""welcome to the club""  I just finished the homemade clam chowder Maribeth made yesterday (it just seemed like a ""soup"" day yesterday with all the crappy weather)  Have fun in your new ice hut !"
7845,Shelley Cooper,2006-12-03 00:31:00,394,"ahhh dang Joey.... does that mean we won't walk out and find Paul in our hut this year??    <jj>  Great looking portable you got. I'm really looking forward to ice fishing this year now... I'll be seeing you out there more with that new shelter...  Pssst... don't forget the ""potty"" bucket and your' all set...    lol"
