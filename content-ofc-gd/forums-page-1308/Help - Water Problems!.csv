7897,outdoorguy61,2006-12-03 04:10:00,220,"Our family purchased a home and soon thereafter had a few leaks appear. Numerous experts came up with an array of expensive options, with a scan of a pipe using some kind of fancy camera producing what has been (10 years later) seemingly the answer..... a root had basically broken a discharge pipe, not allowing adequate drainage. I had it repleaced and we have not had this problem since. The cost was about $1,400 about 9 years ago and took 1-2 days to complete if my memory is correct.  outdoorguy61"

It's great when you offer me help, but I think any of you with kids knows what a wonderful feeling it is when someone helps your kids. Truly what OFC is all about! Do you think he has any chance of claiming any of this through insurance?  He has had to take down a wall and the carpet is also a write-off."
7900,irishfield,2006-12-03 04:32:00,26272,"If he's paid the extra premium for water coverage possibly. Standard policies usually read they don't cover sepage(sp) or repeated sepage. They do cover ""sudden"" floods, but not if it happens to be your above ground pool etc.  One thing to keep in mind with insurance. If he is getting a 10% no claim discount on his policy at the current time he will lose that for 5 years if he claims as much as a 10 speed bike stolen. So add the 5 years of discount on the policy + what ever his deductible is and if the repair isn't going to cost more then don't even think about calling the insurance co. If the repairs are more...call and be very cautious in the asking if he's covered for sepage damage...or they could deny AND remove his no claim discount.  I should add...the only real use for home owners insurance is for the dead beat that falls on your front steps and sues...and if your house catches on fire. Other than that......"
7902,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 04:46:00,3421,"Unfortunately if the leaking did not occure from an act of god ;Flood from an overflowing river, mudslide hurricane etc......insurance companies are not willing to pay.I was fortunate enough to have sued the previous owner in small claims court for $2200 damage and I won .This occured only one week after I moved into my new home .In quebec you can go back as far as ten years on the previous owner if the house leaks alot.It took me 10 months before my case was heard in small claims court.Find out what the laws are in Ontario you may still have time to claim from the previous owner.Best of luck .Mike"

7916,OhioFisherman,2006-12-03 07:11:00,6623,"Roger I just had the front wall of my basement dug up about 3 months ago. I also feel that water problems are best repaired from the outside. Water needs to be able drain, slow or no drainage allows it time to find the weakest link.  My basement is made of concrete block, it had poor drainage on the front because the construction garbage, insulation, pieces of wood, plastic, bottles and cans had been pushed into the hole along the outside wall and topped of by the clay they had dug up when digging the basement. There was also only about 4 inches of stone on top the footer drain pipe. Water doesn`t flow well or at all thru clay, it traps the water against the foundation, all the junk was dug out, by hand(2 men, 2 days) footer drain section was replaced, black flexible perforated pipe was was replaced with rigid perforated pipe,basement wall was resealed, clean out installed and the hole was filled to 1 foot from the surface with number 57 limestone and topped of with topsoil.  The water isn`t coming from inside the house, why try to stop the seepage from the inside? The repair is simple but labor intensive, a 2 foot wide trench dug down to the footer drain, if you can run the water of with tarps or something it is a do it yourself project to save cash if you are physically able to do it."
8035,Pinch,2006-12-03 21:38:00,231,"I dont think that there will me much of a chance to claim through his insurance.  We had some cracks in our foundation that was caused because the builder didnt put any black water proofing on the exterior walls.   This then caused water to seep into the basement and the entire house to shift.  Anyways to cut a long story short we werent covered.  Our policy, which overall is very good, wouldnt cover defects in workmanship or acts of god/nature.  ie flooding."
