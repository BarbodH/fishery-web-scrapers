7753,jediangler,2006-12-02 18:20:00,1923,Here's a link to an interesting musky story out of Wisconsin. I guess it's been awhile since a 50lb'er has been caught in that state. Does anyone do any row trolling for skis up here?  http://www.muskyhunter.com/forums/generalforum/9446.html
7759,Carp,2006-12-02 18:49:00,1488,That big fish must have pulled the small boat like a freight train.  Beauty.
7765,setomonkey,2006-12-02 19:02:00,872,"Wow what a fish.  What a fight it must have given!  Looked at some of the comments on the thread, sounded like this angler is well known locally...  Mike"
7767,Whopper,2006-12-02 19:07:00,2174,What a brute!  Mike I read thru all the replies and your right he was well respected and I was even surprise that no one even commented about keeping the fish.  Got to love the old school though.  Whopper
7773,glirw,2006-12-02 19:23:00,200,"Pull what boat around ? We all know Musky don't fight hard ....  All them big rods are purely for chucking big lures , the fish themselves can be landed by hand over hand techniques  Happy Holidays !"
7777,Handlebarz,2006-12-02 19:34:00,3790,that monseter would be welcome in my boat anyday that thing is a slob congratz to him for that beast
7778,GbayGiant,2006-12-02 19:35:00,1780,"Very nice fish, she only needed to hide for one more day and she would have made the spawn, looks like she was full of skeen already.  The man was in his rights to keep the fish, but why would you ? It was no record, you don't eat the meat, and you can get a replica with exact size anyway, and everyones happy that a 50lbs fish came out of the lake, and look at the respect the fish got.  I'm not trying to stir anything up but why would you keep the fish, it makes no sense to me."

7785,huntervasili,2006-12-02 19:56:00,1604,Like the fact that he had to go to shore cause it wouldnt fit in the boat... with him in it at least
7787,setomonkey,2006-12-02 19:59:00,872,"John,  When it comes down to it, it's up to the individual whether he's going to keep the fish or not, as long as it's within the regs.  I wouldn't keep a fish like that myself, but I can't impose my personal views on somebody else. I could try to persuade somebody I'm fishing with, but it's ultimately up to him/her.  (Just like it's up to the boat owner whether to go with a tiller or console, even though the right answer is TILLER).  Mike  Whopper: I just looked at the thread again, he was definitely respected and nobody brought up the keep issue..."
7842,GbayGiant,2006-12-03 00:21:00,1780,"Setomonkey I love the singnature and agree with what you say, but you know consoles are better  I just read the article again and the fish was full of eggs. You would think if a guy was such a great angler he would understand the benefit of releasing the fish over keeping it for a trophy to boost your ego. He was entitled to do whatever he wanted with the fish but I think he would have got even more respect for releasing it."
7849,fishindevil,2006-12-03 00:39:00,6254,"WOW...   thats a BIG,BIG FISH   a fish of a lifetime for sure"
7896,douG,2006-12-03 04:07:00,2693,"GBGiant is absolutely right.  Perfectly correct.  Well informed.  Correctly focused on the right stuff.  Now stop, already."

7971,glen,2006-12-03 17:36:00,2641,Wow what a nice fish.  Wisconsin has some nice musky.  I wonder what that fish was eating?  It sure has girth.  Some say if you are looking for a musky that fights then fish for the smaller ones.  Do the 30lb + fish put up a big fight or is it different than the small ones?
