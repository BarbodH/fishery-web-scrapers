7913,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 05:58:00,3421,There is a similar product called the shrimp .I saw them as prizes during an ice fishing tournament last February.could not find it on google.

8019,fishindevil,2006-12-03 20:15:00,6254,"its a nice windbreak,but you better make sure you spike it down,before you get up from it or it will make a nice kite,at least its nice and light you might be able to carry it in a backpack,sometimes it makes all the difference in the trip,just to get away from the wind......and the price seems right to"
8049,Rattletrap2,2006-12-03 22:59:00,1652,TheCabelas ad claims that after you sit in the thing for a bit...it sinks the three legs into the ice and anchors itself! I'm just guessing here....but I'm thinking that for some of us....it might sink a little quicker and further into the ice than it will for others?  For some of youz lightweights...a cordless drill with a hole saw could do the trick. Myself.....I ain't too worried about getting those legs set in the ice! LOL

8073,Carp,2006-12-04 00:36:00,1488,"Very smart looking product. Lightweight too.  I'm sure if they bring them here, they'll sell quite a few."
