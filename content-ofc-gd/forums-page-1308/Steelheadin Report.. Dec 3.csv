8154,ccmtcanada,2006-12-04 12:57:00,7971,"Hey!!! I went to Sobey's after seeing this post and they got all pissed off when I threw a line in their Trout display.      Jeez...I showed them the pic posted in this thread and they told me his must have been a division 8 fish and apparently, their fish came from division 6.  To make matters worse, a CO was shopping and I was charged, lost my fishing license and now cant fish or shop in Sobeys for a year.  I'll be trying the A&P across town later today, but I'll bring my 4 year daughter to distract shoppers and employees....I'm wanna catch my first trout by the new year!!!  I know it's bad to ask about locations, but which Sobeys were you fishing at?  PM me if you wish.  "
