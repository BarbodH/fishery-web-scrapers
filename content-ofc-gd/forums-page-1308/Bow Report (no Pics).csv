8173,dgr8t1,2006-12-04 13:50:00,15,Well headed out early in the morning yesterday. It was really cod that i couldnt even cruch up my fingers. Despite the cold still headed out east for some action. In the beginning it was really slow im guessing cause it wasn't still day break. As soon as the sun came up people started hitting them. Out of my luck I didn't even get one hit    but my friends al landed fish between the 2 to 5 pounds and one of them landing 13pound male  . What a fight and a mission to land it. All in all had an amazing time even though i didn't catch any. But its all about getting out and doing what i love the most which is fishing except for the gf. Cheers to all and great fishing and hopefuly ill put up some pics next time.
