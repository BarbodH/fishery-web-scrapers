7289,Headhunter,2006-12-01 14:22:00,5703,I was turned on to Okuma by Gman a few months back... picked up two this fall and have no complaints at all! I really like the big handle and how easy it is to crank in large deep diving cranks. HH
7335,fishnsled,2006-12-01 16:37:00,3520,"I bought 3 this fall and I'm very happy with them.  Thanks to HH, I'm now broke but I'm fully rig for trolling.   Good on Carra Outdoors too!  Great service, nice to know for future purchases."

Gonna run two line counters for wire dipsey rigs and two on the riggers. I hear they're fantastic.  Any idea what Carra's price is on them?"
7780,Burtess,2006-12-02 19:37:00,901,"Didn't Carra Outdoors go out of business??  A while back there was a sign on the door saying it was closed (from a solicitor or something), looked like it went bankrupt.  Or did it reopen???  Burt  Edit:  Number is no longer in service either...."
