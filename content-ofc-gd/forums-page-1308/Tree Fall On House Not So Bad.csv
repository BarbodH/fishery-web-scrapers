7618,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 04:13:00,3421,The freezing rain here near Montreal bent my 30ft birch tree on top of my house.No damage but they are close to some wires.Everything here looks like a glazed Donut.Picks to come Carl is going to post for me.Man I have to figure out the posting thing.Mike
7621,irishfield,2006-12-02 04:18:00,26272,Just don't tell me I need to run a generator to my Mom's like I did in  '98
7625,carll2,2006-12-02 04:32:00,443,      heres  a pic  not far from my house..its funny we only live about 30 minutes away and you got nailed by freezing rain and we got a mix.  
7626,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 04:32:00,3421,No where near 98. I had $7300.00 damage in 98.My 27 foot pool was crushed we were nine days without power. Child number 3 came from the Ice storm.I am currently molding my future fishing partner my 8 year old son .No generator but the wood stove did wonders.Even boiled water so we could have a bath.  Just heard on the news 250 000 customers without power.Mostly on the Island of Montreal.
7628,carll2,2006-12-02 04:36:00,443,apparently its not done yet  the laurentians and lanaudiere and saguenay area can see an excess of 30+ cms from now till tommrow night
7633,Dondorfish,2006-12-02 04:55:00,1000,YUK!!!  - Keep it down there guy's - I thought the flooding around here was bad enough!  Hope everyone is safe and dry.   Don
7634,setomonkey,2006-12-02 05:02:00,872,"Yikes. I remember the ice storm, I had a bunch of friends who were without power for quite a long time.  Mike"
7685,Chris,2006-12-02 14:38:00,405,Here's a few pics from this morning.   This is our tenants car.   This is in front of the (now closed) Nestle' factory.    These branches came off a huge pine tree in our back yard    The sound of chainsaws could be heard in the distance this morning...had flashbacks of the ice storm in '98. Several communities north and west of us are still without power this morning.
7699,ccmtcanada,2006-12-02 15:12:00,7971,Wow...the power of nature is amazing.  Great pictures...thanks!
7708,carll2,2006-12-02 15:32:00,443,well just got my power back lost it during the night.. thank god we have a good old wood stove
7713,nautifish,2006-12-02 15:44:00,1416,Yup we were with out power last night too and this morning. Heard chain saws going most of the night clearing the tree.  I was in Europe when that big freezing storm hit here in 98 but it was all over the news their.  Glad to hear no one was hurt with the tree fall.
7718,tundra,2006-12-02 15:55:00,18,"actually looks like your tenants car got off pretty lucky The 2 types of weather I hate the most are freezing rain/ice, and high winds.  We had both yesterday here in the Barrie area, but got off relativly easy"
7724,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 16:16:00,3421,My birch tree is right back to normal this morning.But I think I will reduce its height.
7727,JEREMY,2006-12-02 16:41:00,300,Well i hope every one is allright even if you are fans of the canadiens.
7840,Lungelarry,2006-12-03 00:14:00,294,"Here's a pic from 1998,it was  taken in Laval. "
7869,IanD,2006-12-03 02:23:00,16,"Power in the West Island (Kirkland) was out from yesterday afternoon (3:30pm) until this morning around 11:30am. no real problem for us since we installed a sealed insert in the fireplace right after '98. Kept the whole house at a balmy 24C all night and day. Was wearing shorts and a Tee shirt Yesterday morning I had 3 poplars on the from lawn. This morning I had only one as two of them were torn out by the roots due to the ice and the wind. Fewer leafs to rake up next fall but more grass to mow this summer, darn. Spent a hour with the chain saw this morning making firewood."
7956,Carp,2006-12-03 16:19:00,1488,Looks like you have some trimming to do Mike.
7959,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 16:41:00,3421,Believe it or not that tree is standing up again perfectly staight.But I will be chopping it to half the size .Snowing heavily right now.My situation was not as bad as others.Those pics of the tree on the car looks really bad.  with all this global warming we are sure to see alot more freezing rain this winter.
