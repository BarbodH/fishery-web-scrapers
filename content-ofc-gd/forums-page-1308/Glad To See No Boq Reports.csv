After seeing the waves down at Lake O last night (No...I didn't try to fish....LOL), all I can say is that I'm glad I haven't read any BOQ reports today for yesterday.  The winds and waves are still crazy there...here's the marine forecast...  Storms west 50 knots diminishing to gales 40 knots early this morning and to 35 near noon. Gales diminishing to wind 30 this afternoon and to 20 near midnight. Isolated wet flurries and snowsqualls. Waves 5 to 7 metres Lowering to 3 to 4 this afternoon and to near 2 this evening. Outlook..Strong westerlies. Seven meters???? 23 foot waves??? CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hope eveyone weathered yesterdays storm....  Cliff"
