7927,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 13:41:00,3421,So who do you think is braving the cold today?Diehards you can't stop them.I hope to see some fish pics later instead of those wacky weather systems.
7938,fishindevil,2006-12-03 14:26:00,6254,"well mike here in oshawa,its sunny and right at 0 degrees,and there is no wind,the kast few days the wind has been real nasty with 15-18ft waves on lake ontario. there might be some guys around fishing the tribs,if they arent to muddy & high...good luck if you get out to wet a line"
7939,lew,2006-12-03 14:28:00,12767,"We'd have been out looking for muskies on St. Clair this weekend if it hadn't been for those darned winds turning the water to the clarity and consistency of mud.  You can dress for the  rain, snow and cold and have an excellent day on the water, but it's tough trolling in those winds and 6  foot waves this time of year  We've still got 12 day till the season shuts down, so we'll see what happens."
7940,Eddyk,2006-12-03 14:36:00,195,"Come on Lew, When we were in the Navy 6 foot waves were a calm day.Are you getting mellow in your old age ?"
7942,lew,2006-12-03 14:46:00,12767,"Your absolutely right Ed, but back in those days our fish'n boat was 400' long"
7944,Carp,2006-12-03 15:02:00,1488,"I have a bunch of things to do, otherwise, I'd be on the water."
7975,setomonkey,2006-12-03 17:46:00,872,"Not me, sadly, my season is done.  Mike"
7992,ccmtcanada,2006-12-03 18:25:00,7971,"Yep...season is over for blyght and I too.  Once you have to knock ice off the rod tip after every cast, that's it for us!!! Stay tuned for a season ending report from us soon!!!!"
8022,SlowPoke,2006-12-03 20:26:00,2984," Hey Lew, The long term forecast is looking good for St. Clair... I'm not putting my gear away just yet!  -Brian"
8068,Rich,2006-12-04 00:21:00,3927,"I was out today for a couple hours. The river looked PRIME for steelhead or browns. Good flow, perfect stain.. but seemingly no fish. Had to leave after a couple of hours to work."
8071,Corey,2006-12-04 00:30:00,355,"I was out today for a few hours... started the trip at Fishmaster's for minnows and worms (damn lively minnows at that). First stop was Welland, at the south niagara(?) rowing club... buncha sunfish, buncha perch, all swimming freely right now. Second stop Port Colborne, docks were all locked up tight, fished from the rocks, few perch, all still swimming. Last stop was in Dunnville at the secret pond... a few teeny weenie crappie's... as usual, back in the drink they went.  It was definately cold, more windy than anything, but not windy enough to warrant suiting up with the survival suit...  cd."
8079,FishFinder,2006-12-04 00:55:00,481,"went out today, well worth it despite the snow and wind  VERY COLD, lol"
8080,PERCHER,2006-12-04 00:59:00,787,The boat is still ready to go.I think next weekend we might give Quinte one more shot.
8098,Mike the Pike,2006-12-04 01:50:00,3421,Hey fishfinder I think you better stay away from that river for now on it looks like there is too much radioactivity in this area.What colour was the dead fish LOL
8099,huntervasili,2006-12-04 01:51:00,1604,LOL any Nuclear Plants nearby there...?
