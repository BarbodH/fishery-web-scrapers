7977,Fang,2006-12-03 17:48:00,1330,With a few weeks between fall and winter I started my list of fishing to do's today.  First up was to fix up my new bucktail box. I picked up an office file folder at Liquidation World for $7. Added 2 plastic cross rails and voila!!  Looks like I have some more room now for baits!    Next on the list is to get the planer board mast ready and fix up my ice fishing sled with a larger wind break.

Like having a cheap box as a kid that dumps in the lake when you pick up by the handle. I know this first hand in both cases!  I let them dry right out before returning to the box...but I found this year it works well and keeps them compact.
