8167,brickNblock,2006-12-04 13:37:00,598,"Hit my Fav. Trib 6:30 this morning. Water was way down from yesterday but still higher then normal. These freezing temps are a big help and prevented to much ground run off which creates most of the muddiness at my trib. Well, no fish to report on, it was still disco;oured and fast moving. Going to get out again this evening and see about some better luck. It was a fresh walk out there this morning I got to tell ya's."
