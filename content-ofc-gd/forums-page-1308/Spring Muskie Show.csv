7612,Whopper,2006-12-02 03:58:00,2174,Matt I went to the one in Columbus this past year and there was a lot of tackle in a small area. I met my first OFC'ers at that show. DrPhil and his son Jason with musky magnets had a booth and I went to one of Pete M's seminars. It was really neat but as far as good deals I really couldn't tell ya with my limited experience. I did get some good deals on some Grim Reapers spinnerbaits. I suspect the Chicago show or the one in Pittsburg is probably better. If ya want to come up to the Columbus one next spring give me a shout I'll probably go again.  Whopper
