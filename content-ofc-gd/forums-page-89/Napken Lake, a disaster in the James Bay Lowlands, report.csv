1006762,Krisco,2017-06-17 14:45:00,67,"Thanks for the great report Chris, looks like you guys had another great trip! I know what you mean about the bugs, we were up at Windermere last week and in 30 odd years I have never seen the black flies that bad! Will be picking at the scabs in my scalp for weeks!  Kris"
1006764,JoshS,2017-06-17 15:05:00,729,Thanks for sharing. Those reports are always enjoyable and inspiring reads. So how big was Dman's brute?

1006851,woodenboater,2017-06-18 23:24:00,2277,awesome TR and great pics !
1006852,Tom S,2017-06-18 23:45:00,362,Beauty report. One of you should pack a fly rod on your next trip. 40+ incher on a fly rod would be wild.
1006855,manitoubass2,2017-06-19 00:33:00,11391,"Great shooting guys!!!!  Bet it was a blast!  I should probably give ya a shout and catch up Brock, it's been awhile!  Looks like all is well though!!!"
1006873,Chuck Enwinde,2017-06-19 09:30:00,247,"The fish I stole off Brad was taped, it was 41"". D Man's fish was in a different league, significantly larger.  CP 24 is running a story on D Man's pike.   The one I tried to steal back was also considerably larger, ooh for one more crack.  I'm not sure the exact size of Adam's fish but I can say it barely fit in the cradle.  Think I've seen that guy on TV before, either way he looks pleased to have met you,"
1006895,BillM,2017-06-19 13:05:00,17367,Awesome Chris!  I know Mike has talked about Napken for quite some time.
1006986,4x4bassin,2017-06-20 14:38:00,1025,"Thanks for sharing the report Chris , looks like good times"
1006995,AKRISONER,2017-06-20 16:56:00,5558,thanks for posting this chris. I got a sense of how bad the bugs were by watching those bloody videos and hearing the terrible mosquito wines that drive me nuts some nights.  Monster fish indeed.
