They were staying at a camp on Lake Wabigoon which is the lake I live on so we managed to meet up a few times. On their last day I scooted from the house and met them near the camp for an hour or so after they texted me they were on some fish. Got there and hooked into 2 beauties....both 28""ers.  Was a real hoot meeting up in the real world, they told me they would be in the camp boat wearing red carnations.....   "
