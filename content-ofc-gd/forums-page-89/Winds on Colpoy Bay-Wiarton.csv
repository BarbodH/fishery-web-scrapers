1006261,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-13 09:53:00,8243,"We have been invited for next week up to Paisley on the Bruce to fish by a buddy from Hamilton that just moved up that way a few months ago. He has been told Colpoy Bay is good right now. He has not had a chance to fish yet this spring. I can't get any info for the bay on any of my wind prediction sites, I use Windfinder and Sailflow. Closest data is Owen Sound. My question if anyone has fished Colpoy is how does the bay react compared to the main south area of Georgian Bay? It sure looks protected from south, west and north winds. A stiff wind from the east would be a problem I would think. He has asked a few guys up there but no help yet. He is after all a stranger. I told him to go to The Legion in Wiarton and buy a round, they may at least give him some ""fishy"" stories.  Ted has fished there but it has been years and can't recall how the winds react. We are taking the 21 foot StarCraft Heritage and all the stuff we use to get deep etc. on Erie.  Thanks in advance all.  Johnny D"
1006271,FloatnFly,2017-06-13 12:05:00,1640,"try this site out, pretty coolhttps://www.windy.com/?44.726,-80.942,11   and yea, the bay is well protected from most directions. i've spent quite a bit of time fishing up there, lot of good places to check out, you can also venture over to lake huron side.  launch the boat in howdenvale, stay inside the islands for some good smallie fishing, pike have also come back into the area as well"
1006272,FloatnFly,2017-06-13 12:09:00,1640,"theses tools on the bottom and side for different forcasts, and for reported winds etc"
1006274,FloatnFly,2017-06-13 12:13:00,1640,"also, make a stop in at Fletcher Sports on hw 6. fantastic fishing shop, and the owner is very helpful.  my dad has run into darryl choronzy a few times in there"
1006277,Rattletrap2,2017-06-13 12:25:00,1652,"What is old Darryl up to these days? Been a long time since I have heard anything from him. He used to be very, very ""Vocal""! lol Good luck on Colpoy Bay. I can't help you and have never been there.....but I would love to see a report (with photos, of course!)."
1006283,icefisher,2017-06-13 12:54:00,5,"The worst winds for Colpoys bay are North winds (NW, NE).  The wind blowing into the bay from the main lake makes it bumpy in a hurry.  Windfinder has Wiarton/Bruce Pennisula wind forecast .     Good Luck"
1006368,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-13 19:33:00,8243,"Wiarton wouldn't come up, now it does.  Thanks guys exactly what I was looking for. Early in the week doesn't look bad. I'm sure the forecast will change 10 times or more in a week."
1006374,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-13 20:56:00,8243,"That's a pretty long highway Floatn. South end isn't far from us where it starts at HWY 24. Where on 6 exactly? Ted and I have a running gag, I get him all hopped up about going to a new tackle shop and then sit in the truck and wait for him because I say I'm not spending a penny on stuff I don't need and can't use right. Then I go in to drag him out 100 bucks latter because he is a tackle addict. He's the addict and I'm the facilitator.  I have it, Owen Sound. The opposite end of 6."
1006380,fishforfun,2017-06-13 22:00:00,105,"OI fletchers is just south of Hepworth, Lorne is a great old guy and one of the best when it comes to reel repairs. Having boated Colpoys for 24 yrs I can honestly say when the marine forecast says wind and waves may vary due to shoreline effect Colpoys bay is a classic example of that. The high bluffs down both sides of the bay act as a funnel for wind from all directions. You'll need to travel nearly 5 miles down the bay to find salmon depths. the north shore is the most productive."
1006382,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-13 22:27:00,8243,"Thanks so much F4F. I can see how the winds might get silly in that bay. I was up to a place my cousins bought years ago, if I remember it was at least 100 feet down to the water. Like a Scandinavian fiord.  I actually have more than 1 good level wind that needs attention. Reel repairmen are few and far between, especially good ones. I will have to remember to bring them to him. A good excuse to invite myself back up there. Thanks again for the tips too, that's great."

1006387,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 00:17:00,8243,"I guess buddy got into town today and asked around about Colpoy's Bay, or is it Colpoy? From what he remembers they were referring to Magnuson's Mansion. Does that mean anything to anyone. He isn't PC friendly and called to ask me to Google it. Nothing came up. He thought all you have to do is Google anything and the answer magically appear. Someone once gave him a laptop. He called me to ask if when I was in the city could I stop by. I went over and asked him what's up? He said ""show me how to use this thing"". He thought I could teach him in an hour or so, bless his soul."
1006392,FloatnFly,2017-06-14 00:50:00,1640,could he referring to mcneills mansion?
1006435,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 16:51:00,8243,Probably.
1006439,Mike Pike,2017-06-14 18:53:00,1332,"Hey Old Ironmaker, if you guys are around Paisley and the winds are up, the Saugeen River is a great backup if you're equipped to wade the river or into canoeing.  Just an option to consider, if you'd be into it.  Bass, pike, trout, it's all there."
1006445,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 19:19:00,8243,"Thanks Mike. 10 or so knee operations ago that would be the plan, not anymore. Wading into the Hot Tub is an adventure now."
1006453,CRUD150,2017-06-14 19:50:00,87,"Easterly winds are the worst for Colpoys. Mornings and evenings can be surprisingly better than the Georgian marine forecast. It can whip up fast mid day, but can lay down a lot quicker than the open lake. With the bluffs, the north to south side conditions can be a night and day difference sometimes as well.  My boat is on Huron. My fishing buddy is on Colpoys. We are on one boat or the other on the water almost every weekend, on one side or the other depending on wind/conditons.  I would not say Colpoys has been good fishing this year, bar a short early stint."
1006472,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-14 21:48:00,8243,"Thanks Crud. I left a post on your thread too. I am heading there Sunday with the boat wind or no wind. I am going to feel like a dolt if I don't and conditions change. What do you fish for there CRUD 150 if I may ask, not looking for spots or tips. I have never wet a lure in Huron or Georgian Bay in 30 years."

1006547,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-15 14:34:00,8243,Thanks very much CRUD. I am going through my boxes today and find those colours. I know I have them. My go to for Lake Erie and Lake O salmon and bows is the bright orange J-9 Rappala. I am going to try some spoons used exclusively on the west side of Long Point on Erie. Monkey Puke is a good one as well as Pink Panties and the Greasy Chicken.

The changing water conditions and forage are at least bringing back native species along our shore of Huron. Walleye are coming along north from Sarnia and we are getting more in the Bayfield- Goderich  waters. Starting to spend more time learning to target them. Just not  quite the same thrill as getting a good screaming 20 lb king on the line."

Went up to Paisley yesterday afternoon regardless of winds and came back early this AM due to a personal matter with my fishing partner that came along. Next time I might even get to Colpoy Bay. Whataya gonna do?"
