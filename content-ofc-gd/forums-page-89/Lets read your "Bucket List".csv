1005861,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-09 17:38:00,8243,"Just read the thread from 2014 by New Hips about his NWT Pike trip to Taltson Bay. Wow, added that place to my very long ""Bucket List"". I did cross one off this year as last month I had the opportunity to be invited as a guest and Golf the Blue Monster at Doral in Miami, another Trump course. Long isn't the word for it. A few of my need to do's before I kick that bucket.  Take my wife to Europe, she has never been, and go to all the places I wish I could have had her there with me.  Surprise a Japanese friend I met on business there 25 years ago. I haven't seen his family or him in 17 years. We just hit it off from the first moment we talked.  Go to Cuba and fish the inland fresh water lakes for 10 pound Largemouth, and catch 1.  Golf Augusta, where the Masters is held. Even if I win the lotto it is highly unlikely unless I befriend a member or become pals with the Governor of Georgia, if they would let him in. I only know 1 person that played there and he was a guest of a famous Hall of Fame NFL player.  Go to the NWT and catch 100 big Pike a day like New Hips and his son did. And get on the water with Dave at his new place as I'm already there.  Fish Lake of the Woods and I might as well drive M2B2 nuts for a few days while I'm in his neighbourhood anyway.  There is one that is X rated I can't and won't share here.  That's about it. Of course I would want to do all this and share it with my beloved, maybe except the X rated one. I have never been one to sky dive, swim with the sharks, bungee jump and all that kind of thing. I always said, ""I get paid to get excited I never pay to get excited."""

On the Atlantic side during May, through a couple different resorts, two anglers in a boat could potentially hook into a 100 tarpon over a week. 5. Panama or Guatemala. Roosterfish. 6. Anywhere for Taimen. 7. Anywhere in Nunavut for char or lakers. 8. Thinglevir in Iceland for big browns would be cool too.  Three fish to catch... Atlantic salmon, tarpon and roosterfish.

1005915,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-10 02:49:00,8243,A great list. I would love to fish the Frazer and hook one of those Dinosaurs as well. I did the Van to San Diego highway 1 runs with my close friend I still see today when we were 19. Bought a 65 Chevy Bell Air in Vancouver for 500 bucks and got all the way to San Diego back to my uncles in Roseville Ca. near Sacramento before it died. Borrowed the money from him to fly back. I think we still owe my father the coin come to think of it.  It was New Hips that wrote the original report. Credit where credit is due.

The only continent I have never been to is Antarctica, and I'm good with that. Not all glamorous. 3 weeks in Oulu Finland 45 KMs from the Artic circle in November/December, stupid cold, ridiculous frozen to the soul cold. A month in Iran to a Blast Furnace operation in June, average temps 35 C, in the shade, no AC control rooms, not even lunch rooms let alone AC, you eat on the Cast House floor. Always accompanied by a Government ""guide"" the entire time. No cold beer, not even warm beer unless you want to pay 200 US for 12 and risk 10 years in a Iranian prison. I can wait. As soon as we left the airport and cleared alcohol banned Arab countries air space the flight attendant was pouring copious amounts of booze. I never had a better beer in my life than that one, and it was Budweiser.  Mr. Bunker, I can't believe you have a list, especially of fishing destinations. I would love to see a list of places you have already fished. That would be any fisherman bucket list, actually enough magnificent destinations for a long list of fisherman.  And Wayne, I always love your philosophies when it comes to life and living.  Ketchinany, you have never been to Niagara Falls and you live in Little Italy (Woodbridge)? You aren't alone. I had pals in Hamilton in their 30's that had never been as well. I had relatives in Abruzzi that were in their 50's then that had never been to Rome then."
