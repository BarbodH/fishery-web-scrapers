Maybe better brand has better quality?  Does anyone have any experience with these?  Any good brands out there anyone have experience with and can recommend?  Thanks in advance!"

Used it with a Sony CD walkman and a 512 Mb mp3 player LOL. My present 2006 Jeep  has your problem, I just burn stuff on CD, old skool."

Thanks Dave. that is what I have been doing until now but tired of cds skipping and wearing down too fast. I have been buying cds to burn from dollarama.  Not sure if there are cheap quality cds and better quality ones that are more resistant to scratching and wear."

Gonna be sweet streaming from my ipod out on the deck.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/pioneer-mvh-291bt-1d-car-stereo-0350325p.html#srp"
1006860,Bass Tard,2017-06-19 03:11:00,128,"I've been using that stupid tape thing in my 04 4Runner.  It kinda sucks, but not nearly as much as my fm transmitter did.  Now, I do think the FM transmitter could work better if you were somewhere up north where there isn't a lot of radio stations.  Around here, there's a signal on almost every number that's as strong, or stronger than your tiny transmitter, so there's always a lot of interference.  My suggestion even though it isn't much help, is keep an eye on Kijiji, in the past month I've picked up one for my truck for $65, and one for my wife's car (brand new) for $80.  Install is pretty straight forward."
