As I heading to my fly fish area, I am seeing large water ponds in the fields. Hmmmmmmmmmm. Get to said river and HOLY MOLLY. How much rain did we get? Hell,even the local snapper wanted out.    So since that was a no go,I headed up to Collingwood. That maybe I would float around in the harbour. It was all muddy. How much rain did we get?  Took a couple of crappy pics of the locals.    White crane ? Watched him picking off his breaky. Might of been frogs,as I heard lots of them crocking.     Coming home, I went through a down pour where I had to pull off. Wipers on high and still couldnt see right.  So,how much rain did you get ?  "

1006825,Terry,2017-06-18 16:35:00,14456,we did get a lot of rain so the ugly duckling  eats frogs i thought  they were vegetarians

1006893,BillM,2017-06-19 13:02:00,17367,"Brian, you should have seen the Coldwater yesterday, lol talk about flood stage."
1006899,misfish,2017-06-19 14:30:00,29133,"And to think, heading that way had crossed my mind. Hit a back lake over there, but the rains changed my mind."
1006900,GBW,2017-06-19 14:37:00,8460,"Rained so bad here yesterday my basement flooded in around a closed window.  I went down to the basement cause I heard a noise and was like ""what is that?"" to then see water gushing in at the base on the window...  I have a $2,000 deductible but covered otherwise if I need to go that route..."
