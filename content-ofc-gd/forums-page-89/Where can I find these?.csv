1006844,buick14,2017-06-18 20:19:00,741,Finding good discontinued baits usually ends up being pricy ..I .always hold out for hopes of finding a tackle shop with a bargain bin of discontinued gems ..
1006845,manitoubass2,2017-06-18 20:29:00,11391,"A local shop here Has tonnes, shoot me a pm if ya want me to grab some. There not too pricey either, I think around $6 a bag"
1006846,GBW,2017-06-18 20:36:00,8460,I have access to molds and can pick colours but when that's the case BULK orders are my only choice sadly.
1006913,jimmer,2017-06-19 17:48:00,2730,Will those baits sink?
1006914,AKRISONER,2017-06-19 18:09:00,5558,yamamoto also makes something very very similar as well. In all sizes right down to a 1.5 incher...killed crappies on em with the drop shot
1006915,manitoubass2,2017-06-19 18:23:00,11391,"On a jig yeah, but the bait itself floats"
1006924,misfish,2017-06-19 20:12:00,29133,"Will those baits sink?   The ones I posted I will use those large single hooks. Thats it. They will sink slightly, but thats the idea. I jerk and pause them. Cant wait to hit a new water hole. From all my reports received, it could be a real fish work out."
1006926,manitoubass2,2017-06-19 20:28:00,11391,What do you mean by single hook?  I fish em on a widegap hook Texas rigged and it's a wicked mid summer bait
1006928,misfish,2017-06-19 20:49:00,29133,"The hooks in the picture I posted. They are 4"" long. The baits are 8 "" long."
1006929,manitoubass2,2017-06-19 21:03:00,11391," I use the 5""ers. Fun bait to fish!"
1006993,jimmer,2017-06-20 16:30:00,2730,"I use the zoom brand because they sink with only a single wide gap hook.  I find the yamamoto are way to soft and get torn apart in heavy cover.  The 3 X stand up great, but not good for me if they don't sink.  Adding a weigh is not an option in heavy cover. So many different baits to choose from. LOL"
1007025,huzzsaba,2017-06-20 19:58:00,884,"A local shop here Has tonnes, shoot me a pm if ya want me to grab some. There not too pricey either, I think around $6 a bag  is this shop anywhere near hwy 17?  Thought I could pick some up when I am headed to the west in a few weeks."
1007041,manitoubass2,2017-06-20 23:02:00,11391, It's in fort frances  Where you heading?
1007058,206,2017-06-21 01:27:00,563,"I had some of these, most ""melted"" when they came into contact with other plastics"
1007121,huzzsaba,2017-06-21 20:06:00,884,"I forget what it's called, I'll look into it. It's kinda a ATV store/bassproshops retailer.  It's in fort frances  Where you heading? tor-edm.  but I see fort france is too far south. May have to buy them online.  I like the fact that they float.  Thanks though"
1007124,manitoubass2,2017-06-21 20:27:00,11391," I can meet ya there, only a 2 hour drive for me"
1007131,huzzsaba,2017-06-21 22:11:00,884,"If ya pass through kenora let me know if ya wanna do lunch or a quick fish!  I can meet ya there, only a 2 hour drive for me Sure will let you know!  thanks!"
1007161,jjcanoe,2017-06-22 11:00:00,744,"Been on the road without WiFi for a bit lol, thanks for all the replies. Not looking for something similar, I've got tackle bags full of similar, I was looking for exactly the same. Wide gap hooks with a bit of lead on the shank will run these a bit under the surface, rigged seedless, you can put them through thick pads or weeds or a no weight hook you can fish it as a top water."
1007164,Chrispy,2017-06-22 12:26:00,168,Give Bill a call at Wally's Bait in Windsor....I thought I seen packages of them when I was there last month.....he lives around Strathroy area so if he has them maybe you can meet up with him around London....  Chrispy!
