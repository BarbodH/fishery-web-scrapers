1007318,GBW,2017-06-24 17:14:00,8460,Hey All.  So last year the bilge pump went and disconnected it in the fall.  Got a new battery in the spring and since de-fogged the motor.  Today my dad went to test the boat and there is something drawing power still.  The boat wouldn't even turn over.  Any ideas?  Even went so far to pull the fuse from the HummingBird (532 I think as I'm not there at the moment but I will be this evening).  What else can be drawing power still when everything is off?  Thanks!!  G
1007320,chris.brock,2017-06-24 17:50:00,4053,Obvious things like lights or the radio.  Are the connections tight on the battery? Is there a volt meter on the dash?  edit- What engine is on that boat?
1007341,GBW,2017-06-24 23:19:00,8460,just got here now and going to check.  the Bat is fully charged now
1007342,GBW,2017-06-24 23:37:00,8460,so thinking the starter has died.  you can hear it spin but not engage to fire the motor
1007348,Fisherman,2017-06-25 02:03:00,7201,Could be a dirty bendix that won't allow the starter teeth gear to engage the flywheel.
1007361,GBW,2017-06-25 15:15:00,8460,got it sorted.  one loose connection.  now to see if it's still drawing power with everything off.  at least it's out of the garage and in the lake on the boat lift.
