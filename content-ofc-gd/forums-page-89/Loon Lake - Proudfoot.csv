1006793,PickerelHunter,2017-06-17 22:53:00,100,Hey guys...heading to a cottage on Loon Lake in Proudfoot township (North or Kearney/East of Burk's Falls) for a few days.  I'll have a couple mornings to head out on the canoe to jig for some lakers and whitefish.   Found everything online that I can on the lake but not much out there.  It's connected by a narrows to a Grass Lake.  Has anyone ever fished either of these lakes?
