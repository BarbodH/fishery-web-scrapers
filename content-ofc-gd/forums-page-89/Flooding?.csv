1007396,leaf4,2017-06-25 20:31:00,2466,  Here's the parking lot at York lol... 2+ feet of water above where you'd typically park I'd estimate
1007397,manitoubass2,2017-06-25 20:42:00,11391,Wow! Unreal!  And here comes more rain!
1007409,GBW,2017-06-25 22:47:00,8460,I just had a 4 hour trip from Burnt River to Lindsay to Whitby (then to SAIL to spend a GC and an hour with my son) and then back to Lindsay.  In that time it rained between 70 to 80% of my travels.
1007414,Tom S,2017-06-26 00:15:00,362,"Went through Caledonia & York this evening. Grand has dropped a good bit already.  Feel bad for the farmers who have crops on the floodplains that are now covered. I guess we'll see how bad the damage is depending on how long things take to dry out. One field just north of York had some fresh round bales sitting in the water, wrecked now.  In the big scheme of things it's probably not a bad thing for the river to get flushed out, it's been a few years since we've had a really big flood and it's really clearing out the banks. Bad timing though, after planting is finished and things are sprouting."

1002209,Sinker,2017-05-03 13:16:00,8692,I just heard on the radio to expect the kawarthas to rise a lot over the weekend to relieve some of the watersheds in the hali/bancroft area.  S.

1002574,buckhorn250,2017-05-08 10:29:00,85,I was up on Upper Buckhorn on Saturday. Water level is way up. I have a ramp on my dock that usually slopes down 3 or 4 inches...currently slopping up at least 10. Water level is way up an close to a record high for this time of year. I also saw a couple of dock sections floating out in the middle of the lake...really hard to see so be careful out there.
1002580,Beans,2017-05-08 11:55:00,3339,A friends neighbor on Big Bald Lake is sandbagging his shoreline...
1002583,John Bacon,2017-05-08 12:48:00,3277,"I heard 3/4 of the parking lot at The Rouge Park is covered in water.  Yeah, there was a lot of water that last couple of times that I was there.  Edit: I saw a post on FaceBook today.  The road way from the bottom of the hill all the way to the parking lots is flooded."
1002584,John Bacon,2017-05-08 12:52:00,3277,"One reason I've heard is that they're not releasing as much water downstream on the St.Lawrence so it's backing up into Lake O. I tend to believe this as this was not an unusual year for snowpack and rain. not enough to bring the lake up this much. From what I have heard, they are also experiencing high water levels down stream on the St. Lawrance.  So, releasing more water out of Lake Ontario will cause floods further down stream."
1002590,leaf4,2017-05-08 13:45:00,2466,"The grand is way up too. Driving along river road yesterday in Caledonia the water was coming up into the parking lot in some spots, and from the bridge you can see the islands aren't visible it's just tree trunks sticking out of the water lol"
1002591,jimmer,2017-05-08 13:52:00,2730,"I'm on Pigeon Lake and it looks like it's going to be the same as the last few years.  I had to secure the wood on my dock so it won't float away.  My dock and boat look like they are an island by themselves.  State of emergency in Minden from what I hear.  I'll tell you, I'm glad my home is far enough away from the shoreline that the high water won't affect my home, but there are many that are going to get flooded out."
1002597,Tom S,2017-05-08 14:10:00,362,"The grand is way up too. Driving along river road yesterday in Caledonia the water was coming up into the parking lot in some spots, and from the bridge you can see the islands aren't visible it's just tree trunks sticking out of the water lol  We've still got a good bit of capacity before anyone on the Grand really needs to start worrying. It's just cleared the top of the banks, plenty of floodplain to fill up before it starts flooding the trailer parks (they're always first to go). I've seen it much worse before."
1002602,Raf,2017-05-08 14:52:00,3495,"ya, up here on the upper grand levels peaked sunday and have begun dropping.  should be fine for everyone downstream unless they release a ton of water out of shand dam.. which i doubt cause belwood was silly low all winter."

It was high in the 80's when I moved here but never completely under like this morning. On the bright side you can now launch at the free municipal launch there , no dock but OK if you have a small tinny or a PWC, it's been high and dry for years since they put it in back then."

1002655,turtle,2017-05-08 23:31:00,274,Last weekend at cottage north Haliburton had to boat in & walk out as access road washed out -actually about 10 days ago.  Heard handing out sand bags at local community centre on the radio.  Water where I am is up maybe 2 feet over high water mark. Hwy 118 between West Guilford & Carnarvon water was close to the road.  I didn't go into Minden but would assume Gull River is up and over its banks.  Lake was between 4-5C and trout catching slow.  I drove the boat and 2 friends caught 3 and lost 1 in 3 rainy then snowy trips.  Should be good shortly but could be a buggier spring due to standing water.

No ice thaw to effect levels if ice actually does just rain. I always wondered how much water the people in control of he Falls on both sides to control levels throughout the Great Lakes. There have been years here, usually in the Fall, where we wake to see almost 2 feet of wet green rocks above yesterdays waterline. There is a strong lunar tide that effects Erie but not sure how strong to drop water up to 2 feet overnight. That's a lot of water that went somewhere."

There is a strong lunar tide that effects Erie but not sure how strong to drop water up to 2 feet overnight. That's a lot of water that went somewhere.  I'm not convinced that there is any measurable lunar effects on the levels in the Great Lakes but Lake Erie is very prone to 'Surges & Seiches' (aka the bathtub effect) which can have dramatic effects on water levels even days after a storm.   At times, larger ships leaving the Detroit River have to adjust their schedules to time the 'high tide' at the West end as the lake settles after a storm.   You can read about it here:  http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/earth-science/surges-and-seiches-2/"
1002183,Raf,2017-05-02 21:48:00,3495,Check your sump pumps for sure.  Ground is already saturated with more to come
1002184,SirCranksalot,2017-05-02 22:01:00,3291,"There are on-line gauges that you can use to check the daily variation of levels at a given location. I check the Collingwood buoy because the run of salmon and trout up the Notty is affected by the water level, which can vary by a couple of feet. A strong sustained N-W wind, which we often get in the fall, can produce these peak water levels. I'm not aware of any seiche effect here.  If you check on-line you can also see that Lake Huron is at it's highest level in about 20 years. Lake O prob is too."

1002186,Old Ironmaker,2017-05-02 22:34:00,8243,Thanks G. Mech. A good read. Anyone that boats in Erie or any large lake should read that. When I see dark skies over NY and Ohio we hightail it back to port in sunny skies. Often by the time we hit shore we are in following 2 meter waves. Not fun in a 19 footer. I cring when I see boats much smaller than mine 10 miles out. I want to see 3 day forecasts before I pick my day.

1002192,SirCranksalot,2017-05-03 00:09:00,3291,The upper Notty has risen about 1.4 m and quadrupled the flow since yesterday. The lower river reacts much more slowly.
