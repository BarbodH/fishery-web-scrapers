I have a few but find myself itching for more. Kinda like when i was 10 and collected baseball cards lol...  It's probably very true that the good old believers, jakes, and other off the shelf standards catch the majority of big fish when compared to the $100+ customs... I'd think.  There are some really nice custom lures out there though. Once you get over the hump of buying one or two, it gets easier. I understand why some hand made custom lures are priced the way they are, but the collectors buying the used stuff is a different story."

1006495,Musky Plug,2017-06-15 00:59:00,398,"Yup muskie lures will empty your pockets. For muskie my max would be about $50 on a trolling bait (a big one), $35 for a topwater, $30 for a bucktail. And those would have to be built to amazing quality for me to drop that cash on them. There are plenty of great quality muskie baits (jakes, believers, big mama's, suicks, tackle industries dominatrix, northmen outdoors cabbage cutters, to name a few) that are under the amount that I'm willing to spend. Those Trofik 5 baits are amazing but I fell over once I heard the price.Thankfully we fish wish such heavy braid that you don't often lose a lure, but it sure does happen still. For bass I don't think I've ever spent more than $15, those Live Target lures right around there are a bit pricey but they sure work and take a beating.   Even with heavy braid rocks still slice it like a hot knife through butta. Almost lost a BWB like that on Gbay, thank god they float lol"

Even the music is at break neck speeds. It is amazing what you can find off piers and spots people cast into. Never use bare hands to pick up lures from the bottom of the drink.

The most expensive single lure would be the Live Target jointed perch I paid 20 bucks for. I don't know if it's any good because there is no way I am going to chance on loosing it so it never leaves my place. I probably have a grand worth of stuff that has never been wet.

Add another $4-$6 for jig heads to go with them. Terry and I split on a lot of spinner baits. All top end baits. There were 40 of them. Cost, well we,ll keep that to ourselves. We got a super deal. 1/3 the price new. Just like the full lot of jig/tube hardware we got. Buying in bulk pays off.  Body baits? I do have some jerks that get close to the $20.  Did I pay full price? Not a chance. I search a lot of classifieds and find them at 1/2 price or less. The tackle swaps are a huge $ savings. I got no problem dropping a few bucks on baits that look cheap, but work great. Up grade the hooks is  all I do.  When you can get a couple of guys to buy a lot of stuff, you save big time.  Our local tackle guy find lots of stuff. He will pass on the saving to his customers. Example.  5 -1/2 & 1/2 hammered spoons last year, for $20. That,s 1/3 price, if I had bought them all at reg. price.  Deals are out there. Search for them."
