You need to be a stubborn dude to this godforsaken disease. 4 1/2 yrs ago, I was diagnosed with a rare form of Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 4b. Had I not started treatment, I would have been lucky to last another month or so. Chemo was no fun but I perservered. My Dr and my oncology nurses (who are the unsung heroes btw) were amazed at how I dealt with it. Do not let your mind take you to bad places. Read, watch tv, movies, listen to music, watch youtube, do anything to occupy your mind. Find out what exactly are the treatment options, if there is more than one, ask why your Dr chose the one they plan to give you. Educate yourself on the disease you have. ASK QUESTIONS!! Lots of them and do not give up!!"

At this time I want to thank the technicians, support workers, nurses , doctors right down to the volunteers who are all very valuable to our health care.  I have had excellent care from all of the people mentioned above.  The whole group is always on time with a reasonable wait time, are truly caring professional people.  Our OFC group is a truly remarkable great bunch of folks.  Your comments & replies have really helped me get through all of this.  I have taken the time to read each response with care & compassion.  I believe I have the last of many medical tests tomorrow.  According to my schedule from the hospital it's radiation tomorrow, install the PICC line on Monday, then start the chemo on Tuesday.  It will be chemo infusion 3 days per week for the next 3 weeks.  After that treatment I don't really know what is next on the agenda.  I'll keep you informed as I move forward.  Once again thanx for all your input.  Even if you just viewed my post & didn't post a reply I know you're at least thinking of me.  Thanx Brian"

996547,wormdunker,2017-03-09 02:47:00,1711,"Than for all of your replies!  They are much appreciated!  It took me a while to get back on the ofc board due mainly to weakness, also a 3 day stay a the the Cancer clinic did slow me down a bit.  I finished my first 3 doses of chemo last Thursday after I was admitted due to getting a CADD pain medicine pump.  The pump has been very valuable in controlling pain, as you probably already know priority #1 is getting out of pain &  feeling comfortable.  An MRI last week revealed The cancer is not in my spine.  That was a major relief!  My procedure is 3 days of chemo, then off 3 weeks until the next round is due.  Then repeat this cycle.  So right now I'm home resting.  I have a health care nurse who visits once per day, to monitor my medication, a physio therapist is also assisting me at home, along with a health care company who has arranged a hospital bed in my home, shower seat, grab rails in the bathroom & numerous phone numbers of which health care provider to contact if I should run into difficulties.  My team of professionals have been absolutely amazing!  My wife looks after me as well as the household.  The technicians, nurses, psws, home care workers & doctors are the best I've ever encountered.  Their work is absolutely amazing!!  My family members & friends have all been here for a visit.  Their kind words & prayers are always welcome.  I know you guys are also a big help in assisting me in getting over this speed bump in life.  Good luck to very one as we will slowly be moving into the soft water season & tucking away the ice cleats & ice augers."

994928,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-20 22:05:00,8243,Good Rick. I know you know your stuff when it comes to healing. If I was in Brians shoes I would be seeing an Oncologist in T.O. to manage the treatments. Not saying that a St. Catherines Dr. isn't good but I want the best and a dear friend is Bone Cancer free for 14 years now because her husband insisted on the best. She had the same bone Cancer as Terry Fox and went to Mt. Sinai in TO and has Terry Fox's Dr. to get the best treatment management available in the country. He saved her life she strongly believes to this day.  You reading this Bri? At least get a second opinion for a game plan from the Jaravinski Cancer Clinic in Hamilton.  What do you call someone that came in dead last in their class at Medical School?  Doctor.  I would want the best available to look at the plan of attack to kick this thing to the curb.
994939,GBW,2017-02-20 22:56:00,8460,"Even though we have yet to meet Brian I feel like I know you (and many others here).  Some days I have positive stores to share and others not so much.  Today I'm at a loss as to what to say here...  My (now ex) Father-in-law has been going through treatment for cancer (not bone like you) and yes he is beating it!  I have FULL FAITH YOU CAN TOO just based on your attitude alone!  Stay strong fine sir! Geoff PS, as for the medical MJ I will pm a friend who's using it for her pain while she's being treated.  If she let's me know I'll pm you but I cannot tell you what each type of 'strand' is best for what when it comes to that stuff."

PMs to assist me in the use of weed is definitely an area where I need help - never smoke a joint in my life till last Tuesday.  3 puffs, then I  waited about 6 minutes & I felt better.

I'm already planning a trip up your way perhaps for the month of June.  I'm planning ahead, but guess what?  It's gonna happen!! Float n fly - Awesome story about your wife's boss beating this dreaded disease! Wooden boater - Guess what?  I will be part of the campfire stories next June! Big Guy - I WILL BEAT THIS BUMP IN LIFE!  4 in 10 million, incredible odds.  Losing your sense of smell & taste are minor detail as you are still on the right side of the sod!! Ironmaker - Yup I know I have to get the right strain for the right name of cancer.  I'm sure I'll be getting the proper name in the next day or so.  By the way that was a 30"", 9 lber!  I hooked it, reeled it in - You were the witness! LOL!  Thanx for reaching out to our community to get advice on the use of weed.  I never smoked but have recently toked a couple.  3 Puffs then put it out.  I'm fortunate that I have a neighbor who has helped me out!! Awesome!  Please tell me more about the treatment at Mt. Sinai There has been a tremendous response here which is great!  I'm definitely going to follow up on them.  PMs about the use of weed is more than welcome.

I've spent too many friggin hours sitting with both of them! Why I asked Brian yesterday what his diagnosis actually was.  Unfortunately I'm gone come Thursday am for 10 days.. but if Brian has an answer before I go away I'll give him direct email contact for the Oncologist that took Martin Blackstein's spot and is much further ahead in research. Wish he'd been on board when Jen started into her treatment for Ewing's Sarcoma.. Osteos brother!  If it is Osteo... I can personally put Brian in touch with both of these Doctors..  "
994965,wormdunker,2017-02-21 02:07:00,1711,"Thanx Wayne this news is awesome!  Question - How do I start St. Catharines treatment such as Chemo & radiation, then up & leave to attend treatment at another facility.  I'm not saying this is going to occur, just analysing options at this point."
994966,NAW,2017-02-21 02:08:00,4022,"This news saddens me deeply Brian.  But your a tough dude.  Only met you once, but you radiate strength.   And you obviously have the moral support from a pile of people!! And that never hurts.  Pm me if you want to chat.  My grandma is 85 and has been surviving bone cancer for 3 years.  She gave away lots of her things years ago thinking she was going to die within the year.  And now you talk to her on the phone and she says she's ""better""!!  She's got many years left, I am sure!  Once she finally broke her old school ""no pain meds"" mentality.   For the first 6 months she hardly even took a Tylenol.  The pain nearly killed her.  We finally convinced her to put on a patch.  And that combined with treatment, she started to feel better in a hurry!!  I'm not worried about you man.  Your stronger than this disease. Keep your chin up!"
994967,irishfield,2017-02-21 02:27:00,26272,"Brian, everyone means well and despite that you're going to be overwhelmed with ""great advise"" You yourself need to put it all through the crap filter and decipher what you need to hear and what you want to hear.  You are going to hear that you need to change your diet.. stop eating red meat.... no sugar.. eat this fruit and that fruit (which of course negates that ""no sugar"" nonsense). None of that nonsense will change anything at this point in time.  DO NOT sit down and Google your symptoms, it WILL NOT make you feel better and it won't cure you. Trust me fully on that...  As for the pros and cons of cannabis oil, like many things it will work for some and not for others. One of my bestest fishing pals cured himself on this route, from what was otherwise a ""get your things in order"" diagnosis. He's still going some 5 years later, healthy and enjoying life again. The same thing would have never worked for Jennifer with her Ewing's and the way it spread in the blood stream.  As for how to switch.... see what they tell you in St Catherines. Get on their protocol regardless and proceed from there as you gain information. If it is Osteo Sacroma.. let me know ASAP and I'll try to help you connect the dots."

994971,manitoubass2,2017-02-21 10:15:00,11391,"Many strains are effective, but we need to divide marijuana into 2 categories.  1.CDC will help apoptosis(death) of the cancer cells and help regrow bone cells. This is typically an ingestible oil given via softgel or tincture.  2.pain relief, this is where you want a quality indica strain. Many of these exist and you'll have zero issues finding a quality indica. This will require a little research. I sent you a link to what strains are more effective for each symptom/ailment or disease.  This is all to be discussed with your Dr. Because 1, your also on a potent medication for pain, so this is going to create variables. 2, you need to show him your doing proper research and are willing to battle said disease.  Trust me, your attitude is crucial. Not only for your own well being, but also for your treatment.  Question everything and document it(I know you have your book). If you don't understand, stand your ground as ask him for layman's terms and an example.  Physicians and even specialists can be horrible or awesome, I haven't figured out the science between determining why this is? One Dr is great for Joe, but horrible for marry. And some just suck, some are just awesome. One thing that helps is your attitude! So keep optimistic (I know you will) ask tons of questions, but do it politely. Want bad care? Question a drs knowledge, sure fire way. Most, not all, have quite the ego.  Look at the studies I sent you about immunocal(undenatured whey protein isolate). In my experience treating terminal cancers, this supplement is 3/3 in recovery, worth looking at. And unless you have kidney failure, it's certainly isn't going to hurt.  Chemo and radiation. These methods have come along way from ""let's basically kill him and hope his cells recover"". Is it going to suck? Yes. But probably not so much for you IMO. Before this you were very healthy and muscular, good mindset etc. You'll get naseated for sure, but that's part of what the marijuana is for. You'll lose your appetite, but that's what the marijuana is for.  Whomever stated avoiding meat and sugar isn't going to help you now, don't listen to that. One gunshot wound is better than 3. Keep off the crap(smokes and booze too)  That's all I have for now bud. Call as soon as your up to it.  And YES! I will fish sunset country with you in 2017."

995006,sleepjigging,2017-02-21 15:24:00,207,"Hi Brian, my sympathies. I would like to add one other view to the many great replies you have received.  There was a man on Simcoe named Shane. They called him Sly. He was out every winter on his Wilcraft on very thin ice, fishing. CTV would show him out there by himself on thin ice. Thing was, Sly could not talk anymore due to throat cancer. He was the most wonderful guy out there. He would help everybody. He knew his time was limited. He was followed by crowds of people on the lake to the place called Slyville (current location of Sly and his entourage on top of the laker and whities).  One year after I found out about him, Sly passed. I think he had a good choice with his time, like in the movie ""Bucketlist"". I have just witnessed 2 family members deal with cancer, through chemo/radiation. The treatments were horrendous. And the end still came. Life was prolonged, but it was a terrible existence for the patient and family.  We are uncertain when the end will come. We regret the things we did not do.  I agree with everyone's well wishes and the spirit to fight the cancer. I would just like to mention that you have a choice in treatments, and it is ok to to choose to use your time to complete your bucketlist instead of spending the time you have left on slow death through chemo/radiation.  Sleepjigging"

995070,wormdunker,2017-02-21 23:04:00,1711,"Thanx once again for the encouragement!  I had 2 more appointments to & 1 was with the radiologist.  What a wonderful woman!  The cancer name is Neuroendocrine.  It is not bone cancer, but rather a cancer that started elsewhere & spread to my bones.  They have yet to determine it's origin but don't forget there are still test results coming in, & also a brain  & chest scan to be completed on Thursday.  Tomorrow the radiologist is going to do a scan to prepare for for my first radiation treatment on Friday which will be followed by a consultation with my oncologist.  By the way my radiologist is also an oncologist. Yes I do remember Sly & Slyville.  What a wonderful man!  His legacy will live forever on Simcoe. At this time I am very tired after a full day at the hospital, but before I leave - it's chin up,positive attitude, welcome all the advice I am able to! Also I do like   F Cancer   has a nice ring to it! F Cancer"
995071,Rattletrap2,2017-02-21 23:12:00,1652,"Wormdunker, We have never met, but this news sickens me! It seems like it is all i hear these days. So many people are being stricken with this disease. I am with you on this fight and wish you all the best. I look forward to you beating this thing in the very near future! Regards, another ""Brian"""
994846,wormdunker,2017-02-20 02:45:00,1711,"Well guys, sad as it is I regrettably have to inform you I have been diagnosed with cancer last Thursday.  I have had numerous tests performed by the wonderful staff at the Walker Cancer clinic in St. Catharines including blood work several times, Ultra sound on various parts of my body, 3 different CT Scans, Bone scan, & MRI.  All of this info has been collected & submitted to my Oncologist.  She delivered the results last Thursday in the presence of my myself, wife, daughter & niece.  This week I'll be attending classes at the clinic to orient me on the procedure I'll be facing as I prepare to undergo kemo therapy & radiation.  Right now the team of doctors have me on medication to relieve pain, deal with constipation & also steroids to help ease the pain of bone cancer.  Until such time I play things day by day.  Last August I weighed 216 lbs, 7 months later I now weigh 172.  Lost 42 lbs, but I'm not overly concerned as this can also be contributed to a complete change of diet, more exercise, no desserts, no pop, no fried or deep fried foods & no alcohol consumption.  Early December I was walking 1 km every morning & up to 2 km every afternoon.  It was right near Christmas I was experiencing pain in my back, shoulders & kidney area.  It was December 15 I had extremely sharp pain in my back & the appointments began.  I'll be starting kemo Tuesday February 28 & I'm going to fight this dreaded disease - I'M NOT GIVING UP!!  At this time I would ask our community if they have info that may assist me.  PM if you wish.  I have recently heard of a case where a patient with bone cancer was treated at a clinic in Vancouver whereby they use medication to rebuild bones.  If you wish to share a similar story, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  Thanx Brian"
994849,manitoubass2,2017-02-20 02:57:00,11391,"I'm here anytime brother.  I gotta admit I lost sleep over the news. But I know you'll kick butt and things will be good man!  I'm already tried getting in touch with my uncle, but he's gone to the trapper shack will Tuesday or Wednesday. I'll talk to him about it ASAP.  Jenn I and the kids are ALWAYS here. Anything you need.  Hugs my man"
994850,irishfield,2017-02-20 02:58:00,26272,Sorry to hear this Brian ! What exactly have they diagnosed you with.. osteosarcoma or something else?
994853,wormdunker,2017-02-20 03:38:00,1711,Thanx for the support Manitou.  Thanx Wayne also for your thoughts.  I knew you would get involved because of what you recently went through with your daughter.  I don't know the name of it at this point.  I have a scheduled MRI this Thursday on my brain (I warned them it might take a while to find it though)!! & shoulders.  Tuesday I meet with the radiologist who will be performing the radiology treatment.  Friday I meet once again with the oncologist & I'll be asking questions about the type of cancer.  I'll keep you informed.
994855,MJL,2017-02-20 04:15:00,2427,"My heart sinks a little every time I see someone else diagnosed with cancer. It is never an easy journey. I went through it a few times from 2010 to 2013 and have been in remission for the past 3yrs (hopefully 4yrs this year). You are part of an amazing community here at OFC that is extremely supportive and caring (I know first hand).  You are already ahead of the game with a positive attitude. As the saying goes, going through cancer is 90% mental and 10% physical. Take it one day at a time.  If you need any chemo tips and tricks, feel free to shoot me a PM. Feel free to PM me anytime  Mike"
994856,smitty55,2017-02-20 04:24:00,928,"Brian I don't know you, but I can't imagine being faced with news like this. All the power to you in dealing with this challenge. Stay strong and positive above all, and find strength in all the support you will get from all around you. You can prevail.  Cheers man."
994857,Pikeslayer,2017-02-20 04:27:00,1443,"Not sure if it's clinically proven, but myself and many many other survivors know that a positive mind is a major factor in recovery.  You can kick the shyt out of cancer. Believe it."
994858,bigugli,2017-02-20 04:34:00,6138,"So sorry to hear this.  I do hope and pray that it was found ealy enough and you will beat this. We have lost 3 close family members in the past few years to cancers, but my wife, Judy, is now 3 years cancer free."
994860,irishfield,2017-02-20 05:09:00,26272,"Brian, I can't believe they'd be starting chemo or radiation if they don't already have biopsy results and know what it is. They all get treated differently...  Possible in the shock of being told you missed what you have, it wouldn't be the first time and I fully understand how that works.  When you know... let me know... unfortunately I have a full deck of cards when it comes to specialists in the sarcoma field."
994861,manitoubass2,2017-02-20 05:28:00,11391,"This strikes me as odd as well.  I've sent Brian about 500 texts tonight and I know damn well he's documenting everything in his book, that's Brian.  If you visit this before my texts Brian call me."
994864,wormdunker,2017-02-20 06:20:00,1711,"Wow! I'm amazed at the support from our community in such a short time of my original post.   Yes guys my plan is to stay focused, stay as healthy as I can be!!  Wayne, they may already know the name of the cancer but I failed to ask that question.  I'm sure you understand as I have a million other things going through my mind at this time.  I want too stay healthy to watch my grand children grow up.  Our grand daughter is 6 & grandson is 2.  I have lots to live for yet!"

994868,Fish Farmer,2017-02-20 12:15:00,2234,"Wholly crap  Brian, wish you would have give me a buzz buddy. You'd be the last guy I'd figure to get that. You're a tough guy and I'm sure you'll get through this. Dam that is bad news. I still tell my buddys of your fishing adventures. You dam well get better my friend."
994870,fish_fishburn,2017-02-20 12:27:00,1311,Sorry to hear the bad news Brian. Well since you have cancer you should tell your doc you want to get your medical cannabis card. Get on some good Rick Simpson Oil and you will need some flower to smoke to ward off the effects of chemo as well. Something worthwhile to watch on utube Running From The Cure by Rick Simpson.
994877,Beans,2017-02-20 13:57:00,3339,"You have my emphathy Brian...I have been dealing with bladder cancer since July of 2009...6 operations since and a cystoscopy every 3 months...damn tumors keep recurring but it is a relief when my uroligist tells me ""all clear"" after each check-up...I find the cystoscopies are an uncomfortable procedure but they only take 5 minutes and better safe than sorry...  Hope things work out ok for you..."

994885,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 14:28:00,1640,"not the news you'd like to see on here. keep a positive attitude, set goals for yourself, eat cleaner foods, and do a lot of your own research, don't just rely on doctors advice.  my bosses wife was diagnosed with bone cancer, her bones are basically swiss cheese now, but she was told she had 2 years to live.  that was 30 years ago.  she did all of the above and was her own advocate  wishing you good luck with your fight, and hopefully you can knock this thing out"

994913,big guy,2017-02-20 19:39:00,414,"You can beat the son of B, trust me.  Was diagnosed with a very rare form last June, esthesioneuroblastoma, Tumour in my right nasal passage. Only 4 people in 10 million get it. Not a lot of data on it, not much experience treating it. Went through 5 weeks of radiation in July and August, in which the hit the left side of my neck, as I had a suspiciously shaped lymph node as well. Then surgery in October to remove the tumour, various pieces inside the nasal area and the bone between my nasal area and the brain. They then rebuilt the bone with muscle tissue taken from my right thigh. Lost 54 pounds through it all, they took my smell organs as that's where the cancer stems from and I lost my sense of taste as well.  Three months later, clean bill of health, no cancer in nose, no cancer in neck, have maintained my weight and feel great, honestly the best I've felt in years.  Cancer can be beaten!!! So get in the there, have a great attitude and kick its ass. You can beat it too."
994914,blaque,2017-02-20 20:06:00,2419,Rough news for sure..........but just think of all the success stories of those that made it thru..........here's hoping for a clean bill of health in your near future !!!
994919,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-20 21:20:00,8243,"Buddy, we have spoken about this and I really appreciate and value the call as well as your friendship you old dick. Like I said get some of that ""Stupid Stick"" to smoke. I told you the story of a friend of a friends terminal Cancer going into remission and he is here 10 years past what the Doc's told him was his best before date. I asked Ted if I can get hold of him to find out exactly but Ted says he hasn't talked to him since he moved out east but will make some calls. I don't know what strain but Ted said it was Sencimilia, senci? Does that sound familiar all? I know there are members here that can steer you in the right direction for some med MJ. All the guys I know that had to go through treatments did better than the guys that didn't smoke. Just today on CHML radio they were talking about med MJ, there are so many ways to take it in besides smoking, liquid, cookies, candies, patches. Get on the stuff Bri. I tried some homegrown for my chronic pain and it didn't help me, but I was told it wasn't the right strain. Now get better so I can show you how to catch a fish and beat the personal best Walter I put you on in my boat. Was it 8.5 lbs or has it gained weight?  Please guys I know there are many here that know the do's and don't for weed. PM Brian and help him go in the right direction. Please."
