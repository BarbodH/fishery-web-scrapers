Buying a house is pretty much out of the question for anyone not already in the market.  Around here people pay a million dollars for a perfectly good bungalow and then bulldoze it and build a McMansion."

The 'country' is easily accessible e.g. going to my favorite fishing spot i.e. 'up North'. Yet we have the all the services of a fair sized town. For us it's the right balance. I understand that prices have jumped here in the last few years, but I don't really know because 'we ain't movin'."

Once the youngest if off to University in 4-5 years country living will be finished. Downsizing and into town... mostly because 6 months of the year or more, Bren and I won't be living anywhere but north for work.  Good luck in the life change, you'll be A-OK!"
1007344,chris.brock,2017-06-24 23:46:00,4053,"Where I live in Oakville near Sheridan College, house prices were going up by $1000 a day this past winter! It was Chinese investors, individuals and companies, buying the houses sight unseen. The foreign buyers tax came in April. People who recently bought houses took a hair cut. I'd be careful making a move right now, wait until things stabilize."
1007345,chris.brock,2017-06-24 23:51:00,4053,I think that would be a smart move if you're ok with the odd hassle and headache. I rented houses to students for 15 years until I had enough of the headaches. It can be lucrative. PM me if you think I could help.
1007007,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-20 18:21:00,8243,"It's been 17 years since we moved out to the country, Lake Erie lakeshore full time. I had never spent more than a week in rural settings. My wife grew up on a small fruit farm in Niagara-on-the-Lake. To me a long commute to work was 15 minutes in traffic. Now it's more than 15 minutes to get the mail. Being closer to 65 than 60 I just can't keep up with all the odd jobs that come with country living, just a fact. At 5AM this morning I heard the shallow well pump banging around and got out of bed and my feet met an inch of freezing water. A compression fitting for the in line heat tracer popped off and the entire water system for this shack filled the bedroom. Hardwood is lifting, all the clothes and stuff in the walk in closet are soaking wet and I had to put the line back together where only 1 person fits and it's a 3 hand job. T.L. had to take the day off work, she was going to anyway as she has the flu to boot. I figure there may be thousands of $$'s worth of flooring, millwork, clothes and furniture be ruined. I hate compression fittings, it could happen again, tomorrow if it happened today. I think I am going to smear it in JB Weld, hydraulic cement and a pound of 2 part Epoxy, yes I'm embellishing but I can't leave it like that.  The insurance guy is on his way out.  We are Tapping Out. Time to get back to civilization. The lake and countryside will still be here, that's what Sunday drives are for. I know we will miss it but not enough not to move. Besides that downsizing in price not size will allow my wife to retire early. She isn't going to miss the 1 hour or more commute 1 way in the winter. Just too much at my age stressing over her drive, doesn't bother her though, country girls are a tough breed they are.]. I can't imagine going to the sink and open the tap and water comes out, each and every time. If we move at least a 2 hour drive from Toronto we can buy a home and put a huge amount of money (too us) in the bank. Hey, then we can buy a place in the country too!!! In Costa Rica maybe. I'm second guessing selling the places down south now.  Sorry for the rant, felt great."
1007008,jimmer,2017-06-20 18:29:00,2730,Glad you made a decision you and your wife are happy with.  That's what matters.

1007013,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-20 19:08:00,8243,"Thanks for the votes of confidence guys. Now I have to go through the 7 pages of ""to do's"" that I should have been doing for the last 5 years. Sometimes you just have to call the ""guy"" to do it right and timely. That is if we want to get top price. We could have it all done by September, they do it every episode of those TV shows in less than an hour. I have to remind my loved one they don't show you the 15 workers off camera. Fall isn't the best time to sell lakefront property in my experience but real estate is changing so fast. A place that we actually walked through 3 winters ago in Cayuga but we passed on because it wasn't the right place, had a pool and a big hill to cut grass. It sold after being on the market for less than 2 days this past weekend. It listed for 150K more now than 3 years back, was $249,000 listed for $399,000.00 and they may have gotten more. That's a 60% increase in 3 years, actually less than 3 yrs, Wowza. I don't think our place has gone up as much in percentage, not sure. Lots to do including finding out what we can get now without all the little spruce ups that may be a waste of time. I have experience in buying and selling and have done well so far. I am afraid if I do everything on the list my wife will want to stay. She can if she so desires, we can visit on weekends so I can take her boat out."

A place we could afford 2 years ago when it was for sale is back on the market for 400 grand more. I will always regret not buying that one.. 50 acres and a beautiful house.. Oh well, you should do well on the sale.. Simcoe has some nice places for a decent price...along with Waterford, Caledonia etc..."

1007029,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-20 20:35:00,8243,"I have many regrets over properties I shoulda, woulda. Hind sight is 20/20 Pics. Keeping up with local real estate has always been a hobby and now it's my wifes hobby too for the last 3 years. It tells me the best values right now are around us are Simcoe, Waterford and even Dunnville. Dunnville was not so long ago the Crack capital of southern Ontario, it has really cleaned up. One of those shoulda's was a beautiful fully reno'd place right with an unobstructed view across from the river and the launch above the dam 2 years ago. It is 250K more now. People have caught onto Dunnville, a nice place doesn't last a week on the market. I know where you are now Pics and know all to well where you work. Dunnville isn't much further than you are now. Check it out. And you are near some great fishing on the river and very close to the lake. Some very good value there especially with acreage. Check out Dunnville. We are looking there at a Condo complex actually. Then I can keep the boat at Fishmasters for cheap. Far better real estate values than Caledonia. I have always loved Waterford. A few guys I know that worked at the lake live there. 1 of them took a job at Hilton Works and drove it every day. It wasn't that bad a drive if you know the short cuts.  The prices aren't going down."
1007033,leaf4,2017-06-20 21:01:00,2466,Definitely sounds like a wise move!  And as stated Caledonia hasn't slowed down it's market... I've been keeping an eye on it and comparing apples to apples I'd say my house has appreciated at least 50k already based on improvements I've done here along with the market
1007038,dave524,2017-06-20 22:51:00,4508,"glad I bought here in 83 @ 55 grand for a corner lot with a small bungalow, today it's a nice retirement home , 1 block walking distance to the lake and marinas. I don't know how you kids do it today in this crazy market, there was a downward correction in market value around '90, one neighbour handed their keys back to the bank for a loss after he was laid off , I see it happening again if interest rates rise any. Think it was around '79 they hit 18% for a five year fixed  Edit : amazingly , the neighbours either side and over the back fence are the same people that were here in 83, all good people"

They paid close to 300K for a fixer upper, and I mean a fixer upper in a working class neighbourhood in St. Kitts. They saved like maniacs and with the help of both sets of Grand Parents, my brother and sis in law can't help, they came up with 30 grand down. That leaves a 260K mortgage they are looking forward to for the rest of their lives. I couldn't get to sleep with a 50 grand mortgage on a 100 grand house in 85' that was a brand new build. Between the 2 of them they pull in a bit above $100,000.00 a year. In 85' my former wife and I were making around 50. We were much better off than them if you do the math. These Gen Xers sure get a wake up call between the ages of 25 and 30. I hired her for a summer 12 years ago and couldn't get her to sweep a floor, she doesn't do floors she said, I'm a receptionist. My business partner wasn't such a pushover went I took a week off, she quit in defiance. She thought it was included in her employment that Uncle Johnny pick her up and drive her to work everyday, Uncle Dominic didn't think so. Then her mother begged us to take her back, floors and windows included. Do I digress much?  I always say I was born at the right time. You took a bus and got off the wrong stop, could walk into a plant or business and got a job for 35 years, a pension and benefits.

I see it all around me, and the clients pay the bills because they fill their time sheet full everyday! This is crazy way to learn!  I have four kids and all took my ethics when it came to work and are now feeling the payment deal that I had once. They make a great income  it hopefully this doesn't burst.  Come to Woddy learn the lingo and drink espresso.  I had a home sell down the street from me 3bdrm bungalow one bedroom was smaller than my closet (1999) they paid 1.2 mil.

I know of 3 places that went for absurd amounts of $$$ and the buyers backed out.  So it's either release them from their contract and keep the deposit, or sue them.   It's a crappy situation for the sellers, but people must have known there was no way that was sustainable.   Houses are still going for over ask, but there are a lot more prices corrections these last few weeks (gf is a realtor, I have heard some interesting phone calls, lol!)
