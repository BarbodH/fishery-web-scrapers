1006649,LittleWorm,2017-06-16 03:04:00,122,"Looking for a fishing report for Pike Lake that is near Perth Ontario off the scotch line. My dad and I are thinking of trying it but have never fished it. If anyone on here has fished it ( especially this year ) any advice on how to fish it, good place and what bait seems to work or what areas of the lake to avoid that may have hidden rocks/stumps would be greatly appreciated. May not be going for 2 weeks, will depend on work and weather.  Thanks, Eric"
