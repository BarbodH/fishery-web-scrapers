Used the old small black and white portable Eagle Ultra to find clouds of baitfish and dropped the lures into the schools.

1006795,dave524,2017-06-17 23:26:00,4508,I've caught a few on Worden's Spin and Glows behind a Gang Troll when I didn't have any big minnows to put there.
1006802,smitty55,2017-06-18 03:17:00,928,"I was taught how to fish Lakers using lead core and gang trolls with a threaded bait 20"" or more behind and it is still my preferred method. I just like trolling and learning the lake and seeing as I spent so many weeks at Kipawa it was by far the best way to explore that huge waterway. Funny enough, even my buds with riggers were still pulling big hammers off the ball and they always produced better than the spoon on a stacker. I've been salting minnows since Quebec outlawed live bait. I would buy a big wack of Emeralds late winter for all our Quebec fishing but sadly that is no more. Sterling you didn't specify for what technique you were using the minnows for but if you are referring to on a leader behind a troll or a spoon then I have some alternatives for you.  Gulp minnows do work, what I've done is use two on the treble hooked through the head with the two adjacent barbs, as it seems to track better that way than with three.  That same guy that taught me also showed me a little known trick for behind a big hammer. He would actually go to this little lake in the middle of Ottawa at a certain time of the year and catch a couple dozen of a certain size range sunfish from shore. Here's the kicker. You cut the tail off and use that threaded on the leader behind the gang troll. I've used it and it works quite well at times. One nice thing about it is that it usually tracks well with no spin even after a hit or catching bottom. And guess what? You can even legally use a perch tail in Ontario so long as you don't allow any meat fit for consumption to go to waste, so a normal fillet method would leave enough to use. I just found this out from a recent interview I watched that a member of Fish Hawk had with a CO. But don't tell anyone ok... hehe  Cheers"
