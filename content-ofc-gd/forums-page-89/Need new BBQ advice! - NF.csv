Its almost 100% stainless steel, including the grills and its a good price.  The small one they had is not all stainless.  Its all stainless so I expect you would get 10 years out of it or more, even if it is Chinese steel.  Personally, after owning many over the years, I finally splurged and got a Weber Summit a few years ago.  At the same time, two neighbours bout the same size Napolean's.  Mine is still like new and theirs have had the normal issues with rusty burners and grills (they got the cast iron grills).  at that $2K price, I don't think you can go wrong with Weber.

At home I have a 15+ year old broil mate that has had 1 new set of grills and is on it's second set of burners. Great  inexpensive BBQ that just keeps going 12 months of the year.Happy with it so I bought a broil mate for the cottage around 2012. COMPLETE JUNK. Still get frustrated almost every time I use it. Have used many propane BBQ's at family members. My brother really liked his Napoleon but it never lasted....so I'm a little hesitant to give them a go.  Started doing my research last year and have decided that my next propane BBQ will be a Broil King. Just have to decide which model to go with.

1006366,manjo39,2017-06-13 19:29:00,354,"I have a gas bbq, a Traegar smoker and a Large Green Egg  Each have their advantages and disadvantages.  BBQ you can turn it on use it quickly, turn it off and your done, great for after work,  rushed evenings making dinner.  EGG is a lot more involved, you need to light the charcoal, let it go through the motions letting the charcoal burn properly and let it get hot which usually takes about half hour to 45 minutes. Great for Saturday and Sunday cooking. Also your cook space on the egg being circular is limited, I have the large egg and I can only get about 8 burgers on it comfortably. There are optional tiered racks but I find them a pain in the butt to work with, no side burners, no control over temperatures from one side of the grill to the other like with a gas bbq.  You can get the egg from 200 to 600 or 700 degrees, so your temps are very flexible. I did smoke some ribs one time and they turned out amazing on the egg, pizza is good, steak is good, its all good but its more of a weekend BBQ play toy drinking beer with buddies.  Traegar is awesome for brisket, ribs, fish, chicken etc, although they advertise it as a grill, it is not a grill, it is a smoker.  Low and slow. Love my Traegar, makes ribs and brisket to die for.  I bought a high end Napolean from Ontario Gas BBQ  7 years ago, ($2000.00 bbq), worked great the first season. It was a propane grill and started to go through  propane like it was water. Every time I turned around the tank was empty and no it was not leaking. It went through 20 lbs of propane like 2 lb bottles, would never get hot, took forever. I complained with no luck to Ontario Gas BBQ, ended up I just scrapped it in the scrap metal drive here in town, never again will I buy a Napolean. So much for buying Canadian. Absolutely hated that BBQ, most expensive piece of scrap I ever bought.  I have a Weber now and have had great luck with it after about 4 years, would definitely consider another Weber.  Just my experience.  I also have a BGE and a Napoleon natural gas.  Agree with everything said above.  There is a learning curve with the Egg and you develop a relationship with it.  To add, to get volume out of the egg, you need to stack vertically or use rib racks etc.cook roasts etc.  Its great for roasts of any kind especially roast chicken.  I agree you need time to use it.  Some say it only takes 15 minutes to get it to 900, but I find you need to let the fire burn for a bit to get the desired blue smoke to eliminate the rancid smoke flavour for the delicious clean charcoal flavour.  I've had my Napoleon for 16 years.  The key is the stainless steel parts to achieve the longevity.  I had an issue with the sear plates, called Napolean after the warranty had well expired and they send me new parts no charge.  My next natural gas BBQ will be a Napoleon.  If I had to decide today, I'd look at the Traeger Timberline series (set it and forget it) and compare with the BGE for my charcoal/smoking needs.  And get a Napoleon for quick grilling."

I just got back from BBQ World in Whitby.... interesting place, but in reality, they have a fairly limited selection; Napoleon, Weber, Broil King and then stuff north of 5K. They also have a number of charcoal units of various size and configuration. After seeing what's there and the pricing attached to some of the stuff, I am now leaning back towards a gas grill vs EGG etc... I need a side burner as I refuse to heat my house in the summer with my stove. Combine the costs associated with the BGE or any of the other similar units, I am getting close to 3K for what I would want -  too much money for this boy! I looked at both Weber and Broil King - if forced, I would get the Broil King as the Weber feels like a toy to me. That all said, the winner so far, is the Napoleon Prestige 5. Big enough for my needs, has the infra-red side burner, rotisserie that I don't want/need and can run charcoal as well. My biggest challenge in truth, is that the bar has been set pretty darn high, with my current unit. Bought in 2003, I have not had one thing go wrong, until recently. I have expectations that my next unit ""should"" last that long, probably unrealistic.

My brother, using his Egg, cooked 50lbs of pulled pork on his egg and brought it to a party we had. He also makes his own bacon on it. I have some interest in smoking, but it is not my main concern. Also, my brother uses his egg year round, uses an electric charcoal starter and tells me he can get up to 900F in 15 minutes. That's pretty quick. My biggest issue with the Egg, is a lack of a side burner. I know I can build a system, inclusive of the egg and side burner, but that leads me to a further expense and a construction project to integrate both into one package. So, that's why I am looking at both gas and charcoal. Friends with the high end Napoleon are getting less than a decade out of their BBQ's, maybe I am spoiled! HH"

Sounds like a gas would be better and u can still smoke on that with a proper cast iron smoke box and chunks (not fan of chips).  when I win the lottery and buy my dream cottage, on a nice pike and bass lake, this is what I'll be getting to help feed the masses   that thing eats a HUGE bag of lump like a snack lol  https://www.weber.com/US/en/grills/ranch-kettle-charcoal-grill"
1006295,Dan668,2017-06-13 14:33:00,1120,"I bought a kamado big Joe last year after summer as a clear out before the huge price increase, and it is fantastic. Haven't used my Broil King BBQ since. Have used it for grilling, smoking and pizzas. It does take slightly longer, as the coals have to get lit, but if you plan your meal prior, not a big deal starting it up and then prepping while it heats."
1006309,ketchenany,2017-06-13 15:01:00,3229,"have you tried ONTARIO BBQ, they are huge and have an amazing selection. They have opened one in the east end."
1006312,ketchenany,2017-06-13 15:10:00,3229,Their name has changed to Barbecue World. Locations in Vaughan Whitby and Kanata.  https://www.barbecueworld.com/
1006325,misfish,2017-06-13 15:43:00,29133,"Hey Joe. Napoleon is open on the weekends. You can buy direct from the factory store. I will say this though. They are not like they were years back. Before it was 100% made in Canada. They now bring parts in from China. So Made in Canada, should read, assembled in Canada."
1006327,F7Firecat,2017-06-13 15:48:00,347,"I have a gas bbq, a Traegar smoker and a Large Green Egg  Each have their advantages and disadvantages.  BBQ you can turn it on use it quickly, turn it off and your done, great for after work,  rushed evenings making dinner.  EGG is a lot more involved, you need to light the charcoal, let it go through the motions letting the charcoal burn properly and let it get hot which usually takes about half hour to 45 minutes. Great for Saturday and Sunday cooking. Also your cook space on the egg being circular is limited, I have the large egg and I can only get about 8 burgers on it comfortably. There are optional tiered racks but I find them a pain in the butt to work with, no side burners, no control over temperatures from one side of the grill to the other like with a gas bbq.  You can get the egg from 200 to 600 or 700 degrees, so your temps are very flexible. I did smoke some ribs one time and they turned out amazing on the egg, pizza is good, steak is good, its all good but its more of a weekend BBQ play toy drinking beer with buddies.  Traegar is awesome for brisket, ribs, fish, chicken etc, although they advertise it as a grill, it is not a grill, it is a smoker.  Low and slow. Love my Traegar, makes ribs and brisket to die for.  I bought a high end Napolean from Ontario Gas BBQ  7 years ago, ($2000.00 bbq), worked great the first season. It was a propane grill and started to go through  propane like it was water. Every time I turned around the tank was empty and no it was not leaking. It went through 20 lbs of propane like 2 lb bottles, would never get hot, took forever. I complained with no luck to Ontario Gas BBQ, ended up I just scrapped it in the scrap metal drive here in town, never again will I buy a Napolean. So much for buying Canadian. Absolutely hated that BBQ, most expensive piece of scrap I ever bought.  I have a Weber now and have had great luck with it after about 4 years, would definitely consider another Weber.  Just my experience."

They make pellet smoker grills that have wifi lol.  I've heard lots of positive feedback on them in my limited research into them  https://greenmountaingrills.com"
1006331,manitoubass2,2017-06-13 16:26:00,11391,Why does a BBQ need Wi-Fi? Lol
1006332,Headhunter,2017-06-13 16:26:00,5703,"smellybox, that is not the experience I have heard from my brother. He has had his Egg for years. He uses an electric charcoal starter and he tells me 15 minutes is all it takes to get it up to temp. That's pretty much what my VC takes to get to operating temperature. I should have mentioned in my OP that I will not consider Weber as to my mind, they are way over priced for what you get. Lucas F, I will have a look at green mountain grills and thanks for the suggestion. Brian, Napoleon has been on my radar for a while now, but friends who have them, bought in the last decade or so, have had problems to the point of requiring a full re-build. I would like to avoid that. Keep 'em coming folks, I really do appreciate all input - except Weber!LOL HH"
1006333,manitoubass2,2017-06-13 16:31:00,11391,"Have you looked at Blaze BBQs?  Or the broil king regal s590 is another great propane grill(after my pops bought one and seeing how great it is, im getting one myself)"

1006335,Dara,2017-06-13 16:36:00,3052,I'm not going to be much help here for you but maybe others.  I buy the cheapest one I can find of the size I need. It lasts about 5 or 6 years and then trash it The last one I got was identical to the previous and it cost $179.00 at Home depot Does everything I want it to do.
1006338,manitoubass2,2017-06-13 16:46:00,11391, I shopped around on a site called BBQ guys.com  Lotsa nice grills on there and reviews too
1006341,AKRISONER,2017-06-13 16:52:00,5558,bought a napoleon...havent been extremely impressed with it...my brothers broil king is fairing much better than mine.  I do like the grills on the napoleon much better though.
1006343,Headhunter,2017-06-13 16:58:00,5703,"Thanks Dara, i have been down the cheap BBQ road. MY VC cost me over 2K 14 years ago. Doing the math, that equals about $150.00 /year for a fantastic BBQ that NEVER let me down. Heck, I could put a pound of bacon on the grills and it would not flame up! I am hoping for a similar experience as I have had with my VC. Heck, I'll take a decade of solid use, if I can find the right tool. I BBQ about 150 times a year, cooking everything you typically grill and everything else from cakes to lasagna. It's important to me that I have a good BBQ that I can and will rely on. HH"
1006346,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-13 17:08:00,10439,​I think one of these Louisiana Grills pellet units is going to be my next purchase. Love that they're made here too.  http://www.louisiana-grills.com/  
1006348,davis,2017-06-13 17:21:00,128,"LOVE my BGE. It is possible to get it to cooking temp in about 15 - 20 mins - look for tips on YouTube. I get home too late during the week so it mostly gets used on weekends while my old gas Weber holds down the weekdays. After much research, i went with the XL and have no regrets. I'd advise not to go any smaller if you can afford it.  Best thing i've made on it to date - grilled rabbit. Brined for 24hrs. Was incredible. I've also done our thanksgiving turkey on it and pizza (using the pizza stone)."
1006351,manitoubass2,2017-06-13 17:40:00,11391," I def. Don't mind paying top dollar for a great grill. I too BBQ at least 150 days per year. Those cheap units can't handle the volume, or they heat uneven or whatever. Not worth the hassle unless you just cook hotdogs or burgers.  When you find the one, let us know what ya got!"

Web sites are good for narrowing things down, but I'm a hands on guy and I need to touch them if you know what I mean!LOL HH"
1006355,manitoubass2,2017-06-13 18:01:00,11391,"Yep! I only use the web as a guide. Buy local where I can see the products(for me that means Winnipeg lol.  Check out that broilking unit though. I've used my dad's and it's awesome! Can't speak on longevity as he just got it last summer, but it's built well. No chinsy parts, cooks as even as possible, no flare ups, and if I remember correctly it's a 40"". I think it retails around $1200 ish which is not bad at all.  I hardly use our oven lol. Between the BBQ and crock pot, the oven is basically just used for sauces/side dishes if needed  Why cook inside when you can cook outside?"
