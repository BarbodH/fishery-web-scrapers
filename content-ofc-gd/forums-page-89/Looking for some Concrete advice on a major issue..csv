Its not monolithic but it would likely work well for you."

1006785,ch312,2017-06-17 20:18:00,1590,"Agreed the 10"" at the side was just to act as a curb and push water away from the pad.   If the water made it to the pad and buckled I would be ""PO'ed"" but accept it as a drainage issue.  My problem is with the 6"" I lose the Curb appeal  and I requested 10"".. So if it buckles is that because it was 6"" or because the drainage ;(  I'm in charge of prepping the base and placing/finishing concrete for jobs ranging from 4 to 6 digits in value and am still not fully understanding what you're describing. Did you want this:  A)    |___________|  or  ___________ |                      |    As for spending money and doing it right, many problem areas can be remedied by installing weeping tile with multiple weepers to allow water to leech into the surrounding soil rather than sitting below the slab. If the ground is clay they should have excavated a minimum of 18"", packed clay with a jumping jack, installed landscape fabric, 12"" of B gravel, followed by A gravel to final grade being sure to add only as much material as their plate tamper could adequately pack per lift. A huge problem we often see is some people think tossing 12"" of gravel in a hole and packing it with their little plate tamper is sufficient when in reality their tamper is only rated for 3-4"" lifts.  Some jobs require base preparation which greatly exceeds the cost of concrete and labor to place/finish it. You run into problems when neither the contractor or customer refuse to accept this."

I needed to put a backyard concrete patio in, I knew where the concrete pad was to be located had bad drainage So I had the company that was doing the work come in and inspect in the spring.  6-8 "" of water (clay under the grass)  One of the suggestion was to put 5-6"" in the center and put 10"" around the perimeter. The 10"" on the outside would act as a curb and deflect water.  Along with changing the drainage this should solve the problem.  The 10"" came with an extra cost but I thought it would really help. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now the issue, company pouring the concrete did not get a copy of the actual contract or the details and poured a 6"" pad all around (re-bar / granular /etc was installed)  They only dug down a tiny bit so the 6"" is level with the yard not dug down.  Not what at all was in a signed contract, will not help the deflection of water.  If water gets where I know it will the concrete will heave,  They offered me a 1 year warranty on heaving. (I laughed)  I was thinking a 10 year on heaving,  I clearly have the contract and could sue but the fix is to remove and redo this is a major head ache,  I have the hold back on 50% of the cost and won't release it.

It sounds like you wanted a flat pad with a 10"" deep perimeter, which is typically done for sheds and garages to support the load, not for addressing water issues.

But Lexxington paid someone to cross all those T's and dot those I's and IMO they were really looking after him they would've told him to address the drainage issue before hand, and told him that the 10"" curb wouldn't do much if anything to deflect water and put down the proper substrate material.

The ball is in your court now, they may just walk depending on what a tear out redo will be, especially if it will cost more than the 50% you hold.
