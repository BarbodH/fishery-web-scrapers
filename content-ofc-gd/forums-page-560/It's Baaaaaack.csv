HOLY EIGHT INCHES OF SNOW batman !!!!!  I'm sorry .. but the road to Lake Joseph looks like it might be open for the weekend

I might even  be able to take a pi-cher fer ya ... but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO .... (insert SNL Steve Martin scowl here) .... Iiiiiiiiiiiiii had to give my sim card to my Mrs. to get her phone working so Theyyyyyyyyyyyyy could re-coop her number and get my daughter's phone (in London) working again on her old number (which was mysteriously hijacked some time last night and prevent my wife's number from being given away to the next higest bidder .... don't ask .. I can't actually make it sound simpler than that  Bottom line ... no pictures for a few days until we get the new phone so I can use that sim card to re-activate my fancy (albeit DEAD) torch ... of course .. with any luck at all .. the snow will have melted and there wont be any pictures worth posting  Do i sound stressed ???? Well oyu shoulda been here three scotches ago !
