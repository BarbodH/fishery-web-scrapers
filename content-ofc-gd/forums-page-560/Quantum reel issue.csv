I thought I would sen an email to quantum service asking what parts I could replace, they apologized and sen to send them to them and they would fix them up. Other than the shipping to the us, I am happy with this service. I with they had a depot in Canada but at leat they will fix them. That's good news for me. Hopefully I get them back before the bass season.  So far two thumbs up for quantum service."

Sent in a tour edition pt baitcaster that I broke the clutch sleeve on, they fixed it and sent it back within a week. Sent in multiple rods as well, no questions. Just ship them the piece of they blank with the model number, so it can go in a standard envelope, and they shipped back new rods."
