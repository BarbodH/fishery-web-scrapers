564466,Harrison,2011-03-22 13:06:00,2202,Great report Dan.  Looks like you had a blast!
564562,Moosebunk,2011-03-22 16:51:00,3970,"Read this last night from work and tried twice to reply with no luck.  Anyways Dan, I got this sense from the report that you felt humbled, slightly excited and quite happy to get this experience.  It could haven't worked out better for a nicer fella, and Lord knows you could use that break from work.  Enjoyed that very much bud.  First and last pics are the best this time around.     Got that right."
564574,ehg,2011-03-22 17:12:00,2666,I remember a post you did of a tour inside a Hydro-Electric plant on Nipigon River many years ago.  I thought that was the greatest then but this photo account is the best. Congrats on everything and thanks for taking the time putting this together.
564609,misfish,2011-03-22 18:34:00,29133,Wow great read Dan.Looks like you truely enjoyed your trip. TFS
564656,jediangler,2011-03-22 20:35:00,1923,Nice pics Dan. Schenn's goal and Dion tucking his chin in and wearing a visor for a fight after his opponent took his helmet off. Funny how he wasn't interested in dropping the gloves when the Bruin's captain wanted to go. I guess he knew a visor wouldn't have helped him against the big man. Rematch and a beating coming to Dion on March 31st.
564670,perchslayer666,2011-03-22 20:53:00,280,"Awesome!!!! Great shots, and actually going into the dressing room after the game, talking to Dion, must have been incredible!!! Very cool."
564671,Handlebarz,2011-03-22 20:53:00,3790,Thats just Awesome Dan glad to here it all worked out and I to would think this was alot better then hitting the ice with him. Any true blue leaf fan would die to get into that room for just a few min.  I still wish it was a M&G before the game so we could swamp you for your autograph that would have been great.
564679,perchslayer666,2011-03-22 21:10:00,280,"  Are you kidding me??? Who in there right mind would fight Chara???? For Dion to fight Chara would be suicide.  Now if Muhammad Aulie fought Chara, that would be totally different."
564684,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-22 21:22:00,4399," Now that you mention it the visor has not been mentioned much, when PK does that he gets grilled for it big time!!!  I would think Horton will be looking for Dion next game."
564689,jediangler,2011-03-22 21:29:00,1923,"Immediately following the game Don Cherry tore into Dion, in his post game rant, about the helmet and visor and about turning down the opposing captain but agreeing to fight a first liner. He showed Horton taking his helmet off and laying it down on the ice before approaching Dion. Dion reached up to his helmet and pulled it down to cover his face before the fight. Cherry was very dissappointed and he is the one who said Dion will be dealt with on the 31st."
564695,aplumma,2011-03-22 21:36:00,6896,Wow what a great evening for you Dan thanks for the report and letting us feel like we tagged along.   Art
564290,danc,2011-03-22 00:33:00,4677,"It's been about 20 years since I last visited Toronto. A few things have changed since I last visited. Apparently nobody has informed metro Toronto that there is a major global recession taking place as the number of condos under construction and the number of construction cranes I saw were truly mind boggling. Maybe it's the time of year but I remember Toronto being a much cleaner place. The downtown streets were littered with cigarette butts with very few places to dispose of them. No doubt that this is the result of the new smoking bylaws which makes everyone smoke outside now. When I attended George Brown College in Toronto we could smoke right in class.  All in all it was great to be back though.  Of course the reason that I was there in the first place was because I was to be a guest of the fine people at DeWALT to the Leafs Bruins game, some wining and dining, and to meet Leafs captain after the game somewhere in the ACC. My friend and I were to meet Jocelyn from DeWALT at the Real Sports bar and grill at 4:30 Saturday before the game. Now, if you ever get the chance to visit Real Sports, do it. It’s quite impressive and a great place to spend an hour or two before the game.  Our hostess at Real Sports.    My buddy Colin with our host Jocelyn from DeWALT at Real Sports.    I wanted to get into the ACC sooner rather than later because I had a 70-150mm camera lens with me. I had already asked security about it outside the gate and was told that I couldn’t have it inside. I was expecting to have to check it in and wasn’t sure how long that would take.  A while later, with my 14-42mm lens on my camera, and my 70-150 in a pouch attached to my belt on my right hip, I walked right in. Wearing my baggy autographed Phaneuf jersey to the game was already paying dividends. We had fantastic seats. Golds, 12 rows up on the players bench side of the Bruins end zone. Jocelyn would be sitting with Phaneufs agent elsewhere in the rink. Before the game, there was a nice tribute to the 60th anniversary of Bill Barilkos overtime Stanley cup winning goal. Howie Meeker, whom I believe assisted on the goal, was there, as was Barilkos sister. Ironically, Bill disappeared the following summer while on a fly in fishing trip in Northern Ontario. His remains were found a decade later. Finally it was time to drop the puck. The crowd was abuzz as the Leafs put on some early pressure.    One problem that I did have with my seating was that many of my shots had to be taken either through the glass or the mesh above the glass. So you might see this effect is some of them.    If any of you were wondering where Doobie was Saturday night, she was sitting two rows in front of me, and for the most part, was behaving herself.    Luke Schenn made an incredible rush to score his tenth goal of the season. I was lucky enough to catch the puck hitting the mesh in this shot.    As most of you know by now, the Leafs were being outshot but were piling up the goals. Young Joey Crabb (ironically from Anchorage AK, the crab capital of the world) really made an impression on me scoring a goal and adding a couple of helpers. He also threw a couple of nice body checks and just missed lining up a couple of other guys as well.  Watch this kid. There were a few other things going on during the game as well. It was Kaberle’s first game back in Toronto after his trade. There was a standing ovation for him during the second period.    And Zdeno Chara is still in the hot seat for his check in Montreal a couple of weeks ago. He was booed loudly every time he touched the puck. During a third period Leafs power play, he took a hard shot in the leg that left him hobbling around. That was the only cheer he got all night.    The third period was kinda slow with the Leafs having the game well in hand. Bruins Nathan Horton thought that it would be a good idea to get into a fight with Phaneuf. It wasn’t. I was able to ask Dion about this later that night.    So the game ended with the Leafs winning 5 to 2. I was now time to meet up with Jocelyn and Phaneufs agent. Nice guy but I forget his name. He was to take us downstairs somewhere near the Leafs dressing room to meet with Dion. We followed him through a series of corridors and several security check points. “They’re with me” was all he needed to say to get us through. When we were just around the corner from the dressing room, he told us to wait where we were and he’d go ahead and find out just exactly where Dion wanted to meet us. Several minutes later he came back and said “You’re in luck. He wants to see you guys in the dressing room”.  Wow. This was getting exciting. Soon we were escorted through some very heavy security points and finally turned the last corner into the dressing room. Dion was standing there waiting for us. Now I’m an old sports fan from years back, so to say that this was thrilling is an understatement. How many people get the chance to meet the Leafs captain in the dressing room after a game? Thanks DeWALT!    Dion signs a hat for Colin.    And finally. Are you ready for it? Here it comes. Me and my buddy Dion Phaneuf!    Dion was very humble and receptive towards us. He didn’t seem rushed to get our meeting over and done with asap. He signed a lot of items for us and took time to talk with us and answer any questions. He was very well spoken too. It was a pleasure meeting him. I asked him why he seemed angry after the fight. He said it was because he didn’t want to fight. It was pointless. Leafs were up 5 to 1 at the time and Horton was egging him on. So a big thanks to DeWALT and to Jocelyn for a great weekend!    And just a bit of advice to everyone. If you see a contest that interests you online or anywhere else, just enter it. You never know."
564295,BillM,2011-03-22 00:37:00,17367,"Dan, great recap bud!!!"
564297,solopaddler,2011-03-22 00:43:00,8605,"Just fantastic, wow!  Glad to hear everything went well Dan, and nice to hear Phaneuf made a good impression.  He's had a lot of criticism heaped on him, but I'm a fan and am glad he's on the team.  Would have liked to have met you at the sportsmans show, but I guess the timing wasn't right."
564299,skeeter,2011-03-22 00:46:00,1907,Excellent report Dan !!!!!!!
564303,danbouck,2011-03-22 00:47:00,4380,
564304,Pigeontroller,2011-03-22 00:48:00,2793,I woulda been more excited about meeting Jocelyn than Dion...
564305,ADB,2011-03-22 00:49:00,444,"Great story, Dan."
564307,Twocoda,2011-03-22 00:51:00,4130,
564308,ketchenany,2011-03-22 00:54:00,3229,"I haven't followed the Leafs for many year Dan, but that was great report. I did have work buddy who' s roommate was Verb Buffy (ref) and had memorable nights at the hot stove in the old gardens."
564312,mercman,2011-03-22 00:57:00,7054,Nice report and excellent memories Dan !!! You are a lucky Dude all round  Cheers Paul
564314,irishfield,2011-03-22 00:58:00,26272,Glad the trip went well Dan !!
564321,ctranter,2011-03-22 01:04:00,543,Nice game shots!  I agree that Joey Krabb has lots of potential.  He has tons of work ethic and can skate his butt off.  I was under the impression that DSLR's were ok at the ACC so long as they don't record video or take continuous shots.  I guess there is a max lens size too?  Good to know!  Thanks for the report.
564322,Rod Caster,2011-03-22 01:04:00,5784,Fantastic! What a good time.
564329,Roy,2011-03-22 01:09:00,13728,"Fantastic report Dan! So glad you had a great time! Some beauty shots too. That'll be quite a memory for you. And BTW, her name is Jocelyne."
564336,Grimace,2011-03-22 01:20:00,2020,Really cool.   Really really cool.   What a great game to be at.
564341,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-22 01:28:00,2690,"Awewsome!!  You got to see a great effort by the Leafs as well.  Schenn's goal was ""Orr-like"" which is ironic, since it was scored against the Bruins.  Reimer stood on his head too. Sounds like you had a great time"
564342,kerr,2011-03-22 01:29:00,77,"That might be the report of the year! awesome pics dude, Go Leafs Go"
564346,fishnsled,2011-03-22 01:31:00,3520,AWESOME!! Best ice report of the year!!
564356,tb4me,2011-03-22 01:51:00,3295,Awesome and thanks for sharing your adventure..Dion is a tough man thats for sure..
564363,John,2011-03-22 02:03:00,2956,"Thanks for sharing Dan, sounds like a great time.."
564364,walleyejack,2011-03-22 02:06:00,358,Very good report and excellent shots and a good game to see. well done. You could proably get a job with the Toronto Sun
564367,Cudz,2011-03-22 02:10:00,2652,very cool. I had almost those exact same seats last week when the Leafs beat the Sabres.  I was section 115 row 14.  I too ate pretty much the whole menu at real sports bar.  I however did not get to meet the players or go into the dressing room. A bit jealous over here. Congrats.
564378,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-22 02:40:00,4399,"Wow what a experience, any time the Bruins lose it`s a good thing.  And thanks Dion for kicking some Bruin"
564381,Joey,2011-03-22 02:48:00,9122,"Excellent report of that Dan, just like I was there.  Some really good shots too, especially the puck in the net shot.  Looked like a great time and wonderful experience  Joey"
564396,camillj,2011-03-22 03:25:00,1988,"Nice job all round Dan ! I always knew you had a knack with the camera, but those are some great shots especially the one with the puck at the back of the twine !  Now ... get back up there and start sending us those golden shots of Nipigon Specks !!!"
