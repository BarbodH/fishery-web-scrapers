565207,codered,2011-03-23 21:31:00,123,I was thinking about taking the boat up the holland river for a fish on saturday is there any point to fishing the river this time of year ? I have never fished for ice out pike and was wondering of if it was worth trying for pike? Has any one done this before ? Any tips tricks or experianced info would be amazing . or mabey should I try for panfish or  perch? thanks guys and tight lines...
