564541,4x4bassin,2011-03-22 16:26:00,1025,Does anyone know the ice conditions in the inland Parry Sound area ? Might be heading up that way this weekend for a bit of late ice fishing but i'm not too sure. Looks like the Muskoka lakes still have lots of ice so it should be okay a little more north I would think ! Thanks
