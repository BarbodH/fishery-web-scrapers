I was looking at a sidescan unit as well, but remembered I had to eat and live somewhere, so I left that  It has taken me almost a day just to pull the boat apart and pull the 2 fishfinders off that were on there from the previous owner. These boats are really put together really really well. It nice to see.  one thing I cant get over is the size difference from moving from a 17'10 Princecraft 179 LX (which I am selling if you know anyone looking for a great fishing boat) to the 198 SP. Its MASSIVE. Absolutely my dream boat."

563920,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-21 01:15:00,35,"I already wired it up and didnt take pics - sorry  The best advice I can give you is get wire strippers, fuses and definitely a wire fish to thread the cable. I always use shrink tube on my connections as well.  I will snap some pics tomorrow since I have to get it out of our shop and move it home"
