We just picked up our newest member of the family on thursday, his name is Loki ( and he is living up to his name )  His father is Munch of the Iam's dogfood commercial, the bulldog with the insides that running like a well oiled machine.  The breeder took this photo and others for us before we picked him up, I think he will be in a few calendars coming up she said.  7lbs of fury!!  "
