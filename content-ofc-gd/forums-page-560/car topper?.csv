They both has a sign that says ""authorized boats not allowed"" or something like that to stop the boats that uses gas. I've seen ppl in the lake with aluminum boats in there with a trolling moter mounted to it and i've gotten tired of paddling...anyone have any suggestions regard to the size of boat i should get to replace the canoe on my car top and the estimated price for the set up? ( i'm looking for used ones ) Also, i'd love to take it off your hands if anyone who has something like that they would like to get rid of with a reasonable price =] thx"
564028,Live2fish85,2011-03-21 15:04:00,1633,You can get a little zodiac and mount a trolling motor or a electric motor that is probably your best chance. They are a lot easier to move around with out a trailer.
564032,Woodsman,2011-03-21 15:09:00,1286,What about putting a small electric on the canoe?
564043,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-21 15:22:00,10439,"  Exactly!!! No need to replace your canoe, just add a 30# electric and a motor mount."

564114,Sinker,2011-03-21 18:11:00,8692,"Are you sure your allowed to use your boat in that lake?? I know some lakes where boats are not allowed, in order to stop the transfer of invasive species, and the signs say the same as what your seeing. Doesn't matter if you have a gas or electric motor, your boat isn't allowed in the lake.  S."
564125,Nipfisher,2011-03-21 18:34:00,2449,"Does the sign say ""No motorized boats""? A piece of 2x4 and a couple of angle brackets makes for an excellent motor mount. Just notch the wood to fit on the gunnals and support it with the angle brackets. Cheap 20-30lbs trolling motors are commonly found for under $100."
564139,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-21 18:58:00,0,"for the money you'll spend on a car topper, i'd invest in a small aluminum and trailer but that's just me.  or as has been suggested, an electric on a canoe works wonderfully."
564164,Raf,2011-03-21 19:58:00,3495,i think he meant motorized boats.
564168,irishfield,2011-03-21 20:09:00,26272,Yah... maybe go back and read the sign again ! lol  Remember a canoe.. with a trolling motor becomes a motorized vessel and you'll need a boaters card.
564373,newboykool,2011-03-22 02:33:00,81,"Thank you all for the replies =] to be honest , i don't remember what the exact words are on the sign lol but i'm 100% sure that electric motors are allowed it's just saying that boats with like..gas motors aren't allowed i guess i'll just go look for a trolling motor and mount it to the canoe but i'll be still open for any one who wants to get rid of their car topper =] once again~ thank you guys =]"

564413,dhickey,2011-03-22 04:08:00,1038,some of my biggest fish have been cought in a cannoe with electric motor/its quite the rush!!  
564676,splashhopper,2011-03-22 20:59:00,2931,  I second that ....  
564693,jediangler,2011-03-22 21:36:00,1923,  Splash knows.
564787,NAW,2011-03-23 01:06:00,4022,"Another vote for the canoe with a trolling motor.  That's what I started with.  But one thing I might add.  I knew I was going to get a larger boat in a future, so I got a little bigger trolling motor.  That way when I bought my 14' tinner, I could pull the trolling motor off the canoe, and use it on the tinner."
564835,splashhopper,2011-03-23 01:40:00,2931,"I got my 38lb thrust Motor Guide trolling motor, new long cycle battery and 2 cycle battery charger for $140.00 on Kijiji  It pulls my 12 foot tinnie, with my BIG friend Dutchy, in it all weekend as well."
