553929,buckhorn250,2011-02-21 12:53:00,85,Was at the show yesterday and heard that SAIL is setting up a location this fall accross from BPS. Can anyone confirm? Would be nice to get some healthy competition going.
553953,kickingfrog,2011-02-21 13:44:00,8333,"No idea, but I was at the one in Ottawa this weekend. It would be nice to have another option in the gta."
553972,Armz,2011-02-21 14:44:00,2,Just found this article and it mentions two locations coming to the Toronto area. More competition is usually a great thing. http://www.ottawacit...3250/story.html
553977,Gregoire,2011-02-21 14:51:00,1397,"That is cool. I'd like to see a store open East of Toronto, but wonder what effect that would have on Gagnon's."
553978,muskymike,2011-02-21 14:54:00,772,"I wouldnt get too excited, anyone that has been in the SAIL in the Trainyards in Ottawa will know, its not that special. Although the competition would help with BPS, BPS's selection destroys Sail's selection. Just my opinion though."
553993,mercman,2011-02-21 15:32:00,7054,"I second you on that Mike.I live 5 minutes from Sail in Brossard Que, and i drive all the way to Montreal for Le Baron.Sail has the bare basics, lots of designer outdoors wear and camping stuff, but the fishing dept lacks choice for sure."
554010,Stoty,2011-02-21 16:30:00,2910,"Yes, there is a SAIL coming to Toronto (Vaughan) and Oshawa.  The one in Oshawa is apparently going to be beside the Walmart on Stevenson Rd, which is literally 2 mins from Gagnon's."
554401,hirk,2011-02-22 21:49:00,571," Stoty is right and yes near BPS as well.It will effect Gagnon's and my shop as well being 10 minutes away but Gagnon's has been around a long time with a loyal following and I think they and myself will be just fine,take care of your customer and they will take care of you."
554614,DMASSE,2011-02-23 13:30:00,420,  HIRK where is your shop.  I live in oshawa and wouldnt mind checking it out
554628,Roy,2011-02-23 14:00:00,13728,I don't think anyone has to worry about Sail. These are the same people who have no fishing items in their online catalogue in the winter.
554630,Stoty,2011-02-23 14:06:00,2910, He's in Courtice
554636,jedimaster,2011-02-23 14:14:00,3472,"For me selection is king, price is a very close second, custommer service is nice when you need it, but I won't pay more for not the exact thing I want, just cause someone is smiling. Personally BPS doesn't meet any of those the color selection of the lures I use I have to drive around or buy online, the sales at bps are good, if sail puts up a pricematch and has good sales and good customer service then bps may finally be forced to smarten up in customer service area. I was hoping gander mountain or cabelas would open up near the gta."
554690,anglerspro,2011-02-23 16:17:00,25,"As far as I'm concerned I keep my money in Canada and support local Canadian business as much as I can, it's better for all of us. Normally your small local tackle shops will provide you with better service and better advice on local fishing when you need it and you dont have to drive very far to get it. Try getting that at BPS..."
554694,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-23 16:26:00,4399," I hear you on that Graham, I have been meaning to drop into your shop and talk to you about a fly rod set up for Pike and Bass."
554789,anglerspro,2011-02-23 20:46:00,25,  I've got new fly rods coming in in March and what I don't have I can order for you. I'll be in most days until I start getting busy with guiding in April.
564900,nexstar,2011-03-23 03:27:00,63,"Passed by Chrislea today and saw a Sail Opening Soon sign.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=&daddr=&hl=en&geocode=&mra=mr&doflg=ptk&sll=43.793309,-79.541788&sspn=0.006474,0.01929&ie=UTF8&ll=43.794595,-79.541788&spn=0.006474,0.01929&z=16  good to see a new competitor as a consumer."
