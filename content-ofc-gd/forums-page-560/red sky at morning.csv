564952,lew,2011-03-23 11:22:00,12766,Beautiful sunrise over Clear Lake this morning ahead of the approaching snow their calling for.  
564954,Roy,2011-03-23 11:25:00,13728,"A beautiful sky indeed, Lew and to think, some folks never see that. Good morning."
564957,Spiel,2011-03-23 11:35:00,9065,Oh it's coming Lew. This was the scene outside my door 5 minutes ago.  
564959,lew,2011-03-23 11:39:00,12766,"Mornin Roy & Chris, I think I like my scenery better"
564960,Spiel,2011-03-23 11:43:00,9065,I do too Lew.
564962,bigugli,2011-03-23 12:08:00,6138,Skies here have been solid white since 3am. Just got off the road 15 minutes back. Not pretty.
564963,Jer,2011-03-23 12:11:00,1426,"Take heart Lew, the local forecast is only calling for 2 cm or less. The storm is skimming along just south of us here.  radar"
564965,Billy Bob,2011-03-23 12:19:00,5865,I don't know about any red sky this morning but all that white puke is back....  :wallbash:
564971,lew,2011-03-23 12:31:00,12766," That's good news Jer, this winter foolishness has gone on far too long"
564975,Harrison,2011-03-23 12:38:00,2202,"Nice veiw Lew, I am jealous of you, I'll pay my due, and one day live up by you. Tootalew.  Is it friday yet?"
564978,Moosebunk,2011-03-23 12:44:00,3970,Woke to this one morning in the fall of 2006.  Someone was watching over Joe and I later that day.   
565006,bigbuck,2011-03-23 14:12:00,2449,"I sure hope this is winter's last kick at the can. It's blowing and coming down fairly nicely in Oakville today. We got the call from Halton's School board this morning to tell us that buses are cancelled today but schools are open. Thanks for the info but the kids are in JK and SK and they don't go to school today. For the newbie boaters out there, please remember this saying:  ""Red sky at night, sailors take delight. Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning."""
565013,lew,2011-03-23 14:31:00,12766,"Incredible picture Drew, that makes the whole trip worthwhile right there !!"
565032,irishfield,2011-03-23 15:13:00,26272,Sunshine up here today (so far)... guess we drew the lucky card for once!
565037,lew,2011-03-23 15:20:00,12766,"Still dry over this way too Wayne, infact there's a few blue patches opening up....keeping fingers crossed"
565039,Tdel,2011-03-23 15:22:00,393,No sun shining now but no snow either. 
565040,irishfield,2011-03-23 15:25:00,26272,You must live on the gloomy side of town Tom !!
565051,Spiel,2011-03-23 15:51:00,9065,"Still snowing in Hamilton. Looks like about 6""s on the ground now."
565063,Garry2Rs,2011-03-23 16:37:00,1425,"Clear and bright in Yuma.   A little cool though, only 16C this morning, but it will reach 25C by noon. That's cool for this time of year."
565064,HTHM,2011-03-23 16:43:00,4082,"Oh, cry me a river....  Soon you will be up here with our temps in the teens wearing your winter parka as we walk around in our t-shirts."
565081,bigugli,2011-03-23 17:29:00,6138,Hail and freezing rain and snow all mixed together. perfect day for scrubbing out the oven. Maybe make a few lures and enjoy some of that elderberry brandy from last fall.
565088,Spiel,2011-03-23 17:52:00,9065," Piss off Garry.  I'm not gonna shovel the drive or the walks, hopefully you'll have to trudge through it when you arrive here, soon."
565231,Tdel,2011-03-23 22:10:00,393," That I do Wayne, but you must have decided to share. The sun is breaking through the dark grey clouds and still no snow. I hope I am not tempting fate. You know how 5 cm ends up being 15cm here."
