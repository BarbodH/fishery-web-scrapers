565116,Terry,2011-03-23 18:37:00,14456,it seems to be locked to at&t so I don't see how it would work here  if you had to install a simm card then it would work  unless I missed something  but I seem to remember you have internet access at your camp so you could make up your own to send it to your computer/smart phone

The GPS modem connection also allows you to change your game camera settings or check the battery status, even from your internet-capable cell phone or PDA.  Note: Wireless GPS Modem only available for use in the U.S.  Looks like it is proprietory to At&t with a 39.99 a month fee for the website usage. It appears it is a must unless you hack the modem to a new I.P.  That is the camera we use on the farm it takes great pictures and with the card I think it will do 1800 pictures. Maybe Joe will chime in or send him an P.M. T.J..  Art"
