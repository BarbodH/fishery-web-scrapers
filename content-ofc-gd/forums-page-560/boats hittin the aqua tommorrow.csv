563742,RoyF,2011-03-20 17:25:00,12,"I have no boat, but I have been out fishing in Ottawa.... The water is running to fast for anything by the locks. I went to bait island, not good there, then went to black rapids (i think it is called) and the water is too fast due to the dam, and then drove to Kars Ont. but the ice is still on that part of the Rideau river. So nothing caught yet this year. Maybe next week it might be a little different?  Roy"

Started rebuilding the transom today, but there's still a lot of ice in front of my place and the Guindon park launch isn't ice free yet...  Mike, did you launch at the RCAF?  Haven't wet a line since my trailer issues last fall so I've got the itch real bad."
563810,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 20:52:00,3761," x2 for me lol, why sit and cry when you can get out shore fishing at the very least"
564001,fishrking,2011-03-21 13:26:00,24,Bay's still iced up but I'm jonsing to drop it in ... first chance I get!
564423,mike rousseau,2011-03-22 06:02:00,4661,   Yeah...RCAF... I busted the remaining ice with my truck and managed to get my boat in... There isn't much ice flowing in Cornwall but I'd be very careful if you head east...
