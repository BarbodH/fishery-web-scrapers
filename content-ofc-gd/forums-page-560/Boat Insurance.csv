564074,Raf,2011-03-21 16:52:00,3495,I am going with a standalone marine insurance policy as opposed to putting it on house insurance.  Who are you with and would you recommend?
564076,bigbuck,2011-03-21 16:55:00,2449,"Good plan, you are better off going with a standalone policy. Call your local insurance brokers and see what they have to offer. You have to compare policies to see what is and what is not covered and the limits."
564077,Raf,2011-03-21 16:58:00,3495,"I tried my broker.  Maybe I should be looking for a new one; his idea of boat insurance it to put it under home.  When I mentioned I did not want to do that, I rec'vd a blank stare.  He does get me a great deal on auto ins though."
564078,tonyb,2011-03-21 17:00:00,1637,"  Marine Expert  Best prices I could find for the coverage I needed.  Also, they were able to modify the layup for me to suit the open water season here in S. Ont.  Endorsement No. XXVI - SPECIAL ENDORSEMENT   Lay up period is amended to read Dec 31st to April 1st "
564085,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-21 17:05:00,10439,When I lived in Ontario I had my boat insurance through Meadowvales Insurance Brokers in Meadowvale. The company they had me with was great and my boat was insured for full replacement cost for about $300/year.
564088,bigbuck,2011-03-21 17:07:00,2449,"Is your insurance broker with allstate or state farm?? If so, that's all he has to offer. Keeping it separate is smart because if you have a claim on your boat insurance, only your boat insurance goes up, not everything else (house, car, etc...) Call around, spend a bit of time doing it."
564094,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 17:30:00,5865,Insurance is BEST purchase when dealing straight with the company in question and not using a middle man (broker). But if you like to put a big smile on a insurance broker/agent then go for it...
564106,steelhedrmatt,2011-03-21 17:57:00,278,I'll second Marine Experts.  Best coverage out there i think.
564200,POLLIWOGG,2011-03-21 21:32:00,835,"CPS has a policy available for their members, if you happen to be a member. Discounted for each coarse you finish."

564313,vinnimon,2011-03-22 00:58:00,2593,"Ive had my policy seperate from the house, and car. Fully insured to the a tee all year long. With little ones running around, you never know. And I insured it with the same place I insure everything. Its easier and they know me there."
564432,Crazy Ivan,2011-03-22 10:17:00,184,"I'm with Aviva Canada/NautiMax. They allowed me to shorten my lay-up time (Nov 30 to April 1) without an increase in my premium. It was Nov 1 to Apr 30. Anyone boating in Dec. or March, are you paying alot more to run the boat then?"
564440,bubbles,2011-03-22 11:38:00,591,"State Farm is great, reasonable and no complaints."
564442,taper,2011-03-22 11:48:00,611,I recommend finding a policy that insures all year long.
564444,ecmilley,2011-03-22 11:58:00,2163,I have my ranger insured under my home policy extra $120 a year
564447,BITEME,2011-03-22 12:27:00,1968,Yeah same under the house policy 120.00 a year
564483,tonyb,2011-03-22 13:57:00,1637,  My insurance would essentially double in order to have coverage from Dec 31-Apr 1.  I'm ice fishing during the layup period anyway so it's not worth the added cost to me.
