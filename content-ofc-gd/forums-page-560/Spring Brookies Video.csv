564371,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-22 02:26:00,0,With the warm weather I decided to bring my video camera out on a few brookie trips in the last week.  I made a video of the bit of footage I took.  Some of it's pretty goofy.  Hope you enjoy! Spring Specks

564539,solopaddler,2011-03-22 16:23:00,8605,"On a side note based on the title I was expecting something from last year. Open water in a canoe with the birds chirping and the sun shining.  I guess ""spring"" in the Soo means anything above minus 10."
564575,Moosebunk,2011-03-22 17:13:00,3970,Gem of a vid report.  What a great day of specks.
