564645,skinny,2011-03-22 20:20:00,442,when i was younger i use to like watching this movie .I cn't remeber the name and not sure if I will ever find it but here goes what I remember. It's about a boy that leaves home (I think) and he goes and lives in the woods. hefinds a big hollowed out tree to live in . he finds a raccoon and keeps as a pet/friend. he lives off the land and does meet a few people while out there. I think he gets snowed in in a storm too. He eventually returns to his real home.  any help to find it would be nice I would like my kids to watch it

564655,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-22 20:34:00,0,"lemme know if you do online or something.  i've never actually seen the movie, just read the book.  i've never been able to find the film."
564658,ckrb2007,2011-03-22 20:39:00,449,"  As another member said it's called ""My Side of the Mountain"" I love this movie!!  I did have a copy that I downloaded of a torrent site but it wasn't that good. It was good to watch with my kids. Kinda reminded me of myself when I was younger.....heading out to the woods, making a shelter, cooking hot dogs........etc.  Hope you find it."
