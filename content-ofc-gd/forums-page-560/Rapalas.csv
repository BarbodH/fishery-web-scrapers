564210,Mike01,2011-03-21 21:42:00,378,I went to the store in North Bay this aft.  Looked like it had picked clean.  still picked up a few things though
564275,fisher12,2011-03-22 00:09:00,81,"Nothing going on at the one in heartland ,Mississauga either. lol"
564323,GBW,2011-03-22 01:05:00,8460,"see, I hide them... Whitby North store doesn't have any Rap's but it does have a bunch of Storm products."
564328,BillM,2011-03-22 01:08:00,17367,"Barrie South has a table full of crap, lol."
564339,ckrb2007,2011-03-22 01:26:00,449,"Bill, Yep...nothing but a small table full of CRAP at the south end Barrie store........but they do have rakes on sale! hahahaha"
564451,Harrison,2011-03-22 12:38:00,2202, In the flyer for the Bowmanville store they had 40% off fishnig items.  I was there first thing and saved 50 cents on a few lindy rigs.  Not much else unless you want cheap combos.  Hopefully when they build the new store in Bowmanville they'll have a blow out... here's hoping anyways.
564455,GBW,2011-03-22 12:50:00,8460,"I was just kidding, hinting that I put them in my tackle bag...  I didn't hit up the South store."
564572,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-22 17:05:00,2690,Checked one of the stores in Kitchener on my lunch...diddly-squat...no surprise.
564584,Terry,2011-03-22 17:38:00,14456,no deals at Bradford CTC  had a sticker the said yellow tagged items on sale  but no yellow tags and no bare spots ..so no deals
563683,Roy,2011-03-20 15:12:00,13728,"Was at the CTC here in Boucherville this morning for a coupla boxes of mason jars. Sauntered over to the fishing stuff for a look see...I don't usually buy tackle at CTC BUT, there's a huge bin there with tons of Rapalas, taildancers, originals, countdowns,husky jerks, glass raps, shad raps and almost every other kind in many flavours. Checked out the price on the scanner and lo and behold, they are at 50%. That's a good deal. Check out your local CTCs if you're interested. Mercman, if you're reading this, take a run over and scoop some.  ps, Gas is 127.4 here this morning."
563687,danbouck,2011-03-20 15:19:00,4380,"maybe i'll take a wander over this morning, thanks for the heads up"
563691,GBW,2011-03-20 15:30:00,8460,"all the stores are going to a new look so the ""old faithful"" lures are on clearance.  at least the Whitby ones are doing it too."
563693,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 15:34:00,3761,"Anybody checked out Lindsay CDN Tire? I'll be there this week to see for myself, 50% is a good deal"
563694,Chance,2011-03-20 15:41:00,420,"Been throwing Rapalas for years,great lures,thanks for the head up Roy !!"

563722,Handlebarz,2011-03-20 16:52:00,3790,I am sure that our CTC has marked them up 100% before they take that 50% off I hope you guys get some good deals on them our store sucks.
563736,darsky,2011-03-20 17:11:00,586,Roy-orange j-9 or j-11 is a great trolling lure on early season lakers. Perch is good too-naturally. Clip on a few splitshots to get it down 5-10 ft. This rig catches a few for me every year.
563739,houski,2011-03-20 17:18:00,61,"Hey Mike, let me know if that is indeed the case! With spring pike just around the corner, I could sure stock up!"
563749,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 17:33:00,3761, Will do!

563824,ctdd2006,2011-03-20 21:26:00,531,just got back from my store.....picked up 5 shad raps and 4 Storm chugs and a couple others for 36bux!!!???  MIster twister tails cheap too!  I had to ask the kid in the store to point out the deals though.  I'm going back tomorrow hoping they restock the shelves as the discounted lures weren't in a bin but mixed with all the others.  Happy hunting.
563831,d_paluch,2011-03-20 21:36:00,343,CTC in Oakville on Kerr st. has a bunch of rapala cranks on clearance...20-60% off. All of the fishing lures on the sliding racks are on clearance.  I wish we had the 50% off all of them.
563916,Radnine,2011-03-21 01:05:00,1538,"Last week our store in Caledonia had CD-9 Countdown Rapala (in fire-minnow pattern) on for $5.00!! I grabbed the last two they had and checked out the CT on Upper James where their CD-9's had the the red clearance tag on the hook, but were priced at $8 and change!! I also picked up a wood handle/leather sheath Rapala knife for $19.00. It always pays to check the fishing isle at CT, regardless of your politics. Jim"
563938,newboykool,2011-03-21 02:05:00,81,anyone know any store that has the deal near mississauga?
564097,ADB,2011-03-21 17:36:00,444,No hard baits on sale at the CTC in Guelph on Stone Road.  I should be checking one out back home in Richmond Hill tonight.
564102,GBW,2011-03-21 17:39:00,8460,not going to find any if I beat you to it...
564117,Roy,2011-03-21 18:21:00,13728,"HA! Hey Sinclair, that's a sneaky move.I thought you told me you'd be there at 5:15!"
564135,I'mHooked,2011-03-21 18:48:00,525,Nothing going on at Burlington Mall CTC. Waterdown only had about 4 that were on sale and all sold out.
564181,Nipfisher,2011-03-21 20:58:00,2449,"Went to the C.T. store in North Bay today and at the back of one of the rows there is a small section of clearance baits. I bought 2 Husky Jerks (HJ-14 and DHJ-13) and some Mr.Twister grubs that look like leaches. total was $14.21 and I saved about $12.60! Lots of selection on the smaller rappalas but I'm not much of a bass guy. There was also some Trigger X, lots of Mr. Twister, and various baits suich as Little Cleos and some Mepps Spinners."
564202,ADB,2011-03-21 21:33:00,444,"If anybody outside of the GTA finds x-raps on sale and in large quantities, let me know.  Depending on how many you can get your hands on, I can make it worth your while to pick them up for me."
564203,GBW,2011-03-21 21:34:00,8460,"I wonder if he found where I moved them to... lucky me, my train rolls in right at 5..."
