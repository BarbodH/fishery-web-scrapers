562884,Fisherpete,2011-03-18 02:12:00,1814,"It's time to retire the trusty Humminbird 525 to ice fishing duty only and upgrade the boat to something a bit nicer...  I have been drooling over the Lowrance Elite 5 series, but for 2/3 the price, I can get the Lowrance Mark 5x DSI series  Same power (500W RMS, 4000W PTP) Same down scan imaging Elite series is Colour, Mark series is B&W  Here are the different price points (@ LeBaron)  Elite 5 DSI Gold (downscan imaging, colour, GPS, includes Navionics gold chip) $722 Elite 5 DSI-x (downscan imaging, colour) no GPS $560 Elite 5 Gold (colour, GPS) no downscan imaging, no chip $548 Elite 5x (color)$456 Mark 5x DSI (downscan imaging, B&W) $299  The difficulty in choice is that I would really like to have the GPS feature to help fine tune trolling speed... I have a hand held GPS already, but it would be nice to have everything ion one package.  Anyone have one of these units? How has it been?"
562889,Fang,2011-03-18 02:28:00,1330,"Had a few over the years and last year I picked up my first colour. Would now never fish without it. With the higher wattage (mines a 4000 HB)there is just no comparison with seeing whats down there but in color.  Spend the money and get a colour unit, you'll never regret it"
562895,Nipfisher,2011-03-18 02:43:00,2449,Why not the HDS series from Lowrance? I have the 5 but if I did it again I'd go bigger.
562968,Raf,2011-03-18 13:26:00,3495,the DSI units are meant to compliment a regular sonar.  don't get the DSI if it is your only sonar.  you won't see zhit capt.
564136,Fisherpete,2011-03-21 18:52:00,1814,"Hey Raf, you mean the Elite units do not have a 'normal' fishfinding mode, only the downscan mode? If that is true, wow, thanks! That info changes everything...  Starting to lean towards the Elite 5 gold (non DSI) @ $548. Colour, GPS, 4000w/500w. Throw a Kawarthas chip in there and it should be a sweet setup..."
564142,Raf,2011-03-21 19:01:00,3495,That's correct Pete.  The DSI units do not come with a regular transducer/regular fish finder mode.  The 'Gold' package should come with a Chip -- I bought mine at the Fishing Show and got it with a Great Lakes chip which would cover the Kawarthas.
564144,Fang,2011-03-21 19:02:00,1330,"Rafs right, although the DI from what I know is supposed to be the ""NEW"" technology fish finder. My gut tells me let everyone else try it and they'll work the bugs out until it's proven  HD5 5 or HB597  will cover everything you need and then some!"
564196,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 21:23:00,5865,I don't have a DSI unit but rather a LMS 520c unit...but with everything I have seen and read....I would rather have a DSI unit on my boat as it's down-looking sonar imaging seem much better than conventional flat imaging I now have.....down-looking sonar imaging is more camera/picture like and much easier to read and interpret then old 2D imaging IMHO....why would you not what the DSI technology in a sonar unit ? ? ?  Here's more info right from Lowrance.... http://www.lowrance.com/Products/Marine/Mark-Elite-Series/Elite-5-DSI-Gold/
564348,archie_james_c,2011-03-22 01:33:00,618,"Go with an HDS 5. I know it's not one of your picks but look at it this way...  Colour 5"" screen Amazing standard sonar Great GPS with half decent preloaded maps Abilty to add structure scan later Ability to add more HDS's later!"
564667,Raf,2011-03-22 20:49:00,3495,"Billy Bob, I think you'd change your mind if you look at this thread: http://www.thehulltruth.com/marine-electronics-forum/317662-lowrance-dsi-first-impressions.html  same spot:  DSI   Traditional   the fish on the DSI unit is a barely noticeable speck and the traditional unit tells me much more about what's down there."
564899,archie_james_c,2011-03-23 03:22:00,618,"  If I'm not mistaken, wasnt the LSS made to be used in conjunction with conventional sonar? With my limited expreience using other HDS's and LSS last season I found that they work together. Some things the LSS (DSI) missed the traditional sonar shows. Or they both show it but one or the other helps clarify the object being marked, etc....?"
565052,Raf,2011-03-23 15:58:00,3495,"yes, I mentioned that earlier in this thread"
