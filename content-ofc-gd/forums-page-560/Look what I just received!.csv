If you were dieing to get the Neon Lime version of this line like I was then check for ebay user ""shoreoutletstore"". Shipping may very on location but it was dirt cheap to Kingston, Ontario and only took a week to receive it. This stuff is supper round in diameter and feel relatively smooth as far as braids come. Time to go spool this on my new Shimano Caenan. Cant wait till I can hit the water!   Just spooled it up:  I love Neon Green, its my fave colour, so this to me looks AMAZING!"
565175,Terry,2011-03-23 20:18:00,14456,I couldn't find that store on ebay

565254,umKthxbye,2011-03-23 22:56:00,247, Your very welcomed.
565255,Cudz,2011-03-23 22:57:00,2652,They sell it at Walmart here in Barrie (not the lime).  It is $19.99.  How much did you pay?  Link does not work
565260,Terry,2011-03-23 22:59:00,14456,I think it's 34 for 300 yards
565264,umKthxbye,2011-03-23 23:09:00,247,yeah $34US +2.59 shipping. This is for 50LB 300yards. And no Canada store has it in Neon Lime yet that I know of. Only in the moss green.
565271,umKthxbye,2011-03-23 23:38:00,247,"Oh damn, they removed it. I wonder why that is. It was such a good buy too. The other guy selling it charges $20+ for shipping.   Just checked on my ebay account and the guy is no longer registered with ebay. That sucks."
