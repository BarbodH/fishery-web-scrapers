564160,twofish,2011-03-21 19:44:00,6,if it's linked to the house it needs foundation (building code). if it's detached slab on grade. the best bang for the buck is future steel buildings sell offs look em up on the web they have packages starting from 4 grand to 50 grand.like the quansit hut they are doit yourself bolt together packages. a 24x 30 garage start to finish is around 30 grand depending on finishes http://futuresteel.com/steel-deals/canadian-clearance-buildings.html
564399,ch312,2011-03-22 03:32:00,1590, i've been in that location 10 times or so in the last 3 years.
564415,dhickey,2011-03-22 04:20:00,1038,ya. but im going to bed now. allot of good advice here/just need to sort it out.? mabey we can talk 2moro. salty.
564446,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-22 12:27:00,2050,"Hey guys!  all very appreciated awesome advice but I think I've opted against this for now.  I just got the quote to waterproof my basement! lol   :o  Thanks again for being so helpful with this kind of stuff!  Cheers, Ryan"
564458,Dara,2011-03-22 13:00:00,3052,"Yeah...your WIFE decided you were opting against it.  You are best to stay away from those quonset huts anyway. They aren't built for any type of snow load and collapse around here alll the time.  Pita to insulate, damp...just not a good building except for cheap cold storage"
564743,express168,2011-03-22 23:43:00,327,"  If you are ever in again ask for me, I may be there or on the road but I will see what I can do for you. Who are you working for CH312, you can PM me on that rather than hijacking the thread. Sorry to hear about having to waterproof the basement Ryan, feel free to PM me if you need any info after all having been in the foundation business for a while I have a bit of experience in the waterproofing end as well. It isn't rocket science but takes alot of elbow grease!"
563333,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 13:25:00,2050,"I have an opportunity to get a FREE 30 x 40 steel barn style garage... It'll need a front wall and back wall, a slab, and a garage door.  What I want to figure out is if it's going to save me money or if I should just wait and build a regular garage some day.  Rough 30 x 40 slab price?  Rough price for a standard 30 x 40 garage?  I live in the middle of nowhere so I can't just call a local contractor and most of the contractors I looked up in the citybare closed today."
563341,Bunker,2011-03-19 14:17:00,29,"this is just off The top of my head and is just an estimate...     the price I was qoute for a while a go for a job was $150.00/meter of concrete 3'x3'x4""..I can't remember if it was 4"" or 6"" .... Trucks I think can hold 11 yds of concrete.   pouring a slab  is not that hard you just have to make sure you put your rebar and steel mesh in. doing some research on the net will come up with alot of slab type foundations.  The price I gave you is just an estimate from a local concrete guy from around my neck of the woods.   I hope this helps: a little"
563346,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 14:24:00,2050, Hey bunker thanks!  I'm fishing around online for info as well.... I used to help poor pool decks and shed slabs as a summer job so I think I can handle it as well but no idea what the concrete costs.... So thanks for your input.
563352,TDunn,2011-03-19 14:50:00,680,"Its 200/yard up here. my guess would be 12-15 yards is what you would need. A 24x24 - with pad, framed, siding, soffit, facia,window, man door and garage door is usally around $14,000.    I'd like to see pics of that mercer guy pouring some concrete with ya!"
563355,cwpowell,2011-03-19 15:00:00,265,Mercers not Italian though?
563359,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 15:10:00,2050,Hey brother... That's a cubic yard right? And you figure to be safe it'd take at least 15 yards for a 30 x 40 slab?
563363,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 15:29:00,2050, Haha just noticed that comment... He's Irish... How's the Irish when it comes to cement work?
563364,ch312,2011-03-19 15:30:00,1590,"ummmm...we're in canada folks. when you order concrete around here you're asking for cubic meters, not yards  it's not as simple as pouring a slab and building your garage on it. you need to look at the soil/base in your area, what's going to be in your shop (weight), and even style of garage. a roof that size will hold a lot of snow/weight in the winter and you're slab needs to be able to support it. you don't want to put all this money into the garage just to have problems 5 years from now.  i highly doubt you'll get away with pouring a simple slab on grade. at the very least you'll be looking at a monolithic slab (google it). the proper way would involve pouring footings and then a 4ft frost wall to properly support the structure and avoid heaving.  slab = 14m monolithic = 18m footings and frost walls = 26m ""A"" gravel = 20 yards or so  for 32mpa with air you're probably looking at $160-$180/meter A gravel is around $30/yard (most don't use metric) wire mesh is $8-9 per 4x8 sheet 10m rebar is $9-11 per 20ft length  take the cost of materials and multiply it by 2.5 to get a rough idea of how much a contractor will charge you for the concrete."
563366,TDunn,2011-03-19 15:42:00,680,"  Ya I would think Ryan and yes thats a cubic yard. I couldnt tell you forsure but there is a math equation that will tell you I think. My boss cheats and uses a construction calculator for that. Concrete work is fairly easy. Just makesure your forms are square and level before you pour. Laser levels come in handy for this. Rebar the outside(footing) and fill the middle with mesh if you don't want to rebar the entire pad.  After your done pouring is when the babysitting begins. There is also an accelerator you can put in the concrete that helps speed up the process of hardening. If you have no experience finishing the pad you might want some help for someone who has but you did say you finished pool pads. I'm not sure if your looking for a brushed look or a smooth, glossy floor."
563370,TDunn,2011-03-19 15:43:00,680,My bad ch312....metres....
563375,ch312,2011-03-19 16:25:00,1590,"i highly recommend a polished finish on your slab to make cleanup and sweeping MUCH easier. that smooth floor will also make it much easier to wheel things around. you'd be surprised by how smooth and shiny of a floor you could have.  i know the OP has experience with shed slabs and pool decks, but something this size is a totally different job that's best left to the pro's."
563378,TDunn,2011-03-19 16:34:00,680,  ^^^^^Agreed! Did slabs for 5 years and dont miss it!
563400,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 18:12:00,2050,Hey guys thanks for all the awesome info!  I completely forgot that my wifes cousin does this for a living!   I know he'd be glad to help me out so no worries on that front.  But the advice here is great anyways because that dude is basking in the sun in florida right now for the march break! I'm going to put some thought into this...  Thanks again
563408,Rattletrap2,2011-03-19 18:28:00,1652,"Hey Ryan, I would love to hear how this project pans out as you go along. It is something I will be looking at down the road and would like to know more about your experiences.  Keep us up to date!  Thanks"
563414,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-19 18:46:00,2050," I'll keep you posted for sure!  I have some basement renos going on right now otherwise it'd be a no brainer.  And having a garage is a luxury, not a necessity for me.  The only advantage of doing it now is that I can do it for a discounted price and it'd increase the value of my property.  Living out in the county means people who want to buy your house also want a garage.  It's a bit of a pipe dream but could become a reality if all the stars align.  This is what has been offered to me but half that size.  Like I said, it needs a front a back and a slab/footing.    Cheers, Ryan"
563423,Entropy,2011-03-19 19:27:00,747,"Last year I put up an 18 x 24 ft with loft, and am at about $18000 now, and just need to put a chimney in and insulate.  Included in that are slab, top quality 9x7 garage door, man door, 3 4x4 windows, siding, 30 year fiberglass shingles and 100% ice and water sheild, sofit and facia, as well as a set of good stairs that go up to the loft, oh and all wired up too.  The slab cost was $5500 with 12"" around the outside, 6"" throughout the rest, and lots of mesh and rebar, wanted to over do it a bit just to be sure.  My brother inlaw put up a hut like the one you are looking at, and it was a big pain in the but, leaks, is cold, and is like being in a big culvert.  I would build with wood again anyday, in a traditional sense.  Entropy"
563424,Bill Shearer,2011-03-19 19:36:00,456," Good wisdom, and experience in this post! Leave the steel for the farm implement shed, IMO"
563425,irishfield,2011-03-19 19:45:00,26272,"Like Entropy... Free isn't always the cheapest route Ryan and if it's not comfortable you'll never use it. I look at quansuts as an eye sore and of no significant increase to a properties value.  I think I have $45k in my 30 x 60.. probably cost you $55k these days to build.  8 course block foundation, 2 x 6 walls with 10 foot ceiling, 60 ' span truss roof (so snow doesn't come down in front of doors) 5 - 9 x 9 Garaga insulated doors (don't go any smaller than that!), 6 inch cement slab, R52 ceilng/ R20 walls, Galvinized ceiling.. drywall'd walls. 6kw heater barely works to keep it 52F all winter... small parlor stove from my Gramma's on Glamour Lake keeps it toasty with about 8 logs / full work day.  man.. it's been a long time since it looked that clean! lol   "
563440,danbouck,2011-03-19 20:36:00,4380,Just start one from scratch and deliver the free one to my cottage!
563497,Entropy,2011-03-19 23:33:00,747,"Here is a not so good pic, I have better on another card.  The $5500 for the pad was installed, smooth surface for ease of clean up.  All the rest I did myself, it was the biggest I was allowed to build on my lot. Oh, I also bought and paid for a garage door company for the door and instal, opener included.  All material were locally bought at family owned bus', and windows and man door are from Canada Windows and Doors.  Bought a decent wood stove and 17 ft of chimney, just need to put if up and get it cert.  Building inspector in my area was great, told me to connect it to the house some how, and I could build it as big as I want.  I think you could put the shell up for about $14000, floor included.  It's all the extra that kills you, like wanting a roof that would not leak in 20 years, but sill wanting shingles, electrical fixtures, and wire, nice energy start windows (better than what is in my house).  Good luck."
563500,Entropy,2011-03-19 23:45:00,747,"pic will not work, Error This file was too big to upload"
563524,express168,2011-03-20 00:38:00,327,"I would check with the local building department because CH312  was correct,garages normally would require at least a 4 foot frost wall be built for the foundation, just a slab is normally not adequate for a garage like it is for a shed. Have done plenty of foundation walls in Hamilton and the GTA for garages when working for the forming company. The Ready Mix companies will be able to help you with the proper concrete required and amounts if given the dimensions and slab depths, and up here it is cubic meters not cubic yards. Get in touch with me if you need any densifiers, epoxy floor coatings or trench drains for the shop, I now work for construction materials supply company and can help you with any things you might want to add. Best of luck with the job."
563767,ch312,2011-03-20 18:09:00,1590,"express, where abouts do you work? we use a few different places in hamilton for the majority of our supplies and may have met before..."
563786,express168,2011-03-20 18:59:00,327," I am the Outside Rep for the Hamilton Location of Form and Build Supply. If you work in concrete in the area there is a good chance you have been in, if not come by sometime and ask for Jerry. We are on Lancing Drive off of Nebo Road."
564075,mpt,2011-03-21 16:53:00,158,Couldn't you just pour concrete for footins and gravel the rest of the floor? If cost is the issue that would be the way to go.
