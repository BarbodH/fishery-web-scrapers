564623,Terry,2011-03-22 19:28:00,14456,"I wondered why I didn't seem to know the movie I thought I had seen every B movie that was ever made    but that explains it, I have not seen every C movie or is it a D"
564340,jedimaster,2011-03-22 01:26:00,3472,"Ok so I remember a scene from a movie I would think its at least pre 95's I seem to feel like its from the mid 80's or possibly earlier. The scene I recall is where a small group of people find something liek a big canister or something and they think its alien, so they sit on it and setup to take a picture of a video or something, and one of the guys has an alien go through his space suit and explode his head inside the space suit.  Now I thought this was from Alien, but I don't think it is. Does anyone know what this is from? Another person from work remembers this scen but couldn't place the movie either."
564344,cram,2011-03-22 01:29:00,1733," If its in the arctic, could be The Thing.  It was kind of similar."
564345,Daplumma,2011-03-22 01:30:00,1961,"I'm guessing this is a non fishing thread.My favorite kind ,sorry I cant help you out here but on some level I remember this also. Joe"
564347,irishfield,2011-03-22 01:32:00,26272,I'm trying to remember if acid was a big thing in the 80's or 90's to help you nail down the year!!
564353,mercman,2011-03-22 01:45:00,7054,"I wish i could help, but most of the 80's where a booze blur for me But i seem to remember The Thing has such a scene in it."
564370,jedimaster,2011-03-22 02:24:00,3472,"Leviathan, Deep star six, I can't remember now.... Maybe the thing, I can't remember that one."
564386,Joey,2011-03-22 02:53:00,9122,"I'm not sure they have a space suit on in The Thing where his head blows up!  I've been trying to search it for you with no success.  Maybe it'll come to me, but so far no luck, sorry.  Joey"
564390,Pikeslayer,2011-03-22 03:00:00,1443, That would of definitely been late 70's to early 80's. Just sayin
564403,camillj,2011-03-22 03:38:00,1988,Is this it ?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevQS4qgE_Q
564406,Skud,2011-03-22 03:43:00,739,It wasn't a comedy like Evolution was it? A bug got in the one guys suit but I don't remember an exploding head.  There was also 'MARS' with Val Kilmer where there was bugs that also got in peoples suit and into their bodies and fire made them explode.
564418,adempsey,2011-03-22 04:28:00,1498,You sure it's not Alien?  I recall that they were taking pictures when they find the crashed ship on the planet and the egg hatches and goes through his helmet.
564464,jedimaster,2011-03-22 13:05:00,3472,I though it was alien. But others at work said no way. I am gonna rewatch all the aliens to make sure for myself. Do you remember where in the movie the picture egg scene is?
564470,mbosh1980,2011-03-22 13:17:00,349,"Alien, the thing that comes out of the egg grabs on right near the beginning of the movie...his head doesnt explode, but the baby alien bursts out of his chest partway through at the dinner table. This is going to bug me all day, because I'm pretty sure I've seen the movie too..."
564491,umKthxbye,2011-03-22 14:21:00,247,"I can 100% tell you its not aliens. Just watched them all a while back and I'm alien, pretator"
564495,umKthxbye,2011-03-22 14:25:00,247,"I can 100% tell you its not aliens. Just watched them all a while back and I'm alien, predator and alien versus predator freak. The face sucker doesn't come out from under the guys suit. It launches at his helmet when the guy looks down into the egg and melts threw the glass and attaches to his face. They also come out of the chest not the face or head.  Sorry for double post. iPhone did that by itself :S"
564499,Roy,2011-03-22 14:47:00,13728,Mutiny on the Bounty perhaps?
564506,mercman,2011-03-22 15:02:00,7054,  RRRRRRR BILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
564533,adempsey,2011-03-22 16:07:00,1498,"Ya, I was referring to the start of Alien where the egg laying thing attaches to his face when they are exploring the crashed ship.  Not the chest scene later on in the movie.  The scene I am thinkin of is at 0:06 in this clip:"
564538,Governator,2011-03-22 16:18:00,879,It's called Outland with Sean COnnery - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082869/  There is a scene where they are being chased and the guy goes to take his helmet off too early and his head blows up from decompression.  Pretty certain that's the one you're talking about.
564542,mbosh1980,2011-03-22 16:27:00,349,Scanners has a blowed up head...nothing to do with aliens or space suits though.
564608,jedimaster,2011-03-22 18:32:00,3472,Thats not the scene I am thinking of fishland. I'll look into Outland... The search goes on....
564611,Roy,2011-03-22 18:45:00,13728,Could it have been MIB?
564612,jedimaster,2011-03-22 18:51:00,3472,No thats way too new. This is for sure 80's or 70's maybe early 90's and thats a big maybe. Looked into outland its not that.
564614,ADB,2011-03-22 18:54:00,444,Maybe you were abducted by aliens and you're finally remembering.
564617,jedimaster,2011-03-22 19:06:00,3472,"OMG I THINK I FOUND IT..... Here is a clip from a review....  ""If you find a weird container from outer space with some monster in it, of course you sit on it and have your friend take a picture!""   The movie is called Creature. from 1985.... Now how am I gonna find this movie..."
