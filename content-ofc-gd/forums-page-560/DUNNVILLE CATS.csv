Not a bite using worms. Heavy sinkers kept our bait anchored, but the lines were catching a lot of weeds. Hopefully a week or 2 things will settle down."

564986,Live2fish85,2011-03-23 13:05:00,1633,I had the same results as foggy I was out last weekend for cats in that area and nothing I would wait another week and you should get some better luck and the water will be lower hopefully.
