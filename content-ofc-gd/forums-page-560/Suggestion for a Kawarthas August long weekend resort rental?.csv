555324,saspirilli,2011-02-25 05:29:00,27,Hello to all on this very informative board!  I've been digging through the incredible number of websites for Kawartha Lakes resorts seeking a 3 - 4 bedroom cottage weekend rental for the 2011 August long weekend (actually falls on July 30th this year). We'll also look to rent three boats.  We've a group of 6 guys and can only spare a weekend (sadly) and the majority of resorts seem to only accept weekly bookings mid-summer (understandably). We've done Rice many times in the past and had an even better time on Buckhorn last year.  There's so much knowledge on this forum I thought I'd ask to see if anyone had any suggestions. We're very much open to any lake in the area.  Thanks in advance for any advice!
555330,adempsey,2011-02-25 07:47:00,1498,"It's common for most places to rent only for a week in the summer.  However, I often managed to book weekends only, but usually it's somewhat last minute.  You could try somewhere on Pigeon Lake or Jack Lake.  I've stayed at all these places and they were fine for a fishing weekender.  http://www.pigeonlakeresort.com/ http://www.campfisherman.com/ http://www.jackslakelodge.com/  There are a lot of other resorts on Pigeon/Chemong/Buckhorn to try.  I believe Jack Lake only has the one.  I am not sure about a 3-4 bed cottage either.  Although I haven't stayed here, this place on Kasshabog and this place on Dalrymple might be worth a look too.  Best of luck!"
555342,Billy Bob,2011-02-25 13:01:00,5865,MANY American Plan resorts will rent by the day/weekend/week...also have you considered renting a houseboat instead...did that twice on the Kawarthans.....LOTS of FUN...
555346,jediangler,2011-02-25 13:15:00,1923,There is also Miller's Timber Sands on Jack's lake. Really nice people and great rental boats.  http://www.millerstimbersands.com/
555383,adempsey,2011-02-25 15:50:00,1498," Ok, I was confused.  We actually stayed at Miller's Timber Sands.  For some reason I thought it was Jack's Lake Lodge."
555394,linweir,2011-02-25 16:20:00,202,I think Big Cliff still runs Long Beach Resort. Give him a shot. There are alot of nice of OFC'ers around here.
555410,saspirilli,2011-02-25 17:11:00,27,"Awesome - very much appreciate the leads! I have to admit that we may lean toward some of the smaller lakes as Rice (while great) tends to get packed.  Again, thanks for the sharing."

564515,saspirilli,2011-03-22 15:34:00,27,Thanks again for all of the great tips. We ended up confirming a long weekend on Jack Lake at Jack's Lake Lodge.  Very much looking forward to the trip.
564521,adempsey,2011-03-22 15:46:00,1498," Great!  I really like Jack Lake and hope to get back there this season.  Here is a nice map of the lake you can view online (or order): http://www.trakmaps.com/PrintedMapDetails.aspx?PM=a183e5f7-f0c5-4ddc-98d4-a437c74765ff  I believe that Jack's Lake Lodge is on Brooks Bay.  We fished in front of there quite a bit and there are some nice weed beds there where we caught bass and musky.  We also landed some 26"" walleye fishing around that small island at the south end of the bay.  The bay south of Redmond Bay where the map says Jack Lake also had a nice weed bed.  We caught boatloads of perch there as well.  Looking forward to hearing how your trip went.  Cheers!"
