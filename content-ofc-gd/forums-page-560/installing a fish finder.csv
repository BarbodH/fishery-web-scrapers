564856,Terry,2011-03-23 01:54:00,14456,yeah it is real simple
564860,skeeter,2011-03-23 01:59:00,1907,"Like Terry said, piece of cake ! Here's a tip to make it easier, when you pull the old lines out of the boat tie a piece of string onto the ends before you pull the lines out. When you run the new lines in tie the string onto it, then just pull the string and the new lines will follow the path back to the finder. Saves on pulling panels off and reaching up under and around ."
564863,fishnsled,2011-03-23 02:10:00,3520,"Very simple. You'll have to remove the one back panel, cut a few cable ties, unscrew the old transducer, install the new one. Try to use the old holes and screws if you can. If not I left the old screws in and just drill some new holes. Don't forget the marine grade silicone on all holes and screws.  As you wrap up the old transducer, follow the wiring under the dash. Where you unplugged the old one, plug in the new one for power, you'll need some connectors for this. Run the wires needed up to the unit and plug it in. Make sure all is working. Dress the cables, put the back panel on, wait 24 hours for the silicone to set up and then go fishing.  There might be something I'm forgetting but this should give you a pretty good idea. About a couple of hours and you should have it done."
564867,fishnsled,2011-03-23 02:18:00,3520,"  Good tip if the wires don't have cables ties every 6 inches like mine did . :wallbash: It should just be the one panel and 6-8 screws that you have to remove, or you might be lucky and the string will work. If your boat is anything similar to my 1750, most of the wiring is tied in with the control cables and for the most part everything is exposed."
