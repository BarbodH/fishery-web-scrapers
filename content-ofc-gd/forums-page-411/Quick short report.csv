693273,misfish,2012-05-05 16:26:00,29133,"The rain is just what the creeks needed here. Nice running waters and pools had some color to them. My set up was a 5.5 fenwick light action rod,4 pound test line,2 BB shots and a Powerbait 3 inch natural worm.  Rewarded with a nice natural rainbow. I was targeting Browns.  Team one will not like it,but I left my tape in my hoody,at home.   Im guessing 18 inches.Sign is 4x6 . Nice red line and cheeks.  Real nice fish.Chunky to. Released to play another day.      Hitting it again Sunday morning."

693382,alexmedic,2012-05-05 23:26:00,186,"If that is the same creek that I think it is, try a mepps #1 rainbow.  The browns always seem to hit it there!"

693506,misfish,2012-05-06 17:23:00,29133,"  I hear ya Mike. I got several this morning,wee ones. I walked and walked. Some real beautiful water.So many log jams to fish (and lose tackle   )  After today,Im thinking I want to try fly fishing. There was some kind of hatch today,and I seen many fish surfase.I tried keeping the spin bait on the surface,but no takers.  One spot,I sat and just watched the water. The action was crazy. Wish I had a fly."
693514,Leecher,2012-05-06 17:49:00,7832, The hatch you saw was May Flies B... Last Friday I saw lots of them get eaten    while I was trowing hardware    Trout were gorging themselves jumping clear out of the water   Wish I had flies in my tackle box
