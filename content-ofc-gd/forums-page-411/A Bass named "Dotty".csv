693440,aplumma,2012-05-06 12:24:00,6896,We have a Blue catfish we have caught on average once or twice a year for the past 4 years. We named her Fluffy from a scar she has on here back looks like cotton. She averages 2 to 4 lbs per year and it puts her at 48 lbs if she shows up this year. Nice fish but kind of dumb she falls for the big chunks of shad every year.lol   Art
