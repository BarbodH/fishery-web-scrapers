693320,limeyangler,2012-05-05 20:02:00,5204,"Obviously i could care less about your property TJ...cuz the first thing I thought when i saw the first pic was...""good firewood"".   Nice pike the missus got there"

693333,Roy,2012-05-05 20:52:00,13728,"Musta been windy at some point. Skin it, cut it up in 16"" knotless lengths, let them dry and we'll make some baits. As for my sweetie, we have room for her on team#1. Glad you're getting out and about and thanks for the pics."
