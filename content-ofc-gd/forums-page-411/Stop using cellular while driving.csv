You can look in but you can just say pop your trunk or open your glove box, or let me dig under your seat unless you have reasonable grounds to go searching... EG smell drugs in the car, see spent bullet casings on the floor etc..."
694241,Headhunter,2012-05-08 15:17:00,5703,"Got off the 401 at Brock in Pickering the other day and there was a cop waiting on the off ramp, no disguise, watching for people on their phone while driving. There was another one on the other side of the 401 checking people as they were heading onto the 401. I have to agree with others who have said this is simply a tax grab. No, I do not like having some numb skull in front of me texting away, but I would rather see the authorities catch someone for wreckless/bad driving while on the phone, than someone simply on the phone... HH"
694243,BillM,2012-05-08 15:21:00,17367, You don't see the correlation between stopping these people now BEFORE they have a chance to kill someone because they are too busy txting?
694252,jedimaster,2012-05-08 15:32:00,3472, At a stoplight?
694254,BillM,2012-05-08 15:39:00,17367," Actually I think we should just fine them after they've killed some innocent family on the highway, that sounds like a much better solution.."
694257,fishing n autograph,2012-05-08 15:43:00,2540,"Easier to spot, same with seat belts. Best was is at a stop light people will recognize a marked police car before a officer on foot"
694262,jedimaster,2012-05-08 15:58:00,3472," I tihnk you are completly missing the point of what I am saying. The article specifically targets people who happen to pull out there phone to check something while stopped at a stop light. I can honestly say i see no harm in this. While driving, yah sure, while stopped? Nope. Don't see it. Show me one time when someone that was sending a text message while stopped at a stop light caused a death in an accident.  Are you presuming that because a person waited until it was reasonably safe to take a quick peek at there phone while stopped at a stoplight also does the same while they are driving? Are you now presuming they are guilty of something they have not done? Is it a violantion against the highway traffic act to check a text message at a stop light? Yes. Is that specific act dangerous? NO. It's not. While driving, yah sure, pull them over. While stopped? thats just lame. Easier or not, they are not preventing anything. They are only making revenue because its an easy grab in the quota bag."
694264,BillM,2012-05-08 16:04:00,17367," I'm not missing the point, I just added in a whole bunch of very obvious sarcasm.   I agree that checking your phone while stopped at a stoplight isn't a dangerous act in itself, the issue here is that the law doesn't differentiate between the two..  Until it does people need to just obey the law, it's that simple."
694266,Headhunter,2012-05-08 16:07:00,5703,"Yah Bill, I would... I would rather they patrol the highway looking for folks who are driving poorly, then wasting resouces catching folks at on ramps and off ramps... HH"
694289,John,2012-05-08 17:29:00,2956,"Joe, in general terms I agree with you 100%. Nothing frustrates me more than a radar trap pulling car after car for 25 or 30 over and completely ignoring the idiots who tailgate, weave in and out and put the rest of our lives and those of our loved ones in danger. It's easier.........that simple.  But, jedimaster, what about the person at a stoplight texting away? They are in most cases completely oblivious to what it going on around them and the fact that their vehicle is in ""drive"" and their foot on the brake completely absent from their mind. How much lack of concentration does it take to relax the foot on the brake and run over the person crossing in front of you......or texting away as the light turns green and someone behind you lays on the horn.......you stomp on the gas and run into the car in front........seen it more than once. Is the act of picking up a text message or IM at a stoplight dangerous, YES, absolutely no question about it.  I have clients all over the world, some of whom want to tear off a piece of my a$$ at the most inconvenient time. Do i talk on the phone in the car, absolutely, fully hands free with auto answer, but I never answer an IM or text in the car whether I am stationary or moving. I am of the opinion that there is a huge difference."
694301,Headhunter,2012-05-08 17:58:00,5703,"Exactly John... I beleive that police presence on the highway has a much bigger foot print on people, than standing on an off ramp. A cruiser gets attention and that could mean that the knuckle head doing, 140 weaving in and out of traffic will take notice and change their ways. Admittedly, if only for a short time. HH"
694303,jedimaster,2012-05-08 18:04:00,3472," Show me a case of someone texting at a stop light and them letting go of the brake  and killing someone.... I have seen and know a person that was recently severely crushed by a person that accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake. they were not texting. An idiot is an idiot on the road regardless if they are reading a text message, answering a phone call, listening to the radio or not.  You are making a fairly blanket statement about someone quickly glancing at an incoming message being so oblivious that they can't keep there foot on the brake. Sorry you point doesn't hold much water to me. Again I would still trade 100 traffic cops dressed as hobo's for one vice, or criminal or even a guy in a cruiser on the highways. Waste of resources imo purely to raise revenue and nothing more."

693867,Lunkerhunter,2012-05-07 17:03:00,455,"i have to agree completely with sinclair. i too work in an industry where my attention is required quickly on most manners. in fact if i didnt have my cell phone there would be a lot of midweek days where im fishing that i just wouldnt be able to make it happen.  having my phone allows me to work when im not at work so to speak. if one of my staff or customers is having an issue i can address it immediately and ensure it is dealt with properly the first time.  now there are many times when I go away for the weekend fishing or even during the week i leave my phone at home or off but its those times when i get away from the office mid week and still dont miss a beat that make things work.  i also think the whole what did we do before cell phones excuse is pretty Bull , you could say that about absolutely every breakthrough in history. what did doctors do before xray machines, MRI units etc. technology is an amazing thing and it helps streamline thinks and make things more efficient.  i dont agree with the whole driving while on the phone or texting at all. i think its a great law for us to have in place, but i think people need to wake up when it comes to the world we live in today and realize cell phones are apart of it all. some rely on it for work, some for pleasure, some have them and recieve 1 call a week. im on my cell phone for work some months up to 5000 minutes across North America and recieve a minimum of 100 emails a day. when in the truck i use my bluetooth thats connected to the speakers of my truck and i dont answer my texts or emails while driving. pretty simple really. i think people will get the point eventually. there is no denying having a cell phone can be extremely convenient at times as well, who the hell uses pay phones anymore anyway....most of them have been removed now and i rarely see them at all."

So i don't care what business you think you need to do, or that you think having a life is a function of how many calls you get everyday, it in general is an unsafe practice, so either don't do it, or hopefully you will get every ticket you deserve.  If its impossible for you to get by without driving and talking on the phone find a new job.  Btw, it isn't the act of having a phone, or even holding it that is the problem, there is something about having a conversation with someone who isn't beside you that makes it more distracting, its been shown that hands free devices do not improve peoples concentration.  As an aside i find it amusing that anyone thinks being called every few minutes is 'having a life'."
693875,blarg,2012-05-07 17:23:00,289," You CHOOSE to put yourself in a position of 'requiring' it, that choice does not override my NEED of safety on the highway.  This isn't rocket surgery."
693876,GbayGiant,2012-05-07 17:25:00,1780,"I wonder what other charges will be laid now that officers can sneak up and have a look inside your private space and see what you are doing. They may as well have a look inside your house with the excuse of justifying that you could be doing something wrong. It’s a way for police to monitor how drivers act naturally, outside of a police presence.  Ready to pounce at their first excuse. I am sure I will hear from an officers perspective. Roll over people."

Take the seat belt law; yes I know and respect the fact that they do save lives, in an accident. But how does not wearing a seat belt impair your driving or make you a danger to other drivers. My point being you can’t call the interior of your car your priate space and a cop or anyone for that matter can take a peek through the window. Come to think of it isn’t there a law about tinting the front and rear windshields; because the cops can’t see in, if they are to heavily tinted?  Dan."
693954,GbayGiant,2012-05-07 20:17:00,1780, Right idea. Wrong reason and one that takes away our rights. Everyone should have tinted windows. Because they can. I would not open my window to anyone who walked up to me at a street light even if they showed me a badge. I would not believe them. I do not have a cell phone do not have to worry about being stopped. Next you will be telling me that my house is on the street and I have no rights.
693957,fishermccann,2012-05-07 20:28:00,655,I do not think you have the right to refuse a lawful request by a police officer.There is also a charge for that.

How is it that no one realizes their rights are being taken away with this idea. Turn a blind eye to what the issue is when it is disguised or hidden for other reasons.
693974,fishermccann,2012-05-07 21:01:00,655,"Yes, you can do what you want, BUT you saw his badge, and would most likly  be found guilty in court. You would have made your point, but  you would still pay the price for refusel."

Makes as much sence as your statment.He is busting people who are breaking the law,  I have no simpathy for criminals. If you talk on the phone while driving YOU ARE a criminal.What they should do is take away the phone untill you get to court."
693990,jedimaster,2012-05-07 21:40:00,3472,"If you don't realize there is a HUGE waste of resources in the traffic policing side of things because it is used as a revenue generation scheme, you are fooling yourself. I am not saying that people shouldn't obey the traffic laws but if you are happier to have government money funding projects like this that could instead be used to fund the policing of bigger crimes than there really is nothing to talk about? I would trade 100 fender benders for one less violent crime or one more violent crimanal behind bars.  I know several traffic cops, and several cops in other areas, and they ALL feel the same way. Traffic policing is required but is purely there for revenue generation and nothing more.  If there was a concern about cell phones in car, then enforce a cell phone jammer into every car unless its connected to the vehicles bluetooth...  If speed kills then put a beacon on every speed sign and a reciever in every car that limits a cars speed.  If seatbelts save lives, then don't let the car engage in gear without it attached.  If drinking and driving  is dangerous than put an interlock on every car.  Traffic policing has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with revenue. Again I am not saying it shouldn't be done or people shouldn't obey the law I just don't for a second believe its nothing other than a tax grab."

694209,fishing n autograph,2012-05-08 13:38:00,2540,"I think you need to realize that the cops in those pictures are Traffic Enforcement Officers...not drugs and vice or sexual assault detectives or even front line uniform officers. Each unit does their thing. Those who were pictured were doing a project rather than being out there sitting at a stop sign or running radar. I've been involved in those projects too. Rather than dressing up as a panhandler I dressed up as a construction worker....  And to answer the question, you do have a reasonable about of privacy to your car, however, there is case law that states an officer can look in your windows (plain view doctrine) without a warrant. Your vehicle can be searched if there are grounds to search it. If you refuse to roll down your window to speak to an officer identifying himself as such then you're refusing to identify yourself and under the HTA you can be arrested which gives the officer grounds to search."

What I don't get about the bluetooth thing...you still have to answer the phone, dial out, find contact, hang up, turn on/off the earpiece etc etc just to use it. Am I guilty just by touching my phone, for example to dial out? Am I expected to have my earpiece in during my entire drive?? I still have to click the earpiece to answer a call...with my hand  I reemed out a guy at a gas station who nearly caused several accidents in front of my a couple weeks ago.

If your car is in motion you shouldn't be distracted from the task of driving by anything that takes your eyes off the road for more than 1-2 seconds. When I worked at Wally-World, I used to retrieve shopping carts and I nearly got nailed twice by ""ladies"" driving and talking on their hand-held's in the parking lot. There are other people and children in those lots and we all know how quick a child can dart out from a between cars.

693297,misfish,2012-05-05 18:13:00,29133, I was thinking more along the lines of entrapment.

693303,fishing n autograph,2012-05-05 18:36:00,2540," It's not entrapment. Entrapment means they are being forced to do something that the person wouldn't normally do. No one is forcing the driver to use his cell phone. It's the same thing for a speed trap. If a person is normally speeding its not entrapment.  That's like saying going under cover and wire taps are entrapment too.  Either way, that photo is from BC. Cell phone tickets don't fly in provincial court here because the government worded the law wrong. It is impossible to convict people on the cell phone law and 99% of the cell phone tickets are thrown out in court.  The BC law is worded much better and enforceable"

693318,limeyangler,2012-05-05 19:59:00,5204,"Not sure about the tactic...but i for one am fed up of being cut up/slowed down/ forced to take evasive action because some idiot is yaking on the phone while driving. The amount of times i've caught myself exclaiming ""WTH"" to myself about someone elses driving to then realise they are talking on the phone is becoming boring!"
693323,solopaddler,2012-05-05 20:24:00,8605, Wait a minute...there's actually traffic up there?   I'm guessing if you drove the Q.E.W. every day your head would spontaneously burst into flames.

693327,Pikeslayer,2012-05-05 20:35:00,1443,The only losers in this case are the idiots who have total disregard for the law. I don't care how they catch them. These self centered people who continue to text and talk while driving are ignorant
693328,limeyangler,2012-05-05 20:40:00,5204,"     LOL...I used to live(and drive) in London, England.....you know...that tiny little town with a population of 8 million...i have been in traffic that would make the Q.E.W seem like downtown Dryden...lol.  I dont think traffic volume has anything to do with the problem...hell..if your gonna use your cell while driving...at a standstill on the Q.E.W is probably the safest place to do it!"
693331,misfish,2012-05-05 20:44:00,29133," Thats my point. If you are stopped at a light or traffic,whats the problem? When I call the mrs,s,first thing I ask,are you driving? If the answer is yes,I say,call when your stopped.I hang up."
693335,Pikeslayer,2012-05-05 20:59:00,1443," Certainly you've been behind some idiot at a standstill with their head down, seemingly staring between their legs? They ain't admiring their package! They're texting, totally oblivious to what's happening around them. The traffic starts to move and a courtesy toot of the horn is sounded to get them moving. They jump on the gas and thank you with a one finger salute    . I think from now on, I'm gonna give them the courtesy toot just before the light turns or the traffic starts to move and see if the idiots manage to ram their front end into the car in front. Might be somewhat entertaining  ps. Brian, I'm sure your mrs of 30/31 years is definitely worthy of a Bluetooth from a loving husband."
693338,limeyangler,2012-05-05 21:01:00,5204," Alls i know is..is when i experience someone elses poor driving, hand on heart i can say a lot of the time i notice they are using a cell phone.  There are no exact figures for % of accidents caused by cell phone usage...however there are statistics that show that 'driver distraction' accounts for around 80% of car crashes. Using your phone is a distraction.  Sure...i know...talking is a distraction...listening to music is a distraction....gps devices are a distraction....the list goes on....i just happen to think, from personal experience, that a ban on cell phone use while driving is a good thing.  I think the only other thing that bugs me more than someone using a cell while driving is having a dog sitting on the drivers lap, peering over the steering wheel while driving...or filming with a child in a moving boat oooops....dont look at my latest report....lol)"
