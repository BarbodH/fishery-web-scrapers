693740,skinny,2012-05-07 09:32:00,442,Ok so got up like I was going o work (5:00). was wide awake so I headed to the local river. I get there to find the guys that are always there on the bank. I watch a guy land a nice rainbow. then I go to the other side and start to toss a mepps. and wahm fish on. After a fight I land a nice one. I keep tossing the silver mepps for some time without luck.I decide to try out my new rod and grab my selus with a pathermartin on it with big pink bell and toss away no luck. then on a whim I go back to my tuck and grab a rod with a wacky hook on it a a berkly pink worm hooked wacky style. I walk to the bank toss it in and fish on that s #2 . The third I hooked into was also on the worm and the bigest of the day. the only pictures I have are the other guys stringer with his fish also. I kept 2 so when I got home it was clean time. I had only ever once cleaned a lrg trout and it was bit of a hack job.  I took my time and dis a much beter job but I still feel something is not right in the way I did it. as I know there is a fair amout of bones left in the fillets . Is this the way it is.
