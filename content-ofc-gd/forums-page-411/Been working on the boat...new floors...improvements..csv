693703,Raf,2012-05-07 02:11:00,3495,nice job.. the 30 will push that just fine (i'd guess about 25-27mph with two guys) and the v6 will pull it just fine.
693704,Hooked,2012-05-07 02:13:00,891,"That looks flippin awesome Cliff, excellent job!  Looking forward to seeing some pics of fish in the boat now.  Great stuff!"
693712,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 02:24:00,7971," Thanks!  The tiller keeps things more open in a little 14 footer.  If my next boat is longer, then I may have to think about going to a console...we'll see. lol  The Kia Spectra was rated at 1000 lbs for towing.  It was more the tongue weight...in order to tow it comfortably, I had to move the floor to the back of the boat.  Even then, the suspension just isn't made to tow."
693713,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 02:27:00,7971, That sounds about right Raf.  Got up on plane fast and cruised along quite nicely.  I didn't add much weight to the boat...mostly replaced old plywood.    Thanks!  Cant wait to get it out on the water now!
693714,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 02:28:00,7971, LOL Will...I went to mount it the other way and realized the wiring wouldn't reach!  Thanks for all your help!
693717,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 02:56:00,7971," LOL...just so you know, it was more than a few days.  I usually had 30 minute to the odd hour to work on it.  Started this job over a month ago!"
693726,Leecher,2012-05-07 03:26:00,7832,Time to get that new carpet some fish slime Great work Cliff   Looks Good
693733,Victor,2012-05-07 05:01:00,1609,looks awesome cliff. Looking forward to your first report in the boat!
693755,Fish Farmer,2012-05-07 11:53:00,2234,Very good job. Makes one feel proud to stand back and say I did that myself
693759,kickingfrog,2012-05-07 12:04:00,8333, That is not how you should treat your customers.
693766,fishindevil,2012-05-07 12:37:00,6254,nice looking rig cliff !!!! you will enjoy it for sure ...
693793,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 13:51:00,7971,Thanks again everone!  It's been very rewarding working on it and having good results like this.  It's amazing this is the same boat!  Before    After 
694019,GBW,2012-05-07 23:10:00,8460,I looks so good Cliff; I guess I can let you tie it up on the dock at the lake any time I'm there...
694136,highdrifter,2012-05-08 04:49:00,2534,Nice revamp Cliff!!
694137,limeyangler,2012-05-08 06:24:00,5204,great job Cliff......   What did you use to water seal the plywood?
694176,BITEME,2012-05-08 11:57:00,1968,Nice work Cliff  and to think not too long ago you were such a noob!  Peter
694187,ccmtcanada,2012-05-08 12:33:00,7971," Thanks!  The name of the game was to do this job as cheap as possible and structurally sound. I had a full can of Thompson's Water Seal left over from sealing my deck so I used that. I also used an outdoor carpet adhesive. The most expensive things were the stainless steel screws, locking nuts and bolts!"
694188,ccmtcanada,2012-05-08 12:39:00,7971," Peter  I'm still a noob, but thanks! Lol. Have to admit though, I'm really happy with how this turned out."
694192,Roy,2012-05-08 12:51:00,13728," You should have purchased them at Canadian Tire, Cliff."
694224,RangerGuy,2012-05-08 14:18:00,564,"Just saw this thread, NICE JOB!!.. She looks brand new"
694235,ccmtcanada,2012-05-08 14:54:00,7971," Trust me, I got all I could from Canadian Tire...my discount is key to that! LOL"
694258,reelinrolly,2012-05-08 15:53:00,281,That looks amazing.   I wanna do the same to my boat!!!!
694259,Spiel,2012-05-08 15:53:00,9065,"Wow, nice work Cliff, obviously more than just a pretty face."
693572,ccmtcanada,2012-05-06 19:57:00,7971,"You may or may not remember, but at the end of last summer, I purchased a boat.  It came with removable floors, but there were a few issues.  The first is that the floor didn't go all the way to the bow.  Because of that there wasn't a lot of room for the foot pedal for the trolling motor when sitting up front.  The plywood was old, weathered and beginning to rot out and the 'shelf' where the trolling motor was mounted wasn't quite long enough, so it hung off the end.   First order of business was to replace that shelf up front.  It's now plenty big enough to mount the trolling motor properly.   Then with Fishnsled's help on design...we figured out a good way to extend the floor all the way to the bow instead of leaving that space open from the front bench forward.   Water sealed all the parts   Put on some marine grade carpeting....   Now the floor extends all the way to the bow...and can be raised for storage.   Now came the task of replacing the rotting plywood for the main part of the casting deck.   Brand new plywood, water sealed and ready for assembly.   Best make sure it fits in the boat before I go any further...CHECK!   Time to carpet, make sure the hatch is installed and lifts up...and put the seat base back in.   Fits like a glove!  WHEW!   Today I finished things off...reinstalled the trolling motor bracket and wiring, and reinstalled the light base.   Oh yeah...one other thing.  I towed this boat with my Kia Spectra just 2 times last summer.  I just wasn't comfortable even though it seemed to pull the boat (and stop) just fine.  So a few weeks ago, I purchased a 2009 Hyundai Tucson V6.  I'm all set now to hit the water!!!   I want to thank Fishnsled for the use of his ideas as well as tools!  We'll get out in it soon hopefully!"
693578,kickingfrog,2012-05-06 20:06:00,8333,Real nice.
693579,i2cool2fool,2012-05-06 20:07:00,349,Nice job!
693580,misfish,2012-05-06 20:09:00,29133,"Great job,Nice and clean looking. Your pulling it with a what?"
693582,davey buoy,2012-05-06 20:14:00,5505,"Real nice job!!,but you didn't have to keep the boat on it's side to work on it."
693584,Rod Caster,2012-05-06 20:17:00,5784,wow that looks great Cliff. A relatively easy project that pays huge dividends.  Its got me thinking about installing a carpeted casting deck on my sportspal
693590,Muskieman,2012-05-06 20:30:00,2472,"Great upgrade Cliff , good job !"
693591,solopaddler,2012-05-06 20:35:00,8605,Looks great Cliff!
693603,Wolf 3,2012-05-06 21:03:00,134,Looks great.  Nice job.  
693606,ccmtcanada,2012-05-06 21:14:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  Wasn't a lot of work, but I only had short periods of time to work on it.  Hopefully get it out in the next few weeks.  The most expensive parts of this job?  The stainless steel screws!!   Brian...what?  Have there been a few contentious towing threads or something of late?? The entire package is less than 1000 lbs, so I have no worries    When I previewed this post, the pics were all rotated 90 degrees....so I went and edited them all.  They show ok here....is it still messing up on some screens?"

693610,lew,2012-05-06 21:37:00,12766,"Excellent job Cliff, it's always nice to get things rigged up just exactly the way we like them."
693612,mike rousseau,2012-05-06 21:52:00,4661,Nice overhaul....  It's fun making your boat custom...
693614,misfish,2012-05-06 22:07:00,29133, LOL  Nice work Cliff.
693616,Tybo,2012-05-06 22:12:00,1373,Great work Cliff. Now you need a bigger puttputt on the back for the extra weight.
693622,woodenboater,2012-05-06 22:33:00,2277,"Hey Cliff,  Curious why you went carpet instead of vinyl for the flooring. Is it a slip thing, or a cushy, squeeze the carpet with your toes thing  and great job on the extended deck and trolling mount.   WB"
693624,ccmtcanada,2012-05-06 22:43:00,7971,"   Lew and Mike,  Thanks!  I have to admit, it's pretty satisfying doing this and having it turn out well.  Can't wait to get it out on the water now!    The 30hp that's on there already scares me full out...one time gunned it WOT and it felt like the back was going to swing out on me! LOL    Hey thanks!  To tell you the truth, vinyl never even crossed my mind!  I do like the feel of the carpet though...."
693673,mistaredone,2012-05-07 00:55:00,913,Nice job.  Looks pro
693677,kickingfrog,2012-05-07 01:03:00,8333, I was thinking the same thing. I may pick up a fixer-upper and drop it off at chateau cliff and pick it up in a few days.
693682,mercman,2012-05-07 01:25:00,7054,Amazing upgrade Cliff !! Looks like a reak fish blaster !!!
693685,Roy,2012-05-07 01:38:00,13728,"Nice clean job, Cliff. Congratulations, you'll be really happy with that."
693686,NAW,2012-05-07 01:42:00,4022,Nice work Cliff!  and nice Tiller!!  How much could the Kia pull?
693689,ccmtcanada,2012-05-07 01:48:00,7971,Thanks Roy!  Can't wait to get it out...maybe next weekend with my little one if the weather holds.
693691,fishnsled,2012-05-07 01:49:00,3520," Looks awesome Cliff except you put the trolling motor on the wrong side..... I have a feeling I know why you did it that way.   That boat is fine with the extra weight, it moves very well with 2 guys, gear and wood floor. Can't remember what it did on the gps last year, will have to test it out again soon."
693700,BillM,2012-05-07 02:08:00,17367,"Cliff, boat looks awesome!"
