Second sequence he plunges talons into deep water right to the bottom  to grab his prey.  Third sequence he captures a big old fat fish that looks as if it weighs more  than he does!    This is incredible to watch         <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nA3LtXnNIto"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

693172,davey buoy,2012-05-05 01:20:00,5505,Never gets tiring watching that video. Just an amazing predator!!!!.Thanks for showing.
693301,ADB,2012-05-05 18:17:00,444,Very cool.  I'd like to know how they knew to film that 2nd fish underwater before the osprey struck...
693508,fishinmortician,2012-05-06 17:28:00,100,"I had the opportunity to fish in Nova Scotia for 4 months last year.  If you saw an Osprey, you stopped to throw a line in.  Here's a pic of one grabbing a Sea Trout in front of me   "
693512,tb4me,2012-05-06 17:43:00,3295,I always wondered the same thing with all documentaries..I guess it involves camera's everywhere and hours and hours of footage..just for 7 seconds of useable footage..Unreal the dedication involved eh...
693636,l2p,2012-05-06 23:24:00,346," True! I was fishing at the Bedok Jetty in East Coast park down here in SG yesterday and watched as locals would cast to where these two osprey would dive down, they were on them good and anyone who landed a cast in the area would hook up. Only small fish though called ""Tamban"" but there were millions of them and their great eats, so im told haha."
