693902,Pikeslayer,2012-05-07 18:18:00,1443,Looked like a perfect meal  . Do you harvest any pike Simon?  Simon
693905,manitoubass2,2012-05-07 18:27:00,11391,"ahhh man I love your reports...  Thats a nice pike! Great shot of Roloff as well.  ""Look at the stripes on his tail!"" lol, Jack is awesome!!!"
694002,colin519,2012-05-07 22:29:00,101,Did you catch that pike on a bare jig head with no leader?
694008,spincast,2012-05-07 22:38:00,3279,Simon -- You sure do have a nice back yard..................... great family time - Jack's a riot - so into every fish you guys land
694016,Christopheraaron,2012-05-07 23:00:00,3525,"Jack sure does love that ""paddle"" stick!"
694139,limeyangler,2012-05-08 07:52:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies folks    awww come on.....lol    Yah...the dog is even enjoying the water more now that it does not freeze internal organs on contact!     Hey Si, no i dont. I tried it once and it was ok its just that the wife is not keen on it. I dont like freezing fish simply because i dont really need to....and i would have way to much fish for one sitting if i harvested pike. I sometimes only harvest half my limit of walleye as thats more than enough to feed us...and if i have left overs there are far more takers for walleye than pike.   Thanks Rick...he is super observant...as are most 3 year olds...dont miss a gosh darned thing!    yes and no. Yes i had no 'wire' leader if thats what you mean....dunno why but i rarely get bit off using the 17lb flourocarbon leader, and no because the jig is only bare because it scarfed down a 6"" live, tail hooked  dace minnow.   Thanks Will......hopefully Jack can emulate the feats of the amazing multi-talented angler that is the G-Man!     Lol...yeah...we have to insist he leaves it at home now too...he wants to take it to town....to daycare...shopping....lol...he definitely loves it alright."

694153,limeyangler,2012-05-08 10:26:00,5204,  Lol Bob...more canadian by the day!  I think some day i will get round to making/buying/stealing a smoker...then everything will be thrown in at least once just to see what its like.
694159,Billy Bob,2012-05-08 10:46:00,5865,The more oily the fish the better....White Fish is #1....then salmon/trout and Pike is very good also.....this year I will be trying smallmouth from Erie and see how it comes out. If it's not good I will gift it to my youngest son....LOL....he like anything that's free (my favorite four letter word...and his too)...LOL
694161,limeyangler,2012-05-08 10:58:00,5204, Iv'e heard whitefish is phenomenal smoked!  As for four letter words i cant comment....sesame street is not on up here until 9 am
