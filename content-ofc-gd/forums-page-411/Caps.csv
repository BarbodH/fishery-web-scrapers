694108,Dan668,2012-05-08 02:21:00,1120,Damn caps. Seriously couldn't hold off not high sticking in the final minute. Their finished now
694110,blaque,2012-05-08 02:24:00,2419,Agreed....great game though
694117,Dan668,2012-05-08 02:42:00,1120,"Ah well, being a leaf fan I'm used to my favorite teams losing. New jerseys taking it this year"
694126,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-08 03:16:00,10439,  Unless the Kings beat them.
694129,Dan668,2012-05-08 03:23:00,1120,I'm relying on mike smith to stop them
694182,Christopheraaron,2012-05-08 12:19:00,3525,Now that nashville and the caps are out anyone's good for me!
694184,BillM,2012-05-08 12:25:00,17367," Wow man, you really gotta watch the games a bit closer.   Rangers/Cap is now 3-2 in the series."
694228,tb4me,2012-05-08 14:22:00,3295,"3 2 1 Ovie sucks, Ovie sucks, Ovie sucks...lol thought that was funny lastnight.. Who comes up with this stuff anyway.."
694269,Rod Caster,2012-05-08 16:13:00,5784, Yessir! His stats are unbelievable!  I hope Semin gets in a fight and girl-slaps another person. Caps are not a great team and NYR can't slip them past Holtby. Kings and jersey seem to have the best overall teams at the moment.
694291,Christopheraaron,2012-05-08 17:34:00,3525," I watch, and I know it's only 3-2 but I am just calling their playoff hopes dead!"
694316,davey buoy,2012-05-08 18:53:00,5505," I agree caps will take it imo. Philly I'm hoping as well,but Jersey's playing well."
694319,BillM,2012-05-08 18:55:00,17367,"Philly hasn't been the same since the Pittsburg series, it's like a completely different team."
694322,davey buoy,2012-05-08 18:59:00,5505," No Giroux,they owe him,I think you will see a different team tonight!"
694362,misfish,2012-05-08 21:15:00,29133,"Philly will be fine,Caps are toast. Ovie, is one player I really didn,t like, all his show boating/shanadigans. I have gained some respect for him. He,s a tough player,But I think he,s been hit hard to many times (target) he,s not even 70%.   The kings are a nice surprise.   I give total praise to Belford. Will be known as the greatest of all time. DESERVING."
694368,davey buoy,2012-05-08 21:24:00,5505," It hurts me when you talk like that,lol. ovie is the player everyone likes to hate,unless he's on your team:thumbsup_anim:.He's been beaten up sure,but the results could of gone the other way.Washington at times were the better team. My pool has LA ,Pheonix, Washington.I'll have to agree to disagree.We'll see what happens!!!!!!!!!!."
