Sunday was the pike tourney so we definitely didn't want to be there then. From what I heard, there were almost 60 boats registered. We worked a few promising spots but with a Northeast wind, fishing wasn't great. I was 1 for 2 with live bait and my cousin got skunked fishing artificials. 6lb northern graced the pan for Sunday lunch after my wife ran the Mississauga half marathon."
