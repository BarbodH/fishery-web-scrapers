693816,TJQ,2012-05-07 15:04:00,7806,"2 more pike yesterday and this nice bass... had to destroy the evidence though... not one fish for me!!!      Now I just think shes mocking me!!!!    Then she made me clean it... doh!!    Then she made me cook it!!! (lemon pepper on one side, seasoning salt on the other) AND she wouldn't even let me have a piece!!    Even the birds left in disgust.    I dunno what to do.. marriage counselling I guess."
693825,mercman,2012-05-07 15:22:00,7054,Nice !!! Just be happy that you have found the perfect fishing partner T.J. !
693826,Rod Caster,2012-05-07 15:22:00,5784,"haha, oh slave boy, OH SLAVE BOY!  By my tally, that's 4-0 for her"

693830,TJQ,2012-05-07 15:27:00,7806,"LOL... Gotta love zone 8! I wish someone would tell me why theres no closed season for bass up here, or pike for that matter... what makes it so different here."
693832,John,2012-05-07 15:32:00,2956," Go on guys, I double dog dare ya!"
693833,capt bruce,2012-05-07 15:34:00,820," Lots of guys like YOU .. Dont need a season when guys cant catch anything , might have to bring in regs if you keep bringing wife's , but as long as its only guys like you ??????? Why make a limit when you guys limit yourselves ... LMAO   B"
693836,TJQ,2012-05-07 15:44:00,7806, Thats harsh!!
693848,limeyangler,2012-05-07 16:12:00,5204,You dont need counselling...you need to write a book about how keep a wonderful relationship going

693928,irishfield,2012-05-07 19:17:00,26272,Keep killin them Green Carp.. that's all I gotta say!!  Looking fun TJ and I see things haven't changed. Hope you chased that old Bass down with some good whiskey at least!  See ya soon.. I hope!
693999,Dave Bailey,2012-05-07 22:13:00,1641,  Yeah...   ...   ...   ...   ...   But accurate!
694005,bigbuck,2012-05-07 22:32:00,2449,"Happy wife.......Happy life. She can outfish you when you are with her but when you are out with the lads, then you can REALLY fish."
694006,Moosebunk,2012-05-07 22:37:00,3970," Walleye are the mainstay of the Near North; and North for that matter.  My thought would be TJ, that because the walleye stocks are often the most in jeopardy from harvest, then to help them out why not keep predator pike and opportunistic bass open all year to hopefully have some anglers like yourself, find the balance....?  ie, a tasty smallie under the knife."
694007,HTHM,2012-05-07 22:37:00,4082,Suck it up.....
694015,Nipfisher,2012-05-07 22:55:00,2449, I can't understand why Zone 11 has a closed pike season????? I understand closing Nipissing to all species but why not open pike in the other lakes? I'm not a trout guy so all I have open to me is perch.
694021,irishfield,2012-05-07 23:26:00,26272, Just another screw up from when they combined the old zones! I could always fish Pike on Temagami when we got up there on Mother's Day.. can't anymore and have to wait now. Guess they figured it was a way to know if someone was fishing they were breaking the law.. but they forgot about Whitefish being open all year!
