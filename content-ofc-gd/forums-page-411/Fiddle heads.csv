691117,Rod Caster,2012-04-29 03:49:00,5784,"Still no fiheads in my area yet. The ground is still holding frost in some spots but, the forest looks ready to burst into growth! Is the ground-snow/frost 100 percent melted in Barrie, yet?"
691130,misfish,2012-04-29 10:31:00,29133,"Hum,,,,,second pick.   "
691132,spinnerdoc,2012-04-29 10:45:00,556,Picked some yesterday but not too much just enough for one person bec. they are not out in my neck of the woods...lucked out on a good looking stocker as well  
691158,NAW,2012-04-29 12:58:00,4022,"Nice!  What I thought where going to be fidle heads at my place turned out to some weird type of fern.  They coil the same as fidle heads, but have a red stem, not green?  Don't think they would taste very good!"
691279,NAW,2012-04-29 23:06:00,4022,"Found some just off my property!!  A little mature, but there was enough for a meal.    "

691296,Christopheraaron,2012-04-30 00:09:00,3525,That's one good looking meal!

694097,JustinHoffman,2012-05-08 02:08:00,482,"Hello All,  Did a 16.9km hike today. Found my first ever ""patch"" of fiddleheads. Many different stages of growth at this spot, with quite a few just beginning to sprout through the earth. Ended up bringing 112 home with me      Had my first taste tonight....YUMMY! Might have to make a return to this little area later in the week...  Also found two deer sheds in very good condition. That brings my total to nine sheds this spring. Definitely still some out there to be found!    A great day to be outside for sure...  Cheers,  Justin"
694125,Nipfisher,2012-05-08 03:11:00,2449,These are some fiddle heads I found right here in the city. Just along the creek. They were delicious.      
694168,Rod Caster,2012-05-08 11:36:00,5784,Good stuff justin and Blair. They still haven't sprouted where I look as of yet. This week it should start. Funny how the climate in town allows for much earlier growth then a location just 15kms away.
694205,jedimaster,2012-05-08 13:33:00,3472,"Found some fiddleheads in algonquin this past weekend as well. Too bad I didn't find any brookies. I did find a pretty nice sized shed, I'll post a pic of it tonight..."
694276,ckrb2007,2012-05-08 16:38:00,449,"I picked about a pound for the wife this morning around an un-named creek near Barrie while ""trying"" to chase resident browns. I caught 4 but I'm sure their combined weight was less then the pound of fiddleheads."
687601,Harrison,2012-04-17 19:55:00,2202,"Never picked them before, I think I will take my daughter tonight.  So you want them closer to the ground and covered in brown for the ideal harvest?"
687642,Sinker,2012-04-17 21:06:00,8692,"They seem to be small around here too, Brian. They are starting though.  Should be good this weekend for sure. I'll be out getting my share. I never miss my brook trout with a side of fiddle heads in the spring!!  S."
687647,misfish,2012-04-17 21:11:00,29133,  I remember them being atleast quarter size or bigger. I did see some breaking through some sand banks that were bigger. Still havent found this wild garlic. This weekend will be a fish and fiddle adventure.
687712,bassjnkie,2012-04-17 23:35:00,1101,"I see fiddle heads every year, and never thought they where edible. Sorry if I'm starting a side post here, but what is the best way to cook them? Thanks.  Daniel"
687715,Fisherman,2012-04-17 23:43:00,7201,"Steam them for about 4-5 minutes, add a very  light dusting of garlic powder and a plop of butter, no damm margerine. Oh and make sure they are real fiddleheads not the other variety called Braken Ferns."
687716,Nipfisher,2012-04-17 23:44:00,2449,  The fiddle heads or baby ferns are delicious when fried in butter and flavoured with salt and pepper. When they are close to the ground they are best. Either pull them by hand or cut them with a knife.  The taller they get the tougher they get.
687720,Garnet,2012-04-17 23:52:00,2056,Butter pepper and white vinegar
687727,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 00:21:00,5784," They don't need to be covered in the brown sheath. As long as the ""fiddle"" is tightly wrapped, they are good to go. Just pinch them lightly with your finger and thumb..if the ""fiddle"" is firm... it's good! I've picked them from half and inch to 1.5 feet off the ground...some of them grow incredibly tall and quick.  Just remember they grow in bundles of 6 or 7 for each plant, so only pick 2 or 3 from each to ensure the plant stays alive. Use a knife, it'll cause much less bruising.  Also, don't bother freezing them, I'm sure there is a way to make them taste ok, but you won't get the true charm of their flavor once they hit the freezer. Just my opinion of course."
687729,Fish Farmer,2012-04-18 00:23:00,2234,"I'm surprised that there not stubs in the picture   I've picked them that size Chris, but not any bigger."
687730,bassjnkie,2012-04-18 00:27:00,1101,     Cool thanks for the fast replies. Gonna go out and look for them tomorrow.
687733,chris.brock,2012-04-18 00:35:00,4053,"I picked a few on the weekend, most aren't out yet though (Oakville), this weekend should be good down here I like to drizzle balsamic vinegar and olive oil on them, shake them around abit, and put them right on the BBQ grill for a short time, taste better than boiled or steamed in my opinion"
687737,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-18 00:42:00,2582, I have tried them boiled and steamed and am really not a fan. But this sounds worth a try to me. Thx for sharing that
687748,Sinker,2012-04-18 01:08:00,8692,"I like them raw, with a bit of dip. Fantastic!  S."
687793,dave524,2012-04-18 03:16:00,4508," For sure make certain you are getting the Ostrich Ferns for your fiddleheads, the ones that grow along the creeks, not the Brakens that are found on higher ground. Braken ferns are actually poisonous and a known carcinogen."
687832,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 10:50:00,5784,Even the ostrich fern contain a mild toxin that could give you a stomach ache... Which is why its recommended to steam/boil them and discard of the green water. I agree that they probably taste much better raw or blanched vs boiled
687834,turtle,2012-04-18 11:03:00,274,"Picked my first of the year yesterday. They were tasty. Few and far between though.  Most of the root clumps dont have any new growth on them.  I steam them for 10 minutes if eating fresh.  Otherwise if storing I blanche them for 2 minutes, freeze them and when cooking steam for maybe 5 minutes. I read in a number of places not to eat them uncooked. I dont like the look of the water I steam/boil them in, tannin or something."
688009,Garnet,2012-04-18 19:13:00,2056,Seen a roads side sign on 7A towards Port Perry from Blackstock selling Fiddleheads.
688013,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 19:24:00,5784,"If you drive through New Brunswick, you'll see provincial signs that lead to fiddlehead picking areas. They take their fiddlehead picking seriously out there!"
688094,turtle,2012-04-18 21:53:00,274,"This was in today's media:  Fiddleheads are one of nature's earliest gifts for those who love the edible shoots of the ostrich fern. But it's best to be safe when preparing the young sprouts -- which look like the curled heads of miniature violins -- to avoid getting sick.   Fiddleheads are collected along the banks of rivers and streams and sold as a seasonal vegetable at farmers markets, roadside stands and in some grocery stores.   Fresh fiddleheads must be cooked properly and should never be eaten raw. There have been cases of temporary illness in Canada and the United States associated with eating raw or undercooked fiddleheads. Studies so far have not determined the cause of these illnesses, Health Canada says in a release.   Prior to cooking, the agency recommends removing as much of the brown husk as possible from the fiddleheads. Fresh fiddleheads should then be washed in several changes of clean cold water. Cook them in boiling water for 15 minutes or steam them for 10 to 12 minutes. The water used for boiling or steaming fiddleheads should be discarded.   Fiddleheads should also be boiled or steamed prior to sauteing, frying or baking.   Due to their short growing season, many people freeze fiddleheads. Be sure to use the same cooking methods when preparing fiddleheads that have been frozen.   Preserving fiddleheads with a pressure canner is not recommended, as safe process times have not been established for home-preserved fiddleheads.  Symptoms of illness usually begin 30 minutes to 12 hours after eating raw or undercooked fiddleheads and may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and headaches, Health Canada says. Illness generally lasts less than 24 hours but can result in dehydration, particularly among the elderly and in infants. There have been no reported cases of illness associated with eating fully cooked fiddleheads.  Anyone experiencing symptoms after eating fiddleheads should consult a health-care professional and contact their local public health unit."
688105,i2cool2fool,2012-04-18 22:14:00,349,I was born and raised in NB and have eaten my fair share. Tasty treats.   The signs in NB from the highway indicate the scenic route for the lower Saint John River Valley. Nice drive I your not in a hurry.
688192,monsterfish,2012-04-19 00:54:00,48,"I got some today, but they should be up in full by this weekend!"
689403,icefisherman,2012-04-22 23:42:00,952,"HI gUYS,  Never done it before but was encouraged by your posts and went searching for fiddleheads today along the local river. Much to my own surprise I found them...just to make sure I didn't pick the wrong ones (some one said there are some types that are bad and cancerogen). So here are few shots of what I picked up...would appreciate someone more experienced to confirm they are the ""good ones"". There were many of them in different stages of growth....left 2-3 per each old plant so they can still sustain themselves. What would be best way to cook them or should I try different ways?  Here are the shots:          Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
689413,Fisherman,2012-04-23 00:12:00,7201,"Second picture shows multiple fiddleheads from one plant, these are the ones you want.  Bracken Ferns are single shoots."
689423,turtle,2012-04-23 00:50:00,274,The ostrich fern has a grooved stem.  Your photos look like the right kind.  I picked some Saturday.  Still more to go but some are already too far grown.  I like to pick them right when they are just starting at the root clump.
689505,nancur373,2012-04-23 14:01:00,1211,Can't wait to try some of these guys in the fall.  
683794,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-05 01:15:00,2582,Brian I checked my garden...my asparagus is just poking through the ground now. Generally that means 3-4 days until harvest so I would say go fiddlehead hunting this weekend or early next week.
683823,young_one,2012-04-05 02:54:00,620,"I only eat the stinging nettles when they are less than 2 inches. Always boil them in water first. ""Stinging nettle has a flavour similar to spinach when cooked and is rich in vitamins A, C, iron, potassium, manganese, and calcium."" wiki"
683842,Sinker,2012-04-05 04:36:00,8692, Interesting. I've never heard of that before.  I know a few good nettle patches that i owe revenge on! I might have to check it out!  S.

684441,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-07 00:45:00,2582, Brian the advice I gave you was based on a typical spring...this is not it. I checked my asparagus again this afternoon. It has not grown at all. Usually when it is ready to go it grows 1-2 inches a day. But typically that is the end of April/First of May and the daytime highs are 16-24 and overnight lows are 6-10. Right now we are getting single digits  for highs and below freezing for lows...so it will slow things down for sure.
