693728,Stoty,2012-05-07 03:46:00,2910,"With Quinte... there is no ""normal"". You either kill them... or get wind/sun burnt trying! The joys of a large body of water! lol"
693742,Garnet,2012-05-07 10:37:00,2056,We whack the crap out of the pike biggest was 12 +- didn't land it. My arms still feel weak today.
693923,tizfun,2012-05-07 19:09:00,292,"We started out day in Telegraph Narrows. Spent about 5 hours with nothing.. Didn't see anyone catching at all. Boated down to Shermans Point, a boatload of boats here and didn't see any action here either.. Fished here for about an hour and left deeper into Hay Bay.. At 3:00pm the fishing began, one fish after another for the next hour or so.. We managed 17 walleye and 3 sheephead.. Biggest 2 were around 22 inches and the rest all between 13-17 inches... Kept 4 for dinner and then made our way back to the launch..  So after 7 hours of nothing we got lucky the next 2... So glad we made the moves..  Tiz"
693958,206,2012-05-07 20:29:00,563,"Fished wellers bay campgroud tourny...1 small eye 1 small pike and a hand full of OSB. saw plenty of guys with 6-8lbs fish, not sure what there secrets were lol  also came across the biggest gar I've ever seen pushing 4foot i swear!"
694070,Mike the Pike,2012-05-08 01:26:00,3421,Not a banner year for me.  I don't bother with worm harnesses during the tournament as I know I could catch more.Not many large fish caught this way but it does happen.  Barely slept all weekend fished and fished and fished.  Only managed to catch a 3 lb eater and a wee 3 lb pike.  was cold out there but the Mustang survival suit is worth every cent.  The full moon was so bright Saturday night one could read a book out there.  For me its all about getting out there and relaxing.Fish are just a bonus.  I feel good.  Until next year.....Um I mean May 24th I am sure it will be better then.  MTP
694095,fishhunter,2012-05-08 02:02:00,604,Was a Very hard opener. With lots of changing to find a lure and color they wanted we managed 13 sat. Sunday was even harder with only one fish for 7 hours of fishing.
694096,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 02:04:00,4661,glad i stayed home...
694100,Mike the Pike,2012-05-08 02:10:00,3421,  Was cold too Mike

694114,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-08 02:29:00,535,"I was out there again this morning for about 5 hours and only got 1 perch, I thought Sat was slow! Today was brutal, just soft little nibbles (when there was anything at all) and only 1 fish caught. It was really nice out there today though, gorgeous day."
694162,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 11:04:00,4661, I meant stayed on my home water...  Too sick to fish all weekend but made it out for a bit yesterday afternoon... 16 walleye in 6 hours...
694230,LeXXington,2012-05-08 14:30:00,1928,"Was out early Sat tried going for the big ones but it was to windy changed up and moved in  close ended up with a nice small pike.  Sunday great day on the water, nice 3 lb walleye and a bunch of sheep.  Nice to be on the water...  little chilly at night"
694275,walleyemen,2012-05-08 16:38:00,316,"We did o.k, about 12 but didn,t have a fish until sunday night, shermans was a bust all weekend, they just weren,t bitting there, we fished sunken island and managed 12, all our bigger fish came shallow 5-10 feet."
694314,fishhunter,2012-05-08 18:43:00,604, NICE AND WARM ON MY BOAT LOL

692385,Joeytier,2012-05-02 23:59:00,3990,"I'll be on the bay, but much farther east, hopefully away from much of derby crowd.  Good luck, guys!  Would be cool to see an OFC member grab the title."
692434,Hooked,2012-05-03 02:42:00,891,I'll be up there after a 2 year absence.  Looking forward to it!  I'll be doing the night shift while I'm there so I'll likely miss out seeing you guys....literally.   Good luck all.
692437,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-03 02:49:00,535,I'm not entering the derby but I'll be fishing the bay for the 1st time Sat.What time does the rush to launch start? I imagine it's very very early.
692459,Stoty,2012-05-03 04:36:00,2910, I'm def not in the boat you're thinking about...that company no longer exists!
692527,walleyemen,2012-05-03 13:22:00,316,"we are on 305 south shore road< not far from pickeral park, private cottage ,there will be a lund with us as well, white johnson motor i shouldn,t be hard to find, lots of beers! "

692593,LeXXington,2012-05-03 16:03:00,1928,"I will be there as usual with my new first-mate in training.  LLoyd don't cut the rope attach to my boat until you arrive on the big fish.  See you all on the Water, stay safe, and have some manners.."

692728,superdad,2012-05-03 21:45:00,353,Hey Mike - we'll be out on Saturday AM around 0715 leaving Hay Bay and headed for the fishing grounds  Using Channel 71 if you have a radio - give the Superdad a shout.  PS The colour of the canvas is now a royal blue - I can't change this darned pix.
693082,mercman,2012-05-04 20:50:00,7054,Good Luck out there guys.Stay safe and post the pics when its over!!!
693399,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-06 01:48:00,535,"Was out with my brother for about 6 hours this morning. Caught quite a few little perch but my brother caught the only walleye which was a little over 17.5"". Had a tough time locating any active fish at first, also didn't realize how shallow the Bay is in general (I launched and fished around Belleville). The boat traffic wasn't half as bad as I was expecting.    Going back there Monday, gotta put some time in and learn the area, it can be a bit overwhelming at first. I was going to try a bit for pike but I couldn't find any healthy weed beds to work, at least nothing substantial."
693597,archer379,2012-05-06 20:53:00,277,We fished west of the big bridge by telegraph narrows a lot of traffic only managed 2 most people we talked to said it was hard going a lot of people went home empty handed
693646,Joeytier,2012-05-06 23:53:00,3990,"Same story here.  Managed two (18 and 24 inches) in about 7 hours fishing, and everyone I talked to at the Belleville launched blanked.  Both fish came out of new cabbage beds in 8 to 10 FOW jigging paddle tail grubs.  Things will only get better in the next couple weeks."
693675,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-07 01:03:00,535, That makes me feel better about only getting 1 in the boat. I only saw 1 other boat catch a fish though I tried to stay away from the crowds.
693681,Hooked,2012-05-07 01:24:00,891,"Was hoping with that moon over the weekend the fishing would of been amazing, unfortunately not for us.  I managed 3 the first night, biggest being 6.4lbs (24.5"").  Second night only 2, biggest 22.5"".  But that one on the second night fought excellent, was impressed.  Appears several other suffered a slow weekend as well."
693711,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-07 02:24:00,535,"What's a ""normal"" spring day for Quinte walleye?"
