This recipe is simple and forgiving, perfect for us camp chefs in the bush  For 8 hungry fishermen  Ingredients: 2 -17"" walleyes, filleted and diced into 1/2 cubes or so 6 or 7 cans of cream of potato soup 1# bacon 1 or 2 large onions diced 5 or 6 stalks celery diced Heavy cream or 1/2 & 1/2 or milk Tobassco  Cook the bacon crisp and set aside.  Retain half of the grease and put into the camp pot.   First throw the diced celery and cook down about 2 minutes and then throw in the onion and cook down a bit more.  (Not quite clear)  Add the cubed walleye and cut the heat some.  At this point a beer is highly recommended.  Put all the canned soup in and use your cream to clean out the remnants left in the can.  I often use the cream 1/2 & 1/2 and milk as not to stress the supply of my dairy.  Crumble the bacon and toss in.  Cook this on low heat for about 15 more minutes making sure it doesn't stick too bad on the bottom of the crappy camp pot.    Give her several shots of tobassco and put the bottle on the table.  I want more. I like to garnish with green onion on top of each bowl served. Enjoy.  Man o man it just doesn't get any better."

693904,Roy,2012-05-07 18:23:00,13728,Sounds great. I hope you washed your fingers first eh?
693906,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 18:28:00,336,Maybe    Lol
693908,kickingfrog,2012-05-07 18:31:00,8333,"My preferred accompaniment is biscuits. Bisquick and milk is all you need. Easy at a cottage, bit tougher on a fly-in."

693911,NAW,2012-05-07 18:35:00,4022,"17"" Walleyes..  That's slot in G-bay.  Can I use two 16""ers?  Sounds really tasty.  I'm gunna try that this summer for sure."
693913,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 18:42:00,336," Gee, I don't know if two 16""ers will work.  Might want to play it safe and go with three 15""ers.  Thanks for the kind words."
693915,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 18:45:00,336, You are absolutely correct! Fly-in's we just go with the tube biscuits.
693919,soobnoob,2012-05-07 18:54:00,55,sounds tastey!!! now if only i could find those 2 walleyes..
693921,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 19:04:00,336, Pike works just as good.
