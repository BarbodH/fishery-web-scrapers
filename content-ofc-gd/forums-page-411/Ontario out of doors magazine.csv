693138,TDunn,2012-05-05 00:07:00,680,"I seen it too..... Very cool Ben! A dream come true Im sure!  I must also say that I have noticed alot of your work over the last 2 years.... I can  really tell you do it for the love of the sport. Which I think has been lost over the years in the fishing industry for many......More magazines need some young, fresh writers (like you and hoffman) with new ideas....  keep teaching people man,     on a side note.....wow there is alot of ofners in magazines and TV shows.... OFC`s a great place to network...  TDunn"
693217,JustinHoffman,2012-05-05 07:42:00,482,"Is a great cover for sure! Congrats to Ben - as well as to James Smedley who shot the image. Ben joins the ranks of Field Editor with the mag - a great accomplishment for a guy who genuinely loves the sport of fishing and hunting.  Thanks for the compliment, Tyler. Greatly appreciated. Have a few new projects in the works which I hope will be well received.  Good Fishing,  Justin  P.S. As a thank you to my readers, I am running a contest over on my site and giving away spools of TUF-Line fishing line! Ends tonight at midnight. Check out the ""Announcements, Contests"" section of this site for all of the details...and GOOD LUCK to the OFC'ers!"
