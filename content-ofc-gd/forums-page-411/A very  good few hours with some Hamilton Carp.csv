693502,Trevor0179,2012-05-06 17:03:00,65,Went out to Hamilton this morning Had a great time My buddy started the day day with this beauty of a mirror    Our wonderful ground bait mixture and pineapple monster corn seemed to turn up a frenzy as I ended 11 for 14 with the biggest one coming in around 17 Lbs all and all a real good time at the fish barrier   Here's two pics of the big one       And some of the other nice fish caught            Marko Had to take a picture of this the two guys beside both caught the same fish
