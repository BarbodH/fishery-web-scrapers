A couple of Steelhead rods I've now finished and ready to deliver tomorrow. Wraps were designed to match the wood work done by my friend JC ( http://www.jccustomtackle.com/ ).          The handle on a Walleye rod ready to have the winding finish put on tomorrow.    A rebuild (new blank) of a Perch rod I did a month ago using salvaged parts from the previous build, the owner broke it, his fault. Also waiting for winding finish.    And for you Irish (Wayne), winner of my donation to Mike P's Cancer auction, the handle on Leah's new spinning rod.  "
693296,misfish,2012-05-05 18:09:00,29133,"Atleast now I can say,you do great work bud.  I really like the wood finish here. Now you got me thinking of another.  "
693308,spinnerdoc,2012-05-05 18:58:00,556,AWESOME work as always. On the wooden reel seats does the metal part get cut off then the wood slide inside the threaded tube?
693314,l2p,2012-05-05 19:45:00,346,Beauties
693316,Joey,2012-05-05 19:48:00,9122,Them's real purdy Chris
693319,rmarentette,2012-05-05 20:02:00,124,Wow!!!!!!!! True craftsmanship. Beautiful work!
693428,Spiel,2012-05-06 11:13:00,9065,"Thanks all.   Any time Brian, you know where to find me.   No Edwin, the hardware is purchased that way (example ), many size and colour options available then the wood is turned to fit."
693432,solopaddler,2012-05-06 11:24:00,8605," Well actually...many times J.C. cut the metal barrel out of a standard aluminum reel seet, then turned wood to fit.  And yes regardless of whether it's a skeleton seat or not the wood is turned down so that it slides inside the metal reel seat fittings.   Pretty incredible work as per usual! The green dyed wood looks great. Wish I had a matching wood winding check on mine. Next build for sure."
693434,Spiel,2012-05-06 11:35:00,9065," True, it can be done and I've done it too, just easier to by skeleton hardware.  Next build, I'd of thought you had enough rods already."
693435,solopaddler,2012-05-06 11:44:00,8605,"  The amount of anodized colors available in standard aluminum reel seats compared to skeleton is huge.  Your buddy up in Caledonia has cut hundreds, mostly because what he wanted wasn't available in a skeleton seat.  And no I never have enough rods."
693454,spinnerdoc,2012-05-06 12:53:00,556,"That's funny you say that Solo, I bought a breatheable waders from Bondar on the board and guess whats in the back of his truck? One of your earlier Cts  Spiel,thanks for the link, I've always thought they were cut. And if they were do you treat the cut ends with something? I have bare aluminum on some parts of my reel and they start to corrode. Also the ring at the end of the threaded part by the locking nuts, they purchased separately?"
693458,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-06 13:00:00,2690,Beautiful stuff Chris. I'll have to save some pennies and dimes...or maybe a certain member on your team might want to order one down the road for her fishing buddy
693467,lew,2012-05-06 13:29:00,12766,Lotsa real nice work there Chris !!
