693309,Acountdeleted,2012-05-05 19:00:00,2562,Next weekend for Walleye opener I was thinking of taking my canoe to Rice lake for some early morning fishing. I'll be coming from Peterborough as I'm visiting with a friend for her house warming. The problem that I'm having is that every website that I look at that describes Rice Lakes boat launches don't say weather a launch is public or at a Marina. I figure if I can save a few bucks and use a public one (or even toss my canoe in at a public park) I would do that. But I don't want to be driving around for 2 hours just to save a few bucks.  Can someone give me some advice?  
693321,ld17,2012-05-05 20:07:00,319,Gores landing is 5 bucks.  Nice launch and facilities.  Give them a call to make sure the price is still the same.  Well worth the peace of mind for the parking.  If you ask around the area there is a free launch but I don't remember the road.  It will accommodate your canoe just fine if you don't want to pay the 5 bucks.

I can remember years ago putting in a friends 12 foot tinner at a free little launch somewhere on the North side of the Lake but I have no idea where. I plan on launching at the free launch at the bottom of wood duck drive off county road 2. I have no idea if it will prove to be a good spot. Ron, if you'd care to share the wealth with me too that would be great, if not, that's cool too."

693400,gaspumper,2012-05-06 01:56:00,393,"There is a good launch at the Hiawatha First Nation,a donation box is set up."
693404,Ron,2012-05-06 02:04:00,1683,"Sorry guys, got called away on a water leak.  Give me a few minutes to set one up."
693408,Ron,2012-05-06 02:23:00,1683,http://g.co/maps/5pqdy  These are the few I know of.
693409,Dutch,2012-05-06 02:26:00,831,"Campbelltown - on the Otonabee, couple of k.m.s from the lake.  Keene - again, couple of k.m.s from the lake.  Birdsalls - east end near ouse river.  Hiawatha - mid-lake near the sunken rail line.  Probably your best bet."
693418,Weeds,2012-05-06 03:26:00,782,"Thanks Ron, that's great! You too Dutch."

693632,Garnet,2012-05-06 23:15:00,2056,The only 1 ron missed is downtown Keene turn left at lights about 200 ft on right. Doesn't matter for you in canoe but a boat you will need to turn right don't go straight.  The best for canoe walleye is Pengallie or Hiawatha.
