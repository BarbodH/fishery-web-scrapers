693430,Canitalian,2012-05-06 11:20:00,75,I was trying to post pics through my iPhone but can't seem to figure out how. Any suggestions?
693439,dave524,2012-05-06 12:24:00,4508,A top water popper when bass are out of season is not a good lure choice. Good luck on posting the pic of the perch.
693448,Christopheraaron,2012-05-06 12:42:00,3525," It wouldn't be a good choice if you caught a bass with it and kept fishing that lure, next weekend lots of people will be throwing them for walleye and pike."
693461,Canitalian,2012-05-06 13:02:00,75,"Ya i guess your right RHF, I wasn't trying for it at all though, I went looking for Pike because I heard it was open as of May 1st. Tried various spinnerbaits with no luck whatsoever. Any suggestions ? Hoping to go out again today. Email me if you prefer that instead. [emailÂ protected]"
693465,Canitalian,2012-05-06 13:19:00,75,Anyone know how to upload pics from iPhone to mobile OFC site? Please help.
693478,dave524,2012-05-06 14:41:00,4508, Pretty sure the pike are OOS too. Stick with the panfish population for now. Number 4 and 5 Mepps spinners work good once pike season opens.
693479,pics,2012-05-06 14:49:00,1268,Pike are closed on Niapenco until May 12.....
693480,Christopheraaron,2012-05-06 14:50:00,3525, Already sent him a PM about it..
693488,Canitalian,2012-05-06 15:40:00,75,"I'm telling you guys, I was told they allowed pile fishing as of May 1st. Catch and release only of course."
693489,Christopheraaron,2012-05-06 15:41:00,3525,"Just curious, who told you?"
693490,woodenboater,2012-05-06 15:48:00,2277,"Nope, regs say 2nd sat in May which is May 12 as pics posted above. Couldn't find any exceptions in the guide. Believe the regs, not someone's word."
693491,Christopheraaron,2012-05-06 15:51:00,3525,"I really wonder who is spreading this rumour, there have been a few instances where people have heard of this made up exception."
693493,Canitalian,2012-05-06 16:04:00,75,Maybe you should call them and find out for sure. 905-692-3228
693494,dave524,2012-05-06 16:14:00,4508,"The confusion is that it is a designated fish sanctuary, C and R for bass , pike and walleye, BUT !!!! the open seasons still apply for targeting those species."
693495,Christopheraaron,2012-05-06 16:34:00,3525," that makes more sense, not like any sane person would eat out of there anyways!"
693499,Canitalian,2012-05-06 16:46:00,75,For sure. I know that next Sat is the opener for Pike and Walleye . Can't wait.
693527,Fish Farmer,2012-05-06 18:07:00,2234,Crappie derby there this sat. Tons of Crappies to be caught.
693529,Canitalian,2012-05-06 18:10:00,75,Hope to be there with my 4 yr old Boy. S/B fun stuff
