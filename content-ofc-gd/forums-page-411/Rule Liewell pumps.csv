694203,Nipfisher,2012-05-08 13:31:00,2449,"After reading Slyingm's thread about getting his ""fishing machine"" ready for this season I decided to have a good look at my ""beater"". My livewell and baitwell are filled by a Rule pump. It is a 360 GPH and is the 1st model shown in this link. Rule Pump  I tried to separtae the top red part from the white (mounted part but couldn't. Is there a trick to it?  Maybe the pump is too small for my 17' boat?  I cleaned it up and pushed water through it with the hose from both sides. My guess is it is about 4 years old and certainly had never been cleaned or serviced.  Also the way my Starcraft is designed it is a very small opening in the rear deck to access that area. It may be too difficult to get at it properly.  If it aint broke don't mess with it?"

694297,lew,2012-05-08 17:47:00,12766,In all the years I've owned boats I can honestly say I have never cleaned or done any maintenance on a bilge or livewell pump and I have never had a problem with one or had to replace one.  Maybe that's not what you wanted to hear but that's all I can offer
