693741,Machine57,2012-05-07 10:27:00,22,"Looking at booking a week long trip to Washington DC in August for our Anniversary. Going to fly out of Buffalo. What I am thinking is fly into DC, and use their transit system to get around. Arlington, White House, Smithsonian, ect..ect..We love to walk alot, so walking 10-12 blocks to get to an attraction is not a problem. I have been looking on Hotwire for Hotels, but the amount is almost overwhelming. My question, Has anyone stayed there and if so, can you enlighten me with reviews as to the hotel you stayed in, good or bad..ect. Do I fly into Ronald Regan or Dulles(sp??). If you wish to respond @ PM please do so I am not clogging up the board. Thanks Guys!! Dan"
