693984,misfish,2012-05-07 21:25:00,29133,"Steve, you get into some great fish and you are a great young fisherman. Myself,I would like to hear commentary instead of the music. Like what you are looking for,tips,baits,setups and so on, during your vid. Your obvisouly not worried about where you are fishing. And no, I don,t care where.   JMO"
694011,Moosebunk,2012-05-07 22:42:00,3970,What Misfish said!!!  15-20 years ago my pants were lower than yours and my chain wallet was to the knees... and our hip hop and rap was better.  What you got going on though is the fishing.  Solid craps again.
694012,tb4me,2012-05-07 22:44:00,3295,"Cool fishin, but I too had to kill it early due to music.."
694014,Dan668,2012-05-07 22:52:00,1120,"Nice fish. Nothing wrong with the music lol, just throw her on mute if it bothers you."
694022,steverowbotham,2012-05-07 23:30:00,1800,"I just picked a song on the playlist that was the same length as the video haha.  Musical tastes will always vary, but thanks for the input.  And yes the pants issue comes out to play again.  I've always been bad for it, but especially since losing 60lbs and not fully updating the wardrobe.  Ah well. haha"
694082,monsterfish,2012-05-08 01:42:00,48,"Nice fish Steve! And a great video!  I too found some Crappies yesterday, it was a beauty day to be out!"

694089,Christopheraaron,2012-05-08 01:57:00,3525,Song was too much for me as well  but once it was muted no complaints with that kind of fishing!
