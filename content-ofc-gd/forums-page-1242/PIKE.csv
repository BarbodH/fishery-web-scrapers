54604,Hellfish,2007-04-03 00:48:00,308,"First of all started the day going to the dentist to get my mouth ripped apart then came hme and laid down for a bit, was a little sceptical to go out today clouds were rolling in a lil bit of thunder but no prob, i was just going out to chuck a couple Husky jerks. Stopped by Denis shop for a qucik chat and headed out to the spot. I arrived and to my avail no one was there and it was free of ice. The water was a lil cloudy at times but and and all was alright. broke out the new casting combo and tied a rip off of a lucky craft lure on and MAN was it the right choice, also a really nice older gentleman came and tied up luckily he had a net. So for the first 45 mins no action then the sun came out and it was nearing 4:00 then the pike turned on hit one lost 2 hit another one lost one hit 2 more thne lost maybe another 2 or 3 the action was HOT the older gentleman hit another 3 pike and missed 1 i think, the lure of choice was the rip off,husky jerks didnt produce anything only the rip offs did. ended up leaving around 6:00 as it was starting to get packed there, all and all very satisfied about how the day went. the largest one was 30 inches and the smallest was 25 inches.  Biggest of the day    Smaller one  http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t43/Hellfish66/small.jpg  and the 3 i kept all posing happily together.    Sorry if it wasnt too exciting but itz better than nothing BTW prolly the best day of fishing ive had yet this year. Also the fish look a heck of alot smaller in the pics then they do in real life LOL, I guess keep in mind im 6'2 270lbs just for a lil comparison."

54611,Rich Clemens,2007-04-03 00:57:00,3131,Sure sounds like you had some good action there to keep things interesting.  I'd be satisfied with an afternoon like that.  Nice job and thanks for sharing your trip ... great to see reports such as these.

54643,Zib,2007-04-03 01:52:00,369,What was the name of the Lucky Craft knock offs? Where can you buy them? Any links to by them online?  Thanks
54648,Bernie,2007-04-03 01:59:00,3190,Nice catch there Hellfish..Gonna be good on the Team 3 Fin Chasers list as well as your BBQ.
54651,GbayGiant,2007-04-03 02:05:00,1780,"Sounds like Heven and He11 to me, first getting drills and needles in your mouth than doing a little dental work of your own on those pike.   The day started bad, ended good."
54675,Hellfish,2007-04-03 02:56:00,308,"Clampet, bacon wrapped pike on the bbq is something outta this world, u have to get into some cold water pike (better tasting then warm water and the meat is a much better texture), make them kind in shape as hamburgers or London Broils and do that up sweetly u will not regret it I promise. Zib ill check in the morning what the name is, Denis shop in Fort Erie its called Fishin Niagara u has alot of them, ill snap a quick pic for you and pm it to.  Nippising I hope we can get into some bigger ones if we hit up ur place in the summer those were just teasers   . The day def didnt start out ideally i must say but ur right Gbaygiant couldnt have ended any better."
54683,jediangler,2007-04-03 03:51:00,1923,Where you fishing that pike was still open? I thought most of Ontario was closed to pike fishing as of the end of March.
54722,ccmtcanada,2007-04-03 11:47:00,7971,Pike are open all year on Lake Erie...as well as the Niagara River upstream from Niagara Falls.
54727,Hellfish,2007-04-03 11:55:00,308,  exactly i was fishing the Niagara river inland waters
