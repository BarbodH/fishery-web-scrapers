54155,misfish,2007-04-01 22:57:00,29133,Sorry wrong link at first try.  
54158,misfish,2007-04-01 23:06:00,29133,Link is there now
54159,GbayGiant,2007-04-01 23:08:00,1780,"They look nice, they already make boats might as well have a bass boat in the line up."
54164,misfish,2007-04-01 23:16:00,29133,"It does look like a sweet machine,time on the water will only tell."
54180,fishindevil,2007-04-01 23:46:00,6254,"Nice looking bass boat   no doubt about it,but like you said brian time will tell,and im sure the guys who are ranger fans will have alot to say about it, LUND is also going to build fiberglass boats as well and will be bringing out boats that will look very simular, well its a very competetive boat market out there and everyone wants a piece of the bass boat pie  ,and hey lets face it competition is good and should result in the copanies making better boats and also bringing down the prices....ye-hhaaaaaa....cheers"
54190,silveradosheriff,2007-04-01 23:56:00,1025,Does it come with a 40hp?
54197,Sinker,2007-04-02 00:03:00,8692,  
54199,GbayGiant,2007-04-02 00:05:00,1780," Bass boats only come with 200hp minimum silly.  A 40hp bass boat would be similar to seeing a horse and carriage on Young street, all though you might see a few pilgrims now and again. lol."
54203,easton13th,2007-04-02 00:08:00,371,Not the same as the Legend Canadian manufacturer.  BUT what a sweet ride. http://www.ridewithalegend.com/
54233,taper,2007-04-02 00:58:00,611, If it's any thing like all the other Legend ads they will advertise it for a great price but way under powered.
54236,charlesn,2007-04-02 01:05:00,551,"The Legend bass boat line is different than the Legend aluminum line.  Baysville Marina on Lake of the Bays had a beautiful Legend at the Toronto Sportsmans Show.  Gary Yamamoto is sponsored by Legend and it is a John Storie boat (Champion, then Cobra, then Legend).  Storie is known for building great riding bass boats.  The best riding bass boats in the industry usually.  Had a chance to check out the Legend, it was very nice.  I will consider it for my next boat.  Charles"
54253,bigfish1965,2007-04-02 01:37:00,3382,I totally see a lawsuit coming....
54274,GbayGiant,2007-04-02 02:40:00,1780,"Damn, I thought it was the Canadian company too.   I here ya, but even if it was the Canadian Legend they would even have a 60 hp on it, lol.."
54391,misfish,2007-04-02 13:10:00,29133,"Charles, was there a price listed ?"
54393,charlesn,2007-04-02 13:21:00,551,"Yes, with the 225 Pro XS bad boy that was on her and all the ""trimmings"" it was $55,000.  The base price is $48,000 with standard 225 opti.  That was their flagship 21 footer, they make smaller models.  Charles"
