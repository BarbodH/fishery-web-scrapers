Gotta say it felt GREAT to be out there on the water again after several long months of fishlessness.  Didn't go nuts as it was a dusk mission but we did manage to sneak in a little action before dark.  I was trolling my favorite shad rap and lost a couple good fish (too eager, rusty, improper hook sets).  Finally laid into what seemed like a decent fish and after a brief tussle was surprised to see this little sheepie come aboard.  Quick CPR.     Hung in for a short while longer as we pushed it until dark and was rewarded with this little brown before we called it quits.    Overall, it was short and sweet but felt GREAT to get out on the water again in 07.  ALL OPENERS CANNOT COME SOON ENOUGH!!!!!"
