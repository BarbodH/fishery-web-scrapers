I want to do it myself, I like my rods, just this little annoyance.  SO.....  Where in the GTA (prefreably west) do I find rod building supplies. I would need thread, epoxy, hook keepers, & any advice I can get.  I think I can do it myself just don't know where to find supplies and ask some questions.  Thanks"
54078,Harv,2007-04-01 20:07:00,19,I don't know where to buy supplies in GTA since I don't live there but I do know of lots of places to buy everything you would need on-line.  If that interests you shoot me a message and I will send you some links.  [emailÂ protected]   HARV

54785,mdej,2007-04-03 14:10:00,98, Thanks.  Never heard of this store till now and its not far from my house.  I think I will go talk to them and give it a shot.  I mean its only a hook keeper so it if breaks the world will not end.  Just have to figure out the loop to finish the knot.
