54334,OhioFisherman,2007-04-02 10:13:00,6623,"They are incidental catches for me, my biggest has been around 35 pounds, on 8# test line early in April on a tube fishing for smallies. I have mellowed a bit over the years, we used to remove carp and sheephead from the line with a fish billyclub. Some people like to catch them and or eat them so I release them now, but I don`t like them."
54392,Photoz,2007-04-02 13:14:00,792,"About 6 years ago I was bored between the trout run & the salmon coming back, no boat for bass or pickerel  . . . .    so a pal suggested I go after carp with him. EW W W W  W   W? Carp? Hell, I heard it's just like hooking an old sunken piece of driftwood! He just grinned and said if I went, I was in for a real treat. We pulled up at Lakeview (the former generating plant) and walked over to the boardwalk, where there was a couple dozen people set up. All of a sudden I heard a shrill 'beeping' sound then a high pitched scream . . . .     and a guy makes a dive for his rod! He sets the hook, and line is peeling out so fast it almost smoked the reel up. WOW! This guy must have a big salmon on? After about 10 minutes, in comes about a 12  -  15 pound 'whistling salmon,' a k a carp! We had pretty primitine gear for carp . . .    I had a 10.5' Fenwick and a 2000 Stradic, with 8 pound line . . . .     I loaded my hook up with canned (DelMonte Summer Crisp) corn, cast it out, and laid my rod on the boardwalk, but was cauitioned I should hang onto it! About 15 minutes later I found out why . . .   no tap, or little poke, all of a sudden my rod nearly got yanked outta my hand. About 20 minutes later, a carp just under 20 pounds was netted for me! I WAS TOTALLY HOOKED! I now have several carp rods & reels, buzzers & pod, and the rest of the toys that go with it. Although I never keep carp, if someone asks me for one I've caught, I'll ask what he plans to do with it . . .     if it's 'for the rose bushes,' not a chance . . . .    if it's for the table . . . .    no problem. I had an Estonian gentleman on my route cook a piece for me a couple years ago, after I gave him a couple. Barbecued over charcoal, with some herbs & spices . . . .   deeeeeelicious . . .     firm flesh, much like bass! I use barbless hooks, and if I can 'beach' my carp, I will, and just pull the hook . . .     and away he goes. The one shown in my avatar was caught at the mouth of the Credit last April, just under 35 pounds . . .     sure made my reel sing. I call carp 'the poor man's muskie,' for under $100.00, a TTC ticket & the price of a can of corn, ANYBODY gets a chance at hauling in a 40+ pound fish! At risk of boring those of you who have already read this article, I'll post it again in case there might be SOMEONE who is interested.This is taken from a board that listed the World Championship Of Carp Fishing,' held on the St. Lawrence River between Ogdensberg & Mesina, New York in 2005 . . .    first ever tournament held in North America.  HISTORY OF CARP IN THE UNITED STATES  Prior to 1900, most native fish were viewed as vital food resources. Fish designated as sport fish today were harvested commercially and shipped by rail to the cities. The results were gravely declining stocks of river and lake fish at a time the U.S. population was greatly expanding.  In 1871, Ulysses S. Grant and Congress ordered the formation of the U.S. Fish Commission to oversee the nation's fisheries interests. By 1877 the studies of European fish farming techniques indicated the carp would contribute to the strength of the nation.  By 1874, the commission after long study issued a report entitled, ""Fishes Especially worthy of Cultivation.""  It went on to say that no other species except the carp promises so great a return in limited waters. Cited were advantages over such fish as black bass, trout, grayling and others ""because it is a vegetable feeder, and although not disdaining animal matters can live on vegetation alone and can attain large weight kept in small ponds and tanks.""  In 1876, the commission enumerated other good qualities such as high fecundity (a count of ripe eggs in the female fish), adaptability to artificial propagation, hardiness of growth, adaptability to environmental conditions unfavorable to equally palatable species, rapid growth, harmlessness in relation to fish of other species, ability to populate waters to it's greatest extent and fine table qualities.  By 1877, citing the above reasons and adding, 'there is no reason why time should be lost with less proved fishes,"" the commission, convinced of the value of carp, imported 345 fishes of scaled, mirror and leather carp from German aqua culturists.  On May 26th, they were placed in the Druid Hill Park ponds in Baltimore, Maryland.  The ponds proved inadequate and some were transferred to the Babcock lakes on the monument lot in Washington, D.C. the following year.  So did they somehow escape from these confines to populate nearly everywhere?  No.  Now state governments get involved.  Records indicate about 6,203 fingerlings were produced in the Babcock lakes in 1879.  These were shipped to 273 applicants in 24 states.  About 6,000 fingerlings were produced in the Druid Hill ponds that year and were stocked primarily in Maryland.  One year later, 31,332 carp were shipped to 1,374 applicants.  In 1882, carp production increased to 143,696 fish and distributed in small lots to 7,000 applicants.  In 1883, about 260,000 carp were sent to 9,872 applicants in 298 of 301 congressional districts and to 1,478 counties.  During the years 1879 to 1896, the U.S. Fish Commission distributed 2.4 million carp, some of which were sent to Canada, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico.  By 1897, the Commission discontinued the stocking because carp had been distributed nearly everywhere and many states assumed the task of propagation and stocking of carp."

That's a lot of money invovled. Also, in the southern states pay lakes are a big thing where you pay to fish some stocked pond with chance to win some money. Sort of like horse racing but you catch fish to win.  For me, I just like the power of the fight and the tactics to fool these fish. And unlink a lot of other carpers I don't think keeping carp is that bad although I have not kept any. I really don't mind if you don't care to try it, just more fish for me.  PS: the pod in my background is Photoz's, that picture was taken on the day he gave me the first carp tutor. I believe a lot of carpers on this site have been helped by him directly or indirectly. Hats off to Steve!"
54694,pikehunter,2007-04-03 07:44:00,1659,"Carp, the new game fish. Think I'm nuts? Just look at how the worlds fish stocks have been depleted and you will see. I have only caught them by accident and never kept any for the table or the garden.  When I was growing up we had a European born neighbour who fished Bronte Creek every Sunday. He always came home with a carp or 2 that were destined for the strawberry crop. He had the most amazing garden on the block."
54702,Big Cliff,2007-04-03 10:35:00,6899,"I don't know why any cottagers wouldn't want carp around, all they do is eat weeds and help to keep your waterfront clean. I even feed them from ice out until late into the fall.  From time to time the grandkids will come and fish for them and I have a few friends that like to sit on my dock and spend a few hours trying to hook into one. If someone wanted to keep one for the table that would be fine with me but to date most have just been released to fight another day. Biggest one landed so far, 27 lbs but I have seen bigger ones crusing just off the dock.  As for eating them.... can't comment much on that, I did smoke one many years ago and it wasn't too bad."
