Reason I was only out for 20 minutes...well I fell in while landing this 29 inch BEAUTY and wasnt wearing waders.  Here she is!  sit...SIT...STAY!       Yes, it is bleeding and did not have a chance to make it, the fish rolled about 20 times and I had to cut the line out of its gills. With the amount it was bleeding I knew there was no chance for it so I brought it home. Hes in the freezer for now, im not too sure what Im going to do with it but by leaving it we get into the whole ""wasting a fish"" regs business. I hate killing these fish but *hit happens. Picture is terrible quality, really is a pretty fish too."

54595,ccmtcanada,2007-04-03 00:27:00,7971,Nice job Kemper!  I knew you'd start posting some great results as you got out more and more.  Congrats!
54618,kemper,2007-04-03 01:02:00,2232,"Thanks CC, Ive been trout fishin since a was knee high to a grasshopper but its always been with my dad, after the opener. Now that Im able to drive myself around its been a tough go last winter and this spring because fishing in the cold weather is (at least for me) a totally new sport. Wait till the water warms up and the season opens, then youll see some REAL results from me!  haha, tightlines"
