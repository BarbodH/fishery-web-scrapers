53812,tbayboy,2007-03-31 23:06:00,1497,"Yesterday I saw PatrickGs post saying that he was heading out to the islands today and wanting to be just like all the other cool kids I dropped him a line and this morning the two of hopped on the ferry at 9:30 am.  Right off I want to say thanks to PatrickG - great guy to hang around with and had lots of great tips as this was my first time to the islands.  He also came in rather handy later on in the day but first lets start with our first action of the day:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/205/441227920_83b266024b_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Big stick"" /></a>  And the release:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/441230251_5c998dc960_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""The release"" /></a>  The next several hours can be summed up as SKUNK but I prefer the following detailed description:  Walk, cast, cast cast, change lures, cast, cast, change lures, cast, cast, grumble under breath.  And repeat for a few hours.  At one point Patrick looked over and said I'm going old school and pulled a red devil spoon out of his box.  I matched him a 5 of diamonds yellow/red spoon.  At that point we knew we were done and headed back.  On the way we decided to take one more stab at promising spot we'd tried earlier.  I put on a perch patterned 4"" rapala, tossied it out and started slow retrieves - jerk, jerk, pause 5 seconds, etc.  Second cast and boom my lines moving away from me in a hurry.  With a triumphant 'Hot damn' I let Patrick know we'd beaten the skunk.  After a fun little fight and an awesome landing job by Patrickthis nice girl made our day:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/189/441257551_c5c42deae4_o.png"" width=""763"" height=""1278"" alt=""hiddenloc"" /></a>  Sorry for the photo editing but hey, its more fun if you put in the miles yourself right?  We quickly put her back in the water and she swam away for another days fight but we forgot to get a tape on her (I think its a her as it was really fat so probably a near spawn female) but judging from the pic and measuring my arms after it looks about 32"" (and about 10 lbs).  Damn did that ever put us in a good mood.  Suddenly we figured we could catch the next boat instead and started throwing again.  Unfortunately that was to be the only fish landed - we had a few follows and a big one spat Patricks rapala back in his face but nothing else landed.  Once again, big thanks to PatrickG for showing me around, can't wait til May to try again."
