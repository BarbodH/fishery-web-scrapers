54748,krawler,2007-04-03 13:11:00,167,"99 % sold on a lund.  as i was looking into the deal i asked the dealer about the length of the shaft and he said it was 20"".  I always thought to go with the longer shaft length.  The motor is a yamaha 75 hp comes in both 25"" and 20"" shaft.  Is 20"" sufficient??  How do i know which length to choose?  thanks"
54755,Nemo,2007-04-03 13:23:00,727,Depend on the depth of the transom. Basically you want enough of the prop in the water to push the boat without cavitating. And also you don't want too much in because it causes drag.

54761,Terry,2007-04-03 13:28:00,14456,the dealer will know the correct shaft length for that boat and that is what you should go with..too long will cause problems as will too short...
54774,krawler,2007-04-03 13:49:00,167,"20"" length will do!!  thanks for the info. now all i have to do is wait 2 months for the boat to arrive.  countdown begins.   krawler"
