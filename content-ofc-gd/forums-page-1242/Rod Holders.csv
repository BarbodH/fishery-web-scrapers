54460,moosehead,2007-04-02 18:51:00,90,"I am in the market for some rod holders for my new boat, main use will be for my dipsy rods. Has anyone used the scotty striker rod holders and are they strong enough for salmon fishing? I was going to go with the down east clamp ons but they will not fit my boat. I need a deck mount rod holder that i can remove easy when not in use therefore do not want to go with the down east bolt on model."
54468,Randy,2007-04-02 18:59:00,115,"Moosehead I've been looking at those ones for dipseys as well. I contacted Scotty and they said the striker would be the one in their line to be used for dipseys, but I'll be interested in what others have to say to your posting."
54471,JFR,2007-04-02 19:05:00,498,"I've been using Scotty Striker rod holders for a number of years.  Fishing muskies and pulling 14"" lures puts a lot of pressure on your equipment, and the holders will stand up.  One thing I like about the Socttys is that there are many possible bases and holders available to fit any boat.  John"
54472,moosehead,2007-04-02 19:06:00,90,"Yes hopefully somebody has used them with success for salmon fishing, i just want to make sure they will stand up to the pull of a dipsy diver and a salmon."
54473,misfish,2007-04-02 19:07:00,29133,I concur with my friend JR. They are an easy fit on any boat and work great.
54481,Headhunter,2007-04-02 19:39:00,5703,The Cabela's house brands have held up very well and are cheaper then the Scotties! HH
54487,fishindevil,2007-04-02 19:52:00,6254,"You got that right strikers are the way to go,also i use the scotty powerlocks for walleye fishing for my in-line planerboard rods,but all the great lakes salmon & trout guys use those stikers....i cant wait.  ...cheers"
54525,thecraftyprince,2007-04-02 21:33:00,37,"Invest in a set of pursuit tracks and adjustable/fixed rod holders, they even have an adapter for down easters, you won't be sorry.  www.pursuitsports.com  BPS has them, as well as some smaller tackle guys."
54550,dwc67,2007-04-02 22:32:00,140,strikers will easily hold up to a wire dipsy strike. i don't use them but some very good salmon tourny guys do
54553,express168,2007-04-02 22:38:00,327,"I have strikers on my boat, they stand up to the dipsys well but unfortunately I am new to the salmon fishing and am yet to experience the salmon strike but I think they should hold up just fine."
54606,bpcbear2000,2007-04-03 00:50:00,25,"I have used Down easters for a few years and they work great, Just lift up and it release's the rod. Can be turned any way you want it quickly"
54644,danc,2007-04-03 01:52:00,4677,"Cabelas brand rod holders here. But then again, practically everything that I use is Cabelas brand. Good quality. Good service. Good price. Good warranty. What more can you ask for??"
54674,Mike the Pike,2007-04-03 02:55:00,3421,"If thats your boat in your avatar you should consider the Double screw on rod holders from Salty#S-10.Metal not plastic,with quick release .I have 2 absolutely love them.Solid  I see alot of Muskie fisherman use them . they only fit on boats with slender gunwales.   http://www.down-east.com/clamp-on.htm"
54724,tipupesox,2007-04-03 11:49:00,167,"I have the following tube style rod holders on my boat, http://www.titelok.com/product_info.php?cP...;products_id=41 .  Use them for pulling dipsey's for walleye on Erie and salmon on Ontario.  Also use them to pull large muskie baits (plows) in the Fall.  Haven't had an issues.  Best part is you can by a few additional bases and place them in differnet locations on your boat."
54745,Fishmaster,2007-04-03 12:31:00,920,Scotty's are good ..for Salmon and Dipsy ..
54765,Slowhand,2007-04-03 13:31:00,13,Scotty Strikers are on my boat. Used them a lot w/o any problems for Muskie and Pike Trolling.
54777,moosehead,2007-04-03 13:53:00,90," No that is the old boat, new one is bigger with wider gunwales. Thanks for all the info guys"
