54035,Mike the Pike,2007-04-01 18:42:00,3421, Got out with GlennK this morning and I would have to say I was pumped up as much as an over inflated tire after reading all the CC reports(Canadian Copper)(CCMT and Bly).  I waited all week for this skunking  I have to tell ya I was determined to catch some rainbows and browns since they are the only legal fish we were allowed to catch on the St.Lawrence River for now.   GlennK and I walked down to the first location not far from the Circuit Gilles Villeneuves racetrack.We made our way down the steep shoreline and began to select our pools for casting.After about 15 minutes I get a snag and lose my new blue fox spoon blue and silver $2.99+tax errrrrrrr..Gone  Ok Yozuri time.Nothing time to move to the next location  .   I am sure some of you recognize the sphere in the background form Expo 67(Man and His World).   Next location.The far bridge in the background is the train bridge on the Victoria Bridge that runs into Montreal.    Here is where the fun started casting and trying to dodge the huge ice chunks.After catching some small ice chunks I hook in to the Goliath of icebergs one that could almost sink the Titanic without Celine Dion on board.  Anyway I hear my line just peeling away when I see what is towing my lure downstream a chunk of ice at least 4x8 feet in size 8 inches thick. Well David gets beat by Goliath and the sling shot is not going to help me now. I got spooled   after purchasing that new Flurocarbon by seaguar about 50yds $8.00 and a new Xrap from rapala $7.49+tax errrrrrrrrr  Ok by this time I am ticked but more determined so I go back to GlennK's truck and pick up the spare rod.Time for a new lacation.  Our location   Next location under the Jacques Cartier Bridge.Never realized how shallow it was here.Fish were not here they have all moved to Ontario.   New location and the Canadian coast guard roars by in there speedy hovercraft .So now I have a good excuse for being skunked they scared all the fish away.   Next location new bridge GlennK and no fish. I must admit fishing in these conditions were brutal lots of snags on floating ice .The noise of the ice chunks was music to anyones ears.It often sounded like someone stiring a giant drink with a swivel stick and lots of ice in the glass.Some times the ice smashed so hard it would scare the bejeezes out of me.     Here is 3 foot by 1 foot ice chunk I caught it pulled like a shark  .Crap!!!!!!!!!!  Taking weeds off your line is easy compared to ice.The ice would fray my line and bend the hooks on the Xraps right back.   Here is our new member GlennK.notice the net if there is one thing I have learned from those Chrome reports. Cliff because of you I made sure we brought the net.Some how I think it was bad luck.  At this point we have not quit.   This shot is for Rick (this is the Montreal Casino)   A view of the fishing conditions from above.   A view from the Jacques Cartier Bridge on the way home.  Well sorry for the lack of fish and the boring report but I thought some of you might enjoy some pics of Montreal.  Has anyone fished with this much ice flow before?Is it like this on the Tribs?  Can't wait for April 28th.  Mike The Pike

54050,Smokey,2007-04-01 19:18:00,1278,"Well at least you didn't get skunked if catching the ice counts as something, too bad about getting spooled though.  Thanks for the report."

54118,Bernie,2007-04-01 21:21:00,3190,Very well done report Mike!!   Too bad about the ice chunks and the lack of fish caught. Good day to spend with a friend like Glenn though.

54194,Motorhead,2007-04-02 00:00:00,163,"Too bad about not getting into any fish but that was a Great report, thanks for posting  Doug"
54374,Mike the Pike,2007-04-02 12:21:00,3421,  Thanks for the invite CC if I don't get a trout after the ice is gone I may give this trib fishing a try and drive up the 401 for some steel.  Thats what I like about this board always someone willing to help others.Thanks Mike
54383,ccmtcanada,2007-04-02 12:41:00,7971,"Mike...what a great report!  Sorry about the skunk too!  I get skunked quite regularly in fact...LOL.   Bly and I went steel hunting a week ago and within 30 minutes I had lost 6 leaders because of snags.  You'll notice I dont mention those in my reports...haha.  I also fished a mouth of a river before the ice had completely come from the river.  Also had to dodge ice chunks between drifts.  The first time a large sheet of ice crashed against an immovable object, it scared the crap out of me too...LOL.  Thought maybe bly had fallen in the water!!  Anyhow, keep at it...at least you had some great ice fishing results this year...I never did manage to pull in a fish on the ice."

54502,b2kptbo,2007-04-02 20:48:00,1505,"You 2 gave it a shot, too bad about the skunk, better luck next time..."
54506,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-02 20:58:00,181,Way to show some dedication! I went over the Jaque bridge when I went on a 17 hour car ride to Moncton last summer. Montreal is a nice city!
