I am from Ohio and am looking to get back to Canada for my second year. I spent a week at Rocky Island Lake 2 years ago and had a great time, but it was in July (hot!) I'm planing on going again this year in September, but if there is a better lake somewhere is the same area that is good for September I would like to try it. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, chuckj"
