Why fish 12 hours here for a handful of fish when you can drive 4, fish for 8, and catch 10 times the numbers of fish available across the border?  I haven't gone myself yet, but I plan on it in the near future.  Can you imagine that they welcome and accomodate anglers in the U.S.? we should take note.  They create more public access, rather than eliminate it (our current practice in urban Ontario)  Tony"

54520,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-02 21:21:00,181,Nice fish! Sounded like a great fishing trip!
54356,Whopper,2007-04-02 11:35:00,2174,"Mike the area that you were in is about 4 1/2 to 5 hours northeast of me. I've got a couple friends that fish up that way but have never been there myself. Besides Lake Erie and parts of the Ohio River most of our best fishing is on the inland streams and rivers here in Ohio as far as catching fish. Looks like the weather here is going to turn sour after today for the next week, good luck on your return trip. I will be about 125miles west of you that weekend on the big pond.  Whopper"
