I was just wondering if the shoreline of GBay around collingwood is fishable yet or is it still iced up? Also, i see everyone talking about fishing the tribs for steelhead and having great success but i know that the season isn't open for steel in the collingwood area so i was wonding if anyone is fishing the tribs around there ( and practicing C+R obviously) or do you have to hold off until the end of April?  Thanks a lot for your help and great job on the new board!"
