54405,Headhunter,2007-04-02 14:11:00,5703,"I live 5 minutes from there! Not surprised by the garbage at all! No excuses, but if you consider the number of people who use that area, travel past or through it, then add the winter months and the city's in-ability to clean during the snowy months, I'm not at all surpirsed by that! As I said, no excuses. HH"
