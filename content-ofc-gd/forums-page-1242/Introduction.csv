54501,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-02 20:42:00,181,"I would like to introduce my self, my name is Bryce and I live in the city of Kitchener. I am currently fourteen and have three things on my mind. First off Hockey, Second off Baseball, and third of Fishing. Hockey is my favourite sport! I play goalie and play it year round and hope to go far in my hockey career  I pretty much love to catch any kind of fish, but Muskie, Pike, and Salmon are my all time favourites. I'm not the greatest fishermen but I know how to fish. This summer I'm going up to Sauble beach to go fish the Sauble River. Do any of you know any facts on the Sauble River? Much appreciated.  Bryce"

54558,Dutch,2007-04-02 22:55:00,831,Welcome.  Enjoy the forums!
54562,GbayGiant,2007-04-02 23:05:00,1780,"Welcome Bryce. I've been to Sauble beach many times, but unfortunately I was the fish those days.  Never tried the river but if it's anything like Wasaga beach it will be good, I've never herd anyone talk about fishing it."
54564,Jen,2007-04-02 23:06:00,833,"Hello Bryce,  Welcome to OFC, you will find the people and posts to be very informative.  I have property up near Sauble Beach and have often fished the Sauble River at Sauble Falls, right next to the provincial park.  It is about 5 min north of town. If you go into the variety store on the North East corner just North of the parking lot the gentleman there will tell you everything you need to know about the area and also sells bait including roe sacks...  We have caught mostly trout, but during hot summer days the fishing is difficult unless you are willing to walk a long way from the bridge.  It is a great swimming place for all those teens camping at the parks close by.  Good Luck and if you get a chance while up there try fishing on Boat lake or at the boat launch directly adjecent to it.  Just ask directions while up there, it is on the road that goes east west from Oliphant to Wiarton... Amazing bass, channel cats, ling, and pike, just watch out for the water snakes .  I look forward to reading your posts.  Cheers,  Jen"
