Not to mention the odd occasion when the lift-drop of a Glo-Buzz Bomb will get strikes from rivermouth salmon when all else fails (you taught me that one........<cough>ACE<cough>)   Still looking for the ultimate pier salmon rod; beefy butt, fast action sensitive tip.  Loomis make a blank that fits, I've only been bugging them since L.G. was still in business"
53912,pameladallaire,2007-04-01 11:54:00,470,I agree with Whopper.  They are true works of art and craftsmanship!!  Beautiful.  Pam

54714,Spiel,2007-04-03 11:25:00,9065,"....Okay then....  Nipissing if you need any help along the way just send me a PM.  Daplumma, yes two of them will be heading your way.  GB, no I don't turn wood handles but I would like to set up for making my own wood reel seats some day. I can and do custom turn cork handles but most guys balk at having it done when they hear the price....lol  Skiel, this rod will be on its way to you, today.....!  "
54718,OhioFisherman,2007-04-03 11:34:00,6623,Very nice work!
53434,Spiel,2007-03-30 16:17:00,9065,....Well I have not been around much but what has been keeping me busy is fishing related....         I'm in various stages of work on a dozen rods with another six more to pick up! Got to get my butt in gear and finish these so I can find time to get out fishing.

53465,Spiel,2007-03-30 17:21:00,9065,"....Thanks everyone.  Joey, I have to make time for work as it pays the bills it's sleep that I'm generally unable to find time for.  Trapshooter those are a mix of Frontier and Loomis blanks.  TJ, you wanted a rod?  Thanks Brian, not sure I'll find the time though?"
53470,fishdawg,2007-03-30 17:47:00,912,looks good Chris have the riggers been installed yet??
53473,Spiel,2007-03-30 17:55:00,9065,"....Ah no, not yet Mark. Won't take me long though once I get a day off with decent weather."
53475,lew,2007-03-30 17:58:00,12767,"Awesome job as usual Chris, I'm always very impressed with the work you do !!"
53479,GbayGiant,2007-03-30 18:07:00,1780,"They look awesome spiel. Do you make rods for any species ? musky, walleye rods ? and do you turn any wood handles or all cork ?  Just for future reference. lol. I had a guy in MN make me a couple Loomis walleye rods with red cedar handles the wood really adds to the sensitivity and looks amazing too and it ended up weighing about 1 ounce more than the cork would have so the weight is no big deal. And he built them for cheaper than the retail versions ? don't know how he did that, but they are my favorite rods by far.  Just wondering encase I need some more rods one day, I'd rather stay in Canada."
53481,Kirk,2007-03-30 18:12:00,347,"Hi Spiel, is mine one of those in the pic?"
53497,Spiel,2007-03-30 20:03:00,9065,"....Thanks again everyone.  GB I'll get back to you on your questions, busy, busy, busy!  Oh and YES Kirk one of those is yours."

53559,Bernie,2007-03-30 22:57:00,3190,"Spiel, those are magnificent!!   Would really love to be able to do that. Dug an old lightning rod up to practice on. Too close to summer to get into it now but will be next winters project."
