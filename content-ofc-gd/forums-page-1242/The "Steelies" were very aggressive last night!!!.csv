53982,ccmtcanada,2007-04-01 15:44:00,7971,"Ok...Bly and I went out last night to try out luck at some night fishing for steelies on a local trib.  We got there around 10pm and put our lines in the water.  The conditions seemed prime for some action.  About 20 minutes into our drifting, we saw something break the surface!!!  Quick!! We adjusted our casting to that area...nothing...no hits.  We thought the fish had moved on....then suddenly and BIG splash!!!  We aimed our drifts that way!!  about 15 minutes later...another HUGE splash...it startled us, but we were pumped...the fish were here and aggressive!!  Bly could actually SEE the fish moving through the water.  The fish were held in a few deeper pools that we knew were in the area.  After a few hours of nothing, we began to question our ability. How is it that all these fish can be in the area and we didn't even get a hit??  Did we suck that badly at this? LOL.  Was our roe bad?  Were the depths wrong?  Our drifts seemed nice and natural, but nothing!!  Finally, after 2 hours of this going on, we saw this huge fish heading for the opposite bank....with the little light that was there, we saw it get REAL close to the bank.  It then WALKED up on the bank and winked at us  ....chattering...actually I belive it was laughing and taunting!!!    This beaver was there all night...travelling from deep pool to deep pool.  It all made sense after we saw it.  To think we wasted hours fishing a section of river that was being patrolled by a beaver.  It was after our fish...and the worst thing about it...there was no CO in sight...I bet it didn't have a valid fishing license... .  We were duped by a beaver...I can admit it...next time we'll know....."

53993,huntervasili,2007-04-01 16:17:00,1604,That really blows... betcha he scared all the fishes away... when they smack their tail on the water if you are oblivious to his being it will scare the $hi++ out of you... almost gave me a heart attack last time it happened cause he was all of 10 yards from the boat
54056,Joey,2007-04-01 19:24:00,9122,"Ahahahahahahaha, that's hilarious Cliff.  You're lucky you didn't catch it.  Trust me, you don't want to catch a beaver.  Joey"
54165,ccmtcanada,2007-04-01 23:18:00,7971," I know!!!  The funny thing is that Carole kept casting right in front of it, and pretty much plunked the thing off the head a few times....LOL.  We really thought we just sucked at trib fishing...haha."
54172,fishindevil,2007-04-01 23:31:00,6254,"Thats a funny one cliff.....lol..lol   i have had a muskrat do the same at the wilmot creek down near the mouth, he was moving around just before daybreak,and i could just barely make him out with my coleman lantern,so dont feel to bad ive been there done that....   better luck next time"

54298,GbayGiant,2007-04-02 03:17:00,1780,"I've seen a few beavers wink at me, pretty interesting stuff.    Ya, I remember the first time they did that to me, those beavers need anger management they can get ticked off in a hurry."
54327,Shelley Cooper,2007-04-02 09:18:00,394,Good chuckle to start my day Cliff...  Better luck next time...  Thanks for sharing...
