53989,4x4bassin,2007-04-01 16:00:00,1025,I heard this last night but I don't now if it is true or not.The MNR are going to make an anouncement in the next couple of days regarding the lifting of the ban on motors in the park(6HP and under are going to be allowed) I hope this isn't true because that is what makes Algonquin a one of a kind and a special place for all of us. I'm going to make some calls on Monday regarding this and try to get some more info. Has anyone else heard this ??
54019,luv2drift,2007-04-01 17:04:00,147,That would be a huge mistake if they allow motors.  Ican see on the bigger lakes small motors being allowed but 6hsp everywhere will ruin the expierence.
54021,luv2drift,2007-04-01 17:06:00,147,How would the MNR be involved?  Isn't it the Parks call?
54061,Smokey,2007-04-01 19:31:00,1278,I heard the same thing but wasn't sure if someone was trying and early april fools joke so I'm waiting to see it on paper before I believe it.  luv2drift doesn't MNR manage the parks and waters?
54064,bbog,2007-04-01 19:38:00,665,hope this isn't true - would be nice to keep a couple spots motor free.
54070,Smokey,2007-04-01 19:48:00,1278,I think most spots will still be quiet as guys will not want to haul motors across the portages.
54296,luv2drift,2007-04-02 03:12:00,147,Absolutely a good april fool's!  I am no expert and it is only a guess but I do doubt that the mnr has control over motors in the park.  It is the parks workers that enforce the rules I think?
54633,boatman,2007-04-03 01:32:00,350,"Algonquin is a Provincial Park so the MNR has jurisdiction. If it was a National Park like Point Pelee (National Park) then Parks Canada would have jurisdiction.  The MNR has the choice to allow motors or not at Algonquin, but I doubt they would."
54635,setomonkey,2007-04-03 01:34:00,872,"I hope they don't, they do allow motors on Opeongo, maybe a few other entry-point lakes, but not in the backcountry lakes.  Mike"
54692,Cookslav,2007-04-03 06:02:00,1457,"Absolutely an April fools joke... Heard this one on another board already.  No worries guys, Algonquin is safe for another year LOL..."
