54686,taper,2007-04-03 04:52:00,611,"I had one dive at my spoon running just below the surface 2 years ago, I seen him coming and tried to get it by him but caught his leg. As has been said one hell of a fight. Brought the bird to boat side and luckily removed the hook very easily. My wife was screaming and me and my son were laughing."
54689,ch312,2007-04-03 05:30:00,1590,"when i was younger i use to catch them on purpose   not really a very good fight and its quite easy to get them to you. just watch it because they can peck hard enough to cause near instant bruises.  5-6 years ago when we went to newfoundland i caught a herring gull ( i think?) and their wingspan is at least twice that of a normal seagull around here but they just look like giant seagulls. now THAT was a fight and a half....  just reel them in and fold their wings to their natural ""closed"" position against their body. hold their body under an arm and use the hand on the same arm to hold its head. gotta hold them pretty firmly or they will wiggle loose. then just remove the hooks and toss it in the air and watch it fly away."

It was in a small town canal area, the first person to come up to me was some old lady squaking about how I was a mean dude for messing with the sea gull, the second was a CO who says to me, while I'm still reeling in the bird, 'you'd better not hurt that bird ...I better see it fly off healthy...bla bla bla and stands by to watch (no help offered while I bring the bird to hand), wrestle with it CAREFULLY, get my hands covered in bird doo and untangle and unhook and release the bird to fly off and join the million others circling around.  I gave the old hag and the co a glare cleaned up and continued fishing...both walked away without thanking me for taking good care of the rat with feathers LOL"
