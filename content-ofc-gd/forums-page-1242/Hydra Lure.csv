54637,Heybud_e,2007-04-03 01:38:00,208,oh i have been here before... just been awhile  but thanks for the welcome
54641,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-03 01:50:00,4399,"Looks to me like it`s just another cheap import from China that some enterprising businessman buys for 2 bucks and dumps it on the North American market for 20 bucks.  It may work but i will doubt that it will work as good as the quality minnow type baits, don`t forget the lake where they shot the infomercial that hooked you is probably a lake where anyone could catch 300 fish a day."
54647,Heybud_e,2007-04-03 01:54:00,208,"yea, your probably right there lol, but i guess all i can do is try it out n see and post results some day down the road, but until then, im stuck travelling with North American Van Lines delivering stuff...."

I believe they are made somewhere in Quebec?  They have an awesome action to them though.  Not sure how much they changed, but I added a stinger hook to them."
54805,Zib,2007-04-03 14:30:00,369,"I've never used those lures let alone seen them. I make it a rule of mine to never buy any fishing gear that has the words ""As Seen On TV"" printed on the package."
54806,Heybud_e,2007-04-03 14:31:00,208,"Yo Joe! yea it has been awhile hasnt it  i have been realllllly busy, had some health issues a few months ago but am well and doing good now, also work got in the way of having fun heh but that's the way it goes...  and we could meet up for sure for some fishin!"
