I was at my mom's place last night and came across a bunch of pics from when I was a kid.  If you have some lying around...scan them and then post some pics...as well as a recent one...  Here's my pics...  First pic is of my brothers and dad...I'm the funny lookin one with the striped pants on...LOL.  This was probably around 1976.  My younger brother was afraid of the pike...hehe.   My younger brother and I....notice our poles made of small tree branches....used a little fishing line and a bobber.  Worms as bait....we'd sit on the dock all day and pull up small fish.  I'm the one on the right.   Here's me at Bonnie Lake in 1980   Another one of my dad and brothers...getting ready for a day out on the lake...I'm the one in the white shirt.   Here's my recent one....at least my fish got bigger as I did...LOL. "

54266,PatrickGG,2007-04-02 02:19:00,562,"Thats some cool pics i myself fished on my own as a child i used to stray away from the family on our outings and used my dads old rod and reel and flip stones looking for worms to fish with, my dad was into fishing in his younger years but i don't know what happened he just gave up on the sport its kinda sad i pressure him to go sometimes but he don't bother its all good i think i will go all the way even with my kids nothing makes me more happy to watch the excitement on my kids face when they pull in a fish."
