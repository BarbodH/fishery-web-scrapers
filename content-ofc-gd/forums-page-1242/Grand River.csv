54382,jediangler,2007-04-02 12:41:00,1923,Nothing but carp to fish for in the Kitchener area of the Grand until mid-May. You could try behind the Grand Hotel. There is some good carp fishing there.
54394,PatrickGG,2007-04-02 13:30:00,562,Yea theres plentiful carp in the grand and there is some really good hot spots But thats just something you need to explore just like lots of others do so. P.S Don't forget your bug spray in the summertime the bugs can get nasty.
54402,PERCHER,2007-04-02 14:04:00,787,This time of the year I prefer the lower Grand.Lots of big cats.we also have done well in the summer months for walleye.
