880040,manitoubass2,2014-11-09 17:38:00,11391,any help is appreciated...    you cant see in the pic too well but the fins are very sharp and also running a good distance down the back
880042,dave524,2014-11-09 17:43:00,4508,"Probably some kind of Stickleback, would help to see the dorsal fin erect."
880043,grt1,2014-11-09 17:49:00,638,looks like a minnow in someones hand
880044,manitoubass2,2014-11-09 17:50:00,11391,my thoughts as well. i could get a better pic as i was alone. dorsal fin was sharp and boney and ran maybe 3/5ths the length. if you look closely you can see minute humps on the back.  i tried to adjust the exposure for a better view but for some reason it wont save. ill keep trying. never seen these in the RR before
880046,Beavertail,2014-11-09 18:01:00,331,"Yup, I'd say stickle-back as well. Neat little buggers."
880047,dave524,2014-11-09 18:02:00,4508,http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/349568.pdf  This is a pretty good reference to Ontario Baitfish.
880049,manitoubass2,2014-11-09 18:24:00,11391,thanks dave that was the link i was looking for before i posted. still cant find it on there though? it had one long boney/sharp dorsal fin run its back. no individual spike.
880050,Musky or Specks,2014-11-09 18:33:00,2710,looks like a brook stickleback to me but no way to identify for sure without counting the spines
880053,BillM,2014-11-09 20:13:00,17367,Atlantic.
880055,Garfisher,2014-11-09 20:20:00,229,"Most definitely a Brook Stickleback, if you look close you can see the spines"
880057,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-09 21:00:00,8243,Live Target Stickleback?

880060,BillM,2014-11-09 21:21:00,17367,never gets old eh bill? hahahahaha.  LOL!!!  I can't help it
880062,manitoubass2,2014-11-09 21:23:00,11391," never seen one before, now walleye are full of em. might have migrated down from LOTW during the flood waters?"
880081,chris.brock,2014-11-10 00:32:00,4053,"stickle back, not the common 3 spine though  I have a book, Freshwater Fishes of Canada, Scott and Crossman, as a fisherperson or outdoors person, it's a great reference  if a used copy is online and cheap, it's facinating and great to have"
880102,Gerritt,2014-11-10 01:26:00,6129,Agreed I have the same book... Got it as a Christmas gift. Awesome resource

880142,limeyangler,2014-11-10 12:57:00,5204,Stickle back
880150,manitoubass2,2014-11-10 13:59:00,11391,Saweeeeet! What kind of braid shall i use to catch these beauties? Hahaha
880151,limeyangler,2014-11-10 14:22:00,5204,"Saweeeeet! What kind of braid shall i use to catch these beauties? Hahaha   All braid is the same, make sure you use wire though."

880168,limeyangler,2014-11-10 15:35:00,5204,Apparently you need marshmallows???
880188,Jon,2014-11-10 17:35:00,209,I'm going to guess Nine-spine Stickleback. Would be best to see a photo with the spines showing but the caudal peduncle looks to be too long to be a Brook Stickleback.  Jon
