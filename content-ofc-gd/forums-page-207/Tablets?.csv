879383,BillM,2014-11-04 05:12:00,17367,Get the latest Samsung Galaxy tab.
879384,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-04 05:28:00,8243,"I am in the same boat as you. We were able to go PC free here since about 2004 until 2012 and actually made it all the way through without a serious injury up to and including death. Imagine no computer in the house for 8 years and not one 9-1-1 call for lack of information, not one. So now it's November 1st 2012 and because of something I'm doing to generate some income to cover fuel costs for the boat the past season I didn't have, I need to put some green in my Blue Jeans.  I went to Future Shop and immediately nearly had a nervous breakdown right on the spot. The last PC I bought had a 56K dial up modem, the big decision was a built in or external modem. XL was the new operating system and I was told to stay away from it, a fad that wouldn't last. Huge 12"" screen. 4Gs, just massive and fast. Don't forget XL will never last, and those big easy to read graphic icons are so childish they are a flash in the pan fad too. that was 10 years ago  Now here I stand shaking as I stare across the store and see my wife watching a TV with 3D glasses on. Does anyone other than another 58 year old man squeezed into his leather High School football jacket have any idea what it means to be scared sh^t less?  My wife seemed to be enamoured with both the touch screen and the 20 year old sales clerk. So I said they don't have what your looking for here lets go and off we went to Fast Computers in Hagersville, a nice small little Mom and Pop jammed between a slice at a serving Pizzeria and the local Insurance broker. They had a touch screen on display and I told the young clerk this PC will be used to 1) peruse the internet, 2) download music, 3) download photos and manage both 2 and 3.  It is all in what the tablets operating system has the tablet is just the book, front cover back cover, binder and blank pages within. That's the tablet, what is written on the page is what you need to know, make sure it's in English. I was told by the salesman and owner that the Asus tablet I was about to purchase for $600.00 was exactly what I needed. The operating system was something called Windows8 RT, one problem with 8RT, can't download music of any format with it, can not be used with any Apple product, I Pad, I Pod, IPee, IPoo. No music therefor. The reason for this was exactly what I told the owner it was for, download music, 100% guarantee I was told..........Get it in writing is the smart thing to do I guess, he said I didn't specify it was for an Ipod. I guess that's the world we are in today, even in the Mom and Pop electronics shop in little old Hagersville whos 15 minutes of fame when they nearly burnt the place to the ground when a few million stored tires caught fire one cold miserable winters night. Heck that fire is still the talk of the town 20 some years latter, not everyday CNN is in town.  I do use the Asus touch screen often, battery lasts 10 times longer, more perhaps than my big heavy laptop. The laptop came with zero, nada nothing programs, each separate program costs $$, I have never had to buy a program, MS doesn't sell them they rent them by the month, smart move Bill.  Its portability is the best, no turning and sliding the laptop across the dinning room table to look at this or that, one arthritic hand and pick it up and hand it over. Everywhere you go you bring a good digital camera and movie camera, the family movies and wedding pictures. I think all about 12 oz.  The next PC I buy will be an Asus tablet, what will operate it, maybe Mac. But a tablet for sure and use the laptop as a back up,,,,,, with Word."
879385,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-04 05:33:00,8243,"2 year old thread, ah man really, I hope the above helps. I better pay a little more attention to detail.  However I see the great one is thinking about a Christmas present for his wife. My wife won't touch the laptop and won't let go of her Asus tablet. If you take away anything from what I wrote remember the tablet is the book, the operating system is the content."
879397,fisherman7,2014-11-04 12:43:00,325,"I have 2 Samsung tablets. The 7"" is great for portability and the 10"" is great for everything."
879398,Fisherman,2014-11-04 12:49:00,7201,"And I'll stick by my guns and say that there is still strife in my life over that POS Galaxy.  4 days ago it decided it wouldn't hook up to wifi..again.  Doesn't matter what, reboot, hot, cold, it's junk."
879402,hutch4113,2014-11-04 13:19:00,374,"It will all depend on what you want, and how savy you are RE: technology.  The Ipad - just works.  Very intuitive, and easy to pick up.  Having said that I am not an Apple guy - reason for that is the way they lock down adapters, etc. - have to purchase Apple if you want it to work right.  I have two tablets -> last year bought a Nexus 7.  This year bought a Galaxy Tab S.  Right now the Tab S is the best screen - hands down.  It also works great with any other Samsung product you may have - phone, TV (if it is a Smart TV), etc.  Another brand to consider is ASUS - they have a very good reputation for all of their products.  They are built nice, last a long time, and good value for money.  I would recommend set a budget - and then look at the Tablets available in that range."
879405,NewHips,2014-11-04 13:47:00,111,"I take my Nexus 7 with us on all our trips, 3 years now and still as good as new. Plenty of free Apps on  Google Play. Great battery life,with a $3 adapter and a $3 App you can plug a external flash memory into it and transfer files.....I bought the 32Gig, but really not necessary since you can buy additional storage pretty cheap. One thing to consider is the tablet compatible to connect or add additional storage."
879414,John,2014-11-04 14:34:00,2956,"I have a BB Playbook that I use for certain things, have used the Samsung but the iPad is the only one to get, hands down!"
879422,adempsey,2014-11-04 16:31:00,1498,"It's been two years, so what did you end up buying??? Lol."
879425,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-04 17:04:00,8243,I misspoke you can't run Apple on anything but a Mac. Right?
879433,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-04 17:53:00,10439,  
879435,Terry,2014-11-04 17:54:00,14456,now thats a tablet
879468,Pigeontroller,2014-11-04 22:00:00,2793,A Samsung Smartphone! LOL
879669,GBW,2014-11-06 02:36:00,8460,"Correct Old Ironmaker, Apple iOS (the operating system) is only for the products they have.  Android is OPEN via Google and others.  Samsung still makes ALL the Apple products to this day hence the legal battles the 2 have going on over who made what 1st.  Samsung is the #1 producer of high end LCD/LED/Plasma glass and sell the products that don't turn out perfect to all the others like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus, Acer and more...  They are also the biggest producer of the semiconductors (RAM/Memory) and housings (case of said tablet and or phone) in the world.  I NO LONGER WORK for them but when it comes to a TV, a smartphone or tablet I will gladly pay and extra few bucks to get a Samsung (for my own reasons like I just said).  Like the best glass aka screen, solid case and more. Notice the new iPhone 6 has problems bending yet the new Samsung Note 4 doesn't?  Someone cheaped out...  All the tier 2 brands are what they are, live long enough to cover the warranty and then who cares...  Me I would rather spend $300 for a tablet to last 3 or more years than $99 a year, year after year after year and worry about the true quality and support.  Just my peso since cents are long gone..."
879670,GBW,2014-11-06 03:04:00,8460,"I did have a review of 6 different tablet devices for you based on the products I reviewed via The Source web site with how I would spend the money but alas the bugs her from an F12 perspective just deleted my last 30 min of review info...  So, go get what you pay for is how I will end this.  No wonder why I don't post here anymore it's just a waste to try..."
879728,craigdritchie,2014-11-06 20:03:00,1586,"I would be lost without my iPad mini. Fits in a coat pocket, and does everything really, really well. Amazing device."
879730,dave524,2014-11-06 20:08:00,4508,"My wife and I have Kobo Arc's with 32 gb. memory, e-readers with tablet capability. They have been great the year or so we've had them and were on for 99 bucks off the Kobo site."
879769,scuro2,2014-11-07 04:21:00,904,"Samsung makes some great tablets.  As well as the IPad but I can't stand apple products. Samsung tablets are usable, but as with all Samsung products you are buying a pale imitation of someone's original good idea. They have gotten better at imitating over the years. Cheaper for a reason."
879770,GBW,2014-11-07 04:23:00,8460,re-read the whole thread scurco2.
879781,Canuck2fan,2014-11-07 07:37:00,1444,"My wife and I have Kobo Arc's with 32 gb. memory, e-readers with tablet capability. They have been great the year or so we've had them and were on for 99 bucks off the Kobo site.  + 1 for me they are a perfect choice.  Lots of others though claim the arc is no good because they HAVE to have GPS, bluetooth, the ability to play movies from a harddrive, be able to be tethered to their data plan on their phone and mini HDMI out on any device.... While having all that probably would be helpful at times if you are going to be using a tablet on the road, but a tablet with all that costs so much more that I would be afraid to take it outside anyway. LOL"
734751,Pigeontroller,2012-10-05 22:37:00,2793,Thinking of getting a Tablet. Main use would be web browsing and photo storage...I know nothing about them and am not the most computer savy person...Any recomendations?
734753,Live2fish85,2012-10-05 22:40:00,1633,Samsung makes some great tablets.  As well as the IPad but I can't stand apple products.
734754,davey buoy,2012-10-05 22:42:00,5505," I agree,Samsung makes a beauty machine."
734756,BillM,2012-10-05 23:07:00,17367,I dunno if a tablet would be my first choice for photo storage....
734759,danbouck,2012-10-05 23:11:00,4380,"I've used a samsung, acer and apple for work. The acer is better than the samsung and the ipad beats them all imo"
734760,Pigeontroller,2012-10-05 23:14:00,2793, Maybe I should have said photo viewing...
734764,ttahhan,2012-10-05 23:25:00,191," Personally i dislike the Apple i pad however, dollar for dollar and, quality for quality its the only one to really get, it will be useful for, Fish maps ,Gps, depth charts, and all kinds of other things Apple has a lot of useful apps and they are always updating newer material frequently...."
734765,GBW,2012-10-05 23:35:00,8460,"both are made the same way at the same factory; this is coming from an ex samsung person (me).  the samsung one is a real nice, light and easy to use unit too.  My 5 year old son knew how to use it with ease when he was 4 if that helps."
734768,ketchenany,2012-10-05 23:40:00,3229,"I've had and IPad for two two years now (original) This thing is great, I took it to Europe in the summer did the same things there maps, locating things .  App wise anything you can imagine. I would like to upgrade with the latest because of the camera . . .And other features, using it now  But then I only use Apple computers at home and work, have been since they came out."
734772,Fisherman,2012-10-05 23:47:00,7201,"I can only say from personal experience, my wife has the Samsung Galaxy 10 tablet and it near resulted in divorce.  I say unless you are computer savvy and don't need a lot of Advil you might get through the change from PC to Tablet.  In my view it is not user friendly and every now and then when updates happen,  see ya, I'm off to the farthest sport shop I can find.  Noooooo, I don't want to hear what your Tablet is doing now and what it has changed and what you can't do or find.  I think I would go with the iPad if I had to go with any of them."
734776,GBW,2012-10-05 23:55:00,8460,"That is an operating system problem when that happens.  Mine was OS 3.9.9 and now it's 4.04 and runs like a dream.  yes things look different and are in diff spots but that's why 'Windows' always has a new version os something too. It's the software, not the actual unit.  hell, if you want, test out the UNOBook by eduGear that I can get.  It's a tablet with a ruggedisied (sp? beers now...) case. FLASH is NOT supported on ANY android OS after 3.9.9 as an FYI."
734780,gordy28,2012-10-06 00:40:00,638,I'll be the first one I guess We have 2 Blackberry playbooks and love them. Small and lightweight-never had any issues.
734782,woodenboater,2012-10-06 00:45:00,2277,"ha ha, gordy beat me to it  very easy to pack or carry in a jacket pocket if one wanted to. fits in the back pocket of my jeans too.  and this from a lifelong Mac user."
734783,ketchenany,2012-10-06 01:10:00,3229," GBW I have a two year old  grand daughter who will be your neighbour Dec 14 and she scrolls through an iPod looking for movies that will make your head shake. All of them (2-4 year olds) have  eyed the iPad but it's off limits.  These kids make us look like we are still dialling an old rotary phone, hei I have one of those never mind . . .lol"
734784,Fang,2012-10-06 01:26:00,1330,I am typing this on a BB play book just bought a month ago at Staples for $115. Great product for web surfing. I still use my iPod for music though
734786,SlowPoke,2012-10-06 01:37:00,2984,"2 Playbooks for us as well. If you're looking for games, look elsewhere. If you're looking for browsing, graphics, MSOffice updating, e-reader, multi-tasking ability and convenient size; you won't find a better value. Another perk is OS updates, not new hardware. The Playbook is a stand alone unit now with OS 2. Initially it relied heavily upon your BB smartphone, now it just compliments it."
734788,Christopheraaron,2012-10-06 01:39:00,3525," x1,000,000,000,000,000"
734789,silveradosheriff,2012-10-06 01:46:00,1025,"We have all three platforms and IMHO the best value is definitely the Playbook (when on sale), while the easiest to use is the ipad."

734793,ketchenany,2012-10-06 02:01:00,3229,"  There you go, Apple plug and play.  These things are like buying boats and lures everyone has an opinion/favorite. I say what ever you can affod and what ever you are comfortable with. Myself I have occasionally used PC and I can get by if need be, but an Apple product it's my boat/lure favorite.  At 11, Roy will lock this for sure lol"
734796,FisherJuli,2012-10-06 02:27:00,125,"I won an IPad3, and have used my Playbook longer than that...  Pros of Playbook: smaller, more portable, waaay cheaper, crisp pics, my preference for reading since it's smaller, great battery life, awesome to make hd video and play on HDTV, some fun apps but I don't have a ton or use a ton on it. I like this because I can launch and keep my programs open. Nice cuz it easily opens my Microsoft programs. Good browsing. For the price, it can't be beat in my mind. Great sound. We hook up the hdmi cable and watch shows we missed on tv with ease. Great to sync my bb to.  The iPad pros: some really cool apps (most) you need to buy, good camera shots, crisp images, different app styles from the bb but equally functional, equally useful at browsing, great battery, but I don't like how you can only open one program at a time. It's heavier, but great display being slightly larger. Good video. Good browsing. Great sound.  I can use some work programs easier with one tablet, and others with the other but there is no favourite.  Good luck choosing!!"
734797,Pigeontroller,2012-10-06 02:56:00,2793,Thanks everyone. Sounds like the BB is a good choice for me considering the price...
734798,fishinguypat,2012-10-06 02:57:00,547,"If you don't want an ipad, best next thing for smaller form factor would be the Google Nexus 7."
734800,backbay,2012-10-06 03:13:00,773,"   lol, my oldest son is now 14, and therefore I now have an in-house tech department.  As far as the tablet is concerned, my gf has an ipad, and for sure, it's great, but frankly, I haven't tried any others. If Samsung's tablet is as good as their phones, it might be worth at least looking at, though."
879381,grt1,2014-11-04 04:34:00,638,"so this thread is 2 years old and many things have changed in the ipad and tablet formats, I;m looking for updated opinions on them,  I'm thinking of getting the wife one for Christmas and don't know which way to go. she basically plays games and does emailing on her stand alone computer but I was thinking one of these would be more convenient for her to use.  I would sure appreciate discussion on this topic."
