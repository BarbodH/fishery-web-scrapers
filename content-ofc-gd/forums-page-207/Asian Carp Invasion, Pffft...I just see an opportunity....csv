And it is better than 99% of all TV commercials out there, for 3 minutes at least. It is 3 minutes too long and all the bad acting, really bad acting has to go, all of it.  Are those Asian Carp? Sure looks real but with what CGI can do today one never knows what's filmed and what's CGI. If it's CGI it's some of the best I've ever seen, if real Asian Carp we have a problem Houston."

The loss of a fishery and an entire ecosystem takes a back seat to all that makes headlines every morning. I like the solution some have come forward with, eat them into extinction."
879905,OhioFisherman,2014-11-08 09:17:00,6623,"I was kind of shocked when I saw a video earlier in the year of them netting those on Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley, I had no idea they had made it into those waters. in two days they netted like 80,000 pounds of them. One of those rascals is cat food for a year?"
879909,Fisherman,2014-11-08 13:50:00,7201,"One of those rascals is cat food for a year? I don't know hat they are waiting for.  There was another program where they had harvested A/Carp for human consumption and unless you were told what it was, no one was the wiser or complained."
