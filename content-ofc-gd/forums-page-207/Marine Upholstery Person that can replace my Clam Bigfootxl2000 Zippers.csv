879852,quickme,2014-11-07 19:57:00,261,I'm looking for a recommendation for a place that can replace the CRAPPY zippers on my clam.  I don't know what type but anything would be better than the ones that are on there.  I live in stouffville and work in scarborough.

Last year, the tub cracked on my one man flip over.  Sent a few pics to them with an explanation as to what happened, within a week, I had a new tub delivered via UPS free of charge.  The clam was 4 years old, and they replaced it no questions asked..  It's worth a shot.."
