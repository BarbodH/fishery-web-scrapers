I dont get the good stuff that often,but when I can,Im there.  Toast/eggs,hash browns and pudd,n.   It was a crisp start to the drive up.    Before heading to their house,I decided to drive the hill and take a couple of scenery pictures of their area. Fresh snow fall over night.  What a view this time of year.    That,s  my pop,s and mudder,s place.    Pops been telling me about how the turkeys have really populated up there. He has had a lone Tom for about the last 3 years. Then a few more showed and now he says theres about 40 or so. Two different year classes. And to think,there were none 5-6 years ago. Introduction does work.  He says this is half of the bunch that he feeds. The deer will be joining them soon.    I averaged 9.6 lt per 100.  That,s no different then if I drove the old Avenger up there.     It was darn cold up there this morning.      "

879834,misfish,2014-11-07 17:29:00,29133,Cool. Great mileage. Now with the price lower too eh.  Fuel was anywhere from $1.10 to $1.13 on the way up there.
879835,Terry,2014-11-07 17:42:00,14456,cool  now you need to  find an atv and boat that are good on gas too....lol

879838,fishnsled,2014-11-07 18:04:00,3520,"That's is great mileage, the jury is out on the blood pudding though."
879840,4x4bassin,2014-11-07 18:19:00,1025,Not to sure about the blood pudding but nothing like a good breakfast feed from Mom !
879846,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-07 19:25:00,8243,"Yea the mileage, that's what I noticed, 9 point anything is good on any 1/2 ton. I'm both impressed and depressed at the same time. As for the blud puddin' you can have all of my share, 100% of it. Mom an Dad are still with us but Mom can't cook anymore at the retirement residence or won't should I say, enjoy them now as much as possible. I sure miss those Italian Sunday feasts, we all do. I guess it's my turn now, I don't mind. I'm teaching any of the kids Mom and Noni's recipes now if they are interested.  Brian if you don't make the sausages, learn now and pass it on some day."
879847,manjo39,2014-11-07 19:34:00,354,Worth every km. You're feeding your soul.
879850,misfish,2014-11-07 19:50:00,29133,"cool  now you need to  find an atv and boat that are good on gas too....lol  Im still dreaming.LOL    newfies have a sick sense of humor when it comes to guard rails  The rail was to make sure you didnt go off the end of the road. Ya 3ft ditch. The other well,hang on.   That's is great mileage, the jury is out on the blood pudding though.  If pop had not eaten all the smelts I dropped off in March  ,it would of been even better.    Not to sure about the blood pudding but nothing like a good breakfast feed from Mom !  Mudders rule. I even got a peck on the forehead when I left. That,s like the best.    If I could, I would,but it,s an art. There are somethings that are meant to be left to the ones that know.  I,ll just enjoy it while I can.    Worth every km. You're feeding your soul.  AMEN to that."
879851,Headhunter,2014-11-07 19:56:00,5703,"Man, if you only had some smelt to go with that sausage, I'd be there! LOL HH "

879915,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-08 17:16:00,8243,"I'm a bit disappointed you are willing to let the tradition die. I hate blood sausage but was forced into child slavery a long time ago and forced to make them. I can't stand the smell, texture, anything and will still make a few pounds for my Dad and others."
879917,misfish,2014-11-08 17:28:00,29133,"If I knew,I would try to make it. it,s made more like a loaf now. Just slice off some pieces and fry it up. Almost like a hash."
879920,irishfield,2014-11-08 18:34:00,26272,When's the last time you sliced some pieces off some hash?
879921,misfish,2014-11-08 18:51:00,29133,When's the last time you sliced some pieces off some hash?  Ask Terry
879986,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-09 02:45:00,8243,"PM returned Brian, good luck, the more you practice the luckier you get. I went on You Tube there is a video, in French though,"
880013,gordy28,2014-11-09 13:03:00,638,"Gets me anxious for Christmas morning, the one day of the year my family does a traditional Scottish fry up Blood pudding, Lorne's sausage, potato scones, Ayrshire bacon, a fried egg all wiped up with some fried bread... Only do it once a year now as its all my arteries can take But when I was a kid my pop (grandfather) used to do this every sunday at 11.  After fly fishing practice at the rose dale bridge and before we hit the big lake for bass and walleye on Balsam Thanks for the post. Good memories stirred up Cheers Gordy"
