879842,lew,2014-11-07 19:07:00,12766,"Thanks once again everyone and this will be my final update but I just wanted to let everyone know that Diane is now home from the hospital and feeling pretty darned good.  I find it absolutely amazing that a person can have a major surgery on Tuesday and be home on Friday afternoon and it says a whole bunch about the wonderful health care system we have in the country.  Lakeridge Health in Oshawa is a fantastic hospital and everyone from the surgeon to the cleaning staff and everyone in between was great and they all treated Diane like she was the most important person in the building.  She was in Critical Care the whole time and the nursing staff that work there are absolutely top notch and I can't praise them enough.  And finally, thanks to all on this board that  have supported us thru this lousy time."

Just last week I got a bad call from a very old friend, found a tumor on both lungs. So even though I really don't know you both I'm cheering for a fast uneventful recovery up that way.  Now it's time to plan that Xmas party, what time should we all be there!!!?"

879553,lew,2014-11-05 11:00:00,12766,Morning everyone and thanks for all the good wishes for my wife.  It sure was nice waking up this morning knowing this lousy stuff is behind us now and hopefully forever. One of the 1st things Diane said in the recovery room yesterday was how happy she was to be rid of the cancer and I could really see it in her smile.  It's a horrible disease that has taken too many of mine and your friends and family over the years and hopefully they'll come up with a full cure someday.
879573,fishindevil,2014-11-05 13:41:00,6254,"wow !!! thats  awesome news lew,and im glad things went ok and diane is going to have a full recovery and be back home and things will return to normal in no time !!!!!  its great news for sure......"

874157,lew,2014-09-26 15:33:00,12766,Thanks for the offer Gerritt but I've pretty well got it all covered.  I'm only 30 minutes north east  of Havelock though if you ever want to stop buy for a java.

You and your loved ones are not alone and there is strength in numbers. Prayers from here via G mail, God mail. Hang tough buddy she needs you now more then anytime in your marriage.  Just an opinion, do not cancel the Xmas do, get everyone together and help her put it on. Getting ones mind off this during recovery is the best medicine. We are going on 3 years Cancer free here."
874264,motv8tr,2014-09-27 14:52:00,2587,Glad to know it was found early and will be taken care of quickly!  Here's hoping it will all go smoothly and you'll never have to go through this again.  Maureen

Not the stuff I wanna read when I'm on here catching up   It however sounds like things where caught at the best possible time so I'm sure the road might be a little bumpy but Diane will sail through with flying colors Debbe had her cancer 18 years ago and is still here, healthy as a horse and still putting up with me. Our prayers are for the same results for you folks."

I have a flying buddy that keeps telling me these things are all a test.... it would just be nice if someone would supply the study material.  All the best to Diane and her loving husband of 48 years! Wayne"
879479,lew,2014-11-04 23:59:00,12766,"Hi guys  I hadn't planned on bumping this post to the top again but we've received so many emails, phone calls and PM's since I told about my wife's cancer that I just can't reply to everyone individually.  The surgery was performed at Lakeridge Hospital in Oshawa this morning and the surgeon  says it was a complete and total success. Part of her left lung was removed in a 3 hour operation along with the cancerous tumor and she is now completely cancer free.  Diane is in the Critical Care Unit  for a couple days then will move to a regular room for a couple days more then she heads home.  The doctor says after a bit of recuperation she'll be nearly as good as ever and will lose a bit of lung function but not enough to even really notice. She walks 3 miles almost every day and the doc says that'll continue with no problems. He said she wouldn't be able to climb a mountain but Diane said that's not a big deal because she couldn't  climb a mountain before the surgery LOL  It's been a very tough  couple months  for my family and friends but as I type this I feel like a hundred pounds has been lifted from my shoulders.  I'm staying in an Oshawa hotel close to the hospital but it'll sure be nice to get home in a few days and Diane starting to enjoy life again.  Thank you  VERY much to all that have emailed, phoned, PMed and in general just really helped my wonderful wife get through a tough couple months.  Your really a great group."
879481,irishfield,2014-11-05 00:03:00,26272,Thanks for the update Lew.. sounds like things have gone well ! Get some sleep... you're gonna need it once she gets home!

873759,spincast,2014-09-23 23:14:00,3279,Pulling for ya down here Lew. Know just how you feel - That diagnosis is like hitting a brick wall at 60. I just had a few square inches of my face removed last month.   Just waiting confirmation that the whole C patch is now in the incinerator. May the surgery go well and you and Diane have the joy of many more anniversaries to come.
873765,moxie,2014-09-23 23:33:00,1566,WoW! This frigging crap is everywhere. Fingers and toes crossed. All the best.

873783,SirCranksalot,2014-09-24 00:54:00,3291,"Wow. That's scary stuff, Lew. I had an x-ray last jan that showed some sort of lump. A bunch of test later, incl CT scan, and a bronscoscopy indicated that it was most likely not cancer. I'm relieved now but the whole experience was quite unsettling. Here's wishing you and your wife all the best thru these tough times."

873814,lew,2014-09-24 09:56:00,12766,"Thanks for all the good wishes folks, it means a lot to both of us.  And Cliff, thanks for the offer of a place to stay during Diane's time in hospital, it's much appreciated, but it's already covered.  It's been a scary time around here for the last couple months but we're both feeling pretty confident now after talking with the doctor. This is evidently the most common type of lung cancer and this is the surgery that's normally used and with good success, specially when it's caught early like this.  We host a big Christmas party every year and Diane always goes overboard  making it nice for everyone, but now between myself and some friends we've convinced her to cancel it this year and I think that's got her more upset than the illness LOL"
873892,manjo39,2014-09-24 19:57:00,354,"Hey Lew, I feel like I know you even though we've never met.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  All the best.  My dad went through something similar but in his stomach.  They caught it early and he overcame it and still doing great years later."
873897,lew,2014-09-24 20:17:00,12766,"Thanks manjo, and funny how we feel like we know folks around here even though we've never met.  Good to hear of your dad's full recovery and we're hoping for likewise."
873902,fishnguy,2014-09-24 20:26:00,96,"Never good news, but as you said, could be worse.  Praying for a full, speedy recovery!"
874067,Spiel,2014-09-25 20:34:00,9065,I'm going to only focus on the good news Lew with the positive attitude that it'll only be good news going forward.
874078,aplumma,2014-09-25 21:17:00,6896,I am glad to hear the good news Lew. I am confident that Dianne will be just fine. I have sent prayers since I found out just after our trip up north and it hopefully will continue to help.   All our wishes and prayer Dianne.  Art and Joe

874131,Fish Farmer,2014-09-26 11:54:00,2234,"Sorry to hear the bad news Lew, but I'm sure the good news will be the last of that horrible ""C"" word. You have my thoughts Lew."
874133,lew,2014-09-26 12:03:00,12766,"Thanks very much Pete & Dave, the words of encouragment mean a lot to Diane"
873700,lew,2014-09-23 15:24:00,12766,"Bad news is my wife developed a cold awhile back that lingered so our doctor decided to take an X-ray and when they looked at it a spot appeared in the picture by her left lung. Another picture was taken and it was still there so they did a Cat-scan and the darned spot was still there.  Diane was sent to a cancer surgeon and he thought it looked like it could be cancer, infact he was kinda sure it was so he set up a whole bunch of tests for confirmation..  The last month or so we've been travelling between Peterboro, Oshawa & Toronto hospitals where my wife has undergone more tests then you would believe.  Now the good news.  We had another meeting with the surgeon yesterday and it turns out it's a small early stage cancer and hasn't spread anywhere else and is confined to the upper lobe of her left lung.  Diane's scheduled for surgery November 4th where a section of her upper lung will be removed along with all the cancer.  The surgeon will make 3 small (ish) incisions and will remove it through them.  There'll be a couple days in intensive care, then a few more days in a regular room and if all goes well, she'll be home in less than a week.  We'll be needing some crossed fingers when the time comes, but I've got a lot of faith in this doctor and everybody feels this will all have a happy ending.  Our 48th wedding anniversary is coming up in a couple weeks and I've already told her I'm counting on another 48.  I'm only posting this because we've made alot of friends on this board in the last 12 years and many know about this and I just wanted everyone to know things are now looking up.  All prayers will be gratefully received though.    "

873704,leaf4,2014-09-23 16:04:00,2466,That stinks that you and your wife have to go through this but at least the prognosis is good and there's reason to be optimistic about it!  Prayers for you both!
