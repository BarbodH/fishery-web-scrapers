879295,thatleetboy,2014-11-03 17:26:00,143,"I picked up a used motor off kijiji with the thought of building a mount, putting it on my canoe.  I'm having some trouble understanding what my options are for a battery.  Has someone here used one of these on a canoe or dinghy, can point me in the right direction?  Even a link that explains battery choice would be helpful.  Many Thanks"
879298,captpierre,2014-11-03 17:36:00,2521,"You want a deep cycle battery.  Is it a 12, 24 or 36 v motor?"
879301,thatleetboy,2014-11-03 17:58:00,143,OK Thanks captpierre. I was told that it is a 5 year old Minn Kota Endura 40. I assume it is 12v.
879303,BillM,2014-11-03 18:05:00,17367,"Yeah, it's a 12V...  You'll want to put the battery in the front of the canoe as a deep cycle isn't exactly light!"
879332,thatleetboy,2014-11-03 21:24:00,143,"Yeah, it's a 12V...  You'll want to put the battery in the front of the canoe as a deep cycle isn't exactly light!  BillM  Good advice, Thanks  I assume that means getting some extra long cables...."
879333,Joeytier,2014-11-03 21:25:00,3990,"I have a 55 lb minn kota for my sportspal.  I have an Interstate pro series 29....the largest interstate deep cycle.  If you go to a battery shop or do some research online there is a simple formula you can use to figure out how big of a reserve yoy need to match the draw of your motor.  For the 55, it was the largest haha  I run my battery just ahead of my feet, about 1/3 of the way up canoe but could also put it under my arse if I was strapped for space.  Either way, if you're by yourself you will need at least 70 pounds up in the bow to weigh the front end down.  If I had cable to spare I would just run the battery up at the bow.  Do such cable extensions exist?"
879337,misfish,2014-11-03 21:58:00,29133,"I would suggest you go with a sealed battery. I went with the Optiima AGM 12 volt. as per suggesting from Terry.  No leaking and you can lay it on it,s side. And it weighs 24 pounds.    It,s pricey at just close to 200 bux, but worth it IMO."
879341,thatleetboy,2014-11-03 22:27:00,143,"Joeytier > Yes, I believe that rewiring with longer cables is not difficult... I will let you know!  Brian B > That looks amazing! This is exactly why I am finding this so difficult to decide... BTW where exactly did you get that battery?  Cheers"

879344,davey buoy,2014-11-03 22:42:00,5505,"I used to put mine under my seat in the canoe.Out of the way,but always had at least one person with me so the weight issue was none existent.By yourself add some extra wire,not a big deal. I had a 30 Endura on mine."
879345,John Bacon,2014-11-03 22:43:00,3277,"You run 6 or 8 gauge wire from the battery to the motor.  That is available in any length that you want.  Any deep cycle battery will work.  The bigger the battery, the longer the charge will last.  But you will not want to portage a large deep cycle battery."
879348,irishfield,2014-11-03 22:57:00,26272,Don't forget a fuseable link or resettable circuit breaker within a foot of the battery.... 800 CCA could make a lot of smoke mid way down that ganoe...
879375,thatleetboy,2014-11-04 01:41:00,143,"There's some really helpful insights here guys, thanks!  irishfield > it came with a Minn Kota Battery Box.... think that will work as a circuit breaker? Do you think this case would hold the kind of sealed AGM battery that Brian B is suggesting?   Cheers"
879376,irishfield,2014-11-04 02:08:00,26272,"Yep.. looks like it has a 60 amp for wire / motor protection and a 10 amp for the ""cigarette"" plug on the case.  Says it fits 24 and 27 series batteries... so you can stuff most anything in that box."
879408,AKRISONER,2014-11-04 13:57:00,5558,"Hey Guys,  I am currently undergoing a project of installing a Powerdrive on a tinner as well. Does anyone have any suggestions on a circuit breaker for the line?  I unfortunately only have the plug side of the motor so I am going to have to make my own power line.  I can personally vouch for Optima Batteries. The yellow or blue deep cycle marine batteries are bullet proof, and you can get them from walmart for a decent price!"
879445,misfish,2014-11-04 18:47:00,29133,Not sure I would want a lead acid wet battery in my canoe.
879459,Joeytier,2014-11-04 21:10:00,3990,I've been doing it for years.  Whats the problem?
879462,misfish,2014-11-04 21:36:00,29133,"I've been doing it for years. Whats the problem?  You tell me which battery. in a mishap, is safer?  Sealed is sealed. Capped wet lead  acid is prone for a problem."
879463,davey buoy,2014-11-04 21:42:00,5505,"Keep it upright,worked for me for a few years."
879466,misfish,2014-11-04 21:46:00,29133,Dont get me wrong here fellas.  Im just looking at the safer side of things here.
879636,Shloim,2014-11-05 22:33:00,515,"I had a 31 Deka in my canoe with a 30lb motor, it would last all weekend, so even smaller ones will do fine. One thing I had that was great was a minn kota battery box. It had great handles as the battery is heavy, built in circuit breakers and 2 cigarette lighter sockets, excellent for electronics and charging plus made for easy hook ups and tear downs. well worth the $60. Also Im a sworn Deka battery man, there may be others that are good but Ive always, always been happy with Deka"
