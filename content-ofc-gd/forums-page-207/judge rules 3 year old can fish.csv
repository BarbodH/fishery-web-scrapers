I can do this till my limmit is filled then I must stop fishing and can no longer drive the boat or assist in the act of fishing in any way.  Right .  If I throw the front of the fish back in the water while he holds on the tail does that mean I released mine while he kept his?  that would fall under the commercial fishery act cause he gets paid and has a license to do so       how the hell would I know, I just make it up as I go  lol"

879092,Woodsman,2014-11-02 00:43:00,1286,Simply if the child is actually fishing no problem with the extra lines. If the child has wondered off to play or asleep than pull the extra lines. I've seen a few claim their baby asleep in a car seat justifies an extra line.

That anyone has been to show when it has come up. All it says is you can not party fish... LOL  I have heard people say they have been told what Terry says is absolutely correct by a CO saying you best put that fish back or I am going to start writing....  Then I have seen shoving matches that almost became fist fights because other people have said it is the person's fish who sets the hook's fish, because it is their rod in the eyes of the law... They also have had to release a fish on their child's line or pay a fine for being over their limit.  The interesting thing is the people who agreed with Terry said it happened on Simcoe on the ice, and the people willing to punch it out said the opposite happened when they were ice fishing at Longpoint on Erie. Me I just kept quiet and wished I had some popcorn, and wondered to myself why don't CO's ever get together and decide how exactly they are going to do things?"

Yes I've seen it in heated huts & also during openwater fishing. And yes some have tried to justify extra rods due to the babies being there.

According to a recent Spiritwood court case, in March, the man had been fishing on Turtle Lake with his daughter and there were four lines in the water.  Under Fisheries Act rules, anglers who are ice fishing can only have two lines in the water at the same time.  A conservation officer ticketed him, saying the little girl didn't have the ability to set up the icefishing rig, maintain it, watch it and retrieve fish.  The father fought the ticket in provincial court and won.  Part of his evidence was the Saskatchewan Anglers Guide 2014, which on its cover shows what appears to be a father helping his young daughter bait a hook.  No minimum age  Judge Dan O'Hanlon said the only issue to be determined was whether or not the three-year-old was legally fishing.  Reviewing the rules, he decided there's no minimum age limit for what constitutes an angler.  ""Just because an individual is three years of age, and does not have the ability to do everything required when fishing, it does not mean that he or she cannot legally fish,"" O'Hanlon said in a written ruling.  He then found the father not guilty of the"

That being said, i set up lines for her last winter ice fishing, and she could not reel in a fish with gloves etc. So her fish were released and I decided the better method was to assist her landing fish on my rods and of course they went towards my limit if I chose to harvest.

There is a CO in Saskatchawan the seems to think that way.  In my opinion, any child who is engaged in the fishing should be able to have their own rod(s).  I think this should apply even if they need some assistance.  Some inexperienced adults still need assistance.  I do think that putting an extra rod in for a kid who is not even paying attention to what is going on should not be allowed.  The child should be involved in the fishing in order to count as an angler."
