880009,bigugli,2014-11-09 12:40:00,6138,"Don't have a right to complain if you don't participate in the process. Personally, all the regs, studies, red tape, and meetings, mean nothing as long as  enforcement is inadequate."
880035,Joeytier,2014-11-09 17:07:00,3990,Completed.
880038,Musky or Specks,2014-11-09 17:29:00,2710,FINISHED. ALTHOUGH I BELEIVE IT WILL JUST PUT MORE PRESSURE ON AN ALREADY OVER PRESSURED ENFORCEMENT BRANCH
