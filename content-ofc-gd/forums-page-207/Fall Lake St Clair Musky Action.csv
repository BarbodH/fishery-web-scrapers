Went out this morning and caster for 2 hours got nothing, then jigged for 20 minutes before I had to come in and lost a nice fish almost right away.  Hopefully the weather holds up and I can get more footage this weekend."

879906,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-08 09:28:00,8243,Now that's an introduction. Gotta a get me a Go Pro one of these days. Nice little toys. You are going to get wrists like Pop Eye using the reel without palming it.
879908,PBenson,2014-11-08 13:39:00,154, Lol everyone tells me that I just don't like how it feels palming it with my rod. I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually.
