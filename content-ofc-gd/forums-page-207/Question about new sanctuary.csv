878343,steelhunter,2014-10-26 19:09:00,81,Friend of mine was just up in coboconk and the dam has a new sign on it saying no fishing sanctuary but I can't find anything in the regs about it. Anyone have any information about this. My family used to have the cottage at the dam and I can remember people fishing there until mid November.. I guess this is a new thing.
878344,steelhunter,2014-10-26 19:11:00,81,Admin delete one post somehow got posted twice
878345,Musky or Specks,2014-10-26 19:35:00,2710,It is illegal to fish within 25 meters of any dam. It is possible that they have posted a sign to remind people of this.
878347,steelhunter,2014-10-26 19:43:00,81,People have always fished off the dam for 30 years since I have been going up there never a prob with the Mnr they have been there lots of times checking people for fish and lic.
878348,misfish,2014-10-26 19:48:00,29133,Maybe their just getting to this spot. I use to fish dams for many years. Many of them are now posted. NO FISHING.
878367,esoxansteel,2014-10-27 00:12:00,1307,"Could it be an old sign from the spring, theres still some signs in the lower otonabee that the MNR have put up,"
878386,Dutch01,2014-10-27 01:48:00,1431,"I was in Coby last night.  I was fishing from the bridge because there was no more room on the damn dam!  So whether it's illegal or not I don't know, but guys are still doing it."
878436,Sinker,2014-10-27 17:08:00,8692,Its pretty simple to look up the regs online and find this info out. Give it a read sometime!  S.
878438,Dutch01,2014-10-27 17:30:00,1431,"From what I have read in the Regs, the dam has to have a fish ladder to be a sanctuary.  I'll be fishing in Coby again this weekend, I'll walk up to the dam and see what the signs say."
878439,jimmer,2014-10-27 17:38:00,2730,It's probably a sign for the spring. Dams open after the initial opening of the second Saturday in May and are considered sanctuaries. Probably best to do as Sinker says.
878449,Dutch01,2014-10-27 18:38:00,1431,"I read the regs, and appears there has to be a fish ladder for it to be a sanctuary.  Like I said I'll be there this weekend and will check the signs.  I've never fished the dam, I have a few good shore spots on Balsam...."
878453,Sinker,2014-10-27 18:48:00,8692,"Your missing the exceptions in fmz 17.....give it a good read. I know what it says, but you guys should also be able to read and understand the regs.  S."
878457,Dutch01,2014-10-27 18:55:00,1431,"I've read the regs, including the exceptions for zone 17, many times and don't see what you're talkig about.  Maybe you could share what you know with people asking for clarification?"
878459,jimmer,2014-10-27 19:04:00,2730,Regs are pretty clear for the dam in coby. You can fish there until the end of November 15th and can't fish there again until the Friday after the second Saturday in May.
878461,Dutch01,2014-10-27 19:13:00,1431,That's what I read too.  I will check those signs this weekend and I also sent an email to the MNR for clarification.  Wonder if they will reply by Friday when I leave for Coby....
878462,jimmer,2014-10-27 19:20:00,2730,"They have signs here in Lindsay, but there are usually dates put on them in the spring."
878468,Dave Bailey,2014-10-27 19:39:00,1641,"Seems we get into these wrangles every week. Anybody ever thought to just call the MNR? I'm sure they have a phone number. Heck, the government might have splurged and hooked them up to that interweb thingy.  Maybe we should get a CO on the board as a consultant, pay them off in doughnuts or something, and they can be called upon whenever the subject of regulations comes up."
878486,Sinker,2014-10-27 21:06:00,8692,"Yep, pretty clear to me too.  It is a sanctuary from the second saturday in May until the third saturday....thats what the signs are for. Its not up to the MNR to post signs anywhere, its up to the angler to know the regs for the area they're fishing.  S."

879251,Locnar,2014-11-03 04:36:00,645,Some areas near locks and dams in the kawarthas are fish sanctuaries from nov. 15 to may 15 or something like that. usually the signs have dates written on them
879567,Mister G,2014-11-05 12:53:00,1429,Damn signs............LOL
879597,Dutch01,2014-11-05 17:59:00,1431,"""Sign, sign, everywhere a sign Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?"""
