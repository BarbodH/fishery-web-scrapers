The white flag sign of a deer hopping off. Hmm,maybe I,ll see more. So I start to walk slower and sure enough I see one on the hill.  Healthy doe.     River looked inviting today. I decided to give the bead a work out. Fishing has been tough.  I finally got my first steel on a bead. Not huge but a first. Sorry about the mud. It was a quick land,shot and release.    Weatherman has been on my side for getting out. Lets hope the next 4 days are the same."
