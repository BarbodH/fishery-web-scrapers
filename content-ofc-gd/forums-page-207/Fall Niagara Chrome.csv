879250,miller,2014-11-03 04:34:00,223,"It's been a great start so far hiking the shoreline and hooking up on plenty of fresh chrome, the lower boat drifts are starting to pick up so that'll be the next task!                     And the highlights of the last two trips I've managed a few big girls!    Oh and the first day of the water dropping was quite productive in a different way lol. Found 83 lures between me and a buddy. "
879257,davey buoy,2014-11-03 08:50:00,5505,"What beauty fish and what a even better score of tackle too,holy cow that's awesome!!!. Looks like spoons are the preferred choice,sometimes?  ."
879259,miller,2014-11-03 11:23:00,223,All the fall spoon chuckers for salmon donate them then nov 1st the water drops revealing the bounty! Lol
879261,kenzy31,2014-11-03 12:01:00,261,What a sick-wicked bunch of chrome man! Nice fish That laker is faaaaattt! That must've been fun on a pin lol
879264,BillM,2014-11-03 12:39:00,17367,"Right on man!   You can see a few mutant US stockers in the mix as well, lol!!!   Good score on the lures"
879268,Tim Mills,2014-11-03 13:08:00,476,Nice fish and bonus on the lures
879368,MJL,2014-11-04 01:12:00,2427,Some quality fish right there  Sweet score on the lures! This was the first year I've ever had to fish from behind the trees down in the whirlpool...OPG is doing some crazy stuff with the water
879369,miller,2014-11-04 01:16:00,223,2 Sundays ago? I hiked down and turned right around and went back up lol. Strong west/southwest winds will push the water high but I've never seen it that stupid before.
879370,MJL,2014-11-04 01:24:00,2427,2 Sundays ago? I hiked down and turned right around and went back up lol. Strong west/southwest winds will push the water high but I've never seen it that stupid before.  I fished it a few times this spring. Water went up like normal between 8-10am. Then it went up again at 1:30-2:30pm another 4ft. Definitely not a SW wind issue. On the bright side I still caught fish but a number of anglers lost their tackle boxes.LOL  I'm hoping to make it down soon. Plan to bring some camera equipment that I definitely don't want to have washed away.LOL
879371,miller,2014-11-04 01:26:00,223,"Haha yup first time I ever fished the niagara my jug of sunny d got swept away before I knew it, hadn't even cracked the seal lol. The Niagara can catch you off guard that's for sure!"
879421,Salmonidstalker,2014-11-04 16:28:00,265,They are all stockers in that river.  Nice catch pal!
879428,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-04 17:17:00,8243,"Beauties all. Sorry I really don't wish to hijack a thread but I wonder who could I.D. all the lures on the table?  I have everyone of those oldies I believe, some doubles too. Any opinions on what the rarest lure there is on that table?"
879640,TJC1973,2014-11-05 23:26:00,17,Some great looking steel there. Your doing better from shore than I am in the boat so far!  You still working GT?  Terry
879642,miller,2014-11-05 23:43:00,223,Sure am!
