There is, or was, a camp out there with the name posted above--or it might have been Fishing instead of Fish. It's the one off on an island a few km South of Bass Lake Anyway, I cannot find any contact info on-line. Does anyone know if they are still in business and, if so, what their phone # or e-mail address is? thx "
