879910,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-08 14:42:00,2582,Right on the same street I work on. Went in there ONCE several years ago because I was told they sharpened ice auger blades. My blades where sharper when I took them in then when I got them back. When I took them back a guy came out from the warehouse..supposedly the guy who sharpened them. Although we did not appear to be more then a few years apart in age he kept calling me sonny????? Creepy looking dude missing a few teeth. While we where talking I had an overpowering urge to start playing a Banjo. Never set foot in the place again.
