Looking to replace my existing plastic tank so would have specs to start with. Looking for 8 to 12 gallons and low permeating plastic if possible. Nothing off the shelf aftermarket will fit from the specs I've seen.  I can source one from the US but trying to keep costs down with shipping etc.  Thanks"
879360,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-04 00:42:00,10439,Have you checked West Marine? They have a lot of different tanks listed. Hopefully one will fit your needs.  http://www.westmarine.com/fuel-tanks

879403,wkrp,2014-11-04 13:33:00,656,Have you thought of an aluminum tank. Any good welding shop can make one up to your specs.
879411,scugpg,2014-11-04 14:22:00,1373,I guess they make me a bit nervous with the grounding needed and being metal. The weight would be double too?

879420,bare foot wader,2014-11-04 16:23:00,1354,"buddy went to a local hdpe plastic dealer/shop, seemed like they had at least a dozen or so tanks ready for pickup, all custom fit..must be somebody in GTA who could do that, wasn't the cheapest option but was perfect for his boat and got extra capacity"
879448,craigdritchie,2014-11-04 19:23:00,1586,"I'd suggest you call Scepter Marine in Scarborough, Ontario. They make a ton of stuff beyond what you see on their website, including OEM tanks for many boat manufacturers.  Phone is (416) 883-0777 and email for customer service is [emailÂ protected].  They won't sell directly to you, but if it is an oddball item that's not part of the normal inventory they can arrange for you to order it from a nearby dealer.  Can't hurt to ask. Scepter makes the best tanks going, by far."
