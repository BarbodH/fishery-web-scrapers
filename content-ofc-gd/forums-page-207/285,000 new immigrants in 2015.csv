879455,Tim Mills,2014-11-04 20:25:00,476,Some immigrants come for the education system I taught a kid from Egypt. The parents came here so they're kids could get educated. Mom worked at Tim Horton's. Dad worked at a Petro Canada.  They lived in a large 3000 square ft house in Oakville. They rented out half the house and lived in the other half. The kid I taught became a cabinetmaker. The brother went into Sciences and became a DR. His parents still have they're house in Alexandria and will go back to live there as soon as the DR son finishes his studies.

879641,creditmaster,2014-11-05 23:38:00,190,"Roy, I don't have a PROBLEM with immigration! My problem is in understanding how we as a country are going to be able to continue being one of the best places to live if we continue to bring in more people than we can support!  As Spincast put it: Maybe instead of having a doctor drive us to the hospital in taxi cab to wait for 5, 10 hours or several days, he or she could treat us upon arrival?  Even between provinces many accreditations are not recognized never mind foreign countries. Some of these countries have better education than we do!  Our health care system is considered one of the best but how much longer will that be the case if we bring in more people than our economy can support? We are currently ranked 24 out of 34 countries for the highest tax rates (not the right end of the scale to be at). How much more can we give before we have nothing left to give?  I have been working since I was 15 years old, I am 68. For 53 years I have contributed and paid my taxes but today my combined pensions are under $1000.00 a month, a new immigrant coming to Canada gets more than I do, why? OMYGOSH i totally agree  i im the son of a direct immigrant but that  was 50 yrs ago  the government needs to get their prioritys straight i have nothing against immigrants just agree with clliff the need to put a cap like maybe 50,000 per year but also they have people in the government taking shortcuts for immigrants letting them in like a swarm!!!"

879236,ccmtcanada,2014-11-03 01:18:00,7971,"Cliff.  I hear you.  This is not a ""simple"" problem.  The other kind of immigration is Family Sponsored immigration.  There is no job requirement here.  Many times someone will enter on a work visa and work to get established and then apply to bring their families over once that's done.  A young wife may come with the kids and she is considered unemployed.   Or say I had a relative who I brought over from Japan because they are immediate family.  They would also be considered unemployed by the calculation of they are looking.  What's not widely known is that for a family sponsorship to occur, the person in Canada sponsoring must prove they can care for them financially.  They are not eligible for welfare when they come.  They also just pass a medical and do not inmediately get Ohip coverage.  I think when you strip those numbers from the 13% you'll see it's much smaller a proportion.  That's my understanding anyways.  People who come on work visas...their jobs aren't considered ""new jobs"" as they typically replace someone who has left the position.   The job isn't ""open"" if that makes sense.  That's why there are more immigrants than jobs created."

879246,scuro2,2014-11-03 03:56:00,904,How many of us are immigrants or 1st generation Canadian? Did you parents or grandparents speak another language? My first words were likely not English. My parents came with little and no set job. I got beat up in school because I was different. My father became a Dr and us brothers became successful professionals. As a family I am sure we have paid well over a million in taxes.   We still need immigrants until the girls start popping them out again like in the 50's and 60's.    Woah...an annual growth rate of 1.1 percent projected to go .9% over the next fifty years. What a stupid thread.
879248,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-03 04:12:00,8243,"Big Cliff I believe you do have a problem with immigration policy, no problem, if anyone would be able to outline the policy I'm all ears. Refugee status is something entirely different. And from what your initial post says perhaps a problem with the immigrants. Something about culture and traditions I think you said. I can't use the quote feature here. Our culture and traditions or thiers?  I'm a first generation Canadian from my Mothers side, she's American, both parents of Italian decent, father born here and raised in Italy so second generation with an asterisk. I remember a grade school teacher complaining about all that foreign food that reeks of tomato and garlic in the hallway in her apartment building and looked at me. I was mouthy even at 11, so I asked her why she has to live in an Apt and if she bought a house she wouldn't smell it and why was she at Viscas Restaurant last month eating smelly Italian food with tomato and garlic, and if she didn't spend money on restaurants she could buy a home like my immigrant family did.  You did answer your own question about all the facilities that will be needed to serve all these immigrants, we will build them as we are everywhere in Hamilton, get paid to do so and pay taxes on our income to provide the bricks and mortar. I am no economist but I call that economic groth. And we will build more for future immigrants."

My Oma and Opa decided long ago that Europe was no place to raise a family ( Netherlands) post war Holland... so they packed their belongings and moved my father and uncles to Canada landing in Montreal.... Seems alot of immigrants landed there during this time.  My Opa was an engineer ... Working for various companies.  Several years later would up working at Darlington for Ontario hydro.  They became citizens as did my father and uncles. They saw themselves as Canadians first, and embraced Canadian ideals.. With a dutch heritage. Being  Catholic this was the norm...  As for my mother... We know she is adopted... And we know she is from Portugal.... (We have the papers) However she wishes not to find her birth parents or possible siblings (this info is redacted from the papers)... As she fears it will upset the balance of things. This is her choice and we respect it.   Needless to say us as kids will never know the hardships our elders experienced... A war torn Europe or an unwanted child they all came here for a better life... A chance at something better.  But everyone needs to remember one thing in our opinion... This is our land, not your land. Leave our Canadian customs and traditions alone.  Even immigrants such as my family understood... And embraced. If we wanted the crap life in holland we would have stayed there!  Our family assimilated and adapted... The fear is a lot of these new comers are not at all interested in adapting.

The large majority of immigrants come here so that they can work and raise families in a system that is not entirely corrupt and allows them to create a decent life for their children.  If you want to see where the true problem lies, its canadian's that sit in public and affordable housing claiming that they have a right to live in government subsidized housing while not working.  Every person that says ""affordable housing is a right"" they are dead on, shelter is a basic human need so i better see them on the first bus up to Flin Flon to go work at the mine and buy some affordable houses."

Heck, they didn't even speak the same language as each other when they met. They both worked the tobacco fields of southern Ontario; hard work for sure. In the neighbourhood where  I grew up, we were the exception... all my friends and neighbours were already 2nd gen and I got a lot of heat from them regarding my mom and dad's accents. Our next door neighbor actually called my dad a ""deepie"". They didn't like the fact that here we were, new Canadians living in the same neighbourhood as these 2nd,3rd or 4th generation Canadians. I guess they just couldn't understand that my folks were more than willing to work hard for a better life for their family. My Dad taught himself to read English and never took a dime he did not earn from anyone. I suspect that the vast majority of new Canadians have exactly the same desires coming to this country. Yes exceptions always exist, but that is what they are, exceptions. HH"

879431,glen,2014-11-04 17:38:00,2641,People that live here don't have enough kids to increase the population. The planet is over populated.  So maybe Canadians are doing a good thing.  The government needs immigrants to increase the amount they have to spend.  Maybe they should do better money management.  It would be great if the reason we have immigrants is to have stories like HH told us. I have heard many great stories like his and it makes me very happy.  A lot of the people are saying they will return to their homeland when they are done working here. I guess canada is just a place to make money.  If canada is so great how come more immigrants don't come here from successful countries.

879178,ccmtcanada,2014-11-02 19:51:00,7971,"It's been a while since I took sociology, but I do remember  the following.  Canada's natural growth rate (births minus deaths), although still positive has been declining since the 1950s.  Our population on average is also aging....meaning more of our population is no longer in child bearing years or working age.   Couple that with people having on average less children and we are headed for economic disaster if we do not have immigration to help our country grow now.   Canada also has a very low population density so we have the ""space"" to grow.  So here's the situation.  Our natural increase is declining. Our population is aging.  In order to take care of our aging population we need growth in the work force to stimulate the economy and generate taxes to pay for everything from health care to pensions.  We cannot do this without immigration.  We need those increases (increase the tax base) to fund our future.  In order to immigrate to Canada, part of the process is to make sure people are healthy at the time of application so they do not burden out health care system right away.  There are designated doctors who are qualified to do these physicals by country around the world.  There are basically two ways to immigrate....one is a family application and the other is work.  The family application happens when a Canadian citizen sponsors someone living abroad to come live in Canada.  Or if a Canadian wants to marry a citizen of another country.  The other is work...where they must prove they are in demand because of a shortage in Canada.  They must also have a minimum amount of their own money so they can support themselves once here.  Without immigration now, we would be in BIG trouble a few decades from now....declining workforce because natural increase is slowing, people having less kids on average coupled with aging population means we need to beef up on immigration now.  Hope this made some sort of sense...."

It's a huge positive that medicine has increased lives longer than ever before but it comes at a societal cost.  This is a world wide problem for all countries who are considere ""advanced"".  That meaning as education increases, people having less and less children etc.  This is a thread about immigration in Canada....how to solve the population issue as a whole has been studied by sociologists for decades and there is no true answer yet.

We have thousands of migrant foreign labourers on our farms doing the work that  born and raised Canadians refuse to do. There are a lot of menial jobs that our native sons refuse to do in many industries. At least the majority of immigrants understand the idea of earning one's keep.  Far too many youth in this country have this sense of ""entitlement"", that the nation has to look after them. The failing birth rate is an easy fix. Just do like Duplessis in the 50's.

879220,craigdritchie,2014-11-02 23:27:00,1586,"It's been a while since I took sociology, but I do remember the following.  Canada's natural growth rate (births minus deaths), although still positive has been declining since the 1950s. Our population on average is also aging....meaning more of our population is no longer in child bearing years or working age. Couple that with people having on average less children and we are headed for economic disaster if we do not have immigration to help our country grow now. Canada also has a very low population density so we have the ""space"" to grow.  So here's the situation. Our natural increase is declining. Our population is aging. In order to take care of our aging population we need growth in the work force to stimulate the economy and generate taxes to pay for everything from health care to pensions.  We cannot do this without immigration. We need those increases (increase the tax base) to fund our future. In order to immigrate to Canada, part of the process is to make sure people are healthy at the time of application so they do not burden out health care system right away. There are designated doctors who are qualified to do these physicals by country around the world. There are basically two ways to immigrate....one is a family application and the other is work. The family application happens when a Canadian citizen sponsors someone living abroad to come live in Canada. Or if a Canadian wants to marry a citizen of another country. The other is work...where they must prove they are in demand because of a shortage in Canada. They must also have a minimum amount of their own money so they can support themselves once here.  Without immigration now, we would be in BIG trouble a few decades from now....declining workforce because natural increase is slowing, people having less kids on average coupled with aging population means we need to beef up on immigration now.  Hope this made some sort of sense....  Big Cliff - there's your answer ... ccmt put it as clearly and as sensibly as it comes.  Since we're not producing enough future tax payers of our own, someone has to drive the economy. We need people to work and earn a living, pay taxes, and keep the machine running. With our birthrates not able to keep up, these bodies have to come from somewhere.  Yes, a few immigrants will turn out to be undesirable idiots. But can't we say exactly the same thing for people who are born here?  The reality is that the vast majority of immigrants - just like the vast majority of people born here - go on to have successful lives, and positively contribute to our economy and our society.  Remember, most of these people choose to live here because they recognize what an amazing country Canada really is. What saddens me is the number of people who are born here who fail to appreciate that."
879222,lew,2014-11-02 23:37:00,12766,"But can't we say exactly the same thing for people who are born here?  I have a cousin about 70 years old who was born in Canada,  has been on welfare her entire life and has never worked a single day since the day she was born.  She was never married yet had 6 kids by 6 different men.  She told me I was a sucker & a complete idiot for working hard.  I'll take just about any immigrant over this lazy piece of garbage."
879227,Big Cliff,2014-11-03 00:26:00,6899,"And ccmt did put it very well, it still doesn't answer my question though; if we are bringing in more people than we are creating jobs in a given year, who is going to end up paying to support these new people?  Our health care system is over loaded today, where are we going to find enough hospital beds and health care professionals to care for this huge increase? One of the reasons that Canadian families have cut back on the number of children they have is because they just can't support more children.  Bringing in more people is just a short term fix, there will be a saturation point then all heck will break loose!"
879230,ccmtcanada,2014-11-03 00:42:00,7971,"The people who come here on work visas already have jobs lined up in areas where Canada has a shortage.  This is a requirement before they are given permanent residence in Canada.  They also must have a minimum amount of cash on hand when they land in Canada. They will support themselves and pay taxes like everyone else who works here.  A person who is granted permanent residence also is not able to use health care for free or any welfare of any kind for a certain waiting period.  I can't remember how long that is.  But that stops the people who try to come with the intent of abusing our system.  There is a perception that we let anyone in and immediately give them welfare and healthcare.  This is not the case at all.  Yes there are some bad apples, but the majority of them support themselves and their families."
879232,Big Cliff,2014-11-03 00:54:00,6899,"Cliff, I know you to be a very wise and well educated man and if you say that this works then I guess it will.  It is a fact though that 13.7% of new immigrants are unemployed. To be considered unemployed they have to be looking for work but not have found it so they didn't come here with jobs already lined up.  It is also a fact that we are only creating 156,000 new jobs a year and the number of new immigrants is almost double that. How long do you think we can sustain bringing in twice as many new people as we are creating jobs? It just doesn't make sense but perhaps my old school math doesn't work anymore!"
879233,Old Man,2014-11-03 00:56:00,822,"You hit the nail on the head. With out immigration, a country with Canada's demographics would soon flounder economically."
879123,Big Cliff,2014-11-02 12:25:00,6899,"http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/politics/canadian-government-seeks-to-bring-in-285-000-immigrants-in-2015/article/412401  Now, the birth rate for all of Canada 2013/2014 is 385,937 and the Conservatives want to bring in 285,000 new immigrants in 2015, even if we subtract the deaths; 256,721 that is 414,216 new mouths to feed in one year. That is 414,216 new bodies entering our health care system in one year (and you wonder why you have to wait 5+ hours to be seen in emergency).    Since the death rate in Canada for 2013/2014 was 256,721; and since the average life expectancy in Canada is 80, I think it might be safe to extrapolate that the majority of deaths would be people born about 80 years ago (established Canadians). That would leave us with a net growth of 129,216 established Canadian families but more than twice that in new immigrants. (which might explain why we are losing ground when it comes to our customs and traditions)    Now I understand that Canada is a land of immigrants, heck my great grandfather emigrated here from England in the early 1800s. I don’t have anything against someone wanting to come to Canada to try to make a better life for themselves or their families. What I am having trouble understanding is why are we allowing so many new immigrants in?    We have kids graduating college and university that end up having to take jobs working at or slightly above minimum wage because that is all they can find. Over the past year the labour market has only added 156,000 new jobs (according to the Canadian Labour Congress) and the majority of those jobs were in accommodation and food services, a notoriously low paid and precarious sector.    The unemployment rate for recent immigrants (less than 5 years) stood at 13.7%, compared to 6.5% for Canadian born workers, (according to the Canadian Labour Congress). If that is accurate, it means that about 39,000 of these new immigrants are not going to find work, who is going to have to pay for them?    I think it is wonderful that we want to help those less fortunate than ourselves but I also believe that we have to make sure that we take care of our Canada first!     "
879124,outllaw,2014-11-02 12:34:00,1232,"agreed big cliff. immigration years back meant...looking for a new homeland and opportunity. that meant finding work. the immigration social programs are a  gravytrain in todays world.. sadly our own voted polisticians have put canadiens in the place we are now... many immigrants have learned how to milk the system. I am not against immigration at all.BUT what about established canadien families. don't we come first.,before filling the gaps with,slackers"
879125,spincast,2014-11-02 12:55:00,3279,"Dig a little deeper and you may find that the government's own policies confound and contribute to the problem. It is not easy to get accepted into Canada. The qualifications and skill sets that are considered are few and far between, and driven (by and large) by skilled occupations for which there is an identified need. Yet once the applicants go through the difficult and lengthy process of being accepted, their qualifications are not accepted by the regulatory bodies that oversee the very occupations they were brought to the country to fill. We have all heard the stories of the Drs driving taxis for instance. I have seen this first hand in several of the immigrant communities I have had exposure to. Statisticians working night shift stocking grocery shelves; Doctors, engineers doing low paying entry level jobs because there is no way for them to have their accreditations accepted. Maybe if the government spent a little bit of time at the back end of the process, we wouldn't find ourselves in this situation? Maybe instead of having a doctor drive us to the hospital in taxi cab to wait for 5, 10 hours or several days, he or she could treat us upon arrival?"
879126,ketchenany,2014-11-02 12:58:00,3229,"That's 285,000 more votes they get to stay in.

Yes let's help but we should be first."

If they(Gov't) actually screened out the garbage they're letting in, we'd have a whole lot less burden on our systems.  I ball refugees and imigrants in the same bag.  On the other hand I know an ex Brit Military member that took well over 4 years to get his paperwork stamped to stay in Canada legally.  He wants to work, he has a trade, he's not lazy, he's not sick, he wants to contribute."
879133,Big Cliff,2014-11-02 13:29:00,6899,"Roy, I don't have a PROBLEM with immigration! My problem is in understanding how we as a country are going to be able to continue being one of the best places to live if we continue to bring in more people than we can support!  As Spincast put it: Maybe instead of having a doctor drive us to the hospital in taxi cab to wait for 5, 10 hours or several days, he or she could treat us upon arrival?  Even between provinces many accreditations are not recognized never mind foreign countries. Some of these countries have better education than we do!  Our health care system is considered one of the best but how much longer will that be the case if we bring in more people than our economy can support? We are currently ranked 24 out of 34 countries for the highest tax rates (not the right end of the scale to be at). How much more can we give before we have nothing left to give?  I have been working since I was 15 years old, I am 68. For 53 years I have contributed and paid my taxes but today my combined pensions are under $1000.00 a month, a new immigrant coming to Canada gets more than I do, why?"

I worked since 16 never outa work. have done some incredibly hard work. unloaded boxcars for 1.25 per hour. and once again paid my way. wheres my pension fund sent too. maybe the policticians that reap kazillions should look at 2 terms and a free pension... maybe the lampreys in Ottawa can re-jig ,who gets what. afterall canadiens have less children. I grew up in the era of 5-10kids in a home. the goverments slapped us outa that. now we need more immigration.funny how Canada is losing its CANADIEN heritage."

879147,Crazy Ivan,2014-11-02 15:15:00,184,None of the people (agency temps) I work with come from countries with higher standards of living. I would guess that most new immigrants don't.

879166,fishnguy,2014-11-02 17:49:00,96,"A great case study on a country with unfavorable (aging) demographics that closed its doors to immigration would be Japan.  Net result was a 20 year stagnation in the economy, falling asset prices (look and land and stock market values today in Japan vs the early 90s), and massive government debt as an aging population plus falling tax base (i.e. higher dependency ratio) gutted government coffers.  Canada's demographics aren't quite as daunting, but the net result of closing doors to immigration would still be very negative."
