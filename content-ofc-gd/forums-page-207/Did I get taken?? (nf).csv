No point wasting 700 ml of gear oil at $24.95/ litre if it's still like new.  So, this is new to me.  Check the gear oil and leave it in?  What would be a bad sign?  Water would settle to the bottom I presume  I might put 50 hrs/yr.  Can it be left in for 2 yrs?"
879511,irishfield,2014-11-05 01:46:00,26272,"Yes.. if it's sat for a period of time water is heavier than oil and will come out first... or the oil will look milky. If it comes out looking like it went in, it's generally fine after low usage. I generally do my 9.9's lower unit oil every second year. I always do my 275's."
879518,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-05 02:15:00,8243,"I used to get Fishmasters to winterize the 115 Merc and shrinkwrap for around $275.00, I learned how to winterize it last year and it's so simple if I can do it anyone can. Watched UTube videos and watched it done once on a pals. I provided the lower gear lube and fogging spray. I don't know if any plumbers anti freeze was used in the livewells and bilge. I didn't see that done on UTube or the pals boat but did it on my own last year. I thought I came up with that on my own, heck I was going to patent the procedure! LOL. I even changed the fuel line and bulb!!!! It all took at least 45 minutes, no more than an hour including removing the battery for a first timer last year. It was 225 for the shrinkwrap this year from Fishmasters.  Yes you got fleeced, that price is ludicrous even if they tuned it up and changed the fuel filter, I did that too on my own, if you knew my mechanical dexterity you all would be amazed."
879552,Mister G,2014-11-05 10:51:00,1429,"Did my 60 hp E-TEC in the driveway the other day. Stabil has already been added to both tanks. Connected hose to outboard port on the back of the engine. Turned on the water, put throttle all the way up while keeping motor in neutral, start motor and run 15 seconds, now put throttle all the way down and run another 15 seconds. You can observe the check lights going through it's testing while doing this. Now return the throttle all the way up and engine RPM's will increase somewhat. Engine will run for about 1 minute and shut itself off. The engine is now fogged and ready for winter storage.  See here..........     But of course a check on the lower unit oil must be done too. I also grease ALL zerk fittings on the engine and also do the wheel bearings.  One more thing, I add moth balls to each compartment AND under the engine hood. I use small plastic bags with holes cut in them to hold the moth balls.  Next week I will take the boat to it's indoor winter resting place. They allow me to keep the boat plugged in so no need to remove the 2 batteries as I have a on-board charging system to maintain my power sources.  Total cost under $10 especially since I already have the Stabil and grease on hand."
879557,jbailey,2014-11-05 12:05:00,866,"""remove boat drain plugs""  wow"
879609,jimmer,2014-11-05 18:52:00,2730,"I would actually want to check the work to make sure everything was done properly. I remember one year bringing in my outboard to be winterized (I usually did it myself). I paid for the work that they said was done (felt I was over charged), which included changing a prop shaft seal. Put it on my boat in the spring and the lower end blew a month later because they didn't put oil in it. I had no way to prove it, but......... Definitely learn to do it yourself, it's easier than you think. Went to another marina to see how much to fix, they quoted $2000, which was more than the motor was worth at the time. I looked around a little and found a lower unit for $250 and replaced the seized (I mean seized LOL) unit myself. I don't want to offend any marine mechanics on here, but I have never had a good experience in this field. Not including all the horror stories that I have heard over the years."
879623,smally21,2014-11-05 20:54:00,993,"Sorry to see this sort of thing go on..650 would be more reasonable if there was shrink wrapping and 4 months of storage thrown in.  The job should be around 250$..maybe a little more, nothing comes cheap in marineland.  My other concern about work like this is it is very hard to prove any of it was done..I mean, a tech checks the lower unit oil and its perfect..so why change it? Same with prop removal..short of finding 1000' of mono around the shaft who is to say the work was done?  Im only bringing that into the equation because a guy that charges 3X the going rate for 45 minutes worth of work is the same guy that might just say ahh skip it..there is no ""evidence"" a motor has been fogged.  It would take longer to fill out that invoice than it would to winterize the boat. Don't forget this takes Joe boatowner a few hours..these guys have every tool and trick sitting  out ready on their workbench..and should be twice as fast."

Believe me I'm not defending this shop; because it does sound like the OP was taken advantage of. This kind of thing hurts all of us in the service industry. But in an honest shop, why wouldn't they charge a flat rate to do this winterizing; regardless of how long it actually took the tech to preform all said work? Like in the quote above ""every tool and trick""; no one gave that tech the tools or the years of experience to be able to do the job quickly and proficiently. I have spent thousands of dollars on equipment that is not necessarily needed to perform a said job; but that tool has made the job easier and faster. If the flat rate pays 1 hour to do a job and with this tool I can do it in 3/4s of an hour; I'm sorry the customer gets charged the hour; that's business.  Dan."
879699,doubleheader,2014-11-06 14:02:00,497,"If the winterization includes engine oil, filter, lower unit lube (actually changing it), prop maintenance, grease, gas treatment, and treating plumbing, all things typically associated with winterization, then a typical cost for a 4 stroke would be around $250.00. If they dropped the lower unit things can get pricey in a hurry, and the $650 is not completely unreasonable. As a customer I would have an expectation that i approve anything additional, such as dropping the lower unit, before the work is completed."

879082,fishnguy,2014-11-01 23:24:00,96,"Thanks for the insights.  I'll definitely be looking into winterizing it myself next year.  Was a bit intimidated with it being a brand new (to me) boat.  Didn't want to screw something up, but I gather it's pretty straight forward.  I've contacted the marina to make them aware of this thread and again to reiterate that the price seems very excessive.  The icing on the cake is that since the spring, I've dropped at least 7k on that marina buying all my electronics, trolling motor, downriggers, etc through them and having them installed.  I guess that was before the new management, but you'd think they would at least want to try to keep their existing client base."

878957,fishnguy,2014-11-01 00:33:00,96,So I'm gathering $100 in parts/supplies plus a couple hours max at $95/hr.  That's a heck of a lot less than $650.  MAN!!!!!
878958,irishfield,2014-11-01 00:33:00,26272,"Okay, so they did 4.5 hours of work... what was included in the service? Did they do spark plugs? Did they check valve clearances, etc or simply change the oils and possibly fog the engines? Did they put antifreeze thru the livewells or at least vacuum / blow the lines and pumps out?"
878959,irishfield,2014-11-01 00:34:00,26272,..Time for me to stop building and servicing aircraft for $65/hr....
878960,chris.brock,2014-11-01 00:38:00,4053,"Next fall, do it yourself, post a refresher question here on what to do, and the guys will chime in, piece of cake!"
878961,strik,2014-11-01 00:40:00,175,Pm sent  I live in the same area as you ..  I would be asking what they did for the 650..  I do know of one person that was over charged from a place in the area. When we went in to ask what the charges were for they realized it was the wrong person they fixed everything. It was then my friend realized someone in the area had the same name as him .
878962,fishnguy,2014-11-01 00:40:00,96,"Looking at the bill now.  $456 for labor.  $115 for parts and supplies.  Plus taxes.  Here's the full checklist of what was done:-Put in gas stabilizer -Run engine until warm -Drain oil -Replace filter and oil on 115hp motor -Run engine, check oil level -Fog engine -Drain and fill lower unit -Remove prop, check and lube -Lube outdrive -Put outdrive up -Disconnect battery -Clean up and put canvas back on  I'm not mechanically inclined, but that doesn't strike me as almost 5 hours of work."
878963,Pigeontroller,2014-11-01 00:51:00,2793,"Yup, you got taken...All easy stuff to do yourself."
878965,Terry,2014-11-01 00:52:00,14456,wow  they saw you coming
878966,Fisherman,2014-11-01 00:55:00,7201,"Man they sent a taxi for you, that must have been an extra large hose they got you with.  I don't believe for one second that the lubricants alone add up to more than $100.  (4 litres of 4 stroke synthetic, 1 litre of gear oil, small can of startron fuel stab, oil filter about $15).  Put outdrive up? What the heck, it's an outboard.  Disconnect the battery,  oh boy, that's real difficult.  Lube the outdrive,  hmmm, maybe 2-3 zerks, 2 shots in each one.   I'd rather sit on a nest of red ants bare butt than get anything serviced there."
878967,fishnguy,2014-11-01 00:59:00,96,It immediately stuck me as very off and I certainly questioned them on it.  I had small kids in the car and was already late and it has be stored tomorrow so I wasn't in the position to push too hard at the time.  I'll be back there tomorrow.  I'll let everyone know how it goes.
878968,irishfield,2014-11-01 01:00:00,26272,Bring it over here next year and I'll give you a 30% OFC discount off what you paid this year... I'll even throw in the antifreeze and do your livewells! Doesn't sound like they touched those.... so you'd better have a good look for water in them! (btw I'm joking on the price!)  Next year run stabil through your gas when you think it might be your last trip out. That would skip that part and the engine running. Better it has sat before draining anyhow instead of running the oil through the motor one last time. My Verado has to have sat idle for over an hour before removing the oil filter...
878969,misfish,2014-11-01 01:02:00,29133,"You could of paid for my fuel up there ,got the job done for 1/2 that.  LESSON LEARNED.  Next year you will do it yourself. Next time ask the family here. Thats what were here for."
878970,misfish,2014-11-01 01:04:00,29133,Or go see Wayne.LOL
878971,Burtess,2014-11-01 01:04:00,901,"Don't know anything about costs of winterizing a boat (since I don't have one) but I would let this thread fester a bit and then print them a copy  and show it to them, and let them know that you will post where you had the service done...... see what they say to that lol... good luck.  Don't feel too bad about being taken advantage of though... probably has happened to most of us!  Burt"
878972,captpierre,2014-11-01 01:09:00,2521,"I have same engine.  Do it for about $80 in supplies myself  What does ""Lube Outdrive and put it up"" mean?"
878973,strik,2014-11-01 01:10:00,175,What some fine easy others find hard..  No issue in letting someone else do it.  The issues is getting screwed no way it should have cost that.  The sad thing is the place that did is under new owenership this year .. Sad to see this is were they are headed.. With fishnguy permission I know I will be calling and asking how much to winter my boat   If they get enough complaints it might help or they will just take the money and run..
878974,bigbuck,2014-11-01 01:11:00,2449,"Go on iboats.com, you can download the manufacturers shop manuals that will outline exactly what you need to do for your outboards, both engine and lower. Everyone here can help you out on getting the rest of the work done, ie. winterizing the livewells. Too much for what they did. Def give them a piece of your mind. It should have been shrinkwrapped for that price. Winterizing an i/o which is a lot more involved than an outboard runs 350 or so. If they do not do anything for you, make sure you post the name of the place everywhere you can and warn people of their business practices."
878975,Terry,2014-11-01 01:11:00,14456,most likely grease in 2 nipples  and trim  engine to 45 deg angle
878977,fishnguy,2014-11-01 01:17:00,96,"Yup.  Like I said, I'll be back there tomorrow.  I'll scan the whole bill and post it if nothing happens.  Appreciate all the comments."
878985,wallyboss,2014-11-01 01:38:00,1095,I am not mechanically inclined at all.  But winterizing my boat I do that myself. It's not hard at all. Google it and I am sure there are videos for your motor. Get all your stuff ready before hand.
