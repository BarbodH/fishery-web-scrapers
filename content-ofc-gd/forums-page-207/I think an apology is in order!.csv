879911,phin#9,2014-11-08 15:24:00,13,Never apologize for concern over family or sticking up for your country. Two of the most important things in life. Good luck.
879933,Toronto_Angler,2014-11-08 20:39:00,698,"Cliff, I've been positing here for years and have always admired what a good person you came across as. I've always respected you as a member here and source of information. Your posts were a little out of character but we've all seen worse here and have probably done worse! Its understandable with the stresses you have been going through and I wish you nothing but the best. I know we don't know each other personally but I appreciate everything you have done for this community. God bless"
879994,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-09 03:29:00,8243,"Well said TA, very well said. We've all said something we wish we could take back, especially here sometimes, guilty as charged. Cliff is the man, if he was Italian he would be the ""Don""."
879602,TJQ,2014-11-05 18:27:00,7806,Take care Cliff... No worries here...

879632,Nipfisher,2014-11-05 21:42:00,2449,You're one of the many good guys (and girls) on this site Cliff.
879634,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-05 22:31:00,8243,"Apologize, exactly for what? An opinion from a man of respect? We are of the same era and age. We are at that age now when I hear from an old friend I don't say "" Hey how are you doing?"" Now it seems I have to say "" What's wrong?"" when I pick up the phone and it usually isn't good. We don't seem to get any good news anymore. Just like the terrible news you just gave us, it sucks, absolutely sucks. We have never met personally but it feels like I've known you for years and it chokes me up to read the pain in your writing tonight. There isn't anything I can say here other than I love you man. Be tough, your family needs you more now than probably any other time in your life. Apologize,,,,,,, I'll give you an apologize. Enough said."
879643,tb4me,2014-11-05 23:46:00,3295,Hang tough Cliff. You have the power of many friends here..Some you have never met..Myself included. You and your family will be in my prayers my man..

I've had my fair share of family issues and sometimes getting one thing off your plate can help.  Take care... family first."

I seem to have plenty of time right now because I also have non Hodgkin's Lymphoma the aggressive B cell type and have been battling since July. I believe that I am on the winning end of it now as my chemotherapy will come to an end in January and I should be able to get back to work. My wife and I have become extremely edcuated with cancer as it scared the living crap out of us all. I have never been ill except for the yearly cold etc. and this crap blind sided us. If you need to ask any questions Cliff feel free to call us, send me a pm and I will forward you our number and either Laurie and I will be pleased to answer any questions or concerns that you have. I had 2 tumours in my body one on the side of my neck the size of a tennis ball which is now gone with chemo and the other which is quite large in my stomach. Next week I will be going for a CT scan to see how that is progressing with the meds etc.  I have found that todays medical staff have a huge knowledge with dealing with cancer and the success rate is quite appreciative. I went from 50% probablility of success to 80% so I do like the odds that I have now. Rest assured that your daughter will be taken care of as medicine has come along ways in the past 20 years.  We will also pray on your families behalf and a speedy recovery for your daughter.  Regards,Sam  ps I have saved a bundle on hair shampoo and cream rinse"

Sorry for your family, hope things get better.I strive to do the right thing most of the time, and give myself the freedom to fail.  Without that small freedom I/we can find ourselves paralyzed with fear.Entropy"
879554,Big Cliff,2014-11-05 11:30:00,6899,"I am sorry if I haven’t seemed myself lately, I haven’t been myself!  A lot of things have been piling up and I think the stress and fatigue have made me lash out when I normally would have looked at things with a much more positive and sensitive attitude.  Our daughter was recently diagnosed with non Hodgkin’s lymphoma; she is only 38 and handling it like a trooper. Me, I am having a harder time of it. Any of you with kids know how helpless a dad can feel when you can’t fix things for your kids.  This past fall Sue developed more heart issues and because of her previous heart surgeries there were a lot of complications. They operated on her on Monday but had to abort the operation because things started to go badly. They were able to resolve one of the issues but not the other so she is left with her heart only pumping about 30% of what it should be.  You have no idea how many times I wake up during the night and reach over to see if she is still breathing.  Our police officers are getting gunned down in the streets, our kids are getting stabbed and shot in our schools, our soldiers are getting killed on Canadian soil by an enemy we can’t even see. This isn’t the Canada I was born and grew up in!  The Canada I grew up in a fight in school resulted in a bloody nose; you didn’t mess with the Police, they were respected; and a soldier could wear his/her uniform anywhere without fear of being targeted by some nut.  Yes, it does bother me that we have made so many changes to our way of life, things like the Lord’s Prayer, Christmas pageants, standing at attention and singing O’Canada at the start of the school day. These were all part of growing up for me, they were a way of life and it was a good life. I have watched as we have gone from saying Merry Christmas to “Happy Holidays” because we might offend someone. (Well you know what I mean, there is nothing to be gained by re hashing it all)  Perhaps it is because of my age; might just be the stress and pressure lately; probably a combination but I feel scared for the first time in my life. It feels like everything I love and hold dear to me is in jeopardy and I am helpless to stop it, it makes me angry because I am not use to being helpless.  So, if I have offended or insulted anyone I truly apologize, those of you that know me know that I have never looked down on anyone unless it was to offer them a hand up. I have never judged anyone by their color, race, nationality, or religion.  To the moderators and all than have responded to my recent diatribes; thank you for your tolerance and keeping things civil. Reading and re-reading all the posts and responses provided gave me an opportunity to reflect on a lot of things while I sat in the cardio unit for 12 hours waiting for word on Sue. She is home now and while she has a way to go we are headed in the right direction.  Sincerely Big Cliff"
879555,Joey,2014-11-05 11:51:00,9122,"Gosh Cliff, don't know what to say.   Sorry seems like a pittance of a word for what you are going through.   You take care bud and good luck with your daughter and wife.  Sometimes life throws you a curve ball and apparently you have been thrown 2  I did not notice any bad responses but have not been reading the board like I used to due to my own problems.  Take care and call me or email me if you need to talk.  Joey"

879559,woodenboater,2014-11-05 12:27:00,2277,No need to explain things Cliff and I think the community benefited from the discussion you started. Fingers crossed for your wife and daughter and they're back to 100% in due time  These are very chaotic and fluid times we're living in now but I believe this country can weather and persevere through the minefield that lays ahead.  take care

You are a far better man than too many I have known.  You just focus on that family of yours. Anything you need help with, you just call."
