179235,forrest,2008-03-31 03:12:00,1032,"I noticed that no one has commented on how good a shot that was with the spear gun so I will say it.  That was a good shot! Of course a bow and arrow would have been even more impressive (do those work underwater?)  Well things could be worse,  I last heard that its still legal to shoot pike with a gun in Virginia: http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=100...BM&refer=us  ""To bag her personal best, a 9-pound northern pike, Tina Capsey used an SKS, the semiautomatic Soviet military rifle and precursor to the AK-47. ``If you want big fish,'' said Capsey, 45, the owner of Fish Tales, a restaurant in Swanton, ``you need a big gun.''  forrest"
179241,muskymike,2008-03-31 03:19:00,772," Nothing was said about being okay to bash someone. Taking heat and bashing is completely different. I dont condone bashing. Just like I said, if its legal, its legal, respect it.  Who would want to eat a 25 year old fish anyways though. Not this guy."
179273,KyleM,2008-03-31 06:24:00,218,"ch312, like i stated earlier.......Just because its legal sure as hell dont make it right.  Ill post a little something here from a summer issue of Essox Angler Volume 6 issue 3  Mr Maina, hope you dont mind me posting some of your work!   There are many issues surrounding catch and release fishing. What we mainly cover in this column is the how, with a little bit of why now and then. One issue we havent spent alot of time on is mandatory release-proactive reulations that require release of all fish, a majority of fish, certain size-structure ranges in a fish species etc.  There are many variables-each species and fishery with its own unique conditions-that play a role as to where and how special regs should be established. A total catch and release in many cases is not nessesary or preferable. Often selective harvest is the way to go with many species. And even with a species like Esox Masquinongy, at the top of the food chain, in some waters it could be best to purposely harvest some fish. It all boils down to each individual water's makeup. State wide or provincial regulations dont cut it. And this is why we have folks called fisheries specialists who monitor such things and therefore, we hope, make the correct management calls.  In a very basic sense, protecting certain species of fish from overharvest becomes more important as we move to larger fish, farther up the food chain(and therefore to fish occuring in the lowest densities), and as we move farther north (where fish grow slower) and it becomes less and less feasible to replenish fisheries artificially via stocking. When we are talking about slow growing fish like pike or muskies, or a big fish species twice as slow growing like a lake trout, the time required to rebound from over harvest is measured in decades.  Proactive fisheries management is important. This means protecting a tremendous resource. Sadly, to this day, regulations are reactive in many places. This means things got all screwed up....fisheries got damaged....to the point of angling interest diminishing or flat out ending.....And then there is ""reaction"" with protective regulations, stocking possibly, but sadly its too late. It takes time to fix things.  We felt it important to offer a success story of proactive management here. It works, and it works in all aspects. Its smart!! I can only hope that more folks will take notice of the simple fact that quality fishing is what everyone wants. There are folks who still vehemently rally against proactive regulations (however, they still desire quality fishing). The most popular and pollitically correct arguments heard repeatedly are ""its a tradition"" and we need to ""get kids into fishing"". Of course kids are a great excuse on the surface (stories of the poor kid ""having"" to release his first or biggest fish virtually ruining the childs psyche- an event likely to be the sole cause for a life of video games, drugs and trouble with the law), but the reality is Ive never met a kid who was against catch and release. Usually, when the reasoning behind catch and release is explained, the opposite reaction is far more likely. The messenger is the problem. Kids, even more so than adults, like to watch their bobber go down rather than stare at a floating one on a ""keep all you want"" water. They want to catch big fish. Positive things happen when we learn and adapt....I dont believe using ""tradition"" as a reason to halt this process makes much sense. Esox Angler."
179284,joco,2008-03-31 11:27:00,57,"hi irishfield  true its says ottawa.  but i am in hull accross the bridge,(5sec frome ottawa).  even wit that if its legal to spearfish in ontario in some sector for carp..there would be no prob store a spear gun at home.even in ontario.    like all the guy are been saying there is not mutch off musky....WE need to put them back.(my 2 cents)  anything that can be done to help the musky population as to be done.  great tread by the way.   joco."
179286,ricoboxing,2008-03-31 11:38:00,398,"as long as its legal, and the fish dosent go to waste, i dont see any difference than using a rod and lure to catch some dinner. It's no different than going deer or duck hunting.  At least you get to choose which one you wanna keep, before catching it."
179299,ch312,2008-03-31 12:40:00,1590, thats your opinion. my opinion is there are regs put in place (along with exceptions for different water bodies) and as long as people follow those regs then there shouldnt be a problem. but yet people still feel the need to insult those who choose to keep a legal fish. the way that come people cry about someone killing a musky makes it seem like they think a fish is human or something. get a grip people...  some people just dont get it
179307,muskymike,2008-03-31 13:08:00,772," ch312, you are carrying on far to much about the ""insults and bashing"". No one has been replying with anything along those lines, only for the SAFE RELEASE all Musky.  I am washing my hands of this topic as there is no point in continuing it. As you can see, this community for the most part supports the healthy release of Large fish and the future development of the species, minus the odd few that enjoy getting a rise from the rest of us.  MY OPINION is that you should stop replying before people start complaining to the Mods to have your posts removed. Thats just my opinion. Sorry, seems like opinions are flying all over this topic. haha  Have a great season guys, best of luck to everyone and if you do hook a Musky, think about the Future of Musky fishing, not your stomach. There is an abundance of fish that are decent for eating, thats why the REGS let you keep MULTIPLE fish of these species and NOT ONLY 1.  Great day."
179317,Spiel,2008-03-31 13:35:00,9065, ....That there is some good advice.
179320,fishinggeek,2008-03-31 13:40:00,325,"ch312, I'm with you on this.  Breaking the reg's is always bad.  Some people want their own fishing to be more restrictive, which is great, but they shouldn't project their views and opinions on other law-abiding fishermen.  As individuals, we have individual beliefs on what is right and wrong.  We can't let some of the most ""conservative"" (for lack of a better word) individuals dictate morality.  Post a muskie recipe and you'll get guaranteed objections.  Post a pic of a stringer of northern madtoms and you'll likely get far less reaction, despite the latter being endangered.  What they should do if they want universal change is lobby for regulation changes."

179340,Rich,2008-03-31 14:30:00,3927,What's the diff between killing a few walleye with a spear gun or killing them with a hook and line? At least the speargun puts them right out of their misery.
179341,Ramble,2008-03-31 14:33:00,713,"  My comment isn't regarding the fact that they speared a Musky it's regarding the fact they stommped a mud-hole in the fish to get it off the spear. That isn't showing that fish any respect. Fish i keep are killed quickly as soon as they are in the boat or on the ice if they are keepers.  As far as the fishing reg's in Quebec are concerned.....i wouldn't touch that issue with a 10 foot clown pole!  However i don't believe in spearing, and if it makes you feel better i more strongy object to spearing of sturgeon, then i do the musky.  But being a conservationist at heart, i hate to see big fish killed, except for the odd northern, from trout lakes.  I'm not saying anyone is wrong here LEGALLY, but i'm saying that some of these rules are left over from the days of olde. The morals and ethics of people today will lead to better conservation, and a better fishery in the end. The 1 fish rule for a musky over 40"" i think in a great rule. Same with putting the 50 fish limit on perch, when there used to be no limit.  I think spearing may have it's place for some species such as carp which have a large impact the ecosystem in some places, but for fish like northerns and musky i can't agree with it, apex predators are essential in an ecosystem.  (I'm sorry to all of you who are fans of carp...i engoy them as well but they do more harm then good to our lakes. If you could see it in your heart not to tar and feather me, i'd appretiate that very much.   )   Anyway fellas, it's a good discussion on the morals and ethics of the regualtions. If we can keep the banter civilized we all might learn something here.  -R"
179343,Rich,2008-03-31 14:36:00,3927," Typical 6-8 mentality. Difference of course being that 60% of pike eggs make it to adulthood, whereas about 13% of musky eggs make it to adulthood.  Carp are the same as bass too. Let's bow fish for bass."

I've been a member of this board for 6 or 7 years now and long ago lost track of how many times this exact same discussion/debate/argument has taken place, and everytime it pops up again, it's nearly word for word the same as the last one, with the only difference being the players who participate.  Pretty soon it'll start getting nasty and the name calling will begin, then the mods will have to lock down one more thread in a looooooooooooong list lately.  Musky season will open in a couple months and a new member of this board will post a picture of a musky he kept and then the whole discussion/debate/argument will take place once again, and once again it'll lead to an argument and will again need to be locked up.  Kinda sad really, but still good for a chuckle every few months......."

I remember as a child there were some families around where we fished that loved eating muskies.  They absolutely loved it, and preferred it to any other fish.  I think they BBQ'd the steaks, but I can't remember.  I also don't remember if I tried any of it."

179132,joco,2008-03-30 23:59:00,57,i dont realy like that video about the musky.  dont kill musky at all.  but do spear fish.  its a sport.its like hunting.  i am talking diving spearfishing here..underwater.  for ontario there some species that are legal to catch wit a spear not sher about walleye.  i do no in quebec walleye are ok wit spearguns..not musky/lakers/salmon/sturgeons...not sher abut ont.  there is some states in the usa that are very popular to target musky and sturgeons wit those spear  hand spear in those ice shak..they make big hole and put down a decoy to attract the fish to the holes then they spear them.  spearfishing is a great sports.  and not worst then go hunting deer wit a longbow etc.  i see some fish that have 3 treble hook caught down in there trowt..  .  the sport off spear fishing is not for all.  but people should try it.  but i want to say....at least for my part..if i spear it...i will eat it.  i dont kill for fun...  i see people shoting carp wit bow at long sault just for the fun off it.this is.....  .sad.    joco
179135,joco,2008-03-31 00:01:00,57,i just look back again at the video..i think its all frome the qc.  there is a good groupe off spearfishermans nere montreal that fish walleye.in the st lawrence.  joco
179139,irishfield,2008-03-31 00:14:00,26272,Yes the walleye spearing is in Quebec joco... but I sure hope you aren't using a spear gun or spring gaf to do your spearing while in Ontario or you're breaking the law. Hand spear is legal for white suckers and carp only. Spear gun is illegal to even posses for fishing..so if you do so in Quebec I hope you store it there.
179142,KyleM,2008-03-31 00:16:00,218,Just because its legal dosnt make it right.  Makes me sick to watch that musky video
179148,irishfield,2008-03-31 00:22:00,26272,You're right Kyle.. but we've gotta watch how far we cross our own line that we're not appeasing the PATA people (spelled wrong purposely). The muskie vid is Wisconsin and some native americans to boot. I guess when it comes right down to it.. if you're out for food and not catch and release how you get your limit doesn't really matter IF THE RESOURCE can sustain it and the law is written to allow it. (which it is in both video cases)
179152,Ramble,2008-03-31 00:30:00,713,Not an ounce of respect for that musky.

I'd bet its easier to catch them with fishing tackle! I couldn't dive down 30 ft, let alone hold my breath long enough to wait for a nice eye to pass by in range.  Its definitly not for everyone, but I bet the guys that do it, sure get a rush when thier successful......  Sinker"
179164,ch312,2008-03-31 01:00:00,1590, its a fish. a musky isnt any better than a pike and people spear them all the time...get over it.  that was some cool footage of spear fishing
179167,muskymike,2008-03-31 01:06:00,772," This video make me sick. I can not stand it. I hope it was legal where ever this was. If not ....   Oops should have read this first. haha  Like I though, as long as its legal."
179182,joco,2008-03-31 01:33:00,57,"hi..  irishfield   first i live in qc so no prob to store my spear gun.  plus i never did some off it in ontario even if i stay at 2min frome ontario.  i would not do anything unlegal.  what i spear i eat and its legal.   there some people that went farther then that...they go under water....scuba diving and bring there rods....yes fishing rods. and thats the way they fish.   this is cool and ''''could be legal all over'' but will have to chek this one out,,this is not a normal situation..hahaha  you can see how the fish react and if you are to slow or not...a very good way to lurn how the fish reatc and its reaction.   i will start this this summer..................do some FINTROLLING.......  .  joco"
179184,GbayGiant,2008-03-31 01:36:00,1780," Well, it's a little different, for every 1000 pike there's only one musky (just guessing on those numbers but you get the idea) this is why Muskie guys are so obsessed with releasing them because the population is much smaller than most other fresh water species."
179185,irishfield,2008-03-31 01:36:00,26272, Was going by the fact your location says Ottawa/Ontario

179217,ch312,2008-03-31 02:33:00,1590," im aware of this, but the problem is some of them become a little too obsessed with musky and bash others who are 100% legal with their belittling comments.  if i were to start a thread with pics of me filleting a musky it would likely get locked as a result of all the musky worshipers who would complain to admins. it just strikes a nerve when people complain about others who are following the regs..."
179222,muskymike,2008-03-31 02:44:00,772," Following the regs is fine, so is ""becoming a little too obsessed"". To each his own. If its legal its legal. You are right though. If you posted I would be very unhappy as would a lot. Become a Musky guy and you will see why. Everyone fishes hard for that fish of a lifetime, and thats what EVERY Musky's guys goal is. In order to achieve that, catch and release is a great practice and should be practiced.  Bottom line is, if its legal then its fair. But keeping or killing a Musky in that manner, its going to bring some heat. There are far far far more catch and release guys then there are keepers.  Just my thoughts."
