178599,Rich,2008-03-29 22:28:00,3927,"In the last week, we've travelled far and wide in search of open water fishing. First stop was Brantford's industrial section for polluted carp and bluegills. lol  Sugarpacket nailed the first carp at this spot and Splenda & Grandma checked it out.    After this, the fish seemed to stop biting. So we got in the truck to get going and ""click"" is the only sound the engine would make. Not a dead battery as we tried to boost it. So we had to wait for a tow truck to show up for a while, I said ""Might as well keep fishing then"".. and lo and behold, I actually caught a few. Then the bluegills moved in and we had fun with them for a while.      And 2 days ago, we tried locally for carp but all of our spots were way too high and fast moving to fish properly. The fish were just not around either. Splenda tried his beginner's luck for a while and had a blast, but he couldn't rise a bite either.   ""Look, I'm doing it""   ""Oh, oh, got a bite""   ""Meh!""  And finally, we headed out today to find that the water levels had dropped. Fish were still moving slow but we did locate a few carp. A few lost ones and just this little one landed. The spot was a tricky spot for landing them. They hit canned corn drifted, no sinker.    All in all a great week with the fishin' family."

Love the pictures of him with the fishing rod and that smile, he will melt the girls hearts as he gets older!  Shame that the truck wouldn't start for you but it looks like the family had a great time and that is what those days are all about!   Thanks for sharing a little of your life Rich and Sugarpacket!"
