178241,tdotfisherman,2008-03-28 23:23:00,317,"This thread was inspired by reading another thread, and the angler who’s obviously a little distraught about not being able to catch any Northern Pike in the GTA, lol!  Anyway, I figured this would be a fun little thread to generate some interesting discussion… How long is your longest skunked streak? When did it take place? And why did you figure it took place?  Personally, I’d say my longest skunked streak has probably been 5 fishing outings, and about 25-30 hours straight of not catching any fish. It happened when fishing around the shores of Toronto, and took place this past November…  Alright, enough about me… lets bring on the comments!"
178248,Gerritt,2008-03-28 23:39:00,6129,"I think Wayne has this title locked up.... ""there are no fish in Simcoe""  Myself... I have been out for a week... caught 4 fish... trip cost me 1000.00.... those were EXPENSIVE fish!   G"
178249,huntervasili,2008-03-28 23:41:00,1604,"Lol, I wont answer that question but I will tell you It was longer than both of you with worse results  Plus if I told you you would wonder if I could fish lol"
178250,irishfield,2008-03-28 23:43:00,26272,"$250,000 a fish G... man you know how to go at it !  And as for Simcoe.... didn't want you to go home empty handed so I gifted mine to you... AGAIN !"
178251,kemper,2008-03-28 23:44:00,2232,"The first fall/winter season I started steelheading.  Probably 10 or more outings before I started hooking fish  consistantly, but so far in 2008 Ive only hit one skunk. *knocks on wood"
178304,bassmaster4,2008-03-29 01:38:00,801,my longest skunk streak was almost a whole summer it was my first year fishing and all i wanted was to get into a pike on the third last outing of the summer i caught a pike and a catfish and i was happy as can be. Last season my longest skunk streak was 3 outings i believe
178305,charlied,2008-03-29 01:40:00,584,when I first started to learn to bottom bounce for steelies in the niagara....I went 4 weeks and 4 days.  Went fishing everyday for at least a minimum of 6 hours a day.  But I will tell you I will never forget my forst steelie!
178309,Greencoachdog,2008-03-29 01:45:00,8163,I think MTP holds the all time record...
178311,ccmtcanada,2008-03-29 01:48:00,7971,"Hmm....when bly and I go for our fall walleye, we get skunked probably 4 out of 5 times we head out....but the payoff on days we hit fish is worth all that work!  When I started targeting steelhead last winter, I went my first 6 times without a hook up....the next time I had a hookup but lost it....and it took CANADIANCOPPER to get me into my first few steelies."
178314,Dondorfish,2008-03-29 01:53:00,1000,I'll let ya know when it ends!!!   LOL   Don

178359,wuchikubo,2008-03-29 09:44:00,1114,"If classified by lake, the bog has me beat for 3 years straight on the ice (about 6 outings and 0 fish). Even got skunked with a few guys that said they knew where the fish were."
178369,bowshep,2008-03-29 11:55:00,378,"l can Never have the things l want.... been skunked sooooo much and my friends  around me tells me to get over it... but l cant.... l want some things so bad... l guess l have to work harder... because l just dont give up ... skunk streak...54, 56 outtings and l am now at 37 outings for this round.  Ken"
178394,Beans,2008-03-29 13:36:00,3339,About 4 seasons back I went 0 for 8 icefishing trips before finally getting into some perch...this year I'm 1 dinky perch for 3 trips...  Don't get around much any more...
178401,Hookset,2008-03-29 14:19:00,367,"Been a Leafs fan since 1967...talk about the World's Worse Skunk !!!!  Beat that !!!  Other than that, fishing a Bass Tourney on Sparrow Lake and never touched a Bass, even during pre-fishing. My partner caught 3 including big fish of the Tourney and I can't add a damn thing to help out. We probably could have placed top 5 easy if dumbass here had just hooked one...but no...it still bugs me.   Hookset."
178415,shane,2008-03-29 14:44:00,652,"My steel-head skunk is pretty bad.   After almost twenty years and  more than a hundred trips.....I've caught two fish.  One was a little dink about 12"",  and the last one was a half dead, spawned out male that came out of the shadow and grabbed my yarn fly almost right at my feet, gave a quick splash, and then rolled over and I dragged him in.  My best steel-head day was on the Saugeen.  I had two fish on and lost them both, but one was a real beauty. Probably over ten pounds, screaming up and down the river and jumping like crazy for at least five minutes... and then it was off.  Pretty exciting for me. I don't really mind losing the fish so much because I would have released it anyway, but it would be nice to actually land one....."
178435,cranks bait,2008-03-29 15:50:00,721,"I've never been skunked.    I have been out on days where I let line out and rinse lures however.  Those are days that I am just out enjoying the day on the water.  I try not to remember those days, as I have had a few four in a row maybe.  I also remember coming home muttering a few words as to how it was a waste of gas to go out.  I just try and remember that everyday I get out is a good one."
178668,shane,2008-03-30 00:18:00,652,"I'm with you on this one Cranks bait.  There's lots of days when I don't catch anything, but I don't consider them to be wasted days.  And now that I've taken up fly-fishing, there's a lot more fishless days."
178672,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-30 00:22:00,2585,one full days outing 8 hours didnt catch a fish.  But i have been pretty lucky and have always got into a few even if they were smaller. I will admit that the last 8 or 9 years i have been fishing nipissing which makes it easy to catch a fish.  they have everything in that lake.  Cheers!
178819,OhioFisherman,2008-03-30 12:13:00,6623,"I have pulled some zippers, first time at Lake Chautaqua in New York, 4 days of fishing 2 practice days 2 tournament days and didn`t land a bass, 2 muskies on and lost them both just to keep the string going.  Next time there not a bit better, did cut the practice days, didn`t make sense to fish where they weren`t and I couldn`t locate them. 3rd time there like 5th or 6th place, dang fish must have found me.  I have shot blanks even on waters I knew well, but usually one day at a time, I hate patterns like that!  It can happen to anyone, fished in tournaments that no one caught a fish, 150 boats fields where 10 boats had fish, still beats sitting home!"
