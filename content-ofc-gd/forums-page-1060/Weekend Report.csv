Lots of people out.   From West to East   Beauty Water, Gin Clear    No Chrome Here Either    Meet Some Fellow OFC'rs - Why were they all standing in the field?    They were too far away to identify, but I thought I saw Cliff and Gerrit.  This creek had some steel in it but they were really spooky, I am going to tie some pink wire wrapped nypmth's this week and try them under a float the next time I have these conditions.  I had some black one's with me, but no interest.    Sunday, Headed up to Owen Sound.  We stopped by the Notta, bu we had no illusions about fishing it as it was all but blown out.  Thanks for the heads up guys.    The funniest Stop sign I have ever seen.  All that I can say is that you have some serious ungulates in the Grey Bruce area      The water was low on the tribes and very clear.  The bay trib mouths were full of ice and man was it windy.        Cheacking out my new waders and jacket (Old waders had a slow leak above the knee, did not feel like turning into and iced drink.    Beauty shot taken by my wife      Nice weekend.  No chrome, and for the record, 2 days + no fish, I think this is the longest skunk period.  I will need to correct that this weekend.  Michael and Michelle"
