Problem...when they start to loose interst (as they got older) it hurt and it puzzled me big time... It was truly painful.....Funny thing tho..... Seems once they got over the teenage years....they just sorta came back to it. Well, ..some it took til the age of 23 or so. Anyhoo Bud........looked like a great day our with Dad and the lads...WTG Take care and Dang man.........we'll speak soon. Looking forward to it. pete"
179020,mukluk,2008-03-30 20:56:00,196,"The picture of the young lad with the perch reminded me of the times Dad would take my brother and me perch fishing off Viginia beach. We had an old hut and could see them bite as the water was only 8ft. deep. That was 52 years ago and I'm still ""hooked on Lake Simcoe fishing today! Hope the same thing happens to your boys."
