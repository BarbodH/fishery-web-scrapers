179664,Mike the Pike,2008-04-01 01:00:00,3421,"Well folks if I ever finish digging out my big tinny from all that dam snow we got I will hopefully send it off to the dealer to pick up my new ride.  Question is what card should I purchase?I really do not know much about my new electronics.  My last unit was a simple Lowrance X-51.  My new unit will be a Lowrance LMS-525C dumb ass, GPS Combo  The areas I would like to cover is the great lakes,Bay of Quinte,St.Lawrence River,Ottawa River, Eastern Quebec and Boudreau Pond  I am really new to all of this so I need advise and recommendations on a good all around Card.  I spoke to Roy recently who said the card I may be looking for is #91 which I can not find on the Lowrance website.  My dealer wanted to give me a card that mostly covers Northern Quebec which I rarely drive to.  Help!!!!!!!!  Mike"
179665,irishfield,2008-04-01 01:02:00,26272,"Navionics Gold + ..Great Lakes and Maritimes should cover it all.  SD-14XG  This card provides detailed coverage of the entire Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie & Ontario), St Lawrence and the Canadian Maritimes, including Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake, Lake Champlain, Trent Severn Waterway, Ottawa River, Rideau Waterway and the Finger Lakes."

179671,Roy,2008-04-01 01:08:00,13728,"Actually Mike, I said  901  but the one you need/want is the gold chart #14. It covers Entire Great Lakes, St Lawrence and the Canadian Maritimes, including Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake, Lake Champlain, Trent Severn Waterway, Ottawa River, Rideau Waterway and the Finger Lakes."
