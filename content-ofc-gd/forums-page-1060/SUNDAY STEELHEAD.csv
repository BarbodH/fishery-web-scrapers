179033,jdmls,2008-03-30 21:18:00,575,"Got out to the local river by about 8:00AM today.... water was in good condition...still -5 , so we battled the cold wind and slushy waters until about 11:00 , when things started to warm up. Managed a few fish within the crowds of guys out there....Crowds are to be expected now so I am not going to wine about it...Like others said posts like this don't help in reducing them but whatever, I have learned to face the music by know on weekends !!!  Any how I went 4 for 6 and my buddy did about the same, All fish on white and peach roe bags. Ran out of pinkies but from what i had seen others were doing well with them all day.. Here's some highlights. It was too cold to pull out the camera everytime we got a fish on so I only snapped a few....I am not going to bother smudging out the backround on the couple of pics.  3/4's of Toronto steelheaders were out there today, so like Kemper said.... it aint news that the fish are in at this stream. Enjoy.....  Oh ya , good running into you down there, DMASSE and your buddy(not sure if you are on the board)..See you guys out there again sometime    nice action shot of my buddy I thought turned out good    LOL @ my buddy as he looses this nice female at the bank trying to take a pic...I have it all on video to agonize him with all summer !!

179252,jdmls,2008-03-31 03:38:00,575," Ya was surprised. I was expecting mud, but I guess the cold temps shut down the run off....first thing was about 12"" visability then it got a bit too clear for my likings by the afternoon, and the spook kicked in....That's when we decided to go waste some money at Gagnon's !!!"
