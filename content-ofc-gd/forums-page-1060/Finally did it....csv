178807,Casey123,2008-03-30 11:35:00,461, Aren't they endangered?     They should have just targeted personal watercraft owners but there would have been a huge backlash from owners and manufacturers alike.
178813,kickingfrog,2008-03-30 11:58:00,8333,"As someone who still hasn't taken the test for some of the same reasons mentioned above, I have a question; Does the test cover any aspects of trailering?"
178816,Gerritt,2008-03-30 12:04:00,6129,no it does not. Basic water safety and rules (bouy meanings etc)  G
178824,kickingfrog,2008-03-30 12:23:00,8333,"Perfect. I know how to handle a boat and have taken navigation courses (long before the Op card though). I don't have much trailering experience. I'll get my card and be at the launch just when everybody else is trying to use it. Don't worry you'll know it's me. I'll have the keys locked in the truck and the boat on the trailer, but the trailer will not be connected to the truck. Wave, say hello, and be thankful that I'm a safe boat operator."
178887,irishfield,2008-03-30 14:49:00,26272, It doesn't cover anything about how to drive a boat for that matter !
178891,Gerritt,2008-03-30 14:58:00,6129,  You are correct Wayne... Hence one of the major reasons I see it as a cash grab.  G
178907,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-30 15:49:00,835,"Kickingfrog...if you took those courses with cps they will give you a card if you rejoin.  The problem with an on water course and test is how do you do it cheap and not involve a gov. agency because they don't want anything to do with it. An on water test through coast guard or trans ca would compare with getting a motorcycle license and whats that cost around $500? You think $30 is a cash grab.  They didn't go after pwc because the #2 killer is the small tinners that a lot of us use, #1 is canoes.  The big problem with the boat test is it draws people away from a decent boating course. Guessing your way through a test doesn't help much on the water. I know some who have never been in a boat that passed the test.    It is possible that the whole thing may collapse yet due to noncompliance."
178933,JayZ,2008-03-30 17:20:00,18,"  target the idiots that are the problem is correct.  i know this is a fishing board, and although i have been fishing my entire life, i also own and enjoy pwc.  not every pwc owner travels at 100km/hr riding in the wakes of boats.  try not to paint all pwc riders with such a wide brush....  i have several friends who own pwc.  we all obey the rules of the water.  do we like to jump waves and have fun?  of coarse we do.  are there idiots who break the rules and ruin the reputation of pwc for the rest of us?  of coarse there are.  in my years of fishing, i have never had a pwc buzz by my boat.  they generally stay pretty far away.  i'm sorry to say that i cannot say the same for fishermen.  i can't count the number of bass boats and other idiots that cruise by at full throttle within casting distance of our boat.  it is this type of fisherman that thinks they own the water and can do as they please.  the water is for everyone to enjoy.  fisherman and pwc alike.  so please target the idiots, whoever they might be."
179035,Bitsmith2k,2008-03-30 21:19:00,396, hmm.. i'd have to call shenanigans on that.. i did the test this past thurs. at my office.. and i have booze in my desk  i agree that its a cash grab as well..
179074,Greencoachdog,2008-03-30 22:27:00,8163,"Our vessel operators license has been mandatory since '98 here, it is designated on our drivers license with a class:V (for vessel).  I don't think it's a cash grab at all, they do it to educate!... if you had to study for the test or missed any of the questions... you didn't know as much as you thought you did!!!  Our test consists of 60 questions and a passing grade is 80%... I did have to study for it and I did learn a few things.  It is not a bad thing!"
179075,Gerritt,2008-03-30 22:31:00,6129,"Dawg... did your test actually teach you about boat operation??   ours does not!  Just basic safety junk and what certain bouy's mean... that is it... anyone with a brain could breeze through this test..  I have a good idea where I messed up... what sustained wind speed in knots is considered ""Strong"" and the proper way to  put on a life jacket while in the water... I had the correct answers just in the wrong order...  If your test acually teaches folks HOW to operate a vessel.. it would be well worth the $$  Here... it is nothing more then 99.9% of people already know if they use common sense.  G"
179080,Greencoachdog,2008-03-30 22:38:00,8163,"Did your drivers license exam actually teach you about operating a car?... mine didn't, sure I had to take the driving test the first time to see if I knew how to operate a vehicle... but they didn't teach me! It's the same thing Gerritt, mainly to educate you about the laws!"
179087,Gerritt,2008-03-30 22:42:00,6129,I went through drivers ed.... but you do bring up a valid point...  However that said.. the operators guides makes it so pretty much any tom dick and harry can drive a car...  I wish the boat exam was as through...  G
178746,muskymike,2008-03-30 03:21:00,772,"I agree with the testing to a certain degree.  When I was 14 I was swimming about 50' from shore. I was standing on a shoal in about 5 1/2' of water, my head and the tops of my shoulders were out of the water. A boat came around and circled in front of the provincial park where I was swimming. I noticed his course and started to move in towards shore. Well low and behold he turned and headed right for me. He was watching the beach behind him and wasnt looking forward at all. It was a 16' fibreglass trihaul with a 60 johnson on the back. I didnt have time to get out of his path as where he turned was very close to where i was. When he was on top of me I pushed off as hard as i could basically just smacking the underside of the bow. My upper body pushed off to the side and my legs kicked up. His skag took a chunk of my shin (just the skin) and nicked my shin bone. I had a hole in my leg about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide. my bone was completely exposed. I had to swim back to shore and walk to a campsite with blood pouring from my leg. I am ever greatful to the couple that helped me, kept me calm and called for help. Supposedly I was in shock but I can recall the whole event from start to leaving Parry Sound hospital that night.  Point of my story is, it was a 13 year old with a 12 year old in the boat and they LEFT. They didnt stop to see if I was alright, even though my sister was screaming and people at the beach saw it happen. They left cus they were scared.  I am so lucky I did not loose my leg and no major damage was done. Just a lot of stitches and a lot of pain. It was really scary.  I hope that ALL young kids/teenagers do learn something from this course. Not as much for adults even though there are a lot of irresponsible ones out there, I hope something like my situation that has happened doesnt have to happen to anyone else. It was such a scary day.  Sorry this is so long, but its hard to explain without all the details."
178751,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-30 03:29:00,835,"AS of Jan 7 2008  REGARDLESS OF THE TEST FORMAT, NO TEST CAN BE ADMINISTERED IN THE CANDIDATEâ€™S PRIVATE RESIDENCE.  The test site must be owned, leased, occupies, or otherwise controlled by the course provider but that is in no way under the control of a candidate taking a test.  There must be no consumption of alcoholic beverages at the test site.  All candidates must verify that they have not written a test within the last 24 hours.  There is some stuff on ID's and a whole bunch of other stuff but you get the picture."
178759,muskymike,2008-03-30 03:37:00,772,What about writing online then?
178760,Bly,2008-03-30 03:37:00,1556,"Cash grab or not, you passed. Congratulations to you Gerritt"
178765,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-30 03:49:00,835,"As far as we could figure it out , to write the test on a computer you must be in a classroom or where the test provider has control.  Writing at home googling the answer in another window under the supervision of a goldfish is over.  I'm not saying everybody cheated the online test but a lot did."
178769,muskymike,2008-03-30 03:55:00,772,"To my knowledge, you can write the test from home. The Supervisor must be a ""Professional"" though (doctor, engineer etc...) and you can do whatever it takes to pass it.  Have not heard different and the guys from Boatexam.com said the same.....odd, I wonder now  I took it in a group of about 20 friends in my buddies backyard. it was a breeze. I did the same for my FAC."
178774,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-30 04:56:00,835,"Transport Ca. test protocols as of Jan forbid testing in the home of the writer.  IT looks like trans ca. isn't enforcing the new rules any better than they did the old rules, writing online has been questionable from the start. Or maybe they're telling us one thing and others something else.   I used to test anywhere too, some of the new protocols are going to be tough, like isolating a test area at a trade show so that the writer can see no other activity other than out a window."
178791,Woodsman,2008-03-30 09:57:00,1286,"I wrote & passed mine at the London Boating, Outdoors & Leisure Show about a month ago. I got 49 out of 50. I paid $30 at the CPS testing booth. There was also two booths offering write till you pass or free there. One was charging $50. I was told the extra 14 questions were so the card would also meet US standards & requirements. Study the ""Safe Boating Guide"" before writing the test and you should have no problems.  Best Wishes: Rick"
178799,Roy,2008-03-30 10:57:00,13728,"Whether it's a cash grab or not, anyone who actually fails that test should not be allowed out of their house without supervision. That might be a little harsh but it's how I feel. Sorry."
178804,Gerritt,2008-03-30 11:19:00,6129,"I paid $35.00.... www.theoperatorcard.ca  and Here is how it worked...  I register, and choose someone to administer the test to me (it can be a person of your own choosing). You have to supply an email address for the person administering the test.  The then receive an email containing a link, in which they have to fill out a questionnaire.  After which they are emailed the test. the work sheet, and the rules.  You take the test, The administrator transfers your answers onto the work sheet.  The administrator then enters in your answers via a link contained in the email he received.  You have your score then and there.  A pass is 27 out of 36 (Too low in my opinion)     You are able to choose the venue in which you take the test... so long as it is not in your own home...  That said it could be very easy to buck the system by simplly using a Hotmail account.. However I did it the Honest way,   I hope this clears up any confusion.  G"
