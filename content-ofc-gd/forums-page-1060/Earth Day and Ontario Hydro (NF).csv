178854,bucktail,2008-03-30 13:19:00,1857,All of the public facilities in Halton have participated in Erath day shutdown yesterday. I get daily power reports emailed to me. They show me the hourly rate we get charged and how many kwh we have used. Since the rate is determined by demand I will be VERY interested to see if Ontario Hydro rate dropped between 8 and 9pm last night. If not I will be forwarding these charts to the media. I would hate to see peoples efforts reduced to an increase in profit.   Darren   Sorry for the heady topic so early....... we alll need spring to come!!!
