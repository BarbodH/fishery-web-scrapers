Another board member will donate his extra pair of size 11 boot waders to me, because, well, they're extra.  So this is what I gotta do.  I need to give my too small waders away.  They have never been wet, and always hung by the boots in storage.  Send me a pm, pick em up, and they're yours.  Since they're free, they will go to the first at the door.    I hate giving things away for free, but I don't have any choice here.  I also turned out my lights tonight, I feel so dirty."

178763,douG,2008-03-30 03:47:00,2693,"I hope you don't think that I would ever post a pic of the best trib ever. Of all time.  That's why it sorta looks like a fake background there, photoshopped in the Margaree.  Mum's the word."
178868,douG,2008-03-30 13:50:00,2693,"A couple have expressed some interest, I will post again how it works out."
179117,douG,2008-03-30 23:28:00,2693,"The waders are gone, thanks to those who expressed interest.  This is the way this happened.  I was talking to a board member who offered a spare set of waders.  I thought that I should pay this forward, and offered my waders here.  Dude that picked them up offered a tax receipt for MS.  I splained this to the younger daughter, and she said,""This is craaaaazy!  When does the madness stop?""  Pay it all forward, friends."
