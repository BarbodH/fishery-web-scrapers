178704,Casey123,2008-03-30 01:49:00,461,Was going to head up to the Nottawasga River tomorrow (catch and realese section)  Wondering if anyone has fished it in the last 2 weeks?  If so how was it? Also looking for water conditions if possible...   Thanks in advance  Michael and Michelle
178753,Scott S,2008-03-30 03:30:00,203,Hey Guys Havent been fishing the Notty yet. It's just starting to clear up. If we don't get any rain in the next couple of day's it should be fishable! Scooter
178800,tinbanger,2008-03-30 10:59:00,1028,"Tried on good friday . about 6"" visibility but wayyyy to much ice solid and moving. Going to try again today a bit farther north .  Keep an eye out for us ,one guy looks like he knows what he doing and me !  Red Honda van  TB"
178826,kickingfrog,2008-03-30 12:27:00,8333,Have I been reading the regs wrong? I'm not familiar with a catch and release section on the Notty?
178829,fish_finder,2008-03-30 12:46:00,370,"Hey Kickingfrog,  There is a section from one trib to another that is now (as of 2008 regs) catch and release only.  Just look under the exceptions and extended season sections to find the info you need!!"
178846,Casey123,2008-03-30 13:07:00,461,"Without getting into the fine tuning of the regs, basically from Alliston to Angus is C and R only. (Boyne to I believe the Pine)  Walking out the door right now."
178906,fish_finder,2008-03-30 15:48:00,370,you got it 4reel!
178916,kickingfrog,2008-03-30 16:30:00,8333,"So it's C&R in the section of the river that the township of Essa thinks it can charge the public to access/fish public water?  I'm all for C&R areas or seasons, providing it's based on science. I haven't and won't fish the Essa township section since the tax came in, so I guess I didn't notice the change in the new regs. I'll be sure to pass the info along."
178925,Scott S,2008-03-30 17:04:00,203,"Hey Kickingfrog; The Notty is all natural reproduction. There is no hatchery or stocking programs, so having a catch and release section isn't that bad of a idea. From what I understand it is just for rainbows, everything else is the same. I'm not real fond of paying to fish that part of the river myself! Scooter"
