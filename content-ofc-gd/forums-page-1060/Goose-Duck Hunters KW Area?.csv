178857,Pguzik,2008-03-30 13:20:00,34,Hows it going guys and gals ........ I am new to the area and am looking to get together with some goose/duck hunters in KW. I have a working lab and have only hunted birds for about 2 years. I have not been able to find a good website for bird hunters like here @ OFC. If anyone knows of a similar web site please let me know. Thanks all    email [emailÂ protected]
