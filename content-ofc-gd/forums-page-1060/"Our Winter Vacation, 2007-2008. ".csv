178586,Garry2Rs,2008-03-29 22:05:00,1425,"In seven days Buck and I will close the Arizona place, and begin our trek back to snowy Ontario. We will try to bring the warm weather with us, but from the photos I've seen this week, it might be May before I find the front stairs!!!  Looking back, this Winter was quite an adventure. Things started with a ""Bang"" when we wrecked the Skeeter on the highway outside of Flagstaff AZ. while driving down. I hope that the ""adventures"" finished with the breaking and replacing of the rusty axle on the Ranger trailer last month. In between we did some fishing, took a few pictures and drank a lot of cheap beer. Here in no particular order are some of the things we saw and did on; ""Our Winter Vacation, 2007/2008. ""  Crushed corner of Skeeter,  Broken axle on Ranger...  This should be straight across...   This is how it looks now...         PLACES WE FISH... Mittry Lake                  Fortuna Pond       Colorado River   Martinez Lake / Colorado River     Ferguson Lake / Colorado River    Fisher's Landing / Colorado River       Buck and Some Fish We Have Met.                                    It's nice to Winter down here in the desert...  BUT, we are looking forward to getting home to the Kawarthas  Garry2R's"
178588,Greencoachdog,2008-03-29 22:10:00,8163,Great report and pics Garry!!!  Looks like the fish started growin towards the end of the trip eh?
178592,silveradosheriff,2008-03-29 22:14:00,1025,Looks like you had a great vacation!
178593,Radnine,2008-03-29 22:17:00,1538,Great pictures Garry! Thanks for sharing. I have just booked a cottage on Cameron Lake in July. Maybe I'll bump in to you somewhere in the Kawarthas. Jim
178617,Garry2Rs,2008-03-29 22:53:00,1425,"Buck and I are always glad to see people who fish...grin. Unfortunately, Caleron Lake is shown as Figure ""E"" on this map...  We are way up where it says ""P"" That doesn't mean that something couldn't be arranged, just that it won't happen by accident. Garry2rs"
178618,kickingfrog,2008-03-29 22:54:00,8333,"It seams like yesterday you were heading down for the winter. Welcome back, we've kept some ice around to remind you why you left. Safe drive."
178629,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-29 23:13:00,2585,tough luck wiht the boat but great winter trip none the less.  Cheers!
178681,Garry2Rs,2008-03-30 00:38:00,1425,"All's well, that ends well. We should be in Apsley around the 13th, after visiting with the kids for a few days on the way home."
178684,mikeh,2008-03-30 00:44:00,824,"that last picture is nice,looks like lower buckhorn heading out to the lake."
178717,mattyk,2008-03-30 02:18:00,2110,some great pictures!
178724,2 tone z71,2008-03-30 02:41:00,1311,"Nice thanks for sharing ,looks like your golden is enjoying itself  in alot of those pics NICE"
178750,tbayboy,2008-03-30 03:29:00,1497,Yeah that certainly looks like a better way to spend the winter than my choice of holing up in the basement and praying for the snow to stop.  Hopefully the skeeter survives the trip back up with less excitement then the way down.
178777,Ramble,2008-03-30 05:37:00,713,"Looks like another good season in the south.  Unless we get a quick thaw here, you might wanna stop and pick up a pair of snow shoes before you get home lol  -Dave"
178782,Garry2Rs,2008-03-30 07:24:00,1425,"MikeH... You're right, that was heading out from the launch at Sunrise, in the village of Buckhorn, traveling east into Lower Buckhorn Lake. T Bay... The Skeeter went to that big Bass lake in the sky.  We now have an 18ft Ranger to play with. 2 Tone... Yes!  Buck like everything about boats, fish and water. Ramble & Kicking Frog... I have been in contact with the Elders at Curve Lake Reservation on Chemong Lake...The rain dance will be going on for the next week, to help melt the snow.  As a back-up plan, it has been Ninety degrees down here everyday for the last few weeks...I am trapping that heat under the tarp, to smuggle home.  Trust me...I guarantee the ice will be gone for the opening of Crappie on the fourth Saturday in April."
