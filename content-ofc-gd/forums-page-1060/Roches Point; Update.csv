The move comes after years of complaints of drunken rowdiness, illegal fishing, noise and drug abuse at the Roches Point public dock.  It prompted a couple who live next door to offer to buy the property for $650,000 and close it to the public, forcing council to declare the sale to be considered during a meeting that packed the council chambers.  The offer sparked the Roches Point Community Association to come forward with an alternate plan to manage the dock area with the hope of ending the chronic problems. The association members feared losing local use of the lakefront area â€”  a federal dock for more than a century before it was taken over by the town several years ago. Association president Murray Marriage said the proposed sale would also set a dangerous precedent leading to more potential private takeovers of public lakefront.  Council supported the proposal after hearing plans for the complete transformation of the property, including the continuation of its use by Georgina residents only, council.  A report from the town's leisure services department will outline details of the agreement."

LOL  Glad to see they reached a compromise, would be okay with the user fees if 100% of the funds went back into Lake Simcoe, the primary reason for access.  Not okay with user fees if the money goes into the Townships general revenues.  Would not mind seeing more user fees for other water ways such as: Big HEad, Grand (upper section), Boyne, Notta, etc., if all monies raised went back into water quality improvments and fishery improvments.  I think that most would agree we could use better enforcment, better mangment, better funding for local angling and conservation groups."
