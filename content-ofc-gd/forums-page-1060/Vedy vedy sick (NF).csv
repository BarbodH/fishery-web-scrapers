179021,Clampet,2008-03-30 20:58:00,1947,"Slowly starting to recover from the flu.  Apparently it is a real epidemic according to the local MD.  Missus had it since last Monday, I got it last Thursday.  Really took the wind outta my sails. Lost 9 lbs (benefit), and have to force myself to eat.  Next year I'll try the flu shot.  Anyone else afflicted?"

It's only in the 4th week that I've actually started to feel close to normal but I'm still tired early in the evening. At least the cough has subsided, and the aches. So don't give up hope. You will live to fight another day.  JF"
