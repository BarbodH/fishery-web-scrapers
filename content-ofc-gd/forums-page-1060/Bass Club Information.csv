178033,marcers75,2008-03-28 16:38:00,36,Can anyone recommend a Bass Club or if you are a part of one can you provide some info on it?  Thanks
178040,irishfield,2008-03-28 16:47:00,26272,Was some spammers around last year looking for members.  Do a member search for Sandyfig
178043,duber,2008-03-28 16:59:00,220,Were do you want to fish? There is a B.A.S.S. afiliated club on the BoQ called the Quinte Bassmasters.Although I am not a member I went to their last meeting and they seem like a real good bunch.Just do a google for them and you will find their website.
178048,Terry,2008-03-28 17:04:00,14456,here are a few links to get you started  http://wtbass.com/  http://www.mississaugabassmasters.com/aboutus.htm   http://www.bigfatbass.com/bu/index.shtml

178073,cranks bait,2008-03-28 17:28:00,721,I'm with Marcer on this question.  I searched for any info on a fish club/tournaments here in the Brockville area.  That is how I came upon this site.  I know they are out there I just cannot find any info for the local ones.
178097,marcers75,2008-03-28 18:05:00,36,"Thanks everyone,  I'll go check out the links your provided. Might also try Bass Pro, I know they have one and I only live 20 mins away."
178105,GBW,2008-03-28 18:28:00,8460,I know that www.cbaf.ca holds meetings at BPS the 1st Tuesday every month at 7:30 PM if you are interested.  The next is April 1st.
178121,pooch,2008-03-28 19:16:00,139,"Hey guys,  From what I can tell it looks like there are 2 main bass clubs organizations in Ontario, the BassMasters and the Canadian Bass Anglers Federation. There may be others, I just don't know of them. I don't think you can go wrong with either group. Look into their local ""chapters"" for a club closest to you, and go to a monthly meeting.  I joined the Kawartha Lakes Fishing Club (affiliated with the CBAF) last year, and I had a great time. We get together once a month in Lindsay to talk fishing and organize some club tournaments. Great group of guys, two of our members won the CSFL Bass Classic last year on Lake of Bays. For each club tournament we pair up a boater and non-boater to fish for the day. It's a great way to learn some new techniques, and see if you like tournament style bass fishing. Check out the www.cbaf.ca website and look for a club closest to you. I think all the clubs are looking for a few new members. I maintain the website for the Kawartha Lakes Fishing Club. We are presently in a unique situation where we have more boater's than non-boaters. If you are interested send me a PM, post a question on here, or check out our website at http://www.freewebs.com/kawarthalakesfishingclub/  Cheers, Andrew"
