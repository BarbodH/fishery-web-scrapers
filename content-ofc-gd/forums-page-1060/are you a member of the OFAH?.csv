177779,waterwolf,2008-03-28 02:45:00,556,"understand all of those concerns you've raised . i'm a little more naive [by choice ] on this issue.  my paid membership is doing something to better our opportunities to fish\hunt.  is 100% going to this cause ,, ofcourse not ,,,but some is . i donate funds and receive  more than just a great magazine but also the feeling i'm contributing to THE CAUSE .  i like having that sticker on the truck ,says ,ya ,  i give a ,,,,,hoot."
177786,danc,2008-03-28 02:55:00,4677,I've been getting the magazine without the membership for 30 odd years now. I'm happy with that. No plans for becoming a member anytime soon.
177789,aniceguy,2008-03-28 03:04:00,1094,"Dan C not only did OFAH kill the brook trout program up there they also had an instremental finger in Huron and GB  Years ago PAC committee up on GB and Huron all came to a concencus that a 1 fish with a slot was the appropriate course of action to ensure a sustainable fishery for rainbows....All the science, user groups OMNR staff etc agreed on this proposal  it was a done deal.  A  select few put such opposition on it( yes they were from OFAH ), that we now have a 2 fish limit which does nothing more then reduce exploitation by ohh 5% or nothing in the grand scale....I think I said it somewhere else the bonk and gut mentaility needs to change...sure its a great thing to enjoy a fresh meal of fish, personally nothing is better, but to take those fish from a supressed population, or one thats not capable of being sustainable in my opinion is an act of irrresponsibility as an angler, something OFAH still hasnt wrapped around yet....as for the glass house I have heard many a story on its construction some not very flattering but to go into the specifics without exact proof would be wrong to do."
177944,fishinggeek,2008-03-28 14:27:00,325," If they're nice enough to mail me, the least I can do is reciprocate!    Being a Canadian resident, I figure the best thing to do is to increase Canada Post's revenues (a government corporation) at the expense of the OFAH (a group I'm not in support of).  So transferring a very, very small amount of welfare away from OFAH towards public goods may benefit me in a very, very small way, which makes me feel ever so slightly better.  P.S.  Thanks for the informative read DanC.  I don't doubt it at all."
177951,RangerGuy,2008-03-28 14:36:00,564,I'm sure OFAH makes bad decisions sometimes.. While I'm not a brookie fisherman I'D LOVE TO .. go up your way DanC to experience this awesome fish one day. It sucks that one of the bad decisions was in your area  That would bug me as well.   The whole point of an organisation like this is that it's governed by its members. Problem is people don't want to put an effort in. They pay their membership fees and figure that's it. The said organization will just stand up for what I believe. I'm not exempt from this either.  After awhile the org gets so large it just does it's own thing gets choked down in red tape & politics etc. It's up to the member body to support the good descisions of the organisation the best they can and fight the poor ones not allowing the people on top to make desicions supported by the member body!  The voice of the OFAH should be nothing more than a messanger for the voice of the members. If they are allowed to make descisions on their own. Who's fault is it. THE MEMBERS! Myself included!
177973,Cory,2008-03-28 15:02:00,170,"I joined P3TA just to get those funny stickers they had ""fishing hurts"" (those ones are on my muskie box) and ""fish are our friends not food"" (put that one on my deep fryer)  Then I found out I could have gotten them without joining just by using their website"
177975,RangerGuy,2008-03-28 15:06:00,564,HAHAHAHA! Very funny
177997,LeXXington,2008-03-28 15:46:00,1928,"  You can lump the MNR, Provincial & Federal goverments etc.  If as many people who ""pay"" memberships to the OFC started writting letters to their member of parliment and the goverment. The MNR would get all the funding needed.  Fact is most people pay and hope that they will do the right thing. If not they grab a soap box stand up and say if I were running that place"

178795,Guest skeeter99,2008-03-30 10:33:00,0,"there is a reason they only put 10% of the money into the projects  in canada the law is money collected ie. charity/group etc...  a muinimum of 10% must be put to the orginization or group to be classified as a non-profit orginization, hence no tax and other benefits   All charities run like this cancer society/heart and stroke/march of dimes/unicef you name it, this is how it is.  I actually know a couple that go out collecting everyday (for a non-profit orginization) full time 9 to 5 and lets say they collect $1000 they only remit 10% to the charity and the rest is theirs (this is how it is done) you are fooling yourself to think otherwise, I actually dont know how they can sleep at night basically IMO stealing money.  I do not know of a charity or non-profit orginazition in canada let alone the world that puts in 100% of the money or even 90% to cover other costs   some are better than others as much as 30%  this is why I do not give to any charity, I would rather help a individual and write them a cheque  and also one of my family members quit working at a very large charity in canada because she saw the money was not going to the things it was collected for"
178797,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-03-30 10:53:00,52, I agree on the recruiting part the only other site I have found that has an easy going flow of info is www.skunked.ca As for the rest of your message I could not dissagree more.
178830,aniceguy,2008-03-30 12:47:00,1094,"skeeter Credit River Anglers puts 100% of monies raised into the projects  full financials are avaliable on the internet your right thought not many not for profit groups that rasie ver a million plus do it, we are one of the exceptions but there are others make a wish also runs on a high cash to investment ratio  IMO if your donating thats one well worth looking at"
178873,pikehunter,2008-03-30 13:59:00,1659," We used to be business neighbours with one of the charities on your quoted list. The administrators drove Mercedes, the others also drove new cars. When they became sick of the office furniture they would toss it out in the trash and buy new, the old still very usable. In fact the computer I am using right now is on one of those desks they threw out, I have had it now for about 8 years.  Yes It certainly appears that charities are a racket when you look at the facts you have presented. I wonder what the donation givers your friends collected from would think if they knew the money was being pocketed? So you are saying then too that they keep 90%, turn in 10% and the charity pockets 90% of the 10% they turned over? WOW"
178876,mistyriver1,2008-03-30 14:12:00,600,"Well said Greg.  .   Cory that's classic   I've been a member for 3 years and got Corey (Mistyjr) a junior membership as well.  Are they perfect...no but it's better than nothing.  I also got a call about a week ago from a guy calling on their behalf who obviously didn't know much about their goings on.  Told him that since I'm gonna be out of a job in 6 months I probably can't contribute much more other than my membership fees.  After telling him a couple of times it finally sunk in I understand the need for funding but if they start on telephone soliciting, it will make me rethink renenwing my membership."
177735,danc,2008-03-28 01:26:00,4677,"I raised a negative point earlier in this thread about the OFAH. Let me explain. As most of you guys already know, I'm a Nipigon Brook Trout fanatic. There is no other place on the planet like it. Going back 15 or 20 years ago, or so, the Nipigon strain of Brook Trout was in trouble. There were no special regs on the books for these precious fish. The numbers of these one of a kind fish were dropping, and the sizes were getting smaller. Along came Brook Trout guru Rob Swainson. He was an MNR biologist that was transferred to Nipigon from southern Ontario. Rob did several studies and discovered many things wrong with the Nipigon Brook Trout fishery. Many of the problems were related to the regs. Obviously these fish needed extra protection. But there were other problems. OPG power dams often left the spawned eggs high and dry. So Rob came to a water flow agreement with OPG. The waters would be left high enough for the Brook Trout eggs to hatch and continue on with their legendary lives. Next came the catch and keep regs. Rob instituted an 18"" minimum catch and keep size for both the Nipigon River and Lake Nipigon. The idea behind this proposal was that fish that have grown to be 18"" would have spawned twice in their lifetime. So their precious genes would live on. Stream and lakeside surveys showed that many 18"" fish were being caught and kept. Legal, but an alarming trend. The thought of an 18"", 2 fish limit brought out lots of fishermen. Since all of the 10, 12, 14 and 16 inch fish were being released, suddenly there was plenty of 18"" fish to be caught. Another alarming trend. The big fish were back in Nipigon and the anglers came out to catch them. After a few years Rob decided to make the Nipigon a true trophy fishery. He'd upp'ed the ante to a minimum 22 inches in the Nipigon River, yet the 18 inch minimum remained the same on the lake. I found this rather strange. Keep in mind that a 22"" Nipigon Brook Trout is 5 years old and near the end of it's life. Why would the 18"" minimum be good for the river, but not for the lake? Made no sense to me. So I bumped into Rob in the field one day and as we were discussing the state of things, I asked him why there was a 22"" mimimum on the river, but not on the lake. His answer floored me. He told me that he pushed very hard for the 22"" on the lake as well, but it was blocked by the OFAH. Wow. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. What is the OFAH all about if they don't agree with what very well might be the most knowledgeable Brook Trout conservationist  on the planet??? Who makes their decisions for them? Are they made from board room in a a concrete and steel high rise in southern Ontario? What do they know about Nipigon Brook Trout management? Nothing, obviously. These are some pretty serious decisions made on their behalf. Did they make this decision because they like to visit Nipigon annually and they like to take a few fish home with them? There is really no other reason why they would oppose this. Absolutely no other reason that I can think of.  Anyways, jump ahead 10 years or so. The Minimum is 22"" on both the lake and the river as of a couple of years ago. I'm not sure how it came about. But if this is the kind of thinking that goes on with the OFAH, then I wish to not be a part of them. There's very few strictly Brook Trout fishermen on this message board. But how would you Muskie guys feel if the OFAH implemented a 2 fish, 30"" minimum next year? I know. That's just how I felt. It was a giant step backwards."
177738,danbouck,2008-03-28 01:35:00,4380,  You talk about money being put to better use and you make a comment like this!
177750,bramptonjerry,2008-03-28 01:55:00,132,"     I have not been able to find an organization that I was interested in joining that does not automatically force me to join the ofah...I have never seen any of this anti ofah propaganda, as a matter of fact quite the opposite, almost like their afraid of them....like the subject is taboo"
176665,Tootsie II,2008-03-26 13:15:00,162,"Like many of you I may disagree with some of their stands on issues but if you don't have a good strong organization representing hunting and fishing views, just watch how quick the ante's and P3TA's of the world will get their way with the politicians. It's the large urban areas that provide votes for them. Just ask any farmer how well their views are taken at Queens Park.  Running an organization such as that simply takes money in today's world and you try finding good people for little money. The salaries of may corporate CEO's make OFAH's look like peanuts and I'm sure there are no stock options at OFAH.  The future of our favourite pastime is in our hands and if we're not careful there are more than a few people out there who can be swayed by pictures of animals in traps or fish on hooks to donate their momey to anti causes.  I am a regular member of OFAH and do not sit on any of their boards or committees. It's like insurance, it's not perfect but at some point you may need it, another necessary ""evil"" of life."
176679,bramptonjerry,2008-03-26 13:40:00,132,I'm really not liking what I'm hearing here...I guess I'm not paranoid....it's really starting to bother me now that a couple of groups I'm considering joining automatically tie me in with them...I certainly realize that good people need good pay to be retained but their efforts in advertising and fundraising seem to be their top priority
176680,fishinggeek,2008-03-26 13:45:00,325,"No way will I be a member.  Why spend my hard-earned money on an organization that, by and large, does not represent my own personal interests?  I'd rather donate my money to a charity instead."
176682,Gerritt,2008-03-26 13:47:00,6129,I WAS a member until all the mailings began piling up.. then the phone calls... always the same thing MONEY MONEY MONEY.... I got fed up with them begging for donations and canceled...  Now if I could only get the Police Circus People to stop calling daily  G
176685,Mike01,2008-03-26 13:52:00,378,"Personally, I would never join. I find them to be a little over the top.  Sure its great to have an organization out there that is passionate about what they do, but when all they want is more money and they make you feel bad for being an angler if you don't give it to them.  I don't think thats right. But thats just my opinion."
176694,TJQ,2008-03-26 14:15:00,7806,"Well...  i have a thought... as far as I know, they are the only larger lobby group that represents the interests of Ontario hunters and anglers.  I don't agree with alot of the stuff they do, I do agree with alot of the stuff they do, I do find their emphasis on S. Ontario alot of the time.  HOWEVER - they are the only Ontario Based lobby group of any size so I support them.  If it weren't for them, i do believe the goivt would do whatever they want on the natural resource front, most likely not to my liking at all.  Alot like this board, its easy to criticize when your not on the other side and have to cater to your members, who always have differing opinions.  You cant please everyone all of the time, its near impossible to please anyone even a little of the time....  we all have differing opinions as to how the resource should be managed."
176696,CLofchik,2008-03-26 14:17:00,854,If it wasn't for the OFAH cobwebbing with Metro East Anglers there wouldn't be a single chinook salmon stocked in Lake Ontario west of Port Hope.  But the OFAH has also drunk the Atlantic salmon KoolAid.     I'm torn and confused whether I like them or not.
176734,Dano,2008-03-26 15:02:00,719,"I was a faithful member for many years too, but I do have a problem in that they cant seem to police the membership. Every single convicted local poacher that I know, which at this point stands at 6 individuals was a member of this organization. Somehow, I doubt that is a regional thing and I know it is nothing I want to be associated with."
176737,Fishnfiend,2008-03-26 15:05:00,357,"I am a member.  I am mostly because I get a 'free' subscription to Ontario Out of Doors and some insurance while I am hunting and fishing (or travelling to/from). I figure that any money that actually makes it into preserving fishing/hunting rights and or stocking, etc is worthwhile.  Even if it is a fraction of a dollar every year, I figure it is better than nothing and that as a large group we may actually stand a chance against those idiots at P3ta, etc."
176739,bramptonjerry,2008-03-26 15:07:00,132, I don't think that's got anything to do with the ofah
