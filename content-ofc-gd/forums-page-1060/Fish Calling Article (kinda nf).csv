Fish May Respond to Sound  By JAY LINDSAY Associated Press Writer AP Photo AP Photo/Steven Senne Buy AP Photo Reprints Your Questions Answered Ask AP: Passport Files, Picking Nominees  BOSTON (AP) -- Call them Pavlov's fish: Scientists are testing a plan to train fish to catch themselves by swimming into a net when they hear a tone that signals feeding time.  If it works, the system could eventually allow black sea bass to be released into the open ocean, where they would grow to market size, then swim into an underwater cage to be harvested when they hear the signal.  http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/P/PA...-03-26-11-04-23"

Bert couldnt catch a darn thing, meanwhile Ernie is sitting there yelling ""Here...fishy...fishy...fishy....fishy"", and they were jumping in the boat!!!  :lol::lol::lol::lol::lol:"
179469,HTHM,2008-03-31 19:24:00,4082, Funny I always thought they were quite happy go lucky characters......
179482,Hookset,2008-03-31 19:52:00,367,"  Hate to break it to you dude but...They were seen on ""Fishing with Shelley and Courtney"" Hiding in the bushes, Bert asked Ernie to give him a worm.  Courtney hasn't been the same since.   Hookset."
179487,Stoty,2008-03-31 20:03:00,2910,I would hate to think that I spent years watching 2 gay puppets.
179490,Hookset,2008-03-31 20:10:00,367, You seem well adjusted Stoty...all should be fine.  Sorry we hijacked the thread Snypa.  That topic you posted sure could change commercial fishing. Maybe for the better if proven. Very Cool.   Hookset.
179510,Snypa,2008-03-31 20:57:00,25,"Stoty, I think you will be fine  Hookset, no worries man, I actually got a good chuckle out of your replies, as for the article, yes I think it could really change the ways of the Off-Shore fishermen especially if it really catches on, I'm really liking the conservation side of it, but my thinking is, if they were to implement something like this on a large scale, wouldn't a lot of fishermen be out of work ?? like there wouldn't be a need for fishing trollers etc, since you can just call the fish in ?!?   I'll assume they can't do this with crab & lobster etc though."
