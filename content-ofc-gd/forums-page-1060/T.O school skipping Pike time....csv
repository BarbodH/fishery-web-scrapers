178744,snag,2008-03-30 03:19:00,1932,"Now you know all my secrets.  This burdons you with great responsibility.  That lure is magic and I was happy to pass it on to you (just remember our deal)  FYI - Those are 2 different pics, (I cropped them and blurred them to drive the purists/lurkers nuts).  Thanks for not letting go of my feet while I dangled over frigid, toxic water in a t-shirt to grab my/your pike on my lure in my fishing spot. LOL!!  Congrats,  S."
178811,brickNblock,2008-03-30 11:52:00,598,I'd say it was worth it. What a great photo......Says it all. That pic rates right up there with BPSBassman's(Rogers) SMILING musky shot.
