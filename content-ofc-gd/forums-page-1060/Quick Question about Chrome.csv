We fish it opening weekend and always have great sucess with lower then average pressure for the weekend. On the strech of the river, there is a beauty hole, 10 feet + in depth and very, very long.  Problem is, the steelies never stack up in the hole.  They always sit in the rifts and log jams up stream and down stream but I have never seen or caught a fish in the hole. The trib is a nice gravel bottom with gin clear water(my fav water condition to fish).  Thanks in advance  Michael"

179742,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 02:35:00,7971,What CC said....they need the high oxygen levels in the rifts for their eggs to survive from what I understand.

179768,bow slayer,2008-04-01 04:08:00,1074,check it late in the spring the dropbacks will use this after spawning.On the tribs I fish we catch dropbacks all the way into mid june always in deep pools.
