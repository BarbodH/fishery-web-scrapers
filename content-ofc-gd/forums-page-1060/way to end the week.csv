We all know this weather won't last for to long it is spring after all. This is the result. Went 1 for 2. The second brown followed my cleo right in to shore and when i stopped my retrieve she hit. I set the hook to soon and pulled it right out of her mouth. Well atleast both fish ended up back in the lake.  Man these fish are pretty. For whatever reason i cannot add the picture. Sorry all no fish porn today
