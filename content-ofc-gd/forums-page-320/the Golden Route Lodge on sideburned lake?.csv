643581,michigander fisherman,2011-11-28 03:15:00,64,looking for info on how the fishing is at the Golden Route Lodge
643824,chris.brock,2011-11-29 01:48:00,4053,"I fished Sideburned for 1 day and camped there for the night, I caught 0 walleye (I was targetting them) and 2 small pike, it seems like one of those weird Chapleau area lakes that are either hard to figure out or there's just not many fish in it, the lodge is pretty close to the noisy hiway  I do remember James Smedley (Ontario Out Of Doors) writing about Sideburned (fished with a local who knew some spots and techniques) and they did ok  I'd look into Bisco Lk or Rays Camp on Ramsey Lk instead of these lakes"
644227,ctdd2006,2011-11-30 04:26:00,531,"I had a lot of success there mid to late september this year.  Lots of walleye, pike and jumbos.  Stayed at Moosehorn though.  Not a bad lake....for us....that week.  Nothing huge but a couple mid 20's."
644686,michigander fisherman,2011-12-01 22:44:00,64,so i have a group of 12. would we be able to limit out on pike and walleye to take home to michigan in a week and be able to have enough for a fish fry while still at the lake

644718,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-01 23:59:00,0,haha... you have to pay big dollars to get into those kind of lakes.  they put gates up around them to make sure us locals can't fish them.
776049,bluewalleye,2013-03-28 13:00:00,2,"i am in a group of 10 that go to the golden route lodge.we have experienced really great fishing in the first 2 lakes there.we fish for walleye, northern pike and jumbo perch and its a rare day that you dont catch your limit in walleye and pike.we stayed in a cabin while we were there .It was not fancy but it had nice bathroom and kitchen and electric power.The price we thought was reasonable and owners were helpful.we will definitely be going back."
