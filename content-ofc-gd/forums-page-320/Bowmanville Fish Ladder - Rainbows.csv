776157,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-03-28 23:15:00,83,I was down to the creek today and got a few photos of rainbows challenging the fish ladder. If all goes according to plan this ladder will be replaced by a new fish way in time for the Salmon run.

776161,moxie,2013-03-28 23:25:00,1566,Great shots. Driven by instinct. Another example of natures perfection. Thanks for sharing.
776162,Locnar,2013-03-28 23:26:00,645,"Heh heh, the third picture looks like the fish is about to slam right in the wall."
776178,Twocoda,2013-03-29 00:15:00,4130,Good fun catching them on camera eh? nice shootin IFH....fish look pretty healthy
776184,Garnet,2013-03-29 00:53:00,2056,"They do hit the wall, jump up on the apron and flop around. It's a site.  They jump in and out of the fish ladder until the temp (just a little over 42f) is right and they will be gone in couple hrs."
