Would like to fish for pike, walleye or bass. Any recommendations on an anywhere we could drive to maximum if 5 hours from Newmarket area and then carch a flight? Thanks."
776311,solopaddler,2013-03-29 21:49:00,8605,I'm a big fan of Park's Fly In Fishing out of Chapleau. If you've seen any of the reports I've posted here on OFC over the years you'll know the fishing is great.  Cheapest prices in the industry bar none and roughly a 7 hour drive from Newmarket to Chapleau if you use the Sultan road shortcut. He doesn't advertise 3-4 day trips on his website but I know he'll do them.  Any questions shoot me a pm.  Cheers  http://www.outpostcamps.com/
776334,adempsey,2013-03-30 01:54:00,1498,Lake Country Airways (used to be Stanton Air?) out of Orillia is probably the closest one.  I think most of the lakes are bass lakes.  I don't know anything much about them though.

776441,irishfield,2013-03-30 19:21:00,26272,Could drive to Temagami and have Darren (Lakeland Airways) put you into one of his back lake camps.
776445,solopaddler,2013-03-30 19:29:00,8605,The problem is there are no truly good options within a 5 hour drive. You really need to drive a bit further to have a decent experience.  That's my personal opinion anyway.
776563,mattyk,2013-03-31 08:42:00,2110,Thanks mike and everybody for the comments. Parks looks pretty promising.
