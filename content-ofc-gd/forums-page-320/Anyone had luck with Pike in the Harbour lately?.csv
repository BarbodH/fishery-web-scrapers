775670,hotsky,2013-03-26 11:46:00,400,I tried the Harbour twice in the last week hoping to catch pike which I thought would be moving in ready to spawn but no luck. Anyone had different resaults? or they're not there yet?
775692,JoshS,2013-03-26 15:03:00,729,"It's a late spring, haven't noticed them move right in yet. They're still in late winter mode and deeper however they'll probably be moving in really soon now."
775702,fishing,2013-03-26 16:04:00,167,They are around.
775820,hotsky,2013-03-27 01:01:00,400,Well if they are they are getting better at avoiding my baits.
775822,Locnar,2013-03-27 01:08:00,645,I was wondering the same for the Whitby Harbour. Been down there probably 5 times in the last couple weeks... not even a hint of anything being in the water.
775823,fishing,2013-03-27 01:19:00,167,"As far as I know, at least 6 pike were caught the past weekend."
775933,ehg,2013-03-27 19:20:00,2666,Just a heads up that pike closes midnight Mar 31. and opens again 5 weeks or so later on Lake Ontario and harbour waters.
775965,Locnar,2013-03-27 22:09:00,645,Not my harbour... it falls under zone 17. Open all year.
775967,highdrifter,2013-03-27 22:22:00,2534,"Water temps are still a little cold for pike to be in the shallows, but they are inching their way in.  Look for drop offs and edges adjacent to entrances of the shallow bays that you know pike will congregate to when they're on the spawn.  Got one last night just as the sun was setting.  She came up from about 15-20ft of water.  cheers HD"
