775793,solopaddler,2013-03-26 23:08:00,8605,So your lead foot finally caught up with you eh Lou?  (Flashback to our drive back from Nakina LOL!)
775795,Garnet,2013-03-26 23:16:00,2056,"I didn't say it was smart, she was not paying.  Like me it's very unlikely I will be back in CT same with Green Bay Wisconson I got a launch ramp parking ticket for $8. Not display correctly. It was on sunvisor not the dash.  You guessed it, I didn't pay."
775796,BillM,2013-03-26 23:18:00,17367," Flashback is right, lol.    I'm not going to bust you for speeding, but sir.... you have an expired license, lol."
775819,solopaddler,2013-03-27 00:35:00,8605, And an expired sticker.  Triple whammy.
775825,icedude,2013-03-27 02:02:00,459, Our Plumber has it right---at least from my limited experience. Got pulled over in Virginia of all places--speeding--20 over--Three Years ago...Still feel the Coppers targeted my Ontario licence plates.  210 Bucks--Curb -Side U.S. Justice in Action  God Bless America--lol   Paul
775840,jayess,2013-03-27 03:01:00,187,"For what it's worth, I was pulled over in Washington going about 20 (miles) over while driving with US plates. Myself (Canadian), a Texan, and an Indian from Mumbai -- we were all interns at a tech company down there. Suspicious albeit innocent load of passengers.  Anyways, cop lowered the ticket, I paid the fine, never noticed a change to my insurance back in Ontario."
775854,Garnet,2013-03-27 11:11:00,2056,I got a speeding ticket 500 ft from the Ivy Lea border NY side. So the cop takes my info and tells me the ticket will be mailed to me.  Cost of speeding $75 cost of admistration $85.
775855,aniceguy,2013-03-27 11:42:00,1094,"ah flashback to Nakina is right....lol that was funny, until I got home and showed the wife  Mike I recal uou and I got one one in NY a few back, did it ever show on your insurance in any way? No question Im paying the ticket, its the recriprical agreement stuff thats Important.  I did contact a lawyer in Mercer county, anf for 25 he is going to call me Monday. If they do report to Ontario im going for a trip to Mercer.......Speaking of the internet, there is not a single yes answer to this."
775857,aplumma,2013-03-27 12:03:00,6896, We didn't know you were paying $25.00 for the answer.lol... For $50.00 I will say yes and sound like I mean it.   Cheers  Art
775860,aniceguy,2013-03-27 12:20:00,1094,"its different there in good ole mercer county.  they don thave trafic agents like here, I have to engange a lawyer to simply ask this question."
775891,DanD,2013-03-27 14:51:00,2223,I got hit with a ticket in New York State; the trooper told me that they had an agreement with Ontario that the MTO would not issue a replacement license plate sticker until it was paid.  Dan.
776024,pikehunter,2013-03-28 09:09:00,1659,"I believe that there are far more states that share info with Ontario than what has been mentioned here. Pay the ticket and suffer. Why have skeletons in your closet?  I got one years ago on the Florida Turnpike back when the limit was 55. He clocked me doing 85 mph. Even back then it was a hefty ticket, however the cop looked at me and says, ""You are going to pay this right?"" I said yes, He knocked it down to 20 bucks and told me to enjoy my last couple of days in Florida. I went to the county courthouse the next morning and paid the ticket. He was a good ambasador for the state, in my opinion. Surprisingly he was driving a Mustang GT and clocked me as he was travelling in the other direction at night time in pitch black conditions."
776055,Gerritt,2013-03-28 13:24:00,6129, 30 MPH difference.... or ab 60 KM/h over the speed limit... Do that today and your car is impounded and up to a 10k fine... @ 20bux seems pretty reasonable to me.   PS... radar works day and night  G
776081,Marty,2013-03-28 17:00:00,873,Where in PA did it happen?    I might be able to help you out.
776089,RJackson,2013-03-28 17:19:00,113,"You were in that much of a rush to get home from Florida Louis?  Pay the fine and you'll be fine, don't and get caught in PA again and you could be on the next episode of ""Cops"".  RJ"
776109,aplumma,2013-03-28 19:04:00,6896,  Hey Marty how are you in Virginia ticket repairs??? lol Can you hook a brother up when he needs it.   Art
776225,pikehunter,2013-03-29 03:26:00,1659,"    It was, he knocked it down quite a bit.  No kidding eh, radar works in the dark. It was a surprise (back then) to get nabbed by a rolling radar, shocking to see the lights start flashing in the pitch black then do a u turn and fly up behind me. I was waiting for a shot gun to greet me when I turned my head to the side window. Probably would have had it out and ready if he figured I had been a local boy  and not a tourist driving an obvious rental car with Alamo flashed across the rear bumper and bar code stickers all over the windows."
776228,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-29 03:49:00,8243,"I received a pretty hefty ticket on the Mass. Pike for around $150.00 back in 1975, that was a lot of money then, even now. I was surprised he didn't drag me back to Boston. I never paid it, and I looked over my shoulder for years when in the states. Still do.  Pay the ticket, I wish I had even though it was almost what I paid for the car.  PAY THE TICKET, PLEASE  "
776249,aniceguy,2013-03-29 13:03:00,1094,it happened in Mercer county about 80 miles south or Erie PA
775740,aniceguy,2013-03-26 19:37:00,1094,Yup got a ticket to the policemans ball.  Im going to pay the ticket but before I send money I wanted to know does thespeeding ticket I got in Pennsylvania show up on an insurance abstract or with the MTo  after being paid here.I haver been trying to see if there is a recripical aggreement but cant find a definative answer on my questio.n  It means the difference between going there/hiring a local lawyer or just paying the fine.  I figure there are so many people here someone has had this experience.
775743,Moosebunk,2013-03-26 19:43:00,3970,"Does a speeding ticket in Pennslyvania effect us here???   Well... if it wasn't one of us that got the ticket, then no... it doesn't.     Just playing witchya Louis!  Can't help ya though really."
775744,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-26 19:46:00,10439,"Nope, doesn't effect me at all.   :tease:  Won't effect you either. The only time other forces South of the 49th contact our forces up here is when they are looking for someone that did something bad in their juristiction. They don't give a crap about tickets."
775751,craigdritchie,2013-03-26 20:10:00,1586,"A ticket in and of itself shouldn't  affect you at all, providing (1) you pay it and (2) it's not something that would mean points had you been pulled over in Ontario."
775755,davey buoy,2013-03-26 21:09:00,5505,"I had one going through Washington on the way to Myrtle beach,back than you paid on the spot,no one new noothiiing!I think out of state out of mind."
775761,Nipfisher,2013-03-26 21:22:00,2449,I paid an illegal u-turn ticket in Florida via VISA when I got back home. Cost me about $270 Can. Never impacted me or showed up on any abstract.
775765,FrankTheRabbit,2013-03-26 21:39:00,479,You could try and get new plates for your car? Might be cheaper than paying the ticket if you plan on travelling said vehicle back to the States down the road.
775766,davey buoy,2013-03-26 21:45:00,5505,I'm sure it's not quite that easy. Just talked to a friend that received a ticket in New Jersey 5 weeks ago. About 3 weeks ago he received it in the mail.Paid it by money order. He also believes it won't reflect on his insurance.
775767,BillM,2013-03-26 21:50:00,17367," Your name and license # are still linked to that infraction.  If he gets pulled over in PA again and there's a warrant out for him, he'll be in hot water.  Not worth it for $250 or whatever it is.. Pay the fine."
775768,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 21:52:00,2540,Yes it does
775769,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 21:53:00,2540,Anything in the northern US effects your driving record and shows on the MTO recorda
775771,davey buoy,2013-03-26 21:56:00,5505,"Really ?,even small speeding tickets?.Accidents I can see."
775774,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 22:01:00,2540,"Yup, even out of province. Mainly Quebec.  Usually only NY, Oh, PA, MI. I have seen New Hampshire as well"
775775,irishfield,2013-03-26 22:03:00,26272,"Thank God there was no internet sharing in years past.. when they were busy stapling up ""don't rent to this guy"" posters on Carribean Islands.... ;O)"
775776,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 22:04:00,2540,Just remember traffic court isn't a dog and pony show in the US like it is here
775777,HTHM,2013-03-26 22:06:00,4082,What DO you see on the computer when you pull someone over?
775778,BillM,2013-03-26 22:10:00,17367, I doubt he'll tell you that.
775779,aplumma,2013-03-26 22:11:00,6896,I would send the money in and pay the ticket. If you get a ticket in any of the 48 states and you return to them any infraction will come up again if you are South of the border. I don't think that your insurance will get the report if they check. I do know the court system has no issues with warrents if it goes unpaid regardless of where you live it is issued and will come up on any name/license run thru by law officers.   Art
775782,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 22:13:00,2540,"Lol that's confidential information lol...  Plate info... Tombstone info on registered owner, tombstone info on driver, license status, criminal and provincial convictions, our local info on the person I ran if any and any other info"
775783,aplumma,2013-03-26 22:18:00,6896,"This is cut and paste  When I conduct a car stop, I approach and request some form of identification. I prefer a driver's license, but lacking that I can work with a Social Security number or even just a name and a date of birth (bear in mind, though, that if an adult claims to not know their SSN, they're getting some serious scrutiny - this was more often than not the hallmark of someone trying to conceal their identity).With that information in hand, I return to my patrol car. From here, procedures will vary by agency, but in telling you my process know that it will be largely the same anywhere you go. I would first get on an administrative radio channel set up for this purpose and ""run your information"" through the dispatcher. This consisted of giving your name, date of birth, gender, race, and driver's license or SS number over the radio. The dispatcher queries their systems with this information, and checks for multiple information items: While dispatch is working on all of this, I will input your information into the laptop in my patrol car. I will then be able to see most everything dispatch does (in my case, just about everything except local warrants). In the case of your not having hard ID, I can search by your SSN, and if you've got a license I'll be able to see the information on it and get your DoR picture to confirm your identity. I'll also run your license plate through my computer, which will tell me whether the plates or the vehicle are listed as stolen and what vehicle they're supposed to be on.Once dispatch returns their information, I'll wrap up the stop accordingly. If there's a warrant, I will of course get another unit and begin the arrest process. If not, I'll decide whether to issue any citations, then return to your vehicle to return your paperwork and release you with either a warning or your citation(s). Law enforcement personnel enjoy what is termed ""officer discretion"" during a vehicle stop - they have personal latitude in whether or not to enforce a given law/ordinance in a given situation. In your listed circumstance, the officer decided not to ticket you for the stop sign or the seat belt violations, so once he ensured you were not wanted, he released you. This was probably the case in 40-60% of my traffic stops. I often initiated traffic stops knowing that, barring unforeseen circumstances, I was only going to issue a warning. This served several purposes:"
775785,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 22:21:00,2540,Ya the US do things way different
775788,Garnet,2013-03-26 22:38:00,2056,It's a state by state deal. If Canada has agreement with the state they share information. Surpising that all border states have agreement and most for popular routes to Florida.  I was fishing a Team Ontario Tournament in Conneticat a couple years ago and 1 of the people got a ticket but Canada doesn't have agreement so they wern't going to pay it.
775789,fishing n autograph,2013-03-26 22:39:00,2540,And that person will have a warrant for his arrest when he goes back lol
775790,nlpaintballer,2013-03-26 22:54:00,122,"Yep, and any point loss will also count. My roomate just went through this 3 weeks ago facing a couple hundred and points. Cost him 400 to have xcopper fight it and got it changed to a parking violation with no loss of points."
775791,davey buoy,2013-03-26 23:04:00,5505,"Good for him,but how can they change the charge like that?"
