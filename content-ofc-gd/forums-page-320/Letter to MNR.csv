Fedeli read a Members’ Statement confirming the Minister has rejected the stakeholders bid to establish a self-funded restocking initiative in response to the recent decision to reduce the daily walleye catch limit on Lake Nipissing from four to two.   The statement also cited concerns raised by the Municipality of Callander Council in a recent resolution that was adopted. The prepared text of MPP Fedeli’s statement is as follows:    Speaker, Lake Nipissing stakeholders are beside themselves after recent discussions with the Ministry of Natural Resources, who recently reduced the daily catch limits for walleye on Lake Nipissing from four to two.   Despite being presented with scientific evidence in support of a significant restocking effort, the Minister has decided to maintain the status quo. Even though the stakeholders have stated they view this as a temporary solution, you’ve slammed the door on them, and their livelihoods in the process.   The Municipality of Callander passed a resolution in January that asks you to reconsider the daily catch limit decision and asks “the Ministry of Natural Resources increase the support for, and provide additional resources dedicated towards alternative actions to address the decline in the Walleye population, including but not limited to, additional fishing opportunities for other species, consistent enforcement of regulations and daily catch limits and community-based restocking programs.""   Minister, Lake Nipissing stakeholders are ready to move forward with restocking initiatives they will fund completely. Why are you standing in their way instead of working with them on solutions going forward? "

If my opinion is at all correct, then here is my supposition: they are not allowing the private stakeholders to stock the lake because, there isn't a need for it (fish pop's are not that bad) and the MNR is trying to reduce their own and private industry involvement. What they may be aiming for is a larger contribution from FIrst Nations on Lake Nipissing (and other lakes), which may mean that they are leaning towards the FN doing more in terms of lake management and/or stocking. The FN already wants more control of these things and some bands already do significant stocking/management programs. If the MNR is starting to pass-on the torch, then they won't be making any significant management decisions...as we are seeing right now.   The way I see it, the FN may actually do a better job at managing the lake than the MNR ever has.... if they have full control and the proper resources. How many of you are actually happy with the way the MNR manages things up north, or anywhere else for that matter? They keep getting cut back and seem to have less and less ability/talent to actually make proper decisions. If the FN have it their way, I think they'll do a great job because they won't hold a grudge anymore and they'll be working with a lot of pride...with a lot of prove.  All my opinion.... The MNR just seems to be at a stalemate on this topic, to me, this is a valid hypothesis."

752102,John Bacon,2012-12-15 22:14:00,3277, Store bought fish are either commerically caught wild fish or farmed fish.  I am not sure how purchasing a commercially caught wild fish from the store instead of keeping one that I caught myself is going to help the fishery. I believe that Lake Nippissing has a commercial fisher on it so the store bought fish may have come from the lake anyway. How is that a solution?  Even if it is a farmed fish it has probably been fed food that is manufactured from wild caught fish.  I don't see how purchasing fish from a store instead of keeping our own catch is a solution to declining wild fish stocks.
752124,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-16 00:08:00,1622," No I'm saying it's a problem every where, some people just don't care,  I'm 52 yrs old & heard of people fishing like that even 30 years ago & have made a few calls to Tips, usually I have a CO return my call Tight Lines SBK"
752129,Rockview,2012-12-16 00:34:00,6,"From http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/management/myths.html  “On any given day, 95 percent of walleye anglers harvest two or fewer walleyes. This generally holds true on every walleye lake in Minnesota and across the U.S.”  I’m extrapolating this to Ontario but I suspect that it holds true – an informal survey of other resort owners in the area supports it. If this is even close to correct for Ontario/Lake Nipissing then a reduction from 4 to 2 Walleye on Lake Nipissing will make almost no difference. It’s clear that the MNR is making this change only for the sake of perception but unfortunately the perception for tourists will be that it's not worth the bother to come to Lake Nipissing.  Also, for what it's worth the Walleye fishing was great this year for small Walleye (13-16 inches) and will be for the next several years due to strong year classes from 2009 to 2012. The concern is over the very low adult Walleye population.  Regulating/reducing the commerical fishery would be one possibility but I have yet to hear anyone suggest how to make this happen. Even if the Province of Ontario/Federal Government wanted to make this happen, I'm not sure they currently have the legal right to restrict it.  We are advocating re-stocking as a way to help improve the Walleye population. It might not be the be all and end all solution but it will at least make a positive contribution. Constant complaining about First Nations commerical fishing has acheived nothing."
752132,fishindevil,2012-12-16 00:48:00,6254,Lets face the facts it's no different than all the other walleye reg changes it's 20 yrs too late just like the kawarthas we all told the MNR back in the early 90s that the walleye pop was way down and it takes forever to do studies and biologist reports when the regular fisherman that fishes it all the time knows long before what's really happening !!!! It's too little to too late and the same thing is going on in the bay of quinte it crashed hard in the 90s and is slowly slowly Comming back but will never be the same !!! It's also the changing ecosystem as well and warmer water and climate change its all a mess and not ever gonna get better !!!!!! Ever...... Private stocking and fishing clubs have to take matters into there own hands !!! Just like all the salmon rearing going on in all the harbors in Lake Ontario it's all about fishing clubs not the MNR !!!! They have cut all funding for fishing projects to the core !!!! So it really is all about us looking after the entire mess

752138,kickingfrog,2012-12-16 01:13:00,8333,"Stocking can help, but as mentioned it is not the be all to end all.  Stocking, on its own, often is little more than a ineffective stop-gap.  If there is spawning habitat loss then stocking is at best a put and take situation.  If cormorants are eating too many baitfish then it doesn't matter how many walleye are stocked, there will not be enough baitfish for them to grow/survive anyway.  If invasive species are changing the lake's ""make-up""….  If anglers are keeping more fish than the lake can sustain...  This is a complex issue it can't be solved with a single solution or quick fixes."
752140,Rockview,2012-12-16 01:20:00,6, There is definitely no single magic solution. Doing nothing certainly isn't a good solution. Endless studying won't help.  Trying some potential solutions with limited downside risk and monitoring the results is a good idea. With respect to Lake Nipissing's specific conditions the worst thing that can result from re-stocking is no change. The potential for improvement is significant.
752220,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-16 15:04:00,1622,"I'm not an expert but the people making the decision likely aren't either, take a look at the Saugeen River, different fish & everything but the Stocking done by the Lake Huron Fishing Club & the Ontario Steelheaders have made that an amazing fisheries, so I would think if the stocking is done with the right size of Walleye & the habitat is there it shouldn't hurt & it surely could help, doing nothing definitely won't, people need to jump on board by joining these club to give them any & all the help they need, Numbers talk so lets make these groups bigger so the MNR have to listen to us, could be time to crap or get off the pot.

I don't suppose that any groups on the Saugeen run nets across the river in the spring of fall to harvest these fish?

That cheddar is ours to be used to benefit us, not commercial interests who make off like bandits.

Minister, you have taken the easy way out rather than perform due diligence in finding a longterm solution in the best interests of all Lake Nipissing stakeholders and interests. In my letter to you dated August 28, 2012, I outlined possible solutions and causes that needed to be examined with regards to declining walleye stocks prior to any management action to reduce catch limits.  You and your Ministry have been silent on these suggestions, so I can only assume I was correct in my August letter when I stated you had already made up your mind at that time.  If you had done your job, you would know that there are Lake Nipissing stakeholders ready to pay for and fully implement a walleye restocking program for the lake on their own without government assistance. Restocking has been scientifically been shown to be effective elsewhere. All they need, Minister, is your approval to proceed.  I will again point out that Lake Nipissing’s cormorant population has been allowed to grow over the last decade. The birds now take over 100,000 kilograms of fish – more than four times what anglers draw from the lake. You and your Ministry can no longer ignore this issue and need to address it directly.  Minister, tourist operators around Lake Nipissing started receiving cancellation requests within hours of this decision becoming public. They should not have to pay for your Liberal government’s years of failure and mismanagement of this fishery. It’s time you admit this decision is wrong-headed and short-sighted. There is still time for you to reverse it and engage with stakeholders to find a long-term solution. I look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely, Vic Fedeli MPP Nipissing"

The simple fact is this is a 20 year (at least) problem in the making and needs a 20 year (at least) solution and that is beyond what any political party can, or is willing, to do  Much of the Canadian fishing tourism is made up of Americans. The American economy has been in a down turn and our dollar has been on par for 4-5 years. Those are two huge factors for some of our American friends.  Couple that with what we have all read here, and elsewhere, some very negative reports form anglers that have had limited success on Nipissing the last number of years as well. That also has an effect on people spending hard earned dollars for a vacation.  No doubt the reduced limit will have some looking elsewhere, but how often will people keep coming back to a place that doesn't produce the number of fish desired in the first place regardless of limits?"

If someone told me I had to eat half the pizza I do now, because of a tomato shortage, then I wouldnt be too upset about that... Get over yourselves, and start taking responsibility for your actions.

752033,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-15 16:49:00,1622,"There are lots of people that go catch 4, 5 or 6 fish depending on the species & the Limit, go home clean & go back to do this again, 2 or 3 times a day & maybe numerous days in a row, they are worried about getting caught going home but not worried about getting checked when their catch is cleaned & put in their freezer or given away & go back & catch another limit the same day, if you drop the limit to 2 that means if they keep doing that now they will have 6 fish a day taken home in 1 day instead of 15 or 18 fish a day, I really don't think anyone needs that much in their freezer but maybe I'm wrong, 1 easy thing to do is take picture, document what you see & report it Just My .02 Tight Lines SBK"
752045,Headhunter,2012-12-15 18:04:00,5703,"Unfortunately, taking the ""suck it up"" position means that we will not have learned a thing from the past, when the lake had to be re-stocked because of netting devastation. The more things change, the more they stay the same. HH"
752046,Rich Nelson,2012-12-15 18:07:00,332,"When I said suck it up, I was refering to accepting the lower limits...Its a start. Maybe these guys would prefer to keep on eating everything they catch, and wondering in 10 years why they no longer have a sustainable fishery."

752051,Headhunter,2012-12-15 18:22:00,5703,"The vast majority of anglers follow the rules... that's been my experience. Those who don't should be caught and punished by the law. The anglers who don't shouldn't have to pay a price because others don't play far. The whole thing is so obvious, but essentially, if they made Nip a catch and release only lake for Pickereyes, it would still be doomed to the same fate. Sure it may take a little longer, but it will happen. If all parties agreed to cutting their numbers in half, more enforcement of regs and agreements, then using science to determin next courses, then I for one would understand that being a positive go forward position. So far only one group has been made to ""take one"" for the lake. HH"

Is that asking too much for paying a years licence? I'm a fruit and veggie farmer and cannot take time to fish in the summer. Some people are not meat-hungry fisherman."
