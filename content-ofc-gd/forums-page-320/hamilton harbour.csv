776239,Rich,2013-03-29 12:01:00,3927,"Yeah, you're right. My favourite part was when the OP came back and better explained his question, then thanked everyone for the advice.  Oh wait, he didn't. It's almost like it was a troll post! But nobody trolls these days, our bad."
776250,DoubleDigits,2013-03-29 13:08:00,140,"Wow dude, dont get your hairnet in a knot! Quite the overreaction to a simple question, woudn't you say?"
776283,SirCranksalot,2013-03-29 17:59:00,3291,"If I had gotten that type of response I wouldn't come back either to explain(as for 'thanks', what's there to thank for?)"
776302,Rich,2013-03-29 20:32:00,3927,"There was plenty of advice given, hence the reason the hate on rich started."
776305,Spiel,2013-03-29 20:50:00,9065, Best post in the entire useless thread!
776310,hammercarp,2013-03-29 21:46:00,964,Truthfully I was expecting the OP to come back and qualify his question. That was why I had a one word reply.
776502,Garry2Rs,2013-03-30 23:35:00,1425,It must be the warming weather...The Saps are rising!
774853,robby150,2013-03-20 21:56:00,1,has anyone fished in Hamilton harbor 
774862,Christopheraaron,2013-03-20 22:19:00,3525,"YES. Bit of a short first post, maybe write something about yourself, what do you like to fish for? Where are you from? You'll get a lot more responses if you do"
774876,Rich,2013-03-20 23:36:00,3927,No. Nobody has ever fished there.
775171,hammercarp,2013-03-22 14:59:00,964,Yes.
775173,BITEME,2013-03-22 15:11:00,1968,maybe
775174,fishindevil,2013-03-22 15:12:00,6254,kind of sort of ??
775220,The JAY,2013-03-22 21:14:00,239,Never heard of it....  Getting the sarcasm yet? A bit more of a 'hello' and a better worded question would go a long way...
775225,ccmtcanada,2013-03-22 21:50:00,7971,I actually haven't fished there.  Interested in the replies. Lol.
775237,moxie,2013-03-22 22:52:00,1566,Hamilton? hehehe.
775246,Locnar,2013-03-22 23:49:00,645,I haven't. I would be interested in givin'r a go... but I just don't find myself in the hammer too often.
775250,Rich,2013-03-22 23:58:00,3927,"It's got fish in it, like any other part of a great lake. Actually, its got all kinds. Everywhere I go, I follow a rule. If it looks fishy, it is, to some degree. Go try it, and let us know how you did."
775251,family guy,2013-03-23 00:08:00,22,"I have only done a little bit of carp fishing there(with success), but I have heard that there is good bass, pike and pan fish there.  I even think that some of our ontario fishing celebrities have done some tv shows there.  Try some google searches and you might find some of those episodes."
775355,Garry2Rs,2013-03-24 02:27:00,1425,"There is a fishing area behind Hutch's on Bay St. North.  I have been there for Perch in the Spring. I have also seen Trout, Pike, Sheep-head and Bass caught there."
775370,Rich,2013-03-24 11:16:00,3927,"Wow, even with the poorest first post ever, he still gets a lot of info. Nice!"
776121,registerfly,2013-03-28 20:37:00,198,"may be the poorest first post but you've posted more than him LOL. God forbid he asked us for some spots  Yes there are fish, depending upon season and welcome. Introduce yourself and let us get to know you, but won't blame you if you decline based upon your reception. Let us know how you do.  cheers"
776153,Rich,2013-03-28 23:07:00,3927,
776155,Locnar,2013-03-28 23:09:00,645,"Rich, according to the stats listed underneath your name... it says you have posted 7273 posts... 7273 posts vs. 1 post... I'd say you got him beat."
776156,Rich,2013-03-28 23:12:00,3927,Well that's certainly not at all what it's about but I am glad to say I've been a part of this community a long time..
776173,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-29 00:04:00,8243,"I've never fished Hamilton Harbor but walked across it once in the summer of 72'. Actually born, bred in Hamilton and worked on the shore of that harbor for many years. We can all complain about the various governments we have but somebody did  something right for once. It sickens me to remember what we dumped in there, it sickened me then as well. I could write a book."
776176,SirCranksalot,2013-03-29 00:09:00,3291,"Probably some pretty heavy fish, what with all the metals being discharged........."
776182,Locnar,2013-03-29 00:26:00,645,"Heavy metal fish, thrashing and moshing since the 1980s"
776207,registerfly,2013-03-29 01:58:00,198,"oops I actually meant you've posted quite a bit on this thread all things considered, but hey if you've been around for a long time, more power to ya!!  but seriously fishing out of this end of Lake O is definitely C&R, highest levels of contaminants in the entire lake."
776208,irishfield,2013-03-29 02:00:00,26272,"Reading through this thread I wonder why there's no forward motion here or new members that participate. Run'm off... full steam ahead guys, go for it. Like anyone needs to protect good old hamilton harbour. Hang your heads lads..."
776212,Roy,2013-03-29 02:21:00,13728,"Let's all try to behave...at least 'til Sunday, or the the Easter bunny won't show up."
776219,irishfield,2013-03-29 02:48:00,26272,I have to pick her up at the airport tomorrow....
