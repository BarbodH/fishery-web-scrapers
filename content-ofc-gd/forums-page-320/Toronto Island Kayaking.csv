775543,juan96,2013-03-25 17:26:00,23,Hello  I planning kayaking to Toronto island from Toronto harbor  this Saturday. Anybody know where I can park my vehicle ?  Also is it open pike fishing in Toronto island now?
775547,hotsky,2013-03-25 17:35:00,400,"pretty sure pike season closes end of March so you're good for now, cant really help with other questions since I dont live there...."
775548,Roy,2013-03-25 17:45:00,13728,Pike is open year round on Lake O. Check the regs.
775549,Christopheraaron,2013-03-25 17:47:00,3525,"You should be fine, I'd focus on the bigger canals, a lot of stuff was still locked up last week."
775556,kemper,2013-03-25 18:37:00,2232,"Don't fall in. That water is ice cold and can get real choppy with the right winds.  Look for weeds if you can find any, there is a ton of pike out there."
775557,kemper,2013-03-25 18:39:00,2232,"Side note - always check the regs before heading out if you're unsure. People here are knowledgeable but if they get it wrong you will have a hard time arguing that ""BigBass328 from OFC"" said it was open officer, I swear."
775565,SylvanOwner,2013-03-25 19:42:00,266," In the interest of preventing an unecessary charge, for the original OP or others, I have to respectfully point out that pike is closed April 1st until the first Saturday in May on Lake Ontario/Zone 20."
775575,Freshtrax,2013-03-25 20:33:00,2215,"May also need a harbour permit for the kayak, not sure but you might want to check"
775576,Freshtrax,2013-03-25 20:40:00,2215,"I checked powerd vessels only, from what I read"
775577,grizzlybri,2013-03-25 20:43:00,565,"As far as parking there is a large parking lot at Queens Quay west and Young , it is right beside Captain John's harbor boat restaurant. I use this parking lot each time i go to the island."
775579,woodenboater,2013-03-25 20:52:00,2277,"If you don't want to paddle in from Cherry Beach, then I would suggest someplace near the sailing school where the canoes and kayaks are stored. It's an easy carry down the ramp to the dock. Most other lots will not have easy access to the water.  Also be mindful of where you are re: island airport. There's a marked off area for float planes and the marine police may come out to remind you to not stray into that area (I still ended up inside the buoys despite my best efforts lol).  fwiw, it's a nice paddle from Cherry Beach and it's early enough in the season that sail and powerboats probably won't cause any problems in the gap. As others have said, stay in your boat and have a complete change of dry clothes in a drybag. If you have proper safety equipment (legal requirement) then you will have a whistle or sounding device on you for emergencies if that should arise).  "
775587,BITEME,2013-03-25 21:29:00,1968,Find somewhere to park drop it in and stay around the island you will slay pike and big
775591,Roy,2013-03-25 21:40:00,13728,"OOPS   there's a perfect example of why you should not anyone's word regarding fishing regulations. For some unknown reason, I was looking at Lake E regs.  Read them yourself again. Sorry."
775592,hotsky,2013-03-25 21:42:00,400,Roy you got me all excited there for a min; I was really hoping I was wrong. lol
775593,Christopheraaron,2013-03-25 21:53:00,3525,"For those interested there is a good lot at harbourfront place, $11 for the day. Bit of a paddle from there though"
775733,SirWhite,2013-03-26 18:48:00,210,  This is true
776078,pylon,2013-03-28 16:50:00,68,Cherry beach has free parking at the east end of the island. Easy paddle to the harbour. Just follow cherry st south from the end of the gardener
776392,yakpiker,2013-03-30 14:45:00,160,"oh, if only it was this easy...3 hours on the water yesterday and saw 1 big carp...still lots of ice on the inner channels including by the rowing course"
