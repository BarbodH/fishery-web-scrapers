776332,adempsey,2013-03-30 01:31:00,1498,"I've watched a lot of videos on how people do it and it doesn't seem overly difficult. So, I am sure you could easily do it yourself by making a silicon mold.  http://makelure.com/HowTos.cfm  http://makelure.com/HowTos/Swim%20Whiz%20How%20To%201%20piece.pdf"
