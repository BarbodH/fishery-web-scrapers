776440,davey buoy,2013-03-30 19:18:00,5505,You sure did have a good year from what I've seen!!! Can't wait till boat time as well.
776444,RickOnt,2013-03-30 19:27:00,669,"Davey Did you get out to the 'River'?  I was over to Keswick,  On my travels I noticed the Holland River is open in Bradford and at the Queensvile SideRoad.  Not ice free in Keswick but a lot of open spots at Riveredge.  The Black River in Sutton is open as is the Pefferlaw River  So with the Rivers running the Lake won't be far behind  Rick"
776448,davey buoy,2013-03-30 19:33:00,5505,"Yes I did, sure nice to get that started again!!!!!"
776451,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-30 19:39:00,8243,"Hey Rick, they just announced that perch quotas for commercial guys in Ontario has been reduced by 10% for this year. If you left 10% of your haul for guys like me who have to wait for ice out would be very gentlemanly of you. That's a beauty mess of yellows you have there, good going."
776452,Joey,2013-03-30 19:41:00,9122,Nice mess of perch Rick.  I passed by the Holland in Bradford yesterday too and noticed it was wide open.  Lots of anglers on the West side of the bridge!
776453,davey buoy,2013-03-30 19:42:00,5505,"From what I've seen this last month or two,there sure is no shortage of big and small Perch in that lake.They seem to reproduce like rabbits lol."
