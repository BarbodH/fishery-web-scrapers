775409,lew,2013-03-24 18:19:00,12766,"I've been finding the ""new & improved"" photobucket fairly easy to until today.  Normally when posting a picture, I just hi-lite the IMG code under the picture, copy it,  and then paste it where I want.  Today though I can't even hi-lite the code, let alone copy it.  Anyone else having the same issues ??"
775412,lew,2013-03-24 18:35:00,12766,"Seems like now if I click on the code  6 or 7 times I can get it to work.  Not the way it's sposed to work, but  maybe there's a glitch in their system.  "
775413,misfish,2013-03-24 18:39:00,29133,"Lets see,,,,,,,,,,,,  "
775414,misfish,2013-03-24 18:40:00,29133,"Yup it works bud. Just click on the img link. Then paste it . It,s auto now."
775416,lew,2013-03-24 18:49:00,12766,"I've got it working now too Brian, but I have to click the code a bunch of times before it hi-lites.  Oh well, better than nothing I spose.  And  nice fish you got there too my friend.  "
775417,misfish,2013-03-24 18:51:00,29133," Ya,I was ICE FISHING,  Now what the heck,did you do to that nice boat?"
775419,lew,2013-03-24 18:54:00,12766," Why, what's wrong with my boat ??"
775422,misfish,2013-03-24 19:09:00,29133,"All I see is,places to hang lures. How the heck do ya cast in there?LOL  It does look good,but it looks kinda OLD SCHOOL."
775423,lew,2013-03-24 19:26:00,12766,"When your my age Brian, everything is old school"
775431,Tim Mills,2013-03-24 21:56:00,476,Lew- if you can get photobucket to co-operate it would be nice to see some close ups of those mounts.  Boat and garage envy huge.
775437,lew,2013-03-24 22:37:00,12766,"Nothing outstanding about those fish, but the one on the right was the 1st musky I ever caught about 4 decades ago. Sadly in those days   it was normal to kill the fish and have it mounted. It's the only one out of many though that I ever intentionally killed.  Here's a picture of it when we got back to shore and the 2nd picture was when I got it back from the taxidermist.      The musky in the middle was caught  by accident by  my wife about 20 years ago while she was looking for pickerel off the end of the dock for breakfast and it died before she could get the hook out. A friend of mine is a taxidermist so he mounted it for her.  The bass was one that died when the hook tore the gills so My friend mounted it for practice many years ago."
775441,Rich Clemens,2013-03-24 23:11:00,3131,So .... That's how it all started.
775442,lew,2013-03-24 23:21:00,12766,"Yup, and it's been a long and fun trip ever since Rich !!"
775452,Rich Clemens,2013-03-24 23:53:00,3131,Indeed it is
775461,Leecher,2013-03-25 00:35:00,7832," Lew,  Once you have uploaded your pics to Photobucket into an album, mouse over the picture you want to post and you'll see a wheel appear at the top right, mouse over the wheel and click on ""get links..."" then click IMG Codes field, you'll see a tiny popup displaying ""copied""  Tab over to OFC and right click in your post and select paste and that's it  This is the new way now on Photobucket Jacques"
775486,Moosebunk,2013-03-25 03:05:00,3970,"Getting used to this new PB today too Lew.  It ain't all that bad, but who wants change from what was working fine. lol"
775500,lew,2013-03-25 08:29:00,12766,"Thanks Jacques, that's a bit different than I normally do but it seems to work well.  And your right Drew, it's not  always necessary to fix things that ain't broke"
776337,Twocoda,2013-03-30 02:22:00,4130,You had the best of both worlds Lew.....a taxidermist and a camera
