775828,Marko,2013-03-27 02:18:00,854,I also saw a guy the same day getting fined for walking on the train tracks. He was none to happy about it. As we were walkin towards the creek CO was there in his pick up and told us to stay off the train tracks. Apperantly this year they started fining people for that
775832,BillM,2013-03-27 02:32:00,17367, The one of the many reasons why I do not fish the east ditches..
775834,kemper,2013-03-27 02:35:00,2232," No kidding.  Unfortunately I'm out that way in the spring most of the time, and for midweek trips it just makes sense.  In the fall on the other hand...  You're lucky to have the water you do close by"

775846,Angel_Fish,2013-03-27 05:13:00,6,"That's what I like to hear!!  Often, when the man and I are going for walks in the off season and we see people clearly targeting and poaching fish out of season in sanctuaries we stop and try to educate them ourselves.  I find the lack of officials in our area appauling, but we definitely do our part to conserve every species.  Thanks to everyone who helps along their travels to educate...new and established Canadians alike!"
775848,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-27 05:55:00,8243,"Good to hear there are a few CO's out doing there jobs. Need a few more to be sure. We certainly could use as many as possible. I have only been inspected twice out here in Haldimand Norfolk in 30 years. It's a lot of water to cover but 1 boat could check as many anglers they wanted to on any weekend at the mouth of the Grand or at Nanticoke, from late spring to labour day. I used to remind some un educated homegrown or otherwise, then I realized 90% knew where they were and what they were doing. I've gotten everything from how do you know I'm not native to mind your own business, you can tell who needs a copy of the regs which I used to carry a few with me, there free. I don't bother any longer, no need, speed dial the local office. Or star OPP when I don't get a real person on the phone at the ministry . Everyone today is a tough guy and I don't want to get shot or stabbed over a fish. That sounds nuts but who knows today. Selling fresh for a few bucks a pound for a 15 buck a pound fish to get whatever they need is not nuts today, unfortunately."
775869,Rich,2013-03-27 12:57:00,3927,"I'm checked a half dozen times a year in this area. They don't often bother with anything but poaching trout and salmon, or overharvesting perch. Call in HN about someone spearing or snagging trout, they'll show up. Call about someone raping bass off beds, they ask you to take pictures and never show up to look at them."
775871,206,2013-03-27 13:11:00,563,Hope this makes the paper...At least get there names out there and maybe sway others to abide or take notice.
775878,DOS,2013-03-27 14:07:00,119,"Made my day,  like to see more of this...  RED"
775896,misfish,2013-03-27 15:35:00,29133," 5 ft,boy thats generous.LOL"
775917,mr blizzard,2013-03-27 18:04:00,1589,Looks good on them to bad the penalties were not stiffer.
776016,Carp,2013-03-28 03:35:00,1488,Love it !!!
776020,Woodsman,2013-03-28 04:17:00,1286,"Where do you get this from? In most cases they are provincial charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997. In most cases they are not criminal code charges which are the ones which will effect getting a bond."
776021,BillM,2013-03-28 04:35:00,17367,"These are Provincial charges, not Federal..."
776023,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-03-28 08:35:00,83,Looks good on them.
776039,Garnet,2013-03-28 11:24:00,2056,"Really to bad, federal charges would be nice.  Yesterday their were 5 more guys fishing under the bridge. They missed the memo."
776056,SirCranksalot,2013-03-28 13:32:00,3291,I'm surprised you would warn that guy. Why not just let the a'hole get fined??
776243,esoxansteel,2013-03-29 12:38:00,1307," I use too fish your water too Bill, but seeing stringers of 5 fish been dragged off the Bighead, Thornbury, and Notty turned me off, plus its the same distance for me to go there, as it is for you to come hear, plus ive seen 2 19 pound fish and 1 knockin on 20 from an east ditch this year, and never seen one like that in GB, also fishing the east ditches keeps me in shape, as im nearing 50, and much older then you, and am always good for one to 2 fights per year, which could probably do you good as well,  and get you in shape as many of the trip pics we see you on your always passed out or asleep LOL"
776248,GarageDoorGuy,2013-03-29 12:59:00,10,They should put a large board right by the CN bridge with mug shots of people that get caught fishing north of it! that may persuade some to think twice
776261,Photoz,2013-03-29 14:28:00,792,"Sending a game warden down to the trestle will get a few illegal anglers, but I think an even more important undertaking would be to have some one from the ministry in plain clothes checking out 3 or 4 trout spots and nail a few that are paying no attention to the NEW limit of 2 trout!! A picture does little good, nor does a phone call, they have to be caught in the act. There are some of these clowns who catch 2 for themselves, then 2 for their kids, or some fishing buddy. I saw a guy with his 2 kids last week, they were about 9  -  10 years old, and having a helluva good time tossing rocks in the water, while good ol' Dad warched the 3 rods that were set! Not much you can do about that . . . .   I was hoping they'd get 2 fish on . . . .   the kids were away down the beach skippin' rocks . . . .   goodbye to 1 rod anyway!"

775716,chris.brock,2013-03-26 17:27:00,4053,it looks like there's a guy behind the street sign continuing to fish

775722,BucktownAngler,2013-03-26 17:40:00,582,what were they doing wrong?
775724,porkpie,2013-03-26 17:50:00,2521,"Served them right!  They were told, and new full well what they where doing!"
775726,kemper,2013-03-26 18:00:00,2232," Fishing in a sanctuary.  At Port Hope you can't fish ""North of the Southern limit"" of the CNR right of way.  They were likely under the bridge fishing the pipe which people have been doing forever even though it is clearly written in the regs."

775745,Moosebunk,2013-03-26 19:51:00,3970,Solid!  Cool pic of the action too.
775747,Christopheraaron,2013-03-26 20:02:00,3525,"Nice! Ya I was there the other day and there was one guy casting just above the southern side of the bridge (prob about 1m) but didn't call, figured they wouldn't show."
775749,jimmer,2013-03-26 20:08:00,2730,We need more of them out there to catch people that don't care. They seem to care after they're caught though.
775762,esoxansteel,2013-03-26 21:28:00,1307,"What a way to make my day, great report and love the action shot,"
775763,Marko,2013-03-26 21:31:00,854,When i drove by last saturday there were about 6 guys fishing under the bridge.....and that bridge isnt all that wide lol my mom hates me serves them right
775797,Garnet,2013-03-26 23:20:00,2056,I left at 5:30 and theirs a guy fishing under the bridge.  It's a double deal fish and game charges are federal offences so getting bonded will be a problem.
775801,kemper,2013-03-26 23:31:00,2232,What makes me laugh is that some people will risk heavy fines and possible loss of equipment to fish literally 5 feet further upstream than the next guy.  I just don't get it.
775802,Rod Caster,2013-03-26 23:33:00,5784,So it's a sanctuary but the guy in the far right of the photo looks like he's still casting?? I suppose the bridge is the boundary and those goons were fishing under the bridge?
775803,Radnine,2013-03-26 23:36:00,1538,"Want to put a bet on their level of education? $180 is almost two weeks worth of smokes! And, wait a second, they look too tall to be asian.......... Jim"
775806,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-26 23:41:00,10439," Yep, all Asian people are four foot nuthin' and wear coke bottle glasses.  http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yao_ming/  "
775812,Garnet,2013-03-26 23:53:00,2056,On the left of that photo is CN bridge you need to be south of this bridge. Buddy on right is fishing legal.
775826,chessy,2013-03-27 02:09:00,610,buddy on the right was casting way above the bridge when the warden took his buddies away to give them a ticket and every cast he looked over his shoulder to see if warden was looking and casted as far upstream as he could..ti told him what the F are you doing you will get one to .. he then threatened me and told me to keep my fing mouth shut .. i said now cupcake dont let the walk over here stop you from coming over here. some people are just plain dicks.... from talking to a guy on the river that knows this group also says they do fish walley quite a bit  if you know what i mean so keep a eye out for truck and guys
