775029,DoubleDigits,2013-03-21 19:58:00,140,"Hi everyone, I thought I'd put up some fishing pictures from this winter. I've had a lot of fun fishing over the past 3 months...multiple days out on simcoe, a couple missions to BOQ, a weekend trip to Haliburton, and a week of bass fishing with my parents in Central Florida. The highlight for me was spending an afternoon teaching my mom to bass fish, and catching my biggest bass in the process. Enjoy:                       Thanks for looking, Brad  "

775091,NAW,2013-03-22 00:06:00,4022,"Nice shots man.  Those bass are hogs!  But more importantly, is that ean early ice whittie from Simcoe?  Not to many of those hoisted this year.  I fished that exact spot many times this year and was skunked on them...."
