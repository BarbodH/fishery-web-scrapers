It has nothing to do with how much work someone thinks they did.

I'm well aware not all of you live in Toronto...something tells me ""Randy from Sturgeon"" is one such individual.  I'm unclear in what way a unionized job is not a ""real job""...please explain.  You also pay for the ""bells and whistles"" that a Toyota Tacoma has over a Ford Ranger...that's because the Tacoma is a way better truck than the Ranger and it is more desirable to most people.  Just like trucks...not all jobs are created equal.  In my case I pay about 1% of my income in union dues but make around a third more money than I would if I did the same job for a non-union company.  I'm not ""paying for"" anything."

That you would attempt to argue against such a statement indicates you either work for Ford or haven't shopped for a truck in the last ten years.  Anyone who has done so is reading this right now and nodding their head.  Perhaps next you'd like to take issue with my ascertation that G Loomis generally makes better rods than Zebco."

All that said...I'm well aware I'm way better off with my union (just about any union) than I would be if I didn't belong to one.  The company I work for would like nothing more than to roll back a lot of what they are currently obligated to give us.  People talk about how unions ""back in the day"" fought for and established a lot of the rights we enjoy as working people today.  Then someone is always eager to say something like, ""Yeah, but unions have outlived their usefulness.""  They don't realize that unions are currently engaged in the struggle to simply maintain what many now take for granted.  If you think laws can't be repealed and that the people who run the companies we work for aren't trying to make that happen right now, you may be in for a big surprise one day when you show up for work and are told ""There's no such thing as OT or paid vacation anymore."""

The issue here is that less skilled workers thought that it would be a good idea to go union. If you can be replaced in a week with your job skills, then no, a union is not where you want to be. My union has nothing to do with protecting my rights. I can do that myself. It is all about being paid fairly, enjoying an excellent benefit package, getting negotiated wage increases, and looking forward to collecting my pensions (yes, I have two pensions.

776242,Live2fish85,2013-03-29 12:34:00,1633, Sorry the teachers have had everything handed to them by the liberals. No way they should be allowed to back sick days as extra pay.  They should be entitled to what they had banked as it was the way before but I don't disagree with what was done to them.

Vacation pay is mandatory as are stat holidays for those workers that qualify.  That stuff is guaranteed under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario...union or not, that's how it is for all working people in the province.  Learn your rights and call the MOL if you're getting screwed.  No union I've ever been represented by has negotiated for a Christmas party or bonus...that's up to your employer.  It sounds like (in your case) the union is ""useful"" in that you still have a job, because the company you work for is clearly desperate to implement cost-cutting measures."

What has happenened is complacency in the labour force""Let them eat cake"" The value of our labour is still exploited by the 1% and will be continued to be until we get angry enough once again to tear down the upper class.

776270,landry,2013-03-29 15:52:00,1005,"Here is a great article for you to think about. We need to be careful where we head with our precious health care And education in Canada - a country where a poor immigrant child can actually live the Canadian(American) dream:    By Mark Bulgutch and Peter Mansbridge  Anyone familiar with my educational background will know that my relationship with teachers was cool. Not cool as in hip and trendy. But cool as in frigid and icy. The fact that I didn't finish high school is my fault. I had teachers who tried to get through to me. Mr. Bank, Ms. Bruce and Mr. Westinghouse were among those who tried, oh how they tried.  But some challenges, like me, were just too much.  I put that on the record to make it clear that although a lot of people trace their success to a teacher who provided a spark, I don't. Still, I cringe when I hear and read all the teacher-bashing that's out there. I live in Ontario where the provincial government and the teacher unions have been locked in serious battle for several months. I'm not taking sides in the dispute. Not at all.  But my goodness, the things some people say about teachers. Based on what I hear on radio talk shows, and comments on the internet, there are way too many people who truly believe that teachers are grossly overpaid and under-worked.  What a strange attitude. Never mind that teachers are grooming the next generation of Canadians, the ones who will grow up to support our pensions in our old age. Maybe we can't think big-picture. The little-picture is pretty simple. Teachers are grooming our children. Yours and mine. Do we really want to trust the most precious parts of our lives to underpaid and overworked drones?  I keep seeing comparisons to what teachers make to the average industrial wage. And guess what? Teachers make more than the average. Of course they do. They've gone to school for at least four years of post-secondary education. The average teacher has been working for 11 years. They should be making reasonably good money. They're raising families too.  Then there's the under-worked part. That argument usually starts with July and August. Teachers get the whole summer off. No doubt about it; that's nice. But they need the break. I know there are lazy teachers. Just as there are lazy bankers, letter carriers, doctors, and yes, lazy journalists. But overwhelmingly, teachers are not lazy. In Ontario, the teachers stopped participating in extracurricular activities as part of their fight with the government. What an uproar that caused. School plays, sports teams, newspapers, chess clubs, fashion shows, and on and on. None of them possible without teachers freely giving their time. Critics are anxious to count the summer against the teachers, but they never count all those extra hours in their favour.  And sure, classes go from about 9am to 330pm, but anyone who thinks a teacher works six and a half hours a day, doesn't know many teachers. Preparing for class takes time. Talking to kids after school takes time. Meeting with parents takes time. Marking takes time. I can't imagine reading through 60 essays on why Hamlet is so sad and writing helpful comments in the margins.  We send teachers children from broken homes, from abusive homes, from negligent homes. We send teachers children from homes where both parents work, or where the only parent works, or where no parent works.  We send teachers children who leave home without breakfast and whose grasp of mathematics is grounded in the reality that welfare money sometimes runs out in 28 days or 29 days, and can't be stretched to cover 30 or 31.  We send teachers children who are new to Canada, children who stare blankly ahead unable to understand a single word that is being spoken.  And we ask that those teachers turn each of those children, each of our children, into productive little citizens. We ask that even though there are 28 or 29 other students in the classroom, even though there are students misbehaving, even though some parents don't support teachers by re-enforcing lessons or by making sure homework is done, or even by insisting that the student listen to or respect the teacher.  So argue the fine points of teacher contracts all you like. I'm not saying teacher unions are always right. I'm just saying running down teachers is wrong."

Also there are lots of non-union shops that pay their workers union level wages and give them everything they'd likely get through CB...they don't do so out of the goodness of their hearts...they do so because the want to avoid having their workers exercise the option of organizing.

To me, at first glance, it kind of makes sense to hire more people and have them work something closer the normally accepted 40 hour week.  Admittedly, I really don't know anything about what you do...but I know how I feel after working just two or three 60 hour weeks in a row.  Eventually my work (let alone life) begins to suffer.  I don't blame your employer for wanting to move in that direction or your union for not preventing it.  Are there really no non-unionized jobs available in your field?...or are there no non-unionized jobs available in your field that you want?  Just like you could get a job as a parts-man but don't want it...there are other options available to you, they're just not very attractive.  You seem to want all the benefits that go with having a union job...without the union.  Those gigs are tough to find, Brother.  There are a lot more non-unionized jobs than unionized ones...plus there's the option of self-employment.

776149,Rich,2013-03-28 23:01:00,3927,"""Food Safety Violation""  Richard was witnessed without a hairnet on in the dept.  Three steps inside the dept, and I only WENT in the prep area to put a hairnet on!!"

776165,irishfield,2013-03-28 23:39:00,26272," and when you ""did"".. did you add ""are you  happy now?""    I got three days once , from Consumers Glass in Milton, thanks to one of the line girls telling the packing room foreman to.. well you know.. on my behalf while I faught to get an overflowing moosehead beer bottle inspection line running. He thought I'd yelled it at him over the bottle jingle noise... so I got 3 days for insubordination. Worked out great. It was Tuesday so I took Wed/Thur/Friday with my Saturday to Wednesday @ noon once a month weekend and spent 7 days in the streams from the Forks of the Credit to GBay. Then came back, grieved it with the gal admitting to MY foreman that she told the packing room foreman off and not me and I got all my wages back and had a great week fishing. I bet you went fishing that day too Rick..... now go over your steward. If the union had any use, the manager in question wouldn't be cutting meat. That said... that week of fishing was the last use I ever had for a union and my loss of 5% a week on GROSS wages!"

Every member  when meeting with management should have a rep with them. We have meetings every week and failure to represent comes up quite often some times the executive members may not agree with the member but we must follow there wishes even if we know its a lost cause
