775844,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-27 04:20:00,8243,"Thanks for sharing, much of what you do like volunteering your time and experience sure sounds admirable but certainly doesn't fall under any definition of mental instability. I have heard there was some type of angling for something called a trout this time of year, am going to give it a shot. Haven't fished for trout for over 25 years and decided after todays breath of something called spring am going to give it a shot this week after I check the regs. Haven't seen anyone out on the Grand River where the usual suspects are or at any of the dams so checking the regs  tonight will be a good start. Thanks all you Trout hunters for getting me off my Arse, can't even find a driving range open so a fishing I will go.  Johnny D  Off topic but thought I would share, Dear wife asked this past Sunday  it she could borrow 8 lures to mount in a shadow box and display, great Idea so I picked out 8, I never use, guess what a few were? You got it trout spoons and a Flatfish........the lures framed and under glass looks really cool. Is the word "" cool "" still used today?"

774455,livinisfishin,2013-03-19 00:33:00,661,"This year i got out ice fishing a lot more then I normally do, so that killed some of the frustration of not being able to cast . I also spent quite a bit of time at the gym and that was a good way to beat yhe boredom. Now that spring is getting closer I will be pulling out the  softwater gear and preparing for a good season where i may actually hook into some fish unlike this winter."
774458,danc,2013-03-19 00:48:00,4677,"I keep busy enough with my job to not have to think about the open water season. I've been working away from home since the new year and of course have been doing lots of travelling. Most of my work has been in Terrace Bay, but I'm in Red Lake for a few weeks now. The open water will get here sooner or later."
774619,capt_hooked,2013-03-19 22:36:00,212,Musky fish...!
774620,capt_hooked,2013-03-19 22:38:00,212,Thanks Lew...!
774647,camillj,2013-03-20 00:26:00,1988,Two words ... google earth ... never before have you  ever been able to 'fly' the area .. look for tribs you didnt know about ... see the real lay of the land in 3D and look for features on land and lakeshore that could hold a clue ... and see hidden back lakes mere meters away from your 'haunting grounds' that you never saw before ... and it just aint the same looking at maps as it is flying the terrian like a video game .... my new 'off-season' pass-time
774661,Sinker,2013-03-20 01:21:00,8692,What opener are you guys talking about anyways? Season is ALWAYS open for something!!  The only time I don't fish is when hunting season is open
774691,mcdougy,2013-03-20 02:44:00,274,I agree
774692,kickingfrog,2013-03-20 02:48:00,8333,I watch people do crazy things on the interweb.

774926,nexstar,2013-03-21 04:03:00,63,just watch wfn & youtube fishing videos all winter long ..
774961,cityfisher,2013-03-21 14:03:00,959, +1 lol Only differance is I gave up on hockey years ago. This time of year is the worst!!!!! snow and ice melt asap please!

775060,Steve,2013-03-21 22:25:00,2075,"insane how many anglers don't fish our year 'round opportunities.  bass ""only"" fisherman are the hardest to understand. Half june, july, august, and september (most end at thanksgiving weekend). well less than half the year for fishing.  lets enjoy what nature has to offer ..."
775068,lew,2013-03-21 22:38:00,12766," There's lots more to life than fishing Steve and many folks, me included, think staring at a hole in the ice is about as exciting as 5 pin bowling."
775070,Steve,2013-03-21 22:52:00,2075,"i agree. actually, i'd go five pin bowling before ice fishing.  but casting from a boat in december/january/february/march or a pier in the same months - something special to be said for that.  work is just as crazy in january as it is in july.  therefore a release from work though fishing is just as enjoyable in january as it is in july."

773942,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-16 02:41:00,8243,"I have been known to do some nut job obsessive compulsive disorder type of things waiting for opening of walleye and Bass. Polished, paint touch up, clean eyes, painted on eyes, added eyelashes, sharpen hooks, tune eyes, put in order or colour spectrum, weight, size, trimmed hair, added hair, colored hair, added flake, trimmed tails, tied and dropped into bathtub to gauge fall rate and action, added stingers, painted on stripes and polka dots. That's just my tube jigs.  Craziest and most productive was to tie a line to my Terriers collar throw a ball and test line and drag,,,, in the living room!  What about you folks? How do you pass the time without losing it?"
773947,Christopheraaron,2013-03-16 02:52:00,3525,"I fish pike, crappie and perch! LOL"
773950,Handlebarz,2013-03-16 03:24:00,3790,I used to sharpen hooks all winter. But a few years ago one of our members convinced me to start selling my lures so now all free time is spent building musky lures. I must say its s good way to keep my mind off fishing NOT. With each one I build I wonder who will get it and what will they catch?  Thus spring I do plan on pike fishing and walleye by may

773973,Rod Caster,2013-03-16 12:14:00,5784,added eyelashes? I hope you were still talking about the lures  I've done the line test with the cat before.
773977,lew,2013-03-16 12:27:00,12766,"Muskies are the only species I target and once the season closes mid-December, so does my interest in fishing. I occupy my time with other interests during the winter and get back into fishing mode when the season re-opens in early June.  My gear is always in good shape before it goes into hibernation and when spring arrives, everything, including me, is ready for the soft water.  I have zero interest in ice fishing and even though I visit this & many other fishing sites thru the cold months, I seldom if ever read the ice fishing reports.  Really enjoy alot of the NF topics though"
773989,jedimaster,2013-03-16 13:58:00,3472,"Hockey and ice fishing season is over lapped and followed by crappie, then turkey hunting, then trout, then walleye, then bass and musky, then deer hunting, then ice fishing.... repeat. Fortunately there Is only a small gap between ice season and crapoie. That is filled with hockey warching and fishing toy playing."
773990,BillM,2013-03-16 14:02:00,17367,"Always something to fishing for, lakers, whities, steelhead, etc etc etc.."
774003,Moosebunk,2013-03-16 14:29:00,3970,"Between ice season and opener I used to have about a month.  In that time I'd flip the WarCanoe and go over it with a fine tooth comb.  Sanding, fiberglassing, painting, motor maintenance.  I'd sort all the camp gear, tackle, rods, put in a LeBaron's order with the income tax return.  Make some lures & jigs too.  Now I try and do that, plus fish a couple days a week for trout, crappie and gar.  This spring there's some work to be done on the WarCanoe again, the small motors, the tackle, some trip planning, and as well as some simple wiring for a new sonar.  Fishing is a full-time job 365 days a year. lol."
774004,GBW,2013-03-16 14:38:00,8460,right now I'm cleaning up all my lures that are in different trays due to ice fishing and not being put back in the fall.  this way I know where it all is and if I need to go buy the odd item to replace a lure or just hooks.  So I will be ready for what ever when ever.  that and going to tie up some flies later today too.
774006,Locnar,2013-03-16 14:50:00,645,I've organized my tackle and set-up my rods. Now I'm just waiting for the suckers to roll into town. Maybe I'll try for some pike as well.
774021,Steve,2013-03-16 15:55:00,2075,i go fishing.  there isn't a month of the year that in Ontario you can't go fishing  ....  and I don't mean ice fishing.
774065,porkpie,2013-03-16 20:19:00,2521,"I fish for steelhead, pickerel, crappie and perch and salmon only when I need bait, and not if I can get a bunch of skeins from open water trolling buddies.  The pickerel are a once a year annual trip, and occasional ice fishing trip, and the perch and crappie are occasional distractions, either through the ice or in the spring if nothing else is going on.  I havent ice fished in 2 years now, and cant say i miss it that much!  Outside of that, I enjoy targeting steelhead, but I no longer looking forward to catching spawned out tired bows on opener.  I prefer to catch them in the colder months of spring if possible, and in the fall.  Otherwise I do a bit of hunting here and there.  At this point I just enjoy the seasons as they come up, I don't sit in my basement polishing tackle or the like!"
774114,dhickey,2013-03-17 01:05:00,1038,I work like crazy then shop(like I need more stuff) Play with the gear tuning it up. Then before I know it its over weather it be soft or hard water.. Keeps me out of troble.. I also never take off my camo hat.When Im working Im thinking about fishing Year round..But work does get in the way all to often.  That my friend is obsesive compulsive but My kids love it too. And Im ok with it.  When my hands smell like fresh fish and the smiles are huge then Im a happy man...  Saltydawg.

I used to have to find ways to pass the time before fishing opens but now getting the boats and gear ready, it is here before I know it.  Still get excited like I did 20 years ago for the opener!"
