Here I sit on a Saturday night, watching for the Easter Bunny, watching my dear wife watching TV, watching the cat watch me watching my wife watching TV, and me watching a video watching a guy not catch fish. Oh my. I miss the discos, and my fishing. If the stores were open tomorrow I'd be in line to buy a new boat battery. I need some professional help, soon, and a battery."

Wish it was 2008.... a most productive year fishing wise for me"
