775894,BITEME,2013-03-27 15:11:00,1968,Yeah I was told you needed one when i went I think it was $22 you know what the sad part is if your a resident you pay like 30 or 40 for life.......hey MNR are you listening
775897,ccmtcanada,2013-03-27 15:44:00,7971, Check out this link...http://myfwc.com/license/recreational/visitors/  There are different licenses for fresh and salt water...shore and pier etc....  Hope this helps.
775898,BillM,2013-03-27 16:01:00,17367, You'll need a license.
775899,bare foot wader,2013-03-27 16:03:00,1354,"the $22 licence is the 3 day salt, you can do it with your credit card over the phone, best to do it in advance, the line can get busy if you call at 6 am on a saturday...especially during peak season  you are assigned a Florida angler number which is good for life...and then another number for your 3 day salt licence  very quick and easy to do, you need to keep your ID on you at all times and present the officer with your angler and licence numbers"
