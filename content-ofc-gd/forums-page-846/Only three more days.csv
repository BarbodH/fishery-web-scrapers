342652,Big Cliff,2009-05-18 19:30:00,6899,"Well, to say I'm excited would be an understatement, I've even been practicing not sleeping all night just so I get it right on Thursday. Friday morning; John, Barb, and I are meeting up for breakfast and then we are heading down to spend a weekend with Marc Thorp (Who wouldn't be excited?). Getting a chance to fish with John again, getting to finally meet Barb, add that to a weekend of fishing with Marc, and top it off with a chance to see Roy and J again...... well, I feel like a five year old waiting for Christmas morning to get here.  My body may be 63 years old but my brain still hasn't caught up with it yet (oh wait, maybe I'm in my second childhood??????) WHO CARES!"
342654,Terry,2009-05-18 19:41:00,14456,sounds like it's going to be a great time

342673,John,2009-05-18 20:42:00,2956,We're really pumped for it too Cliff. Worst part is I have to work 3 days before we head out. Looking forward to fishing again with you too. Barbara promised to have us at the Fifth Wheel by 7.00am Friday morn'. I am excited about trying Marc's method for Walleye and Sauger.  See you soon Bud.
