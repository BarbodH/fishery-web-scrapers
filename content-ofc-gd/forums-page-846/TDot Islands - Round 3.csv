Swpet my usual areas with both lures which have worked for my last two times I went (5 pike the first times, 3 pike the second time).  Pike gone for the summer?  Also, I was surprised that the catfish took a chomp at my xrap. "

343250,MSBruno,2009-05-20 14:49:00,369, I started working those deeper spots too.  I'm ging to focus on those spots entirely next time.
