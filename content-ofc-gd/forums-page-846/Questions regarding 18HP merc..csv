When I have the top piece off, I can see a gasket or seal or something, (a rubber ring) thats out of place. I guess the best way to describe it would be to show you !     Here is an example of the amount of play in the piece     Does anyone know why there is a rubber seal there ? Is this a big problem or no ? I know that when I go to snap down the top piece, its a little lose aswell !  Thanks !"
