343589,Weekend Warrior,2009-05-21 15:48:00,27,"I was just hoping to get a bit of direction from anyone that has experience on these lakes.  I was looking to do some walleye and pike fishing this weekend and was interested in checking out Moira or Crowe lake. I have fished both for bass but I don't know what either is like for these species. I was wondering which of the two people would recommend. I normally fish rice but I was hoping to check out a lake with pike as well.  Any recommendations of another kawartha-area lake with pike and walleye would be great as well. I fish a pretty small boat, so places like BOQ are out of the question.  I'm not looking to blow any top secret locations, so hopefully this doesn't get derailed  Any help is appreciated!"
