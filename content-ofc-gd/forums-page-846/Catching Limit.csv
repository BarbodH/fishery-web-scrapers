342411,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-17 17:11:00,0,  For most fish species it isn't possible to have 4 lb of fillets with the limits and size restrictions already imposed other than Trout and Salmon. Not to mention. What type of fish are you referring to? I limit myself. lol. I fish for all species. So when I am out for one I like to eat. You can bet a limit is coming home with me....
342467,love2fishhave2work,2009-05-17 22:26:00,212," I don't know about the rest of you but I have only been able to manage my multi species limit of everything that swims in Ontario 4  out of 9 times that i tried.  Went through 3 knives trying to fillet everything. each time.  Broke my dang freezer but I got them all in there.  If anyone wants a fish fry, give me a buzz."
342496,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-18 00:58:00,835,"Truth is people don't like to clean fish, thats the real reason C+R is so popular, I don't think you have much to worry about as the # of people that would clean that many fish would be counted on your fingers.."
342549,outllaw,2009-05-18 10:57:00,1232,i just want to ask. wheres the batter mmmm. fresh fillets
342560,Handlebarz,2009-05-18 12:27:00,3790,Well I know that this summer when out on lake Erie if I am lucky enough to get a limit of eyes and bows they will all come home with me to go to Dads Freezer I will do it again if I can and send that over to a old friend who does not get out much since his wife went def I don't eat fish but do help out people who love it but don't get out much or at all. I also know people who will go out get the limit of eyes then there 50 jumbos head home clean them and do the same the next day they will gift the fish to there family then get there limit this is usually it for the season so is it wrong to get your seasons of fish in two days?
343042,fishermccann,2009-05-19 23:35:00,655,"Do not say on this site that you are willfully breaking the law with your 12 fish, because your friend catches so many more , you are a POACHER- and nothing else!!...."
343145,brifishrgy,2009-05-20 07:32:00,559,"  before YOU call someone a poacher you might want to re read his post  Quote from his post  ""Again a hypothetical scenario for demonstrations only."""
343178,Headhunter,2009-05-20 12:39:00,5703,"I don't believe anglers can deplete a fish stock. Commercial netting and netting by ""others"" will deplete stocks. I think the real issue should be finding a way to get the ""general"" population to stop supporting these netting tactics, by not buying the fish. HH"
343182,holdfast,2009-05-20 12:58:00,1813," Nice Theory, your friend then left more Cow for me to eat because all he does is eat Fish.  Fact is there is absolutely no reason one person should keep 50 perch for one fishing outing.  How about one outing one meal.   Say six perch, one Bass, one Pike,  Six sunfish , 2 Pickerel.  Some of these Quotas sound like commercial fishing Regulations that sustain a livelihood or a Band/Clan/Town."
343200,Spiel,2009-05-20 13:27:00,9065, Depending on the size of the perch it can take upwards of 50 to feed my clan of fish lovers.
343211,mepps,2009-05-20 13:52:00,1301,"I always wondered that...  Heres an even strange one, in New Brunswick your daily limit for muskie is 10!  and it must be between 10cm and 170cm!! (thats 66 inches!)  http://www.gnb.ca/0254/StJohnUpper-BurbotMuskellunge-e.asp"
343233,kickingfrog,2009-05-20 14:31:00,8333,"  If that was related to my post, that was part of my point.  The poacher, who as I stated is breaking the law, is impacting the fishery less than the angler who is not breaking the law.  Right, legal and ethical are not always the same thing.  These are exactly the type of things that need to be discussed here and in the offices where decisions are made.  Here's another scenario:  I catch 1 walleye that is 1cm into the slot that says it can't be kept. I keep it, it is the only fish that I keep. Poacher  My friend keeps his limit of 4 walleye that are half a cm smaller (or bigger) than the slot. Completely within the law.  Again the poacher has probably had less of a negative impact on the fishery.  Anybody have a headache yet?  My ultimate point is someone can be completely within the law, and feel quite self righteous, and still have a harmful impact on a fishery. Which, I think, was the point of the original post  As people who use a delicate resource, we need to go beyond the posted regulations sometimes if we want to continue to enjoy our recreation."
343242,kickingfrog,2009-05-20 14:37:00,8333,"  Ha Ha. More cow for you? You haven't seen my friends surf 'n' turf ""plate breakers specials"". Or how big he is.   I think the one outing one meal idea has some merit, in theory, but I'm sure the politicos would be unwilling to discuss it."
343255,bigugli,2009-05-20 15:07:00,6138," Here at home, 10 perch is dinner for 2, 20 dinner for 4.  If we have a big family dinner, 50  8-10"" perch are gone in no time. Mind we have 4 licensed anglers here.   As for someone keeping 2 walleye a week/ 100 a year. Many of us were raised on fishing and hunting as a way of life. We eat fish 2-3 days a week. It has always been part of the diet. there is the sporting element to fishing, but I often take some home for table. It's meat. No different than harvesting a deer and a bear for the freezer when i still hunted."
343265,pike slayer,2009-05-20 15:40:00,1177,"i feel there are less and less anglers out there. the prices of everything is going up and its turning into a rich mans sport. for instance last year rapalas were around $7 and they are now $10 this year. buying a boat and motor isnt cheap either and plus gas getting to the lake. i find more of the old timers are the ones not paying attention to the regs cause things were different back in their day. Most new anglers are now obeying the laws. i feel if you want better fish populations then they should close townships or areas for a year then reopen them and close a different one. it would kinda suck for ppl with camps on these closed lakes but to bad. i feel the limits are low as is, i'm with dara on this one with the laws in southern ontario compared to here. Also i cant stand slot sizes on fish especially pike! who in the right mind would keep 4 pike under 24'? i feel that fish is a waste cause of the amount of meat you get off it and yes i know how to fillet them well so i only keep pike above 24"" go for it call me a poacher i don't care. i pretty well feel that things are fine for right now but that lowering of lake trout limits! i'll no longer go for lakers and i will be targetting over species instead having more of an impact on them."
343399,holdfast,2009-05-20 22:27:00,1813," AHA, you and your Clan of Buddies have been eating FisH Lake to a point that it is now a Collapsed Fishery.   You could of saved me roughly eight hours of fishing for nothing the last two weeknds.  Not even a signal on the Fish Finder.  YOU Horrible Horrible man."
342099,laszlo,2009-05-16 12:52:00,487,"This may be a touchy subject and I'm really not trying to stir the pot here. Over the last 15 years fish populations have reduced substantually. Yes, there are many factors for this but are people keeping too many fish???  In zone 16 of Ontario this could be had with a sporting liscense in one day:  Hit a Lake and keep - 4 Walleye 6 Bass 6 Pike 1 Muskey 50 Perch 30 Crappie 50 Sunfish 2 Lake Trout 12 Whitefish and so on.........  Same day hit a river and keep - 5 Brook Trout 5 Brown Trout 2 Rainbow Trout and so on.........  Well that would be an amazing day of fishing and realisticly would never happen but, just that fact that the law makes this a possibility, does seem suspect. The good thing is that a large percentage of fisherman are conservationist.  This all comes down to one question.  Who believes that fish limits should be further reduced from the current limits?"
342109,Greencoachdog,2009-05-16 13:12:00,8163,"I think having a slot or size limit for each species would be a better idea, keeping the prime breeders in the system is a must!!!"
342113,Spiel,2009-05-16 13:30:00,9065,"Well not exactly, with trout/salmon you are allowed a combined limit of 5 per day/possesion. In most cases no more than 2 may be lake trout."
342114,Marko,2009-05-16 13:32:00,854,Imagine having to clean and fillet 50 Perch or 50 sunfish....that`d be just awful.
342120,timmeh,2009-05-16 13:50:00,609, I certainly agree with this. Selective harvest is key to maintaining healthy fish populations. But personally i wouldn't mind seeing a few of those numbers lowered.
342121,Terry,2009-05-16 13:53:00,14456,"in many cases the fishing has never been better in my life time  the limits are somewhat based on the health of the fishery besides, if you are catching that many different fish everyday, you clearly don't have a job, so it might be the only food you get each day for you family"
342123,outllaw,2009-05-16 13:56:00,1232,zone 19 is 6 walleyes. keep em yessir. commercial netting -99.06 percent sportfishing 0.04 per-cent. so as you can see its a lopsided affair.
342126,kickingfrog,2009-05-16 14:13:00,8333,"Right, legal and ethic are not always the same thing.  I'll throw hypothetical situation out there:  I go walleye fishing once a year to a lake/zone that has a 4 fish daily limit and 8 possession. I fish three days. I catch and keep 4 fish, 4 fish and 4 fish. I don't eat any of the 12 fish and bring them home to eat over the next several months. I am breaking the law by being over my possession limit. My friend who lives on the lake fishes every weekend (the lucky sod) and keeps 2 fish every time and eats them right away, over 100 fish during the season. Totally legal.  He's legal, I'm not. Who made less of an impact on the fish stock? Are my ethics ""better"" than his? Who is right?  Another situation:  My mother only goes out once with me during my three days of fishing and keeps 5 walleye (she still can out fish me) to take home.  Total fish removed from the system: Mom 5 -braking the law Me 12 - breaking the law My friend 100 plus - legal  Again a hypothetical scenario for demonstrations only."
342127,danbouck,2009-05-16 14:15:00,4380,that would be one nice lake!
342128,bigugli,2009-05-16 14:23:00,6138,"Are you suggesting only 1 species per day should be harvested?  The limits per species are fine. There are additional limits on size as well with over/under rules for pike and walleye.  Truth is fishing has improved substantially since the late 70's in all the areas I fish. Species  distribution has change in some areas, and I've learnt to target the more prevalent species as well. Who would dare to admit to fishing carp or catfish back in the 70's? No one."
342131,laszlo,2009-05-16 14:46:00,487, this is exactly what i'm suggesting with also maybe reducing the limit 'slightly'. human population continues to grow meaning more and more fisherman.  seems logical to me.
342145,bigugli,2009-05-16 15:28:00,6138,How about limiting the human population instead. Seems even more logical. Hypothetically.

342149,laszlo,2009-05-16 15:45:00,487, yes! nobody wants to say it but it's so true.
342151,BillM,2009-05-16 15:47:00,17367," That doesn't seem very logical.  Even if the population was decreased, do that mean fishing would be any less popular?  The limits that are currently in place suck, no one needs 5 bows out of Lake Ontario in a single day."
342155,bigugli,2009-05-16 15:58:00,6138," No different than 'managing' populations of game and livestock through controlled hunts or culling. Thereby keeping the human populace within a comfortable margin for the food supply.  A little Malthus, a little Orwell, a little ""Logans Run"", and for good measure, some ""Soylent Green"". Unpleasant, unpalatable and unpopular, but hypothetically possible."

342169,hammercarp,2009-05-16 16:22:00,964,"The number of licenced anglers in Ontario has been decreasing for a number of years. So Bigugli, regarding angling, in effect there is a lower human population  or what this could mean is that fewer people are obeying the laws in the first place. So catch limits and slots limits don't mean bubkiss to someone who is fishing illegally to begin with. Kickingfrog the answer to your dilemma is that many times more anglers can visit a lake than live on it. I think angling laws are already complicated enough. Making laws that are a pile of spagetti is not good.  People will refuse to follow them if they are a headache to decipher or they will quit fishing altogether. Either way is not good. I think Bigugli has the answer fish for a variety of fish. One of the reasons I promote carp fishing is the take the pressure off of the most targeted species."
342171,bigugli,2009-05-16 16:52:00,6138,"The idea of population control for the human species is just a simplistic, yet logical, hypothesis. Not to be taken seriously. Same with quick fix solutions of reducing limits or increasing fines. there aren't enough CO's around to effectively enforce current laws. What is needed is proactive resource management. Something the average taxpayer does not want to pay for in Ontario. As long as we destroy spawning areas and habitat, pollute, develop wetland, dam rivers, drain down lakes for our consumption, the fishery suffers. Reduced limits are not going to make up for the damage being done. Increased hatchery outputs might help, but that, too, is just a bandaid approach. Habitat protection and rehabilitation, and spawning ground protection, will achieve superior results. Ensuring that a company like EB Eddy can never again wipe out a fishery with another chemical spill.  Stop the development of wetlands. Reduced speed limits in prime shallow water breeding areas.  These are proactive ways to help the fishery, but they are expensive."

We have to put up with enough of your goofy overpopulated southern Ontario laws already. The people I know that go fishing 3 or 3 times a week and catch a few fish for a meal, go to lakes that will support the pressure. If they won't, they go to a different lake. Don't make laws based on your fishing pressure for us to follow. Please don't give that stupid government any more good ideas. Wait..I got one...how bout you have to register all the fish you catch and pay a new tax on them. A dollar for each fish caught and kept, 2 dollars for each  released fish."
342388,laszlo,2009-05-17 15:49:00,487, i believe this is why ontario has different limits and regulations for different zones. i'm referring specificly to my zone not all of ontario. lots of fish north of the french.
