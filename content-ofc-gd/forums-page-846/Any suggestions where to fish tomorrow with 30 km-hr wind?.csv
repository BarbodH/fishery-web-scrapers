343018,jediangler,2009-05-19 23:00:00,1923,I always gravitate towards smaller conservation area lakes when the wind blows over 30km/h. Find one with a launch in the northeast end of the lake as the wind will be blowing from the southwest. You can fight the wind early then blow back to the launch at the end of your day.

I haven't been out since the season opened, the weather has been pretty terrible at times."
