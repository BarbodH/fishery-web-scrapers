Usualy I write the post first and pictures after.. but we all like pictures.. so here they are first:      Fished 3 times since the opener, and have been catching every time. Fishing with different friends each time, different conditions but I cannot complain so far.  I even had a chance to go up north and catch some Landlocks, which has become my new favourite species!   They are picky fish I have to say and not the easiest thing to get, but once they hit, man are they rewarding, great fighters!    Anyway just wanted to share some pictures."
