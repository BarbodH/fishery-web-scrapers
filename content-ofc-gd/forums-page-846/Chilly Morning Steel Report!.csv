I'll keep the report short cause im too lazy/tired to type anything extra.  Haven't fished a chilly morning for a while...my fingers were quite numb for the first half hour or so until I hooked into the first fish . My buddy went 2/3 and I went 5/8 this morning..which is quite incredible since its already mid May! All fish were found in 4-5ft deep holes, I guess they were absorbing the heat from the sun. My buddy and I both lost several good size (pushing 12lbs) fish into logjams. The ones we landed were ranged from 3-5lbs, nothing crazy.   here are a few pictures..           Hey MJL, so WHEN are we going to go for a drift?! or your too busy fishing for carp."

You know I'm working through an addiction to chrome  Young grasshopper, I must show you the ways of the jedi carping force (Being a carping Jedi master myself   )... Only when you become a master of carp (the world's smartest freshwater fish), can you truly become a master angler of all other species."
