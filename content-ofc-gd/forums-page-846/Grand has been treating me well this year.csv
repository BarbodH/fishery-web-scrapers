343006,Marko,2009-05-19 22:31:00,854,"Decided to hit Desjardanis on long weekend ( Monday) what a mistake that was. Got there and i was actually excited to give it another go. Last time i went, I got my ass handed to me by those carp. Lost who knows how many in snags and break offs but hey its all part of fishing. Got there around 11 and it was packed. Seems like everyone who was there brought their kids out to fish with them, which there is nothing wrong with, but i don't think that's the place where you want to teach your 10 year old to fish. Watched some people fish for few minutes, noticed few 10 foot stringers floating around with who knows how many carp around and that's when it hit me that i made a mistake lol. Anyways people were casting across each other lines and nobody would pull their lines out if you had a fish on it was a mess. Decided to stay for few hours anyways, had to scoot bellow the bridge. Manage to land 3 and lost few of them, even more people showed up and decided it was time for me to go. Drove home to a spot 10 minutes from my place and these were the results. First one of two 26 inchers   This guy had some nice scales, never seen them like this    Somewhat of a close up pic of the same fish    Managed few more    This one was a fatty    Few more      And last but not the least, nice smally came out to play    Lost two or three probably about the same size.  All in all a great day, kinda bummed to see what went on in Hamilton but hey, when CO wont go around to these places not much i can really do. All fish were caught on fat worms, they would not touch my corn for some reason but hey..  hope you guys enjoy the report"

343019,Marko,2009-05-19 23:01:00,854,"haha all fish were released lol. That was for my braid, dentist work is quite expensive lol"
343020,jediangler,2009-05-19 23:02:00,1923,"I'm no carp expert Marko, but that one with the funny scales might be a mirror carp or maybe a mirror/common cross."
343021,Joeytier,2009-05-19 23:02:00,3990,I was thinking it had more to do with inconsiderate fisherman...
343022,Marko,2009-05-19 23:05:00,854, Inconsiderate? There was nobody around me for miles
343043,Leecher,2009-05-19 23:36:00,7832,WOW... another great report I think you made the right decision to move closer to home.... Sweet reward for your efforts! Great looking carp!!! Congratulations  Marko Leechman
343082,Victor,2009-05-20 01:08:00,1609,"sounds like u had a decent day other than the part at desjardin...  we need to go hunt some bigger ones!  that's a nice looking carp, and yup, it looks like a mirror... geez, why haven't i caught one of those still."
343089,MJL,2009-05-20 01:17:00,2427,Great reports and pics Marko.  That fully scaled mirror is a gem...Beauty fish...Congrats  Looks like I might have a go at the carp around my local swims...You've got me pumped!
343163,bigugli,2009-05-20 12:05:00,6138,Congrats. You seemed to get into them pretty good there.  Well done.
343167,Greencoachdog,2009-05-20 12:17:00,8163,A real nice report Marko!!!  That fatty and the Mirror are darned fine specimens!!!
343173,limeyangler,2009-05-20 12:25:00,5204,"some nice carp there Marko, shame about the crowds.  That indeed looks like a mirror carp.  Thanks for posting"
343246,Marko,2009-05-20 14:44:00,854,"Thanks for the replies guys. I found a bit of a hole i guess, thanks to Victor, but they are in there. I thought mirror carp would not have scales all over their bodies, just maybe a patch here and there but thats good to know. Victor i left a few for you, you just have to get some worms haha."
343247,Joeytier,2009-05-20 14:47:00,3990,I misread.  My mistake.
343252,LeXXington,2009-05-20 14:50:00,1928,"Nice fishing,"
