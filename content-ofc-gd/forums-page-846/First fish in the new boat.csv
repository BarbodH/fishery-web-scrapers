No more tiller for me...Went out Monday for a pike day and the fish were on fire. My buddy and I caught more than 50 pike between 4 and 7 lbs. Boat ran well and the fishing was good.  "

343362,Lungelarry,2009-05-20 21:03:00,294,"GCD, the water is still cold so something that stays in their face alittle longer than usual is whats needed....husky jerks and weighted soft jerk baits  were the baits of choice..."
