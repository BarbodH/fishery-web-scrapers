My cousin called me up and someone told him that this is a good lake for Walleye..  I told him I would look into it with the OFC board members and get back to him.. Not sure about this lake.. Just don't want to drive up, get there and be totally blind..  Any help & tips would be greatly appreciated...  Tiz"
