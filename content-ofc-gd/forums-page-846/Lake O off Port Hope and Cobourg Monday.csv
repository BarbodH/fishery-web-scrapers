342875,Sharkbait22,2009-05-19 14:49:00,297,Went fishing yesterday with a friend 7-1pm.  Great weather. Fished 2 dipsys and 2 steel line setups 10-50 over 10-100 fow without a sniff. Flatlined the shallows.  Water 45-47 degrees F.  Still too early?  I plan on fishing Lake O frequently this summer. Any advice on timing and approach would be great.  Hopefully my reports will become more entertaining in the future.
