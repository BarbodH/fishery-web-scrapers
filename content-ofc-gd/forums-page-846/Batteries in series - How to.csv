342409,Terry,2009-05-17 17:06:00,14456,"you want them in  parallel ,positive to positive and negative  to negative  12 volts out  in  series it would be 24 volts  out, positive to negative"
342429,irishfield,2009-05-17 18:18:00,26272,"What Terry says..  Parallel.. is just that.. side by each ""in parallel"". = 12 volts no matter how many you hook together  Series.. end to end... ""in series"". = 12v time X... X being the number of batteries."
342442,Garnet,2009-05-17 19:03:00,2056,If you want the absolute longest run time run 1 then switch to the other. Be aware that running battery's dead is very hard on them.  If 1 of your battery's is a 1000 crank and the other is 850 they will equalize to the lower #. If one of your battery's has a dead cell both will be dead quickly.  When you hook battery's in parallel say 1000 crank you do not get   2000 you get about 2/3's so about 1500.  Garnet
342796,Glaucus,2009-05-19 04:21:00,48,"  Your information doesn’t agree with ‘Peukert's Law'  , (this is assuming both batteries are ‘matched’, i.e. the same size, age, state of charge, etc...) What am I missing? Could you please explain your advice!"
342817,Garnet,2009-05-19 11:06:00,2056,You answered your ?  Assuming  Assuming Peukert law  Assuming perfect world  You will get about 2/3's for me I would kill 1 battery then the next then the next.  Garnet
