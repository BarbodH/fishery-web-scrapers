343369,perodimi,2009-05-20 21:23:00,124,"I had some issues with my lawnmower at my trailer near Lindsay so I thought I'd stop by Cliff's to see if I could find the part I needed. Before I knew it, he took possession of it and gave 'er the once over top to bottom, scrounged for parts in the yard and it came out like brand new, all for a little more than a smile.  I can't find the words to describe the gratitude and respect I have for this man. He hardly knows me yet he bent over backwards to help out and asked for nothing in return. This twisted world we live in would be a much better place if everyone had a little bit of ""BigCliff"" in their hearts.  Hats off to you Cliff and I hope you have wonderful time this weekend!  Peter"

343376,ecmilley,2009-05-20 21:36:00,2163,"cliff always helps out, just remember he will accept beer as payment, pc pilsner I believe"
343377,perodimi,2009-05-20 21:38:00,124,"Ahh, the truth comes out! He claimed he wasn't much of a drinker so I got him a CTC gift card instead!"
343382,Big Cliff,2009-05-20 21:58:00,6899,"Well a cold PC Pilsner on a hot day would go down OK, I think I might have had 5 or 6 last summer (OK, OK, might have been 8 or 10 LOL) All I know is I bought a 24 and ended up giving about 1/2 of it to my nephew.  Peter first of all it was a real pleasure to see you again, and I am serious about us getting a chance to fish together this summer. I'm really looking forward to it. As for the lawn mower; I did it because I enjoy helping others and it is something I can contribute, but there is more to this story.  Peter showed up at my work, went and picked up coffee and hot chocolat and Tim Bits for the whole crew; paid for the parts, then insisted I take the CTC gift card which was way too much. Peter, your genorosity overwhelms me!  Have a safe trip my friend and give me a shout when you get back."

343397,wuchikubo,2009-05-20 22:21:00,1114, I'll Second that!!!
343405,Roy,2009-05-20 22:46:00,13728,"WOW! Is this ever a timely thread.  I was fortunate enough to spend a weekend with J at Cliff and Sue's place some years ago. The most kind-hearted people you'd ever want to meet. Well, now I feel blessed because Cliff happens to be coming to my house this Saturday. I can probably never come close to the hospitality that they showed us but I'll certainly try. Looking forward to seeing you again Cliff.....plus some extra friends as well!  WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!"
