342935,Zib,2009-05-19 18:25:00,369,The DNR biologist on LSC posted this picture taken yesterday (5/18) of musky they netted while doing their survey on Anchor Bay (LSC). He said it was the most musky they ever netted at once (14 musky). He said the biggest one was 30 Lbs.    Less than 3 weeks & musky season opens on LSC.     I can't wait.
