343122,limeyangler,2009-05-20 03:14:00,5204,"I can relate to that too John, we had a blizzard here in Dryden for opening weekend."
343124,holdfast,2009-05-20 03:35:00,1813,Thought I was going to get heat stroke in Big River.  Bring on the Carbon Tax       
343125,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-20 03:39:00,10439,"  Yep, Wednesday and Thursday suck but the rest of the week looks good. I moved up here to get away from that hot, humid weather as well as the polution in Toronto and surrounding area. Nothing like driving to TO. from the North and seeing that beautiful brown haze covering the city. It got to the point that I was having breathing problems because of the bad air. I don't have that problem any more."
343128,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-20 03:52:00,947,"yea I wish i was where you are for sure, But it's not to bad in my town and i'm only 1 1/2 from the city.  I couldn't imagine how clean and crisp the air would be 5000Km away from me, can you jar it and ship me a dozen  lol."
