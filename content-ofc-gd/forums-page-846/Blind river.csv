342771,rob v,2009-05-19 02:09:00,535,My son and I may be visiting  a friend of his in blind river in the next week or two.   I was thinking about taking the boat and making a fishing trip out of it.  any suggestions on good walleye fishing lakes in the area ?  We've never been there and I'm looking for some suggestions.   Appreciate any in-site.  thanks.

Mississagi River just west of town also has walleyes as well as a good mix of other species.  I don't fish for them myself, mostly stick to trout and salmon but I know they're there."
