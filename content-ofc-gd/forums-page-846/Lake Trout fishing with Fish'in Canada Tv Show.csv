342462,Meegs,2009-05-17 22:00:00,249,ive tried them for the past number of years here on simcoe.   ive had excellent luck with them in northern lakes but not here on simcoe.   for whatever reason that is.

342468,Joeytier,2009-05-17 22:28:00,3990,Those are some giant lakers.  Nice going.  How fast were you trolling for those fish?  The usual salmon speed (2.5 to 3) or slower?
342705,Kerry,2009-05-18 22:19:00,383,"Hey meegs, you gotta pic of one or anybody sell them near Orillia.Trombly's doesn't have them. Thanks Kerry"

342974,huey graphite,2009-05-19 20:16:00,362,Great pics Steve. Fish'n Canada is one of my favourites as well. I'll have to watch for that episode. I recall watching you use the cowbells and peanut setup for lake trout with Charlie Wray on Fishful Thinking. Was that out of Grimsby?
