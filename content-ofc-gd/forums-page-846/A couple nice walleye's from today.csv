It'll be dead for 20 mins then fast action for a while, then dead again.  All the nice female spawners are still hanging near the current areas.  Makes them pretty easy to target at this time of year.  Makes catch and release on those big females all the more important.  Speaking of C&R, we caught the same 24"" walleye two times in 15 mins.  She had a big scar on her side so we knew it was the same fish.  Anyhow, here's some fish porn.  This 27.5""er was my 3rd fish of the day.... 5 mins in   At the end of the day we stopped back at the spot where I got the 27.5"" and low and behold.... another nice walleye.  27"" "

342791,solopaddler,2009-05-19 02:59:00,8605,"Awesome Ben. I wish my lake had current areas to target, that would make things a lot easier. (tough bite for me last week)."
342792,JohnAB,2009-05-19 02:59:00,178,Lac Seul serves up a couple of more beauties. Good job Ben.
342795,limeyangler,2009-05-19 03:21:00,5204,awesome again Mr. beattie. so....got any room in your boat this week (nudge nudge...wink wink)
343004,Leecher,2009-05-19 22:29:00,7832,Great report and pics Ben You are so lucky to be able to get into quality eyes like that    Excellent job You might want to bring along a paper puncher to mark a fin to be able to identify any fish you caught before.... that's what my brother-in-law and I do up at his lake for bass  Here's an example of a bass I caught last year and notice the little hole in the upper part of the tail fin    It doesn't hurt the fish and you would definitely see that if you catch the same fish twice Again awesome job Ben!!! and thanks for sharing Jacques
