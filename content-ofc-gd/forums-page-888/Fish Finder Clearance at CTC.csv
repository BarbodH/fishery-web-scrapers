313031,Fang,2009-03-04 14:40:00,1330,Was wandering through CTC at Mavis and Britannia on Monday and saw they were clearing out the Hummingbird 535 for $114. On Monday they had 2 units. Not posted on the web site so you can't check where else this might be available. You can go instore and ask them to check the store computer for anything nearby.  I'm set on a new colour/GPS upgrade or else I would have bought 1. Long time Lowrance user but my buddy won a Hummingbird last year and has been prety impressed over the summer
