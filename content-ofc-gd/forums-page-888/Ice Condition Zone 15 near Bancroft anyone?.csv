312772,Jet,2009-03-02 15:14:00,364,"Hi guys,  I'm thinking about going out to Zone 15, specifically Big Cedar Lake (north of Peterborough, just south of Bancroft) and wondering if anyone here can provide feedback on the ice conditions for Lakes in that area and how thick it is.  It will be my first trip up there for ice fishing. I'm taking some new fisherpeople and want to see if anyone can help me out before I make the long drive up there.  Thanks in advance.  Jet"

313008,Jer,2009-03-04 14:02:00,1426,What are you fishing for?  I've fished the lake a few times in the summer and never seen anything other than bass & muskie.
313035,Jet,2009-03-04 14:41:00,364,"  That's good news. You think it will be ok for Saturday with the mild weather. I'm thinking yes, since I've gone on Simcoe after two days of unseasonably warm weather."
313037,Jet,2009-03-04 14:42:00,364,"  There are Walleye in there, also going to target some pan fish."
313043,Paully,2009-03-04 14:50:00,712,I was up there this weekend... near wilberforce. There was probably 20 to 24 inches ice and after fridays rain combined with a low of -20 saturday morning it was like an ice rink! We dident catch anything thou... just a buzz. Good luck and let us know how you made out!
