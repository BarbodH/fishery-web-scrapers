There are 2 seniors, 14 adults, and 3 kids under 2 years old coming along, so we are having a hard time finding somewhere to accomodate us all.  Musky fishing is the main priority for myself, however there are others coming along who are interested in biking/hiking or other sports.  We are looking anywhere between Ottawa/St. lawrence rivers to st. clair up to nipissing.  We have stayed on the Kawarthas the last 5 years but are tired of the same old scenery and the smaller fish.  We are hoping to get a couple of cabins for the kids' sake and then take a fifth wheel / tents for te rest of us.  Thanks!  Mark"

Sorry I can't help you with cottage rentals but I am sure with a little Google wizardry you can find some cottages.  I go Camping in this area Voyageur Provincial Park.  Have a nice vacation."
