313015,Jer,2009-03-04 14:17:00,1426,Whatever you can find to work for you is great. The Champix didn't work for me (the dreams were cool though).  I've been chewing the Nicorette (only a piece or two a day) and that seems to work for me. I've been 6 weeks more or less smoke free.
313132,Flappn,2009-03-04 17:56:00,245,I've been smoke free Since Junly 26th 2008 after taking Champex. Dreams were wild and the cravings still exisited it just helped deal with them. Still found it very difficult to quite but I did it and I will never go back again.  I still love the smell though...man o man
313137,camillj,2009-03-04 18:00:00,1988,Good stuff .. I am 2 years today !!!! Cold turkey .. no nicorettes no patches ... just no smokes ...  You can do it ... one day at a time ... just dont light up the next one and you'll be fine !
313141,bigfish1965,2009-03-04 18:12:00,3382,did it make you miserable? i tried the Zyban but thought i was going to murder someone quick so I went off it.
313144,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-04 18:26:00,4399,"No not at all, I have not really had any negative side effect with the exception of some strange dreams which are kind of cool.  I still have the odd craving but these are more mental cravings, the physical cravings have pretty much disappeared."
313157,Jer,2009-03-04 18:55:00,1426,"  The dreams are kinda cool, sometimes a little too realistic though. I got off the pills after one night dreaming about the longest pee I've ever had. I woke up mid-stream and you can guess the rest.  Sandra was not impressed."
313168,Motorhead,2009-03-04 19:36:00,163,I just got back from my Doctor with a 3 month prescription....  2 weeks from today and no more smokes....  Doug
313182,Flappn,2009-03-04 20:03:00,245,Depression and or suicidal tendencies are side effects of Champex FOR SOME. I did find I was depressed....but I wasn't suicidal.
313186,wvmedic,2009-03-04 20:14:00,144,"Congratulation to all, smoking is a hard thing to quit.  I went cold turkey several years ago and did well, but I have started back and I have been thinking real hard about the nicotine gum.  What ever you do, do not give in to you’re urges no matter how long it has been since you quit. Don’t think I can just take a puff or two and I will be ok, I just want to get a taste it wont effect me. For some maybe but for the most of us no way no how, that is exactly how I started back.  Jeff."
313486,sandybay,2009-03-05 12:53:00,64,Its been 6+ weeks for me on the Champix. I took a puff about 10 days in just to see and it tasted like I licked an ashtray. Bedtime is like going to the movies.
313552,fishermccann,2009-03-05 15:42:00,655,I have been smoke free since Jan 5th 09 Champex worked and I think the dreams are worth selling the stuff on the streetcorner for.
