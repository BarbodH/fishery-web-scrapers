313477,fishaquarist,2009-03-05 12:21:00,1,Starting the end of April i will be moving upto lake rosseau to Minet ontario to the J.W. Marriot resort working on the golf course. this is my first time headed up north and am looking at doing a bunch of fishing in my time off. just wondering how accessible fishing is and how far i would have to go (i dont have a boat). are there rivers or ponds that run through it? i looked on google earth but they dont have it available to zoom in and check it out. i saw an earlier post about what kind of fish are in the lake but would like some more details if anyone has them thanks

Mostly the land beside the lake is owned by cottagers.  There is a tiny causeway that was built to Royal Muskoka Island.   you could stand there and cast.  I am having trouble remembering how deep the water is there.   Haven't been up there for about 5 years.   Is that resort the one that is replacing Cleveland's House?
