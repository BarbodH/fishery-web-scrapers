312941,young_one,2009-03-04 06:51:00,620,"Ive been ice fishing this Bay thats connected to a Great Lake for Pike without consistant success.   I would like some help from you guys. Deepest point in the Bay ~13 fow (close to the middle)  Ive caught most of my fish with with set-lines, quick strike rig with a single 1/4 split shot few inches above a live shiner minnow. So far I find 7-10 fow seem to produce for me, but I see other anglers fishing the deepest point exclusively. I think there might be a tiny bit of current in this bay due to the movement of the great lake.  I once hooked a nice size pike using a William ice jig, so I guess every now and then the pike could be acive.  Any other productive tactics I should try? I like jiging with one line and set line on the other, lure recommandation and how I should jig them? Location?  Hammer handle   Bigger pike (I should use a ruler next time, the 2 rods are very different in length) "
313093,OhioFisherman,2009-03-04 15:43:00,6623,"Dang a pike as long as the rod! Maybe I should have used shorter rods! Pike handle cold water pretty well and spawn early. I don`t ice fish but would be looking at deep edges near shallow spawning areas? Deep can be relative term, 6-8 feet of water with 3 or 4 close by?  Blade baits like a heddon sonar, silver buddy, jigging rapala that swims in a circle?  Live bait set up? my favorite was a worm sinker on the line( for chubs, big minnows) a good quality barrel swivel and a 12 -18 inch leader on the swivel. I varied the weight of the worm sinker to try and keep the bait down at the level I wanted it to be at. A big chub could still bring it up but wouldn`t stay up.  Big bait big fish, can`t picture using a 6-8 inch chub or shiner on that rod though. Again not an ice angler."
313104,chukkk,2009-03-04 16:00:00,57,Was the certain bay Frenchman's ? I don't think there is as many pike in there as it is commonly touted
313111,Paully,2009-03-04 16:26:00,712,Drill multiple holes from the shallows towards the deep area... then try jiggin them with a spoon tipped with a minnow. If your fishing where I think your fishin than thats the avrage size pike ...
313187,trapshooter,2009-03-04 20:15:00,1234,Pick up last months issue of Ontario Out of Doors.  There is an excellent article in there about targeting large pike through the ice.  It is written by Jeff Gustafson.
