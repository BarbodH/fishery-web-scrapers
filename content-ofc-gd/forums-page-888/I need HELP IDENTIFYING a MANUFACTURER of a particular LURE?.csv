312937,rbaquial,2009-03-04 06:42:00,968,"So, a couple years ago I went to a fishing show and I remember it being held at the RICOH CENTRE near the ONTARIO PLACE. Now here are my questions...  1) Who manufactured these lures?  2) Where can I buy them?  3) Do they have a website?  I wanna pickup a few more of these... which is why I'm enrolling as much help as possible! Anyway... I've included 2 shots of them... 1 with flash and the other without. I THINK the lure company had the word ""Canadian"" or ""Canada"" in their name... but I'm not 100% sure...I can't seem to remember the name of this Lure Manufacturer for the life of me! PLEASE HELP!!  Thanks Guys...Here are the images...    "
313039,bigfish1965,2009-03-04 14:49:00,3382,They kinda look like Japanese lures. Matshito or whatever their name is?
313046,Fang,2009-03-04 14:56:00,1330,"Ricks correct, Overseas knock off of the Shad Rap. Little thicker body.  I'm pretty sure I've seen these packaged under ""The Great Canadain Bait Company.  Somebody at the Spring Show had a clear out table of GCB baits but I don't know if any of these were in there. You can find these on ebay for sure.  I've been buying the bigger Super Shad clones for a couple of years now. Get them on ebay from a guy in Florida. Paid $6 each including shipping."

313048,rbaquial,2009-03-04 14:58:00,968,"Fang!! I think you hit it - ""The Great Canadian Bait Company"" - that sounds REALLY familiar!! Thanks boys for the help!!  I'll try doing more research online, hopefully they're whom I'm looking for!"
313049,diggyj,2009-03-04 14:58:00,548,Matzuo?
313096,Fang,2009-03-04 15:49:00,1330,I've bought a few other GBC lures at Grimsby tackle. It might have been these guys with a big 3/$10 table that had a bunch on minnow baits at the Fishing show.
