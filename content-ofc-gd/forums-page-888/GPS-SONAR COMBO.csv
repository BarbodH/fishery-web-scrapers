312894,Maverick,2009-03-04 04:02:00,371,"If you don't want to break the bank, look for a used one. Something like a Humminbird Matrix can be picked up used for a decent price."
312902,tschirk,2009-03-04 04:15:00,261,Eagle is the value brand made by Lowrance...same electronics...great products & good price

312936,grt1,2009-03-04 06:32:00,638,"you can spend lots or not so much, I got an eagle cuda 240 that is a dual unit but you can't run the gps and the depth chart at the same time. you  have to change pages in order to get one or the other.  If you want economy, try the eagle units"

312974,lew,2009-03-04 11:48:00,12766,RadioWorld has some good prices right now on Lowrance combos.  http://radioworld.ca/index.php?cPath=3_204&filter_id=9
312983,motion,2009-03-04 12:32:00,403,I just got a Lowrance combo for 600.00 from Radio World at the boat show. You also need the maps for the unit (another 165.00) You may want to check them out at the Sportsman Show in a couple of weeks . They will most likely have some deals on units. You may also find some good used ones through Kijiji.  Cheers.
313026,Peps,2009-03-04 14:32:00,191,"Thanks guys, i've looked through kajiji and there is nothing there.  Thanks Lew i will look at Radio World and i was leaning towards Lowrance units.  Thanks for all the reply's keep them coming please....  Peps"
313040,Fang,2009-03-04 14:49:00,1330,At Spring Fishing Show Radioworld was by far best $. I've been looking for a good deal for a few months and narrowed my choice down to LMS522 . I'll use this unit for more downrigging/depewater so the LMS has nice power and feature set.  Still reviewing the Hummingbirds before I make a final choice. 787 is a better $ and has the side scanning upgrade available.
313084,duber,2009-03-04 15:31:00,220,I bought the LMS 520 from radioworld for $575 at the show as well.Best deal I've found on them for sure.
313222,scugpg,2009-03-04 21:57:00,1373,LMS-522! Its a real nice unit at a great price right now.  I find the Lowrance units have a much better display than humminbird.
