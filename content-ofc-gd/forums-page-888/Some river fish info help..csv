312938,tonewhy,2009-03-04 06:42:00,5,"Hi i'm sort of new to fishing in rivers. I live inside the GTA, and i have heard there are a number of species that live in the rivers around the area. I was wondering when do these fish migrate up river? Lets say the sucker fish since they are numerous. I believe trout also run, but the season doesn't open until april/may?  Thank you, Tony"

312951,brifishrgy,2009-03-04 10:13:00,559,Suckers come up in the spring as well as trout (some are there now) .. trout doesn't open until the end of April in most rivers .. there are some rivers with extended seasons/open all year on certain stretches of the river
