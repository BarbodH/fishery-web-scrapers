312995,Fishmaster,2009-03-04 13:19:00,920,Love your Winter Lake Ont reports ...but i do think your a little Crazy going out in 32deg water temps with no Survival  Life Jaket on ..not that it will save your life but atleast they will find you ....
312996,aniceguy,2009-03-04 13:31:00,1094,"this is a great report,"
313161,ehg,2009-03-04 19:06:00,2666," Having done similar reports for last 5 years or so;  this is the first one that has brought up a question of safety. I applaud that because these posts are done with trepidation. I wouldn't encourage anyone to try this, but just like catching fish and posting pics of adventure. Thanks aniceguy! All the replies have been great. ehg"
313163,tinbanger,2009-03-04 19:18:00,1028,"awesome job guys , great pics.  don""t want to jump on the bandwagon but put some serious thought to at the very least PFDS worn properly. At 50 plus trips you may be pushing the odds. Floater suits less thna $200 !  And it appears there are some people that care about you .  Now get back out there and catch some more fish for us that don't have fortitude to do it ! LOL  TB"
313164,ehg,2009-03-04 19:30:00,2666," Wow, more concern! I think this is similar to people driving thier vehicle out onto Simcoe to the whitie grounds. There is a risk involved but some have experience and do it quite often. We always try to stay close to shore as seen in pics."
313167,Sinker,2009-03-04 19:35:00,8692,"Ehg, if my 12 footer wasn't ripped off, I'd be out there with ya.  I always enjoy your reports!  Sinker"
313171,1Harringtona,2009-03-04 19:39:00,77,Hey great job at catching frozen fish sticks lol
313173,tinbanger,2009-03-04 19:42:00,1028," Take it as a compliment ! Not bashing you guys.  Also similar to fishing big water alone ( Gbay ,which I do ) PFD stays on , destination and return times confirmed , weather forecasts checked , Cell phone charged ( Marine radio is planned for this year) GPS , etc. But still a risk , just try and eliminate the things you can.  TB"
313247,majorlifts,2009-03-04 22:58:00,171,"I would like to get a new PFD suit. In fact I will look into craiglist, and buy n sell, but then I think I saw one for $200 at Tightlines in Pickering.  BTW, Im not sure why Im always lippin the fish, I think if I have a good control of the head without hurtin the fish it makes for easy release. Oh and gloves are a necessity for that."
313407,Mike the Pike,2009-03-05 03:35:00,3421,Hardcore but I love your reports this time of year just sick of winter nice to see some open water.
313587,Paulus,2009-03-05 17:45:00,522,"I remember that stretch of water well & used to fish it from shore. Well done, and nice pics!  p.-"
312078,ehg,2009-03-01 02:23:00,2666,"Whenever the winds are from the north on a Saturday in the winter i like to try and get out on the big water. Today seemed like that type of day. Got to the launching area and the breeze was onshore however it was light. Was able to get to spot but it sure was choppy with increasing winds from the southeast unfortunately going across a large fetch of lake. Good thing we tried for a a bit before we got chased off the lake by whitecaps. The fishing turned out pretty good. It was cold - 10 C (14F) when we went out but we were to busy catching to feel it. As usual i will post a few pictures...  Here is some of the scrappy little browns we catch. My buddy Dave with first one..   I caught one as well   Here is a few more browns we caught always a lot of fun.     Catch the White Bass here as well some pics of them.      A nice doubleheader picture of big White Bass       The next couple of fish we don't catch a lot at this place but today they were there., A couple of rainbow trout. A cute little guy that i luckily got a picture of before it shook out of Davids hands    A bigger bow...  A better pose   Dave also briefly had on a huge bow that started doing cartwheels and flips in front of us after it got unhooked. Must had been well over 15 lbs or so. Also caught some OOS smallmouth way offshore when trolling which was a surprise. All fish were caught on Rattlin' Raps in shad colour.  Quickly we had to leave as it started getting to rough, too bad as the catching was constant and there was an hour or more of light. It was probably a good decision judging by our brutal boat ride back.  Hope you enjoy the pictures and cheers, ehg"
312080,Joey,2009-03-01 02:25:00,9122,"Wow, you are brave to go out there in this cold and wind, whew!!  Great report.  Nice mixed bag of fish there  Joey"
312081,Greencoachdog,2009-03-01 02:29:00,8163,Another great report and pics Erik!!!  It looks pretty dang cold out there and y'all are hardcore for enduring it!!!  Thanks for posting that!
312094,Leecher,2009-03-01 02:52:00,7832,Great report and pics ehg Kudos to you guys for braving mother nature today  Cause it was cold     Real nice looking browns and good mix bag of fish Thanks for sharing Leechman
312096,irishfield,2009-03-01 02:56:00,26272,Another great outing on the Big O Erik... now do those snaps  up next time it's rough...
312102,snag,2009-03-01 03:07:00,1932,Chuck Norris called;  He wants his balls back.   Charles Bronson called;  He's giving you the lead in Death Wish IV    Fantastic Erik!  I'll bother you later!
312112,Joeytier,2009-03-01 03:25:00,3990,Nice going.  It's always a nice surprise when a couple bows pop up in there eh? The whities also provide a nice filler when the browns die off.
312135,TerryC,2009-03-01 04:35:00,196,"Awesome post, I had a flat on my car today and decided to leave it until tomorrow because I thought it was too cold out.  You either CRAZY TOUGH or just plain CRAZY.........  Cheers,  Clarence"
312137,BassAsin,2009-03-01 04:36:00,806,"good on ya for getting out there, them are some beauty lookin fish to top it off  thanks for sharing  Matt!"
312140,misfish,2009-03-01 04:50:00,29133,"Ah you were out at the plant.Good fishing there,all season  long. TFS"
312161,ehg,2009-03-01 05:42:00,2666,"     It really didn't feel as cold with the stronger sun these days, There was a guy out wakeboarding there by the beach.  We were covered in ice from wave crashing and wind when we got back.  Thanks for further replies!"
312184,b2kptbo,2009-03-01 12:13:00,1505,"Good on ya's for getting out there, but man it looked cold..."
312221,Burtess,2009-03-01 14:33:00,901,"Great report, looks like a productive day, lots of variety too....  But you guys seriously need to get some floater suits.  Going out in this weather in a tinny with a undone lifejacket on one, and nothing on the other guy is not good.  Play safe!!  Burt"
312268,ehg,2009-03-01 16:13:00,2666,"   Youse are right to show some concern, it's appreciated. It is very dangerous to do this in that boat but trust me safety is our primary concern when doing this, when the lifejacket is off or open is when we are sheltered and close to shore. I had some line clippers and camera in that jacket so lifejacket was unsnapped at those moments. When travelling both our lifejackets are on, even in past we used floater suits but we've done this over 50 times.   Not a recommended way of fishing unless you have experience and are hardcore. Just like to catch fish."
312274,majorlifts,2009-03-01 16:19:00,171,"Very true Burtess, best advice no doubt as it did get a little hairy there. All in all, it was an insane fishin day, totally worthy of its own fishing show. We could have well been slammin fish till dusk, but that just wasnt in the cards. Interestingly though, I find the best fishing is when the weather is not so generous.  PS: Dont ever, and I mean EVER!!, do this unless you have a very good weather source that you understand and can follow with ease. Because Death is inevitable when the winds become to strong."
312275,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-01 16:20:00,260,Hardcore for sure  Great pics and thanks for the post
312278,majorlifts,2009-03-01 16:25:00,171,"OMG!!! The bouy oh boy, STOLEN!!!! Grrrrrrr, I loved that suit."
312281,Mattones,2009-03-01 16:36:00,587,Busy day  great pictures.
312308,Zubris21,2009-03-01 17:51:00,563,"Great report!  thank you for sharing.  That weather looks insane, and you guys must be a little on the crazy side to venture out, but looks like it paid off.  Stay safe!"
312348,Joeytier,2009-03-01 20:15:00,3990,I nearly tipped the boat about a month ago out there on a huge swell.  Very scary stuff.
312514,love2fishhave2work,2009-03-02 00:47:00,212,  Statistics show that it is the most experienced people that typically end up in a bad situation.  Nice pics but that boat and that water and that weather don't look like they should mix.
312559,BillM,2009-03-02 01:56:00,17367,"Erik, your buddy lips everything!!!!  Awesome man, just be safe out there!"
312615,ehg,2009-03-02 03:08:00,2666,Actually that boat and that water and that weather did mix so that we had a amazing fishing day like some other folks we met out fishing that day in a similar way.  Bill you are correct about the lippin. I'll have to check some musky photos
312629,love2fishhave2work,2009-03-02 03:30:00,212, Glad you had a great day.
312681,solopaddler,2009-03-02 11:22:00,8605,Looks a tad bit chilly....but fun! Nice lookin' fish bud.
