313057,snag,2009-03-04 15:05:00,1932,I was really worried about losing my post count
313058,Zubris21,2009-03-04 15:05:00,563,"Great job getting things back up and running.  I'm sure there were a few , stressful moments and lots of hard work on your part.  I hope you know that it does not go unnoticed.  Thanks again!"
313062,osmondrs,2009-03-04 15:10:00,61,"Thanks, guys.  Good to be back.  OFC-withdrawal was beginning to get me down.  Didn't realize I was so addicted in these few months!  Os"
313085,salmon,2009-03-04 15:34:00,334,Thank Goodness It was just a bad dream  Jose
313231,misfish,2009-03-04 22:14:00,29133,"  Great to be back.  Thanks for the hard work guys. And yes,nice to have ya back Rick."
313265,Rattletrap2,2009-03-04 23:50:00,1652,Thanks for the speedy recovery guys. Nice work! Good to see you on here Rick!
313284,aplumma,2009-03-05 00:13:00,6896,Soooo is it a coincident that as Rick gained weight that our bandwidth got bigger also.... I smell conspiracy... owell Thanks again for all of the hard work and the money spent on keeping this board going. I am proud of the owners that profit did not cause you to compromise the boards growth.   Art
313309,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-03-05 01:01:00,0,Thanks folks for all your efforts to get us back communicating once again
313322,tomO,2009-03-05 01:24:00,363,"allright, back to normal thx."
313511,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-05 13:44:00,1362,Good job guys and thanks for your efforts!!   ...I was wondering what was going on the past few days....
312889,TJQ,2009-03-04 03:51:00,7806,"Thank god...  Bottom line...  our bandwidth use was bringing other boards down on the server we were using.  (Thats good, I guess...) So we had to be swithed to a different one with just us on it.  To be honest, our host just pulled the plug, without letting anyone know, even after it was done.  not good business practice as far as Im concerned.  Any way were moved to our new home.  Its gonna cost more, thats for sure, but at least we are back up and running."
312895,kickingfrog,2009-03-04 04:04:00,8333,Don't ever do that again!  Maybe we should remember times like these when we start complaining about things around here.  I'm sure there was lots of hard work put in.  Thanks.
312903,anders,2009-03-04 04:19:00,1168,thanks for all the hard work!  I love this place
312905,HTHM,2009-03-04 04:20:00,4082,Who was the host????
312906,Joey,2009-03-04 04:21:00,9122,"Whew, that was a long haul.  I appreciate you boys putting in the work to get us up and running again.  I know the frustrations you went through.  Nice to see we're back up and running  Joey"
312907,bigfish1965,2009-03-04 04:24:00,3382,It is still our current host. This was a miscommunication between techs and management..we should have been warned first but were not. We have spent the last few days trying to get everything done. Good thing is we have our own server and can do whatever we want. They kept moving us from server to server trying to keep us online within our budget. It was no longer possible. Certainly we are not happy with the way it was handled and there will be more said between us and the host.
312952,lew,2009-03-04 10:13:00,12766,"Good to see you got it all worked out TJ.  And Rick, real nice having you back too Bud !!"
