312389,irishfield,2009-03-01 21:59:00,26272,"I know there's a few airplane buffs that hang out here... enjoy...  Got a call Friday that the, generally annual, Mathedash Lake fly in at John and Silvia Richards was on. Couldn't have picked a better day for my son and I to fly over for some chilli and to see old friends. A bit of a heavy breeze but perfect ice conditions for any landing gear configuration. Shows how many friends this great couple have made over the years. They get 4 times the number of flyins on a couple days notice that other advertised events get. Love John's old Johnson 30's as well... still running like a top 35 years later. Wish I had of remember my ice rods though.... maybe I'll go back this week and do a fishing report as well...              If anyone recognizes this.. the skis where the first thing I saw in Les Strouds Survivor Man Temagami episode and I knew who's airplane it was.. Peter Dale dropped him off on the back lake.      The hosts..John and Silvia Richards                    Two ""homebuilt"" helicopters.        "
312390,Terry,2009-03-01 22:03:00,14456,neat  are the blankets to keep heat in so they start ?
312391,irishfield,2009-03-01 22:05:00,26272,Yes... joys of an updraft carb and air cooled engine.
312392,kickingfrog,2009-03-01 22:07:00,8333,Super cool hobby and way to spend a day.
312396,Radnine,2009-03-01 22:16:00,1538,Now I really am jealous of you up north types. Are those Champs on skis (judging by the CF reg. I would say they are) or are they home builts of some type. They look like homebuilt paint schemes but classic Aeronca lines. What a day for it eh? Thanks for the great post. Jim
312400,irishfield,2009-03-01 22:28:00,26272,"See Jim... instead of pissing and moaning about how cold it is you could get out and enjoy it you know! lol  A mix Jim... some are still certified... some are homebuilts. The jazzy champ is registered amateur built... or at least it' better be with the air master auto pitch prop on it ! lol... I'll look it up!  Edit:  FIVT is in owner maintenance... so prop is, as long as he's logged it, legal."
312414,Leecher,2009-03-01 22:46:00,7832,"You said it Wayne ""Couldn't have picked a better day..."" Awesome    Thanks for sharing Leechman"
312451,Bernie,2009-03-01 23:40:00,3190,"I love aircraft Wayne. Been up a few times over the years and it's a thrill every time. A local aircraft club took my scout troop up about 12 years ago. It was very good of them. Here is a pic I found in dads collection of slides from around 1950. No idea what it is.    By the way, an uncle of mine still runs one of those old Johnsons too. Runs like a top!"
312455,irishfield,2009-03-01 23:44:00,26272,Stinson 108 Bernie... there was a beauty parked right beside mine today.. let me find a shot.  
312483,Sinker,2009-03-02 00:14:00,8692,Cool way to spend a day. I'm sure I speak for many of us when I say I'm jealous!!  Sinker
312490,BillM,2009-03-02 00:24:00,17367,"Wayne, that's awesome man!!!"
312495,Joey,2009-03-02 00:26:00,9122,"Those are great pics Wayne.  We had a plane like that buzz us on Simcoe today.  I wondered what those ""nose hats"" were for too, or should I call them plane bras  Joey"
312498,Bernie,2009-03-02 00:28:00,3190,Thanks for finding that picture. Much pride and care taken in those aircraft Wayne. Beautifully maintained.
312501,BillM,2009-03-02 00:34:00,17367,"Joey, I am sure Wayne call's his a 'bro'   :)"
312505,irishfield,2009-03-02 00:38:00,26272,Na... I call it a moving quilt ! lol  And Shayne... it's all priorities. Some brew their own coffee... some shop at Starbucks ! Less money in my airplane than many fishing boats.
312563,walleyemaster,2009-03-02 02:04:00,325,wow..real nice planes out there.... good job wayne
312688,Spiel,2009-03-02 11:49:00,9065,"That's ""totally awesome"" Wayne.    I could easily enjoy a day (or lifetime) of doing stuff like that! Could I get started with a few hundred."
312725,corvette1,2009-03-02 13:40:00,1765,what an awesome picture on the ice
