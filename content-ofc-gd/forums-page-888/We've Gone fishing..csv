I think it sounds great but he is still complaining about the sound...Musician thing i guess huh?....lol  Anyway thought i would share....He wrote the music and lyrics in a little over two hrs and this was his second time singing and playing it.. Boy do i ever wish i had his gift!!  Here is the video.....  The name of the Song is.  We've gone fishing.     Nauti.
