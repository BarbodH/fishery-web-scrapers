This option is located at the buttom of the General Discussion screen.  There seem to be a problem with skin version.  Jacques aka Leechman"

313248,chukkk,2009-03-04 23:00:00,57,A little off topic but I think it's fair for a lot of us to say thanks to OFC  for the work and money that goes into this most excellent forum. A lot of us were in shock when we couldn't get it for a couple of days.The thing I like about this place is a variety of help and topics besides our beloved sport of angling. We should and I do support  anything that OFC is involved in and let people know we appreciate this. No I am not connected to OFC. I just enjoy  the forum and camaraderie that exists here
