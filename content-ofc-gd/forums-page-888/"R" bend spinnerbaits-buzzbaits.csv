312329,bassjnkie,2009-03-01 18:45:00,1101,"May be some one can help me out with this. I usually tie me flouo to the ""R"" bend, but is there a way of making it, so that I can use a snap as a quick change. Any ideas?"
312332,steverowbotham,2009-03-01 18:55:00,1800,"you can put a small rubber band or silicone tubing over the r-bend that will prevent the snap from sliding.  PErsonally, I prefer to tie direct."
312334,smokin joe,2009-03-01 18:57:00,226,"There have been a few threads on this, you may want to do a search.  I personally like to use a piece of surgical tubing or electrician heatshrink, slid down over the R Bend to close it"
312335,PatrickGG,2009-03-01 18:59:00,562,"I use rubber tubing also, you can find them in the fly tackle section or where they hold floats and bobbers at any tackle shop."
312336,jwl,2009-03-01 19:18:00,1056,"I just tie them straight on..I find if you use a snap or a swivel it goofs up the action of the lure..you want it to run as straight as you can...even after I catch a couple fish on one, I toss it out to check the action, if it is not running true, I bend the wire until I get the straightest action I can."
312340,purekgw,2009-03-01 19:37:00,585,buy more rods?
312354,Radnine,2009-03-01 20:25:00,1538,Does anyone know why there is an R bend? Why aren't they all closed loops? Jim
312364,Terry,2009-03-01 20:56:00,14456,the r vibrates better/more  and we like good vibrations
312366,irishfield,2009-03-01 20:57:00,26272,I just thought it was to cheapen the cost of manufacturing. I twist all those shut.....
312368,Radnine,2009-03-01 21:02:00,1538,me too
312376,bassjnkie,2009-03-01 21:29:00,1101,Thanks for the tips everyone. I will try some of the suggestions.
312379,jediangler,2009-03-01 21:31:00,1923,"I use surgical tubing from an aquarium services store. Gotta have the good vibrations from the ""R"" bend."
312380,jwl,2009-03-01 21:33:00,1056,I think it is to make the wire run straighter than with a twist in it.......I have way more success for fish on R bend spinner baits than twisted ones.
312427,SlowPoke,2009-03-01 23:00:00,2984,A little thread.  
312610,spinnerdoc,2009-03-02 03:01:00,556,i use heat shrink tubing on some of my spinners. not all of them though. just the ones that slide too much.
312693,singingdog,2009-03-02 12:00:00,1047,"Wrap some braided line around the base of the R, then add a  spot of super-glue. The only time I do this is for Musky/Pike. Otherwise, I tie directly to the fram."
312750,JohnF,2009-03-02 14:25:00,3494, Wouldn't that inhibit the vibrations? Seems to me adding anything is gonna alter the flow of water over/past the lure. A twist in the wire would be less disruptive.  JF
312753,charlesn,2009-03-02 14:28:00,551," The action as stated above and also the line can get caught in the twisted loop causing a breakage on the hook set.  Happened to me a couple times.  I would tie direct, even for toothy critters.  I can't remember the last time I got bit off by a pike or musky on a spinnerbait, doesn't happen very often compared to getting bit off on like a jig or soft plastic."
312788,jwl,2009-03-02 15:52:00,1056," I agree, the spinner baits are big enough that I rarely get any spinner baits bitten off by pike and muskies as well"
312918,John Bacon,2009-03-04 04:45:00,3277,I just use a snap directly on the wire.  In the vast majority of casts the snap will slide down to the R Bend where it belongs.  I do occassionly have the snap slide up the spinner; but it doesn't happen often enough to bothered adding any sort of contraption to prevent it.
313192,legacey,2009-03-04 20:26:00,127," ....I loose, on average, 3-5 spinner baits everytime I fish loughborough lake from pike.  I get told all the time though, it's always just me! Reading this, they must be right!  Cheers,  Paul"
313219,droopdude,2009-03-04 21:55:00,10,I put a split ring over the r-bend then attach my snap.
313224,bassjnkie,2009-03-04 22:01:00,1101,"Well I did the silicone and thread thing and headed off to The Ponds, there was only a little open water, but enough to test them out. Put it this way, the snap idea is not for me, I just didn't like the feel. I think I will just buy a few more rods and tie directly to the bait like I always did.  Anyways thanks for all the suggestions and ideas."
