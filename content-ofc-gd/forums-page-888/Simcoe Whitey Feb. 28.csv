Overall it was a decent day, but I really had to move around a lot trying to mark fish. It was pretty cold, luckily I just got my HH float suit from Hirks a few days before and got to test it out for the first time. Happy to say it kept me really warm. "
313460,Terry,2009-03-05 10:37:00,14456,they are nice float suits  and real nice whitefish too
313487,b2kptbo,2009-03-05 12:54:00,1505,"Good size whitefish, good work..."
313488,Greencoachdog,2009-03-05 13:04:00,8163,That is a nice Whitefish!  Did you take it home to dinner?
313492,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-05 13:07:00,1362,Nice Whitie  ....when you say that you tested your HH suit out...did ya go for a dip in the drink???
313526,Jet,2009-03-05 14:51:00,364,"Ya this one went home for a date with some fish crisp and it was thoroughly enjoyed. And so far i've only tested the suit in the cold Simcoe air and I hope it stays that way! But at least I'm protected in the event. That's why I invested in one because the rest of this season and next I'm going to explore a lot of back lakes, so safety is definitely top priority.  Oh ya forgot to mention, hit this Whitey and my last 2, using a William H/H. What was different was that each one hit after I let the spoon swim way out to the side, then jigging it progressively back to the center of the hole. In fact the last three Whities were caught jigging about 10 to 15 feet off bottom and always on the first drop down the hole and letting it swim way off to the side of the hole."
