313312,camillj,2009-03-05 01:05:00,1988,er ... ummmm ... look at my post count .... I agree ... ummm .. no .. I mean ... bite me !   Truth is the most important word in our URL is community ... If I put the time in to post a story and some pics ... I expect a few of the old boys (gals) club ... you know who you are .... to chime in and pat me on the back ... thats just the way it works ... and more importantly its why it works ...
313321,Pinch,2009-03-05 01:23:00,231," Part of the problem with people not posting comments, however big or however small, could be because of comments like below....(Sorry to single you out Ehg, yours was the first example I came across).   On one hand people complain that users don't post and then when they do, more people complain about what they do post.  Not everyone is going to agree with each other but doesn't it all add to the community of the board?  I have rarely been able to get out fishing in the past couple years, and when I have been able to I haven't caught anything worth reporting, thus no reports, thus not many other comments in case Im told to post a report.  Anyhow,  this is my ice fishing report for the past three ice fishing seasons.  ATV $12000 Ice Hut, cover, hitch $500 Auger $60 Rods and tackle $130 Bait $145  Going out 10 times in three years with only 9 perch to show for it (all caught this year)......PRICELESS"
313324,maybe,2009-03-05 01:32:00,307," I think #3's a great idea, especially for the guys who xpost the same brazen spam to every site they can think of, and never give anything back to the group for the advertising value they're getting.  If it smells like a brochure, and google finds it on 3 message boards, I say they automatically owe you Showcase dues.  You're absolutely right about the donation entitlement thing.  There's just no way to get through that obstacle course without mud splattering all over the place.  I found the easiest way to deal with it for my listserv is to just pay the expenses out of my own pocket (~$1k/yr) and consider it like any other charitable contribution (minus the tax perks, dangit).  Am I the only one noticing that sig file pics in posts criticizing the site tend to break the 500 x 75 rule the mods keep pleading with us to follow?  Pinch...that report made me laugh.  Thanks!"
313349,Greencoachdog,2009-03-05 02:17:00,8163," Up your post count and we'll talk... Loser!    First thing!..., words on the internet are just that... words on the internet, an encyclopedia of them don't amount to a hill of beans!  You've got to have thick skin if you're going to post on the internet, someone is always going to try to shoot you down!  Like Radnines sig says, if you're going to count your fishin' trips by the number of fish you catch... you may as well be golfing!  Just look at some of Irishfields reports, mainly scenery reports!!! (he is getting better though)  We don't care if your fish cost $1426.12 each or $14,261.20 each... we wanna see them!!!... or are we not worthy of your time to write a report?   If you're going to be part of the ""Peanut Gallery"" and sit back and wait to criticize someone else's post without really participating in the way that this forum was meant to be used.. you're just as bad or worse than the one you criticized!!!"
313361,Sinker,2009-03-05 02:26:00,8692,"IMO a fish less report is just as valuable as a report of a haul fest.  Sometimes you learn more about fish on the days they don't bite. I'm sure if you were skunked, someone would chime in and offer some advice/tips on what you were doing right or wrong. Try it, you may like it.  I post a quick wtg type reply because I feel like I'd be ignoring some members that I know personally. Other times I just enjoyed the reading or pics. Sometimes I don't say anything. I like the how to posts the best, its amazing the things you learn from reading this site. You just never know what's going to come up, and no question is a stupid one.  Sinker"
313380,Daplumma,2009-03-05 03:04:00,1961,Sorry to snip you bud but what aboot an anonymous donation button?No entitlement there and a few bux from all of us would go a long way toward keeping this thing going. Joe

313399,walleyejigger,2009-03-05 03:24:00,876,"great reply Terry,  on report threads, i for one, have a high percentage of posts of the ""few words"" kind, like GCD said, to acknowledge i read/enjoyed the thread and the time it took to make it, i used to make many reports with pictures when i first started here and usually got one or two replies to it, i figured because at the time i cant remeber any members from sudbury or timmins (other then Pam and Dan the man....whatever happen to him) which were the areas i fish, and figured the low reply count was because nobody was interested in those areas, got to the point where i didn't think it was worth the effort,  99% percent of the reports made i've never been to those lakes or areas or fished for those species, but i still enjoy them, maybe i'll give it a go again  anyhow great community, thx for having me"
313405,GBW,2009-03-05 03:35:00,8460,"a reply/post is a reply/post.  the count doesn't mean a thing to me and I have been on boards like this for the past 7 years or more.  everyone has to join at some point and start out at zero BUT they could be the best at what they do and know a whole lot so if you look at the post count the reply to judge if they know what they are talking about then you are selling yourself short.  Look at all the Ontario fishing hosts we have on this board and if that persons post count was 12 would you listen?  I would...  money for the servers...  tough one...  I do like the idea I read about for more auctions to go towards the bills.  In the end, WTG..."

313489,ehg,2009-03-05 13:06:00,2666,I don't think any post is 'garbage'. Those with only a few words are usually just a bump of appreciation for ones effort.  Being critical of criticism is hypocritical i guess though. ehg

313550,Zubris21,2009-03-05 15:37:00,563,"I don't think monitoring our post-counts will be productive at all.  As many have said it would erode the ""community"" environment that is in place here.  Personally, post count does not matter to me, I enjoy reading all of the fishing reports and will often thank the original poster for sharing their experience.  Fish or no fish, being outside and ""giving it a go"" is enviable.  As for the peanut gallery, I wish people would contribute more often, it is somewhat discouraging to go through the time and effort (all be it, it doesn't take much) to create a report, only to find 100's of people viewing it, but only a handful of replies, sometimes it seem the effort unappreciated, or people are taking advantage of ones generosity.  I wish I had more advice to offer on the technical topics, but there are others here that have much more knowledge on these than me, if I can't answer a specific question I wont, but when I can, I will offer and info/advice that I can.  Regular auctions to benefit the site, sounds like a good idea!  I'm sure people have many items they would be willing to donate.  In any event, Im sure if the board was in need, the outstanding people here would lend a helping hand in any way they could."
313061,JohnF,2009-03-04 15:10:00,3494,1. Should we all think twice before sending posts that offer nothing but another notch on our post count?  2. Should we start paying something for this?  JF

A good one goes something like this as a reply to the OP.  ====================================  I agree XYZ.  ====================================  It amazes me that even though such a post requires a login, composing, sending the post, a logoff, I must assume the poster feels good and proud of posting the above 3 words. I see a number of reasons for posting this garbage.  1. It is to increase one's post count. Let's face facts, some of these guys enjoy seeing their count go up. It is a ""trill"" to them to see their number go up.  2. They are trying to lick XYZ'z as$. Statistically in any group, some are kinky.  3. Some have nothing better to do and so they must feel that they have done something productive for the day.  4. Some of the above in combination. I guess if there is more than one reason, there is more of a ""thrill"".  carp-starter"

313197,TJQ,2009-03-04 20:37:00,7806,"I honestly don't think its ever going to come to the point where we will be asking for $$  At this point we are waiting to see what the bill is gonna be for the upgrades and then we are going to make some ""monitization"" decisions, depending on what we need to do to cover the increased costs.  None of the mods are here to make any real $$ doing this, so as long as we can cover our costs and a bit left over we are fine, which is the way its always been.  I think were going to have to do a couple of things though.  #1 We are going to have to put another bank of google ads at the bottom of the pages.  Because some google advertisers pay by the impression, this will help us out.  #2 I am going to have to go after some more banner sales, I mean its only $100 per year to be up there so another couple of dozen advertisers shouldn't be too hard to get.  #3 We may put up a ""Guides Showcase"" where for an annual fee Guides and Charters can post pictures of their trips and catches.  This would be great for a charters business.  AS a VERY last resort we may put up a PayPal ""donation"" button, but only as a very last resort.  I am of the opinion that this would give a false sense of ""entitlement"" to donators, and create hard feelings along the way.  In any event none of this is critical, were gonna find out what the bill is gonna be and go from there.  One thing everyone can do to help however is turn thier ad blockers off so the google ads can function the way they are supposed to.  Hey thats post 6,750!!"
