312830,EC1,2009-03-02 17:22:00,930,"Hi everyone, I think I've got another question I need some advice on. Being on a student budget, I'm very limited to the amount of cash I have to spend on gear this year, and I'm in the market for a new rod + reel. I want to use everything for quite a few years, but I'm pretty much limited to one or the other right now.  My main goal of this setup would be to have long casts w/ some smoothness in the reel. If I were to get one of those items expensive (Around $100 - $130) and one cheap (around $50 - $70), which budget would you spend on the rod and which on the reel?  By the way, what is more important in making long casts, Rod or Reel?  Thanks in Advance !"
312839,jwl,2009-03-02 17:37:00,1056,"go with the better reel all the way!!!!, something with a ""longcast"" spool and a really smooth drag.  To be honest you don't have to break the bank to get a decent combo, you can often find combos for 90-120 bucks and you get a decent rod and a good reel.  Quantum and Shimano both make decent combos in that price range for example"
312841,rbaquial,2009-03-02 17:44:00,968,"Both ROD & REEL; I believe are generally important if you're after distance... Length to give you that extra 'Leverage' when throwing the bait/lure out there...and the reel needs to be decent, so that when the bait/lure is thrown out there... the reel itself is smooth, and not giving much resistance to the bait/lure itself.  This leads me to asking you another question, What kind of REEL are you after?  LOW-PROFILE BAITCAST ,  ROUND BAITCAST , or a  SPINNING REEL ? If you aren't targeting a particular species of fish, a SPINNING REEL on a MEDIUM-HEAVY 6'6"" 1 or 2PC (depending if you travel a lot when fishing) is a good starter.  As far as REELs suggestions go, I'd personally go with the  ABU GARCIA CARDINAL ; A lot of people have rated it amazingly, yet it should be sturdy/strong enough to last you years to come. I actually picked one up just a few months ago, and I'm excited to test it out!  Regarding RODS; there are a plethora of rods available at an extremely cheap price. For example the  GRAPHITE SERIES by BASS PRO SHOPS  is a good start. It offers reliability (based on reviews from current users/owners) and stability. But if you are after LENGTH and PRICE on a good ROD... I'd personally pick the  SIX RIVERS by BROWNING . Its got the length and price you're both after. This one too I've picked up recently (Browning Six Rivers); I'm excited to try this one out.  Here's a pretty good tip Dave Mercer provides on his website found  HERE  on FactsOfFishing.Com website. You may want to take his tip into consideration when choosing your rod. There are SOME occasions when you DO want your bait/lure out as far as you can (depending on the lake, where you're fishing etc..) but most other times, Dave's tip is exceptional. (You'd be surprised how much that comedic-fisherman knows!)  Anyway, I hope this helps - I'm sure others will post their take as well. Goodluck!"
312842,Raf,2009-03-02 17:44:00,3495,"if it's spinning, focus on the rod  if it's baitcasting, focus on the reel  get a long rod either way for the long bombs (ie. 7-8'6"" )"
312844,diggyj,2009-03-02 17:47:00,548,I would spend more on the REEL.
312849,ld17,2009-03-02 17:53:00,319,"Spend more on the reel.  Shimano is a good choice.  To get long casts with a rod you need to have the proper flex in the tip (not to stiff) which will allow the rod to load properly. This has to be matched ( balanced) with the weight of the lure.  When this is achived, combined with a good thin line will allow maximum distance on you casts.  Bass pro has some good deals coming up this weekend at the fishing show.  If you can make it out you guarantied to find a nice combo for a good price."

312861,grt1,2009-03-02 18:33:00,638,"I have been buying the Quantum ss1 reels at Walmart for some time now. I have 2 of them, 1 ss2 and 1 ss3 they cost about $30 each and for themoney they are quite good. I fish almost every day for at least 2-3 hours and guide quite a bit and they havent let me down and have stood up to a lot of bouncing around in many boats.  Sure i have other more expensive reels but they are all baitcasters. I don't think you have to spend mega bucks to get something that will work for the recreational angler.  I would however spend $100 for a decent rod.  good luck on your choices"
312865,MJL,2009-03-02 18:50:00,2427,"What are you fishing for?  What are you casting?  What do you define as a long cast?  IMO, these questions must be answered if you are to find the best performing outfit to fit your needs.  LD17 pretty much nailed it with regards to what a rod needs to do to cast its farthest.  With that said, unless you’re tournament casting or distance casting in the park, I’d put having a reel with a smooth drag and reliable construction as my main concern when regularly fishing for something over 2lbs.  Today there are reels out there that can be bought for $70-80 that perform very well and should last a lifetime."
312874,EC1,2009-03-02 19:13:00,930,"oh yup sorry. I am trying to get a new spinning setup that is ML for all around Bass / walleye fishing. I just wanted a bit more casting distance than normal, and I was wondering which would of the reel or rod is more important to making those casts.  And thanks for all the replies everyone!"
312891,Maverick,2009-03-04 03:53:00,371,"Like some others have said, I would spend more on the reel. Reels generally cost more to begin with and generally when you spend more on a reel you really notice it. That and you can get a pretty decent rod for 50-70 bucks."
312992,FLEX ROD,2009-03-04 13:11:00,394,"Do not think twice buy the best reel you can afford, and make sure to buy some spare spools for it that way you can get a number of different lines on it and make the reel as versitile as possible.  I have a reel that is still my go to reel and the reel is now 35 years old, DAM QUICK, and ask any body what they think of the old Zebco Cardinals 3, 4, these are reels built for a life time of fishing.  And again buy a longer rod, nothing under 7' once your budget improves then you can start going into the specialty rods, and once you get to this stage good luck as their will be no such thing as disposible income it will be sucked up on the toys.  FLEX - John"
312994,holdfast,2009-03-04 13:17:00,1813,"Get a reel with two spools, Fill one with 6lb that will give you longer casts.  Fill the other with 8 or 10.  Nowyou have two reels in one. Bass and panfish and casting light lures, and the other spool for trolling and anything bigger like a pike.  The Rod doesnt matter because I can cast just as far with a 30 dollar Lightning rod or 90 Dollar Shimano.  What is important is that the tip isnt Fragile and again price dont matter.  Reels would be Quantum SS Mitchell 300 Any Shimano Daiwa Regal Cardinals And check some Shakespeare models  These are good lower end reels to start you with.  The drag is important and if you turn the knob and it tightens instantly stay away from that reel.  Rods Anything from Berkly ie lightning, cherrywood Watch the fragile tips on shimano, some are good, some aren't ugly stick and Rhino is good too, but may be too heavy  As for combination sets, Shimano is good, Daiwa Regal or Samurai is good and of course Cardinal and specialist is pretty good for the price.  Just go to CT or Walmarts as you dont have to go far and watch for sales as they will be there sooner than later.  I think you can get by with a decent set for 70 dollars if you shop around"
313002,Mike Pike,2009-03-04 13:48:00,1332,"And whatever you decide, really fill up that spool to the brim.  And use the lightest diameter line you can get away with for the fish you're going after, and watch your casting distance soar."
313006,ADB,2009-03-04 13:56:00,444,"Like others have said, I would spend my money on the reel, over the rod.  A good reel, compared to a cheaper reel, will: -help to keep your line from tangling and twisting -have a smoother, more reliable drag system -be made from aluminum/graphite, compared to a plastic. -paired with any 7 foot rod, allow you to cast farther.  In my opinion, one of the best rods for the money would be the Fenwick Eagle GT.  The Eagle GT is an extremely lightweight and sensitive rod.  Pick it up, and it will blow you away compared to a similarly priced rod like the Shimano Convergence, which will feel heavy and clunky.  For example, you mentioned wanting a longer, medium light rod.  Le Baron sells the 7 foot, medium light action model for $57.54. http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishing/f...k_techna_av.pdf  At that price you can easily spend $100-$120 on a good reel and still stay within your budget.  For the reel, go with either the Shimano Sahara ($95.36).  At 6.9 ounces, the 1000 model is actually lighter than a lot of the more expensive Shimano reels, including the Stradic and Sustain. http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishing/shimano_sahara.pdf  Or if you want to save a little more money, go with the Daiwa Exceller ($75.63) http://lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishing/daiwa_hardbodyz.pdf  The Shimano is a bit more of a flashy reel, but a lot of people rave about the Exceller as a great reel as well.  It even comes with a spare spool, something Shimano has gone away from.  Hope this helps!"
313011,OhioFisherman,2009-03-04 14:12:00,6623,"I would put my money into a quality reel every time, spinning reels are less costly for the most part than casting reels. A Shimano Sahara is a decent reel, a 1000 series reel is a panfish reel for bass and walleye I would get a 2500-3000 series.  I personally am not much of a fan of light line angling unless it is for panfish or bait. For bass or walleye I want at least 8# test preferably 10#. Light line may be fine in open water, but the longer you play with the fish the more stressed it is."
313134,EC1,2009-03-04 17:58:00,930,"Thanks a lot everyone, Very informative opinions, and thanks for all the options! Will definitely think it through, and go for my purchases in the coming week!"
313196,Hooked,2009-03-04 20:37:00,891,"  Thats pretty much what I was thinking, except a clarus rod, only around $15 more.  The new Regal is only $50 and is a solid reel."
