312016,diggyj,2009-02-28 23:42:00,548,How many of you guys and gals out there use fisherman's glue for your knots? Which one do you use?
312019,purekgw,2009-02-28 23:50:00,585,theres glue lol?
312020,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-28 23:50:00,260,"I use plain old Krazy Glue when I tie a flourocarbon leader onto braid.  I use just a dab after tying shock leader knot and burning a bead on the flourocarbon tag end.  Never had one come apart.  Can pull  the boat around with it when your stuck on bottom  Just got a small container of the repair ""glue"" for soft plastic baits at the spring fishing show from Bass Magnet Lures.  Will be interesting to see how that works.  Go through a lot of soft plastics in the summer."
312035,bassjnkie,2009-03-01 00:30:00,1101,Same as above just Krazy Glue.
312048,brkygetr,2009-03-01 01:29:00,425, I'm with ya on that one....  I'm confused....if you need glue...then you need a better knot.
312051,irishfield,2009-03-01 01:36:00,26272,Only thing I carry Krazy Glue for is to glue peoples gashes shut so they don't bleed to death getting them off the lake and to the hospital!  Only one I know that uses glue is lead core sheath to mono leader.
312067,snag,2009-03-01 02:08:00,1932,"Uh oh,  Is this gonna get locked Dirk?"
312083,douG,2009-03-01 02:31:00,2693,"Grant, I am pretty dang sure that you have the sickness, the one that only more fishing will cure.  As for knots, if they need glue they shouldn't be called knots."
312085,snag,2009-03-01 02:36:00,1932," Doug,  Agreed.  The end of next week looks good............."
312088,douG,2009-03-01 02:41:00,2693,I'm getting a little excited here.  About the pike already.
312093,diggyj,2009-03-01 02:51:00,548,"Grant,  my knots are quality, only asking if people used it since I never have.  Dirk...."
312114,Leecher,2009-03-01 03:36:00,7832,Glue??  no..... never have and don't think ever will.... the only thing I will do to any type of line is burn the tag end after the knot is tied and this is not all the time.... UNI knot for me is what I use and it's one tough knot
312117,Bernie66,2009-03-01 04:00:00,123,"I only use it when I connect my leader to my main line (back to back Uni Knot).  Just a dab with a toothpick and any dollar store superglue will do.  When you tie directly to a hook or a lure, you don't really need glue.  Just learn to tie a proper knot. (palomar, trilene, uni etc.)"
312119,theRJ,2009-03-01 04:03:00,55,Check the label because some of the solvents used in those glues will dissolve lines.  RJ
312395,kickingfrog,2009-03-01 22:16:00,8333,I use it to extend the life of some plastic baits.
313032,hirk,2009-03-04 14:40:00,571,"Dirk you asked a good Q,don't mind the funnies.Sup glue is great for reducing your plastics loss,the heads of the baits don't get ripped on hook shoulders as easy when you glue em,and it's good insurance to glue braided knots,palomar+glue=never fail"
