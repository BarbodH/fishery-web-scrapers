483413,FlyGuy5,2010-07-08 12:20:00,101,Went out in the Morning last Sunday and was able to find a few walleye in around 10fow and was able to boat around 10 or so walleye as well with a few bass.. All and all was a good day.  I hook all walleye on a Fat Rap and hooked up with the bass using a Trigger X leach dropshotting in about 20fow.
