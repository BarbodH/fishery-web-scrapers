483073,ironstone74,2010-07-07 00:51:00,201,I fish the Grand several times a week near sundown and I'm having a hard time locating fish.  Last year I had several 18 and 19 inch fish bit I haven't been close to that this year.  I go to my usual spots and fish the same baits with little action.  I've had a handful of misses on topwaters that were quality fish; the rest have been small and few.  Any other observations?  I'm a little puzzled...  Paul
483075,danbouck,2010-07-07 00:52:00,4380,I have yet to hit the Grand this year even though I can almost see it from my house   Maybe I'll go tomorrow night and let ya know how I make out.
483080,vinnimon,2010-07-07 01:14:00,2593,"  It was a little odd this year.A spot I hit for pickerel at the lower end of the river every year,a honey hole just before bass opener.We usually catch a our limit in walters and a ton of oos bass.Good size ones I may add.This year,the odd pickerel and no bass around.Not one yet on the grand.Everywhere else they where tight lipped,or biting softly!"
483083,spincast,2010-07-07 01:19:00,3279,"I find the bass in the Grand are very sensitive to water levels. I have found that lunker honey holes in a dry year prodcue nothing but timbits  in a wet year. Some of my favourite runs for a couple years in a row will produce nothing the next couple years, then, next year, they're back.  My best weapon in finding where they are in any given year - a canoe and day floating  -------- they always come out to play eventually.... haven't fished up the Kitchener end in a long time though - stayed down Paris  / Glen Morris /Brantford... maybe they moved down here?"
483094,tb4me,2010-07-07 01:44:00,3295,"well no wonder thse guys are not gettin any fish, if your fishin in there, thier all gone.LOL Wheres the winning team 7 fish porn there Spincast???"
483098,zeeter,2010-07-07 01:52:00,92,"Been out twice this year and I usually fish the grand once a week.  First time out the water clarity was very poor and the fishing was also as result.  Second time out they were fairly active and we caught around 25 - 30. There was only one 18 incher.  I found that the usual holes have changed a bit and some new holes have developed.  Water is a powerful thing and the river changes each year.  Fishing in general is also different because of the early spring, water levels and heat, this week anyways."
483113,jediangler,2010-07-07 02:15:00,1923,"I have only been out after Bass in Kitchener once since the season opened. Had no luck either.  Did manage this 25.5"" walleye on June 15/10 in Kitchener while crappie fishing, out of my kayak, in the Grand river."
483145,fishing,2010-07-07 04:10:00,167,"Number and size of bass are down for sure this year. Many people are targeting and keeping them, in season or not. A family kept 6 bass between 7 to 14"". Most fish I caught after the bass opening are gobies, catfish, sucker, rock bass, sheepshead and bowfin. There are a few nice and big walleye and pike in it though."
483151,spincast,2010-07-07 09:36:00,3279,  Hey TB4me - long time no chat - how's the boat restoration going? Fish porn was in the posting that Frankie65 and I put up. For some reason I cant get the photos to upload into the team chat - just keep getting that annying red X box. Grrrrrr. No point uploading thumbs - need a magnifying glass to see them -- you can go here though to see the pics uploaded so farMy link [/img]
483157,Drew_10,2010-07-07 10:57:00,111,"If you've had some quality fish miss your topwater lure, there may be some small factor/characteristic about your topwater plug that is keeping these smallies from fully comitting.  Try using the same topwater lure, but in a smaller size or colour.  Try adding scent or feathered treble hooks.   A little change could make all the difference."
483158,bigugli,2010-07-07 11:01:00,6138,"With this stinking heat it is hard to get the fish to move. I had a couple of fish sitting in a wee pocket last night that would not budge. I tossed everything in my back pack to them and nothing after an hour. All I found was an 8"" rockie for my troubles."
483162,dave524,2010-07-07 11:56:00,4508," just a guess seeing you are from KW, you maybe fishing the upper Grand were the water is lower and clearer than normal now, stealth may be an issue now. You see it more often trout fishing but a bold visible approach to the shore, noisy wading and casting maybe putting the decent fish as they say ""down"". Watch how you approach the bank, kneel to make casts from shore to present a lower profile, pick lures or baits that enter the water with less commotion or downsize them a bit. just a thought"
483167,ironstone74,2010-07-07 13:19:00,201,"Thanks for the feedback guys.  I think the higher water level is the biggest change from last year; however I did see 2 guys in a canoe fishing ""my spot"", haha which may also be a factor.  I'm going to try some more natural presentations and systematically put in right in front of them and see what happens.  I'm counting on that $2ooo from the Grand River Bass Derby!!!!!  Paul"
483236,troutologist,2010-07-07 19:16:00,951,"I always did best on Yum 3-4"" ribbed grubs, motoroil, green pumpkin. Play with a blue, purple or green jighead.  The lightest that will allow bottom contact in a particular run, creep it along the bottom.  I'd get nice fish through the summer, but my big fish all came in the fall. Man I miss that fishing, 5 days a week for a few years I had it dialed right in."
483239,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-07 19:29:00,2690, You caught that in KITCHENER!!!!!!!  Nice!
483241,jediangler,2010-07-07 20:08:00,1923,"Yep Frankie that was caught within Kitchener city limits. The biggest Kitchener grand walleye I've seen before this one was only 19"" and that was in 2008. They are not exactly abundant up in this stretch of the grand."
483255,ch312,2010-07-07 21:06:00,1590,"hmmmm...you guys must have really bad luck if you cant catch any smallies in the grand  ive been fishing the grand in brantford for most of my life (24) and all of the honey holes produce every year. i dont bother going if the water is more than 1 ft higher than normal as the best fishing is when the water is at normal summer levels. i fish everything from knee deep water to deep holes and always find fish quite easily.  top producers for me are spinners, original rapalas, and skitter pops. when im testing new waters or the fish dont wanna play nothing beats drifting a whole worm under a float."
483260,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-07 21:24:00,2690," Figured that was an unusual catch, beautiful walleye...and all the much nicer when it comes as a surprise."
483437,smally21,2010-07-08 13:59:00,993,"i fished the grand above and below the dam in dunnville throughout the year because it is close. while i enjoy it, i never catch anything - ever!  methods tried and true that catch me fish everywhere else yield nothing in that damn river.  i think its because there are no fish!!!"
