482858,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 13:00:00,0," I disagree. I'd say for the most part? They are dishonest. At least in my experiences. I grew up watching my parents get scammed, time, after time, after time because they were immigrants and uneducated. This is why I will not allow anyone to rip me off that easily.  I remember the guy coming to fix the dishwasher 2 times and take money and still was broken and after refused to come back and fix it. Window company installed windows screwed them up and then went bankrupt and probably opened up under another name. Sold a lemon car and again, went bankrupt the next week. Bought a brand new garage door opener, company went out of business, had two DIFFERENT guys come to look at it and both told me it was toast and that I would have to install a new one. With a screw driver and some electrical tape and an hour later? I fixed it myself. So much for the unit being toast. Same thing with my furnace motor. Now if I start talking about mechanics, I'll be typing forever. Not to say that there are no honest mechanics, but there are more dishonest than honest.  Not to mention all the business people doing illegal stuff on the side.  And of course employees rip off owners,but insurance covers that stuff. What protects the consumer from getting ripped off? Small claims courts, but make sure you have your I's and T's crossed and the money for a good lawyer. Plus the small claims court route is too complicated with too much running around to do and papers to fill and fees to pay.  Not to mention my friend got robbed by direct energy and have been trying to find the number for the better business bereau(sp?). Apparently, its always busy!"
482862,anonymous,2010-07-06 13:33:00,58,"So what you are saying is that because you no longer get to keep a percentage of the tax you collect it is costing you money? Doing your accounting is all part of running a business. Saying that you don't get to keep money which really was never yours is bogus. It's not going to ""cost"" you $1500 more next year, you are losing a perk and that is it. That $1500 was a bonus and nothing more, and to lose that is not costing you money, it's lowering your bonus. But I am sure you will pass that onto the paying customer in the end. The sense of entitlement people have these days is something else..."
482867,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-06 13:54:00,0," How can this small business owner say he didn't get anything from the G.S.T if the G.S.T was introduced to help business owners???  And now the business owners are getting a bigger slice of the pie. As opposed to only the G.S.T? Now they get 13% they can claim.  Did they lose a perk or did their perk get improved?  Time to scrap the H.S.T and G.S.T for that mater and if the businesses cant afford to stay in business, they shouldn't be. Not live off the backs of the consumers, as is typical for the rich.  Less taxes equals more money in the hands of consumers, which equates to more consumerism, which equates to more demand, which equates to more jobs, which equates to more profits, which equates to more taxes to the government."

And this is supposed to be nothing? Just on heating and gas alone(which is already over taxed!)will put an extra dent in most people's budget.  I recall my friend stating they were even taxing her on her home phone, or internet now.(can't remember which one). A bit here, a bit there and it all adds up.  I'm sick and tired of the rich justifying their robbery with their theory of trickle down economics. It doesn't work. Give more money to big businesses so they can create jobs, bla bla bla. How about trickle UP economics? Give more money to the ones struggling so they can pick them selves up and become productive citizens. They have more money, they spend more, the companies are happy, the people are happy, the government gets increased tax revenue and everyoine is happy.  This tax just makes the rich richer and the poor, poorer.   Thanks for the number. I will be calling them shortly."

Right now I am arguing with direct energy, who was charging a friend of mine 300 every two months for a one bedroom apartment. Someone is doing some scamming.  A)you get a lawyer(you can afford it)  you right it off as a loss come tax time.  I am a smart shopper. I know how to look for deals. If the price is unreasonable. I wont buy, but when your forced to pay an unreasonable price? Thats when it becomes a problem.  The good experiences I have had with businesses are well established businesses for the most part, that have been in business over 30 years. Although you pay a little more for your product? the company backs their product up 100%.

It was all about planning, saving, investing, and compounding (and having life insurance for some reason). When it should have been about getting rich by dealing only in cash, and not claiming it. My niece and her now husband, put themselves through university (including accommodations) by bar tending and waitressing 2-3 days a week. (no, I don't hate them, and yes, they have lots of hair  ) It may only be $14, but I had to earn close to double that to get the 14. I pay cash for as little as possible for that reason. Jim"

So tell me again how they have to raise their prices to stay open when the gov said it would allow businesses to LOWER the price of their services/products.   On another note, I agree that $14 bucks is not much for a haircut but I see what he is getting at. Anyone that takes cash should be giving out receits if they want to charge tax.  Oh ok. Toronto angler. Basically your telling me that all small businesses are dishonest(which I already know) and that they have to be, to keep the doors open.

But I do get a bit miffed when the barber, that only takes cash and likely only declares enough of his income so that he can write off everything that he has ever purchased, passes on the tax that the government will likely never see, onto me!

481959,Toronto_Angler,2010-07-03 16:13:00,698,14 dollars for a haircut is not a big deal. He's just a small business owner trying to make a living. I'm sure he's not getting wealthy and just trying to support his family.
481960,splashhopper,2010-07-03 16:16:00,2931,$14.00 for a haircut is still a darned good price. Unless of course u have fur toilet set for a hairline

Right off the top next year it’s going to cost me an extra $1500.00 to do business. As a collector of PST we were given 5% of what we collected, up to $1500.00 a year for collecting and remitting the tax. Well that’s now gone with the HST; but we still have the same work in collecting the tax and remitting it. (never did get anything for collecting, tracking and remitting GST) Where else am I going to get this money back other then raising pricing. The government wins all around; they’re not paying anyone for collecting the tax plus they’ll be getting extra tax form the increased pricing. In my opinion all they (the government) are doing is making people think of doing something they haven’t done much of in a long time; black market, under the table dealings. I get asked daily if I’m willing to not write an invoice for my labour and of course I say no; wouldn’t want to defraud the tax man now would I?????  Dan."

482037,Toronto_Angler,2010-07-03 23:48:00,698, I don't care that the government may not see it (False accusation without proof btw). A barber works hard and I think he deserves 14 dollars for his services.  If you are a small business owner you would understand how hard it is to make a go of it and if you followed the rules to a T you wouldnt eat. If you arent a smalll business owner then you wouldn't understand.
482071,grt1,2010-07-04 01:10:00,638,"here's another twist on the hst.  a guy I work with takes a taxi to work every shift. He told me this afternoon that his normal fare from his house to work is $6.50.  today he said the taxi driver told him the fellow was in to adjust the meters in the cabs to reflect the hst and his cost today $9.35  now I thought the hst was to replace the pst and gst into onetax, so if he wasn't paying pst or gst before the most the fare should have gone up would be $.98 , so who's making the extra or are they taxing on top of tax?"
482099,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-04 02:17:00,10439, Actually the fare should have gone up $0.52 as they were already charging GST at 5% so it should have increased another 8% max. But the taxi company being the gougers that they are raised the price 44% and blame it on the gubberment 'cause they think everyone who rides in their cabs is a product of cousins marrying and doesn't know how to figger their numbers.
482105,splashhopper,2010-07-04 02:38:00,2931,"  Yeah, fourteen bucks does seem a little steep ( based on your profile pic)"
482118,John Bacon,2010-07-04 03:40:00,3277," Actually many businesses will see a decrease in their cost of doing business.  For example, prior to July 1st a barber would have had to pay PST on his barber chair, scissors, trimmers, and any other equipment and supplies that they required for their business.  Now these are effectively tax free due to input tax credits.  They should be able to reduce their pretax prices; this does not necessarily decrease the after tax prices."
482135,JohnF,2010-07-04 05:11:00,3494, That's the key point that a lot of folks don't understand. I believe the government is saying it might take as long as 5 years for the system to catch up with the already paid 8% tax which sounds like a handout to business to get them onside from the gitgo. The truth is that many businesses will see it as an opportunity to pad an extra 8% margin into their pricing as long as the government is taking the heat anyway. We asked the minister what the government was doing to pressure the business world to be fair about reflecting the tax savings in the end user pricing. His reply was naive at best.  JF
