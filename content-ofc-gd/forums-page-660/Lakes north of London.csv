Pike/Musky/Walleye would me the preference.  Shoot me a PM if you prefer.  cheers scugog"
483627,Musky or Specks,2010-07-09 02:25:00,2710,Aaron lake is a decent pike fishery.
483630,Twocoda,2010-07-09 02:30:00,4130, Chesley Lake is another ...eyes / perch and bass
483632,Musky or Specks,2010-07-09 02:37:00,2710,Well I didnt want to give him Chelsey Lake might as well give him Gould as well
483634,Twocoda,2010-07-09 02:40:00,4130,i know what ya mean ....but he could probably do better in the river off of the BIG Lake but he didnt ask for rivers...so i wont mention the name of the river
