482543,Spiel,2010-07-05 15:47:00,9065,"As some of you may know I was out on the big lake last Friday evening with a few small fish boated.  Thread here....  http://www.ofncommun...showtopic=45085  Prior to the trip a good friend had asked me to keep any trout/salmon boated under 4lbs for him as he wanted to throw some on the BBQ. ""No problem"" I said, if I get 'em they're yours. I mean how could I not considering he sent me up to Lakair with several pounds of ground moose meat which ended up in a great chilli courtesy of Joey and ChrisK.  Anyhow the gist of it is he came to pick up the fish this past Saturday morning (2 bows and 2 shakers) and handed me another 4/5lbs of ground moose meat. Tonight my son and I are dining on moose meatloaf. Just finished putting it together with some tasting fixin's and the last of the farm fresh eggs courtesy of the Plumma brothers. Mmmmmmm, moose.  Good trade I'd say!"
482569,Headhunter,2010-07-05 16:56:00,5703,"Good trade indeed Spiel! Mmmmmm, bullwinkle meat loaf! HH"
482689,Leecher,2010-07-05 22:07:00,7832,Yeah I'd say that's a good trade
482693,Roy,2010-07-05 22:26:00,13728,"For most it would be a good trade. I like all kinds of game including moose but if I had the choice between the two, I'd go for the salmon or trout. Not frozen...FRESH! But you can still let me know when the meatloaf will be ready."
482701,fish-miester,2010-07-05 22:35:00,864,my go to would be peperets.. Im absolutely addicted to moose peperets !

482718,Spiel,2010-07-05 23:19:00,9065,"Mmmmm, mmmmm. It was really, I mean really good.  Three big slices left."

483044,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-06 23:28:00,10439,"My buddy from BC that came to visit in March brought me a cooler full of Moose (burger,steaks and roasts), Elk (steaks and roasts) and Halibut. Life is good!!!"
483060,Marty,2010-07-07 00:09:00,873,You're eating fresh smuggled eggs?   Crook.
483133,bigugli,2010-07-07 03:05:00,6138,In the words of my good friend.... 
483292,aplumma,2010-07-07 23:16:00,6896,glad to see you finally got some moosie Chris   Art
483294,Spiel,2010-07-07 23:20:00,9065," Hey I ain't no smuggler.     Yep.   Well I had it Art, took three nights for my son and I to eat it all, but it's now gone.   "
483307,Fish Farmer,2010-07-07 23:54:00,2234,"And not even a sniff for the net man.   ""Brook"" pee in the masters shoe."
483310,Leecher,2010-07-08 00:05:00,7832, Here I thought I'd trade you a partridge salad sandwich for one of them slice    Guess not
483641,Stern Rules,2010-07-09 03:01:00,342,That's a fantastic trade. Steaks would be better but any moose is better than none.
483682,Bernie,2010-07-09 11:47:00,3190,I'll trade you some venison for some of that salmon.
483685,Spiel,2010-07-09 11:51:00,9065,  I agree and if my buddy had any roasts or steaks he would have gladly offered them. In fact I have received moose and venison roasts/steaks from him in the past without having to trade anything.    You've already fed me the venison Bernie so I guess I owe you.
