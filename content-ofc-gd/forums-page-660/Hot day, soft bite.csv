And I'm not English Hit some high afternoon bassin after physio today, seeing as the lake was just around the corner. Was it ever hot out there, but the fish were biting and hitting senkos hard. A few samples.   Even the perch wanted senkos. Hook went straight through his head. Dead instantly.  After 2 1/2 hours I had enough. Back home to the A/C and cold beer."

483392,bigugli,2010-07-08 07:27:00,6138,Was fishing a 12' deep break with the senkos. They were sitting at the bottom of it.
483395,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-07-08 08:48:00,1107,Nice smallies but is that a uglystik   and a white bucket
