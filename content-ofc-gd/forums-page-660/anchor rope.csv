483585,shan&jay,2010-07-09 00:50:00,55,i just tied mine on with a bowline but i like the idea of the splice the best
483677,Spiel,2010-07-09 11:31:00,9065,"  Actually Brian to clarify my previous comment, I actually have that 30 year old knot tied to about 4 feet of heavy chain, the chain of course being connected to the anchor.  "
