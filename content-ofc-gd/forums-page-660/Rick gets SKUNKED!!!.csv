483384,bigfish1965,2010-07-08 03:44:00,3382,He was a semi-tamed skunk. Very docile. Let me take lots of pics. No real smell to it other than the musk associated with similar animals. He almost raised his tail once...I was ready to move..lol. My dog could smell it on me and was NOT happy.
483398,Daplumma,2010-07-08 10:13:00,1961,Now you have done it.How will you ever get the smell off.....of the skunk.Pretty cool but they still stink even when not spraying. Joe
