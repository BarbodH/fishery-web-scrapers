483608,Bernie,2010-07-09 02:02:00,3190,"Hi gang. On vacation this week and been out a couple times and catching a few, no skunks. After supper Karen suggested we go out for a while. I hesitated, thinking after the storm went through that the bite would be off. But the lake was calm and would be a pleasant evening on the water. I picked one off on the first cast, missed one on the second one. But Karen tied into one, her biggest ever actually, in only a few minutes. Just shy of 26 inches.    Then a couple of casts later she gets one in the slot, back it went.    She lost one at the boat a couple minutes later but picked off one more before we left. We headed home after an hour with 4 pickerel.    The osprey was waiting for the leftovers.    All in all a very fine evening."

483646,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-09 03:13:00,2050,"Oh man I miss fishin for small water eyes! Living next to lake Erie and having a small boat doesn't offer many opportunities for walleye fishing!  Thanks for taking the time to post!  Enjoy your holidays!  Cheers, Ryan"
483675,Bernie,2010-07-09 11:28:00,3190,"Thanks guys.  Gerritt, we fished that same spot in May a few times. No need to mark it. 27 feet of water. We got a few earlier in the week in close to 40 ft. I also heard guys have been catching them in 6 ft in Fish Bay. Strange.  O ya....Joe, no sheephead were caught."
483676,Spiel,2010-07-09 11:28:00,9065,"Nicely done Bernie, looks like the makings of some fine eating there."

483745,fishnsled,2010-07-09 14:10:00,3520,"Hey Bernie!  Nice too see you and the misses spending some time on the water. I have to wonder though if that one just shy of 26"" was the same fish that Joe released the last time we were up there? Thanks for the report."
483761,discophish,2010-07-09 14:51:00,392,Are you sure the Osprey wasn't hunting you and not the fish?  They are pretty big birds with sharp beaks.  Good job with the Pickerel!
