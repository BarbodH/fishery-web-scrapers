483691,mike hagan,2010-07-09 12:10:00,50,"Just picked up a new spinning reel fro BPS and noticed the gear ratio of 4.7-1 This is a slower reel than i usually use,and not sure what you you match it up with rod and bait. Any help?"
483802,Gregoire,2010-07-09 16:52:00,1397,"I know with baitcast reels a lower gear ratios are meant for cranking. So I would guess a crankbait rod and some crankbaits would be a good match. Shimano has a crucial spinning rod that is crankbait specific. I could be entirely wrong on this, if I am I'm sure someone will correct me soon."
483850,bassjnkie,2010-07-09 19:31:00,1101,I have the same reel (1500) and use it for small crankbaits. I paired it with a 6' Med/Lite.
