The wife had a wooden leg and to insure it in Ontario was $2000.00 a year! When they  arrived in Newfoundland, they went to an Insurance agency to see how much  it would cost to insure the wooden leg. The agent looked it up on the  computer and said to the couple, '$39.00.'  The husband was shocked and  asked why it was so cheap here in Newfoundland To insure, because it cost him  $2000.00 in Ontario!  The agent turned his computer screen to the  couple and said, 'Well, here it Is on the screen,it  says:  *Any wooden structure, with a sprinkler system over it, is  $39.00.*    I always did find the Newfoundland Logic far superior to  most others."
