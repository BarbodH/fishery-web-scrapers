Havent been on in a few days cause where I am there is no internet so a few times a week ill try to get on here at the restaurant and say hello and comment on some posts. Here is a beauty near 5lb Largie I caught last night on a frog, and also a giant bowfin that gave me one heck of a fight in the weeds!  7 1/2lb bowfin   Nice long skinny bass   And a surprise slop pike haha   The fishing here has been tough, been trying to find bass shallow under the duckweed all afternoon with only a few 1.5-2lb largies blowing up on frogs. The evening bite in the duckweed is good but still no massive fish mostly 2lb class fish."
482638,Dutchy,2010-07-05 19:58:00,416,Very nice. I have to do more top water and slop fishing this year for sure.

482694,OhioFisherman,2010-07-05 22:28:00,6623,"Nice fish Mike, bowfin may be not one of the more sought after fish, but they do give a heck of a fight.  More info on them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowfin buddy got one on the Georgian one time when we were up there pushing 20 pounds, got it in deeper weeds 16-18 feet in an area where he had caught a 31 inch walleye the day before. Disappointment when it wasn`t s bigger wally."
482723,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-05 23:45:00,0,Bowfin are great to catch. Geo bay and all bodies of water connected to it are polluted with them. I've caught tons on Simcoe and the holland river.  That is one sweet bass!
482726,kerr,2010-07-05 23:52:00,77,"lots of bowfin on the rideau system here north of kingston, my biggest is 10 lbs. i got one on a popular rideau lake and an identical twin in the evergl,ades just oustdise of fort lauderdale, awesome fight each time with one of them almost snapping my rod in two, good report man  keep em coming"
482824,EC1,2010-07-06 05:35:00,930,Nice fish dude!
482827,Cudz,2010-07-06 07:30:00,2652,Nice job Mike.  That 5 lb largie would easily be a 6+ in the fall.
482968,Fishing 24/7,2010-07-06 19:49:00,709,that 5 lbs largie looks anarexic...
483169,Fisherpete,2010-07-07 13:26:00,1814,You can lip a bowfin... once... then you can do it with the other hand... once... and then you can go shopping for new thumbs!
483425,MCTFisher9120,2010-07-08 13:18:00,3761,Thanks for the reply's guys. The frog bite was slow these past 2 days but I managed to get them on a spinnerbait. Nothing big but some chunky largies and smallies I caught.  Also nailed this beauty Pike this morning on a snag proof frog! Was awesome to see it hit at the boat
483458,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-08 15:37:00,947,AWESOME FISH.  I STILL CAN'T COME TO GRASP WITH TOUCHING A BOWFIN
