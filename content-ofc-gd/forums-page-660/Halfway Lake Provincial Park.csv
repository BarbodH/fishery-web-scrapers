A year ago it would have been my trusty abu spincast rod and reel and whatever tackle I could string together.  Now I seem to have 3 baitcast setups with another on the way ((I got a good deal on a revo toro from ebay). Was wondering what to bring. I am going to bring some bass stuff, and want to experiment with drop shotting.  Should I bother packing Musky gear or not? We plan on renting a boat, if that helps.   Greg"
483419,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-08 12:44:00,2690,Was up there about 12 years ago (before the tornado went through it) a really beautiful park at that time.  Pretty sure there are no muskies in the parks lakes though...correct me if I'm wrong guys/gals. Lots of pike and (according to another board member) decent bass fishing as well.  Have an awesome time up there!!
483522,Gregoire,2010-07-08 19:54:00,1397,Thanks for getting back to me. I was thinking of bringing the musky gear for large northerns. Not sure if it is worth it as I will be packing light.

Only one lake in the park accesible by vehicle and no boat rentals available for that lake that I know of although canoes might be available, but i don't recall. It's a small lake ok for sm bass I guess. I would say muskies are a stretch.  Most people camp there and drive further north to fish the other lakes for pics and trout also sm bass. I dont know about boat rental, I imagine just east of the park, Onaping lake has a tourist resort or two for boat rentals."
483586,Gregoire,2010-07-09 00:58:00,1397,Thanks for the info. I'll post a report when I get back. Hopefully I'll find a boat to rent.
483612,zeeter,2010-07-09 02:08:00,92,"Hi,  I've spent a lot of time as a kid at Halfway Lake.  There are no muskie in Halfway Lake, there may be in Onaping Lake if I remember correctly.  Halfway is okay for smallmouth and if you troll the shorelines you can get some pike.  It's an average fishing lake.  Onaping Lake is very close and worth checking out (has walleye).  They have boat rentals.  Also, pick-up a topo map and try out some of the surrounding lakes.  Hope that helps."

483667,wormdunker,2010-07-09 09:22:00,1711,"I've been fishing that area for 4 years - just north of the park there are lots of smaller lakes.  We were there the July 1st holiday week end.  Did great with the walleye, pike & perch.  There are no musky or bass in our lake.  Small worm harnesses are the key bait for eyes & pike.  Perch were even taking our harnesses while trolling!!  While camping there was a forest fire 1 mile south of us.  MNR helicopter & water bomber were on site within minutes.  Amazing watching the bomber pick up water then disperse it over the fire!!"
