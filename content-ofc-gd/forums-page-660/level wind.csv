483456,tonyb,2010-07-08 15:34:00,1637,"Al, I am not sure what your budget is for the new reel.  However, I would suggest that you seriously consider the new Daiwa Saltist High-speed reels.  The larger size can retrieve almost 4 feet of line in a single handle rotation!  They retail for around $249  That makes it very useful for those rigger hits when your rod tip just points straight at sky, or when an angry salmon is charging at the boat.  Being able to quickly pickup the line and as a result keeping the tension on the fish will result in a higher catch percentage.  http://daiwa.com/Ree...ail.aspx?ID=504  Other quality reels that are a bit cheaper are the Rapala Hydros ($159 retail) and Okuma Catalina ($169 retail), although they are not as quick at retrieving line.  Stick with the all-metal body construction if you can afford it, they are ideal for salmon.  Tony"
