483121,BillM,2010-07-07 02:35:00,17367," I much prefer the barren ugliness of the current dirt hole then say a nice green space.  .....oh wait..... we already had the greenspace!!!!  I'd love to strangle the people that though destroying that park was a good idea..  It's been what, 2-3 years and it still sits there and looks like crap?"
483131,Cudz,2010-07-07 02:58:00,2652,Are you talking about the fairgrounds off Essa or Park Place the old Molson Park?  I think you are talking about that.  Yeah that blows. I am talking about the Barrie Fairgrounds right at the Essa Rd exit (the horse race track)
483156,Fisherman,2010-07-07 10:54:00,7201,Start the car..Start the car..
483202,misfish,2010-07-07 16:38:00,29133,"Yea,Molson park DISTROYED FOR WHAT????????  cabela's is coming,you heard it here first."
483263,BillM,2010-07-07 21:28:00,17367,"  Ah yeah, I always get those two mixed up (the names at least)..  Cabelas at the old fairgrounds would be awesome, but if you think that intersection at Essa/400 is bad now, lol.."
481991,kickingfrog,2010-07-03 19:05:00,8333,Not sure if this has been posted here before or not?  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2652110   http://images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/100331_MEC_Barrie_Store_PR_v1_m56577569830953438.pdf
481994,BillM,2010-07-03 19:33:00,17367,Sweet!!!  A few blocks away
482043,misfish,2010-07-04 00:01:00,29133,Wonder what Sorjurns (sp) thinks of this???????
482060,BillM,2010-07-04 00:34:00,17367, You mean they might have to be competitive with their prices?  Oh the horror!
482308,misfish,2010-07-04 19:22:00,29133,  I was reffering to the fact that another bigbox store taking away from a small store.
482309,BillM,2010-07-04 19:30:00,17367," I dunno if I'd call MEC a 'big box store' It's run a bit differently then you average Walmart for example.  I'm sure Sojourns loyal customers also won't be going anywhere.  They have some great stuff, but unless you are buying something during a wicked sale, you're paying way to much."
482319,Radnine,2010-07-04 20:11:00,1538,You guys will like MEC when it gets there. I am a member at the one in Burlington. I love their home brands and the fact that there is some Canadian content to be had. Jim
482321,Cudz,2010-07-04 20:21:00,2652,I will be able to get there in 3 minutes.  Only Brian might be closer but that is up for argument.
482327,misfish,2010-07-04 20:31:00,29133, Bump drafting is your only hope.
482329,ctranter,2010-07-04 20:39:00,543,"I love the variety and specialization of MEC, but I find the prices too high to justify most purchases.  For things like clothing, I don't really care if my cotton is organic or not.  I did however snag a nice GPS unit on sale for 40% off not long ago, which I use all the time.  Also, if you are looking for a quality head lamp, I cant think of any place better to find it."
482334,BillM,2010-07-04 20:51:00,17367,"I'm like 3 blocks away from the new store, both you guys will be eating my dust!!!!"
482335,misfish,2010-07-04 20:55:00,29133," It,s down hill from here, and a quick right then a left.LOL"
482360,BillM,2010-07-04 22:13:00,17367, I make one turn onto Ardagh and it's a straight shot for me
482449,Cudz,2010-07-05 02:58:00,2652,Me too.  I live off Ardagh as well.  We must live pretty close to each other.
482474,Fisherman,2010-07-05 10:48:00,7201,"Okay what is this, the 3 Barrie Musketeers arguing who's closer, anyway, looked at some of the on line prices, unlikely I'll leave any money there."
482485,BillM,2010-07-05 12:06:00,17367, I'm extremely close to the fire station just west of Ardagh/Ferndale.
482488,danbouck,2010-07-05 12:17:00,4380,I wasn't impressed when I went to the one in Burlington.
482600,jayess,2010-07-05 18:11:00,187,"fwiw, the store in burlington is much smaller than other locations.  mec is far from a ""big box"" store, at last the type of store that i refer to by that label. i won't go on about it, but the community feel and amount of say that each and every member has is really nice.  i don't admire their organic cotton. but the prices on their down-filled items and merino wool base layers are great. i also can't think of a better place to buy one's first down-filled sleeping bag. their prizes are hard to beat. tents are well-built as well... gah, i am a MEC junkie"
482625,Fang,2010-07-05 19:33:00,1330,I find the same stuff at Hikers Haven. LeBarons and some other Toronto stores like Tent City at much more reasonable prices. Last time I was in there I saw some very neat stuff but nothing I would buy for my day to day needs in the outdoors.
482667,ColdH20guy,2010-07-05 21:21:00,312,how about a Cabela's right beside it and we would be all set....
482691,Cudz,2010-07-05 22:17:00,2652,me too ish.
482692,Fisherman,2010-07-05 22:19:00,7201,"Oh ya, that would make my day.."
483097,Cudz,2010-07-07 01:50:00,2652,How about this move? The vacant land that was the fairground is going to be made into shopping of some kind.  How about a cabela's attached to an ikea.  Everyone in the family would be happy.
483101,Rizzo,2010-07-07 01:55:00,4754,I am so out of the loop. What the heck is Mec??
