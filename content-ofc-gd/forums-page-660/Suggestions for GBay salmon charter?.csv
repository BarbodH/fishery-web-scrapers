483561,Twocoda,2010-07-08 22:53:00,4130, Stan ...step on over to Lake  Huron and talk with Rick....heres his website http://64.177.125.54/index.html  Outstanding operation with the same passion....there is a reason he has sooooooo many repeat cutomers  Cheers

Thank you to Fisherman and Pigeontroller too for your info as well, however, I'd prefer salmon from L Huron or GBay over Lake O for the dinner table with the kids. Just personal preference.  Thanks everyone so far for the info.  Stan"
