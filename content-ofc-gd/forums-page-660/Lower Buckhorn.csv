Bringing the whole family which will be loads of fun!!! my fishing time will limited to early morning and some evenings.  I never fished the lake before, so I was wondering if anyone can give me some tips?  I want to try for a muskie and I'm not to worried about the bass as I'm sure that I can find them.  As for walleye a little insight on them would be great (what to look for) I normally don't fish the Kawartha's.  Not looking for hot spots just some general direction....  Thanks,  Peps"
