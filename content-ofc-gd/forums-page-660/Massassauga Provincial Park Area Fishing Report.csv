The boat's motor was having trouble and there was tons of family and kids meaning time spent on the water wasn't as ample as I would have preferred.  The first morning we fished only 3 hrs on a 12ft tinny with nothing but a trolling motor and managed 3 pike in the 25-28"" region.  The first pike pulled a hit and run on the Koppers LIVETARGET smelt.  I did a follow-up cast and boated him.  The same fish hit again 4 casts later.  I requested an early return to shore since the previous night's drink was working overtime on me.  The next morning we rented a 16 footer and had 4 of us in it.  All fishing bass baits and none to show for it.  3 pike around 26"" were boated on spinnerbaits and a little perch too over a 5 hr period.  All fish caught in 8-10ft of water near shore.  I'll add some pics as soon as they get sent to me.  No broken rods or lost lures on this trip, BONUS!  2 weekends from now will be my inaugural trip to Rice Lake and will rent a boat from one of the many recommended places from you gents.  Can't wait.  Happy fishin' Rigged  "

483338,TDunn,2010-07-08 01:21:00,680,Great pics! How did you do on the bow? I'll be out there in a week and a half and plan to fish a bit.   TDunn

We fished jigs on spinners and some flies provided by a rookie fly-fisher, so we didn't match any hatch.  There were some more experience guys on the water who said it's been real tough times as it's very over-fished, being one of the few major bodies of water so close to Calgary.  If you have a down-day try the 3+ hour tube ride down the bow into the city, that was wicked.  Sorry I couldn't be more of a help on this, it was one of my first times out in years and I didn't gain any lasting knowledge on how to fish it.  Let me know how you do and what works for my next trip out there though.  Cheers  "
