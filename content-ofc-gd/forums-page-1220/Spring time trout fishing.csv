Does anyone have any recommendations on where we should go?  We are looking for a public camping (tents) with small motorized fishing boats and looking for a place within 2-3 hrs of Ottawa.  We have been going to Wendigo Lake.   Had mixed success there.  We are going 1 week later than usual this year.  As well any reports on the black flies up there?   We haven't encountered any bugs during the first weekend of May.   Fearing the 2nd weekend!!!"

I dont know anything about trout north of Algonquin Park, but there was a thread here recently about black flies being really bad in the Kawarthas this past weekend.  Checking The Weather Network site, for North Bay, they are saying Blackflies are in the ""High"" index right now....

68862,Pizzinato,2007-05-07 23:00:00,6,Well thank you for replying ...  I haven't been on the forums before so not sure of the protocol!  That bug report was very interesting.  I would love to know how they can project the future but it does let me know that I better prepare.  I am going fishing with 3 other guys .. we have 2 aluminum boats.   We have gone to Wendigo Lake for the past two years .. it is just north of Algonquin Park.   You can walk a few feet and be in the park at Allen Lake  We have not caught a ton of fish there but there are people that fish the lake a lot (one group for the past 25 years or so).   I have been quite frustrated because we don't catch a lot and what we do catch is in the slot where we have to release them.  We have caught Lake Trout and Speckled Trout there.  We are looking for another place to try.   We want to use a motorized boat and we would like to camp in tents.  I am coming from Kingston and two of the guys are coming from Ottawa.  We are not very experienced trout fishermen.   We normally fish for walleye and bass.
68962,Jacques,2007-05-08 01:21:00,97,Sorry I can't give you any fishing advice on this -- I've not fished that area.  However I will reiterate what Cliff said -- pack the bug spray or bring face nets.  I hiked Algonquin that weekend a few years ago and they were pretty bad.  I hit the bush in Sudbury today and they were out in full force -- thankfully there was a strong wind to keep them at bay.  Have a great time -- I'm sure someone will pipe up with someone advice!
69074,Pizzinato,2007-05-08 12:28:00,6,So does DEET work with Black Flies?  I have never really had to deal with them.   So are there no trout fishermen from Ottawa that know the surrounding area?   I am desperate for a good spot for camping/trout fishing!
