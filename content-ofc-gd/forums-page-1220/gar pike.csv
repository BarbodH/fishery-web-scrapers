68937,Dondorfish,2007-05-08 00:35:00,1000,Nice fish - I've never caught one before. Do they fight like regular pike? Did you catch them down Windsor way? ( no gps waypoints please! )  Don
68944,FinS,2007-05-08 00:40:00,463,they fight similar to a pike yes i caught them down here a place called lighthouse cove
68945,Joey,2007-05-08 00:41:00,9122,Neat!!!.  Does it smell aweful like everyone says they do?  Joey
68947,FinS,2007-05-08 00:42:00,463,they stank lol
68948,Dondorfish,2007-05-08 00:44:00,1000,Read somewhere ( probably here ) that a good way to catch them is with yarn. It raps around their teeth and the can't get loose. Ever heard of this method? How big do they get in your area?   Don
68950,solopaddler,2007-05-08 00:45:00,8605,Cool looking fish!
68954,FinS,2007-05-08 00:47:00,463, ya yarn works well but i like it when they bite the hook ive seen some up to 8lbs get caught here
68955,Rich Clemens,2007-05-08 01:01:00,3131,Cool pic.  I don't see many of those.
68957,xrap,2007-05-08 01:11:00,683,Neat fish to catch. I caught alot of them on the grand river on a minnow and bobber. And a few on topwater lures. I remeber fishing the old mill at Caledonia and there would always be a crap load of them spawning thier and some of them were over 10lbs easy.
68976,Greencoachdog,2007-05-08 01:54:00,8163,"Actually it's a piece of unraveled nylon rope that catches them best... no hook!  The three words that describe Gar the best are... and I quote!... ""Stink"", ""Stank"", ""Stunk""!!!"
68995,007,2007-05-08 02:36:00,537,Wow what an amazing looking fish.  Would love to catch one of those.  Those and Bowfin sure are prehistoric looking.  Thanks for sharing the pic. 007
69017,OhioFisherman,2007-05-08 03:26:00,6623,"Georgian Bay has some big ones 40 + inches, they don`t fight as well as a pike the same size."
69075,b2kptbo,2007-05-08 12:31:00,1505,"Nice, cool fish..."
69076,kickingfrog,2007-05-08 12:33:00,8333,"Nice. Haven't caught one yet, but when I did some spring trap netting with the MNR out of Matchadash(?) Bay we would usually get a few in the nets.   Rob"
69078,Mike the Pike,2007-05-08 12:45:00,3421,I only ever caught one.This was caught in the Lachine Rapids in Montreal.I didn't hook it the line was tangled around its mouth.It's not as slimy as a Pike it feels more like a snake.    MTP
69087,1leggedangler,2007-05-08 13:28:00,364,"Nice gar! I landed a couple of those critters bass fishing down in Florida. Thanks for the report.  Cheers, 1leg"
69111,TJQ,2007-05-08 14:54:00,7806,Those are my favourite kind of fish.. i kept one in the aquarium for over two years till it got too big and we released it..
69120,snag,2007-05-08 15:12:00,1932,Beautiful!  I think they are awesome fish.
69132,Pizzinato,2007-05-08 15:57:00,6,I was in Florida in March and saw a 100 or more Gar crusin' through the bass fry.   Some of them were monsters too.  I never caught any bud I did take a pic of one in the water.
