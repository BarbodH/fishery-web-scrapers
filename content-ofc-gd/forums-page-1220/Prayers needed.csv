We found out today, after being there last week, he will need to have surgery Monday. So far, it will just be day surgery and a biopsy, so he gets to come home that day..... Right now all we know is he has a growth in the nasal/sinus passage, which is bleeding down into his lungs. As a small child he had to have all of that area reconstructed due to damage from birth process.  Right now I am trying to be supportive and tell him we can only take one day at a time.... Only God knows what tomorrow will bring.....  Thanx, I will let you know what happens.... Lorissa"
