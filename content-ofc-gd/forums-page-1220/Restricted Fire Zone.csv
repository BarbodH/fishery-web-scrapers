69151,grt1,2007-05-08 17:12:00,638,A restricted fire zone went into effect last night at midnight for Northwestern Ontario. This was due to a large number of man-made fire starts over the weekend. The Kenora newspaper reported 21 new fires over the weekend and with opening of the walleye season on the 3rd saturday the MNR want to keep it fire free. The bush up here is tinder dry.

69177,irishfield,2007-05-08 18:35:00,26272,"Thanks GRT. I posted about Muskoka yesterday, with no replies, and wondered how far North the zone went. No fires for even cooking and warmth and I wanted to warn those heading out this weekend...as knew many were headed for Algonquin.  Guess I won't be burnin my reno rip outs next week on the island."
