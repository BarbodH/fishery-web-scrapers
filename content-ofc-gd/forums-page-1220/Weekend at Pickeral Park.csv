Thats just too funny.,  We were looking for a launch on Hays Bay drove around Sat evening (lost) looking for a place then saw the sign for pickeral park..  We ended up ""last minute"" camping for the night there and launching We must have past you about 10 times, on the water, and walked past you guys a few times...  I even has the OFC flag fluttering on my boat.. Oh well maybe next.  Looks like you guys had a super time. congrats."
69286,Jen,2007-05-08 23:55:00,833,Where do you get an OFC flag?    Always next time for introductions...  Cheers  Jen

68511,Jen,2007-05-07 02:08:00,833,"Friday morning departure time was to be 10:00am, however Sonny and I ran out of patience and headed out before Easton, his dad Ike and friend Jerry.  First Stop   Finally we are getting close,    One more quick stop at Carrara's    Had the pleasure of meeting Sam,    And finally, Pickeral Park...    Quick stop at the store to pick up our tickets and free hats and off we go to get Eastons family set up for the season.    Unpacked, opened two trailers, ate and then a walk down to the docks to enjoy the evening sunset    Just as we were settling in for a long wait till midnight, Mike the Pike and Percher (Dan) showed up     Percher, Mike the Pike, Jen, Easton and Sonny.  It was an awesome evening of never ending stories.  Great meetin you Mike and Dan.     First fish of the day , although I have to admit to being on the dock right after midnight with Easton for hours with not a bite between us, while Sonny and Jerry headed out on the water in the boat.     Sonny and Jerry, frozen and tired coming in to weigh in their fish. Bright and early Saturday morning     Quick picture of their fish in the live well and then off to the weigh stations     Easton helps out    Sonny and his catch (someone else is going to have to post sizes lengths and weights as at the moment I can not recall)    My very first Walleye ever...    Now exhaustion has set in after getting up at 5:00am to hit the water, fishing till well into the afternoon, even though there were 3 - 4 foot waves at times, we decide to call it a day    Early Sunday morning first catch of the day    Then Sonny caught this, amazing fight but not the winning Walleye    And then this 32"" pike hit Sonny's line, although this is the only picture we have.  It was handed over at the weigh scales and for some reason  no more pictures were taken.     Easton was out with his father and Jerry and managed to bring in this 35"" pike.    Then it is time to pack up and head home.  Last we heard the leading fish in the Walleye category was 13.5 (est) lbs caught by someone at Pickeral Park but weighed in at another station    All and all the weekend was filled with many memorable fishing moments, from candles for ambiance in the boat to good people getting together for a lot of laughs.  It was great to meet our fellow members from the board Sam, Dan and Mike!  I will say thanks to Easton and his family for inviting us, as well as putting up with all the antics and bad jokes and  thanks to my Brother for putting up with my constant ramblings...both in person and over the marine radio.  Last but not least a beautiful moment!  If you look close you can see it.    Cheers,  Jen"

68655,easton13th,2007-05-07 14:46:00,371,"What an amazing weekend! Do not remember the last time I had such a great time on and off the water! I met my goal of getting Jen her first walleye. We fished a lot of water. With the waves we tried several spots until we hit the right area. Small troubles with the boat threatened the weekend BUT we overcame the trouble and carried on. (check valve in gas can could not get prime I guess it is sticking).  Cool weather, lots of wind.  There were not quantities of fish but the ones caught sure were quality....  Thanks to My Dad, Jerry, Sonny and Jen for sharing it with me. Also thanks to Mike the Pike and Percher for visiting.  Easton."
