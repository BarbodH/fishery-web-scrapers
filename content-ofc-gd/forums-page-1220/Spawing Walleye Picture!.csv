68442,Slayingm,2007-05-07 00:10:00,204,While spending a few days up in the Haliburton's fishing for Rainbow and Brook trout I stopped by a couple of small rivers and was able to see first hand some really nice Walleye heading up the rivers for the spring spawning ritual.  Here is one of many pictures I took.... this one is cool as it shows both a male and female Walleye beside each other!  You just got to love the spring time!    The trout fishing was great also.... here is a couple of beauti Rainbow's taken while trolling a spinner and woolly bugger combo.    Take care and good Fish'n.... Greg.

68502,jediangler,2007-05-07 01:52:00,1923,Those rainbows look like they are in the bottom of a Sportspal canoe. Am I right? Nice walleye pics too by the way.
68503,douG,2007-05-07 01:52:00,2693,"You see the pope too?  That's great, I thought I was nuts.  That's a huge relief right there.  On the other hand, I'm a very, very lucky guy and fortunate too.  This is all because my wife pretty much sorta sees the pope in the photo also.  You gotta count your blessings."

Cool pics Greg, thanks for the post, makes me wish I was out fishing instead of working.  Stan"
