68416,ishingchippy,2007-05-06 22:51:00,33,"I loaded up the kids, the tackle, chairs blah blah and the worms I had picked up in Orillia yesterday, while we were there for the perch festival.  Thought I would take them over to Milne Dam for some fishing again on this lovely day.  As always stopped in at Timmy's for some snacks to take with us and much to my delight I notice there is a brand new bait shop!!!  Right there at McCowan and Hwy 7 on the south west corner (the same plaza that has the McDonald's and Blockbuster Video)  I couldn't believe it.  I actually just stuck my head in thinking I might have had a total newfie moment never knowing it was there and said to the guy, ""How long have you been here?""  He replies ""Only a week!"" Phew.....no newfie moment hahahaha  So anyways it's right there, Joe's Bait and Tackle, right next door to the convenience store.  Worms and all.  Small but still nice to have locally  :thumbsup_anim:  :clapping:"
68419,Gerritt,2007-05-06 22:57:00,6129,"Awesome I work on Hwy 7... nice  and close should I happen to bring my rod to work, should I feel ""ill"" LOL... thanks for the heads up!   Gerritt."
68420,98Fahrenheit,2007-05-06 22:57:00,108,"I only go to this tackle store and I live in Markham.  Since I go on the 401 a lot ... it's actually more convenient:  AV Fishing Tackle 4830 Sheppard Av. E., Scarborough ON M1S5M9 Tel: (416) 293-8228  Location: ONE Traffic light east of McCowan Rd. on the North side of Sheppard Av. E. in the Tim Horton's Plaza (@ Shorting Rd.)  http://www.yellowpages.ca/mp/ON/null/A%2BV...0056345007.html"
68422,ishingchippy,2007-05-06 23:04:00,33,"LOL.......it's wasn't some major plug, well okay a little one.  I'd rather go just to McCowan and 7 seeing how I live right 2 minutes away, as I also know some other OFNers live right here on the Markham/Unionville border.  No doubt for the really nice stuff I'm going to hit BPS, crappie tire or hell even walmart sometimes.  buuuuuuttt......BAIT close by lol.......when you only have a couple of hours an evening to fish nice to have something finally close by  I will make sure to check out that other place when I'm in that area for sure"
68424,jdmls,2007-05-06 23:17:00,575,Did you catch anything at Milne Dam ?????
68425,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-06 23:17:00,1351,"do you guys know the open hours for the new joe's bait? and same with av? i think av was 24hrs, but i don't want to show up there and find out its not..."
68426,ishingchippy,2007-05-06 23:22:00,33,"Nope, we fished for 4 hours and caught nothing   Between my sister, myself and the kids yesterday at the festival I was the only one that caught any perch so I was hoping just to take the kids there for anything.  My patient 4 year old daughter has been fishing 20 times now in her life and still never caught anything.  LOL I'm getting more annoyed then her.  I just want the kid to catch something for pete's sake.  Oh and we were in a bit of a hurry to get out fishing so I didn't think to check it out.  I plan on popping in there quickly to check it out tomorrow before some carp fishing.  I'll post any hours then."
68525,Crazyhook,2007-05-07 02:23:00,1154,"damn I was there this weekend!  had a great time fishing and went 0 for 1 on steelhead, saw a few fish which was really cool. Hooked one fish on the fly"
69023,wolfville,2007-05-08 03:35:00,396,So close to where I live. Thanks for the good news. Guess I might run into you there next time instead of Walmart ;-)
69042,Photoz,2007-05-08 09:29:00,792,"I don't know if you are aware that over at Woodbine & #7 there's Lebarons, likely the best stocked tackle shop east of #400 Highway. (Best prices too, and since BPS opened, service has improved noticeably here!) South one light, east side of Woodbine, beside the big Costco store."
69056,ishingchippy,2007-05-08 11:27:00,33,"No doubt wolfville............. still starting the think all the carp in toogood is an urban legend.    Was there again last night  I haven't even had a chance to pop in there yet and look around.  LeBaron's that is.  I did know it was there but like I said Joe's is still a very close place for live bait when you only have a short time to fish in the evenings.  I stopped in last night to finally get a looky around.  It's a tiny place but Joe is very friendly and also offering 10% off until May 26th.  First month opening sale.  I did manage to jot down the hours as requested.  Monday's - 10am - 9pm Tuesday's - Friday's - 7am - 9pm Saturday's 5am - 9pm Sunday's 5am - 6pm  The exact address is 8312 McCowan Road, Unit 1-D, Markham, Ontario 905-415-2248"
