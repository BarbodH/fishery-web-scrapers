68800,glen,2007-05-07 20:29:00,2641,My manual calls for a boat battery that is 12v 35ah.  I bought a  275cca 335ca.  Is my new battery big enough?  Thanks for any help.
68801,Uncle Buck,2007-05-07 20:36:00,1000,"not sure though... i think if it's 35ah, then it's a gell cell battery the kind they use in fishflashers however the 35ah, seems high?  This i'm sure... if you're using it to start the motor, the bigger the cca/ca, the better it is... for that you'll want a marine cranking battery if using it for a trolling motor, then get a deepcycle, then the more reserve minutes, the better it is...  I bought a 1050 marine ca battery for $65 from Acme Battery in Hamilton. I think for piece of mind if the battery you have will work, get a bigger one, better safe then sorry, mind you my motor is 150HP, and there aint no way i'd be able to pull start it... so i went big with the battery."
68803,glen,2007-05-07 20:44:00,2641,Thanks Uncle Buck.  I have a 20hp with a pull start if i have to.  I will only use the battery for fishfinder bilge pump lights.  I have other battery packs for the trolling motor.
