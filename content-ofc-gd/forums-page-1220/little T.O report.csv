68524,ehg,2007-05-07 02:22:00,2666,"Had a few hours to fish this morning so tried the Toronto islands for pike. Thought i'd catch the 9 o'clock ferry to islands but got blocked by closures on Lakeshore for a huge amount of people running. Finally after driving for a bit i was able to get parking and to the islands an hour later.  Sure was chilly with a brisk wind by the lake. Went to the finger docks of Center island and threw an assortment of X-raps and Husky Jerks and had some follows and short strikes (flashes) from fish that probably ranged from 15-35 inches in length so i was encouraged.  Finally hit a fish after about an hour on a bl/slv/org HJ-10. This was the result.  Nice little 29.5 inch pike entry for team 9. Fished another hour or so had some more follows on a #5 silver BlueFox spinner.  So i spent from 10:30 am to 12:30 in afternoon at prime pike spot on islands on opening weekend and saw one other group of two anglers go by this area. So much for the hoopla about lurkers and sensitive areas, blurring backgrounds and such. The pike are alright.  Obligatory Toronto skyline pic.   cheers, ehg"
68559,007,2007-05-07 03:22:00,537,Nice pike there ehg! Good job. You did better in 2 hours than I did in 5 hours on Saturday.  I better get out there and try harder! LOL  007
68678,ehg,2007-05-07 15:23:00,2666,"Hey 007, most fish followed from fairly shallow water. Flashy blades of the spinner got there attention but no takers. Even used the deep diving X-rap in spots since there is little weed growth currently.  cheers,  ehg"
68680,ccmtcanada,2007-05-07 15:25:00,7971,Hey...great looking Pike there!!!!  Good to see some of those toothy critters being landed.  I'll have to try for them soon.  BTW...the skyline pic looks like a postcard...great pic!

68832,RobHall,2007-05-07 21:56:00,261," Nice one ehg.     I just finished adding ricksters 24"" NGL Trout and now your 29.5"" Pike.  This puts team 9 at 144.75"".  A few more inches and both would have gualified for the bonus inches.  FOTB "
68871,mattyk,2007-05-07 23:13:00,2110,nice pike!
68901,Carp,2007-05-07 23:41:00,1488,Good shooting egh.  I'm sure your team is glad to have you aboard.  Keep at 'em.
69027,auscanman,2007-05-08 04:00:00,11,"Was out there at the Islands today (Monday).  Managed to get 2 pike... one was about 4 pounds, the other 2.5 pounds.  Both fish were caught in weeds located on dropoffs to fairly deep water, also got 2 hits in the spot where I caught the 4 pounder.  I tried a variety of presentations, with one pike coming on a gently retrieved husky jerk, and the other on a jig; slow presentations definitely worked best.  Weeds, dropoffs and water that's cloudy enough that you can't quite see the bottom of the deeper section of the channel all seemed to be key.  Not sure where all the big boys are?!?"
69071,b2kptbo,2007-05-08 12:27:00,1505,"Nice pike and pic's, thanks..."
69106,Bitsmith2k,2007-05-08 14:29:00,396,nice job ehg..  the slow presentations were definately working on sunday for my buddy..
