68717,Whopper,2007-05-07 16:40:00,2174,Had a great weekend at Lake Erie except for battling the waves. Saturday's wave heights were 3 to 5 footers and Sunday's were 5 to 8 footers. Made for some good drifting but was hard on the body. Fished out along the Canadian border south of Peele Island drifting worm harnesses on the bottom. Boat of five caught 13 good sized fish on Saturday and Sunday only two of us went out and caught twelve. Didn't take a lot of pics but heres a few. Saturday   Sunday   Had a great time and think we did pretty well for the rough conditions.  Whopper
