68570,Mike the Pike,2007-05-07 05:24:00,3421,"Well after reading Jen's report my pics won't be as exciting as those great fish caught by her gang.  Jen.  Well after my Skunk with my son Ryan it was off to the Bay of Quinte to try and catch some Walleye.It was so nice to cross the Bridge over the BOQ knowing that the fishing would soon begin.     As planned Percher and I headed off to meet Sonny ,Easton and Jen we showed up a little later because we could not find Pickeral Park in the Dark and Percher had to get some Java at Timmies.Well we finally arrived.It was Great to meet you guys.   From left to right,Percher,Mike the Pike,Jen,Easton and Sonny.   Sonny showing me his fully loaded legend.  I would of liked to stay longer with the Pickeral Park Gang but I knew  I had to get back to get enough sleep so I could wake up at LEW OCLOCK.   Percher beginning the day looking for the Walleye.   My fishing chauffeur Kenny starts our day off with the First little Walleye.      We met up with Sonny and I believe Easton's Dad.So we ask Sonny how he was doing and he says we caught one Walleye 8lbs another 5.9lbs. Man was I envious of Sonny.Jen that should answer one of your questions on how much the fish weighed. Well kenny caught a 2lb dinker and me I was still trying to get my first fish.WTG Sonny  I took these 2 shots of Sonny riding beside us in his Legend before and after. this will give you an idea of how choppy the waves were.      Here are the 2 other members of our fishing party Dan and Dave.See Saw and Chain Saw.MAN CAN THESE GUYS SNORE AT NIGHT   From left to right My cousin Percher(Dan),Kenny,Dave,Danny,and Me MTP.   After 14 hours and Fifteen minutes I finally land this little keeper for consumption UMMMMMMMMMM, at 8:15pm Saturday and I can finally help my team.Team #4.        Last week in my report with my son I told you all about the guy who snagged my planer board and I lost a Lucky Craft Lure. Well this morning (Sunday)I put on a deep diving crank bait and fate turns my way.I hooked into a pile of line after wrapping a good pile of line around my hand and I pulled up this Reef runner in perfect condition.No rust.    Kenny taking it all in.SUN     Does anyone know what the red spot could be ?It also had a dark spot on the top Dorsal Fin. I decided to let this one go.   This was first prize in the Walleye category for the Quinte Fishing Tournament.   First Prize in the Pike category.   More Prizes.       Reality check we had to go home  Overall we had a great weekend.No huge fish just some keepers. It was nice to meet some more of our members.  I will be back in the BOQ in 2 weeks.  Mike the Pike"
