Adventure series would be one of Mr. Pike, Bob Izumi, or Angler.  I think even a Pro V 17 from that year would be the same.  It's either 3/4"" or 1 1/8""  Also if you could check to see what GPH rating they were putting in that would be awesome.  After seeing that post about the tundra that sunk, I have decided it's high time I changed the pump to a 750GPH with auto.  I want to pick one up before Saturday when I move the boat from winter storage to summer land dock.  Thanks in advance"
69320,Daplumma,2007-05-09 00:45:00,1961,I would think the outlet of the pump would dictate the size of the hose.Good idea having an automatic bilge. Joe

Looks like this will be fun....  Just like when I tried to replace the livewell and deck lights with LED replacements,  that I can't find any to fit."
