My buddy Jason and I headed up in search of some bruisers.  Started off pretty slow, 3 or 4 followers, no takers.  Caught a few bass, obviously released immediately.  Then since it was slow, we decided lets do some crappie fishing.  Got into em pretty good for about an hour, caught about 50, kept a dozen for the pan.  All fish between 8-11 inches.       Then back to the pike fishing.  We start firing big jerkbaits, then WHAM, Jasons rod is bent right over.  After probably 5 minutes we get a glimpse of the fish, a HUGE muskie.  The fish was released without ever leaving the water, It was easily a 50 incher, although the pic doesnt do it much justice until youcomapre the size of things.    Good day out."

68143,steverowbotham,2007-05-05 22:03:00,1800,"bait of choice was a white 1"" twistertail on a 1/32 oz white jighead, no float.  Just swimming it slowly back to the boat.  Water was calm where we were fishing, and we could generally see the hit.  Hope to back back at her pretty soon."
