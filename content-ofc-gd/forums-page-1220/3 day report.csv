68446,xrap,2007-05-07 00:13:00,683,Well it all started off Friday night at Dunnville. We were in search of big cats and they only thing we seemed to get were small kitties. After a while we got bored and decided to try for some night carp and I didn't have any success but my brother in law got a few small ones. Even tho we didn't manage to land alot of fish we still had a great time.  First small carp   Brother in law with carp. Smoke from the fire ruined the pic   Nice fire we had going from 11pm to 5:30am    So after getting home around 6:30am I went to bed and then was up at 11 and then went perching with my dad down to Port Dover. We got their and there wasn't too many people on the pier fishing. Winds were strong and were blowing North East turning the perch off. Then we went carping to a small grand river trib. The carp were biting like crazy at first but my brother in law kept losing them at shore. After about losing 6 my sister finally landed were first carp. As for me I landed a couple as well.   My carp   Brother in laws sucker   Shot of carp   Carp on   My second carp   My sisters first carp. Sorry bought the pics it was edited and came out more to the side.
