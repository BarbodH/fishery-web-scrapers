I have an old 14 aluminum v-hull that has 3 swivel seats, a 9 hp sea king, and it isn't overly heavy, do a lot of pond hopping and small lakes in the midwest. I would appreciate any insight to the proper thrust I need, brand name, or is the bass pro shop brand ok? Thinking of something in the 40-55 lb. thrust to really get me around. Also surely I don't need a 42"" shaft do I...thanks for the help as always gals and guys."
