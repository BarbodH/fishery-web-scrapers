68670,kennyman,2007-05-07 15:05:00,737,"Me and my buddy LJ went ""perchin"" yesterday in Orillia. It was a pretty nice day,14 degrees and sunny. The fishing was fairly slow from what I'm told and strangely enough so was the boat traffic (although it was enough traffic for me). We caught about thirty fish each (a wide range of sizes ), all perch and all on minnows except for one,which LJ caught on a worm. More importantly it was our maiden voyage with my new (to me) 12 ft. Sea King tinny. The boat didn't sink (or crash,but it does seep a little) and the 9.5 Evinrude runs like a swiss watch. All in all a good day, but no tags darn it. I would have loved to get one as my Dad and stepmom usually get at least one tag every year. They got the first one of the derby this year, but have been skunked since.Only 9 of the 60 available tags have been caught as of last night and none of the big ones only $500 (I wouldn't have complained LOL). According to my Dad the perch have moved out and are harder to find (in their regular numbers) than normal. All in all it was a good first day and on the water and using the ultralight some of the bigger perch were fun to bring in. Pike opens next weekend and if the weather is decent I'll be heading back up there. For that I might even remember the camera!"

68710,ishingchippy,2007-05-07 16:18:00,33,"Actually as of Saturday one of the 2500.00 tagged perch had been caught.  Fishing was slow for all of us at the perch tourney this weekend.  At least all with a boat did better then us shore fisherman   Ah well, a day of fishing is better then none right"
68742,kennyman,2007-05-07 17:28:00,737,"Oops, I didn't know that the $2500 had been caught. I guess the $5000 is still out there.  I think the sponsorship must be down now or something. My Dad caught the ""big tag"" a few years back I think he got approx. $23,000. Not that there is anything wrong with $5000. I'd gladly take that!!!                     Oh Misfish, don't feel bad. I missed my brother out there??How'd you do out there?"
68745,misfish,2007-05-07 17:52:00,29133,Wind burn and a cold is all we caught.LOL You didnt see me eh?????????????????????????? Red bass boat with a little orange guy standing at the back?
68998,kennyman,2007-05-08 02:42:00,737,"No, I didn't see you Misfish. well, maybe I did. There were still about fifteen or so boats around us all afternoon. I can't believe I didn't notice a ""red boat with a little orange guy standing at the back"". That makes you sound like an ""Umpa Lumpa"" ....... LOL.  Were you the only guy out there with a survival suit on?"
