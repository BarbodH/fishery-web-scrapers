69141,fishdawg,2007-05-08 16:17:00,912," not trying to shake the ship here Roy, but I do believe that once the fish are smoked, they are considered to be preserved/cooked  - no longer count against your possession limit  - I very well could be wrong,  but I have herd this from a few others before  kinda like those who can/pickle fish for personal use over the winter ect...."
