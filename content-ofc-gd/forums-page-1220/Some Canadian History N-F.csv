69093,Terry,2007-05-08 13:50:00,14456,"yup, know lots about it still don't know why the gov. agreed to scrap it and destroy all the planes and plans.....they were almost the equal of any fighter jets made  today"
69095,irishfield,2007-05-08 13:59:00,26272, Another parlimentary leader with a presidential brown nose and weak knees....
69096,yellowboat,2007-05-08 14:04:00,211,"They scraped because our friends from the south were scared of it and NASA wanted the engineers from that program, but as a consolation prize we got some nice missiles with no warheads.  The airplane museum at Downsview just finished there replica a few months ago."
69098,OhioFisherman,2007-05-08 14:09:00,6623,"It was a good program, and that was the idea I got from it, it`s all about the money. Can`t have a country with way less people have a better plane, LOL make a deal, er show me da money!"
69099,Ned Devine,2007-05-08 14:11:00,13,"As the story goes, I believe one of the test pilots, for kicks,  took her across Lake Ontario and buzzed the US Air Force base in Niagara Falls, NY.  How's that for a Howdy Do?  Would have loved to have been there!  Beauty eh?"
69101,OhioFisherman,2007-05-08 14:15:00,6623,"LOL Ned, that would have been enough. I think Curtis Lemay was running the US air force back then and it would have pushed him over the edge."
69219,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-08 20:51:00,2585,my grandfather worked as a machinist on that jet.  When they scrapped it Nasa wanted him to go down south to work with them as they were in desperate need of people to work on there aircraft.  My grandfather declined going down there as I beleive there was a war at the time and was worried about my uncle and my dad being sent to battle.  At the time they didnt have a clue of how tech. advanced that jet was.  someone got a heavy load of cash in there pocket and that was the end of that.  Awesome jet though!  Cheers!
69249,Bob,2007-05-08 22:41:00,370,"My father worked on the fuel system and modular weapons systems for that plane.  When they scrapped it, most of his friends were laid off but Dad was lucky enough to keep his job.  I watched one of the test flights go by, amazing.  Dad also got to know Zurakowski, the test pilot."
69252,lew,2007-05-08 22:47:00,12767," Pretty sure I  read that Mr. Zurakowski died not too long ago, maybe within the last 2 years or so ??"
69270,Bob,2007-05-08 23:22:00,370,Pretty close Lew.  Believe he died in 04 at Barry's Bay.  I think he quit flying and bought a tourist camp after they scrapped the arrow.  I think there's a memorial museum there now.
69341,holdfast,2007-05-09 01:15:00,1813,"Thats what I also heard, of what Yellowboat stated.  Huge statue of him( Mr. Zurakowski)  in Barrys Bay.  Nice town to visit or pass through.  Great Polish Deli"

69418,holdfast,2007-05-09 04:42:00,1813,"Biff, What does that have to do with the jet"
