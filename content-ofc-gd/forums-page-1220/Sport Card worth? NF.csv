69167,valerie,2007-05-08 18:06:00,83,"Check it out on ebay , very fast and easy"
69224,Bob,2007-05-08 21:19:00,370,You'll find that these things are worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them.  Professional dealers will obviously try to low-ball the price so they can profit.  I have complete sets for the Jays for the years they won the series.  What would they be worth?  Who knows?  I wouldn't offer them to a dealer though.
69229,urbanangler1990,2007-05-08 21:40:00,933,"if theyre not worth much then i wont sell em for sure, thnx"
69230,misfish,2007-05-08 21:46:00,29133," Maybe not now they are not,but in time they will,hang on to them for the future.Children, grandchildren.Thats what Im doing."
69251,urbanangler1990,2007-05-08 22:46:00,933,"  think of a card thats 100 years old, wow"
69277,Dutch,2007-05-08 23:31:00,831,"I was an avid basketball card collector going back a few years.  Your Bird card would ""book"" at $2-$3 Max.  Back then, when card collecting was ""hot"" companies over-produced and the real determination of a card's worth, scarcity or rarity, was a distant thing of the past.  Not sure about your Poke-e-man cards.  E-Bay would probably tell you what people are paying, but it is really a buyer's market.  For example your Bird card would probably go for about $0.05 - $0.25 if someone were to buy it."
69282,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-08 23:43:00,0,I guess I will have to wait for Jarg and Lindstron to get into the hall of fame before I can cash in of the mutlitudes of rookie cards I have for those 2. I only colected cards for a few years back then and have a lot of full sets but I do remember having a lot of those two guys rookie cards.
69351,DMASSE,2007-05-09 01:27:00,420,"The problem with Sports cards , starting from the early 80's to today, is that they were and are so mass produced that the value just isnt there...  Some of the less common insert sets can be worth more, like signatures, jerseys etc etc...  I have tons of cards fron the 60's 70's and eighties...  Now if you had MAGIC cards ( first series) ALPHA, or BETA  some of those cards are worth thousands.....  Dave"
69357,urbanangler1990,2007-05-09 01:40:00,933," well ill just hang on to them for a few more decades, lol thnx"
69362,urbanangler1990,2007-05-09 01:43:00,933," nope just NBA HOOPS, too bad the companies over produced  lol"
69369,Heybud_e,2007-05-09 01:55:00,208,ill trade you my Cam Neely and Andy Moog for your Ray Bourque
69380,Dutch,2007-05-09 02:10:00,831," I agree with you about early '80's baseball, but not hockey or basketball - some pretty goods sets from the early - mid '80's in hockey.  The greatest basketball sets, outside the '50's, were produced in the mid '80's, Fleer to be exact.  The way to go now is with serial numbered rookie/signed cards.  Hard (if not impossible) to pull from packs our days, unless you spend thousands on a case.  It's really unfortunate as collecting is not done by kids much anymore, just by adults that can afford to lay out $6 plus on a pack of 5 cards.  Bring back Hoops and Pro-Set.  At least the young kids could afford to buy a pack and have the thrill of pulling out their favorite player."
