69122,luv2drift,2007-05-08 15:16:00,147,Has anyone used the waders from Canadian tire.  I am looking for a good yet cheap pair of breathable waders.  My neoprenes are too hot for this time of year?
69128,snag,2007-05-08 15:33:00,1932,"(Psssst dude,Ryan, alter the thread title)  Considering the love-in you now have with BPS, I bought some there, almost 50% off!  I got the ones with the neoprene booties. I trust them more than the booted variety.  Good luck.  Hope you had good fiddleheads!"
69130,FishFinder,2007-05-08 15:44:00,481,"I dont think the canadaian tire ones are breathable, just a similar material."
69158,jdmls,2007-05-08 17:34:00,575,"breathables will only get you one thing.............WET !!!!! I have had the BPS $150 dolalr pair and they were good for about 5 outings before they leaked in both legs through the seams.  I then purchased a pair of simms (top notch) ...... they lasted a season and began leaking through the seams as well.  After two or three pairs I got upset and sick of the returning and waiting for warranty bullpoop and went back to the BARE neoprenes. There a pain in the ass to put on and take off but they are reliable.  Just my 2 cents  Oh ya and I have two buddies that did the same thing and all of ours failed miserably , just incase you think its a one hit wonder !!!"
69192,luv2drift,2007-05-08 19:17:00,147,snog thanks for the heads up on the title ...hahahaha. jdmls ..really?  Well I got the neo Bare's so I guess I'll just stick with those.  I thought the breathable might have been a little cooler..guess not  got a love this site for tips. Snog fiddle heads are good. nothing like trout and fiddle heads.  Did you sail the yak yet?
69216,snag,2007-05-08 20:30:00,1932," Yup,  It was great. How the heck did you fit in it!  Funny story:  I paddled out to an island. Fumbled out of the kayak and kinda kicked it. Woosh, It was just out of grasp and then the wind caught it. I was literally up the creek without a kayak. I panicked, Then I grabbed my rod and started casting for it, I missed and it got further away. I was freaking out. Luckily I did a good cast and caught it. Reeled it in slowly (thank god for 30# PP) That was fun.  Thanks again!"
