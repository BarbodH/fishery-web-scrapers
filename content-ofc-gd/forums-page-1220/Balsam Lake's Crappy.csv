The Crappie were few and far between at my first spot, but I started to hit some decent ones at the second spot. Ended up catching around 30 fish and kept 9 of the best for dinner tonight. I hope they stick around for another couple of weeks.  MMMMMMMMMMMMM Crispy Beer Batter!!    "
68127,bbog,2007-05-05 21:14:00,665,Great looking catch. We got a few more yesterday than we did a week ago. They're started to come in but not in great numbers yet. I'm gonna try again tomorrow and will post pictures of my results.

68296,musky66,2007-05-06 13:55:00,273,I wonder if the lakes Pike and Musky are keying on Crappie as a forage species? Methinks I will try some similiar coloured lures in the kawarthas this season!
