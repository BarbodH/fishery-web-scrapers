69220,Uncle Buck,2007-05-08 20:53:00,1000," See that round ring around my stomach, oh wait that's something else...  my float suit was in the bow,not that i would have had time to put it on god forbid something happened..  I'm terrible for the lifejacket thing though... think i've only worn it 3 times, i'm better with the float suit though...  this time i brought it, i just didn't wear it, every other time, i would have worn it...  Mark, the problem with being so big, is every fish i hold, looks small...  Wayne, i've been promoted, now it's EDM & CNC and i haven't gotten a burning chip in the neck, i can't remember when... God i love the enclosure"
