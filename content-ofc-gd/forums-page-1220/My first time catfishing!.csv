68816,Fishmaster,2007-05-07 21:13:00,920,Jen did those Bald Eagle Pics show up ...ok now show your big cat ..
68825,Jen,2007-05-07 21:35:00,833,"Nope, as by the time I got my camera turned on and ready the bald eagle had landed in its nest... so all I got was a picture of a nest a tree and the idea that something is in it.  Was truly amazing though without a doubt.     Here is the bigger catfish that I brought in...     Thanks again fishmaster, next time Easton and I will join you."

67679,Jen,2007-05-04 04:38:00,833,"The evening began with a fire in my oven... now that was a great joy seeing as I was cooking for the weekend and really needed the use of that oven.  So off I went to drop the pizza off at Eastons so that he could finish it off and decided I was going fishing.  Stressed and not wanting to be in the kitchen anymore.  And here is what I caught.    Now if I can only remember to bring along my ofncommunity.com sign I would be doing ok.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!  I look forward to all the posts... Off to Quinte in the morning with camera and SIGN in hand!  Cheers,  Jen"
