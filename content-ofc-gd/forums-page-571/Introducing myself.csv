555144,umKthxbye,2011-02-24 19:42:00,247,"Hello every one. My name is Darren and I'm 26 years old. I just moved to Kingston, Ontario from Ottawa. It wasn't an issue in Ottawa to get around to fishing spots with the available cars I could borrow from family. But now it will be a bit harder to hit the waters. I'm actually looking for fishing buddies in the Kingston area. Ive mostly done shore fishing since I don't have access to a boat. I'm off work every weekend so will be hotting the water as much as possible by busing **shudder** and walking. Ive mostly been using my spinning set up but just bought my first baitcaster setup and I'm pumped to try this out. I have a 6'6 MH Abu Garcia Vendetta paired with a Shimano Caene reel. So if any one is interested in a fishing buddy let me know. I just restarted fishing last year when I got my new spinning setup and have gotten hooked again(broke my original rod a long time ago and never got a new one till last year). Getting a new tackle box tomorrow(Friday), YAY.  Anyways, I hope I can help out in this fishing community, take care all.  If there are weird typos or words that make no sense, you can blame my iPhone auto correct =P  PS: I'm more then willing to join any fishing tournament if anyone needs a partner and can provide a ride to the tournaments."

555149,Pikeslayer,2011-02-24 20:06:00,1443,"Hey, Welcome to OFC . Sorry I can't help you with the Kingston area but this is a largely populated board with many sincere (except Mercman  ) members who get together all the time. I have met and arranged fishing dates with a number of members on the board. I am in the GTA but there's gotta be some 'good guys' out your way for sure. Maybe think about joining the tournament teams here on OFC and pm/kindly ask the tournament monitor (SlowPoke) if he could place you on a team with a member out your way?? Not sure if that's doable, but worth a try.Here's the tournament team sign up link http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=50035 Good luck to ya and watch out for Mercman  .  Regards, Slayer"
