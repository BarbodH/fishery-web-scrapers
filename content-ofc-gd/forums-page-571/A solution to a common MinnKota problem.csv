When you get to be in your early 30's you really appreciate your father's handiness.  My father has that in spades.  Anyways, most people that have a bowmount MinnKota in the same style as mine know that you have to kick the crap out of it and yourself to get the bloody thing out of its little seat.  Solution.  My father rigged this up the other year and it works like a charm.  The lever.  Stainless steel, he fabricated it all.  Rubber coated handle.         He also made the best spud bar I have ever laid eyes on.  Everywhere we go people comment and drool over it.  Full on stainless steel with rubber coating and handle.  I can not find a picture of it.  Just thought maybe some of you handy guys could do something similar to your boat.  I am telling you it works like a charm.  Cheers"
