You never know, you may bump into him. Click on the link to read about it. BASS friends with carp I don't seriously expect you to do so. But it does show that efforts are being made to extend the hand of friendship amongst anglers and that is a good thing for all of us."
555431,mike rousseau,2011-02-25 18:55:00,4661,This is the publicity carp angling needs!  If somebody in a position like this is calling carp sport fish... Then maybe the closed minded dummys that constantly bash carp fishing will follow suit...
555432,OhioFisherman,2011-02-25 18:58:00,6623,If bass keeps showing it`s anglers pulling bass off of spawning beds carp might be all that are left?  Heck anyone that catches carp is a friend of mine! use a gorge hook.
555436,Roy,2011-02-25 19:11:00,13728," I don't know why but I get the impression that Mr. Scott did something bad and 2 days with carp folks is part of his community service.  Now don't be getting all flustered, you know I love you carp dudes."
555437,mike rousseau,2011-02-25 19:12:00,4661,"... Not what I meant....  But think of it this way... Carp have been here over 100 years... They aren't going anywhere!  So wouldn't you rather see me and my buddies  on the  bank fishing for ""garbage fish"" instead of your favorite spot for bass... Walleye... Or musky?"
555438,mike rousseau,2011-02-25 19:14:00,4661, He's probably thinking about a north American carp tournament series...
555439,hammercarp,2011-02-25 19:15:00,964,":lol: I do not doubt that having to rub elbows with Brits, Hungarians, South Africans and others from around the globe will do him some good."
555440,wolfville,2011-02-25 19:25:00,396,"Great news, thanks Lorne for sharing."
555441,Harrison,2011-02-25 19:28:00,2202,The CarpMasters  I am going to contact the Jolly Green Giant for a corn sponsorship..... just thinking ahead.
