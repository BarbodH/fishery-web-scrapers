555139,irishfield,2011-02-24 19:28:00,26272,Good to know Thraser... a 18 mile or so run for me though.. long walk back solo. I'll see what happens and if my neighbour wants to head that way.  Now with you guys being mobile and with 3 sleds.. why the heck would you hang around the island? Some good back lakes close by to Tamar....
555143,Leecher,2011-02-24 19:42:00,7832,"Yikes!!! Sorry to hear that Wayne   Like the old saying goes ""tomorrow's another day"" Tomorrow, don't make plans, get up and just go"
555193,Thrasher,2011-02-24 22:18:00,39,"18 miles! wrongfuly so apparently, but I thought you were closer to the end of the access rd! that would be a long hike! We're usually not far from the island, cause that's where I know best. I spend a lot of time in Cross during the open water season, so I tend to know that end better. We spend 3/4 of our time fishing Walleye, and the rest on Lakers. Most of the guys in our group have paddled through a lot of the back lakes, but never fished them. Other than hearing that a couple of the back lakes around there hold some fish, I've never heard or saw anything that would make me go to them. We've got Electronics, mapping chips, etc and like you said are mobile, so it's not an issue for us to do it, just never had the need as we generally do OK down there. I'm open to ideas if you're sharing back lake walleye sopts! lol! Anyway, we should be at the lake around 6 or 7 am heading down, and fishing by 8. You know where we'll be if you decide to go for a tour!! good luck! Thrasher"
555198,irishfield,2011-02-24 22:28:00,26272,Yah Thrasher.. I'm right across from the park.. 4 island out from Town. I'll send you a PM..
555220,irishfield,2011-02-24 23:51:00,26272,"Well I'm gonna jinx myself and say I have a green light to go in the am, with Jen's chemo fever apparently in check again. Should be up there by 1 or 2pm, or so, and have another green light to stay 'till Thursday at the latest.. as I have a customer coming from White River on Friday and have to be back!  So again.. the offer is there.. anyone that wants to get out for even a day this weekend or early next week..PM me tonight if you think you might wanna drop by.... or 411.ca for my hard line # if I'm already gone."
555224,hunter391,2011-02-25 00:08:00,1, First time poster. To bad Some of you guys can not take up Irishfields offer it is something else on Temagaqmi. I would be asking him if I could go if I was not already booked with Loon lodge next Friday. Jerry
554226,irishfield,2011-02-22 01:21:00,26272,LOL... that'd take some good photoshop as I've never ice fished Nip !
554227,Spiel,2011-02-22 01:22:00,9065," Oh come on Wayne, I recognize that tall tree in the upper left corner and the one hidden behind the hut."
554230,Terry,2011-02-22 01:27:00,14456,one fish  ok they are endangered not extinct
554234,irishfield,2011-02-22 01:38:00,26272,
554238,Spiel,2011-02-22 01:44:00,9065,I'm thinking that one come up from 30 plus feet of water.
554241,irishfield,2011-02-22 01:46:00,26272,"So did mine... not the targeted species, but wadda ya do when they're in 68 feet of whitie water? Why I think the slot should go in the winter time...."
554242,Terry,2011-02-22 01:47:00,14456, good eye  no not the fish I mean noticing something sticking out of it....
554243,Spiel,2011-02-22 01:48:00,9065," You'll get no arguments from me on that, slots and winter walleye are a waste of fish."
554270,walleyemaster,2011-02-22 03:09:00,325,  you can add these walleye to the no walleye in temagami have lots more of them if you wanna see them     
554344,bigbuck,2011-02-22 14:23:00,2449,"IFF (if and only if) I had a sled and it wasn't the last week of my busy season, I would be on this like white on rice. Just goes to show what kind of a guy Wayne is, offering up his little piece of paradise to us OFC'rs. If you do make it up there, I hope you slay the walters and brookies."
554847,irishfield,2011-02-23 23:07:00,26272,"Well a tad disappointing that nobody can abandon their keyboards for a few days, but I'm off bright and early. Truck and trailer packed and ready to roll. Neighbour knows I'm coming and ready to fish, as are Walleyemaster and a few others in town that I can get out with.  If anyone wakes up and realizes what their missin... if you seriously wanna drop by a little google work will find my hard line phone number at the lake and I'll make sure the answering machine is on. Plan at this point is up tomorrow.. home Monday or Tuesday. I'll also check my PM's before leaving in the am.  "
554858,GBW,2011-02-23 23:36:00,8460,"wish I could Wayne, I WISH I COULD!!!!! I wouldn't need a sled either, just a ski rope and my snowboard."
554867,ehg,2011-02-23 23:55:00,2666," Good Luck Wayne, hopefully you unwind and relax.  Probably 98% of folks can't leave their jobs, families and prior commitments to do this even though most wish they could. It is Fishing for Tyler this weekend as well. Most don't have the luxuries or freedoms you have. Cest la vie."
554870,irishfield,2011-02-24 00:06:00,26272,"I hear ya Erik.. well kinda anyhow. There ain't no ""freedoms"" this winter, if I can figure out how to squeeze in a trip at this point in time, anyone can."
554874,ehg,2011-02-24 00:10:00,2666,Your a lucky man Wayne! Your hard work and efforts will take you a long way. Hope you catch some decent fish
554875,misfish,2011-02-24 00:12:00,29133," Well when yer the only weld tec,and robot guy,it,s hard to get away my friend. Plus you did say sled and tow bar,which I have none of. Enjoy your time away.Clear yer head . I know I could use that right about now. Safe trip."

554896,Grimace,2011-02-24 01:01:00,2020,Good luck Wayne.  I wish I could gotten a few days off of work.
554905,GBW,2011-02-24 01:17:00,8460,I gotta feeling that tonight’s gonna be a good night That tonight’s gonna be a good night That tonight’s gonna be a good good night (x3) 
554907,irishfield,2011-02-24 01:20:00,26272,Na.. she now has my cold. I was quarantined to my room yesterday and was supposed to be getting out of here before I gave it to Jen. Now Leah has it. Both of us are tired of blow the nose.. hand sanitizer.. blow the nose.. hand sanitizer.. every 2 minutes. Thank God they gave Jen Cipro this round to help her fight things off...
554921,GBW,2011-02-24 01:35:00,8460,
555103,Leecher,2011-02-24 17:46:00,7832,Hey Wayne... I thought you had packed and gone already... what happened
555134,irishfield,2011-02-24 18:56:00,26272,"Yah had to ask eh Jacque.. lol  Up 'till 4am monitoring Jennifer as her temp started to climb.. at 3am she wanted some fresh water/ice so I'm standing at the fridge and it's going spurt..spurt..spurt and I think to myself how the hell is air getting into the line, just as my feet start to get soaked and the kitchen floor starts to flood. Glad I never finished the basement ceiling so that I could find the water line valve quickly!! Just finished putting the fridge back together.  Gonna see how the day goes and try a departure again in the am. I'm not gonna hold my breath... guess it's a good thing nobody could go!"
555135,Thrasher,2011-02-24 18:57:00,39,"Haven't posted or read in a while, try to spend as little time on the computer as possible!! Wish I knew before we booked! 5 buddies and I will be at Tamar from Friday early morning till Sunday mid day. We likely won't be in his huts, but not too far from the island. 3 sleds with 3 portable huts. grand touring with an otter, venture with a clam, and an arctic cat with a frabill. If you're bored and want to say hi, fish, drink, or whatever, we'll be down there. Good luck!! Thrasher"
553188,fishhunter,2011-02-19 00:08:00,604,thats how it works for me too.  but then there is that work thing that gets in the way.
553190,BUSTER,2011-02-19 00:12:00,1336,That's why we are happily married...................Still.
553192,irishfield,2011-02-19 00:19:00,26272,"  Bernie.. report from tonights call..  24"" of ice.. snow knocked down and our neighbour plowed down the snow bank from the ice road to my ""parking lot"" and then mixed the remaining snow into the 5"" of water so it will freeze up real nice for my arrival.  I'm just mystified with 7000 members and nobody appears able to go. Oh well.. I won't ask twice."
553196,Leecher,2011-02-19 00:29:00,7832," Well if you really want me to go, can you pick me up by plane?? You have yourself a great trip Wayne   but most of all be safe"
553211,FishAbout,2011-02-19 00:55:00,106,I would like to go but I have a dentist appointment thursday. Can't cancel it.  If you decide to leave thursday i'm in.
553928,Spiel,2011-02-21 12:51:00,9065,"Damn, I can't believe your not turning people away on this offer Wayne. I'd be all over it in a New York minute if health allowed me."
553932,danbouck,2011-02-21 12:59:00,4380," I think it's because most people don't have a sled. If I did, it would be a no brainer."
553933,Spiel,2011-02-21 13:03:00,9065," I don't have one either Dan but I'd be pretty quick to borrow or rent one, it'd be worth every penny."
553985,irishfield,2011-02-21 15:06:00,26272,Worst part is having people say they'll go.. you change the departure date to do so.. and THEN they ask their wife!
553986,Spiel,2011-02-21 15:09:00,9065," LOL....Not an issue for me Wayne.  Hopefully things will turn around for me by summer and I can get back to some ice fishing next year, I do miss it!"
553994,nofish4me,2011-02-21 15:34:00,404," I know what you mean. If I was to say I was good to go, there would be no ""ask the wife"", I would tell her when I was not going to be home. I was this way before being married, fishing and some absence from her is who I am. She seems to have stuck it out after 20 some years, I can't be that bad. Now, having said that, I will always consider what's on the calendar for family, before I set dates. I've had people ask me, ""..how do you get away with going fishing as many times as you do.."". There is no getting away with anything, going fishing is a major part of Who I am! I would love to go on this trip, but can't."
553996,irishfield,2011-02-21 15:40:00,26272,"I hear you on pre-planning the escape.. consult the calendar drawer....broach the question ""will you miss me"" >NO< and then say I'm in.  Also interesting on what you can work out if you really want to go, like Spiel mentioned. Beg, borrow or steal a sled.. in my case I asked the neighbour at the lake if he has a spare we can use, which he does, so waiting on someone (that showed some interest early on and only had an ATV) to tell me if he can go ."
553997,dsn,2011-02-21 15:42:00,1018,"Aw no Bible Christain Study Camp.. huh? Guess that means I don't qualify. Guess we'll never know what the fishing could have been like then.  However,  I pray you have great and safe journey, And that God will have mercy and bless you're trip.    Do bring back lots of pics.  dsn"
554006,walleyemaster,2011-02-21 16:18:00,325,"Wayne if i could have you at our cottage i would. the problem is we are 4 guys with a cottage that has 2 rooms, one room has a bunck bed and the other has a double bed, 1 guy will sleep on the couch. its a buddies cottage so price is good....lol, did you end up finding anyone??? i cant believe anyone would turn this trip down..did i see you even found a sled for someone to use??? wow its a no brainer...  come on guys look at the fish you get in temagami Speckles and Walleye  "
554018,nofish4me,2011-02-21 17:03:00,404," I've never thought much about it before, but maybe the wife enjoys my time away from home, runnin' dogs and fishin'. Hahaha"
554052,nofish4me,2011-02-21 18:37:00,404,Full house yet?
554053,deepwaterbyshore,2011-02-21 18:38:00,10,"hey wayne ,mike here .my dad and i will be on lake temagami from tues 22 until sat. 26 .we are on island 993.just 5 min south west from mels market on bear island.there is a little island in front of are cottage call lovesick.where people carve there names into the rock.are handle up there is camp 993 on the cb.i fish by myself most of the time ,will be fishing south east of sand point just across from halls island ...little rock pile there ,will be in a white porable hut with wooden ends ..stop by at either location love some company ...would like to try koko too never be there."
554066,irishfield,2011-02-21 19:17:00,26272,Mike.. Walleyemaster would be your best bet for an easy hook up.. he's staying on Bear or Temagami Island.. I'm 12 miles away on the NE Arm.
554067,irishfield,2011-02-21 19:18:00,26272, Why.. she kickin you out???
554079,nofish4me,2011-02-21 19:58:00,404," Wiped off monitor........now I can see what I'm typing. Been a rough winter, around the home alot, tuff running dogs that are less than 13"" at shoulders, this winter. I'm spoiled with 4' thick ice for ice fishing, so I have a long drive, or stay home (bugs the wife, I'm begining to think)."
554109,deepwaterbyshore,2011-02-21 21:12:00,10,
554112,deepwaterbyshore,2011-02-21 21:14:00,10,ok sounds good ...good luck  and have a safe trip
554220,Terry,2011-02-22 01:14:00,14456," no way you bought them from the local store right, there are no walleye on temagami...LOL at lest no for me there aren't"
554222,irishfield,2011-02-22 01:17:00,26272,What's that you say Terry...  
554224,Spiel,2011-02-22 01:19:00,9065,  Looks like Nipissing to me.
552909,Roy,2011-02-18 08:25:00,13728," I'm here to tell you that that's not at all how it works at Joey's house. Here's the real version.  ""Hon, I'm going fishing with the guys for a week.""  And PAUL would say:  ""Okay, have fun""   Wayne, I know you'll have a great time whoever takes you up on that great offer. Lord knows a break from what you've been going through is not a lot to ask for."
552922,Whopper,2011-02-18 11:54:00,2174,LOL Joey Kind of the way it goes at my house....well sort of  Good luck finding some fishing partners Wayne
552942,Grimace,2011-02-18 12:54:00,2020,I just talked to my boss Wayne and we are too busy. I thought I could sneak out for a few days but I can't. Lloyd's record is safe.  Lol.  Sorry man. I was really getting excited at the prospect.
552947,camillj,2011-02-18 13:19:00,1988,Ahhhh ... I missed this post Wayne ... now I understand  .. jeesh I guess I GOTTA get me a darn sled ! (Can I just buy one and leave it at your place ?  Anyhow have a great weekend. If you're free tomorrow I'll be at Lake Joe right near Glen Orchard with a few 'can go' fellas.
552989,fishchaser,2011-02-18 15:18:00,17,"Wayne; can you e-mail me at [email protected] it's about this upcoming trip of yours. Thanks fishchaser  old enough to know better,young enough to do it again"
552991,irishfield,2011-02-18 15:20:00,26272,No I can't and why I said to use PM's.. I am not at home!
552992,moose,2011-02-18 15:22:00,266,Would love to go Wayne With atv and tracks  and sleigh hut But time off work is tough Was supposed to go this weekend and stay with Rick this weekend In temagami
552994,irishfield,2011-02-18 15:25:00,26272,Would have been good Malcolm.. only issue with ATV and tracks as they won't fit thru the trail to the Brookie lake. Not sure about getting into Kokoko either.
552995,moose,2011-02-18 15:29:00,266,Where your fled will go my atv with trac kit will go
552996,moose,2011-02-18 15:30:00,266,Which broke lake Skunk lake
552998,cityfisher,2011-02-18 15:34:00,959,i would of loved to join... too bad work gets in the way
553003,irishfield,2011-02-18 15:38:00,26272, Any I've seen the tracks are wider than a sleds skis. At least 3 lakes we've been into the big fallen trees have about an inch of clearance between the log ends where someone has cut a section out.
553017,mercman,2011-02-18 16:27:00,7054,One thing for sure Wayne. We will all be with you in spirit.Thats a promise.  
553018,GBW,2011-02-18 16:29:00,8460,why hasn't skeeter said anything yet?
553020,mercman,2011-02-18 16:32:00,7054, He's too busy peering through holes in the ice looking for his glasses
553021,irishfield,2011-02-18 16:33:00,26272," Paul.. that'll be great, but unfortunately won't help much when I break down or get stuck in the slush without another sled to pull me out."
553023,GBW,2011-02-18 16:35:00,8460,And murdering she’s gonna kill me if she finds out this is the 3rd pair this season!
553026,Terry,2011-02-18 16:58:00,14456,"yeah...when he was making plans a couple of weeks ago that didn't work out, I had the time off and was set to go..  but this time others already had it booked off or I would be there................  sometimes things just aren't meant to be...   hope you find some good fish'n buddies for this trip.....  I will be up there on the 5 of march, if there is ice"
553027,irishfield,2011-02-18 17:04:00,26272, Yah... right up until your wife reminded you that you promised her brother that you'd help him move!
553059,Terry,2011-02-18 18:58:00,14456,"no I was talking about last week when you asked got the thurs and fri off, it didn't happen and we went fishing on GB on the friday.........  I was ready to go..that time......LOL"
553099,irishfield,2011-02-18 21:14:00,26272,Okay.. so 3 times I've tried to go North.. LOL.. my brain's a tad tattered. GBay was a great outing as well.
553107,fishnsled,2011-02-18 21:29:00,3520,"Perhaps another time Wayne. I'll be fishing, just not quite as far north. Have a great time and enjoy the stress relief, everyone here knows you could use it."
553109,Terry,2011-02-18 21:30:00,14456,bad timing hope you get a great trip out of it  if not we could go to GB again before it's closed
553179,Sinker,2011-02-18 23:48:00,8692,Yet another reason I need a new machine!!!  S.
553186,Bernie,2011-02-19 00:04:00,3190,"I don't know how mild it got in Temagami, but Nipissing is pretty much water mixed with slush right now. You may not have to battle the slush if it took down the snow there as well. The travel here will be fine after it freezes up again."
552828,irishfield,2011-02-18 01:30:00,26272,"Work is getting in the way for the usual clowns guys and this will be the third time this winter that I've tried to go North to check the camp and do some ice fishing and everyone is unavailable for a boys trip. This time I'm going with or without them!  What I'm looking for is a few guys, that have their own sleds and towable huts, that can get away from next Wednesday the 23rd until either Sunday afternoon or Monday the 28th.  As this is our summer home, that we've worked hard to renovate over the last 6 years, I'm looking for some responsible lads that can respect their surroundings. I'm not looking for any uncontrollable booze hounds... but we aren't running a Christian Bible camp either!   This is my short escape from reality... it's gonna be enjoyable and relaxing.  We'd be fishing Lake Temagami for sure and pending conditions a few back lakes as well. One a stocked Brookie lake if there's enough snow to get in, if not we turn around out of there and head into Kokoko. There'll be at least one other small group of members up there at the same time, staying on Bear Island, that I've already made arrangements to meet up with if I was going alone, so it'll be a mini meet and greet as well.  So if there are any lads here that would like to take me up on this offer, I have room for one guy and his sled and hut in my enclosed trailer for the trip up Wednesday morning.    Me leaving from Penetanguishene.. you load here or I can pick you up on the way (12 to 11 or 12/69/124/11). Any others would have to find their way to Temagami themselves and note we can drive right to my dock and I have our neighbour plowing me a parking lot.  For those that care.. I'm 48 and the usual gang stretches from their late 30's to mid 50's. That said when we all have the same interest, fishing, age isn't a big deal, but see paragraph 3 again.  Generally one guy buys the groceries (to negate repetition) and everyone pitches in for their share.....and the usual gang always gives me a ""by"" since I provide the accoms/heat/hydro. Beverages/snacks and any special ""wants"" are your own responsibilties.  For any that are interested to go, we can work that all out when the time comes as the joint grocery thing may not work for a new gang.  Space is limited to about 4 guys, 5 max. If you are interested and can do such a trip.. please PM me and we'll work out the details. I'm not currently at home... so I'll do my best to communicate as necessary.  Wayne  "
552837,GBW,2011-02-18 01:58:00,8460,Oh I wish!!!!
552838,irishfield,2011-02-18 01:59:00,26272,"Boss won't know Geoff.. he's a ""can't go"" as well.. lol"
552841,GBW,2011-02-18 02:04:00,8460," I would love to, but no sled for 1 and I have family here all weekend for a hockey tourney this weekend Wayne.  Who said family day won't wreck my fishing time..."
552848,bigugli,2011-02-18 02:44:00,6138,Now that sounds like a sweet opportunity boys and girls.

I have never had a year like this where I cant hook up with my buddy Wayne or maybe I'm an ex fishing buddy now   lol Now if you have a love for fishing and want a get away jump at this chance. The fishing is good and the company even better. If you do go, I'll even share where 43LB walter is sitting waiting."

552864,walleyemaster,2011-02-18 03:35:00,325,"im the guy on bear island so you can count on me wayne..  .. This ""cant come"" do to work stuff or ""wife wont let me go"" crap is starting to become sickning   I had to make up an escape for one of the guys comming up with me this trip.. His wife was giving him a hard time about going up due to the new baby who is now 1 and lots of work .. So here was the plan to get him to come..for the last month or so our buddy was telling the wife he was feeling stressed with work and feeling kinda down also, he moped around the house and acted like he was in a bad way.. this is where i come in . i phoned his wife one evening made some small chat and eventually asked her if she had noticed my buddy acting in a funny way.. she said yes she did notice that my buddy was kinda down, i then mentioned to her that maybe a little break might help to cheer him up and she kinda agreed, so guess who is comming again this year yup thats right John my buddy.. so you see if you wanna go you can find ways to go..For the ladies reading this, yes we will do almost anything to go fishing with the guys..for the guys reading this get out there take a few days off find a way. call me if you need help"

552871,irishfield,2011-02-18 03:52:00,26272,"LOL Dara.. I have to make it up as I go along these days. Had to wait 'till ""chemo kid"" passed her blood test, was admitted and wait to find out if there was any schedule changes or surgery plans."
552874,Joey,2011-02-18 03:53:00,9122,"  Well in our house it would go something like this:  ""Hon, I'm going fishing with the guys for a week.""  And I would say:  ""Okay, have fun"""

552890,irishfield,2011-02-18 04:19:00,26272,"Wouldn't have been any quicker than this Joey... decission was only able to be, definitely, made when I posted this. Homecare left 10 minutes before I did so."

552905,Moosebunk,2011-02-18 06:57:00,3970,"Again bud, sorry I can't.  You know I wanted to try and get together this year but the offer came a little late in the game.  Understandable given your circumstances.  I can't break other committments now.  Answered ya quick the other night as I had Stevie Zebco down from Moose Factory and we were scheming some fun.  Have a blast bud.  And any fence sitters oughtta know... Wayne is the man!  Great host, great guy, with a great pad on the big lake of Temagami."
