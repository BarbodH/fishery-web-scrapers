The moral of the story is the link below was all the info I needed.  http://boating.ncf.ca/buy-usa.html  Good luck."
555000,superdad,2011-02-24 12:35:00,353,You can review this - posted by a friend of mine who acquired his boat in the US.  http://forum2.quintefishing.com/viewtopic.php?p=14669  I bought mine in the US also and had little trouble bringing it back.  Good deals -- be cautious if it sounds too good.  Buying from a dealer lessens your dangers.  David  aka  Superdad
