There will be a total of 8 guys including us. We wanted to go with the orange guys but they are booked solid.  I was wondering what other operators on Simcoe have you had luck with, with good service and productive waters. Does anyone know of any other mobile hut operator ?  We will be taking first timer newbs with us so it doesn't really matter what they catch as long as they have something to keep them busy.  Thanks  Afraz"
