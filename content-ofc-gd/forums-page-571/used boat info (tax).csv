555047,zman,2011-02-24 14:44:00,179,Hi Everyone I have a question do you have to pay tax on a used boat and trailer when you buy it ? It will be bought private in canada
555052,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-24 14:57:00,4399,"  Yes,some will do it at registration and some will wait for a letter demanding payment!"
555060,zman,2011-02-24 15:20:00,179,do you pay just the one tax
555062,Lunker Larry,2011-02-24 15:26:00,122,Get a separate receipt for the boat and the trailer as you register them independently. Keeping the price low on the trailer will save you on the taxes. L
