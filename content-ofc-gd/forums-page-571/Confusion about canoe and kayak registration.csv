555314,Jonny,2011-02-25 04:06:00,1380,Registering unmotorized watercraft at $50 a pop --- what will they think of next...  http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/944588--boaters-fear-they-ll-be-up-a-creek-without-a-50-licence?bn=1
555320,BillM,2011-02-25 04:36:00,17367,Did you miss the part where it's only for guided trips?
555323,Jonny,2011-02-25 05:03:00,1380,"  Nope. That's why the title ""Confusion"". Seems that some people are, according to the article.  Don't be surprised if it's applied to more in the future.  "
555325,BillM,2011-02-25 05:36:00,17367,I wonder if I'll have to register my pontoon boat?!?!?  lol
555326,Jonny,2011-02-25 05:50:00,1380," Judging by ever-expanding bureaucracy and taxation (fees), you'll have to register an air mattress that you float around on.  (And they'll be able to fine you if you're found floating around without carrying an instant patch kit.)     "
555327,Afraz,2011-02-25 07:11:00,250,Wah do i need to register my 12 foot zodiac now ?  what the hell.. its an inflatable..
555331,spinnerbaitking,2011-02-25 07:58:00,1622,"I don't think I'll be getting to excited about this, who's going to enforce it, next they'll want us to register or float tubes SBK"
555351,Old Man,2011-02-25 13:32:00,822,"The governments are all saying that Canadians are getting too fat, then come up with the idea to make them pay $50 to register the canoe's and kayaks. What a bunch of idiots.Obviously, some senior bureaucrat in Transport Canada is missing the point and needs to have a good A$$ kicking."
555352,Jer,2011-02-25 13:39:00,1426,  It' supposed to make us jump up & down repeatedly shaking our fist & flipping the bird...that's some good cardio-vascular...
555357,irishfield,2011-02-25 13:48:00,26272,Read the TC regs before going off half co cked guys. Guide/leader boat only of paid/commercial operations. None of the boats following it need to be registered nor does yours. Been there since 2007 and similar to charter boat tracking/registering. Another way of tracking legitament businesses....
555370,umKthxbye,2011-02-25 14:58:00,247, Exactly! Worded perfectly.
555373,Jonny,2011-02-25 15:05:00,1380," It may be something that's been around for a bit, but it looks like most people don't know about it.  It's just the idea of it being done at all --- the thin edge of the wedge. Have you ever heard of a regulation being scrapped?  Leading one to ask... WHY?  Legitimate businesses can be tracked by business registration and income tax.  This would be a much better country if we had a law that says... for every new regulation that's made, two others have to be taken off the books.   "
555399,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-25 16:36:00,835,Good to know that if you send your kids to camp the one inspected boat is the one the guide is in. If all the others sink he can rescue the kids.
555414,Jonny,2011-02-25 17:37:00,1380," I get the sarcasm, but the boats are never inspected. I've bought and sold quite a number of registered boats and nobody has ever inspected one. They just want the money."
555419,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-25 18:03:00,835,Doesn't the vessel have to be inspected to be registered? When my bud had his houseboat registered it was inspected and when my other bud built a toon for use at a kid's camp it was inspected and tested for buoyancy. Granted after the first inspection its probably never looked at again.
