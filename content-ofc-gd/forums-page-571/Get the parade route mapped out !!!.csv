555361,ricoboxing,2011-02-25 14:10:00,398,i think the only parade that leafs fans are going to this summer is that one on church street
555362,solopaddler,2011-02-25 14:13:00,8605, Could you translate that please?
555365,Harrison,2011-02-25 14:23:00,2202,"I ran into Brian Burke walking through the ACC a few days ago around lunch time.  Just off the cuff I said ""I think you are doing great things"" He smiled and said "" I am trying, thanks""  Here's hoping!!!  That man has a great head of hair."
555368,stubbex1,2011-02-25 14:49:00,164,"    lol its a fishing forum, i had to keep it fishy"
555375,solopaddler,2011-02-25 15:12:00,8605, That really helped a lot.  For some reason I'm picturing Borat.
555376,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 15:12:00,4399," That`s Newfie Mike, you don`t speak Newfie?"
555378,Roy,2011-02-25 15:24:00,13728,"Yeah ""like sleeve of wizard"""
555380,Governator,2011-02-25 15:26:00,879,"It was a great game, at least for fans.  Exciting all the way through.  Sure they are within 4 pts of a playoff berth, but they have a VERY challenging schedule for the 2 weeks.  5 of their next 7 games include pittsburgh twice, philly twice & chicago.  That stretch will be due or die, if they can get through that without too much damage I'll be impressed."
555381,jedimaster,2011-02-25 15:40:00,3472,"Its gonna be a big weekend for the Leafs Playoff dreams, Carolina, plays Pits and Montreal - Both road games for carolina so expect a 2 game slide Buffalo Plays Detroit and Ottawa Back to back - Expect a win against Nottawa Slothators Atlanta plays Florida and Toronto - I would expect a win against Florida, also contending  I am guessing a loss to Pits, and a win against Atlanta. This will set them up for next week being in 9th place and ready for a full out charge next week. If Burke can pick up a goal scorer or a puck moving D, I think we have a good building block for next year and a possible run for next year  "

555385,[emailÂ protected],2011-02-25 15:57:00,119, The only reason Leaf fans would be there is to see which of the Habs are going to be cutting the ribbon and carrying the (rainbow) flag......
555386,Governator,2011-02-25 16:00:00,879," Yea although that's only counting 2 games for the leafs, it's going to be a tough stretch of games for them regardless.  Also it might be hard to believe but you still can't count out the Devils at this stage.  They are a mega long shot sure but they are playing like champs right now.  They've won like 8 or 9 in a row and will leap frog Atlanta & Florida in the next week I'm sure."
555388,jedimaster,2011-02-25 16:04:00,3472,Yah the devils are the dark horse and charging fast.

555513,tb4me,2011-02-26 00:01:00,3295,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Awesome shirt!
555562,Oggie,2011-02-26 02:03:00,588,Pittsburgh is too banged up to give Carolina any kind of game. Too Bad! What's with putting the backup in half way through the second period!  Talk about mailing it in!  Ottawa isn't helping the cause either.  Dan O.
555567,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-26 02:21:00,4399,  This one is pretty good too!!!   
555619,jedimaster,2011-02-26 14:31:00,3472,
555620,jedimaster,2011-02-26 14:33:00,3472,Well let's hope the leafs on a days rest can give it to the pens tonight on a back to back.
555277,walleyejack,2011-02-25 03:17:00,358,Phil the pill comes through again with a 4pt night.And a stellar effort again by Riemer.
555278,irishfield,2011-02-25 03:18:00,26272,It's gotta go down Bay St.. 'cause that's where Joe and Geoff store the baracades !!!
555281,solopaddler,2011-02-25 03:24:00,8605,"No one is planning parade routes.  They're within 4 points of the playoffs which a month ago seemed unfathomable.  Great game by Bozak, that was nice to see.  Really nice to stick it to the Habs in their building in a game they wanted just as much."
555283,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 03:26:00,4399,Leafs were full value for the win but I must say not one of the best officiated games that I have seen for both sides ie. the nice play the Gionta made lifting the leaf players stick and stealing the puck and one of the door knobs calls Gionta for hooking!!!  Leafs March schedule looks tough!  Johnny Bass must be doing back flips!!!
555284,tb4me,2011-02-25 03:27:00,3295,"Awesome game.. I was shocked to see the leafs take control in the last minute.they usually go into defend o mode. Anyway good game bozak, I also think komi had his best game in a long time. Logging some big minutes lately. Go Leafs Go!!!"

555289,BUSTER,2011-02-25 03:31:00,1336,Oh ya it's still on when baseball starts and the tulips bloom.
555290,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 03:31:00,4399," First games back off a western road trip are usually tough so the outcome was no surprise to me, what surprised me was Auld playing and then the coach pulling him   if you were going to do that you   why didn`t you just start Price in the first place, you didn`t need to spot the Leafs 3!"
555292,solopaddler,2011-02-25 03:34:00,8605, Lame excuse Gord.
555294,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 03:39:00,4399,  I thought it was pretty good!!!
555295,kickingfrog,2011-02-25 03:43:00,8333,Lose- Say little. Win- Say less.
555296,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 03:43:00,4399,"The worst part of it is I have to listen to the Bull tomorrow at work, when the Leafs lose 14 in a row these guys are no where to be found but beat the Habs and these clowns are strutting around the office like peacocks!!!"
555297,walleyejack,2011-02-25 03:44:00,358,Phaneuf had a bad hair day again.
555298,solopaddler,2011-02-25 03:46:00,8605, Habs fans are just as annoying don't kid yourself.
555299,otter649,2011-02-25 03:46:00,118,Last game of the season for both teams is in Toronto - The Habs will probably have a playoff position secured by then but for The Leafs who knows. So it could/should be an interesting game if the game means a playoff position for either Toronto or Montreal........
555300,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-25 03:46:00,2690,"I was totally surprised by the Leafs last 2 1/2 minutes!  The three minutes prior to that, in which the Habs scored one goal, were mass panic.  Looked like they were going to give up at least one point for sure, but, they played an amazing couple of minutes.  So nice to see, at least things are getting interesting"
555309,jedimaster,2011-02-25 03:55:00,3472,"I love when the leafs obliterate the Habs.... Hahahaha solid game all around. Phil,Bo,Luke, and reimer looking more steady every game. Big mistake starting auld. I may have to watch the sens sabers game tomorrow and route for the sens.... Damn..."
555311,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-25 04:00:00,4399,  Thats just those K`becer Hab fans!!  I`m a sweetheart!!!
555315,ADB,2011-02-25 04:12:00,444,"Much needed win tonight...we couldn't afford to give away the two points.  Leafs haters really amaze me.  Last time I checked, being in 10th place, 4 points out of the playoffs, with 21 games to go means you're right in the thick of the playoff race.  But because its the Leafs...  I'm not saying that they will make it or that they won't make it, but anyone who thinks they don't have a somewhat realistic chance is delusional."
555319,danc,2011-02-25 04:24:00,4677,I'll have a talk with Phaneuf about this in a couple of weeks.
555321,solopaddler,2011-02-25 04:41:00,8605,  Uh oh. We're screwed.
555348,kickingfrog,2011-02-25 13:21:00,8333, :rofl2:
555350,JohnF,2011-02-25 13:31:00,3494, They're just being good sports. I think they wanna have a parade for our boys just for making the playoffs. That's very sporting.  JF
