542750,misfish,2011-01-23 16:45:00,29133, Jumping on the JR bandwagon this year J 2011 is going to be his year.
542752,danc,2011-01-23 16:47:00,4677, LOL Without a doubt Brian.
542758,Joey,2011-01-23 17:06:00,9122," Ummmmmm, no"
542760,Garnet,2011-01-23 17:12:00,2056,Jr needs to put up. Any other driver would be driving for front row furniture.
542761,misfish,2011-01-23 17:14:00,29133, JR needs to drive for Childress. Thats all there is to it.  He is still the fans #1 guy. Just like the leafs.They dont win but have faithful followers.LOL
542762,Daplumma,2011-01-23 17:16:00,1961,I'm in.Jr will not be a factor..again!
542811,Bernie,2011-01-23 18:59:00,3190,"Jr likes to drive up next to the wall. That way when he spins out it doesn't hit as hard. He's lost his nerve. And really, he has all the money he'll ever need. He may as well quit and let somebody in the seat that wants to drive. Don't get me wrong, he's OK, but I think his glory days are over. New crew chief? Don't think it will help. He's had several good ones over the years."
542887,misfish,2011-01-23 22:14:00,29133," Man does he ever like the wall.Scares me like no get out. I know theres speed up there,but like you said,less of a hurt if he spins and hit it.Still that pop death factor in his head Im sure.He can race when in the top 3-5,but once he,s back in the pack,hes not in the comfort zone. I still believe he needs Childress. Guide him like his pop.Richard knows racing.Strongly believe that Richard can put him in that comfort zone.Hendrich is just using the name of Earnhart.Plain and simple.Sad really. He,s a great driver,just needs guidenst."
555146,misfish,2011-02-24 19:58:00,29133,"Got an email to get my guys ready for the weekend.  OH MY,AMAGINE IF JR HAD FINISHED TOP 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just say,n."
