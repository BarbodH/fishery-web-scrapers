555566,chris.brock,2011-02-26 02:20:00,4053,"thanks, I tried that and surprisingly it stayed in the same mode"
555568,HTHM,2011-02-26 02:22:00,4082,Take the batteries out of the remaote??
555569,chris.brock,2011-02-26 02:25:00,4053,"my wife figured it out, she doesn't know how she did it(search button?) but got it done, thanks guys"
555571,mercman,2011-02-26 02:33:00,7054," Who muffed it up, you or the wife"
555575,kickingfrog,2011-02-26 03:04:00,8333,"I know it's fix now but this might help in the future:  With our expressvu remote if you press the guide button after you are in the guide mode it will cycle through different channel options, such as ""all channels"", ""all subscribed channels"", ""all HD"" and then any favourite channel subsets."
555593,lew,2011-02-26 11:01:00,12766,Life used to be so simple when we only had 4 channels and you changed them by turning  a little dial on the front of the TV set
555617,bigmac1984,2011-02-26 14:16:00,193,You are exactly right Kickingfrog.... I've had expressview a long time and that is easily done.
