555604,Billy Bob,2011-02-26 12:22:00,5865,"Remember, the price of gas & oil is dictated by the open market.......Isn't this the way you want it......if you don't like the price of gas now purchase some oil stocks....if you can't beat them, join them."
555632,wjw,2011-02-26 15:38:00,35,"I try to stay away from politics but I've heard Obama say twice that he feels a good price for gasoline is $5.00 a gallon. He feels that this would put the U.S. more in line with the rest of the world.  If he truely believes this he is a fool.  If you want to kill the ecomony, raise gasoline. It affects everything.  Goldman Sacs, which has very close ties to Obama, is the prime ""driver"" of rising gas prices. They make a prediction as to where oils futures are headed and oil shoots up $3.00 a barrel. There is no oil shortage. The big money is controlling the futures market (George Soros & friends). When they get the prices high enough, they dump their holdings and screw the small investor. If the futures market was required to take possession of the product they were speculating on, the problem would be solved.  My $.02"

555066,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-24 15:47:00,2690," See, Bob...it goes like this...here in Canada we constantly vote in governments that screw over the people. Doesn't matter what party, Liberal, PC, NDP, they all do it.  We could be self sufficient in our gas, but, we sell it THEN buy it back (last time I checked anyways). I love being a Canadian, but, I have no respect for our governments, and, the way we get ""hosed"" over and over."

555075,Governator,2011-02-24 16:26:00,879,"We don't sell our oil and buy it back.  We HAVE To ship our oil to the US, it's part of the NAFTA agreement we signed.  We have to distribute our oil/gas equally with the states and their demand is higher than ours so they get more.  Most of the remaining oil stays on the West side of Canada as we don't have pipelines to get it to the East.  40% or more of Ontario's oil is imported (Not from the States last I checked).  We certainly have more than enough of oil for all of Canada but there are no energy plans in place here to utilize it."

555088,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-24 17:06:00,10439,I checked the price of gas here after seeing this thread yesterday and it seems our price went up 9 cents a liter since Friday. We're still not that bad though at $1.259 a liter.

No Grocery store.. no tackle shop as Jim has closed for good. If you need a fishing licence be sure to stop back at Angus Lake at Gramps to get one.. Mind you, do you plan to do any fishing? LOL"
555192,bigugli,2011-02-24 22:16:00,6138,Found gas for $1.08 today. One small victory in a cheaper run to Simcoe. Government isn't going to run to our rescue. Gotta learn to fend for ourselves like in the old days.

After finding out my son was rushed to ER late yesterday afternoon I found out he was OK...they think. Then filled the tank up for $1.14 litre at the Woodward Av., Hamilton Pioneer. All the others were 1.21 - 1.22, even the Pioneer a few blocks from that one was over a buck 21."

555006,lew,2011-02-24 13:12:00,12766,"I was watching the Toronto news this morning and they mentioned that because of the recent troubles in the Middle East, gas prices have risen about 6 cents a litre in Toronto in the last couple days .  That's about 27 cents a gallon.  I then switched to an American channel and they said that because of the same troubles in the Middle East gas prices in the States have risen, on average, about 8 cents per gallon.  27 cents per gallon increase  here...  8 cents per gallon increase in the States...  A Canadian gallon is only about 20% bigger than an American gallon but our increase is about 3 1/2 times more.  I just found that rather interesting."
555009,BUSTER,2011-02-24 13:19:00,1336,$1.21 liter here this morn

555016,Handlebarz,2011-02-24 13:58:00,3790,Yep $108 here yesterday morning then $115 yesterday morning. I have not seen today but a friend said its now $120 WTH this is just not right close to over season boarders and use our own fuel I would rather pay $150 for North American oil then $120 for Bull foreign oil
555021,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-24 14:06:00,4399,  And when you consider the beaver buck is basically at par with greenback Lew you can imagine how much money these scumbag oil companies are pulling in to say nothing of the scumbag politicians that let them get away with it!!!
555025,lew,2011-02-24 14:13:00,12766," And lets not forget the additional 8% Mr. McLiar jammed us with recentely, but I believe he said something about that being for our own good ??"
555026,Governator,2011-02-24 14:13:00,879,"When the prices shoot up, I go to torontogasprices.com - You can search any city and will tell u the price of gas at all the stations that members have reported (and how long ago that was).  Cool site when you're looking to save a buck or two."

555032,bigbuck,2011-02-24 14:23:00,2449,"Where is the PM from??? There will be no meaningful reform in our fuel supply as long as Calgary is calling the shots. The Chretien government let the refiners and oil companies get rid of their competition (the individual gas station owners) and the whole retail structure was reworked to suit them. I never could figure out how that was supposed to be good for the consumer. There are fewer refineries which are artificially tightening the gasoline supply. Now I don't blame the oil companies for not wanting to spend billions on new refineries when the internal combustion engine may be going the way of the dodo bird in the next 25-50 years or sooner. We are getting hosed and there is nothing we can do about it. Saudi Arabia has 4 million barrels/day of excess capacity capability so really, Libya shouldn't really affect the market as much as it has with 1.6 million barrels/day of output. I think with all the unrest in the Middle East, we can expect oil prices to continue upwards and gas prices to do likewise. Unfortunately for us, who really knows what kind of regimes are going to take power in these countries. The people there in all likelihood whon't be any better off than they are now."
555034,Roy,2011-02-24 14:26:00,13728,Highest here is 126.9. Lowest is 115.9. What's interesting is that they're both Ultramar...I guess someone's not getting the memos eh?
555036,perchslayer666,2011-02-24 14:28:00,280,"Too bad they have not developed a way to cleanly produce petroleum on a larger scale from our Canadian oil sands (largest bitumen deposits in the world) and have to rely on middle eastern oil due to its light sweet characteristics.  Another factor would be our love for large gas guzzling vechicles.... Did you know in 2010 Ford sold over 90,000 F Series trucks in Canada alone???? These are trucks with a minimum 98 liter gas tank....  Combined with increased demand from across the world for gas (eg. China, India ect...) It's no wonder when an Arab sneezes prices for us will increase.  We can't have it both ways guys."
555039,jimmer,2011-02-24 14:32:00,2730,Here in Ontario it's a race between the oil companies and Hydro to see who can break us first! It all adds up and will eventually cut into my ability to go fishing as much as I do. That's bad for a fishing addict!
555043,addy79,2011-02-24 14:42:00,573,"It's not so much the unrest in places like Libya that throws our gas prices up, our gas prices are affected more by speculative day traders than what is happening in Libya. All their oil goes to Europe...  It doesn't help that they tax the crap out of our fuel at the pumps either.  somethings gotta give but it never does! The kicker is that all this speculation drives prices up, however, there is NO correction, EVER! argh!!!"
555044,Billy Bob,2011-02-24 14:42:00,5865,With all the oil fields in Canada and it's need to build it's population you would think a max of $2 per gallon and many would flock to Canada to live and work.

555046,GBW,2011-02-24 14:44:00,8460,It went up 10C last night to 1.219 where I am.
555048,Governator,2011-02-24 14:50:00,879,"I could be wrong but as far as I know due to NAFTA, Canada exports more oil to the states than any other country (Including Saudi Arabia).  We have to legally give them (for the rest of our known lives) something like 75% of our oil.  Basically oil in North America must be divided up to the highest consumers which of course is mainly the States."
555049,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-24 14:51:00,2690,"You can all blame me for this one.  Got my new truck two days ago...I said as soon as I go back to a V-8 gas would go up (Murphy's Law)  Seriously, though, you raise a good point.  Once again, us Canadians get hosed."
555050,Roy,2011-02-24 14:56:00,13728," So why are we called ""Hosers""? We should be called ""Hozees""!"
