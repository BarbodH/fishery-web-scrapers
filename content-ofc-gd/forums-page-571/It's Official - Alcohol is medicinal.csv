Meaning.. 2 ounces of (Brandy,Whiskey,Tequilla,Vodka,Gin etc..) every 2 hours taken orally during waking hours. So long as provided by family or self.. and must be in a plastic bottle.  It's mostly prescribed to terminal alcoholics during their stay at the hospice or LTC facility.  *That's like a 26'er or more a day... but I'm glad that the province isn't paying for it.  Randy "
