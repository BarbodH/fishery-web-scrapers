Been looking for a new house    doing the necessary Spring Fishing Show, and grinding it out on the toughest ice season I can remember.  We're still getting fish every trip but its been a grind, and havent had a stellar day in a few weeks.  February blues, we're almost through it.  We've had the majority of our success in shallower water 70-82 feet for both whities and lakers.  Hot baits have been Williams 1/2&1/2, Strike Zone Slammer on a 3/8oz bullethead and a lighter Michigan Stinger spoon when they're really off the bite.  The slower fall and flutter seems to get them going. No videos this time, just some pics, and I'll be adding some more this afternoon.  Enjoy them, if you have any questions, feel free to ask here or PM me.  Hope to see some familiar faces at the Fishing For Tyler event tomorrow! Weather looks good!       "
