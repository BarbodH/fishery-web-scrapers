Should be a good day tomorrow, it would appear that perch have moved out of the deep stuff and have been replaced with whities and herring in the area we fished this week (about time LOL).  Lots of marks on the graph, a few missed fish and a few landed. Soft jigging and plastics did it today, but buddies were out yesterday and hit double digits of fish on spoons, same area. Travel will be great, cars, trucks (except my RAM Mega Cab, LOL) ATVS, and sleds all over the lake(IBR area) use cation though.  Watch the pressure cracks to the North. Tried to show the conditions in the pics.  Have fun out there,"
