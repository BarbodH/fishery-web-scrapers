555492,dave524,2011-02-25 22:34:00,4508," At almost 61 quite a few things fit in that category. My first computer was a 386 with a whopping 127 MB. hard drive, no internet just a 2400 baud connection to a local BBS, paid $1700 for it too , now a 29 dollar mp3 player has way more memory. Fishfinders are a bargain, outfitting a salmon boat 30 years ago I bought the best there was, a Lowrance 1510B paper graph, paid more for it than a new HDS5 and it ate a 5 dollar roll of paper a weekend, the kicker used less in gas  . TV's, pretty sure I paid over 300 for a new 20"" portable in the late 70's and don't even think what a new VCR cost then   Cable was only $8 a month, now there's a big ripoff Majour appliances are a deal, when I bought a house in 83 I bought new fridge stove washer dryer, basic units that could be replaced today for very close to what I paid. The house is another story, thank you real estate values Retired at 58, luckily I was able to save early in my worklife when you actually got decent interest rates, but if mortgage rates ever hit today what they were then, the banks would own half the homes in town.

555498,knightfisher,2011-02-25 23:23:00,237,"While I agree getting a career as opposed to just a job makes sense, there are not enough jobs out there for the thousands of ''yearly'' graduates who have that piece of paper. Also, not everyone is capable of getting a career. Just don't have ability required. Not everyone is smart enough to be (..........) There are very few other jobs for the ones who can't find career type jobs. Whats happening around the world as far as protests go, will come here. It's already happening to a degree in the States. However with what we experienced with the G-20 a while back, will people be allowed to speak their mind and protest.

Keep your old appliances, or buy reconditioned when you can.Energy Star is a figment of your imagination.20 cu ft fridges with 1/5 hp Compressors waste energy trying to keep your stuff cold or frozen. They should be 1/4 or 1/3 minimum.So you see, they want you to think you are saving money, but you are really not in the long run.Energy costs are higher, and you have to go through 3 sets of appliances instead of only 1. I KNOW THIS. After 30 years in the appliance parts bussiness, i see it all, and am in contact with the manufacturers like whirlpool, GE,Electrolux and LG, on a level you wouldnt believe. What they do should be illegal, and in many cases it is, but we(the consumers) have no idea.  Sorry to ramble. Keep your money in your pockets.Repair yourself, and dont let sales people fill your ears with crap."

Everyone my age (35- 36) have no retirement plans...Im self employed and have no way to save either.. were having a hard enough time making ends meet every month. The wife works at the local drugstore. She has good bennifets but no retirement plan either. Were just simply not making enough to be able to save. I see a horrific trend here.

Got them beginning of May 2010 as chicks.  $2.00 each.  Cheap.  Chick feed is cheap too and they don't eat much.  They didn't start laying eggs until October when they were almost 6 months old.  But the bigger they got, the more they ate.  I was getting 10 to 12 eggs per day.  When winter came and the day length lessened, they stopped laying eggs every day.  Now I get 5 to 8 per day.  A 50-lb bag of egg layer pellets cost $12.  They eat one bag a week.  Do the math.  You'll never get your money back.  But you're right.  They are fun."

555611,spincast,2011-02-26 13:31:00,3279,"""CEOs Are Overpaid  CEOs are paid too much for what they do; too much more than their average worker By F. John Reh, About.com Guide   Pay for Performance According to Business Week, the average CEO of a major corporation made 42 times the average hourly worker's pay in 1980. By 1990 that had almost doubled to 85 times. In 2000, the average CEO salary reached an unbelievable 531 times that of the average hourly worker.""  Somehow, I think this may be contributing to the erosion of the middle class -  I believe recent comparison indicates that by 10:00 am on Jan 1st the average CEO has made the same amount of money the average worker does by Dec 31st in the calendar year.  And while the above is definitely a contributing factor, much of the  current condition (high tax rates, deteriorating infrastructure etc) is also caused by the fact that, for most of our lives the word balanced budget has been an unrealised goal for most western countries. Politicans have behaved in a way with our tax dollars that we would never behave with our personal credit. How many years can you max out your credit (cards, lines of credit payday loans)  and increase the limit? Eventually you gotta pay it all back. Anyone look real close at the ""how long it will take to pay off your credit card if you make minimum payments"" on your monthly statement?

It points out that while the price of things has gone up...people's income has too.  When adjusted for inflation the price of most consumer goods in relation to average income has remained relatively unchanged for the last half century or so.  Like I say, I wish I could find it because the author provided all kinds of examples that showed the inflation-adjusted price of all lot of things is almost exactly the same today as it's been in each previous decade going back to the 50s and 60s.  I can even think of a few things that have gotten cheaper.  Look at your computer.  The first one I bought was a used Pentium II and I paid $1700 for it in the mid 90's."
555225,tnt,2011-02-25 00:18:00,63,"What makes me laugh is when I do my best to conserve, the utilities follow suit claiming they aren't making enough to maintain there facilities.....guess what that means....rates go up.  I have cut back so much on water usage I'm afraid I can't reduce it anymore.  I never wash my vehicle, I don't water my lawn, I don't flush every time I do a #1...my sewage fee's are somehow more than my water used....not sure how that works.  And now I pay the same as I did 2 years ago when I wasn't in conservation mode.  I actually heard something about the hydro company being charged for levying interested charges against customers that were too high.  I forget how much the fine was but they have said rates will be going up to assist in paying the fines???????  How is that right.  I am 35 yrs old, there are many out there in my age range that have jobs with no pensions.  CPP yeah what is that gonna do if it's still around when I turn 65.  How will I ever be able to put my son through post secondary school when rates jump up so frequently.  I got a raise this year....40 cents and hour.....doesn't compare with the increases in utilities, groceries, insurance rates and everything else mentioned.

I hear yeah Misfish, unfortunately I know many people that can't afford to plan for the future.  Can't afford luxuries some of us take for granted.

My wages sure haven't doubled. I guess I could have lived in a shoe box and just put every cent I earned working two jobs into the bank so that when I can't work anymore I could afford to live in a shoe box. It has taken everything I have in me to pay my bills and support my family. i have never lived on welfair but from what I have seen, I might as well have, I know others that have and I'm not much better off than some of them.  It would be easy if I could plan a budget where if I need more I just take it but today our fearless leaders just give themselves raises and pat themselves on the back and tell us they need more money to give us the services we want."

I hear ya on the rest of it.. I pay $1200 a MONTH for property taxes in this little town they call Penetang.. and it's time to pack up, sell and move.. but to where? A similarly valued property in Mississauga would pay $2100 a YEAR. We're about 7 times the mill rate of Mississauga here."

I have 2 pension plans that became worthless when the employers went bankrupt Seems government put a few loopholes in place to allow employers to borrow against their pension funds. The third one I pulled and put into a ""secure""  pension plan. The insurance company has locked down the fund and made no payouts in 2 years as the recession almost wiped it out. So I planned and saved and still don't have squat. Or you can put all your savings in the bank and get no return either."

SUV [my daily comuter] dies in the next year and a half (almost at 400 000kms) I will buy a little 4.7L /100km 5 door car.  At some point I can't do anything more, and will continue to fall behind compared to where I was 2 years ago.  I will see that I and my family are ok, that I promise.  But what is really worries me is wheather my children (very young right now) will have a similar lifestyle to me, or even a reasonable one at that.  Education, Housing, Transportation, Energy, Insurance, etc. 20 years from now ??  I hope they stand a chance.  ? Entropy ?"
555267,knightfisher,2011-02-25 02:55:00,237,"Excellent post/s Cliff I'm close to the same situation, less the water front property.  For the most part, our kids and grandkids will only have what we leave them. But will they make enough to maintain them. The jobs are not there. The economic climate is very dismal at best. With corporations outsourcing as much as they can, moving entire operations to third world countries, we are in bad, very bad.  With a few exceptions, only the public sector is doing well. And very well protected. For now. The middle class, which is weaning away at an alarming rate are the ones paying for these public workers. An economy can not sustain itself in the service industry. It has to produce something of value. Well, so very much of this production is being done in other countries. Look at how much our steel and car industry has shrunk and moved out, over the last 25 years.  It can't go on much longer. Looks what happened in Greece, what's going on in Wisconnsin in the States. The public are being taxed to death and every single state is borrowing money to make ends meet. Happening here in Canada as well. How many billions are we in debt here in Ontario. The middle class is being erroded away.  Very high cost of living, food, gas, heat, hydro etc.  The jobs are not there, and there not coming back !!!!  I remember growing up in Hamilton in the 60s and 70s. The jobs were a plenty. You chose where you wanted to work. It was great. There were soooo many factory jobs, I would be hired basically the same day I quit from a previous job. It was great. I had opportunities to take government jobs but decided against that. humm  I left that field, and started my home improvement business. I wanted more of a challenge. Great move. I really enjoyed, and still do leaving a mark, whether it's a house I bricked, or a bell tower on a church I rebuilt, It will be there for a hundred years. It's a personal reward being in the line of work I'm in. And it's always a pleasure meeting the public I worked for and bumping into them later and having a quick chat.  However I don't have the great pensions and drug plans that my friends have who stayed put in the factories, and or government jobs. And sometimes I wonder if I should of continued to work in factories, because these guys are further ahead financially than I. Note--I am not demeaning factory work, I just wanted to try something else. My retirement will be tight, and if worse come worse, I sell my house. Got to do, what you got to do.  I really fear for the up coming generations, they will be working like our parents did, saving every cent they can. On a plus side, hopefully it will bring families back closer together, like back in the 60s, but that's another story.  Dan"
555287,danc,2011-02-25 03:29:00,4677,"I think that the lesson to be learnd here is to choose your career wisely and to plan for your retirement. The two go hand in hand. Don't just go out and get a job. Get a career. Earn a piece of paper that says that you are qualified to do something. My peice of paper has kept me working full time for 34 years. I'll never be out of a good paying job. I might have to travel and make sacrifices, but I'll never starve and I'll retire before 60. I didn't catch a Brook Trout last year for the first time in decades, but I made a very good living sacrificing that. I think that my priorieties are in order."
555306,mercman,2011-02-25 03:54:00,7054,"You are a lucky man Dan. For most of us its too late to get that piece of paper though. We have struggled and changed jobs hoping to make enough to support our famillies. And for every young person today, who has gone to school and college to get that pieces of paper, there are 1000 already in line, holding that piece of paper, hoping beyond hope to get that job. I know it looks grim, but we are all gonna make it.The rise and fall of our economy comes and goes in cycles driven by politics, and banks.When our economy gets too strong on the international markets, the Gov, and the Central bank raise or lower intrest rates to increase or decrease spending trends. Things will get better, you can count on it"

555429,Cookslav,2011-02-25 18:53:00,1457,"Cost of living increases vr. the cost of living is the issue not the ability to remain working. I have several peices of paper that keep me working and I'm not worried about me.... Perhaps my abilty to retire comfortably comes into the equasion on occassion but I definatly fear for the future of my kids, and my parents.  I can work, and the more I work, the more income I can earn...thats a no brainer. But for retiree's that not a feasable or fair situation to perceive as a solution to rising costs. Their cost of living increases with the rest of us and their hard earned savings get depleted faster.  Lets face it....wage increases are no were near the cost of living increases we see year to year for us working folk. Imagine how the retiree's feel about this. All I know is by the time my 6 year old Daughter is in the work force she'll have to be a doctor to make ends meet.  Its a frustrating situation and if I had an easy solution I'd lay it on the table but I don't.  I know I put 15% of my income away for retirement every week, And I bought my first house at the ripe age of 23 for $115,000...I fixed it up my self replacing all the windows, floors, Roof, A/C furnace, and added a fireplace, and counteless cosmetics like french doors, and kitchen cabinets etc... I flipped that house 5 years later for $220,000. I put that money back into a 2 year old 3000 squarefoot home, and finished the basment, paved a drive way added a deck, fence, Shed, water softener, Wet bar and Fireplace increasing the equity an additional $65,000 over the last 3 years....this house will be sold as part of my retirement when the kids are out of the house. I did did this all myself while working a demanding job that requires me to work on average 50 hours/ week and sometime over 60 hours a week. I'm doing ALL I can to be prepared for retirement....but one thing I have to ask...  Should it be this hard to earn a comforatble retirement? Should I have to work 50-60 hours a week, and then have a second job renovating and flipping homes to simply be able to enjoy the golden years? Do we need to sacrafice quality time with our familys to afford 10-15 years of comfort while we're young enough to enjoy it? My Grand father worked a factory job with Labatts....40 hours a week, with 5 kids and retired comfortabley with a lake front cottage in sauble beach and nice home in kitchener. All done on an ""average joe's"" factory salary and no post secondary eductation.  I on the other hand did a 4 year apprenticship followed by 2 years of school. then went back for another 2 years for another certification, and still work 50-60 hours a week, and spend my off time trying to get futher ahead Striving to keep that same level of living....I have a home, and travel trailer for now and only three kids. I make 5 times the money my Grandfather did, and a cottage is still Years and years away if even possible. And last year my Grandmother sold the family cottage because she couldn't afford it any longer....  We're sliding...plain and simple Its not our abilty to work persay, its the cost of living thats out of whack. One could even argue that the lack of available work is directly effected by the cost of living.... How bad is it when some people make MORE or similar money sitting on their butts though welfare, and EI then the jobs available are able to pay?  Time for some serious reforms if you ask me. Time for Government to make some changes on the taxation structures, and instead of standardizing minimum wage increases....how about some Energy, gas & Water price standardizations? How about addressing the farmers concerns about the financial impacts of importing foods as opposed to home grown.  bah...I'm just a dreamer I guess."

We did however, find a way to pay off our mortgage in our early 50's, then thinking that we could retire or semi-retire early, before we reached 60. That has probably all changed now and we're not even sure if we will be able to retire at 65. Unless of course we decide to sell our home and use that to subsidize our retirement and go live in a trailer. Go figure, worked hard all these years to be debt free, but then not be able to keep up with the normal monthly bills. Something has to give. We're sure not getting raises to keep up with the cost of living. So, who ever mentioned in a previous post to make sure to choose the right career, was bang on.

We save ~30% of our income, no cable TV or home phone to try to keep monthly costs in check.  We also installed a very high efficiency furnace and a/c unit and completed the Eco-Energy retrofit program on our 900 sq ft bungalow upgrading windows, toilets, faucets & showers with low-flo heads, insulated front steel entrance door, attic insulation, etc and it still seems that our utility bills are sky high!  I think Cliff hit the nail on the head when he said that with all the energy efficient appliances and light bulbs, etc the demand has dropped off huge.  When demand drops the cost of supply must be increased to maintain profits.  Good luck to everyone, we're gonna need it!        "
555453,mercman,2011-02-25 20:17:00,7054,"Here are some little tips to help some of you save a few bucks.Dont wash your clothes in cold water, like most companies suggest. A) it is extremely hard on the washer.The cold water causes the plastic in the machine to become hard and wear out faster. The soap will not disolve properly(even liquid soap) and will ruin hoses and pumps and seals  When you put the ice cold clothing in your dryer, it will take up to 4 times more energy to dry those clothes, than if you washed in warm or hot water.  C) In winter, buy yourself an Indoor dryer vent kit, and where possible, evacuate the air from your dryer inside.It will provide humidity and a pleasant smell from the fabric softener.Also, it will not pull the air from your warm house and send it out side.

Only a fool believes that a politician will change that time honored formula. Politicians are either well off of their own accord, or they have been bought and paid for by the corporate world. How else do they pay for lavish election campaigns and high priced advisors and analysts. Not by selling membership cards. I just find that in today's economic climate, I am applying a lot more of my grandparent's wisdom and advice. They got through the depression and WWII, so I guess I can manage too. Rule number 1: Trust no government or corporation, because none have your best interest at heart."

Another factor is the poor are treated better in this era getting assistance such as welfare and increased minimum wages which is great But the Middle class is getting hosed paying for it on the same level as the rich.  We're headed down a dangerous road right now...the rich get richer and more tax breaks, while the middle class get pushed into poverty. and no releif in site....sad but true  Just wait until the Interest Rates skyrocket...

Our parents had to scrimp and save and really, we haven't, not even close. There were times when it may have been a bit tight but it didn't last too long. There has been too much money available and now the majority of people are overextending themselves. I'm not just talking about the average working stiff either. In my house, we eat steak, roasts, ribs, chicken, fish and the like very regularly, how you may ask?? I don't make $200k/yr. Every Saturday morning I have my ritual, while the fishing shows are on, I go through the ads for the week. Over the course of the week during my travels, I will stop at the various stores to pick up the specials along with some of the basic staples, bread, milk eggs and the like. I have a freezer that is very well stocked in the basement as well as a well stocked pantry of dry goods. Why buy a can of tomatoes for $1.49 when you can get them for .88 each on special. Buy a dozen or two. Why pay $7.99 or higher per pound for a Prime rib roast when you can get it for $3.99/lb? You just have to be a smart shopper. That's what our folks did.

Worse thing a young person (19-25) can do IMO, is get a NEW car.  Total waste of money.  Buy used and sock the rest of what would of been your new payment into a savings account for a house.  I wish I had that advice.  I do the exact same.  I get all the flyers on thurs eve, I go through everyone and price match at Walmart.  Yep, Walmart.  I hunt down all the ""loss leaders"" from other stores and stock up.  It is work, but for the hour I spend I can save close to a hundred bucks, not bad for an hours work.  As for the debt, I went old school 2 years ago, don't have the money, you don't get it. Plain and simple.  It's tough, but that ""financial"" stress is GONE!  Highly recommended.  We have no bail out in our future.  Fortunate there is no daycare either, she is a stay at home Mom.  Good post bigbuck."

Canned sockeye a $1 a can, grabbed the last 8 off the shelf. I still buy large hunks of meat to break down into roasts, steaks, chops, stewing portions. 20lbs for $20 goes a long way.

555163,Big Cliff,2011-02-24 20:49:00,6899,"As I read so many of the replies the trend seems to be consistant for the most part ""we have to cut back""!  Well, you are right in many cases; we cut back on our hydro usage by putting in CFC bulbs, turning off the computer when we aren't using it, doing laundry etc. during non peak periods, un plugging cell phone chargers when not in use and putting in high efficiency appliances where ever we could to name a few things. Oh but wait, Hydro isn't getting the revenu they were before so now they have to put our hydro cost up to compensate. Good deal if you can get it, provide less, charge more.  When I start to look at what I am paying for things: phone/TV $112.00/month that's $1,120.00 a year. Wasn't that many years ago the only cost I had for TV was the cost of the TV set. True, I didn't have as many chanels but most of the time when I look there are only about 8 shows on at any one time, they are just spread across 36 chanels anyway.  When I look at what I pay in taxes, I am working 6+ months a year just to pay my taxes, I wonder why that is? Am I so much better off than I was 40 years ago? I can't see it!  I've worked two full time jobs, saved, drove old beaters, and given up a lot of things to try to make a good home for my family. The guy next door worked one job, drove old beaters sat on his deck on the weekend drinking beer. I get taxed at twice the rate, not twice as much, twice the rate he did because I chose to work harder to try to get ahead.  Finally after working 45 years and saving I managed to finally buy a retirement home 10 years ago. Taxes were $1600.00 a year but because I chose to work hard and fix it up and invest in it, my taxes have now gone up to $4000.00 a year and just because I own waterfront I get assessed an extra $1200.00/linear foot of shore line/year which means I now pay taxes on an extra $90,000.00. I still get exactly the same services as the guy across the road, the same services I got 10 years ago. Sure I have gained some equity but believe me that equity has been earned by sweat and tears, mine, now I have to pay a premium?  I'm 65, I should be able to retire but my pensions are only $1500.00 a month. I could bairly rent a 1 bedroom apartment and pay for food and necissaties on that so as near as I can tell I have no choice, live in poverty or work until I die.  Good system we have here when Counselors make $100,000.00+ a year and all kinds of perks. There is no accountability in government, lie, cheat, steal, I'll pay your legal bills into the millions of dollars and the whole thing will just get swept under the rug even if you are guilty.  Run hydro into the ground and get all kinds of bonuses then a golden hand shake and I get to pay for it. Pay to build the 407 out of my hard earned tax $ then sell it off to a private corp. so they can rape me some more!  There will be a revolution some day, God grant me the life and health to see it because as I see things right now our kids don't have much of a future the way things are going."
