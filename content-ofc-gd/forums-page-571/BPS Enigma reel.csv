549916,Fang,2011-02-10 17:19:00,1330,"Hey Geoff here's my two cents. While I don't know what the Enigma is like, about 6-7 years ago I bought a BPS Extreme as a patch reel when I needed something instantly for pitching and flippin but didn't have the cash for a higher end Shimano. Today I own 6 Extremes. RH's, LH's and recently a 200 size for frog fishing. I tend to abuse my stuff (ran the 200 in the downrigger for a couple of weeks in Temagami cause I forgot my other trolling outfit.  Do they perform the exact same as the +$250 reels _ no but pretty darn close. All I can say is I have 6 reels that can cover all my pitchin, flippin, casting, crankin and bottom bouncing needs. They've perfom flawlessly for me. I bought most when they went on sale for $69-79 and yes would buy another if needed tomorrow. I bought 1 Pro Qualifier on a pure impulse last eyar and spent more money but don't feel any differene to the Extreme."
549919,GBW,2011-02-10 17:28:00,8460,"Thanks Fang, I had an Extreme and sold it cause I didn't like it.  maybe I just got a bad one    but I would rather a $120 Shimano then another Extreme."
549934,solopaddler,2011-02-10 18:10:00,8605," I had no idea that reel existed, cool. It's so new there's not many reviews on it though."
549939,GBW,2011-02-10 18:21:00,8460,I found it in the catalog the other day and it just hit the website today or late yesterday.
549942,perchslayer666,2011-02-10 18:24:00,280," Yea, that's the 2011 Johnny Morris reel, their flagship reel for this year... Didn't see it yet in BPS, but I'm sure it'll be introduced in time for the Spring Fishing Sale.... I MUST HAVE IT....  Goddammitt all this talk about BPS baitcasters makes me want to burn a spinnerbait over and through some early summer weeds right now!!!!"
549944,ranksda58,2011-02-10 18:27:00,69,"i just saw that BPS Bass Caster online last night looks like a great reel, although a little out of my price range  whens the spring fishing sale this year?"
549945,GBW,2011-02-10 18:29:00,8460,"March 11 - 27 in Canada, US is Feb 25 - Mar 13"
549950,ranksda58,2011-02-10 18:38:00,69,"dang, i was planning on making the trip in a week or 2 it will be worth it to hold off though i bet"
555709,GBW,2011-02-26 20:37:00,8460,"sorry to bring this up again but I would like to know if anyone has held and or tested the new Bass Pro Shops® Johnny Morris® Carbon Black Bass Caster.  It looks like it is the replacement of the gold?  keep in mind, I just want this as a back up for myself or anyone in the boat to use so for $200 for a combo it's in the price range."
549201,GBW,2011-02-09 00:21:00,8460,"Just wondering if anyone has seen, held, toyed with, groped, or looked at this new baitcaster yet.  for the price it would make a good backup or maybe even a decent reel.  thoughts?"
549209,bassjnkie,2011-02-09 00:38:00,1101,"Looks like a nice reel, comes in 3 different ratios. I'll have check it out."
549210,Roy,2011-02-09 00:41:00,13728,Maybe it's a good one but I don't care for graphite framed reels. I'll let someone else try it.
549217,kickingfrog,2011-02-09 00:57:00,8333,"There are a few options at that price point, including a new reel from shimano. I would say a trip (or 3) to the store would be in order before spring.  Maybe wait until they have their ""spring"" sales and reel trade-in offers."
549222,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-09 01:02:00,4399,Pass! for a few bucks more you can get a Johnny Morris!
549251,ranksda58,2011-02-09 02:05:00,69,"I think at the sale price (79.99 according to the website) i would give it a try...doesnt seem too bad of a reel based on specs but like others have said, for a few bucks more theres some nicer options out there"
549275,GBW,2011-02-09 03:06:00,8460,"It caught my eye while I was in the study looking through the new catalog.  the reviews on the new Shimano at the $90 price point suck so this is why I asked.  I do not need one at all, just as a spare combo if I happen to blow up all others (6 or 7) in the boat..."
549277,Cudz,2011-02-09 03:07:00,2652,shimano caenan Sp?
549278,GBW,2011-02-09 03:08:00,8460,that's the one with the bad reviews.
549280,ranksda58,2011-02-09 03:13:00,69,"i was primarily looking at the shimano caenan, but like you, saw some mediocre (at best) reviews on it i then started looking at either the enigma or the pro qualifier by BPS, which had some good reviews...i usually dont make any decision until i see the reel in person though at the store"
549334,perchslayer666,2011-02-09 12:36:00,280,"They'll probably have a good deal on the Johnny Morris Elite Gold series, or the newer black version.... I would pick-up this reel over the enigma in a heartbeat... I have the JM Elite gold and silver baitcasters, and they have been incredible... Smooth, light, tough and can be used for many applications.  To compare, I had a Curado, and I sold it to buy a couple more of these...."
549357,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-09 14:23:00,3761,"Don't bother, there might be a few good reviews now but give it a season or two and something will break in the reel...just go for the proper reels like Revo's, Curado's, Energy's, and so on..."
549368,PainInTheBass,2011-02-09 14:48:00,102,"I am not a fan of graphite based reels, especially when, for a similar price, you can buy an aluminum framed reel with a proven track record.  At the regular price, I would take a PQ over an enigma or Caenan (plus, I do not like the knobs on the Caenan).  For a few bucks more, you can get a Citica, Revo S, JM etc.  Further, the dual centrifugal braking system seems like a gimmick, adding unnecessary weight to the spool."
549379,perchslayer666,2011-02-09 15:30:00,280," Doesn't the Curado have a plastic frame???? If you fished with a JM Elite baitcaster, you would have a different opinion....  Even if was super rich (which I'm not...yet) I would buy these reel because the look great and fish even better.  Seriously, pick one up next time you go to BPS and buy it. You don't like it, just return it."
549380,Roy,2011-02-09 15:38:00,13728, Curado has an aluminum frame.
549390,GBW,2011-02-09 16:05:00,8460,Thanks for all the replies folks.
549408,solopaddler,2011-02-09 17:54:00,8605,"    Have to say I agree completely. A while back the Johnny Morris Gold series reels were on sale for $117 and I bought two of them.  I think last year they were selling for $270?  Amazing reels for the money, definitely better than the Curado.  Has a couple nice extras as well: it comes in a zippered padded case with an extra handle and a neoprene reel cover.  Highly recommended."
549844,GBW,2011-02-10 15:27:00,8460,looks like I have to go check out the new Johnny Morris Signature Series Bass Caster if you are all saying it's better then my Curado...
549849,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-10 15:32:00,2690," I was seriously leaning towards picking up a Citica before bass season, but, might check out the Johnny Morris as well.  See what kind of deal they offer at their spring spectacular sale, Geoff."
549850,GBW,2011-02-10 15:34:00,8460,I'll have to wait till then Frank to save my change so the Mrs doesn't find out.
549854,solopaddler,2011-02-10 15:37:00,8605, Make sure you look at the gold series. There's a couple of different JM reels.
549857,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-10 15:41:00,2690,"  I hear you...I'm used to the ""how many rods/reels do you really need"" line, and she fishes!  I remember the sale that Mike's talking about...during the spring spectacular they usually offer the trade in an old reel program as well, might be able to pick it up for around the same price."
549860,GBW,2011-02-10 15:46:00,8460,"I was looking at the new one, one up from the gold one."
549901,solopaddler,2011-02-10 17:01:00,8605, What new one? Show me the link.
549906,GBW,2011-02-10 17:07:00,8460,here you go Reel
