We are still sorting out what we will auction off. We have some really good stuff. Ill have my laptop so Cash is good, but I should be able to take credit cards via PayPal as well.  The one thing I do have here is a box of stuff from Dave Mercer.    The autographed reel is one I think he used on his show, and its a Shimano Chronarch 50 mg.. Im not a baitcaster guy.. but I think its a really good reel!!!!"
