The truck makes a fine rod holder, tailgate fishing anyone...       The fishing was slow to say the least, I didn't even get a bite.  At least Moosy enjoyed a never ending game of fetch, here she is on the fly...     So far this winter, Buckhorn has been a bust. Chemong has been by far the more productive lake."

555001,Jer,2011-02-24 12:35:00,1426,"I guess she get's the retrieving instinct from both sides...Golden & Labrador.  My last dog, Bear, would do well to bring a ball back twice before finding something better to do.  This one never stops."
555017,mercman,2011-02-24 14:00:00,7054,"Hey Jer!! Mine is a Golden/Lab mix too  She is black like a Lab, and has the Long coat like a Golden.And she has a number 7 in white fur on her chest.  Smart animals....scarey smart"
555027,EC1,2011-02-24 14:14:00,930,"Nice pictures at least! Also looks like driving conditions on the lake right now are prime!  This is by far a long shot, but is this your dog from fall time last year? I got this shot in Port Perry and the guy told me his dog's name was Moose. I just remember the person told me Moose sleeps in the truck when he's working, and unintentionally bites a little when being pet.    If it was, nice to have met you then!"
555157,Jer,2011-02-24 20:28:00,1426,"  Scary smart is right. Moosy has a coat only slightly longer than a lab but not as long as a Golden. She is jet-black, which is interesting since her mother was the golden and her dad was a chocolate lab."
555159,Jer,2011-02-24 20:33:00,1426,"  Sorry, wasn't me or Moosy in Port Perry, though that dog is a dead-ringer for Moosy a few months ago (she's 10 months now). She used to nip a little as well but seems to have outgrown it.  Travel conditions on the ice are the best they have been all winter."
