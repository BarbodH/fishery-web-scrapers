You should get a facebook link thingy on the web site, people would just need to click on it to add it to their page. You could even start a 'Fishing for Tyler'  facebook page as well, couldn't hurt!"
543065,TJQ,2011-01-24 17:03:00,7806,"I had a chance to get a website running specifically for the Fishing for Tyler Event. I've donated my time, the domain name as well as hosting for as long as the event occurs. It contained as much info as I could quicky gather up, I borrowed some photos from past events.  This year I will be attending the event again and after the prizes are given out I will be doing a LIVE auction to Fundraise for the Frenches. I already have some stuff coming from Big Jim, Bass Pro, Dave Mercer, Pete Maina, Myself, Art, Spiel and Real Pro Fishing as well. (I've likely missed some people....)  I am really hoping to make this years event a HUGE success so I am calling on everyone to help me out. If you have anything for the prize table please email Elisa at [email protected].  If you have anything (over $100.00 in value) that you think would make a good Auction Item, please PM or email me.  Here's a link to the new site:      "

Going to move the hut this week to try and get on some fish as it's been slow were we are. Only 7 or so whitefish a few herring a bunch of perch and NO trout so far this year were it is. (87 FOW)  Hoping for a great turnout. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ALL.
