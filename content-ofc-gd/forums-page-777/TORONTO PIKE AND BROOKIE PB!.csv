390180,snag,2009-10-05 02:57:00,1932,"Hey All!!  Well, haven't been out as much as I would like but was happy when I could.  I realized that all the years of finding spots and doing the leg work pays off when you only have an hour or two to stop and fish.  I dedicate this thread to the combo stashed beside the spare tire with my ""go too"" lures in a fanny belt.  Many of the fish coming up were caught with this combo.  Yes, I have $300 rods and reels but, they are not always with me.  My baby with a dollarama spinner that is my go too (ain't gonna shed a tear if I lose it cuz it was .50 cent lure) lure. This combo was responsible for the biggest brookie I've caught and Fall pike this season.  The irony: The old #20 powerpro line that was $15 about 5yrs ago is worth more than the rod and reel combined. You definitely learn how to work with what you have!!    Here are some shots I missed posting awhile back:  Enjoying some time with Doug and Anton   Purchasing used line from a local hack   Met up with Clive (aka: Mepps) for a seedy looking lure purchase from the backs of our cars. I love serendipity. We ran into Bruce from Muskies Canada due to our open marketing. He told us about how they dropped (approx. 3000?) 6-12"" muskie at bronte years ago.  One month later I saw my first T.O. musky. Unfortunately, it was small, suspending and not interested in me at all I still can't figure out why they aren't around more  Here's Mepps and his art:     If I may, see them better here: Rockstar lures  Clives lures are in my ""go too kit"" You'll see why below!  Here's my biggest brookie. I won't guess the size. I'll leave that to the pros It went for the lure pictured with the rod on top. You’ll see the same spinner in a pike mouth below. No glory shot. Just wanted to get it back to safety.    Had some fun catching these in strange places! Again, using $ store lures while scouting unknown territory.....    Lots of these this year but not many pics. Nothing outstanding!  Here's one on a Rockstar spinner off the inflatable yak   Here's a little eye  and the FAT one   Here are some pike I had some time on/off the last week and a bit so I hit the old haunts for 1/2 hour to 2 hour attempts. The bite has been much better than last year!  Note: You won't see glory shots if I felt the fish was getting stressed. I usually attempt some water shots and leave the timer on when I’m performing surgery.  3"" Salmo - inhaled       8"" bulldawg - inhaled    Xrap clown    Dollarama spinner with telescopic rod      Firetiger hj14  Hungry?  Minutes later?!   Clives Corner Snotty on green Rockstar   This was a stalky, fighting mad pike. I'm guessing because it's messed up tail that the rest of it was just solid muscle 'cuz it fought hard!  Look out for those teeth!!    Spro (can't find these in Ontario anymore   )  Bloody hell. Didn’t realize it at the time     Poor shot   Random catchesfuzzzzy     Biggest (I've landed) this fall BIG firetiger countdown (magnum?)     Remember: Be nice   Relax   DON'T FEED THE GEESE! Seriously, I almost died. pic does no justice to actual size    and uhhhhhhh sorry tourney members, no signage on person  CIAO' BABIES!!  S.  "
390183,BillM,2009-10-05 03:03:00,17367,"I don't care where you fish, that's a BIG brookie!"
390187,PikeMolester,2009-10-05 03:09:00,428,holy smokes what the hell man...U guys in ontario have insane pike EVERYWHERE! Teach me howwww
390191,GBW,2009-10-05 03:19:00,8460,"DANG, nice report!"
390193,timmeh,2009-10-05 03:31:00,609,"Nice report, especially the brookie - that's a real beaut."
390201,Cudz,2009-10-05 03:48:00,2652,nice report.  Great fish. I fish this one dock and I bring a shovel with me to get rid of the elephant sized goose poo.  It is bigger than most dogs' poo.  We need to have a cull.
390203,Greencoachdog,2009-10-05 03:51:00,8163,"  Dude!!!... you finally posted a pic where I can clearly distinguish your face!!!  ... just an observation, you may want to cut back on the porn and alcohol... you look like crap!!!  "
390208,snag,2009-10-05 04:09:00,1932,"    Guys,  I knew I should've done a seperate brookie report!  Here's the scoop: 1. never tried for them till this years opener. 1 hour total on the way to my bro's 40th b-day party north 2. I caught the following brookies, one after another a short walk from my car; thought they were pretty    I was using a tiny panther martin that had a hard time casting with the pathetic combo I had.  So I went bigger and heavier to get more distance.  When that beastie hit I admit that I thought I must've caught a OOS bass or muskrat!  I am happy/regret that I did not hold it up for perspective.  However, I did pinch back the barbs after I caught the first tiny brookie.  and that is what I value most.  "
390209,snag,2009-10-05 04:12:00,1932, never  and I'm fabulous.   Flattery will get you everywhere
390210,snag,2009-10-05 04:15:00,1932," Tip: Pike fishing  Throw a lure light a smoke  FISH ON!!!   Just kidding,  My consulting fees are less than a lawyers.  c'mon down Canucker!!!!"
390211,snag,2009-10-05 04:16:00,1932," Agreed,  Cormorants first!!"
390233,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-05 11:40:00,3761,"Congrad's 20times!  wow you really know how to catch fish man, you deserve every catch!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
390267,BillM,2009-10-05 13:35:00,17367,"SNAG, good call on pinching the barbs.  Anytime I am fishing smaller streams for trout, the barbs are always pinched, regardless if the regs call for it or not.  Really reduces the damage to the fish."
390273,msp,2009-10-05 13:47:00,1336,Nice fish ya got there. looks like you really have the pike dialed in!
390319,BITEME,2009-10-05 16:17:00,1968,Nice outting gentlemen Me and Pointed had similar good fortune as well Pike were all ultra aggressive most swollowed the lures couple of 40 inch+ in the mix all healthy and colorful. stopped counting
390358,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-05 18:10:00,0,Great Report. Some impressive catches in DT Toronto.
390364,Leecher,2009-10-05 18:25:00,7832,Great report and pics Grant The leg work and the 1 or 2 hour outings sure paid off big time for ya!!! Got into some quality fish     Congrats on that beautiful speck   Some other big dude still swimming out there i see Again great job Grant and thanks for sharing Leechman
390376,snag,2009-10-05 18:59:00,1932," Sweet Pete, was that at the place I almost ruined a few years back?   Thanks Jacques.  Yeah, that one was hurting. He was meant to be someones meal!   Thanks again everyone.  This fall has definitely made up for last falls pathetic pike turn out."
390386,ehg,2009-10-05 19:16:00,2666,"Great multi-species report Grant Hard to believe all those species are caught within that bustling smoggy city.  Have been waiting for a report like this and Fidel's recently to get out there and give it a shot.  That one brookie is huge for southern ontario streams. Kudos!  Them walleyes and seeing a musky are a real surprise i would like to see personally one day.  I think that larger salmonoid looking fish is an Atlantic.....                    No, it is probably a brown trout.  Awesome report there Grant!"
390598,ccmtcanada,2009-10-06 12:24:00,7971,"You are the quintessential angler!!!  I am a better angler from your teachings....  I am a better person...  Wait...let's not get carried away here...LOL.  Great to see a report Grant!  That's one helluva brookie and an amazing walleye!!!  The pike...well, I'm used to seeing those from you."
390765,snag,2009-10-06 23:42:00,1932," Bugger! I was hoping it was an atlantic!!!!  (Drop me a line if you want some more info Erik)   Grantananda is pleased.  Angling divinity will be bestowed.  We will walk the path together  10% of your wages is all that I ask.  Om fishy, fishy Om"

390834,Moosebunk,2009-10-07 01:59:00,3970,"Always enjoy the reports Snag.  Terribly slow for me to get all the pics up with my new southern net service, but... did catch 'em all.  Great speck and eye and some classic pike fishing as always."
391083,snag,2009-10-07 21:12:00,1932," LOL,  I almost fell in! Can't believe you still had that! Stalker    I hate your posts.  Hope your computer dies and your rods break.  Then I won't feel so inadequate, small, worthless, desolate, and pathetic.  Otherwise, Thanks Bunk"
