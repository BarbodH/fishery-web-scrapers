Although I heard that was the case for most ppl who fished that lake last winter.  We are contemplating fishing another lake so we can have a better chance of catching some ""marble eyes"".  We are looking to stay the weekend (on or off the ice).  I posted a question a little while ago ""Nippissing or Temagami?"" and I'm still not sure what to do.  Does anybody have any recommendations?  Thank you in advance."
