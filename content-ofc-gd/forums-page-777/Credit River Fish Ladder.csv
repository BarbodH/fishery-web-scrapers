I was there many years ago as a kid and I remember what a fantastic sight it was seeing the salmon jump up the ladder.  I am hoping someone can give me some directions to this place, many thanks."

Kraft is now enforcing it now and anyone who is caught will be charged with tresspasing by the peel regional police. Your best bet is too take the kids to the bowmanville(goodyear) dam which is easily accessable.   Rich.

I suppose it is only accessible by the ministry or people of CRAA who run the ladder."
