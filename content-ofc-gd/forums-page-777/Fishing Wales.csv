391199,OhioFisherman,2009-10-08 04:23:00,6623,They charge you to fish in whales?
391202,dave524,2009-10-08 04:37:00,4508,"I see it's a lot cheaper if you don't fish migratory salmon and trout, almost 1/3 the price. Hope our MNR doesn't pick up on that.  Edit: that didn't come out right. Should have worded it  "" I see it is a lot more expensive if you fish migratory salmon and trout , almost 3X the price"""
391207,Fishnwire,2009-10-08 05:22:00,983,"Sometimes I think that licence fees should be higher and applicants should have to pass a test to prove basic knowledge of the regulations and maybe even the concept of conservation.  That's probably a bad idea...I have little confidence that the government would do it right.  It's just that the resource is so precious and yet we allow anyone with $20 to ""have at it""."
391231,cuzza,2009-10-08 12:33:00,467,"You'll have ticket fees on top of that to fish anywhere, you can't just walk up to a river and start fishing, that goes for the whole UK. You can see why I'm still like a kid in a candy shop with all the opportunities over here!!!!  Prices are the same for non-residents, there's no distinction - if you're only going for vactaion, get an 8 dayer or even dailys depending on how much fishing you're planning, you can get it all done online and they'll give you a reference number, not an actual license http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homea...hing/31497.aspx  Where abouts in Wales are you going?"
391237,BillM,2009-10-08 13:30:00,17367,Isn't a lot of the trout water over there owned by fishing clubs?
391240,irishfield,2009-10-08 13:33:00,26272,"Thanks cuzza... already been on there via ""fishing wales"" website...where I've printed out a few guides phone numbers etc so if it works into our schedule I can get out for some fly fishing.  I'll be staying in Talygarn (Cardiff for all intensive purposes). Hopefully not that far to have a guide pick me up and take me to the Wye river area or such.  Guess I'd better get packed... need to hit the road for the airport soon."
391241,BillM,2009-10-08 13:37:00,17367,Have fun Wayne!  Make sure to bring the camera.
391252,cuzza,2009-10-08 14:31:00,467,"Cool - have fun  If you have a car and don't fancy shelling out for guided salmon fishing, look up Shimano Felindre Fishery. About 45 minutes drive from Cardiff and has some big rainbows in it, most fisheries will be able to lend you some gear (I'd epect that a fishery owned by Shimano definitely will!!!) but worth calling first, unfortunately trout season is over on the rivers and browns in lakes have to go back, no close season on rainbows though!"
391257,irishfield,2009-10-08 14:54:00,26272,"THANKS!! Packed and almost ready to go... Not looking forward to the time it takes to cross the pond, but hope to enjoy some R&R with my brother for 10 days...and hopefully sneak in a fishing excursion as well."
391259,Roy,2009-10-08 15:02:00,13728,You guys have a great time! Pack one of those airstrip turkeys Wayne... they don't have Thanksgiving in Wales.
391261,irishfield,2009-10-08 15:10:00,26272,Yah I hear you Roy! Kids aren't too pleased with the timing thinking they could all come home for a good thanksgiving meal..... and we've heard that my brother and s-in-law go with the Welsh way as way.. and didn't prepare a thanksgiving meal when my Mother and sister were over there a few years back. Guess we'll find out... now can I take that Turkey as carry on or does it have to be stowed luggage??? Alive... or should it be dead??
391264,BillM,2009-10-08 15:22:00,17367,"Wayne, bring a live one and put it in one of those small cat cages"
391266,irishfield,2009-10-08 15:23:00,26272,If I was flying Air Canada I'd be tempted just to be sure I had a meal.....

391284,limeyangler,2009-10-08 17:49:00,5204,"Sea fishing is still free.....for now. I used to only sea fish because of this...you have the license fee, then all sorts of tickets, then pay the land owners.....whatever!  Great bass fishing all along the welsh coast( bass like stripers here)."
391285,irishfield,2009-10-08 17:52:00,26272,Thanks Limey... may have a look at that as well. Not sure what's on the agenda when we get there... make it up as we go along!  Now if Leah would just get her damn bag packed.... lol

391291,irishfield,2009-10-08 18:01:00,26272,Thanks Leechman... just one of those things I felt needed to be ticked off my list of things to do before I die.

391330,Terry,2009-10-08 20:54:00,14456,have great trip Wayne and take lots of pictures as I do live vicariously through your adventures...LOL
391989,irishfield,2009-10-11 17:06:00,26272,"Thanks guys! Other than the first days Jet lag.. having a great time. Think today has us now up to 7 pubs so far...so we're doing just fine!  Currently in England staying at my Brother's friend John's...that was his Herc navigator during the Gulf War, as my brother had flying assignments out of Glasgow, Scotland this weekend. We are off to Wales tomorrow.."
392082,Dutchy,2009-10-12 01:37:00,416," Some of it is. I was a member of a club in Scotland which had 5 lochs as ""their"" water. As a member you can fish it anytime in season, but they still give out daily permits for non-members, about 5-10 GBP per day. Salmon rivers are very expensive to fish, and without a ghilly (guide), you got little to no chance of catching anything. You might catch parrs from the previous years hatch, but the big fish are real hard to find and impossible to get to hit. Most people fly fish. I like the way the waters are controlled in Scotland. If you want to fish, cough up the dough, minimizes the ""casual"" angler mentality if you get my drift."
392124,swishmick,2009-10-12 04:52:00,8," Kind of like letting any foreign company with $20-billion ""have at"" our country's nickel and energy deposits."
