391923,Cudz,2009-10-11 03:54:00,2652,I actually did get a pass today.  My wife is a good woman.
391925,Greencoachdog,2009-10-11 04:22:00,8163,  I LOVE the excuses for not posting pics!!!   ... somebody shoot me if I'm wrong!!!
391932,Twocoda,2009-10-11 05:55:00,4130, lol...are you insinuating that fishermen might tend to bend the truth ...  my fishing camera is a sony and they have cards that are small like no other system..  .they come with thier own card adaptor so the card can be read in any generic card reader or laptop..  .(PITA) ....this little adapter was left in the wifes laptop when it went to school with the youngest kid and was to return home last night for thanksgiving weekend ....( he forgot it on his desk in north york but remebered to bring the laptop home)   He has been in school since late August but i only realized middle of Sept that the reader was in her laptop   ... the little adaptor thing is 120 bucks at our local wallymart and im not prepared to pay that price for a fishing camera that is on its way out of service..  .so my crosshairs are already set on a kid that is absent minded but im sure i can accomadate a double shooting if ya want ..
391934,Greencoachdog,2009-10-11 06:15:00,8163,"   ... yup! both of my camera's are Sony Cyber-Shots!!!... no excuse, 'puter and printer reads them all fine and well... with or without the adapter crap..... I guess a poor excuse is better than no excuse!  my guess is that maybe you should take pics anyway... that way you'll have something to share with the old ladies in the coffee clatch!!!"
391941,spinnerbaitking,2009-10-11 11:45:00,1622,"Do we have a mister perfect here or what, I got out with Splashhopper yesterday missed a lmbass caught a 12"" smbass & one 23"" pike gone fishing with my son & might post pictures when I get back Richard"
391944,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-11 12:25:00,2038,  Heres one that didn't get away ....   Yesterday morning 8:00 am on the '' Way '' up fishing...        
391946,Roy,2009-10-11 12:47:00,13728,Poor thing.
391997,Twocoda,2009-10-11 18:21:00,4130, My puter is almost a year old (obsolete already?)...it has slots for every card in the world EXCEPT Sony...i thought i was stupid for buying a sony camera but i see you are twice as smert as me   I did take the pics and they are on my camera...so if it porn ya want ....might i suggest you cmon over and see them on my camera and meet  the coffee club ( bring some of the southern shine with ya cuz im sure they will need it to tolerate ya ) or even better ...i hear Marge Simpson is on the cover of Playboy ( she might fullfill your need for porn)  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091010/od_nm/us_simpson_4   i went down to the river today but with the storm that went through last night ...it is a sespool of mud....went up to another river (tea stained water) but the wind was too hard to get a drift..
392209,CLofchik,2009-10-12 17:38:00,854," Blown as in dirty, though it should be cleaning up nicely by today.  There's plenty of pike around the Hammer, though they've been shunning me this season.  Massacred the whistletrout this summer though All the piers & points back in the bay will hold fish at different parts of year, though it takes a bit of footwork to figure out which when.  Which I didn't yesterday, fished all day all around harbour without so much as a sniff from anything.  Water has turned over so there's not even whistletrout to fall back on.  Too early for the browns to be showing up, salmon haven't made it to Bayfront yet, and the pike have just up & disappeared.  Aaaargh, brought the net, camera and the proper card (lol), should've known I wouldn't catch squat!"
392222,Greencoachdog,2009-10-12 18:05:00,8163,"  Seriously Twocoda, you can buy one of the little usb cables that plugs into your camera and a USB port on your puter... it's all I use!  http://www.buynshop.com/productinfo/1454/DC-CBSY-B/  They sell them at Wal-Mart in the electronics dept... very cheap!"

391840,[email protected],2009-10-10 18:11:00,290,"  Blown? lol.  We might make the trip up that way.  I haven't seen pike there.  Which part of the harbour?  The pier? or like, back the other way past the lift bridge bridge in that bay."

391870,BillM,2009-10-10 22:42:00,17367,What I caught today was not worth a camera shot    Although the few I lost probably were!!!!
391874,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-10 23:10:00,2038,  How the Heck did that happen....     Besides when the winds from the North ..don't go Forth ......
391878,Leecher,2009-10-10 23:26:00,7832, Broke the end of it just before leaving   :wallbash:  now it's a foot short Will be heading to the store where I bought it tomorrow morning and see if I can get another
391879,Greencoachdog,2009-10-10 23:27:00,8163," Dammit man!!! I hate when that happens!!  .. hate it worse tha a 'possum hates an axe handle!!!  Whenever I break a favorite rod, I have to disarm myself and throw my pocket knife into the water to keep from slitting my own throat!!!  The only thing you can do is write it of as a sacrifice to the fishing gods, and find solace in the fact that they may smile on you in the near future!    ... lemme guess!... the big one got away?!!!"
391882,Leecher,2009-10-10 23:44:00,7832," Oooohhhh I was so mad G     them graphite rods are great and light but somehow so brittle The good thing is, I have my receipt and if they (the Store) don't give me another.... I'll just buy a brand new one"

391898,yakpiker,2009-10-11 01:35:00,160,I fished an Orillia-area lake with a couple of buddies for several hours on Saturday.  We landed one small pike and this smallmouth bass which put on quite the top-water swimming display.  Caught it on a pumpkin senko rigged wacky style in 6 feet of water off the tip of an island.  It was a great day to be on the water with lots of colourful scenery and mostly sunny skies.  
391901,Twocoda,2009-10-11 01:41:00,4130,i went out for an hour ...brought the camera and caught one 10ish pound bow....no card reader for the camera to get the pics on to computer...
