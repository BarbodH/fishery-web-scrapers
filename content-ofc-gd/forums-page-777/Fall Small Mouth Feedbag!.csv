392046,Fishing 24/7,2009-10-12 00:07:00,709,Well Long story short.  Me and My cousin were fishing a QC lake and we had a heck of a day.  We start the day with a BEAUTY of a Football.    4.2 lbs  Then the couZZZ Hits a respectable pike.       WHile setting the hook he ripped his gills to shreds so this one was for the dinner table.  We drift towards a dead head and ryan (cousin) Hits the top of the log.  BANG!  2 lbs - ish small mouth gives out a great fight.    I hit the same log but this time the bottom part... in 15 FOW.  SLOW retreieve the spinnerbait . THUMP!  this smallmouth gave a spectacular jump.  Ryan nets the Bronzeback like a msater!      The scale reads 4.8 lbs  As we are doing the round of the lake Ryan spots what seems to be a sunken SHIP!.    We are wondering what kind of IDIOT would let his alum boat sink to the bottom and then ryan get the brilliant idea to BACK cast the boat .  SMASH! this bass was on a mission ... FEED FEED FEED!        at this point its pretty OBVIOUS that the bass are feeding for winter and that if i work hard enough The nickel WILL come out!  We are about to give up.  our fingers are frozen to the point of frost bite...  But my GUT is telling me to hit a Big rocky point.  I cast a MONSTER bolder With a 1 1/2 silver willowleaf spinnerbait. At this point i was hoppping for a big pike but what hit my lure was even better!    The weight    The FEEDBAG......      The trophy!

392077,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-12 01:29:00,2038,"When I was out yesterday , this four legged dude thought he would run out and block the road in front of us.....     Fishing was slow ..the wind was from the North 25 km's .....   We tried matching the Hatch ...    But the spinnerbaits were the '' in '' thing ..    Might have had something to do with a WATER SKIER flying by us over and over again..        Should have just left the boat on shore like this guy...      Musky season starts tomorrow..."
