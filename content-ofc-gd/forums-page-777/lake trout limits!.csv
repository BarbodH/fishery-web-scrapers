392453,Whopper,2009-10-13 11:45:00,2174, Awful broad statement  I guess you've never met the majority of us
392477,anders,2009-10-13 13:50:00,1168,"The only reason we here that americans get caught is because they have to go through the borders and get dinged there...most of the non-resident/amercians that i come across hunting and fishing up here are amazing...and feel actually privilaged to even be fishing up here.  I can tell you for certain that the most damage from the lakes and resources is due to the locals...thats why most people wont tell you where they were fishing, or they will just direct you to Wawa Lake!  And like the Doc adn Trouty (most are the same)...i know of a lot of natural lakes that will never see stocking and where the lakers meat are red like candy and just as good as the specks..."
392480,Dara,2009-10-13 14:01:00,3052,"Hey guys. I was not suggesting for a second that non-residents do not care for and respect our resources. I just put it out there for discussion that possibly a way to not limits our seasons or catch limits would be to eliminate non-resident fishing.  Anders, I agree with you, and the Doc and trouty...a lot of locals really rape the fishery. Limits every weekend, and more. But we live here, what else is there to do. Go live in southern ontario and all kinds of government money is spent for recreation. We gotta pay to go for a walk in LSPP. Very little stocking is done up this way. There is plenty more the MNR could do for fishing if they had a bit better budget. Cutting seasons and limits is the cheap way out.  I'm babbling, but I don't think that cutting into our recreation is the way to solve the problem in this neck of the woods."
392499,anders,2009-10-13 15:11:00,1168,"In the winter we dont have to pay to use the park...just the summer, however, i dont frequent it at all during the summer...as it is a tourist mecca...I wont elaborate much on this, but Maquan is getting crushed...not to digress...but im sure its residents...could be wrong...your right though dara up in this neck of the woods, there is not much to do, other than fish or hunt, but i dont really see the limits going down as a deterent..it shoudnt be...  If the mnr wants to reduce a limit, it should be the pacific salmon...but we all now that will never happen"
392517,troutologist,2009-10-13 15:51:00,951,"Man they really need to shut down Maq to fishing for a year or 2 or make it a no kill lake. I think that 1 over 40cm and 1 under just makes people keep those trophies.  Its amazing the pressure it gets on opener and closer. Not many lakes I've seen that produce consistent size like that once did.   On a side note. Nothing like a nice 5km walkon the snowshoes to weed out the crowds and resource abusers eh? Fish all winter and see a few other folks, maybe Roger will stop by for a heli-visit. No sleds, no litter sometimes a broken trail that goes to the right place!"
392550,anders,2009-10-13 17:16:00,1168," Truly is a remarkable place....next time they ""drop"" in i am either jumping in with them, or sending my gear for a ride"
392553,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 17:25:00,0," For sure!  The day he saw us all up there i had a lot of crap in my bag!  just hand him the bag and the auger and say ""can you guys just drop this off at the dodge parked on the highway?""...  i can't wait for opening day!  i have a date with lspp brookies jan 1st and some of those NATURAL fmz 10 lakers on the 3rd."
392555,Dara,2009-10-13 17:33:00,3052,  Not taking the new bride out for Newyears?
392561,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 17:45:00,0,  She knows new years day is opening day!
392578,Dara,2009-10-13 18:34:00,3052,  first reason of the year for marrying her eh  I bet she is lobbying with the MNR to make opening day Feb 15th...she is the one behind this laketrout thing
392275,pike slayer,2009-10-12 20:46:00,1177,"So there was alot of talks this summer about the lowering the limit of lake trout or changing the opening day for them and what not. It was suppose to take place jan.1st. are they actually going through with it? or will nobody know till the new fishing regs book comes out? When does the new book come out again? if they are lowering it i know myself i certainly wont be going for them as much. i'll be targeting walleye, pike, and whitefish more and only targetting lakers from the middle of feb till the middle of march cause that is when a lake here opens and i just slay lakers in there and the limit is already 2 in there with on live bait. anyone have any updated info?"
392280,pike slayer,2009-10-12 20:53:00,1177,i forgot to mention this is for zone 10
392288,swishmick,2009-10-12 21:13:00,8," If it's C&R, why does a change in limit change your targeting?  If they chop the spring out of the season, I don't think I'll ever target them; they are too elusive for my skills at any other time of the year, especially as I don't use a fishfinder or downrigger.  Does any one know if, back in the 1980's, in addition to the licence, you had to buy lake trout tags to fish for them?"
392295,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-12 21:32:00,0,"i hope they go through with it. i hope they consider changing possession limits for north of the sault... then i hope they'll change possession limits on brook trout... sleds, power augers, fish finders and vexilars, etc. make it too damn easy for people!"
392299,troutologist,2009-10-12 21:52:00,951,I agree the possession limit should decrease. My feeling is that they will do something with the season to reduce angling  based mortality in the winter.  Hope they don't cut off any time in the spring or fall though. That would change a few annual trips
392307,pike slayer,2009-10-12 22:14:00,1177,"i feel something should be done as well but i dont think lowering the limits is the right thing to do. i feel they should put a slot size on lake trout and possibly change when the season opens and ends for ice fishing. if they lower the limits on them ppl like myself wont target them as much and target other species more and that wont be good for the other species. i guess only time will tell as to what happens! i have no problem with keeping 3 2-3lb lake trout, any less and its just not worth going for anymore. but will hopefully keep buddies of mine shown here taking home a 21 and a 15lber home! mmmm mmmmm 50year old fat greasy lake trout! jerks_.php"
392347,Dara,2009-10-13 00:11:00,3052,why not just stop all non-resident fishing
392349,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 00:13:00,0,"while i don't mind the thought of less tourism, one must appreciate that MANY northern ontario towns are dependent upon resource based tourism revenues... quite a pickle!"
392357,pike slayer,2009-10-13 00:31:00,1177,"haha i like your thinking Dara! sorry gcd!! alot of non-resident anglers abuse our resources, im not saying al but theres a good number that give them a bad name. i tell you if an american asks me for directions, i'll guide them to a mud puddle."
392362,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 00:39:00,0," what, like, running over animals intentionally with a pickup?"
392364,Terry,2009-10-13 00:41:00,14456, oh boy
392366,troutologist,2009-10-13 00:44:00,951,"So Americans are the problem with lake trout numbers in zone #10? I'd be quite enamored to hear the reasoning behind this.  My experiences are that uneducated local people who feel it's their right to take what they want whenever.  Though its in your legal right (maybe not possession limits mind you...) to take a lake trout limit twice a weekend or every weekend the entire winter. It still doesn't mean this is right in my mind.  I don't begrudge anyone a fish lunch or dinner but watching the same groups do this on the same lakes every weekend seems like the harvest is not sustainable. Never understood why people want to freeze fish and not eat it the same day anyways, but thats a different story all together. Take no more than you need.  In LSPP I've run into US folks only a handful of time and they have always treated our resources as a privilege versus a right. No doubt both residents and visitors need to be reminded of what we have to enjoy in our backyards."
392367,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 00:47:00,0,well said. i don't thinks it's the yanks taking all our fish and littering the bush with tim horton's cups.
392369,pike slayer,2009-10-13 01:00:00,1177,"you know don't how bad i wanna tell you off right now dr.  but i can't, way to try and stir the pot. i try and be nice on here and i just get kicked while im down. i see lake trout as a prize fish not a garbage eating flying rat, i tried to put this behind me and jerks like you bring it back up. i'll make sure i get out lake trout fishing as much as i can this year and i'll make sure i take my limit and make sure my buddies get their limit to! to hell with it!! there was no need for that comment!"
392372,holdfast,2009-10-13 01:08:00,1813,"Not sure whats going on up there, but from what I know of the Algonquin Park perimeter Deep River areas, the problem was over harvesting Lake Trout in the Winter.  Seems they are easier to catch, but probably the real reason was easier to get to because of the Snowmobile.  Maybe a winter band is in order for a couple of seasons before the fishery continues to collapse."
392373,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 01:08:00,0," very intelligent. what were you saying about americans abusing our resources? because given the way you talk about making sure you take your limit, needlessly killing animals etc. i'd rather have americans in our bush than you."
392374,pike slayer,2009-10-13 01:12:00,1177,i'm doing it for you dr.! you really make a difference! i actually tried to care and i get shot down!
392394,rickster,2009-10-13 02:06:00,495," kinda like boats, downriggers and underwater cameras eh?   I wouldn't object to a decrease limits either.  One nice 3-4 pound trout is enough for me   alot of resident anglers abuse our resources too dangler  oh and if you want to know a good spot for lakers I can show you a nice puddle to fish in"
392399,pike slayer,2009-10-13 02:14:00,1177,"i know there are alot of locals that abuse it to, but i always seem to here stories about americans being caught and big time! like a month or so ago the americans caught with over 75 walleye in their coolers around wawa somewhere and theres countless stories like it and i see it all the time. and my rant with locals is natives bragging that they can keep as many fish as they want and can get away with it, even if they dont actually do it, just the thought bothers me. i personally keep my limit, its not worth getting caught."
392412,CLofchik,2009-10-13 02:57:00,854, You are aware that most greasers caught in Zone 10 & 15 through the ice are stockers right? Lake Manitou being the only lake in the area that has a superb native fishery serves as brood stock for a first rate stocking programme in Zone 10.
392414,troutologist,2009-10-13 03:03:00,951,"Thats a bit general for an area the size of 10.  Just like many lakes are stocked, there are many lakes that have solid natural reproduction. I (and the Dr.) fish many lakes that aren't or have never been stocked.  Lakers from inland lakes, having a greater proportion of their diet made up by aquatic inverts are definitely not greasers, as fine eating as specks."
392416,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 03:17:00,0,"  to suggest that a lake on manitoulin island is the ONLY superb lake trout lake in FMZ 10 is grossly inaccurate at best, and incredibly ignorant at worst!"
392424,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 03:54:00,0,"here's a fact sheet on the ""naturally subsisting"" lake trout lakes in fmz 10, and a little perspective on why the proposed regulation changes have been made.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/264855.pdf"
392428,CLofchik,2009-10-13 04:02:00,854," http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/264855.pdf  This the one you meant?  Your NetFoo is as weak as your argument, my flying airborne stocking stylee mocks your natural style in the last creel census!  It's not for nothing the area is home to the MNR's 2nd largest stocking programme, seeing as how they've even abandoned Haliburton stocking. I'm all for protecting lakes that are designated as naturally reproducing and preserving their strains, at the same time not curbing opportunities on lakes that are stocked."
