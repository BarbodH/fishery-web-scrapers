391686,troutologist,2009-10-10 00:14:00,951,Picked her up this afternoon in a blizzard.  Still waiting for the bowmount and HDS7. The dealer came through huge giving me some stuff to use in the meantime so I can get out this weekend after some greenbacks.  Here she is..Lund 17225 Pro Guide - 75 Merc 4 stroke.  Can't wait to get her out tomorrow.          The driveway looks a little better now!!

391745,troutologist,2009-10-10 04:16:00,951,"Thanks for the comments folks...its my first decent boat thats not a canoe.  Was hoping to take it out tomorrow morning but the 4"" of snow and 40kmph winds aren't making it easy."
391764,Spiel,2009-10-10 10:09:00,9065,I like !
391771,splashhopper,2009-10-10 11:52:00,2931,"ummm.... it doesn't look like a ""family member"" to me.....  and it doesn't look like it will do very well in THE SNOW EITHER  It does look like a nice BOAT though   I do have a question for you though:  If that is a ""family member"" what does the rest of ""the family"" look like?"
391775,Greencoachdog,2009-10-10 12:13:00,8163,Yeah! She's a family member!!!... and a real purdy one too!!!  I hope the other females in the family don't get too jealous of her!
391784,jaydub,2009-10-10 12:44:00,145," Wow, that sucks...guess they don't Winterpeg for nothin  Nice boat man!"
391877,TC1OZ,2009-10-10 23:25:00,987,Can I use it for the next couple of months? Since you will clearly be ice fishing!!! lol
391907,troutologist,2009-10-11 02:01:00,951,"No ice fishing just yet!  Made it out this afternoon after getting the boat all set up.   Problem free maiden voyage. Lost one greenback at the side of the boat because I was in such a rush to leave I left the net at home.  Got checked by the cutest 2 female CO's EVER then made it home for the tail end of the leafs debacle.  Out tomorrow morning, only freezing rain tomorrow, hardly poor weather at all."
391915,kennyman,2009-10-11 02:49:00,737,"That's a ""nasty"" looking beast. Everything looks better in black, NICE !!!"
391957,Cudz,2009-10-11 13:02:00,2652,"lol.  That doesn't happen everyday. nice boat!  My sister lives on Lake Manitoba or Winnipeg, can't remember which marsh. I used to go to a place (memory is failing me) with huge pike and nice eyes.  The name whiteshell rings a bell, but I don't kow if that was it.  I do remember that it was a river that had been widened I think.  Actually I don't have a clue what I am taklking about.  IT was only 15 years ago and I can't remember.  I will try and get the name of the area for you. Anyway it was like 2 hours from the Peg and the fishig was good."
