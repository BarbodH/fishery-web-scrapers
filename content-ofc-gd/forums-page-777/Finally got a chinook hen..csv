391401,Kinger,2009-10-09 00:37:00,351,"Took the long 3 minute drive to pull some spoons after seeing a ton of fish on the LSSU Fishcam. Got 2 nice chinooks, both girls!   One got to live, and sadly one had to die.  I am very happy to have some damn roe as I've been out for over 2 weeks and hate paying 4$ for a dozen, poorly-tied bags from the tackle shop. Here are some photos, not bad for about 45 minutes of fishing less than 5 minutes from home. Tight Lines, Kinger.    I hate killing fish, but I will eat her up over the winter and I really needed the roe.    Here is the unprepared roe, its curing right now.    "
391429,CLofchik,2009-10-09 01:46:00,854,"Heh, nice fish but nobody ""needs"" roe! I think far too many salmonid fishers get addicted to roe.       Hello group, I'm Clofchik and I've been roeless for 1762 days..."
391430,redneck666,2009-10-09 01:46:00,563,sure are some nice kings ya got there. maybe i should give 'er another go sometime soon... maybe tomorrow.

391434,Kinger,2009-10-09 02:08:00,351," Haha, that would drive me nuts! Its a great time and so close to home, indulge.  bigredneck, i was out in the tailrace of the power gen."
391435,[emailÂ protected],2009-10-09 02:08:00,290,We haven't got anything in Hamilton in about a week.  Nice fish though
391457,perchslayer666,2009-10-09 05:04:00,280,"""Addicted to Roe"" lol, its true, but the fall steelies and browns love it. I don't care how well artificials work, Salmon/Trout roe just drives them nuts...it will always be that way.  Besides it's the process of obtaining roe that makes it special."
391490,Dara,2009-10-09 12:40:00,3052, I'm gonna go try for eyes in front of there...I'll wave to you

391768,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-10 11:32:00,0,Gotta love having great fishing right on your doorstep! The thing I hate most about fishing is the long drives. Looking forward to your next report from the Sue.
391811,Twocoda,2009-10-10 15:12:00,4130,  i was roeless for just under 5 years...but i succumbed to pressure 3 years ago and cant seem to kick it. i use in moderation now meaning i no longer chum as i did in the pinnacle of my roeness abuse...but like all other addicts will probably agree...it isnt my fault ...i blame mother nature for not growing huge arse nightcrawlers on my lawn...
391909,redneck666,2009-10-11 02:15:00,563,"hey, haha thats the exact same cleo i lost down there after i got my atlantic."
392125,danc,2009-10-12 05:18:00,4677," Congrats girl. Nothing wrong with using roe, but for the record, I haven't used roe in over 3000 days. Get back to me when you catch up."
