No corners were cut to ensure the best possible product for the money.  This lure has a high polished finish to attract fish.  It's unique shape was designed for a flashey flutter as the lure falls.

391644,Roy,2009-10-09 22:40:00,13728,"You should do well with it although a few companies have been selling them for years...You're going to need a hook in your marketing approach.  I've tried several approaches and to date, the best response I've gotten was to a vegan bait I put out about 3-4 years ago....no advertising budget and I still get requests for it.    ps.  Sold bushels of'em!"
391645,Fisherpete,2009-10-09 22:41:00,1814,"Do you accept Canadian tire money? If so, I may just have enough to be an investor.  WAIT! I see a steel leader in some of those pics... I thought no leader required was a selling point... hmmm, never mind my investing. False advertising, tsk, tsk.  And by the way, the fact that it works is hilarious. I actually went and looked in my cutlery drawer just now. Do you start with tea spoons in the spring and move up to serving spoons in the fall to 'match the hatch'?"
