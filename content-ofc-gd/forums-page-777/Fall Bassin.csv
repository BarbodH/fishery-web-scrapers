391502,lhousesoccer,2009-10-09 13:58:00,442,"Outside of the spring catch-and-release season where I live, the fall is my favourite time once the water temps get down into the mid-50's.  The bass will crush any big moving fast.  Crankbaits and spinnerbaits - the fishing is fun this time of year.  And, the lakes are quite, and colours are on, most everyone else is off hunting.  What more could you ask!??!  Nice bass!"
