391887,misfish,2009-10-11 00:47:00,29133,I seen you on the news again cudz.LOL
391893,Cudz,2009-10-11 01:16:00,2652,Are you serious about that?  This is the second time you said that and I can't tell whether or not you are joking.
391903,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-11 01:44:00,2582,Gotta love the fall perching...we have been getting them in 8FOW since Sept 19 on Lady Simcoe. Yes I said 8 FOW. Going with Photoz for another round tomorrow
391906,misfish,2009-10-11 02:00:00,29133,No Im not.Of course I am. You were seen with two bass boats out just from the fountian area.Correct?
391921,Cudz,2009-10-11 03:35:00,2652,Yeah for about 20 minutes only.  So you do know what my boat looks like.
391956,Aaron Shirley,2009-10-11 12:57:00,655,"We found out the hard way Sibbald launch is down until Oct 15th I think?  The perch were on pretty good Sat, all on artificials, in 30' to 33'.  diving turns for smelt was the best spot.  We noted the fish were suspended from 15' to the bottom.  We got some herring as well, anybody else get these while perch fishing?  Aaron"
391958,Cudz,2009-10-11 13:07:00,2652,"No, got loads of perch, 1 sunfish, and 2 smallies.  Fished between 26 and 32'.  There were times when my finder screen was black with fish from about 15-30' in 30' of water. All my fish were on jigging spoons but my daughter caught loads on a worms."
391965,smally21,2009-10-11 14:21:00,993,i assume by here you mean the town docks???? how is the size of the average perchie there?
391967,Cudz,2009-10-11 14:34:00,2652,"Not too big. Just in front of fountain off wreck.  Lots of fish.  Mostly cookie cutter perch 9"" long.  several 10s a few 11s but only one 12.   I took 7 home for dinner."
