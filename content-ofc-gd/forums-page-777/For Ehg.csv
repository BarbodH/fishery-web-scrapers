386402,ehg,2009-09-24 00:08:00,2666, That by far is my favorite painting i have seen from you Thanks for posting it for our pleasure.  Could imagine the sound of water and wind as i casted that pool below the small falls for what surely would lurk there.  Thanks again.  Oh yeah haven't painted for 5 months or so but will. Fishing and painting will be lifetime passions. Cheers!

Funny thing about art---I've been at it for some years now---you can take 10 people and show them a body of  work and each person will have a different fav.  I like that as it gets evident that someone sees what you were going for  Bushart
