391894,muskeybugged,2009-10-11 01:18:00,282,Great shooting!  Nice mixed bag you got there!  I take it that 3rd picture is a PB?
391900,Terry,2009-10-11 01:39:00,14456,well they say a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush     looks like a fun day of fishing
391924,workwear,2009-10-11 04:14:00,592,wtg rob....always a fun day out with lloyd  i know which boat im following in november....lol....  cheers
391926,Greencoachdog,2009-10-11 04:29:00,8163,I guess if you can't find them yourself.. hiring a guide is the way to go!!!  That's what Roy does when he want's to post a report!!!... that's why he doesn't post the self-timer pics... he's afraid Marc will show up in the pics!!!
391951,Aaron Shirley,2009-10-11 12:52:00,655,Are seagulls in season? LOL   Must have been a handful in the boat.
391964,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-11 13:58:00,0,Great Report. Thats a nice sized sheephead. Must have put up a good scrap.
391980,darsky,2009-10-11 16:27:00,586,"  Yeah Glen but when we go out with a guide I come home after boating 75 smallies or 15 walleyes or 5 muskies. You on the other hand are good enough to go it solo and then report on your 10"" crappie or your 2 spots up to a pound or your half pound cat. I 'll stick to a guide once in a while to go home feeling like a man. And dontchya know only Marc's Summer afro show's up in the pics."
391986,irishfield,2009-10-11 16:57:00,26272,Not the bird they're talking about Terry !!!  HI from England lads!
391988,Terry,2009-10-11 17:02:00,14456,"gee.. you sound the same from over there    and I see they mean  a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush but if in that bush, a fair maiden should stand  then a push in the bush , could be worth 2 in the hand"
391990,irishfield,2009-10-11 17:07:00,26272,
391999,Mike the Pike,2009-10-11 18:34:00,3421,  Ah but our friend from down south does catch fish without guides here is the proof.  This was shot in Canada eh.No guide at all.
