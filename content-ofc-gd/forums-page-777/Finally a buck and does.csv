391817,misfish,2009-10-10 15:46:00,29133,"To sick still to sit in the stand this morning,but decided to go a trade up the card in the trail cam. Finally a pic of the small buck in the area. Nice and wide for a six I think.              Hopefully I can get out Sunday for a bit."
391818,Leecher,2009-10-10 15:58:00,7832,Nice cam shots Brian That six pointer would be a nice deer to get.... Hope you get better soon and go sit in your stand  They seemed to be intrigue by an odor.... I wonder what it could be Jacques
391819,Terry,2009-10-10 15:59:00,14456,looks  yummy  but their eyes make them look evil......hope you make it out
391821,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-10 16:28:00,0,"I think they're sayin,    'Yup, It's that Brian guy. I can smell him.' It's funny to see them posing for the cam...."
391825,Kingsalmon,2009-10-10 16:52:00,107,"I can't believe that they were not scared off by the flash, but instead came to see more of flash.  Weird.  I often thought that deer would be out of there by one flash, but I guess I'm wrong.  I'll bet that you would only get one picture of a big buck though.  They don't get that big by being stupid."
391827,Roy,2009-10-10 16:57:00,13728,"They won't leave, they're licking the screech off the tree trunk and ladder. They'll have lots of splainin' to do when they get home later."
391831,misfish,2009-10-10 17:03:00,29133," Thanks Jacques,  I have not put a scent at this stand since the 2nd.There are a couple of old stragley apple trees right there.The fallen ones are being eaten. Funny how there are no tynes?   Thanks bud.They are evil,thats why,,,,,,,,,,   Did you get a loaner yet Andy?   Like I said before,I had two does in the spring during the turkey hunt.The more I flashed,the more they would come in. As for a big buck,I just want to see him when Im in the stand."
391857,AzuluSpookd,2009-10-10 21:25:00,348,"Awesome pics Brian. I love viewing pics from trail cams. Too bad mine was stolen this past year, after only a couple of weeks out:(  If GB can get to me, he can borrow mine....for a hefty price:)  BTW, thanks for posing that question for me last week Brian."
391861,fishinguypat,2009-10-10 21:46:00,547,some people call trout bucks also
391866,misfish,2009-10-10 22:35:00,29133, Yes I knew that.Dont know why. They dont have antlers.
391869,Rustic-Fisher,2009-10-10 22:37:00,826,"Nice,  :D  RF"
391885,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-11 00:27:00,0,For the shoulders and neck ?.....  Thanks. I switched mine over for Carpin.... Sold my tail cam to Rhybak. Might have worked something out. I figured the first person it takes a picture of would walk away with it. It did have an internal lock with password.  They're cheaper now which is nice.
391888,misfish,2009-10-11 00:57:00,29133, Just get yer   up here.
391889,pigeonfisher,2009-10-11 01:03:00,696,Looks like you could rassle'em to the ground!  Ambush them and bring him down by the horns.  Nice pics.
391891,misfish,2009-10-11 01:12:00,29133," Steve ,I just may mis on the approuch, and get a antler up the Better to shout first,then ask question later.  Good to hear from ya bud."
391896,pigeonfisher,2009-10-11 01:34:00,696,"I forgot about the antler ""up there""...ouch."
391929,Skud,2009-10-11 04:46:00,739,I am still just getting pictures of Raccoons.
391969,richyb,2009-10-11 15:07:00,774,"Sweet pics. That buck sure liked the camera ! Figures, you get your camera working good and taking nice pics and now i cant even get mine to take a pic lol. I leave it out for a week and get 0 pics. Tracks right infront of it too so i know theres deer. It works good in my livingroom so maybe it was just damp or something."
