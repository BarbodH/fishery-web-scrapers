Now Amy has not fished very often, and tends to be afraid of them. Won't hold them or bait hooks, etc.....  The crappie weren't very co-operative but the sunfish were. Dozens and dozens of large slab sized pannies. The young lady was having a blast, she even started baiting her hook to keep the action going.  The smile says it all.   We wound up with a decent number of dinner volunteers from the wounded and too far gone."
