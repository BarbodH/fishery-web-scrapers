392052,Joey,2009-10-12 00:17:00,9122,"Got a chance to go fishing with an old friend today.  JP (Diplip) invited us in his boat for the day out on Georgian Bay.  We headed up first thing this morning to do some fall fishing.  The weather was pretty nice down here, but up there, it was a whole different ballgame.  It snowed on and off all day and the wind kept us from the Big Bay  The fall colours were fantastic.        We started off with high hopes, but knew the weather was probably not in our favour.  Here's JP and Paul all ready to roll.    One of the lines went and Paul was right there so he got the first and only fish of the day, this cute little pike      JP getting a laugh at the weather, or one of Paul's jokes    Here comes a doozie!    Good times in the snow (more like ice pellets).      The ride back was brutal.        Someone looking for a meal.    Even though the fish didn't cooperate, it was great to see JP again after quite a few years.  Had a chance to catch up and talk about old times.  Looking forward to seeing you again soon JP.  And thanks for the ride and great company, your JPS works great  :thumb:  Joey"

Well, I suppose warm weather and fish would have been better but you know what I mean!! LOL.  Great report...love the fall colours up there.  Glad the icy stuff stayed up there!  I'm not quite ready to deal with that quite yet."
