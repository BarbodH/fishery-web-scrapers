We did all that and it was only getting worse and we were planning on staying in a tent!! to heck with that! we took the tent down, packed our gear, and we were getting the heck out of there!! theres a pic when i was leaving the lake! the road out was insane! the road is barely one lane, more like a 4wheeler trail and from all the snow all the trees are hanging over and you cant see a darn thing let alone where your going!! we finally made it out which seemed like forever and down the highway we went! it was like whiteout conditions on the highway and was not nice, we headed back 55km to aubery trading post/lodge hoping to stay there the night then head out for birds the next morning, they had no extra rooms so we said to heck with that!! we headed back to the ranger lake road to head back to town, it was complete whiteout conditions on the ranger and it was a lonnnnnng drive home!! this is oct.10th what the heck!!!?? ohhhh and by the way my new good year terriortries are amazing off road, i put them through everything today!! pavement, gravel, water, rock, mud, leaves, and yes SNOW and bascially all mixed into one! i highly recommend these tires!!
