Sometimes its like shooting fish in a barrell (50-100 fish days) . Ice fishing lures tipped or just vert jig raps.  Burliegh is good, as is hurrican pt, if the winds cooporate.  Lastly, yellow triangle by elephant rock. With all that info I hope to get a report. They may not be there yet. Hope to hear back. T"
391773,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-10 12:12:00,0,fishing that deep for pickerel will only kill 50 to 100 fish a day..........
391833,Doctrt,2009-10-10 17:20:00,141,We bring our fish up very slowly and the all swim away stong.
391836,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-10 17:50:00,0,"Yup, they swim away right to the bottm......... and die. They only float a couple days later."

391865,Terry,2009-10-10 22:30:00,14456,"there are tons of studies that suggest that gbfisher is right and there is talk of stopping bass turneys in the fall when bass are real deep  here is a cut and paste from one study  Depth of Capture When fish are caught and retrieved quickly from deep water, injury may result from depressurization. Depressurization can result in over-inflation of the gas bladder, inability to submerge when released, gas embolisms, internal and/or external haemorrhaging and death. Freshwater fish have one of two basic types of swim bladders. Fish, such as carp, esocids, trout and salmon have a duct which connects the swim bladder to the alimentary canal. These fish can expel gas and make buoyancy adjustments more quickly than fish such as, bass, walleye, perch and most panfish which lack a connecting duct and rely on diffusion to deflate their swim bladder. Thus, while susceptibility to depressurization varies among fish species, it has the potential to be a significant source of mortality (Kerr, 2001).   To release fish that suffer from depressurization a technique known as ""fizzing"" has been developed to artificially deflate swim bladders by puncturing the swim bladder with a sharp instrument. In a review of ""fizzing"", Kerr (2001) suggested that the practice should be discouraged, as significant damage can result from the procedure, and that fishing deep waters (5-6 m) should be restricted if fish are intended to be released.  but if you want a good meal of walleye now is a good time to get them  well not me I can't catch them"
