391749,Stern Rules,2009-10-10 04:21:00,342,I did a search when I hit one a few weeks ago. There are some things to try to help get rid of it.  Just do a search and see what you can get. Here's some urls:  http://lavplourde.tripod.com/skunk/ http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Skunk-Smell-from-Animals http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf576594.tip.html http://www.ehow.com/how_117301_remove-skunk-odor.html http://www.bing.com/search?srch=105&FO...ing+skunk+smell  It took a good week and a half to go away in the car. Good luck

391800,Fang,2009-10-10 14:27:00,1330,"hydrogen peroxide will break down the skunk oil. Buy it at the drug store, i think it's 4% - don't use anything more concentrated as it will burn skin."
391809,AzuluSpookd,2009-10-10 15:00:00,348,"My Great Dane just got sprayed last week in my backyard and ran through the house, I was in the same boat as you.  Use 1 quart of peroxide and 1/4 cup baking soda, add in a little bit of dishsoap or dog shampoo, not much though. Make sure you keep it out of his eyes.  You've gotta do this relatively fast because that is oil that they've sprayed and you don't want it to soak in.  I washed my dog entirely in that solution, and rinsed him thouroughly and then rewashed him with dog shampoo and the smell was completely gone, unbelievable.  As for the house, open all your windows, front and back and let the air go through the house.  Mix a minimal amount of javex with water in a spray bottle and spray around the house.  Go to walmart and buy ""Odourout"", place one in each room and within a day, all your smell will be gone.  Hope this helps, just did it last week and it worked."

391822,stasbrute,2009-10-10 16:29:00,206,"I used what Azuluspooked used and it worked well, be careful around the eyes."
391823,CLofchik,2009-10-10 16:39:00,854,"Rent a carpet cleaner and wash the stinky carpet with a white vinegar solution, today.  Oddly enough one of the better things that soak up odours is coffee beans, in the really foul rooms spread a pound of cheap whole coffee beans on newspaper and in a day or two it will be gone if the source is cleaned up.  Works better than baking soda.  No, don't use them to make coffee after, no matter how cheap you are"
391828,craigdritchie,2009-10-10 16:58:00,1586,"Go to your vet and buy a tube of Skunk-Off.  It's a paste that comes in a tube sort of like a toothpaste tube. Follow the directions and the dog will smell good as new. No muss, no fuss.  Not so sure how it would work on the carpet tho."
391830,bigfish1965,2009-10-10 17:02:00,3382,have my ex come over and cook for you. You won't smell anything but that crap for quite awhile.

391875,TC1OZ,2009-10-10 23:17:00,987, I appreciate this comment!
391876,Governator,2009-10-10 23:22:00,879,I think my dog got in to something... she's thrown up 3 times tonight... sigh - gonna be a loooong night.
391936,Big Cliff,2009-10-11 10:08:00,6899,"Our dog got sprayed a couple of years ago. We tried almost everything mentioned above but if the dog got wet, the smell came back. A friend rexomended we try this.  NokOut  One application and that was the end of the smell. I was so impressed with it I decided to wash my hunting cloths in it. Next evening sitting in my tree stand, I had a coyoty come out 20 yards down wind of me, it had no idea that I was even in the area. Since then I use it frequently and ever since, I have never been winded by deer. It is 100% safe, won't hurt you or your dog and it ELIMINATES the odor. A lot of sport shops are carrying it and quite a few pet shops, contact them to find out who has it in your area."
391996,Governator,2009-10-11 18:02:00,879,"I know this is off topic, but as I  mentioned my dog was throwing up last night.  She continued to vomit in to the evening hours and then had blood coming from her butt.  This is her 3rd episode of this since 2007 (puking, bleeding, etc.).  I took her to emerg vet hospital and they gave me a $1500 estimate for 3 days of hospitilization.  She's only 5 years old, she's hypoallergenic, wheres a cone around her head half the time because of her allergies and has had these absolutely terrible episodes of puking and bleeding.  She takes a pill everyday, gets hardly no treats and the vet told me last night if I took her home she'd die from dehydration.  I'm at a real loss here, I love her so much but I'm so afraid she's having just a miserable life with all of her issues and she's only 5.  On top of that I have an 8 week old son who's now my #1 priority and I'm afraid of the decisions I'm going to have to make with her soon.  Has anyone had similar experiences with dogs like this?"
