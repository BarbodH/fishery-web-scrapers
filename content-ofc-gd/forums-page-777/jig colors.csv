391738,bassmaster4,2009-10-10 03:49:00,801,I was thinking about jigging for walleye this weekend and was wondering if there is a color of jigs that you find works best during this time of year? or does color not matter?  Thanks in Advance
391755,jediangler,2009-10-10 05:14:00,1923,I like white jig and grub combos year round with yellow a close second. Gotta match the hatch.

391770,Kinger,2009-10-10 11:38:00,351,"I like White/White, White and pink/White and also I've been doing good with chartreuse head and chartreuse with silver flake twin tails."
391803,OhioFisherman,2009-10-10 14:48:00,6623,"Bait fish are most species food supply this time of year, in a tube I go with white and silver fleck for a touch of flash. Grub, white and white head, in a bait like a sassy shad white or silver with a darker back and black jighead.  Fire tiger which kind of matches small perch can also work, perch are bait fish to any thing bigger."
391805,[emailÂ protected],2009-10-10 14:51:00,290,White/White all the way.
391808,mrdylan,2009-10-10 14:53:00,111,"I seem to have better luck with white jigs. I use the Gulp 3"" shad minnow and caught a nice 2 - 3 pound fish the other night and lost 2 around the same size due to not having a net on me. Should also mention i catch a lot and I mean a lot of smallmouth with this rig sometimes taking away from my pickerel fishing."
