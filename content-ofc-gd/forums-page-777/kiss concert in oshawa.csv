My daughter and I dressed up a bit for the show.What an amazing spectacle.We were on the floor in the second row centerstage right in front of Paul Stanley.Even though it was a smaller venue they do not hold back one bit,Explosions,confetti,blood,breathing fire,flaming guitars,wire acts were all included .SHWA ROCK CITY will never be the same again!

I have been a huge fan since '79, can't believe they are as big now as they were then. My son is 17, saw his first show in Hamilton when he was about 5, never thought my son would get to see KISS live!, much less when he was a teenager as I was. Maybe my grandchildren will be able to see them someday...............hope not!"
