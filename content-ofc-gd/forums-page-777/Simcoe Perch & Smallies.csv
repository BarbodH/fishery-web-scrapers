We didn't see or catch much.  It calmed down a bit over a couple hours, so we went to the break we wanted to originally fish, and there were boated all over it.  We went to the outside of the pack where a bunch of turns were diving for smelt, and it paid off.  Constant action with all sizes mixed in.  The majority of boats caught on eventually and moved over beside us to the diving birds.  There was no magic lure, they hit Mepps Little Wolf spoons, 2"" Storm swim jigs, Jigging Raps and a funky lead jig/spoon Tony had.  We got a bunch of herring as well, which was good to see.  The population of herring looks like it's getting healthy.  If you get one, release it right away, you cannot target them, as they are protected.  We found them typically in the deeper breaks on soft bottom 27' to 33' deep, from 15' down suspended to bottom.  Great time as always Tony.  Glad you could make it out.  This is what a herring looks like, they are different from whitefish.  They are typically smaller and have an upturned mouth, whitefish have a downturned mouth.        Disorderly perch, LOL         We wanted to try smallies for the first time on Simcoe, so we headed for shoals and rocky areas to do some searching for the remaining couple of hours, but we had a hard time catching or seeing anything.  Eventually Tony got a nice smallie just under 5lbs on a jig and FinS Fish.  Fluky stuff, he cast it out, put his rod in the holder, picked it up and fish on!  Tony's first good Simcoe smallie.. I have still yet to get one.   Good fishing!  Aaron"
