100455,007,2007-08-03 03:16:00,537,Hi folks.  Seeing as I seem to have been catching my fair share of small fish this year I thought there should be a thread to showcase the smallest fish that people have caught on rod n reel!  Shame on us all for forgetting the small fish in our quest for big fish.  Size isn't everything you know!  So what you waiting for post some of your smallest fish shots - you know the one - that small rock bass that went for that big lure or that tiny pike with a big appetite.  I can't be the only one to hook these small fish but I bet no one has caught smaller ones than me!LOL  Here's a few of mine from the last few years on this side of the pond!  Enjoy - and try not to laugh out loud.  Cheers 007              
100456,ccmtcanada,2007-08-03 03:21:00,7971,"Ok....during a competition with my 5 year old, she was up 3 fish to my 0.  I then pulled this monster in....it was to be the only fish I caught all day...at least I wasn't skunked....LOL  "
100457,jediangler,2007-08-03 03:22:00,1923,I love that tiny WGSF pic.   The twin perch were from Orangeville and the musky was from the Bog.
100464,Motorhead,2007-08-03 03:48:00,163,Here`s a small channel cat I caught in the Grand @ Cayuga....  Aug of last year  Doug    
100465,MJL,2007-08-03 03:52:00,2427,Minnow   Goby   Smallest mirror carp I've caught   Mini chinny (jack salmon)   Hammer-handle   Either a perch or a baby walleye...Not exactly sure.

100480,Victor,2007-08-03 06:09:00,1609,"007 you seem to be the ""king of small fish"" on OFC haha ... i thought my ""PB"" carp was small but i think it's about the same size as yours   other than that i'm no match for the other species ... love those colors on these cute little ones though"
100498,graftongal,2007-08-03 10:04:00,145,Let's see someone beat this one! This was caught on a Shallow Raider bait.  
100531,bowshep,2007-08-03 11:49:00,378,You win . Peace Ken
100551,007,2007-08-03 12:48:00,537,"Nice fish/shots.  Thanks Victor for the 'compliment' - not sure I like that ""King of Small fish"" tag - but you're right based on most of my fishing this year.  While it looks like I may have the record for consistently catching small fish of all species I just can't compete with that fish of Graftongal!!!!  Anyone got anymore memeorable small fish pics?"
100562,Joey,2007-08-03 13:18:00,9122," Well Snady, technically it wasn't caught, it was snagged  Joey"
100596,tbayboy,2007-08-03 14:09:00,1497,"Hmm well I can't quite compete but I've gotta a couple that are close:  Hungry 'eye: <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/65/175888436_d1d5401cdd.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Fishing 2006 084"" /></a>  Giant pumpkinseed:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/214443118_28320ad6ce.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0272"" /></a>"
100612,RobHall,2007-08-03 14:36:00,261,Here are 2 tiny fish.  Small Smallie    Small Perch    FOTB 
100679,graftongal,2007-08-03 17:10:00,145," Joey! SSSHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As they say in Tennesse, it's foul hooked! Still a catch in my books, lol!"
100682,Patches,2007-08-03 17:18:00,48, That looks like a logperch.
100684,Rizzo,2007-08-03 17:41:00,4754,"Don't wanna burst your bubble snady, but I actually had the same thing happen, except mine was about 1/4 the size of your brute.  I've got a photo too, but this is before the age of digital...and me too lazy to scan etc"
100696,graftongal,2007-08-03 18:06:00,145, Uh huh...    Sure Rizzo!
100697,ADC,2007-08-03 18:06:00,82,"   This was the smallest Pike I had ever seen, let alont caught! "
100700,caper,2007-08-03 18:10:00,210,Not that I haven't had my share of small ones but here's a recent one for my son..  
100796,joonmoon,2007-08-03 21:48:00,528,Okay here's a few from me and my better half...... a Pigeon Lake eye...   A Bronte Pier Gobie...   A Sturgeon Ski...   Here's a French River Pike who I think should qualify as a candidate because of the shortened tail...   A cigar from Lake Kashagawigamog...   A Waterford Pond Perch...   And this mini kitty from the Grand...doh how did that get in there...? 
100965,Bigworm,2007-08-04 14:17:00,119,"MJL, That fish that you think is a walleye or perch is neither, it's a Darter. I bet you caught it in a creek or river, they are prevalent in these types of waters. When I was younger, we caught them in Grindstone Creek. Very rough scales.  Mark"
