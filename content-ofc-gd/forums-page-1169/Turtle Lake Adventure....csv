I tried top water, carolina rigs and boat dock flipping and nothing worked. Finally I came across the huge boathouse and decided to toss the lizard in there and thank God I did. Here is the result. I went back to the spot three more time that weekend and lost 2 more big fish. That was the only spot on the lake where I had success. I found it very odd actually. Many of the locals were saying that the pike infestation has been devouring the largemouth population and the only ones that can survive are the larger ones. "
