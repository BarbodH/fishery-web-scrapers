Caught some nice bass and a walleye (will post pics shortly)..  On our way out to Couch I tried to trim the motor up on full tilt and it wouldn't go.. I'm running a 90 hp Yamaha... The trim/tilt works fine from the switch on the motor and from the switch on the bow, but from the shifter, it won't trim up at all..  It work trimming it down..  Any one have any idea of what is wrong before I have to spend some cash on fixing it..  Any advice will be greatly appreciated..  Tiz"
