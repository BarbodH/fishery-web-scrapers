100204,tbayboy,2007-08-02 14:09:00,1497,"Thanks for the details joco - I looked up the model from one of the pics (where I could see it) and realized it was a tandem that you modified.  Nice idea, certainly gives you lots of room.  I've always enjoyed the yak reports on this board and look forward to more of yours (I'd buy one but I'm waiting to figure out my next house move before purchasing a canoe/yak/boat)."
100222,glirw,2007-08-02 15:43:00,200,That is one seriously pimped out kayak ! I just hope that you never tip that thing coz that's alot of expensive gear to lose !  How do you transport such a large kayak to and from the lake ?
