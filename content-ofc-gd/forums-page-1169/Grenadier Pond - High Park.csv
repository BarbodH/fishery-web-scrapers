99692,Anatz,2007-08-01 01:48:00,74,"Today I decided to bus around Toronto and try out the places I anticipated for many weeks. I finally got to try out Eglinton Flats but it ended up as a big disappointment.  The water was so murky and there weren't a lot of spots to fish.  Anyways I hoped on the bus and made my way down to High Park and met some cool people and we pretty much caught a lot of pan fishes. I caught about 8 pan fishes and it was non stop biting! I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to bring out their sons/daughters or a friend who wants to fish for the first time.  Today was pretty good, oh yeah, I was fishing with my ice fishing rod so I couldn't cast far into the middle of the lake..just at the dock area only.  Next time, I'm going to bring my bigger rod and try for some pike and buckets.  Good old urban fishing"
99731,sharper,2007-08-01 04:10:00,279,Were you fishing from that wooden platform? I have seen lots of people catch sunfish there.
99737,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-01 05:07:00,1351,"i only fished there once, caught a 5inch bass and that was it.. lol good to know that there is some fish swimming around."
99772,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 11:46:00,7971,"Good job out there!  Taking the bus around isn't the most convenient thing to do, so I applaud you on your perseverence!  So you took your ice fishing gear on a 30+ Celsius day?? Get any strange looks?? LOL."
99777,Roy,2007-08-01 11:50:00,13728,"Way to go, Anatz. You're going to be a successful fisherman. Thanks for sharing your experience."
99824,gforce,2007-08-01 14:51:00,63,Congrats...  Been to the pond a few times with little luck.... only tossing spoons and crankbaits.  Still wondering where a good place to catch bass and pike are on the pond...
99969,motv8tr,2007-08-01 21:50:00,2587,Now that's what I call persaverance   I work for the TTC so I have an idea of how your day went....good on you for getting out there.  Maureen
100016,Clampet,2007-08-02 01:26:00,1947,"Anatz, did you see the pair of Double Crested Cormorants?  "
100050,Anatz,2007-08-02 02:38:00,74,yea i did why?
100071,danbo,2007-08-02 03:22:00,2646,"Try using small trout nymphs & white wet flies for the crappie,bluegills & perch with 4# fluorocarbon leader. Try small spinnerbaits for the Largemouth & pike. Especially early morn or dusk. The bay south of the big dock is good too. Worms on bottom catch mudcats up in the northern part of the pond."
100667,mcallister.grant,2007-08-03 16:27:00,327,"Hi there,  There are some big largies in there, but the spots are inaccessible. We used to go in there with a float tube and flippers but we were booted out by the Park Rangers. Early morn and evening work best. I admire your perseverance and pride for TTCing it and fishing with an ice rod. That's what I call hardcore!!!"
100813,oldphart,2007-08-03 22:38:00,665,"~~~I can remmber back in the 60s the city had a Bass tourney there, every year for a week, and one young lad won it one year with a 5.5lb. LM. There is still some big Bass in there, but you have to be there just before Sun up, and stay well back from shore, or creep up very quietly."
101011,Anatz,2007-08-04 19:35:00,74,Yea I am hardcore =]! I'm heading back there again =] this time I'm taking pictures and videos =]
