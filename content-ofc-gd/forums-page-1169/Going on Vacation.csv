I am going camping with my family in Northern Ontario at Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park near Mattawa ontario (2hrs from Lakair).  We have a site close to the water.The Tent Trailer is packed and ready to go.Bringing the 12 foot tinny I hope to have a nice report when I get back.  I borrowed Greencoachdog's fish finder just in case the fishing is tough  .    I will be back in one week with a full report.Sure gonna miss this website.Leaving Saturday am.  Mike the Pike.
