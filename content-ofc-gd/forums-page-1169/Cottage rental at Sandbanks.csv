I know west and east lakes are ok.. I think west is better.. what about Athol Bay? I hear there are brown trout stocked there too? If I'm targetting West Lake, what general areas should I zero in on?  Hope to post some results!  thanks  p.s. can anyone recommend a marina/bait shop in the area? I think Wellington has a reputable one, if I'm not mistaken.."
100911,kennyman,2007-08-04 03:46:00,737,I'll be watching this very closely. I'll be at Sandbanks soon as well. I could use any help you'd be willing to offer on fishing there as well.
100915,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-04 04:04:00,835,West lake is slow compared to earlier this year.  If the wind stays down you might try long point for smallies.  Some are doing well on the bay pulling eyes out of the weed beds.  Bait shop in Wellingtons good.  Glenora Marina  Make it roar  Rands mobile marine

100917,Mike the Pike,2007-08-04 04:20:00,3421,Hey PP don't overlook east lake the smallie fishing is excellent and you can find quite a few walleye in the outlet river and east lake.  Have a good vacation.When west lake gets choppy east lake will be calmer.  MTP
100927,ilario,2007-08-04 05:26:00,166,"  East lake eh? tried it 2 years ago for a couple of hours.. didn't catch a thing. Very shallow lake. Maybe I'll have to give it a try again.  As for salmon fishing, yes i am rigged for it, but it's my understanding that your have to travel pretty far out over there to get into them. Plus, that area can get pounded when the prevailing westerlies kick up, which is often i hear. As well, I think it peaks in early to mid-July and it tends to die down for salmon over there..  I will bring all my gear to max my options! plus, a stop at the wellington baitshop won't hurt..."
