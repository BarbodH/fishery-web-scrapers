100872,Crazyhook,2007-08-04 01:06:00,1154,LOL @ anyone swimming on a florida beach     The release... 
100874,sharper,2007-08-04 01:14:00,279,That is crazy!!! I don't know how they could catch a shark from shore.
100877,Daplumma,2007-08-04 01:16:00,1961,"Not sure that one will make it but may not be a bad thing.Sharks will shake their insides up so badly  when they fight that the die.They have no bones,only cartelidge so their guts move about easily.Landing one in the surf does not bode well for a big one like that.Beach may be a bit safer now..nice shark though. Joe"
100878,danw,2007-08-04 01:19:00,72,"Wow, nice PB.  Is that catch and release, or catching it with the pictures in backward sequence?"
100879,Crazyhook,2007-08-04 01:25:00,1154,"all catch and release, the sharks are out of the water for a small amount of time... then sent back out to harrass the surfers I have been down and done it with these guys and they really take care of the fish"
100880,Daplumma,2007-08-04 01:27:00,1961,Remind me not to surf where ever those guys fish! Joe
100883,Crazyhook,2007-08-04 01:32:00,1154,"I hear you... we went out to the same spot , same beach and threw out 2 half bonitas for bait ( weighed about 5 pounds), these surfers walked by and started swimming in front of us. I told the guy its not safe and he told me a few nice words so I wished him well 10 minutes later when my licker goes off they paddled back so fast it was a riot"
100885,danw,2007-08-04 01:32:00,72,These guys have a website...I stumbled it upon google.  http://www.shoreboundsharktourney.com/  gallery  Looks like an awesome sport.
100895,mikeymikey,2007-08-04 02:31:00,376,is it illegal to kill it ?
100898,mepps,2007-08-04 02:42:00,1301,awesome!
100908,Crazyhook,2007-08-04 03:33:00,1154,"you can keep it i f you want, most sharks are released now, especially the big ones. Small ones are ok to eat depending on the species"
