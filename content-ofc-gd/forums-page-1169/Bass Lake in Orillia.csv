I mean the name of the lake itself hopefully self describes the fish in the lake. It's a provincial park and fairly close to Orillia so I was wondering if there would any good fishing there?"

Lots of panfish and bass, look for humps on the north side of the lake with weeds.  Only fished it a couple of times but did well both times with spinnerbaits.  Mike"
