No special pick-up of carp this weekend   Local News - Thursday, August 02, 2007 Updated @ 8:21:23 AM  KAWARTHA LAKES - The City of Kawartha Lakes has announced that there will be no special curbside pick-up of carp this weekend although the dead fish are now appearing in Balsam Lake.  “Waste management staff toured the lake yesterday with the assistance of the city’s Emergency Service boat,” says Manager of Solid Waste Bill Pickard. “They observed approximately 100 dead carp on the lake. At this point, the numbers do not warrant a special weekend pick-up.”  The Ministry of Natural Resources, in a technical briefing held yesterday, confirmed that Balsam Lake was the latest to be hit with the carp die-off.  In the briefing, officials said that there was still no clear answer to why the carp are dying and the cause may never been known. Testing is still underway at the University of Guelph Fish Health Lab and also at the Department of Fisheries & Oceans lab in British Columbia.  First identified in Lake Scugog, dead carp have also been a problem in the Scugog River, Sturgeon Lake, Cameron Lake, Pigeon Lake, Buckhorn Lake and Chemong Lake. The latest reports of dead carp have been from Balsam Lake, Sandy Lake and Mitchell Lake.  Residents are reminded that they can still place the dead carp out for garbage pick-up on their regular collection day as long as it is double-bagged and does not exceed the 40 lb. weight restriction per bag. Carp carcasses will also continue to be received at all city landfill sites at no charge.  Waste collection during the week of August 6th will be on the holiday schedule meaning that waste will be picked-up the day after the regular collection day.  To report any NEW areas of carp die-offs please call the MNR reporting line at 1-866-929-0994. General calls can be forwarded to the Natural Resources Information Centre: 1-800-667-1940.  For those that might not know...Balsam Lake is the headwaters of the Kawarthas...water flows west to Simcoe and east to BOQ from Balsam..."

100526,lilkynan,2007-08-03 11:37:00,173,Why don't they take a load of these carp and drop them in where the Chinese carp are and see if this will kill all of them off before they go into the Great Lakes??
100577,danw,2007-08-03 13:39:00,72,"  In theory that is a good idea. It will only work if 100% of the carp die. If a 1% of the carp don't die and become resistant then you'll have a strain of ""super carp""."
