99849,ozaibak1,2007-08-01 17:06:00,401,nice fish caught there
99859,bassmaster4,2007-08-01 17:35:00,801,great fish looks like you had an awesome time
99868,fatherof3,2007-08-01 17:59:00,1769,congrats on some nice fish
99885,gforce,2007-08-01 18:45:00,63,Did you keep that muskie?
99951,chachi1984,2007-08-01 21:04:00,7,lower or upper??
100024,Clampet,2007-08-02 01:40:00,1947,I hear Musky are great sauteed in butter!! 
100267,drdanskin,2007-08-02 17:01:00,6,"yes we kept the musky. and now we have added 3 more large mouth, and another walleye at 28"". if we know how to clean blue gills, we would have around 100 lbs of fish. man do they like eating all my worms."
100350,gforce,2007-08-02 20:47:00,63,Do they taste like pike?
100362,Dutch,2007-08-02 21:18:00,831,Why keep a muskie?  They are not a good eating fish.  Keeping more bass would have been better.  Smallies in the 1-1.5 pound range are actually pretty good eating.  Muskie in the 14 pound range are not.  I bet you will say it tasted great....
100365,Sinker,2007-08-02 21:28:00,8692,  Have you eaten many? I've tried it and I think its not bad....if you like fish that is. I wouldn't keep one unless I had to though.......which is pretty much never....only because I prefer smaller fish for the table.  Nice job on the fish dtm....keep whatever is legal to keep......its your right!!!  Thanks for the report.  Sinker
100370,Dutch,2007-08-02 21:47:00,831," No, just one piece of a gill hooked fish that was a gonner....my opinion is that it tasted like a rotten boot.  My earlier post is based on opinion and not what is allowed by the regulations."
100504,mgilmour83,2007-08-03 10:31:00,8,mmmm rotten boot fish...sounds tasty heh
100505,Roy,2007-08-03 10:37:00,13728,"Great to see another of your reports, Dan. And, thank you for your honesty."
100509,mcallister.grant,2007-08-03 11:07:00,327,I have eaten musky on several occasions and the methosd that I was taught was to let the filets marinate in vinegar overnight to remove the muddy taste. I know it sound odd but if you don't the fish is rather tough to eat..
100825,fishindevil,2007-08-03 23:12:00,6254,"Nice catch guys !!!!!! and hey you ARE entitled to keep and eat those fish,so its cool with me....cheers"
100834,Joey,2007-08-03 23:19:00,9122,"That musky is about the average size of a good eating pike, so I don't see why it wouldn't taste any good.  We used to catch and eat them back in the day when they were plentiful where my family lived.  Tasted like pike to me.  Nice report and fish Dan.  Joey"
100836,linweir,2007-08-03 23:29:00,202,It must be Lower Buckhorn. It has good number of muskie.
