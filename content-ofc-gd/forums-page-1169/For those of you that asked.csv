100377,Big Cliff,2007-08-02 22:29:00,6899,"LOL, some interesting responses! The key to getting good results is to not take too much time to answer the questions, respond to them from instinct rather than trying to think them out. You'll get much more accurate results that way.  You can do several levels to improve your results in case you missed it. The more levels you do, the more accurate your results will be. If you do all the levels, then look at about the top 10 results and narrow it down from there.  Joey, I did an indepth research on you and your atributes. Beauty Queen was at the top of the list. I concur!!!!!!!!!!"
