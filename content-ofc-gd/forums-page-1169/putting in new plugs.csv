100806,ilario,2007-08-03 22:16:00,166,"Hi folks,  I bought new plugs today for an older 18HP evinrude (60's model). Should I clean out the cylinders before I put the new ones in? If so, with what?  The engine has been great, always starts, but I've trolled alot lately and I think it's carbing up. It wasn;t running atfull speed last time out and it didn't sound quite right... a little rough and hesitant. Someone in another post gave been instructions on de-carbing but I don't have the time nor the items to perform this as we are leaving for a cottage tomorrow AM. So, the fellow at the marine dealer advised me to use an Evinrude-Johnson product called ""Carburetor and Choke cleaner"". He said to spray it into the carb while motor is running. I don't exactly know where I should spray it after looking at my motor with the coweling off.  Any help would be appreciated!  thanks in advance"
100814,Big Cliff,2007-08-03 22:39:00,6899,Where is the cottage? Any chance you might be going through or around Lindsay?
100839,ilario,2007-08-03 23:33:00,166,I am going to the Sandbanks area...so Lindsay would sort of be on the way...dsort of.. but quite a ways off the highway  why do you ask?
100912,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-04 03:47:00,835,"It might have some kind of a plate in front of the carb that they use to quiet it down a bit, if it does you'll have to take that off."
100937,Big Cliff,2007-08-04 11:07:00,6899,"The reason I asked is that if you wanted to stop in here on your way, I'd be happy to help you with your motor, I have everything right here including the carb and choke cleaner however I suspect that if you make sure you have fresh gas in it and take it out for a good run you will find that it will work fine. If you want to drop by here, give me a call 705-328-0750."
100973,ilario,2007-08-04 15:15:00,166,"thanks a lot for the offer...very kind of you!  I think Lindsay would be a little out of the way..i got the new plugs, and I'll try soemsythetic oil too.. i also brought along the carb cleaner  well, off to Sandbanks... we're late!!"
