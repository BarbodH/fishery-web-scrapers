100565,Rich,2007-08-03 13:22:00,3927,"Well GB and I decided to hit up the mighty Area 51 to start our night last night. As the sun was setting, the bass were out in full force blasting baby bluegill like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately they weren't biting our baits quite so frequently. I did manage to score a couple of dinks on a rig that Newbie showed me a year or two ago. His ""bread and butter"" I believe he called it. Thanks for the tip Newbie!      After that we headed to GB's stomping grounds for some twilight thunderstorm carp action. As the heat lightning struck ominously in the sky in front of us, we enjoyed some great conversation while waiting for the bugle mouth salmon to show up. We missed a few fish, but things were pretty slow. I was beginning to lose hope when my rod fired, fish on! She wasn't a giant, but ""she'll do"".    Awesome fight on 6lb test ultra light gear!  After that it was a quick trip to Burger King then home to bed.  Thanks for the great night GB!"
