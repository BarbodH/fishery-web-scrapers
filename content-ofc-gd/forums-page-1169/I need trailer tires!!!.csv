100716,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 18:44:00,0,"Just got back from my camping trip and notice my trailer tires are destroyed. I have been really lucky they didn't bust!! ANyways I am asking around and no one has my size!!!  I have ST175/80D13. Load class B. Now I phoned a few places and they said I should go Radial. What does that mean? Is it a different size?  By the way, fishing report coming soon!"
100728,danbouck,2007-08-03 19:31:00,4380,Can't help ya with the size but this happened to me last weekend  
100730,misfish,2007-08-03 19:38:00,29133,"Princess auto has a big sale on now for 13"""
100735,SBCregal,2007-08-03 19:43:00,688,"Princess auto for sure. But be careful!!!! every time I walk in there for one thing, I leave with a truck full of stuff"
100741,misfish,2007-08-03 19:49:00,29133," Aint it the truth,it the mans of all mans store.LOL"
100743,SlowPoke,2007-08-03 19:52:00,2984,"Radial refers to the construction of the tire and they are available in the same sizes and load ratings as bias play. I just put two ""Triton's"" on my trailer, roughly the same size as yours for $160 installed inc. tax and nitrogen fill from Tirecraft. I'd recommend them. -Brian"
100745,misfish,2007-08-03 19:56:00,29133,"Brian, explain this nitro filled and the positives of it.We got nitrogen at work and if it,s good I,ll be filling up. Thanks"
100748,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 20:07:00,0,Thanks!. Isn't Princess Auto in Mississauga and when does the sale finish? How much is the Nitro extra?  Oh does anyone have the number???  Is it the one on Dixie???  Princess Auto limited?
100751,SlowPoke,2007-08-03 20:13:00,2984,"I'm no expert but I am long winded...  Air expands and contracts with heat. All tires leak air. It bleads through the rubber over time and a typical tire may leak 1 psi/ month. Air bleading through the rubber causes tire rot and can rust steel belts. Everytime you add air to a tire, you're adding moisture, perpetuating the problem.  Nitrogen is more stable at temperatures our tires incur eliminating expansion and contracting. Nitrogen, (and I don't know why) is said to blead through rubber slower. Nitrogen holds less moisture (maybe none) and reduces interior rot/rusting.  You shouldn't need to even check your tires more than twice a year unless you have a mechanical leak (valve) or a rim leak.  -Brian"
100756,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 20:18:00,0,They want 120 + tax each!!!Not installed and they dont even have anny in stock!
100759,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 20:23:00,0,They only sell rim and tire. Where did you get just the tires slow poke!!!!!
100764,misfish,2007-08-03 20:24:00,29133," Who,what,where ????????????? I just seen a whole crap load here in Barrie. That one on Dixie is a zoo.Been there.Nothing last long at that store.There is one out near Whitby.Try them Johnny."
100766,SlowPoke,2007-08-03 20:25:00,2984,"I ran into that at Princess Auto too. Call Tirecraft, they'll get what you need overnight if they don't have it in stock."
100773,SlowPoke,2007-08-03 20:37:00,2984," Tirecraft has ""flexible"" pricing... call one close to you and don't hesitate to check other Tirecraft dealers near you for the best deal. Don't be shy, ask them ""What is your availability and best price on (2) ST175/80D13 Triton trailer tires?"" They will know you're 'cost aware' and likely give you thier best price right off the bat. I'm guessing $64.99-$69.99 http://www.tirecraft.com/locations/ontario.asp -Brian"
100781,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 20:50:00,0,WoW! Thanks a million slow poke! I will see what I can come up with.  By the way Princess has tire and rim for $120 and CT has just tire for $99!!!  So far 1 tire craft down and no stock but I will keep pluggin away!!!
100785,SlowPoke,2007-08-03 20:53:00,2984,"Ooops, I just copy and pasted your tire size from the original thread. You want R13. R denotes radial ply construction."
100786,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 20:57:00,0,Thanks! Working on it now!!!
100797,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-03 21:52:00,0,"Best price I got is $93 a tire(Titan tires).Balanced, installed and everything. Im, gonna take it.  CT couldn't tell me if the $99.00 included balancing or not and couldn't tell me if the R13 fits the D13. (Same tire only R is Radial)And they are a tire company. Unbelievable...."
100799,misfish,2007-08-03 21:56:00,29133,"So did you ""get r done""yet.LOL"
