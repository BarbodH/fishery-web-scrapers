Tells you the direction, distance, lure colour, depth of water fish are being caught in, how far down to set your lure. Tells you when to launch After you launch and park your vehicle a person picks you up with a golf cart and takes you back to the launching area.  When you return from boating. There is a proper line up. You are waved in to the launching area. Someone picks you up in a golf cart and takes you to your vehicle. Friendly chat about your fishing day, of course I told all details to catching fish for the next guy."
