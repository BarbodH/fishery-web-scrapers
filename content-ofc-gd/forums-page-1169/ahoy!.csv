Got another musky while bass fishing. This time it hit a small bass tube. It was hooked just right in the corner of the mouth. Quite a surprise! I'll post a pic or two soon.  I'm marrying Snag's sister.  Cheers"

100301,Jay T,2007-08-02 18:29:00,282,"Hey Lucid, Fishing so far for myself not to bad. I haven't been able to do as much fishing as I would like, but I bought a house so I got a lot of stuff to do that comes first   but I have got most of it done so now it becomes time for me to fish once again   Hopefully soon be able to post some of my pics of the fish I have caught so far.  The BIG M word huh, Sorry man LOL. Just kidding congrats and all the best.  Here is a few Perch I got in spring in Eugenia. "
100305,douG,2007-08-02 18:38:00,2693,"Congratulations, Lucid.  I have to wonder about the wisdom of your other decision tho.  Why would anyone choose to spend Christmas and Easter and Hannukah for that matter with someone with a psyche as twisted as Snag's?  She must be a very special gal.  Congratulations again."
100306,glirw,2007-08-02 18:42:00,200,LOL DOUG  High five brotha.
