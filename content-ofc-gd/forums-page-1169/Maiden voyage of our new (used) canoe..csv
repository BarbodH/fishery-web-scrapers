99842,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 16:31:00,7971," I'm going to get better tie downs as well...I just used poly rope.  I managed to get it pretty tight and it didn't move around too much at all.  In the water, it was a bit tippy, but I've been looking online at some canoe stabilizers and saw you can actually make them pretty inexpensively.  The cheapest I saw online was around $200...for a few styrofoam blocks and a 1x3 piece of wood!  We may not use it to fish, but wanted it for when we took the kids out.  I'll let you know how the trolling motor works...."
99843,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 16:33:00,7971,"Wow Jason!!!  I cant believe it!  I know you said you dont use it, but it's still an amazing gesture.  Thank you very much!  Bly and I will use it for sure...and the kids both pretty excited about it too.  This community is amazing...no two ways about it....."
99844,Raf,2007-08-01 16:47:00,3495," the poly rope is just fine and in my opinion a better option since you always need rope, this way it can have a dual purpose.  straps, not so much. google/learn the trucker's hitch knot and you will be able to secure your canoe atop your vehicle as tight as you want quickly and easily.  a good test to see if it's tight enough; if you move the vehicle when you try to move the canoe atop the roof it's good and not going anywhere. i've car topped canoes many many times across long distances.  tie the rope to the two bumper support each front and rear of the car and for extra security, run a ratcheting strap across the middle of the canoe, through the vehicle (rear doors if 4 door).  to eliminate the strap from humming at speed, twist it."
99845,Bernie,2007-08-01 16:47:00,3190,"Oh Oh, I can see it now. You guys are seriously hooked. Couple years from now it will be a 20 footer and we will never get anymore reports. You will be too busy fishing to post. Congrats on the canoe and the generosity of Basskicker and Solopaddler."
99850,Jen,2007-08-01 17:10:00,833,"Congrats to both of you...

100066,Mike the Pike,2007-08-02 03:09:00,3421,Congrats to you both looking forward to more reports.Its a nice addition when you go camping it helps you get closer to the wildlife too.  Cliff pic up 2 rachet straps at CDN tire throw the straps over the canoe pass one strap threw the open front doors of your CRV tighten the straps on the inside next open the back doors and to the same through the back doors.Be sure to put a piece of sponge between any strap and the paint from your suv to prevent stratching and rub marks.Continue to tie the front and back with rope beleive me it will not move.Enjoy the new ride.  MTP

99795,Bly,2007-08-01 12:59:00,1556," Thanks Nancy!   I knew I was going to get it over the life jacket    Just so I do not look completely irresponsible.....  If we had tipped the canoe, the water was shallow enough that I would only need to stand up.  Thank you also for sharing your and Ken's canoe outing......I kept reminding myself all evening to keep one bum cheek firmly planted  lol    Sooner or later, I am sure we will cross paths"
99796,dustink,2007-08-01 13:12:00,526,Great report!!  What a great offer by a couple of OFC'ers!  I can't imagine the fishing reports you two will share now that you have vessel to get on the water.....your shore reports were enough to make most blush!!!  dk

99816,Beans,2007-08-01 14:33:00,3339,Congrats...Cliff and Carole...and good on you Jason and Solopaddler...  Last Thursday while checking out the carp situation over at Carp point (nadda) a couple came by in a trolling motor powered canoe...neat set-up they had...I couldn't see how the motor was attached but it was off to one side near the back and I was surprise at the speed it obtained...  Many happy days out on the water...  Btw...CPH and I were at the point yesterday and although we caught nuttin' we did see a couple of jumpers...encouraging sign...if it was the same one each time he is going to be well fed from the amount of corn we chummed with...
