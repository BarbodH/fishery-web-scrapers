He caught 1 small fish and that was it.We both had a few hits and saw a lot jumping. Of course they were out of my casting range.It was nice to get out regardless of not catching anything.We tried bait,lures,jigs so it was not from lack of trying.Anyway, here are a few pics to enjoy.No fish pics as they did not want to cooperate.Still trying to figure this pic thing out."
