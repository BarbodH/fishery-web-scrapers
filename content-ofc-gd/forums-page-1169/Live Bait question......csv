Now, Being very new to this I am just wondering how to keep them for the trip up. I figure they'll be okay in the cooler on ice until saturday when I go out fishing. I will be picking them up at about noon on friday. Will they be okay until then or not? I didn't use any live bait last time I went up besides worms. Also, on the way up last time I didn't really notice any bait shops on the way up either. I'll be travelling from hamilton up the 401 to 400, 11 and 60. Any shops I'm missing on the way up?  (I know pretty stupid question but I'm new!)"
100467,Motorhead,2007-08-03 03:57:00,163,Hi Arsenal.... I heading to Whitney this weekend and will be taking the same route as you..... I`ll be bringing my own worms and not really bothering with anything else but if I remember right Ellwood Epps  sells live bait???  maybe someone can clarify this???? I think it`s just past Orillia but I may be wrong??? There are a few places that advertise live bait on the way up but I can`t remember where they are exactly... Keep your eyes open and I `m sure you`ll hit a few on the stretch of highway between Barrie and Huntsville... I usually just use plastics... Good luck...  Doug
100468,MJL,2007-08-03 04:01:00,2427,They should be fine in a cooler with ice.  I've had them last for 3-4 days in a cooler with only an ice pack...They probably would've lasted longer if I didn't impale them with a hook.
100471,mgilmour83,2007-08-03 04:10:00,8,"Sounds great MJL, I'll grab some then.....Motorhead thanks for the reply, I guess I'll have to keep my eyes peeled on the highway. Also, since you're from Hamilton, do you know if Bill's on upper james sells leeches? Thanks guys"
100473,Stoty,2007-08-03 04:18:00,2910,"Not sure if they sell leeches or not, but you'll be passing Bass Pro Shops on the 400...."
100475,lickmyarmpit,2007-08-03 05:02:00,359,Ya man there fine in the cooler just treat them like worms dont leave them in the sun and keep them cool they'll be fine i had some survive all weekend a few weeks back.  The leeches and you fellas may all be screwed if its as HOT as it was today have a good trip.
100510,mcallister.grant,2007-08-03 11:15:00,327,"Hi Arsenal,  There is Bass Pro at hwy 400 & bass pro mills drive and there is a bait shop called Fish Ontario just past Canada's Wonderland in the truck stop with Wendy's, Tim Horton and gas station. I am very sure that they'll have leeches. As far as Bass Pro having leeches; I am quite sure that they do not. The have one of those vending machines and I think it only dispenses salted minnows, hard roe bags and worms. Try "" Fish Ontario""."
100760,Carpe Diem,2007-08-03 20:23:00,61,"Fishing World at 2411 Barton St. East, (near Centennial Parkway), has a Bait Shop that opens at 5:30 am. Don't know if they have leeches but they definitely have other live baits.  Here is the # (905)-573-1869"
100767,douG,2007-08-03 20:26:00,2693,"No live bait in Algonquin.  I understand that can be defined as 'no live baitfish'  in Algo, so woims is ok.  I really hope you check the regs first.   You can always call the MNR or Algo Outfitters, and I hope you do."
