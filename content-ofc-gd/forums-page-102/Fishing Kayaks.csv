994517,BillM,2017-02-16 19:49:00,17367,"I'd love a kayak, but I hate being 'inside' them.  I wanna stand up when I fish for the most part."

994526,Tom S,2017-02-16 20:13:00,362,"I've been thinking of getting some sort of personal watercraft again. I sold my pontoon a couple years ago for lack of use, I would rather sell it and have someone use it that watch it rot away in my basement.  Debating between a pontoon again and a kayak. Pontoon is nice and stable and sits you high in the water so you can see structure better, but takes more effort to paddle around in still water and takes time to set up. Yak is easier to paddle around in and you can be set up and fishing pretty quickly, but you sit low in the water and can't see what you're casting at so much. I realize that the fishing kayaks are a lot more stable and designed for standing, but that extra width comes at extra cost and weight. Plus I'm a klutz, so I know I'll end up in the drink every once and a while."
994529,Acountdeleted,2017-02-16 20:45:00,2562,My 12 foot nucanoe frontier is perfect for this. I stand up and let the trolling motor do the hard work. It's like having a 12 foot casting deck.

Low for paddlin' and high fer fishin' Jackson Kayaks and well as the Hobie PA's have them."

994580,Korber,2017-02-17 12:55:00,79,But how stable are those kayaks that you sit so high up on? I would worry that I would be in the lake as often as in the boat.
994592,BillM,2017-02-17 13:55:00,17367,"I need one of those frog boats with outriggers, lol."

You'd be surprised to be honest. Mine is by no means top of the line and myself and my buddy who is pushing 250 lbs both sit on the same side of it without it tipping over.

994606,Korber,2017-02-17 17:25:00,79,I got to admit this post peeked my interest in these and now I can say that I want one lol. That's all I need another toy.

994644,dave524,2017-02-17 22:30:00,4508,"They work all over.  Up in de North        That black 6500 has got a few years on it, got the mate to it. Mine dates back to the 70's, probably got a few tons of salmon to it's credit on Lake O. A spare spool loaded with heavy dacron and it doubled as a musky reel for a while."
