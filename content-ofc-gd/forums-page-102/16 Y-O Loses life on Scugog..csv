The driver of the machine will never be the same either.  Even if we legislate to try and prevent something like this so it doesn't ever happen again it most likely will happen regardless. I don't have an answer.
994641,woodenboater,2017-02-17 21:38:00,2277,"this is something that didn't need to happen imo.  the key is education and changing attitudes towards safety gear. a floater suit should be something worn on water crossings imo. and safety equipment, throw ropes etc..even an inflatable vest might have helped  (presuming they'll inflate in sub zero temperatures)  one key is preventing or slowing down the cold water shock the body experiences and that can be the deciding factor. gasps of air = water intake = drowning ( hypothermia if they don't drown) and floater suits *should help in this regard.  not dissimilar to paddling whitewater. a drysuit is an entirely different experience going into january rivers vs a wetsuit. that and paddling with a group that you trust your life with (and vice versa)."
