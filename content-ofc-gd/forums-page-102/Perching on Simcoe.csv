They said you must use course sea salt never plain table salt. Poor mans Lobster is what the Yanks that did it called it."
994697,Headhunter,2017-02-18 14:57:00,5703,"OI, I don't have table salt in the house. I use Kosher salt for everything, can't figure out why anyone would use iodine in their food. HH"

Four guys, eight lines down, five hours and only seven perch; none of them are to brag about. But what a great day as far as the weather goes.  Dan.  I find when you get these type of days the perch bite is usually short and early.  I was out early today fishing 27FOW on the west side. Put my first perch in the bucket at 6:40 and my last perch at 9:40. and never got another keeper so I came off the ice at 11. I don't know if they move or just shut down on days like today but I've seen it over and over and over.  A little sweaty  from walking in off the ice, so I had the AC on in the car for about half the drive home.. Can't say I've ever done that before in February."
994758,gaspumper,2017-02-19 02:45:00,393,"Floyd Hales? Bizarre, they used to be an excellent outfit. I actually had a Hales bomber run a couple of feet off of our portable shack on his way out and again on the way in 2 years ago. We where way off of his trail, and hundreds of yards from Hales huts fishing a waypoint from the open water season. He actually had to go well out of his way to take a run at us. It shocked me and I assumed it was a one off from a dummy employee. Maybe not. Correct me if I'm wrong but I dont think Floyd Hales is owned by him he sold out a long time ago to Ben vivereen or someone close to that name and I heard he sold to someone a couple of years ago.Right or wrong."
994973,DanD,2017-02-21 12:03:00,2223,"We stayed out until dark Saturday and back out Sunday a day break. We headed for home around noon with a count of 45 perch, all 10 inches or above. There were a lot of small guys being caught and the bite was very light; it was like fishing pickerel. Got home and emptied the truck of the essentials and left the rest to clean up on Monday; being it was a holiday. Monday morning my wife says to me where's the truck, in the driveway I answered; she says no its not! Sure enough somebody stole the truck and everything in it; snowmobile, portable 1500 watt generator, tool box filled to the rim, all my cold weather gear and the spare tire for the fish hut. So now I sit and wait for the cops to hopefully find my truck and the rest of the stuff; like that's going to happen. If they do find the truck, I hope the thieves have written it off. I've done a lot of theft recovery repairs and the vehicles are never the same after the beating they get. 2005 Chevy Avalanche (burnt orange), 1998 Ski-doo Touring 500 (green), 1500 watt Champion generator (yellow) less then one year old. The rest of the stuff was clothing and stuff that you would normally collect in a vehicle with 180K on it.  Dan"

994995,Sinker,2017-02-21 14:19:00,8692,"Nice to meet you Dan. I still think that hut is the cats meow. You had bad conditions the day I saw you out there for towing anything. Wet, sticky snow sucks. A set of skies the width of your ladders would make a big difference. I have access to all sorts of that nylon you have for runners, and I can get it the full width of your ladders....or full 4x8 sheets if you need it. I think it would make a big difference.  Crazy about your truck and gear. That REALLY sucks!!! Is the hut still out there? If you need a hand with anything, I plan to be out there this coming saturday, so just let me know if I can help at all.  S."

If you need a hand with anything, I plan to be out there this coming saturday, so just let me know if I can help at all.  S.  I did try with the skies on but couldn't get enough speed up to keep the skies on top the snow; so they just plowed there way through. My sled wasn't large enough to pull in those conditions; I gave up after I all but smoked the sleds drive belt. I also have the equivalent of puck board, riveted to the runners of the latter skies; but there was/is to much drag from them being so wide. Going to change the design of the skies and make them more like tall skates. I'm hoping that the skates will be tall enough, to keep the hut above the snow and the skate to cut through the snow, down to the ice; like a large smitty sled? The hut is back on shore now; a friend of Justin (Guy from bait shack) has a buddy with a 4X4 tracked side by side and it pulled it pretty good It was too sloppy Sunday to pull the hut in; but Brian (4X4 Guy) was able to drag it in, early Monday morning; before the snow started its melt.  Still waiting for the insurance company to authorize a rental truck; once I have that, I'll make a run up there and collect the hut.  Thanks for the offer of help Sinker; but I should be OK, as long as the paper pushers get their act together?  Dan."
995054,Big Cliff,2017-02-21 21:44:00,6899,"If you need a truck to haul the hut back just let me know, I can borrow one from work, (I drive for Marbert Transport here in Lindsay and we have a few pickups in our fleet).  Anything I can do to help, just ask!"
995075,Sinker,2017-02-21 23:22:00,8692,"I looked at your skis. I think if the puck board was the width of the ladders it would work better.  For example, this weekend a buddy got his 16ft enclosed trailer and 1 ton dodge stuck. We unhooked the trailer and slid a 4"" wide x 8ft strip of puck board under the trailer jack and turned it around by hand. It slid like butter.  The trick is to stay on top, not cut through snow. If your puckboard was as wide as the full width of the ladder i bet you could move it by hand.  S."
995122,DanD,2017-02-22 11:24:00,2223,"Thanks Cliff and Sinker for the offer and advice. The insurance and Enterprise came through late yesterday afternoon. They gave me a 2017 Navigator to use, until my claim gets settled; that gas guzzling turd should be able to bring my hut home? Your puck board theory sounds interesting Sinker. I have to build an new set anyway; thieves got my old ones as well.  Dan."
994496,DanD,2017-02-16 15:32:00,2223,"Just back from a few days on Lake Simcoe. The fishing was decent; not crazy one after another but steady. Three days fishing and I lost count of the perch brought in, along with a number of herring in the mix. I did keep a limit of perch, which gave me 11lbs of fillets; so they were all a good size.   It was also an educational weekend for me and my trailer/hut building project. The way I built the trailer, too be strong enough to handle the roads, is just too heavy to pull through wet, heavy snow; at least it is for my 500 Ski doo. Only made it 2Klm out and all but smoked the belt on the machine.  Couldn't do anything about it, so we set up there in 16 feet of water. The day wasn't a complete loss, we caught a few fish and I got to meet Sinker and his wife, when they stopped at the hut; on their way back to shore.  ( Sinker. It was bad fuel that caused the running issue with my sled. Drained and refilled with fresh and that misfire disappeared )  The next morning I made arrangements with a guy too pull the hut out to the perch grounds.  A big thank you to Justin at the bait shack and Brian with his side by side tracked machine. We set up a few hundred yards off of Tim Hale's tree line, close to a pack of other huts; in 30 some odd feet of water. Going back up Saturday, get a few more hours in fishing and then hopefully get Brain to drag the hut back in for me.  Side note. I will never set foot into the hut operator's trailer or ever spend a dime at his operation; that is at the access point in Beaverton. Arrogant A hole!!! I went in with a hundred dollar bill in my hand, to ask if I could hire him to haul the hut out for me. this is the owner's response ""I'm not hooking my equipment to someone else's F%#&ing junk"" OK a simple NO would have sufficed????  Dan."
994500,ketchenany,2017-02-16 17:10:00,3229,Just wish HIS car breaks in front of your shop someday! You will show him some   too.
994501,Terry,2017-02-16 17:13:00,14456,That is too bad about the operator I had a dealing with one from Beaverton too News reports and police and others always said Ask the Hut operators about ice conditions before you venture out So I did.  The guy said to me if you don't know the conditions rent a hut or take your chances. He was there to run a business not give out free info.  Anyway.  11 lbs of perch sounds good  to me.
994505,Headhunter,2017-02-16 17:40:00,5703,"Why does it seem that the majority of outfitters seem to be in the ""Richard"" camp? Such short shortsightedness can't be good for business, short or long term. HH"

Wouldn't want someones else's junk damaging his equipment. LOL  After going through all the crap of getting the hut out on the ice; I had a great time. Hearing my 70 year old brother in-law, hollering ""tip-up"" and running like a teenager for his line; it was like being kids again. Monday & Tuesday, I was out there by myself and I couldn't believe how fast the time went; it had to be one of the most relaxing times I have ever had.  Dan."

Not good to hear about Hales, many here recently raved about them. Maybe a bad day to ask for help. Everyone thinks that if you own a business you are making great money.

I have used Floyd Hales many times in the past (been quite a few years). And they where always top notch.  The incident I described was with a Floyd  Hales bomber.  And as I mentioned, I assumed it was a one off with an employee with a bad attitude.  Given Dans experience with the same outfit, maybe it wasn't.  I still couldn't dump all over them without more info, but no doubt Dans incident is as described."

994616,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-17 18:32:00,8243,"Stop it right now with all this talk of eating perch, stop please.  To spice them up a bit I mix Montreal Steak Spice in with the breadcrumbs. To deep fry anything really crispy always dry/wet/dry. Dredge in flour first then wet mixture then crumbs. Kellogg Corn Flakes make a great breading too, Ritz Cheeze crackers are great. There are all kinds of breadings other than bread crumbs that work great. Just this morning I saw on TV where they were trying to duplicate the KFC secret recipe that KFC uses egg whites only as their wet dip before going into the secret dry mix. You can make Italian breadcrumbs simply by adding a bit of dried oregano, basil and garlic powder, basically what I do by adding Mont. Steak Spice, it and more is all in there, be careful with salt as MSS has plenty in it already, I don't salt anything when I use steak spice in the dish until I taste test.To really spice it up add Parmesan cheese to any crumbs too.  Now no more talking about Perch scarfs unless it includes an invitation to us all."
