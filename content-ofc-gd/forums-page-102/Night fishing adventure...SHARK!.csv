994762,GBW,2017-02-19 03:07:00,8460,"I finally got around to watching that and well, that's one walk I sure wouldn't do solo at night.  Too bad you didn't find more (or plan to) crab's and get a meal out of them too   Next time..."
994771,spincast,2017-02-19 13:31:00,3279,"wicked - love the last half where you're fishing with the ""short"" rod. I'd have had to do a little more editing at the point where it snapped than you had to . At least it wasn't the St Croix."
