Haven't fished the lake in 20 years, remember catching a few pickerel. Imagine there are crappie and perch too?  How's the ice right now?"
994364,captpierre,2017-02-15 00:02:00,2521,Just panfish open in the winter on Pigeon.
994366,tilly,2017-02-15 00:33:00,32,"Thanks for the reminder, just checked the regs. That changes everything....Gotta chase crappie I guess, many perch in there?"
994376,captpierre,2017-02-15 01:21:00,2521,Perch numbers are low. Mostly bluegills and Rockies. Some guys can find crappies.
994378,Tjames09,2017-02-15 01:24:00,664,All of the kawarthas are pan fish only. And pike if the lake has it.
994400,Korber,2017-02-15 13:45:00,79,Nice weekend coming up I might head up for some blue's. Worried the ice might not be good though

Worried the ice might not be good though  I havent been to Pigeon so I cant confirm its thickness but I have been to Simcoe which is a much larger body of water and Ive been out to 30FOW and its over 12"" thick everywhere Ive been."
