Overwork it, get it hot a few times and you're asking for it. Subaru has a strong little motor that can take a bit of a beating; but you can beat anything to death if you wanted too.  Dan.  Subarus are plagued by it though, most owners consider doing HGs every 100k a normal thing.  Unless things have changed, but every EJ series engine found in those cars suffers from it.  It's too bad because their AWD system is fantastic."

I dont have many details about it on hand, but can get them if you're interested - drop me a PM. I do know that it's in really great shape and my father in law is super meticulous about anything he owns. if i didn't already lease a new vehicle in Dec I would have snapped this up in a heart beat."

994623,captpierre,2017-02-17 19:16:00,2521,"Time to get the wifey a new car. Doesn't drive much. 5-10k km/yr. Want  a reliable AWD taller vehicle that's easier to get in and out of. Not too big. Toyota dealer has a RAV4 2013, 63K km. I'm a good negotiator. Best price is $22K. $30k new. Only 1 used RAV4 on lot.  They have a hard time keeping them in stock. Their best selling vehicle- New and used. Found out lots of used cars shipped to US thanks to the dollar. They are scarce here. That's crazy for a 4 yr old small SUV. Test drove a new Subaru Crosstrek. Seems good and well rated. They say best AWD system. Can get new base model with heated seats (a must for Boss) for $26.5k. For $4.5k a new car over the Rav4. Anybody have any knowledge on them? Thanks Peter"
994625,DanD,2017-02-17 19:31:00,2223,"Don't know about the Crosstrek (To new for me and my shop); but if Subaru hasn't dropped the ball on this model, its likely a good vehicle? I work on a lot of the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) vehicles and they have a fleet of Outbacks. These things have been all but bullet proof; with the regular maintenance; clean oil and a timing belts at the proper intervals. Other customers that have Subaru's are running an easy 500K Klms on these things and not a hint of engine issues. Yes they like their brakes and some of the steering component; but what vehicle doesn't?  Dan."

994728,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-18 22:35:00,8243,"I haven't even used a broom here to sweep snow off the steps this winter. That's because both vehicles were outfitted with new snow tires this past fall.  I have never owned "" all wheel drive"". Is it that much better than front wheel drive? The Silverado is a 4X4 and without it 3 winters ago we would be house bound many times until we could get our private laneway plowed out. When snow is deep road clearance is a determining factor, I have had to pull out my neighbour that has all wheel drive more than a few times to the county road when the snow was above his front under carriage on our laneway.  I have plowed through snow in 4 low that was well above the bottom of the doors, no way that is happening in all wheel drive. I guess what I'm saying is if you don't want to get stuck get a real deal 4X4."

994763,Rattletrap2,2017-02-19 03:13:00,1652,"I can tell you this........ we have a 2004 FWD Pontiac Vibe (Toyota Matrix) with snow tires and it has been stuck in the driveway twice this year. I also have a 2003 Toyota Rav4 also with snow tires and so far, it goes through anything. We live in a snow belt and any amount of wheels driving with good tires won't help you if the car is bottomed out on snow! What you need is ground clearance as well and the Rav4 certainly beats the FWD in that department.. My next vehicle will be AWD for sure."
