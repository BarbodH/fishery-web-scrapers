994405,Headhunter,2017-02-15 14:10:00,5703,"The Perfect Man A man walks out to the street and catches a taxi just going by. He gets into the taxi, and the cabbie says, ""Perfect timing. You're just like Frank.""Passenger: ""Who?""Cabbie: ""Frank Feldman. He's a guy who did everything right all the time. Like my coming along when you needed a cab, things happened like that to Frank Feldman every single time.""Passenger: ""There are always a few clouds over everybody.""Cabbie: ""Not Frank Feldman. He was a terrific athlete. He could have won the Grand-Slam at tennis. He could golf with the pros. He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and you should have heard him play the piano. He was an amazing guy.""Passenger: ""Sounds like he was really something special.""Cabbie: ""There's more. He had a memory like a computer. He remembered everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which foods to order and which fork to eat them with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse, and the whole street blacks out. But Frank Feldman could do everything right.""Passenger: ""Wow, what a guy!""Cabbie: ""He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her  back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman.""Passenger: ""How did you meet him?""Cabbie: ""I never actually met Frank. He died and I married his wife.""  HH"
