994397,BITEME,2017-02-15 13:11:00,1968,"I remember seeing this on channel 11 or hearing about it on CHML, extreme stuff. Are you making the run Biteme? What is the cause?  I have done Spartans in the past but it was more for a marker for me to know where my physical limits were and really just money paid to a business(entry fee) I saw this come up last year and decided that it was a good fit for me. I  spent a bunch of summers when I was a kid working for special needs groups and liked it a lot . so now in my older years I can still pound the ground and sweat and do my part to help out. cheers peter"
