There are so many places that are safe but plenty that aren't.  IF you do happen to hit open water on a sled PIN THE THROTTLE NOT THE BRAKES. Keep your weight off the skis go straight or turn slowly. I have run  25-30 feet of open water on 12 hp Elans without going down (never tried going further). I'm not saying this will save you but I can guarantee if you hit the brakes you WILL GO DOWN!
