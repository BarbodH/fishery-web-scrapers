Him and I were very close and a lot of guys from here knew him so after  his passing I put up a small post to tell of his death.  Months later my wife and I were sitting at home one evening and Joey and Paul came to visit. Joey was carrying a package and she gave it to me. I opened it and it was this beautiful 18"" x 24"" painting of my brother and I in my boat down at Quinte.  Joey had searched some old posts of mine and found the photograph.  There used to be a member here who painted pictures so Joey contacted her to do the work, then contacted other members who volunteered to donate money to help pay for it.  I knew nothing about it until that night.  It was one of the nicest gifts I've ever received and shows just how nice Joey was and what a wonderful friend she was.    "

And if I got out of line here she let me know it. I have 3 paintings on the go that are based on her magnificent photos. Finishing them is on the top of my list. My wife doesn't read our board but knew exactly who Joey is through her Artwork that Ticha has on her Pinterest page. When I told her this morning about her passing she was shocked like us all. She has touched so many people she had never met nor spoke to through her Art. She has left a legacy very few of us will ever have left. This is a sad day beyond explanation.
