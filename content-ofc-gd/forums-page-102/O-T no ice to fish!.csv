994778,pics,2017-02-19 14:36:00,1268,Warm here too...  Although I think people were crazy before it warmed up... Lol
994779,OhioFisherman,2017-02-19 15:00:00,6623,"LOL pics, I believe you may be right!  They are saying that we may break a record for the most consecutive days above 50 f in February that has stood since the 1930's here, like  8 days in a row? Winter here has been exceptionally mild, I don't think we have had more than 3 inches of snow on the ground at any one time.  That lake they are jumping in is right south of Akron Ohio, a series of small connected lakes, a bass factory! One of the few lakes here with homes all long the edges and a lot of fishing and boating traffic, a fun lake to fish."
