994576,spincast,2017-02-17 11:39:00,3279,"Buy used, let someone else take the 30% depreciation hit when he drives off the lot.  Same goes with boats. I always used to do that. But recently the difference between new and used ist what it used to be, And now I know what happened the first 60,000 k.  And for the OP - I had the older (ugly) version of the santa fe with the 2.5 litre. It had a zero interference engine - which resulted in some pretty expensive situations. The first one was caused by (we suspect, but it was never confirmed) a dishonest dealer who did most of the maintenance,  Either didn't change the timing belt, or did it poorly, 3000 k after that service, the belt broke and there was major damage to the engine. Hyundai did cover most of the cost. But, about 5000 k after that an  engine bearing failed and that destroyed the rebuilt engine. I'm pretty sure that bearing suffered damage in the first incident and it was just a matter of time. That one was lly my cost. Put a used motor in at a cost of just over 3k.  I only pulled my 16 footer with that vehicle a couple times, and it was pretty much all it could do.  When I upgraded the boat, I upgraded the vehicle. Now run a Rdigeline with a cap. Gives me 4 seats and a ton of safe cargo space. Pulls the 18 ftr with two motors, tackle, camping gear you name it no problem Rated for 5000 lbs. Same frame as the Pilot I believe,  I have over 220k kms on it. Replaced on lower control arem and one exhaust gas valve.  Averages between 10 litres per k highway and 12.8 city solo, and 17 per towing the boat.  Rides like a dream."

I will never buy another Chrysler yet many rave about them. The replacement came in at $1000.00 a pop. For that reason alone I will never buy another Chrysler. The most undependable brand I did drive was Mercedes Benz. I had 3 over the years and for some reason kept buying them. Parts could be triple the price of a North American car.

Fuel economy is awesome, the seats are really nice on longer drives, it just eats up snow and there's really nothing I would change about it.  But all three are excellent vehicles. You need to drive all three and see which you like best, since there are subtle differences in the seats, rear visibility, and the placement/layout of climate controls etc. But you really can't go wrong with any of the three, and you'll be shocked at the difference from a 10 year-old F150."

Also do you flush the tranny system completely when changing the fluid? Hoping to learn a few things here  The rear diff is completely different than a regular ring and pinion diff. It is electronically controlled by the vehicle's computers. When the computer senses slippage in the front wheels it will apply power to the rear. The inside of the rear diff looks exactly like the clutches in an automatic transmission. As the clutches wear the oil becomes contaminated (just like in an automatic transmission). Because the diff holds significantly less fluid and does not have an external cooler the fluid ages more quickly. If you leave it too long you can actually feel vibrations in the diff. It is a pretty quick job to drain and fill with fresh fluid so it's not a huge deal at all. It doesn't take any longer than doing an oil change.
