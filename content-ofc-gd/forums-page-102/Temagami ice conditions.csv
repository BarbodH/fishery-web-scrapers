994334,irishfield,2017-02-14 19:15:00,26272,"Call them and ask for the very latest conditions!  As of Sunday night I was told the main hub area is starting to slush up. Ice was about 11"" or better. Road is plowed to Bear Island, so maybe Tamar has been able to get a road WAAYYY down to their location in the South Arm.  NE Arm.. my location... is a slush field apparently. No ice roads.. sleds only."
994345,Joeytier,2017-02-14 21:19:00,3990,I sledded down a good chunk of the last Sunday (the 5th).  They were just plowing the ice road that day so it should be set up nice now.  There was a fair amount of snow on the lakes then and we've been getting hammered with snow up here last few days so there will be lots of snow and likely some slush even on the big lake.  Backlakes will be horrifically slushy by this weekend I'd imagine.

994386,Joeytier,2017-02-15 02:35:00,3990,"It's gonna be mild and sloppy, don't forget the rubber boots, and breadbags if necessary"
994390,smitty55,2017-02-15 04:41:00,928,Check out this thread. Jeff from Tamar has been posting regularly. https://www.oodmag.com/community/showthread.php?89034-Temagami  Cheers
994426,zenon11,2017-02-15 17:32:00,75,"Thanks, I'll be sure to keep my eye on it."
994540,wuchikubo,2017-02-16 22:10:00,1114,"I am not sure about Tamar's spot, but I was up at Bluehaven last week. 12-14"" of ice on top was about 15-20 cm of snow. We caught some whitefish, ling and OOS lakers (one was about 10 lbs). The whitefish and ling had 90% shrimp in their stomach when checked. Smaller was better for the most part last week. Not sure about this week."
