The unit is dual beam at 200/455khz, so Im guessing that is where the issue is. The problem is Humminbird dont make a transducer with 200/455khz. They make an ice ducer for their ICE models which  is 455/240khz which I imagine wouldnt work either.  I guess my question is how can I get this to work if at all. And if it doesnt, why on earth would they make a portable unit not capable for ice fishing."

994382,Tjames09,2017-02-15 01:30:00,664,Wow thanks for the reply. I couldn't get it to exit sim mode on the lake but now I'm home it will. I will have to try again to make sure 100%. I noticed it only had 2 pins not 3.

994409,Tjames09,2017-02-15 15:11:00,664,"Stupid things, you'd think they'd make all the transducers compatible.  you know whats weird is I called humminbird Canada customer service and the guy on the phone had no idea. He didnt know that the transducer wouldn't work, and he certainly didnt have a work around. Its like he knew nothing about their products."
