He took his nine year old nephew out ice fishing and he also went through, but bystanders were able to get to the young boy.  Temps were +10 yesterday.  Just moved to Waterford last year and so wanted to ice fish, but my gut kept telling me not.  Not sure how to paste link so if you just go to Norfolk News you should get the whole story."
994838,FloatnFly,2017-02-20 00:58:00,1640,"why do people risk their safety for a dam fish!  temps were warmer than the +10 me think, probably closer to +15, and that sun was pretty strong.  ice will be gone this week"

994854,Tom S,2017-02-20 03:49:00,362,"This is tragic, as no one in their right mind should have been out on ice in this area. It's been way to warm for any ice out this way to be safe."
