994924,Tjames09,2017-02-20 21:38:00,664,Looking at used boats. Wondering what is an acceptable number of hours on a motor?  There's a used boat 2014 60hp with 280 hours of use.
994926,Gallie,2017-02-20 21:45:00,1215,"Im not sure there a wrong amount, if the motor has been properly serviced and maintained then number of hours shouldnt matter other than to use it in your pricing like you would km on a car. If its got 100,000 hours it might be a bit tired lol."
994930,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-20 22:19:00,8243,"Like Gallie says it's not the hours it how it was maintained. There are plenty of 40 year old, and older, engines that run like new. Buddy Ted has a 60's era Evinrude 9.9 that cold starts on the first pull. He is the one that has shown me how important maintenance is. I know guys that have new engines that run like poop because they run them WOT and don't maintain them or the fuel they run. I have never run any of my 2 engines on anything but hi octane ethanol free fuel. The extra pennies a litre to me makes sence to run the best fuel available. I change plugs and fuel filter every spring and wires every other season. Over kill? Maybe. I want the things to start just be looking at them and I have to look at the Tach to see if my 2 stroke 115 is running she's so quiet."
994933,ecmilley,2017-02-20 22:27:00,2163,hooked up optimaxes to the puter to log well over a 1000 hours and still running perfect all in the maintenance
994935,mike rousseau,2017-02-20 22:38:00,4661,If it's under 100 hours per year old your doing good in my opinion  If it's under 50 hours per year it's a gem  Anything more than 100 hours per year requires multiple oil changes per year and most guys I know only change oil once a year... that's why I think under 100 per year is ok
994937,Pigeontroller,2017-02-20 22:51:00,2793,280 is LOW hours for a 2014.
994940,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-20 22:58:00,8243,I can usually tell how someone has maintained their mechanical systems simply by looking at their vehicle and the boat itself. If the boat is a mess and the truck hasn't been washed in a year and is full of Tim Horton cups and McDonalds bags I bet my bottom dollar the maintenance on their engine is just as bad. Not always but it is very rare that if someone tends to not take care of their other stuff the mechanical stuff hasn't been taken care of either. Heck I have called it when pulling up to someone's house when looking at a vehicle to buy. If they care as much about the vehicle as they do their home I don't want to even see it.
994941,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-20 22:59:00,10439,"I think anything under 600 will last you a long, long time. I just started the install of a sweet lease return motor on a buddies boat this weekend. It is a 2016 90hp Merc with about 400 hours on it. He saved over 20% of the cost new and this thing doesn't look like it's seen water except for the hours on it."
994943,mike rousseau,2017-02-20 23:11:00,4661,Also hours don't tell the full story  Hours at RPM tells more  My motor had 1200 hours in 3 years but like 800-900 were under 1000 rpm cause o troll walleye a lot... 1200 hours at 5500 rpm is a big difference
994952,aplumma,2017-02-21 00:04:00,6896,"Spend the money to have a mechanic look it over he can tell by looking at the pistons, plugs and possibly hook it up to a computer what shape it is in. While he will not give you a guarantee he can make you comfortable with the price you paid. A good maintenance program has keep my gtx150 from 1989 on a ranger boat running like it is new for 28 years.   Art"
994957,OhioFisherman,2017-02-21 00:50:00,6623,"Too many variables to give answer, if the motor was used a dozen times a season it's a lot of hours, if it was used 50 times a season it's not many, like others mentioned, how well was it cared for?"
994961,npt1,2017-02-21 01:13:00,220,"I worked in a Machine Shop for many years and I will tell you this. Lubrication is a key point to make any equipment last a long time, Filters are important also.  With marine engines, wires are a key component to longevity and use fresh hi octane fuel.  Now its trivia time,  How many folks here remember  Murray Westgate, He was a spokesman for ESSO oil commercials during hockey games. He always said  ""Happy Motoring""  and ""Let's get back to the game"". If you remember him, you have been around for a while,  lol"

If you remember him, you have been around for a while,  lol  Also in those pre Global network days, CBLT Toronto was on channel 6 later moving to channel 5. I remember as dad had no remotes in the 50/60's. Think it was the Wednesday Leaf game you would catch already in progress, usually in the 2nd period."
994969,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-21 04:37:00,8243,"I had a remote control in 1960, my little brother. He sat by the TV and I told him what channel of all 8 available to turn it to."
