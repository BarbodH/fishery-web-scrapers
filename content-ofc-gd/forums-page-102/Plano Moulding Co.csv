994370,Fisherman,2017-02-15 01:03:00,7201,"I have one of those smaller black plastic boxes they use for break down shotguns, foam lined.  I use it for ice fishing rods and unfortunately lost one of the plastic clips that keeps it shut.  Emailed them and requested a replacement at my cost and shipping.   Got a quick email back,  they will be sent to you at company expense.  Today I got 4 in the mail, no charge.  Good company that helps out the customer."
994373,Fisherpete,2017-02-15 01:13:00,1814,"Plano has done this a few times for me also - very happy with them. Have to respect companies that stand behind their products. I have one of their polycarbonate dry boxes also - really bad latch design on this one, had one break clean off last year. Emailed them to get a replacement latch - at my expense - and they actually said I was out of luck because another company makes this item for them and they don't stock replacement parts. Bit disappointed as the dry boxes are a bit pricey... but overall Plano has been great."
994435,Rattletrap2,2017-02-15 20:57:00,1652,Always good to hear when a company comes through for the consumer! These are the folks we need to support so they stay in business!
994436,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-15 21:26:00,8243,Good to hear something positive for once. I have many Plano boxes some for over 25 years. Never a problem with them.
994537,mike rousseau,2017-02-16 21:57:00,4661,Wow  Great to hear
994539,craigdritchie,2017-02-16 22:05:00,1586,"Plano has a very long history of fantastic customer service. The reason you seldom hear about it is because as Old Ironmaker says, most of the stuff they make lasts forever without any issues at all. They're a great company who stand behind their truly wonderful products."
994599,206,2017-02-17 16:04:00,563,I had similar experience with them....The front door on my 787 broke and i had had it for sometime. I called to purchase a replacement and they sent it out free of charge and in a timely manner!
