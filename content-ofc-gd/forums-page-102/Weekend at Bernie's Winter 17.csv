994420,Headhunter,2017-02-15 16:48:00,5703,"Our winter trip up to Bernie's place on Nip took place this past weekend. Bernie had hooked us up with his outfitter friend that put us in one of their ice condo's for the weekend. These folks were fantastic at keeping us well outfitted and fully baited. Fishing was pretty slow, with only four Pickereyes caught in total for the four of us. Nothing in the slot, so they went back. What did LI learn from the weekend? Well, four guys in an ice condo, confined spaces, one should probably consider the meals and the ""results""! A word of advice to those willing to listen; -don't serve Brussel sprouts -don't serve steamed purple cabbage -don't serve heavily garliced noodles -don't serve beef barley soup for lunch the next day (Will it was delicious!!!) -don't serve corn on the cob after all of the above! We left early Sunday as there was a concern with the weather and what could have resulted in a ""three hour tour"". The fishing was slow, so we didn't feel like we were going to be missing out. The other guys have some pics, hoping they will chime in with them for yah! Thanks again Bernie! I'm still hunting down a copy of ""Ray""! HH  "

994428,Headhunter,2017-02-15 17:53:00,5703,Let's just say that it was advantageous that the hut was frozen into the ice! HH
994432,Jds63,2017-02-15 18:36:00,1365,That's a bummer ...
994440,misfish,2017-02-15 21:56:00,29133,Now you wouldn't of had an issue with fried bait and eggs for breakfast. Atleast you would of had fish of some sort. LOL  Glad you boys had a good time none the less Joe.
994442,Terry,2017-02-15 22:13:00,14456,always an adventure dont get bummed out
994443,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-15 22:15:00,8243,"Nothing wrong with fried shinners. They are a son of a gun to fillet though. HH, lucky you guys didn't have a Methane gas monitor in the shack, no one would get any sleep. NO SMOKING."
994445,npt1,2017-02-15 22:19:00,220,"Hey,  sounds like that trip was a  ""gas"""
994446,limeyangler,2017-02-15 22:39:00,5204,sounds like a bunch of old 'farts'.........lol
994451,Joeytier,2017-02-15 23:08:00,3990,"Too bad the fishing didn't pan out.  The mid-winter slump is definitely in full-swing, and most of the structure close to shore that gets hot early season really seems to die down."
994468,ccmtcanada,2017-02-16 01:37:00,7971,Here are some pics from the weekend!  Always a fantastic time up at Bernie's place. Having a nice comfy bungalow to fish in was awesome!          
994472,LeXXington,2017-02-16 03:18:00,1928,looks like a good time
994483,Terry,2017-02-16 11:04:00,14456,Looks like fun. If you had longer arms that fish would be huge lol
994486,ccmtcanada,2017-02-16 12:25:00,7971,I didn't want to be too obvious...lol
994488,Headhunter,2017-02-16 13:42:00,5703,"Anyone else notice in the pics that three guys are smiling and one isn't? (well, he might be under all the duck dynasty stuff!) HH"
994514,Bernie,2017-02-16 19:38:00,3190,I'd bet Lew can see me smiling. Great fun as always fellas!
994533,lew,2017-02-16 21:40:00,12766,I'd bet Lew can see me smiling.   Never could understand why so many can't see the obvious Bernie  Always enjoy reading of the Bernie weekends up north.
994594,Headhunter,2017-02-17 13:59:00,5703,Not as much as we enjoy be part of them Lew! HH
994617,Cast-Away,2017-02-17 18:51:00,790,"Hey Bernie, you must be from Midland wearing a Pillsbury shirt! I think all of th employees wear them LOL"
994671,irishfield,2017-02-18 03:09:00,26272,Pillsbury is done like their dough in an oven! Closing here very soon!  Another good gig guys...
994673,Bernie,2017-02-18 03:47:00,3190,Ya I'm an original dough boy. My wife got a bunch of the shirts on a mail in.
994680,Cast-Away,2017-02-18 05:03:00,790,Sorry to hear that the plant is closing. Any idea why Wayne?
