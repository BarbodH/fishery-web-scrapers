993921,John Bacon,2017-02-10 14:48:00,3277,If you're targeting bass out of season you can be charged with that even if you release them in the water and I wouldn't want to be the guy throwing musky baits with a conservation licence if your going to fish for them buy the sport licence or should we just forget about all the rules lol. Tight Lines SBK We're not forgetting about the rules.  We just understand the rules well enough to know that it is completely legal to fish for muskie with a conservation license as long as any that are caught are released immediately.
993946,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-10 16:46:00,8243,"Who's keeping a Musky? Mmmmmm, Musky.  If you have the catch limit of any species of fish, and they are all dead can I keep fishing for that species? I say no. If 1 is alive I can cull it."

I say no. If 1 is alive I can cull it. Does no one read the regulations, page 7 2016 regs it says ""If you catch a fish after reaching the daily catch or possession limit for that species, the fish must be released immediately back to the water (see Ontarioâ€™s Catch and Retain Rules, page 9). If the limit is zero, anglers may practise catch and release only, and any fish caught must be released immediately back into the water in a manner that does not harm the fish. For some species there are no limits and no reference will be made to a limit in this summary (see Size Limits, page 8)."

994101,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-02-11 20:06:00,535,I actually asked a retired game warden that I know about this. He said you can still fish for them and basically a warden would have to be a big jerk to ticket you if you're releasing them. Maybe just pay the extra $10 and not worry about it.

Why would you be ticketed anyway for doing something perfectly legal?  You  ARE allow to fish C&R for species with a zero limit....The musky limits are S-1 & C-0 in most areas so you're not doing anything wrong in the first place...

The musky limits generally are S-1 C-0 so you may catch and retain 1 fish with a sports licence and you may catch but not retain any if you have a C.  Anyway, if you're really that concerned about this, just buy the sportfishing license and be done with it."

994140,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-02-12 12:01:00,535,"Hey I'm not disagreeing here at all. I just don't expect every single officer/warden to know everything. Human error is always a possibility. While a wrongful ticket would get thrown out, it's still a big inconvenience. I'd rather not risk anything and I always buy the sports fishing licence anyway.  I've heard of guys having their hunting rifles confiscated by young cops because they had them unloaded and in plain view on their seat, which is perfectly legal. They got them back without any fines but they still had to drive to the cop shop and get it sorted out.  There are tons of people bad at their jobs. I'm sure law enforcement is no different."
994556,RHK,2017-02-17 00:15:00,15,"We had a CO out at a Hamilton Chapter meeting for Muskies Canada last year and this was the first question he was hit with after his presentation. His reply was you can fish Muskie with a conservation license, you just can not keep one like the law states. As for doing a picture, technically no, but he said all the CO's he knows would not ticket you if you are handling the fish properly with respect and get it released fast. in other words remove the hooks in the net, up and out for the pic then back in the water to swim away to catch another day in a minute or 2 at the most. If you are a tool, bring the fish in the boat, leaving it on the floor celebrating and such and taking your time, taking 20 hero shots,  endangering the fish, then ya you will get a ticket."

He mentioned that you need a sport license to target muskie as the C&R limit is zero.  It seems the regulations arent super clear, but it does say this:   https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-limits-size-restrictions-and-catch-and-release#section-7  Thoughts?"

I have been told by a CO you can angle for them but they must be released immediately. I was always under the impression with a Con. licence possession  is zero, not 1. I don't know where TJames copied that quote from.  Immediately to me means right away, no picture taking, measuring, admiring. If I recall a few Pro's making a TV show were charged for taking a picture of a out of season Bass. I don't know about reviving it in a livewell. I wouldn't even bring it onboard. On my Musky charter any smaller fish that wasn't going to be photographed Dan Columby de hooked the fish in the net and released it from the net without touching the fish. One fish that was hooked deep he cut the hook off with bolt cutters and let it slide out of the net."

To make this totally clear, you may angle for the musky, you may not keep any.  It is no different than in parry sound harbour where the lake trout season is open, however the catch limit is 0.  You can fish all day and catch 100 but you immediately have to put them all back. No CO is going to crush you for taking a photo with a fish that is in season.  If you are poaching Bass off of their spawning beds or throwing twin 10s at skis out a season and then taking photos thats an entirely different story.  ill tell you right now if i catch a 55 inch georgian bay musky out of season on walleye gear, its getting a photo before the release, im just not going to post it on social media lol"

You can fish for them no problems what so ever, you just can't keep any. but really, who keeps a musky anyway?"
