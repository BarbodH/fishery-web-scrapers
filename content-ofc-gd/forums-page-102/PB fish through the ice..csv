Beauty weather, beautiful scenery... and one damn nice fish. Unfortunately, no other fish came out to play... but, this one made my day, and my ice season. The biggest fish, weight wise, that I have pulled through the ice. The longest fish, was a pike about an inch or two longer. This walleye measured 28.5"" long, and about 7.5-8lbs.   "

994949,Locnar,2017-02-20 23:42:00,645,"Thanks guys, I was pretty friggin psyched when I pulled 'er outta that hole. Would like to get back there again and give that lake another go. I was expecting smaller eyes, 16-18"" range, so I was using a tiny panfish ice rod with 4lb line. Was a bit of an event bringing that thing in.  Hopefully the weather allows another outing or two. But at the same time, I do look forward to some ice out pike fishing, and early spring carping."
