994918,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-20 21:05:00,8243,"I am still trying guys. Over and over again the entire slideshow downloads to here. My OFC site doesn't work as designed in the last 6 months, can't use the quote feature or copy and paste a link like before. The upper tool bar that has Bold, Italics, font etc. plus the window where I am supposed to click to post a pic is on the same upper toolbar doesn't light up, sometimes, sometimes it does. I dunno. I really want to show you all the 3 Pics I caught last year! Yes that is a laff out loud.  M2, I think it would be easier to land a space shuttle using your phone. I have nothing that looks like that here on W/10."
