If someone claims that link hosted a trojan, then I will defer because I have no idea if that is true or even possible.  If you have a trojan on your puter, try Adaware - I just did a scan, found some tracking cookies and deleted them.  The next scan was clean.  Thanks to the Moderator that deleted that website on that phony link."

Keep on trucking douG  G"
182426,irishfield,2008-04-05 22:03:00,26272, Man have we all got you fooled bud... we're just all dang terrified that you'll beat us up if we don't act nice to you!  And Jonnybass... ask anyone here.. I call'm as I see'm (on the keyboard and in person!) and if you can't handle that save yourself a whole world of hurt and go on with your life elsewhere !

It happens all the time.....the webserver becomes compromised and then it is open season.

182436,TJQ,2008-04-05 22:21:00,7806," That is exactly correct...  but by being correct it gives the perception that there is an old boys club..  there no ""list"".. what there is however is perhaps a bit of leeway thats allowed for member who have been here a long long time.. just the way it is..  and if any one calls me an old boy again.. ill kick your butt!  and I tell ya what.. if anyone ever posted something that knowingly messed with someone else computer.. it wouldn't be allowed and it would be removed quickly as simple as that..."

182531,aplumma,2008-04-06 01:23:00,6896,Actually you can be a newbie and join the good old boys club. All's you need to do is preform a few selfless acts and help out people without tooting your horn all over the place. I have in the past asked T.J. for a few favors dealing with another fishing site and he was nice enough to help me. As I have in the past and on to the future I will continue helping as many people as I can. If that is part of the good old boys network then I am proud to be a member.   Art
182552,OhioFisherman,2008-04-06 02:08:00,6623,The old boys club? Been here a while and didn`t know there was a senior citizens section to the board.
182619,Marc Thorpe,2008-04-06 10:21:00,621,"Entry fee for Old Boys Club = 24 Old Milwaukee  Gerrit cant be in the Old Boys Club,he's still changing diapers  Virus,the only one I know who got a virus was when TJ did his Honda VOD : Venereal Outboard disease He put a new meaning in lube job"
182637,Greencoachdog,2008-04-06 13:25:00,8163," VOD!!!... that's nasty Marc, I like the way you think!!!    The ""Old Boys Club"" isn't all it's cracked up to be:  The beer is hot.  The rum is watered down.  The Go-Go girls are all ex USO show dance card girls from WWII. Watching them try to do the Frug while hanging onto their walkers doesn't do anything for me... yet."
182645,Beans,2008-04-06 13:45:00,3339,  Make sure that it comes in bottles not cans...I made the mistake and my membership was deferred two years...eh Roy
182693,maybe,2008-04-06 15:13:00,307," About 2 years ago, I set an unprotected system online to see how long it'd take something nasty to find it.  No surfing, no email, no downloading, brand new clean system sitting still.  15 minutes into the test, I checked its drive - and it'd already been infected.  Anything that can move on its own, and really wants to find a new home, can do so by brute force.  Every machine online has an IP number.  There's a finite # of those.  A worm with time on its hands can sit there and try every # in sequence looking for a vulnerable machine.  Think of it as a thief walking up and down the rows in a parking lot, looking for open car windows.  douG, I'd say you're in the clear - it's been hours since I tried the joke URL, and nothing's happened to the test machine.  Dangit, Gerritt...I think I've finally started to like you.        Thanks for showing there really is a gooey center in there somewhere."
182700,Roy,2008-04-06 15:29:00,13728,Gooey is probably the best description of Gerritt that I've ever heard. WTG!
182701,Greencoachdog,2008-04-06 15:31:00,8163," Yeah, but the gooey is inbetween his ears!!!"
182831,workwear,2008-04-06 20:39:00,592,has anyone heard of the program deep freeze....i use it and its awwwwwwwsome.......im not computer savy but i think it works this way.....this program takes a pic of your perfect drive....and everytime you retart it it clears any viruses and returns back to a normal setting.....ya need to partition the drive with all the executables into one area since most nasty things like the executables...and any data that ya want to save will be in the second partition....can be a little pain when wanting to add a new program...but well worth the effort.....i can surf endlessly and never have to worry bout any viruses.....if i get infected.....shut it down reboot to my original hard drive!!!  dont know where to get it as my brother BORROWED this program from work....but it is awwwwwsome  cheers
182348,Terry,2008-04-05 19:42:00,14456,"now wait solopaddler has be here about a year and one half..hardly  in the old boys club.....LOL..a good fisherman who can tell a great story with pictures Irishfield I think I have been around here 3 times as long or longer,  he just posts  a lot and helps out anyone who needs it along the way.did I say he post a lot ......I will pay for that one  just because someone around here states his opinion, doesn't mean he's in the old boys club.. I know. cause I'm the doorman for the club........ people around here do state what they think.......it's not a personal attack...just their opinion"
182351,Gerritt,2008-04-05 19:52:00,6129,I have been around aloooong time as well.... I am not part of the old boys club either... infact I am barely tolerated..  G
182355,Roy,2008-04-05 19:55:00,13728,"But that's your own fault, Gerritt. I told you not to buy a centerpin!"
182357,Deano,2008-04-05 20:02:00,767,"time for this post to die, I'm not in the club either, but many post die after me. LOL"
182358,Gerritt,2008-04-05 20:03:00,6129,  True I should have listened! LOL..... Ohhh I should not have talked politics with Canadave as well .... I think my stance on the seal hunt and who in fact owns the arctic might have had something to do with it... Ohhh well live and learn.. My only comeback to him was... I saw you in Bass pyjamas.. lol  G
182359,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-05 20:07:00,1183,"Funny...all the boys in the ""boys club"" are the only ones responding.  Sorry...couldn't resist...just fooling with yas."
182364,Gerritt,2008-04-05 20:17:00,6129,"Twilight want in? It'll cost yah though.... 7 years of your free time sounds appropriate LOL  Just kidding...  There really is not some inner sanctum here, there is no conspiracy either..... some people just know each other better.... only reason for that is the time committed by the individual... Some of us have met on many occasions be it on fishing trips, swills or just to help one another out... is there a greater community here at work then just chatting on the board? For sure their is.. and anyone can be a part of it if they choose... All they have to do is be selfless of them selves, Show up at events and network and put yourself out there!..  Trust me not everyone is going to like you, and that is ok! we are all very different individuals.. but you will find the people you feel comfortable with and you too will have more then just the board alone can offer....  I cant say it any plainer..  Put yourself out there... and think of someone other then you're self... and you would be surprised at some of the amazing friendships that can be formed...  G"
182367,Handlebarz,2008-04-05 20:19:00,3790,JB you need to buy a Mac I did not get any virus from the link.   I am in the FF club and was not aware of the change of name thanks for the heads up.  All kidding aside the nice weather is here and things will be back to normal soon enough this is a huge family and were disfunctional at most times just stick it out you will see that you are welcome here and we dont come across the same on the puter.  Oh heck maybe its just you LOL JK hope ya stick around to see what this place is like.
182373,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-05 20:32:00,1183,"haha  Gerritt  ....no, no...I do not want in.  I like my freedom.  Just to be fair to the newbies as I too was one not that long ago.  It does take time to gain some respect and there are certain members who because of the friendships formed, do take a different role when one of their ""friends"" is being...for lack of a better word...criticized.  Take you and I for example.  I hated your guts.  hahaha    That's not true Gerritt...I am just trying to bring some humour here.  But...one time you did tell me something that yes hurt me, but also woke me up.  I was utilizing this board to help me with a personal issue.  You pointed out to me how wrong it was for me do that.  I didn't like hearing it, but I respected you for that.  I now attend psycho therapy twice a week, am on anti-depressants and run into walls on occasion.  (again just kidding)  There is always something to learn from constructive criticism."
182379,Gerritt,2008-04-05 21:02:00,6129,"   Ahhhh..... but you are free... Free to associate yourself with whom you feel comfortable with.... with life you will not get along with everybody.. to think so is foolhardy... everyone has their detractors. but you can not let those people define who you are or how you carry/define yourself... Be yourself and you will have already earned your respect....  I am sorry if I hurt your feelings in the past... but the things I told you needed to be said at the time. You seemed like a strong woman that was a touch confused and was coming here looking for advice but being new you were exposing yourself too much, I said what I said to prevent you from taking any more abuse because of the nature of you're posts... I did not post with the intention of hurting your feelings.. infact the exact opposite.. to prevent you from being attacked from the masses... I hope you can see that now..  I also hope you understand my intentions.  I am who I am.. I am opinionated, passionate and sometimes brutally honest... some people can accept me for who I am... some see me as offencive (usually those that have something to hide)... others to be honest wish they could just be like the rest of us.... somehow.. we seem to make this work.. and for that reason they feel the need to try and break it down.  I have made hundreds of great friends on this board.. and sure I got my hand slapped from time to time... but I know they are doing it because they honestly care.... it is when people dont care what you do... that you have to be worried.... why? it means they have given up...  Alot of these people have seen me at my absolute LOWEST... picked me up, brushed me off and helped me along my way... some are still helping me now.. (They know who they are) Alot of people here on this board have not walked in my shoes, or for that matter the shoes of alot of the members here.. and have NO idea the amount of support we have all received... that is what unites us.. The care for one another when the chips are down and a hand to help you get back up...   I owe this board and some of its members WAY more then I could ever describe in this post.  Twilight your in good hands trust me... Your an OFC'r  G"
182387,douG,2008-04-05 21:15:00,2693,Now I'm verklempt.
182389,Greencoachdog,2008-04-05 21:17:00,8163," Yeah, ya gotta watch this douG guy... he's a real rascallion!!!"
182395,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-05 21:23:00,1183,"Gerritt....thank you, a little late but you helped me when I needed it most.  I know that I am in good hands here...I just get a bit sensitive at times but otherwise I am simply the ""best"".  Now I am going to have a BBQ with my boys."
