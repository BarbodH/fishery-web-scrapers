Any people been on these bodies of water. I would apprecaite any assistance I cen get.  I am looking for somewhere safe for kids (sandy shoreline), good fishing, and ease of renting a boat perhaps. This is our one week we do every year, and I just want to make sure that the kids get a good week, and i get some reasonable fishing as well.  Much Appreciated once again.  Lakeshore"
