182884,Gerritt,2008-04-06 23:07:00,6129,Well Today was a nice day so I figured I better get the boat going... May 24 is fast approaching!  I made sure when I first purchased the boat that I got the front floor done... as it on such an incline I could see an ankle being snapped.... I left it at that... knowing full well I would be starting the rear Floor this spring...  This is to give the guys out there looking at doing their floor a bit of insight   Main Brackets     Cross members      The small rear section...          I also got my new GPS Chartplotter installed today... Works like a champ!  Now to cut the Marine Plywood and put in the decking...  Add the new FishFinder  and the Stereo...  Now... please let weather stay nice!!!!!  G
182890,ccmtcanada,2008-04-06 23:10:00,7971,"Awesome stuff Gerritt!  I hope this means you are starting to feel better now!  I'll be taking the boat out of the garage next weekend....start the motor, mount some rod holders, lighting check etc...  Ahhh....I can almost taste open water fishing...."

182897,Gerritt,2008-04-06 23:15:00,6129,   Ahhh Yes... I need to vacuum and wash her down before the floor goes in... She is sleeping amoungst the trees... and this is the first time I have had her open since last fall.... some crap got in there...  She says she is sorry she showed her dirty dirty Diiiiiiiiirty behind  G

182929,danc,2008-04-06 23:38:00,4677,It'll be at least a month before I get to that chore Gerritt. In fact we had a snow storm move in last night after several 12 and 13C days. Back to winter for a while now.
182932,Gerritt,2008-04-06 23:42:00,6129,"Bernie, Dan....   Trust me you will all have time to open your wallets LOL... better to delay the inevitable!  G"

182939,silveradosheriff,2008-04-06 23:50:00,1025,Hey Gerritt - did you pick up a marine radio yet?
182944,Gerritt,2008-04-06 23:55:00,6129,I was there @ Angling Outfitters yesterday... Jos almost had me grabbing one.... Expect I already had my budget in my hands... I will probably pick up the Lowrance unit next month.. then add the 8' Antenna....  will it ever end? LOL   Did you pick it up yet??? and what about your experiment?? conclusion?  G
182947,medmart,2008-04-06 23:59:00,587,Nice job Gerritt look forward to seeing it finished  Rob
182948,Jigger,2008-04-07 00:05:00,1237,"Looks good, Gerritt. Smart move using the aluminum bracing. I did the same thing to my ride last year. Its expensive, sure. But you'll never have to touch it again. Keep up the good work!"
182968,silveradosheriff,2008-04-07 00:39:00,1025,Good down next weekend to pick up a few more Catalinas and most likely a radio.  Experiment remains a work in progress....  :-)
