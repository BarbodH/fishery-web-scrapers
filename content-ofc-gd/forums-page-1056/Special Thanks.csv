182271,Stoty,2008-04-05 15:44:00,2910,"Just wanted to thank Cranks Bait (Scott) for purchasing an ice auger for me when he found out I couldnt get one in Pickering. And also Tinbanger (Dave) for picking up the auger in Brockville, and meeting up with me in Pickering to deliver it!  Good to see that there are still people like you two around. I owe you both a big thanks.  Much appreciated!  Cheers, *Stoty"
