183333,Stoty,2008-04-07 19:19:00,2910," LOL, I cant say that I have heard that one before!!!  But I have a funny feeling this thread is about to come to an end!  It had a good run though. BY FAR my most successful thread.  All in all, its going to be a heck of a playoffs. Toss up in both conferences, with no real favorites! Good luck to all teams.  Cheers, *Stoty"

183340,Roy,2008-04-07 19:34:00,13728,I'm glad you're all friends. It's usually the non fishing threads that show how folks react to statements in various situations. Nice.
183301,Puckhead,2008-04-07 18:12:00,377," No question this is all down to Ferguson's ineptness - I can't blame McCabe either for taking the money.  If someone wanted to overpay me, I wouldn't turn it down either... But now that Ferguson is gone, McCabe is in the crosshairs.  I'd keep Kaberle.  They need at least one puck carrying defencemen and Kaberle has a fair contract. Kubina has played himself into getting a good return in a trade so that should be good this offseason - just hope it happens before the draft.  TSN reported the following on the trades that would have happened if these guys didn't have no trades clauses:  Sundin to Anaheim for 2 solid prospects and Edmonton's #1 pick this year. OR Sundin to Montreal for Higgins, a #1 pick in 08 and a third rounder.  Kaberle to Philly for Jeff Carter and a 2nd rounder  Kubina to SJ for a #1 pick and a prospect.  The remaining leafs after the trade deadline would have mailed it in and we would have had a great shot at a Stamkos.  Just think of what could have been and it makes you want to cry:  Carter, Higgins, 2 other solid prospects plus 3 first round picks, a couple of #2's in what is considered the deepest draft in over a decade and have shed a ton of salary.  Two of those three picks would have been top ten.  Damn..............................."
183307,Stoty,2008-04-07 18:18:00,2910, LOOOOOL  Since when am I a Habs fan????????  I think you should take some of your own advice...
183312,xrap,2008-04-07 18:27:00,683,"  yea, since when is Spezza a habs fan?"
183317,Stoty,2008-04-07 18:39:00,2910, Hahahah
183324,ehg,2008-04-07 19:00:00,2666,This thread is becoming a waste of bandwith.
183034,brickNblock,2008-04-07 02:35:00,598,and......... I will not visit a McCabesucks website........ Regardless of what I feel may be close to the truth or the opposite.
183035,Stoty,2008-04-07 02:37:00,2910," Apparently that shows that your common sense skills arent up to par. Its a little thing called ""sarcasm"". As for my hockey insight...lol...i think I can hold my own.  Wow, you really love McMoron eh. Look at those stats you pulled from a McCabe Fan Club page or something. That about shows how good your hockey insight is, if you think he is even in the top 20 defenseman in the league."
183041,Pinch,2008-04-07 02:47:00,231,"  Its ok, the list was upside down!!! lol He meant the bottom 20!!!"
183155,fatherof3,2008-04-07 13:04:00,1769,"well,after re-reading this post numerous times it amazes me that with all the numbers thrown around that no one actually looked up the stats.From the NHLPA website not some fan website here they are for any interested. Drafted 2rd,40th overall. This year finished 10th on the leaf team for scoring. This year finished tied in 68th spot for denfensemen. Now to the interesting part,career.These stats are for all active NHL players again taken from the NHLPA website and not some fan site. Ranked 99th overall among ALL active skaters(Sundin is 5th) Ranked 19th or 20th among All active defensemen. The point for this is according to definition and not opinion makes him a top 20 defensemen at least point wise over his career.Do I like him as player? No. Do I think he is overpaid? Yes. I just think before some get into diagreements with others and insults start that maybe facts and stats should be looked at first.Sure he does some pretty lame things on the ice but show me a player who has not in his career.This is coming from a Leaf fan who does not even like McCabe but I at least got my facts straight first.My opinion?He screwed us at the deadline and should be traded for cheaper,younger talent with a no trade clause(if possible).There is my rant now everyone go fish,lol."
183164,Roy,2008-04-07 13:30:00,13728,He's the 10th scorer on a team that's in the cellar? hmmmmm
183169,fatherof3,2008-04-07 13:38:00,1769,"By no means am I saying he had a good year.I am sure most of the Leafs would rather forget this one,lol.It just bugs me when I see arguements/insults with no facts used.Career wise by his stats he is not as bad as some would say.10th place on this team(23 points in 53 games)was quite an accomplishment for sure,lol."
182784,walleyejigger,2008-04-06 18:39:00,876,"first off GO HABS GO  second i'm not going to continue this discussion cause we've had it many times before and it's always the same and i'm too lazy  third i didn't want to start another hockey thread on this board  so..... my comment is, anyone see the canucks/ flames game last night, the standing ovation for linden at the beginning of the third then the end of the game and the flames staying back to shake his hand, was great to see and ver deserved for one of the true gentlemen in the game, even though he wasn't a ""superstar""  although he didn't announce his retirement it looked pretty clear he was done  congrats Trevor enjoyed watchin u play the game and wish there were more of you out there  quick fact.... did u know Islanders trade Bertuzzi, Mccabe and a 3rd rounder for Linden, and in his daraft class he was #2 overall, 1st was Mike Modano  GO HABS GO"
182794,silveradosheriff,2008-04-06 19:25:00,1025,"Well said, young Jedi!  :-)"
182796,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-06 19:25:00,2585,i watched the fight in slow motion this morning and clearly mccabe landed the better punches.  the slash was clearly stupid but he sure didnt get his --- kicked.  3 punches were right on the face of stewart and only one punch stewart chucked seemed to be even close to landing.  Cheers!
182805,Stoty,2008-04-06 19:46:00,2910,"LOL  Those two YouTube Clips sum it up pretty much!!! USELESS!!  Pretty tough with the stick, on a rookie. Lets see him try that with Brasher. Or better yet, Chara...who literally threw him around like a rag doll, while he was turtling!!!!"
