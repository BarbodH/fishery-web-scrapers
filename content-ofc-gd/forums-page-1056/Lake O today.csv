Well...  PB lake trout for me yesterday,  And today, PB brown trout. (man I love lake O)  went 3 for 4 before it picked up with the east winds.  Here's a few pics before my camera batteries died.        Picture doen't do justice.  Thats a 3.5 ft salmon net. About 12-15 lbs    The release     The soft water season has begun!!!
