183235,LeXXington,2008-04-07 16:14:00,1928,"I love the OFC measeurement sticker for the front of the boat, Or the OFC stick on my tackle box, OFC hat, OFC flag ..  Wait, I am a boating billboard what about the sponsership money!!!"

183257,bigfish1965,2008-04-07 17:04:00,3382,I don't recall having to justify anything..to you or anyone else. The OFAH was quite glad to allow this.
183275,irishfield,2008-04-07 17:30:00,26272, You've gotta add 2008 to it Darren according to the new modified rules... Like has been mentioned above... we're getting toooo serious with this thing. OFC apparel was just fine the first round. You write 2008 on it this year... you gonna peel it off the boat next year?
