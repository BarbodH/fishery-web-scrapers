182377,Handlebarz,2008-04-05 20:43:00,3790,I was just wondering what you thought were with the gulp alive line of products?  I was thinking of getting a pint of minnows and leaches for my may 24 trip and if anyone knows how many do ya get in a pint? I asked a local store and they had no clue.
182378,kickingfrog,2008-04-05 20:58:00,8333,"I've used quite a few gulp products and like them. As I understand it the pails are meant to be used to ""re-charge"" the bait after some use. The stuff in the the zip-top bags is not supposed to be put back in the bag after use. I plan on getting a pail or two before walleye season."
182384,Stoty,2008-04-05 21:12:00,2910,"I was also thinking about getting some gulp leeches, but at $20+ per bucket, I hope they are worth it!! Too bad they didnt make smaller ""buckets""."
182390,chickenhawk,2008-04-05 21:19:00,612,i think they should work awesome!!! im gonna grab a pail before i head to Halley's
182392,kickingfrog,2008-04-05 21:22:00,8333,"  Ya, the $20 pail is the small one. The other size I've seen is twice as big for $30-$40 depending on where it is. CT has the small pails as would most quality tackle stores. I haven't seen the small pails for any less then about $19.99.  The small zip bags might be a better choice as someone experiments with the different types of gulp baits."
182393,Hotrod2066,2008-04-05 21:22:00,40,"I had to order the minnows in from the states and I still couldn't get leeches. You get about 50 in a bucket so it's alot cheaper than buying them by the bag. I like the liquid, the biggest complaint I had with gulp was  drying out and not lasting very long after you open the bag, the bucket solves those issues. However the buckets tend to leak, I heard they were going to address this issue but I don't know if they have yet."
182451,Handlebarz,2008-04-05 22:43:00,3790,one thing I did here from some others is tat they seem to last one guy sais he get 2 pickeral on most minnows and has even gotten 5 on one of them I had forgotten to ask how many were in from them so now I know around 50 thanks.  I have been looking for them in the states and they are still $19.99 so our local shops are doing good on this one for us as they are also $19.99 thats always a surprise and nice to see.   I have used the gulp bags before and like it but want to give this a try thanks for the help and hope some more people give there opinion on this.
182912,sonny,2008-04-06 23:25:00,511,"i got the minnows and the leeches,,,just waiting to try them out on my temagami trip....the one thing i really find differant about them is they don't stink like the old ones in the packets,,,,"
182924,danbouck,2008-04-06 23:34:00,4380,"I have heard of a lot of success with the minnows. As for me, last time on the ice I had the alive minnows on for a few hours and caught one perch. Decided to switch to live minnows and caught 7 perch and a pike in a half hour. All depends on the lake I think!"
182962,forrest,2008-04-07 00:34:00,1032,CTCs all but useless online shopping has the minnow shad listed as a product.   forrest PS...can you tell what I think of that site?
182963,mikethespike,2008-04-07 00:37:00,51,"i've purchased a pint bucket of the shrimp (from florida) for my trip to asia.  they come in 2 sizes;  a pint bucket contains 54 pcs. costs about $19.99-$24.00,  a quart bucket contains 108 pcs.  and costs around $38.00-$44.00.  hope this helps."
183199,Sherriff,2008-04-07 14:43:00,252,"I have both the minnows and the leeches.  Never caught anything on the minnows yet but I have not tried much and I have not used the leeches.  The leeches I have high hopes for on a few lakes I frequent during the summer.  As for leaking containers, I have had a terrible time with this.  The containers are brutal.  I switched to a thermos (that never leaked before) and it still leaked, everywhere.  I went to Walmart and bought a leak resistant container, yup, leaked.  Not sure what is in the stuff but keep the containers upright, the liquid makes a hell of a mess.....And it does smel ofter it has soaked into your tackle box....  Sherriff"
183260,Reef Runner,2008-04-07 17:10:00,981,"I got a packet of leaches at the sportsman show and got some high hopes for them for pickereyes this year. seen the bucket, but as I'm usually haulin' too much anyway I figured packets would be better.  reefrunner"
183266,MuddyWater,2008-04-07 17:19:00,218,way to expensive and they work just the same as a finS fish which are only 3.99 for like 20...
