182837,spoonman,2008-04-06 20:57:00,103,"I went to the Ringwood hatchery today, too help out the Metro East Anglers with some fish cleaning and feeding. We ended up visiting the Milne Fish Way Lift to do some rainbow lifting. It was a beautiful day for it and I learned a lot and had the chance to do some hands on helping. I would personally like to thank Andy Rubasek, Bruce Burt, Glenn Anderson and Melanie Tepp, for sharing some of there great knowledge. It was a lot of fun and I look forward to helping again in the near future.  Some pictures from today.  Chinook fry   Rainbow smolts   Salmon pen   Milne fish way lift   Glenn lifting up the “cage”   Rainbow Trout in cage, how many?   Each Rainbow hit the Scales   Quick Measurement   Micro Chip for Data   Glenn injecting chip   Great turn out today with some new faces and it was great too see the kids.   Glenn and Al with Rainbow   We ended up moving 48 Rainbow over the Milne Fish Way. Avg Size aprox 3.5kg  The club is dedicated to the improvement and conservation of our fisheries and environment throughout Ontario. The MEA encourages you to get involved and help us make the outdoors a little better for everyone.  For more information about Ringwood hatchery or Metro East Anglers you can visit the website at www.metroeastanglers.com  They are going to need a lot of help in the next few weeks if anyone can volunteer some time, it would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers Al"
