183017,Minnow,2008-04-07 02:10:00,177,Was hoping to get out for some steelhead on the Niagara River and was wondering how the conditions are on the river? Have never fished for steelhead on the Lower Niagara in the Spring and was wondering if anyone could help me out on what the best method would be to catch them right now? Any help is really appreciated!

The Glen area and whirlpool area is good for float fishing.  Bring2-4 pound lead for the Glen...water is uper clear right now.  Get there before the ice boom is taken out, once that happens river will be shot for a week or so."
