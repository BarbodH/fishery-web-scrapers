182800,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-06 19:32:00,1183,"Ever since your post about your ATV...it's like a hunting mission.  I still have my eyes open for ya.  Saw one the other day but it was red.  Glad to see that you got today, and got yourself a phish.  Lots of junk floating in the Castor River too...and the river is flowing fast."
