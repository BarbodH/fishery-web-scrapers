182085,bigfish1965,2008-04-05 02:31:00,3382,"I was out TV shopping the other day and was BLOWN AWAY by the Samsung LCD...no motion blur and an amazing picture. It had a much better pic than the others that cost way more. I beleive there is a law in the US that ALL TV stations must go digital/HD by the end of this year. And yes, Bell sucks monkey butts. Get Cogeco if you can."
