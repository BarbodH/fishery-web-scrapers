182194,mepps,2008-04-05 12:09:00,1301,snakehead!
182213,fishing n autograph,2008-04-05 13:16:00,2540,the result of an incestuous relationship...oh wait u said utah not arkansas
182242,forrest,2008-04-05 14:37:00,1032,As this or other reports said:  'The fishes flattened appearance may be due to being run over in the parking lot several times.'   forrest
182246,steverowbotham,2008-04-05 14:44:00,1800,definitely NOT a lake trout lol
182261,Abberz,2008-04-05 15:19:00,140, haha beat me to that one. If lakers looked like that I wouldn't go fishing for them or maybe even swimming for that matter!
182270,walleyejigger,2008-04-05 15:42:00,876,my guess is  Uglius Fishius
182317,Jigger,2008-04-05 18:31:00,1237,going with Mepps on this one. Looks like a Snakehead at first glance. They can live out of the water and actually travel over land. That would explain the run over on the road look.
182320,mepps,2008-04-05 18:41:00,1301,"if it didnt 'walk' onto land, it may have been dropped by a bird."
182326,Greencoachdog,2008-04-05 18:46:00,8163,"I agree with Clive... and it's in such good condition!!! Not only does it look like it's been run over, it also looks like it's been ""sunbathing"" for a couple weeks!"
182370,HTHM,2008-04-05 20:27:00,4082,It is very simple......it is a DEAD fish
182750,tjsa,2008-04-06 17:12:00,1578,"I would think it is something someone owned, and got rid of."
183311,RHYBAK,2008-04-07 18:26:00,21,Looks like an offspring from the Toilet creature from the X-Files.
183344,Casey123,2008-04-07 19:51:00,461,"Lake Trout Eh?  You can tell that the dumb ass with that part of the report def., does 0 fishing.  LOL"
