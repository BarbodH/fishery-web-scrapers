182566,Wendel,2008-04-06 02:34:00,213," Thanks it all came down to price really, got an almost completely outfitted used boat for a little less money. I still loved the look and the features of the Trackers though, I was at BPS today checking them out, the Targa's are really nice, but out of my price range.  Can't wait to get the new to me boat home   Pictures to follow!!!"
182580,Muskieman,2008-04-06 03:17:00,2472,I've had my Tracker V-14 T Super Guide now for 6 yrs and have had no problems whatsoever..  I beat the crap out of it..
182587,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-06 03:43:00,4399,  Thats because it has rivets!LOL
182628,danbouck,2008-04-06 12:25:00,4380,My tinny is riveted. It's leaks A LOT
182636,Radnine,2008-04-06 13:25:00,1538,"There are two kinds of riveted boats: Those that leak and those that are going to leak (sorry, I really do hate pissing contests, but I couldn't resist  )"
182642,irishfield,2008-04-06 13:43:00,26272," Nothing that can't be fixed in an hour or two Dan !   Quite possible.. but if done right they shouldn't. My airplane floats have 13,500 +/-100 rivets in them and don't leak a drop. I hit the water faster than anybody heres fishin boat goes.  That said.. what ever boat fits your budget/layout wants/style/colour/etc.. I wouldn't let welded vs riveted slow you down, but remember like anything in life you get what you pay for.  Wendel.. you're gonna enjoy that boat!"
182663,Maverick,2008-04-06 14:03:00,371,"We had a gruman a while back. I've never had such bad luck. The guy who had it before us screwed the floor to the ribs and the ribs cracked. so we took out the floor and had them welded. The boat lasted for a good7 or 8 years until this one tournament. We were making the run to the weigh in, not even big waves and one of the ribs tore a hole in the bottom of the boat about an inch wide and 3 inches long. Water was pissing through the hole so high that half of it went out of the boat. So we got that fixed and welded up and it was running nice, new starter on the motor. Entered in a tournament. We were doing alright but the river was a little rough, the Ottawa river so nothing crazy. Making the run across the river we hit a wave and me and my buddy felt our legs move up, we looked down and the boat was no longer a ""V"" hull in the middle. The beam snapped in half like a twig. We looked at each other and had a few choice words about our situation. Luckily the boat wasn't sinking or anything. Water was barely coming in and we had a good bilge pump. We stood up and the boat went back to the ""V"" form and putted across the river. We fished near the weigh in for the rest of the day and didn't catch a fish. As for Day 2 of the tournament, well for us Day 2 was spent drinking beer and cursing haha. Luckily we still haven't gotten rid of it as the price of aluminum is on the rise!  Not trying to bash gruman or anything, we have a really nice canoe of theirs, but just a horror story. Enjoy the new boat!"
182704,Radnine,2008-04-06 15:40:00,1538," Hey Irish, do you still have to ""slosh"" floats (is that the correct term?) I got roped into it one time at the airport when I was a kid. I remember the fumes being brutal and thinking ""this can't be good for me"". And this was long before WHMIS."
182778,irishfield,2008-04-06 18:27:00,26272,"I absolutely refuse to use sloshing compounds in floats or wet wing fuel tanks for that matter. Either build/fix them right the first time or find a new occupation. Sloshing compound will ALWAYS come back to bite you in the   Advise your students to never.. and I mean never.. use sloshing compound as an ""out"" to doing the job right the first time. Do not under any circumstances follow some kit builders suggestions of sloshing your fuel tanks after using proseal/seal pac/chem pac/ sealing compounds. If you use the sealers correctly, when building, you won't have leaks. Throwing slosh on top of it is a disaster waiting to happen... when it peels off in a sheet and smothers your fuel outlet screen. Things get really quiet after that... well other than your passenger screaming that is...."
182782,Greencoachdog,2008-04-06 18:36:00,8163,My Tracker Pro Deep V 17 is riveted and has leaked a drop in the 10+ years I've had it!!!
182807,Radnine,2008-04-06 19:49:00,1538,"Maybe that’s why they weld those boats now, built in obsolescence."
182809,irishfield,2008-04-06 19:55:00,26272,I think Glen meant to say.. HASN'T leaked a drop since new.  As for welding... like I said earlier buy what YOU want and fits your target...but I'd hate to tell you how many welded aluminum fuel tanks that I've repaired by prosealing all the welds.. as fuel seeps thru the porisity (probably not a word..) of the welds. Not as much an issue with water thanks to surface tension of the fluid.  Personally I'd only buy a welded hull if the material thickness was at least 20% thicker than a similar size/load capacity riveted hull.
182814,danbouck,2008-04-06 20:05:00,4380, Ya but i'm not to concerned about it. I just throw in a little battery and a bilge pump and don't think about it.
182816,irishfield,2008-04-06 20:10:00,26272,"Well if you're up this way, with it, before I head North... we can reset the rivets if you want...and look for any cracks."
182819,Greencoachdog,2008-04-06 20:13:00,8163," Can you get to the drain plug from the inside? If so, just pull it while traveling under speed and all the water will drain out. Replace the plug before you stop."
182822,danbouck,2008-04-06 20:22:00,4380," I may take you up on that if i'm up there!   Ya I can get to it from the inside and I do ocaasionally pull it out at a good speed, but usually this boat it for small electric motor only lakes."
182825,irishfield,2008-04-06 20:27:00,26272, Well ya got 32 days to do so!   .. or in the late fall.
182827,danbouck,2008-04-06 20:30:00,4380, I guess it's fall then lol I wanna get up to lake T again this year!
182829,irishfield,2008-04-06 20:35:00,26272,Well if you do.. be sure to drop in.. make time for fishing. I'm right across from the PPark.. so handy!
182873,Billy Bob,2008-04-06 22:46:00,5865,"I have a 16' 4"" side console Grumman with a 84"" beam powered by a 50 hp VRO Johnson outboard since it was new in 1885. I ordered it with a windshield (driver only) and a HUGE rod locker. I had a buddy once say my rod locker could hold a body if need be  It also has a nice big 22 gallon live well that doubles as a ice chest when fishing deep walleye that wouldn't keep in a live well.  This year I replace the electric trolling motor and just installed a Lowrance LMS 520 this past week and that is about all that has ever needed to be done on my fishing machine. She has seen LOTS of big rough water fishing walleye tournaments in Lake Erie and salmon fishing in Lake Ontario.  She's rigged and hooked up to my truck as I peck away here and I will be enjoying my 23rd straight year on this beloved boat tomorrow at Honeoye Lake. When I ordered I knew I would have it for a long time because it fills all my needs as a fishing boat. I can tow it ANYWHERE and fish the smallest lakes to any of the Great Lakes in comfort and safety. So when it's time to purchase a new boat take your time and do it right for what you want the boat to do.  Bob"
182875,irishfield,2008-04-06 22:49:00,26272,Man Bob.. I would have never suspected you were quite that old....
182883,Billy Bob,2008-04-06 23:05:00,5865," LOL,  I guess I am (53) to most of you whipper snappers here  Old but very experience so I guess that's not all bad. But I will say I do take it a little easier now and no longer fish tournaments but rather fish for enjoyment only. You will one day too  Here's one good thing I got going for myself, I am RETIRED and have lots of time to fish especially during the week when there's a lot less pressure.  Gone Fishing, Old Bob"
182896,irishfield,2008-04-06 23:14:00,26272,Dang.. but you bought that boat a 123 years ago...  I fish when ever I want as well... have for many years.
182904,Mike the Pike,2008-04-06 23:18:00,3421, So Bob what does an 1885 Tracker look like is it steam powered or did it come with a Ford model T inboard I stroke is it wood or the Hucleberryfin model  lol  
181770,Andy,2008-04-04 19:36:00,330,"I don't know if the Smokercraft line of boats appeals to you, but I enjoyed dealing with Can-Do Sports  just south of Woodstock. It would likely be a short drive for you to the dealership, so what have you got to lose? There is a Sylvan dealer in New Hamburg that I've spoken to, but never dealt with. (Sylvan is to Smokercraft what Mercury is to Ford) There is also a Legend dealer in New Hamburg that a friend of mine bought  a Princecraft from a number of years ago. He's now looking at a new boat and is not going back to this dealer. (I don't think they even handle Princecraft anymore) My friend has done a lot of looking around and is hoping to get a Lund. I have bought parts in the past from Hully Gully without problems, but found some of their pricing a little high.  Have fun and good luck. Andy"
181792,walleyemen,2008-04-04 20:07:00,316,"LOL tracker has lifetime aswell, if this problem was as serious as people make it out to be i don,t think they'd offer lifetime on the hull.Also no one know's what leads up to these cracks as well, maybe not telling the whole story!!!Sometimes care and common sense are do.I,ve seen some pretty bad boaters in my time and guyz with new boats to boot, i watched a guy back in a dock once in a new crestliner and trashed the trnsome, his reply was oh well it's warrantied!! LOL"
181800,mbac31,2008-04-04 20:18:00,904,I have the bass version of the Tracker Walleye boat. The Tracker Avalanche DC. Best one I have owned so far. I have had a few. Warranty is very good. The new manager at Tracker Marine in Vaughan is a real nice guy. I love this boat cause its a little larger and higher that the normal bass boat and handles big water very well.
181917,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-04 22:51:00,4399,  It all comes down to personal preference after the research I did I decided a riveted hull was the best choice for me. For me I would not like the idea of having to ship my boat back to manufacturer to fix a cracked weld and be without a boat for months and also worry about the repair failing again which I think would be a high probabilty. With regards to lifetime warranties I would suggest reading the fine print as some manufactures only honor the warranty for the original purchaser and some only on certain components.
182376,Maverick,2008-04-05 20:43:00,371,Does anybody know anything about Fisher Boats? Was just checkin them out online. They looked alright.
182489,Radnine,2008-04-05 23:50:00,1538,"After reading this thread it is painfully clear that every welded hull will crack and have to be sent back to the factory, and there has never been a problem with any riveted boat. One wonders why a 60 year old company like Crestliner even bothers."
182500,bassboy,2008-04-06 00:36:00,161," Fisher is owned by Tracker  Maverick.  Tracker bought Fisher a few years ago, because of their welding technology (or so I was told by my dealer). If you compare some of the Tracker and Fisher models side by side they are identical (or at  least they were last year) other that the colours.....I looked at both when I bought mine.   Bill"
182539,Wendel,2008-04-06 01:43:00,213,"I ended up going with a PolarKraft, thanks for all the advice!!!"
182562,eye-tracker,2008-04-06 02:20:00,89,"   I think I understand your pain - I have owned many welded boats with out a single crack or failed weld. I have also owned riveted boats and only ever had one that popped about ten rivets because I had to make a run in 8 footers when I was caught on Lake Erie in bad weather. Welded, Fiberglass, Riveted - I don't care how they are made. If you beat them up they break. I did not see a single post on this thread where an owner said they had welds fail. I did notice lots of posts of someone knew someone or a friend of someone that had a weld let go. So it only seems that boats owned by friends or other people have problems with the weld.  Wendel enjoy your PolarKraft, they make a very nice boat.  -sheldon"
181119,Rich Clemens,2008-04-03 23:00:00,3131,"I am on my second Tracker boat.  The first boat I ever owned, we purchased about 5 years ago and it was the Pro Angler.   It came with a 25 hp Merc, but we had it upgraded to a 40.    We picked it up at a sports show in Harrisburg, PA as the price was right for us and we got a pretty good deal.   Never had a bit of problem with it and we liked the way the storage areas.   I think it was a 16' with a 72"" beam.  This had the dual console.   We wanted a bit more room and with fishing Ontario in late September, we could get into some chilly/wet weather running down the river.   Of course, a Little console for my wife, just wasn't doing the job.   Patsy even suggested we check out the boats that have a full windshield.  Hmmmm ... A bigger boat.  Let me think about that for a fraction of a second.  Ok.   Bass Pro had their grand opening in Harrisburg a few years back and they partner with Tracker.  We really liked the tracker we had and worked with the sales rep on a trade with the grand-opening specials they were running.  They had a TARGA V17 WT on site and looked it over pretty good.   We liked the available open space and the multiple areas of storage.  It came with a 75, but knew we wanted to upgrade to a 90, which wasn't all that much more money.  What I didn't like was that they were only offering me 4K on my Pro Angler and I knew it was worth more than that.  Other than a few scratches, the boat was is great condition as we keep it in our garage.  After considering it for a while, we decided to go ahead and make the deal.  We really enjoy the boat and are happy with it.  The only thing I wish I had done differently was to upgrade to the 90 4-Stroke, instead of the 2-stroke I have.    If you're considering the boat, get it prepped the way you want it ... up front.  Otherwise you'll just be coming back later on and upgrading things.   So far, I'm not yet permitted to upgrade the motor.  (Still working on that one).  Overall we are very pleased with the trackers and are within our price range for the boat we wanted.   Of course, it seems that they don't hold their value at trade-in time like others do.  As I mentioned before, we've hada no problems with either boat from the day we bought them.    Of course, with a 30 gallon tank - it is starting to hurt a bit when pulling in the gas station.  Our ride and our two regular fishing buddies.   (Sadly I had to put the Airedale down a little over a month ago, be we have another to break in this year).  "
181129,Dartee,2008-04-03 23:21:00,47,Wendel If you are not in a hurry and can wait till November  eye-tracker (Sheldon Hatch) is selling his rig.  http://www.fish-hawk.net/hawktalk/viewtopic.php?t=28586  Its a very nice walleye rig
181152,eye-tracker,2008-04-03 23:46:00,89,"I have just purchased my 5th Tracker boat and over the years only had a few minor problems, as all boats do. My local dealer and Tracker Boats fixed the problem quickly with no questions asked. I can personally afford to purchase any boat on the market, but I choose Trackers because of the layout and fishability of the boats. I joined the Tracker Pro-Staff last year because I believe in their product - I asked them,  they did not approach me. When fishing walleye tournaments I have seen every boat manufactured have hull, transom and structure problems to the point of complete failure. If you push a boat hard it will break no matter how it is made!  Take care of your Tracker and it will take care of you for many years of fishing and family fun.  Visit the Tracker Boats website and enter your postal code -  build your boat, print out the price and take it to the dealer. No Haggle no Hassle Pricing as tracker sets pricing at head office.  Happy boating this season...  -sheldon"
181158,Pigeontroller,2008-04-03 23:50:00,2793,"I know alot of guys here like their Trackers, but I wouldn't touch one based on everything I've heard. More than a few horror stories...And I know a guy who used to run a Marina than stopped dealing them, they would come in missing screws, bolts,etc.  I highly recomend Doug and Clarence at BAY CITY MARINE in Hamilton."
181172,eye-tracker,2008-04-04 00:05:00,89,"All boats that have screws and bolts will have them come loose during travel and on the water. A good dealer will make sure all of this stuff is tighten with marine sealant when they service the boat. My dealer has a checklist that they go over for all the boats that come in the shop and loose bolts and screws on boats and trailers is one of the many things they check.  Lots of great boats on the market and I will not talk negative of any other manufacturer, but as I mentioned earlier I have seen them all have their problems over the years.  Fish On,  -sheldon"
181235,bassboy,2008-04-04 01:07:00,161,"Wendel:  Here is mine :  2007 Super Guide V16SC W/ Merc 50hp ELPTO  I have owned it for less than a year (got it in June of last year), and with it being my first boat I have nothing to compare it to. I think we got a good deal on it, and after looking at others it seemed to suit our needs better for the money we wanted to spend.  It was bought from Boatland Canada, who seem to be a good bunch. They treated us reasonably well so I have no room to complain there either. Had it in for a warranty issue (Motor only.....nothing to do with the boat) and they seemed to be ok in that regard as well.  It got used on the Kawarthas last year and a couple of times on Simcoe as well.  Overall so far I am pleased with it.   I do know that Tracker Marine recently bought Fisher boats for, or so I am told, their welding technology so I would assume that some of the quality issues of the past that people mention would be fixed, but cant say for sure until something happens.   Sorry I cant help much more, other than to say we are happy with ours.  Good luck!!  Bill"
181251,Radnine,2008-04-04 01:28:00,1538,"I pick my new boat up on Wednesday. I bought at Proctor Marine in Simcoe, and have been thrilled with the experience so far. I have not owned a boat before and did loads of research (as you are starting to do now). It is a shame that you missed the boat show (I assume) because there is nothing like being able to hop from boat to boat and making direct comparisons. I found that all of the boats, within the same length and price range, were pretty comparable side to side and it is the little things that come from sitting in them that sway you. I also think that you can’t go too far wrong by sticking with a “major” brand, with history and staying power (Crestliner, Lund, Alumacraft, etc.). Good luck!"
181264,danbouck,2008-04-04 01:39:00,4380,My buddy bought a new tracker 12' john boat last year and the welds were horrible. I'm not sure about the bigger boats though.
181279,bpsbassman,2008-04-04 01:57:00,941,"I've had two Trackers: One identical to Tracker's (99 Tracker Pro v-16 with a 60hp 2 stroke).    It was a great boat,  I did have a problem with the rivets though (which Irishfield fixed for me).  This is my new boat 2006 Pro Guide V-16 with a 75 4 stroke.    Its been a great boat so far and I wouldn't hesitate to get another.  Here's the difference in the depth of the two and how much wider they've gotten.    Talk to Pavo, the Manager at Tracker at Bass Pro in Vaughn.  He is a great guy and will really take care of you. Their service and staff has been exceptional (I realize I'm a little biased, but it has been a real positive experience).  Good Luck!"
