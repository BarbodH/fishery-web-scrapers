177501,Scott S,2008-03-27 17:15:00,203,"Where is the best place to launch your boat up there, when the derby is on. I would like to go in the derby but have never fished there before. Thanks Scooter"
177502,irishfield,2008-03-27 17:20:00,26272,Might wanna take an auger this year...
177503,richyb,2008-03-27 17:20:00,774,Hey scooter  do you trailor your boat?  i know you can launch at the orillia park and also across the road from tudhope park on the simcoe side ... I do know that the launches are a mad house so i just take the 12 footer and throw it in my truck so i can put it in anywhere..
177516,Stoty,2008-03-27 17:52:00,2910, I was just going to say that!!! hahaha
177527,Terry,2008-03-27 18:28:00,14456,nae..the narrows will be open a week this coming Monday
177531,Hookset,2008-03-27 18:35:00,367, damn straight !!! the power of positive thinking.  It's definitely a hoot. Usually my first soft water trip of the season. If anyone wants to go just PM me. I usually head out a couple times a week til it's over.   Hookset.
177534,Stoty,2008-03-27 18:42:00,2910,"Hookset,  I just might take you up on that offer for 2 reasons:  1) I have no clue where to go up there! 2) My boat wont be ready until the end of April!  I wouldnt mind hooking into the $5,000 fish. That would be alright eh!"
177548,Hookset,2008-03-27 19:13:00,367,"Hey, I look forward to it Stoty,  PM or call me and we'll hook up. P.S. - we smoked them last year using tiny power tubes under a slip float about a foot off bottom. Don't tell nobody.   Hookset."
177557,LeXXington,2008-03-27 19:30:00,1928," LOL, they may be open but putting you boat in the water to get there could pose a slight problem"
177591,irishfield,2008-03-27 20:59:00,26272,I couldn't see anything driving across the bridge Tuesday evening... like Lexx says it's probably open... but there's ice anywhere you'd be able to launch.. unless Gord will let you put in at his houseboat ops.
177926,rtrudeau,2008-03-28 13:43:00,57,"I was there on Tuesday. Just around the bridges and about 100 yards on Simcoe side is open. Still 2 feet of ice just out from there on couch side and 3 feet of ice on the bay out from the beach at tudhope park. If anyone has kids, the kids day as mentioned is well worth bringing the little ones to. My boys have been a couple a few years now and they treat the kids well. Every kid gets a present (from fishing rods to cases of pop) and the kid even get hot dogs anf a drink. Lots of fun. I will be there so if you come look for the OFC hat. Ryan"
177983,marcers75,2008-03-28 15:24:00,36,I'll be there for sure. Have a boat reserved for April 20 and May 3rd. Launching from Blue Beacon Marina. I hope the ice is gone by then as its my first time going and don't know where i can fish from shore.  Hope to see yu guys up there.
177985,Terry,2008-03-28 15:29:00,14456,hey my folding boat I just  walk it to the open water and fish.....if I put wheels on it and a top i COULD CALL IT A WILLYCRAFT......oops wrong board I wasn't thinking about everyone else...  but I think at lest one marina will have open water you might need to pay to launch but what the heck
177986,irishfield,2008-03-28 15:31:00,26272,Hey Terry.. to pass China's coast guard laws they drop it weighted from a good height. I'm sure a couple of us could help you off the narrows bridge. Any idea on height so I can compare it to specs?
177987,tinbanger,2008-03-28 15:36:00,1028,"Been going for last 7 or so years and always been able to launch and suspect this year will be no different. Narrows are open all year due to the current just gettin to it is the issue right now . Once year fished in heavy fog with lots of loose ice around ,sounded like a million wind chimes !  May take a pass this year kinda tired of crush of boats at the launches .Or maybe launch at Tiffen and go for a cruise  tb"
177999,Terry,2008-03-28 15:49:00,14456,do I need to be in it when it is dropped?  and do I get to have a bungee cord on me
178000,irishfield,2008-03-28 15:49:00,26272, Yes... wouldn't be any fun otherwise  ..and NO.
178003,Terry,2008-03-28 15:51:00,14456,"dang.........you first, I was always more of a follower....LOL"
178006,tinbanger,2008-03-28 15:52:00,1028,Cmon give Terry a Bungee otherwise he might fall out
178007,irishfield,2008-03-28 15:55:00,26272,You know it's one thing I've never done... the perch derby.. and I live so close. Then again I never ice fished up until the winter of 2006.. so who knows!
178021,Casey123,2008-03-28 16:20:00,461,I would probably be looking for a sled launch not a boat launch.
