182212,Mike01,2008-04-05 13:12:00,378,"Living in North Bay, I fish Lake Nipissing a lot.  This lake is loaded with sheapshead.  We get them mostly on a jig and worm dragging the bottom.  I have never caught one on a lure and I'm not sure why?"
182214,kickingfrog,2008-04-05 13:26:00,8333, They're not pretty enough and many of us are snobs.
182217,Golfisher,2008-04-05 13:34:00,586,"Sure they aren't about to win any beauty contest, but they don't look that much uglier than fat largies.  There must be another reason.  Are they smelly?"
182226,jil101ca,2008-04-05 14:03:00,41,"Whatever you do , DO NOT wrapped said sheephead in foil and place on BBQ.  YUCK YUCK YUCK"
182404,chickenhawk,2008-04-05 21:32:00,612,with my experience with sh!theads i find that once you get them into the boat they sh!t all over the place and they are slimy and ugly so thats why i dont like to catch them....  Hawk

183216,gforce,2008-04-07 15:06:00,63,"Thanks all. Yes, targeting this species is weird, but, for a rookie looking for action ( a friend new to fishing ) a few tips is a good thing!  I have caught them on cleos on consectuive casts, so, I think they school and work the bottom."
183217,LeXXington,2008-04-07 15:14:00,1928,"Sheepies are always great fun,  Easy way to catch them is target anyting but them.  I caught one of Bronte downrigging at 50 feet.. Now that was weird."
183219,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-07 15:20:00,2050,"Hey if you're sport fishing I say there's nothing wrong with targeting this species!  A big sheepie will out-fight any smallie I've caught on the hookset, but they're usually pooched after a couple of good runs.  Once you get them in the boat you've got to be speedy because they'll go belly up quicker than any bass I've caught.  Also, they're no uglier than a carp, and a little more exciting to fish for if you prefer casting to sitting!"
183227,Headhunter,2008-04-07 15:46:00,5703,"There are only two things more disgusting than having a Sheep Head aka ""water goat"" on your line... having one in your boat and passing one rotting on the surface of the water as your trolling by HH"
181380,gforce,2008-04-04 04:44:00,63,what is the best setup for this fish?
181388,gforce,2008-04-04 05:08:00,63,jig & worm?  floating? sinkin'?
181390,PickerelHunter,2008-04-04 05:15:00,100,"Don't know what the best thing to use is, but I've caught my fair share while bass fishing with inline spinners"
181393,chickenhawk,2008-04-04 05:43:00,612,tie a roller skate to the end of your line.....should manage a couple s***heads lol......i imagine just about any old dew worm sitting on bottom would work just fine
181404,jonnybass,2008-04-04 07:42:00,346,I get them on cleos when I'm casting for salmon.
181421,OhioFisherman,2008-04-04 11:10:00,6623,"Anything a smallie will eat with the exception of surface lures, never got one on a surface lure and their mouths don`t have a good location for surface feeding. Tubes work, jig and pigs, crankbaits, just about any live bait. Ball head jig with a piece of worm, just about anything. They also love crawfish.  Don`t know if they actually school, but I have caught more than I wanted in certain areas. They seem to prefer the same types of bottom as smallies, rocky bottoms, rip rap along causeways and bridges, current doesn`t bother them too much but an eddy or any current break is a better spot to try.  They get pretty good size, up to around 20 pounds, sort of a bull dog fighter, down and deep."
181423,Marko,2008-04-04 11:18:00,854,Sinker + hook + worms or minnows should do the trick.
181433,Rich,2008-04-04 11:43:00,3927,Worm on bottom.
181464,natemr2,2008-04-04 12:33:00,21,"I think they will take just about anything, but the big boys seem to have a liking for orange, we have caught them on salmon gear out in 100 ft of water and then at the river mouth in the same day, for shore fishing I have unfortuatly got quite a few while fishing for wallys with minnows."
181480,kickingfrog,2008-04-04 13:11:00,8333,"Lake Nippising is the only place I have caught them. Typically it's when we're fishing for walleye in the spring/ early summer. I can't remember a time when we've got them on a minnow, it's either worm/jig, worm/crawler harness or jig/grub. That might also say something about which presentations we use in the areas that the drum are in at that time of year on Nippissing. One year it was the guy using a blue crawler harness that was the only one catching 'em, another year it was orange. Most other years though, colour didn't seem to make as much of a difference. For what that's worth? That's for someone else to decide.  Lots of fun on the walleye gear."
181483,Headhunter,2008-04-04 13:17:00,5703,"I'd ask Terry! LOL! Well, unfortunately, I've caught them on just about everything when trolling... from my expereince, if you really really want to catch a big one, I'd put on any crank bait you like, trolling and in my mind picture a 32 inch Pickereye attaching it... that should pretty much guarantee you hooking a big old ""Water Goat""! Someone  lookin to make some soup?! HH"
181484,Ramble,2008-04-04 13:20:00,713,I've caught them on mosty orange or yellow worm harnesses.  -R
181486,irishfield,2008-04-04 13:21:00,26272,Bomber A at 1.4MPH..    Man.. he sure looks happy !
181490,Headhunter,2008-04-04 13:26:00,5703,LOL Wayne! I knew I should have taken that Bomber away from him two years ago! HH
181492,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-04 13:28:00,2050,"1) Small silver (Orland) inline spinner 2) Silver xrap - slowly cranked back rather than slashing it 3) Live Shiner under a float.  The live shiner works best, but the problem with that is sometimes they get hooked deep and as I'm assuming you aren't keeping them you'll want to at least pinch  the barb.  Cheers, UF"
181511,pikehunter,2008-04-04 14:02:00,1659,"Go walleye fishing...   Or go bass fishing, like in this picture.   Never targeted them but somedays I just can't keep them off the hook and they help to fill in an otherwise unproductive day."
181695,Billy Bob,2008-04-04 17:45:00,5865,"I NEVER heard of anyone ever wanting to target them. This is a new one for me, however we have all caught more of these fish then we ever want to admit  Fishing Lake Erie for walleye we catch our fair share of sheephead better know here as shitheads, sewer trout, galvanized pike, Buffalo fish and a few other crazy names I have heard them referred to over the years. One thing I know is if you do catch quite of few more than anyone else on the boat that day you will be called the ""King Sheppard"" for a while  BTW you can't go wrong with worms on anything."

181943,ccmtcanada,2008-04-04 23:38:00,7971,Caught this guy with a small spinner bait casting from shore....a Jumla to be exact....  
181957,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-04 23:58:00,2585,i got into a school of 2 pound smallies last summer on nipissing and then WHAM big hit and big fight!  I thought i had a 6 or 7 pound smallie on.  that was until the sheaphead surfaced and i wanted to cry.  great fight though  cheers!
182117,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-05 03:00:00,33," Worms will work every time. Sh**heads are absolutely psycho when you hook up on them. I've caught them by happenstance while fishing for bass and 'eyes in the West Arm.  OTOH I tried cooking one up using a recipe that a fishing lodge owner swore by. What a disappointment. My kitchen stank like Hell and I couldn't feed pigs with it, let alone my cat. Blechhh!  I did recover the otoliths from inside the head. They have an interesting-looking marking that looks like the letter ""L""."
182184,pikehunter,2008-04-05 10:58:00,1659," My Grandfather used to say they had a stone for a brain.  Of course no, but that was what he claimed after cutting ones head open. This is from a guy that ate fried goats brains  He was a character."
182190,Terry,2008-04-05 11:44:00,14456,well it was not a bomber that's my secret  sheephead lure but Joe did tell me to get rid of it and use real walleye lures   
182206,Golfisher,2008-04-05 12:38:00,586,"If it fights so sell as everyone seems to agree, and you are fishing for the sport of it rather than for fish fries (as when you are targetting big largies in a hot summer day), why all this disdain for sheephead?  Just curious, as I've never caught one."
