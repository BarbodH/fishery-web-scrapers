182776,Terry,2008-04-06 18:20:00,14456,DAMN DIRTY APES  he was a star

182976,Nanook,2008-04-07 00:58:00,565,"One of the best 'Character' actors. Still enjoy the re-runs. No-one to match him nowadays,"
182985,oxcowboy,2008-04-07 01:19:00,544,"whether you agree with his stand on things or not most would agree he was one of the greatest actors of all time.  i think his greatest line was delivered to president clinton when he said ""America doesn't trust you with our 21-year-old daughters, and we sure, Lord, don't trust you with our guns.""   jason"

183131,Greencoachdog,2008-04-07 11:39:00,8163,The Omega man has finally bit the dust. (That has got to be the worst movie ever!)
183211,bigbuck,2008-04-07 14:59:00,2449,"Yup, too bad, he was one heck of an actor. I was watching something over the weekend about Michael Moore's movie and Charton Heston being misquoted and set up. That guy is a jerk!! Before anyone starts on the gun policies of the U.S., remember a bit about their history, if some people did not have guns back in the 1700's, there would not be a US of A."
183220,Headhunter,2008-04-07 15:26:00,5703,"I wonder if they are making him into ""Soylent Green"" ! It's people! It's people! LOL! http://www.soylent-green.com/ HH"
