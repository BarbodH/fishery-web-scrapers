178680,brickNblock,2008-03-30 00:37:00,598,"Well, We've been looking and looking. Having lost our boat some years back and then selling our last tinny to a member here about 3 years back we clawed our way back up..... Last year we got ourselves another tinny......(We are keeping it) Today we picked up our final boat...I think...Love it anyway.  PrinceCraft SuperPro 176...w/princecraft trailer. 2001 - 115 Johson ELPTO 2003 - LongShaft 76lb w/ PT..MinnKota w/ m.k OnBoard 2 bank charger. Custom travel/engine covers Stand up top w/side and back'rear curtains 3 batteries Lowrance sonars/temp/speed. It's loaded w/other great stuff.........  Anyhoo....it's paid for in full and sitting in the driveway right now. Insured for replacement value....(Boat/Motor/Trailer/Trolling Motor and accessories) CAA gold + w/RV. We're covered..unless someone pipes in with additional coverage we should have. Wont be doing as much 'lunge' action this year as hoped but have prety much concentrated on the walleye population of where we live for this year as a starter.  Ive added 'DAWGS"" boat launching etiqette to 'MyFavourites"" on the desktop here and figure were good to go.  Look for us out on the Bay of Quinte....Daily, 2008  bNb"

Its only had break-in hours on it since it was rebuilt....(2007) All new: Pistions /Ring kits. Fuel Pump and lmtr Water Pump Cylinder sleeve Shaft AY: Propeller Gearset 13:26 Shifter..much, much more....$6219 in repairs. Basically the motor is brand new and reading on the paperwork rated closer to 130hp. I dont know....Its what it says..either way Im happy with the way it purred when it was fired up.  As for pics.....Your right guys.  Charmaine has plans to scrub'er down later today. Ill get pics then......too long a drive yesterday. Thanks for everyones congrats. bNb  Fishnsled was witness to my lack of backing up qualities last year and I was dreading doing just that when I got home.  Well, I got stuck in a small town intersection in Washago and had to turn the rig around early..... Wow.heart pounding...traffic being held up...what a surprise....I did it first shot just as explained so often by Dawg. The only diff was the ""...the clouds never opened up with the sun shining right on me and singing angels above stuff""..lol"
