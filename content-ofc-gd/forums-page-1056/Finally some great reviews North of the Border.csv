182941,mbac31,2008-04-06 23:51:00,904,I just read my April/May issue of In-Fishermen. Finally a awesome bait by one of our local guys gets some awesome reconigition. I have been using these for Smallies for a while and have had extreme success with them.  There is a picture of his hand poured baits next to the big guns baits. Personally I have used alot  of these  style baits and found Marks to be the best so far. Strike Zone Slammers and Goby.  I have been telling guys for over a year now that they are deadly on Walleye as well. Very nice picture of Dave Chong as well. Very Honorable mentions on both guys. Keep up the good work and I look forward to what you will come up with next. Hope you   guys break that 30 lb mark next year.
