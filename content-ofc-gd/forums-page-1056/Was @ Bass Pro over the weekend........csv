183183,irishfield,2008-04-07 14:10:00,26272,Note the two threads on BPS Montreal. One in news.. one in announcements.
183184,darsky,2008-04-07 14:15:00,586,thanks and you are quick there Irish
183186,darsky,2008-04-07 14:21:00,586,Was not Cabelas slated to open there under same circumstances. Looks like BPS took over the worksite.
183187,irishfield,2008-04-07 14:23:00,26272,I originally looked at the date of the announcement and thought it was maybe an April fools joke....
183208,wallyboss,2008-04-07 14:55:00,1095,"Cabela's backed out and BassPro are in,  supposedly!!!  I'll believe it when I am standing at the door at the Opening Day Sale Event."
183238,steverowbotham,2008-04-07 16:23:00,1800,"as an employee of bass pro shops, i can tell you that is is true!"
183240,wallyboss,2008-04-07 16:30:00,1095,Steve it's just that I had heard the same thing from somebody that worked at Cabela's.  I hope it's true.
183248,RHYBAK,2008-04-07 16:44:00,21,Cabela's doen't even show it on their map anymore as a future new store. Here's a link to a news report about Bass Pro going in.  http://www.fishingworld.com/News/Read.php?ArtID=000022284
183249,JohnAB,2008-04-07 16:46:00,178,"Everyone in Alberta I think is anxiously awaiting the opening of the Calgary BPS store here. Looks like a August, early fall opening. Cannot wait to go and check it out myself."
