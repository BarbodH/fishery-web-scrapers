In an effort to keep you informed, the definition for each is listed below...  GUTS - is arriving home late after a night out with the guys, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the guts to ask: ""Are you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?""  BALLS - is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the butt and having the balls to say: ""You're next.""  I hope this clears up any confusion on the definitions.  Medically speaking, there is no difference in the outcome since Both ultimately result in death"
