182576,Mike the Pike,2008-04-06 03:07:00,3421,"Wow absolute mind blowing report nice to see an amazing report as most of us are going through the transition report.  As usual Jen A nice read and you write so well.  Reminds me of the trip I took 2 years ago with my wife in Cuba wish I had of brought fishing gear.  The money you spent was well spent fishing adventures like that do not happen to often.  That is like winning the lottery of fishing.  Congrats on the fish fishmaster and Jen.  My Dad has a 7 foot 3 inch Sailfish (83lbs) on his wall at home caught in 1978 in Miami.  It took him 45 minutes to bring it in and my mom and Dad got sea sick but it was worth it.  Thanks for the awesome report.  Hope to see you Fred, and Sonny in Quinte May 3rd.    MTP"
