80927,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-07 22:04:00,4399,Has to be one of those genetically engineered hatchery fish.
80941,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-07 23:06:00,1351,what a monster..
80961,ilario,2007-06-08 00:06:00,166,that's huge...   looks like a hatchery fish on steroids...
80962,bucktail,2007-06-08 00:08:00,1857,"A triploid is a stocked fish that has been shocked with warm water sometime during the development period. This causes the fish to become sterile and devote all its energy into growth and not into reproduction. Landing this fish is a huge accomplishment but it still is an artificial ""engineered"" fish and really should not count as a record. If you force fed a fish in an aquarium would they count that. I really think the record books should address this."

81090,brkygetr,2007-06-08 03:25:00,425,"without question that is an amazing football of a fish, though I am no scientist but as per previous posts and my own initial observations that thing is and must have been stocked and fed well!!! I would love the chance to haul that thing in. In Lake O, E, and Huron they grow about as big as you can get them naturally, I also think the records should indicate the habitat of the fish. I've seen 8 lb pellet fed fish that would be no more than 3 lb jacks out of the Saugeen or the Niagara.  Brkygetr "
81149,douG,2007-06-08 11:44:00,2693,Sounds like it was caught out of Lake Diefenbaker in Saskatchewan.  Can you imagine breaking your own world record?
80748,HookNrelease,2007-06-07 15:07:00,85,"just recieved an e-mail from a friend who`s two brothers just broke their own and the world class record for a Rainbow trout right here in Canada, Im looking with my mout wide open at pictures of this beast, get this 34 inch girth, 38.75 inches long and weighed officially at 43.6 LBS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

80793,Kev,2007-06-07 16:33:00,54,WOW!!!!!!!        lots of nice fish on that site. The trout looks like it's about to bust!  Thx for showing us.
80794,ccmtcanada,2007-06-07 16:33:00,7971,Oh man...I'm speechless.  So as far as world record...is this an authenticated one and recognized?  I'm just curious...cause it would be great to have this official in nature!!!
80800,HookNrelease,2007-06-07 16:53:00,85,"the fish was caught June 5th, 2 days ago, and will be upto the IGFA to approve, they actually caught 30 plus pound fish going for the 8lb class record last year and were denied as when the IGFA tested the line it broke at 8.89lbs and the limit is 8.81lbs  , thats when they decided to spool 6lb so they would either make the 6lb or 8lb class range either way. they have been after these records for a number of years now, some true 26year old die hards"
80801,ccmtcanada,2007-06-07 16:55:00,7971, Wow...incredible story...incedible catch....THATS INCREDIBLE!!!  Hey wait....I just had great idea for a TV show....haha.
80816,mattyk,2007-06-07 17:19:00,2110,thats one crazy beast of a rainbow trout. Where was it caught?
80832,douG,2007-06-07 17:55:00,2693,"That site is blocked here.  Will anyone please host that picture somewhere else, like the photo gallery, and post it here, please?  Thanks."
80835,HookNrelease,2007-06-07 18:00:00,85,"Doug, I have a number of pictures that were taken tuesday night, as soon as the boys give permission ill post them right here.  cheers ian"

80842,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-07 18:17:00,1351,dude.. i can't wait to see!!!
80843,motv8tr,2007-06-07 18:24:00,2587,"Wow, that's a huge fish....I guess to get the record confirmed he had to keep that beauty instead of letting it go?  If he did, it's definitley worth mounting, if not, I sure hope it produces lots of healthy babies  .  Oh, and according to the site, the fish was caught in Saskatchewan if I read it correctly.  Maureen"
80865,bucktail,2007-06-07 19:42:00,1857,Another escapee triploid I assume by the looks of it. Looks like a carbon copy of the one that was caught in Ontario 2 years ago. the fat Albert of trout. Are triploids elidgable for record standings?
80866,solopaddler,2007-06-07 19:48:00,8605,My gawd what an ugly mutated slob of a fish!

80892,xrap,2007-06-07 20:27:00,683,TANK!!!!!!!!
80924,Jigger,2007-06-07 22:01:00,1237,"I don't think stocked fish should be allowed as record holders. Maybe with a * beside them.  Either way  , that fish defies nature.True Leviathan. Congrats to your buddies!"
80925,Tacklebuster,2007-06-07 22:02:00,303,"what else can you say but, WOW!  looks very similar to that fish that was caught in Ontario, which I thought was also a world record at the time.  What is a triploid?"
80926,misfish,2007-06-07 22:03:00,29133, Agreed. But it is huge. Very fat fish.
