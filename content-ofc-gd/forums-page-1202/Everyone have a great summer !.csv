81085,irishfield,2007-06-08 03:20:00,26272,"Looks like we've got everything done....our last obligation was fullfilled this morning as we proudly watched daughter #1 graduate with a BA (with Honours) in New Image Media, from Ryerson University. Took her out for a celebration lunch, saw her ""new"" condo/apartment that she's moving into on Jarvis street with her boyfriend (his financial problem now...LOL) and then high tailed it for Bass Pro.  Very dissappointing trip to BPS...absolutely NOTHING that I had on my shopping list (that's all in their catalogues) on their shelves. Still blew over a grand on Gortex Rain wear for both of us...but didnt' get what I really wanted to complete my boat the way I wanted it.  Left there and met up with ""Tinbanger"" in Barrie. What a fluke for timing that was as when I called him on his cell.... I was maybe 50 cars behind him on the 400 heading North! Picked up a prize for the table at Lakair from him and will thank Dave on the winners behalf ahead of time right here and now.  Will see many of you at Lakair in the next week or two. We'll be there from the 18th to the 25th and are in Cabin #7.  Good luck on the water gals/guys and play SAFE !  Cheers, Wayne"
