For a $1,000 you can fly anywhere in Ontario as many times as you want for the entire summer. Pretty good deal seeing it sometimes costs $600 to go from Toronto to Windsor return. Here is the link if your interested.  Ontario Pass   Rob C"

I spent $300 for a west jet flight up to thunder bay a few weeks ago for a flight this would have covered (July 5 -9).  2 more fishing weekends and I'd have covered the cost, think I might have to see what my refund policy is and how many weekends my buddies back home are available (or if they'll lend me their boats hehe).  Thanks for the heads up"
