Question is.......what point is he trying to get across to everyone. What was the reason for this, and what series/and game number in the series did this scene take place.  I have the answer, just thought it would be a fun trivia question. No prizes LOL!!"
80778,bbog,2007-06-07 15:55:00,665,Wasn't that in the Montreal - Boston series where the Bruins were called for too many men on the ice. Don't remember the year but believe this is the scenario.

80784,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-07 16:19:00,4399,"I believe it was 1979 too many men on the ice,Guy Lafleur scored the tying goal on the power play and eventually won the game in overtime of game 7 and if memory serves it was the semi final in Montreal."
80884,blaque,2007-06-07 20:18:00,2419," Just got back from fishing 8 days straight..........ready for more, but kinda gotta spend 10 hours a day in the office during the week.
