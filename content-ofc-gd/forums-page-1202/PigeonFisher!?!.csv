The last 12 were just terrible, the result was many months of agony.  We expect this times planning will allow us to really enjoy the summer and that the new one will be healthier and happier for his first few months.  With any luck I will get a report back to you all tomorow with weights and toe counts, etc...  A real Gentleman, Roy Boudreau once told me something while we shared a drink at his kitchen table.  ""You don't know what love is until you have children""...I agree.  Carson Steven Crooks, we so patiently await your arrival.  Your brother has made your Mom and I two of the happiest folks on earth and we know that you will follow in his footsteps.  Our love will be shared with you from your first day until our last!  See ya tomorow, Pal!!!"
