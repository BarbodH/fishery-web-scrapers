81109,Victor,2007-06-08 03:58:00,1609,Hey guys & girls ... does anyone happen to have Fishing World's 1-800 number? Wanted to check a few prices before i head down there.  thanks!
81114,carp-starter,2007-06-08 04:20:00,253,"Yes they are down. Hacked probably again.  I got the phone number from the web. I entered just ""fishing world hamilton"". I hope the other web sites are correct.  905-573-2288  This is not the first time for them. In the past, when they were down, it was because someone hacked into their site and caused some difficulties. So, they just closed down their web site.  carp-starter (Victor) -"
