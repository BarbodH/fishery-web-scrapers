81040,JMBonn,2007-06-08 02:09:00,3,"  Gerrit..   Thanks for the welcome.  This new member is a 63 year old fisherman who has explored & fished most of the waters in Hastings County, Algonquin Park and had some delightful trips to Northern Ontario waters over the years. A few trips out on Lake Ontario searching for salmon off Wellington.  Luv Bass Fishin' - spent most of my teen years on Consecon Lake in Prince Edward County up in the swamp nailing the large mouth bass.  Been away from it for the past 10 years & now jumping back into the fishing sport...grandkids will do that to you!  Live close to Brighton Bay & have heard many stories over the years about the greeat fishing but never tried it out.  Thus the inquiry!  Would appreciate any advice!"
81074,ehg,2007-06-08 03:01:00,2666,"Brighton Bay isn't that large and is relatively shallow. I've caught largemouth bass there around the marina docks and other structure. Walleye were caught trolling Rapalas down the Murray canal and towards the deeper waters of Lake Ontario, by the bouys at the mouth of the bay. There are mostly pike there, that you can catch on #5 silver spinners and Rapala Husky jerks casting in bays around docks, or other visible structure.  Good luck and welcome,  ehg"
