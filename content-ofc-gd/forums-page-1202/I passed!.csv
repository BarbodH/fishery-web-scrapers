81491,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-08 21:38:00,1183,Well done!!   I just finished 4 weeks of a 6 week course...struggled every day to stay awake.  Get all that classroom room stuff done while you are young.
81516,Billy Bob,2007-06-08 22:46:00,5865,"Nice Job. Now here is a EASY question for you. It's time to FISH or cut bait, you make the choice.  My oldest son has been studing for 3 week now to take his medical board exams in 2 weeks. If he passes I just might have to call him ""Doc"""
81542,Rich Clemens,2007-06-08 23:53:00,3131,A doctor of fishing Matt ?      They don't stand a chance.
81544,motv8tr,2007-06-08 23:54:00,2587,"Awesome Matty...so soon we'll be calling you Doc  .  Good stuff, and sounds like an interesting thesis topic.  Maureen"
81561,mattyk,2007-06-09 00:15:00,2110,"My funding last for another two years,  so hopefully thats how long it will take me. It has taken me 2 years to get all my course work done, and now i need to get some research and writing done. I am so sick of school, but im gonna stick with it until i finish. During the summer i will be taking it easy and spending about 5 weeks in Ontario musky fishin."
81267,mattyk,2007-06-08 15:11:00,2110,"I just got news I passed my comprehensive exam. 3 full days of torture 8 hours per day of sitting in front of a computer, and in total 60 pages of writing about urban planning.  I advanced to doctoral candidacy and now all thats left is to write a little thesis. Those fish better watch it now."

81307,mattyk,2007-06-08 16:22:00,2110,"thanks for the kind words all. I do research with natural disasters and i want to focus on emergency rescue services and take a social justice equity perspective, ie do the poor get equal access to emergency services as the rich. This is where the fun begins."
81309,ccmtcanada,2007-06-08 16:31:00,7971,"WOW!! Congrats!! Urban Planning...so you head to an undeveloped area....look around...find out if any fish are there and if so then recommend leave it as is??? haha.  Seriously...it's a great accomplishment...enjoy your summer before the ""little"" thesis comes up!!"
81318,Zib,2007-06-08 16:56:00,369, Great news. Now they can hire you as the new head of FEMA & we can actually have someone in charge that knows what the hell they're doing.
81326,Golfisher,2007-06-08 17:03:00,586,"Matt, congratulations on moving a step closer to the finish line!  As someone who was in your shoes not too long ago, I remember how stressful it was to go through the comp exam process--reading tons, studying tons, writing tons, and then fending off all these exam committee members picking on every minute detail of my answers.  You've come a long way, but brace yourself as that ""little"" thesis can bring a lot of nasty suprises down the road.  Mine was supposed to take a couple of years; I ended up spending nearly four years, and the little thesis turned into a 400-page tome, so dry and boring that even my wife couldn't get beyond the first few pages!  But all that misery is to come later on; for now, enjoy your accomplishment as much as you can.  Congrats once again!  Oh yeah, as someone else already said, start typing!"
81329,Danubian,2007-06-08 17:06:00,65,Way to go Matty! Congrats!

81383,wask,2007-06-08 18:43:00,174,"Man, you guys are going to get stomped in Morgantown this fall... Let's go Mountaineers! <br><br>  Sorry, couldn't resist.<br><br>    <img src=""http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o171/wvwask/WVUseal.jpg?t=1181327848"">"
