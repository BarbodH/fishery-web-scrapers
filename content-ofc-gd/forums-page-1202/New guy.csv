80608,Kev,2007-06-07 04:05:00,54,"Hello all,  Just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Kevin and i'm from Sturgeon Falls. By the looks of it i'm one of many people fishing Nipissing on this site. I hope to be able to share alot of information with everyone, I mostly fish for walleye, smallmouth bass and pike, although i've finally decided to start musky fishing this year. I can't wait 'till it opens here.  Looking forward to becoming part of the community.  Kev"

80773,Pochucker,2007-06-07 15:43:00,16,"Welcome Kevin, I'll be heading up to your neck of the woods 2nd week of July(7th) (west nipissing resort) with my 13yr old grandson and wife. I find its always important to find fish quickly to get the trip off to a good start for him. Mainly pike and bass fishermen (fledgling muskie fisherman) total catch and release. Should I target pike or bass first to get off to good start?  Thanks"
