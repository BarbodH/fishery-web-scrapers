BEIJING (AFP) - Fishery officials were caught out trying to restock a Chinese river when the 13 truckloads of carp they unloaded were netted by over 1,000 villagers downstream, state media reported Thursday.  ADVERTISEMENT  More than 3,000 workers in northeastern China spent two hours dumping fish worth 70,000 yuan (9,100 dollars) into the Songhua river earlier this week in an effort to improve its ecology, the Xinhua news agency said.  But minutes after the operation was completed, thousands of residents from nearby Jinlin city swarmed to the riverbank with nets and other fishing equipment to scoop up the easy catch.  Officials patrolling the river attempted to confiscate some of the tackle, but no arrests were made, the report added.  The restocking on Tuesday was part of China's efforts to mark World Environment Day."
