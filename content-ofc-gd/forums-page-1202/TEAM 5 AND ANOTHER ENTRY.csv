81187,Stoty,2007-06-08 13:09:00,2910,"You can enter a bass, even though its OOS?"
81189,motv8tr,2007-06-08 13:11:00,2587," If it's the one I'm thinking of, then it was caught in season in the states and therefore acceptable.  Maureen"

81197,ccmtcanada,2007-06-08 13:17:00,7971,"As long as the person caught it in the States in their home waters, it's ok.  If it's someone who lives in Ontario was down there visiting, then it's not eligible.  At least that's what I think this mean....am I wrong?  Here's the rules....  ""Fish must be caught legally by angling methods only. No fish that appears to be caught illegally will be considered. Fish must be in season. Fish entered must comply with 'caught fish' regulations for the jurisdiction in which they are caught. Fish must be caught in waters of the the Province of Ontario (all of a body of water that lies at least partially within the boundaries of Ontario is considered Ontario waters...ie all of Lake Erie is eligible) or in the case of out of province members, fish must be caught in their home state or province or the waters previously outlined."""
