Anyhow, there's a coleman warehouse sale that I thought might be of interest to board members.  There's also sunbeam and a few other brands there but I can't keep my tent warm with a blender so I'm not too interested in those items .  Its from this Friday til the 17th and is out in Mississauga, details in the PDF:   Coleman Warehouse Sale Details"
