81168,Zib,2007-06-08 12:41:00,369,"The weather forecast called for a beautiful day out so I said ""screw it"". ""I'm taking the day off & going fishing!""  I picked up a guy from my Lake St. Clair fishing site, whom I fished with before, & we headed to Lake St. Clair to our smallmouth honey hole. We fished for about 6 hours & caught a total of 54 fish (slow day for us, lol). Caught a few rockies, 5 small pike up to 28”, a handful of small largemouth & the rest smallmouth that averaged around 2 ½ pounds, with the biggest going 3 ½ pounds.  The guy I fished with caught a monster carp that weighted 21 pounds (no length taken). The carp almost spooled him so I chased it down with the trolling motor.          Here's the monster smallie of the day.    BTW, In Michigan waters of LSC there is a catch & release season from the last Saturday in Arpil until the 3rd Friday in June. Regular bass season opens the 3rd Saturday in June on LSC. Bass season is open in the rest of the state."

81188,tonyb,2007-06-08 13:10:00,1637," Ok now that is incredible, that has to be the smallest bass I have seen!  Did it put up much of a fight?  Tony"
81195,Bly,2007-06-08 13:14:00,1556,Can't imagine getting into that many fish in one trip.......lucky you!!   Thanks for sharing and that monster smallmouth was amazing! LOL    bly
81204,Zib,2007-06-08 13:22:00,369, Earlier in the C&R season we were catching over 100 fish in a day & the bass & pike were bigger. Fishing was so easy even a cave man could do it.   Of course there were other guys from my other fishing group that fished the same area as us but didn't catch anywhere close to what we were catching.
81357,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-08 17:52:00,2585,great fish!  those were some nice looking bass!  Cheers!
81367,ccmtcanada,2007-06-08 18:13:00,7971,Great pics and fish there!!! I have never seen a fish that small on a treble like that before...LOL.  Did you release it??? haha.  Good thinking explaining the C&R/seasons for bass in your area too!
81370,Fishnfiend,2007-06-08 18:19:00,357,Awesome pictures!  Some nice smallies there.  What are the odds of hooking a fish smaller then one's hook?  That has to be one of the coolest pictures I have seen - even if the fish was mortally impaled.
81371,mattyk,2007-06-08 18:21:00,2110,Looks like a real fun day. Thanks for sharing.
