For me, you do not have to post more info as it comes available. I have enough with what you have released so far. I will do something more interesting instead of going to the ""show"".  carp-starter"

81027,lazybum,2007-06-08 02:01:00,142,Somehow I recall reading a post in here some time ago about the Spring Fishing Show being incorporated into the Toronto Sportsmen Show in March.  I think was an announcement from Outdoors Magazine.  Now I'm confused.
