Had only few sec to look at it, but they have few Legends, some big fiberlass boats and other tin cans. Big Mercury sign on front. Three service bays (former car garage ??? ). Later today I will take a closer look."

Got most things fixed, Check Engine light still comes on, they were not able to fix that.  They did go quite the distance though.  Honestly I would buy another car from them.  Ron is a good solid guy.  Entropy"
