81432,Puckhead,2007-06-08 20:20:00,377,"  I couldn't agree with you more Dan.  The experience of getting in a plane and flying somewhere is neat, but it doesn't make a difference in terms of ""quality"" fishing.  I personally would have a hard time paying that kind of coin unless that plane met me at pearson so I could avoid the drive..."
81437,solopaddler,2007-06-08 20:31:00,8605," Yeah, there's no doubt whatsoever you guys are absolutely right. I've done more than my share of those kinds of trips myself. The big advantage of a fly in is the ease of planning and logistics. You can take off for a 3-4 night fly in trip to an outpost camp with nothing else to plan and bring other than you're food, clothes and fishing tackle. Concentrate on nothing else other than fishing and having fun. The back lakes/bush bashing trips are awesome, but they're also a lot more involved.... They're both great in their own way...."
80908,Billy Bob,2007-06-07 21:02:00,5865,"I have only done two fly-ins and the walleye fishing was nothing less than fantastic on both separate trips/areas.  However, the last one which was two years ago was nothing less than a pig pen for accomodations. Some of you may know the area, it's Goga.... Lodge. The owner should be ASHAMED of himself to expect guest to stay in the dump he put us in.  First thing we did was spend about 3 hours cleaning up the SHACK we stayed in to feel just a little bit comfortable to eat and sleep in the DUMPY shack. Not to mention the outhouse only had 2 1/2 walls holding it up. Good thing we had fair weather because I'm sure a strong storm would of taken out the out house.  But like I said the fishing was EXCELLECT with the 14' STEEL boats and 3 hp outboard motors barely adequate. Since the owner knew we were from the US he would only take US CASH from us, as he really is a American also. I kind of think he is scamming the Canadian government out of tax money but with a operation he is running it would be par for the course."
80912,AzuluSpookd,2007-06-07 21:19:00,348,"You guys all have some very interesting points, points that I will consider when I do my first fly in!  I did drive 12 hours up to Longlac last year and camped in the bush and caught a phenominal amount of walleye!!!  The only thing we had to pay for was gas, food and drinks"
80944,ssauvain,2007-06-07 23:14:00,77,"Jason The outfitter is KayAir...Peter and Karen Kay. I have personally been to Saddle Lake outpost and they also have a very short portage walk, about 3 minutes, to a river/lake system, over there are more boats, motors, and gas and the walleye fishing is unreal!!!! We are going this year to Birch Lake which according to references and Peter is actually bigger walleye then Saddle Lake and just as fast of action. The bonus is a larger lake and the opportunity to catch Lake Trout too...everything is very well done. Their website is www.kayair.com   tell them Bob Sauvain and his son Steve sent you!!!!! It really is a first class operation."
80951,Moosebunk,2007-06-07 23:34:00,3970,"Point #1.  Make sure where you're going is LOADED with fish and it's 99% garunteed you'll be SLAYING those BOHEMUTHS.  then,  To Point #2.  Make sure the person you're fishing with is someone you can fish with in any and every way.  then,  The Fly-In Outfitter you have chosen won't even really even matter.  You'll be having too much fun to care that you're sleeping in a bears den on a mattress of bat scat and eating pounds of maggots through your nose in an exhausted slumber after a day of the best fishing of your life.    And always remember you have an instant fix to all things bad.  I call it Scotch, but others have their preferences."
80993,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-08 01:27:00,957,"I've made several flights with Peter Kay.  If Pete says you're going to leave a 7:00 a.m., you'd better be on the plane at 6:50 a.m. because he's going to have air under his wings at 7.  He won't hire anyone who drinks coffee or smokes because he wants his employees to work with both hands.  I appreciate being with a pilot who owns his plane, is in the business to make money and who values his own life when flying."
81050,danc,2007-06-08 02:24:00,4677,"I'm sure that a fly in fishing trip is on almost everyone's ""to do"" list. But with a little bit of homework, you guys can have the trip of your life without flying anywhere. If you're willing to drive from Toronto to the Kenora area, you've driven past 1000's of prime fishing areas on your way west. Maybe not right on the trans Canada, but not too far north from it. Personally, I'd rather park at a lake with nobody else there than stay at a lodge. Do some home work. Look at some maps. Ask questions. Northwestern Ontario is a vast area of untapped fishing opportunities if you get off the beaten path a mile or two. Ask tjsa how much he'd pay to catch a 40+ Pike. I can answer that for him. He wouldn't pay a nickel. Cuz they're everywhere up here. But like me, he doesn't target them. We don't like Pike up here. They're a pest fish in our books. But if that's what you want, come on up. Most of you guys have seen Rons reports from up here the past 4 years or so. He came here blind and posted pictures each year of trophy Pike, Lake Trout and Brookies each year. He fished right in my back yard and fished places that I never heard of before. He did his homework is all. Bottom line is this. If you need to get on an airplane to catch fish and want to get pampered, then by all means go for it. If you want a better experience, get out a map and head north."
81148,ssauvain,2007-06-08 11:42:00,77,Tennessee Guy...did you ever fly in to Birch??? We are going there in early July...heard it is very good fishing...would love any help! I agree about Peter...and that is exactly how my dad is and that is why we like him so much!!!
81152,mepps,2007-06-08 11:49:00,1301,"I've only flown into one plce, and both trips were greats."
81155,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-08 12:01:00,957,"Haven't been to Birch, but I'm sure you can expect good fishing."
81163,solopaddler,2007-06-08 12:28:00,8605, If that's the Birch Lake that feeds into the Cat Lake chain of lakes then I'm familiar with it. I paddled through year a while back....
81183,Headhunter,2007-06-08 13:06:00,5703,Thanks to all who have replied... great info there and especially to DanC for removing the rose coloured glasses I've been wearing and getting me to think that my dream trip is significantly more within my reach... if I can afford the gas!LOL And to Moosebunk for clearing up the difference between flying in and a 5 star hotel!LOL HH
81276,ssauvain,2007-06-08 15:33:00,77,Do share your great wisdom solopaddler   you are the master :worthy:and yes it is that birch lake.
81303,fishnsled,2007-06-08 16:16:00,3520,"Good points Dan.  I've been on dozens of fly ins, as it was part of my job years ago.  Never had a bad experience but they were all bending over backwards to please us.  In a couple of weeks I'll be going on my first fly in trip (outpost camp) in about 20 years.  I'm going in with 5 other guys of which I know one.  The one I do know I have fished with a couple of times and always had a good time.  He's the one who has organized the trip and I feel I can trust his judgement.  He has assured me that it's a great group of guys, they have been doing it for years.  With the emails that have been going back and forth I do believe it's a great bunch to be sharing a few days with.  I guess that is Moosebunk's #2 point.  His number one point is taken care of as well as a buddie of mine was at the same lake a couple of weeks ago and they caught over 800 walleye during their stay.  With the meals that are planned it's bound to be an excellent trip.  Good people, good fishing and good food, what more do you need?  I've also been told by my buddy the the cabin was in excellent shape as were the boats and motors.  I'll have my report at the end of the month."
