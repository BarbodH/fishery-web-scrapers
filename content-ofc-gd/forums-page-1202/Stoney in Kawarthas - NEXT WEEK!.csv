80251,T-Bone,2007-06-06 14:26:00,160,I read some recent reports from Stoney that the bite for walleyes was pretty bad so far this year. We're driving up from Ohio next week for a 7-day stay at Pine Vista in Gilchrist Bay.  How's the walleye bite been lately? Any insights on tactics and patterns is appreciated.  Thanks.
80554,kingofthesteelhead,2007-06-07 01:51:00,140,My trailer is located at Percy Littles just across from Pine Vista Resort. I have been up about 4 times this year so far and have been finding some crappie 12-14 inches with also quite a few small ones. we have been spending so much time crappy fishing that we have not had time to try for walleye. From what I seen this year there are not too many walleyes being caught. Stay away from cold fronts and fish on deep weedlines. They should be starting to turn on soon. Will be up there on and off if you want to pm me please feel free.

From what I hear, its been very tough up there so far.  Hey T-bone where are you getting the crappie's? I wouldnt mind a nice feed of them!"
