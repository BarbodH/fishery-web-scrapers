81034,holdfast,2007-06-08 02:06:00,1813,I cant stop laughing  Thanks  Moose
80756,steve_paul,2007-06-07 15:13:00,658,"  Was funny watching Niedermayer tugging the cup away from Bettman last night, don't think he really wanted too much to do with him and certainly didn't want him holding the cup.  Also anyone find that Alfie resembles the guy in the Mastercard commercial who ""dreams"" of driving the zamboni.  Just my thoughts on the end of the season."
80764,blaque,2007-06-07 15:24:00,2419," Thats HILARIOUS Steve.......i laughed my arse off when Bettman had the cup ripped out of his hands, and neidermayer actually almost gave him a look like, ""I dont think so gary, just gimme the cup"" lol. If gary was holding on tighter, i think neidermayer may have taken him across the table along with the cup HAHA. Very astute observations, cuz i also walked in teh room during the MC commercial and did a double take............thought it was Alfie in his younger years."
80774,OhioFisherman,2007-06-07 15:43:00,6623,Now I get hockey! They are playing for a fancy beer mug!
80830,NBR,2007-06-07 17:52:00,163,Having lived in the Detroit area for many years my team is the Wings but near or at the bottom are the Ducks. So I was rooting for the Sens big time.

80947,Moosebunk,2007-06-07 23:17:00,3970,"Looking forward to the next Mighty Ducks feature film in about 2 decades.  The movie, a Disney Pixar film, based on a true story, will retell  the road to victory for a bunch of have-not Californians from the ghettos of Anaheim.  How they overcame a thousand and one odds and were slum gritty, but cleaned themselves up, only to play real gritty in the end.  A team of bums, drunks, dwarves and Invincibles (like Vinny Papale of the Philly Eagles, or Rudy from that other football movie) turned highly conditioned intellectuals which studied the game tapes of past Lord Stanley winning teams such as the foul weathered Hurricanes and Lightning of other southern nasty climes and ""8-Mile"" streets.  A bearded McCauley Culkin is rumored to play the part of Neidermayer, and, that kid that says ""I see dead people"" in the 6th Sense is working on beefin' up his forearms to have enough elbow to play the Prongz.  It'll be a tearjerker with a happy ending for sure.  Blossom of NBC's past awesome hit ""Blossom"" has successfully made it through her sex change and will be playing the role of a nasty little rich kid from the city of Federal Taxes that all Senators fans had a role in punishing the rest of the nation of Canada with.  Blossom's character name in the movie will be ""Alfie,"" but the writers will have retired his number 11 for 666 instead and he'll wear a helmet with horns, carry a pitch-forked hockey stick, and have hoove liked skates."

79909,Billy Bob,2007-06-05 21:56:00,5865,"I support two teams, the Sabres and any team that beats the Sens."
79983,charlied,2007-06-06 00:12:00,584,I think it is not just a hate for Alfredson I think it is a hate for not only the sens but the Sens fans.  There is only one thing a leaf fan hates more than rush hour traffic and thats a sens fan!  The rivalry between the 2 teams goes way back!
79997,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-06-06 00:27:00,0,"It has nothing to do with Hockey, all canadians are envious of Ottawa that's all. They just hate Ottawa because we're stuck with the government.  I know this will never happen but if it was the makebeliefs in the finals vs an American team they would get my support."
80001,Daplumma,2007-06-06 00:35:00,1961,"Being from south of the border but a hockey lover all I can say is WOW!!!Honestly,no one down here could care less about hockey,but the politics facinate me.Go Caps... Joe"
80006,Clampet,2007-06-06 00:40:00,1947, You left out the Montreal Canadians.  They are a Canadian Icon for many Notherners.
80053,Moosebunk,2007-06-06 01:22:00,3970,"You said it Clamp-It.  My second favorite team for sure.  One Swede I loved to watch back when I was a kid, Mats Naslund.  But, Carbonneau, Gainey, Robinson, Lafleur, Muller, Roy, .......who can argue with all the other greats that have played for the greatest Dynasty in any sport.  Go HABS Go."
80126,holdfast,2007-06-06 03:31:00,1813,"I am all Canadian, But watching our National sport go to the dumps make me mad.  There is too much politics and bleeding hearts that have infiltrated this place and hockey is one of them.  People are crying about the fights, the aggression and lack of goals.  So the league decides to penalize everything, just like the European leagues. ( Reminds me of Pickup games)  My favorite team the Mtl Canadians, have gone European.  They play like Europeans.  Their Captain is European.  Ive seen some horrible Trades and draft pick go for Europeans or that possible popular Franco. Most of are Canadian teams are employing more Europeans than ever.  It must be because they're cheaper is the only thing I could think of.  Now the Sens, They play like Europeans, Act like Europeans.  And Alfred son has no Business being the Captain of any team.  He even skated away from Niedermeyer after that stupid episode.  What kind of Garbage is that we are now watching.  The Sens are useless if they aren't on the power-play or if there is hitting.  Have you ever been to Ottawa.  Reminds me too much like Quebec, horrible drivers and the fans would jump ship for Mtl if they would ever have a hope in @@3334 of making the cup.  But that would not happen for another decade unless they got rid of 3/4s of the team"
80149,Badger Shark,2007-06-06 06:25:00,291,"Some of you guys are really harsh.  Hate is a very strong word and we are talking hockey here are we not.  I have to admit some of this talk really makes my blood boil.  I do agree with some of the points made but HATE of sens fans and Ottawa is pretty small minded.  I live here and was born here.  I have also lived in Vancouver and Kansas city. I would not say disparaging things about someones home town unless I lived there and had valid reasons.  I have been to Toronto many times in my life.  I like going there but wouldnt live there because it is just to busy and huge.  As for Alfredson, I do agree that it looked intentional but whos to say and if it was then he should be ashamed of himself, it is a cowardly thing to do.  Other than that he has been a very good person to this community.  I do recall several different leaf players over the years commiting very stupid acts without thinking ( Tucker and the non spitting incident, Domi and many incidents)  but these guys are passionate and people would love to have them on their team, myself included.  I also agree that if we had more north americans on the team we probably would be playing better, I just believe that if you are a canadian hockey player all you ever dreamed of was winning the stanley cup and if you have the chance you are damned sure going to give it everything you have and more.  I think most Europeans and Russians  would rather win a world cup and some are just here trying to cash in.  Anyway the better team is going to win this series and that is the ducks by far, they have played harder and dictated the play.  They are forcing the sens to play their way and are dominating them.  Maybe someday the sens will get  another shot but I dont think it will be for a long time after this one.  At least they made it to the final.  And if the leafs ever make it back to the final, I will cheer for them if they are the loan Canadian team.  I think the comments about the city are not right, just because it is the home of the government.  Toronto is the home of the provincial government, so I guess we can hate Toronto for that?  Seems kinda silly and high-schoolish to me.  Anyway this is just my opinion and I am sure I will get a bunch of flack for it, oh well I can live with it."
80158,OhioFisherman,2007-06-06 10:10:00,6623,"This is coming from a former Cleveland Browns fan so take it for what it is worth. It is probably not your team, the lesson was taught to us by the former owner. It is an organization (business) design to make money for that or those owners, the people that support the team mean little or nothing to them.  Through out the years Cleveland had one of the best attendance ranking in the NFL, was it enough for the owner? No, bad enough that he couldn`t make money off the team he wanted tax dollars for a new stadium. Get people emotional, rah-rah over a pro sport, everyone makes money but the fan.  About the only good thing it gets done is keeps some people off the water! LOL I never let a sport keep me from my sport, fishing. You can be a player too, go fish! Take ownership, boats, tackle, a cabin on a lake? You will be the owner!"
80160,Cookslav,2007-06-06 10:24:00,1457,"Can't do it...I can't cheer the Sens Its like cheering for your taxes...LOL  Can't stand Alfedson, And I thnk its absolutly & fundimentaly wrong to cheer for a rival team just cause My team is out. Besides ""WHEN"" the Ducks win.... The Cup will spend more time in Canada anyway(more Canadian Players)  Is it unpatriotic to Cheer for Canadian players rather then Canadian Teams?...Not when its Ottawa IMO"
