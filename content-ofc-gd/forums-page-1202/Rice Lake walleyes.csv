81226,Stoty,2007-06-08 13:54:00,2910,Might be fishing Rice on Sunday.  Anyone been out recently for walleye's? Hows the bite?
81264,kelvarnson,2007-06-08 15:08:00,15,"Was out last Saturday.  Even with the heat, bright sun AND a tournament going on, we still put 10 in the boat in about an hour.  The action was slow early on, but switched on big time once the wind picked up and a few clouds started floating around.  Suspending Rapalas with a quick start-stop retrieve were all that was working...jigs got nothing. The 'eyes were as aggressive as I've ever seen on Rice Lake.  Also got a 10lb muskie in the same area the walleyes were hitting.  They were relatively shallow, 6 - 8ft, and were relating to heavy weeds.  Click here for pics   Good luck...."
81270,Stoty,2007-06-08 15:20:00,2910,Awesome!!!  I hope they are still in the aggressive mood this weekend!  Thanks for the tips!
81308,radar,2007-06-08 16:25:00,138,"Was out yetserday for a couple of hours. Got one nice 4 pounder on white grub working weed edges at a drop off right out of Bewdley 8-13 feet.  Didn't see much else happening, but I wan't trying to hard. It was a real nice surprise - I was really just out to fart around in the boat.  PS Thanks to the 2 guys who helped retrieve my boat when the clasp broke on my launching line. How embarassing watching the clasp break off and your boat float away while you go to park your trailer."
