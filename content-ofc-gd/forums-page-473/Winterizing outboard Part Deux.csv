635906,Rob,2011-10-30 17:42:00,467,"Does anyone add plumbing antifreeze to the 4 stroke engines or does the water completely drain when the engine is down. I was thinking of adding antifreeze to the water intake on my 4 Stroke Honda with the hose attachment, but if the water drains out completely, should I bother?  Rob C"
635907,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-30 17:51:00,4399,"I have never heard of putting antifreeze in a outboard, make sure the outboard is tilted down and it should drain."
635912,lew,2011-10-30 18:20:00,12766,"I always pour anti-freeze into my bilge pump lines and circulating pump lines then hit the pumps just for a second to be sure it's distributed everywhere.  Infact anywhere you may have water laying in low places you need to put anti freeze.  I store my electronics in the house too, but that's just me."

635925,Sinker,2011-10-30 19:17:00,8692,It will drain in the down position. Your antifreeze would just run out as well.  S.
635935,RickOnt,2011-10-30 20:04:00,669,"I was wondering about the Bilge and the Livewell pumps!!!  I thought just giving them a whirl when out of the water would pump out any standing water,  But should I be putting some antifreeze in them??  Rick"

636225,Fish4Eyes,2011-10-31 17:47:00,1022,"With my 40hp Evinrude I find if I lower it all the way it leaks water. Then when it stops leaking I raise it up all the way and lower it again, and sure enough more water comes out. Might be worth a shot."
636549,bigbuck,2011-11-01 14:36:00,2449,"Any antifreeze you pump into the motor will just end up draining away. Don't bother. Just throw some stabil or whatever stabilizer you choose into the fuel and run it for a few minutes, fog it, change the lower unit oil and your done."
636588,scugpg,2011-11-01 16:57:00,1373,"If your still concerned, what about using low-pressure compressed air through the tell-tale hole? Or through the water intakes on the lower unit? That might get any remaining water out.  Leaving the motor all the way down should suffice though as it should drain everything out."
