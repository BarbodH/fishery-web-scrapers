635608,Skipper D,2011-10-29 19:33:00,1970,Dose any one here have the new 2011 Starcraft 176 Superfisherman boat ? Iam looking at one and wondering if others like theirs .
635620,Handlebarz,2011-10-29 20:18:00,3790,I have a 1994 version of it and love it
635622,lew,2011-10-29 20:28:00,12766,Starcraft makes a quality boat IMO Skipper. I had a couple tiller models years ago and they were very well made. I'd assume the current models are also good but I'm just speculating  on that.
635649,Skipper D,2011-10-29 21:52:00,1970,"I know nothing about them , never had a new boat but i think i like what i see . There are some good deals going on out there right now and maybe thought i should take the plunge ."
635658,Grimace,2011-10-29 22:18:00,2020,I always drool at Starcraft boats.
635677,alexmedic,2011-10-29 23:31:00,186,I've got a 2004 StarFire and am very happy.  I kinda wish my floor was not carpeted though.  It seems to take forever to dry.  But that's just me being picky!
635685,Skipper D,2011-10-29 23:48:00,1970,"Well i am with you there , this new has carpet in it as well , not fussy on it either , thinking i should take a step back and look at some thing with the vinyl ."
635710,aplumma,2011-10-30 00:36:00,6896,I removed the carpet in the driver section on my Ranger and put vinyl in last winter. While it is easier to keep clean and I needed a place to deck the fish besides the carpet it does get hot in the sun. I usually fish barefooted because hopping overboard happens quite often when it is hot down here.   Art
635719,Skipper D,2011-10-30 00:44:00,1970,"  lol same , the first thing i do always is get the shoes off once i am in the boat , Maybe Art if i ask , i wonder maybe the marina would do the same to the boat as you did with the vinyl while making the deal . You would think they would offer new boats in both so we'ed have the choice in the same models."
635720,Sinker,2011-10-30 00:45:00,8692,You can't go wrong with a starcraft.  S.
635722,Skipper D,2011-10-30 00:51:00,1970," Thanks Sinker , i should post a picture of the one am looking at ."
635745,Skipper D,2011-10-30 02:06:00,1970,"I like all the features on this one , the trailer also ."
635749,Sinker,2011-10-30 02:17:00,8692,"She's a beauty!! I've had a starcraft since ""93. She doesn't leak a drop. Its nothing special to look at now, but she's done me well all those years with no problems whatsoever!! Very versatile boat!!  S."
635759,Handlebarz,2011-10-30 02:50:00,3790,I am also a bare foot fisherman and love the carpet its not slippery when I am fishing in the rain or fall on them frosty mornings like tomorrow will be.  A buddy has a crestliner with vinyl and I can not stand it I will always get carpet JMO
635769,OutdoorDan,2011-10-30 03:56:00,325,"I got a 196 Fishmaster this year and love it.  The only difference of the Fishmaster from the Superfisherman is the full spashwell, and the Superfishermans are a little more carpeted inside.  If I'm not mistaken, are those pics from Marsh's?  That is where I got mine."
635786,Skipper D,2011-10-30 09:40:00,1970,"  Marshs is the place , i've dealt with them a couple of times this year and they done me ok ."
635797,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-30 11:05:00,1107,carpet on the casting decks and vinyl on the floor(deck) and ya have the best of both worlds thats how my lund is and I love it my smokercraft was all carpet and it sucked to keep clean and stayed wet all the time .Starcrafts are great boats I sold a 1983 that ran like a top before I bought the lund.
635927,Sinker,2011-10-30 19:29:00,8692,"Im another carpet hater. All it does is collect dirt, hooks, and never dries out.  There are pluses and minus's with each though I suppose, so whatever works for you!  S."
635948,OutdoorDan,2011-10-30 20:54:00,325,"If you wear soft soled shoes or boots then slipping on vinyl is not a problem at all.  Carpet would stink of fish slimy very quickly and would be very annoying.  With vinyl you can just take a hose and wash everything down at the end of the day, and hooks don't get caught in it."
636054,Skipper D,2011-10-31 03:00:00,1970,"A friend called me this aftr noon and said i should take a look at a Stanley Boat  ,  not sure ,  but from what he was saying i think their big money , i better go online and check just in case ."
636061,woodenboater,2011-10-31 03:13:00,2277,"Don't understand carpets either and if slipping on vinyl is a worry, just stick some anti slip tape down. They come in clear or white so that should make them stealthy and they're fairly weather resistant as well. The ones on my front porch have seen all manner of weather and heavy foot traffic and still have great stiction.  Yep Skipper, the Mink line looks pretty good. First saw them while heading up 69 and they sure catch the eye don't they."
636064,Skipper D,2011-10-31 03:16:00,1970,i have'nt had time to go check yet.....lol
636066,OutdoorDan,2011-10-31 03:33:00,325," You, sir, are awesome."
636068,Skipper D,2011-10-31 03:54:00,1970,"He is is'nt he ... lol . Ijust had a look at the Stanley boat line up , they'er some thing eles, real nice tho but more money alright , if i went their way i'd have to have the islander and thats never going to happen . Its back to Starcraft for this guy ."
