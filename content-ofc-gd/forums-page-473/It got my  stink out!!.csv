Big Cliff has a spray on scent eleminator he has been formulating and I got a chance to try it out over the week.  It's called Nok Out and its the best scent eleminator I've every tried.  Tried it on my hands after playing with some GULP and one application the smell was GONE!!  Also tried it ono the lingering skunk smell on my bulldog ZsaZsa and it worked with one application, Ive tried about 5 different products to get the last of the skunk odour off of her and it removed it on the first try.  On the weekend I had a nice buck come right up the path 5 minutes after I had walked it with my boots that had been sprayed. He didnt even notice.  Hopefully he gets it to market and everyone can try it out, its really really good..  Darren  Didnt get a shot at the buck tho..... bummer"
