Rain,Rain,Rain,WindWindWind I caught 1 32"" Walleye down the Reach near the lighthouse, 55FOW with TD11 purple Taildancer 150 back from the in-line board. Talked to a couple charter guys and they said we were lucky, they hadn't moved a rod. Going back for 4 days in Nov. "
635698,Terry,2011-10-30 00:21:00,14456,everyone is saying it's been tough going down there so nice going  I hope in picks up for November around the 18th and 19th and what the heck the 20th too..LOL
635699,Rod Caster,2011-10-30 00:21:00,5784,Nice golden trophy there!  From the weather in the photo it looks like you are fishing in B.C. or Scotland.
635704,Grimace,2011-10-30 00:27:00,2020,Beautiful fish.  I have not made it down that way yet.  I can`t wait.
635707,Skipper D,2011-10-30 00:32:00,1970," Looks like it was worth it , awsome fish ."
635712,Joey,2011-10-30 00:36:00,9122,"Well you sure did well for the conditions, nice fish and congrats!"
635734,mercman,2011-10-30 01:29:00,7054,"Awesome fish, congrats. By the latest reports, Quinte doesnt seem to be producing as well as past years.I wonder why"
635796,Fish Farmer,2011-10-30 11:01:00,2234,"Thanks everyone. After that picture was taken my camera was toast, water got into it with so much rain. All are fish were released. 1 other Walleye was caught in my boat plus the 2 Sheephead. The 3 other guys caught there 2 in the triangle. My stepson, which stayed at another place with his buds caught 2 drifting a spinner and worm in a small bay east of Thompson's Pt. 5 & 10 lb'der."
635800,Roy,2011-10-30 11:16:00,13728,"You're a tough guy, Dave. It's not everyone who would fish in that weather. Congrats on your 32...she's a beaut! I'm not a betting guy but if I was, I'd bet that your November will be fireworks on the Bay.  And Paul, it's as good as it ever was. Every body of water has a few slow days."
635803,Fish Farmer,2011-10-30 11:31:00,2234,"Thanks Roy, my wife has to differ, can't repeat was she calls me Your right about the fishing because I talked to a few guys and they said on Sat. they slaughtered them, and Sunday they shut down. Like my signature says"
635821,solopaddler,2011-10-30 12:53:00,8605,Congrat's on the 32 Dave. My guess is you'll pound them in November if the weather cooperates.
635824,fish_fishburn,2011-10-30 13:03:00,1311,I would say your a bit early Fish Farmer. I will be heading down on Dec 1 to 4. Hopefully the big fat girls will be in by then.
635916,lew,2011-10-30 18:46:00,12766,That's a very respectable pickeral Dave and they should be even better next time you hit the bay.
636088,fishindevil,2011-10-31 11:26:00,6254,"considering the weather dave,you guys did well,nice 32 you got !!!! things will get better..."
636089,Spiel,2011-10-31 11:27:00,9065,How was the fight Dave.....
636536,corvette1,2011-11-01 13:29:00,1765,nice eye dave congrats
636540,Fish Farmer,2011-11-01 13:56:00,2234,"Thanks guys. Chris I have a better fight cranking my boat on the trailer. A 12"" Perch gives a better fight. Funny you say that, you can tell when you get a Sheephead on, it fights. the only movement that Walleye gave was on the floor of the boat, the tail moved a bit. The best way to catch them down there is drifting, at least you get to feel the hit and they do fight better. My stepson got a 10 lb. plus drifting the triangle on a Victor spinner and worm. He said it almost ripped the rod out of his hand. I know thats why you wouldn't waste your time down there. I go mostly because it's being with friends and having a good time."
