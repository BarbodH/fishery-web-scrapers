636055,Rattletrap2,2011-10-31 03:02:00,1652,"Thanks for posting that Norm! Quite an example of unconditional love on both their parts. That is one very good natured Lab! Not a young dog either, but very patient. I don't think I would have let the boy climb on him like that, but hey, he does not seem to mind!"
