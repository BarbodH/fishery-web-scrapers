636504,Roy,2011-11-01 12:24:00,13728,"Let's not make a big issue of this. If you look at the emoticon on Whitespinnerbait's post you'll notice that not even he believes what he said. The authority recruiting this candidate as a police officer probably made a mistake in their assessment and the clip, now that it's gone viral will surely fix the problem. IMHO"
636506,lew,2011-11-01 12:26:00,12766," There is NO emergency serious enough that anyone should be endangering the lives of others while responding to it. It's often necessary to get to an incident in a hurry, but you still need to drive in a manner where your totally in control of your vehicle.  No matter what the emergency may be, 120 MPH would be totally uncalled for unless your on a totally empty hiway."
636515,Fish4Eyes,2011-11-01 12:46:00,1022, You obviously haven't seen their salaries.

636226,SlowPoke,2011-10-31 17:49:00,2984,"I've often seen cops speeding, weaving and driving carelessly and often wondered 'where are they going in such a rush without the lights on?'   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/yStiufMfIl0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
636230,NAW,2011-10-31 18:06:00,4022,"That's  a great video.  Last year, a Barrie police officer (of duty) drove through a OPP ride program plastered drunk.  Got charged for DUI..  This was in Barrie, at the 400 and Bayfield from what I remember."
636236,Roy,2011-10-31 18:21:00,13728,I wish the opposite.
636244,SlowPoke,2011-10-31 18:57:00,2984,"Point taken, Roy. Driving 5000km a week gives me a front row seat for some of the antics on the road and an alarming proportion comes from those that should know better. Cops, truck drivers, cabbies etc."
636246,mike rousseau,2011-10-31 19:01:00,4661,pretty sad when a person who risks their lives for public safety has to take a second job...
636249,woodenboater,2011-10-31 19:05:00,2277,"Toronto police services pays pretty well and paid duty is just extra income afaik. As for the states, no idea but wouldn't be surprised if the pay was not as decent as up here."
636322,fishing n autograph,2011-10-31 22:32:00,2540,"The pay in the northern states is good but the pay in the south is very poor. In new orleans at one pont the average wage for front line officer was $24,000. Cops are human, mistakes are made. No one, even on this board is perfect"

636325,lew,2011-10-31 22:44:00,12766," Sorry Dave, there's a BIG difference between making a mistake and being a  danger to everybody else on the road. That hiway in the video was very busy and that guy could have very easily wiped out an entire family.  120 MPH is FAR from making a mistake !!"
636327,fishing n autograph,2011-10-31 22:50:00,2540,Maybe I shoulda watched the video  120mph to the end of shift is a bonehead mood....hot call is different
636329,Remastered,2011-10-31 22:55:00,143,Maybe if he put the siren on it would have been different.
636335,Whitespinnerbait,2011-10-31 23:32:00,2038,No Harm No Foul
636344,fishing n autograph,2011-10-31 23:41:00,2540,At that speed and traffic conditions lights and sirens is a must. Had it been a deserted highway then no.
636348,woodenboater,2011-10-31 23:47:00,2277,Is he allowed to run tic tocs if he's going to a paid duty assignment ? I was impressed with the female officer and would hate to piss her off.
636351,archer379,2011-10-31 23:53:00,277,couple of weeks back here in peterborough a city cop with the lights and sirens going went through a red light a t boned a under cover OPP car. The city officer was charged.
636352,OutdoorDan,2011-11-01 00:00:00,325,"Putting the sirens on giver you the right of way but it doesn't give you godmode, of course he should be charged."
636355,Rizzo,2011-11-01 00:10:00,4754," ...hmmm can't say I agree with that. If I shoot a gun through a loaded mall and don't hit anyone there's no foul? This guy's car was a loaded gun, just because he didn't kill anyone doesn't mean he did nothing wrong. 120 mph is a stupid speed to be driving and endangers everyone around you"
636360,Terry,2011-11-01 00:17:00,14456,"yeah that is a concern if a cop can't get away with speeding   how the heck can I  there's no hope, I guess I will slow down"
636369,NAW,2011-11-01 00:29:00,4022,"The best part is, it looked like she had her gun drawn!  Maybe she thought the car was stolen.."
636376,OutdoorDan,2011-11-01 00:33:00,325,She says she did think it may have been stolen.
636407,Whitespinnerbait,2011-11-01 01:10:00,2038," Cops are trained to drive at that rate of speed,and the car can handle it"
636409,OutdoorDan,2011-11-01 01:23:00,325, So if I'm a racecar driver I can take my Ferrari onto the 401 and do 200mph?
636415,fishing n autograph,2011-11-01 01:31:00,2540, Actually a friend of mine is a police vehicle operations trainer and went on several courses in the us. He told me the speeds that they train at down there is rediculous......he was freaked and he trained.me lol
636421,Tybo,2011-11-01 01:48:00,1373,Race car drivers have nothing to prove.They do the speed limit.  Full disrespect of the law and people around him. Enough Said.
636500,Rizzo,2011-11-01 12:06:00,4754, great for them. I couldn't care less that they are great drivers and have great cars. Its not them I'm concerned about. How about the mother who has 3 kids in the car? Does a quick check to see nobody beside her to change lanes. Is she trained to expect somebody is about to pass her going twice her speed? What looks like a clear lane to turn into as you travel 55 mph is very suddenly occupied by an idiot. You want to go 120 mph? Buy some time at a track. Its hard to believe you are trying to justify this behaviour.
