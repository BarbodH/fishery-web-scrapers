If so can you give me an indication of how you what you were fishing. Was it a specific hatch or were you using attractor patterns like humpy's and stimulators. I'm going to have to come out there and fish some of those rivers it looks like the adventure of a lifetime. I'm incredibly envious."
635747,jpfishing,2011-10-30 02:13:00,53,Crazy stuff
635760,MJL,2011-10-30 03:10:00,2427,Dude! Totally awesome  I want some cuttie and bully trout action now  You have a chance to visit Milner's place yet?
635813,Spiel,2011-10-30 12:25:00,9065,"Outstanding, beautiful, top drawer!"
635823,solopaddler,2011-10-30 13:00:00,8605,"Truly awe inspiring, I couldn't imagina a more perfect 2 weeks.  I'm finding it hard to get beyond the schnitzel party with the beer in a spring fed hollowed out log though.  Super cool."
635904,Grimace,2011-10-30 17:33:00,2020,"Incredible.  Thanks for posting.  What a beautiful part of the Earth.  You can take a million mountain and river pictures and no matter how beautiful they come out it can never do them justice.  You have to be there, surrounded by them to get a true reading on how remarkable they are.  You did your part though, as those are really sharp looking photographs.  That is to say nothing of the fish.  A very enviable two weeks."
636074,Jet,2011-10-31 05:11:00,364,"      You all know whenever you can make it there are spots on the river waiting for you. I think you'll all love applying your trusty centerpin on our eager and often very big bull trout.    I can definitely guide you to the rivers! We'll both probably have to work to get the fish though.    Yes what a missed opportunity  When I saw your Lake Louise pic I was thinking the very same thing. At least next time you have another destination for your trip out west. Sushi's on me!    Yes Chris it hasn't been the same since.     When are you and Tony coming??? No trip to Milner quite yet. Will be my next centerpin when I rig up and give them Idaho Steelhead a try. Can you say 15 lb main line and 10 lb leads!!!    Yes it was all dry fly action for Cutties and Rainbows. You always try to match the hatch, but what is nice with Cutties is they are often always game. So we switched up between many different flies and bugs such as Fat Albert, Stick Midges, Blue Wing Olvies, Mayflies to name a few. But it is definitely awesome to when there's a big hatch and you have the right fly. When that happens you just can't keep the fish off your line, often the same fish over and over!    Thanks Mike. For a guy that has fished so much that means a lot to hear that from you.  Yes that beverage cooler is really something else. The guy who made it is a great friend of mine, a super smart German who helped me fix up this whole building and build and design the restaurant. He imported a whole building from Germany and reassembled here in Kimberly. It is known as the ""oldest building in Canada."" Built in 1640, disassembled and moved to Kimberley in 1987 to become a restaurant.   Thank you everyone for sitting through my longest report ever. It was by far the best fishing I've done in my whole life and thank you all for coming along and reliving it with me."
635124,Jet,2011-10-28 06:24:00,364,"Work hard, play hard. I've always lived by this motto and I finally got the chance to put it into practice this past September (and I'll take this opportunity to apologize for the belated report).  After a solid year of non-stop work bringing my restaurant from start to finish and then opening, I finally reached September 4 where my two week vacation would begin. I was counting down the days since June. I wanted to have two weeks of not worrying about food deliveries, accounting, payroll and all the other daily chores that come with running your own business.  Even better was that two of my best fishing partners - Jimmy and Chris - from Toronto had committed to coming down this way to accompany me for two weeks of hardcore fishing. By hardcore I mean up at 6:30 a.m. and with the long hours of sunlight here (Cranbrook gets the most hours of sunlight of any place in BC) we'd wrap up our trips around 9 p.m. To be honest the fishing was more exhausting that the restaurant. But of course it was worth every exhausting moment.  For 14 days we visited eight different rivers with many pulling double duty. Most of which was dry fly fishing for Westslope Cutthroat Trout with random trips for Bull Trout and one for Columbia River Rainbows. There are a ton of pictures ahead, so I'll let them do most of the talking.    The day after we closed, we headed to the Skook. It's a far off the beaten track river nearly 40 km down a remote logging road. We stop to bask in the start of what would be an epic journey.      And finally we reach our destination    It is a scenic river and well worth the trek in.    We easily landed over 70 Cutties between the three of us.       After all the Cutty action I decided to see if the Bull Trout had started moving in. Unfortunately it was still early but we managed to pick off a few.        The Kokanee were in full spawning swing. These are landlocked Sockeye Salmon and don't get much bigger than this. This is the reason why why the Bull Trout get so large here.     After the boys got excited about Bull Trout, I decided to hit the Bull River. It is a glacier river that has a good run of spawning Bull Trout. The cutthroat action is also spectacular, but even more impressive is the river itself. It is as about as beautiful as they come.  It begins with the long trek down.   The Bullies were shy but we managed a few.     With all the Cutthroat around, it was likely the Bullies were full most of the time. Here's proof.   Now this is a fishing hole!    Moments later, FISH ON!!   And it did not get away.   Nor did this one.   Gotta love those glacier blue rivers.     A good friend of mine is a guide here, so I decided to hire him to take the boys out on the Elk River. We floated around 12 km and the Cutties were suicidal.                   After five days of hard fishing, we decided it was time for a break. We had a little party out on St. Mary's Lake, a Schnitzel Party to be exact. My friend owns the most popular German restaurant in town, so the Schnitzel's were top notch.  And they were cooked in the biggest frying pan I've seen at least.   My friend made this beverage cooler out of a hollowed out log with a constant stream of glacier spring water. It kept us ""happy"" during the party.   After a day of rest we hit the St. Mary's River.            The action was steady with Cutties with this Cutbow being the highlight of the trip.   Then we set off to an Elk River tributary, with promises of the biggest Cutties in the Kootenay region. And we all smashed our PB and then some.  On the way we stopped to check out the ""World's Biggest Truck.""   Our best Cutty fishing to date was about to begin.            And what a beautiful river it is.          We then headed to Castlegar to try for some Columbia River Rainbows. They get so big here that you can consider them Steelhead. Unfortunately it was a very tough trip and we didn't find the big bows, but that's fishing.  Only one of two bows we managed that trip.    Unfortunately all good things must come to an end. It was the fastest two weeks of my life. I decided to end our trip on the White River. It isn't the best dry fly fishing river, but the water is top notch and the scenery second to none. There's also the chance for Rainbows.  To get to White River you drive down roads with shoulders that look like this.   Now for some scenery.                         The Cutties were average, but this Rainbow caught by my buddy Jimmy made it all worthwhile.    I really want to thank my friends Jimmy and Chris for committing and coming out to spend my vacation with me. It wouldn't have been nearly as memorable if I had to go at it alone.  And thank you all my fellow OFC'ers for coming along for the ride and enduring my long report. Now it's back to work, but stay tuned for a 2011 Bull Trout Run report. So far it has been amazing.  Here's a little taste of my next report.   Thanks for reading!"

Looked like a great trip....thanks for taking the time to post the report!"
