635522,GBW,2011-10-29 13:21:00,8460,I know someone who has fished it a bunch of times.  let's see if he see's this and helps out.
635580,Skipper D,2011-10-29 17:04:00,1970,"Thank GBW , been working there all week two feet away from the water , awfull tempting to bring the fish rod . I asked the same question there but no one had an answer ."
635614,grimsbylander,2011-10-29 19:49:00,3016,I fished it periodically about 10 years ago. There used to be some decent smallies holding tight to the pencil weed. Small lake but fun when they're on.
635615,NAW,2011-10-29 19:59:00,4022,"I didn't do very well the last time I was there.  There are some folks on the board who live on the lake.  If your fishing from shore, probably not going to catch anything."
635629,aniceguy,2011-10-29 21:04:00,1094,"like many of the small lakes it was ruined by fishng pressure, like a similar lake in the grey bruce area it too had large and plentiful bass now, well others can chime in  Its a small spring fed lake with no inflow only an outflow, it had a fantastic population of small mouth and the odd tank largie but fisshing pressure ruined it.  Its now a great jet ski lake and with only 1 sand spit ramp sadly its done.  You can wet a line enjoy, there are some hammer handle pike in there also but they are also few and far between, personally your better of having a beer and enjoying the sights"
635634,Skipper D,2011-10-29 21:30:00,1970,"I stood on a dock there yesterday watching a school of good size minnows moving a round and wondered which kind they were . I thought this was a good sign for that lake , i wonder if it ever receive any restocking . I have seen jet skis going wild on it , now at this time of year its pretty quit out there ."
635637,Skipper D,2011-10-29 21:34:00,1970,  I better wave Hi then .......... huh Nick.
635673,NAW,2011-10-29 23:13:00,4022," Last time I was there I saw a guy on a jet ski with a beard bigger then big chev's.  Towing a kid on a GT Snowracer, no spotter.  It was quite the sight to see.."
635692,Skipper D,2011-10-30 00:06:00,1970,"  i'll bet it was , I heard some of the locals are not to impressed with some of the trafic on the lake ."
635702,misfish,2011-10-30 00:23:00,29133,Why bother???????????
635703,Skipper D,2011-10-30 00:26:00,1970,  I don't think any one dose or will Brian .
635838,GBW,2011-10-30 13:24:00,8460,fish a top water lure real slow and have another rod rigged with a senko type bait and give it a shot.  why not try if you have the space and time?
635847,Skipper D,2011-10-30 13:37:00,1970,"My thoughts were , now that the boats are off for the season why not ."
