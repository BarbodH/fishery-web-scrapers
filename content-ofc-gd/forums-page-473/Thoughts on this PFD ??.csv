635871,Tomcat,2011-10-30 14:25:00,395,"Hi Lew:  I've been wearing a Mustang inflatable PFD (model MD3153) since 2006. Similar to other comments, it's so comfortable to wear, you hardly know you have it on. That is the best thing about these inflatable PFDs and consequently, you wear your protection. I had to install my first re-arm kit this year ($65) (they are good for 5 years).  The award-winning MD3153 Inflatable PFD with HIT (Hydrostatic Inflator Technology) is Mustang Survival's top-of-the-line inflatable PFD. Designed for serious users with exclusive technology that enhances safety and minimizes maintenance, this is our most popular inflatable PFD. The Hydrostatic Inflator Technology offers reliable inflation in a low maintenance design that will only automatically inflate when submerged in 4 or more inches of water and not inadvertently due to rain, spray or humidity. Exclusive to Mustang Survival in North America and maintenance-free for 5 years or until inflated. LeBaron's catalogue quotes a price of $225.  LeBaron's price for Mustang model 3053 (different technology - auto bobbin activation) is $185  Regardless which model you end up with, I'm positive you'll be satisfied."
635872,bigbuck,2011-10-30 14:27:00,2449,"After speaking to the OPP officers out on GBay, they have had problems with their automatic pfd's going off in the boat lockers overnight. There is a tablet  that dissolves that triggers the inflation mechanism. If left in a very damp place, the tablet starts to dissolve and over time will end up going off. That's why I got a manual model and it doesn't bother me in the least bit and I wear it when I fish alone or when I'm out cruising with the family."
635873,Tybo,2011-10-30 14:34:00,1373,Joey and I have the hydrostatic pressure ones($300)This one will not miss fire from rain or splashing water. The firing mechanism must be completely submerged.
635874,farsider,2011-10-30 14:40:00,456,"Hey Lew,  In my Lebaron catalog it is listed at $206.63.  Their online catalog lists it at $185.63.  (perhaps it is on sale)  Lebaron Catalog   Usually, you can get an extra 10% off with membership and they also normally have a tax and membership discount before christmas.  Cheers,  Mark"
635875,lew,2011-10-30 14:44:00,12766," Tomcat, that one sounds like maybe a better option, but when I tried to get into the LeBaron catalogue yesterday it won't let me. Something about Adobe Reader not working for PDF files.  Seems like a few folks are having problems with the other models inflating in the rain or whatever, even the OPP.  And KayakMike, good thoughts there, but I kinda like the idea of the self-inflating feature incase I bang my noggin on the way outta the boat and can't pull the ripcord myself."
635876,lew,2011-10-30 14:48:00,12766," Thanks Mark, seems like Lebarons has some good prices but even with your link it won't let me in. Still something with my Adobe Reader"
635883,bare foot wader,2011-10-30 15:27:00,1354,"excellent good investment, I have a manual model...i wear mine river fishing on big water, only took one nasty spill in a high flow to smarten up, dried off and drove straight to the store, eye opening experience  I'm interested in an automatic model for boat fishing...it sounds like the hydrostatic model is worth the few extra bucks, glad i came across this...great thread with solid feedback"
635903,mercman,2011-10-30 17:31:00,7054," I was actually flattered that someone cared enough to point out that i should buckle up. I do all the time now. Thanks Dan !!! I also find that it is less likely to irritate my neck if its is adjusted snuggly arround the waist. I keep mine in my rod locker,when not in use.Take the extra 10 seconds to untwist the straps.That way its ready to go next time you need it."
636096,Kayakmike,2011-10-31 12:05:00,20,"And KayakMike, good thoughts there, but I kinda like the idea of the self-inflating feature incase I bang my noggin on the way outta the boat and can't pull the ripcord myself.   That's definitely a worthwhile consideration.    However, I recommend double checking with the manufacturer and perhaps even coast guard/OPP at boat show etc....as that is in fact the distinction between life vest and pfd....a pfd is not rated to keep your noggin out of the water in the event of such a mishap.  If that is a major concern, I would take my time and do more research. "
636102,Roy,2011-10-31 12:26:00,13728,"I haven't had the time to read the entire thread this morning but that Mustang vest will definitely keep your head out of the water. Lew, I defy you to try to get your face in the water while wearing the inflated vest. There's nothing quite like peace of mind however. Buy the vest, take it to an indoor pool and fall in. It will cost you about $25 to do so but the expense will have been worth it. Just sayin'."
636104,oldphart,2011-10-31 12:37:00,665,~~~~I got it on my Christmas wish list.
636108,lew,2011-10-31 12:54:00,12766," I agree Roy, and there's an instruction video on the Mustang website that shows the vest being used but I can't get a link to work.  The vest inflates in the front plus a full collar that goes around the back of the neck also inflates. It shows the wearer floating on his back with his face held safely out of the water.  And for what it's worth, I've decided to take Tomcats advice and go with the Mustang 3153 with the Hydrostatic Inflator.   Sure hope I spelled everything correctly in that post"
636116,skeeter,2011-10-31 13:11:00,1907,"Lew, here is LeBarons add for the vest. I believe this is the one you were talking about.  • Neoprene Comfort Collar™ • Durable 420–Denier nylon construction • Safety inspection window: green indicates inflator is ready to use • 35 lb buoyancy when inflated can self–right a person in seconds • SOLAS reflective tape • Safety whistle • Backup oral inflation tube • D–Ring HIT ™ Auto Hydrostatic Activation • Provides excellent safety, designed for severe weather and requires minimal maintenance • 1F auto hydrostatic inflator with manual backup • SecureZIP™ closure withstands rigourous activity and is easy to repack • Heavy– duty coated nylon for increased durability • Lightweight, comfortable and compact • Fits over 16 years, weighing 36.3 kg (80 lb) and over • Size: Universal Adult, chest 76–132 cm (30”–52”) • Colours: Red/Black or Carbon/Black CODE: MD3153 CCG Approved  $ 225.45"
636118,lew,2011-10-31 13:17:00,12766,That's the one Dann and thanks very much.
635788,lew,2011-10-30 10:16:00,12766,"I'm starting to make out my Christmas Wish list for Santa and have decided it's time to catch up to the 21st century and get myself an auto-inflatible PFD  I like the features of this one but wondered if anyone is familiar with this particular model and has an opinion on it...good, bad or otherwise.  I don't like ordering stuff on-line and can get this one down in Oshawa.  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/recreational/deluxe-inflatable-pfd-automatic-activation-0?division=recreation"
635790,Roy,2011-10-30 10:26:00,13728,"Good choice Lew. I've had that one for 2 years now and I always wear it. Always. I keep my conventional aboard as well. With the auto inflate or manual inflate PFDs, you must be wearing it all the time if it's the only model you have in the boat. And by the way...I KNOW it works and it works well.  Edited to add: Don't go testing it every week though or it'll cost you a small fortune in re-arm kits."
635791,Big Cliff,2011-10-30 10:28:00,6899,I got one for Sue when we bought our new boat last year and she loves it. (haven't had to use it yet). The thing is so comfortable you forget you even have it on.  I also have an inflatable but mine isn't automatic. I can't tell you how many times I have come in from fishing and ended up walking up to the house with mine still on because you forget you are even wearing it. I think they are an excellent investment Lew.
635805,lew,2011-10-30 11:42:00,12766,"Thanks fellas, and if there's no negative reports about this model I'll go ahead and get it."
635807,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-30 12:06:00,336,
635809,lew,2011-10-30 12:11:00,12766," Your absolutely correct, my mistake"
635814,mrpike,2011-10-30 12:27:00,151,MY brother got one and two times it went off .  HE left it in the boat and it rained and the thing  went off. Not sure I would go with auto inflate. IT can get costly. I think a recharge kit is about twentyfive bucks.  But they work well.
635819,lew,2011-10-30 12:47:00,12766,"According to the website, it inflates after a tablet disolves but I was always under the impression it actually took a certain amount of water pressure for that to happen."
635822,mercman,2011-10-30 12:59:00,7054,"It would have to have been totally soaked, or it was not packed properly. I have worn mine in some wild rain, and no complaints. Only thing is i find the neck 'scratchy' but i'm sensitive"
635825,lew,2011-10-30 13:05:00,12766," One of the reasons I picked this model Paul is that they advertise a neoprene collar, supposedly to eliminate neck irritation."
635827,cowanjo,2011-10-30 13:06:00,249,"Great choice Lew this is the one I wear every time I fish, interesting even in summer it is light enough and doesnt make you too hot. automatic - i alwasy think is better, if i go in who knows what i hit myself on"
635829,GBW,2011-10-30 13:07:00,8460,here is what our buddy Dave has to say.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUuXOMAqS6U
635831,GBW,2011-10-30 13:11:00,8460,"PS, I forgot to say...  I want one too!"
635837,Grimace,2011-10-30 13:23:00,2020,I have one and I really like it.  No neck scratching issues have arisen for me.  It was a bit weird having it on when I first started wearing it as I did not wear any life jacket before.  After about four or five trips in the boat you can hardly notice it's presence.
635843,lew,2011-10-30 13:31:00,12766," Even now I seldom wear a jacket if somebody else is with me in the boat, but a couple years back I started to wear one when I was fishing alone. I find the regular jackets just too uncomfortable though to wear all day, specially in the hot summer.  These new inflatable ones seem like they'd be comfortable enough to wear all day, according to those who use them."
635845,mercman,2011-10-30 13:36:00,7054,"  God knows my neck is red enough as it is They are light and comfortable, and easy to store.   oh and BTW. Keep it buckled up or DanC will delete your post  Right Dan"
635852,Grimace,2011-10-30 13:41:00,2020,"  Same here Lew.  Once, when I was working the down riggers in rough water I couldn't help but think that all it would take was one good wave.  Then reading about those guys in the paper on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario sealed the deal for me.  Well who am I kidding, the bloody thing went on sale.  lol.  Enjoy your new purchase, you are making the right decision as it is a very comfortable product."
635854,tjsa,2011-10-30 13:43:00,1578,"I have the same one also and love it. Ordered it from Cabela's Canada for $275.00.  One thing though, don't be wearing it under a jacket if you go in as someone up here found out"
635855,lew,2011-10-30 13:44:00,12766," OK, I'm obviously missing something here Paul, but it'll definetely be kept buckled up anyways"
635857,lew,2011-10-30 13:47:00,12766," $220 at Gagnons in Oshawa Tom, plus $14 for shipping if I want."
635859,John,2011-10-30 13:52:00,2956, Good price Lew.  I bought two self inflating Cabelas brand last year and Barbara wears hers all of the time and Wray wore mine at Lakair in August. They both find them very comfortable to wear and forget they have them on.
635861,GBW,2011-10-30 13:56:00,8460,I can pick it up for you Lew if you want and hold it for you.  My folks place is near Fenlon Falls and I can give it to them to give to you.  PM me if interested
635866,danc,2011-10-30 14:05:00,4677," I bought the non self inflating model this past summer Lew. I was concerned about it inflating on its own if it got wet. I too suffered mild neck irritation, but solved this by making sure I had a shirt that went between the pfd and the back of my neck.  I noticed that Paul had his on, but not buckled up in a few of his photos and teased him that I would delete his posts if he didn't start buckling it up. Truth is that because it has to fit fairly snug, it is a bit of a pain to buckle up and I couldn't imagine having to do so under water if you went overboard. He now buckles it up.  Bottom line Lew. You'll not regret buying one. You'll wonder why you didn't buy one sooner."
635869,lew,2011-10-30 14:13:00,12766," Thanks Geoff, very generous offer, but when my daughter comes up here to visit she goes right past Gagnons and will be picking it up for me.  And Dan, I figured it was something like that. Didn't think you were quite as nasty as Paul portrayed you   :lol:"
635870,Kayakmike,2011-10-30 14:15:00,20,"   Food for thought....I have tested mine and found it does a great job of keeping you bouyant (chest and face out of water) but for that same reason I found it difficult to swim forward in, due to all the bouyancy...I deflated it a fair bit to be able to move forward more easily.  So that being said, I'm not sure if auto inflate is the way to go....I like mine manual...this way if something happens, I can try and swim back to the boat or kayak etc without having the jacket inflated and being impeded...perhaps making for a faster and smoother easier re-entry into the boat.  If I need the bouyancy...it's a simple pull.  Mine is an older model...would be interested to know if others have test inflated and found the same issue in trying to swim with one on.  I defintiely wish I had a collar model though.  My $0.02."
