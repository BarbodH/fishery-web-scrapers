Most know to try a small Flatfish, Kwikfish or Hot Shot now and then, because they work magic for steelhead that are completely turned off the standard roe/pink worm/fly stuff. Little CD3 countdown Rapalas (if you can find them) are also awesome for rainbows in streams. You can drop them back like a Flatfish, or cast and slowly retrieve across deep, slow pools.  In bigger water (like off the pier, or wading along a beach) small bass crankbaits work really well at times. Personal favourite are Shad Raps (shallow and deep versions, depending on the day) but original Fat Raps, Bomber Model A, and Norman Little N crankbaits all work well. On days when fish are particularly active, small Rattle Traps can be pretty good. And small Husky Jerks are always worth a try along the lake shore, off the pier, or in the frog water. Sometimes, when nothing else works, they can produce a few fish.  It gets boring drifting with a centrepin all the time, so some times it's fun to mix things up a bit."

Beat him like a rented mule with the pool cue and 100 lb powerpro."
