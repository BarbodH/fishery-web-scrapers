635994,ChrisK,2011-10-30 23:39:00,2772,"Well,the kid did it again this weekend going 1 for 4 . I caught one fish Saturday but Devon turned up the heat today and hooked 4 landing 1...Apparently he had a bad spool of fluorocarbon which caused two of the fish to brake him off. After changing leader material he hooks up and lands this big boy without any issues.  Guess its my turn to be the camera man for a change"

636024,ChrisK,2011-10-31 01:26:00,2772,"Yup,the kid seems to be a natural and yes I am proud of him. I remember when I met him the first time on the river he was only 9 years old and full of questions...I would look over my shoulder and he would be standing in the river with his rubber boots on as deep as they would allow him to go casting as far as he could into the pool with what ever he had at the time and determined to catch a fish. I just couldn't help myself but to go over and do what I could for him. This year he got some nice equipment from us regulars and now spends his weekends standing in the river with the boys fishing for steel and doing very well at it"

636070,Remastered,2011-10-31 04:08:00,143,Looks like he's on the right path. Just make sure he doesn't turn into one of those crazy people you see on some of the other forums!
