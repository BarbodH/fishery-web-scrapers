634821,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-27 17:09:00,0,"typically i will fish hard with one line, bouncing from hole to hole looking for active fish with a variety of tube jigs, buckshots, and spoons.  i will also typically have a tip up set with nothing but a live dace and just enough wait that it doesn't take 1/2 hour to get 50 feet down."
634994,fish-miester,2011-10-27 22:53:00,864,Northland buckshot and Lindy Rattl'n Flyer
635012,Sharkbait22,2011-10-27 23:30:00,297,"Which of the three has the best hooks?  Bad Boys, Meggs, or Little Foxy jig?  Bad Boyz seem the best to me, but I have problems finding them in stores. Otherwise Willaims and white tubes with stinger are great.  A lot of the fish come and committ to a lure presented correctly, regardless.  Move around and have a flasher. Also bought a couple Live Target shinners which look so real.  At $12 hope I don't loose too many."
635015,misfish,2011-10-27 23:37:00,29133,"Green monster. Wish I could find them again.     Second choice,Meegs."
635959,peter23,2011-10-30 21:40:00,95,do you guys usually tip your williams with minnows or just leave it plain?
635960,Terry,2011-10-30 21:43:00,14456,plain
635977,MCTFisher9120,2011-10-30 22:32:00,3761,I CANT WAIT TO GET OUT ICE FISHING!!!!!  Sorry I can't add to this post
635983,manitoubass2,2011-10-30 22:38:00,11391,This year I think my plan is to drop shot live bait for the most part. Maybe try some new spoons as well
636003,peter23,2011-10-31 00:08:00,95,"also what colour bad boyz/meggs should i get? (bright colours,naturalcolours)?? and what colour tube should i tip it with? (chartruese,natural)???"
636005,ckrb2007,2011-10-31 00:11:00,449,I've always had luck with green/black meegs tipped with a green micro tube or a chartruese/black tipped with a chartruese micro tube.
634622,peter23,2011-10-27 01:10:00,95,hey guysi know its a little early but i was just wondering what your more productive lures have been for lakers and whities in the past year or so? no need to give away too many secrets im just wondering what had been working for you for these species.
634625,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-27 01:13:00,10439,I have my best luck for lakers with williams whitefish spoons and for whitefish meegs/badboyz jigs tipped with a crappie tube/minnow.
634626,NAW,2011-10-27 01:15:00,4022,X2.  Small Williams hammered half and half.  With some minor customization.
634627,Terry,2011-10-27 01:19:00,14456,I like williams ice jig if they are active      and meggs or other jigs if they are inactive
634629,limeyangler,2011-10-27 01:26:00,5204,"1/8 jig...differing colors dependent on my mood as i dont think the fish give a damn with a live minnow will get walleye, pike, whitefish ,trout and crappie. sometimes the trout prefer white tube jigs...and whitefish prefer white micro tube jigs.  I have tried all sorts of other fancy shmancy lures ...but i always seem to start and finish a day with one of the above.  Thats not to say it is not worth buying and trying those other lures...sometimes the weirdest combinations work...but overall tube jigs and jig and minnows would be a more than adequate tackle box arsenal in my experience and opinion.   AND ITS NOT TOO EARLY....EVER!"
634650,Remastered,2011-10-27 02:09:00,143,Don`t forget different sizes of jigging raps. If you can peek through the hole make the jigging rap swim away from the fish it will then immediately attack it. No bait needed.
634660,OutdoorDan,2011-10-27 02:40:00,325,"Can't go wrong with a 2"" Williams half/half.  I don't like the hammered ones but a lot of guys prefer them..."
634662,OutdoorDan,2011-10-27 02:41:00,325," These are good, I would replace the bottom treble with one a size bigger though."
634666,limeyangler,2011-10-27 02:48:00,5204, OMG!!!!....i cant believe i forgot jigging shad raps...thanks Remastered...they are definitely a freekin awesome ice fishing lure!
634670,manitoubass2,2011-10-27 03:13:00,11391,"I like the jigging raps too. Most of the time I use jigs with minnows or smaller plastics. I've had some good fish on spoons as well, the Williams silver/pink in particular.  Limey forgot to mention how much he loves Lindy Darters"
634673,limeyangler,2011-10-27 03:38:00,5204, Lol Rick...those things are nothing short of FRAUDULENT!
634674,Remastered,2011-10-27 03:40:00,143,They are.
634700,fishindevil,2011-10-27 12:03:00,6254,"3 inch grub,on a dropper line below a 2inch williams half&half !!!! if you want to go deep use a swedish pimple instead of a williams 3/8 oz. deadly on anything that swims"
634707,mike rousseau,2011-10-27 12:32:00,4661,Northland buckshot... All sizes for all fish...  It's my top producer for every species...
634709,Jds63,2011-10-27 12:36:00,1365,"I also would agree, williams whitefish, white jig and minnow, meegs. However I find some colours do work better than others, like blue and silver never had much luck with chartreuse for lakers. Another method that always works is the spreader, always worth setting up.  One time i decided to use a giant gold williams whitefish (10 inch)and start ripping it up and down off the bottom to see if i could attract anything to my minnow setup on a another rod a couple of feet away, after a few minutes i see a big red flash on my sonar and feel a huge weight on the williams and began reeling ... well whatever it was i lost it (probably dull hooks) but it felt like the biggest fish i ever set into while ice fishing, that was several years ago up in the Temagami region, so I believe the big flashy spoons do get the lakers attention."
634717,ckrb2007,2011-10-27 13:01:00,449,Williams 1/2 & 1/2 hammered and dead sticking a white tube. Lipless cranks seem to be getting some attention the past year as well (Rapala clackin' rap or Live Target Golden Shiner).
634724,12footspringbok,2011-10-27 13:10:00,459,I hate the cold but I gotta admit I'm looking forward to ice fishing.  I do about 80% of my ice fishin on simcoe. Its a no brainer out there williams ice jig or a white tube 90% of the time. Over the past few years I've found its not the lure your using but HOW you use it.         I think I may try messin around with some different swim baits next year because I did have some pretty good sucess last year with them towards the end of the season. 
634726,BillM,2011-10-27 13:12:00,17367,"Half and half hammered Williams ice spoon for sure.  Although the key to catching Simcoe whities is to not sit over a school in inactive fish.  I don't care what lure you are using, if they aren't in the mood, you'll just be watching your graph all day."
634728,tonyb,2011-10-27 13:17:00,1637,"White Tubes are normally a Laker standby, but Whitefish crush 'em too...just harder to hook up as they have smaller mouths.  Williams ice jig catches everything as well...but it's light and doesn't stay as vertical as some other lures if you're fishing with multiple guys/lines in a small area like in a hut.  Large shiners on a tip-up should always be a consideration as well.  Jig one rod, set a tip-up with live shiner on another and whatever method produces best, double-up with that technique and you'll increase your catch rate"
634733,BillM,2011-10-27 13:27:00,17367,"Tony, add those little treble stingers guys use for walleyes to the end of your tubes"
634736,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-27 13:41:00,4399,Okay you all have a 10 minute misconduct for talking about icefish`n
634777,manitoubass2,2011-10-27 15:13:00,11391,"I've had luck jigging the Live Target Golden shiner, but it's been better quality fish and lower numbers. Same with the Clackin Rap, although to a lesser extent than the shiner.  @MuskyMike, that doesn't really surprise me. I haven't used them through the ice yet, but plan on it this year. I think I caught more fish on those baits then anything else this year, especially walleye.  EDIT: I was thinking of the Northland Buck Aroo Jigs"
634779,adempsey,2011-10-27 15:16:00,1498,I think this page sums it all up quite well:  http://www.fishingsimcoe.com/conservation/tackle-talk/artificial-baits
634792,Leecher,2011-10-27 15:49:00,7832,I'm suprise no one mention Little Foxee's.... they're great for lakers and whities.  I use the silver / blue and tip it with a white fish fry  Edited to add:  Another great lure I use is Mr.Champ tip with fish fry
634793,mike rousseau,2011-10-27 15:53:00,4661,  buck-a-roo jigs are good with 4-6 inch minnows and stinger hook for pike
