636238,GBW,2011-10-31 18:44:00,8460,"Or better yet, use one?  I want to get a better back-up of a back-up and at the price I can get it; it looks to be ok.  So has anyone used a new Shimano Sellus rod yet?"
636247,johnnyb,2011-10-31 19:02:00,3413,That's all Shimano wants to do is Sellus rods.  Man do they ever Sellus a lotta rods.
636248,adolson,2011-10-31 19:04:00,783," One for every lure!!! They should label them with the lure they're meant for - oh wait, they do."
636250,jedimaster,2011-10-31 19:14:00,3472,They look like they are in the 50-60 dollar range and look like they are a newer version of the voltare or whatever the one dave used to chatch a shark with. The guides look better though.
636251,kuhaman,2011-10-31 19:19:00,503,Took the words right outta my mouth
636252,manitoubass2,2011-10-31 19:24:00,11391," Are you referring to the Volteus? I was taking a look at them the other day, and it looks like a decent back up rod. The guides looked horrendously low budget and flimsy though.  Anyone on here use that rod? Thoughts?   "
636253,Remastered,2011-10-31 19:31:00,143," Gotta have one for drop shot, one for flippin, one for pitchin, one for crankin, even though it won't make a difference...  Screw that! I'm going to a bass tournament with my 20$ rod and reel!"
636258,adolson,2011-10-31 19:52:00,783," Yeah, I use the Voltaeus, and I love it. But I haven't used many other rods. All I can tell you is that it's a far, far better rod than the Ugly Stiks I've used."
636261,MCTFisher9120,2011-10-31 20:06:00,3761,"Come on down to Gagnon Sports. We have roughly 20 or so models in right now. There a nice rod for the money, ask for Mike, would love to meet some more OFNr's  Selling for $49.99 and $59.99"
636267,ohhenrygsr,2011-10-31 20:21:00,947,The Sellus is not a bad rod when you first look at it it matches the same colours as a chronarch OPPS in my opinion. I really like my 2012 Compre's. I use to be a Fenwick diehard till they stop producing the Techna's
636270,MCTFisher9120,2011-10-31 20:28:00,3761, My new debt yes  Na it's hard sometimes tho being around all that great stuff all day
636271,Harrison,2011-10-31 20:29:00,2202,"with your discount just grab it GBW.  However, if you are paying full price I'd do a bit more research and compare them to other brands in the price range."
636289,GBW,2011-10-31 20:58:00,8460,"rather then doing a lot of multi quotes (too lazy, HA) yes it is the new white one, it's in the low $ range, I have a voltaus (SP?) and funny enough it's a great rod.  so this is a rod for others to use (wife   ) if I don't like it.  Your right Phil, at the price I found it for I think I will..."
636346,manitoubass2,2011-10-31 23:42:00,11391," Thats good to hear. It felt good in the hand, and it's nice looking. Do you have any issues with the guides? Or am I just being too critical, lol.   "
636356,GBW,2011-11-01 00:12:00,8460,no issues casting at all with a spinning reel.  I love that it's cork and not eva and yes I did land my biggest musky on it.
636367,adolson,2011-11-01 00:28:00,783," Only issue with the guides is that PowerPro noise... So, no, no issues, at least not yet.  Again, I don't know how they stack up to other rods, but I've been considering buying a few as gifts and a second for myself to replace my already-replaced-now-a-backup Ugly Stik. I can cast further, it's thinner and lighter, I feel a lot more, has a lifetime warranty. Better in every way. Right now I feel like I don't need a fancy, expensive rod. I'm no tourney angler, though, and I have no doubt there are better rods out there. But I'm happy, and the difference is pretty big for me."
636395,manitoubass2,2011-11-01 00:59:00,11391,"Right on Dana and GBW! Thansk for the input.  I was hoping there was some good reviews on it, cause I am always in need of spares, and I got a $50 doller cert. I need to use up at Anglers Pro Shop. Gonna pare it up with an extra Okuma Avenger I have laying around begging to get some use.  Thanks again"
