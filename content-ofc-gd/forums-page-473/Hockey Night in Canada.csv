636056,otter649,2011-10-31 03:03:00,118,The female in question was Cassie Campbell but I find stating the obivious does not make one a NHL analysis. She compared her time being a player for a womens hockey team (no body checking) to NHL hockey situations does not relate well to most watching a very physical game between Boston & Montreal.She should stick to interviewing players off the ice imho.....
