636523,Miracon,2011-11-01 13:03:00,200,HH...make sure you let us know where they chose! It almost feels like a competition now! Haha!
636527,Headhunter,2011-11-01 13:15:00,5703,"I certainly will, but it may take some time as I know they are talking to everyone I have passed along... Thanks again all! HH"
636133,Headhunter,2011-10-31 13:54:00,5703,"Hey folks, My niece is getting married next fall and is looking for a ""resort"" in the Muskokas or any other central Ontario spot, that could accommodate the service and their guests. She is open to considering everything. I thought I'd pick all your brains for suggestions as to where to book. I know she has contacted the major players/resorts. I would appreciate any advice suggestions you may have. Thanks in advance! HH"
636137,woodenboater,2011-10-31 14:07:00,2277,not Muskoka but how about this place. Boated past it this summer and it kinda stood out  beautiful scenery and guests can hit pike and musky after the nuptials lol  http://www.sf-nipissing.com/
636138,GBW,2011-10-31 14:08:00,8460,my friend had his wedding at Eganridge Inn and Spa (Fenelon Falls area) and it was a very nice place.
636139,Billy Bob,2011-10-31 14:21:00,5865,My son just got married in July so I have a small feel for all the planning involved......first question would be......how many guest do they expect to invite.
636141,torco,2011-10-31 14:23:00,656,Well a wedding at Taboo could get a expensive fast. I remember we looked at doing a wedding in the Muskoka's and found that most places couldn't accommdate 150+ guests. Lots of great places around 80-120 guests if I remember correctly. We really liked Severn Lodge.
636143,Billy Bob,2011-10-31 14:29:00,5865,"At my son's wedding EVERYONE was from out of town including the couple getting married....they actually live about 40 miles south of Syracuse, NY where the wedding was held.....with EVERYONE getting rooms at the hotel that the wedding was held made it the best wedding I have ever been to....errrr...except mine of course...LOL"
636146,Headhunter,2011-10-31 14:33:00,5703,"Good question re numbers... I'll have to find that out! Thanks for your replies so far and if I may, please keep 'em coming! HH"
636149,Grimace,2011-10-31 14:37:00,2020,"Cleveland's House on Lake Rosseau is big resort that would do that type of thing.   I have no experience with them, just another place to check into."
636168,chuckymcd,2011-10-31 15:27:00,144,deerhurst? pretty nice place but would be expensive.
636176,fishing n autograph,2011-10-31 15:57:00,2540,The Briars on Lake Simcoe in Keswick is nice
636239,Headhunter,2011-10-31 18:45:00,5703,"Thanks guys, I am forwarding all suggestions to my niece... and she also sends along her thanks! HH"
636243,Spiel,2011-10-31 18:55:00,9065,"Am I invited?  Is ""Road Gravy"" going to be on stage?"
636308,HTHM,2011-10-31 22:03:00,4082,Kinda depends on the gift you're gonna bring don't it?
636364,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-01 00:26:00,4399,Cityhall and a large Pizza.  Put the money ya save towards a downpayment!!!
636381,John Bacon,2011-11-01 00:44:00,3277,"I stayed at Grandview back in the early 90's. It is a beautiful place, but it won't be cheap."
636383,workwear,2011-11-01 00:48:00,592,rocky crest golf and country...
636387,muskymike,2011-11-01 00:53:00,772,"Try Christies Mill Inn and Spa. Its up in Port Severn, small, yet nice. We got married there, had about 80 people only as even Christies gets pricey after a few people are added. We had a great experience with them though, and the food was incredible.  www.christiesmill.com"
636390,Miracon,2011-11-01 00:55:00,200,Fern Resort in Orillia is a nice place! Not sure about pricing or numbers though.
636472,Billy Bob,2011-11-01 09:29:00,5865,The  BEST place to get married IMHO.........   SIN CITY USA
636475,Big Cliff,2011-11-01 09:48:00,6899,"Here is one that might be worth looking into, it is a beautiful place and they have a chaple right on the resort.  Viamede"
636485,cranks bait,2011-11-01 11:16:00,721,"I used to work at Viamede, not a bad spot.  There was no church on site then, the one in the picturelooks like one that was about 1/2 hour away?  Mind you this was also 22 years ago...If it's a small wedding their was also the Church on the Rock on Stoney Lake, I always liked that.  As for Deerhurst, I do not recommend them.  I stayed there a couple of years ago.  $300.00 for the night.  Had to park at the airport because their parking was full.  I was responsible for trying to figure out how to get to and from my truck, they would not shuttle.  That's just the beginning of my brutal experience with them."
636489,Big Cliff,2011-11-01 11:39:00,6899," There is a church on the site now but I'm not sure how long it has been there. It was also taken over by new managers about a year or so ago, very nice young man, Ben and he has made a lot of upgrades to the place. I was there last summer and it was beautiful and seemed to be very well run."
636495,Bernie,2011-11-01 11:50:00,3190,"Hey Joe, how about they do it at my place? The money spent would pay our fishing trips for a long time.  Would they be OK with a big tent?"
636496,Billy Bob,2011-11-01 11:51:00,5865,And I can cook....
636521,Headhunter,2011-11-01 13:00:00,5703,"Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I have passed them along to my niece. They are looking at approximately 80 people at this point... Bernie, appreciate the offer, but I don't think you can accomodate 80... plus, I wouldn't get much ""wedding stuff"" done there as I would be out in the boat catching fish! Thanks again all... and thanks for the offer to cook BB! I would surely enjoy a wedding dinner of Crappie or Perch! HH"
