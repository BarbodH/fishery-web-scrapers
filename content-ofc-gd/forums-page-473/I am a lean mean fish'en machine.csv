635328,manitoubass2,2011-10-28 18:29:00,11391,"After you've read all the info you can find and purchase your tackle, just get out there and fish. Nothing works better, lol.  The one thing you'll notice about bass fishing with other anglers is that most will have there own styles of fishing. So pick up what you can, get out and fish as much as you can and develope your own style of bass fishing.  The good thing is bass can be pretty easy to put in the boat or on the shore, most times of the year.  A good way to build your confidence is to troll and pitch baits at the shoreline. This will give you a good feel for your baits action and which baits to select as well, and how to vary your retrieves, fish different depths etc.  I wouldn't start out deep though, if it's possible to you. Start n more simple techniques like burning spinner baits and shallows cranks as apposed to drop shotting 50 FOW.  Just my two cents...  And don't be afraid to post questions on here about bass fishing either, after all, muskymike could have probably wrote a book this fall after all the questions he asked about steelhead etc .  Good luck!"

Dt6's, Dt 10's, crawfish patterns, minnow patterns, perch patterns.  Some Husky Jerk style baits.  Swim jigs, crawfish trailers, tubes, tube hooks, drop shot hooks, barrel swivels, scum frogs(or any other topwater frogs), wide gap hooks in various sizes, Swammers, 4"", 6"" worms in various colors, Shaky heads jigs, spinnerbaits in various sizes and colors.  And fish with a purpose. Bass are active at different times, and moving frequently to locate active fish is a great way to find fish.

635043,mercman,2011-10-28 00:49:00,7054,"Hey Skip. Understand the fish you are after.Small and largemouth are 2 completely differnt types of fish.They dont hunt the same way, and they dont live in the same types of environment.There are literaly dozens of sites on the internet that specialize in Bass fishing.LMB are probably the easiest to catch and dumbest fish in the water.Drop a hook with anything on it, close to a hiding Largie,jiggle it, and he will try to eat it."
635090,Skipper D,2011-10-28 02:40:00,1970,"If i was going to fish bass which would be the best type of rod to use , how many pound test . which is the best lure to use ?"
635094,bigmac1984,2011-10-28 03:03:00,193,"You will most likely get alot of differing opinions on this as bass fishermen and women all have different ways they prefer. The best thing to do is be as versatile as possible, and learn new/different techniques.  For smallmouth, I use mostly 3 techniques, one of which I learned how to do this year and that is dropshot. It seems like a very easy technique, but most guys will tell you there is some skill involved. I use this technique when the bite seems to be slow, or I can see the fish deep on my sonar. When I start the day, I use something close to the surface and moving fast, usually a white spinner bait or a topwater lure. Finally, you can't beat a tube or goby imitating bait bounced off bottom, no matter the conditions, this technique will often work.  For Largemouth, I'll also use spinnerbaits to start, and the colour green seems to be the ticket for them. If you are in really thick cover (usually a good spot to find Largemouth), something texas rigged or a Jig with a trailer to imitate a crayfish can be the ticket. Nothing beats throwing a topwater frog around lilly pads for largemouth, the bites are explosive and quite possibly the most fun you'll have bass fishing IMO.  Many people have already said this board is a great resource to learn, there are lots of good reads on here, lots of good posts from the summer you can read up on.  As far as rod/reel setups go, again you will get differing opinions on here. For me, I use a spinning rod 7'2 Medium Power Extra Fast action for dropshotting, a spinning rod 7' medium power Extra fast action for tubes, and a 7'7 Medium Heavy power, fast action baitcasting rod for the spinner baits. On my 7'2 dropshot rod, I run 8lb straight flourocarbon line, but alot of guys use 15-20lb braid with an 8-10lb flourocarbon leader attatched to it. I use 20lb braid on my 7' medium because on occastion I use that for jerkbaits and like how the braid feels. When I use a tube, I'll tie a flourocarbon leader on that. The baitcast setup is straight braid, 30lb.  Rod/Reel setup for largemouth, I go heavy because of where these fish live and where I primarily target them, the slop. When from fishing, I use a 7'6 Heavy Power, Extra fast action with 65lb test braid. This allows for powerful hooksets and to pull them from the slop. When flipping/pitching a jig or texas rigged worm/craw, I also use a 7'6 Heavy Power, extra fast action with 65lb test braid. For spinnerbaits, I use the same setup as above.  If you are serious about learning to bass fish (and it sounds like you are), the internet is a powerful tool. My opinion is to start out using only a few techniques and getting good at them. The best thing is to read up on how these fish react to weather patterns in the summer, and adjust your technique to the weather conditions you are going to fish.  Good luck, you have until June 30th, 2012 to read up and learn up!!"

The best bass fishing of the year is here now at our front door.  Learn to drop shot and use 3/8 oz wieght.  find 30ft of water in the bay and catch 5 pound plus smallies.  Of all the times of the year I am going to miss being a non fisherman it is now!!!  Practice makes perfect.  Go try some stuff and find some good water.  It is there but you have to find it.  Go out with someone.  Nobody is going to give away exact secrets on a forum.  You need to try some stuff. If it works, stick with it.  If it doesn't, try something new. If you have a couple of each of the lures I mentioned above and you use them properly, you will catch smallies. good luck"

635207,GBW,2011-10-28 14:26:00,8460,"He doesn't use the multi quote option, that's why.  OK Ron, here goes.  At some point you will end up with all of this (minus the bottom case) to chase those little green buggers.   By far the Strike King Rage Tail Shad (see image) is one of the best soft plastic lures out there for bass.  You can rig it for topwater or on a jig like shown.  If using it on a jig, just cast out and slowly swim it back to you.  For rod and reel.  Well that depends on what you want to spend and everyone will tell you many, MANY different brands and ones to use.  The best way to pick a good one is to go to a store that has a lot to pick from and hold each one in your hand as it's a matter of what feels right to you.  then grab a rod and do the same but just make sure that it's balanced.  most bass people use a 6'6"" to 7' rod in a Med, Med/Heavy or Heavy action with a fast tip.  It just depends on how you are going to fish.  heavy cover?  heavy action rod.  drop shot?  med. action rod.  it just depends.  now you know why all the bass folks have so many rod's and reel's...
