636057,otter649,2011-10-31 03:08:00,118,Enjoyed the video as well as the game despite The Bruins attempting to goon things up when they are losing which happens quite a bit now with Boston's style of play being dictated from above by Cam Neely & down through coaches and their players.......
636265,F7Firecat,2011-10-31 20:20:00,347,"Big difference from now to back in the spring where the Bruins got away with all the cheap shots throughout the playoffs, the other night not so much so."
