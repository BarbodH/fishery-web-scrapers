634575,Paulus,2011-10-26 22:36:00,522,"Excited by the recent rainfalls, as well as all the reports of successful outings, I eagerly awaited today.  I knew that, with my shift in T.O. starting at noon, I would have time to hit one of my favourite small rivers by daybreak.  When I got there, it was low and clear, despite all the 70+mm that have fallen in the past week. And the only vestige of last night's rain was a greenish tinge to the water, with about 2ft of visibility.  Didn't matter though. They were in.  It wasn't a bunch of chromers, but I went 2 for 5 in the first hour between 7:45 and 8:45. The first was a smaller hen, probably no more than 3lbs. I caught her on one side of the river. After I released her, I changed color on the roe bag and tossed it to the other side. One drift, two drifts and down goes the float! After a surprisingly long fight, this little scrapper was on the bank.      Within that first hour I had one missed giant take, another big take that tore a roe bag clean off and one where the fish immediately rolled and spit the hook   . For the next two hours I pretty much eeked out a meagre existence in the NE wind and the drizzle. I did ok, though, missing a small hen, and a male about 6lbs - I had him almost to shore for a pic, then he pulled the hook...believe me?  Then... it was almost time to leave ...  As I was fishing a slow, deep section my float did the best thing it could do... the sunfish nibble. You may know this one. It means there's either a goby or a smolt, OR there's a very nonchalant - and therefore big - mature fish sniffing at my bait. The float did its little dance and seemed to halt, so I pulled the trigger - whiffffff! ; air.    I reset my hook and roe bag, and poked a salmon egg. Sweet juice started to flow... I cast up again...  No more than 5 feet of drifting and the sunfish tickles start again... they stop. Two more feet of drift. I'm getting really tense now. They start again, get a little more serious and stop; but so does the float, and it goes ever so gently down.  BOOM!   Fish on!  Log! A freaking log but; no! It's moving.    Head shakes, only a few. Then it was on. I fought this guy up and down the river, knowing he was a tank - Tank, with a capital T. I had to disturb the guys fishing on the other side of the river, because this fish ran up there like a train. I got him to come back over, then purposely maneuvered him to head down river, where there was better gravel to make a landing. All in all, after about 10 minutes worth of battling, the big buck lay on the bank at my feet.  Sweet, big, prime, dime bright fish. He's worth a whole day and then some.   (p.s. for a better perspective on size, the handle on my rod is 21"" long and the reel has a 5"" diameter, where his beak is now is at about the 33"" mark - trust me I measured it afterwards lol!)   I Feel GREAT right now  p.-"
634580,Ralph Field,2011-10-26 22:51:00,1018,Nice fish and reel! Doesn't it feel great when a plan comes together.
634582,BillM,2011-10-26 22:57:00,17367,"Dude, there's water on your lens  :)"
634589,Paulus,2011-10-26 23:11:00,522, I know! He kicked up a splash just as I was taking a pic.   lens cap won't open now... dunno what I'm gonna do...  p.-

634687,spincast,2011-10-27 09:17:00,3279,"nice fish, congrats. Put the camera in a bag of rice for a couple days. the a drop of oil on the mechanism. hopefully that'll fix 'er up"
634732,johnnyb,2011-10-27 13:24:00,3413,Awesome report....loved the suspense while that float was doin the dance....gorgeous fish!!!!!
634744,strakey,2011-10-27 14:02:00,78,Nice fish Paulus........I'd throw my camera in the drink willingly to tackle one of those beasts.  
634759,cuzza,2011-10-27 14:33:00,467,Great report and nice fish! I HAVE to get out this weekend!
634824,Spiel,2011-10-27 17:25:00,9065,You just gotta be happy with that!
634829,frozen-fire,2011-10-27 17:47:00,542,Fantastic chomer!  Loved the description.
634856,I'mHooked,2011-10-27 18:47:00,525,"Wow, great looking fish! Great read as well. Thanks."
635093,Paulus,2011-10-28 02:59:00,522,"Thanks for the great comments everyone. I haven't shared too many stories lately, but I knew that this one would be well received. It's easy to tell a good story when you're heart's in it .    The oil is probably the next step, then. The camera works fine, but it's that little lens cap thingy that won't open all the way. I'll give it a week or so, and if it hasn't corrected itself I'll try it. Thanks for the advice, spincast!  p.-"
635777,Paulus,2011-10-30 04:24:00,522,"Here's another pic of his other side. Notice the fresh huge lamprey bite, as well as the collection of older ones. I hope he fathers at least this year's generation of fish. They'll be champs!    p.s. See Solopaddler's post about the Demarco reel, if you like the one you see in these pics"
635830,Pangle,2011-10-30 13:11:00,64,Great fish!  That lamprey mark looks deep. I love getting out before work as well.  Hopefully this week.
635836,solopaddler,2011-10-30 13:23:00,8605,Sweet fish buddy!
635840,jpfishing,2011-10-30 13:26:00,53,"Paulus,  Great pictures and great fish.  I always enjoy reading your posts, the detail makes it seem as if i was there, great story telling.  Looking forward to reading more in the near future.  "
