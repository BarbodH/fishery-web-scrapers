593970,Ziki,2011-06-17 15:48:00,128,as the title says I'm building a transducer mount for my canoe. I am planning on using some type of lightweight rod that is either easily removable or can rotate on a point to remove the transducer from the water for shallow water and portaging.  Looking for the best place to place the transducer (I am thinking directly behind the canoe to reduce drag but that might give me a delayed reading?)  Any other tips or pictures would be great.  Thanks guys!

593974,Bondar,2011-06-17 16:15:00,817,i would mount it in the canoe and shoot in through the Fibreglass .....

It was a T shape contraption that clamped along the gunnel and hung down. The nifty part was he added a spring the leading edge of it so if we hit a log or beached the boat, the transducer lay back without harm. I hadn't thought of that in years...good luck.  Dave"
593985,NAW,2011-06-17 17:32:00,4022,Mine is mounted on a peace of thin aluminum.  I use it on my 14' boat too.  Held on with a c-clamp.
593992,camillj,2011-06-17 18:24:00,1988,Mine was $22.00 at BPS ... works great .. fully adjustable ... 100% reliable ... has lasted me over 10 years already .... and looks purdy ... just sayin
594042,jediangler,2011-06-17 23:07:00,1923,"If you are going to do a hang over the side mount, I'd put it where you can reach it from your seated position. This way you can clear weeds off of it without having to stop and get out. My kayak is a hybrid that is essentially a single canoe that you propel with a kayak paddle and I can reach my transducer by dropping my hand over the gunnel."
594067,shane,2011-06-18 00:57:00,652,"When I had mine, I had my transducer mounted on a short piece of 1x3 which had  a 4 inch suction cup attached on the other side of it.  I would just stick it to the side of the canoe right beside me. Worked good. Used it the same way on my buddies aluminum boat."
