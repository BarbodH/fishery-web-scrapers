594309,Steve_R,2011-06-19 11:42:00,81,Hi Guys. Just wanna get your thoughts on the Pflueger Patriarch magnesium reel. Has anyone ever fished one before? Is it worth the 2 bills they want for one. Im about to buy one and just wanted your thoughts on the reel.

594326,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-19 13:10:00,2690,"If it is as reliable as the President, and, the Arbor (still can't believe how much I love that reel) I'd say yes.  I guess the question is how does it stack up against the Shimano Stradic CI4."
594331,2jack2,2011-06-19 13:16:00,92,"if you are willing to spent that kind of money, then you should look at the Daiwa or Shimano reel."
594333,blarg,2011-06-19 13:34:00,289,"I am looking at a new rod/reel now as well, I was thinking of a shimano crucial and stradic 2500FI, i would be willing to spend more, it's just tough to know where diminishing returns makes it not worth the cost."

594337,blarg,2011-06-19 14:21:00,289,"Since were on the subject i am wondering what is the fuctional difference between a shimano crucial labelled as a drop shot rod vs one that isn't, i like the handle design on the drop shot models more."
594345,Keenan,2011-06-19 14:49:00,59, I have a Pflueger Patriarch. Love the reel it's so light. no complaints yet. I think it's worth the 2 bills.
594348,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-19 15:39:00,0,i heard the patriarch was an incredible reel but i opted for the stradic CI4 because shimano's warranty has such a good reputation on OFC.
594352,atvaholic,2011-06-19 16:06:00,271," X2. I played around with the patriarch at the store, and it looked like an awesome reel. Super light and well built. I went with the CI4 for the same reason above.  So far I have not been disappointed."
594360,Bondar,2011-06-19 16:51:00,817,"i liked the drag better on the Patriarch vs the Ci4 and it is lighter than the ci4,   Patriarch comes with a spare spool if that matters to you Ci4 does not.  I think the reel is to new to give a quality review on its durability but i'm yet to hear anythng bad about them .  I own Ci4's though lol tough to beat a shimano"
594379,Bob Devine,2011-06-19 19:08:00,251, I have an idea of of where a combo like that is on the bottom of Lake St. Clair... whoops!  I GPSd the area but no luck yet.
