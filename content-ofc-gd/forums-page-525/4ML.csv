594051,GBW,2011-06-17 23:48:00,8460,"Well considering I cannot make it to the Lakeair G2G (as well as a few others can't) I figured I would get my father's day gift out on 4 mile lake this Sunday.  So right now I know that Dave (dontrocktheboat) will be there and we will be fishing for sure.  But young_one might be able to go and Sinclair might be able to go too.  Those guys and another buddy on the lake might be there (just not sure if Albert is able to get out as well).  If young_one does come he might bring his boat (he might not need it if I put my big boat in though) so if anyone is in the area and would like to learn the lake or just get out and fish let me know.  I can provide you the addess to the boat launch and my cell so you can follow us around all day and or try your own thing.  Either way, guys (Will and Adam) let me know if you read this and can make it.  I plan to take off from here between 8:30 and 9:00 (or when ever my wife gets back from her run) and fish till 4 or 5PM.  Have a good weekend all.  Geoff"
594055,GBW,2011-06-18 00:15:00,8460,"Hey Adam,  Not to worry, we can get out around the Canada day weekend for a bit maybe?  If not another time then.  I hope it's not as windy as last week cause I don't want to wear my rain gear again on a hot and sunny day (well, that's what they are calling for now).  I just know the 2 or 3 hot spots to check ASAP...  As for the jig, I think I did keep the black one.      I just hope the slot stick get's used again and this time I AM going to bring my musky stuff as well."
594084,GBW,2011-06-18 02:07:00,8460,"Adam's out (but I'm still taunting him).  Will, not sure yet.  Dave's in.  Albert, not sure yet as I haven't heard back yet.  Anyone interested?  If I have to put the 19' in I will (but gas..$) to be a nice host.  Let me know as I'm home tomorrow all day doing yard work."
594208,busrayman,2011-06-18 20:16:00,1,Sent you a pm since it was a giant wall of text
594260,GBW,2011-06-19 01:39:00,8460,I got it and replied.  Let me know as you are FAR from this lake.
594321,GBW,2011-06-19 12:49:00,8460,getting ready to go!  So if you see this boat (look at avatir pic) it's me so say hi.
594419,GBW,2011-06-20 01:06:00,8460,"So I got there to hook up with Dave with 30 min to spare (and we needed it) and we took off right waay to go fish for some pickereye's.  talk about big blue sky sunny day!      Needless to say our first 3 spots were 'fish-less'  With bass season not open yet we decided to just try anything we could for perch/pickereye/musky and we threw everything.  Here's Dave (dontrocktheboat) chirping me saying her's going to get the bigest fish of the day.   Not even a few minutes after that he get's this ""beast"" for the day...   So we decide to hit the North end of the lake where it is shallow and we know musky are there.  I have my stuff ready to go for some SKI action and Dave have a OOS bass on and yell's ""Geoff, there is a nice one for you!"" so I toss my big bucktail spinner bait past it and this Big'N turns and follows...  doen't take.  In fact it got spooked and took off.      So I cast again to where it went to and it turned back and follwed again and again this time as it got closer it spooked and bolted.  Needless to say no pickereye's were harmed in todays fishing just a few rockbass, perch and OOS SMB but all in all Dave and I have a FUN TIME!  He's pretty good for a 'one legged bandit' at times being the anchor and net man...  Cheers.  Geoff"
