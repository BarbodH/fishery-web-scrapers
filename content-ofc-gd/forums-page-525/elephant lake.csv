594432,derrickt,2011-06-20 01:43:00,5,just wondering if anyone knows how the bass fishing is on elephant lake.
594475,jediangler,2011-06-20 03:02:00,1923,It's been real good in the past. I haven't fished there since 2002 when we caught only pike on a musky weekend. We caught big smallies and largies on musky bucktails as incidental catches from 1991.
