So much happens in a year it seems. Our daughter is now 17 months and we just bought our first home. CRAZY!!!  Here it is...  My gear for this session.     As I rode my bike down the path, I noticed this guy out of the corner of my eye. It's the largest I've seen behind my place to date.       It wasn't the only creature to keep me company. These three didn't have an issue with sharing some space.     In contrast to the natural elements around me, planes constantly were flying over my head.     And yes...Some Carp were feeding and willing to take some flies once again.       As a side note: The Pontoon made it's first float last week!!! Great day Fidel (Highdrifter).       I hope you enjoyed. Until next time,  Laszlo"
