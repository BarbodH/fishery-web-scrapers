This was all filmed from 6am to 2pm today and it was quite an interesting day weather wise.  Started off overcast, then a bit sunny, then a storm, then back to sunny...anyways here it is!  <iframe width=""853"" height=""510"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/8mItm11atgo?hd=1"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Equipment Used: Canon EOS 1D mk IV Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM GoPro Hero"
