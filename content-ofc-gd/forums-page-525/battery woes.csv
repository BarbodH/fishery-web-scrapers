594036,archer379,2011-06-17 22:25:00,277,last spring i bought 2 new factory seconds trolling motor batterys. Later on in the summer they didnt seem like they were holding much of a charge. I took them back the place i bought them (my work is one of there biggest costmers) he kept them fro a couple of days toped up the water chargerd them ran them down and charged them back up and said they were fine. So i thought it may be a bad conection someplace rewired it with a new plug. The rest of the year all was great. fast forward to this year have only had the boat out twice. the first time out the trolling motor was weak brought it home cleaned all the connections. Second time all was good. Was just out cleaning things a bit and bumped the swich the trolling motor seem slow for the setting. Grabed the volt meter one battery was 12+ volts the other one was 3.25 volts. they are both hooked to a onboard charger and were both up last weekend when I checked them. I think i need one new battery as the warrenty is gone can i replace just one since they are still fairly new or should i buy 2
594044,Billy Bob,2011-06-17 23:17:00,5865,You should really replace both.....but you didn't get your monies worth on those two......could be a bad cell in that battery but have you thought about a different brand.  Bob

594058,GBW,2011-06-18 00:24:00,8460,"If you have the coin right now to get 2 then do so and stick to the big name ones.  then keep the other as a backup and keep it well maintained as you might need it as a cranking one as a back up one day.  as for the bad unit.  keep it too and fill it up with distiled water and run something to drain it then charge it and drain it and charge it again.  you never know, it might come back."

594123,archer379,2011-06-18 10:29:00,277, just sent you a EMAIL THANKS
594130,Fisherman,2011-06-18 11:10:00,7201,"I really don't think ford makes batteries and if they retail for $190 that's mad, and for $150, that's still mad.  Go to Total Battery and get a Gp 27DC for around $110. Whoops, my bad, didn't see ""pair"""
594135,Roy,2011-06-18 11:24:00,13728,There are Ford Motorcraft labeled batteries. I believe Percher is kindly offering to sell both for $150.
594142,Bernie,2011-06-18 12:13:00,3190,That is a pretty good deal on a pair of 27's. Good 27 series batteries are around 140 bucks each.
