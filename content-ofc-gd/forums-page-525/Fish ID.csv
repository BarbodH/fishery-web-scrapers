They were slim like a minnow (1.5"" long) with an orange/red head with a brownish orange body. They were pretty fast moving and stayed in the current so it was hard to get a good look at them. Anybody seen these before or have an idea what they are?"
594502,fishing,2011-06-20 03:57:00,167,Gold fish?
594507,Banger68,2011-06-20 04:17:00,157,Don't think they were goldfish. Every time I've seen released goldfish they kept their rounder profile and stayed in still water. These were slim like a minnow and were staying in the current.  Hope they wern't goldfish as there was a school of 20-30 of them.

594599,dave524,2011-06-20 14:40:00,4508,"Some of the dace species have some orange/red on them, size and location that would be my best guess."
594608,ehg,2011-06-20 15:04:00,2666,I think you saw creek chubs. They are all over upper stretches of rivers. Caught many while going for brookies or resident browns. When they are spawning they get reddish orange stripe right down the length of body. 
594634,Banger68,2011-06-20 15:53:00,157,"We have a ton of Chub in the area. They are the right shape, but the whole head was orange. I've been up there for 10 years and never seen these before. That orange in the pic is the right colour though. Maybe the same fish with more colour?"
594635,Jen,2011-06-20 15:55:00,833,My guess would be Rosyface Shinner - The spawning male has an orange or red head and a light red belly where as the spawing females are paler red.  
594642,Banger68,2011-06-20 16:06:00,157,Thanks for the input guys. I'm back up there in a couple weeks. Hopefully they are still in colour and I'll send the little guy after them with his net.
