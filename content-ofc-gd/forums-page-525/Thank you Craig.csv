593677,Bernie,2011-06-16 14:59:00,3190,A couple months ago Craig asked me if he could put my little engine fixup in his magazine. Sure thing! Finally had a look at the magazine today. Nice layout! Thanks again.
593766,Headhunter,2011-06-16 18:45:00,5703,Congrats Bernie! Is there an on-line version we could have a look at? HH
593780,craigdritchie,2011-06-16 19:36:00,1586,"Hi Bernie,  Glad you like the layout, and thanks again for sharing your pics. I'm sure the readers will enjoy it. I only just saw the final product myself the other day, as I've been away at the Korea International Boat Show (click here for pics).  Headhunter - it will show up online eventually, but for now we want people to go out and buy the actual paper magazine, rather than read it online for free. That's how we pay the bills, after all.  Cheers"
593976,fishnsled,2011-06-17 16:24:00,3520,I'll have to grab a copy Bernie. Congrats! Can I get an autograph??
594015,Bernie,2011-06-17 20:20:00,3190,Sure thing Will. I have to practice making an X first.
594016,fishnsled,2011-06-17 20:25:00,3520,"  Make sure you have it perfected by September, I better get an extra copy just in case you mess up the first one."
594018,Bernie,2011-06-17 20:29:00,3190,Days start getting shorter soon Will. September will be here before you know it.
594021,fishnsled,2011-06-17 20:33:00,3520,True enough Bernie. I can't wait.
594062,danc,2011-06-18 00:33:00,4677,The motor refurb's that you do should be in national geographic Bernie. Absolutely amazing work.
