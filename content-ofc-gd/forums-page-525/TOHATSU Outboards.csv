555553,TennesseeGuy,2011-02-26 01:19:00,957,www.onlineoutboards.com  Try this.  Or send your email address by PM.  The store is in my town.  I'm considering buying a Tohatsu.  They are good.  They make small Mercs & Nissans.
555559,mercman,2011-02-26 01:40:00,7054,  http://www.marineeng...e-outboards.htm   30hp and less are made by tohatsu
555563,love2fishhave2work,2011-02-26 02:04:00,212,"The Merc is the Tohatsu as is the Nissan 9.8.  Same engine. Tahatsu makes it. I did all this research last year and ended up buying a Nissan from a dealer in Mississauga who imports them from the US.  Saved about $400 over anywhere you could get it in Ontario.  New with full warranty.  If you want me to find his contact info, let me know."
555570,cowanjo,2011-02-26 02:32:00,249,These were in Aust before I left no infalted tag in fact were really the cheap model - salt water tough as all hell. I had one for six years - still remeber it well. Maybe it was my first boat and motor
555740,mercman,2011-02-26 22:02:00,7054,"These motors were represented today at the Montreal Fishing show. I took a look at them, and they seem like good solid motors.The 2.5HP kicker i was looking at was 400 bucks. not bad"
555790,craigdritchie,2011-02-27 00:25:00,1586,"Tohatsu have been making outboards for decades, mainly for other brands (including Sears and Eaton's, at one time). As others have noted, they continue to make smaller outboards for other major brands, and they make parts for still other engines. The first Tohatsu branded motors showed up in Canada in the early 80s, I believe.  It's a good product."
555795,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-27 00:40:00,3761,This thread has sparked my interest in a new motor again. Can anybody share a dealers location in/around Ontario?
555821,Old Man,2011-02-27 01:16:00,822,The company has been around since 1922 and has been making outboards since 1956.

555829,Michael_Brown,2011-02-27 01:32:00,411,  http://www.mcgregorbaymarina.com/   These are very good motors. We have one as a tagged fish prize for the Rice Lake Spring Fishing Festival provided by McGregor Bay marine. If the tagged fish is not caught during the festival we will be drawing a lucky participant and giving away a new 9.8 Tohatsu motor.
555875,SBCregal,2011-02-27 04:36:00,688,pretty sure pisces marine in oakville carries them as well piscesmarine.ca
555884,pidge,2011-02-27 05:43:00,438,"Dont know if its pisces marine, but the place on 3rd line south of the QEW in Oakville. I myself grabed a Nissan 5hp inboard tank last fall. Cant wait to hook her up to the porta bote this summer."
555885,SBCregal,2011-02-27 05:47:00,688,yep...that'd be pisces
555904,pikehunter,2011-02-27 12:33:00,1659,"I'll third that. Just S. of the overpass, left side up on the hill. Nissan is the same motor."
594335,brkygetr,2011-06-19 14:00:00,425,Was just doing a search on these motors and found this thread....most of whats talked about are the smaller horsepower motors. Can anyone add any input about the 60+ hp motors??? I have been looking now for over a year (all companies) and found a some pretty good deals on these motors. This makes me a little wary though? Any thoughts?  Dale
594350,Mike the Pike,2011-06-19 15:46:00,3421,I think Mercury or Yamaha.Merc there is a dealer almost every where.  I love my Yamaha though and this will be my choice of brand always.
