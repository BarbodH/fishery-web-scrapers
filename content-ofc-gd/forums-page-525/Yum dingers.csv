Now how would you hook them i was thinking about a number 1 plastic worm hook but it seems alittle big...l mostly do river fishing for smallies when the season opens..."
594012,bdox,2011-06-17 20:08:00,329,"If you're fishing for smallies, you should be wacky rigging them on a #1 work hook, or dropshotting them."
594013,manitoubass2,2011-06-17 20:12:00,11391,"I use them for walleye and smallies sometimes. Sometimes I jig retrieve them off bottom, just on a 1/4oz jig head. Other times I wacky rig it on a jig head, cast into the current and work it back to shore.  I've fished them weightless on a Gamakatsu wide gap worm hooks in the rapids for smallies later in the summer. This method works well in the weeds as well. Sometimes I'll use the same hooks but weighed to get them down in the current.  There good baits, use your imagination, and I'm sure you'll catch fish"
594030,Dan668,2011-06-17 21:57:00,1120,I use them on a wacky rig.
594047,Fang,2011-06-17 23:28:00,1330,Take those back. Small Senkos do not catch fish. Especially in Temagami
594050,Garry2Rs,2011-06-17 23:43:00,1425,I caught tons of SMBass on brown 3 inch worms in the Kawarthas.
