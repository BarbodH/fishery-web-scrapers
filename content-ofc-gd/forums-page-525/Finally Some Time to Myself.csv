Decided to go after Bluegill because they like to cooperate. Found a nice spot and set up for a couple of hours of none stop action. They can be a lot of fun on ultra light gear. Here is some pictures of the larger ones, then the fillets being marinated, cooked and ready to be devoured by my wife and I."

593275,Rod Caster,2011-06-15 13:23:00,5784,"Ya, that looks great!  I like the ""because they cooperate"" haha. Sometimes it's nice to know you'll come home with dinner."
593289,jimmer,2011-06-15 14:21:00,2730,"Very simple. Marinate boneless fillets in your favourite spice (I used curry, cumin and thai spice). Saute peppers, onions and tomatoes in olive oil or margarine. Add a tablespoon of peanut butter and thai spices (actually whatever you like). Mix well and then add a can of coconut milk and simmer until the sauce is a little thicker. Lay fillets on top of mixture and cover for a minute or two, gently flip the fillets over and continue to cook until the fish flakes. Remove from heat immediately to prevent over cooking of fish. Gently stir all together and serve over a bed of rice."

593294,jimmer,2011-06-15 14:28:00,2730,It's a nice break from the usual fried fish that we all love so much.
