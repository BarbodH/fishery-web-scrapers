594264,captpierre,2011-06-19 02:02:00,2521,"I feel kinda dumb.  Just installed my new Lowrance HDS 7 (successfully I hope).  But I can't get the big ""LOWRANCE"" cover off.  Is there some kind or trick to it?  Nothing in the manual about it"
594267,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-19 02:07:00,1351,um.. is it clipped by the side?
594281,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-19 03:15:00,1107,just grab it on both sides and pull it off also don't leave it on unless the boats in the drive way it can damage the screen apparently they are on there pretty tight and take a bit of force to get off you wont break it .
594291,Terry,2011-06-19 10:01:00,14456,I grab it with my finger nails on the left side and and snap forward to get my cover off
594292,blue pickeral,2011-06-19 10:12:00,267, How can leaving the cover on damage the screen?
594294,Billy Bob,2011-06-19 10:43:00,5865,"Send it to me and I will give it a complete test for the year....""if"" OK I will send it back in the fall....  I'm sure you have it off by now BUT the real problem is keeping it on while towing....MANY others have lost their covers and now Lowrance recommends you do NOT tow with it on....but it's much better if you do to keep the nasty sun and rain off of it...so I made a strap the goes around it with Velcro strapping (about $3 or $4).  "
594441,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-20 02:15:00,1107, The inner guide that keeps it in place rubs on the screen so when your travelling either on the trailer or on the water the vibration can damage it .
594515,blue pickeral,2011-06-20 09:51:00,267, Thanks! Will check this out on my HDS 5.
