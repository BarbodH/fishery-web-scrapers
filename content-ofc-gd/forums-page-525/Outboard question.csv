594017,Afraz,2011-06-17 20:28:00,250,"Hey Guys,  Can anyone tell me how old this Suzuki outboard is ?  DT8 0801231048 - Serial number  Thanks"
594020,Bernie,2011-06-17 20:32:00,3190,"It's a 1943. Came out of a Japanese Zero.   JK Afraz. Find the model number. It's a lot easier to find the year with that. With Suzuki model numbers, the last letter indicates the year. For example, in DT40CRSN the 'N' tells you the model year is 1992."
594023,vance,2011-06-17 20:52:00,719,"Come on bernie zeros had a radial air cooled engine, way too big for an outboard  :rofl2:  vance"
594024,Big Cliff,2011-06-17 21:02:00,6899, Oh ya! But if it was in an outboard it would sure fly!!!!!  Oh wait a minute I guess an aircraft engine is an outboard of sorts! Would that be tiller or centre consel?
594025,Roy,2011-06-17 21:25:00,13728,It's an 8HP 1982. You can read the motor details here: http://store.brownspoint.com/dt8.asp
594028,Bernie,2011-06-17 21:51:00,3190,OK Roy. Thanks! I would have googled more but it's a pain on dial up. I bet Afraz has high speed.
594039,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-17 22:43:00,10439,Bernie It's time to come out of the dark ages man.   :rofl2: High speed is here to stay you may as well accept it and come in to the light!!!!
594049,Bernie,2011-06-17 23:41:00,3190,"I would Dave, but it's not available out on the island. At home it's great."
594146,Mike the Pike,2011-06-18 12:53:00,3421, TILLER of course!!!!
