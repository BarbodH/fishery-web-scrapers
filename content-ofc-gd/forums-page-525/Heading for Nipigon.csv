594361,pics,2011-06-19 16:54:00,1268,We are leaving for Jellico Wednesday...My buddy suggested a Mepps Syclops for the Brookies on nipigon..Any other suggestions?? We'll be staying for a couple of nights in a trappers cabin so we will have plenty of chances to hook into some big fish...I plan on taking a spinning outfit and possible a baitcasting set up as well..(I just need to find an affordable two piece rod for travelling purposes)..There will also be a few days of pike fishing and a few walleye lakes thrown in.....any suggestions would be appreciated..
594362,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-19 16:57:00,0,some jig flies might be a good idea if you can find some... something like mighty mitch and jungle joe's jig flies in terrace bay or wherever they are located.
