594404,strik,2011-06-20 00:02:00,175,Hey everyone  I have a 1993 johnson 100  when i satarted it  this moring  after running about 30 seconds  it  started to beep i turned it off  waited re started   again it happened.. I waited a couple min restarted it ran fine  the only thing different i did was  switch batterys   from all batterys to number 2 batters on my selector switch..  It ran great  got to where i wanted to fish   started the kicked fished. Then restarted the main  no issues  I know i should have counted the beeps but i never did ..   Anyone have this engin?  have a manual? know what the beeping was ? any info would be great.  Thanks for  your help Strik
594408,ecmilley,2011-06-20 00:15:00,2163,"what kind of beep, constant tone or morse like beep beep beep every couple seconds? constnat tone is overheat or fuel high rpm fuel restriction, beeping is low oil level or vro issues usually, if it went away could be a short in the harness"
594411,cheaptackle,2011-06-20 00:36:00,849,"Did you notice if it was ""peeing""? (as it's called)  That would lend more support to ec's suggestion about overheating.  You did say you ran it when you changed batteries so this should (hopefully) be a moot point and more of an indication of wiring problems.  Michael"
594434,strik,2011-06-20 01:48:00,175,"  it was  a couple of beeps but i never counted . The VRO has been disconected heard of to many issues.  The high rpm makes snice cause i when it started it reved up more then usuall  but that was just the first start..This is only my secon season with the engin but i have never had a issue  with it so far runs great and it even ran great once the beeping went away. I should have counted the beeps i know my older boat ( 2003 mer 30 4 st) had a manual and it told you what the beeps ment  It was ""peeing fine"" so i do not think that a issue  thanks  Strik"
