Got a good selection of colors, Pumpkin green, white, pumpkin/chartreuse,purple/silverflake,bleeding red/brown.Got some Yum crawdads. Got the trokar hooks and bell sinkers.Crankbaits are all stowed, and the boat is gased up and ready. We'll be on the water at 5am I have caught a few SMB OOS in the past couple of weeks,fishing walleye, so i know where they are. Lets hope they like what i have to offer in the morning.  On a side note.Should be interesting fishing with my wife pumped to the hilt with Pre IVF hormones that make her smiley happy one minute, and murderous the next. I WILL keep my PFD on at all times while on the boat tomorrow.It will be my best friend for sure  Wish me luck"
