594040,tomO,2011-06-17 22:59:00,363,"I,ve got 55lb thrust trolling motor and cant get very much power to the prop, it seems as far as the motor being able turn different directions thats fine but little power at the prop bout half speed I,d say when on high. Suppose this would be in the foot pad maybe? I,ve hooked two different batteries too it with no difference, Any ideas? thx."
594066,Whitespinnerbait,2011-06-18 00:42:00,2038,"  I would definitley go with foot pedal........They've been having issues with them for longest time  If its less than 3 years old, its still under warranty"
594070,tomO,2011-06-18 01:09:00,363,"thx . It,s 6 or 7 years old so I,ll start pricing them."
594087,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-18 02:17:00,10439, $96 at LeBarons.  Minnkota replacement pedal
594105,Sinker,2011-06-18 03:47:00,8692,"Are you sure both batteries are OK??  Sounds like your pedal is working fine, you just don't have enough power. I know the pedals suck, I've replaced mine a few times, but when it goes, its usually the steering in one direction or the other, or no power to the prop at all. Seems funny it would run, but only at half power, to me.  Load test your batteries.  S."
594106,Muskieman,2011-06-18 04:05:00,2472,..Try this....  unplug the pedal and take it apart (simple) get some Brake and Electrical contact cleaner.. spray it onto a cloth and wipe down all the contacts and smear a small amount of Dielectric grease on them  ..* REASSEMBLE the pedal before plugging it back in ( if not you might see smoke)...  that might do the trick ... It has for me and countless other Minn-Kota and Motor-Guide customers.  Randy 
594110,John Bacon,2011-06-18 04:17:00,3277,"Is it a 24 volt motor?  If so, did you connect the batter in parallel instead of in series?  Start with the easy stuff before you start taking your motor apart."

594274,tomO,2011-06-19 02:38:00,363,"ok Thx guys the one battery is brand new. I,ll try and taking it apart and cleaning it 1st. It,s a 12 volt motor ."
