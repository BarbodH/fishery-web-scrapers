Also if you don’t want to say on the board you can also pm me. For those who do fish cold water I may pm you not for spots but for questions such as better in fall or spring just because I no what the net can do to a river. Thank you in advance.

But if you miss the one or two weeks the trout are running then it is very scarce fishing.  It's a very clear creek, once the sun is up look for the trout to be tight in cover.  Drift a worm into blowdowns and logjams or doodle a small crankbait infront of wood.  The fish from that creek are very tasty, but remember it's one of the few naturally reproducing creeks in the province.  Keep the males, let the hens go."
