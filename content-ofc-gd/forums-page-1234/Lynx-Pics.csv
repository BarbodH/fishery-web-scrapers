56312,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 01:03:00,1780,"As usual I don't have the story but it's still nice to look at.  ""These pictures  were taken west of Cynthia Alberta Tuesday afternoon at 3PM.   Cats paid no attention to our truck. "" According to my reliable sources.  ▐αΣΓ╘▌╓ = translation- I need another moosehead, this snow is depressing.         "
56316,OhioFisherman,2007-04-07 01:08:00,6623,"Cool, is it normal to see that many together? Mom and kids?"
56324,Jigger,2007-04-07 01:12:00,1237,"Wow, I didn't know they hung out like that either... Thanks for sharing!"
56325,Bernie,2007-04-07 01:15:00,3190,"Wow Greenbay, That would be something to see. Hope sometime in my life to  see a wild lynx. Seen just about all wildlife around here but the cats- Lynx, bobcat or a cougar."
56328,irishfield,2007-04-07 01:21:00,26272,Last Lynx I saw was summer of '76. Sioux Lookout in the campground.  Thanks for posting John.
56329,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 01:22:00,1780," Hey Nip, who you callin Greenbay ? I'm just down the road from you here on Georgian, I think Brett Favre stinks that's about all I know about Green Bay.    lol/jk."
56330,Cookslav,2007-04-07 01:22:00,1457,"I'm no expert but My guess is Those are not Adult cats....still young enough to hang out with Mom. But I don't imagine they would for much longer, once that snows gone I'm guessing they are on their own."
56331,Greencoachdog,2007-04-07 01:22:00,8163,"Very cool pics!!!  We call'em ""Souped-up-Wildcats down here...  KNOCK'EM OUT JOHHHN!!!!!!!!"
56344,Bob,2007-04-07 01:56:00,370,I've seen a few in this neck o' the woods.  Unfortunately I never had a camera handy when I did.  Most times I've seen them were in low light conditions anyhow.  Only once spotted one playing in mid-afternoon.  My father and I were hunting grouse along the Boland River north of town and on the way back out we spotted this guy bouncing in and out of the ditch.  Must have been hunting mice and didn't pay us any attention at all.  We shut off the truck and sat and watched for about 20 minutes.
56347,taper,2007-04-07 02:00:00,611,Thanks for the photos. We never see any thing like that here in South Western Ontario.

60077,wacky tambaqui,2007-04-15 03:14:00,33,"In all my years of working and camping/fishing in the Northern Ontario woods I've met face-to-face with every 4-legged  native species you can name except the cougar.  Of them all the lynx is hands -um paws down- the most beautiful animal of them all.  Thanks for sharing, 'Giant."

60220,Moosebunk,2007-04-15 15:34:00,3970,"Real cool pics of an elusive and usually shy cat.  Once saw one in the wild atop a bluff overlooking a logging road I was driving up in Zec Dumoine.  A rarity, but definetly not an encounter forgotten.  Cool cats."
