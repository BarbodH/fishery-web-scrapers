60142,Dondorfish,2007-04-15 12:39:00,1000,Good luck on your outing today Cliff. Did you get any snow up your way? Here in Niagara all we got was rain - and not much of that so far!   Will be watching for your post   Don
60145,ccmtcanada,2007-04-15 12:41:00,7971," Thanks Tracker....no snow just east of Toronto...it stayed above freezing over night.  Temps going up to 5, but a nasty wind.  If we catch anything, you'll see a report!  Thanks."

60154,tjsa,2007-04-15 13:08:00,1578," Yup, send it our way, please, Moosebunk doesn't need it as much as we do. Okay, maybe he does, but I am being selfish."
60158,lew,2007-04-15 13:15:00,12767," Tom, I've been following your posts  about how dry things are up your way and the increased risk of alot more forest fires than usual. It's too late to expect much snow now, but hopefully you'll get enough rain to minimize the fires.  We didn't get much snow down here this winter either, but we've had soooooo much rain lately, that walking across the lawns is like walking on a wet mattress."
60161,Steelcat,2007-04-15 13:34:00,191,It seems that the weather pattern has shifted.  Remember we were having fall like weather in December and early January?  I guess the good old winter is going to stay until it serve enough of its time here with us.
60162,tjsa,2007-04-15 13:39:00,1578,"Lew, last weekend my bud had to use 4x4 to get into the lake we went to. Same area this weekend, and we drove in in 2 wheel drive, all the snow from last weekend was gone, evaporated, not melted. There are only patches of snow in the the bush in the sun sheltered areas. Our rivers are just starting to flow again after the recent cold snap, but all the ice is now on the bottom of the rivers, it sank down 3 weeks ago, because there is not enough water flow to raise it up and break it up. Reports are coming in of fish kills because of low water, Geraldton area is getting the most notice. My bud has a minnow pond behind his place, he was back there in August, and it was full, he went back there last week, and it was down 4 ft. Probably frozen to the bottom. We will have zero runoff this year, except for few rivers that are large lake fed, the others will be extremely low runoff. The steelhead run will take place really fast. When they are ready, they will run up, spawn, and retreat to the big lake within 3 days. It happened about 15 yrs. ago in a few rivers up here, during the week, and everyone missed it except for a few guys who weren't working days."
60208,Heybud_e,2007-04-15 15:26:00,208,"a little wet today, nothing major.. so i am gonna go get the rain suit i never got around to getting the other day and im goin fishin, little rain isnt gonna stop me!! Bud"
60238,carp-starter,2007-04-15 16:04:00,253,"It may be cold for today's date but most of what will come will be just a lot of rain. I know, trout season opens in less than 2 weeks.  Here are some PICS from Newfoundland right now. These guys will be skiing until July if they are lucky.  carp-starter         "
60240,Dondorfish,2007-04-15 16:07:00,1000,Awh man - thanks carp-starter - now I feel alot better about our weather!  Don
60242,Heybud_e,2007-04-15 16:09:00,208,"ya, now i dont feel to weird about standing around in a rain suit fishing... thanks!! CTC, get some bait, go fish!"
60243,tjsa,2007-04-15 16:19:00,1578,"Oh, that is what we need carp-starter, not that we would like to deal with it, we just need it. That, and more, rain, rain, rain. Hope it happens for us, sucks to deal with it, but we need it."
60294,OhioFisherman,2007-04-15 18:29:00,6623,"Sorry guys, I hope you get spring by August!"
