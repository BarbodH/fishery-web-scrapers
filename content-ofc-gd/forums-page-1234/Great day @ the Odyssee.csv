I got a bag full ( OK make that 2) of goodies and got to shake hands with so many people I couldn't even think of counting them.  The seminar were top notch from Big Jim's to Dr Cassleman's and Gord Pysers. There was a lot of great looking lures and all kinds of good deals on anything muskies.  Ok ya most of my loot came from the enormous prize table where I won 4 times the first draw and once on the second and third draw.  Thanks to everyone that came to support this great initiative. Let's hope for a bigger and better Odyssey in the very near future."

60287,Handlebarz,2007-04-15 18:14:00,3790,Sorry I could not stay Chris I thought about it but had to get going I did not want to wait and see what the weather man would have for the morning drive. I did find some good deals there Knipex cuters for $40 MCI shirts for $10 Hooks that sell for $15-$20 here were $11.99 at JB's Pro Tackle had alot of stuff and saved me alot on my cradle if ya knew the prices before hand you could find some good prices.  here are some pics I took most before the show opened and was a little busy to remember to take many more.   Jason from the MNR he has had alot to do with the Lake Simco project and is one hell of a good guy.   Our chapter space at the main booth for MCI we had a great time and talked with many people there that have either fished LSC or have wanted to come join us in the near future. thanks to all who stoped by.   Charles Weise and Joe what a couple of great guys and funny to go with it. Chuck had alot of great musky pictures with him and Joe had a bunch of lures to sell Charles is also a member of the Belle River Chapter.   Depth Master Lures has some great looking baits Jim and Jim had a nice setup baside the TO chapter booth which for some reason I did not get a pic of maybe it was due to the fact that Ron was in the way all the time I was over there.   Stacy of Pro Tackle had alot of stuff to offer and I know I saw alot of people walking out with the big nets and alot of his lures.    Waterwolf Lures what can I say about these two girls Mary and her mother were just AWSOME people I spent 1/2 hour or more later in the show talking withthem both and they were great they also had a pig plug from Gords speach on plastics and were swamped after the speach was done.   JB's had a big setup there and due to the lighting in that end all pics taken were bad.   Pete was nice enough to lend us his trophy musky for the show it was caught on Bobacanuche (I think thats how ya spell it) thanks Pete    I dont know why sonme pics were so bad but there was also a new company there HOT LURES and these things look great they are the next bulldog only better in my opinion there pic was to distorted to use along with others but check out there web site Aaron and Dean were two great guys to get to know and I bet alot of musky nuts will be pitching these things this year. check them out at.HOTLURES.CA   Well it is sad that there is way to many days to count down to the next one but I bet Chris is already getting things started had a blast and will not miss another gotta go the race is starting.
