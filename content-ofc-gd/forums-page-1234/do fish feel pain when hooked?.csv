59726,John Bacon,2007-04-13 23:55:00,3277,"According to studies that I have read; fish do not have the part of the brain that is used to sense pain.  According to those studies, fish do not feel pain.  Having said that, fish brains are different than human brains; it is possible that they use a different part there brains than humans use to sense pain.  I believe that the fight that they put up when hooked proves that if they do feel pain at all; it is not nearly to the same degree as humans.  How much of a fight would you put up if someine was trying to pull you in by a hook in your mouth.  As for the P3TA study with fish rubbing their lips against the side of the aquarium after being injected with bee venom, that only proves that they are aware that there is soming in their lips.  It doesn't prove that it causes pain."

59779,majorlifts,2007-04-14 01:44:00,171,"Ok tonyb, I guess all that work those scientists did, all the research, it was all for nothin. I guess they should have just called you. This is a dead subject dude, Scientist have proved without a doubt fish do not have pain receptors in the mouth area. However there is some pain receptors in the body. In fisherman posted there findings with trusted scientific research."
59781,urbanangler1990,2007-04-14 01:47:00,933,dead subject? u just stirred it
59846,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-14 11:19:00,621,here's some info  http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Courses/bio105/nervous.htm  http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/cont...mgq6wf8wknuc20/
59872,Bob,2007-04-14 13:37:00,370,"Nearly all scientific studies are funded by people looking for specific results so said scientists will do their best to prove the desired results, otherwise they lose their funding.  Because of this, most studies are biased and always will be.  I like fish and am not about to stop fishing for them."
59880,bigfish1965,2007-04-14 14:07:00,3382,"Fish lack the hypothalamus which is where pain (as humans know it) is perceived. A fish's brain is far less complex than a mammal's. Fish understand invaders, parasites, danger etc. and rely on fight or flight responses. If a fish felt pain like a person does, they would not run away from the pressure of a fish hook which increases  the pressure on the hook point. If they felt pain as humans do, they would move towards the pressure to reduce pain like a human or mammal would. P3TA is very big on anthropomorphizing animals and wants people to think we are the same. We are not. P3TA bases their stance on a study that invovled injecting fish with bee venom. The fish were shown to rub the injected area on the tank bottom continually until the venom subsided. This they surmised meant pain. In fact, this could have meant the fish had recognized a parasite since fish would never receive a bee sting in real life, it would not be within its instincts to know what to do. Fish who have hooks in the mouth continue on their lives normally provided the hook doesn't interfere with eating."
59894,Dutch,2007-04-14 15:00:00,831,"They probably feel more pain when you start to filet them....  Very informative post there, Rick, thanks!"
59905,urbanangler1990,2007-04-14 15:30:00,933,"great info Rick, very helpful, thnx!"

59989,fishindevil,2007-04-14 23:01:00,6254,OK can we kill this thread now as im felling pain.....cheers
58748,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 21:32:00,933,"i always get into a debate with my dad about this, do fish feel pain when hooked? i heard bass dont becuase they can eat hard shelled crayfish, what do yall think?"
58755,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 21:46:00,7971,Here's an article...it shows both sides of the argument....  http://www.nationalreview.com/swan/swan060503.asp
58758,Gerritt,2007-04-11 21:49:00,6129,"well their have been studies into this and Fish do not feel pain like you and I do, there or no to very few pain receptors in a fishes mouth. however when I say mouth I am talking about fish like Pike, Muskie, bass, pickeral.. where this is very little flesh within the mouth... They anti will have you believe they do feel pain, but have very little data to back it up... they try to use twisted reason.....  Now having said that, the above fish I mentioned I did for a reason, because they have very little muscle to none in the locations they are likely to get stuck with a hook. I do believe the case maybe different with soft mouthed fish however ( Carp, Suckers, white fish etc...) they tend to have alot more flesh in the mouth area... and I dont think biologists tested every fish possible to see weather fish feel pain in an area where they are likely to be hooked.   That being said it does not mean a fish cannot feel pain... however it would probably be completely different then what we as humans would experience. I say that because they do have a central nervous system...  take a torch to a fish and I think it would experience pain and its body movements would prove it...  Hope this helps!  Gerritt."

58760,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-11 21:52:00,4399,"This subject usually causes a lot of debate amongst anglers and the P3TA people. I have read articles done by people that are a lot smarter than me that claim  a fish does not feel pain because their brains are not developed enough, I read another article that claimed in another study some scientists injected bee venom into the lips of Rainbow Trout and the fish responded by rubbing it`s lips against the rocks indicating that it was indeed feeling discomfort.  Here`s a question for you if it was proven a 100% that fish feel pain would you give up fishing?"
58762,Pigeontroller,2007-04-11 21:57:00,2793,"Yes, thats no reason not to fish though!"
58763,MJL,2007-04-11 21:58:00,2427,Here's one article from Ontario out of Doors  http://www.fishontario.com/fishing/special...4992&page=1
58764,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 21:58:00,933,"thnx for link ccmt, and mjl  lookinforwallye, of course i wouldnt give up fishing, come on what kind of question is that? lol haha"
58765,jjcanoe,2007-04-11 21:58:00,744,If they felt pain they would tell us.  Fish that prey on spiny rayed fish such as stickle backs or perch obviously don't feel it when they chomp down otherwise they would search out easier prey.  You don't see many animals that eat porcupines!  jjcanoe
58778,irishfield,2007-04-11 22:14:00,26272,NO they don't...and leave it that way....
58797,Guidofisherman,2007-04-11 22:38:00,206,I know I do! 
58800,Puckhead,2007-04-11 22:49:00,377,Is there something wrong with me that I started laughing when I first read the title of this thread?
58801,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 22:51:00,933, yup...
58804,Roy,2007-04-11 22:54:00,13728,Maybe it's just a very tiny bit of pain. Like a bit of a headache. Maybe we can adjust.....used to be C&R...then CPR   now we can do CPAR....throw in an asperin.
59382,mrdylan,2007-04-13 00:53:00,111,"Can't be much worse than getting a tattoo and I like getting them  I love to fish but I don't hunt reason being no catch and release... Can't remember the last guys I met up with that caught and released a Buck.  If one was to hunt me I would be happy to get just a hook in the mouth if I knew I was going to live, If not then just make it quick."
59455,JerseyDog,2007-04-13 03:39:00,190,"I always find it a little strange that people will tend toward an opinion based on what may be in their best interests regardless of the facts. As an example P3TA would like to prove fish feel pain and anglers would like to deny it - both in order to support their own personal agendas.  The way I figure it, they probably do feel pain of some sort, some more than other and some in different ways than others - but either way I accept that as an unfortunate part of the blood sport that is fishing. And while I am not prepared to stop angling I have taken steps to minimize the stress on any fish I catch - with barbless hooks, careful C&R techniques and when a keeper, as speedy dispatch with my knife."
59463,luv2drift,2007-04-13 03:59:00,147,"if fish don't feel pain there would be absolutely no reason for them to run and create a fight!  God created all creatures with a mind and a spirit and humans with a mind, spirit and a soul.....they absolutely feel they are being caught!  I fish only to expierence God's creation! .... there's a bit of a bible thumper's lesson for you all. lol.///"
59464,majorlifts,2007-04-13 04:09:00,171,"The In-fisherman did a great article on the subject. Even had scientific evidence that proved fish do not feel pain around the inner and outer areas of the mouth.  Musky bites walleye, if musky felt pain, how the hell would he get those damn prickly fins past his gullet? Hahahaaa Damn fish got me 4 stitches and I dont think he felt a darn thing."
59466,majorlifts,2007-04-13 04:20:00,171,"WHERE the fish feels pain, is the important question for fisherman. Its no question a fish would feel pain if I stuck a hook up his ars, but they are predators, plain and simple. They are designed for their environment. A cheetah has to be fast to catch its meal, a fox has to be cunning, and a fish has to have less pain receptors in its mouth and track to devour live and kicken creatures, like crab fish with scales and teeth.  Imagine trying to down a bone fish whole, without feeling pain, Ha, not gonna happen."
59529,BITEME,2007-04-13 13:38:00,1969,Just to be clear on this in my opinion Do I care....... No not really There is a reason we are at the top of the food chain does it make a difference if its food or sport.....No will I stop doing this any time soon.......No do animals have a soul......if we do so do they dont care what any book says Do i enjoy HUNTING AND FISHING.......HELLYEAH!!!!!!! and I wish P3TA would fall off the face of the planet   Just for the record MEAT IS TO BE EATEN WITH VEGETABLES  my 2 cents
59554,Cast-Away,2007-04-13 14:58:00,790,"Send P3TA an email and ask them, then post it back here for a laugh!"
59556,urbanangler1990,2007-04-13 15:00:00,933," hahaha, that would be interesting"
59602,tonyb,2007-04-13 18:37:00,1637,"Of course they feel pain!  I don't think that they associate lures with pain, nor do I think they dwell on it or keep it in memory.  We have all probably at one point or another caught a fish with a hook in it's mouth from a previous breakoff from another angler, or net marks, etc.  If the fish were intelligent beings as P3TA states they are, don't you think they would avoid lures and being caught multiple times?  Fish that eat spiny rayed fishes will always juggle the fish around in their mouth until it goes down head first, with the spines not sticking into their throat.  Kind of like when you take a bite of a Jalapeno popper and the temperature is too hot, you bounce it around in your mouth until it cools  It is not an argument you can win, re: pain vs. no pain.
