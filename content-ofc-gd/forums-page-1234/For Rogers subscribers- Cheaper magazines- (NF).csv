After reading GOLFISHERS post on magazines, I thought some of you may be able to come out ahead. Anyone that does business with Rogers can take advantage of their magazine offer. There are a few mags that you can choose from.  Ontario Out OF Doors subsription is $10 / year through Rogers. Its $22/ yr from Ont OOD's. The savings is good enough for an extra x-rap, and a coffee. You just get tagged the cost on your next Rogers bill.  http://www.shoprogers.com/store/cable/medi...KNPH6FHG2K1E712   Oh yeah, and for all you Muskey fiserhmans, you can also make your subsription to ""Chatelaines"" here too   RB"
