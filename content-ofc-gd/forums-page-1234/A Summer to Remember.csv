59709,bucktail,2007-04-13 23:24:00,1857,Awesome people.
60314,Corey,2007-04-15 20:29:00,355,"You know they say there is strength in numbers... along with the generousity of everyone involved already, why don't we each pickup a lure or two and send it off to Chris and Speedtroll to go along with the rest of the gear he is getting. I know a have a number of brand new lures yet to be tested and would gladly box up a few to bolster Chris's tackle box.  If someone can PM me a place to send them too, I will ship em off this week.  cd."
60320,Jen,2007-04-15 20:55:00,833,"Great idea Corey,  Please PM me an address as well!  Cheers,  Jen"
42660,Loonietoon,2007-03-03 19:20:00,1450,"I am at a loss for words.... BUT... I will only say that I can second Gerritts words but only not as good.... This is the best family you could ask for next to your own.. At which point I can and will include as my OWN.. even when things were rough with my wife in the hospital last August.. this family was there in support... IT IS GREAT TO BELONG TO THE OFC FAMILY... Rick you are truly a great person and happy to call you a friend for what you are doing for Chris... To all the others Speil, T.J., Aaron, Barry, Sam, Dave & Shaun You all make me proud to know you for what you are all doing... Not forgetting  the things others do .. Like Maureen for Tyler... And to all the others that Help .... THANK YOU  This is all I can say for now..  If help is needed just let me know"

42666,tjsa,2007-03-03 19:35:00,1578,"WOW, this is great, but like Maureen said, it really does not suprise me one iota. So many times this board, and its members have come through for people, not just OFC'rs. Remember the Comeau family?"
42762,steve_paul,2007-03-03 23:24:00,658,"wow, I truly hope young Chris has an amazing time with these people.  Thanks to all for putting this together, an amazing effort"

42951,JEREMY,2007-03-04 14:41:00,300,Stuff like this is what makes OFC the best place on the net to be.God bless everyone involved.
42953,DT10Sam,2007-03-04 14:48:00,480,"I feel that our heart needs to explode with kindness at various times in life and Speedtroll needs all of our support for his young lad Chris.  Our family will always pray for the miracle that we are all seeking and having Chris in our hearts.   Kind regards,  Sam, Laurie, Andrew and Hunter"
42984,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-04 17:24:00,0,Wow what a great thing to be doing for Chris.  And Rob if you read this my offer to take you and Chris out for muskies is still open.  I believe.

Please keep us informed on whre and when and if possible maybe we cah have a M&G there for Chris. but then again there will be so much for him that day we can have it another just to have a excuse to get out again.

44238,wuchikubo,2007-03-07 14:42:00,1114,"For all those involved initiating this and those helping out, give yourselves a good pat on the back!  It was definitely hard not to have a teary eye after reading this.  I'm sure if anything else needs to be helped out, I would definitely suggest it be put up on the board as many members (including myself, regardless how limited it may be) would be willing to help.  OFC family is truly #1   :clapping:"
45592,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-11 03:41:00,2585,wow how cool is that!!!!!
46637,Dano,2007-03-13 23:19:00,719,Thats good stuff. Kudos to all involved.

47455,misfish,2007-03-15 16:25:00,29133,Dont know why I didnt read this thread along time ago when it started.Maybe the title didnt catch my eye.  Theres not much more that one can say that hasent already. Once again we show we take care of our own.  Kudos to all that are involved.
47881,Puckhead,2007-03-16 16:29:00,377,Great job guys... Wow - Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said...  Hope this gives them some great memories!  Cheers!
47956,Whopper,2007-03-16 18:57:00,2174,Well done to everyone involved.  Things like this is what made me come out of lurker status and become an involved member.  Whopper
48322,Handlebarz,2007-03-17 15:17:00,3790,  thats the same thing I had thought Brian
48336,Cookslav,2007-03-17 16:00:00,1457,"Me too....  Very touching, and I'm incredibly proud to be a member of this board right now."
54652,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-03 02:07:00,181,"All the best to chris! Get well, you can beat it!"
42632,Davis Battah,2007-03-03 17:45:00,31,"I'm at a loss for many words right now...  Cudos to all those involved in providing the opportunity for some really happy moments and memories during these tough times for Chris, his dad and their family.  Speedtroll, if you happen to get to read this don't forget to continue to Believe.  In the meantime, we'll all keep Believing too.  For anyone that hasn't been down to Toronto Sick Kids Hospital, their motto is ""Believe"" and it is very prominently displayed in the main lobby/ food court area to try to give some hope and inspiration to the parents of, and the children that are patients at the hospital during some of the most difficult and impossible of times."
