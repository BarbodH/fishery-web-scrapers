59822,kennyman,2007-04-14 04:30:00,737,"Gotta watch!!! Even though the Leafs are out, there is still some good hockey. You actually forget how good it is until you start watching it .......... playoffs are sure different. Wish they were there"
59869,Beans,2007-04-14 13:30:00,3339,Nope...now that the leafs are out of it and the Blue Jays are back I'll wait until they get it all sorted out for the finals for the Stanley Cup...  Go Leafs Go (next year)  make that Go Jays GO
