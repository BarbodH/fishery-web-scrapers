60317,Terry,2007-04-15 20:47:00,14456,"I had to go down to lebarons to return a transducer and pick up the right one for my x67c on Saturday day morning I must say it was a good experience, seems customer service is back a Lebarons..wonder when that happened   got back and thought what the heck, so I took the folding boat down to the river for a little crappie fishing.... many boats were by the trees so I went under the bridge...not many crappie were being caught but I saw a few real big ones brought in  but not by me  they were using minnows  I was using plastic..that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it  after about 20 mins I see the float go down and the fight is on...well not really what ever it was, it was small...yup  the prize was a 7"" perch....everyone one else was catching 13"" crappie and I get a stunted perch..story of my life   but hey I am out to relax so who cares....  I did get into some crappie...small crappies     but they were fun to catch  didn't I call this thread something about ""carp master""   so as time goes on  the float goes down and  takes off fast  I set the hook and say to myself "" self you have got a bass on there, so put the camera away cause you don't need that  crap""  well that sucker just kept running and I knew it wasn't a bass  it wasn't even that big but damn did it give me a fight  I just might have to look into this  carp  fishing the guys have been talking about  I wonder if there is the Carp Masters Classic on ESPN     so where is it I by that corn stuff  anyway...good way to spend a few hours on a Saturday"
