60082,Joey,2007-04-15 03:33:00,9122,"What, you couldn't figure out who was going to qualify 2nd and 4th.  What a bum  Joey"
51733,danc,2007-03-25 23:05:00,4677,Really?? I didn't know that.
51740,Daplumma,2007-03-25 23:12:00,1961,"Ya got to read the rules...Just kidding,I got burned that way 2 years ago.Thats why it has a */9 next to the name.Hope evryone sees this cause it will bite you in the butt later in the year. Joe"
51778,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-26 00:27:00,0,"Yes only 9 times all year including the chase. last year I saved myself enough guys in the A group to have front runners in every race.  That's why I didn't have Bush today I've already used him 3 times.  You figure with 36 races you will use up 4 guys in group C.  That is why it can get very interesting in the end, your roster becomes somewhat limited."
51813,Joey,2007-03-26 01:45:00,9122,"Hmmm, very interesting.  Thanks for that little tidbit of info.  I'll have to choose more carefully from now on.  Thanks  Joey"
51818,danc,2007-03-26 01:51:00,4677,"Does this only apply to your final selection? Or your final two selections .... lets say tier 1. Lets say I picked Stewart and Gordon on Thursday in tier one. Then on Sunday I settled for Stewart. Does my Gordon pick count as one of my 9 selections, even though I picked Stewart for the race?"
51819,Daplumma,2007-03-26 01:56:00,1961,Just the ones that you choose for race day count against you.In your example only Tony count. Joe
51822,danc,2007-03-26 02:10:00,4677,"Thanks Joe. I should be good. The only picks that I've wasted have been on Stewart, and I'm comfortable with that."
51879,SlowPoke,2007-03-26 08:34:00,2984,Tough week!! Lots of less-than-steller results but daplumma takes the week with 292 points!

51885,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-26 10:58:00,0,"Unreal top 3 separated by 16 points, that's like 8 positions on the track. That's like a little more then a 1.5 per race average. The way this is going we're going to have our own chase, LOL right now top 7 only 100 points apart."
53212,Daplumma,2007-03-29 20:40:00,1961,Dont forget to get your picks in.Another COT race and another short track...Good luck.If you want to see the best racing in NASCAR the trucks roll Saturday at 3:00 on Fox.Go Johnny B!!! Joe
54234,Daplumma,2007-04-02 00:59:00,1961,"How did everyone do?Not too bad of a race today,was surprised to see 24 and 48 run that well.I didn't pick either of them. Joe"
54254,Joey,2007-04-02 01:45:00,9122,I'm up another spot     I'm trying to figure this only picking one person 9 times out tho. Going to have to start being careful.  Joey
54256,fishdawg,2007-04-02 01:47:00,912,ahh yes  Hendricks is cleaning up
54321,SlowPoke,2007-04-02 08:03:00,2984,"Thank-you, thank-you very much. I'd like to thank all the little people that helped get me here...  "
54414,Joey,2007-04-02 14:33:00,9122,"Ya, you kicked butt this time Slowpoke.  Joey"
54445,SlowPoke,2007-04-02 18:01:00,2984,"It made listening to the race at work quite enjoyable (WGR AM 550). At one point it was Jimmy Johnson and my 4 drivers in 2nd to 5th place... (Johnson, Gordon, Hamlin, Busch, Yeley)... now that would have been a week to remember!  -Brian"
55334,Joey,2007-04-04 19:40:00,9122,"Okay, I have a question.  Now that I know we can only pick a driver nine times, I want to know how many times I have picked some drivers.  I read the rules and it says at the bottom ""The number of races each player has started for you will be listed along with all of his other stats. ""  I can't seem to find this part, can someone clue me in as to where to look.  Thanks  Joey"
55340,SlowPoke,2007-04-04 19:50:00,2984,"Joey, when you pick your drivers you will see in the first column beside thier name how many times you have used them in a race... when you are viewing your team it will be the second column to the right of the 'active driver' check box.  Look for 0/9 or 1/9 etc. -Brian"
55345,Joey,2007-04-04 19:52:00,9122,Thanks Brian.  Joey
55399,danc,2007-04-04 22:02:00,4677, So does this mean that you can only pick Smoke 3 more times this year??   :clapping:
55415,Joey,2007-04-04 22:59:00,9122, 
55436,Daplumma,2007-04-05 00:13:00,1961,"Joey,save smoke for the latter part of the year,he will be there then.You have to be careful not to burn out your 3 tier guys too cause some dont make all of the races.The road courses are a time to make up some big points cause the talent in the 3 teir is some of the best,Fellows and Said (if he is in 3rd tier)come to mind.Dont go with your heart,thats how the JR fans lose in this game,go with the drivers strengths even if you have to pick Robby Gordon on a road course or that asshat Biffle.Good luck... Joe"
59286,Daplumma,2007-04-12 21:23:00,1961,Get your team set before the deadline.No stinkin COT and a cookie cutter track.The usual suspects on these tracks will do..coug cough hendricks cough cough gibbs cough cough.Good luck Joe

59914,SlowPoke,2007-04-14 15:47:00,2984,"I'm feeling a little ripped off for Q points because of the weather... I guess Yahoo isn't giving out the points. My guy's Q'd 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 18... hmmm decisions."
51722,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-25 22:46:00,0,"That last caution killed me if that race ended with 5 to go I would of had guys in 1-4-7-39th but ended up in 3-13-14-39th instead. That's like losing 36 pts in a flash. There is going to be a lot in the high 200's this week but I don't think anyone will break the 300 mark so it's still a tight race.  Gota love Bristol but Kyle said it best, the car of tomorrow sucks."
51730,Daplumma,2007-03-25 23:00:00,1961,"But I did have Kyle. Since he's in the second tier, Ill be picking him every week.   You got to pace yourself,you can only pick him 9 times and then you cant use him anymore. Joe"

It's going to be another tough one for team trophy muskie chasers. God I've got Boris said and Jarret LOL I guess at least Jarret is starting. And I'm sure I would of had Gordon for California.
