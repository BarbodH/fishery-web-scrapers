I have a location in mind where during the summer months lakers are plentiful but deep just wondering where they would be after ice out.  The area im talking is a drop-off rom 10-20 ft down to 60-100, sandy bottom and some rocky areas too.  Where will these fish be located ?  along the drop, in the shallows or down deep.  rainbows should be around too as this drop is near the shoreline.  im thinking boars, flatline or if the fish are deep downriggin, thoughts?   thanks kriawler"
