Started on one trib where they had some luck on Sunday but not even a sniff.... saw a couple of fish landed, mink and beautiful sunrise. Waters were gin clear! Not deterred we headed off to another trib and ol' reliable didn't disappoint. We managed to land three nice hens and this little fella! Until our next adventure, BG  "
