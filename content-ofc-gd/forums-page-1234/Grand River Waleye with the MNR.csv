58884,Smokey,2007-04-12 00:17:00,1278,"Good job Steve. There sure are some monsters there, i'll be down to find them on the big lake this summer. How's the fish ladder working? Is it working at all of are the fish having a hard time finding it at the old damn. Too bad they couldn't get one at the main river and bridge, you'd probably see more fish making it to the upper on there own.  Thanks for the pics."
58890,GbayGiant,2007-04-12 00:23:00,1780,"Thanks for sharing that, some nice fish there, looks like there ready to burst."
58891,Fishmaster,2007-04-12 00:23:00,920,The lader is working ...most of our big fish came from right infront of it today ...this year we will not be watching the lader just letting it do its part ...but there is lots of fish around it ..
58895,canadian_copper,2007-04-12 00:26:00,925,AWSOME WORK GUYS!!

58959,easton13th,2007-04-12 01:14:00,371,Great work out there! Amazing fish. Thanks for putting in the effort!
58987,FinS,2007-04-12 02:04:00,463,looks like fun great job and some beauty eyes pic #6 is a wall hanger
58994,pikehunter,2007-04-12 02:17:00,1659,Good job Steve. Nice looking eyes. How are they being netted? Have never seen the ministry do this before. If a chipped fish is caught how can you tell if it has been?
58999,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-12 02:33:00,181,Great thing you guys are doing?
59000,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-12 02:34:00,181,"Don't mind the question mark, typo!"
59014,Fishmaster,2007-04-12 03:02:00,920,We use a shocking boat fish get stunned rise to the top them we net them with landing nets .....put them in a tank and there back to life ...as for the Microchip its placed under there pecks very tinny device put in with a small needle ...these are placed in fish so that the MNR can wave a wond over Gill Netters fish toats and no forsure if there is tagged and microchiped fish in the toats ..if people still eat pecks on walleye you may find something crunchie ...
59045,Dano,2007-04-12 09:56:00,719,"Good stuff, thnks for sharing that. Kudos to you for helping out, its a lot of fun doing stuff like that."
59055,ccmtcanada,2007-04-12 11:42:00,7971,"Some great work you are doing there!  Glad to hear that the MNR and good people like yourselves are working to improve the fishery.  Bly and I want to catch more big Walleye this year, and this helps ensure a healthier population!  Dont worry...we release all Walleye we catch....LOL."
59115,Fishmaster,2007-04-12 14:43:00,920,Nothing wrong with eating the odd fish ..but i would like to see alote more people on the grand release some fish instead of taken limits every trip day after day ..i had a guy come in the store about a month ago saying i hope the MNR stocks more fish in the river ...i said why so you can fill your freezer for the winter ...he told me he took over 80 walleye in one season ..
59121,mattyk,2007-04-12 14:59:00,2110,those are some nice looking eyes!
59123,Fishmaster,2007-04-12 15:08:00,920,we had a few over 11lbs last year a couple in the 14lb range ...
59128,walleyejigger,2007-04-12 15:16:00,876,"WOW, those are beauts, keep up the good work"
59565,bigbuck,2007-04-13 15:26:00,2449,"Taking over 80 walleye in a season is fine as long as they aren't all from the same spot/area. At 4 fish/day, that's 20 days on the water taking his limit, so only 20 meals. If he's taken a couple of hundred walleye out of the same spot then he's looking to deplete the stocks pretty damned quick."
59566,specktacklure,2007-04-13 15:36:00,56,We need more people like yourselves helping out our fisheries.Kudos to you and keep up the good work.
59585,Fishmaster,2007-04-13 17:23:00,920,Well i don't think he would be whineing about not enough fish in his spot if it wasn't hurting that area ..80 in one locations is not very smart thinking ..he even carped he had to go buy walleye last summer ..  and if you have 2 people in your house one with a Conservation Lic and one with a Full lic that 6 fish aloud in the freezer ...and im sure he had much more then that in there at one point of time ..
59588,easton13th,2007-04-13 17:54:00,371,Eat lots! Eat fast! Regardless what you are doing is a great thing! For those that respect the efforts please keep it up..  Thanks .
59635,JEREMY,2007-04-13 19:46:00,300,80 fish in one season thats more than i have kept in my 17 years fishing.
