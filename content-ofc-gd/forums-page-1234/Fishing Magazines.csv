60024,fishindevil,2007-04-15 00:12:00,6254,"I subscribe to the following ontario out of doors in-fisherman walleye in-sider great lakes angler the canadian fly-fisher  they are all great magazines,and i read them all the time ,and i get a huge discount from my work,so its great cheers"
60063,JPD,2007-04-15 02:07:00,296,Hey fishindevil.. you my friend are a fishing mag junkie  JP
60076,terzaghi,2007-04-15 03:09:00,12,"In-Fisherman covers a wide variety of species and approaches.  Outdoor life will get you hunting and fishing.  Walleye insider concentrates on what the pros are doing.  Field and stream will also get you hunting and fishing.  Subscribing to these magazines will help allot when all you can think about is fish.  I subscribe to all of the above and have caught more fish because of it.  Reading new techniques and ways to catch species already in the body of water you are fishing will improve you time on the water.  In fisherman is my favorite.  Tight lines,  Ryan"
60216,Moosebunk,2007-04-15 15:31:00,3970,"Esox, Real Fishing, ODC, OOD and Canadian Fly Fisher.  A couple will likely not be renewed but all are good magazines.  Anything fishing, in fact makes good reading material."
59608,Golfisher,2007-04-13 18:57:00,586,"After seeing me read my only fishing book for upteenth times before drifting into sleep, my wife told me that perhaps I should subscribe to a few fishing magazines to keep up with the times and actually find some new stuff to read.  The book, after all, was published 15 years ago, and I've read it so many times that I can probably quote some passages verbatim.  And therein lies, said my wife, the reason why I'm such a lousy fisherman--I had been studying a newbie book religiously for the past 15 years.   I think she had a point.  So, I figured I should inquire the good fellas of this fine establishment to see which fishing magzines they subscribe to.  I'm a firm believer in the monkey-see-monkey-do approach, as the monkey does reasonably well by aping others.  Cheers,"
59612,ccmtcanada,2007-04-13 19:01:00,7971,"The only one I get is Ontario Out of Doors....came with my OFAH membership.  I'm more of a ""pick and choose"" kind of reader.  I'm interested in local species, locations and tips.  If I see one that fits that description, I'll buy it.  I dont really care about the fishing in Cuba, or other exotic locations.  If I ever plan a trip there, then I'll get one, but until then..."

59626,lew,2007-04-13 19:23:00,12767,"The only one I actually subscribe to is Esox Angler, but will grab a copy of In-Fisherman the odd time if there's something interesting in it."
59631,huntervasili,2007-04-13 19:33:00,1604,"Canadian Fly Fisher, North American Fishing (and Hunting) Club mags, OOD, DUC mag... THink thats it"
59633,Hookset,2007-04-13 19:38:00,367,I subscribe to In-Fisherman magazine. I know it's American based but the fish don't know if they're American or Canadian. I think they represent the cutting edge. I've gotta get my act together though and subscribe to the OFAH and get Ontario Out of Doors. The work that the OFAH does in representing Fisherman and Hunters politically is worth supporting them alone.  Hookset.
59643,irishfield,2007-04-13 20:25:00,26272,Esox Angler and I got a free subscription to In- Fisherman when I bought my Stowmaster Net at JB's last Fall.
59644,Daplumma,2007-04-13 20:29:00,1961,"In fisherman here,a good general fishing magazine with lots of tips.A good book to read  would be Muskies on the Shield by Dick Peterson if you are inclined to go after the elusive Shoal Carp. Joe"
59653,ketchenany,2007-04-13 20:44:00,3229,"Used to get them ALL for FREE at an Advertising Agency I was with for many years, see if you placed ads in them they send stacks of them. Now at this agency we don't place ads so the pickings are slim and none  <_<   but at home it's Real Fishing  A"
59657,Victor,2007-04-13 20:58:00,1609,i guess it depends on what you usually target ... i used to get both OutdoorCanada and OOD  ... personally i prefer OOD more because its focus is in Ontario  it just sucks to read about all the amazing fishing somewhere else in Canada where you most likely wouldn't be able to get to lol
59660,huntervasili,2007-04-13 21:01:00,1604,I agree Victor... I used to get OC but i too liked OOD more
59661,douG,2007-04-13 21:01:00,2693,"Outdoor Canada and Ontario Out of Doors are my favourites, InFisherman is not too bad.  EA has great content, but the writing and editing could be improved imo."
59673,outdoorguy61,2007-04-13 21:33:00,220,"I like OOD, BC Outdoors, In Fisherman (too few true trout articles), Canadian Flyfisher.  outdoorguy61"

59701,Dano,2007-04-13 22:59:00,719,"Ontario Out of Doors is good, as is Outdoor Canada. In Fisherman is indeed a good one too, strictly fishing, multi species, so if you arent a hunter, you dont sacrifice content. I also get Esox Angler, but to be honest havent gleaned much from it yet, perhaps because I am the supreme angler and already know everything ........JK  I am a pike guy, and have never fished for musky (yet) or read about them, so I guess thats not a fair perspective.."
59707,GbayGiant,2007-04-13 23:11:00,1780,"My parents sell all the mags at their store, so I get to read them all for free.  If there are any worth keeping I'll buy them.  The mags are out for like a week and then all the articles are on the websites for free anyway."
59708,bucktail,2007-04-13 23:21:00,1857,Been a In-fisherman subscriber for 25 years now. Still have every one! Also OOD with my OFAH membership. Pick up Esox and Muskeyhunter as well as Walleye insdier from the stands.

59728,Guest lundboy,2007-04-13 23:58:00,0,"I've been subscribed to Bass Masters and Bass and Walleye Boats (BWB) for years.  Previously subbed to In-Fisherman, but lost interest in it about 3 years after Al Lindner left.  Once in a while I will pick one up off the shelf though same with OOD and Outdoor Canada.  Maybe with my Extreme Angler Winnings, I might have a new magazine to subscribe to!  I have never seen one before."
59745,fishdawg,2007-04-14 00:38:00,912,"through OFAH memeber ship I get OOD also to support my little cousins school fundraiser, ive given North American Fishing Club a shot... wont be renewing - I will be soon subscribing to Great Lakes Angler Magazine instead  i'll buy other interesting issues of Esox ANgeler, Outdoor Canada, ect... too time to time  I recently was given a coupla dozen 88-93 issues of Ontario Fisherman & OOD  - pretty neat to read them old gems"
59749,Rich Clemens,2007-04-14 00:51:00,3131,Musky Hunter Esox Angler In-Fisherman  That keeps me in reading material.
59750,Greencoachdog,2007-04-14 00:52:00,8163,"The In-Fisherman here, it's a multi species mag and I'm a multi species angler."
