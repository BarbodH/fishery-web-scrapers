I know a lot of you have young children or are planning on being new parents.  If you are feeling like a shut in tomorow come out to the international centre for the baby show.  I will be there with the family business trying to educate the public on cloth diapering and baby wearing.  If you happen to ""fit the profile"" drop by the booth and mention that you are an OFC'er and I will make sure to get you some baby garb, maybe some sunglasses for the little tykes for those long days on the water. www.forbabywithlove.ca  booth 108.  I am the only dude selling cloth diapers, hahahaha.  Exception of course is my wifes, partners husband."

I then invented ""refastenable"" diapers come the second kid...but of course was toooo stupid to patent such a simple idea. I used packing tape across the diaper so the tape tabs would't rip it when checking the diaper....long before refastenables ever hit the shelves. Not the only patent I missed in the last 25 years."
60054,pigeonfisher,2007-04-15 01:58:00,696,"these aren't your moms cloth diapers, Wayne.  They have come a long way in the last 4-5 years since the ""green economy"" has come on strong.  2 tonnes of landfil per child using disposables...DANG  Prolly more if they are on my diet."
60057,irishfield,2007-04-15 02:00:00,26272,Good luck with sales. Maybe you can work on a one lure per sale commission or similar!
