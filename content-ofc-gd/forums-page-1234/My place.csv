59868,Abberz,2007-04-14 13:22:00,140,Eddy what lake is this north of Kingston? I live in Kingston in Collins bay.
59908,finfan,2007-04-14 15:34:00,44,Wonderful property ed! I've been thinking of a place around there myself. Enjoy!
59921,Eddyk,2007-04-14 16:32:00,195,Abberz. The lake in the picture is Upper Beverly lake and it flows south through the town into Lower Beverly lake. These are part of the Rideau lake system.
59993,tjsa,2007-04-14 23:06:00,1578,"Excellent Ed, looks like you could even put in a few holes for a par 3 chip'n putt."
59994,lovetofish,2007-04-14 23:07:00,500,"I hope one day, that i can own a property like that!  Sweet!  lovetofish"

59549,Eddyk,2007-04-13 14:39:00,195,A couple of people have asked about where I moved to so heres a couple of pictures.   The first picture is my yard. As I posted the other day almost every morning there is a flock of wild turkeys wandering around out there and Ive seen the odd deer. The next is a bit of the lake behind me. I can carry my canoe over there and catch my breakfast.  The last is a bay on the same lake. This lake was dammed up about 200 years ago to run a locall mill. Its about 5 miles long and is supposed to be a gret bass lake. There are almost no cotages on it and it is great for canoing. I hope you enjoyed my little piece of heaven. Im about a half hour north east of Kingston.
