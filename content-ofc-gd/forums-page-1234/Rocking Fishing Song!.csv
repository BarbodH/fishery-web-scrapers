58461,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 13:58:00,213,"HI,  One other thing I had to mention here. I know TJ listened to the song this morning and he said helped wake him up. In fact, I think he got a little out of control and destroyed a section of his house listening.  So, I have a new buddy I've connected with I thought I should tell everyone about ... especially since there's been all this teasing on here in the past about Peter Frampton and all. Must be the long hair, I guess. Anyway, while I can't play or sing a lick, even at my more advanced age, I'm still a rocker-type at heart and like the music loud at times ... eh?  SO, a young guy who is truly a very talented rocker - from Detroit (Rock City) - is also a fishing guy and loves muskies and muskie fishing. Anyway, we hit it off ... a rocker-dude who fishes muskies has got to be a good guy.  Anyway, his name is Brian Schram ... he and his Schramband did a fishing song called ""Now We're Fishing"" ... you have to check it out. It just may be a little more ""energetic"" than some of you like, but give it a listen and let me know your thoughts. We've (Jennifer) put the song up on my personal website http://www.petemaina.com/ so you can just click there and give a listen. Check out the band's site too for latest video.   (Hey Thorpie ... you're gonna love it   )  Pete"
58466,TJQ,2007-04-11 14:02:00,7806,LOL...   we had a mosh pit.... kind the anti Brad Paisley fishing song....
58473,Terry,2007-04-11 14:11:00,14456,"Ted Nugent, move over......"
58491,Puckhead,2007-04-11 14:25:00,377,"If that tune won't wake you up on those days when the bed is too darn comfortable to get up and go fishing, nothing will..."
58503,blaque,2007-04-11 14:44:00,2419,"I just introduced the song to the whole office here at work against their will, (computer speakers have a little crackle to them lol) none of my fellow co-workers found it as humorous as I. LOL!! Deadbeats!!"
58531,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 15:11:00,213,"Ha ha ... that's hilarious stuff  So the office didn't think much of the song ... have the speakers turned up a little bit?  Yeah, I better warn Ted ...  Keep the mosh pits going ...  Pete"
58548,blaque,2007-04-11 15:41:00,2419,"Yeah she was cranked, I loved it, but some of the others are a little stuffy around here....... Being non fisher people and all."
58552,Roy,2007-04-11 15:53:00,13728,"Geeezzzz Pete! How about if we merge that tune to the video of Gillespie doing the muskie deck stomp? Good band, Bud...thanks for sharing the tune."
58569,Bly,2007-04-11 16:23:00,1556,"Makes me think of flying across the lake at top speed in a serious boat....and I have never done that  LOL  Thanks for the link and I agree with Puckhead ""If that tune won't wake you up on those days when the bed is too darn comfortable to get up and go fishing, nothing will...""   !!  bly"
58579,ecxstriper,2007-04-11 16:49:00,343,"Thank you Pete I need that. I find most music a little to clam for me . All I 'm going to say is ""Crank it up ""! Now I can do some head banging  while I'm fishing. What a combination.    I'm still waiting for a fishing song from Gridlock (hint,hint)"
58581,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 16:51:00,213,"Ha! She was cranked eh?   ... well give it a few more rounds and all the stuffiness will be knocked right out of 'em.  You know, that's a good idea Roy ... we gotta merge Gillespie and Schramband ... the muskie stomp.  It does kinda make you wanna drive fast in something. Oh yeah, and head bang too  Pete"
58587,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 16:58:00,7971,"Love the song!!!  Gotta love the speed and energy!!  Alex...there have been a few nights when bly and I are out fishing and the action is slow that I started lyrics for a tune....who knows...maybe I'll get it done one day....haha.  It'll have more of an ""anticipation"" feel, and not a complete rock out like this awesome tune!"
58676,aplumma,2007-04-11 19:07:00,6896,Looks like you are earning the long hair Pete. Good music that brings back memories. We used to jam on this just before the rubber band goes at the jetski races in region 8.  Art
58713,Crazyhook,2007-04-11 19:55:00,1154,awesome Tune!!  Ps Sorry for all the Frampton jokes  :)  well not really...
58737,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 21:15:00,213,"Glad you're liking the tune. Yeah, a little lift on a cold, blustery day - that gets you thinking fishing is a good thing. Of course, if it gets you to swat your head   - so much the better to keep you awake.  Yeah, I guess I may have earned my long hair and the Frampton jokes ... all in good fun Crazyhook.  "

58822,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 23:20:00,213,"  I hope folks are noticing that Brian got catch and release in there! Important stuff  ... and looking for his ""next bite"" at the end.  My favorite part is the Geetar solo though"
59092,duber,2007-04-12 13:52:00,220,Love it!  That song would make a great intro song for a fishing show.
59371,mrdylan,2007-04-13 00:29:00,111,Song of the year!!!
59385,mason05,2007-04-13 00:57:00,258,Nice tune.  Kinda has a little Kyuss feel to it.  Corn Nug
59882,Crazyhook,2007-04-14 14:09:00,1154,"Now how we forget about your sidekick Marc "" Rod Stewart "" Thorpe  ( best hair in the biz)"
59899,finfan,2007-04-14 15:08:00,44,PETE! I could listen to that stuff all day long...it really gets my blood flowing so CRANK IT UP EH!
60023,fishindevil,2007-04-15 00:08:00,6254,Hey pete it kinda suits you good with the hair and all.  ..lol..lol great speedy energetic fishing tune...2 thumbs up   cheers
