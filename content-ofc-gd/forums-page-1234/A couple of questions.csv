Police college and a baby on the way have made fishing almost non-existent.  I have a couple of questions for those of you who fish the Upper Credit River  1) Where is a good starting point up there? I have no Idea because I've only really fished the mouth and Erindale Park  2) Are leech patterns good for early season browns?  Thanks guys   Dave"
