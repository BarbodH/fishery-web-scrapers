59564,urbanangler1990,2007-04-13 15:23:00,933,"Walleye Patterns:  In spring, Rice lake walleye can be found scattered in the weedflats around Bewdley, cast a silver rattle spot, retrieve at medium speed in 5-8 ft. of water, try to cover a lot of water, this area is quite large. If the bite is off, try trolling in this area with a chartreuse worm harness. Also fish the mouth of the Otonobee River, where it spills into the lake, use jigs tipped with worms or minnows, in the deeper holding pools off Jubillee Point. Rice lake pickerel/walleye average 1-2 pounds, although some lunkers in the 5-6 lb range are not uncommon.  this looks helpful, i got it from http://www.thefishinguide.com/rice.shtml"
