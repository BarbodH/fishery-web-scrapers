Plenty of emerald shiners to get them started, then they can start to acquire a taste on the plentiful Perch. Once they get up to the 36"" size, they will start to roam with the newly emerging Herring population. There are plenty of suckers and ling as well. Once you see them following the schools of whitefish, look out!  For now, I will just enjoy fishing and not worry about catching a new world record Muskie. For that matter, even if I did catch a ""potential"", there would only be 2 people who would know, my fishing buddy and myself."

That's were I caught, by mistake of course, my one and only giant in 82'. It is hanging on my wall, did that back then. Had to tip the scales at 22 pounds!!! It is a Tiger Musky, does that count?  My big Musky story, you know I'd have one, was a sighting when I started fishing on a day trip to Port Severn from Hamilton. We had rented a 12' tinny and I saw this green thing swimming towards the side of the boat. I yelled to Mr. Stringer to look over the side, he saw the head while I could still see the tail. I could I.D. three fish then, a Great White, I saw the movie, a Sunny, was an expert at 8 years old, and a Northern, a hammer handle was my first game fish on my Popiel Pocket Fisherman.  I thought this monster was a Pike, my buddy confirmed it was indeed a Muskellunge, which I had never heard of before. Quite the argument on the way home from the other 2 guys. They didn't see it but guaranteed it was a Sturgeon. All I knew was I never wanted to catch one after seeing it, and my wish has come true so far if  Tiger doesn't count."

But maybe the 60lbers are 50-55lbers that just ate and that's as big as they get.  If this is true they max out about 62lbs.  Another thing is the max length of the muskie we are catching is 55 to 60"".  The max girth is about 30"".  For me I am happy with fish under 50lbs. They are all nice fish."

It's probably no coincidence that the disputed record (and many other large fish) have been caught by anglers targeting other species.  One has to think that conventional Muskie fishing tactics are not conducive to catching these super tankers because similar to monster pike, their habits are very different.  These larger, slower slobs may be feeding on smaller forage maybe?  That's it!  I'm selling all of my Muskie gear and targeting these beasts with bottom bouncers and minnows LOL!"

867746,OhioFisherman,2014-08-15 14:04:00,6623,"Forage? I recall seeing another guy at a camp in Pointe Au Baril with a 19-20 inch bass that a Muskie had thought was forage! The bass was ripped from it's gill plates back and the Muskie didn't let go until it saw the boat. Just guessing that once they reach a certain size they view everything else as forage?  The Georgian Bay has the area and habitat? Also the food supply? Everything from baitfish to Muskie sized baitfish like perch, walleye, bass, and trout? The bass in the California lakes seem to put on some pounds eating trout?  Picking the best area to fish for them around 30,000 islands complicates the problem? Not to mention that you had probably better know the area well to avoid busting a prop or lower unit? It's just not the greatest area to be in a hurry in?  We were never really prepared to land a huge fish, we saw some big ones and lost them, and then there were the fish that we never saw? Just peeled out line. I don't recall us ever catching a small one, but they had to be there, the back bays seemed like a perfect spawning area.  Your call, pick your favorite spot and fish like hell!"
