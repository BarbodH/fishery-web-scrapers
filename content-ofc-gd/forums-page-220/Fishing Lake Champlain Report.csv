I rarely got a chance to fish as I was busy putting on worms and removing the fish from the hooks. I was really impressed with this lake. We caught so many fish and very nice sized panfish from the dock. Every evening we would get into some nice sized bass which was pretty fun for the kids before we got chased of the lake by the mosquitos. The kids had a great time and so did I . I did catch my first ever chain pickerel, which was pretty cool.             I think this is a hybrid bluegill/pumpkinseed sunfish      White perch   Chain Pickerel "

867997,Roy,2014-08-17 11:50:00,13728,The US rates Champlain as one of the top 10 bass waters in the country. It's a great multi species lake. It looks like you all had a really good time there.  Thanks for the report and pics of young'ns smiling ear to ear.  That chain ain't too shabby either as the record is around 8lbs. They really are a beautiful fish.....smaller than a pike but stockier. Thanks again.
867999,Rich Clemens,2014-08-17 12:22:00,3131,Love the smiles on the kid's faces.  That's what it's all about.
