Gave it a solid hour and a half then moved in for some smallies and pan fish.  Another amazing sunrise.       Here ya go Steve.  All released. When the water gets a bit colder,I,ll be keeping me a feed.  A sample of the 50+ we got this morning. When I say this morning,I mean 6 AM til 11 AM. That,s a 5 hour work out.   Caught from 15-40 fow.            One more day. Looks like it will be another great forecast to be fishing."
