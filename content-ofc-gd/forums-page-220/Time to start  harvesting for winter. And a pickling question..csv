Turns out,SIM card was pouched.   Strike 2. So what to do on a windy droul day?  Head down to Coppas  (formally Highland Farms) and pick up some fresh Ontario harvested veggies to prepare for this winter. It,s always amazing the price and size of their cabbages,cauliflower  and broccoli.. We will do this until they bring in the out of country stock. By then,we well be well stocked up for the winter months.  Basketball and volleyball size veggies.  .99 cents each for the Broc,and $1.99 for the caul. Amazing. Blanched and in the freezer they went..     Needed freezer bags,so stopped into the dollar store. While there I came across a collection of fishing stuff. Ya it,s all cheap stuff. Well sorta. Opened a package of the spinner baits. Strong hook and sharp. No bad for $2. Grabbed a half dozen.    Now as for my pickling question.  I love pickled cauliflower and peppers. Whats a simple recipe for this? Im thinking a dozen 1 pint jars.  Would my vinegar and water mixture I use for beets be fine?"
867912,bushart,2014-08-16 18:25:00,2628,OK Nobody moves till we find out what happened to MisFish...Send out an APB!!  I'll stay back here and guard the women and liquor
867913,misfish,2014-08-16 18:30:00,29133, All yours Terrance.
867922,Gerritt,2014-08-16 19:38:00,6129,Nice haul of veg there!  I just did a bunch of pickled cayenne peppers I use this for the brine..  6 cups water 2 cups white vinegar (5% acid) 2 tablespoons kosher or canning salt Throw in some peppercorns Bring to a boil. Add a few cloves of garlic to each sterile jar.  You may notice I did not add pickling spices.... I want my hot peppers to taste like hot peppers... Not pickles  G
867923,misfish,2014-08-16 19:47:00,29133,"Thanks G  That,s pretty simple.  Do you allow to cool before pouring in the solution?"
867924,Gerritt,2014-08-16 19:57:00,6129,"On my peppers no... As u want them soft and not crunchy, the brine was poured in hot, and then water bathed for ten minutes.  Not sure how broccoli and cauliflower would turn out, but they are also hard crunchy veggies....  Maybe try a small batch both ways?"
867928,misfish,2014-08-16 20:10:00,29133,I wont be doing the broccoli..  Thanks again. G
867938,ketchenany,2014-08-16 21:29:00,3229,"I do  a bushel of roasted peppers every second year. I use the big Shepard peppers. I roast them on the BBQ until charred, remove the the end and freeze them ( I have a vacuum food saver). When we want some, simply defrost and peel off the skin and remove any seeds inside and rinse.  Olive oil fresh chopped parsley Salt to taste And and a clove of garlic cut into 1/4s  Let it sit if possible before eating. Great In a sandwich! Or alone with any meat dish.  BTW I do the recipe books/calendars for Foodland Ontario you see in you local supermarket"
