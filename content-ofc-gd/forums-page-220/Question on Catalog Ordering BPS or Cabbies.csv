Thanks in Advance
868029,kickingfrog,2014-08-17 15:47:00,8333,"Yes the price on BPS is in US dollars. Cabela's does have a .ca site that is in CAN dollars.  When I've ordered on-line from BPS I've been able to see the final cost (taxes, duty, etc) before paying."

868038,kickingfrog,2014-08-17 16:16:00,8333,Lately the free shipping has been for Canada as well.

I believe the free shipping over $75 on the Bass-Pro website would be continental U.S. only.  Cabela's ship to store does not work to Canadian stores if ordering off the US (Cabelas.com) site. They will only ship to US stores from the US site and Canadian stores from the Canadian site.  The BPS shipping deals are to Canada as well. There is an added $3.50 brokerage fee. I have ordered plenty of gear with $0 or $5 shipping from their site. Cabela's shipping deals are continental US only.
