I just spent a week there, watch out for the rocks on the north end there are 2 scholes that will get you if not careful. Try this map for fishing and just be very careful north of grand islandhttps://www.google.ca/search?q=balsam+lake+fishing+map&client=firefox-a&hs=9Ji&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=sb&tbm=isch&imgil=GFxC2l5ibKRpQM%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcS8akXBPTF25_mPB1X-BDFd37ey2wNFZiX5bfsGzNdSPC7NS1aK%253B400%253B327%253BLLQ6-UsZ4Pq8rM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.mnr.gov.on.ca%25252Fen%25252FBusiness%25252FLetsFish%25252F2ColumnSubPage%25252FSTDPROD_081309.html&source=iu&usg=__UqJnizUIZDN9rPmVZfZkJLcPScc%3D&sa=X&ei=YbDZU86CFM2fyATa4YLAAQ&ved=0CCYQ9QEwAw&biw=911&bih=383#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=BU8wDeZ2KrL4hM%253A%3BirIlde_eHF5dRM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.kawarthalife.com%252Fimages%252F10201%252Fbalsam-lake.gif%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.kawarthalife.com%252Fhttp%252F%252Fwww.Kawarthalife.com%252Ffishing%3B550%3B967."
867450,Propwash,2014-08-13 19:57:00,19,"I fish it two to three times a year; Good advice above. Put in at Rosedale.  10-15 weedlines.  Drop-shotting 3 inch gulp minners for bass; slow rolling a smaller spinnerbait by the weed edges will get you some eyes.  I have no luck for musky on this body of water.  That said, my personal best walter came from this lake trolling an 8-inch jointed beleiver in Perch pattern    Good luck."

867479,16 Footer,2014-08-13 21:44:00,191,There is another free launch and parking just on the north side of the Trent canal where it enters Balsam at West bay. I went there for a day in July and found the fishing tough.
867551,ROOK,2014-08-14 10:32:00,55,The launch off Balsam Lake Drive (Trent canal) gets busy quickly as it is a small lot to park in. Some end up parking up on the road actually after launch.  Many fish right out from the Canal entrance and do a good job. Pike ???  everywhere by now so you never know where they may hit !!!!!!!!
867555,Shloim,2014-08-14 11:00:00,515,"Oh I know all about the rocks, did about $3k worth of damage yo my lower unit on balsam, luckily the boat ran after and we finished our week with a boat. That's why I brought it up...Don't even go past the north end of the big Island. There's a guy Hank from the states on here (nicest guy ever) who shared some tips, give me your email and Ill forward his awesome maps."
