867725,FloatnFly,2014-08-15 11:48:00,1640,"one tip i got from a charter captain, was to tilt your rods so that the tips are almost or in the water when making a turn, my guess is that it makes the dipsy run truer.  also, im curious as to why some one would say you need a big boat to run dipsy's?   i know people that run them off an 8ft zodiak, if its leader length, thats a non issue, you have a 7-9ft rod, lift it up a tad, shortens the leader length to 7ft or less, take a step back, or have the net person at the back of the boat, and the leader length is a non issue."
867728,BillM,2014-08-15 12:30:00,17367,"I have a down rigger as well Rick,the thought was to have the #1's to either side far out and than run my#0straight down the back.If that sounds like a not so good idea,I could just run the rigger then.Thanks for the help!  Run the dipys out the side then a rigger.   If I could I'd run riggers over dipsys any chance I got.   I like them, but depth control with riggers is so much easier, plus you can always run a cheater (Which you obviously can't on a dipsy)"
867840,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-16 00:17:00,8243,Riggers rather than dipsy's X2 here Bill. Planner boards over Dipsy's any day for me. I have never had anything good happen with #1's. If not set up it's like reeling in a fridge from 200 yards out. I gave my 1's away. I would love to just be able to run a Dipsy lately. Winds here on Erie have been in the high 20's to 50 KPH for the last 3 weeks. Fishing the Grand for 2 pound Pics isn't going to cut it when limits of 8 pound eaters were not uncommon up to 3 weeks ago. Talk about spoiled.

Johnny D  As far as the Dipsy's go there is also a screw on the underside that puts tension on the setting wheel. One was too loose and it wouldn't hold the setting where I wanted it. Time for me to try those mini planner boards maybe, I haven't had the best of luck with Dipsy Divers but they do work for a few bucks as long as a Bass doesn't make a mess of things.

Ive caught lots of salmon on a dipsy on 0 straight down the chute though!   S."

Davey... that's about what I tend to do as well.  Also, mainline to dipsy I started tying a 12-inch 150lb floro muskie leader between the two.  One time in the first years of using a dipsy I went to pop the release and somehow the 50lb braid got cut off by the dipsy. Never happened again with the leader, and doesn't seem affect fish catching."
867534,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-14 05:14:00,8243,While on the subject why are snubbers used? I've seen them but none of the guys that I longline with use them.

867686,BillM,2014-08-15 01:30:00,17367,"The snubber isn't going to hurt anything, just leave it on..  As long as you keep the middle rod as close to the chute as possible you'll be fine.   I also wouldn't be making any abrupt turns or you'll be tangle in no time.  You might find that running 2 dipsys will be a lot easier then 3."
867716,spincast,2014-08-15 09:41:00,3279,"Yup. If you are running more than two  dispeys,  turns will need to be very slow - watch the outside line track behind the boat and if it is behind you instead of off to the side your turning too tight. You could get away with that if you had one on each side set to 3, but if you had three, you would likely have a cluster by the time you straightened back out again. Can get pretty challenging in an area with a lot of traffic all doing the same thing.  If you have one, a lead core setup down the chute with a dipsey either side is one of my favourite set ups; the bows have a habit of hitting the core half way through the turn."

Two guest have line counters and #1 dipsy's.9' rods as well. The charts that come with them give you a fairly good idea with line out and how deep.This is mostly based on 20lb mono. However,I will be using braid,8/30 power pro to dipsy,12"" snubber and 9' of 15lb fluro leader. Would anyone know what the drop distance would be using 8/30 braid instead of 20lb mono?.The chart says 275'line out  for 40' down.In your experience how much further down would I be using that scale as a guide with braid of course?. Or do I use a lot less line out because of the no stretch issue?.Just a guide or your personal experience using braid or wire lines..I will upgrade my gear as needed,just a test so far,that's why I purchased the smaller #0 dipsy.

As an added tip, when letting the line out, do so by letting the tension off the line. If you open the bail sometimes your line will sink below the dipsy and cause you to have a huge mess.

I would start out in say 60ft of water and let line out until it ticks bottom..(Simcoe is mostly sand you won't hurt anything).  That will be about the easiest way to really figure out how deep/how much line you'll wanna let out.  Davey, a dodger is just a flasher (Similar to a Spin Doctor).
