867036,Moosebunk,2014-08-11 01:23:00,3970,"Hey Bunk  Another amazing trip!!  Thanks for taking the time to do the report, A fantastic write up and pics!  Your comparisons in Bear and Slave is great A lot of really good info.  My favorite is still the Tree,  I just loved your report and pics from that trip.  Cheers Rick  My favorite and Bren's is still the Tree too.  Each trip unforgettable.  Thanks Rick.  Ummm, wow! What a clinic you and bren put on. Thanks for the report, it was very entertaining with some world class lakers involved. Keep in touch Drew.  Thanks Tyler.  While on Nipigon couple weeks ago you crossed my mind, wondered if you made it out there again this year?  Then, this week I'm talking to a buddy about an early fall roady trip and thinking we might rip through the Soo, got wondering again about hooking up.  Not sure it's in the plans though now, may try for later season, but still want to head out that way at some point.  Thought you were coming Ottawa way this summer too?  You got a seat, anytime.  We'll keep in touch man.  Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions. that helps quite a bit!  now I just have to convince a fishing buddy to tag along with me.  It will be worth it.  It's almost a 100% bet I'd make.  With companies like Plummer's they don't need a guy like me trying to sell people on their services as outfitters, their reputation has stood at the top for decades.  But these days, trips like this are becoming easier for people to do.  Airmiles and Aeroplan for flights are an example.  I used points, paid just the taxes ($170) to get two of us from Ottawa to Yellowknife return, with only short stop-overs each way in Calgary.  An easy day of flying for nearly nothing.  That's a start.  As far as outfitters in the Northwest Territories go, here's a little bit of info as well.  Angler tourism in the last 5 years is down from about 7,000 to 4,400 visiting anglers per year.  These are people generally bringing in good money to not only the outfitters, but also airlines and some communities.  This big a drop-off in anglers tracked through outfitting services, one can imagine those visiting as DIY types has declined as well.  The NWT pushes for tourism quite hard, look at SpectacularNWT's adds online and nationally in the Globe,  Lodges and outfitting services don't want to close up shop.  They want to weather the storm, and hope for better days when the U.S. economy/dollar rebounds some, and angler interest grows again.  In the meantime, it's primetime for Canadians, and as so, with some outfitters there may just be some negotiable deals to be had.  A great thing considering angling pressure is lower now than over many years passed, but great services are still there and travel is made easy.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring if the downward trend of visiting anglers continues???   If you and a buddy, or four of you have X number of dollars to spend but think one outfitters price tag is a turnoff, you're making a mistake by not at least picking up the phone and asking what can be done for what you can offer.  Some money in pocket is always better than nothing at all.  Anyways, thanks again folks for the kind replies.  Enjoyed our trip, had to capture it, glad yous enjoyed coming along too."
867051,MJL,2014-08-11 03:40:00,2427,"Just incredible Drew...I imagine after fishing there for lakers, I'd never look at Simcoe the same way again.LOL"

867129,TDunn,2014-08-11 23:25:00,680,"Oh ya! Nipigon on the 28th man! Heading to ORR this time. Try something different. Next year prob back to v falls area in June hopefully. If not I'm thinking South Bay. Ya, I did end up in Ottawa but only for a few days instead of a week like I had planned. I was in town for my sisters wedding and ended up at the heart/crown way to much haha As far as the fall in the Soo. PM me, I like the way this is going. I'm sure I can swing something."

It'd be a real shame that kind of set back with the work you've put into it.  Incredible writing, photos, and fish as always...don't recall getting an invite though!?  AHEM!!!!!!!!   No pike?  Didn't plan on bothering with them at all, although there's some pike fishing to be had there for sure.

Glad u had a great experience  Northern Store shelves are wiped out eh!?!  Can't go nowhere either eh!?!  Remember those days during fall freeze and spring break ups.  Least we could breathe.

866752,Lunkerhunter,2014-08-07 18:28:00,455,amazing report! seeing the smoke and reading about the ambers landing in the water around you while ashes fall from the sky sent shivers through my body.  that is one incredible experience and I hope to one day experience a trip to NWT.  when is the most ideal time to go? I see there is limited dates to choose from but is it better near the end of the time frames?  also is the guide included in the cost?
866756,Lunkerhunter,2014-08-07 18:47:00,455,"one last question. haha as you have been to a few of the lodges at plummers, would you recommend one over the others?"

One falling ember hits your chin and your hairy head would ignite in an atomic blow NASA would report.  But seriously, enjoyed the recap you sent and very happy you got to experience that Doug.  Check one off your bucketlist bud.  that is one incredible experience and I hope to one day experience a trip to NWT.  when is the most ideal time to go? I see there is limited dates to choose from but is it better near the end of the time frames?  also is the guide included in the cost?  Late response here, working, and seriously had to give your next question some thought... Not that I hadn't pondered some on that already...  Most ideal time to go to Slave is last week of July, first two weeks of August.  At least that is what my guide and some other's feel is best.  Lakers are stacked up together best, staging, and in easy to reach location.  Bren and I chose earlier because our girls were being looked after at camp, and also because a friend recommended this earlier period as his favorite time to go.  If choosing Bear for lakers alone, I'd think anytime is a good time to go but I'd probably go second or third week into their open season.  Fishing nearer to the main lodge from what I know is better then, and so are catch numbers. They tend to troll only at Bear and so the fish would be quite shallow then too.  Dave (DRIFTER) used to guide there and he'd be a good one to ask what he thinks best time at Bear is.  Is the guide covered. YES.  But tipping is a must, and that's pointed out in a handbook Plummer's provides when booking.  one last question. haha as you have been to a few of the lodges at plummers, would you recommend one over the others?  I'd recommend both for different reasons. Places like this once they get into you, you're wrecked for life.  Visiting somewhere like the Tree, you'll go years afterwards thinking about it at least once a week...  Price:  Slave wins.  Cheapest package to start with and no added costs with the fly-outs necessary. Main Lodge:  Slave again.  Both are great, though Slave's is nicer with a million dollar view and better fishing right from shore. Rooms:  Both.  Bren's and my cozy Cabin #8 on Bear with the windows looking to the Narakays was our favorite. Staff: Amazing at both lodges. Boats: Same at both lodges. Travel: Slave.  You get to the lodge earliest on day 1 and can have a full days fishing, (half day or so at Bear)  You depart earliest as well final day, and can more easily make one day flights and connections to get all the way home, without the possibility of incurring extra travel costs. Fly-outs: Bear wins. There are no fly outs at Slave. There is some mind-blowing fishing to be had on Bear's fly-outs.  Fishing... it's kinda equal and depends how you want to fish, who you're fishing with and what your goals are.  Through my experience and others the PROS to Slave are...  Jigging.  Using lighter gear, hunting archs on the sonar, playing that game for lakers is more fun to me than trolling, but people catch plenty fish trolling at Slave too. Numbers.  I'd guess Slave consistently boasts better numbers of fish caught by guests over a week long period.  A consideration if taking kids, newbies, spouses... Area.  At Slave the fishing is done much closer to the Lodge.  Travel times in the boat tend not to be as long, again no fly-outs are needed and there's more time fishing. Safety.  I believe there are more protected areas on Slave to fish if the weather turns nasty, and there are never any no-fishing days. Fish.  Slave is a 30+ pound laker factory.  You go there and you have a legitimately excellent chance at fish like this, maybe multiple times over in a week.  Twenties are commonplace as well.  On an ""average"" trip expect your boat to likely catch about 200 lakers, and lose 100 too.  Our guide tells me that 70-80 fish days can happen at Slave... within sight of the Lodge.  Comparing with the PROS of Bear... Trolling.  My wife likes this better as it's more relaxing.  Covering lots of water and taking in the scenery, while pulling lures like Huskys and Flatfish on heavy rods is for most part the Bear life. Numbers.  I haven't put a full week in at Bear because of the Tree, nor gone earlier or late season, nor paid for more than one fly-out to best spots, so I'm not sure what an average weeks catch is, I do however have a friend that's spent numerous weeks on Athabasca, Slave and Bear on different occasions, and he tells me that your numbers go down as your potential for bigger size goes up. Area.  Plenty area to cover near the main lodge, other lodges on the lake you can book into, fly-outs, guided river trips onto the tundra's rivers, the Tree River, with Bear it's an endless world to cover.  You could go on many trips over and over, and do something different, some place different, everyday. Fish.  This is where the serious hunt World Records, and where you have a best shot at a 40+ pound laker on your trip.  20+ pound Arctic char too.  If getting down to business fishing only lakers, I'd probably by a hair choose Slave even despite those hog fish being up at Bear.  If choosing one trip over the other for an overall experience combining all things available, myself and Brenda for sure, everytime, would go to Bear with the Tree.  That's the trip which got us into all this mess to begin with.  Hope that rambling helps ya out."

The road South is still closed and there are nearly 100 rigs on the South side of the closure waiting to bring goods to town. It is a special place, especially when it's isn't all on fire!!!  My friend Susan posted on her FB tonight how she's praying for rain.  How many different fires are actually burning up there now?  Dan while I was there showed me some website that marked red dots on a map as to where the clusters of fires were burning, there was something like 103 fires at the time.  Up behind Niven some place I guess, there's a road that veers off and a popular park or spot for marriages, well that was in trouble last I was there. I really quite like visiting Yellowknife and think it's such a cool place in a cool place... Your fall rains can't come soon enough, although I guess after all these fires burn down the Territory, you should be good for 100 years or more.  And, the fish aren't feeling a thing right now.  Awesome report bunk. That picture with the orange sky in the background is incredible.  My big laker pics great, Bren's big laker pics even better really, but the one shorelunch photo, the orange creamsicle laker shot you speak of and, probably the last grayling pic are definite favorites from the trip.  you should compile all your trips and stuff into a book  Thinking might first need to just archive it some place like a website.  Probably never a book, who'd pay to read my kinda crap. lol.  Fires suck!!!  That's putting it mildly. lol.  Glad to hear the lodge is ok!  Wind shifted the following day after we left, and it came out of the south.  This gave the firefighters a window to back burn the land behind the airstrip and camp, and so they did.  Risky business, they actually started a huge fire to avoid an even bigger fire moving closer.  And so that back burn along with the real fire is what you can view in the final picture.  Once the winds would shift back and pushing the fire towards the lodge again, the land would already have been scorched leaving no fuel for the fire to move forward and burn down Plummers.  It was no miracle this lodge being saved, it was the act of very dedicated and brave souls who risk harm fighting fires.  you can be my guide anytime..  What are we chasing after first bud?   Great that you got to enjoy such a great trip with Bren.  Absolutely me too Tom.  Thanks bud."
