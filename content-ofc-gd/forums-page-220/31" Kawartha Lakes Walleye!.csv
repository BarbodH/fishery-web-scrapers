On one of my casts with the jig and grub I felt the distinct ""Thunk"" as a fish inhaled my jig.....when I set the hook the fish started pulling drag so told my customers I have a Musky on....well, that was until I saw the huge head and white tipped tail then yelled for the net!  This 8.5lb 31"" Walleye is one of the biggest I have taken in the Kawartha's the past 6 years and was nice to get a quick pic of this prime breeder and get her back into the water. The fish hit a smoke coloured grub in 13ft of water along a deep weedline.   Be safe and Good Fish'n... G."

867132,Roy,2014-08-11 23:56:00,13728,"A very nice fish, Greg. Thanks for posting that catch."
867135,chris.brock,2014-08-11 23:59:00,4053,gotta love the full moon Kawartha pics!  nice!
867170,Sinker,2014-08-12 02:55:00,8692,Thats a beauty for the kawarthas! Congrats!  S.
867173,captpierre,2014-08-12 03:08:00,2521,"So Greg, you prefer a grub at the weedline to a bucktail into the weeds?  Or do you do both?  3, 4 or 5 inch?"
867232,Slayingm,2014-08-12 14:13:00,204,"So Greg, you prefer a grub at the weedline to a bucktail into the weeds?  Or do you do both?  3, 4 or 5 inch? I catch a ton of Walleye ripping weeds with bucktail jigs and love using them also.  I stick with 3 and 4"" grubs and minnow style baits and find they work best."
867238,AKRISONER,2014-08-12 14:35:00,5558,"I love the fact that in the kawarthas the slot only allows for smaller fish to be kept, that way monsters like this continue to grow and breed.  Awesome catch"
867244,Freshtrax,2014-08-12 15:00:00,2215,Beauty fish!

Awesome catch Yes the slot is making a huge difference.... over the past few years I am noticing we are boating so many more Walleye in the 20"" + range in lakes like Sturgeon and Balsam which has been great to see."
867497,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-14 00:09:00,8243,"That's a good fish here on big Erie, heck a 30"" plus Walleye is a world class fish anywhere. Kawartha's, never heard of a Pic that size. 10 lbs easy if her girth was filled out. My personal best in the area is 4 pounds at Burley Falls many, many Octobers ago. Even for a guide you must have been very exited. Way to go Sir, well done."
