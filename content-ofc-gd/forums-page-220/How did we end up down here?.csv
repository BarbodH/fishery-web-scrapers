But a day out on the water is a great day out ,no matter the conditions. Getting myself all set up , my bud roars in with his Dodge Ram like he was going to miss the bite or thought maybe he was in the Daytona 500.   I look at the time,OMG, your early.  Setting up the toon in the dark is a bit of a P3TA but I manage.Some of us, just back our rigs to the water, and just unload and go. .  So off we head out. We start with the normal small fish. Some perch and smallies. Once the winds decided to calm enough to head out,we made our way. Jigging from a floating toon with  winds, is not the easiest thing. I try my best to keep my back to the wind and just flip slowing to keep my jig in the finder.  Today was really weird out there though.. NNW winds,current was pushing the jig east. Normal. But when you are thinking you will be heading east with a NNW wind,,you wouldnt expect to be 1 mile WEST of your starting point. It didnt matter if we were in 110 fow or 25 fow,we were being dragged west.  Sorry for the tunes,but Terry was dumb founded as well. We are fishing what looks like calm waters but still were bieng dragged west.    It became frustrating to hold a spot out in the deep waters,(motor or no motor) so we headed back in to play. Lots of good action with big perch and smallies. Smallies were on the small size,but they are fun to play with. The screen was like this all the time. I have,not seen so many big perch this year,as I have this. Simcoe is becoming a fish factory.      The new platform . It,s not finished yet. I wanted to see how it worked before I add a few things to it. I like how the rod holders are out of the way,but easy to exchange up rods when I want to. Leaves the front of the toon wide open for fishing and landing.       The added oar rests are sweet. No drag when flipping my way about.         IT ALL ABOUT HAVING FUN      Tight lines all.
