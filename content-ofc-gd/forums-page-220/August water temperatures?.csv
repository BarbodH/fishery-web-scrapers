868126,turtle,2014-08-18 11:05:00,274,North end of Haliburton last 2 weeks surface temp ranged from 21C down to 17C.  Did better (not great) on the lake trout fishing relatively more shallow.  Caught fish in 30-40 feet on top of mid-lake shoals instead of the ususal off the shoal edge in deeper water.  Did catch one baby trout about 80 feet down on copper.

867762,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-15 16:35:00,8243,"Surface temp here on Erie was 71F last week, less now I would think. Enjoying the fall weather mid August? It feels like the end of September, it smells like it and actually looks like it. Maple, Katulpa and Oak leaves are falling today!  I sure hope I'm wrong but ice fishing here in October?"
867764,esoxansteel,2014-08-15 16:45:00,1307,"Balsam this week ranged from 76.0 degrees on Sunday and Monday to a low of 71.4 on Wednesday, cold nights, and 3 to 3 1/2 footers dropped it,"

The neighbours next door have been in the pool twice this summer. I haven't been in the lake once, no way, no how.  What a beautiful fall day though. Believe it or not there is a tree at the golf club turning colours, I don't know what type it is but it is the first every year to change, mid or end of September though."
867824,Roy,2014-08-15 21:59:00,13728,"Here in my area of the Larry, last week, water temps have hovered between 69F and 72F. That's surface temps."

Crazy year for sure, some trees are already starting to turn and some of the weeds are starting to die off minorly. Hopefully a stretch of warmer weather holds it off?"
