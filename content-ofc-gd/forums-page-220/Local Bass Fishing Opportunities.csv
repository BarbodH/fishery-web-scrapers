We've got a couple of rafts with oars and are looking to catch a few decent fish. Ive read up on a lot of the conservation areas and it seems like Valens offers the best opportunity for fish with a bit of size to them.  Has anyone here had an experience fishing Valens? Are there any decent bass or pike as the ""conservation authority"" says there is?  And ill throw this out here, if anyone is willing to throw me a better local secret bass spot ill be forever in your debt"
