867489,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-13 23:20:00,8243,"If there is reincarnation I want to return to this Earth as Shirley Shirley. I will have a chance of travelling to the most beautiful places on this planet and fish. And I can hit from the ladies ""T's"".........  Truly a cornucopia of some strange looking critters. When will it air, next year most likely?"

867528,Moosebunk,2014-08-14 03:33:00,3970,"As always Aaron, some crisp pics and a great write up.  The mouth waters with the thought of halibut... but add some boatside BBQ, some cheerleaders and salmon too and you certainly do have heaven.  Great opportunities for you dood!  Enjoy."
867617,Rod Caster,2014-08-14 18:22:00,5784,"Great read and photos!  Aside from the fish, my favorite part of the ocean is scouting the shoreline and looking for 'things'. So much life and cool stuff to be found"
867627,msp,2014-08-14 18:46:00,1336,Looks like a great time. Thanks for posting Quick question....... How do you like the rapala rain suit that you are wearing? Saw it in the store and was thinking of purchasing one Thanks
867635,Cast-Away,2014-08-14 19:07:00,790,"Totally Amazing Aaron, what a variety of fish and you got some really good closeup shots of so many different creatures. Your cabins looks very similar to one that I stayed at in Tofino."
867682,Joeytier,2014-08-15 00:47:00,3990,Amazing!!!  You got to experience the whole smorgasboard of the Pacific coast of Canada.
867709,Aaron Shirley,2014-08-15 05:25:00,655,"Thanks everyone, it was truely a spectacular trip, and one I really looked forward to!  Old Iron maker,  the show will air on Sportsnet next year.  MSP the Rapala rain suit is terrific. It is truely waterproof, breathable, wind proof, lightweight and comfortable. I have older Lund suits that are pretty good but they are too heavy for summer. The Rapala rain suits are perfect. I'd rather put on a hoodie underneath on cooler spring or fall days and have the option to wear it in the summer. I like the weatherproof zippers and hand warmer pockets as well."
