We've been spending every spare minute since Mid June up there.. countless loads in.. every favor I could possibly call in used.. lol.. Only twice on the water all summer....BUT were back in business, and get to spend the last week of the summer up at camp for our 25th anniversary.. with the kids before they go off to school.  Im a happy feller, what a relief to be done. Just some tweaking left to finish!  (and a new crapper to boot!)  From This:        To THIS!!                             "
