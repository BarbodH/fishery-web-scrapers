867089,Joey,2014-08-11 17:16:00,9122,"Well once again, we had a fab time up at Maskinonge Lodge.  Regan and Goldie are the best hosts and the cabins are great.  We arrived after a trip from hell where right off the bat, the passenger side window broke, so we had to keep stopping to put paper in it or it would keep sliding down, which sucks on the highway.  Then we got another flat (good thing we bought a new spare) and had to change it just before Barrie (which was a 3 hour drive just from Richmond Hill).   So, lets just say, the drive up was unpleasant and ended up being 6 hours instead of the usual 3 1/2 to 4 hrs.  Just as we were pulling into the camp, I saw the Sandhill Cranes I have been trying to get a picture of for a long time.  Paul stopped for me and I went running to get a picture, which of course scared them, so these were the best I could get as they took off.

But Paul did manage to get a nice 46"" musky and my son got a few pike.    I got a few pike aswell, but as usual, the cameraman never gets any pics taken of themselves.  IMG_1454 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   I think he's happy in  this picture  IMG_1452 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  My son and his mini pike  IMG_1461 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   Another one a bit bigger, which we kept for the fish fry.  Thanks Patsy for doing the major work on that.  Ralphie loves when we catch fish  IMG_1465 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  IMG_7133 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr    We got a huge thunderstorm and barely made it back to camp.  It rolled in and gave us a good light show.

Could not have had better company than we had and can't wait to do it all again next year.   Thanks all for such a good time.  Thanks Regan and Goldie for the BBQ and for being such awesome camp owners.   I think your place is going to do well.  We will definitely be back.  Joey      "

867153,chris.brock,2014-08-12 01:33:00,4053,"looks like the who's who of the OFC up there  great pics as usual, not enough Ralphie  shots though, to remind me of my old Boston (I know Ralphie isn't a Boston, but they look similar)"
867576,Moosebunk,2014-08-14 12:43:00,3970,"Get a fall flock of sandhills flying over and all that honking will have ya diving for cover.  As always Joey, enjoy your photos."
867580,Regan Thompson,2014-08-14 13:17:00,80,"Great having you up as always Joey.  And great photography once again.  Which reminds me, you still need to teach me how to use my camera out of auto mode!  Looking forward to seeing you guys again in the fall."
867665,Fisherpete,2014-08-14 22:01:00,1814,"Very nice pics Joey, and that is a solid muskie that Paul caught! One of these years I will make it up to Nip...  Pete"
