867817,misfish,2014-08-15 21:24:00,29133,  I was being serious Dave.
867818,Roy,2014-08-15 21:27:00,13728,Sit front to back. Or it could work if your knees bent the other way.
867820,Terry,2014-08-15 21:45:00,14456,"every time I swim with flippers on, they push me forward , it would be hard  to swim in reverse  lol"
867821,misfish,2014-08-15 21:52:00,29133,"Told ya a stupid question.LOL  I have tried to tuck my knees right under my seat and flip. It works well for holding on a spot,but travel sucks,but it,s a work out.LOL  Looks like another thing I will have to work on. Im sure I can fabricate something that will work."
867822,Rodbender,2014-08-15 21:54:00,1027,Flippers no trolling motor yes
867823,misfish,2014-08-15 21:58:00,29133,"Flippers no trolling motor yes  Yes.  Trolling motor is on the back burner for now RB. Still fabricating for that ,but it,s coming along just fine so far. Need to try the platform out first."
867825,Rodbender,2014-08-15 22:00:00,1027,you'll have to make flippers come off your heel's that could be akward

867833,davey buoy,2014-08-15 22:53:00,5505,A paddle wheel would be the cats  .Could you imagine.Time to engineer one Brian  .
867983,John Bacon,2014-08-17 06:09:00,3277,Cabela's used to sell some called Kickapoo Kickers.  It does not look like they are made anymore... perhaps there is a reason for that.  I did see these. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fishmaster-style-paddle-pushers-tube-fishing-fins-kickers-/161075124953?pt=US_Taxidermy&hash=item2580d35ad9
867984,misfish,2014-08-17 08:29:00,29133,Interesting. Looks like you open and close your legs to propel those.  Thanks JB.
868002,Musky or Specks,2014-08-17 13:00:00,2710,I just always turn around and kick to where I need to go. I can't see moving forward in a tube being done efficiently.
