So my knowledge of this lake isn't exactly great, but I'll give you as much info as I can. We've always camped on one of the many crown land islands. The fishing can be hit or miss. I've never been up there in August, so I can't tell you what to expect for this time of year. But I do know that it is a very picturesque and peaceful place and if your looking to relax, then this is the spot. I hope others can chime in because I'd love to hear more. I hope I'm able to get up there next year. Good luck and enjoy !"
