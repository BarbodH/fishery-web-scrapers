867561,mistaredone,2014-08-14 11:55:00,913,I have a buddy flying in from the East coat and he wants to do some fly fishing on the Grand river up near Elora. I'm totally not a fly fisherman by I'm going to give it a go. We are heading out this Saturday but looking at the forecast we might get 10mm of rain. Will this blow out the river or stain it to the point it's not worth fishing?  Like I said I have little to no stream fishing experience. Any advice would be appreciated.

867633,mistaredone,2014-08-14 19:00:00,913,"Ok, I found a site full of info that makes now sense to me lol so I'll just find out the old fashioned way."

It might be a little late notice but if he gets your email he will bend over backwards to get you onto the fish. He sells at Proctor Marine during the summer as he teaches and has summers off, he may be there, give him a call at the Marine as well."
