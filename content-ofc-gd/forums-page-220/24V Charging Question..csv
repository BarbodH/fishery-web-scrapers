867657,RickOnt,2014-08-14 21:17:00,669,"Hey Bunk  I am not gonna get in a pissing match about 'Terminology' or 'Definitions'  You can charge a 24 volt system, consisting of 2 ,12Volt batteries with one charger, However it might be slow.  The simplest way is to get an onboard 2 bank charger and hook it up to both batteries to charge both at the same time.  OR  Get a 3 bank and also charge the starting battery.  I unplug the Terrova before plugging in the charger and no need to disconnect batteries  You are gonna love the Terrova 24 volt 80 lbs thrust  with remote and I-pilot   It works as advertised   Cheers Rick"

Enjoyed testing my buddy Len's out a couple times in the past and so picked one up in April.  Going to appreciate it methinks.  Enjoy the new setup! Im jealous!!  It's overdue Sink.  The 55PD has been put through the ringer for nearly 5 years and is still going fine but, the extra power is actually needed sometimes, and the features with this will go a long to help me out with certain species fished.  Keeping the PD for now, it'll likely go on whatever smaller boat replaces the WarCanoe.  Drew dude. FLIPPER POWER MANG. Nice addition dude.  Hear ya bud.  Flippin' about might help loosen the belt too. lol.  Haven't been in the tube yet this year tho Brian.  Usually do at least a little spring troutin' and fall back lake bassin' from the Outcast."
867663,Garnet,2014-08-14 21:57:00,2056,I have a 2 bank 10 amp charger that I use for my starting battery. I use all 4 leads on 1 battery that gives me 10 amp charge.  My 3 bank that I bought before the 4 bank came out is a 30 amp that's 10 amp per battery.  If you every get into a boosting situation then you need to un hook the jumper between battery's.
867664,misfish,2014-08-14 21:57:00,29133, Lose of 20 this year so far bud. Who would of thunkit. Lose weight while enjoying fishing.
867666,grimsbylander,2014-08-14 22:06:00,3016,Good job Brian! Other than my wallet I haven't lost weight pumping gas. I should get one just for the health benefits.

867687,Terry,2014-08-15 01:30:00,14456,it's ok I know I'm right I was just happy to correct you guys
867688,moxie,2014-08-15 01:37:00,1566,"Upgraded the trolling motor.  Running two deep cycle 12 volts in series for 24 volts.  Everything working mint, batteries separately charge to 13.1 equally and are about the same age and use.  I haven't run a 24V set-up before.  I have an Eliminator Intelligent 12V Charger so when needing to charge these batteries do I disconnect all, some, or no connections, and charge each battery alone or in some other way?  Guessing the 12V's will need to be charged separately? Water got muddied in a hurry didn't it? Arent you glad you asked?"
867689,Moosebunk,2014-08-15 01:52:00,3970,"Ahhhh Mox... in the end I got the answers bud.    Was a little muddy myself with what's best to do for charging.  With what I've got at home to charge with now, each 12V will be separately charged, I'll leave the two connected and see what happens first couple times around, and I'll unplug the motor because I'm used to doing that anyways.  Gotta thank the lot of OFC'ers for speaking up and explaining what they know and do for themselves.  All good doods!!!"

867721,Gerry,2014-08-15 10:43:00,257,"I've owned a boat with an onboard charger for the past 20+ years and I've never unplugged the trolling motor......that would be a major pain in the butt for me. I've had a Lund proV with a 24V trolling motor, a Triton with a 24V, and the current boat being a Ranger with a 36V. The trolling motor stays plugged in and so does the onboard charger when the boat is in my garage.....even over the winter months."
867722,Roy,2014-08-15 10:54:00,13728,"Gerry has it figured. I plug my boat in when I get home and it's good to go, anytime."
867723,ecmilley,2014-08-15 11:32:00,2163,On my ranger I have a 24vt maxxum four wires run up to the marinco plug the system gets put into series by the trolling motor plug. For charging I put the marinco charging plug on a extra long cable and hook it to a 12 vt charger. It charges in parallel no problems with charging and the cheap way out
867733,Garnet,2014-08-15 13:05:00,2056,I'm the same I never un plug my 36 volt trolling. It's likely a good idea. Put I don't.
867838,Moosebunk,2014-08-15 23:57:00,3970,"    LOVED IT!!!  Terrova Power.  Don't know why I didn't do this in the beginning.  Nothing fancy this newer set-up.  With a couple L-brackets just rigged up a little platform on a Lund bracket so I could run the old Humminbird 585 on the bow.  No drilling, wires stowed away, and it can be disconnected and moved to the back where I can use it as the GPS beside the HDS7 if wanting to be all fancy like the Pros.  FYI... DID NOT switch out the 8 guage wire running to the batteries at the back of the boat.  Online and in question was the need for 6 AWG for this motor.  Thought I might have to, but the Minnkota Terrova owners manual noted it is not necessary.  8 AWG is fine for the 80# with less than 40 feet of wire.  Ran it today full out for about 4-5 minutes into a little wind and did not find the wire by the batteries and breaker warmed as all.  Gotta be careful with this motor on my smaller boat though, if it's turned right or left and set to speed 10, it'll throw people out. lol. "

867616,Terry,2014-08-14 18:20:00,14456,so it's a one bank charger I take it  if so just charge one at a time you don' t need to disconnect anything
867618,BillM,2014-08-14 18:22:00,17367,"You'll need to remove the link between both batteries before charging them.   What I'd do is just get a on board 24V charger and be done with it.  Guest makes some nice ones, not very expensive either."
867621,Moosebunk,2014-08-14 18:35:00,3970,"It is a one bank Terry.  Two sorta different answers here, but regardless for now I'll be charging each separately by the sounds of it.  Easy to get at these batteries.  Will likely go with an onboard eventually, for now just want to get out there and play.  55PD up to 80Terrova should be fun on the Rebel.  Thanks doods."
867622,Terry,2014-08-14 18:35:00,14456,i have never removed the link and never found any problems however unplugging the trolling motor doesn't hurt

Of course, because he'll be using a 24V charger   Same setup I use, 1 bank to bat #1, 2nd bank to bat #2, works great.  The only time I left anything connected with two batteries was when I was charging 2 12V in parallel in a 12V system.    But hey, whatever works to get those batteries charged."

867637,Garnet,2014-08-14 19:19:00,2056,You got it wrong Bill. A 2 bank charger is 2-12 volt chargers in 1 box.  A 24 volt charge whole different animal.

867640,Terry,2014-08-14 19:31:00,14456,"i must say I have never seen one call itself a 24v charger , when it's a 2 bank charger @ 12v per bank nor 36v for a 12v  3 bank charger"
867641,Garnet,2014-08-14 19:37:00,2056,Each lead is 12 volt that's 12 to the first battery and 12 to the second battery. It also says 12 amp your first set of leads is 6amp and the second is 6amp the only way to get 12 amp is both sets of leads to 1 battery.
867642,BillM,2014-08-14 19:39:00,17367,"i must say I have never seen one call itself a 24v charger , when it's a 2 bank charger @ 12v per bank nor 36v for a 12v  3 bank charger  My Guest listed 12v/24V right on the box.   There's really no point in charging the entire circuit at one time with a single lead., it would take way longer.  One lead to each battery is definitely the way to do it."
867643,grimsbylander,2014-08-14 19:58:00,3016,"The confusion is in the terminology. Bill's right in saying he has a 24V charger because that what the marine industry adopted when you have two batteries connected...thus the 24V electric motor. But, at the battery level it's still only 12V each. Bill's charger cannot charge a true 24V battery. It can charge two 12V batteries connected in series for 24V total OR two 12V batteries not connected for 12V EACH.  I have a 4 bank charger...36V TOTAL for the trolling motor batteries and 12V for the cranking battery. It is NOT a 48V charger in reality.  Oh so Moosebunk...you can absolutely charge your batteries without disconnecting them from each other. You will have to hook up the positive and negative to only ONE battery at a time though. If you put the positive to one battery and the negative to the other you will in essence be only charging 6.5V to each.  Also, I have a Motorguide digital motor and was told to always unplug it when charging. So just out of curiosity I called Minn Kota and got told the same thing. The new motors have circuit boards whereas the old motors were simple 12V wired systems. When charging, you batteries will be brought up to as high as 14.5V. This can damage the boards as the 30 or 40 amp circuit breaker is in no way going to protect against a voltage spike. In addition, it does the motor no good to have the circuit board energized full time."
