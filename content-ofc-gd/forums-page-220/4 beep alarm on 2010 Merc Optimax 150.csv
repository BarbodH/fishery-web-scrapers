868322,Regan Thompson,2014-08-19 12:10:00,80,Hi All - Anyone have an Opti that can help me troubleshoot this?  Just after adding more Optimax oil to my reservoir I started getting warning beeps (4 of them) every two minutes.  The owners manual says this means low oil or water in gas.  I'm sure it's no coincidence that it started happening after I just added oil so just wondering if it's a sensor or pressure thing?  Anyone out there ever get this and/or know what to do?  Much Thanks
