I have been out quite a few nights until midnight catching teeny tiny bass and crappies out of the Grand River in Brantford.  This weekend the girlfriend and I are looking to for a place to catch a couple of fish and maybe cook something up Saturday night for my birthday.  So...this leads into my question...where is a decent spot (fishing from shore as have no boat) to catch something worth eating?  (Fish out of the Grand at least in Brantford sort of freaks me out).  Anything between Brantford and Niagara Falls since we will likely end up in Grimsby for the night anyways.  I was thinking about heading to St. Johns Woods out in Fonthill for a hike and a bit of fishing in the stocked pond unless someone offers an alternative."

I don't really fish in that area too much but there are quite a few other spots. Lots on the grand river all the way from brantford to dunnville"
