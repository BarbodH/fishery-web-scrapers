859235,mattp33,2014-06-18 15:44:00,290,"So I saw these super cool LED boat lights from Bluewater at Bass Pro and they were on sale.  Well I have wanted to light up my compartments for a while so I grabbed them.      So on the box it says it has  4 20 inch compartments, when I got it home and opened it it only had 4 10 inch lights.  When I called Bluewater they simply said it was a typo on the box, after a very long pause (me waiting for her to tell me how we are going to fix) She said have a nice day and hung up the phone.  The customer service was horrible and non-existant.  I called back to simply find out weather I could order the 4 20 inch strips I need and she said that the shipping to canada would be very expensive and to just buy another kit.  Well then I have lots of light i dont want and still no 20 inch compartment lights.  I will make this work so I started to install some of them last night.      The livewell lights are going to be awesome.  All the compartments will be white light and the decl will be blue.  I also made this Devider yesterday as when I got the boat it didn't have 1.  The fish were so hard to get out as they had a lot of room to swim.  I had a lot of trouble drilling holes in it.  Anyone know an easy way?  Also should I make more holes up higher just incase the water sloshes around while on the water.    First compartment is lit, more to follow  I used these tap conectors to tie into power from the stern light.  This comes on when my anchor light switch is turned on.  The deck lights will be on a seperate switch.    I have a lot of wiring to do over the next few days!  Stay tuned for more pics"

859251,mattp33,2014-06-18 17:24:00,290,"It is kinda duanting to start for sure, I am going to take my time and plan, plan and plan some more"
859263,DanD,2014-06-18 18:40:00,2223,When you're doing the rewiring get rid of the Scotchloc connectors; they have to be the worse for corrosion and rotting wiring. Use an un-insulated barrel connectors or solder along with shrink tube. It'll save you a whole bunch of grief in the future.  Dan.  
859265,misfish,2014-06-18 18:57:00,29133,"X2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Good start though Matt.  As for the devider. I would make larger holes 1', and take it up to about 3 inches of the top. Use a hole saw. Are you using lexan or pex? I would go with lexan. Stronger and easy to drill."
859269,mattp33,2014-06-18 19:17:00,290,"I think its plex, I got it for cheap so I didnt argue lol  I do think I need more or bigger holes.  I thought these conectors were the easiest way to go, I jammed dielectric greese in them?  This is the very starting point for power to these lights so I will take your advice and change them to prevent future probs  Thanks for the advice"
859270,misfish,2014-06-18 19:20:00,29133,"Cheap is right. For the size of the devider,I would pick up a piece of lexan.  JMO  If you want to take it one step further,Look for nylon."
859273,mattp33,2014-06-18 19:39:00,290,"I'm not looking forward to doing that again lmao!!!  If it breaks then I will start looking for something else, it was a lesson in frustration trying to fit that.  The livewell does not have a straight,flat or level side to it!!!"
859278,misfish,2014-06-18 19:48:00,29133,"I'm not looking forward to doing that again lmao!!!  If it breaks then I will start looking for something else, it was a lesson in frustration trying to fit that.  The livewell does not have a straight,flat or level side to it!!!  Thats why you use cardboard to work out your template. Once you have the fit then you cut and make a nice fit."
859282,Sinker,2014-06-18 19:53:00,8692," Yep, this ^.  Get rid of those. They will cause you grief for sure.  S."
860949,mattp33,2014-06-30 18:50:00,290,Finally got around to intstall the rest of the compartment lights in the boat over the weekend.  Also fixed some rookie wiring mistakes        I am very happy of how it turned out.  I even got out to smallmouth country and got my first few smallies of the year.  Nothing big but a strong healthy simcoe smallie
