867333,Roy,2014-08-12 23:19:00,13728,I'd still go to Luremaking.com..... they're not far away from you. Deal online with them.  They really know what they're doing. The service is fantastic. Very friendly and explain everything. Give me a shout if you need anything in particular.

867904,Big Cliff,2014-08-16 17:11:00,6899,"I just started making my own spinner baits this year and love it. Nothing better than catching a fish on one of your own hand made baits. One thing I would suggest though is get a good pair of round nose pliars for bending your loops, they do a much nicer job. They are not easy to find, I tried a couple of places and finally ordered them from luremaking.com."

I plan on mainly using the open loop on mine."

It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!"
