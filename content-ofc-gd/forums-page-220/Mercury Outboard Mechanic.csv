It is about time really considering the bouncing around it takes going down the trails over the last 10 years . She doesn't owe me anything !!! Anyways , I have fuel coming out the carb and I would assume it would be a float issue but not sure . Funny thing is , is that it runs perfect except when I idle right down . It feels like it wants to choke out as well there is a small amount of fuel leaking out the carb as previously noted . I am going to fire it up today and let it run a bit to see if it there is still a problem , maybe the ride out on my last trip jarred something in the carb and somehow no more problem (doubt it though) If all else fails , does anyone know of a good outboard mechanic in the Barrie area that could help me out . Thanks"

867251,Roe Bag,2014-08-12 15:40:00,246,Try tapping the float bowl gently but rapidly with a screwdriver handle. From either side if possible.Sounds as though the float is stuck a little high and it's flooding out at low speed. A good dose of SeaFoam can't hurt. Good luck.

Ran great after awhile but still noticed fuel leaking out of engine . Did some investigating and noticed a fuel line at the bottom of the carb. had a pin hole leak , cut it out and replaced back on carb and bingo . Good as new    Thanks for the help guys , good for another ten years !"
