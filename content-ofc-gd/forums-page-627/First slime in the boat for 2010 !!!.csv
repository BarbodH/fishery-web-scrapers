506387,Lunker777,2010-09-24 15:28:00,866,"Hey everyone  I just wanted to share a pic of my buddies first Musky Earlier this summer, we were bass fishing out on St.Clair and he hooked into a smaller but VERY nice looking tiger musky..... My stupidity got the best of me while tryin to land the fish and I snapped the line.... he then told me he had never caught a Musky before !!! haha so not only did I lose a $10 lure, but I also lost a big fish for him !  So... I owed him big time ! haha well on Sunday we decided to hit the river for some trolling action....  Not 15 minutes into our trip the rod goes off.....    and we land this beaut... No official measurment but I would say approx 45"" +/-  Thanks for looking !"
506398,Grimace,2010-09-24 15:55:00,2020,Well done.  Good looking specimen.
506447,Leecher,2010-09-24 18:11:00,7832,He must be happy now    Nice ski for sure Thanks for sharing Leechman

506480,TC1OZ,2010-09-24 19:20:00,987,Wow! Epic fish! Awesome that you got it so quick into the trip! I bet the rest of the trip was a downer lol.
506484,Lunker777,2010-09-24 19:31:00,866," hahah Well i am sitting down when I took the pic, so it looks bigger then it is ! But he called it @45 so if he is happy its all good ! ... the more I think about it, the more I wish I had my tape with me ! haha   hahah well it was only an hour and a half or so trip... but we had one more nice rip but by the time we got the rods in hand, it was gone !!!"

506486,stubbex1,2010-09-24 19:37:00,164,nice fish....wish i had the time to head down there this fall....crops are early this year
506489,Lunker777,2010-09-24 19:46:00,866, Well now I feel bad for not gettin a true length for him !! His first ever musky could be a trophy !!!!! haha
506494,muskeybugged,2010-09-24 19:54:00,282,"Judging by head size..... Length from the fin under the gill, to the belly fin and the straining expression on your buddies face ..... my calculations have it at 49 7/8""!!!!  Calling it 50"" wouldn't get an argument outta me!"
