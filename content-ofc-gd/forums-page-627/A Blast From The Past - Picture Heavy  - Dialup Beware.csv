I promise  Ice fishing is what I truly enjoy and in my younger days was a real fanatic about it..... didn't matter what temperature, I was all out enjoying freedom  Here's me and a friend of mine.... notice the big fish on the stringer in front of me     first biggest eye that I got mounted    Here's the mount    next is a sturgeon I caught.... 49""   and here I'm trying to hold it but he didn't like it    Now that he was behaving    Specks on ice are my favorite's    and double headers doesn't happen often    Next few pics are random....    How bout it for running & gunning      Limit of walleyes    Softwater shots random....
