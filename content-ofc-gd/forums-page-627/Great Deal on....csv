507595,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-28 11:53:00,2690,"If I remember correctly, Bill M has one as well, and,highly recommended it when I was searching for one a little while back.  Still haven't purchased one, this is ""mighty tempting""!!"
507604,The JAY,2010-09-28 12:53:00,239,"I bought the CS, not the CSx, since I don't like the barometric altimeter, but otherwise it's identical... Oh, and I love this unit! Looking back, maybe the barometer would have been a good idea for trending pressure for fishing, but such is life.... You can't go wrong with these units, especially at a price like that."
507608,BillM,2010-09-28 13:15:00,17367, You are correct.  I love my unit..  Everything from bushwacking into Chapleau back lakes to using BlueCharts out on Simcoe in the winter for lakers and whities..   Absolutely love it.
