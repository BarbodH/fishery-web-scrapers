I enjoyed the 1st episode of his new show this morning and hopefully he does really well with it.  Best of luck my friend !!   "
507686,mistyriver1,2010-09-28 16:10:00,600,"I've been chatting with Jamie through e-mails the last few days.  I really liked the show, I hope it does well.  It's a different concept and a breath of fresh air."
507712,PikeMolester,2010-09-28 18:13:00,428,it was alright. No idea why they'd show freakin HALIFAX for the premiere.
507727,Leecher,2010-09-28 19:13:00,7832, Lew I love the look a like    Sounds like Jamie's quite the comedian   I couldn't agree more with you Jim   May be they wanted to keep the best for last
507826,jediangler,2010-09-29 00:50:00,1923,I think maybe they are going geographically east to west across the country.
