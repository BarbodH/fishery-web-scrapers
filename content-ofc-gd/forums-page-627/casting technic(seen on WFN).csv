507512,mercman,2010-09-28 00:45:00,7054,watching wfn. i've notice the guys casting bait casters with both hands.What does this give compared to one hand casting. more distance or control.
507515,Muskieman,2010-09-28 00:53:00,2472,"Once again, It all depends what I have at the end of my leash.. Say a light spoon or a crank ..one hander. 2 hands for more distance or against the wind. If I have a large bait on I'll most all of the time use a 2 handed cast..(strictly overhand)...  I myself find the one hander more accurate..and versatile.  Randy "
507528,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 01:09:00,5784,"My friend swears by the one handed cast, makes fun of me for using two hands. I get amazing accuracy with two hands so I stick with it. BTW I use a spincast."
507531,mercman,2010-09-28 01:19:00,7054," Thanks Randy. I just subscribed to wfn last nite.Gonna help pass the cold hibernation months.Seen a few strange things, like why do they bonk the fish on the side of the head before taking the hook out."
507534,Muskieman,2010-09-28 01:32:00,2472,"""like why do they bonk the fish on the side of the head before taking the hook out. ""      Randy "
507536,mercman,2010-09-28 01:39:00,7054,im serious dude !! watched a show where the guy slapped the fish upside its head then took the hook out  i cant figure  it out.....
507537,Muskieman,2010-09-28 01:47:00,2472,"Sorry, I thought that you were kidding..  I have no clue why someone would bonk a fish to get the hook out unless he's keeping it.. Do you remember what show you were watching?  Randy "
507543,HTHM,2010-09-28 01:59:00,4082,"A bonk on the head will have the same effect on a fish as on a person, temporarily stun them, or kill them depending on the blow, and it makes the fish struggle less when taking the hook out."
507544,Muskieman,2010-09-28 02:02:00,2472,"Come to think of it.. I may know why.  I remember being a kid and throwing a fit with arms flailing and all .. my Mom would bonk me on the head or or give me a light slap on the cheek to calm me down.. so she could ""take the hook out""  If it worked on me .. It might work on a flailing fish... I'll try it next time.  Randy "
507545,mercman,2010-09-28 02:03:00,7054," scott martin challenge. i chuckled a bit when he kept telling the fish to quiet down.i guess it didnt listen so he smacked it, took the hook out and let it go.  Paul"
507546,mercman,2010-09-28 02:07:00,7054, mine used to dig her nails into my arm.You try smackin and i'll try diggin my nails in.then we'll compare notes
507554,Garry2Rs,2010-09-28 02:40:00,1425,"I cast bait-casters with two hands, that's the way I started as a kid and the habit stuck.  In a practical sense, I think that two hands makes sense, since it puts my left in position to take the hand-off as the rod goes from right to left.  I generally change hands while the bait is in the air and thumb with my left, most of the time.  I also cast spinning rods with two hands...It just seems like it's easier to aim that way...it feels steadier...like a rifle vs a sixgun.  Fish abuse makes no sense to me, but then I never slapped my kids either."
507564,highdrifter,2010-09-28 03:11:00,2534,"Same thing as a haul cast in flyfishing...  In this case, you'd pull in the butt section as you're making your forward swing.  It increases the speed of your swing, much like a teeter..  Does this make sense?!?!  Don't make me draw you a diagram boy.."
507590,mercman,2010-09-28 11:03:00,7054,  yaza boss....makes perfect sense
507591,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-28 11:12:00,1622,"Hey Mercman I think Scott was hitting the jig head with the palm of his hand & then taking the hook out, when the hook is in good it's easier to get out if you give it a quick slap Richard"
507596,mercman,2010-09-28 11:54:00,7054,  maybe.i'll keep watchin.Maybe i'll get a better look next time. WFN is an excellent chanel.I may have loads of questions in the future. I've been out of the loop for a long time.
507801,thefireman,2010-09-28 23:56:00,51,   THANK YOU Richard!  That is exactly what they are doing.
507855,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-29 02:53:00,1107,  What he said
507923,PainInTheBass,2010-09-29 15:26:00,102,I find I have more control and power using 2 hands.  I am not comfortable at all casting one handed.  I have seen the palm smack the jig head technique on FishTV as well.
507928,mercman,2010-09-29 15:44:00,7054,"  thanks for all the feedback. I tried double handed and it feels a little akward, but i do get more distance. The wife is giving it a try too. Back in july when she started fishing, she was using 1 hand and trew her whole rod and reel into 30ft of water.Now she attached the cord from the deadman switch from my motor to her rod and her lifejacket.Maybe with 2 hands i'll get my cord back."
507945,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-29 17:07:00,0,"Always one handed for me, far more accurate in my situation. Never felt comfortable two handed, at all. I've also never had the urge to cast 300ft from the shore/boat"
507994,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-29 22:34:00,0,"I use 2 hands. More distance, better control(and probably easier on the arms). If I'm flippin and pitchin, I use one hand."
