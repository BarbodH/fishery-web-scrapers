491614,bongo,2010-08-05 15:24:00,67,"All the things you guys have said about the Notty are very true. It does take some persistence to get over the murky and log jammed waters, however that's also good cover for steelhead, I don't know if Salmon really look for cover but great for the other fish.  One thing I will say about the Notty, it's got some of the hardest fighting steelhead in southern Ontario, I'm glad they made Angus to Alliston a no kill Rainbow zone"
491732,bill smy,2010-08-05 22:07:00,31,Exaxtly why i fish it as it is my closest steelhead river.
492102,Drock6687,2010-08-06 22:33:00,90,So im off in two week..the week of Aug 14th...if we get a little rain next week would it be worth my time to spend a couple hours in the notty in wasaga and see if theres anything there yet?
492109,Rustic-Fisher,2010-08-06 23:15:00,826,"Sporadic at best! we're not even seeing them near the mouths yet on g-bay, but that could all change in a week. I am thinking a late run this year.  How about tapping into the Smallmouth which are plentiful in the gbay tribs. Having said that, GO for it!!!  you never know. Tight lines, R"
492110,Fisherman,2010-08-06 23:16:00,7201,"All depends on Mother Nature and maybe a shot of good luck.  I work in that general area and check the Pine River daily, if it was any lower the soles of my feet wouldn't get wet crossing it. Oh, and have not seen a salmon or rainbow yet, little minnows and creek chub are it.  If I see any, I'll post."
492209,bongo,2010-08-07 04:11:00,67,"Rivers are incredibly warm this year on GBay, I wouldn't waste my time there for at least another 3 or 4 weeks. When people stated that they have seen Salmon run up the Notty in past years in late July and early August, usually meant that the river's temps were cool. Salmon need oxygenated water to come up the rivers, and only colder temperature water really have that."
492229,12footspringbok,2010-08-07 10:15:00,459, By the 14th there will be a few making their way up. Its not just rain that pushes salmon into the notty. A strong North wind will definatly push fish into the mouth. Also a cool night or two like last night will get them running too.
492238,Twocoda,2010-08-07 11:50:00,4130,  you can still get em in owen sound ...but not as plentiful...  the geen has turned a few salmon already so i would expect the notty to be on track
492247,Drock6687,2010-08-07 14:50:00,90,This may be a stipid question but what kind of salmon run in the notty from wasaga?  I have only ever fished for steelhead so this whole salmon thing is new to me.
492248,wallacio,2010-08-07 14:55:00,475, Mostly Chinooks - the Notty has a self-sustaining population and the majority of them spawn in the Pine.  Unfortunately the runs are only a shadow of what they used to be prior to the baitfish crash around 2003.    The Notty used to get huge numbers of very respectable sized fish (20lbs+ were not uncommon).
492349,Musky or Specks,2010-08-07 23:53:00,2710,Did a little assessment work on a small trib of the Mad. It was jam packed with juvenile chinook smolts. In August. Survival rates from spawn to September were incredible
507637,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 14:07:00,5784,  Sorry to revive a topic like this but I'd like to clarify something. Zone 16 regs say that Rainbows are closed after Sept 30th. Seems like a few guys are saying that they fish the fall (saw some pics of fish on ice too). Are these rules new this year? Are guys fishing even though the season is closed? Is rainbow off season different that say a Bass off season where your allowed catch and release?
507642,kickingfrog,2010-09-28 14:11:00,8333, Check the exceptions and year round fishing opportunities in the regs. A section of the notty is open year round for steelhead.
507645,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 14:24:00,5784,"  Thank you for pointing that out, I just found it."
490722,Drock6687,2010-08-03 01:31:00,90,I have only ever been a trout fisherman but im thinking this fall I am going to go out and try to get my first salmon...when do they leave georgian bay and go back into the nottawasaga river?  I was thinking late september but thats a compleate guess
490734,alexcba,2010-08-03 02:20:00,634,depends on when the water temps drop. up there they are normally up before the ones in lake o.. i usually start fishing the pine later this month.
490735,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-03 02:22:00,602,"I fish the Notty every fall, and it's usually the middle of September they start to run, then a few weeks later the rainbow start to come up. Depending on the amount of rain and temperature."
490742,Musky or Specks,2010-08-03 02:53:00,2710,The salmon will be starting in china straight any time now and the bows start @ labour day weekend
490779,12footspringbok,2010-08-03 10:48:00,459,There probably already a few in there right now with all the rain we've been having this summer. However theres been so few salmon in the notty the past few years that i won't bother until about the last week of August.
490782,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-03 11:11:00,602,"Last year was brutal for rainbow in the notty, not sure if there was too much rain or what, I know there was a big damn north of angus. The previous year I fished half the time and caught twice as many rainbow."
490784,Fisherman,2010-08-03 11:37:00,7201," Long before you ever held a fishing rod, we had salmon in the Notty as early as mid June with the probable ""average"" year starting about the 2nd week of August with multiple runs coming every week until the end of September, then the rainbow runs would start."
490870,misfish,2010-08-03 16:55:00,29133, Dont forget about the Skamianias (sp?) aswell. What a rush.
490875,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-03 17:00:00,0,  the rain we had the first week in july this year........
490896,Fisherman,2010-08-03 17:40:00,7201,"Screaming lines, smokin' reels and rods bent like a big C.  Long gone are those years, unfortunately and probably never to return."
490951,bill smy,2010-08-03 20:09:00,31,I certainly agree i was told by another fisherman that natives were gill netting hundreds of trout.
490958,misfish,2010-08-03 20:21:00,29133," LOL My very first one,it was up the river, round the bend,back down back up, about 20 times."
490962,solopaddler,2010-08-03 20:35:00,8605, That's why I love the sport. I've been hardcore since about 1977. Right now is the golden age for the sport in the great lakes region.
490971,Musky or Specks,2010-08-03 20:50:00,2710,I don't know about that lots of epic fall days(50 fish on) on the LargeSkull in the mid eighties. Don't hear about to many of those on ontario rivers anymore.
490976,solopaddler,2010-08-03 20:56:00,8605," Georgian Bay trib's still have their moment in the sun, albeit the numbers aren't what they used to be.  As someone who fishes for steelhead in every province and state that borders all the lakes, I can safely say the sport, the fishery, and the opportunities for anglers have never been better."
490992,misfish,2010-08-03 21:23:00,29133," You SIR,from the reports you post,know what you are talking about. IMO.  I myself, really enjoyed fishing the tribs back in the earlly 80,s.Lots of fish. I just got away from it."
491104,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-04 01:48:00,602,"Man, wish I was fishing in the 80's... well I was, but I was 4, when sunfish were fun"
491112,BillM,2010-08-04 01:57:00,17367," Last year was a banner year for steelhead in the Notty, where were you fishing?  lol"
491123,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-04 02:17:00,602,"Angus, no one was catching hardly any"
491128,wallacio,2010-08-04 02:28:00,475," Angus is one of the most heavily pressured spots on the river and as a result, fishing goes stale there quickly.  There are a multitude of other places to go that almost always hold Steelhead - they're just a bit harder to get to.   Fished moved upstream quickly last season with all of the water so lower sections tended to be a tough go.  Trust me when I say last year was a good one...just gotta know where to look!   Here's just a small sample:          "
491133,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-04 02:34:00,602,"looks like you caught alot as the ice was setting in, I will be trying different areas this coming fall. I figured last year with all the rain they went right through, guess I was right. Nice fish"
491508,bill smy,2010-08-05 03:57:00,31,"I fish close to alliston, i caught a few but not the normal. Some of my favourite spots went private property. The notty is not my favourite river because all the how murky, slow and loggy it is."
491541,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-05 11:19:00,602,Might have to pay off a farmer to get access to somewhere remote on the river. Then keep it quiet
491548,BillM,2010-08-05 11:53:00,17367," The Notty always has a tinge to it, and the logs are another thing you need to deal with..  I'm glad I'm only 15mins away from the river, definitely one of my favs and most frustrating I might add..  Alot of fish made it up way past Alliston early in the season last year, which is great for the fishery."
491571,wallacio,2010-08-05 13:32:00,475,"Unfortunately posted land is becoming the norm on the middle Notty (between Angus and Alliston).  I figured that with the recent change to the no-kill regs for that section, traffic would lessen and landowners would be less militant but it actually seems to have gone the other way.   With that said, there are numerous good places to fish where public access isn't an issue.  The slow, log-infested water definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea and I know many decent Steelheaders that have tried it a few times only to delare ""there aren't any fish in the Notty!""   I'm happy to let them go on believing this!"
