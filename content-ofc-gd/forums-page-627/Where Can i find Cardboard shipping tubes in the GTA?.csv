507281,BucktownAngler,2010-09-27 16:12:00,582,I'd like to purchase a cardboard tube for an upcoming roadtrip. I dont want my rods to be damaged. I'll need one for my 7ft 1-piece rod. Does anybody know where i can find one to purchase?  Is it a bad idea to put more then 1 rod in a tube?  Can anybody recommend a good rod case to buy for my other 2-piece rods? ( That will fit 3 rods)  Thanks

507283,Spiel,2010-09-27 16:18:00,9065,"Yep, find a local carpet retailer and you'll likely find a heavy duty tube at no cost. Cut to length and cap, I've found that the plastic lids from peanut butter jars will often fit beautifully."

507357,bare foot wader,2010-09-27 19:03:00,1354,"I've picked them up at a carpet and paper supply stores, free of charge  few words of advice:  -you'll be fine on a roadtrip but do not trust UPS/Canada post with your rods in carboard, pay extra to insure full value of your rods or go heavier with pvc piping  -if you're transporting more than one rod buy soft cloth rod sleeves or get the cheap plastic ones...your rods will vibrate and rub against each other during transport, very least will scratch and scruff up the blank...if it's bad enough i've had rods snap at exactly those spots  -pack teh ends of the tube with a sock or bubble wrap...if you brake hard while driving you won't snap a tip off...or if some canada post ass is living out babe ruth dreams with your rod tube...."

507393,Duckie,2010-09-27 20:47:00,305,I have made many road trips with my one peice rods without any sort of tube.  I just pack the car and put the rods on top of everything else. they can't get crushed or damaged if they are on top.  so far so good (touches wood) LOL
