507917,Roy,2010-09-29 15:04:00,13728,HMMM.. I've never seen MNR folks electro-shocking muskies. I guess it must be doable. But muskies detect changes in electrical fields and move out of range before the voltage is great enough to make them roll over...unlike most other species. I guess if they were ambushed....  You obviously missed my point about holding your breath. People lose sight of time in the heat of the action....holding ones breath was just suggested as a way of getting a better idea how long a fish is out of water.
507919,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-29 15:12:00,0,  Not to mention...there's a huge difference between a St Clair Muskie release box and a Mr.Pike livewell.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb7WMjIXtKU
507920,Headhunter,2010-09-29 15:12:00,5703,"OMG... I can't believe how some of you guys make it through the day. A musky is a fish, nothing more, nothing less. Some folks have made helpful suggestions; others act like the OP came close to killing their first born!

507992,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-29 22:21:00,0," No, I need a better net! The problem is sometimes the fish goes crazy and the lure and the fish get all tangled in the net! Have yet to lose a fish(knock on wood).  But as I explained, as the Muskys get bigger, their survival chance decreases, so they should be back in the water ASAP."
508002,Musky or Specks,2010-09-29 23:05:00,2710,Roy Ive both electrofished( Do-able in a river situation) them and fyke netted them and then collected measurements and samples. Also angled and tagged them. Witness surgery for radio telemetry. In all situations fish are handled as little as possible and often given a break in holding pens before next measurement is done.
508039,Cast-Away,2010-09-30 00:57:00,790,Moemoe Cograts to a great fish and let go alive! Enough said to that.  When I see some of the replies it reminds me of why I don't post very much here. Some people just have too much to say on this board all of the time.  I'm sure that this will be locked down soon enough.
508073,Tdel,2010-09-30 01:42:00,393,"I think a lot of you are missing the main point or you are just ignoring it. > A 53"" muskie is an illegal fish on Georgian Bay and and must be released immediately. It is as simple as that.  I can almost guarantee you that if you put a 53"" muskie in your livewell and were transporting it to take a picture, then got stopped by the game warden and OPP on Georgian Bay near Severn Sound, you would be charged, no if and or buts.  It doesn't matter how the fish was handled. It is an illegal fish .... bottom line and should not be in the livewell. This post is not meant to bash or rag on MoeMoe who caught a pair of very nice fish and should be proud.  It is stating facts.    Tom"
508077,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-30 01:50:00,0, Thats OK . ..You know it. Moe knows it and I know it as do the ones who understand what is important. The others....well ..ya cant please them all eh.  I've said it before. Some things just go all out of wack when there's a lack of understanding in a situation. No issues. Some will learn a thing or two and some will learn the hard way.

507757,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-28 21:12:00,0,"First I'd like to say WOW! Those are the type of muskys every musky fisherman on this site aspires too. AND you caught 2 in a week AND on a spinner bait of which most musky fanatics will tell you that they dont catch big musky!  I'm pretty sure that musky was way too large for your livewell, but as you said? The dock was 30 SECONDS away. There are not too many fishermen on this board that wouldn't have done the same. Myself included.  Sometimes I have the musky out of the water for 5 minutes trying to get the hook out and then photograph it. They take awhile to revive but I have yet to lose a fish.(I think I just jinxed myself). Still a fish that big is very fragile and every minute counts. It would be a big waste to lose a big girl like that. So a 5 minute boat ride(Plus photos) would have been too much.  But yes. If the CO would have caught you? They could have slapped you with a sever fine if they chose to do so. Since for all he knew? You could have been keeping an illegal fish to mount or eat.  Anyways thanks for posting those beautiful fish. I'm sure you made alot more friends then enemies on this board since most people would love to fish with you now.lol  Lesson of the day? Dont go Musky fishing in trophy waters without a camera."

507827,Roy,2010-09-29 00:57:00,13728,"Five minutes is a death sentence. She might swim away after a while but she'll be found belly up on someone's beach a few hours later. I don't want to sound like a nag here but once you bring the fish to the boat, leave it in the pen net. Remove the hooks while the fish is in the net and in the water. If you need a pic of the fish, make sure the camera(s) is ready and then commit to taking it out for the pic. Don't pussyfoot around, grab the fish properly. As you pull the fish out of the water, hold your breath....when you can no longer hold your breath, that fish needs to go back in. Once in the water, hold it by the tail with your other hand under the belly to keep it upright. Don't move it back and forth, just hold it there. You'll feel the strength return to the fish and they should swim off strongly.  Just sayin'."
507837,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-29 01:16:00,0,  Good job Terry....
507846,Joey,2010-09-29 01:44:00,9122," HAHAHA, no, actually I thought that was part of the background, good job man!"
507850,GBW,2010-09-29 01:52:00,8460,"Yes, both are great fish.  Now can we let this one go? I mean the OP replied to my PM and told me it was caught on a ""Spiderman rod with a worm on a hook under a bobber while fishing for panfish"" let's let it go..."
507853,cram,2010-09-29 02:12:00,1733, This is great advice.
507859,John Bacon,2010-09-29 03:54:00,3277," I can understand not wanting to keep the fish out of water to for too long; but is there any scientific basis for keeping it out of the water for the amount of time that you can hold your breath?  A sperm whale can hold its breath for two hours, a salt water crocodile can hold its breath for three hours.  Is there any reason to beleive that a muskie's who has just fought a hard battle can survice out of water for the same length of time as the person who caught it can hold their breath?  I am sure that the less time they spend out of water the better.  Holding your breath while you hold them out of the water may encourage you to put them back sooner; if so that is beneficial.  However, as for there being any actual correlation between a muskie's ability to survice out of water and a persons ability to hold their breath; I find this very doubtful.  Who knows, that may be too long for a muskie to be out of water after a long battle."
507860,cram,2010-09-29 04:09:00,1733," i think its a concept....while you hold it out of water, its essentially unable to breathe.  And as you pointed out, that's after a big battle.  The point is...when you run out of breath after 45 seconds, and you put hte fish back, it's better than holding it out for 3-5 (or 10) minutes."
507861,Roy,2010-09-29 04:20:00,13728,"Oh geez no, no correlation at all...just an idea that I think might have some merit. Do what you like. I just thought I'd pass that along."
507881,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-29 12:09:00,0,"  Scientific fact? It is a known fact that 'large' fish do not do well being out of the water for longer than a brief moment which comes from experience, reading and learning the hard way. It was meant as a helpful idea and a good one for people who do not target these fish. After you catch a 50...see how long you can hold your breath and the fish out of the water at the same time. I bet it won't be longer than 15 or 20 seconds before yer hanging over the side of the boat gasping...  and reviving the fish of course. It only takes 5 seconds to take a picture."
507883,markiemark70,2010-09-29 12:34:00,158," No offence dude, but since we are all being so helpful and giving out great suggestions, here's one for you: you may want to change your profile pic before giving out advice on proper fish handling. Just sayin."

507906,canadadude,2010-09-29 14:02:00,769,"Hey guys you ever watch the MNR tag a fish,they first electroshock it , then measure it, then weigh it, then take a scale sample, then tag it after all this the fish is revived then released.Trust me if you could hold your breath through all that you'd be passed out.Also reviving fish in a live well before release is a great way to get the fish going again,it's actually being practiced on Lake St Clair Muskie with great success, as for the MNR giving you a hard time a CO would be sympathatic to you if you released the fish and I doubt any charges would laid."

507437,Dutch,2010-09-27 22:12:00,831,"Those are some great fish - wtg!  Not many people catch one of those in a lifetime let alone 2 within a couple of weeks, for that you need to be commended.  I almost cringe everytime I see a title with someone posting pictures of a big 'ski becuase I know what the backlash will be.  It is really unfortunately that people on this site seem to bash it, but I guess that is the world that is the internet.  If the OP had just posted the picture at the dock it probably would have been worse as there would have been accusations that he kept it or purposefully travleed a long way to get back and snap a quick pic.  What's worse for the OP?  Admitting to travelling with the fish or an unqualified post with just the pic at the dock.  He chose to explain himself and still got jabbed for it.  In the end all he wanted to do was show this COMMUNITY a fish or two that are trophies and that some of us will never get a chance to see up close.  Thanks for that.  We've got a bunch of arm chair CO's out here and it doesn't do anything for the confidence of new or existing members for posting reports.  I know there are people out here that no longer post reports due to the potential backlash.  It is one thing to use the regs or the size of livewells to back-up opinions, sure go ahead, but the regs don't account for common sense in wanting to take a picture of a trophy fish when you've forgot the camera.  There's no doubt in my mind that the OP had the health of that fish in mind when taking it for a pic, I think most others would agree since the tone of this thread is more about the regulatory aspect of 53 vs. 54 than the health of the fish.  Give it a rest for a bit and be supportive - we are a COMMUNITY after all."
507438,glen,2010-09-27 22:14:00,2641,"moemoe Great fish.  No it is not the same as an OOS fish.  Muskie are in season.  Your fish are under the size limit.  A legal fish is 54"".  You are allowed to take a quick picture of a fish under 54"" it then must be put back into the water.  No boat ride.  No livewell."

You said:  ""what gets me is all the guys that are bashing the people trying to protect muskie and let you know it is against the law...""  That is not the intent of the following posts:    Two better posts on the topic that do say it is illegal, which are appropriate and informative.

507222,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-27 13:11:00,0,  Stuffing a fish that won't fit in a live well is just as bad if you ask me. Most here don't know it but I know MoeMoe's boat as it was I who advertized it for sale here at OFC and He bought it from a friend of mine. If you all feel it's OK to stuff a slot sized fish in a live well for pictures or taxidermy purposes which only requires length and grith measurements..  ..I wouldnt feel to bad when you come here and complain about losing your boat and equipemnt after you have been pulled over by the MNR and OPP...and by the looks of things. There are a few as normal who feel they are above doing it the right way. Moe knows he did it wrong and Moe...making an excuse for taxidermny purposes...  It be a shame to see you lose that boat of yours. Hows that civil for ya.....
507235,Gregoire,2010-09-27 13:57:00,1397,"gbfisher, being fairlyu new to this sight and to musky fishing I have been doing a lot of reading on proper release tactics and what is legal. Although not advisable, I was under the impression that keeping a musky in a livewell is acceptable as long as you are planning on releasing the fish. Otherwise all fish besides those that can be kept legally would have to be released in the water. I may be mistaken on this. Moe I am happy that the beast was released succefully. gbfisher, do you work for the MNR? If so I would appreciate you clearing this issue up with me."
507240,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-27 14:08:00,0," The answer to our question is simply...No, it was not legal and would have had him losing everything that got him there that day if he was pulled over. The regulation need to be read before making comments about things you do not understand."

Do I need to head out on the bay to get into musky? or are they hiding in any of the channels? Like south channel or something... Send me a PM if you want to fish sometime, I'm sure you could teach me tons about the area, just started fishing it a year or so ago."

507288,BillM,2010-09-27 16:39:00,17367," You're right, all those black boots swimming up the Notty this year must have been catfish.  Thanks again for the eye opening insight.  :facepalm:"
507303,jbailey,2010-09-27 17:19:00,866,"just gorgeous fish pal! congrats, but you're probably addicted now.. haha"
507307,Fisherpete,2010-09-27 17:22:00,1814,Those are the kind of muskies that I aspire to... and you go out and get two of them within a few days!!! Simply outstanding!!!
507312,Gregoire,2010-09-27 17:29:00,1397," I find your response a tad insulting. I have read contradictory info about this topic. I was asking for clarification. I have read the regulations and they seem somewhat open to interpretation. Although certain species are identified as allowed as being kept in a livewell, there does not seem to be any species that are prohibited. The use of the word generally, and the fact that more than the daily limitmay be ketp makes this issue confusing. What about if you are no longer fishing and using the livewell to revive your fish? I guess I am just wondering what makes you so certain about your interpretation of the regulations. With the ambiguous nature of the regualtions, especially regarding the language, why would you assume that I have not read the regulations? Why not assume that I do not understand them, and attempt to correct me without insulting me?"
507334,Terry,2010-09-27 18:14:00,14456," what non legal fish are allowed to be kept in a livewell, I would really be interested it knowing that"
507355,moemoe,2010-09-27 18:54:00,352,"It wasn't kept in a live well, it was just relocated a couple hundred yards   , thanks for all the well wishers, gbfisher, I love the boat, and it didn't seem inhumane, it's a fairly big livewell, but I understand your point and others, but that being said, I have an awesome pic to remember it buy, and it still swam, away, one fish was caugt in the evening and the other mid afternoon, The only big tip I would have as soon as the lure hit the water, I would pull 1 ft and then let the lure flutter for a second and both hits were right on the flutter, In september on Gbay, I have some decent pike in the same depth of water"
507358,Raf,2010-09-27 19:03:00,3495,"congrats on the catches, nice done.  to gbfisher's point; the minimum size on gbay is 54"", hence having it in your livewell (thus in your possession) would have been illegal."
507367,ehg,2010-09-27 19:36:00,2666,Those are real nice fish and to catch these bruisers in such close time makes it more remarkable.  Most folks are just helping by making you aware of some things in the future.
507378,TC1OZ,2010-09-27 20:16:00,987,"Just face it... You guys are all jealous you can't fit a 50"" musky in your live wells.... let alone catch a 50""'er.  "
507395,limeyangler,2010-09-27 20:55:00,5204,Absolutely great fishes!  Top marks!
507399,Terry,2010-09-27 21:02:00,14456, but you understand that most people go nuts here when anyone takes a photo of an OOS bass  that muskie was not a legal fish and he would have lost his boat and equipment if the MNR caught him  why is this OK have I missed something as compared to the OOS outrage
507413,F7Firecat,2010-09-27 21:26:00,347,"Very nice FEESH!!  Congrats on those fish, they are sweet!!!!!! Thanks for letting them go!"
507416,TC1OZ,2010-09-27 21:31:00,987," I have no OOS outrage, take a pic and put it back! I don't care what the season is.....  People who rage on people for OOS pictures are hypocrites, if you really cared about the fish why are you trying to catch them on a hook or even capture them for that matter. let alone catch and release...  If you really wanted them to flourish you wouldn't be out there catching them, you'd be telling people to stop fishing in general.  Obviously there's a huge difference if people are fishing and keeping out of season fish (who posts that on the internet), but come on now he just wanted a picture of a fish that 98% of people will never get in their life.  People get off your freaking high horses..... and lecture the people who aren't aware you need a fishing license to participate in the act of fishing.  Or if you really really really are on that horse, send the man a PM!"
507122,moemoe,2010-09-27 00:44:00,352,"I am by now means a  professional musky fisher, so be kind but I managed to get out on Georgian bay are for some late fall fishing, tough conditions weather wise but managed a couple of slobs, 1st fish was 53inches, and 41bs, I did forget the camera in another boat, so the fish did make a short 30 second ride to the dock in my live well, hence the shot on the dock, Was released after a short rest beside the dock, Caught this beauty in approx 4 fow in a weedy bay and Lindy m/g spinner,  Second fish beneath here was caught on the same spinner in 3 fow off a point with some shallow weeds,"
507123,moemoe,2010-09-27 00:46:00,352,"Heres the second caught a couple days later, both were released and swam away strongly "
507124,danbouck,2010-09-27 00:46:00,4380,Awesome ski!
507125,moemoe,2010-09-27 00:49:00,352,another pic of the first

507130,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-27 00:52:00,932,Very Very Nice Fish.  I hope they were returned in good shape - they are truly trophies.  Well done and thanks for sharing.
507134,Jigger,2010-09-27 00:56:00,1237,"For water that doesn't give up those kinds of fish easily, I'd say that you had an incredible weekend! Beauty 'skis man!"
507136,Nipfisher,2010-09-27 00:59:00,2449,Beauty skis MoeMoe. Are these fish in the shallows in the mid afternoon or morning? Nice shot of the magic lure. Where do you hook on the marshmallows?
507138,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-27 01:01:00,0,Nice fish Moe Moe...I know you were excited but LIVE WELL??? With a slot fish to boot.  Pushing that type of release isn't going to give you any brownie points.   on a side note..nice to see the airship is being put to good use...
507146,Pigeontroller,2010-09-27 01:31:00,2793,Two very nice fish...Late Fall? Were these caught last year?
507151,ctdd2006,2010-09-27 01:37:00,531, I knew that would come up....not sure I'd have done differently though....  Tough spot...glad they swam strong.  Awesome fish and CONGRATS!!!  Has your heart slowed yet????
507153,Joey,2010-09-27 01:40:00,9122,"Very nice fish Moemoe, well done.  Joey"
507155,moemoe,2010-09-27 01:54:00,352,"I know it was pushing it, and I couldn't believe I forgot the camera, I usually fish Salmon on lake O, so to me, this is late fall I guess, and yes my whole body was shaking with exicetment"
507160,Musky or Specks,2010-09-27 01:57:00,2710,I'm so jealous I will never post in any of your threads
507163,TerryC,2010-09-27 02:01:00,196,Those are two serious ski's. WTG  Clarence
507167,moemoe,2010-09-27 02:15:00,352,"I want to get a replica of the first, so hence getting a photo for reference was important to me,"
507180,BillM,2010-09-27 03:06:00,17367,"I would have gotten a photo to, screw what anyone thinks...  At least you didn't drag the damn thing behind the boat on a stringer..."
507188,landry,2010-09-27 03:29:00,1005,"Wow. Awesome job!!!!! Beauty fish! I find it annoying that the Musky Release Police always have to chime in some insulting release technique comment. Sometimes it is warranted but c'mon!  (And yes, I use effective in the water release techniques and horizontal holds - so I don't need a lecture too)"
507189,scuro2,2010-09-27 03:35:00,904,Big...big fish.
507191,kerr,2010-09-27 03:38:00,77,"good job on the skis bud, hey bill where did u hear about a stringer being used like that, there was an incident this year that i heard of on a lake x where a 50+ was killed because of overhandling /stringer? just curious if you and i r speaking of the same incident."
507194,BillM,2010-09-27 03:54:00,17367," Most likely not, I was just using an example of a bad way to bring the fish back to the dock for a picture  I can't believe anyone would string up a 50incher, it's almost laughable."
507198,MCTFisher9120,2010-09-27 10:35:00,3761,"Amazing catches man, really good to see big gbay musky!"
