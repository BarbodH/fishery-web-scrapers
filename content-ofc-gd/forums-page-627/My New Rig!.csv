507586,denisk,2010-09-28 10:06:00,163,Hopefully it wasn't a 620 or 621VS.
507598,corvette1,2010-09-28 12:05:00,1765,sweet ride congrats
507612,bigbuck,2010-09-28 13:25:00,2449,Very nice rig!!! Now go get it all slimy and smelly!!
507667,linweir,2010-09-28 15:20:00,202,"Great rig!! How you compare it with Lund Tyee 1950 or Baron? I guess it's more likely a tournamnet-related boat, and Tyuee or Baron is more likely Salmon and mult-species boat (deeper and wider), right? They are all for great water."
507688,Stoty,2010-09-28 16:12:00,2910," To be honest...I have no idea as this is my first Lund (and first non-bass boat). Yes, the boat is a tournament series boat.  I was out on Quinte last Thursday, in 5 footers, and it handled them with ease!"
507736,esoxansteel,2010-09-28 19:46:00,1307,"  Better still go a little further east and slime her up with some real fish, that eat 8lb walleyes for snacks"
507747,Stoty,2010-09-28 20:22:00,2910, Is that an offer to take me out?! lol  Are there fish that will eat 13.6 lber's too? Cause we landed one of those today!  
507385,Stoty,2010-09-27 20:34:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  Since this year has been pretty bad so far...I thought I would share something GOOD that happened! lol  I sold my 2006 Ranger, and picked up:  2006 Lund Pro-V (2025) Mangnum IFS 225 HP Mercury Optimax 9.9 HP Mercury Pro Kicker 101 lbs thrust, Minn Kota Terrova with auto-pilot   I opted for a deeper boat, as I have been slowly migrating from Bass fishing, into Walleye fishing/guiding.  I have since got the boat wrapped in our company's brand (G2 Angling).  Enjoy, I know I sure am!          "
507387,TC1OZ,2010-09-27 20:37:00,987,I'm totally jellin!
507389,perchslayer666,2010-09-27 20:43:00,280,"Killer rig man, perfect for those Quinte Eyes. Deep V's are waaaayy more versitile than Bass boats. She'll handle nice out there."
507390,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-27 20:45:00,2690,"Sweet boat, Jamie!  Enjoy!"
507402,Terry,2010-09-27 21:06:00,14456,dang that is pretty much what I want in my next boat..2.5 years away    I really want a merc verado on it ..but I would take that one too
507403,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-27 21:07:00,28,Very nice rig.
507404,archie_james_c,2010-09-27 21:12:00,618,Imagine all the fishin' a guy could do with a boat like that
507407,danbouck,2010-09-27 21:19:00,4380,what no interior shots?
507411,HTHM,2010-09-27 21:25:00,4082,sniff.....it's not a Ranger. Nice looking rig!
507412,bassman,2010-09-27 21:26:00,384,Schwiiiiing!!!
507419,Pigeontroller,2010-09-27 21:47:00,2793,Nice cover!
507425,Stoty,2010-09-27 21:54:00,2910,"Thanks everyone!  If you see me out on the Bay of Quinte, be sure to come say hi!"
507426,steverowbotham,2010-09-27 21:56:00,1800,nice! congrats

507433,Roy,2010-09-27 22:02:00,13728,"Great boat...I'd wrap the truck too though, otherwise, people will think that your pullin' someone elses' boat."
507435,fish_fishburn,2010-09-27 22:08:00,1311,"Hey Stoty don't you like the Ranger walleye boat? They look pretty sweet. Just kidding man, nice ride. I like the cover too."
507441,Dutch,2010-09-27 22:17:00,831,Nice ride.

507482,daryl0815,2010-09-27 23:51:00,225,"Sweet rig man, definitely a little more versatile than a bass boat!"
507484,Stoty,2010-09-27 23:55:00,2910, It's being done next week!!
507496,Gman,2010-09-28 00:12:00,126,"Right on, congratulations!  Who's doin' the wraps for ya, Currie?  Just curious as I work in the industry for 3M's largest distributor of commercial & industrial graphic films. We work very closely with 3M and put on numerous training courses throughout the season.  Cheers G."
