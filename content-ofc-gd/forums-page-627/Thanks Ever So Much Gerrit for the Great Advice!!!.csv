507359,Leecher,2010-09-27 19:10:00,7832,"Back in May, had some water leaking in the basement due to a clog rain gutter..... got that unclogged but at the same time found out that the roof had a an indent at one end  Posted a report about it on here.... here's the link  Surprise  and got some good advice about fixing it and doing it right by Gerrit  A couple of weeks ago undertook the task of repairing the kitchen roof because it had rotten wood underneath and the shingles were at their last breath..... suffice to say that once all the shingles was stripped off, we could actually see the damage that the rain gutter down spout did.  Did not take any pics of it but a friend of my brother came to inspect and gave me a quote on the repair cost and material needed.  The quote was $150.00 for labor and roughly $160.00 for material.  Well he was bang on!!! and now it's a done deal   Took a few pics after it was all done    Applying cocking on the nails and along the gutter's edge      and today got the finishing touch done    Rotten wood ain't happening no more at that end Thanks ever so much again Gerrit for the great advice Leechman  Oppps.... I forgot to add this pic of my next project.... re-doing all of my garden fence posts.... started with the tomatoes...  "

507724,Leecher,2010-09-28 19:08:00,7832, Beans it really sucks when this happens   hope it's not too serious and that you were able to rectify the leak
507749,Beans,2010-09-28 20:37:00,3339, It didn't rain very hard this morning and it is sunny outside right now...I'm wondering if the water found a new route and is running down below in the crawlspace...I'll have to check down there next...I know I need a new roof but was hoping it would hold up until next spring when hopefully finances are better...   
507795,cynmar,2010-09-28 23:42:00,169,"The gut wrenching feeling never ends. Got a new roof done in 2007. New 1/2 "" sheeting all over, ice & water shield over all of low slope. Metal gutters and 30 year asphalt shingles. Roof had never leaked before. Following spring water damage in the office , whole ceiling ripped out and repaired but insurance wouldn't cover shoddy workmanship on roof. Spent another thousand for repair to couple of areas. Next spring water damage in office again but not as bad. I go up on roof and find no step flashing along siding but as was in March just roof patched the crap along the siding. Now another roofer wants another $2300 to repair as he believes roof gutter not coming down far enough. All told close to 13K so far. Ohhhh the pain.  Bill"
507800,Leecher,2010-09-28 23:51:00,7832," I hear you on the finance.... were looking to get the main roof done next year also   WOW Bill.... when it rains it pours   christ all mighty, hope you finally get to have some waterless springs with the new contractor  Good luck with it!!!"
