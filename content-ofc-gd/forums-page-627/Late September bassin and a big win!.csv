I had Kwan and his mother out last week on Couchiching and the bite was pretty tough, fish were shy but we coaxed a bunch into biting and lost a bunch to boot.  Not a bad day overall and they had a few smaller one for the steamer.      Sunday we had our clubs final tournament of the year and I got drawn to fish with my dad.  Good choice of lake for it too.  We were on beautiful Lake Simcoe, and a couple of my fall spots have been hot. With the calm weather we made a long run to a favourite spot and dropped the electric.  As I was making my first cast, dad says FISH ON! A modest 3.5 pounder and a good way to start. We landed at least 15 more in the next hour.  Crazy pace and good fish! Around 8:30am the wind switched East and the bite died. Ran to a new area and hooked a 5 pounder on my 3rd cast.  A passing boat slowed down, watched and took off.  We continued fishing the area, sticking the odd one here and there, when all of a sudden the same boat comes flying towards us and stops about 200 feet away and starts fishing his way towards us. Come on!  I know I dont own the water, but have some respect.  It's just etiquette.  Anywhoo, we had a great day out there and weighed in at 37.00lbs for 8 fish.  In our club, each angler keeps their biggest 4.  Individual weights go to Angler of the Year scoring and total team weight takes the cash prize.  I weighed 19.65 and dad had 17.35lbs  With the win I clinched the Angler of the Year title for the Barrie Bassmasters.  Club Classic will be in 2 weeks on Lake of Bays... hopefully I can get some revenge on those acrobati smallies that killed me this summer.   Dad's 17.35lbs 4 fish bag   my 19.65lbs 4 fish bag    Today I had the task of finding some more piggies for an old co-worker.  Tricky start but I found them in a different area and we were able to land about a dozen.  Pretty tough bite overall though.        So long for now, good fishin."

507678,tb4me,2010-09-28 15:53:00,3295,Wow awesome! Good for you and your dad! Lake of bays will be fun.. Lots of 5 lb smallies to be had in there thats for sure. Good luck and will look for the report after. Thanks for sharing
507788,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-28 23:24:00,0,Congrats on the win!Well deserved! Just curious. 200 feet away doesn't sound that close. What would you consider an appropriate distance to fish from another boat?  You would hate shore fishing. This summer I've had entire families see me catch fish and surround me(shoulder to shoulder) on a small stretch of shoreline.lol

507866,solopaddler,2010-09-29 09:32:00,8605,"Congrat's Steve, a well deserved win."
507978,steverowbotham,2010-09-29 20:50:00,1800," You're right, 200 feet is an acceptable distance.  But as I wrote, he stopped the engine about 200 feet away and started fishing his way TOWARDS us, almost within casting distance and its a big area.  We used the electric to work around the area and they would follow.  Its just the situation thats frustrating.  They had zero intention on fishing that area but saw us catch a fish and proceeded to then try and crowd us off the spot.  It's not against any rule, its just rude.  That being said, thanks everyone for the positive comments."
