I know that George Lake is closed for lake trout fishing, and the general trout season (except for rainbow) will be closed by Oct 1.  Are there other fish species in that lake, like bass or walleye or pike?  If not in George Lake, any nearby lakes that might have fishing opportunities?  We'll be paddling in canoes.  We might also drop by French River Provincial Park on our way home on Sunday.  Is it worth a visit?  Appreciate any info in that area since this is my first time going up there.  Thanks."

Some of the other lakes in the area have other species, there is a handout at the store at the entrance which detail what is where and which lakes are closed to fishing. French River PP I haven't been to, can't help there."
