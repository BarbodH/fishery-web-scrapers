507192,scuro2,2010-09-27 03:39:00,904,Been fishing a not so big lake that is dammed on the outflow. I had bows all dialed in at the end of August but today I went out and nada. So how to bows transition from late summer into the fall?
507200,alexmedic,2010-09-27 10:57:00,186,Ran into the same situation a while ago in a little stocked bow lake.  Normally rigging off the bottom worked.  All of a sudden flatlining was the trick.  Maybe the lake turned over??
