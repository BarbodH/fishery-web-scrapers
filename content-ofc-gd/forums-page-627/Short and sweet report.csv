506915,danbouck,2010-09-26 01:36:00,4380,"My wife and I headed out to get some perch today. The wind was crazy, the waved were STUPID but it was a day without the kids so I was going to make it happen.  We ended up going closer to shore than I would have like but we couldn't anchor where I wanted to. But we managed to get a decent amount of fish. We fished for 4 hours and caught over 100 perch and kept 33.  This one was a wee bit sore!      The wind and waved did get a little better but it looked like something was brewing            "
