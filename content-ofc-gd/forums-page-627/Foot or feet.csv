507494,aplumma,2010-09-28 00:10:00,6896,What you all dont know is their are only a few of the U.S. citizens who know how to speak correctly. We call them Cajuns or Coonasses but if we dig hard enough into the history books we will find they are Arcadian.   Art
507500,mercman,2010-09-28 00:20:00,7054," up here we call them acadians. a mixture on english and french.Most live in New brunswick.I think your cajuns are like out Metis, a mixture of fench and native indian. They have a dialect all thier own."
507722,aplumma,2010-09-28 19:01:00,6896,  Yes we do My last name is Melancon and my mothers maiden name is Toupes.The Arcadian's went down the coast till they settled into the Bayous of Louisiana were the Indians and the escaped slaves showed us how to live with the land. The pigeon French is still a strong language that is mixed with lots of slang from other cultures making it hard to follow if you have not heard it regularly. I think even Roy would be pressed hard to understand all of the words they have invented.   Art

507142,Daplumma,2010-09-27 01:10:00,1961,"Sometimes we talk funny down here.The way it goes is two feet of water,three foot of water.Dunno why,its the way it is.Not wrong,just different.    A Cajun man wants a job, but the foreman won't hire him until he passes a little math test. Here is your first question, the foreman said. ""Without using numbers, represent the number 9."" ""Without numbers?"" The Cajun says, ""Dat is easy."" And proceeds to draw three trees.      "" What's this?"" the boss asks? ""Ave you got no brain? Tree and tree and tree make nine,"" says the Cajun. ! ""Fair enough,"" says the boss. ""Here's your second question. Use the same rules, but this time the number is 99."" The Cajun stares into space for a while, then picks up the picture that he has just drawn and makes a smudge on each tree. ""Ere you go.""      The boss scratches his head and says, ""How on earth do you get that to represent 99?""  ""Each of da trees is dirty now. So, it's dirty tree, and dirty tree, and dirty tree. Dat is 99.""  Surely Microsoft can find a place for him!!!!! The boss is getting worried that he's going to actually have to hire this Cajun, so he says, ""All right, last question. Same rules again, but represent the number 100."" The Cajun stares into space some more, then he picks up the picture again and makes a little mark at the base of each tree and says, ""Ere you go. One hundred.""      The boss looks at the attempt. ""You must be nuts if you think that represents a hundred!"" The Cajun leans forward and points to the marks at the base of each tree and says, ""A little dog come along and crap by each tree. So now you got dirty tree and a turd, dirty tree and a turd, and dirty tree and a turd, which makes one hundred."" ""So, when I start?""  "
