We will be hitting Sturgeon in the Kawarthas.  Iâ€™ve never fished a lake this late in the year.  Where would the majority of the fish be staging?  I know they well be feeding well to fatten up for summer but where typically this time of year?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Hopefully I will have some pics to post after this weekend!  Thanks."

Earlier in the season, you would find lots of smallmouth (nothing huge) around the islands or near the bays around the weeds. But bass fishing has probably slowed down at this time of the year. Also try around the islands for muskie if you're interested in that. I didn't have much luck in catching largemouth in Sturgeon Lake; you really have to into Goose Bay to catch them (I think). Walleye was also sporadic for me. But then like I said, it could be just me! Let us know how you make out. Catching no fish is still better than not fishing at all!  "

507707,super dave,2010-09-28 17:22:00,323,Any bait/lure favourites?  Thanks for the responses so far.

We were fishing in 4 - 10 FOW.  Seems like the little muskies couldn't stop raiding everyones baits!"
