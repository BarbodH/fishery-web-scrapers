Now I found the specs on my unit , the attached Motor Guide diagarm shows 50 amp breaker used ( i have attached link to specs for you to check out- file to big to upload)...My questions are as follows:  1. 40amp (suggested by masses) or 50 amp (specs) for 12v 36 lb thrust - wire run is about 23 feet  http://www.nuggetfishing.com.au/index.php?option=com_vfm&Itemid=412&do=view&file=Electric+Motors|Motorguide|F36.pdf  2. How the hell do you guys have enough room to install breaker inside battery box ( i have a 27 class Seasence Box) and make it all fit when closing lide and straping it down?...  My boat is really tight for space and want to keep breader dry and best place for this is in box!!  IF you have pics that would be much appreciated!!!!   Help"
