His wife Marsha had long ago given up trying to get  him to change..  One day John came home with  another one of his unusual purchases. It was a robot that John  claimed was actually a lie  detector. It  was about 5:30 that afternoon when Tommy, their 11 year old  son, returned home from school. Tommy was over 2 hours  late.  ""Where have you been? Why are you over 2  hours late getting home?"" asked John.  ""Several of  us went to the library to work on an extra credit project,""  said Tommy.  The robot walked around the table and  slapped Tommy, knocking him completely out of his  chair.  ""Son,"" said John, ""this robot is a lie  detector, now tell us where you really were after  school.""  ""We went to Bobby's house and watched a  movie."" said Tommy.  ""What did you watch?"" asked  Marsha.  ""The Ten Commandments."" answered  Tommy.  The robot went around to Tommy and once  again slapped him, knocking him off his  chair.  With his lip quivering, Tommy got up, sat  down and said, ""I am sorry I lied. We really watched a tape  called Sex Queen.""  ""I am ashamed of you son,""  said John. ""When I was your age, I never lied to my  parents.""  The robot walked around to John and  delivered a whack that nearly knocked him out of his  chair..  Marsha doubled over in laughter, almost  in tears and said, ""Boy, did you ever ask for that one! You  can't be too mad with Tommy. After all, he is your  son!""  The robot walked around to Marsha and  knocked her out of her chair."
