507118,thatleetboy,2010-09-27 00:35:00,143,"I posted here a while ago about looking for books to help me learn to clean fish. I've been reading some great books from the library, Including this one....  Cleaning and Preparing Gamefish: Step-by-Step Instructions, from Water to Table by Monte Burch  http://openlibrary.org/works/OL3474855W/Cleaning_and_Preparing_Gamefish   I had to work this weekend, no fishing for me. I'm hoping to take a morning off mid-week, and find a spot to fish from shore somewhere. Anyhow, I thought I should practice what I've been reading, and local Scarberia supermarket Fu Yao had fresh Red Snapper for $2.48/lb so we grabbed several and I went to town with my fillet knife in the backyard... I think I did a pretty good job, starting to have some experience, my comfort level with the knife is getting there... and this is the recipe (from the book above) we tried, quite delicious!   Wine Poached Fillets  1lb fish fillets, mild and white-meated fish Italian Dressing Dash Tabasco sauce 1 cup white wine 1/4 cup water lemon pepper garlic salt Cornstarch  Add Tabasco to the Italian dressing to taste and brush on the fish fillets. Allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the fillets with garlic salt and lemon pepper. Place the fillets in a large skillet, pour the wine and water around the fillets and poach for approx 5-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets or until fish flakes easily. Carefully remove the fillets to a warm platter. ""Reduce"" the liquid in the skillet, then stir a little cornstarch into the skillet, and cook until thickened. Spread this sauce over the skillets and serve immediately.   We used a Riesling for the white wine. All I can say is, it was yummy!  "

507382,Governator,2010-09-27 20:28:00,879,bring back a bucket of perch and after 1 session you'll be a pro adopting your own technique.  It's really about comfort with the knife and letting it do what it's suppose to do.  Keep it sharp for good results.
