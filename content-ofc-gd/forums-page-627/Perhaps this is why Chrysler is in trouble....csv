Being a Carpenter/General Contractor (and a damn good one at that) it is not worth my livelihood, to either hurt myself, an employee, or be fired from a contract. It is simply not worth it!.. not only are you endangering you're own well being but the well being of others around you.  I have to admit in my younger years I would work hungover or tired.... and these too can be dangers.. but to be High and drunk, but when others are depending on you to lead them and show proper work practices, to keep them safe.. and perhaps their future employees safe, this is unacceptable.

On the other hand, a CAW union rep told me they would almost certainly get their jobs back... all they have to do is start talking about addiction, mental health, sickness, and the union will let the slither their way back in.  I wonder what Obama has to say about this?  As the video explains, he was at that very plant weeks before speaking about his faith in the american workforce."

They have their wine with lunch...cause its what they've done since they were 12 at the farm back home.  I've never seen them binge drink...nor have I seen it affect their work.  In fact, as you say, their productivity, craftsmanship and loyalty to the company was second to none.  As a guy that works in the office...I've had a beer or maybe a glass of wine if the meal calls for it, usually with visiting clients, but its a rare event.  I'm typically useless after even one beer as I find the energy level just plummets so I generally avoid it.  But the guys in the video, they are just binge drinking and getting high for the sake of getting high, like kids in high-school hiding at the park.  I suppose their jobs are unimportant and boring to them so the look for an escape to get them through the day.  I'm not one to judge...but it just seems dumb to me. In fact dumb enough to get their intoxicated mugs plastered over national television.  Looks like its gonna be food stamps for them for a long time.  Feel bad for their kids and families"

They just hide it better and can still not be fired if they say they have a problem (Alchoholism/drug addiction). I've done factory work since 1983 and construction before that.

Like it or not it decreases production when your not on your game. They demanded top quality parts delivered with annual cost cutting measures thrown in. I certainly hope we weren't busting it just so guys like this can mess it up and make twice the money we were.

The reason for this from the dealer was he doesn't drive it enough. He has a new top of the line mini van that needed a new rear end after only one week of ownership. The dealers response was the rearend was missing a part on inspection. Maybe his vans rearend was put together by the guy puffing on the lefty at lunch. I can't wait to show him this video clip.
