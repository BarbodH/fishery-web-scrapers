It's time to dust off my gear and hook into some monster northerns. Grant? Fidel? Where are you guys? Save me!"

507266,Harrison,2010-09-27 15:40:00,2202," But if you were and whined about your partner who would you be missing?  BTW, I like my whine red with beef and white with fish and I sure do miss my mommy's omlettes."

507270,TC1OZ,2010-09-27 15:46:00,987,Welcome back!
507274,Harrison,2010-09-27 15:56:00,2202, Seems to be a pattern for sure with fishing and stringed instruments going hand in hand.  Roy may remember the fist MTG at BOQ where almost everyone was able to grab Diplips 5 string guitar and belt out a tune.  Then of course Doogle broke in with some impressive vocals.
507275,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-27 16:00:00,0,I once had a lady try to drag me away from fishing.  I even went 8 months without wetting a line. These days I'm happily married to a woman who is completely cool with fishing anytime I can get out(although I had to offer up a foot rub or two along the way)...  Welcome back to sanity.

508024,highdrifter,2010-09-30 00:22:00,2534,Welcome home brah.  Hope you take this opportunity to lay low from sport dating for a while..  I'll have my people call your people and we'll do a little esox luncheon..    He's just in between puters right now Erik.  Talked to him yesterday and he's already talking about piking downtown in his trousers..  He sends all his best and I'm confident we'll hear from him again soon.  He's got a lot of material so he must be just itching!
508103,mercman,2010-09-30 02:34:00,7054,ya just got to be honest with her.It's alot easier to introduce a new girlfriend to your passion than to decide to take up fishin later in life and introduce it to an old wife.
508122,alexmedic,2010-09-30 04:19:00,186, I feel your pain!!  x 2 for me!!
508130,Jewelbee,2010-09-30 08:35:00,422,Come on guys.....he needs to find a girl who will fish WITH him  Problem solved! Welcome back.

508217,fishing n autograph,2010-09-30 16:45:00,2540, i agree lol
508237,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-30 18:00:00,932," Heh, or he needs to find one who won't give him grief about fishing so often.  My lady knows I get cranky when I don't fish 4-6 times a week"
