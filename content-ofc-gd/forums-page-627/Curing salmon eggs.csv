The last batch that I made up I used some stuff called Atlas Shake and Cure that I bought from some sports store, and it worked pretty good actually, just be careful not to use too much of it though"

507076,shadowfly,2010-09-26 22:23:00,84, how do you water harden them ? just cold water? thanks for the tips guys i have them right now in lake water and in the jar in and in the fidge how long can i keep them the way they are now?
507077,BillM,2010-09-26 22:27:00,17367," Harden in the river once you milk them from a fish.  A stocking or legging is great for this..  Personally, I'd take them out, spread them on a baking sheet and wait until they are tacky.  If you can't vacuum seal them, just split them up into individual ziplock bags (one bag per trip is what I do), suck all the air out with a straw and put all the small bags into another large air tight ziplock and put in the freezer."
507078,shadowfly,2010-09-26 22:33:00,84,excellent thanks for the tips
507867,spinnerdoc,2010-09-29 10:20:00,556,how long do you water harden them?
507868,spinnerdoc,2010-09-29 10:21:00,556,how's it going  ryan?
507902,dave524,2010-09-29 13:41:00,4508," I do the same except I've found a quick rinse in a boracic acid solution before drying they keep a lot longer, even with just refridgeration not freezing. Boric or boracic acid is antiseptic, fungiciide , yeast killer that is used medicinally for everything from eye wash, yeast infections to a food preservative, not really a cure but kills anything that promotes spoilage before it starts."
507949,spinnerdoc,2010-09-29 17:20:00,556,would brine be ok for the same purpose?
507953,dave524,2010-09-29 17:34:00,4508,Think salt is not as effective as an killer of organisms that start the mould fungus bacterial growth rot cycle. My theory is if the eggs are sterile as far as these organisms then spoilage will not start. I do remove all air or oxygen by vacuum packaging or placing in a sealer type jar and tossing in a lit match while applying the lid. Usually I can keep them 6 months with just refridgeration.  Boric acid powder is easily available at drug store. here's the wiki on it  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boric_acid
