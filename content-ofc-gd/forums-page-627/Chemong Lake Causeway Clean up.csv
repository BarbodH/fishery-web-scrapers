They wanted me to pass the word that they will be meeting at 5:30pm, Monday Oct. 4, 2010 in the parking lot on the Ennismore side. Any help would be greatly appreciated in this good community clean-up effort.  Now I know none of us have ever left a mess and of course any garbage is someone else's fault but that does not exclude the fact that some members of our community could use a good example of resource stewardship.  So no finger pointing or blame in this post, just a big thank you in advance to anyone who can help keep our waterways and shorelines clean.  I would love to be there but I will be in Burlington for a meeting, so the volunteers have my utmost respect and appreciation.  Roll up your sleeves and help out if you can."
