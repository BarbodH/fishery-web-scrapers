508131,wormdunker,2010-09-30 08:46:00,1711,"I recently removed the head, piston, cylinder from my Polaris ATV.  Found the cylinder to be scored & the piston & rings well worn.  I had the cylinder machined & ordered a new piston & rings & new head gasket.  I'm now ready to re install the new parts.  I'm told it's very important to torque the bolts on the head to the proper spec.  Does any here know what I should torque the bolts?  Or could u suggest where I may find this info.  It's a 1996 Polaris 400cc.  Thanx for your help."
