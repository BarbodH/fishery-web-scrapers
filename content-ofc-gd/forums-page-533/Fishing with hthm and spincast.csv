587877,vinnimon,2011-05-29 23:14:00,2593,"Saturday both I and albert headed off to long point, first for a fill of perch and some piking My heart was set on pike, but I wasnt the captain JK hthm We were on the perch like there was no tomorow, double headers and lots of followers. I did manage to nail a few jumbos, but we mainly kept catching the little guys. Towards the end of the day, I decided to cast for pike while albert was committed to perching. Within 5 casts I caught one, nothing special, but it counts We caught a few rockies, a ton of perch, one oos bass, and a hammer handle Another little surprise that showed up was our own ofner Dan B, Always nice to him Sunday rolled around and over a pm , my good friend spincast asked me for a day out on lake O, I couldnt resist. I snapped the shackles and off we went. Starting off trolling in the ussual spots ,we headed deeper and deeper and deeper This was odd, we were marking them but with no interest of inhailing the georgeous lures we had  We had two lines that went off, but on the other end, their mouths must have softened up Oh well its was a great and relaxing day out with another good freind  The bonus after I got home was that I installed the starter in my boat, tinkered with a few other things and my engine finally purred like a kitten We will see what day 3 will bring me while out on the water"

587891,HTHM,2011-05-29 23:49:00,4082,"The trolling motor was the only electrical that has been trouble free, you did a GREAT job on that.   Your dash work was screwed up by the fellow who rigged the motor,other wise it would have been fine."
