587568,Terry,2011-05-28 21:46:00,14456, when the number one boat is broken you go number 2  I guess that should read you go with number 2 boat... yeah that sounds better.....  loaded the folding boat on the roof rack of the liberty diesel and off I went  the water was real dirty and still cold we only got rock bass and silver bass in the main spot so we ran to the second spot and started getting fish right away  lots of perch were biting     a whole bunch of these were hungry too       some nice sized walleye were biting too    all were released to fight another day   it's just great getting on the water  who needs a big boat to go fishing  but  it had better be ready this week so I can run way out on simcoe for some spring white fish and trout
587575,danc,2011-05-28 22:05:00,4677,Nice day you had Terry.
587577,Bernie,2011-05-28 22:14:00,3190,Very good Terry! You gotta fish to catch them  I'd sure be tempted to keep that pickerel.
587585,Mike01,2011-05-28 22:56:00,378,I'd like to see a picture of that boat
587586,irishfield,2011-05-28 22:57:00,26272,Best damn thing I ever sold you !!! lol  Glad you got out... wish I had the free time to do so myself and we could get out in my boat (that's just sitting in the hangar keeping mice comfy!)

587616,mistyriver1,2011-05-29 01:09:00,600,"Nice going Terry !!  Was out there last weekend, hoping to get out again tomorrow...."
587619,ehg,2011-05-29 01:15:00,2666,Nice variety of fish Was thinking Cook's Bay where walleye are probably uncommon.
587624,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-29 01:25:00,2690,"Nice Terry!!  That walleye is a beauty. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, or you gotta use what you gotta use.  You got out, you got fish, you gotta love it"
587636,Joey,2011-05-29 01:48:00,9122,"Right on Terry, that's a sweet pickerel too  Looks like the wind gave you a break this time too"
587638,johnnyb,2011-05-29 01:55:00,3413,Awesome that you got out....the best boat is one that's got fish in it

587733,RickOnt,2011-05-29 13:17:00,669,"A ""Beauty"" Pickerel  Rick"
587758,Mike01,2011-05-29 14:36:00,378,"very cool, how fast does it go? Does it take on much water?"
587794,Terry,2011-05-29 16:20:00,14456,it doesn't take on water  with a 5 hp it goes 12 mph for me...  they are very stable boats
587795,misfish,2011-05-29 16:23:00,29133,Get your other boat will ya. I cant fish out of that thing.LOL Nice report bud.
587819,Carp,2011-05-29 17:47:00,1488," MICE !!! Set the traps regularly Wayne ! If they get in the boat, they'll destroy your seats/carpet, pfd's, rags or any other material suitable for a nest. Might even make the nest in the seat itself.  My neighbour has a 19 ft. glass boat that was damaged by racoons over the winter. It has a full top (snap on) + other tarps over that. They still got in. He spent $3500 to re-upholster the seats and replace the carpeting.  I had a pair of coveralls hanging in the garage. Momma made a nest out of one pocket. Lots of small holes where they chewed the material."
587840,Mike01,2011-05-29 20:23:00,378,I want one!!

588053,Headhunter,2011-05-30 13:33:00,5703,Sweet Pickereye Terry! If only you could catch them like in the fall! HH
588108,Leecher,2011-05-30 16:41:00,7832,Great job Terry Nothing wrong with boat #2    Got to love plan B sometimes  How heavy is the boat when it's all put together?  without the motor and gear?
