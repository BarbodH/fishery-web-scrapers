588064,ccmtcanada,2011-05-30 14:12:00,7971,"Wow Terry!  I feel your pain!  This is why I just changed everything to Bell...I've been a rogers customer for decades, but when I called to find out what can be done about pricing and a competitive quote from Bell, they said ""We'll match Bell's price for 12 months with a contract"".  I said ""Bell offered 2 years with no contract"".  They said ""call back in 11 months and see if we have a promo"".  I said ""No thanks...see ya later!"""
588151,Governator,2011-05-30 18:51:00,879,"People have to know there is absolutely no apples and oranges difference within a monopoly of two giants.  Rogers or Bell, people will eventually have a bad experience over time with either service from either company.  It's what happens when call centers are spread out over mass areas and their only main competition are each other.  It's well known that Bell has call centers in India, as far as I know Rogers only uses Canadian call centers.  It doesn't change the experience all that much to be honest.  You just get the shortest queue line.  I was with Bell with all services until they gave me an insane $1700 bill out of no where for a phone number I never owned that was apparently hooked up 4 years prior.  I even had the stupid service rep reverse lookup the phone number which proved it was routed to the Police Station, not my address yet it still took 6 months to clear that off my name after about 8hrs worth of phone calls over that time.  That could've ruined me in credit rating.  It of course was the final straw for me and I switched.  Without a lot of options though they don't really give a crap if you switch, someone else will switch from the other anyway.  It's different if there are 6 different top companies fighting for position, they need you then, Bell or Rogers don't need you and don't need to give better promos than their competitor to keep you."

They always promise everything when you buy something but then they over bill you and under deliver on services... Thanks to the useless clowns who run the CRTC they own us and the governments.  I did want to point though that by mentioning Rogers guess who's ad got top billing on your thread? YEP the company you complained about at least you tried to warn anybody wanting to try the special deal their are offering LOL."

587829,Marko,2011-05-29 18:47:00,854,"Rogers is the worst company in the world...with even worse customer service. Every time i used to have to call them, i`d get that feeling in my stomach because i knew it would not end good."
587835,uglyfish,2011-05-29 19:28:00,981,"agreed, worst company ever! horrible products, even worse customer service, complete crooks! i cant even repeat most of my conversations ive had with them..... there would be too many holes in the text for removed profanity. lol"

There are options and they will comply when pushed.  Ted died, but they still live well with our payments!"

587864,coreyhkh,2011-05-29 22:10:00,163,Both rogers and bell are crap and they just take advantage of us because there is just two big players. two months ago I got rid of rogers for good and got teksavvy it was a much better deal.
587902,toca,2011-05-30 00:19:00,274,after five years people would be talking trash about teksavvy
587912,uglyfish,2011-05-30 00:49:00,981,All these new smaller companies coming out are just working off the big companies service and are usually owned by the big company... So they will still screw u some how lol
587916,BillM,2011-05-30 00:54:00,17367,"Retentions is a great department, I've saved quite a bit by threatening to leave (Bell and Rogers)"
587917,irishfield,2011-05-30 00:55:00,26272,If we were all smart we'd go back to the rotary dial phone! They are what they are... a FOR PROFIT business. I try to give them as little as I can. I've had a total of THREE cell phones since 1985. The first one cost me $1799.99 + tax in 1985. I retired it.. or should I say the rain that leaked thru the motorhome windshield at Lakair in 2006 put it out of commission. Replaced with a 10 cent hersheybar phone off ebay and then Rogers went GSM and gave me a free phone that I'm still using.
587995,walleyejack,2011-05-30 03:01:00,358," Yup, had mine reduced after telling them i was leaving,reduced by 100 two yrs ago snd they started slinking it up at the end of the yr,called em,they reduced it 150 for a year,which is up in nov. squeaky wheel gets the grease."
588003,muskymike,2011-05-30 03:25:00,772,"I have had Rogers and Cogeco for combined services and I would take Rogers 10 out of 10 times if I had the choice. (I am currently being screwed by Cogeco again) I have also had Rogers, Bell and Telus for cell service, and again would pick Rogers every time.  Why you ask? No, I do not have any ties to Rogers in anyway. It is simply because they all suck, BUT Rogers will give you stuff for being so bad. No one at Bell speaks English, Telus didn't care if I left, so I did, and Rogers will reduce your bill or give you services for free for being so horrible.  I would love to try a DSL provider like Tekksavy, but they are not available where I currently live. All I know is Cogeco is almost twice as expensive as Rogers for the same services (Phone/Cable/Internet) and their customer service is non-existent. Literally, I am not sure if they have a clue what even bad service is, I can not even get far enough on the phone with them to consider it bad. It ends as soon as I call.  I feel like my last 20 posts have all had negative undertones. Not sure why. Sorry, I just dont think any one of these providers is better then the other for services, only how bad their customer services is."
588004,Handlebarz,2011-05-30 03:41:00,3790,Kinda sounds like the same thing my wife went through with KUDO if I had the time and skill to make it wound as great as you did Terry I would add her story but lets just say my daughter now has a nice phone that will not call anywhere out of screaming distance. But it does take good pictures LOL.
588024,Teressa,2011-05-30 11:00:00,55,"We had bell home phone until the 25th. Over the last 5 years we have called bell to get them to repair the lines coming in from the highway many times. The repair guys have told us that from the highway to our house (less than 1 KM) the line has been spliced 22 times, and that they will not replace it. Bell did try to get us to stay with them, but did not offer us any incentives.  I had rogers cell phone also for about 5 years. I had great reception, but lousy service and prices too high. Again, was not offered any incentive to stay with them.  Now I have Koodo for cell (3 of them actually mine, my daughter's and my boyfriend). We have had it for about 4 months. No complaints as of yet for quality for calls or text, it takes great pictures. Prices are very reasonable for what we wanted. Grateful for the unlimited text as my daughter has used over 15 000 in the last 30 days.  Internet, we were stuck on dial-up here and only connecting at 21 - 24 kbps since 2006. We finally bit the bullet about 2 months ago and went with netspectrum for high speed wireless. As of this moment, we can not be happier with it."
588052,Headhunter,2011-05-30 13:31:00,5703,"Terry, sorry that you have had this much cow manure to deal with... perhaps next time you go into a Rogers store, you might want to borrow my pink gloves as they would help make the insertion much less messy and the clean up that much easier! HH"
