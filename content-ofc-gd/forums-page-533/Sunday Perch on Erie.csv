588098,Bondar,2011-05-30 16:18:00,817,"Sunday morning Dad and i Loaded up the boat and headed out to Lake erie for some perch having been out the a couple weeks Prior i decided I was going to run the plastic baits for a bit  to make things a little more interesting for me , so i rigged up a drop shot rig and an xzone shiver shad and went to work , didnt take us long till we found a decent school for big perch and worked them for about an hour . Then just like that they were off the graph and the bite died so we got on the electric and motored around and found them again ! this happened a couple times in the 4 hours we were out there ! Fish seemed to be on the outside of the crowds i could hear people talking they were having a hard time catching but in a pack of 30 boats banging and clanging around its not hard to figure out why .......  anyhow i took a couple pics when we got home I didnt have time to take any on the water except for one . Get out there if you can lots of fish around Contact the local shop and they can point you in the right direction on what where and how     "
