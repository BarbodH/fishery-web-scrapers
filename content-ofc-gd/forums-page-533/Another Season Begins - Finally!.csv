Boat rigging, work, and lousy weather has taken up a lot of my time....and kept me off the water. Was fortunate to get out on opening day last week with Yannick of Ottawa River Guided Fishing for pike and headed out for two days of fishing on the Rideau this week.  The pike co-operated and some fun was definitely had...      Check out my blog for the full report and more pics:  http://justinhoffmanoutdoors.wordpress.com/2011/05/28/another-season-begins/  Good Fishing,  Justin"
