587394,Slayingm,2011-05-27 23:41:00,204,Wow!!!... The weather may have been a little rainy and overcast today and surprized not to see another boat fishing today but the action was awesome!  Had some clients out today and we got into some really nice fish including a couple of pigs! Whities and Lakers came on large Rapala jiggn Raps and small white tubes and all fish caught in 65 - 72' of water. Attached a pic of a 16 plus and another Laker pushing 20lbs! Have a another full day trip booked for tomorrow and can't wait to get out! Be safe and Good Fish'n.... Greg.

587852,Slayingm,2011-05-29 21:15:00,204,Thanks guys.... its was a awesome day and not one soon forgotten for sure! Fishing was really slow on Sat... we did get a 7lb Whitefish and another just under 4lbs.... lots of fish coming up to look at the lures then moving away again... saw that happen dozens of times. The bugs (nats) were horrendous again!  Take care and Good Fish' n... Greg.
