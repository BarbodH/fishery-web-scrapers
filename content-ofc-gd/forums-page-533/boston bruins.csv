587442,corvette1,2011-05-28 03:41:00,1765,for all you boston fans were going to the big show 21 long years go bruins
587443,irishfield,2011-05-28 03:41:00,26272,Too bad it's gonna be the end of the line!!!
587446,corvette1,2011-05-28 03:46:00,1765,hey wayne its never over till the fat lady sings
587448,anders,2011-05-28 03:53:00,1168,"i am absolutely jacked...so excited...win or lose, really proud to be a Bruins fan!"
587449,Twocoda,2011-05-28 03:53:00,4130,Im kinda glad Boston won....this translates to ensuring the CUP stays in Canada
587451,umKthxbye,2011-05-28 04:10:00,247,"Canucks already won, they are just continuing for tradition."
587502,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-28 13:49:00,4399,"Most here know how I feel about the Bruins!!!but I guess a thank-you is in order, the thought of a Florida based team winning the cup again just made my skin crawl!!!  Go Canucks!!!"
587508,otter649,2011-05-28 14:49:00,118,Kind of ironic that Horton would score the game/series winning goal after spraying water & throwing a water bottle at a fan after game six.....
587512,Lungelarry,2011-05-28 15:26:00,294,"GO BOSTON GO....all the way,oringinal 6.As for Horton and water, the hockey gods seemed to be on his side...lol "
587532,Stoty,2011-05-28 17:39:00,2910,Canucks in 5 Thomas will steal one of the games in Boston... but Van has WAY too much fire power for the Bruins to defend!
587540,bow slayer,2011-05-28 19:00:00,1074,"Vancouver being able to roll 4 lines and overall depth,and team speed combined with Boston's lack of depth on the blueline has the making of this being a short series ,I think 5 but Thomas maybe able to steal 2.Boston has not seen a team this good so far in the playoffs and needed 7 games to beat 2 of them. Vancouver has already beat better teams than Boston in both San Jose and Chicago,and Nashville is about even with Boston. The west is just stronger just look at  the record between conferences this year."
587558,Handlebarz,2011-05-28 20:53:00,3790,I like Boston alot but have to cheer the Canucks it just seems wrong to cheer for a non Canadian team if we have one in the finals. Heck I would be cheering along the Habs if they made it that far.  Either way its going to be a great series
587563,jediangler,2011-05-28 21:18:00,1923,The Bruins will win because Luongo will choke and the Sedins will get lambasted by Chara. Look for Bergeron to really take charge of this series. Recchi will retire after winning the cup again. Bruins in 5.
587599,Lungelarry,2011-05-29 00:16:00,294,"Hey Jediangler,I like the way you think"
587673,dhickey,2011-05-29 04:28:00,1038,  BOSTON will crush the girls and send them all going home on a plane crying for mummy!!! The girls out west dont have any grit or personal will to win LORD STANLEYS CUP!! Other than personal financial gain and that dosent cut it in the big show.  BOSTON in 6 overtime...
