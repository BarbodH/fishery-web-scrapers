This week, I'm taking a bunch of guys from work down to do a little shore casting for perch.  Anyone having any luck around the marina, or public docks for perch in the past few days/weeks?  I was also thinking about trying to catch a pike from shore.   I haven't tried shore fishing for Pike in Barrie.  Anyone ever catch a Pike from shore in Barrie?  I was thinking about trying near Hooters."

Tried by hooters, public docks, break wall, and by the beach volley ball courts.  Nada..  Beauty day though.  Had a great time, even though I didn't get what I set out for!"
