So; I've managed to accumulate a surplas of about 50 skids (plenty to go around). If anybody is interested in bringing a skill saw & crowbar and cuttting up some wood, PM me and I will give you my address. I am located at Hurontario (hwy 10) & the 401.  I'll even provide the strapping material so you can bundle it.  Regards, Slayer  BTW, skids are 'clean'. They have not been used to transport heavy metals or chemicals."
