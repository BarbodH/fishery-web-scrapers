588274,HTHM,2011-05-30 23:39:00,4082,"I have my Hummingbird within 6"" of my am/fm radio antenna on the Ranger, last Saturday I noticed that the reception would work when the Fish Finder was off, but the radio would not pick up a signal (radio station)when it was on. I would like to avoid moving the antenna if I can, but I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem and how it was solved?"
588277,Ron,2011-05-30 23:45:00,1683,"I got same problem. I ended up moving my antenna. Hind sight, I should have put my fish finder on a gimble mount and located it in a better, user friendly location."
588292,Tom McCutcheon,2011-05-31 00:37:00,627,Same problem....solved by installing an XM satelite radio.
588293,Tom McCutcheon,2011-05-31 00:39:00,627, Ron... I thought the Feds. made sure that all internet was taken away from the bad guys in the crow bar hotel.  How did you make out?
588307,Fisherman,2011-05-31 01:17:00,7201,"F/F's have a transmitter circuit in them to power the transducer, very similar to a radio or TV station. Your AM/FM is a receiver and when they are co located that close, the F/F will bleed into the radio, distance is about the only thing other than a custom made filter for the radio."
588311,HTHM,2011-05-31 01:23:00,4082,"Well it looks like distance it is, now to plug a hole in the helm, and rearrange my layout....*sigh*"
588314,vinnimon,2011-05-31 01:32:00,2593,"The best way I found was with the ff on at max including the light, was to move the antanae around while on a weak station. Once you found a decent reception then stay near to a sutible mount for it.  "
