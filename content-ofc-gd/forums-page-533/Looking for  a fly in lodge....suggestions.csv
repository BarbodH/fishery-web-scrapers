First at Casa Blanca, and the last five years at Crane's Lochaven Lodge. We are so high on the Crane's hospitality and the French ambience to go there at least once a year as long as I can forsee. However, I'm getting a bit up in age and was thinking of a fly in trip for some really great fishing for him to experience this August. Obviously a fly in, but good consistent fishing in the farther north. Thinking northern Ontario, Manitba, NWT, Quebec, or Saskwtchawan (sp?). Looking for some ideas. Thanks in advance."

Some of these trips can be really expensive...however there are some board members that can suggest relatively inexpensive spots with outstanding fishing."

588306,dhickey,2011-05-31 01:12:00,1038,How far north are you willing to go? What kind of fish are you looking for?
588329,adempsey,2011-05-31 02:05:00,1498,"Outpost or lodge?  If you're willing to go to NWT or Manitoba, I am sure you will find somewhere amazing - unfortunately, have not yet been to either."
