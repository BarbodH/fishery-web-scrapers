I plan on taking the wife and nephew and we love to camp and always like a nice campgrounds that is semi-private, wooded etc to add to the camping experience for the little guy.  More importantly there needs to be a boat launch fairly close so I am able to get out and do some fishing.  Any personal experiences, phone numbers, etc would be appreciated.  If you do not want to post on the board please PM me.  Any basic fishing advice based on the month, species etc would be great.  Thanks in advance,  BiggFish"
