The Pike needed glasses with all the following and missed passes. But we got a couple ... and it's fun to watch them follow the lure in. It clouded over and that's all they needed. We caught about 16 pike in the next hour ... but none of any size. We kept a couple for breakfast. Love eating Pike, just hate cleaning them.  "
