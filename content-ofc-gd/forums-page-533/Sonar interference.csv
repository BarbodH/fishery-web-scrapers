588320,Terry,2011-05-31 01:49:00,14456,if you have more then one battery on your boat run one of them to the other battery you can also put a ferrite core choke on the power line.....
588358,walleyejack,2011-05-31 03:12:00,358,"Thank you guys.I was looking how it was wired again,I misdiagnosed,the marine radion and the gps are tied together and and hooked in to the circut breaker,the sonar / gps unit is hooked into a circut breaker,could it be possible,when i turn the Garmin on that it interferes with the sonar/gps unit ? It is the Eagle Fishelite 502c. I thought they were tied together,but they aren't. Maybe run wire from Eagle to the battery direct and see how that goes."
