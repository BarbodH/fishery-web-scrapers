Lots of lakes, but just wondered if anyone has tried this app and if so how good is it.  It is $13 for the app, so its not a major investment lost if its not any good, but thought I'd throw it out there and see if there is any feedback about it."
587896,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-29 23:55:00,4399,I have used it a couple of times and it works well!
587898,Lunatic,2011-05-30 00:00:00,536,"there was a topic here about it not so long ago,i wanted to get it but after going to their website i looked at the list of lakes they have and not one of the lakes i like to fish were on there."
587901,rufus,2011-05-30 00:15:00,267,I have Navionics on my HTC and also on iphone and it works and is accurate. I don't really get cell phone coverage for most of the area I fish however so don't use it much.
587968,Black_Blade,2011-05-30 02:08:00,258,"yes, that is a good point, but does the fact that you can't get cellular coverage affect whether it can connect to the gps signals?  I have the option to turn on gps reception..."
587977,Homer Is King,2011-05-30 02:28:00,305,"It's a great app for the price. I have it on my iPhone and love it. Well worth the ~$15!  The GPS on you cell phone is not true GPS. Real GPS units use satellites to triangulate your location. Cell phone ""GPS"" uses cell towers to calculate your position."
587989,EC1,2011-05-30 02:54:00,930,I almost will not go in my canoe without it now! Helps a ton to know exactly where you are and where there is good water close by.
588001,BillM,2011-05-30 03:15:00,17367," What you are referring to is A-GPS (cell tower triangulation)   Alot of phones these days have a true GPS receiver. (iPhone, HTC, etc etc) that work just fine even when out of cell range."
588086,archie_james_c,2011-05-30 15:36:00,618,I'm gonna download this for my iPhone right now. I'm working at Loch Island lodge on Wabatongushi....well see if it has any lakes around here
