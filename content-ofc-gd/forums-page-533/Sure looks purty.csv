587331,misfish,2011-05-27 20:26:00,29133,"Been on the fence about buying a new truck for sometime,but just couldnt bring myself to making payments for 4 years. The ole ford was getting a bit rough and didnt know if it was worth getting beautified. Well, I got an estimate that was easy on the wallet,so went with the make over. Glad I did. The guy that did the work went out of his way and beyond. All new metal in the repair spots,even pulled out that nasty rear panel damage,very little cheese was used. This guy is good. For 1800 bucks I got a bumper to bumper makeover. Very pleased. Good for another 5 years wouldnt ya say.         "
587333,Joey,2011-05-27 20:28:00,9122,"Looks brand new B, great job"

587343,lew,2011-05-27 21:05:00,12766,Lookin real good Brian !!
587346,GBW,2011-05-27 21:15:00,8460,"wow, great work!  it cost me $1,300 to get my hood and door repainted when my car was keyed so I'll say that's one heck of a deal you got!!"
587366,irishfield,2011-05-27 22:38:00,26272,What midnight shop did the work??? $1800.. cost my sister $1050 to have a ladies door repainted that she scraped in Mount Sinai Hospitals parking lot.  Looks like he even pulled the door seals and panels to paint inside!!! Unbelievable for that money!
587367,aplumma,2011-05-27 22:40:00,6896,Nice looken truck except for that defect in the picture of the grill....   Art
587371,misfish,2011-05-27 22:46:00,29133," And to think,a frechman did this work.LOL    He,s a great guy. Could of past off as a newf,it it wasnt for the accent.   Lets see if I can make you feel even worse Geoff.LOL  Heres the break down as far as repair goes.  First there was a big dent in the rear panel.Pulled it out like it was never dented.(I really should of done a before/during and after) Then the third door was rotten on the bottom. The rocker panels were shot. The floor joining them was rotten. The drivers/passanger door bottom was rotten aswell. Tail gate was rusting out on the bottom aswell. Like I mentioned before,all was cut out and replaced with new metal. No welding was done. They use a high tec chaulking that is used by the manufactures (80 bucks a tube). The grill was faded,he repainted that aswell. The headlights were so baddly fadded,he said for 40 bucks more,I,ll wet sand them and look close to new.  After seeing it today,I want to see her pulling a bass boat again. Ah wait,theres payments again.  Thanks for the comments all.      Rightway collision Wayne.   See you at Lakair.  Should add,it,s going in for an oil bath along with the mrs,s Focus next friday."
587373,HTHM,2011-05-27 22:49:00,4082,Put a for sale sign on it now while it still looks good.
587378,misfish,2011-05-27 22:53:00,29133, Yes he did.
587382,misfish,2011-05-27 23:01:00,29133," No way.  Just put a new sound system in it too. Overtime hours ,made this possible.LOL"
587387,lew,2011-05-27 23:17:00,12766," I bought my F-150 new last year  and 30 days after picking it up someone backed into it and left a 1/4"" deep, 12"" long gouge in the rear passenger door, then took off.  I took it back to the dealer where they repaired the gouge and repainted the door for $400"
587391,irishfield,2011-05-27 23:23:00,26272,"I hear ya Lew.. dealer took care of you. When my sister asked, I told her it would probably cost $700 to repaint.. as she was adamant there was no dent (which I told her was impossible if the paint was to bare metal). Turned out is was a BMW.. and she probably got stiffed a tad!"
587392,lew,2011-05-27 23:26:00,12766," Lotsa that going around Wayne, unfortunately."
587431,Bernie,2011-05-28 02:31:00,3190,Looks real nice Brian. Good price for sure. Red paint is the most expensive as well.
587434,Leecher,2011-05-28 03:14:00,7832,Pimp my ride MTV lol She's looking real good B
587469,misfish,2011-05-28 11:03:00,29133," Bernie  You are right,and the paint he used is an enviromental friendly paint. It,s thicker then the norm,and he said it,s a little harder to spray as far as controlling runs.   Not done yet Jac. Theres a cover on order for the box."
587473,Machine57,2011-05-28 11:10:00,22,"Hey brian looks great!!!...Can you post the  repair guy's info or send me a PM with it. I am also in Barrie and the Brides car needs a little makeover. Thanx, Dan"
587504,BrownTown,2011-05-28 14:27:00,103,"Fine looking job there, WOW! My turn to contemplate on retiring the old chevy..She has a bit of love rust and needs a few things...ohh man."
