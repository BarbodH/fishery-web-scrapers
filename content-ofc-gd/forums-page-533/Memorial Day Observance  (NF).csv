Watched the National Memorial Day Concert last evening for the very first time and it was a very moving experience as folks shared their stories.  I guess we really can't comprehend what war is like, unless we were actually there.  To all those who served .... THANK YOU.     And to all my friends up north, we have served together throughout the world and your sacrifice was just a great.  To you I also say  THANK YOU.  We were asked at our church yesterday that, at 11:00am today, stop whatever you are doing and remember those who gave their lives, so that we can have ours today.   Then, at 3:00pm, stop and pray for peace.  THANK YOU to all our service men and women.  I know we have veterans on this site as well and I stop to say THANK YOU as well."
