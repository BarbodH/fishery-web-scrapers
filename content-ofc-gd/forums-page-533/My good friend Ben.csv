587712,lunkerbasshunter,2011-05-29 11:46:00,2585,very sorry to hear that!  Looks like a wonderful dog!  Cheers!
587241,Squid,2011-05-27 16:10:00,1656,"Yesterday was a very melancholy day in the Rajewski household. Our dear friend/brother Ben was laid to rest after 15 glorious years of friendship and laughter that was evident to the very end. He touched hundreds of peopleâ€™s lives during his time with us and he was by far the best dog (friend) that we ever owned. Kind, gentle and calm to a fault. I recall when Ben was 3 a woman approached us and stated that Ben was very well behaved and calm for a 8 yr old dog. She was shocked when we informed her that he was only 3 years old. His greatest passion was chilling out. More of a speed bump than a dog. He guarded our family with ferocity if there was a stranger at the door so he was no push over, unless you threw him a rib bone.  Rest in peace Ben, chase those squirrels in dog heaven and have lots of fun with your friends that passed before you.  "
587243,lew,2011-05-27 16:19:00,12766,"Very sorry to hear the news Pete.  I know Ben's been feeling rough for awile now and you said yourself it was only a matter of time, although that doesn't make it any easier.  He was a great friend to you and your family for along time and your gonna have lotsa fond memories for many years.  Condolances from myself, Diane, Sheri and Marvin."
587244,Handlebarz,2011-05-27 16:25:00,3790,Dang Pete sorry to here of the news. I can only imagine he had a good role model to build him into the seep bump he was. Ya can see his smile in them pictures RIP Ben
587252,Joey,2011-05-27 16:49:00,9122,"Very sorry to hear that Pete.  Ben will obviously be very missed.  Paul and I are also grieving the death of our beloved cat Felix.  He was no regular cat (more like a dog) and he passed 3 weeks ago after 18 years.  I am astonished how much I miss the little guy.  Our hearts were broken as I'm sure yours is right now.  So I feel for ya bud, going through the same feeling right now  Joey"

I can certainly see it in his eyes in the second picture on the right. That one is a window into his soul. You can just tell he was a special one. So sorry for your loss."
587459,Jewelbee,2011-05-28 08:24:00,422,"I am so sorry to hear of your loss. He looks like a wonderful dog!  Three score and ten are given to man, But ours is a much briefer span. So, though I give you all my heart, The time will come when we must part. But all around you, you will see, Creatures that speak to you of me; A tired horse, a hunted thing, A sparrow with a broken wing ... Pity - and help (I know you will) And somehow, I will be with you still; And I shall know, although I'm gone, The love I gave you lingers on. --- (Author unknown) ---"
