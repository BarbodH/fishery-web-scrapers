587542,Bernie,2011-05-28 19:19:00,3190,"As many of you already know, two outboards were worked on this year. The first one is on display but the second was destined to be put on my old cedar. Well the finishing details were finally completed this morning with the application of the decals and a couple other pieces. Had to shave the transom a little to get it to fit on. The older engines don't open up as wide.    Fired it up and went for a spin. Whoo Hoo! Works great, zips right along.    A thank you goes out to Wayne for the heads up he gave me on an auction last summer."
587543,Roy,2011-05-28 19:24:00,13728,"That is beautiful!! A real piece of art, Bernie. I remember my jaw hitting the desk when I saw the one you did that's now on display. You can't even put a price on those things. Congrats to you!"
587544,tb4me,2011-05-28 19:33:00,3295,Very nice indeed! Id love a boat like that for the grand here in Brantofrd. Good job.
587545,Bernie,2011-05-28 19:36:00,3190,Thanks Roy. They are a work of art. So well made. Stop by and we will take it out to troll for some muskie.
587547,Bernie,2011-05-28 19:42:00,3190, Thank you  New ones are still being made. PM me if you need more info.
587548,lew,2011-05-28 19:47:00,12766,Really great to see you giving those old gems a 2nd life Bernie and seeing them on the cedarstrips sure brings back some fond memories.
587549,irishfield,2011-05-28 19:49:00,26272,Walter Bowen would be estatic to see his pride and joy in such great hands Bernie! You did a marvelous job bringing her back on line.
587550,Bernie,2011-05-28 19:55:00,3190," It does for me as well Lew.   Although I never had the pleasure of meeting him I think of him when I work on it. He had his name written on the inside of the hood. I left it there.  New points, coils, fuel lines, water pump and carb kit. Runs as smooth as new."
587551,mercman,2011-05-28 20:01:00,7054,"Bernie, what can i say......Just beautiful Looks exactly like the boat and motor Dad used to take us boys fishing in when  i was just a wee lad.Thanks for bringing back the nostalgia.  Paul"
587552,irishfield,2011-05-28 20:05:00,26272,"  A nice touch Bernie and if you don't mind I'm gonna share these pictures and thoughts with Walter's wife Margaret. I think it will bring a smile to her face, seeing how someone cares for these old gems like her dearly departed husband did."
587555,Bernie,2011-05-28 20:20:00,3190,Don't mind at all Wayne. I hope it does bring her a smile.
587557,bushart,2011-05-28 20:44:00,2628,Beauty job----evidence of true appreciation
587560,John,2011-05-28 20:58:00,2956,Truly a thing of beauty Bernie.
587564,Bernie,2011-05-28 21:19:00,3190," Always had a cedar around Paul. That particular boat was made in 1949. My grandfather died in 1950. So he had a hand in making that one. Makes it extra special. I fixed it up a couple winters ago.   Thank you Bushart. Your art is also to be appreciated, you do very good work.   The original designer deserves the credit for them John. All I did was paint it!"
587567,aplumma,2011-05-28 21:42:00,6896,Bernie is that one of the cedar strips from your boat shop? The whole project looks excellent but I would expect nothing less from you.   Art
587569,Spiel,2011-05-28 21:48:00,9065,"Nothing less than outstanding Bernie, you have true talent and a great eye for detail. Well done indeed!  Oh and leaving Walter's name on the inside of the cowling, very classy."
587572,Bernie,2011-05-28 21:56:00,3190," Yes it is. It is an early version of the ""Powassan Special"". A narrow body 16 ft. It's light enough to pull up on shore single handed and roll over to clean if necessary. I'd prefer the ""Nipissing"" model such as the ones at Lakair as they are more stable but this is a fun one to drive. It was in fair shape when I got her but the cedar was badly discolored, beyond sanding the stains out. So I painted it the same colors as the old cottage. Just happens to match the colors on the 1958 Johnson."
587614,fishnsled,2011-05-29 01:08:00,3520," It's really quite amazing how it all came together. Once again, great job Bernie."
587620,craigdritchie,2011-05-29 01:15:00,1586,"That really is magnificent, Bernie. Thanks for sharing those photos! Gorgeous rig!"
587641,Bernie,2011-05-29 01:59:00,3190, This is quite a compliment coming from a man that makes an exquisite fishing rod. Thank you Chris.   It's a great winter project to do these Will. I have several to choose from for next winter.   Thank you Craig. It was an idea a couple years in the making. Takes a while to put all the plans in place. I have a line on another one identical to this. Thinking about putting the pair on maybe a new one. Very preliminary plan at this point.
587686,motv8tr,2011-05-29 07:47:00,2587,"Very nice Bernie, I missed the one you put on display, but it must have been something if this one is any indication.  Maureen"
587694,Billy Bob,2011-05-29 10:03:00,5865,Everyone has already said it...but I need to say just one thing Bernie...  SWEET  Bob
