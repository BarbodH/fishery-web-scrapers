587828,johnnyb,2011-05-29 18:44:00,3413,"Never been....but did a bit of reading at some point, as they aren't too far from my parents' place.  Basically tea coloured bass lakes...smallies/largies as well as perch and rockbass.  Supposedly walleye have been attempted by stocking, but have never stuck around...the theory being that it's a lot of bare bedrock or mud, and not many tributaries....so no good spawning grounds for them."
587844,LegitFish,2011-05-29 20:41:00,69," That's what I read on the MNR lake fact sheet, but as I was checking pictures from the Muldrew Website and I saw that someone had caught a Pike... I guess there's a few in there  Either way looks like a nice area"
