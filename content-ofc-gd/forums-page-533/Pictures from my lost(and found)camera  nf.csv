The day i lost it was the day we had just recorded an hour in the boat with our son Jack.  I can hardly describe how upset i was to return home to realise i'd lost the camera with some really nice pics of our little cruise.  They were so special for us because as a record of Jack's progress they were priceless.He talked about going in the ""byeboat"" all winter, and to see his excitement...and hesitation at finally being in the boat was awesome. last year he was not able to really even stand alone in the boat, this year he was ""telling"" me to go faster  Anyway...yup...more pics of my boy...i love the little dood so much. Here's some of the pics from our first ""byeboat"" outing this year.   WE BROUGHT SOME BREAD TO FEED THE GULLS....JACK DOES AN AWESOME SEAGULL IMPRESSION BTW                  I REMEMBER EATING MORE THAN I GAVE TO THE BIRDS WHEN I WAS A WEE LAD TOO...LOL           AFTER FEEDING THE BIRDS WE SET OFF TO NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR...JACK SEEMED A BIT UNSURE OF THE WHOLE ""BYEBOAT"" EXPERIENCE        BUT HE STARTED TO RELAX SOON ENOUGH                     CONFIDENCE GROWING, HE WANTED HIS INDEPENDENCE            HE WAS ALL SMILES WHEN WE TOOK HIM TO SEE THE FLOAT PLANES            EVEN GOT TO SEE ONE COME IN AND LAND IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE      IT WAS GETTING LATE SO WE CAME ASHORE.      LOTS OF 'STUFF"" TO SEE AND DO STILL               AND JUST BEFORE WE LEFT..A FRIENDLY LAB CAME TO PLAY TOO                    Hope you enjoyed the pics...we took some great videos of the day too. So glad we got the camera back....would have been such a shame to have lost those pictures!  Thanks for indulging me in my proud dadhood thing again...it wont be the last time...lol."
