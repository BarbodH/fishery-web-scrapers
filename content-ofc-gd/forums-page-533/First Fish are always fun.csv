After watching literally hundreds of people, young and old catch their first, I can honestly say it is a thrill that never diminishes.  Thanks to all who attended.  Mike and Andrea."

Thanks to all who have attended our Family days so far this year. One more to go on June 11 at Bewdley, 10-4. Come out to meet Minister of Tourism, Michael Chan. You might end up on the Angler and Hunter TV show as new host Mike Miller will be at the event filming.   Plus a tagged prize fish was caught Thursday afternoon off one of the docks in Bewdley. I have it on good information that there are a few more in the area. get you button but more important, grab the family and get out fishing together.  "
