941144,Woodsman,2015-10-22 22:27:00,1286,Just ordered my first ATV for icefishing & scenic trails. A 2016 450 Can Am Outlander L Max DPS. 
941146,davey buoy,2015-10-22 22:35:00,5505,"Very nice,congrats,that's what I need,going to be another year or so for me. Have fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
941149,Woodsman,2015-10-22 22:55:00,1286,I'll be up in your area at times through the icefishing season so if you need a ride out to the grounds I could give you a ride if you have a proper helmet & meet me at launch point. With my schedule it could be any day of the week depending on weather & my work days.
941151,Sinker,2015-10-22 22:58:00,8692,Nice! We tossed and turned over whether to get a sled or quad.....then a great deal on a sled came along.....bring on the snow!  Quad is the goal for next year.  S.
941157,ecmilley,2015-10-22 23:27:00,2163,"nice congrats on your purchase, lookin at sxs myself right now, but to much of a sled head"
941158,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-22 23:33:00,10439,I need a quad too. Just have to build and pay for my cabin first.
941160,Fisherman,2015-10-22 23:41:00,7201,"Now here's one thing to keep an eye on.  We have 2 of them at work however the 650 model.  One of them has leaked engine oil from the right front corner of the engine, (passenger side if it were a SxS)  Apparently something to do with the oil pump seal.  The other had electrical faults in the transmission and then wouldn't recognize the keys or start.  Good luck."
941170,Woodsman,2015-10-23 00:18:00,1286,Outlander L comes with a 5 year warrantry (big plus) and does not have a chiped key.
941186,Joeytier,2015-10-23 01:29:00,3990,Very nice bike.  I really like them as well.  You'll want to get some Mud lites in there asap!
941196,wallyboss,2015-10-23 02:14:00,1095,"Nice quad, but I agree with the mudlites!!!   Standard tires will get you stuck every time."
941202,Big Cliff,2015-10-23 03:17:00,6899,"Nice quad, but I agree with the mudlites!!!   Standard tires will get you stuck every time. So will mudlites cause you arent having fun until you can get it stuck LOL. Hope you got a winch with it, they sure are handy!"
941206,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 03:53:00,11391,"Congrats on your purchase! Hope it works out for ya(im sure it will)  But for ice fishing ill choose sled over wheeler any day(just my preference)  Get to the spot at 117, good way to wake up and fish hard?"
941208,Woodsman,2015-10-23 09:18:00,1286,Yes I ordered with a winch.
941213,G.mech,2015-10-23 11:44:00,830,"Nice quad, but I agree with the mudlites!!!   Standard tires will get you stuck every time.  I bought a set of mud lites for mine to use in the summer and then studded the crap out of the stock tires for ice fishing.  Good studs are amazing on ice but don't run them on your asphalt driveway...."
941240,Sinker,2015-10-23 13:57:00,8692,"Sleds are only good when there is snow on the ice. Down here there are a lot of times a sled is a no go. That said, there are times when there is too much snow for a quad.....ideally, you need both  Sleds are much faster though....for sure!!  S."
941248,mr blizzard,2015-10-23 14:30:00,1589,"ENJOY ,,,,nice purchase, winch and at some point tires,  I will pm u for a tip re ice trips"
941312,wallyboss,2015-10-23 17:07:00,1095,"I've heard from my quad mechanic that I should try something for better floatation for my quad in the snow and I tried it a few years ago.  Mudlites are installed in a certain direction( as per arrow on tire)  he told me to move the left side tires to the right side and vice versa. So instead of throwing out the mud from the sides like they should do,  it packs the snow under the tires if you reverse them. And take some air out of them.  I tried it and I find a difference. Anybody else tried it"

941364,mr blizzard,2015-10-23 22:09:00,1589,Tractor tire mentality makes total sense won't tell u about grinding logs down ? woods to late lol
941365,mr blizzard,2015-10-23 22:09:00,1589,Lugs not logs. Damn cell phone key pad lol

Anybody else tried it just taking some air out makes a big difference, but in testing snow tires, a/t ect in vehicles over the years found reversing tires had little to no effect on tire performance, mostly just a marketing stradegy i think"
