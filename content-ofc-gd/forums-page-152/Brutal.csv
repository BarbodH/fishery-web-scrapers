I reported a couple of guys a few years ago for taking OOS fish and over limit; they got nailed and they were back the very next day in the same place doing the exact same thing! We don't need more enforcement, we need tougher enforcement! Make it hurt if you do get caught, seize cars, trucks, equipment right on the spot none of this ""if you come to court and you can pay us then"" nonsense."

They do the best they can but their resources are so limited and if you think about it; on a population basis they are stretched so thin down here. Up in your neck of the woods if a guy gets caught everyone in the area knows him. Down here on any given day in crappy season there can be 50 or more boats in a small bay and there are hundreds of small bays. The odds of getting caught down here are about as good as the odds of winning the lottery and there lies the problem. Even if they do get caught and they don't show up in court, there is no one to hunt them down and make them accountable."

Salmon roe is very good when cured right for consumption. I have tried it done by a fella at work. He eats the whole fish though, not wasting it like that one in your pic.  I will not say the roe was taken for consumption, as you and I both know, there are slitters out there for the roe only for bait and the black market. Black market if caught selling as a retailer is a hefty fine from what I have heard."

I will cure and cold smoke it for you and you will be totally amazed at what you get back (no cost to you but I keep half for doing it).  I have been doing the cold smoke process for a couple of years now and you'll never buy any more from the store after you have tried mine.
