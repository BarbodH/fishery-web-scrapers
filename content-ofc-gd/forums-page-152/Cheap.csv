941615,spincast,2015-10-24 22:48:00,3279,"I remember back in the 80's when gas price wars were a common occurrence. One day the local newspaper in London had a photo of a gas tanker filling up at the pumps.  The cost was $0.10 / litre.  we're paying around $0.92 currently here. Kinda makes ya want to get a few thousand litres, some seafoam and park it in the back 40.  Looks like, according to some of the articles that are starting to circulate, that we have hit bottom, and the price is going to start inching up. Come May 2-4 next year, no doubt we'll see that ""driving season"" jump again"
