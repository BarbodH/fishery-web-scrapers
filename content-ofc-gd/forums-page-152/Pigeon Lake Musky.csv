237204,crappieperchhunter,2008-08-07 04:48:00,2582,I was gonna sneak over on the weekend for a visit and to check up on your completed Stone wall. Erika showed up with the little one so I never made it over. Once again good job on the Ski hunting. You guys are making it look easy. I will make it over another time to check your wall out.
237442,Doctrt,2008-08-07 22:17:00,141,Awesome day for that lake.  Everyone knows about the numbers but you guys may have set some records for size!

942014,Poolwrecker,2015-10-27 19:19:00,3,"Hey Guys, I'm new to the forum.  Thanks for some great info.  We went out to Pigeon last week (October 23).  As any reasonable fisherman, I won't say exactly where but we got 3 nice muskies.  I got a small (30 inches or so) one and the other two guys were each able to get one.  We had a 42"" and a 45"".  It was amazing to see those fish.  Nevery caught something like that before.  I see now why I bought that big net.  It was still not big enough for the 45"".  Anyways, wanted to say thanks for sharing your experiences and informaiton with me.  It made our day for the three of us."
942036,lew,2015-10-27 21:16:00,12766,Congrats on a successful day on Pigeon Poolwrecker and welcome to the board.
942091,captpierre,2015-10-28 01:12:00,2521,Incredible Well done!!
942096,Pigeontroller,2015-10-28 02:06:00,2793,"Welcome to OFC! If your going to target Muskie, a net that holds an even bigger fish (in the water) should be bought!"
942259,ehg,2015-10-28 23:21:00,2666,"I remember this post from 7 yrs.ago. Would see these guys trolling around out there but didn't know they were doing this well. Three 50 + inch musky. Blew me away! Too bad the photos are gone now.  I started trolling 12 inch Believers, Jake's, Grandmas, after seeing this. Caught musky but never over 48 in. These guys had it going on."
942343,Gregoire,2015-10-29 13:32:00,1397,Pigeon definitely has some Kawartha hogs.
236708,Meely,2008-08-05 22:53:00,282,"Hello Gang,  Headed up to Pigeon Lake again for the long weekend. Me and Buckster had dedicated Saturday to strictly fishing as there was a bunch of friends heading up to my place for the weekend.  After getting back from Bobcaygeon with groceries, we hit the lake around 11 am. The weather was a little odd in that it changed every half hour or so (sunny, cloudy, windy etc). Our goal was to do some musky-huntin' as we hadnt been out in a while. We fished for approximately 2 hours with not even a strike......Nadda.....Zippo......Zilch......Goose-Egg!    Then in the afternoon the weather turned overcast and the wind picked up causing a little chop on the water. Not more than 20 minutes into this new weather pattern......WHAMMO.......we get a fish !!  Here she is.....    For the next 3 hours we boated 4 more fish.  We could not believe how the fish just turned on with the new weather pattern. Just goes to show how vital weather and conditions can be.  Here is fish # 2, 3 and 5         Fish #4 came only 5 minutes after our 3rd fish. She hit a jointed believer and turned out to be our BIGGEST fish to date. She measured 52 inches and had a girth just shy of 22 inches. Her belly was incredibly big as she must have just gorged. We measured her, quick pic and away she went. We did not have a scale on board but using one of the fish-calculators she came off at just shy of 28 pounds. Our biggest in 11 years !!!  Here she is.....look at that gut.......the Muskies....not mine !!    Sunday we headed out to try our luck at pickerel. Managed a few small dinks then Buckster nailed this nice little gem.    In all it was a great weekend. We managed 5 skis and a decent pic.  Thanks for listening,  C'monnnnnnnn weeeknd !!  Meely"
236717,modny,2008-08-05 23:11:00,502,awesome report.  it really freaks me out when i know that i go swimming in pigeon and little and big bald lakes all the time.  i get chills everytime i fall in the water off my wakeboard. i'm afraid that i'm gonna get chomped.
236718,mattyk,2008-08-05 23:15:00,2110,"some great fish, that last musky is a beauty!"
236719,forrest,2008-08-05 23:15:00,1032,wow.  doesn't that lake have any small fish?
236721,solopaddler,2008-08-05 23:23:00,8605,"Incredible man, that's a big fish regardless of where you hunt musky."
236725,Beans,2008-08-05 23:36:00,3339,Do you think maybe the fishing Gods were watching the day you guys helped me reposition my dock...???  Good Karma and all that kind of stuff...  Thanks again guys and nice catches...You're on fire this year !!!
