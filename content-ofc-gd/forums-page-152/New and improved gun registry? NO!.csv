941557,Steve,2015-10-24 18:09:00,2075,"its not a high horse, we are a minority on this board.  we often sit and wonder how decisions get made, how governments get in with majority, etc, etc, etc.  I work with all walks of life, and see the big picture.  Very few on this board want to hear, or understand, how government decisions are made, but they are made to appease the majority of their constituents.  In the case of gun control, decisions made will not be considering the ""minority"" of this board, rather the majority of the country.  I'm able to put aside my personal feels when trying to understand decisions made by the government. However, reading many threads on this board, it is clear many are not.  Again, comparing a boat to a gun, for the purpose of the end result, death, is a weak comparison."
941564,manitoubass2,2015-10-24 18:17:00,11391," The government DOES NOT appeal to the vast majority.  It appeals to a corperate/goverment agenda.  Thats why we, as Canadians, DO NOT vote on laws passed, only parties at election time.  If what you were saying was indeed true, we would all vote on issues and laws being considered.  Instead, we are left to write letters/emails to are consituents showing our support or dismay of said legislature.  And again, it was a mere example. You got the point. So it WAS effective in conveying my point.  Perhaps I should have used compound bows instead??? Would that float your murderous boat???"
941567,Steve,2015-10-24 18:28:00,2075,"it would have been a better comparison than a murderous boat, lol  :)  when you are a minority, it feels like the government does not appeal to the vast majority.  but as the government, your entire existence is to appease the majority of your constituents...every decision they make is based on that principal.  we cannot vote on issues and laws being considered on an individual basis. No decision would ever get made if that was allowed. Instead we vote on a government that will make the decisions that we ""mostly"" will agree closely with. And the government will put into law rules that ""most"" of their constituents will agree with.  that is how the electoral system works....whether we agree with it, or not."

You keep repeating that the new government ""heads"" have been voted in by the ""majority"" and if they want to take away whatever, in this case guns then so be it.  Let me tell you, ALL government heads are in office to represent all the citizens not just those who voted for them. Are the citizens who did not vote for them now except to pay their taxes......of course not, because they too are expected to be represented by whom ever is now in office.  If what you keep repeating was true then the government heads that take office decide to run all minorities out of the country, so be it ? ? ?

941570,manitoubass2,2015-10-24 18:40:00,11391," That is the idea, yes. But it is not reality.  And you should know this(being in the field your in)  I've got my experience in a similar field(as we chatted briefly about)  In those fields, what matters?  It sure as heck isnt majorities or minorities.  Its corperatism(a real nice blend of socialism/fascism/democracy/marxism etc)  Whatever suites the need of the day.  Any country that wants guns, and any government that wants to take them away, is a fine blend of realizing political dissedence, and the people not truly believing in the governing body"
941572,Steve,2015-10-24 18:48:00,2075,"you are very correct. when dealing with private indu$try, majorities, minorities, etc don't play much at all into decision making.  in the private industry, money talks, all else walks. but with discussing governmental decisions, money is only a part of the decision making equation.  your final point, ""any country that wants guns"" --- you have to remember, as much as it kills you to read this, the majority of this country do not want guns without gun control ... heck I agree, guns should be allowed for hunting --- 100%. But the majority of this country want to feel safe...even if that means gun control.  MB, you are very correct in that dealing with governmental organizations and the decisions made by governments are done much differently than dealing with private industry, as the motivation is quite different.....but sometimes when dealing with governmental organizations, learning how to work with them, and not against them, will increase the chances of getting your intended results."
941576,manitoubass2,2015-10-24 18:53:00,11391,"It doesnt kill me to hear that.  The vast majority live in cities and have zero use of long guns, but its their utter ignorance that leads them from believing in our rights to legally obtain them.  They'de cry a different tune in the 1940's, that I promise.  The majority is corperate, and they tow the line nicely?"
941577,Steve,2015-10-24 18:57:00,2075,"but it isn't the 1940's.  and I'm not sure the majority this time is corporate....traditionally corporate is conservative.  EVERYONE who I worked with was voting harper...I believe I was the single liberal voter in our office.  This time the majority is the people who fought against corporate...because for the last 10 years we saw the results of corporate.  The people of Canada decided it was time for change....and in a majority manner. (truthfully, I wouldn't have bet a single dollar that JT was getting a majority...that really surprised me....and made me PROUD)"
941580,manitoubass2,2015-10-24 19:11:00,11391,"My point is that the newer age no longer understands, nor recognizes the importance.  Take 10 people from each major city hunting or fishing, and at least 8 of them have no idea what is happening.  I know, in my previous position Ive done this.  As a country and corperatism, we've STRETCHED our roots.  Half of Canada cant even start a fire without gas lol.  I mentioned the 40's because we had real values and skills then. My how times have changed.  Now most of us sit at a desk, we are just numbers, expected to create green numbers.  No skills(other then professional liars)  Thats the majority.  The minority is hard working folk, skilled in trades, experiences anglers, farmers, hunters etc  We dont sit in corperate seats at the bluejays game, but without us there is no economy and no Canada  We've bred weak, inept people incapable of logical thought, any real skills, any real work ethic.  This is the saddest generation our country has ever know.  We have rich and poor, little middle class.  We tow the line to the agendas to the money machine.  Even our banking system is corrupt as ....  Minority, majority, whatever.  Look at the world state and our place in NATO.  You'll wish we all had guns should tensions rise with Russia, or sanctions come from the US as we pull out of a war with the ragheaded british boogieman  End rant..."
941581,Steve,2015-10-24 19:19:00,2075,"That was a good, fair rant.  Just remember, the skills that may have been required in the 1940's don't necessarily translate to today's world.  Today's skills are not that of 1940's skills. Those who are successful today have a skill set different than that of a successful person in the 1940's.  Being able to start a fire in this day in age is not a skill.  I don't believe this is the saddest generation our country has ever come to know.  But I understand others may think that is the case.  Again, good rant"
941582,Beavertail,2015-10-24 19:24:00,331,"Am I missing something here? Are the gun crimes in this country so out of control to warrant drastic changes? I personally have never been involved in one, or know anyone who has. I feel very safe walking down the streets and living in my community. I tell you what though, I'm sure everyone knows at least one person who has been affected by a traffic accident, possibly caused by drinking and driving or just as bad now - texting. What about heart disease, obesity, smoking and how terrible our diets are these days with all the fast food available 24 hours a day. I know it's easy to single out gun control, and it gives some voters a false sense of security but people make so many poor choices DAILY that are a far greater risk to their lives than worrying about getting gunned down."

We are both opinionated - certainly. But I believe we are both civil.  Tell you what, I'll get on that next solar project being constructed in your area, and I'll order an inspection in which I will attend.

The LIberals tend to do better in cities where there are more corporations.  The Conservatives do better in more rural areas where there are fewer corporations.  When corporations were allowed to make political donations to the federal parties, the bulk of their donations were to the Liberals.  That is one of the reasons the Liberals had to adjust to the new donation rules; they no longer received corporate donations.  At the provincial level where corporations are still allowed to make donations; they donate mostly to the Liberals."

941786,Dara,2015-10-26 14:49:00,3052,"For the record here, all legal gun owners are registered.  To legally have a gun in your possesion you must have a firearms permit. To get this you must first take a safety course, then you must pass a test of competency. Then you must apply for a permit and attach professional references to the application. Your spouse if you have one must also sign this application saying that she is not intimidated or scared of you having a gun.  After this application is reviewed and approved you will recieve a permit to own long guns of a type approved by government.  Registration of firearms is the government also demanding that you supply a list of serial numbers of every gun you own. This is a very expensive proposition (3 billion dollar startup last time they tried it even though they claimed it would only be 1 million) The Police Cheifs association claims to like this registry but I don't know any actual police officers that care for it.  If you have a firearms permit the Police can automatically assume you have firearms. After all, you don't go through all the hassle and expense to get a permit to not have a gun.  There may be an argument to have a list of all serial numbers from the people that have permits, but in my opinion the cost outweighs the benefit.  Criminals do not have permits and they will not be registering any guns"

In order for it to have conveyed your point, a boat would have to be able to inflict the same amount of damage and death as the gun you are comparing it to.  Yes, a boat can kill....which is why I said I'll accept the comparison, but the way a boat kills vs the way a gun kills, which is completely opposite, is why the comparison is barely valid.  In a real debate, your comparison would have had no merit. (but hey, this is a fishing board.....)"

I know we don't all agree with all laws, but the idea of law is to follow it.

939216,Big Cliff,2015-10-12 17:16:00,6899,"This thread was about the CANADIAN election, and what party or parties might support or suppress private firearms ownership here.  It has gone sideways more often than it has gone forward, but so be it.  I was asked why the comments from JoePA might have offended me and yes I did conclude from his handle, his tone, and his comments that this person is an American person.  I may be wrong but I greatly doubt it.  And I most assuredly have American friends, most of whom are ardent NRA supporters, as I WOULD BE if lived in the USA.  That's not the point.  I do not like to be lectured and insulted by somebody that has no skin in the game and almost certainly has incomplete knowledge of the issue at hand, which I believe to be the case in JoePa's comments to which I did and do take offence.  In CANADA, we do not see mobs of people brandishing pitchforks and burning crosses, surging down city streets with their bedsheets wrapped on their heads, when they are unhappy about something.  In CANADA we generally use peaceful means to make our opposition known, including to actions of governments.  So, for example, when the government of Canada enacted Bill C-68, that is the modern firearms act, many unhappy Canadians wrote letters, button-holed their MPs, held peaceful rallies on Parliament Hill and elsewhere, challenged the legailty of the legislation, and eventually elected a government that repealed some of the more egregious aspects of C-68.  One of the main intervenors in the fight against C-68, which we took to the Supreme Court of Canada, was the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH).  In my opinion at the time, this organization was most aligned with my own views and so I decided to support the OFAH fight at the SCC level.  And at that time, I donated the largest personal donation that had ever up to that point been made to the OFAH, to continue that fight.  I am not a rich man but I put my money where my mouth was.  And yes for the nitpickers I did get a tax receipt so I recouped 20 or 30 percent of my donation at tax time.  I am not aware of any other individual who put a small fortune into the war chest.  So yes I resent being told I give up my freedoms too easily, or whatever poppycock it was that was written.  In CANADA we do things our way, and generally that does not involve blood in the streets.  We do NOT have a Second Amendment, we do NOT have the right to bear arms as a constitutional guarantee, and we almost always work within the law to achieve our aims.  In this election, as I have already stated, there is only one party that does not threaten private ownership of firearms as currently exists in Canadian Law, and that party, like them or hate them, is the Conservatives.

And some truly lunatic fringe stuff like billyboblunkerkiller that thinks more legislation will stop criminals from committing gun crimes.  But back to the topic at hand.....  I think most of us suffer from electile dysfunction, we are unable to get aroused about ANY party that is after our votes this time.  But as I said if we get back to the subject, and consider which (mainstream) party in this election does NOT want to restrict (or greatly restrict, or ban) ownership of firearms that are currently legal for licenced Canadians to possess, there is only one party.  It happens to be the Conservatives, who have a pile of excess baggage, WITHOUT QUESTION.  I do suspect that the Libertarian Party is pro-gun ownership, given their thesis that individuals should be responsible for their actions, and less government is good government.  I do not know if this is factual, but they have zero chance of forming a government or an opposition, and so I discount them as basically irrelevant to the outcome of the election.  If you are a one-main-issue voter, and your issue is the continuing personal ownership of firearms, drawing a penis on your ballot, on your head, whatever, is not helpful to your issue.  So if firearms ownership is IMPORTANT to you, then you have one choice.  Obviously, if this issue is NOT important to you, you have multiple choices, all of which may fail to arouse you and so drawing a penis, or not voting, may be your solution to this.  I do not support many of the actions of our existing government, and am truly angry about some.  But FOR ME, firearms are an important part of my life and heritage, and I wish to be able to continue to hunt, and shoot targets, and so I am going to hold my nose and vote for the only party that does not wish to rob me of that.

You guys live in one of the most violent countries on earth and hardly a day goes by we don't hear on the news up here about another mass shooting.  You've murdered several of your presidents and shot a few others, you murdered Bobby Kennedy after you killed his brother, you shot George Wallace and murdered Martin Luther King.  You have wackos constantly killing kids in schools, in movie theaters and walking down the street. Just last week they caught someone in Arizona trying to kill people driving down the roads. You had those cowards blow up the building years ago in Oklahoma and killed about 160 people.  Several innocent people were murdered and a whole bunch more badly injured when one of your countrymen set off a bomb at the Boston Marathon.  There was an army major awhile back shot a bunch of soldiers on an army base.  Jeez, you guys even murdered John Lennon  You said yourself earlier you even have a gun with you when you go fishing. If I was that afraid of my fellow Americans I'd give up fishing.  I could go on and on about the insane murder rate you guys have down there but I guess I've made my point.  I've got a bunch of very good friends from the States and I'm not trying to single anyone out, but as I said above, there's nothing worse than listening to people like you criticize the gun laws in Canada.  And just for comparison, Toronto has close to 3 million people yet the murder rate is somewhere around 60 people per year.  Can you name one  large city in the States that's even close to only 60 murders a year ??  Maybe worry about your own gun rules before you complain about ours."

You are certainly entitled to your opinions but I take offence at your broad-brush comments.  I doubt VERY MUCH that you understand our history of private firearms ownership in this country, nor our political history with which that is intertwined.

937241,akaShag,2015-09-29 23:17:00,2073,"This thread was about the CANADIAN election, and what party or parties might support or suppress private firearms ownership here.  It has gone sideways more often than it has gone forward, but so be it.  I was asked why the comments from JoePA might have offended me and yes I did conclude from his handle, his tone, and his comments that this person is an American person.  I may be wrong but I greatly doubt it.  And I most assuredly have American friends, most of whom are ardent NRA supporters, as I WOULD BE if lived in the USA.  That's not the point.  I do not like to be lectured and insulted by somebody that has no skin in the game and almost certainly has incomplete knowledge of the issue at hand, which I believe to be the case in JoePa's comments to which I did and do take offence.  In CANADA, we do not see mobs of people brandishing pitchforks and burning crosses, surging down city streets with their bedsheets wrapped on their heads, when they are unhappy about something.  In CANADA we generally use peaceful means to make our opposition known, including to actions of governments.  So, for example, when the government of Canada enacted Bill C-68, that is the modern firearms act, many unhappy Canadians wrote letters, button-holed their MPs, held peaceful rallies on Parliament Hill and elsewhere, challenged the legailty of the legislation, and eventually elected a government that repealed some of the more egregious aspects of C-68.  One of the main intervenors in the fight against C-68, which we took to the Supreme Court of Canada, was the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH).  In my opinion at the time, this organization was most aligned with my own views and so I decided to support the OFAH fight at the SCC level.  And at that time, I donated the largest personal donation that had ever up to that point been made to the OFAH, to continue that fight.  I am not a rich man but I put my money where my mouth was.  And yes for the nitpickers I did get a tax receipt so I recouped 20 or 30 percent of my donation at tax time.  I am not aware of any other individual who put a small fortune into the war chest.  So yes I resent being told I give up my freedoms too easily, or whatever poppycock it was that was written.  In CANADA we do things our way, and generally that does not involve blood in the streets.  We do NOT have a Second Amendment, we do NOT have the right to bear arms as a constitutional guarantee, and we almost always work within the law to achieve our aims.  In this election, as I have already stated, there is only one party that does not threaten private ownership of firearms as currently exists in Canadian Law, and that party, like them or hate them, is the Conservatives.  'Nuff said.  Flame away.  Doug"

936373,Mister G,2015-09-24 23:47:00,1429,"An FAC, or PAL as it became, was your registration to allow you to buy or have a gun. It cost you money and you have to fill in lots of forms to get one.  There is a record of you getting it.  I ask you, why would anybody go through all that to NOT get a gun  Stands to reason anybody with a PAL HAS a gun.  What good would it do the police to know the serial number before they come to arrest you  The criminal still won't have a PAL  Its only the so called Liberal govt that has to know every thing about you and run your life  Fear a government that fears your guns   FEAR a government that doesn't fear you."
936374,Mister G,2015-09-24 23:53:00,1429,"Right on Big Cliff.  Canada to USA is apples to oranges. But let's look at the other day when a murderer was on the loose near Ottawa. People where told to stay in there house. Maybe a good time to dust off what you have to protect your family. I have relatives that live in Boston, Mass and during the time when the two Russian terrorist were running a muck in the area most people locked their doors and fear the night and day. Not my relative because they were Lock and Loaded to protect their families as they should.  This is why we should never surrender our right to guns. Protecting the family and ranch should always be a right and never just a privilege to only some higher up citizens."
936375,Mister G,2015-09-24 23:55:00,1429," FL is one state that allows carry as well as Texas, Alaska and others. There are a lot of violent acts all across the US. Alaska has more murders than Ontario does in a year with less than 700,000 people. Having said that, the most violent place in the US is Chicago and they don't allow carry (open or concealed). To me it seems that the problem exists with the US' way of dealing with background checks. The reason I believe you see much less gun violence in Canada is because of our laws regarding training and the PAL. I would think if the US would introduce mandatory training and an acquisition type license there would be far fewer issues.  As it is you go into a gun shop and fill out the paperwork and a week later you come and pick up your gun. Minor BG check and no firearms training needed. The US has all those laws and training as you mentioned but they are not advertised by the Liberal government administration for political reasons."

936493,Dutch01,2015-09-25 15:53:00,1431,"  Why the Gun is Civilization   Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories, without exception. Reason or force, thats it.  In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.  When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.  There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that wed be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the muggers potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiatit has no validity when most of a muggers potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and thats the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.  Then theres the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones dont constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon thats as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldnt work as well as a force equalizer if it wasnt both lethal and easily employable.  When I carry a gun, I dont do so because I am looking for a fight, but because Im looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I dont carry it because Im afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesnt limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equationand thats why carrying a gun is a civilized act.    I believe my right to self defense is not granted by the government, rather it is absolute and inalienable.  I do not and will not accept the government trying to remove this right. In the end, that may mean I have to be tried by twelve, but at least I won't be being carried by six.  That's my $0.02"

Sold a family member a car that I never did get paid for, I watched that car drive around town for 4 years after the transfer.  The only thing that bothered me about any of it was that some of the items were things that friends had given me, and that hurt! Thing was, after the tackle box disapeared so many of my friends came to my rescue that I ended up having to buy a bigger tackle box. That box now houses many favorite memories again, some I never use, I just like looking at them and remembering where they came from, some have become my new favorite goto items. True the old items are still gone but I am getting old and there is only so much room in my head for memories .

If I have it and you want it, all you have to do is ask (within reason LOL wife and kids not available). Is money important? Sure but it isn't everything and no amount of money is worth risking your or a loved ones life over.  For those that think a knife, baseball bat, golf club, or even a gun is a good defence, I just hope you never run into some drug crazed idiot that brought a gun to your fight because while you are thinking of what to do, the second they see any kind of resistance they will do their best to kill you!  Short of harming your family or taking your life, if you have it and they want it, give it to them! Then call the cops and/or get even!"

936249,Mister G,2015-09-24 15:11:00,1429," YES the Libs spent 2 Billion dollars and in the end the program was scrapped by the Cons who really wasted the money LOL... No question, though it was problematic and didn't work programs that are all stick and no carrot seldom do.  Now, If some of the money spent wastefully, went to people who fed their kids, put gas in their in the car at the local station, bought groceries, grabbed a hamburger at a restaurant I was cooking at and eventually paid their taxes is that really more or less wasteful than any other government spending?  If however it went into a corporate bank account in the Caymans then that somebody should be shot by each and every gun that was registered twice LOL  I personally have 2 family members who were PROUD of the fact that they had them ""crats"" going around in circles trying to register up their guns.... They mislead, misfiled and generally did everything they could do to make the process more difficult that it needed to be. Then they would have a wobbly pop or 6 and moan and complain about the high cost, of the program,..... You can't make this stuff up.... and NO we don't talk anymore.  The only 2 problems I had with the gun registry were very simple. Other than I never heard of a criminal sitting down to register a gun before they headed out on a crime spree. I did see the logic in enabling police to know if possible if there were guns in a home during a crisis too, though.  1) My first problem when I heard it about the NEW registry was.... When I bought my guns I had an FAC and I filled out the forms at the store to buy them. WHAT did I do that for if that paper NEVER went anywhere, the kid at Canadian Tire that watched me fill out the forms seemed so on the ball at the time? 2) If they wanted the guns registered that is great but stop with the stick and give out some carrot.... They should have PAID for it by giving the person they wanted to ""voluntarily"" register the guns, a same as CASH 20.00 tax credit for each gun and have the info sent in with their taxes.... Better compliance would have resulted and the CRA already had a friggin computer network that could HOLD the data and it is semi secure sorta LOL.  The only penalty if you didn't register and for whatever reason got caught with guns and or not properly stored guns but committed no other ""offense"" tack an extra 500.00 for each gun onto their taxes. CRA gets their money from honest folks so it would work. Also of course confiscate them and after 2 yrs let them buy them some other persons guns at auction if they want. Don't turn them into a ""criminal"" save the jail space and court time, hit them where it hurts honest people the most in the pocket book...  However, if you got caught with an illegal handgun or unregistered or stolen registered gun in the commission of a crime. Oops your bad and the next 10 yrs of your life are going to involve some very tense shower times, no time off, no early parole you did the crime you DO the time. Spoken like a  true Liberal"

FL is one state that allows carry as well as Texas, Alaska and others. There are a lot of violent acts all across the US. Alaska has more murders than Ontario does in a year with less than 700,000 people. Having said that, the most violent place in the US is Chicago and they don't allow carry (open or concealed). To me it seems that the problem exists with the US' way of dealing with background checks. The reason I believe you see much less gun violence in Canada is because of our laws regarding training and the PAL. I would think if the US would introduce mandatory training and an acquisition type license there would be far fewer issues.  As it is you go into a gun shop and fill out the paperwork and a week later you come and pick up your gun. Minor BG check and no firearms training needed."

After off the phone with 911 the police called and i was informed ""i could remove the intruder from my house and property by any means necessary. Dont kill them unless you feel you have to""  Well the intruder was drunk and i couldnt see a weapon but I had 5 kids in the house and said person was trying to grab my daughter.  I opted baseball bat instead of shotgun in that situation.  Well i also powerbombed him off my deck and restrained him no so comfortably for 30 minutes till the police arrived.  Upon arrival the police said I made a good call but did have the right to shoot if I chose. He said especially since the intruder touched my daughter i had every right to fire.  Anyhow, its kinda weird and seems to go almost on the judgement of the officer(s).  Im not even sure what the EXACT laws are for protecting your house and property??? Protecting my house and property is one thing, touch my daughter and they would never found his body!"

Eenie meenie miney mo!!!!!  YES the Libs spent 2 Billion dollars and in the end the program was scrapped by the Cons who really wasted the money LOL... No question, though it was problematic and didn't work programs that are all stick and no carrot seldom do.  Now, If some of the money spent wastefully, went to people who fed their kids, put gas in their in the car at the local station, bought groceries, grabbed a hamburger at a restaurant I was cooking at and eventually paid their taxes is that really more or less wasteful than any other government spending?  If however it went into a corporate bank account in the Caymans then that somebody should be shot by each and every gun that was registered twice LOL  I personally have 2 family members who were PROUD of the fact that they had them ""crats"" going around in circles trying to register up their guns.... They mislead, misfiled and generally did everything they could do to make the process more difficult that it needed to be. Then they would have a wobbly pop or 6 and moan and complain about the high cost, of the program,..... You can't make this stuff up.... and NO we don't talk anymore.  The only 2 problems I had with the gun registry were very simple. Other than I never heard of a criminal sitting down to register a gun before they headed out on a crime spree. I did see the logic in enabling police to know if possible if there were guns in a home during a crisis too, though.  1) My first problem when I heard it about the NEW registry was.... When I bought my guns I had an FAC and I filled out the forms at the store to buy them. WHAT did I do that for if that paper NEVER went anywhere, the kid at Canadian Tire that watched me fill out the forms seemed so on the ball at the time? 2) If they wanted the guns registered that is great but stop with the stick and give out some carrot.... They should have PAID for it by giving the person they wanted to ""voluntarily"" register the guns, a same as CASH 20.00 tax credit for each gun and have the info sent in with their taxes.... Better compliance would have resulted and the CRA already had a friggin computer network that could HOLD the data and it is semi secure sorta LOL.  The only penalty if you didn't register and for whatever reason got caught with guns and or not properly stored guns but committed no other ""offense"" tack an extra 500.00 for each gun onto their taxes. CRA gets their money from honest folks so it would work. Also of course confiscate them and after 2 yrs let them buy them some other persons guns at auction if they want. Don't turn them into a ""criminal"" save the jail space and court time, hit them where it hurts honest people the most in the pocket book...  However, if you got caught with an illegal handgun or unregistered or stolen registered gun in the commission of a crime. Oops your bad and the next 10 yrs of your life are going to involve some very tense shower times, no time off, no early parole you did the crime you DO the time."
