I know some of these local lakes are heavily fished in the summer. Any recommendations for the more isolated lakes for lakers and or big bass? Thanks, M.T."
940978,irishfield,2015-10-22 01:09:00,26272,"I've only fished Birch Lake over there.. not a lot of traffic, was BIG bass and Pickeral but that was about 15 years ago."
941000,Joeytier,2015-10-22 01:44:00,3990,"Congrats on your purchase.  I used to camp on Crotch lake lots when I was younger, beautiful lake that was never too busy, but is now starting to get pretty crazy by the sounds of things (just like every other lake with crownland sites within 3 hrs of GTA).  I remember checking fish online not long ago in that area, and there are plenty of quiet looking areas with small bass and stocked trout lakes close to Plevna/Cloyne area.  Hopefully you'll have enough time to do some exploring yourself."
