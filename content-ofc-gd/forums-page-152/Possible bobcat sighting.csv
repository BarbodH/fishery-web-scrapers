941801,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 15:55:00,11391,Yes they are cougars
941803,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 15:58:00,11391,"Ive seen 3 personally but never enough time to take a pic  Its getting gnarly around here.  Massive amounts of deer, huge increase in wolf populations and now more and more cougars, all lookin for those grain fed deer."
941821,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 17:12:00,11391,Turns out that pic is unreliable.  Apperently taken in saskatchewan
941822,Dutch01,2015-10-26 17:15:00,1431,That makes more sense. MNR is saying they won't even look at cougar pics unless there is a definable landmark to place it's location....
941831,John Bacon,2015-10-26 17:52:00,3277,"Not my image, but this was posted on fb not too far from our house    Are you near Innisfil?  I saw the picture on FaceBook; the poster claimed that it was off Highway 11 near Innisfil."
941834,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 17:57:00,11391,No im not  Pic must be making its rounds like that record pike pic years ago???
941867,lew,2015-10-26 20:32:00,12766,Pic must be making its rounds like that record pike pic years ago  You talkin about this pike from Scugog Rick ??  
941875,Blue Lk,2015-10-26 22:14:00,337,Not a Bobcat but I spotted this Lynx in the back driveway 1 winter.
941883,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 22:38:00,11391,Yeah thats the one Lew! But from Rainy Lake(same angler though)???
941971,Rod Caster,2015-10-27 13:48:00,5784,Great Lynx shot BlueLK! I really hope I see one this winter!
940512,Dutch01,2015-10-19 16:12:00,1431,"Driving home from my favorite Kawartha lake late last night (around 100am) when a very, very large cat ran across the road in front of my truck. This was east of Beaverton.  I see coyotes and bears up there all the time and I KNOW it wasn't one of those.. I don't think it was large enough to be a cougar, and it didn't have a long enough tail.  Had anyone ever seen a lynx or bobcat this far south before?"
940520,chris.brock,2015-10-19 16:41:00,4053," From talking to trappers in Haliburton, I know there isn't any Lynx there so I suspect none down there either."
940522,Shloim,2015-10-19 16:44:00,515,Theres trappers in Haliburton? I had no idea
940525,Sinker,2015-10-19 17:03:00,8692,"Bobcat would have a short tail, no?  Ive seen what I truly believe to be a couger around my area.  S."
940526,Beavertail,2015-10-19 17:04:00,331,"There are trappers all over Ontario, some much further south than that. I know some in the KW area. Mostly Muskrat, Beaver and Mink down here though."
940527,hunteronwheels,2015-10-19 17:14:00,112,actually bobcats are southern cats they are just slowly moving north they dont do well in really deep snow you will see more of them in southern ontario
940528,Beavertail,2015-10-19 17:16:00,331,"Bobcat's (and Lynx) have a short tail...imagine a dog with a docked tail like a Pointer. Cougars are long, like on a house cat...a 200lb house cat."
940529,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-19 17:21:00,10439,I got this picture of a bobcat in it's natural environment recently!! It was a very rare sighting for sure!!!!  
940530,Dutch01,2015-10-19 17:29:00,1431,Wouldn't want to hit one of those with my truck!  I wish I got a better look at this thing. I'm sure it was a big cat.....
940535,John Bacon,2015-10-19 18:19:00,3277,Bobcat's range extends south to Florida and Mexico.  Southern Ontario would be the northern extent of their range.  It would also be near the southern limit of the range for lynx.  I think a bobcat would be more likely than lynx in that area.  But both are possible.
940537,Sinker,2015-10-19 18:48:00,8692,"Yes, but neither of them have that long tail. Once you see that tail, you know its a cat. There is no other creature with a tail like that.  S."
940540,John Bacon,2015-10-19 18:57:00,3277,"Yes, but neither of them have that long tail. Once you see that tail, you know its a cat. There is no other creature with a tail like that.  S.  The OP said that it didn't have a long enough tail to be a cougar.  So (depending on exactly how short the tail was), a lynx or bobcat would make sense."
940547,Dutch01,2015-10-19 19:15:00,1431, I really thought bobcat or lynx right away but wasn't sure they can be seen around here...
940549,BillM,2015-10-19 19:22:00,17367,I think Dutchie saw an Atlantic...  Extremely rare around these parts!
940551,misfish,2015-10-19 19:28:00,29133,They have been sighted in Inisfill. Not big numbers.
940646,DanD,2015-10-20 11:08:00,2223,"About 10 or 12 years ago while driving out of our trailer park; my son and I saw a bobcat in the woods on the side of the driveway. We stopped the truck and sat there for at least 10 minutes; the whole time the cat didn't move, it was like staring at a statue. Then it crouched the slightest bit and then jumped out of the small clearing and was gone. The park is just outside of Normandale (down by Turkey Point), which is about 15klm South of Delhi. So yea these cats are around and after my ten minute encounter, I can understand why and how they are not spotted very often; It just disappeared not making a sound.  Dan."

940667,Thrilla,2015-10-20 14:34:00,164,Theres trappers in Haliburton? I had no idea  Where have you been lol
940670,Rod Caster,2015-10-20 14:45:00,5784,"Here is a bobcat I captured on Cam this summer. I live near North Bay  Last fall, while in a tree stand I saw one (I like to think the same one) stalk and attack two fawns. It was incredible and hilarious.  Bobcats are smaller and darker in colour than a Lynx  "
940675,Beavertail,2015-10-20 15:02:00,331,"Cool pic of the bobcat, you have a nice assortment of critters in your neck of the woods! What was the outcome with the fawns?"
940685,Rod Caster,2015-10-20 16:31:00,5784,"The bobcat completely fumbled it. He took 15 minutes to move 5 feet, then lunged at one of the fawns facing it. The first deer ran off immediately so the bobcat paused while the second deer looked at the feeling first fawn. The bobcat realized the second one was staying still, but he double clutched it and the second one eventually got wise and ran off. After the two deer escaped, ol' bobby plunged into the forest after them and that was the last I saw. Haha"
940687,Beavertail,2015-10-20 16:59:00,331,"Thats amazing you got to witness that in person, those predator/prey encounters are such a rare treat. Thanks for sharing!"
