941200,Roy,2015-10-23 03:01:00,13728,"Not at all for a handmade quality bait.  I can appreciate the work that goes into building home made baits but, from my perspective, $120 US is too much for what essentially is a jake knock off."
941207,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 03:55:00,11391,I feel the same about japanese cranks?
941246,Steve,2015-10-23 14:22:00,2075,"mb2, japanese cranks most often use quality split rings and hooks...  the north american lures use the cheapest hooks and split rings available."
941272,mike rousseau,2015-10-23 15:39:00,4661,"I've never had any musky lure fail... I can buy 6 10""jakes for that price... Or 3 14""...  If it's a lure design that is unique of hard to duplicate then no problem forking over $100...  I just don't understand why some wood baits are $50 and others are $150... Or 8"" is $45 and 10"" is $70... Lol... Same amount of work to make an 8"" as a 10""... Just an extra 2"" of wood"
941310,Roy,2015-10-23 16:58:00,13728," ... Just an extra 2"" of wood  Nah, I won't go there. It's too  easy."
941401,mike rousseau,2015-10-24 00:24:00,4661,Lmao!!!  I set you up so well
941523,Pigeontroller,2015-10-24 16:20:00,2793,"HoseBaits, look them up on Facebook.  Best built Muskie Cranks period."
941613,irishfield,2015-10-24 22:39:00,26272,"If they catch squat they are overpriced. If they catch a giant they are priceless.  I chuckled at Andy on Tuesday when I threw a Plow on to run at 30' and he said ""that's gonna cost you $150 on the next hump""!"

940173,mike rousseau,2015-10-17 18:28:00,4661,"Hey everyone..  Looking for a few large (over 10"") trolling baits for musky...  And more importantly where can I get them?  Id LOVE to find a larger version of a ""drifter stalker"" or Wiley looking lure...  Also considering a 14"" Jake... The 13"" grandmas didn't work for me but 10"" Jakes do good here so maybe the 14"" Jake will work...  I'd also love to know what works for you personally... Nice to steal a bit of your confidence when your looking at lures $50-$150 each! Lol  Thanks  Mike"
940178,Steve,2015-10-17 18:42:00,2075,"I own a wishmaster muskie lure that I won many years back.....  but these things are so nice, it's tough to put them in the water.... I trolled in on Erie once, near the mouth of the Niagara River, where the bottom was pretty uniform."
940179,lew,2015-10-17 18:43:00,12766,"I did well with a 13"" jointed Believer in Walleye color Mike, but don't know how it would work out your way.  Other than that bait I didn't use too many of the bigger trolling lures and seldom went bigger than 10"""
940206,mike rousseau,2015-10-17 19:23:00,4661,Talk about a lure that's no longer made and cost a fortune...  Rub it in why don't ya... Lol

940220,mike rousseau,2015-10-17 20:08:00,4661,Do you use these and have success with these? Like look really cheaply made IMO
940237,OhioFisherman,2015-10-17 20:53:00,6623,Have you tried looking at what is available on ebay?  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Muskalunch-Giant-Wood-Musky-Lure-/141800139539?hash=item2103f26b13:g:rJwAAOSw~bFWGDyR  You might need a big motor to troll that one!
940261,mike rousseau,2015-10-17 22:11:00,4661,Lol  2 feet long!  eBay is tricky without names of lures to search...  That's what I'm looking for... Lure names
940291,MuskieWannabe,2015-10-18 00:10:00,79,"I order a couple 14"" Jakes from Rollie's before, maybe $50 each all in with shipping. I even bust them out the odd time in the summer and have had success."

You might ask some of the muskie guys for their top picks before spending tons of cash?
940318,Fishboch,2015-10-18 03:18:00,9,Protackle has some big baits but the biggest I found come from JB Baits. Unfortunately they have no rwebsite.
940449,Rich Nelson,2015-10-18 22:40:00,332,"Blue Water baits, Hose baits, Bretts Baits, Wick Onez. All built like tanks, and catch a lot of big fish."
940451,muskymatt,2015-10-18 22:47:00,2608,Legend plows have worked extremely well for me
940465,cram,2015-10-19 01:31:00,1733,Hose Baits Fatty is a giant version of the stalker. Really well made baits.  Super nice guy too.
940484,mike rousseau,2015-10-19 13:31:00,4661,Thanks  I'll look into these
940486,mike rousseau,2015-10-19 13:32:00,4661,"I thought they were a 9"" bait...  So shorter then a stalker but fatter"
940510,cram,2015-10-19 15:57:00,1733,"I thought they were a 9"" bait...  So shorter then a stalker but fatter Could be.  Thought he had longer versions.  Maybe I'm mixing up the name.  Or the size. "
940569,F7Firecat,2015-10-19 21:10:00,347,zingers!
940936,houski,2015-10-21 22:32:00,61,"I love trolling big baits. Definitely not only just for fall. They're deadly in the summer too. My top 3 bigs are:  Plow: they get down there with minimal line out, they're durable (I like crashing bottom with them), they hook dirty, and fish love em  14"" Jake: wide wobble, especially good for late fall speeds, get the ones with the ball bearing rattles.  13"" Believer Straight : nothing swims like a believer, giant belly roll and wide wobble, plus you can really get them down, they almost never hang up, and when they do,  open the bail and they back out of trouble"
941059,Gregoire,2015-10-22 12:50:00,1397,Look up Northshore Musky Baits on Facebook and send him a PM. John Mortimer is a great guys and will be able to get you on the right track. This time of year it can be tough to find the popular baits as many of them are sold out.
941063,mike rousseau,2015-10-22 13:27:00,4661,"Found a 10"" hooker used for $55 CAN shipped last night... These baits have a nice large profile... So I bought it to try...  Also found a wick onez bait but oh man they're pricey for basically a fancy Jake..  I'm really leaning towards a 14"" Jake because I love the 10"" jake and have caught a lot of fish on them...  Biggest issue with these larger bait it's picking a color... I don't want 5x 14"" Jakes... Lol  Thanks for all the input so far everyone... At least I have some names to keep an eye out for"
941078,Roy,2015-10-22 14:57:00,13728,"Also found a wick onez bait but oh man they're pricey for basically a fancy Jake..   Yeah, I saw that one go by yesterday as well, Mike. The price is definitely out of whack."
941082,Raf,2015-10-22 15:30:00,3495,"the big hookers are proven fish catchers  as mentioned, hard to go wrong with 14"" jakes, 13"" grandmas and the big believers in the 'mass produced' segment of muskie baits.  for the expensive 'customs' you're paying extra for a bait that will last you a lot longer than the above mass produced deals."
