940070,lew,2015-10-17 09:42:00,12766,"I use stainless cable & crimps from Home Depot  to put it together with a bit of shrink wrap to make it neat.    Loop it around the reel seat then attach the reel to the rod & your good to go.    I use the same cable for the tether with brass clips, just loop the cable through the clip, put on the shrink wrap & crimp it together.    Same idea for the end you clip to the boat.      Been using this set-up for a long time and have never had any issues at all with it.  Not saying it's the only way or even the best way but it works good for me."

940075,lew,2015-10-17 11:48:00,12766,"That's perfect Lew ..quick and easy ,Thanks  Your more than welcome.  Forgot to add I make mine 4' long and that works good for me and makes it easy to unclip when you get a fish, but  everybody will have their own preference as to length."

940082,Sinker,2015-10-17 12:51:00,8692,Ever had a rod pull out? Mine have never budged....i use the down easters as well. Now you have me paranoid. Lol   Ive caught tons of salmon on those rod holders and never had a rod move though....  S.

940090,lew,2015-10-17 13:44:00,12766,Ever had a rod pull out? Mine have never budged..  I've never lost anything either Shane but do know a couple guys who have had expensive rigs go over the side. The tether doesn't interfere with anything and only takes a second to unclip when a fish hits.
940164,mike rousseau,2015-10-17 18:00:00,4661,My trolling combos float...  Also every trolling crank I have ever seen floats...  Before you bother with a leash put your trolling combo in the water and see if it floats... Of it does it's kinda pointless to have leashes...  I had a set of leashes and they were more trouble then useful...
940219,captpierre,2015-10-17 20:03:00,2521,Never thought of tethering. Got me thinking now. I use Orcas
940235,Sinker,2015-10-17 20:47:00,8692,I would think the tether would get in the way as well. Imagine hooking the new wirld record and the tether causes you to lose it? Id rather lose the rod and not know haha
940267,Rizzo,2015-10-17 22:28:00,4754,Some of those floating set ups only float for 20 seconds or so. ..found that the hard way
940285,lew,2015-10-17 23:45:00,12766,"I would think the tether would get in the way as well.  Not in the least Shane, I've caught a ton of muskies while the rod is tethered  and never once did it get in the way.  Soon as the fish hits you lift the rod out of the holder and with one hand simply unclip it and lay it down in an out of the way spot and your all set.  It's all a personal choice though and if you like the tether their great, but if you'd rather not use one that's good too."
940554,esoxansteel,2015-10-19 19:38:00,1307,"Trojan tackle makes great tethers, I tether my trolling outfits, my knipex pliers and all release tools, and Frabill BK net as well,  as they don't work when there on the bottom of the lake, as Lew says 4 foot is fine, and just unclip them takes all of one second and there out of the way"
941171,tomkat,2015-10-23 00:20:00,246,Almost lost my st croix legend tournament sling blade with shimano Calcutta trolling in chop. The rod tip gets bumped up by the water and it popped out of the salty but I grabbed it in time. Could have been an expensive lesson.
941175,irishfield,2015-10-23 00:31:00,26272,"You need to pull bigger baits tomkat... Monday we trolled for 8 hours, rod tips IN the water in 5 to 7 foot swells. Not a chance they were going to pop on their own. That said I know of them being popped by guys bumping the rod butt."
941253,tomkat,2015-10-23 14:48:00,246,That makes sense I think I had a spinner bait on in maybe 3 foot swells. I can't imagine my boat in 5-7 foot swells I wouldn't even go out. All the same I think I will go see Dave for some Trojan Tackle lanyards.
