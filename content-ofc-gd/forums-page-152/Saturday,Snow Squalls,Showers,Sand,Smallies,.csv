940754,Whitespinnerbait,2015-10-20 23:22:00,2038,Hi All With the forecast calling for cold temps and the chance of snow squalls...We were a little skeptical of heading out for some fall smallies. Arriving at the launch=snow squall    Quite the mixture of weather unfolded through out the day.    As the went on the bite started to pick up nicely.    Days end....

Snow squalls and all   Congrats to the both of you's  Don't know why this report isn't getting the attention it should get.... both these anglers are not pros but the most dedicated bass anglers I've ever known!!!  I know cause I get to fish with both of them from time to time and land some beauties   Like this one, a 4lbs 9oz smallie  "
941733,lew,2015-10-25 22:37:00,12766,  Don't know why this report isn't getting the attention it should get  Why is this report more deserving of attention than any other report ?
941734,Leecher,2015-10-25 22:42:00,7832, Why is this report more deserving of attention than any other report ?  Cause I guess I peaked your attention and you are responding.... these guys are true die hard bass addicts just like you muskie fishing...
941735,lew,2015-10-25 22:44:00,12766, these guys are true die hard bass addicts just like you muskie fishing...  But I don't whine if my reports don't get a lot of attention.
941738,Leecher,2015-10-25 22:58:00,7832," But I don't whine if my reports don't get a lot of attention.  Who says I'm whining???  and don't want to get into a scuff... I was expressing my thoughts on a report that should, in my mind, get recognition for the accomplishment these guys put the most effort into it this time of year and sharing this report..."
941751,mikeh,2015-10-26 03:02:00,824,"always enjoy your fishing reports, you guys sure have some great fishing spots out that way. Looks like fishing 24/7 caught all the fish .  Most guys were probably saying it was going to snow and stayed home, you guys are dedicated fishermen . congrats"
941754,fishindevil,2015-10-26 08:32:00,6254,Wow !!!! Some very fat fall brown tanks !!!!!!! Awesome ....
