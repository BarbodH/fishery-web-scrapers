942575,Sinker,2015-10-30 17:27:00,8692,Mine gets washed when it rains. Sometimes when I shovel the snow out I get some dirt too. Lol  S.

930755,captpierre,2015-08-22 14:16:00,2521,So finally got to clean the boat. Have a black Lund. Lots of spots and dull. Used CLR To get the spots/calcium off. Needed a fair bit of contact time with repeated wiping. Looks like new. Wondering if waxing or something else will keep it that way I have car Turtlewax that I use for the motor. Anybody know what's best?
930757,porkpie,2015-08-22 14:28:00,2521,"I've never waxed my boat, but my buddy swears by it, and his rig always looks sharp.  I think he just uses whatever he puts on the truck!"
930758,Parnelly,2015-08-22 14:37:00,108,"Mothers brazillian wax is a great product. Used to use turtle wax once upon a time. After using mothers, ill never go back to Turtle. Much better product that lasts much longer than turtle wax.  Also used to use armor all tire shine, until I tried the maguires. Wont be going back to armor all. New trailer tires sure do stay nice looking with that stuff."
930836,musky666,2015-08-23 12:53:00,126,"I am a big fan of the RV wax from CTC, used to say it contained Teflon, but had to change that up so now its another thing- like contains PTEF or something. Goes on nice although it may need two coats if surface is oxidized some. Lasts for multiple years and dirt slides off when it rains- love it, brand is Star-Brite I think."
930843,jtracc,2015-08-23 13:39:00,97,"Lucas slick mist. Amazing, fast and very easy to apply.  Used it on my glass bass boat when I had one and works just as good on my crestliner."

930853,leaf4,2015-08-23 14:57:00,2466,"Auto glym is top notch, their ultra deep shine is made for black paint, available at CT its an excellent product that many detailers I know use (I also used it when I worked as a detailer at Budds BMW)"
930858,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-23 15:22:00,8243,"For both glass and aluminum get a bottle of McGuire's de-oxidizer liquid , blue bottle. No need to wax and the finish will come up to a brilliant sheen. A small amount is all you need. I did an entire 28 foot cruiser with only 1/2 bottle, the other 1/2 did a 23 foot Cuddy with some still left. 20 bucks a bottle. Great stuff.  Follow the instructions. I use a power buffer for putting it on then hand remove and then polish it with the buffer. 4 10"" buffer pads at Princess Auto $7.99."
930904,fishindevil,2015-08-23 20:26:00,6254,I have used several if the products mentioned above on my boat as well and the mothers products are hard to beat 2 times a year I do mine with a small electric hand buffer and it last a long time and works great !!! Thumbs up for mothers .... But to just wash it I use turtle wax car wash cold water formula and it works great too
930914,chimpboy_to,2015-08-23 21:17:00,27,"I too have a black lund, I wouldnt use CLR on it, that us corrosive and may damage the paint. Treat it like your car/truck - its just paint on metal, same as the car. For water spots, use a cleaner wax, lots of good suggestions here - Meguiars and Mothers are 2 good brands that are easily bought here. Keep it waxed and the water spots wont stay.  Also, if you trailer, keep a couple of the microfibre drying towels in the boat and dry it off when you pull it out of the water - will help to keep it clean and help with not transporting invasive species.  Andrew"
930980,Moosebunk,2015-08-24 03:24:00,3970,"Several times a year my black Lund gets a thorough cleaning with a car wash/wax inside and out.  Think it's Turtle Wax brand.  Carpet and vinyl flooring scrubs up nice too with a brush and the same soap or, a gentle pressure washing gets any gritty film off. Don't think it hurts a thing at all and when washing the boat one might as well do the trailer too.  They can be big investments, no harm in protecting that with a little effort."
931005,blaque,2015-08-24 13:01:00,2419,"A buddy of mine used to detail boats, and he used the 3M marine products and nothing else. I believe they are pretty pricey however"
941505,bluejays,2015-10-24 15:29:00,3,"I use the same products for our cars (Klasse all in one), takes me less than 15 minutes to wax the boat (with the help of a Porter Cable 7424xp). I wax the boat twice a year and it keeps the paint shiny all year long and make washing the boat a lot easier. "
941552,misfish,2015-10-24 17:56:00,29133,What model is that Blue?
941762,Cosmos,2015-10-26 11:59:00,588,"I think it's 1600 Fury. Friend of mine has one, looks pretty same to that one."
941768,Garnet,2015-10-26 13:00:00,2056,Just don't wax your hulls it absolutely clues the hull to the water.
941791,bigbuck,2015-10-26 15:16:00,2449,3M marine products by far. Starbrite hull cleaner to clean the scum line and you are good to go. VIM to clean the vinyl.
941936,Old Man,2015-10-27 02:40:00,822,I've got a dark blue Crestliner and I've wax it once a year when I clean it up in fall. I've been using Auto Glym Ultra Deep Shine on both my boat and my vehicles. Best wax I've ever used.
941987,misfish,2015-10-27 15:37:00,29133,Thanks Costa

942083,Mister G,2015-10-28 00:16:00,1429,"Waxing a boat is nice too look at on the trailer if that's what you're into..........but within 2 or 3 times out it will no longer look like the extreme effort you put forth to get it to look like that trailer-ed boat. However, if you are selling that old boat for maximum $$$ by all means spit the shine the crappola out of it and good luck on the sale."

I've found that waxing it cuts down on water staining and mineral deposits, and cleans up with little effort in the fall.. My boat is 9 years old and still looks  as new as the day I brought it home."
942089,irishfield,2015-10-28 00:36:00,26272,"I could never be bothered to wax a car, so I'm certainly not doing it with a boat. 9 seasons, washed with nothing but a kitchen mop and lake water. Scum line down a quick blast of Starbrite each fall, after sitting in the water for 5+ months, and a rinse. Still as shiny as the day I bought it, thanks to the PPG paint Lund used(s).  Last Monday..."
942099,cram,2015-10-28 02:28:00,1733,"That's a nice looking boat, Wayne."
