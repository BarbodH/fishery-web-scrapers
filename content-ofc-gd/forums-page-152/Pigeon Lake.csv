Heading out in a Tinny - but lake does not look to big.  Most likely targeting Muskie.  PM me if you like - and thanks in advance.  (Sorry - don't have time to search posts, which I am sure contain a lot of relevant info - will try later tomorrow)."
940905,captpierre,2015-10-21 20:34:00,2521,Good luck. North end is my area. I struck out Monday-Tuesday. I'm in no position to give you advice this time of year. Last year trolling around structure in 10-25 ft produced. Keep lure near bottom. 2.5-3.5 mph. Lots if guys like faster.
940907,AKRISONER,2015-10-21 20:38:00,5558,"South end produced for me this year, while most fish the north...id say the north has more standard structure, but is pressured heavier...cant go wrong casting the gannon narrows though. Water is colder now than when ive fished it...patience is a virtue"
940908,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-21 20:40:00,10439,Don't discount Little and Big Bald lakes on the North shore as well. I caught tons in there back in the day.
940950,Pigeontroller,2015-10-21 23:25:00,2793,Troll open water. Please have proper release gear. Be careful the lake can be rough in the right wind.
940983,ecmilley,2015-10-22 01:17:00,2163,"drawing the lakes down, right now fish are on the move and can be anywhere, like fishing around north end myself over to balds lots of rock in fall can attract bait, was marking lots on weekend shawdowing bait balls in 18-20 ft areas water temps were low to mid 50's"

(Sorry - don't have time to search posts, which I am sure contain a lot of relevant info - will try later tomorrow).  It would help to know what end of lake your fishing.  Spent a few decades fishing north end. This time of year the bass are tough to find. In north end walleye are in deep trenches, 30 to 45 ft. down jigged up 3/8 oz with white twistertail/worm stinger hook. Musky can be found in same trenches but trolled in open water, back towards structure with 8 to 12 inch jointed Believers, Jakes, etc...in perch or walleye colours. In North end need to find deepest water. Have no clue about south end."
941051,hutch4113,2015-10-22 11:51:00,374,Thanks everyone.  I also forgot to ask - any recommendations on where to Launch? Coming up from Barrie.  I suspect we will probably fish the North end of the Lake.

I suspect we will probably fish the North end of the Lake.  There is a Launch right before you hit Noggies creek north of 36 off of Bass Lake Rd. If you hit Pirates cove you've gone too far. I've never used it, so can't speak to how good it is, but I've seen it used. Send me a PM if you want some more info on the lake."
941074,Beans,2015-10-22 14:43:00,3339,There is a launch in Bobcaygeon on the north side of the river east of the dam and west of the hwy 36 bridge...  Lots of people use the Nogies Creek launch during tournaments...
941081,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-22 15:12:00,10439,I used to launch out of Nogies Creek.
941083,fishindevil,2015-10-22 15:44:00,6254,"the launch at nogies is fine and in decent shape,should have no problems getting in....good luck"
941085,lew,2015-10-22 15:49:00,12766,"the launch at nogies is fine and in decent shape,should have no problems getting in....good luck  I was by the Nogies ramp a few days ago and there were several larger boats putting in so yeah, it must still be in good shape."
941091,chris.brock,2015-10-22 16:15:00,4053," You muskie guys, when trolling in open water, just troll over a deep basin with no regard to structure? How deep do your baits run?  This may help me and Tupelo too."
941107,jimmer,2015-10-22 17:34:00,2730,"I have caught fall muskie over 40 feet of water with the bait down 15' in Pigeon. I am no specialist though. Watch out for Hurricane point if you venture over that way, the rocks can catch you off guard. You will mark schools of bait fish in the deeper water. The muskie should be around them."
941110,Sinker,2015-10-22 17:49:00,8692,"Works well in the Hali Lakes too Chris. Find bait in deep water, and the big musky are always close by. Even caught big walleyes trolling musky on those lakes with big lures trolling fast. Ya never know what you'll get in the deep water.  S."
941128,ehg,2015-10-22 20:44:00,2666,"You muskie guys, when trolling in open water, just troll over a deep basin with no regard to structure? How deep do your baits run?  This may help me and Tupelo too.  You need to know where the structure is. Big musky bait would dive 15-20 ft. down over 35-55 ft depths. Usually about 10 to 30 yds. off underwater spine of rocks, rubble that was 10-20 ft down. Gotta always watch your depthfinder."
941165,hutch4113,2015-10-22 23:53:00,374,Ok..so on Highway 36 - I turn left onto Bass Lake Road (we will be heading North on 36 - at least I think it is North). Trying to get my directions on Google Maps.. I see a couple of resorts on Bass Lake Road....but not sure if we launch there - or if there is a Public Launch on Bass Lake Rd itself?
941166,Pigeontroller,2015-10-22 23:56:00,2793,The launch is right beside the hwy 36 bridge over Nogies Creek.
