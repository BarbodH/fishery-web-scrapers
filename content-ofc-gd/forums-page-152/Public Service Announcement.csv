Love to go steel if I can afford it... We had our roof done in steel last year, cost me $520.00 more than it was going to cost if I had it re done in shingles by the time I calculated everything in. We love it, house stays cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. I would never go with shingles again!"
942395,Dutch01,2015-10-29 18:08:00,1431,Is it noisy inside when it rains?
942397,Dara,2015-10-29 18:10:00,3052,Is it noisy inside when it rains?   only when the skeletons get up there
942420,Sinker,2015-10-29 20:26:00,8692,"I haven't been in Cliffs house, but I'd say no, its not any noisier than shingles. The attic is still just as insulated as it always was.  Now a barn roof, with no attic, or insulation, yes, much louder.  Go steel all the way and never look back.  S."

I agree, not much louder but also should not have anything to do with insulation qualities either."

941994,Headhunter,2015-10-27 16:08:00,5703,"Folks, it's gonna rain tomorrow! The remnants of the hurricane that hit Mexico on the weekend are headed our way. Environment Canada is calling for 40-50mm of rain and wind gusts up to 90K. Nice fall day on Quinte, if you ask me! LOL Just thought I'd put this out there as I know that prior to this past weekend, my gutters were stuffed with leaves. With the amount of rain forecast, I would think a quick look around the house might be in order. Message complete! HH"
941997,SirCranksalot,2015-10-27 16:28:00,3291,"Moisture laden fall storm with rain and gusty winds on tap. A large shield of rain associated with this storm is forecast to spread into Southwestern Ontario tonight and reach the Golden Horseshoe area by Wednesday morning. The rain will continue to March steadily into Central and Eastern Ontario through the day on Wednesday. The rain will likely become heavy at times as the low pressure area deepens. Latest indications continue to suggest 25 to 40 mm of rain in most areas. Locally higher amounts of 40 to 50 mm are possible, especially near lakes Erie and Ontario. A clap or two of thunder is quite possible over a few locales, along with rainfall approaching Environment Canada's rainfall warning criterion of 50 mm within 24 hours. Additionally, strong and gusty southerly winds are forecast to develop on Wednesday over Southwestern Ontario then on Wednesday night over remaining parts of Southern Ontario. Wind gusts to 70 km/h are likely in most areas. Even stronger winds are quite possible near the eastern ends of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where wind gusts may approach the warning threshold of 90 km/h. Winds will become southwesterly on Thursday with strong gusts possible. These winds may be strong enough to cause some tree damage and local power outages, especially in areas where trees remain in partial to full leaf. The rain and strong winds will end by Friday as the fall storm moves away into Northern Quebec."

We get this kind of rain when it comes off the bay up in Parry Sound, but in toronto we dont see extended hard rain like this very often."
