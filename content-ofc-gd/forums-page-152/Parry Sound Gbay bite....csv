941030,floater,2015-10-22 03:02:00,220,What temp are you looking for to target muskies up there? We've been going to the Moon River area now for three years and get pike bass and pickeral but so far no muskie. Thanks
941098,AKRISONER,2015-10-22 16:48:00,5558,"after the cold snap we saw water into the high 40's on sunday.  Marked a little bait here and there but nothing crazy. Caught a few, but she was still pretty slow going.  We were fishing deeper bay trap type areas close to structure. Found a couple congregated but definitely weren't marking anything on the unit.  This will be my first fall really trying to hunt them out with the unit, and so far I havent seen zilch!"
