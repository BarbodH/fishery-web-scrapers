My wife and I have both been going through a lot of Bull at work, my wife was actually signed off work and given some meds to cope. We headed out to just relax and it was awesome, the weather was perfect, a bit chilly, but perfect fall day.  We drove from Dryden to Ignace stopping at very geocache co-ordinate. We had a pile of fun and laughed a lot, just what was needed. We are so lucky to have our beautiful child, he is a reality check when everything seems so crap…..he won ""Best Giggle"" award at his graduation ceremony this year……thought I'd share, it might brighten up your day.
