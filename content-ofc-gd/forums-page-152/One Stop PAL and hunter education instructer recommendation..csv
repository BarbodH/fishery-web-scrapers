I have been on the OHEP website and there are a number of instructors. My Dad and I are looking to take the course this winter. I have spent a lot of time in a classroom in my life and I just don't want it to be a bore. We are there to learn of course and will take it seriously but if possible we would like to enjoy it, since it will be a minimum 20 hour course. Maybe sinker or some local guys on here know of someone. Thanks"
