Any other species worth targeting? Pike or musky?  If anyone has any info we will be catch and release. I am taking a first time angler out and I'm hoping to get him on a couple nice fighting fish!  Feel free to PM me.  Thanks!"
940503,adempsey,2015-10-19 15:03:00,1498,I believe there are smallmouth in there as well.  I've only caught lakers though.
940516,James77,2015-10-19 16:23:00,175,Thanks for the info! I wish Lakers were open I've never caught one.  James
940517,chris.brock,2015-10-19 16:28:00,4053,"Yes, bass too. Some limited pike and walleye have invaded but they are tough to target since there low numbers.  There's lots of nearby stocked lakes with year round seasons for trouts."
940606,ecmilley,2015-10-20 00:57:00,2163,Lakers through the ice is all ive done there
