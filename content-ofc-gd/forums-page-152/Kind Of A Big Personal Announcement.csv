941342,SirCranksalot,2015-10-23 19:20:00,3291,maybe the first issue should come with a free bib---just to catch the drools!!!
941369,spincast,2015-10-23 22:33:00,3279,I wondered if that was what you were alluding to when last we spoke. Congrats and best wishes. May it grow into everything you hope.

941600,akaShag,2015-10-24 20:15:00,2073,"      Thanks Wayne! That was our thought as well until my art director saw the shots of all the fat hairy naked guys fishing. Clothing is now mandatory.  That is NOT me in ANY of those pictures, OK?  And GOOD LUCK MIKE!!!  Doug"
942109,4x4bassin,2015-10-28 03:28:00,1025,"Way to go Mike , can't wait"
942110,Freshtrax,2015-10-28 04:01:00,2215,"I was at a hunt camp once and they had these all text magazines about fishing and hunting. , I read them like novels, I was there for a week I can't ember the name but your writings would have fit right in.   All the best in your endeavours I'm sure it will be a success.      Anyone know the publication I'm talking about?"
942114,wormdunker,2015-10-28 08:54:00,1711,Awesome news Mike.  Good Luck!  I've read all your posts here on OFC - They are great reading.  I'm sure you will do very well.
942120,solopaddler,2015-10-28 10:37:00,8605,"Thanks guys! I'm confident in my own writing, the challenge will be finding suitable content from other writers. I'm already stressing about it big time."

Small correction here-----I think Mike's writing would have stood out from the crowd. That's why he's worried!!"
942583,Crackerjack,2015-10-30 18:58:00,34,"congrats Mike, looking forward to the first issue and everyone that follows"

Probably a good time to launch with Playboy taking the nudes out of their mags!  Good luck Mike!  Thanks Wayne! That was our thought as well until my art director saw the shots of all the fat hairy naked guys fishing. Clothing is now mandatory.

941034,chris.brock,2015-10-22 04:05:00,4053," Exciting times, you deserve it dude, this thing is going to be legendary!  Online stuff is cool, but there's something about a hard copy."

941066,PUMP KNOWS,2015-10-22 13:58:00,937,"That's awesome, congrats!"
940858,solopaddler,2015-10-21 17:58:00,8605,"My uncle who is now passed away was always my biggest supporter. One of things he always said to me was ""Mike, if you're really passionate about something you will be a success - follow your dream!""  Well, after a lot of years I'm finally taking his advice. In many ways it's the biggest leap of faith I've ever taken and I'm equal parts excited and nervous, but the fact remains there is no reward in life without some kind of risk.  I've been a writer for some time now having been published in a number of magazines including Ontario Out Of Doors. It's always been a passion, but it's also a lot of work for very little pay.  After thinking long and hard about my future earlier this year I decided to launch my own magazine. More than anything the ability to do precisely what I want to do in the way that I want means everything.  The magazine not surprisingly will be called Canada Fishing Guide and we'll primarily be highlighting interesting angling destinations from coast to coast along with some pretty great photography. A natural progression to what I've been doing online for several years now. Along with the travel features there'll be a good dose of what I think will be some really great storytelling - narrative pieces that will paint a vivid picture. Again, exactly the kind of stuff I like to read and I hope everyone else will too.  The inaugural edition will be released in early November strictly in digital format. Going forward in 2016 it will be available in both print and digital form. I'll let everyone know what's going on as the date approaches.  In the meantime here's a snapshot of the cover.  (wish me luck  )  "
940860,netminder,2015-10-21 18:07:00,514,"Very cool. You're not alone (or wrong for that matter) when you say you love reading these type of adventure stories.  Just a question, why is there a question mark at the end of the tagline?"
940863,ratherboutdoors,2015-10-21 18:10:00,132,"All the best, I'll be looking for it."
940864,msp,2015-10-21 18:11:00,1336,Sounds great Mike. Wishing you all the best !
940865,tb4me,2015-10-21 18:12:00,3295,Cant wait Mike! you have a subscriber right here bud!
940869,solopaddler,2015-10-21 18:20:00,8605,"Thanks guys, it means a lot!    Very cool. You're not alone (or wrong for that matter) when you say you love reading these type of adventure stories.  Just a question, why is there a question mark at the end of the tagline? Thanks bud. To answer the question it's not a tagline, more a subheading for one of the narrative pieces in the mag. I thought long and hard about a tagline for the actual title ""Canada Fishing Guide"". I wanted one, but the art director I'm working with talked me out of it."
