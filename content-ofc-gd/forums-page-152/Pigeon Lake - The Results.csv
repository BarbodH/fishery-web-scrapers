942267,Fisherpete,2015-10-29 00:42:00,1814,That is indeed a great pic!  Here's a few shots of barred and spotted Pigeon fish from just this year.      
942268,captpierre,2015-10-29 00:47:00,2521,That's quite a variation. I  know smallies and eyes seem to  change colour/patterns depending on their cover and surroundings. Maybe skis can change too.
941611,misfish,2015-10-24 22:34:00,29133,"Wow, all this back and forth over a bar or tiger.  Nice fish guys and congrats to all three of you.    NICE OUTING AND WELL DONE."
941616,Rich Nelson,2015-10-24 23:20:00,332,Nice fish guys. ( not a Tiger)
941617,Fisherpete,2015-10-24 23:36:00,1814,"Yeah the main message should be... Great job on fishing a new lake and doing very well guys!  Brian - the reason why this is important and being debated is that if it is indeed a tiger, this means there are now pike in Pigeon - which is not a good thing long term for what is currently a great muskie fishery there.  Honestly, it does look like a tiger from the patterning - and from the large, rounded dorsal and anal fins which are larger on tigers than on muskies - but again without seeing the tail and having a count of the pores on the underside of the jaw there can be no clear identificaton. "
941619,Tom McCutcheon,2015-10-25 00:25:00,627,"Pete is correct. Looking at the picture it sure looks like a Hybrid but more likely a Barred Muskie. As has already been mentioned by others the real definitive identifiers are the pointed fins and number of pores on the lower jaw (6 to 9) of a Muskie as opposed to rounded fins and less than 5 pores of a Pike. A Hybrid will have rounded fins and 5 to 8 pores  At this time there are no confirmed reports of Pike in Pigeon. Having said that, it is probably only a matter of time when we will see them throughout the Kawartha Lakes. Without positive identification it's tough to tell. If it is a Hybrid, it's entirely possible it has migrated from Balsam, Cameron and or Sturgeon where Hybrids have been confirmed. Muskies Canada is still working diligently to see if Northern Pike and the unique DNA strain of Kawartha  Muskies can learn to cohabitate.  All in all a great day on the water. Congrats are in order."
941627,Weeds,2015-10-25 01:02:00,782,"Really great report! Thanks for posting, makes me want to dust off the musky gear..."

941645,Tom McCutcheon,2015-10-25 12:59:00,627,"Answer for Captpierre:  One confirmed angler caught Pike in Sturgeon in 2013. At the time it was believed that this fish may have migrated from Balsam or Cameron Lakes. There may have been more since, but I haven't heard of them. The MNRF does not net Sturgeon Lake as often as  Balsam, Scugog and Rice Lakes so I am not sure how much MNRF data is available since.  Tom.  Edit: to the OP, sorry the post got off track a bit. As I said congratulations are in order."

Tom. My initial instinct was that fish came down a couple of locks from Cameron/Balsam.  Did find record of MNR creel survey (obviously small sample)  confirming they did catch both pike and tiger musky in Pigeon Lake a decade or so ago. Surely there are a few more of them now. MNR confirmation of pike, tiger-musky in Pigeon in first paragraph.  file:///C:/Users/E.H/Downloads/264328.pdf  Had place on north Pigeon for a few decades and caught, targeted hundreds of Musky. Always were 'clear' or slightly barred(depending on sun angle) .  What struck me initially was the rounded lobes of dorsal, anal and caudal fin of first fish pictured in said report ie, suggesting tiger/pike. The final fish pictured in report has the sharply pointed dorsal, anal, caudal fins typical of musky.  But whatever, at least attention has been drawn to a superb first outing on Pigeon by Tupelo."
941653,captpierre,2015-10-25 14:40:00,2521,Thanks Tom. If there are pike here on Pigeon I'm surprised I haven't hooked one. I'm always fishing pikie structure after eyes. The bass guys should be catching them too.
941657,Beans,2015-10-25 15:11:00,3339,Happy to hear you boys did well in my backyard...I used to try for lunge on opening day only...  A few years ago I was fishing the back channel with my bro-in-law (a panfish addict) for bluegills and we had half a dozen skis grab our bluegills... one was the biggest I have ever saw...looked like a big log...of course we landed none...

Pigeon is a big lake and considering it was your 1st time there you guys did very well.  If you decide to try it again next summer, the lower end is shallow and loaded with pencil reeds that hold a ton of decent fish.   Thanks Lew - I think that is something I will try next year."
941962,hutch4113,2015-10-27 12:09:00,374,"This is 100% not true about Pigeon fish being all clear. I will add some pics of barred and even spotted Pigeon fish, I would say that my ratio is 50/50 between clear and others caught from Pigeon. I have caught plenty of hybrids and know the difference between the two. That being said, the one that Tupelo posted certainly does look like a tiger from that particular shot - but need to see a better shot of the tail and have a pore count to be sure.  I will do my best to catch it again (actually - Mark has to catch it) so we can do a proper photo shoot -   .  At any rate - very interesting debate on the type of Fish - either Muskie or Tiger Muskie.  Found it informative."
941964,lew,2015-10-27 12:31:00,12766,"Thanks Lew - I think that is something I will try next year.  Anytime you can find pencil reeds it's worth stopping and tossing a big spinnerbait, those reeds can be a musky magnet....specially after dark."
941975,hutch4113,2015-10-27 14:10:00,374,"Would they still be shallow this time of year - or is it a timing thing (i.e. need to hit them when feeding)?  I am very much a novice when it comes to Muskie, so still learning the patterns. From what I have been told, they will be deep now, and that is where we were catching them."
941986,lew,2015-10-27 15:37:00,12766,The pencil reeds are pretty well done now but you'll do well in them in the springtime.

941471,hutch4113,2015-10-24 12:38:00,374,"First off, I want to thank everyone that chimed in and offered tips/advice for our outing yesterday.  It is one of the reasons I really like this board, compared to some others.  Going to a lake for the first time can always be a bit nerve racking - but all the suggestions made it much easier.  To the Fish  To set the scene, my Buddy who just got into fishing about 5 years ago, has decided he wants to try for Muskie.  So he called me up Wednesday, to see if I could go out Friday - bit of short notice but still doable. However I did mull it over - I am going away this Winter and need to save my Vacation days - I have also gone 3 to 4 years probably, without getting a sniff of a Muskie - which has been getting depressing to say the least.  So - do I go - or not.  Logic won over (a bad day fishing is better than a good day working) so off we went.  Sharing with him all the info we had gathered, the 3 of us set out:  Mark - a gentleman who is an avid Hunter, but not a Muskie fisherman. Matt - A novice, but quickly succumbing to the fishing disease - figure it is 90% over for him now...lol. Me - by no means an expert, but the only one of the group to catch a 40+ Muskie.  Even then it was by accident.  We were going for Muskie, but got bored when nothing happened and switched to a Bass presentation - so of course I caught a Muskie.  My advise to them - pretend you are fishing for Rock Bass, Sunfish, etc.  That way a Big Muskie is sure to bite.  The Dawn  To get the idea of how much Matt is into fishing now, the start time changed - from leaving Barrie at 7:30Am - then to 6:30 - and finally 6AM.  He did not want to miss a minute on the water. We were the first ones to the Launch, and it really was a beautiful morning.  Everything was frost tipped, and dead quiet.    And so the preparation began for an 8AM Launch:    That is Matt in the background, and his friend Mark.  We were going out in a boat smaller than I am used to - I had offered to take mine, but we were possibly going to a much smaller lake, that I would not have been able to launch in, so to keep it as an option we took the little tinny.  While it was tight - and Matt and I tangled lines - oh at least 3 or 4 times, it worked.  The Start  We headed out towards Big Island, trolling down the Channel.  The water was actually pretty rough for that time of the morning - Big Rollers, and a wind out of the North.  But nothing too extreme, and because we were going with the Wind it was ok.  The hunt began.  We went down the West side of the Island -  while we had a depth gauge, we had no charts, so had to kind of eyeball it, target water at least 15 feet deep, looking for drop offs, humps, etc.  As we were coming around South Birch Point, we had our first strike of the day (around 11 AM) that went to Mark.    Really a beautiful looking fish, right in the depth we expected (15 to 20 feet).  It got us really excited, and we hoped that the bite was on.  But after trolling around the same area for at least an hour - nothing.  And so it was time to move on.  The Afternoon  We started making our way North, towards Hurricane Point, up the Back Channel, alternating between trolling and casting.  By this time the wind had died, the Sun was up, and even though there was a definite Fall chill in the air, it was truly glorious.  We hit Hurricane point, and while seeing several areas of nice structure - no Fish.  At this point I had probably thrown 10 different lures, from Spinners to top water, to deep diving cranks, just to see if we would get a follower.  Then our 2nd strike - this time the honors went to Matt.    Not a big one, but at least it was a catch (as he commented - at least he did not get skunked).  This was at about 4PM. The wind had changed (now coming out of the South), and we all were getting a little tired at this point.  I have to honestly say, while I was happy for them both, I was starting to get the feeling of disappointment. The day was drawing to a close, and it looked like I would be shut out - Again.  The Last Attempt  We knew we had at least 2 hours left to fish, so we decided as a group to head back to South Birch Point, and try again.  Then we would troll back up the West side to the Launch.  But this was proving to be about the same.  As time went by it looked more and more like I would be going home empty handed.  I had thrown/used just about everything we had, so ""borrowed"" a Lure from Matt. They were using jointed cranks, with brown/red/white - he only had one more with the same colour, but not jointed - but I figured at this point colour was more important.  As the sun set into the Horizon, we started our journey back up the West side of Big Island - when we got our 3rd and final strike of the day (with about 1/2 hour of sun left)  When it happened, my brain was in numb/depressed mode.  I really thought I had just hit a rock and/or weeds.  But Mark was yelling from the front of the Boat - Fish On - and boy was he right.  I had forgotten what a Big Muskie feels like - basically a tank.  I had a really good Rod, so knew I could keep the pressure on, but it was not moving.  After a bit, Mark saw the flash of a tail, and muttered - oh - its a big one.  And yes - it was:    Now - a little about the Picture.  First off - I look like a knob (will get that out of the way).  Being in the middle of the boat, I had to lean back just so Matt could get it all in the picture.   So I look like I am having an episode (come to think of it I probably was).  At any rate, my heart was still pounding, but thinking of the Fish we did a quick measurement (at least 44 - possibly 45) and got it back into the water.  Had to help it for a bit - but it was gratifying to see it swim off - with a tail flick in my face for good measure (always deserved).  Weight - not sure - but it was heavy.  Aftermath  Fishing is always a journey of ups and downs.  But I had to remind myself as the day went on - I was out in Creation, with friends, on a beautiful day.  Regardless of the results, there are not many that have that opportunity to see how gorgeous our planet truly is:      Everyone was stoked - we did not get skunked - and for 3 guys, a small boat, and a unknown lake, did pretty good.

Barred musky are Great Lakes strain not found in Kawarthas. That is a Tiger look at rounded fins. The last, largest musky is typical Pigeon with sharp, forked fins.

With tigers that striated pattern goes right up into the gill plate, and the fish tend to be less "" green"" than a musky and a bit more ""bronze"" in colour. Its a beauty fish no doubt, but I am gonna keep my vote on barred musky, not a hybrid. About 7 or 8 years ago I caught a fish out of the Niagara River that looked just like this one (bigger of course...this is a fish story!) and I also thought it was a tiger. The kind gents (and gals) here gave me a bit of a biology/appearance lesson and I was eventually persuaded that what I had caught was a barred musky. Since then I have probably caught over 10 tigers (I used to fish Balsam a lot!) so can spot the difference a bit easier now. If I am wrong and that fish is a tiger than I have caught many more than I thought!"
