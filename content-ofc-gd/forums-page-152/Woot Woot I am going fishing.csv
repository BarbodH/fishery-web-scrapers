940767,Rizzo,2015-10-21 00:02:00,4754,Hope to have something to tell you when I get back. Probably fish 9-5 or so.
940769,captpierre,2015-10-21 00:14:00,2521,Fished for skis last evening and this morning on north Pigeon. Temps 54 degrees. Clear water. 12-20 ft. Adjacent to structure/weed beds. 2.5-3.5 mph. Windy.  Nothing. Very few boats out there. Good luck.
940772,Rizzo,2015-10-21 00:19:00,4754,Ouch. Well they stack up a bit on St Clair so hope we can get on to a couple! Either way...I won't be at work.

941116,Rizzo,2015-10-22 18:49:00,4754,Had a follow on one of my first casts....that is always a bad thing for me. Quick siting has often meant a lousy day ahead. And that came true again. It was the only fish we saw all day (spent most of day trolling though). Not a rip. Water was 52 and air was around 70. Most times when I get a warm fall day also means bad news.

Rog, you own a bass rod ? You probly missed the real action."

If you haven't been, expect a real $hit show on sunday because 10000 other anglers are headed there as well. Including me lol. Launch at Jeanettes creek if you can find parking. I'm launching out of Belle River, if I can find parking lol. The muskie bite is on!!"
