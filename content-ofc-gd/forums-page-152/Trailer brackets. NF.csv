942440,captpierre,2015-10-29 21:16:00,2521,Anybody know where I can get some brackets that would take a vertical 2x4  holding side racks around a home made utility trailer. Preferable galvanized to bolt into wood. Tried Princess Auto and HD Thanks Peter
942443,mukluk,2015-10-29 21:38:00,196,Maybe Home Hardware or TSC.
942446,Old Man,2015-10-29 21:43:00,822,"They have these bolt on stake pockets. Not sure if they're exactly what you're looking for.  http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/tapered-bolt-on-stake-pocket/A-p8240863e  TSC has them to, but only in store.  http://www.tscstores.com/Search.aspx?k=Stake+Pockets"
942495,captpierre,2015-10-30 01:25:00,2521,Thanks. These should work. Might have to cut the 2x4 a bit. Great!
