You just have to do some reading on your own, and not accept the fear mongering propaganda that is being shown.  Good on you to sniff that out Sterling.  I too suspected a rat , so I did research it and if you go back to my original post #30, I included a link to snopes where it says the actual time to recoup the initial expense could under ideal conditions could be as soon as 3 years or in a worst case scenario never. I also posted a Amazon link to the book and author of the quote, later, he appears to be legitimately concerned with emissions . The turbine farm that I see frequently stands motionless for the most part, leading me to believe it may be of the latter variety.

A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less;in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it. Clearly, the concept of net energy is crucial if we want to find a policy that will see us through the Energy Sustainability Dilemma.""'"

You take the amount we pay, and divide by what we actually receive.  Saying $0.045 is not necessarily correct, as we are paying for power we don't receive (which then inflates the actual cost per kw of nuclear power).  Some years work out better than others. Years that we don't consume as much, the nuclear cost goes up substantially, as again, we are forced via contract to purchase a certain amount of kw's per year, even if we don't actually take it.

940198,Tomcat,2015-10-17 19:11:00,395,"do some reading.  you might be surprised.  we are contracted to purchase a minimum amount of nuclear power, regardless if we actually purchase it.  which means, in periods of low power consumption, we are still paying nuclear producers a minimum amount, regardless if we use it....at those periods, the cost per kw is higher than any form of energy currently produced.  Just wondering Steve whether you could elaborate on your statement that at times, nuclear power can be the highest cost source.

That doesn't seem so bad at first glance but when you understand that nuclear and hydro electric power represent 82% of our supply whereas green sources only represent 9% of our supply, it makes me question whether spending all this money on green sources will ever have a positive payback for Ontario residents with no connection to energy supply.  Lastly, I also downloaded the Hourly Ontario Electricity Price for 2015 year to date. What shocked me the most were the huge fluctuations in the hourly cost of electricity. For instance, the hourly price of electricity at 9 AM on 2 Oct 2015 was 1053.11 cents/kWh while the price on the same day at 8 AM  was 34.3 cents/kWh. Can you shed any light on the cause for such huge fluctuations."

The demand is higher during the day when factories and offices are running.  So lots of people need to buy electricity.  When the factories are not operating fewer people want to buy electricity so the demand side of the equasion drops.  It comes down to supply and demand."

940157,Steve,2015-10-17 17:43:00,2075,"there is an increase in hydro cost (which as I already shown is only equal to the USA) because someone has to provide incentive for the developers to build and improve green forms of technology. (whether that be wind turbines, pv solar panels, or hydro facilities). The first solar farm (large utility scale) was built in 2008. From then to now, the technologies have increased by almost 500%.  In 10 years from now, it'll be even that much better.  The government needs private companies to research and develop more efficient ways of generating clean energy. No one is going to do this out of the goodness of their own heart. As such, incentives need to be given to developers. These intensives are paid by our tax dollars.  Certainly, it is much more complicated than that, but that is it in a nutshell."

A pile typically took about 5 minutes to drill once the operators got the hang of it  We had to redo one section on the south side as it was all sorts of outta wack  The northing and easting measurements were WAY OFF  I actually had to go in and tell the contractors that not every pile was meant to be exact length because thats how they started, when in fact it was designed to contour the land(ie it would dip at the roads etc)  Once we got that straight though things went up quick!  And did I mention the pay was great? Lol  Once I switched from TBT engineering(as they were done there contract) I moved over to black and macdonald  There I worked with the electritions to tie everything up(boy was that a chore with the gloves you have to wear and in -15 weather)  It was a fun project, I learned alot  I'm glad the pay was good. You played a VERY IMPORTANT role (arguably the most important part) in the installation of that farm. The number one problem with the installation of a solar farm is getting the helical piles correct. The hardest sites to do this on are sites that have a mix of soil and rock....  As you mentioned, each pile has to be a different length, depending on the depth of the bedrock.  I can tell you, one site I visited under construction had the installer hitting bedrock at unexpected depths, and simply cutting off the top of the pile, so it looked like they were all set at the correct height. That decision cost the EPC contractor about $3M in addition costs to re-engineer their entire site.  What you did was invaluable in the long term success of that site - good on ya!"
940167,manitoubass2,2015-10-17 18:14:00,11391,Thanks man!  I actually followed each driller for a few hours each morning for 4 days to teach them how to do it. Id measure on the spot to save time.  Each driller got a good system going and I was measuring RTKs and northing and easting by hand to the tune of 350 piles per day.  Here is a pic of the conditions lol  And also a football i made from tape the held the elctrical on the panels as they were installed lol.  Gotta have fun on breaktime?   
940168,manitoubass2,2015-10-17 18:17:00,11391,The mud was very hard to drill through. The cylindical of the bottom of the pile would slip off its mark quite often and that was a real challenge in late fall early winter
940169,Steve,2015-10-17 18:19:00,2075,"drilling piles is the toughest part of a solar farm installation.  I insure one farm that has maybe 24"" of loose soil, then bedrock....  the installers literally kicked the soil aside, and installed directly on bedrock, using rock anchors.  that site will never move.....  little more cost with rock anchoring, but way better in the long run.  but this has taken this thread off track.....and MB, you never cease to amaze me with your background and history."
940175,manitoubass2,2015-10-17 18:30:00,11391,"Thanks!   And yes back on topic(ive noticed Im very good, unfortunately at derailing threads)  My bad"

940188,Steve,2015-10-17 18:54:00,2075,"again, gas fired turbines, while better than coal, are not a clean source of energy.....  this is, I thought, common knowledge.  steam turbines still need a heat source to heat the water to turn to steam. Only option that doesn't produce carbon dioxide is nuclear.  Or of course, water turbines using moving water to turn - that is clean and green."
940114,Steve,2015-10-17 16:03:00,2075,"The local band office down home just finished a environmental study to put up a windmill farm basically across the front of henvey inlet and key harbour ,I think it will just add to the mystic untouched beauty of the French River  That is correct.  One of the biggest proponents for wind and solar development are the Indian reserves. They truthfully could care less about where they go up...as long as they get paid."
940116,Canuck2fan,2015-10-17 16:09:00,1444," I agree in general, but the situation in the past was so different from what it is now or likely to be in the future that there are limited lessons to be learned. If there is a lesson, it's that decisions should be made based on economics rather than politics but, as I said, I just don't see that happening. I agree that it was partly economic in the past----a stable power supply at cost was a major factor in the industrialization of Ont. OTOH, a large part of the D'ton overrun was due to D Peterson putting the plant on hold after Hydro had purchased major eqpt and was paying the mid-teen interest rates current in the mid-eighties.. Which is not to say there was no mis-management---always lots of that to go around in the past as well as today.  If only we could separate the politics from the issue of Hydro LOL.  You are quite correct in that a large part of the over runs at Darlington were due to interest rates being high during the project. NO ONE foresaw them, ever going that high. Inflation was rampant, workers demanded more just to fall behind a little less... Wicked times financially.  That spike in interests rates is kind of like how no one expected oil to be sub $45.00 a barrel ever again when the contracts were signed for renewables at the high prices they were signed for at.  What bites is no matter what happens with bizarre market conditions or governments making bad decisions we KEEP having to pay for the mistakes of judgement."
940118,manitoubass2,2015-10-17 16:13:00,11391,Wow!
940119,Steve,2015-10-17 16:17:00,2075,"do the research. i see it first hand.  you're aware of the grand river land tract I'm quite sure. you're aware of all the ""stop work"" actions the local natives have done on all development within 10km's of each side of the river.  well, the native's had no problem giving up 440 hectars (yes hectars) of land for a huge samsung solar development....no actions, no protests, no stop work actions....  why?  well, they were given 10% equity in the project. They didn't have to contribute anything, except one site trailer whey a representative from the local band sat and watched tv every day. but that 10% equity worked out to approx $40 million.  So give them $40 million and everything goes ahead.  If you go to the government website that shows approved sites for future wind and solar development, currently 60% of that approved land is native reserves. Want to know what is even better? No environmental studies are required if developing on native land. That sounds strange right? Want to know why? Because the natives themselves (or the band leaders) use that as incentive for developers to use their land...."

940138,Steve,2015-10-17 17:09:00,2075,"do some reading.  you might be surprised.  we are contracted to purchase a minimum amount of nuclear power, regardless if we actually purchase it.  which means, in periods of low power consumption, we are still paying nuclear producers a minimum amount, regardless if we use it....at those periods, the cost per kw is higher than any form of energy currently produced.    I also just did some reading on the RRFN solar farm.  Like I suspected, they are only providing their land, much like the deal I mentioned down here. Capital is being provided by Conner, Clark and Lunn, as well as Terrma Capital.  Further, the reason it took so long to get shovel to ground was initially (in 2008) RRFN planned to put up wind turbines. However, like I already said in this thread, developers don't just put turbines up all over the place without conducting viability studies.  In the case of RRFN, their 2.5 year viability study (which included erecting a MET Tower) said it wasn't viable to put up a wind farm on their land. So off it went to the idea of solar.  In 2010 they started the solar viability study. However, it was shown that there wasn't enough T&D capacity to allow for a solar farm.  In 2013 they submitted a plan that included updating the T&D lines in the area, so that the solar farm could go ahead.  February, 2014 construction starts. Completes January 2015 (received COD status).  So, no, it wasn't 7 years in development, at least not the solar portion.  But this interesting case does prove that no, you don't just raise turbines anywhere...tests are done...and when it is determined the location is not viable, you move on to another solution - in this case solar.  Also, it proves that as a developer, Conner Clark Lunn, and Terrma Capital, it is best to partner with a band of natives, as they have the land, and want to sell it."

The only way up is infrastructure/education/ecdev etc.  But these plans take alot of time to see fruition.

Unfortunately, I don't see any evidence that they (large companies in general) are actually getting top talent. I hear you, I just never agreed that paying people big bucks will get the best of the bunch. My conspiracy theory is that it is just a way to line each other's pockets.

I've said this before, but why are individual households subsidising industry's electricity costs. ""On Peak"" is the result of businesses using hydro to run their business. Should they then should the lion's share of the cost vs individual home owners? Does this wonderful government expect me to cook dinner on my electric stove at 9:00 at night.

So right in the middle. Further, on the link, it shows the overall average price for all 51 states combined is 12.98 cents per kw.  coincidentally, that is basically the exactly price as our mid peak power price.  however, where we truly get screwed is the on peak power price at 17.5 cents. Only 9 of the 51 states have higher prices than 17.5 cents...  so essentially, if you can use on the off peak, your getting your power cheaper than all 51 states. if you use it at mid peak, your paying exactly what the US pays on average. If you use it during peak power, well, your getting screwed....and that sucks!!"

The concept of net energy must be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics. A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.   Now, when you alter someone's comments to fit an agenda, it shows ulterior motive.  Before a wind park is constructed, developers erect meteorological towers (MET towers) that registers wind speeds over long periods of time. This way the developer can accurately estimate the cost return on a project.  Developers in this province do not develop in ""poor"" locations.  As such, a 3 year period (or less) is what it takes to reach a net benefit for clean power on our grid.  The Ontario Power Authority contracts are all 20 year guaranteed rate contracts.

940079,Canuck2fan,2015-10-17 12:28:00,1444,"Hydro has always been a disaster in Ontario.... For decades we under charged businesses, to keep them here with cheap rates. That really worked out great didn't it. My home town has rows upon rows of factories that left long before, the cost of juice increased and the current government came in. Does your home town have the same rows?  Along, the way we gave a monopoly the ability to issues bonds, so they could run up massive debts. EVERY project under EVERY government in Hydro's history went massively over the projected cost... Check out the nukes at Darlington as an example  The sad thing about the push for renewable sources, is that it was started in earnest at the worst possible time. Oil was at the high $100.00+ mark, meaning gas plants were going to cost more to run. Talk of climate change was indicating new gas plants were the way to go long term. Remember when smog alerts were a lot more numerous in the GTA? NIMBYS had shown they weren't going to allow any damn gas plant to happen anywhere near their grossly over inflated property values. Governments at every level in Canada wouldn't dare put up a parking meter without having 10 consultants do 20 different studies, much less form a new strategy, for creating renewable sources of energy.  Business and the consultants saw the opportunity, along with a weak government stung by every decision they had made about Hydro. So they sold them on offering huge incentives to create MORE energy, at the most expensive rates ever. Though in time those rates would be more in line with the price of non renewables because oil was only going to go up in price..... oops.  Weak governments, greedy businesses are never a good combination when it comes to a necessity that is traded as a commodity.  Now we have the sale of part of a great public asset, from a weak government to greedy businesses, as if that will somehow magically lower our rates? I hope it will, but have my doubts for historical reasons...  The only way any government in Ontario can lower Hydro rates from now on for rate payers is to subsidize it by having the taxpayers pick up the tab. Doesn't work for me because I am both a rate payer and taxpayer...  Alternately, a government could artificially freeze rates, run up debt and we could have our kids pay it off, with interest. I wonder is there still room on Harper's granddaughter's mythical credit card, maybe our kids could sweet talk her when the times comes to pay up.  They could also go in and seize every asset, fire everybody, hire new people to do the exact same jobs for a lot less money. Run it is a ministry providing a necessity. Tell any debt holder, enjoy your hair cut you aren't getting a dime. Strictly, monitor the cost and charge not a penny more for the juice. Have no unions, safety training or environmental concerns, cheap juice trumps any worries about the damage to the planet. Legally mandate the bare minimum for maintenance and infrastructure improvements. Jail time, for any CEO who company is working on a project that goes over budget. If we need a new plant built, build it where it makes sense. Let the NIMBY's squawk, but post their names and addresses on a website saying these are the few people who are driving up everyone else's hydro costs. After all the law suits settled, it might be cheaper maybe not...  In short we are going to pay more no matter what...."

940093,Canuck2fan,2015-10-17 14:32:00,1444," That's your version of history. Others have their own version. I don't think there is a lot to be gained by looking back at the history and pointing fingers. No danger of the  proverbial 'history repeating itself' here because times have changed so much. Past decisions were made for political rather than economic reasons and I don't see that changing any time soon. Do you?  You are right it is just my version... What is yours? I believe if we don't learn from past mistakes we will just repeat them... I totally disagree past decisions were made for solely political reasons, big users were charged less because it seemed to make ECONOMIC sense.  Lower rates for big users were supposed to keep heavy manufacturing here in Ontario. Providing jobs with a good living for workers. Those employees would spend money, on houses, cars, and the necessities of life all while also paying taxes. It seemed like a good idea to all concerned, until the businesses left anyways for various reasons.  How do you think we can really and truly pay less than we are now?"
940095,Steve,2015-10-17 14:35:00,2075,"Most the time I drive by the ones here they are motionless or barely moving, I sincerely doubt they are recouping the cost in 3 years.  Southern Ontario in general is a less than ideal location , best locations here is a relative term. What they are is a highly visible blight on the rural landscape and a the perfect smokescreen for politicians and the Liberal government to point at and boast "" Look at what we are doing for the environment ""  I just hear a low  whirring noise, see an eyesore and dead migratory birds. Keep drinking that red koolaid  The ones that are motionless are under maintenance. Truthfully, you have no clue how long it takes to recoup, so your sincerest doubt is irrelevant.  Question: Where do you hear the whirring noise? Specifically please. As part of my job is doing decibel tests, the only way to be close enough to hear the noise is to be within 250m of one. The only way you would be that close is if you leased your OWN Land (and getting paid to do so), as government setbacks are 500m is you lease your land for one, or 1km if you don't. Testing shows the human ear can hear the ""whirring sound"" within 250m of the base of a 2MW turbine (and even further away for the turbines that are higher in the air).  This fishing board is fun to read the general public's understanding on many things in life. Food, Politics, Construction / Renovation, etc. etc. But what it also shows is the lack of education relating to many of the topics discussed.  And the scary part is, all the correct information is out there to be read. Most of us are simply to lazy to do so, so instead we talk about whirring sounds and dying birds, lol."

I agree in general, but the situation in the past was so different from what it is now or likely to be in the future that there are limited lessons to be learned. If there is a lesson, it's that decisions should be made based on economics rather than politics but, as I said, I just don't see that happening. I agree that it was partly economic in the past----a stable power supply at cost was a major factor in the industrialization of Ont. OTOH, a large part of the D'ton overrun was due to D Peterson putting the plant on hold after Hydro had purchased major eqpt and was paying the mid-teen interest rates current in the mid-eighties.. Which is not to say there was no mis-management---always lots of that to go around in the past as well as today."

I understand finding information for yourself can be tough, so if you want real information, just ask....my daily job is insuring solar, wind, and small hydro. It is my job to know about every part of the process....from pre land leasing, to covering land prior to development, to the actual development, to the completed development and future 20 year operation.

We are also paying other jurisdictions to take our ""extra power"" . How on gods green earth is it that we are paying New York State to take our power. I've said this before, but why are individual households subsidising industry's electricity costs. ""On Peak"" is the result of businesses using hydro to run their business. Should they then should the lion's share of the cost vs individual home owners? Does this wonderful government expect me to cook dinner on my electric stove at 9:00 at night. Should all my weekend time be devoted to laundry so I can afford the run my appliances. It's a mockery of a travisty. Did anyone else notice on the news recently that Canadians pay the highest monthly charges for cell phone?  Transit costs near the top of the world as well.

I'm all for green initiatives even if it means paying a ton for electricity. I'd rather a hole be burned in my wallet than in the atmosphere.  The main reason hydro is expensive is that the company providing it has a monopoly, and it's a public institution.  Now excuse me while I go vomit at the thought of this price hike.
