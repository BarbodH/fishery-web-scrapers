941728,Bernie,2015-10-25 22:01:00,3190,I gave up on Nascar. It became all advertising and money. Not as much of it to see on TV as it was all pay to play.No more Speed Channel was the final nail in the coffin.Too bad as at one time it was fun to watch.

No more Speed Channel was the final nail in the coffin. Too bad as at one time it was fun to watch.  Well Im not saying im not happy, but Nascar just made another bad choice IMO. Before this race,they decided not to have 3 attemps at a green white checker, but to do only one. Truely believe this cost junior the win and a spot in the next round. Oh well, it is what it is and I as well Bernie, am losing interest.  Junior was the top driver today by none.  Again, thanks George for the link."
