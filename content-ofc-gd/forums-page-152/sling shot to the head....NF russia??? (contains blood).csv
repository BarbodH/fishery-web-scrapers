941203,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 03:24:00,11391, Click on the video that shows a bloody head
941204,NAW,2015-10-23 03:27:00,4022,"Seen that a while back.  Buddy gets messed up pretty bad.  He's got to have a bad cuncusion.  Or worse, no??"
941205,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 03:31:00,11391,Oh man Id think a fractured skull but who knows???  I wish him well but for the slingshot he built and his aim youde think he knew better???  That could have easily killed him
941214,Rizzo,2015-10-23 11:47:00,4754,"weird thing is....look at the guys shirt...looks like he's already covered in blood before it happens! Not the first time buddy beaned himself methinks. He bleeds good though, I give him credit."
941218,AKRISONER,2015-10-23 12:39:00,5558,lol pretty sure that blood on his shirt is just a design...still hilarious though...i wish it showed the slow motion cam to show exactly what caused it to ricochet so bad.
941223,Beavertail,2015-10-23 12:52:00,331,That's gonna leave a mark. The guy obviously put some time and thought into the slingshot and camera/light set-up...did he not take into account the possibility of ricochet's??? He's using steel ball bearings and the back stop doesnt look too soft. I guess he learned the hard way! Better his skull than his eye.
