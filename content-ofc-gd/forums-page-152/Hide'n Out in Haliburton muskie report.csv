There's so many options this time of year.  I went for skis. It was a one follow, one strike, one fish morning.    I could have been better, it could have been worse too.    I did find an old memory card with some trail camera pics at the cottage.  Cute little bugger that could probably rip your hand off pretty quickly.       Uh oh, I wasn't really looking for you.     All seasons are great up there, but this time of the year is awesome."

But I was just scrolling thru the pictures at 1st without reading the text and came across the critter in the snow and couldn't believe you got all that white stuff last night when I'm not too far south and we're sitting here sunny & warm"
