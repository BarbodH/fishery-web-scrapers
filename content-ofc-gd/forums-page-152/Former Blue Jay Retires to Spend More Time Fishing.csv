Burnett has just finished a professional baseball career that spanned 17 seasons in which the towering right-handed pitcher won a World Series title, pitched a no-hitter, and managed to make his first All-Star Team in his final season with the Pittsburgh Pirates. As for his post-baseball plans? They include a lot of fishing.  “I joke around and tell a lot of people that I’m really a good fisherman,” Burnett told Pitssburgh Post-Gazette Monday, “and baseball’s just a hobby.”  While Burnett’s response about being a fisherman with a simple baseball hobby might seem tongue-in-cheek, the reality is he has long been vocal about his passion for fishing.

941120,Dara,2015-10-22 19:15:00,3052,Sounds like pretty much the same reason as any of us retire...more time for fishing
941130,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-22 20:46:00,479,"That's pretty cool. You'd never expect a possible future HoF to be on the banks fishing for bass. With the amount of earnings he's made, he could start his own fishing series."

941179,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 00:51:00,11391,I wonder if he can pitch a jig?  Ill be here all week try the veal???
941182,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-23 01:10:00,479,"One of the pics from the link has him fishing along some shoreline. But ya, he probably has a pretty pimped out bass boat with all the bells and whistles.  Maybe there should be a similar series to Pimp My Ride and have one for bass boats."

941193,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-23 01:53:00,479,He's not a hall of famer I never said he was.

941198,manitoubass2,2015-10-23 02:36:00,11391,Lol
941212,Rizzo,2015-10-23 11:42:00,4754,"he's not the first I am sure. Many ballplayers, especially the ones from the southern U.S., are big time into bass fishing"
941226,netminder,2015-10-23 13:15:00,514,"he's not the first I am sure. Many ballplayers, especially the ones from the southern U.S., are big time into bass fishing true. Can't remember if it was spring training or the all star break when Gibbons and Buerhle and someone else I can't recall went fishing down in Florida."
