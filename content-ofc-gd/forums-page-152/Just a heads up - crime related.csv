There an increase in battery thefts from larger trucks - box trucks, transports etc. and large construction equipment. There is also a lot of propane tanks being stolen from forklifts and trailers.  Just be mindful of where your equipment is parked etc. I know these batteries can be expensive and I'd hate for anyone to have to replace them.  Take care"
942128,Joey,2015-10-28 12:00:00,9122,Thank you

942133,DanD,2015-10-28 12:44:00,2223,The metal scrappers must be starting their Xmas fund. Lead is going for .55 cents a pound. Batteries whole are .32 cents. They'll break the batteries down and just take in the lead plates.  http://www.premierrecycling.ca/contact/premier-recycling-mississauga-ltd/pricing/  Dan.

942137,fishing n autograph,2015-10-28 13:01:00,2540,Or resell to shady shops
942138,Big Cliff,2015-10-28 13:03:00,6899,Thanks for the heads up!

942151,JoshS,2015-10-28 13:53:00,729,I had my boat stored in an outdoor parking yard for a month earlier this summer in scarborough and someone broke in and stole 50+ batteries from trucks and school buses. I was lucky they missed my boat. The property owner was convinced the thieves are using the battery acid to make drugs... not sure if that is the case or not.
942152,fishing n autograph,2015-10-28 13:54:00,2540,There is battery acid in methamphetamine
942167,misfish,2015-10-28 15:47:00,29133,"So the acid for drugs, the propane to boil everything.  What are these people doing to themselves and others."
942169,fishing n autograph,2015-10-28 16:00:00,2540,"Or the batteries are being resold, which is more of a possibility"
942213,Big Cliff,2015-10-28 19:54:00,6899,"Drain the acid to make drugs, refill with water to get paid for the weight at the scrap yard, use the propane to make drugs, sell the empty cylinders to the scrap yard for scrap steel. Sounds like a good business plan to me!"
