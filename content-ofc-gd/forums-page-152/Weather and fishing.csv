942190,irishfield,2015-10-28 17:47:00,26272,"Well Sinker.... you'd think that... but it certainly didn't work for us yesterday after 9 hours of targeting every hump, bump and open water stretch of water that we know produces."
942192,fishindevil,2015-10-28 17:59:00,6254,my buddy in haliburton has been hammering the wallweye last 2 days and been on some awesome fish it started to die off yesterday morning and the smallie bite died as well and today well we see what came in .....
942193,AKRISONER,2015-10-28 18:07:00,5558,"strange pattern here, but this might change in the fall? I fished last weekend before the saturday storm...friday was clear and the fishing was garbage...after the storm was ok...and obviously during the storm was straight fire...  but it seems like in the fall the calm before the storm is no good, while in the summer it is?"
941812,Dutch01,2015-10-26 16:35:00,1431,"Interesting weekend in the Kawarthas.  Two of my buddies decided to jump the gun and head up on Friday instead of Saturday as we had  planned. They got two walleye. These are good fishermen, skilled at catching walleye and very familiar with ""our spot"". I tend to think if the fish were there, they would have found them.  We went Saturday, and braved the rain, because I had a hunch..... The weather was awful, with driving rain and gusty winds, but boy did it pay off!. We hammered them all night, 23 walleye in 4 hours. Largest was 5.5#, and most were over 3#. My Son caught the big girl, it was his personal best. It was a night to remember for sure.  Same two guys, pissed that they missed out, headed up last night again. The only got one (albeit a 30"" fish!).  I'm curious if you guys have experienced this before.  Do you think it was the rain, that it was warmer than other nights this week. Or maybe it was the barometric pressure (my theory).  Let me know if you have any opinions one way or another.  PS: pics are tough at night, but we got a few. I can't upload from my phone because I have to remove EXIF data first. Does anyone know a good app for this?"
941816,AKRISONER,2015-10-26 16:57:00,5558,"weather and fishing are 10000000000% correlated.   Went up friday...literally didnt even get a bite...saturday came, we caught 25 walleye in 2 hours, headed out for smallies and caught 7 with 5 of them being over 4lbs.  sunday morning, the walley bite was a lot slower, caught 12 in 3 hours. but then headed in and my buddy caught an 8lber of the end of the dock.  Storms are the ticket, fish during a storm, you will catch a lot."
941817,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 17:02:00,11391,My favorite time to fish is RIGHT before a storm hits.  But i dont care much ill fish in almost any conditions regardless
941820,Dutch01,2015-10-26 17:11:00,1431,"I've always known there was a correlation, but I'm trying to nail it down and make it a science!  There was an almost full moon, but that was also true Friday and Sunday. This also wasn't quite before the storm, more during.  I think it is the barometric pressure drop that preceded the storm that triggers them. I'm going to start monitoring pressure more closely moving forward.  I was supposed to be back up there Wednesday night, but it's supposed to rain much worse! I'm still drying out from Saturday, not sure I'm willing to brave it to test my theory...."
941829,mr blizzard,2015-10-26 17:45:00,1589,Interesting  I believe the barometric pressure has a lot to do with it. Just to Add a curve to your thread what about wind direction  back on simcoe an east wind shut down perching for us but some of the best whitie action we used to have was an east wind as the sto was kicking up
941842,Sinker,2015-10-26 18:07:00,8692,I have an actual barometer that I swear by. A changing barometer always brings good fishing.  S.
941844,Dutch01,2015-10-26 18:16:00,1431,"I believe wind was from the Southeast Saturday night but I can't quite recall....  Wind has an effect for sure, in this spot it also affects if you can cast to where the fish are. If there's a strong South wind, your cast is coming back on shore!"
941845,Dutch01,2015-10-26 18:17:00,1431,Great idea! I'm going to have to get me one of those.

I'm still drying out from Saturday, not sure I'm willing to brave it to test my theory.... fishing just after a storm is usually pretty tough. I always like to go right before one is scheduled or about 3-4 days after one when the fish get really hungry.  As for the moon stuff, it's usually 3 to 4 days after a full or new moon that brings out the strongest bite.  That being said usually whenever I have spare time is the best time for me to be on the water."
941849,Dutch01,2015-10-26 18:31:00,1431,Truer words were never spoken!
941850,Big Cliff,2015-10-26 18:54:00,6899,"Here is what I know: A cold front moving in makes the walleye bite a lot tougher, doesn't mean you can't catch them but that is when I go to live bait and fish really slow.  My best walleye fishing (for numbers on a lake and I fish the Kawarthas ) has always been when it was windy and the more wind, the more fish (not so much on a river). I have fished days when it wasn't fun to fish because it was so rough but the fish were hitting like crazy. River fishing doesn't seem to be affected as much by the cold front, might be because of the way I tend to fish a curent though.  Weather does play a huge role but in most cases if you adjust your tactics (time/location/presentation) you can catch them! If one thing isn't working it's time to try something else! I can't tell you how many times I have been in a boat with someone and either they or I were pounding them and the other person wasn't. Same bait, different presentation, totally different day of fishing!"
941851,AKRISONER,2015-10-26 18:54:00,5558,"if the wind is blowing, fishing the in an area where fish can escape from the chop just outside of the mess usually produces."
941853,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 19:04:00,11391,"Yeah cliff river fishing is quite different.  Ive spend years journaling all the info I can to make patterns. I can tell you this, the biggest factor on a river is the fluctuation of depth  If you can figure out the rivers, lakes are easy(outside the big big bodies of water)  Take me to erie Id have no clue ???"
941856,msp,2015-10-26 19:31:00,1336,try this experiment. It explains a lot       
941859,manitoubass2,2015-10-26 19:50:00,11391,Hahaha msp thats really cool!
941863,mr blizzard,2015-10-26 20:08:00,1589,"msp thanks for sharing, gunna try one, maybe now I will have one up on Dave  :tease: unless he sees this thread lol"
941865,Sinker,2015-10-26 20:16:00,8692,Sheesh....I paid big bucks for my barometer.....that one does the exact same thing! It doesn't lie. A falling barometer always makes them bite.....falling baro with the right wind is the best.  S.
941870,moxie,2015-10-26 20:45:00,1566,Many variables associated with fishing but one thing is for sure and that is that no matter how unfavourable conditions might be fish have to feed. Only question is will you be there when they do.
942011,netminder,2015-10-27 18:41:00,514,"So by this logic, since there is such a storm coming in tonight that there is a ""special weather statement"" coupled with the full moon we should have some nice fish porn to look at tomorrow?  If only I wasn't at work at sundown is at like 5pm..."
942023,Dutch01,2015-10-27 20:02:00,1431," I checked the forecast for a town near where I fish, and it shows barometric pressure dropping from 103 right now to 99.8 by tomorrow evening.  Add in the full moon and I'm betting they're active tonight!"
942040,Sinker,2015-10-27 21:22:00,8692,My barometer is telling me I should be fishing.  S.
942043,manitoubass2,2015-10-27 21:30:00,11391, No fishing for me.  Eat and sleep and hope i wake up tomorrow?
942050,Consigliere,2015-10-27 22:15:00,121,"Check out buck perry's book spoonplugging. Weather, light and water conditions and how the impact fishing and fish activity is explained in good detail. The best resource I have seen on the subject by a mile."
942075,Dutch01,2015-10-27 23:17:00,1431,Thanks for the tip!
942186,SuperDave,2015-10-28 17:34:00,204,That's a cool video. Problem is by the time I hop in my truck and drive 3 hrs. to my destination the pressure could change again! Fish when you can and hope for the best.
