It was pretty chilly but we managed to get out for some fishing and hunting.  Caught some nice fish and a few birds. We have a great year class of pike on the river after all these years of catch and release.  We cant go out without catching one or two pike over 32 inches!! - well..  she can got out without catching one or two pike over 32 inches!!                          Averys back next week and then its a week of fishing and bird hunting again before we close up camp, and the long wait till Maple syrup begins!!"
