941603,akaShag,2015-10-24 20:33:00,2073,"Great report, Bunk, and you can have that sleeping ina  tent stuff in gnarly weather.  Been there, done that, and my cranky old back likes its creature comforts these days!  Canvas (or nylon) is not a heck of a lot of good to you if Mister Bear comes to investigate.  You need some skookum bear medecine.  Doug"

938136,spincast,2015-10-04 18:15:00,3279,sweet road trip - almost Jack Kerouac with the exhaustion booze and curvy views - just need some happenin' toons. Love that water.
938198,irishfield,2015-10-04 22:11:00,26272,"Hey, if you just had of told me you were going I could have spent 2 days trying to kill myself getting there... slept on an airport floor.. fished for 7 hours and then flew all the way back home again. Oh I did that once.. once was enough!  Some great fishes there Bunk, I do truly hope to get on that fishery again with you and our good friend Dan."
938234,chris.brock,2015-10-05 00:06:00,4053," GCS of 3 eh, I had to google that.  That's another lake I want to see. Disappointing to here there was quite a few other guys cruising around. How far did you run to set up camp?  Another crazy trip most guys would never do Bunk and Selfmade, very cool."

Heard of this author... don't know anything about him tho.  Now will have to look that up.  I do truly hope to get on that fishery again with you and our good friend Dan.  That'd be all good with me Wayne.  This year, your plane wouldn't have liked you very much for setting in down any length of time on that lake.  GCS of 3 eh, I had to google that.  That's another lake I want to see. Disappointing to here there was quite a few other guys cruising around. How far did you run to set up camp?  After Labor Day that lake gets pretty busy in different spots for specks.  We set-up our camp usually away from the others.  That kinda thinking requires a GCS of 16."

938257,captpierre,2015-10-05 01:54:00,2521,Dude. Another incredible report. Makes my fishing seem Mickey Mouse. Keep it up. Rock on.
938262,Gerritt,2015-10-05 02:29:00,6129,Dang!
938265,Steelheadphycho,2015-10-05 03:15:00,470,Tent camping in that weather is not for sissies....... You and yer partner have some big-uns!  Great report as always Bunk!!
938268,manitoubass2,2015-10-05 04:08:00,11391,"Epic bunk!  Warrior style, i like it!  I dont get to do it often but i do a trip once a year"
938278,Guidofisherman,2015-10-05 13:14:00,206,"I have been waiting for this report and wasn't disappointed. You were right saying, ""Speckers here, speckers there, bloody speckers out fishing everywhere."" It seems to be getting more crowded each year.  At one favourite spot, a boat pulled up near mine and shouted, ""Hey Al, I've never seen your boat so dirty"".  For an O.C.D. person like me, I got a real laugh out of your comment. I think the windy weather had a part in grouping up the anglers also. At that time of the year you can expect a few  days of wind that might drive you off the lake or at least reposition, but this year was especially rough. Makes it tough to fly fish. Really nice photos!!! Especially like the BT closeups and the sunset shots. Great selfie. Already looking forward to next year and maybe then my boat will be just as dirty but with fish slime."
938281,adempsey,2015-10-05 13:24:00,1498,"Thanks for the report!    Beautiful fish, I don't think they come any better than that.     Excellent photos as usual too!  I am curious, does ORR stay fully booked in Sept/Oct ?  Sounds like it..."
938287,muskymatt,2015-10-05 14:13:00,2608,Simply fantastic!! 
938290,Tomcat,2015-10-05 14:19:00,395,"Thanks for another great report Bunk. Pictures were much appreciated, especially those of the specks. Thanks for sharing."
938311,blaque,2015-10-05 18:40:00,2419,Spectacular read and photos. Seriously  Thanks man
938355,Joeytier,2015-10-05 22:30:00,3990,"That was a great read.  The indian summer of September really messed up the closing weeks of specklin' around here, I'd say you two did well enough"
938357,davey buoy,2015-10-05 22:39:00,5505,"Always a great report Drew,as said you guys did very well under those conditions. You guys are hardcore, lovin that determination.!!!!  as always."
938381,Moosebunk,2015-10-06 01:09:00,3970,"Thanks guys.   I am curious, does ORR stay fully booked in Sept/Oct ?  Sounds like it...  June thru early July and October thru November are the busiest months.  September you could likely find room.  ...

Ohhhh that road, cringed along the way this time.  Understood your filth too   it's acceptable this time around Alan.  I'm sure it'll be spotless next time we play bumper boats on the lake.  Judging by these photos one wouldn't think it was windy much at all, but really, for at least part of everyday but one, there were times we weren't going too far.  And man, low water too.  When I think I've got a handle on the shoals out there they still surprise sometimes.  Next year not likely there, thinking arctic char or maybe specks elsewhere for a change... plenty more slime for you then."
