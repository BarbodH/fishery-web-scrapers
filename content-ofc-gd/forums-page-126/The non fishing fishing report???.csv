Im down  He gets here late because I dont know the names of the stores in my own town and gave him the wrong directions ???  After a brief chat, we head to the spot and low and behold, 5 or 6 people are fishing there so thats a no go. My lil friend brendan had a lil smallie on so I snapped a quick pick    So the wind was rediculous anyhow, 40-50km straight into the face, so we forgo fishing, and I show him around RRFN. Checked out the rapids and seen a few small sturgeon shallow, also some jumping.        Showed him the ancient ""turtle head"" rock, still had some offerings below it. Laid some tobacco and took a quick pic. Told him the story of why its called the turtle head    And a quick pic to show he was here    After that we headed west to barwick for a few casts off the dock but it was far too windy.  So basically we just chatted and hung out.  Kinda a bummer but great company and a good way to kill a few hours?  sounds like plans are in the making for a LOTWs trip at the start june?  Thanks for stopping by bud! Always a pleasure  "

970710,manitoubass2,2016-05-23 03:22:00,11391,"Haha for sure! Ah well it was better than nothing at all.  Between the two of us I think we had enough tackle to open up a small shop, and 4 lures got wet???"
970793,wormdunker,2016-05-24 01:24:00,1711,"you must have used 3 then, cause I only used 1!  LOL!  It was a great time Rick, Thanx.  If you guys ever get the chance to visit Fort Frances & Emo it's awesome!  You'll need a guide such as Rick to show you around.  The Sturgeon spawning beside the rapids on Rainy River was great!  They have a sturgeon hatchery close by.  I'm planning to visit Lake of the Woods in early June & spend a few nights near Nestor Falls or Sioux Narrows.  Hopefully I'll have a few pix of the great walleye fishery this area is known for.  Imagine -  I'm also working here & getting paid for it!!  With great fishing 1/2 hour up the road."
