970835,Fishwilly,2016-05-24 11:01:00,206,The lakers were on in Wellington as well. We went 8-11. All nice size between 7-20 lbs. It seemed everyone was catching.

971019,BillM,2016-05-25 11:33:00,17367,they piss me off..... Better than a white stripe.....honestly I've never seen. Lakers aggressive as this. Anything went down and they smacked it .... We thought Kings were Mxed n and had the dipsies out 80 on a 3 and they would crush it.  Early season fishing on the southern shore    Great time to be on the water.
