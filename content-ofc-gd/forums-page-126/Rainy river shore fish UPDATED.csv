Anyhow, head down around 9am. Its already 16 and sunny, no wind. Water sure dropped though.  Few cast in started getting some dinks. Good fun though.  All the sudden MNR and Ontario gov shows up. We chat. Turns out the water drop shut off the sturgeon spawn. So I helped them out for 45 mins or so doing some rudimentary measuring etc. In turn thwy showed my some cool equipment to look at the eggs on bottom.  After we finished they stuck around and asked me to look for some bass. So I did. Caught a bunch of lil guys 12-14"", again, good fun. After a chat, off they went.  So I move from the rapids to a sandbar. Nice clear water. Lotsa follows on the white spinnerbait, big fish!.  Landed 2 around 32"" but man I had tons of follows right up to shore, including a few over 40"". Fun to watch but bummer they wouldnt bite. I tried alot of baits/lures with the same results.  So I just took a few naturd pics and chilled out. Beautiful day out!  Im heading back out around 6 and see if we can get some big bites with the kiddos.  Gotta try now because they are gonna open the gates and rais the water at least 97cm to try to get the sturgeon spawn going again.  A few pics. And hopefully more to come later?  All the bass were around this size    Old sturgeon net stakes now high and dry     Rainy river is not this clear very often!    Bike washed up with the driftwood during highwater during the start of spring     Nice set up spot    Always love the rapids!    Pelicans, they are right around where I had some big fish follows      The view up to RRFN    Nice view to the east of the river    Homesweet home!!!  Ill follow up pt. 2 tonight, hopefully with a few 30"" + pike!"

970260,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 00:09:00,11391,"Ck, ill have to ask my pops, hes in charge but i will let ya know! Thanks again btw!  OI, yep shes a beaut! My favorite place to fish or just chill out!  Pt 2 was pretty chill. I brought my brother in law, my youngest girl and oldest boy with.  We ended up heading out earlier than I wanted wife the wife having plans so...  A few pike, couple bite offs. Lost one really nice fish at shore right at the end of the day, grrrrr.  Was a beaut if an evening thought! Lotsa laughs, great scenery and just a relaxing good time?"
970268,ehg,2016-05-19 01:21:00,2666,Great post and photos MB2! Fishing reports are too rare on this fishing board. Thanks for this!  Had an aunt that lived in Stratton way back. Was real young when we did 24 hr. drive up there. The river was slow and milky there. It scared me as child i thought a sturgeon would pull me in the water.
970273,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 01:32:00,11391,"Thanks man! Just uploading some more pics from the second trip.  Stratton is right by us, farm town lol.  The river there is nuch dirtier than in manitou, its gotta lot of farm run off. Did ya ever watch the sturgeon jumpin at night as the sun goes down? Its amazing! Thousands of them!!!"

970285,chris.brock,2016-05-19 02:19:00,4053,"That's a big arse wolf.  I'm surprised how far along the trees are up there, the poplars have bigger leaves than Haliburton."
970286,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 02:32:00,11391,"Contnd...  Daddy daughter shot! Hahaha her zen like focus!     Nice one a holes.

970295,can u fish,2016-05-19 11:27:00,326,Awesome Rick thanks for the report and photos looks like a great time with the kids those sturgeon bring back a lot of memories when my grand father and I would fish for them in the Gatineau River in the Maniwaki Quebec area they were quite plentiful back then.  Cheers Mitch
970311,AKRISONER,2016-05-19 14:24:00,5558,"nice report, hopefully soon the fish will cooperate as well!"
970317,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 14:48:00,11391,"Thanks can u fish! Amazing fish to be around eh? Even just watching them is fun!  Thanks akr! It was too bad as I caught some cookie cutter bass earlier, maybe I shoulda took more fush pics lol.  Gonna head out here soon and try again before the water rises.  Wormdunker should be here tomorrow night so hopefully we can fish some walleye for opener on saturday!  I will for sure but if he cant I dont blame him as its a 20 hour drive at least lol"
970326,ehg,2016-05-19 16:38:00,2666,"Again, great stuff MB2! Your kids look pretty happy, best thing about fishing is making the kids happy."
970333,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 17:28:00,11391,Thanks ehg! Probably woulda looked happier but the sun is right in their eyes???  Time for some new specs?
970372,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 21:51:00,11391,"Tough conditions today! Water temps 59, 22km/h winds gusting to 36, from the south(or right into my face?)  Laying tobacco offering    Keeper?    Lotsa sturgeon visible today in the rapids. Look at that tail!     Nature selfie?    Fish on!    Not too long but pretty fat     Shoreline frogs are a good sign for walleye opener     And just as I got home I gotta txt. ""Made it to emo""!  So off I went to meet and greet with OFCs own wormdunker! Welcome to NW ontario bud!!!    Pretty good day. 7 pike. No big ones but good action. Ill take it"
970464,manitoubass2,2016-05-20 19:57:00,11391,  Current situation lol.  Shoulda brought the rain gear...  
970467,AKRISONER,2016-05-20 20:38:00,5558,"its not fishing unless its raining  correct me if I am wrong, but are you guys not under extreme fire danger at the moment anyways?"
970472,manitoubass2,2016-05-20 21:13:00,11391,Haha I hear ya! I love fishing in a down pour! I didnt bring any rain gear though because it was sunny and not a cloud in the sky haha. Well and I only had 2 hours to fish.  OPENER tomorrow!!!!  Yeah we need the rain. I think weve been under fire ban for about a month.  Its a wonder anything is growing its been so hot and dry.
970473,Rod Caster,2016-05-20 21:13:00,5784,Looks like you guys have that spot to yourselves. That's a big backyard
