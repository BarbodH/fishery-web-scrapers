We will have guests over between June 20 to June 30, and I am looking to rent a cottage for about 3 nights and take them fishing. Ideally it's within 3 hours of driving from GTA and has great fishing, quantity matters more than quality, species doesn't really matter, bass/walleye/musky or anything that might bite. I will be bring my own boat. Any advice will be appreciated!  "
970704,GBW,2016-05-23 01:55:00,8460,Lot's of resorts around that cater to what you are after in the Kawartha's and Haliburton Highlands area.

970727,Mister G,2016-05-23 12:37:00,1429,Look for resorts that offer American Plan where meals are included........3-4 nights are almost standard with these because of the cost. You should have no problem finding one. Now fish that bite is a bigger challenge.

I found a private 3 bedroom cottage on Pigeon Lake last year and stayed for a week with my family. Just reccomended it to a guy at work and he's taking it for a week this summer. Shoreline is shallow and rocky/gravel and not the best place for swimming, but there's a great beach just 10 min. away. It has it's own dock and the boat launch is right beside the cottage. Under $1000 for 7 days, no tax.  Just use the filter to narrow your choices."

970777,alexw,2016-05-23 22:05:00,74,Thanks to all for your replies. I realize that lots of cottages are requiring minimum of one week rental. But I will make a few calls and maybe more googling.
