With great friend of mine and the kids we started about 6am...by 8 we had 3 in the box but stoped marking them and bite died down. Time to go in search mode...much easier to do with a boat than on foot let me tell you. After numerous stops....some lost fish...many bumps...almost full tank of gas we got our full limit of 8 by 2pm....  Meegs did the catching. Depths were from 45 to 85 fow. Lots of flies after 10am.... Here are few shots from the day:        Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

970651,misfish,2016-05-22 15:53:00,29133,Well done Emil. Got me a couple first thing this morning.
