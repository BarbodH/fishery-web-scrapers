Like seriously???  Its winter, dont take a corner at 110km per hour.  Every single day  We have a corner here in town that is 30 kph. In the winter our roads are covered with solid ice. They don't use salt or sand on our roads because it just doesn't work. They use gravel. The gravel ends up migrating as people drive over the surface to the edges of the road. A few years ago one of our East coasters in his jacked up 4X4 didn't bother with the speed limits or the fact that the road was covered in ice and drove over the guard rail and did a bunch of damage to his vehicle. Well his wife sent in a letter to the paper about how the city was negligent and they should pay for the repairs. I sent in a response to her letter and you can pretty much guess what I had to say.  And FYI, you can still drive around the corner at a good speed if you're smart enough to know to put your passenger side tires on the built up gravel."

970540,LeafsFan,2016-05-21 15:48:00,19,"So another long weekend is upon us and the driving in Niagara is awful.  I have been lucky enough travel through most of the US and Canada with a previous job, and my current job puts in me into Alberta when I am working.  In Alberta I think I might have had to honk once or twice this year, but in Niagara I have had to honk every day to let people know HI I AM HERE.  Nowhere compares to how bad the driving seems to be getting in Niagara, give me NYC, Boston, San Fran, or Texas any day of the week.  Thankfully I only have to drive in Niagara for a week out of the month, maybe two weeks at most.  The following are violations I see every day (not including speeding). And the kicker now seems to be the e-bikes (AKA the ""I got busted for a DUI but still drive so HA"").  No license is required, no plates are needed, and no insurance is needed (to my understanding).  These bikes are becoming a menace in Niagara, since they lack proper lighting (I have to give it to cyclists, at least they put on proper lighting as a whole in Niagara).  I have seen people ride the e-bikes on the sidewalks, side of the road, and down the middle of the traffic lane (of which they have trouble maintaining 50 kilometers an hour).  Are any communities outside of Niagara experiencing the e-bikes issue or find driving is getting significantly worse?  I am at the point where I think red light cameras and speed cameras might actually be useful (as long as they are not setup like they have been in Alberta).  I will admit I used to be an awful driver when I first got my license, but after getting pulled over one night (10 years ago) where the cop was exceptionally kind (the $65 ticket was a massive sigh of relief), I made it my mission to be conscious of all traffic rules/regulations and to pay attention to speed limits."

LOL  I stopped driving around 5 years ago, MS, I decided it was beyond my abilities to do so safely. I do believe it is a problem everywhere though, in some areas more than others?  I live in a small rural township near a junction of two state highways, it has a one way traffic circle at the junction, only the north and south part have stop signs, none on the east and west part. People can't seem to read the stop signs or travel in the direction of the arrows?  Dirt bikes, 4 wheelers, and snowmobiles aren't allowed on our roads here, that doesn't seem to stop them, or keep them from taking off across some one Else's property if they see a cop.  There is no perfect world? You just hope not to injure or kill some one "" by accident ""?"

No signals when coming to a turn, tail-gaiting--I just took my foot of the gas and forced them to go around me, they were impatient anyway. Red light runners, people on bikes that ran stop signs and stop lights. I really detest those folks. Drivers that sit in your blind spot on the QEW,  dumb transport truckers that ride in the middle lane, why do they do that? Either pass or pull into the slow lane, that pisses me off. Huge concern for me is folks that continue to do the following, Drink coffee, apply make-up, talk on phone, texting, smoking with kids in the car, eating while driving, if you choke ,you deserve it. I could go on and on but I think you see the issue, don't be stupid when driving--. Pass the aspirin and pour me some Yukon Jack,  p.s. --Im not driving.  lol.."

Some are holding the phone right to their ear, yapping away with hundreds of other drivers watching them.  My son and I were on the 401 eastbound going towards Toronto last week in heavy traffic. One car ahead of us was leaving a large gap and I couldn't understand why at first. We watched the driver look down into her lap at least 10 times in a one minute span. I finally had enough and gave her a quick sound of the horn to let her know we were watching. She promptly gives us the single digit salute. We pull up beside her and she already has the window open, ready to say something. I yell,  "" GET OFF THE PHONE ! "" She calls ME an idiot, rolls up the window and goes about her business.  Umm, "" I'm the idiot ? """

Retirees in south Florida worse than most. Parking your car in a Wall Mart parking lot there is a quick way to get dinged.  I saw them all today. Drove from north of Parry Sound to St. Kitts today then over to Haldimand. It got worse the closer we got to T.O. Ferraris and crotch rockets weaving in and out of traffic and all makes of bikes creating their personal laneways during jam ups from 69 to the QEW, and there were plenty. Why is it traffic comes to a stop when someone is parked on the side of the highway? Nothing to see here kids, move along.

I have had a couple older people surprise me with the stupid antics on the road though, I leave a 2-3 car gap when driving on the QEW in traffic (doing 70-90) and I had some guy rip it up beside me flailing his arms then get in front of me and continue, he then give me the finger, I proceeded to move over into the slow lane and pass him by and gave him a wave to which he then gave me the finger again and I could just laugh.

A good 60 to 70 percent do not come to a complete stop at stops signs just slow down and roll through. Red light, turning right I don't have to stop if its clear seems to be the latest, seeing lots of this. But the Number one problem here is tourist and there GPS's. People but so much dam blind faith in these that they never look at a real map, so they do not have a frigging clue were they are going just when to turn left or right when the box tells them to. See it all the time cutting across multiple lanes to make the turn or cut off at the last second. People please just look at a map before your trip and get an idea in your head were and how you are going. We actually have higher insurance rates because of all the tourist driving in are area."

We just need to learn from the mistakes we've made; but I do agree that these lessons seem to be hard for some to learn. I believe stronger fines are in order and not just monetary; but mandatory class room time and driving sessions with a trainer.
