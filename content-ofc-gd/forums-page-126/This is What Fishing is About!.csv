Monday was a day that hopefully sets my daughter up for a future in the outdoors! I asked her if she would like to go fishing with me, she said yes, and hurried off to get ready.  We headed off to Gagnons to first get some worms, then up to Heber Downs CA to fish the pond.  She was at first turned off on the idea that worms were fish food, saying thats disgusting! but after explaining that fish love to eat them, she came around to the idea and was not affraid to at least look at them.  We had some hits, and some misses. and even something I have never caught before. But it all doesn't matter, because the excitement in her voice was the biggest thrill of all.  She didn't think too fondly of this catfish, even though every time i go out on my own she asks me to catch a catfish!    If the catfish wasn't enough to freak her out, this sure did the trick, especially when it let go and landed right in front of us.    She then found something she could handle!    And the thrill of all summed up in 14 seconds of pure joy! Video Link"

Caught bullheads and sunfish and was forever hooked on fishing. When about 9 he took me to Claremont park Pickering headwaters of Duffin's Creek caught my first brook trout , still into Lake O headwater creek brookies... Your kids should always remember!"
