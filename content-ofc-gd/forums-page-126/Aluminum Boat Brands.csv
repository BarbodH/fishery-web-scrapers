Much thicker aluminum then what you get on the popular heavily marketed brands. A good used one can save you 10 grand on the price and it will sell last a lifetime.  I know where you can get a nice 30' Duckworth cheap. This was yesterday in Alaska. Someone pulled in front of the driver and he swerved to avoid. The rest is history.  "

970405,35Wailin,2016-05-20 03:57:00,59,"+1 for cretliner.  I have a '99 utility with bench seats and a split rear.  It is one tough boat.  It is stable in the water, I can stand on one corner of the transom and the boat barely rocks.  I had my motor on lock by accident and hit a semi submerged log.  The only damage was a wrinkle in the splash well.  It is all welded of 100 gauge aluminum with a 20 year hull weld warranty, but I haven't needed it yet.  She gets used and abused and comes back for more.  She's hauled anglers and hunters.  Camping gear for back country trips and deer back out.  I've spilled deer, waterfowl and fish bodily fluids and all it takes is a good rinse with the hose to clean her out after.  I just slapped a new 25 Yammie on her last spring and she'll do 28 mph with two people and our gear.  She's rated for a 40, but I think that would be too fast, especially if I was alone.  25 is lots, besides, a 40 would probably troll too fast."

Without getting in to chevy vs ford debate, Regardless of size, all boats have their limitations, rivets will leak and welds will crack if you beat the crap out of it, same goes for the motor and trailer, Take care of your equipment, drive according to conditions and it will last a long time."
935231,Steve,2015-09-19 16:23:00,2075,"when I did my boat overhaul in 2011, i looked at carpetless floor.  i decided with the 12 month a year fishing i do, carpet is 100% the way to go.  but I know I'm in the minority on this one.....I'm not a clean freak...carpet reduces slippery surfaces in the cold, and keep the floor cooler in the heat."
935482,craigdritchie,2015-09-20 23:10:00,1586,"I'm of two minds where carpet goes. On one hand I agree with Steve, I like the extra traction, especially once you get some slime on the deck. But it holds water like a sponge, and it never really comes clean. I like the durability of vinyl, but it can get pretty slippery after you've put a couple of fish on it, especially if you're fishing for lakers or pike.  Has anyone tried using snap-in carpet on their fishing boat? I know it's very popular on runabouts and bowriders ... the carpet attaches to the floor on a series on metal snaps, so you can haul it out in a few seconds to dry the boat out after a rain, or to give it a thorough cleaning at the end of the year. And once it gets really badly chewed up, it's a lot less fuss to replace than a traditional glued-in carpet floor.  It seems like a good alternative for a fishing boat. Anyone have any practical experience with it on a fishing rig?"

He says the same (which is nice to know). For some reason they don't seem to be as strong a seller in Canada as the US, but if you look around on some of the US sites and see how many 20, 30 year old Starcrafts are sill going strong, that speaks for itself imo.

934923,craigdritchie,2015-09-17 23:21:00,1586,"Nothing wrong with a Legend, but as others have said, they compete on price by advertising the boat with a smaller engine. By the time you upgrade to a larger engine, the price tends to fall in line with everyone else.  What would I buy? Starcraft - hands down. Don't even have a second choice. They're well designed, well built, nothing rattles or vibrates, and they're just about indestructable. The Hydra-Lift hull design on most of the fishing models will go into shallow water for bass, yet still eat big waves i open water. That's why so many of the die-hard walleye guys on Erie use them.  Beyond that, Starcraft has been building boats since 1903. You don't stay in any business for 112 years (and counting) by making a crappy product, or by not taking care of your customers."

They've all been really good although at 16 years old, I'm going to have to replace a piece of flooring in the Rebel 16SC i'm running right now.  I think thats pretty fair as the rest of the boat is tight and doesn't leak, although its sporting a fair bit of dock rash, no big deal.  My 14 footer is a starcraft SF14 and it is a solid little craft that I was doing everything out of before, but now just hunting and smaller waterbodies, can't compare it to its bigger brothers, but quality is still there.  The new starcrafts that I've seen make me drool, and If I was spending 25-35k on a new boat, I'd likely buy one and be done with it. I'm not a bass fisherman, so thats not an issue."

Lund is always my top choice for a tinner, top quality aluminum double riveted seams and well thought out storage and ergos about best resale, and good dry ride, alumacraft next in line, starcraft i ve seen all been great, and the sylvan/smokercrafts take a beating and stay leak free,  all boats are a trade off somewhere, the widebody stuff from lund, sylvan legend all tend to give you more room with a wider beam and flatter bottom more pounding less cutting all things to consider, ranger has a couple intresting aluminum boats, havn't read anything negative but really only kow a couple guys with them"

It is next to impossible.  I bought the Xpedition 17 (dual side console) with the Pro XS OptiMax new off the lot.  It had immediate issues, and consequently the service we received from Princecraft was terrible.  Don't get me wrong, I love the product and its overall quality, but their service ... wow.  I have hopes that they are reading this.  I am still haunted by the disappointing experiences to this day.  I had expressed every issue in a very respectful and professional manner, but they chose to ignore my polite submissions, both phone calls and emails.  The issues mainly came down to workmanship; many of the buttons studs for the top where tapped in the wrong locations, electrical problems at the dash, dealership confusions with orders, and instant motor problems (Mercs responsibility not Princecraft).  Some issues were isolated at the dealership level, but Princecraft failed on their Customer Satisfaction platform.  When their service center tells a customer that they are aware of the problem, but don't currently know how to deal with it, leads me to believe they aren't lending any confidence to their customers.  I gave up on Princecraft to a point where I didn't even tell them how I 'honestly' felt about them, and the issues are still outstanding after three years.  I don't want to go through that again.  You would expect a company of their reputation to be on their game.  Not sure what happened, but I hope that I am the only customer who had these experiences.  I also hope that they have improved over the last few years, because they do make a great product.  Dealing with Merc was great.  Princecraft, not so much.  Just my 2 cents ..."

Not a drop of water after 16 days and during two of them it rained and then evaporated in the 26C temps. Never bailed it. Now I couldn't say that before I reset every rivet in 2005!  It's a crap shoot but it seems that the guys have nailed it down pretty good already. My 2007 Lund doesn't leak a drop, has ZERO corrosion and the paint still looks like the day it came out of the factory. It's not a garage queen, it's tied to a dock and in the water for 5+ straight months and then used in late fall (breaking ice if need be) for Musky fishing on a sometimes very mean Georgian Bay (I've shown Terry how to ride 10' swells on the crest!). It runs ""dry"" through heavy seas, etc but as others have noted the new Lund stuff being built doesn't seem as well produced, although I wouldn't dismiss them as a possibility. I had my head in some 1725's just yesterday helping at the marina. Not sure where I would turn if I was looking current day, but Legend and Tracker would be nowhere on my list."

Not a leak, original paint and pin-striping still looks great, all flooring vinyl and carpet still fully intact, bilge and livewell are the original, never have replaced a fuse, wire, or anything.  Even all but one of the snaps for the cover are original and still holding strong in the track.  Here it is looking perfect last week on it's second trip to Nipigon this year.

Boats like vehicles, the home, skidoo, trailer, cottage, etc., are big purchases.  Just as much an investment as anything else, and unless you're so totally loaded you can throw money away, you protect all your investments. Those screws two or three times a year all get checked and tightened, especially before and after long road trips. The wiring below the splash well gets cleaned out when the bottom of the boat and bilge gets spray cleaned too.  The boat inside and outs gets a couple washes a year, with wax.  The carpets scrubbed of blood and dirt and extra mats cleaned too.  Boots and shoes covered in sand and mud while camping, get washed before stepping in then wiped on the mat, cause who needs that crap getting below the flooring to hold moisture, mildew and cause corrosion. This and more is all simple stuff, simple as covering the boat when not in use.  I know too many guys that wouldn't even consider one of these things to do in a years time...  For some though, it's second nature and not even a chore at all.  Your boat will thank you as it ages gracefully."

As always, try to get as close to the Max HP the hull was designed for and you will be happy.  If I were to buy a deep v boat, the two I gravitate to are Lund and Crestliner. There are other boats out there of the same quality but these are the best boats I have to choose from in my area."
934835,MrSimon,2015-09-17 13:48:00,217,"From what I've seen, Legend is kind of middle of the pack.  I'm a really big fan of Alumacraft.  I feel you can get Lund level quality at slightly better prices.  I also like G3 boats, but they are hard to find the further North you go.  Even if it seems that a used boat is hard to find .... it can really be worth it to keep looking.  With some patience, you can usually find a set up you like at a LOT less than brand new prices."
934839,AKRISONER,2015-09-17 14:15:00,5558,"after riding around in my friend's smokercraft, ill never buy one...the thing feels like you are getting in a car crash with every ripple you hit."
934840,Craigson,2015-09-17 14:17:00,117,Legends are guaranteed for life. 0.100 gauge hull.
934849,Cosmos,2015-09-17 15:08:00,588,Alumacraft would be my choice any day. Lund is second.
934855,John Bacon,2015-09-17 15:40:00,3277,"Legend doesn't actually make boats.  They outsource the manufacturing to other companies (usually Smokercraft).  I think they may do a little of their own trim work; but they do not manufacture their own hulls.  I don't think that they are too bad of a boat; but usually way under powered.  Before buying a Legend check to see what the same boat would cost from the original manufacturer.  Trackers are often nicknamed ""crackers"" because many people have had issues with hulls cracking.  I am happy so far with my 2008 Princecraft Holiday DLX so far.  Princecraft is made in Canada so there may be a price advantage compared to U.S. made boats once the 2016 prices comeout."
934867,lew,2015-09-17 17:21:00,12766,"  Trackers are often nicknamed ""crackers"" because many people have had issues with hulls crackin  I was up on Nipissing last month and the OPP towed a Tracker into our camp after the guy hit a rock. Busted the bottom of the boat wide open like a pop can but it stayed afloat with no trouble. I was actually impressed with how well if floated with the gunnels still well above water even after the boat was towed about 5 miles  I'd imagine any boat would have split the same though after hitting that rock.  Felt sorry for the folks that owned that boat though, they'd only just bought it brand new a week before and had just put it in the water for the 1st time 3 days before the crash."
934869,Gerritt,2015-09-17 17:25:00,6129,Hopefully insured for the replacement cost Lew..... Sad indeed.
934870,landry,2015-09-17 17:25:00,1005,IMO 1. Alumacraft 2. Lund 3. Crestliner (I own one and it's been great) Last place  - Tracker Max or darn close to max HP
934873,lew,2015-09-17 17:38:00,12766,"Hopefully insured for the replacement cost Lew..... Sad indeed.  Yeah, he insured it before they headed north but your right Gerritt, it was really sad, I talked to him and his wife quite a bit afterwards and they were really upset about it all, brand new boat destroyed and a vacation they'd waited all year for ruined."
934874,dave524,2015-09-17 17:43:00,4508,"I personally prefer , especially if it is to be used on big water, a few of the Starcraft lineup. I would not own a light gauge ( under .125 inch thickness)  welded aluminum boat."
934877,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-17 17:55:00,8243,"1st choice StarCraft because I own one and it's tougher than all hell. We fish Erie and it does well for an aluminum out there in 1 meter waves. She gets up on plane very well. 2nd Crestliner, they look solid 3rd Lund Tracker, never.  If someone gave me a Tracker I'd take the engine off and give what they call a boat away to someone I don't particularly like very well. We were looking at them at Bass Pro in NOTL. Man what a piece of crap. There were actually welds that looked like an apprentice did after learning to weld on-line. Actually had passes that were not closed, and these are the boats they choose to be shown. It had rained and the storage compartments had an inch of water in them. Sorry Legend owners but facts are facts."
934878,Cast-Away,2015-09-17 17:55:00,790,"I have owned a Legend since 2001 and got a great end of season deal on it having been watching for a deal. I bought at the time after a lot of research for two years and found most boats other than Lund to be of a similar quality at that time in the size I was looking for. It was 17' to 18' with 75hp to 90hp. Lund was out of my price range so they were off the table. In the end I picked the Legend because it had the best interior layout at the time for my taste.  Having owned the boat for 14 years now, I would not buy another one unless the quality has improved from what I currently have. Many of the screws in and around the dashboard and cockpit area have either come loose or fallen out many times and had to get put back in by me. I replaced what I could with nuts, bolts and lockwashers. Now in the last two years the decals are starting to curl up and fall off on the outside of the hull and they are no longer made. Bare metal is showing because the entire hull was not painted before the decals were applied. To me that is a shortcut. Some of the paint on the back of the transom is now bubbling up as well.  If I did it all over again, I would only buy a Lund. I go on GBay a fair bit and a decent deep V is a must."
934880,Raf,2015-09-17 17:58:00,3495,"starcraft, alumacraft and lund would be at the top of my list from what i've seen.  i own a mirrocraft."
934881,lew,2015-09-17 18:04:00,12766,My last boat was a 1650 Crestliner which I bought new in '99.  I drove it for about 9 years then sold it to a buddy who's still driving it today and it's still in great shape.
934898,MrSimon,2015-09-17 20:24:00,217,"While I do agree there is a difference in hull quality across brands .... I personally only care if the hull is dry, has the layout/size I want, and is inexpensive.  I think buying a new hull is a waste of money.  The motor on the other hand ... I'll gladly pay up for a quality motor that runs great and is the max allowable HP.  Motor problems are WAY WAY more prevalent on the water than hull problems."
934901,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-17 20:40:00,10439,"I purchased my boat through Legend in the spring of 1991 and am very happy with it. Even after 24 years!!! As has been said, they do not manufacture their own boats but re badge other manufacturers units. Mine is actually a Fisher SV-18 GT. I made sure to upsize the motor when I purchased it. Probably the best thing about my boat is the floor. It is carpeted aluminium so there is no plywood to rot like there is on most boats out there. The only wood on my boat is the core of the transom and two teak trim pieces on the gunnel and splashwell."
934902,captpierre,2015-09-17 20:44:00,2521,Chatted with a CO on Nippising years ago after being checked. He had a  worn 19 ft Crestliner and Yammy combo. Said they  beat it up pretty good in the big water. No problems. Says a lot to me.
934903,Dan668,2015-09-17 20:45:00,1120,"Alumacraft, Starcraft, Princecraft, Crestliner, all make good hulls. A friend owns a legend, no issues, just be sure to upsize the motor closer to max. I currently have a newer Lund, but its had its fair share of issues mainly related to the hull and finishing itself surprisingly. Not sure if this is common amongst the others within the past 5 years but kind of disappointing considering the cost of these rigs."
934905,grimsbylander,2015-09-17 20:48:00,3016,This is great info guys. Very much appreciated! Finding a boat will be the tricky part now. He'll buy in the fall with no issues so that's good.
934906,Sinker,2015-09-17 21:13:00,8692,Im a starcraft fan. Ive had mine for 20 years with no issues at all with the hull. Doesnt leak a drop.  S.
