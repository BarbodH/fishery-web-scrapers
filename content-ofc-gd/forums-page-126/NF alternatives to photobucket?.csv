970370,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-19 21:35:00,10439,If you're on Facebook you can easily import your pics from Photobucket. I post most of my pics to FB and then copy the image address to post to forums using img code.
970373,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 21:56:00,11391,I can import to photobucket no prob.  It crashes when im trying to post and its slow as heck compared to before.  Might just be my phone too as it crashed when I was out fishing today. My phone just turned off and I couldnt use it at all. Then it miraculously started working the minute I got home and plugged it in(while at 46% batter life???)

970379,BillM,2016-05-19 22:44:00,17367,"It's probably your phone, not Photobucket."
970381,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 22:55:00,11391,"Well tbh, my phone is having issues.  But even on my old phone I was starting to have issues with photobucket.  Meh, it is what it is.  Probably should just spend a day importing all my pics off my phone and to a hardrive"
970384,BillM,2016-05-19 23:25:00,17367,"You could try uninstalling the app then reinstalling.  If that fails, use something like IMGUR, etc."
970385,manitoubass2,2016-05-19 23:29:00,11391,Good idea  Thanks bill?

970392,LeafsFan,2016-05-20 01:25:00,19,"I would put a vote behind IMGUR, I like the basic-ness of the interfaces and the general clean look of the site (and very little, if any, advertising)."
970627,manitoubass2,2016-05-22 04:05:00,11391,"          Just a test. Billm you were correct. Uninstalled it,reinstalled it and its now working fine? thanks"
