970675,Fisherman,2016-05-22 19:24:00,7201,"Lily of the Valley,  pick the flowers and place in a small shot glass with water, very nice smell."
970693,dave524,2016-05-22 22:23:00,4508,"Yes , definitely Lily of the Valley, it can be invasive spreading underground by runners, I'm still trying to get rid of some because of the dogs as it is poisonous."
970696,aplumma,2016-05-22 22:29:00,6896,Very nice lily of the valley. I have them planted on the farm they smell fantastic when blooming. Ther than that they are a green leafy plant that spreads underground.   art
970729,Spiel,2016-05-23 12:52:00,9065,Thanks guys. I I have them in the back yard and yes they spread like crazy.
971022,Garry2Rs,2016-05-25 12:11:00,1425,"I have them too.  I have seen dogs eat grass, but none of my dogs, or any visiting dogs, have ever shown any interest in these plants."
971025,DanD,2016-05-25 12:42:00,2223,"Our neighbor's cat is no longer with us, after it decided to taste the lilly's in our back yard.  Pretty sad really, it was only a couple of minutes after it ate the plant; that the cat was on its side paddling with foam coming out of its mouth. The cat only lasted an hour or so after getting it to the vet.  Dan."
