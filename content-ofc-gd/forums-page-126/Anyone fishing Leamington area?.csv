I think you morning guys must have caught them all because it was dead that direction after supper.  We did find a few half way out the point though in 32-34 fow so it wasn't a total bust.  Didn't appear to be much happening there this morning either but again, we managed a few more for supper."

970786,spincast,2016-05-24 00:34:00,3279,"We got 14 West leamington harbour today. that was you huh?   heard a couple boats found the right spots. It was a narrow band from what we saw 1t7 FOW or bust., and the winds made for some tough boat control  - crazy current, based on where my boards were running, But I have never seen 5Lbs of walleye disappear as fast as those 2 13 year olds ate Saturdays catch  the whole farm came out to play for us   G got a 6 lb sheepie as well, bit we'll pass on the pix - was a bleeder.... We found a nice warn spot Sunday and managed a couple to bring home.  Next couple of weeks and we should be prime time"
