It was a very long and busy day.. Over the course of the day, we would catch smallies, walleye, and, the target of the day, silvers. Made several donations to the river gods on the rocks, but the fishing was great for every one except the daughter's fiance. Guess he'll be on pink glove duty for the next little while. Pity we had to go home the same day ."

How do you compare the silvers to other fish, as for eating Bruce? Temperate bases definitely have a different taste. Somewhat stronger than perch/walleye.  Key to mellowing out the flavour is the same for cats. Bleed them, cut out the blood line, soak in milk.  The bite was not super fantastic, but the fish were there. Even better, no white perch, and all bigger fish."
