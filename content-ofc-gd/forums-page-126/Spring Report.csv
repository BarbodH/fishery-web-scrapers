Its been a colder then normal spring here with a lot of rain. I have been fishing with the kids a lot and they have caught many new personal best fish including carp, channel and flat head carp and largemouth bass. We had a lot of fun and most of our fish were let go.  This is my personal best flathead catfish. She was caught on a 1/16 ounce shad dart with 6lb line. Put up a crazy fight and took me about 20 minutes to land.    This was my daughter's personal best flathead. She caught this on some corn bottom fishing for carp.    This is my son's personal best channel catfish he caught on a small shad dart. He was struggling to hold the thing up. It put up a nice fight in the current.    Another channel cat caught on a 2 inch twister tail jig.     This is my son's biggest bass that we caught this spring. She was caught while we were fishing for crappie with a 1"" gulp minnow on 4lb fine. It was an intense battle and we were able to land it! We let it go after a quick couple of pics. We don't have a bass season down here.    I'm helping him hold the fish for perspective. .  Another nice bass on a 1"" gulp while crappie fishing.     We also caught some nice shad! This was the biggest one that we landed this season. Nice american shad!       We also caught some nice carp too on shad darts and light line!  This one weighed 23lb and it was a long battle that we won!        We also caught some nice crappie too!      My first spring smallie. It was nice to get out on the creek!  "
