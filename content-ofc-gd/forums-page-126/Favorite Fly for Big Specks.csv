970191,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 15:39:00,29,Waste of time.  Learned a lesson about sharing anything in this community.  Thanks for the wonderful welcome.  Hope you are all proud of yourselves.
970195,Brettiop,2016-05-18 15:52:00,279,"Very possible he just tied a fly, it worked, and he wanted to share...  Sure he probably got inspiration from pictures on the internet, but don't we all?  I truly don't think he meant to rip off the sex dungeon, if he knew all about it he would have to have know others would call him out on it..."
970200,Salmonidstalker,2016-05-18 16:33:00,265,I second this. Lol. A think of few of these guys need to get a life.
970202,cuzza,2016-05-18 16:45:00,467,"My go-to is the zuddler in one colour or another, always have olive, black and white with me, they catch almost anything. Might have to try yellow by the sounds of things too    The trouble with these complex, time consuming articulated flies is that when casting them against far banks and under trees, you lose them. Well, I do anyway"
970203,bare foot wader,2016-05-18 16:48:00,1354,"I don't doubt the OP tied up a pattern of his own creation, that fly has a lot of good attributes and easy to see why it's productive...claiming to ""invent"" a new fly pattern nowadays is a bold statement, but especially more so with this pattern as Galloup has almost a cult like following for his streamers  don't take too much offence, fly guys are typically a feisty bunch...you should see how the spey guys react when they catch ya swinging a little tiny Colorado blade with no fur/feathers LOL"
970207,wallacio,2016-05-18 16:51:00,475,"I second this. Lol. A think of few of these guys need to get a life.  LOL please, my responses were pretty measured compared to the kind of reception the original post would receive on an actual fly tying/fishing forum.   Classy with the name calling too, not unexpected though."

970210,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 17:08:00,29,Nice fly.  Now I am really probably going to further irritate some fly fisherman by sharing that I fish my articulated fly on a spinning rod.  I never use it on a fly rod for the same reason cuzza points out.  I am much better able to control my cast with a spinning rod.
970211,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 17:12:00,29,"LOL please, my responses were pretty measured compared to the kind of reception the original post would receive on an actual fly tying/fishing forum.   Classy with the name calling too, not unexpected though.  Thanks for the warning!!  I won't hold hard feelings on my part with you.  I can see where you are coming from.  I'll add this to my list of adult learning moments.  In my case, the entries on that list don't get any less frequent as I have aged."
970213,wallacio,2016-05-18 17:18:00,475,Fair enough Huronmtn.  Good fishing!

970218,wallacio,2016-05-18 17:36:00,475,"Speaking of being presumptuous...I'm far from an elitist fly-only angler.   I do love fly fishing but actually enjoy and participate in all forms of angling.    Again, I simply took exception to someone claiming to have invented a fly which is virtually identical to a well known pattern."

970226,wallacio,2016-05-18 19:44:00,475,The Dungeon is definitely gets big Trout...a sampling of the ones I've taken on it since the season opened a few weeks ago:            The Conehead Zuddler that Cuzza posted is also a favourite of mine for smaller creeks/smaller fish.
970227,Dara,2016-05-18 19:51:00,3052,"ferget the fly fishing,"
970229,wallacio,2016-05-18 20:01:00,475,"Heh, Galloup has some great names for his streamers...the Barely Legal, Tips Up, Pearl Necklace..."
970394,Joeytier,2016-05-20 01:39:00,3990,"Ehhh, it all got settled like big boys are supposed to, a nice ending.  My 'fly-fishing' pretty well only consists of trolling a full sink 6 wt in the spring for specks/lakers, but I've yet to find a more productive pattern around here than straight black bead-head woolly buggers, usually size 6.  I can never seem to get the brookies onto a good streamer bite (the lakers will chomp them though)."
970097,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 01:55:00,29,"Do you have a ""go to"" productive Speck fly that has proven itself over the years/decades?  Care to share?  Mine is a fly I invented/refined after a mix of experiences that led me to create this pattern.  I call it the ""ScuCraLee"".  It is a somewhat complex fly to tie but worth the effort if you are focused on big Specks.  It can be fished to simulate either a sculpin, crayfish, or leech.  See my video if you want to give it a try.  https://youtu.be/1YHJMSVtFX8"
970147,wallacio,2016-05-18 11:30:00,475,A nice tie but that is clearly a modified Galloup's Sex Dungeon...at least give credit to the actual innovator behind the pattern before claiming it as your own.
970148,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 11:42:00,29,
970149,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 11:48:00,29,"Wallicio,  Unfortunately I am not a fly tying affectionado as you are presuming.  I developed this fly on my own based on experience I had starting out fishing with unarticulated flies of my own tie and using jointed rapalas.  I don't subscribe to the precedent that one must study other fly tyiers work before one sits down to tie a fly.  I do what makes sense based on my experience."
970151,wallacio,2016-05-18 12:00:00,475,"Right, you just happened to come up with a pattern (on your own) that almost exactly matches probably the most well known and most popular modern streamer fly today?  https://www.slideinn.com/product/galloups-sex-dungeon/  "
970155,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 12:20:00,29,
970157,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 12:25:00,29,"Ok.  Let me be much more diplomatic than I feel right now.  I started this topic with the hopes of sharing useful information between people interested in trophy Speck fishing.  I did not expect my first reply, or any replies, to be a complaint about what I wanted to share.  It is sad when vanity and arrogance ruins things for others trying to have a substantive exchange.  GTH"
970159,BillM,2016-05-18 12:30:00,17367,"Sweet Sex Dungeon, big browns also love these."
970161,wallacio,2016-05-18 12:48:00,475,"Lol. Vain and arrogant is slightly modifying someone else's pattern and claiming that you ""invented"" it."
970164,BillM,2016-05-18 13:16:00,17367,"That's actually my fly, I called it 'The Bill'"
970166,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 13:23:00,29,"So, you must be quite a chap.  Calling someone that you don't know a liar because you have some other fly tying knowledge in your head is appalling to me.  I guess you have appointed yourself the fly tying taxonomy God on this forum.  Good for you.  I hope that role brings you and others a lot of value in life.  Enough said on this. It would be nice if some one would reply with a fly they would like to share."
970167,BillM,2016-05-18 13:40:00,17367,Can you just admit you copied the Galloup fly?  Then we can all move on.
970172,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 14:01:00,29,i don't understand why this is such an issue for you.  Why are you more interested in what something is called instead of sharing what works?  You guys must know it all already and so this is really boring for you and this is how you find entertainment.  What I have to admit is that I have naively stepped into the world of fly tying snobbery.  I'll let you all have the last reply.  I have nothing else to say.  I am moving on.
970173,wallacio,2016-05-18 14:08:00,475,"The issue really has to be spelled out for you?    Would you be ok with your son submitting someone else's work at school with his name on it?   It's called plagiarism or more bluntly, ripping off someone else's hard work and passing it off as your own.    Had you just acknowledged that you modified a pre-existing pattern then all would be good."
970176,fish_finder,2016-05-18 14:26:00,370,"I'll share my favourite trophy trout fly.  I've been using the same pattern for a few years now.  Big browns, brookies and bows all like to kill it for trespassing.  Sometimes they like yellow, sometimes white, sometimes brown, sometimes black.....            Its called the sex dungeon, originally tied by a fella from the midwest.  Goes by the name Kelly Galloup."
970177,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 14:37:00,29,"So, an analogy to show you how stupid I think this is.  Let's assume you are a home builder.  One that actually has some design skills.  You design a custom split level home and offer the design to your clients along with many stock models.  You decide to call it what you want, some name with good marketing fluff attributes would be the typical thing to do.  Your rational applied to home building is that this builder can not offer his design to the market with out first publicly paying tribute to the first guy or gal that designed a split level home.  Who would even know that?  Who would even care?  Makes no sense.  Doesn't matter.  Clients like the house, clients buy and dwell in the house.  They don't a year or more later sit back and remember or care what the builder's design was called.  They just are happy with their choice and that the home fits their needs."
970178,AKRISONER,2016-05-18 14:39:00,5558,  this is an incredible photo
970179,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 14:40:00,29,
970180,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 14:41:00,29,Thanks for sharing Fishfinder.  I agree that the flies look very similar.  Looks like it works well for you.
970182,BillM,2016-05-18 14:49:00,17367,"So, an analogy to show you how stupid I think this is.  Let's assume you are a home builder. One that actually has some design skills.

Dude, you used the word INVENTED..  Are you really this stupid?  lol   If you simply would have said 'Hey guys, I love Galloups Sex Dungeon, here's my spin on it, it works great!'  this thread would have turned out completely different.  But you didn't, and you got called out and now you're back pedaling."
970183,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 15:11:00,29,Never heard of that fly before you pointed it out.  I admit they are similar designs.  If you don't believe that I guess you don't.
970186,Huronmtn,2016-05-18 15:20:00,29,It is probably hard to tie a fly nowadays that doesn't look like something someone else has tied before.  I am not out looking for any credit for inventing something.  I just wanted to share what I developed and found to work.  I didn't know there was a stern ethic with some -- an unwritten copyright law -- regarding fishing flies.  The fact that there was a design similar to the fly I shared prior to me sharing it is apparent. I didn't mean to take away from the work of others.  It is a good design in my experience that has worked very well for me.  I encourage anyone that has not used it to give it a try.
