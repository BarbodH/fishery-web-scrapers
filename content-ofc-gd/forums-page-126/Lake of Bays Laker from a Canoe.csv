The only boat I had up there was a canoe so I threw it in and did some jigging for Lakers. Got out on the water for about an hour on Friday afternoon with no luck. Saturday morning with coffee and Bailey's in hand, I hit up the same spot I had success at through the ice this Feb. Caught this beauty within 15 minutes! Just shy of 8lbs and beautiful colouring!  On Sunday I went and picked up my new 14' Legend widebody so now I have that for fishing the lake.  Great weekend!  https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4088FC4D6E65BB92!2168&authkey=!ACYkNSwMP-fqAgI&ithint=album%2c"
