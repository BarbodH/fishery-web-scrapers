The bugs were getting pretty thick out there by then so we took a run the other way.  Managed this cute Laker in about 55', 23' down of the rigger, using a Delta Flashline (I love those things!) and a RAC spoon (I helped reel and was the net man) my daughter took the pic, and I got to hold the fish since it was too big for her!
