970444,netminder,2016-05-20 17:10:00,514,"Were you afraid of the government coming and taking everything from you when you were younger? If not, what has changed? Is it because you don't like these new whippersnapper politicians and their ideas on things you don't understand? I honestly want to know, because I'm leaning towards agreeing with ehg here.  I can only imagine what it must be like to be someone your age, considering how much technology and society has changed in the past 60+ years. My best frame of reference for what things were like in the 50's and 60's are shows like Mad Men and stories about the Korean War and Vietnam War. I'm amazed at how much technology has evolved even in my lifetime and I'm only 30. I'm probably the last generation (in Canada anyway) who will remember rotary phones (or even home phones for that matter) instead of relying solely on cell phones, recording shows on VHS instead of PVR, going to the library to look something up instead of looking up google on my cell phone, having to subsist with 3 channels on TV and not 1,000 (none of which are showing anything worthwhile watching) or having to call or visit friends instead of just texting them. The next generation isn't going to know a world without the internet, and if all my friends are consistent, never going to know a world where no one sees their baby pictures because they've been plastered all over Facebook. I don't even know where my baby pictures are! And to think how the world must have changed since when you were a kid.  I was doing some math the other day because my grandfather is turning 75 this year. That means he was 45 when I was born. No one has children that young anymore, let alone grandchildren (at least on purpose, as far as I know).  When you look back on your frame of reference as to how fast you perceive time to travel as you age, and considering technology evolves at an exponential rate, I can't blame old-timers for being afraid of change. But I'm almost 100% certain that no one is coming to take your things, no matter how weird or backwards it seems to have a female lesbian premier, and some young buck PM who wants to legalize marijuana and all other sorts of weird and progressive things.  Just ride the wave and enjoy life. You're too old to be stressed about stuff."
970453,Joeytier,2016-05-20 18:06:00,3990," Also, do you really think the Ontario liberals are reforming election spending laws to monopolize their leadership?  Give me a break.  If anything, it will mean unions like the one I belong to will be further restricted as to how they can spend on campaign ads, and how many  corporate donations a party can accept during a campaign.  Does that really sound unfair to you?"

970460,davew3,2016-05-20 19:01:00,430,"Well from what I see,  we may not be the ones taken but the next generation will be.  I will be 56 soon.   I have watched the Libs close down the only coal plant that stayed on during the last big power out.  Now if were to happen again there will be no power. I hope they have all the bugs fixed.  I have seen them install smart meters with out our consent and have seen houses burn down because of them.  I seen them waste BILLIONS shutting down a gas plant build just to save some seats in the Mississauga riding.  I see this year a 4 % increase on basic rates.  Sure wish my wages went up by 4 %  http://www.ontario-hydro.com/  Hell they had to get the money from somewhere to pay off the teachers union.  My wife and I use our power according to the peak time chart they sent everyone (by the way it changed this month, but I will get back to that.) so my wife and I save money by using the hydro the way the gov wants us to and what happens?  They are not making enough of a profit.  They are not losing money.  Their profits are down so they cannot write themselves their big performance bonuses.  Hell also they had to get the money from somewhere to pay off the teachers union.  If you haven't received your new time of use notices in the mail you can go online.  They extended the peak times.  I am glad I am moving into a new high efficiency house soon. I pray my hydro bills go down.  Good luck to everyone"

And Cliff, the ""old"" comment wasn't pertaining to you one bit young fella!

If anything, it will mean unions like the one I belong to will be further restricted as to how they can spend on campaign ads, and how many corporate donations a party can accept during a campaign. Does that really sound unfair to you?  I think the point the people doing fishing reports here are saying is they are tired of these political diatribes about burning like a witch liberal lesbian premiers for fun. Like one poster above said these 15 page laugh fests are getting old. Read the replies great fishermen are getting tired of this stuff. No matter who is in power you will pay taxes..."

PLEASE help me understand this (and I'm not joking) if this is true, how can they get away with this and not be charged with corruption?  Yes, this is true.  While it is officially to cover the cost of negotiations.  I believe the teachers' union did donate to the Liberal party so the optics are not good on this.   Am I correct in understanding that now that the Liberals are in power they are changing the way we vote so that it will make it more difficult for any other party to get into power?  That may be true.  The federal Liberals promised to eliminate the 'most votes wins' system that we have used since Confederation.  The details of the new system have not been announced.  It is likely that we will end up with ranked ballots, which would favour the Liberals.   Is it true that they are now changing the way political donations are made so as to limit anyone elses having the resorces to challange them?  I am not sure about that one.  The current federal system is pretty good.  No corporate or union donations can be made to federal parties or candidates.  There are limits on individual donations so it is difficult for rich individuals to buy candidates.  Unfortunately, corporations and unions can still donate to provincial parties and candidates.  If they make any changes, I hope they have the provinces adopt the current federal rules.  Currently the Liberals have a big advantage at the provincial level.
