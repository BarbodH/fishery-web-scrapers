Fishing was nothing like last saturday. Probly due to the 100 boats out there. We stayed our course and finally hooked up.    This one went home, as it took the hook into the gills and got ripped out. Part of the game . Some get released, some come home. Hey look, Im smiling.LOL    Out on the toon in the morning at first light for whities."
