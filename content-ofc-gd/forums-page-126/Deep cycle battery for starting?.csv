One paragraph mentioned that with the all the electronics on board many boat owners were switching to a deep cycle battery for the starter battery. They did mention that you should be careful with the ""largest motors"" and that you should consult your owners manual.  I've always used a starter battery and not had an issue but I only have one sonar unit, one livewell and a bilge running on the starter battery. I was wondering what others thought about this?"

I've always used a starter battery and not had an issue but I only have one sonar unit, one livewell and a bilge running on the starter battery. I was wondering what others thought about this? I have the same setup, a 7"" sonar/GPS combo and some lights if I am fishing when its dark, I never use the livewell and the bilge pump never comes on, my kicker motor keeps the starting battery topped up when I am trolling, I use a 1000 CCA marine starting battery. If I had too many gadgets, I would consider running 2 batteries in parallel. I do have a group 31 deepcycle battery for my elect trolling motor and always carry jumper cables just in case."

If you're cranking over a 50hp outboard, run one graph, and use your livewells periodically, you can probably get away with either. If you have a 200hp+, multiple graphs and run aerators all day, you may want a more specialized hybrid battery or a high quality cranking battery; one that can take the constant drain and still crank a V6. I personally don't see the need to run 2 batteries in parallel. The technology in today's cranking batteries allow a tournament boat to run 2-3 12 inch screens, structure scan, and livewells all day and then crank a 250hp over to get back; in all temperatures."
970733,Mister G,2016-05-23 12:58:00,1429,My new boat with a E-TEC 90 HO came with a Deep Cycle battery that I thought was strange........it has 625 CCA and 120 minute reserve........works great so for but it's only one year old right now. Time will tell.  BTW the 3 bank on-board battery charger is always plugged in when not fishing with the boat.
970734,Tybo,2016-05-23 13:14:00,1373,Likely talking about agm deep cycle. Which can be used either way.
970794,ecmilley,2016-05-24 01:28:00,2163,True DC battery's usually have a lower CCA. I use a dp27 to crank over my v6. Runs 2 graphs 3 pumps and a talon all day Believe my rating is 220cca and 200 min reserve
