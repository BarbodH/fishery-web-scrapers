Do I need  two battery setup to run all of this stuff?  A starting and a deep cycle or can I run it all off of one battery?  Also - where is the best place to buy?  Of course I'm looking to save money but if warranty outweighs savings, then I'm open to that.  Thanks in advance - I've only really ever owned a small boat that didn't really need a battery.  "
970635,John Bacon,2016-05-22 12:29:00,3277,You definitely need a battery.  A single marine starting battery should be able to handle it.  Walmart and Costco have good value for your money.

Stupid question -  As the motor runs does it charge the starting battery?  I assume the answer is yes - but like I said, I'm a real noob at this.  Thanks"
970647,John Bacon,2016-05-22 15:07:00,3277,"A 125hp will.  Some of the smaller motors do not have alternators to charge a battery.  But larger motors will come with an alternator to charge the battery.  As long a you are not running an electric trolling motor, the main motor should keep your battery charged."

970732,grimsbylander,2016-05-23 12:55:00,3016,"^^^ What Mister said. People think because the outboard can deliver charge to a battery it will keep a battery fully charged. Then they run 10 mins down the lake at half throttle and fish for 2 hours while listening to the radio, running graphs and using livewells. For what you're doing, get one decent battery and put it on a charger after every use."
