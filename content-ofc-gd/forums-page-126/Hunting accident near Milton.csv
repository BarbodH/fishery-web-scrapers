970364,Terry,2016-05-19 21:19:00,14456,"A 68-year-old man is in stable condition in hospital after being shot while hunting in Milton. The shooting happened at 15 Side Road and Sixth Nassagaweya Line just before 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. The man had been shot in the chest, Halton regional police said, but it’s not yet clear how or who shot him. He was airlifted to a Hamilton hospital."

970407,Big Cliff,2016-05-20 07:27:00,6899,"I don't think it's funny at all, I have a lot of friends in the Milton area about that age and I'm worried that it might be one of them. I still can't find out who it is that was shot though."
970408,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-20 07:47:00,8243,"I didn't mean you Cliff. It is scary when you hear about an accident around here, and there are accidents on Hwy. 6 steady and they are usually very bad and you know almost everyone you know uses it, including my wife. I hope the guy is OK."
970414,misfish,2016-05-20 11:12:00,29133,My comment was serious. You know how many idiots hunt? How many shoot at movement?
970415,Fisherman,2016-05-20 11:19:00,7201,"Or simply shoot into the woods because there was a ""noise"" that looked like a turkey or deer."
