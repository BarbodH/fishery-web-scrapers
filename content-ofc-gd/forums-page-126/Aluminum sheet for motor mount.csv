970335,super dave,2016-05-19 17:58:00,323,"So I need to get around to finishing putting my motor on my kayak.  I made a mount out of oak but I saw some pics of aluminum.  Any ideas where I can get a 1/8 thick piece about 14"" x 6""?  I tried the big box stores, no luck"
970337,leaf4,2016-05-19 18:24:00,2466,"Location? Try a sheet metal fabrication shop wherever you're located they might have some, if not try metal supermarkets"
970340,Dara,2016-05-19 18:48:00,3052,"where are you  I have lots of it  heck, canadian tire or home depot should have it too...just they are kinda proud of it"
970354,DanD,2016-05-19 20:48:00,2223,"Do a Canada 411 search for ""metal"" in your your area; I just tried it here for London and got a number of hits. Tell them what size you want and most shops will cut it for you and brake it, at whatever angle bend you might need.  Dan."
970360,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-19 21:10:00,10439,Too bad you aren't near me. I have tons in my shed.
970361,wkrp,2016-05-19 21:13:00,656,Try metal supermarket.
970362,DanD,2016-05-19 21:14:00,2223,"Just had a look in the shop here and I have a piece of 1/8"" aluminum checker plate 5 1/2"" wide and about 4' long. You're welcome to it; if you can/want to come too London?  Dan."
970375,NANUK,2016-05-19 22:15:00,797,Try metal supermarket. X2
970376,kenzy31,2016-05-19 22:17:00,261,Yup this place ^^^ The one here in Barrie is great!
970377,misfish,2016-05-19 22:22:00,29133,"Yup this place ^^^ The one here in Barrie is great!  Ya, but crazy over priced IMO.  Try Pratts Kenzy"
970404,sauce,2016-05-20 03:13:00,219,If you can find a place nearby that makes metal signs for businesses you could probably convince someone to cut a nice piece for you from the scrap bin. Likely made out of the same kind of steel they use for street signs.
970409,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-20 08:12:00,8243,Where are you? It's a small world. We have some nice Aluminum checker plate leftover from a job. The brake is kaput though you would need to get it bent. Any metal fab shop will have it and brake it for you. I won't be back online until Tuesday though.
970420,Dara,2016-05-20 13:12:00,3052,"I work at a fab shop and our break works just fine, so does the shear"
970799,super dave,2016-05-24 01:45:00,323,"Hi guys.  Thanks for everyone that replied.   I'm in Scarborough/Pickering.   If anyone close is willing to donate or sell I'd be very appreciative.   Otherwise I will try the stores mentioned above Thanks dave, Iron, Dan and dara for the offers but a bit too far for me.  Thanks again! Dave"
