I'm looking for a little inside knowledge on this lake as I've never fished it before.  Any help on spots, lures or patterns would be greatly appreciated.  We'll be staying at the Big Moose Camp for the weekend.  Thanks in advance. Tim"
971136,Joeytier,2016-05-25 22:39:00,3990,Its a really busy lake with end-to-end development and lots of fishing pressure.  small average size but still produces a surprising number of hogs.  My guess is one walleye will be caught that blows away all the others while most people struggle with small fish.  Good luck!

971153,Woodsman,2016-05-26 00:29:00,1286,Here's a rough map of the lake.    Big Moose is just above the *  D = Drop off. Vertically jig this area.  N = Narrows. Troll this area with rapala's or chartreuse worm harnasses.  A = Shallow weed flat. Troll here with shallow diving body baits. Blue & silver seems to work good.
