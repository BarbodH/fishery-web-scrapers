970670,pics,2016-05-22 19:06:00,1268,I worked with a guy who was famous for canceling at the last minute.. I would make plans a week or so in advance and he would let me down.. I have a family and he was single so it was tough for me to find time to go fishing.... I vowed the last time it happened that I would never fall for it again so I won't ever fish with him again..
970674,manitoubass2,2016-05-22 19:19:00,11391,"How about the guy that texts ya at 1230, got the day off, be over in 20 mins lol (wormdunker)  Then shows up late?????  Must of got lost in the big city of emo?"
