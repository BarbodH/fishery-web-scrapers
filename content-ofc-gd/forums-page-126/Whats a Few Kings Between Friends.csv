970801,Freshtrax,2016-05-24 02:07:00,2215,"Wow ,  best  48 hours of fishing in my life.  Yesterdays lakerfest was fun and all but i don't fish Lake O for lakers.     I've been itchin for some kings for 6 months.   I've scratched the itch with browns, carp, and lakers but i needed to feel an angry spring king on the end of the line.  problem was i diddnt have anyone to fish with...every one I called was busy on the Monday.   Then I come across Donnely in my phone   ive known him for years but we dont  hang out as much as we should ...He is the  kind of pal you don't talk to for months but is DFW......phone call made ... perfect he is is in.... we both want to loose a few braincells on Sunday evening so a 7 am start is settled.   I was torn, to continue on with our sure thing  laker beat down from the evening before  of search for kings.  A big moon and a high sun with flat water made the decision difficult.   but we rolled the dice.    set up  shallow and trolled into the horizon avoiding the lemmings ( pack of 30 boats )  till we found some cooperative fish.  we lost the first  2 fish halfway to the boat ..we sharpend some hooks and our luck changed      landed these two pigs then the cookie cutters took over         what a weekend  and great start to the season      "

970805,leaf4,2016-05-24 02:17:00,2466,"Sweet day! Hopefully that means this season won't be as slow as last year, I know a couple people who have got on fish already and that's a big difference from the previous two years"
