Flat calm and sunny at 6am, a bit of mist hanging over the water. Not a sound but the buzz of the baitcaster and the splash of the lure. A few really small pike early but the best fish were caught around noon once the wind had put up a very small chop. My brother caught half a hammer handle on a zara spook and the rest were caught on some form of suspending husky jerks. Nice feed of fresh fish tonight for dinner. My 4 year old daughter might be the first person to get some food from my brother's plate... ever. She cried a little but she got the piece of fish that she wanted.      The two biggest fish of the day went back in the drink.   "
