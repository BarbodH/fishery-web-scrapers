970896,Tom McCutcheon,2016-05-24 17:51:00,627,Gone from noisy boats to cleaning up Smokey's Toilet Tissues......LOL
970914,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 19:18:00,8243,"My brother-in-law that has a fairly large landscape company in Halifax came out for a visit one Fall. Never having been to Ontario he asked what those people were doing cleaning up the leaves? He said the best thing for your lawn in the winter and spring is leave the leaves on the grass. Think about it, if you rake up fallen leaves in the spring there is always fresh chutes of healthy grass under those pesky leafs. I have not raked leaves for 16 years and now my neighbours are following suit.  I got him good that trip. We went to Turkey Point for lunch after golf one afternoon then. 75F during an Indian Summer. There is a guy that has a place there and he brings up a few tall mature Palm Tree from Florida every year. Dave went back to Nova Scotia and told everyone that in southern Ontario they have Palm Trees. That isn't a lie really, we do."
970939,jimmer,2016-05-24 20:23:00,2730,Have  you  ever notice the new people moving in never have a super hot wife that likes to sun bath topless......damn new neighbors.........LOL Now that you mention it. :-(  People are way too anal about their lawns. Maybe the same ones with the loud boats!

970954,dave524,2016-05-24 21:05:00,4508,"Where do you blow them? In the neighbors yard? Or into the bush where the wind picks up and blows them right back?  Now if it had a bag attaent and sucked leaves up I could see some use at least(for disabled folk etc)  Come on man'  Grab a freakin rake. Or just mow over it lol  As a kid we just raked them all to the center of the gravel drive, where the weeds grow between the tire ruts, lit them and out came the weenies, foil wrapped potatoes and marshmallows."
970955,manitoubass2,2016-05-24 21:09:00,11391," Guy down the street is weird. Mowes his lawn 3-4 times a week and complains about it being brown.  Id like to tell him why but its funner to watch him repeat this over and over.  Let your gross grow dude! It choke out most weeds, and let it get to 5 or 6"" before cutting it. And its not a golf green, dont cut it so darn low???"

971047,Dara,2016-05-25 15:38:00,3052,"When I first saw the thread title I thought it was going to be about those old fibreglass tri hull boats. The waves slapping under the hull while fishing was sooo annoying.  On another note, we are having a poker run here this summer that those big a$$ boats will be here for. Everybody is quite excited about it as we never see them. I'm wondering how many will hit the rock piles"
971049,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-25 16:12:00,8243,And they say Global Warming is a Myth!

970752,glen,2016-05-23 17:04:00,2641,Some of them boats are way too loud.  Is it the Hey look at me I got a boat. I guess they would lose a few HP to make it quite.  Can you get some kind of big dish that will put the noise right back in their boat.  Darn boat people.
970753,misfish,2016-05-23 17:25:00,29133,"No diffrent then hearing that boom box car/truck, coming up the street a mile away.  Who cares. They go by and gone.  Nieghbour is smoking a joint. Cant stand the smell (unless it,s the good stuff) After about 5 minutes, the smell is gone.  I dont get your point Rob. No disrespect."
970757,manitoubass2,2016-05-23 17:46:00,11391,Bong on!  And living waterfront your pretty much asking for it. Unless of course you bought the house in 1939 or something(draft dodgers lol)  I live next to a railway and I chose to live here so no point in complaining about the noise.
970765,aplumma,2016-05-23 20:05:00,6896,Nothing like firing up my twin 318's on a 28ft Marrinette with a water bath exhaust. The noise and the smell are the greatest sound in the world. If you can't afford to run the big boys at 1 gallon per 1.5 miles then stay with your little boats and enjoy the sound of my pleasure. lol My Ranger with a GTX 150 racing motor burns 9/10 gallon per minute at 60 mph. Don't let them dinosaurs die for no reason. (tongue in cheek). It is all in the way we have fun some love a kayak some want the big motors. The size of a motor has nothing to do with your junk it is the size of your wallet that does.   Art
970781,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 00:10:00,8243,That's the sound of money you hear. The best sound there is would be the sound of a Fighter Jet screaming by when they use the lakeshore here as a road map. It doesn't bother me at all hearing all the boys with their toys. It is much quitter in the past 15 years though as gas prices rose to the point no one is skiing or tubing around here anymore. I miss hearing people enjoying life. Even the sound of hundreds of bikes go by on the way to Port Dover on Friday the 13th is good in my books. Enjoy life or stay indoors is all I can say.
970837,DanD,2016-05-24 11:56:00,2223,"Bong on!  And living waterfront your pretty much asking for it. Unless of course you bought the house in 1939 or something(draft dodgers lol)  I live next to a railway and I chose to live here so no point in complaining about the noise.  X2  The dragstrip in Sparta or now known as the St. Thomas Raceway opened in 1962. Sparta was a very small little village and the dragstrip was more then welcome; due to the money it would bring into the community. Now 50+ years later and after a bunch of non racers have moved into the village; there is a non stop fight with the ""new"" residents trying to have the dragstrip shut down. Come on people, you must have known that a dragstrip means noise; why in the hell did you buy a house there?    Dan."
970855,AKRISONER,2016-05-24 14:35:00,5558,"noise doesnt bother me, but when seeing a guy driving a cigarette boat back and forth with a huge rooster tail on Lower buckhorn, i dont get upset, I just laugh at the poor guy's lack of package."
970857,jimmer,2016-05-24 15:37:00,2730,The leaf blower showed up in my lakefront neighbourhood this weekend. New people moved in a week ago and low and behold. I'm more interested to see how my noisy next door neighbours are going to deal with some competition. LOL

970872,Mister G,2016-05-24 16:58:00,1429,"Because it makes noise while the old rake doesn't............you know, MORE POWER.......  BTW it takes me half the time to rake then it would be blow the leaves away.......MORONS ! ! !"

970876,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 17:03:00,8243,"I have a neighbour here on the lake that cuts some of his firewood up with a Skill Saw. I guess it's quitter then a chainsaw. His wife was saying the noise of the Wind Turbines bothered her, I replied "" More than Paul's Skill Saw singing all day long?"".  Rick, a gas powered leaf blower is just an extension of ones appendage."
970877,manitoubass2,2016-05-24 17:08:00,11391,Where do you blow them? In the neighbors yard? Or into the bush where the wind picks up and blows them right back?

You ever try to rake up 1 billion of these things? (I've got 2 maple trees on my property, lol!).   The vac sucks them up and mulches them, basically turns them into dust.   One of my fav yard tools for sure.  "
970895,manitoubass2,2016-05-24 17:46:00,11391,"No ive never tried to rake them up bill. My lawn get cut thats it.  The only thing I rake is pine needles for fires. The rest doesnt bother me one bit, its a fricken lawn. It doesnt need one hair cut and about 33 shape ups lol"
970508,captpierre,2016-05-21 01:48:00,2521,Does anybody know if there are laws regarding noisy boats? Saw a large speedboat at the Fenlon locks today. Rediclously loud exhaust. Tonight fishing a smaller speedboat flies by. The car engine behind the driver was taller than he was sitting. Crazy loud. I had just been stopped by OPP at 7 pm. Next to Boyd Island. All good. No issues. Should have asked them.
970511,irishfield,2016-05-21 02:00:00,26272,"Age is creeping up with you...  That said, it is supposed to be illegal to run open transom exhaust within 5 miles of shore. Tell that to any one of the 100+ scarabs running around the Sound on Gbay... yet they complain about my airplane taking off. Even had one of them show up in my yard, but he won't ever be back after I told him exactly where he lived and how short a swim it was from my f-in-laws dock to sink his boat."

I must admit that I do love the sound of radial plane engines too.  And the sound of a full after burner CF-18 on takeoff.

970646,kickingfrog,2016-05-22 15:02:00,8333,CTV News Barrie did a piece on Saturday about noisy boats and mention the law that Irish referred to.  Here's the 2 minute clip:  http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=875507
970648,Terry,2016-05-22 15:14:00,14456,"yup sometimes you hear them coming for 20 minutes before you can see them , might be a touch loud for those sleeping waterfront home owners...lol"
970650,dave524,2016-05-22 15:52:00,4508,"I get them here as well, them and being next to the lake there is frequent helicopters overhead, something to do with them not allowed over open water so they skirt the lakeshore."
970664,aplumma,2016-05-22 18:41:00,6896,I will tell what is loud an airboat on the river. I have no issues with noise it is part of the freedom and enjoyment we have on the water.  Art
970667,misfish,2016-05-22 18:56:00,29133,"yup sometimes you hear them coming for 20 minutes before you can see them , might be a touch loud for those sleeping waterfront home owners...lol   I love watching that guy zip up the bay, when were out on the toon.  I count 1 gallon a minute.LOL Sweet music."
970668,kickingfrog,2016-05-22 19:02:00,8333,"Sounds great, but when someone's freedom encroaches on another's? Where does my freedom start, and their's ends? Where is the ""line"" drawn? There is a law in place. What if someone felt that their freedom was to dump their garbage on my lawn? This isn't going to be solved here but these are some of the questions that come up and it can't just be shrugged off by a slogan."
970669,Tybo,2016-05-22 19:02:00,1373,Any engine that uses 40+ gallons an hour on the water is good by me. An I want two of them.

This isn't going to be solved here but these are some of the questions that come up and it can't just be shrugged off by a slogan. I have found once we start limiting anyone's rights it usually gets broader and broader until it consumes more than it was intended. If a little noise is made on a body of water sometimes it turns into an all electric lake when it does not warrent that.  Just thoughs.  Art"
970673,manitoubass2,2016-05-22 19:18:00,11391,"At least im not alone???  I enjoy the sound. I mean not constantly but you know, every here and there.  But im mental and the train that cruises by our house luls me to sleep ???"
970690,kickingfrog,2016-05-22 22:10:00,8333,"Again where does one person's freedom end, and another's start?  Does my freedom allow me to render someone's boat silent? That would be absurd. There is a line. To suggest there isn't is equally absurd. Where the line is is the difficulty. The notion of freedom relies on an awareness of someone else's equal entitlement to freedom and then respect for it.  And again, there is a law that does govern this particular question here. Maybe the law needs to be reevaluated and/or modified but that's not what is being discussed."
970691,kickingfrog,2016-05-22 22:13:00,8333,"At least im not alone  I enjoy the sound. I mean not constantly but you know, every here and there.  But im mental and the train that cruises by our house luls me to sleep  I love the sound and the feel of them as well, but I don't have to listen to them at 6 in the morning when I'm sleeping either."
