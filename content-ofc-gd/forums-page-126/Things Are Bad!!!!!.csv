After this many will have bid farewell to Fort Mac and go back to where ever they once came from. It must be frustrating being laid off constantly and have the huge cost of living associated with living there full time."

970153,LeafsFan,2016-05-18 12:11:00,19,"There is a lot of misinformation out there right now since many of the news outlets are relying on people's social media accounts.  I saw one posting of a video of people supposedly driving through the fire in Fort Mac that definitely was not from this current fire.  It is bad, I am 150 km away from that mess right now, but when the winds change, the smoke blows in, and the sun or moon turns blood red.  With how dry everything is up here, there is not much they can do except for building a dozer guard (where they use dozers to push and move everything that may catch fire for the most part, taking away fuel).  Many of the major oil companies have massive areas of gravel around their facilities to help with a fire guard to protect their infrastructure, much less around many of the third party camps or smaller operations though."
970184,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-18 15:13:00,10439,I saw on the news last night that even though the fire has moved away from Mac there are still fires and hot spots in town. They said a house blew up yesterday damaging a bunch of other homes and also showed some buildings on fire in town. It's far from over out there.  On a happy note we got a decent amount of rain overnight here in Yellowknife and it's cool and cloudy today.

I heard myself say to my wife today, our tax dollars are being used up there, then I slapped myself and went into a bank and donated. Well wishes and prayers help but money works immediately.   I would suggest to Management Rick that if they have workers exposed to deadly gases and are in a position to egress only by jumping 60 feet to the ground you have a huge problem and a simple solution. It's called a Scott Air Pac. For egress situations they sell 5 minute Scott Air Pacs specifically designed for short term use for immediate egress in a toxic gas environment. They are only the size of a small propane bottle and weigh hardly anything. Hear the alarm, don the SAP and calmly egress the area to safety. I'll split the bonus with you. Where do you work, Iran? They wear sandals while casting molten metal and a wet rag across their faces is a resperator. Not all plants, some. If they need a Health&Safety consultant give them my email address, I ain't cheap though.  edit: I wrote India by mistake, India has impressive plants. That's where Arcilor Mittal originated.

Now send the resources they need, be it money, fire fighters, military, whatever. Just do it. He should have had his ass there yesterday but I'm sure his people told him it's not safe, maybe. Nothing wrong with being south of the city and talking to the exodus of citizens on the highway. Take a lesson from Bush Jr's mistake of being late to New Orleans and see the loss from the ground not in a chopper a mile above.

As well as food, water and shelter. A family pulls up in a car heading south from the city with only the shirts on their backs who do you think they are? The Griswald's going to Vegas?  I don't remember to whom but read before the fire started the Fed's just earmarked 500K to a country for such an important reason I don't remember to whom or why? I hope this thread doesn't go political so I'm thinking about not posting this. It probably will anyway as soon as we know everyone is safe.

Laborer, carpenter, concrete foreman, site superintendent, now crane operator.  I'm having a hard time to understand how they will ever rebuild the city.  The oil companies have their work camps north of the city for their workers but with the loss of many homes where will the people live who are going to perform work needed to construct the new homes/buildings?   It's mindboggling!!  Fort Mac is a very remote city.  Unlike southern Ontario,- for example if you lived in Kitchener & a major work project was required in Mississauga or Vaughan or even Whitby it's a short commute.  Once you leave Fort Mac (heading north or south) there is nothing but bush for many, many miles."

What if all the resources had to be focused on a plant ablaze rather than the community? They are stretched to the max now. We had an inhouse Fire Dept. that would be the envy of many towns in Canada. Some of the gases produced at the Coke Ovens were used during WW1, Mustard gas being one of them.

When I was watching CBC weather I thought they made a mistake and had the temps in Fahrenheit. From 25 to 31C across the province. That is just strange. Al Gore may be onto something.  Prayers to all those folks up there. Wild fires are a fact of life up your way for years Blizz. I watched one those Yukon shows and Tanana was nearly burnt to the ground last year. Now there are people where there weren't any before in harms way.
968487,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-04 03:57:00,10439,This reminds me of the 1979 CN train derailment in Mississauga. Tens of thousands were evacuated then. We were just West of the dividing line living in Erin Mills @ the time. I was working in the shop in the basement and felt the two largest explosions which happened at Mavis Rd.  Still have a chunk of the train I got from my buddies back yard after the clean up.

968490,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 04:34:00,8243,"Unfathomable. The Fire Dept may catch fire. When all the public are evacuating the brave firefighters are going towards the devastation. The air can't be breathed. If anyone has had to wear a Scott Air Pac you would know how heavy and cumbersome a 30 minute pac is. Now think about wearing it and all your protective equipment in 50C plus heat. Much hotter the closer you get to the blaze. And it's only the first of May, what is going to happen north this summer. Bad just bad.  I have to confess my personal southern Ontario ignorance for the North West. I know many guys that went to the oil and gas projects. I pictured Fort MacMurray as a rural work site town, trailers, shanty's and company stores the way it was when I was there a long long time ago. You couldn't tell from that video if it was Oakville or Orangeville, St Catherines or Sarnia. That ""city"" has come a long way. Now having said that it might not be a good thing. I kind of like it the way it was.  Blizz have you been there lately? Is part of the ""old"" Ft. Mac still standing? We downed a few frosties at a place called the Northern Nugget or something like that. That draught beer was double what it was in Hamilton then, maybe more.  Prayers to all, but some special psalms to the Emergency workers please."
968499,wormdunker,2016-05-04 11:51:00,1711,"It's a terrible situation!  I did work out there for 3 years.  A few of the problems the residents are facing is highway 63 is the only route in or out of the city.  North of the city there is absolute desolation with the exception of the oil plants & the camps that house the workers.  Going south out of Fort McMurray it's a 5 hour drive to Edmonton!  If the local gas stations run out of gas how are the residents going to evacuate?  Evacuees are running out of gas as they attempt to drive south to Edmonton.  Those residents that choose to head north to the work camps may find them filled to capacity, possibly running out of food & water.  How will these camps get much needed supplies in?  I just saw on the news that Beacon Hill (a subdivision of Ft. Mac) has lost 80% of their homes!  Very sad.  Workers are attempting to get to the airport at the south end of the city, but, being turned back due to the fires.  The fire chief of the city stated there are 80 firefighters attempting to bring the wild fires under control.  That sounds like a rather low number to me.  I don't understand why other firefighters & equipment are not deployed to the area considering the size of these fires & the devastation they could cause.  My former supervisor was able to fly home yesterday morning.  Another co worker evacuated to a company shop north of the city.  Unfortunately there are no stores in that area to get supplies.  My thoughts & prayers to the residents/workers of Fort McMUrray."
968501,Blue Lk,2016-05-04 12:24:00,337,"I was able to talk to my son last night,he's a manager at Suncor,stuck on site because of the gridlock on the hwy caused be the evacuation.I just found out my daughter in law & my grandkids were able to ""get out of dodge""last night & are settled in one of the camps . Very scary situation for sure."

The camps are full, Lac La Biche has plenty of space. Whitecourt and other towns have offered up free hotel rooms to all the refugees. I don't know if our water bombers have been dispatched to fight the fires or not."

968548,Steve,2016-05-04 21:58:00,2075,"you know what is really sad, we Insure a number of oil and gas companies.....  they, so far, aren't seeing any loss to assets (outside of worker camps) because they have the $$$$$ to fund private fire brigades to protect their assets.  so while the homes are burning, and the government can't employ enough fire fighters to keep the fire under control, the oil and gas companies aren't having any issues (so far) keeping their billion dollar assets safe.  money certainly talks."
