Saturday was slow, a dozen or so 24"" pike released and 2 20"" eyes.  It was cold most of the day too.    Monday was a bit better, starting off slow and progressing into double headers.  5 eyes 20 to 25"" a bunch of small pike and a couple of smallmouth that went back I saved one pike because a friend asked me to bring him one.
