I was once driving a buddy's truck and boat back home ( he had a headache ) imagine that, lol. I felt a bounce and looked back into the side view mirror,  NO TIRE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF TRAILER. Hit something on the road and the tire was toast. Another incident was me, I was standing on the very wet dock, algae included, a wave came in and poof, I was in the water, ha ha . I did spill my beer. Shore lunch story was great,  chased out of our spot by a bear on  Lake Biscotasing, he won , we scrammed out real fast. Post what you recall on some of your trips, We all need a good chuckle from time to time. Rick."

Pulled over and put the trailer back on the ball where it belonged and went fishing.
