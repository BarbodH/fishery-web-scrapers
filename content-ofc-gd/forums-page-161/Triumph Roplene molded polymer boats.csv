929876,mike rousseau,2015-08-17 15:23:00,4661,Hey everyone...  Do any if you own one of these boats or know anyone that's has owned one?  Dropped my boat and motor off at in Clayton NY for repairs and these boats caught my eye... When I got closer I realized they weren't glass boats but what I thought was plastic  The material is called Roplene molded polymer... From what I've read the material I rediculous tough and there are a bunch of torture test videos online as well...  I hope to test drive the 17' tiller they had in the water when I pick up my boat... See how it rides..  I'm thinking it'll be smooth like glass but light weight like aluminium...
929886,OhioFisherman,2015-08-17 15:45:00,6623,"http://www.triumphboats.com/boats/170-dc/details.php  First I have heard of them, their selection does look limited?"
929893,mike rousseau,2015-08-17 16:51:00,4661,Yup but they have a 17' tiller wich is the perfect size for me  : )
929895,manitoubass2,2015-08-17 16:59:00,11391,They look like awesome boats too me!  The wear test video of dropping one outta the sky was kinda lame though?
929898,OhioFisherman,2015-08-17 17:05:00,6623,"They aren't a bad looking boat, and look like they would be easy to clean up without carpeting. I looked at the 17 dual console and 19 on the site, neither seemed to be running the maximum recommended motor?  A cracked hull or transom on those might be a hard fix?"

929901,manitoubass2,2015-08-17 17:32:00,11391,Does it say the weights of the boats anywhere on the site?  Id imagine these to be awful light but what do i know?
929906,FloatnFly,2015-08-17 17:58:00,1640,"Just watched this video on facebook, pretty cool  "
929908,dave524,2015-08-17 18:13:00,4508,Almost sounds like that Ram-X stuff that Coleman made the scanoes out of. Didn't they have some kind of torture test commercial too?
929924,John Bacon,2015-08-17 20:05:00,3277,Plastic canoes are not particularly light.  I wouldn't expect these to be significantly lighter than aluminum.  They may even be heavier than aluminum.  They can probably handle rock better than other boats.  You will still have to worry about your prop though.
929934,grimsbylander,2015-08-17 20:33:00,3016,Being a bit heavier may help with a smoother ride.
929998,2 tone z71,2015-08-18 00:25:00,1311,If it's anything like the plastic they used on them floating dock tubes..it's a pretty easy repair to a torn hull ..not for me but cool technology
930004,Steve,2015-08-18 00:44:00,2075,"no, no, much stronger than the floating dock tubes...  I'm sure a more modern version of the material the Coleman Scanoe is made out of (as mentioned above).  you can't break that stuff...but like also already mentioned, it's generally heavier than aluminum as well."
930007,woodenboater,2015-08-18 01:03:00,2277,"1287 lbs for the dual console 17 with a 70 horse Yamaha on the back. Weight looks comparable to a Legend 16 foot full windshield. Wonder if the build is similar to Whaler or the old KMV boats. Let us know what you think, another option is always good to have"
930065,Fisherpete,2015-08-18 09:31:00,1814,"Mike one of the five star lodges up at LOTW (Wiley Point) runs an entire fleet of these - they have smaller ones with 50hp tillers and bigger ones with 115's if I remember right. They were sick and tired of aluminum boats getting trashed on the rocks up there. None of the boats had trolling motors on them - not sure if this is because of hull design or just another lodge decision. Andrew and I were baffled as to how you can effectively fish LOTW without a trolling motor - but then this is a 5 star lodge and almost every guest was going out with a guide on the tiller. They looked like they rode nice, and cut thru the waves better than an aluminum with their weight. Easy to clean also."
930122,chrismarkz,2015-08-18 15:19:00,20,"I currently own the Triumph Bay 190 with a 115 Yamaha 4 stroke.  Great boat..... never haver to worry about buoys or beaching on a sandy beach.  It never will shine up like a glass boat and it does stain a bit if you don't wash off blood or coloured liquids.  But I haven't had any major issues. I did install the t-top, trolling motor and power pole. With 2 guys it will max out at 35 mph. Before I added all the accessories I was running at 48 mph. With the modified V haul I have a draft of 12"" but I have no problem staying dry in 2 ft waves, I fish Simcoe and Erie regularly so I have been my share of 4-6 footers.  Great boat would recommend it to anyone.   "
930148,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-18 19:25:00,8243,"You have a very nice rig there Chris. Perfect for Erie as it looks easily trailer able and stable enough for the strong SW winds.  That video of them cutting that SeaHunter in 2 made me weep. The title should be ""Things rich Americans can do""."
