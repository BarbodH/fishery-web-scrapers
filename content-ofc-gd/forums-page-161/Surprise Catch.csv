929982,John Bacon,2015-08-17 23:46:00,3277,Not mine.  I understand that is came off a downrigger 85' down on the U.S. side of Lake Ontario.   http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb404/tennis_pwn/GoldFishDownRigger.jpg    
929990,outllaw,2015-08-18 00:07:00,1232,wow don't see that everyday
929991,Steve,2015-08-18 00:13:00,2075,    wow. not in a million years.
929992,Steve,2015-08-18 00:13:00,2075,"btw, great setup on lake ontario!!"
930008,spincast,2015-08-18 01:04:00,3279,caught some of my biggest kings on orange spoons............
930027,John Bacon,2015-08-18 02:19:00,3277,"btw, great setup on lake ontario!!  Do you prefer that over a Spin Doctor and Fly?"
930028,Freshtrax,2015-08-18 02:24:00,2215,Longer leader than I run.....that's why i don't catch goldfish
930069,Steve,2015-08-18 10:47:00,2075," Do you prefer that over a Spin Doctor and Fly?  not usually, but that that combo has still caught lots of fish..."
930073,ckewley,2015-08-18 11:22:00,699,"Saw a big one cruising Jordon Harbour  a few weeks back, thought it was a beer can in the weeds at first."
930079,OhioFisherman,2015-08-18 12:17:00,6623,"It wasn't unusual to see those that size and a bit larger along the shallower areas of the lakefront in Cleveland when I was a kid, I had no idea they would go that deep.  We never saw small ones, I am just guessing it would be pretty hard for them to hide from predators."
930095,Mike Pike,2015-08-18 13:39:00,1332,Wow!  I know wild goldfish can live quite comfortably in ponds and lakes but I would never have thought at 80 foot depths.  And chasing down a bait trolled at speed?  I dunno.. it sounds like a stretch.
930246,adolson,2015-08-19 08:25:00,783, I dunno.. it sounds like a stretch.  I think it's fairly common to catch a fish in 80 feet of water and then leave it on the hook until you get back to shore so you can snap a pic on the docks. Isn't it?
930255,Steve,2015-08-19 11:14:00,2075,"Well, i agree there...  that photo has obviously been Shirley'd"

930279,porkpie,2015-08-19 13:32:00,2521,Oh no
930296,farsider,2015-08-19 14:45:00,456,"Becoming more common but......80'?  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/06/25/giant-goldfish-swarm-in-toronto-waters.html  http://file:///C:/Users/mtmca_000/Downloads/Goldfish_fact_sheet_web.pdf   I always thought that they would be an amazing Pike bait but I wouldn't risk using live ones.  Now salted ones....  Cheers, Mark"
930334,cram,2015-08-19 18:59:00,1733,"That's like ""Finding Nemo"" level of bizarre.  Holy cow."
930347,landry,2015-08-19 20:26:00,1005,I caught a 10 lb catfish on a burned double ten Muskie bucktail yesterday on St Clair. Not quite as weird as this but rather odd still.
930366,Dutch01,2015-08-19 22:09:00,1431,"The Star link has a chart showing goldfish caught while surveying. If I'm reading it right, they caught one in Pickering that was 3.5 pounds! That's a mighty big Goldfish!"
930401,OhioFisherman,2015-08-20 01:13:00,6623,"The Star link has a chart showing goldfish caught while surveying. If I'm reading it right, they caught one in Pickering that was 3.5 pounds! That's a mighty big Goldfish! Some of the ones we saw in Lake Erie had to be 3-4 pounds, i don't think Lake Erie on this side has anything big enough to swallow one of those fatties!"
930585,Steve,2015-08-20 23:55:00,2075,"confirmed.  this was just a fish story.  goldfish was netted in the harbour, and posed for the photo......"

930684,Mike Pike,2015-08-21 16:52:00,1332,Ah Ha!  See!  You have to get up pretty early in the morning to put one over on the OFC'rs
