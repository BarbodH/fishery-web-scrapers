929923,misfish,2015-08-17 20:03:00,29133,"Ok, so there's a guy fishing your FAVOURITE spot. Do you go somewhere else?  I""ve been in both situations. If somebody is where I want to be, and there is enough room, I'll get to talking distance, be a nice guy, and shoot the bull. If I don't get the right vibe, I leave.  I hate when your on an spot, and guys get close too. I'm sure we all do, but none of us own the lakes.  Can't really win, eh?  S.   If somebody is where I want to be, I'll get to talking distance,  See, I wont even do that, I just say crap and keep moving. I hate it so why make someone  upset.  but none of us own the lakes  Yup, I dont own the lake or the spot, but do show respect.  BIG DIFFERENCE."
929958,netminder,2015-08-17 21:14:00,514,"I will admit, sometimes it's tough to understand the etiquette and keep everyone happy. I'll try and stay far enough away that I'm twice as far as either of us could cast, although that doesn't seem like enough for a lot of people. Sometimes my boat drifts (and quite easily I might add especially if I'm in the inflatable), and I don't want to put the anchor down. Sometimes there just isn't a whole hell of a lot of space on the small lakes I fish on. What is the rule of thumb for everyone in terms of buffers around them?  And yes, I am fairly new to fishing in areas where other people are also fishing."
929968,Acountdeleted,2015-08-17 22:06:00,2562,When you're a good fisherman you just go to one of your other favourite spots.
929976,irishfield,2015-08-17 22:55:00,26272,"Maybe it's just some magnet in Terry's . 3500 miles of shoreline and this guy sets up right beside him, not a word or a hello !    "
929983,Acountdeleted,2015-08-17 23:51:00,2562,"Actually I have a really good question for the community.  You're fishing (dock, boat, whatever) and you hook into something good. As you do, someone cruises by in a boat, pretty obvious they are scoping out the area to fish, but they can't see that you are reeling a fish in. Do you play it a little longer until they pass by?"
929985,IndySKS,2015-08-17 23:55:00,134,Its bad enough when the guy does it once but following you around from spot to spot gets beyond what is bare-able. I hate people near me. Most times i just pick up and move on. A couple years ago i had a guy do just that and after following to the third place i had enough and picked up my markers and lead him into an area that is circled by rocks with only one way in. Of course i made ot look like i was catching fish one after another and it wasnt long till company was coming... I can still see the look of the guy on the bow yell...ROCKS!  Just as a lot of crunching and clunkng started. Problem solved.
929989,Mister G,2015-08-18 00:03:00,1429,"YES, I have mastered this while crappie fishing but when perch fishing deep water on Erie I will wave other anglers over to share the bite. Shallow water fish spook very easily, especially when clowns throw their anchors."
929995,Steve,2015-08-18 00:17:00,2075,"try hiding a big king on your line in 20' of water, 5am in the morning, just out from a pier head....all the while the days fleet of boats are cruising out and you don't want to show the fleet that the fish are in shallow...  my father and I have literally had 20 boats pass us and blast out to 100' of water while fighting a single King....  hide away my friend, hide away  :)"
929999,Gallie,2015-08-18 00:30:00,1215,"I dont like it when people get too close to me so i try stay away from them, even ice fishing cooks bay where people pack together like sardines i will find a spot thats minimum hundreds of feet away to set up my portable."
930006,KLINKER,2015-08-18 00:58:00,256,"I had a guy fish under my boat, is that too close?  We were at Main Duck and the turny guys were all ""don't come near me"". When I lost the only fish anybody had seen all day at the boat a guy comes flying in and tosses a jig, I thought it was pretty funny."
930031,Beans,2015-08-18 02:37:00,3339,"My bro-in-law hollered at a guy that had tossed his lure right next to our boat...  ""would you be as quick to steal my wife as you are to steal my fishing spot ?""  As it turned out it was Gus and Steve Jojos and they were trying to get our attention...our niece's husband had told them to look us up as they were making a show that day...They went thier own way and we had our best two hours of bass fishing ever at the spot we told them we were going to try...LOL"
930077,Acountdeleted,2015-08-18 12:12:00,2562,"I actually love when people pack in tight with ice fishing. It's such a strange beast. I have had times where I have just been cleaning up, and 6 feet away from me, people are getting skunked. All I can do is laugh."
930080,Gallie,2015-08-18 12:18:00,1215,"6 feet? Haha sounds about right. At the beginning of march we moved the permanent hut way in shallow probably 1500-2000 ft. from the next nearest hut, lo and behold 4 guys on one 4 wheeler roll up and start fishing not 30 feet from us... I was speechless lol."
930082,misfish,2015-08-18 12:29:00,29133,Why I love my hub. No fish get thrown outside of it.
930083,BillM,2015-08-18 12:33:00,17367,"One reason why I really took a break from Simcoe this year through the ice..   I don't need people trying to grease me out, I'll leave that to the rubes on the tribs."
930085,AKRISONER,2015-08-18 12:48:00,5558,"thats what 1 ounce spoons and treble hooks are for  I was out 2 weeks ago in the middle of a large bay on a small shoal, sure enough a random boat comes up parks nearby...as we are drifting the shoal, the guy makes a b line right to where we were....I immediately started casting towards his boat to let him know, but what an idiot the guy came within 10 yards of us before he got the message as our lures were flying all around him."
930097,manitoubass2,2015-08-18 13:41:00,11391,"Ive got in a fight over this once with two americans that were illegaly fishing the canadian side and encroaching  Not only did one guy get beat up but they both got arrested too(when they landed on canadian soil to start a fight).  Nowadays im older and wiser, anyone encroatches i just be polite and maybe make a few friends for the day, if not i just move.  Its not worth the hassle nor the stress to let it bother ya"
930098,Gallie,2015-08-18 13:44:00,1215,"Rubes.... Soooo many rubes... Hahaha Brian i rarely keep anything so people arent coming over because they see me catchin, i think they just wonder if im on to something so far away from the crowds, not too many jumbos in 3ft of water if you know what i mean."
929646,misfish,2015-08-15 16:56:00,29133,"Guess I was just too happy to be out fishing again, I didnt feal like yelling or explaining fishing etiquette  to these guys.   BUT  If anyone knows these guys, maybe you can talk to them in thier language and explain fishing etiquette.      "
929652,Rodbender,2015-08-15 17:33:00,1027,Glad you got out bet it felt great
929654,Rizzo,2015-08-15 17:36:00,4754,they are nearly in your back pocket
929655,misfish,2015-08-15 17:42:00,29133,"they are nearly in your back pocket  LOL  They were in Terrys lap before this. Even a jet ski guy made a comment believe it or not. Do you think they are close enough. LMAO  Alls good, just hope maybe they see this or some of thier friends and say thats a NO NO. LOL"
929656,misfish,2015-08-15 17:45:00,29133,Glad you got out bet it felt great  It was AWESOME  Nothing like top water before dawn on glass waters. Sorry ya missed the action bud. Need to be up at 4 am now to get  on the water for the early bite. Darn changing of the sun rise time.LOL
929665,BillM,2015-08-15 19:17:00,17367,"People are idiots, glad you didn't let that ruin your morning."
929666,Terry,2015-08-15 19:49:00,14456,yup they were so close i could not make a cast  ...
929668,Paudash,2015-08-15 21:14:00,273,"That is when I pull out the old Musky bait and say ops sorry I did not realize you came that close to me, I hope it did not scratch your boat"
929670,pics,2015-08-15 21:34:00,1268,I had the same issue when I was crappie fishing in the spring.. I was in a canoe near the shore catching some nice ones right under me and 2 guys on land showed up and put their floats right next to the canoe...
929671,dave524,2015-08-15 21:39:00,4508,"My eyesight must be going or it's the perspective of a wide angle lense, but they look to be at least a long cast away, it's not like you can read the numbers on the boat or even the Manufacturer on the side from the video."
929676,Bill Shearer,2015-08-15 22:08:00,456,"I had the same thoughts, Dave. Perspective is everything, and I'd bet it is the lens. I have to add though that inexperienced anglers seem to be drawn like a magnet to any other boat/s on the lake. The places to fish on most lakes, (including Simcoe)are huge, so the newbies naturally want to assume everybody else out there knows ""the spots"" Now, if you want to compare to what those of us go through on the rivers for Steelhead? People moving in so close that you can touch them with your rod! (In fact I've been tempted to do it!) So, Loogans are everywhere, and dealing with them is a PITA. For every one we enlighten to the etiquette, there will be three that need it. IMO"
929679,Terry,2015-08-15 22:51:00,14456,they were within 25 ft of me
929681,Bill Shearer,2015-08-15 23:05:00,456,The cameras perspective is nowhere near what it actually was. In that case I would have been casting at their heads!
929690,mr blizzard,2015-08-16 01:08:00,1589,"Glad I left there, got tired of what u went thru , in the winter some thing put his line in my sons hole I had just drilled just off snake is.  He was driving a tin box car, opened his door and thru his line down the hole before my son finished rigging up, I wont say any more except I jigged his spoon up from the bottom 1 hr later, needless to say I offered to give it back to him,,,,but I could not find him"
929694,Handlebarz,2015-08-16 02:18:00,3790,When this happens to me I just keep casting towards them or use big rubber it makes a huge splash at their boat side. It drives me nuts on a huge lake no one around but now you want me to shorten my cast not going to happen
929697,Moosebunk,2015-08-16 05:39:00,3970,"It's even more annoying when you're in a tube, like you are.  Has happened a couple times to me as well Brian, except that one time it pushed me to leave an area, kick twenty minutes to cross a lake to a spot that usually sucks, only to find that spot loaded with largies willing to hit a buzzbait.  Karma will get you and them back. lol."
929701,dave524,2015-08-16 11:34:00,4508,"they were within 25 ft of me  I need to get my head wrapped around the wide angle views of these new GoPro type devices, I was guessing at least 3 times that with my old 35MM SLR / Kodachrome brain."
929704,Mister G,2015-08-16 11:57:00,1429,"I always ask them ""excuse me, am I in the way, should I move"" ?  Then just as I'm leaving I make the remark ""you don't have to go in the bathroom to see the as holes""."
929705,outllaw,2015-08-16 12:08:00,1232,some folks should not have children.
929714,Acountdeleted,2015-08-16 15:11:00,2562,That is one of those things that drive me nuts. I was at my buddies cottage this weekend and we didn't have a boat up there so we are fishing off the dock. The polite fishermen will pull out their lines and go around my buddies dock before continuing to shore fish for bass. The morons will pull to within 10 feet of the dock and pitch less then a few inches away from where we are sitting.  Once Nikki and I were on Restoule using worms and catching small bass and sunfish. A guy in a boat pitches a massive spinner right beside the kayak and says 'I want to see if all those small fish are attracting any Muskie'. I responded 'you try that again and you won't see anything because I'll give you two black eyes'.
929791,Sebabmw,2015-08-16 23:48:00,13,"Man o man ,this just happened to us yesterday on sparrow , nice lake but I couldn't believe my eyes, first I see 2 guys in a white little dingy gun it and park no more than 10 feet from 2 other fellas that were on the spot for a while, as I shook my head in disbelief I thought what would I do if thay happened to me , fast forward 5hrs we are sitting on a point off an island , low and behold I see a black Lund coming at me with his trolling motor down, I figure there is now way this clown is going to come right in front of us , well I was wrong 5 min later and 5 feet from the boat buddy slowly cruises by not a care in the world. I could feel my blood pressure rising as I raised my arms in the air in amazement, luckily my fishing partner just said let it go, which I did but really these lakes are big enough for everyone to enjoy! I don't understand some people , it's just etiquette and respect for people, I just hope I don't ever come across this fella again as next time there may be a cast or two coming his way."
929797,GBW,2015-08-17 00:35:00,8460,I have that happen on the time on the lake my folks live on. Some 'fool' will come up within 10 feet of me all the time. Next time his pic get's posted here. There is a huge area he could travel around me but nope he never does... *edit to add* and yes it's the same 'fool' every time...
929798,irishfield,2015-08-17 00:37:00,26272,You not own a cordless drill and know how to swim underwater Geoff ?
