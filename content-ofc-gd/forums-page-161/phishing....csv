But conditions were just perfect for a little hours long shore fish by myself.  I used pickeral rigs(lol) with minnows, set them up on holders and waited.  About 7 it popped off. Walleye one after another. I was happy cause  still learning this stretch of the river.  Its a really boring method but effective.  Toss out your line, put in a holder and sit and wait.  But the scenery and weather were so awesome i wasnt phased.  In about 2 hours i caught about 12 or 14 walleye, all dinks but good eaters, bout 13"" or so.  As i txted wifey to come pick me up, i hooked a sturgeon! But on a pickeral rig I had no chance. Im guessing the fish was maybe 25 or 30lbs. Got it 30 ft from shore and it spit the hook, bummer.  So, i tied my fish to a log. Next thing I know there is a friggen skunk behind me lol. It darts off but its looking for my fish. First time i ever seen that!  After the skunk it was a gull.  Anyhow it was a beauty evening and a great shorefish!!!!          All in all a great day! The bass and pike went nuts about 7pm. Sturgeon too!  Awesome to see and just a nice relaxing night out!"

930675,manitoubass2,2015-08-21 15:38:00,11391,"Hahaha yeah no doubt. When i first turned around he must not have seen me, he was about 5ft away. Then he ran through abit of bush and went 20ft down the shorline where I had tied my fish off. Luckily he didnt grab them! But i guess even skunks like walleye too???  The walleye on this stretch of the river are weird. I cant figure out any other method other then pickeral rig or a drop shot with minnows.  They just refuse to take anything else??? Maybe itll change with the seasons who knows?  I really wanted to land that sturgeon man. Bummed me right out when it popped off"
930682,leaf4,2015-08-21 16:30:00,2466,"Wow amazing to have that at your back door, I wish! Throw on some 30lb braid in case the sturgeon decides to come back lol I would be having walleye with everything haha"
930683,manitoubass2,2015-08-21 16:44:00,11391,The river is chock full of sturgeon but you cant target them.  If i go back with a jig and a minnow however ill catch em lots  My rod is spooled with 20lb braid but the pickeral rig is only 20lb mono. No chance
930774,Leecher,2015-08-22 18:31:00,7832,Sounds like fun Rick!!!  Shore fishing at it's best right there!!!
