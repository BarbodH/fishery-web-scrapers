929627,Rizzo,2015-08-15 13:09:00,4754,"We are debating buying a cottage on either Head Lake or Rush Lake. I was just wondering if anyone has ever fished Rush Lake before, and if so, how was it. Feel free to pm me. I have fished Head Lake a number of times so know the pros (good numbers of small muskies) and the cons (new lower unit anyone?). I personally have never caught a musky bigger than 42 inches and scrawny like a hockey stick in Head Lake, but feel its a good lake for the family. If anyone has advice or any thoughts (ie you have caught a decent musky in Head lake) please feel free to share."
929651,esoxansteel,2015-08-15 17:17:00,1307,"Never seen or heard of an quality muskies in Head, the good thing is Balsam is a very short drive south on 35"
929653,Rizzo,2015-08-15 17:35:00,4754,"Bingo...when I lived in Barrie we would either go to Head Lake if we had a newbie on board and just wanted to get any musky, but if I had a fisherman on board we would go to balsam!"
929657,misfish,2015-08-15 17:50:00,29133,"There are big fish on head. I have seen them. MAYBE NOT MANY, BUT ARE THERE.   Roger, please make sure there is room for weekend  tenters and toon mouring please. LOL  Good luck on what ever you choose bud."
929658,Rizzo,2015-08-15 18:01:00,4754,Haha...oh you will be welcome to come up for a bit of
929661,misfish,2015-08-15 18:18:00,29133,Haha...oh you will be welcome to come up for a bit of  Why not just move back to Barrie and buy a place on the bay?
929662,Rizzo,2015-08-15 18:20:00,4754,don't tempt me...we loved it there but had other reasons to move. Some day when the kids are grown up and gone I would absolutely come back
929675,pics,2015-08-15 21:53:00,1268,Rush lake is pretty small compared to head lake.. neither has great fishing from what I've heard..
929700,fishindevil,2015-08-16 08:23:00,6254,There is much better fishing a few mins up the highway than head lake that's for sure !!!! And it's very very very busy !!!! The gong show is alive & well there !!!! If you do go fish it during the week!!

Caught an 8 lb. walleye on a musky spinnerbait on Head Lake. The Kawartha record musky of 45 lb. was caught there.  Weird lake, never caught a panfish or perch there. Aside from summer weekends it is quiet."

929733,misfish,2015-08-16 17:14:00,29133,There are two head lakes correct?
929734,glen,2015-08-16 17:19:00,2641,Yep.
929762,Acountdeleted,2015-08-16 19:24:00,2562,I think you guys are thinking of the one in Minden. Much more productive and a lot more walleye and Muskie.
929780,Rizzo,2015-08-16 21:41:00,4754,pretty sure the Head L I am talking about wouldn't have a 45 incher in it never mind 45 pounds
929782,JoshS,2015-08-16 22:38:00,729,My friend is doing some work on rush lake this summer and has fished it quit a bit. He says they are in there but all small.... the lake is tiny.  If anyone has info on this 45lber I would love to see it!
929802,big guy,2015-08-17 01:02:00,414,"pretty sure the Head L I am talking about wouldn't have a 45 incher in it never mind 45 pounds  I caught one there years ago that may have reached that length, did not measure it, buddy in another boat took a picture, but I've never seen it, he said the tail was at my feet though. But like what was mentioned above, I remember the fish being very skinny.  Head, near Norland, is a good lake, multi-species, walleye, muskie, large and smallmouth bass, perch, but it does receive pretty good pressure, much more than when the word started trickling out that walleye were in the lake. Walleye used to be automatic there for me, but it's been a while since I have caught one. I have a buddy who lives on the lake, he still catches some though."
929813,Acountdeleted,2015-08-17 01:53:00,2562,I honestly haven't seen a walleye come out of there in years. The fishing pressure has just been too hard for them to even remotely sustain a population.
929970,mistaredone,2015-08-17 22:17:00,913,"Id buy on Head Lake. I released a skinny 48 years ago, should be still swimming."
929971,mistaredone,2015-08-17 22:19:00,913,Slot eyes were non existent last few trips
929972,mukluk,2015-08-17 22:20:00,196,Rush Lake reminds me of an enlarged swamp. Very shallow; lots of muck and silt especially this time of year when the water table is at its lowest.  Has a small deeper area at the west end of the lake.  Fished Head Lake several times and caught a couple of small walleyes and smallies.  Again the lake has a lot of silt  and  BIG rocks.  (Almost cost me a bottom end on my Yamaha)  Both lakes in my opinion would not be the greatest if the family likes to water ski or swim due to the rocks and muck.   However there is a public beach at the south end of Head Lake with limited parking that provides swimming.
