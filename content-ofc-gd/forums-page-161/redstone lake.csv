930102,fishindevil,2015-08-18 13:55:00,6254,"there is big bass in those lakes mentioned above as i have fished them for alot of years,and yes you have to work very hard for them,but they are there....and yes the forage base has alot to do with itas well as major water fluctuations......"
930106,4x4bassin,2015-08-18 14:15:00,1025,I fish a lake that sounds just like this one . It is a lake trout/smallmouth lake and we find the bass in nothing less then 15 ft of water over rock or they are roaming in schools over deep water chasing baitfish . Find these schools with electronics and drop a jig/minnow into them and hang on !!!

930149,mrpink,2015-08-18 19:31:00,8,"Must say, that was a disappointing week of fishing.   While the cottage and lake were both great, the fishing was really lacking.   We have been renting cottages for a week in the summer for the past several years in the Haliburton area, and this was the least productive.   While I donâ€™t mind spending some time trolling or jigging, I prefer spending time drifting and casting the shore lines in hopes of a nice hit, never happened this week.  I did not land a single fish using any hard baits, only live or tubes worked for me. Previous years we have rented cottages on Soyers or Kashagawigamos Lakes and it was night and day difference.    Last year on Kash, managed to pull in my PB smallie at just over 5lbs, and then found a sweet spot on Soyers where almost every cast ended up with a 2-3lb smallie coming in.  Maybe the difference in temps between this year and last was part of the problem, but I do think there is a difference in the basics of the lake and the fish within them. Thanks to all for the tips and insights, helped with some of the frustrations."
930251,singingdog,2015-08-19 09:45:00,1047,"Soyers and Kash are very different lakes than Redstone: more shallows, more forage, easier fishing. Fishing shield lakes is not your typical ""cast to shore cover"" exercise and can be very frustrating."

Bang on there Dog , as I said in a previous post the shield lakes I fish have the shoreline cover like downed trees and some weeds but are completely void of smallmouth during the daylight hours . The bass in these lakes are generally all open water roamers/feeders and don't head to the shallows until dark or not at all during the summer . These lakes can be frustrating to fish because it does't seem normal but once you figure it out , the fishing can be great !!!"

930424,singingdog,2015-08-20 11:17:00,1047,"One of my favorite open-water smallie techniques for roamers is a take-off on the saltwater popper technique: a popper with a senko underneath. It's a great way to get them to come up, even when they are over 100 FOW. InFisherman did a great video on the technique, but I can't find it. I use a fairly large, brightly coloured popper with the rear treble taken off. Tie on a  3-6' leader with a circle hook and put your favourite stick worm on. It will get hits when nothing else is working."
927838,mrpink,2015-08-05 11:05:00,8,"Have a cottage rented for a week in August on Redstone and a couple questions that I am hoping members here might be able to assist with.Our cottagei s located in Piccadilly Bay, which of the multiple launches would be the best to use?Looking at some maps, it seems the lake is also attached to Pelaw lake, is it possible to boat to or is the river too shallow?Any tips on what works and doesn't work for fishing the lakes? thanks for any insight"
927839,Roy,2015-08-05 11:09:00,13728,I can't help you with those lakes but welcome aboard.
927851,adam lancia,2015-08-05 12:28:00,234,"I think your closest launch to Piccadilly Bay will be the one off of County Road 7/Kennisis Lake Road. You can get to Pelaw through a fairly narrow channel but it's smart to check with the locals about the water depth. Redstone and Pelaw are tires into the Trent Severn system so the water level starts to drop sometime late summer.  As for the fishing, I had the most success with darker coloured flukes and wacky rigged senkos. While I didn't fish for any lake trout, it's my understanding they are out there in the big lake. You can also do some bass fishing on little Redstone, there's a big island in the middle and the west side of that island seems to attract a few boats each evening.  Have fun!"
927886,mrpink,2015-08-05 15:14:00,8,"Thanks for the info.  I thought that would be the closest, but wanted to confirm.   After I launch, I'll take the boat and the wife will drive the truck, which is why I'm looking for the closest one. Is that launch a decent one?  Know some up in the back lakes can be questionable."
927897,adam lancia,2015-08-05 15:30:00,234,"I'm not sure about the quality of the launch, I can see if my cousin could check on it, he lives on little Redstone."
927996,mrpink,2015-08-05 22:33:00,8,Thanks.  The info has been appreciated
928017,adam lancia,2015-08-05 23:08:00,234,"I just spoke with my cousin. He thinks there is concrete buy the first part might be gravel. I'd be willing to bet that if you called the Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve, they'd be able to tell you exactly how that launch looks."
928456,mrpink,2015-08-08 23:43:00,8,"Launch was ok.  Paved as stated for the first part, and got deep nice and quick.  Only thing that wasn't good was a spot to tie up.  Had to get the wife to hold the ropes while I dealt with the truck. I'll see how the fishing goes.....  Thanks for the info"
928490,adam lancia,2015-08-09 05:02:00,234,"I didn't think to ask about somewhere to tie it up. Just shows that I have never owned a boat. Best of luck fishing, enjoy!"
928562,tomkat,2015-08-09 16:56:00,246,Had some great smallmouth fishing there crank baits tubes all the usual stuff.
928945,mrpink,2015-08-11 13:56:00,8,"Fishing has been tough.  Cranks, spinners, body baits, plastics, live baits and best has been a 2lb.  Found lots of spots that look like they should hold some beasts, bays with lots of dead heads and timber stacked up on the bottom, just not getting the results.  Any suggestions on which area of the lakes I should be trying?"
928948,Dan668,2015-08-11 14:04:00,1120,"That area is pretty tough for size, on kawagama,  i boated a bunch but none were over 2lb. Most came in 6-12fow by rocks on topwater,  wacky rigged senkos,  and dropshot.  Never fished that lake before though,  cant offer any spots"
928966,sneak_e_pete,2015-08-11 16:52:00,540,I have fished it a few times with a relative who used to own a cottage there.  Try some of the deep drops (sheer wall straight down to deep) with a drop shot.
928971,jimmer,2015-08-11 17:08:00,2730,I would also say to move into 12 -15 feet and use a drop shot with a senko. Don't be afraid to go deeper though.
929237,mrpink,2015-08-12 21:07:00,8,"Moved to deeper water as suggested and better luck.  Finding drops of about 25-30 being the best.  Still no monsters, but getting bigger and more numbers. Thanks for the tips"
929295,adam lancia,2015-08-13 03:41:00,234,Nice!
929302,Freshtrax,2015-08-13 04:47:00,2215,Wen all else fails find a nice mid lake hump.
929311,sneak_e_pete,2015-08-13 11:30:00,540,Good to hear!!!
929450,fishindevil,2015-08-14 09:01:00,6254,Yup go deeper and finesse them with dropshot or tube !!!! You will probly get less fish bit will be bigger & better !!!! I have been doing both the shallow game & deep game for smallies last week or 2  and there are atull some decent fish shallow for sure !!!! Inside weedleines can be awesome this time of year !!!
929451,singingdog,2015-08-14 10:51:00,1047,"On lakes like Redstone, the big smallies are roamers: keying on schools of moving baitfish more than on specific structure. You may find them suspended over 100 FOW one moment, up in the shallows the next. Watch the birds, use your electronics."
929452,turtle,2015-08-14 11:09:00,274,"I fish a similar lake up the road from Redstone and find it difficult to find a smallie over 1 pound.  Lots of 8-12 inch sized bass however.  I once caught a 3 pound fish but that's it.  I've caught small fish in 5-30 FOW and suspended in deeper water.  I think its due to the lack of bait fish, at least in the lake I'm on.  Last two weeks I caught and kept a few lake trout 19-22 inches and their bellies were empty apart from bugs -maybe spiny water fleas."
929464,adam lancia,2015-08-14 12:49:00,234,Which lake is that turtle?
929476,Dan668,2015-08-14 13:56:00,1120,"A few of them have little to no forage,  kawagama for example,  the fish were tiny,  light in colour,  some looked sick"
930075,turtle,2015-08-18 11:33:00,274,Which lake is that turtle? Kennisis
930094,adam lancia,2015-08-18 13:35:00,234,"Kennisis That's the lake my parents cottage is on, I know your struggles lol..."
