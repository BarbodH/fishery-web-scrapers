Not that it likely would change anyone here's mind, but does it not strike anyone as odd that he is always the one leader who is absent from the more ""progressive"" community events like gay pride? He certainly knows his voter base - upper middle class, rural, religious, families. Personally I'm tired of being paralleled with the US, or in some cases passed by in terms of social progression. This country doesn't need the ""Republican Lite"" Party anymore. Right on! Very well put!!"

But the real conspiracy theorist in me believes he is doing this to in fact help the Clinton's. Think about it... he is known to be friends with the Clinton's, and would most certainly scare away any fence sitting Republicans, leaving only the bat-guano insane types left to vote for him. This is all assuming Clinton wins the Democrat nomination (which I hope she doesn't since she's as much of capitalists as Trump is - I'm actually hoping Sanders takes it to bring in some much needed social change down there), but if Trump scares off a third of the swing voters from the Republican vote, the Democrats will win again. Classic intentional vote splitting tactic.  While I'm on the topic of vote splitting, I would rather see the Liberals and NDP form a coalition than see Harper win again.

We done messed up and no way can it be fixed(not just us, most countries as well).  And im not really against trade. Im against rediculous trade.  Here ill give you an example  When I worked for weyethaueser, we produced canadian lumber. We sold it all to the US at a price lower then it cost to produce. Then canada needs lumber. Instead of using our own resource, we buy back the lumber we produced at a markup plus currency exchange.  Does that make any sense to youse at all????  Im the nutty one?  Please...

We need nothing imported because we have what we need. Countries need us more then we need them.  But, with basically zero military presence and so many asinine policies we are in a place where literally nothing can improve drastically.  It can get worse, or a little better. Thats it.  Canada should have never bent to OPEC nor to the corperatization of our country by US and China.

Years ago when I was taking marketing the #1 trade partner of the US was Ontario, world wide, #2 was the rest of Canada. Go to any grocery store, big box store, car dealer wherever consumer goods are sold and you will find that at least 60% of the products we buy are from US owned corps, probably more I can't quantify the number right now. Made in Mexico or China but US corps. Right or wrong that's what we have. Hell even China with their billions of consumers could not be self sustained as Chairman Mao envisioned. They had to open their ports to imports so they could do many things including export. and joining the 21st Century. A manufacturing or mining company, to name a few  in Canada can not survive today in a domestic only market. See Stelco Inc. Algoma Steel, Sydney Steel, Alta Steel. The list is interminable. As long as we were building a post WW2 Canada it worked. All the boats are built, the bridges and roads, the plants and skyscrapers. Now what?  As far as who is married to whom, I don't get what you mean to say there. We are married to the Yanks, and are kept barefoot and pregnant.

I get that some people hate Harper because, well, seems like everybody else is doing it.  Why on earth would you want to vote in an NDP government who say one thing in Quebec and the opposite in the rest of Canada? Didn't we learn how frustrating that was under the Liberals? We are talking about the Energy East Pipeline for one. They are all for it when talking in western Canada. In Ontario they are for building a $10 billion dollar refinery in Sarnia to process Alberta oil sands oil delivered through the pipeline. In Quebec they are against it.  How about their promise to make it easier for Quebec to separate from Canada? This doesn't bother anyone?  How about their own War On Science - their luddite views on GMO? You want this governing a modern country?  What about their views on TFSA's and CPP? Their views show a complete lack of understanding of how lower income people save for retirement and save for the futures of their families.  You really want this?"

"" In Switzerland and Germany, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and is now banned.[5] In Germany, the Animal Welfare Act states that ""no-one may cause an animal pain, suffering or harm without good reason"".[6] This leaves no legal basis for catch and release due to its argued inherent lack of ""good reason"", and thus personal fishing is solely allowed for immediate food consumption. Additionally, it is against the law to release fish back into the water if they are above minimum size requirements and aren't a protected species or in closed season.

930001,Canuck2fan,2015-08-18 00:37:00,1444,That's a good start....Tax and spend Liberals....  VS spend like drunken sailors and don't tax conservatives..... LOL  The actual numbers from the past 40 years DO NOT support the contention that the federal conservatives are good with managing money. Mulroney 263 Billion in deficit spending 0 balanced budgets. Harper 8 in row of deficit spending 156 billion in deficit spending so far and climbing. And unless Nigel can Wright a cheque for 600 million according to independent PBO the budget is NOT balanced this year as the conservatives would like us to believe.
930005,KLINKER,2015-08-18 00:44:00,256,Does Mr. Harper still have time to resign and get a full pension before the cuts kick in? He must be thinking about it.

Like HELLO this is your chance, convince me!!!!  When elections could be called at the PM's pleasure it was acceptable for parties to have a week to 10 days to have their plans vetted and put forth....  This time folks you KNEW election day was going to be October 19th 2015 for four years.

Not that I'm letting Duffy off the hook, it looks like he swindled the system. But it also looks like the system was easily able to be swindled. Get rid of the senate, it's nothing but a bunch of appointed hacks and butt-kissers. There are some good people in there to be sure, but for the most part it just isn't worth the bother.  And I don't want to take the elected senate route.

He has also given them up to 21 days to cap newly opened oil wells. 21 friggin days of pure crude flowing into the water.. all in the name of what?
