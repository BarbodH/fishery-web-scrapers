928719,porkpie,2015-08-10 17:25:00,2521,All stores
928883,joeybacala,2015-08-11 02:28:00,63,I'll have to check it out. I hope all stores.
928884,Smokercrafty,2015-08-11 02:32:00,227,Thanks for the heads up. I'll be going to check this week sometime for sure!
928894,PUMP KNOWS,2015-08-11 02:58:00,937,Whats TSC?  Do they have a store in Toronto?
928907,bow slayer,2015-08-11 04:38:00,1074,no stores in T.O but probably one just outside  http://www.tscstores.com/Default.aspx
928980,PUMP KNOWS,2015-08-11 17:41:00,937,Thanks bowslayer
928990,lookinforwalleye,2015-08-11 19:06:00,4399,Well if we are gunna buy a bunch more stuff we really don`t need we might as well get it at a discount.... .....Thanks for the heads up!!
929023,wildeye rainbow,2015-08-11 21:38:00,123,Lots of good deals for sure.  I picked up several packages of Gulp minnows for 2 bucks a pack.  A newbie that we are taking up on our annual canoing/fishing trip picked up all kinds of tackle and 2 rods and reels.
930048,jjcanoe,2015-08-18 03:20:00,744,"Picked up some Scott rod holders for$13!! Sorry, none left in the London /St. Thomas area"
930052,porkpie,2015-08-18 03:45:00,2521,My local is pretty well cleared out of anything good now.  Luckily I did a lot of the clearing!
930130,bobowski,2015-08-18 17:23:00,360,Thanks for the heads up picked up a few things today. 
930139,PUMP KNOWS,2015-08-18 18:39:00,937,Nice haul!  How much was the rapala propbait?
930171,bobowski,2015-08-18 21:35:00,360,The Pro Bait was $7. Got the cheapy Rod/reel combo for $5 (75% off) to add to the collection of spare rods up north for when friends come up. Pickings were pretty slim at the Orangeville store.
930172,misfish,2015-08-18 21:49:00,29133,"The  one in Barrie had nothing real great.  It looked like they jumped the regular prices and then did thier discount.  Local bait bucket had better prices IMO.  Not spaming here, just saying."
930173,porkpie,2015-08-18 22:05:00,2521,"I bought worm harnesses for $1-1.50 each, johnson silver minnows for. $2 each. A bunch of xraps and husky jerks for $5-5.50 each.  Bell weights and some terminal tackle for peanuts.  I saw ugly sticks for $25, okuma rigger rods go for $22.  Lots if spoons and mepps musky killers for great prices.  Overall good deals to be had, but they are getting out of fishing tackle completely so that's the end of it. You pretty much had to get there at the start of the sale.  A few of us cleaned out a lot of the good stuff on the first day at our local tsc.  All that is left is crap now."
930174,pics,2015-08-18 22:32:00,1268,Minnow traps were $6.. not bad.. some of their prices were a little higher to start at.. I also picked up a battery box( the larger one) for $11..
930247,adolson,2015-08-19 08:29:00,783,"Thanks for the tip! I hit my local store up last week after seeing this post and picked up a bunch of random useful stuff. Some terminal tackle, some Little Cleos, some Blue Fox #3s, a spinnerbait, and some other random stuff - about $40-50 worth. Woulda got a lot more, too, if they'd had more!"
930250,fishindevil,2015-08-19 08:52:00,6254,The manager of my local TSC said that they will not ever be carrying fishing tackle again that's why they are blowing it out  so they said anyways
