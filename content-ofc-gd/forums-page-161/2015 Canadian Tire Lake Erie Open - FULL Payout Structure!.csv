927683,grimsbylander,2015-08-04 17:53:00,3016,Looks like a great event Jay. Why the Chippawa launch? That's 26 km run just to the mouth of the river.
927719,JayClay,2015-08-04 19:44:00,16,The idea of Chippawa is so we can run the event no matter what the lake does. Crystal beach is subject to wind and limited parking. Port Colborne is the only other option but if its too rough you have to move it or delay. So the tourney will run even if the lake has to be closed (obviously hoping that isn't the case!!!)
927760,grimsbylander,2015-08-04 23:15:00,3016,Sounds great. I'll be fishing it for sure.
