929935,Fisherpete,2015-08-17 20:40:00,1814,"Once in a while I like to take a break from chasing big toothy critters, and enjoy the simple art of skipping a plastic worm under docks for largemouth. At my cottage, it's not even a question if you are going to catch bass - the only question is how many and how big. My little guy Tyler loves bass fishing also - and can cast that Spiderman rod better than most! Last two trips out he managed to catch a few really nice ones, and I did too    It was THIS big.   HEY you said they have no teeth!     Wow dad, nice one!         Pair of beauties caught yesterday on my first and second casts of the day!   "
