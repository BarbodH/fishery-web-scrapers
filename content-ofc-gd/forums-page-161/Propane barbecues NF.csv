Some how I believe I heard you don't need lava rocks for them ,but I have used them in any other propane barbecue I have bought.Googled a bit,seems you don't need them.?.What are your thoughts guys.?I have a new bag of rocks,not afraid to use them,but if I don't need?.Pros and cons I guess,or any other ideas are more then welcome .Thanks.  Dave."
