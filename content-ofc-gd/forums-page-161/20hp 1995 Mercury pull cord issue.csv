930378,buick14,2015-08-19 22:43:00,741,"Hey guys,  I have a 20hp merc which has lately been giving me issues.   When I pull the chord, sometimes it either snaps back, or I go to put some balls into it, and the cord stops me midway, hurting my elbow. I've also noticed the power isn't always all there, although it ""seems"" to be idling fine.   I'm running new gas, with sea foam , and changed the plugs; same issues.  The issues are intermittent, but frequent....especially frequent is the lack of power issue...  I've heard idling, punks gas and plugs.  Tried all except timing, but I don't know how the timing would just go out like this?  Any and all help would b great"
930413,dhickey,2015-08-20 03:42:00,1038,Sounds like it may be time to take it to a marine mechanic . The motor is 20 yrs old. The recoil may be worn out causing it to lock up. As for the power check the compression and work back from there.  Good luck.
930414,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-20 03:48:00,10439,Is it a 2 stroke or 4 stroke? If it's a 4 stroke it very well could be an issue with the decompression valve.
930420,buick14,2015-08-20 10:28:00,741,"Shes a 2 stroke...  Thanks for the input.   Like myself,  this motor is affraid of the doctor."
930422,misfish,2015-08-20 11:00:00,29133,I had a 20 that did the exact thing. Rip the handle right out of my hand. That stung. I do believe the old boy that looked at it reduced the recoil pressure/spring. It was fine after that.
930440,Tybo,2015-08-20 13:10:00,1373,Pull cord backlash and poor running would lead me too cracked rings.
930448,sauce,2015-08-20 13:57:00,219,I just went through the same recoil problem with my 1997 20 hp mercury 2 stroke. Take the recoil assembly off the top of the motor. Underneath there will be a few keys that engage the flywheel. Make sure they move free. They should lock in place turning the motor over when you pull. If they are worn or dirty they could be locking in a position that prevents normal function. It's an easy check. 5 minutes to remove 20 minutes with a q tip and some wd40. 5 minutes back together. You'll know on the first pull. Also sounds like some carb adjustments might help.
930449,sauce,2015-08-20 14:02:00,219,"Check all your fuel lines and fittings. If the primer bulb won't stay firm, you have air entering the fuel line. Motor will run but performance will be hampered."
930596,buick14,2015-08-21 01:58:00,741,Lots of good insight here guys...ill have a look
930638,Ksword,2015-08-21 11:24:00,40,Pretty sure that you have an issue with the ignition timing on that one....
930693,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-21 17:52:00,8243,If there is air entering the fuel line would it not leak gas when primed and not running?
