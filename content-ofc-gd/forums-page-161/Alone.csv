930625,bobowski,2015-08-21 05:41:00,360,Wow. Great show surprised it was the last episode. Very well done by history channel. Alan had some very good quotes. Makes you think and put life in perspective.
930628,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-21 06:46:00,8243,"It's on right now, the first I have ever seen and the last episode to boot. I don't want to watch so I can see reruns."
930629,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-21 06:51:00,8243,Man the guy receives a cheque for what was it 500K ? and starts listing how he is going to help others with the money without batting an eye. A real winner in my books. I won't say who in case it would be a spoiler for those that may have missed.
930639,cram,2015-08-21 11:45:00,1733,"It's on right now, the first I have ever seen and the last episode to boot. I don't want to watch so I can see reruns. You can stream the entire season right from their website (in full screen, HD)  http://www.history.ca/alone/"
930657,Sinker,2015-08-21 13:38:00,8692,That Alan is a good guy! I was hoping for a little more in depth filming on the folow up show though! Where was Sam for that anyways?
930667,Tim Mills,2015-08-21 14:16:00,476,Enjoyed the show.  Thought the Georgia guy had the best chance.  Impressed by canoe guy and was surprised the Mass guy lasted as long as he did.
930691,adolson,2015-08-21 17:29:00,783,"This series was awesome! But they sure didn't show Sam too much until the last few episodes... I have to wonder why that is. I didn't picture him winning, but they really focused on some of the other guys by comparison. I was really impressed with Lucas and Alan made me laugh a few times. I hope they do a second season!  Other than Dick Proenneke's vids, Surviroman, and even Naked and Afraid, I don't have much else to watch in this vein. (I find Ray Mears super-knowledgeable, but his shows aren't very interesting to me, and Bear Grylls is a fraud and a joke).  I just caught a new show Les Stroud is doing that he has his teen son with him. It was on the Travel Channel that I never watch. Check it out.  Do you mean Survivorman and Son? I think there were only a couple episodes, and it isn't that new. Logan, just spent some months battling cancer at Sick Kid's in Toronto, and I don't think he'd be out filming again so soon (maybe I'm wrong). Then Les broke some ribs when, IIRC, a vehicle overturned more recently and was airlifted back to Toronto... I think his most-recent televised shows have been Survivorman Bigfoot."
930697,cram,2015-08-21 19:11:00,1733,That Alan is a good guy! I was hoping for a little more in depth filming on the folow up show though! Where was Sam for that anyways? I wonder how Sam reacted after finding out he was #2.  That'd be hard. It must have been frustrating for those guys to not know how many others were left at any given time.
930702,Sinker,2015-08-21 19:33:00,8692,"I wonder the same, and also wonder if that's why he wasn't part of the in depth final episode.....  S."
929529,cram,2015-08-14 18:23:00,1733,"Is anyone else watching Alone on the History channel?  There are lots of ""outdoor survival"" type shows on the tube, but to me this one is easily the best.  The premise is simple -- drop 10 guys on Vancouver Island (individually) to fend for themselves with limited supplies, and the last one to call for rescue wins $500k..   It's not as spiced up or action-filled as a Bear Gryllis or Survivor Man show....but maybe that's a good thing. Just 10 guys trying to outlast each other while freezing, starving, or scared to death from the bears/wolves/mountain lions wandering around their camps. Anyway, worth checking out if you haven't seen it. Recommend you watch from the beginning of the season if you can.  http://www.history.ca/alone/  "
929532,Sinker,2015-08-14 19:10:00,8692,"Yep, been following since the beginning. Pretty cool stuff. They are starting to break down now though....i was surprised Lucas bailed last night! I had him for the winner!!  S."
929534,cram,2015-08-14 19:17:00,1733,"Yep, been following since the beginning. Pretty cool stuff. They are starting to break down now though....i was surprised Lucas bailed last night! I had him for the winner!!  S. Had him as well.  Thought he was doing the best (and didn't think it was even close).   Him and that Florida guy (or wherever he's from) seemed the most balanced and comfortable (relatively speaking)."
929541,Sinker,2015-08-14 19:58:00,8692,"Yep, I'm rooting for the georgia dude now. Sad I can't remember his name lol"
929543,davey buoy,2015-08-14 20:25:00,5505,"I need to start watching again,is the fella that built the canoe still in?liked that guy !"
929545,DanD,2015-08-14 20:37:00,2223,Thanks for the heads up and the link. Watched the first episode and really enjoyed it.  Thanks again.  Dan.
929547,Beavertail,2015-08-14 20:50:00,331,"Sounds like my kind of show, will have to start watching."
929550,LefroyFisherman,2015-08-14 21:01:00,602,"I have been watching that show also, very interesting, and it's great they film themselves. I thought it would be funny, if there were two guys that just decided to stay there forever, build a house lol."
929551,Sinker,2015-08-14 21:04:00,8692,"That was Lucas. He bailed last night! I was shocked, he was doing really good out there!!  S."
929552,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-14 21:10:00,956,"Not a bad show.  It makes Survivor look like Disney Land.  Anyways we PVR every week.  Haven't watched the last episode, but thanks to Sinker I know who bailed.  No worries dude."
929556,LefroyFisherman,2015-08-14 21:34:00,602,"I always liked watching survivor man with les stroud, filming himself"
929557,cram,2015-08-14 21:36:00,1733,"I'm surprised by how tough it's been for those guys to make a go of it there.  Figured that food would be pretty plentiful, but seemingly not.  btw - what happened to Georgia guy's fish trap? I figured that was going to feed him for the rest of the show."
929564,Beavertail,2015-08-14 21:56:00,331,"I remember watching a show called 'the Barefooted Bushman' hosted by Rob Bredl.  It was a great show, not all jazzed up, just a guy surviving off the land, eating everything he could catch. Very knowledgeable host."
929818,cram,2015-08-17 02:03:00,1733,"The poor dude eating a mouse or two a day (which is apparently all of 35 calories)....seems to me you should be able to find more food there. Obviously these guys know what they're doing, but shouldn't that water be full of little fish, crabs, clams, etc?"
929829,Sinker,2015-08-17 02:36:00,8692,I agree. Your wasting your time not using the oceans resources. Ive been saying the same thing about him.
929830,e-z-out,2015-08-17 03:01:00,1052,Next week should be great 2 men remain. Who do you guys think will make the call next?
929854,mr blizzard,2015-08-17 12:16:00,1589,"Thanks Cram ,will check it out"
929856,Raf,2015-08-17 12:39:00,3495,"Alan will win, the other guy will die trying."
929918,Sinker,2015-08-17 19:42:00,8692,"Yes, Alan...that's his name.  S."
930062,bobowski,2015-08-18 04:57:00,360,"I agree. This is a great show. I cant believe how fast the first few guys quit. I would think that $500,000 would really motivate you. You can really tell that the isolation is getting to them now. Its going to be interesting seeing how long they can last. I think that Alan will last the longest unless the young guy can find another food resource."
930597,Sinker,2015-08-21 02:04:00,8692,Just started on history channel!
930602,e-z-out,2015-08-21 02:31:00,1052,Sam doesn't look like  he's going to make it one more day.
930612,cram,2015-08-21 03:54:00,1733,What a great show. Really well done.
930616,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-21 04:55:00,8243,"I just caught a new show Les Stroud is doing that he has his teen son with him. It was on the Travel Channel that I never watch. Check it out.  We were caught in a lake effect storm on Long Point Bay ice fishing 25 years ago and got stuck there over night. You would think we would have plenty to eat with all those perch there, nothing. It was reality for sure. Especially when the wood ran out before mid night. Long story and not fun."
930617,Joey,2015-08-21 05:00:00,9122,"Great show, I like it too.  Ya, Sam is hurtin."
