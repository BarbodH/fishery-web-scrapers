He might even break the Guinness Record for Marathon Drumming at the end.  His daughter Jersey, now 2, was born with a Congenial Heart Defect.  You may have seen Steve and his daughter on CP24 last week and Y108 is covering the event throughout the day as well.  Stop by the Burlington Music Centre at 2311 New Street if you live nearby. Good tunes there! http://www.cardiackids.ca/drumathon.shtml"
