929994,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-18 00:16:00,479,"I've recently acquired my first shallow spool spinning reel and it came with 12lb fluoro and had a chance to fish with the reel over the weekend. Obviously, it doesn't cast very far so I'd like to swap out the fluro with braidâ€¦like 15lb or maybe 20lb. The question is, does a shallow spool spinning reel require any backing? I've read some places that it doesn't require backing, but I'm thinking that the braid would start to slip.  Thoughts?  Thanks!"
930009,porkpie,2015-08-18 01:05:00,2521,It will slip.  I only own one of those shallow spool deals but you still need 3 or 4 wraps of mono before you put on the braid.
930013,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-18 01:24:00,479,"Thanks for the advice. I just came across someone mentioning plumbers tape, which could work and doesn't take up much line capacity. And that wouldn't leave any sticky residue.  Will see how that works out.  I did manage to boat around a 30"" pike with the shallow spool, surprisingly."
930081,OhioFisherman,2015-08-18 12:28:00,6623,I don't know if the spool being shallow is the problem with the casting distance? A 30 inch pike certainly shouldn't spool you with 12# test line.
930091,sneak_e_pete,2015-08-18 13:18:00,540,You can back it with a strip of electrical tape also
930099,manitoubass2,2015-08-18 13:44:00,11391,"I can tie braid on without slippage(pats self on back?)  But i still use electrical tape  Works great, and its easy"
930167,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-18 21:11:00,479,"Thanks for the awesome advice! I managed to spool up around 87yds of 20lb PP. That should be enough for casting and hopefully with enough line in case some bigger fish decide to make some runs.  When I casted for the pike, it was already pretty close to the spool, hence my worries about not having enough line. We actually boated towards the fish to save me some line. lol  Either way, the reel is pretty darn amazing and look forward to many more outings with it. Looking forward to some piggies in the fall!  Thanks again fellas!"
