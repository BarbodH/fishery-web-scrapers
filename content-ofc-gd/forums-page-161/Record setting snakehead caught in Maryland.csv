929403,Locnar,2015-08-13 21:32:00,645,"I'd like to go there and catch some. Do what little I can to help out, by eating as many snakeheads as I can catch."

929522,aplumma,2015-08-14 17:58:00,6896,My best from that body of water is 15.5 lbs and it was delicious.   http://potomacsnakehead.com/  here is the link to see some of the tournaments captures   Art
929561,mattp33,2015-08-14 21:52:00,290,"Anyone ever eaten these?  Seems to be a lot of recipes out there.  I got 2 on wednesday at sparrow, I threw them back not knowing they were invasive?  Do we have to destroy these if we catch them?"
929565,aplumma,2015-08-14 22:02:00,6896,"Matt you most likely did not catch snakeheads up North. They are most likely bowfin.  https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7urNB0z1Ps"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen> [/size]   They are a different fish that until seen side by side are easily mistaken.   Art"

929903,mattp33,2015-08-17 17:46:00,290,"ah yes, I think I may have knew that but thought they were a similar fish.  Thanks for the clarification, can you eat bowfin? lol"
929986,John Bacon,2015-08-17 23:57:00,3277,"They do look similar, but I don't think they are very closely related.  From what I understand, bowfin are not very good table fare."
