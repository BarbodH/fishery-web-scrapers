929807,chris.brock,2015-08-17 01:37:00,4053,"There's an old outpost built in the 40's in the Chapleau region. There's very little online information about the place. The outfitter doesn't advertise and won't even answer his phone.  Adam posted a while back here on OFC, ""Does anybody know anything about the ""Chutes""? He included a picture of a cabin nestled in spruce trees, perched on a rock, over looking a pretty rapids and falls.  I had found the same information Adam had come across. I had actually chatted with Richard (the owner of the Chutes) a few years back. He only answered his phone because he thought he knew who the caller was, a friend calling him back.  It took dozens of polite voice mail messages I left for Richard, but this previous winter, my party booked the Chutes.  I sent a cheque for a deposit to a guy who doesn't answer his phone or return messages, and hoped for the best.  Well, we actually went.    This was kind of funny. Mike Borger's forum doesn't get tonnes of activity. There's great discussions and reports on there though. In the late winter, a guy's first post is ""Does anybody know anything about the ""Chutes""? This set off a long chain of replies from guys who wanted to know more and from guys who had been there at some point. There was also talk about Richard's phobia of the telephone.  I love the historic, old camps and this was like an exclusive club I was going to become a member of.   Getting to the Chutes is a long process. We drove to Foleyet. Air Ivanhoe flies Richard's clients into a camp called the Pines    , then it's a 25 km boat ride to the Chutes.  The Pines    25 km takes a long time when the boats are loaded with gear/ food/ beer, but it was a beautiful evening and we all enjoyed the ride.    It is a truly unique spot for a camp.    Below the Chutes, is likely the most prolific walleye spot on the river.    You can fish above or below the Chutes. We had a lawn tractor/ trailer to haul gear, outboards and gas cans around. The tractor was also used for recreational trail riding.  The lower river was surprisingly deep with an average of 15 and holes to 35      Above, Frog Lake was better for pike. Depths over 120"". Big head, no body.      Teagan won the big pike award at only 10 lbs with this fish he didn't want to hold.   It's a great camp for family trip.    We lit fires on the beach.     We nailed some beauty pickerels right below the Chutes.    Selfie    Casting Quinkies after dark from the shore below the Chutes was a blast.      With our headlights, we could see the glowing eyes below the Chutes.    We all said the Chutes was a great pick. Another trip come and gone.    The fishing was a little better than I expected. It was close to the lowest total of 340 fish we've experienced on our trips.  Thanks to Ryan Couts. He gave me some small scale, detailed maps from his almost 30 years of Chutes fishing. We hear ya, the Chutes rocks!"

929836,Moosebunk,2015-08-17 03:29:00,3970,"I'll take that phone number and start with the calls now... maybe in a decade I'll get there too.  Seriously tho, great spot off the beaten path up there in some of God's best country.  Cool report this one with some dandy fish as well."

929857,chris.brock,2015-08-17 12:47:00,4053,"Awesome Chris! Was looking forward to this report. Would love to make it there sometime, mostly for the recreational lawn tractor riding...  Without much ground clearance and crappy tires, the tractor would get hung up a lot. We did bushwack it back to Skink Lake.  You guys leaving soon? I hope you didn't have to cancel.  Ha, that's awesome.  It slipped my mind that you were heading there is summer.  Looks like you guys had a pretty good trip.   What was the cabin like?  Cabin was great. 4 bedrooms and a bunkie we didn't use. 2 ice cold fridges. A CB radio to chat with Rodney at Gosenda Lodge. No BBQ sucked for steaks and burgers though, and the mice and squirrels are running around inside.  Big mound of bear poo was left while we were out fishing, but never saw the bear."
