Looks big so maybe on monster pike and musky ? Guess they're targeting the offshore marlin/tuna etc crowd.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gofishcam/gofish-cam?ref=jellop&utm_source=jellop&utm_medium=ocpm&utm_content=fish"

930034,Freshtrax,2015-08-18 02:41:00,2215,I'd love one with live feed.
930043,John Bacon,2015-08-18 03:07:00,3277,I would be nervous about attaching an expensive camera to my fishing line.  I guess you could attach it to some heavey line and run a light leader so that you will still have the camera if lose your lure.
930078,dave524,2015-08-18 12:14:00,4508,"Found the footage I was talking about, think the camera was maybe attached to the cannonball, good clarity for 60 foot down.  http://vid138.photob...zps2eey4rhv.mp4"
930086,John Bacon,2015-08-18 12:52:00,3277,I know some people have tried runnig GoPros off their cannon balls.  I have thought of trying it with my Muvi brand camera.

930245,adolson,2015-08-19 08:20:00,783,"You can build a housing pretty easily for a GoPro or SJCAM style camera (and possibly others) with some ABS or PVC pieces and a weight of some kind. I am strongly considering doing it myself, just in case I get some cool footage.  Here's an example of how to build it:    Live feeds don't really work too well when the signal has to be sent through water, not to mention if your line and cam is far out, so I wouldn't really worry too much about that.  I have an SJ4000 Wifi (genuine, not the cheaper clones) that I got from Amazon for about $115, and I'm really quite happy with it, considering the alternatives. Compatible with GoPro mounts, too. I've only really used it at the beach and on my ATC so far, but it's been great. Hopefully I'll get some footage while fishing sometime to enhance a decent report, we'll see."
