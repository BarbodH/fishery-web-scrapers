More so with the extended family. Gotta be making baby food. Got to grow more to fed them extra mouths. Grandkids also keeping me hopping. They love attention. Little Savannah is now 9 weeks old. man can she eat (comes by her appetite naturally). Going to be making a lot of frozen baby food to keep her fed. Can't wait til I can get some quality fishing time in. Heck, I'm lucky if I get a hour to live vicariously on the fishing sites. Catch up with you all later."
