282974,ciceri,2008-12-22 22:58:00,535,"does anyone know if i can get a tow bar for this portable hut, or easily attach one to it?  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...408474396672364"
282977,Terry,2008-12-22 23:02:00,14456,"I put this one from HT, on a clam hut  because it was so cheap http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_fall08/ice...ht_shelters.pdf and from what I see it will work on any hut"
282979,Guest skeeter99,2008-12-22 23:06:00,0,yeah I put a frabill top bar on my clam pro to LOL!!!! the cheap guy I am LOL!!!  way cheaper than the clam brand and will work for any portable just drill holes in different location   really any tow bar will work
282983,ciceri,2008-12-22 23:10:00,535,"where can i get a tow bar without getting it over the internet? Lindsay, Beaverton, Markham, or Penetang areas would be good. Or anywhere between them."
282985,Guest skeeter99,2008-12-22 23:12:00,0,lebarons in markham  tromblays in orillia  gagnons in oshawa  ctc in port perry (look in snowmobile section)  basspro in vaughn  look in the yellow pages for tackle stores some small shops carry a few huts and the tow bars
282988,ciceri,2008-12-22 23:17:00,535,"okay, yea i saw them in Tromblys Saturday, but forget the price. I'll check the CTC in lindsay and midland. And i'll see if my dad knows where Lebarons"
282991,Terry,2008-12-22 23:23:00,14456,"lebarons, markham, thats  where I picked mine up from"
282992,BassAsin,2008-12-22 23:28:00,806,"i guess i'm just one of those cheap guys who built one out of 3/4 "" copper piper a heavy hinge and a tobbagan! hahaha"
282993,ciceri,2008-12-22 23:34:00,535," haha, i would def. do that if i could."
282998,BassAsin,2008-12-22 23:39:00,806,"i dont know how well copper would hold up on the weight of a portable shack my portable is a small two person made of black fabrene tarp and 1/2"" copper pipe it weighs in jsut under 30 lbs"
283004,ciceri,2008-12-22 23:50:00,535,"yea, that beast weighs 75 pounds lol. plus my gear. I'll see if i can find anything to use tomorrow"
283008,BassAsin,2008-12-23 00:01:00,806,a small trick if you are stuck is use a rope on the right and left side of your bumber but run it through a 3-4 foot chunk of abs or pvc pipe first so when u slow down or turn it doesnt pass/hit you! thats if you are stuck i used this method for several years before i built the portable
283026,ciceri,2008-12-23 00:57:00,535,"thats an excellent idea, and yes i am stuck, lmao."
283034,misfish,2008-12-23 01:22:00,29133," Although this method does do the trick,you wont get it by the opp or the mnr if you sre stopped. Your trailering object must me  firmly/directly attached to your sled/atv."
283037,ciceri,2008-12-23 01:32:00,535," even if im just on the lake?  im not really worried about it, i dont see them around where i fish, but still, just incase."
283121,irishfield,2008-12-23 05:15:00,26272,I ordered mine on line.. along with the cover that doesn't come with the darn things!  If you wanna drop by and take measurements to make your own up Ciceri... you're more than welcome to! I have the Trekker.
283126,BassAsin,2008-12-23 05:30:00,806,this is true only if u are really stuck and the authorities are glad to hear you did all that you could because the winter hit so hard so fast you still have not got one built and this was the safest way you could get your gear to the lake on a short notice
283170,Fisherman,2008-12-23 12:22:00,7201,I don't think so...
283171,Terry,2008-12-23 12:37:00,14456,"well it's not like me to disagree but from the way I read the law if you had rope inside pvc pipe with no slack it would be within the rules which states ""Towing ,A rigid tow-bar must be used when towing"" pvc pipe is rigid, you might need 2 to make a triangle to be truly rigid but it is rigid  what yeah think"
283206,irishfield,2008-12-23 15:01:00,26272,I think we'll continue to pull the second guys hut.. behind the first guys hut.. behind the cutter... with rope !  Where we go the only thing the OPP check for.. is your fishing licence! lol. Never have asked for ownerships/insurance. Have asked to see fish pics on camera and all and all are some great guys.
283235,ciceri,2008-12-23 16:14:00,535,"talked to my dad lastnight on the phone, and we figured something out. Instead of this portable with the plastic sleigh, we're going to get one that can pack up into a bag, like this: http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...408474396672364  And then we can get something like this and put a box on it to fit all our stuff http://www.royaldistributing.com/ShoppingC...ow2009/295.html the sleigh kit  The reason for this is because we go into the islands, honey harbour, and we want to try Mcrae and Go Home Lake's this year, so when we're just riding in the open to get to our spots, we can use the sleigh, then when we go in the islands, we can just carry everything on our backs. Because a sleigh would be just to much hassle going over bumpy islands."
283240,Fisherman,2008-12-23 16:30:00,7201,"Well now we can can take this one further...all you have to do is whizz on the rope and let it freeze, I suppose it might stay stiff for a moment.  Now go look up rigid in the dictionary and quit using the East Simcoe Dictionary.."
283249,BassAsin,2008-12-23 16:53:00,806,"either dictionary you use it was a ""if your stuck"" idea its just somehting i did in the past for a long time! lol wizz on the rope"
