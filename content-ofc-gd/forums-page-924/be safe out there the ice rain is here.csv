283474,irishfield,2008-12-24 04:22:00,26272,Thanks Mike... another 5 or 6 inches of snow here since around 2 PM. Supposed to snow all night and turn to rain around 10am tomorrow.
283477,waterwolf,2008-12-24 04:38:00,556,"was in the big city of t.o. for the better part of the day,driving was rediculus. 2.5 hrs. to get to brmpton . 35kms .with 4x4 guidance system.   it's actully entertaining  if you keep the right frame of mind .  be safe out there ."
283494,brifishrgy,2008-12-24 07:00:00,559,Just got home from work a half hour ago .. the 403 from Brantford to Hamilton is a mess .. QEW wasnt much better .. the plows are stopped at Walkers ... one of em decided to plow the ditch on the onramp
283496,solopaddler,2008-12-24 09:21:00,8605,"I'm currently working at the weather station at Mount Hope. No rain yet, just non stop snow all night long. The temp is rising above 0 now though... Should make for some nice wet, heavy snow to shovel  .  I've got roughly 18cm measured on the ground here, and some of the drifts are well over 2 feet. That's a far cry from the 6-8cm that was predicted! (But then as you know it's not an exact science.  )"
283498,outllaw,2008-12-24 10:41:00,1232,slop in windsor. thanks for the heads up eh. im sure the ice will be dicey going till this mess re-frezes.
283500,Rich Clemens,2008-12-24 11:04:00,3131,"You folks aren't alone, with the ice anyway.   Woke about a wee bit ago to a covering of ice over everything.   Seems to be switching over to rain and to continue warming up a bit today into the 40's.  May be a fun ride to work, but I'll bet the crews are already out.  Be safe everyone and allow extra time."
283509,Big Cliff,2008-12-24 12:04:00,6899,"Lindsay 7:00 am, the snow has stopped, temp 0Â° C Rain should be starting in the next little while, I am a little worried that with all the snow on the roofs if we get all the rain they are predicting there could be some serious problems. There has to be close to 2' of snow on our neighbours cottage, if that gets saturated it is going to be a lot of weight.  We were going to drive up to Sudbury to spend Christmas with our kids but I just checked the weather and road reports, not going anywhere today! Tomorrow looks a little better but more nasty stuff coming again on Friday. Going to talk it over with Sue when she gets up. Might just stay home for Christmas this year."
283523,SlowPoke,2008-12-24 13:35:00,2984,"Mike, I should have called you when I was passing through around 1AM. Chatham to Windsor wasn't bad... London to Toronto to Chatham sucked harder than a ""Binford Fan Cooled Universal Bypass Central Vacuuming System""  "
