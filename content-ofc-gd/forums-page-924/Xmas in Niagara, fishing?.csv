Instead spendin time infront of a slot machine, I plan to practice casting and maybe land a few fish.  Is the season closed for Niagra shore fishing? Queeston launch.  Any1 willing to share other spots? PM (I know this is almost a rhetorical question, but I'll try my luck anyway  ) - except for Whirlpool, I think every1 knows that spot. I would be a true survivor if I make it down there this time of the year!  Merry Christmas, Happy Hanaka & Happy New Year!"
