283095,Jeff_C,2008-12-23 03:50:00,50,"Ryan and I put the snowshoes on and ventured out this morning.  We went about 800 yards out and it was a tough go.  Ice thickness ranged from 7"" to 3"" of hard black ice.  Today wasn't for the faint of heart, but it was well worth it.  Here is a pic of one of Ryan's fish.  Jeff  "
