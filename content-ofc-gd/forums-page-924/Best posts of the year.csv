282275,Terry,2008-12-21 12:34:00,14456,"there are great people on this board and the quality of their writing and photography blows my mind, many took courses in journalism and have lots of schooling while others publish their stories.... but no less important are the guys/gals who write a simple report and or simple pic of the fish they did or didn't catch  so, as much as there are some members threads I love to read, I don't like the ""lets make it a contest"" to see who is the best of the best  I really didn't like it when we were picking the best member of the year.........  but you guys have have nominated some great posters for sure  I just want to keep reading the posts    I love them all  well except that one guy and I won't say his name....LOL"
282295,bucktail,2008-12-21 14:36:00,1857,"Moosebunks was the best for me I think, simply awesome in every way, writing, photography!  But the one post I wait for every year is DanC's late August trip to Nipigon every year! Maybe someday I will just bully my way into that amazing trip!!!!"
282318,Cookslav,2008-12-21 15:27:00,1457,"I couldn't pick just one... Way to many great posts/trip logs/Short stories to pick just one.  Thats what I love about this site, Its always got a hand full of great posts going."
282330,LeXXington,2008-12-21 15:56:00,1928,Everyone who puts fishing reports with pictures and stories.. Some people get too fish where we only dream of going..
282372,ehg,2008-12-21 17:10:00,2666,"There is so many great fishing reports posted it's hard to cover them all. Leechman posted links above to some of the best.  Also SNAG had a couple good ones recently like (Fishin...with Death) fun stuff.  TBayBoy posted great photos and writeups, JohnnyBass had non stop great reports in the warm weather, Enjoyed Lake O reports from iceguy and troutguy in the summer. Lots of folks posted whatever there fishing trips provided and their efforts were appreciated. CCMT, jwl, mistyriver1, trapshooter, fishnsled, limeyangler, silvio, CC, Kemper, Mke the Pike etc...... The reports from Lakair and Quinte G2G's were standouts as well. Great site with lots of great fishing and (NF) posts"
282378,Dutch,2008-12-21 17:27:00,831,Moosebunk is the best poster on this board - bar none.  Sorry to offend anyone else.....  My nomination for the best post this year though is ccmt's OFC Anthem - GREAT STUFF!!!!
282811,danbo,2008-12-22 15:09:00,2646,"How about the guy with the ""Record"" White Crappie?  That was fun!"
283234,iceslayer,2008-12-23 16:13:00,97,"Is there anyway you could direct me to that post Danbo??  Be nice to see that..  Thanks,   Jim"
283301,highdrifter,2008-12-23 20:04:00,2534,Snag for Mayor.  Moosebunk for Secretary of State.  Solopaddler for Governor General.  nough said.  HD
282236,limeyangler,2008-12-21 05:32:00,5204,"This is really tough, so many different reasons why different posts and posters would qualify if ya know what i mean .   I totally agree, Moosebunk's post are legendary, Solopaddler should be banned from fishing for steelhead so there are some left for the rest of us  , Leechman is definitely best newcomer...was noticing his post count...considering only a few months you certainly got stuck into the forum Jaques.....yer posts are darn good too   CCMT.......nuff said.  JOEY....excellent captain of the 'MAN HO'S'  RICH has got to be in there ....loved the winter carping posts especially  Clampit for his...er...sense of humour?.....lol   Johnnyb for proposing whilst fishing....then forgetting to take his fishing rods on honeymoon  The list goes on and on.    I am flattered to get a mention, however, there are so many people who contribute way more than me and i sincerely feel everyone who posts on here should get credit for making this site what it is. AND THAT AINT LIP SERVICE!!!!!!!!!    Merry Xmas all   LIMEY."
282250,snag,2008-12-21 06:29:00,1932,"I'm not worthy nominators,   LUNDBOY  HOLDFAST  LUNDBOY  HOLDFAST  LUNDBOY  HOLDFAST "
282269,Spiel,2008-12-21 12:15:00,9065, ....I'd say this post best reflects my thoughts on this. Nicely put JWL.
281810,forrest,2008-12-20 01:28:00,1032,"After the fist dozen posts it became clear that the simple below categories were not the best way to do a vote that includes a wide range of great posts and posters.  The board owners will want an option to give guidance (it is their baby).  so post away great threads and the ideas.  There will be a later thread to setup a final poll:  . . . . .  ORIGINAL POST: old post taste funny, but I don't remember seeing that big bass before, it was a good set of pics. That old post being bumped gave me an idea.  How about Nominations for best fish post? Post or PM me with your favorites and I will narrow down a voting list.  Maybe someone will put up some OFC stuff for winners?    (or take this over)  Categories: Best single fish Best fishing day where the catching was not so hot Best fishing day where it was the best due to the fish caught Best overall poster  forrest  PS...was this done last year too, therefore, making this a lame copycat?"
281811,Bernie,2008-12-20 01:32:00,3190,I like the idea Forrest. Several could be nominated and then polled for the winner.
281816,kemper,2008-12-20 01:43:00,2232,1. solopaddler 2. solopaddler 3. solopaddler     nuff said
281817,drwxr,2008-12-20 01:45:00,453,steelheading- solopaddler hands down (he's the only guy that is exempt from annual report ) variety fish - moosebunk both members write fun to read reports and include lots of pictures. good to have them around.
281818,misfish,2008-12-20 01:48:00,29133,"  Yes I would go with that Kemp,but there are many others aswell. The MOOSE comes to mind.Justin aswell.  Those two get my vote Forest."
281819,forrest,2008-12-20 01:48:00,1032,Please post an individual links if you can.  I can think of a few kick butt posters Solopaddler and Moosebunk included.....and that CCMT guy keeps posting big fish.   One more category.....best overall poster.....sounds like solopaddler is nominated a few times.   forrest
281820,misfish,2008-12-20 01:49:00,29133,Oh and dont forget leechman.
281821,kemper,2008-12-20 01:51:00,2232,"Moose as well.  We shall give the title to both of them, its a tie."
281825,Bernie,2008-12-20 01:59:00,3190,Maybe we need an amateur category?  Solopaddler and Moosebunk are both top contenders but I recall a few other good ones too.
281827,misfish,2008-12-20 02:00:00,29133, Im out.LOL  Good idea Forest
281829,BassAsin,2008-12-20 02:03:00,806,sounds like a good idea! maybe people under 500 posts or only been here a few months?
281838,Leecher,2008-12-20 02:12:00,7832, Thanks Brian I'm honoured
281839,forrest,2008-12-20 02:13:00,1032,"Is this how the first academy awards went?  new category idea Amateur poster / new poster --> should it go by date joining or number of posts?  If posts how many posts?  Regards,  forrest"
281841,ccmtcanada,2008-12-20 02:16:00,7971,"Solopaddler, Moosebunk...both amazing storytellers with awesome pictures...  SNAG for pure hilarity!!!"
281842,BassAsin,2008-12-20 02:19:00,806,"i guess if we're goin for best post how about we go by # of posts?  300 400? how many defines an ""amateur"" is the question i guess, if i wanna have a chance i better stop posting suggestions eh? lol"
281844,forrest,2008-12-20 02:27:00,1032,"I knew both solopaddler, leechman, moosebunk and a few others made many great posts and I went to make a list....wow.....If those few were the Pittsburgh Steelers the rest of use would be the Timhorton Tykes  forrest"
281845,Leecher,2008-12-20 02:33:00,7832, How about making a top 20 list? with the above criteria?
281846,Zubris21,2008-12-20 02:36:00,563,"Limeyangler has contributed great reports on a regular basis.  During the summer months Mikethebassfisherman posted quite a few reports and seems to be the most dedicated new member as far as I can tell, even though I haven't been around long myself."
281848,forrest,2008-12-20 02:41:00,1032," Yes, there are a lot of great posts from many people.  Solopaddler, Moosebunk and Leechman are certainly dominant quality posters.  There are others though like those bass pics (best amateur) and a wack of others....a thread of best threads (top 20) would be a good read.  This needs some collective thought....or maybe people can just start posting links to what they though was the best thread of the year, no commenting just ""post/thread of the year"" too keep it simple.  free for alls often work.  Let the threads and suggestions fly....lets try to make it so amateurs and best pic posts ect have their say.  forrest"
281858,steverowbotham,2008-12-20 03:23:00,1800,Solo and Moosebunk definitely come to mind ... next to me of course
281862,BassAsin,2008-12-20 03:30:00,806,i havnt been here long either but i have noticed mikethebassfisherman quite a bit with some nice pictures!
281869,Bernie,2008-12-20 03:41:00,3190," A ""tooting your own horn category"" ?"
281874,shane,2008-12-20 03:58:00,652,I think there should be a separate category for NF posts.
281875,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-20 03:59:00,10439,And North of 60 Posts.
281881,pike slayer,2008-12-20 04:11:00,1177,ok i'll make it my goal for 09 to post many reports and pictures and make it to the top ten!
