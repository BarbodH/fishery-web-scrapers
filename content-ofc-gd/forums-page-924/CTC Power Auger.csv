283078,Mike the Pike,2008-12-23 03:05:00,3421,Funny you post that I was looking at the same one this evening at CTC I also wondered if they are good machines.  There was a 10 inch 3hp jiffy also for $299.So tempting.  I wanted to lift it up to see how heavy it was but they had it tie wrapped to the shelf  When I do buy one it will be a model lighter than the Jiffy.  MTP

283091,Brian,2008-12-23 03:36:00,33,Looks like a nice unit.  Does anyone have any idea how many hp that would be?  Likely only 2 hp I'm guessin
283096,ciceri,2008-12-23 03:50:00,535,"i dont know, but it is high performance"
283099,richyb,2008-12-23 03:56:00,774,The low end jiffy 2hp has 49cc    http://www.bobbershopfishing.com/ice_auger...elightning.html

283106,Fang,2008-12-23 04:12:00,1330,All I can ever remember using up in Temagami was that 2HP Jiffy and we regularly were cutting 3+ft of ice and many holes per day. I just remember it being a bit heavy to lug around.  I figure if I can do 12-24 with this lighter one it should do most of where I fish. All I need is someone to pul it in their sleigh.

283177,mbac31,2008-12-23 13:00:00,904,"I have the jiffy auger. I beleive mine is 85cc and about 37-38 lbs. They do get heavy to carry sometimes. For most people a 2 hp one is good enough. That looks like a decent auger @ a decent price. Buy it, if its no good return it."
283203,porkpie,2008-12-23 14:51:00,2521,"That is an eskimo auger, made by ardisam, relabled for CT.  I had one of the originals, and it was a junk to keep running, and I returned it.  They have had several years to get the design right, and most eskimo products are quality, so I imagine they've probably sorted out the bugs.  I'd try it again fwiw."
