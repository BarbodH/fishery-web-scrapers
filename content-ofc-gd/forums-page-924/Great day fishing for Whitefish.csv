282749,wuchikubo,2008-12-22 11:21:00,1114,Fantastic job out there. Fish posted in #8 looks like a cisco/herring.  Too bad on the sled.  Look forward to seeing some more ice fishing posts.

282913,solopaddler,2008-12-22 19:48:00,8605,"Well done! I'm a huge fan of whitefish through the ice, thanks for the report bud."

282306,douG,2008-12-21 14:56:00,2693,That was some fine whitefish action there.  Nice shootin.  Hope the sled repair doesn't pinch too much.
282307,Terry,2008-12-21 14:57:00,14456,"great report too bad about the sled  I have to wait till the new year to do whitefish fishing, can't wait"

282325,Leecher,2008-12-21 15:46:00,7832,"Great report, pics and videos Simon  WOW.... you guys sure put a beating on those whities and got into some good quality ones, congratulations I guess you don't have any regrets buying the new shelter.... looks real comfy  It's too bad that Glen lost that jack at the hole.... from video and the way he was fighting it, looked like it was a big one  I got to say Simon, you're not the luckiest when it comes to sleds     Hope it's just a minor repair Thanks for taking the time to put this report together and sharing it with us Leechman  ps What was the ice thickness?"
282327,ozaibak1,2008-12-21 15:52:00,401,"Great report, that was a lot of fun to read and watch! Makes me even more excited about trying out ice fishing in Jan."
282337,profisher25,2008-12-21 16:23:00,185,"This may seem stupid of me, but i dunno, like,, in one of your pictures, there is a heater, and its reasonable to keep one with you, because it must get freezing at times, but does that not begin to melt the ice within the hut? PM me if you can, that would be great......  P.s. .. i am sorry if this post is considered an ""old"" post.. but i don't think it is so yea, don't freak out at me"
282347,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-21 16:32:00,2038,"Awesome report Simon....   Obviously you guys had a blast out there ,, Jacques and a couple of us will be heading out for some Whities soon"
282352,irishfield,2008-12-21 16:36:00,26272,Great report !!!! Too bad about the sled... always the way when borrowed. How thick was the ice??
282353,tbayboy,2008-12-21 16:39:00,1497,"Great day Simon, other than than the snow machine that is  Very tasty looking pile of fish for sure."
282354,limeyangler,2008-12-21 16:41:00,5204,"in reply to Leechman and irishfield, guys...the ice was around 10"" thick....some snow....but really black ice all the way through."
282358,irishfield,2008-12-21 16:45:00,26272,"Thanks... just wanted to know what will really hold a full size truck. Gotta go North in the morning for a funeral and wanna check our camp as well. I know there's 12"" in our bay...but may still walk out!"
282360,pike slayer,2008-12-21 16:47:00,1177,"great report! and im impressed that your out on the ice with your truck already before new years! gonna be a good year, might have to get an extension for my auger this year lol. thanks for sharing"

282443,Grimace,2008-12-21 19:58:00,2020,Nice whities.  You live in Heaven
282488,Greencoachdog,2008-12-21 21:53:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics Simon!!!  Don't you know not to spank the monkey when there are other folks around to hear the sound of ""one hand clapping""?"
282604,Sinker,2008-12-22 00:43:00,8692,"I'm so jealous!!!!! The vids are great in the reports, I really like that, but I have to ask......how do you take the vid, and bring in the fish at the same time??? Pretty slick dude!!!  I'm hoping to get out for some whities over the christmas holidays too!! Also one of my favourites thru the ice......gotta love em!!! Have you ever tried a slip float for them?? It works amazing.....so sensitive!!  Sinker"
282608,BassAsin,2008-12-22 00:49:00,806,love the report! great photos and great pics! -16 here today i felt like wearing shorts LOL warmest we've had in a while too!  love the videos as well adds a lot to the report. Matt!
282614,nancur373,2008-12-22 01:09:00,1211,Nice report. Some great camera work there while landing the fish. Only this I didn't like about it was the towing of the sled by the one ski. You should always put a small piece of tree or a stick through both ski handles and tie the rope to the center.  Curt
282618,limeyangler,2008-12-22 01:15:00,5204,   You know what....i'm gonna try that now!....ive heard of it before....but never tried as its always too cold here...the water in and around the hole freezes in miliseconds....but with the heated shack!...thanks for that sinker...as many know....I LOVE SLIP BOBBERS!        Do i get a section 8 for that?
282625,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 01:29:00,8163," Well... if there's nobody around but other guys.. I think it qualifies under the ""don't ask, don't tell rule"""
