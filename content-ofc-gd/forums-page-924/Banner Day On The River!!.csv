282697,eyeforelle,2008-12-22 03:06:00,38,"wow, those U.S. fish sure look dark...can someone say ROE WAGONS?"
282791,blaque,2008-12-22 13:53:00,2419,"I can say it, i just dont know what it means?"
283087,eyeforelle,2008-12-23 03:26:00,38,roe wagon=big plump  female trout or salmon  .
283216,highdrifter,2008-12-23 15:35:00,2534,"I'm eating crud pie right now...  The action shots at the mouth of the river are totally sweet!  Like you said, it's all about timing..  And going where the fish are!!  cheers HD"
281578,solopaddler,2008-12-19 16:07:00,8605,"I decided at virtually the last minute to fish on Thursday and happily BillM on the board was keen to acompany me. Bill was another guy who had expressed an interest in fishing with me in the past and yesterday was finally the day we hooked up. Everyone I've met through this board has been a first class individual and Bill was no exception. Trust me, if any of you guys ever have the opportunity to fish with Bill, do it. He's a great guy!  Now, onto the good stuff  . As per my previous post it's very hard to predict where and when to go this time of year, especially when there's looong drives involved to get where you're going. Many times it's very much a gamble. Last Sunday I figured it would be good, but it wasn't. It seemed as though Thursday would provide prime conditions, but who knows for sure?  All I did know for sure was the temps would be bearable, the winds would be low (that's key), and the water level and colour would be prime. That was good enough for me. Would there be fish? Well, we found out rather quickly. After suiting up Bill caught his first fish on his very first drift just steps from the truck.        He was giggling like a schoolgirl!  It was pretty much game on right from the onset. We caught amazing numbers of fish for this late in December:                       This particular fish was missing an eye yet still seemed healthy and fat. Nature's amazing eh?                                   Notice what's sitting on the ground beside this fish?     Many of the fish in this particular river are fall spawners and it's always a bonus when you can get some of this:                     This was the biggest of the day, very fat and thick across the back. Here's a couple different views:         Finished up right at the lake and Bill capped his day off with a couple of freshies:               What an AMAZING day!  Thanks again for the company Bill, 'till next time!   Cheers,  Mike"
281580,irishfield,2008-12-19 16:13:00,26272,Great stuff guys!!! And Mike... I've had Bill in the boat...and yes.. he's tolerable! lol
281582,troutologist,2008-12-19 16:17:00,951,Heck of a day guys! I miss steelhead already we've been in the freezer here nearly a month...cait wait til the 1st.  Keep up the good work and keep posting open water pics.
281583,blaque,2008-12-19 16:17:00,2419,Banner indeed........looks like alot of froggish water yur fishing there Solo? Im never very confident in that stuff..........how do you fish those areas with such success. Especially out by the mouths.........wouldnt your presentation just be sitting still and bobbing in the ripples? Something with some stink and milking capabilities in your presentation do the trick usually?
281587,Leecher,2008-12-19 16:21:00,7832,Great report and pics Mike  WOW you guys really hit'em hard this time.... Congratulations to both of you Beautiful colors on them and that one eye steel sure looked healthy even with her handicap  Again congratulations to both of you and thanks for sharing that wonderful day Leechman
281589,anders,2008-12-19 16:22:00,1168,Great looking pics guys!  Like troutoligist said we are in the freezer here and cold.  Good to see people still fishing open water!
281597,FLEX ROD,2008-12-19 16:38:00,394,This is a love have relationship! I love your post solo and I hate you for the fact that you have the time to go and fish like you do   this has just been brutal for me 4 months of not holding a fishing rod due to a loosy knee surgery!  Great report like always keep up the great work.  FLEX - John
281605,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-19 16:51:00,10439,HMMMMMM.................... I wonder where they were on Sunday? May have moved back into the lake during the cold front. I miss that spot.
281608,johnnyb,2008-12-19 16:55:00,3413,"Wow -- I don't know how you do it...gave up on river fishing a few years ago, but your reports really make me want to try again...good job!"
281609,jwl,2008-12-19 16:55:00,1056,"that's a wicked day of fishin..pre frontal troutin at it's finest right there.  Thanks for the big tease man, I was supposed to get out in my boat today but there is all this funny white stuff everywhere  You guys where all over those fish like a smart kid on a fatty"
281610,silvio,2008-12-19 16:56:00,433,"Wtg boys nice pics, looks like you boys had yourselves an amazing day."
281612,muskeybugged,2008-12-19 16:57:00,282,"Awwww..... I'm done.... goodnight!  All them pictures when did you have the time to fish?  Great post, great day!"
281617,solopaddler,2008-12-19 17:07:00,8605," Estuary water close to the lake is always a good bet, but especially so at this time of year. The fish tend to stack up in water like that, both fresh and holdover fish.  There's always some flow so your float does move, albeit slowly. And yes, my bait of choice is fresh skein tied in mesh. Gooey, soft and lots of scent oozing out of it for fish to key on."
281619,silvio,2008-12-19 17:13:00,433,Mike is that the new ang specs
281622,solopaddler,2008-12-19 17:18:00,8605," Indeed. Fabulous reel, BUT it has a tendency to freeze up. Don't think I'll be using it in sub zero temps anymore.."
281623,jdmls,2008-12-19 17:23:00,575,"The dispenser , I LUV the dispenser !!!!   :clapping:   Awesome day guy's. Well worth the trek !!! Especially for you Bill, as that one is quite a ways from your neck of the woods... That spot is perfect indeed !!!  Beauty pics...Bill did you order a new combo for the spring yet? Looks like the wet noodle took a beating , LOL !!!"
281636,BillM,2008-12-19 17:45:00,17367,"Mike, I'm still giggling like a schoolgirl   What a day!!  I have never experienced a day like that, and from I'm told that's an 'average' day for that place.  It was a long day (out of the house by 2am, back home at around 9:30pm) but worth it.  I couldn't have asked for better company, the pleasure was all mine.  I'm sure we'll have a few more days like this (bring on the spring!).  I am sore all over today, I think it might be time to upgrade to a rod with a little more backbone, those fish beat me up pretty good.  I still haven't got the stink out of my vest from those monster, nasty things you were using as bait  :)"
