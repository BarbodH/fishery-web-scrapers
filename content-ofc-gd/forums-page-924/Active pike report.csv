283434,limeyangler,2008-12-24 02:04:00,5204,"Great report, great pike....superb bass!!!   wow, the perch in our area would rarely hit a jig that large in my experience.   Good job guys, looks like a good day out."

Alot more action than Leechman and I had , we tried the night bite for a change , things didn't work out in our favour ,,   Here is a pic of Leechman trying out his new toy    The rest of the time we were out looked like this    Things were at a stand still     Oh well, it was still nice to be out on the Ice"
283456,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-24 03:15:00,709,hey whitespinnerbait  i offered you my fishing holes and you didnt take them .....
283468,Leecher,2008-12-24 03:47:00,7832," Hey Simon, remember you asked about tips for bass in some of your local lakes, well here is the weapon of choice for them while jigging, Canadian Wobbler in bronze.... Tip it with the head of a small minnow       Yeah Paul.... It happens to the best of us     Will have better results next time..... Here is a closer look at my new toy with some artillery.... my chrismas gift...  from me to me    and some of the additional items that I have now      Jacques aka Leechman"
283478,waterwolf,2008-12-24 04:45:00,556,"great day on the river !! congarts on some good lookin' pike ,,and that bucket's  definitely a nice pick-up in the bonus round ."
283537,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-24 14:44:00,709,  yeah i find that bass are verry fun on the ice they wont take the long runs like a pike but they sure have the weight to them!  you know its a bass on your tip up when it takes 20 - 30 seconds for you tip up to go down....  they just slowly take the minnow and swim away. slow mo!  can you imagine hitting a nickel on the ice!  thanx for the replies and happy xmas and a great new year! to yAll
283614,Leecher,2008-12-24 18:36:00,7832, The very best to you and yours for the holiday season.
283637,Badger Shark,2008-12-24 20:52:00,291,"Good to see you guys back out there, at least now there will be constasnt reports until Spring to keep me busy.  I hate winter!  I am not surprised you got yourself a largie, afterall you caught a tonne during the year.  Keep it up and looking forward to the next 3amigos report."
