283698,Bernie,2008-12-25 02:03:00,3190," Wow, Wayne you sure wouldn't think so the last three days. Everybody was in a panic. I asked a few of them ""how long has it been doing that?"" Sheepishly  they would reply ""for a few days but I was hoping it would go away"" Anyway we worked late yesterday to get them going. I didn't book anything else today."
