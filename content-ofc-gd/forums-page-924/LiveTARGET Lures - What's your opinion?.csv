280753,singingdog,2008-12-17 11:38:00,1047," There you go....there is probably no better reason to buy them than this. If you believe it's going to catch fish, your going to fish it hard."
281073,Markystang,2008-12-18 05:13:00,131,"To the original poster: Here's my limited experience. I have 2 of the Perch pattern, a large one and a small one, both in the shiny finish. The large one pulls to the side quite hard and definitely appears to need some tuning. The smaller one has actually caught me a 3lb Laker while trolling this summer, on a day when no one else in the boat caught anything. I've only used it one or two times other than that though, with out success, although nothing else worked those days either... I should mention that I attached the lures to my line with a snap-swivel, which the instructions say not to do. Perhaps this has something to do with the large one not running straight? The small one runs perfectly on the exact same setup though... I'm not really into tying lures directly on, it makes it a nuisance to change lures. I do plan on using them both more next season though, and I'll definitely tune the large one before I try it again.  To some of you other guys: Get a life. The guy asked a simple question. CLEARLY not spamming. Some people don't want to have to sift through a bunch of crap to get to the actual answers to the original question. Personally, I don't give a rats a$$ if you think his post is spam, or if you think this entire thread is an advertisement. This thread is 3 pages long, and over half of it is total crap. Nothing to do with the original question. Not even entertaining... Again, I intend no offense to anyone. It's just a pet peeve of mine that I see quite often while browsing this site. I think you guys are probably scaring off a lot of first time posters who want to ask valid questions but fear the consequences."
281109,Terry,2008-12-18 13:22:00,14456,"this is a discussion forum...you have to expect people to give their opinions, the good the bad and the ugly  almost every time a  first time poster posts a thread like this it is spam.................  so if their opinion  is it's spam, expect that to be what they write, just like your little rant on guys ranting about  spammers.....  it's all good"

283209,fishinggeek,2008-12-23 15:08:00,325,"That's a lot of dough to dish out on a suspect lure.  I don't think finishes are all that, and certainly wouldn't pay such a high premium (IMO) on these lures.  This thread is what it is, but I suspect there's quite a bit of spam in it.  All the more reason not to buy them, for me at least."
283221,profisher25,2008-12-23 15:44:00,185,RAPALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  lol that is all
279826,BigSmallie,2008-12-15 13:05:00,61,"As far as price goes I believe you get what you pay for most of the time in any type of fishing gear(rods, reels, line, hooks, lures). Yes you can catch fish on lures you get at the dollar store but after spending a lot of time on the water and dollars in the stores I've switched to more quality baits as they do catch more fish and tend to stand up longer to the abuse.   Steve, there is a 4 3/4 inch perch crank coming for the larger game fish.   For those interested here is a sneak peak at the additions for 2009. Smelt jerkbait and deepdiver(silver & gold), Crawfish rattle trap (i've never seen anything like this one on the market), smallmouth bass crank(detail is amazing) and a larger crawfish crank.  Singingdog, the life like fins and body details create additional flash points where as a lot of baits are smooth bodies with painted details which don't give off any additional flash."

279982,fishermccann,2008-12-15 22:08:00,655,"This has been nothing but one BIG ad, because of this I don't think that I will be buying any!"
279984,Rich,2008-12-15 22:13:00,3927,Indeed. I won't even look at the website to see what these lures look like now.
279991,Roy,2008-12-15 22:26:00,13728,"Another marketing lesson learned, I suppose. Seriously though, I'm not saying how good or not so good this bait is because I have no idea. I also don't know whether this thread was designed to sell baits. I DO know however that if someone wants to present a product, service or idea on this site, they really should talk to site admin first.  For the time being though, I think we should give this dude the benefit of the doubt. Either try the bait or don't talk about it."
280003,BigSmallie,2008-12-15 22:44:00,61,I chatted with Grant at Koppers and he does not know who the original poster is(his pic and e-mail address are in his profile) so you should give the poster the benefit of the doubt. He's been signed up since June before making his first post and he is also contributing on other threads. You guys are quick to judge.

280088,Greencoachdog,2008-12-16 01:50:00,8163,"  This was the question asked:    You know as well as I do that when you ask for input it's not always going to be positive input, and that's not always a bad thing either.  The information in this thread could save someone from wasting money on a lure may never use because they were under the impression that it was a top quality lure that ran true out of the box and not one that that would have to ""tune"" with an instruction sheet. There are some people that don't want to waste time futzing around on the water tuning a bait that they paid a hefty price for, and there are others that couldn't tune one if they wanted to with or without an instruction sheet!!!  If this thread was started to sell these lures.. it may have done the Wile E. Coyote backfire instead!  Be careful what you ask for... you may get it!   btw.. does anyone know the country of origin for these lures?"
280296,rbaquial,2008-12-16 18:05:00,968,"My intent wasn't to promote the product, It was, as some of you had said - just to know what POSITIVE/NEGATIVE experience some anglers have had with this lure. I think despite what some few negatives I've heard about this lure, I'm still going to head out and pickup a few of my own. I've always believed (when it came to fishing lures) that the angler him/herself must have faith in the lure.  Thanks for your input guys - I'm REALLY GLAD/HAPPY that I've decided to become more active on this site!  Much Appreciated!"
280551,Greencoachdog,2008-12-17 00:54:00,8163," Be sure to let us know how you like them (good or bad), and if they catch fish for you!"
280557,highdrifter,2008-12-17 01:03:00,2534, BAAHHAH!!  Ever tried the real skin from Lucky Craft??
279597,fishindevil,2008-12-14 21:15:00,6254,"Well i say congrats to grant for all his hard work in developing& producing his very own lures !!!!   I think they look amazing,and i have caught a few walleyes on the deep diver medium shinny metalic perch....i wish i had them down at the bay of quinte this fall,i would have run a few for sure !!  and those shad rap type,baits look awesome,and i will be running them more next year,i dont think people realize all the time & effort that go into a venture like that,and acually succeding,so i give him credit for sure,and i hope that there are more to come too,as of yet i have had no problems with any of his lures...cheers"
279599,Mark Kulik,2008-12-14 21:18:00,348,"Ive heard good thing about the Koppers baits, from the accounts that I've heard they work well, I will try them out in 09 for sure!"
279603,pike slayer,2008-12-14 21:26:00,1177,well thats good to know that they have different finishes. when i seen them it looked like a lure that would do well and did not. the only thing keeping me from buying more and giving them a better chance is the price. if they were $7-9 i'd buy a few different ones and work them hard. i'd be intersted in the jerk bait. i'm a firm believer in the xraps and i'd rate it has the best lure out there currently. after using them it has totally changed my fishing. i now have well over 50 xraps in my tackle trunk all different colours and sizes. although the new ones with the sureset hook stink! that large hook just bends to crap after catching a 5lb+ fish. when you put the jerk bait out on thr market show it on here and i'll pick a few up and run them hard
279606,fishindevil,2008-12-14 21:30:00,6254,"Yes pike slayer there are 2 kinds,one is metalic shinny,and one is the dull matt finish,i prefer the metalic,man it sure puts out a flash,and about the x-raps,yes they are awesome for everything from bassto salmon on lake ontario,no argument there,have you seen his crayfish lures & the shad stule baits as well,they look almost real !!!!"

279614,pike slayer,2008-12-14 21:44:00,1177,thanks alot. where i bought them they had like zero selection. only ones i seen were the flat! i'll look into them but probably wont buy till spring. ice fishing is where its at right now!
279641,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-14 22:43:00,4399,Just what we need another must have lure to lie beside all the other must have lures in my box.
