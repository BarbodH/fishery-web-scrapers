283186,solopaddler,2008-12-23 14:00:00,8605,"That's crazy but oddly familiar. Back when I lived and worked in Manila, each morning on the way to work there'd be 2-3 guys with high powered rifles trained onto the surface of this disgustingly muddy river. Apparantly every once in a while a fish would surface (usually catfish) and they'd blast 'em  . Others waiting on the rivers edge would scoop them up with nets.

283198,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-23 14:35:00,2050, Never mind the launcher - I imagine a missile refill costs a few more bucks than a Rapala!  Next time I lose one to a snag I won't feel so bad!
283207,kentooley,2008-12-23 15:04:00,208,I think it depends on what size Rapala. What's he using...J?
