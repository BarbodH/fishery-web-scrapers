283349,xeon,2008-12-23 22:30:00,350,"OMNR is your best bet, but I guess there probably closed for the holidays. Just give them a call, or show up, I think there right at the end of Church St. right near the waterfront."
283360,jwl,2008-12-23 23:08:00,1056," can't remember the street name but it's right beside the dam by the locks, cross over the dam and it's right there on the right"
283400,camillj,2008-12-24 00:58:00,1988,Call the MNR they are REALLY helpful .. and will mail them to you (snailmail)...
283401,irishfield,2008-12-24 01:02:00,26272,I had the stocking webpage bookmarked... but they revamped their website again.. so it doesn't work. If you search long enough.. you'll find it.
283409,sturgman,2008-12-24 01:32:00,249,  Ditto!! I have called my local M.N.R office to request hydro maps of local lakes that were surveyed as far back as th e early 70's. If the maps are available they will mail you (snail mail)
283447,pike slayer,2008-12-24 02:33:00,1177,"alrite thanks guys! i was hoping someone could just send me a link real quick and have it instantly other then calling and waiting and waiting, who knows what they are working during the holidays to go pick them up."
283448,sturgman,2008-12-24 02:39:00,249,"Mom always told me that ""patience was a virtue""  and  ""all good things come to those who wait""....."
283450,irishfield,2008-12-24 02:47:00,26272, Well sorry there Pike Slayer.. but I tried ! Like I said... get on the MNR site and start searching. It's there... my old book marked link doesn't work anymore!  They'll be a work tomorrow.. for the morning at least.
283457,kingjames_2nd,2008-12-24 03:16:00,72,I phoned the soo MNR a  few weeks ago and they emailed me the master list.  PM me your email and I'll forward it over to you if you like.
283460,ctdd2006,2008-12-24 03:27:00,531,I actually picked up a hard copy today.  Any lake in particular you're looking for?
283655,pike slayer,2008-12-24 22:00:00,1177,no lake in particular. i wanted it to find out where they have been stocking and try a couple of the different ones i've never been to before.
