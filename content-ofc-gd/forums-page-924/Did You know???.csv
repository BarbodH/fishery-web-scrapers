283554,Burtess,2008-12-24 15:35:00,901,"No offence to Crabbs but his member number is #4295...... rhcranked is #4000....  rhcranked Newbie Group: Members Posts: 3 Joined: 25-September 08 Member No.: 4,000   Burt"
283556,Greencoachdog,2008-12-24 15:42:00,8163,  I noticed that too Burt!!!   ... maybe someone is padding the members list?
283558,Roy,2008-12-24 15:47:00,13728," I understand your concern but this is how it works. When you register, you are assigned the next number on the list. If someone was to register under another name to have two accounts, one of the accounts would be dropped by administration.....so, the account numbers would continue to increase but the number of members would actually decrease. (as an example) That's why the account number is always greater than the actual number of members.  edit: We also do housecleaning from time to time to remove inactive accounts."
283565,Greencoachdog,2008-12-24 16:19:00,8163,I just hope poor ol' rhcranked doesn't find out about this!... to learn that he's been living a lie for these past 3 1/2 months.. might be devastating!!!
