282898,Marty,2008-12-22 19:16:00,873,My son has the Rapala one.   He loves it.  Can fish anywhere and he's caught 10 muskies in one day.
282915,Governator,2008-12-22 19:53:00,879,"There is rapala tournament fishing and rapala fishing frenzy for wii.  Don't let the artwork on the fishing frenzy box fool you, I own the game and it's much better than the tournament fishing one.  Fishing Frenzy Review Tournament Fishing Review  The controls take some time to get use to, casting isn't quite as simple as just toss it out there as it took me about an hour to get the real hang of it.  I'd recommend it but only for someone who really really wants a fishing game."
282926,Leecher,2008-12-22 20:30:00,7832,"I have the Sega Bass Fishing and really like it and loads of fun.... not a great review from the link below but still fun to play in tournament mode, single player:  Review Here"
282963,Mattones,2008-12-22 22:32:00,587,I own rapala fishing frenzy for PS3. I agree with Governater the controls take some time. I'm still not sure if I fully understand it haha. I quit playing when i got Caleba's Hunting.
282967,highdrifter,2008-12-22 22:39:00,2534,"Any idea on how to turn off that blasted tutorial??!!  You get species specific missions, say: Earn 10 000 points in 20 min while only catching Largemouth Bass...  I'm getting tired of hearing Failed, Better luck next time, when I don't set the hook on unwanted species..  It's an okay game, but it's too close to the Sega Bass game, IMO.  They've also skimped out on lake choices, lure selection and the underwater interaction.  Apparently, there's other fishing games besides Frenzy and Tournament Fishing..  Anyone ever played em?!  HD"
282972,Mattones,2008-12-22 22:58:00,587,I have seen 3-4 fishing game at EB Games in Burlington on Dunda's and Appleby. Not sure of the names though sorry.
282980,Guest lundboy,2008-12-22 23:08:00,0,"Yes there's ""Hooked"".  Not quite as good as the others.  But interesting just the same."
283052,BigSmallie,2008-12-23 02:02:00,61,Thanks for the feedback. Sounds like I might wait for the next generation of fishing games from those reviews. I'll have to see if Mario Cart has one that looks like a boat.......
283062,Handlebarz,2008-12-23 02:28:00,3790,from what Mrs.Caluse sais I think there will be a Frenzy at my house on Xmas day Woo Hoo along with some car crushing street racing and what the other stuff was I dont know. I hope this Wii thing is as good as they say.
283067,Bondar,2008-12-23 02:36:00,817,"the sega bass fishing is on sale at Bass pro for 49.99 comes with the hardware to make your controller into a fishing rod looking kinda deal, its on the front page of the flyer i got oh and the sale is only on boxing day which means they probably have about 5 of them to sucker you into the store i'd rather pay actual price and avoid the boxing day terror"
283223,profisher25,2008-12-23 15:48:00,185,K for Wii... u wanna get Rapala Tournament Fishing!!! Amazing game... also.. if ya gotta PS2... lots of Cabellas fishing games available!!!!
283250,Guest lundboy,2008-12-23 17:01:00,0,"Here's a list of the fishing games so far for the Wii.  The Wii seems to have quite a collection, probably because of the controller.  I have Sega's and Hooked.  Sega's game play is better than hooked but it's an old port from the dreamcast so it's pretty basic.  I usually keep an eye out for used games at Microplay.  Much cheaper than buying new.  Sega's Bass Fishing Rapala's Fishing Frenzy Rapala's Tournament Fishing Bass Fishing Wii Hooked!

283253,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-23 17:34:00,3761,"not sure if it's for the wii but there is this cool rapala fishing game i saw, looked alright to me."
283295,bukee,2008-12-23 19:35:00,58,"Anyone with an iPhone, or touch screen iPod, down load ""Flick Fishing"".  It's addictive."
283617,fishboy,2008-12-24 18:47:00,550, The kids and I have a blast with this game too...and it's not a bad one to watch when you're not on the controls.
