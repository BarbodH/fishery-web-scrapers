283372,Greencoachdog,2008-12-23 23:58:00,8163, Have you and TJ caught the crabbs again???
283374,Terry,2008-12-24 00:04:00,14456,as long as it's working and you learn to read it it will do fine it's not as good as the newer ones but it sure beats not having a unit
283384,canadadude,2008-12-24 00:19:00,769,"Don't listen to all the crap about which unit is best, any flasher will give you all the info you need , I use an still do an old vex fl8 and it gives me all the info I need when ice fishing, I sorta laugh out loud when I see these dudes arguing over vex... marcum.and such all you need is a flasher to mark your presention  and your 90% better then fishing blind. Just get a unit that will pick up your presentation and your good to go"
283386,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-24 00:23:00,1362,Do any of you older lads remember or heard of the old Heathkit flasher?....
283389,canadadude,2008-12-24 00:28:00,769,"I remember that one you had it build it form a kit , thats about the same time I bought a green box remeber those old ones, good ole flashers would be perfect for ice fishers hahahaha, lowerence made the green box I think"

283395,shane,2008-12-24 00:37:00,652,  I used to have a mother-in-law that was known as 'the old campground flasher'.  We had lots of trouble with her.
283418,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-24 01:38:00,1362,  Awesome......I think I tried the heathkit flasher back in 1981

Or other flashers from around you might interfere with yours."
