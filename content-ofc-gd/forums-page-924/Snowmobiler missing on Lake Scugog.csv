According to the Kawartha Lakes Ontario Provincial Police detachment, rescue efforts to locate Grant Turner, 46, began on Saturday morning after he vanished late Friday evening. Police say the Gilson Street resident left a McGill Drive address in Janetville and was making his way home across Lake Scugog while travelling on a yellow, 1996 Bombardier Skidoo MXZ.  Police received a missing persons complaint around 11 a.m. on Saturday and an extensive search of the area was conducted on land and from the air by both the OPP helicopter and an OPP fixed-wing aircraft.  As of Sunday afternoon, according to an OPP website, authorities have yet to locate Mr. Turner or his snowmobile.  Mr. Tuner is described as a white, six feet tall and weighing 185 pounds. He has short, black hair, a fair complexion and an average build. He was last seen wearing a yellow jacket, black snow pants, a black, blue and silver coloured helmet and black Skidoo-type boots with red duct tape on the toes  Police are reminding the public to stay off Lake Scugog until a significant freeze-up has taken place. Authorities add that the heavy snowfall that has taken place over the past few days has created slushy and unsafe conditions, in particular areas where there is still open water.  Anyone knowing the whereabouts of Mr. Turner is asked to contact Ontario Provincial Police at 1-888-310-1122 or the City of Kawartha Lakes OPP Detachment at 705-324-6741."

282908,Roy,2008-12-22 19:39:00,13728,All that is known so far is that the man is missing.Maybe for his folks' and friends' sake we could hold off pointing fingers and advancing theories. Let's just hope that he is found soon. I'm not trying to be mean. I know that everyone is concerned about these things but maybe we could just wait and see....and hope that all ends well.
