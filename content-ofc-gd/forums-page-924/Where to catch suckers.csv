283635,Rizzo,2008-12-24 20:46:00,4754,"I remember as a kid growing up in Etobicoke one of my favorite things was to head down to the Humber River in the spring and catch those bugle-nosed browns. They were always accomodating, you could catch them one after the other.  Now that I've got young boys of my own (with very short attention spans) I wonder if anyone knows a creek around Barrie where i might take the boys for half an hour next spring. I think numbers of fish would be more important than size (although i guess a spring sucker is a spring sucker), and shore fishing would be ideal. I've tried the boys out on Simcoe in the boat for perch and they were already bored by the time we pulled away from the launch!"
283639,drwxr,2008-12-24 20:58:00,453,holand river around bradford. in spring they are in the river in big numbers and if you find a shallow river part it will be more interesting for them to watch than to fish.
283641,misfish,2008-12-24 21:05:00,29133,"LOVERS CREEK  There are many places along the riv/crek to catch them.  I,ll pm ya in a bit on the places to walk from the road and they will be non stop for them."
283668,Skud,2008-12-24 22:59:00,739,"Lovers Creek is the hottest spot around Barrie but there is also many smaller creeks through Alcona, Lefroy and Gilford that stack up with them. Buy a Barrie and area map to see all the creeks in the area. There are a few creeks in Oro that get them too."
283683,Rizzo,2008-12-25 00:48:00,4754,thanks for the replies. I wonder if Lovers Creek is the one that goes through Brentwood Marine. I was getting a motor fixed there last spring and I did notice a few hanging out at the culvert
283691,misfish,2008-12-25 01:41:00,29133,"Yep  Oh as for your motor,if you want it fixed right and cheap.Let me know next time.  If you know where the golf course is on Huronia ,just south of Molsen park rd,there a real small stream right by the intersection. LOADS  of them there too. It feeds Lovers creek.  Theres also that one you told me about where you said it was close to the parlor."
283702,Rizzo,2008-12-25 02:57:00,4754," hahah I may take you up on that, I wasn't quite satisfied with some of the things at Brentwood. Next time I have issues I'll let you know. maybe in the spring I'll give one or two of these places a shot. As a kid i thought it was just a hoot walking along in the humber river. By late May i would be out there in just sneakers and shorts...until i discovered a little something called the lamprey eel....just gross. (When I got older I gave up on the suckers and just went on lamprey slaughters)"
