282838,jwl,2008-12-22 16:28:00,1056,"never have any troubles on the big trib I fish until April when they let the ice boom go then it's a couple days of no fishin and a couple days of dodging ice bergs, then it's good to go again until the water gets too warm"
282918,GBW,2008-12-22 20:06:00,8460,I decided to take a drive today (gear in car of course) and check out some here in Durham.  ALL spots were frozen that I went to.  Mind you I don't know the good spots so I was just guessing of places from old posts and using my GPS to show me the rivers.  If anyone would be interested in taking a NEWBY to river fishing out PM me as I would love to give it a proper try.  Cheers. Geoff
