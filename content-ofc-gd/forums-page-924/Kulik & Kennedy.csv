First, Mark Kulik catching nice steelies.( on some great ""soloesque"" looking water ) And then Dave Kennedy smokin topwater pike !! Two of my favorite things. Killer show boys, Keep up the good work.   Oh yeah,  when is Dave Mercer giong to put on a pair of waders?LOL"

283518,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-24 13:02:00,3761,I saw their show a lot last year but i never seem to be watching tv when it's on. What are the show times for somebody that does not have WFN?
283528,K-K-DAWG,2008-12-24 14:26:00,31,"First off, ""THANK YOU"" for watching the show and supporting The World Fishing Network.  Starting with episode #7 we jump to a High Def format for a total of 45 Brand New hardcore fishing episodes throughout the `08 - `09 seasons. There is a lot more action and excitement coming in future episodes.  WFN is the real deal. Our audience coverage with WFN and their satellite partners across Canada, the U.S.A. and North America for that matter, could not be achieved with any other broadcaster. A network dedicated to fishermen, enough said!  If you want to see us, your going to have to consider getting a digital box from your cable provider. (it`s cheaper than a bag of stick worms per month and the wide assortment of show formats insures there is something for everyone regardless of your skill level)    KK http://www.extremeanglertv.com   p.s... just updated the monster mash contest prizes (Mojo anyone?)"
