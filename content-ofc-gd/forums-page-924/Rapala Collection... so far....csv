282868,StylinCatch,2008-12-22 17:59:00,43,"Im thinkin he needs a couple skitter props too, they work killer!"
282876,shane,2008-12-22 18:12:00,652,"I do most of my fishing chasing smallmouths around in the shallow waters of the Thames R. and pretty much all of my Rapalas are floating models.  My first lure of the day will almost always be a little 2inch floater in a rainbow trout pattern.  One thing I learned with the floaters is that when I get a snag and have to break it off, half the time the stupid lure will then decide to come loose and then float to the surface.  So now I try to position myself downstream before I break off and I have a chance to catch it.  Or at least a chance to wave goodbye as my $7.00 lure floats away into the sunset."
282888,jediangler,2008-12-22 18:34:00,1923,"Well Profisher25, I've caught musky on the chrome, gold chrome & perch colours. The thing I like the most about these Super Shads is you can troll them very fast and they don't roll over. Some lures once you get to a certain speed they stop wobbling and start rolling. That isn't going to catch you any fish, only twist up your line."
282909,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 19:41:00,3761,ok so i took  some advice and got a skitter pop and a husky jerk. I decided to get a big husky jerk because im trying out a little big of pike fishing this year. 
282910,solopaddler,2008-12-22 19:42:00,8605, The worst? That's easy. I bought a bunch of the Risto Raps when they came out a few years ago. I've yet to catch a single fish on any of them. (if anyone wants a bunch of Risto Raps send me your address and I'll mail them to you  )
282938,diggyj,2008-12-22 20:56:00,548,"Get yourself one of the Dave Mercer signature series lures. They work great. I had a lot of success using the DT-7 this summer. Caught bass, walleye and perch with it."
283219,Zib,2008-12-23 15:41:00,369,A super shad rap & a X-Rap Jointed shad for musky & pike fishing.    
283228,Handlebarz,2008-12-23 15:58:00,3790,I did not see one of these in your collection  
283300,Twocoda,2008-12-23 20:04:00,4130,me either ...post more blonde models....i could fish with her
282683,profisher25,2008-12-22 02:48:00,185,"This is my collection of Rapala lures that i currently have.  My lures are on the picture on the left. Left side:        /         Right side:  Skitter Pop   /   DT Series Husky Jerk #9   /   Fat Rap Husky Jerk #10   /   Rattlin' Rap Husky Jerk #12   /   Clackin' Rap 08 Minnow Rap  Any suggestions on what else I should buy in terms of Rapala lures?    Also, the lures on the right picture belong to my buddy ""The Bass Fisher"",  he just wanted to get some feedback on his lures, and get any suggestions on new lures to buy.  "
282685,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 02:49:00,3761,"Nice man, but u need to get some X-Raps...that being said i don't have a massive collection either."
282686,BassAsin,2008-12-22 02:51:00,806,personally i think the taildancer is a good lure depending on what you chase and every colour of every size of the J series
282688,BassAsin,2008-12-22 02:53:00,806,like the NK mag orange monkey puke is the GL rainbow colour of choice for me!
282689,Raf,2008-12-22 02:54:00,3495,try a j-9 or j-11. catches everything.
282693,forrest,2008-12-22 02:59:00,1032,"A lot depends on what/where you fish...but as far as Rapala goes  I noticed a lack of silver minnow colors.  The Rapala original floaters and jointed are good all around lures, along with Xraps they are probably a staple of most tackle kits.  about $7.50-$8.50 each:  http://www.rapala.com/products/luresdetail...eshorsalt=Fresh http://www.rapala.com/products/luresdetail...Both&live=1  forrest PS: is that a blue/black original floater in there?"
282695,danc,2008-12-22 03:02:00,4677,"Nice collection you got started. My boxes are stuffed with Countdowns.  Don't ""count"" them out!!"

282718,kentooley,2008-12-22 04:12:00,208,Xrap Clown for smallies & pike.
282719,jwl,2008-12-22 04:14:00,1056,"X-raps and Husky Jerks for sure, the more natural colours...like black/silver and some of the new ""glass colours"" as well, like the perch ones and this is what you might come home with..... "
282723,Twocoda,2008-12-22 04:45:00,4130,"Rattlin Raps ...all the way ...every colour pattern and size......most verstatile lure i ever used ...EVERYTHING from perch to kings ....there now i said it ...the secret is out... the red and white one in the right photo is a salmon slayer up here...regardless of the collection you end up with over time ...you will always have YOUR ""old reliables""  for me its any of the rattlers.."
282724,profisher25,2008-12-22 04:48:00,185,"i agree with you on the rattlin' raps, they work very well on choppy water for smallmouth!"
282725,Sugarpacket,2008-12-22 04:52:00,82,"X-Raps for sure dude, clown's my fav color  Another Rich post under the Sugarpacket name.. I gotta get her her own computer! lol"
282726,Victor,2008-12-22 05:31:00,1609," lol ... I'm tempted to start a thread to see what people has to say about ""worst rapala out of all the models"" ... it seems that they engineer great products and there isn't any that people dislike.  personally i think you should get some original floaters as well."
282744,OhioFisherman,2008-12-22 09:42:00,6623,Also had some real good days with the original floater. anywhere from the 2 inch ones to 7 inch ones. They make a good lure that seems to work well.
282756,jediangler,2008-12-22 12:10:00,1923,"Don't forget a big Super Shad for musky, pike, walleye & big bass. If I could only buy one, it would be the perch model. "
282767,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 12:45:00,3761,"I don't know if anyone has noticed but that is my collection on the far left. I have money and plans to be gettting a skitter pop,another x-rap slashbait,and a new lure called the x-rap shad shallow...then im goin for things such as the origional floater or husky jerk's... Thanks Profisher for putting up my pic, and hopefully i'll get some feedback aswell"
282768,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 12:47:00,3761," good choice, but there like 10-13bucks lol. I've seen them at canadian tire and i do plan on getting one of them sometime...if u look on the BPS website they come in a yelllow perch colour that looks really good."
282773,Radnine,2008-12-22 13:02:00,1538,"Has anyone noticed that Wall-mart has some of their Rapalas on for $7.00? On Rapalas, when it comes to fishing I am as lazy as a spotted dog, and love nothing more than trolling around dragging a Rapala. I have caught a boat load of fish on regular and jointed silver and black, and gold and black. I am starting to buy more deep divers just to try to get to different levels of the lakes. Love the Rapala! Jim"
282806,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-22 14:38:00,4399,"I don`t see any Mercer magic in the collection, no Rapala collection would be complete with out a little Mercer`s magic. Right Dave!!"
282866,profisher25,2008-12-22 17:52:00,185,"  Im thinking about buying a Super Shad Rap, which pattern should I buy?? Im down to a few options.... either the #06 Shad, #17 Yellow Perch, or #41 Silver Shiner??  PM me if you can, that would be great!"
