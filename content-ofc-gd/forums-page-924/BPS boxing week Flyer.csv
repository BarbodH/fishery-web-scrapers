282815,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 15:32:00,3761,That rapala digital fish scale works great...i got mine around this time last year and must of pulled it out and used it over 100 times. still on the fiirst battery to. Excellent buy if anyone is interested.
282912,Mattones,2008-12-22 19:48:00,587,A friend of mine who works there said Diamond Justices will be on sale Cheap. I bought one a while ago great bow!
282920,Canuck2fan,2008-12-22 20:14:00,1444,"If you really want the ice auger at that price you could try to get the deal before the sale starts, quoting the price in the flyer...  Or check to see that if you pay full price today but go in during the sale will they refund the difference? Just make sure you can return if they won't.  Which leads to the dirtiest trick of all, buy it today at regular price and then ""return"" it during the sale and have a companion buy it right back at the cheaper price LOL.  All the media outlets are saying retailers NEED our dollars so it can't hurt to try all of these three ways to make everyone happy.  Also I almost forgot if you are in there just before closing on the 24th the sale price might already be in the system? This is a good one to remember at your local zellers and CTC the price is almost always changed the night before and if the item is limited quanity it is sometimes the only way to get the item..."
283226,profisher25,2008-12-23 15:50:00,185,Im thinking the Rapala digital scale and rod rack are so far my favorite things on that flyer!
283231,ch312,2008-12-23 16:03:00,1590," ive done this quite a few times to make sure i get what i want at sale price. find out that something is going on sale by asking employees, friends, flyers, etc and then go buy it 2 weeks before the sale starts. when the sale begins, go in with your receipt and tell them you bought something that is now on sale and you would like to be refunded the difference. as far as i know, stores must do this if you purchased the item within 2 weeks of the sale.  just did it again a couple weeks ago at canadian tire. bought a michelin floor jack and stands and ended up getting $65 back after the sale started. imagine that, they were sold out when i went to get some money back  id gladly do it for the auger at BPS, but its over an hour away and i dont have the cash right now. anyone wanna buy me an xmas gift?"
283248,BillM,2008-12-23 16:48:00,17367,Nice set of Simms waders if anyone needs a pair.  Can't beat $150 for breathables.
283290,mikeh,2008-12-23 19:24:00,824,I was at BPS today and they had the rod racks on the floor for the sale price.
283292,bassjnkie,2008-12-23 19:26:00,1101, Did you notice if they had the Browning bags on the floor.
283297,mikeh,2008-12-23 19:43:00,824,"Daniel, I didn't notice if they had those bags out. Sounds like you might have to take a trip over there ."
283315,bassjnkie,2008-12-23 20:44:00,1101,"I left after I posted and I'm back. They don't have the bags out, and won't have them till the 26, I guess I will have to stand in line."
283353,GBW,2008-12-23 22:44:00,8460,"Are those the winter ones?  if so, I' heading to Barrie in a few days for a few days so I might just have to stop in..."
