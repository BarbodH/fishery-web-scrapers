I drilled about 12 holes before we marked actice fish.  Once we did we set up shelter, turned on the heater, and slayed those panfish.  We must have got over 100 bluegills a piece. (tiny though)  Brought home 10 (oksize) ones for the belly.  All in all, a good day,. Met a couple of guy's from the board...(dont remember the names...)  Got to fish some new ice.   Cheers,  Jim"

283247,silvio,2008-12-23 16:46:00,433,Any crappie?
283310,iceslayer,2008-12-23 20:28:00,97,"Yeah, we got about 10 crappies and 2 were an OK size.  Most of them were about 4-5"".   Jim"

283480,waterwolf,2008-12-24 05:18:00,556,"oh yeah , that was a good blow all right . i was out on it too!  glad you got into some pans . keeping a few is always cool .but she's been closed for a while due to over-harvest,,if you enjoy fishing the lake ,,keep 6 on your neighbors . sometimes a lake could use a buddy to suggest some restraint on the catch&keep if you bare witness ,, ya know what i mean? i find most are receptive."
283482,Pguzik,2008-12-24 05:30:00,34,"Valens will take a few years to bounce back, but  there is a lake not too far from Valens where I catch crappie in the 12'' to 14'' limit regularly. and YES it is a conservation area  P."
