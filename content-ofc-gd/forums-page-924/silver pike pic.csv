282476,codered,2008-12-21 21:27:00,123,Well its been a long time butt i finaly got my pictures from a friend last night. I caught 4 pike like this the weekend of september 14th.. the same lake holds normal northern pike ... thought I would post this rare find
282478,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-21 21:33:00,1362,yum yum...a little bit of worm flavored moss salad and a Carling Lager to wash it down with!!  that is a rare find....thanks for sharing
282479,Rich,2008-12-21 21:35:00,3927,"Jeeze, I thought the Filth Hound was well suited to it's name, that one takes the Filth cake. lol  Interesting pike there."
282490,codered,2008-12-21 21:55:00,123," ""LOL  you thought that was bad  check this out ....."
282491,jediangler,2008-12-21 21:55:00,1923,"By the red in the tail, I'd say it's a red finned pickeral, not a pike. Were they all that small? That is about full grown size for a pickeral."
282505,codered,2008-12-21 22:16:00,123,I caught 4 that weekend and the biggist was about 4 lbs.. the year before my uncle caught one just over 10 lbs.. after research I was convinced it was a silver pike.... Butt still not to sure ... any info would be greatly appreciated......
282510,pike slayer,2008-12-21 22:23:00,1177,sweeeeet boat! thats a boat that your mother would be proud of lol. you could have atleast put the fish on a stringer lol
282511,Leecher,2008-12-21 22:25:00,7832,Did a quick google search and this looks very similar    Leechman
282527,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-21 22:53:00,2038,   Now had did a pic of my boat show up on OFC like this
282558,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-21 23:37:00,1362," That can't be a pic of your boat Paul....I didn't think that you drank beer...at least that's what I thought because of the few times you came out to the house to go fishin' in my boat, you came empty handed"
282591,jediangler,2008-12-22 00:17:00,1923,"My mistake CodeRed, you are probably right about the silver pike. A 10lb red-fin pickeral would be a world record. My BAD   ."
282605,Rizzo,2008-12-22 00:44:00,4754,"that fish is neat, but the boat....oi vey"
282665,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-22 02:23:00,3761,"Very cool pike, as for the boat mess here is the opposite and my boat after i've been in it lol.    Thanks for sharing!"
283215,profisher25,2008-12-23 15:35:00,185,"Thats very interesting.. a silver pike, i wonder why they are silver.. i mean.. they believe that the blue walleye gets its blue from the lack of color in the water or something.. i could be wrong, but i heard that on a fishing show."
283598,codered,2008-12-24 17:47:00,123,If it was something in the water that turned them silver  wouldn't all the pike in that lake be silver? i dont know and the information is hard to find...To me it looks like a different species of pike all together kinda like a walleye  vs  sauger butt who knows ....I will still enjoy catching them in years to come ..  Just adds a little something special to the little lake I love so much.... thx for all the posts guys  keep those lines tight   and hooks  sharp  ... Merry Christmas
