986334,slidehammer,2016-11-16 02:32:00,28,I have been fishing with rapalas since the early 70s. I remember using my Pa's lures out of his old metal tackle box. God forbid if I ever got a snag and lost one. Was in my favorite tackle shop and picked up a couple of new lures but I'm not sure if I should fish them or  take the hooks off and make earrings out of them for a Christmas gift for my gal. 
986335,manitoubass2,2016-11-16 02:41:00,11391,Fish em.  Pm me if ya want jewellery.  Winter hobby for me
986336,GBW,2016-11-16 02:43:00,8460,"Fish em.  Pm me if ya want jewellery.  Winter hobby for me I say fish them too However Rick has ""some esplain' to do...""  hehe  sorry"
986340,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 03:29:00,8243,For the price of some new lures I would be afraid to tie one on in case I loose it. Wall hangers.
986345,mike rousseau,2016-11-16 11:04:00,4661,Don't look at high end musky baits  A DK fifty finder just auctioned for $169 USD last week lol
986350,dave524,2016-11-16 12:57:00,4508,"Kinda look the old L&S Mirrolures we used to drag around 50 plus years ago, but with a cheap plastic lip not metal."
986352,Moosebunk,2016-11-16 13:41:00,3970,"Today's lure prices are ridiculous.  I look at companies like Jackall the past couple years, Live Target the years before that, and shake my head. Rapala is a proven winner for anglers around the world and their prices are lower.  Hopefully people don't buy too much of the over-priced other options. Would hate to see all other reasonable lure companies look to raise prices within the margins.  You gotta take those there beasts Slide, and drag'em just behind the boat on St.Clair with a long bite leader to keep 'em in your tackle box for later."
986410,Jds63,2016-11-16 18:58:00,1365,All the new fancy expensive lures are designed to catch the fisherman first ... ?
986411,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 19:03:00,8243,There are only so many new innovations tackle companies can come up with every year to hook a fisherman but they all seem to be able to.
986417,Jds63,2016-11-16 19:26:00,1365,I remember watching the commercials for the Banjo Minnow system and I was caught ... had to buy the whole package ... lol Still have some ...
986433,pics,2016-11-16 20:48:00,1268,I no longer use my little Cleos that have the topless wiggling girl.. almost any other old lure is ok...lol
986450,manitoubass2,2016-11-17 01:33:00,11391,"My gpa was a baller.  His tackle box was full of gold jigs, 1 oz jigs at that.  I wont fish em or ever get rid of them.  They could put my kids through college lol"
986459,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-17 03:00:00,8243,I bought no less than 100 plugs and spoons from a guy that owned a flea market in Jarvis a few years ago. I have about 2 grand of antique lures.  A few original Eppinger Dare Devils and Little Cleos. All for 40 bucks including the cardboard box. A few lures that have the company names went out of business in the early 20th century. I will never sell them. I bet my wife does when I'm dust for 45 bucks.
986460,manitoubass2,2016-11-17 03:04:00,11391,Im first in line???  J/k but seriously if and when I pass ill have my wife send ya a gold jig(and ya better not sell it)
