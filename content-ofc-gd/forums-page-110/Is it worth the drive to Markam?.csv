985950,captpierre,2016-11-12 22:50:00,2521,Did a week ago
985957,chefboi17,2016-11-13 00:34:00,128,"Lure selection isn't too bad considering the sale has been going on for a few weeks, everything else is getting scarce, somehow I still managed to spend 300$ today"
985961,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-13 01:02:00,8243,"I just did a fall clean up of all my tackle in my Man closet, Man sheds and my boat. I have a few thousand dollars of tackle I haven't used in 15 years. Unfortunately somehow water got into a few trays in my built in trays on the StarCraft, 8 in total and I threw our a few hundred bucks worth or more, I cried like a baby. Take it from me be careful or you too will become a tackle hoarder. I stopped at a local Swap shop TODAY in Cayuga and bought more reels I don't need and will probably never use. Happy shopping, can I join you?"

985984,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-13 04:09:00,8243,Chris let me make an offer on the Currado 200.
985994,Tjames09,2016-11-13 05:50:00,664,"If it was a week ago maybe, not now.....I went on Friday the 4th, they had lots of lures, reels, and rods. I went back on the 7th and basically it was all gone. So that was a week ago, Id imagine most things are cleared out."
