985812,netminder,2016-11-11 19:19:00,514,"Sorry my spell check attacked me. Thanks for the personal attack. Let's hope I can do the same for you some day wasn't intended to be personal, but when your entire argument against me is to just say you're wrong it really makes for an excellent debate.  I still don't think it's right, but if enough people got angry enough and caused enough havoc, do you think the elected officials would just brush them aside and say they're just kids throwing a temper tantrum, or do you think they would say, gee, these people are really upset over this. And like I said before, they're there to govern all people. If you just ignore the minority because they're the minority then democracy doesn't work, in spite of what you say about popular votes and majority rule. Democracy is about compromise and inclusion, not about winning or who's right and who's wrong. I still think Trump is a buffoon and I would never in a million years vote for him or his party, but I'm hopeful some productive things can get done while he's in office. And if something gets said or done that people don't like, protest it. Like Trump himself says, if the other side is going to go to an extreme sometimes you have to go to extremes to meet in the middle."

In interviews, these people dont even know the electoral college has played a huge part in deciding presidential elections since when??? Off the top of my head Ill say 1786 or 88. Its nothing new.

985827,netminder,2016-11-11 20:35:00,514,"FYI, it's actually pretty rare to have a President who lost the popular vote, it's only happened 5 times in US history (1824, 1876,1888, 2000 and 2016).  Just did the math, there have been 56 Presidential elections, so just under 9% of elections have had this outcome. And this was the same thing that got Michael Moore all fired up in one of his ""documentaries"" probably the 2000 one -- Oh, and lo and behold he's back in the limelight lately too.  I don't know if reforming the electoral college is exactly what they're protesting, other than the fact it would let them get their way. I think it's genuine fear of more discrimination and hate crime against them (speaking of visible minorities, Muslims, women, etc.). But aren't we getting too focused on the president? The house and senate are both controlled by the republicans too."

985840,John Bacon,2016-11-11 21:13:00,3277,"In interviews, these people dont even know the electoral college has played a huge part in deciding presidential elections since when??? Off the top of my head Ill say 1786 or 88. Its nothing new. Its there because 50% of people in the US live in less than 5% of US landmass.   The electoral college doesn't really address that.  More populous states get more votes (California has 55, while some states only have 3).  Within the states, big cities have more influence than small towns.  If measure by land area, the Republicans got about 90% of Illinois; but the Democrats got Chicago so the state went blue.  Even with the electoral college, each states influence in the college is roughly equivalent to its population; within each state, each city or towns influence is based on it's population.  So the electoral college does not change the fact the big cities (where most people live) have more clout than rural areas (which have most of the land).  The reason that Trump was able to win the college while loosing the popular vote was because he won some big states by close margins while Hillary won her big states by large margins.  Trump picked all of the votes for Pennsylvania, Florida, and Michigan by winning just a few more votes than Hillary in those states.  If you win the state you win the state regardless of how close it is.  Hillary earned a lot of the popular vote by her landslide victories in California and New York.  But there is no advantage to winning by big margins.   Imagine if they didnt have the electoral college? Then Hillary would have won the presidency, but Trump WOULD BE VICE PRESIDENT."
985841,leaf4,2016-11-11 21:13:00,2466,"From what I've gathered on the whole process is people choose what info they find, they search for the information that fuels the hate against trump and it's ignorance is bliss when it come to the wikileaks against Hillary.  I see people whining about how bad Trump is etc, they haven't bothered researching to make sure their behind is nice and clean. I saw a video the other day after the election and it was literally the first pro trump anything I have seen on TV, I have watched some online personalities like Tomi Lahren spout about trump and how great he is and how great it will be but she's so far right wing it's unbearable at times.  Here's a video you'd NEVER see on CNN or any other left wing bias media outlets because it would skew the obvious pictures they are painting and agenda they are pushing.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10150681022754943&id=510814942  Edit: as much as I didn't care about this election at all, I figured Hillary would win riding the coat tails of Obamas success, so I was kind of surprised that trump did win, and what can I say, I'm optimistic for them, he's a wildcard and not the person the left wings push as a misogynist etc, I really do like the idea of a non politician bucking the system"

I do not have a preference on Dem or Rep it is a label that is as vague as American or Canadian in my eyes. thank you for pointing this out but it is not my motive but I can now appreciate it now.   Art  Art, I certainly didn't mean to question your motives.  I was simply pointing out my perception of bias.  I am going to say my piece and then leave you alone.  I'm going to quote a few members but I am not calling out individuals, I have no personal bias against these members.     Millennials with nothing better to do than cry and pout when they don't get their way. They don't like to work unless it's on their terms (meaning come in late, leave early, and spend the day on Facebook). They believe protesting is just as important as working...crying out for someone to recognize something they say as being valuable or worthy...which it rarely is. I""m sure this will ruffle some, but I'm only going on what I see around me. I've stop hiring Millennials which is sad, but a few bad apples have spoiled it for all the rest. I heard a quote from a Millennial in Portland that stated they're setting an example for all Americans on how to stand up for what is right. What a joke. Since when is destruction of property and assault 'right'? How about stand behind a lawfully elected official...and don't throw a tantrum when your candidate loses.  This is hardly civil and most certainly negative and demeaning to all members who may be ""millennial"".  It is a broad brushed characterization of an entire segment of society.  All millennials pout and cry when they don't get their way?  All millennials don't like to work?  They, as a group, rarely have anything valuable or interesting or worthy to say?  Can we be more condescending to a whole segment of society?  Perhaps yes, but this is pretty good hit job without expanding on it.  If you replaced the word millennial with any identifiable minority the post takes on a very different meaning (NOT suggesting that T-Bone feels this way or anything like that!).  I would hazard a guess that we not only have millennial members, but would like to attract some more.  Just sayin'  ​Not hard to understand at all Cliff when you realize the instigators are all paid to cause trouble by George Soros. For instance the protesters in Austin Texas were all bused in to create havoc!!!  http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3492176/posts  These protesters are being gathered by the same people that did it during the election. ​It's all the doing of a billionaire globalist trying to cause a revolution in the US to get his way.

One, it's not at all civil to wish people dead.  If SirCranks had wished Trump dead, would that be okay?  Second, you indicate that members should back up their claims with ""proof"".

If this is the burden of proof required than I can say literally anything as long as it exists anywhere on the internet and I source it.

DRIFTER and T-Bone, I'm sure this will ring hollow but nothing personal against either of you.  Feel free to rebut me or not.

985803,John Bacon,2016-11-11 18:45:00,3277,"WikiLeaks posted about how the DNC undermined the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. If true, that's the true undermining of democracy and they got a serving of humble pie putting their support behind Clinton, who wasn't even favourable to voters to begin with-so corrupted. I feel that they've failed on all accounts on doing what's best for the people. I'm sure the Clinton supporters were looking for a big fat pay cheque when Clinton was suppose to win the election. And they were probably even celebrating a bit too early when they realized that Trump was the opposition, thinking it would be an easy win. For the most part, I think their arrogance grossly underestimated Trump, as had most critics were in the early stages of the election, and it blew up in their faces.  This is all speculation on my part Yes, it is true that they undermined Bernie Sanders.  The debate questions were provided to Clinton, but not Bernie, ahead of time.  I don't think that was the only advantage that they party gave to Clinton.  That may very well have been the downfall for the Democrats.  Trump didn't win by getting more votes for the Republicans; he won because of a drop in the votes for the Democrats.  Trump actually had the fewest votes of all major candidates (including Hillary Clinton) in the last three elections.  http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/eligible-voter-turnout-for-2016-data-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-republican-democrat-popular-vote-registered-results/ "
