I can not believe that some people here spend more time arguing over U.S Politics and FORGET THE MEANING OF THIS DAY... FOR SHAME>>> Jimmer I am very happy that you appreciated the music I was able to find.... I have heard In A Pittance of Time many times and it always get in to my throat .... Highway of Heroes was written by my dear friend Terry Sumsion before he passed from cancer.
