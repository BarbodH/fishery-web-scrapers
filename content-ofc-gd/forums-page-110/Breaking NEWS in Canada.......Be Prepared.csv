986371,JoePa,2016-11-16 15:57:00,179,"Great - the ones not going to Canada are either rioting or crying like a bunch of babies - I was losing faith in the people of this country but the vote last Tuesday gave me hope again - our colleges are full of spoiled brates who don't even know what life is all about - letting 18 year olds vote was a big mistake - once they get jobs, raise a family, buy a house .etc and do something worthwhile they hopefully will realize what is going on -"
986379,Mister G,2016-11-16 16:40:00,1429,"shut this thread down before it turns into another joke It ""IS"" a joke. Now you may have to confer with former President Clinton on the definition of ""IS""."

Definitely time to raise the voting age back to 21 like it was in my day."

986426,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 19:51:00,8243,"If the age of vote eligibility was based on maturity the age to vote would be 35. For some they would never be able to vote.  I have read about those that truly wish to immigrate here and spoken to American relatives and friends. They were all amazed how difficult it is to move into Canada. Some thought you showed up at the border and just crossed the line with a bit of paper work.  And yes Art it is the same 2 or 3 members that get these threads locked out spoiling mature dialogue from the other members. One is actually asking you to lock it out, saves him typing I guess.  Can't you just lock them out and let the adults play?"
986427,blaque,2016-11-16 20:08:00,2419,"Wait, i thought this got locked? Oh ya.....nevermind, that was the last two threads on the same topic smh  The mods must have a migraine the size of texas, or california...........depending"
986429,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-16 20:21:00,8243,"I was down your way recently Blaque. Played a round at Arrow Head with a few cousins from Akron and Pembroke. One teaches and coaches Baseball at Pembroke High. Had wings at Indian Falls, nothing much has changed there in the 50 plus years since I first went to the area. Beautiful countryside."
