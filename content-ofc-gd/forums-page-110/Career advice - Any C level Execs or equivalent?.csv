985553,grimsbylander,2016-11-09 17:23:00,3016,What specifically are you wondering about? Not sure if I can assist?  - Vice President Sales and Business Development
985600,Steve,2016-11-09 23:27:00,2075,"some advice to get to the ""c"" level?  well, if your company is national, or multi-national, expect to have an MBA, even though it is - for the most part - a waste a time.  small companies you can still get to the ""c"" level without the MBA.  for most of my colleagues who are at the ""c"" level, most wish they could go back to doing what they were doing prior to the promotion...as you will work far more hours than you are paid for.  but for those who want to rise to the top, and being in one place isn't sufficient, being a 'c' level exec is the place to be."
