985753,Dutch01,2016-11-11 14:32:00,1431,"I took today off so I could stay out late last night and it paid off. I hit two spots and got 5 fish in total (65cm, 55cm, 53cm, 45cm and 41cm).  Night pics are never great on an iPhone but here's a picture of the big girl. She weighed in at 5.4 pounds.    Fish were caught on bobber and minnow or Pickerel rig/drop shot. It was a nice night out but that wind was something else. I'll be out again Saturday. Good luck!"

985863,RangerGuy,2016-11-11 23:58:00,564,Nice! You guys posting these pics are killing me hahaha!  Thanks for sharing!
985866,Moosebunk,2016-11-12 00:07:00,3970,"I guess ""Dutch"" is European...  Measures in centimeters.  That could be a first here.  Great fishing regardless."
985867,GBW,2016-11-12 00:22:00,8460,Measures in centimeters.  That could be a first here. I always do too as zone 17 is 35 to 50 cm keepers on most lakes.  Balsam is the one exception

985890,Freshtrax,2016-11-12 04:14:00,2215,I need to do some exploring around home here for a good shore walleye spot .  Looks like a blast.
985894,chris.brock,2016-11-12 12:54:00,4053," Nice haul Dutch!  The super moon is Monday night, I bet that would be a good night to be out there and wrap up the season."
985905,Dutch01,2016-11-12 14:10:00,1431,"Thanks Chris. I'm expecting it to be busy at ""the spot"" tonight. I also took off Wednesday so I can spend Tuesday night there. I'm think I might try going Monday after work if I can too. Time to make hay while the Sun is shining. Then I have to find something else to catch while I wait for ice...."
