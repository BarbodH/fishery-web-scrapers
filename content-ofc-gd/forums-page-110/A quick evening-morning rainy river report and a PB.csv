But first I had chores etc so when those were done, it was already 5pm by the time we hit the river.  Absolutely gorgoeus out! +21 and barely a breeze!  The bite was slow but we managed a few small walleye and a couple nice crappie?  Really cool thing happened. 4 casts in a row and I caught 4 species...  First came a 26"" northern, then a 15"" walleye, then a 13"" crappie and finally a rock bass. That was pretty cool!  Today we headed out early, again, beauty of a day! By 9am it was already +16. Woot woot  We laid tobacco as per usual and got a nice 19"" walleye second cast!  Then a 15""er, a few rock bass, then a hefty 28"" pike.  A few more good eaters and she was almost time to head in.  Then bang! Fish on! Not me but Lily! Her first walleye as a 6 year old and she fought it like a champ! Her arms tired, the fish finally showed itself! A quick measure and pic and there it is, her new PB walleye, 18""???  Miigwich for reading                 "

985331,manitoubass2,2016-11-06 22:28:00,11391,"@jd63  Nothing but GREAT times. Nature is also a pretty good babysitter if ya ask me.  Thanks wkrp, benson and gallie!!!  I never measured it Geoff, just a guess. Maybe 14"" but I doubt any bigger. She was fat though! And guess what was in her belly? A frog!  Only fish I measured was Lilys walleye just so I know what she has to beat next time!"
