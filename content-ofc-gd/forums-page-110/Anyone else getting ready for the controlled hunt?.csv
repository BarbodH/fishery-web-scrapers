985720,Oggie,2016-11-11 02:04:00,588,"Love the colour and the height of the rack, Bil.  Great shot!  I'd have that mounted as well.  Might be the deer of your life. Hopefully not but that's a beauty!"
985725,kickingfrog,2016-11-11 02:47:00,8333,Big buck.
985734,porkpie,2016-11-11 04:22:00,2521,"Nice deer, very high tined, should make an impressive mount on the wall!"
985736,manitoubass2,2016-11-11 05:45:00,11391,Nice going bill!!! Now time for the good eats!  Whats your choice in rifles?
985742,BillM,2016-11-11 12:59:00,17367,Thanks man!  Only shotgun/bow or muzzleloader down in this WMU(No rifle season).  Used my Browning A5 'Humpback' with a Hastings rifled slug barrel.
985745,dave524,2016-11-11 13:23:00,4508,"WOW, nice buck, great tine length and mass."
985746,manitoubass2,2016-11-11 13:27:00,11391,"Thatyll do the trick! 250 dressed is nice indeed!  My buddy jeff gotta good one two days back as well thats a mounter. Deer are thick this year up our way.  The mine seems to have pushed fairly huge population of ""wild deer"" right onto our laps(as opposed to the ""farm"" deer)"
985766,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-11-11 15:10:00,535,"Awesome buck, congrats! That must have been quite the thrill!  I saw a doe and two fawns 20' in front of my blind Monday morning, the doe walked up to 10' in front of me. Had another doe come around about 15 minutes later as well, nothing since. Only have a buck tag though and haven't seen one all week. None on the trail cam since Sunday night either when I had 3 on there (two of which were rucking). So I've been out hunting grouse more than deer the past couple of days."
985773,farsider,2016-11-11 15:52:00,456,"Sweet Buck Bill!  NIce mass and length!  Nicely done.  Some good eating there.  Cheers, Mark"
985784,BillM,2016-11-11 16:56:00,17367,Thanks guys! Here's a side shot that really shows how thick his neck is.   Going up tonight to cut those tenderloins out and have them for dinner  
985789,Terry,2016-11-11 17:13:00,14456,nice size
985791,Rodbender,2016-11-11 17:24:00,1027,Beauty Buck for sure Bill
985793,Sinker,2016-11-11 17:36:00,8692,Nice! Is that a rocking chair on his head? Hes a beauty!!
985795,manitoubass2,2016-11-11 17:39:00,11391,No doubt! That rack is oddly perfect!
985796,manitoubass2,2016-11-11 17:45:00,11391,"Bill, here is my buddie Jeffs buck!  Hes a hangin now, good eats tomorrow night!  "
985821,misfish,2016-11-11 20:13:00,29133,"Billy, well done buddy. Sweet buck."
985853,OhioFisherman,2016-11-11 22:18:00,6623,"Thanks guys! Here's a side shot that really shows how thick his neck is.   Going up tonight to cut those tenderloins out and have them for dinner   Nice! One of my son's buddies got one here yesterday, only around 180 lbs though. Bow season here."
985889,Freshtrax,2016-11-12 04:13:00,2215,"Nice going, I haven't hunted since my days in NC .  I'm finally going this weekend to get my PAL and hunter safety.   Going to try to fill a tag with the crossbow the last 2 weeks of the year as I'm off work anyways.   Hope a beast like that strolls my way."
985071,BillM,2016-11-02 13:46:00,17367,"I've got 50 acres in 76c that I'm hunting next week, can't wait!   Going to pick up the SD cards from the camera today, hopefully there's stuff on there other then rabbits and squirrels"
985074,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-11-02 15:53:00,535,Not the controlled but this will be my first year hunting deer. Can't wait until next week! I just hope the bears would go to sleep already lol. I get a lot more deer here when they're not around.
985086,porkpie,2016-11-02 18:58:00,2521,I hunt the December controlled hunt and have done so for the last 10 years.  That way I get a week of rifle in november and dabble in the shotgun hunt on my regular days off and don't have to use any vacation!  Seems to me that the December hunt is one of the few times I hunt deer with snow on the ground anymore!  Good luck!
985087,BillM,2016-11-02 19:09:00,17367,"Thanks, you to!  My rifle hunt out at my buddies place is two weeks, so if my controlled hunt doesn't go well I've got a back up.  Then there's always muzzleloader as well."
985088,Oggie,2016-11-02 19:21:00,588,"I've got 50 acres in 76c that I'm hunting next week, can't wait!   Going to pick up the SD cards from the camera today, hopefully there's stuff on there other then rabbits and squirrels Hopefully there's still a camera!  I gave up using one."
985089,BillM,2016-11-02 19:24:00,17367,"Hopefully there's still a camera!  I gave up using one.  It's private property, so I'm hoping they're still there when I go check."
985090,Rodbender,2016-11-02 19:35:00,1027,Good Luck out there Bill post a few pic's of the big guy you get I'll be chasing a 12 Point buck early Saturday morning with the camera  I started out as a hunter fisherman from an early age still have my hunting licence but I prefer now to go with a camera

985112,mikeh,2016-11-03 02:59:00,824,"for all of non hunters, maybe someone can explain what a 'controlled hunt' is?"
985113,manitoubass2,2016-11-03 03:19:00,11391,Just watch The Hunger Games ???  Good luck out there guys!
985114,dave524,2016-11-03 03:47:00,4508,"for all of non hunters, maybe someone can explain what a 'controlled hunt' is?  Controlled hunter numbers, apply in a lottery in August for a tag, usually more applications than tags for most zones."
985201,ratherboutdoors,2016-11-04 14:06:00,132,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnHNqvOB42M  Not sure if the link will work, but it's one of my favorites up at camp....  Gets the blood flowing!  Google Da Tirty Point Buck by Da Yoopers (if the link doesn't work.)  Good luck!"
985202,Tom S,2016-11-04 14:11:00,362,I'm getting ready to avoid the bush around here. Way to many yahoos with guns trespassing and shooting at anything that moves during the controlled hunt in this area.
985203,glen,2016-11-04 14:26:00,2641,30pt.   Lol. Try 2nd week of deer camp.
985211,Sinker,2016-11-04 19:19:00,8692,Ditto. Best time of year to be in the marsh shooting ducks.  S.
985214,misfish,2016-11-04 20:41:00,29133,"Ditto. Best time of year to be in the marsh shooting ducks.  S.  Before I started deer hunting Shane, I was into the ducks big time. You are bang on about the best time to be in the swamp."
985229,kickingfrog,2016-11-05 01:48:00,8333,Yep. The grouse are safe (from me at least) for a week. Good luck deer hunters.
985230,Fish Farmer,2016-11-05 02:20:00,2234,90A for me. Think this will be my last hunt.
985241,pics,2016-11-05 14:09:00,1268,I enjoy the bow hunt due to the lack of yahoo trespassers.. my spot will be screwed up for a while due to them but thankfully we already filled our doe tag...
985714,BillM,2016-11-11 01:43:00,17367,"Well tonight was the night!  Setup around 3pm and this monster decides to stroll through around 4.  Had to find an opening between the pine trees in order to get a shot but I made it (He was booking it pretty good)  Dropped him at about 50yrds.  You can tell I was a little bit excited.  Can't wait to score him, definitely getting a head mount done.  Biggest deer I've ever shot!  "
985716,chris.brock,2016-11-11 01:51:00,4053," Sweet Billy, the smile says it all! You're a tall guy, what's your guess on weight?  damn I wish I had more time and freedom to do stuff"
985718,BillM,2016-11-11 01:56:00,17367,Thanks Chris!  Couldn't help but smile.  We're guessing around 250 field dressed.  He is a big boy.
