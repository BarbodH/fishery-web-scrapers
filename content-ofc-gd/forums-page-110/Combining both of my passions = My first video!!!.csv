Nothing serious here when it comes to fishing or the songwriting stuff as it's all just for the fun of it. I got a Go Pro in the spring and I've been filming all of my fishing adventures since then. I also wrote and recorded some original fishing songs to accompany my videos. I figure that I probably have enough footage to make 4-5 videos.  Check it out, I hope you enjoy!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3D0d4Jz-k"

Tons of amazing footage there, wow...Love the float tube brookies especially, are you trout fishing in On or Qc?  To me living in Ottawa means enjoying the fishing opportunities on both sides of the Ottawa river. Some of those brookies in the video were caught in Ontario and some were caught in Quebec."
