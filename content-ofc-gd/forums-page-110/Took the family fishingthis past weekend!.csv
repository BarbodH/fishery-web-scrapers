985783,tb4me,2016-11-11 16:48:00,3295,We decided to hit the Trent river for one last stab at the Walleye gold. We did great..My daughter once again is the walleye master..She landed 2 19 inchers in 15 minutes and lost what only be described as a LARGE golden snake in the night water. Im thing it was 26 to 27 inch walleye..She tried to horse the beast in and off it went before I could even get the net..She made up for it though.. We had a blast and caught some dinner..Thanks for looking and I hope your family fishing adventures are just as productive and fun!Lest We Forget.......

985913,tb4me,2016-11-12 16:07:00,3295,Thanks for the comments folks.. We sure had a nice time. Walleye is closed as of the 15 th so that will be it for this season...Its a good thing the Grand River is open until Jan 01! No boat on the Grand but shore fishing will do.
