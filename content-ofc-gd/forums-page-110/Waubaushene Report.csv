Not very exciting LOL!  I marked 2 fish on the screen and caught 1 small mouth on a Lindy rigged minnow.  The hunt for GBay walleye continues!  Sorry not very exciting report but was a beautiful fall day!"
985662,grimsbylander,2016-11-10 16:41:00,3016,I haven't been up there in years. I heard the trough is great once they start staging. Any one else hooking up on fish?
985664,RangerGuy,2016-11-10 16:49:00,564,"Ya that's where all the boats were congregating, I saw 2 eye's caught, but marked nothing. So I don't know if they have already moved out of there or haven't showed yet.. my guess is they haven't showed yet. I was reading a temp of 47 all day so they should be starting I would think."
985665,grimsbylander,2016-11-10 17:24:00,3016,I agree...I would bet it hasn't happened yet. Good luck and we'll wait for the pics!
