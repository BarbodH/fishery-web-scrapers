However Cliff is after 'more' than a basic set up from the looks of it.  Also, where he and I live it's a bit more than that then you need a HUGE tower to get the best signal ($$for the tower).  Hence why I offered him to bring me his old laptop (if he still has it) to format the drive and start with a fresh OS and new version of kodi so he can tinker and play it day by day after the fact."
985062,Big Cliff,2016-11-02 09:54:00,6899,"Thanks for all the replies and info.  CTC had digital antennas on about a month ago, bought one, hooked it up couldn't get even one channel. I read the instructions and it said ""must be within 25 miles of a transmitter"". Took it back.  Geoff, that old laptop I had; well I still have it, it's a little slow but so am I these days. Some of the programs I have on it I can't replace so I'll just keep using it. I do really appreciate your offer though!  We don't watch a lot of TV, we like to watch the news in the evening, there is a couple of series that we enjoy, Quantico, Lethal Weapon, The Blacklist.... For the most part I just download those the next day and we watch them when we want and that is free.  The reason I am interested in an alternative to cable is that I resent paying for channels that I never use and having to pay extra for the ones I do like to watch from time to time; Discovery, History........  Anyway I think my question has been answered; there is no simple plug and play box out there that will replace my cable without me having to run wires and cables, learn new technology, and save me a lot of money."

985160,Mister G,2016-11-03 23:04:00,1429,"Yep.. good old antenna.. but of the digital kind today. When Jen was in Mt Sinai, for weeks at a time, we just carried in her little flat screen and stuck an antenna in her room window. Pinged off probably 35 channels from the CN tower! There is actually no digital antenna to speak of. Rather then having main channels on VHF and sub channels being on UHV like years ago, almost all programming is now on UHF so actually is a better picture but not as strong signal as what we are use to on the VHF side of frequencies. Thus, any antenna will get you the proper reception, however because it's not as strong as years ago, you need a antenna properly aimed if you are far away from the station you are trying to draw in. I use two antennas (pointed in different directions)  combined on the roof and then one G-6 coax cable running into the house where it's connected to a amplifier and then to several TV's and a Tivo unit to boot.  But if you are close by to your broadcast tower, a simple antenna of any kind will work for the time being. However, you will be limited on how many channels you have to choose from.  It's FREE reception and it don't get no better then this."

984860,adempsey,2016-10-30 21:33:00,1498,"A lot of those boxes are a rip off.   They all rely on Kodi, which is a free app.   Eventually it's just going to get killed because of the mass appeal and use.    However, it's still going strong for now and as far as I know is legal for the most part [some add-ons function using peer-to-peer sharing which is illegal].  Basically, what Kodi is is software that you install onto your computer or media box in which you have to install add-on packages into.   Think of the add-on packages as things like TV channels or even a cable package.    They have things like FoodTV as an add-on that link to a variety of pre-recorded Food TV shows; or others like 1Channel that link to a huge variety of pre-recorded TV shows and movies.   None of those are live TV, but there are also add-ons you can install into Kodi that provide Live TV programming as well.  I don't watch LIve TV so not sure how good they are.   There are 100's of add-ons you can get.  It's almost like having Cogeco, Rogers and Shaw on your TV and you just choose what show you want to watch from within those selections.  As mentioned, it's not as easy to use as normal cable.   Things often don't work and sometimes the add-ons just stop working completely.  It's not the best for the non-techy, but it's not horrible either.  To set it up all you need is any computer or device with an HDMI out that runs Android, Linux, iOS or Windows.   I use an old computer running Windows for mine.   The Raspberry Pi is a good choice.  Some of the Android media boxes are decent too, but no way would I pay more than $100 for one."
