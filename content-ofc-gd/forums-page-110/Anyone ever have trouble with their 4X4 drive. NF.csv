985208,jimmer,2016-11-04 17:36:00,2730,It seemed to be holding strong Dan. I am going to run a few other tests over the weekend. It's just strange that I have never heard any grinding or clunking.
985225,ecmilley,2016-11-05 00:30:00,2163,Sorry bud been busy.  Fixed.piles of these including my own. First of all push button auto 4 wd? No messages on cluster to service 4 wd? WHEN u push 4 wd button does it keep flashing then go back to 2wd? IF yes u need a encoder motor. Auto 4 wd transfer case uses a automatic transmission style drum with clutch pack encoder motor acts.on a.clutch fork applying drum and also moves a synchro sleeve to engage planetary for chain when it gets weak it will partially engage shaft ant it will rotate when.elevated but won't transmit enough torque to do anything. The only other thing that.comes.to mind with this is front diff leaks. Low oil can cause tough engagement of actuator Also on gMc have seen front pinion gear sheared off in case from low oil conditions
986148,jimmer,2016-11-14 14:47:00,2730,"I PM'd you ecmilley.  So the update is that I lifted the truck up off the ground and ran it through the 4X4 stages and all engaged and all wheels turned.  I couldn't stop the front wheels when I tried.  The font wheels are spinning faster than the rear wheels when in 4X4, not sure if that is normal.  Still no 4X4 when all 4 wheels are on the ground."
985075,jimmer,2016-11-02 16:13:00,2730,"I have a 2004 Silverado 1500.  I lost my 4x4 this fall and it has me stumped. I hear the motor shift the transfer case.  The front drive shaft doesn't turn in 2wd, but will turn in 4wd, but no turning of the front wheels.  I changed out the axle actuator with one from the wreckers to see if that's what the problem was. No luck. Has anyone had this experience and found a solution? My next step is to try the actuator outside of the axle to see if the plunger is working. Maybe wiring??? Any tips or hints would be appreciated. Thanks,"

985083,jimmer,2016-11-02 17:21:00,2730,"Trying to find the location of the fuse is another thing Tom. But yes, I thought of that. I appreciate your suggestion. Thanks,"

985085,jimmer,2016-11-02 18:44:00,2730,"That's what I thought Dara, but nothing that simple as to say front axle actuator.  Must be listed under something else.  I googled it and that didn't help me either."

985101,Raf,2016-11-02 22:32:00,3495,i so miss the manual transfer case in my old jeep.  not much can go wrong.  yank the handle and you're in 4wd.  a freaking software recall had 4LO in-operable for months before chrysler fixed the 'fix' in my grand cherokee.
985108,ecmilley,2016-11-03 02:27:00,2163,The fuses are in under hood fuse box
985109,ecmilley,2016-11-03 02:28:00,2163,And yes I know all about that issue
985111,irishfield,2016-11-03 02:58:00,26272,At least you have 2 wheel drive! I'm running my F150 in 4Hi right now thanks to Fords wonderful vacuum actuated hub engagement... that won't fully disengage for 2 wheel drive and it makes that expensive grinding sound....
985116,jimmer,2016-11-03 13:16:00,2730,"The fuses are in under hood fuse box I just can't figure out which one it is though, the manual isn't very clear on identifying some of the fuses. Thanks for everyone's suggestions,"
985117,Terry,2016-11-03 13:21:00,14456,try fuse to check marked FRT AX in under hood fuse box.
985118,jimmer,2016-11-03 13:30:00,2730,Might help   Interesting and good info to know. I think my issue is a little different though.  I'm not getting any warnings to fix 4x4 or codes coming up. I hear the transfer case motor shifting and my front drive shaft will turn when I shift into one of the 4WD positions that's why I thought it was the axle lock.
985119,jimmer,2016-11-03 13:31:00,2730,try fuse to check marked FRT AX in under hood fuse box. I will Thanks!
985120,jimmer,2016-11-03 13:42:00,2730,try fuse to check marked FRT AX in under hood fuse box. This is the fuse panel under the hood and I don't see one named FRT AX or I'm blind.https://www.google.ca/search?q=image+2004+silverado+fuses&biw=1280&bih=907&tbm=isch&imgil=mODMa1txrDOiyM%253A%253BuomxHtrGxPsUqM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.gridgit.com%25252Fpost_chevy-fuse-block-diagram_361386%25252F&source=iu&pf=m&fir=mODMa1txrDOiyM%253A%252CuomxHtrGxPsUqM%252C_&usg=__tDbo8SMapIIiY5ivXwnt4BHGR9s%3D&ved=0ahUKEwjyhuT-2YzQAhVG9GMKHQWxBRIQyjcIKA&ei=BT0bWLLwDcbojwOF4paQAQ#imgrc=TIRyZ3Scq_bgiM%3A https://www.google.ca/search?q=image+2004+silverado+fuses&biw=1280&bih=907&tbm=isch&imgil=mODMa1txrDOiyM%253A%253BuomxHtrGxPsUqM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.gridgit.com%25252Fpost_chevy-fuse-block-diagram_361386%25252F&source=iu&pf=m&fir=mODMa1txrDOiyM%253A%252CuomxHtrGxPsUqM%252C_&usg=__tDbo8SMapIIiY5ivXwnt4BHGR9s%3D&ved=0ahUKEwjyhuT-2YzQAhVG9GMKHQWxBRIQyjcIKA&ei=BT0bWLLwDcbojwOF4paQAQ#imgrc=TIRyZ3Scq_bgiM%3A
985123,Terry,2016-11-03 15:17:00,14456,well when in doubt pick up some fuses and start changing them change some test then use the ones you took out and change some more and repeat
985124,DanD,2016-11-03 15:20:00,2223,"With you saying that the front driveshaft engages, when put into 4X4 the problem is not at the T case. To check if this is or is not an internal front differential (mechanical) issue. Remove the axle lock actuator solenoid, you should see a plunger in the hole where the actuator was. With the front wheels off the ground, have a helper rotate the front driveshaft, while you push in on that plunger; if all is good the axles should lock in. Here's a Vid that at 3:39 and at 7:00 minutes, shows you that plunger assembly.    Here are three wiring diagrams that may help you figure it out electrically? Without being there to see and analyze pin tests, voltage readings and scanner data; it would be hard to diagnose; at my keyboard.    Have a look at the top right corner of fig. 2, there's a 15 amp fuse in the under dash (IP) fuse panel.      Here the location of the 15 amp fuse in the left under dash fuse panel.    Hope This helps you a bit?  Dan."

985163,irishfield,2016-11-03 23:21:00,26272,"You'd think they'd get it right after 10 model years. Effects '04 to '12 apparently. I'll be fixing it myself, hopefully not needing the ""vacuum clutch""  but if so I've found it for $125US for the one side that's acting up.  I thought my hub had failed and then realized it wasn't a ball bearing sound but a gear mesh grind like my sister trying to drive standard. Scary part is you can't hear it if windows are up and radio is on at any volume. Thankfully I had the window down heading for the gate."
985171,dave524,2016-11-04 00:46:00,4508,"yikes, glad I got the old school  2hi-4hi-N-4lo shifter ahead of the emergency brake on the Jeep console."

985196,jimmer,2016-11-04 13:09:00,2730,"So I pulled the axle actuator again and put it in 4x4 when it was out of the diff.  It's working, so on to the next step and seeing if the front diff is the problem as DanD said."
985199,DanD,2016-11-04 13:31:00,2223,"When the actuator extended, did you try and push it back by hand; you might be able to but it should take a lot of force. The actuator needs enough strength to push the diff plunger in and hold it there.  Dan  PS I'll try and get the two missing wiring diagrams back up, when photobucket comes back on-line."
