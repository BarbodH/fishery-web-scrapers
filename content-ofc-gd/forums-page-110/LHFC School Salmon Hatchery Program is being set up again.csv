Still looking for help & will do a post when all the schools are set up, Komoka, London & Chesley are definately new for me with another new one in Sarnia & 2 different ones in Owen Sound, still working on 2 in Milton, 1 in Collingwood & another 1 in Guelph.Thanx & Tight Lines SBK http://lhfcschoolhatcheries.blogspot.ca/2016/11/school-salmon-hatchery-program-is.html"
