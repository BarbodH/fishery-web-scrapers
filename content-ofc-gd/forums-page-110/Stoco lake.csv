The muskie in the kawarthas are fun and plentiful but i havent got anything over 40"". Just wondering if anyone knows some spots, lures and locations on stoco and could give me a bit of help. Thanks in advance!  Peter"

We fished parallel to anywhere we could find pads and dollar lilies. Used jerkbaits and did well 5 fish for two days. Biggest was mid forties. Did see one fish of 50. The Island right out from the launch was the most productive, outside side."
