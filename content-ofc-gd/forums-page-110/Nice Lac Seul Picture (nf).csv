Sick photo Simon!!!Its not often lac seul is glass!Was this yesterday? Talk about a nice day hey bud? +21 here and not a lick of windSupposed to be warmer today even.Im heading out soon for a fish   Yeah, weather has been crazy warm, I was in my T-shirt all afternoon, even when the boat was moving. That was yesterday afternoon, like you said today is even warmer! Tbay was apparently +25C yesterday!!!!  Was an awesome afternoon out on 'Secret Island' as Jack calls it. We cooked smokies on an open fire, went exploring, hid a geocache there, shot tin cans with a BB gun, spent an hour in the boat and got 3 grouse on the way out.                               "
