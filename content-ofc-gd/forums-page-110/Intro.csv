Got some pointers from a few folks on another forum who I think are also on this forum. I plan on doing quite a bit of fishing next spring and summer on Sturgeon. I don't have a cottage, I am retired so I do a lot of day trips and rent cottage the odd time."

One of the 3 best things I did in my life besides finding my true love and retiring, not necessarily in that order. I'm kidding of course, the best was buying my StarCraft. I am going to change my password now. Don't you dare rat me out M2B2."
