There are plenty of opponents of nuclear, solar, wind.(The NIMBY's in our area are putting up a vigorous fight against wind). Our best hope might be to have millions of hampsters on treadmills being fed corn."

Our best hope might be to have millions of hampsters on treadmills being fed corn. But that bold part of your statement would be incredibly inefficient. The hamsters wouldn't be able to convert anywhere near the food energy input into energy output to the wheels, and the cost and energy required to produce the corn would be prohibitive  As for the NIMBY's, maybe if Trump continues to oppose turbines (or windmills, as he calls them) maybe more people will come around to them just to spite him.  I think the more green energy, renewables and carbon neutral power sources like nuclear are out there and the misinformation surrounding them is vetted and disposed of the more people will become accepting of them. We need to move away from fossil fuels and of course it isn't going to happen tomorrow, but someday soon, and maybe sooner than you realize."

Everything comes at a cost ... spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools and then moved to offsite storage sites... how long is the radioactive decay last ? Burning charcoal , gasoline and oil isn't going to help the planet either . Interesting documentary on NatGeo channel about how the US utility commissions lobby congressman and Senators to stop funding Solar , they have never had to deal with competition of any sort so they don't know what to do , and the politicians get monetary support to not help solar companies."

986180,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-14 21:10:00,8243,"I listened to a very good 900 CHML radio techie program last week where the electric car was discussed. It should be available on line.  For a 100 kilometer trip a Tesla as well as the GM Volt will cost an owner around 3 kilowatt hrs of electricity plus delivery charges to a residential home to make the trip and the range was 100 KM with a full charge. What I got from it is it isn't any less expensive to run a car on Hydro than it is for traditional fuel.  Add in the greater cost for a vehicle, cost to have your home wired to charge it, the cost of system maintenance and very expensive battery replacement as well as the limited numbers of those trained to maintain them add in the lack of charging stations an electric car is a very long way off from us seeing them in a neighbours driveway. It is a ""look at me I'm Green"" status symbol for the rich and famous. I am all in for being Green but it isn't in my budget for a small uncomfortable car that will never tow my boat. Certainly a long, long way from being a Rural transportation solution."

Certainly a long, long way from being a Rural transportation solution. At some point it will be more economical for some to install solar panels on their house and reduce fossil fuel costs for both their car and heating. It will start in cities and with those can afford to pay up front to save long term."

986206,Fishwilly,2016-11-15 00:35:00,206,Bottom line is the cost for any/all energy. Once the cost of solar comes down to the point that it's becomes a viable option ie: cheaper than other fuels and the technology becomes that much better....say goodbye to fossil fuels. This guy nailed it. Very interesting video.

What is going to fuel all the hydro generating plants, to supply the electricity until solar does hit what he calls the breaking point?

986273,Headhunter,2016-11-15 16:40:00,5703,"Those are good questions Dan, some that I thought of as well. What my take on the talk is, is that we are in such a fast moving/paced time, with technology these days, that there are potentially limitless options available to us today and obviously in the future. Sure, most of what he talks about is conjecture but based on scientific fact. It's a good time to be alive! HH"

986287,Headhunter,2016-11-15 18:31:00,5703,"For discussion purposes only, yes and no Dave. Much of what has traditionally held us back from innovation, has been a lack of desire to do so, by those who have held an interest in keeping things the way they are, specifically corporations. As we are now a global economy, those corporations don't have the monopolies that they historically had. That's why companies such as those in the automotive industry, have only recently, begun to invest in new technologies... to say nothing of the oil industry and they're influence around the world. GM has recently announced a centre for innovation to be built in Markham and I would be that they are not doing anything related to the internal combustion engine! HH"

Keep in mind that there is a lot of pollution associated with the oil industry (over an above the emissions during the end use).  So there would be some positive environmental changes associated with going to more electric."
986291,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-15 19:59:00,8243,The entire renewable energy movement is geared towards environmental protection. If there is money to be made doing this corporations will be more than happy to be onboard. Many years ago we were charging basically what was dirt with some Iron in it to make iron. The furnaces went for a dump. The then CEO asked me why? I told him we were trying to make Iron out of garbage. He said if we can make more money burning garbage we are now in the garbage business. Say what!!!
