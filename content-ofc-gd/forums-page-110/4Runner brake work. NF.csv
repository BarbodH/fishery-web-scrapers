However, overall the vehicles of today are SOOOO MUCH better with so much less required maintenance then back in the day. I guess some of you never had to ""Tune Up"" your car every 12000 miles or SOONER and engines last a LOT longer not to mention body panels that don't rust out in 2-3 years.  Today's Vehicles are: * Better * Stronger * Last Longer * Safer * More Comfortable * Cleaner for the Environment * And Cost a Lot More  And there is more to come in the future."

985580,captpierre,2016-11-09 21:37:00,2521,Just picked up my 2013 ride from dealer for routine service. Been a great vehicle so far. 78K km. Was told have 30-35 % brake pads left. Sliders seized and rusted. They want to do all 4 brakes. $1200 Does this sound right or am I being ripped? My GMC Safaris (3) that I've had got 100-110K Kms before brakes needed replacing. I drive conservatively. Mostly highway. Coast a lot to lights. Kinda disappointed. I did decline recommended bake servicing in the spring. Maybe that's why? Appreciate comments from you boys.

985598,huzzsaba,2016-11-09 23:10:00,884,"I would get a second opinion if you are concerned.  the whole package pads and rotors should not cost more than $600 for the good stuff.  labour maybe a few hours.  Personally If there is 35% left, i would replace them in the summer. buy the pads and sand the current rotors."

985602,irishfield,2016-11-09 23:34:00,26272,"If your sliders are seized then you'll only wear one side of the brake pads and rotors are probably toast. If they are really seized you may brake hard and go out of control. The rotors of today are throw aways anyhow.  Quickly hitting partsmonkey..  pads and rotors + some guide pin parts adds up to $630 and possibly another 80 bucks or so if you need all the rubber boots etc.  Shop rate is at or near $100 an hour and I'd say at least 4 hours there if your caliper pistons aren't seized. If they are, you're into more $'s for parts and labour.  One reason for calipers and such seizing is nobody really hits the brakes anymore and junk steel. I've always told my kids to get out on the road from time to time, look in the mirror and jam the pedal through the floor for a full lock up. It keeps things working and from seizing into the ""groves"" of light city driving."

985617,ecmilley,2016-11-10 01:43:00,2163,Not unusual for brakes to be worn at 80k if a slide pin seized wear on angle or.on one side. As for price seems ok if it's Toyota oem parts. With brakes.u get what u pay for and won't bother with most aftermarket rotors
985632,porkpie,2016-11-10 11:48:00,2521,"That's about average price for a 4 way brake job at a dealer, including new rotors.  Servicing your brakes will lengthen their life for sure.  I do mine when I change my tires seasonally, and once a year on my f150.  I generally spring for a new brake hardware kit once per year for both vehicles also, new clips etc."

Dealer quoted $2600.00 to install 4 new rotors, 4 sets of pads, & 1 front calliper that they say was seized.  I almost went for the repair but, declined as I wanted to get prices for the parts.  I called our local Napa dealer, was quoted $580.00 for their best rotors & pads.  I did the job myself in my driveway.  Yes it took 12 nhours of my time but I saved myself $2,000.00.  That Ford dealer will never see me again!  Oh & the front calliper was not seized.  BEWARE!!"
985643,porkpie,2016-11-10 13:48:00,2521,"Watch your fronts on the f150 and replace the brake clips yearly WD.  Mine have a tendency to bind in the clips and it will cause a slight drag on one pad if I don't service and replace the hardware often, it could be mistake for a seized or sticky slide pin.  Don't forget to clean out the rust and debris that forms below the clips on the caliper as well, that alone can cause poor performance.  Funny enough my rear brakes had 100k and never an issue until I changed em."

Good point Porkpie about checking the clips & other hardware. Thanx The trick sometimes when ordering from Rockauto.com especially if they are air filters OR cabin filters is to keep adding extra filters in the basket until the shipping increases. So for a rough example a cabin filter is $3 but shipping is $5.......add a few more cabin filters until the shipping goes up.......so many times you can get 3-4 filters shipped to you for the same amount as one filter.....and they don't have to be the same filters.
985667,captpierre,2016-11-10 17:52:00,2521,Thanks for that. I hardly ever lean on the brakes hard. So you are saying that is a good thing to do occasionally ? Until the antilock system kicks in?
