985217,Tjames09,2016-11-04 21:06:00,664,I have a Cardiff right now. but the drag is weak and the line pick up is slow. I should have done more research before buying it. I thought it was a musky reel but it's not really meant for it.

Revo Toro  First musky on my Lexa I bent the power handle on the hook set (my fault) but when I looked at it the handle is a terrible design  Revo is smoother... feels more sturdy...non disengaging line guide... clicker if you need it...

985244,lew,2016-11-05 14:43:00,12766,"Too bad you weren't looking for musky gear a couple months ago.  I just sold off everything I owned including some high end rods & reels, all the musky  tackle you'd ever use, a couple tackle boxes, a Frabil/Beckman musky net hybrid and everything in between.  Even tossed a 19' SKEETER deep V, tandem custom trailer & 150 Yammy into the mix  A few fellas on this board got some very nice deals."

Its an awesome reel, and it can do it all but comes with a higher price tag and only in RH retrieve. I have a lexa 400 now and after a few season of throwing baits its starting to go. Might get one more good season out of it. My brother has the Calcutta 400 and loves it, uses it for everything. I've heard good things about the Revo Toro S 61 and the Revo Toro Beast. I think it all depends on how much money you're willing to spend."

I ended up getting the beast to throw 10s as i know i cant get parts for the calcutta forever. The calcutta throws the 10s beautifully but the grind will wear it out over time. The beast also throws 10s quite nicely and i have thrown nothing but during a full day and still had some gas in the tank. i had my calcutta new on an old 6'6"" compre i bought used for $50, i put my money into the reel first and everything else later. Good luck with your purchase."

I toss smaller stuff with my Curado 300E, jerkbaits with an Abu Record 60, an Abu 7000i for double 10s and another Abu 7000 for trolling. It took me 3-4 years to accumulate but now I do not need anything other than the odd new bait or leaders and some new line. Buy good gear, it will last and take a lot of use and abuse, cheaper gear will always leave you wanting and always end up needing to be be replaced because it falls apart. Welcome to the musky fray. Have fun."

I was also turned off from the round reels after the Cardiff but I picked up the Calcutta after everyone was recommending it.  I use the Revo Toro s for blades only up to double 10's and it feels pretty sturdy when I'm reeling it but I find myself turning to the Calcutta to throw everything else and generally just enjoy using it more. I can also throw blades on the Calcutta but then I wouldn't use the Toro s at all."
985121,Tjames09,2016-11-03 14:46:00,664,"Looking at expanding my musky arsenal. These 3 reels all seem to be in the same category.  Id be looking at the 5:1 gear ratios in the Lexa and Toro, the Curado only comes in 6:1.  The Lexa has a short line retrieve of only 23"" in the 5;1; where the revo toro 60 has 29"" in the 5:1 gear. The Curado is also 28"", but using a higher gear of 6:1, could be harder on reeling in double 10's.   If i upsize the Lexa to the 400 it gets considerably heavier at 15oz, but line retrieve increases to 27"", but it'd be the heaviest reel out of the 3 options. the 400 would also have double the line capacity of the Curado at 200yards for 80lb braid.

Some people say Abu, some say Shimano, etc.  I think the main purpose of the rod will be throwing large inline spinners like 8s and 10s. It looks like Abu doesnt make the winch anymore, its not listed on there website, just the Toro S and the Toro Beast, but the beast is above my budget."

985188,Andy,2016-11-04 10:57:00,330,"First of all, a reel that can pull double 8s may not be at all suited for double 10s. I have a Curado, great reel, but use it mainly for small to medium  bucktails and spinnerbaits. I do not consider it well suited for extended double ten use. Wrong gear ratio. I personally don't enjoy pulling in double tens. It likely costs me fish, but I go as big as double 9s and use a Toro Nacl with a power handle and it works well. I think it depends on how often you fish double tens. If you want to use them all day long, I'd get at least a Calcutta B with a power handle, or save up for a Tranx. You want the lower gear ratio. If you like switching it up and want to use the reel for a few different lures, I'd try the Toro S  with the power handle.  If I were to take a liking to tossing the heavier stuff for extended periods of time, I'd get a Calcutta with power handle."
985205,Raf,2016-11-04 16:00:00,3495,"once you get into double 10s above, and you plan on fishing them hard, you almost need a specialized reel ie. tranx, 7000 abu, winch, beast or one of the saltwater non-levelwinds like the trinidad or avet reels  if you don't want to go that route, get a calcutta 400 series.  i use an avet sxj mc.  it is round but only about the size of a 6500 series abu.  the lack of a level wind is a non-issue for blade baits but you would not want to throw anything that requires slack line (ie. jerkbaits) or doesn't pull very hard.  in that sense, it's a one-trick-pony.  however, if you're throwing big blades 90% of the time anyway, what's the issue?"
