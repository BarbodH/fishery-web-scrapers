985532,Mister G,2016-11-09 15:13:00,1429, I read Trump's win as a complete and total rejection of everything Obama. BINGO ! ! !
985533,grimsbylander,2016-11-09 15:17:00,3016, And we did better by electing Trudeau?  I can't believe you seriously made the parallel between Trudeau and Trump. Quite the stretch in order to criticize.

This was a message that anyone willing to give the current state of politics the finger and ruffle the feathers of the status quo has a place in today's system. This can't be pinned solely on Obama or any other democrat. It's about change. This is a large scale version of Rob Ford. He portrayed the image of anything but a politician and that's just what TO wanted."

I'm sure if the Republicans had a less controversial candidate it would have been a real blowout.  I think the same may have been true for the Democratic candidate.      And we did better by electing Trudeau?  I think we did.  And I didn't vote for Trudeau.      You cancelled your membership to Steelhead Manifesto?
985564,T-Bone,2016-11-09 19:07:00,160,"I'm amazed this many of you have knowledge, and opinion, and seem to quite passionate about all of this. When Canada has an election, I'd bet there's only a handful of people in the US that have any idea of who is even running, or any knowledge of how the system works. I'd bet there is even less a chance that anyone cares.  Don't worry...as I've said before....Donald Trump won't be running the country. He'll certainly take credit for the successes and failures within his tenure though.  As an American, it was clear Hillary tried (and almost succeeded) to buy the election. And if I would have had to withstand four years of hearing her shrieking voice I would have surely moved to your side of the border.  Donald or Hillary...really doesn't matter much. Life here in the states rolls on...as it has for many, many presidential elections."

985566,Oggie,2016-11-09 19:27:00,588,Well I'm not a Trump fan but we agree on one thing ..... NAFTA wasn't good for the US or Canada despite what the CEO's tell you.  I think he'll stop the rhetoric and he might actually run the country with its citizens in mind.  Remember government don't run countries anymore corporations do.
985567,manitoubass2,2016-11-09 19:33:00,11391,NAFTA has always been a horrible thing.

985512,Sterling,2016-11-09 12:55:00,477,"""Media"" prediction was 270 to 170. Final results 218 to 279. Wonder who had the media in their pocket?  Like manitoubass said, Trump strikes me as an idiot in some ways, but it's remarkable how idiotic the democrats were this cycle. Screwing over my boy Bernie (whom had a better shot, by the way), mixed with tremendous in-party corruption. Serves them right.  Seems like the biggest force in Donald's favor was the DNC's corruption.  Next 4 years is going to be entertaining, to say the least."

985515,Mister G,2016-11-09 13:22:00,1429,Hillary didn't even come out to give a concession speech and to thank her supporters who worked so hard for her. It just goes to show she was just in it for herself and the heck with everyone else.  Trump's speech was very gracious even to Hillary and her family.  Already it looks like the best man won.  God Bless American and maybe Canada can take some clues from this movement.

It's after an term in office when history reveals whether the candidate was the right choice. Not after their acceptance speech. Let's save the hope's for Canada for the reality of what's to come. This election was about change and it was change at almost any cost. Donald Trump or Donald Duck...they wanted change and they got it. Here's hoping the gamble pays off.

Told them exactly what they wanted to hear. Make America great again! Apparently the people bought it. This from a man that has stiffed his country in so many ways for so many years.  It was my sincere hope that he would lose. He's the most arrogant narcissist of all time. Can't stand looking at the man. Much less listening to him."

985523,grimsbylander,2016-11-09 14:21:00,3016,Seems they clearly understand their priorities and what really matters when electing a new leader. The entire election was and is a joke...on the world stage no less. The American people deserved better choices than what they had...period. But the system that allowed it to come down to these two failed them. The results say more about the people than the winner and that would be true regardless of who won.
