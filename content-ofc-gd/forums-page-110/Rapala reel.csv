985497,SirCranksalot,2016-11-09 04:39:00,3291,Does this sound right? The Rapala R-Type spinning reel for nearlr $200.  Sounds a bit excessive.  https://rapala.ca/products/r-type-spinning
985525,mark demmery,2016-11-09 14:34:00,68,"Their prices on the website are really elevated.  I bought a bulk lot of fishing equipment that had a bunch of their ""seeker"" series reels.  good reels, but not worth the $150 they have them listed on the website for. Amazon has them for $99. I was selling them on kijiji for $70.  Not sure what the theory is, but i think their website prices are even higher than msrp???  https://rapala.ca/products/seeker-spinning"
985558,John Bacon,2016-11-09 18:37:00,3277,What do Stradics sell for these days?  I still use the ones that I bought 20 years ago.  They seem to be a popular choice for other members too.  I think I would be looking at a Stradic before I paid $200 for a Rapala.
