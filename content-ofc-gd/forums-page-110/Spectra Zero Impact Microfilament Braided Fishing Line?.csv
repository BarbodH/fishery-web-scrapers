986058,GBW,2016-11-14 00:23:00,8460,Hey all  Just wondering if anyone uses this line and likes it?  I was thinking about getting it in 20LB or 30LB for a baitcaster to either flip jigs or troll hardbody baits for walleye.  Thanks.  G
986059,GBW,2016-11-14 00:29:00,8460,Based on a video I found I don't think it's ideal to cast with on a baitcaster but might be amazing for trolling.  So if anyone uses it on a baitcaster please let me know.
