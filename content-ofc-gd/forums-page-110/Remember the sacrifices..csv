985170,grimsbylander,2016-11-04 00:42:00,3016,Good reminder. Remembrance Day is just around the corner.
985179,irishfield,2016-11-04 02:03:00,26272,Thanks Jimmer... will try to get my wife's pictures of her Grandfather as a cook in WW1 and then in WWII he hid Canadian soldiers in his lumber yard rafters( in Holland) from the Nazi's and Leah's then 4 year old father would take them out food in his bloomers right in front of the Germans. For now here is my brother shortly after the Gulf War. Served 20 years in CANFOR with over a decade as squadron commander on the Herc's out of Trenton. 
985194,jimmer,2016-11-04 12:57:00,2730,It's nice that they are continued to be honoured!  My father was stationed in Holland for a time during WWII.

985903,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-12 13:58:00,8243,We must remind ourselves the sacrifice of those that came before us as well as those that continue to make those sacrifices today. We must remember regularly not just this one day a year.
