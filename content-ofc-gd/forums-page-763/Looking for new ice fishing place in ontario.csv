We are looking for a new spot to visit. We would prefer to stay on the ice but are open to renting a cottage as long as there is transportation to and from the hut as we don't all have snowmobiles. Looking for something within 3+/- hours of Toronto (we are 1.5 hrs from TO). Any suggestions would be appreciated!"

As they get older.. like all of us they get lazier.. and the bungalo gets placed once and only once, in a spot for extraction convenience and not because it's on a good fishing spot."
403438,Jen,2009-11-18 14:52:00,833,"You could rent a cottage out in Dunnville on the lake, and then fish in the portable ice huts at fishmasters... If the fish are on it is a five minute walk out onto the ice and a cab ride back to your cottages after... just a suggestion... Contact Steve at Fishmasters if you want some other ideas..."

403461,jimmer,2009-11-18 15:56:00,2730,I haven't seen any confirmation about year round fishing in the kawarthas yet.  I live on Pigeon. Where did you hear this? It would only be panfish if it did open.
