I decided to stop and check it out.  I did see one guy fishing, by the train tracks, but he didn't have much luck.  I was wondering if anyone here has any experience fishing any stretches of the Welland River?  Is it any good, what kind of fish can be expected?  Just thought I might check it out since it is fairly close to my house."
