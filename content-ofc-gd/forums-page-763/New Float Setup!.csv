403711,[email protected],2009-11-19 03:50:00,290,"Thanks to BillM I now have my first float setup!  G. Loomis Centerpin Reel paired with a Raven IM6 13'6.  I met up with Bill at Bass Pro and he was kind enough to show me the right stuff to buy, and the stuff not to buy.  Showed me how to rig it up and taught me a bunch of stuff I had no clue about.  Then he showed me how to cast it a few times out in the parking lot.  Its always nice to meet good people from here who are willing to help a noob learn the ropes  Thanks again Bill and I hope to be posting a report tomorrow night!      EDIT: Here's some pics  Had to find my mini usb cable for my blackberry.            "
403712,johnnyb,2009-11-19 03:53:00,3413,Awesome stuff!!!     Nice to see the community workin' together
403714,irishfield,2009-11-19 03:56:00,26272,Damn good thing the border guard was quick with the cavity search tonight... or the place would have been closed before he got there!  
403717,Kinger,2009-11-19 03:57:00,351,"Nice, great to see stuff like this.  Now, lets see some pics man, gear pr0n!!!"
403727,[email protected],2009-11-19 04:44:00,290,  Updated with pics
403734,young_one,2009-11-19 05:03:00,620,"with all this new tackle, you should catch steelheads like no tomorrow! Good luck this weekend!"
403735,Kinger,2009-11-19 05:05:00,351,"Nice looking pin, is that a good starter pin? and how much was the reel if you don't mind?"
403738,[email protected],2009-11-19 05:15:00,290," Yeah its sexy  I think its a good starter/mid range reel. I didn't know too much about it , but its comparable to the Tournament Drifter methinks.  I've got all the right equipment now... and the proper setups...  So If I don't catch a steely now..... well.... . lol..."
403740,Beats,2009-11-19 05:41:00,543,"Very nice, enjoy."
403742,frozen-fire,2009-11-19 06:21:00,542,Nice. We are in similar stages of steelheading.  Keep at it. Takes a few trips to get it down.  Hopefully we hook into our firsts this weekend
403750,solopaddler,2009-11-19 12:18:00,8605," Bill is a good man, very glad to hear things worked out. Might be wise to not take any tips from him though. (Sry Billy low blow)     Funny 'cause it's kind of true."
403754,wallacio,2009-11-19 12:32:00,475, Don't kick the guy while he's down Mikey!!!!   Shake it off Bill...better days ahead!!!
403757,msp,2009-11-19 12:58:00,1336,Thats a great set up. Great reel too. You wont have to upgrade for a long time......or ever! Im pretty sure that reel is made by Drifter.
403782,[email protected],2009-11-19 14:28:00,290, Yeah I think its comparable to the Tournament Drifter.
403784,drwxr,2009-11-19 14:32:00,453,looks good
403840,BillM,2009-11-19 18:01:00,17367," Yeah, I took an asskicking for sure yesterday...  Jayson, remember what I told you about lead length.  No matter what bait you use, if it's not in the zone, you won't catch a thing.  Good luck man!  That first fish will be a riot!"
403848,solopaddler,2009-11-19 18:18:00,8605, Just yesterday?
403851,irishfield,2009-11-19 18:19:00,26272, We're talking about the border guard here right...
403853,BillM,2009-11-19 18:25:00,17367, Bad mojo man the past few trips... I dunno what to tell you!!    I'll bring some dynamite along on Sat just incase.
403861,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-19 18:33:00,0,"sometimes dry spells are followed by an opening of the floodgates!  i'll cross my fingers for you bill.   i wouldn't feel bad though...i had a friend that it took 3 straight skunkings on trips but he finally ended the curse this weekend past.  makes the ones you get even better, especially if they are big!"
403949,ehg,2009-11-19 22:44:00,2666,"Now that you have a decent float setup, you need to be where the fish are. Most folks go to New York state since the Great Lake tributaries are heavily stocked with fall running bows. You are already off to a great start with that rod and reel."
403959,solopaddler,2009-11-19 23:09:00,8605," Or Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Huron and Georgian Bay in ON."
403962,danjang,2009-11-19 23:12:00,148,Thats a mighty fine reel for someone who hasn't caught a steelie yet! . I recently caught my first after trying since last opener till most of the fall. Never be discouraged because the payoff is awesome! I've never been to any western tribs but some of the eastern tribs are just really pleasant to fish regardless of being skunked or not. I've had pools all to myself on the weekends most of the time.
