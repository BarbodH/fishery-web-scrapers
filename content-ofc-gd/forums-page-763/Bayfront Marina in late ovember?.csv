403516,justwannafish,2009-11-18 18:21:00,82,I'd like to be able to get in a few more days of fishing before the ice comes in and was wondering if it's worth it to hit up the Bayfront Marina or Hamilton Harbour this time of year. I've heard jigging spoons will work in colder water but I'm not sure if they'll do the trick from shore and I dont' have a boat to get out on the water. Does anyone have any advice as to where to go and what to use in the Hamilton or surrounding area?
403522,basskicker09,2009-11-18 18:34:00,144,i know they are catching pike at la salle marina right now in hamilton seen a couple posts on the niagara board using big minnows under a float hope this helps some
403525,justwannafish,2009-11-18 18:40:00,82,  I'll give it a whirl Thanks!
403532,basskicker09,2009-11-18 19:04:00,144,no problem

403573,basskicker09,2009-11-18 21:32:00,144,to much time and effort to catch a couple fish ill stick with pike and other easy to catch fish lol
403575,[email protected],2009-11-18 21:43:00,290, But its much more rewarding
403578,basskicker09,2009-11-18 21:56:00,144,oh i know i use to chase the trout all winter but now i prefer to fish for pike and perch from shore and through the ice sometimes we even get a bow throught the ice now thats fun lol
403705,justwannafish,2009-11-19 03:24:00,82," Hey man  You still fishin the harbour and marina this time of year? I remember you sayin you caught your salmon under the lift bridge but now that that's over, what do you fish for when you're not chasin the steelers?"
