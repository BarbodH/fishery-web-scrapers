403765,aniceguy,2009-11-19 13:26:00,1094,good episode last night...I loved that he was showcasing a locally avaliable non mass produced Jig in the OSP Another good show that teaches exactly how to fish a dock.  I dont see ANY other show that a host is willing to give the detailed information he is giving.!!! Well worth the watching in my opinion
