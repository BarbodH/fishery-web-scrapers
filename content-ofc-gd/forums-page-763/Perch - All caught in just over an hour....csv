After a morning of helping Steve Shrink Wrap a huge boat we decided to grab a couple of hours fishing before our dinner party... Everyone was to arrive just after dark... Got on the water by 2:00, a 20 min boat ride and we were there, on the fish...          It was the most beautiful day, as soon as our rigs hit bottom we started catching fish... non stop... Till close to sunset when we had to call it a day...  Get out there and fish guys, there are some amazing fish to be caught!"
