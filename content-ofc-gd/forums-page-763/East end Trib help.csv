Tomorrow afternoon im going to be bringing my father-in-law out for some float fishing.  this is his first time and i would like to get him into a fish.  We tried fly fishing this spring with little success.  I was out from about 330-5pm tonight and the water looked good  (Duffins).  I didn't have any hits but so long as it doesn't rain too hard tonight i think the conditions will be good tomorrow.   I am off tomorrow and am going to be trying various spots during the day if anyone wants to come out with me that knows a couple spots i would love some company.  I am going to try to pre-fish as much as possible as we will only have about two hours of daylight by the time he gets off work.  If anyone wants to join me i will gladly drive.  i would like to keep it withing ~30min's of pickering.  Send me a PM if you want to get together or just help me out with a couple spots to try.  Thanks,  AA."
