I know I post alot of these threads but they help myself, and I'm pretty sure they also help alot of other people with the common steelheading questions.  I've got the night free and trying to figure out where I want to go.  It's raining lightly outside right now, and I think the rain is supposed to continue for most of the afternoon.  My original idea was going back to my spot at the Caledonia Dam, but I've heard that it won't be good today, but tomorrow/the rest of the weekend.  Feel free to PM me any good creeks  lol.  Thanks"
