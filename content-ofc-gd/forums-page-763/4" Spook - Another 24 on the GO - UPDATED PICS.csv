403009,Leecher,2009-11-17 03:27:00,7832," OK Bill, let me see what I can do about reducing the size and adding ball bearings to it. Another question:  do they have 2 sets of treble on the JR's??"
403010,BillM,2009-11-17 03:30:00,17367," Yup, 2 sets of trebles... just like the fullsize."
403012,fishinguypat,2009-11-17 03:36:00,547,Leechman you should try makin these with the wood handle from a broom stick? cut it to size and form into the right shape?
403013,Leecher,2009-11-17 03:43:00,7832, That's a good idea fishinguypat!!!  But you have to remember that broom stick is a hard wood compared to pine and will be hard to sand.  Also will take the fun out making my own from scratch
403044,BassAsin,2009-11-17 04:57:00,806,"c'est beau,   looks good jaques you just keep making them and when ya have no place to store them send them this way hahah."
403120,Lunker777,2009-11-17 16:59:00,866,Looks good !!! Why not try Balsa ?
403186,Governator,2009-11-17 21:15:00,879,"Are batteries not included?      Kidding!  Those look brilliant, have you tried making them in different sizes?"
403220,Leecher,2009-11-17 22:37:00,7832," Thanks Matt!!!  I have a brand new Plano tackle box that's just waiting to be filled with them lures.... if I ran out of space.... I'll keep you in mind   Thanks Lunker777!!!  I checked Balsa on Google cause I didn't know what it was and seemed to be the same as Bass wood, softwood.... it's another possibility for future projects   Batteries not included Thanks Governator!!!  So far I've made 5's and 4's.... next on the menu is 3's with rattles Jacques"
403228,fishinguypat,2009-11-17 23:11:00,547, yeah... i've heard of people using broom stick handles maybe there are cheapo ones with softer wood? you should try it some day
403232,Terry,2009-11-17 23:28:00,14456,MAN they are looking good
403261,Leecher,2009-11-18 00:21:00,7832, I'll certainly give them a go if I find softer ones for sure!!!   Thanks Terry!!!  Real proud of those ones
403279,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-18 01:00:00,2038,Speaking of BallBearings.....  I have some 1/4 inch stainless steal ones = Perfect size for ZaraSpooks   
403282,Leecher,2009-11-18 01:03:00,7832, Cool Paul   May be I can use some of those in exchange for a rattling one
402060,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-14 00:39:00,709,50$ a piece!  ill take 5 for that price.  WHAT A DEAL!
402067,Leecher,2009-11-14 01:01:00,7832," Thanks vinnimon!!!  5buckx5 bucks is $25.... you may have a deal I know it ain't worth selling for the amount of time put in.... The jointed spook is one of it's kind..... was going to test it this fall but deer season got in the way.  I plan on testing it next softwater season in June, when bass & pike are opened.  There is some modifications I have to make to it (and this is from the great recommendations from the good folks of this board)  but until then, it just have to wait.  Hope I don't disappoint you but it is what it is. Jacques"
402068,Leecher,2009-11-14 01:02:00,7832, Thanks Kev!!!  It's a deal
402070,Twocoda,2009-11-14 01:15:00,4130,i buy one..... maka carbon copy yeah??? sell for 5 dolla ...who pay 5 dolla ..  kinda reminds me of the story about the newfie that opened up an adult store ...white woman comes in and buys a big black one for 100 bucks ..black woman comes in and buys a white one for 100 bucks....female wearwolf comes in and buys his stainless steel thermos for 300 bucks
402074,vinnimon,2009-11-14 01:26:00,2593,there was no x between  5bucks5bucks  .Ill buy 2 jointed ones for 25.
402078,Leecher,2009-11-14 01:31:00,7832," Nice try but no deal Once the testing is done, I'll most likely make modifications to it and then build another one.... it all depends on the results Jacques"
402080,Leecher,2009-11-14 01:32:00,7832, COOL Twocoda    My my my.... $100     it's a deal
402083,Twocoda,2009-11-14 01:45:00,4130,i wouldnt even know how to use a spook Jacques

402099,Leecher,2009-11-14 02:53:00,7832, Yes Bill I made a couple of them.... it was previously posted at the following address:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=37335&hl=  Top water rules!!!  Jacques
402103,snag,2009-11-14 03:04:00,1932,Here you are with your first prototype:  ***PIC DENIED***
402115,Leecher,2009-11-14 03:27:00,7832, Hey Grant..... I checked and it wasn't there     What next???
402118,snag,2009-11-14 03:36:00,1932,Sorry Jacques!  I was bamboozled!  It was a pic of a guy lying on the floor knocked out by his own nun chucks!   Good job buddy!  Don't you be giving those away for nothing!   
402121,Leecher,2009-11-14 03:42:00,7832, No problem Grant.... Thanks  Noted
402151,Greencoachdog,2009-11-14 13:29:00,8163,"Well I recieved a limited edition Signature Series Leechman Spook in the mail a couple days ago and was very impressed!!!  These things are a labor of love and a work of art let me tell ya!!!  It arrived in it's own handmade shipping crate!    Even the shipping crate was signed!!!    When I opened it up, my eyes fell upon a thing of beauty!!!    I can hardly wait for the water to warm up next spring so I can catch a fish with it... but I'm going to try it out the next time I'm on the water, even if I don't catch a fish!  Thanks a million Bubba Jacques ol' buddy!!!.. I owe you one!!!"
402200,Leecher,2009-11-14 20:04:00,7832," Glen your welcome my friend and I'm glad you finally got it....  I couldn't find any containers to ship it in so I had to create one out of pine..... and by the looks of it, kept it in one piece.... it's in the same position it was when I packaged it up  Hope you catch a biggun with it!!! Jacques"
402994,Leecher,2009-11-17 03:05:00,7832,Here's an update on the color patterns    other side    Leechman
402995,BillM,2009-11-17 03:07:00,17367,"Jacques, I think the Zara Spook Jr is probabl my fav topwater bait of all time.  You make anything similar?  I'd love to get a few of them a test drive!!!"
403000,Leecher,2009-11-17 03:16:00,7832," Bill, how long are the JR's??  in the pics there's 4's and 5's I can make 3"" ones no problems    if that's what you are looking for Jacques"
403001,ctdd2006,2009-11-17 03:18:00,531,Congrats on fine work.  Such a compliment from GCD too!!!?  I'm lucky enough to be the proud owner of some of his jigs and if he's impressed I'm impressed!  Cheers.  Keep up the great work.
403002,BillM,2009-11-17 03:19:00,17367," I'd have to measure for sure, but I would assume around the 3inch range.  I think the kicker with the Jr's is that they have rattles, compared to the pups and the normal sized ones which don't..  Rattles = fish!"
403005,Leecher,2009-11-17 03:23:00,7832, Thanks ctdd!!!  Yes his jigs are a thing of beauty and art.  I'm also the proud owner of his awesome work.  That is why I shipped him one of my spooks as a thank you gift.  Jacques

401584,kickingfrog,2009-11-12 03:22:00,8333, You would be.
401754,mbac31,2009-11-12 20:24:00,904,"Does your wife know that you cut up her Broom.  Great looking baits, just a note. On the jointed one i would taper the back peice in the front as not to hang up to much. Gives it a better action and a smother bait will not hang up in stuff."
401764,highdrifter,2009-11-12 21:15:00,2534,Soo...  It doesn't come in sexy shad???!!
401819,fishinguypat,2009-11-13 00:08:00,547,Kevin Van Dam would be proud...until you make it in sexy shad....
