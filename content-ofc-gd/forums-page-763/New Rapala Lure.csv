403172,steverowbotham,2009-11-17 20:11:00,1800,it's balsa so it will float pretty quick when doing that.  I think it's a better trolling bait than anything
403178,Garry2Rs,2009-11-17 20:49:00,1425,"The new DT9 is a casting bait, as opposed to the new trolling baits which Rapala also introduced at I-Cast this year.  This flat-sided bait is called DT9 because DT stands for ""Dives To"" and it runs 9 feet deep.  It fits in the the Rapala line-up along with the older Flat DT3 and DT7. These flat body baits have a tighter wobble than the round bodied DT series.  Those who have used the new DT9 Flat Rap say that although it has a balsa wood body,  it has what they call a ""slow rising characteristic."" Therefore, I think that a stop and go retrieve should work okay.  However, please note that the coffin shaped bill is designed to deflect off of wood and rocks and bounce off the bottom at odd angles to trigger strikes.  That would indicate that, at least around cover, a steady retrieve might work just as well. Garry2R's"
