402671,LucG,2009-11-16 15:17:00,779,"Hello Everyone,  I just got back from a week off work that was spent trapping and hunting. I must say, I couldnt have picked a better week. Allthough it wasnt as cold as I wanted it to be for hunting, but it sure was nice for trapping.  My week started off Saturday morning, I decided to use the sunny morning to my advantage and get out and set some traps. I remebered to bring the camera, but since I was by myself, I rarely remebered to take it out. Here's a shot of a nice big beaver pond. That's their house on the bottom.    The next morning after sitting in my tree stand unsuccessfully, I decided to head out and check my beaver traps that I had set the day before, as well as set a few marten traps at the same time. Sure enough, I had a nice load of fur.  Here is the first beaver I caught, same location as the pic above.    7 beavers on a one night soak, I couldnt believe it!    This is where I spent most of my week off. I put so much effort into a little roof, and it didnt rain on me at all this year!    After checking my traps sunday, I let them sit for at least two days in between checks. My cousin really got into it last year, so I suggested he come down for a few days, I think he showed up 30 min after our conversation. This is what my second outting produced.  A nice marten.    The day's catch. Another 6 beaver, 3 marten and two muskrats.    A record size beaver (for me) It measured 45"" long, and must have weight at least 45 lbs.     Here are a few other pics throughout the week.  Frosty beaver on a frosty morning    Cousin Rob with a beaver.    Scenes for the trapline. A beaver dam, their feed bed (pile of branches in the middle of pond) and their house, all the way at the back.    All those beaver have to be skinned, at about 35-45 min per beaver, you do the math.    FINALLY, two days before deer closed, after sitting in a treestand for countless hours, all week long, it finally paid off. We had 3 tags to fill, two does and a buck, and I was given permission to FILL EM!!  So I did!  The perfect way to finishg off my week. A nice doe, and a decent sized fawn.     I had an amazing time, a week in the Bahamas couldnt have been better.  Hope you enjoyed the pics!  LucG"

402695,LucG,2009-11-16 15:54:00,779," Well I usually sell them at auction, but since the prices are going to be low this year, I was thinking of keeping a few. Not sure about a fur coat, but a nice hat or pair of mits would be nice. Keep me warm for when we can get out ice fishing!"

403520,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-18 18:31:00,0,"Another impressive report. Looks like you will be eating well and got some extra Christmas money. I know you were saying that they sell for $50 a fur, but I didnt know you have to skin it. I thought you just gave them the entire beaver! Looks like alot of work, but like was said.  Its an honest living and the fact that you enjoy it makes it all the more sweeter. Thanks for sharing."
