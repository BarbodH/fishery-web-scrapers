403144,Uncle Buck,2009-11-17 18:19:00,1000,"I bought a new trolling motor.  Minn Kota All Terrain - Cable Steer, Scissor Mount  I had an older unit mounted to the bow, but upgraded the thrust/voltage  Issue I had with the previous motor i mounted was  i had to Orient the motor head/prop the right way so it wouldn't hit my rail...  looking at it, unless i let it overhand the edge, i'll be having the same problem with this unit...  Both units old and new were/are Minn Kota All terrains  I'd rather be able to just pull the cord up and not worry which way the motor is oriented...  any ideas?"
403146,bubbles,2009-11-17 18:22:00,591,"Mine overhangs, have to be sure it is orientated properly for the cover to fit properly as well.  I think it is the only way."
403157,River Rat,2009-11-17 18:53:00,161,I've mounted two both with overhangs...no problems with either.  Cheers  RR
403401,Jer,2009-11-18 12:42:00,1426,It just becomes habit to step on the pedal as you lift to set the motor the right way.
403724,Rattletrap2,2009-11-19 04:24:00,1652,"Yeah, I agree with Jer. It does become second nature to step on the pedal and orientate the motor with the prop facing in. I don't think there is any way other to do it. I like the slide off mounts and remove mine to put the cover on. Problem with that is.....it seems to get heavier every year! I have a Minn Kota Maxxum 65 and it is a bit of a beast to lug around these days."
