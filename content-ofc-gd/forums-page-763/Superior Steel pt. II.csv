402230,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-15 00:09:00,0,Lately I've been fishing the tribs a few times a week but never had more than a few hours including driving time... Today I had a full day so my leash was lengthened for the day.  I have had some successes this year but it has been a lot of smaller 1-3 lb fish. The tribs were REALLY low and clear in most cases so we guessed a river that might still produce. We apparently chose wisely.  River level slowly rose throughout the day... Colour remained gin clear. Missed some real good fish that I couldn't even turn in the big flows... Here's some pics I took of our rainy successes...  Early a.m. chrome   Releasing a chromedome   Nice chubby hen   Steel in the mist..   War vet.   Rosey Cheeks McGee   Thanks for reading!

402374,wallacio,2009-11-15 14:53:00,475,"Nice ones!   If you think that your leash is short now, wait until kids come along!!!"
402375,Kinger,2009-11-15 14:55:00,351,"hahah Mason! nice ones man, I need to go up with you one day this week."
402392,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-15 15:51:00,0,  I have a son.  He's WHY I have the leash. But I'm hoping that he will learn to love fishing early.

402656,Guidofisherman,2009-11-16 14:38:00,206,Nice steeliesand great report. I think I packed it in too soon.
402699,troutologist,2009-11-16 15:59:00,951,"Good job, it was undoubtably an early morning if you go up there at that time.  Nice fish. In the future when taking a picture of wing and a fish focus more on the fish, by more I mean all on the fish."
402750,anders,2009-11-16 18:43:00,1168,"Lucas,  Just checked out your blog...nice job! Looking forward to the site."
402756,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 19:02:00,0,it's coming along slow and steady. just working on purchasing an HD cam for video purposes...
402793,anders,2009-11-16 20:53:00,1168,lets just not divulge too much about the park...i dont want to have to revoke your privilages for this area
402800,troutologist,2009-11-16 21:00:00,951,"  Agreed, no names or signs...obatanga is too nice a park to have the fishing ruined."
402826,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 22:05:00,0,i have no locations in my reports...and most of my pictures have no background... and this has nothing to do with any parks; obatanga or otherwise.  i just don't like people knowing where i fish and there's only 4 or 5 people i ever divulge location details to.
