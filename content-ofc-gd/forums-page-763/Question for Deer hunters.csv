It is a beautiful still night sitting right on the 0 degree mark. I also heard some grunting or snorting noises coming from the same area as the other noises. I went inside for my q-beam and when I shone it across the yard, there were three beautiful Doe heading back into the bush from the river!  My question is this. Is the grunting sound a part of the rut? I have yet to see a Buck around here.  Okay, second question. Could this mean that there was a Buck out there close by?  Thanks for the help folks! I've obviously never hunted, but I am curious to learn more about these fascinating creatures!"
403344,ch312,2009-11-18 04:41:00,1590,deer will often snort and stomp when they know something is near but can identify it. chances are the deer knew you were there and were trying to scare ya. both sexes will grunt with a buck having a deeper tone.

403420,Harrison,2009-11-18 13:54:00,2202,Chances are you spooked them.  One may of been trying to call a fawn that may of been with it.  Usually a loner doe with give a giant snort (clearing their nose IMO) before they bolt.  Scares the livin heck out of ya when your walking to a stand in pitch dark and walk up on one.
