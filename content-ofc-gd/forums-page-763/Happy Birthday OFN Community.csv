I remember AndyK's pictorial posts of his many solo expeditions, and Canadave.  Where are they now?!?!?!     Happy birthday, OFC, and a HUGE thanks to the mods for putting up with us"

403229,bigfish1965,2009-11-17 23:18:00,3382,"We kinda passed the day (it was the 15th) that we opened the flood gates to the new site and software. We did a major upgrade not long after and here we are. Another major upgrade will be coming in the late winter or early spring. Personally I was delighted with everyones' transition to the new hi-tech format and how quick the members caught on to the new gadgets, and I hope you like all the new toys that will come as we bring the site up to date. Amazing that only 3 years and our software is out of date. A big thanks from me from a technical standpoint. We still struggle keeping out the spam bots but the rest of the mods are on the pretty quick. The next version is supposed to be bot proof and have new toys to play with including being able to import your Flicker or Photobucket images directly, accessing the site through your facebook, a bigger profile page and much more.   Happy Anniversary guys"

403281,Cast-Away,2009-11-18 01:03:00,790,I think this is the 3rd generation of OFC for me. When did TJ put up the first board? I still remember when the old UofT thread board was popular as well. Does anyone else remember?
403283,ozaibak1,2009-11-18 01:04:00,401,Happy birthday keep up the good work and fun everyone!
403285,misfish,2009-11-18 01:08:00,29133," Am I a 1st or second gen?????,,,,,,,, Uoft? It,s been so long, and so many beers ago."
403286,Roy,2009-11-18 01:08:00,13728,"I remember TJ saying ""If I could get a hundred members posting, we'll be fine"". Hell! I've banned at least three hundred members  .....I must be the biggest pain in his azz! Really great that we're doing so well. Everyone in this community and I DO mean everyone, does their part to keep this place happening. Good stuff for sure.  And, for the record, it's gotta be 6 incarnations. Again for the record, the very first person I spoke to here was Muskystudd NKA ChrisK."
403287,Roy,2009-11-18 01:10:00,13728,"The UofT board was called the Zoo.  edit:   Holy crap! My next post will be 12,000   arrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhh   I need a life!"

The second version http://web.archive.org/web/20020402153808/...geboard/view.pl"
403374,Cookslav,2009-11-18 06:02:00,1457,"Happy B-day  I do remember the 2nd version...I've been around long enough for that I don't know for sure but I'm pretty sure I've been hangin around since about November 2001. Bought a new computer, and got on the net with rogers in my new house, so the time line fits....  Geeze time flys? Might have to make it to one of the G2G's some day to put some faces to the handles LOL!"
403377,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-18 06:10:00,0,happy birthday from a noob!

403389,Marc Thorpe,2009-11-18 11:54:00,621,Its been great from its very conception to the transition to ONFC  I enjoy the reports from the many anglers who share them Its what I look forward to reading
