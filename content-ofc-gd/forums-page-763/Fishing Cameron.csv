403795,DMASSE,2009-11-19 15:24:00,420,"Hello  I got into a heated arguement about when Cameron lake is closed for the season,   my buddy was saying that the MNR opened up most Kawartha's lake to ice fish for panfish...  I told him they close close to the end of the month....  Can anyone here help clarify,  I dont have the regs and my laptop is too slow for a PDF file of them.....  Any help would be appreciated  Dave"
