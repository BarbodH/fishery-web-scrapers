400584,Paully,2009-11-09 10:48:00,712,  What a loving bunch we have here..  Keep at it and eventually you'll get your reward.
400625,[email protected],2009-11-09 14:29:00,290,"I've been to one of the most popular places for steelhead 3 days in a row and hooked into one.  Yesterday i was floating a drift and one came up and slammed my bobber. Snapped it in half lol. Aggressive fish for the lose.....  I saw some other guy hook into one, then he got a phone call and decided to answer it instead of fighting the fish. And he lost it  Other than that, I haven't had any action. I've lost alot of spinners."
400646,BillM,2009-11-09 15:36:00,17367,Swap out the trebles to some single Siwash hooks on those spinners.  You'll reduce the amount of snags you get and the hook up percentage is about as good.
400834,Radnine,2009-11-10 02:15:00,1538," Hee Hee Hee   Hey, you back off pal! Everyone is supposed to get mad at me in these threads, not each other! Jim"
401131,fishinguypat,2009-11-10 23:12:00,547,"college boy eh, Put em up!"
401146,Twocoda,2009-11-10 23:45:00,4130,you can always take up lawn darts...lol...im seriously considering it ...lmao...lately i can hook em but i cant land em ......im only there for the acrobats anyways...
401219,StoneFly,2009-11-11 02:19:00,574," Snagging doesnt count,...dude if you can catch a brown Legit,..you should catch rainbows/steelhead in your sleep.  Knitting is not a bad passtime either   Lol"
401257,fishinguypat,2009-11-11 05:26:00,547,everyone at work say browns are as easy to catch as salmon  but steelhead are a whole other story...one man at my work went to owen sound during aa snow storm and caught 8 steelhead last year...i'll eventually go fishing with this guy!
401321,[email protected],2009-11-11 14:35:00,290,I'm going tonight to my new favorite spot... Most likely going to pick up a new rod too
401323,BITEME,2009-11-11 14:53:00,1968,I have been trying the last three years with a float and havent caught one I ve caught them with other means but the float and bag evades me guys will catch on either side of me and I still get pooched Ill keep banging away not particularly my style of fishing but hey when I do go out I get to watch the sun come up so its all good as for suggestions  I havent got a clue BM
401329,azebra,2009-11-11 15:20:00,168,"i use the frog hair  3X AND 4X    (8.8lb)(6.6lb)   i like it, the diameter is less that then some other large brands, and i find it pretty tough, im happy with it."
401428,TobascoCat,2009-11-11 20:51:00,4, Getting a salmon to hit in the river is alot harder than getting a steelhead to hit. Lining isn't getting a salmon to hit.
401638,NAC,2009-11-12 13:20:00,369,"No offence FGP, but why not just keep fishing til you get one rather than posting about not getting one and opening yourself up to criticism? Niagara is a big river with a lot of fish(steelhead) and a lot of productive spots, maybe you should go try that.  There's no secrets to steelheading and I've seen more helpful info thrown at you by generous folks on this board than I've seen given out to many. Your only solution is time on the water/river, not online."
401892,steelie hunter,2009-11-13 03:39:00,55," +1  This FGP is on all the forums either whining or complaining about steelhead fishing. No one said it was easy. Go out everyday you can. Experience will be your biggest help. Getting tips on here from all these generous people is great, but now go put them to use. Talk to fisherman as well, it also helps a lot.  My very first year last year, I caught two on my first trip, then didnt catch anymore in the next 25 trips maybe. It happens to all of us. But this year I have landed 10 already, in the few times I have been out."
401894,fishinguypat,2009-11-13 03:51:00,547, not for me  and why did you have to come off saying that salmon don't HIT in rivers.Salmon hit many things in rivers...like rocks
401911,TobascoCat,2009-11-13 05:34:00,4,"Hit as in taking your bait, not lining or snagging. Never said salmon don't hit in rivers, I said it's harder to get them to hit versus steelhead. They aren't feeding like fall steelhead so getting them to hit will be harder. I did not say it's impossible."
401982,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-13 18:02:00,0,"curiosity, patience, and being humble will get you very far in your search for steel... there's some VERY knowledgeable anglers on here who will sometimes share info if you are these three things.  arrogance, stubborness etc. will get you the skunk.  see laz's thread and you'll see how to get help (not that you need any right?)"
402022,blaque,2009-11-13 21:56:00,2419,One of the goofier steelhead threads lol
403332,Dozer,2009-11-18 03:30:00,896,...so you got one yet?
403334,fishinguypat,2009-11-18 03:35:00,547,haven't been out lately maybe in 2 weeks ...need the cold weather
403343,BillM,2009-11-18 04:35:00,17367," Rain, we need rain."
403346,fishinguypat,2009-11-18 04:44:00,547,yeah the waters are clear too...a local told me the best time to fish a certain area and i'll go when the time is right
400279,fishinguypat,2009-11-08 01:21:00,547,"i went out 4 times for steelhead this year and everytime i got skunked... i went to ontario tribs and today i hit some huron tribs and nuthin...i'm using light 8lb test 10 foot rod, cured roe, the right amount of split shot...uuggggggggg"
400280,Pigeontroller,2009-11-08 01:26:00,2793,"For Steelheading purposes, 8 lb. test ain't light! Try a lighter line, 4-6 lb. floro, and keep at it."
400284,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-08 01:40:00,0,"if you're not catching, constantly fiddle with weight placement/weight amount...  bobber depth... bait... if you're not catching fish then you likely aren't in the strike zone or you are spooking the fish with too much float/weight... also, 99 percent of the river isn't even going to have fish.  you have to learn where fish are in runs and what they hit on and build off those successes."
400285,justin elia,2009-11-08 01:41:00,151,"FGP, wait for a decent amount of rain to fall (15-30mm) and raise the water levels of the tribs.  Fish the rivers on a clearing trend and you'll more than likely get into some steelhead.  You are probably doing everything right, but timing is more important.  8lb line is fine, if its flouro.t When fishing in clearer water, you may want to scale down.  You may also want to try spinners so you can cover more water.  Maybe you can be more specific on each of your outings (ie. river, water clarity, bait, etc) and someone here can help you out."
400286,fishinguypat,2009-11-08 01:43:00,547,well today on a huron trib and it was very clear...a guy beside me caught one in 2 casts when i was fishing the area for 5-10 min...he had like some kind of a single egg
400289,Twocoda,2009-11-08 01:46:00,4130,get yourself some swivels and tie on a  6 # leader...only in dirty water will i run 8 pound test...  everyone else has given you solid advice...  if no one is catching then switch up to flat fish or something along that line...dont forget they are predators
400293,fishinguypat,2009-11-08 01:56:00,547,k iguess i'll get some kind of fluro what do you recommend?
400295,Twocoda,2009-11-08 02:00:00,4130,as of today i will never use segaur again ....im not a fan of frogs hair either .... for the time being im going to stick with maxima until i find something that will out perform it     If your running a spinning gear then why not just spool up straight 6 and be done with it
400296,DMASSE,2009-11-08 02:04:00,420,FROG HAIR IS AMAZING BUT MOST PEOPLE DONT LIKE IT BECAUSE ITS A TRUE IGFA RATING  SO 6LBS IS LIKE FISHING 3 POUND DRENNAN..  dAVE
400298,BillM,2009-11-08 02:10:00,17367,"I fished FrogHair flouro today for the first time, no complaints at all."
400314,Fang,2009-11-08 03:00:00,1330,When the rivers are low and clear it's a tough bite. Gotta be there first light or scale the line and baits down to really small. Any kind of traffic on the river tends to push fish up into cover. When it's tough fishing and you know the fish are in the river look for wood. Fish that hang up in cover tend to not be as spooky as those resting in pools with lines going by all day.  Make sure you're using 4 lb flouro leaders and small roe bags until the water gets some color and flow. To fish wood be prepared to get snagged up and retie every 5 minutes. It's worth it though.
400327,muddler,2009-11-08 03:51:00,623,"Good suggestion already. I'll add that you may want to try  differnet baits. Flies, worms(plastic and real), single eggs, etc. Present your offering as naturally as possible and in the strike zone. That means ticking the bottom every now and then, light leaders (go as heavy as you can), and the lightest terminal gear you can use.  Stick with it.                          muddler"
400330,steelhead hunter,2009-11-08 04:05:00,152,I would go with 5lb raven fluro that would be a good starting point until you figure out what you need for diferent conditions good luck and keep with it we all know how you feel we all have been there LOL
400345,splashhopper,2009-11-08 12:52:00,2931," Ok....you went out a WHOLE FOUR TIMES... for rainbow trout... and you got skunked.... welcome to trout fishing   Stay out on the tribs.... if the line ain't in the water... you will only catch some fish at Loblaws  I use 8lb main line attached to a very small swivel and then run a 2-3' 4lb leader which is then tied to a #10 or #12 hook.  The split shots can vary depending on the speed of the river( same as the float).  I tend to use 1/3 of a dew worm with the tiniest bit of orange / chartreuse yarn on the hook. ( mainly because I don;t catch salmon and don't have much confidence in store bought ""roe"".)  So far this season, I am a big fat ZERO  for catching any rainbows.... frustrating ... yes.... but the last two season I have caught over 15 bows each...So I know I can catch em..   Like others have said,,, I am playing with the weights... the leader length... and where I am targeting fish....  Some days... the fish gods smile.... some days.... I gotta pay my dues on the river.  That's trout fishing....  But the day I land another one(soon I hope-lol) will be pay off again this season...   And if you are feeling frustrated....  keep at it.... the Leafs have for FORTY YEARS !"
400349,Radnine,2009-11-08 13:14:00,1538, Don't let it bother you. It's not really fishing anyway. Jim
400385,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-08 16:16:00,0,  uh oh!  thems are fightin' words!
400392,Dozer,2009-11-08 17:38:00,896,"Different sized roe bags, different depths, water levels, water clarity, tail outs, blah blah blah...  Listen, when I first started steelheading I got the skunk for a long time, I almost put it into style.  Watch what others are doing, dude casts twice and lands a fish with a small bag... theres an idea?  Be observant.  Clear water, I've found, that the fish sit deep or in cover ( trees, brush, etc. )  Work those areas... Don't scare the fish, try to keep a low profile, dont walk through the water with heavy boots and stir up the bottom... try fresh roe bags... I use white roe bags with a few eggs in clear water and really work the wood.  Finesse fish... cast up close to the wood, drift by, pull back a bit, make your bait come up, then sink again, try it all!  You will loose a tonne of rigs, but hey, its all about learning.  And don't forget to set the hook when your bobber sinks  You may even loose your first two fish   But the one you finally land will be quite rewarding.  Buy a book, read it, read forums, and just keep it at."
400404,Musky or Specks,2009-11-08 19:59:00,2710,Since no one has mentioned it yet. Chum and single eggs. Really helps to produce in tough conditions. Also stay away from smaller tribs. Fish the big rivers. Small tribs are only good on the drop after a freshet. Big rivers hold their water and colour longer and always seem to be bring fresh bows in. In my opinion there are only 2 rivers that almost always have fish. The Not and the Grand. Third choice would be the 'geen. Learn one of those rivers and you wont be dissapointed.
400416,fishinguypat,2009-11-08 21:09:00,547,  a bit more than 4 times...try 4 years
400421,BillM,2009-11-08 22:12:00,17367,"Why not hire a guide?  They aren't just there to make sure you catch fish...  You'll learn more in one day out on the water, then you have in the past 4 years..  Great investment if you ask me."
400422,Musky or Specks,2009-11-08 22:30:00,2710,Also notoced your location. If the golden triangle steelheaders are still arounds its a great group for a beginner to join
400432,dave524,2009-11-08 23:01:00,4508,"On a similar note, that reminds me. I was out of the loop for a few years, got married, teenage kid, now that I retired I am getting back into it. I used to belong to the "" Ontario Steelheaders "" for a lot of years, everyone serious seemed to be a member back in the 80's but all I can find of them online is a webpage that hasn't been maintained since 2004. Are they still around? If not what happened , they were a very dedicated group at one time?"
400457,fishinguypat,2009-11-08 23:40:00,547,naw i know quite a bit about steelheading... i just can't seen to catch a rainbow...i have caught salmon the last 10 years browns the past few ...but no steel
400533,Musky or Specks,2009-11-09 02:44:00,2710,Wow obviously you dont and I think now I see why?
400563,tributaryhunter,2009-11-09 03:53:00,108,"ok you say u know alot about steelheading why are u asking so many damn questions and not catching squat, next time u go out and, people are slamming fish and ur not talk to them and see what ur doing wrong better yet stick to the trout farm lol"
