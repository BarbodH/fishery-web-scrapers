403123,Harrison,2009-11-17 17:16:00,2202,"Hi all, quick question.  I have searched the FAQ of a couple sites with no quick answer.  If a guy hunts only with a compound for the last few years and hurts his shoulder at hockey, would he need a PAL to use a crossbow til he recovers?  Thanks"
403126,Jay T,2009-11-17 17:21:00,282,"A crossbow is not a firearm, no PAL needed."
403129,Fang,2009-11-17 17:26:00,1330,"correct, crossbows and compounds are not governed under the PAL"
403130,LucG,2009-11-17 17:29:00,779,"I heard a rumour that ""they"" were trying to include crossbows into the firearm category.  Was that just a rumour, or was it attempted?"
403134,Twocoda,2009-11-17 17:43:00,4130, i read that too somewhere ...but ill be damed if i can find it ....  with a sore shoulder you are better off with a crossbow ...you can use two hands and a foot to load it
403140,anonymous,2009-11-17 18:04:00,58,"There was talk a few years ago about needing the PAL for a crossbow. Nothing ever came of it. Only requirement to purchase a crossbow is that you are 18 years of age or older. Asking a comparison of compound to crossbow is apples to oranges. Bow vs Crossbow, correct. Recurve vs Compound, correct. Bow vs Compound, incorrect. I have a Ten Point compound crossbow, my friend has an Excaliber recurve crossbow.  If you are going to use a crossbow for hunting, just as you have used a bow, keep in mind that the conditions set for a firearm are the same for you while you are using archery. Unloaded in/on a vehicle, cased from 1/2 hour after sunset to 1/2 hour before sunset."
403151,Harrison,2009-11-17 18:28:00,2202,"Thanks, much appreciated.  As I assumed, but you know what they say about assuming.  I will take a friend up on a last minute offer now!  Cheers"
403169,basketclam,2009-11-17 19:59:00,115,"Yeah, the last point there is a good one.  Under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, crossbows ARE firearms, so make sure you are familiar with the applicable sections of the FWCA.  For federal purposes (PAL, registry, etc.), the crossbow is not considered a firearm."
403198,misfish,2009-11-17 21:48:00,29133," Thats why I went to a crossbow Phil. Shoulder wasnt up to pulling back the draw.I could hold it for awhile,then the arm would start to  quiver."
403870,Harrison,2009-11-19 18:57:00,2202,"I hear ya there, nothing more trying then waiting for the big boy to come out from the tree you drew up on him on and he decides to take a breather. lol"
