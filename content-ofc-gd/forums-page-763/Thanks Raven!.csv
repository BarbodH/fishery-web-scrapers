403190,kemper,2009-11-17 21:37:00,2232,"Last week I busted my Raven float rod, about a foot up from the bottom of the tip section. Fearing my fall season was toast I sent it in for warranty from Kingsway Tackle in Guelph. It was shipped out from Kingsway last thursday, and I have it in my hands today with a brand new tip section. Cost me $30 bucks.  Awesome if you ask me, I have dealt with warranty issues with alot of companies and this was by far the best experience I have ever had (it once too me 6 months to get a reel from Okuma).  Thanks Raven, Its stuff like this that keeps customers around"
403193,highdrifter,2009-11-17 21:42:00,2534,That's awesome Kemp!!  A rod company who understands us..  Was the 30 bones for shipping or cost of the replacement??  cheers HD
403194,blaque,2009-11-17 21:43:00,2419,IM in the exact same boat.......only im in the states. Hope all goes as well for myself
403197,Jet,2009-11-17 21:46:00,364,"Great to hear Raven continues to stand behind its products.  Kemper, how did you break your tip section, if you don't mind me asking?"
403199,kemper,2009-11-17 21:49:00,2232," Was for the replacement part.    I can't quite decide if it was my fault or the rod just blew up...I was fishing up tight to a big limestone wall and had just landed a beauty bow, rod may have (probably did) come in contact with the rock behind me during the fight. Next cast the tip blew up. That said I have heard the IM6 is known for that...but I have used (abused) it for a while and this was the first problem"
403206,Sebastian,2009-11-17 22:02:00,208,"My im6 has 500 scratches and nicks on it and hasn't blown up. It's a solid rod. I broke a 13'6"" years ago and it was my fault. It is a great rod."
403324,l2p,2009-11-18 03:05:00,346,raven has nothing but thumbs up from me! broke my im8 twice 1 time fish broke i unno how and snd time my fault 100 % both times raven replaced no questions asked... ive also lost the center screw for my vectra and apon emailing a raven rep with the story of what happend i get a new one in the mail no questions asked... raven FTW!
403330,justin elia,2009-11-18 03:17:00,151,Paul Almaza from Anglers International does a great job for Raven.  I doubt many people have had bad experiences with their customer service.
403333,troutologist,2009-11-18 03:34:00,951,Agreed  Paul has hooked a few people I know up as well. I haven't broke a Raven rod yet....though a particular fish on the Manistee did everything in its power.
403337,BillM,2009-11-18 04:08:00,17367,"Kemper, time to get a back up man!"
403339,fishinguypat,2009-11-18 04:13:00,547,you call $30 a good deal ha
403359,tributaryhunter,2009-11-18 05:25:00,108,"raven is a company to deal with, plus their products are excellent as well, and good selection"
403404,kemper,2009-11-18 12:54:00,2232," I have one....actually I have two but they just don't cut it when I fish the bigger water out here. The east tribs are fine but the bigger ones not so much  In fact I do, lets weigh the options....  Buy a totally new rod all by myself... $250 BASE Wait months to get a free replacement that is never the one youre actually supposed to get....no thanks Pay the $30 and be fishin again in a week.... Sweet deal!"
