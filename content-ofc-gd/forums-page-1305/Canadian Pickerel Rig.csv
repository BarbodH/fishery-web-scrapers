10355,Beats,2006-12-10 03:30:00,543,"Can anyone tell me a place online I can order some pickerel rigs? I was using one last winter exclusively on one rod while ice fishing Simcoe last year, with success. I have the one I used still but its old and missing one hook. I can seem to find them at BPS or cabelas online. below is a description of what im looking for, for those who don't know what one is. I found this description while searching goole.  "" Canadian Pickerel Rig This is one of the oldest live-bait rigs ever created to help anglers use live bait near bottom. It consists of a monofilament leader to which there is attached two swiveling thin, steel shafts, each having a length of mono line attached to the end of a single hook. At the end of the leader is a snap which is designed to be used with a bell-sinker. The metal arms keep the monofilament leaders and hook away from the main leader. The Canadian Pickerel Rig is popular with walleye anglers that still-fish or drift with live bait in deeper water or current. Live minnows are the best choice for this rig."""

10410,Tdel,2006-12-10 10:51:00,393,Wayne is right.  I got several at Walmart with different hook sizes.  Canadian Tire should have some too.  Tom
10431,brifishrgy,2006-12-10 13:32:00,559,i find tying my own works a lot better ... keep the hooks closer to the mainline for sensitive biting fish

10506,Rich,2006-12-10 16:17:00,3927,Best 87 cents you'll ever spend (if you're a perch fisherman)
10508,Carp,2006-12-10 16:19:00,1488,I love 'em for still fishing current areas or very slow trolling with the electric. (make your own current) You can pick them up at any of the previously mentioned locations. I usually change the hooks to something of better quality. Sometimes I'll add a small cheater hook (single or tiny treble) for the short bites.
