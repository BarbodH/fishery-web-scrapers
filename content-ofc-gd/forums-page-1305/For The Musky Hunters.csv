10619,Cookslav,2006-12-10 20:53:00,1457,Thats an interesting read...  So if they can scientificly prove it was no more then 40 pounds why has it not been revoked? Especialy if the fish is proven to have been augmented by 10 inches?  Is there further contadticting evidence not mentioned in this article? I'm sure this is just a peice of the puzzel But I can't quite understand what would keep it qualified as the record if the allogations are not rebuted?
