They were surprised to find in 45 of the 50 states the recorded last words of drivers in 61.2 percent of fatal crashes were, ""Oh Crap!""  Only the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas and Central Florida were different, where 89.3 percent of the final words were: ""Hold my beer, I'm gonna try somethin'."""
