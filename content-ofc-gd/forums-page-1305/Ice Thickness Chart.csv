10590,Handlebarz,2006-12-10 19:27:00,3790,"I am confused on the first pic, where is the rope that the person should be wearing?  Down here we get some that can not wait and are out there with ropes tied around there waist I just wonder why they do that is it to make it easier to find there bodies?"
10591,irishfield,2006-12-10 19:29:00,26272,YES....

10631,Fisherman,2006-12-10 21:16:00,7201,"Oh,  there's already been one checking out Simcoe somewhere around Glenwoods, nuts."
10639,fishindevil,2006-12-10 21:46:00,6254,"nice chart and its very acurate as well,but that could very depending on what kind of ice there is .sometimes you can have several kinds of it in an area,but i would always er,on the side of caution"
10648,Mike the Pike,2006-12-10 21:58:00,3421,I hope this advice saves a life this season.This chart should have a permanent access on this OFC site.Hey can some one put it up on the site.It may help those people with the twisted genes they were born with.Mike
10667,Fisherman,2006-12-10 22:55:00,7201,"Ya, you're right, some should have it stapled to their forehead."
10678,setomonkey,2006-12-10 23:15:00,872,"And pay attention to what else is near you, I hear that every year some cars go through the ice on Simcoe b/c parking on land isn't convenient, and the people think it's safe to park on the ice b/c there are other cars already there.  :o  I think MuskyBill posted a picture of some cars that went through from last January...  Mike"
10686,GbayGiant,2006-12-10 23:30:00,1780,"Thats a nice basic picture chart for the guys that can't read, usually the same guys on the thin ice."
