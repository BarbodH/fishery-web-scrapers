9905,SHAD,2006-12-08 21:54:00,134," Hey gb, what model motorguide is that one?  Looks like a sweet bowmount, wireless too?"
9923,irishfield,2006-12-08 22:23:00,26272,"I bought me one of those as well Shad..thanks to Ron's last minute suggestion...Pic is the W55...mine is a W75 x 60"" with a lot of accessories attached to it..LOL. Guess that stuff will be on my ""what did ya buy in 2007"" list.  This years stuff..where do I start...no issues with anything so far."
10007,GbayGiant,2006-12-09 03:09:00,1780,"Thats just a pic of the 55lbs thrust they look the exact same, I got the 75lbs as well though. It's there newest model wireless foot control and the hand remote was $50 extra but I never use it.  Irish if you figure out a way to stop all the beeping please let me know, lol......besides that it's perfect."
10030,irishfield,2006-12-09 04:58:00,26272,GBay..Marc Thorpe has the same motorguide...maybe he knows how to shut it up. I bought an extra foot pedal to have one at each end of the boat. I doubt I'd use the key fob...unless maybe mounted right to a rod.

10206,fishingguy28,2006-12-09 20:30:00,98,Here was a pretty pricy buy.... by far the most expensive purchase i have ever made!!!!!!       
10208,BrownTown,2006-12-09 20:36:00,103,"-13'6 bell im6 steelhead rod in the spring..( completly sucked) so i returned it. - 13' quantum steelhead rod (still using) great rod, great warrenty, great backbone. (only if they made 15') - Islander steelheader float reel- all i can say is this is a great reel! - Quantum accurist levelwind- all around awesome reel...had no problems as of yet and heavily used it in the late summer. -St.Croix avid 7' medium heavy rod 10-20lb rating- no problems yet, muscled in a few big logs too! - Simms G3 waders..just amazing!"
9374,camillj,2006-12-07 05:26:00,1988,Well lets see .... I bought a Pete Maina rod .. from you  ... which I love ...except I like em better when I can break them in two before getting into the car ...  and a Calcutta reel ... which I realllllly love (with you at BPS)  and a Lowrance H20C ... which I reallllllllllllly love (from LB)  and a Aquavue Scout XL which I reallllllllllllllllly love (also from LB)  and a few dozen lures (off ebay)  and a couple of slopmasters (from John)  and a Cat heater (actually it was a gift from my mother in law) much like yours except mine has a coffee mug shaped base which just happens to also fit into a golf cart cup holder  and did I mention a couple dozen lures  and a replacement for my Humminbird (which I havent yet seen but its coming) (off ebay)  and a 4 man portable tent style hut (off ebay) .. which got stolen within abut a month ... soon to be replaced with something alot easier to erect and take down  and a new manual auger ... which ... while it cuts like butter is soon to be augmented with a Jiffy 30 (since everyone says how great they are)  a couple of spinning reels to replace the ones that are starting to show just a little too much wear and tear   a digital scale  a couple of 9.9'hp motors .. my favourite was one I got quite impromptu from Bigcliff whilst fishing across the lake from his dock  another Penn 209 (off ebay)... just think these are the best reels for spooling up with Leadcore and for downrigging for salmon   a new pair of polaroids (old ones were all marked up ... so they are available for newbies who come along for the ride  Jeesh now that I see it all written down I am embarrassed .. you would think that after over 40 years of fishin hard I wouldnt need much ... the sad thing is I have a new list of things that I NEED for this year

Its fantastic  Scotty laketroller clamp on downrigger -my first downrigger put a lot of lakers in my freezer, even a speckle and a steelhead. Had it on my canoe, boat, my brother's boat and a few others. Great for the small deep northern lakes back home.  A variety of spoons for the downrigger. The most effective was a red/gold Cleo. The speckle, Steel and most of the lakers were all on that Cleo  The aftermarked LED conversion kit for my miniMag -A HUGE improvement over the standard bulb."

9055,Pigeontroller,2006-12-06 20:26:00,2793,"My main purchase this year was a Lowrance LMS-332C GPS/Sonar combo. An absolutely amazing machine! The gps takes so much of the guess work away, I hardly use my old Hydrographic maps now. The Colour Sonar is light years ahead of my old 64x120 Grayscale Raytheon.  I also picked up a St Croix Premier 6'-9"" XH jerkbait rod, this is an extremely stiff and powerful rod! Though I think the 6'-3"" might have been a better length for me."
9058,Squid,2006-12-06 20:32:00,1656,st.croix 7.2 extra heavy muskie rod and a calcutta 400 reel. A real nice combo. Next year I am going to be buying a Lowrance LCX-25C. Oh and I need a Frabill net for those huge muskies that I will catch next summer. Bunch of muskie baits.
