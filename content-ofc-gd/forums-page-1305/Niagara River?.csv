Anyway, one thing I would love to know is what the water looks like on the Niagara right now. Has anyone fished it recently?  THanks!  Paulus"
10230,Alumacraft,2006-12-09 21:45:00,139,"Hey Paulus forget about the niagara the winds around here have been wreaking havoc on lake erie. It is not going too be fishable for awhile. Maybe by the end of the week if the winds lay down, if they don't lay down then who knows.All I know is that I'm starting to twitch and shake, we should be crushing the steelies right now. Rob"
