10067,Iamcanadian,2006-12-09 12:06:00,14,I drove by Head lake in Haliburton yesterday and saw snowmobile tracks across the lake.It has only been frozen over for a day. What kind of lure do you use to catch a snowmobile in 15 feet of water??
10070,Terry,2006-12-09 12:21:00,14456,man some people are dumb  but I guess they fall though and die and the dumb gene is removed from the gene pool and life goes on
10076,Tdel,2006-12-09 13:22:00,393,"There always seems to be some guy who has to be the first person to cross a lake, bay or river first every year.  Whether it be by foot or machine, sooner or later, they end up in the obituaries.  For some reason Terry that gene pool never seems to empty.  There is always another one to take their place, but man you are right they aren't very smart when it comes to stuff like this.   Tom"
10077,troutologist,2006-12-09 13:25:00,951,No way its that easy the dumb gene seems to be wide spread especially prevalent in association with the internal combustion engine. you'd think putting a sled through the ice is cheap the way some folks do it.
10083,Dano,2006-12-09 13:46:00,719,"Morons. I tell you one thing, if these idiots go through, I hope no one risks their own lives in an effort to rescue them. Just wave bye bye from shore."
10088,turtle,2006-12-09 14:07:00,274,"Unfortunately for their families. some of these guys have kids and the gene passes on.  I was on a lake in Haliburton for 15 years and there were seven winter drownings, three in one incident.  My cottage was about 300-400 m from the narrows where they went through the ice.  Always at night and mostly with mr. booze on board."
10106,Rizzo,2006-12-09 15:17:00,4754,its because of idiots like that I have to work on the week-end  p.s. I'm a funeral director
10107,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-09 15:23:00,2585,they must have been going mach 1 not to go through the ice.  Bet they were not letting that sled slow down at all.  Sledding on ice that is thin is maybe the dumbest thing they could do on a sled.
10141,fishindevil,2006-12-09 17:33:00,6254,"well they are guys that i read about in the paper,thats just plain stupidness"
10166,irishfield,2006-12-09 18:35:00,26272, LARGE treble from the back of an air boat/scoot. Done all winter long on Little Dog channel in Honey Harbour...were at least they can bail and jump to the shoreline before it goes down.  Unfortunate...but only a matter of time before the first drowning is announced on the Radio. Two winters ago it was my daughter's (now X)boyfriend's cousin on Orr Lake....and of course at night!
10192,Fisherman,2006-12-09 19:46:00,7201,"Small world Wayne, that fellow was related to one of the guys at work here, orinally from Elmvale."
10195,ccmtcanada,2006-12-09 19:55:00,7971,You said you noticed tracks going OUT in the lake....did you happen to see any coming back in?  Maybe they are already fish food!
10199,Kerry,2006-12-09 20:04:00,383,I remember that incident too Wayne.The lake had just frozen over  Kerry
10202,irishfield,2006-12-09 20:08:00,26272,Yep...the guy he was following made it across though. I drove by there on Thursday and it's iced over...hopefully no repeats this year.
10209,lew,2006-12-09 20:37:00,12767,"Hearing about guys snowmobiling across lakes that they know have only been frozen a couple days and then breaking thru, is kinda like watching  Evil Knievel crash his motorcycle while attempting a 300' jump across a bunch of school buses  You SORTA feel sorry for them...........but then again...........maybe you don't ??"
10280,GbayGiant,2006-12-09 23:49:00,1780,I find that alot of people go through the ice in a current area were the ice wont get thick. It's always a good idea to know the water your on as well. The guys out on first ice just have no common sense.
10282,cityfisher,2006-12-10 00:02:00,959,moronsssss ! you have to be dumb in the head to go on the ice this time of the year... i wont be testing the ice till late january
10284,Beans,2006-12-10 00:19:00,3339,Dang !  They'd need pontoons on their sleds if they tried going across Pigeon Lake at the north end...some lagoons and back bays are frozen over and snow covered but someone other than me can test the thickness...
10288,Nemo,2006-12-10 00:41:00,727,Hope they read this thread.  Do You Know How To Swim?
10292,icewalker28,2006-12-10 01:00:00,39,"Well , let's do the math...... 1 sled = 500lbs. 1 alcoholic= 140 lbs. = 640 pounds. I think 1 "" of ice would hold them.....lol I remember people driving cars and trucks past me on the Bog last year for opener on 7"" or 8 "". Nothing but travel by foot till at least mid-January."
10299,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:36:00,90,i like the theory of the dumb gene being removed...let them ride
