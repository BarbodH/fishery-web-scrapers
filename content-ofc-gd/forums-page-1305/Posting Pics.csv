10877,tjsa,2006-12-11 12:58:00,1578,"OR, instead of registering on a photo site........................  This is a good photo resizing program, and its free.  http://www.download3000.com/download-Visua...t-reg-8155.html  Download it, and install it.  Make a new folder on your desktop, or anywhere you like, and call it whatever you want. Copy your pictures into said folder. Start up Visualizer Photo Resize, and indicate the path to your folder. You can now choose size and aspect ratio, along with ""options"" such as a watermark or embedded text such as a copyright logo before hitting the resize button on the bottom right. You can resize multiple pictures also, not just one at a time. I have done about 10 or more over 1 meg in size, and it takes only seconds. Once you hit resize, the program makes a new folder in the folder you created, called ""resized"", and in that folder your pictures will usually be small enough to upload to message boards."
