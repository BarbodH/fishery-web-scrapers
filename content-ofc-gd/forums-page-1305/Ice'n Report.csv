10290,icewalker28,2006-12-10 00:54:00,39,"The temps have been very cold here the last week and the lakes are starting to freeze over. I was joined by a fellow board member Ben  and we headed out for a fish. We found 4-5"" of good black ice. This is just a small lake that froze over last weekend. We ended with 2 pike and they were caught on a Fat Boy micro jig and a waxie. We are treking out tomorrow and giving it another shot. Cheers   "
10293,urbanangler1990,2006-12-10 01:02:00,933,ahh nice! would u stop teasing me!
10294,Terry,2006-12-10 01:07:00,14456,now you've gone and done it    I now have to run around the house and put together all my ice fishing stuff  then sit and wait for good ice down here   great to see people getting out
10305,Kerry,2006-12-10 01:40:00,383,Good for you icewalker.Keep them reports comin! Kerry
10307,Greencoachdog,2006-12-10 01:41:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics!!! Those pics make it look like it's a tad on the chilly side up there?... and it doesn't look like you've got enough clothes on to me, if that was me up there... I'd look like the Michelin Man trimmed in Coyote fur!"
10326,trapshooter,2006-12-10 02:24:00,1234,Ah.. Sweet!  It was a pleasure getting out with you today IW28.  Maybe tomorrow I can even catch a fish  At least it was a good day to dust off the old ice gear and break in some new equipment.  Should also mention we scouted a few other lakes in the North Bay area and they were a NO GO!  2+ inches on the first hole close to shore so we stayed off.
10338,TechnaGirl,2006-12-10 02:49:00,15,Looking forward to gettin out with you boys tomorrow! Hopefully I'll have better luck than Ben did today!
10347,PatB,2006-12-10 03:19:00,104,"First ice report, awsome, can't wait till we get some ice a little south of you, about 4hrs. south......"
10348,tip-up,2006-12-10 03:20:00,94,Feels nice to finally jig through a hole 'eh...hehe! Thanks for the report and pics IceWalker. How many inches up there?
10351,fishdawg,2006-12-10 03:25:00,912,  only a few more weeks till THE TRIP Terry!  Hold on!  but ya would be nice to get out before that!
10360,trapshooter,2006-12-10 03:40:00,1234,"  You're talking about ice right?  lol.  We punched a hole in a bay on Trout lake and it was only about 2"" so we left it be.  The lake we did fish on had 3-5"" depending on what part of the lake.  Nice solid ice for the most part too.  TechnaGirl - hopefully you can figure out how to use the Auger cause you're punchin your own holes tomorrow!"
10362,TechnaGirl,2006-12-10 03:53:00,15,can we all fish out of the same hole?
10363,tip-up,2006-12-10 03:56:00,94, Yes...  We have 3''-4'' here on a few back bays  Let it all melt and bring on the second phase  -Andrew

We had a blast, it took me a while but I finally learned that each person gets their own hole to fish through! Who would have thought!? I had a nibble, Ben lost his lure (Pike bit it off), but we didn't catch anything..... maybe next time! Here's me gettin a line in the water...  And Ben (trapshooter)... nice new floater suit!!! wow wow wee wow! "
