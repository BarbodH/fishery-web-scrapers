10340,Deano,2006-12-10 02:52:00,767,"sounds like your pop up blocker is blocking the links. there should be a yellowish banner that appears when you here the pop sound at the top of your explorer window. it will say temporarily allow pop ups, click it, page will refresh and the link should now work. you'll have to do that everytime unless you turn off the blocker all together, but that will leave you vulnerable ."
