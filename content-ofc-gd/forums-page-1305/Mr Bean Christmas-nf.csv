10237,Rich Clemens,2006-12-09 22:12:00,3131,Mr. Bean is my hero.   I had purchased the complete box set and watch it from time to time.  The guy has to a be genious to be that stupid and not even look like he is 'acting'.   I did see there were some cartoon versions ... saw some at one of the camps were were at a couple years ago.    They need to make a BEAN 2
10256,dsn,2006-12-09 22:40:00,1018,  hey thats not a bad idea of purchasingthe entire set. Do know why I didn't figure that one out long ago.  dsn
