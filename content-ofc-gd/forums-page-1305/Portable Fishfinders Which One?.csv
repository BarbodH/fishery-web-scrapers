9644,Dondorfish,2006-12-08 01:38:00,1000,Eagle beats hummingbird everytime  - IMHO    Don
9649,Blake,2006-12-08 02:00:00,418,"Go with the Eagle Fisheasy 245DS. Check different places for the best prices, but hands down go with the Fish easy."
9650,Smokey,2006-12-08 02:02:00,1278,I had a fisheasy for a few yrs and no complaints about the unit. Eagles always seem to work well for the price.
9810,setomonkey,2006-12-08 16:15:00,872,"I've got the Eagle Fish Easy 2 and like it, good value for the money.  Mike"
9815,misfish,2006-12-08 16:42:00,29133,"Whats with this portable thing All depth finders are portable.You just have to modify abit and there ya go.I have been using the same one now 5 years.It wasnt a portable as you call it.It was off the boat.Made a small carring box,made a holder for the trassducer and there ya go.  I would look into a used one and do up a bag/box. As for power,12 volt gel cell works awesome.   "
9855,tonyb,2006-12-08 19:31:00,1637,"Gopher the colour! Seriously, check out the colour units.  They cost more but are well worth it  Humminbird 585c is nice.  Tony"
10172,fishindevil,2006-12-09 18:38:00,6254,"always go with eagle/lowrance the rest of them dont even stack up to these,and lowrance is in mississuaga so its not a problem with warranty or repairs....   dont bother with that humminbird junk....just my 2 cents"
10581,Chris Cross,2006-12-10 18:39:00,46,"I've had a few portable units. The Fish'n Buddy and fish'n' Buddy 2 are crap. I made a dash mount unit portable and used it for a few seasons. It was not easily setup and the battery is a pain to drag around. Now, I have the Hummingbird Pirana Max 10. It's the best I've used so far. It is very easy to carry and set up. I get over 10 hours of use on ice with 8 rechargable ""aa"". I hard wire it to the electric troll motor for the summer. I even use it in the canoe. I got it at a trade show for $125. The retail is probly $200 Any questions PM me. CX"
10588,tjsa,2006-12-10 19:15:00,1578,"Like misfish said, any sonar can be used as a portable unit, just takes the use of an appropriate battery, and the sealed lead acids work just fine. But, the use of LCD's in winter months is limited to temperature. They can be really slow displaying, or not work at all if not protected. I have used my eagle Fish I.D. in winter, in warmer temps, but not in anything less than -10C. Don't want to risk damage to it in colder temps. I don't own a flasher yet, may not even buy one, I know my area pretty well."
10675,setomonkey,2006-12-10 23:10:00,872,"tjsa,  Thanks, I've always wondered why people liked flashers vs. sonars for ice-fishing.  There are probably other reasons, but the issue with LCD screens and cold temps makes a lot of sense to me.  Mike"
10798,camillj,2006-12-11 03:20:00,1988,Ive been using a Humminbird 4000 for years on the ice ... works great .. recently it died so I got the 40004D (good to 400 feet) I know its old technology but it works great out in the minus 20 degree weather and runs for a couple of days with two of the 6 volt flashlight batteries  so I am sticking with it ... the reason I like it as a protable is that the whole thing fits into a handy sturdy case ... also with the clamp adapter for the transducer I can put it on virtually any boat come softwater time.  I think if I was buying new Id probably agree wth the eagle/lowrance especially if I was opting for the GPS combo ...
