10395,bigfish1965,2006-12-10 05:35:00,3382,16 degrees! Nice..sorry ice fishing guys. But I hate shovelling snow. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/1...30.htm?CAON0530
10400,ccmtcanada,2006-12-10 06:11:00,7971,"I know there are lots on the board waiting for the ice, but for me, I'll take warm any day!!!"
10403,SlowPoke,2006-12-10 06:15:00,2984,It's about time... it's been a long snowy winter here in London! -Brian
10408,Tdel,2006-12-10 10:04:00,393,"Geez, I have mixed feelings about this.       On one hand I was looking forward to ice fishing and on the other hand I was hoping to have a short winter.  Looking on the bright side, I might end up having a bit of both.  I feel better already.   Tom"
10419,Rich Clemens,2006-12-10 12:46:00,3131,"I thought that was just a 'light dusting' you got there SlowPoke - at least looking at the cool pics in your other post.  Sheeeez, I'd hate to see what you would call a real snowfall.  I ain't looking forward to seeing anything like that.  I could like with Rick's 16 C through the winter ... then warm up for spring.  Stay warm buddy."
10427,Ron,2006-12-10 13:14:00,1683,"As far as I'm concerned, it can stay at 16 degs all year round."
10430,lew,2006-12-10 13:26:00,12767,Just looking at Slowpokes pictures of the London snowstorm from last week was more than enough winter for me and now it's time to move onto springtime
10438,Garyv,2006-12-10 13:57:00,547,Well that's fine by me...or maybe not considering I plough snow in winter.  Oh well there's always next month.
10440,Handlebarz,2006-12-10 14:00:00,3790,I just hope that small warm spell here keeps the ice off the boat launch here so I can get out one or two more times this year and why is it that muskie closer is on a Friday I think Monday is a better place for it.
10444,dwc67,2006-12-10 14:12:00,140,and when it drops to -12 shortly after it feels like a hard kick in the sleigh bells.  i'll take winter
10460,hawkeye,2006-12-10 14:55:00,162,I hate to shovel or drive in that white crap. I also like an ice fishing trip or two. But with this warm weather I figure we are living on borrowed time. Mother nature usually gets us in the end
10462,TJQ,2006-12-10 15:09:00,7806,Well its about time spring got here...
10463,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-10 15:10:00,2585,it will be nice but like hawkeye sais mother nature will catch up.  and most likely with a dumping of white stuff the 3rd weekend in may!
10467,fishing n autograph,2006-12-10 15:14:00,2540,Can't wait for the warm weather! Inspection and Drill are a pain in the behind when it's -5....the other day I had drill and it was -11....
10476,danc,2006-12-10 15:38:00,4677,"There's not one day in the next weeks forecast that doesn't call for temps above freezing up here. That's unheard of. It could easily be -20 or -30 by now. One one hand, you gotta like global warming. But on the other hand, this planet is doomed."
10541,Carp,2006-12-10 17:04:00,1488," Not sure about the ""long winter"" statement since winter hasn't officially started yet, but I know the London area got hammered with snow last week. Rising temps could cause flooding."
10542,Rich,2006-12-10 17:05:00,3927, LOL
