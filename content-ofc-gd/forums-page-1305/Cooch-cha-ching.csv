10134,Kerry,2006-12-09 17:10:00,383,Well I was by on Hwy 11 yesterday and didn't get a pic so this morning I thought I'd take a couple of coochy!    from Hwy 11 and    from the park looking towards Big Chief Island. Hopefully by the New Year things will be safe. Kerry
10138,Rizzo,2006-12-09 17:14:00,4754,thanks for the update. Won't be long now on some of the smaller lakes a bit north of here.
10185,misfish,2006-12-09 19:08:00,29133,"Well I guess launching the boat there is out of the question.LOL  Kerry did ya happen to go by the other lake near there?   Saddly with the +14 they are calling for next week,it will be all gone."
10197,Kerry,2006-12-09 19:59:00,383,Our end of Simcoe had some ice at fisherman's cove even before the deep freeze the other night Brian but it isn't anything to write home about yet.I have a buddy that lives on St John who I haven't spoke with yet but will let me know when it's good at the north end.I assume it's much the same as cooch right now and as antsy as I am to try out that new Clam it can wait until the new year.I'm also hoping for enough snow for my wife and I to stay at Haliburton Forest between Christmas and New Years.Right now it looks like mother nature is just pulling our strings.  Kerry

10313,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:45:00,90,damn and its all going to melt
10319,Kerry,2006-12-10 01:53:00,383,That's the sled I got last year.It was fun ridin' last year as opposed to the old cougar which had less than half the suspension.I'm hoping for her maiden voyage this year to be at the forest if we get enough snow. I'm hoping we'll have good ice by new years -sounds good brian. I'll find out when it's good at the airport side.That's usually my first trip location to the lake. Kerry
