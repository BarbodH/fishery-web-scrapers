9892,Smokey,2006-12-08 21:16:00,1278,Great pictures. Thanks and I was complaining about the cold this morning. I guess I should be lucky I didn't have to shovel.
9898,steve_paul,2006-12-08 21:29:00,658, It's gonna rain on Monday so I will shovel Tuesday   but thanks for the offer lol.  Also noticed that the 14 day forecast here is calling for 12 degrees on Dec 19 - looks like all this will be gone by then
9915,urbanangler1990,2006-12-08 22:17:00,933," Eh no problem lol, here to itll be up in the double digits."
9944,MuskyBill,2006-12-08 23:38:00,311,"Wowee, what a fantastic report....  Thanks for taking the time!"
9975,Rizzo,2006-12-09 01:55:00,4754,those are some unbelievable pictures.  Suddenly the dumping we got (close to a foot) doesn't seem so bad!
9984,tip-up,2006-12-09 02:06:00,94,"Time to get the sleds out   Wow, quite the ''Dusting'' you got SlowPoke   Send some this way why don't ya..."
9985,Lostchild,2006-12-09 02:15:00,153,"Wow, that is insane! By the looks of things it should all be melted in the next week or so. Can't wait to see the flood pictures!  Stay safe.  14 day trend for London weather...  "
9988,ccmtcanada,2006-12-09 02:18:00,7971,Hey...Toronto's going to be even warmer...up to 15 on the 21st...maybe fishing isn't done til spring...WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!

10144,Rizzo,2006-12-09 17:37:00,4754,this is as bad as it got up here a few days ago.  Next time I'm grumbling and shoveling I'm gonna click on this thread and look at those pictures again.  Puts everything in to perspective

10311,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:44:00,90,we have 1cm of snow in the kawarthas
10321,TechnaGirl,2006-12-10 02:05:00,15,"SlowPoke- What happened to the 4th pic of your Cherokee in front of the school?! That was an amazing pic, wanted to show it to my folks in Tbay... and YES, that is what we would call a ""light dusting"", although we havent had a dump like that in years!"
10332,SlowPoke,2006-12-10 02:37:00,2984,"Thanks for pointing it out Techna, I accidently deleted it from photobucket.... it's back now. BTW, nice to see you on the new board"
10373,pameladallaire,2006-12-10 04:38:00,470,The snow here is permanent.  Until spring that is.  A warm front in Timmins is -2 degs.  That is what it is outside right now.  Warm.  Pam
9717,SlowPoke,2006-12-08 07:29:00,2984,"I had green grass this morning when I went to bed. When I woke up this afternoon we had an inch or two of snow. Went to work at 4:30 PM and it started coming down pretty good. Headed out on the highway and it got ugly, really ugly. There was an accident in Ingersol (20KM East of London) involving some trucks...  (MrEh, I hope your driver was alright)  Once I was east of Woodstock everything was clear. Headed back for London and it got ugly again. Made my way back to the yard and helped a few people on the way home to find my wife shovelling the driveway for the third time this evening.  (I'm a lucky man)  Parked the van and fired up the Jeep!    Began clearing some snow    Onto the road and off to Timmies to get a treat for my wife.    Stopped by the kids school on the way... going to email the principal ""What do you mean snowday? we made it here!""    All this snow in the last 7 hours and it's still coming down hard. I'd say by the ""snow-on-the-bbq-meter"" that we're at about 30"" now with no wind or drifting.  That's it for now... might head back out in the Jeep for some do-gooding -Brian"
9721,spanky,2006-12-08 10:54:00,195,"hey, clean off the roof of your SUV, the guy behind you can't see with all the snow in his face lol (atleast you got most of it cleaned off, unlike most around here--- i mean the windshield wiper path is enough clean, right?), but hey atleast all the snow looks ""light"" LOL ..... i'm glad it's you and not us for sure!!  Looks like ya'll will be having tonnes 'o fun out that way.... with no snow on the ground my wifes boss managed to get her 3 week old GMC Yukon (Denali too i believe) rear ended on the highway yesterday..."
9723,Terry,2006-12-08 11:23:00,14456,well you can just keep that up there
9725,Ron,2006-12-08 11:40:00,1683,"Now that is some snow!  We got our first snowfall last week, about 8"". It's all gone now. Your Principal is just gonna love that photo!"
9726,Blake,2006-12-08 11:46:00,418,Please keep it up there.  Think of it as an early Xmas present.
9733,Basskicker,2006-12-08 12:41:00,421,Awesome...now that's snow....too bad the ice wasn't that thick..hehehehe..  Jason
9736,ccmtcanada,2006-12-08 12:44:00,7971,"Wow...sucks to live in a snowbelt!!!  I used to drive every weekend from Toronto to Michigan, thru London and Sarnia.  In the winter, you could always count on snow between Woodstock and Sarnia....the 402 especially is a snow magnet!!!"
9741,dustink,2006-12-08 12:58:00,526,"OK, OK....I'll stop whining about the dusting we got down here yesterday.  Point taken!  LOL  That's a great post btw!  Love the shot in front of the school.  dk"
9743,Raf,2006-12-08 13:09:00,3495,Nice shots!    To the Cherokee.  What kind of a lift do you have on it?
9744,Joey,2006-12-08 13:12:00,9122,Those are some great pics.  Kind of makes me feel a bit better about the sprinkle we got here in Richmond Hill this morning.  I'll remember that when I dust off my car this morning  Have a great day and for goodness sakes - go have a snowball fight okay  Joey
9749,BrownTown,2006-12-08 13:29:00,103," this was last night around 2 am, my neighbours car... London of course!"

9761,Entropy,2006-12-08 14:08:00,747,You've got to love the vehicles we own as outdoor enthusiasts.  We must get to T. H. in any weather!  lol  That's awesome....  Entropy  The snow ontop is for extra weight =  traction.  Good thought.
9767,Headhunter,2006-12-08 14:20:00,5703,"Very cool shots!!! I spoke with my Dad last night, he lives in Komoka, just west of London. He's been shovelling for two days, luckily he has a good snow blower! Look out Kitchener area as it looks like it's moved over you guys! HH"
9775,Entropy,2006-12-08 14:31:00,747,Come to think of it..... I don't even own a good snow shovel right now....  Off to Canadian Tire !!!  Entropy
9786,SlowPoke,2006-12-08 15:27:00,2984,"It's okay, that snow is strapped to the roof rack and I am delivering it to your driveway!  He replied regarding my wife doing the shovelling ""Do you hire her out?"" We're currently in negotiations.  Thanks Dustin, 4 second shutter (no flash) and a cold steady hand!  Thanks Raf, It's a 4.5"" Rustys lift with leaf packs and 31"" Goodyear MTR's The Jeep is for sale in case anyone is interested. I guess I can't advertise ""never winter driven""  Our street was flooded last week from a storm sewer backup after the rain.. the water was making it's way up the slope of our street to my psycho neighbours driveway when the city came and sucked the sewer clean. I have comfort in knowing that sewer is clean for the coming melt!"
9789,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-08 15:34:00,2585,Man that is so awesome!  Im totally fine with snow storms as long as I dont have to drive in them.  I want a snow day!  Cheers!

9827,steve_paul,2006-12-08 17:19:00,658, Come down here and enjoy ours - but please shovel the driveway before you open the door  and let the snow pour in
9832,urbanangler1990,2006-12-08 17:43:00,933,"Id like to get up there sometime    , how big is ur driveway? i charge between 10-20 dollars   , depending on size"

9884,kemper,2006-12-08 20:48:00,2232,"PLEASE SEND SOME MY WAY!  I want to get out on my snowboard, badly. And since its 40 bucks to go now ive changed my style to street/handrails and whatever else I can jump off of around town. This cannot be done without a good amount of snow.
