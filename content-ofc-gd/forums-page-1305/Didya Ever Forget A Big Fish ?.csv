10454,Meely,2006-12-10 14:37:00,282,"That was a great time fellas. Always enjoy ""hookin' "" up with the good people from this board. I'm really hoping to get together a lot more in the future. Its not about the catching but the time spent while trying to catch.   Wait til ya'z try Meely's Mouthwatering Ribz !!! Knock your socks off !!!  Meely"
10457,lew,2006-12-10 14:46:00,12767," Lookin forward to it bud, just give us the time & date"
10473,Carp,2006-12-10 15:34:00,1488,"Haven't fished in your boat Lew...yet. Someone took that pic. If it was an OFNer, sooner or later they'll recognize the it.  Could you have been out with a trailer/cottage neighbour ? Is it possible you were alone ? Try and think of the clothes you are wearing ? Obviously it's warm and sunny. Possibly June, July, August, Sept.  Anything on the boat that can narrow the timeframe ? Newer gear, etc.  If it's a spot you fish often, you should remember the background and weed bed. If that doesn't click, it could be a hotspot for someone else who was in the boat with you.  Would you have been driving the Dakota, the Safari, an earlier vehicle, or is it possible someone else was trailering your boat for you, maybe to their favourite lake ?  Just trying to help you shuffle the files between your ears. When you least expect it, you'll remember.  Oh, and a very sweet fish, even if the day is a blur."
10502,lew,2006-12-10 16:10:00,12767,"Thanks Remo, I've been going over all that stuff for a long time, but it's still a blank.   As for not fishing with me yet, I'm pretty sure you know how to rectify that problem"
10514,setomonkey,2006-12-10 16:29:00,872," No kidding! And not just the memory, but enough to have a wall of pictures of muskies over 45""!  Hope you figure it out Lew...  Mike"
10517,Eddyk,2006-12-10 16:35:00,195,"Lew , Thats probably one that I caught and let you hold it for the picture."
10112,lew,2006-12-09 15:36:00,12767,"Do you have any fish'n pictures that you draw a total blank on and can't recall any details about them ??  I have a ""Florida"" type room attached to my trailer and it's pretty well decorated with fishing stuff, and one wall is dedicated to nothing but pictures of muskies over 45"", and this is one of them, but I know ABSOLUTELY nothing about the picture other than the fact that's it's me holding  the fish  It's my current boat, so I know the picture was taken since '99, but other than that I have no clue about anything pertaining to it.......I don't know what lake it's on, I don't know when it was taken or who took the picture, I don't know how  big the fish is, and I don't even have any idea as to who my fish'n partner was that day, but I'm assuming we had a good day on the water  Over the years I've shared my boat with nearly 60 different OFNers, so I'm hoping one of you out there will recall the day and can fill me in on some of the missing the details  I don't drink and I don't smoke and have never done drugs, so I can't blame any of that stuff.  Am I alone on this, or have any of youz ever had ""one of those moments"" ??  "
10114,Dondorfish,2006-12-09 15:49:00,1000,Lew - try right clicking on the picture and then on properties. Might give ya a clue to at least when the picture was taken and by what camera.   Don
10130,Dondorfish,2006-12-09 16:52:00,1000,Oh and by the way - must be nice to have caught so many big muskies that you can't remember  a big one like that. LOL   Don
10135,Blake,2006-12-09 17:11:00,418,Lake looks like Pigeon or Scugog in the earlier days.
10136,Rizzo,2006-12-09 17:13:00,4754,"wow what a great problem to have!  You've caught a ton of muskies since that one was taken I'm sure, not surprising you can't recall the details of each."
10140,moemoe,2006-12-09 17:25:00,352,"I Haven't ever forgot a fish, but fishing storied seem to be forgotten...For instance my brother, who is one of my main fishing fishing partners, seems to forget how the outings actually went.....Like Spring salmon fishing, He'll say ""remember the day when we went something like 22 for 28 for Salmon? That was the best day!"" and i'll say noooo, but I remember when we went 10 for 15?....The things we forget as fisher people are the actual story...lol"
10142,Blake,2006-12-09 17:36:00,418,"By the way Lew I have never forgot a big fish yet, but we are all getting older LOL"
10146,fishindevil,2006-12-09 17:38:00,6254,"WOW...lew im surprised,that you cant remeber i have a really bad memory   and usually cant remeber things from a week ago,my girl is always giving me crap for not rmrmbering things like   honey can you pick up some milk on the way home,   that kinda stuff always eludes me,   but when it comes to big fish like yours  i always remember them.....lol.lol anyways good luck trying to find out when you caught that nice musky....."
10153,Greencoachdog,2006-12-09 18:04:00,8163,"I find I have ""Those moments"" the older I get... but I do remember that fish, I caught it and let you have your pic taken with it."
10159,lew,2006-12-09 18:16:00,12767," Nope, not Scugog as I never fish there but it could be Pigeon, but the location isn't really important, I'd just rather know who I spent the day with   As for all the other answers.............thanks, I needed that   Glen, anytime I can help"
10163,irishfield,2006-12-09 18:28:00,26272,You were having back issues Lew...were you on Flexeril(sp) at the time... LOL I've got weeks I don't remember....
10175,bpsbassman,2006-12-09 18:43:00,941,"Dang, I'd have back issues too if I held up as many Musky as Lew!! How the heck could you forget a fish like that???????"
10181,Rich,2006-12-09 18:57:00,3927, Really? You sound like the kind of fishing partner I need!
10183,wuchikubo,2006-12-09 19:01:00,1114,"Lew, I wish I had that problem of not remembering a musky I've caught.  I'm still working on number 1 as to you and the ####'s  you have caught.  Good luck, hope someone on the board remembers that outing with you."
10190,Handlebarz,2006-12-09 19:29:00,3790,Lew that was July 06 you wanted a pic with my fish how could ya forget that.  Must be nice to have somany great memories you have to delete them for the new ones Lew.
10200,ChrisK,2006-12-09 20:05:00,2772,"Lew, My wife Carol says I have a short term memory(selective)but all us guys know the most important one is the long term memory..... I can honestly say I have never forgotten catching a larger fish........but then again,well uh, I don't get out much either....."
10204,lew,2006-12-09 20:27:00,12767,"Dang, I was hoping to get some support here with lotsa stories of missing brain cells, but now I'm starting to get a complex   I can't be the ONLY one...................................can I ??"
10228,BLACKFISH88,2006-12-09 21:37:00,191,ginko biloba ginko biloba ginko biloba!   LOL just kiddin lew nice fish though!
10291,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-10 01:00:00,621,"ya know Lew,yes there are some moments in time I forget There's always a element that triggers the memory back, just need to find it Most times its within the excitement of the moment you find the element   marc"
10295,Beans,2006-12-10 01:12:00,3339,Can't help you Lew...We only caught bass and crappies the days I went out with you...    Good Times...!!!
10297,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:33:00,90,its awesome that u hae caught so amny musky that u can't remeber what one it is...but try to check the camera properties it might tell u when the picture was taken maybe that will give u a clue
10301,FishFinder,2006-12-10 01:39:00,481,"Youre not alone, lol"
10304,lew,2006-12-10 01:40:00,12767," That was fun times Norm, and do you remember the fish fry that Meeley put on at the end of the day ??    Thanks Jason, but I think it may have been taken with an old 35mm camera that I don't even have anymore, judging from the poor quality of the picture."
10328,Beans,2006-12-10 02:31:00,3339,The fish fry was only the appetizer if I remember rightly...  How about the rest of the meal?  
10349,camillj,2006-12-10 03:21:00,1988,"Lew, Im with ya bud ... I will never forget (I hope) Bill Cosby's line that my brains are in my arse I know that cause when I get up to go do something I get halfway there and frget what it was .. then almost as soon as I sit down again .. I remeber  Anyhow ... here's a question for ya ... when you take someone out in your boat do you  normally sit them at the tiller ? This one looks like you're fishin from the front ... sure you were'nt alone ?   If I had to guess I would say you were right across the lake from BigCliff .. in MY spot !!!!  :D"
