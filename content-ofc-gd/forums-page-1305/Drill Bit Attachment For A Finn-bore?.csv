The trick is not to force the auger.Let the blades cut.  As for BPS,that will be the last 11 bucks I will spend there for awhile.People,know your prices.They are so over priced.  The Pho though was sssssoooooooooooooooooooo good.  Thanks to Fang and Cory and Heather the mrs,s and Terry for a great day."
10238,wuchikubo,2006-12-09 22:13:00,1114,"Misfish, it's called the ""real thang""? The one at BPS is not suggesting to use it except with 4"" or 5"" augers made by strikemaster or polar.  I've got a finn-bore 7"" but that is not recommended.  Clampet, I've tried to google it, the closest thing is called ""ice kicker 2"" at doesn't even mention what it adapts to, however the hole guard looks like an accident waiting to happen.  Anyone else?"
