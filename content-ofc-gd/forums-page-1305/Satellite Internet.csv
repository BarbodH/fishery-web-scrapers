My mom wants to buy my dad satellite internet for Christmas (sometimes it's also called portable internet). Is anyone here using it? How's it working for you? What service are you using (Bell,Rogers etc.). I don't want to do this wrong and end up stuck in a two year contract for something that's useless or unreliable. Thanks in advance."
