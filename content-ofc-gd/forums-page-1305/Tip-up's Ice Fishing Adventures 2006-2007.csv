PLEASE DO NOT PROCEED ONTO THE ICE UNTIL THIS WARM WEATHER PASSES THROUGH THIS WEEK...BY TOMORROW NIGHT, THERE WILL BE NO SAFE ICE ANYWHERE  :cry:  UNFORTUNATLY WE ARE GOING TO JUST HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT GUYS :wink: AGAIN, THE ICE WILL NOT BE SAFE AS OF TONIGHT..BE SMART, BE SAFE...  -Andrew   I could not wait to get this thread started   Thought it might be a bit easier to just keep all my reports under a single thread  No a better feeling than punching that first hole  Might be the last one until after Christmas  Did a little ice check on a few spots in and around Quebec this morning to find nothing but ''Bad'' ice everywhere  :shock: ..Most shorelines were crap and made it impossible to take a step on...Eventually, I found a nice little spot just south of Aylmer that looked as though it could support skinny me and a few items  I drilled my first hole about 8 feet out from shore to find 4'' of clear black ice.. :roll:  Move about another 5 feet and found 3''.... :shock: .. ''Don't walk another step'' I told myself and proceeded back to the car to grab a rod rigged with 2lbs fluro, and a Genz bug with Techni-glo tail...My plans were not to drop a line in the water today, but I could not resist   ..Not expecting anything to show up on the vex, this little guy came up off othe bottom and took a little nip at my jig..bad idea  Wahooo, first fish through the ice this year! A little perch  8)...Stayed for only about 10 minutes then had to go home..Sorry for the really bad shots I took today, I was rushing and my hands were numb..Enjoy     Not bad for an ice check"

10369,trapshooter,2006-12-10 04:06:00,1234,atta boy!  Here's to the first hard water reports of the year!
10372,icewalker28,2006-12-10 04:36:00,39,Great report and pics tip-up. Good to see you played it safe and caught your first hard water fish of the year. Nice Vex!! IW
10553,tip-up,2006-12-10 17:23:00,94,Not too shabby for a little ice check...Hehe
10575,ShaunB,2006-12-10 18:10:00,73,Aw..must have found nice to get that first little bit of ice fishing in.  I can't wait to hit the hard water for some fish but it looks like around here (southern ontario) we will have to be waiting a long while.  Today it is 6 out and this week is supposed to have highs of 10.  Oh well it is definetly worth the wait.  Good job to you!!!!
