9983,ShaunB,2006-12-09 02:05:00,73,I wonder if after tomorrow night there will be yet another loss.  Those Red Wings won't go down without a fight....the leafs just have to do all thier scoring in the third....then maybe they will win
10005,ecmilley,2006-12-09 02:57:00,2163,montreal has a hockey team.....once ther is some safe ice to walk on no ones gonna really care

10132,jediangler,2006-12-09 16:53:00,1923,"I'm worried my BRUINS might go into a slump, they don't play the LEAFS again until New Years Day."
10133,Blake,2006-12-09 17:08:00,418,LOL you guys are great leaf bashers!!!!!!!1
10314,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:48:00,90,leafs are a good team still they just need to trade for someone that can put the puck in the back of the net
10322,trapshooter,2006-12-10 02:11:00,1234,Call the Coroner... THE LEAFS ARE DEAD!!!  It's to the point I actually am starting to feel bad for all you leafs fans.
10475,carll2,2006-12-10 15:37:00,443,GO HABS GO! good game played by the habs last night atleast we take a point
10478,Carp,2006-12-10 15:44:00,1488,"We're so good, we thought it would be a nice festive gesture to let the habs get a head start before wiping the ice with them.  LEAFS NATION RULES THE NHL !!!"
10485,Viscount,2006-12-10 15:50:00,52,"There's still plenty of room on the Sabres bandwagon... hop on, cheer for a winner for once"
