9568,TJQ,2006-12-07 21:35:00,7806, I have arranged for an interview with Karl Kalonka from     It will be in the Jan or Feb issue of the e-magazine.   Anybody got any ideas for questions??   Don't let 'em off easy!!  He looks awful mean....  PLEASE PM ME YOUR QUESTIONS!!  
9576,misfish,2006-12-07 21:56:00,29133,"K Dawg knows his stuff.He is the master of the buckets,JPD Im sure, is a very close second to him.  Way to go TJ."
9595,wishn4fishn,2006-12-07 23:01:00,108,"As a concerned angler I understand the importance of catch and release.  However, if u decide to keep a fish is it beneficial to use a stringer???  I read that as the fish stresses it releases toxins that ruin the texture of the meat.  On occasion i keep trout, I gut and clean them almost immediately to wash the blood residue in the spine.  What's the best way to preserve fresh fish?  I've been wondering and pondering this for a while now. Muchly appreciated, SHoMPZ"

9619,Blake,2006-12-08 01:02:00,418,This is a great opportunity.  Good job TJ.
9722,Reel North,2006-12-08 11:01:00,24,"Ask him about (in gruffy voice) if can do a show beside flippin for bass in trees & around docks......  The show could be called ""extreme flippin docks and trees""  Good job getting an interview though!"
9764,JPD,2006-12-08 14:17:00,296,"Hi Reel North, Hopefully you will get the opportunity to give the show a peek this year as this is the 2nd year that we are focusing on almost everything that the great waters of Ontario have to offer. Here is the list that Karl posted in another thread.   Extreme Angler TV got it's start with Largemouth on Trees and Docks and still is an integral part of the show, kind of like a trademark if you will, however with the new format of Educate, Inspire, and entertain, we have gone out and captured what makes Ontario's fishermen tick!!! Fishing in Ontario is more diverse than most places and it will always be a challenge to cover everything. Hopefully we put a few on film that may interest you.  JPD"
9846,Rich,2006-12-08 19:10:00,3927,"The show is awesome, K-Dawg pulls more huge bass out of docks and trees than I've ever seen in my life! Looking forward to the interview!  Pretty funny though Reelnorth, lol"

Chrispy!"
