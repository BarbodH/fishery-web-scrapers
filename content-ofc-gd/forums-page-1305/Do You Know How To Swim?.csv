10266,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-09 23:08:00,4399,"i learned how to swim the hard way when my uncle threw me into Lake Simcoe when i was young lad, i almost drowned when i was 8 when i got caught in a under tow while swimming in a river saved by a guy who was having a picnic with his family if that fellow would not have seen/heard me i would have been a fish food, that episode never held me back i loved swimming and still do was on the swim team in high school, just got back from the Domincan a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed a week of swimming in the reefs and the ocean surf nothing like swimming in the ocean.  I hate being a newb again!"
10277,GbayGiant,2006-12-09 23:41:00,1780,I can't tred water worth &%^$ but can swim on my back all day long ? I don't know why.
10287,Beans,2006-12-10 00:36:00,3339,I can't remember when I couldn't swim...24 May weekend a few of us would try Lake Ontario down where the Leslie St Spit is now...Damn that water was cold...Then there was BAB up in Taylor's Bush (Lew's territory) by bike after school...  I kinda got back into swimming this year for excercise for my back over at the community pool in town...Dang ...am I ever out of shape...but then again...round is a shape eh?
10336,Joey,2006-12-10 02:43:00,9122,"Yep, as often as I can.  We had a sweet deal going with the neighbors when we were youngins.  Their children had all left home and my parents had us four kids, so they invited us over to swim in their pool to ""keep it clean"" so they didn't have to have it cleaned all the time.  Our swishing and splashing kept it free of alga better than them only swimming in it once a month.  So they were happy and we were really happy.  Then we moved onto other places and Lakes became the swimming holes, plus our cottage up in Minden.  I wouldn't come out until I was a prune  Love it.  Joey"
10343,Daplumma,2006-12-10 03:12:00,1961,"I cant remember ever not being able to swim.I can remember when the shallow end of the pool was 3 ft and over my head.I cant even remember when Art,my younger brother could not swim.We must be some of the origional water babies.Good thread. Joe"
10345,Garyv,2006-12-10 03:13:00,547,"My parents enrolled me in lessons when I was 6 and even though I went, I was still afraid of the water and never passed the first step.  Later that year after I turned 7 we were in Lake Geneva Wisconsin at our cottage when I got up early one morning and was feeding panfish bread off the end of the pier which I wasn't suppose to go on it without an adult nearby.  It rained overnight and the pier was wet and I leaned out to far and fell in 25 ft. of water.  Well I must of learned something from those lessons cause when I popped up I swam the length of the pier to shore....very lucky I guess.  Been swimming ever since and used to spend my summers in Stevensville Michigan where we would go to the lake after breakfast and stay until supper.  Guess I've got older as even though we live by Lake Huron I would prefer to be in a boat, but still swim occasionally."
10346,PatB,2006-12-10 03:15:00,104,"Had to learn to swim when I was a pup, my dad wouldn't let go fishing until I could swim. Did my bronze medalion, life savings 1 & 2, also have my""C"" card for shallow water diving."
10621,douG,2006-12-10 20:56:00,2693,"I'm still a dandy swimmer.  Took the weekday lessons at the Y i Peterborough, and spent Saturday mornings there too doing the Y type activities they had.  As a teen, I would swim up and down the Otonnabee all afternoon.  I  think we all should know how to swim.   I got knocked off the dock at Lakair once by a freight train.  Even tho I knew I would be ok in the water,  my life still flashed in front of me.  What a sobering experience that was.  Well, almost sobering."
10624,MuskyBill,2006-12-10 21:00:00,311,"Yup, all my life.  My Mom used to say I should've been born a fish, because I was either swimming, or fishing, all the time."
10625,Cookslav,2006-12-10 21:01:00,1457,"Yuppers... I had a pool growing up, and spent many of summer vacations swimming in Huron at my Granparents Cottage.  I second the notion that those who can't swim should either learn or stay away from water?  If I couldn't I think I'd be afraid to be any were near deep water?"
10627,nelly,2006-12-10 21:08:00,256," Thank you for all the replies. I did try to attempt a poll but somehow mess up. I did enjoy some of your terms like river rat, tadpole, and waterbug. I guess the secret is to learn while your young. Garyv and Lookinforwalleye, consider yourself very luck. Swimming is freedom."
10156,nelly,2006-12-09 18:13:00,256,"I was wondering how many people knew how to swim since most of us enjoy been on the water and the outdoors. Myself, just alittle. True but sad. Maybe I should take up swimming and get more exercise."
10160,irishfield,2006-12-09 18:21:00,26272,River rat here...grew up with the Rideau in the back yard. We swam all day as kids...then after hours moved our venue to the town pool where we could use the diving boards without lifeguards hassling us.
10162,Greencoachdog,2006-12-09 18:26:00,8163,Yup! Been swimmin' since I was a tadpole! I prefer the ocean for swimmin' though.
10165,Rich,2006-12-09 18:34:00,3927,Yep.
10169,huntervasili,2006-12-09 18:36:00,1604,Sure do...
10171,dsn,2006-12-09 18:37:00,1018,yep I do too.
10173,lew,2006-12-09 18:39:00,12767,"Yup, learned to swim about the same time I learned to walk, just the way I taught my own kids.  Never could understand why folks don't teach the kids how to swim as soon as possible, specially if the kids are around the water at all or in a boat. If they can't teach it themselves,  there are lessons given by the Red Cross or other like groups that wouldn't cost too much.  Every weekend we hear about kids drowning and in most cases, it was probably avoidable.  Nothing makes me madder than to see kids who can't swim, playing in the water with those stupid inflatible things around their upper arms while Mom & Dad lay on the beach more concerned with getting a suntan than the welfare of their children."
10176,fishindevil,2006-12-09 18:45:00,6254,"grew up swimming in pigeon lake ,and about 10yrs old my parents bought a 16x 32 in-ground pool it was awsome all sumer iwas either swimmin or fishin ...being a kid was great"
10178,BrownTown,2006-12-09 18:50:00,103,"swimming is freedom...i wish i had a pool, id be one health IQ challenged!"
10179,wuchikubo,2006-12-09 18:52:00,1114,"Sadly, not any more.  I had taken classes when I was a young child, once in high school. I can't seem to stay afloat without assistance. Even when I relax in water I sink, heavy boned.  Thus, I always wear my PFD on the water regardless how ridiculus I may look."
10180,kennyman,2006-12-09 18:52:00,737,"Love to swim. Took lots of lessons growing up and my kids are doing the same. My parents have had a pool for the last fifteen years (my kids pretty much learned to swim there). I've always loved the water. I've been canoeing for the past couple years and always wanted a (real) boat but have never had one. I guess it only makes sense that I eventually started to fish, I just can't believe it took me this long to find this hobby. There's just something about the water that is undescribable. It's very calming.There's something inherantly right about being near it, almost like you belong there. Man that was a longwinded answer. Sorry..... yes I swim (LOL)."
10210,OhioFisherman,2006-12-09 20:39:00,6623,"Ya I can, been swimming since childhood, more of a floater now the energy is gone."
10211,Bob,2006-12-09 20:49:00,370,"Yep, and I hate to say for how many years.  I even had some lifeguard training many many moons ago."
10215,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-09 21:02:00,0,Yep.  I did take lessons when I was really young but kind of taught myself as I got older.
10226,Deano,2006-12-09 21:35:00,767,"swim like a fish, funny no one caught me yet, well except the wife."
10236,Rich Clemens,2006-12-09 22:06:00,3131,"Been swimmin' for many many years.   Learned at the local YMCA and later on in me youth, our neighbors had a nice in-ground pool, which saw a lot of activity in the summer months.   Don't do some much any more ... I prefer to stay in the boat"
10240,SlowPoke,2006-12-09 22:16:00,2984,I know how to swim but I don't like not being able to see bottom... pools are okay. It never used to bother me as I spent my misspent youth swinging from ropes into Bronte Creek.  -Brian
10243,Rizzo,2006-12-09 22:21:00,4754,"no doubt, used to go out and swim for a half hour straight out in the lake, then 45 minutes back in!"
10244,mepps,2006-12-09 22:23:00,1301,"I dont have the best form, but I grew up in the ocean..."
10245,misfish,2006-12-09 22:27:00,29133,"My pop was a water bug.He had us in the water as soon as a life jacket would fit us.He did the butterfly stroke like no one I had ever seen.I was young then, but he was my pop.LOL  It was the first swimming style I learned.At age ten, I was able to swim without a jacket.That was pops rule,until you can tread water for 2 miniutes and swim from the rock to the dock,I be wearing that life jacket.Not a very cool thing to be wearing with the other good looking 9/10 year old girls around.HEHE."
10247,Tdel,2006-12-09 22:33:00,393,Usually spent everyday swimming.  Can't really remember when I couldn't swim.  I do remember being very young and doing the dog paddle.   My aunt decided to teach me how to swim the proper way on that day.   After that I had no fear of the water or depth.  Tom
10249,Pigeontroller,2006-12-09 22:35:00,2793,"Learned at 7 months, before I could walk...  I honestly don't think a person that can't swim should be in a boat!"
10250,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 22:38:00,933,"i learned when i was 12 or so, love swimmin now, especially snorkeling in the Adriatic Sea, ahhh nothing is nicer! I got a certificate, ,maybe i can dig it up."
10255,misfish,2006-12-09 22:40:00,29133," That will open a whole discusion my friend.Thats why they made PFD,s.  I agree with you on a certian point here,swimming would be a great asset,but .................................  Whats with the sad spell check system here.I know I suck at spelling and really dont care what others think,but it would be nice to have one that does work."
10258,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 22:46:00,933," Ur right on that msfish, this is already opening up a whole new discussion lol, r u really gonna rely on a jacket? who knows what could go wrong. With these new kinds where u pull the cord, that could go south on u. cord could be stuck or u cant find it in time. i agree with pigeontroller."
