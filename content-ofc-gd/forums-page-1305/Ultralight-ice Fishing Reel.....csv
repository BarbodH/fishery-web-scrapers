9806,Blake,2006-12-08 16:10:00,418,"Go with the Stradic 6:1 29"" 7.9 OZ  6 LB/110 YDS ST1000FH.  This reel would be great for what you want but also could be used for other species as well. If you want to go smaller in size look at the Shimano Symetre with 4.7:1, 22"", 6.9OZ 4 LB/120 YDS 4+1 BEARINGS SY750FI"
9812,trapshooter,2006-12-08 16:31:00,1234,I own 3 stradic's and love them.  Great reel for the buck.  If you have the $$$ and want one for ice fishing then go for it... you won't regret it.
