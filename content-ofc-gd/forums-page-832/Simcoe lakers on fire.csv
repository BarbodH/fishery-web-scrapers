Only had 3 hours to fish, so we stayed in KBay and looked for fish in 75-90 fow and marked more clusters in 84-87 feet so we anchored and started there.  Kelli started off with a buckshot spoon and me with a tube.  In 10 minutes I had two fish in the boat, about 3 and 4 pounds.  Both fish followed the tube up to about 40 feet before hitting.  After another 3 pounder, Kelli made the switch to a tube and immediately picked one up by yo yoing the tube.  The action died for about a half hour and I was hanging my tube 55 feet down over 86 feet when a big streak went vertical to my tube and the chase was on, the fish caught its prey and I set the hook into the heaviest fish I've felt in a while.  She immediately turned and headed back to the depths peeling drag.  As I went to loosen my drag, snap.  I never got a look at her, but she was a HEAVY fish.  Too bad, I'll get her next time.  In 3 hours, we landed 8 lakers and lost another 4 or 5.  The action is heating up again, should be good for a while still.
