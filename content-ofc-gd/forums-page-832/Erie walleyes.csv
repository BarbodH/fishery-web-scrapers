Many were in the 20-22"" range with a number over 25 which were released. The biggest of the day was a healthy 27.5"", that was CPR'd. The fishing in the are has been great for the last month and will continue most of the summer. Finding active fish on such a large body is the only issue. We ran crawler harnesses in various colours, with the clearer water the baitfish image blades were working best. Open water downrigging out of Wheatley for steelhead is just around the corner and this makes for some high flying action. Some of that action can be seen on WFN. Musky season is now open and the short period of casting-jigging is winding down, but the trolling season will be hitting full stride as the fish move off the spawning grounds to the open water on Lake St. Clair. The musky casting will return in Oct for those interested.   "
