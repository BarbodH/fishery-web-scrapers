On my boat I mounted cooks tackle orginizers under two of the hatches- these thing are great i hang all my spinner/buzzbaits and pitchen jigs on them with the pack of shower rings I hang bags of plastics .  I also mounted retractable rod straps on my boat again very good product as the rod locker in a older 18ft ranger isn't good for much other than safety equipment (or i go back to 6ft rods) had the boat in some very bad water and no problems like them much better than my velcro rod savers.  berkley amp rod- for 35 bux had to try it, one piece it's light and senstive but a little wippy not much backbone i use it for lindy rigging works good in that app for me  rapala type-R 7'2"" trigger mh rod- ok this has to be the value rod of the year it's feels everybit as good as any of my crucials or carrot stixs, st.croix and it's $90  put a new abu garcia revo sx in use wow what a reel 11 bearing smooth as silk and casts like a bullit it feels everybit as good as my chronarchs but a bit heavier with a quicker spool.  for lures the only real new thing for me is Strike Zone Dart worms played with these in a tank can't wait to drop shot these for some buckets."
