352405,n8tivebigguy,2009-06-16 03:28:00,30,Hi i was just wondering if there was any decent spots to fish from shore in long point. I usually go to port rowan but was just checking to see if there was any other spots? I would appreciate the suggestions and help. Thanks

If you are willing to bring a set of waders there is a network of dredged channels and duck hunting ponds from the causeway on out to the end of the prov park on the bayside. Bring up google maps and you will see the channels and a lot of dredged rectangular ponds that are used for duck hunting blinds in season, fish these, it is hard slogging at times but there is a lot of pike , largemouth bass, crappie and bluegills."
