353141,GBW,2009-06-18 03:16:00,8460,"what reel, line and so forth would help.  I have caught pike on MH 6'6"" MH rod's but the rest of the gear set's the stage as welll..."
353143,pike slayer,2009-06-18 03:19:00,1177,"oh ya your fine unless your out for big momma pike. i normally use a shimano 6'6"" medium fast action with 10lb mono and 2500 series reel. the biggest pike i got on that setup was 15lb. i've got alot of 5-12lbers on that setup also. you'll be fine and you'll have more of a fun time reeling in the big one"
353159,Roninramirez,2009-06-18 04:56:00,19,"It all depends on the size of lure you fishing with 3/8oz or 1oz or heaver. You will have trouble casting bigger baits. The heaver the lure the bigger the fish. Don't get it wrong, small lures will catch big fish. Its just more often you will catch 5-10lber. I have landed 20+ channel cats on my 6'6 mh Shimano Compre fine.  tight lines"

353331,steverowbotham,2009-06-18 22:00:00,1800,"Early season pike, when I've throwing smaller baits, I still use a lot of spinning gear, you should be fine"
