352766,Rich,2009-06-17 03:03:00,3927,"Sugarpacket and I decided to hit a spot that has become Urban Fisherman's home waters in previous years. So since he's had my boat anchor since last fall and well we really haven't had a chance to visit him we stopped off at his house first. After some fishing discussion he drew us a fake map of where the giant DC carp were supposed to be. This detailed map was definitely a fraudulent attempt at keeping us from catching the fish he prefers to keep to himself.  As we were leaving he says ""make sure you take lots of pictures today guys"" which is where I remember I didn't bring the camera. Luckily the fishing was lacking enough that pictures would have consisted mostly of scenery.  So we waste a crapload of battery power (no gas motors allowed) getting to this fabricated carp spot and see no carp, hear no carp and catch no carp. Did see a bunch of big bass up there though.. hmmmmmm.....  Anywho the day was not a waste as the true reason to get out was to bring home a good snack of panfish. First fish in the cooler of death (which has undergone some recent upgrades) was a decent 13 inch perch. Bluegills which are usually huge and plentiful there were virtually non-existent and we ended up with only one keeper. Luckily our WGSF catching skills did not lack and we got a few decent ones to bring home. If you ain't tried WGSF yet (rock bass for those of you who are not die hard fans of me) you really are missing out. They are probably my favourite panfish to eat. So we got exactly what we were looking for, a half dozen fish to bring home for a meal. Not to mention about a billion 12 inch OOS largemouth (which of course were released).  As Sugarpacket brings the Filth-150 down to the boat ramp for our triumphant exit we notice a rattling noise. Power steering isn't working. She checks power steering fluid.. lots there. We load up the boat. Check again. One of the tension wheels for the fanbelt busted right off. Yeaahhhh... so we had an 80 dollar escort back home. We travel in style.. though I think next time we'll just spring for the limo.  All in all it was an interesting day. No huge fish stories to tell, just the sighting of some very big bass that will surely be nowhere near where we saw them in a week and a half.  Just another day fishin.    "
352783,Bassaholic,2009-06-17 04:09:00,74,"Nice report. That's a good perch for that lake. I always did much better with crappie there than I ever did on perch. I love a good feed of rock bass too, I dont know why people look down on them so much. Tough luck about the truck though. That ended up being quite an expensive feed of rock bass. I cant wait to hit that place up for bass as soon as it opens. There's definately some big fish in there and its a fun lake to fish. Keep the reports coming."
352791,Sugarpacket,2009-06-17 05:00:00,82,"now now rich we saw one carp out there or was that on the way there? oh yeah i remember that was just a picture of urban holding a carp! lol it was good times maybe we can get him to show us next time or bring the ""map"" with us."
352829,Greencoachdog,2009-06-17 12:19:00,8163,I've always found that is someone gives you a map or marks spots on a map for you... always try the opposite end or shore of the lake and you'll usually find their honey holes!
