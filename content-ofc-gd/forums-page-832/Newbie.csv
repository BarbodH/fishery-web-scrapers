I went to center island for pike last week. didn't catch any.....got couple monster size followed.....but they were just teasing me.....sad Went to Bluffers park on Monday, same situation ....just follow, no action at all....some of them just sit there watching the bait swim by.....wondering what's happening to those pikes.....>:|  Cheers, Jackie"
353118,Big Cliff,2009-06-18 01:47:00,6899,Hi Jackie and welcome to the board!  When pike follow and don't hit; fish faster! They are interested just not excited!  Pike are agressive!
353127,Jackie,2009-06-18 02:12:00,124,  NO WONDER......i was retrieving slower and slower thinking that they might bite it because the bait is dying.....LOL. thank you so much for the tip buddy!
