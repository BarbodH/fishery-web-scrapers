353016,lilkynan,2009-06-17 21:47:00,173,My Tachometer is not working?? - what can I do to test the guage to decide to replace it - also the starter switch is not always engaging - what up with these things??? - 2003 Bayliner - was sticking a bit last year - now is not moving at all. Also the key needs to be turned a few times before the starter kicks in. Why is this happening and what can I do to fix and prevent this?
