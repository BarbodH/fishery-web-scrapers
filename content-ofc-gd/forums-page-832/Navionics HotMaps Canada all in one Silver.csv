352687,Double What??,2009-06-17 00:11:00,29,"Hi all,  Can anyone confirm that the Navionics ""HotMaps Canada all in one Silver"" will work correctly in Humminbird 798?  Also, does anyone know what this map offers vs. the other Navionics maps that are available for Canada?  I didn't see anything at all about these ""Silver"" maps on the Navionics site or on HBird.  Any help will be appreciated.  Cheers,  Double WHAT??  a.k.a. Henry Jr"

352857,yo_guy,2009-06-17 13:43:00,111,Perhaps contacting Navionics so you can be absolute certain that it will work or better yet contact a retailer who carries the chip like BPS and maybe Lebarons.
