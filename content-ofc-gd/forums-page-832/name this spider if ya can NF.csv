352614,JohnF,2009-06-16 20:37:00,3494,Alien?  JF
352615,Terry,2009-06-16 20:41:00,14456,Orb Weaver or Garden Spider  
352623,Fishnwire,2009-06-16 20:51:00,983,Let it bite you.  You might get spidey-powers.
352630,rbaquial,2009-06-16 21:02:00,968, LMAO!  Either that.... or get sick!
352633,wuchikubo,2009-06-16 21:08:00,1114,"Interesting looking spider, the closest thing I came up with googling was the male orchard spider:  "
352635,Joey,2009-06-16 21:14:00,9122,I believe Terry is correct.  I've seen those garden spiders before.  They can get pretty big.  Joey
352636,joonmoon,2009-06-16 21:20:00,528,"She's a very nice specimen of the Garden Spider variety, have some in our gardens too. They are harmless, but have a large web and dazzling color patterns. I find them really cool as far as the arachnids genus goes. "
352648,aplumma,2009-06-16 21:57:00,6896,"Take two of them orally with a glass of water.... o wait I'm sorry that is what it said on the medicine bottle. The answer ""garden spider is correct.   Art"
352667,Handlebarz,2009-06-16 23:06:00,3790,here is a pic like the one I have out here I dont think the one Terry posted is the same as this one the back of it looks like something that it is carrying and it has all bright colors my son chased it away before i could get a better pic maybe it will be back tomorrow.  http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http...mOMTE_Qa2k93HDQ  
352668,Greencoachdog,2009-06-16 23:13:00,8163,Boris!!!  
352717,Daplumma,2009-06-17 01:06:00,1961,If it were my spider I would call her Ophelia.I just like that name.If it was a boy maybe Percy Rasputan Farthing.
352729,cram,2009-06-17 01:42:00,1733,You should try this on it...  
352730,backbay,2009-06-17 01:43:00,773,Toby Mcguire?

352843,dannyboy,2009-06-17 12:57:00,367,Orchard spider  Dan
352865,rromberg,2009-06-17 13:59:00,10,"Its real name is ""black and yellow argiope"" beautiful but harmless."
352894,wuchikubo,2009-06-17 15:46:00,1114, If that's the picture of it I'm sticking with my guess of Orchard Spider (looks 99.9% like it)  So what did I win?
