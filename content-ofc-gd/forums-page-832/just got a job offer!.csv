352727,holdfast,2009-06-17 01:39:00,1813," Just to Prove a Point Big Boy.  Watch who you Mock.  You should hope that if you have a son, you should be proud that he gives to his Country.  I hope you at least instill some attributes in him like Honor and Integrity as well as Sense of Duty.  Each medal ( Including the one with the 2/Tours)  to me is a Sacrifice that I did for at least Six months away from my wife and kids if you think doing it for your country is to Candy AAss a thing to do    I am taking the fuses out of a TMA 3 Antitank mine.  They have 3 fuses as you can see.  If one doesn't work, surly the others will.    All these mines which I helped unbury and Pile as well as rig to explode, will no longer hurt anyone including innocent kids.    This is the fun part as long as nothing has happened up to this point.  Its to rig them up with C4 to blast them so No Croat or Bosnian or Serbian will ever use them again.    We called our selves the Lost Boys.  As no one in Canada had a clue that we were in Iraq Clearing Mines and unexploded Ordnance.  These guys are my section of young Canadian Kids that would spit on you if you ever mocked what they did or that they were serving their Country.  I'm the guy with the shirt on.  We are all Combat Soldiers.  The Hardest physically and mentally job in the Military.  Everything we do is dangerous.  We Clear Mines Booby traps, IEDs, Build and explode Roads, Bridges, Buildings etc etc    And a cool story I had posted way back.  The RCMP were approached in Serbia claiming to be a sister of a Canadian Combat Engineer World War 2 vet.  This guy fought for Canada during the 2nd war and decided to stay and fight for his motherland Yugoslavia.  she wanted to know if he was entitled to anything.  My RSM Contacted the legion and sure enough the found his records and here we are pinning Canadian War medals owing to him.  We did this under the Guise as doing humanitarian work to get into the Serb side.  On Remembrance day we invited him to our camp to see the ceremony on the Croat side.  He Spoke absolutely no English.  is that cool or what  "
352734,Double What??,2009-06-17 01:55:00,29,holdfast....   Thanks man.
352735,RuNnYoOzE,2009-06-17 01:59:00,270,...basically it boils down to  this..Boss's are just that a Boss..he treats his employees harsh ..alot do but survival mode kicks in and like a kick in the nuts ..extra money for a Sunday Morning Drive is worth It !!!!
352737,pike slayer,2009-06-17 02:06:00,1177,"So i showed up this morning and the boss didn't say to much and basically just told me to go along with one of his guys. we are building this kind of gazebo and they had already put 6x6s in the ground then we had to put 6x6s around it and fill it with sand dust or whatever you call the stuff that you put under brick. the guy is like wanna cut the 6x6 and i was like sureee, i go to the truck get the circular saw and hes like no no no use the chainsaw and i was like oooooo k and hacked it to length. then from 9am-2pm i basically watched him level one 6x6 which sits on the ground between 2 posts haha what a joke! i kept giving him tips and asking if i could help and he kept shrugging me off and kept complaining saying theres something wrong with this level but with a lot more swearing in there. So far this place seems to be a real bush league. Last night i got an email from a plumbing company in town asking me if i wanted to renovate the new office and i emailed him back seeing if after theres a good chance of getting permanent work from him because hes mainly plumbing but he does full bathroom renovations and he has a couple carpenters on his crew. when i got home from work today he said if i do a good job on the reno theres a very good chance of permanent job and they hes looking into getting some kinda wage subcities. so i hope to hear back from him soon. i talked to him about work last year but fell through and he has a very good reputation and i had a good little poop chat with him and hes huge into fishing like i am so like come on he has to be a good guy. It seems like its feast or famine for work, theres a dry spell for a while now i have options geeeez!!"

I gotta go away for a month, wanna look after the place while I'm gone. Its a welding shop. I said, sure, whats it pay. He says, what do you want. I told him and he said OK. After the month I says, how can I keep this job. He said, find enough work to keep you busy. I started bidding jobs that came up, worked part time for a month, picked up a couple jobs.

Unemployment Insurance should be used if you cannot Get a Job.  I REPEAT cannot get a Job. Not a crutch to get a better job or more comfortable Quality of Life.  Welfare or whatever you call it now.  Should only be used if you have no other avenues for income ie.. your Retarded, Disabled, and I mean Disabled.  Not as a crutch to Pop Kids, Runaway from home, Quit School, Drink Beers, Wait for a better job, turn down jobs you don't like.  As for my thoughts, Take the job sniffles, suck it up, get off social assistance as I'm not paying you to choose jobs.  Get off your  ASS Last thing-- I think you should be on UnEmployment say 4 months, Then your Drafted into the Army to do weeknds as during the week your looking for a job..  See how many guys end up at Timmies or working two jobs at minimum Wage."
352345,Dara,2009-06-16 00:49:00,3052,"   The rules say ""cannot get a job equal to what you were paying the insurance for"" You going to let your insurance company give you a Kia when you wreck your mercedes, even though the policy you were forced to buy said you would get a mercedes?   Unemployment insurance isn't social assistance. You have to work to get it"
352350,holdfast,2009-06-16 00:57:00,1813, One thing I hate is Barrack Room Lawyers.  Stop comparing Social Assistance to car Insurance.  Me and my working neighbor Pays for you to get Welfare or Unemployment.  SOCIAL ASSISTANCE

You don't become a Master Commercial Construction Carpenter by being wimpy, you will work for some asses and some good people... you will learn from both!"
352352,Dara,2009-06-16 01:07:00,3052,"  When they stop taking the premiums off my cheque every week.  Welfare is in your taxes and goes to anybody that doesn't want to or can't work. Insurance gets you through the tough spots. It used to pay a heck of a lot better than it does now. When everybody was out of work in the 80's recession the government had to pay out of taxes to cover what they had promised. They cut benefits back and raised premiums. Now it makes money,and they spend it on other things,,,same as GM spending pension money, and thats not what it is supposed to do. Bussiness owners don't pay it, and they don't collect it. Its a working mans insurance. If we can't use it, we shouldn't have to pay it.  That kid works hard, and he is going to work for what could be an idiot employer. Why should he have to put up with that guys crap when he paid into a system that gives him an option not to while he finds a real employer"
352355,holdfast,2009-06-16 01:18:00,1813," Obviously our Social programs need some rethinking and Overhauling ( Stricter).  By the way he is assuming that he is an Idiot Employer.  Unless you cannot find a job, you are abusing the System.  An abuser of the System is a parasite for those of us that are working and paying into it."

The only thing to keep tabs on is if he pays you on time, if he doesn't pay you on your agreed time and date, then leave as fast as you can.

Yes there is some people out there at ride the system till it runs out then they go look for work but thats not me and thats not what this topic is about. I also never plan on going into the army, i don't care how much they are paying me, i'd rather go to jail then be sent over to the middle east if they tried to draft me or something. this was about if i should work for a prick employer or not. and im going in at 8am tomorrow morning and see how it goes."

I rather serve to be Free.  - I would never-ever ask the public should I take a job or stay on Social Assistance.  To me its a no Brainer- Get off the Social assistance.  Anyways I grew up that is a last resort and not to be proud of  - I did take unemployment as a young feller in Quebec, but I also moved to work/ Calgary/ worked/ then joined the Military in Calgary.  I was not proud to be on Social assistance but I did take the first job offered./ Bagging Patatoes for min Wage. -  Good for you my young friend, glad to see you sacrafice yourself to work for a prick employer than maybe do time for your country.  But I bet given the choice, Military weeknds with social assistance, you would not be asking your embarrising question on a public forum where some of us have dealt with a heluv alot more stress than your decision to stay on social assistance or work for an Idiot boss that you assume to be.  Next time use your head besides seperating your ears.  Good luck on your job and after a week PM me and tell me how your Boss is, maybe I can help you deal with it.  Ive dealt with alot worse.   Tidbit Hows this for stress--  You are tasked to make sure a road is clear of mines outside a village in Serbia.  You know there are mines there as the fields are left un-cultivated.  You have the mine record from the Serbians that says they layed seven mines.  You look and look but only find six.  You and your Section even look farther than what the recorder tells ya.  Still only six of seven found.  You go back to your Commander and he asks.  IS THE ROAD CLEAR.  You say well we only found six of seven mines.  Commander is pissed and asks you IS THE ROAD CLEAR.  I say yes knowingly OUR Infantry will use that same road that night to patrol ensuring there is no military operations going on between the warring factions.  DID I SLEEP you think.  This goes on everyday in Afghanistan.  Dr. HOLDIE"

352494,Jonny,2009-06-16 14:38:00,1380,"I don't think it was an 'embarrassing' question, and obviously it gave some people a highly desirable opportunity to weigh in with their opinions.  I think it gave wormdangler a chance to ask an important question to some people whose opinions he obviously respects.  I also think it was a sort of ""thinking out loud"" thing - trying to sort through some issues.  There's no stigma to accepting EI if you really need it. What we all abhor is people who play the system. There's not so much resistance to having the program im the first place for people who are forced to use it, despite their work ethic. We wouldn't have the program if there were a hue and cry from the general voting public about it being available .  I paid into EI all my working career with no chance of ever collecting, but I know some friends and relatives who have done so, and I don't begrudge that --- except for a few who I know leaned on it more than they should have."
352501,Lunker777,2009-06-16 14:59:00,866," Dude, Thats great you served in the army.... but don't hold yourself on a high horse for it. There are plenty more where you came from. We are all thankful for our soldiers. I respect EVERYONE of them for what they do because I couldn't even imagine the level of danger and stress they go through on a day to day basis when on the lines. I've talked to one returned soldier about what it was like over there and he said to me...""try being the most scared you have EVER been in your life... times it by 10, and then feel that all day long every day"" ....... Wow.  Stop calling it ""Social Assistance"" You make it sound like something bad, the topic is EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE..... I get money taken off my check every week to pay for my EI if I were to lose my job. I don't consider it ""Riding the system"" if I had to make the choice.... If I knew the guy was a prick, I would keep looking myself to possibly find a better job.Im sure the offer would still be on the table down the road if it come to HAVING to work for the guy.... AND If he is that much of a prick, Im sure there would be open positions pretty regularly. If wormdangler said he was on welfare and couldn't decide to give up smokin crack with 6 babies in the house or go to work... then yes, I would say Get off your   . I live in Chatham, ONT.... if you have ever been here, it is the model it seems for people ""riding the system"" ...It actually makes me red in the face when I see the disgusting welfare rats walking the streets looking for there next fix or riding there 10 speed to the beer store with 2 cases of lucky on the bars. Its absolutley BRUTAL !!!  Im sure I wouldn't see wormdangler doing that in his home town... Ive worked for a bad boss before... 1 year... 24 people hired and fired.... Save yourself the wasted time... because, like in my case... it could turn you off the career all together ! Be careful ! GOOD LUCK Wormdangler !"

352607,Fishnwire,2009-06-16 20:26:00,983,"I've paid the maximum amount into EI for at least the last ten years, and have never seen a dime come back to me.  I'm laid off right now, and after my vacation weeks are exhausted, and I am eligible to collect benefits, I plan on doing so.  Anyone who would try to tell me I should be ""ashamed"" of that is way off base.  I'll leave it at that.  Secondly, people shouldn't feel obligated to work for companies who they know to be poor employers any more than companies should be obligated to hire people who they know to be poor employees.  Maybe if the apprentice told the potential employer, ""Look, I need the work but your reputation as far as how you treat your employees is poor."" then maybe the employer would take some time to think about how he does business.  Maybe he would decide he lacks some of the inter-personal skills required to successfully manage employees."
352626,JohnF,2009-06-16 20:54:00,3494,"  A couple of thoughts - 1. No one need be ashamed of claiming EI. You've paid into it just like I used to pay into an income protection plan ""just in case'. The only difference is that mine was voluntary and yours isn't. 2. EI should not be confused with social assistance. The folks who receive that haven't contributed in advance, at least not in a structured plan. And there's no shame in needing to fall back on any kind of social assistance either. It's one of the benefits of living in a progressive society.  The only folks who should be embarrassed, and of course they're the last ones who are, are those who think that it's okay to abuse the system and make no effort to be self supporting any longer than they really need to be. Society owes you nothing except the opportunity to live your life with pride. But you have to earn the right to be proud. If through no fault of your own your life is in financial disarray, then ask for help. That's what it's there for, and as quickly as you can fix your own problems.  3. There's probably no point in trying to give object lessons to the employer in question. He probably prides himself on being a jerk. Go figger. 4. If you're in a small community there's more to be considered than just having a job. If you're an up and coming tradesperson who expects to build a career in your chosen trade in that small community you need to think twice about who you associate yourself with and how the association will affect the impression you make. Will you be tarred by his brush? In a large impersonal community it's just about the pay cheque, the bad stuff won't get stuck to you, and who knows, you might even learn some things about how not to run your business in the future. 5. Finally, if the employer is that much of a jerk, do you trust him not to stiff you, or make you the scapegoat for his transgressions? That comes back to the small town dilemma.  Good luck with your future. If you really want it, there are lots of routes that lead to success. Rolling in the mud with pigs is often not one of them unless you're chosen career is in the slaughterhouse business, and I can tell you from experience, the pigs don't care what kind of character you have.

So he just called me this morning and asked if i found a job yet and i told him no and that im still looking and hes like alrite well come to the shop tomorrow and i can put you to work! Now this guy here has a really bad reputation around town and i don't know how this guy even has work!

352210,Dara,2009-06-15 17:42:00,3052,"  I resent that.  The government is trying to make EI shamefull.  EI stands for Employment Insurance. When it was started it was called Unemployment Insurance. INSURANCE. It is mandatory to pay into it. It is to help you, kinda like a savings account, for when you are unlucky enough to be out of work. It helps people get established in their chosen field. Gives them a bit of money between jobs to work and move up the ladder to permanent employment. It changed to EI after mulroneys recession when the government didn't want to pay out the benefits after they took the premiums from the working man. The fund is loaded with money now and the government is using it as a source of income instead of giving it back to the policy holders when they need it most. Living on welfare for an able bodied man is shamefull, collecting EI when you are between jobs is like letting the insurance company pay off an accident claim. Do you tell your insurance to just skip it when you wreck your car?"
352221,ldub,2009-06-15 18:19:00,9,Well said Dara. the only time I would say it's shamefull is the people that make sure they only work just enough hours so they can collect EI . Anyone can run into hard luck and have to rely on the Government while getting back going and there's nothing wrong with that. ldub
352228,Beats,2009-06-15 18:43:00,543,"Given the option to work, I say take it.  I work in renovations and haven't worked much at all this year.  I also don't get the option to collect EI, so just know that there are ppl out there that would give anything just to work at the moment.   I don't think it's shameful to collect EI, but if the option to work instead is there, I would opt to work."

352248,Headhunter,2009-06-15 19:43:00,5703,Doh! Not that there's anything wrong with that! I've got to read what I post before I post it I guess! HH
352255,Roy,2009-06-15 19:56:00,13728,"Joe, I hope Gerritt and Bernie didn't read that."
352259,Terry,2009-06-15 20:03:00,14456,LOL.........now that's funny   but  I find when I am working I get lots of job offers when out of work offers are few and far between suck it up take the job then size him up if a better offer comes along grab it....  or stay on ie and fish fish fish
352261,bushart,2009-06-15 20:05:00,2628, Man I never caught that on the first pass...May want to re-think your user name at this juncture  Bushart
352262,pikehunter,2009-06-15 20:05:00,1659,"Give it a try. Nothing to lose is there?  I went through what you are feeling several years ago. The company and the owner had a reputation that proceeded him like a parade. I took the chance and made a little money, but I was always looking over my shoulder and was always apprehensive which was very unfortunate. If I had let my personal opinions hide themselves in my the far reaches of my mind and memory I would have done better in sales, made a lot more money and would have enhanced my own reputation for succeeding so well under such circumstances. Another possibility is that I could have pursued was to have confronted him with all I knew of his history (after getting started) and see what the results would have been. After all, I really had nothing to lose, right? And I would have gotten a lot off my chest after giving him the opportunity to discuss the situation. It would have not been pleasant to bring the matter forward but at least everything would have been out in the open, I would have some answers that were both truth and fiction but any answers to concerns that put your mind at ease are good.  Let go of your feelings and go for it. Like Bobby McFarren sang in his song...""Don't Worry, Be Happy."""
352273,pike slayer,2009-06-15 20:57:00,1177,"ya i guess i'll give it a go and see what happens, i dont have much to loose and the pay is better then EI. The day after i got layed off i went down to job connect to see what they had to offer and there was postings for 4-5 different carpentry related job postings but they do not tell you who the employer is which really grinds my gears cause i know whos good in this town and whos not and well the next morning at 7am i get a call from a contractor asking to come in cause he really needs a guy and i asked who it was and he told me his name and as soon as he did i hung up the phone haha, i wanted nothing to do with that guy and i would rather sit on my butt making little money on EI then work for this guy. i sure hope that this opportunity is better then that guy and he said that my hours will count towards my apprenticeship working for him so thats the main reason why i'm going. i've had some pretty bad jobs in the past and im sure this one can't be worse then those. and it is true when you are sitting at home you do not get many offers even for side work but as soon as your working you gotta start turning ppl away. I just can't wait till i finally get my apprenticeship done and get my ticket so i can have alot more doors open for opportunities and somewhere that i actually want to work and for a long time, i find it really tough completing an apprenticeship if you dont have the right hook ups."
352278,Tybo,2009-06-15 21:29:00,1373,"WHAT; Summer is on the way.And you already collecting your EI. Take the summer off, Let sum other poor slob bust a nut. You have your entire life in front of you too be responsible."
352315,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-06-15 23:49:00,0,"   Slowpoke nailed it right on, youll look better to a prospective employer if your working as aposed to not working."
352324,Greencoachdog,2009-06-16 00:11:00,8163,  Yer such a pain in the ass Pokey!  ... but you almost got this one right.  Go to work!... keep looking while you're working for this guy in case you need another job.  Sometimes the hardest people to work for are the best people to work for!... as you get older you'll see what I mean.
352329,charlied,2009-06-16 00:20:00,584,"I personally would not work for someone you know is a prick already, you will not enjoy working for someone like that.  I would say collect your EI, look into the second career strategy with the Ontario Government and choose a different field or career.  But choose wisely if you do!  Once your EI runs out then there is additional funding for the second career that would kick in.  this way you can really commit yourself to school 100%. I wouldn't listen to anyone saying suck it up and get off EI, thats why you pay into it.  It's not like your one of those low life's abusing the system!  Let the system work for you!"
