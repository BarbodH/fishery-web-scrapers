I have 2 batteries hooked up on a switch with an automatic charging isolator, last year I had no issues with the system.  Ive checked the batteries, Ive switched the charging isolator, checked the connections. everything seems fine.  even when I disconnect one battery, the charger still thinks the other battery is full.  should I look at the onboard charger itself? Do they pooch easy?   thanks any help appreciated"
