353074,MillerPhoto,2009-06-18 00:24:00,147,"I just joined on Monday.. and registered for the free week tourments..   But if you look at the winners list there are alot of Canadians on there and one from like Manitoba thats won like $27,000 so far!  Be sure you read all the regs for the photos and such before you submit them!"

353175,bigugli,2009-06-18 10:47:00,6138,It's like playing the pools.
353224,johnnyb,2009-06-18 15:28:00,3413,"I checked it out, but haven't registered yet.  I might, but I'm not sure if it will make fishing a little less enjoyable.  I'm sure the guys that have racked up $20K aren't fishing only during the FREE weeks...I'd like to know how much they've spent.  Interesting angle nonetheless"
353239,Roninramirez,2009-06-18 16:32:00,19,Planning to try this season. Always wanted to join a tournament but never wanted to pay the big fees. This way is a (pay as you go tournament). I sure will fish better knowing that theres money on the line.  Good luck  Look for Ronin Fisher
353255,Jonny,2009-06-18 17:32:00,1380,I wonder what you get for the free weeks?  A pat on the back?
353268,mistaredone,2009-06-18 18:24:00,913,what do you pay for a week/day?
