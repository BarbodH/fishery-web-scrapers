My group was very surprised to see a lack of boats between Thursday and Sunday until we made the trek over to the opposite side of Callander Bay (just south of North Bay) on our last night and saw upwards of 50-60 boats.  We did well on white 1/4oz jigheads with a stinger hook and nightcrawler. If you have an ultralight setup, I suggest you bring it as they were biting lightly. The colours that worked for us may not be what works for you. Their preferences change often but we've had more success with lighter colours.  Oh yeah, the mayfly hatch has begun which can make fishing more challanging. Use the search function and you will find relevant info.  Good Luck.  HG"
