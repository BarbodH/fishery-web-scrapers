Please let me know what companies are sold in Canada  Also, any feedback or experiences on these is appreciated."
352911,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-17 16:30:00,1022,"There is also princecraft, sylvan, g3, polar craft, stanley, legend and im sure there is others. Not sure if they all sell jon boats though. I would recommend a lund or princecraft. Good luck with your search, kijiji is a good place to start, and you can also look at trader.ca, as well as forums all over the internet."

Another point, consider a modified jon rather than the regular flat bow. Or consider a regular hull boat for versatility.  Lowe boats"
352969,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-17 19:36:00,10439,G3 makes a Jon Boat as well. In fact they make a bunch of different models and sizes to choose from in both riveted and welded. I don't think you will find a better selection from any manufacturer.  G3 Boats
