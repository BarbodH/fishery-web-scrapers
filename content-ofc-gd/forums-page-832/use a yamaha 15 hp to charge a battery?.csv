You would or may have to remove the flywheel to get at the wiring and add the diode pack to get 12V DC and a charging plug.  Is there a hole or cutout where the optional plug would go on your motor?  I know I can get replacement ones for my little Honda, had to replace a broken charge plug, took a couple days to order the part."
