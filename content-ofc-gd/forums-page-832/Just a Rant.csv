352656,Terry,2009-06-16 22:27:00,14456,I don't believe in taxes...see where that got me
352658,ch312,2009-06-16 22:34:00,1590, nope...the auto workers took it all    mandatory service would be ridiculous in a country like canada and it will never happen so i dont see why someone would even get their hopes up.
352669,ozaibak1,2009-06-16 23:18:00,401," I strongly disagree with you that it should be mandatory, but looking at your avatar, I don't know if I should! Guess what, 'mandatory military service' is how we get things like the Hitler Youth, in fact, making almost anything MANDATORY is a step closer to a dictatorship. I strongly disagree with people who impose their views on everyone, whether they are right or not. Regardless of the initial intention and novel purpose, things evolve, sometimes for the worse. That's how you get billionaires in a communist system.  I also think politics should be avoided on the board, let's face it, it's the most emotionally charged subject and everyone has very strong opinions. It WILL divide the message board. Let's focus on things that unite us instead... like fishing!"
352693,wallyboss,2009-06-17 00:20:00,1095,"Mandatory is not the way to go but, lots of teenagers would benefit from a 3 month Boot camp!!"
352700,holdfast,2009-06-17 00:37:00,1813," Your right in a few ways.  Not right in Canada I totally agree.  Canada is probably Half new comers that were running from war in the First place now. ( don't expect them to fight for this Country)  We have a province that would rather separate than fight for this Country and its growing.  Yes you are right as mandatory Service would ruin our Forces.  We seen it with the french Army.  Their conscripts and professional Soldiers (Volunteers) night and day but they separate them.  It would only work in Canada if they did it on the Week Ends. The Reserves do this all the time and they still find time to study.  The young men of Canada will learn discipline both military and social, Team work, Esprit De Corps, Navigation, Social Skills and of course the Trade that they are assigned as well as History.  And of course they could be used for the aid to Civil Power like the next time Toronto gets into a snow storm."
352706,wallyboss,2009-06-17 00:45:00,1095,"My son joined the Reserves the day he turned 16. He's doing his second Combat Engineer course in Gagetown this summer and then doing 2LC's(??) course and will come out of there as a Master Corporal. I have never seen an 18 year old kid with such good working discipline.  I am so proud of him,  but with all this army training away from home, I have to mow my lawn cause he's never around to do it for me.  By the way I showed him how to play Euchre cause the last time the army went to Toronto they played cards instead of cleaning up the snow."
352722,Big Cliff,2009-06-17 01:17:00,6899,"I chose to spend 3 years in the army and I don't regret a minute of it, if in fact if I could go back, I would probably stay in.  I was very proud of who I was and what I was doing. I started out heading down a rough road when I was younger but it didn't take long to realize that life wasn't just all about me.  My attitude changed quite quickly, I served on many honor guards, compeated in many small arms compitions, learned how to jump from a plane, survive in some rough conditions, and most of all, how to be part of a team. I was very good at what I did because I loved doing it and there was never a prouder moment than when I stood on guard for my country and family.  I was only 18, feared nothing and believed in death before dishonor. When I was 21, I believed that the best way to serve my country and my family was to continue my education so I left the army to go back to school full time. In hindsite I should have stayed in the army and continued my education but I made a choice.  I am still very proud of the little contribution I was able to make, of the people I served with, of those that serve today and of our country.  For those that don't believe in it or choose to crticize those that do! Just remember that those who have served and do serve today are the reason you have the right and freedom to speak your mind.  Oh Canada, I stand on guard for thee (and will until the day I die)!"
352724,Daplumma,2009-06-17 01:32:00,1961,I joined the US Navy as a Seabee when I was 17.Did me a world of good and would do the same for most 17 year olds.A couple of years serving your country would teach a lot to these young boys with their entitlement mentality.After my 6 years I worked in a shop that had mostly ex military and we were the most productive shop that company had.Teamwork and respect for others go a long way and are not such a bad thing to learn.The feminization of our youth has begun for sure.
352731,holdfast,2009-06-17 01:48:00,1813," My Dad did five years in the Navy before I was Borne and you would think he did twenty.  he loved it , Regretted getting out and it seemed like the Happiest time of his life.  He had great stories that i loved to hear as a kid and understood it even more as an adult.  The poor guy was born with a birthmark covering half his face.  He used to joke that the Army didnt accept him because he wasn't pretty enough.  So he jumped the trains from Montreal to Winnipeg and joined the Navy.  Love ya Dad ..RIP"
352748,danbouck,2009-06-17 02:26:00,4380,I disagree 100%  If it was mandatory I would be moving my family elsewhere
352776,spinnerbaitking,2009-06-17 03:45:00,1622,"I don't believe in making it mandatory but youth of today definately need some thing to start them out right, Maybe pick stones & help bale hay for a summer, I've been an adult leader in Scouts & an Adult advisor for a up to 64 Kids in an Archery club, now a 4-H leader of a Fishing club about 30 members, kids need rules that are enforced and they need things to keep them busy Richard"
352782,Fishnwire,2009-06-17 04:03:00,983,  How does a Canadain kid getting blown up by a road side IED in some village in Afghanistan grant me the right and freedom to speak my mind?

352788,holdfast,2009-06-17 04:43:00,1813,Coming from You.  Id Jail you in a heartbeat if Canada asked for your services ( Yes it would be because of War)  and you refused.  Actually Id volunteer to be your Friendly Jailer.
352792,holdfast,2009-06-17 05:08:00,1813," Because that Kid is a protector of your Nation where you have the right to speak and vote for your leaders without getting shot.  His only mistake is that he happened to be doing his duty for Canada when your Nation ( Canada) told him to go overseas as a representative and protector of this Nation when called upon.  He did not ask to go, but he also did not refuse when called upon.  We do have some courageous selfless Canadians.  HE DID NOT EVER HIDE BEHIND THE CANADIAN FLAG.    DO YOU."
352803,Terry,2009-06-17 09:52:00,14456, i guess I schools don't teach enough history............that's a sad statement
352804,Big Cliff,2009-06-17 10:16:00,6899," Could you show me on a Map of Canada where any of the following are: Vimy Ridge Ypres Passchendaele Somme Dieppe Hong Kong Normandy  Oh wait, here is one: The Battle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which saw German U-boats penetrate the Cabot Strait and the Strait of Belle Isle to sink 23 ships between 1942 and 1944, marked the only time since the War of 1812 that enemy warships inflicted death within Canada's territorial waters.  Canadians have being giving their lives overseas to keep Canada safe and free and to support others. Would you prefer that we wait until our children are being blown up by road side IEDs as they play before we act? Believe me it could happen!"
352808,Chris,2009-06-17 11:02:00,405," I was born with the right and freedom to speak my mind and to be free. Just because some politician (or the so-called society they have created) wants to take that right away from me, means nothing to me. Just because I happened to be born inside borders that were created by some slimeball politician means nothing to me. Just because some idiot politician has decided to go to war means nothing to me. All of the world's problems are created by politicians, and supported by those who believe in their pathetic systems. Canada's soldiers are not defending our freedom in this day and age, they are supposedly defending someone elses.....if you believe that's why they are over there! Do you actually believe that politicians who screw their own people over every day really care about individual freedoms half way across the world? Dream on, there's another agenda.  Yes, I am unpatriotic, so what, who says I have to be. Who's gonna make me? Couldn't care less about your imaginary borders or where you're from. I look after myself and my family and couldn't give a crap about anybody else as nobody else gives a crap about me and my family.  Sorry Holdfast....go ahead and tear me a new one."
352811,Daplumma,2009-06-17 11:15:00,1961,Good luck with that attitude.Lucky you live in a place where braver men than you have given you that right.

352505,BITEME,2009-06-16 15:16:00,1968,So I  am walking the floor at the facility today and I bear witness to yet another flag draped warrior . Although proud of them it saddens me a great deal as well. I write this partly because of the E.I post the other day and mostly because I have a belief in our men and women that serve. I have bore witness to almost all that have perished in the last few years and do not hesitate to go to the floor and thank there fellow warriors that send them off to there final destination . Anyway I believe that every kid that gets out of high school should have to serve at least 2 to 3 years of service before they go to the work force or school I have always believed this and will support it always if it comes up. I truly think it would put things in perspective for all and yes there will be losses but you do this for your country. I really don’t know where im going with this I guess the EI post lit the fuse and the coffin was the explosion anyway if your sitting around collecting your not looking and there is tons of work out there you might have to work 16 hours to make up for 8 and I might not be what you want at the moment  but you wont be sucking off the social twit. Im strong Im proud Im free and there are reasons for this sure I keep paying into it I have for the last 30 years dosent mean I will ever draw from it its not in my code.There are always jobs in the forces and I can tell you right now you will bond with and find no better people then the ones you stand proud alongside  JMO
352509,BillM,2009-06-16 15:19:00,17367,"The Forces isn't just a job, it's a career.   If I'm ever in the position where I've exhausted all possibilities, you bet your ass I'll file for E.I.   I don't feel any shame in taking advantage of something I've been paying into since I was 15 with my very first pay check."
352518,snoil,2009-06-16 15:33:00,139,Touchy subject.I know that when i finished high school (1978) it would have done me a world of good.but i didn't realize that until a few years later.Then i got married and had two girls in the mid 1980's and the thought of them in the services never crossed my mind.Now that i've got two young boys age 9&7 the thought of them in the services scares the hell out of me.It might do them the world of good but it still scares me.God bless them all.

352534,Jonny,2009-06-16 17:10:00,1380,"Ever notice that the veterans of WWII who have seen the most and done the most don't talk about it much?  I do think that a year or two of compulsory military service would do a lot of young people a lot of good. But we will never see it in this country --- we never have, even in dire times."
352540,BITEME,2009-06-16 17:34:00,1968, Not in this lifetime!!!!!!
352544,CLofchik,2009-06-16 17:48:00,854," Actually Canada did have conscription in WWI, culminating in the Army opening fire on a crowd of war protesters in Quebec City and leading to the Quebec nationalist movement under Bourassa and the alienation of Francophone moderates like Laurier.  Careful what you wish for."
352549,jediangler,2009-06-16 17:59:00,1923,"There are plenty of countries out there with mandatory military service, why don't you move to one of them?"
352558,BITEME,2009-06-16 18:17:00,1968,did my bit not as much as some but certainly more then others like i said JMO
352561,pikehunter,2009-06-16 18:29:00,1659,Somedays we really should stick with fishing related topics and keep our own personal politics to ourselves.
352564,Jonny,2009-06-16 18:38:00,1380," True, I had forgotten about that in my haste to reply. It was instituted late in the war and the conscripts were derogatorily called ""zombies"" by soldiers who had volunteered.   Well in a way, I agree, but it's part of the whole package of what makes this site interesting. We have fishing in common but lots of opinions on a variety of stuff."
352566,cram,2009-06-16 18:41:00,1733,"Is it me or is EI and welfare being lumped into the same bucket here?  THey are SOOO different.  I'm sure there are cases where people wrongly take advantage of the EI system (and by doing so, are taking advantage of all of us).....and i'm sure there are (a few) people who i'd have no problem with being on welfare....but overall they are VERY different and my feelings are pretty polarized on which one is justified, and visa versa."
352570,doubleheader,2009-06-16 18:46:00,497,"I'm speaking about mandatory service now, not an opinion on what would be right for Canada as I'm a US citizen. I served in the US Navy during the Viet Nam war, and while I volunteered and would not have been drafted due to my draft number, many of those I served with were drafted, and it is from that group I draw this conclusion.  While mandatory military service may be good for many young people, but it's not necessarily good for the military. I don't think it should be the military's nor the taxpayer's responsibility to try to train the untrainable, and at least in the U.S. there are a whole lot of 18 year old kids that would be nothing but a burden on our military. If my life were on the line, I'd like to know that the guys or gals I'm fighting with chose this career path and have proven they belong."
352576,Woodsman,2009-06-16 19:23:00,1286,"doubleheader: As someone who had served in the Canadian Forces for 13 years I can only agree with you. We have had some who joined only later find out that it wasn't a choice they were happy with. These few, some with very poor attitudes were a pain in the butt to serve with until they finished their basic engagement. To force youth to go into the forces after school would only degrade the quality of our forces and drain much needed money from the forces. The function of the nco's would become one of babysitter / enforcer instead of leader. The size of our forces would greatly increase taking up much needed money for improved equipment. As it sits now there is for more qualified applicants  than there is positions available.  Rick"
352590,TennesseeGuy,2009-06-16 19:49:00,957,"Restoring the draft in the U.S. would slow the feminization of the American male, but would weaken the military.  Too many males can no longer be turned.  The door of opportunity is closed."
352591,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-16 19:50:00,835,"Mandatory service would give the Gov. the ability to brainwash the population, not a good thing.  As for EI or welfare I have worked with guys that society would have been further ahead to pay them to stay home, if you haven't  consider yourself lucky."

352598,Terry,2009-06-16 20:06:00,14456,I disagree with you  and I did a couple of years in the armed forces after high school but that was a personal choice  and would fight to keep it that way
352619,Governator,2009-06-16 20:44:00,879,"I think the site could really benefit with an off topic forum.  Also, sorry but I don't agree in forcing kids from high school who graduate in to armed forces.  It takes away you're free right to choose which is what makes this country so great."
352620,Fishnwire,2009-06-16 20:45:00,983,"I can't support this idea that young people should be subjected to mandatory military service.  The military is certainly not for everyone.  While it has certainly helped to shape the lives of some excellent men and women, people like Jeffrey Dalmer also served, so we know that not everyone with service is someone whom others should aspire to be like.  I have worked alongside about a hundred electricians in my carrer.  Three of those guys had done their apprenticeship in the military, and they just happen to be the three worst electricians I've ever met.  I'm sure there are many excellent tradesmen trained in and/or working for the military, I'm just saying that in at least some cases, the army does not turn out ""the best of the best.""  Lots of people have found self-betterment through their service in the military.  For them it was a good fit and they benefitted from the experience.  The same would not necessarily be true for all individuals.     EI and welfare are not the same thing, but this guy has hit the nail on the head.  Some people don't deserve to have a job.  They get a few hundred bucks a month to stay home, and they stay home.  Seems like a good deal to me.  I'm OK with it."
352634,JohnF,2009-06-16 21:14:00,3494," I'm with you. Not that I served any time in the military save for my high school cadet days but from what I've seen there's a lot of young people who'd benefit hugely from a little structure and discipline in their lives. Heaven knows they aren't getting much of it at home. And it's not a socio-economic thang either. Some of the worst raised kids are from affluent homes. What they really need is the mother of all spankings, except for too many it's too late. The spanking should have been administered to their loving parents years ago. Remember ""spare the rod and spoil the child""? I believe that. Sparing the rod is figurative though. Parents don't have to actually beat their kids to discipline them, just be firm and consistent, with a good set of rules and expectations and a very good role model presentation.  I've met guys who went the military route who came away with nothing but an attitude and some arcane knowledge of hand to hand combat and an idea of how to use a gun (probably one not acceptable in our society at that). I have some good friends in the States who are products of the military system. They are special people. One in particular is the guy I most want to be with in a life threatening emergency while scuba diving. He would literally die for his buddy. But in social situations he's a disaster. There's no fight or flight with this guy - only fight. His idea of coping is to pull a K-bar and deal with the problem. I have been embarrassed in bars too many times by him when he was defending someone's honour when the someone just really wanted to getthehelloutadodge. He and I haven't been on speaking terms for a few years now cuz of his all or nothing attitude. If he's what ya get when you put a kid into the marines at age 17 I'll take the civilian life. I can do with a little less ""OORAH!"" in my life. Hope that doesn't offend any ex-marines here. I really have no issue with commitment, just overdoing it. And I still proudly call that guy my friend. He thinks I suck.  JF"
