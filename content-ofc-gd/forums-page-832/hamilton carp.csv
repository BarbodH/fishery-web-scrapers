353057,hammercarp,2009-06-17 23:35:00,964,"They are in the midst of spawning. Some are spawned out and some are still plump with roe. That was a few days ago. Eastport, CCIW and Bayfront all have fish in them."
353119,CLofchik,2009-06-18 01:50:00,854,"The Carp Barrier at Cootes has been the only steady fishing I've found, but that's more numbers than size.  Eastport & Inland Waters has been running hot or cold, and they've been damn finicky."
