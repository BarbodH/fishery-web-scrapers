352265,cityfisher,2009-06-15 20:23:00,959, One of my fav boats... great setup for everything and all weather. I think the price might be a little high for an 02 though...
352337,brkygetr,2009-06-16 00:34:00,425," Yes I agree, no two ways about it...nothing more annoying than an under-powered boat....especially when it comes to putting a few people or lots of gear in it."
352340,Dara,2009-06-16 00:40:00,3052,"Hi Cliff. I looked at that boat and motor in a side console model. I got a Sylvan instead with a 60 Yammie. My boat is a V hull and weighs in at 804 compared to your 834. Its rated for a 75 and I wouldn't want any less than the 60. Looking at the same weight basically I would say get the 60 on yours. My decision was based a lot on the fact that a 50 and 60 are the same weight, but the 75 is another 150 lbs. I don't know why they rate the same size and weight boat so different, but maybe the V hull does it. PS, If you go with a yammie, they have a trolling kit that will let you control RPM's in 50 rpm increments from standard idle speed of 750, all the way down to 450. Would make for great trolling with no kicker, and you can't hear a 4 stroke run. its actually funny. my electric makes more noise that the 60"
352390,Big Cliff,2009-06-16 02:40:00,6899,"Well, I have listened long and hard, researched as much as I can and I am pleased to say we now have a quote on that package with the 60 on it. Got a few loose ends to tie up yet (fish finder GPS) and some safety equipment but with all your help and input I think/hope we'll have a new boat very soon."
352398,Dara,2009-06-16 03:07:00,3052,"  I'm guessing $17,900.00 with no trailer taxes extra"
352698,Big Cliff,2009-06-17 00:33:00,6899,"Dara, I am courious, Where did you come up with that #?  Are you a dealer or something?  Cliff"
352851,doubleheader,2009-06-17 13:16:00,497,"I think you might improve your options considerably if you were open to both a riveted boat and welded boat. I have a welded boat, a Crestliner, and it's a decent boat, but I've also owned riveted boats that have been good to me. I'm just saying you'd have more options and a better chance of finding a deal.  Personally I think one of the best made boats on the market today is Alumacraft, but besides them you could look at Lund, G3, and Princecraft.  Dealers should be willing to negotiate this time of year. One nice thing about the Alumacraft is the double hull, especially if you fish the rocks."
352872,Dara,2009-06-17 14:27:00,3052," I just bought pretty close to the same boat. I'm looking at the differences, no trailer, motor, location, and taking a guess.  I saw a deal on the same as what I got in North bay and I may have saved a bit, but I don't know exactly what the package was there. I think I did ok on mine, but I do like to buy local so sometimes I have to spend a few extra dollars. I'm in construction and don't like seeing out of town contractors here so I practice what I preach."
352881,John,2009-06-17 14:51:00,2956," I liked the Alumacraft line too, however dealers in Canada are few and far between. When I bought a Princecraft last year, I could not find one Alumacraft dealer in Ontario.  I found the Lund dealers had little or no inventory.  Other than the west coast boats, (North River etc), Crestliner is probably the only welded hull I would consider. But that's just me."
352918,doubleheader,2009-06-17 17:06:00,497,"Two years ago my buddy bought an Alumacraft. He put a deposit down with a dealer in PA at a big boat show. I found him the exact same deal for thousands less at Lacannes Marine in Faribault MN. The PA dealer couldn't touch the deal nor anyone else we contacted. He saved almost $3K after the cost of going out and getting it, which was over 2,000 miles round trip.  Plus we had a fun road trip and I ate the best wings I've ever had in my life."
351237,Big Cliff,2009-06-11 23:49:00,6899,"OK, I am looking for a new boat and a little overwhelmed at all the choices that are out there: Here are some of my criteria, all help and suggestions would be much appreciated.  1999 - 2009 ( am some what flexable on price but don't want to blow the budget I only get out about 15 to 20 times a year and when fishing usually only go a mile or two from the house)  15-17' suitable for fishing or just taking the wife for a ride V or modified V hull welded aluminum hull must have full windshild 75% of maximum rated horse power outboard kicker motor carpeted floor good quality fish finder and GPS (not necessarly combined)  I'd prefer to get a brand of motors that I can get serviced locally so mercury, honda, yamaha... I don't need a trailer  So, any or all suggestions or help would be much appreciated!"
351255,danbouck,2009-06-12 00:28:00,4380,"You are gonna hear that every make is great and terrible. I always suggest that you spend a little time researching then go and sit in the boats and pick the one you like most, that's what I did"
351293,bigbuck,2009-06-12 02:01:00,2449,"Cliff, go take a look over at Buckeye Marine, they might have something for ya. Otherwise, sniff around some of the marinas and small dealers and repair shops, there might be something around that will tickle your fancy."
351294,Greencoachdog,2009-06-12 02:10:00,8163,"It sounds like you're in the market for a 17' Deep ""V"" W/T with a 75 hp name brand to me, that should narrow it down a little... but still lots of choices!"
351330,mikeh,2009-06-12 03:36:00,824,"I know it's not what you asked for but it looks like a decent package . grew bowrider after looking at it, it is probably rated for alot more than a 75hp,I'd imagine it's rated for a 115hp."
351341,tschirk,2009-06-12 04:08:00,261,check classifieds - a hardcore buddy from work is upgrading from his 2008 lund - fully decked out 27hrs to bigger boat for Simcoe.
351348,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-12 05:20:00,947,http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=32910  Kicker can be installed later but PrinceCraft Make amazing boats
351355,Gerritt,2009-06-12 10:40:00,6129,Cliff... Might be worth it to pay a visit to Giesler marine. Better folks you will not find!
351362,ColdH20guy,2009-06-12 11:28:00,312,"this may be an option if you feel like a drive to Orillia.............  BOAT SHOW STARTS TODAY   Enjoying summer sports may just be what people need to relieve the stress of an unstable economy, said the organizer of a local boat and cottage show.  With 80 to 100 boats of all sizes for sale, the Spring Boat, Cottage and Outdoor Show which runs from today through Sunday, offers just that, Doug Bunker said.  ""Everybody's a little bit nervous (about the economy), let's face it. But I think people still come up and use their cottages, or their boats,"" Bunker said. ""They'll still spend their money on things that cause less stress in life.""  The annual in-water boat show fills the Port of Orillia's docks with new and pre-owned boats from inflatables to offshore performance and fishing boats to cruisers, he said.  The show offers private and commercial owners an opportunity to sell their boats.  ""Where else can you go and try the boat out right there in Lake Simcoe?"" Bunker said. ""Most people put down a deposit to pay for gas, to avoid joy riders.""  The event's attendance was dampened last year by a combination of unpleasant weather and high gas prices.  ""It affected not only sales, but general attitude up there,"" Bunker said.  There will be displays and vendors, including marine safety demonstrations and boat licensing information, he said.  There will also be a high-performance boat poker run tomorrow to support the Orillia volunteer firefighters, Bunker said.  ""They're big, they're fast they're 1,000 horse-power and they're pretty amazing boats,"" he said. ""They're like the Formula One of the boating industry.""    The boats leave from the Port of Orillia at 10 a. m. to officially start in the Atherley Narrows, Bunker said.  They will travel from Orillia to Cooks Bay, Lagoon City and down to Barrie for lunch before returning to Orillia at approximately 3 p. m.  Article ID# 1609982"
351445,ecmilley,2009-06-12 17:33:00,2163,"cliff you can't go wrong with the lund, princecraft or smokercraft/sylvan boats, but you want a welded hull for some reason i would look at cresliner as the only welded option"
351455,John,2009-06-12 18:17:00,2956,"Hi Cliff, you have a PM.  If I was lucky enough to live on the water as you do and not have to trailer, I would probably buy a glass boat. I prefer comfort these days, but that's just me!  J..."
351464,Banger68,2009-06-12 18:53:00,157,I've been keeping my eye on the same thing but I would like a rear bench too. I found the Crestliner Sportfish or Superhawk and Legend Xcaliber in welded.
351482,Spiel,2009-06-12 20:12:00,9065,"You could fire off a PM to Fish farmer, he's selling his 17'-18' (?) Princecraft, complete package, electronics, riggers, trolling motor. I know it's on Kijiji somewhere."
351525,Big Cliff,2009-06-12 22:46:00,6899,"After getting a lot of excellent feedback I would definatly now also consider a Princecraft. I would like to try to buy locally and the more Sue and I look, the more we think that buying new is the way we will go. It'll probably be the last boat and motor package we ever buy so we might as well get EXACTLY what we want.  I'll be checking out Princecraft boats in the next few days.  Sent Fish Farmer a PM  Will try to get over to that show  Anymore thoughts or suggestions are always appreciated.    Cliff"
351532,Roy,2009-06-12 23:03:00,13728,"I didn't want to sway you in any way Cliff, but the largest Princecraft dealer in the world is a sponsor of this community. Marc or myself can probably get you the best price....even after you've finished haggling with them. Give it a thought.  Hugs to Sue."
351639,Big Cliff,2009-06-13 10:21:00,6899,"Well to be honest with you Roy, part of the reason I am even looking for a new boat is because of how impressed I was with Marc's setup.  Here is one that Sue and I are considering.  Our boat?  I am thinking that this boat with a 50 on it? I don't need a trailer (other than getting it into the Trent Severen waterway) or towing cover as it would be stored inside on my marine railway when not in use. I really don't need a top for it as Sue and I wouldn't be going out in it in bad weather anyway.  Thoughts, comments, ideas?"
351645,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-06-13 11:12:00,1362,Looks like a nice boat Cliff!!  ....I'd probably get the 60HP which is the maximum rated for that boat instead of the 50HP...  Good luck with the boat hunting!!  Steve
351673,bassboy,2009-06-13 14:08:00,161,"Cliff.....  Hopefully I am not too late with this.....but A friend of my Father is looking for a boat too (they live in Lindsay) and apparently there is some event at Buckeye marine in Bobcaygeon (I am not affiliated with them in any way.....just heard about it and wanted to pass it on) this weekend....or today at least.  I believe they sell Princecraft, and I know they sell Legend....thats where my Father bought his a few years ago.....they even delivered the boat (by water...my parents used to live on Kennedy Bay by the marina)....hopefully you see this in time if you didnt already know about it (and I hope the info is correct and that my Fathers friend is not full of it  )  Bill"
351677,danbouck,2009-06-13 15:12:00,4380,  FYI - I've got the same size boat with a 50 4 stroke Merc. It goes up to about 30mph. Cruises nice at 20mph. It is a great motor!
351778,Fish Farmer,2009-06-14 02:05:00,2234,Cliff: I just posted my boat in the OFC Classified.
351820,Marc Thorpe,2009-06-14 08:43:00,621,"hey Cliff,get some prices and send me an email Me and Roy will see what we can do"
351844,Big Cliff,2009-06-14 11:31:00,6899,"Thanks Marc, you know the kind of fishing I want to do, do you think this package with the 50 on it will do it for me or do you think I need a kicker too?"
351847,Roy,2009-06-14 11:48:00,13728,You don't need a kicker Cliff.   I'm using a 60hp 4 stroke and I troll down to 1.2mph with it.
352015,Sinker,2009-06-15 00:37:00,8692,"Looks like a nice boat Cliff. I'd really think long and hard about the power though. Max it out!! You won't regret it, and it does make a difference. I'm not talking speed, just overall responsiveness and handling. If you don't do it now, it will be more $ down the rd.  My boat is rated for a 40, I put a 30 on it and its a whole different rig. I didn't like it at all. With the 40, its great!!  S."
352090,Jer,2009-06-15 11:08:00,1426,"  That's a nice looking boat, Cliff.  The only thing missing seems to be a rear pedestal seat/fishing deck? On a boat over 16' long there seems no reason not to have room for one."
