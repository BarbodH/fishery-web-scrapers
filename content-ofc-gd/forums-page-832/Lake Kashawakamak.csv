Lots of smallies and largies in there with the occasional pike; walleyes have gotten a LOT harder to catch in the past couple years, not quite sure why. Try going to Fernleigh lodge, the owner, Kevin is a really nice guy, my first time going up there he gave me a map with a bunch of good spots circled that produced some nice fish. Try fishing spinnebaits around any weed beds you can find, for the open water use a leach or minnow on a small hook behind a couple split shots, just drag it as slow and your can, always works for me. Its a beautiful lake with some pretty good fishing. There's also a bunch of back lakes in the area that have walleye, bass, pike, even some specks.  Almost forgot, one of our members, Justin Hoffman, wrote and article on Kashawakamak, here it is  http://www.ontariofishing.net/news2008/dec2008-2.html  His info did me well.  -Ben"
