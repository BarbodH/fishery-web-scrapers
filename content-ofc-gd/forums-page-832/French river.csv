352546,lowdeuces22,2009-06-16 17:49:00,3,anyone ever fish that stretch of river?  I'm renting a cottage there in sept.  and was hoping someone has some info on the fishing in this area.  I understand I'll be locked between two sets of rapids.
352559,johnnyb,2009-06-16 18:21:00,3413,"Most rapids on the French will hold all kinds of smallies, fish tube jigs and crank baits.  Walleye should also be in there...but I wouldn't know much about them"

Flat rapids are easily navigable with care and I'd suggest you do it. Best fishing imo is from Flat Rapids down. For walleye troll at night with the largest floating Rapala. The train trestle just downstream from Flat Rapids is always a good spot. I usually anchor there just upstream from the train bridge. Large 4-5"" sucker or chub minnows are deadly that time of year."
