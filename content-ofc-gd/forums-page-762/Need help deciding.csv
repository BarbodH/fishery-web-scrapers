404706,tdotfisherman,2009-11-22 19:18:00,317,My vote was for the impulse purchase.. the trolling motor.
404489,SlowPoke,2009-11-21 17:09:00,2984,"We listed our house for sale Tuesday and had multiple offers yesterday. We accepted an offer a little over asking price (yay!) and that now leaves us with a dilema. I'm looking for an unbiased opinion on where we should invest our little bit of 'found money'.  I'm leaning in one direction, my wife is leaning in another. To be fair, I won't say who prefers what.   Maytag Gemini    Minkota Terrova  "
404490,mistyriver1,2009-11-21 17:26:00,600,"Brian, did your wife put this same post on a ""kitchen appliance"" forum ?"
404491,SlowPoke,2009-11-21 17:31:00,2984," LOL Jim, for some reason she can't access the internet from her computer."
404492,kickingfrog,2009-11-21 17:32:00,8333,"Get the stove, and then explain how much better you could catch fish to cook on/in it if you had the thruster."
404493,SlowPoke,2009-11-21 17:33:00,2984,"This poll is going horribly wrong, how do I delete it?"
404494,kickingfrog,2009-11-21 17:34:00,8333,Be careful what you ask for.
404500,bigugli,2009-11-21 17:57:00,6138,"You keep forgetting the cardinal rule.  "" Nobody's happy til Momma's happy"""
404502,JohnF,2009-11-21 18:01:00,3494," Deep in yer heart you really know she deserves a new appliance. The extra money on the offer is probably due to her meticulous housekeeping and extraordinary decorating skills. Yer fishability had nothing at all to do with the price on the house. Give credit where credit is due, and then put the trolling motor on that credit card she doesn't know about. We all have them, don't we?  That's the win win solution.  JF"
404504,SlowPoke,2009-11-21 18:42:00,2984," She did work her butt off prepping for showings and painting stucco ceilings. And it will fill the 30"" void in the counter top at the new place.  On the other hand, she could use the Terrova as a counter mounted mix master."
404507,fishinguypat,2009-11-21 18:56:00,547,"it's actually quite ironic...you need the stove to fry the fish,but you need the trolling motor to catch the fish...we have reached an in pass"
404508,Paully,2009-11-21 19:23:00,712,Not too many good reviews on this double oven...
404511,Fisherman,2009-11-21 19:45:00,7201,"What Shore Lunch said, sometimes the bells and whistles are ringing for you to pay attention and run. Looks good, but when the cooktop gets to 175 degrees when the upper oven is on can't be good or safe."
404512,Terry,2009-11-21 19:52:00,14456,are we on the cooking channel or the fishing channel...
404515,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-21 20:22:00,10439,Brian I think you should go with the MinnKota that your wife wants. I know you really want the maytag but for the sake of your marriage go with what will make the wife happy.
404524,JohnF,2009-11-21 21:42:00,3494," Buy her a Kitchenaid, ya cheapskate. You'd only resent it every time you saw her making some culinary delight with the trolling motor when what you really knew it should be doing is powering the front end of yer boat. And besides, a MinnKota looks dumb on the kitchen counter, unless it's at a fishing camp.  Have you bought the stove yet? And the mixmaster? What's holding you up?  JF"
404525,bassman,2009-11-21 21:57:00,384,Stay away from Maytag.....garbage.
404540,Daplumma,2009-11-21 23:17:00,1961,"Take up cooking bud and get a good stove.The motor will come with time.I got mine a six burner with a double oven and a griddle.I love to cook now and one day she said I can go out on my boat..if I clean up the kitchen,wash the dishes and mop the floor. Joe"
404541,SlowPoke,2009-11-21 23:24:00,2984,"    Okay, so I'll put you guys as 2 votes for Minnkota.  I'll consider the reviews. As for Maytag being garbage; how about enlightening the rest of the class?"
404559,Mike the Pike,2009-11-22 00:12:00,3421,I say you must buy the Minnekota.  By purchasing a new home your new boat purchase has been delayed therefore you must put new toys on the old boat.  Wifey got a new home and you need a new motor now this is fair.
404590,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-22 01:49:00,2582,I'm confused If you sold you house and only have enough  found money for a stove or a trolling motor. Would you be so kind as to tell me who your listing/selling agent is....just so I can stay FAR FAR away from them
404594,SlowPoke,2009-11-22 02:05:00,2984," Let me simplfy this for you. Let's say I was cleaning out my car and FOUND MONEY under the seats. I now have $1.53 in my pocket that I didn't expect to have. Gee, maybe I'll treat myself to a coffee.  When we sold, we didn't plan on getting full asking price or over asking price. That's not the trend in London. So we have a few unemcumbered bucks to spend."
404600,misfish,2009-11-22 02:20:00,29133,Who wears the pants in your family Brian?
404603,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-22 02:36:00,2582,   No problems...I was only poking fun.  Over full asking price  ....perhaps I should rethink my previous statement. Who did you say your listing agent was
404689,jjcanoe,2009-11-22 17:50:00,744,"How about a compromise, Scratch and Dent stove AND a Minnkota Endura ......  So should I pick you up now and we'll head to London Home Basics and Angling Outfitters?  I'm willing to donate my pickup to this worthy cause to help with the transportation of these fine items.  Your wife is at work right now isn't she?  jjcanoe"
404693,azebra,2009-11-22 18:26:00,168,"lol cuz its maytag thats in the lead? were all for the wife,nothing personal but that way they are nice and will let you fish to cook on her stove.. maybe get a used maytag and a new minkota or vice versa..or used both but tell her the stove is new! little fib never hurt.. that much!"
