It is in Mount Elgin Community Centre on HWY 19 just south of the 401.  I went to the very first one last year and was very happy I did! Some very cool displays of lures/reel/ rods etc There are dealer/collectors buying and selling. I took a couple of old lures I could not identify and there were several ""experts"" there who helped me out.  Some VERY unique items on display.  Here's a link to the associations site...just click on ""shows""   http://www.cafta.ca/  If anyone is considering going, it is totally worth the trip. They normally have their shows near GTA or Ottawa. We need to support them to keep them coming back.  These people really help to educate our young(and not so young) about what was  and maybe what will be...if anyone gets the itch to make something. I already have that itch and my wife thinks it has turned into a RASH!!   LOL  FT"
