404483,grt1,2009-11-21 16:49:00,638,"I go to several web sites that are fishing related, this one is the one I frequent the most.  Today I went to a site that was out of Ignace ontario that had information on northwestern ontario. the last time I was on it was the spring and it really wasn't a very active site. Today I went on it and someone has changed all the topic contents. For instance, under General Discussion the topics are all PORN.  In the fishing reports the topics are all like this ""mumbi from albania, uri from russia"" I never opened any but this is definately not a fishing site anymore.  Guess I'll be deleting it from my favorites now."
404498,Terry,2009-11-21 17:54:00,14456,still a fishing site but they are fishing for different things
404503,SBCregal,2009-11-21 18:40:00,688,they're still using worms for bait
404519,Jonny,2009-11-21 20:51:00,1380,Some people's priorities are so screwed up!
404530,Rizzo,2009-11-21 22:38:00,4754,"you may be deleting it from favorites, but probably a few others are adding it"

I have seen lots of fishing sites using cheap forum software get crushed by spam bots and have had to rescue a few sites. Its not easy and not a fun job to fix them. so the big bucks we spend here is totally worth it. We were under a constant attack awhile back which was causing our site to slow down. These spammers are very determined."
404543,Raf,2009-11-21 23:35:00,3495,it's one of the downsides of having an 'open' forum.  especially if people don't need to be registered to post or registration is done through email validation.  i don't get hit with spammers whatsoever although they do try to register and post - i am using 'cheap'  software.
