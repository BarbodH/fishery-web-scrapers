403929,bigfish1965,2009-11-19 22:10:00,3382, Stop using internet explorer. Older versions see the google ads as a seperate page so you have to click once to go back for the ads and click again for the page. It is a browser flaw. The server stuff...I dunno. Seems to last only a minute or two then be fine so we shall wait and see what the host says.
403939,GBW,2009-11-19 22:25:00,8460,it must be those Dollarama batteries in the UPS TJ is using...
403998,Fisherman,2009-11-20 01:02:00,7201," If I ever trap the Pink Bunny, I'm sending him on a mission, play drumsticks on TJ while he's running around the woods doing a torture test on BPS socks."
