It's perfect...the pics are amazing...I'm pretty sure it's my new favourite video  :D One day, pal....ONE DAY...you and I are gonna light up a big pile o' fish on the ice Thanks for sharing...I'm actually going to bed without checking any more posts now....don't want to spoil this one"
403728,limeyangler,2009-11-19 04:47:00,5204," LOL...i wanna see that project Bruce, i'll post the pics on an icefishing site i frequent!    I know what ya mean, i'm sooooo impatient now, and the weather is litteraly tropical for these parts at this time of the year, last year our lake was completely iced over, i'm still casting at liquid water here and your lucky to get the guides on your rod icy so far this year....why oh why did i put the boat away so early....DOH!    Come on man....get out there this year! you know ya wanna   That there is one of my all time favourite ice fishing pics Ben, was a great day out too, i'm still getting crap from Lew for not bringing him some of those Tulibee i was catching for dead baiting last spring...oh well...we'll just ahve to do it again!    if it acts as an inspiration my work is done here...lol, thanks for the reply.    Hope to get some really nice trout this year, i have promised myself to get on the Upper Manitou Lake as often as possible this year...some really Lakers in there.    Glad you liked it JB.....this day on the ice you mention sounds pretty darned good to me......as for the song...its Simon and Garfunkel, i had all the albums when i was a kid ( my brain tells me i still am a kid....my efforts at the gym tell me otherwise....lol) I think the Bangles covered that song....but the original is way better...perfect for the topic i thought."

403878,anonymous,2009-11-19 19:20:00,58,"I love that area up there. We setup moose camp 40km's north on Basket Lake road each year and the scenery, wildlife and fishing are excellent. One day I will retire up that way and enjoy everyday of my life."
404007,Spiel,2009-11-20 01:37:00,9065,"For me there's no way to put a negative spin on ice fishing, I love it! From perch to kings and everything between, I love it! Thanks for putting some warmth into this damp, grey, rainy day Simon."
