Taking my stepson out tomorrow for his first ever hunt.  he is eight yrs old and has really been doing good with his 410 that i got him earlier this summer. at 35 yrds he is dead on and pretty confident.  i hope to get him a shot on a doe at least sometime tomorow.  wish us luck !  jason"

404609,oxcowboy,2009-11-22 02:49:00,544,well we struck out this morning.  Ethan missed a nice 120-130 class 8 pt.  the buck came in around 40 yards and to the back of the stand.  i got him turned around and by the time i did that and got the deer stopped he was at a bad angle.  we are going to try it again in the morning.  jason
