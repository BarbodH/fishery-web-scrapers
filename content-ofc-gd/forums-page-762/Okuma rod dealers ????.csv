I,along with my son,have contacted Okuma,left messages with no reply.He broke the top piece of his 3 piece rod after having only one small fish on.Clean break at the ferull.  NO REPLIES.Even BPS would not help him out.The place where he bought it. Yeah yeah yeah,no reciept.  Not the best customer service place IMO.  Pics tell the words.      As you can see,very clean.Used one day.  "
