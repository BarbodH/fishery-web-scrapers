404138,shane,2009-11-20 14:53:00,652,"A few years ago, my wife put mothballs out in her garden to try to keep the critters away.  One day I noticed a bird out there acting strange and checked it out with the binoculars.  It was a grackle and he had a mothball in his beak and was rubbing it all over himself like he was in the shower.  Getting under his wings and around his back and doing a good job.  I can only guess that he was using the mothball to get rid of bugs on his body.  But, how would he have figured that out?"

404532,jaydub,2009-11-21 22:43:00,145,That is cool!  Animals are smarter that we give them credit that's for sure.
