403348,TDunn,2009-11-18 04:57:00,680,"Hit up the St Marys River rapids this afternoon. I was on a solo mission looking for some steelie action. I caught all but one fish bouncing spawn or pinkies today. One small rainbow came on a cleo as you will see. I gave flies and white twisters an honest go today but couldnt get a hit on them.  ice on the ponds....    The river.....could definilty smell the salmon today....      The fish...            Underwater videos  Release small bow  Bigger bow release  another small one  The rapids at the end of the day    Can't complain about the afternoon, it was nice and relaxing.....but I hope the size of the fish improve next time!
