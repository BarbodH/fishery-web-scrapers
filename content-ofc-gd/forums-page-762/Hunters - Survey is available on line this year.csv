404586,misfish,2009-11-22 01:36:00,29133,Well done Bernie and gang.   Great photo.
404592,Bernie,2009-11-22 02:01:00,3190,Thanks Brian. My uncle Joe (second from the left at the back) has been hunting at our camp since 1943 for 2 weeks each year. Thats 66 years to save you the calculation. That  adds up to well over two years spent hunting there over his lifetime. He still is in great shape and drives his ATV like a champ. I think he's 84 now. My dad (kneeling on the right) isn't too far behind him in years spent there and can shoot as well as anyone at 77.
