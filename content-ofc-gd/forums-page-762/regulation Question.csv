404226,Paully,2009-11-20 19:09:00,712,From what i read in the regulations it say that the rouge river is closed from sept. 30 for trout anywhere from hwy 2 north. I was in the area  today and seen 2 fellows in full trout gear fishin a few clicks north of hwy 2..  am i mistaken or were they fishin out of bounds??
404232,Spiel,2009-11-20 19:25:00,9065,"Personally I've never fished there but the regs say all is kosher.....   Rainbow Trout, Brown Trout and Pacific Salmon Extended Fall Season (4th Sat. in Apr. to Dec. 31)  Rouge River - from Hwy. 2 in the City of Toronto upstream to the south side of Hwy. 407 in the Town of Markham"
