The same hole where i had lost four fish the week before due to crappy leader line. The water was much lower and there was less fish,but i managed to catch this beauty i know its hard to tell the size in the pic but its close to 30 inch after about and hr of trying a few different baits and approaches. I started bottom bouncing then switched to a float with a berkley power bait pink worm. I stayed there for about another hour then decided to move upstream. where there had been some action a few days before,but there was no fish to be found for the rest of the day except one small 8 incher. Hoping they get some considerable rain the next day or two so i can get another shot in before it gets cold.fish on tightlines.by the way the fish was released to go do her thing "
