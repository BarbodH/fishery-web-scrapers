403353,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-18 05:14:00,0,I bought a camcorder the other day so i'm attempting to learn to do some basic videos with music for practice.  Took some fishing photos and a video and threw it to music.  Most of the pics are recent so some of you have likely seen them on this page.  They feature a few of my best fishing buds.  Cheers and enjoy!

404025,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 02:07:00,0,Great Vid but the music's gotta go.lol
404028,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-20 02:10:00,0, it's hard to find music about fishing! i'm not really a country fan but any song about beer+fishing is cool with me!
404031,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-20 02:14:00,0,"It doesn't necessarily have to be about fishing. Just music that gets the adrenalin goin, cuz thats what fishin is all about! Beer+fishing for me = no fish.lol"
