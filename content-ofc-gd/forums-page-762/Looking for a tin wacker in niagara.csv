404487,jasonl,2009-11-21 17:00:00,29,I'm in the process of finishing my basement and am looking for a tin wacker to re-run my duct work who needs a side job. I'm an electrician and am willing to trades services or pay cash. I'll be flying home in about 2 weeks and would like some prices. Anyone interested pm me for details!!!
