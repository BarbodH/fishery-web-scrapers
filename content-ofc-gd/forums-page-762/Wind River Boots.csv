Great sole . rated for -70deg. and on sale for $89.00 These boots do not have a steel toe (made sure of that!) Any comments would be apreciated . Thanx Gil"

404169,bridge,2009-11-20 16:08:00,54,"i bought one pair about 5 or 6 years ago, which are now my garden boots.  i just bought another.  if its not cold enough outside your feet will sweat."

404263,Fisherpete,2009-11-20 21:17:00,1814,"I just picked up a pair of Wind Rivers too, they had the -100 model on sale from $139 down to $109, and I got a coupon in my flyers for another $10 off... so $99. Not bad at all! I was going to just grab another pair of the rubber minus 40 rated Kamiks that did me really well for the past 6 years - and with that same coupon I could have got them for a measly $25!!!! But I chose to go with the better ones, since I plan on fishing the hell out of Simcoe this winter... gonna get me a 15lb laker come hell or high water!"
