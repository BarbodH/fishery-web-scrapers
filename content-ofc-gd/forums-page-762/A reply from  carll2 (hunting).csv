403865,hotrod,2009-11-19 18:40:00,103,"I believe you can't legislate morality or ethics. As mentioned the hunter safety course addresses shot placement. Those who will take less than optimal shots will do so regardless of the fact that they took a course, like many do who hunt with a gun despite the fact they have all passed a course telling them not to. I'm against more rules, we already have enough and adding more will just turn more people off hunting like the gun registry did...."
403867,fishermccann,2009-11-19 18:48:00,655,"You need a PAL to by a gun, I think that you should need a Pal  to buy a bow. Just incorperate  a section of the PAL  course for bows. You would still need your hunter safty course anyhow."
403877,anonymous,2009-11-19 19:16:00,58,"There is an existing International Bowhunters course. It is mandatory in some province's as well as several countries around the world. It wouldn't surprise me if Ontario brought this into play in the next decade. The hunter's ed course in Ontario does cover shot placement, but only briefly touches on bow hunting. Just the same it briefly covers firearms as well. The hunter safety course was revamped to ensure that you as a hunter can safely get in and out of the woods, survive if you get lost as well as make sure you identify your game and ensure you can safely take the shot. In the past the hunter safety course focused more on the tools used to harvest game, but as of late those topics are being covered by the CFSC for firearms and nothing for archery.  Just for interest sake, anyone who has a valid PAL, POL or RPAL has an H1 designation on their outdoors card allowing them to hunt with firearms. People who have done the hunter safety course but do not have a firearms license have an H2 endorsement on their outdoors card which means they can only hunt with archery."
403910,misfish,2009-11-19 21:32:00,29133,Thanks for all the replys so far guys. Good points from both sides.
403920,Twocoda,2009-11-19 21:58:00,4130, interesting for sure...i thought my card was just saying HI everytime i looked at it
403942,Big Cliff,2009-11-19 22:27:00,6899,"You are right, @ 20 yards a crossbow is as easy as having a gun in your hands, in fact I think it is deadlier. The skill part comes in getting to within 20 yards. I see lots of guys during the gun hunt taking 80+ yard shots. I get one shot, they will unload their gun.  Each to their own I guess."
404064,ch312,2009-11-20 04:39:00,1590," i disagree with this entire post except when you said everyone should be aiming for vitals.  first, anyone taking shots at deer with a bow out to 60 yards has no clue what ethical hunting is about. at that range the deer has plenty of time to jump the string resulting in a bad hit.  i fail to understand why you think a crossbow is so much easier than a bow. you can have a compound drawn and beginning to aim by the time someone gets a crossbow up and looks through the scope. with both types of bows you need to wait for the animal to look away before drawing. scent control, stealth, and aim are critical with both bows.  lastly...compounds are light and take a bit of practice. crossbows are heavy and its awkward shooting off hand. both require practice to be good enough for hunting situations."
403607,misfish,2009-11-18 23:40:00,29133,"In a thread by our own Leechman,I was surprised to fined out that in Quebec,you need to pass a course for bow hunting.  First comment from Carll2   My question   From Carll2        Here in Ontario,we dont have this,BUT,I think this would be a great thing.Not as a cash grab,but as making sure we all know how, when and where the perfect shot ,should be taken. We all know here (Ontario),we can buy a bow ,and just head out after buying a tag.  Your thoughts please.  Myself like said,I can see a positive from this.As long as we dont make it a cash grab."
403612,Jonny,2009-11-18 23:48:00,1380," It couldn't help but cost you cash for a course and more cash for an endorsement on your Outdoors Card.  I am against any special class of hunting license, including the current one for turkey."
403613,irishfield,2009-11-19 00:56:00,26272,"Brian are you saying that if I already have a bow... that I don't need a hunting course/PAL/whatever and I can go down to Minnising, as a land owner, and just get a tag to bag that HUGE buck Marty's chasin around down in the swamp??"
403616,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-19 01:02:00,348,
403619,richyb,2009-11-19 01:05:00,774,I dont see the point. We already have to take a hunting course to be able to buy a deer tag and it covers pretty much anything you need to hunt anyways. If your a gun hunter you know where to shoot a deer. WE dont need any more rules.
403635,Sinker,2009-11-19 01:34:00,8692,In NFLD you have to shoot targets to get a moose license. My old man was surprised with that when he went. I don't really see the point in a bow license though.  S.
403644,misfish,2009-11-19 01:43:00,29133,"Guess what Im getting at is this.  Yes we gun hunters know,ok. But those that are just hunting with a bow(no hunting experince),this IMO would be a good idea."
403646,irishfield,2009-11-19 01:45:00,26272,Brian.. look up.. it was a serious question!
403650,misfish,2009-11-19 01:53:00,29133," Yes you need to take the hunters ed course,  Wayne.  Your point is?"
403651,richyb,2009-11-19 01:53:00,774,Doesnt the basic hunting course cover ethical shots ?  Its not like just anyone is grabbing a bow and shooting up the woods. You still need the hunter education to be able to get a small game license.
403653,irishfield,2009-11-19 01:56:00,26272, Sounded like you were stating we didn't need anything to hunt with a bow. If you have to take a hunters course then you should be good. Can you imagine if we needed to take an extra fishing course to get our licence if we wanted to jig vs troll?
403657,misfish,2009-11-19 02:01:00,29133,"  Yes it does,but what says, they are good enough to take that shot with a bow? Totally different game as you well know Richy."
403660,misfish,2009-11-19 02:03:00,29133," Thankfully ,you have Terry to catch yer fish for ya.LOL"
403661,richyb,2009-11-19 02:04:00,774,Some of those big fancy outfitters make the guys shoot their bows before they go out to make sure they are a decent shot or they wont let them hunt.  Just wait untill you need a PAL to buy a X-bow. Then lets hear the pissin !
403662,Twocoda,2009-11-19 02:05:00,4130," good point Rich....does quebec have to take a provincial hunters safety course? ive been hunting almost my whole life...leave the province for a few years ...come back and then i have to take a course?!?!..what the hell...thats like trying to tell Babe Ruth he has to learn to play ""T"" ball before he can play baseball in yankee stadium..."
403682,Big Cliff,2009-11-19 02:25:00,6899,"Every shot I take at a deer with my cross bow costs me about $15.00 just for the heads I use. Once fired they are usually so mangled they have to be replaced. Believe me I make sure I can hit what I am shooting at and if I can't get a good clean shot, I just don't take it. In the past 10 years I haven't lost one deer that I've shot at and the farthest any thing has gone after shooting it with the cross bow was about 70 yards in about 10 seconds and it was dead.  By the time I pay for my out door card, fishing license, hunting license, turkey, bear, deer, moose licenses and my gear. Hunting already costs me plenty, I really can't aford any more cash grabs."
403684,carll2,2009-11-19 02:27:00,443,yep to hunt with a gun we need to take a safety course then if you want to bow hunt or crossbow you need  another completely different course...i think its a great idea to have a mandatory bow course since its  100% more technical than hunting with a gun and the shots are way harder(from what ive seen)
403689,carll2,2009-11-19 02:33:00,443,keep in mind guys that not everybody out there is as carefull about taking uncertain shots...     http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/publica...asp#certificate
403692,richyb,2009-11-19 02:43:00,774,"Gun or Bow its the same vitals your aiming at. Your taking the same shot just with a different weapon. Archery is just tougher because you have to be within 60 yards No offence to the crossbow guys but at 20 yards, a crossbow is as easy as having a gun in your hands. Not much skill involved. The only thing that a seperate course could teach someone is that they cant pick up a compound bow and expect to be good, you have to practice."
403694,Skud,2009-11-19 02:43:00,739,"I believe this course will become mandatory in Ontario soon enough.  The Wolf's Den has been offering this course for a while now. It is $150 for a day course. Those who take it are heading to a foreign land to hunt and it is require by that country, state or province.  Those who travel abroad to hunt have too much money to start with so what's another $150. I will only take it when I have to."
403715,Jonny,2009-11-19 03:56:00,1380,"The basic hunter safety course covers everything it needs to.  Anybody who goes hunting without having practiced - whether with gun or with bow - is a fool.  As far as I know there's very few of that kind of fool around. Everybody likes to target practice when they're new to the sport.  Whatever numbskull thought up the wild turkey course never paid any attention to the fact that duck hunting has a much steeper learning curve and requires no special course.  (Of course the wild turkey requirement was put in there to limit the number of wild turkey hunters, not because it requires extra-special proficiency.)"
403761,Jay T,2009-11-19 13:12:00,282,"When I first started Bow Hunting, I took the Bow Hunter Safety Course (15yrs ago) and I really enjoyed it. It is not the same as the hunter safety course, yes some similarities, but a lot more about shot placements, tree stand safety, tracking, broadhead saftey and sharpness, the list goes on. When it was time for the field test it was a full day out with all the guys and going through the whole scenario of shooting an animal and tracking ect.. Then a fun 3-D shoot at the end with a steel deer with a 3"" hole to try and shoot through at 40yrds or so. With this course I can hunt anywhere in the world with my compound bow, some places you have to have it to be able to hunt.  It wasn't $150 back then, I think it was $50. I did it just to be more knowledgeable about bow hunting.  I wouldn't be against it if it did come into affect.  That's my 2 cents"
403818,Leecher,2009-11-19 17:08:00,7832,Yeah in Quebec there's courses for every type of hunting..... now you know why I only riffle hunt Jacques
403858,Jonny,2009-11-19 18:28:00,1380," Nothing wrong with a course. It's actually a good idea for some people as long as it isn't mandatory. I'd say the same about duck hunting.  Having to have a course because of hunting outside the country... that's a specialized thing and has to be different. You're playing by somebody else's rules.  The best way to get into bowhunting is to get to know people who do it. And you can also educate yourself massively by reading - especially on the internet.  Actually when I got into bowhunting I already knew all the basics of big game hunting - shot placement, tree stands, etc. etc. What I needed was familarity with the equipment and its capabilities. Some target shooting sessions worked that up just fine."
403863,Harrison,2009-11-19 18:36:00,2202,"I am not sure about a course, but maybe more education could be published in and around the ethics of bow hunting.  For a couple months before the season I practice with my compound from tree stand heights.  I also bring the target with me to my stands and shoot each different laneway at the target.  Afterwards I mark with trail tape the pin/yardage I used by the target for the kill shot.  Sounds maybe alittle extreme, but it is EASY to be fooled by distances.  And it is deflating to have everything fall into place after so much effort to miss an animal for lack of prep or practice.  That being said, no matter how much prep and practice, things happen.  It works for me and I have vital shot every animal after doing so.  Before I had a tendency to tickle their bellies with the arrow"
