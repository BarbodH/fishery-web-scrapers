Up to this morning I was starting to get really frustrated (6 consecutive skunks in a row), and everyone I was talking to was telling me that I was doing everything right, and fishing in the right places.  I guess Thursdays rain was the key as I was seeing a lot more fish in the river, and I was starting to see some actual hook ups.  This guy slammed a roe bag and even showed me a little aerial action as well.  I was so nervous that I was going to lose it by the shore that I nearly went face first into the creek jumping down the bank.  Sorry for the bad cell phone pic:     15 minutes later I landed a second, slightly bigger, with the same beautiful silver shine.  Whats a better way to celebrate this huge load off my chest than my favourite brew, and some lunch!    I'm officially addicted, what a rush.  I can't wait to get out and do it all again"
