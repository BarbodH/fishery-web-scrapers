404549,irishfield,2009-11-21 23:56:00,26272,Well if you think it was snagged... then legally they couldn't keep it.. no matter what the release outcome.
404552,SBCregal,2009-11-22 00:00:00,688,very good point!
404556,vinnimon,2009-11-22 00:06:00,2593,"I know it was snagged,fresh blood on one fillet and a scar to match,they should think about mother nature taking its coarse.Let her go take a handfull and send her on its way."
404558,vinnimon,2009-11-22 00:09:00,2593,They didnt keep it because i caught it.
