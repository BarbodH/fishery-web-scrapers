404429,vinnimon,2009-11-21 04:50:00,2593,Thanks again for everyones input.got to rest up niagara is waiting for me.i ll post later on my expedition for the niagara bow.
404434,bigfish1965,2009-11-21 05:29:00,3382,"  You do not need to report the fish and with the new culling laws, if you kill one after your limit is reached you SHOULD cull a live fish for your dead one where allowed. And yes, there is a limit on roe. You may possess the roe from as many fish of that species you are allowed to possess. The possession laws mention fish or any part of a fish. So if you have fifty pounds of roe, you are in deep do-do. Stripping a fish and releasing can get you a fish molestation charge. And if it doesn't, it is a fish in possession in any event since it is part of that fish."
404441,NAC,2009-11-21 10:57:00,369,"Now every time I land a hen with eggs, I'm gonna think of the word ""molestation""."
404542,vinnimon,2009-11-21 23:25:00,2593,"This fish was tired.all in all the fillets were free of the silver lining.A good one that was molested by others.The guy next to me caught one and her belly was full,as per the others I saw."
404547,vinnimon,2009-11-21 23:52:00,2593,
404550,bigfish1965,2009-11-21 23:58:00,3382,"Once you have your limit and are not permitted to cull, you MUST release the fish, no matter what shape it is in. Otherwise every poacher would just keep jiggiing up walleye out of 40 feet of water and giving them a little squeeze which blows their stomach out of their mouth and claiming it was dead so he had to keep it."
404568,vinnimon,2009-11-22 00:39:00,2593,
404378,vinnimon,2009-11-21 02:45:00,2593,"Im not sure but there must a stipulation somewhere.Is there a limit on how much roe a person can posses without a vendors permit.We can catch our limit per day and keep the roe for personal use,but is there a limit?and to add on are brook roe trout legal to sell by a vendor in ont?from stocked fish or not?This is just a general question,and not directed towards anyone at all.Looking to fill the fridge if the bows are willing.cheers."
404381,Twocoda,2009-11-21 02:54:00,4130,if you take the roe from a fish ...your obligated to take that fish home with you so it applies towards your limit...
404383,misfish,2009-11-21 02:56:00,29133,"We can catch our limit per day and keep the roe for personal use,but is there a limit?   Im sure in the near future,there will be. Im sure it,s next on the list.  How much roe can one angler need? Really.One salmon,one bow and brown.Enough for say 3-4 years? If cured right.  Unless yer name is SOLO."
404384,BillM,2009-11-21 02:58:00,17367," I'm pretty sure you can milk a fish, return it and have it's roe count as one fish towards your limit.  You are not required to keep the fish."
404385,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:00:00,2593,"That I know,you cant strip the fish and let it go.What I was wondering,if there is an actuall amount of roe a person can keep for personal use in there possesion at one time.just something that came across my mind."
404389,misfish,2009-11-21 03:04:00,29133, Please explain this Bill.
404391,Twocoda,2009-11-21 03:05:00,4130, im pretty sure you are
404393,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:07:00,2593,"Thanks guys,I think aweight limit on roe should be applied,counted as a fish caught and kept.And as for brook trout roe,is it legal to sell?  Some were offered a few weeks back,I hesitated on it.Since there are not many in my neck of the woods."
404398,irishfield,2009-11-21 03:14:00,26272,From the OMNR website   Live release isn't probably considered discarded or wasted..... but because you molested it it will count against your daily possession limit.  The guy that was selling brown trout roe was from a commercial trout farm.. with a licence to do so.. or so he stated.
404399,BillM,2009-11-21 03:17:00,17367,  I guess you can interpret this in a few ways...  Got it off the MNR site. 
404400,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:17:00,2593,"From what I understand you cant strip a fish of its roe and let it go.What I used to do is take a handfull,that is if the fish is not stressed,and she is letting the eggs go on her own terms.Too often I see shopping bags full of eggs and no fish in hand to show for.But in the same manner I can walk the shore and take my pick for lunch."
404402,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:22:00,2593,
404403,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:32:00,2593,"So if your a newbie and you catch a fish not knowing,you keep the eggs and let the fish go,it swims away,but later is found a float by another angler.Then what?It would be wasted in my mind.and discarded?Where can you draw the line.I take my girls out and when in doubt do the humane thing regardless.report it."
404405,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:38:00,2593,Thanks again for all the inputs.vinnimon.To the niagara I will go need some roe and someting on the barbie(BBQ)  Well maybe ill bring barbie
404406,BillM,2009-11-21 03:38:00,17367," If you are a newbie and don't know what you are doing, you shouldn't be milking fish.  It doesn't take that long to milk a fish and get it back in the water.  NY however requires you to keep a fish if you plan on keeping the eggs..  Ontario doesn't."
404409,Twocoda,2009-11-21 03:53:00,4130,Thanks Bill ...seems i learn something new everyday...not that its ever been an issue with me ....if i keep the eggs i keep the fish too....(including black scabby salmon hens)...
404410,fishinguypat,2009-11-21 03:54:00,547,any fish you take eggs from is counted towards your limit ...so if you take roe from 2 steelhead that is your limit for that day
404411,vinnimon,2009-11-21 03:56:00,2593,"Im not a newbie at all,I was implying about guys that dont see the signs that the fish is not going to make it.2 summers ago fishing a live release tourney at conestogo lake, I got second place in a pike tourney pending live release.1/2hr in the rain to let it go with confidence.It will breed again."
404412,BillM,2009-11-21 04:01:00,17367,  Gross!!!!  lol
404413,vinnimon,2009-11-21 04:02:00,2593,"My rule of thumb is if i KEEP THE EGGS THE FISH IS KEPT, AND ,AND CONSUMED.NOT THROWN OUT.9 out of 10 times the fish goes home to their youngins."
404416,vinnimon,2009-11-21 04:06:00,2593,"I caught a scabby rotten female at st kits a few years back,full of roe but some greenish ooze coming out of it."
404417,fishinguypat,2009-11-21 04:09:00,547,in that situation cutting belly fat.... may turn  a 20 lb fish into 1 lb of meat lol!
404418,BillM,2009-11-21 04:14:00,17367," I'd much rather let the fish go to spawn another day, then use it as table fare  But to each their own."
404419,vinnimon,2009-11-21 04:15:00,2593,"I think the greenish ooze was the meat.The grossest thing I ever saw.It was worse than a freshdead skunk,except this fish hit my line and swam while roting away.I need a bucket now."
404421,Twocoda,2009-11-21 04:22:00,4130,  yeah but the dog doesnt mind ...when its prepared right ...( i dont think the dog is going to miss it )  ive been searching the regs to find what led me to believe you were obligated to keep the fish ...so far i cant find anything ....  heres another one ...  ive always believed ....after having your limit of fish ...you are DONE.... because as soon as you connect to the next fish this puts you illegal because the fish is now in your possession...  reading the ministry page it says you can continue to fish ....but immediate release....
