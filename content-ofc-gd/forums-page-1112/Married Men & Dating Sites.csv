140064,Fishingfever,2007-12-06 14:49:00,27,"Hi all,  my girlfriend and I were watching a documentary a few days ago.  The program was on Singles Dating Sites.  They talked about the importance of asking questions to people you meet, don't be so trusting, there are alotta fakes. Men or women can pretend to be something theyre not.  The program tracked these men down and tried to interview them.  They were on tv for everyone to see.  They posted their pictures and profiles from different dating sites they were on.  Some duped women for money,etc. This hit home for my girlfriend.  She had been on an online dating site for SINGLES before we met.  She had met some nice guys that were honest and caring individuals.  She did date a guy who posed as a single dad.  He told her where he worked all about his kids,etc.   She found he forgot to mention that he was married,lol. We are on a family website and saw he had posted on a forum, where he talked about him and his wife and made it sound like he was a real family guy.  He talked about how he had found the ultimate woman,lol.  (If he did why is he hunting for other women) If youre unhappy in your marriage leave or  tell the people your dating just that. We both feel it's good that programs do educate people on whats happening out there, it makes people more aware.  Moral of this post:  Take responsibily when being online. If someone can not give out their home address or home phone# If they can only call you in the morning or during work hours They can't get together on weekends or evenings  These are red flags that should tell you somethings not right no matter what excuses they come up with!"

140195,Bly,2007-12-06 21:02:00,1556, This from the guy with no fishing reports
140204,JohnF,2007-12-06 21:59:00,3494," Yeah! My son says that a guitar is a chick magnet, even better than Mom's BMW convertible when you're seventeen. His guitar (actually a bass) seems to have served him well over the years. It has nothing to do, I'm sure, with him being 6'5 and looking like a young me (oops, I can't believe I just said that).  Real men don't need no steenkin' fish reports. They just need a guitar. The wimmen get all weak-kneed over that. The BMW is just icing on the cake. We used MG's and Austin Healeys in my day, and banjoes. I still have the banjo - long neck 5 string. Some day I fully intend to learn to play the durned thang.  JF"

140344,Crazyhook,2007-12-07 12:57:00,1154,"you mean everyone on the internet is not who they say they are???  honestly, there are many people out there who like to scam people, you have to watch out on line or in the real world"
