140218,HTHM,2007-12-06 22:58:00,4082,What about prizes for those of us that can't afford satilite or cable?
140347,cranks bait,2007-12-07 13:20:00,721," I think you might be right on that Wayne.  She's already asked me to find her a pink tackle box for ""her stuff"" .  Dave couldn't have picked a better person to win.  My wife is a closet fishergirl, by winning this contest it has given her the confindence to go out and land some big smallies with me  What a great way to get another person involved with fishing"
