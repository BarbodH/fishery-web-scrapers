I'm sure Dave's going to send out a press release when he finally has some free time, but I thought I'd let ya's all know that The Facts of Fishing has a slick new website to go along with the new show.  Everybody gets to share thier creative work on OFC, so here's my chance to share some of my editing work to those who don't have WFN.  Dave's got a ton of other content as well, all his tips, a ton of video, photos, wallapers, news, his blog, the list goes on and on.  Pair it up with OFC and you've got a whole afternoon's worth of things to do on the NET white at work! hehe  Let us know what you think!  Cheers, Ryan  Daves New Website"

Had to laugh as I had the speakers on (normally I don't) and heard Dave's laugh as soon as I got there.  Took a while to figure out it was because I had my mouse over his head.
