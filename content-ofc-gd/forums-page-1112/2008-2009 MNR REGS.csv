138603,bowshep,2007-12-01 22:12:00,378,aniceguy. So we have to do it one at a time. One on one and preach. Some people you cant change its only unless they want to. So the regs don't cut it this year and next. l personally would like a rotating all out ban on a river and total ban on sod farms sucking it right out of the rivers and its pollution for the thank you note. We have to shoot for the 2010 regs now. With a bombardment of emails to the MNR just need someone to lead the pack. l will help. Ken  Note: The river ban was something that Uncle Millty mentioned.
138612,bucktail,2007-12-01 22:50:00,1857,Nice to see protection for pike in geo Bay and walleye. But I thought the St Lawrence muskie minimum was 54 not 48?
138643,Fisherman,2007-12-02 00:44:00,7201,"Either my comprehension level has plummeted drastically or it's an error, Zone 16 pg 80 Rainbow, Brown and Pacific Salmon listed as open all year round from Notty/Boyne downstream(north to GBay) understand that no problem, then on pg 82 it says from the Notty/Boyne to the Pine, within that zone, Sport licence - 0, Conservation licence -0.  If it's open on page 80(like it has been for as long as I can remember in previous years), then why indicate otherwise on the next page?  Is this a catch and release only zone?  Somethings not right, either or, leave it open or close it all the way up to the Pine, none of this C&R crap and damage the fish anyway."

139021,RHYBAK,2007-12-03 13:25:00,21,To me it also looked like there was no longer an extended fall Rainbow season on the Bighead?????
139030,aniceguy,2007-12-03 13:59:00,1094,"lots of strange things in this new regulatory package.  Notty no kill is a good one some oare horrific though.  Bowshep the good old drainage tile ace from the early part of this century needs to be revised for sure.  Lots of things come from the days where conservation water quailty, sustainable fisheries etc.. were not taken into account.  The science in the vast majority is there and undisupted yet OMNR still wont do the right thing upfront but would rather take baby steps in order to not get one group up in arms.."
139094,fish_finder,2007-12-03 17:17:00,370," That was the first thing I checked as well, sadness.......   Really hoping its a misprint or something"

139210,Paulus,2007-12-03 22:11:00,522,"Looks like the site is down, or else they heard all the complaining & decided to take it offline so they could fix things. I can't even get to the document from where I'm sitting. ""404 page not found,"" like so many other government services...  p.-  5 minutes later.... I just googled them & looked at the ""cached"" version of the OMNR publications website & they have definitely taken down the new regs. So the Bighead is back in business, boys!  p.-"
139211,irishfield,2007-12-03 22:17:00,26272,"Can't ""fix"" things when it's already in print. Took three years to put together and it appears people will still need to go online to get revisions/interpretations. Another Cluster ...."
139213,aniceguy,2007-12-03 22:23:00,1094,Regulatory changes can be done at any time over the course of a year regardless if they are in print or not
139217,irishfield,2007-12-03 22:26:00,26272,Sure they can Louis...they just don't help the poor bugger that picks up a Reg book in CTC and thinks he's good as gold...'till the CO writes him a fine! Make sure you give Donna a shoulder rub while you're there!
139306,aniceguy,2007-12-04 03:08:00,1094,I hear ya wayne but like they say ignorance is no excuse for the law
139311,irishfield,2007-12-04 03:18:00,26272,"Problem is..there is no ""ignorance"" when the guy thinks he's doing the right thing and reading a reg book supplied by the government. Only to find out later that it's not what they really meant! There should be no need to be checking the MNR website before each fishing outing. Kinda like showing Aurora trout are open...only to travel all the way to Temagami, walk into Dad's and ask Jim how to get to the appropriate lake only to be told you can't fish for them. Saw that three times in 2005/2006 (and I'm not in there that often..can't imagine how many actually headed up for it)."
139315,fishindevil,2007-12-04 03:29:00,6254,"I also see that limits of walleye in the ottawa river have dropped 1 ,to 5 as the new limit,and no fish over 15inches till june 15th...and the delayed the season 2 weeks till opener...its about time,we have told the MNR,that we still catch fish with eggs and spem in them several weeks after the opener,im always afraid to keep a fish the first few weeks after opener just for the rerason.....and sometimes its hard to tell the difference between the males & females...well at least it makes it a little better now,i can live with it no prob....cheers"

138080,DMASSE,2007-11-30 01:12:00,420,Hello OFNers  Just a quick note that Al Flaherty's Outdoor store on Dufferin Street has the new 2008-09 MNR fishing regs...  Some interesting changes and some new and good changes..  I am responding to about 15 PM's about the regs...  Drop by and grab one if your downtown TO  Dave
138167,Fish Farmer,2007-11-30 13:16:00,2234,Thanks for the heads up. I hope it's smaller and easier to read.
138204,mattyk,2007-11-30 15:22:00,2110,are they online yet?
138378,fish_finder,2007-11-30 23:54:00,370,Here's an online version!!  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fishing/...-Fish%20web.pdf  big file..
138383,irishfield,2007-11-30 23:59:00,26272,49 meg!  ...and 10 pages more than the old regs. Glad less zones = less regs. Haven't read it yet...but guessing the exemption pages are immense!
138388,fishindevil,2007-12-01 00:21:00,6254,"iGOT MINE TODAY AT GAGNONS SPORTS IN OSHAWA....THEY HAVE ABOUT 4 BOXES OF THEM,AND THEY ARE ALOT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND,AND PRETTY SIMPLE TOO....."
138390,ccmtcanada,2007-12-01 00:24:00,7971, I just browsed through the entire file.  It seems the 10 extra pages are exceptions...I dont think there are more...just that the printing is larger and much easier to read.
138393,irishfield,2007-12-01 00:28:00,26272,"Main thing I've noticed so far is the bass tourney guys are finally off the hook for the ""culling"" debate. "
138400,steverowbotham,2007-12-01 00:58:00,1800,"No more than six at a time, meaning that we catch our five, then keep fishing for our 6th fish, we still have to cull immediately, otherwise we're fishing for our 7th fish, no change there."
138401,irishfield,2007-12-01 01:02:00,26272,I also note that every winter outfitter / ice hut operators worst nightmare is now official as well. You can only fish Lake Trout for one month in the winter in all of zone 11.. with the exception of 11 lakes (only one of I've ever heard of ). Season is Feb 15th to 3rd Sunday in March. This reg use to only apply to Lake Temagami. Now it's the entire region from South of Nipissing (Northern Algonquin park boundry) all the way up to New Liskeard.
138402,irishfield,2007-12-01 01:07:00,26272," There is a change...they've put it in print and made it ""legal"". Before..technically you were beyond your daily possession limits by retaining them in your livewell and trading out fish as the day went on...with say 30 fish ""possessed"" thru the day. Now you're good as gold as long as you never have more than 5 in there at one time..even if you've ""possessed"" 200 for the day.  Next time around...maybe they'll include driving the boat thru the park to the weigh in...""technically"" illegally transporting fish over land. They should have covered that one too, so all the scuttlebutt is put to rest for good.  Note... I have no issues with any of the above. It's no different IMHO with the guy that catches and throws back 30 trout a day. The bass have a better chance of survival than any of the mentioned fish do..in a livewell."
138418,buttah,2007-12-01 02:24:00,11,So after sept. 30 there is no catch limit for nottawasaga steelhead between the boyne and the pine?Are you still allowed to catch and release??
138444,Burtess,2007-12-01 04:17:00,901,Nice to see they cut the limits for rainbow in Zone 16 down to 2 for sport and 1 for conservation  Burt
138450,fish_finder,2007-12-01 04:55:00,370,many opportunties have been lost in this edition of the regs...
138462,EC1,2007-12-01 06:02:00,930,thanks for sharing! ill check this out right away!
138464,fishinggeek,2007-12-01 06:30:00,325,I couldn't find the section that says no deadbait longer than 5.1 inches.  Is it in there?
138498,Sunny,2007-12-01 14:05:00,5,The restrictions for live and or dead baitfish are only for zone 18
138507,irishfield,2007-12-01 14:49:00,26272,No they're not! Lake Temagami also has the 5.1 inch limit now..and I bet there's more in there.
138510,ccmtcanada,2007-12-01 14:52:00,7971," Hey Shawn,  Thanks for stopping by last night and giving us a copy of the regs! It was great chatting with you....talk to you later bud.  Cliff"
138552,Milty,2007-12-01 18:34:00,121," I think Yes,..or else they would have made it a sanctuary, long time comin for that section of river.  I beleive its the same as muskie reg's of catch and possession of 0, but obviously can still fish for them."
138554,Milty,2007-12-01 18:36:00,121," It always was as far as i know,...it was just mixed in with the salmon limits, but you couldnt have more than 2 rainbow for for sport license before anyways."
138558,wallacio,2007-12-01 18:55:00,475,"Yes, only C&R will be permitted on the middle Notty.   Kudos to the Nottawasaga Steelheaders as well as others for pushing for this long overdue regulation as this section of river holds wintering steelhead which were vulnerable to over harvest.  Unfortunately with the new regs, there are (what I can only assume to be) glaring errors and omissions to FMZ 16.   The extended season as well as year-round season for steelhead on the Bighead are completely missing as is the year-round season for the lower Maitland and Saugeen (yet the extended season for the middle river for both still appears).   A number of extended seasons on some other minor tributaries seem to be missing as well.  I am going to contact the MNR about this issue and I encourage all other concerned steelheaders to do so as well."
