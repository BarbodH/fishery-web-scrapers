140108,ranger520vx,2007-12-06 17:14:00,164,The division Scugog is in is now 4 with only 1 over 18 inches.
140109,jeffw,2007-12-06 17:16:00,267,I'm pretty sure that you can now fish for crappie in the winter not 100% sure though. Cheers jeff
140237,Sinker,2007-12-07 00:25:00,8692," OK, but is it still 6 fish? That's no good......cause all the fish in the bog are under 18"".......  Sinker"
140274,fishindevil,2007-12-07 02:29:00,6254,"HEY ranger ,just to let you know that lake scugog is in region 17 now,they have been changed !!!!! its all on page 84.....so you might want to check it out"
140505,ranger520vx,2007-12-07 20:58:00,164,fishindevil- I see how my post was confusing..its like my mind these days.  Meant the new division (17) it is in allows 4 with only 1 over 18.
140516,steverowbotham,2007-12-07 21:46:00,1800,"no pickerel in the bog, but you can keep 4 walleye, with one over 18 inches."
140518,Sinker,2007-12-07 21:49:00,8692, Nonsense.....I've been  catching them in there for 20 years!!  Sinker
140576,Guest skeeter99,2007-12-08 00:32:00,0,"yep, it is going to be tough keeping fish this winter on the bog  4 walleye limit  3 under 18.1 inches and 1 over  so for me at least a outing on the bog is going to be 1 fish (i cannot catch anything under 18 through the ice)   crappie are open from jan 1 to last day of feb  sunfish? are open from jan 1 to last day of feb  **look at the exceptions on page 85** for lake scugog  so for the most part I will target crappies since they are very plentiful and quite large on the bog"
