140539,SlowPoke,2007-12-07 22:58:00,2984,"Hmmm, ideas. What about a brass cup brush on an angle grinder? Or would I benefit more from a low speed drill press?"
140540,irishfield,2007-12-07 23:00:00,26272,Probably work well. I've got an article around here on burnishing..just not sure where it is to see what the tool of choice really is.
140431,icefisherman,2007-12-07 16:02:00,952," It sure is getting close  That's why I am trying to do as much as I can before ...as who knows how much time I'll have after....  And my invitation still stands...infact a friend of mine will be here on Sunday with his soldering-iron on Sunday to help me out soldering the wires...So I'd say.....tomorrow is the day Brian....you and the wife...you know the place...just let me know the time  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
140490,SlowPoke,2007-12-07 19:52:00,2984,I get to work on my boat tomorrow! I have to get it ready for storage while I still can. The ice and snow is melting nicely today.
140493,irishfield,2007-12-07 19:58:00,26272,"Hey... Wayne's not a expert at anything!! He just knows how to do a lot of things well ! LOL  Wiring is one of them....    But Brian.. go knock yourself out, cause I ain't got time!  Emil is just afraid to drill any holes in his shiney new boat!"
140497,SlowPoke,2007-12-07 20:10:00,2984," Where does the tape deck go on that dash?  Emil, don't worry about drilling holes. If you make a mistake, that's where you put a rod holder."
140501,irishfield,2007-12-07 20:26:00,26272,DANG... didn't even realize I'm advertising to keep Cliff in employement in that shot. Free garbage bags!  Part of the other side... (shot while doing 80mph it appears - 1800 feet up)     Sounds like a very experienced statement Emil... get Brian to help you drill twice...
140504,icefisherman,2007-12-07 20:40:00,952,"Hey guys, I haven't got to the point of asking how to wire both batteries to be charged by the kicker motor. This will be in a separate post soon. By the time I am done I hope I don;t end up having more rod holders then rods  It is fact though Brian helped drilling the first holes into my old boat and mounting of pair of rod holders on it. But now 3 years later and more expereienced then ever we should do better Brian  Sooooooo.....when should I expect you with the Lady? Next weekend? You are not hiding her are you? Spaghetti out of this world and good imported beer are on the menu Wayne could come (of fly in) too ha ha ha...comparing notes helps alot.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
140523,SlowPoke,2007-12-07 22:15:00,2984," I don't know where you're getting those CTC garbage bags for free, they usual cost me about $40! I have had my share of experience working around holes that other people have drilled for accessories or by mistake. I'm pretty anal about it when I drill. In fact, when I mounted my VHF antenna I did it so it could be removed and utilize the holes for an additional set of 24"" tracks. I will probably move my 24's forward and replace them with 36's for the riggers and saltys. The 24's will be for front rod holders and a quick release VHF antenna mount. Now I just have to find a solution for all the holes in my fiberglass console. Do you have a source for brushed aluminium? I was thinking a thin gauge overlay glued on the surface. -Brian"
140525,irishfield,2007-12-07 22:20:00,26272,"You can ""burnish"" up a piece yourself pretty quickly in a drill press. Some really heavy scotchbrite pads on a mandrel (body work section CTC)...move your piece over equal amounts as you go..bring the pad down on it for a few turns..move..repeat."
140534,SlowPoke,2007-12-07 22:47:00,2984," I wouldn't bother with the front battery charging from the kicker. A good deep cycle battery should run your electric trolling motor all day. If you just wanted to connect anything else to it (VHF) it would last considerably longer. If you have your heart set on charging it you can add a battery switch.  I don't know when my wife and I could make it to your place. She works friday nights/saturday days and some sundays. I work Sundays. The next day we have off together is Dec. 23 and we'll be at Lake Simcoe. I haven't been hiding her but maybe I should! When I took her to the London swill, JohnF was hitting on her. It worked out well for everyone however - she was flattered and occupied with JohnF while I could talk about fishing with the guys who actually do fish!! We'll get together one of these days! -Brian"
