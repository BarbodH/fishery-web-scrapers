138913,Tom McCutcheon,2007-12-02 23:55:00,627,"Just a question. Has anyone used their boats GPS/fishfinder in the winter for ice fishing? I have a Lowrance 522C with the GPS chip and wish to mount it on the front of an ATV. Only the GPS would be powered from the atv battery, the transducer connection would not be used. I am asking this because the instruction manual states it is operable to -28C, thats darn cold but I don't want to end up with an $800. paperweight. Your thoughts are appreciated Thanks Tom."
138914,fishindevil,2007-12-02 23:58:00,6254,"Well you can always purchase a nice handheld model,and they work great and you can get all the mapping,and downloads too,i would not risk doing that to my expensive graph !!! no way...i use my handheld alot,and you can take it anywhere,you should consider all options before risking your good unit,goo-luck,the members will have lots of ideas too..."
138915,Terry,2007-12-02 23:58:00,14456,yup  it will work fine do it every year
138925,irishfield,2007-12-03 00:16:00,26272,No issues. Note I leave my Hummingbird Matrix 10 in the cottage all winter up in Temagami...power is turned off = no heat.
139797,Tom McCutcheon,2007-12-05 13:09:00,627,"Thanks for the replies. Sorry I am so late responding I am on dial-up and only check in every couple of days, very frustrating at times. I do have a hand held unit without the mapping capacity but wish to try and keep both hands on the helm of the bike (so to speak).  Tom"
139816,irishfield,2007-12-05 14:19:00,26272,Also consider darn near every new car out there has an LCD screen in them for navigation. Not eveyone is parking in a heated garage.
139821,keram,2007-12-05 14:34:00,585," It is true, but they probably use so called ""Low-temperature poly-silicon TFT LCD"", or internal LCD heater."
139862,Canuck2fan,2007-12-05 16:42:00,1444," I have to agree with that. Also, I don't know what kind the outside LCD screens that are all the rage at Tim Hortons are, but they also seem to work just fine no matter what the weather is outside. If they have some sort of heater or what but the other day the wind was frigid blasting a mere 80kph and the screen was working flawlessly even though the snow was piled right up to about an inch over the start of the screen on the outside of the casing. So some screens seem to work in just about any condition."
139879,keram,2007-12-05 17:25:00,585,There is no point to speculate. Just call them and ask.
139883,irishfield,2007-12-05 17:27:00,26272,Pretty sure my Lowrance specs stated to -26C
139901,Uncle Buck,2007-12-05 18:19:00,1000,if your lcd starts to lag or dissappear get a heat pack and tape it or use an elastic to attach it to the back of the fish finder...  i took my fishfinder out once and lost the display  a heat pack keeps it from freezing... tip i heard for using your fishfinder on the ice...
139924,fishinfool,2007-12-05 20:54:00,366,"I have a  Garmin eTrex Legend for sale. It is still in the box. I played with it for a couple of hours but never used it for anything. Now I have my Garmin Nuvi 360 so... PM me if you are interested, I will let it go for cheap.  Stan"
140528,Tom McCutcheon,2007-12-07 22:30:00,627,Thanks again guys for the responses. I will try to get in touch with the Techs. at Lowrance and run it by them. I will let you know the results when I get through to them. Tom.
