139800,Mike the Pike,2007-12-05 13:15:00,3421,Well I haven't been around much the last 2 days as we have been getiing too much snow here in the Montreal area.Close to 40cms so far and more to come this week.  All my spare time has been devoted to snow removal  I don't know what I would do without a snowblower.Feels like we got more snow in 2 days than all of last winter.  Anyone else also getting buried.Thats livin in Canada            MTP
139803,Greencoachdog,2007-12-05 13:33:00,8163,"That really doesn't look like too much snow for Canada Mike, actually it looks pretty meager. It needs to be about twice that deep to be picturesque."
139804,ccmtcanada,2007-12-05 13:34:00,7971,Wow...you guys got a lot more than we did.  I have about 10cm of that white stuff on my lawn and that's about it!
139807,cranks bait,2007-12-05 13:35:00,721,"Ahhh, that's what winter is supposed to be like.    If it's gonna be cold, might as well have snow to slide on and ice to climb on.  Oh and I guess ice to fish on as well    ."
139813,hawkeye,2007-12-05 13:45:00,162,"These ""snow squalls"" can do you in. Got home Tuesday around 5PM and 15 cm of snow in the driveway. OK I say not really bad BUT my driveway got plowed at 1PM  If these are snow squalls I'd hate to see a snow storm"
139822,Terry,2007-12-05 14:37:00,14456,I think I have  pushed more snow this year then I did all last year  I am ready for a break..I think I here Fla. calling to me.....
139824,irishfield,2007-12-05 14:43:00,26272,All I know is I can't get the boat into the launch at Pete Peterson for one last Muskie outing on GBay. Think the buggers would plow it... just to be nice! lol
139826,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-05 14:47:00,957,"How about holding off with your lies and photo shopped pictures about cold weather as my 100 United States Senators are in session to combat man caused global warming.  They are convening inside because Washington D.C. is covered with snow today.  See them live on C-SPAN2, channel 351 on DirecTV."
139835,Roy,2007-12-05 15:07:00,13728,This is from my kitchen door this morning.
139841,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-05 15:22:00,957,"Roy, you can't fool me.  I'll bet Terry did the photo for you."
139845,Greencoachdog,2007-12-05 15:29:00,8163, It just looks like somebody spilled their Pin'a Colada while basking in the sun to me Connie... and we're s'posed to feel sorry for them.
