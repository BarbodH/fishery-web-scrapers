It lands on a Tuesday so I will most likely be taking that week off work.  I am going to southbay and will see about renting a ice hut from an operator in the area I've used before. Good location too.  Not as crowded as Callander Bay gets.  I like it more peaceful. Pm me a message about costs.  I have room for 2 people and I have enough rods and tip-ups for us.  Just bring your lures, food, etc.   If anyone is interested post here or pm me.   Thanks.  P.S.  I will be leaving from Brampton.  Tony."
