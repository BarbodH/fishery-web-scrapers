140333,Marko,2007-12-07 12:22:00,854,Hey Guys i just bought a car yesterday. Person who sold it to me said that the E-test and the Safety were done 3-4 months ago. Now when I go to get my plates from the ministry am i going to have to do safety and E-test again or ones that the person who sold me the car did are still valid??  Thank you guys

140337,Jer,2007-12-07 12:27:00,1426,The E-test is good for 6 months I believe.  The safety will have expired...
140340,Marko,2007-12-07 12:31:00,854,Person said he was doing safety again today before he delivers the car. Thank you guys and ladies
140365,Oktravis,2007-12-07 14:11:00,62,F.Y.I. a provincal e-test is good for a year from the date on the paper work but you must have the original paper.if you lose the paper you need another test.  travis
140419,cisco,2007-12-07 15:39:00,597,Careful re the E-test since you cannot put a vehicle on the road when you buy used and the sucker don't pass the E-test. It must pass (Conditional passes won't work for a used car purchase). Careful not to buy a lawn ornament!
140433,Marko,2007-12-07 16:08:00,854,I just phoned the ministry of transportation and the lady said that the e-test is valid for a year and safety for 36 days. Car i got is a 2004 impala and the guy said he has the origianal papers for the e-test which is what i need and he is doing safety again today.  We`ll see how it turns out
140465,POLLIWOGG,2007-12-07 17:41:00,835,"If you got it private the e-test is good for the year but if its through a dealer it has to be done again, just a hidden tax grab."
