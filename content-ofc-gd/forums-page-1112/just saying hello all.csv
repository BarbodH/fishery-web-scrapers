139508,Hookset,2007-12-04 19:12:00,367,"Welcome, and sorry to hear about your friend.  You fish 7 days a week ? If you can't put more effort into it than that, then I guess 7 days a week will have to do. I mean come on... how much content can we expect if you only fish 7 out of 7 days, morning and night ? That's 7 afternoons you are missing there.  Try a little harder will ya ?   Hookset."

139776,Hawg Hunter,2007-12-05 12:01:00,204,"thanks for the warm welcome folks,some funny stuff there  ,right now the bays iced over WAIT a minute not safe ice just iced over,the walleye are hitting well at the ferry in picton good numbers and ranging from 2-14lbs,tons of 10 lbers,boat launch at the ferry is ok(from what im hearing anyway)  This area is always good from late oct to ice up as the walleye enter the bay from lake ontario to winter over and spawn in the spring,come feb there will be over 1 million walleye in the bay,good odds for a body of water 33 miles long and 1/4 mile wide on average.  Although im not great at this posting pics thing ill get my daughter lol to post some pics of last years fun  PLEASE check with local bait shops for SAFE ice conditions Carra Outdoor sports(613)966-0020 ask for Sam tell him Hawg Hunter sent you .Hes a good guy and he will tell you striaght up whats going on.

The group just finished up their BOQ get-together not too long ago.  hopefully you'll drop by next year - lots of good times I hear.  Funny how the kids know more about computers than the parents.  I don't think you're alone there.
