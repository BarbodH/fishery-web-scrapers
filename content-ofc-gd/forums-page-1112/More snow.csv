140338,Whopper,2007-12-07 12:29:00,2174,Excuse me but I think you people have misplaced some of the white stuff  Either that or a snowcone truck dumped it's load in my driveway this morning  What the heck is going on? We've had two snow falls in the same week  Would you all just inhale already
140369,Greencoachdog,2007-12-07 14:18:00,8163,Could y'all save some of that snow stuff and send it to me next August when I really need it?
