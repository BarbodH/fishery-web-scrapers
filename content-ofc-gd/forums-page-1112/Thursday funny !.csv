140110,irishfield,2007-12-06 17:20:00,26272,"One Sunday, in counting the money in the weekly offering, the Pastor of a small church found a pink envelope containing $1,000. It happened again the next week.  The following Sunday, he watched as the offering was collected and saw a little old lady put the distinctive pink envelope on the plate. This went on for weeks until the pastor, overcome by curiosity, approached her.  ""Ma'am, I couldn't help but notice that you put $1,000 a week in the collection plate,"" he  stated.  ""Why yes,"" she replied, ""every week my son sends me money, and  I give some of it to the church.""  The pastor replied, ""That's wonderful. But $1000 is a lot, are  you sure you can afford this? How much does  he send you?""  The little old lady said, ""$10,000 a week.""  The pastor was amazed. ""Your son is very successful; what does he do for a living?""  ""He is a veterinarian,"" she answered.  ""That's an honorable profession, but I had no idea they made that much money,"" the  pastor said.  ""Where does he practice?""  The little old lady said proudly, ""In Nevada.  He has two cat houses in Las Vegas, and one in Reno."""
