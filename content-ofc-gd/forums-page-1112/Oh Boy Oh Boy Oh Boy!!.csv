139711,irishfield,2007-12-05 03:04:00,26272,You tell me the answer Ryan... I'll claim the prize and well split it later !
139712,fishindevil,2007-12-05 03:05:00,6254,"Thats cool,where will we fill in the form TJ..??? will there be a special link,or a thread just for that?? im looking forward to watching his new show,as i was at the premier too,thanks to joey !!!   cheers"
139714,TJQ,2007-12-05 03:08:00,7806, Ill put the form up on a thread as soon as the episode is over!
139726,bassboy,2007-12-05 03:42:00,161,  Will said switches work with the distressview stuff Gerrit?   IIRC they wanted almost $90 for theirs.....  Thanks for the info!!  Bill
139854,TJQ,2007-12-05 15:52:00,7806,
139860,wuchikubo,2007-12-05 16:36:00,1114,"Okay, I have the channel but don't get off work until 7 pm (unless I can swing an early exit) and don't have a PVR. Does the show rerun the same night?"
139885,bassboy,2007-12-05 17:30:00,161,"Ignore my last question about the switch Gerritt...and thanks for the info.....need to look into this FTA stuff. Dont know too much about it but it seems quite popular. At any rate, I just ordered WFN. According to the really nice woman I just spoke to, the switch is no longer needed, and I should have WFN back in 2 hours or less. I know my wife is not going to be too happy and there will probably be tug-of-wars over the remote now, but since I hardly watch TV to begin with I think its ok. I think though that she will watch it too, but perhaps not as much as I might want to  Ok....bring on Dave Mercer!!!!!  Is the form posted yet TJ??  Bill"
139898,Terry,2007-12-05 18:07:00,14456,any SW-21 Multi Switch should work with expressvu to get both 91 and 82 you need 2 patch cords too..  but bell has moved them back to 91 so you should not need one..just order  wfn and you are good to go
139938,TJQ,2007-12-05 21:43:00,7806,"So.....   7 oclock on the WFN  get a pencil out cause the question is:  During the show, how many records does Dave hold??  "
139939,Terry,2007-12-05 21:49:00,14456,"I haven't seen records sense CDs came out but I guess Dave has some, but what he is doing with them in a fishing show god only knows"
139947,Gerritt,2007-12-05 22:29:00,6129,  Yup... Just ensure you get one for Echo...  AKA... D*shnet.  G.  Again your local FTA deal has em for 20 bux..  http://www.incrediblefta.com/switches.php   <---for example.  Gerritt.
139953,sonny,2007-12-05 22:50:00,511,"where's the forum going to be,,,,here,,or anouther thread?  dave's a great guy,,,can't wait to see the show!!!"

139436,irishfield,2007-12-04 16:28:00,26272,"WFN 419 disappeared from Bell Xpress view ! At least it did on mine, after they had it free again for awhile."
139437,tonyb,2007-12-04 16:28:00,1637,"Is there a ""No purchase necessary"" option for those of us who do not have WFN?  Is the show available on-line?  Tony"
139440,TJQ,2007-12-04 16:35:00,7806,The show is not online yet... I dunno what Dave's plans are... I recently signed up for the wfn package... it include the wfn and the fight network.. which if you like the MMA stuff is amazing.. plus a soccer channel.. and some other stuff.. i think it was like 5 bucks a month.. i watch it quite a bit...  If Im not mistaken theres alot of places cable included that carry the wfn network...
139441,tonyb,2007-12-04 16:38:00,1637,"Yeah I hear ya T.J.  Unfortunately it requires an upgrade to digital cable from my local cable company...too bad they don't have it on analogue cable, as it's almost double the price for digital...for just the 1 additional channel."
139442,motv8tr,2007-12-04 16:39:00,2587,I'll be watching again for sure!  It's GREAT!!!!  Heck I'd watch it again even without the contest   The trick will be to try to pay attention while laughing so hard  Maureen
139506,HTHM,2007-12-04 19:06:00,4082,Can I get it with an antenna?
139509,Terry,2007-12-04 19:13:00,14456,anyone have slingbox and could stream it to those that don't get the channel
139540,huntervasili,2007-12-04 20:28:00,1604,I will be watching it... Sounds Great TJ
139545,lovetofish,2007-12-04 20:46:00,500,OH MAN!!! i think my first free month of WFN just expired!!!
139546,Joey,2007-12-04 20:46:00,9122,"I'll be watching again.  I've been waiting for this premier since the sneak preview.  Don't miss it anyone, You'll be sorry!!!!  Joey"
139549,SlowPoke,2007-12-04 20:58:00,2984,I have the PVR set. Can you give us working stiffs time to watch it before the contest closes? -Brian
139551,misfish,2007-12-04 21:02:00,29133, GEEK
139554,TJQ,2007-12-04 21:05:00,7806, Not a problemo.. we will announce the winners the next day.. so long as you enter tomorrow nite or early morning is fine!
139577,silveradosheriff,2007-12-04 22:20:00,1025,Great contest - PVR is set!
139581,bassboy,2007-12-04 22:31:00,161," It did on mine too.  Before the free preview, I had called distressview to subscribe to WFN and they told me I needed to buy a piece of hardware (that they would refund me for later on. I asked why they couldnt just give it to me and told them that it sounded like a make work project for the accountants   )....a switch or something. 419 did not show up before the preview.  Then the free preview comes around and all of a sudden I can get WFN without having a switch.  Now that its gone (the free preview) I dont have 419 any more ( whereas other subscription channels I dont have DO show up in the listing when I use the show all channels format). This leads me to believe that I STILL need to buy the switch, even though they can give it to me free for the preview without the switch  :dunno:  It makes no sense to me but I am not going to go through the aggro so I can give them extra money per month.....I dont get it....  So I guess I wont be seeing it....and second the ""no purchase nessecary"" option  Bill"
139585,irishfield,2007-12-04 22:37:00,26272,"I had the free preview last fall/winter...then when it went subscription only, all summer, it was still there in the menu in Red. Then it went free again for the last month or more (thought maybe they where looking for more subscribers to cover their costs) and when I went to watch it the other day 419 was gone."
139587,motv8tr,2007-12-04 22:44:00,2587,"  They told me the same thing Bill, I said thanks but no thanks....a few months later, surprise surprise, it became available without me needing any additional equipment, funny how that happens.  I'd call again and ask for an explanation as to how they can add it one day but not the next.  Maureen"
139609,Gerritt,2007-12-04 23:10:00,6129,  Those Slingboxes are amazing! we have one setup at work  G
139613,Gerritt,2007-12-04 23:16:00,6129,"the more channels they broadcast from Nimiq 91 the more channels they are trying to cram into a limited amount of bandwidth/transponders.. so their response?? decrease the overall bit ratio to all channels.. there by degrading picture quality.. if they put ""premium channels"" and HD on 82 it opens up that available bandwidth there for increasing picture quality and an overall viewing experience for everyone..  PS... you can pick up a switch at any local FTA dealer for less the 20 bucks.  Gerritt."
139618,irishfield,2007-12-04 23:20:00,26272,Switch = forgot I already had a double feed.
139631,Dave Mercer,2007-12-04 23:42:00,148,"Hi Guys, Thanks for all your support. I hope you like THE SHOW . As far as I know you do not need a switch now but you did at the start. All you do is  just call Bell and they will hook you up. I look forward to all your feedback. Dave Mercer"
139676,bpsbassman,2007-12-05 01:14:00,941,I'm getting all tingly waiting for the show!!!!

139700,The Urban Fisherman,2007-12-05 02:21:00,2050,"Hey TJ - I'm going to go ahead and assume that I can't get in on this contest? haha  Hope you enjoy the show guys!  Cheers, Ryan"
