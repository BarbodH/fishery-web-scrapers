140074,huntervasili,2007-12-06 15:23:00,1604,"Hey all.... I was just wondering if anyone had some info on any frozen over lakes or decent spots... I am hopefully going to go friday but am not too sure of the ice conditions everywhere and wanted to figure out if I could go out... couple inches of good ice is good. I know there are a few good ones pretty close to frozen, if not ready to go in minden and was thinking abouth that but might even check out something closer... Any species, cabin fever is setting in! Feel free to PM me and if ya wanna try and hook-up that is awesome too. So any condition reports would be great... Might even consider simcoe in the shallows for perch (rope to the tree  ), guess I am gonna have to wait and see. Thanks in advance"
140076,douG,2007-12-06 15:32:00,2693,"A little early for this area, Mr. Parker.  Don't really want to see you on the Darwin Awards finalist list."
140078,huntervasili,2007-12-06 15:36:00,1604,"figure I will probly have to wait but I was wondering anyway, who knows... Might even take a drive to simcoe just to check it out..."
140086,Terry,2007-12-06 15:47:00,14456,"I would not want to go on simcoe yet  Haliburton, I hear the small lake are OK, but even then I would want to be with someone who knows the lake"
140102,jeffw,2007-12-06 17:00:00,267,you have a pm
140128,1northerner,2007-12-06 18:00:00,17,  lol  Why not drive up north for a weekend?
140138,DANIMAL,2007-12-06 18:22:00,215,"I have heard of a few guys going out on simcoe on 2-3'' of white/weak ice. But I wouldnt recomend it, lifes worth more than a few perch."
140143,Seaweed,2007-12-06 19:00:00,135,Check Scugog out... you should be able to tell just from looking out from the road that crosses it.  Or other members here might be better informed about the conditions there.  We are out on very thin ice here in Ottawa.. but hey where there is a will there is a way.  Play safe ... don't go alone and bring a rope.
140181,RHYBAK,2007-12-06 20:20:00,21,Scugog is closed right now.
140211,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-06 22:29:00,0,"Some ice on Simcoe isnt that bad. You just have to look walk and chip your way. This is not cooks bay in this picture. It is another part of the lake. I heard there will be huts out here come this weekend on 5"" of good ice. Dont go if you dont know. I dont recommend anyone going out where they are not sure about the ice. I only went as some one looked yesterday...Heres some pics of the ice.    "
