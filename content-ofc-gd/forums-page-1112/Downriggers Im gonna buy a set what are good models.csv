139819,Uncle Buck,2007-12-05 14:31:00,1000, simple but costly... we truely are stupid for paying this much for this stuff.. all the thing does is go up and down... what makes it worth $500+
139825,Fish Farmer,2007-12-05 14:47:00,2234,Metal verses Plastic  . Should I say anymore. I've had big Jons for at least 30 years and there still FISHIN  .
139866,irishfield,2007-12-05 16:52:00,26272," In some regards you have a point Dave... but considering I have 23 years of plastic moulding under my belt I know what to look for. I can mould you a ""plastic"" part that is stronger than steel... in fact we did it for the military night sights on rifles for the US army thru Elcan optical. I question the Scotty covers plastic for longevity..but the Cannons have steel telescopic booms with plastic lock collars and the base is glass reinforced nylon. I don't see it deteriorating in my life time..other than possibly a boom collar cracking."
139870,suds,2007-12-05 17:02:00,70,"Out on the west coast salt chuck you wouldn't even know there were brands other than Scotty. The plastic and stainless combo avoids electrolysis and corrosion better than anything else. Plus the warranty is tremendous. If its only ever going to be freshwater, no issue..  And as others have mentioned, one trip alone with manual riggers, and you will be kicking yourself for not getting electrics!  Cheers suds"
139928,SlowPoke,2007-12-05 21:00:00,2984," Andrea, is that you?"
139930,irishfield,2007-12-05 21:02:00,26272,LOL Brian!
139932,Uncle Buck,2007-12-05 21:16:00,1000, what did i ever do to you Brian   
139933,Gerry,2007-12-05 21:17:00,257,I used to own a pair of manual Canon's and I hated the fact that they were manual. I quit using them shortly thereafter.  My buddy owns a pair of Scotty's and I have to admit they're mighty slick.  I suppose they're all good at doing what they do. Here's me with a catch from L. Ontario last September.....in the background you can see his Scottys'.  
139997,Fisherman,2007-12-06 00:48:00,7201,Scotty's and Wmart probably has the best price.
139219,2 tone z71,2007-12-03 22:28:00,1311,"gonna get a set of elec downriggers this winter /spring whats everybody running ,need some insight"
139223,irishfield,2007-12-03 22:34:00,26272,"I liked my manual Canon unitrolls...so just went with a pair of Canon Mag10 HS units, that Slowpoke was great enough to get me a great price from Angler Outfitters in Woodstock."
139229,misfish,2007-12-03 22:39:00,29133,"If you are handy with electrics,you can buy used manuals (big jon are my preferrence) and turn them into electrics. Princess Auto will have all you need. If you want some help feel free to pm,since Im south of Thunder Bay aswell.LOL"
139231,Fang,2007-12-03 22:40:00,1330,"Cannons get my vote too. I've used Big Jons and Scottys a number of times on friends boats. I bought 2 Mag 10's in 1989 and they are still working great.  There are faster and cheaper ones out there but if I ever have to buy another, I'll spend my money on Cannons  IMO spend the money and get electric"
139246,live2fish,2007-12-03 23:04:00,70,Definitly go with scottys. 1116 or 1117 models are the best. I love mine there super fast up and have auto stop. there free fall down so you can get there in a matter of seconds. Go with scottys you wont regret it.    Bowen
139272,Landlocked,2007-12-04 00:12:00,171,I just bought the Walker auto-stop & weight retreive riggers from Angling Outfitters...first set so can't tell you anything about them but do know you won't find a better price than what they offer.
139282,2 tone z71,2007-12-04 00:59:00,1311,"ive got friends with the Walker units ,they have good things to say about them,I was gonna buy at the sportsman show,but does this place in Woodstock have a website by chance"
139285,fishindevil,2007-12-04 01:13:00,6254,"I think its a matter of personal choice , i have been running 2 big-jons captains packs since 1990,and they are still working great...all the electric middle to top of the line models from all the big 4 companies all work well,and some have a few options that other ones dont have,but figure which ones will suit you best,for example big-jons can go up & down,the boom arm,you can just grab and lift up,its great,and they are all aluminum,never rust,so just see what ones are best for you,and the price,just go to all their websites and do your homework"
139291,sonny,2007-12-04 01:35:00,511,gotta go with the scottys check out their warranty too
139308,HTHM,2007-12-04 03:11:00,4082, I was thinking the same thing... they appear to be electric window crank motors on the inside. Go to the wreckers and buy a old door with electric windows and figure it out. Should be a fun challenge.
139312,irishfield,2007-12-04 03:22:00,26272,"  Pair I inherited with the cottage, found in the boathouse. Either homemade or the original big jons !"
139340,SlowPoke,2007-12-04 10:11:00,2984,"I think they pre-date Big Jon... they may be from the ""getting a little husky Jon"" era."
139342,SlowPoke,2007-12-04 10:21:00,2984,"Come on Bowen! You know better than anyone to pop the rods and let 'em flutter up. Why do you need fast retrieve? By the way, Cannon is faster if you're into retrieve racing. Most riggers have auto-stop, none will stop it in time for the stackers. All have free fall but only Scotty doesn't have power down. And they're flippin' HUGE! I don't have anything against Scotty's, in fact if they were the last downrigger on earth I'd use them in a heartbeat! -Brian"
139345,SlowPoke,2007-12-04 10:34:00,2984,No website Z When you know what you want PM me and I can help get them to you. -Brian

139368,Randy,2007-12-04 12:52:00,115,"I've had Scotty's for over 10 years without a problem except for this year. I have an extending boom out to 4'. The plastic thumb screw that holds the extended boom in place broke off.  Called Scotty and they sent me all the necessary parts and instructions on how to fix it. I could have sent it to them to fix but didn't want to be without. Even though I had this problem, I'd still recommend Scotty."
139370,Blake,2007-12-04 13:09:00,418,I recommend Walkers as they are the ones I use this summer for Erie eries.  The are solid rigeers and come with a lifetime warranty to boot.  Check out there website for more info if you like.
139397,2 tone z71,2007-12-04 14:43:00,1311,Nice thanks for all the help /info  offers pms fellas much appreciated soon as I figure out what I want ill be in touch great site
139469,Tacklebuster,2007-12-04 17:32:00,303,"My electric Big Jons are 30 years old, the only thing ever changed once on both were the electric switches, and the swivel that holds the pully wheel on the arm.  Both were easy and inexpensive to replace.  I know there are nicer ones out there, but if you want ones that will last, then get the Big Jon's and definately get electric (what a pain in the but it must be to real in a fish and the downrigger at the same time when you are by yourself, let alone two riggers when you're fishing salmon on L.O.)"
139474,Smokey,2007-12-04 17:42:00,1278,"I think your going to get as many answers as there are manufacturers. I'm sure they all work well, as they all have there faults. Do some research, find the size your looking for and go with the best deal you can find.  Personally I use Cannons but have no experience with any others to compare."
139503,Uncle Buck,2007-12-04 19:03:00,1000,"i've used a bunch this year, and i like the scotty...  big yes, but i liked them best...  i had 4 walker electrics, now i have 2 electric and 1 manual (all walker)...  big jon - looks like crap, but best rod holders... walker - nice, compact, don't use rod holder for dipsy, don't like the down switch, too easy to flip down instead of stop scotty - huge, i liked them most, don't like that they are all plastic though"
139574,fishdawg,2007-12-04 22:15:00,912,"ive owned a couple different ones & used many on other buddies boats  They are all quite comparable like others said, but they allhave a couple different things about them  Big Jons do have the best rod holders & they tilt back, also the electrics can be manuals as well (come with a handle unlike the other brands) Scottys also are great  - but are a little big, are plastic & rod holders cant really be adjusted Walkers - Canadian made, good warranty, lousy rod holders Cannons - solid, good holders, small footprint,  When I upgrade my boat years from now  Big Jons or Cannons will be going on it"
139646,danc,2007-12-05 00:13:00,4677,It seems that down riggers are a lot like digital cameras. Everyone loves the model and brand that they bought. Which is a good thing. Sometimes you just can't go wrong.
139649,irishfield,2007-12-05 00:34:00,26272,"Yep... just like GM, Chrylser or Ford Dan. Everyone has a favourite. There is something about the Cannons though...that make them look like they belong on a boat. Some just look weird! They all do the same thing... lower a heavy ball to the depths.  "
139684,danc,2007-12-05 01:40:00,4677, Yup. Pretty simple concept Wayne when you think about it.
