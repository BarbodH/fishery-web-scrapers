139941,Gerritt,2007-12-05 22:13:00,6129,Well.... I was just informed by my wife that I need my old float suit cleaned.... I guess some moose steaks fell out of the freezer (Grrrrrrrrrr!) and landed on the floor... she did not notice it till today as my float suit concealed it...(I had it draped over a tote to dry it out)  So the arm is soaked in moose blood...  How do you guys clean your suits?  I have a new suit on the way to replace this one... (it is getting tight on me) but I would still like to have it cleaned so the person I give it to at a later date does not have to deal with it...  just warm water and some ivory soap in the sink?  Drycleaner?  Just throw it in the washer??  Thanks in advance guys..  Gerritt.
139944,Sandbag,2007-12-05 22:16:00,533,I would soak it in water for a day or so to loosen the blood up a bit.  I would then just throw it in the washing machine all by itself and hang to dry.  Cheers  Sandbag
139945,irishfield,2007-12-05 22:19:00,26272,DO NOT Dryclean.  Mustang's website has a section on cleaning Gerritt.

139966,snackpack5150,2007-12-05 23:56:00,79,Do not dry clean it unless you want to buy a new one.  Tide in a bucket and scrub brush will do the trick and good rinse.

139972,JohnF,2007-12-06 00:09:00,3494," You said carwash, not cathouse.  JF"
139978,FinS,2007-12-06 00:21:00,463,soak it in cold water mixed with dd7 for a day

140031,bobkayla,2007-12-06 06:06:00,148,"clean it? i enjoy the fish slime on mine ,,i""ve been smelling it with all this bad weather!!"
140047,cranks bait,2007-12-06 13:18:00,721,"I washed mine in a triple loader washer with Nikwax Tech wash and cold water.  It's a non detergent soap to clean manmade fabrics.  I then did another cycle with their TX Direct wash in to help water proof it.  Put it in the dryer for about 5 minutes on low heat then hang dry.  After a day flip it inside out to get the other side dry. This is how I clean all my climbing gear that I have had for 10 years, and still looks new."
140048,BITEME,2007-12-06 13:21:00,1969,WARM WATER AND MILD SOAP >>>>PERIOD HANG DRY
140051,Rich,2007-12-06 13:44:00,3927,Don't clean it! You'll wash off all the character!
140052,irishfield,2007-12-06 13:45:00,26272,Oh with Gerritt... there's enough Character inside !
140061,Beans,2007-12-06 14:43:00,3339,How about a tin of lighter fluid and a match...  take Gerritt out of it first
140113,crappieperchhunter,2007-12-06 17:25:00,2582,"CLEAN A FLOATER SUIT ????? Did I accidentally click onto the Chataleine website??? LOL. If I cleaned mine it would probably fall apart. Besides, I like the way it stands up all by itself in the corner of the basement. Like a soldier...waiting for battle!!!"
