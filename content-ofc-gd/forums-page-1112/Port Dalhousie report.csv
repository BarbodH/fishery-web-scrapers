Water temp. was 39-40 F. and the air temp stayed well below freezing all day, had to lather the electric motor up with fish scent to keep it from freezing. Cought a couple nice steelhead and my brother cought a small (12-13"") coho up near the rapids. Got sick of the crowds up there so we tried pulling kwickfish and spinner rigs down closer to the lake. cought 1 more nice steelhead and missed another, both on the spinner rig.  Heres a couple of pics.   "
