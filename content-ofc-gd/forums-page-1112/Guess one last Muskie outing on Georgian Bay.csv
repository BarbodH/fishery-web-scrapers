139880,irishfield,2007-12-05 17:26:00,26272,"I was still hoping to get out one last time on the Bay. Even scouted the local launch a few times over the last few days figuring worst case I take my plow truck down and clean it out myself...but with low winds last night, this happened ... so I guess I'm SOL."
139882,bucktail,2007-12-05 17:27:00,1857,Just bring the 12 inch auger!
139887,lew,2007-12-05 17:34:00,12767,"Wayne, that water appears slightly stiffer than when I was there with you a few weeks ago"
139888,Raf,2007-12-05 17:35:00,3495,"wayne, we tried this past wknd too but the foot of snow overnight and -10 temps made us make the wise choice of wrapping the boat up for winter.  with all this cold, we'll likely be out somewhere drilling holes before them month is out."
139889,BITEME,2007-12-05 17:36:00,1969,Come on with that bid icebreaker you got    shouldnt be a problem
139891,Tybo,2007-12-05 17:38:00,1373,What. You worry about putting some character marks on the new Lund.  The boat should cut through that like a knife.
139892,ccmtcanada,2007-12-05 17:39:00,7971,Bly and I tried one of our fav shore spots last night.  I scouted it late afternoon and it was fine.  By the time we got there at 8pm a skim had formed and an hour later it was unfishable. I did have a nice tussle with a big chunk of ice.  My lure came off after about 5 minutes.  Too bad...it would have been a PB for me...LOL.
139893,Headhunter,2007-12-05 17:40:00,5703,That's what I'm hoping NOT TO SEE on Thursday at the Q! At least your tried Wayne! HH
139896,Terry,2007-12-05 17:45:00,14456,air boat with the 5hp honda to troll with and your good to go
139899,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-05 18:12:00,0,well........... if it would make you feel any better. Im going ICE FISHING up that way this weekend. Not on Georgian Bay though.  There should be good  ice fishing come Christmas for sure. Its good to see it looking like it used to be way back when we had a winter...lol  You could always launch on the other side or Thunder Bay beach.......
139903,AzuluSpookd,2007-12-05 18:28:00,348,One of those falls where I thought....and I stress thought....I would be fishing out on GB til early mid december....  I'll start winterizing my boat today  GB....I'll check the ice out tommorow and let you know  There's always next year.....and the year after...and after.....We'll have to get out for a fish or two Irishfield.
139905,keram,2007-12-05 18:45:00,585,"The water looks pretty ""calm"" in your pictures, so I do not know what is a problem"
139910,Whopper,2007-12-05 19:11:00,2174,Wayne it seems to me that a certain someone said Call his bluff
139916,misfish,2007-12-05 20:14:00,29133,"Thats a BEAUTIFUL sight.Bring it on. Terry,dont forget the bent screwdriver."
139919,irishfield,2007-12-05 20:31:00,26272,"Oh well I can't complain..was in the water before most stuff opened in May, spent from then 'till pretty much now on the water on a very regular bases... so I guess if my only penalty is to lose a week and a half of Muskie season so be it. Let her freeze so I can get to my Island up North for winter frolics!"
139923,Kerry,2007-12-05 20:51:00,383,"Wayne, On the way back from working in Midland yesterday I coulda' swore I saw the huts out from Hogg's Bay already.I can't wait to get out on some hard water seeing as the boat went into the back yard last weekend. Good thing is we already have some early snowmobile trails opening up towards Haliburton and east so at least the sledding season is coming online quicker this year.  Kerry"
139925,irishfield,2007-12-05 20:56:00,26272,Wouldn't doubt the huts on Hogg's. Bay Port marina and shoreline around the Midland Town docks were all frozen the other day. The main bay etc was staying open (as late as last night) though thanks to the wind. Was hoping it would stay open for the + degrees we are supposed to get tomorrow and Saturday and the ice in the channel by the ramp would have been breakable with the boat..as there's a fair current in there. Oh well..life goes on..and with the happenings of today I can't go fishing tomorrow anyhow..in for some minor surgery instead in the am (nothing serious!).
140530,irishfield,2007-12-07 22:31:00,26272,Well I officially gave in today. Open water is over for the season I guess. Still gotta go thru the boat and get my stuff out of it...but she's blocked up off her tires and ready for a 5 month rest.

140536,Greencoachdog,2007-12-07 22:48:00,8163,I see there's a nice warming trend heading y'alls way...                ... about sometime in June.
