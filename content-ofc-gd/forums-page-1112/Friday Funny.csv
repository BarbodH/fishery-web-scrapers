So one day he decides to sit down and write a letter to God.  Dear God, please send me $100.00 so that i can buy christmas presents for my family,,,,,.  He signed the letter ,sealed it in an envelope and wrote on the outside TO GOD,,, Canada When the letter made it to the postal office the workers looked at it and decided to send it on to Ottawa and addressed it to the Prime Minister, a few days later the PM opens and reads the letter and starts to chuckle and is amused by it, so he decides to send back $10.00, as he thinks a small boy will think thats a lot of money. Eventually the boy gets his letter back and opens it to find $10.00, he was so happy he sits down to write a letter back to God:  Dear God  Thanks so much for the money, but I noticed by the post mark on the envelope that for some reason you mailed it through Ottawa, and those idiots deducted $90.00 in taxes !!!!!"
