139865,Canuck2fan,2007-12-05 16:44:00,1444,"OH OH I was out of money with 5 hands to go but I got 76% correct.... That is the kind of teaching I don't need, I can usually lose money real good by myself LOL."
140077,ScarSnake,2007-12-06 15:33:00,20,"Made 100% correct decisions, and lost $23.  Even at 100% perfect basic strategy, the house still has a 1-2% advantage. How and when you bet is what will make you some $$$ at the table.  No disrespect, but playing at 76% is guaranteed to make you go broke in a hurry. You can buy little credit card size charts that will show you the basic strategy. They normally don't mind if you bring one to the table, and often the dealer will even let you know when you're making a mistake. Like splitting tens, when they call it out loud to the pit boss!"

I was the quiet one...loved it when the older brother would come home...he hated losing...it meant that I would be getting myself some new threads when he left."
