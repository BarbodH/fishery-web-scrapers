Yesterday she took a turn for the worse and she passed this morning about 6:30.  Her life was long and fulfilling and although I'll miss her I know she has gone to a better place and a place without pain.  I haven't posted this picture in a while but it's one of my favorites taken on the Montreal River by Elk Cabins when she was in her 80's.  I think it captured her spirit well.  "
