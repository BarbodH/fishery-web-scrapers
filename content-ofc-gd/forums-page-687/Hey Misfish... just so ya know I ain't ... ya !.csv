464147,nofish4me,2010-05-07 23:06:00,404,"All I seen was, a $375 bill for a preliminary visit from TSSA (pay attention to the word preliminary). Hahaha Oh ya and the turkeys."
464150,misfish,2010-05-07 23:13:00,29133,"I,ll be sure to pass the word on to misfish.He,s a close and personal friend ya know.  If truth be told,I am one of those that was against the lenghtening of the hunting hours,and still am,or I would be out there after work.I like the 1/2 hour before, til noon still.The birds may be coming on strong,but way to early to be lengthing the hunt hours on them.IMO.   Thanks for the pic/tease Wayne."
464151,irishfield,2010-05-07 23:13:00,26272,Diesel tank belongs to the local supplier.. for the FARM tractor ! ;O)  TSSA has been going overboard lately... even forced Lakeland Airways to tear down their hangar because the houseboat fuel tank was too close to structure. (only been that way for 30+ years!)
464167,nofish4me,2010-05-08 00:04:00,404," Change suppliers, and then see how fast TSSA shows up. What a surprise! Guess who called them. Original supplier left the old tanks behind (no use for them). New tanks now and all is good,both gas and diesel. Hahaha Oh ya, I told them to give the bill to whom ever called them. Never saw another bill, but saw them a few times after."
464178,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-08 01:04:00,0,  As someone said...You gotta get yerself a gun and just show the end result hangin in the tree or from the tractor. I'll take any deer ya have after if ya don't let Marty shoot it that is...   Im kidding..
464222,Chuck Best,2010-05-08 08:20:00,308,"They're putting weeping tile on the farm I hunt and I ain't seen a bird all week,even the deer took off.......SSSooo,If you need a hand or Bri,If you need a travelling companion,I'm in....and now I'm off to sit in the rain again...lol...TC...Chuck..."
464306,misfish,2010-05-08 15:30:00,29133,"Back from sitting in the rain for 5 hours.Had two goobles reply to my clucks but nethier of them came out to play.I hate sitting in the rain. Wayne,is your area open for gun hunting on Sundays? I cant tell by the map?  Chuck anytime.Just email or pm me."
464312,irishfield,2010-05-08 15:35:00,26272, I always thought it was... considering the locals all seem to do it !! BUT Marty seems to have determined that it isn't since we are amalgamated into the town of Penetang. We use to be Tay twsp.
464314,misfish,2010-05-08 15:37:00,29133,  They know the fast routes out.
464321,AzuluSpookd,2010-05-08 16:15:00,348,"No go for Sundays Brian.  If you have any properties in Tay township to go to, your good to go.   And GB...  ...."
464325,irishfield,2010-05-08 16:27:00,26272,"I'd actually make the call to Midhurst or Rick or one of the other CO's. We were TAY for ever out here (why it's called Tay Point Rd!) until amalgamation... and I think they may still consider this (everything East of Fuller Ave) open on Sundays. Like I said, all the locals still do it!"
464340,wuchikubo,2010-05-08 17:42:00,1114, Is it open for crossbow hunting on Sundays?
464438,AzuluSpookd,2010-05-08 23:17:00,348,"Yup, just no guns.  Wayne, I spoke to your little buddy who doesn't like folks with conservation licenses fishing for skis, and he did advise that you're not tay. He said to use the map, it is exact and you're not in it.  Remember...zosche's follow no rules "
464446,irishfield,2010-05-08 23:31:00,26272,..or seasons..
464448,misfish,2010-05-08 23:36:00,29133, I thought my approch was much more polite Marty.
464466,AzuluSpookd,2010-05-08 23:59:00,348,You are correct...East coasters are always polite.....Ma is from Cape Breton...I'm not...which would explain things
