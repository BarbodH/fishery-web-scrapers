I stopped in today on my way home just for a quick look and he seems to have a fair bit of stock and the sign says he sells worms too, but other than that I didn't even have time to check his prices.  Appears to be a nice little place but seems to have strange hours. It looks like he's only open Friday, Saturday & Sunday from 9:00 AM till about 6 or 7  Anyways, just thought I'd pass it on as an FYI"
