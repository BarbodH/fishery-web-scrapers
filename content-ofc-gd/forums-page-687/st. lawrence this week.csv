464588,cranks bait,2010-05-09 13:52:00,721,Keep in mind the water is a bit lower than usual.  Rocks that you can usually glide over are now exposed or just beneath the surface.  I've been hearing of some good fish coming out of the river.  I haven't had a chance to get out yet though.  Biggest tip I can give you.....HAVE FUN!!!!!
