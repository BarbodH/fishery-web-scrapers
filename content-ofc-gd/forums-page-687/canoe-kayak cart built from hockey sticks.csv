Step #2: Collect a few broken hockey sticks. I used 3 graphite and 1 wooden stick and copied the paddleboy design as it works well with the unusual hull design of my Ultimate kayak.  Step #3: I used less than $5 worth of hardware to put it all together so total cost was under $20.   I installed the wheels on the inside of the cart frame to keep a slimmer profile when the cart is on the back of the yak. This is how it will look on the water.  I still have to add some pool noodle pieces to the contact points, to prevent scratching, and a bungee cord to hold it in place."
