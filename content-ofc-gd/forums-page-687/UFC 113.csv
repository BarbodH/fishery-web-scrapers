464516,Terry,2010-05-09 03:04:00,14456,I think it's so you can see his tats    I see the streaming vid on the computer is 40 seconds behind the live show on the tv
464517,Gerritt,2010-05-09 03:08:00,6129,better then nothing LOL
464518,Twocoda,2010-05-09 03:09:00,4130,gotta give the first round to stevens
464523,Gerritt,2010-05-09 03:53:00,6129,Koschek = loser!... that was pathetic
464524,Gerritt,2010-05-09 04:09:00,6129,I dont think we will see Daley in the UFC again.. Dana must be pissed!
464525,Twocoda,2010-05-09 04:14:00,4130,Both koscheck and Daily are pathetic....  time for the main event!!!!!!!!!
464526,Jigger,2010-05-09 04:16:00,1237,Koscheck faked the first round knee and then played blanket the last two rounds. I really dislike him and GSP wont like him too much either after they coach against each other. What a tool. WAR MACHIDA!
464528,Twocoda,2010-05-09 04:27:00,4130,WOW that was quick
464529,Jigger,2010-05-09 04:30:00,1237,Guess that sets up a third? Great job Shogun!
464532,Gerritt,2010-05-09 05:09:00,6129,watching the pres conference... Dana Says Daley is out of the UFC. Finished.
464568,Terry,2010-05-09 11:57:00,14456,Daleysucks    some good fights  lets hear it for shogun
464572,Cudz,2010-05-09 12:27:00,2652,"Not bad on your picks Steve.  I picked well and only missed Mcdonald, and Doerksen.  Great card.  Makes up for 112. Kos is a crappy actor but Daley is a dirtbag and got what he deserved.  He needs to learn some professionalism."
464379,Twocoda,2010-05-08 19:55:00,4130,Heres my picks  Machita Koscheck Stout Slice Cote Lawlor MacDonald  hopefully the rest of the bouts will be entertaining ...GO Stout GO!!! represent London Ontario well!!!!!
464382,Terry,2010-05-08 20:02:00,14456,can't wait to see Machida vs Shogun should be a great rematch    
464386,walleyejigger,2010-05-08 20:08:00,876,Machida (one of my favorites) Koschek Stephens Kimbo (but i'd like to see him get knocked out) Cote Lawlor ( i think this may put an end to Doerksen career) Macdonald (you gotta go wit the good ol' canadian boys) Davis (just cause i always thought he had one of the greatest nicknames)
464389,Twocoda,2010-05-08 20:13:00,4130,walleye - i agree about Kimbo....but ya never know ...he has been stepping up his game but i honestly dont think he has the cardio  MacDonald is a tough dude he can take punishment
464398,misfish,2010-05-08 21:01:00,29133," Yep, except for Kimbo.Just dont see it.Has not proven he can take a fight,,,,,,,,in the octagon.  Machita needs to take it earlly or it will be a repeat. IMO"
