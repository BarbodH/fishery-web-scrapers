464061,muskymatt,2010-05-07 18:29:00,2608,"I've been making baits for a few years now and have through trail and error improved on some techniques and feel I have it pretty good now.  Here is a step by step on how I get to the finished product, only thing lacking is the painted picture which I will have within the next couple days.  I also paint all my own baits and have gotten pretty decent with my air brush.  It's amazing how quickly baits can go together...and lots of fun too.  Let me know what you think..  The materials    Tracing the template ready to cut out    Ready to install the thru wire    Thru wire cut and hole drilled for lead    Wire bent and ready to glue    Clamp    Glued    Cut out lexan bills and sand to perfection ready to install    The lead pot, pour into holes      Ready to paint    Stay tuned for some pretty sweet paint pics after I give them 3 coats of primer...."
464064,Paully,2010-05-07 18:37:00,712,looking good so far.. lots of work goes into them eh?
464065,anders,2010-05-07 18:40:00,1168,very impressive...looking forward to seeing the finished products
464070,Terry,2010-05-07 19:04:00,14456,they look great
464095,Twocoda,2010-05-07 20:32:00,4130,"in the words of Freddy Prince....""LOOOOOOKEEEEENG GOOOOOD!"""
464098,muskymatt,2010-05-07 20:52:00,2608," Not too bad actually, I figure from start until ready for paint is about 25 min per bait not including glue drying time which is about 2 hrs.  I make them in batches of 6 and can have 6 ready for glueing in about 1.5 hrs.  Glueing and shaping takes a while but not bad.  Painting can take up to 25 min per bait and then coating with nuluster will take 20 min each time, 3 times over 3 days."

464184,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-08 01:20:00,3761,looks sexy indeed. What's the length on these baits?
464196,muskymatt,2010-05-08 02:13:00,2608," average 6""-6.5"" and a bit.  should have a finished product by Mon-Tues.."
464245,muskymatt,2010-05-08 12:13:00,2608,Here's another one ...a little less weight added and a bigger bill will give it a different action.      Almost time to clean the shop and get the airbrush out...
464417,kyle7273,2010-05-08 21:48:00,65,Looks like a fun project to try with the kids. Imagine how excited they would be to catch a fish on a bait they made themselves.
464552,archer379,2010-05-09 10:14:00,277,great work! that looks like a nice winter hobbie i may give it a try myself
