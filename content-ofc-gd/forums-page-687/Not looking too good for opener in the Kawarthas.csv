464545,fish-miester,2010-05-09 07:41:00,864,archer I agree ! I totaly forgot my sign when i caught this one today

464555,Big Cliff,2010-05-09 10:26:00,6899,"Looked out the window a few times yesterday and watched the rain and snow squalls coming across the lake and guys out there in boats. There is no way in this world I want to catch a fish that badly.  I was hoping I could get out today but woke up this morning, Temp. 0Â°C, winds climbing to 30K, looks and feels like mid Nov. out there!"
464557,ketchenany,2010-05-09 10:37:00,3229,"Same here Cliff, just looked out and light snow on cars and the furnace is going!"
464558,mr blizzard,2010-05-09 10:40:00,1589,
464559,purekgw,2010-05-09 10:45:00,585,Can tell you right now sturgeon isn't calm damn wind
464772,Sinker,2010-05-10 03:35:00,8692,"I adapted and fished a smaller, out of the way lake instead of the bigger kawartha lakes. Spent 8 hours out in the rain/hail/sleet/snow/wind and caught my 4 walleye. I had to use bait to get them, but they tasted just the same  I released one under the slot, and caught an OOS musky about 32"" as well!!  I'll be the first to admit, it sucked out there, and I was wet and cold by the time I came off the water. I shoulda wore my floater suit.......BRRRRRRRRRRR!!! It stopped raining for about 15 mins the whole time I was out. It was worth it though  S."
463908,Big Cliff,2010-05-07 09:46:00,6899,"Cold front + thunder showers/rain + 30K winds out of the NW = not a very good opening weekend for our our area.  I've been watching the forecast all week, my kids were going to come down to spend the weekend fishing with me but we decided to hold off until next weekend (that is better anyway, we'll get an extra day out of it  )  We have some friends coming from Goderich for the weekend but he doesn't care if we get out fishing or not so we may just spend some time getting fat and playing some cards. Oh well there are worse things in life LOL."
463914,scugpg,2010-05-07 10:42:00,1373,"I hear ya Cliff, same down this way   Next time I'm up there I'll give you a shout."
463915,fishindevil,2010-05-07 10:51:00,6254,"yes we know how sturgeon lake will be for sure cliff,it figures last year it was even worse it was snowing and blowing it was miserable....oh well the walleye just might get an extra few days to fattin up !!!!  lol we will probly go out but will stay on the ready or maybe hit a smaller lake with a little more weather protection.maybe ernie and i will see you out there in the comming days...do you know if snug harbor has the gas pumps up and running yet???? birch point has been the only place to get gas on the lake so far this year....shawn"
463916,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-07 10:52:00,2690,"Agreed, was going to give Scugog a shot tomorrow for opener...co-worker was going in his boat as well, but, the winds and cold front are more than likely going to postpone the visit. Looks like cards for me as well."
463926,bigugli,2010-05-07 11:23:00,6138,"Despite the forecast, the son insists we baptise his boat tomorrow. Time for the Mustang suit and a thermos of something hot."
463935,John,2010-05-07 11:52:00,2956,Playing cards and gettin' fat ain't so bad Cliff when you have a view like that....Have a great weekend and give Sue a hug and kiss for me for Mom's day...they will still be there next weekend.
463949,JohnF,2010-05-07 13:18:00,3494, Bah! Sailors!  JF
463996,fish-miester,2010-05-07 15:04:00,864,I think I may go try my luck tomorrow depending on what it looks like out there
464001,Sinker,2010-05-07 15:09:00,8692," Hey Shaun, no pumps at snug. They're gone for good.  Wind sucks. I've been battling it all week. It sucks when you get crap weather on your annual week off, but ya just make the best of it!  S."

464008,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-07 15:22:00,2690,"Don't blame you...that's the advantage you have being in Lindsay, Could be tough fishing with the double whammy cold fronts, but, it IS opener.  Good luck!!!"
464046,Mykester,2010-05-07 17:05:00,241,  VD weekend is in 2 weeks actually.
464060,fish-miester,2010-05-07 18:28:00,864," haha I always keep a pair of snow pants, winter gloves, and an extra sweater in the boat until I know its going to be nice out just in case! with the cold front and all.. I may just have to start off wearing them hah"

464075,jimmer,2010-05-07 19:17:00,2730,"Come on Cliff,  maybe the weather will change or hold off if we all pray to the fish gods! LOL I'm going no matter what, at least until I can't hold the rod any longer."
464097,Sinker,2010-05-07 20:51:00,8692," I'm praying!!  I'm gonna giver, screw it. I have rain gear, and a float suit if I need it. I'm sure the fishing will be tough, but its tradition EH! The boat is already hooked up  S."
464103,buckster,2010-05-07 21:07:00,530, I wouldn't expect any less from you! lol
