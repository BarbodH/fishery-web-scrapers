Last year was crazy with lousy weather and both good and bad excuses all coming together to limit me to just a few times out but I'm hoping to make up for it this year.  To that end I was lucky enough to hook up with Lexxington for a trip to Quinte for the opener last weekend.  We met in Pickering at the perfect time of 3:45 and by 6:30 we were launching the boat into Hay Bay.  <a href=""   title=""Morning on Hay bay by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4571102481_5afdd23762_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Morning on Hay bay"" /></a>  It wasn't too long until we had our first fish in the boat and my first soft water fish of the year  <a href=""   title=""Pike were everyhwere by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4571101265_6b024c65fb_o.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Pike were everyhwere"" /></a>  Not exactly what we were looking for but it's a fish right?  I then proceeded to land a couple more pike before I hooked into something with some weight to it that was just pulling down.  Could I have the magical quinte walleye?  Lex was getting a bit upset since I was already up 3 on him but he cheered up when this came to the surface  <a href=""   title=""Baaah!! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4571734958_ab2a79c12f_o.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Baaah!!"" /></a>  Woohoo, my first ever Sheepie!!!  And a big one too boot .  This got a few good chuckles from the nearby boaters (boy was the bay ever busy)  Soon after Lexx got into the fish but of course he managed to get the target.  Nothing big but dinner was in the livewell  <a href=""   title=""Pauls Dinner by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/4571105567_b57fa9576c_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Pauls Dinner"" /></a>  I got a couple big ones too  <a href=""   title=""They're big up close by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4571735120_fe0af9ffba_o.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""They're big up close"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Give him a few years by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4571732670_c0cb47047c_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Give him a few years"" /></a>  And Lexx finally figured out the pike.  Boy does he look happy  <a href=""   title=""Not what we wanted by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4571735180_7cd81ae78c_o.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Not what we wanted"" /></a>  Later in the afternoon (3ish) the skies got really nasty and we started talking about pulling out but went for one more drift.  At this point Lexx had 3 keepers in the well and I'd managed pike, sheepshead, perch and a couple OOS largies but no walleye so was I ever happy when I got a sharp pop on the spinner on the last drift:  <a href=""   title=""Hello dinner! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3523/4571733644_af63a878a8_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Hello dinner!"" /></a>  Then skies really opened up and we pulled out.  By the time we got the boat out and tied down (line up at the launch) the skies had cleared a bit but we checked the marine forecast, accuweather and weather network and they all called for thunderstorms all day Sunday.  We hummed and hahhed while trying to dry off and then we did it - we wimped out and went back to TO rather than paying $$ for the hotel we'd booked and risk wasting out time.  Of course Sunday turned out to be just fine - damn you mother nature but at least I meant I got to have a nice snack Saturday night.  Nothing like frying up the fish you caught a few hours earlier:   <a href=""   title=""First fresh fry of the year by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4571101179_d6c44bbe8a_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""First fresh fry of the year"" /></a>   Even though we skipped a day it was still a great opener.  We never went long without some action and the weather until we pulled up was perfect.  All in all I'm happy to have started off the season and now I can't wait to get back out again.  I've almost convinced the fiancee to give rice lake walleye a try but then she went and booked a meeting with a photographer on the weekend - she just doesn't understand  Anhyhow, nice to be back all.  Hopefully I'll be able to post some more soon.  TbayBoy"

463520,limeyangler,2010-05-06 13:50:00,5204,"Good to see ya out and about TBB, that sheepshead looks ok fried"
463525,superdad,2010-05-06 14:08:00,353,Good report for your weekend. I see you were in Hay Bay as I could see my boat on the dock behind you in the third picture. There were a ton of boats fishing off that point. We got our fish in a little deeper water.  Cheers
463546,irishfield,2010-05-06 14:57:00,26272,"Great stuff Guys! That's one big Terryfish and Paul.. smile for God sakes, you're out fishing!!!!"

463622,Leecher,2010-05-06 17:43:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Shaun I was kind of wondering what was happening with you.... welcome back dude You guys got into a good mix bag!!! congrats Thanks for sharing your opener with us. Looking forward to your future reports!!! Leechman"
463725,Stoty,2010-05-06 22:04:00,2910,"Right on, good report!  We had a pretty good weekend. I had the 4th place fish (just over 10 lbs), but it didnt make it, so it was DQ'ed We managed to land 35 walleye the first day, and 15 on Sunday. Not much with much size, A LOT of 12-15 inchers. Which is a good sign for the years to come though! Beside the 10lb'er, we only had one around 5.5 lbs and a few in the 2-4lb range.  We were marking TONS of fish, but they didnt seem to be to active.  All in all, it was a great weekend."
464082,LeXXington,2010-05-07 20:06:00,1928,LOL.. ok I was a little upset with a pike taking my nice walleye bait..  That was the largest sheepshead I have ever seen taken on my boat.. and boy I was glad to see it leave. .  Always a pleasure TbayBoy now if the weather would co-operate so I could get out again!!
464110,irishfield,2010-05-07 21:28:00,26272,I'd seen that face of yours in that mood before Paul... I think it was on a ramp...    And I think that Tbayboy had something to do with that tooo didn't he....
464137,LeXXington,2010-05-07 22:38:00,1928,Ramp .. I have no idea what your talking about..  Let me lower my windows so I can hear you better
464138,irishfield,2010-05-07 22:39:00,26272,
464268,tbayboy,2010-05-08 13:57:00,1497,Yeah there was no shortage of traffice off that point but the graph was lit up quite nicely so can't blame anyone for hanging around there.  And the coffee is spit on the keyboard - thanks for reminding me of that one
