I checked the Humminbird site and you need to order a whole kit with hardware and parts that I don't require, but of course, have to pay for, just to get the suction cup.  Also, I'm sure there will be shipping charges, which I'd just as soon avoid. - This particular suction cup has a tapped hole which accomadates a bolt which holds the transducer, so it's not like any suction cup will do, although if I could look at a few, I might find one that I can work with.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could lay my hands on a suitable replacement?  Who sells suction cups?  Anyone go through this before? - Thanks."

I screwed the transducer onto a piece of hockey stick and clamp it on the side of the canoe with a C clamp.  It works great.  If you use your imagination maybe you can come up with something."
