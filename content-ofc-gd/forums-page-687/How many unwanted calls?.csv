464210,Mykester,2010-05-08 03:12:00,241,"Yes, it's annoying. I usually call them back since a lot have a 905 area code, but they always act surprised."

464247,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-08 12:24:00,0,I have no concern about the home phone calls. I know how to deal with them. It's the cell phone charges each month. I guess it all depends on what service you have. When you're out fishing you only expect to receive calls from people you know as your number is new and no one else should have it. It makes ya wonder. I wonder how much the solicitors paid for the numbers and think maybe we should be the ones getting reimbursed...
