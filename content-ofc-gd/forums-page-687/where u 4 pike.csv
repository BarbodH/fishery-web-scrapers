The year before we cought numbers but just smallies. That same year late season i got a 4 and a 5 pounder in 2 casts. Now i do not kid u when i say this lake use to be my favourite lake ever i use to be able to boat 45 fish easy all catch and release from pike bass muskie, now it seems the lake is dead. Does any one know anything? Ka but to my question i fish pike once a year so does anyone have a good pike lake they would like to share 4 the day. thanks OFC community shaun white 007"
