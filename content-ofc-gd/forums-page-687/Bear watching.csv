464088,greenfshrmn,2010-05-07 20:16:00,65,"Hi folks, after viewing TJ's post about the bears (By the way, what a good looking family he has there) I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions of where to go to actually watch some bears (other than the zoo!)  I had one cross the road infront of me in Haliburton last summer and that was the first one I'd seen in the wild.  I have no interest in hunting.  (Heck, at my age I even feel guilty when a fish takes a hook too deeply and I can't release it) I'm just interested in having the opportunity to view a black bear again and maybe take a few photographs.  I live in the Durham region and have no problem driving north within reason.  People say they are attracted to garbage sites at night but I have no idea where to go.  Any suggestions?"

464102,lew,2010-05-07 21:05:00,12766,Neighbor had a black bear in his backyard just down the road from me last night. Musta been looking to snack on the turkeys he had on his front lawn in the morning.

464123,Pigeontroller,2010-05-07 21:56:00,2793,"South (5 minutes)of Kinmount on hwy 121, turn left(east) on Crystal Lake road, go about 8 Kms you'll see the Dump on your left. Sunday nights the Dump Lady lets you park and watch the Bears."
464143,bigugli,2010-05-07 22:54:00,6138,That or the Minden town dump off 35
464148,Billy Bob,2010-05-07 23:06:00,5865,"Every time hear ""bear watching"" I think of ""The Great Outdoors"" with Canadian Super Star ""John Candy""... he was my FAVORITE actor...God Bless Him.  Now get yourself some candy bars and put them under the windshield wipers...  :D"
464149,Dara,2010-05-07 23:07:00,3052,We had 4 in town here today.  st Christophers elementary school playground is a good spot
464183,Mattones,2010-05-08 01:16:00,587,If you know someone who is baiting Bears for hunting season just ask if you can sit in a treestand and watch them pig out
464188,Ron,2010-05-08 01:30:00,1683,Whitney Drive In. aka Whitney township garbage disposal.  (Actually I photoshoped the garbage into the background so the hunters couldn't ID this location ) 
464348,greenfshrmn,2010-05-08 18:27:00,65,"Thanks for all the suggestions.  Soldiers Field is a little too far, those bears are hibernating til the fall, anyways.  Kinmount sounds good, although I'm not too sure about the Dump Lady, she sounds scarey.  I'll let you know if I have any luck."
464363,kyle7273,2010-05-08 19:18:00,65,"Our family likes to camp up in Tobermory quite often. There are always lots of bears around there, especially at night."
464371,ehg,2010-05-08 19:38:00,2666,The parents took us to the dump off Crystal Lake Rd. 30 yrs. ago when were in the area. Probably the best and closest spot to surely see a black bear.
464374,Mykester,2010-05-08 19:41:00,241,About 8 years ago we saw a black bear at Killbear Provincial Park. I also saw one last year running across Highway 144.
