464323,blarg,2010-05-08 16:22:00,289,"In the few years i have been here the weather pattern seems to be a nice week or two in march/april and the the weather turns to crap until about july. love the bay..o and last year the weather was bad until august, i had most of july off and it rained all but 3 days."
464504,Rizzo,2010-05-09 02:51:00,4754, bingo. i think last summer the best weather we had was in April and then the last few weeks in August. here's hoping we don't have a repeat of that.
