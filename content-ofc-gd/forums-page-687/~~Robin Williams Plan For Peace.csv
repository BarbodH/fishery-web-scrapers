464048,oldphart,2010-05-07 17:17:00,665,"~~~You gotta love Robin Williams........Even if he's nuts! Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan. What we need now is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message. Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic!)  'I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for peace. So, here's one plan.'  1) 'The US, UK , CANADA and  AUSTRALIA  will apologize to the world for our 'interference' in their affairs, past & present. You know, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Tojo, Noriega, Milosevic, Hussein, and the rest of those 'good 'ole' boys', we will never 'interfere' again.  2) We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting withGermany,  South Korea , the Middle East, and the  Philippines . They don't want us there. We would station troops at our borders. No one allowed sneaking through holes in the fence.  3) All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave. We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered up and deported immediately, regardless of whom or where they are from. They're illegal!!!  France  will welcome them.  4) All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90 days unless given a special permit!!!! No one from a terrorist nation will be allowed in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself and don't hide here. Asylum would never be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers or 7-11 cashiers.  5) No foreign 'students' over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a 'D' and it's back home baby.     6) The US, UK , CANADA and  AUSTRALIA  will make a strong effort to become self-sufficient energy wise. This will include developing nonpolluting sources of energy but will require a temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to cope for a while.   7) Offer  Saudi Arabia  and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it, we go someplace else. They can go somewhere else to sell their production. (About a week of the wells filling up the storage sites would be enough.)   8) If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not 'interfere.' They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or whatever they need. Besides most of what we give them is stolen or given to the army. The people who need it most get very little, if anything.  9) Ship the UN  Headquarters to an isolated island someplace. We don't need the spies and fair weather friends here. Besides, the building would make a good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens..  10) All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call us 'Ugly Americans' any longer. The Language we speak is ENGLISH...learn it...or LEAVE. Now, isn't that a winner of a plan? 'The Statue of  Liberty  is no longer saying 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.' She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, 'you want a piece of me?' '"
464051,Mykester,2010-05-07 17:25:00,241,Reminds me of last night's episode of the Daily Show.
464052,Terry,2010-05-07 17:26:00,14456,"well if truth be known   this is the only part of that, that Williams wrote is   ""The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.' She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, 'You want a piece of me?'"" - Robin Williams.   all the rest he did not say or write "
464056,JohnF,2010-05-07 17:46:00,3494,The Pentagon and the defence contractors probably won't give permission.  JF
464115,Musky or Specks,2010-05-07 21:40:00,2710,Would never happen they owe our greedy banks way to much money. The banks would undergo existence failure if the price of oil dropped to low.
464145,Billy Bob,2010-05-07 23:00:00,5865,Sounds GOOD...now who wants a piece of my....
464201,scuro2,2010-05-08 02:31:00,904,Looks like another one of the bogus statements like the one from Bill Gates.
464202,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-08 02:33:00,0,i swear some of that was glenn beck.  unfortunately it can't be posted as being a quote by him because then nobody would take it seriously.

464324,Terry,2010-05-08 16:27:00,14456,well yeah but Robin did not write this thing
