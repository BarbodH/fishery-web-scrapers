464533,rbaquial,2010-05-09 05:24:00,968,"Hey Folks,  Just wanted to ask a quick question, any idea where I can get BRASS BEADS (for building your own In-line Spinners) for CHEAP? I know stores like BPS might have 'em; But I'm curious if MICHAELS (the Art Store) would have them? If anyone can advise on this, I would greatly appreciate it!!  Thanks in Advance, A2F"
464534,Syn,2010-05-09 05:38:00,519,"ebay or http://lurepartsonli...uct_list&c=1048   Last time I checked lureparts ships USPS at very reasonable rates for small quantity items.  edit: art stores should have them, curry's also comes to mind and specialty bead stores in Toronto (use google maps with ""beads"" in search pattern). Might want to bring along your wire to make sure the hole diameter is big enough."
464540,Roy,2010-05-09 06:36:00,13728,Buy them from luremaking.com. An Ontario company with great customer service. Download their catalogue from their site if you like...bonus is that they sponsor this community of ours.
464561,outllaw,2010-05-09 10:50:00,1232,"lure making has a fast efficient customer service. if your into hobbyist building, dont hesitate. . as ROY said they sponsor and are canadian based."
464590,rbaquial,2010-05-09 14:05:00,968,"Thanks Folks!! I really appreciate your input!  And yeah, I've already looked @ LureMaking.Com - That's how this whole idea started!  I'm looking into getting their ""In-Line Bucktail Tying Kit"" - I tried ""Fly-Tying"" @ the Outdoorsman show (I think it was) and have always wanted to get into making my own in-line spinners.  Thanks again folks!"
464591,Handlebarz,2010-05-09 14:08:00,3790,third one here for Luremaking.com they are great and fast. the ones from MICHAELS are hollow and I dont think they have big ones.  http://www.luremaking.com/catalogue/catalogue-index/catalogue-items/solid_brass_beads.htm
464592,Terry,2010-05-09 14:08:00,14456,luremaking.com is a great place to buy from
464593,shane,2010-05-09 14:09:00,652,You could also check out the craft section at your local dollar store. Sometimes you can find useable stuff there.
