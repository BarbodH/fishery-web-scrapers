464372,Dara,2010-05-08 19:38:00,3052,There is one about 8 miles or so up the road on the left for eyes...decent enough spot to launch a 14' on a trailer. There is also a splake pond they will show you. There are nice big eyes in the lake the cabins are on but they will tell you there aren't any fish in the lake because they don't want guests fishing their private stock
