Well....we never got round to catching any trout, we did not even try actually, the bass fishing was so good from the 3rd cast onwards. We were both using gulp 3"" minnows on a jig and landed well over 40 smallmouth in 3hrs, nothing over 18"" but a blast none the less.   ONE OF THE BESTEST DAYS BASSIN I'VE HAD ...EVER!  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="""
464242,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-08 11:46:00,0,Great vid. You certainly got yourself a slice of paradise up there. Wouldn't mind seeing a vid of the trout being caught.
464262,rickster,2010-05-08 13:39:00,495,awesome vid Simon way to go gotta love when the bass hit like that  Rick
464265,limeyangler,2010-05-08 13:51:00,5204," Thanks JB...like i said we never really tried for trout in the end, we gave it a token effort of half an hour, but the high winds (gusting to 45kmh) anywhere else on the lake apart from the shore we were on made it difficult to go exploring.    Thanks Rick....thought you might like that one. good job on the walleye the other day whilst soaking for trout...maybe this year we'll get out...lol...we say it every year but never do...lol."
