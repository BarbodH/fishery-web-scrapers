I have one that almost new and it broke on the weekend.  I know they used to be dealt with out of Mount Hop but I think Shimano took that whole operation over.  Any info would be greatlyu appreciated.   Darren"
464822,Spiel,2010-05-10 12:40:00,9065,"Shimano took over the Loomis line of rods, Frontier is a different animal and won't be covered by Shimano warranty to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately I think you'll find that you're stuck with a broken rod."

464827,bucktail,2010-05-10 12:54:00,1857,Bummer  But thanks guys!  Hmmm what shall I get to replace it with?
464828,Raf,2010-05-10 12:56:00,3495,something with a warranty
464862,HTHM,2010-05-10 14:44:00,4082,"Depends where it is broken, it may be possible to repair it. I have a frontier that was crushed, and Spiel was able to repair it so well, that it is unnoticable."
464863,cuzza,2010-05-10 14:46:00,467, LMAO!  Shimano make some good stuff and their spares service has always been top notch.
