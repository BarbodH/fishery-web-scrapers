Thanks to Greg and Cudz for the pointers. I only saw Greg's today but no big deal, info taken for the next trip. Went to Love to Fish and got some minnows....but man what were those  small.....dark....very thorny, hard to put them on the hook.... Anyhow....we launched at Innisfil...not much water but manageable... Started around the islands and took us a while to find them but it was busy hour once we did....almost all very good size...12""+. Suddenly they disappeared....so we went on a ride....across the lake to the pack off Torah ....lots of bites there but smaller size... Started raining around 1pm so we called the day. Kept 50 between both of us and must have released that many more. Fund day for sure. May try one couple more times if I can get away. Best depth was 32 fow. Minnows and small Rapalas did well.  Here is the fun at home with the little one taking part as well    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

390781,bigugli,2009-10-07 00:19:00,6138,You did well. I'm sure your son had a blast.
390836,jaydub,2009-10-07 02:05:00,145,"Wow, you got your work cut out for ya.  Nothing like taking the little guy fishing and landing 100+ perch   (ok, well I can imagine there's nothin like it).  I need to take my little guy out once more this year and try and duplicate your day...I'm kinda craving some fried up perch myself!"
390889,solopaddler,2009-10-07 03:14:00,8605,Emil that's great!  Did you make it up north in late September?
390992,misfish,2009-10-07 15:38:00,29133,"And to think,ya dont need a boat to get them this time of year.  Nice looking feed."

391203,douG,2009-10-08 04:37:00,2693,"Nice work, Emil - great to see you and the Lads back here."
391245,icefisherman,2009-10-08 14:02:00,952," Couldn't do it Mike. Too tight time wise and it was colder than my wife liked for a late camping trip. Maybe next year in the summer.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
