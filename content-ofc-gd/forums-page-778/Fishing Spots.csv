I like fishing for bass and pike and I am looking for spots to go fishing with a couple of my friends this Saturday. I am located about 75 km Southwest of Toronto, near Hamilton Ontario. I am willing to drive anywhere up to 200-250 km hours away from my location. I would love to get somewhere I can rent a boat this time of year. Even if your unsure how the fishing is at the place I will still take any recommendations because I am willing to try out the spot.  Hope to hear from you, Thanks guys!"

I believe they said they pay $900.00 to the Government for a Marina permit per year Richard"
391523,Uncle Buck,2009-10-09 15:22:00,1000,$900 doesn't seem bad... figure at $10/launch that's only 90 boats... i'm sure they do way more than that on the launch...
