While im there I was thinking of getting my groomsmen and best man out for a short fishing excursion...  We'll be at the Grand Bahia PRincipe Akumal resort in the Mayan Riviera, Mexico.. about 30 minutes outside of paya del carmen.   If anyone has any information on some fishing options out there, shoot me a msg or reply to this post.  Any helps greatly appreciated!"

Never caught a fish, well one small mackeral.  At one point the guides started going nuts and yelling in spanish to each other, so I think there might of been one marlin around.  It was quite expensive.  Afterwards we were hearing we would of been better off fishing off of Cozumel.  A short ferry across from Playa.  Probably the same price, but better fishing I hear."

He's a professional cave diver (in case you want to explore some cenotes underwater) and he's a spearfisherman if you want to swim down 100 -150' on one breath of air and spear your dinner.  He knows all the locals. In fact he probably taught some of them english at the school he runs. I'm sure Fred would have a good idea of who to hook up with for some long lining or flats fishing.  JF

It's about 2 hours south on Ascenscion Bay.  World-class bonefishing and the lodge is top rate with guides who do everything from tying your leaders to spotting the bones and permit (and maybe tarpon).  Lunch included and you go out in 18 foot pangas with 50hp motors.  Unfortunately my day was very windy and I only landed 2 bones.  Had about 20 shots at them.  Was a great learning experience as it takes a lot of skill spotting bones in the flats.  Was pricey though.  $450 for the day, plus $100 for the van ride, plus $50 tip.  That was USD back 4 year ago!"

Hope this helps and congrats on your wedding."

It goes right into downtown Cancun at the north end. I'm not sure why you'd wanna go there but it works, and they have very modern terminals at Playa del Carmen and Cancun. At the smaller places they drop you off on the highway and you have to walk in. Dunno how far it is from the highway into Pureto Morelos. I can give you a name of a guy I used to dive with who now runs a shop there. He could at least tell you how far it is from the highway. They say there's a very nice reef just offshore there. It used to be a fishing town but now it's all about snorkelling and diving.  JF"
