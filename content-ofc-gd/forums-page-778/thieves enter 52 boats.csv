A local resident saw some suspicious males at the city marina around 8 p. m. One male was spotted climbing over the gate and then crawling along the walkway.  Officers attended and located a male hiding near a boat and another male inside a vessel.  The investigation revealed that the thieves were searching for alcohol and had entered 52 boats in their quest for booze.  Four males were arrested, including two 16-year-olds, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old. They each face 52 counts of break-and-enter, two counts of possession of break-in tools and one count of possession of stolen property.  All four suspects were held for bail hearings."

391350,misfish,2009-10-08 21:42:00,29133, They still managed to get into 52 boats.  Where was the secuirity????????? BONE HEAD RENTALS
391371,Rizzo,2009-10-08 23:04:00,4754,"wow, it would take some time to break into 52 boats! Why not just pool your $$$ and get the 20 year old to buy your booze??"
391374,misfish,2009-10-08 23:12:00,29133,"What pisses me off the most about this. They,ll run yer ars away from the docks for fishing,but let the thieves just do as they please. I know Im getting carried away,but this whole marina here in Barrie is a joke.   Oh did I mention Im on meds.LOL"
391376,BillM,2009-10-08 23:23:00,17367,"They have rent-a-cops at the marina?   I've never seen them, lol."
391517,LeXXington,2009-10-09 14:59:00,1928,They will get off with a slap well maybe the 18 and 20 year old might get something but I don't thing so.
391536,bigbuck,2009-10-09 15:58:00,2449,"Hopefully it'll be a lesson for these boneheads. As for the Marina, they will have to re-think their security arrangements because 1 or 2 boats is bad enough but 52!!!!! Shameful, any damages should be picked up by the marina in good faith otherwise there will be 52 customers looking elsewhere for slips/storage."
