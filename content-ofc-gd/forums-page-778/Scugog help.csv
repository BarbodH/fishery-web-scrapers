391288,stan_133,2009-10-08 17:57:00,77,just looking to pick up some tips for fall fishing at lake scugog. thanks.
391321,johnnyb,2009-10-08 20:22:00,3413,"fishing for what?  Crappie?  Bass?  Muskie?  Walleye? If it's muskie...get out there with some big bucktails and drift over large weedflats.  If you get weeds that are deep enough to rip a large crankbait, like a supershadrap or believer, go for it. I've found that some pretty chunky largies will also hit your bucktails.  that's all I got...good luck!  Causeway Bait shop is a good stop to make...he's really helpful, and I believe he sells the pre-marked Dave Mercer maps."
391446,fish-miester,2009-10-09 02:34:00,864,ya what are you targeting ? i was out the other day usin a buck tail and caught two nice largies on the around 3lbs each.. but thats all i got .. other then maybe a cold.. but i really wasnt out long
391507,stan_133,2009-10-09 14:11:00,77,i wanna target bass and walleye. i was thinking live bait because of he cooler water water but wasn't sure.
