390687,Terry,2009-10-06 19:41:00,14456,"no I was keeping it a secret as I was hoping to go but now that I find I can't  go, others should get the chance  I always kick myself when I  find I missed something because I forget to check the other section and that's why I like only one section for everything  then I would miss nothing   and I do, GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS"
390691,irishfield,2009-10-06 19:51:00,26272,The bloom is between Carrying Place and Deseronto... so shouldn't effect the area that we generally fish the BOQ for big pickeraleyes.
