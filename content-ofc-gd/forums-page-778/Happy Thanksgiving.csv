391616,Roy,2009-10-09 21:22:00,13728,"And a Happy Thanksgiving to you and to everyone. To me, Thanksgiving is the sanest of our holidays. It's my favourite. It's a time when we share a meal, our harvest, with family and friends. Of course this can be done  any day or everyday but Thanksgiving reminds us to at least share what we  have once a year no matter how little you might think it is.  Have a super weekend everyone."
