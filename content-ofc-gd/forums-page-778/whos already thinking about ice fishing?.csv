391136,Rizzo,2009-10-08 00:18:00,4754,"no no no...still some time left to get the boat in the water. One more trip up around here (Friday), and then the boat likely heads Niagara way. Hope to get out on the upper 3 or 4 times this fall, including a g2g for musky closer I hope. Won't be thinking about ice fishing until March when it starts to warm up! Guess I'm kind of a fairweather ice fisherman"
391141,Greencoachdog,2009-10-08 00:34:00,8163,"Picture this if you can!!!... no closed seasons on freshwater fish, open water 12 months a year!!!   ... hunting season is for those that aren't worth a crap at fishing!!!              It sux to be y'all eh!"

391185,limeyangler,2009-10-08 02:54:00,5204,"never stopped thinking about icefishin.....LOVE IT!  just bought this  little tilting 6' x 8"" sled trailer yesterday for $300, ........new lights, new chains, new tyres(but i'm gonna put fatboy tyres and rims on and use existing as spares), new hitch, new decking( needs waterproofing treatment).......now no more borrowing my uncles trailer....READY TO GO!....and there was half an inch of ice on my minnow storage sytem(5 gallon bucket....lol) this morning...happy days!

391210,Fishnwire,2009-10-08 05:56:00,983,"I'm going to do a little pre-ice fishing icefishing-type fishing on Monday.  My buddy says the crappie are stacking up under the docks at his marina.  We set up a fishfinder and use an ice rod and vertical jig the same as we would do in the winter.  He told me that another guy we know was down last week and apparently he got over 50 in a day.  My wife is dragging my to Ottawa for her nephew's wedding this weekend or I would be going tomorrow.  I'm eager to do a little ice fishing...but I know darn well that by the end of January I'll be craving the ""plop...plop...plop...SMASH!"" of a SMB destoying a top-water bait.  I'm not ready to pull up my dock or flip over my boat just yet."
391242,mistyriver1,2009-10-08 13:40:00,600,"I'm in Grande Prairie Alberta this week on business and it's snowing right now (second day in a row) and it's currently -5 with a wind chill of -12  .  Going down to -10 tonight.  Roads are all ice covered.  So to answer the question of the post, yeah I've thought about ice fishing this week."
391244,BillM,2009-10-08 13:44:00,17367,Steelhead season is never over!!!!  No ice fishing for me.
390907,pike slayer,2009-10-07 04:27:00,1177,"So i almost like ice fishing more then soft water fishing. i love jumping on the sled, breaking trail into a remote northern ontario lake that cant be accessed in the summer and finding spots on a lake and pulling that fish through a small hole, such a rush! I think about ice fishing all summer long and all winter long i think about summer fishing haha i guess i always have something to look forward to. So the weather forecast is calling for snow this weekend in the algoma district and that is really getting me thinking about ice fishing. i'm getting a list of what i need for the sled so its good and ready and im going through what i need for lures, rods, new auger blades, etc. Something i want to buy this fall is a floatation jacket to be ready for the worst. now can i just get away with a jacket and that will keep me afloat or do i need the pants to? also are there any ""cool"" jackets out there for not a crazy price? those bright orange helly hansen suits are just plain ugly(sorry guys that own and wears one)i want a regular looking jacket that i can keep afloat but also something i can wear sledding or going to the out on the town without looking ridiculous."
390912,Terry,2009-10-07 09:09:00,14456,"love getting to a new lake in the winter, but not thinking about it...yet  you can buy the snowmobile flotation jacket in many colors but they cost"
390915,Greencoachdog,2009-10-07 10:22:00,8163,"I was thinking about ice while I was fishing yesterday... I thought, ""I need to buy a bag of ice to put on these fish so they don't spoil on the way home."""
390925,bigugli,2009-10-07 11:27:00,6138,"Have to admit, I've been thinking about it a bit lately. The crunch of snow underfoot on a cold morning. Seeing that first fish come up through the hole.  Watching my son go through the ice yet again"

390936,johnnyb,2009-10-07 12:17:00,3413,Yup...alread had a couple dreams about pulling fat lakers up through the ice    Bring it on!!!!!
390939,LucG,2009-10-07 12:18:00,779,"I can't wait! I have a spot marked on the GPS for the Ice Shack, as well as plenty of other areas to try out.  I want to do more back lake ice fishing for trout this year."
390948,dave524,2009-10-07 12:52:00,4508,"Not in the least, tried it many times , never got into it. Glad I live close to the Niagara for my off season fix."
390956,NAW,2009-10-07 13:19:00,4022,I think about ice fishing every day!  I've even started going to the LSMB again daily to see when the boys think the ice will be in on cook's bay  You know you're getting itchy when you start doing that
390959,danbouck,2009-10-07 13:52:00,4380,The boat will be in the water for 2 more months then I'll start thinking about it.
390963,Leecher,2009-10-07 13:59:00,7832,Ice fishing is always in the back of my mind Leechman
390965,troutologist,2009-10-07 14:05:00,951,"Not until that one last open water outing where you stop and seriously think ""whoa we really shouldn't be out here""  Then laugh uncontrolably at your purse carrying buddies and their lack of motivation.  Wait then steelhead season is still going until freezeup. Theres an offseason?"
391000,pike slayer,2009-10-07 16:18:00,1177,"haha well with ice fishing you dont need ice for the fish, toss them on the ice and they turn into torpedos quick haha!! and there is no down time for me for fishing either! the last 2 years im sliding the boat across the ice to get to the main lake then the next weekend im tip toeing across thin ice to get on some eyes lol. then in the spring im out on the ice till its to far to jump from shore to the ice then the next weekend out smelt and steelie fishing. but when the weather is getting cold i start going through inventory to make sure im all set when the time comes. does anyone have any links for floatation jackets that look like a normal looking winter jacket?? or any suggestions? thanks"

Personally, when I'm Ice fishing, I could care less about how I look    The more visible the better.  Usually match a blaze orange hat with my bright yellow/orange floater!"

391026,pike slayer,2009-10-07 17:13:00,1177,"even though im as smart as a pylon i dont wanna look like one hahaha! i want a multi purpose jacket! so far i found this one http://stores.snowmobiletrinkets.com/FXR/2...lack_sx__2_.jpg  its the fxr flotex jacket, it says its not an actual floatation jacket but it can keep you buoyant up to 2hours, im pretty sure if i fell into the drink that i wouldnt last 2hours haha!"
