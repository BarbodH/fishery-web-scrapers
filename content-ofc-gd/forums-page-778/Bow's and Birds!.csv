Had the gear out of the jeep in minutes and decided to wade through an area of new growth forest hoping to put up a few Woodcock with the Boxer.  . We have an understanding... I throw the stick into the heavy bird looking cover he puts the birds up with his ""bull in a china shop retrieves"", When it works I get a bird  and he gets to play fetch LOL.  (German short haired pointer comes in the spring) Anyways, Three birds were put up, and three birds were missed . Always next week. Decided to trade the 28 gauge for the 13 float rod and head towards the river. fished one pool for a few hours and was kept busy with plenty on 2-3lb little bow's along with a larger fish that out played me into a log pile.   Stumbled across a uncovered turtles nest which was kind of neat.  Hoping to take advantage of the fall season again next week.  RF"
