391258,scugpg,2009-10-08 14:57:00,1373,I'm seeing these APS branded outboards popping up here and there - some claiming that they are a china made Yamaha clone & parts will work on either one. Does anyone have one of these or heard good/bad on them? Just curious
391293,bigfish1965,2009-10-08 18:06:00,3382,There was a thread awhile back about them. They are also known as Parsun Outboards. Just looking at their site and they have an odd disclaimer...see if you can spot it on their site.. https://www.parsunengines.com/25HP_4_STROKE_OUTBOARDS.html

391298,JohnF,2009-10-08 18:21:00,3494,Interesting marketing technique. Perhaps a form of reverse psychology?  JF
391322,Roy,2009-10-08 20:24:00,13728, I believe that a Chinese Parsun employee in the translation department might be moving to Tibet soon.
