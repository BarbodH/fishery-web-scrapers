385910,scugpg,2009-09-22 18:00:00,1373," I've seen people fishing wacky rigged senkos in May before...on a well known bass lake...that got a call to the MNR. There is a local dam that is now policed often because of multiple calls to the MNR from various folks and repeated poaching...Trout & Salmon aren't really the target species there either.  If you don't feel comfortable confronting them take some non-suspicious pictures at least...might come in handy.  Whether or not you think the MNR will do anything or not, it should at least be reported....with a person description, vehicle, and license plate. You could call the local police I believe they can also press charges?. Even if it just gets them a visit or phone call....awareness does go a long way with some people. Some will never learn unfortunately but worth a shot."

386604,Harrison,2009-09-24 17:40:00,2202,"Had chat with two youngsters as the waded into the water a day or so before you made this post Photoz.  I can't say I can remember what they looked like, but I assume it went in one ear and out the other. They were fully aware what they were doing was illegal and unethical before I left.   Educated them on the need of fish to head upstream etc.. blah blah.  As I left with my lab, they prooceeded down stream, probably to line others just below the dam.  I usually speak up, but have ran into trouble before and ALWAYS during the fall salmon run and I never wet a line.  Have to take the dog elsewhere for a run.  I am done till Dec in the rivers and finished again in March.  Mitch never needs to leave bowmanville creek during the salmon run, between the pier and the river his work day could be full."
386619,Twocoda,2009-09-24 18:51:00,4130,  I commend you for your efforts Harrison in my mind Mission Accomplished...regardless if it went in one ear and out the other they moved on and if enough of us did the same as you possibly the kids will learn that they cant get away with it because people and cameras like Photoz are watching ....If the ministry is reading this thread ...might not be a bad idea just to post a BOLD sign stating that the dam is monitored and have a dummy cam installed. I bet it would deter some kids that do know better from trying to get away with something. Sure there are people and kids that have no regard and could care less but hopefully a CO would be fortunate enough to be there during these times.  People act differently when they believe a camera is watching  Photoz your camera has done a great justice to this issue regarding awareness ...  Me being a person that targets only salmon and bows (year round) for enjoyment weather its catching or raising ....i formally apologize to you sir if you feel my feathers might have been a bit ruffled ...i commend you for your actions  Take Care ..Good Luck...and try to wet a line in the near future

391905,Jeco Reinoso,2009-10-11 01:50:00,2,all i can say is.................that is ridicolous... i understand that boys will be boys. and i will admit when i was a young boy i did my fair share of snagging and touturing panfish to salmon. but as i grew up i started to aprreciate the sport. and that as in any sport you must have respect for your fellow fisherman and of course the fish. because without the fish there is no sport. what would basketball be without the damn basketball. it would just be 10 guys running from back and forth. i've fished as bowmanville plenty of times for rainbows and salmon. seeing those photos i wasnt shocked i was more disgusted and disappointed. hopefully as those kids grow up they realize that fishing is a sport and like all sports cheating is not how you want to win. recently i went fishing up at port hope and there were plenty of fish to go around. i snagged a few but when i did i was disspointed everytime and tried to unsnag myself theres no sport in it. who wants to fight a fish by the tail or fin? i dont.
385195,Twocoda,2009-09-20 17:12:00,4130,"  all the violations you posted in your response is my case and point ...MNR ,OPP and city cops cant be everywhere all the time ( i wonder if this is why there are speed limit /stoop and scoop/no littering signs etc..   posted throughout the country as reminders) a friendly verbal reminder to a bunch of kids that are doing something wrong wouldnt have hurt anyone ....i dont see any 9mm weapons on these kids so i dont think even if a armed authority that could have showed up would have the need to unholster his/her weapon...  Im a Caucasian and i own two ""white pails"" ( which are converted to carry my most used steel lures for downrigging) i would be more then happy to make you one to accommodate your lures if you so desired but your insinuation again i feel is shameful ( sorry for your train of thought ) i hope you didnt pass your values on to your  candy purchasing kids....  you have  apparent respect through out this board from people and im dillegently looking for a reason to do the same so no strips have been ripped off you by me  Thank you i WILL have a nice day and i hope you do as well"

The local CO in Bowmanville is Mitch Phinny, call the TIPS line and ask for his cell....they will give it to you. He will get you to send the pics to him.

I can't think of any individual that I have fished with who shows more respect for the environment, and the fish he is after. He is also one of the first people to offer help or advice to anyone fishing nearby who might appear to be new at the ""game"". Steve is a stand up guy who I am happy to call a friend.

Knowing what you know now, after seeing these pictures - I expect you to drive over there and grace these children with your presence and guide them to be the stellar angler that you exemplify.  As for introducing the racial scenario, what I believe photoz was trying to do is show that some folks from all backgrounds do in fact, break both the law and accepted norms in fishing practices.  Photoz - you're a good man, don't let Mr. Righteous get the best of you.  Mr. Righteous - have a wonderful evening and I look forward to seeing you at the dam giving your educational talk....  -Sawyer"

385465,Photoz,2009-09-21 14:43:00,792,"Hard to believe . . .  .   we got through a very 'touchie & controversial' subject with a minimum of 'flaming,' not long after someone was asking about why people got their hackles up at each other so quickly on this board? The majority of comments & opinions I saw here & on a similar thread were quite intelligent, AND informative. I had been very hesitant to even say anything, but felt the photos might raise the awareness of what goes on in 'snaggin' season.' Personally, I'd rather see a salmon go home to someone's table that see it rotting on a stream bank. BUT . . . .   if we tolerate the illegal methods of taking salmon . .   .    where does it stop? Ling? Bowfin? Trout? Pike? Musky? And many more. I thank EVERYBODY, whatever your opinion happened to be, for stepping up and making it known."

Since those kids were leaving when I did, there would be no point. All the pictures show is a bunch of kids fishing on the legal side of a dam. You cannot see the hook in either fish in the pictures, so it boils down to MY word against the word of 6 'cherubic l'il angels?  ' I'm quite certain that the MNR ain't about to put up 'WANTED' posters all over Bowmanville to apprehend 'em? Not trying to be snide, but I've spent my share of time on the phone, writing letters, with pictures, all to no avail. What it boils down to and what the Crown Attorney has to consider  . . . .  Is there a reasonable chance of convicting these people on the evidence I am being offered?' In this case, a resounding ""NO!"""

The officer would not do anything saying in a situation like that it is best to MIND MY OWN BUISNESS....I informed him of the assault and he told me it was my word against theres and in court they would end up throwing it out for lack of evidence....I was mad, frustrated, and insulted to the point I got in my car and left without filing a report...Those kids in the pic look young enough and small enough right, like I said I'm 6 foot and 200 pounds and was only 27 when this happened...the 1 man that pushed me and the 2 that attacked me were no bigger then any of those boys...I understand your situation and think the only thing you could have done was put a call in to the ministry regardless of what you thought the results would be...it IS the right thing to do...posting here was also the right thing to do because now it is out there and has made all of us aware of the problem...I suggest to you people who think that confrontation is the right way to go do it with care and caution and never alone...Trust me the end results could be much more then a bag of frozen peas on your boys for a couple days....CALL THE NUMBER and let the proper authorities deal with them as they are trained to do...I commend you Photoz...Great thread!!!!!"

As someone else pointed out, these kids knew not to fish below the dam. Its amazing what five or six 15 years olds can do when they are angry or scared. Moreover, you don't know if someone is packing a knife or worse. There is a reason CO's carry guns."

385598,blaque,2009-09-21 20:16:00,2419," due to the fact, in part..........that these fish become cornered, easily spotted, densely populated, just plain trapped in situations that make them easy pickens for those that want to target them illegally.  Alot of times these fish have no where to go, and as you can see in the pictures, you can walk right up to these pools full of stacked fish and have your way with them if you wished. You wont see this with other species and other types of bodies of water. Or i should say you see this the most with salmonoids. River run fish in large dense populations,  limited to holes and alot of times, stopped at a dam. Its like shootin fish in a barrell"

Now we all know there is no comparison to whats in the grocery store and whats in the river,..but my thought is the snaggers do not.  Im not advocating what I have done in the past regarding snaggers, but it ranges from education to offering to land their fish which I do and then promptly release it, to tangling my line intentionally, to cutting lines with my scissors.  I generally wont call MNR or police as I know they will do nothing."

Photoz is not responsible for the actions of these children..they and their parents are. Posting the pics of poachers of any age or race is absolutely fine. Maybe someone here will recognise one of the lads and have a talking to them. Photoz is a senior member and well respected. You'd do well to have half the heart he does. Photoz is not in any position physically to take on a bunch of teenagers. I will expect you to show more respect and decorum in the future.

385106,steelhead hunter,2009-09-20 08:10:00,152,the first thing you should would have done in that situation is tell them that what they are doing is illeagal and then if they give you a hard time walk away and call the MNR TIP LINE 1-877-847-7667  if they were my kids it would be a long time before they seen a fishing rod again and would never even think about doing something like that again after I got done with them

If it was one of us in our 20's to 50's (some in their 60's) then this is a different story. Some of those kids look under 15.  To me the best thing to be done here is to call the MNR. DONE! If you go back and see it again, call the MNR again.  Hmm...thinking...starting a new post right now called SNAGGING SALMON."
385130,Photoz,2009-09-20 12:29:00,792," I've seen my share of scofflaws and have given up trying to talk to them, to inform them they are breaking laws. Even if I DID carry a cell phone, do you really think the Ministry is going to drop everything, and IMMEDIATELY dispatch one of their finest, with lights & sirens, to the scene? Their closest representative could be several hours away. And those kids OBVIOUSLY knew the laws well enough to stay up on the LEGAL side of the dam, and not venture into the pool full of fish below! While down in the park, I ALSO observed (1) People throwing lit cigarette butts into the shrubbery along the path. Thats called littering. (2) Carrying, drinking from, then throwing away, a beer can. Littering, and illegal consumption of alcohol. (3) Two people's dogs taking a big dump along the path, that they never cleaned up after. (4) A car comes speeding into the parking lot, at least doing 30  -  35 klicks, nearly running over a nice friendly Lab . .    running loose! These are all violations of various laws, that took place right in front of me . . .   .    which ones should I have informed they were breaking the law? And what do you think the responce would have been? What do you think the response of a half dozen teenagers, to ONE ol' guy, going ""tsk, tsk, tsk . .    that's naughty, AND illegal?"" Over the years I've taken enough abuse, from trying to advise people, who are clearly breaking laws . . .   or calling in with full information on some of 'em . . .   NEVER seeing anybody show up. There are people (aka law enforcement personnel) who draw from $50,000.00+ salaries per year and are highly trained to oversee this . . .     and why do ya think they are armed? As far as introducing race into the picture, you can bet there'd be a lot more negative responses if these guys were carrying the dreaded 'white pails!' I did what I felt was the most prudent thing I could think of . . .   I KNOW the Conservation Officers monitor these boards, perhaps they'll send a couple over for a look . . .     and MAYBE somebody will alert the parents of these kids as to what they were up to. Walk a few miles where I've tread in the past, BEFORE ya start rippin' strips off me for acting in a responsible manner, and doing what I felt best suited the situation! And if I took MY kids in a candy store when they were small, they would NEVER have stolen (yes, 'sampling' IS stealing) ANYTHING, they were taught NOT to steal by ME!! Have a nice day."
