My first reaction was to turn on the camera and capture what I could...Still brings chills, your friend must be going through a hard time loosing something as big as you said."

But the water snakes couldn't mind their own buisness ..       9.8 lbs...    6.8 lb.....    The release ....     Back to the Smallies ...  Heres 24/7 with a 4lb 15 and 7/8 ths of an ounce  Football        Some Nature pics ...

391058,Fishing 24/7,2009-10-07 19:04:00,709,too bad paul missed out on his first fish over 5 lbs this year...  the fished jumped and the jig went flying .... right smack into his face to bring him back to reality.  it was more like a 6 + lbs small mouth to me but we will never know.  all i know is that we caught 6 or 7 4 lbs plus that day and when he missed that freak of nature we were both traumatized for life.  BIG fish leave deep scars be aware!  my 4.15lbs 7/8 Oz had no show compaired to this fish!  But now we know there in there...........................  6 lbs smallie hunt ACTIVATED!!!
391100,Greencoachdog,2009-10-07 22:51:00,8163,Looks like Paul needs to quit accusing me of telling fishing stories and delete some pics from his photobucket account!!!  
391138,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-08 00:25:00,2038,  Wow ..  You mean to say the 1000 I took off the other day wasn't enough....
391286,Leecher,2009-10-08 17:55:00,7832,"    Paul,  Photobucket has a monthly limit of Megabytes for uploading.... you've just exceeded that amount.  Your pics are still there.... they're just disabled until you upgrade to PRO (which comes with a monthly fee) or wait til the end of the month so that the total goes back to zero  Deleting old photos will not help in this case.... you either upgrade or wait"
