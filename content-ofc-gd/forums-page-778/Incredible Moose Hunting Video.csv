391428,Daplumma,2009-10-09 01:45:00,1961,Leah has beenfeeding that old turkey since forever.I doubt she stopped just for you Brian. Joe
391459,siwash,2009-10-09 05:43:00,683,"  More humane? I never understood this arguement... it's an animal... the creator put it on this earth to be consumed.. Go to a slaughter house and see how ""humane"" your steak is being treated..  whether it dies instantly or within 2 minutes, what's the diff? please, enlighten me"
391460,ChrisK,2009-10-09 09:53:00,2772,"Great video TJ. Thanx for putting that up. The guy waited until he had a perfect shot and placed the arrow right were it counted. Takes a lot of nerve and patience to do that,take it from a fellow hunter. The urge to take a shot before its time is almost overwhelming in these situations especially with a big animal in front of you like this bull.  Cheers !!"
391529,gdelongchamp,2009-10-09 15:44:00,199, Just a personal choice.  They are beautiful animals.  I lived in Red Lake for twenty years and saw a lot of moose in my travels and a lot of moose killed. I guess I saw too many killed and the general attitudes of a lot of hunters after killing them turned me off to hunting them.
391558,troutologist,2009-10-09 17:11:00,951,"heres a question for you folks that are up to date on bowhunting. I have bowhunted (not in maybe 10yrs) taken a few deer with the bow and have seen they variation in time til expiration with solid shot placements. My bow is probably 15 yrs old by this point and shoots aluminum arrows 125 grain tips.  To my question, is there a possibilty that the use or lighter, faster carbon arrows and 100 grain tips makes for less shock? I know the penetration of modern setups seem to be much better. Has it been determined that this higher speed, smaller projectile is preferred for hunting or does a higher IBO rating sells more bows?  I was at the archery range a month ago testing satillite tags deployment and saw guys shooting new bows. Can you quiet them down at all or do you count on speed to beat the ""string jump"" Seems like my old bow was far quieter."
391589,anders,2009-10-09 19:46:00,1168," I have seen a heart shot drop a moose in its tracks...the neck shot is a shot you do not take!!!  The chance of hitting the spine in the next is very poor...  Great vid...those bow hunters did everything perfect in my books...from patience, to patience, more patience, and then perfect shot, then more patience, and even more patience while it expired.  A lot of respect was shown and even heard to that moose in that video."
391591,richyb,2009-10-09 20:00:00,774,"  In the archery world SPEED KILLS.  With an arrow your not killing with SHOCK, you are killing by slicing organs. Faster arrows produce flatter trajactories which means more room for error in judging shot distance. You can add string silencers , limb savers , shock absorbing stabilizer bars to reduce noise of the bow. I am shooting a bowtech 101st ariborne shooting 340 fps !!!!! It makes a little more noise than my old goldeneagle shooting 270fps but I think that the differance in speed makes up for the string noise."
391610,misfish,2009-10-09 21:06:00,29133," Yes the speed does make up the dif. My new sidewinder,315fps crossbow, makes a louder then norm sound on release,but by the time the deer hears it,the arrow has already done it,s job.  They make them so fast these days.  Thanks guppy. I respect your ways. Im sure there,s a time ,we all go there."
391795,trapshooter,2009-10-10 13:49:00,1234,TJ - this hunt happened 60k N of Ear Falls ON.  The guys were staying at Woman River Camp.  My good friend Graham was also there at the time and verified the location.
391799,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-10 14:19:00,0,  No shot is hard at 5 yards standing still. Head shots and ones right below the ear/neck/spine are good. Lights out. I should have said I've seen a few animals hit in the heart that ran up to 1/2 mile. My point was that most animals do not hit the ground and die right away. Its usually not instantaneous.
391810,AzuluSpookd,2009-10-10 15:10:00,348,"Andy....my Doe last year, 20 yards away, slug shot, double lung shot and destroyed the heart, thing still ran 50 yards and stood there for a while wondering what just happened:) My bull last year, 250 yards with my 300 Win Mag, double lung shot, decided to go swimming in the water after the shot, got him turned around in the middle of the lake by firing two shots near him, swam back to shore, stood up and dropped.  I've seen moose drop instantly, deer drop instantly but not really that common...."
391168,misfish,2009-10-08 01:37:00,29133,"Anyone have the vid of the king bull that was taken with a bow? I have been looking for it,but cant find it. Great shot and a massive animal."
391170,brkygetr,2009-10-08 01:40:00,425,help me out TJ...how come I can't watch the video...what don't I have operating on my confuser!!!!!! I NEED TOO SEE!!!!!
391172,misfish,2009-10-08 01:49:00,29133,  PG14.  JK
391174,richyb,2009-10-08 01:56:00,774,Sweet video.
391175,brkygetr,2009-10-08 01:59:00,425,"damn.....I only made it to pg13...seriously though where can I find it not on here...can't seem to watch videos for the past couple of months...must have done something to the fuser during a 'period of enlightenment'.... and by the way IMHO a skilled shot wether blades or lead will drop an animal...if its a chicken in the bush with a blunt point to the noggin, or a massive bull on a shore line witha 4 bladed retractable Muzzy... Its gonna fall. At that point its a matter of the tracking skills to get the meat to the freezer.... as was mentioned 'meats meat'!    IT SNOWED HERE TODAY!!!! BIG BLACK CRITTERS GOIN DOWN! Good luck too all."
391188,siwash,2009-10-08 03:11:00,683,This one will  make you pee your pants..  
391194,cram,2009-10-08 03:47:00,1733," The double lung shot - certain for sure.  I was referring to the shots that miss a bit.  Have seen a lot of deer with broken arrows in them.  Everyone has.  Assumed a bullet drops the animal much faster.  Maybe i'm wrong though - have never seen a large animal shot with a gun either (just birds).  And that said, maybe the arrow is more humane....if you don't get it just right, the animal doesn't necessarily die (the way it usually does iwth a bullet).  btw - sorry for derailing the thread. Its a very cool video, and i'm the first to dig in to a nice venison steak (am yet to taste moose).  I am not against hunting."
391200,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-08 04:29:00,0,you're going to like Moose.......
391217,Daplumma,2009-10-08 11:33:00,1961,"How many deer do you consider a lot?I live in an area with more deer per sqare mile than most places.I have been hunting for a very long time.I help my buddy out butchering deer in the fall,we cut up hundreds of deer a year.I have seen only one deer come in with an arrow broken off in it.The blade was wedged in the top of its shoulder blade.I have never seen one walking around with an arrow broken off in him.Either we have much more ethical hunters here who dont take sketchy shots(I doubt it)or you are reading too many P3TA fliers(I suspect this is the case). Joe"
391219,Jay T,2009-10-08 11:43:00,282," I have shot Deer, Moose and Bear with my Bow, and all have expired within minutes (if that) and not travelled far at all. The one thing that is critical when hunting with a bow or a gun is shot placement! In order to get a good clean kill you need to hit the vitals. Just a little info for you, with an animal that is shot with a bow they will expire due to massive hemorrhaging from the 1""-2"" cut through the cavity. With gun shot they will expire due to the shock and hemorrhaging because the bullet is not sharp and it is punching through their cavity, both are effective either way. Just thought I would point out the obvious, that a clean kill needs good shot placement with any weapon.  This is an awesome video, and it makes me want to do some moose hunting again in the near future, man do they ever get your heart racing when they come in."
391234,irishfield,2009-10-08 13:20:00,26272,"You wanna know where TJ.... here ya go. This came from Jim @ Dad's  Being from Temagami, thought you might be interested - One of our Reps just stopped by on his way northern to hunt, and told me about his buddies from the Sault who got a 57"" Bull at 5 yards with a bow last week up by Kenora. It will apparently score second largest bull taken by a bow in Ontario once they can score it. He told me that the Bull was making a roaring like noise, and after it went down another Bull comes out and started fighting with it. I called Bull, and he told me they video taped it and put it on youtube - sure enough watch this video."
391250,trapshooter,2009-10-08 14:26:00,1234,awesome video!  What a thrill!  Can't wait to go moose hunting.... a week and counting.... have to catch some big fall muskies first though.  Life is tough.
391254,cram,2009-10-08 14:37:00,1733," Pretty cool with hunting.  You're putting me in the wrong bucket.  Maybe just luck or i'm seeing the same deer(s).   Have seen 2....one iwth mark, and another with the bit sticking right out of it (feeding in parents yard)...and have a friend who hunts and lost a deer that he shot as well.....(which i felt like calling him an ass for but bit my tongue).  Anyway - we're derailing the thread.   Happy to go over it view PM or in another thread if you like.   And, if you have moose steaks i'd love to try them."
391305,tonyb,2009-10-08 18:40:00,1637,"What a rush!!! what a video..experience of a lifetime to say the least.  Interesting to see the instinct of the 2nd animal take over and start rutting, imagine the stories the forest critters will be telling about that moose that actually killed another moose just by rutting  hehe  Great reach with OFC yet again...thanks for sharing the info Wayne, makes it that much more interesting. "
391307,irishfield,2009-10-08 18:43:00,26272,"Rutting... I thought it was more like ""come'on Brother.. get up.. we've got cows to chase"" !"
391308,tonyb,2009-10-08 18:46:00,1637,Could be ...i didn't have my sound on and am not a hunter so I could be off.  Regardless...not something you get to see everyday
391311,TJQ,2009-10-08 19:05:00,7806,Kenora eh.. I think ill head that way shorlty.
391315,blarg,2009-10-08 19:35:00,289,"That was a great video, I certainly would like to see a faster kill though, to each his own but I wouldn't have wanted to watch that with only a bow in my hand, with a rifle i would have done my best to put him down with follow up shots. Either way, it was a great shot and I would have loved to have been there, just not with a bow."
391317,bigfish1965,2009-10-08 19:51:00,3382,"Maybe I am getting soft in my old age..but I certainly prefer to see the animal drop right on the spot. I realize a bow is more of a challenge, but for a beast that size, I would be using a 30.06. But that was an amazing video and watching that other bull stand over it like he did it was quite amazing."
391329,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-08 20:51:00,0,"Animals are stronger than you think RicK. Even a 30 06 through the same spot would take the same time to go down not to mention that they can go a good distance before expiring. Only a Neck, head or spine shot would drop it in its tracks. Even with a heart shot they can go on stream for a bit. That's why I say to myself when they show...""BAG ""O"" MEAT"".........BANG!......No waste and they drop. I wanted the same thing when I took my first shot at an animal...I kept shooting. There was no bag ""O"" meat left......"
391372,gdelongchamp,2009-10-08 23:09:00,199,"I put away my guns years ago and no longer hunt. I would prefer to shoot them with a camera.  In regards to a lot of the comments ie; bullets or arrows, It makes me think back of all those moose that were shot once with a poor shot and were able to either walk away or run away for quite some distance and then  given up by hunters. It happens more often then we like to admit. 30-06, elephant gun or whatever, the size of bullet does not matter as much as the placement of the first shot. Wounded moose can run a long ways into heavy brush when the sound of the gunfire reaches them. Using arrows, they are not sure what hit them and wont run in a panic it appears. I use to guide moose hunters but I never call myself an expert on the subject."
391375,misfish,2009-10-08 23:20:00,29133, What changed your mind ? Just asking.
391377,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-08 23:28:00,0,  I put them away after two kids.   I usually pick some meat up after season from friends. Cause Wayne won't let me take on off his Landing Strip......
391385,misfish,2009-10-08 23:48:00,29133,Theres nothing there Andy. I was fooled too.LOL
391389,Daplumma,2009-10-08 23:59:00,1961,"No worries bud,I'm just a bit sensitive about exaderations when it comes to hunting,,especially bowhunting.Its not easily explained but its such a great feeling to take an animal with a primitave weapon.So much has to not go wrong for it to work.With a gun the game is over shortly after you see the deer.With a bow the game is just getting started when you see the deer.No moose here to hunt but if you are in the area I have a venison steak for ya.

390955,TJQ,2009-10-07 13:17:00,7806,Well worth the watch... a moose gets killed so if your squeemish.. dont press play.  Its a brand new video taken somewhere on Ontario... im gonna find out where..  incredible really.  now I really want to go!!

Pretty cool video though.  Its pretty amazing how aggressive the bulls are at that time of year.  I also really respect the skill and patience of those guys.  I would've been shaking."
391104,Harrison,2009-10-07 23:05:00,2202,"I love the ""push him to the road part"" haha..  We knocked down a bull, cow and 2 calves in one day a few years ago.  3 of them in a swamp, and friends ask for some meat!!!  ya right!  Few sleeps away, packed and ready to go."
391116,misfish,2009-10-07 23:41:00,29133,"WOW. I cant believe they didnt take the second bull.MONSTER Maybe thier tags were filled.  Cram I can side with you on your quicker kill. Im not sure about all hunters,but Im sure there is a sense they wished aswell.Thats hunting with a bow. Now you know why sometimes,deer hunters travel to find thier deer when shot with a bow. To me IMHO,it,s part of the sport.  Thanks boos for that vid."
391121,Harrison,2009-10-07 23:53:00,2202,"Well written Cram and Misfish, hunting with a bow can be fickle at best.  I have knocked deer down in 5secs, and others I thought was a solid hit went for hundreds of yards.  You don't have the impact as with a rifle or shotgun, but a nice clean shot, like the one in the video, you expect a quick harvest as did the guy behind the camera.  But each animal is different."
391127,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-07 23:57:00,0," A hole is a hole weather it's a bullet or an arrow. Same end result. It isn't for everyone or understood either. Would it have been humane to shoot it again? More certain? It was a double lung shot. Wasn't going far. Truth is, with an arrow it has no idea anything is wrong. It sure didn't feel that razor sharp arrow passing right through. There's a ton of misunderstanding I guess if you haven't done it personally."
391130,misfish,2009-10-08 00:08:00,29133,"GB,I feel there is a dif between an arrow as compared to a slug or bullet.Much more damgae is done with a firearm,IMO. The arrow will pierce through,where as a bullet or slug will accually tear the crap out of everything. Now 00buck that will bounce around inside distroying everything."
391147,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-08 00:49:00,0,sure there's more damaged meat with a bullet.  ..but a blood hole through an animal is a dead animal Brian....I wasnt comparing how much damage is done.
391151,misfish,2009-10-08 01:00:00,29133," Hey I,ll have ya know,ahhhhhh forget it.You wouldnt believe me anyways  Meats meat.LOL  Wait I,ll tell ya. My first deer I ever shot(and my pop is my wittness) I put a shot at 50 yard with a  30-06 right between a rib,took the heart and lung and out between the ribs on the other side.NO WASTE. Yes that was luck.  Now as for my first encounter with my first buck,Thats another story. Dang."
391160,Daplumma,2009-10-08 01:20:00,1961,"There is a big difference between a bullet shot animal and an arrow shot animal.The arrow passes thru with not much knockdown.Shoot a watermellon with an arrow and the shoot one with a slug.Hydrostatic shock messes up the guts and makes jello out of insides that were not even touched by the bullet.Great video,gets yer blood pumping to be sure.
