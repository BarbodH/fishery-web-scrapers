Also, any thoughts on fishing there at this time of year? I don't have much experience with fishing in the fall so any sort of help would be great.  Thanks!"

Orangeville's Island lake is only open Fridays and on the weekends and holidays after Labour Day. As far as fishing, I have no experience there after August.
