391515,LucG,2009-10-09 14:47:00,779,I was wondering what is the best way to rig a jig with a trailing hook.  Do most of yous just tie it on.  Pics would be great too.  Thanks
391519,BillM,2009-10-09 15:06:00,17367,Stinger hooks.  Similar to below.    You should be able to pick them up at any tackle shop.
391521,LucG,2009-10-09 15:18:00,779,"How do you secure those onto the jig.  I have similar ones with a different clasp, that just clip onto the eye.  "
391522,troutologist,2009-10-09 15:20:00,951,slip it on the hook and get a length of flexible float cap or surgical tube and use that to prevent it from slipping off.
391524,BillM,2009-10-09 15:26:00,17367,  The ones I am talking about go right over the hook..  Can't find a good pic of one unfortunately.
391526,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-09 15:34:00,1022,"I like to use about 3-4"" of flourocarbon line (when tied) for my trailer hook when I use worms. Use a really small hook for the trailer hook. If your using big minnows I would go with a longer trailer hook line, depending on the size of the minnow."
391537,northwood,2009-10-09 16:02:00,63,They also have jig heads with a little ring built into the jig head and you attach or snap the wire end of the stinger hook to the ring... i forget the name...  you can find them at any fishing outlet... gagnons. lebarons.
391585,Muskieman,2009-10-09 19:34:00,2472,I usually tie my own.........10lb Trilene XL mono.......Noose Knot at the Jig end {makes for easy removal} and a Fisherman's Knot at the trailer.  The big reason I tie my own is I can make it as long or as short as I want and choose the type and size of hook.   RFS 
391595,Burning Babies,2009-10-09 20:14:00,150,"Yeah, I just tie a #10 treble to the jig eye with a short length of mono and a couple trilene knots."
391597,kickingfrog,2009-10-09 20:22:00,8333,"  Different options for different jigs situations.  If you are using bait you can tie the trailer to the hook bend. I even do this if I'm using ""plastic"" worms for walleye. If you are using some form a plastic body you either need to tie to the jig eye or another ""eye"" if the jig comes with one.  As stated tying your own allows you to very the length to suit you and the conditions.  Some people like to go with heavier line so that it is stiff.  The treble or single hook would depend on how snaggy things are and whether you think the fish are hook shy.  Sharpen your main and trailer hooks."
391630,Leecher,2009-10-09 22:03:00,7832,Here's the jig I use in combination with the stinger...... but I can't seem to find them at CTC anymore The jig's got 2 eyes on it... one at the top to tie your main line and one at the bottom for the stinger hook. Here's the pic    It's my one and only I have left    and got lots of use You can use a minnow or worm with it.  I think it's 1/2oz Great for walleyes!!! Hope this helps ya Leechman
391668,GBW,2009-10-09 23:34:00,8460,"You can get the ""Notrhland Sting n' Fire Ball"" jig at LeBaron still for $2.85 a 2 pack Jacques.  I just checked the LeBaron site..."
