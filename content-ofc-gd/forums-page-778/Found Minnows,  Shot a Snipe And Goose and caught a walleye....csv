390991,Jen,2009-10-07 15:32:00,833,"This has been one of the longest years of my life…  Being off eight weeks from surgery, bed rest and taking care of the kids ,there hasn’t been much time for fishing and hunting…  However I managed to get out a couple of times with Steve (Fishmaster) and the boys.    Second weekend of Goose Hunting we took the boys hunting to Ridgeway…  My son Chris managed two Snipe with one shot, he was on cloud nine! ( And Mom was very proud, Steve has taught him well)  I got a goose, while Steve dropped the other one, Not a lot of action however it was the perfect day…    The walleye season was short lived… Only getting out a couple of times on the boat was a shame… but there were some memorable moments.    Now with the end of lake fishing we are trying to get the boys out perching again… ( How often do we hear this? ""Do I have to wear my life jacket MOM?"" ) grrr    The only issue has been minnows and Steve found them, the tanks are full again… finally    Thanks to the boys for always being helpful and to Fishmaster for going to find bait when his family and customers need it…    Next will be the pictures of the perch… god willing!  Happy fishing everyone,  It is great to be back!  Cheers,  Jen"

391496,Jen,2009-10-09 13:08:00,833,  Now who wouldn't want to move south to Catch Sail Fish full Time!  Maybe I should do a job search...  lol I can't believe it is already time for you to store the boat away... the summer went by too quickly that is for sure...
