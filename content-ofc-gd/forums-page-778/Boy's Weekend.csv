391544,muskeybugged,2009-10-09 16:31:00,282,"So boy's weekend at the cottage last weekend.   The boy's wanted to go Walleye fishing in the nice cozy boat, and I well, have a lot of money invested in musky over the last few years - I'm going musky fishing, ""Who's coming with me?""......  (Insert cricket sounds)    .  So no one was in my boat for this trip except me and my cradle (FisherPete Styles).  Trolled around open water noticing tons of musky boat hitting the shore lines/points hard and all the bait-fisherman were out in 30 FOW.  Marked all kinds of open water fish in the middle of nowhere (until my battery died on me). A little after 10 am my rod screams, bent like the Uglystik commercial.  ""Dang rocks"" I say, figuring a ran shallow with my unit being dead.  Shut the motor off to remove my snag, pull the rod out of the holder then I feel the headshake and run.  Whoo!  After reeling in 120' of line and two awesome jumps close to the boat she's in the cradle.  46"" fish in a 48"" cradle.    "

391619,Leecher,2009-10-09 21:26:00,7832,Congrats on your PB muskybugged She's a real beauty Good job on the release!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
391626,muskeybugged,2009-10-09 21:53:00,282, Yes but I lost the other 2 Musky's that were on the other 2 hooks of the lure at boat side.  If I had someone with me I could have landed all 3 at once!!!  I had this little guy two weekends before as practice landing them solo and figured out the timer thing..... look familiar!    Thanks for the kind comments y'all!
391629,Fisherpete,2009-10-09 21:59:00,1814,"LOL... Fisherpete style... we should make a song, ""Just me'n'my cradle, all full of esox, set that self timer, cuz solo fishing rocks!"" By the way, very nice fish!"
391643,Cudz,2009-10-09 22:39:00,2652,Genetics.  You can by all kinds of liquids and pills nowadays to help with that (so I hear   )  Congrats on a nice looking fish
