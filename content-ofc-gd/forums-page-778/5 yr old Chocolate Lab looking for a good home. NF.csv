390974,graftongal,2009-10-07 14:28:00,145,"Hey Phil,  I am sorry to hear that you had to get rid of Wyatt, and also sorry that I saw this post a few days too late. We have been thinking about getting a companion for Dax and Wyatt would have been great. If I didn't know better, I'd say the two of them were twins!!!  Sandy"
390980,NAW,2009-10-07 15:02:00,4022,"If Wyatt likes to retreive, he's going to absolutly love hangin out with Sinker!  If this post came along a year from now, I'd be all over it."
391208,douG,2009-10-08 05:26:00,2693,I'm feeling a little verklempt *sniff*.
389822,Harrison,2009-10-04 12:44:00,2202,"Hi all, I have asked if I can post.  I have a great opportunity for someone in this community.  I have a 5 yr old chocolate lab named ""Wyatt"".  He is very obedient and well trained.  Great at retrieving.  Used him duck/goose hunting for a couple years.  However, for the past 2 years he has not gotten the attention he needs.  Our family expanded by 2 children and my time with him was shortened as I took a job further from home.  In addition, we have just downsized.  He is an amazing family dog.  It is simply not fair to him.  He needs to run and get out more then we can offer.  It kills us to do this, but it is best for him.  He is a purebred, tatto and CKC papers.  As a part of our family we will be picky on who Wyatt goes home with.  So I thought I would post here and see if there is anyone looking for a wicked dog.  PM me here or email at [emailÂ protected]  Thank you.  "
389827,pigeonfisher,2009-10-04 13:11:00,696,"Sorry to hear that Phil, I can't imagine how tough a decision it would be.  Best of luck in your search."
389829,OhioFisherman,2009-10-04 13:20:00,6623,Great looking dog! It`s snowing there already? Ice safe yet?
389838,Joey,2009-10-04 14:13:00,9122,"Jeez, that must have been a very hard decision Phil, I'll put out some feelers with my family and friends to see if anyone is interested.  Sorry you have to do this, but I'm sure you and your family gave it alot of thought and it is the best thing for Wyatt.  Joey"
389853,GBW,2009-10-04 15:12:00,8460,Sorry to hear about this. I will ask a friend who was looking not to long ago. how is he with other animals?
389854,ChrisK,2009-10-04 15:31:00,2772,"Harrison, I posted this on the OTB.... Ontatiotrophybucks.com http://z4.invisionfree.com/The_Hunting_For...dex.php?act=idx Lots of hunters there and a great opportunity to find your boy a new home.  Good Luck !!"
389857,Bernie,2009-10-04 15:46:00,3190,"I would take him in a heartbeat but my wife would draw the line. We already have one. I would like two. Hope you find a good home for him, he looks a a great pooch."
389861,Harrison,2009-10-04 16:14:00,2202,"Yes all, it is very tough, but he deserves a better quality of life then we can offer right now.  Sad but true.  He is great around other dogs and if you have one for him to play with, all the better in my eyes.  He is an inside dog, never been kenneled or put in a run.  He was crate trained at one time.  We are still in the process of moving, when I get the PC unpacked I'll put up a couple more shots of him."
389865,Sinker,2009-10-04 16:25:00,8692,Check your pm's.  S.

389904,bigfish1965,2009-10-04 18:55:00,3382,Awesome!!!
389908,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-04 19:06:00,2582, Be careful Shayne....I remember what happened the last time a dog was being offered on here   Sorry buddy...couldn't resist.
389912,GBW,2009-10-04 19:33:00,8460,"cool, good for all of you."
389916,Harrison,2009-10-04 19:49:00,2202, Not sure this is something I want to read right now not being in the know.
389920,Ziki,2009-10-04 19:57:00,128,musky bait!!!
389992,bbog,2009-10-04 21:57:00,665,WTG Sinker! Looks like you got yourself a beautiful companion.
390020,Sinker,2009-10-04 22:50:00,8692,"No worries Phil, Wyatt is in good hands here.  We spent most of the day getting to know each other. We went for a good long walk thru the ganny forest, spent a good hour or so fetching at a pond down the road, then went visiting at family and friends. He really is a great dog. Everyone loves him, especially the kids. He's listening to me very well.  Thanks again, and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a shout. Your more than welcome for a visit anytime, and I hope we can get together for a hunt sometime this fall.  I'll keep you updated on his progress, and we'll be in touch this week again for sure.   S."
390024,Sinker,2009-10-04 22:54:00,8692,"    Phil, just to fill you in. There was another lab up for grabs here on OFC, and I had made the first reply in regards to checking it out, and made the mistake of assuming I had dibbs on the dog. That however wasn't the case, and the dog was given to someone else, before I even got a reply back from the original poster.  S."
390029,Harrison,2009-10-04 22:59:00,2202,"Thanks Shayne, he is a great dog and after meeting you I am confident he is in good hands.....oh ya, forgot to tell ya, he loves the water.  Phil"
390031,Harrison,2009-10-04 23:03:00,2202," I got a PM from Steve too, thanks for the clear up, guess I am a little gun shy.  Well, you didn't get that dog for good reason, you now have Wyatt."
390072,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-10-05 00:23:00,0,"Im all misty-eyed dont you just love happy endings, tough descision to have to make, but Im sure Wyatt is in good hands with Sinker."
390076,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-05 00:26:00,2582,Harrison....rest assured you made a good choice. I'm very happy this played out the way it did.
390242,Spiel,2009-10-05 12:18:00,9065,"I got to admit I was tempted to jump on this offer Harrison, but alas the timing is not right. Though I've never met Sinker I feel confident that Wyatt has indeed found a good home. I hope you (Shayne) and your family have a great many years of enjoyment with your new friend."
