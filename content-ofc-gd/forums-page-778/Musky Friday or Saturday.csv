390895,Rizzo,2009-10-07 03:24:00,4754,"Looks like I can get out either Friday or Saturday of this week. Haven't checked my forecast or consulted the moon yet, thought I'd check OFC'ers first on what day looks the most promising."
390899,irishfield,2009-10-07 03:34:00,26272,Friday is rain Roger.. Saturday is wind and showers. Pick your favourite !
390901,Roy,2009-10-07 03:36:00,13728,"If you can, go with Friday, Roger. A little rain on Friday with 10K winds...Saturday, no rain but 25K winds...long weekend = lots of boats everywhere on Saturday...much fewer Friday. Just my opinion.. I haven't looked at the major/minor thing."
390903,pike slayer,2009-10-07 04:01:00,1177,"both days, hit'em hard!"
390924,Lunker777,2009-10-07 11:26:00,866,"Full moon was sunday ! You missed that !  BUUUUUUT ...... rain, snow, wind, sleet, hail,.......... GET OUT THERE !"
390938,johnnyb,2009-10-07 12:18:00,3413,Neither!  You should go with ME! On Sunday or Monday!!!
390942,Alumacraft,2009-10-07 12:22:00,139,"Rizzo don't even think about the Niagara it's going to be mud again after these damn winds, Good luck where ever you end up going.  Rob"
390944,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-07 12:42:00,0,just go when you can.
390953,mistaredone,2009-10-07 13:01:00,913,Beat traffic and crowds and fish friday if you can.
390954,Rizzo,2009-10-07 13:16:00,4754,"Friday it is (assuming work allows)! I'd love to get out both days but wife/kids don't agree. JB we'll get there some day. No niagara for me yet, boat is still in Barrie so I might give Balsam or Gloucester Pool a shot"
391255,bigbuck,2009-10-08 14:37:00,2449,I'm hoping to get my boat back in the water on Saturday and do some fishing in GBay. Sunday is trailer close up time so my days are numbered.
