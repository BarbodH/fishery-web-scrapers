390274,Bly,2009-10-05 13:50:00,1556," lol   Both ""looks"" are good with me."
390604,ccmtcanada,2009-10-06 12:31:00,7971," When my fish can eat both of yours in one gulp, I still win...."
390612,bigfish1965,2009-10-06 13:11:00,3382,More importantly...why is it raining in every pic of you with your fish? Are you the one responsible for this weather?
390615,Rizzo,2009-10-06 13:15:00,4754,At least a decent pike will put up a bit of a fight. I have the same problem but with pesky pesky pickerel who always get in the way when I'm musky fishing. Like reeling in a wet dishrag. For a guy who doesn't eat fish this is a problem
390666,LeXXington,2009-10-06 17:43:00,1928,"Nice catches Cliff.  Pike are good fighters if anything., yea they taste ok if you like that kind of thing"
390700,corvette1,2009-10-06 20:14:00,1765,nice fish cliff take them when you can
390734,Bly,2009-10-06 22:44:00,1556, details
391133,Mike the Pike,2009-10-08 00:15:00,3421, Ya really Cliff.  I know the feeling I catch way too many of those things thats why my friends called me my board name.  BTW those are nice Pike and I would Blame Solo paddler for the bad weather Rick O.  MTP
391271,BucktownAngler,2009-10-08 16:14:00,582,"i would love to keep the pike i catch. they do taste great!  but i cant get the Y bones out, so i dont even bother keeping them"
391273,irishfield,2009-10-08 16:18:00,26272,"Boss.. google ""filleting a pike"". Many ways to do it easily."
390000,ccmtcanada,2009-10-04 22:13:00,7971,"So...in the past, I've had pretty good luck catching the fish that we head out to target...but for some reason, I've noticed a pattern this year...  I go Bass fishing and catch this...   I go Salmon fishing and I catch this....   And today, we went out fall Muskie fishing...figuring to get into some nice Kawartha Muskie...and you guessed it...I caught this.  In a lake where there are a lot more muskie...  That pike is now headed to the dinner table...  Didn't even see a Muskie today...no follows, no missed hits, no nothing...  Oh well, there will be at least a few more fall muskie trips in the next month...hopefully, I can STOP catching Pike!!!!"
390003,highdrifter,2009-10-04 22:19:00,2534,"I feel your pain dude...  That first fish..  Is that a recent catch?   She's a beaut!  At least you're catching somthin...  Buck up, eh?!!  cheers HD"
390005,ccmtcanada,2009-10-04 22:21:00,7971, Don't get me wrong...catching pike is fun!!!  That first one was from the spring...  I see you've been doing a nice job on the TO pike!
390007,Leecher,2009-10-04 22:24:00,7832,Yeah but you forgot to put on the red nail polish   :blink:  Just razzin ya Cliff I here ya on that.... it's out of our control   :lol: It's funny how things work out.... when you set out to target a specific species and can only manage to get into snakes  For what it's worth..... those are some purdy gators you got into!!! congrats Thanks for sharing Cliff! Leechman
390010,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 22:29:00,8163,Are you bragging or complaining???
390012,Twocoda,2009-10-04 22:31:00,4130,try going pike fishing and see what happens...inquiring minds want to know ...  BTW nice fish ..
390027,Sinker,2009-10-04 22:56:00,8692,I hope that pike didn't come out of any of my spots? Good to hear you killed it...........I would have too.  S.
390030,Joey,2009-10-04 23:01:00,9122,"That's because there are too many pike in our waters.  Plus, you can't kill pike, they just won't die  They are good eats and more people should catch and eat them in my opinion.  Get the population a bit under control!  Joey"
390032,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 23:04:00,8163,  Shame on you!... you... you... neanderthal meat hunter fish murderer!!!  ....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm white flakey Pike meat!!!
390035,BillM,2009-10-04 23:07:00,17367,"Cliff, you caught more then I did today!!!!"
390037,Governator,2009-10-04 23:08:00,879,What's with Pike going in Musky waters..... blah  PS Caught a couple 5lb+ gaters this weekend... good times.
390040,jaydub,2009-10-04 23:11:00,145," That's what I was wondering. lol Pike, Muskie, or even Bass I don't care, I am just trying to get something over 5lbs this year!  Those are some great looking Pike man."
390046,snag,2009-10-04 23:26:00,1932,"BOO HOO  Now go write a blues tune dedicated to pike!   Those are nice incidental catches!   Leave your rod in the car and drop me a line buddy!  Say hi to Carole,  xoxoxoxo"
390092,ehg,2009-10-05 00:54:00,2666,Those pike aren't bad more than i have caught this year. Maybe you should go to Toronto harbourfront and try for pike and with your luck you will catch a very rare musky or big walleye there. lol
390101,splashhopper,2009-10-05 01:01:00,2931,Welll Cliffff..... if you took Bly with ya.. sh e could have shown you HOW to catch a Muskie   But hey.... the biggest snot rocket I have caught so far is only 26 inches... at least the ones you are getting are worthy of a pic... 
390104,ccmtcanada,2009-10-05 01:04:00,7971, HA!! She was with me...notice no pictures of fish and her together??  Hope she doesn't read this thread....  I'm a goner...  It's been nice knowing everyone...LOL.
390131,splashhopper,2009-10-05 01:31:00,2931,"uh huh.... juts what i suspected.... she DID outfish you again  Somehow though.... I think she loves ya without you having to be a "" hunter - gatherer HE-Man """
390133,Greencoachdog,2009-10-05 01:32:00,8163,"  HA!!!... just because there's a pic of you holding it, doesn't mean you caught it!... I can hear Miss Bly now ""you hold the fish honey, it doesn't really matter who caught it... and besides, my hair is a mess""!... sound familiar Cliff?"
390142,ccmtcanada,2009-10-05 01:43:00,7971, Hair a mess?  That wouldn't stop a pic of her with a fish...she wears a hat...so that doesn't wash!!!  Oh forget it....LOL
390177,PikeMolester,2009-10-05 02:52:00,428,man I wish I had that problem. Pike to me here in Montreal is like the hardest fish EVAR for me to catch.
390231,Greencoachdog,2009-10-05 11:24:00,8163," Was just kiddin' ya Cliff  , most of us know that Pike usually hate Bly... and if you said you caught a big Pike, you probably did!  How was that thing on the supper table last night? Did you fry it up redneck style or have it another way?"
390236,Spiel,2009-10-05 11:47:00,9065,Your life SUCKS ! I thought you'd be used to it by now.
390247,ccmtcanada,2009-10-05 12:35:00,7971," We gave the pike to Fishnsled...who we saw on the water.  He took his dad fishing for his birthday...so as a little present, we handed it over.  You did give it to him...right Will?? LOL."
390270,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-05 13:40:00,2050,"bah - Nice Gators Cliff!  I'll take Bass / Salmon / Muskie like that any day dude!  Thanks for the report...  ps. Does Bly like the clean shave?  Cheers, Ryan"
390272,Bly,2009-10-05 13:46:00,1556,"Now now Cliff, I did catch 2 fish yesterday  Glen..Pike don't always hate me....I did manage one last weekend.   Jaydub.....hang in there, the best fishing of the year is just beginning!"
