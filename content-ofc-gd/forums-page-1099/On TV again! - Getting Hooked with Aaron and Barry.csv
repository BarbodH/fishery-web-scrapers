148753,tonyb,2008-01-07 17:07:00,1637,I was lucky enough to be able to film a show with Aaron again last May.  The show will air this coming Sunday at 10:00am and 12:30pm on OLN.  We are fishing a week after opening day of trout season with low & clear water conditions and we get into a bunch of fish on roe and the famous pink worm!  I even got to do a quick talk about in-stream structure and how/why fish relate to areas...some helpful info I thought anyway  Tony
