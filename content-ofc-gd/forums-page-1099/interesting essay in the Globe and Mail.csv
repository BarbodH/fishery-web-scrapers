149012,Hookset,2008-01-08 15:09:00,367,"Pretty Cool,  Reminds me of something. Whenever you watch fishing Tourney's on T.V. and after catching a nice fish, the Pro yells ""That's what it's all about !!!""....couldn't be further from the truth.  Stories like this one are ""What it's all about !!!""  Thanks for the reminder.   Hookset."
