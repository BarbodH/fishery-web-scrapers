148013,snag,2008-01-04 21:50:00,1932,"Hi Everyone,  This thread is a long overdue ""thanks"" to Clive (aka-Mepps or ""the nine-fingered tickler) Most of the pics below I haven't posted yet and there's more to come.   I first met Clive almost 2 years ago. We were on a trip to the Bog with FHR, he traded some of his homemade spinners for gas money. Seemed fair at the time (but the lures out paid themselves!!)  I didn't use his lures much until this year when they seemed to be outrageously hot when all other lures were not.  I quickly gained confidence in them, and then they were gone.............(lost in action)  Anyone who thinks that homemade lures are inferior is misinformed. There is a definite science to the materials and weight distribution that Clive incorporates into his spinners  I shunned store bought ones convinced that Clive's were superior. I caved and bought many different varieties only to be disappointed.  Clive went out of his way to make 3 more beauties and sent them off to me just before he moved out East and just after becoming a new papa. Being a new Dad, I greatly appreciated the kind gesture.  Here are some samples: Clives designs  Here is how to make them in a boat in the middle of nowhere: Go to video at bottom of the page    This thread is a thanks, However, I suck. Out of the 3 new spinners, I managed to lose 2 lures within a week; with fish on. One musky (snap my line) and one bass (cut line on rock/zebra mussel). I didn't get a chance to take pics of these great lures. The Chartreuse with red tail was fantastic and I did manage a video where FishingFury is humbly credited for catching a very nice smallie.  Here are some pics:  Here is one of the originals:    Weedless gallery Some of you were curious how it turned out. I now ALWAYS carry a weedless spinner! I had a hard time finding the weedless trebles size 1-3  These next shots are all with weedless trebles. I was very surprised at how well walleye, bass and perch (!) were able to grab the hook.  Here is a poor pic of a newer one with the weedless treble I attached.   Here is that weedless treble with a largemouth bass modeling:  One of the biggest I've caught.  Not a great pic. I'm hold it as close to my body as I can, but the camera is facing up. I thought it was a small musky when it hit. 4.5-5lb easy I have by thumb in the ""Lucid"" position.   This was fun I was told that there were no pike in this lake. So I went out on a rainy day and....    This walleye pic looks photoshopped but it's still my crappy 2.1 mp camera!    This perch was the biggest suprise to be caught on a large, weedless spinner!     Non-Weedless.  Oddly, I couldn't hook a musky on the weedless??????    YET! I had follows with the poor musky snapping at it (boat side) and it just slid out of their mouths. 3 times!! So I switched back. Here is a musky caught on the bloody, wide-gap hook Clive provided    Local pike   Local Smallie   Another pike    I know I have more fish pics thanks to your spinners that I can post; but I have some bidness to attend too (Diapers amigo!?)  Say ""Hi"" to Gillian and Ashen  Thanks again Clive, Yo Da' man!   Cheers,  S."

148077,Greencoachdog,2008-01-05 02:21:00,8163,"I loathe and despise you for hanging on to this report for so long. Babies will be whithin a 1/2 mile radius of where you put them down 4 hours earlier! The further away from you the baby is, the less the dirty diaper will bother you!!!  It was mediocre report with semi-attractive fish, it also looks like you've really let your self esteem escape you.  Maybe if you can find the time in the next eon (inbetween fishin' trips and child rearing interludes) to post another report I may be more considerate.  ... until then..."
148703,snag,2008-01-07 13:56:00,1932," Thanks Joey,  I noticed that you were immortalized on the Fishingfury website too!  Here it is: Joey icing a carp  You're such a star these days, can you autograph my rod?"
148706,snag,2008-01-07 13:59:00,1932, Your criticism is always appreciated.  You still cling onto our tragic past. You've never fogiven me since I left you standing at the alter.  I'm so over you.
148708,ccmtcanada,2008-01-07 14:02:00,7971,Great report Snag!  So this was the secret lure you would never show me when we fished together....thanks for not sharing it til now!  They look awesome...and they sure do seem to work well!
148715,Greencoachdog,2008-01-07 14:18:00,8163,"  You'll think ""over me"" when the breach of contract papers hit you in the butt!!!  Say good-bye to all of your fishin' tackle!!!"
148745,mepps,2008-01-07 16:28:00,1301,Nice job Grant!  Thanks for being my lure tester! I'll have to get some new lures out to you in time for spring pike!
