148812,carll2,2008-01-07 21:46:00,443,"hey guys.. i havent been around the board much in the past 8 months  but i still stop by from time to time to check ou reports and what not. last winter i got a job offer to work in northern quebec as a fishing guide(eyes and pike). now i decided to make a 3 part report in 3 different sections(equipment,construstion,fish pics) and id just like to say if you have a problem with some of the pictures please message me privately instead of spoiling the report. thank you and enjoy  it all started for me may 12th, the ice had just gone down and i got the call from my boss to start work asap. may was nice sunny and warm. june july and august were all crap with numerous cold fronts blowing in weekly spoiling the fishing, i fished 110 days straight and was i finally glad to finish at the end of september. anyways enought poop chat heres some pics and heres some info and history i found on the net about the reservoir.    The Gouin Reservoir (in French: Réservoir Gouin) is a man-made lake in the central portion of the Canadian province of Quebec. It is not one contiguous body of water, but the collective name for a series of connected lakes separated by innumerable bays, peninsulas, and islands with highly irregular shapes. It has therefore a relative long shoreline of over 5,600 km (excluding islands) compared to its surface area of 1,570 km².[1] It is the source of the Saint-Maurice River.  The reservoir is named after Jean Lomer Gouin, who was Premier of Quebec when, in 1918, the Shawinigan, Water & Power Company impounded the reservoir for hydroelectric development.[2] The Gouin Reservoir has no generating station at its dam, but is used to control the flow of the St-Maurice River for the stations down-stream (all operated now by Hydro-Québec).[3]  There are no paved roads to the Gouin Reservoir, but it is accessible by several unpaved forest roads and by bush plane. The reservoir is a popular fishing destination with numerous commercial outfitters and private lodges along its shores.   heres a map  of this huge body of water, and yes its very easy to get lost in the mazes of sandbanks and islands.     first things first, since were 20 miles away from any road on a sand island we need transportation, so we can bring our clients from the dock - the outfitter. this was my job, id pick up clints till about lunch time then guide till dark. heres my big baby 26 feet and 230hp(not enough sometimes lol)   crazy how much each motor is worth   and of course when we recieve clints have a little atv to carry all the luggage too and from the boat right to the chalet doors   my little tinny for when i only had 1-2 clients, atleast she had a 25hp    and then heres my big gun i would use with big groups,i find it easyier to guide with the small tinny   then of course we need to stalk up on supplies for the season so we bring on the ""barge""    then my bosses float planes he has(2) he brought me for a ride in one and wow what a feeling,i cant wait for next year.    that about does it for this part...the best part will be in the end  , yes i know you alll have to wait. il get to it sometime this week after im done sledding  enjoy"
