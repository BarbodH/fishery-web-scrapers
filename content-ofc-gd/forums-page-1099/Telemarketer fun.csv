Me: I'm not buying anything, interested in any polls or doing a survey! Telemarketer: Oh no, I am not selling anything, I am wondering if you are interested in free travel? Me: No, but you must own a house right? Telemarketer: No I do not own a house, are you interested in a free vacation? (Stumbling with her heavily accented words being taken totally off guard.) Me: Then you have to know someone who owns a house? Telemarketer: No I don't know anyone with a house. Me: You must know someone with a house. Everyone knows someone with a house. The person you know with a house has to need new windows right. New doors then right. You tell me and I will sell them some new windows OK. Telemarketer: Silence, a dead line.    I was so happy. Instead of me hanging up this time it was her!"

In the end I told her to say bye and she said ""bye bye"" last words I heard from him was ""what""...lol"
