148686,gone_fishin,2008-01-07 12:27:00,481,"well, it's a big lake, where are you planning to go?"
148687,Gerritt,2008-01-07 12:31:00,6129,3 deaths in less then 2 weeks? I think I will be staying off the ice for a bit...
148693,Vanselena,2008-01-07 13:01:00,269,"Stay off the ice until this warm spell passes. With above zero temps now forcasted for the next 48 hours it is likely we will lose about 5"" of ice, the rest will become soft."

148705,Hookset,2008-01-07 13:57:00,367,"Went out from Beaverton on Sunday. 6"" of good ice but it was melting up pretty fast. Went out with a hut operator (Hales). We were probably only half a mile out from shore. By the end of the day it was one big puddle. If the weather stays the same I'd expect it to deteriorate quickly. Check with hut operators if you want the real info. instead of trying to guess. The best ice conditions always come from the operators who are out there every day.   Hookset.   P.S. - The Perch were on fire"
