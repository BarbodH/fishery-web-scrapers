Memories will always be their, cherish them and especially the last days together....I know Kareem and his family appreciate the friendship you guys shared....  Our Condolences Lorissa and husband"

148929,Joey,2008-01-08 03:51:00,9122,I am truely sorry for your loss Mike.  I read all of your reports of fishing with Kareem and remember he was getting weaker and weaker.  Very sad and my thoughts are with you.  Joey
148241,solopaddler,2008-01-05 20:07:00,8605,"Many of my fellow board members here were aware of the ongoing situation with the health of my close friend Kareem. A lot of you guys have continued to show support through pm's and emails and for that I thank you.  Unfortunately Kareem passed away yesterday. He fought bravely right to the end, and as he's always been, he was a great inspiration to me.  In this world there were 3 people who I could count on for anything, no questions asked. My dad, my uncle, and Kareem. He was a true friend and I'm going to miss him a whole lot.  Kareem loved walleye fishing and was an absolute master of the sport. Over the last 18 years we spent literally hundreds of hours fishing together including a whole slew of fly in trips.  The quality of these pic's are not great as I don't have a scanner, but here's a few moments from better times:          I love you buddy, you won't be forgotten.  "
