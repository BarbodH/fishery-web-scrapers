148898,Ramble,2008-01-08 02:03:00,713,Excellent Fish and great report...keep them coming
148908,Rattletrap2,2008-01-08 02:32:00,1652,"Nice fish! I agree with Rizzo, they do look like Peacock Bass!"
148909,Beans,2008-01-08 02:35:00,3339,I read on a couple of other sites that Harry's in Keswick is selling minnows @$5 a scoop and Casey's in Port Bolster also has minnows...  Our friend Peter of Ice Cabins has his Bait Shack just off shore at Gilford as does Terry Goy...   BTW...congrats again Joey...you rock girl !!!  There may be a method to Paul's madness in not buying her a floater suit...if she keeps outfishing him...he may stuff her down a hole...
148915,Terry,2008-01-08 03:03:00,14456,"I went to Harry's in keswick one morning lately and he was closed, so I would trust him for anything anymore nothing like expecting to pick up supplies while helping the local businesses and the sucker is closed..nope no more money from me"
148610,Joey,2008-01-07 01:20:00,9122,"We headed out in the fog this morning, with the WeatherChannel threatening rain (Wrong again, what a surprise).  We were to meet Terry at 8 a.m. at the launch.  As we turned from Ravenshoe Rd. onto 48 the truck in front of us turned out to be Terry.  Good timing or what.  We all pulled into the bait shop on 48, Captain Morbid's.  What an experience that was.  This place, from the outside, looks like a biker shop.  Inside was Mr. Morbid   , a long haired biker wannabe/you mean its not the 60's hippie.  He talked up quite a storm, in the meantime charging us $12 per scoop of minnows.  For sale in the store he had biker clothes, heavy metal shirts, drug paraphenalia, jewellery, incense, food, knick knacks you'd find in your grandmother's house, expensive shoes and designer clothes.  The tank top I fancied, he informed me, was $79     I just wondered the rest of the day who, that would pay the kind of money he wanted for designer clothes, would actually be enticed into the store in the first place.  Yes, I'll have Chanel handbag and a bag of minnows please, with air  Anyhow, on to the fishing.  It was pretty much a slush pile that turned into bigger puddles as the day went by, but there was at least 12 inches of ice and people driving cars, vans and trucks out all day long.  Terry getting ready for the bite.    Paul actually caught a fish this time, on Simcoe.  It was a day for the record books    We caught a few dinks and I lost a big one at the hole, then Terry reeled in this monster.  It was about 14 inches.      Then I finally got a big one too, came in just over 14 inches and my PB Perch, (sorry Terry)    Didn't really keep count of how many fish we caught, but we kept the two monsters and 3 medium to small ones.  Good for a nice snack.  Thanks again for your company Terry, I had a really good time.  Can't wait for laker and whitie ice  Joey"

I don't believe the price this guy's chargin' for minnows . . . .    is he the ONLY place up there? How about Harry's in Keswick on the way up? He ALWAYS gives a GOOD scoop, was $3.50 last year? Or anybody down in Scarberia . . . .    LUCKY'S . . . .   (Midland & Sheppard) $3.00 will getcha a WEEK'S supply of emeralds, and he has all the basic gear you need, pretty reasonably priced. But . . . .    I JUST GOTTA get a shot at some of those MONSTER fish . . . .    w'at the secret Joey? How do ya do it?"
