148434,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-06 13:15:00,1362,"I just found a place 3 hrs north from here....chalet style cabins, ice huts, HOT TUB  and the lake has Brookies and Walleye...   My son, son-in-law and I have planned our 2nd annual ice fishing weekend for Jan 25 - 27th...I called the lodge yesterday and was advised that the lake is still open and they haven't put any ice huts out yet...they also said that they were not very optimistic with the ice conditions for the weekend that we booked if they go by the extended weather forecast  We can't change the dates now because my son-in-law already bought his ticket to fly up here from Atlanta...  Does anyone have any recommendations??   We are looking for a 2 bedroom cottage with a heated ice shack and originally were targeting Lakers, Whitefish and Walleye....We would really like to stay within a 3hr drive from Ottawa if possible....  Thanks, Steve"

148877,Mike the Pike,2008-01-08 01:06:00,3421, Well I would go with the mekoos place .I have stayed at Fontbrune before in May of 2002.4 days of fishing not a sniff.  The cabins are not that nice the stove we had kept on blowing fuses you know the old round glass fuses.The hide a bed looked and felt like it came from world war 1 .These were new owners so maybe they fixed it up since then but I am not going back.MTP
