Watched hundreds of perch move in that we could not see in the hole in 22ft. of water. A 5lb. bass and a 20 lb. laker swam past with no bite. Kept 2 jumbos for dinner.A great day on the ice!"

148816,Terry,2008-01-07 21:52:00,14456,they sure are fun I spend a lot of time just looking around with my aquavu
148818,fishermccann,2008-01-07 21:53:00,655,The quad 360 has 4 cameras so I saw the fish coming and going and in relation to the perch and a log in our viewing area! 20 and 5 were just guesses but I have been fishing and catching(weighing) for more than 40 years and those guesses were close!
148819,Beats,2008-01-07 21:53:00,543,"That's cool that you saw a bass and laker as well.   As cool as it is to see fish you wouldn't normally think were under your hole, I often wonder how much more frustration the camera adds when you can see a bass or laker there and can't get them to bite.  I'm sure some people would see these fish on their camera and spend way too much time trying to catch a fish that really isn't interested and not spend enough time on the perch that are more easily caught."
148822,fishermccann,2008-01-07 21:56:00,655,Yes I must admit that I spent to much time looking at the t.v. but I do the same thing with my graph in the summer.
