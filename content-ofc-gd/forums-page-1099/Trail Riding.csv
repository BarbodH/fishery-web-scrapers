148370,Dondorfish,2008-01-06 03:49:00,1000,"Well Skeeter, his wife Kelly, and myself decided that instead of hitting the lake, we would grab the sleds and head for the trails ( only my 2nd time ever on the trails ). We decided to check out Ganaraska Forest - so off we went. We unloaded the sleds where the 115 and the 35 split and headed east to Bewdley. I can honestly say that I completely enjoyed myself and will definately be going back! Other then the odd snowmobile coming by - the peace and quiet can only be compared to being out on the ice by yourself. Just thought some of you that have never been on the trails would like to see what your missing.   Don   More  pictures to follow"

I rode a snowmobile for the first time a few years ago, they're a blast!!! Glad we don't have them down here, might cut into my fishin' time!"

148412,lew,2008-01-06 10:55:00,12767,"Good to hear you enjoyed your day in the Ganaraska Don, it's a great spot 12 months of the year for alot of different activities.  A group of us spent many winters  riding the trails up in the Bancroft / Haliburton areas and it's an incredible  way to spend a winter weekend !!  And your right about the fellas that groom the trails , they do a great job and certainly makes it worthwhile paying for the yearly trail passes."
148540,skeeter,2008-01-06 20:44:00,1907,yes we had a blast on the trails. problem is my wife enjoyed it way to much. now she wants a better snow suit. a new helmet. new and warmer boots and gloves. next year she will want her own sled.   Dann
148543,skeeter,2008-01-06 21:19:00,1907,Thanks guys  i had a real good time on the trails yesterday. i can't wait to go ice fishing so i can show Don how to catch some big fish! hope to soon be on the lake  and meet some new friends.   Skeeters wife Kelly
148624,carll2,2008-01-07 01:45:00,443,"awesome pics guys..i spent all weekend riding and playing in the powder filled fields, i had to take advantage of the great conditions before the rain ruins eveything"

148631,Sinker,2008-01-07 02:05:00,8692,"You should come out here when the trails are really good. I live 5 mins from where you guys unloaded....prolly drove right by ya's on my way to go fishing  The ganny is great because its central. You can go east to bewdley, or west to port perry. Both rides are about the same distance. I like to go the port perry route....just because I can check out the lake while I'm there.  Sinker"
148648,Dondorfish,2008-01-07 02:42:00,1000,"  Not exactly sure what your trying to say Doug - but the peace and quite that I refer to would be similar to the peace and quite that I feel when I am out on a lake , in the boat, and someone goes by with a 2 stroke outboard - its still peace and quiet just the same.  Don"
148649,skeeter,2008-01-07 02:46:00,1907,  did anyone say that they were 2 stokes and not 4 stroke?? besides my oil smells like strawberrys when it is exhausted   Skeeter
148805,lew,2008-01-07 21:07:00,12767," Exactly what happened to me.  Years ago I was just riding an old junker and my wife wanted nothing to do with it. Finally I decided to upgrade and bought myself Ski-doo's 25th anniversary model and once she saw how nice that was, I couldn't keep her off of it and the only way I could get it back was to go out and buy her a new machine too  I must admit though, it made the weekend trips alot more fun with the Mrs coming along too"
148829,ecmilley,2008-01-07 22:16:00,2163,"yes rode lots of times in the ganny, usually has nice trails, though it looks to be all done in for the next week or so. If you ever wanna hook up for a ride shoot me a pm, from where i live takes me about 1 .5 hours to get the the tims on the 35/115 or take you on a tour of the bobcaygeon/ paudash trails"
148860,douG,2008-01-08 00:25:00,2693,"Rightly and properly slapped, my bad.  Not my choice, but not my business.  Never did the yellow snow thingy, tho, any suggestions?"
148930,Dondorfish,2008-01-08 03:52:00,1000,"   just might take you up on that offer ecmilley - Bobcaygeon and Buckhorn are on our ""trails to hit"" list - bet its some beautiful countryside. I'll let you know when we are heading up that way - maybe our schedules will work out.  Thanks Again   Don"
