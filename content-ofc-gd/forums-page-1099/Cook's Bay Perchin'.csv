148271,Skud,2008-01-05 21:17:00,739,Went out with two of the kids and started fishing at about 8:30am out from Gilford.  The bite was good for an hour or so but then died completly.  About 40 fish were landed but only 12 keepers(barely).  Moved around but could not locate more schools.  Fished 18-22 fow and just jigged small spoons.

We started out in 15 ft, first thing in the morning and moved out about two hundred yards at a time, looking for the schools. They were there, just not a much as first light. Ended up in 30 -35 ft by mid afternoon and the bite was steady but not overwhelming. I believe that's the key to Cook's. Start shallow and work your way out to deeper water as the day progresses.
