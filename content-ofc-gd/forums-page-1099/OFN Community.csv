148857,douG,2008-01-08 00:13:00,2693,"Wow!  I've met HH a coupla times, and he impresses with many talents, including a fine palate for great chili.  Good Luck,  HT HM, hope you like what is offered."
148858,Steve,2008-01-08 00:18:00,2075,"HH also helped me big time when going for my first (and current) job.  I had spent a few too many years in school, and my interview skills needed a big lift.  I was given some great interview tips, and one great ""kicker"" question to ask.  Needless to say, i got the FIRST job i was interviewed for, after his suggestions.  HH, THANKS AGAIN MAN!"
148874,Gerritt,2008-01-08 00:56:00,6129,"HH is probably one of the finest people you will ever meet... I have been helped ""professionally"" by him and have fished with him.... He truly is one of the Gems on this board... He is very selfless of himself and very honest person to boot...  I consider Joe a good friend, He is also a great father and husband as is evident by his family.... I wish I knew more people like him to be honest..  He helped me out when I was looking for a shift in careers as well... from construction... to Construction Management...  He gives solid advice and asks nothing in return... Well except for maybe a fishing partner, and that you be honest, natural and be the ""greasy wheel""  There are alot of great people on this board, People that give of themselves and ask for little or nothing in return... I can think of a whole slew of names  I am glad you can experience that Hometownhandyman.. and appreciate the hand that has been held out before you..  I wish you all the best!  Joe, Good on yah, Seeya in Killarney  Gerritt."
148931,irishfield,2008-01-08 03:54:00,26272,Absolutely GREAT guy.... but he still can't catch a fish!  
148955,Big Cliff,2008-01-08 10:13:00,6899,Good luck in that interview today!  HH is one of the reasons that this board is so wonderful to be a part of.
148960,motv8tr,2008-01-08 10:30:00,2587,"This comes as no surprise to me at all, we've got a great bunch of folks here...might even have to give HH a call myself and work on my interview skills  Good luck today HHH  Maureen"
148967,misfish,2008-01-08 11:00:00,29133,Good on ya HH and good luck with the interview.   Im not even going to ask what the heck that guy is doing on the bow  
148984,mcallister.grant,2008-01-08 12:49:00,327,Good luck on your intereview!!! Ask lots of questions!!!
148999,Headhunter,2008-01-08 14:20:00,5703,"Thanks for the kind words everyone!     I get way more back from the people here then I'll ever be able to pay back! Misfish, that's Terry doing some ""wormin"" at the front of the boat! Didn't help with the fishin though! Gerritt, let's do some ice fishin before we get up to Killarney! Hometownhandy man, best of luck in your interview, I hope the job is what you are seeking. A word to the ""lurkers"" out there. This group will amaze you, if you put yourself out there! If your sitting on the fence trying to decide whether or not to join up, you be paid back in spades for any and all actions you take to help out fellow board members... some food for thought! HH"
149007,Terry,2008-01-08 14:40:00,14456,"you're a good man  but as I remember I wasn't the only one worming, if that's the new catch phrase    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3194.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3194.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3195.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3195.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>      LOL   ."

149122,Gerritt,2008-01-08 22:48:00,6129,I know for FACT HH cant worm on a boat! LOL   :dunno:
149125,irishfield,2008-01-08 23:00:00,26272,We lent him an extension pipe and he was good to go Gerritt!
149140,icefisherman,2008-01-08 23:54:00,952,"I certainly can add few good words about Joe. Though he could not help me directly (different area of expertise), he did go out of his way to help me out with valuable advice.  So, cheers to Joe and all thanks to his kind efforts!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
149157,HTHM,2008-01-09 00:59:00,4082,"Well, I am just back from the big smoke.....and it turns out that I am not suited for this paticular job. Better to find out now from one's self rather than from someone else. So the search continues... One more ""no"" gone untill the yes. Thanks for all the encouragement!"
149167,mepps,2008-01-09 01:23:00,1301,Nice!  He helpde me out when I was in Ontario too.
149273,fishnsled,2008-01-09 16:54:00,3520,Good on you HH.  I hope things went well with the interview.
