I promised him that as soon as weather permitted and the ice was safe we would go. Well today was the day, up at 730 he was and raring to go I tell ya     With no fear at all he was on the ice relaxing and being a kid he found black ice so much fun, staring down onto it to see the bottom    but after a while he got rather comfortable at it and started to fish in earnest, schooling his dad big time     I fish a ton over the course of a year but any time I can get out with one of the kids I swear Im in heaven.  Given the bit of health concerns I have that lead to me having to quite smoking I found today even more rewarding.     It wasa tough bite over 16 fow but once we moved over 30 feet it was game on with waves of schools on a timer, which was fantastic for my son and awsome to see him on fish     as he knows its our Christmas eve Tomm night and a fish fry is a traditional event he wanted to make sure he had dinner taken care of...    I honestly believe this kid of mine will be a bass dude check out the hold, classic bass hold LOL    Any how dont want it to be an overly long post, but suffice to say hearing my son tell his mom "" it was the best day of his life"" made it well worth it    thanks for reading"

Funny thing when my son was looking at the picstures with me ( on the WII, actually pretty cool you can insert an sd card and watch it over the tv) he was commenting on the color of the gloves, funny hearing a small boy talk about his dislike for pink gloves LOL"
