148572,fishindevil,2008-01-06 22:53:00,6254,"Nice report,and cool pics as well !!!.  ..and that ice is plenty safe,it looks like about 4-5 inches in the auger shot,man thats tons of ice to be walking on,im not suicidal,or stupid and have been on the ice since i was a kid,and thats lots to be on,and its good clear solid ice too,and you did it right by even spudding your way out,and you had spikes and a float suit,so you are good to go,thanks for the report ....cheers"
148644,Sebastian,2008-01-07 02:35:00,208,"Nice fish. They obviously know the risks of going on the ice. The ice thickness/person or snowmobile chart isnt really that accurate because some of us are 150lbs and others are 400lbs. I rather go on 2"" of ice than park my car next to 20 other cars with 12"" of ice. Everyones got their limit of ice thickness they'll go on or the height of waves on a lake. I dont think you guys should attack them for posting their report. My 2 cents...."
148699,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-07 13:32:00,0,  Was out yesterday as well  Chev. Ice was getting soft under foot. We to had 4 plus iches of black ice with a bit of pack ice in between. We caught Trout and tons of Herring. I won't be out till it gets cold again. The rain is killing the little ice we had. Ah well............  .... looks like maybe the end of Jan for good safe ice but always keep an eye for changing conditions  Looks worse than it was but still...DONT GO IF YOU DONT KNOW!.....  
148757,Tacklebuster,2008-01-07 17:28:00,303,"I am by all means not a pro with only several ice fishing trips under my belt and those were with outfitters.  Nonetheless, based on my first impression as soon as I read the title of whitefish on Simcoe, and then having read many of the same opinions, I can't help myself and contribute my own opinion.   For the life of me I can't understand how important it is to go out there to catch a fish when the ice conditions are poor enough that in a matter of a couple of weeks 2 lives plus possibly another have been lost.   Clearly, these guys thought it was risky enough for them to tie a rope between them...""just in case"" = exteme foolishness.   IMO its these kind of reports may encourage others to do the same, which will inevitably lead to another report...but this one will be in the news.   These guys may have the experience to take the precautionary messures they did, unfortunately their experience didn't tell them to fish where the ice conditions were more favourable....hmmmmmmmmm 2-4"" of ice, or 8-12"" of ice, its not that tough a decision."
148776,Puckhead,2008-01-07 19:32:00,377,"By taking the precautions that you did, your experience told you that the ice was dangerous.  If you are strapping a rope from one guy to the other, because the ice is too thin – get off the ice.  Glad some of you caught some fish, but man, is it really worth it guys???  I mean seriously, in the grand scheme of life, it's a fish...    I’m glad most people see this trip as being foolish, I know I won’t be reading a report about you in the newspaper in the future…  As for some of you other guys – be safe, the fish will be there tomorrow…"
148778,Puckhead,2008-01-07 19:36:00,377," That's the problem...  9 out of 10 times it's always the ""experienced"" guy that we read about.  Rarely have I seen a news report on some dope that didn't know what he was doing, it's always the guy that's been out there 10000 times.  Experience can work against you, especially when dealing with mother nature..."
148801,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-07 20:53:00,0,Who is experienced?  I just go where I know.    Its not everyones thing..... I know that going on the ice today is another story which you may very well read about in the paper!!...
148802,Terry,2008-01-07 20:55:00,14456,I will lend you my folding boat
148803,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-07 20:57:00,0,  There's STILL WAY TO MUCH ICE!!!..........but hey....it would slide real good out there..  Thanks
148806,Terry,2008-01-07 21:12:00,14456,I'm hooking up a 100cc motor and a fan...a folding air boat now that's the ticket
148811,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-07 21:37:00,0,Folding airboat?   We use a fan to hunt for carp...    ... You may have something there..
148824,rhare,2008-01-07 21:58:00,387,"  Exactly, everyone has there limits. Congrats on the trout GB, makes it worth while.     Not looking good for Simcoe for the next couple weeks. Everyone be safe and never go out alone!"
148827,Sinker,2008-01-07 22:11:00,8692,"Is it just me, or does it seem like the guys who go out on the ice once or twice a season are the ones whining about your report? You know....the guys who need at least a foot of ice before they consider it ""safe"".  I get it all the time too.....""OMG.....you were out on the ice?"" Meanwhile there is 6"" of clear black ice......they just don't know.  Please people, if you haven't been there for yourself, you can't judge these guys actions. They obviously know what they're doing, and made it back to shore with no probs....and a nice whitie to boot! They took extra precautions just in case......Solid clear ice like that is strong stuff.........and don't forget.....IT FLOATS!!  Thanks for the report!!  Sinker"
148837,Puckhead,2008-01-07 22:40:00,377," Sorry Sinker - It's not wining, Troutguy knows his ice and he felt that, although it wasn't safe ice, he was confident enough in his experience to be out on it...  Take from that as you will..."
148840,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-07 23:03:00,0,Troutguy. Maybe you might want to explain to puckhead that the ice you were on was good. It was the deep water area of ice on the main lake you were saying that was unsafe. Hope that helps some.
148862,rhare,2008-01-08 00:29:00,387,"    Your right its the guy who has been fishing 10000 times, BUT take no precautions ie: no floatsuit, no chipper, no picks, no rope, no friend its all relative. Sometimes experience has nothing to do with it.   The ice on kemp was froze right across as far as you could see, its not the main lake. JP side is a whole different story, there is still open water out in the main lake. I fish where I know."
148398,rhare,2008-01-06 05:10:00,387,"Well my buddy Dan and I headed out for a hour today on a little bay in kemp. The ice was 2-4"" thick and inconsistant. We headed out packed light with the spikes out just incase. No one fishing but us in this area although I know more ppl where out. Dan managed to get a nice whitefish about 3.5lbs. We fished in 65fow, We marked a few more but no takers. all and all not a bad hour of fishing.  Chip chip step.  went through in about 6 pokes    Auger under some thin ice.   Dan fighting his fish   nice start to a good season.   The warm weather tomorrow could be hard on the ice, it will be more unstable as the day goes by so becareful everyone.   Ryan"
148401,douG,2008-01-06 06:02:00,2693,The auger pic  -----> Yoikes!  The meegs and BBs rock for the whities.  Thanks for the great pictures.
148413,medmart,2008-01-06 10:59:00,587,nice white fish but that ice is a little to thin for me play safe  rob
148415,Terry,2008-01-06 11:22:00,14456,"yeah, I was around that area friday and chickened out, I like a little more ice"
148416,Big Cliff,2008-01-06 11:54:00,6899,"2-4"" of ice and 65' of water? Not for this old man. Glad we're not reading about you in the papers this morning!"
148422,Photoz,2008-01-06 12:21:00,792,VERY nice fish . . . .    but isn't it just amazing how much the scales & scale pattern resemble another well-known fish? If the scales were just a bit bigger . . .     and the colour was slightly more bronze . . . .     presto neato . . .    a 'whistling trout?'

148441,Smokey,2008-01-06 13:42:00,1278,Nice fish. Congrats amd be careful out there.
148444,Mike the Pike,2008-01-06 13:47:00,3421,Ya you guys are extreme although you explored thin ice good to see you had the floater suits and spikes ready oh and I must say yikes also for the ice auger pic .Nice whitie but please be careful out there.
148448,Bassloadingzone,2008-01-06 14:17:00,32,"Just in case any younger people are reading this post and thinking, WELL THEY FISHED WITH 2 INCHES OF ICE, because they had floater suites and ice picks, heres the reality of how lucky these 2 fellows were, even with a floater suite, you have about five minutes to get your self out of the water, 2 inches of ice when useing a pick, jab at the ice it breaks, jab again it breaks, even if it were to hold, the wieght from you trying to pull yourself up on 2 inches of ice, the ice breaks.  SO PLEASE BE SMART,2 INCHES OF ICE ISNT ENOUGH to fish over 30ft of water.  I have a question, why is it when we hear about someone going threw the ice and hear it was 2 inches thick, most of the comments are about how stupit they were for being out there with that little ice, but when guys are lucky and make it back to shore we pat them on the shoulder like their a hero...   SORRY BUT I THINK THIS KIND OF THREAD SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO SAFTEY ON THE ICE< THE ONLY COMMENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN HERE WAS THE ONE TERRY MADE WHEN HE SAID HE WAS SMART ENOUGH NOT TO GO OUT ON 2 INCHES OF ICE"
148459,mistyriver1,2008-01-06 15:04:00,600,"Nice fish, but definitely not enough ice for my liking.  To each his own I guess."
148463,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-06 15:26:00,2585,glad we are reading your report and not your obituary.  play safe  cheers!
148464,bigfish1965,2008-01-06 15:30:00,3382,"This board and it's previous incarnations have never had a member die fishing. Please, keep that streak alive. Be careful. Glad you guys had a good outing, but the ice is not safe this week in many places. Leave it alone for a few weeks and it will all be good again."
148465,Whopper,2008-01-06 15:36:00,2174, I'm with Cliff on this one.

148467,rhare,2008-01-06 16:36:00,387,"By no way did I start this thred to make people think the ice was safe. I took the auger pic to show just how unsafe the ice is.  ICE ON DEEP WATER ON LAKE SIMCOE IS NOT SAFE, END OF STORY.  Simcoe is a big lake and has lots of areas that have current flowing under the ice. Many areas the ice is far too thin to walk on. This happend to be a place I was confident on. Its also not my first time ice fishing, and I know whats safe for me to walk on and whats not.  everyone please be safe out there, the ice is not the same today as it was yesterday."
148468,mistyjr1,2008-01-06 16:36:00,97,"Not enough ice for me I am a ""car or small pickup"" I guess if i follow Danbo's chart.  I myself 2"" or 2' i have my ice picks on my neck, if you go through what good are they gonna do for you if they are in your tackle bag??  Nice whitefish.  Corey"
148469,rhare,2008-01-06 16:38:00,387,"P.S the auger is under 5"" of ice, its just very clear"
148470,rhare,2008-01-06 16:41:00,387,"you wear em around your neck when you know you might go in, we also had 30' of rope in between us so if one guy went the other should be safe.      "
148473,mistyjr1,2008-01-06 16:58:00,97,"Yes but i wear my Life Jacket when ever i am in the boat... so why not my ice picks?  You said ""when you know you might go in"" when do you know?"
