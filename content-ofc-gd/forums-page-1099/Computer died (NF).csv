I knew it was coming cause the HD kept acting up, so most stuff was backed up. Will be a few days before I have everything up and running again. working from the laptop now so i can work on existing sites, but all my goodies for making new sites is toasted for now. Computer is going in for recovery and HD replacement tonite. At least i got three years out of this one"
148774,tonyb,2008-01-07 19:27:00,1637,"Computer crashes are the best lessons on backup strategy  Most people don't do any sort of backups...the fishing pictures alone on my computer are priceless, back up your important stuff folks!  Tony"
148781,Headhunter,2008-01-07 19:41:00,5703,"Toshiba announced today that they will begin selling a 500gig external drive that would do a nice job of backing up most peoples systems! Rick, is your HD still under warranty? If your not aware, it could be something worth checking out... save a few bucks. HH"
148790,Gerritt,2008-01-07 19:56:00,6129,time to get a solid state drive Rick.  G
148791,Terry,2008-01-07 19:57:00,14456,"I feel your pain..well maybe not quite  my desktop CPU died , 2 years and one month old and I can't get the part form the company that made them,  or from the place I bought it from  got a place in the states sending me one.....it's stuck at the border..seems they  don't want it in the country or something..still trying to figure out what is going on  but I just don't want to buy a  whole new computer yet"
148792,ccmtcanada,2008-01-07 20:08:00,7971,I've fried my share of computers in my day as well.  The best was when a power supply sent pretty blue sparks out of the case.  I've fried motherboards and hard drives as well.  It's a special talent of mine.
148794,highdrifter,2008-01-07 20:23:00,2534,"Oooh that's a major pain in the arse.  My sympathies to you Rick, or anyone who has had to go through with it.   It's like tossing a photo album in the fire, you won't get em back!  What about a partition??  I've still yet to figure it out...  I'm running on Vista Home Basic and had the blue screen of death the other day because I had turned off my computer accidentatly while symantec updates were being made.  I was able to retrieve pictures that I had saved since my last back up, but everything else was lost!  Do I need an IT background to do this?  I'm told it's pretty simple.  cheers HD"
148795,Chris,2008-01-07 20:23:00,405,"Hi, I just bought a 500G external drive, it was around $149 at Future Shop. It works just like a flash drive (memory stick) only you can set it to back up your hard drive at set times. Plugs right into the USB port....works excellent so far."
148830,HTHM,2008-01-07 22:17:00,4082,"Don't think of it as a lost computer........, but rather a new boat anchor.  I do sympathize, been there done that!"
148910,bigfish1965,2008-01-08 02:36:00,3382,we had a power outage the other day and I hooked up my UPS to the sump pump and just plugged the PC into the wall (dummy) and the power came on and off 4 times within a few seconds sending enough spikes to corrupt my entire systems32 folder. Told that a reformat should get me back. Hope so cause repair failed.
148976,Chris,2008-01-08 12:11:00,405," Hi, Clampet, Future Shop also had a 250G unit for around $100. That is all you need. I just recently upgraded to a faster computer and it has a 500G HD that's why I bought the 500G ext-drive. I will probably never fill it. My last computer had two 40G hd's and I was no where close to filling them."
148977,Chris,2008-01-08 12:13:00,405,"Oops, sorry Clampet, just noticed you were referring to your ram not your HD. Right click on your HD and it will tell you how big your HD is. That is what you will want to back up."
148979,Greencoachdog,2008-01-08 12:20:00,8163,After 3 yrs. it's time to upgrade again anyway!
148986,Big Cliff,2008-01-08 12:58:00,6899,"Mine started to act up a couple of months ago, I opened it up and found a layer of dust all over my CPU (Vaccuum cleaners should work so well) so I took the Vaccuum and a soft brush and cleaned it and it has been working perfectly ever since. I guess the CPU was just overheating, fortunatly it doesn't seem like there was any perminant damage."
