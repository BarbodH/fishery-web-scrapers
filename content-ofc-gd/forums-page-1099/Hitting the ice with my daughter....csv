Only caught 8 but they were spaced out over the couple hours we were there so it kept her occupied.  He are some pics and a video of our excursion....  Here she is clearing the hole so she can haul the big ones through...   Here is her prefered method of icefishing, very relaxed....   Her method works!!  First fish of the day...   Proud fishergirl...   Another... happy girl:   A short video of her hauling a monster through the hole.....   Just a great day!!  Burt"
