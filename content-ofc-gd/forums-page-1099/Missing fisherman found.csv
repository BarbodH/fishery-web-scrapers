Common sense has become a very limited commodity these days! HH"

149319,JFR,2008-01-09 20:33:00,498,"My condolences to his family, it is such a tragic loss.  What I read and heard on the news was that his body was found ON the ICE, a short distance from land.  It would appear that the man may have suffered a heart attach, and being in foggy conditions was disoriented.  What a sad and tragic way to end life.  John"
