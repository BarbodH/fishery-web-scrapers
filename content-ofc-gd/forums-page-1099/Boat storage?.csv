149286,Dr. Hook,2008-01-09 18:20:00,18,"HI folks, Just wondering what people generally charge for boat storage. I got my first boat a few weeks ago (16' starcraft bowrider) and I have no room to keep it. I'd like to keep it somewhere I can drive in and get it any time of the day or night with no hassles, and need year round storage. If you are in the Alliston/ Barrie area, have some space and could use a few extra bucks let me know. thanks"
