147960,007,2008-01-04 17:26:00,537,"It's a bit late but Happy New Year to all of you back in the frozen north that is Canada, from 007 back in London, England.  Looks like you are having a good ice fishing season and look forward to seeing more reports throughout the Winter.  Unfortunately I can't seem to view the photos in the posts from work but hopefully I will get an internet connection at home soon so I can see all that ice action and see what I'm missing out on.  Unfortunately I haven't had chance to cast a line back here in England yet but hope to soon once I've settled and found some water that I'm either allowed to fish or can afford to pay the day/season ticket (in addition to the licence) to fish!   When I do I will be sure to post a detailed report for you to enjoy.  Anyhow just thought I would say hi.  Stay safe out on the ice this weekend.  007"

148017,Beans,2008-01-04 21:57:00,3339," Or the cost of joining a carp club and paying ""swim"" fees...just like golf ""green"" fees...We got it good in this country..."
148075,motv8tr,2008-01-05 02:21:00,2587,Welcome back! and Happy New Year to you too   Glad you settled in and I hope you're able to go fishing soon so we can see your reports  Maureen
148170,Rich Clemens,2008-01-05 14:25:00,3131,Welcome back Mr. Bond.  I'm sure you were out saving the world since you were last on here ... THANK YOU.   I know we have a couple other members on the board from over your way.  May be pretty neat if you all could hook up sometime.
148447,Mike the Pike,2008-01-06 14:14:00,3421,Welcome back Gavin we sure miss your reports here.Please keep in touch.When will you be back in Canada again?  
148700,007,2008-01-07 13:40:00,537,Thanks for the comments guys n gals.  Mike the Pike - I'll be back as soon as it warms up over there! LOL  No plans yet to come back unfortunately.  I'm really going to miss it when I start seeing the first reports from T.O like SNAG's Pike reports and dsn's carp reports in Spring!  Rich Clemens - that's a good idea but not sure where we're all based  'Musky or Specs' and Beans - You don't know how lucky you are over there.  Over here you buy a licence but then for each body of water you need to check if it is free public fishing or more likely that the lake or access to a stretch of river is owned by someone and therefore you have to either pay a day ticket to fish or join a club and pay their annual fee.  Some of the clubs that have access to the lakes with the biggest or best fishing are seriously expensive.  Cheers 007
148709,ccmtcanada,2008-01-07 14:04:00,7971,Good to hear from you again 007!  Glad to see you made it back and are getting set up.  Hope to see some reports from you from across the pond.  We are indeed very fortunate to have the fishery we have here in Canada.  Hope you had a great holiday and I wish you a very happy and healthy new year.
