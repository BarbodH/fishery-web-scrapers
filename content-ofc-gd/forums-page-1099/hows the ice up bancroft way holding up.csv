149109,Photoz,2008-01-08 22:15:00,792,"On Saturday (just as this started) there was about 4""  -  5"" of good black ice, and another 5"" of pretty solid white ice on top, at Jacks Lake. I suspect that white ice will turn to slop pretty quick . . . .   but I highly doubt it'll hurt the good ice much? By Thursday it's gonna be back below zero, and next week, back well under zero!"
