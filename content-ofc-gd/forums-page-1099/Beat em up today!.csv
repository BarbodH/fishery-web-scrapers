Didnt matter what I dropped down the hole, they ate it.  Depth was about 20 feet.  No real monsters, 2- twelve inchers, nice fish ... most were 8-9 inches.  Good keeper size for a starving college student"

Easy for me, not others, I had a huge prob with my camera cable that's why I did it this way.  Camera's are a pain sometimes."

148712,Headhunter,2008-01-07 14:06:00,5703,"We had a similar experience on Saturday out of Keswick. Started fishin in 15 ft and they were nailing everything we dropped. Action slowed down shallow by 9:00am, we simply moved out to deeper water as the day went on. Ended the day in about 25 to 30 ft. Kept a dozen, probably caught 75 by the time I had to leave at 2:30pm. Jiggin Raps and dropper rigs worked well, very light bites and a tasty meal for my family and the visiting in-laws on Sunday! No minnows were harmed in catching any perch! 6 inches of good ice out of Keswick on Saturday morning, wouldn't bet on that being the case today! HH"
148713,Beats,2008-01-07 14:09:00,543,"  Wow, not too many people can say that."
148735,Headhunter,2008-01-07 15:47:00,5703,"It's been my experience on Simcoe that minnows only slow you down! If the perch are under your ice hole (take your shot!) they will bite. You need to get the bait to them quickly as the school travels by and minnows just take too long between fish. A jiggin rap, I like blue and silver, fire tiger as well, with two power grubs hooked onto the bottom treble and your in fine shape. HH"
