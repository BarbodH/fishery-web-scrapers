""We're sorry sir, but we have some information about your wife,"" said one Mountie. ""Tell me! Did you find her?"" the husband shouted. The Mounties looked at each other. One said, ""We have some bad news, some good news, and some really great news. Which do you want to hear first?"" Fearing the worst, the ashen husband said, ""Give me the bad news first."" The Mountie said, ""I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but this morning we found your wife's body in the bay."" ""Oh my God!"" exclaimed the husband. Swallowing hard, he asked, ""What's the> good news?"" The Mountie continued, ""When we pulled her up, she had 12 twenty-five pound snow crabs and 6 good-size lobsters clinging to her."" Stunned, the husband demanded, ""If that's the good news, what's the great news?"" The Mountie said, ""We're going to pull her up again tomorrow."""
