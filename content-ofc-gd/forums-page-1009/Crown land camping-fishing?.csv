I know it's very last minute planning considering that it is the Canada day weekend ... have checked out quite a few provincial parks and they're fully booked. Does anyone know of anywhere there's crown land I can camp on? Or other privately owned campground which might have availability? We don't need a serviced campground. This trip will be more focused on fishing so the campground is just a place to stay for the night, it would be nice to be right next to the water or at least very close water access. I'll be bringing my 14' tinny. Since we're only going for one night, I'm hoping to drive no more than 2 hours, trying to maximize time on the water.  I have seen many small islands while out on a few kawartha lakes, they don't seem to be privately owned ... can I camp on one of those? Does anyone have experience camping on one?  Thanks in advance, please PM me if you do not wish to put the information on here.  Victor"
