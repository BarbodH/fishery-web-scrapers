218353,aplumma,2008-06-23 12:58:00,6896,I had a great time and was happy to see all of the new and old faces again. I was also lucky enough to fish with Bill Parker for the contest and he managed a really respectable third in the fishin contest. I am convinced that if he doesnt listen to me and throw away the first two 20 and 22 inch fish he has a good shot at first place. Thanks to all the people and also to Lak Air and the staff it was another great week.   Art
218354,motv8tr,2008-06-23 12:59:00,2587,"  Thanks Chris, it was a nice Muskie, and loads of fun, but I can't post the pic as the board rules state no photo's of OOS fish....  Maureen"
