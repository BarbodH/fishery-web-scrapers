218900,cranks bait,2008-06-24 11:21:00,721,All the hype about the new lure that Dave Mercer was bring to BPS on the 22 and I cannot find anything on it.  Did anyone get one or see what it was?  Is it a Subway wrapper?  Just joking Dave.
218911,pikeguy2,2008-06-24 11:52:00,3,I have not seen anything yet but im sure it will be good
218915,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-24 12:12:00,3761,Is there a name for this bait?
218919,BillM,2008-06-24 12:18:00,17367, Cold Cut Trio  
218930,maybe,2008-06-24 13:00:00,307,I assume it's the one on the bottom of page 15 of the current Bass Pro flyer.
218948,kickingfrog,2008-06-24 13:53:00,8333,It might be a line of existing lures that are customized. Special colours/patterns and higher quality hooks. I'll be looking.
219010,Slayingm,2008-06-24 16:21:00,204,"My guess would be its the new X-Rap Sub-walk ..... its basically a suspending type fatter guide bait that you can 'walk-the-dog' under water.  Its a good lure for big Largies and smallies.  I am currently testing out some other newer colours and sizes of those baits along with some other new Rapala and Storm lure design's that we be available in 2009.  Some pretty exciting stuff.... especially for those who like to get out for Northern's and Musky.  Here is a link for info on the Sub-walk..... http ://www.rapala.com/products/luresdetail...oth&live=1  Regards, Greg."
219015,highdrifter,2008-06-24 16:36:00,2534,mmmmm.  thats love at first twitch.  cheers! HD
219026,marcers75,2008-06-24 17:08:00,36," Slayingm, you are correct with the new colour scheme for Mercer's Magic. 4 types of rapala  were created with this new colour: X-Rap 10 X-Rap shad 6 DT Flat 7 and I believe a DT Minnow  I got the Dt and X-Rap. Going to try them out this weekend."
219031,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-24 17:16:00,3761,Go to this site. This new lure is the second one to the right. Kind of cool video on it.  http://www.rapala.com/how2TV/  Also there is the bait if you want to buy: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults
219036,johnnyb,2008-06-24 17:31:00,3413,"Yup -- DT Minnow, which goes 7-11 feet, has a minnow-like profile with what they say is the wobble of a Shap Rap.  I grabbed one of these and the DT Flat 7 ...with coffin shaped lip, of course  Nice colour...the X-raps they had were too small for me to be tempted...although the colour looks very similar to the Olive that they already have.  It's unique shades and bright stripe stand out more on the DT Flat 7  Can't wait to try mine out!  Oh, and for those whoe are fans of the good ole' Tenessee Shad colour on their Shad Rap, it's back on that DT Minnow, 'cept it's called Bleeding Copper flash, or something.  Had to buy one....my old Shap Rap is starting to show it's age."
219054,TJQ,2008-06-24 18:31:00,7806,"I just talked to Dave... hes on the water for a few days, but will chime in when he gets back... the main point is that this is a colour scheme hes been airbrushing his lures with for years!"
