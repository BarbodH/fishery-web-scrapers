218163,solopaddler,2008-06-22 22:39:00,8605,"Okay I think I've got it now (youtube seems to be the way to go  )   This was a trip I did with my dad and uncle in June 2006. Hadn't even seen these clips 'till last week when my uncle found them on his camera and forwarded them to me. Taken with his digital camera they're very crude, but kind of interesting and a little funny at times  .  No talking on this one. My uncle's filming me dragging our boat up through a heavy set of rapids while my dad swats flies in the background:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0bHgIcSfSI   Please excuse the inane banter and the seemingly ridiculous amount of fish on the stringer (it was our 3 man limit):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yx-pwy1Ecs  My dad the comedian  :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awzVWadnFgw   Cheers,  Mike"
218232,Musky or Specks,2008-06-23 01:42:00,2710,They dont appear to be working for me.
218242,Mike the Pike,2008-06-23 01:59:00,3421,can't see anything here Mike.just get the link to photobucket thats it
218245,danc,2008-06-23 02:05:00,4677,Can't see them ether Mike. Is it really worth the cost to fly further than Nakina?
218249,Billy Bob,2008-06-23 02:08:00,5865,I can't access your video either.  Years ago I flew out of Nakina and the fishing was second to none. However it was on hell of a long drive to Nakina from the Buffalo area but we had 8 guys and a 40 ft motor home that made it nice.
218320,solopaddler,2008-06-23 10:04:00,8605," Okay I ""think"" they're working now. I checked before I posted and they worked for me (but then they worked for me last night as well  ).  Hey Dan, nope it's not worth the cost at all if your criteria is only catching fish. Plenty of amazing fishing to be had without flying in..."
218423,highdrifter,2008-06-23 15:25:00,2534,"Mike!  I'm sure the pics are awesome, but I can't seem to access them either.  Don't we need a membership to view anything on Photobucket?  Why not just post em off your OFC account dude?  Must.. have.. fish.. PPPOOORRNNNN  HD"
218558,solopaddler,2008-06-23 19:47:00,8605," Kinda lame fish porn, but nonetheless here ya go LOL!"
218569,Whopper,2008-06-23 20:01:00,2174,Good stuff Mike!
218574,Pachone,2008-06-23 20:18:00,276,Nice vids man!
218596,highdrifter,2008-06-23 21:23:00,2534,mmmmm yeah.  Now we're good.  That was very satisfying.  thanx HD
218599,danc,2008-06-23 21:33:00,4677,"Yes. Those were great Mike. And of course, flying in is the way to go. There's nothing like having an entire fish filled lake to yourself. Thanks for sharing."
218747,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:05:00,7971,"Great videos Mike!  I gotta tell you, in that first video, seeing you struggle with that boat while your dad was swatting flies and the cameraman just watching....LOL.  Did you, even for a second think ""A little help here guys??"" LOL.  Cant say that looks like fun Mike...to each their own I suppose....haha.  The other vids were entertaining as well....""Noooooo.....I dont wanna go back...."""
218757,solopaddler,2008-06-24 01:17:00,8605," You gotta understand both of those guys were pushing 70 at the time, and even if they wanted to help I wouldn't have let them anyway...  I've done stuff like that a million times, and 20 years from now it won't be the fishing I remember, it'll be dragging that bloody boat 1KM upstream by myself while being swarmed by blackflies LOL!  (On a side note we absolutely SLAYED the fish above those rapids, so it was definitely worth it. My dad caught a 29"" walleye which is a remarkable fish for that watershed)"
218762,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:20:00,7971," Ahhh...makes sense then Mike.  Ok...if I was with you, you'd have been saying ""Come on, put the damn camera away and get your butt over here you lazy, good for nothing.....""  At any rate, looked like a trip to remember!"
218773,solopaddler,2008-06-24 01:25:00,8605," That is correct sir!  (On a side note you're more than welcome to join me in Nakina late July, tentatively have a quickee trip on tap...)"
218780,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:29:00,7971," Wow...very tempting...but the budget wont allow it right now.  I do however, fit nicely in an oversized duffle bag.....a little food and drink and I can be luggage."
218783,solopaddler,2008-06-24 01:33:00,8605, Only cost is gas and food   .
218789,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:39:00,7971,"Send dates....I'll let you know quickly so you are not waiting in case you have someone else in mind too.  Work is hectic, but I may be able to swing some time off."
218808,solopaddler,2008-06-24 02:03:00,8605, Check your pm's bud.
218845,Moosebunk,2008-06-24 02:53:00,3970,"If Mike was on my turf I would have had him dragging my boat.  If I was on his, I would have had him dragging his and my boat. HAHA."
218856,solopaddler,2008-06-24 03:11:00,8605," Nope. The only way I'm dragging that behemoth of yours is if I juice myself up. I just saw ""The Man Who's Arms Exploded"" last night on A&E. Anything's possible I guess  .  If you were on my turf we'd use the behemoth to drag my more normal sized boat."
218871,scuro,2008-06-24 04:24:00,386,"You dad...I could listen to him all day...""what a humpback"". He has that old Euro view of the world and a slight accent. Where was he born?"
218880,solopaddler,2008-06-24 06:08:00,8605," That was my uncle behind the camera actually, but they're like 2 peas in a pod. I had completely forgotten that he'd called the bigger walleye humpbacks 'till I saw the video clip last week LOL!  They were born in a small town near Darmstadt."
218951,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-24 14:03:00,0,Great vids. Looks like you like to go the extra mile to catch those fish! Thanks for sharing.
