Geez cant see the pics so hope they posted correctly. headed down a little further and started trolling again  with shad rap and hooked into another small eye.  Casting and trolling in area gave up and headed further south and started to hooking into bass.  Hope I got these pics, because I cannot see a thing. Well headed out of that area ,and went across the lake ,looked good with so cabbage and rock shoals , stater trolling a point and hooked into another bas smallie,the started casting muskie killer bait on first cast , the hit happened in 3-4 fow.  Right off the bat I knew it was the elusive Ski I was looking for. . Dint want anything to do with that bait.and was trying ever thing to throw that lure.  Even at the boat when I thought i was tired ,nope time for another run.
