All equipment supplied.  All you have to do is get to Ottawa!!  PM me e-mail or call me for tickets folks...just a little over a month to go."

219167,muskymatt,2008-06-24 23:21:00,2608,"Yes I did get it...thanks  Hey guys and gals....  I know I'm not the most popular guy on OFC due to some of my reactions to some posts. But I can guarantee you that whoever wins the mini draw will be treated to 2 days of muskie hunting to be remembered.  You will not regret it. I guarantee that.  Let's do right for Big Jim , he deserves it for what he has done for fishing and the kids.  Thanks bigbuck sometime a little knudge is needed to get people off the bench!!"
