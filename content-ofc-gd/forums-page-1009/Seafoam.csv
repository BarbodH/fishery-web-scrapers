217360,Blue_Axela,2008-06-19 20:42:00,88,Try adjusting your carb at idle to smooth it out.
217366,Sinker,2008-06-19 21:17:00,8692,"Dont touch your carb until you run seafoam thru it!!! Decarbonize the motor, and I bet it runs great again.  I also use a product called power tuner. Its made by Mercury, and comes in a spray can. Just spray it in the intake while the engine is running until it stalls. Let it sit for an hour or so, then fire it up and watch all the crap that comes out! I run this stuff once a season in mine.  Sinker"
217458,oxcowboy,2008-06-20 02:18:00,544,"thanks for the input guys, think im gonna pick up a can and give it a try.  i dont guess it could hurt much and cheaper than taking it to  a shop some where.  thanks again  jason"
217468,Sinker,2008-06-20 02:39:00,8692,"CAn't hurt a thing. I think you'll be impressed. If it doesn't help the problem, its likely your carb.  Sinker"
218341,sully,2008-06-23 12:08:00,40,"I once had a problem with one of my dirt bikes running crappy, poured some Seafoam into it and it cleared right up. Now every year I run some thru each of the motors as preventative maintenance before I put 'em away for the winter....  amazing stuff...."
