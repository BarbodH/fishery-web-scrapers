218033,jwl,2008-06-22 16:32:00,1056,"not gonna touch on any brand names here, but are you going 8 to 9.9 because you don't want the worries of of registering the boat and insurance and such?  depending on the boat, you say it's a deep 14, you may want to go a bit bigger than a 9.9 for sure, lots of deepV 14's can take 25's even 30's on the back, some are heavy. I have a 14 foot ultralite model...it's rated for a 15 but I run a 9.9 on it...that's the smallest motor I would want on that boat...it pushes the boat around pretty nice and doesn't make it feel like it's underpowered, but we tested my bro-in-law's 6 on it before when he was fixing the motor up at it really lags, but in comparison, the boat I have the 9.9 on is all of about 250lbs before you load it up...if I had the extra cash to spend right now I would put a 15 on it....to me registering the boat isn't the issue, I already have a bigger boat registered and insured, it just happens that we had the 9.9 for years now that we used on 2 different boats so that's what I use on the newer one.   In comparison though, we had it on an older 14 footer steel boat and it really seemed to lag cuz of the weight of the boat, then we traded the 14 for a 12 footer aluminum and the 9.9 kicked butt on there, and then a few years back we got the 14 brand new just the boat no motor and been using the 9.9 on it ever since...sure I would love to have a brand new 15 for it, but I really can't justify putting a couple thousand dollar motor on a boat that you can buy brand new for 15 hundred....if I where to do that I may as well just buy a whole other boat package, but i don't think the wife would go for that   we already have 3 boats"
218066,issamhay,2008-06-22 18:28:00,77,"I dont mind if it runs a bit slow, I just need it to run cause I dont have alot of money to spend on the motor."
218072,glen,2008-06-22 18:44:00,2641,There should be some good used 2 stroke 9.9 hp around.  If you can spare $800 that would get a good runner.  Look in the supershopper.
218190,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-23 00:00:00,0,costco has a 9.9 merc 4 stroke for $849 not a bad price for a new motor
218200,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-23 00:19:00,2585, It may be tough to find a better deal then this one on a 4 stroke!  Cheers!
218222,pikehunter,2008-06-23 01:08:00,1659,"That's gotta be a misprint, you must have meant $1849, at least.  If you're buying new all of them are decent, get the best price from a reliable dealer.  If used, then go over the motor carefully, do the usual checks that have been spoke of here on the board a hundred times and check that the serial numbers are still on it. Too many hot 9.9's around."
218236,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-23 01:50:00,0,"no I was pretty sure it was $849 I took a double look at it and it was right unless costco priced it wrong, but I tell you there was a big empty space were they were and only a couple left, it was at the ajax store this past thurdsay maybe make a call before you go to make sure but I am pretty sure, I even said to myself wow that is chump change for that motor!!"
218299,Sinker,2008-06-23 03:30:00,8692,"IMO, they're all good. The important thing is to get it from a reliable dealer, who is not far from home, and has a good reputation for customer service. If/when you need to get it serviced, you'll be happy that you didn't go across the province to save a few bucks.  Sinker"
218638,issamhay,2008-06-23 23:00:00,77,well i called them adn they said  they dont have any 9.9 mercury's and never had any...
218670,SlowPoke,2008-06-23 23:45:00,2984,"Keep in mind that Mercury, Nissan and Tohatsu are all made by Tohatsu. You will pay a premium for the Merc name while Nissan is only slightly more than Tohatsu. My choice would be a Yamaha. Honda's are nice but pricey."
