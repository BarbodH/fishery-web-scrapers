217878,bassfighter,2008-06-21 18:51:00,366,"Can we Say Carp fishing getting more and more popular for the Following reason:  1. Fish are bundant, for most do not eat Carp. 2. Good fighting fish 3. Fishing for other species are harder these days. 4. We can find them easily at local city habitat. 5. They keep on getting bigger in size as they are being release. 6. They like warm waters and waters have been getting warmer every year. 7. Not always that easy to hunt for them. 8. They are staying more consistantly in the same area. 9. There is always the larger ones out there."
217880,4thgen,2008-06-21 19:00:00,157," It was 40"" and I always figured it was close to 40lbs. I caught one other that was longer but not as fat. I used to almost always sight fish carp with 1/64th jigs with 1"" grubs on a 5'6"" St. Croix ultralight spooled with 4lb. Around 1 in 10 well placed casts drew a hit."

218111,splashhopper,2008-06-22 21:17:00,2931,"I caught my PB Carp today(30"" and about 25lbs) on the oatmeal/peanut/sugar and starch bait i made up. Using 6lb test on a # 8 Laser hook. It was caught on a MUDDY trib out of Lake Erie.     But I still can't get that danged ""hair rig"" tied for the life of me.  If there are any carp guys in the London On area that i could meet up with for a day of carping, that use this rig, i would be willing to drive and meet ya.  thanks Splashhopper"
