218738,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 00:55:00,7971,Wow Gerritt....that little boy of yours sure is a handsome fellow!!!  It's apparent how great of a dad you are from these pics....classic pics for sure.  Your son will look back at them when he's older with a smile on his face for sure!  We had already left for Lakair when you posted this....so I'm glad I caught it before it disappeared!  Bly and I were talking about how it was strange we didn't get to see you this year as one of our highlights last year was fishing with you in your boat.  Take care man...looks like you are enjoying your summer.  All the best to the wife and the little one.
