Great day and great fishing with my son and a great friend who came from Lake Erie to compare notes with me : Magic numbers were: 120-150 fow, 50-80 down, 2.6mph. Sizes from 5 Lbs to 22 Lbs. Mostly bows (surprised as to how many bows we've got in half a day on lake O.) kings and even one Coho. Everything fired at least once (meet, flies, spoons) but my favorite watermelon NK28 spoon was the best and got the most.  Here are few selected pictures from the day for your viewing pleasure:        Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

218153,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-22 22:25:00,2585,i have heard that the fishing has been great in many areas of the province today.  maybe the unstable weather that came in provoted the fish to bite before the storms hit.  Nice looking fish you got into there!  Cheers!
