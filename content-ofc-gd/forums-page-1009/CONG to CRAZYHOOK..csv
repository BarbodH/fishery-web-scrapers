217810,Moosebunk,2008-06-21 13:19:00,3970,"Good show dood.  You're as hardcore as many and this yak fishing is taking off.  What an ambassador. (where the heck are my emoticons now)   CONG.  CONG to you.  Looking forward to my issue.  I have to ask though... why a pike, I thought you were a shark guy.  Sharks from a kayak... now that would draw out the masses to the sport eh..?"
