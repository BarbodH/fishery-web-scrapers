218257,Dondorfish,2008-06-23 02:17:00,1000,"I was out on Chemong last weekend and managed to pick up a Walleye in around 3 lbs. It's been a real long time since I had a nice feed of walleye, so I figured that I would keep it for the pan. All week at work, all I could think about was this fish and chip dinner that I would have, on Saturday night, up at the trailer. (on Chemong) Well, Saturday finally came and I was getting ready to prepare the walleye for dinner. I went to the cupboard to grab my Fish Crisp and low and behold - got none! The wife of my fishing partner was heading into town, so I asked her to grab me some. She came back with a box that was not Fish Crisp - oh well - we'll give it a shot! And this is how it turned out:     And what I thought of it:    Anyone ever try it?    Don    "
218265,Mike the Pike,2008-06-23 02:37:00,3421,Don where you get that I used to buy a no name brand of beer batter and the only thing we can now find here in Quebec is fish crisp.  I will drive to Ontario to get some if you say its good
218267,Beats,2008-06-23 02:42:00,543,im pretty sure I had that same stuff a few months back.  It was definitely the same brand name and I am pretty sure it was beer batter... so most likely the exact same thing.  I remember it being fairly light as far as batter goes and I think I found it at an end of the aisle special for like 99 cents each or something like that.  I'd try it again for sure.
218268,Dondorfish,2008-06-23 02:42:00,1000,"Hey Mike - I think she picked it up at a ""No Frills"" - it was pretty good!  I'll ask her where she got it when I talk to her.   Don   "
218276,Beats,2008-06-23 02:48:00,543,  Mine came from a No Frills as well.  I'd say start your search there.  If possible.
218285,Ron,2008-06-23 02:58:00,1683,"We get our batter from the ""Bulk Barn"" chain. Simply use beer instead of water and the key is to let it stand for a minimum of 15 minutes before using. Just ask the guys that have been to one of my fish fries. Works awesome on button mushrooms, zucchini as appetizers as well."
218292,jace,2008-06-23 03:11:00,472,picked up the same stuff last night just for a change from fish crisp.   ..looks like a good meal to me.  You can tell it's a man-meal because everything on the plate is deep fried.
218302,maybe,2008-06-23 03:33:00,307,"I've seen it at the Sobeys, Loblaws, and A&P in Peterborough.  Club House's product locator form can tell you other locations in Ontario/Eastern and Quebec/Maritimes."
218374,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-23 13:31:00,0,I've heard some good reviews of many batters this month. I think I will try Daryl Chronzy's or Fish Crisp's Jerk seasoning first and then I will give the beer batter a try.
218397,steve_paul,2008-06-23 14:09:00,658,We used the English Style Batter on Sat night - was very good and lighter than the beer batter.
