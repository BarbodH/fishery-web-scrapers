218983,anders,2008-06-24 15:43:00,1168,"Saturday afternoon i got a call to go back to a lake and try our luck.  We have been to this lake once before, only to be blown off without a line in the water.  This night was differnt.  We picked an island to concentrate around, picked our rigs and started the troll.  Within the first five seconds..BANG...fish on....lost it at the boat, but looked like a nice 16-18 inch eye.  We had a good feeling.  Not long after that, Mark hits one, and we are happy...the lucky strike strikes again.   We were catching all walleye between 17-18 inches, until Mark says ""getting a bite......FISH ON""  his rod doubles over, i kill the engine and after a lengthy battle, this 7lb emerges and make a safe landing in the net.  After a few pics he is released to get even larger.     Soon we had two nice limits for home and off we went, satisfied that our plan and luck came together.   We were both using our favourite lure, a lucky strike 2 1/2  Victor with a hole worm, trolling up a shore line in 6-22 fow.  Here is a friendly visitor we meet on the way in.  Hopefully he hangs arounf till October "
