218074,Rizzo,2008-06-22 18:53:00,4754,Somebody posted about a day on the upper niagara about 4 or 5 days ago and had a picture of a musky along a shoreline. I haven't been around much and wanted to read the rest of it but can't seem to find it. Was it pulled for some reason or am I just blind
218115,Alumacraft,2008-06-22 21:34:00,139,I believe the original poster deleted the thread because it was pointed out that he was fishing for muskies and the season was infact still closed.
218142,ehg,2008-06-22 22:06:00,2666,"Yes the thread was pulled and the musky was caught out of season in the LOWER niagara, so the guide replied a little later."
218144,danc,2008-06-22 22:13:00,4677,The thread was left up long enough for everyone to have their say IMHO. Then it was deleted by the mods.
218470,Rizzo,2008-06-23 16:56:00,4754," thanks guys. I believe I was the first to reply and I remember saying that it didn't look like any shoreline on the upper niagara that I could think of. Wasn't aware of the season issue because my boat is still in storage, haven't even thought about fishing yet"
218603,xrap,2008-06-23 21:36:00,683,Just took a quick look at the regs and says musky is open 1st saturday in June. Is this correct?
218609,jwl,2008-06-23 21:49:00,1056,"that's the key there..""quick look"" see the exceptions on Pg 91 for the Upper Niagara...from the Peace Bridge downstream to the falls ,it's the 3rd Saturday"
