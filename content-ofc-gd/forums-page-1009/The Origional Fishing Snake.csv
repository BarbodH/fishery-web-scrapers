190533,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-21 22:30:00,3761,Has anybody heard of the Origional Fishing Snake?
190536,Marko,2008-04-21 22:34:00,854,There was a video posted of a bait looking like a snake not while ago. IT looked great for musky and bigger critters lol. Not sure if that was the original snake bait. People on a promotional video were catching big bass.
190537,purekgw,2008-04-21 22:37:00,585,yah i have seen it on youtube but dunno where to buy em at i would like to try 1
190538,Marko,2008-04-21 22:39:00,854,I am prety sure you can get them on ebay or maybe even bass pro shop or cabelas. Search around if you`d really like one here is a link to the video site http://www.naturalmotionlures.com/
190540,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-21 22:42:00,3761,"I bought these over the winter. I can't wait to try them got there is  the site below and watch the videos. I beleive in this bait. I will have results this upcoming season. Or i hope so.  http://www.bassprofessor.com/elite/originalfishingsnake.php   I tried the smaller package, but it takes a while(1 month) to get to Oshawa as it is in the US."
190544,purekgw,2008-04-21 22:48:00,585,i want 1 
190548,gone_fishin,2008-04-21 23:01:00,481,"yet another great marketing campaign that has ""caught"" the average fisherman... there was the flying lure, the banjo minnow, now this ridiculous snake!  sorry boys, but they caught you!  here's an article you should read before making any other purchases on infomercials.  http://fishing.about.com/od/fishingtermina...a/aa070204a.htm"
190553,purekgw,2008-04-21 23:14:00,585,i just want to try it.......  how u know it wont work?
190568,gone_fishin,2008-04-21 23:37:00,481,"did you read the article? I'm basically agreeing with it, otherwise i wouldn't have posted it.  and i quote ""Any kind of lure will catch fish under some conditions. A Banjo (Minnow) Lure will work but so would a banjo pick on a hook, under the right conditions.""  i'm just throwing this out there, but how many fish in Ontario waters do you think eat snakes? I've seen some water snakes cruising around the surface of lakes, but have yet to see a fish hit one... not saying it hasn't happened, but i'm saying it's unlikely... i think a surface frog would be a much better option than a snake, at least in Ontario anyway.  I'm not a pessimist... I'm a realist!  if any of you guys do catch something with it, i'd love to hear about it..."
190572,Golfisher,2008-04-21 23:43:00,586,"Now that you know about this top secret bait, I'm gonna have to terminate you all with extreme prejudice."
190577,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-21 23:52:00,3761,baby snakes are found in all bodies of water.
190603,Burning Babies,2008-04-22 00:30:00,150,"Not really.  More likely he, like myself, has seen many similar add campaigns for the newest ""super lure"" amount to nothing more than a fat paycheck for some entrepreneur.  Ever see one turn up in the money in a tournament circuit?  I haven't."
190609,gone_fishin,2008-04-22 00:39:00,481,"  not exactly... i just found that article today... i said i agree with it... i wanted to find something to back up my statements. i'm sure i could find a half dozen more articles of the same topic.  i've used the flying lure and used the banjo minnow, both with minimal success. this is just another hyped up ""super lure"" like what was mentioned by Burning Babies (awesome name by the way).  i hope you guys do catch some fish with this bait... but i'm not buying into it, because i know the results of previous ""super lures"" from TV."
190617,irishfield,2008-04-22 00:50:00,26272,It's limited though since you can only use it in your secret spot !
190622,setomonkey,2008-04-22 00:57:00,872,I bet this lure would kill on Lake X...
190624,purekgw,2008-04-22 00:58:00,585,but this snake more then likely will work up north for some big large mouth and there are snakes all over so they prob have munched a few down
190686,huntervasili,2008-04-22 02:23:00,1604,Double....
190701,huntervasili,2008-04-22 02:37:00,1604," I remember now... the song is VEGEMATIC by Steve Goodman, basically sums it all up..."
190706,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:40:00,2710,"Ah Doug Hannon the king of fishing private stocked ponds for trophy largemouth, worse than Bill Dance."
190709,Musky or Specks,2008-04-22 02:42:00,2710,Also you just could have gone out and bought PorkO's virtually the same thing.
190713,GBW,2008-04-22 02:48:00,8460,"i can see it now, all the $1.00 stores sold out of rubber snakes...  HAHA"
190719,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-22 02:55:00,4399,I have about 50 pounds of various plastic baits in my boat the last thing I need or want is 57 snakes a 284 page book 3 DVD`s etc.  Gotcha hook line and visa number!
218356,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-23 13:00:00,3761,"I am going to be using these baits this opening saturday for some bass. So i will have some results for some of you ""non believers"" and some reasons for the people who want to try this bait. Best of luck to those fishing opening day."
218363,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-23 13:15:00,0,Any wiggly piece of plastic will catch fish. I bet reeling in a 8 inch plastic worm would be just as affective(and cheaper).
218364,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-23 13:19:00,0,As kids we had Snake Baits as one of our best producing lures for Bass. As we got older the snake baits hit the bottom of the tackle box as we no longer fished for the Green Carp. Snake baits are a killer lure on certain lakes and at different times of the season.   Good luck.
