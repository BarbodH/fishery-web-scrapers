I'm not familiar with this type of fishing at all so I need a little help.  He wants a river with in season action for anything from Browns to maybe smallmouth. I was thinking the Grand was his best bet, but figured I'd open the floor to some suggestions.  Thanks in advance..."

218553,addy79,2008-06-23 19:37:00,573,NIAGARA!!  forgot about that one!  anyone know of a good location to fish from shore?
218568,davew3,2008-06-23 20:00:00,430,I would agree to the Forks of the Credit.  In the park and just above it.  North of Brampton off hwy 10.

However most of it is a no kill zone, barbless hooks, no organic bait, etc. so you'll need to consider that."
