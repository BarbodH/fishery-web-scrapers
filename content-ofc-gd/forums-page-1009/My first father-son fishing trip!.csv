217922,mepps,2008-06-21 22:39:00,1301,"My son Ash is now 9 months old.  He loves playing with my fishing equipment lying around the house and I've donated a couple of old reels to his toy box for him to play with. The weather here in Nova Scotia has been very inconsistent, but recently has warmed up quite a bit. After waking up to a nice sunny day, I decided this was the prefect day to have father son fishing trip.  We headed to the a nearby lake that is stocked regularly with trout. It happens to be the closest lake to Halifax, and is on a bus route, so needless to say it receives heavy fishing pressure. Early visits to the lake in April resulted in a severe skunking, but recently we have been catching smallmouth bass constantly - all under 11 inches long .  We didn't fish long because Ash got upset everytime I let a fish go, but I managed a few nice little bass.      "

217948,jediangler,2008-06-22 02:46:00,1923,Excellent  Great pics I gave my daughter an ultra-light spinning reel when she was two. It was attached to a ice-fishing rod with a hookless rubber frog tied on. She would cast it around the house and get our pet rat to chase it on the floor. Gotta keep it fun.
217949,limeyangler,2008-06-22 02:49:00,5204,COOL!
