219068,aplumma,2008-06-24 19:01:00,6896,I just wanted to update some of the people who were concerned about my health Sunday. On Monday I went to the doctors and found that I had infections in both of my sinus passages from the pine pollen and am now on antibiotics to clear it up. I am feeling fine and working everyday trying to get caught up with all of the plumbing that broke while I was gone. Thanks again for you alls concern and well wishes and for Glen for driving us home even though he had but a nights sleep before he had to drive another 12 hours. I can honestly say that a mans Dawg is truly his best friend.  Art
