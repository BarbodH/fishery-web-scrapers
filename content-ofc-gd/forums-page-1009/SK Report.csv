218211,holdfast,2008-06-23 00:52:00,1813,"Last Weekend me and Rodger decided to try out Baxter Lake.  That was the Lake that that was a few hundred meters from Dugout.  The fishing started off great as I hooked into a big one but lost the fish and my Rapala.     Afterwards the wind picked up and made canoeing difficult.  We ended up hooking into lots of small ones.  All fish were released   Apparently I was told that the Island had burned down, now I know why.  Any guesses how forest fires start if it ain't Lightning.   Anyways this weekend I decided to stick close to the Trailer and fish Cowan lake in Big River.  Actually Cowan is a Widening of Big River which is Dammed some 5o kms North.   Just down the Hill is the Boat Launch and a camping site    And its free to Park and Launch.  What a concept eh    Couple of Good ole Boys taken off    Here is a Pic of the Wharf from the Boat.  You are guaranteed to catch Pike off the Dock.   There is a couple that drives from Saskatoon 3 Hrs just to Dock Fish    As were cruising I wished that I could own a house on the Lake.  So far its not too populated but prices are up Big time now.  I guess Ill just be lucky that I got my trailer, shed and Lot for $9,000     Yea I bought this JVC speaker for 10 dollars.  Folds up as a case.  Great camping Item   We found these weeds in the middle of the lake and it dropped to 14 feet.  We caught pike with almost every cast.  No size but eating size.     Like a true Native, Rodger couldn't pass up a Meal or two of Jack.    Also a great camping and fishing item is the LED light that fits the hat.  Look mom my hands are free to tie knots at nite.  Wow I had a scare as my motor was acting up.  It started with a puff of smoke and not Running on all Cylinders.  Changed the spark plug and back to normal.  I figure it would of been a 12 hour Paddle back at Night    Three Pelicans, nasty, nasty fish eaters   Longest day of the year, Beautiful sunset after 10 PM, love it, and calm.  Next week I may camp on one of the Islands or camp at Baxter, I'm told there's monsters in there.  Cowan, hopefully I can find the Pickerel "

218398,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-23 14:11:00,0,A nice looking lake with some good structure. I have yet to fish water that calm this season! Looks like some decent pike too. Too bad about the big one that got away.  Dang! I forgot June 21 was longest day of the year!!!Nice sunset shot. Thanks for sharing.

That little JVC speaker of yours is a nifty idea.  I like how you can throw the mp3 player and spare batteries in there, and everything's in one place.  Think I paid $20 for our Logitech clamshell gizmo."
