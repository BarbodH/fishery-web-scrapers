185712,forrest,2008-04-11 23:27:00,1032,"So you just got a whole whack of fishing lures, lets say 50: Rapala's, mepps, double-loons etc...  What do you do with them?  whats the logic of leaving them in the boxes?"
185716,irishfield,2008-04-11 23:33:00,26272,I unpack'm all.. and on many I tear the ident tag off the box/card and put it in the tray spot the lures in.. so when I lose the dang thing I know what it was !
185717,muskymike,2008-04-11 23:34:00,772,"unpack, sharpen all hooks then put away or try to and realize i ned more boxes haha"
185719,silveradosheriff,2008-04-11 23:38:00,1025,Open - upgrade hooks.
185727,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 23:52:00,6623,"I don`t shell out a lot of cash on lures any more, used too, best bet is to buy one or two and see if they work for what your doing or intend them for, then load up.  Like the Sheriff hook change on some is the first step after opening the package."
185738,Raf,2008-04-12 00:24:00,3495,water test them.
185740,danc,2008-04-12 00:28:00,4677,I've got lures that are 15+ years old that are still in the unopened box.
185790,mbac31,2008-04-12 01:53:00,904,"First I unpack them all. Upgrade all the hooks unless they are  high quality from the start. I personally use the Daichi's and then I put hook guards on all of them. Place them in the corosponding boxes. Label the boxes with a waterproof label. I started using Bullfrog anti-rust emitter strips so there is no moisture in the boxes. When all of this is done I take and catalogue all of them for insurance purposes. I have a very large bait collection now so thats a big factor of mine. I have some swimbaits worth over $150 us right down to the $1.00 baits. Some people collect other stuff, I collect fishing gear. THere are a few guys here that have sen my bait collection and have called m crazy.  I have now switched to all the new line of Falcon Tackle storage boxes. They are cheap and store stuff very well. The jig box cant be beat. I also collect lures. I have some over 20 years and till have yet to be opened.  The most important thing is to take pics of the stuff each year as you are putting it in the boat or whatever. Insurance companies can be sots when it comes to this stuff."
185815,PatrickGG,2008-04-12 02:31:00,562,"Exactly what smallie said, I heard its healthy to keep them in the box the packaging absorbs the moisture and keeps the hooks from rusting."
185822,Sinker,2008-04-12 02:34:00,8692,"i usually buy them in two's or 3's, one gets put in the box out of the package....the others stay in the pack until I lose the first one.  Sinker"
185837,Radnine,2008-04-12 02:55:00,1538, Ya..thats what I do too. Not
185840,kennyman,2008-04-12 02:58:00,737,"The don't work well for me in the boxes, so I unpack them.  Hard to hook the fish as well."
185862,huntervasili,2008-04-12 03:20:00,1604,Where's the option to open em all and put em in the tackle box then keep the lure boxes in another tray? ahem Gerritt Myself I do about the same as Wayne with many the others have no ID or boxes...
185865,irishfield,2008-04-12 03:24:00,26272,That's for firestarter when he's shipwrecked Bill !
185885,huntervasili,2008-04-12 04:13:00,1604, I figured that or he'd use it to return all his tackle when he comes to the realization that he's no fisherman
185920,lew,2008-04-12 11:01:00,12767,Sharpen the hooks and stick the bait in the lake where it belongs
185936,Rich Clemens,2008-04-12 12:22:00,3131,Unpack and in the box.  I typically have two boxes with me.   One is those old plastic milk crates filled with downspout and the larger lures.  Smaller box with some of the smaller baits and extra terminal tackle.  I usually have a third box that I keep in the cabin with duplicates and the lesser used baits.
185962,Billy Bob,2008-04-12 13:32:00,5865,"You can buy lures in a box. Huh, I have always made my own jigs.  Is this something like getting fish in a box like when we are walleye trolling Lake Erie we always hear on the VHS radio from other boats ""We got 4 fish in the box"". To this day I have never caught any walleyes that where in a box. I guess this year I will be trying some of these lures in a box you all speak of."
186025,walleyejigger,2008-04-12 17:00:00,876,"unpack and sharpen, although no way in hell i would by that many lures, but to each his own"
186097,jjcanoe,2008-04-12 20:22:00,744,Unpack them in the house. It keeps garbage off our shorelines.  jjcanoe
186110,setomonkey,2008-04-12 20:51:00,872,"Unpack, rather leave the garbage at home than on the boat, and saves room in the tackle bag.  Now, whether I actually use those new lures is another story...    Mike"
186188,ChrisK,2008-04-12 23:19:00,2772,"Unpack all lures, hang them like pictures around the house to admire and then put in tackle box after wife tells me to get them off the walls"
186193,mbac31,2008-04-12 23:35:00,904, I thought I was bad.
