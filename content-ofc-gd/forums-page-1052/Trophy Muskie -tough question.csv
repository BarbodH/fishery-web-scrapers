185387,charlesn,2008-04-11 13:13:00,551,"Out of curiosity, what would the potential world record musky be worth?  Like in the tens of thousands? hundreds of thousands?  millions?  The last couple amounts are literally life changing sums of money (to most average citizens) and I'd think you'd have to be crazy not to seriously consider it.  After all, giant specimen or not, it's just one fish and if it is like other species, once they get to that size, their days of successfully passing along their genes are gone and almost certainly it is near the end of its life cycle so you might be releasing it to be turtle food anyways.  Scrutiny aside, if it was legit and done on the up and up and you could provide a better lifestyle for your family, how can you pass that up?  Also, why do boat manufacturers not design a musky sized livewell?  I know my bass boat certainly would not fit even a decent sized musky unless I could somehow fold it in half.    But a giant livewell might keep the fish alive for inspection, weighing, scale samples, etc. and still allow for a live release.  Charles"
185388,lew,2008-04-11 13:19:00,12767," It'd be even neater if you told your grand kids that you caught the biggest musky in the world, then let it go to become even bigger, and explained to them that it's not always necessary to kill things just because you have the power to do so.  Course that's only my opinion............"
185390,capt bruce,2008-04-11 13:22:00,820,"Was gonna type an answer , BUT LEW beat me to it , WELL SAID Lew , (and his answer comes from someone who has a good chance at catching it )"
185397,largemouth,2008-04-11 13:32:00,112,"Nope, the grandkids would be able to see and touch my record muskie.  if/when  i catch the world record muskie or world record any species I would keep it, no question!  thats why i fish, to chase and hopefully catch the record. I'd even keep a personal best muskie or any species of fish for the wall even if it wasn't a record, as long as it is within the law of course. but i don't frown upon those who release their fish."
185416,fishinggeek,2008-04-11 14:17:00,325,"To each their own, I suppose.  This is all hypothetical, as I'll never catch it, but I would keep it.  It would be the only muskie I'll ever keep.  Keeping any sport fish, including muskie, is not sacreligious.  That's why they aren't on the endangered/protected/extinct list and that's why there are possession limits.  And I don't think killing one fish, muskie or otherwise, teaches children to kill because one can.  If that were true, that argument could be made for consuming meat, leather, or other intentional acts of killing.  Keeping any fish, in my opinion, is not harmful to children in and of itself, including the killing of a mess of perch or a world record muskie.  Plus the grand kids would see me in newspaper!  And Charles, I'm not sure how much a world-record muskie is worth, but I'm guessing not much.  I mean Ken O'Brien lucked out by catching his with a Rapala, one of the biggest fishing companies out there.  I'm not sure how much he made, if any, but my gut feeling is not enough to be life changing.  I certainly wouldn't be doing it for financial gain."
185418,Gerritt,2008-04-11 14:22:00,6129,"A world record fish could be worth MILLIONS advertising contracts, product spots etc... Would I keep a world record fish when we are talking about that kind of money?? Yes I would.....  But only if I was sure it was a world record fish... The likely hood of that happening? Next to nil.  G"
185420,Raf,2008-04-11 14:25:00,3495, Catch a WR muskie and I'd let the highest bidder dictate what I caught it on.
185424,darsky,2008-04-11 14:31:00,586,Raf-I know someone who just may catch it AND he has that same view
185425,fishinggeek,2008-04-11 14:32:00,325, Hah!  Never thought of that.  Maybe Ken didn't use a Rapala after all!
185430,capt bruce,2008-04-11 14:41:00,820,"Maybe ken didnt catch it atall , maybe it was floating on the surface  maybe maybe It will all be questioned when as Irish said they get around to him . It may be worth millions to the tackle industry but I dont think Obrien got much maybe a free box or two of shad raps ,"
185445,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 15:15:00,6623,"Charles, actually Crestliner used to or maybe still makes one. I think the model was CMV or something like that, had a 54 inch livewell and was sort of designed for muskie fishermen. It was the model I was interested in before illness caused me to change plans.  Seen some guys with them on the Muskie lakes around here, and at boat displays, 18'3"" rated for like 150HP.  LOL stick a lot of bass in that livewell!  http://www.boattrader.com/listing/2006-CRE...V-1850-91926907"
185447,irishfield,2008-04-11 15:17:00,26272,I could probably flood my boat to the floor line and use the rod storage locker !
186011,tonka-toy,2008-04-12 16:33:00,139,"well big D, all you have to do is be there when i catch her,snap a picture(carefull with the background),and let me take care of the rest.should be around first week of sep prior to the full moon."
186087,Roy,2008-04-12 20:02:00,13728,"It'll be fine. Pics are nice, especially when you hold them up right for bounty fishing. You might even win $200. I think that these folks who catch fish in one Province and enter them in another are really honest people too. The list of names of 'save our muskies"" folks who are members there is astounding....including some very good guides and some writers of ""help our fishies"" folks.  Getting tired of the rhetoric.....blow it out your ear.  I'm sure that the banner will disappear from our web community very soon."
186121,setomonkey,2008-04-12 21:06:00,872,"Not worth it to me. I'd get more satisfaction from having the photos and being able to tell the story than killing a trophy fish like that. Not just muskies, I'd feel the same way about any species.  But that's my feeling about it, it's up to the guy who catches that world record. Long as it's legal within the regs, I've got no business telling someone else what to do.  Mike"
186125,2 tone z71,2008-04-12 21:21:00,1311,"HAHA I like the handle fits well,thats a sweet ride for sure Big W,im looking so forward to getting out got a few new rods/reels and a hugh beckman net to land her lol,just got back with DBs ATV pike and walleye opens in 2 weeks doing any"
186185,mepps,2008-04-12 23:13:00,1301,"I'd let her go for sure.  I dont hold much faith in the old musky records anyway.  I'd possibly keep a record bass though.  heres some pictures of some of the biggest musky on record Cal Johnson, 67 lbs   Lawton, 69 pounds 15 ounces  and  Spray, 69 pounds 11 ounces "
185166,2 tone z71,2008-04-11 00:34:00,1311,"after putting the docks in today and looking over the open water thinking about fishing,say I where to catch my Trophy Muskie possibly world record say 60 inch or better,Hey my Dad got a 57 2 yrs ago so its possibly,anyhow my question WOULD IT HAVE TO BE KILLED to be legit for weighing purposes pics verification etc,how would ya go about such a task"
185171,irishfield,2008-04-11 00:37:00,26272,Yes current criteria = dead.
185173,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-11 00:39:00,314,what is the world record for a musky?
185178,2 tone z71,2008-04-11 00:43:00,1311, thank you sir
185179,irishfield,2008-04-11 00:45:00,26272,"Someone did a good post last season on the steps/hoops. Beleive it was Marc Thorpe or could have been Maina. IMHO, not worth the heartache after the fact ...substantiating your catch every time you turn around."
185183,HTHM,2008-04-11 00:53:00,4082,Is there not a catch and release record as well?
185184,Crazyhook,2008-04-11 00:54:00,1154,  3 / 4 of one
185186,irishfield,2008-04-11 00:55:00,26272,
185188,Gerritt,2008-04-11 00:56:00,6129,Unless it is bigger then this..... let it swim...    G
185189,muskymike,2008-04-11 00:57:00,772,"I would have to say, I dont think its worth it. take a pic, measure let it go. just think, next year you could catch it again.....or somebody else can (but will probably kill it for the glory)"
185191,irishfield,2008-04-11 01:00:00,26272,I was just gonna say G... O'Brien's is up next for scrutiny.
185195,Gerritt,2008-04-11 01:02:00,6129,you got that right Wayne....  G
185205,Kerry,2008-04-11 01:11:00,383,I thought there was an article on a released musky from Nippissing last year that was considered for world record status/live release?That would be my choice even though I do buy a sport license just in case I ever catch one and couldn't revive it.  Kerry
185207,irishfield,2008-04-11 01:14:00,26272,"It was ""considered"" that it could have been big enough to be a new world record. I don't think they even actually measured it completely. They definitely didn't weigh it."
185209,danc,2008-04-11 01:19:00,4677, Is there any weighed Muskie that isn't in dispute these days? A never ending battle it seems.
185216,irishfield,2008-04-11 01:31:00,26272,Doesn't appear to be Dan.. once they discredit the two ahead of O'Brien.. then he'll be next. Why I've always said.. I'd let her swim!
185219,danc,2008-04-11 01:37:00,4677,"Actually Wayne, an old neighbor of mine when I was a kid, is in that mix. His name was Robert Malo. If you look it up, he's just another controversial potential world record holder. Sadly, he passed away a few years ago."
185222,irishfield,2008-04-11 01:45:00,26272,The unfortunate part is.. it seems they wait 'till you're gone to discredit the catch. No live witnesses make things easier maybe?  http://toothycritters.com/malo.html
185223,danc,2008-04-11 01:52:00,4677,"Thanks for the link Wayne. His wife use to babysit me when I was a child. I had no idea of his potential fame until many years later.  Quite a story, however it turned out."
185234,kickingfrog,2008-04-11 02:21:00,8333,"The question is easy, the answer is another matter.  I don't know if I ever would keep a record Musky. I don't fish for self-worth.  If someone wanted to keep a record... First, on the boat there is no way to know for sure it is even a/the record (I'd feel even worse if I killed the 2nd biggest musky ever). Second, if you keep it as the O'Brian fish and others have shown, there will be detractors.  Having said that, if the season is open and the angler possesses the proper license he or she has every right to keep said fish. If you don't like that, then get the regs changed and leave the angler alone.  The feeling among many is that the next record musky is going to be caught in a lake that has a catch and release only season, which of course means that it won't be the official record."
185253,muskymatt,2008-04-11 02:48:00,2608,No dead muskie is a good muskie
185270,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 03:26:00,6623,"I fished to gamble, for fun, for education, to get away from work(real job). Just can`t imagine a reason that would make me want to keep any fish any more except to give the wife and kids a fish dinner once a year or so."
185348,outllaw,2008-04-11 11:55:00,1232,just fish. have fun. enjoy the outdoors. the trophy record thing has created wars in the past. . there will always be a dispute on musky records. even dead fish are scrutinized.
185364,Roy,2008-04-11 12:27:00,13728,It's what happens as soon as money is thrown into the equation.
185386,fishinggeek,2008-04-11 13:10:00,325,"I've caught a few muskies and never kept one.  And I wouldn't even if I was fortunate enough to catch a 50 pound one.  But if I caught one that I thought had a good chance as a record, I'd definitely keep it.  It'd be neat to tell the grand kids I had a world record!"
