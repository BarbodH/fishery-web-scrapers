186548,PickerelHunter,2008-04-13 18:06:00,100,"Drove around yesterday, covered about 300 km throughout the whole day just looking at some present or future fishing spots around Barrie.  Went to look at some streams and rivers where I hope to try steelheading eventually.  Stopped in at Trombley's to check out their big sale, TONS of people, about 50 waiting in line and another 50 or more roaming around, just crazy.  Had only a few bucks worth of stuff and once I saw the line I said screw this, not worth it.  Outside I had some of the best chicken wings I've ever had, and the turkey was very good too.  Anyways, headed down to where I knew people were catching crappies and decided to join them.  Never been here but will be back, the place was just packed on shore and quite a few boats too.  Didn't have much luck for the first hour or so, thus I moved on to find some other spots but most were either provate property or unaccessable.  Came back to fish with the crowd and found a fairly less crowded spot and got into a few using a micro tube without a float, just barely jigging it back.  Here's the Nottawasaga...not sure what it's supposed to look like, but looks VERY flooded to me      The crappie spot (it's no secret, everyone's there)    My first crappie since 2006 (remember I was overseas for 2007, so it's not as bad as that sounds!!)    And finally a nice sized one  "

186550,Minnow,2008-04-13 18:14:00,177,"Congrats on your first crappie, try fishing near sunken logs or trees they seem to all be there"
186551,PickerelHunter,2008-04-13 18:15:00,100,Started off with minnows and only had that small one to show for it.  Maybe the bite was just turning on when I switched to the microtube.
186604,tbayboy,2008-04-13 20:54:00,1497,Congrats Pickeral.  I think I was fishing beside you yesterday - I was the guy with the Shimano rain jacket that showed up a bit before you headed out to look over spots.  Sounds like I left before the action came on (only managed a couple myself).
186630,Fisherman,2008-04-13 21:43:00,7201,The Notty is normally about 6-8 feet lower than the above pics.
186716,PickerelHunter,2008-04-14 00:16:00,100,"Tbay---ya that was definately you...nice to informally meet you.  Thanks for the info you shared with me.  I didn't fish back at that same spot, kind of around the corner and it wasn't until about 5-6.  I'll be back there on MOnday after work for the evening bite.  Fisherman---WOW, I can't believe it's up that much more then usual...any idea how long it takes before the levels go back to normal...and do you steelheaders fish it when it's this high?"
186731,Fisherman,2008-04-14 00:34:00,7201,"With the remaining snow cover in the hills and the usual spring rain, I would almost bet another 3-4 weeks before it comes down to a quasi normal level.  The Mad was over the banks again yesterday morning and the Pine just borderline.  I wouldn't bother fishing it with these conditions, gawd, you'd need a cannonball to hold down the roebag."
186751,kickingfrog,2008-04-14 00:59:00,8333," The water levels are little higher than normal but that area is the Minesing Swamp. It is meant to flood, if it didn't many things would be completely different. If fools (and the governments that allow them) continue to built in flood plains, they will only make things worse.  Building levies, funneling money and resources into flood relief and prevention is money poorly spent. The water will come down, sooner or later. But don't worry, it will come back up next spring, it always does.  This isn't meant to be directed at anybody, I'm just tired of seeing the local news lead with yet another story about someone living three feet from a river that has ""unexpectedly"" risen right up to, and into their homes, during the thaw. Of course they talked to the same people last year, and the year before that, and... and... and... ""Well you see that mark on the side of the house? That's how high the water was last year. But that's not as bad as the one year when the water came right up to the windows on the second floor."" The definition of insanity is????  Phew, I feel better. Thanks for letting me vent a little."
