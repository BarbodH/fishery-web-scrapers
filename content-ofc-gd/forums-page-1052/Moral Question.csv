185461,Sinker,2008-04-11 15:45:00,8692,"What kind of structure are we talking here? Could be a doghouse for all we know......  what are you talking about when you say the footings gave out? Sounds like something built on blocks.......  I'm assuming its something fairly big if it took you a week to build it?  Need more details.  In the long run, its better to do things right the first time around, even if it costs double......this is a perfect example. I don't take jobs if they're looking for trouble by doing things on the cheap.  If its something worth doing, do it right the first time.  If it was something I did that caused it to blow down, I'd rebuild it no questions asked. If it was the owners idea to do it half assed, and you suggested doing it right.....I'd send the bill.  I always say one good job will get you another, one bad job will lose 10. Word of mouth is very powerful in trades.  Sinker"

Just something that ensures your cashflow stays relatively unchanged while still offering virtually the same discount, not to mention it assures you he will be back over the next 2-3 years.  It's tought to charge full price on a job the 2nd time around, but he also chose to avoid insurance. I sure wouldn't want to make the call."
185476,ch312,2008-04-11 16:10:00,1590, exactly!
185583,brickNblock,2008-04-11 18:54:00,598," BigCliff, You are 100% correct in your post...... When we bought here, we bought as our retirement property....and that will never change! Perhaps down the road our kids may run into a situation and curse long after we are gone but, On our ..""Plan of Survey"" There is no dimensions given for the existing deck.. It is just an etched in area showing a deck roughly 1/3 the size of the house................it is a very large deck. We will re-build this deck to original length but will be adjusting the width to where the existing bottom landing is...roughly by 5' There is nothing in the OBC for/against this in our area. For our own sake...it wil be built with the proper material/spec's...to accomadate a roof we'll add. Enclosing this new deck in not an issue either....... We'll just install some windows..(The longest water front view will be almost entirely windows)... some Exterior cladding...and a new roof to attach to the existing roof ridge board of the house as it stands. As for later down the road........... Well, there will be nothing of concern as there is no dimension given/shown and for all itense and purposes it will look exactly as shown as per ""Plan of Survey"".  Please folks dont do this at home tho..... All im saying is that according to the Town Survey it will appear as 'AS WAS'..... Your neighbours must be of good gravity and true friendship durring inital to completion of the project. Once up..as I stated..it will be just as was... If there never was a deck prior too or if there was and dimensions given/shown........ I'd need a permit............FOR SURE! bNb  Septic systems are a whole other dangerous scenario when on the water as you are fully aware B-Cliff."
185596,HTHM,2008-04-11 19:23:00,4082,"Gentlemen, and Ladies if applicable A number of you did pick up on a important bit of info, the fact that the structure was blown down by extremely high winds...... In no way was I at fault in the failure of this structure, both the client and I agree on this. As a matter of fact I had done a repair job for him 2 or 3 jobs ago that I was not happy with. He did not receive a bill for that work. My integrity is valuable to me. As well, there is no need to question the workmanship as that is a moot point. The original structure was built to his instructions, and specs. It boils down to ""Feces happens"""
185621,Moosebunk,2008-04-11 20:23:00,3970,"What if it blows over again...  Free or 50% off.  Mother nature can rip anything apart, you can't be held fully accountable everytime you build a structure that gets devestated by things beyond your control, or weather totally beyond normal-bad weather.  But yet only you know the job you did first time around, so your conscience should dictate your next action."
185632,Roy,2008-04-11 20:42:00,13728,"After having re-read the entire thread, I've come to the conclusion that you had your own answer to your 'question' when you started the thread."
185650,HTHM,2008-04-11 21:21:00,4082,However it has been a heck of a debate though.....
185653,misfish,2008-04-11 21:23:00,29133,"I have build many decks and fences and other. When I did the work, it was pretty much over kill on the structure. Even was asked at times why all the extra support. Im one for extra and it makes me feel proud that I did a good job for thier comfort and saftey. Yes I too have been asked to do it cheap,thats where I say no can do. PRIDE is the only reason why. Like many have asked,what happen to the support? Myself,If I feel I did the job right,and the customer is willing to flip the material bill,I would say you did a good job and HE knows it.  I have one for ya. I got a job to build a fence and 2 decks for a customer. All turned out real nice and even picked up a few jobs from it. I had a gate, I had built as solid as fort knox,and one day we had a major storm with high winds. The door got blown off it,s hindges,(snapped the hing and wood.but the customer admited the door was not closed and the wind wiped the door right off. He was more then happy to have me rebuild and pay FULL for materials and labour.I just asked for the cost of material. Like said in one of the posts,it paid back with another 3 customers.You cant blame nature for mishaps."
185680,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-11 22:15:00,1183,"  My initial feeling when reading your first post was that 50% was too high of a discount.  After reading the above...he has to ""EAT"" some of this as well.  The fact that he has asked YOU to rebuild says much about his confidence in your skills.  He made an error as well.  Whether it's a 50/50 split or more/less that is between the two of you.  When I waitressed...I had no sympathy nor tolerance for skammers.  I recall approaching a customer a few minutes after delivering him his steak, and when I asked him if all was okay...he just looked at me and continued to chew...a few minutes later, with 3/4 of the steak gone, I again asked if all was okay....he said No...he was not happy.  Heeellloooo you just consumed 3/4 of the steak.... I took it upon myself and refused to go to ""bat"" for him...and I didn't care if he ever came back.  I am not suggesting your client is this way, but there are some ""clients/customers"" that you really don't care to ever see again.  Your integrity does comes through.  I wish you the best in this...but do not take the full burden...your client owns some of this as well."
185687,Casey123,2008-04-11 22:29:00,461, Got to agree here!
185883,nofish4me,2008-04-12 04:07:00,404,"Noticed a couple of things. You said you built it to his specs. What does he know? You also said that you did jobs for him that you weren't happy with the result and you didn't charge him (that's the way I read it). Now comes my questions to you (not trying to upset you), but have to ask. 1.) Did you get permits and inspections on original structure? 2.) Why have you done work you weren't satisfied with?  Possible outs for your problem, if it was built to code, charge him. You could discount the job and take no loss, just no profit. If you did this as a ""Trunk Slammer"", you'll probably have some good reason why it happened and charge him anyway. My biggest question is; Why would you do work you are not satisfied with?"
185421,Tootsie II,2008-04-11 14:28:00,162,"To answer Ch312, if you did a total renovation without a permit, the municipality could order you to open up every inch of the walls to allow inspection of the structural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing elements. They of course could also haul your butt into court for not getting a permit.  We have even had a least two houses built illegally that were hidden from the roadways that were discovered. In both cases the judges ordered them bulldozed because there were serious breaches of the planning by-laws or environmental/health unit regulations. One was estimated to cost over $ 200,000. to build.  With regard to small airports, they are indeed federally regulated and the provincial building codes and planning regulations do not for the most part apply. There have been some minor exceptions, but most buliding inspectors who've laid charges for hangars built without a permit were promptly laughed out of court by the judge/J.o.P..  With regard to the original thread, as a former building ""techie"" I am wondering how a footing would fail causing a collapse in a wind storm. With the possible exception of horizontal silo's, most footings are below ground. The fact that the customer is willing to pay for the material to reconstruct leaves me wondering about the original design. Is the customer getting an insurance settlement that he is not owning up to? I think like some one else has suggested, I'd make sure that my staff labour costs including E.I., WSIB, CPP and any other costs are covered and then consider eating the costs of my own time, labour and profit. This would be especially true if the customer is not mad at you and came back to you in a spirit of fair reconciliation.  The goodwill that it should create would probably pay dividends in the future not just with his business but also with others when he tells them about it."
185422,irishfield,2008-04-11 14:29:00,26272," You just ""painted"" ... right !"
185427,Gerritt,2008-04-11 14:33:00,6129,"Problem is the structure was probably built after insurance was put into force.. I am sure the insurance company would probably want to see permits and stamped drawings before paying out on the structure..  Not sure here... but I think the insurance company would be looking to sue someone to recoup their costs... especially if proper procedures are not adhered too.   You just cannot build anything you want anywhere you want anymore without proper documentation and permission from the proper authorities.  There are reasons that contractors do things by the book ie. permits, engineers approvals etc... to prevent the Contractor from being sued in case of loss.  Would you underpin a house without an engineers report? highly unlikely. I see little difference here.  Farm building, House, townhouse complex Do things by the book and your safe.  Did the structure conform to the OBC? Did it comply to municipal amendments?  Were loads calculated and verified? were soil tests done to ensure the earth could support the structure? etc etc etc...  There are so many variables here that would have been known conditions had a permit and engineers report been obtained.  G"
185429,irishfield,2008-04-11 14:38:00,26272," Thanks for confirming that tootsie.. so others know I'm not blowing smoke. I type fact, and have copies of the summons to face my $25,000 fine for building without a permit, the anguish scars, the laughter, the tears and the court and lawyer costs receipts paid by the municipality when they got thrown out of court. As well as their apology letter to me in hopes of me dropping my harassment and tresspassing suits against them.   Well thanks John... all I can tell you is that if what I currently build ""falls down""...it's not gonna be a good day !"
185441,napjohn8,2008-04-11 15:11:00,46,"You need to look at many aspects,  a) did he agree to pay your price, oral or written agreement  Your best bet is to claim frustration because it was an event that was forseeable but both of your were unable to control it, best bet is to discharge the cotnract and bear the loss. Its not worth it to fight over a few thousand dollars, make that time up doing another project on the side."
185258,HTHM,2008-04-11 02:54:00,4082,"# 1 I do not need to worry about this client going any where. He understands that it was not my fault the the structure blew over. # 2 As to a building permit, no this was a farm structure. # 3 I know I am not imune to mistakes, and when I mess up I admit it. I did not mess up in this case,I built what was agreed upon. # 4 I suggested that  he make an insurance claim, but he did not want to. # 5 the winds that knoked it down were hurricane force, across an open field. 60 - 70 mph # 6 The client already has aknowleded the fact that he is on the hook for this, however I am trying to decide if I use a # 0 or a # 10 bait holder. ( see, it always comes down to fishing!)"
185264,JohnF,2008-04-11 03:06:00,3494," It doesn't always work out well, but in this case I'd be inclined to sit down with the client and simply ask ask what he thinks would be fair. It might just work out to your advantage in the end. If he's unrealistic then you blow him off, but if he's being fair you can make lots of points and get some some positive promotion out of it. Again, follow your gut.  JF"
185269,LundGuy,2008-04-11 03:25:00,169,"Its simple. If it wasn't your fault then you should get paid in full to do it again. It is at your discretion whether you want to give him a deal or not. If the guy is a very good repeat customer as you say, then give him a deal, but make sure you cover yourself, he will be happy for sure. There is no need to do it for nothing if it was not your fault as you stated. As a contractor and store owner I have had to deal with this type of thing many times. I once had a lady that bought all her plumbing fixtures from me (approx. $25,000 worth).We delivered them to her new house that was semi finished. The next day she called our store to tell us everything was stolen that night. She had to reorder everything again. What would you do in that situation ? What I did was only charge her 10% over my cost to cover handling and delivery.She was glad we didn't charge full price, even though it was not our problem. Its a little different in your situation, because you will lose up to a weeks pay and from no fault of your own. You definitely should get paid. Oh and by the way, it doesn't matter if its on a farm, any structural work requires a permit anywhere in Ontario."
185271,irishfield,2008-04-11 03:30:00,26272, Not so.. I can build as many aircraft hangars as I choose or anything to do with the upkeep of an aerodrome without permits. Province has no constitutional capacity to assess any planning power over an aerodrome. There were no permits pulled for building Terminal Three at Pearson either.. just ask the extremely disappointed city of Mississauga. As far as I know outbuildings on a farm don't need them either and especially not a horse shelter or similar.. as it sounds like what HTH built.
185274,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 03:34:00,6623,"Farm structure? Like a pole barn posts set on concrete rounds? Back filled with dirt to stabilize the posts? Unusual for them to move once tied together, Tornadoes are unusual too though."
185276,LundGuy,2008-04-11 03:36:00,169,"We worked on a farm outside London and they had to have stamped plans and all proper inspections. When I built my barn I had to have everything inspected, as a matter fact they made me change a few things that I did'nt agree with, so they put a stop order until I complied."
185278,JohnF,2008-04-11 03:44:00,3494," Actually, it's not real simple. Whether or not you're at fault, the perception of fault is more important. If you're dealing with a credible consumer (i.e. one who has the ear of many folks in your market area) then the main concern has to be their perception of the problem. You can be right as rain, but if the consumer doesn't think so, it's gonna cost you, one way or another. The real trick for a savvy businessman is to figure out how much he has to give to get the most benefit. He also has to concern himself with how much he can afford to give without getting a rep as a pushover. Most folks respect real professionalism, but sometimes it has to be explained to them first. That takes a certain amount of diplomacy. I think diplomacy is the one thing that really makes the distinction between a true businessman and a mere mechanic (no offence to the mechanics in our midst, but if you're astute, you already know the difference).  Methinks Wayne might be a pretty good example of a true businessman here. At the end of the day you get back more than what you give in business, if you do your giving judiciously.  JF"
185280,knightfisher,2008-04-11 03:49:00,237," No debate here.  When one does a job, it's done professionally or one can expect problems down the road.  You should of done the job ''better'' the first time.  No way I would charge my customer for a job twice, if it was in any way my responsiblity, as you have stated above.  Dan"
185283,bigfish1965,2008-04-11 03:54:00,3382,"I think I would expect a structure ti withstand winds like that. They are rare, but do occur often enough in Ontario to warrant that type of stability. Now I''m not talking about a garden shed, but a structure. I would likely either eat the bill or give back somehow...take the money and donate it to charity in his name."
