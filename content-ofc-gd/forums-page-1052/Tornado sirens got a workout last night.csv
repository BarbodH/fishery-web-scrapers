185930,OhioFisherman,2008-04-12 11:46:00,6623,"Lots of warnings here last night, tornado sirens went off for like 1/2 hour straight, lots of lighting, thunder and a train like sound that turned out to be a train. A lot cooler here today thru Tuesday then it warms back up. Storms make it north?"
185935,Greencoachdog,2008-04-12 12:18:00,8163,"  We got the same thing here Paul, with a pretty good lightning and thunder display this morning too! It'll be ""cold"" here for the next couple of days, highs in the mid 50's down from the mid 80's... it's refreshing right now though!"
185938,Gerritt,2008-04-12 12:42:00,6129,We had a pretty good storm here last night as well...  G
185952,bassboy,2008-04-12 13:23:00,161,Glad you guys are ok!!  I spent some time in Kansas City and so I know what those sirens are like....most eerie sound I have heard....to this day even hearing them on TV makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.   Bill
185965,Smokey,2008-04-12 13:44:00,1278,Glad to hear everything ok for you Paul and Glen as well. It was a miserable storm that moved thru Ontario as well.  Mike
185982,Cookslav,2008-04-12 14:38:00,1457,"We had Tornado Watches and warnings for Sarnia & Lampton Countys yesterday, and got some decent Storms through out Southern Ontario last night but nothing sever really materialized to my knowlage?  It was just nice to have some electricity in the air again....its been a while"
185985,Joey,2008-04-12 14:39:00,9122," Sheesh, that's enough to make you run to the basement and hide eh, ha ha ha.  I'm glad you are all okay. We had a good thunder boomer up where I am also.  I have a feeling this year is going to throw us some nasty weather.  Joey"
185994,Mike01,2008-04-12 14:54:00,378,We got the Northern edge of it (SNOW)!!

186424,OhioFisherman,2008-04-13 11:18:00,6623,"Pretty rural where I am at, small towns scattered roughly 8 to 10 miles apart, must go back to the horse and buggy days where that was a good trip. Sirens are noisy but all in all a good idea, lots of flat open land and we get them in the area more than the city folks.  No reports of damage anywhere around me, hope it went that well for everyone."
186425,lew,2008-04-13 11:27:00,12767,"We've had a couple tornadoes hit around our trailer park over the years Paul, infact I just missed one by about 15 minutes one time.  Right after I went thru a small town....Cavan near Peterboro....a tornado touched down and destroyed a stone house that totally disappeared, then ripped the brick steeple off the church across the road.  Scary suff, but everyone got outta that one safely."
