He led the way to his bedroom where there was a big brass gong and a mallet.  'What's with that big brass gong?' one of the guests asked. 'It's not a gong. It's a talking clock,' the Newfie replied. 'A talking clock? Seriously?' asked his astonished friend. 'Yup' replied the Newfie. 'How's it work?' the friend asked, squinting at it.  'Watch' the Newfie replied. He picked up the mallet, gave the gong an ear-shattering pound, and stepped back. The three stood looking at one another for a moment.  Suddenly, someone on the other side of the wall screamed, 'You %&&$$!  It's three-fifteen in the morning!"
