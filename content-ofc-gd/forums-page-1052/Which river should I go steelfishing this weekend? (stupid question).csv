The reason being is that I have made all the arrangements already so that I gotta go regardless of the weather .. sigh  any advices are welcome!"
185929,dheitzner,2008-04-12 11:39:00,314,maybe the niagara???
185934,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-12 12:12:00,4399,Lots of steelheaders around here I am sure they`ll give you their spots.LOL
185940,pikehunter,2008-04-12 12:53:00,1659,"I don't know where to try but stay off of that ""Private Property."""
185963,Billy Bob,2008-04-12 13:35:00,5865,Lower Niagara River. It don't get no better than that  Oops........ there might be ice flows preventing you from fishing.
186006,Scott S,2008-04-12 15:55:00,203,The Notty is a total right off. Be another week at least! Lots of guys fishing at Thornburry! Scooter
186007,canadian_copper,2008-04-12 16:01:00,925,IF YOU CAN FIND A FISHABLE RIVER BY SUNDAY IN SOUTHERN ONT YOU LET ME KNOW!!!LOL
186014,jonnybass,2008-04-12 16:39:00,346,Try Graham Creek. There's one good pool that usually holds lot's of fish.
186017,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-12 16:46:00,0,I would suspect most all rivers in Southern Ontario will be blown .. but since I must go .. want to go to places with better luck ..  any advices?
186043,canadian_copper,2008-04-12 17:40:00,925,HONESTLY YOUR JUST GONNA BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND ROE BRO!!! STILL RAINING OUT HERE NOW!!! DROVE BY OSHAWA AN HR AGO AND IT LOOKED LIKE NIAGARA JUST UNDER THE FALLS  LOL
186072,Pachone,2008-04-12 19:06:00,276,went this morning for kicks and to check out some new spots. Water is chocolate everywhere in east durham....Still fun though but no luck
186074,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-12 19:12:00,0,Ok .. so Oshawa is out of the question ...  any updates?
186078,jonnybass,2008-04-12 19:23:00,346,"You picked the wrong weekend.  (Last weekend was good)  Maybe you could try chucking spoons at the creek mouths, working the mudline."
186080,misfish,2008-04-12 19:24:00,29133,"Dont tell anyone,but I hear Thornburry is not bad. Like I said,dont tell anyone."
186081,Stoty,2008-04-12 19:36:00,2910, HAHAHAHAHA  Dont be an internet Hero though......
186084,jonnybass,2008-04-12 19:48:00,346," The conditions might not be too bad, but I hear the fishing is nowhere near what it used to be there."
186104,Canuck2fan,2008-04-12 20:41:00,1444,Best bet would be find a pier and fish the mud line.... Bottom fishing could work where the waters mix as the lake water might be colder and clear with the dirty river water on top. Or so I am telling myself as I too am going tomorrow regardless of weather and expect to do OK. Even if I don't get fish it beats sitting home on the couch thinking about it.....
186129,solopaddler,2008-04-12 21:25:00,8605,"There's a couple of Georgian Bay trib's that should fish well this Sunday. Fill your car with gas, grab a map and go check 'em out."
186133,irishfield,2008-04-12 21:31:00,26272, Well when the season's done and passed you by... check out the lift reports that are already currently @ 3 x last years fish numbers.
186203,peter,2008-04-13 00:08:00,2,"Christian,  Stay home and prepare your gear for opener"
186214,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-13 00:28:00,278,"Had to go to Trenton today. On the way back, I thought I'd stop at Corbett's dam on the Ganny.  The water was half way up the hole for the fish ladder and the waves were coming up onto the sidewalk.  The water looked like flowing mud, with LOTS of trees and other debris coming down over the dam, and there is no longer two shutes down the dam. The water was coming over the centre part as well.  I'd wait a few days.  If ever it was unfishable, today is one of those days."
186262,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-04-13 01:39:00,0,"Any words on places like Thornbury, Meaford?  Thanks"
