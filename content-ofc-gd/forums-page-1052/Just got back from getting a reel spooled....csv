186145,Wendel,2008-04-12 21:52:00,213,"We are hoping to take the boat out, depends how frosty it is in the morning."
186146,danbouck,2008-04-12 21:54:00,4380,FYI The bay is very muddy right now and nobody is catch'n much!

186149,Wendel,2008-04-12 21:59:00,213,"Well, maybe we will wait til next weekend.... We are both dying to get the boat out though lol"
186152,danbouck,2008-04-12 22:03:00,4380, I'm in the same boat! I have the weekend off so that I can go down to the bay but it doesn't look like it's gonna happen!
186153,Billy Bob,2008-04-12 22:04:00,5865,Looks like money Well spent. Those Dipsy Divers catch fish when nothing else will produce.  Bob

186174,2 tone z71,2008-04-12 22:47:00,1311,really im gonna have to look into a set of them babys
186175,skeeter,2008-04-12 22:49:00,1907,WENDEL:  did you atleast get your reel respooled or did you forget????  LOL   Dann
186200,richyb,2008-04-13 00:04:00,774,Looks like your ready for the big ones now
186256,Wendel,2008-04-13 01:30:00,213, Surprisingly when you buy that much stuff they spool the lines for free lol
186263,SlowPoke,2008-04-13 01:41:00,2984,I hope they didn't charge you for installation - the rod on the right has the reel on backwards. Are those the new Rapala linecounters? -Brian
186270,kickingfrog,2008-04-13 01:47:00,8333,"With a title like that I was expecting a story worthy of Hemingway, about the fight of your life. Good to see it was just some money lost. Need someone to use that other rod and dippsy?"
186273,Wendel,2008-04-13 01:48:00,213, Actually I put it on backwards myself... I was wondering how long it would be before someone noticed lol
186275,Sinker,2008-04-13 01:49:00,8692,  Ha....I was thinking the same thing. Expected to be reading the story of a huge one that got away..........  Sinker
186510,JohnF,2008-04-13 15:19:00,3494," Another guy who isn't worried about photographing the evidence.  I dropped in to the Fishing Store in Stratford (run by a protege of Joslyn's from Woodstock) the other day and walked out with a Quantum baitcaster combo and an Okuma flyrod setup. He had too many great deals. I'm becoming adept at mixing the new stuff up with the old in my toy room downstairs so She Whom I Fear The Most doesn't catch on. She still thinks my rod/reel sets cost $19.95 at CTC or Gander Mountain.  One thing about fishing - it's sure a lot cheaper than scuba diving. I just sold a lot of my coldwater & cave type dive gear, so I could be buying great fishing stuff for quite a few years with what I got. She doesn't have any sympathy with that argument though. She wants to fritter away the money on new furniture for the pool yard and new floor covering for the back deck.  JF"
186523,Wendel,2008-04-13 16:17:00,213,"  She was with me at the time.... She was the one that wanted the pretty spinner baits lol Jos gave her a lesson on spinner baits, it was quite interesting for her..."
186575,JohnF,2008-04-13 19:41:00,3494, Mebbe I need to take my wife down to Woodstock to visit Jos. I won't get my hopes up though.  JF
