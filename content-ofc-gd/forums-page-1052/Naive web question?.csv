185554,Stoty,2008-04-11 18:07:00,2910,"I would assume that the sponser of the banner would have tracking on it, to tell where the user clicked from. And if they see that a lot of traffic is coming from the OFC site, they are more likely to keep paying OFC to advertise here."
185649,kickingfrog,2008-04-11 21:20:00,8333,"Figured that's the way it works. Heck, what's an extra click or two."
185651,irishfield,2008-04-11 21:22:00,26272,"TTBOMK they pay strictly for how many times their ""link"" appears on a page. Don't think there's any extra because you choose to check them out by clicking on it."

185686,Roy,2008-04-11 22:28:00,13728,"The banners at the top right of your screen are our clients and friends who pay a modest sum yearly to have their banners on our site. Each of their banners get 500-600 views per day. Clicking on these banners will open a new window and you will be linked the their website.  The large banner in the middle of your screen (above the ""add reply"" button) is a Google ad(s). We are paid both by the number of views and number of clicks on those ads. People have tried to defraud the system by clicking on these ads many more times than they've needed to. This only generates an error and the IP addy of the clicker is flagged.  We can vouch for the clients and friends advertising here. We cannot necessarily vouch for the folks advertising here through Google. The Google ads are subject sensitive and we have no control over which ads show up UNLESS we get complaints about an ad being offensive. In that case, we can take steps to have that advertiser blocked from our site.  The revenue generated from our banners and the Google ads is what pays to keep our site going and the ongoing upkeep here.  It wasn't a naive question. Just something that we've never been asked so...I hope this answers your question."
185705,muskymike,2008-04-11 23:10:00,772,"Great response Roy. Makes it very clear.  We should put together some sort of system, if it generates money from the site, that each day you have to click the banner. not overdoing it, but just showing support.  Its probably a lot more complicated to get everyone to buy into it, let alone set up some type of system, but its a thought.  Just tryin to help out."
185724,jonnybass,2008-04-11 23:50:00,346, That's a good way to get OFC banned from Google Adsense.
