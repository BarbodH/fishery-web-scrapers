186194,Gerritt,2008-04-12 23:36:00,6129,Only difference appears to be line capacity and weight of the reel..  Here is a link with more info  http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com/inc/sdetail/570  G
186198,Raf,2008-04-13 00:01:00,3495,"get the 6501.  difference?  bigger (stronger) gears, drag washers, etc."
186202,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-13 00:08:00,278,"I have both those reels.  Winches!!  For muskie, get the 6501.  You wont be dissapointed"
186205,muskymike,2008-04-13 00:12:00,772,"Get the C4 its a little more but worth it or the record, the gears have a lot to do with it"
186251,brickNblock,2008-04-13 01:25:00,598," Mike............... Sorry Bud and teammate.........But, What/who told you the C-4 is better then the C-3........ I could be so completely wrong on this and way out of line but from what ive heard the C-4's are a reel to stay away from and in that series of Abu the C-3 is the only way to go. I suppose it is what you intend the useage for........ Ive a couple of C-3 6501's....Theyve put up with a lot of abuse and are still clickin'.. Ive also a 5501 ..but that is now the wifies....... My confidence reels are all Shimano. Catela 301...love this little guy, great casting. Calcutta Te 401..(x2)..my go to buds) Calcutta 400...well, this one is for guests. I needed a 7000 for heavy trolling and managed to pick an Abu7000 at a great price....yes, its a righty.  White007...if you dont want to spend the money on a calcutta (te401) go with the C3 6501. Exellent starter reel for almost all applications. bNb"
186287,mattyk,2008-04-13 02:16:00,2110,go with the C3 6500.
186365,2 tone z71,2008-04-13 03:48:00,1311,"ive got 2 C3s havent used them yet also got a Tekota for trolling and a Calcutta for casting,you cannot go wrong with Shimano last thing ya need is to get a 50 incher on and the reel fails"
186403,lew,2008-04-13 09:06:00,12767,I'd stick with the C3 & go with the 6501 too.  It's a very dependable reel but basic and no frills around the edges but will serve you well.  Sorta like an old Chevy with no power steering.
