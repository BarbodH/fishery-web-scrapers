She said hello. he was rather taken aback because he couldn't place where he knew her from. So he said, ""Do you know me?"" To which she replied, ""I think you're the father of one of my kids.""  Now his mind travels back to the only time he has ever been unfaithful to his wife and said, ""My God, are you the stripper from my bachelor party that I made love to on the pool table with all my buddies watching while your partner sprayed us both with whipped cream?""  She looks into his eyes and says calmly, ""No, I'm your son's teacher."""
