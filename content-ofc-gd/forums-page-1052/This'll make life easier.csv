185967,lew,2008-04-12 13:55:00,12767,"I do alot of fishing well after dark and it's sometimes awkward getting the boat back on the trailer in the pitch black, or even getting the trailer backed in straight when you can't see the ramp, specially when I'm fishing alone.  I've been looking around for some sort of portable light to attach to the roof of my truck to illuminate the ramp and surrounding area while I'm backing up the trailer and found this one in CTC this morning for $40 and it looks like it'll be perfect for the job.  It's about 8"" wide, has a strong magnet to hold it to the roof, 20' of cord to reach the lighter socket and is extremely bright.  Could also be handy around a dark campsite too.  Just thought some may be interested in it for the same reason as me.    I have a lighter socket in back of my truck which makes it very easy.  "

186179,Bernie,2008-04-12 22:59:00,3190,I always thought you went to bed before it got dark. How else do you get up at the crack of dawn?
