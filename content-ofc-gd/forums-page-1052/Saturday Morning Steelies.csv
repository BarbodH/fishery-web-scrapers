I recently tore the meniscus muscle in my knee so im very limited in my movements which made river fishing impossible, so i headed out west and grabbed my lawn chair, floating roe bags and relaxed...enjoy.  I got 4 in the day (only have 2 pics), all within the first hour we got there.... after that nothing..biggest was 9lbs 11 oz...    Brian with his only fish on the day   Nick with his first ever steelhead.   dobee"
