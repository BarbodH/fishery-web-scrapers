185641,superdad,2008-04-11 21:07:00,353,"Well, It's a tough job but someone has to do it.....  Laker John had installed his new 15HP four stroke and it REALLY needed a field test, so no better chance than a sunny Thursday before the lousy weather set in for the weekend.  All my household painting chores had been completed and we were off like a herd of turtles, heading for Lake Ontario. Having checked the water temps (courtesty of Michigan Univ.) we suspected that it might be the right time.  We got out to fish around 1430 and headed west on our first trolling pass, nothing was happening and we began to doubt if in fact the 'time was right'. The two and a half waves from the south kept us bouncing and trying to see if there was a strike in the planer boards.  As we made our turn after our run, the inside board pulled in an strange way, Laker said, ""Grab the rod and see what it is"". After taking the board off the line, there was a fish there. I was able to land a nice 16"" brown trout on the trout producer - Alpena Diamond........  'Hey the fish are here', we both cried......  Continuing back on our line, heading east that same board and same lure, except this time the board was knocked off with a vicious strike. Laker John reeled a real beauty to the boat.    This was a beauty and it went back to the water.  I won't bore you with the details of the rest of our fishing day, suffice to say that we fished for four hours and we landed seven brown trout, six on the Alpena Diamond and one on a Copper Toronto Wabler.  The water ranged between 40.5 and 42 degs, there were pockets of warmer water and we got our fish trolling around 2.3-2.4 MPH.  Landing at 1845, we took a couple of Pix for the record.    We held the same fish for the Pictures.    We hope to get back again soon and see if we can find some of the bigger fish.   Stay Tuned"
