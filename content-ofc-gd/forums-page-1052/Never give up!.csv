186001,Tybo,2008-04-12 15:26:00,1373,I love it when he looks into the camera. WHAT IN THE LORD THUNDERN JESUS did i just do. Now thats dedication.
186009,Fang,2008-04-12 16:17:00,1330,That was awesome
186040,snagmaster,2008-04-12 17:38:00,250,wow Rob...thats was some crazy stuff....would you do that on lake O in a salmon tourney?? A king would take you for a ride...lol
186096,silveradosheriff,2008-04-12 20:20:00,1025,I saw Rob attempt that (involuntarily) in a Salmon tourney last summer. Good thing he didn't make the plunge....cuz they weren't about to stop the boat.  
186106,setomonkey,2008-04-12 20:47:00,872,Now that's commitment to landing a fish no matter what happens!  LOL  Mike
186343,bassslinger,2008-04-13 03:13:00,21,To be the best you need that kind of intensity and focus... Ike would have done that on Simcoe in the fall if there was a tournament on the line. Worry about the cold after the fish is in the livewell.
