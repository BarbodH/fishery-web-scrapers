There were no adventures along the way, thankfully...grin.  I had no trouble importing my boat, just pay the taxes and go... We/re glad to be back in Canada, and looking forward to getting home to Apsley on the weekend.  My neighbour says that the snow in the driveway is almost gone and I will be able to get in and out by then. Garry2Rs"
