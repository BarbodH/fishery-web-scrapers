183481,jiggz,2008-04-07 22:50:00,9,"yes marshmallow (you can get this anywhere, small ones) instead of salmon egg.  Sometime they sell at fishng stores, coloured versions , called glo-mello something like that. its good at night time & murky water conditions."
183838,jdmls,2008-04-08 17:07:00,575,"do a search on CCMT or BLY 's posts......all they do is fish at night for steelhead.....they seem to do very well !!! Word for warning though... look out for the WEIRDOS  at nite, LOL"
183870,ccmtcanada,2008-04-08 18:21:00,7971, I told you before....stop calling us weirdos!!!! LOL
183881,Mark Kulik,2008-04-08 19:02:00,348,"Don't fish night anymore but had very good success with large gooey hot pink roe bags-usually tied from skein for added scent, with a small plastic luminiscent egg, on the hook shank- with a float and lightstick -slow pools are best, once in a while have to charge the egg with a small flashlight or light source."
185637,Pachone,2008-04-11 20:56:00,276,"I was just fishing in the nite for trout first time and had big troubles LOL. One being, i couldnt see my float...What is this lightstick you speak of? any recomondation night lures for non float fishing?"
185666,jonnybass,2008-04-11 21:44:00,346,"You can use floats with glow sticks, or use LED floats."
185679,Rich,2008-04-11 22:11:00,3927,Don't forget some glow in the dark Cleos!
