We managed to find the fish and in a couple of hours landed 14 channel cats while losing only two.  It was a great day on the water with some nice cats ranging in weight from 5lbs to 21lbs.  Right now the Channel Cats are definately biting.            Thanks to the Guys that stopped by today... Nice Cats.  Great seeing some board members out there enjoying the weather lately. "
