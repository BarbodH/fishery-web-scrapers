Nothing,but did watch a flock of crows harrass a hawk for about 3 minutes. Decided I would take a sunday drive and headed a little north. I always get this guy saying, get up here and get these birds,so I headed up. I arrive around 7:45 and thought it might be a bit early,but still knocked on the shop door. Nope, no answer,thought maybe he went to church,or even took the boat out. So I scouted the field for a few minutes,NO BIRDS. What a fibber.HAHAHAHAHA. I must say though,you do keep the runway nice and clear.    So I decide to take a drive down to the water to see whats up.I came accross this nice painting.Nice to see this in the small towns.    Head down to the launch area,no Wayne. Guess it will be awhile before you get out Wayne.    The boats were still ice locked.    As you can see from this one,still lots of ice out there in the bay.    Then I see this and thought maybe go for a swim   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOT  Headed back home,nice morning for a sunday drive."

HAHAHAHA  Felt bad for Martin. Thanks  MTP,It was wierd to se areas with lots of snow and others with nil on my drive.
