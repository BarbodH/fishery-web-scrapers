184772,irishfield,2008-04-10 04:02:00,26272,Can't believe I'm gonna say it... but I think I'm good for the season.. other than a bit of terminal tackle.. high quality snaps and swivels basically. Got everything else covered. Rods/reels/line/spoons/cranks... all covered thanks to Ebay thru the winter.
184879,tinbanger,2008-04-10 14:47:00,1028,thanks for posting Irishfield  some good deals especially the survival suits and drift socks . tempted but see the 'pros' using buckets (blue seems to work the best) for trolling so guess thats good enough for us .  save the $ for gas this summer  TB
184907,irishfield,2008-04-10 16:26:00,26272,Bucket's easier to throw and retrieve as well Dave.. and has other uses once on board.. like bailing !
184910,largemouth,2008-04-10 16:32:00,112,  pull the proper cord and a drift sock is easier to retrieve.........
184922,tinbanger,2008-04-10 16:53:00,1028,maybe but try bailing with a drift sock !  Also works as a head for the boat  TB
184927,largemouth,2008-04-10 16:58:00,112," Yes i agree with common sense, just not the other statement about a bucket being easier to retieve than a drift sock.....lol."
