182176,Roy,2008-04-05 08:44:00,13728,"Interesting to see how music has evolved. I remember going to the Showmart in Montreal in 1959. For $2.00 I got to rub shoulders with Sue Thompson, Fabian, Jerry Lee Lewis and the Ventures. The Ventures were instrumental (pun intended) in my buying my first guitar which I still have today. HERE's a little clip, pretty lame by today's standards but it was what I really enjoyed at the time. The bonus was, they were using Mosrites."
