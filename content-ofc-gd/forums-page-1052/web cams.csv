186137,skeeter,2008-04-12 21:38:00,1907,heres my thought:   why dont we have a section on here for web cam chat so you can put a face to the people your talking to? this way when you see them out on the water you know who they are !
186144,huntervasili,2008-04-12 21:52:00,1604,Possibly the costs associated with it... but I know MSN is free and allows you to use that feature
186159,Gerritt,2008-04-12 22:16:00,6129,Bad enough we see GCD half naked in pictures... I do not need to see him in video too...   G
186161,Bernie,2008-04-12 22:23:00,3190,Ya and the next thing would be live chat. With Wayne around nobody else would get a word in!   Sorry to pick on you Wayne but I think you are topdog on the post count.
186163,irishfield,2008-04-12 22:25:00,26272,Sorry Bernie.. I might be up to a web cam chat with Joey or Carole..... but none of you lads!
186165,forrest,2008-04-12 22:28:00,1032,There was this station that just played that burning firelog....there was a video too.  They both did well:  A feature where you get to watch some other lucky guy fishing might be good.  It would certainly be unique.   forrest
186168,Gerritt,2008-04-12 22:33:00,6129,  you mean like this....  http://www.ontariofishingreels.com/   ??  G
186171,Bernie,2008-04-12 22:38:00,3190,"Quite a few folks I know on MSN that have it. But we rarely use the feature. Trouble is you can only yak on it to one person at a time.  Well now that you mentioned it from that perspective Wayne, it may be alright after all."
186172,skeeter,2008-04-12 22:43:00,1907,no bernie you go into a chat room and every one can talk there. and you can view everyones cam too   Dann
186176,Bernie,2008-04-12 22:52:00,3190,"Skeeter, unless they changed it recently using a web cam and a microphone was only one person at a time.    Sorry I got a little mixed up there. Live chat does not mean using a microphone."
186177,Gerritt,2008-04-12 22:55:00,6129,You used to be able to do that on Yahoo....  However they have since removed the feature that allows you to create and control your own rooms..  Not sure of anywhere really where you are able to do what your looking for to be honest.. To much liability involved..  Yahoo removed theirs to keep kids safe.  G
186279,huntervasili,2008-04-13 01:58:00,1604,"Lots of free programs for live talking with mics, not sure of the video though... There is Teamspeak and Ventrillo for live mic chat... Both free programs"
186286,Greencoachdog,2008-04-13 02:12:00,8163,"  Web cams are for pervs!!!  We do the fishin' report thing with pics of people holding their fish so you can put the face with the name... unless you're too scared, paranoid, chickens**t, or on the FBI's 10 most wanted list to post a pic with your face in it!!!"
186314,HTHM,2008-04-13 02:49:00,4082,As soon as I catch a fish worth showing you'll see my ugly mug
186386,forrest,2008-04-13 05:06:00,1032," I didn't see any live webcams there, only cherry picked taped footage.  I mean like sticking a webcam up on the pier (like MTO does ont he 401) or some guys boat (like clubs do).  forrest"
