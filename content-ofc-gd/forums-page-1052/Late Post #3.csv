185829,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 02:44:00,0, HOLY .... I guess no one likes a heads up  Anyone ever considered I might be wrong about the location? Gzzz you people
185830,Gerritt,2008-04-12 02:45:00,6129,"Fishon... I have seen about enough... take your centrepin, take your barbless hooks and take your attitude elsewhere.  I said it in your first post..  You're an ass.  G"
185833,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 02:50:00,0,Thank god there are other species to fish besides steelhead. I can't wait to go back on the boat and fish in peace.  Gerritt ... if it bugs you sooooooo much... just stop posting?
185836,Sinker,2008-04-12 02:53:00,8692,"  Regardless of whether your wrong on the location or not, if its posted no tresspassing, let the authorities deal with it. Nobody needs a heads up about an area that's posted no tresspassing! If its not posted, then there is nothing stopping anyone from going in there......all they can get is kicked off the property. If they choose not to leave, then they will be charged......  Who are you to put anyone on the spot, or give a heads up about tresspassing?  Sinker"
185838,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 02:56:00,8333,"On a hyjacking note. Why is it that the guy on the shore with a $500 float reel, thinks he's superior to a guy in a tinny and a 10hp outboard? I know the guy in the boat could buy at least 4 of my set-ups, and yet I know I'm the better person???"
185841,irishfield,2008-04-12 02:58:00,26272,"So.. here's your original original post.  ""Hey Bro's .... sorry for another late post but I been busy. Here are some of the pictures I took the day after reading Steverowbotham's post not long ago. A bunch of my friends recongnized the backgrounds and decided to fish the so called ""Secret Krek"" the next day and had good results. We didn't want to alert other anglers by parking near ""access points"" so we parked our vans far far away. I won't name the ""Secret Krek"" since our family friend that owns the land does not want more tresspassers, guys that need to post to build self esteem, idiots, newbies, litter bugs etc... to be crossing his land. Whoever is reading this please don't take this as a personal attack, unless you are tresspassing. If you are caught tresspassing you will be charged and I hope Mitch the Conservation Officer arrives in time to slap tresspassers with more fines"".  So, now which is it... you did indeed recognized the creek or maybe you had the wrong location? Your family friend owns the property or it's owned by OPG? It's obvious your post has served one purpose and one purpose only... and that's to keep us entertained on a rainy Friday night."
185842,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:00:00,0,   Sinker ... easy on the lead.  I did not put anyone on the SPOT FOR TRESSPASSING!!!! Reread the post... want a screen show before i did all the editing? The mod even took a screen shot for me .. gzzzzz ....  Now your telling me I also shouldn't tell a person to not drink and drive.... Catch my drift? ??  Do what you guys want with the info!!!
185843,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:03:00,0,  Great so it doesn't say I am targetting Steve .. whoooah .. thank goodness  I haven't even confirmed with steve about the location nor did I say he was tresspassing did I? LOL ... you guys are silly !!!  Hurry jump on the bandwagon and cyber bully an unfamiliar poster
185845,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 03:03:00,8333,"  I would, but I'll get crap all over my keyboard."
185847,Joey,2008-04-12 03:04:00,9122," Just this part alone of your thread in the first post shows you were trying to stir up trouble Fishon.  You must think we haven't figured that out.  Yet we have and we're calling you on it and now you're playing the ""I'm only trying to educate you people"" card.  Its not flying so give it up."
185848,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:05:00,0,"  I can recommend where you can buy toilet paper, but who am I?"
185849,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 03:06:00,8333,ouch
185851,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:07:00,0, ok .. are you one of them? ....  Hold on .. the educate part is also in the beginning of this thread...  Hmm ....
185853,Sinker,2008-04-12 03:10:00,8692,"Re read my post, I didnt' say you put anyone on the spot FOR TRESSPASSING. When you mention someones name in a post, its usually putting them on the spot.....no?  Why did you post your report in the first place?"
185866,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:26:00,0,  I didn't bash him right? So I guess i did nothing wrong....  why did you bother replying? move on ...  In my third repost .. i took the persons alias out of it so i don't get how i put the guy on the spot?  I edited after my first and second report was posted and in all fairness a mod sent me a pm about my post 1+2 violation right after my third one was up.. i'm sure he will remove or lock this if he disagree with the third post.   You people should all stop playing moderator. This Friday brings back memories why I stopped moderatting  I'm gonna take a break from this thread....  i'll leave this up to the mods...    I am more than willing to talk over PM and leave this thread alone  Cheers
185869,kingofthesteelhead,2008-04-12 03:29:00,140,In case it is not known this is Graham Creek in Newcastle and there is a alocal idiot that thinks he can control this water and will even call the cops or co on you. He had friend of mine charged with trespassing there. He does not own the water but because he knows someone from there he thinks he does!
185870,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 03:30:00,0,and I like to thank everyone that actually agree with me via PM and shown support for me in this thread.  GOOD FISHIN!!
185877,Roy,2008-04-12 03:48:00,13728,"Well, this has all been wonderful. Sleep well every one. Fishon, you can sleep well too...your 4% vacation pay will be waiting for you at the door. Night everyone."

185806,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 02:19:00,0,  Some people may or may not realize the area they are fishing is private property and for those that know they are tresspassign ...well consider it as a heads up since the land lord is ready to call the cops and C/O.   Good enough reason for you?
185807,DanTheMan,2008-04-12 02:20:00,257,
185808,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 02:21:00,0,  What's so funny?  LOL don't get me started on this one now
185809,ccmtcanada,2008-04-12 02:23:00,7971," I dont buy it....you mentioned Bowmanville in your other thread as well....I think you just like to stir up crap on here.  You know that people are very protective about locations, yet you go ahead and post creek names in your reports.  Oh yeah...so mentioning a little known creek that holds lots of fish will reduce trespassers...not likely..."
185817,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 02:32:00,0,  Hold on . ? Protective about locations? Why post pics with recongnizable backgrounds if you don't want people to know about it.... was it my fault for calling six of my friends and then posting my results?  I sense a little jealousy !!! It must suck to not land any fish on outtings.
185818,aniceguy,2008-04-12 02:32:00,1094,"ok this is getting dumb now  the creek is 10 feet wide at the most, in order to fish the only real pool on it you pretty much need to tresspass in order to fish it....fishing 10 ft wide creeks isnt steelheading LOL its an utter joke and to trespass to boot well I think q107 had something called tool of the day.....re read my post why tresspassing isnt a good thing"
185821,JustinHoffman,2008-04-12 02:34:00,482,"I know each particular species raises the ire of some folk, but why does virtually every steelhead thread resort to name calling, belittling, and high and mighty posturing.....(I used to think musky anglers were the worst for this stuff   )  Back in the late 80's and early 90's, I used to do a tonne of steelheading. I still remember getting my Mom to drop me off at the Thickson Road bridge of the Oshawa creek, and pick me up some 8 hours later down at the Rossland Road junction. Those were the days - plenty of fish to be caught and never any issues....  I haven't picked up a noodle rod since then, and quite honestly, I don't want to. Same reason I gave up golf - became too much of an elitist sport for me, just like chasing trout has.  Nope, I'll stick to a shallow shoreline and a bunch of flipping jigs....never have to deal with the ridiculousness of fishing when in that element.  I'm all for being serious out on the boat, but do any of you steelheaders actually have a day of laughter and fun out there???  As for tresspassing - that should just be common knowledge to folk.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
185824,highdrifter,2008-04-12 02:37:00,2534,"What did I miss?!  Not exactly sure how or why this came about, but can I fish there???  Dem some noice troutsies though!  HD"
185826,buckster,2008-04-12 02:38:00,530,I think we should have a m&G at the don to discuss this
185745,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 00:55:00,0,"For some reason my recent post was deleted. If it was because i broke some rules please be kind enough to let me know.  This is for all the Bro's and Gal's...  About a couple of weeks ago while reading Someones post we knew where to fish the following day so a a bunch of us parked our vans away from common access points to not attract the lurking ""angler"" as our family friend that owns the land does not like the extra attention since people need to tresspass to access the ditch behind his property. If it wasn't for tresspassers, and internet posters that post to build self esteem and cause unwanted attention to his property then he wouldn't mind granting temporary access to the lucky few. On top of all that he is sick of people leaving foot prints, littering on his property, and leave gutted fish on his property. Anyways to the few that are allowed permission to fish keep fishing and those that are tresspassing well be prepared to explain to a cop or Mitch the conservation officer why you were tresspassing.  The only reason if anyone is offended by this post is if they are guilty of tresspassing!!!  Here are the results from that day.  Started off as a cold morning so we used the net.            By the way I left out the rainbow picture being dragged by a Muskrat incase anyone found it to be offensive.   *Note* I was not saying Steverowbothan was TRESSPASSING in my previous post, just that i recongnize the river he fished so my friends knew where to fish the following day. No where in my previous post stated STEVE WAS TRESSPASSING.  I hope this is CLEAR  now.  Anyone have ""Graham"" crackers to go with my coffee???  Please release all your wild bows"
185746,irishfield,2008-04-12 00:57:00,26272,You playing by baseball rules?

185755,irishfield,2008-04-12 01:13:00,26272,At least on the third round it's less condesending Terry. Should have read take 1 !
185756,aniceguy,2008-04-12 01:15:00,1094,I cant find the other threads but Im assuming it was about someone tresspassing on private property to access a section of river for the purpose of steelhead fishing am I correct
185758,Gerritt,2008-04-12 01:16:00,6129,"Terry... This is his third thread concerning the exact same thing..  The mods removed the first two...  Perhaps they are leaving this one to embarrass the poster into submission?  His attitude sucks, in his first thread he was pretty much calling Steve a trespasser, in his second I was one because I let him know he was being a turd in the first one.. so he stated I had to be guilty..  Sigh.....Steelheaders.....  I am just thankful they are not all like this...  G"
185759,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 01:17:00,0,  CORRECT

185762,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 01:19:00,0,  Anyone can walk on the land. If you get caught you get charged. The reason for this thread is to respect private property!!!. How would you like it if people just walk through your property to fish ?
185764,Gerritt,2008-04-12 01:25:00,6129,"Fishon... welcome to OFC...but you are fighting a losing battle I am afraid... sure property rights need to be respected...   BUT..................   I HIGHLY doubt, the intention of your report was to provide a report on fish... but was indeed a lamely disguised as an attack on a member of our board...   Your message might be the right one... but the manner in which you are presenting it leaves little to be desired.  Gerritt."
185766,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 01:26:00,0,"  I have saved the original post and all i changed was removed steverowbotham name and replaced it with ""someone"" and i also took out a pic of a hen that was left for the muskrat.  So laugh and make up all the turd you want ... internet hero"
185768,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-12 01:29:00,0, But you had to reply back to this thread. I guess it isn't a waste of your time after all.

185770,Gerritt,2008-04-12 01:30:00,6129,    in your second post you replaced it with st3v3 or some nonsense....  Internet Hero eh?  w00t! Where is my cape??!!  To Infinity and Beyond!  G
