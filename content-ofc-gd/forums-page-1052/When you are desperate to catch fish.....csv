185542,kickingfrog,2008-04-11 17:44:00,8333," You could, but someone would say they caught a bigger one."
185545,yellowboat,2008-04-11 17:46:00,211,Thats very cool
185566,LeXXington,2008-04-11 18:29:00,1928,"Very cool,"
185598,HTHM,2008-04-11 19:31:00,4082,I wonder how well they would work as bait?????
185647,kickingfrog,2008-04-11 21:18:00,8333,  Now there is a true angler.
185670,kickingfrog,2008-04-11 21:50:00,8333,"  The guy in marketing /promotions would have 100's of colours, multiple sizes, sallow and deep diving options."
185675,shane,2008-04-11 22:04:00,652,"I bet, in a few more years, we will all be using miniaturized versions of those as fishing lures."
185678,Gerritt,2008-04-11 22:10:00,6129,I recall seeing this on Discovery a couple years ago...  Still amazing  G
185692,bullybass,2008-04-11 22:45:00,144,so cool!!! Where do I get one??
185714,wuchikubo,2008-04-11 23:31:00,1114,Miniture versions would be great in an aquarium and would keep the guests busy!
185735,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 00:15:00,8333, I remember that I think as well. It was more of a tuna design. Speed/ efficient movement was the goal.
185748,Nemo,2008-04-12 00:58:00,727,Invasive species like Carp.
185763,Gerritt,2008-04-12 01:20:00,6129,  soon to be added to the Grand River... Electric Carp! w00t! get your bait now.. there will be a shortage on AA's  G
